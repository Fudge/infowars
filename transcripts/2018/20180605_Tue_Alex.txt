[00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:19.811]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:27.015]  Well, Gert Wilders has now decided to spearhead Tommy Robinson protests in London.
[00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:32.198]  Of course, the truth about why Tommy Robinson was arrested is the scariest thing.
[00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.640]  Here's a report from our own John Bowne with the latest.
[00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:40.117]  This is why Tommy Robinson is being held as a political prisoner.
[00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:43.399]  Pedophilia has had a long history in England.
[00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.941]  And until recently, even that was covered up.
[00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:51.863]  British entertainer Jimmy Seville victimized young girls on national television.
[00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:59.987]  Openly flaunted abusing 177 patients between the ages of 5 and 75 at 41 hospitals.
[00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.368]  Keeping their eyeballs as souvenirs.
[00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:03.229]  Hospitals have rules.
[00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.890]  With patience and things like that.
[00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.610]  Well, because I'm dyslexic when I want to be.
[00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.890]  I don't understand rules.
[00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.991]  Jimmy Savile's victims have faced years of pain.
[00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:27.194]  We owe it to them and to our audiences to understand how this could have happened and to make sure that everything we do ensures that nothing like this could ever happen again.
[00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:32.675]  Folks, you ask, there's a bizarre satanic ritual being described by children in a video.
[00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:33.315]  Tell us about that.
[00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.896]  Yeah, this is a chilling video, whether it's a hoax or not.
[00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:40.396]  I mean, it's gone completely viral over the weekend.
[00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.317]  It's got over a thousand comments on Reddit.
[00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:45.817]  It's got 200,000 views on the original YouTube video.
[00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:58.600]  And it's basically two young children describing how they were allegedly sexually abused and forced to partake in bizarre satanic baby sacrifice rituals.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:22.121]  Now, after decades of neglect, finally, England must now answer to why the powers that be quietly allowed mainly Pakistani, Kurdish, and Kosovoan Muslim men, according to court records, to form a network of sex trafficking rings all across Great Britain to sadistically rape thousands of English girls for roughly four decades.
[00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:35.427]  We seem to be looking at millions of rapes of white and Sikh girls by Muslim men, only 222 of whom have been convicted since 2005.
[00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:46.812]  So, my Lords, will the government ask our Muslim leaders whether the perpetrators can claim that their behaviour is sanctioned in the Quran and to issue a fatwa against it?
[00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:57.912]  And second, my Lords, will the government encourage a national debate about the various interpretations of Islam?
[00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:01.295]  Can we talk about Islam without being accused of hate crime?
[00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:10.983]  And when you look back to the, for example, the 1970s, we had something like 200,000 Muslims in Britain at that time.
[00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:13.085]  But every decade they've doubled since then.
[00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:16.347]  So the 200,000 became 400,000 became 800,000.
[00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:19.288]  We're now up to 3.2 million.
[00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:24.010]  But as they grow, they start demanding more and they start pushing more.
[00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.373]  And because they back this up with terrorism and with jihad, the government listens to them.
[00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:36.496]  You know, when Mohammed said, I have been made victorious through terror, he's speaking absolutely the truth.
[00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:37.397]  And our government,
[00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:37.737]  I think?
[00:03:57.998 --> 00:03:58.278]  We're good.
[00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:29.779]  But it doesn't stop there now in Europe.
[00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.719]  France has fake news laws that are leaving media experts uneasy.
[00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.641]  So free speech in Europe, well if it's not dead, it's barely got a pulse.
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.896]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:16.406]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:16.406 --> 00:06:21.710]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:36.221]  Indeed, yes, here I am on this Tuesday, June 5th, 2018, filling in for Alex Jones, who tries to take a vacation, but the universe says, not quite yet, Mr. Jones.
[00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:48.123]  As Alex is heading out for vacation, he runs into the leader of the Democrat Socialist Movement, Bernie Sanders.
[00:06:48.123 --> 00:06:59.854]  Now, there's a lot of interesting things in this video, but how about the fact that Bernie Sanders pretty much doesn't even energize a crowd anymore?
[00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:03.257]  Doesn't that show you how the momentum
[00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:12.998]  That the left had, or thought they had, is really coming to a crashing halt, where no one even cares that Bernie's at the airport.
[00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:26.311]  And then you just look at this guy, and you can just see how low energy he is, where his own soyboy security guard has more energy and courage than Bernie does to actually stand up to Alex Jones.
[00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:29.273]  I mean, the guy made a fool of himself, but hey, give him credit, at least he tried!
[00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:37.879]  So Alex Jones tries to go on vacation, the universe gives him Bernie Sanders to confront, and here is the aftermath of that.
[00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:45.827]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:07:45.827 --> 00:07:48.650]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:19.007]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got off our plane here at LAX, and Bernie Sanders, the living embodiment of communist and socialist evil and failure, was here.
[00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:23.489]  A living museum piece of Mao Zedong, or Joseph Stalin, or V.I.
[00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:24.530]  Lenin.
[00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.532]  In fact, after the death of Hugo Chavez, he passed on the mantle.
[00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:33.274]  But of course his little handlers wouldn't let him talk to some proletariat slave like me.
[00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:34.555]  And so this went on for a while.
[00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:35.455]  Then he left the gate,
[00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:39.396]  We went to a little store, he came back by and we talked to him again.
[00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:46.818]  But then his minions came over and put out the same old Democratic talking points they do over and over and over again.
[00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.479]  You talk about brainwashed sheep, you're going to see some of those as well.
[00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.359]  So here it is.
[00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:53.680]  Go on board the ship and see our craft.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.580]  It will be rusty.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.400]  It will be imported.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.761]  Oh, that isn't old Bernie Sanders.
[00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:00.263]  Dude, no, come on, not right now.
[00:09:00.263 --> 00:09:01.124]  No, Senator.
[00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:04.486]  Why'd you say white people didn't know it was like before?
[00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:12.052]  Let me guess, you guys aren't flying first class, are you?
[00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:12.692]  Why's he running?
[00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:17.236]  I don't know why.
[00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:19.838]  I guess flying first class you shouldn't be.
[00:09:19.838 --> 00:09:21.098]  I got a coach ticket in my pocket.
[00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.340]  We don't do that in Venezuela.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.441]  I don't like his $100,000 alimony.
[00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:25.442]  I'm gonna walk this way.
[00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:27.128]  Don't touch me.
[00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:28.249]  You just hit me, bro.
[00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:29.049]  You put your hand out, Alex.
[00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.770]  Are we gonna do that socialist thing where you like bump into people?
[00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.711]  Alex, I'm walking back.
[00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:36.572]  Hey, Bernie.
[00:09:36.572 --> 00:09:39.853]  Bernie, why are you running, bro?
[00:09:39.853 --> 00:09:40.894]  There we go.
[00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:41.894]  Karl Rove didn't run like this.
[00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:42.775]  He was talking to me.
[00:09:42.775 --> 00:09:43.295]  I'll talk to you.
[00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:46.910]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.471]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:52.373]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:11.017]  You guys are so afraid of stuff.
[00:10:11.017 --> 00:10:15.659]  Wow, Ernie Sanders runs from all shame.
[00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:17.520]  They already got him, you know?
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:17.860]  Don't worry.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.820]  Get my beautiful face on camera.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.661]  Don't worry, we'll destroy America.
[00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:26.183]  We'll turn it into Venezuela.
[00:10:26.183 --> 00:10:31.986]  Don't worry.
[00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:34.447]  Ernie, why'd you say white people don't know what white people are?
[00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:35.027]  Don't touch me.
[00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:36.528]  Alex, don't touch me.
[00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:37.769]  Don't touch me, Alex.
[00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:38.409]  You guys have fun.
[00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:41.944]  Gotta be around the general public, huh?
[00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:43.146]  It's kind of a bad thing?
[00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.668]  You're on the proletariat like that?
[00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:47.009]  You're ruling class commie?
[00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:47.950]  Huh?
[00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.954]  You guys having fun?
[00:10:51.954 --> 00:10:54.277]  We're having fun.
[00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:57.480]  We're all having fun, aren't we?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.821]  We're gonna win, don't worry.
[00:10:58.821 --> 00:10:59.562]  Merrick's coming back.
[00:10:59.562 --> 00:11:00.363]  Merrick's coming back.
[00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:07.023]  Have a good one.
[00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:11.145]  The truth is the left is the most vicious, evil ideology the planet's ever seen.
[00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:12.385]  It's a historical fact.
[00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:14.646]  They always lecture us how we're violent, we're bad.
[00:11:14.646 --> 00:11:16.226]  They're the ones that want to abort all the babies.
[00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:23.789]  They're the ones that wanted to block Trump being able to have all the experimental cures and treatments given to people that were terminal.
[00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:25.369]  They're the people that love the culture of death.
[00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:28.050]  Just like Bernie supported Black Lives Matter.
[00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.031]  Just like he wouldn't decry the cop killers when they killed cops.
[00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:33.112]  That's the type of monster
[00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:36.013]  A cold-blooded person that Sanders is.
[00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:38.874]  He wants to overthrow this country via conquest.
[00:11:38.874 --> 00:11:45.756]  Bernie Sanders is a monster.
[00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:49.297]  Mr. Sanders, why do you think socialism works better than capitalism?
[00:11:49.297 --> 00:11:50.918]  And why do you live in a capitalist country?
[00:11:55.287 --> 00:11:55.927]  Where are you flying today?
[00:11:55.927 --> 00:11:58.790]  You're going to apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex?
[00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.351]  Well, that's the media misrepresents that.
[00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:00.771]  That's that.
[00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:03.093]  You apologize for all the wars you guys launched, the Democrats?
[00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:07.195]  All the millions you killed?
[00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:10.458]  Do you enjoy living in your million-dollar vacation houses, Bernie?
[00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:17.663]  Or do you want to give those to people?
[00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:18.043]  Yeah, your $100,000 Audis?
[00:12:18.043 --> 00:12:19.544]  Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[00:12:19.544 --> 00:12:20.265]  You guys have fun.
[00:12:25.197 --> 00:12:26.458]  You guys are running a little PR stuff.
[00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.381]  It's not going to work.
[00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.485]  Have fun, you know.
[00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:36.267]  Good luck when Google gets broken up.
[00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:38.169]  Apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex.
[00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:38.690]  You guys need to.
[00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.711]  Right?
[00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:41.773]  You made those places victimless armament zones.
[00:12:41.773 --> 00:12:42.653]  And advertised them.
[00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:47.464]  What do you think about the fact that 98% of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones, Bernie?
[00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:49.727]  Do you want to get rid of those?
[00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:52.289]  Why'd you stop being an idiot for a second?
[00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:52.809]  It's okay.
[00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:53.930]  I know it's okay.
[00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.672]  Are you mad Hillary stole the election from him?
[00:12:55.672 --> 00:12:57.694]  I'm mad you're a Sandy Hook denier.
[00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.215]  That's all, you guys are religion.
[00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:00.696]  You think that's like some big... Who's my guy?
[00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:01.317]  Who's my guy?
[00:13:01.317 --> 00:13:01.857]  What guy am I?
[00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:02.638]  I mean, you like Hillary.
[00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:03.659]  What guy am I?
[00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:04.600]  No, you like Hillary.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.701]  Did I bring up Hillary?
[00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:05.941]  No, I didn't.
[00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:12.443]  You deny Sandy Hook and you're giving him a hard time?
[00:13:12.443 --> 00:13:14.504]  No, Hillary edited tapes of that.
[00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:16.866]  Oh, Hillary edited tapes of Sandy Hook?
[00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:17.787]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:17.787 --> 00:13:18.988]  You're an idiot.
[00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:19.548]  You win.
[00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:22.310]  Why don't you talk about all the wars and stuff that's killed millions of people?
[00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.514]  Or Hillary launching the whole thing in Libya and destabilizing the whole country instead of feeling good about yourself?
[00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:29.677]  God, you're a virtue signaler.
[00:13:29.677 --> 00:13:32.000]  Yeah, so... What about the troops that died there?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.222]  Do you know how Benghazi Hillary ordered to stand down?
[00:13:34.222 --> 00:13:37.165]  Anyway, it looks like millions to come.
[00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:42.510]  You guys are losing worlds awake to socialism and all the so-called elite intelligentsia that runs it.
[00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.911]  They're totally awake to it.
[00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:44.272]  Oh, yeah.
[00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:47.075]  And get what's going on with everybody.
[00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:48.316]  Just showing that that's who you are.
[00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:51.364]  Anyways, I gotta go catch my flight.
[00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:53.505]  You guys have a great day.
[00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:54.045]  Please.
[00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:55.025]  One less idiot in L.A.
[00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:55.926]  is good.
[00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:58.026]  Well, L.A.'
[00:13:58.006 --> 00:13:59.366]  's gotta hit their idiot max.
[00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:02.267]  I'm not sure of one of them.
[00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:08.969]  Hey Bernie, why'd you say white people don't know what it's like to be poor?
[00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:10.489]  Why are you so racist?
[00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:13.290]  I won't answer that, but he did say it.
[00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:16.000]  Move to Venezuela, Bernie.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.860]  You'll like it.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.481]  People like you there.
[00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:26.985]  So over and over again, they want to change the subject from communism and socialism destroying hundreds of countries and killing over 200 million people.
[00:14:26.985 --> 00:14:34.088]  They want to change the subject to myself and others asking questions about big public events that are used to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:14:34.088 --> 00:14:35.168]  This is incredible.
[00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:38.490]  But as long as they can't guilt you into their mind control, they fail.
[00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.231]  They are sociopaths and psychopaths.
[00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:45.316]  Leftists and globalists are there to manipulate those of us that have feelings.
[00:14:45.316 --> 00:14:53.464]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, Bernie Sanders checked off the bucket list, running like a cowardly rat into a sewer away from serious questions.
[00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:58.449]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:00.692]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:03.138]  There he is.
[00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:07.983]  Bernie Sanders confronted by Alex Jones at LA International.
[00:15:07.983 --> 00:15:12.928]  And I'm sure we'll be hearing from Alex Jones again today before the broadcast is over.
[00:15:12.928 --> 00:15:16.211]  Now I have people asking me, when are the specials going to end?
[00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:17.592]  I need to take advantage.

[00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:52.914]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:18:29.053 --> 00:18:29.253]  Woo!
[00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:30.294]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:30.294 --> 00:18:39.039]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:48.625]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:52.067]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:57.030]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.092]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:00.092 --> 00:19:03.694]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:05.475]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:17.623]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:22.547]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:26.690]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:32.654]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:19:32.654 --> 00:19:37.758]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:19:37.758 --> 00:19:40.380]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.101]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:46.905]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.187]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:25.830]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.812]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:32.094]  This is the Alex Jones Show, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:36.096]  I'm Owen Schroer, and... Okay.
[00:20:36.096 --> 00:20:45.140]  I've got a bunch of news that I need to cover during the three hours that I'm here, before Paul Joseph Watson takes over in the fourth hour.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.001]  What you can expect...
[00:20:46.932 --> 00:21:09.136]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to join me in the second hour at 12.06, and I'm sure we'll be discussing the latest when it comes to the Russian collusion claim, where now you've got the Mueller team and prosecutors saying that Paul Manafort needs to be put in jail for tampering with witnesses.
[00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:13.757]  Now, this is a razor's edge
[00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:28.140]  That this Russian collusion Mueller probe is now walking on where they are essentially threatening to jail Manafort.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.762]  They're putting that idea out there that maybe we'll jail you.
[00:21:32.762 --> 00:21:40.607]  Thinking, I suppose, that they can still try to quote-unquote flip him on Trump, even though there's nothing to flip, and they know that.
[00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:49.525]  But who knows, maybe there's something from eons ago that Trump did to, I don't know, not pay a tax or something.
[00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:50.146]  I mean, who knows?
[00:21:50.146 --> 00:21:51.786]  Some crazy something like that.
[00:21:51.786 --> 00:21:53.386]  But probably that's not even going to happen.
[00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:56.147]  That's not even the case.
[00:21:56.147 --> 00:22:02.828]  But why are they saying Manafort attempted to tamper with witnesses?
[00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:10.510]  Well, the same principle that you apply to everything going on via the Mueller probe right now applies here.
[00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:15.054]  They are tampering with witnesses.
[00:22:15.054 --> 00:22:19.197]  The Mueller team is tampering with witnesses.
[00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:34.811]  The Deep State that launched this spy operation into Trump's campaign, which we're now dating back to as soon as April, I think it's April 2015, I'd have to review those documents one more time, but it's all coming out now.
[00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.474]  And then Chuck Ross has the story in the Daily Caller.
[00:22:39.474 --> 00:22:45.059]  Papadopoulos' wife, Trump aide, was absolutely not involved in Russian collusion.
[00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:47.882]  It goes through the whole story.
[00:22:47.882 --> 00:22:56.009]  Papadopoulos gets set up at a meeting with some misfud.
[00:22:56.009 --> 00:23:00.814]  A conversation goes down where they're discussing
[00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:10.412]  Hillary's emails where Misfud says that he believes that the Russians have the Hillary emails.
[00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:13.274]  Then Papadopoulos is at another meeting.
[00:23:13.274 --> 00:23:20.518]  Hey, pull that story back up because I forgot the guy's name and I didn't print the other pages of this story.
[00:23:20.518 --> 00:23:24.640]  Then, Papadopoulos, again, having a conversation at a bar.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.601]  Were there drinks?
[00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:26.021]  I don't know.
[00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:26.542]  Does it matter?
[00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.436]  And he's talking to some, not Ms.
[00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:51.938]  Fudd, go down, he's talking to the guy from Australia, who's an Australian-British intelligence officer, and he tells them that he's heard that the Russians have Hillary emails, and then that Australian tells his, I shouldn't say handlers, but shall we say connections, informants, there he is, Downer, Alexander Downer,
[00:23:53.482 --> 00:23:55.363]  Australia's High Commissioner to the UK.
[00:23:55.363 --> 00:24:06.990]  He goes back and tells British intelligence, hey, this guy's claiming the Russians have compromising information on Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:17.416]  Then he goes downer and tells US intelligence, hey, this guy from Trump's campaign claims that the Russians have Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:18.936]  Well, he heard that from Ms.
[00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.257]  Fudd.
[00:24:20.257 --> 00:24:21.338]  That's not even his own
[00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:28.972]  Proprietary thought or idea or information.
[00:24:28.972 --> 00:24:30.233]  And now it gets to the U.S.
[00:24:30.233 --> 00:24:31.734]  intelligence.
[00:24:31.734 --> 00:24:34.156]  And so what do they end up doing?
[00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:48.868]  Well now we've got new documents with the redacted Peter Stroke texts that we now know as far back as July 2015, which is when Stefan Halpert was getting paid and entered the payroll.
[00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:53.372]  The informant, the spy who was working with James Comey.
[00:24:54.815 --> 00:25:04.221]  And then you find out that that is also when they launched their spy operation into Trump's campaign.
[00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:09.083]  Now, that's a story from a while ago that the crew just pulled up.
[00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:10.464]  White House is running this.
[00:25:10.464 --> 00:25:13.166]  Yeah, Obama wanted oversight of the whole thing.
[00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:19.870]  New redacted text have other, I'd have to pull it up, but they have different
[00:25:20.876 --> 00:25:22.077]  Phrases and words in there.
[00:25:22.077 --> 00:25:23.177]  They were basically using spies.
[00:25:23.177 --> 00:25:24.678]  I think it's on kill us spies.
[00:25:24.678 --> 00:25:42.727]  I forget what the I forget what the The letters are but they say lures and It used to be redacted lures, but now lures is out there and that's spies so they were basically putting in foreign intelligence operatives and
[00:25:45.504 --> 00:26:04.797]  Out for Papadopoulos to talk to as lures or spies to then get the fake intel that the Russians had Hillary emails, which then makes it back to the United States that the Russians have compromising information on Hillary, which then somehow magically transforms into we must spy on the Trump campaign.
[00:26:06.328 --> 00:26:07.629]  And we've got all the documents.
[00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:09.390]  We've got the redacted texts.
[00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.712]  We have the FISA documents.
[00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:12.492]  We've got it all.
[00:26:12.492 --> 00:26:14.874]  Obama's caught red-handed.
[00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:17.555]  Comey's caught red-handed.
[00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:21.598]  The entire intelligence community is caught red-handed.
[00:26:21.598 --> 00:26:24.420]  McCabe is caught red-handed.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.481]  The list goes on and on and on.
[00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:36.595]  So why then are they threatening to jail Manafort for tampering with witnesses?
[00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:39.778]  Because they tampered with witnesses.
[00:26:39.778 --> 00:26:42.941]  They are the ones that were tampering with Papadopoulos.
[00:26:42.941 --> 00:26:46.444]  They are the ones that have been tampering with this quote-unquote
[00:26:48.058 --> 00:26:54.120]  Russian probe, since the very outset, where they're spying on the Trump campaign as early as July 2015.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.381]  Here we are, June 2018.
[00:26:57.381 --> 00:27:00.242]  How much evidence of Russian collusion do they have?
[00:27:00.242 --> 00:27:02.182]  Zero.
[00:27:02.182 --> 00:27:06.643]  But what is the ultimate irony?
[00:27:06.643 --> 00:27:14.486]  The Trump campaign seems to believe that the Russians have compromising information on Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.226]  What would that be?
[00:27:16.752 --> 00:27:23.135]  Could it be the emails that Hillary Clinton deleted from her illegal server?
[00:27:23.135 --> 00:27:29.479]  Could it be the information that she bleach bit from her illegal servers?
[00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:37.323]  Could it be the information and data that was on the servers that were literally smashed by a hammer?
[00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:38.724]  No.
[00:27:38.724 --> 00:27:41.525]  Actually, there's an element of truth to this.
[00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:43.947]  For you see, the Russians did
[00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:47.956]  have compromising information on Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:47.956 --> 00:27:53.799]  It's called Uranium One.
[00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:56.020]  Amazing.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:06.605]  So here the Russians are, making deals with Hillary Clinton, Uranium One, actual dirt on Hillary Clinton, somehow gets spun,
[00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:23.161]  Into the Russians have Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, which is only a story because Hillary Clinton broke the law to begin with, and so now, to bring it home, former U.S.
[00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:28.085]  Navy Christian Saucier is suing Obama and Comey
[00:28:29.315 --> 00:28:50.887]  For selectively prosecuting him in the case of mishandling classified information, where he was charged, Hillary Clinton, guilty of the same thing, gets no jail time, gets nothing, gets an extra special back brace so that a spineless fraud and thief like Hillary Clinton can still walk around and give speeches.
[00:28:50.887 --> 00:28:57.271]  So, Mueller's team tampered with witnesses, Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians, and it's all blowing up in their face.
[00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:02.747]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[00:29:02.747 --> 00:29:05.568]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[00:29:05.568 --> 00:29:07.468]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[00:29:07.468 --> 00:29:12.530]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.811]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:22.093]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[00:29:37.286 --> 00:29:41.711]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[00:30:06.114 --> 00:30:06.995]  It'd take hours.

[00:30:12.217 --> 00:30:15.439]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.482]  I don't know.

[00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.035 --> 00:33:20.356]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:20.356 --> 00:33:25.017]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.017 --> 00:33:29.719]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:39.461]  I wasn't intending to go on that rabbit trail in the last segment with Manafort and the Mueller probe and Papadopoulos, but we got that out of the way.
[00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:46.890]  But there's all kinds of other news, and I really wanted to get back into that with Dr. Corsi, who's going to join me at 12.06.
[00:33:46.890 --> 00:34:03.433]  In similar news, though, we mentioned Saussure suing Obama and Comey for sparring Hillary Clinton and prosecuting him for the exact same crimes.
[00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:08.494]  Oh, but Obama was the scandal-free president, so this story must be fake news.
[00:34:08.494 --> 00:34:09.734]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:12.444]  Obama's scandal-free!
[00:34:12.444 --> 00:34:16.231]  Come on, man!
[00:34:16.231 --> 00:34:19.598]  Oh, you know, I think we've got a news crew doing a man on the street.
[00:34:21.966 --> 00:34:22.626]  Right now.
[00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:25.789]  That is going to be asking people a certain question about Obama.
[00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:28.050]  I wonder if they'll be able to answer it.
[00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.871]  Looking forward to that!
[00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:36.816]  In similar news, Imran Awan allegedly tried to hide his money while DOJ negotiates with him.
[00:34:36.816 --> 00:34:42.760]  Former Democrat IT staffer Imran Awan allegedly tried to hide his money.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.983]  Awan's lawyer claims his client does not have a pot to piss in.
[00:34:48.888 --> 00:34:55.390]  Alon is currently under FBI investigation over unauthorized access house servers and is indicted on charges of bank fraud.
[00:34:55.390 --> 00:35:05.333]  Of course he had all sorts of phony businesses that his brothers were running and probably laundering money out of.
[00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:07.733]  That's where the bank fraud comes from.
[00:35:07.733 --> 00:35:14.055]  Getting paid millions and millions of dollars by the Democrat Party for this IT work.
[00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:18.783]  Now they're trying to hide this money and his lawyer's claiming he's broke.
[00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.444]  Well, where'd all that money go then, bro?
[00:35:21.444 --> 00:35:24.406]  You and your brothers made millions.
[00:35:24.406 --> 00:35:28.108]  And what did the Democrats know about the Iwans, I wonder?
[00:35:28.108 --> 00:35:32.711]  If they knew anything about the Iwans, they wouldn't have hired them.
[00:35:32.711 --> 00:35:38.374]  Unless, of course, they were engaging in something other than politics.
[00:35:38.374 --> 00:35:40.376]  Hmm.
[00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:45.659]  Maybe they're paying the Iwans this exorbitant amount of cash because they want it laundered.
[00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:45.799]  Hmm.
[00:35:46.257 --> 00:35:47.097]  I don't know.
[00:35:47.097 --> 00:35:51.220]  Maybe that's why this comes from Luke Rosiak at the Daily Caller.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:59.925]  Debbie Washerman Schultz screamed at House officials to kill hacking probe, intervened in Pakistani criminal manner.
[00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:10.451]  Well, this is Debbie Washerman Schultz freaking out right now because she knows she's caught guilty dead to rights.
[00:36:12.878 --> 00:36:18.619]  But I'm gonna get into both of those stories with Dr. Corsi in the next hour.
[00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:25.060]  And in the meantime, I'm gonna cover some of this other news to just get it out of the way.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.181]  This is a heartbreaker here.
[00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:39.063]  Amber Alert issued in Virginia, North Carolina, after police say registered sex offender snatched seven-month-old baby.
[00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:44.827]  And they believe that this baby is in immediate and serious danger.
[00:36:44.827 --> 00:36:45.947]  Mm-mm-mm.
[00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:50.969]  You have to... Boy.
[00:36:50.969 --> 00:36:54.851]  Seven-month-old baby kidnapped by a registered sex offender.
[00:36:54.851 --> 00:36:57.012]  Now, there may be some other ripples to this story.
[00:36:57.012 --> 00:36:59.873]  We'll see if anybody wants to cover it.
[00:36:59.873 --> 00:37:06.236]  But... It's really just sick that people are that sick.
[00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:10.371]  I think really is what that comes down to.
[00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:13.514]  Boy, where do you go from there?
[00:37:13.514 --> 00:37:19.779]  Okay, well, Paul Joseph Watson has a story that got linked on Drudge today.
[00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:24.022]  Bilderberg globalists concerned about populist uprising in Europe.
[00:37:24.022 --> 00:37:31.949]  So, amongst the topics of discussion at the Bilderberg group, you have populism in Europe, they can't stand that, they want communism.
[00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:34.495]  They have the U.S.
[00:37:34.495 --> 00:37:35.616]  midterm elections.
[00:37:35.616 --> 00:37:38.077]  They have the post-truth world.
[00:37:38.077 --> 00:37:41.080]  The post-truth world.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.461]  The post-truth world.
[00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:46.043]  Oh my gosh!
[00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:52.508]  Do you realize how much truth has been kept from the general public?
[00:37:52.508 --> 00:38:02.195]  I mean, unless you have a good history teacher coming up in American schools, you won't know jack crap about human history.
[00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:14.126]  A good history teacher in the United States doesn't even go from the textbook because they know that about half of it's BS.
[00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:29.598]  But, oh, oh, see, now that we're actually entering a world where truth media is gaining footing, now that we're entering a world where the President of the United States just says things like it is, now it's a post-truth world.
[00:38:32.898 --> 00:38:35.380]  No, it's been a post-truth world.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.102]  We're entering the post-post-truth world.
[00:38:39.102 --> 00:38:40.123]  That's what this really is.
[00:38:40.123 --> 00:38:48.189]  So the Bilderberg Group is going to be addressing how to deal with the post-post-truth world.
[00:38:48.189 --> 00:38:51.291]  Or the truth world.
[00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:52.632]  Yeah, there's the Washington Post.
[00:38:52.632 --> 00:38:56.195]  Welcome to the post-truth presidency.
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:58.076]  Oh, yes.
[00:38:58.076 --> 00:38:59.077]  Not Obama, though.
[00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:01.440]  Not Obama.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.180]  What, does Trump have a magic wand?
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.741]  Economy records.
[00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:07.722]  Oh, I set Trump up for that economy.
[00:39:07.722 --> 00:39:09.683]  No, no, no, no, that was the truth, President.
[00:39:09.683 --> 00:39:10.544]  You want that doctor?
[00:39:10.544 --> 00:39:11.644]  You keep that doctor.
[00:39:11.644 --> 00:39:13.265]  No, you can't keep that doctor.
[00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:14.586]  You love your health care plan?
[00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:15.846]  You keep that health care plan.
[00:39:15.846 --> 00:39:17.627]  Sorry, sorry, you don't have that health care plan.
[00:39:17.627 --> 00:39:19.948]  That's not your health care plan.
[00:39:19.948 --> 00:39:20.849]  You built a business?
[00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:22.589]  You didn't build that business!
[00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:23.650]  I built that business!
[00:39:26.704 --> 00:39:30.606]  So that's not the post-truth president, it's Trump, who's the truth president.
[00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:34.668]  So again, Trump is the post-post-truth president.
[00:39:34.668 --> 00:39:37.029]  Obama is the post-truth president.
[00:39:37.029 --> 00:39:39.070]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:48.675]  And the Bilderberg Group is going to be meeting in Italy, which is right where a nationalist uprising is going on in the face of the EU right now.
[00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:52.456]  So, Paul Joseph Watson's story is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:54.764 --> 00:40:19.148]  Now the New York Times, like everyone else, is having to admit that Trump knew what he was doing with the North Korean trade deal, really just bamboozled the media and bamboozled the Democrats, who ended up siding with North Korea, praising the North Korean propaganda head, Kim Jong-un's sister,
[00:40:20.956 --> 00:40:30.385]  But the story from the New York Times is shocking, because you read the story, the headline is, China's trade war with North Korea is set to soar.
[00:40:30.385 --> 00:40:34.688]  China's trade with North Korea is set to soar with a Trump-Kim deal.
[00:40:34.688 --> 00:40:37.971]  So yeah, North Korea's gonna benefit.
[00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:46.219]  Now they're gonna have to do deals with China, not just sideways deals that China's been taking advantage of North Korea on, just basically keeping the power on over there.
[00:40:48.703 --> 00:40:55.788]  And then you read the story and it's all about how now in North Korea they're going to have a middle class.
[00:40:55.788 --> 00:40:57.850]  And it's like there's a burgeoning middle class.
[00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.771]  North Korea looks to have a middle class.
[00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:09.339]  The new coming trade and the Trump-Kim deal is going to basically create a North Korean economy where you can have a middle class.
[00:41:12.481 --> 00:41:17.402]  But he's the post-truth president, okay?
[00:41:17.402 --> 00:41:20.783]  So he's not the post-communist president.
[00:41:20.783 --> 00:41:23.024]  He's not the post-Korean War president.
[00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:24.384]  He's the post-truth president.
[00:41:24.384 --> 00:41:26.925]  I saw it on the same New York Times.
[00:41:26.925 --> 00:41:34.387]  It actually printed that story, admitting that he's probably saving North Korea and creating a middle class there.
[00:41:34.387 --> 00:41:37.968]  Here's Trump this morning meeting in Singapore with North Korea.
[00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:38.688]  Go back to that, guys.
[00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:47.051]  Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big we will soon see.
[00:41:47.051 --> 00:41:48.573]  That was President Trump this morning.
[00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:54.219]  Of course, Kim Jong-un has to have someone pay for his hotel room because that's the dire straits North Korea is in.
[00:41:57.287 --> 00:42:03.231]  I want to explain another story that you're probably seeing here with a little bit more detail.
[00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:07.094]  Trump taunts NFL players after nixing Eagles White House visit.
[00:42:07.094 --> 00:42:17.061]  Well, first of all, the quote-unquote taunt to me was more of just a joke, but there were only going to be 10 Eagles that showed up.
[00:42:18.345 --> 00:42:20.046]  So of course he wants to cancel it.
[00:42:20.046 --> 00:42:21.287]  Only 10 Eagles are going to show up.
[00:42:21.287 --> 00:42:23.308]  I'm sorry, he's got better things to do.
[00:42:23.308 --> 00:42:24.989]  That's how he looks at this.
[00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:29.572]  And as far as the taunt is concerned, it was more of a joke.
[00:42:29.572 --> 00:42:41.580]  And if you don't see the connection with this story, Vince McMahon taps Andrew Luck's dad to be XFL's new commissioner, you don't understand how Trump works.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.442]  The timing here is perfect.
[00:42:44.352 --> 00:42:51.579]  Put Vince McMahon and his competition league with the NFL back in the headlines to put more pressure on the NFL.
[00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:53.101]  This is the art of the deal.
[00:42:53.101 --> 00:42:54.422]  This is what Trump does.
[00:42:54.422 --> 00:42:56.705]  He has more friends and is more popular than the globalists.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.385]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:06.670]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.938]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.938 --> 00:43:15.722]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:20.247]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:26.734]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.734 --> 00:43:31.699]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:36.363]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:43.567]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:48.270]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:54.473]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.473 --> 00:43:58.456]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.383 --> 00:44:06.310]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:15.098]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.

[00:45:01.089 --> 00:45:05.652]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:05.652 --> 00:45:06.233]  Thanks for holding.
[00:45:06.233 --> 00:45:07.654]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:45:07.654 --> 00:45:11.277]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:20.003]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:36.276]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:45:36.796 --> 00:45:45.403]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:45:45.403 --> 00:45:50.287]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:45:50.287 --> 00:45:55.551]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[00:46:04.483 --> 00:46:10.207]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:18.092]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:21.254]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:26.698]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:46:26.698 --> 00:46:29.480]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:38.447]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:46:38.627 --> 00:46:40.008]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:10.101 --> 00:47:13.624]  Implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line.
[00:47:13.624 --> 00:47:16.666]  Take your destiny in your hands and don't let these people control your future.
[00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:18.588]  Initialize my modem.
[00:47:18.588 --> 00:47:20.369]  I've got one that can see.
[00:47:23.321 --> 00:47:26.042]  Oh wow!
[00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.531]  Do not do it!
[00:48:10.531 --> 00:48:14.334]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:48:16.314 --> 00:48:34.588]  Well, we've hit an interesting nexus point here with humanity and the technology we use, and the merging of the two, where it's becoming more and more a part of not just our daily routine, but of us.
[00:48:34.588 --> 00:48:41.673]  Literally becoming almost part of us, where the endgame is, of course, to merge with machines.
[00:48:43.223 --> 00:48:48.107]  Will we be forced to merge with machines because the environment we will create?
[00:48:48.107 --> 00:49:01.359]  Will we volunteer to merge with machines because it's going to be trendy and liberal and who doesn't want to have the best eyesight in the world or whatever the case may be, sonar, who knows what they'll do?
[00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:09.867]  But the nexus point we've reached is we're now recognizing what the technology is doing to us.
[00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:30.424]  We're now realizing how we're becoming slaves to the technology, and we're not just learning about the psychological side effects, but also the physical side effects, where the 5G rollout could, I mean, seriously, who knows the devastating effects of the 5G rollout?
[00:49:30.424 --> 00:49:33.945]  The 6G will be game over.
[00:49:33.945 --> 00:49:37.467]  But we're kind of realizing all of this now.
[00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:39.028]  The tech companies knew it the whole time.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.482]  There have been studies released that indicated this.
[00:49:42.482 --> 00:49:45.784]  Now they're just coming out with the real studies that they knew the whole time.
[00:49:45.784 --> 00:49:48.326]  The 5G causing cancer.
[00:49:48.326 --> 00:49:51.628]  The light patterns.
[00:49:51.628 --> 00:49:55.571]  Manipulating your brain waves.
[00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:56.551]  I mean, it's all out there.
[00:49:56.551 --> 00:50:01.755]  The crew is just going through all the stories right now.
[00:50:01.755 --> 00:50:02.936]  So I'm going to get into this here.
[00:50:04.676 --> 00:50:08.339]  But first, you've got this story from Michael Snyder.
[00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:16.005]  The Department of Homeland Security plans to compile a list of all bloggers, journalists, and social media influencers.
[00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:25.453]  Now, it's kind of a no-duh situation, but Michael Snyder breaks it all down in the story on his website, endoftheamericandream.com.
[00:50:25.453 --> 00:50:29.216]  But I just want to say this.
[00:50:29.216 --> 00:50:30.798]  Drudge links to this story
[00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:39.159]  But links to the Zero Hedge link to the story.
[00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:51.707]  So the story, the link, goes to Zero Hedge on Drudge instead of End of the American Dream, where I just say, Matt Drudge, we need you to give Michael Snyder fair attention here.
[00:50:51.707 --> 00:50:53.067]  You know, he's running for Congress.
[00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:58.085]  So there's the link that Drudge links to on Zero Hedge.
[00:50:58.085 --> 00:51:10.029]  I really wish Drudge would have linked to the original post on the American Dream, EndOfTheAmericanDream.com by Michael Snyder, because Michael Snyder's running for Congress and he needs more attention.
[00:51:10.029 --> 00:51:14.990]  So not sure if Drudge even was aware of that or if it was him, but just wanted to point that out.
[00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.431]  But it all comes back to the same thing.
[00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:17.271]  So now we know
[00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:37.129]  Whatever you say and do in the digital world, probably being tracked, probably being spied on, maybe not by human intelligence, but at least by artificial intelligence in some respects, and stuff you do on social media is pretty much out there for anyone to discover or even steal.
[00:51:37.129 --> 00:51:37.570]  For example,
[00:51:41.445 --> 00:51:44.066]  Look, I have certain shortcomings when it comes to this stuff.
[00:51:44.066 --> 00:51:53.690]  I think I'm probably on the better end of things where I don't really get on social media much, but it's really not that complex.
[00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.631]  You don't have to be a genius to figure this out.
[00:51:56.631 --> 00:52:06.174]  When you sign up for a Twitter account or a Facebook account or what have you, your information goes into their databases.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:21.448]  You don't think that a radical within Facebook or Twitter or who knows what may be motivated to get access to your private information and share that with others?
[00:52:21.448 --> 00:52:23.209]  So people are starting to realize this.
[00:52:24.653 --> 00:52:26.974]  Here's the story from Science Daily.
[00:52:26.974 --> 00:52:31.736]  Adolescents vulnerable to insomnia, depression from prolonged screen time.
[00:52:31.736 --> 00:52:35.918]  That's just one of dozens of studies about that, the depression, everything.
[00:52:35.918 --> 00:52:41.460]  And now even Apple is unveiling ways to help limit iPhone usage.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:52.765]  Of course, we knew about how Steve Jobs didn't let his children use iPads, how Tim Cook I don't think lets his kids use iPads either.
[00:52:52.765 --> 00:52:53.966]  So Apple now comes out.
[00:52:55.467 --> 00:53:01.832]  With their support plan for phone addiction.
[00:53:01.832 --> 00:53:04.414]  So guys, let's go first to clip 7.
[00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:09.477]  This is Apple's new support for phone addiction.
[00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:15.342]  Screen time empowers you with both insight and control over how you spend your time.
[00:53:17.259 --> 00:53:21.720]  Apple is facing criticism about our increasingly unhealthy dependence on iPhones.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.161]  The company responded Monday with an iOS feature to help us monitor and limit our usage.
[00:53:25.161 --> 00:53:27.581]  It starts with reports.
[00:53:27.581 --> 00:53:35.983]  Every week, you get a weekly activity summary that details how you used your iPhone or iPad.
[00:53:35.983 --> 00:53:40.404]  You tap in, and you get to view your full activity report.
[00:53:40.404 --> 00:53:41.365]  It's really detailed.
[00:53:41.365 --> 00:53:46.646]  You get deep insight on how much time you're spending, where you're spending it, and even how you're using it.
[00:53:48.712 --> 00:53:52.640]  Apple and Google have already been doing that to you.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.707]  They're just showing you what they've been doing to you for years.
[00:53:55.707 --> 00:53:56.428]  Oh, you love it.
[00:53:56.428 --> 00:53:56.789]  Go back.
[00:53:57.503 --> 00:53:59.805]  Yeah, you can't just turn off notifications.
[00:54:26.906 --> 00:54:30.087]  Put your phone in a different room?
[00:54:30.087 --> 00:54:31.987]  What?
[00:54:31.987 --> 00:54:35.288]  Actually, I did this social experiment.
[00:54:35.288 --> 00:54:45.010]  And again, for me, I feel like I have to have my cell phone attached to me in case something comes up here or in the news and I need to report it.
[00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:49.411]  So, maybe I'm a hypocrite, maybe I'm just forced to be that way, but I actually did
[00:54:50.546 --> 00:54:58.191]  and experiment myself where for a couple weeks I left my phone in a different room and I just didn't even have my phone in the room.
[00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:02.674]  I slept so much better, it was very noticeable.
[00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:04.975]  So you can just do that for yourself and find out.
[00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:13.760]  So here's Apple, all the studies, everything coming out, you know, the iPhone, the apps, the smartphones, the screen time, it's messing with us.
[00:55:14.864 --> 00:55:16.885]  The 5G is messing with our DNA.
[00:55:16.885 --> 00:55:19.126]  It's messing with our reproductive systems.
[00:55:19.126 --> 00:55:22.088]  The screen time is messing with our psychology.
[00:55:22.088 --> 00:55:24.629]  Messing with our endorphins.
[00:55:24.629 --> 00:55:25.269]  The whole thing.
[00:55:25.269 --> 00:55:26.850]  It's all going on.
[00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:27.771]  Manipulating us.
[00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:33.760]  Declassified documents show that the CIA can get access to anything on the digital world.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:43.028]  Other mistakenly leaked documents show how the government can use the cell phones to actually manipulate your physical behavior.
[00:55:43.028 --> 00:55:44.450]  So that all comes out.
[00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:51.316]  But listen and look at what ESPN is doing now to market their new app.
[00:55:53.223 --> 00:55:58.607]  Leaving home was one thing, but leaving my sports, I could never do that.
[00:55:58.607 --> 00:55:59.147]  Can't leave my heart.
[00:55:59.147 --> 00:56:03.770]  You have no idea how hard it used to be, until the new ESPN app came along.
[00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:05.372]  We're best mates.
[00:56:05.372 --> 00:56:07.373]  I can take it anywhere.
[00:56:07.373 --> 00:56:09.875]  Now with ESPN+, we stream everything together.
[00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:11.056]  Alright, so just pause it right there.
[00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:30.966]  So just for the radio audience, so he's walking around, he's at a beautiful beach, beautiful scenery, he's out with some friends, playing some bags, you know, he's walking around and he doesn't have any friends but he's got his ESPN app on his smartphone and he can finally live his full life.
[00:56:30.966 --> 00:56:32.607]  Here, rewind it 10 seconds and let's...
[00:56:33.948 --> 00:56:35.268]  This is so beautiful.
[00:56:35.268 --> 00:56:36.249]  Here he is.
[00:56:36.249 --> 00:56:39.390]  Here he is eating breakfast, but he's got his ESPN app.
[00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:40.850]  He's got his sports.
[00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:43.391]  Alright, go forward with it.
[00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:48.232]  Here he is in a beautiful walk by an ocean or sea, but he's staring at his phone.
[00:56:48.232 --> 00:56:50.993]  Here he is with friends, staring at his phone.
[00:56:50.993 --> 00:56:51.093]  Now...
[00:57:00.259 --> 00:57:02.721]  If they were doing that as a joke, I think it would be funny.
[00:57:02.721 --> 00:57:04.262]  That did not seem like a joke.
[00:57:04.262 --> 00:57:05.784]  That seemed like the real deal.
[00:57:05.784 --> 00:57:07.445]  Wow, man.
[00:57:07.445 --> 00:57:12.609]  Your whole life is the ESPN app on a phone, and now that is your life.
[00:57:12.609 --> 00:57:20.876]  When you go out in the real world, you're stuck on your phone looking at the ESPN app.
[00:57:20.876 --> 00:57:23.378]  So, what do we do then?
[00:57:23.378 --> 00:57:24.539]  This is a serious question.
[00:57:24.539 --> 00:57:26.080]  Maybe I should open up the phone lines.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:26.901]  What do we do?
[00:57:28.106 --> 00:57:34.791]  Do we just commit to putting the phones away and readjust?
[00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:45.860]  Or do we just accept the reality for what it is and just continue to go deeper and deeper into this technology dive, so deep that we can never even get back to the surface?
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.581]  We'll be right back with Dr. Corsi.
[00:57:47.581 --> 00:57:48.082]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:57:49.315 --> 00:57:56.939]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:57:56.939 --> 00:58:04.862]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:58:04.862 --> 00:58:07.944]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:58:08.584 --> 00:58:13.229]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:58:13.229 --> 00:58:17.354]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:58:17.354 --> 00:58:20.517]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:58:20.517 --> 00:58:25.282]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:58:25.282 --> 00:58:28.286]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:58:28.726 --> 00:58:43.810]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.330]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.671]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:58:50.134 --> 00:59:08.986]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[00:59:09.306 --> 00:59:10.106]  The revolution.
[00:59:10.106 --> 00:59:12.207]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:59:37.558 --> 00:59:42.963]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:59:42.963 --> 00:59:53.354]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:59:53.354 --> 00:59:55.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.544 --> 01:00:16.607]  Alright, Dr. Jerry Corsi is with me now, and I just want to say this before we bring Dr. Corsi in.
[01:00:16.607 --> 01:00:19.249]  I have decided in the third hour I'm going to open up the phone lines.
[01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.069]  As of right now, it's guest free.
[01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:25.891]  So, in the third hour, we may hear from Alex Jones, but I am going to open up the phone lines.
[01:00:25.891 --> 01:00:28.192]  We may even dip into that in the second hour.
[01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:29.273]  Specifically, though,
[01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:34.558]  What should we do about the smartphones?
[01:00:34.558 --> 01:00:41.503]  What should we do as we are going down the... I kind of like the analogy I said actually last edit.
[01:00:41.503 --> 01:00:45.066]  We're diving deeper and deeper and deeper into this technology.
[01:00:46.616 --> 01:00:51.158]  But are we going to get so deep that we can no longer come back up to the surface?
[01:00:51.158 --> 01:00:52.319]  Is it no longer an option?
[01:00:52.319 --> 01:01:00.724]  Or do we pause now and wonder, hmm, maybe we should go back up to the surface for a minute and reconsider what we've seen so far?
[01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:05.126]  So I'm going to open up the phone lines maybe later in this hour, but definitely in the third hour for that.
[01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:09.188]  But in the meantime, Dr. Jerry Corsi joins me now.
[01:01:09.188 --> 01:01:09.708]  Now, Dr. Corsi,
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:18.870]  There's two developments happening right now domestically that I'd kind of like to get in with you here.
[01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:19.590]  You've got the
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.964]  Mueller prosecutors saying that Manafort should be put in jail for tampering with witnesses.
[01:01:26.964 --> 01:01:28.806]  It's my view that's what they're doing.
[01:01:28.806 --> 01:01:42.175]  You've got them using this Papadopoulos situation as a, shall we say, catalyst to get the spying going on the Trump campaign, which we're now learning may have even dated back to as early as April 2015, certainly July 2015.
[01:01:45.529 --> 01:01:51.891]  What do you think about the Papadopoulos story, where it looks like that was real witness tampering by the Deep State.
[01:01:51.891 --> 01:01:57.313]  But then you've got kind of another wing here that's not going away, but not getting the press attention.
[01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:03.456]  The Imran Awan and the Awan Brothers investigation, where they're hiding money, they're trying to flee the country.
[01:02:03.456 --> 01:02:11.619]  Wasserman Schultz freaks out about the server, threatens the police, now threatening officials, apparently screaming at them, says the Daily Caller.
[01:02:12.639 --> 01:02:18.360]  Just in this short segment, Dr. Corsi, what do you think we need to get into here in the next half hour?
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.521]  Well, I think you're first of all right.
[01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:35.945]  We just got 500 new pages from the Senate of the Swarczyk page text messages, and they made clear that Papadopoulos was an agent of the federal government who wore a wire.
[01:02:35.945 --> 01:02:39.646]  So he was an agent going back to December 2015.
[01:02:41.546 --> 01:02:48.250]  Which is way before James Comey argued that we started the counterintelligence investigation.
[01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:49.831]  Comey said that was in July 2016.
[01:02:49.831 --> 01:03:08.443]  And it appears that we had our FBI agent, Papadopoulos, go to London, talk to more CIA agents, and there's two figures there, Stephen Halper, and the Australian, this guy Downey, or Dowdney,
[01:03:09.478 --> 01:03:21.066]  And so we had a whole bunch of our spies talking to our CIA agents in order to create the story, falsified story, that Trump was colluding with Russia.
[01:03:21.066 --> 01:03:27.931]  It appears to have been an entrapment scheme going back to December 2015, and that's pretty startling.
[01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:30.212]  That's pretty amazing, actually.
[01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:32.214]  And what I find in the other part of this,
[01:03:33.408 --> 01:03:34.450]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:38.396]  That's alright, why don't you hit ignore on that and I'll just take over for a second here.
[01:03:38.396 --> 01:03:46.969]  Yeah, and it's amazing too because again, when you look at the Papadopoulos situation, you mentioned the, I think it was a Downer?
[01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:48.451]  I always forget his name for some reason too.
[01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:56.236]  And you look at how Papadopoulos was kind of thrown around and tossed around there to get the reason to spy.
[01:03:56.236 --> 01:04:01.659]  But then you get the newly redacted 500 texts that show that they were sending spies in.
[01:04:01.659 --> 01:04:04.281]  They admit it in these texts as soon as 2015.
[01:04:04.281 --> 01:04:11.025]  And we find out that Stefan Halpert, who was Comey's spy, Comey's link,
[01:04:11.585 --> 01:04:17.027]  Was reintroduced on the payroll as early as July 2015, of course, a month after Trump announced.
[01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:20.588]  So all the dots are starting to connect here, Dr. Cortsey.
[01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:37.553]  And what it's connecting into is the entrapment scheme of spies and CIA agents that were designed even before Donald Trump was in the primaries to penetrate his campaign and pollute it with his Russian collusion narrative.
[01:04:38.243 --> 01:04:42.728]  This is clearly an entrapment scheme and I'm maintaining a coup d'etat scheme.
[01:04:42.728 --> 01:04:51.037]  And then with the Iwan brothers, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I think, is really in it very, very deep and it needs to be more thoroughly investigated.
[01:04:51.037 --> 01:04:55.562]  Yeah, I'm wondering if she's not freaking out because she knew about that money laundering.
[01:04:55.562 --> 01:04:56.964]  We're going to be right back with Dr. Corsi.
[01:04:58.157 --> 01:05:02.141]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:05:02.141 --> 01:05:04.884]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:05:04.884 --> 01:05:09.688]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:12.111]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[01:05:55.389 --> 01:05:57.311]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:03.499 --> 01:06:06.341]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:12.224]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:17.528]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:17.528 --> 01:06:19.008]  I'll tell ya, it's incredible.
[01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:24.532]  I mean, everything's pretty much incredible when it comes to this Russian collusion probe, but now...
[01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:35.265]  You wonder, how did this happen where the FBI and Clapper admit to spying on the Trump campaign?
[01:06:35.265 --> 01:06:40.250]  You get the declassified texts that admit they were spying on the Trump campaign.
[01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:45.155]  You get the unredacted texts that talk about luring people in with intelligence assets.
[01:06:46.274 --> 01:06:57.737]  You get the documents of Stephen Halper getting rehired onto the FBI in July 2015, a month after Trump announced he was running.
[01:06:57.737 --> 01:07:08.239]  You've got all these foreign intelligence assets like Christopher Steele and Downer with their connections to spreading false information and using that to then get the quote-unquote
[01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:19.324]  Reason to get a FISA warrant to spy on President Trump, which was actually just using paid-for Clinton opposition research, which was fake.
[01:07:19.324 --> 01:07:20.506]  Did the FBI know it?
[01:07:20.506 --> 01:07:21.547]  Did the FISA courts know it?
[01:07:21.547 --> 01:07:22.808]  Did Obama know it?
[01:07:22.808 --> 01:07:25.571]  I would bet yes, but I guess we're still waiting to find that out.
[01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:46.183]  But perhaps the most amazing thing, Dr. Corsi, is what we're seeing now, where even though they're admitting they spied, they've used about six different terms to say spy now, but they have said spy, you know, human resource officer, intelligence officer, you know, whatever, they use all these different terms.
[01:07:46.183 --> 01:07:53.248]  Spying, they were spying on the Trump campaign, they admit it, but Dr. Corsi, somehow, some way,
[01:07:54.412 --> 01:08:01.874]  Vox, New York Times, even though they originally printed the story that they were spying on Trump, they all say there was no spying on Trump!
[01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:03.435]  They're making up fake news!
[01:08:03.435 --> 01:08:04.715]  There was no spying on Trump!
[01:08:04.715 --> 01:08:08.416]  We're like, wait a second, the people that did it just admitted they did it.
[01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:10.517]  Now you're gaslighting me, telling me it didn't happen?
[01:08:10.517 --> 01:08:12.877]  I mean, is that not the most incredible thing?
[01:08:12.877 --> 01:08:14.818]  Where even the people that spied
[01:08:15.678 --> 01:08:17.099]  Have admitted they spied.
[01:08:17.099 --> 01:08:18.700]  We have the declassified documents.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.402]  We have the unredacted text.
[01:08:20.402 --> 01:08:21.803]  We know they spied.
[01:08:21.803 --> 01:08:24.905]  And you still have news outlets that are claiming that it never happened.
[01:08:24.905 --> 01:08:26.166]  You're fake news for saying it?
[01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:32.210]  I mean, if this isn't 1984 level, I don't know what is, Dr. Corsi.
[01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.352]  Well, I think, Owen, you pegged it.
[01:08:34.352 --> 01:08:36.133]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:08:36.133 --> 01:08:38.515]  And what I think most people don't appreciate
[01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:49.353]  Is that we're at the end, I think, of the first phase, which I've always typified as the attempt to get Donald Trump impeached.
[01:08:49.353 --> 01:08:51.634]  And this is a, this is a failed effort now.
[01:08:51.634 --> 01:09:00.196]  And I see all the signs with Giuliani saying, you know, first of all, Donald Trump tweeting out that he could pardon himself, which by the way, he could.
[01:09:00.196 --> 01:09:07.138]  The only, the only, first of all, I don't even know why that became a story, but just to clarify, the only thing Trump couldn't pardon himself on is impeachment, which they don't have.
[01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:14.650]  Well, but see, and the point of that was to say, to taunt to Mueller and say, go ahead and impeach me.
[01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.873]  If you got it, bring it.
[01:09:17.873 --> 01:09:23.738]  And then Giuliani is basically saying the same thing, saying, I don't know if we'll testify, interview, subpoena us.
[01:09:23.738 --> 01:09:26.021]  We'll take it to the Supreme Court.
[01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:29.644]  Now, these are calling Mueller's bluff.
[01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:36.573]  And this is the end game here of the impeachment attempt because Trump has decided to go ahead and play hardball.
[01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.034]  He's going to call the bluff.
[01:09:38.034 --> 01:09:39.174]  Show me your cards, Mueller.
[01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.295]  What do you got?
[01:09:40.295 --> 01:09:42.216]  You want to go to the Supreme Court subpoenaing me?
[01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:42.556]  Fine.
[01:09:43.778 --> 01:09:44.939]  You want to impeach me?
[01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:45.820]  Fine.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:51.886]  Otherwise, you've got nothing, and I can pardon myself and walk free and end your whole deal tomorrow.
[01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:57.051]  Now, Trump won't pardon himself, again, for political reasons.
[01:09:57.051 --> 01:10:06.060]  But the point is, the messages have been communicated and received by Mueller, and now Mueller's bluff has been called, and it's up to Mueller to see what he wants to do.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.243]  And I think Trump will be happy to go to the Supreme Court.
[01:10:09.243 --> 01:10:10.784]  I think Trump will win at the Supreme Court.
[01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:26.498]  Well it's my understanding too that the only reason this story of Trump pardoning himself really became a story was because you had the Clinton operative George Stephan, all of us, George Stephanopoulos, who literally started in media as a Clinton operative, huge Clinton supporter,
[01:10:27.279 --> 01:10:34.084]  He has an interview with Giuliani where he's basically just forcing the question, just forcing the issue, like, would he pardon himself?
[01:10:34.084 --> 01:10:35.165]  Could he pardon himself?
[01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:36.345]  Will he pardon himself?
[01:10:36.345 --> 01:10:39.908]  Just forcing it, and then you know how it goes, and then it becomes a media story.
[01:10:39.908 --> 01:10:42.730]  So this is how the operatives work.
[01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:49.875]  Step on all of us, George, step on all of us at ABC, bores into Giuliani, forces home the question of, would he pardon himself?
[01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:55.339]  Then it becomes a big headline, even though there was nothing really there, except a Clinton operative forcing it into the mainstream news.
[01:10:56.095 --> 01:11:01.497]  Well, you're right exactly in terms of how these operatives for Clinton work.
[01:11:01.497 --> 01:11:11.059]  But I think what I'm trying to point out is that there's another story here, and that is that Giuliani played Stephanopoulos for a chump.
[01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:17.621]  Because Giuliani was happy to say that Trump could pardon himself because that forces the hand.
[01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:23.052]  In other words, he's communicating not to Stephanopoulos, but to Mueller.
[01:11:23.052 --> 01:11:26.834]  If you've got anything on me, you want to impeach me, bring it.
[01:11:26.834 --> 01:11:32.839]  Otherwise, I'm not testifying, we're going to the Supreme Court, and I'm shutting you down.
[01:11:32.839 --> 01:11:35.481]  These are all endgame moves.
[01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:44.247]  These are all calling Mueller's bluff, which means that Trump has decided to expose that Mueller's got nothing and put an end to Mueller's prosecution efforts.
[01:11:44.247 --> 01:11:45.608]  That's what this is really all about.
[01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.997]  So, I estimate then...
[01:11:50.976 --> 01:11:59.102]  With the most recent story coming out of this, Manafort attempted to tamper with witnesses, Mueller prosecutors say.
[01:11:59.102 --> 01:12:02.345]  Every other claim they've made has really been true about them.
[01:12:02.345 --> 01:12:07.089]  So I'm now, I mean, you learn how to play these guys really, really quickly.
[01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:14.354]  So it's my estimation now that they realize that it's them that are guilty of tampering with witnesses.
[01:12:14.354 --> 01:12:19.038]  It's Mueller that's guilty of tampering with witnesses, trying to get them to quote-unquote flip on Trump.
[01:12:19.038 --> 01:12:19.879]  There's nothing to flip on.
[01:12:20.259 --> 01:12:31.322]  But they're the ones that have been tampering with witnesses, tampering with Papadopoulos, tampering, just tampering the whole time with Spygate, lying about it, maybe we spied, oh we spied for your protection, oh well we weren't spying.
[01:12:31.322 --> 01:12:38.805]  So it's, to me it's them that have been tampering with witnesses, now they realize, whoa, that could come back and haunt them, so they're pointing the finger at Manafort.
[01:12:38.805 --> 01:12:40.205]  I mean, this is what they do.
[01:12:40.205 --> 01:12:42.026]  The Russian collusion, I mean, everything.
[01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:48.528]  Do you think that's what's going on with this new narrative that they're saying Manafort tampered with witnesses, Dr. Corsi?
[01:12:49.204 --> 01:12:56.043]  Yes, I think it's exactly what's going on, that Mueller has always badgered... Mueller's a crooked prosecutor.
[01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:58.492]  We know this back to the Enron days.
[01:12:58.492 --> 01:13:00.573]  He badgers witnesses.
[01:13:00.573 --> 01:13:06.158]  He tells them that he's going to do all kinds of horrible things if they don't produce the story he wants.
[01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:07.799]  Threaten to indict them.
[01:13:07.799 --> 01:13:12.883]  Now what he's denying here is Manafort's right to understand what these witnesses are going to say.
[01:13:12.883 --> 01:13:16.146]  Manafort has a right to prepare his testimony.
[01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:20.009]  He's got a right to talk to Mueller's witnesses.
[01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:25.013]  What Mueller's afraid of is that Manafort is going to discover that these witnesses were tampered with
[01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:33.840]  And that's going to be another cause for Mueller to motion the court for a mistrial on prosecutorial misconduct.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:41.666]  And I'm certain that Mueller did banjure the witnesses and that there is prosecutorial misconduct because that's Mueller's M.O.
[01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:43.908]  He does it all the time.
[01:13:43.908 --> 01:13:46.830]  Now let's get into Flynn here in the last two minutes of this segment.
[01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:55.982]  It looks more and more as we're learning more about this that Flynn was the target of spying perhaps even before Trump.
[01:13:57.202 --> 01:14:06.287]  And now you're looking at a situation with General Flynn, how he pleads guilty to a crime he didn't commit, just to avoid all the legal damages and everything.
[01:14:06.287 --> 01:14:08.368]  Now they're saying new evidence is going to clear him of that.
[01:14:08.368 --> 01:14:10.109]  Well, he was already cleared.
[01:14:10.109 --> 01:14:23.117]  You know, but I'm beginning to wonder, looking at Flynn's situation, where if not for his own personal safety, why he declared guilty even though he was innocent, he realized that he was perhaps even a bigger target
[01:14:23.817 --> 01:14:33.422]  Before Trump, of the Deep State, knowing all the knowledge and information he had, and then once he became linked up with Trump, that's when they became really threatened and started spying on Trump.
[01:14:33.422 --> 01:14:40.405]  But what is your estimation right now of Flynn's involvement in this, as we now learn that they were perhaps spying on Flynn years before Trump?
[01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.707]  Well, I don't think Flynn lied.
[01:14:42.707 --> 01:14:45.190]  And I think we now know, I think you're right.
[01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:54.419]  It was to get Flynn because the prosecutors thought he would turn evidence against Donald Trump on the Russian collusion.
[01:14:54.419 --> 01:14:56.340]  But, you know, Flynn did not lie.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:00.184]  And again, it's Mueller's prosecutorial misconduct.
[01:15:00.184 --> 01:15:02.646]  Flynn had to sell his house to defend himself.
[01:15:02.646 --> 01:15:06.250]  Mueller said, if you don't plead guilty, I'm going to investigate criminally your son.
[01:15:06.989 --> 01:15:10.512]  Was acting as the PR assistance for General Flynn at this time.
[01:15:10.512 --> 01:15:18.678]  And we just learned the last two days that Sally Yates lied, that she came over to the White House and said that Flynn was not under investigation.
[01:15:18.678 --> 01:15:23.642]  And when Trump fired Comey, he had no reason to believe that Flynn was going to be indicted.
[01:15:23.642 --> 01:15:26.864]  This whole thing was saying, no, Flynn did not lie.
[01:15:26.864 --> 01:15:28.085]  He did not lie.
[01:15:28.085 --> 01:15:31.928]  And then Strozik and McCabe changed the interrogation report.
[01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:35.430]  Which also, Mueller did not give over to the defense.
[01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.230]  He violated the Brady Rule.
[01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.711]  This thing stinks.
[01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:41.252]  The whole prosecution of Flynn stinks.
[01:15:41.252 --> 01:15:45.353]  They broke all these laws because they didn't think Trump would win.
[01:15:45.353 --> 01:15:48.634]  And they knew if Hillary would have won, they wouldn't have to deal with any of this.
[01:15:48.634 --> 01:15:53.275]  Now they're scurrying about like cockroaches getting shown the light, and they don't know what to do.
[01:15:53.275 --> 01:15:55.016]  They're about to get stepped on and squashed.
[01:15:57.159 --> 01:16:01.041]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:20:22.248 --> 01:20:25.212]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:25.212 --> 01:20:27.414]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.414 --> 01:20:31.319]  Life is full of my face and hands.
[01:20:40.512 --> 01:20:46.015]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I've got a couple things on my desk right here before we get back with Dr. Corsi.
[01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:53.280]  I've got the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste with the colloidal silver and nascent iodine in it.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:02.185]  And then I've got the Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle right here with the same silver and iodine formula right there in a spray bottle.
[01:21:02.185 --> 01:21:05.807]  Now, let me explain to you what's so incredible about these two products.
[01:21:05.807 --> 01:21:09.670]  First of all, the toothpaste here, everybody uses toothpaste.
[01:21:10.376 --> 01:21:11.757]  Alright.
[01:21:11.757 --> 01:21:12.878]  At least I hope.
[01:21:12.878 --> 01:21:14.058]  It's dentist recommended.
[01:21:14.058 --> 01:21:15.819]  You use toothpaste.
[01:21:15.819 --> 01:21:22.764]  So why not use the best toothpaste and shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:22.764 --> 01:21:31.269]  And why this is so incredible, not only is this a great product, not only is this a fantastic toothpaste that I use here, look at the reviews.
[01:21:31.269 --> 01:21:32.229]  3,500 reviews, 4.8 stars.
[01:21:38.109 --> 01:21:40.250]  And you've got it on special right now.
[01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.310]  What is this, 20% off right now, guys?
[01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:46.331]  20% off Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:21:46.331 --> 01:21:52.892]  So if you're not getting your toothpaste from InfoWarsStore.com, why not?
[01:21:52.892 --> 01:22:07.336]  And if you would, if everybody that listened to this broadcast this week went to InfoWarsStore.com and got Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, and then just decided to switch to Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, we could expand
[01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:15.990]  To be 24 hours live, probably by the end of this year, and it would not be near the financial burden that it is.
[01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.951]  With the expansion of the live programming, the hiring more crew, or anything.
[01:22:18.951 --> 01:22:22.653]  So, that's what makes Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste so incredible.
[01:22:22.653 --> 01:22:27.536]  Not only is it a great product, everybody use it, it could fund everything we do here.
[01:22:27.536 --> 01:22:32.759]  Then you have the Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:22:32.759 --> 01:22:34.380]  Now, I bit my lip
[01:22:35.553 --> 01:22:42.337]  On, I think it was either Friday or Saturday, I bit my lip bad and had a huge cut in my lip.
[01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:48.160]  And it's frustrating when you deal with this, it gets swollen, then you bite it again, and then it's bleeding again, and it's like, what do you do?
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:55.864]  And then I thought, wait a second, why don't I use the Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle and spray it on there?
[01:22:55.864 --> 01:23:02.308]  I sprayed it on there Sunday, Monday, and now Tuesday, it's almost totally gone.
[01:23:03.618 --> 01:23:11.061]  That's the power of colloidal silver that we now have in the spray bottle, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Spray, which is also 20% off.
[01:23:11.061 --> 01:23:12.301]  So, great products.
[01:23:12.301 --> 01:23:15.022]  Those are just two examples at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:23:15.022 --> 01:23:26.066]  And then your support, of course, goes right back in to everything we do here, expanding here, hiring more crew, more writers, more reporters, getting more live broadcasts going.
[01:23:26.066 --> 01:23:27.726]  That's what we're doing at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:23:27.726 --> 01:23:32.468]  So your support at InfoWarsTore.com is key to all of that.
[01:23:33.948 --> 01:23:41.616]  Now let's bring in Dr. Corsi again, and I want to get into the Wasserman Schultz story here.
[01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:50.746]  So first of all, you've got Dr. Corsi, the developing Imran Awan investigation that's for the most part gone uncovered, unmentioned.
[01:23:51.914 --> 01:23:53.115]  He's hiding money.
[01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:54.096]  They're laundering money.
[01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:59.020]  He's getting paid millions by Democrats.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:05.405]  His credentials don't really meet the requirements for the IT work that they were hiring for millions of dollars, the Awan brothers.
[01:24:05.405 --> 01:24:07.467]  He tries to escape the country.
[01:24:07.467 --> 01:24:08.628]  Now he's hiding money.
[01:24:08.628 --> 01:24:14.993]  All this stuff is going on, of course, directly related to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was using the Awan brothers.
[01:24:14.993 --> 01:24:18.997]  But then you have, of course, after Wasserman Schultz threatening the police,
[01:24:19.577 --> 01:24:28.427]  Now, she's apparently screaming at house officials to kill the hacking probe, and she's intervening in the Pakistani criminal matter, that's the Awan investigation.
[01:24:28.427 --> 01:24:32.132]  Now, I'll just ask you this, Dr. Corsi, and feel free to take this wherever you want.
[01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:37.583]  Why is Debbie Wasserman Schultz freaking out so much?
[01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:46.330]  Is Debbie Wasserman Schultz freaking out so much because she knows, perhaps, maybe even was in on the money laundering by the Awan brothers?
[01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.952]  That's why they were paying them so much money?
[01:24:48.952 --> 01:24:56.639]  Or, as some are suggesting, she might know the secrets behind the Seth Rich unsolved murder.
[01:24:57.139 --> 01:25:06.041]  Those are just two ideas that are being floated around, but Dr. Corsi, what do you think is making Debbie Wasserman Schultz panic?
[01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:10.203]  Well, let's look at what the Awan brothers were doing.
[01:25:10.203 --> 01:25:22.146]  They were, first of all, running a lot of the computer systems for many of the members of Congress, Democratic members of Congress, and they had access to their classified and security information.
[01:25:22.822 --> 01:25:27.483]  Now, I have no doubt that this was an intelligence operation for the Awan Brothers.
[01:25:27.483 --> 01:25:37.326]  And they're getting this information, my guess is, over to radical Islamic terrorist groups in the Middle East, probably in Pakistan.
[01:25:37.326 --> 01:25:50.369]  And here, Deputy Wasserman Schultz, who authorized these guys to be involved and supported them, is also, and consequentially, guilty of violating national security requirements for handling classified material.
[01:25:51.101 --> 01:26:00.950]  So the whole thing can come down as a major spy scheme that Debbie Wasserman Schultz allowed to be put in place and championed even to this day.
[01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:07.456]  I think what she's scared of is facing charges that may put her in prison for spying, espionage.
[01:26:08.116 --> 01:26:13.824]  And the misuse of classified information through the Iwan brothers that could put her in prison for the rest of her life.
[01:26:13.824 --> 01:26:16.267]  But so what does that make Debbie Wasserman Schultz?
[01:26:16.267 --> 01:26:18.130]  Is she then a spy for Pakistan?
[01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:25.280]  I mean, what advantage does she have bringing in these Pakistanis to essentially what appears to be stealing information?
[01:26:26.138 --> 01:26:33.922]  Well, you're going to find that this was an entire operation in the Obama administration, this tilt toward radical Islam.
[01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:39.644]  Even John Brennan, who I'm convinced was a Muslim, was not allowing you to say radical Islamic terrorism.
[01:26:39.644 --> 01:26:44.947]  If it had anything to do with Islam, it couldn't be terrorist, so the terrorist had to be not Islam.
[01:26:44.947 --> 01:26:49.689]  That's a principle of, that's one of the five pillars of Islam, never say anything bad about Islam.
[01:26:50.313 --> 01:27:00.276]  And you had Huma Abedin, who was an operative working with Hillary, putting all the State Department classified emails on her Yahoo account.
[01:27:00.276 --> 01:27:04.137]  All she had to do was give her a Yahoo password and username.
[01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:07.698]  Anybody in the Middle East, they could read everything from the State Department she was downloading.
[01:27:08.218 --> 01:27:21.150]  So between the Alwan brothers and then Huma Abedin, our enemies, the Muslim terrorists in the Middle East, could have been reading all the classified information that was going through Congress and the State Department.
[01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:24.534]  It's pretty shocking, but I think that's really what's at the bottom of this.
[01:27:24.534 --> 01:27:30.900]  They're both, Hillary and Wasserman Schultz, are worried about going to prison for the rest of their life for espionage.
[01:27:32.176 --> 01:27:39.501]  But Aberdeen, I say, yeah, okay, she directly wouldn't surprise me if she was a spy, a foreign spy.
[01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:42.163]  You know, is Hillary so stupid she doesn't realize it?
[01:27:42.163 --> 01:27:43.583]  I doubt it.
[01:27:43.583 --> 01:27:44.824]  But that I would understand.
[01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:54.190]  So I would understand Aberdeen's role as a spy, but I'm still confused at what Wasserman Schultz is thinking, or is she really just a total moron?
[01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:56.712]  I mean, that to me is the two things here, Corsi.
[01:27:56.712 --> 01:27:58.413]  Like, is she a spy too?
[01:27:58.413 --> 01:27:59.834]  Like, what is she thinking?
[01:27:59.834 --> 01:28:00.935]  Or is she just that stupid?
[01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:02.751]  No, she's not stupid at all.
[01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:04.011]  There's two things involved.
[01:28:04.011 --> 01:28:11.835]  One is the culture of the Obama administration was to do everything under the table they could to tilt to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:28:11.835 --> 01:28:16.057]  Including in Egypt, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, taking over Mubarak.
[01:28:16.784 --> 01:28:19.927]  And then cutting off the aid when LCC took over.
[01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:25.392]  So there's a culture here to get intelligence information to help the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:28:25.392 --> 01:28:30.297]  And Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary think they're doing their appointed task under the table.
[01:28:30.297 --> 01:28:32.499]  And secondly, they're getting very well paid for it.
[01:28:33.059 --> 01:28:38.786]  I'm sure the money laundering was being shared in some form with Wasserman Schultz, I doubt it.
[01:28:38.786 --> 01:28:50.018]  Now I think we're getting into something here because why were they paying the Iwans so much money, ridiculous amounts, millions and millions, that they were then laundering unless they were taking a little bit of that money for themselves.
[01:28:50.018 --> 01:28:52.080]  We're going to have more of this with Dr. Corsi on the other side.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:52.601]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:02.954]  It's a very confusing time in the financial markets and nobody knows that better than financial markets analyst Doug Casey.
[01:29:02.954 --> 01:29:10.219]  Casey Research wants to send you a free copy of Doug's controversial new book about the stock market, our economy, and American politics.
[01:29:10.219 --> 01:29:13.101]  Warning, this book is not politically correct.
[01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:15.963]  Casey is known for his outspoken and brutally honest views.
[01:29:15.963 --> 01:29:18.584]  He once called global warming a political scam.
[01:29:18.584 --> 01:29:22.827]  He's made millions betting on investments seen as too controversial by the mainstream.
[01:29:22.827 --> 01:29:26.970]  In this new book, Casey reveals shocking predictions about hot issues like immigration,
[01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:27.871]  We're good.
[01:29:58.131 --> 01:30:05.759]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:30:05.759 --> 01:30:13.686]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:30:13.686 --> 01:30:16.770]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:22.035]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.035 --> 01:30:26.160]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:29.323]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:34.088]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.088 --> 01:30:37.092]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:52.626]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.626 --> 01:30:54.148]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:56.510]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:58.083 --> 01:31:05.031]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[01:31:05.031 --> 01:31:13.821]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.
[01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:28.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.

[01:31:48.228 --> 01:31:53.614]  Huge Memorial Day specials run throughout this weekend until the month of May ends.

[01:31:57.859 --> 01:32:08.469]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.469 --> 01:32:10.531]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.531 --> 01:32:13.393]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.393 --> 01:32:14.895]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.895 --> 01:32:21.721]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.721 --> 01:32:22.982]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:32:23.783 --> 01:32:33.488]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.488 --> 01:32:50.316]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.316 --> 01:32:53.458]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:53.598 --> 01:33:01.144]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:01.144 --> 01:33:03.786]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:19.683]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:19.683 --> 01:33:25.606]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:25.606 --> 01:33:36.052]  You know, I saw a story on the Drudge Report today that said 70% of Americans polled are burnt out on news.
[01:33:36.052 --> 01:33:41.535]  And that most of them actually were conservative or Republican leaning.
[01:33:41.535 --> 01:33:42.436]  I can relate to that.
[01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:52.461]  I think about it a little deeper, and I think I realize what the frustration here is, Dr. Corsi.
[01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:56.665]  You know, we know what happened.
[01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:00.753]  With the Obama administration spying on Trump.
[01:34:00.753 --> 01:34:05.817]  We know what happened with Hillary Clinton rigging the primaries against Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:05.817 --> 01:34:15.545]  We know what happened with the illegal emails, the illegal servers, Wasserman Schultz's involvement in that, and then Comey writing Clinton off for all the illegal behavior.
[01:34:15.545 --> 01:34:21.511]  We know about Huma Abedin having the classified information on an illegal server, and it's like...
[01:34:22.455 --> 01:34:25.456]  Here we are, we know all this, we know about Mueller.
[01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:35.320]  Now more people are even calling Mueller out for the botched 9-11 investigation where his running of the FBI could be to blame for that.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:50.046]  But we sit here, Dr. Corsi, seemingly banging our heads against the wall with the same facts and the same information, hoping that the walls of deceit, that the walls of misjustice, that the walls of
[01:34:51.346 --> 01:34:56.610]  Well, I want you to see what I see, and that is that President Trump has already started to end Mueller.
[01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:58.311]  That's why I say he's basically called Mueller's bluff.
[01:35:21.573 --> 01:35:21.673]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.664 --> 01:35:40.425]  This is double standard of justice.
[01:35:40.425 --> 01:35:43.467]  The Clintons are never going to face any justice.
[01:35:43.467 --> 01:35:49.151]  It's going to be, we're going to know all these crimes were committed and they're going to get swept under the rug.
[01:35:49.151 --> 01:35:53.033]  I, when I wrote Killing a Deep State, I said there were three phases.
[01:35:53.033 --> 01:35:56.535]  If you read it, I encourage people really to read it.
[01:35:56.535 --> 01:35:59.317]  The second phase is the Trump counterattack.
[01:35:59.317 --> 01:36:06.962]  And for the next two or three years, what we're going to see, I believe, is Donald Trump systematically, and I think he'll take a new special prosecutor.
[01:36:07.632 --> 01:36:17.858]  I don't think you can have the Justice Department investigate itself, but I think you're going to see Donald Trump systematically bring these deep state criminals to justice.
[01:36:17.858 --> 01:36:32.927]  And I'd say phase three ends close to the end of the first term with military tribunals and Donald Trump bringing up issues of treason with the defendants being as high as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[01:36:32.927 --> 01:36:36.609]  Now I've known Donald Trump a long time and I can see him
[01:36:37.538 --> 01:36:39.278]  Confidently playing this game out.
[01:36:39.278 --> 01:36:55.741]  So what I'm looking at is that right now we feel frustrated, but over the next couple of years with what I think is coming, we're going to feel that justice is finally being restored to the United States and the support that Donald Trump has will double or triple.
[01:36:55.741 --> 01:37:01.922]  I mean, Donald Trump is going to be, I think, regarded as one of the most successful presidents in American history.
[01:37:01.922 --> 01:37:05.363]  And he's well on his way to doing that after the first 500 days.
[01:37:05.363 --> 01:37:06.583]  Just be patient.
[01:37:07.193 --> 01:37:08.694]  Because watch and see.
[01:37:08.694 --> 01:37:10.174]  Look at the signs.
[01:37:10.174 --> 01:37:19.397]  We are right now in the end game of the first phase of this chess match, which is the attempt to impeach Donald Trump.
[01:37:19.397 --> 01:37:20.698]  And it's failed.
[01:37:20.698 --> 01:37:24.979]  Now Donald Trump is going to systematically shut down Mueller's operation.
[01:37:24.979 --> 01:37:26.319]  And I see it coming.
[01:37:26.319 --> 01:37:31.021]  I see the pieces coming into place to make that happen.
[01:37:31.021 --> 01:37:36.283]  So you really think that he has got this all planned out to be done in his first four years?
[01:37:37.597 --> 01:37:45.020]  I think a lot of it's, I think, yes I do, I think that the first four years are going to have to be devoted to cleaning up the deep state.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.641]  I mean there's significant accomplishments.
[01:37:47.641 --> 01:37:52.583]  Donald Trump's going to try to make the tax cuts permanent for individuals.
[01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:57.065]  He's going to make sure we get a deal with North Korea and Iran.
[01:37:57.065 --> 01:38:02.627]  Well here's my thing, here's my thing though, just to cut you off before you get going down that road, is that
[01:38:04.739 --> 01:38:13.401]  That stuff he reassures and cements for at least four more years after winning again in 2020, which I fully expect him to win again in 2020.
[01:38:13.401 --> 01:38:15.761]  I don't think it'll even be much of a race.
[01:38:15.761 --> 01:38:22.363]  So I feel like that kind of stuff he can continue to go down with in 2020 as far as his legacy is concerned.
[01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.723]  And then who knows what happens in 2024.
[01:38:23.723 --> 01:38:31.225]  The political landscape is going to be so different then I'm not even going to try to predict what could be happening or what will happen.
[01:38:31.225 --> 01:38:32.425]  But my concern is that
[01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:44.195]  Even though I expect him to win in 2020, if he doesn't get it done in four years, he understands that he has no guarantee of another four years, so he has to get it done in four years.
[01:38:44.195 --> 01:38:54.560]  He has to put Obama testifying on Spygate under oath within his first, you know, four years, because there's no guarantee he has another four.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:03.984]  Well, I think the first four years are going to be devoted to the counterattack, and then the endgame of the counterattack, which is the military tribunals and treason charges.
[01:39:04.716 --> 01:39:10.339]  The bureaucracy will have to be massively cleaned up.
[01:39:10.339 --> 01:39:13.721]  I'd fire 95% of the people, maybe that's not even enough.
[01:39:13.721 --> 01:39:15.642]  I'd close down different bureaus.
[01:39:15.642 --> 01:39:17.423]  I'd shut down the CIA and the FBI immediately.
[01:39:20.103 --> 01:39:26.168]  Well, I'd have term limits on serving in the bureaucracy, as well as term limits on serving in Congress.
[01:39:26.168 --> 01:39:31.913]  But I want to prefigure what I see the next term for Donald Trump can be after 2020.
[01:39:31.913 --> 01:39:39.359]  What I see is that he's going to tackle then even bigger questions like getting rid of the Federal Reserve, getting rid of the U.S.
[01:39:39.359 --> 01:39:46.205]  debt, handling the entitlement problems that we have of out-of-control entitlement spending.
[01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:54.714]  Which is taking 60-70% of our budget these days and is no control in sight in the future.
[01:39:54.714 --> 01:39:58.717]  Those are the problems Donald Trump, I think, will have to tackle in a second administration.
[01:39:58.717 --> 01:39:59.817]  And I really see it.
[01:39:59.817 --> 01:40:04.840]  I mean, I want everybody to kind of understand that, you know, we should be hopeful right now because
[01:40:05.812 --> 01:40:13.996]  Having survived the attempt to impeach Donald Trump, and right now, Mueller's costing the Democrats votes in the midterms.
[01:40:13.996 --> 01:40:16.117]  Oh, the Democrats are screwed.
[01:40:16.117 --> 01:40:18.538]  Yeah, no, the Democrats are in big trouble.
[01:40:18.538 --> 01:40:20.639]  They have only a negative hate Trump policy.
[01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:23.420]  You can't win elections on a negative platform.
[01:40:24.288 --> 01:40:32.632]  That, or Me Too, or Bernie Sanders, and I thought that Alex Jones... Which have both backfired on them for the total frauds that they are.
[01:40:32.632 --> 01:40:36.854]  But I want to just ask you one more question actually, because I forgot to bring this up.
[01:40:36.854 --> 01:40:39.355]  Have you seen Michael Hayden's new book, by any chance?
[01:40:40.222 --> 01:40:42.063]  I've not seen it yet, no.
[01:40:42.063 --> 01:40:45.023]  I know it's out, but there's several of them I have not caught up on.
[01:40:45.023 --> 01:40:45.844]  That's one of them.
[01:40:45.844 --> 01:40:50.685]  I'd like to talk to you about that, because it's interesting.
[01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:56.307]  I'd rather wait for you to actually get some intel on it before we talk about it, but I'll just give you kind of the groundwork, with my understanding.
[01:40:56.307 --> 01:41:00.368]  I didn't read all of it, but I've read excerpts, I've read reviews of it, and other people that read it and covering it.
[01:41:01.118 --> 01:41:24.494]  I was surprised, apparently Michael Hayden writes this book and essentially blames Trump for the collapse of the intelligence agency and it's kind of an anti-Trump book but we were all of this belief and it was our understanding that it was Michael Hayden that went to Trump originally when he found out about the spying to tell Trump about that so that he could respond in whatever manner he deemed
[01:41:25.354 --> 01:41:28.199]  So this book, being anti-Trump, was kind of a shock to me.
[01:41:28.199 --> 01:41:34.529]  I know that you weren't aware of this, but I mean, wasn't it your understanding that it was Hayden that was...
[01:41:36.414 --> 01:41:39.557]  Well, what I'm aware of is that this is part of what Brennan is doing.
[01:41:39.557 --> 01:41:46.163]  The intelligence agencies have caught on that Donald Trump is going to massively reduce the intelligence agencies.
[01:41:46.163 --> 01:41:49.647]  All of the spying that's being done on the U.S.
[01:41:49.647 --> 01:41:58.495]  citizens, including with the Facebook and all the other social media, are spying on us and then censoring conservatives and libertarians.
[01:41:58.495 --> 01:42:00.417]  Donald Trump's going to pull all this in.
[01:42:01.298 --> 01:42:04.962]  Facebook and the others will be regulated through the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:42:04.962 --> 01:42:15.173]  And we're going to have the National Security Agency and others, I think even Julian Assange will be allowed to come back to the country once Donald Trump focuses on the issue without indictment.
[01:42:15.914 --> 01:42:21.420]  And we're going to begin to understand that everything we've been doing has been recorded by the NSA.
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:31.611]  All of our emails, all of our phone calls, every click we make on the Internet, comfortably taken up by Google and the others, that the Internet itself was created by the CIA.
[01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:39.639]  And the real Internet's controlled by the Godfathers, the Larry Ollisons, the... Which Obama even admitted in a slip of the tongue.
[01:42:39.639 --> 01:42:42.061]  I don't even think he realized he admitted that.
[01:42:42.061 --> 01:42:46.546]  Dr. Corsi, thank you so much, at Jerome Corsi on Twitter.
[01:42:46.546 --> 01:42:52.112]  Again, Michael Hayden's book, to me, just proves to you, again, it's the Deep State, which Jerry has the book, Killing the Deep State.
[01:42:52.112 --> 01:42:54.614]  Hayden, another member of the Deep State that hates Trump.
[01:42:54.614 --> 01:42:55.175]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.065 --> 01:43:03.449]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[01:43:06.651 --> 01:43:10.374]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:10.374 --> 01:43:15.056]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:15.056 --> 01:43:18.339]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:19.219 --> 01:43:30.225]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:30.225 --> 01:43:38.749]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:49.438]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:44:58.584 --> 01:45:02.547]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.547 --> 01:45:05.830]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:12.095]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.095 --> 01:45:14.878]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.598 --> 01:45:19.419]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.419 --> 01:45:25.901]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.901 --> 01:45:30.863]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.604 --> 01:45:35.527]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.527 --> 01:45:42.733]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.733 --> 01:45:47.436]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.436 --> 01:45:53.641]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.641 --> 01:45:57.624]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.775 --> 01:46:03.616]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.616 --> 01:46:12.539]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:12.539 --> 01:46:17.861]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:46:17.861 --> 01:46:26.143]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:46:26.263 --> 01:46:26.563]  I think so.
[01:47:00.644 --> 01:47:09.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.205 --> 01:47:14.866]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:14.866 --> 01:47:20.467]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:23.408]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:27.398 --> 01:47:32.060]  Okay, I am going to open up the phone line in the third hour.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.121]  The phone lines, excuse me, for the third hour.
[01:47:35.121 --> 01:47:41.164]  But specifically, I want to talk to the audience about one thing.
[01:47:41.164 --> 01:47:51.488]  What do we do with the knowledge we have about the smartphones, the screen time, what it does to our psychology, our biology,
[01:47:52.702 --> 01:47:59.004]  Our reproductive systems, our DNA even, with the radio waves blasting back and forth.
[01:47:59.004 --> 01:48:02.886]  What do we do moving forward?
[01:48:02.886 --> 01:48:13.830]  How do we implement a plan to curtail the reliance we have on new technology?
[01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:15.031]  Or do we?
[01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:21.233]  Or do we just accept our fate and keep diving deeper and deeper until we can't even come up back to the surface?
[01:48:22.714 --> 01:48:27.997]  So, I want dedicated phone calls just to that topic in the third hour.
[01:48:27.997 --> 01:48:37.604]  What do we do about the smartphone technology as they're about to roll out the AI, which has already been rolled out in kind of a soft rollout?
[01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:42.973]  That they're now kind of just introducing to you as, oh, it's here, accept it.
[01:48:42.973 --> 01:48:49.418]  You're seeing all the new commercials, the Google AI, the Microsoft AI, the AI in the smartphones.
[01:48:49.418 --> 01:48:50.779]  It's all there.
[01:48:50.779 --> 01:49:06.633]  And then you're starting to see some of the AI work or learn where if you search Google, it says that the Republicans are Nazis or that a Republican senator is a bigot.
[01:49:07.455 --> 01:49:10.116]  Well, that's not true and it's not natural.
[01:49:10.116 --> 01:49:16.780]  That's the Google AI that is learning this because of the stuff that goes up online and that it sees.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:26.725]  So it can't really, the AI, being as how it's AI, doesn't really know what fake news is and what fake news isn't.
[01:49:26.725 --> 01:49:36.250]  So it kind of just absorbs everything as is and then cranks it back out as an algorithm based on the measurements of the data
[01:49:37.634 --> 01:49:40.657]  And learns that, oh yeah, Republicans must be Nazis.
[01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:43.620]  That gets said everywhere, so that's the case.
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:49.325]  Oh yeah, a senator, a Republican senator, obviously a bigot, it's all over social media, it's all in the news, must be true.
[01:49:49.325 --> 01:49:53.389]  Of course it's fake news.
[01:49:53.389 --> 01:49:56.692]  But this is all rolling out.
[01:49:56.692 --> 01:50:01.377]  But it gets even worse now.
[01:50:01.377 --> 01:50:02.558]  Because Apple is admitting,
[01:50:04.306 --> 01:50:10.810]  More time on our smartphone is bad, so we're gonna roll out... Oh, oh, and then they have the app.
[01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:13.312]  I almost want to play the video again, where they're like...
[01:50:14.448 --> 01:50:14.848]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:14.848 --> 01:50:15.508]  Oh, thank God.
[01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.769]  This crew, this crew is so great.
[01:50:17.769 --> 01:50:21.730]  Apple is facing criticism about our increasingly... You know what?
[01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.411]  Pause it right there.
[01:50:22.411 --> 01:50:24.171]  I'm going to read this and then play the audio.
[01:50:24.171 --> 01:50:25.232]  Because this is so funny.
[01:50:25.232 --> 01:50:27.152]  Because this is what we're going to discuss in the next segment.
[01:50:27.152 --> 01:50:29.393]  And then have the ESPN app video after this, too.
[01:50:29.393 --> 01:50:31.494]  Because I want to talk about this in the entire third hour.
[01:50:31.494 --> 01:50:32.854]  Because I'm serious.
[01:50:32.854 --> 01:50:35.175]  I mean, we all suffer from this.
[01:50:35.175 --> 01:50:37.436]  I'm not acting above this, folks.
[01:50:37.436 --> 01:50:39.576]  I have my smartphone right next to my bed.
[01:50:39.576 --> 01:50:42.117]  Usually check it right before I go to bed, right when I wake up.
[01:50:42.117 --> 01:50:43.958]  See if I have anything work-related I need to address.
[01:50:45.137 --> 01:50:46.577]  I'm right there with you.
[01:50:46.577 --> 01:50:50.038]  Even though you don't really find me on social media, which I am proud of.
[01:50:50.038 --> 01:50:53.819]  I'm glad I don't have the Instagrams, the Facebooks, the Twitters and all that.
[01:50:53.819 --> 01:50:54.439]  So glad.
[01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:55.719]  So much better.
[01:50:55.719 --> 01:51:03.021]  I'm still scouring for news on the internet, on Drudge, even on Twitter all day long.
[01:51:03.021 --> 01:51:04.681]  So I'm not trying to act like I'm above it.
[01:51:04.681 --> 01:51:05.802]  I'm in there with you.
[01:51:05.802 --> 01:51:07.142]  We're in this together.
[01:51:07.935 --> 01:51:09.696]  But let's go to the Apple video, guys.
[01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:10.756]  Here, pot it back up.
[01:51:10.756 --> 01:51:12.157]  Let me read this.
[01:51:12.157 --> 01:51:16.780]  Apple is facing criticism about our increasingly unhealthy dependence on iPhones.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:18.941]  Well, it's not really Apple's fault, per se.
[01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:22.443]  I guess if they're rigging the screens to flicker at that rate, perhaps.
[01:51:22.443 --> 01:51:25.024]  But, I mean, you still choose to pick it up.
[01:51:25.024 --> 01:51:26.485]  And it's a cool technology.
[01:51:26.485 --> 01:51:30.847]  The company responded Monday with iOS features to help us monitor and limit our storage.
[01:51:30.847 --> 01:51:34.749]  Now, I'm about to tell you the irony of this, but let's pick up the video with audio right from there.
[01:51:36.164 --> 01:51:42.029]  Screen time empowers you with both insight and control over how you spend your time.
[01:51:43.806 --> 01:51:45.887]  And here it is, Apple facing the criticism.
[01:51:45.887 --> 01:51:47.247]  We have a dependence on iPhones.
[01:51:47.247 --> 01:51:48.247]  It's bad for our health.
[01:51:48.247 --> 01:51:51.468]  We have a new app to help you monitor your usage.
[01:51:51.468 --> 01:51:54.289]  And it starts with reports.
[01:51:54.289 --> 01:52:02.712]  Every week, you get a weekly activity summary that details how you used your iPhone or iPad.
[01:52:02.712 --> 01:52:04.693]  You tap in... And they all cheer.
[01:52:04.693 --> 01:52:05.753]  Okay, so you get it.
[01:52:05.753 --> 01:52:06.473]  So pause right there.
[01:52:06.473 --> 01:52:06.933]  So that's fine.
[01:52:06.933 --> 01:52:10.154]  So they give you this bar graph and it shows you how you use your time the whole week.
[01:52:10.154 --> 01:52:10.875]  Yada, yada, yada.
[01:52:10.875 --> 01:52:11.315]  Woo!
[01:52:11.315 --> 01:52:12.015]  Thank you, Apple!
[01:52:13.695 --> 01:52:24.658]  Apple, Google, all of them, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they have been doing that to you since you signed up.
[01:52:24.658 --> 01:52:40.643]  But now they realize the damage, or you realize the damage, the smartphones and all the tech is doing to you, and so they're trying to virtue signal like, okay, we care, let's show them what we've been doing to them, but let's act like we're doing it for them so that they can be healthier.
[01:52:40.643 --> 01:52:41.724]  Yeah, that'll work.
[01:52:42.574 --> 01:52:48.059]  And so then they say, here's the app, monitor your behavior, monitor your phone usage.
[01:52:48.059 --> 01:52:54.105]  We've been monitoring it for decades, now it's your turn.
[01:52:54.105 --> 01:52:56.046]  Oh, man.
[01:52:56.046 --> 01:52:57.348]  So what do we do?
[01:52:57.348 --> 01:52:59.350]  I open up the phone lines for the entire third hour, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.430]  1-877-789-2539.
[01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.590]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:53:09.864 --> 01:53:23.116]  Yeah, and you are actually seeing this in sales, where sales of smartphones have actually already peaked and are now kind of trending downward.
[01:53:23.116 --> 01:53:26.720]  But we know about the negative side effects of cell phones.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.643]  We know about the negative side effects of the screen time.
[01:53:30.723 --> 01:53:43.847]  Now we're learning about the negative side effects of the 4G and what's soon to be the 5G radio waves that are going to just destroy our environment when it hits 6G will be dead.
[01:53:43.847 --> 01:53:55.991]  So, but they don't, but see, but Apple doesn't point that out, say, we're actually going to reconsider and look into the 5G here before we roll it out because there might be some serious negative health
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:57.160]  I don't
[01:54:16.815 --> 01:54:19.176]  Human domain dies.
[01:54:19.176 --> 01:54:20.837]  They're going to become machines and live forever.
[01:54:20.837 --> 01:54:21.937]  That's their plan.
[01:54:21.937 --> 01:54:33.222]  So yeah, create the 5G, the 6G, boils the environment, makes it impossible for humans to live unless they upload their brain to a computer chip.
[01:54:33.222 --> 01:54:35.923]  So again, I open up the phone lines 1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:54:35.923 --> 01:54:36.823]  What do we do about this?
[01:54:36.823 --> 01:54:37.363]  How do we beat
[01:54:41.505 --> 01:54:51.733]  The addiction to smartphones now with the dependence and the reliance we have on them for day-to-day activities, for work, for communication, what have you.
[01:54:51.733 --> 01:54:58.859]  But the craziest thing when you think about this is it wasn't long ago when smartphones didn't even exist.
[01:54:58.859 --> 01:55:05.645]  I mean, all you got to do is flash back, what, a decade, 15 years?
[01:55:05.645 --> 01:55:07.086]  You didn't even have a smartphone.
[01:55:09.622 --> 01:55:15.125]  Shoot, 15 years ago, if you had a camera attached to your phone, that was groundbreaking!
[01:55:15.125 --> 01:55:23.911]  But we've come so far in such a short period of time, where now the dependence is habitual.
[01:55:23.911 --> 01:55:27.113]  Yeah, and then ESPN has the ad, we don't need to roll it again, where...
[01:55:27.967 --> 01:55:31.968]  They're promoting their new app, and it's like, here's a guy at a party with friends, what is he doing?
[01:55:31.968 --> 01:55:33.348]  He's staring at his smartphone.
[01:55:33.348 --> 01:55:38.029]  Here's a guy walking on a beautiful beach, beautiful weather, beautiful day, what is he doing?
[01:55:38.029 --> 01:55:39.650]  He's watching his smartphone.
[01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:45.971]  Here's a guy surfing, he's got a surfboard, he's at the beach, but he's watching his smartphone.
[01:55:45.971 --> 01:55:50.352]  Here's a guy at breakfast, nice little breakfast diner, outside, what's he doing?
[01:55:50.352 --> 01:55:53.353]  Watching his smartphone.
[01:55:53.353 --> 01:55:54.413]  So then, oh yeah!
[01:55:55.694 --> 01:55:56.855]  Well, what's the point?
[01:55:56.855 --> 01:55:58.215]  I might as well become a machine.
[01:55:58.215 --> 01:56:00.837]  I don't live in the real world as it is!
[01:56:00.837 --> 01:56:06.300]  I'm already living in my smartphone, so who needs the real world?
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:08.001]  So what do we do about this, folks?
[01:56:08.001 --> 01:56:09.022]  Again, I'm not asking...
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:11.420]  To hear what you think.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.100]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.360]  Like, what do we do?
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.501]  I'm in this with you.
[01:56:14.501 --> 01:56:18.141]  Yeah, there's pictures the crew's showing of the kids, children.
[01:56:18.141 --> 01:56:20.462]  Basically, you know, it used to be the television raised the kids.
[01:56:20.462 --> 01:56:21.902]  Now it's the smartphone.
[01:56:21.902 --> 01:56:35.824]  We played the intro coming into a segment this hour where people just looking at their smartphones, walk into pools, walk into holes, walk into each other, walk into traffic, get in car accidents.
[01:56:35.824 --> 01:56:38.845]  And you see where it goes.
[01:56:39.813 --> 01:56:43.817]  You see where this ends.
[01:56:43.817 --> 01:56:44.778]  So what do we do?
[01:56:44.778 --> 01:56:45.959]  How do we be proactive?
[01:56:45.959 --> 01:56:48.441]  Do we even want to stop this?
[01:56:48.441 --> 01:56:52.225]  So that's what I open up the phone lines with, and we'll do that for the entire third hour.
[01:56:52.225 --> 01:56:54.227]  But folks, please support us at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:57:56.889 --> 01:58:00.390]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[01:58:48.004 --> 01:58:55.628]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:55.628 --> 01:59:03.551]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:59:03.551 --> 01:59:06.633]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:11.919]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:59:11.919 --> 01:59:16.043]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:59:16.043 --> 01:59:19.207]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:59:19.207 --> 01:59:23.972]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:23.972 --> 01:59:26.996]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.416 --> 01:59:42.508]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:44.030]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:51.736]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:51.736 --> 01:59:54.378]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:08.103]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:00:08.103 --> 02:00:10.384]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:00:10.384 --> 02:00:14.246]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.246 --> 02:00:18.909]  Okay, I am getting a bunch of callers right now lined up by the crew.
[02:00:18.909 --> 02:00:21.850]  The topic we're going to be discussing here in the third hour.
[02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:27.433]  What do we do about the smartphone technology that's now taking over our life?
[02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:34.133]  And it's not just that it's taken over our life, it's that we know of all the negative health effects.
[02:00:34.133 --> 02:00:37.115]  We know about the negative effects of the 5G.
[02:00:37.115 --> 02:00:49.782]  We know about the negative side effects, physically and psychologically, of all of the screen time, of the flicker rates.
[02:00:49.782 --> 02:00:51.763]  So what do we do about it?
[02:00:51.763 --> 02:00:52.764]  What are we doing about it?
[02:00:52.764 --> 02:00:53.864]  What do we do about it?
[02:00:53.864 --> 02:00:54.925]  Can we do anything about it?
[02:00:56.889 --> 02:00:58.710]  A brief discussion in the break with the crew.
[02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:03.212]  I mean, honestly, I don't know.
[02:01:03.212 --> 02:01:04.012]  I don't have an answer.
[02:01:04.012 --> 02:01:05.973]  I'm riding this with you.
[02:01:05.973 --> 02:01:09.415]  I might not be the worst, but I'm certainly not the best.
[02:01:09.415 --> 02:01:10.955]  I still use my smartphone.
[02:01:10.955 --> 02:01:12.476]  I have two smartphones!
[02:01:18.644 --> 02:01:19.505]  So what do we do?
[02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:22.407]  I mean, how do we buck this?
[02:01:22.407 --> 02:01:24.669]  How do we change this tide?
[02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:30.293]  How do we slow this momentum or re-navigate this momentum?
[02:01:30.293 --> 02:01:31.614]  And you know where it ends.
[02:01:31.614 --> 02:01:33.135]  There's a great illustration right there.
[02:01:33.135 --> 02:01:34.557]  You're trapped in your smartphone.
[02:01:34.557 --> 02:01:36.578]  It becomes your prison.
[02:01:36.578 --> 02:01:37.999]  And you know where it ends, folks.
[02:01:37.999 --> 02:01:43.884]  Eventually, you literally plug in to the machine and become the machine.
[02:01:45.526 --> 02:01:51.431]  Which then enters an entire new realm of debate, which is, do you want to die?
[02:01:51.431 --> 02:01:58.956]  Or do you want to live forever as a machine?
[02:01:58.956 --> 02:01:59.597]  Yeah.
[02:01:59.597 --> 02:02:09.845]  I love that image that we have in that intro, where you have a group of girls at a baseball game, and there's like 12 of them, and not one of them is watching the game.
[02:02:09.845 --> 02:02:12.247]  They're all on their smartphone.
[02:02:12.247 --> 02:02:12.367]  Yeah.
[02:02:13.143 --> 02:02:16.065]  Smartphone, selfie, duck face.
[02:02:16.065 --> 02:02:16.866]  Woo!
[02:02:16.866 --> 02:02:21.289]  Looking down, texting a friend.
[02:02:21.289 --> 02:02:23.491]  You know, that girl has a St.
[02:02:23.491 --> 02:02:27.894]  Louis Cardinal hat on, taking the duck face selfie, but that is not from St.
[02:02:27.894 --> 02:02:31.337]  Louis, so I just want to stand up for my city.
[02:02:31.337 --> 02:02:34.980]  That is not Bush Stadium.
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:35.380]  Anyway.
[02:02:36.578 --> 02:02:42.583]  I mean, you see, if you go to a ballgame, whenever I can, I like to enjoy live sports.
[02:02:42.583 --> 02:02:44.024]  If I go to a Cardinal game in St.
[02:02:44.024 --> 02:02:52.732]  Louis at Busch Stadium, you just look around and half the crowd is staring at their smartphone.
[02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:54.593]  And I grew up going to ballgames.
[02:02:54.593 --> 02:03:03.461]  I mean, I'm like 14 years old and my dad is dropping me off with five bucks so I can go get a bleacher seat.
[02:03:03.461 --> 02:03:04.102]  And I would go
[02:03:05.250 --> 02:03:11.374]  With five bucks, get a bleacher seat, maybe take some peanuts with me, and that was it.
[02:03:11.374 --> 02:03:13.435]  And for three hours, I enjoyed it.
[02:03:13.435 --> 02:03:14.636]  I loved watching the game.
[02:03:14.636 --> 02:03:16.297]  I didn't need a smartphone.
[02:03:16.297 --> 02:03:17.538]  I don't even like these new stadiums.
[02:03:17.538 --> 02:03:23.422]  They got 500 screens, 500 graphics flashing around you all the time, games going on.
[02:03:23.422 --> 02:03:27.005]  I'm like, man, what happened to people wanting to go watch the game?
[02:03:27.005 --> 02:03:33.469]  What happened to people wanting to watch other humans be masters at their craft, do incredible things?
[02:03:33.469 --> 02:03:35.190]  Now you just sit on your smartphone and watch.
[02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:36.511]  Oh, did something happen?
[02:03:36.511 --> 02:03:40.673]  Woo!
[02:03:40.673 --> 02:03:42.114]  So what do we do?
[02:03:42.114 --> 02:03:42.574]  What do we do?
[02:03:42.574 --> 02:03:45.216]  Yeah, there is the image right there.
[02:03:45.216 --> 02:03:50.159]  That's actually an Arlington ballpark in Texas.
[02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:57.664]  That is the Texas Rangers ballpark that these girls... Are you intentionally zooming in on the St.
[02:03:57.664 --> 02:04:00.885]  Louis hat?
[02:04:00.885 --> 02:04:02.607]  Isn't that so trendy?
[02:04:03.641 --> 02:04:06.443]  I'm eating, what is that, like a churro?
[02:04:06.443 --> 02:04:07.784]  Taking a duck face selfie?
[02:04:07.784 --> 02:04:12.668]  Oh, and now you know what they have to do?
[02:04:12.668 --> 02:04:16.431]  Now, they have to put up a screen.
[02:04:16.431 --> 02:04:29.742]  Now in Major League Baseball, they have to put up a screen, like all around the foul territory, because people keep getting hit with baseballs, because they're not even watching the game!
[02:04:31.943 --> 02:04:34.605]  So people staring down at their smartphone.
[02:04:34.605 --> 02:04:35.085]  Yeah, there's one.
[02:04:35.085 --> 02:04:39.388]  This guy gets hit in the face with a basketball because he's not even watching.
[02:04:39.388 --> 02:04:42.010]  They're both staring at a smartphone.
[02:04:42.010 --> 02:04:47.754]  So now you have to make a fan safe environment because they're not even paying attention to the game.
[02:04:47.754 --> 02:04:51.836]  So they can be totally droned out on their smartphone, not even watching the game.
[02:04:51.836 --> 02:04:53.918]  And then they don't get hit in the head with a ball.
[02:04:53.918 --> 02:04:55.519]  They have to go to the game with a helmet on.
[02:04:56.428 --> 02:04:58.749]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:09.037 --> 02:06:12.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:12.522 --> 02:06:15.026]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:39.056]  Okay, I'll pepper in some news, but for the next hour, until Paul Joseph Watson takes over the fourth hour here at the Alex Jones Show, I'm taking your call specifically on what do we do about the smartphone, cell phone technology, soon to be the 5G, that is literally killing us.
[02:06:39.056 --> 02:06:42.559]  It's literally destroying us, and you know where the endgame goes.
[02:06:42.559 --> 02:06:48.304]  We literally have to become machines just to survive, or we're so dependent on machines,
[02:06:48.744 --> 02:06:54.408]  We have to plug into the digital machine or get a brain chip or whatever it is.
[02:06:54.408 --> 02:06:55.949]  And that's where it's going.
[02:06:55.949 --> 02:06:59.271]  You know, I'm gonna tell you something right here about this story.
[02:06:59.271 --> 02:07:04.494]  AI brain chips will create a new breed of superhumans who can communicate via telepathy.
[02:07:04.494 --> 02:07:06.035]  You wanna know something?
[02:07:06.035 --> 02:07:09.257]  You can already communicate via telepathy, folks.
[02:07:09.257 --> 02:07:12.880]  You already have that innate ability built in you.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:17.002]  Now, you know that we only use, on average, I think about 10% of our brains,
[02:07:19.281 --> 02:07:27.226]  But I bet you've experienced probably some form of telepathy in your life.
[02:07:27.226 --> 02:07:28.706]  And you can do it.
[02:07:28.706 --> 02:07:29.927]  You can manipulate it.
[02:07:29.927 --> 02:07:32.088]  It's part of the secret human history that they don't tell you.
[02:07:32.088 --> 02:07:37.772]  I mean, we don't even know the secrets of our pineal gland.
[02:07:37.772 --> 02:07:46.617]  I mean... So we have all these amazing abilities already as humans that we don't even try to tap into.
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:49.640]  It's just incredible.
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:53.802]  So that's what we're going to be talking about here for the rest of the hour.
[02:07:53.802 --> 02:07:58.224]  What do we do about the technology killing us, the 5G?
[02:07:58.224 --> 02:08:00.185]  How do we stop it?
[02:08:00.185 --> 02:08:03.566]  How do we stop the momentum of our dependence on it?
[02:08:03.566 --> 02:08:05.307]  Let's go out to the phone lines now.
[02:08:05.307 --> 02:08:07.488]  Let's start with Jim in California.
[02:08:07.488 --> 02:08:10.329]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:08:10.329 --> 02:08:11.589]  How you doing?
[02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:13.510]  Just fine.
[02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:14.370]  All right.
[02:08:14.370 --> 02:08:15.711]  I've tried some things that
[02:08:17.543 --> 02:08:18.363]  Have helped me a lot.
[02:08:18.363 --> 02:08:24.905]  In fact, I found I sleep better is number one, shut everything off at night, including the Wi-Fi in your house.
[02:08:24.905 --> 02:08:29.226]  I bought a blocket pocket from you and I keep my phone in it.
[02:08:29.226 --> 02:08:34.347]  And yeah, it takes a minute when I pull it out, go back and hook back up to the net so that it works.
[02:08:34.347 --> 02:08:39.628]  But that minute, that little bit of time is worth some of my life.
[02:08:39.628 --> 02:08:46.210]  You can get a reasonable meter that'll measure electromagnetic frequency.
[02:08:47.411 --> 02:08:57.861]  And there's a simple demonstration they showed on YouTube on putting a Faraday cage over your smart meter.
[02:08:57.861 --> 02:09:01.465]  Metal mesh screen.
[02:09:01.465 --> 02:09:02.706]  This is actually incredible, Jim.
[02:09:02.706 --> 02:09:04.508]  There's a guy that works here.
[02:09:04.508 --> 02:09:07.290]  He's been working here for I think a decade here.
[02:09:07.290 --> 02:09:08.812]  One of our social media gurus.
[02:09:10.316 --> 02:09:10.516]  I don't
[02:09:32.068 --> 02:09:35.029]  All of these waves are invisible.
[02:09:35.029 --> 02:09:41.332]  If you could see all the radio waves that are going through, we wouldn't even be able to see an inch in front of our face.
[02:09:41.332 --> 02:09:42.492]  But I like that.
[02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:46.994]  Turning off the Wi-Fi, unplugging it and all that stuff.
[02:09:46.994 --> 02:09:49.715]  But I don't know if that really helps the overall issue.
[02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:57.538]  That might kind of be one thing to say for each individual to help you with your health and to stop the waves from hitting you all the time.
[02:09:57.538 --> 02:10:00.840]  But I don't know if it really stops the momentum of where we're going here, Jim.
[02:10:02.202 --> 02:10:08.710]  Well, I agree with you, but the one thing that you need, and like you and Alex both need it, sleep.
[02:10:08.710 --> 02:10:11.834]  Find a way to make your bedroom peaceful.
[02:10:11.834 --> 02:10:19.704]  My next step here, I found that stainless steel mesh is cheaper than copper, and I can hang that on the walls, you know, hide it.
[02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:23.193]  Underneath the paneling on the walls of my bedroom.
[02:10:23.193 --> 02:10:28.259]  And now it doesn't infiltrate my bedroom but it doesn't look like a Faraday cage either.
[02:10:28.259 --> 02:10:35.448]  And just leave those devices out of the room and make sure at least you shut yourself off at night and let your brain rest.
[02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:40.713]  So it's not getting fried constantly, because just walking around in the world you're going to get it.
[02:10:40.713 --> 02:10:43.056]  Unless you're wearing a foil hat or something.
[02:10:43.056 --> 02:10:45.438]  Hey, that's it!
[02:10:45.438 --> 02:10:47.560]  We've got to bring back the foil hats!
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:50.343]  We're going to start selling foil hats at InfoWarsStore.com!
[02:10:51.969 --> 02:10:58.433]  You guys come up with a hat that is made with the same mesh as the blocket pocket so you can put it on your head.
[02:10:58.433 --> 02:11:00.734]  Do you remember?
[02:11:00.734 --> 02:11:02.075]  The audience probably doesn't remember this.
[02:11:02.075 --> 02:11:07.198]  There's this girl, it was a Donald Sterling thing, Vivian Steviano, I think was her name.
[02:11:07.198 --> 02:11:15.423]  She used to walk around in a, what do the steel melders wear?
[02:11:15.423 --> 02:11:16.584]  Like the steel melder hat?
[02:11:21.835 --> 02:11:24.637]  I'm joking, but here's the thing.
[02:11:24.637 --> 02:11:28.279]  That is going to be an industry.
[02:11:28.279 --> 02:11:39.986]  Mark my words, that is going to be an industry with helmets and body suits or even homes where it's all an Inferity Enclosure.
[02:11:39.986 --> 02:11:42.707]  Or bedrooms, or they'll make paints.
[02:11:42.707 --> 02:11:46.830]  That's going to be a market where they create an entire marketplace
[02:11:48.632 --> 02:11:53.154]  For you to fight back against all the radio waves that are destroying you.
[02:11:53.154 --> 02:11:54.355]  And Jim is completely right.
[02:11:54.355 --> 02:11:56.296]  Thank you for the call, Jim.
[02:11:56.296 --> 02:11:57.677]  And again, I know he's right.
[02:11:57.677 --> 02:12:00.458]  And it's like, I can't even do it.
[02:12:00.458 --> 02:12:02.399]  And I don't know if you've been able to notice.
[02:12:02.399 --> 02:12:02.899]  Oh, look at that.
[02:12:02.899 --> 02:12:05.340]  Radiation blocking boxers.
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.701]  I want to get some of these.
[02:12:06.701 --> 02:12:09.122]  We should probably sell them.
[02:12:09.122 --> 02:12:10.183]  I'm not even kidding.
[02:12:10.183 --> 02:12:12.884]  You walk around with your cell phone right next to your testicles.
[02:12:12.884 --> 02:12:13.745]  Excuse me.
[02:12:13.745 --> 02:12:17.947]  It's blasting them with waves, destroying your ability to procreate.
[02:12:18.991 --> 02:12:20.592]  Sorry, I'd like to have kids.
[02:12:20.592 --> 02:12:23.174]  So, I need to get these boxers apparently.
[02:12:23.174 --> 02:12:24.375]  We should probably sell them.
[02:12:24.375 --> 02:12:26.356]  But that's going to be a huge marketplace.
[02:12:26.356 --> 02:12:31.480]  That's not even a joke.
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:37.924]  I just, again though, I guess it's just impossible to stop.
[02:12:37.924 --> 02:12:40.186]  But the caller Jim was right.
[02:12:40.186 --> 02:12:42.707]  You really should be turning this stuff down.
[02:12:42.707 --> 02:12:43.568]  Yeah, there's a story.
[02:12:43.568 --> 02:12:44.669]  This is even the Huffington Post.
[02:12:45.987 --> 02:12:47.928]  How your cell phone might be hurting your sperm.
[02:12:47.928 --> 02:12:48.969]  No, it's not a mite.
[02:12:48.969 --> 02:12:50.709]  It is.
[02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:51.230]  It is.
[02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:54.351]  It's also hurting female eggs.
[02:12:54.351 --> 02:12:58.153]  It's all old news and they just keep rolling it out.
[02:12:58.153 --> 02:13:02.296]  We don't even do anything.
[02:13:02.296 --> 02:13:10.300]  See, this is why yesterday I was so irked of the Supreme Court case being such a huge story.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.421]  A freaking gay wedding cake, bro?
[02:13:15.148 --> 02:13:17.289]  Which, oh, and then they do the research.
[02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:22.232]  It turns out that the two gay guys doing this were militant left-wing radicals.
[02:13:22.232 --> 02:13:32.238]  They specifically looked for the one baker that they knew would say no, and then they made a national case out of it, and then they lost big, 7-2.
[02:13:32.238 --> 02:13:34.359]  Mainstream media says narrow decision.
[02:13:34.359 --> 02:13:36.981]  It was a total blowout.
[02:13:36.981 --> 02:13:38.342]  And that's the big story.
[02:13:38.342 --> 02:13:41.904]  Meanwhile, cell phone technology's killing us all!
[02:13:43.086 --> 02:13:44.127]  So how do we stop it?
[02:13:44.127 --> 02:13:47.230]  Jim has a solution, I think, in the short term.
[02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:48.591]  Not sure how it works in the long term.
[02:13:48.591 --> 02:13:52.174]  Let's jump out to Josh, calling in from Oregon.
[02:13:52.174 --> 02:13:56.898]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:13:56.898 --> 02:14:03.683]  So, I wanted to make the comparison between cell phones and cigarettes, because I think there's a lot of comparisons there.
[02:14:03.683 --> 02:14:05.945]  I mean, for one thing, they're obviously clearly addictive.
[02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:10.632]  And obviously there's also bogus science that was behind both of them.
[02:14:10.632 --> 02:14:18.756]  You know, when you look at cigarettes, for a period of time there was dentists and doctors coming out and recommending certain brands, even.
[02:14:18.756 --> 02:14:22.838]  And so you've got this thing where society's addicted to it.
[02:14:22.838 --> 02:14:28.561]  They think that you're a kook or some kind of nut if you say that it's actually bad for you.
[02:14:28.561 --> 02:14:36.865]  And the problem here is not only do you have industries that can profit off of it, but you've got, you know, different entities that can clearly control society.
[02:14:37.667 --> 02:14:38.068]  I think so.
[02:14:46.349 --> 02:14:50.712]  People are, I would say, more addicted to their smartphones than they are to cigarettes.
[02:14:50.712 --> 02:14:53.793]  And this is actually, this is actually a great caller.
[02:14:53.793 --> 02:15:00.217]  Let's hold Josh, hold Josh, because I like the intellectual analogy you just made to cigarettes.
[02:15:00.217 --> 02:15:10.803]  I want to have that, I actually want to continue that conversation on the other side, because that is actually, we can actually kind of paint a lot of parallels with that and the smartphones, but let's do that on the other side.
[02:15:10.803 --> 02:15:11.964]  In the meantime, we're about to go to break.
[02:15:11.964 --> 02:15:15.006]  I'm taking your calls the rest of this hour before Paul Joseph Watson takes over, but please,

[02:20:37.489 --> 02:20:39.950]  We're taking your calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:41.312 --> 02:20:52.105]  Discussing the implications of cell phone technology, all the screen time, what it does to the youth, what it does to us, what it does to our humanity.
[02:20:52.105 --> 02:20:55.809]  No Supreme Court case, no, that's a gay cake.
[02:20:55.809 --> 02:20:59.894]  But cell phones that, you know, could pretty much destroy our environment.
[02:21:01.209 --> 02:21:04.870]  The other recent studies, we just ignore that.
[02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:10.451]  So we're taking your call specifically on that issue at 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:21:10.451 --> 02:21:13.192]  Now, I held Josh over because he was making a good point.
[02:21:13.192 --> 02:21:16.913]  He kind of got cut short on the break, so I wanted to bring it back to Josh.
[02:21:16.913 --> 02:21:20.154]  Josh, get back to the point you were making comparing in the past
[02:21:20.734 --> 02:21:33.868]  To other things, where you kind of had a similar situation where maybe we knew about the negative health effects, maybe we didn't, maybe they're consistent, maybe they're inconsistent, maybe we still don't know, and you were using the comparison of cigarettes to that.
[02:21:33.868 --> 02:21:37.092]  So just get back on your point, start from wherever you want, Josh and Organ.
[02:21:38.376 --> 02:21:39.917]  Sure thing, sure thing.
[02:21:39.917 --> 02:21:54.405]  So, the reason I think it's actually way more dangerous, though, is because with cigarettes, you had, you know, obvious profit motivation, and you've got these industries, you know, that are going to pay lots of money to lobby, to have scientists and others say, like, look, this is good for you, because they want to make a profit.
[02:21:54.805 --> 02:22:23.793]  With cell phones, not only is it extremely addictive, but you've got these weird social scientists who are now getting in there and they can manipulate people, they can cause us to become infertile, they can help to guide the way that we think, and that makes it exponentially more dangerous, because you've also got the profit motivation for all these people who are glad to be a part of it for that reason, but then you've also got the social control aspect of it, which just makes it so incredibly dangerous, and it's become a part of
[02:22:24.338 --> 02:22:25.619]  Almost everyone's life.
[02:22:25.619 --> 02:22:30.101]  I mean, we're completely in zealot by, you know, the technology that is around us nowadays.
[02:22:30.101 --> 02:22:39.566]  Well, and that's where I wanted to... So let's keep it right there for a second with this comparison in the cigarettes to smartphones and kind of the same deal as far as the health concerns behind it, yet the rollout anyway.
[02:22:41.082 --> 02:22:42.442]  I agree with you.
[02:22:42.442 --> 02:22:47.083]  Cigarettes probably not near as big of an issue as the smartphones, because I agree.
[02:22:47.083 --> 02:22:55.865]  I think more people are using smartphones where you didn't have children, you know, growing up by the age of three smoking cigarettes.
[02:22:55.865 --> 02:23:01.466]  You do have children by the age of three on the smartphones, on the tablets, using that technology.
[02:23:01.466 --> 02:23:03.527]  So I do agree that that's more of a threat.
[02:23:03.527 --> 02:23:08.988]  You've also got just the fact that, you know, you still choose whether or not you want to smoke a cigarette.
[02:23:09.728 --> 02:23:12.330]  Cigarette smokers are actually decreasing.
[02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:13.671]  There's multiple reasons for this.
[02:23:13.671 --> 02:23:16.333]  Alternatives, the vaping and everything.
[02:23:16.333 --> 02:23:21.497]  But with the smartphones, it's like you kind of don't have a choice in some aspects of life.
[02:23:21.497 --> 02:23:22.838]  You need the smartphone to work.
[02:23:22.838 --> 02:23:25.220]  Everybody has a cell phone at least.
[02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:29.383]  And then you kind of bring it to the second-hand issue where it's like, okay, second-hand smoke.
[02:23:29.383 --> 02:23:30.364]  Is it bad?
[02:23:30.364 --> 02:23:31.585]  Is it not bad?
[02:23:31.585 --> 02:23:33.146]  Is there really this negative side effect?
[02:23:33.146 --> 02:23:34.047]  Do we really not know?
[02:23:34.727 --> 02:23:39.749]  Well, with the second-hand cell phone radiation, that's not even an option.
[02:23:39.749 --> 02:23:47.771]  It's like you can't get away from the cell phone radiation unless, you know, you're like 500 miles removed from society.
[02:23:47.771 --> 02:23:48.771]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:23:48.771 --> 02:24:00.135]  And when you look at the damage that it does to society, not only individuals, but society, we're more socially disconnected now than we've ever been, even though we're able to connect with people all around the world instantaneously.
[02:24:00.885 --> 02:24:03.306]  We get so enveloped in that, the dopamine hits.
[02:24:03.306 --> 02:24:07.867]  Yeah, like there's people, there's people, I used to ride the bus in St.
[02:24:07.867 --> 02:24:09.488]  Louis for like five years.
[02:24:09.488 --> 02:24:10.928]  I took public transportation.
[02:24:10.928 --> 02:24:19.411]  I remember there'd be some days where I wouldn't feel like listening to music or, you know, listening to podcasts or whatever and I wouldn't have headphones in and I'd like try to talk to people.
[02:24:20.359 --> 02:24:23.741]  Like either sitting at the bus stop or on the metro or whatever.
[02:24:23.741 --> 02:24:26.362]  And there's people out there that are literally like, they're shocked.
[02:24:26.362 --> 02:24:27.743]  They're like, what is this?
[02:24:27.743 --> 02:24:29.724]  Is he trying to talk to me?
[02:24:29.724 --> 02:24:33.186]  Is this person trying to use words to communicate with me?
[02:24:33.186 --> 02:24:34.447]  I don't understand.
[02:24:34.447 --> 02:24:43.492]  So there's like another aspect that you just brought up too, where it's like we're having this communication breakdown where we don't even know how to socially interact anymore.
[02:24:45.419 --> 02:24:46.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.163]  I mean, when you look at the levels of, you know, even teen suicide, you know, it's going up.
[02:24:51.163 --> 02:24:56.005]  I mean, it's just really causing a lot of problems for, I mean, the youth especially.
[02:24:56.005 --> 02:25:00.728]  And, you know, we know we've been warned by people like Steve Jobs, heads of Facebook.
[02:25:00.728 --> 02:25:06.292]  Still, the conventional wisdom, for whatever reason, is that, you know, you're a kook if you say that this stuff's bad for you.
[02:25:07.113 --> 02:25:08.534]  Well, thank you for the call, Josh.
[02:25:08.534 --> 02:25:09.434]  Great call.
[02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:27.203]  And just to kind of play both sides of the aisle here and be fair with it, just, and I don't know if this is actually fair when it comes down to the science, but, you know, let's not recall, or let's do recall that you've got all the claims about cigarettes and cancer and secondhand smoke and all that stuff.
[02:25:27.203 --> 02:25:35.887]  I've got a great aunt that is, like, pushing 90 years old, who's been smoking cigarettes since she was 15 years old, probably a pack a day,
[02:25:37.003 --> 02:25:44.670]  And, you know, can still run like she's in college.
[02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:47.553]  So how do you explain that?
[02:25:47.553 --> 02:25:55.019]  Do you have that same kind of application to the cell phones where maybe it affects others more than some?
[02:25:55.019 --> 02:25:55.800]  I'm just asking questions.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:58.522]  I'm trying to figure this out with you here on the air.
[02:25:58.522 --> 02:26:01.665]  Let's now go to GD in Florida.
[02:26:01.665 --> 02:26:02.206]  Go ahead, GD.
[02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:07.662]  Hey, Owen, this is Judy in Florida.
[02:26:07.662 --> 02:26:08.763]  Alright, Judy.
[02:26:08.763 --> 02:26:14.967]  Hey, um, I want to read you a quote real quick, and I want to see if you can tell me who said this.
[02:26:14.967 --> 02:26:34.200]  I think it is fair to say at this point, and we're not trying to compare this to things in the past as far as wars are concerned, but we're essentially in a civil war right now for this country, where people versus, we the people versus the brainwashed masses and the corrupt Washington establishment that hurts them.
[02:26:36.147 --> 02:26:39.349]  I don't know.
[02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:40.510]  No, go ahead.
[02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:41.090]  You did.
[02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:42.151]  Oh, you just quoted me?
[02:26:42.151 --> 02:26:45.513]  I don't even know what I said.
[02:26:45.513 --> 02:26:49.756]  And yeah, when it comes to quotes, when I think something is spot on, I go ahead and write it down.
[02:26:49.756 --> 02:26:50.536]  Yeah, it was you.
[02:26:50.536 --> 02:26:51.657]  Judy in Florida.
[02:26:51.657 --> 02:26:54.059]  Man, we ought to hire you.
[02:26:54.059 --> 02:26:57.161]  Well, that's strictly up to you.
[02:26:57.161 --> 02:26:59.883]  But no, I'm just calling because, uh,
[02:27:01.718 --> 02:27:21.435]  I have a lot of experience talking to and dealing with people that when you talk about the dangers of cell phones, I've been trying to build my business to the point where I don't have to do the actual work anymore and I can do, you know, lectures here and there just to talk to people about 5G and the threats of it.
[02:27:21.435 --> 02:27:30.042]  But I know a person that the doctor directly told him that, yeah, it was your cell phone use that gave you your brain tumor and he died, you know, a few months later.
[02:27:30.883 --> 02:27:34.105]  Um, and I know that this stuff is very dangerous.
[02:27:34.105 --> 02:27:41.328]  I mean, I have a flip phone for my business, and the thing that I'm probably most addicted to, as far as, like, screen time, is probably InfoWars.
[02:27:41.328 --> 02:27:45.650]  But how hard is it, though, as a business, you say you're a business owner?
[02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:46.750]  Yeah.
[02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:57.715]  How hard is it, though, as a business owner, to create a business model that can not just exist, but even thrive, trying to avoid the harmful technologies?
[02:27:59.161 --> 02:28:06.486]  Well, I mean, I use, well, you know, I use a router as far as my computer, but I know that there's Wi-Fi signals going through my house.
[02:28:06.486 --> 02:28:09.268]  I mean, I have, you know, I live in an apartment complex.
[02:28:09.268 --> 02:28:22.738]  And I also have a smart meter that I can tell you a few times when there's been a signal that, you know, they're doing a testing in the dead of night, and like, I'll hear my printer all of a sudden go on, I mean, whatever's being tested in the house, and it'll jolt me awake.
[02:28:23.362 --> 02:28:29.611]  I mean, these frequencies are active, they're far-reaching, and they do disturb the pineal gland.
[02:28:29.611 --> 02:28:36.521]  They do disturb... And you combine that with everything else, with the chemicals in the food and water, it's just like a perfect storm.
[02:28:36.521 --> 02:28:38.784]  Wow, Judy, first of all, thank you for quoting me!
[02:28:40.085 --> 02:28:41.507]  I'm blushing on air here.
[02:28:41.507 --> 02:28:42.267]  That was amazing.
[02:28:42.267 --> 02:28:44.670]  But you know, she makes a great point with the small business.
[02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:52.256]  It's like, I go to my barber and their wireless is down and they can't even take payments because they use the wireless service to charge the card.
[02:28:52.256 --> 02:28:53.898]  So it's like, can you even survive with it?
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.360]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.161]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:28:58.161 --> 02:28:59.802]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[02:29:02.623 --> 02:29:04.924]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[02:29:31.411 --> 02:29:36.732]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:29:36.732 --> 02:29:42.413]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:29:42.413 --> 02:29:45.854]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:29:45.854 --> 02:29:48.974]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[02:30:07.090 --> 02:30:15.839]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:30:15.959 --> 02:30:32.129]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.

[02:32:59.137 --> 02:33:01.759]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.744 --> 02:33:14.845]  You found it.
[02:33:14.845 --> 02:33:16.927]  The tip of the spear.
[02:33:16.927 --> 02:33:21.231]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:23.573 --> 02:33:32.801]  All right, before we get back to the phone lines with Leon and Joe and Dylan and Grant, I just want to do a quick news blitz here.
[02:33:32.801 --> 02:33:37.905]  California water law prevents showering doing laundry on same day.
[02:33:37.905 --> 02:33:49.635]  California Governor Jerry Brown signed two bills that will force water districts and municipalities to permanently adopt even more aggressive water rationing level than during the state's five-year drought.
[02:33:49.635 --> 02:33:51.617]  So, more government control in California.
[02:33:53.314 --> 02:34:05.580]  I wonder though, if Jerry Brown is able to water his plants, take a shower, make pasta, do his laundry, do it all on the same day.
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:13.404]  I wonder if Jerry Brown has to abide by the same water restrictions as the rest of California.
[02:34:13.404 --> 02:34:15.625]  Somehow I doubt it.
[02:34:15.625 --> 02:34:18.506]  Maybe I'm just a cynic.
[02:34:18.506 --> 02:34:19.207]  Did you see this?
[02:34:20.365 --> 02:34:27.191]  Maxine Waters plays to empty seats as only 10 Millennials show up to campaign event.
[02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:33.497]  Anti-Maxine... Guys, see if you can find the graphic that they made for this, the anti-Maxine graphic.
[02:34:33.497 --> 02:34:35.579]  Yeah, here's the B-roll, the crew has it.
[02:34:35.579 --> 02:34:39.882]  There's the... It's about 10 Millennials that show up to this event.
[02:34:39.882 --> 02:34:45.327]  And then there's Maxine Waters, which I gotta tell you, this is actually kind of a powerful footage.
[02:34:45.327 --> 02:34:45.527]  You know...
[02:34:47.861 --> 02:34:50.682]  You know, I've got a grandma, bless her heart.
[02:34:50.682 --> 02:34:52.842]  I love her dearly.
[02:34:52.842 --> 02:34:55.702]  My last grandparent that's still alive.
[02:34:55.702 --> 02:34:58.363]  And, you know, she's kind of, you know, she's short in stature.
[02:34:58.363 --> 02:35:00.863]  You know, usually your grandmothers end up pretty short in stature.
[02:35:00.863 --> 02:35:15.906]  But when you see Maxine, who pretends to be this powerful woman, who pretends to be this giant for civil rights, standing there like the smallest person, the littlest person in the crowd, not just physically, but mentally.
[02:35:17.827 --> 02:35:22.769]  When it comes to her integrity, when it comes to her honesty, that's what she's really the littlest in.
[02:35:22.769 --> 02:35:26.791]  She's really a shrimp when it comes to integrity and honesty.
[02:35:26.791 --> 02:35:32.234]  And then you have the kind of physical manifestation of that in this video, but I'm losing my track here.
[02:35:32.234 --> 02:35:43.580]  Ten people show up to a Maxine Waters event, ten people with organization, press releases, printouts, the whole nine.
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:46.041]  Please join us for the anti-Maxine
[02:35:47.219 --> 02:35:49.400]  Meet and greet!
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:52.301]  They announce it, big rollout.
[02:35:52.301 --> 02:35:53.041]  But guess what?
[02:35:53.041 --> 02:35:59.924]  InfoWars gives you a 24-hour notice for a Planned Parenthood protest.
[02:35:59.924 --> 02:36:02.625]  Just little old me, little old me!
[02:36:02.625 --> 02:36:07.907]  24 hours, Planned Parenthood protest, I get 30 people to show up.
[02:36:07.907 --> 02:36:13.730]  Not to see me, not to hear me lecture them, but to protest the baby killers of Planned Parenthood.
[02:36:15.287 --> 02:36:17.288]  Bernie Sanders at the airport!
[02:36:17.288 --> 02:36:18.428]  Nobody cares.
[02:36:18.428 --> 02:36:19.988]  Low energy.
[02:36:19.988 --> 02:36:22.469]  Looks like a total schlub.
[02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:27.070]  Can't even buy a comb for a nickel.
[02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:28.571]  A total hack.
[02:36:28.571 --> 02:36:30.271]  A total bum.
[02:36:30.271 --> 02:36:36.033]  Where his little bodyguard, or whatever this guy is, has more energy than he does!
[02:36:36.033 --> 02:36:38.894]  Sanders is just wavering around out there like a...
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:45.023]  Like a, what do they call the dust things that roll around?
[02:36:45.023 --> 02:36:45.864]  I can't even think about it now.
[02:36:45.864 --> 02:36:48.265]  And all the western cartoons and everything.
[02:36:48.265 --> 02:36:48.725]  He's one of those.
[02:36:48.725 --> 02:36:50.587]  He's like a dust mite.
[02:36:50.587 --> 02:36:52.108]  A tumbleweed!
[02:36:52.108 --> 02:36:56.050]  Bernie Sanders is like a tumbleweed, tumbling through the airport.
[02:36:56.050 --> 02:36:57.991]  No energy, no one cares.
[02:36:57.991 --> 02:37:01.214]  Maxine Waters gets ten people to show up for a highly publicized event.
[02:37:01.954 --> 02:37:04.037]  Folks, I'm not just saying this.
[02:37:04.037 --> 02:37:05.478]  We are bigger than them.
[02:37:05.478 --> 02:37:07.060]  Do you understand that?
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:09.643]  Infowars is bigger than Bernie Sanders.
[02:37:09.643 --> 02:37:12.266]  Infowars is bigger than Maxine Waters.
[02:37:12.266 --> 02:37:15.189]  These people are losers and they're losing.
[02:37:15.189 --> 02:37:18.233]  I'll move on.
[02:37:23.025 --> 02:37:31.688]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people show up to a Maxine Waters event!
[02:37:31.688 --> 02:37:34.289]  10!
[02:37:34.289 --> 02:37:36.430]  Nancy Pelosi on Supreme Court ruling.
[02:37:36.430 --> 02:37:42.292]  Bake that cake, Christians!
[02:37:42.292 --> 02:37:42.932]  Nancy Pelosi!
[02:37:47.185 --> 02:37:48.726]  Woman can't even think straight.
[02:37:48.726 --> 02:37:51.167]  But she just told you what it was all about.
[02:37:51.167 --> 02:37:56.369]  She just told you what was behind the entire gay cake story.
[02:37:56.369 --> 02:38:04.412]  It was all about attacking Christians and militant homosexual radicals saying, you better bake our cake, Christians!
[02:38:04.412 --> 02:38:06.873]  Just trying to shove it in their face.
[02:38:06.873 --> 02:38:11.075]  Well, the Supreme Court got wise to you and you lost 7-2.
[02:38:11.075 --> 02:38:15.097]  Koch brothers joined resistance, launched campaign against Trump tariffs.
[02:38:16.981 --> 02:38:32.064]  You know, this is an interesting story, but I'm a little confused by this because I read a story today that said David Koch was actually pretty much setting aside all his involvement in Koch Industries, citing health reasons.
[02:38:32.064 --> 02:38:39.065]  So, kind of conflicting stories there, so I'm not sure what the deal with that is.
[02:38:39.065 --> 02:38:43.866]  But to the left, who hates the Koch brothers, you'd think that they'd be like, oh wow, the Koch brothers hate Trump?
[02:38:43.866 --> 02:38:44.666]  Hmm, maybe I like Trump.
[02:38:46.567 --> 02:38:50.068]  Yeah, billionaire conservative donor Koch to retire from Koch Industries.
[02:38:50.068 --> 02:38:52.429]  So, I'm just trying to figure this out.
[02:38:52.429 --> 02:38:55.150]  They claim that he's fighting Trump, but he's claiming to retire.
[02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.850]  Okay.
[02:38:55.850 --> 02:38:59.852]  Kent State gun girl challenges David Hogg to an arm wrestling match.
[02:38:59.852 --> 02:39:00.572]  This is hilarious.
[02:39:00.572 --> 02:39:01.632]  Caitlin Bennett.
[02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:01.933]  Huge.
[02:39:01.933 --> 02:39:04.454]  I'm a big fan of Caitlin Bennett, by the way.
[02:39:04.454 --> 02:39:05.354]  She's got a real future.
[02:39:06.741 --> 02:39:13.005]  And she's not afraid of media outlets, unlike other activists that are like her, that were scared to come on InfoWars.
[02:39:13.005 --> 02:39:14.226]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:39:14.226 --> 02:39:16.268]  Well, I think I'd probably take Caitlin Bennett in that.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.140]  I saw David Hogg once.
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:27.622]  I said that he had a loose thread hanging out of his shirt sleeve.
[02:39:27.622 --> 02:39:29.963]  I didn't realize it was his arm.
[02:39:29.963 --> 02:39:34.605]  So, anyway, and then you had, what is this deal?
[02:39:34.605 --> 02:39:41.547]  Family of Stoneman Douglas student advocate David Hogg swatted at home, but apparently it was a prank swat thing?
[02:39:41.547 --> 02:39:43.068]  I don't know.
[02:39:43.068 --> 02:39:44.868]  I'm just reporting this to you.
[02:39:44.868 --> 02:39:46.209]  I didn't dive deep into this.
[02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:48.490]  There's really not many details even in this story.
[02:39:49.686 --> 02:39:53.008]  Um, so who knows, there's probably some angle that'll come from that.
[02:39:53.008 --> 02:39:55.230]  Alright, got through that stack of news, let's get to another phone call.
[02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:58.152]  Let's go to Leon in Oregon.
[02:39:58.152 --> 02:40:06.377]  Go ahead, Leon, we're talking about the rollout of the 5G technology, the smartphone that's killing our humanity, and what do we do to stop it?
[02:40:06.377 --> 02:40:07.038]  Go ahead, Leon.
[02:40:08.257 --> 02:40:14.665]  Good afternoon Owen, and good job fighting for the cause.
[02:40:14.665 --> 02:40:18.970]  If you don't mind, I'd like to give a quick shout out to Alex from Speak Out Radio.
[02:40:18.970 --> 02:40:19.671]  It's been a long time.
[02:40:24.944 --> 02:40:29.647]  Uh, don't worry about your use of it because your use of it is as a tool for your work.
[02:40:29.647 --> 02:40:32.569]  You're not like sitting around watching porn and playing games.
[02:40:32.569 --> 02:40:34.670]  Yeah, no, I understand that.
[02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:36.591]  And I do understand that.
[02:40:36.591 --> 02:40:38.993]  However, it still is hurting me.
[02:40:38.993 --> 02:40:41.074]  I mean, I'm still getting negative health effects.
[02:40:42.196 --> 02:40:43.237]  Well, and you know what?
[02:40:43.237 --> 02:40:51.201]  Honestly, they've got us tied so tight into this system that to find information, I mean, you know, they're eliminating libraries all over the place.
[02:40:51.201 --> 02:40:54.083]  That used to be a huge source of information.
[02:40:54.083 --> 02:40:59.626]  Oh, wait, you mean like the Obama library that doesn't even have any books in it that's now getting protested in Chicago?
[02:40:59.626 --> 02:41:00.767]  Oh.
[02:41:00.767 --> 02:41:05.830]  Well, yeah, pretty much libraries nowadays just have a bunch of computers that are all hooked up to the internet anyway.
[02:41:06.778 --> 02:41:31.134]  But, you know, to find really good information is a really difficult thing to do, but if people do the homework and look at, you know, the things that companies put out about their technology and this and that, and that's really my main point here, is educate, you know, yourself about these type of technologies, and the more that you understand about this stuff, the more passionate you become, because you understand the goal of this stuff,
[02:41:31.664 --> 02:41:45.968]  You know, if DNA is manipulated by environmental circumstance, then all this stuff that we're putting on us is literally rearranging our cosmic antenna and, you know, preventing us from receiving, you know, like, creator energy and all that stuff.
[02:41:45.968 --> 02:41:50.329]  And the thing that I do, because I don't have access like you guys with a great audience,
[02:41:50.851 --> 02:41:56.514]  But if you're, like, standing at a gas pump, and you see somebody next to you, strike up a conversation.
[02:41:56.514 --> 02:42:09.662]  Start talking about this stuff, because the only way that we're going to be able to beat this stuff is by educating yourself, becoming passionate, and going out and talking to your friends and your neighbors, you know, your fellow citizen, about the stuff that's being put on us.
[02:42:09.662 --> 02:42:12.164]  And this is not a partisan issue, either.
[02:42:12.164 --> 02:42:13.805]  This is something that affects everybody.
[02:42:13.805 --> 02:42:15.866]  Nobody's really playing this as a left-right issue.
[02:42:16.533 --> 02:42:17.815]  Yeah, this is a human issue.
[02:42:17.815 --> 02:42:24.683]  This is about us as human beings and our safety and security in our own country, our own, you know, our own homes.
[02:42:24.683 --> 02:42:30.290]  Because like you guys say, the radio waves that are flying around nowadays are bad enough.
[02:42:30.290 --> 02:42:33.114]  With the implementation of the G5 and the
[02:42:33.439 --> 02:42:36.841]  You know, they've had the Gwin transmitters out for many, many years.
[02:42:36.841 --> 02:42:44.185]  You might remember the Gwin transmitters that were alleged to be able to manipulate people's attitudes over huge ranges of an area.
[02:42:44.185 --> 02:42:46.206]  And they already have those technologies.
[02:42:46.206 --> 02:42:52.189]  I mean, and that's like, that's like a whole other wing of this discussion that the population really doesn't even know about that you could have.
[02:42:55.071 --> 02:42:58.675]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:58.675 --> 02:43:00.457]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:43:00.457 --> 02:43:11.728]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.489 --> 02:43:21.691]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.691 --> 02:43:27.633]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:43:27.633 --> 02:43:32.734]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.734 --> 02:43:35.354]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.354 --> 02:43:37.075]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.075 --> 02:43:41.876]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:43:42.096 --> 02:43:47.060]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:49.702]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.702 --> 02:43:55.227]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:43:55.227 --> 02:44:01.492]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by Infowarslife.
[02:44:02.353 --> 02:44:15.441]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[02:44:15.441 --> 02:44:25.928]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[02:44:33.892 --> 02:44:48.541]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:44:48.541 --> 02:44:51.222]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:44:59.944 --> 02:45:05.687]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:05.687 --> 02:45:13.550]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:16.712]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:16.872 --> 02:45:22.156]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:45:22.156 --> 02:45:24.938]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:45:24.938 --> 02:45:33.925]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:45:34.085 --> 02:45:45.952]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:45:45.952 --> 02:45:50.755]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:50.755 --> 02:45:52.416]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:55.828 --> 02:46:01.413]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[02:46:01.413 --> 02:46:02.294]  It'd take hours.
[02:46:02.294 --> 02:46:04.716]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:46:04.716 --> 02:46:05.897]  It's stronger.
[02:46:05.897 --> 02:46:07.519]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:46:07.519 --> 02:46:10.742]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:46:10.742 --> 02:46:11.863]  It's back in stock.
[02:46:11.863 --> 02:46:15.046]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.046 --> 02:46:18.369]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:18.809 --> 02:46:18.889]  Yes.
[02:46:37.592 --> 02:46:39.353]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:13.667 --> 02:47:18.468]  Well, you have seen the viral video of Alex Jones confronting Bernie Sanders at the airport.
[02:47:40.430 --> 02:47:47.472]  Now, we reported on it and showed you the footage of Bernie Sanders running from Alex Jones, refusing to answer a question.
[02:47:47.472 --> 02:48:02.515]  But now, we're honored, as you're watching the video right now for TV viewers at Infowars.com slash show, most of our audience is radio, you're seeing Bernie Sanders freaking out when he sees Alex looking like a crumbum.
[02:48:02.515 --> 02:48:08.697]  You guys aren't playing first class, are you?
[02:48:08.697 --> 02:48:09.217]  Why is he running?
[02:48:14.079 --> 02:48:16.620]  You guys find first class, you shouldn't be.
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:17.741]  I got a coach ticket in my pocket.
[02:48:17.741 --> 02:48:19.102]  They don't do that in Venezuela.
[02:48:19.102 --> 02:48:20.963]  I like his $100,000 alimony.
[02:48:20.963 --> 02:48:22.083]  I'm gonna walk this way.
[02:48:22.083 --> 02:48:24.025]  The entrance is over here.
[02:48:24.025 --> 02:48:29.828]  Look, look, right there.
[02:48:29.828 --> 02:48:32.469]  Ernie, why'd you say white people don't know what's like before?
[02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.889]  Don't touch me.
[02:48:32.889 --> 02:48:34.410]  Alex, don't touch me.
[02:48:34.410 --> 02:48:35.651]  Don't touch me, Alex.
[02:48:35.651 --> 02:48:37.452]  You guys have fun.
[02:48:37.452 --> 02:48:39.053]  Gotta be around the general public, huh?
[02:48:39.053 --> 02:48:40.954]  It's kind of a bad thing.
[02:48:42.130 --> 02:48:43.570]  You're on the proletariat like that?
[02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:45.731]  You're a ruling class commie?
[02:48:45.731 --> 02:48:52.612]  Huh?
[02:48:52.612 --> 02:48:53.993]  So there's Bernie running from Alex.
[02:48:53.993 --> 02:48:55.193]  You're having fun.
[02:48:55.193 --> 02:48:55.853]  We're all having fun.
[02:48:55.853 --> 02:48:56.673]  There's the footage.
[02:48:56.673 --> 02:48:57.273]  We're gonna win.
[02:48:57.273 --> 02:48:57.574]  Don't worry.
[02:48:57.574 --> 02:48:59.694]  Merrick's coming back.
[02:48:59.694 --> 02:49:02.575]  His little minion.
[02:49:02.575 --> 02:49:04.955]  Just look at the slobberly behavior of a Bernie Sanders.
[02:49:04.955 --> 02:49:05.975]  Doesn't even comb his hair.
[02:49:05.975 --> 02:49:07.096]  Walks like a crumbum.
[02:49:07.096 --> 02:49:07.876]  God bless you.
[02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:15.242]  Mr. Sanders, why do you think socialism works better than capitalism?
[02:49:15.242 --> 02:49:18.224]  And why do you live in a capitalist country?
[02:49:18.224 --> 02:49:20.985]  I don't know why you're running from me.
[02:49:20.985 --> 02:49:23.646]  Will you apologize for all the wars you guys launched, the Democrats?
[02:49:23.646 --> 02:49:25.666]  All the millions you killed?
[02:49:25.666 --> 02:49:30.308]  Do you enjoy living in your million-dollar vacation houses, Bernie?
[02:49:30.308 --> 02:49:31.429]  Or do you want to give those to people?
[02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:37.631]  Yeah, your $100,000 Audis?
[02:49:37.631 --> 02:49:39.392]  Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[02:49:39.392 --> 02:49:40.132]  You guys have fun.
[02:49:42.577 --> 02:49:46.120]  We love reporting on all that money.
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.603]  You guys run your little PR stuff.
[02:49:49.603 --> 02:49:54.868]  It's not gonna work.
[02:49:54.868 --> 02:49:56.009]  Have fun, you know.
[02:49:56.009 --> 02:50:00.413]  Good luck when Google gets broken up.
[02:50:00.413 --> 02:50:02.855]  Hey Bernie, why'd you say white people don't know what it's like before?
[02:50:02.855 --> 02:50:04.276]  Why are you so racist?
[02:50:04.276 --> 02:50:07.159]  I won't answer that, but he did say it.
[02:50:08.152 --> 02:50:09.573]  Move to Venezuela, Bernie.
[02:50:09.573 --> 02:50:10.334]  You'll like it.
[02:50:10.334 --> 02:50:13.237]  People like you there.
[02:50:13.237 --> 02:50:14.178]  So there's the footage.
[02:50:14.178 --> 02:50:15.279]  I mean, it's right there.
[02:50:15.279 --> 02:50:17.360]  Bernie Sanders refuses to answer a question.
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:28.711]  He's running away from Alex Jones, the great communist Bernie Sanders, total fraud, let Hillary steal the election, lives in million dollar mansions, fancy cars, but claims he's a socialist.
[02:50:28.711 --> 02:50:31.273]  But Bernie was so upset that we
[02:50:32.714 --> 02:50:36.155]  Reported on him refusing to talk to Alex Jones, running from Alex Jones.
[02:50:36.155 --> 02:50:38.356]  He was so upset that now we're honored.
[02:50:38.356 --> 02:50:39.837]  Bernie has called into the show.
[02:50:39.837 --> 02:50:41.097]  I mean, I can't believe this is happening.
[02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:46.799]  So now Bernie Sanders has called into the show to defend his honor after running from Alex Jones like a coward.
[02:50:46.799 --> 02:50:51.481]  So, uh, uh, Bernie, you're claiming you didn't run from Alex Jones when he was talking to you?
[02:50:51.481 --> 02:50:52.821]  I mean, we had the footage, Bernie.
[02:50:52.821 --> 02:50:54.402]  I mean, how are you, what are you saying?
[02:50:54.402 --> 02:50:55.482]  You didn't run from Alex Jones?
[02:50:57.328 --> 02:50:59.049]  I did not run from that man.
[02:50:59.049 --> 02:51:01.091]  In fact, that's all fake news.
[02:51:01.091 --> 02:51:02.592]  Fake, fake footage.
[02:51:02.592 --> 02:51:08.397]  Just like Venezuela has the highest GDP in the world, and they're doing great.
[02:51:08.397 --> 02:51:14.002]  And I like Black Lives Matter, and you know, again, again, white
[02:51:23.847 --> 02:51:27.090]  They don't know!
[02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:32.615]  Continuing, I just wanted to say that since the report was put out, it's fake news, okay?
[02:51:32.615 --> 02:51:36.138]  And the economy's not coming back under Trump.
[02:51:36.138 --> 02:51:39.000]  It's been a nightmare!
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:48.108]  And yes, my wife took over Burlington College, and then bankrupted it and took millions, but that's not a big deal, because she was my second wife.
[02:51:49.145 --> 02:51:55.732]  And to where we honeymooned in the Soviet Union when I was the mayor of Burlington as part of a program.
[02:51:55.732 --> 02:52:03.319]  And it used to be a great country where you could go there and we taught the Christians how to get on their damn knees.
[02:52:03.319 --> 02:52:07.843]  So I just wanted to call and say I would never run for one of you filthy Americans.
[02:52:07.843 --> 02:52:09.005]  And I didn't run for them.
[02:52:09.005 --> 02:52:12.168]  And we're gonna get you and we got your kids in the school.
[02:52:13.015 --> 02:52:13.475]  Well, Bernie,
[02:52:58.826 --> 02:53:02.329]  He's a man of courage, incredibly intelligent.
[02:53:02.329 --> 02:53:06.113]  It's Pope Francis the Jesuit, because he's not a Christian.
[02:53:06.113 --> 02:53:10.317]  He's doing more to wreck Christianity than anyone's done in thousands of years.
[02:53:10.317 --> 02:53:15.602]  And I think it's beautiful that we've almost broken Western civilization's back.
[02:53:15.602 --> 02:53:18.525]  So don't you ever try to put me down.
[02:53:18.525 --> 02:53:19.606]  You understand that, boy?
[02:53:20.737 --> 02:53:22.378]  It doesn't matter that I never had a private sector job.
[02:53:22.378 --> 02:53:24.839]  When I was born in Brooklyn, I was anointed.
[02:53:24.839 --> 02:53:27.741]  It's like my brother moved to England to run things there.
[02:53:54.597 --> 02:54:09.806]  I'm going to show you I am better than you.
[02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:18.731]  That's why Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook and all the billionaires with hundreds of billions apiece, that's why they're tax exempt.
[02:54:18.731 --> 02:54:20.031]  It's why they pay no tax.
[02:54:24.881 --> 02:54:29.743]  Bernie, if I gave you a nickel right now for a comb, would you would you comb your hair?
[02:54:51.937 --> 02:54:54.718]  I love my little Einstein look, okay?
[02:54:54.718 --> 02:54:59.040]  So, but you don't think I don't like to look like a little harmless old man?
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:04.342]  When us communists have killed 185 million people, we wish it was a lot more.
[02:55:04.342 --> 02:55:09.885]  Here's the thing, we're doing it right now in China and the big churches.
[02:55:09.885 --> 02:55:11.125]  We control them in the U.S.
[02:55:11.125 --> 02:55:12.426]  now and we're killing
[02:55:17.592 --> 02:55:19.093]  They like it.
[02:55:19.093 --> 02:55:21.214]  They like what we're doing.
[02:55:21.214 --> 02:55:22.814]  We run your family.
[02:55:22.814 --> 02:55:25.955]  Your children are ours.
[02:55:25.955 --> 02:55:28.276]  You will never stop me, Owen.
[02:55:28.276 --> 02:55:33.418]  And as Alex Jones, our forces are already rallying.
[02:55:33.418 --> 02:55:35.179]  And we will take you down.
[02:55:35.179 --> 02:55:37.419]  And we will fry you with 5G.
[02:55:37.419 --> 02:55:40.820]  And we will fry you with GMO and fluoride.
[02:55:58.210 --> 02:56:01.153]  Just like the Soviet Union.
[02:56:01.153 --> 02:56:02.534]  I'm so close.
[02:56:02.534 --> 02:56:04.897]  Oh God, I'm just starting to wake up.
[02:56:04.897 --> 02:56:06.598]  Oh, I'm going to push back.
[02:56:06.598 --> 02:56:08.160]  Oh, I'm here.
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:09.461]  Oh, Jesus.
[02:56:09.461 --> 02:56:10.442]  I want to hide.
[02:56:10.442 --> 02:56:11.203]  I hate America.
[02:56:11.946 --> 02:56:12.446]  You listen to me!
[02:56:12.446 --> 02:56:15.267]  Hillary was the anointed one to drive a wedge between men and women even more!
[02:56:15.267 --> 02:56:16.107]  And so, when they took the election
[02:56:53.932 --> 02:56:54.893]  We're good to go.
[02:57:20.034 --> 02:57:22.136]  We're gonna piss all over everything.
[02:57:22.136 --> 02:57:25.198]  You don't say Jesus even in school.
[02:57:25.198 --> 02:57:26.620]  You don't talk about it.
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:30.723]  You keep your dirty American Christian Bible quiet.
[02:57:30.723 --> 02:57:32.364]  Is that clear?
[02:57:32.364 --> 02:57:34.186]  Is that clear to you, Owen?
[02:57:34.986 --> 02:57:39.970]  There it is, the scumbag dirtbag Bernie Sanders calls into the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:39.970 --> 02:57:41.431]  You know, I'll give you credit, Bernie.
[02:57:41.431 --> 02:57:43.773]  You ran from Alex then, but you'll call in from a phone.
[02:57:43.773 --> 02:57:44.674]  We still got your kids.
[02:57:44.674 --> 02:57:45.995]  We still got your kids in the school.
[02:57:45.995 --> 02:57:48.897]  Community independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:57:48.897 --> 02:57:56.904]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[02:57:56.904 --> 02:57:59.426]  With InfoWars Life Select storable food,

[02:58:46.141 --> 02:58:53.089]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[02:58:53.089 --> 02:58:55.611]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[02:58:55.611 --> 02:58:59.836]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[02:58:59.836 --> 02:59:01.878]  And the world is taking notice.

[02:59:26.627 --> 02:59:28.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.546 --> 03:00:06.287]  Okay, well, Bernie Sanders has actually decided to stick around with us here.
[03:00:06.287 --> 03:00:15.529]  Now, I'll tell you that in the break, like a good Socialist, like a good Democrat Socialist, Bernie Sanders decided to insult my mother and then my family.
[03:00:15.529 --> 03:00:21.270]  So, not shocking at that rhetoric from Bernie Sanders, insulting my family there in the middle of the break, but he wanted to come back on.
[03:00:21.270 --> 03:00:29.671]  So, Bernie, I'm just curious, you supported Black Lives Matter, you supported them after even the cop killings, and you praised them.
[03:00:29.671 --> 03:00:31.952]  So, I'm just curious, Bernie, do you want more dead cops?
[03:00:33.035 --> 03:00:35.739]  First of all, shut your dirty Christian mouth, okay?
[03:00:35.739 --> 03:00:38.343]  I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[03:00:38.343 --> 03:00:43.030]  The word mother, the word father is being removed in Canada, Europe, and here.
[03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:44.433]  It's a hateful word!
[03:00:45.652 --> 03:00:54.379]  It's a hateful, evil word, and we're teaching the children now, in sex education nationwide, how being heterosexual is bad.
[03:00:54.379 --> 03:00:58.103]  And I agree with that whole agenda, and I think that's a good thing.
[03:00:58.103 --> 03:01:04.748]  Now, actually again, I saw an article in the Philadelphia newspaper just a few days ago celebrating that.
[03:01:04.748 --> 03:01:07.050]  I heard Alex Jones is going to be covering it a little bit later.
[03:01:07.050 --> 03:01:11.394]  But first, I want to explain something to me, you little rat.
[03:01:11.394 --> 03:01:12.214]  You little slave.
[03:01:13.726 --> 03:01:20.651]  Black Lives Matter is revolutionary, standing up against the oppression of the ruling class.
[03:01:20.651 --> 03:01:33.019]  It's just like CNN said, that if a cop kills somebody, questionably, in one part of the country, and then officers get shot in another part who are totally innocent, well, they're not innocent.
[03:01:33.019 --> 03:01:34.580]  And that's not an outrageous message.
[03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:36.561]  That's officially what we, the Communist Party,
[03:01:39.607 --> 03:01:42.590]  Oh, and just get ready for it.
[03:01:42.590 --> 03:01:44.471]  Get ready for it.
[03:01:44.471 --> 03:01:50.717]  As soon as we get your guns, we're going to have a way with you.
[03:01:50.717 --> 03:01:53.519]  Bernie, we always come for the guns.
[03:01:53.519 --> 03:01:56.721]  Then offshore banks suck the country dry.
[03:01:56.721 --> 03:01:58.803]  Bernie, didn't Hitler come for the guns, Bernie?
[03:01:58.803 --> 03:02:03.087]  I mean, didn't Hitler come for the guns and then your Jewish ancestors?
[03:02:03.087 --> 03:02:06.970]  Okay, all Christians, all conservatives,
[03:02:09.475 --> 03:02:10.236]  I think so.
[03:02:34.807 --> 03:02:39.288]  As I was saying, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:02:39.288 --> 03:02:41.769]  And you're going to find out about that real soon.
[03:03:01.014 --> 03:03:09.000]  The problem is it can't work when there's still any freedom, I mean, racism going on.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:15.445]  You need to let us, the big mega banks, run and rule everything, and then we will take really good care of you.
[03:03:15.445 --> 03:03:23.790]  It's totally normal that the Fortune 100, big banks, and big tech give almost 100% Democrat money and have been tax exempt.
[03:03:27.651 --> 03:03:28.532]  We're good to go.
[03:03:53.012 --> 03:03:53.772]  We're good to go.
[03:04:11.099 --> 03:04:16.780]  No, say to me, say to me, the Cookie Monster.
[03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:18.801]  I am the Cookie Monster.
[03:04:18.801 --> 03:04:20.621]  I am Bernie Sanders.
[03:04:20.621 --> 03:04:22.281]  You will die.
[03:04:22.281 --> 03:04:24.522]  You will give everything to me.
[03:04:24.522 --> 03:04:25.802]  No, I don't think so, Bernie.
[03:04:25.802 --> 03:04:28.583]  I think that people like you are going to jail, Bernie.
[03:04:28.583 --> 03:04:30.703]  We will break your will.
[03:04:30.703 --> 03:04:31.503]  No, Bernie.
[03:04:31.503 --> 03:04:34.244]  Your wife is being investigated by the FBI right now, Bernie.
[03:04:36.232 --> 03:04:39.616]  No, no, no, Venezuela, communism is collapsing, Bernie.
[03:04:39.616 --> 03:04:39.957]  No, no.
[03:04:39.957 --> 03:04:42.140]  They can't even get a comb for a nickel in Venezuela, Bernie.
[03:04:52.833 --> 03:04:58.198]  Living in a volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.198 --> 03:05:01.501]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.501 --> 03:05:07.766]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.766 --> 03:05:10.528]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:15.074]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.074 --> 03:05:21.561]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.561 --> 03:05:26.527]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.268 --> 03:05:31.191]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.191 --> 03:05:38.396]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.396 --> 03:05:43.620]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:49.304]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:53.287]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:04.403 --> 03:06:11.448]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:11.448 --> 03:06:16.591]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:16.591 --> 03:06:17.712]  We are live.
[03:06:17.712 --> 03:06:24.156]  It is the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show on this June 5th, 2018 edition.
[03:06:24.156 --> 03:06:26.018]  Got a host of issues to get into.
[03:06:26.018 --> 03:06:29.240]  Some positive news, in fact a lot of positive news today.
[03:06:29.910 --> 03:06:35.033]  Starting off with one of the top headlines on Infowars.com right now.
[03:06:35.033 --> 03:06:35.693]  Poll.
[03:06:35.693 --> 03:06:42.456]  Double the amount of Americans think young black people doing better under Trump than Obama.
[03:06:42.456 --> 03:06:43.196]  That's right.
[03:06:43.196 --> 03:06:49.279]  Donald Trump is proving once again to be a very, very bad racist indeed.
[03:06:49.279 --> 03:06:59.064]  This is a new poll out of Rasmussen and it's found that double, double the number of Americans think that young black people are doing better under Trump than they did under Obama.
[03:06:59.784 --> 03:07:13.519]  Now if you look at these figures it's pretty interesting because while 36% still say that life for young black people in America is worse, 32% said that it's got better under Trump compared to Obama.
[03:07:13.519 --> 03:07:17.323]  Now you look at Obama's figures, compare this to Obama's figures from March 2014.
[03:07:19.434 --> 03:07:29.756]  Where just 16% of Americans said that life had gotten better for young blacks under Obama, and by July 2016 this number had slumped to just 13%.
[03:07:29.756 --> 03:07:39.598]  So it was less than half under the Obama administration compared to the Trump administration that thought young black people in America were doing well.
[03:07:39.598 --> 03:07:47.220]  Now people are going to look at these figures and say, oh this is just racist bigoted Trump voters saying that life is better for black people.
[03:07:47.220 --> 03:07:47.920]  How would they know?
[03:07:48.945 --> 03:08:05.810]  Well no, that's not the case, because as Rasmussen reports, even black voters are nearly twice as likely, 28%, to say young black Americans are better off now than they were in the closing year of Obama's presidency, which was 15%.
[03:08:05.810 --> 03:08:08.691]  So no, it's not just Trump voters who are skewing these polls.
[03:08:09.682 --> 03:08:18.929]  Almost double the number of black voters say the exact same thing, that life has gotten better for young black people in Trump's America.
[03:08:18.929 --> 03:08:23.973]  Trump, the bigoted racist America, compared to Obama's America.
[03:08:23.973 --> 03:08:31.519]  Now it's not really a big surprise, is it, given the economic numbers, given the black unemployment numbers.
[03:08:31.519 --> 03:08:32.300]  Now of course this is
[03:08:33.191 --> 03:08:41.157]  Made even more impressive by the fact that, as we know, the mainstream media has been attempting to smear Trump as a racist bigot for the best part of the last two years.
[03:08:41.157 --> 03:08:54.347]  The Trump derangement syndrome has run rampant, even though Trump was largely seen before he ran as a Republican as very beneficial towards the black community, did a lot of charity work.
[03:08:54.347 --> 03:08:58.791]  He was even name-dropped in numerous rap songs by numerous hip-hop artists.
[03:08:58.791 --> 03:09:01.333]  He was seen as a friend to the black community.
[03:09:02.679 --> 03:09:07.822]  Before he ran as a Republican and then he's a bigoted racist, he's literally Hitler.
[03:09:07.822 --> 03:09:17.308]  So again, we have this situation where, you know, Obama was brought in, he was heralded as the leader of a new era of positive race relations.
[03:09:17.308 --> 03:09:19.949]  And yet, what was going on when he left office?
[03:09:19.949 --> 03:09:23.031]  And in the year before he left office, we had the riots.
[03:09:23.718 --> 03:09:24.478]  In Ferguson.
[03:09:24.478 --> 03:09:26.119]  We had the riots in Baltimore.
[03:09:26.119 --> 03:09:43.468]  We had the emergence of a Black Lives Matter movement that chanted for dead cops, that soured race relations across the board, that anointed as its hero, let's not forget, an actual cop killer, Assata Shakur, who was on the FBI's most wanted domestic terrorist list.
[03:09:43.468 --> 03:09:46.710]  So that was Obama's accomplishment.
[03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:48.731]  Unfulfilled promises.
[03:09:48.731 --> 03:09:49.431]  Trump came in
[03:09:49.758 --> 03:09:55.282]  He offered and he delivered on his promise, which was, of course, mainly the jobs issue.
[03:09:55.282 --> 03:10:01.566]  As we saw last week, there you see Assata Shakur, who is still, by the way, a fugitive.
[03:10:01.566 --> 03:10:03.127]  They're still hunting for her.
[03:10:03.127 --> 03:10:07.169]  I think she was in exile in Cuba the last time anyone heard of her.
[03:10:07.169 --> 03:10:15.935]  Literally involved in murdering police officers, and that's who Black Lives Matter leaders invoke and worship at every single event.
[03:10:16.636 --> 03:10:20.898]  That's the great soothing race relations that Obama brought to America.
[03:10:20.898 --> 03:10:30.682]  Because last week we found out that black unemployment hit its lowest level since the government started to record the data in 1972.
[03:10:30.682 --> 03:10:36.745]  That black unemployment level now stands at just 5.9%.
[03:10:36.745 --> 03:10:41.727]  So again, Donald Trump is proving to be a very, very poor racist.
[03:10:41.727 --> 03:10:44.468]  In fact, we just had news about 10 minutes ago, which I tweeted,
[03:10:46.601 --> 03:10:55.304]  Breaking noted racist Donald Trump to consider pardoning black woman Alice Marie Johnson who was jailed for life for a first-time drug offense.
[03:10:55.304 --> 03:10:59.205]  Of course this came as a result of the meeting with Kim Kardashian.
[03:10:59.205 --> 03:11:04.087]  Now Trump is considering pardoning Alice Marie Johnson.
[03:11:04.087 --> 03:11:08.668]  Remember there was the famous boxer a couple of weeks ago that he also pardoned.
[03:11:08.668 --> 03:11:11.089]  Again another African-American.
[03:11:11.089 --> 03:11:16.211]  So again Donald Trump not performing too well in terms of being a racist.
[03:11:17.071 --> 03:11:28.038]  Of course, we had his meeting with Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk just about a week ago, following Kanye West's public praise for the pro-Trump activist.
[03:11:28.038 --> 03:11:29.939]  And again, what did the polls show after that?
[03:11:29.939 --> 03:11:31.861]  We had the report last month.
[03:11:31.861 --> 03:11:39.726]  Support for Trump amongst black males in the week after Kanye West praised Candace Owens doubled
[03:11:41.135 --> 03:11:42.416]  It doubled!
[03:11:42.416 --> 03:11:48.241]  How big is that going to be as we approach 2020 with Trump going for re-election?
[03:11:48.241 --> 03:11:52.064]  Absolutely massive!
[03:11:52.064 --> 03:12:00.691]  And if these unemployment levels can remain as low or even lower as they've ever been, Trump is going to pick up more support amongst African Americans.
[03:12:00.691 --> 03:12:04.374]  Of course, he's never going to pick up anywhere near a majority of support.
[03:12:05.481 --> 03:12:10.343]  Because they're on the plantation and very much kept there, which is why they fear Candace Owens so much.
[03:12:10.343 --> 03:12:17.966]  In fact, today she tweeted that she's probably thinking about running for political office somewhere in the not-too-distant future.
[03:12:17.966 --> 03:12:28.770]  And that is going to absolutely terrify them, because as the polls proved, this is actually getting through to black people, specifically getting through to young black people.
[03:12:28.770 --> 03:12:31.211]  And now we see across the board, across America,
[03:12:32.682 --> 03:12:44.070]  And amongst the African-American community, they see life as being better for their community under Trump compared to under Obama, in numbers that are basically doubled.
[03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:48.132]  That is huge, that is massive as we head towards these midterms.
[03:12:48.132 --> 03:12:52.035]  Now this is not in a vacuum, let's not forget.
[03:12:52.035 --> 03:12:58.379]  Given their obsession with identity politics, the Democrats have left thought they would recover from the 2016 election.
[03:12:58.379 --> 03:12:58.819]  They haven't.
[03:12:59.958 --> 03:13:05.623]  Millennial support for Democrats is down 9 percentage points since 2016.
[03:13:05.623 --> 03:13:08.485]  They haven't picked up anything and in fact they've lost.
[03:13:08.485 --> 03:13:10.907]  They've lost their advantage in terms of the midterms.
[03:13:10.907 --> 03:13:17.773]  Remember, back in December, what was it, they had a 13 point lead on Republicans.
[03:13:17.773 --> 03:13:21.215]  Now you see Democrats losing support of Millennials.
[03:13:21.215 --> 03:13:23.097]  We had obviously Owen earlier talking about
[03:13:23.849 --> 03:13:31.714]  Mad Maxine Waters and her handful of Millennials that showed up for her event, which was specifically tailored for Millennials.
[03:13:31.714 --> 03:13:37.077]  They had 10 people in that category show up.
[03:13:37.077 --> 03:13:39.579]  So their message just does not resonate.
[03:13:39.579 --> 03:13:41.500]  They were 13 points ahead.
[03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:45.682]  Who's talking about a blue wave now?
[03:13:45.682 --> 03:13:47.223]  Who's talking about a blue wave?
[03:13:47.223 --> 03:13:47.644]  Nobody.
[03:13:47.644 --> 03:13:48.584]  It's collapsed.
[03:13:48.584 --> 03:13:53.347]  Latest polls show the race for Congress is within the margin of error.
[03:13:54.025 --> 03:14:06.029]  And it's no doubt partly because of black Americans, their lives have immeasurably improved, as have the lives of many because of the economic numbers under Donald Trump.
[03:14:06.029 --> 03:14:08.650]  So this is going to be huge going forward.
[03:14:08.650 --> 03:14:11.530]  And what do the media have in response?
[03:14:11.530 --> 03:14:15.572]  Again, every single day, oh, the White House is in a constitutional crisis.
[03:14:15.572 --> 03:14:19.933]  It's either that or it's some bizarre, obsessive distraction.
[03:14:19.933 --> 03:14:22.114]  Like now we have Melania Trump.
[03:14:22.114 --> 03:14:23.054]  She has serious
[03:14:23.649 --> 03:14:29.752]  Kidney, a serious kidney operation, which other people have commented who've had similar operations.
[03:14:29.752 --> 03:14:32.133]  It's put them out of action for two months.
[03:14:32.133 --> 03:14:33.974]  She's been gone, what, about three weeks?
[03:14:33.974 --> 03:14:37.556]  I mean, she's appeared in public days ago.
[03:14:37.556 --> 03:14:42.559]  But now she's been gone from, you know, public events where she's on camera for about three weeks.
[03:14:42.559 --> 03:14:50.102]  They've woven conspiracy theories about her, about Donald Trump, like being in a fight with her or her leaving the country.
[03:14:50.102 --> 03:14:51.343]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:14:51.343 --> 03:14:53.364]  Remember, these are the same people.
[03:14:54.324 --> 03:15:11.175]  Who said that we, in the case of CNN's Brian Stelter, were reckless conspiracy theorists because we pointed at Hillary Clinton as she coughed and stumbled her way through the campaign trail and said maybe there's something wrong with her, maybe she has some kind of health issue.
[03:15:11.175 --> 03:15:14.318]  We were reckless conspiracy theorists for doing that.
[03:15:14.318 --> 03:15:22.203]  Now Melania Trump has a serious kidney operation, she rests up for a couple of weeks, she's back in public life basically now, but they're still
[03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:31.825]  On with this crazy conspiracy theory that she's invisible, she's disappeared, or that Donald Trump got in a physical fist fight with her.
[03:15:31.825 --> 03:15:35.968]  We're conspiracy theorists, we're reckless for doing that with Hillary, with actual evidence.
[03:15:35.968 --> 03:15:42.512]  When Melania has a serious kidney operation, oh, that's serious journalism to frame it, to talk about it in that context.
[03:15:42.512 --> 03:15:44.793]  Absolutely incredible double standards.
[03:15:44.793 --> 03:15:47.195]  We'll be back on the other side to talk about it more.
[03:15:47.195 --> 03:15:49.696]  This is the Alex... Wars.com.
[03:15:49.696 --> 03:15:50.417]  We'll be back.
[03:15:53.368 --> 03:15:55.269]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:19:00.049 --> 03:19:01.470]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:19:01.470 --> 03:19:05.094]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:19:05.094 --> 03:19:13.842]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:19:13.962 --> 03:19:30.113]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[03:19:30.613 --> 03:19:39.216]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:19:39.216 --> 03:19:44.118]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:19:44.118 --> 03:19:49.719]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:19:57.668 --> 03:20:01.649]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:01.649 --> 03:20:07.111]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:07.111 --> 03:20:08.952]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:08.952 --> 03:20:11.773]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:20.834 --> 03:20:35.682]  We are back live on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show talking about positive news today because I've just spoke about the poll where double the amount of Americans think that young black people in America are doing better under Trump than under Obama.
[03:20:35.682 --> 03:20:41.905]  We also have positive news out of Italy which has the globalists very concerned indeed.
[03:20:41.905 --> 03:20:49.049]  We're going to go to that clip here in a moment but first I want to tell you about the Memorial Day blowout special which we're still running
[03:20:49.854 --> 03:20:51.736]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:20:51.736 --> 03:20:57.601]  This is free shipping and up to 50, that's five zero percent off your favorite products.
[03:20:57.601 --> 03:21:01.824]  Now again, I've spoken about this on many previous occasions.
[03:21:01.824 --> 03:21:10.771]  We're not subject to the kind of boycott campaigns that hit, that impact other big conservative news outlets like Breitbart or Fox News for example.
[03:21:10.771 --> 03:21:16.616]  We're not subject to that, we're not vulnerable to that because all our products are of course sold in-house.
[03:21:16.616 --> 03:21:17.537]  We're only reliant on
[03:21:18.413 --> 03:21:27.641]  We're only dependent on you, the listener, the viewer, which is why we really appreciate you getting these products to fund this network.
[03:21:27.641 --> 03:21:36.468]  Now again, we're continuing the specials from Memorial Day, where we dropped the prices to unprecedented levels on new and old favorite products.
[03:21:36.468 --> 03:21:38.530]  Now's the time to take advantage.

[03:21:45.327 --> 03:21:49.872]  Specials include Brain Force Plus, 50% off with free shipping.
[03:21:49.872 --> 03:21:53.997]  The Real Red Pill Plus, also 50% off with free shipping.
[03:21:53.997 --> 03:21:57.881]  Silver Bullet is available at 50% off as is Alpha Power.
[03:21:57.881 --> 03:22:01.165]  DNA Force Plus, all the FloraLife products.
[03:22:01.980 --> 03:22:06.383]  And the InfoWars Life Select one-year, six-month, three-month food supply.
[03:22:06.383 --> 03:22:08.144]  Again, 50% off.
[03:22:08.144 --> 03:22:09.886]  That is absolutely huge.
[03:22:09.886 --> 03:22:13.388]  You can get a one-year food supply for half off.
[03:22:13.388 --> 03:22:14.409]  That is massive.
[03:22:14.409 --> 03:22:16.990]  Now is the time to stock up on that.
[03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:20.853]  Also, immune wall and pollen block, both 50% off.
[03:22:20.853 --> 03:22:23.295]  Again, everything with free shipping.
[03:22:23.295 --> 03:22:26.137]  It is the Memorial Day Blowout Special.
[03:22:26.137 --> 03:22:29.139]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:22:31.178 --> 03:22:32.319]  Now let's go to this video.
[03:22:32.319 --> 03:22:33.699]  This is the truth about Italy.
[03:22:33.699 --> 03:22:35.380]  This went up last night.
[03:22:35.380 --> 03:22:38.902]  Absolutely monumental developments in Europe.
[03:22:38.902 --> 03:22:42.263]  Barely anyone's talking about this because basically they don't want to.
[03:22:42.263 --> 03:22:48.927]  They're absolutely terrified of this populist wave sweeping the continent and where it could head next.
[03:22:48.927 --> 03:22:51.048]  Here is the truth about Italy.
[03:22:52.441 --> 03:22:56.305]  In case you missed it, a political earthquake just hit Europe.
[03:22:56.305 --> 03:22:59.608]  An event that has the global elite truly terrified.
[03:22:59.608 --> 03:23:06.055]  In the most momentous challenge to the status quo in generations, Italy formed a populist government.
[03:23:06.055 --> 03:23:07.436]  Why does that matter?
[03:23:07.436 --> 03:23:14.003]  Because Italy's ruling populist left-right coalition is both anti-mass migration and Eurosceptic.
[03:23:14.543 --> 03:23:24.410]  If Italy's grand experiment succeeds, it serves as a template for the rest of Europe and a harbinger of doom for the survival of the European Union.
[03:23:24.410 --> 03:23:35.237]  If you doubt that, then just look at how EU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger reacted to the election, saying, quote, the markets will teach Italians to vote for the right thing.
[03:23:35.237 --> 03:23:40.300]  In other words, technocrats will punish you for exercising your democratic choice.
[03:23:40.740 --> 03:23:45.644]  An astounding level of arrogance, but one that we've come to expect from the EU.
[03:23:45.644 --> 03:24:00.157]  But worse than this, the Globalists actually attempted to install a former IMF Director and Europhile as Prime Minister, completely overriding the will of the people who voted for the exact opposite.
[03:24:00.157 --> 03:24:04.340]  They've got the nerve to call Viktor Orban an autocrat.
[03:24:04.340 --> 03:24:07.343]  When he was democratically elected in a fair fight,
[03:24:07.563 --> 03:24:25.700]  While literally attempting to institute a bloodless coup to overturn the results of a national election, Juncker has the nerve to tell Italians to work harder and stop blaming the EU for its problems, when Italy's economic problems only began after they joined the Eurozone.
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:26.341]  Before that,
[03:24:26.661 --> 03:24:28.163]  They were a powerhouse.
[03:24:28.163 --> 03:24:41.255]  If you doubt how much Italy's populist coalition threatens the European elite, just look at how two of its preeminent propaganda organs, the Financial Times and Der Spiegel, referred to what happened.
[03:24:41.255 --> 03:24:51.905]  The FT called the democratically elected coalition barbarians, while Der Spiegel said, quote, Italy is destroying itself and dragging down Europe with it.
[03:24:52.045 --> 03:25:00.768]  Look at how George Soros reacted, spewing evidence-free conspiracy theories about Matteo Salvini being a puppet of Putin.
[03:25:00.768 --> 03:25:06.211]  Suffice to say, those globalist tears taste extra salty right now.
[03:25:06.211 --> 03:25:14.894]  While the new left-right coalition has numerous populist planks, the most important of which is undoubtedly its vehement opposition to mass immigration.
[03:25:15.214 --> 03:25:22.717]  League leader and Interior Minister Salvini has vowed to deport 500,000 illegal migrants.
[03:25:22.717 --> 03:25:31.560]  Salvini had a message for illegals during a rally on Sunday when he told them, quote, the free ride is over, it's time to pack your bags.
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:34.101]  The incentive for migrants to reach Italy via the
[03:25:34.161 --> 03:25:35.301]  ...and turn the boats back.
[03:25:54.446 --> 03:26:04.711]  Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, has also suggested that GDP will no longer be seen as the primary indicator of economic growth.
[03:26:04.711 --> 03:26:19.157]  This represents a wholesale rejection of neoliberalism and a return to a kind of localist, high Tory-style protectionist view that rampant capitalism and corporatism has massively eroded communities and culture.
[03:26:19.457 --> 03:26:35.392]  This idea that monopoly capitalism has in fact harmed social cohesion, diluted and vulgarized culture and corroded morality is one now taking root amongst increasing numbers of thinkers and influencers on the new right.
[03:26:35.732 --> 03:26:48.321]  Meanwhile, the League's Lorenzo Fontana, now Minister for Families, has even suggested that abortion and the promotion of gay marriage is part of a globalist plot to quote, erase our people.
[03:26:48.321 --> 03:26:56.247]  The new government plans to address Italy's plummeting birth rate by boosting welfare for mothers and providing free childcare facilities.
[03:26:56.667 --> 03:27:08.069]  By upholding the country's Catholic identity and proposing to register and monitor mosques, the Populist Coalition is also showing its intention to reassert Italy's Christian heritage.
[03:27:08.069 --> 03:27:24.493]  Putting itself at loggerheads with the Pope, who has embraced a wishy-washy internationalist view of Islam, completely at odds with the fact that Islamism is an invasive, aggressive doctrine that threatens the very survival of Europe as we know it.
[03:27:24.853 --> 03:27:41.884]  The coalition also wants to end sanctions on Russia and work with Moscow on combating the common threat of Islamic terrorism, a vital policy that Trump attempted to pursue in America before he was hamstrung by relentless hysterical outbursts over Russian collusion.
[03:27:41.884 --> 03:27:49.189]  Italy's populist coalition has embarked on a policy program that every other European country should be looking to mirror.
[03:27:49.409 --> 03:27:57.953]  The global elite will now attempt to portray everything that happens in the country as a manifestation of chaos and instability.
[03:27:57.953 --> 03:28:13.341]  In reality, the only chaos and instability is that which is currently consuming the dictatorial, arrogant, corrupt European Union as voters across the continent reject its arcane, discredited, Byzantine tyranny.
[03:28:13.341 --> 03:28:15.642]  Italy has said no to mass immigration.
[03:28:16.002 --> 03:28:17.324]  No to the EU.
[03:28:17.324 --> 03:28:20.868]  No to the erosion of its cultural birthright.
[03:28:20.868 --> 03:28:29.659]  And starting with Sweden in September, we can now truly begin to hope that the rest of Europe will follow the same course.
[03:28:32.683 --> 03:28:35.105]  That is the truth about Italy.
[03:28:35.105 --> 03:28:38.208]  Absolutely monumental development in Europe.
[03:28:38.208 --> 03:28:46.155]  And after the break, we're going to tell you how the Bilderberg globalists are reacting to this as they prepare to meet in, you guessed it, Italy.
[03:28:46.155 --> 03:28:48.617]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[03:28:48.617 --> 03:28:49.078]  We'll be back.

[03:29:34.961 --> 03:29:40.646]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:29:40.646 --> 03:29:44.088]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[03:31:06.625 --> 03:31:09.487]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[03:31:10.988 --> 03:31:11.108]  It's
[03:31:11.288 --> 03:31:11.548]  I think?

[03:32:57.164 --> 03:32:59.785]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.896 --> 03:33:12.096]  You found it.
[03:33:12.096 --> 03:33:14.157]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:14.157 --> 03:33:17.157]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.157 --> 03:33:22.859]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:22.859 --> 03:33:23.379]  We are back.
[03:33:23.379 --> 03:33:25.879]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.879 --> 03:33:30.060]  Now, this election in Italy should be one of the biggest stories on the planet.
[03:33:30.060 --> 03:33:35.681]  We're talking about the first populist government in Europe for generations.
[03:33:35.681 --> 03:33:37.061]  This is absolutely huge.
[03:33:37.061 --> 03:33:39.342]  And let's not forget what they tried to do last week.
[03:33:39.969 --> 03:33:52.638]  Imagine for a second if, you know, Donald Trump had won the election, which he did, and then the Electoral College said, oh by the way, we're not going to let Donald Trump take his position in the Oval Office, we're going to give it to Hillary Clinton instead.
[03:33:52.638 --> 03:33:55.920]  Sorry, your votes mean absolutely nothing.
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:33:58.722]  That's literally what they tried to do in Italy.
[03:33:58.722 --> 03:34:04.066]  They tried to install this technocrat, who was a former IMF official, a Europhile,
[03:34:04.736 --> 03:34:06.337]  Until they had another election.
[03:34:06.337 --> 03:34:12.540]  The two winning parties, who were still arguing over how to form a coalition, didn't want that to happen.
[03:34:12.540 --> 03:34:14.541]  The Italian people didn't want it to happen.
[03:34:14.541 --> 03:34:18.203]  But the technocratic government simply said, oh, we're going to do it anyway.
[03:34:18.203 --> 03:34:19.544]  Thankfully, it didn't work.
[03:34:19.544 --> 03:34:24.267]  I imagine they would have had riots on the streets if they'd have tried to pull it off.
[03:34:24.267 --> 03:34:26.568]  But now we have an agreement.
[03:34:26.568 --> 03:34:32.491]  We have a platform, a policy platform, which, as I said in that video, should be mirrored across the rest of the continent.
[03:34:33.152 --> 03:34:36.753]  And we have the globalists running scared.
[03:34:36.753 --> 03:34:38.374]  Drudge report linked to this earlier.
[03:34:38.374 --> 03:34:40.995]  It is up on Infowars.com.
[03:34:40.995 --> 03:34:44.116]  Bilderberg Globalists concerned about populist uprising in Europe.
[03:34:44.116 --> 03:34:45.277]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:34:45.277 --> 03:34:46.757]  Go and look at their agenda.
[03:34:46.757 --> 03:34:49.459]  It's number one on the list.
[03:34:49.459 --> 03:34:52.940]  The annual elitist confab is set to meet this week in Turin.
[03:34:53.618 --> 03:35:00.180]  Which is an appropriate venue given that Italy has just elected an anti-mass-migration, Eurosceptic coalition government.
[03:35:00.180 --> 03:35:13.825]  Let's not forget the promise made by Salvini is to deport, not only to stop migrants coming in, economic migrants who aren't real refugees, but to deport half a million illegal aliens already in Italy.
[03:35:13.825 --> 03:35:17.807]  That is an absolutely huge number, but he's promised to do it.
[03:35:17.807 --> 03:35:18.647]  Meanwhile, we have the EU.
[03:35:19.781 --> 03:35:27.328]  We have the globalists trying to punish all these different European countries by forcing them to take migrants when they don't want to.
[03:35:27.328 --> 03:35:28.669]  Italy has said no.
[03:35:28.669 --> 03:35:30.370]  Italy has rejected it.
[03:35:30.370 --> 03:35:33.353]  And now the Bilderberg globalists are not happy.
[03:35:33.353 --> 03:35:34.534]  What are they going to do about it?
[03:35:34.534 --> 03:35:36.075]  Well, what did they do about Brexit?
[03:35:36.075 --> 03:35:45.103]  Nothing, apart from try to derail it after it was already voted for, which is exactly what they're going to do, try and do again.
[03:35:45.103 --> 03:35:46.604]  Now, the list for the Bilderberg group
[03:35:47.156 --> 03:36:05.743]  Annual Confab has been released, it has several high-profile individuals on it, it has all the usual people that you would expect, but it's their agenda that's key, because again, this is always vague, it's always non-specific, but number one on the list, they're talking about the populist movement across Europe.
[03:36:05.743 --> 03:36:15.167]  So they're very concerned about what's happening in Italy, because again, it could be the example that could set the stage for the rest of the continent.
[03:36:15.715 --> 03:36:18.536]  So absolutely monumental developments.
[03:36:18.536 --> 03:36:19.677]  And nobody's talking about it.
[03:36:19.677 --> 03:36:22.058]  It should be one of the biggest stories on the planet now.
[03:36:22.058 --> 03:36:23.198]  Nobody's talking about it.
[03:36:23.198 --> 03:36:30.141]  Nobody was really even talking about it last week when they literally tried to have a bloodless coup and install a technocrat.
[03:36:30.141 --> 03:36:33.863]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:36:33.863 --> 03:36:38.185]  Now you've probably seen the news about Miss America.
[03:36:38.185 --> 03:36:42.587]  Contestants will no longer be judged on personal appearances.
[03:36:43.413 --> 03:36:44.033]  That's right.
[03:36:44.033 --> 03:36:53.718]  Gretchen Carlson, who is now apparently the head of Miss America, has basically said that it's more important what comes out of their mouths, that's what we should care about.
[03:36:53.718 --> 03:36:58.020]  I mean, after all, it's not like this is a beauty pageant, is it?
[03:36:58.020 --> 03:37:00.121]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[03:37:00.121 --> 03:37:01.642]  It's a beauty pageant.
[03:37:01.642 --> 03:37:07.025]  These women are supposed to be judged on their attractiveness, on their physical appearance, on their
[03:37:07.588 --> 03:37:08.628]  Beauty!
[03:37:08.628 --> 03:37:10.149]  That's the whole point.
[03:37:10.149 --> 03:37:16.332]  The depths of stupidity have not been plumbed until we saw this story today.
[03:37:16.332 --> 03:37:25.756]  I mean, we've had the stories about banning grid girls, the NFL discussing now banning cheerleaders, they're banning booze babes all across the Western world.
[03:37:25.756 --> 03:37:31.479]  Now Miss America contestants will no longer be judged on personal appearances.
[03:37:31.479 --> 03:37:34.200]  But, generally speaking, the kind of lame
[03:37:35.024 --> 03:37:38.568]  Over-forced, virtue-signalling clichés that they can come out with.
[03:37:38.568 --> 03:37:40.350]  That's what they're going to be judged on.
[03:37:40.350 --> 03:37:48.679]  Which, of course, will lead to women who aren't attractive, who are fat and ugly feminists, trying to take part in this and trying to win it.
[03:37:48.679 --> 03:37:52.243]  And some of them probably will win it if this is the new standard for beauty.
[03:37:54.352 --> 03:38:01.435]  Contestants will be asked to, quote, demonstrate their passion, intelligence, and overall understanding of the job of Miss America.
[03:38:01.435 --> 03:38:03.595]  Which, of course, is completely dull and boring.
[03:38:03.595 --> 03:38:04.856]  Nobody will watch that.
[03:38:04.856 --> 03:38:06.956]  They've banned the swimsuit contest.
[03:38:06.956 --> 03:38:09.637]  They've banned the evening gown contest.
[03:38:09.637 --> 03:38:14.999]  Nobody is gonna watch your stupid beauty pageant if it's not even a beauty pageant.
[03:38:14.999 --> 03:38:17.560]  You utter idiot!
[03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:19.381]  But again, we've seen this elsewhere, haven't we?
[03:38:19.381 --> 03:38:21.322]  We've seen it with the NFL.
[03:38:21.322 --> 03:38:22.542]  Kneeling in front of the anthem.
[03:38:22.984 --> 03:38:26.665]  We've seen it in the awards shows, the Golden Globes, the Oscars.
[03:38:26.665 --> 03:38:33.608]  Well, they've turned them into basically a mechanism to amplify cliched, woke social justice narratives.
[03:38:33.608 --> 03:38:35.269]  And how did Americans respond?
[03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:37.649]  How did they respond to the NFL controversy?
[03:38:37.649 --> 03:38:40.190]  They turned away in their droves.
[03:38:40.190 --> 03:38:43.252]  How did they respond to the Golden Globes, to the Oscars?
[03:38:43.252 --> 03:38:45.692]  Lowest ratings ever!
[03:38:45.692 --> 03:38:46.873]  This ain't gonna work!
[03:38:47.403 --> 03:38:55.881]  They're literally committing suicide so they can have some kind of lame virtue signaling moment that nobody even cares about.
[03:38:55.881 --> 03:38:56.662]  The changes...
[03:38:57.563 --> 03:39:18.819]  A part of an effort to bring the contest in line with the Me Too movement, which of course now we know has been completely exploited and exaggerated to basically denounce everyone as guilty until proven innocent, to the point where now 25% of US millennial men think that asking a girl out on a date is sexual harassment.
[03:39:19.219 --> 03:39:20.900]  Yeah, how's that gonna go?
[03:39:20.900 --> 03:39:21.680]  How's that gonna go?
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:30.064]  With marriage rates already declining, fertility rates declining, people not having kids anymore, how's that gonna work out for you?
[03:39:30.064 --> 03:39:42.170]  Carlson, who by the way was a very poor Fox News host, she's probably the worst one there, said we've heard from a lot of young women who say we'd love to be a part of your program, but we don't want to be out there in high heels and a swimsuit.
[03:39:42.170 --> 03:39:43.031]  That's the point!
[03:39:44.764 --> 03:39:45.584]  So guess what?
[03:39:45.584 --> 03:39:47.946]  You don't have to do that anymore.
[03:39:47.946 --> 03:39:48.526]  Oh, OK.
[03:39:48.526 --> 03:39:50.487]  So why don't we apply this to everything?
[03:39:50.487 --> 03:39:59.232]  Why don't we say, oh, by the way, those long jumpers, you know, the long jumpers in the Olympics, we're not going to judge it anymore on how long they can jump.
[03:39:59.232 --> 03:40:03.094]  No, we're going to judge it on the kind of speech they give beforehand.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:07.821]  We're going to judge... We're not going to judge Olympic swimmers on how well they swim.
[03:40:07.821 --> 03:40:12.862]  We're not going to judge the 100 metres race on who gets to 100 metres the quickest.
[03:40:12.862 --> 03:40:13.302]  No.
[03:40:13.302 --> 03:40:18.263]  We're going to judge it on who can recite feminist slam poetry the quickest.
[03:40:18.263 --> 03:40:24.764]  This is the race to the bottom in terms of quality and it's utterly, utterly stupid.
[03:40:24.764 --> 03:40:26.464]  But again, I've talked about it before.
[03:40:26.464 --> 03:40:30.605]  We had the grid girls, we had the booth babes, we had the cheerleaders going.
[03:40:30.605 --> 03:40:32.585]  Now this is going the same way.
[03:40:33.902 --> 03:40:40.267]  The whole point of Miss America is the enjoyment of objective standards of beauty and that's what this is all about.
[03:40:40.267 --> 03:41:00.002]  It's about fat ugly feminists, it's about far-left social justice warriors launching war on objective beauty standards because they literally think there's a giant patriarchal conspiracy which has been, you know, foisted on the world in coordination in a conspiracy with the beauty industry
[03:41:00.703 --> 03:41:25.345]  But these objective standards of beauty, you know, women who have an attractive face, have an attractive body, work out, are physically in shape, have certain hip-to-waist ratios, which again, scientifically proven to have objective standards of beauty, they literally think that's a giant conspiracy that people got behind closed doors and talked about for decades, and that that's why men are attracted to attractive women.
[03:41:25.345 --> 03:41:26.586]  They literally think that.
[03:41:26.866 --> 03:41:31.867]  And this is the kind of intersectional insanity that is now ruining everything.
[03:41:31.867 --> 03:41:36.768]  They won't be satisfied until they've ruined absolutely everything.
[03:41:36.768 --> 03:41:43.029]  They won't be satisfied until their puritanical jihad against fun is complete.
[03:41:43.029 --> 03:41:46.910]  Now, as I write in the article, you know, what's next?
[03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:47.690]  Miss America?
[03:41:47.690 --> 03:41:48.470]  Miss?
[03:41:48.470 --> 03:41:49.330]  Miss?
[03:41:49.330 --> 03:41:51.191]  Sounds pretty transphobic to me.
[03:41:51.191 --> 03:41:52.971]  Why don't we have hordes of fat, hairy men
[03:41:53.413 --> 03:41:58.476]  Why aren't they allowed to enter, given that attractiveness is no longer an advantage, okay?
[03:41:58.476 --> 03:42:02.279]  You're saying that attractiveness, personal appearance, no longer matters.
[03:42:02.279 --> 03:42:03.900]  Where are the fat, hairy men?
[03:42:03.900 --> 03:42:05.260]  I mean, maybe I can enter.
[03:42:05.260 --> 03:42:10.504]  And you know, given that that's not a standard for victory, attractiveness, anyone can win.
[03:42:10.504 --> 03:42:13.926]  Absolutely anyone can win.
[03:42:13.926 --> 03:42:18.388]  So again, the intersectional nonsense that they've tried to inject into everything.
[03:42:18.388 --> 03:42:19.169]  You see it across the board.
[03:42:20.154 --> 03:42:34.988]  You see it in sports, you see it in Hollywood, you see it in award shows, you even see it in art, where now a piece of art isn't judged on its objective beauty or the skill or craft that went into it, it's judged on whether or not it has the right social justice message.
[03:42:35.388 --> 03:42:48.286]  They're turning everything into an amplification device for their narrative, for their insane propaganda, which fundamentally is an attack on the family and an attack on basic, normal biology.
[03:42:48.286 --> 03:42:49.588]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:42:49.588 --> 03:42:51.190]  We'll be back after the break in 4Wars.com.
[03:42:53.177 --> 03:42:57.122]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.122 --> 03:43:00.407]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.407 --> 03:43:06.675]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.675 --> 03:43:09.459]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:14.002]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.002 --> 03:43:20.466]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.466 --> 03:43:25.429]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.189 --> 03:43:30.112]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.112 --> 03:43:37.318]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.318 --> 03:43:42.021]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.021 --> 03:43:48.226]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.226 --> 03:43:52.209]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.055 --> 03:43:57.039]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:43:57.039 --> 03:43:59.782]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:43:59.782 --> 03:44:04.586]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[03:44:04.586 --> 03:44:07.009]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:44:07.009 --> 03:44:10.032]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[03:44:13.695 --> 03:44:15.116]  Or wherever you go.

[03:45:53.619 --> 03:46:01.244]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:46:01.244 --> 03:46:09.169]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:46:09.169 --> 03:46:12.251]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:46:12.891 --> 03:46:17.535]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:46:17.535 --> 03:46:21.678]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:46:21.678 --> 03:46:24.821]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[03:46:24.821 --> 03:46:29.584]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:46:29.584 --> 03:46:32.587]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:46:33.027 --> 03:46:48.120]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:49.662]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:46:49.662 --> 03:46:57.088]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[03:46:57.088 --> 03:46:59.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.022 --> 03:47:13.826]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[03:47:13.826 --> 03:47:17.609]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.609 --> 03:47:23.554]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:23.554 --> 03:47:24.115]  We're back.
[03:47:24.115 --> 03:47:27.718]  It is the final segment of the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.718 --> 03:47:30.961]  Now, before the break, we were talking about the Miss America contest.
[03:47:30.961 --> 03:47:34.123]  Contestants have been no longer judged on personal appearance.
[03:47:34.123 --> 03:47:37.286]  Now, the studio reminded me of this video that we have, which we're going to roll now.
[03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:54.829]  Because it's very appropriate, given what Gretchen Carlson said, to justify this move, where not only are they banning the swimsuit contest and the evening gown contest, they're saying that the contestants will no longer be judged on their personal beauty in a beauty pageant.
[03:47:54.829 --> 03:47:57.852]  But they will be judged on, according to Gretchen Carlson,
[03:47:58.559 --> 03:48:00.840]  What comes out of their mouths?
[03:48:00.840 --> 03:48:05.302]  Because according to her, that's what we care about.
[03:48:05.302 --> 03:48:09.164]  Let's listen to what came out of the mouth of one beauty contestant.
[03:48:09.164 --> 03:48:13.746]  I think this was Miss Teen USA in this infamous clip.
[03:48:13.746 --> 03:48:17.128]  Let's roll it.
[03:48:17.128 --> 03:48:22.550]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a world map.
[03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:23.391]  Why do you think this is?
[03:48:25.879 --> 03:48:28.683]  I personally believe that U.S.
[03:48:28.683 --> 03:48:40.618]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have that, and I believe that our education, such as
[03:48:41.218 --> 03:48:45.580]  Okay, so we're being told that we should judge beauty pageant contestants
[03:49:11.181 --> 03:49:15.083]  Based not on their appearance, but on what comes out of their mouths.
[03:49:15.083 --> 03:49:18.405]  According to Gretchen Coulson, that's what we should care about.
[03:49:18.405 --> 03:49:23.328]  Well, that's what comes out of their mouths, and that's not the point, is it?
[03:49:23.328 --> 03:49:30.352]  Literally no one cares what comes out of their mouths unless they say something stupid, because we're not trying to find the next...
[03:49:30.914 --> 03:49:31.874]  Rocket scientists!
[03:49:31.874 --> 03:49:34.035]  We're not trying to find the next brain surgeon.
[03:49:34.035 --> 03:49:38.017]  We're trying to find Miss America, the most attractive woman.
[03:49:38.017 --> 03:49:47.001]  Of course, there are other categories, but the beauty, the attractiveness, the personal appearance has to be prime amongst them, given that it's a beauty pageant.
[03:49:47.001 --> 03:49:50.562]  And again, they say, oh, we need to provide good role models for young women.
[03:49:50.562 --> 03:49:52.743]  So provide those too!
[03:49:52.743 --> 03:49:59.146]  You can provide academic, you can provide intellectual role models for young women, as well as having beauty pageants.
[03:49:59.972 --> 03:50:04.733]  Those two things can exist in the same world, you utter morons!
[03:50:04.733 --> 03:50:09.394]  And again, there's some goal of this, there's some objective.
[03:50:09.394 --> 03:50:20.817]  The eventual consequence would be to take away opportunities from attractive young women, who maybe aren't the most intelligent, but are intelligent enough to use their looks to get ahead in life.
[03:50:20.817 --> 03:50:22.878]  Why would anyone deprive them of that?
[03:50:22.878 --> 03:50:26.839]  If you're an actual feminist, why are you trying to deprive women of opportunities?
[03:50:28.522 --> 03:50:41.190]  Again, they put out a tweet today, the official Miss America Twitter account, where they showed a bikini going up in smoke with the hashtag ByeByeBikini.
[03:50:41.190 --> 03:50:42.611]  Well, I don't know about ByeByeBikini.
[03:50:42.611 --> 03:50:45.353]  I think it's going to be ByeByeViewers for you.
[03:50:45.353 --> 03:50:52.437]  Because the American people have spoken when you've tried to insert this lame, floppy, virtue-signalling crap into everything else.
[03:50:52.437 --> 03:50:55.099]  They've rejected it time and time again.
[03:50:56.181 --> 03:51:14.896]  People are sick of social justice, of intersexual nonsense being injected into absolutely everything when they're trying to watch a football game, when they're trying to watch a beauty pageant, when they're trying to get away from politics for five frigging minutes, and they can't because you just keep shoving it down their throats.
[03:51:14.896 --> 03:51:19.399]  Bye bye bikini, no, bye bye viewers, bye bye Miss America.
[03:51:19.399 --> 03:51:20.400]  Absolutely.
[03:51:25.649 --> 03:51:31.312]  Moving on to what's happening in the UK, we have another poll out of the UK today, which kind of relates to this.
[03:51:31.312 --> 03:51:32.853]  This is a headline out of Westmonster.
[03:51:32.853 --> 03:51:37.075]  66% of Brits think political correctness has gone too far.
[03:51:38.371 --> 03:51:42.412]  Every day now in the mainstream media the talk is of being offended or something being banned.
[03:51:42.412 --> 03:51:52.615]  Back in the real world though, Brits have had enough of BS political correctness that all too often stifles debate, comedy and fun and beauty pageants.
[03:51:52.615 --> 03:52:02.357]  Number crunching politics polling firm CapEx has found that 66% of Brits think political correctness has gone too far.
[03:52:02.357 --> 03:52:05.358]  Only 9% saying it hasn't gone far enough.
[03:52:06.354 --> 03:52:13.342]  Now these figures include 41% who say that it has gone much too far, and an additional 25% saying it has gone a little too far.
[03:52:13.342 --> 03:52:22.332]  So you're talking about the clear majority of the British people who think that political correctness has gone too far, yet the point that this article makes, again, is it's that 9%
[03:52:23.996 --> 03:52:31.784]  That hardcore 9% that's permanently offended over absolutely everything, they're the ones who the companies apologize to.
[03:52:31.784 --> 03:52:40.713]  They're the ones who create the mass mob outrage online campaigns to shame, to silence people into basically cowardice, rolling over.
[03:52:40.993 --> 03:52:51.098]  Groveling, genuflecting to these idiots who don't have any real power, but just because there's a few of them and they're noisy about it, people cave, people back down.
[03:52:51.098 --> 03:52:56.721]  People need to stop caving and backing down to these idiots because they're nowhere near the majority.
[03:52:56.721 --> 03:53:02.684]  They're a tiny minority and they should be completely ignored.
[03:53:02.684 --> 03:53:06.065]  Now over in France, we have a fake news law being passed.
[03:53:06.065 --> 03:53:07.066]  This is out of AFP.
[03:53:08.160 --> 03:53:12.182]  France's fake news law leaves media experts uneasy.
[03:53:12.182 --> 03:53:19.806]  France is the latest country attempting to fight the scourge of fake news with legislation but opponents say the law won't work and could even be used to silence critics.
[03:53:19.806 --> 03:53:22.508]  Now they're calling it an attempt by the government.
[03:53:22.508 --> 03:53:25.249]  This is actually what the government said.
[03:53:25.249 --> 03:53:32.033]  They're talking about manipulation of information in the run-up to elections and they want to have the power to stop
[03:53:32.799 --> 03:53:34.921]  Manipulation of information.
[03:53:34.921 --> 03:53:51.936]  Now of course that is so vague that it could be used blanket style to silence dissent, to silence alternative information, to silence scandalous information potentially about political candidates, about establishment political candidates.
[03:53:51.936 --> 03:53:53.938]  So we see this across the board.
[03:53:53.938 --> 03:53:58.462]  Of course the EU threatening to fine people who don't remove fake news within 24 hours.
[03:53:59.927 --> 03:54:03.270]  Facebook has had a system where people can flag fake news.
[03:54:03.270 --> 03:54:04.711]  It completely backfired.
[03:54:04.711 --> 03:54:07.554]  It only made that news go more viral.
[03:54:07.554 --> 03:54:11.558]  Now, of course, there are fake news websites that put out genuinely fake news.
[03:54:11.558 --> 03:54:16.042]  But what they're trying to do with this is apply it in a vague slapdash fashion.
[03:54:16.042 --> 03:54:19.305]  So again, it silences conservative content.
[03:54:19.305 --> 03:54:20.506]  And it's in the algorithm.
[03:54:20.506 --> 03:54:21.667]  I've said it over and over again.
[03:54:21.667 --> 03:54:23.549]  We're all slaves to the algorithm.
[03:54:23.549 --> 03:54:26.191]  The studies show that they can shift millions
[03:54:26.997 --> 03:54:39.302]  Millions of votes prior to elections simply based on what search results come up first in terms of negativity and positivity towards a certain political candidate or a certain political party.
[03:54:39.302 --> 03:54:53.648]  I mean I can barely even find news articles that I've written that I'm trying to reference while writing a new news article on Google because they've buried them in the algorithm so much you can put in the exact headline into the search bar
[03:54:54.545 --> 03:54:58.248]  You can put my name, you can put InfoWars.com, and it still doesn't find it.
[03:54:58.248 --> 03:55:01.331]  Because they've buried InfoWars.com in the algorithm.
[03:55:01.331 --> 03:55:05.294]  They're doing the exact same thing on Facebook.
[03:55:05.294 --> 03:55:07.416]  This is the war of the algorithm.
[03:55:07.416 --> 03:55:19.507]  This is what will decide future elections, and this is why, to some extent, these monopolies, which are not free market, need to be regulated, and people need to have an Internet Bill of Rights.
[03:55:21.414 --> 03:55:29.260]  Now speaking about Europe again, this is out of Breitbart, Dunkirk, lorry driver stabbed by migrants trying to break into Britain.
[03:55:29.260 --> 03:55:37.246]  The lorry driver has been seriously injured by two migrants who were trying to break into his vehicle for a right of Britain at the rest stop near Dunkirk.
[03:55:37.246 --> 03:55:44.732]  This was a Lithuanian who was taking a break after several hours of driving at rest area in the town of Krewick in France when he heard noises in his truck.
[03:55:45.726 --> 03:55:49.710]  Basically they ambushed him, they stabbed him, trying to get a free ride.
[03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:59.058]  Again, last week we had a story about female truck drivers being threatened with rape if they don't let these migrants get on board and sneak into the country.
[03:56:00.060 --> 03:56:01.901]  They raised the Calais migrant camp.
[03:56:01.901 --> 03:56:03.641]  They just went to different areas of France.
[03:56:03.641 --> 03:56:04.781]  They're living on the streets.
[03:56:04.781 --> 03:56:06.962]  Paris is basically an open-air migrant camp.
[03:56:06.962 --> 03:56:09.783]  They're saying, oh, you can just take over these parks.
[03:56:09.783 --> 03:56:11.624]  It's absolute bedlam.
[03:56:11.624 --> 03:56:15.725]  The Calais migrant camp itself is slowly coming back into existence.
[03:56:15.725 --> 03:56:26.068]  Again, they haven't dealt with the problem, which is why we need governments like the one in Italy, which has vowed to deport 500,000 illegals and stop this insane program.
[03:56:26.838 --> 03:56:35.762]  Of basically being a victim of the EU's threats and intimidation to forcibly take migrants, to forcibly erase their own populations.
[03:56:35.762 --> 03:56:38.304]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:56:38.304 --> 03:56:45.207]  Meanwhile over in Sweden, municipal residents will pray for diversity on their own national day.
[03:56:45.207 --> 03:56:46.888]  This is the municipality of Falu.
[03:56:47.577 --> 03:56:52.361]  Which celebrates National Day, basically Sweden's July the 4th on Wednesday.
[03:56:52.361 --> 03:56:59.387]  But they've been told by the local municipality that instead they will be praying for diversity.
[03:56:59.387 --> 03:57:05.932]  Now let's not forget that Sweden is a country who they appointed as the head of their National Heritage Board.
[03:57:05.932 --> 03:57:12.198]  Somebody who admitted, who was a Muslim migrant, who admitted that he knew nothing about Swedish heritage.
[03:57:12.198 --> 03:57:15.881]  And what little he did know about Swedish heritage was racist.
[03:57:17.239 --> 03:57:20.741]  Now, of course, Sweden is in the same boat as Italy to some extent.
[03:57:20.741 --> 03:57:23.122]  They've got a big election coming up in September.
[03:57:23.122 --> 03:57:29.104]  The Nationalists, the anti-mass migration party are doing really well and we hope they have massive success.
[03:57:29.104 --> 03:57:33.886]  We hope they mirror the example, the fantastic example set by Italy.
[03:57:33.886 --> 03:57:35.627]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:57:35.627 --> 03:57:37.648]  War Room is coming up next.
[03:57:37.648 --> 03:57:38.488]  InfoWars.com.
