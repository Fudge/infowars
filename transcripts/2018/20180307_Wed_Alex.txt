[00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:10.636]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:16.384]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:19.568]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.137]  Absolutely huge breaking news today.
[00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:27.779]  Stacks of news today.
[00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.383]  You've got Seattle going full libtard.
[00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:38.067]  A judge saying that your car is now your home so it can't be impounded so just park it anywhere.
[00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:43.292]  They're confiscating guns in Seattle now if somebody calls the cops and says you look weird.
[00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:45.013]  You've got a teenager
[00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:50.702]  In Utah, who tried to detonate a bomb at Pineview School.
[00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:55.189]  And you've got Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a pulse all of a sudden.
[00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.572]  Somebody shocked him back to life.
[00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.077]  And he's calling out sanctuary cities as they are now being sued.
[00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.431]  With interference over immigration enforcement.
[00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.513]  Now, Alex, you've got all of these stacks of news going on.
[00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:14.997]  Meanwhile, the fake news, CNN, continues to desperately try to attack President Trump with lies.
[00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:19.620]  They bring some drunk on air to try to use him as a story maker.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.183]  I mean, the desperation right now from the fake news and the deep state is really starting to show itself.
[00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:37.886]  Well I gotta tell you, overall we're winning trying to bring prosperity and basic justice back, but throwing out the globalists and their minions really has made me sick and let me know that they're worse than I even thought they were.
[00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:46.229]  And the disease that was in the head of the fish has now reached all the way down to the tail, and we are just up against incredible times.
[00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.531]  You know, if the Democrats think that these
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.962]  Moderate trade sanctions are going to destroy Trump.
[00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:59.684]  Well, then they would be all for it, and they wouldn't be breathlessly fighting it as hard as they could.
[00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.946]  But they know that Europe has unfair internal tariffs against us, regulatory tariffs.
[00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.628]  They know that China has them.
[00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.069]  They know that Japan has gotten better.
[00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.489]  They've made a lot of good deals with the U.S.
[00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:15.471]  They've moved a lot of big factories here, because they understand that they need a market to trade with.
[00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:16.692]  The Japanese get it.
[00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:18.833]  China's being very, very adversarial.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.240]  So is Mexico.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.302]  These are all one-sided deals designed to geld, designed to castrate the United States.
[00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.363]  So you've got Cohn leaving.
[00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:31.483]  Well, look, we got the tax cuts.
[00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:32.004]  That's done.
[00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:32.564]  He's gone.
[00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:34.844]  But they are trying to destabilize the White House.
[00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:39.186]  I think the White House, for the first time in 14, 15 months, is in crisis.
[00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:47.248]  And we'll talk about some of that coming up with Stormy Daniels and all the things going on with that and with all the different moles that are inside there.
[00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:49.769]  But it is just a crazy time.
[00:02:50.529 --> 00:03:02.280]  To be alive and to see CNN and to see all these Democratic Party groups and all these organizations coming after free speech, trying to shut us down.
[00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:04.682]  It shows you what authoritarians they are.
[00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:09.687]  And it's very, very sad that this is the awful truth that we face.
[00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:10.428]  And when they fail,
[00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.484]  To remove our channel after four false strikes.
[00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:17.045]  There's still one on there that's frozen us being able to do live streams from that account.
[00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.527]  They then say it's all a hoax in the Washington Post.
[00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:27.410]  And they say, Jones shot videos from his home to make it look like he couldn't work from a studio, but it's all fake.
[00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.111]  No one's trying to shut him down.
[00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:38.074]  With the lawsuits and CNN saying, take down our channels, and Pepe the Frog lawsuit, and the Real News situation, and on and on and on.
[00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:39.515]  The Communist Party suing us.
[00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:49.306]  You cannot make this up, so the listeners know that we're good, we're honest, we're decent, we're trying to build a better future just like they are, and that's why we're all under attack.
[00:03:49.326 --> 00:03:58.567]  But realize, we're under attack because we echo the sentiment of the American people, who are basic good Christians, are free market folks, and that's why we're under attack.
[00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:06.029]  So I'm very, very honored with you, I want the rest of the crew to be in this position, but this is a very, very serious situation, and they are so angry the economy's coming back.
[00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.529]  We have a record Democrat turnout.
[00:04:09.472 --> 00:04:09.733]  I think so.
[00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.773]  And we know they brought in Democrats from all over to vote off voter registration rolls.
[00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:36.937]  So if your grandmother or grandfather or father or mother or brother or sister recently died, you've got to go through the procedure to get them off the voting rolls.
[00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.078]  You've got to talk to the county.
[00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:42.900]  You've got to go make sure that no one votes in their name this year to seal their names on the roll.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.242]  I'm not saying Republicans should go vote in the name of their dead family member.
[00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.264]  I'm just saying the Democrats are having people vote on average.
[00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.205]  Project Veritas caught this 10 times.
[00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:58.007]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:00.048]  Now, more than ever, is the time to
[00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:14.034]  Get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:19.399]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.
[00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.162]  We're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.

[00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.891]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:40.276]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:44.779]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:50.262]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.304]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:54.765]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:05:55.206 --> 00:06:02.671]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:07.212 --> 00:06:15.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are literally in the fight for our lives right now.
[00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:38.248]  And when we overturned the tables and elected President Trump, who's not a member of the secret society, who's not out to get you, who's not out to destroy America...
[00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:56.770]  We forced the Democrats and the Deep State and the globalists to go full bore and show their true colors as anti-American, open border, anti-white, anti-family, anti-Christian, liars, racists at the end of the day.
[00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.896]  And so here we are with all of these stacks of news to try to alert the American people about what's going on.
[00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:11.518]  But Alex, the desperation is really starting to show right now in the eyes of the globalists, in the eyes of the deep state.
[00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:13.359]  They're sending their minions out in the street.
[00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.121]  They're sending their minions out to vote.
[00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:24.609]  We are really in the fight for our lives right now, Alex, and I know you're on vacation, but you cannot take a break because this is truly just the most incredible time to be alive.
[00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:26.302]  Well, that's right.
[00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:31.966]  A lot of listeners have asked, Alex, if they're trying to shut down your channels, they're trying to kick you off the radio, and we see them all over the news.
[00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.947]  She's basically saying, arrest you, kill you, whatever.
[00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.788]  Why'd you take off a weekend?
[00:07:36.148 --> 00:07:37.149]  I hardly ever take off.
[00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:39.170]  I promised my middle daughter especially.
[00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.491]  I've never really seen real snow.
[00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:46.074]  You know, we've seen a little bit of ice on the ground here and there that I've taken her to Colorado so she could see snow.
[00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:47.075]  And boy, is she getting to see it.
[00:07:47.095 --> 00:07:49.616]  They've had record snow here in many areas this year.
[00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:51.678]  It's like five feet on the ground where we're at.
[00:07:53.372 --> 00:08:09.523]  I'm here fighting for my family, for my children, just like everybody else, and I cannot understate, I cannot overstate just how insane these people are, and how bullying they are, and how authoritarian they are, and how deceptive they are.
[00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:10.624]  They are not leftists.
[00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:19.330]  They are gangsters, and when I look at the history of the United States and the world, if you'd have told me 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, that
[00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:44.274]  InfoWars would be one of the biggest radio shows in the world, one of the biggest news sites in the world, and that CNN would be lobbying to have you taken off the air, that CNN would be trying to get a shutdown, trying to block books from being published, would be going and contacting sponsors, individually harassing them in gangster techniques, just as Breitbart got it right and said, CNN goes full gangster.
[00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:46.535]  If you'd have told me that
[00:08:47.398 --> 00:09:09.209]  If we sold somebody's painting that painted images of the campaign 2016, and there was a frog filling up maybe 5% of the total poster, that I'd be sued, and the Democratic Party would be funding it, or any of this, or just wild, fake EEOC complaints, all of it in one week, and it's a total, complete message to not us.
[00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:10.189]  They know we're not giving up.
[00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.790]  It's a message to all of you.
[00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.031]  They think you're cowards.
[00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:14.269]  We're good to go.
[00:09:35.857 --> 00:09:38.959]  And Jimmy Kimmel said that mainstream media's ratings are plunging because of Netflix.
[00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:40.740]  Netflix is mainly mainstream media.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.361]  Hollywood's imploding.
[00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:43.902]  The NFL's imploding.
[00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:47.924]  They went down 15 points with the take anything this year and last year.
[00:09:48.224 --> 00:09:51.606]  That's what's killing them is people are sick of the crud.
[00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.527]  It's the same numbers all over the world.
[00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:59.691]  Every populist candidate has basically won the last three years globally against the
[00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.137]  Centralized tyrants.
[00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:10.321]  And they even blamed Italy that elected 50 plus percent populist candidates in a parliamentary situation.
[00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:13.063]  That is a mega landslide.
[00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:21.768]  The Democratic Party was taken from dominant to one of the weakest parties out of eight major parties, more than 20 parties total, but eight major power parties.
[00:10:23.044 --> 00:10:27.046]  They were taken to the lowest rung with basically no power.
[00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:32.028]  Our media and Barack Obama came out and said, that's Russian influence.
[00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:38.492]  And Obama's surrogates, Samantha Powers, the rest of them came out and said, it is Russians.
[00:10:38.852 --> 00:10:40.553]  So the Russians are winning in Austria.
[00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:42.154]  The Russians are winning in Italy.
[00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.435]  The Russians are winning in Catalan.
[00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:45.575]  They're winning in Reykjavik.
[00:10:45.595 --> 00:10:46.516]  They're winning in Brazil.
[00:10:46.836 --> 00:10:46.936]  No.
[00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:52.443]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's not the Russians winning in the Czech Republic and Hungary and Romania.
[00:10:52.984 --> 00:11:02.549]  It's 10 million military-age men that have poured in the last six years, running around screaming Allah Akbar, raping, killing, bombing.
[00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:06.571]  And if the citizens say anything or the police say anything, they're arrested.
[00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:12.454]  So people understand this is a globalist takedown of the West and a pincer attack with the left on one side,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:29.705]  And Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, and Carlos Slim right behind him, and all the kingpins openly pushing the implosion of our borders, culture warfare, they're all tax-exempt, and then bringing in giant third-world populations to drive down wages and complete our journey into abject slavery.
[00:11:29.725 --> 00:11:41.048]  So we're going to talk about all of this here today, and I'm going to go over some of the big news, the good news, the bad news, the ugly news, but I would say Trump is in crisis because Americans are into gratification.
[00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.606]  After 14, 15 months, all the good things that have happened.
[00:11:44.626 --> 00:11:47.690]  Numbers show a lot of conservatives, libertarians are going back to sleep.
[00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.436]  Right as the Democrat globalist counter offensive is coming into full swing.
[00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:58.443]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, that said, before we go to all this news I just mentioned, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.306]  We are extending
[00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:03.467]  Because support is critical right now.
[00:12:03.487 --> 00:12:05.829]  I've got to countersue at least five of these groups.
[00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:07.710]  I've got a lot of lawyers that are top lawyers.
[00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.571]  I'm going to do it pro bono.
[00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:10.212]  I've got to pay for plane tickets.
[00:12:10.653 --> 00:12:12.314]  I've got to pay for people to take the transcripts.
[00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:14.456]  I've got to pay for the PIs.
[00:12:15.357 --> 00:12:18.059]  I've got to pay for all of it to very aggressively
[00:12:19.466 --> 00:12:21.288]  Go after some of these groups of people.
[00:12:21.328 --> 00:12:26.194]  By the way, we have open and shut cases, but it'll take a year to even begin to win these.
[00:12:26.654 --> 00:12:31.560]  But this is to let folks know, you file a frivolous lawsuit on me, I'm counter-suing you.
[00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:33.139]  And I'm coming after you.
[00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.739]  Everybody's been wanting me to sue for years.
[00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:36.240]  You have my word, listeners.
[00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:37.341]  My word.
[00:12:37.861 --> 00:12:40.043]  We've just been letting these build up to get the very best warrants.
[00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:44.065]  We have them now with slapback provisions, everything.
[00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:44.565]  We have them.
[00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.147]  Which my lawyers say shows how crazy the Democrats are.
[00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:51.430]  Because they admit the party's funding this, and they don't even care if they lose.
[00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.591]  This is how maniac-crazy these folks are.
[00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:55.292]  It doesn't matter, though.
[00:12:56.364 --> 00:13:04.156]  I'm going to personally get these things thrown out, and then I'm going to sue these individuals, the puppets, because that's who we've got to send a message to right afterwards.
[00:13:04.737 --> 00:13:07.121]  So it's on, ladies and gentlemen, but we need the funding.
[00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:10.346]  Flood us with the donations, buy the products, you name it.
[00:13:10.366 --> 00:13:10.907]  We make it easy.
[00:13:12.182 --> 00:13:14.003]  We have the very best products, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.684]  And we've got 30 to 80% off.
[00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:17.406]  We've never done an 80% off sale before.
[00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:19.327]  The average product is 50% off.
[00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:20.608]  Very close to loss leaders.
[00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.149]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:35.338]  Whether it's Rainforest, the amazing Nootropic, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, whether it is the new Alpha Power that is amazing, Super Blue Toothpaste, a limited supply came in.
[00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:37.159]  A bigger supply is coming in in about a month and a half.
[00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:38.440]  Our Floyd Free Toothpaste.
[00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.773]  That is all free shipping, store-wide, and 30 to 80% off.
[00:13:42.913 --> 00:13:47.057]  Now, you have to understand, at 80% off, those are complete and total lost leaders.
[00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:49.058]  But we put out hundreds and hundreds of t-shirts.
[00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:49.799]  Most of them sell out.
[00:13:49.819 --> 00:13:56.345]  We've had a lot that look really great, but that folks just didn't notice or didn't see or didn't find, because the shopping cart is so big.
[00:13:56.365 --> 00:14:03.251]  The online store is so big now, and infowarrestore.com, that a lot of these are really some of my favorite shirts that are below cost.
[00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:04.272]  When a t-shirt's 80% off,
[00:14:06.288 --> 00:14:09.451]  I mean, we're talking, I'm losing two or three bucks on those.
[00:14:09.692 --> 00:14:11.533]  So a great way to spread the word, free speech.
[00:14:12.054 --> 00:14:15.817]  Every little bit you do stands against these people, but we have the best deals ever.
[00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:18.620]  We have a support button at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:21.182]  Click on that, you can make donations.
[00:14:21.202 --> 00:14:23.164]  I want to thank all of you that have made donations.
[00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:26.307]  I want to thank you all for standing up for your own family, not just me.
[00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:33.347]  But I have been mobbed at the airport flying out here, and at the airport in Denver, and then now at the little lodge we're staying at.
[00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:34.008]  Mobbed.
[00:14:34.508 --> 00:14:38.492]  But almost everybody we talk to listens a couple times a month or a couple times a week.
[00:14:38.832 --> 00:14:40.394]  They weren't even aware of the censorship.
[00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:42.756]  And once they heard it, they were shocked and amazed.
[00:14:43.157 --> 00:14:45.579]  So that's the issue, is most of our listeners are already awake.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.041]  They already know what's going in.
[00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:51.065]  They tune in sometimes, but they just think we're a rock.
[00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.751]  It's always going to be there.
[00:14:53.672 --> 00:14:55.815]  All of our freedoms are being eroded by these tyrants.
[00:14:55.895 --> 00:15:00.099]  And now is the time to get really aggressive, and really upset, and really angry, and focused.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.062]  And we can completely turn the tide.
[00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.344]  But they're trying to break Trump.
[00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.226]  They're trying to break Infowars.
[00:15:06.246 --> 00:15:07.428]  They're trying to destroy Drudge.
[00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:08.892]  We're good to go.
[00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:37.973]  Of what they're doing, so when we come back I'm going to cover some news, but it's now time to get aggressive or we'll lose everything.
[00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:42.576]  Every other nation has fallen to this communism, this socialism, this race-based politics.
[00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:49.761]  The President and Vice President and Defense Minister of South Africa are now announcing they're going to take all land from whites and slaughter them.
[00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:51.922]  Just last week they said we may slaughter them.
[00:15:52.342 --> 00:15:54.264]  This week they said we will kill all the whites.
[00:15:54.844 --> 00:15:57.586]  It's happening all over Africa right now and again.
[00:15:58.206 --> 00:15:59.487]  We'll be right back and break all this down.
[00:16:02.802 --> 00:16:05.122]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:06.883]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:10.163]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:22.285]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:16:22.725 --> 00:16:31.787]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:16:32.327 --> 00:16:37.895]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:43.283]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:16:43.563 --> 00:16:45.526]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:47.849]  Bought these, sold out in a month.
[00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:51.904]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:16:52.124 --> 00:16:53.505]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.706]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:16:57.446 --> 00:16:59.407]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:02.228]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:03.844]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:13.470]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:22.376]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:22.596 --> 00:17:31.342]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:33.463 --> 00:17:52.553]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:53.054 --> 00:17:54.334]  It is amazing!
[00:17:55.735 --> 00:18:00.718]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.470]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.850]  Go ahead.
[00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.653]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:18:07.693 --> 00:18:18.022]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:18:18.203 --> 00:18:21.566]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:24.428]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:26.791]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:27.291]  Thank you.
[00:18:27.952 --> 00:18:30.434]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:34.218]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:37.741]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:38.782]  They are quality.
[00:18:39.123 --> 00:18:40.364]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:18:40.845 --> 00:18:43.567]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:44.268]  Absolutely.
[00:18:44.788 --> 00:18:57.695]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:19:02.495 --> 00:19:05.276]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:09.477]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:19:09.877 --> 00:19:12.817]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:15.198]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:19:15.758 --> 00:19:20.179]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:19:20.499 --> 00:19:22.559]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:29.221]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:37.068]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:42.713]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:19:43.113 --> 00:19:50.079]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.201]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:58.482]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:19:58.662 --> 00:20:00.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:27.088 --> 00:20:35.895]  Well, it's a good thing that InfoWars is now live 10 hours a day, because there's so much news, it's impossible to do it in just four hours.
[00:20:36.934 --> 00:20:38.474]  Owens Troyer here filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:39.935]  We've got Alex on the line with us.
[00:20:40.035 --> 00:20:42.215]  I mean, just to go over some of the stuff that you've got.
[00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:48.756]  You've got a Utah teenager attempts to detonate an explosive at a high school.
[00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:59.699]  You've got Seattle going left of mile confiscating guns, saying you cannot impound a car that's parked illegally if it's considered a person's home.
[00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:02.379]  I mean, can you imagine the precedent that sets?
[00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:05.100]  You've got Jeff Sessions calling out California.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.183]  And now the DOJ is going to sue California over interference with immigration enforcement.
[00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:12.144]  You've got sperm counts down.
[00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:15.585]  You've got Facebook about to release new robots.
[00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:17.146]  Meanwhile, rage against the machines.
[00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:19.227]  Humans are attacking driverless cars in California.
[00:21:19.267 --> 00:21:20.528]  I mean, it's all madness.
[00:21:20.568 --> 00:21:21.349]  It's all chaotic.
[00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:26.671]  Meanwhile, we're trying to restore the republic, and the left is trying to stop that from happening.
[00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.893]  Alex, you've been dealing with this
[00:21:29.633 --> 00:21:30.334]  Well they have a lot more left.
[00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:32.996]  I mean they say all over the web and all over the place they want to kill us.
[00:21:54.218 --> 00:21:54.998]  They want to kill Trump.
[00:21:55.018 --> 00:21:56.119]  They want to kill his family.
[00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:57.239]  They want to kill Barron.
[00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:58.259]  Trump is our champion.
[00:21:58.299 --> 00:21:59.880]  He went through living hell to get in there.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.001]  He has basically delivered on 60 plus percent of what he said he would do in 14 months.
[00:22:05.421 --> 00:22:08.422]  So it's not about a worship fest for Trump.
[00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:13.344]  It's about thanking God and thanking our lucky stars for how far we've come.
[00:22:13.424 --> 00:22:15.465]  Imagine if Hillary Clinton was in there right now.
[00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:16.825]  It's about waking up
[00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:18.611]  And staying awake.
[00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:21.112]  And I know our audience is the most awake, most focused.
[00:22:21.352 --> 00:22:22.633]  That's why they are hated.
[00:22:23.073 --> 00:22:26.014]  They are who CNN and George Soros and the globalists hate.
[00:22:26.074 --> 00:22:27.254]  And I'm not just patting them on the back.
[00:22:27.274 --> 00:22:30.916]  That's why when they call in and thank me, it's unbelievably ridiculous.
[00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:32.536]  We're all in this together.
[00:22:32.576 --> 00:22:33.877]  You're right beside me.
[00:22:33.897 --> 00:22:34.497]  You're behind me.
[00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:35.257]  You're in front of me.
[00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:37.938]  And they're here and they're doing it.
[00:22:38.018 --> 00:22:40.699]  And you know, if you go see a movie like V for Vendetta,
[00:22:42.001 --> 00:22:42.462]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:01.315]  Things are accelerating.
[00:23:01.395 --> 00:23:03.076]  Every major defense ministry agrees.
[00:23:03.816 --> 00:23:05.137]  You've got screen sickness.
[00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:06.958]  You've got the sperm counts continuing to plunge.
[00:23:07.598 --> 00:23:10.780]  You've got all the computers able to put out fake audio and fake video.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.641]  Or they can mimic anybody they want.
[00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.701]  To go next level fake news.
[00:23:15.721 --> 00:23:17.162]  You've got genetic engineering.
[00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:18.884]  You've got massive mutations.
[00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:22.066]  Thousands of percentage higher than they were just 20 years ago.
[00:23:22.386 --> 00:23:24.828]  You've got radiation levels increasing all over the planet.
[00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:27.170]  You've got every major reactor leaking.
[00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.013]  CNN says 50 plus percent.
[00:23:30.233 --> 00:23:35.117]  The world, the UN Atomic Energy Agency says 93 percent.
[00:23:35.737 --> 00:23:40.181]  The point is, it is insane because people don't care anymore.
[00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:56.140]  They've had it so good that a paradox begins where they've got it so good because people cared before them and were focused and hard-working and organized and then the civilization built by the previous people begins to crumble.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.461]  Then it goes into barbarism.
[00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:58.622]  Then it goes into oppression.
[00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:00.583]  Then it goes into conquest.
[00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:04.545]  And we're now entering that where I don't care if a kid's black, white, Hispanic, who they are.
[00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:07.067]  If they're raised in the West,
[00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:19.534]  If they're raised in these decadent cultures, they become hateful little spoiled rotten snobs, who on average, 50 plus percent of millennials want communism, want socialism.
[00:24:20.634 --> 00:24:26.557]  And when you say, well, go to Venezuela, go to North Korea, they go, F you, we're going to kill you, right winger.
[00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:28.678]  They don't even know that we're classical liberals.
[00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:29.579]  We're libertarians.
[00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:30.679]  We're the real liberals.
[00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:31.960]  All the terms are scrambled.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.901]  None of it even means anything anymore.
[00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:47.997]  Trump is just a pragmatist that wants things good for business and wants a happy country without a bunch of dysfunction because he's super OCD when it comes to everything being running right and being nice and being focused.
[00:24:48.017 --> 00:24:48.938]  And that's a good thing.
[00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:50.359]  So that's why they're trying to destroy him.
[00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:50.519]  Listen.
[00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:55.376]  In the, how many years has it been since they founded North Korea?
[00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:58.840]  1949, 1950, the Communist Chinese from the North helped back them invading.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.821]  The U.S.
[00:24:59.881 --> 00:25:01.703]  with MacArthur stops it.
[00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:03.385]  Here we are, ceasefire.
[00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:07.289]  They've only had four meetings since then with a delegation
[00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.171]  From the South to the North.
[00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:13.015]  Never in Kim Jong Un's reign for the last, what, five, six years.
[00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:18.540]  Now Trump has brought him to the table, where he met with the head of intelligence from South Korea and others.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.681]  Unprecedented.
[00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:22.924]  None of our media said Trump forced him to the table.
[00:25:22.984 --> 00:25:24.585]  Our military forced him to the table.
[00:25:24.806 --> 00:25:30.591]  Well, just a few months ago, they were shooting, you know, ICBMs all over the place, threatening to preemptively attack us.
[00:25:31.832 --> 00:25:32.473]  So you've got that.
[00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:35.796]  The only folks being honest about Trump and his trade deals is Barclays.
[00:25:35.836 --> 00:25:41.482]  They've got top analysts saying, no, these are one-sided deals with China, one-sided deals with the EU.
[00:25:41.922 --> 00:25:47.167]  Yes, China's only 6-7% of the steel production, but they're ramping up to be 20-30% in a year.
[00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:49.209]  It will kill what's left of us.
[00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.453]  So when Trump meets with the aluminum and steel manufacturers,
[00:25:52.973 --> 00:26:00.116]  When we are a shadow of what we were in the 50s or 60s, it is about survival for strategic national security.
[00:26:00.596 --> 00:26:09.119]  And the military's told Trump this, that we keep some of those damn steel production facilities, excuse me, it just makes me so angry, and some aluminum.
[00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:14.221]  We're about to have nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:15.342]  I'll say it again, nothing.
[00:26:16.102 --> 00:26:16.482]  Nothing.
[00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:20.764]  China is ramping up to totally deindustrialize us, and Trump is just
[00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:23.880]  He's almost like a speed bump to the New World Order.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.162]  He's almost just kind of like a softer landing for us going into slavery.
[00:26:27.562 --> 00:26:29.383]  All the big corporations are already moving to China.
[00:26:29.523 --> 00:26:30.823]  They've gone 0% tax.
[00:26:31.163 --> 00:26:33.425]  Apple is merging with them to surveil the American people.
[00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.686]  Mainstream news, no one even cares!
[00:26:36.186 --> 00:26:37.146]  This is red level!
[00:26:38.287 --> 00:26:40.488]  China, if you don't work, kills you.
[00:26:40.708 --> 00:26:42.048]  These average leftists love it.
[00:26:42.068 --> 00:26:47.311]  They fop around lazily going, screw you Alex Jones, screw you Trump, screw you America.
[00:26:48.368 --> 00:26:49.429]  But they love our honey.
[00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:52.171]  They love our milk and honey, to quote Merle Haggard.
[00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:55.714]  Maybe we should come in with, walk on the fighting side of me next segment.
[00:26:55.734 --> 00:26:57.415]  But that's what this comes down to.
[00:26:57.515 --> 00:27:02.739]  And then, we should probably show some of this video from the CBS News report out of New York when we come back.
[00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:03.740]  I'll do a few more minutes with you.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:12.367]  Fake TV, where they show Barack Obama's face in an example, which is computer programs anybody can buy now, saying things he never said.
[00:27:13.363 --> 00:27:17.626]  It would take Hollywood months to engineer that 20 years ago, or 30 years ago, for Forrest Gump.
[00:27:17.986 --> 00:27:20.648]  They can create fake video and fake audio.
[00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:24.930]  You can create fake video in hours that's undistinguishable from reality.
[00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.392]  You can create fake audio in minutes.
[00:27:28.132 --> 00:27:32.295]  You can buy it, the software, for $5,000.
[00:27:32.995 --> 00:27:40.300]  So that's what I'm saying is, if mainstream media has already shown they're fake news kings and will lie about all this stuff, we're only weeks away, I think, from them
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.500]  We're good to go.
[00:28:06.155 --> 00:28:09.377]  Well, and the thing is, their minions, their street minions, will buy anything.
[00:28:09.697 --> 00:28:14.080]  I mean, they believe this Russian collusion, they think Trump is Hitler, so they will believe anything.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:25.707]  And you've already seen radical leftists go out in the streets, professors attacking people with bike locks, you had the man go down to the baseball practice, the GOP baseball practice, and shoot that up.
[00:28:26.107 --> 00:28:30.050]  So you've got radical leftists getting more violent, getting more hate-filled,
[00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.052]  That will believe anything!
[00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:34.673]  They all look like they're brain dead.
[00:28:34.693 --> 00:28:36.294]  They look like reanimated corpses.
[00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:39.056]  They're all completely bombed out of their brains on drugs.
[00:28:39.557 --> 00:28:40.637]  They're partying all the time.
[00:28:40.658 --> 00:28:41.798]  They don't know what planet they're on.
[00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:43.840]  And then they see you and it's like a video game.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.901]  They think they're allowed to come over and get in your face.
[00:28:46.382 --> 00:28:49.124]  And as soon as you get back in their face, they get upset and say, how dare you?
[00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:51.205]  They're totally living in fantasy lands.
[00:28:51.445 --> 00:28:54.047]  And they're dangerous, dangerous, dangerous people.
[00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:56.129]  And thank God, this is America.
[00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:58.831]  The only other country like Switzerland where our forebears
[00:29:00.191 --> 00:29:01.172]  Brought us out of tyranny.
[00:29:01.192 --> 00:29:02.512]  We were born out of fighting.
[00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:12.536]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified Libtards on Twitter.
[00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:15.297]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[00:29:15.357 --> 00:29:21.339]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brainforce, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[00:29:21.379 --> 00:29:23.080]  Always use the opportunity to promote it.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.061]  We're good to go.
[00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:45.073]  Which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[00:29:45.173 --> 00:29:48.415]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[00:29:48.535 --> 00:29:56.219]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:57.299]  Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.421]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[00:29:59.461 --> 00:30:00.481]  It was hilarious.
[00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:04.804]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[00:30:04.924 --> 00:30:14.732]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[00:30:14.772 --> 00:30:17.174]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:24.219]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.441]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[00:30:27.603 --> 00:30:33.910]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brain Force.
[00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.093]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:37.614]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[00:30:37.675 --> 00:30:37.935]  Good.
[00:30:38.195 --> 00:30:39.517]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[00:30:39.677 --> 00:30:44.382]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[00:30:44.682 --> 00:30:46.765]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[00:30:47.205 --> 00:30:49.547]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[00:30:49.887 --> 00:30:52.788]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.289]  Get your Brain Force right now.
[00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:55.330]  Brain Force Plus.
[00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.252]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:08.804]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:31:09.185 --> 00:31:11.787]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:31:12.407 --> 00:31:15.850]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:31:16.111 --> 00:31:20.374]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:31:20.815 --> 00:31:24.057]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:35.201]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:31:35.961 --> 00:31:44.484]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:31:46.124 --> 00:31:54.668]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:06.653]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowarslife.
[00:32:07.194 --> 00:32:14.597]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:15.297 --> 00:32:20.002]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:20.623 --> 00:32:22.525]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:26.569]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.853]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:37.177]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:37.777 --> 00:32:45.021]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:52.525]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:54.186]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:54.547 --> 00:32:56.368]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:57.188 --> 00:33:00.149]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.490]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:06.032 --> 00:33:08.653]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:23.789]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:29.313]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:34.456]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:37.658]  That's right, Owen, in the studios in the ATX.
[00:33:37.678 --> 00:33:39.059]  We take it over here in about five minutes.
[00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:43.862]  He's got a lot of breaking news, a lot of video clips, a lot of key things to get into, but here's the bottom line.
[00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:52.017]  We're witnessing massive historical things happen in positive ways, in very amazing ways, in miraculous ways.
[00:33:52.957 --> 00:33:54.719]  We're discovering the secrets of the universe.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.701]  So many amazing things are happening.
[00:33:57.442 --> 00:34:04.368]  But at the same time, IQs are dropping, fertility is dropping, people are more lazy.
[00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:09.894]  Every metric shows that this civilization, just like space travel, no gravity,
[00:34:10.723 --> 00:34:12.304]  Destroys the mind, destroys the body.
[00:34:12.824 --> 00:34:17.665]  And then you've got the globalists in all their major statements and white papers admitting they've given up on us.
[00:34:17.785 --> 00:34:19.226]  And that's putting it kindly.
[00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:20.646]  I don't think they ever believed in us.
[00:34:21.187 --> 00:34:23.247]  And they're just saying, let's just exacerbate all this.
[00:34:23.307 --> 00:34:26.908]  Let's accelerate the collapse and then build a new civilization on top of it.
[00:34:27.509 --> 00:34:31.350]  But then I look at the globalists, they're the most inbred, hateful, twisted, evil people.
[00:34:33.044 --> 00:34:39.965]  The most selfish people I've ever seen, and they're the ones creating all the out-of-control, genetically engineered systems.
[00:34:40.005 --> 00:34:42.146]  They're the ones with all the leaking reactors.
[00:34:42.166 --> 00:34:45.566]  They're the ones that seem like they actually just want to destroy the planet.
[00:34:46.386 --> 00:34:58.209]  So their whole statement about building a world government to stop war and build this utopia, that's for the mid-level minions under them, the PhDs and others of academia at the highest levels that actually man this system.
[00:34:58.709 --> 00:34:59.709]  That's why I'm so frustrated.
[00:35:00.535 --> 00:35:03.917]  This is an admitted breakaway civilization, a technocracy.
[00:35:04.618 --> 00:35:07.320]  I told people that 20 years ago because it was in their own reports.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.842]  Now, about three years ago, they said from Davos, we're a technocracy.
[00:35:11.302 --> 00:35:16.085]  We believe in appointing presidents and prime ministers, and we believe in cutting off goods to the public.
[00:35:16.105 --> 00:35:18.227]  They're lazy and stupid, and we believe in austerity.
[00:35:19.662 --> 00:35:21.103]  That's a statement they make publicly.
[00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:26.706]  You walk into a Whole Foods, they've got magazines and stuff everywhere about austerity, how fun it is to be poor.
[00:35:27.107 --> 00:35:34.671]  But then it's owned by a guy that made $37 million last year, and it's a total globalist, and rips everybody off, and gets taxpayer money on every package he ships.
[00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:35.952]  It's a total scammer.
[00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:44.449]  They're just making it cool to be slaves, cool to be failures, because the average leftist is a lazy, hateful, nihilistic loser.
[00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:49.410]  That's what happens when you're lazy and stupid and don't build your body or build your mind or achieve things.
[00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.531]  You turn into a spoiled brat.
[00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:52.611]  Then you turn into a criminal and a psychopath.
[00:35:53.672 --> 00:35:55.913]  Almost all these serial killers are little spoiled rotten brats.
[00:35:57.313 --> 00:35:59.314]  So we know historically what we're facing.
[00:35:59.354 --> 00:36:05.576]  We have created incredible prosperity, our forebearers did, with all their ingenuity, all their science, all their commitment, everything.
[00:36:06.514 --> 00:36:15.819]  And then now, a bunch of spoiled rotten people taking it over, and they look at those of us who aren't perfect compared to our ancestors, but are still strong and somewhat trying to be noble.
[00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:18.101]  At least we're trying to be honest and good and decent.
[00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:22.683]  And they see us not being nasty and being liars as weakness.
[00:36:23.484 --> 00:36:28.127]  And all they think at a subconscious level of projection is they hate themselves.
[00:36:28.707 --> 00:36:35.591]  So if the light could be extinguished, if they could pull us down, if they could defeat us, then somehow they might be successful if they could capture
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.741]  The civilization.
[00:36:38.121 --> 00:36:42.323]  If they could get control of it, they could then rule it.
[00:36:42.823 --> 00:36:44.524]  They could then be somebody.
[00:36:44.564 --> 00:36:46.725]  But only after we fall.
[00:36:47.266 --> 00:36:48.426]  They're anti-free market.
[00:36:48.947 --> 00:36:50.107]  They're anti-competition.
[00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:53.689]  And the very worst souls have gotten control of human development.
[00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:56.331]  And that's why I call this the war for the future.
[00:36:57.011 --> 00:37:00.713]  So I try to publish a book with one of the top writers alive.
[00:37:01.837 --> 00:37:04.207]  He's had, what, four or five number one New York Times bestsellers.
[00:37:04.247 --> 00:37:05.753]  Everything else he does is in the top ten.
[00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:07.259]  And they call.
[00:37:08.286 --> 00:37:09.447]  They call his publisher.
[00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:10.848]  They call his ad agency.
[00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:11.948]  They try to get him fired.
[00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:13.249]  They threaten everybody.
[00:37:13.489 --> 00:37:15.651]  He goes, my God, I've never even heard of something like this.
[00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:19.553]  We'll still get it published, but this is insane.
[00:37:19.994 --> 00:37:21.254]  Then they come after our sponsors.
[00:37:21.535 --> 00:37:23.136]  Then they lie about us and try to destroy us.
[00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:28.739]  Then they have people on CNN saying the guy that shot Scalise did a good job on with Wolf Blitzer.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:29.920]  Think about that.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.943]  These people are wound up wimps, like Wolf Blitzer and everybody, and Phil Mudd.
[00:37:34.963 --> 00:37:35.904]  I'm not killing the president.
[00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:37.040]  But you know what?
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.020]  The bigger wimps is us.
[00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:42.044]  Putting up with them like they're a joke, or, oh, they'll be contained.
[00:37:42.064 --> 00:37:42.785]  No, they won't.
[00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:45.587]  They will slit our throats if they get a chance.
[00:37:46.088 --> 00:37:52.994]  Politically, economically, and then physically, because it's weak, disgusting, little globalist punks.
[00:37:53.194 --> 00:37:56.917]  They always gather together in history to take over and to rule.
[00:37:57.398 --> 00:38:00.601]  And, of course, almost all of them get destroyed and killed by whoever they help come to power.
[00:38:01.001 --> 00:38:01.762]  That's the story of history.
[00:38:02.853 --> 00:38:03.073]  I think so.
[00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:25.648]  Ended up being killed.
[00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:38.853]  So those of you that lower the drawbridge to think you're so cool, get money from the Communist Chinese and Soros and Saudi Arabia and the EU and this abomination Pope that literally says Communist China is the essence of Christianity and will teach us all.
[00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:51.097]  They've all joined forces with a billion and a half people and the robot factories and the suicide factories, and they think they're going to win with that leveraging power between the banks and Hollywood and Communist China and the Vatican and the EU.
[00:38:51.377 --> 00:38:52.517]  But they're all trash.
[00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:53.378]  We're good to go.
[00:39:11.132 --> 00:39:11.954]  That needs to happen.
[00:39:11.994 --> 00:39:14.659]  That's why they're so incredibly scared.
[00:39:14.899 --> 00:39:21.292]  The real collaborators of globalism are afraid that we're going to start working with other Christian nations to stop radical Islam's takeover.
[00:39:21.893 --> 00:39:22.775]  And that was the final piece.
[00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:41.359]  The globalist occupied Catholic Church, the communist Chinese, radical Islam, the EU, Hollywood, leftists everywhere are all combined in a public conspiracy against the West and against free market to capture it and bring it down once and for all so that people will stop wanting to be prosperous and stop wanting to be free.
[00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:47.564]  This is an attack on the Renaissance, an attack on Christianity itself, an attack on anything that's upperly mobile.
[00:39:47.584 --> 00:39:50.206]  They want you alone and stupid and dumb.
[00:39:50.746 --> 00:39:51.547]  We're good to go.
[00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:13.497]  We know that if we capitulate, we will go into the dark night.
[00:40:13.857 --> 00:40:15.458]  It will be the absolute nightmare.
[00:40:15.758 --> 00:40:18.239]  And they will have their way with us and our families, make no mistake.
[00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:24.763]  That is their absolute lust, as little chicken-necked, cowardly pieces of trash who want to dominate real men and real women.
[00:40:25.123 --> 00:40:26.183]  This is what you're facing.
[00:40:27.044 --> 00:40:29.125]  People that lust after dominating you.
[00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:31.246]  As a noble person, you don't want to dominate other people.
[00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:33.047]  You want to be left alone and build your own systems.
[00:40:33.307 --> 00:40:34.328]  And we have built the systems.
[00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:52.128]  They're lusting every minute over controlling you, and over binding you, and over running your life, and running your children, and pumping you full of chemicals and biologicals so you're sterile, and just ruling over everything because of the nasty evil people they are that serve their father Lucifer, the devil, the old serpent.
[00:40:52.328 --> 00:40:57.072]  And it's all real, and it's happening, and it's going on right now.
[00:40:57.811 --> 00:40:59.152]  And so this is the great fight.
[00:40:59.613 --> 00:41:00.153]  This is it.
[00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:01.955]  And I am so honored to be here.
[00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:08.961]  You know, other veterans and people have to fight and die to try to defend some idea of freedom, usually being misguided by globalists, but still, their heart was right.
[00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:14.076]  But we get to actually fight against the New World Order, global government itself, now out in the open.
[00:41:14.296 --> 00:41:16.938]  We get to actually change the world and change the future for better.
[00:41:17.198 --> 00:41:20.600]  We actually have a chance of beating this with God's help.
[00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:22.742]  So, that's all we have.
[00:41:22.782 --> 00:41:26.224]  Lay down and be slaves, or stand up and fight and have a chance to take this back.
[00:41:26.544 --> 00:41:27.345]  We will win.
[00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:33.452]  But we must be serious, we must be focused, and we must understand how serious the situation is.
[00:41:33.513 --> 00:41:40.642]  So many strongmen, I know, are busy just at their own companies, their own businesses, and they're too good, you know, to even involve themselves.
[00:41:42.128 --> 00:41:43.629]  Fighting the leftists and the other trash.
[00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:44.569]  You have to.
[00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:50.973]  And it's going to be your fault if we lose this thing that so many men sat there and decided, well, I don't know how to do it.
[00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:52.153]  I don't want to stick my head up.
[00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:53.794]  And, you know, I don't want to be involved.
[00:41:53.854 --> 00:41:54.895]  You've got to do it.
[00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:56.035]  You've got to get involved.
[00:41:56.335 --> 00:42:03.259]  And the bare minimum you can do is spread the videos, spread the articles, spread the links, start your own website, start your own YouTube.
[00:42:04.213 --> 00:42:08.637]  Share our videos, share our articles, and buy the products.
[00:42:08.657 --> 00:42:10.058]  30-80% off, free shipping store-wide.
[00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:12.160]  They financially hate the fact.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.303]  They've targeted our supplements, they've targeted our t-shirts, they've targeted posters we sell.
[00:42:16.744 --> 00:42:22.108]  They sue us at every level, so we can't even provide products, but we're still winning, despite it, because it's all frivolous.
[00:42:22.509 --> 00:42:27.513]  And still, despite the fact that our courts have problems, the stuff they're filing is so frivolous, it's being defeated easily.
[00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:28.774]  But it takes money.
[00:42:29.094 --> 00:42:30.936]  So this is World War 4.
[00:42:31.256 --> 00:42:33.919]  A 21st century information and economic war.
[00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:36.882]  We're going to go to break and come back with Owens Troyer for the balance of the transmission.
[00:42:36.902 --> 00:42:37.863]  He's got so much to cover.
[00:42:38.043 --> 00:42:44.870]  But whether you're listening to us on local stations, on AM and FM or TV, or watching live feeds, tell folks about it right now and spread those links.
[00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:45.550]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.253]  Because if you're watching this transmission or listening, you are the resistance.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:14.082]  We've got a bunch of specials running right now that are, in some cases, the biggest we've ever had.
[00:43:14.962 --> 00:43:17.443]  Because I want people to experience how good these products are.
[00:43:17.463 --> 00:43:26.206]  Because we're being censored, because we're being attacked, I ran a bunch of products, 50% off, like the Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, and like the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula and others.
[00:43:26.286 --> 00:43:27.086]  Those sold out!
[00:43:27.286 --> 00:43:33.308]  So we've got 20% off on super high-quality body armor, including backpack inserts that are so important for yourself and your children.
[00:43:33.368 --> 00:43:35.949]  This is something we're just out around town, you name it, it's good to have.
[00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:49.494]  Also, we've got 30-80% off site-wide massive limited-time savings as part of this Operation Paul Revere to defend the First Amendment, defend internet freedom, and of course, on top of all of that, we're going to do this so we can defend the Second Amendment.
[00:43:49.534 --> 00:43:50.674]  We need your financial support.
[00:43:50.714 --> 00:43:55.036]  So if you need water filtration, air filtration, you name it, it's all 30-80% off.
[00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:56.356]  Almost all items.
[00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:59.538]  There's a few things where we're making like 30% profit on food.
[00:43:59.578 --> 00:44:00.738]  You can't 30% off or it's at cost.
[00:44:00.778 --> 00:44:01.678]  They won't even let you do that.
[00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:09.761]  So there's a few things in there that are regular price because they're already so low, but we already only mark stuff up at regular sell price ads.
[00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:12.062]  A hundred percent markup, but we're never at a hundred percent.
[00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.863]  We're usually at about fifty percent off markups.
[00:44:13.903 --> 00:44:14.883]  We're talking fifty percent.
[00:44:15.003 --> 00:44:19.325]  Everybody else is three, four times markup, and I get it with taxes, regulations, the bureaucracy.
[00:44:19.345 --> 00:44:24.327]  You're running any company, you get lawsuits, you know, just all sorts of, you know, crazy fake stuff, especially if you're InfoWars.
[00:44:24.347 --> 00:44:26.407]  So what I'm saying is, we need your support.
[00:44:26.427 --> 00:44:27.088]  We make it easy.
[00:44:27.468 --> 00:44:30.269]  Thirty percent off almost all items site-wide to help.
[00:44:30.729 --> 00:44:35.793]  Just very important as an independent voice here.
[00:44:36.213 --> 00:44:51.683]  You know, over the last several years, your organization and mine have both become very, very mainstream producers of many health-enhancing products.
[00:44:51.723 --> 00:44:56.146]  And I gotta say, the value of what you're offering people is quite extraordinary.
[00:44:56.186 --> 00:44:59.669]  Because if they go into a retail channel, there's so much markup in the retail channel.
[00:45:00.129 --> 00:45:02.652]  That the ingredients have to be really, really cheapened.
[00:45:03.073 --> 00:45:06.096]  If it's, you know, at a Whole Foods or at a grocery store or something like that.
[00:45:06.116 --> 00:45:11.422]  The value of the ingredients that you're putting in because you're selling directly to people is really extraordinary.
[00:45:12.083 --> 00:45:17.629]  I know I've got some of your products in our lab that we're looking at and the potency that we're seeing right now is super high.
[00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:24.394]  I mean, I know you didn't have me here to endorse your product line, but... No, I appreciate you doing it, because I... I mean, look, I know where to target.
[00:45:24.434 --> 00:45:25.474]  Plus, I want to sell good stuff.
[00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:28.556]  We just go out to the industry leaders and say, what's the strongest turmeric out there?
[00:45:28.877 --> 00:45:33.900]  Well, 450 milligrams with a 90-something curcumin and... I mean, you're an expert in all this.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.341]  That's as high as the industry gets.
[00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:36.281]  We go with that.
[00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:39.503]  A lot of folks, as you said, they're going to want to mark stuff up six, seven times.
[00:45:39.523 --> 00:45:40.944]  They want it to be low-priced.
[00:45:40.964 --> 00:45:43.526]  So it's 30 bucks, but there's a dollar of product.
[00:45:43.946 --> 00:45:45.348]  Not, you know, $10 a product.
[00:45:45.368 --> 00:45:46.068]  We see that all the time.
[00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:46.849]  All the time.
[00:45:47.209 --> 00:45:55.197]  And it's the curcuminoids, and if you, you know, there's so much amazing scientific research and medical research out there on so many of the benefits of curcumin.
[00:45:55.217 --> 00:45:57.659]  You know, I think we published stories today on that.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.564]  You know, for sports, for fitness, for recovery, for... There's a lot we're not supposed to say, but it's known.
[00:46:02.584 --> 00:46:03.024]  Exactly.
[00:46:03.084 --> 00:46:04.005]  There's things we can't say.
[00:46:04.065 --> 00:46:04.706]  Both of us can't say.
[00:46:04.746 --> 00:46:05.487]  Because the country's so free.
[00:46:05.527 --> 00:46:05.707]  Yeah.
[00:46:06.027 --> 00:46:10.751]  You know, there's thousands of studies of what it does, and it's the ultimate antioxidant.
[00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.773]  And so, look, it's sold out in a month.
[00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:16.356]  I did 50% off, and we still made, like, you know, $6, $7 a bottle.
[00:46:16.396 --> 00:46:19.139]  Now it's gonna be regular price, and it's still a good deal.
[00:46:19.159 --> 00:46:21.461]  But I want folks to see how good it is.
[00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:24.123]  So, you know, that's sold out.
[00:46:24.183 --> 00:46:25.545]  The point is, is that we've got
[00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:35.052]  Uh, clearance apparel 80% off, three-way 50% off, Aegis body armor 20% off, InfoWars life of mind and body, uh, that is 40% off.
[00:46:35.112 --> 00:46:36.353]  And I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:45.461]  All I'm saying is, please support the broadcast and take advantage of this and let the globalists know no matter how hardcore their attacks are, you're gonna continue to support us because they just...
[00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:50.323]  They just had a big site yesterday claiming they weren't sponsoring us anymore, and they never sponsored us.
[00:46:50.563 --> 00:46:53.525]  But they were trying to get other sponsors to pull.
[00:46:53.545 --> 00:46:54.406]  It was a total hoax.
[00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:54.786]  Of course.
[00:46:55.106 --> 00:46:55.886]  That's what they do all the time.
[00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:57.267]  It's all a disinfo war.
[00:47:06.952 --> 00:47:09.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.678 --> 00:47:29.182]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:29.682 --> 00:47:33.024]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:34.324 --> 00:47:40.328]  I've got stacks of news to get to, and I will get to it.
[00:47:42.629 --> 00:47:49.973]  Whether it be Seattle confiscating guns, making a dangerous precedent on
[00:47:51.167 --> 00:48:08.136]  A homeless man's truck being his home, whether it's an entire stack of news on what's going on right now, what the left is doing to endanger us, another stack of news on what the left has already done that's blowing up in their face.
[00:48:09.556 --> 00:48:10.957]  So we've got all that going on.
[00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:19.001]  We're going to have updates on the teenager that tried to detonate an explosive at a high school in
[00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:22.631]  Utah.
[00:48:24.132 --> 00:48:32.457]  And I'm about to go to these clips of Jeff Sessions as he just spoke, and this is on the heels of the DOJ suing California over interference with immigration enforcement.
[00:48:33.198 --> 00:48:46.926]  Of course, the mayor in Oakland, Libby Schaaf, Shifty Schaaf, she warned lawbreakers in California, the police were coming, that's obstruction of justice.
[00:48:48.188 --> 00:48:57.630]  And it turns out that some of the people that she let get away were people that had robbery convictions and sex conventions.
[00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.490]  So way to go Libby Schaaf.
[00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:03.151]  You're now colluding with criminals.
[00:49:04.551 --> 00:49:06.352]  You need to be sued.
[00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:07.972]  You need to be locked up.
[00:49:10.813 --> 00:49:17.254]  See, these radical leftists belong in jail when they break the law.
[00:49:18.473 --> 00:49:21.214]  But they get away with it because it's virtuous.
[00:49:22.094 --> 00:49:24.295]  I'm just being virtuous to these non-citizens.
[00:49:24.315 --> 00:49:25.415]  Don't we feel bad for them?
[00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:33.958]  Really, you feel bad for the criminals that broke the law, and then many of them had sex and robbery convictions, and now they're roaming the streets free!
[00:49:34.558 --> 00:49:35.339]  Shifty Schaff!
[00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:36.519]  So thanks a lot!
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.680]  But I want to just talk about something real quick.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:44.582]  What is Alex talking about when he says, the fall of America?
[00:49:44.662 --> 00:49:45.662]  What is the fall?
[00:49:46.222 --> 00:49:47.883]  What is the fall that the globalists want?
[00:49:49.002 --> 00:49:49.582]  Well, think about it.
[00:49:50.623 --> 00:49:52.565]  They'd like to confiscate the guns.
[00:49:52.605 --> 00:49:53.726]  They want to do a gun grab.
[00:49:53.746 --> 00:49:54.867]  They want to end the Second Amendment.
[00:49:55.347 --> 00:49:56.328]  That's going on now.
[00:49:57.009 --> 00:49:58.570]  They want to attack free speech.
[00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.011]  They want to censor free thinkers.
[00:50:00.031 --> 00:50:01.473]  They want to end the First Amendment.
[00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:03.114]  That's going on now.
[00:50:03.755 --> 00:50:04.796]  They have their
[00:50:06.247 --> 00:50:13.951]  Soviet-style, communist-style, fake news, propaganda news on air, lying and deceiving the public.
[00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:15.252]  That's going on.
[00:50:15.732 --> 00:50:19.975]  They want to have no borders, so that you don't actually have a nation-state.
[00:50:20.962 --> 00:50:22.023]  Anybody can flood in.
[00:50:22.183 --> 00:50:24.684]  Criminals, terrorists, what have you.
[00:50:25.204 --> 00:50:26.405]  But it's all virtuous.
[00:50:26.445 --> 00:50:26.985]  It's all good.
[00:50:27.025 --> 00:50:31.147]  We feel bad even though there's no actual security there.
[00:50:31.747 --> 00:50:32.828]  So it's a wide open border.
[00:50:32.848 --> 00:50:34.329]  So you really don't even have a country.
[00:50:34.369 --> 00:50:35.089]  Then they can vote.
[00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:36.270]  You don't even have a real election.
[00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:38.351]  How about a
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.160]  A culture that is poisoned.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:50.722]  A culture that poisons the youth with just all kinds of trash on television, trash in the media, and then that gets flooded into the mainstream.
[00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:52.703]  So now you've poisoned the youth.
[00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.403]  Now you've poisoned the culture.
[00:50:55.443 --> 00:50:57.964]  About not even being able to procreate.
[00:50:58.384 --> 00:51:06.966]  So now you've got chemicals in the food and water and everything that causes people to be homosexual or causes people to want to be transsexual or
[00:51:08.817 --> 00:51:10.439]  Let's say that that's not an issue.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.002]  It's causing males to be infertile.
[00:51:13.943 --> 00:51:14.283]  Okay?
[00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:17.707]  And then it's harder for women to even have kids.
[00:51:17.748 --> 00:51:18.208]  So there you go.
[00:51:18.228 --> 00:51:20.210]  So just destroy the ability to even have kids.
[00:51:21.428 --> 00:51:24.151]  How about the indoctrination of the youth in the education system?
[00:51:24.191 --> 00:51:34.962]  So now you have public education systems indoctrinating the youth into hating America, hating white people, being totally, oh, full liberal, even though it's not actually liberal.
[00:51:35.102 --> 00:51:40.907]  And then you see the hate that is sown in the public education system, specifically in the universities.
[00:51:42.366 --> 00:51:43.067]  How about the health?
[00:51:43.127 --> 00:51:50.693]  How about the culture of health, where now cancer rates are soaring up, people are more mentally ill than ever, people are more obese than ever.
[00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:54.036]  So you've got the health, so the deteriorating health of the country.
[00:51:54.356 --> 00:51:55.777]  You've got a totally corrupt government.
[00:51:56.057 --> 00:51:58.239]  Who's going to deny that, that the FBI is corrupt?
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.820]  No one's denying that.
[00:51:59.881 --> 00:52:00.261]  The U.S.
[00:52:00.301 --> 00:52:01.402]  government's totally been corrupt.
[00:52:01.602 --> 00:52:02.343]  So you've got that.
[00:52:02.863 --> 00:52:03.824]  And then the death cult.
[00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:12.375]  With the violence in the streets, with the violence in the media, and then with abortion happening, just millions of babies aborted.
[00:52:13.276 --> 00:52:16.518]  I think one-third of my generation was aborted.
[00:52:17.439 --> 00:52:23.163]  So you want to talk about gun control saving lives, how about abortion saving 33% of my generation?
[00:52:27.423 --> 00:52:37.711]  So that's the fall that Alex talks about, that the globalists have been working on for decades and decades, and now we've reached the precipice where we're finally fighting back and saying, no, we're not going to fall.
[00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:39.312]  We're going to pick ourselves back up.
[00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:42.654]  We're going to reform this country and we're going to make America great again.
[00:52:43.055 --> 00:52:44.656]  They're trying to drown us.
[00:52:45.176 --> 00:52:49.119]  They're trying to put their boot on our head and drown us and stomp us out.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.921]  That's the fall they need to bring in the global government.
[00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:53.622]  Now, let's go to Jeff Sessions.
[00:52:54.724 --> 00:52:56.005]  First, actually, let's go to Trump.
[00:52:56.205 --> 00:52:57.306]  This was from yesterday.
[00:52:57.326 --> 00:53:13.739]  The Swedish Prime Minister was in town, and they did a press conference, and Trump said right to his face, and this is, I mean, folks, what's happening in Sweden, it should be a national news story every day with what's happened with the open borders and the illegal immigration there, just destroying Sweden.
[00:53:13.779 --> 00:53:18.023]  I mean, rape is up, terrorist attacks, police stations getting bombed.
[00:53:18.383 --> 00:53:19.224]  It's insane.
[00:53:19.264 --> 00:53:20.325]  It should be a huge story.
[00:53:20.685 --> 00:53:24.408]  Here's Trump saying to the Swedish Prime Minister that they have an immigration problem.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:33.522]  Mr. President, I know that you follow the development in Sweden closely, especially when it comes to immigration politics.
[00:53:34.202 --> 00:53:38.763]  Now that you've spent some time with our Prime Minister, how do you view Sweden in general?
[00:53:38.803 --> 00:53:41.964]  What is your take, and also on our immigration politics?
[00:53:42.524 --> 00:53:42.724]  Thank you.
[00:53:42.744 --> 00:53:45.225]  I think you have a wonderful Prime Minister, I have to say.
[00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:46.345]  We've gotten to know each other.
[00:53:47.506 --> 00:53:49.546]  Certainly you have a problem with the immigration.
[00:53:49.606 --> 00:53:51.086]  It's caused problems in Sweden.
[00:53:51.146 --> 00:53:52.847]  I was one of the first ones to say it.
[00:53:53.909 --> 00:54:04.696]  Yeah, and they said it was fake news and then he was right.
[00:54:06.056 --> 00:54:07.798]  And you just look at the news that comes out of Sweden.
[00:54:07.818 --> 00:54:09.579]  Again, police stations getting bombed.
[00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:15.362]  They have these schools for the migrants that come in and then five years later they're boarded up.
[00:54:15.402 --> 00:54:17.383]  They got barbed wire fences.
[00:54:17.423 --> 00:54:18.424]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:54:18.624 --> 00:54:19.385]  Rape epidemics.
[00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:22.747]  So yeah, that's an immigration problem because it's dumb policy.
[00:54:23.757 --> 00:54:32.163]  Now let's go to Jeff Sessions, calling out the liberals, calling out the Democrats, for putting the lives of officers in danger.
[00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:42.111]  For example, the mayor of Oakland has been actively seeking to help illegal aliens avoid apprehension by ICE.
[00:54:43.172 --> 00:54:49.016]  Her actions support those who flout the law and boldly validates illegality.
[00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:52.399]  There's no other way to interpret those remarks.
[00:54:53.442 --> 00:54:59.885]  To make matters worse, the elected lieutenant governor of the state praised her for doing so.
[00:55:00.585 --> 00:55:04.627]  Bragging about and encouraging the obstruction of our law enforcement.
[00:55:05.327 --> 00:55:06.748]  Gangsterism.
[00:55:06.948 --> 00:55:08.188]  Full-on gangsters.
[00:55:09.809 --> 00:55:12.990]  The left are a bunch of lawless criminal thugs now.
[00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:15.371]  Led by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:16.372]  What do you think this is?
[00:55:17.546 --> 00:55:18.626]  Yeah, so lock her up!
[00:55:18.646 --> 00:55:19.847]  You know what?
[00:55:19.867 --> 00:55:20.347]  Hold on.
[00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:21.087]  Just pause right there.
[00:55:21.107 --> 00:55:21.948]  Pause right there.
[00:55:21.968 --> 00:55:23.168]  I'll tell you what.
[00:55:23.248 --> 00:55:24.849]  I'll tell you what.
[00:55:24.869 --> 00:55:27.750]  This is what the people are sick of right here.
[00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:48.497]  Now, Jeff Sessions, it's nice to see that he's still alive and he has a pulse.
[00:55:48.977 --> 00:55:49.478]  But you know what?
[00:55:49.618 --> 00:55:50.278]  This is nothing.
[00:55:50.318 --> 00:55:50.659]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:51.439 --> 00:55:52.160]  This is fluff.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.521]  This is an embarrassment.
[00:55:54.422 --> 00:56:07.712]  If I'm standing on the street corner as a lookout for a gang and I see the cops rolling up and I call the gang house and I say, you better roll out, the cops are coming, I'm going to jail, okay?
[00:56:08.092 --> 00:56:10.374]  Why isn't Libby Schaaf going to jail?
[00:56:11.462 --> 00:56:15.424]  So I'm glad that the DOJ has decided to sue California over this.
[00:56:15.544 --> 00:56:17.245]  I'm glad that Sessions decided to give this speech.
[00:56:17.846 --> 00:56:18.866]  You're still cucking.
[00:56:19.287 --> 00:56:20.207]  You're still a wuss.
[00:56:20.848 --> 00:56:22.969]  Libby Schaaf belongs in jail.
[00:56:23.249 --> 00:56:25.130]  She belongs in front of a judge.
[00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:32.614]  And until you do that, you're going to have the same mentality that politicians are above the law.
[00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:34.796]  Do you understand the problem here?
[00:56:36.089 --> 00:56:36.830]  That's the problem.
[00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:41.034]  Politicians being protected because of their politicians.
[00:56:41.314 --> 00:56:42.815]  Libby Schaaf belongs in jail.
[00:56:43.116 --> 00:56:54.686]  If any other citizen in California calls criminals to warn them the cops are coming, they're going to jail for aiding and abetting in a crime, but Libby Schaaf gets away with it.
[00:56:56.528 --> 00:56:57.109]  Finish the clip.
[00:56:57.873 --> 00:57:01.937]  He did have the exact opposite effect, close quote.
[00:57:02.417 --> 00:57:04.880]  And I think that's a fair criticism and statement.
[00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:13.909]  According to acting director Homan, ICE failed to make 800 arrests that would have been made if the manager had made her statement.
[00:57:14.489 --> 00:57:19.070]  Those are 800 wanted criminals that are now at large in that community.
[00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:30.593]  800 wanted criminals that ICE will now have to pursue by other means with more difficulty in dangerous situations all because of one irresponsible action.
[00:57:31.773 --> 00:57:32.514]  Yeah, irresponsible.
[00:57:32.534 --> 00:57:34.054]  She knew exactly what she was doing.
[00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:36.710]  So lock her up!
[00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:40.612]  If any other citizen would have done what Libby Schaaf did, they'd be in jail!
[00:57:52.813 --> 00:57:56.634]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.

[00:58:09.938 --> 00:58:13.039]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:58:13.299 --> 00:58:22.622]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:58:22.782 --> 00:58:25.123]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:58:25.343 --> 00:58:27.043]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:58:27.243 --> 00:58:29.884]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[00:58:30.144 --> 00:58:34.686]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[00:58:35.006 --> 00:58:41.068]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:58:41.508 --> 00:58:46.051]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:47.652]  That helps with focus, too.
[00:58:48.093 --> 00:58:49.093]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[00:58:49.594 --> 00:58:53.696]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:58:54.117 --> 00:58:58.160]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.981]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:59:00.241 --> 00:59:00.881]  For the better.
[00:59:01.302 --> 00:59:05.084]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[00:59:05.485 --> 00:59:07.166]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:59:07.566 --> 00:59:08.427]  I hope this lasts.
[00:59:09.287 --> 00:59:11.349]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:59:11.649 --> 00:59:17.754]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:22.999]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.782]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:59:27.382 --> 00:59:32.407]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:59:32.967 --> 00:59:34.768]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.569]  Not anymore.
[00:59:35.949 --> 00:59:37.130]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[00:59:37.711 --> 00:59:39.532]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:59:39.772 --> 00:59:41.153]  I will definitely buy this again.

[01:00:11.584 --> 01:00:12.505]  See, here's the problem.
[01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:15.286]  Here's why Americans are so fed up.
[01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:19.508]  Because Hillary Clinton gets to break the law and nothing happens.
[01:00:19.568 --> 01:00:21.769]  Barack Obama gets to break the law and nothing happens.
[01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:23.851]  Lois Lerner gets to break the law and nothing happens.
[01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:25.952]  Libby Schaaf gets to break the law and nothing happens.
[01:00:27.392 --> 01:00:27.653]  And then...
[01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:32.017]  I get lectured on how Trump is the bad guy.
[01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:33.498]  You say, well, okay, what has Trump done?
[01:00:33.518 --> 01:00:34.819]  They don't have anything.
[01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:35.779]  What do they say?
[01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.741]  Well, he colluded with Russia.
[01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:39.081]  What evidence do you have?
[01:00:39.422 --> 01:00:40.702]  Well, he's a racist.
[01:00:41.563 --> 01:00:42.364]  What evidence do you have?
[01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.285]  Well, he's got a potty mouth.
[01:00:45.405 --> 01:00:47.006]  Okay, well, what's wrong with having a potty mouth?
[01:00:47.046 --> 01:00:50.929]  I'm sure that, you know, you don't sometimes say everything that's politically correct.
[01:00:52.199 --> 01:00:54.780]  Oh, but then Hillary Clinton uses the Clinton Foundation.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.980]  They got all this money coming in.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.141]  She's got multiple wings, multiple satellites.
[01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:02.182]  She's colluding with Saudi Arabia, colluding with China, you know, colluding with Russia.
[01:01:02.222 --> 01:01:03.962]  She's got wide open servers.
[01:01:03.982 --> 01:01:07.243]  People can just come in and steal secrets, classified documents.
[01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.263]  Oh, that's fine!
[01:01:08.843 --> 01:01:13.084]  Obama uses Lois Lerner and the IRS to target their political opposition.
[01:01:13.204 --> 01:01:14.044]  Oh, that's fine!
[01:01:14.445 --> 01:01:19.706]  Obama administration uses the FBI and the DOJ and the FISA course to target their political opposition.
[01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:21.187]  Oh, that's fine!
[01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:27.353]  Libby Schaaf warns all the criminals in Oakland that ICE is coming for them, and then they get away.
[01:01:27.373 --> 01:01:28.895]  Oh, that's fine!
[01:01:28.955 --> 01:01:30.276]  Yeah, no problem!
[01:01:30.516 --> 01:01:33.379]  But shut InfoWars down, because they might cover it.
[01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:40.066]  So here's more from Jeff Sessions, which again... Wow, Jeff Sessions!
[01:01:40.106 --> 01:01:40.466]  Woo!
[01:01:40.506 --> 01:01:41.307]  He's got a pulse!
[01:01:41.347 --> 01:01:42.448]  He's finally a rose!
[01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:44.724]  Great speech, Jeff.
[01:01:45.044 --> 01:01:46.865]  Put Libby Schaaf in jail!
[01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:49.686]  If you want to stop these criminals, put them in jail!
[01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.387]  It's like common sense!
[01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:59.712]  So here's Jeff Sessions saying that the officials in California have boldly validated illegality.
[01:02:01.193 --> 01:02:03.614]  By California, we have a problem.
[01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:12.339]  A series of actions and events has occurred here that directly and adversely impact the work of our federal offices.
[01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:22.279]  For example, the mayor of Oakland has been actively seeking to help illegal aliens avoid apprehension by ICE.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:29.128]  Her actions support those who flout the law and boldly validates illegality.
[01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:32.606]  There's no other way to interpret those remarks.
[01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:44.752]  To make matters worse, the elected lieutenant governor of the state praised her for doing so, bragging about and encouraging the obstruction of our law enforcement.
[01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:53.196]  And the law is... I'm afraid this is an embarrassment to the proud state of California.
[01:02:53.656 --> 01:02:58.859]  The proud state of California that Democrats have turned into a literal shh-hole.
[01:03:01.087 --> 01:03:01.407]  Whoa!
[01:03:01.928 --> 01:03:04.671]  Remember the Clean Needle Program enacted in California?
[01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.353]  The Clean Needle Program?
[01:03:06.653 --> 01:03:09.156]  Yeah, you know where those clean needles are now?
[01:03:09.796 --> 01:03:12.839]  They're infected with hepatitis laying around in the streets!
[01:03:15.803 --> 01:03:17.785]  That's what the Democrats have done to California.
[01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.569]  Here's another clip from Jeff Sessions.
[01:03:23.516 --> 01:03:26.240]  Saying that we have to have a lawful system of immigration.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.823]  See, they say that we're anti-immigration.
[01:03:28.063 --> 01:03:29.125]  We're pro-immigration.
[01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:30.467]  They're anti-immigration.
[01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:31.409]  They're open borders.
[01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:32.651]  They're anti-immigration.
[01:03:34.974 --> 01:03:35.415]  This is 1984, man.
[01:03:35.455 --> 01:03:36.376]  Just go to the clip.
[01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:41.331]  We are a strong, prosperous, and orderly nation.
[01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:44.894]  California is a great state, so important to America.
[01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:51.939]  And such a nation, such a country as ours, must have a lawful system of immigration.
[01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:57.082]  I'm not aware of any advanced nation who disagrees with that concept.
[01:03:57.803 --> 01:04:04.768]  And let no one contend that we reject immigration and want to wall off America from all immigrants.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.584]  President Trump and the American people know what's happening.
[01:04:09.084 --> 01:04:20.418]  We admit 1.1 million immigrants lawfully to permanent resident status in the United States with a clear path to citizenship, green card status every year.
[01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:22.561]  No nation comes close to that.
[01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:26.850]  Yeah, we take the most refugees too.
[01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:31.652]  So there's Jeff Sessions, the DOJ is suing California over interference with immigration enforcement.
[01:04:31.732 --> 01:04:37.215]  Sanctuary cities need to be made illegal and if you're in government and you allow those, you need to be probably put in jail.
[01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:43.578]  But now the UN Rights Chief says that the EU and the US need to take in more migrants and more DREAMers.
[01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:44.879]  Oh, the U.N.
[01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:45.799]  is telling me this, huh?
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.140]  Oh, it's the U.N.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.121]  So I guess the U.N.
[01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:48.962]  is in charge now.
[01:04:49.422 --> 01:04:59.169]  And they're also forcing a tiny Irish town to increase its population by 33% with open borders and migrants that don't know anything about the language, anything about the culture, anything about the people.
[01:04:59.589 --> 01:05:00.430]  But we're the problem!
[01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.731]  They're destroying the Earth, but we're the problem.
[01:05:03.837 --> 01:05:05.458]  You think our information's hardcore?
[01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:07.059]  You think our focus is brutal?

[01:06:08.723 --> 01:06:11.005]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:17.009]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:17.449 --> 01:06:20.672]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:26.556 --> 01:06:35.062]  We had the guest on that told you the deep state and the globalists and the radical left
[01:06:37.051 --> 01:06:43.934]  In response to the resurgence of America and the election of President Trump, they would target schools.
[01:06:45.554 --> 01:06:46.575]  They would target trains.
[01:06:48.235 --> 01:06:49.016]  And then that happened.
[01:06:49.216 --> 01:06:50.196]  And they targeted trains.
[01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:51.917]  They targeted trains carrying conservatives.
[01:06:52.077 --> 01:06:53.637]  In fact, there was another train wreck yesterday.
[01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:58.279]  Train crashed into a tanker carrying hydraulic acid.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.000]  And you have the Florida shooting.
[01:07:02.661 --> 01:07:02.981]  Now,
[01:07:04.195 --> 01:07:16.861]  You have a teenager who was inspired by ISIS who attempted to detonate a homemade bomb at Pine View High School.
[01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:23.944]  Now, here's my initial reaction to this.
[01:07:26.145 --> 01:07:30.788]  I'm not even gonna really get into the weirdness of the Florida shooting or the weirdness of the Vegas shooting or anything like that.
[01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:33.349]  But if you just look at this story,
[01:07:35.674 --> 01:07:44.920]  And you just focus on this, and you say, how does this teenager in Utah get, quote unquote, inspired by ISIS?
[01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:54.225]  And he spray paints on the school, ISIS is coming, apparently he's an ISIS guy now because ISIS is victorious, right?
[01:07:54.585 --> 01:08:00.529]  He pulls down the American flag at the school, and then raises the ISIS flag.
[01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:03.351]  So how does an individual
[01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:05.712]  Become inspired by ISIS.
[01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:06.972]  I mean, really think about this.
[01:08:07.973 --> 01:08:14.497]  How does this individual become brainwashed into saying ISIS is coming, ISIS is rising, ISIS is about to have their victory?
[01:08:14.877 --> 01:08:15.878]  Who is telling him this?
[01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:17.999]  Where is he getting this?
[01:08:21.181 --> 01:08:24.022]  Well, they say he's inspired on social media.
[01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:24.623]  Okay, well.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.221]  Maybe that's the case.
[01:08:27.261 --> 01:08:28.662]  So then where is Facebook?
[01:08:28.702 --> 01:08:29.543]  Where is Twitter?
[01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:32.345]  I mean, folks, they're watching us.
[01:08:32.565 --> 01:08:32.865]  Hi!
[01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:33.846]  Hi, Facebook!
[01:08:34.747 --> 01:08:35.547]  Hi, YouTube!
[01:08:35.728 --> 01:08:36.428]  Hi!
[01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:37.709]  We're still here!
[01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:38.410]  Hi!
[01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:42.733]  We're still not telling people to go out and bomb people as a part of jihad.
[01:08:42.773 --> 01:08:43.914]  That's not what we do here.
[01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:50.780]  But somebody is, and while you're focused on us, somebody is out there inspiring people to try to blow up their schools.
[01:08:51.658 --> 01:08:56.620]  Others are out there talking about, bragging about how they're going to be a school shooter, and you're obsessed with us!
[01:08:57.421 --> 01:08:58.081]  Hi!
[01:08:58.101 --> 01:08:58.841]  Hi!
[01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:04.204]  Maybe you should focus on the next terrorist that might be warning people on your social media platforms right now.
[01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:06.264]  But nobody asked the question.
[01:09:06.284 --> 01:09:08.705]  I mean, seriously, how does this teenager
[01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:11.802]  Have this thought.
[01:09:11.942 --> 01:09:13.663]  Who is telling him that ISIS is coming?
[01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:16.926]  Who is telling him that ISIS is about to have their victory?
[01:09:17.266 --> 01:09:18.687]  Who is feeding him this propaganda?
[01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:21.970]  And if it is coming on social media, why aren't they doing something about it?
[01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:34.359]  Why are they continuing to censor us, and censor conservatives, and censor Trump supporters, and ignoring people that are being radicalized, or radicalizing people, or warning people they're going to be a school shooter?
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.381]  So the teenager,
[01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:46.178]  Inspired by ISIS, makes an explosive device, says ISIS is coming, thinks he's on the team of victory with ISIS, and then tries to blow up his school.
[01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:52.766]  Here is the authorities in Utah holding a brief press conference to update you on this situation.
[01:09:54.773 --> 01:10:03.078]  Today, just after noon, a student was in a common area at Pineview High School and observed a suspicious item in that area, a backpack that was smoking.
[01:10:04.019 --> 01:10:11.163]  That student found a teacher and reported the observations to the teacher, who then contacted the school resource officer that was on duty in the school.
[01:10:12.364 --> 01:10:19.830]  It happened that they contacted another SRO to respond to the scene right away, who is also a member of the regional bomb unit.
[01:10:20.251 --> 01:10:25.095]  So he responded to evaluate the backpack, as did the school resource officer supervisor.
[01:10:26.075 --> 01:10:31.520]  Once they were able to look at the backpack and determine it, it was initially they evacuated that area.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:41.208]  As soon as they realized that they were dealing with a larger issue and more potential for injury or damage, the decision was made to contact the principal of the school.
[01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:46.600]  And the SRO supervisor coordinated an evacuation of the school with the principal.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:55.562]  Students were escorted to the football stadium where they remained until the end of school day and arrangements were made to get them home.
[01:10:55.922 --> 01:10:56.643]  And pause it right there.
[01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:57.903]  And let's just remember something here.
[01:10:57.943 --> 01:10:59.723]  This is not rhetoric.
[01:11:00.784 --> 01:11:01.644]  Pause it right there, guys.
[01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:03.645]  This is not rhetoric.
[01:11:04.925 --> 01:11:07.786]  The radical left in America has actually allied with ISIS.
[01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:13.794]  And you say, oh, that's absurd, that's crazy, that's your, now you're... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:13.975 --> 01:11:14.355]  Think about it.
[01:11:14.655 --> 01:11:19.858]  Who stands up for radical Islamic terrorists when they do a crime or when they kill people?
[01:11:20.638 --> 01:11:21.118]  The left.
[01:11:21.298 --> 01:11:21.739]  Every time.
[01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:24.320]  And they say it's your fault for reporting on it.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:25.901]  It's your fault for saying it's happening.
[01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:26.941]  You're triggering them.
[01:11:27.762 --> 01:11:28.582]  That's them standing up.
[01:11:28.842 --> 01:11:29.443]  Who enables?
[01:11:30.263 --> 01:11:31.264]  Who enables ISIS?
[01:11:32.435 --> 01:11:38.378]  Well, who was it that flooded money and arms into the Middle East and helped with the proxy wars?
[01:11:38.698 --> 01:11:40.019]  Well, that was the Obama administration.
[01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:41.140]  That was the Bush administration.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:42.680]  Okay.
[01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:47.683]  And now, who is enabling them by having open borders in this country?
[01:11:48.664 --> 01:11:56.808]  And then, I guess if you want to take it a step further and say, social media that's apparently watching everything conservatives are doing are just ignoring radical terrorism going on.
[01:11:58.752 --> 01:12:08.215]  So, yeah, if anyone is radical, if anyone is aligned with ISIS, the radical left and radical Islam is kind of, you know, merging right now.
[01:12:08.235 --> 01:12:09.636]  I mean, just look at Linda Sarsour.
[01:12:10.176 --> 01:12:11.697]  She's totally radical ISIS.
[01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:15.638]  She goes out and she gets a bunch of radical leftists to go out and protest with her.
[01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:23.781]  And then they want to act like you're crazy because you report on Sweden, you show what's going on in Sweden,
[01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:37.272]  Then they say you're an Islamophobe and you say, oh, I'm an Islamophobe because I don't want rape to go up like a thousand percent in my country when you bring in a bunch of radical Islamist refugees that just don't know any better.
[01:12:39.173 --> 01:12:40.173]  That's where they come from.
[01:12:40.213 --> 01:12:45.575]  So they come into Sweden where there's actually a civilization and they just tear it to the ground because they don't know how to behave.
[01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:46.536]  They don't know any better.
[01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.076]  That's what you get.
[01:12:48.236 --> 01:12:49.257]  And that's what the left is doing.
[01:12:49.597 --> 01:12:51.198]  Let's go back to the authorities in Utah.
[01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:54.479]  PIO for the school district discussed those issues.
[01:12:58.297 --> 01:13:00.179]  I'll get through it all and then we'll hit questions, sorry.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:08.908]  So, in response to the observations made, the regional bomb unit was contacted to respond, as was the fire department.
[01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:12.952]  We had responses as well from federal partners.
[01:13:13.012 --> 01:13:14.874]  Why is this going on in my country?
[01:13:15.594 --> 01:13:23.401]  We contacted IHC who has a canine that's trained in detecting explosive or hazardous types of devices.
[01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:33.569]  That employee was off duty but still volunteered or came in to respond and provided resources to our department and the investigators.
[01:13:36.463 --> 01:13:42.387]  A person of interest has been identified at this point and is being interviewed to determine what the circumstances are.
[01:13:42.427 --> 01:13:42.907]  Exactly.
[01:13:42.947 --> 01:13:44.648]  So, pause it right there.
[01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:45.548]  The crew just comes to my ear.
[01:13:45.568 --> 01:13:47.750]  They're like, oh, so this is the opposite of Parkland.
[01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.211]  You actually did your job.
[01:13:49.371 --> 01:13:50.691]  You actually followed through.
[01:13:51.532 --> 01:13:53.253]  We're in Coward County.
[01:13:53.313 --> 01:13:54.154]  They totally blew it.
[01:13:54.674 --> 01:13:54.914]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:55.334 --> 01:13:57.656]  You had, I mean, folks, when you actually counted,
[01:13:59.153 --> 01:14:04.275]  66 different opportunities the authorities had to stop Nicholas Cruz from doing this.
[01:14:04.896 --> 01:14:09.918]  Between the warnings the school had, the FBI had, the police had, the families had, everybody had.
[01:14:10.298 --> 01:14:13.379]  You're counting at least 66 times they could have done something about it.
[01:14:13.499 --> 01:14:14.619]  Nobody did anything.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.621]  At least the ones in authority, they could have done something.
[01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:24.784]  And then here you have the situation in Utah, and they're like, yeah, we responded, we did what we had to do, people put their lives on the line to try to stop this explosive.
[01:14:25.164 --> 01:14:25.704]  Let's let them finish.
[01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:32.836]  In the backpack that had the potential to injure persons or damage property.
[01:14:32.856 --> 01:14:38.541]  I won't be able to go into the nature of that item or any details at this point.
[01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:49.609]  Again, it is an ongoing investigation, but the units investigating that aspect of this incident have confirmed that there was an object in that backpack to cause that concern.
[01:14:51.827 --> 01:14:57.890]  I'd like to, before we go on to questions, there's been a lot of moving parts involved in this incident.
[01:14:58.271 --> 01:15:02.613]  We've had responses, again, from Washington County Sheriff's Office that help support our patrol units.
[01:15:03.173 --> 01:15:07.216]  Our patrol units have been here managing... Okay, let's bring that down.
[01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:18.102]  So again, there are the authorities out there in Utah addressing the media as to what happened with the backpack and the attempted bombing of the school in Utah.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.401]  And of course, what is, I mean, who does backpack bombings?
[01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.361]  Radical Islamic terrorists.
[01:15:25.801 --> 01:15:29.342]  I mean, those are the people that line backpacks with bombs and then detonate them.
[01:15:29.522 --> 01:15:31.562]  Whether it be at concerts, in the streets, now at schools.
[01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:33.803]  But the question is, why?
[01:15:33.903 --> 01:15:35.283]  Why is this happening in my country?
[01:15:35.803 --> 01:15:36.763]  Why do we have the shooters?
[01:15:36.843 --> 01:15:38.204]  Why do we have these people blowing people up?
[01:15:38.524 --> 01:15:39.504]  What is happening in this country?
[01:15:39.524 --> 01:15:43.965]  Why do we have people literally defecating on the streets?
[01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.815]  Masturbating on the subway.
[01:15:46.895 --> 01:15:48.236]  Why is all this going on?
[01:15:48.337 --> 01:15:50.679]  Folks, it's a mental health issue.
[01:15:50.699 --> 01:15:52.461]  This country is mentally ill.
[01:15:53.022 --> 01:15:54.103]  It's mentally sick.
[01:15:54.143 --> 01:15:57.507]  We have to fix our mental health if we're gonna be able to fix anything.
[01:15:57.527 --> 01:15:59.009]  We got a bunch of crazies running around.
[01:15:59.409 --> 01:16:00.491]  There's literally crazies!
[01:16:02.751 --> 01:16:12.214]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:17.456]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:16:18.096 --> 01:16:29.440]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[01:16:30.342 --> 01:16:43.730]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new, top-of-the-line, affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:49.693]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:16:50.154 --> 01:16:51.595]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[01:16:52.455 --> 01:16:53.295]  A lot of protein.
[01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:55.176]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[01:16:55.216 --> 01:16:55.857]  There's buildup.
[01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:59.558]  You can even rot inside your guts causing diverticulitis.
[01:16:59.718 --> 01:17:00.238]  You name it.
[01:17:00.819 --> 01:17:03.180]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[01:17:04.264 --> 01:17:11.749]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[01:17:12.269 --> 01:17:24.237]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.099]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[01:17:27.719 --> 01:17:31.703]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:33.965]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[01:17:34.406 --> 01:17:48.259]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Carnivorbe, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[01:17:48.479 --> 01:17:52.283]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[01:17:52.623 --> 01:17:54.705]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[01:17:55.065 --> 01:17:59.888]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:03.091]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:05.312]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:16.120]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:19.443]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[01:18:20.558 --> 01:18:33.366]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[01:18:33.947 --> 01:18:43.153]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[01:18:44.679 --> 01:18:46.401]  This is the total win-win.
[01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:52.629]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:57.615]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[01:18:57.936 --> 01:19:02.001]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[01:19:02.461 --> 01:19:03.442]  At the lowest price.
[01:19:03.923 --> 01:19:13.354]  Many probiotics out there don't even have capillates that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[01:19:13.935 --> 01:19:20.722]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:29.148]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[01:19:29.509 --> 01:19:35.193]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[01:19:35.673 --> 01:19:40.336]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[01:19:40.936 --> 01:19:49.963]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[01:19:51.061 --> 01:19:54.786]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[01:19:54.966 --> 01:20:02.816]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:20:06.421 --> 01:20:09.044]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:54.378 --> 01:20:55.738]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:58.219]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex today.
[01:20:58.239 --> 01:21:00.119]  We're going to be hearing from Alex in the next segment.
[01:21:01.019 --> 01:21:02.279]  Trump is speaking right now.
[01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:09.321]  He just delivered about a 20-minute speech and the crew is going through that, figuring out what exactly he was addressing.
[01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:20.863]  But the main subject would be the lawsuit that was just announced against California for aiding and abetting criminals in sanctuary cities.
[01:21:21.223 --> 01:21:21.723]  Of course, the
[01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:31.837]  name that we think about now is Libby Schaaf who in my opinion belongs in jail for aiding and abetting.
[01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:45.528]  It's so crazy you also got now in fact if somebody would actually bring me that story because this is actually important so they're they're trying to pass this legislation in Florida now some of the bullet points include
[01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:49.434]  Raising the age of purchasing.
[01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:53.636]  Is it just rifles or is it any firearms from the age of 18 to 21?
[01:21:54.816 --> 01:22:01.319]  You've also got the bump stop stock ban, which is actually worded anything that increases the rate of fire.
[01:22:01.599 --> 01:22:05.241]  So they'll come after triggers and scopes and handles and whatever else is next.
[01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:09.322]  They want to have a three-day waiting period.
[01:22:09.963 --> 01:22:11.783]  You know, here's my problem with a waiting period.
[01:22:12.084 --> 01:22:12.564]  I get it.
[01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:18.239]  But if somebody's getting a weapon to try to just do mass murder or whatever, they'll wait three days.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.941]  So I really only think, I don't think it serves any purpose.
[01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:27.062]  Because think about it, let's say you're in a situation where you feel maybe you need a gun tomorrow, and you can't get it.
[01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.563]  So now you're screwed.
[01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:31.964]  I don't like this.
[01:22:32.144 --> 01:22:32.704]  I don't like this.
[01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:34.125]  But here's what they're gonna do.
[01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:39.707]  They throw in the $400 million for mental health, and so you have to sign it.
[01:22:40.703 --> 01:22:42.084]  That's how they're going to sell this thing.
[01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:49.611]  Oh, if you don't sign this bill, you're stopping us from getting the necessary mental health measures here.
[01:22:51.653 --> 01:22:53.675]  So we'll look into some of these details.
[01:22:53.855 --> 01:22:56.857]  Again though, the story, NPR is covering it.
[01:22:56.897 --> 01:22:59.179]  Florida State approves gun control package.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.041]  Florida Senate approves gun control package.
[01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:02.963]  OK's arming some school personnel.
[01:23:03.223 --> 01:23:07.507]  So yeah, if you're on campus but not a full-time teacher, you can carry concealed.
[01:23:08.854 --> 01:23:20.964]  So there's your, okay, let's protect the students, and then the 400 million, all right, let's, you know, let's do something for mental health, and then they want to do metal detectors in schools, bulletproof glass in schools.
[01:23:22.245 --> 01:23:26.488]  And you know, again, they talk about, you know, having crisis teams and school resource officers.
[01:23:27.048 --> 01:23:30.211]  Folks, the authorities in Broward County, Coward County, failed those students.
[01:23:30.871 --> 01:23:31.452]  They failed.
[01:23:33.233 --> 01:23:34.915]  So how do you know the next people aren't going to fail?
[01:23:36.175 --> 01:23:37.557]  And they think that this is going to pass.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:44.643]  And I don't see anywhere in here that there are mental health facilities, including opening mental health institutions.
[01:23:44.723 --> 01:23:47.305]  I mean, you need to put people in mental health institutions, folks.
[01:23:47.325 --> 01:23:48.726]  They closed them back in the 90s.
[01:23:49.306 --> 01:23:50.327]  We need them more than ever.
[01:23:50.367 --> 01:23:50.847]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:51.507 --> 01:23:52.048]  We just do.
[01:23:54.989 --> 01:23:56.650]  So the waiting period is for any gun.
[01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:57.271]  Three days.
[01:23:59.332 --> 01:23:59.952]  Sorry, folks.
[01:23:59.992 --> 01:24:01.293]  This bill is no good to me.
[01:24:03.394 --> 01:24:03.614]  Nope.
[01:24:04.595 --> 01:24:06.036]  This bill sets a bad precedent.
[01:24:07.457 --> 01:24:07.997]  Can't support it.
[01:24:09.198 --> 01:24:11.879]  And again, this isn't the answer.
[01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:16.860]  This is not the answer to what happened at the Florida shooting.
[01:24:18.641 --> 01:24:19.601]  It's not even close.
[01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:22.142]  It's not even close.
[01:24:23.222 --> 01:24:27.823]  Because what happened was a failure of personnel.
[01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.684]  What happened was a failure at the FBI.
[01:24:31.064 --> 01:24:33.365]  What happened was a failure in local law enforcement.
[01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:37.846]  What happened was a failure during the shooting.
[01:24:40.225 --> 01:24:43.626]  So, this doesn't fix anything.
[01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:47.048]  But we have to do something.
[01:24:47.108 --> 01:24:47.828]  So that's what they do.
[01:24:47.888 --> 01:24:49.349]  So they have to do something.
[01:24:49.389 --> 01:24:50.950]  So then they just do something.
[01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:53.391]  Even if it doesn't actually do anything.
[01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:56.292]  It's really unbelievable.
[01:24:56.312 --> 01:24:56.812]  But you know what?
[01:25:00.754 --> 01:25:01.954]  You've got other big news here.
[01:25:02.094 --> 01:25:04.655]  I mean, this is so bombshell.
[01:25:05.776 --> 01:25:08.417]  Look at some of the precedents that are being set in Seattle today.
[01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:16.487]  This is from Zero Hedge.
[01:25:17.468 --> 01:25:20.249]  You see, this is all about what Eric Holder talks about.
[01:25:20.269 --> 01:25:21.870]  This is all about what the Democrats talk about.
[01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:24.511]  Brainwashing people into thinking differently about guns.
[01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:30.454]  Brainwashing people to literally shake in their boots when they just see a gun or the thought of a gun comes up.
[01:25:30.514 --> 01:25:33.295]  So, this individual
[01:25:34.926 --> 01:25:46.455]  People call authorities on him because he just happens to conceal carry or he's apparently looking out his window at some shop across the street or something and so authorities come and take his guns.
[01:25:50.038 --> 01:25:54.722]  Neighbors complained that the man had been staring at people through the storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm.
[01:25:55.142 --> 01:25:56.363]  So I don't know what that's all about.
[01:25:56.383 --> 01:25:57.284]  I mean, who knows?
[01:25:57.524 --> 01:26:01.147]  Maybe he's just standing out looking out his window drinking a cup of coffee.
[01:26:02.748 --> 01:26:04.190]  Just has his firearm on his side.
[01:26:05.438 --> 01:26:06.098]  You're a danger!
[01:26:06.519 --> 01:26:07.880]  We gotta take that firearm.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.824]  So who knows what the full story here is, but they confiscated his gun illegally!
[01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:15.985]  That's the story!
[01:26:16.005 --> 01:26:20.048]  I mean, so what's next?
[01:26:20.168 --> 01:26:28.473]  I'm telling you folks, they've already brainwashed these people into being so afraid of guns, if they see a gun, they go crazy and they call authorities.
[01:26:28.553 --> 01:26:29.894]  Just if they see a gun.
[01:26:30.595 --> 01:26:32.416]  Just if they see a gun!
[01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:35.731]  That's mental illness.
[01:26:37.372 --> 01:26:45.359]  That's the brainwashing that the Democrats have been trying to instill on this country, saying that you have to brainwash people into thinking differently about guns.
[01:26:45.779 --> 01:26:49.122]  You have to brainwash weak-minded people.
[01:26:49.142 --> 01:27:01.193]  You have to brainwash weak-minded people into being so afraid of guns, the mere sight of a gun sends them into some sort of shock.
[01:27:02.844 --> 01:27:04.225]  And they have to do something.
[01:27:04.945 --> 01:27:06.226]  Oh my gosh!
[01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:07.706]  That man has a gun!
[01:27:07.726 --> 01:27:09.447]  Oh my gosh!
[01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:11.288]  Somebody call the authorities!
[01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:13.729]  And that's how their mind works.
[01:27:13.749 --> 01:27:16.831]  And they freak out and they go into a panic just at the sight of a gun.
[01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:18.852]  That's the brainwashing by the media.
[01:27:19.152 --> 01:27:20.632]  That's the brainwashing by Hollywood.
[01:27:20.913 --> 01:27:25.755]  That's the brainwashing by the Democratic Party that Eric Holder told you they were going to do.
[01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:28.580]  And so now they've done it.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.241]  So then a mass shooting happens.
[01:27:31.122 --> 01:27:33.344]  They don't address any of the actual problems.
[01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:37.167]  They just sign gun control legislation because we have to do something.
[01:27:38.148 --> 01:27:40.329]  And in Seattle, oh my gosh!
[01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:41.831]  That man has a gun!
[01:27:42.451 --> 01:27:44.893]  And then the police come and say, sir, you've broken no laws.
[01:27:44.933 --> 01:27:46.294]  You haven't violated anything.
[01:27:46.915 --> 01:27:51.038]  We're taking your gun because this libtard over here just freaked out and called us.
[01:27:51.078 --> 01:27:53.020]  So we have to do something.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.821]  So we have to do something.
[01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:56.543]  So now he loses his gun.
[01:27:58.045 --> 01:28:00.307]  And so now Seattle has set that precedent.
[01:28:00.547 --> 01:28:07.212]  So now the next crazy liberal is gonna call the police on their neighbor that has a gun, and then they're gonna take that because the neighbor looked at them the wrong way.
[01:28:08.192 --> 01:28:08.773]  Oh my gosh!
[01:28:10.554 --> 01:28:12.696]  My neighbor came home drunk last night at 1 a.m.
[01:28:12.916 --> 01:28:14.037]  I know he's got a gun in there.
[01:28:14.257 --> 01:28:14.977]  I'm scared!
[01:28:15.338 --> 01:28:18.940]  And then they come up, Sir, we heard that you were drinking late last night and you have a gun in here.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.982]  He's like, well yeah, okay, I was out drinking.
[01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:22.222]  I didn't take my gun with me.
[01:28:22.262 --> 01:28:24.604]  It's locked in my... Sir, we're gonna have to confiscate that weapon.
[01:28:24.624 --> 01:28:25.305]  Your neighbor's scared.
[01:28:26.272 --> 01:28:29.777]  Then a Seattle judge, a homeless man in Seattle.
[01:28:29.797 --> 01:28:32.522]  Seattle's homeless problem is out of control, just like everywhere else on the West Coast.
[01:28:33.864 --> 01:28:35.546]  Homeless man's truck gets impounded.
[01:28:35.807 --> 01:28:36.828]  He can't afford to get it out.
[01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:41.974]  He sues, the judge says that's your home, your home can't be impounded.
[01:28:42.794 --> 01:28:47.057]  Now he gets his truck back and he can park his truck anywhere he wants because it can't get impounded.
[01:28:47.277 --> 01:28:49.418]  Do you realize the precedent just set in Seattle?
[01:28:49.638 --> 01:28:56.202]  So now homeless people are going to park their cars and trucks wherever they want and you can't do anything about it because they run the town.
[01:28:56.582 --> 01:29:00.345]  Non-citizens and homeless bums now run Seattle.
[01:29:02.819 --> 01:29:04.200]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.761]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.961 --> 01:29:06.862]  But where do you get it?
[01:29:07.162 --> 01:29:12.927]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:18.871]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:29:19.071 --> 01:29:35.926]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:29:36.326 --> 01:29:38.447]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:29:38.808 --> 01:29:40.008]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:29:40.288 --> 01:29:41.049]  Easy assembly.
[01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:41.949]  Low maintenance.
[01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.051]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:30:03.942 --> 01:30:10.667]  Dr. Mark Faber is an amazing individual, a lot of great economic predictions and laurels under his belt.
[01:30:11.087 --> 01:30:14.910]  He's Mark Faber, editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom and Doom Report.
[01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:19.734]  I could ask a lot of questions, but I want him to cover the waterfront from the Gloom, Boom, Doom Report.
[01:30:20.094 --> 01:30:21.835]  Thank you so much for joining us, doctor.
[01:30:21.915 --> 01:30:23.156]  Well, my pleasure, Alex.
[01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:24.437]  What should we tackle first?
[01:30:24.537 --> 01:30:25.538]  So much is going on.
[01:30:25.698 --> 01:30:31.983]  Yes, well, we can talk about the global economy, which is kind of strengthening somewhat.
[01:30:32.763 --> 01:30:40.150]  But as you know, a lot of this strength is due to government deficits and to money printing.
[01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:49.178]  In other words, the expansion of balance sheets of central banks and of course of credit growth, which is very strong.
[01:30:50.059 --> 01:30:53.742]  So it's kind of a mixed recovery.
[01:30:54.722 --> 01:30:56.844]  It's been very good for assets.
[01:30:57.504 --> 01:31:05.970]  Asset prices since 2009 have not only recovered, but they've gone and made new highs.
[01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:10.973]  Funds, stocks, dollar was strong until a year ago.
[01:31:12.334 --> 01:31:16.617]  Commodities have also done quite well over the last 12 months.
[01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:23.596]  So real estate has equally gone up around the world.
[01:31:24.317 --> 01:31:32.483]  We had a really an exceptional kind of a asset recovery asset bubble, I would say.
[01:31:33.584 --> 01:31:41.370]  And that has led to a stronger economic growth that looks reasonably good on the surface.
[01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:42.971]  But if you dig deeper,
[01:31:44.003 --> 01:31:47.025]  It's, of course, unstable economic growth.
[01:31:47.185 --> 01:32:01.411]  If you look at the last 20-30 years, wealthy people, in other words, the asset holders, have become immensely rich as a result of money printing and credit growth.
[01:32:02.332 --> 01:32:11.456]  And the average household, the typical household in the US, the typical household in Western countries in Europe,
[01:32:12.131 --> 01:32:16.418]  has had a essentially a declining standard of living.
[01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:29.412]  I would actually say that most boomers, people like myself, born just after the war, their children will die poorer than we will die, and they will earn less money.
[01:32:29.452 --> 01:32:34.834]  And this is statistically proven that in real terms, inflation adjusted, they earn less.
[01:32:35.014 --> 01:32:38.415]  There's nothing you can do against this relative decline.
[01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:40.476]  You can try to age well.
[01:32:40.736 --> 01:32:42.837]  I'm in a relative decline.
[01:32:43.017 --> 01:32:45.518]  I'm not as strong as I was when I was 20 years old.
[01:32:47.683 --> 01:32:51.724]  I can't do sports as well as when I was 25 years old.
[01:32:52.705 --> 01:32:54.345]  So I'm in a relative decline.
[01:32:54.805 --> 01:32:58.867]  But I can try to age well as you as well as you.
[01:32:59.367 --> 01:33:00.927]  So we have to try to do that.
[01:33:06.429 --> 01:33:09.110]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.424 --> 01:33:32.757]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:50.010]  Alex Jones here with an update for the viewers and listeners asking where I am during these huge political firestorms that are taking place and all the demonization of InfoWars.
[01:33:50.550 --> 01:34:07.845]  Well, I haven't taken off in about a year to take my family anywhere, so I'm enjoying some of the great freedoms of capitalism and all the incredible things it builds, like here in the mountains of Vail in Colorado, so we can come out here and snowboard and ski and watch the World Championship snowboarders and also ride the
[01:34:08.966 --> 01:34:09.947]  Tubes down the mountain.
[01:34:10.347 --> 01:34:12.008]  We're having a great family time out here.
[01:34:13.269 --> 01:34:16.911]  And yes, we've had this frivolous lawsuit filed by Pepe the Frog creator.
[01:34:17.371 --> 01:34:18.372]  We've talked to our lawyers.
[01:34:18.432 --> 01:34:20.653]  They say 100% slap statutes are in.
[01:34:20.973 --> 01:34:21.914]  It's a fake lawsuit.
[01:34:21.954 --> 01:34:23.454]  You didn't even create the buster.
[01:34:23.675 --> 01:34:24.795]  We're third-party selling it.
[01:34:25.155 --> 01:34:26.616]  We can't believe that they're this reckless.
[01:34:27.197 --> 01:34:28.958]  It's like the EEOC false filings.
[01:34:28.978 --> 01:34:30.058]  Those are totally reckless.
[01:34:31.479 --> 01:34:33.800]  All of it's just completely insane and totally reckless.
[01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:36.162]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have been
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:47.087]  Attacked for the term real news and have court cases against us the people saying that's trademarked It is amazing what's going on and what's unfolding?
[01:34:47.908 --> 01:35:02.661]  And we've gotten to the point with this pet me the frog situation And with all the other behavior that's going on where we're going to have to counter sue Very aggressively and of course give attorneys fees and damages so that people know that hey we've been nice this long but that
[01:35:03.582 --> 01:35:07.883]  Has an end because the left everywhere is saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:35:07.943 --> 01:35:09.883]  They are trying to shut down free speech.
[01:35:09.983 --> 01:35:12.404]  They are trying to shut down our channel.
[01:35:12.764 --> 01:35:16.525]  CNN is involved trying to get rid of our sponsors and have us banned off YouTube.
[01:35:16.885 --> 01:35:21.886]  So as you look out here, this amazing vista and we see what we built in America.
[01:35:22.306 --> 01:35:28.287]  They have mountains like this in North Korea, but there's nothing there because the people can't build anything.
[01:35:28.307 --> 01:35:29.948]  Look at these cool snowplows going by.
[01:35:29.988 --> 01:35:31.848]  Look at that great technology.
[01:35:32.762 --> 01:35:36.825]  They can't even produce cars in North Korea or Venezuela.
[01:35:38.606 --> 01:35:39.847]  And the people are starving to death.
[01:35:41.088 --> 01:35:47.892]  So this is real authoritarianism that's coming after us and we're going to have to fight back because you've been standing behind us.
[01:35:47.912 --> 01:35:49.513]  We're going to be able to defeat it.
[01:35:50.334 --> 01:35:53.056]  But it shows you where the globalists want to take us.
[01:35:53.696 --> 01:35:56.218]  It shows you what they want to do to us.
[01:35:57.058 --> 01:36:13.860]  If they're successful in how they have our children captive in the public schools, how Hollywood is trying to bully everybody into submission, but the good news is whether it's the NFL or whether it's Hollywood or whether it's the Oscars or any of this, they're all in free fall because the people aren't under their cultural control anymore.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.041]  And I, quite frankly,
[01:36:15.842 --> 01:36:34.787]  I am honored in this culture war as a libertarian just trying to promote real, open, free societies that a criminal like George Soros, a Nazi collaborator, and CNN and Media Matters and MSNBC and all these other groups are piling on and finding useful idiots to help them attack me because we're fighting in the 21st century for the real restoration of this republic.
[01:36:35.507 --> 01:36:39.689]  And usually people have to fight and physically die to restore a country to freedom or to get freedom.
[01:36:39.989 --> 01:36:44.350]  And so I'm just having to be demonized and attacked and lied about and sued
[01:36:46.530 --> 01:36:49.913]  Because they're trying to intimidate everybody else.
[01:36:49.933 --> 01:36:50.674]  This isn't about me.
[01:36:51.034 --> 01:36:53.096]  There's massive Internet censorship expanding.
[01:36:53.697 --> 01:36:55.258]  Apple's allying with Communist China.
[01:36:55.758 --> 01:36:59.762]  There's draconian attacks on free speech going on everywhere across the Western world.
[01:37:00.242 --> 01:37:07.869]  And so they think by picking me out, they can make you think, hey, if you're a populist, if you're a nationalist, if you're a conservative, if you're a constitutionalist, if you're a free market guy,
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:09.451]  You're going to be destroyed.
[01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:20.477]  The truth is capitalism built all of the technology and all of the theme parks and all the malls and all the medicine and all the science and the literature and the art.
[01:37:21.058 --> 01:37:25.981]  Nothing comes out of these communist regimes but hell and oppression because it's oppressors that run it and control it.
[01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:29.343]  They're systems of conquest, not systems of liberation and freedom.
[01:37:29.923 --> 01:37:30.864]  And that's just a fact.
[01:37:30.904 --> 01:37:32.785]  And so history is on my side.
[01:37:32.825 --> 01:37:33.586]  And so we will win.
[01:37:34.426 --> 01:37:39.651]  But they have gone from a lawsuit a month to a lawsuit a week now because they're getting pissed because they're all getting thrown out of court.
[01:37:39.972 --> 01:37:48.660]  The Communist Party USA is suing me, saying I attacked some guy or had people attack him at the RNC and no such thing as the truth.
[01:37:50.242 --> 01:37:50.983]  It's just crazy.
[01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:52.344]  Everybody knows I'm free speech.
[01:37:52.364 --> 01:37:54.086]  I don't agree with burning the flag, but you're right to do it.
[01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:58.309]  I'm in good company in all this.
[01:37:58.529 --> 01:38:02.773]  People need to understand, need to know, that family does come first at the end of the day.
[01:38:03.814 --> 01:38:14.903]  And I've been following some reports from the road here, but not as many, just because I'm confident we're going to win because you're strong and you understand these attacks on free speech are attacks on you.
[01:38:15.243 --> 01:38:17.465]  They're attacks on your speech to shut down these platforms.
[01:38:18.806 --> 01:38:24.309]  When they filed four strikes on us last week to shut our YouTube down, and YouTube didn't shut us down, they said they were fake strikes.
[01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:28.832]  The Washington Post came out and said, along with BuzzFeed, that we made it up.
[01:38:30.053 --> 01:38:32.634]  You saw the thousands of channels deleted or blocked or frozen.
[01:38:33.435 --> 01:38:34.576]  You saw them freeze our channel.
[01:38:34.756 --> 01:38:35.936]  You saw us show you the strikes.
[01:38:36.517 --> 01:38:38.978]  But again, that's how dumb they think you are.
[01:38:38.998 --> 01:38:40.039]  Like, you have no memory.
[01:38:40.339 --> 01:38:48.124]  You've seen CNN going after our sponsors, and CNN trying to get us banned, and CNN trying to block the publishing of my book, The War for the Future, with Neil Strauss.
[01:38:49.451 --> 01:38:56.797]  I mean, this is... If I heard something about this in another country on NPR, about this much censorship against one person, I wouldn't believe it.
[01:38:57.397 --> 01:39:04.663]  But again, they attack, and then they make a joke out of their attacks on free speech, that are the most epic and most draconian I've ever seen.
[01:39:05.283 --> 01:39:07.225]  I mean, this is concerted fraud.
[01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:11.447]  And so get ready for the offensive, because our listeners have been supporting us.
[01:39:11.667 --> 01:39:12.568]  They've been spreading the word.
[01:39:12.588 --> 01:39:14.449]  We're getting record traffic at Infowars.com.
[01:39:14.869 --> 01:39:15.829]  You've been buying the products.
[01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:17.250]  Got huge sales going right now.
[01:39:18.111 --> 01:39:24.154]  And I just hope all these lawsuits doesn't affect our expansion on the TV and so many other places we're reaching so many people.
[01:39:24.434 --> 01:39:31.498]  And right now we're neck and neck, but the donations and people buying products are coming in just enough to pay for the half million dollars I'm about to have to spend.
[01:39:31.518 --> 01:39:34.320]  A lot of these lawyers are pro bono, but I got to pay for the
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:42.828]  Lawsuits to be filed, the plane tickets, the hotels, the people that take the transcripts, the experts, all of it.
[01:39:43.249 --> 01:39:46.673]  So, we're lining up five lawsuits right now, about $100,000 apiece.
[01:39:47.554 --> 01:39:49.476]  Anti-slap backs, all of it for everybody.
[01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:51.858]  And so, that's it.
[01:39:52.038 --> 01:39:56.123]  And a lot of lawyers are in major law sites saying the same thing, going, God, these suits are fake!
[01:39:58.012 --> 01:40:03.175]  There's anti-slapsuit stuff, so these fake lawsuits, people pay for this, but they're being financed by big money.
[01:40:03.475 --> 01:40:04.516]  They don't even care.
[01:40:05.097 --> 01:40:10.040]  And that's the crazy part, is these are so reckless, it tells you the globalists are willing to do anything.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.381]  Hell, they're on CNN saying they're gonna kill the president.
[01:40:12.521 --> 01:40:14.983]  Anyway, check out that great, uh, snowplow.
[01:40:15.043 --> 01:40:17.384]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:27.291]  But what you know is,
[01:40:28.408 --> 01:40:32.114]  They're fighting to keep me from visiting Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:40:32.454 --> 01:40:37.081]  Everything wholesome, everything good, everything true, everything productive is under attack by the globalists.
[01:40:37.442 --> 01:40:39.325]  And the fact that I'm one of the people most attacked...
[01:40:40.623 --> 01:40:42.044]  But I still live in this great free country.
[01:40:42.284 --> 01:40:44.886]  And the memory of freedom we have is still holding them back.
[01:40:44.926 --> 01:40:47.188]  We're going to take that memory and plant that seed.
[01:40:47.488 --> 01:40:50.271]  And they thought they buried me, but they didn't know I was a seed.
[01:40:50.751 --> 01:40:51.351]  I forget who said that.
[01:40:51.371 --> 01:40:52.192]  They thought they buried me.
[01:40:52.432 --> 01:40:53.233]  They didn't know I was a seed.
[01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:54.514]  Thank you all.
[01:40:55.295 --> 01:40:57.997]  I'll be filing more live reports throughout the week and more tape reports.
[01:40:58.017 --> 01:41:01.599]  And I'll be back Saturday with the family back in the ATX.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:02.720]  But thank you all.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:03.901]  We're just all in this together.
[01:41:03.921 --> 01:41:05.422]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[01:41:05.442 --> 01:41:08.805]  And we'll defeat these people trying to destroy our free speech and trying to enslave our nation.
[01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:09.686]  God bless you all.
[01:41:12.535 --> 01:41:24.438]  And while Alex is out there in the snowy mountains of Colorado, I thought I would just mention that you've got Nor'easters brewing in New England, and they're about to have a second wave of them.
[01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:28.500]  You've also got huge snowstorms in the UK as well.
[01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:32.732]  Now you see why they quit crying global warming.
[01:41:34.213 --> 01:41:39.638]  Now you see why they quit saying man-made global warming and simply changed it to man-made climate change.
[01:41:39.678 --> 01:41:43.201]  Well, because they were wrong and their formulas were wrong about global warming.
[01:41:43.281 --> 01:41:50.408]  Sorry, they're wrong on global warming and climate change just like they're wrong on everything else and all their policies.
[01:41:50.888 --> 01:41:51.288]  But folks,

[01:42:09.922 --> 01:42:15.464]  But thanks to your support, we can take on these lawsuits and deal with this and still expand.

[01:44:19.072 --> 01:44:23.856]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[01:45:12.506 --> 01:45:13.527]  Tell us about that, Kit.
[01:45:13.727 --> 01:45:21.113]  Spike himself just sought to make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford.
[01:45:21.953 --> 01:45:26.617]  And that's why Pipe Hitters Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well.
[01:45:26.977 --> 01:45:28.739]  We wanted to put out a line of rifles.
[01:45:29.239 --> 01:45:37.026]  We wanted rifles that were high quality, that were combat rated, that we could like put our name on and really stand behind.
[01:45:37.166 --> 01:45:42.650]  So we looked around at quite a few companies and to be quite honest it was an easy decision to make.
[01:45:43.011 --> 01:45:45.353]  Spikes Tactical is a small family-owned
[01:45:46.053 --> 01:45:46.454]  Business.
[01:45:46.834 --> 01:45:48.115]  They stand behind their products.
[01:45:48.336 --> 01:45:50.918]  As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee.
[01:45:50.959 --> 01:45:54.402]  If you have a problem with your gun, they will fix the problem.
[01:45:54.482 --> 01:45:56.745]  And that is huge in today's age.
[01:45:57.045 --> 01:46:00.990]  So you've got a very high-end rifle at a very affordable price.
[01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:02.832]  We're also 100% American-made.
[01:46:05.194 --> 01:46:07.717]  They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[01:46:07.857 --> 01:46:10.140]  They are strong supporters of the military.
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.441]  Spike gives back a lot.
[01:46:11.501 --> 01:46:15.606]  Well, I know the listeners are big fans already of Spike Tactical and the fact you're supporting us.

[01:47:05.915 --> 01:47:08.576]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.383 --> 01:47:23.108]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.148 --> 01:47:25.129]  Now, you know that establishment media
[01:47:40.211 --> 01:47:45.612]  is failing right now if you focus mainly on the ratings.
[01:47:46.432 --> 01:47:51.593]  Movie attendance is down, Super Bowl, NFL ratings down, Oscar ratings, lows.
[01:47:52.573 --> 01:48:00.635]  Everything that the liberals have destroyed, everything that the liberals have conquered and then destroyed, the ratings are crashing.
[01:48:01.795 --> 01:48:03.755]  Late night television, you know, what have you.
[01:48:05.495 --> 01:48:07.636]  And Jimmy Kimmel
[01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:09.937]  The Walking Kanish.
[01:48:11.058 --> 01:48:14.543]  Jimmy Kimmel blames Netflix for record low Oscars ratings following Trump tweet.
[01:48:14.583 --> 01:48:24.016]  Now, I'll get into that theory in a second, but first let's actually go to Jimmy Kimmel here responding to Trump's tweet about the record low rating Oscars.
[01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:26.344]  I got a little surprise this morning.
[01:48:26.624 --> 01:48:31.809]  I woke up, I brushed my teeth, I looked at my phone, I got a texting, look at Trump's Twitter account.
[01:48:32.049 --> 01:48:33.531]  As if I wasn't going to do that anyway.
[01:48:35.072 --> 01:48:36.654]  That is what I do every morning.
[01:48:36.714 --> 01:48:39.176]  And so, I did, and this is what I see.
[01:48:39.737 --> 01:48:41.638]  Lowest rated Oscars in history.
[01:48:41.738 --> 01:48:43.880]  Problem is, we don't have stars anymore.
[01:48:44.121 --> 01:48:45.101]  Except your president.
[01:48:45.322 --> 01:48:46.423]  Just kidding, of course.
[01:48:48.336 --> 01:48:49.257]  Of course he's kidding.
[01:48:49.697 --> 01:48:51.118]  He's not narcissistic.
[01:48:51.158 --> 01:48:51.839]  It's a joke.
[01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:53.340]  No, neither are you, Jimmy.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:59.004]  Trump loves saying the ratings are down to insinuate that is a show of some kind of support for him.
[01:48:59.324 --> 01:49:04.548]  But the truth is, every year since Netflix happened, ratings are down for every big TV show.
[01:49:04.588 --> 01:49:06.289]  Super Bowl, Grammys, Emmys, Golden Globe.
[01:49:06.449 --> 01:49:09.371]  But Trump thinks he caused the ratings to go down.
[01:49:09.452 --> 01:49:13.655]  So, since I was the host of the Oscars, I felt like... That's not what he's saying, Jimmy.
[01:49:14.355 --> 01:49:20.577]  Well, except that's not true.
[01:49:20.597 --> 01:49:22.118]  Oh, but wait a second.
[01:49:23.118 --> 01:49:24.238]  But wait a second, that's not true.
[01:49:24.278 --> 01:49:28.500]  Trump's ratings are actually going up, and he's actually higher than Obama now.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:32.321]  So, oh, yeah, oh, buzzer right there.
[01:49:32.361 --> 01:49:34.021]  See, this is the funniest thing about these people.
[01:49:34.561 --> 01:49:35.742]  Jimmy Kimmel just says
[01:49:37.009 --> 01:49:47.693]  It's like when President Obama says, at least I'll be president, and Trump is the president, Obama thinks he gets some big insult, at least I'll be the president, and then the crowd's like, oh!
[01:49:48.153 --> 01:49:49.413]  He got him there, woo!
[01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:58.557]  And then Trump becomes president, and then Jimmy Kimmel goes, oh, really funny, lowest rated president of all time, oh!
[01:49:59.057 --> 01:50:03.258]  Except he's not the lowest rated president of all time.
[01:50:03.799 --> 01:50:04.599]  In fact, you know,
[01:50:05.259 --> 01:50:09.123]  You had stories today, support rising for the GOP tax overhaul.
[01:50:09.804 --> 01:50:10.845]  That's bipartisan.
[01:50:11.206 --> 01:50:17.994]  President Trump's approval rating is right on par, if not ahead, of Obama's at this point of his first term.
[01:50:18.915 --> 01:50:19.716]  So sorry, Jimmy.
[01:50:19.776 --> 01:50:22.459]  Not only are you not funny, you're also inaccurate.
[01:50:22.759 --> 01:50:23.480]  Let's go back to Kimmel.
[01:50:25.599 --> 01:50:32.486]  Trump always has a problem with the Academy Awards, which is surprising because I really think he would love the Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water.
[01:50:32.787 --> 01:50:37.332]  The movie, if you haven't seen it, it's about a monster that has sex with a woman who can't talk about it.
[01:50:37.612 --> 01:50:38.153]  Basically...
[01:50:40.276 --> 01:50:43.100]  It's like his life story, right?
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:46.645]  As everyone's making up stories about Trump like they can't talk about it.
[01:50:47.385 --> 01:50:48.847]  That's all the media ever talks about!
[01:50:48.887 --> 01:50:50.029]  You talk about it every night!
[01:50:57.739 --> 01:51:05.722]  He retweeted this, raise your hand if you didn't watch the second of the Oscars, and then he added an emoji of a raised hand to indicate that he didn't watch.
[01:51:05.782 --> 01:51:10.963]  And you know, if you look closely, you know that's an authentic Trump hand because it's gold and tiny.
[01:51:15.605 --> 01:51:16.425]  Nice laugh track.
[01:51:16.465 --> 01:51:18.806]  Now here's the thing about what Kimmel is insinuating.
[01:51:19.846 --> 01:51:21.427]  There is an element of truth, yes.
[01:51:22.392 --> 01:51:23.793]  Why are TV ratings down?
[01:51:24.273 --> 01:51:25.994]  Why is attendance at movies down?
[01:51:26.454 --> 01:51:33.679]  Yes, a lot of that does have to do with the new media being on the internet, the Netflix's, the Hulu's, and everything like that.
[01:51:33.699 --> 01:51:35.180]  I mean, even the InfoWars.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.022]  I mean, why do you think that, you know, CNN's ratings are tanking like the Titanic?
[01:51:40.062 --> 01:51:41.743]  Well, people would rather watch InfoWars.
[01:51:41.823 --> 01:51:43.384]  Our ratings go up, their ratings go down.
[01:51:43.424 --> 01:51:45.005]  I mean, that's how this works.
[01:51:46.967 --> 01:51:47.367]  But there's a...
[01:51:49.372 --> 01:51:58.701]  Not a silver lining here, it's a, it's a, it's a, I would say a grey lining here because here, here's another angle to this that Kimmel's not going to tell you.
[01:52:00.983 --> 01:52:05.087]  Yes, does some of it have to do with new media and Netflix and everything, sure.
[01:52:05.688 --> 01:52:08.751]  But that doesn't necessarily explain why NFL ratings are down.
[01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:11.954]  That doesn't necessarily explain why the Oscar ratings are down.
[01:52:11.994 --> 01:52:12.495]  You can't really
[01:52:13.803 --> 01:52:20.425]  Go elsewhere to watch those programs where, with movie theaters, you can say, yeah, okay, maybe people would rather stay at home and watch Netflix.
[01:52:21.125 --> 01:52:22.845]  But why would people stop watching the Oscars?
[01:52:22.865 --> 01:52:27.606]  Why would people stop watching the NFL, usually the highest rated events on any given time?
[01:52:28.466 --> 01:52:36.968]  Well, that's because you, Jimmy Kimmel, and the rest of your liberal friends in Hollywood have destroyed people's interest.
[01:52:38.009 --> 01:52:38.909]  And that's the truth.
[01:52:40.273 --> 01:52:50.438]  So while you can maybe say that the reason movie attendance is down is because of Netflix, people don't watch the grand Hollywood celebrations because we're sick of you!
[01:52:51.679 --> 01:52:53.640]  Because we're sick of your liberal indoctrination!
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:54.740]  We're sick of your nonsense!
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.721]  We're sick of your lies!
[01:52:56.001 --> 01:52:57.461]  We're sick of your attacks on our president!
[01:52:57.621 --> 01:52:59.242]  We're sick of your attacks on our country!
[01:53:00.543 --> 01:53:02.964]  We're sick of your assault on reality and truth!
[01:53:05.165 --> 01:53:06.466]  But there's another angle to this too!
[01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:13.979]  See, Trump is actually right when he says, problem is we don't have any stars anymore.
[01:53:14.259 --> 01:53:15.400]  He's 100% right!
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:17.801]  He is 100% accurate.
[01:53:18.402 --> 01:53:33.532]  You see, going to the theater, the only movies that actually really sell anymore are either the movies that already have tradition, like Star Wars or something like that, or some movie that gets huge amounts of hype, like The Black Panther.
[01:53:35.193 --> 01:53:35.854]  It used to be
[01:53:37.122 --> 01:53:45.309]  Someone like Jennifer Lawrence would be considered a movie star and then people would go watch her movies no matter what because they loved her work.
[01:53:45.689 --> 01:53:50.973]  But she's poisoned her audience with her liberalism and so there's not that interest anymore.
[01:53:51.353 --> 01:53:55.417]  Nobody wants to go see Jennifer Lawrence anymore because they can't stand her.
[01:53:56.818 --> 01:53:58.339]  That's the angle they're not going to tell you.
[01:53:58.619 --> 01:54:00.501]  See, nobody wants to go watch
[01:54:02.008 --> 01:54:06.852]  Jennifer Lawrence on a big screen anymore because all they can think about is that dumbass liberal.
[01:54:07.432 --> 01:54:09.254]  Nobody can watch the NFL.
[01:54:09.334 --> 01:54:10.054]  I shouldn't say nobody.
[01:54:10.235 --> 01:54:15.579]  A lot of people can't watch the NFL anymore because they can't get that image of the players kneeling out of their head.
[01:54:15.819 --> 01:54:21.684]  So they watch the game and the whole thing is spoiled because all they can think about is the people protesting the National Anthem.
[01:54:22.384 --> 01:54:28.369]  So they've poisoned their own brand, they've poisoned their own product, that's why movie theater attendance is down.
[01:54:28.469 --> 01:54:29.910]  Does Netflix have something to do with it?
[01:54:30.311 --> 01:54:32.532]  Yes, but do not be mistaken.
[01:54:33.593 --> 01:54:39.398]  People are sick of liberals in Hollywood telling us how to feel and telling us how to think.
[01:54:39.918 --> 01:54:44.122]  That is why people don't go to the movies anymore, because they don't want to see people like Jennifer Lawrence.
[01:54:44.422 --> 01:54:48.886]  Now, you've got a student
[01:54:51.036 --> 01:54:58.662]  Anthony Borges, 15, is suing the Broward County Sheriff's Office, the school district, and the principal and resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
[01:54:58.703 --> 01:55:02.426]  He was shot five times, using his body to shield others while they were fleeing.
[01:55:02.846 --> 01:55:07.390]  This young man is a hero, and he's suing the people that actually failed.
[01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:11.513]  That's right, the Broward County Sheriff, the school district, and the resource officer, etc.
[01:55:12.454 --> 01:55:13.595]  FBI should be in there too.
[01:55:14.175 --> 01:55:16.838]  But you notice, he's not suing the gun.
[01:55:18.271 --> 01:55:20.571]  He's not suing the gun manufacturer.
[01:55:21.572 --> 01:55:21.812]  Huh.
[01:55:21.872 --> 01:55:23.192]  He's not suing the NRA.
[01:55:24.312 --> 01:55:25.612]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:34.894]  Funny how liberals point the finger in all the wrong directions, and then the actual hero victim is going after the actual people responsible for this.
[01:55:35.354 --> 01:55:42.876]  Then, on Fox News last night, Kyle Kashuv, who they used to ignore, is calling out David Hogg for being hypocritical.
[01:55:43.296 --> 01:55:44.996]  Here's that clip from Fox News.
[01:55:46.167 --> 01:55:48.690]  I want to play David Hogg, who has been out there a lot.
[01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:51.673]  He's become very familiar to Americans.
[01:55:51.993 --> 01:55:54.876]  Here he is speaking out on his side.
[01:55:54.936 --> 01:55:55.257]  Watch this.
[01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:58.487]  I actually hung up on the White House the other day.
[01:55:58.747 --> 01:56:03.068]  They actually called me the day before the listening session and asked if we were going to come.
[01:56:03.108 --> 01:56:07.009]  And I said, I'm not coming because we expect President Trump to come to the CNN town hall.
[01:56:07.369 --> 01:56:08.930]  And I ended on this message with them.
[01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:11.970]  I said, President Trump, we don't need to listen to President Trump.
[01:56:12.230 --> 01:56:15.931]  President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation.
[01:56:16.331 --> 01:56:17.932]  Now pause it right there, pause it right there real quick.
[01:56:18.752 --> 01:56:20.732]  Now this is something very important to understand.
[01:56:21.533 --> 01:56:22.893]  This is liberal arrogance.
[01:56:24.215 --> 01:56:30.798]  So now, unfortunately for David Hogg, he's been so indoctrinated by the liberals, he now has this sick, poisoned liberal arrogance.
[01:56:32.399 --> 01:56:33.339]  I'm high and mighty.
[01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:34.640]  I'm bigger than President Trump.
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.320]  I'm bigger than you.
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.080]  I'm bigger than everyone.
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:36.981]  I'm a liberal.
[01:56:37.541 --> 01:56:38.521]  I've got the high ground.
[01:56:38.601 --> 01:56:39.762]  I've got the moral high ground.
[01:56:39.822 --> 01:56:41.262]  I'm calling for taking the guns.
[01:56:41.723 --> 01:56:43.704]  You support the Second Amendment, you're the bad guy.
[01:56:43.964 --> 01:56:44.584]  I'm the good guy.
[01:56:44.604 --> 01:56:45.184]  I'm David Hogg.
[01:56:45.364 --> 01:56:46.385]  I'm bigger than the President.
[01:56:47.025 --> 01:56:47.725]  Yep, that's right.
[01:56:48.706 --> 01:56:51.207]  Oh yeah, go back to Fox News now.
[01:56:53.086 --> 01:56:55.668]  You know, I'm really trying to control my anger at what he said.
[01:56:56.848 --> 01:57:10.397]  Because, you know, the president calls you and it shows he wants to make a change, and you're talking about a pro-partisan change, and the one man who controls, who leads our nation, you know, comes to you and is like, look, let's do something, let's make it happen, and you hang up the phone on him?
[01:57:10.417 --> 01:57:11.758]  That's so hypocritical.
[01:57:12.118 --> 01:57:14.680]  You know, he was, David Hogg was like, we have to make a change.
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.041]  But again, you can bring that down, but again,
[01:57:17.201 --> 01:57:19.103]  See, look, I feel bad for David Hogg now.
[01:57:19.163 --> 01:57:23.927]  He is totally exuding all liberalism, all lib-tardation.
[01:57:24.828 --> 01:57:28.251]  The arrogance, the high and mighty moral high ground arrogance.
[01:57:28.712 --> 01:57:29.893]  And then the double standard!
[01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:32.229]  And then the double standard.
[01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:39.692]  Just as Kyle points out, here's President Trump calling you to have the conversation you said you wanted to have and you ignore it like you're bigger than it.
[01:57:40.092 --> 01:57:42.013]  You don't actually want to solve the problem.
[01:57:42.033 --> 01:57:44.354]  See, again, that's a liberal in a nutshell.
[01:57:44.754 --> 01:57:48.956]  Doesn't actually want to solve the problem and arrogantly thinks they have all the answers.
[01:57:49.276 --> 01:57:51.497]  That is the average liberal in a nutshell.
[01:57:52.594 --> 01:58:04.121]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:58:04.161 --> 01:58:05.121]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:58:05.161 --> 01:58:06.182]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:58:06.222 --> 01:58:11.205]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:58:11.585 --> 01:58:16.608]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:58:16.708 --> 01:58:18.809]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:21.010]  Well, causes you to gain weight.
[01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:24.753]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:58:24.853 --> 01:58:29.856]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:58:30.216 --> 01:58:35.680]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:41.284]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:58:41.644 --> 01:58:42.585]  And over and over again.
[01:58:42.665 --> 01:58:49.548]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:58:49.748 --> 01:58:51.970]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:53.610]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:58:53.690 --> 01:59:06.938]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:59:06.958 --> 01:59:07.658]  Fertility is key.
[01:59:08.218 --> 01:59:18.382]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually.
[01:59:18.422 --> 01:59:24.805]  The whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:59:25.185 --> 01:59:29.207]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:59:29.247 --> 01:59:32.788]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[01:59:33.268 --> 01:59:34.629]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:38.170]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:11.989 --> 02:00:14.751]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:20.114]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:00:20.414 --> 02:00:25.758]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.778 --> 02:00:28.099]  Well, you had
[02:00:41.724 --> 02:00:51.631]  Jeff Sessions wake up from a coma and address the illegality and the issue with sanctuary cities.
[02:00:53.052 --> 02:00:57.295]  Then you had Trump also echo that in statements that he made.
[02:00:58.175 --> 02:01:09.183]  But now, Jerry Brown, the governor of California, is fighting back against this, saying it's an act of war.
[02:01:09.883 --> 02:01:10.844]  Well now wait a second!
[02:01:12.449 --> 02:01:24.326]  I tell ya, this is so 1984, it's like, I just have to, just like... If you're at war, okay... If you're at war, what is one of the things that happens?
[02:01:24.346 --> 02:01:25.007]  You get invaded!
[02:01:25.147 --> 02:01:27.490]  You get invaded by... by foreigners!
[02:01:29.977 --> 02:01:33.300]  That's what's happening in California, and Jerry Brown is endorsing it.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:42.188]  So here's Jerry Brown actually endorsing what would be considered an act of war, an invasion of foreign people, and then destroying his state.
[02:01:42.288 --> 02:01:56.121]  I mean, the state of California has so much debt, feces on the streets, needles on the streets, drug epidemics, homeless epidemics, totally out of control, totally invaded by foreigners, an act of war on California,
[02:01:57.182 --> 02:02:01.165]  And then here comes the federal government like, California, you're out of control.
[02:02:01.705 --> 02:02:03.026]  You're lawless.
[02:02:03.347 --> 02:02:04.608]  We have to do something about it.
[02:02:04.828 --> 02:02:06.989]  And then Jerry Brown says that's an act of war.
[02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:08.811]  Let's go to this clip from Jerry Brown.
[02:02:09.792 --> 02:02:12.013]  You called this an act of war from the federal government.
[02:02:12.033 --> 02:02:12.754]  An act of war?
[02:02:14.015 --> 02:02:14.675]  You said that.
[02:02:16.236 --> 02:02:17.197]  That's pretty strong.
[02:02:18.758 --> 02:02:19.519]  Oh, it's all a joke.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:21.080]  It's all a joke.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.041]  We're just breaking the law.
[02:02:23.110 --> 02:02:27.053]  Are you going to retaliate to what the federal government has done?
[02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:28.374]  No, we are a state of laws.
[02:02:29.015 --> 02:02:29.475]  No, you're not.
[02:02:29.495 --> 02:02:31.617]  I want to observe the law.
[02:02:32.237 --> 02:02:33.258]  You ignore the law!
[02:02:34.319 --> 02:02:35.179]  Can you believe this?
[02:02:35.199 --> 02:02:40.023]  It's basically thrown the gauntlet down and done it in a highly politicized way.
[02:02:41.064 --> 02:02:42.165]  This has never happened before.
[02:02:42.205 --> 02:02:44.867]  Jerry, you have destroyed the state of California!
[02:02:46.553 --> 02:02:48.053]  So the Attorney General's coming out here.
[02:02:48.073 --> 02:02:49.154]  He gives a speech.
[02:02:49.394 --> 02:02:50.914]  You are a rat!
[02:02:50.934 --> 02:02:52.035]  You rat!
[02:02:52.055 --> 02:02:52.715]  To Washington.
[02:02:53.535 --> 02:02:54.255]  What does that do?
[02:02:54.355 --> 02:02:59.197]  I mean, that's not creating the comity that a state and the federal government need.
[02:02:59.317 --> 02:03:05.279]  So, yeah, this is a very aggressive act on the part of the Trump administration.
[02:03:05.779 --> 02:03:06.959]  And it's not right.
[02:03:07.019 --> 02:03:08.200]  You are such a traitor.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:14.662]  As I say, I'm sure this lawsuit has more longevity than the Trump administration itself.
[02:03:17.085 --> 02:03:26.849]  Okay, so Jerry Brown has destroyed California, destroyed, I mean, I'm struggling to even wrap my mind around this.
[02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:44.277]  California, riddled with homelessness, riddled with disease, wide open borders, ridden with all illegal citizens, sanctuary cities, feces in the streets, needles in the streets, homeless epidemic, disease, I mean, just total destruction.
[02:03:44.297 --> 02:03:46.358]  I mean, California is just a nightmare!
[02:03:47.901 --> 02:03:49.102]  A liberal utopia.
[02:03:49.903 --> 02:03:50.944]  A total nightmare.
[02:03:51.104 --> 02:03:58.570]  So here comes Trump and the DOJ and say, look, you gotta have a border, okay?
[02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:02.954]  And then you cannot aid and abet criminals that are here illegally.
[02:04:05.236 --> 02:04:13.303]  You know, you have Kate Steinle get murdered and the illegal non-citizen immigrant gets away with that.
[02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:15.349]  You got feces in the streets.
[02:04:15.429 --> 02:04:17.090]  It's just total madness.
[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:19.610]  Literally, California just collapsing.
[02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:21.030]  Falling apart.
[02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:23.851]  Half of the state wants to get out.
[02:04:24.491 --> 02:04:26.651]  The other half of the state wants to form a new California.
[02:04:27.031 --> 02:04:28.912]  And so the federal government's trying to get it under control.
[02:04:28.952 --> 02:04:30.232]  Like, okay, just have a border.
[02:04:30.652 --> 02:04:32.012]  Stop protecting illegals.
[02:04:32.472 --> 02:04:33.752]  Stop protecting criminals.
[02:04:33.852 --> 02:04:36.233]  Just, you know, get yourselves under control.
[02:04:36.773 --> 02:04:39.393]  And then here's Jerry Brown like, how dare they?
[02:04:40.134 --> 02:04:41.994]  I'm gonna destroy the state of California.
[02:04:42.714 --> 02:04:47.976]  If President Trump thinks he can stop me from destroying the state of California, he's wrong.
[02:04:48.456 --> 02:04:55.378]  If Jeff Sessions thinks he can stop Libby Schaaf from breaking the law and aiding and abetting criminals, they are wrong.
[02:04:55.898 --> 02:04:56.838]  I'm Jerry Brown.
[02:04:57.318 --> 02:05:01.219]  I'm going to destroy California and nobody's going to stop me!

[02:06:18.103 --> 02:06:21.085]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:27.802 --> 02:06:29.544]  Alright, so we just heard from Jerry Brown.
[02:06:30.564 --> 02:06:35.689]  He's going to continue to let California turn into a total sh-hole.
[02:06:36.269 --> 02:06:36.890]  And he's proud of it.
[02:06:38.091 --> 02:06:44.817]  He's going to continue to allow people like Libby Schaaf and the other authorities in California break the law and aid and abet criminals.
[02:06:45.257 --> 02:06:50.242]  And they're going to fight back against the federal government trying to get California out of, under control.
[02:06:50.362 --> 02:06:53.805]  A totally out of control, failed state turning into a third world nation.
[02:06:55.336 --> 02:07:05.152]  Folks, I've got friends in San Francisco, they work their tails off and they can barely even afford to live in a home that is one block outside of the feces zone!
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:15.964]  And I'm talking to them about it, and they're just like, you know, oh yeah, that's just how San Francisco is, you know, oh, yeah, I wish something would be done about it, but oh, you know, it's just what it is.
[02:07:16.004 --> 02:07:21.027]  Yeah, I walk outside and there's some, you know, some drug addict injecting heroin right there.
[02:07:21.067 --> 02:07:27.410]  It's clean needle, though, and then he walks down the street and takes a, you know what, and it's all good, baby, it's just California.
[02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:28.070]  Free love!
[02:07:28.130 --> 02:07:28.931]  Free love, baby!
[02:07:29.631 --> 02:07:30.752]  Yes, California.
[02:07:31.052 --> 02:07:31.873]  Wide open borders.
[02:07:32.093 --> 02:07:33.614]  Hey, come on into California.
[02:07:33.934 --> 02:07:35.175]  Yeah, shoot a citizen.
[02:07:35.215 --> 02:07:36.256]  Yeah, just shoot her dead.
[02:07:36.616 --> 02:07:37.477]  Oh, you'll walk free.
[02:07:37.517 --> 02:07:38.198]  Don't worry about that.
[02:07:38.238 --> 02:07:45.203]  The ACLU will make sure if you murder an American citizen and you're a non-citizen that you get off without going to jail or anything like that.
[02:07:45.223 --> 02:07:46.764]  I mean, this is free love here in California.
[02:07:46.784 --> 02:07:48.625]  If you're an American citizen, you're a piece of trash.
[02:07:48.986 --> 02:07:50.427]  If you're a non-citizen, you're a hero.
[02:07:50.587 --> 02:07:51.728]  And you can't do anything illegal.
[02:07:52.628 --> 02:07:59.774]  Unless you're Libby Schaaf, then, and you're supporting the invasion, then, and you're aiding and abetting criminals, then you're good to go.
[02:08:01.336 --> 02:08:13.687]  But there's a future to California that they either want or they don't understand, but it goes from one level, then it goes to the next level.
[02:08:17.304 --> 02:08:18.445]  You've already got Dreamers.
[02:08:18.705 --> 02:08:21.686]  They protest in front of Pelosi's house.
[02:08:21.706 --> 02:08:23.367]  They protest in front of Schumer's house.
[02:08:23.928 --> 02:08:25.709]  They protest in front of the DNC now.
[02:08:25.729 --> 02:08:27.970]  They say the Democrats don't want the Dreamers here.
[02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:30.871]  So Trump totally checkmated the Democrats on that.
[02:08:32.132 --> 02:08:44.579]  But the Democrats have enabled criminals, enabled lawbreakers so much to the point now where they go out in front of ICE headquarters.
[02:08:44.899 --> 02:08:46.160]  See, this is what happens when you have a
[02:08:47.353 --> 02:08:53.515]  Mayor that is colluding with criminals, aiding and abetting crime, saying that ICE is coming for you, make sure you hide.
[02:08:53.915 --> 02:08:54.656]  That's illegal.
[02:08:54.716 --> 02:08:55.676]  She belongs in jail.
[02:08:56.196 --> 02:09:02.138]  But now you have empowered these people, you've empowered lawbreakers to just flaunt it in front of authorities.
[02:09:02.418 --> 02:09:04.079]  So here's a video from New Jersey.
[02:09:05.239 --> 02:09:09.561]  Illegal citizens flaunting their unlawful status outside of ICE headquarters.
[02:09:19.152 --> 02:09:23.093]  Today, March 5th, is the day that Trump decided to wind down DACA.
[02:09:23.693 --> 02:09:26.994]  Obviously, the courts rolled in our favor and said that he can't do that.
[02:09:27.214 --> 02:09:28.534]  He tried to make a DACA deal.
[02:09:28.614 --> 02:09:30.535]  The Democrats refused it.
[02:09:30.575 --> 02:09:32.215]  Dreamers are being deported every single day.
[02:09:32.555 --> 02:09:34.996]  Our families, our communities are being torn apart every single day.
[02:09:35.316 --> 02:09:37.016]  March 5th is really the day that we're fighting back.
[02:09:37.696 --> 02:09:38.817]  See, that's not even true!
[02:09:42.277 --> 02:09:44.478]  For the whole wide world, this is Dreamers territory!
[02:09:45.128 --> 02:09:45.748]  Look at these people.
[02:09:45.808 --> 02:09:46.908]  These people are nuts, man.
[02:09:47.749 --> 02:09:51.269]  Why do you care about American people?
[02:09:51.289 --> 02:09:56.470]  You don't stand for American people.
[02:09:56.670 --> 02:09:57.191]  So see, that's it.
[02:09:57.251 --> 02:10:00.651]  Victory for them is destroying America.
[02:10:14.275 --> 02:10:24.279]  Victory for them is killing America, destroying the borders, and then again they say, Trump isn't doing anything to protect us, it's all Trump's fault.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:28.841]  Trump offered to give all you amnesty, and the Democrats turned it down!
[02:10:29.542 --> 02:10:37.085]  But you're so illiterate, and you're so brainwashed, you don't even see what's happening in front of your face.
[02:10:39.506 --> 02:10:39.786]  Now look,
[02:10:42.518 --> 02:10:47.762]  All of these people, if you're a DACA recipient, okay, whatever, you're being protected right now.
[02:10:48.982 --> 02:10:57.908]  But you've got non-citizens, this happens in Austin, Texas, illegal immigrants, they march in the street, they have confidence, they run this country now!
[02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:00.610]  You're an American?
[02:11:01.891 --> 02:11:05.193]  You've had multiple generations of people serving in the military?
[02:11:05.654 --> 02:11:07.155]  Multiple generations of American?
[02:11:07.755 --> 02:11:08.756]  You're a piece of trash!
[02:11:09.476 --> 02:11:10.117]  You're a scum!
[02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:12.910]  We don't give a hoot about you.
[02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:17.951]  We've got 20 million illegal citizens here.
[02:11:18.251 --> 02:11:19.512]  They run the country now.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:21.632]  That's why they march in the streets.
[02:11:21.852 --> 02:11:23.073]  That's why they go in front of ICE.
[02:11:23.293 --> 02:11:24.353]  That's why they brag about it.
[02:11:24.513 --> 02:11:26.194]  That's why Linda Sarsour brags about it.
[02:11:26.554 --> 02:11:27.854]  They run you now, buddy.
[02:11:28.154 --> 02:11:30.355]  This is the gangsterism of the left.
[02:11:31.395 --> 02:11:36.057]  MS-13, where MSNBC even admits to you they won't report on MS-13.
[02:11:37.409 --> 02:11:41.331]  If you watch MSNBC, you've never heard of MS-13, the violent gang.
[02:11:41.931 --> 02:11:44.892]  You only hear about that if you, you know, pay attention to conservative news.
[02:11:46.673 --> 02:11:47.714]  And then, and then you hear it.
[02:11:48.154 --> 02:11:49.394]  This is victory for us!
[02:11:49.775 --> 02:11:51.755]  We're gonna bring in all of the illegals!
[02:11:52.136 --> 02:11:53.776]  We're gonna shut down the border!
[02:11:53.996 --> 02:11:58.438]  We're gonna turn every state in the Union into California, a failed third world state!
[02:11:58.839 --> 02:12:00.039]  And that's victory!
[02:12:00.059 --> 02:12:01.440]  Ah ha ha ha ha!
[02:12:02.721 --> 02:12:04.241]  I'm Governor Jerry Brown.
[02:12:04.642 --> 02:12:06.983]  I'm going to destroy the state of California.
[02:12:07.243 --> 02:12:11.526]  And if the federal government tries to stop me from doing it, well, we're just going to fight back.
[02:12:12.046 --> 02:12:16.468]  I'll get all my MS-13 gang members from the Sanctuary City to come out against ICE.
[02:12:16.809 --> 02:12:18.229]  We'll put them all in danger.
[02:12:18.249 --> 02:12:25.794]  And we'll have Libby Schaaf make sure that they're all aware when ICE is coming for them, because they're the gangsters and they run this state now.
[02:12:26.514 --> 02:12:29.257]  Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump think they can fix this state?
[02:12:29.538 --> 02:12:30.699]  Not under my watch!
[02:12:30.999 --> 02:12:32.161]  I'm Jerry Brown!
[02:12:32.421 --> 02:12:33.662]  I'm Governor Jerry Brown!
[02:12:33.903 --> 02:12:35.244]  I'm a gangster thug!
[02:12:35.464 --> 02:12:37.647]  And I'm gonna destroy the state of California!
[02:12:38.007 --> 02:12:39.289]  You wanna move to California?
[02:12:39.989 --> 02:12:40.870]  Oh, no you don't!
[02:12:41.451 --> 02:12:42.071]  No, you don't.
[02:12:42.091 --> 02:12:43.612]  We're run by gangs here now.
[02:12:43.913 --> 02:12:44.893]  You're gonna get stabbed.
[02:12:45.093 --> 02:12:46.114]  You walk around the streets.
[02:12:46.294 --> 02:12:48.115]  You might step in a pile of feces.
[02:12:48.616 --> 02:12:49.036]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.296 --> 02:12:50.577]  Go ahead and move to California.
[02:12:50.777 --> 02:12:52.298]  You think you can afford to live here?
[02:12:52.858 --> 02:12:54.159]  You can't afford Jack!
[02:12:54.439 --> 02:12:56.541]  Unless you're me, Jerry Brown!
[02:12:56.801 --> 02:13:01.544]  Unless you're Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters that live atop their big, big mansions!
[02:13:01.784 --> 02:13:05.967]  And then everyone else lives in swall- poverty in the swalls of society.
[02:13:06.327 --> 02:13:07.107]  I'm Jerry Brown.
[02:13:07.147 --> 02:13:07.888]  I'm a thug.
[02:13:08.228 --> 02:13:09.549]  I run California now.
[02:13:10.933 --> 02:13:13.694]  But this is what happens when you have open borders.
[02:13:14.234 --> 02:13:21.137]  Look at what happens to a Christian Somali woman who goes into a no-go zone in Sweden, which they say doesn't exist.
[02:13:21.537 --> 02:13:21.857]  Really?
[02:13:21.937 --> 02:13:23.278]  Well, how does this happen then?
[02:13:27.752 --> 02:13:34.254]  So she left Islam, she ditches her hijab, and she becomes a Christian.
[02:13:34.594 --> 02:13:40.895]  Now she receives daily threats from the loving Islam radicals.
[02:13:42.376 --> 02:13:46.857]  So now she goes to Rinkby, in one of the no-go zones in Sweden, without her hijab.
[02:13:47.917 --> 02:13:51.898]  And she immediately gains a crowd, people are following her.
[02:13:57.193 --> 02:13:58.413]  See, the gangsters run now.
[02:13:59.133 --> 02:14:00.093]  The thugs run it now.
[02:14:00.113 --> 02:14:03.894]  Now they tell her they cursed her.
[02:14:07.215 --> 02:14:08.035]  They spit at her.
[02:14:08.055 --> 02:14:10.335]  They're angry at her.
[02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:11.116]  They threaten her.
[02:14:12.636 --> 02:14:15.296]  So they have to leave because that's a no-go zone now.
[02:14:15.776 --> 02:14:16.757]  You see, that's an invasion.
[02:14:17.317 --> 02:14:18.157]  You open your borders.
[02:14:19.215 --> 02:14:22.416]  The radical jihadis come in, and then they have a no-go zone.
[02:14:22.456 --> 02:14:23.176]  You're not allowed in.
[02:14:23.556 --> 02:14:25.637]  Because they're so loving and tolerant, after all.
[02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:29.758]  I mean, it's just a disaster.
[02:14:29.778 --> 02:14:35.419]  And so that'll happen in California next.
[02:14:36.179 --> 02:14:39.360]  That'll happen in Minnesota, and it'll happen in California.
[02:14:40.359 --> 02:14:47.024]  And the liberals will say it's the most loving thing ever, and if you don't send your daughter down to the no-go zone, well, you're just hateful!
[02:14:47.705 --> 02:14:49.406]  I mean, you'd be lucky!
[02:14:50.207 --> 02:14:56.151]  You should be honored in Sweden if your daughter goes into the no-go zone and gets raped by a bunch of radical jihadists.
[02:14:56.171 --> 02:14:57.332]  That should be your honor!
[02:14:58.133 --> 02:15:03.417]  How dare you say anything negative about the invasion of
[02:15:06.286 --> 02:15:18.446]  A whole entire crowd of people from the Middle East that then bring their culture of swaller and filth into the beautiful country of Sweden, so now you can't even go out in the streets!
[02:15:19.724 --> 02:15:22.025]  Because it's a no-go zone, because they run it now.
[02:15:22.065 --> 02:15:23.366]  See, it's just like in California.
[02:15:23.626 --> 02:15:25.687]  The thugs run California now.
[02:15:26.327 --> 02:15:40.555]  Now you go to Sweden, we got hijabs on, we got our men, they run the women here, and they run everything, and if you go into that, now it's the, it's like, Swedistan, if you go into the Swedistan, you're not even allowed in.
[02:15:40.935 --> 02:15:43.656]  You better have your hijab on, or we're gonna spit on you, woman.
[02:15:44.397 --> 02:15:46.178]  Because, just like in California,
[02:15:47.361 --> 02:15:50.062]  We the islamicists, we run Sweden now.
[02:15:50.522 --> 02:15:55.824]  Just like the illegal criminals run California, the radical islamicists now run Sweden.
[02:15:56.184 --> 02:15:57.245]  But that's loving.
[02:15:57.325 --> 02:15:59.286]  That's liberal to destroy your culture.
[02:15:59.326 --> 02:16:00.186]  That is liberal.
[02:16:07.418 --> 02:16:13.982]  We've got a bunch of specials running right now that are, in some cases, the biggest we've ever had.
[02:16:14.882 --> 02:16:17.344]  Because I want people to experience how good these products are.
[02:16:17.384 --> 02:16:23.267]  Because we're being censored, because we're being attacked, I ran a bunch of products 50% off, like the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:16:23.687 --> 02:16:27.389]  And like the bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula and others, those sold out.
[02:16:27.409 --> 02:16:33.212]  So we've got 20% off on super high quality body armor, including backpack inserts that are so important for yourself and your children.
[02:16:33.252 --> 02:16:35.873]  This is something just out around town, you name it, it's good to have.
[02:16:36.313 --> 02:16:39.455]  Also, we've got 30 to 80% off site-wide
[02:16:39.735 --> 02:16:49.402]  Massive limited time savings as part of this Operation Paul Revere to defend the First Amendment, defend internet freedom, and of course, on top of all of that, we're going to do this so we can defend the Second Amendment.
[02:16:49.442 --> 02:16:50.583]  We need your financial support.
[02:16:50.603 --> 02:16:56.268]  So if you need water filtration, air filtration, you name it, it's all 30 to 80% off almost all items.
[02:16:56.288 --> 02:16:59.010]  There's a few things where we're making like 30% profit on food.
[02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:00.651]  You can't 30% off or it's at cost.
[02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:01.592]  They won't even let you do that.
[02:17:03.593 --> 02:17:05.434]  So there's a few things in there that are regular price.
[02:17:05.474 --> 02:17:09.657]  Those are already so low, but we already only mark stuff up at regular sell price.
[02:17:09.878 --> 02:17:11.479]  We had a 100% markup, but we're never at 100%.
[02:17:11.539 --> 02:17:13.800]  We're usually at about 50% off markups.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.781]  We're talking 50%.
[02:17:14.921 --> 02:17:19.224]  Everybody else is three, four times markup, and I get it with taxes, regulations, the bureaucracy.
[02:17:19.244 --> 02:17:24.288]  You're running any company, you get lawsuits, you know, just all sorts of, you know, crazy, fake stuff, especially if you're InfoWars.
[02:17:24.328 --> 02:17:26.289]  So what I'm saying is, we need your support.
[02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.990]  We make it easy.
[02:17:27.930 --> 02:17:30.192]  30% off almost all items site-wide to help
[02:17:30.632 --> 02:17:35.696]  Just very important as an independent voice here.
[02:17:36.116 --> 02:17:51.566]  You know, over the last several years, your organization and mine have both become very, very mainstream producers of many health-enhancing products.
[02:17:51.626 --> 02:17:56.049]  And I gotta say, the value of what you're offering people is quite extraordinary.
[02:17:56.089 --> 02:17:59.572]  Because if they go into a retail channel, there's so much markup in the retail channel.
[02:18:00.032 --> 02:18:06.019]  That the ingredients have to be really, really cheapened if it's, you know, at a Whole Foods or at a grocery store or something like that.
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:11.326]  The value of the ingredients that you're putting in because you're selling directly to people is really extraordinary.
[02:18:11.987 --> 02:18:17.553]  I know I've got some of your products in our lab that we're looking at and the potency that we're seeing right now is just super high.
[02:18:18.514 --> 02:18:22.936]  I mean, I know you didn't have me here to endorse your product line, but I know I appreciate you doing it.
[02:18:23.196 --> 02:18:24.257]  Look, I know where to target.
[02:18:24.337 --> 02:18:25.377]  Plus, I want to sell good stuff.
[02:18:25.617 --> 02:18:28.459]  We just go out to the industry leaders and say, what's the strongest turmeric out there?
[02:18:28.799 --> 02:18:32.101]  Well, 450 milligrams with a 90-something curcumin.
[02:18:32.121 --> 02:18:33.801]  I mean, you're an expert on all this.
[02:18:33.841 --> 02:18:35.242]  That's as high as the industry gets.
[02:18:35.522 --> 02:18:36.182]  We go with that.
[02:18:36.202 --> 02:18:39.404]  A lot of folks, as you said, they're going to want to mark stuff up six, seven times.
[02:18:39.424 --> 02:18:40.845]  They want it to be low price.
[02:18:40.865 --> 02:18:43.426]  So it's 30 bucks, but there's a dollar of product.
[02:18:44.066 --> 02:18:45.967]  You see that all the time.
[02:18:46.287 --> 02:18:46.747]  All the time.
[02:18:47.108 --> 02:18:55.071]  And it's the curcuminoids and if you, you know, there's so much amazing scientific research and medical research out there on so many of the benefits of curcumin.
[02:18:55.091 --> 02:18:57.553]  You know, I think we published stories today on that.
[02:18:57.733 --> 02:19:00.674]  It, you know, for sports, for fitness, for recovery, for, you know,
[02:19:00.694 --> 02:19:02.434]  There's a lot we're not supposed to say, but it's known.
[02:19:02.474 --> 02:19:02.914]  Exactly.
[02:19:02.954 --> 02:19:04.315]  There's things we can't say, both of us can't say.
[02:19:04.335 --> 02:19:05.255]  Because the country's so free.
[02:19:05.275 --> 02:19:05.355]  Yeah.
[02:19:05.415 --> 02:19:10.656]  You know, there's thousands of studies of what it does, and it's the ultimate antioxidant.
[02:19:10.716 --> 02:19:12.676]  And so, look, it's sold out in a month.
[02:19:12.716 --> 02:19:16.277]  I did 50% off, and we still made, like, you know, $6, $7 a bottle.
[02:19:16.297 --> 02:19:19.018]  Now it's going to be regular price, and it's still a good deal.
[02:19:19.058 --> 02:19:21.378]  But I want folks to see how good it is.
[02:19:21.818 --> 02:19:24.039]  So, you know, that's sold out.
[02:19:24.079 --> 02:19:25.419]  The point is, is that we've got
[02:19:26.019 --> 02:19:34.945]  Uh, clearance, apparel 80% off, three-way 50% off, Aegis body armor 20% off, InfoWars life, mind and body, uh, that is 40% off.
[02:19:35.025 --> 02:19:36.246]  And I'm gonna stop right there.
[02:19:36.687 --> 02:19:45.353]  All I'm saying is, please support the broadcast and take advantage of this and let the globalists know no matter how hardcore their attacks are, you're gonna continue to support us because they just...
[02:19:46.033 --> 02:19:50.217]  They just had a big site yesterday claiming they weren't sponsoring us anymore, and they never sponsored us.
[02:19:50.477 --> 02:19:53.420]  But they were trying to get other sponsors to pull.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:54.300]  It was a total hoax.
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:54.701]  Of course.
[02:19:55.021 --> 02:19:55.802]  That's what they do all the time.
[02:19:55.862 --> 02:19:57.163]  It's all a disinfo war.
[02:20:06.251 --> 02:20:08.873]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.215 --> 02:20:17.696]  We're all living in America!
[02:20:18.036 --> 02:20:19.496]  America!
[02:20:19.516 --> 02:20:21.557]  It's wunderbar!
[02:20:21.877 --> 02:20:25.098]  We're all living in America!
[02:20:25.218 --> 02:20:25.778]  America!
[02:20:26.118 --> 02:20:27.038]  America!
[02:20:27.058 --> 02:20:31.559]  We're all living in America!
[02:20:31.579 --> 02:20:34.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:36.085 --> 02:20:45.310]  I am going to commit to just covering the rest of this news before I hand over the baton to Roger Stone, who's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:20:45.911 --> 02:20:52.975]  We may even have time to squeeze in some of your phone calls, but before I get off track with that, let me just go headlong into this news here.
[02:20:53.855 --> 02:20:56.478]  Again, some of the biggest stories today.
[02:20:57.339 --> 02:21:08.731]  A teenager in Utah tried to detonate a homemade bomb at Pineview High School, said to be inspired by ISIS, boasts about how ISIS is coming and will be victorious.
[02:21:09.672 --> 02:21:15.158]  One has to wonder how he gets that message into his head, who is telling him that, and if it is via social media.
[02:21:16.059 --> 02:21:28.650]  Why is YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter so obsessed with shutting us down, but not stopping people that are actually trying to promote people to do terrorist attacks in the name of ISIS?
[02:21:29.851 --> 02:21:32.113]  So, that situation happened.
[02:21:32.133 --> 02:21:36.377]  Again, another attack, or what would have been an attack on a school.
[02:21:37.759 --> 02:21:45.142]  You have the Trump DOJ with Sessions making a statement today suing California over interference with immigration enforcement.
[02:21:45.642 --> 02:21:47.723]  Libby Schaaf needs to be put in jail.
[02:21:47.743 --> 02:21:49.784]  I mean, it's like, what do you even do?
[02:21:49.844 --> 02:21:52.024]  California is so messed up.
[02:21:52.585 --> 02:21:54.145]  It's like, how do you even fix that?
[02:21:54.245 --> 02:21:55.506]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:21:55.866 --> 02:21:56.546]  See, here's the problem.
[02:21:56.726 --> 02:21:58.827]  You know, you want to know what the actual problem is?
[02:22:02.475 --> 02:22:03.256]  And I just want to be clear.
[02:22:03.757 --> 02:22:05.138]  I'm not saying this is what I want.
[02:22:05.358 --> 02:22:08.943]  I'm not saying this is what should happen because this is not what should happen in America.
[02:22:10.425 --> 02:22:13.949]  But honestly, you know the only way to fix California is an authoritarian.
[02:22:14.269 --> 02:22:22.219]  The only way to actually fix California is for a dictator to come in and probably either fire or jail
[02:22:23.917 --> 02:22:28.519]  All politicians out of California, at least those on the Democrat side.
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:31.061]  And again, I'm not saying that's what should happen.
[02:22:31.241 --> 02:22:34.623]  I'm saying that's actually probably the only hope that California would have.
[02:22:35.063 --> 02:22:39.645]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Jerry Brown, Libby Schaaf.
[02:22:39.685 --> 02:22:42.807]  I mean, these people have destroyed the state of California, folks.
[02:22:43.327 --> 02:22:44.107]  And who knows?
[02:22:44.147 --> 02:22:46.008]  I mean, where are all the highway funds going?
[02:22:46.028 --> 02:22:47.309]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:22:50.453 --> 02:22:53.716]  Anyway, but California's not going to stop acting illegally.
[02:22:53.736 --> 02:23:04.166]  They're going to continue to do their sanctuary cities, continue to have open borders, continue to have illegal voting, continue to have feces in the streets, continue to have needles in the streets, continue to have just rampant homelessness everywhere.
[02:23:04.506 --> 02:23:08.130]  That's the liberal fashion of California.
[02:23:10.456 --> 02:23:13.977]  More good news, even though there was a bit of a hiccup.
[02:23:14.037 --> 02:23:16.558]  Actually, I think it probably recovered, the stock market today.
[02:23:16.598 --> 02:23:21.000]  But private sector jobs grow by 235,000 in February.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:24.622]  That's 40,000 more than expected.
[02:23:24.742 --> 02:23:28.123]  So the job market continues to grow under President Trump.
[02:23:28.163 --> 02:23:31.284]  But somehow these bums can't find a job.
[02:23:32.145 --> 02:23:33.025]  Now this is really one.
[02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:37.191]  Cable goes nuts for Nunberg.
[02:23:37.351 --> 02:23:40.874]  It's almost perfect his name is Nunberg because it's a nun story.
[02:23:41.695 --> 02:23:46.678]  CNN spends nearly 75% of airtime on former Trump aide.
[02:23:47.339 --> 02:23:52.302]  CNN spent 3 hours and 50 minutes on Nunberg, an hour 23 minutes on everything else.
[02:23:52.322 --> 02:23:53.523]  This is from 3.30 to 11.
[02:23:53.863 --> 02:23:57.546]  And then MSNBC pretty much the exact same story.
[02:23:57.646 --> 02:24:02.490]  And it turns out the guy, I mean, I'm not trying to insult the guy, but the guy was a drunk.
[02:24:04.915 --> 02:24:05.395]  So think about it.
[02:24:06.095 --> 02:24:08.836]  The left has now been trolled by a drunk twice.
[02:24:09.937 --> 02:24:12.297]  Papadopoulos gets drunk and runs his mouth.
[02:24:12.818 --> 02:24:15.399]  And then Nunberg gets drunk and runs his mouth.
[02:24:16.179 --> 02:24:19.080]  And the liberals put him on, even though they probably knew he was a drunk.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:20.160]  I mean, heck, they're all drunk.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:22.141]  And so they put him on.
[02:24:23.274 --> 02:24:30.300]  And then he embarrasses himself and embarrasses CNN and then Aaron Burnett says, you sound and smell like you've had a few adult beverages.
[02:24:31.061 --> 02:24:32.502]  You knew that the whole time!
[02:24:32.962 --> 02:24:37.446]  And the only reason you called him out for that is because he didn't go along with your fake news narrative.
[02:24:39.027 --> 02:24:39.688]  Hilarious.
[02:24:40.408 --> 02:24:42.450]  The left can be trolled so easily right now.
[02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:49.436]  That's why CNN is sending a news crew to go cover an Instagram model in Thailand.
[02:24:53.218 --> 02:24:53.320]  Ugh.
[02:24:54.653 --> 02:24:55.854]  Talk about election meddling.
[02:24:55.914 --> 02:24:58.836]  Nobody seems to have a problem with George Soros and the Democrat Party.
[02:24:59.436 --> 02:25:02.178]  They're too busy looking up each other's butts for Russian collusion.
[02:25:02.198 --> 02:25:04.399]  They're ignoring George Soros, who funds them all anyway.
[02:25:04.879 --> 02:25:09.982]  Soros chalks up another district attorney win after dropping nearly $1 million in Texas race.
[02:25:10.443 --> 02:25:15.786]  Soros poured $7 million into 11 district attorney races across the country in 2015 and 2016.
[02:25:16.486 --> 02:25:23.451]  He's approaching, like, over $50 million when you look at all the consortium of all of the local elections that he's been funding.
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.566]  Where's the Soros meddling?
[02:25:26.586 --> 02:25:28.391]  Where's the Soros influence on the election?
[02:25:28.431 --> 02:25:29.373]  Nobody cares about that.
[02:25:30.456 --> 02:25:32.040]  A Nazi collaborator admitted it.
[02:25:33.843 --> 02:25:38.607]  The CIA warns of extensive Chinese operation to infiltrate American institutions.
[02:25:38.727 --> 02:25:46.793]  And then, this has been a story for a long time, and then President Trump, so you've got the trade wars going on, China wants to do something about the $1 billion deficit, Trump says.
[02:25:47.274 --> 02:25:52.358]  Then Trump tweets out today, talking about the... Go to Trump's Twitter.
[02:25:52.518 --> 02:25:55.200]  Now, he didn't mention China in this, if I'm recalling correctly.
[02:25:56.661 --> 02:25:59.824]  The United States needs to do something about the theft of intellectual property.
[02:26:00.164 --> 02:26:02.186]  Folks, that is China.
[02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:10.023]  And I don't think he mentioned China in the tweet, but that is 110% China.
[02:26:11.983 --> 02:26:13.104]  Who he's calling out with that?
[02:26:15.284 --> 02:26:18.065]  China's the one that's been stealing intellectual property from America.
[02:26:18.665 --> 02:26:20.826]  You've had cases covered in mainstream news.
[02:26:21.206 --> 02:26:23.546]  Trump calls out China on Twitter today to talk about that.
[02:26:23.887 --> 02:26:27.688]  This is in the middle of the trade war, in the middle of trying to fix the deficit with China.
[02:26:28.788 --> 02:26:28.988]  So...
[02:26:30.393 --> 02:26:35.435]  So that's, you know, pretty heavy stuff there from the president.
[02:26:35.495 --> 02:26:42.358]  Alright, I will get to, I've got still two massive stacks of news that I need to get to.
[02:26:42.718 --> 02:26:52.402]  One on the failing of liberal policies, and then the other one on just the absolute nonsense of liberal policies.
[02:26:52.422 --> 02:26:55.504]  So we'll have both of those when we come back from this break.
[02:26:56.468 --> 02:26:59.391]  Getting ready for Roger Stone to host the fourth hour.
[02:26:59.431 --> 02:27:02.875]  But folks, again, we are under attack.
[02:27:03.035 --> 02:27:09.882]  Lawsuits, censorship, DDoS attacks, pretty much everything that you can imagine here at InfoWars.
[02:27:09.962 --> 02:27:11.584]  So we are launching specials.
[02:27:12.845 --> 02:27:17.450]  Now, when we have popular products and when we are in demand,
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:18.920]  For
[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:36.141]  Most of the store is about 50% off.
[02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:37.561]  A lot of the store is 30% off.
[02:27:37.661 --> 02:27:40.422]  Up to 80% off some of the apparel right now.
[02:27:40.882 --> 02:27:42.422]  And then free shipping store-wide.
[02:27:42.442 --> 02:27:52.265]  So if you're looking at a big ticket item like emergency food supplies or a water filter or an air filter, free shipping is going to save you a lot of money on those products.
[02:27:52.625 --> 02:27:55.706]  But 50% off Supermail and Super Female Vitality.
[02:27:55.726 --> 02:27:58.006]  50% off the Real Red Pill.
[02:27:58.326 --> 02:28:00.867]  50% off Biome Defense 50, the probiotic.
[02:28:01.968 --> 02:28:04.010]  50% off True Whey Protein.

[02:28:07.814 --> 02:28:11.878]  And again, free shipping store wide.
[02:28:12.399 --> 02:28:14.020]  So take advantage of these specials.
[02:28:14.161 --> 02:28:15.282]  Help fund the InfoWare.
[02:28:15.902 --> 02:28:20.627]  If you're watching CNN or MSNBC and you're like, man, what can I do?
[02:28:21.508 --> 02:28:27.876]  To defeat Rachel Maddow, who just got the number one rating in primetime television for news.
[02:28:28.317 --> 02:28:29.478]  Rachel Maddow.
[02:28:29.839 --> 02:28:32.382]  Now I theorize that's because it's like a circus.
[02:28:32.522 --> 02:28:36.447]  I mean, she's basically just like a three-ring circus up there, but...
[02:28:37.148 --> 02:28:38.469]  She defeated Hannity in the ratings.
[02:28:39.109 --> 02:28:48.416]  But if that bothers you, and you want to see someone replace that, you want to see real news replace fake news, go to InfoWarsStore.com and support our expansion.

[02:28:55.741 --> 02:28:58.943]  Alright, I'm going to clear through this stack of news on the other side of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:58.963 --> 02:28:59.504]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.103]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[02:29:14.907 --> 02:29:18.850]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:25.092]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[02:29:25.272 --> 02:29:31.633]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:29:31.873 --> 02:29:41.996]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:29:42.236 --> 02:29:48.658]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:29:49.038 --> 02:29:51.638]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[02:29:51.898 --> 02:29:55.219]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[02:29:55.519 --> 02:30:00.440]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:10.252]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:30:10.292 --> 02:30:10.832]  You're on the air.
[02:30:10.852 --> 02:30:11.373]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:11.753 --> 02:30:12.873]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:30:13.053 --> 02:30:13.674]  Hey, brother.
[02:30:13.994 --> 02:30:14.334]  Good, man.
[02:30:14.374 --> 02:30:15.475]  Thank you for calling.
[02:30:15.515 --> 02:30:20.318]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:30:20.518 --> 02:30:26.902]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:30:27.022 --> 02:30:28.743]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[02:30:28.823 --> 02:30:35.647]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:30:36.127 --> 02:30:37.248]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:30:37.308 --> 02:30:41.310]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:30:41.711 --> 02:30:43.392]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:30:43.772 --> 02:30:44.492]  And exactly.
[02:30:44.512 --> 02:30:48.755]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:30:49.115 --> 02:30:49.396]  Boom!
[02:30:49.536 --> 02:30:52.357]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:30:52.417 --> 02:30:52.958]  It's amazing.
[02:30:52.978 --> 02:30:57.241]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:31:07.242 --> 02:31:12.244]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified Libtards on Twitter.
[02:31:12.344 --> 02:31:15.005]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[02:31:15.085 --> 02:31:21.067]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[02:31:21.107 --> 02:31:23.447]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[02:31:23.587 --> 02:31:31.770]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[02:31:31.850 --> 02:31:34.731]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[02:31:35.151 --> 02:31:44.839]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[02:31:44.919 --> 02:31:48.161]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[02:31:48.261 --> 02:31:55.967]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:56.008 --> 02:31:57.028]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:31:57.108 --> 02:31:59.170]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.411]  It was hilarious.
[02:32:02.332 --> 02:32:04.534]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[02:32:04.654 --> 02:32:14.460]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:16.902]  This isn't like some pokey snake oil.
[02:32:17.522 --> 02:32:23.946]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[02:32:24.527 --> 02:32:26.168]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:33.637]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brain Force.
[02:32:33.697 --> 02:32:35.820]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.341]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[02:32:37.422 --> 02:32:37.662]  Good.
[02:32:37.922 --> 02:32:39.224]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[02:32:39.404 --> 02:32:44.129]  You're literally making Info Wars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[02:32:44.409 --> 02:32:46.492]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[02:32:46.892 --> 02:32:49.274]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[02:32:49.615 --> 02:32:52.517]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[02:32:52.557 --> 02:32:54.018]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[02:32:54.038 --> 02:32:55.059]  BrainForce Plus.
[02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:58.022]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:08.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.954 --> 02:33:28.518]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.998 --> 02:33:32.621]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.921 --> 02:33:41.606]  Alright, News Blitz time here in the final half hour for me before Roger Stone takes over for the fourth hour.
[02:33:41.926 --> 02:33:44.268]  Let's just delve right in here without hesitation.
[02:33:44.868 --> 02:33:46.469]  This was a story from Yahoo News today.
[02:33:48.450 --> 02:33:58.673]  The backdrop to this is conservative news outlets and everyone is reporting how Democrats are basically and have been meeting with Louis Farrakhan for a long time.
[02:33:58.713 --> 02:33:59.954]  There was a big secret meeting.
[02:34:00.014 --> 02:34:01.274]  Obama was there, the whole thing.
[02:34:01.875 --> 02:34:04.475]  And so this kind of goes to the mainstream now and it's undeniable.
[02:34:05.496 --> 02:34:10.697]  And so Yahoo asks, do liberals have a Louis Farrakhan problem for the midterms?
[02:34:10.838 --> 02:34:12.058]  Well, the answer to this is no.
[02:34:13.118 --> 02:34:13.538]  No, they don't.
[02:34:14.319 --> 02:34:15.079]  Of course they don't.
[02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:18.450]  This is what the liberals are doing now.
[02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:19.891]  They are the group of hate.
[02:34:21.711 --> 02:34:25.912]  Why would they have a problem with Louis Farrakhan for the midterms?
[02:34:27.173 --> 02:34:30.333]  That's like saying, do liberals have a George Soros problem?
[02:34:31.274 --> 02:34:35.555]  Well, okay, they should, but they don't.
[02:34:36.415 --> 02:34:36.995]  Same with this.
[02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:44.537]  Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, if Trump says, oh, Trump says build the wall,
[02:34:45.686 --> 02:34:47.266]  A Trump rally chants build that wall.
[02:34:47.606 --> 02:34:48.907]  That's a bunch of Nazis.
[02:34:49.067 --> 02:34:50.187]  That's a bunch of racists.
[02:34:50.367 --> 02:34:51.747]  That's a bunch of xenophobes.
[02:34:52.828 --> 02:35:02.550]  But if Louis Farrakhan says the Jews are to blame for everything, you know, burn Jews, take down the white man, black supremacy, loving, liberal, tolerant.
[02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:06.751]  So of course the liberals don't have a Louis Farrakhan problem.
[02:35:06.771 --> 02:35:09.592]  That's not going to stop any liberal from voting Democrat.
[02:35:11.052 --> 02:35:12.432]  This has been known.
[02:35:16.297 --> 02:35:17.518]  No, there is no problem.
[02:35:17.838 --> 02:35:19.539]  The liberals are already the party of hate.
[02:35:22.721 --> 02:35:26.263]  The Democrat Party is the party of the KKK!
[02:35:26.964 --> 02:35:28.885]  Do the Democrats have a KKK problem?
[02:35:29.446 --> 02:35:29.786]  Nope.
[02:35:31.167 --> 02:35:32.868]  So of course there's not going to be a problem with this.
[02:35:34.804 --> 02:35:44.194]  They got radical liberals they go out in the street, they bash people with bike locks, they spray women with pepper spray, they shoot Republicans at a baseball practice.
[02:35:44.734 --> 02:35:47.437]  Louis Farrakhan is the least of their problems.
[02:35:47.477 --> 02:35:50.400]  Yeah, they have radical Linda Cockroach Sarsour.
[02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:52.463]  I mean, take her off the screen!
[02:35:52.563 --> 02:35:54.425]  I cannot stand her face!
[02:35:56.207 --> 02:35:57.228]  Woman makes me sick!
[02:36:00.078 --> 02:36:01.839]  This woman... You know what?
[02:36:01.879 --> 02:36:02.540]  I'm not even gonna say it.
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:03.780]  I'm not even gonna say it, okay?
[02:36:04.381 --> 02:36:05.402]  I just don't get it.
[02:36:06.322 --> 02:36:07.143]  I just don't get it.
[02:36:07.483 --> 02:36:09.824]  Why do people come to America and still wear their hijab?
[02:36:10.405 --> 02:36:10.965]  I'm just gonna say it.
[02:36:11.225 --> 02:36:12.206]  Can someone explain this to me?
[02:36:15.134 --> 02:36:16.474]  I'm not trying to sound insensitive.
[02:36:16.574 --> 02:36:17.675]  I feel bad for these women.
[02:36:18.055 --> 02:36:19.495]  They've been put under this control.
[02:36:19.535 --> 02:36:20.735]  They've been put under the control.
[02:36:21.015 --> 02:36:22.436]  They've been dominated by Islam.
[02:36:22.556 --> 02:36:23.256]  Is that what it is?
[02:36:23.296 --> 02:36:28.397]  They're just so used to being dominated by this oppressive religion, they can't even take off their headscarf?
[02:36:28.717 --> 02:36:29.537]  Take it off!
[02:36:30.177 --> 02:36:37.039]  Women in America that are wearing a hijab, I challenge you to take it off.
[02:36:37.559 --> 02:36:39.019]  No one will oppress you here.
[02:36:39.559 --> 02:36:41.620]  I guess, unless you're with your Muslim husband.
[02:36:43.934 --> 02:36:44.614]  Oh, now I get it.
[02:36:45.115 --> 02:36:49.057]  If you remove your hijab, you'll get raped, abused, and acid thrown on you.
[02:36:49.217 --> 02:36:49.698]  Now I get it.
[02:36:49.818 --> 02:36:50.058]  Okay.
[02:36:50.518 --> 02:36:50.898]  That's nice.
[02:36:55.261 --> 02:36:56.522]  I'm just gonna leave it right there.
[02:36:57.182 --> 02:36:59.704]  Chelsea Clinton, criticism of Ivanka is fair game.
[02:36:59.724 --> 02:37:03.326]  So Chelsea Clinton goes on the Stephen Colbert show.
[02:37:04.915 --> 02:37:08.178]  And says, yeah, you know, criticize Ivanka, of course, of course.
[02:37:08.458 --> 02:37:09.018]  Now, whatever.
[02:37:09.258 --> 02:37:09.919]  I don't really care.
[02:37:09.939 --> 02:37:10.559]  You know what?
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:11.941]  You can criticize Ivanka, of course.
[02:37:11.981 --> 02:37:13.922]  She's going to say things that are worthy of criticism.
[02:37:14.803 --> 02:37:16.924]  It's the fact that they do this.
[02:37:18.225 --> 02:37:19.446]  We're the party for women.
[02:37:19.506 --> 02:37:20.527]  Don't attack a woman.
[02:37:20.547 --> 02:37:22.228]  Oh, well, yeah, attack Ivanka, though.
[02:37:22.268 --> 02:37:23.870]  That's fine.
[02:37:23.890 --> 02:37:24.330]  That's cool.
[02:37:24.951 --> 02:37:27.513]  How dare you attack any Democrat female?
[02:37:27.553 --> 02:37:28.874]  How dare you attack Hillary Clinton?
[02:37:29.174 --> 02:37:31.095]  How dare you not vote for Hillary Clinton?
[02:37:31.115 --> 02:37:31.796]  Because she's a woman.
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:39.443]  And then Chelsea Clinton goes on the Stephen Colbert Report and says, yeah, you can attack Ivanka.
[02:37:39.463 --> 02:37:40.123]  That's fair game.
[02:37:40.684 --> 02:37:43.545]  Don't attack my mom, though.
[02:37:44.165 --> 02:37:49.267]  That's not fair game, even though she brags about starting wars in Libya.
[02:37:49.967 --> 02:37:53.009]  She's responsible for Benghazi and all this stuff.
[02:37:53.289 --> 02:37:54.429]  Don't attack her, though.
[02:37:55.010 --> 02:37:55.730]  Attack Ivanka.
[02:37:56.310 --> 02:37:57.531]  She's the problem here.
[02:37:57.551 --> 02:38:00.132]  Ivanka is the problem here, not my mom.
[02:38:01.943 --> 02:38:04.365]  And so that's what the Colbert Report does now.
[02:38:04.746 --> 02:38:08.229]  Bring on Chelsea Clinton and tell people to attack Ivanka Trump.
[02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:09.370]  Good.
[02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:10.030]  Glad.
[02:38:10.351 --> 02:38:11.572]  Way to go, Chelsea Hubble.
[02:38:13.127 --> 02:38:15.629]  Conservative students say government bill would put us at risk.
[02:38:15.669 --> 02:38:16.891]  Now this is a huge deal.
[02:38:17.031 --> 02:38:27.640]  The Rider University student government recently passed a bill allowing it to quote-unquote question the status of student groups that it deems to engage inflammatory, hateful, or derogatory rhetoric.
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:36.568]  So they say this, they can basically shut down a group if it's guilty of hate speech, if it's guilty of abusive speech, or whatever they determine that is.
[02:38:37.728 --> 02:38:38.849]  And so what does that mean, folks?
[02:38:38.869 --> 02:38:40.190]  Well, you know exactly what that means.
[02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:42.871]  That means, you know who's in the crosshairs?
[02:38:43.112 --> 02:38:47.775]  The college Republicans, the college conservatives, the Trump-supporting groups.
[02:38:48.275 --> 02:38:49.876]  They're in the crosshairs.
[02:38:49.896 --> 02:38:49.956]  Why?
[02:38:51.137 --> 02:39:01.264]  Because mentally ill liberals have now been brainwashed and indoctrinated to believe that if you like Trump, you like America, you like borders, you're a Republican, you're a conservative,
[02:39:02.861 --> 02:39:09.083]  Or you don't believe in man-made climate change, you're a Nazi, you're hateful, you're a bigot, so you must be shut down.
[02:39:09.723 --> 02:39:13.625]  And then they're the authoritarian thought police that run the entire thing.
[02:39:13.845 --> 02:39:15.565]  See, this is what I was talking about earlier with David Hogg.
[02:39:16.365 --> 02:39:23.628]  David Hogg has been fully indoctrinated by the liberals now, where he's got the higher, mightier-than-thou arrogance.
[02:39:24.248 --> 02:39:26.729]  I'm bigger than the president, he should listen to me.
[02:39:28.103 --> 02:39:53.363]  So now they've indoctrinated poor David Hogg, they use these kids as political pawns, now he's fully indoctrinated into the arrogant liberal, and then, because they have this arrogance, they're high and mighty, they have the moral high ground, I'm a good liberal, you're guilty of hate speech, you're shut down, and Trump is an authoritarian dictator, I'm shutting you down.
[02:39:54.624 --> 02:39:56.025]  And so this is what they're doing.
[02:39:56.914 --> 02:40:00.735]  And it doesn't even matter that the entire notion of it is a lie.
[02:40:02.416 --> 02:40:11.319]  Folks, see, this is why, it's like, I don't even know, it's so 1984 in your face, it's like, how do you even explain it?
[02:40:11.459 --> 02:40:11.759]  Okay.
[02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:13.560]  Neutral.
[02:40:14.926 --> 02:40:15.928]  Go to a Trump rally.
[02:40:16.408 --> 02:40:17.230]  Go to a Trump event.
[02:40:17.350 --> 02:40:20.715]  Go to a conservative event, as a neutral, and see how you're treated.
[02:40:21.076 --> 02:40:21.937]  You're going to be loved.
[02:40:21.957 --> 02:40:22.839]  You're going to be embraced.
[02:40:22.859 --> 02:40:24.201]  You're going to have great conversations.
[02:40:24.221 --> 02:40:25.082]  You're going to learn things.
[02:40:25.102 --> 02:40:26.264]  You're going to teach people things.
[02:40:26.324 --> 02:40:27.386]  It's going to be uplifting.
[02:40:27.406 --> 02:40:29.029]  It's going to be a good experience.
[02:40:30.359 --> 02:40:32.280]  And even, I'll tell you what, take it a step further.
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:39.603]  Go to a conservative event, a Trump event, whatever you have you, as a Bernie supporter, as a Hillary supporter, but go open-minded.
[02:40:40.323 --> 02:40:42.064]  And actually engage in a conversation.
[02:40:42.324 --> 02:40:43.084]  Share ideas.
[02:40:43.444 --> 02:40:46.005]  Be open to different ideas, different thoughts.
[02:40:46.626 --> 02:40:47.586]  And you'll be accepted.
[02:40:47.686 --> 02:40:48.527]  You'll be welcomed.
[02:40:48.667 --> 02:40:50.707]  It won't be a negative experience for you.
[02:40:51.328 --> 02:40:51.508]  Now.
[02:40:52.372 --> 02:40:53.512]  Take that in the other direction.
[02:40:53.812 --> 02:40:56.353]  Go as a Trump supporter to any sort of Democrat event.
[02:40:56.393 --> 02:40:57.473]  In fact, you don't even have to do that.
[02:40:57.854 --> 02:41:00.594]  Go out as a Trump supporter just on the streets of your city.
[02:41:00.994 --> 02:41:02.035]  Go out as a Trump supporter.
[02:41:02.055 --> 02:41:04.235]  Wear a Trump hat, a Trump t-shirt, an Infowars shirt.
[02:41:04.495 --> 02:41:05.696]  Walk around the streets of Seattle.
[02:41:05.916 --> 02:41:07.016]  Walk around the streets of New York.
[02:41:08.036 --> 02:41:09.677]  Who do you think is the party of hate?
[02:41:11.257 --> 02:41:12.958]  It's not even an argument.
[02:41:13.928 --> 02:41:31.036]  How many times do I have to go out on the streets, get spat on, get thrown at, get my equipment broke, get insulted, get cursed at, get lied about, get called names, until people realize that the left, the modern day left, is the biggest hate group in the history of America.
[02:41:31.436 --> 02:41:33.217]  But then they moral high ground you.
[02:41:34.392 --> 02:41:45.967]  Say that you're a dictator and then become a dictator of thought police and ban everything that you do because they decided it's hate speech even though they're the most hateful group of people this planet has ever seen.
[02:41:46.387 --> 02:41:51.634]  Bunch of mentally deranged, hateful individuals in a death cult.
[02:41:52.708 --> 02:41:54.909]  I'm sorry, I'm getting off track here.
[02:41:55.629 --> 02:41:57.530]  This is from Jamie White at Infowars.com.
[02:41:58.050 --> 02:42:00.410]  Satanists sue to stop pro-life law.
[02:42:00.450 --> 02:42:06.952]  So in the state of Missouri, before you get an abortion, they tell you, you know, you realize you're stopping a beating heart.
[02:42:07.353 --> 02:42:09.493]  You're basically killing a person right now.
[02:42:09.653 --> 02:42:11.114]  Are you sure you want to go through with this?
[02:42:11.874 --> 02:42:12.754]  That's what they used to do.
[02:42:13.475 --> 02:42:15.835]  But now they are saying you cannot do that.
[02:42:16.355 --> 02:42:17.836]  That's illegal.
[02:42:17.956 --> 02:42:20.757]  So now you're not allowed to warn people about aborting a baby.
[02:42:22.097 --> 02:42:27.680]  Sick, twisted, disgusting, death cult behavior from the left again.
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:31.181]  You want to know what will happen, folks, if they stop food stamps?
[02:42:31.221 --> 02:42:32.242]  And this is the scariest thing.
[02:42:32.282 --> 02:42:33.182]  This is the mental illness.
[02:42:33.663 --> 02:42:38.125]  A man was so angry over a power outage, he threatened a utility worker.
[02:42:38.885 --> 02:42:47.149]  In New Jersey, a man without power, because of the Nor'easter, threatened a utility worker with terrorist threats because they couldn't get the power back on.
[02:42:51.001 --> 02:42:53.225]  We'll have more liberal nonsense on the other side.
[02:42:53.305 --> 02:42:54.968]  It's just all mental illness, folks.
[02:42:55.048 --> 02:42:56.150]  These people are mentally ill.
[02:42:56.391 --> 02:42:56.952]  They need help.
[02:42:57.553 --> 02:42:58.795]  Open the mental institutions.
[02:42:58.975 --> 02:42:59.797]  Throw the liberals in them.
[02:43:03.648 --> 02:43:08.510]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:43:08.791 --> 02:43:13.253]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:43:13.573 --> 02:43:21.918]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:43:22.258 --> 02:43:25.500]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:30.687]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:43:31.007 --> 02:43:37.977]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:43:38.318 --> 02:43:41.943]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:43:42.243 --> 02:43:42.764]  That's why.
[02:43:43.044 --> 02:43:46.547]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:43:46.947 --> 02:43:54.714]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:43:55.034 --> 02:43:58.937]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[02:43:59.238 --> 02:44:00.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:04.466 --> 02:44:22.439]  We are joined via Skype from Japan by Steven Seagal, the famous actor and of course famous black belt in martial arts, a friend of Vladimir Putin, of course a friend of President Trump, a friend of so many, and of course a well-known American patriot.
[02:44:23.079 --> 02:44:27.442]  Who we notice has been demonized in the press quite a bit as of late.
[02:44:27.642 --> 02:44:34.486]  Steven Seagal has also now written a best-selling book dealing with the wolves of the deep state.
[02:44:34.606 --> 02:44:37.688]  Dealing with all the incredible things that are happening.
[02:44:37.728 --> 02:44:49.555]  And Steven Seagal, because of his close relationship with President Putin, and because he's been a peacemaker, and because he's been a goodwill ambassador, because a part of his family are from Russia,
[02:44:50.235 --> 02:44:56.777]  Obviously, there are women who have really been assaulted.
[02:44:57.418 --> 02:45:06.181]  And as a police officer for many years, you know, I saw this and was honored and able to help people who are in real distress, real trouble.
[02:45:07.539 --> 02:45:12.563]  We want nothing more than to be able to defend those people and help them.
[02:45:13.104 --> 02:45:24.032]  The thing that is an evil tragedy that is going on now is, like I said, people paying people to lie.
[02:45:24.973 --> 02:45:41.878]  For their own political agenda and because maybe they want to assassinate their enemy and destroy their name and reputation and family and family life and marriage and ability to earn money.
[02:45:42.659 --> 02:45:43.759]  There are a million reasons.
[02:45:44.279 --> 02:45:54.866]  There's a woman called Michelle Milken who stood up and said, listen, when people make claims, they lie.
[02:45:55.467 --> 02:45:57.248]  They lie for a multitude of reasons.
[02:45:57.288 --> 02:46:01.331]  They lie because they want to annihilate their enemies.
[02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:02.892]  They lie for money.
[02:46:02.912 --> 02:46:05.714]  They lie because they want to become famous and get in the news.
[02:46:06.554 --> 02:46:10.015]  And, you know, she said, I'm not just making this up.
[02:46:10.415 --> 02:46:29.858]  I'm the one who's gotten into the FBI files, and the LAO files, and law enforcement files, and I've gone over all the statistics, and I can tell you, by my research, my meticulous analytical research, I can tell you that up to 40% of these claims are fake.
[02:46:30.538 --> 02:46:34.839]  Well, I personally think in Hollywood right now, it's a lot bigger number.
[02:46:36.423 --> 02:46:48.266]  What I'm saying is, and I've said before, what some of these people don't realize is this is part of a plan to collapse the United States of America.
[02:46:48.306 --> 02:46:55.987]  Because if the news becomes bigger and bigger, we won't know, the people will not know what's real and what's really happening.
[02:46:56.007 --> 02:46:59.848]  If the people don't know what's really happening, what do we have, Alex?
[02:47:06.335 --> 02:47:16.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.465 --> 02:47:25.046]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.286 --> 02:47:30.929]  Owen Schroer here in the driver's seat, about to hand the baton over to Roger Stone for the fourth hour.
[02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:35.232]  I've got a stack of news I need to report on here before I do that though, but
[02:47:37.324 --> 02:47:41.265]  It's not racist to report on facts.
[02:47:41.445 --> 02:47:51.527]  It's not insensitive, it's not intolerant, it's not xenophobic, or whatever you want to say, to call it as it is, to call it as you see it, to report on facts.
[02:47:52.267 --> 02:47:59.968]  Now, the indoctrinated, brainwashed, Stockholm Syndrome liberal, unfortunately thinks that way.
[02:48:00.568 --> 02:48:01.589]  This is the mental illness.
[02:48:02.429 --> 02:48:03.329]  Now why am I saying this?
[02:48:04.744 --> 02:48:07.025]  You've got a story on the Geller Report.
[02:48:07.065 --> 02:48:10.766]  This is from Pamela Geller, who, by the way, is under all kinds of attack, folks.
[02:48:10.966 --> 02:48:13.447]  I mean, it's just crazy what she has to deal with.
[02:48:14.587 --> 02:48:16.428]  And she reports on this story from India.
[02:48:17.108 --> 02:48:21.230]  Muslims gang-rape Hindu girl after she refuses to convert to Islam.
[02:48:22.290 --> 02:48:23.231]  Now let me explain something.
[02:48:29.513 --> 02:48:29.913]  Why
[02:48:32.250 --> 02:48:33.271]  How do you explain this?
[02:48:33.931 --> 02:48:58.526]  You shouldn't have to, but is it considered intolerant if you look at what goes on right now in many aspects of the religion of Islam, and you see how they treat women, you see how they treat homosexuals, see how they treat goats, and you just say,
[02:48:59.465 --> 02:49:01.206]  You know, I just don't want that here.
[02:49:01.927 --> 02:49:06.571]  I'm sorry, that's not what America's about, and that's what we don't want here.
[02:49:07.572 --> 02:49:09.053]  Okay, well you're considered intolerant.
[02:49:09.333 --> 02:49:10.374]  You're considered insensitive.
[02:49:11.235 --> 02:49:11.995]  But why is that?
[02:49:12.115 --> 02:49:16.039]  Why is it that you're considered insensitive because you don't want people
[02:49:18.268 --> 02:49:22.213]  Who torture and kill gays, torture and kill women that don't wear a hijab.
[02:49:23.094 --> 02:49:24.675]  That's the insensitive culture!
[02:49:24.796 --> 02:49:26.217]  That's the intolerant culture!
[02:49:26.518 --> 02:49:30.843]  But then if you're intolerant of their intolerance, you're the bad guy!
[02:49:33.926 --> 02:49:34.206]  It just...
[02:49:35.339 --> 02:49:46.490]  You know, and so then, this is why Pam Geller is under attack, because she quotes the Quran here, and says, look, this is why they behave the way they behave, and this is why they treat women like slaves.
[02:49:47.031 --> 02:49:48.412]  It's all in their religious document.
[02:49:49.673 --> 02:49:52.116]  And she just, you know, cites it and everything.
[02:49:53.858 --> 02:49:54.418]  And you know what?
[02:49:54.979 --> 02:49:55.860]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:49:57.601 --> 02:49:57.721]  But...
[02:49:58.564 --> 02:50:11.752]  You don't have an average Jewish person or groups of Jewish people going out on the streets and gang raping people and setting off suitcase bombs and backpack bombs in the name of Judaism.
[02:50:12.012 --> 02:50:21.698]  You don't have Catholics going around gang raping people, going city to city, gang raping people, terrorizing people, forcing women into wearing certain clothes.
[02:50:22.358 --> 02:50:23.739]  You don't have Hindu people doing it.
[02:50:23.759 --> 02:50:24.539]  You don't have Buddha people.
[02:50:24.679 --> 02:50:25.820]  There's only... I'm sorry.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:31.603]  There's only one religion I can see right now that is behaving this way, and that's radical Islam.
[02:50:32.943 --> 02:50:36.025]  No, I'm not saying that all people that are Muslim are bad.
[02:50:36.345 --> 02:50:38.326]  I'm just pointing out the facts.
[02:50:41.328 --> 02:50:43.269]  And that's why you have what's happening in Sweden.
[02:50:43.569 --> 02:50:46.511]  That's why you have what's happening in Paris, in Germany.
[02:50:47.271 --> 02:50:54.335]  All of these cities, where the open borders are being poured in with radical Islamists, and now you have no go zones.
[02:50:54.435 --> 02:50:58.657]  You can't even go into these places in Sweden if you're Swedish.
[02:50:58.998 --> 02:51:00.718]  So yeah, you've lost your country.
[02:51:02.439 --> 02:51:04.260]  Oh yeah, Tommy Robinson deals with this.
[02:51:05.341 --> 02:51:07.382]  Same with the, what is the name of that group?
[02:51:07.462 --> 02:51:08.142]  Britain First?
[02:51:09.343 --> 02:51:10.844]  Paul Goulding and Jada Franzen?
[02:51:13.737 --> 02:51:14.518]  What is this, guys?
[02:51:15.679 --> 02:51:16.039]  You know what?
[02:51:17.381 --> 02:51:18.181]  This is breaking news.
[02:51:18.261 --> 02:51:21.124]  Britain's first leader and deputy leader jailed for hate crimes.
[02:51:21.264 --> 02:51:21.725]  Oh my gosh.
[02:51:21.745 --> 02:51:22.546]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:51:22.626 --> 02:51:22.826]  See?
[02:51:23.106 --> 02:51:23.266]  See?
[02:51:23.286 --> 02:51:24.848]  Oh boy.
[02:51:30.928 --> 02:51:44.332]  On New Year's Eve, two years ago, you had packs, packs, herds of Islamic Middle Eastern men running around raping women savagely in the street.
[02:51:45.732 --> 02:51:46.773]  But that's not a hate crime.
[02:51:48.153 --> 02:51:49.493]  I just had the story of Pamela Geller.
[02:51:49.674 --> 02:51:51.354]  I mean, so it's not a hate crime.
[02:51:51.374 --> 02:51:54.515]  I can't, I'm, I mean.
[02:51:57.432 --> 02:51:58.953]  Because I can't even wrap my head around this.
[02:51:59.853 --> 02:52:01.915]  It's not a hate crime if you're a Muslim.
[02:52:02.835 --> 02:52:04.476]  But it's a hate crime if it's against Muslims.
[02:52:08.438 --> 02:52:10.740]  I just, I can't even, I can't even deal with this.
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:17.283]  It's so nonsensical, it's so out of control, I just have to just walk away because it's like, just utter madness.
[02:52:17.724 --> 02:52:18.824]  Just utter madness.
[02:52:18.844 --> 02:52:19.505]  You know what I say?
[02:52:21.106 --> 02:52:26.349]  Women, women of Islam, free yourselves, remove your hijab.
[02:52:27.270 --> 02:52:29.572]  Oh, that's right, they can't because they'll get beaten and raped.
[02:52:29.632 --> 02:52:32.394]  Sorry, I forgot, but we're the intolerant ones in America.
[02:52:36.057 --> 02:52:38.419]  I'm not laughing at that, I'm laughing at this next story I'm covering.
[02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:43.023]  Blocked by Trump on Twitter, now crusaders take their case to court.
[02:52:43.123 --> 02:52:51.710]  Folks, all these snowflake liberals get blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter are now suing because they're so triggered that Trump blocked them.
[02:52:55.432 --> 02:53:08.787]  So, so Twitter can censor conservatives, social media can ban conservatives, block conservatives, that's all fine, that's all good, that's all heroic, but if Trump dares block a liberal on Twitter, he gets sued.
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:12.761]  These people are such children.
[02:53:14.002 --> 02:53:18.685]  Cosby lawyers say the Me Too moment makes a fair trial difficult.
[02:53:18.725 --> 02:53:30.133]  Now, I'm not standing up for Bill Cosby here, however, you have to admit this is a very fair point because we've now entered a environment where all you have to do is accuse a man of sexual assault and he's guilty now.
[02:53:31.194 --> 02:53:37.939]  If you go on Twitter and accuse a man of sexual assault and then hashtag Me Too,
[02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:42.241]  No jury, no judge, no trial.
[02:53:42.741 --> 02:53:43.241]  He's guilty.
[02:53:44.201 --> 02:53:45.101]  And that's what you're seeing.
[02:53:45.161 --> 02:53:50.343]  And then a few individuals have decided to fight back, like Steve Wynn and Ryan Seacrest, and then they're the bad guy.
[02:53:51.763 --> 02:53:54.464]  Meanwhile, Hollywood abuses women for decades.
[02:53:54.604 --> 02:53:55.784]  Nobody says, oh, peep.
[02:53:56.624 --> 02:54:01.186]  But now we bring back the Me Too movement because we want to make men look bad and we want to make Trump look bad.
[02:54:01.586 --> 02:54:02.026]  But now,
[02:54:04.022 --> 02:54:08.425]  I mean, again, I'm not standing up for Cosby here, but this is a fair point.
[02:54:08.866 --> 02:54:15.211]  The MeToo movement has made it probably impossible to have an impartial jury on a case like Bill Cosby's.
[02:54:17.192 --> 02:54:17.833]  That's what they've done.
[02:54:18.173 --> 02:54:21.435]  Like the French Revolution, all you have to do is accuse someone now, and they're guilty.
[02:54:21.736 --> 02:54:22.997]  This is the attack on men.
[02:54:23.277 --> 02:54:25.318]  This is the attack on the judicial system.
[02:54:26.259 --> 02:54:27.200]  This is the attack on Trump.
[02:54:28.129 --> 02:54:31.551]  Newsweek announces strategic structural changes amid turmoil.
[02:54:31.631 --> 02:54:32.951]  Yeah, Newsweek gets caught.
[02:54:33.531 --> 02:54:37.353]  Now they've got these suits against them for ad fraud.
[02:54:38.193 --> 02:54:44.536]  So Newsweek gets caught and now they have to undergo strategic structural changes.
[02:54:44.576 --> 02:54:49.898]  Yeah, the strategy is probably, you know, to do something about the cases of ad fraud that you're dealing with.
[02:54:50.639 --> 02:54:54.180]  But fake Newsweek is just another failing liberal news publication.
[02:54:55.161 --> 02:54:55.821]  Have you heard this one?
[02:54:57.196 --> 02:55:03.579]  Amazon Echo is apparently going crazy now and it's got like a Hillary Cackle laugh.
[02:55:04.059 --> 02:55:07.540]  It's just magically laughing like a Hillary Cackle.
[02:55:09.081 --> 02:55:10.721]  There's a good chance I get murdered tonight.
[02:55:10.781 --> 02:55:17.904]  Terrified Amazon Echo users reveal Alexa has been emitting bone-chilling laughs at random and is ignoring their commands.
[02:55:18.685 --> 02:55:24.407]  Amazon Alexa is going rogue and channeling its inner Hillary Clinton with a demon laugh.
[02:55:25.967 --> 02:55:27.148]  What the heck is that about?
[02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:30.231]  Seriously, is that the AI going rogue?
[02:55:30.251 --> 02:55:30.792]  What's going on?
[02:55:31.853 --> 02:55:33.855]  Kid Daniels has the story on Infowars.com.
[02:55:34.275 --> 02:55:46.468]  Facebook patents Roman reconnaissance robot, so it's going to just roam around, spy on you, gather a bunch of intel, record you, film you, take pictures of you, maybe give you a little TSA probe.
[02:55:48.029 --> 02:55:49.211]  So that's trendy, that's cool.
[02:55:50.359 --> 02:55:53.161]  It's your new Facebook imperial probe droid.
[02:55:53.942 --> 02:55:54.862]  Now here's what's going to happen.
[02:55:55.143 --> 02:55:56.463]  This thing is such a joke.
[02:55:57.104 --> 02:56:02.828]  If it gets put at the office, you're going to start bullying it, making fun of it, and then they'll say you're bullying a robot.
[02:56:03.909 --> 02:56:04.649]  You wait for that.
[02:56:06.231 --> 02:56:07.451]  Did you know about this?
[02:56:07.672 --> 02:56:13.416]  BlackBerry accuses Facebook of patent infringement, seeks injunction that could shut it down.
[02:56:14.176 --> 02:56:15.777]  Shut it down!
[02:56:17.163 --> 02:56:19.144]  I hate Facebook.
[02:56:19.284 --> 02:56:20.865]  I hate what it's done to our culture.
[02:56:21.005 --> 02:56:22.386]  I hate what it's done to our youth.
[02:56:22.767 --> 02:56:24.588]  I hate what it's done to our attention span.
[02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:28.590]  I hate what it's done to free speech.
[02:56:30.451 --> 02:56:38.096]  And I wish BlackBerry Godspeed in their injunction against Facebook.
[02:56:39.517 --> 02:56:41.258]  Because this is what's next.
[02:56:42.543 --> 02:56:44.905]  This story was from The Sun, and you already know about this.
[02:56:44.965 --> 02:56:46.766]  InfoWars has reported on this for a long time.
[02:56:47.287 --> 02:56:57.795]  Inside China's creepy social credit system that analyzes internet shopping and social media use in order to blacklist lazy or wasteful citizens and allow those who behave well to borrow money.
[02:56:58.075 --> 02:57:04.660]  But the next threat of this is that you're not even going to be allowed to do anything until you're on the social media.
[02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:07.802]  You won't be able to get credit or get anything because they'll look for you on social media.
[02:57:07.822 --> 02:57:09.064]  They'll be like, where are you?
[02:57:09.104 --> 02:57:10.305]  You're not on the Facebook?
[02:57:10.565 --> 02:57:12.326]  You're not on the social media?
[02:57:12.747 --> 02:57:16.850]  It'll be like idiocracy where the guy doesn't have the number tattooed on his wrist.
[02:57:17.271 --> 02:57:18.071]  And you're like, what's your name?
[02:57:18.091 --> 02:57:18.852]  He's like, well, I'm not sure.
[02:57:18.872 --> 02:57:19.893]  You're like, not sure.
[02:57:20.413 --> 02:57:21.194]  That's what it's going to be like.
[02:57:21.254 --> 02:57:21.394]  What?
[02:57:21.434 --> 02:57:23.156]  You're not on the social media system?
[02:57:23.536 --> 02:57:24.597]  Whoa, whoa.
[02:57:24.637 --> 02:57:25.698]  We don't know who you are.
[02:57:26.258 --> 02:57:27.820]  We don't know if you're a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:29.181]  You're not on the social media system.
[02:57:29.201 --> 02:57:30.382]  You don't have a social media score.
[02:57:30.422 --> 02:57:31.583]  We can't do business with you.
[02:57:31.643 --> 02:57:31.783]  Nope.
[02:57:31.943 --> 02:57:32.584]  No, we can't do it.
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:34.301]  All right, folks.
[02:57:34.361 --> 02:57:36.543]  Roger Stone is going to take over in the fourth hour.
[02:57:36.904 --> 02:57:39.547]  Remember, we need your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:39.627 --> 02:57:41.429]  Mass specials going on right now.
[02:57:41.549 --> 02:57:42.430]  Huge discounts.
[02:57:42.450 --> 02:57:45.514]  50% off a ton of items, up to 80% off on some items.
[02:57:45.834 --> 02:57:48.377]  Free shipping storewide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:48.778 --> 02:57:50.160]  Roger Stone takes over.
[02:57:54.122 --> 02:57:58.563]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:57:58.783 --> 02:58:03.465]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:58:04.085 --> 02:58:09.926]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:58:10.346 --> 02:58:22.930]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, see, I can absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:58:23.710 --> 02:58:32.353]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:58:32.373 --> 02:58:34.294]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:58:34.634 --> 02:58:35.734]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:58:35.754 --> 02:58:37.054]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:58:37.235 --> 02:58:38.435]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:58:38.635 --> 02:58:40.115]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:58:40.616 --> 02:58:42.236]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:58:42.256 --> 02:58:44.037]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:58:44.397 --> 02:58:46.998]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:58:47.038 --> 02:58:47.898]  This is insane.
[02:58:48.298 --> 02:58:49.919]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:58:50.179 --> 02:58:52.739]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:58:53.180 --> 02:58:54.700]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:58:54.740 --> 02:58:56.561]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:58:56.581 --> 02:58:58.441]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:58:59.302 --> 02:59:05.243]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:59:05.483 --> 02:59:06.824]  All just moderate dose.
[02:59:08.356 --> 02:59:16.340]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:18.762]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:18.802 --> 02:59:19.942]  But thank you for committing.
[02:59:23.991 --> 02:59:26.834]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:59:27.214 --> 02:59:29.817]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:59:29.837 --> 02:59:34.602]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:59:35.062 --> 02:59:41.209]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:44.352]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:59:44.692 --> 02:59:45.994]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:59:54.747 --> 02:59:58.848]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.349 --> 03:00:00.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.972 --> 03:00:11.913]  You found it.
[03:00:12.213 --> 03:00:13.733]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:14.253 --> 03:00:18.515]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:00:22.264 --> 03:00:27.807]  All right, Roger Stone is about to take over here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:28.468 --> 03:00:35.952]  And then he will carry over his coverage to the War Room, which always runs after the Alex Jones Show from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:36.592 --> 03:00:37.032]  Central.
[03:00:37.253 --> 03:00:42.896]  Of course, just like the Alex Jones Channel, the War Room is under total attack and censorship from YouTube.
[03:00:43.516 --> 03:00:52.321]  And Roger will have that, as well as some of the other big stories, I'm sure, some of the White House intrigue that is developing, and he's going to be joined by Jacob Angles as well.
[03:00:53.601 --> 03:01:12.751]  But again, just to highlight some of the stuff that is big news today, Trump DOJ sues California over interference with immigration enforcement, and Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, ought to be arrested and thrown in jail for aiding and abetting criminals.
[03:01:14.042 --> 03:01:26.568]  You've got police detain a teen in Utah who tried to detonate a homemade explosive device at Pineview High School and says he was inspired by ISIS.
[03:01:27.648 --> 03:01:33.010]  Spray-painted, ISIS is coming on the walls of the school.
[03:01:33.811 --> 03:01:34.811]  So you've got that.
[03:01:35.311 --> 03:01:36.952]  Again, we covered all the breaking news.
[03:01:37.092 --> 03:01:41.074]  There's new proposed legislation in Florida
[03:01:42.623 --> 03:01:57.076]  And, you know, they put a mask over it, and the big thing that they're going to say is, to try to sell this deal, $400 million for mental health facilities, or for whatever it is, and who knows where that money will actually be allocated.
[03:01:57.136 --> 03:01:59.017]  I'll be honest with you, I don't know if I trust it, but...
[03:01:59.838 --> 03:02:01.098]  Well, I don't trust this legislation.
[03:02:01.118 --> 03:02:12.281]  I wouldn't vote for this legislation because what they're hiding here is they say they want to ban bump stocks, but then they put the phrasing in the legislation to say anything that will increase the rate of fire.
[03:02:12.742 --> 03:02:14.982]  Well, that is intentionally ambiguous.
[03:02:15.222 --> 03:02:16.983]  So they're going to say you can't change your trigger.
[03:02:17.303 --> 03:02:18.363]  You can't have a grip.
[03:02:18.623 --> 03:02:19.704]  You can't have a scope.
[03:02:20.044 --> 03:02:23.905]  You can't have whatever it is because it increases the rate of fire.
[03:02:23.945 --> 03:02:25.005]  You see how they do that?
[03:02:25.485 --> 03:02:27.366]  It also proposes raging the age of 18 to 21.
[03:02:29.534 --> 03:02:32.857]  And this is totally war-gamed out by the Democrats, folks.
[03:02:33.377 --> 03:02:38.181]  They do this on the heels of the Florida shooting, while they can tug at the heartstrings.
[03:02:38.501 --> 03:02:41.883]  They say this will put armed security on campus and increase mental health.
[03:02:42.064 --> 03:02:43.024]  That's how they'll sell it.
[03:02:43.405 --> 03:02:57.996]  And they won't even report how you have to be 21 to get a gun now, and you have to have a three-day waiting period to get a gun now, and you can't do anything that increases the rate of fire, which they'll say eventually is a scope, a grip, a trigger, a bump stock, whatever.
[03:03:00.702 --> 03:03:05.964]  I mean, you know, there's all different types of attachments that you can put on a weapon that they'll say is increasing the rate of fire.
[03:03:06.024 --> 03:03:13.706]  So now, that will be setting a precedent for the rest of the nation you watch.
[03:03:17.207 --> 03:03:20.488]  So we'll just have to see how that goes.
[03:03:20.528 --> 03:03:23.769]  I mean, we got through stacks of news today.
[03:03:24.569 --> 03:03:25.029]  You've got
[03:03:26.127 --> 03:03:39.778]  The left, the tolerant left on college campuses, saying that any conservative speech now has to be banned, any conservative group on campus has to be shut down because it's quote-unquote hate speech.
[03:03:41.420 --> 03:03:44.062]  They say we're like Nazis.
[03:03:45.283 --> 03:03:47.985]  They accuse Trump of being an authoritarian dictator.
[03:03:48.065 --> 03:03:49.226]  They say that we're the Nazis.
[03:03:49.547 --> 03:03:53.150]  And then everything they do is actually a Nazi tactic.
[03:03:54.352 --> 03:03:58.755]  They get funding from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[03:04:00.977 --> 03:04:01.977]  Then what do the Nazis do?
[03:04:02.037 --> 03:04:04.239]  They shut down all their political opposition.
[03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:05.700]  Free speech.
[03:04:06.701 --> 03:04:14.686]  They engaged in false flags to blame on their opposition and then give themselves more power.
[03:04:16.267 --> 03:04:22.632]  If the Nazis were here today, on college campuses, what would they be doing?
[03:04:23.783 --> 03:04:25.244]  They'd be shutting down free speech.
[03:04:25.304 --> 03:04:26.745]  They'd be shutting down their opposition.
[03:04:26.765 --> 03:04:28.747]  They'd be violently attacking their opposition.
[03:04:29.087 --> 03:04:36.412]  Anytime the opposition came out to shoot a video or a report, they'd be there, bullying them, attacking them, shoving a sign in their face.
[03:04:37.213 --> 03:04:38.834]  And that's what the political left is doing.
[03:04:42.947 --> 03:04:47.632]  Go down the same road that the average liberal does and just say, you're a Nazi!
[03:04:47.873 --> 03:04:48.473]  You're a bigot!
[03:04:48.513 --> 03:04:49.254]  You're a racist!
[03:04:49.314 --> 03:04:50.195]  Because they are!
[03:04:50.215 --> 03:05:00.767]  Or do we try to take the high ground and say, hey look, let's have a debate over idea and policy, only to realize they can't have that debate, they don't have the intellect, they don't have the information.
[03:05:03.032 --> 03:05:07.754]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.

[03:06:15.423 --> 03:06:23.588]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.770 --> 03:06:31.512]  United States of America is back, and that's why the Democrats and the left are freaking out.
[03:06:32.973 --> 03:06:33.993]  They cannot stand that.
[03:06:34.033 --> 03:06:40.316]  They were out to destroy this country, and they were one president away from doing just that, Hillary Clinton.
[03:06:41.897 --> 03:06:51.001]  I'm sitting in here on the break as we're getting Roger Stone on, and I'm thinking, you've covered all the news, you've covered the daily topics, where do you really go from here?
[03:06:51.021 --> 03:06:51.801]  Because none of it makes sense.
[03:06:52.181 --> 03:06:54.262]  And it hits me like a ton of bricks.
[03:06:57.493 --> 03:07:05.659]  The biggest story when it comes to the political front and the political battlefield is the same story.
[03:07:05.779 --> 03:07:07.080]  It's the elephant in the room.
[03:07:08.321 --> 03:07:11.183]  It is the 1984 mentality.
[03:07:11.863 --> 03:07:13.785]  Okay, look at everything we're dealing with.
[03:07:15.266 --> 03:07:22.111]  The political left, and I'm just, this is, this is what has now happened
[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:26.243]  Where the fault line has now been drawn between the political left and the political right.
[03:07:26.323 --> 03:07:28.345]  It used to be you had all different spheres.
[03:07:28.745 --> 03:07:32.869]  Because now what's happened is the left has gone so far to the left.
[03:07:32.969 --> 03:07:34.750]  The left has gone so radical.
[03:07:34.971 --> 03:07:38.233]  The left has gone so violent, so hateful, so disgusting.
[03:07:39.443 --> 03:07:49.345]  So self-deprecating that the average leftist that was really just a centrist is now going to the right because there's nowhere else to go.
[03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:52.026]  They cannot, nothing from the left resonates with them.
[03:07:52.386 --> 03:07:55.807]  Hating and bashing Trump all day long doesn't do it for them.
[03:07:56.387 --> 03:08:01.488]  So they're looking for anything but all that's left now is the political right because it's become that much of a fault line.
[03:08:02.669 --> 03:08:08.010]  But then you realize, okay, so you've got the fault line and you've got the radical political left and then everyone else.
[03:08:09.844 --> 03:08:11.005]  But it's called the political right.
[03:08:11.345 --> 03:08:13.227]  So the radical left says what?
[03:08:13.607 --> 03:08:15.668]  Well, the political right engages in fake news.
[03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:18.230]  That's what they do all day long.
[03:08:18.471 --> 03:08:20.372]  Look at the Trump-Russia collusion theory.
[03:08:20.712 --> 03:08:21.273]  Nothing there.
[03:08:22.657 --> 03:08:25.659]  The radical left says that Trump colluded with Russia.
[03:08:26.139 --> 03:08:29.922]  Well, you look into it, it was actually Hillary Clinton that colluded with Russia.
[03:08:30.362 --> 03:08:39.809]  It was a fake dossier with Russian sources paid for opposition research by Hillary Clinton that was then used to illegally spy on President Trump.
[03:08:39.829 --> 03:08:43.491]  So, the left is the one that colluded with Russia.
[03:08:43.952 --> 03:08:44.272]  Again.
[03:08:45.012 --> 03:08:45.593]  So they say
[03:08:47.051 --> 03:08:48.012]  We are violent.
[03:08:48.092 --> 03:08:51.294]  The political radical left says the right is violent, they're intolerant.
[03:08:51.415 --> 03:09:00.782]  Meanwhile, they're so violent and intolerant, if you just go out in the streets with a Trump hat on, they can't tolerate that, so they get violent with you.
[03:09:01.883 --> 03:09:09.989]  Or an InfoWars reporter goes on to a UT campus and just has an InfoWars mic flag, just interviewing people, and radical leftists show up and have to shut it down.
[03:09:11.771 --> 03:09:14.553]  And that's when you realize it, and this is the trick.
[03:09:16.604 --> 03:09:22.488]  It's so simple, it's so simple that it's almost impossible to comprehend.
[03:09:24.009 --> 03:09:25.670]  And it's all out of Saul Alinsky's handbook.
[03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:37.977]  Everything that the political left right now, everything, literally, everything that comes out of the Democrat Party, everything that comes out of the radical left, they're guilty of.
[03:09:39.898 --> 03:09:45.322]  Either these people are such criminals at the top, the Clintons, the Obamas, the Schumers, the Pelosi's,
[03:09:46.604 --> 03:09:56.474]  That they have to point in the mirror, except pretend they're pointing at their political opposition and say everything they're guilty of, even though they know they're looking right in the mirror.
[03:09:58.339 --> 03:10:00.221]  So then their street urchins do the same thing.
[03:10:00.941 --> 03:10:02.663]  You're acting like a Nazi!
[03:10:03.243 --> 03:10:08.008]  As they go out and chant and riot and protest and beat up the political opposition.
[03:10:08.548 --> 03:10:11.351]  Burn cities to the ground like they did in Berkeley.
[03:10:11.451 --> 03:10:13.373]  Just burn everything, topple everything.
[03:10:13.393 --> 03:10:17.196]  You know, they do it in Berkeley, they do it in St.
[03:10:17.256 --> 03:10:22.120]  Louis, in Ferguson, they do it in Baltimore, they do it in...
[03:10:24.028 --> 03:10:24.908]  Where was the other one?
[03:10:25.729 --> 03:10:26.649]  I can't even think of it now.
[03:10:26.909 --> 03:10:28.290]  But that's what they do!
[03:10:29.671 --> 03:10:35.534]  And then they say, we're violent, we're the Nazis, we're intolerant, we're against free speech.
[03:10:38.875 --> 03:10:39.916]  And this is what we deal with.
[03:10:42.477 --> 03:10:45.319]  So now, in Seattle,
[03:10:46.357 --> 03:10:47.657]  They're trying to set a precedent.
[03:10:47.837 --> 03:10:56.380]  If somebody sees you with a gun and gets triggered because you have a gun, and then they call it in to police, and the police determine that you have a mental problem, well then they're just going to take your gun.
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:11:06.423]  Now in Seattle, because homelessness isn't enough of an issue in Seattle, no it's a huge issue, now the homeless just got even more empowered by a liberal judge.
[03:11:07.503 --> 03:11:10.304]  A homeless man had his truck illegally parked for 72 hours.
[03:11:11.792 --> 03:11:13.094]  His truck was then impounded.
[03:11:13.815 --> 03:11:18.221]  And you know he's getting help from the ACLU or some legal defense fund here.
[03:11:18.702 --> 03:11:20.384]  A homeless man can't afford an attorney, right?
[03:11:21.526 --> 03:11:22.347]  Maybe he can, I don't know.
[03:11:23.489 --> 03:11:24.610]  And so, Suze...
[03:11:25.899 --> 03:11:30.521]  Because his truck gets impounded, and the judge says, you cannot impound this man's truck, it's his home.
[03:11:30.801 --> 03:11:43.846]  So now, the homeless man is so empowered, he runs the city now, he can park his truck wherever the heck he wants, and it can't be impounded, because it's considered his home, says a Seattle judge.
[03:11:44.386 --> 03:11:48.647]  So this is what they do in California, this is what they do in liberal cities, the most
[03:11:50.845 --> 03:11:55.009]  Vile, slovenly bums run the city.
[03:11:55.309 --> 03:12:07.660]  The hard-working, average American that goes to work, punches it in, works hard, pays their rent, pays their taxes, busts their butt to try to have a career, you don't get jack!
[03:12:08.401 --> 03:12:09.562]  You are scum!
[03:12:10.423 --> 03:12:12.985]  You have to pay for all of the non-citizens.
[03:12:13.305 --> 03:12:15.487]  You have to pay for all the homeless bums.
[03:12:15.968 --> 03:12:16.868]  That's why you work.
[03:12:17.549 --> 03:12:21.785]  See, if you live in California, and now they're trying to do it in Texas, if you live in California...
[03:12:22.947 --> 03:12:24.648]  You don't work to build a family.
[03:12:24.688 --> 03:12:25.869]  You don't work to build a career.
[03:12:26.169 --> 03:12:27.730]  Obama says you didn't even do that yourself.
[03:12:27.770 --> 03:12:28.491]  Someone else did that.
[03:12:28.871 --> 03:12:32.073]  You're not working to establish some financial security.
[03:12:32.394 --> 03:12:40.039]  You're not working so that you can have a home and have a family and have a future that you can then bestow to your lineage.
[03:12:40.339 --> 03:12:40.860]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:49.446]  In California, you're working so that all of the illegal citizens can come into California and live rent-free and live without being
[03:12:50.006 --> 03:12:51.127]  Penalized for breaking the law.
[03:12:51.507 --> 03:12:59.972]  You're working your butt off so that every homeless person can run the city, take a dump in the streets, shoot up with heroin down the road, and then run the city.
[03:13:00.592 --> 03:13:03.674]  That's what you do now in California.
[03:13:05.815 --> 03:13:06.356]  And it's sick.
[03:13:08.857 --> 03:13:11.579]  And this brings us to the midterm elections, folks.
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:16.982]  Now, I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:13:17.022 --> 03:13:18.403]  You're seeing conflicting reports.
[03:13:21.027 --> 03:13:28.854]  If you believed the media during the entire 2016 presidential campaign, of course, you would have been totally bamboozled.
[03:13:29.074 --> 03:13:29.614]  And they were!
[03:13:29.995 --> 03:13:36.360]  And that's why you got all these video clips, all these compilations of liberal media just totally bamboozled at the results.
[03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:36.940]  Like, what?
[03:13:37.301 --> 03:13:38.662]  We reported the exact opposite!
[03:13:38.702 --> 03:13:39.422]  How did this come true?
[03:13:39.983 --> 03:13:45.007]  So now you're seeing all the reports, Texas may turn blue, Democrats having huge turnout, all this.
[03:13:45.207 --> 03:13:46.969]  So they're building up this narrative.
[03:13:48.086 --> 03:13:49.427]  Democrats are going to be victorious.
[03:13:49.507 --> 03:13:50.787]  Democrats are coming for the House.
[03:13:50.907 --> 03:13:52.208]  Democrats are coming for the Senate.
[03:13:52.308 --> 03:13:53.448]  Democrats are taking over.
[03:13:53.768 --> 03:13:54.769]  Everyone's voting Democrat.
[03:13:55.869 --> 03:13:57.810]  Is this another fake news build-up?
[03:13:57.930 --> 03:14:04.733]  Is this another fake news story that they're trying to push on the American people that's going to be totally proven wrong?
[03:14:06.854 --> 03:14:07.594]  I really don't know.
[03:14:09.275 --> 03:14:10.575]  I think it's hard to say at this point.
[03:14:11.576 --> 03:14:12.476]  But I will tell you this.
[03:14:15.330 --> 03:14:31.633]  In these midterm elections, if we don't do what we can to get a Congress that will get behind President Trump, get behind the Make America Great Again agenda, just get behind basic law and order, then we actually have a chance to save this country.
[03:14:32.773 --> 03:14:42.015]  But if the Democrats really do win Congress in the midterms and they get more radical liberals in there, they get more Trump haters in there, they get more open borders, they get more criminals in there,
[03:14:43.679 --> 03:14:44.259]  I just don't know.
[03:14:44.279 --> 03:14:46.000]  I don't know how we come back from this.
[03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:50.340]  I don't know how much more you can take the liberal nonsense, folks.
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:55.041]  I mean, the state of California, you know, how can it survive?
[03:14:56.422 --> 03:14:57.282]  How can they survive?
[03:14:58.022 --> 03:14:58.642]  They can't survive.
[03:14:58.682 --> 03:14:59.702]  How can America survive?
[03:15:00.402 --> 03:15:01.223]  It won't survive.
[03:15:01.323 --> 03:15:06.364]  Democrats will destroy this country, just like they destroy every city that they get elected in.
[03:15:06.404 --> 03:15:07.564]  Now, I'm about to hand the
[03:15:09.093 --> 03:15:11.095]  The rain's over to Roger Stone here.
[03:15:11.115 --> 03:15:14.818]  Before I do, I have to remind you about the big specials at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:15:15.199 --> 03:15:16.200]  They're coming after us.
[03:15:16.220 --> 03:15:18.962]  They're trying to ban us on social media, block us on Twitter.
[03:15:19.002 --> 03:15:20.704]  They create fake news about us all day.
[03:15:20.724 --> 03:15:21.464]  We're under attack.
[03:15:22.545 --> 03:15:32.355]  But with your support at InfoWarStore.com, not only are we able to shield ourselves and resiliently still come on air after the attacks, we're also able to grow.

[03:15:43.426 --> 03:15:49.827]  They hate free speech, they hate that this broadcast destroys their narrative, so they want to try to shut it down.
[03:15:50.207 --> 03:15:52.288]  So fund us, and we will continue to grow.
[03:15:52.608 --> 03:15:56.429]  Free shipping store-wide, massive specials at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:56.869 --> 03:15:58.329]  Roger Stone takes over on the other side.
[03:16:02.042 --> 03:16:06.745]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[03:16:07.026 --> 03:16:12.569]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[03:16:12.669 --> 03:16:17.893]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.
[03:16:17.953 --> 03:16:21.696]  We're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[03:16:21.876 --> 03:16:29.701]  So go to fortifiedsupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[03:16:29.802 --> 03:16:31.423]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[03:16:31.983 --> 03:16:33.944]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:16:33.964 --> 03:16:34.384]  Go ahead.
[03:16:34.664 --> 03:16:36.865]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:16:36.885 --> 03:16:39.967]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:16:40.747 --> 03:16:41.848]  It just gets old, man.
[03:16:42.188 --> 03:16:43.888]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:16:44.589 --> 03:16:46.690]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:16:46.930 --> 03:16:50.912]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:16:50.932 --> 03:16:53.373]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:16:54.233 --> 03:16:56.554]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:16:56.914 --> 03:16:57.995]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:16:58.275 --> 03:16:59.155]  Us being shut down?
[03:16:59.395 --> 03:17:00.456]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:17:00.856 --> 03:17:01.896]  You know what, Alex?
[03:17:01.936 --> 03:17:03.017]  Put him on pause again.
[03:17:03.037 --> 03:17:03.877]  Hey, Frank!
[03:17:04.157 --> 03:17:09.499]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:17:09.799 --> 03:17:14.081]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:17:14.321 --> 03:17:17.202]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:17:17.462 --> 03:17:17.843]  You understand?
[03:17:17.923 --> 03:17:19.203]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:17:19.563 --> 03:17:20.684]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:17:21.684 --> 03:17:26.450]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:17:36.581 --> 03:17:37.601]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[03:17:37.821 --> 03:17:41.262]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[03:17:41.482 --> 03:17:42.902]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[03:17:42.922 --> 03:17:43.743]  They're suing me.
[03:17:43.983 --> 03:17:45.183]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[03:17:45.643 --> 03:17:47.443]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[03:17:47.483 --> 03:17:48.844]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[03:17:49.104 --> 03:17:50.084]  It cost a lot to run this.
[03:17:50.264 --> 03:17:52.144]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[03:17:52.384 --> 03:17:53.865]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[03:17:53.905 --> 03:17:57.105]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[03:17:57.405 --> 03:17:58.946]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[03:17:58.986 --> 03:17:59.546]  Tell him right there.
[03:17:59.586 --> 03:17:59.826]  Frank!
[03:18:00.126 --> 03:18:00.686]  Hey, Frank!
[03:18:00.946 --> 03:18:02.187]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[03:18:02.607 --> 03:18:18.692]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention, although of course everybody likes a little bit of attention, it's nice, but I can't do TV and I can't do radio and I can't publish books and I can't sell anything and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[03:18:18.813 --> 03:18:21.553]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[03:18:21.593 --> 03:18:25.455]  So it's not bragging, it's a daily reality and that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and
[03:18:26.115 --> 03:18:28.276]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[03:18:28.296 --> 03:18:28.816]  We're doing it now.
[03:18:28.916 --> 03:18:30.016]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:30.076 --> 03:18:30.816]  Go get a t-shirt.
[03:18:30.856 --> 03:18:31.196]  Get a book.

[03:18:32.397 --> 03:18:35.538]  Get an additional 10% off on any of these things.
[03:18:35.558 --> 03:18:38.959]  That makes a lot of them loss of liters, and then that way, each month, it reships to you.

[03:18:44.140 --> 03:18:47.562]  Listen, everybody wants somebody to fight?
[03:18:48.122 --> 03:18:48.742]  We're fighting!
[03:18:49.002 --> 03:18:50.323]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[03:18:50.403 --> 03:18:54.645]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[03:18:54.965 --> 03:18:58.467]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[03:18:58.487 --> 03:18:59.247]  Do you understand?
[03:18:59.267 --> 03:19:00.468]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:19:02.096 --> 03:19:03.697]  You think our information's hardcore?
[03:19:04.077 --> 03:19:05.318]  You think our focus is brutal?

[03:19:58.042 --> 03:20:00.663]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:20:06.733 --> 03:20:09.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.765 --> 03:20:22.668]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:20:23.129 --> 03:20:27.052]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:27.633 --> 03:20:30.876]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:34.392 --> 03:20:35.173]  Welcome back.
[03:20:35.793 --> 03:20:42.498]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:43.699 --> 03:21:02.534]  Well, for those of you who may think that we're crying wolf when we talk about Internet censorship and the wide, whole-scale effort by the tech left and the giants of Silicon Valley to shut us down, think again.
[03:21:03.735 --> 03:21:08.778]  Yesterday, I noticed for the first time that Donald Trump Jr.
[03:21:09.138 --> 03:21:13.820]  and Matt Drudge and the Drudge Report are being censored.
[03:21:15.001 --> 03:21:23.666]  Links that they put up are blocked with a box that says this information has been blocked because it is potentially too sensitive.
[03:21:24.546 --> 03:21:25.247]  Says who?
[03:21:26.267 --> 03:21:36.034]  Snopes, a left-wing mom-and-pop shop that operates as the left-wing censors for Google and YouTube?
[03:21:37.295 --> 03:21:45.301]  There's a terrific piece in Breitbart yesterday which accuses the tech left of gangsterism.
[03:21:46.081 --> 03:21:58.067]  They correctly say you don't have to like Alex Jones to be concerned about the fact that they are attempting to censor Alex Jones and InfoWars on YouTube.
[03:21:58.807 --> 03:22:09.212]  Now this is kind of funny because yesterday when I appeared in a very contentious interview on MSNBC's Meet the Press,
[03:22:10.112 --> 03:22:21.638]  After my interview, one of the talking heads in some parallel universe that's hard to identify accused me of being a gangster.
[03:22:22.685 --> 03:22:23.646]  I'm not a gangster.
[03:22:23.966 --> 03:22:25.447]  I just dress like one.
[03:22:26.188 --> 03:22:34.714]  The real gangsters, however, are the folks at Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.
[03:22:35.375 --> 03:22:38.737]  They operate just like Al Capone.
[03:22:39.418 --> 03:22:42.140]  Hey, nice Twitter feed you've got there.
[03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:45.662]  Sure would be a shame if anything happened to it.
[03:22:46.443 --> 03:22:53.666]  What they want us to do is adhere to their worldview, to only say things that they approve.
[03:22:54.206 --> 03:22:57.747]  Well, that's not what InfoWars is all about.
[03:22:58.367 --> 03:23:08.671]  But for anyone who thinks that this is just the folks at InfoWars crying wolf to try to drive people to the InfoWars store, think again.
[03:23:09.671 --> 03:23:24.640]  The entire election and rise of Donald Trump would have been completely impossible without a vibrant and robust alternative media, without the rise of the forces of freedom on the Internet.
[03:23:25.301 --> 03:23:35.567]  And now, those who are still in shock over losing the 2016 election are now seeking to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[03:23:36.747 --> 03:23:38.249]  And they play games.
[03:23:39.149 --> 03:23:42.793]  InfoWars has one strike at YouTube's.
[03:23:43.393 --> 03:23:45.435]  InfoWars has two strikes.
[03:23:46.076 --> 03:23:47.677]  Oh, that strike is removed.
[03:23:48.078 --> 03:23:50.180]  Now that strike is restored.
[03:23:50.640 --> 03:23:52.242]  Now it's gone again.
[03:23:52.862 --> 03:24:00.264]  Kind of reminds me of when they said, oh, we knocked President Trump off of Twitter, but it was a mistake.
[03:24:00.304 --> 03:24:02.865]  He was only down for 11 minutes.
[03:24:03.165 --> 03:24:08.106]  Oh, we killed the Twitter feed of the journalist Julian Assange.
[03:24:08.366 --> 03:24:12.347]  Oh, we took Sean Hannity's Twitter feed down.
[03:24:12.787 --> 03:24:13.727]  It was a mistake.
[03:24:14.168 --> 03:24:17.808]  Somebody must have spilled Coca-Cola on the keyboard.
[03:24:18.589 --> 03:24:19.289]  Don't buy it.
[03:24:20.049 --> 03:24:24.250]  This is the most important fight of our time.
[03:24:25.110 --> 03:24:29.031]  Our prospects in 2018 and 2020 are nil.
[03:24:29.691 --> 03:24:33.772]  But do recognize that InfoWars is the test case.
[03:24:34.413 --> 03:24:37.893]  They are singling us out for execution first.
[03:24:38.033 --> 03:24:38.413]  Why?
[03:24:38.854 --> 03:24:41.154]  Because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:24:41.614 --> 03:24:48.496]  Because we are the most aggressive in exposing the foibles of the globalists.
[03:24:49.056 --> 03:24:56.479]  And the neocons and others who have brought this country to its knees over the last eight years.
[03:24:57.299 --> 03:24:58.840]  It's a test case, folks.
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:05.503]  If we can cut Alex Jones and the people at InfoWars off at the knees, who's next?
[03:25:06.403 --> 03:25:19.631]  As Mr. Nolte says, John Nolte at Breitbart, today it's Alex Jones, tomorrow it's Breitbart, the following day it's you.
[03:25:20.351 --> 03:25:23.373]  Make no mistake about their game plan.
[03:25:24.326 --> 03:25:25.947]  What can you do about it?
[03:25:26.027 --> 03:25:27.688]  Well, you can do several things.
[03:25:28.388 --> 03:25:46.897]  You can sign up at Gab and Minds and other social media platforms that don't censorship thought, that welcome anyone who wants to contribute and express and exercise their First Amendment rights.
[03:25:47.657 --> 03:25:55.561]  You can use Facebook, but recognize that they, too, are now moving aggressively towards censorship.
[03:25:56.142 --> 03:26:01.304]  What they call it is them deciding what news you should see.
[03:26:02.085 --> 03:26:09.129]  The most important thing, perhaps, you can do is to gird us for the extraordinary fight ahead.
[03:26:10.089 --> 03:26:21.813]  Alex Jones and I are working together with others to map out a multi-pronged strategy to confront and defeat this effort of censorship.
[03:26:22.453 --> 03:26:24.954]  But we cannot do it without money.
[03:26:25.854 --> 03:26:33.256]  We don't have wealthy benefactors who write multi-million dollar checks to InfoWars.
[03:26:33.956 --> 03:26:43.679]  We can depend only on you, your family, your friends, and your circle of patriots, your freedom-fighting associates.
[03:26:44.279 --> 03:26:52.702]  Please go now to the InfoWars store and recognize that Alex Jones stands behind all of these products.
[03:26:53.462 --> 03:27:08.110]  In every case, we are presenting deep discounts on some of our most popular items in an effort to get you to try them, because we're confident once you try them, you will be satisfied and you will order more.
[03:27:08.690 --> 03:27:25.999]  So whether it is biome defense at 50% off, whether it is super male vitality at 50% off, whether it is the entire range of super blue fluoride oral products, the toothpaste, the mouthwash, in two flavors,
[03:27:26.679 --> 03:27:29.820]  These are the very best of the best.
[03:27:30.380 --> 03:27:41.282]  And you can see online, in many cases, most cases, we have thousands and thousands of testimonials from satisfied InfoWarriors.
[03:27:41.942 --> 03:27:43.042]  So help yourself.
[03:27:43.782 --> 03:27:44.562]  Help us.
[03:27:45.202 --> 03:27:47.223]  Help the Movement for Freedom.
[03:27:47.743 --> 03:27:50.483]  Help preserve the First Amendment.
[03:27:50.924 --> 03:27:52.844]  Help us end this fight.
[03:27:53.504 --> 03:28:00.827]  Now, I have spoken at length about a couple of these products, but I'm going to touch on this one again.
[03:28:01.997 --> 03:28:09.619]  Great Whey Protein, which I use as a meal replacement, is hard to find when it's palatable.
[03:28:10.419 --> 03:28:13.760]  It's expensive, but it's very effective.
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:23.022]  I used to mix it with soy milk until Rob Dew got me hip to the downside of too much soy.
[03:28:23.862 --> 03:28:31.224]  This product is on special today, the Whey Protein, and I recommend it without reservation.
[03:28:34.147 --> 03:28:40.751]  The other personal favorite is of course the immune wall.
[03:28:41.032 --> 03:28:45.675]  In this particular atmosphere, the flu season, it's the best of the best.
[03:28:46.015 --> 03:28:50.178]  So load up on these products now and help us defeat the sensors.
[03:29:02.495 --> 03:29:03.855]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:04.136 --> 03:29:05.436]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.616 --> 03:29:06.516]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:06.816 --> 03:29:12.598]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:12.818 --> 03:29:18.540]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[03:29:38.473 --> 03:29:39.675]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:30:08.652 --> 03:30:10.713]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years.
[03:30:10.733 --> 03:30:11.994]  I knew his dad before I even knew him.
[03:30:12.014 --> 03:30:13.955]  Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[03:30:13.975 --> 03:30:16.917]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[03:30:17.297 --> 03:30:27.563]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas, and then of course the big films you produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it.
[03:30:28.143 --> 03:30:32.726]  Very successful, but now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde fitting back the state of the world.
[03:30:33.386 --> 03:30:39.708]  I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[03:30:40.048 --> 03:30:41.449]  The world has really changed.
[03:30:41.729 --> 03:30:45.430]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[03:30:46.170 --> 03:30:47.411]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[03:30:47.431 --> 03:30:49.972]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[03:30:50.332 --> 03:30:54.673]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[03:30:55.093 --> 03:30:56.814]  And I think the elites are going down.
[03:30:57.334 --> 03:31:00.155]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[03:31:00.255 --> 03:31:01.255]  I'm happy to be alive.
[03:31:01.316 --> 03:31:02.416]  I'm proud to witness it.
[03:31:03.815 --> 03:31:04.916]  Making America great again.
[03:31:05.216 --> 03:31:09.039]  You've made films about the globalists, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[03:31:10.580 --> 03:31:13.662]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[03:31:13.982 --> 03:31:14.862]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:31:14.902 --> 03:31:21.967]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did Amerigeddon, that was such a large film, it took a long time, big budget.
[03:31:22.347 --> 03:31:32.134]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story about what would the world look like if civil war actually took place,
[03:31:32.894 --> 03:31:38.801]  Everybody factioned up and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[03:31:39.221 --> 03:31:39.962]  That's already happened.
[03:31:40.423 --> 03:31:41.404]  It's starting.
[03:31:41.444 --> 03:31:49.353]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[03:31:50.033 --> 03:31:52.176]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[03:31:52.736 --> 03:31:55.880]  And the devil is after believers all over the country.
[03:31:56.000 --> 03:32:01.506]  And we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[03:32:01.807 --> 03:32:03.889]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[03:32:03.969 --> 03:32:08.034]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[03:32:08.314 --> 03:32:13.518]  And we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[03:32:14.298 --> 03:32:15.819]  This is really what they're pushing.
[03:32:15.859 --> 03:32:19.162]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[03:32:19.942 --> 03:32:25.306]  When you see them failing, though, on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[03:32:25.326 --> 03:32:26.707]  They're not going to give up.
[03:32:26.787 --> 03:32:28.709]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[03:32:28.729 --> 03:32:30.910]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.811]  They're not going to give up.
[03:32:32.411 --> 03:32:45.219]  Um, I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, um, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[03:32:45.579 --> 03:32:50.943]  So, a little curious to see what happens with them, but you know what?
[03:32:51.023 --> 03:32:53.444]  We're gonna kick their butts everywhere.
[03:32:53.845 --> 03:32:55.145]  We're gonna beat them, Alex.
[03:32:55.446 --> 03:32:57.507]  We are going to win this battle.
[03:33:06.224 --> 03:33:17.694]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.334 --> 03:33:27.922]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:28.483 --> 03:33:30.124]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:33.666 --> 03:33:36.589]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.849 --> 03:33:38.871]  I'm your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:39.911 --> 03:33:48.258]  One of the things that I have found transcends left and right is our love of man's best friend.
[03:33:48.598 --> 03:33:49.919]  Yes, our dogs.
[03:33:50.800 --> 03:33:57.485]  And we've talked here on the War Room and on the Alex Jones Show about the ongoing process
[03:33:58.386 --> 03:34:17.371]  In which the Veterans Administration, in the Trump administration, utilizes dogs, and in some cases puppies, as young as eight weeks, in barbaric medical experiments that I really question the value of.
[03:34:18.231 --> 03:34:22.954]  We have examples of dogs being given crystal meth.
[03:34:23.495 --> 03:34:28.699]  Dogs having holes drilled in their heads to see how long they can survive.
[03:34:29.619 --> 03:34:33.702]  Inducing heart attacks in poor defenseless animals.
[03:34:34.303 --> 03:34:36.864]  Collapsing the lungs of dogs.
[03:34:38.325 --> 03:34:46.190]  We are long past the time that any of this canine research can yield any valuable information.
[03:34:47.090 --> 03:35:02.920]  I have written on behalf of the Daily Caller and InfoWars calling on the Veterans Administration Secretary David Shulkin to end these horrific, barbaric practices.
[03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:06.262]  And what we got was a lie.
[03:35:06.842 --> 03:35:14.989]  What we were told was that experiments of dogs will now require a higher level of approval.
[03:35:16.390 --> 03:35:17.911]  Unacceptable.
[03:35:19.997 --> 03:35:25.240]  Please join me in emailing Secretary Shulkin now.
[03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:34.805]  Tell him to stop the bizarre, barbaric, inhumane medical experiments on man's best friend.
[03:35:35.485 --> 03:35:42.969]  We're going to put up his address, but you can reach him at david.shulkin.com.
[03:35:44.529 --> 03:35:54.132]  We must get the Veterans Administration in the Trump era to end these horrific experiments on dogs.
[03:36:08.155 --> 03:36:12.420]  They are yielding no useful medical information.
[03:36:12.880 --> 03:36:15.543]  They are outdated and bizarre.
[03:36:16.164 --> 03:36:27.937]  Now, it's very important to note that the American war veterans recently came out against this practice and urged Secretary Shulkin to end it.
[03:36:28.678 --> 03:36:40.425]  Don't tell us it will take a higher level of approval, because that means that bizarre experiments are still being conducted on poor, helpless, defenseless animals.
[03:36:40.865 --> 03:36:43.746]  Stop this process now.
[03:36:44.327 --> 03:36:50.770]  Let's put Secretary Shulkin's email up on the screen as soon as we can.
[03:36:51.291 --> 03:36:57.114]  We need you folks, the InfoWarrior audience, to email the Secretary today.
[03:36:57.854 --> 03:37:07.340]  And in respectful terms, no name-calling, not in all caps, but urge them to end medical experiments on dogs.
[03:37:07.980 --> 03:37:09.441]  God will bless you.
[03:37:09.901 --> 03:37:10.502]  Many thanks.
[03:37:11.062 --> 03:37:12.423]  Now joining me is
[03:37:14.364 --> 03:37:17.947]  Jacob Engels of the Central Florida Post.
[03:37:18.508 --> 03:37:31.298]  Jacob Engels had his own star turn on TV last week when he evaded the screeners at CNN and got into a panel in which there was a discussion of gun control.
[03:37:32.099 --> 03:37:42.403]  That was bad news for CNN because Jacob Engels is an articulate libertarian, a regular contributor here at InfoWars.
[03:37:43.464 --> 03:37:45.465]  Jacob, tell us what happened on CNN.
[03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:58.914]  Well, it's great to be on the program, and quite frankly, they deceptively edited parts of the interview that did not fit the narrative of gun grabbing and gun control.
[03:37:59.474 --> 03:38:06.036]  I brought up the point of how Nazi Germany systematically disarmed the citizenry, and we saw what happened there.
[03:38:06.517 --> 03:38:13.139]  I brought up the fact that in post-Civil War, all the way up through Jim Crow era, apartheid, racist South,
[03:38:13.926 --> 03:38:28.011]  In the United States, you have local, state, government systematically disarming African Americans, and they didn't want to air that because it made the point that there is a legitimate reason still for us to exercise our Second Amendment right.
[03:38:28.051 --> 03:38:35.633]  They want to say that, oh, the government will never do anything wrong, the government has no history of abusing the citizenry, and that's just flat-out false.
[03:38:37.673 --> 03:38:41.576]  This was riveting television to watch you.
[03:38:41.656 --> 03:38:48.561]  Now, moving on, you have written a piece about the journalist Mike Isikoff.
[03:38:49.261 --> 03:38:55.066]  Now, let me say at the top that Mike Isikoff did some extraordinary reporting, early reporting
[03:38:55.786 --> 03:39:15.081]  on corruption in the Clinton administration, and was one of the reporters who reported early on about the serial sexual assaults of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's role in intimidating and bullying his victims.
[03:39:15.721 --> 03:39:21.205]  But more recently, Mr. Isikoff's name came up as the journalist
[03:39:21.946 --> 03:39:39.698]  Who the FBI used to plant a story that hyped the phony dossier, then turning around and pointing to his story before the court as evidence that this was real, you see?
[03:39:40.619 --> 03:39:45.783]  Yahoo.com is writing about it, your honor, therefore it must be true.
[03:39:46.623 --> 03:39:48.805]  Tell us about what you learned, Jacob.
[03:39:49.861 --> 03:40:02.252]  Well, we learned that in the investigation that Mr. Isikoff was basing his data off dirty dossier, first and foremost, and that he put up this what can only be called an opinion piece.
[03:40:02.312 --> 03:40:08.617]  It's not factual, it's not based in reality, and yet the United States government used it
[03:40:09.491 --> 03:40:24.938]  As a reason to obtain a warrantless FISA spying application to spy on a Republican candidate for President of the United States, this is right out of Gestapo-era tactics that they used in Nazi Germany to crush the opposition.
[03:40:25.318 --> 03:40:29.240]  It's no different, and Mr. Isikoff, quite frankly, should be ashamed of himself.
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:36.944]  He's not an investigative reporter, because clearly he didn't investigate his own quote-unquote facts that he's promoting, but this is all the deep state
[03:40:37.964 --> 03:40:47.267]  Globalist, military-industrial-complex narrative that Mr. Isikoff bought, and it's quite shameful, and he should have his journalism card revoked.
[03:40:47.287 --> 03:40:56.909]  I mean, he likes to talk about info wars and other organizations that are not mainstream, not being credible journalism, but Mr. Isikoff, you're not credible.
[03:40:57.209 --> 03:41:06.412]  You based your information on a dirty dossier, and because of that, illegal, sublime, and seditious activity occurred in the United States under your guise.
[03:41:07.992 --> 03:41:09.213]  It's kind of interesting.
[03:41:09.673 --> 03:41:13.376]  I was on with Sean Hannity last night and we talked about this.
[03:41:13.897 --> 03:41:30.711]  This entire new focus on WikiLeaks, the entire focus on Russian collusion, trying to reinflate what is an uninflated narrative, is really an attempt to distract from the stunning fact
[03:41:31.411 --> 03:41:51.091]  That the Obama Department of Justice and the Obama FBI utilized a dossier created by a foreign agent, in this case Christopher Steele, working with Russians as the legal rationale for the widespread state surveillance
[03:41:51.852 --> 03:41:53.493]  Of Donald Trump and his campaign.
[03:41:54.173 --> 03:41:57.414]  Try to get your head around that for just a moment.
[03:41:57.494 --> 03:42:00.815]  This is an egregious abuse of power.
[03:42:02.035 --> 03:42:10.538]  Use of the surveillance authority of the state to spy on one of the two major candidates for president.
[03:42:11.318 --> 03:42:19.140]  As I told Sean Handy last night on air, it makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:31.064]  And now the Democrats and their handmaidens in the mainstream media will do anything to distract attention from the fact that they are busted.
[03:42:31.724 --> 03:42:32.604]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:32.824 --> 03:42:35.865]  Thanks to Jacob Engels with the Central Florida Post.
[03:42:36.265 --> 03:42:37.845]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:38.045 --> 03:42:39.566]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:48.919 --> 03:42:50.776]  Yeah, we're good.
[03:43:02.869 --> 03:43:12.156]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:43:12.996 --> 03:43:20.282]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[03:43:21.042 --> 03:43:27.386]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:43:28.186 --> 03:43:33.449]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:43:34.050 --> 03:43:42.755]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including

[03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:28.612]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:44:29.292 --> 03:44:32.313]  Info Wars Life wants to bring you the highest quality products.

[03:44:51.463 --> 03:44:55.706]  Grab a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:56.546 --> 03:44:58.448]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:05.444 --> 03:45:12.205]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[03:45:12.365 --> 03:45:14.206]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[03:45:14.366 --> 03:45:20.067]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[03:45:20.147 --> 03:45:30.868]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[03:45:30.888 --> 03:45:33.669]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[03:45:33.749 --> 03:45:51.181]  Well, I designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were going to come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were going to come out with DNA Force Plus,
[03:45:51.801 --> 03:46:01.705]  You just use that name and do it, because this is such an incredible formula, and I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country, and so you're able to scale up and lower price, and I want to do that.
[03:46:02.085 --> 03:46:07.347]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Shell Force, or vice versa.
[03:46:07.407 --> 03:46:09.448]  I was partnering with him on that, that's how classy he is.
[03:46:09.508 --> 03:46:11.468]  So, Shell Force is a limited run.
[03:46:11.549 --> 03:46:12.969]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[03:46:13.069 --> 03:46:17.951]  It will be called DNA Force Plus, because it's stronger than the old DNA Force,
[03:46:18.311 --> 03:46:19.972]  And it is less money.
[03:46:20.092 --> 03:46:25.273]  It's a good deal normally at $149, like DNA Force was, and we'd sell it for $99 on sale.
[03:46:25.353 --> 03:46:27.254]  We're selling it for $70.45.
[03:46:28.054 --> 03:46:31.115]  Used to, that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA Force.
[03:46:31.155 --> 03:46:34.136]  Well, now we've lowered the price on the ingredients by buying even more.
[03:46:34.256 --> 03:46:36.456]  Just as high quality, we're lowering it for you.
[03:46:36.476 --> 03:46:38.857]  This is the best deal ever on DNA Force.
[03:46:39.277 --> 03:46:41.998]  It's DNA Force Plus, but called Cell Force.
[03:46:42.478 --> 03:46:56.390]  Because we weren't going to step on groups toes, we just put out CellForce separately, with a similar name to DNAForce, and it's even stronger and a lower price, super high quality, promotes cellular energy production, supports optimal mental health and so much more, and it supports the InfoWar.
[03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:58.932]  Get the best deal ever at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:47:06.238 --> 03:47:08.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.830 --> 03:47:33.398]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.899 --> 03:47:36.802]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:40.427 --> 03:47:41.068]  Welcome back.
[03:47:42.441 --> 03:47:45.123]  You're on Freedom Command Central.
[03:47:45.183 --> 03:47:48.927]  That's right, it's the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:47:49.647 --> 03:47:53.871]  We are the news outlet that the tech left fears.
[03:47:54.171 --> 03:47:59.897]  We are the news organization that makes the globalists tremble.
[03:48:00.477 --> 03:48:03.139]  That's why they seek to censor us.
[03:48:04.140 --> 03:48:08.422]  Extraordinarily good news out of the Justice Department.
[03:48:08.602 --> 03:48:22.127]  The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a woman who claims that she was denied her right not to have a mandatory vaccination.
[03:48:22.927 --> 03:48:34.094]  Now, we here at InfoWars have questioned the safety of vaccinations, or more precisely, questioned the safety of what's in vaccinations.
[03:48:35.174 --> 03:48:44.360]  And incredibly, this lawsuit by the Trump Justice Department has the potential to break this issue wide open.
[03:48:45.120 --> 03:48:51.862]  The state of California is ground zero in the mandatory vaccination movement.
[03:48:52.423 --> 03:49:01.266]  This is where they will not let you send your children to a public school unless they've had the state prescribed vaccinations.
[03:49:02.006 --> 03:49:05.107]  That is very, very scary.
[03:49:05.667 --> 03:49:09.848]  So kudos to the Trump Justice Department.
[03:49:10.828 --> 03:49:23.771]  The congressman from California, Adam Schiff, has actually sponsored a House resolution that declares vaccinations to be safe.
[03:49:24.771 --> 03:49:38.459]  And denies that the United States government has ever paid out a penny to the lawsuit process to people who have been injured by supposedly safe vaccinations.
[03:49:39.359 --> 03:49:40.860]  In fact, the U.S.
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:53.768]  government, we, the taxpayers, have paid out in excess of $3.5 billion to individuals who were damaged by vaccinations.
[03:49:54.808 --> 03:50:04.772]  This is akin to sponsoring a resolution that says the Holocaust didn't happen, or World War II didn't happen.
[03:50:06.092 --> 03:50:13.215]  It is a disgrace, but it's pandering for Big Pharma campaign dollars.
[03:50:13.755 --> 03:50:20.078]  Kudos for the Trump Justice Department for filing this landmark suit.
[03:50:21.516 --> 03:50:33.145]  Now, I, as I said, appeared on MSNBC's Meet the Press yesterday, and then later in the day with the great Sean Hannity.
[03:50:34.626 --> 03:50:44.013]  All of these were in the wake of the tragic meltdown of my former colleague in the Trump campaign, Sam Nunberg.
[03:50:44.773 --> 03:50:52.959]  Sam Nunberg is a brilliant researcher writer who very clearly is dealing with his demons.
[03:50:53.739 --> 03:51:14.313]  I made it clear on Meet the Press and with Sean Hannity that Mr. Nunberg is a man who marches to his own drummer and he is a man who is not speaking on my behalf or at my behest or based on my advice.
[03:51:15.294 --> 03:51:36.354]  In the wake of all of this, because Nunberg indicated that he was not of a mind to cooperate with a subpoena for document production that would theoretically include email traffic between he and I, along with Corey Lewandowski, Hope Hicks,
[03:51:37.014 --> 03:51:43.323]  Steve Bannon, Steve Miller, Donald Trump, and dozens of others.
[03:51:44.324 --> 03:51:51.774]  I was treated to a recycle by the mainstream media of the patented lie
[03:51:52.595 --> 03:52:11.110]  That I knew about the WikiLeaks disclosures, specifically the quote-unquote Russian hack of the DNC, that I received this information from WikiLeaks and that I shared it with the Trump campaign and Donald Trump.
[03:52:11.831 --> 03:52:14.893]  Let's be very clear yet again.
[03:52:16.014 --> 03:52:29.344]  I had no advance notice of the content, source, or exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures that so thoroughly wrenched the Hillary campaign.
[03:52:30.025 --> 03:52:41.274]  I received nothing whatsoever from WikiLeaks or from Julian Assange, and you cannot pass on what you never had.
[03:52:41.954 --> 03:52:55.143]  I did have a confirming source who told me that when Assange said publicly that he had a catch of material on Hillary Clinton and that he would publish it, it was true.
[03:52:57.424 --> 03:53:23.986]  Going even further, the Washington Post, in a piece by Jennifer Rubin, took a line from the Democrats' memo, authored by Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and Congressman Himes from my home state of Connecticut and others, saying that the Russians gave hacked material to Trump insiders for review.
[03:53:24.887 --> 03:53:28.850]  Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post said that was Roger Stone.
[03:53:29.310 --> 03:53:31.992]  The piece can still be found online.
[03:53:32.692 --> 03:53:49.184]  When I raised this yesterday on the MSNBC Meet the Press discussion, Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times said that this piece didn't exist and that the Washington Post had never said this.
[03:53:49.844 --> 03:53:53.546]  Please, Michelle, get your fake news straight.
[03:53:54.167 --> 03:53:55.828]  The upshot of all of this?
[03:53:56.268 --> 03:53:57.409]  Well, it's not pleasant.
[03:53:57.909 --> 03:54:07.535]  The Washington Post, Salon, and Vice, all speculating that I will be indicted by Special Counsel Mueller.
[03:54:08.055 --> 03:54:17.921]  Specifically for the crime of getting information from WikiLeaks and passing it to Donald Trump and the Trump campaign.
[03:54:18.401 --> 03:54:34.731]  So one more time, I received no such information and the truth is, I never discussed in any way, shape or form the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary Clinton with candidate or President Donald Trump.
[03:54:35.251 --> 03:54:37.133]  There is no case here.
[03:54:37.573 --> 03:54:51.127]  Julian Assange himself has said, accurately, that I was able to predict what WikiLeaks would do by very carefully following his interviews and his tweets and repeating what I had learned.
[03:54:51.707 --> 03:54:53.608]  There's no secret here.
[03:54:54.428 --> 03:55:03.532]  What you do have is the wishful thinking of talking heads like Ari Melber, who don't know what they are talking about.
[03:55:04.093 --> 03:55:09.215]  It is mean-spirited and the epitome of fake news.
[03:55:09.835 --> 03:55:17.922]  There is no evidence whatsoever that I knew about and passed on anything from WikiLeaks or the Russians.
[03:55:18.383 --> 03:55:27.230]  The entire thing is bullshit, made up, false, meant to damage and distract.
[03:55:27.891 --> 03:55:29.392]  What do they want to distract from?
[03:55:31.004 --> 03:55:32.865]  My friend Sean Hannity said it best.
[03:55:33.605 --> 03:55:53.053]  What we have here is the greatest single scandal of political espionage in American history, where they used the FBI and the Justice Department, used what they knew was fabricated evidence to justify the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign for president.
[03:55:53.633 --> 03:55:55.894]  After he was the Republican nominee.
[03:56:17.045 --> 03:56:40.951]  If you have questions about internet censorship, questions about what transpired with WikiLeaks and these devastating DNC revelations, questions about vaccinations, questions about the Veterans Administration bizarre and inhumane experiments on dogs, or anything else you want to talk about,
[03:56:41.511 --> 03:56:44.372]  Join us on the other side, on the war room.
[03:56:44.412 --> 03:56:49.433]  That number again, 1-888-201-2244.
[03:56:50.094 --> 03:56:59.516]  This is your opportunity to ask questions about everything that's in the information war today.
[03:57:00.016 --> 03:57:01.097]  And lastly, folks,
[03:57:01.917 --> 03:57:05.259]  Help us in this struggle against the internet censors.
[03:57:05.659 --> 03:57:12.102]  Help us beat back YouTube and Google and others who would strangle the First Amendment.
[03:57:12.362 --> 03:57:18.485]  Who want to silence InfoWars because we bring you the unvarnished truth.
[03:57:18.885 --> 03:57:25.768]  Because we stand up against the globalists and their godless, atheistic, pedophile armies.
[03:57:26.288 --> 03:57:29.790]  We are the tip of the spear and we need your help.
[03:57:33.651 --> 03:57:40.794]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:57:52.180 --> 03:58:01.025]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[03:58:02.253 --> 03:58:04.055]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:58:04.095 --> 03:58:11.221]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:58:11.641 --> 03:58:17.407]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:58:18.107 --> 03:58:19.428]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:58:20.029 --> 03:58:39.085]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:58:40.006 --> 03:58:40.186]  I think?
