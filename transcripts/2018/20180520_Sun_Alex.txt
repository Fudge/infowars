[00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.992]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:17.175]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:26.282]  We were the first to expose Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
[00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.464]  We were the first to expose
[00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:38.259]  The deep state Clinton-Obama-Mueller mole trying to burrow into the Trump campaign to create fake Russia connections.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.485]  We were the first to report on Cambridge professor Stefan Alper last Sunday.
[00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.932]  On Friday, the New York Times was given the laurels.
[00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.954]  They broke the spy.
[00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:57.355]  The mole.
[00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.736]  But they said, Trump's still not right.
[00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:02.338]  It's an informant, not a mole, not a spy.
[00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:04.319]  Potato patata.
[00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.202]  Just like we first broke here.
[00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:11.443]  Three days.
[00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:12.664]  Four days.
[00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:16.546]  Before.
[00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:31.176]  The news even picked it up that Ted Malik was questioned, and now I realize Ted knows a bunch of these MI6 people.
[00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.737]  Halprin's an Anglophile, he's an American living in the UK.
[00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:42.119]  So that's all coming up today, but what you're really going to get is the Big Roger Stone exclusive.
[00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:43.980]  If you go to DrugsReport.com,
[00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:51.996]  You'll notice on the right-hand side it says Roger Stone prepared for Mueller indictment.
[00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:57.217]  Well, you're going to get the exclusive of what him and his lawyers have been meeting on the last two days.
[00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:03.399]  It says Trump may not run again if he can knock it out of the park and have success with the whole program he wants.
[00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.359]  That's what Trump privately told him was planned.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.980]  Stone told me that over dinner two years ago.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.541]  He said if Trump can totally knock it out of the park, he knows it's hard to do that in the second term,
[00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:18.804]  He'd like to come in, gracefully exit, and do something nobody ever does.
[00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:20.345]  That's beyond George Washington.
[00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.086]  He served two terms, and then they wanted to make him king, and he left.
[00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:32.012]  If Trump can turn the country around in one term, get another patriot in and leave, that is as slick as it gets.
[00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:36.795]  It doesn't get any more suave or just totally cool.
[00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:38.736]  It's the next dimension of that.
[00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:42.299]  Now, if Trump can't get it done,
[00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:47.825]  He will stay in there.
[00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:49.506]  And he's going to run again.
[00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.266]  He can't help it.
[00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:51.946]  He's not going to get everything he wants done.
[00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:54.647]  They're going to be gunning for him, trying to bring him down.
[00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:57.147]  He's got to stay in just to protect himself.
[00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:03.748]  So Stone is going to be joining us.
[00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:08.549]  I talked to him an hour plus yesterday, several times today.
[00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.130]  And I don't know how much I can say on air.
[00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.331]  I'm going to just let him say it himself.
[00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:15.931]  In fact, I'm making the decision.
[00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.382]  That he's going to host the second hour.
[00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.986]  He's going to join us in 30 minutes, but I'm going to just let him host.
[00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.930]  He wants me to stay, but I'm going to have him host the second hour.
[00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.718]  And I rarely bug Drudge, but I think I'm going to send Drudge an email and say, hey, you linked to me in my rant about Trump bombing Syria.
[00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.800]  Wow, thank you, but I didn't know that was going to happen.
[00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:48.852]  I think this Roger Stone unfiltered hosting for an hour is something everybody should tweet, everybody should Facebook, everybody should get out because Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:55.814]  I said they're wearing us out with this Russian stuff to change the subject from the success of the economy, the border, sovereignty.
[00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:09.564]  To make the election look like a fraud, to tell voters you didn't get Trump elected, to change the subject from WikiLeaks and how the globalists have been basically totally refused and a major political realignment that history shows you cannot turn back.
[00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.277]  Unless you kill the majority of the population.
[00:04:13.477 --> 00:04:14.017]  You just can't do it.
[00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:15.598]  But the globalists don't know when to quit.
[00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.940]  But now, I told Stone, I said, yes.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.344]  Now let's go Great Guns on my broadcast about Russiagate because it's pregnant, nine months, and it's going into labor, baby.
[00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.305]  The water broke on this sucker.
[00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:28.366]  And it's a monster.
[00:04:28.846 --> 00:04:31.288]  And it is to overturn the president, overturn the election.
[00:04:31.348 --> 00:04:32.328]  It is about impeachment.
[00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.149]  And they're going to go for the internet.
[00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:35.470]  They're going to go for everything.
[00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.631]  The battle plan is public.
[00:04:37.662 --> 00:04:46.384]  So, we're covering one of the top stories in the country, the inside scoop on the attempt to overthrow this election and your will and what you did, America.
[00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:51.445]  This is about you and an attempted robbery by these crooks we're trying to evict out of our house.
[00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:53.426]  They're gonna lose.
[00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:56.306]  We'll be back on the other side.
[00:04:56.387 --> 00:04:57.907]  Please spread all the links.
[00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:08.963]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:16.910]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.354]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:25.237]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:29.540]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.503]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:05:32.903 --> 00:05:37.206]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:40.729]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:55.942]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:57.504]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:05:57.744 --> 00:06:00.026]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.120]  We've got it.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.305]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:11.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:19.733]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.338]  Keep the conditioning!
[00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:25.399]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.200]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.040]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.761]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:30.784]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:40.352]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:42.033]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:06:42.093 --> 00:06:46.057]  It's time for it to confirm there are at least some shooters with fully automated weapons.
[00:06:47.452 --> 00:06:52.119]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.922]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:06:54.962 --> 00:06:57.486]  It was almost as if there were plants imploding.
[00:06:57.706 --> 00:06:59.168]  It just pancaked.
[00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:03.815]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.526]  I think this is a national security encounter.
[00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:13.809]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.129]  UFOs.
[00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.170]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.231]  Is it one world?
[00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.711]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:25.214]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:07:25.254 --> 00:07:28.575]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:34.279]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:35.680]  Russian scum!
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.401]  Denied everything.
[00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:38.162]  He called it all fake news.
[00:07:38.222 --> 00:07:40.764]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:43.006]  This is a national emergency.
[00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:48.811]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:50.412]  This is a female high level emergency.
[00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:54.030]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.792]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:03.133]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:04.953]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:09.895]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:12.396]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.971]  And it is Sunday, the 20th day of May 2018.
[00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:20.092]  We'll be live here for the next two hours.
[00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:24.414]  Roger Stone is going to be hosting the second hour today.
[00:08:24.434 --> 00:08:38.579]  I'll be here in the wings while he's Skyping in, but I'm going to really give him the floor so he can lay out the most complete compendium of the whole Russiagate fraud that's now coming to a rotting head.
[00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:58.044]  And that is threatening to attempt to overturn the election of 2016 and usher in nightmare scenarios of anti-free speech, race war promotion the globalists are pushing, really the hell that we'd already be in if Donald John Trump hadn't been elected.
[00:08:58.584 --> 00:09:00.286]  And he's already begun to turn the ship around.
[00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.788]  That's why the globalists are panicking.
[00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:05.351]  This is a real counter coup in America.
[00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:07.833]  Does it mean Trump's perfect?
[00:09:08.013 --> 00:09:08.173]  No.
[00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:09.794]  But he's a nationalist.
[00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:11.274]  He believes in the country.
[00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:13.054]  He's not out to get the nation.
[00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:14.555]  He's a capitalist.
[00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:16.235]  He's not anti-Christian.
[00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:21.896]  I can't believe he's gotten this much good stuff done.
[00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:25.117]  Do I get mad at him sometimes when he bombs Syria or whatever?
[00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:25.717]  Yeah.
[00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:30.218]  But it doesn't mean I am not, beside myself, happy about everything else.
[00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:36.488]  Now Trump's saying the DOJ will investigate whether Obama administration spied on campaign.
[00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:37.689]  Let's stop right there.
[00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:46.413]  Let me just announce, obviously, the big issue here.
[00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:56.858]  I got a call from Roger Friday night and I missed it because I'd gone to bed like midnight.
[00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:08.489]  And then I talked to him in the morning and he said they just grabbed six people and he goes, I think they might be able to threaten one of them into flipping on me.
[00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:18.112]  Not to report anything he'd done bad, but just to get them so scared that they'd done something wrong themselves that they would then get some process deal on stone, money laundering.
[00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:22.233]  You know, I mean, a checkbook error is a felony.
[00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:29.076]  Alan Dershowitz has written a book about how this works and how the average person commits three felonies a day.
[00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:30.397]  So that's what happens.
[00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:34.479]  Or they get you to, quote, make misleading statements to the FBI.
[00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:35.460]  You talk to them for an hour.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.601]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:37.501]  Get something wrong.
[00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:47.588]  Oh, grand jury's going to indict you because the federal law says if you got a date wrong or just anything, that technically you're going to spend many years in prison.
[00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:49.665]  That law should be overturned.
[00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:51.967]  It's a law for the mafia and all the rest of it.
[00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:55.371]  It's turned the FBI into the mafia at the highest levels.
[00:10:57.192 --> 00:10:59.254]  And the globalists are destroying the mainstream media.
[00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:00.516]  They're destroying the FBI.
[00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:02.898]  They're riding this horse till it dies.
[00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:06.481]  They're riding the horse till its heart gives out.
[00:11:07.102 --> 00:11:11.226]  And then they jump on another horse because they want full power.
[00:11:11.286 --> 00:11:12.307]  This is 21st century war.
[00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:16.781]  So I talked to him a bunch Saturday and I talked to him again today.
[00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:19.942]  He's been meeting with his lawyers in DC, in Miami.
[00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:21.082]  He's in Florida now.
[00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:23.663]  He said, no, it's really bad news.
[00:11:23.703 --> 00:11:28.703]  Just when I talked to him two hours ago, he said, it's eight people they scooped up.
[00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:29.864]  Some of them they raided.
[00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.804]  Eight people they scooped up this week.
[00:11:32.864 --> 00:11:37.145]  And he said, buddy, by the way, everybody always says Stone's this dirty trickster.
[00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:38.265]  This guy, he's never lied to me.
[00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.805]  The guy's incredibly accurate.
[00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.426]  In fact, his predictions have all been dead on.
[00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:43.466]  He said,
[00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:47.223]  What's the big focus was on you?
[00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:48.963]  And let me explain how this works.
[00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:52.685]  The FBI hadn't questioned Trump yet.
[00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:53.805]  They haven't questioned Stone yet.
[00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:54.905]  They've not talked to me yet.
[00:11:55.826 --> 00:12:01.828]  Even though they were in McClatchy a year ago in congressional hearings saying we're investigating Alex Jones.
[00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:08.751]  FBI-led investigative team examines role of conservative news sites.
[00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:10.697]  In Russia campaign.
[00:12:11.517 --> 00:12:12.698]  That's the article from last year.
[00:12:12.718 --> 00:12:15.940]  Will you guys pull up the actual digital copy, please, for TV viewers?
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.820]  I want to show them the date.
[00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:24.024]  And you, it says right here, Alex Jones under FBI investigation.
[00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:27.787]  There it is, InfoWars, Alex Jones, all right there.
[00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:36.272]  Now, a year later, that was back in April 3rd, 2017.
[00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:50.444]  Now fast forward to over a year from now and in the final ring of the people they're investigating, and that's in the news.
[00:12:50.484 --> 00:12:54.325]  The FBI's on the news saying, we're closing in on Stone and President Trump.
[00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:57.166]  Soon we'll show you the evidence we've got.
[00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:58.506]  Total malarkey.
[00:12:59.864 --> 00:13:03.268]  It's Mueller and Hillary and all of them with their eyeballs in Russian collusion on record.
[00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:07.412]  Tarmac uranium deals with Mueller, like a James Bond movie.
[00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:10.415]  Hundreds of millions of dollars going into slush funds.
[00:13:11.376 --> 00:13:12.237]  Tony Podesta.
[00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:13.859]  I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:19.865]  So they know they're going to get in trouble for Russian collusion, which Democrats are famous for.
[00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:25.019]  And the Chinese collusion is just a hundred times worse conservatively as everybody knows.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.062]  But still, it's there with the Russians.
[00:13:27.442 --> 00:13:30.165]  And so they say Trump's doing it and make up all these lies.
[00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:38.736]  And so in the final ring, it's so surreal that as the noose tightens on nothing,
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.742]  They are obsessing on InfoWars.
[00:13:43.403 --> 00:13:46.385]  And obsessing on, does Alex Jones know WikiLeaks?
[00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:50.309]  Does Alex Jones know Guccifer 2.0?
[00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.412]  Does Alex Jones know all these people?
[00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.415]  Is Alex Jones a Russian agent?
[00:13:57.455 --> 00:13:58.416]  Do you know Alex Jones?
[00:13:58.456 --> 00:13:59.757]  How much money does Roger Stone make?
[00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:01.138]  What's Alex Jones pay him?
[00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:02.860]  Have you ever talked to Alex Jones?
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.581]  Is Alex Jones a Russian agent?
[00:14:05.162 --> 00:14:06.363]  And these people are like, what?
[00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:07.384]  Alex Jones now?
[00:14:09.568 --> 00:14:11.188]  Well, we don't want to put you in prison.
[00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:13.109]  You just need to tell us about Alex Jones.
[00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:14.009]  Now, he's a Russian.
[00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:16.769]  We really want to hear that Alex Jones is a Russian.
[00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:20.630]  This is beyond Monty Python level at this point, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:30.032]  Because I knew the Russiagate thing was phony, but in a complex election, and the way the Russians do try to burrow into stuff, like any other major country, they've got their people, their PR folks, their lobbyists everywhere.
[00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:34.352]  That's what's really important, is lobbyists, not spies.
[00:14:34.532 --> 00:14:35.472]  It's the same thing, really.
[00:14:36.293 --> 00:14:38.073]  I figured there'd be something, but there isn't!
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:52.251]  And now to know that it's InfoWars in the final equation, and that I'm sure I'm going to get subpoenaed or Lord knows what, here's the problem.
[00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:58.957]  Mueller famously, when he's setting a Patsy up, the Patsy dies right before indictment.
[00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:00.827]  Or right after indictment.
[00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:02.448]  And I'm going to go over some cases of that.
[00:15:02.508 --> 00:15:04.509]  Mueller is super bad news.
[00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:06.190]  Covered up World Trade Center.
[00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.051]  Helped cover up Oklahoma City later.
[00:15:08.071 --> 00:15:10.672]  Ran all those big cover-ups.
[00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.134]  Did the whole fake anthrax investigations.
[00:15:13.174 --> 00:15:14.855]  Then the third patch, he died.
[00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:18.077]  I remember reading in local news that the FBI grabbed him.
[00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:22.520]  He was suicidal, so they took him to a hospital where he died of eating Tylenol.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.322]  You read the Wikipedia now, it says he died in a hospital.
[00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:27.903]  Nothing about FBI custody.
[00:15:29.022 --> 00:15:30.402]  And other articles say he died at home.
[00:15:31.022 --> 00:15:32.863]  So, I mean, that's how this works.
[00:15:33.483 --> 00:15:35.023]  That's why Stone's been T-boned.
[00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:38.264]  Somebody shot him with a gelatin dart with polonium in it.
[00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:41.925]  People make jokes about this and they go, what is this, a James Bond movie?
[00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:43.185]  This is the real world.
[00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:45.566]  This is the stuff that's going on.
[00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:48.227]  So you're going to get the exclusive on all this coming up.
[00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:54.508]  And we're going to tell you who the most dangerous man in America is on the other side of this break.
[00:15:54.928 --> 00:15:58.369]  I'm going to tell you out of the gate who the most dangerous man in America is on the other side.

[00:18:57.401 --> 00:18:57.641]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.952]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:04.972 --> 00:19:07.995]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:09.957]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.257 --> 00:19:11.979]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:14.761]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:18.985]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:21.447]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:22.308 --> 00:19:24.630]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.071]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:27.231]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:28.512]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:28.932 --> 00:19:29.973]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.013 --> 00:19:31.094]  Put him on pause again.
[00:19:31.114 --> 00:19:31.934]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:37.578]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:42.160]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:42.401 --> 00:19:45.282]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:45.543 --> 00:19:45.923]  You understand?
[00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:47.284]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:48.765]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:54.689]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.330]  You understand?
[00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.632]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:06.719]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:26.250]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:33.018]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:39.724 --> 00:20:43.388]  We're going to break down the most dangerous man in America here in just a moment.
[00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:53.060]  The most dangerous individual that threatens this Republic, this country, and our future because of their dereliction of duty and their clear fact that they're compromised.
[00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:56.924]  But if you just tuned in, I have confirmed with Roger Stone
[00:20:58.214 --> 00:20:58.694]  And others.
[00:20:59.274 --> 00:21:12.877]  That eight people have been dragnetted, grabbed off airplanes, visited at their offices, subpoenaed, drugged in by the FBI, in some cases, talked to for eight hours straight one day and three hours the next day.
[00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:17.637]  And the big news here is, they're getting ready to indict Roger Stone.
[00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:22.538]  In fact, there's the NBC headlines, Roger Stone prepared for Mueller indictment.
[00:21:24.499 --> 00:21:26.219]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.925]  The other big piece of the puzzle is they then keep obsessing on yours truly.
[00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:41.912]  And at one level it's comical, but at the other level it's not funny.
[00:21:43.413 --> 00:21:52.100]  Because I already showed you earlier the McClatchy News from April 3rd, 2017, where they say that I am under criminal investigation by the FBI.
[00:21:52.381 --> 00:21:53.382]  Not your regular FBI.
[00:21:54.991 --> 00:21:59.395]  The response to bank robberies and, you know, real money laundering and MS-13, great men and women.
[00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:01.617]  I know a lot of those folks are listeners.
[00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:03.338]  Believe me, I do.
[00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:08.883]  We got a lot of folks working on this building, just so happen to have uncles and people that are FBI agents.
[00:22:09.904 --> 00:22:11.125]  And they agree with us, by the way.
[00:22:12.006 --> 00:22:12.567]  They like Trump.
[00:22:12.607 --> 00:22:13.407]  They know what's going on.
[00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:20.534]  But this special Obama-Clinton-created thing that's been there for decades,
[00:22:22.822 --> 00:22:25.585]  Is what's covered up for the Clintons and Obama to commit all these crimes.
[00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:33.612]  And it's creepville when this starts to unfold.
[00:22:34.592 --> 00:22:35.073]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:22:35.133 --> 00:22:36.134]  Even the New York Post reported on it.
[00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:36.894]  I'd forgotten that one.
[00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:42.179]  Breitbart and Infowars are drawn to FBI's Russian bot probe.
[00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:46.083]  But it goes way beyond that.
[00:22:47.724 --> 00:22:48.525]  And so, oh look!
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:23:07.300]  Cambridge Professor, right next to that, the big breaking news Friday is, drumroll, who is the FBI mole criminally sent by Obama and Hillary into the Trump camp to try to talk about Russiagate and try to plant Russian connections so he could then later try to set people up.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.603]  That's the info that's emerging.
[00:23:10.862 --> 00:23:13.984]  Who did we break last Sunday here on this show?
[00:23:14.884 --> 00:23:17.206]  In fact, let's go to YouTube and even pull that up from last Sunday.
[00:23:17.226 --> 00:23:22.229]  I think the headline is, Roger Stone outs names the FBI mole.
[00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.992]  And we say, Cambridge Professor Stefan Halper!
[00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:30.073]  Come on down!
[00:23:30.574 --> 00:23:37.478]  But now Newsweek and Time and the New York Times and oh, they all broke it Friday.
[00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.491]  They know we're loyal Americans.
[00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:43.433]  They know we believe in free markets.
[00:23:43.493 --> 00:23:44.553]  We believe in this country.
[00:23:44.573 --> 00:23:45.094]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:23:45.434 --> 00:23:45.834]  Breaking.
[00:23:45.914 --> 00:23:48.696]  Roger Stone just out of the FBI mole inside the Trump campaign.
[00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:50.317]  Only 43,000 views.
[00:23:50.357 --> 00:23:53.279]  Because they've got a shadow band.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.101]  Where you've got to go on the page to find it.
[00:23:56.121 --> 00:24:01.885]  That's why you've got to go to Infowars.com or Newswars.com because more and more we're just blocked on the internet, folks.
[00:24:01.905 --> 00:24:02.766]  You've got to go to our sites.
[00:24:03.106 --> 00:24:04.047]  Not Twitter, not Facebook.
[00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:06.228]  If you're watching us on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube, great.
[00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:07.149]  Spread those live links.
[00:24:08.553 --> 00:24:10.514]  But a lot of times the live feeds are capped.
[00:24:11.415 --> 00:24:13.757]  So you've got to, you can't even share them when it's live.
[00:24:13.777 --> 00:24:17.219]  You got to share them when it's archived, after the show is not live.
[00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:18.340]  This is a war.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.661]  And why do they want to shut down?
[00:24:20.941 --> 00:24:24.884]  Because seven days ago I sat here, and I told you it was Halperin.
[00:24:25.484 --> 00:24:27.185]  And I told you he was planting stuff.
[00:24:27.906 --> 00:24:30.968]  And by the way, I have the former head of the Davos group calling me up.
[00:24:33.683 --> 00:24:35.244]  And I'm not even name-dropping here.
[00:24:35.364 --> 00:24:50.675]  I'm so busy with the generals and the CIA people and Roger Stone and my own issues that I haven't even called back people who have been trying to call me for a week with the breaking intel on something even more insane.
[00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:53.297]  And I don't know why I haven't returned their phone calls.
[00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:54.518]  I just ought to call them right now.
[00:24:56.019 --> 00:24:56.739]  Call Ted Malik.
[00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:57.640]  Apologize to him.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.881]  I know he's been desperately trying to talk.
[00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:00.542]  I don't know why I didn't talk to him.
[00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:01.383]  I said so much hitting me.
[00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:04.534]  Let's just see if he'll pop on today.
[00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:24.669]  This is all just a firestorm of insanity, but you also catch yourself kind of pinching yourself when eight people have been questioned, and they spend a lot of their time on me, and ask if I'm a Russian agent, or if they know anything about Russians.
[00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:34.048]  And you know, Daria doesn't want her last name or anything known, but I think at some point they're going to probably go there.
[00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:35.068]  They're not stupid.
[00:25:35.108 --> 00:25:39.230]  We need to bring out who she is beforehand because she's worked, served in the Army.
[00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.111]  One of the few women in the Army that served in the position she did.
[00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:44.892]  I know this from people that know her separately.
[00:25:44.912 --> 00:25:45.793]  She never even bragged about it.
[00:25:46.053 --> 00:25:50.955]  And we saw her honorable discharge and the work she'd done in communications and
[00:25:51.935 --> 00:25:55.818]  All the rest of it and her defense language school things and all her degrees and things.
[00:25:56.818 --> 00:25:59.480]  But then when I have a lot of other military people around here, they know who she is.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:08.326]  She's one of the few women who's ever served in one of the most elite multi-group organizations.
[00:26:11.008 --> 00:26:12.569]  Well, the only multi-group organization.
[00:26:13.209 --> 00:26:16.751]  So, that'll really fly well for you, I'm sure.
[00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:19.433]  That the only Russian we've got here is
[00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:28.887]  They got all these fake movies about women in the Navy SEALs and all this, and then the real women that have actually been in that kind of stuff, no one even knows who they are.
[00:26:29.267 --> 00:26:30.248]  And she doesn't want to be public.
[00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:33.170]  But I'm telling you, they're going to take that bite next.
[00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.972]  So we should probably just get all that out up front right now.
[00:26:37.072 --> 00:26:41.135]  Plus, everything she did was so classified, but you can imagine the book this lady could write.
[00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:47.639]  Over a hundred combat jumps, the whole nine yards, all the years in the Army, and all the things she did.
[00:26:47.659 --> 00:26:49.820]  That'd be amazing, wouldn't it?
[00:26:56.578 --> 00:26:57.058]  But that's it.
[00:26:57.379 --> 00:26:58.700]  That's the only Russian around here.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.221]  That's it.
[00:27:00.741 --> 00:27:01.842]  That's the Russian connection.
[00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:03.043]  Period.
[00:27:04.504 --> 00:27:05.565]  A lady you could write a book about.
[00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:08.247]  Serving this country in the military for many years.
[00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:11.090]  That's what you got?
[00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:16.434]  The real traitors are people like these globalists.
[00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:18.796]  Like Halperin, everybody.
[00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:21.398]  Trying to infiltrate the Trump campaign, trying to get
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.360]  And then what happens?
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.881]  They indict him for lying to the FBI.
[00:27:52.176 --> 00:27:54.599]  We got Roger Stone coming up in the next two segments.
[00:27:57.462 --> 00:27:58.783]  We're going to get an announcement by him.
[00:27:59.484 --> 00:28:01.786]  We're going to get Ted Malik to pop on with his take on this.
[00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:04.669]  He's been grabbed and crushed by the FBI, had his electronics taken.
[00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:09.114]  And then we're going to move forward and Roger's going to host the
[00:28:11.124 --> 00:28:37.405]  majority of the second hour today so this is all coming up ladies and gentlemen but this is an attempt to overthrow the election of Trump and your will and your vote telling you you're an idiot you're a rube you voted for a Russian back candidate when there's zero not one scintilla of truth to any of that and that's what they're doing
[00:28:40.146 --> 00:28:51.238]  Here's the issue, and I've told Roger this off-air, and I'll tell him on-air, and he doesn't like me saying it, because I know his wife's watching, but Roger, I'll say it, this Mueller specialty, they're not going to let you ever get to trial.
[00:28:51.378 --> 00:28:53.280]  They're going to indict you, and they're going to try to kill you.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:59.407]  The only way to expose it is to talk about the fact you're never going to commit suicide, but stay there.
[00:29:03.857 --> 00:29:16.984]  Now, joining me is Phil Labonte from All That Remains, a band that I know that many InfoWars listeners, many Alex Jones fans are going to be huge, huge devotees to.
[00:29:17.684 --> 00:29:18.905]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:29:19.045 --> 00:29:29.970]  Now, you are not one of the singers, one of the members of the metal community who is advocating for gun control, and you're coming in for a bit of criticism as a result.
[00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.711]  What happened to you?
[00:29:32.485 --> 00:29:33.085]  No, I do not.
[00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:35.807]  I do not advocate for gun control.
[00:29:37.407 --> 00:29:54.215]  In light of the Florida shooting, you know, a lot of people reacted emotionally, which is understandable, and there's a lot of people making calls for gun control, but they don't really elaborate what they're asking for.
[00:29:54.295 --> 00:29:57.697]  So I think that a lot of the breakdown between people that would
[00:29:58.337 --> 00:30:02.998]  Be considered on my side and people that would be considered on the other side.
[00:30:03.038 --> 00:30:05.619]  A lot of the breakdown is trying to understand each other.
[00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:16.182]  So I made a short video that was trying to explain why after these shootings there isn't just an instant law passed that'll just fix the problem.
[00:30:17.794 --> 00:30:21.056]  If there is a law passed, that law is going to come with problems.
[00:30:21.096 --> 00:30:29.341]  And so I put up the video and there is a metal blog that has had an issue with me for a long time because I just won't go away apparently.
[00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:36.486]  20 years of being in the same band and 10 years of these guys dogging me because I won't stop making music.
[00:30:37.847 --> 00:30:40.348]  It's basically the history of it.
[00:30:40.528 --> 00:30:50.513]  You mean to tell me that the inflamed objections of social justice warriors have not been enough to turn you off your lifelong passion and your career?
[00:30:50.994 --> 00:30:52.054]  Good heavens!
[00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:56.897]  There's me thinking you would crumble and fall over like a pack of jokers!
[00:30:57.057 --> 00:31:02.119]  I do understand that there is a lot of pressure from the media, from
[00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:09.745]  You know, so there is a lot of social pressure to have the correct opinions, the politically correct opinions.
[00:31:10.306 --> 00:31:21.614]  And when you're dealing with something like this particular shooting and guns in general, I think that it's hard to come up with an actual answer.
[00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:26.678]  So when you're kind of expected to say something on it and you don't,
[00:31:26.698 --> 00:31:27.639]  Is that what they say?
[00:31:56.698 --> 00:31:57.109]  Situation.
[00:32:01.284 --> 00:32:03.345]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:32:03.565 --> 00:32:04.905]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:32:05.146 --> 00:32:08.667]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:16.770]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:21.792]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:32:21.952 --> 00:32:27.414]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:32:27.754 --> 00:32:35.297]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:32:35.517 --> 00:32:39.979]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:45.981]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:32:46.121 --> 00:32:47.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:24.885 --> 00:33:29.428]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:29.749 --> 00:33:38.655]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:42.286]  Yeah.
[00:33:50.399 --> 00:34:01.065]  Well, Roger Stone has been making the rounds on the big Sunday morning news shows because the word is he's going to be indicted very, very soon.
[00:34:01.085 --> 00:34:06.248]  That's the NBC News headline at the top of DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:09.910]  And he says he's ready for the phony indictment, ready to fight it.
[00:34:10.391 --> 00:34:12.011]  Now, I learned Saturday morning
[00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:16.955]  That on Friday, six people had been grabbed up by the FBI.
[00:34:17.395 --> 00:34:21.317]  Some cases literally physically grabbed and taken in and interrogated for a full day or longer.
[00:34:22.598 --> 00:34:25.100]  Then we learned it was 8 today.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.703]  Roger has a lot of information that he is ready
[00:34:31.249 --> 00:34:36.874]  To break down here on air because this is an attempt to overturn the duly elected President of the United States.
[00:34:36.894 --> 00:34:48.925]  We'll get Ted Malik to pop in about the FBI scooping him up as well and how that ties in to what's happening with Professor Stefan Halper, who last Sunday, Roger Stone exclusively outed here.
[00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:53.509]  But when the New York Times broke it on Friday, five days later, zero credit!
[00:34:54.210 --> 00:35:00.797]  All they do is say we're fake news because they can't stand the fact that we continue to break all the major news.
[00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.454]  Now, since I mentioned this earlier, let me get to this and then to Roger.
[00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:12.137]  Judge Jeanine Pirro is on fire as usual.
[00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:16.081]  She reportedly has been meeting with the President saying, you must go after Sessions.
[00:35:16.421 --> 00:35:17.242]  You're the President.
[00:35:17.502 --> 00:35:18.624]  It's dereliction of duty.
[00:35:18.924 --> 00:35:22.247]  Rosenstein set up his own little special office, tripped you into signing it.
[00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:23.709]  You can unsign that, sir.
[00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:27.862]  They are involved in dereliction of duty.
[00:35:27.922 --> 00:35:33.188]  And she says that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the most dangerous man in America.
[00:35:33.228 --> 00:35:33.569]  That's right.
[00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:42.359]  Mueller's this globalist puppet, fixer, famous for setting up patsies who then mysteriously die in the anthrax case and others.
[00:35:42.439 --> 00:35:45.263]  Covering up 9-11, the Saudi involvement, the standout.
[00:35:46.192 --> 00:35:47.973]  But it's Sessions enabling it all.
[00:35:48.033 --> 00:35:55.759]  But by extension, Trump becomes the most dangerous man to himself and to the country if he doesn't take action.
[00:35:55.799 --> 00:36:03.605]  And Roger Stone has incredibly laid all this out with amazing precision, exactly as it would unfold.
[00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:05.786]  And now Giuliani's giving him the same advice.
[00:36:06.727 --> 00:36:08.008]  That Roger's been giving the president.
[00:36:08.408 --> 00:36:08.969]  Don't do it.
[00:36:09.029 --> 00:36:09.569]  It's a trap.
[00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:11.551]  They're never going to end the investigation in December.
[00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:12.812]  They're not going to end it in April.
[00:36:13.072 --> 00:36:14.073]  You're being lied to.
[00:36:14.334 --> 00:36:15.895]  They're preparing it for the midterms.
[00:36:16.135 --> 00:36:17.496]  This is to overturn your election.
[00:36:17.736 --> 00:36:23.882]  Well, Judge Jeanine has come out and said the most dangerous man in America is Jeff Sessions, and I agree.
[00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.944]  It doesn't matter whether he's been compromised or what it is.
[00:36:27.365 --> 00:36:30.888]  You've got completely rogue Clinton operatives, all of them,
[00:36:31.588 --> 00:36:39.579]  Running around like maniacs, Clinton-Obama people, illegally spying, lying to Congress about it, getting caught, doing all of this.
[00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:43.644]  Now it's all come out they had physical moles trying to plant Russian breadcrumbs.
[00:36:43.864 --> 00:36:44.946]  They were there to frame up.
[00:36:45.386 --> 00:36:46.968]  Not a mole, but a frame-up mole.
[00:36:47.813 --> 00:36:48.654]  Delivering the goods.
[00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:49.634]  They got caught.
[00:36:50.154 --> 00:36:51.175]  All the illegal spying.
[00:36:51.215 --> 00:36:52.696]  Now they admit they were spying on Trump Tower.
[00:36:52.936 --> 00:36:53.877]  They lied to Congress!
[00:36:53.897 --> 00:36:54.477]  Comey did!
[00:36:54.777 --> 00:36:55.758]  We have them!
[00:36:56.418 --> 00:37:01.361]  These are arrogant people that thought they were in power forever, who thought they were invincible.
[00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:02.762]  So, here is the judge.
[00:37:02.782 --> 00:37:08.826]  I'm gonna go right to Roger Stone, who's going to be hosting the entire second hour himself.
[00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:11.648]  Right now, let's go to the most dangerous man in America.
[00:37:12.572 --> 00:37:27.181]  Is that the single most dangerous person to the agenda of President Trump, the Republican Party, and ultimately to all Americans, is the Attorney General of the United States himself, Jeff Sessions.
[00:37:27.742 --> 00:37:40.350]  The man has done nothing to make anyone responsible for the blatant corruption, the unmistakable perjury, the in-your-face obstruction of our laws that we've seen play out every day.
[00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:48.238]  He has fought the release of telling documents that would put an end to this horrible period in America's political history.
[00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:54.926]  Documents that would make clear that the criminals in this attempt to overthrow an American president.
[00:37:55.486 --> 00:38:01.753]  He's even argued that he doesn't want to release records of Hillary because she's now a private citizen.
[00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:09.037]  This man has done nothing to create confidence that wrongdoers will be accountable, answerable.
[00:38:09.397 --> 00:38:16.080]  He has done nothing to create confidence on the part of the American people in our system of justice.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:24.404]  And with all the power and might of the Department of Justice behind him, he continues to do nothing.
[00:38:24.964 --> 00:38:28.046]  He refuses to take them out in cuffs.
[00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:50.179]  The most powerful prosecutor in the world, the man who holds the scales of justice in his hands, hides behind the coattails of a Rod Rosenstein, a man we've never even heard of, who is in fact behind all of Jeff Sessions' decision, who is in fact running our Department of Justice.
[00:38:51.226 --> 00:39:04.749]  The man who has the honor to carry the prefix United States Attorney General before his name, Jeff Sessions, is indeed the most dangerous man in America.
[00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:13.995]  True words have never been spoken, but if we're dumb enough to go along with this, that makes us the most dangerous person in America.
[00:39:14.015 --> 00:39:21.582]  And that's the old thing of, oh, you think somebody's gonna try to kill you so you don't care about your own life and eat a bunch of red meat and drink a bunch of whiskey and then you end up having a heart attack.
[00:39:21.862 --> 00:39:22.803]  You kind of killed yourself.
[00:39:23.623 --> 00:39:24.725]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:39:24.805 --> 00:39:26.446]  Is Trump going to move against these people?
[00:39:26.507 --> 00:39:30.531]  Ron Rosenstein is a completely rogue, out-of-control criminal.
[00:39:30.871 --> 00:39:37.778]  They've caught, the entire operation's been caught from pillar to post, manufacturing everything, and now they're moving steadily ahead with Mueller.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:51.331]  Closing in, this is in the Associated Press, on Roger Stone and the President, and in the middle of it, now suddenly, questions of all eight people grabbed this week, questions about Alex Jones.
[00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:55.274]  We're going to break in three minutes, but where should we start in this historic narrative?
[00:39:55.294 --> 00:39:59.898]  Because again, I've been saying Russiagate's a diversion until they make their move.
[00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:03.782]  Now, they're making their move right now, Roger Stone.
[00:40:05.014 --> 00:40:07.436]  Well, Alex, I think it's very, very clear.
[00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:10.218]  They need to silence Roger Stone.
[00:40:10.358 --> 00:40:12.380]  They need to silence Alex Jones.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:20.767]  We are a beacon of truth, and from the beginning, we have exposed the corruption of Ron Rosenstein, the corruption of Jeff Sessions,
[00:40:21.427 --> 00:40:23.909]  The corruption of the Mueller probe.
[00:40:24.229 --> 00:40:34.216]  We've highlighted Mr. Mueller's role in the Anthrax scandal, in the 9-11 scandal, in the Whitey Bulger scandal.
[00:40:34.556 --> 00:40:39.719]  We have called for the resignation, pardon me, the firing of Mr. Rosenstein.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:49.546]  We have outlined in great detail the involvement of Robert Mueller, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe
[00:40:50.206 --> 00:40:57.490]  In Uranium One, the largest multi-billion dollar treasonous crime in American history.
[00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:01.633]  The MSNBC headline is misleading.
[00:41:02.113 --> 00:41:13.380]  I didn't say I was prepared to be indicted but I did say that I understand the awesome power of a federal prosecutor to conjure up
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:27.790]  Offenses when they can find no Russian collusion, no trafficking of documents with WikiLeaks, and no connection to the disclosure of John Podesta's pathetic emails.
[00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:30.752]  So the deep state grows restless.
[00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:34.735]  Jones, Stone, we've got to shut them up.
[00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:36.617]  We've got to get them to stop
[00:41:37.197 --> 00:41:40.679]  Broadcasting the truth right there at Infowars.com.
[00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:42.880]  That is what this is all about.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.282]  Well, I want to walk through what has not been reported yet.
[00:41:46.922 --> 00:41:52.444]  And I love how when you report on what the FBI does to you, the media ignores it when it's here until they report it five days later.
[00:41:52.465 --> 00:41:53.925]  It's always the same formula.
[00:41:54.646 --> 00:41:58.948]  But even alternative media ignores it, which is fine, but it's just insane that they do this.
[00:41:58.988 --> 00:42:01.269]  But just like you exposed last Sunday,
[00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:03.631]  We knew it, of course, months before.
[00:42:03.731 --> 00:42:07.534]  You wrote about it in your book years ago about the Bush crime family that came out several years ago.
[00:42:07.594 --> 00:42:13.819]  But you told me months ago it was Cambridge professor, Anglophile, Stefan Halper, a U.S.
[00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:14.320]  citizen.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.903]  And now, oh, the New York Times broke it on Friday, Roger.
[00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:21.292]  It's amazing, Alex.
[00:42:21.432 --> 00:42:23.894]  The New York Times is now trying to spin this.
[00:42:24.634 --> 00:42:30.598]  Oh, the FBI infiltrated the Trump campaign because they were looking for evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:42:31.018 --> 00:42:33.260]  How stupid do they think the American people are?
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:42.986]  The FBI infiltrated the Trump campaign to plant claims of Russian collusion for a later takedown of Donald Trump.
[00:42:43.407 --> 00:42:46.008]  Stefan Halper has violated the law.
[00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:49.931]  If we had a real attorney general, he'd be the one who's about to be
[00:42:50.853 --> 00:42:52.717]  And by the way, it's been in congressional hearings.
[00:42:52.817 --> 00:42:56.145]  He's been caught before infiltrating campaigns for sabotage.
[00:42:56.405 --> 00:42:56.966]  We'll be back.
[00:42:56.986 --> 00:42:57.427]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.248 --> 00:43:07.253]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:10.236]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[00:43:10.836 --> 00:43:14.299]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:18.823]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:22.505]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:43:23.406 --> 00:43:33.648]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:42.911]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:53.114]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:44:01.198 --> 00:44:04.399]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:06.159]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:18.182]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:44:18.882 --> 00:44:23.963]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:44:24.763 --> 00:44:34.026]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:44:34.246 --> 00:44:38.887]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:44:42.068 --> 00:44:43.389]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:53.413]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:44:53.533 --> 00:44:55.673]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:44:56.214 --> 00:45:01.096]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:45:01.176 --> 00:45:03.857]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.

[00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:11.240]  This is the essence
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.961]  Of InfoWars.

[00:46:08.037 --> 00:46:12.382]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:46:12.822 --> 00:46:14.703]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:46:58.529 --> 00:47:00.471]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:04.551 --> 00:47:09.115]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:28.494]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:46.041]  So, it was in the New York Post, the Associated Press, McClatchy, in April of last year that the FBI, at the behest of Democrats, had opened a criminal investigation of Infowars for us being funded, not just bots, which is made up, but colluding with the Russians.
[00:47:46.902 --> 00:47:54.825]  And a year and a half later, all they could find, or a year and three months later, is, oh, we uploaded something to our Facebook page from Switzerland.
[00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.686]  Yeah, we have a reporter, Dan Lyman, there.
[00:47:56.926 --> 00:47:57.626]  He's an American.
[00:47:57.846 --> 00:47:59.087]  He's married to a European woman.
[00:47:59.787 --> 00:48:00.887]  Switzerland's really nice.
[00:48:01.488 --> 00:48:04.208]  We're setting up reporters in Europe, so we're 24 hours a day.
[00:48:04.608 --> 00:48:06.549]  We're a news organization, just like you.
[00:48:07.269 --> 00:48:14.451]  But at a sick level, I feel good that these globalist criminals are lying about me, and the FBI's obsessing on me, and Roger Stone.
[00:48:14.511 --> 00:48:22.334]  Knowing we're patriots, and knowing there's nothing there, you still have a little nagging feeling like, well, I'm sure Stone and Trump are good, but who knows, there could be something.
[00:48:22.554 --> 00:48:28.456]  But then, when they go after you, and you know there's no collusion, and you know it's the
[00:48:30.603 --> 00:48:34.285]  Obama's and the Clintons and Mueller who are in bed with him.
[00:48:34.586 --> 00:48:38.828]  It just shows you what sick freaks they are and you know at the end of the day they're going to fall.
[00:48:38.868 --> 00:48:39.309]  Now, Roger.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.041]  I want you to lay this out.
[00:48:41.061 --> 00:48:44.003]  You're going to host the next hour and really go through it all piece by piece.
[00:48:44.043 --> 00:48:47.005]  But this is the historic move you've been dead on so far.
[00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:47.785]  They're making their move.
[00:48:48.105 --> 00:48:49.706]  Tell folks what happened this week.
[00:48:50.087 --> 00:49:00.273]  Some of the eight people that got scooped up, what you've learned from them, what you've learned from your lawyers as they try to go in and threaten people to then, I guess, basically flip against you and make something up.
[00:49:00.874 --> 00:49:06.778]  Again, not a Russia connection, but a process, a taxes that didn't get paid, a crooked toenail.
[00:49:07.478 --> 00:49:09.920]  You know, maybe maybe you didn't brush your teeth once.
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.283]  I mean, we know the program.
[00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:21.137]  Well, Alex, obviously there are some limits in what I can discuss, but let me be as candid here as I possibly can.
[00:49:21.832 --> 00:49:26.637]  The Mueller inquiry has come up empty-handed on the question of Russian collusion.
[00:49:27.138 --> 00:49:31.422]  In my case, they can foster no connection between me and the Russians.
[00:49:31.783 --> 00:49:41.213]  They've come up empty-handed on the idea that I got allegedly hacked emails from WikiLeaks or from the Russians and passed it on to Donald Trump.
[00:49:41.793 --> 00:49:47.440]  Or that I got anything from the alleged hacking of the DNC and passed it on to Julian Assange.
[00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:50.624]  While we're at it, no I didn't dine with Julian Assange.
[00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:51.766]  I've never met with him.
[00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:53.368]  I've never spoken to him.
[00:49:53.768 --> 00:50:00.056]  My testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was entirely candid, was complete and truthful.
[00:50:00.496 --> 00:50:07.938]  The congenital liar Adam Schiff goes on Meet the Press today and says, otherwise, but it's Schiff who is the lawyer, liar.
[00:50:07.978 --> 00:50:14.380]  And by the way, Congressman, why were you having a fundraiser sponsored by a Ukrainian arms dealer while you're at it?
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.700]  Could you answer that for us?
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.981]  So what's happened here, Alex, in the last week?
[00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:23.230]  At least eight of my former or current associates.
[00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:31.736]  In some cases, young people whose names, no, I'm not going to list here because I don't want their names to be dragged through the mud.
[00:50:31.836 --> 00:50:33.337]  They know nothing.
[00:50:33.757 --> 00:50:38.981]  They can be of no value to the government, but they terrorize these people.
[00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:49.367]  You're going to a grand jury immediately unless you say Roger Stone did X. It is part and parcel of Mueller's M.O.
[00:50:50.108 --> 00:50:54.871]  I've already said Caputo, so it's okay to get into what he told you they said about me.
[00:50:55.691 --> 00:50:57.412]  Yes, but I'm going to get into this right now.
[00:50:57.873 --> 00:51:02.556]  At least eight people have now been asked about Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:03.096]  They asked
[00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.329]  What is Stone's relationship with Alex Jones?
[00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:09.291]  What does Stone do for Alex Jones?
[00:51:09.871 --> 00:51:14.014]  What is Alex Jones like, as if they would know?
[00:51:14.374 --> 00:51:19.457]  How much does Stone make at InfoWars, where I do a show for an hour a day?
[00:51:19.637 --> 00:51:22.499]  The War Room, 5 o'clock Eastern, with Owen Schroyer.
[00:51:22.819 --> 00:51:23.720]  A terrific show.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.661]  If you haven't tuned in, please do.
[00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:29.762]  You know, Alex, in all honesty, I would urge you to do what I have done.
[00:51:30.082 --> 00:51:31.863]  Have your lawyers standing by.
[00:51:32.303 --> 00:51:34.603]  They want to shut InfoWars up.
[00:51:34.683 --> 00:51:43.486]  They try to do it every day through their campaign of internet censorship, through their bogus lawsuits, their harassment lawsuits.
[00:51:44.347 --> 00:51:53.375]  And they will do anything, including scooping both of us up if necessary, to stop our relentless drumbeat in the interests of truth.
[00:51:53.835 --> 00:51:55.957]  Am I expecting to be indicted?
[00:51:55.977 --> 00:51:56.938]  I never said that.
[00:51:57.499 --> 00:51:58.440]  Here's what I do know.
[00:51:59.315 --> 00:52:13.240]  If they should make a legal move against me, it will open the door to raising the question in court of the illegal FISA warrant that the New York Times says was issued against me in 2016.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.562]  Now, under the FISA law, a U.S.
[00:52:16.602 --> 00:52:27.826]  citizen can only have a FISA warrant levied against them if they are actively involved in espionage against the United States on behalf of a foreign power.
[00:52:28.386 --> 00:52:29.807]  That is not the case.
[00:52:30.267 --> 00:52:37.070]  In the Manafort case, the government refuses to admit in his discovery that he was the subject of surveillance.
[00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:48.975]  In the Russian case, the 13 Russians, who Mr. Mueller never expected to show up for trial, they're now demanding discovery in terms of his surveillance of them.
[00:52:49.555 --> 00:52:50.856]  And he has been completely wrong.
[00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:52.657]  Well, it's like all the fake lawsuits against us.
[00:52:52.917 --> 00:52:55.419]  When we win them, when they get thrown out, no news coverage of it.
[00:52:55.699 --> 00:52:57.120]  You just won the big defamation case.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.701]  They just threw out the Charlottesville.
[00:52:58.761 --> 00:52:59.661]  I guess they're going to re-enter it.
[00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:05.065]  Because it was literally written like a blind chimpanzee wrote it or something.
[00:53:05.605 --> 00:53:07.646]  I mean, it's next level how lazy they are.
[00:53:07.946 --> 00:53:11.088]  But still, they're so confident in their activities.
[00:53:11.148 --> 00:53:11.849]  It's just crazy.
[00:53:11.909 --> 00:53:15.271]  But, I mean, do they think the public is going to buy
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:23.183]  Now as they zero in on the final few people, they even admit that in the news, that's Trump, Roger Stone, and then Alex Jones.
[00:53:23.464 --> 00:53:28.867]  I mean, that is completely insane that anyone would ever buy into that.
[00:53:28.907 --> 00:53:33.350]  This is, this is, Mueller is on tarmacs with illegal uranium transfers.
[00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:37.593]  Mueller is on board of Russian companies where he just gets paid cash.
[00:53:37.853 --> 00:53:42.176]  Hillary gets hundreds of millions to sell out our strategic stockpile of uranium.
[00:53:42.256 --> 00:53:43.297]  I mean, that's treason.
[00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:46.339]  And then they point at you, a famous anti-communist,
[00:53:47.039 --> 00:53:50.422]  Protégé of Richard Nixon was a protégé of Eisenhower.
[00:53:51.543 --> 00:53:55.926]  In the 80s you helped round up a Russian spy network for the FBI in DC.
[00:53:56.446 --> 00:53:57.046]  This is like...
[00:53:57.932 --> 00:54:00.074]  Claiming George Washington's a redcoat!
[00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:05.759]  I mean, saying that I am anti-American and that I'm a frickin' traitor is ridiculous!
[00:54:06.059 --> 00:54:09.483]  It is so... and I... it's beyond resentment.
[00:54:09.903 --> 00:54:19.372]  The fact that Mueller and Obama and Hillary and all them are so arrogant, Roger, that they think that that is gonna fly, that that dog is gonna hide.
[00:54:19.632 --> 00:54:22.875]  That is an insult to the intelligence of the American people.
[00:54:23.035 --> 00:54:23.536]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:36.292]  And in every case, Alex, the eight people who were interviewed by the FBI wanted to know if they had copies of correspondence between Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:54:36.933 --> 00:54:38.975]  I mean, this is Kafkaesque.
[00:54:39.015 --> 00:54:40.456]  This is not America.
[00:54:41.037 --> 00:54:44.080]  This is some weird caricature of justice.
[00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:47.624]  And I really believe this is all about silencing us.
[00:54:48.248 --> 00:54:52.671]  They don't want us to get to the heart of this question of illegal surveillance.
[00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:54.353]  I was about to say, how big is it?
[00:54:54.373 --> 00:54:56.874]  Because I've got a limited team, but we're going to do this tomorrow.
[00:54:58.275 --> 00:55:01.678]  We gave speeches at the mall about how they were illegally surveilling Trump.
[00:55:01.738 --> 00:55:05.601]  We've done a hundred shows or more about the surveillance we were dead on.
[00:55:05.661 --> 00:55:07.262]  We got the secret NSA files.
[00:55:07.582 --> 00:55:08.643]  No media coverage of that.
[00:55:08.703 --> 00:55:09.384]  We proved it.
[00:55:09.584 --> 00:55:11.325]  It was all our private numbers and the President's.
[00:55:12.126 --> 00:55:16.249]  And now they just think we're going to forget about that as they're caught
[00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:18.991]  Doing exactly what we said they did.
[00:55:19.311 --> 00:55:25.958]  That's why they want to shut us down, because we all deserve, you deserve like 50 Pulitzer Prizes, I deserve 10, Matt Drudge deserves 100.
[00:55:26.018 --> 00:55:29.181]  I mean the truth is we're the real people breaking it all!
[00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:31.643]  That's why they're so pissed, because they don't control us!
[00:55:32.756 --> 00:55:45.581]  Well, I'm very proud of the fact that it was InfoWars, kind of concurrently with the Daily Caller and the great reporting of Chuck Ross there, that exposed the FBI spy who was infiltrated inside the Trump campaign.
[00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:48.983]  And it's not about credit, but you wrote about him a few years ago.
[00:55:49.663 --> 00:55:53.247]  Well, I didn't want to go with this a few months ago when you were ready, just because I don't want to get sued.
[00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:57.451]  The guy lives in England, where they have laws where, you know, you can say the sky's blue, they can sue you.
[00:55:57.471 --> 00:56:00.173]  But yeah, I saw that they were saying maybe he's him.
[00:56:00.494 --> 00:56:01.755]  I said, hey, you know it's him.
[00:56:02.055 --> 00:56:04.578]  You said, yeah, now's the time to launch the attacks we did last Sunday.
[00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:05.719]  The point is, we broke it.
[00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.711]  Again, InfoWars.
[00:56:09.051 --> 00:56:10.691]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:56:10.952 --> 00:56:18.875]  I first exposed Steph Halper in my book, The Bush Crime Family, which you can get, by the way, at the InfoWars.com store right now.
[00:56:20.055 --> 00:56:22.496]  But it is all out there to see, and you're exactly right.
[00:56:22.956 --> 00:56:31.200]  He is the same Bush operative who stole the Jimmy Carter briefing book and delivered it to Vice Presidential candidate George Bush.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.241]  In fact, George Bush was running that operation.
[00:56:34.701 --> 00:56:42.646]  He is a long-time CIA operative, and he is busted thanks to the fearless reporting here at InfoWars.
[00:56:43.026 --> 00:56:44.407]  We had it first.
[00:56:44.907 --> 00:56:46.868]  I also give credit to Chuck Ross.
[00:56:46.928 --> 00:56:50.010]  We essentially broke the story at pretty much the same time.
[00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:56.033]  Ross admits that he first learned who Halpern was by reading my book, The Bush Crime Family.
[00:56:56.173 --> 00:56:58.815]  And Daley Culler's awesome.
[00:56:58.835 --> 00:57:00.316]  Tucker Carlson that owns it's awesome.
[00:57:01.056 --> 00:57:02.418]  We're not trying to, like, get credit.
[00:57:02.498 --> 00:57:11.187]  We're just sick of how we break literally half the big stories when it comes to this and then we get no credit and they go, oh, you're fake news, you're fake news, you're fake news.
[00:57:12.067 --> 00:57:13.309]  It's absolute crud.
[00:57:14.924 --> 00:57:17.565]  And it's a knee slapper, the spin they've come up with.
[00:57:17.805 --> 00:57:23.067]  Oh, the FBI infiltrated Trump's campaign so they could look for Russian collusion.
[00:57:23.147 --> 00:57:33.111]  No, they infiltrated the Trump campaign so they could plant evidence of faux Russian collusion as part of their insurance policy.
[00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:34.831]  And by the way, I'm not even defending the FBI.
[00:57:37.458 --> 00:57:38.259]  You're right, you're right.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.122]  I'm not even defending the FBI.
[00:57:40.142 --> 00:57:42.825]  When we come back in two minutes though, I'm gonna break down the rest of the story.
[00:57:43.286 --> 00:57:44.528]  You notice these are spy groups.
[00:57:44.568 --> 00:57:46.730]  They're just using the FBI as their front.
[00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:49.094]  The FBI is not even who's doing this.
[00:57:51.314 --> 00:57:52.035]  I'm so excited.
[00:57:52.055 --> 00:58:01.681]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:07.445]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:58:07.765 --> 00:58:10.567]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:19.533]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:58:21.654 --> 00:58:40.751]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:42.552]  It is amazing!
[00:58:43.954 --> 00:58:48.918]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:58:50.717 --> 00:58:58.404]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:58:59.265 --> 00:59:03.328]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:06.171]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:59:06.972 --> 00:59:10.075]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:59:11.587 --> 00:59:23.731]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:59:24.432 --> 00:59:39.477]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:44.182]  Find out for yourself today at InfowarsStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[00:59:44.743 --> 00:59:46.465]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:59:46.485 --> 00:59:48.728]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[00:59:48.768 --> 00:59:58.339]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.766]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:18.287 --> 01:00:19.750]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.611 --> 01:00:22.795]  Now, Roger has wanted me to host with him this hour.
[01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:23.556]  He likes the banner.
[01:00:24.077 --> 01:00:28.183]  He likes taking calls, too, but I distract him when he just is allowed to roll.
[01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:32.401]  He will get through all the points that you need to hear the stuff we've been privately talking about.
[01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:41.708]  You need to know all the different angles because they're making their move against the American voter, against the First Amendment, against Trump, against Infowars, against everybody.
[01:00:42.268 --> 01:00:43.910]  And they get us, they will get you all.
[01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.712]  So, Roger, you were making a great point, though.
[01:00:47.832 --> 01:00:54.917]  Via their illegal FISA court garbage, which the FISA court has come out and said it was illegal, they were lied to to issue these warrants.
[01:00:55.358 --> 01:00:58.060]  You've been spied on, Trump, myself, hundreds of others.
[01:00:59.221 --> 01:01:12.154]  And now they want parallel construction, which came out in court five years ago with the DEA and the NSA, where when they're illegally surveilling somebody, they then want to reconstruct it for a court case.
[01:01:13.638 --> 01:01:22.445]  And so they then subpoena a bunch of other people they know are in the emails to cover their tracks and make it look like that they actually did the investigation fair and square.
[01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:26.228]  And again, there's no Russia collusion in the biggest dragnet in world history.
[01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.949]  Biggest witch-hunt in world history.
[01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:29.310]  Trump is definitely right about that.
[01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.613]  So now it's just gonna be, what's the taxes done right here?
[01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:33.834]  What's the checkbook done right?
[01:01:34.214 --> 01:01:35.695]  And it's not even where you go to jail for that.
[01:01:36.976 --> 01:01:39.038]  It's, did you write somebody a check?
[01:01:39.418 --> 01:01:40.078]  I don't remember.
[01:01:40.098 --> 01:01:40.739]  Yeah, I think it was 5,000.
[01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:40.979]  It's 6,000?
[01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:41.820]  You go to prison.
[01:01:43.877 --> 01:01:48.700]  So you can't talk to the FBI just because if you don't say it exactly right, they'll set you up.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:56.265]  And even if you do, in the case of the third guy they set up for the anthrax attack, it turned out he turned over all the samples and it wasn't him and they tested him.
[01:01:56.626 --> 01:01:57.246]  They didn't care.
[01:01:57.286 --> 01:01:59.668]  They said he didn't turn them over, but it's all come out in federal court now.
[01:02:00.068 --> 01:02:01.569]  So they are liars.
[01:02:01.709 --> 01:02:02.529]  They are criminals.
[01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:06.332]  Mueller is there because he's one of the dirtiest people in American history.
[01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:07.433]  He's a traitor.
[01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:08.393]  He hates the country.
[01:02:08.654 --> 01:02:09.734]  He works for the globalists.
[01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:12.136]  He works for the offshore system.
[01:02:12.156 --> 01:02:13.597]  So when we come back from this quick break,
[01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:23.650]  From a parallel construction, briefly here Roger, we're going to get into how does Trump strike back, the AG report coming out, why the globalists are so scared, why they've moved their timetable up.
[01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:31.421]  But the three minutes we have before break, let's get into parallel construction and the illegal wiretaps now confirmed, bigger than Watergate as President Trump has said.
[01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:33.871]  Well, Alex, you're exactly right.
[01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:36.052]  Look, I think I've been very consistent.
[01:02:36.192 --> 01:02:48.217]  For over a year, I have said that I believe that the Mueller team, since its inception, has already been in my emails, seen my text messages, monitored my phone calls.
[01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:48.617]  How?
[01:02:49.077 --> 01:02:50.778]  Through this illegal FISA warrant.
[01:02:50.858 --> 01:02:53.159]  Now, they won't want to admit that in court.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.205]  So, as in the case of Paul Manafort, they have to go get it from some third party.
[01:02:59.586 --> 01:03:04.311]  They can't say, we've got Roger Stone's emails between he and Alex Jones.
[01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:06.954]  They have to say they got it from someone else.
[01:03:07.054 --> 01:03:10.218]  That's the parallel construction that you speak of.
[01:03:10.968 --> 01:03:14.472]  The IG's report, I think, is the big enchilada.
[01:03:14.913 --> 01:03:17.055]  I think it comes within the next 10 days.
[01:03:17.516 --> 01:03:23.743]  There will be criminal indictments for people working on the Mueller team arising from this report.
[01:03:24.043 --> 01:03:28.008]  There will be criminal indictments from people working at the Justice Department.
[01:03:28.288 --> 01:03:36.914]  There will be criminal indictments of those in our intelligence agencies which have become political, have been politicized.
[01:03:36.994 --> 01:03:43.058]  Now, one guy who I think is in bigger trouble than anyone else, the psychopath John Brennan.
[01:03:43.638 --> 01:03:46.180]  The noose is tightening on him.
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.882]  This old codger's going to prison for the rest of his life.
[01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:51.063]  They're busted.
[01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.616]  This is a two-part prong.
[01:03:53.716 --> 01:03:56.218]  There's the surveillance and then there's the spying.
[01:03:56.298 --> 01:03:58.579]  When we come back, we're going to break it down.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:05.084]  In the meantime, I have to ask people to go to the Infowars store because they are trying to shut us down.
[01:04:05.184 --> 01:04:16.011]  This is about silencing Alex Jones, silencing Roger Stone, so they stop attacking the Deep State and this investigation and their illicit agenda.
[01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:17.912]  The president's figured this out.
[01:04:18.212 --> 01:04:20.313]  This isn't about charging him with a crime.
[01:04:20.734 --> 01:04:23.155]  This is about removing him from office.
[01:04:23.635 --> 01:04:31.540]  Only with a strong, vibrant, and robust InfoWars can we continue to bring you the news about what's really going on.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:31.920]  That's right.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.103]  The globalists recognize that InfoWars, with all of you, all our guests, was critical in the victory in 2016.
[01:04:37.463 --> 01:04:39.885]  They're trying to devastate us ahead of 2018 and 2020.
[01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:49.368]  We need the InfoWars attack ship of truth, up front, well fed, ready for the attack, expanding in the face of the enemy.
[01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:53.630]  Buy your war bonds today, getting great products you need at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:58.011]  If you don't, Soros, Hillary the Globalist, and Mueller will crush us.
[01:04:58.731 --> 01:05:00.412]  They're still destroyed already though.
[01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:05.506]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[01:05:05.807 --> 01:05:12.472]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[01:05:12.773 --> 01:05:16.916]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[01:05:17.987 --> 01:05:22.670]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[01:05:23.071 --> 01:05:24.071]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:35.279]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, org slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.

[01:06:14.578 --> 01:06:16.721]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:18.604]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.851]  Report's fine.
[01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:43.231]  Write it.
[01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:45.453]  If you're going to write an unfair report, write it.
[01:06:46.094 --> 01:06:47.035]  And we will combat it.
[01:06:47.315 --> 01:06:48.656]  We're ready to rip it apart.
[01:06:49.517 --> 01:06:52.220]  And we're ready to rip them apart, if that's what they want.
[01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:56.404]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[01:06:57.785 --> 01:06:59.647]  Rudy Giuliani, always great to see you.
[01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.328]  Thanks for coming in.
[01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.415]  So Stone was just on Ingram's program as well.
[01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:06.815]  They hate her because she's a patriot and fearless.
[01:07:07.376 --> 01:07:08.536]  Really some heroes have emerged.
[01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:13.777]  Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, your good friend, and then of course Ingram.
[01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.898]  And that's who the left and Soros won off air.
[01:07:16.398 --> 01:07:17.758]  And everybody better understand this.
[01:07:18.739 --> 01:07:20.039]  The Wall Street Journal even reported
[01:07:21.883 --> 01:07:26.585]  If they can take out Infowars, they said this, I couldn't believe it, they will then shut everybody else down.
[01:07:26.945 --> 01:07:27.786]  This is the plan.
[01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:34.109]  So we're here hitting the barbed wire, exposing all this first, making it safe for others to cover it later.
[01:07:34.629 --> 01:07:35.429]  That's what we do.
[01:07:35.909 --> 01:07:37.130]  We're like the pebble in the pond.
[01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:47.275]  And so, Roz, you're taking over the next three segments for 45 minutes, but you have been on fire during the breaks and on air, and you don't just say things hoping they come true.
[01:07:47.335 --> 01:07:49.936]  You say the word is Trump's taking the gloves off,
[01:07:50.436 --> 01:08:01.526]  They've already reverse-engineered all the collusion, the inside games, the fraud, the moles trying to plant Russian breadcrumbs, and that major indictments are coming.
[01:08:01.546 --> 01:08:02.607]  The Inspector General.
[01:08:02.847 --> 01:08:08.533]  Let's talk about the devastating Inspector General report, and I know you've talked to some folks.
[01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:12.819]  Uh, that have, uh, got some intel for us on a first look.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.383]  Let's give people a first look, the data dump.
[01:08:15.443 --> 01:08:24.077]  Some of the things we were talking about, some other sources have confirmed that they're really running scared right now, which makes the deep state that's left very, very dangerous.
[01:08:25.009 --> 01:08:28.171]  This is why they're so desperate to silence us, Alex.
[01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:31.132]  Look, they would like to gag me, but let me be very clear.
[01:08:31.753 --> 01:08:36.616]  Should they succeed in legally gagging me, Michael Caputo will speak on my behalf.
[01:08:36.796 --> 01:08:40.118]  My attorney, Tyler Nixon, will speak on my behalf.
[01:08:40.278 --> 01:08:40.778]  My wife,
[01:08:41.198 --> 01:08:43.541]  Media Stone will speak on my behalf.
[01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:47.386]  My longtime associate, Kristen Davis, will speak on my behalf.
[01:08:47.746 --> 01:08:50.009]  You will not be able to kneecap the truth.
[01:08:50.089 --> 01:08:52.853]  We will talk about your phony FIATSA warrant.
[01:08:52.893 --> 01:08:55.116]  We will talk about your illegal surveillance.
[01:08:55.436 --> 01:08:57.098]  We will talk about your spying.
[01:08:57.138 --> 01:08:59.962]  We'll be talking about your attempts to terrorize
[01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:02.463]  Are the people who work for us.
[01:09:02.523 --> 01:09:05.424]  We'll talk about your efforts to take down Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.764 --> 01:09:09.446]  We'll talk about your efforts to silence InfoWars.
[01:09:10.186 --> 01:09:11.426]  This is extraordinary.
[01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:15.548]  Between the use of a fabricated dossier.
[01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:40.527]  As the underpinning legal rationale for the surveillance, the use of the authority and capability of the state to spy on the Republican candidate for president's campaign, Donald Trump, and the infiltration of the Trump campaign by the FBI to spy and plant phony evidence of Russian collusion, they are busted!
[01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:43.150]  I'm sorry, this makes Watergate look like
[01:09:44.002 --> 01:09:45.583]  A second-rate burglary.
[01:09:46.524 --> 01:09:49.806]  It is the greatest single political scandal in American history.
[01:09:49.826 --> 01:09:50.486]  I agree with you.
[01:09:50.546 --> 01:09:55.790]  So as the wheels came off a long time ago, but now it's exploding and they've all been caught lying to Congress.
[01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.892]  They've all been caught paying their families off to create fake dossiers.
[01:09:59.212 --> 01:10:01.194]  They've all been caught lying about illegal spying.
[01:10:01.274 --> 01:10:06.717]  I mean, there's so much perjury, so many lies, so much arrogance by these dirtbags.
[01:10:06.737 --> 01:10:08.498]  You can see Trump setting the trap for them.
[01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:10.680]  Now, what are they going to do though?
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.801]  Because I mean, they don't have much time left.
[01:10:14.282 --> 01:10:17.744]  Because I see even the Neocon National Review turning against him.
[01:10:18.124 --> 01:10:21.425]  I see Fox News that was kind of halfway against Trump now waking up.
[01:10:21.545 --> 01:10:26.647]  I see everybody getting Trump's delivering, the economy's turning around, we're getting peace deals, Trump's for real.
[01:10:27.007 --> 01:10:29.348]  I mean, I see Trump is winning.
[01:10:30.349 --> 01:10:36.711]  Well, a White House source told me on Friday that it appears that economic growth in the next quarter will actually hit 4%.
[01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:40.761]  The best that Barack Obama could ever do was 1.5%.
[01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:44.083]  Oh, please, in the last segment, just cover that.
[01:10:44.143 --> 01:10:45.024]  I forgot to tell you.
[01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:46.665]  Briefly, tell folks about that now.
[01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:47.506]  That is so huge.
[01:10:48.187 --> 01:10:51.950]  Well, a White House economist, who shall remain nameless, was almost giddy.
[01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:55.172]  4% economic growth is extraordinary.
[01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:59.675]  They told us that was literally... They said 3% was impossible.
[01:11:00.296 --> 01:11:02.838]  Couldn't be done, except for Donald Trump has done it.
[01:11:03.238 --> 01:11:05.340]  Alex, look for two things in the weeks ahead.
[01:11:06.284 --> 01:11:13.751]  Not only the IG report, which is going to be explosive, it is going to be political and legal dynamite.
[01:11:14.092 --> 01:11:17.895]  But also look for the decisions of Judge Ellis in Virginia.
[01:11:18.295 --> 01:11:19.997]  He's on to the deep state.
[01:11:20.337 --> 01:11:22.700]  He's on to Mr. Mueller.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.882]  He's on to the phony
[01:11:25.722 --> 01:11:30.848]  surveillance and FBI infiltration and spying on the Trump campaign.
[01:11:31.169 --> 01:11:38.337]  And I think this historic, brave, courageous judge is going to bust this thing wide open.
[01:11:38.437 --> 01:11:40.119]  I spoke to Paul Manafort yesterday.
[01:11:40.979 --> 01:11:42.279]  He's ready to go to trial.
[01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:47.000]  What he exposes about the government at trial will knock your socks off.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.061]  You see, they thought that he would fold.
[01:11:49.361 --> 01:11:51.781]  They thought they would never have to go to trial.
[01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:59.103]  Notice Mr. Mueller trying to now delay the trial of the 13 Russians that he indicted to get a headline.
[01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:00.824]  They're ready to go to trial.
[01:12:01.164 --> 01:12:02.804]  They want to know about their surveillance.
[01:12:03.124 --> 01:12:04.645]  But he doesn't want to play ball.
[01:12:05.005 --> 01:12:07.065]  This is why they are looking at you.
[01:12:07.386 --> 01:12:08.926]  This is why they are looking at me.
[01:12:09.286 --> 01:12:14.848]  This is why they may seek to fabricate or manufacture offenses against me.
[01:12:15.188 --> 01:12:17.469]  I never said I was preparing to be indicted.
[01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:22.151]  That is MSNBC Ari Melber BS.
[01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:25.132]  This guy David Korn with Mother Jones.
[01:12:25.592 --> 01:12:26.733]  That's the problem with crap.
[01:12:26.853 --> 01:12:28.354]  It often has corn in it.
[01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:30.535]  This guy is a congenital liar.
[01:12:30.895 --> 01:12:33.957]  Continually saying Stone had information on Wikileaks.
[01:12:34.297 --> 01:12:36.118]  Stone was trafficking with the Russians.
[01:12:36.198 --> 01:12:37.999]  No, David, you have nothing.
[01:12:38.259 --> 01:12:39.480]  You're a BS artist.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.941]  I just called you an asshole.
[01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:48.888]  We were all trying to get him on, and then I was bummed out that he was on the New York Times and CNN before they banned him.
[01:12:48.908 --> 01:12:50.730]  I was like, why doesn't Assange come on?
[01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:52.011]  We all sent emails.
[01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:55.394]  We all tried to have contacts say what's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:12:55.614 --> 01:12:58.277]  Obviously any reporter wants that, but the idea that
[01:12:59.198 --> 01:13:03.199]  We were coordinating with him when he won't even talk to us, because we're the real media.
[01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:04.620]  Even Assange treats us like crap.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.780]  That's what they don't get.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:25.006]  They always think the establishment's what's cool, and then they spin that into that A, he's a Russian agent when there's no evidence of that, and then by extension, we're coordinating with Assange when I have attacked Assange a year and a half ago and called him Hillary Clinton's you-know-what plug because he treats us like crap and won't talk to us.
[01:13:25.286 --> 01:13:25.987]  It's the opposite.
[01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:26.727]  We're on record.
[01:13:27.347 --> 01:13:32.072]  Assange is all locked up because he listened to the establishment and thought he could convince them.
[01:13:32.372 --> 01:13:34.014]  He should have come on shows like this.
[01:13:34.234 --> 01:13:41.702]  But the idea that we're running around with Guccifer 2.0 because you're on a message board going, please give me intel, that's what reporters do.
[01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.583]  Yeah, no, look, this is a joke.
[01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:49.268]  Our friend Jack Posobiec at One America News really pointed this out.
[01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:57.958]  Julian Assange went on CNN in June of 2016 and said, essentially, I've got the mother load on Hillary.
[01:13:58.378 --> 01:14:00.541]  So what we're guilty of, Alex, is...
[01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:03.265]  Watching CNN and believing it.
[01:14:16.965 --> 01:14:18.407]  Obviously, that was the big news.
[01:14:18.447 --> 01:14:19.948]  Of course we were all over WikiLeaks.
[01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:25.012]  The idea that we're Russian agents because like everybody else we were trying to get the latest scoop.
[01:14:25.732 --> 01:14:27.273]  I call everybody to come on.
[01:14:27.293 --> 01:14:29.955]  I mean, I've tried to get Vladimir Putin on.
[01:14:30.015 --> 01:14:31.476]  I've tried to get Obama on.
[01:14:31.497 --> 01:14:33.318]  Does that mean I support Obama?
[01:14:34.479 --> 01:14:36.981]  No, it means that you run a news organization.
[01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.011]  Assange scheduled a press event for October 1st.
[01:14:41.071 --> 01:14:44.192]  The world believed that he would drop his information that day.
[01:14:44.672 --> 01:14:45.153]  He didn't.
[01:14:45.513 --> 01:14:47.433]  You criticized him bitterly about it.
[01:14:47.794 --> 01:14:56.437]  He dropped the bomb four days later, as I predicted he was, because the source, which I identified for the House Intelligence Committee, told me that he would.
[01:14:56.497 --> 01:15:00.418]  And he delayed only because of threats against his life.
[01:15:00.938 --> 01:15:03.319]  I think he's a crusading journalist.
[01:15:03.359 --> 01:15:04.059]  No, I do too.
[01:15:04.079 --> 01:15:04.739]  But the truth is,
[01:15:07.779 --> 01:15:08.860]  He's dissed us!
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.582]  It's not like we're in bed with him.
[01:15:12.402 --> 01:15:14.183]  Listen, you're taking over the next three segments.
[01:15:14.303 --> 01:15:15.164]  Stay right there, Roger.
[01:15:15.224 --> 01:15:19.367]  Roger Stone will host the next three segments, because that's the only way I'm not going to jump in, because I've got so many points.
[01:15:19.387 --> 01:15:20.548]  I'll just let him flow.
[01:15:20.568 --> 01:15:21.669]  It's going to be powerful.
[01:15:21.729 --> 01:15:27.332]  Everybody should link to it, retweet it, Facebook it, because you are in their face when you spread the links, the articles, the videos.
[01:15:27.693 --> 01:15:31.775]  And separately, great products, a bunch of big specials within the next two days.

[01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:43.021]  50% off.
[01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:43.882]  That is about to end.
[01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:45.722]  And free shipping on that.
[01:15:45.783 --> 01:15:49.404]  And we've got a bunch of other big specials that are about to end at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:08.912]  You're on the air.
[01:18:08.932 --> 01:18:09.773]  Thanks for holding.
[01:18:09.873 --> 01:18:10.953]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:18:11.173 --> 01:18:11.553]  Hey, brother.
[01:18:11.574 --> 01:18:11.774]  Sir.
[01:18:12.074 --> 01:18:12.454]  Good, man.
[01:18:12.474 --> 01:18:13.274]  Thank you for calling.
[01:18:13.354 --> 01:18:13.915]  Hey, hey.
[01:18:14.015 --> 01:18:18.417]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:18:18.637 --> 01:18:25.001]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:18:25.141 --> 01:18:26.842]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[01:18:26.922 --> 01:18:33.706]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:18:34.246 --> 01:18:35.347]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:18:35.407 --> 01:18:39.430]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:41.492]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:18:41.872 --> 01:18:42.612]  And exactly.
[01:18:42.632 --> 01:18:46.856]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:18:47.216 --> 01:18:47.496]  Boom!
[01:18:47.636 --> 01:18:50.458]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:51.059]  It's amazing.
[01:18:51.119 --> 01:18:55.482]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:19:00.726 --> 01:19:02.708]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:19:02.808 --> 01:19:03.088]  Go ahead.
[01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:05.583]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:19:05.604 --> 01:19:08.646]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:19:09.486 --> 01:19:10.587]  It just gets old, man.
[01:19:10.907 --> 01:19:12.628]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:19:13.329 --> 01:19:15.410]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:19.673]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:19:19.693 --> 01:19:22.155]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:19:22.835 --> 01:19:25.317]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:19:25.657 --> 01:19:26.778]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:19:27.018 --> 01:19:27.899]  Us being shut down?
[01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:29.160]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.620]  You know what, Alex?
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.761]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:19:31.781 --> 01:19:32.601]  Hey, Frank!
[01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:38.223]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:19:38.543 --> 01:19:42.824]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.925]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:19:46.185 --> 01:19:46.565]  You understand?
[01:19:46.645 --> 01:19:47.926]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:19:48.286 --> 01:19:49.466]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:19:50.426 --> 01:19:55.348]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:19:56.308 --> 01:19:56.988]  Do you understand?
[01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.189]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.743]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.407 --> 01:20:23.053]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.374 --> 01:20:26.176]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:29.521]  Welcome back.
[01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:32.426]  You're on the Roger Stone Show.
[01:20:32.646 --> 01:20:34.689]  I'm picking up for Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:44.184]  We're going to talk about a lot of things in the time we have left, but the most important thing is to understand what's about to happen because the tide is turning.
[01:20:44.861 --> 01:21:00.442]  Because Rudy Giuliani, who is, I know, very controversial and is criticized by many, may just be the fighter, may just be the brawler, may just be the tough guy Donald Trump needs right now.
[01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:11.554]  And as you may have seen, he told Judge Jeanine that he was prepared to take them apart if they think they're going to take this president down.
[01:21:12.074 --> 01:21:14.777]  I think Donald Trump's patience grows thin.
[01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:19.563]  And now that he has learned that the FBI infiltrated his campaign,
[01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:40.082]  And now that he is furious over their false explanation that they infiltrated his campaign to look into Russian collusion, when in fact they infiltrated his campaign with the spy, Steph Halper, in order to plant evidence, false evidence, faux evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:21:40.522 --> 01:21:43.305]  Their entire narrative is crumbling.
[01:21:44.938 --> 01:21:47.540]  Look for these two cataclysmic events.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.843]  The publication of the Inspector General's report of the Justice Department.
[01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:54.904]  Heads will roll.
[01:21:55.404 --> 01:22:03.869]  A decision by Judge Ellis of Virginia, an honest and courageous judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the bench.
[01:22:04.249 --> 01:22:14.075]  Don't look for any decisions from the District of Columbia where you have a, at this level in the federal courts, a different judiciary.
[01:22:15.251 --> 01:22:17.893]  I do want to ask you all a personal favor.
[01:22:18.513 --> 01:22:27.399]  Do me a favor and go to theinfowars.com store now to get your copy of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:33.623]  This book can be for you what Saul Alinsky's manual is for the left.
[01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:44.245]  If you want to look for the tactics and the maxims and the guidelines that will lead you to victory, this is the book you need.
[01:22:44.766 --> 01:22:49.868]  If you want to learn how to make a mean martini, yes, this book includes
[01:22:50.925 --> 01:23:05.157]  Dick Nixon's secret recipe for his Silver Bullet, recently tried out by Michael Zimmerman, here of InfoWars, who attests to its quality as one of the greatest martinis he has ever had.
[01:23:05.537 --> 01:23:10.662]  So folks, please go to the InfoWars store now and get your copy of Stone's Rules.
[01:23:11.102 --> 01:23:12.403]  It's a win-win.
[01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:14.245]  It helps InfoWars.
[01:23:14.645 --> 01:23:16.467]  It helps the Stone family.
[01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:19.109]  And it helps the fight for freedom.
[01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:31.579]  Also joining us shortly, Senator Mike Williams, whose campaign for governor of Georgia is literally surging as he highlights the illegal immigration issue.
[01:23:32.039 --> 01:23:41.847]  Mike Williams has had the courage to take on the sanctuary cities in that state, including Atlanta and others, and he is actually now
[01:23:42.327 --> 01:23:52.229]  Being protested, picketed, boycotted by the left because of his fearless, conservative, pro-Trump stance.
[01:23:52.609 --> 01:23:54.690]  He will be joining us shortly.
[01:23:55.170 --> 01:24:05.112]  Also joining us, another patriot, Troy King, a former Attorney General of Alabama, running to get that seat back, running against
[01:24:05.632 --> 01:24:10.214]  Liberal, Democrat, posing as a Republican, Steve Marshall.
[01:24:10.594 --> 01:24:15.577]  Steve Marshall, appointed Attorney General by corrupt Governor Don Singelman.
[01:24:16.577 --> 01:24:21.179]  An Obama donor, posing as a conservative Republican.
[01:24:21.619 --> 01:24:23.800]  Overnight, he supports the President.
[01:24:24.181 --> 01:24:31.204]  Two dynamite, conservative, hard-charging challengers coming up right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:31.644 --> 01:24:33.605]  Senator Mike Williams and
[01:24:34.425 --> 01:24:39.309]  Former Attorney General and the next Attorney General of Alabama, Troy King.
[01:24:39.729 --> 01:24:43.632]  Stick with us for these dynamic interviews.
[01:24:44.553 --> 01:24:56.122]  Yes, we here at InfoWars were among the very first to identify the spy who was inserted into the Trump campaign by the FBI.
[01:24:56.832 --> 01:24:59.034]  This man is Stephen Halper.
[01:24:59.434 --> 01:25:04.317]  I've actually known Halper peripherally going back to the 1980s.
[01:25:04.777 --> 01:25:17.866]  Steph Halper was the man at the heart of the scandal in which George Bush operatives stole the debate preparation book of President Jimmy Carter.
[01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:25.812]  There was a congressional investigation, the Al-Basta investigation, into this chronic theft.
[01:25:26.392 --> 01:25:36.737]  I first identified Steph Alper as the operative involved in that in my book, The Bush Crime Family, available again at the Infowars.com store.
[01:25:37.337 --> 01:25:49.382]  But if you examine the reasons that Nixon was removed as president, it was because he was accused of surveilling the campaign of his Democratic opponent, Senator George McGovern.
[01:25:50.106 --> 01:25:56.591]  Even though six private citizens broke into the Watergate and planted bugs, which actually never worked.
[01:25:57.651 --> 01:26:06.317]  And of course, because his campaign was accused of infiltrating the campaign of Senator George McGovern with spies.
[01:26:06.978 --> 01:26:11.000]  What we've seen here is far, far more egregious.
[01:26:11.501 --> 01:26:12.361]  Here is why.
[01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:17.505]  That was one campaign wiretapping and spying on another.
[01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:26.417]  There's still no evidence that President Nixon knew about or approved either one of those operations, but they ultimately brought him down.
[01:26:26.938 --> 01:26:29.900]  Here we have something far more egregious.
[01:26:30.641 --> 01:26:40.611]  It's the use of the authority and the capability of the state intelligence apparatus for the purposes of spying on the Trump campaign.
[01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:46.399]  You notice the way the mainstream media has tried to move a narrative about Donald Trump Jr.
[01:26:46.839 --> 01:26:54.181]  meeting with a Saudi prince who offered, but was never taken up on, efforts to help in the election of Donald Trump.
[01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:57.242]  Why would they float this nothing burger story?
[01:26:57.802 --> 01:27:01.543]  Well, they've got to get Steph Halpern, the FBI, off of page one.
[01:27:02.043 --> 01:27:04.264]  That's why Donald Trump Jr.
[01:27:04.484 --> 01:27:05.424]  is a patriot.
[01:27:05.784 --> 01:27:06.804]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:27:06.864 --> 01:27:12.986]  was set up by a Russian lawyer, and we still can't get an answer to this simple question.
[01:27:13.466 --> 01:27:14.886]  How did she get in the country?
[01:27:15.527 --> 01:27:18.467]  Who gave her the visa to get into the country?
[01:27:18.787 --> 01:27:24.809]  She was denied a visa in her attempts to get here in connection to a legal case in which she had a client.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.530]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:27.731]  was set up.
[01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:31.751]  This was part and parcel of the same operation we've described.
[01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:34.652]  The operation to foster the phony dossier.
[01:27:34.972 --> 01:27:39.553]  The operation now to plant spies inside the Trump campaign.
[01:27:39.913 --> 01:27:47.275]  Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot, being unfairly attacked over a meeting today that yielded nothing.
[01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:51.133]  I'm Roger Stone, pinch-hitting for Alex Jones.
[01:27:51.374 --> 01:27:58.781]  It's a rainy Sunday night, but the Deep State is increasingly agitated and increasingly pressured.
[01:27:59.302 --> 01:28:04.447]  Their entire Russian collusion narrative is collapsing around their ears.
[01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:09.893]  That's why I said I wouldn't be shocked if they cooked up some offense against me.
[01:28:10.254 --> 01:28:17.022]  It doesn't relate in any way to WikiLeaks or the Russians, and probably not even to the 2016 election.
[01:28:17.463 --> 01:28:20.626]  It's an attempt to gag me, folks, to silence me.
[01:28:20.947 --> 01:28:21.588]  If you want to help,
[01:28:22.188 --> 01:28:24.851]  Go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:28:24.991 --> 01:28:27.433]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:28:27.774 --> 01:28:29.315]  They're trying to bankrupt me, folks.
[01:28:29.615 --> 01:28:31.577]  They're trying to destroy my family.
[01:28:31.918 --> 01:28:37.283]  They are making me dissipate the small fund I put aside for my grandchildren's
[01:28:37.483 --> 01:28:38.763]  How come Hollywood embraces
[01:29:06.838 --> 01:29:10.219]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.180]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.301]  It was statutory rape.
[01:29:13.401 --> 01:29:14.181]  Yeah, alright.
[01:29:14.241 --> 01:29:16.782]  Well, it's not statutory rape.
[01:29:16.802 --> 01:29:18.663]  He had sex with a minor.
[01:29:19.183 --> 01:29:20.824]  That's not rape.
[01:29:20.864 --> 01:29:22.965]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[01:29:23.305 --> 01:29:24.486]  That she didn't want to have.
[01:29:24.606 --> 01:29:26.067]  No, that was not the case at all.
[01:29:26.147 --> 01:29:27.207]  She wanted to have it.
[01:29:27.287 --> 01:29:29.428]  Well, with the transcripts.
[01:29:29.569 --> 01:29:30.469]  Dated the guy.
[01:29:30.809 --> 01:29:31.710]  Dated the guy.
[01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:33.471]  She was 13!
[01:29:33.531 --> 01:29:34.231]  And found out.
[01:29:34.671 --> 01:29:36.873]  By the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:39.194]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything.
[01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:40.915]  Wait a second.
[01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:42.516]  Morals in Europe more than China?
[01:29:42.616 --> 01:29:47.239]  With a 13 year old girl and you're a grown man, you know that that's wrong.
[01:29:47.279 --> 01:29:50.220]  You're giving her booze and pills.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:50.660]  I'm not.
[01:29:51.241 --> 01:29:51.441]  Look.
[01:29:52.185 --> 01:29:53.325]  She was down with it.
[01:29:53.345 --> 01:29:55.426]  Oh, you're crazy.
[01:29:55.546 --> 01:29:56.726]  And she's talked about it.
[01:29:56.746 --> 01:29:57.706]  She's talked about it.
[01:29:58.066 --> 01:30:00.647]  Why would he defend Roman Polanski in pedophilia?
[01:30:01.227 --> 01:30:03.648]  And then why, I mean, why is he so arrogant?
[01:30:03.688 --> 01:30:05.628]  And why is he being protected by Hollywood?
[01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:09.069]  You know, that would be a good question.
[01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:13.130]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:18.139]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[01:30:18.519 --> 01:30:28.549]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:35.056]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[01:30:39.016 --> 01:30:47.762]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[01:30:48.142 --> 01:31:04.435]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[01:31:05.075 --> 01:31:14.601]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[01:31:15.622 --> 01:31:17.523]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[01:31:17.563 --> 01:31:22.085]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:23.506]  That's what I do for a living.
[01:31:23.546 --> 01:31:28.990]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:32.512]  It's just what you do for a living.
[01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.181]  You have a job.
[01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:38.442]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[01:31:38.762 --> 01:31:46.864]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[01:31:46.884 --> 01:31:51.405]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[01:31:52.525 --> 01:31:53.885]  They have a real problem.
[01:31:53.945 --> 01:31:55.586]  They need to come back down to earth.
[01:31:55.666 --> 01:31:57.086]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.562]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[01:32:04.902 --> 01:32:12.367]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:19.151]  With InfoWars Life Select Storable Food, you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.

[01:33:03.893 --> 01:33:10.154]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.256 --> 01:33:16.816]  I follow Mark.
[01:33:17.822 --> 01:33:19.584]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[01:33:19.624 --> 01:33:24.009]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[01:33:25.631 --> 01:33:31.238]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[01:33:32.967 --> 01:33:56.029]  After a 40-year career in American politics and being in the forefront of those urging Donald Trump to run for president, confident that he had the courage and the agenda to bring real reform to America, literally hundreds of Republican candidates, many of them good men and women, seek my active support and endorsement.
[01:33:56.767 --> 01:34:03.176]  In many cases, I wish I could endorse and campaign for all of them, but it's just not physically possible.
[01:34:03.436 --> 01:34:05.679]  There are only so many hours in a day.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.307]  So I have to choose very carefully the men and women that I put my weight behind.
[01:34:11.987 --> 01:34:16.130]  Senator Michael Williams of Georgia is one such candidate.
[01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:29.077]  Michael Williams was for Donald Trump when the Republican establishment in his home state of Georgia was mostly supporting Jeb Bush, Mr. Low Energy.
[01:34:29.557 --> 01:34:42.966]  Now he's locked in a primary with country club Cagle, the liberal Republican who serves as lieutenant governor, who's attempting to reinvent himself as a solid, true-believing conservative.
[01:34:43.526 --> 01:34:52.012]  In recent days, though, Mike Williams has roiled that race by launching his immigration deportation tour.
[01:34:52.672 --> 01:35:01.320]  Using a bus, he's traveled across the state to illustrate the outrageousness of sanctuary series in the Peach State.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:08.546]  Joining us now, the dynamic next governor of Georgia, Senator Mike Williams.
[01:35:08.586 --> 01:35:11.208]  Senator Williams, welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:35:12.105 --> 01:35:13.026]  Well, thank you, Roger.
[01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:16.587]  It is a pleasure to be here, and absolutely thank you for your endorsement.
[01:35:16.607 --> 01:35:17.688]  It was an honor to have it.
[01:35:18.328 --> 01:35:24.372]  We couldn't have done it without your support, and we are out here on the bus tour right now.
[01:35:24.392 --> 01:35:28.034]  We're on day five of the Michael Williams Deportation Bus Tour.
[01:35:28.074 --> 01:35:30.175]  We've traveled all over North.
[01:35:30.835 --> 01:35:32.456]  Uh, central Atlanta area.
[01:35:32.496 --> 01:35:39.581]  We went to several of the sanctuary cities in Georgia and we've been met by protesters and as well as supporters.
[01:35:39.661 --> 01:35:45.085]  So people are very excited about this bus and we're going to finish this thing strong.
[01:35:46.351 --> 01:35:51.316]  Well, I must say, you have captured the imagination of both the state and the national media.
[01:35:51.456 --> 01:35:53.377]  I saw you on Fox News.
[01:35:53.497 --> 01:36:02.726]  The report we put up here at InfoWars got a record number of hits because you have the courage to stand up on an issue that others shy away from.
[01:36:03.386 --> 01:36:08.028]  This is, I think, the key to your coming victory.
[01:36:08.408 --> 01:36:13.769]  And I've never seen a campaign peak like this at exactly the right time.
[01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:17.030]  You have a very skilled campaign manager.
[01:36:17.050 --> 01:36:21.552]  He has done a superb job of helping you frame this issue.
[01:36:22.032 --> 01:36:24.252]  You're a man of enormous courage.
[01:36:24.813 --> 01:36:27.493]  So tell us where the bus tour is going.
[01:36:27.673 --> 01:36:36.455]  I understand Cracker Barrel won't let you bring your bus into their parking lot because it's for a political campaign.
[01:36:36.495 --> 01:36:39.735]  So folks, don't spend your dollars at the Cracker Barrel.
[01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:43.316]  Send your dollars right now to Senator Mike Williams.
[01:36:43.716 --> 01:36:47.317]  He needs your support to get over the finish line.
[01:36:47.717 --> 01:36:49.777]  Where does the bus tour go from here, Mike?
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.824]  Well, we are on the way to Savannah, Georgia.
[01:36:53.904 --> 01:36:57.648]  We are going to be in Forsyth Park at about 7.30 in Savannah, Georgia.
[01:36:57.788 --> 01:37:03.134]  And we understand that there's going to be a large crowd of supporters as well as protesters.
[01:37:03.174 --> 01:37:05.797]  So we are looking forward to addressing all of them.
[01:37:06.098 --> 01:37:07.599]  And you're absolutely right, Roger.
[01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:11.204]  We had several of our stops planned for
[01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:13.066]  Cracker Barrel.
[01:37:13.626 --> 01:37:17.127]  And at every single one of our stops, they had several corporate people out there.
[01:37:17.167 --> 01:37:18.387]  They had police lined up.
[01:37:18.767 --> 01:37:20.908]  They were trying to stop us from coming in.
[01:37:21.448 --> 01:37:23.268]  And today, we actually said, you know what?
[01:37:23.648 --> 01:37:24.989]  This is a free country.
[01:37:25.409 --> 01:37:32.610]  And we have the illegal immigration deportation bus that represents law and order and what makes this country great.
[01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:35.811]  And we are not going to allow them to just say no to us and stop us.
[01:37:35.831 --> 01:37:39.552]  So we parked our RV, we parked our bus outside, and we walked on in.
[01:37:40.032 --> 01:37:40.613]  We're good to go.
[01:37:54.494 --> 01:38:07.617]  Well, so if you're a Savannah area Info Warriors, tell us again where you're going to be, Senator Williams, because I'm urging all of our listeners and viewers to go on down and voice their support.
[01:38:08.037 --> 01:38:08.557]  Be there.
[01:38:08.737 --> 01:38:12.198]  Never mind the Antifas and the left-wing protesters.
[01:38:12.258 --> 01:38:18.099]  Come out and meet Senator Williams and get involved in the fight for a better Georgia.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.320]  Tell us again where that is, Senator.
[01:38:21.167 --> 01:38:24.330]  Yeah, we are going to be at Four Sides Park in Savannah.
[01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:26.351]  Again, it's Four Sides Park in Savannah.
[01:38:26.391 --> 01:38:41.403]  And if you want someone that's going to be a fearless conservative like myself, that's going to stand up to the liberals, to the progressives, that are going to talk about the issues that are important to this country, the people of Georgia, not just bow down and cave to the establishment, to the lobbyists.
[01:38:41.423 --> 01:38:50.269]  You know, if you're tired of Country Club Casey Cagle, if you're tired of Country Club Cagle, you need to come out, you need to support us, and vote for me on Tuesday, May 22nd.
[01:38:51.869 --> 01:38:53.210]  All right, there you have it.
[01:38:53.671 --> 01:38:58.295]  One of the most dynamic Republican candidates I have ever met, Senator Mike Williams.
[01:38:58.675 --> 01:39:01.017]  His campaign in Georgia surging.
[01:39:01.437 --> 01:39:03.339]  Now is the time to make a difference.
[01:39:03.439 --> 01:39:11.846]  Go to his website, make a contribution, go and meet his deportation bus tour tonight in Savannah, Georgia.
[01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:16.930]  Thank you so much, Senator Williams, for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:17.691 --> 01:39:18.152]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:39:18.172 --> 01:39:18.592]  My pleasure.
[01:39:19.528 --> 01:39:22.609]  God bless you and victory or death.
[01:39:23.389 --> 01:39:28.170]  Folks, while you're at it, please take a moment to go to the InfoWars.com store.

[01:40:06.654 --> 01:40:12.218]  These are the very best nutraceutical all-natural products you will find.
[01:40:12.678 --> 01:40:21.725]  What Alex Jones has a tendency to do is work with scientists who fuse the very best of century-old Chinese herbology
[01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:30.111]  With cutting-edge, modern, newly discovered nutraceuticals to bring you some of the best products you can find.
[01:40:30.572 --> 01:40:37.817]  Now, I like Brain Force Plus because when you work here at InfoWars, sometimes you're putting in long, long hours.
[01:40:38.277 --> 01:40:40.619]  We have to jump when the news breaks.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:45.283]  We head for Skype, we head for a camera, we head for a microphone.
[01:40:45.923 --> 01:40:53.288]  And I get that dip in the late afternoon around four, I get sleepy, I get tired, I get unfocused.
[01:40:53.849 --> 01:41:05.816]  You pop two of these babies, Brain Force Plus, and within 20 minutes, you have new mental vitality, new mental energy, new mental clarity.
[01:41:06.197 --> 01:41:11.040]  But the best thing about Brain Force Plus is you're not jacked up.
[01:41:11.863 --> 01:41:17.826]  Three, four, five hours later, when it's finally time to hit the hay, there is no insomnia.
[01:41:18.106 --> 01:41:29.412]  You don't have that wide-eyed energy drink feeling that you're so wired you can't get the rest your body needs.
[01:41:29.912 --> 01:41:36.595]  Again, folks, my personal favorite, Brain Force Plus at a terrific price, now $29.95.
[01:41:36.675 --> 01:41:37.356]  That's a savings of $10.
[01:41:40.407 --> 01:41:46.132]  And you can see 5,936 satisfied reviews.
[01:41:46.653 --> 01:41:48.634]  This is the best of the best.

[01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:27.873]  If federal agents show up and grab Alex Jones to silence him in this bogus Russian investigation, he's going to need lawyers just like I do.
[01:42:28.253 --> 01:42:33.860]  Help us now by going to the InfoWars site and getting the product of your choice.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.045]  And while you're there, order your copy of Stone's Rules.

[01:42:56.232 --> 01:42:56.973]  God bless you.
[01:42:57.153 --> 01:42:58.533]  We're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:58.753 --> 01:43:00.154]  We'll be right back with Troy.
[01:43:00.574 --> 01:43:02.755]  It's just gonna get more Twilight Zone from here.
[01:43:09.013 --> 01:43:13.148]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:43:18.405 --> 01:43:27.935]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[01:43:28.055 --> 01:43:28.876]  It got ugly.
[01:43:28.916 --> 01:43:30.938]  Violence erupting at the event.
[01:43:31.098 --> 01:43:37.945]  It's spikes, broke out, fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[01:43:38.325 --> 01:43:42.349]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[01:43:49.466 --> 01:43:51.910]  You say he's not your president, then you shouldn't be here!
[01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.653]  Those motherfuckers bring us together!
[01:43:54.673 --> 01:43:55.615]  You got that?
[01:43:55.695 --> 01:43:57.277]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:44:04.574 --> 01:44:10.041]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:44:10.302 --> 01:44:17.911]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:44:18.172 --> 01:44:21.336]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:44:21.596 --> 01:44:22.076]  We're good to go.
[01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:50.315]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pal Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[01:44:50.575 --> 01:44:55.277]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:55.377 --> 01:44:57.058]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:00.521 --> 01:45:03.723]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:04.163 --> 01:45:05.484]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:05.964 --> 01:45:17.491]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:18.192 --> 01:45:23.295]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:45:23.695 --> 01:45:27.079]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:27.519 --> 01:45:33.366]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:33.566 --> 01:45:38.211]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:41.034]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:41.374 --> 01:45:42.735]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:43.115 --> 01:45:52.742]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:52.842 --> 01:45:54.964]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[01:45:55.504 --> 01:46:00.409]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:04.193]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:46:04.593 --> 01:46:07.015]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:46:07.316 --> 01:46:11.660]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.980]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:46:14.521 --> 01:46:17.501]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.
[01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:22.082]  bottles, Immune Gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen, or wherever you go.
[01:46:22.643 --> 01:46:28.864]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentist recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[01:46:29.344 --> 01:46:36.926]  As a powerful hand purifier or oral cleansing formula, just a small spray will help you stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[01:46:37.466 --> 01:46:44.268]  With powerful, yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.

[01:47:04.989 --> 01:47:21.302]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.862 --> 01:47:22.403]  News.
[01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:23.744]  Analysis.
[01:47:24.284 --> 01:47:24.925]  Reports.
[01:47:25.665 --> 01:47:27.867]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:28.367 --> 01:47:31.230]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:34.290]  Welcome back.
[01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:36.451]  We're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:37.152 --> 01:47:41.654]  I think most of you know that I'm a 40 year student of American politics.
[01:47:42.334 --> 01:47:51.119]  And one of the things I do is to study very carefully the scientific polling of all voters, but particularly Republican voters.
[01:47:51.599 --> 01:47:55.861]  And I can tell you that I have detected a phenomena across the country.
[01:47:56.576 --> 01:48:06.422]  Donald Trump is far more popular than the Republican Party, than Republican members of Congress, and Republican establishment figures.
[01:48:06.962 --> 01:48:23.733]  And that's why there's a phenomena going on in the country where rhinos and country club Republicans, who never supported Donald Trump, now try to reinvent themselves and fool the voters into believing that they are Trump Republicans.
[01:48:24.253 --> 01:48:33.163]  Well, joining us today is a crusading 100% genuine conservative Trump Republican, Troy King.
[01:48:33.724 --> 01:48:44.376]  Troy King is a former Attorney General of the state of Alabama who had an extraordinary record as a crime buster in that job.
[01:48:44.936 --> 01:49:11.497]  And he's facing a faux-Republican, Steve Marshall, who suddenly overnight, despite the fact that he was a Democrat, appointed State's District Attorney by Democrat Don Siegelman, ran with Barack Obama, was on the Democratic ticket in 2004 and 2010, and then in 2011, Marshall miraculously switched parties.
[01:49:14.259 --> 01:49:18.962]  And now he wants you to believe that he's a Donald Trump Republican.
[01:49:19.322 --> 01:49:26.547]  Well, there's only one Trump Republican in this important Alabama race, and that is Troy King.
[01:49:27.307 --> 01:49:31.530]  I've done a case study on this race.
[01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:42.217]  As I said earlier, I wish I could endorse all of the good men and women with real conservative credentials who reach out to me for my support.
[01:49:42.697 --> 01:49:45.419]  But there are only so many hours in the day.
[01:49:45.799 --> 01:49:49.641]  There are only so many things that I, one person, can do.
[01:49:50.222 --> 01:49:52.423]  But here's one thing I am proud to do.
[01:49:52.823 --> 01:49:54.724]  I'm supporting Troy King.
[01:49:55.185 --> 01:49:57.566]  I'm going to campaign for Troy King.
[01:49:57.986 --> 01:50:03.089]  And joining us now, the next Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Troy King.
[01:50:03.450 --> 01:50:05.511]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:06.211 --> 01:50:07.392]  Wow, that was quite a build-up.
[01:50:07.612 --> 01:50:08.172]  Thanks, Roger.
[01:50:08.212 --> 01:50:08.913]  Nice to be with you.
[01:50:10.177 --> 01:50:15.741]  So, tell us, Troy, we know the difference between you and Steve Marshall.
[01:50:16.261 --> 01:50:23.886]  We know a little bit about the race, but I'm going to be covering this race intensely in the three weeks ahead.
[01:50:24.366 --> 01:50:27.868]  What would you say is the number one issue in the race?
[01:50:28.949 --> 01:50:35.073]  Well, the number one issue in this race is the top three issues, really, Roger, are corruption, corruption, corruption.
[01:50:35.773 --> 01:50:38.415]  Alabama is in the throes of the most corrupt
[01:50:39.153 --> 01:50:42.856]  Uh, government that we've had in the history of Alabama, and that's saying quite a lot.
[01:50:43.516 --> 01:50:52.003]  In fact, the reason I got into this race is because I have watched as members of the legislature, the Speaker of the House, have all been forced out of office.
[01:50:52.143 --> 01:50:55.946]  The Governor of the state have all been forced out of office because of corruption.
[01:50:56.566 --> 01:51:03.431]  And I'm afraid we've got an entire generation of kids that are growing up believing that there's something wrong with being in public service.
[01:51:03.751 --> 01:51:06.293]  That oaths don't mean anything.
[01:51:06.333 --> 01:51:08.315]  The Constitution doesn't mean anything.
[01:51:08.955 --> 01:51:13.399]  People think they can just get on TV and say, oh, well, I'm a Trump Republican.
[01:51:13.439 --> 01:51:14.519]  I'm a real Republican.
[01:51:14.559 --> 01:51:15.500]  I'm a conservative.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.561]  I'm for the wall.
[01:51:17.141 --> 01:51:20.284]  And it doesn't matter what they really believe, what they've really done.
[01:51:20.304 --> 01:51:25.688]  And it's time that we shine a light and we expose these people and we take our state back from them.
[01:51:27.119 --> 01:51:46.338]  Well, as I recall in February 2017, Steve Marshall was appointed Attorney General by a governor who was then under impeachment proceedings by the Alabama legislature and was the subject of an investigation by the Alabama Attorney General's Office on the referral of four felony ethics charges.
[01:51:46.998 --> 01:52:08.785]  Then, Attorney General Steve Marshall promptly recused himself from direct involvement in the investigation into that next governor who was prosecuted and forced from office, Governor Bentley, who ended up pleading guilty, as I recall, to two misdemeanors exactly two months after Marshall was appointed.
[01:52:09.245 --> 01:52:10.685]  This guy is a sheep.
[01:52:11.686 --> 01:52:12.026]  Pardon me.
[01:52:12.706 --> 01:52:15.047]  He is a wolf in sheep's clothing, folks.
[01:52:15.527 --> 01:52:17.668]  He is an Obama Democrat.
[01:52:18.028 --> 01:52:25.030]  He is a Don Siegelman Democrat, now suddenly posing as a Trump Republican.
[01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.930]  Here's what I know.
[01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:32.812]  When Troy King was Attorney General, crime in Alabama was at a 20-year low.
[01:52:33.212 --> 01:52:35.973]  Violent crime hit a 20-year low.
[01:52:36.393 --> 01:52:40.074]  Now, under Steve Marshall, violent crime is at a 30-year high.
[01:52:41.976 --> 01:52:47.794]  This is a classic case of a real, genuine, rock-ribbed, conservative Republican.
[01:52:48.544 --> 01:52:56.145]  Opposing an Obama donor whose filing fees went to underwrite the campaign for Barack Obama.
[01:52:57.286 --> 01:53:00.846]  The issues here could not be clearer.
[01:53:01.386 --> 01:53:03.787]  So how do you feel about the campaign, Troy?
[01:53:04.107 --> 01:53:05.147]  Three weeks to go.
[01:53:05.607 --> 01:53:08.128]  I know your campaign is also surging.
[01:53:08.668 --> 01:53:10.008]  I've looked at the polling.
[01:53:10.328 --> 01:53:13.368]  It appears to me that you are on the victory trail.
[01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:15.849]  But how do you feel there out on the hustings?
[01:53:16.645 --> 01:53:20.110]  Oh, well, I believe our message resonates with Alabama voters, Roger.
[01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:27.459]  Alabama, look, the county in America that voted by the greatest percentage for Donald Trump is Winston County, Alabama.
[01:53:28.166 --> 01:53:29.807]  This is Trump country.
[01:53:30.307 --> 01:53:34.730]  This is the buckle of the belt of conservatism around America.
[01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:37.311]  And the heartland of America gets it.
[01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:42.314]  The heartland of America is sick and tired of people who pose as something that they're not.
[01:53:43.354 --> 01:53:44.335]  Check this out, Roger.
[01:53:44.495 --> 01:53:50.158]  If Steve Marshall were to become the Republican nominee, guess who the Democrat nominee is likely to be?
[01:53:52.039 --> 01:53:53.179]  Don Siegelman's son.
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:55.801]  How would that be for a showdown?
[01:53:56.744 --> 01:54:02.727]  Yeah, it looks to me like a heads-you-win, tails-heads-I-win, tails-you-lose election.
[01:54:02.767 --> 01:54:05.649]  Now, there's two other candidates in this race.
[01:54:05.869 --> 01:54:10.992]  Alice Martin, who was a Reagan-Bush nominee, she's running a poor third.
[01:54:11.572 --> 01:54:17.075]  Unfortunately, she sought the appointment from Governor Bentley, but she lied about it publicly.
[01:54:17.615 --> 01:54:26.301]  At a time that ethics are the number one issue in Alabama, I don't think we can afford to have a proven liar in the Attorney General's office.
[01:54:26.762 --> 01:54:32.806]  And then there's Chess Bedsoul, who was the paid state director for Donald Trump.
[01:54:33.286 --> 01:54:35.447]  He's running in fourth place.
[01:54:35.787 --> 01:54:37.247]  Folks, don't be fooled.
[01:54:37.427 --> 01:54:39.368]  He's not a Trump Republican.
[01:54:39.748 --> 01:55:02.015]  He's a paid political operative who epitomizes the political establishment with a capital E. If you want a serious conservative, not some wealthy country club Republican trying to get you to buy into the phony idea that he's a Trump-type reformer, there is only one choice in this race.
[01:55:02.535 --> 01:55:04.337]  And that's our friend, Troy King.
[01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:11.683]  Troy, I'm going to have you back on InfoWars because I think this is among the most important races in the country.
[01:55:12.043 --> 01:55:17.588]  You are endorsed by my good friend, Dr. Randy Brinson, who I supported for the U.S.
[01:55:17.608 --> 01:55:19.229]  Senate way back when.
[01:55:19.249 --> 01:55:23.072]  I'm proud that you could join us at last minute here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:23.472 --> 01:55:24.253]  God bless you.
[01:55:24.573 --> 01:55:26.114]  Godspeed and good luck.
[01:55:26.435 --> 01:55:30.178]  We're going to be covering this race as it goes down the road.
[01:55:30.598 --> 01:55:34.548]  To what I think will be an extraordinary victory for Troy King.
[01:55:34.648 --> 01:55:35.992]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:55:36.553 --> 01:55:37.115]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:55:38.587 --> 01:55:53.999]  Well, there you have it, folks, a solid conservative, Troy King, being opposed by a faux Republican, a Barack Obama Democrat, Steve Marshall, now suddenly posing as a Trump Republican.
[01:55:54.119 --> 01:55:54.499]  Why?
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:56.501]  Because it's popular.
[01:55:56.801 --> 01:56:03.586]  This is a phenomena I'm seeing all over the country, where rhinos try to fool Republican voters.
[01:56:04.006 --> 01:56:06.969]  You see it in Georgia, in the Michael Williams
[01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:16.035]  Casey Cagle, who we call Country Club Casey Cagle race, where suddenly Cagle's a born-again conservative.
[01:56:16.376 --> 01:56:19.658]  We see it here in Alabama with Troy King.
[01:56:20.313 --> 01:56:25.557]  Folks, thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars.
[01:56:26.018 --> 01:56:31.882]  Again, please go to the InfoWars.com site and grab your copy of Stone's Rules.
[01:56:32.243 --> 01:56:37.987]  This is for InfoWarriors what Saul Alinsky's book is for the left.
[01:56:38.327 --> 01:56:41.430]  This is my operating manual for victory.
[01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.912]  Whether you're in politics, business,
[01:56:44.645 --> 01:56:50.048]  Fashion, media, style, or even agriculture.
[01:56:50.108 --> 01:56:54.370]  No matter what your advocation, these rules work, folks.
[01:56:54.590 --> 01:57:01.314]  It is the guidelines and maxims that have guided my 40-year career in American politics.
[01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:04.796]  When you buy this book at InfoWars rather than
[01:57:05.756 --> 01:57:08.557]  Oh, I don't know, Amazon or Barnes and Noble.
[01:57:09.057 --> 01:57:09.997]  It's a twofer.
[01:57:10.317 --> 01:57:12.197]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[01:57:12.517 --> 01:57:19.999]  You're helping us fund our opposition to the phony, frivolous lawsuits that they've cooked up against Donald Trump.
[01:57:20.419 --> 01:57:23.580]  Pardon me, against Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.680]  This is the greatest single struggle we have.
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:29.561]  The struggle over Internet censorship.
[01:57:30.061 --> 01:57:44.471]  There's an effort to silence us, whether it is Robert Mueller hooking up phony offenses that he claims that I have committed in an effort to gag me, or whether it is their new intense looking at Alex Jones.
[01:57:44.911 --> 01:57:45.712]  We need your help.
[01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:48.774]  Please join us at the Infopor site now.
[01:57:50.375 --> 01:57:52.977]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:52.997 --> 01:57:53.337]  Go ahead.
[01:57:54.248 --> 01:57:56.131]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:57:56.171 --> 01:58:05.581]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:58:06.683 --> 01:58:10.067]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[01:58:10.587 --> 01:58:12.909]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:15.470]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.770]  Thank you.
[01:58:16.451 --> 01:58:18.912]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:58:18.932 --> 01:58:22.715]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:58:23.255 --> 01:58:26.217]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:58:26.277 --> 01:58:27.258]  They are quality.
[01:58:27.598 --> 01:58:28.839]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:58:29.319 --> 01:58:32.041]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:32.741]  Absolutely.
[01:58:33.281 --> 01:58:46.210]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[01:58:51.074 --> 01:58:56.337]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
