[00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.692]  You, Alex, are fearless.
[00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:13.173]  You're not afraid of them.
[00:14:13.234 --> 00:14:14.855]  You won't be cowed by them.
[00:14:14.936 --> 00:14:16.838]  You won't be bullied by them.
[00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:19.641]  You won't be sued into silence by them.
[00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:21.463]  And they hate that more than anything else.
[00:14:21.884 --> 00:14:29.573]  When you stand up to them, when you show that you're a man and you're not a cuck, and you're ready to fight, and you'll go to the streets if that's what it takes,
[00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:39.894]  And you continue every single day to broadcast the truth and expose their unconstitutional plot, it drives them completely insane.
[00:14:40.394 --> 00:14:42.636]  They have to get InfoWars off the air.
[00:14:42.996 --> 00:14:45.218]  They have to get InfoWars off the internet.
[00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:50.363]  They have to get InfoWars off YouTube, because we're exposing them.
[00:14:51.264 --> 00:14:56.849]  And I want to be clear, we've got a break here in 30 seconds, and I'm not trying to scare people, because when they get us, they admit they're coming for everybody.
[00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:03.030]  They're demonizing me and lying about me and doing this in preparation for an assassination.
[00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.252]  Let's just be honest about that.
[00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:05.896]  That's the next move.
[00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:08.898]  And hey, as long as everybody understands that narrative, I'm not worried about that.
[00:15:09.219 --> 00:15:10.480]  I knew what I got into doing this.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.742]  Like John Paul Jones said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:18.547]  I just hope America understands we're dealing with the purest tyranny this planet has ever seen.
[00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:20.408]  It is scientific.
[00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:21.689]  It is insanely arrogant.
[00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:22.670]  It is crazy.
[00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.212]  And I mean, everything Mueller's doing is completely illegal.
[00:15:25.252 --> 00:15:26.153]  They've lied to everybody.
[00:15:26.173 --> 00:15:27.074]  They lied to Congress.
[00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:29.276]  Comey said that no one ever wiretapped.
[00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:37.241]  Uh, the president or anybody else when he was running or when he was elected or when he was president, all of it premeditated, criminalized by the Clinton Cabal.
[00:15:37.582 --> 00:15:40.144]  They'll be back with Roger Stone hosting via his cell phone.
[00:15:40.864 --> 00:15:43.786]  Some powers coming back on here with our backup generators.
[00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:47.069]  Uh, and again, we'll be right back on TV and radio.
[00:15:47.109 --> 00:15:51.572]  Sorry it's only audio for the cable and TV viewers, but probably makes it a little bit more fun, doesn't it?
[00:15:53.132 --> 00:15:55.575]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.
[00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:58.778]  This is a money-saving message from Tax Mediation Services.
[00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:03.043]  If your business owes $20,000 or more in taxes, we can help you.
[00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:34.556]  ...of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:16:34.816 --> 00:16:36.756]  And this part is most important.
[00:16:36.856 --> 00:16:43.299]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.759]  That means it's clean.
[00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:46.079]  That means it's pure.
[00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:49.020]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.781]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:16:51.941 --> 00:16:53.582]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:57.506]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:16:57.967 --> 00:16:59.287]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:11.296]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:17.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:27.146]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:33.250]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:41.816]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:46.520]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.782]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:17:49.342 --> 00:17:54.206]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:58.250]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.233]  But instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:07.057]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:09.859]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.819]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:27.451]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:43.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:18:44.198 --> 00:18:47.907]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:50.192]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:18:50.232 --> 00:18:52.477]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.143]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:18:59.203 --> 00:19:00.644]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:01.044]  Go ahead.
[00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:01.444]  Yes.
[00:19:01.884 --> 00:19:02.565]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:08.908]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:09.129 --> 00:19:13.111]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.792]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:22.076]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[00:19:22.376 --> 00:19:25.018]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:25.078 --> 00:19:28.480]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.361]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:37.746]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:38.246]  So, thank you.
[00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:44.090]  But when you mention the Silver Bullock Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.691]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:49.535]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:49.615 --> 00:19:52.638]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet.
[00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:59.185]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.906]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:19.347 --> 00:20:21.728]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.912 --> 00:20:42.720]  We are faced by an organized, public, criminal conspiracy, with rogue elements of the FBI appointed during four different administrations, a globalist Herbert Walker Bush,
[00:20:44.645 --> 00:21:02.576]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, W, Obama, and they are pissed that Trump and patriots in our intelligence agencies and the American voters and our friends in Britain took them down.
[00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:06.919]  Because the plan was to totally end the UK, the US, everything.
[00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:07.840]  Europe's already fallen.
[00:21:09.096 --> 00:21:12.918]  It's not that these elites that we've got in charge right now, or trying to be in charge, are perfect.
[00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:14.639]  They're just not out to get us.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.581]  And they're not anti-capitalist.
[00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:18.462]  God, we're in trouble, folks.
[00:21:18.482 --> 00:21:24.325]  There are hundreds of articles a day saying, ban Alex Jones off the air, period.
[00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:30.189]  And then they list a film Robert De Niro promoted, Vaxxed, that is a liberal movie.
[00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.832]  And just shows medical science and people getting hurt from vaccines that the inserts say.
[00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:36.373]  You can make a movie just reading the inserts.
[00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.250]  And it's everywhere.
[00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.371]  It's these professors.
[00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:42.191]  Let's pull up this Lemovitz guy.
[00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:43.872]  He says, look, it's censorship.
[00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:44.512]  We'll admit it.
[00:21:44.632 --> 00:21:45.432]  Take them off the air.
[00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:46.672]  And he says it's not enough.
[00:21:46.692 --> 00:21:48.673]  Then we have to train children Alex Jones is evil.
[00:21:49.953 --> 00:22:02.316]  And then I saw an Austin American Statesman article in a Star Tribune article, without even looking last night, with the same thing with writers going, I went to my granddaughter's school this week, or I went to my daughter's school this week.
[00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:03.037]  It was all daughters.
[00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:04.157]  That's the script they put out.
[00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:09.004]  And then they go and they go, oh, Alex Jones is attacking Hillary!
[00:22:09.064 --> 00:22:11.144]  And both articles were the same, the same day.
[00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:16.667]  And it was like the young girls saw him in eighth grade and they all got sick.
[00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:20.288]  And you're like, my God, is this Venezuela or something?
[00:22:20.888 --> 00:22:27.331]  There's state-run media everywhere where they are already in the schools saying, here's Alex Jones, he hates women, and the girls get sick.
[00:22:29.366 --> 00:22:31.749]  And they go, he hurt the Sandy Hook children!
[00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:33.050]  And they go, oh!
[00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.573]  And then it's just all this branding, this setup.
[00:22:36.854 --> 00:22:39.657]  I was told by high-level CIA that Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:22:40.748 --> 00:22:46.790]  And then I've always gone back and forth, but I'm not attacking the people, or the folks, and I can't sit there and look at those parents and have their kids die.
[00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.070]  So I've said, fine, I'm not going to argue that.
[00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.531]  I'm sorry, I apologize.
[00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:51.351]  But they don't care.
[00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:55.512]  The media always picks it up and rebrands it and says Jones is attacking children again.
[00:22:55.752 --> 00:22:58.513]  Jones goes to their houses and tells them it didn't happen.
[00:22:58.693 --> 00:23:00.913]  And for years I'm saying, no it happened, I apologize.
[00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.074]  I see the whole media set up in this.
[00:23:03.994 --> 00:23:06.216]  And they just go back to it, and it's tactics!
[00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:11.941]  And then they go teach school children about me, and tell them I'm doing it currently, and then exaggerate what I did.
[00:23:13.703 --> 00:23:14.684]  And then sue me for it!
[00:23:14.764 --> 00:23:16.245]  Do you see the methodology?
[00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:17.386]  Do you see the plan?
[00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:20.789]  Saying Trump's a loser, Trump's a criminal, Trump's incontinent.
[00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.012]  Trump's a liar, Cavuto turning on him.
[00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:27.515]  And saying, you know, you're the swamp, you stink.
[00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:30.718]  You said you signed more bills than any other president in their first year.
[00:23:32.472 --> 00:23:33.753]  You said you didn't know about your lawyer.
[00:23:33.773 --> 00:23:35.214]  Yes, he had the lawyer do it, exactly.
[00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:36.995]  Doesn't matter, it's his own personal life.
[00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:50.383]  He's delivered 95% of what he said he'd do, and he's gotten a bigger tax cut, and more done, if you look at what he's done, with executive orders and actions and bills, and now this peace deal with North Korea coming up.
[00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:56.407]  He is one of the most successful presidents in our lifetimes, in the last century.
[00:23:57.819 --> 00:24:00.443]  If he beats these globalists, he'll be up there with George Washington.
[00:24:00.804 --> 00:24:04.851]  But the war is now, and there is a coup against the president.
[00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:22.479]  There is a public coup by rogue groups set up by Rosenstein and the Clintons, and these whole cabal have been caught with their fake dossier, that they're still paying money, their own families that work there to make up this fiction, and they file lawsuits on Trump, on myself, on Roger.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.341]  We're the big trifecta targets, folks, because they know we're not scared and we're Americana.
[00:24:27.721 --> 00:24:29.181]  And so I'm proud to stand with Trump.
[00:24:29.461 --> 00:24:31.141]  Do I get mad at him sometimes when he goes sideways?
[00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:34.202]  Damn right, because you really get mad at those you care about, your family.
[00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:36.453]  This is it.
[00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:37.734]  This is the war for America.
[00:24:37.774 --> 00:24:38.755]  This is the whole future.
[00:24:38.775 --> 00:24:39.696]  This is the whole thing.
[00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:41.357]  The power's coming back up.
[00:24:41.777 --> 00:24:43.278]  Our generators have properly kicked in.
[00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:46.741]  We have a whole building system, basically, but it didn't kick over right.
[00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:48.422]  I'm having a more expensive big one put in.
[00:24:49.414 --> 00:24:50.254]  Let's go back to Roger.
[00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:52.035]  He'll be hosting all three hours today.
[00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:54.855]  I've got to go take care of emergency operations here in about 30 minutes.
[00:24:54.875 --> 00:24:55.915]  Zach's coming up next segment.
[00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:57.876]  Our great intel source has bombshell info.
[00:24:57.896 --> 00:25:00.076]  Pentagon confirms Chinese fired lasers at U.S.
[00:25:00.096 --> 00:25:00.416]  pilots.
[00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:02.497]  But right now, I'll go back to Roger.
[00:25:02.537 --> 00:25:07.458]  Roger, I cannot express the rogue criminal coup taking place.
[00:25:07.558 --> 00:25:08.758]  They've committed all these crimes.
[00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:10.819]  The illegal wiretapping of his lawyer.
[00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:13.659]  They said they didn't tap Trump Tower.
[00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:15.140]  Got caught lying about that.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.620]  This is insane, Roger.
[00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:18.897]  Extraordinary.
[00:25:19.037 --> 00:25:29.845]  So it's reported, I think correctly, that the FBI was wiretapping, was surveilling the phone conversations of Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen.
[00:25:30.586 --> 00:25:33.068]  Today they said, oh no, that's not true.
[00:25:33.755 --> 00:25:36.677]  We were only monitoring his conversations.
[00:25:37.218 --> 00:25:40.120]  As far as I know, monitoring means listening in on.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.082]  Let me explain.
[00:25:42.162 --> 00:25:45.604]  I explained this back in 2017 when the media was trying to confuse it.
[00:25:45.624 --> 00:25:46.385]  They go, Jones is lying.
[00:25:46.405 --> 00:25:47.286]  There was no wiretap.
[00:25:47.586 --> 00:25:48.827]  Well, they called it wiretaps.
[00:25:49.187 --> 00:25:52.249]  That's an old parlance in legalese and federal code.
[00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.871]  Monitoring is the whole NSA term.
[00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:56.112]  Exactly.
[00:25:56.193 --> 00:26:01.417]  So it's digital through their hub because they didn't add a little tap with a recorder on it at the phone company.
[00:26:01.437 --> 00:26:01.717]  Go ahead.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.040]  No, it's outdated technology.
[00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:07.422]  The point is, of course, Cohn was under surveillance.
[00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:11.403]  The President's personal attorney was under surveillance.
[00:26:12.803 --> 00:26:27.468]  If Cohn paid Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who's changed her positions in this whole thing more times than she changes them in her videos, that would not be an illegal act.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.122]  Even if the president reimbursed Combs, that is not an illegal act.
[00:26:32.162 --> 00:26:33.443]  He didn't use campaign funds.
[00:26:33.863 --> 00:26:35.684]  There's no illegality here.
[00:26:36.124 --> 00:26:43.648]  But juxtapose that with, say, Bill Clinton, a man who violently raped and bit numerous women.
[00:26:44.892 --> 00:26:45.772]  Where was the mainstream media?
[00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:47.153]  And that's the next huge issue.
[00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:48.494]  They've committed all these crimes.
[00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:49.274]  Illegal servers.
[00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:50.295]  Uranium One.
[00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:51.836]  Missing kids in Haiti.
[00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.236]  Pedophile airplanes.
[00:26:53.617 --> 00:26:54.897]  Just endless corruption.
[00:26:54.917 --> 00:26:55.778]  The death list.
[00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:00.000]  DNC staffers shot in the back.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.601]  Just total insanity.
[00:27:02.001 --> 00:27:03.562]  Investigators investigating that.
[00:27:03.662 --> 00:27:04.923]  Shot in the back in D.C.
[00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:06.203]  Run over with cars.
[00:27:06.444 --> 00:27:06.904]  This is like
[00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:08.524]  Well, you have John Brennan,
[00:27:36.943 --> 00:27:47.632]  A psychopath, the former CIA director, a Wahhabi convert, threatening the President of the United States, saying that Mueller's got the goods.
[00:27:47.752 --> 00:27:48.993]  Brandon, you're not in government.
[00:27:49.053 --> 00:27:49.813]  How would you know?
[00:27:49.954 --> 00:27:51.135]  And he did that two weeks ago.
[00:27:51.175 --> 00:27:52.456]  He said, he said, we got the goods.
[00:27:52.476 --> 00:27:53.597]  You better watch your ass.
[00:27:53.717 --> 00:27:55.398]  A president's coming from Mueller.
[00:27:55.558 --> 00:28:00.983]  And he's the same guy that gets up there and says, you better watch your mouth to the president elect.
[00:28:01.203 --> 00:28:03.104]  That's how arrogant these rogue people are.
[00:28:03.384 --> 00:28:04.706]  They think they're the dictators.
[00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:05.466]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:06.067]  You're not.
[00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:11.028]  And if you ever even try to take us all down, know this, you're gonna go down with us, and they know that.
[00:28:11.408 --> 00:28:13.648]  They all know this is an absolute to the end battle.
[00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:16.289]  But the listeners need to get it, and everybody else does.
[00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:17.109]  This isn't a game.
[00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:20.730]  That's why that candy-ass Cavuto pissed his pants and rolled over.
[00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:27.411]  And I'll say this to Sean Hannity, and I'll say this to Tucker Carlson and Dershowitz and people, they got courage.
[00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:30.732]  Find out who the men are around here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:34.337]  That little Weasel Shapiro and all of them, they want to throw up.
[00:28:34.357 --> 00:28:37.218]  We'll be back with Roger Stone and then I'm going to kind of let him talk again, Zach.
[00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:37.978]  I'm just really pissed.
[00:28:38.378 --> 00:28:39.999]  But I'm leaving here soon, but Zach's on lunch.
[00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:42.259]  He's got big intel ties into all this as well.
[00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:43.979]  Again, our power went out earlier.
[00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:45.000]  We're getting everything back on.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.320]  I'm sorry to the TV affiliates, but it's all coming back on.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.921]  We've got a whole system, a whole new system going in to stop this next time.
[00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:55.722]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:28:55.762 --> 00:28:56.062]  Go ahead.
[00:28:56.992 --> 00:28:58.895]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:28:58.935 --> 00:29:08.348]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:29:09.449 --> 00:29:12.814]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:29:13.334 --> 00:29:15.677]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:29:15.897 --> 00:29:18.059]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:29:18.139 --> 00:29:18.520]  Thank you.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.663]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:29:21.703 --> 00:29:25.447]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:29:26.007 --> 00:29:28.990]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.011]  They are quality.
[00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:31.593]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:29:32.093 --> 00:29:34.816]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:35.557]  Absolutely.
[00:29:36.018 --> 00:29:48.940]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:29:53.723 --> 00:30:02.750]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:11.057]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:30:11.237 --> 00:30:15.901]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:30:16.101 --> 00:30:22.824]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:22.884 --> 00:30:29.968]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:30:30.068 --> 00:30:36.931]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:41.433]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:44.775]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend,
[00:30:44.955 --> 00:30:51.104]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:30:51.264 --> 00:30:52.907]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:58.123 --> 00:31:01.225]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:31:01.265 --> 00:31:01.765]  You're on the air.
[00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:02.326]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:02.726 --> 00:31:03.807]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:31:04.027 --> 00:31:04.627]  Hey, brother.
[00:31:04.928 --> 00:31:05.308]  Good, man.
[00:31:05.328 --> 00:31:06.128]  Thank you for calling.
[00:31:06.208 --> 00:31:06.769]  Hey, hey.
[00:31:06.869 --> 00:31:11.072]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:31:11.172 --> 00:31:17.856]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:19.697]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:25.961]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:31:27.022 --> 00:31:28.202]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:31:28.263 --> 00:31:30.704]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[00:31:30.764 --> 00:31:32.264]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:31:32.664 --> 00:31:34.365]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:31:34.725 --> 00:31:35.445]  And exactly.
[00:31:35.465 --> 00:31:39.727]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:31:40.067 --> 00:31:40.347]  Boom!
[00:31:40.488 --> 00:31:43.309]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:31:43.369 --> 00:31:43.909]  It's amazing.
[00:31:43.949 --> 00:31:45.249]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.191]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:56.139]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:31:56.539 --> 00:32:01.685]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:32:01.705 --> 00:32:05.288]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:09.252]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:21.141]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:32.509]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:38.233]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:32:38.573 --> 00:32:41.834]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[00:32:42.374 --> 00:32:43.815]  It's a 360 win.
[00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:49.477]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[00:32:49.757 --> 00:32:51.118]  So please go to the site now.
[00:32:51.558 --> 00:32:53.218]  We need your support.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.663 --> 00:33:11.983]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:18.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:30.247]  That makes the soul feel good.
[00:33:32.688 --> 00:33:38.629]  You know, when they told Robert Plant that song was about devil worship, he got really pissed, because it's the opposite of that.
[00:33:38.729 --> 00:33:39.769]  It's a song against the devil.
[00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.812]  I know Jimmy Page is in the occult and bought Alice O'Crowley's castle.
[00:33:45.152 --> 00:33:46.413]  He said that, intrigued him.
[00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:51.896]  You know, Robert Plant having his son die shortly after that, I think, decided black magic wasn't too cool.
[00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:55.798]  And I've heard that, let's just say, directly from very close sources.
[00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:59.800]  Because you see, there's a wind on down the road.
[00:34:00.881 --> 00:34:02.762]  Our shadows taller than our souls.
[00:34:03.982 --> 00:34:08.245]  There's a lady we all know, who shines white light and once it shows,
[00:34:09.793 --> 00:34:11.654]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:14.775]  I am Alex Jones, your host, going into the enemy attack.
[00:34:15.455 --> 00:34:16.576]  I'm actually excited about it.
[00:34:17.056 --> 00:34:17.856]  I'm enjoying it.
[00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:20.717]  But I'm horrified for the general public.
[00:34:20.737 --> 00:34:22.338]  Now we've got Zach we're going to right now.
[00:34:22.358 --> 00:34:24.779]  Roger's going to be hosting for hours today here.
[00:34:24.799 --> 00:34:25.539]  He was already set up.
[00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:28.000]  We've got our backup power on.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.962]  But we're unable to connect to AT&T and a bunch of other telecoms we're on.
[00:34:33.322 --> 00:34:37.804]  So we'll be able to get video back up on the satellites and streams up maybe the next hour or so.
[00:34:37.884 --> 00:34:40.385]  It's not just us, it's other major hubs in Austin are down.
[00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:41.225]  We are up.
[00:34:41.906 --> 00:34:43.166]  So that was actually part of why we were down.
[00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:46.708]  A lot of our power did kick back on, but we're getting consultants in and more is going in next month.
[00:34:47.368 --> 00:34:54.574]  Roger Stone, unprecedented, historic, attempted coup d'etat against the sitting president, an overthrow of an election, unprecedented.
[00:34:54.975 --> 00:34:56.035]  What do we need to do?
[00:34:56.115 --> 00:34:57.016]  What is the next action?
[00:34:57.056 --> 00:34:59.018]  You are the top story in the country, Chang.
[00:34:59.078 --> 00:35:02.721]  Roger Stone is the main focus, and this is unbelievable.
[00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:06.264]  You know, Alex, it's terrifying.
[00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:11.048]  It really is, to realize the way these federal prosecutors
[00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:20.895]  In violation of the law and the Constitution, you just come in and turn your life completely upside down, destroy people, because they're in the way of the coup d'etat.
[00:35:22.116 --> 00:35:40.809]  My comrade-in-arms, my colleague Michael Caputo, who's appeared here on InfoWars numerous times, as well as giving sage commentary for Fox, and occasionally even on CNN, called before the Senate committee, his finances destroyed, he loses all of his clients,
[00:35:42.032 --> 00:35:46.674]  Multiple death threats, has to put in a new security system at his home.
[00:35:48.195 --> 00:35:50.136]  We got guys on the roof with rifles!
[00:35:50.956 --> 00:35:53.317]  I mean, you know what I've had to do?
[00:35:53.377 --> 00:35:54.438]  You know who we go around with.
[00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:56.739]  It's extraordinary.
[00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:02.602]  This guy has to dip into his children's college, you know, savings fund, try to stay alive.
[00:36:03.422 --> 00:36:07.784]  Yesterday, day before yesterday, pulled in by Robert Mueller.
[00:36:09.161 --> 00:36:14.525]  We don't have the details of that, but Caputo's press stand-ups I think were very effective.
[00:36:14.545 --> 00:36:15.745]  He called it exactly.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.901]  This looking into torture by the CIA, no consequences whatsoever.
[00:36:45.122 --> 00:36:48.022]  Also, purged himself about it when asked under oath.
[00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:49.303]  And they purged themselves.
[00:36:49.363 --> 00:36:50.763]  And you're going to be hosting continually.
[00:36:51.063 --> 00:36:56.345]  Just to be clear here, we're going to go to Zach here briefly, but ladies and gentlemen, this is all cut and dry.
[00:36:56.645 --> 00:36:57.645]  They're making their move.
[00:36:57.705 --> 00:36:58.806]  They're not going to stop.
[00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:00.226]  They're not going to back down.
[00:37:00.246 --> 00:37:01.066]  They're not going to quit.
[00:37:01.407 --> 00:37:02.447]  You advise the president.
[00:37:02.927 --> 00:37:04.328]  Of course they want to know about your private conversations.
[00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:05.470]  There, they recorded the whole damn thing.
[00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.471]  They're never about Russiagate.
[00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:08.192]  But I know, don't trust them.
[00:37:08.212 --> 00:37:09.274]  They're never going to back down.
[00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:10.194]  They're never going to stop.
[00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:11.095]  They're criminals.
[00:37:11.135 --> 00:37:12.056]  You must prosecute them.
[00:37:12.217 --> 00:37:13.918]  They've got my phone calls recorded to the President.
[00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:20.085]  And, you know, I'm telling him every time, just, sir, you don't have to call up and wish me and my wife that we're getting married.
[00:37:20.425 --> 00:37:20.765]  Please.
[00:37:21.526 --> 00:37:24.910]  All I want to tell you is, you need to know they're never going to stop.
[00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.591]  They're never going to quit because you're removing their coup.
[00:37:27.651 --> 00:37:28.432]  I know you know that.
[00:37:28.712 --> 00:37:33.135]  That they hate your guts because you actually are self-made and came to power as a maverick.
[00:37:33.175 --> 00:37:39.699]  They are the disgusting, arrogant mental patients and they hate you and they're going to tell you that this thing's going to be all over.
[00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:40.440]  It's lies.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.100]  It's lies.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.541]  Your lawyers are lying to you.
[00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:43.521]  They are lying to you.
[00:37:43.822 --> 00:37:44.842]  Okay, okay, Alex.
[00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:45.703]  Yes, yes, I get it.
[00:37:45.943 --> 00:37:49.785]  Yeah, McCain, he's not too good of a guy, is he?
[00:37:50.306 --> 00:37:51.987]  And now he understands though, doesn't he, Roger?
[00:37:53.024 --> 00:37:55.024]  I really think he has seen the light.
[00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:57.845]  I think he's gotten his sea legs as president.
[00:37:58.405 --> 00:37:59.365]  He got rid of H.R.
[00:37:59.385 --> 00:38:04.546]  McMaster, the National Security Advisor who was direct pipeline to George Soros.
[00:38:05.246 --> 00:38:14.808]  Came from a foundation financed by Soros to his- And by the way, I'm not bragging the reason we got dead marks on our head, Roger and I. We blew that operation.
[00:38:14.848 --> 00:38:15.768]  We got that to Trump.
[00:38:15.808 --> 00:38:16.829]  We exposed the whole thing.
[00:38:17.209 --> 00:38:18.349]  We blew McMaster out.
[00:38:19.842 --> 00:38:20.483]  No question.
[00:38:20.623 --> 00:38:36.652]  Once we went public with the fact that he drunkenly at a public dinner said the president was a moron, that he had the intelligence of a child, and that he and McMaster, his job was to stop Donald Trump from blowing up the Earth.
[00:38:37.092 --> 00:38:46.298]  Hey, McMaster, Donald Trump just engineered peace in North Korea, something Bill Clinton told people was literally impossible, could not be done.
[00:38:47.602 --> 00:38:57.844]  Now the president's gotten rid of the other globalist lightweight Rex Tillerson, who thought the Iran deal was just peachy keen.
[00:38:57.864 --> 00:39:01.805]  And we're going to come back to you on that, why they hate Trump, because they're the agents of chaos.
[00:39:01.845 --> 00:39:03.666]  They know they can fix things if they wanted to.
[00:39:03.946 --> 00:39:04.866]  They've been continuing this.
[00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:05.506]  Roger, stay there.
[00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:06.046]  We'll put you on hold.
[00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:08.087]  Coming back, Zach, thanks for holding for 30 minutes.
[00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:12.588]  We've had major technical difficulties, obviously, with huge tornado storms blasting everything out.
[00:39:12.628 --> 00:39:13.808]  Our backup system's failing.
[00:39:13.828 --> 00:39:14.828]  We've got engineers in here.
[00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:17.029]  Thanks to all the TV and radio folks for staying with us.
[00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:21.052]  We're getting better systems in, but we need lesser support, obviously, to be able to do that.
[00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:26.156]  You've got big breaking news, but just on the ongoing coup against the American people.
[00:39:26.176 --> 00:39:27.257]  This is a coup against America.
[00:39:27.297 --> 00:39:27.938]  That's what they should be.
[00:39:28.498 --> 00:39:30.520]  Clinton-Mueller coup against America.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.121]  Deep state coup against America.
[00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:35.824]  What do you make of the current intel and what's your information?
[00:39:35.844 --> 00:39:39.307]  And then we're going to get into the laser attacks on our aircraft and more.
[00:39:40.928 --> 00:39:41.489]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:42.851]  It's great to be back on with you.
[00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:44.633]  I mean, just an amazing time to be alive.
[00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:45.794]  We are in the fight as we speak.
[00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:51.141]  We have volcanoes erupting, massive storms moving across the U.S., firefights going on in Saudi Arabia, where the U.S.
[00:39:51.201 --> 00:39:52.523]  is protecting their investments there.
[00:39:52.543 --> 00:39:53.284]  Listen,
[00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:56.432]  Not to mention a coup d'etat in the White House.
[00:39:57.053 --> 00:40:06.639]  All while you have that intellectual snake in the grass, Ben Shapiro, slithering out there in the ether, trying to stop free thinkers from perpetuating what's going to happen inevitably.
[00:40:06.959 --> 00:40:11.082]  There's a real problem with the Ben Shapiro thing, but there's so much news in the forefront that I've got to get into the intel.
[00:40:11.782 --> 00:40:14.604]  And I've got to get back to Ben Shapiro, because that's a real problem.
[00:40:14.644 --> 00:40:17.686]  We have a mutual POC there, a mutual point of contact with Joe Rogan.
[00:40:17.846 --> 00:40:19.988]  I'm calling out Ben Shapiro right now, and I want him to hear this.
[00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:22.196]  It needs to be this right now.
[00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:26.318]  It needs to be Jones vs. Shapiro, a full debate, and Joe Rogan as the moderator.
[00:40:26.438 --> 00:40:28.218]  Joe Rogan knows Ben very well.
[00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:29.659]  He respects Ben.
[00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:31.019]  And he is friends with you.
[00:40:31.279 --> 00:40:32.340]  That has to happen.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.820]  It has to happen.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.081]  That little intellectual snake in the grass.
[00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:37.961]  And I'll stop right there and we'll get into the intel.
[00:40:38.001 --> 00:40:38.601]  I just had to say that.
[00:40:38.621 --> 00:40:39.102]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:39.922 --> 00:40:40.162]  Go ahead.
[00:40:41.536 --> 00:40:51.269]  Okay, so what we have, all while this coup d'etat and all hell is breaking loose in the White House and around the world, we have the Pentagon confirming that Chinese have fired lasers at U.S.
[00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:52.290]  pilots in Djibouti.
[00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:55.214]  Okay, this is the official line coming out of the White House.
[00:40:55.234 --> 00:40:56.736]  You said that on air a couple months ago.
[00:40:56.796 --> 00:40:59.680]  You said they were firing lasers at our satellites and at our aircraft.
[00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:10.603]  So Dana White, the press secretary for the Pentagon, releases the information that the number of incidents is more than two, but less than ten of the laser firings that took place in recent weeks.
[00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:12.783]  How the hell is that possible?
[00:41:12.823 --> 00:41:18.005]  So we strike Syria over false flags, but China's shooting down our airmen with lasers and nothing happens.
[00:41:18.266 --> 00:41:20.706]  Meanwhile, Sessions and the FBI is compromised in our country.
[00:41:20.927 --> 00:41:21.987]  What the hell is going on?
[00:41:22.387 --> 00:41:23.468]  It's brilliant.
[00:41:38.928 --> 00:41:39.428]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:39.448 --> 00:41:43.830]  $2.3 trillion are missing the day before 9-11 happens, folks.
[00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.052]  This weekend is going to be as active as it can be, and this is not all happening in a vacuum.
[00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:52.174]  This is coordinated, this is a problem, this is a flanking maneuver, and we are under big attack here.
[00:41:52.314 --> 00:41:53.214]  This is unprecedented.
[00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:54.755]  There's so much going on at once.
[00:41:57.532 --> 00:42:01.655]  I know there's been discussions reportedly by the President if they try a coup against him.
[00:42:02.095 --> 00:42:03.857]  And we know the military is already in D.C.
[00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:05.618]  I mean, I'm not looking for this.
[00:42:05.658 --> 00:42:08.320]  They're the ones that have a police state where they want to overthrow our elected government.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.244]  I mean, I think like George Washington, Trump needs to take the gloves off now against these coup plotters.
[00:42:14.885 --> 00:42:16.066]  I don't think if or when.
[00:42:16.086 --> 00:42:16.766]  I think it's happening.
[00:42:16.786 --> 00:42:18.147]  I think we're in it right now.
[00:42:19.048 --> 00:42:21.970]  We're so close to the elephant, we don't know what we're looking at here.
[00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:23.932]  What's going on right now?
[00:42:24.913 --> 00:42:25.573]  We're in it.
[00:42:25.593 --> 00:42:25.573]  100%.
[00:42:25.734 --> 00:42:27.494]  It's happening right now.
[00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:29.275]  And we're hinting at it.
[00:42:29.295 --> 00:42:29.996]  We're getting at it.
[00:42:30.516 --> 00:42:32.357]  They hinted that Tillerson has been removed.
[00:42:32.697 --> 00:42:33.677]  Of course he's been removed.
[00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:34.638]  But what about Sessions?
[00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:35.458]  What about Mueller?
[00:42:35.738 --> 00:42:37.519]  He is the chief executive.
[00:42:37.779 --> 00:42:38.079]  Period.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.380]  Go in there and fire him.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.681]  This is our time in history.
[00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:42.882]  It has to be done.
[00:42:42.982 --> 00:42:44.262]  We'll be back with Zach.
[00:42:44.322 --> 00:42:49.365]  Roger Stone exclusively here with the big giant news here in the InfoWars bunker.
[00:42:49.645 --> 00:42:50.645]  InfoWars.com.
[00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:51.486]  NewsWars.com.
[00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:58.642]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[00:42:58.722 --> 00:43:01.783]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[00:43:01.843 --> 00:43:04.123]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[00:43:04.744 --> 00:43:06.224]  What is the latest from the UK?
[00:43:06.324 --> 00:43:14.886]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[00:43:14.906 --> 00:43:19.088]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:22.029]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:23.449]  It would have been mad!
[00:43:24.049 --> 00:43:31.735]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:34.196]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[00:43:34.757 --> 00:43:36.498]  Trust Middle England.
[00:43:36.918 --> 00:43:38.379]  Trust Middle America.
[00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:42.162]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[00:43:42.502 --> 00:43:46.385]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[00:43:46.945 --> 00:43:47.826]  All I can tell her
[00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:57.192]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[00:43:57.212 --> 00:43:58.272]  Let's put it like this.
[00:43:58.812 --> 00:44:07.658]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[00:44:08.158 --> 00:44:13.501]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[00:44:13.941 --> 00:44:26.788]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[00:44:26.828 --> 00:44:28.969]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:30.210]  You're a leading expert on this.
[00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.171]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:33.412]  Why are they trying to flood?
[00:44:34.434 --> 00:44:35.574]  Because they hate Christianity.
[00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:47.178]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[00:44:47.238 --> 00:44:48.059]  They deny that.
[00:44:48.499 --> 00:44:52.160]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.400]  They want to get rid of it.
[00:44:53.901 --> 00:45:01.843]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:03.904]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[00:45:04.637 --> 00:45:09.801]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:15.845]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:24.412]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:30.196]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[00:45:30.236 --> 00:45:31.417]  And look, what's really happening here?
[00:45:31.917 --> 00:45:33.739]  You know, don't underestimate
[00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:37.282]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:38.683]  The victory of Brexit.
[00:45:38.963 --> 00:45:39.884]  The victory of Trump.
[00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:41.345]  You know, we're winning.
[00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:42.766]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:50.632]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[00:45:50.712 --> 00:45:51.513]  And you know something?
[00:45:52.053 --> 00:45:52.854]  If we can resist,
[00:45:53.656 --> 00:46:02.762]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[00:46:02.822 --> 00:46:04.543]  So don't get down, everybody.
[00:46:04.843 --> 00:46:05.704]  Don't get depressed.
[00:46:06.044 --> 00:46:08.526]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:15.135]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came and privately cheered him up and cheered up the troops.
[00:46:15.455 --> 00:46:18.258]  And you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[00:46:18.538 --> 00:46:19.199]  You're amazing.
[00:46:19.419 --> 00:46:20.120]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:20.981]  I know you're very busy.
[00:46:21.561 --> 00:46:22.923]  But that's as the EU has said.
[00:46:22.963 --> 00:46:25.445]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[00:46:25.485 --> 00:46:28.869]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[00:46:30.107 --> 00:46:42.780]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.626]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[00:46:49.086 --> 00:46:50.428]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[00:46:56.684 --> 00:47:01.268]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:09.916]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.936 --> 00:47:19.424]  It's hard to turn that off.
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:27.310]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:28.991 --> 00:47:33.413]  Massive storm, frenetic forces hit Austin, powers off in half the city till 4 o'clock.
[00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:37.894]  We've got our backup power on, but we don't have connections out.
[00:47:38.014 --> 00:47:45.197]  It looks like AT&T and Zoit's Telecom and Google and I don't want to list all the carriers we've got.
[00:47:45.237 --> 00:47:49.078]  We got, they got a lot of, we got five systems.
[00:47:49.819 --> 00:47:53.300]  Satellites, transceivers, and a lot of other stuff.
[00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:56.587]  Well, I don't want to give everything away.
[00:47:57.287 --> 00:47:59.429]  We had to, we had to go across town to a whole other studio.
[00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:03.372]  Oh yeah, we know we're in a war, folks, but whatever.
[00:48:03.652 --> 00:48:08.796]  The town is down, so we don't have all the connections right here, though we do have the satellite on the roof.
[00:48:10.017 --> 00:48:13.880]  So, we're on TV, but it's just audio, but that'll be up soon.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.020]  Roger Stone's here with us.
[00:48:15.081 --> 00:48:19.264]  If I sound excited, it's like the excitement of adrenaline and horror.
[00:48:20.401 --> 00:48:21.643]  Have you ever seen something really horrible happen?
[00:48:21.663 --> 00:48:24.406]  You're not happy about it, but you have adrenaline pumping?
[00:48:25.147 --> 00:48:30.714]  You know, like your arms giantly sliced open, blood spraying over the walls, but it's like you kind of feel interested, kind of feels cool.
[00:48:30.954 --> 00:48:32.616]  Not the pain, but wow, you're really alive.
[00:48:33.197 --> 00:48:37.903]  That's kind of what this is like, because if America and the world, the whole world ought to be freaked out right now.
[00:48:38.343 --> 00:48:41.166]  Doesn't get upset about the rogue deep state completely out of control.
[00:48:41.666 --> 00:48:58.381]  Illegally spying on Trump, lying about everything, lying to Congress, doing everything they claim Trump did in triplicate, openly saying they want to get rid of free speech, have new elections, suspend everybody that got elected last time, bring in federal control of elections, that's what Obama did, and end this republic as we know it going the way of Venezuela.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.782]  Where they have, you know, multi-thousand percent inflation every week.
[00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:03.903]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:49:03.923 --> 00:49:11.329]  So Roger Stone and Zach, both of you guys, Roger, if we don't respond now, call Congress, call...
[00:49:12.643 --> 00:49:20.130]  Everywhere, and get really, really upset, and call talk radio, and call C-SPAN, and not be these Cavuto types that kind of hedge their bets, and go, oh, Trump's kind of the swamp.
[00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:23.653]  He didn't technically sign the most bills in the first year.
[00:49:23.733 --> 00:49:28.277]  Yeah, but he got the biggest changes, and the biggest major bills, and the most money changed.
[00:49:28.897 --> 00:49:31.340]  So I would say Trump's done the most in the last 100 years.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.001]  But here it is, Fox News.
[00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:35.403]  Federal judge accuses Mueller team of lying.
[00:49:35.603 --> 00:49:35.984]  Oh, really?
[00:49:36.464 --> 00:49:37.385]  Mueller's famous for that.
[00:49:37.965 --> 00:49:38.986]  Trying to target Trump.
[00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:43.030]  He's a famous crook who goes out and orders people to lie or they'll go to prison.
[00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:43.530]  He's been caught.
[00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:55.081]  A federal judge on Friday harshly rebuked special counsel Robert Mueller's team during a hearing for ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, suggesting they lied about the scope of the investigation, are seeking unfettered power.
[00:49:56.002 --> 00:49:57.983]  Federal judge, you want unfettered power.
[00:49:58.244 --> 00:49:59.225]  Another branch of government.
[00:49:59.265 --> 00:49:59.725]  These are quotes.
[00:49:59.905 --> 00:50:00.566]  What do I say?
[00:50:01.907 --> 00:50:02.347]  Rogue.
[00:50:02.868 --> 00:50:03.448]  Runaway.
[00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:04.910]  That means unfettered, untethered.
[00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:11.329]  Rogue, out of control, their own power, and are more interested in bringing down the President.
[00:50:11.449 --> 00:50:13.071]  You don't really care about Mr. Manafort.
[00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:13.591]  U.S.
[00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:14.533]  District Judge T.S.
[00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:24.124]  Ellis III, he'll probably die in a plane crash or something, told Mueller's team, you really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment or whatever.
[00:50:24.144 --> 00:50:25.146]  And the Democrats have said that.
[00:50:25.566 --> 00:50:27.407]  First of all, I think Zack's right on the money.
[00:50:27.427 --> 00:50:28.368]  The coup d'etat is afoot right now.
[00:50:28.388 --> 00:50:28.988]  It's going down.
[00:50:29.088 --> 00:50:29.708]  Even as we speak.
[00:50:51.039 --> 00:51:02.890]  If you look at this historically, what's different between this coup d'etat, the one they staged in 1963 when they took down John Kennedy, or the one they staged in 1974 when they took down Richard Dixon?
[00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:06.553]  The difference, in all honesty, Alex, is info wars.
[00:51:07.053 --> 00:51:08.835]  The difference is the Internet.
[00:51:09.455 --> 00:51:15.861]  The difference is they no longer have the monopoly on communication in the country that they enjoyed in 1963.
[00:51:17.755 --> 00:51:18.035]  In 1974.
[00:51:19.056 --> 00:51:24.557]  You couldn't find a newspaper or a television report that would tell the truth about what was going on.
[00:51:25.398 --> 00:51:28.879]  Now, they've figured out that that's the difference.
[00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:31.160]  So they want to dial it back.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.721]  Want to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[00:51:34.241 --> 00:51:35.841]  We've got to shut Infowars down.
[00:51:36.282 --> 00:51:37.682]  Got to get them off the internet.
[00:51:38.142 --> 00:51:42.584]  Got to get all conservatives, Daily Caller, Breitbart, Town Hall, Gateway Funded.
[00:51:42.804 --> 00:51:44.044]  We've got to close them down.
[00:51:44.124 --> 00:51:44.824]  They're dangerous.
[00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.185]  They're dangerous because
[00:51:47.884 --> 00:51:56.152]  And by the way, we need Daily Caller and Gateway Pundit and WorldNetDaily and Breitbart.
[00:51:56.172 --> 00:51:56.913]  They've done it some.
[00:51:57.133 --> 00:51:59.776]  Every day come to InfoWarsDefense.
[00:52:00.377 --> 00:52:04.421]  They've got all their whisper campaigns out about don't support us, we're bad, lie about what we say, all this other crap.
[00:52:05.649 --> 00:52:10.112]  You know, threatening people, threatening Project Veritas to not be associated with us, Politico, all this.
[00:52:10.492 --> 00:52:11.853]  And then they've got a talking point out.
[00:52:12.233 --> 00:52:13.454]  Jones must be censored.
[00:52:13.494 --> 00:52:14.055]  He's criminal.
[00:52:14.335 --> 00:52:16.176]  He's like video games causing mass shootings.
[00:52:16.196 --> 00:52:16.776]  That's what they're saying.
[00:52:17.077 --> 00:52:18.518]  He's got to be taken off the air.
[00:52:18.878 --> 00:52:21.279]  They have professors all over the news.
[00:52:21.299 --> 00:52:23.041]  I mean, it's in my local paper everywhere.
[00:52:23.521 --> 00:52:24.762]  It's all the same talking point.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.601]  That we must be taken off the air because Jones can mind control people.
[00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:31.282]  It actually says it in the Slate article.
[00:52:32.062 --> 00:52:37.024]  It says Jones is able to take control of their minds with archetypal manipulation.
[00:52:37.044 --> 00:52:39.985]  And we need a bipartisan effort to quote
[00:52:42.233 --> 00:52:51.297]  Shut down free speech, an approach that needs to go beyond censorship and Snopes fact-checking, saying they're the arbiter, but completely shutting us down.
[00:52:51.677 --> 00:52:53.818]  And so many of these professors are Antifa.
[00:52:53.858 --> 00:52:56.379]  I don't know if this guy is, but he sure fits the bill.
[00:52:56.399 --> 00:53:01.721]  It's purportedly his picture, this professor, Alan Lenovitz.
[00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:06.446]  Assisted professor of James Madison University and the author of The Gluten Lie.
[00:53:06.466 --> 00:53:07.107]  I guess it's E-E.
[00:53:07.447 --> 00:53:11.251]  Again, it's all about how they control reality and now they're saying a heartbeat isn't life.
[00:53:11.312 --> 00:53:17.519]  Planned Parenthood said so and there there is no mother and father and we got a professor lady at UT saying masculinity doesn't exist.
[00:53:17.899 --> 00:53:18.860]  Men don't exist.
[00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:19.742]  This is a
[00:53:20.162 --> 00:53:30.135]  A total gaslighting mind control with him saying we're going to shut your speech down if you don't agree with us and they've picked Infowars as the scarlet letter book to burn first.
[00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:31.396]  I am honored, Roger.
[00:53:31.697 --> 00:53:32.318]  I know you are.
[00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:33.519]  Let's get Zach's take on this.
[00:53:33.579 --> 00:53:35.081]  Zach, you say the coup's afoot.
[00:53:35.862 --> 00:53:37.262]  We know it's a foot against Trump.
[00:53:37.282 --> 00:53:37.743]  They admit it.
[00:53:37.803 --> 00:53:39.603]  It's in all the documents, the fake dossier.
[00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:40.804]  They're accelerating it all.
[00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:42.684]  But how about countering them?
[00:53:42.764 --> 00:53:45.145]  They're trying to destroy our elected president.
[00:53:45.485 --> 00:53:50.246]  They're trying to say that he can be indicted and removed for that by Mueller himself outside of impeachment.
[00:53:50.466 --> 00:53:54.528]  You've seen Brennan and all of them on TV six months ago saying he'll be gone by December.
[00:53:54.728 --> 00:53:55.648]  He's not gone.
[00:53:55.688 --> 00:53:59.269]  He's hanging on and getting stronger and the economy's coming back.
[00:53:59.429 --> 00:54:01.970]  We're getting major peace deals and you're so pissed
[00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:06.211]  That you had your foot on the country for decades, sucking a stride to build your world government.
[00:54:06.371 --> 00:54:11.013]  You were all hired by foreign megabanks, because you're a bunch of America-hating, pseudo-intellectual trash.
[00:54:11.233 --> 00:54:17.695]  And now you're getting your asses politically kicked, and you're crapping your doors all over the place, because we're awaking the sleeping giant, and you don't like it!
[00:54:17.855 --> 00:54:18.436]  Well, guess what?
[00:54:18.596 --> 00:54:21.437]  You're gonna lose anyway you slice it, you dumb bastards!
[00:54:21.657 --> 00:54:22.217]  Go ahead, Zach.
[00:54:23.607 --> 00:54:25.969]  Absolutely, and you're on fire, Roger's on fire.
[00:54:26.149 --> 00:54:29.191]  What just happened was the cornerstone of the entire war here.
[00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:33.533]  You see, what they're operating under is a collage of chaos tactics.
[00:54:34.074 --> 00:54:40.898]  So many, so many stories that happen multiple times a day, over the weeks, over the years, that you cannot focus or keep up with anything.
[00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:42.179]  Information apocalypse.
[00:54:42.399 --> 00:54:43.480]  Information apocalypse.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:48.682]  What Roger just did, and what we do on InfoWars all the time, is tied together in a perpetual timeline.
[00:54:48.742 --> 00:54:49.783]  It's all tied together.
[00:54:50.183 --> 00:54:53.905]  Because, you know, you could focus on one thing... They want to keep you, in the moment, confused.
[00:54:53.945 --> 00:54:54.925]  I mean, that's what Gruber said.
[00:54:54.965 --> 00:54:55.986]  It's all about confusing us.
[00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:56.826]  Fog of war.
[00:54:57.006 --> 00:54:58.567]  But we've got the enemy battle map.
[00:54:58.587 --> 00:55:00.288]  We're not even looking at what they're projecting.
[00:55:00.488 --> 00:55:02.089]  We've got their battle map, and that's what they hate.
[00:55:03.197 --> 00:55:03.617]  Exactly.
[00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:08.780]  So we could say, like, this is not about Iran, this is about Mars.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.323]  Meaning, this is about attacking Elon, attacking the human evolution, attacking where we're going, playing this other game.
[00:55:14.383 --> 00:55:23.087]  This is already an AI system that made the decision to have a post-human world, and Trump has jumped in with others and are saying, no, we're not doing it at the elite level.
[00:55:24.703 --> 00:55:26.503]  You know, none of this happens in a vacuum.
[00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:28.684]  None of this happens in singular movements.
[00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:29.544]  It's all connected.
[00:55:29.584 --> 00:55:30.904]  We've already forgotten about Vegas.
[00:55:31.124 --> 00:55:33.185]  They rolled Parkland out, so what happened to Vegas?
[00:55:33.265 --> 00:55:35.525]  That's just, it's unsolved, no big deal.
[00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:36.846]  We know what happened to do with the Saudis.
[00:55:36.886 --> 00:55:40.927]  Now they're having firefights there in Saudi Arabia, and it's going to get us into war with Iran.
[00:55:40.947 --> 00:55:43.147]  And they don't want us to question the next false flag.
[00:55:43.187 --> 00:55:44.307]  That's what they're really pissed about.
[00:55:44.327 --> 00:55:46.548]  That's why I said Parkland didn't happen.
[00:55:46.568 --> 00:55:47.408]  Well, I didn't say that.
[00:55:48.496 --> 00:55:50.037]  This, and this is all tied together.
[00:55:50.057 --> 00:55:56.883]  This is Donald Trump's life work and the coup d'etat is there and this is the only chance that we have of a second American revolution because if not, globalism will be secure.
[00:55:56.903 --> 00:55:59.565]  I think Americans should all go to their capitals.
[00:55:59.625 --> 00:56:00.145]  Don't wait.
[00:56:00.365 --> 00:56:01.006]  Live stream it.
[00:56:01.086 --> 00:56:02.307]  One person, then two, then ten.
[00:56:02.627 --> 00:56:03.488]  Everyone today.
[00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:04.889]  The president has the power.
[00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:06.270]  That's what freaks them out.
[00:56:33.533 --> 00:56:43.582]  People need to realize that if it's Infowars today, if it's Alex Jones today that they silence Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Breitbart.
[00:56:43.622 --> 00:56:46.765]  And only Matt Drudge has come to Infowars main defense.
[00:56:46.825 --> 00:56:47.386]  He gets it.
[00:56:47.706 --> 00:56:49.387]  Why don't these people get it?
[00:56:49.968 --> 00:56:51.670]  I'm not trying to be bigger than any of them.
[00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:52.971]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[00:56:54.281 --> 00:56:56.843]  Sean Hannity just needs to recognize.
[00:56:57.164 --> 00:57:03.609]  You don't have to agree with Alex Jones on everything, but if they get Alex today, Sean, they're coming for you tomorrow!
[00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:04.950]  Wake up!
[00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:06.452]  Wake up!
[00:57:06.812 --> 00:57:07.673]  I like Sean Hannity.
[00:57:08.113 --> 00:57:09.434]  I think he's fearless.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:10.956]  No, no, I like Sean Hannity too.
[00:57:10.976 --> 00:57:11.496]  I like them all.
[00:57:11.516 --> 00:57:13.798]  What I'm saying is, they're coming for everybody.
[00:57:15.419 --> 00:57:17.962]  But they think this is just a fight against us.
[00:57:18.664 --> 00:57:21.807]  They think, well, Infowars, you know, they're dispensable.
[00:57:21.847 --> 00:57:22.287]  No, we aren't.
[00:57:22.788 --> 00:57:24.929]  We're just the first one on their tech list.
[00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:26.671]  They're going to shut down Fox.
[00:57:26.691 --> 00:57:27.852]  They're going to take down Tucker.
[00:57:27.872 --> 00:57:29.293]  They're going to take down Sean Hannity.
[00:57:29.773 --> 00:57:36.579]  They're going to take down- And by the way, you're the guy that told Trump this was always going to happen and the obstruction crap, and now you're the main target of Mueller.
[00:57:36.779 --> 00:57:39.101]  The main target of Mueller is on with us now!
[00:57:39.121 --> 00:57:41.163]  But they don't want him to have a voice.
[00:57:41.303 --> 00:57:43.825]  We'll be right back to finish up with Zach, and then Roger takes over.
[00:57:44.506 --> 00:57:46.387]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:57:46.427 --> 00:57:46.728]  Go ahead.
[00:57:47.641 --> 00:57:49.543]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:57:49.563 --> 00:57:58.992]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:58:00.093 --> 00:58:03.457]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:58:03.977 --> 00:58:06.318]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:58:06.538 --> 00:58:08.680]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:09.180]  Thank you.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.322]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:58:12.342 --> 00:58:16.084]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:58:16.644 --> 00:58:19.625]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:20.646]  They are quality.
[00:58:20.986 --> 00:58:22.227]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:58:22.727 --> 00:58:25.449]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:26.149]  Absolutely.
[00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:39.583]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:58:44.418 --> 00:58:48.000]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:49.601]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:58:49.641 --> 00:58:51.342]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:58:51.603 --> 00:58:54.004]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:58:54.044 --> 00:58:54.965]  We've beaten six.
[00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:57.226]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:58:57.927 --> 00:58:58.647]  You're my soldier.
[00:58:58.687 --> 00:58:59.408]  We're all in this together.
[00:59:00.459 --> 00:59:05.161]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:06.562]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:59:06.582 --> 00:59:17.788]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, word slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[00:59:17.828 --> 00:59:19.969]  And when you financially go to Infowarsstore.com,

[00:59:39.845 --> 00:59:42.027]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:42.387 --> 00:59:43.608]  Please, shop with the good guys.
[00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:52.724]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:10.713]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:22.180]  Changing history.
[01:00:27.853 --> 01:00:28.734]  Clutch bringing us in.
[01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.615]  Roger Stone is on phone.
[01:00:30.635 --> 01:00:31.955]  He was set to already host today.
[01:00:31.975 --> 01:00:39.760]  I had a bunch of corporate and family things to take care of, but when this all happened, I came in to do the show, because he can't be via his nice HD studio in Florida.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.541]  He's on the phone, but we're gonna dial it in.
[01:00:41.561 --> 01:00:44.482]  Let's get Owen Froyer in here to take over, so we got HD.
[01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:45.603]  Our storms hit Texas.
[01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:46.784]  We're getting booted back up.
[01:00:47.184 --> 01:00:50.086]  Thanks to all the TV and radio affiliates, we're getting even more redundant systems put in.
[01:00:50.406 --> 01:00:51.206]  Oh look, the Skype's up.
[01:00:51.246 --> 01:00:52.467]  They're starting to get it set up right now.
[01:00:52.787 --> 01:00:53.928]  So he'll be ready soon.
[01:00:55.028 --> 01:00:56.869]  But I guess that's not going out yet, so it's not ready.
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:58.890]  Pardon me?
[01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.691]  Owen is in Dallas at the NRA event.
[01:01:02.711 --> 01:01:03.071]  Good God.
[01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:03.671]  Well, we can have him.
[01:01:05.092 --> 01:01:06.472]  We'll have him pop in then, too.
[01:01:06.933 --> 01:01:09.994]  Okay, Zach, finish up as Roger's taking over in the next segment.
[01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:11.574]  We really appreciate you.
[01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:13.915]  I don't want to seem happy about everything that's going on.
[01:01:13.955 --> 01:01:16.296]  I'm really upset, but I understand that the war is here.
[01:01:16.836 --> 01:01:17.216]  It's now.
[01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:18.477]  Anything else you'd like to add, Zach?
[01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:20.236]  Absolutely.
[01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:22.837]  I mean, that's the tactic, the collage of chaos.
[01:01:22.877 --> 01:01:31.921]  And the reason you're being attacked, the reason Roger Stone specifically is being attacked in the Truth and Liberty movement, is because they're operating under a collage of chaos and we have the timeline.
[01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:42.886]  We can place everything on a timeline, tie it all together, prove it to the public and show them what's going on, because with the instant gratification, the attention span of the society, this is what they're hoping for.
[01:01:43.046 --> 01:01:47.188]  So we keep on reminding and red-pulling individuals, so this is why you all... Isn't an attention span...
[01:01:48.669 --> 01:01:50.153]  An attention span is like consciousness.
[01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:54.224]  Without an attention span, there's no timeline, and those of us that have an attention span are the enemy.
[01:01:55.174 --> 01:02:03.998]  100%.
[01:01:55.254 --> 01:02:03.998]  I mean, with this whole thing in North Korea, peace on the Korean Peninsula, it's the most sensational story in world history for 50 to 100 years.
[01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:07.079]  But we have to remember this.
[01:02:07.139 --> 01:02:10.120]  Donald Trump, this is his life's work.
[01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:15.023]  Donald Trump, before he was President of the United States, was running a reality show in a business empire.
[01:02:15.183 --> 01:02:19.464]  During that reality show, he was running The Celebrity Apprentice, and in 2009, who did he have on as a guest?
[01:02:19.805 --> 01:02:20.585]  Dennis Rodman.
[01:02:21.065 --> 01:02:21.285]  Okay.
[01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:22.486]  People need to understand this.
[01:02:22.686 --> 01:02:25.548]  Dennis Rodman was influential and important in this North Korea deal.
[01:02:25.828 --> 01:02:28.950]  As stupid as that sounds, as crazy as it sounds, it actually happened.
[01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.390]  Okay.
[01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.751]  And why would he bring Dennis Rodman on the Celebrity Apprentice?
[01:02:31.811 --> 01:02:32.692]  He had this in the works.
[01:02:32.732 --> 01:02:33.592]  He knew he was going to run.
[01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.574]  Dennis Rodman was North Korea what Kanye West is to black America.
[01:02:36.874 --> 01:02:38.075]  This is his life's work.
[01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:39.576]  It's very strategic.
[01:02:39.816 --> 01:02:41.217]  It doesn't happen in a vacuum.
[01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:42.818]  And he is under attack.
[01:02:42.998 --> 01:02:50.163]  This is our only chance, and for all the hate, for all the criticism, for all that's going on, we need to double down and support Donald Trump because we will never have a shot like we do right now.
[01:02:50.223 --> 01:02:53.646]  We have got, got, got to go for broke right now.
[01:02:53.826 --> 01:02:54.086]  Period.
[01:02:54.775 --> 01:03:02.343]  They are going for broke, and again, I didn't understand the Rodman thing, that separate groups were using him, that he actually did a good job.
[01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:03.885]  I thought he was just there liking the dictator.
[01:03:04.565 --> 01:03:13.094]  We're all exponentially learning, and now we know that Trump has been plotting this for decades, hoping somebody else would turn the country around, and now this has happened.
[01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:15.737]  I've confirmed it with the people that were involved that got Trump to run.
[01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:20.944]  And, you know, it's like he said, you come highly recommended, and I will not let you down.
[01:03:21.305 --> 01:03:33.042]  He was like, to our audience, reporting for duty like a soldier, absolutely committing to this, but he has been hamstrung by his lawyers and the lack of capability to find good personnel that have his medal.
[01:03:34.366 --> 01:03:40.952]  He has been hamstrung by the entire timeline, the momentum of all of the events of the deep state since John F. Kennedy, okay?
[01:03:41.312 --> 01:03:44.374]  Since that moment, he is dealing with all of the force of that.
[01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:45.635]  So we need to double down.
[01:03:45.675 --> 01:03:48.718]  We need to realize that it's not just individual attacks.
[01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.159]  This is all interconnected.
[01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:54.283]  And the reason what they're doing and what they're trying to stifle is us going to the stars.
[01:03:54.323 --> 01:04:00.788]  It's no coincidence that while you're under attack, while Donald Trump's under attack, while Roger Stone's under attack, Elon Musk is even under attack by the mainstream media.
[01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:05.291]  They're driving down his stocks right now because they want to break away civilization in their own admission.
[01:04:05.331 --> 01:04:08.813]  Elon Musk says they want a world government where they merge the machines and kill everybody.
[01:04:09.093 --> 01:04:09.734]  That's the plan.
[01:04:09.774 --> 01:04:14.737]  That's why this professor and all these other papers say we want in-game removed from the web.
[01:04:15.697 --> 01:04:18.199]  Why do they want in-game blueprint for global enslavement removed?
[01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:21.996]  That's their kryptonite.
[01:04:22.016 --> 01:04:22.496]  This is it.
[01:04:22.796 --> 01:04:23.936]  I mean, it's the timeline.
[01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:26.417]  They're operating under a collage of chaos, which is very effective.
[01:04:26.437 --> 01:04:28.538]  And by the way, you notice the film is a timeline.
[01:04:28.778 --> 01:04:29.798]  That's why they got so pissed.
[01:04:30.219 --> 01:04:32.900]  I later learned they wanted me to come to Oxford because of Endgame.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.801]  That was privately why they said, we have some people want to talk to you.
[01:04:35.841 --> 01:04:42.983]  But I later learned from a Hollywood person who those people were, they were going to try to co-op me because they were asking, how do you know the timeline?
[01:04:43.263 --> 01:04:44.344]  I could see the timeline.
[01:04:45.365 --> 01:04:50.979]  Exactly, and you know, it happens just in perfect timing when you speak about the 5G, when we know what technology is doing.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.242]  This is all planned.
[01:04:52.262 --> 01:04:54.628]  They need us disengaged in what InfoWars does.
[01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:58.542]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:06.348]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[01:05:06.909 --> 01:05:13.114]  With InfoWars Life Select Storable Food, you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.

[01:05:30.668 --> 01:05:35.192]  InfoWars Life Select storable food will help you eat comfortably in a time of need.

[01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:12.146]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:12.606 --> 01:06:18.089]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:18.229 --> 01:06:25.874]  I don't want to be in your prison planet hell.
[01:06:27.075 --> 01:06:30.437]  It ain't no mystery.
[01:06:31.798 --> 01:06:35.561]  Why I'm in misery.
[01:06:40.117 --> 01:06:42.138]  Yeah, they call us.
[01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:50.123]  Unholy living dead.
[01:06:50.663 --> 01:06:52.765]  Put us in their pretty pens.
[01:06:54.226 --> 01:06:54.766]  British Elm.
[01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:58.622]  Yep, Global Dungeons.
[01:06:58.642 --> 01:07:00.263]  I don't want to be in your New World Order hell.
[01:07:17.495 --> 01:07:26.280]  Generators kick on, it still cuts all the systems off, and then a bunch of other systems got cut off, so I apologize for everybody on that here, but we have mega-massive news breaking.
[01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:29.983]  We started the new hour, just, Zach, real fast, and then we'll go to Roger.
[01:07:30.663 --> 01:07:34.686]  Zach, just, just, just recapping, how would you quantify what we're currently under?
[01:07:35.046 --> 01:07:38.808]  We're under the Clinton globalist deep state Mueller coup against America.
[01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:39.789]  Is that an accurate statement?
[01:07:40.712 --> 01:07:46.637]  That's 100% it, and it goes even deeper than that with dug-in generational chain of commands there.
[01:07:47.257 --> 01:07:52.121]  And what Donald Trump is doing right now is attempting to launch the Second American Revolution, but it's not easy.
[01:07:52.221 --> 01:07:54.603]  All the personal stuff stateside is going on.
[01:07:54.983 --> 01:07:58.366]  Meanwhile, we have Chinese military shooting down U.S.
[01:07:58.406 --> 01:07:59.287]  airmen in Djibouti.
[01:07:59.587 --> 01:08:01.769]  I mean, we have peace on the Korean Peninsula.
[01:08:01.969 --> 01:08:03.390]  We have everything going on in the Middle East.
[01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.293]  This is a collage of chaos, and that's what they're operating under.
[01:08:06.533 --> 01:08:12.358]  They must keep us distracted, and the reason you're being attacked and the reason we're being attacked is because we're connecting the timeline.
[01:08:12.578 --> 01:08:14.940]  If we understand the timeline, we can realize the future.
[01:08:15.281 --> 01:08:15.721]  That's it.
[01:08:16.001 --> 01:08:16.362]  Period.
[01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:18.444]  That's what's going on, and we are in the fight.
[01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:21.366]  It is as serious as it's ever been in human history.
[01:08:21.526 --> 01:08:24.109]  Everything has reached the moment right now.
[01:08:24.389 --> 01:08:33.502]  And when we think about timeline, we are able to influence the timeline by becoming history's actors, and by actually being motivated individuals, as in all the Pentagon documents.
[01:08:33.722 --> 01:08:35.845]  And the Pentagon's been ordered to target those individuals.
[01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:40.913]  It's like Clapper said that time, and Brennan, oh we're not, no it was Hayden.
[01:08:42.259 --> 01:08:42.680]  I don't know.
[01:09:03.882 --> 01:09:04.963]  And that's all over newspapers.
[01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:07.445]  We must tell the children, no Alex Jones.
[01:09:07.785 --> 01:09:13.029]  I mean, this is such a quantum insanity, which it means they're going for complete broke, Zach.
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.590]  Absolutely.
[01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.613]  And what did the Tesla roaster that was launching their orbits say on the screen there?
[01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.114]  Don't panic.
[01:09:20.006 --> 01:09:20.527]  We are in it.
[01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:23.250]  We must breathe deep and focus right now.
[01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:24.172]  We are in it.
[01:09:24.212 --> 01:09:24.993]  This is destiny.
[01:09:25.533 --> 01:09:26.214]  It had to happen.
[01:09:26.234 --> 01:09:29.298]  I would prefer a different life right now, but we can't do that.
[01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:34.706]  Don't the globalists, I agree, don't the globalists realize though that even if they're able to take us out, that they're done?
[01:09:36.158 --> 01:09:37.079]  You've been saying it for years.
[01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:38.300]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[01:09:38.681 --> 01:09:40.843]  And the fact that we're doing what we're doing is incredible.
[01:09:41.124 --> 01:09:41.965]  I'm honored to be here.
[01:09:42.325 --> 01:09:45.368]  But we have to, we have got to compile the timeline in real time.
[01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:46.550]  We have got to give it to the people.
[01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:50.935]  We have to continue to double down and support our president and really get through him because he's under major attack right now.
[01:09:50.995 --> 01:09:53.738]  The timeline is critical because they're operating under the collage of chaos.
[01:09:53.758 --> 01:09:54.198]  That's what it is.
[01:09:54.218 --> 01:09:55.079]  That's a complete tactic.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.601]  Every single day something happens.
[01:09:56.921 --> 01:09:59.642]  While real-world things are happening, you can never focus on one thing.
[01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:00.622]  You have to keep the plate spinning.
[01:10:01.002 --> 01:10:02.043]  That's what they're hoping for.
[01:10:02.063 --> 01:10:03.303]  That is what they're hoping for.
[01:10:03.323 --> 01:10:04.383]  But this is the only chance we've got.
[01:10:04.403 --> 01:10:06.684]  We've got to double down and support Donald Trump here.
[01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:07.644]  All right, thank you.
[01:10:07.724 --> 01:10:08.805]  God bless you, Zach.
[01:10:09.425 --> 01:10:11.186]  I don't know if we have a Skype ready to pipe through.
[01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:15.067]  We're not streaming video yet up to the TV stations, are we?
[01:10:15.847 --> 01:10:18.068]  He's ready via Skype or he's ready via phone?
[01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:18.288]  Skype.
[01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:21.029]  All right, let's bring Roger in.
[01:10:21.049 --> 01:10:22.849]  But Roger, you're going to be all over the news today on the show.
[01:10:22.869 --> 01:10:24.270]  Are you going to really wear a 20-gallon
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.621]  Cowboy hat today?
[01:10:27.322 --> 01:10:30.145]  Well, today was supposed to be my day off, Alex.
[01:10:30.606 --> 01:10:32.889]  I was going to take my godson to the beach.
[01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:37.133]  But when I got the call this morning that you needed me, here I am.
[01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:42.960]  I'm wearing my Trigger the Libtards t-shirt, which as you know is available.
[01:10:43.801 --> 01:10:45.862]  Uh, at the Infowars.com store.
[01:10:45.902 --> 01:10:48.424]  This is about my favorite of all the t-shirts.
[01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:53.386]  Uh, but yeah, I'm gonna wear my cowboy hat because I'm not ashamed.
[01:10:53.566 --> 01:10:56.208]  I may be in Florida, but my heart's in Texas.
[01:10:56.328 --> 01:10:56.868]  Hey, we love you.
[01:10:56.888 --> 01:10:57.489]  I'm teasing you.
[01:10:57.609 --> 01:11:03.292]  You know, I knew that you were gonna take your grandson to the beach, what a cutie he is, and hang out with the wife and family.
[01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:10.032]  But how, and I know you're ignoring a lot of the mainstream media, but I mean, you're the top story right now in the country in this whole coup.
[01:11:11.293 --> 01:11:13.394]  I mean, I mean, this is unbelievable, Roger.
[01:11:13.454 --> 01:11:14.334]  Let's stand the cameras at him.
[01:11:14.614 --> 01:11:14.794]  Thanks.
[01:11:15.014 --> 01:11:16.075]  This is unbelievable.
[01:11:16.435 --> 01:11:19.517]  I mean, they are saying you're the main target now of all this crap.
[01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:23.759]  Federal judges for those who just joined us are coming out saying Mueller, quote, lied.
[01:11:24.139 --> 01:11:29.161]  That they're involved in a runaway operation of, quote, unfettered power in a coup?
[01:11:29.181 --> 01:11:31.322]  I mean, we have judges saying they're launching coups.
[01:11:31.362 --> 01:11:32.222]  That's Fox News.
[01:11:32.643 --> 01:11:34.143]  So this is damn serious, man.
[01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:35.444]  These people are crazy.
[01:11:35.464 --> 01:11:36.764]  The crimes they've committed, everything's going on.
[01:11:36.804 --> 01:11:38.285]  So thank you for giving us the exclusive.
[01:11:38.305 --> 01:11:42.087]  You're about to host for hours here, because I've got an emergency situation I've got to take care of.
[01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:50.070]  You're about to take over here, compadre, but just go ahead and just break down the magnitude of what we're facing.
[01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:59.718]  You know, Alex, it's really heartening that every once in a while there's a federal judge who actually is committed to his duty and the U.S.
[01:11:59.758 --> 01:12:02.620]  Constitution, who has some integrity.
[01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:08.324]  The judge in the District of Columbia, who is sitting on the Manafort case there,
[01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.686]  Is a stooge for the government.
[01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:14.008]  He will do anything the federal prosecutors ask him to.
[01:12:14.548 --> 01:12:18.750]  He will turn a blind eye to their willful violation of the U.S.
[01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:22.332]  Constitution and the civil liberties that are guaranteed there.
[01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:31.817]  Now, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, you have a courageous federal judge who's prepared to speak out and slap down Mueller.
[01:12:32.657 --> 01:12:34.099]  So when will they suicide him?
[01:12:34.639 --> 01:12:40.044]  When will he mysteriously die in a car crash or an airplane accident?
[01:12:40.885 --> 01:12:43.548]  I give enormous credit to the judge.
[01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:46.285]  I must say, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:46.385 --> 01:12:54.213]  There's nothing like the experience of waking up and finding out that you're the top story on the Drudge Report.
[01:12:55.053 --> 01:13:01.139]  I have huge respect and affection for Matt Drudge, but he did kind of screw up my breakfast.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.821]  The irony of this is,
[01:13:04.782 --> 01:13:25.009]  The story cited says that the focus of Mueller's, they say he's sharply focused on my relationship with former Manafort aide Rick Gates, a man I virtually had no meaningful, substantive interaction with through all of 2016.
[01:13:25.089 --> 01:13:31.591]  That probably means they've got him to roll, though, and he's going to make up that, you know, you had flying monkeys coming out your rear end.
[01:13:32.588 --> 01:13:34.949]  Well, you know, I did have to think about it.
[01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:44.675]  Since the article says that they are focusing on dinners, with an S, between Gates and I, I had to stop and think, have I ever had dinner with this guy?
[01:13:45.376 --> 01:13:46.397]  No, actually I did.
[01:13:46.997 --> 01:13:59.465]  I attended a dinner with several others, Mike Caputo, John Haggerty, guys who triumphed in the New York primary, swept the New York primary for Donald Trump.
[01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:07.870]  It was supposed to be a meeting with Paul Manafort who cancelled at the last minute because he had to do something else and send his deputy.
[01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:11.033]  The topic on the table wasn't Russian collusion.
[01:14:11.554 --> 01:14:16.239]  The topic was the makeup of the New York delegation to the Republican National Convention.
[01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.191]  There's no collusion here.
[01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:20.433]  Is dinner with this guy a crime?
[01:14:21.253 --> 01:14:26.337]  Then they want to know about my meetings with Matt with Gates at Trump Tower in 2016.
[01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:27.738]  Guess what, Alex?
[01:14:28.198 --> 01:14:29.319]  There were no meetings.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.780]  None whatsoever!
[01:14:31.798 --> 01:14:32.258]  Nada!
[01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:33.299]  Zero!
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.483]  So this is an extension of the witch hunt.
[01:14:38.123 --> 01:14:39.965]  It's an effort to smear me.
[01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.308]  It's an effort to drive me into bankruptcy.
[01:14:44.008 --> 01:14:46.430]  I don't like coming on InfoWars and having to beg.
[01:14:47.031 --> 01:14:56.699]  I don't love having to send out hundreds of thousands of emails and post on my personal Facebook page that I'm facing a financial crisis.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.241]  But Mueller and his leaked investigation
[01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:03.001]  Have ruined my livelihood!
[01:15:03.642 --> 01:15:06.306]  They've destroyed my ability to make a living!
[01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:07.669]  And Roger, let's be clear though.
[01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:13.177]  We're making history, and the Founding Fathers, a lot of them lost everything they had, but I know you're happy to go to the fight.
[01:15:14.199 --> 01:15:15.741]  People should buy your new book that's coming out.
[01:15:16.567 --> 01:15:18.368]  They should go donate at StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:20.270]  Now, you've only got three or four lawsuits.
[01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:21.150]  I've got, like, nine.
[01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:22.271]  And I absolutely agree.
[01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:23.231]  And you work for InfoWars.
[01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.352]  Well, we're all being targeted here.
[01:15:25.253 --> 01:15:28.215]  And I haven't even plugged in an hour and 15 minutes on air.
[01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:28.635]  So you're right.
[01:15:28.655 --> 01:15:31.037]  When we come back, let's plug StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:15:31.057 --> 01:15:32.378]  Let's tell folks that they can support you.
[01:15:32.878 --> 01:15:34.779]  And then let's talk about InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:35.019 --> 01:15:38.362]  T-shirts, books, films, incredible supplements, giant deals.
[01:15:38.782 --> 01:15:40.143]  I mean, we don't have George Soros.
[01:15:40.223 --> 01:15:41.163]  We have you folks.
[01:15:41.744 --> 01:15:44.646]  We don't have billionaires funding us, which isn't a bad thing, but that's what, you know.
[01:15:45.006 --> 01:15:48.228]  Folks like Glenn Beck and other people, uh, Shapiro have.
[01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:49.349]  We're funded by you!
[01:15:49.369 --> 01:15:53.672]  That just pisses me off when Shapiro's trying to, you know, get in our business and make sure we don't have gas and stuff.
[01:15:54.313 --> 01:16:00.937]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:03.419]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.884]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[01:16:10.284 --> 01:16:12.926]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:16:13.186 --> 01:16:16.208]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:22.493]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:16:23.133 --> 01:16:29.598]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:16:29.978 --> 01:16:35.882]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:39.945]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:16:40.445 --> 01:16:48.651]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:55.276]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:16:56.329 --> 01:17:00.753]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[01:17:01.373 --> 01:17:09.480]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.722]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[01:17:12.262 --> 01:17:19.168]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[01:17:19.248 --> 01:17:22.251]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[01:17:22.831 --> 01:17:23.732]  It's not absorbable.
[01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:24.673]  It's toxic.
[01:17:25.353 --> 01:17:31.739]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.465]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[01:17:37.605 --> 01:17:40.127]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[01:17:40.848 --> 01:17:48.315]  We discovered that oil companies and gas-driven companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[01:17:48.335 --> 01:17:49.236]  They used to make drugs.
[01:17:49.296 --> 01:17:53.400]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:58.485]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[01:17:59.085 --> 01:18:02.668]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[01:18:02.948 --> 01:18:06.852]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[01:18:07.412 --> 01:18:10.154]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[01:18:10.194 --> 01:18:11.335]  We have a good supply right now.
[01:18:11.736 --> 01:18:13.097]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[01:18:13.537 --> 01:18:15.839]  But this may be the clincher.
[01:18:15.879 --> 01:18:19.062]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[01:18:19.502 --> 01:18:22.903]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[01:18:23.363 --> 01:18:26.425]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue.
[01:18:26.465 --> 01:18:27.205]  And we do get more.
[01:18:27.545 --> 01:18:34.908]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[01:18:35.228 --> 01:18:38.649]  Survival Shield X2 at mfulworthstore.com and mfulworthslife.com.
[01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:41.991]  And you've got to experience what having the good halogen in your body does.
[01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:45.212]  Most folks in about three weeks go through a detoxification process.
[01:18:45.912 --> 01:18:47.833]  But what it does is for stamina, libido,
[01:18:48.733 --> 01:18:50.395]  Focus energy is really amazing.
[01:18:50.555 --> 01:18:57.561]  And if you don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[01:18:57.881 --> 01:19:00.003]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[01:19:00.364 --> 01:19:01.625]  It's available exclusively.
[01:19:01.885 --> 01:19:05.688]  Survival Shield X2 at m4warslife.com and m4warsstore.com.
[01:19:05.748 --> 01:19:07.169]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[01:19:08.266 --> 01:19:09.447]  That we can work this out.
[01:19:27.581 --> 01:19:30.362]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[01:19:30.702 --> 01:19:39.023]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[01:19:39.584 --> 01:19:43.904]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:50.906]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:58.206 --> 01:20:02.388]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.793 --> 01:20:22.055]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.522 --> 01:20:38.028]  You better turn me loose!
[01:20:39.048 --> 01:20:40.429]  You better set me free!
[01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:46.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, I admire Kanye West for his courage standing with Trump and the Reboot of America.
[01:20:46.313 --> 01:20:47.633]  I admire Roger Stone.
[01:20:47.653 --> 01:20:48.494]  I admire all of you.
[01:20:48.514 --> 01:20:49.394]  I admire this crew.
[01:20:49.815 --> 01:20:51.716]  I admire my family for standing strong with us.
[01:20:52.416 --> 01:20:55.118]  And I've done an hour and 20 minutes of transmission and now it's time to plug.
[01:20:56.403 --> 01:20:59.149]  We need everybody to give us the support.
[01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:06.505]  If you support America, if you stand against Mueller and the whole Clinton crime syndicate coup, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:21:08.169 --> 01:21:08.909]  Are the main sites.
[01:21:08.969 --> 01:21:10.310]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main site.
[01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:16.091]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the award-winning supplements where we go out and say, what is the best in the industry, the most award-winning?
[01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:20.512]  Let's either private label that and then lower prices, 20-30% is our formula.
[01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:27.434]  And then, sometimes even more, and then how can we take the best-selling formulas and make them even stronger?
[01:21:28.015 --> 01:21:33.276]  Like we're coming out soon with alpha products that are going to be unbelievable.
[01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:37.209]  So just get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:49.976]  We're going to have Brain Force that's in a single serving package that's next level that is going to be three times the serving of the leading competitor, but the competitor has the best stuff.
[01:21:50.797 --> 01:21:51.777]  And it's going to be the same price.
[01:21:53.798 --> 01:21:55.459]  So that's what we do.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:00.122]  Alpha Power is our newest stamina energy libido product.
[01:22:00.502 --> 01:22:01.082]  It's powdered.
[01:22:01.703 --> 01:22:03.444]  It's organic, but it's not cold press like.
[01:22:04.355 --> 01:22:04.755]  Supermill.
[01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:05.735]  Supermill's excellent.
[01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:14.758]  There's not as much of the compounds per capita, but it's stronger because it's cold-pressed and has whatever that natural function is with the other oils it's with.
[01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:19.880]  Like anybody will tell you, you know, marijuana, the bud, is different than an extract of it.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.000]  So that's not what I'm saying, it's marijuana, but you understand what I'm saying?
[01:22:23.621 --> 01:22:26.001]  So it's the real essence of cold-pressed, truly cold-pressed.
[01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:28.182]  It takes like five times more of the herbs to make it.
[01:22:29.605 --> 01:22:34.130]  So it's stronger in its concentrate and live, like wine, but it's not as strong.
[01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:39.856]  Alpha Power is just, I said, I want whatever's the known, strongest, best, seen as safe, but blow you away.
[01:22:39.876 --> 01:22:43.680]  And we went to four different major groups and it all came together.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.762]  They said, this is it.
[01:22:45.462 --> 01:22:45.943]  This is it.
[01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:47.604]  Other people sell it for like $100.
[01:22:47.664 --> 01:22:49.805]  When we sell it for $50, it's a great deal.
[01:22:50.126 --> 01:22:54.969]  It's half off right now, like what, $25 or something, when you get it with Super Bill Vitality.
[01:22:54.989 --> 01:22:56.390]  But be careful with this stuff.
[01:22:57.131 --> 01:22:58.031]  X2 is selling out.
[01:22:58.131 --> 01:23:03.075]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:03.115 --> 01:23:05.397]  But people ask, how am I so excited?
[01:23:07.058 --> 01:23:07.758]  My wife gets it.
[01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:10.821]  She's like, man, they're on TV saying that you need to be shut off the air.
[01:23:11.181 --> 01:23:12.322]  They're on air saying you're a criminal.
[01:23:14.284 --> 01:23:17.046]  George Soros group suing you, Hillary suing you, all this.
[01:23:17.246 --> 01:23:18.987]  Why do you get so energized by it?
[01:23:19.567 --> 01:23:20.888]  Because these are the bad guys.
[01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:30.515]  So like, if I was a World War II soldier, and I was flying bombing missions over Germany, and they picked me to be like Captain America on the German side and called me, you know...
[01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:32.354]  You know, G.I.
[01:23:32.514 --> 01:23:33.574]  Dumbass or something.
[01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.555]  I wouldn't think I was a dumbass.
[01:23:35.635 --> 01:23:36.816]  I wouldn't feel bad about myself.
[01:23:36.856 --> 01:23:41.059]  If I was chosen to be the Nazi kicking boy, I'd feel pretty damn good.
[01:23:41.079 --> 01:23:42.760]  Because they're the Nazis.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:43.940]  So I don't care what they say.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.921]  I don't care what they do.
[01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.562]  I committed to life for this.
[01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.523]  And I'm not going to stop.
[01:23:48.663 --> 01:23:50.624]  And quite frankly, I'm alive, baby.
[01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:53.626]  It's not about being macho.
[01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:56.068]  It's not about being, oh, I'm so tough, I'll do daredevil stuff.
[01:23:56.208 --> 01:23:57.829]  I don't jump out of airplanes for fun.
[01:23:59.212 --> 01:24:00.793]  You know, when I was younger, I've done things like that.
[01:24:01.333 --> 01:24:02.614]  I don't do the thrill-seeking.
[01:24:02.634 --> 01:24:04.875]  I don't drive my car 170 miles an hour anymore.
[01:24:04.895 --> 01:24:05.755]  Not saying I ever did.
[01:24:06.976 --> 01:24:09.437]  Because I don't take those undue risks for nothing.
[01:24:09.497 --> 01:24:11.478]  I take them for my children and the future.
[01:24:12.179 --> 01:24:12.779]  And everything.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.781]  And they go, well, they can come after your kids.
[01:24:15.901 --> 01:24:18.242]  They're coming after everybody with the 5G, the GMO.
[01:24:18.562 --> 01:24:20.583]  The only way out of this is standing up and speaking out.
[01:24:20.863 --> 01:24:23.825]  And they want to take an example of us and say, look how we destroy Alex Jones.
[01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.690]  They're out of bullets.
[01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:29.192]  They've said all that same crap about Trump, and people are breaking their conditioning there.
[01:24:29.492 --> 01:24:34.554]  It's happening with us, but it's not about a popularity contest at the end of the day for me.
[01:24:34.915 --> 01:24:35.775]  It's about victory.
[01:24:36.455 --> 01:24:38.136]  And these globalists are so bad, it's got to be done.
[01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.517]  There's a full-scale coup going on.
[01:24:40.017 --> 01:24:41.317]  So thank you for your financial support.
[01:24:41.858 --> 01:24:43.719]  Take advantage of those big sales over the weekend.
[01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.200]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.481]  DNA Force is now back in stock after almost six months of being sold out.
[01:24:49.801 --> 01:24:50.762]  It's DNA Force Plus.
[01:24:50.822 --> 01:24:51.482]  Stronger?
[01:24:52.763 --> 01:24:53.363]  Way stronger.
[01:24:54.619 --> 01:24:58.440]  Well, there's like 30% more of the PQQ, the CoQ10, all of it.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.020]  And we did a year-long contract.
[01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:03.681]  I'm betting if I sell it for less, we'll sell a lot more.
[01:25:03.741 --> 01:25:10.383]  So I did a year contract, bought a lot more, lower in the price, and people are buying the same amount as when it was $150.
[01:25:10.663 --> 01:25:11.743]  Okay, whatever, fine.
[01:25:12.123 --> 01:25:14.844]  I thought you'd want something better at a lower price, but whatever.
[01:25:14.864 --> 01:25:16.064]  It's selling the same thing it ever did.
[01:25:17.504 --> 01:25:20.885]  It's stronger, it works great, and it's less price.
[01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:25.072]  Roger, you take over and do a few minutes plugging for yourself here and then come back.
[01:25:25.112 --> 01:25:27.093]  We've got our crew at the NRA show in Dallas.
[01:25:27.113 --> 01:25:28.094]  They're going to be piping in.
[01:25:28.114 --> 01:25:29.675]  Your co-host Owens Froyer for the war room.
[01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:32.336]  You've got so much to break down and run over here.
[01:25:32.356 --> 01:25:33.397]  You're going to take over, my friend.
[01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:36.599]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:36.619 --> 01:25:39.201]  We are back up on the live streams right now, my friend.
[01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:41.182]  So thanks to all the TV and radio affiliates.
[01:25:41.502 --> 01:25:46.085]  Roger Stone, the number one target of the Mueller and the globalist deep state coup against America.
[01:25:46.425 --> 01:25:50.510]  You are now the number one target, even eclipsing Trump, and so I'm a little bit jealous.
[01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.850]  Go ahead.
[01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:52.512]  Your John Hancock's now bigger than mine.
[01:25:53.613 --> 01:25:54.775]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:59.200]  Alex, I do want to say something that you alluded to.
[01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:03.504]  The best thing about the InfoWars products is when you stack them.
[01:26:04.381 --> 01:26:18.175]  I find, for example, combining the Red Pill with Brain Force Plus, a body-mind combination, really gives you peak performance, peak energy, peak acuity, peak mental energy and clarity.
[01:26:19.136 --> 01:26:24.321]  And I've compared these products with, you know, the competitors whose names we don't want to mention.
[01:26:24.761 --> 01:26:25.282]  Whole Foods.
[01:26:27.306 --> 01:26:35.993]  Our supplements are better, the quality of the ingredients are higher, the volume is more, the prices are lower.
[01:26:36.934 --> 01:26:41.638]  The MindBody Challenge Pack is my all-time favorite so far.
[01:26:42.319 --> 01:26:52.008]  Now, I also though, I have tried the Alpha Power Stacked with Super Male Vitality, known around the office as the Michael Zimmerman Combination.
[01:26:52.862 --> 01:26:54.443]  This one is extraordinary.
[01:26:54.543 --> 01:27:03.629]  I hate this word, but the synergy between these products is extraordinary because they have two completely different, essentially, delivery systems.
[01:27:04.489 --> 01:27:11.734]  You cannot find supplements of this quality at this price where you're also supporting the fight for a free press.
[01:27:12.774 --> 01:27:20.079]  And you're financing the defense in the multiple lawsuits that InfoWars is facing
[01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:41.316]  Which are baseless, bogus, meritless, frivolous, if you will, designed to smear us, designed to shut us down, designed to give the globalists and the tech left the phony rationale to take us off YouTube, take us off Facebook, silence us.
[01:27:41.916 --> 01:27:44.557]  We scare the crap out of the globalists.
[01:27:44.657 --> 01:27:44.997]  Why?
[01:27:45.717 --> 01:27:49.378]  Because when you're not financed by a big corporate sponsor,
[01:27:50.635 --> 01:27:52.056]  Our information is unfettered.
[01:27:52.977 --> 01:27:58.981]  No one says to Alex Jones, you can't cover that, you can't say that, you can't expose that.
[01:27:59.961 --> 01:28:03.544]  We here at InfoWars, we go where the facts lead us.
[01:28:04.793 --> 01:28:28.262]  And if you're not in the market for one of our cutting-edge nutraceuticals, you're not interested in a terrific book, for example, the iconic Making of the President 2016 by the New York Times best-selling author Roger Stone, well then consider going to the Infowars site and just making a generous contribution.
[01:28:28.282 --> 01:28:28.262]  $25, $50, $100.
[01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:33.764]  Anything you give helps fuel the fight for freedom.
[01:28:54.349 --> 01:29:02.053]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:29:02.893 --> 01:29:06.955]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:29:07.455 --> 01:29:09.796]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:29:10.596 --> 01:29:13.718]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:29:15.239 --> 01:29:27.366]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:29:28.066 --> 01:29:43.115]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:29:44.116 --> 01:29:47.822]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for your family.
[01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.106]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:52.370]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:29:56.774 --> 01:30:03.842]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their hammerlock, their complete monopoly on political discourse in this country.
[01:30:04.122 --> 01:30:15.696]  Donald Trump's election, in fact the entire sea change in American politics, was only made possible through a robust and vibrant alternative media allowed through an unfettered internet.
[01:30:15.996 --> 01:30:35.867]  This is not only about the 2016 and 2020 elections, it's about the slow motion coup that's going on in this country, where a fabricated dossier can be used to justify legally the illegal surveillance, the unconstitutional surveillance on the Republican candidate for President of the United States.
[01:30:36.127 --> 01:30:44.309]  But you see, those who are the perps in that crime don't want any discussion of that crime in the mainstream or the alternative media.
[01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:52.152]  And that is why they seek, through a very, I think, duplicitous strategy of lawfare,
[01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:55.595]  And censorship to shut us down.
[01:30:55.875 --> 01:31:07.568]  The key to this, of course, is the lawsuits, and I'm facing one from an Obama-blessed front call project, Democracy, who are suing me and Donald Trump.
[01:31:07.868 --> 01:31:12.192]  The allegation being that we worked with the Russians to hack
[01:31:13.013 --> 01:31:16.756]  Uh, the Democratic National Committee and give that material to WikiLeaks.
[01:31:16.916 --> 01:31:22.861]  That is as unprovable in a court of law as it will be unprovable in the court of public opinion.
[01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:24.702]  Because it's a fairy tale.
[01:31:25.203 --> 01:31:26.023]  A falsehood.
[01:31:26.524 --> 01:31:27.264]  A lie.
[01:31:27.745 --> 01:31:28.545]  A canard.
[01:31:28.966 --> 01:31:31.247]  A steaming plate of, well, you know.
[01:31:32.328 --> 01:31:51.696]  The point here, of course, is that if they can silence us, if they can take us off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, it becomes much easier to drive their false narrative about the 2016 election, their false narrative about the unconstitutional activities going on today,
[01:31:52.176 --> 01:32:05.491]  Whether it is raiding Donald Trump's lawyer's office or whether it is the illegal surveillance of the Republican candidate for president under FISA warrants that were fabricated in their rationale, fabricated in their purpose.
[01:32:05.911 --> 01:32:08.614]  And then, of course, there's the Second Amendment.
[01:32:09.295 --> 01:32:13.638]  Silence us before you attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights.
[01:32:14.198 --> 01:32:14.979]  This is a struggle.
[01:32:15.179 --> 01:32:17.841]  This is the single most important struggle.
[01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:18.581]  Why?
[01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:27.146]  Because without our voice, all other issues, trade, immigration, the economy, we are at an enormous disadvantage.
[01:32:27.587 --> 01:32:30.809]  The real story here is that the American left
[01:32:31.289 --> 01:32:33.870]  No longer is interested in dialogue or debate.
[01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:35.870]  They can't win a debate.
[01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:37.590]  They don't want a debate.
[01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:39.731]  They don't want a discussion of issues.
[01:32:40.071 --> 01:32:46.772]  Their answer when we raise facts and arguments is silence them, censor them, close them down.
[01:32:47.212 --> 01:32:49.853]  That's why you know they have lost.
[01:32:50.353 --> 01:32:50.753]  Thank you.
[01:32:57.434 --> 01:33:00.095]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.535 --> 01:33:12.618]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.658 --> 01:33:14.241]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:14.661 --> 01:33:15.502]  Or you're mine.
[01:33:15.542 --> 01:33:16.864]  Welcome back!
[01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:27.663]  You're on the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars, and I'm pinch-hitting as your host today.
[01:33:28.263 --> 01:33:29.503]  I'm Roger Stone.
[01:33:30.324 --> 01:33:41.087]  An extraordinary day in which a federal judge finally puts down Robert Mueller and strips bare the real agenda of the special counsel.
[01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:45.990]  He's not interested in the alleged crimes of Paul Manafort.
[01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:53.955]  He's interested in anything he can do to take down Donald Trump, through an impeachment or otherwise.
[01:33:54.475 --> 01:34:04.522]  He's interested in undoing the results of the last free election this country may ever have if the globalists get their way.
[01:34:05.635 --> 01:34:23.203]  See, I don't think people understand that the Trilateral Commission and the neocon two-party duopoly that have dominated American politics and government essentially for the last 30 years had everything neatly arranged.
[01:34:24.172 --> 01:34:29.975]  The presidential election was going to be Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.
[01:34:30.715 --> 01:34:47.744]  Two families that I revealed in my books, the Clinton's War on Women and the Bush crime family, work closely together in a criminal syndicate to enrich themselves.
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:53.141]  You see, the globalist cabal really has no ideology.
[01:34:53.681 --> 01:34:55.541]  They're not really communists.
[01:34:56.301 --> 01:35:04.543]  They're just interested in control, power, and wealth for themselves and their cronies.
[01:35:05.363 --> 01:35:08.704]  They're just interested in erasing our borders.
[01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:13.845]  Not just ours, but the borders of every nation in the world.
[01:35:14.665 --> 01:35:26.832]  They want one world government with no constitutional guarantees of civil liberties or free expression or any modicum of personal freedom.
[01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.533]  They want controlled economies.
[01:35:29.914 --> 01:35:32.615]  They want controlled personal behavior.
[01:35:33.296 --> 01:35:36.998]  They want to strip us of our national identity.
[01:35:37.418 --> 01:35:42.401]  They want to strip us of our national sovereignty and above all,
[01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:52.366]  They want to lord over us a small handful of billionaire bankers stripping away our very freedoms.
[01:35:53.166 --> 01:35:56.428]  And along comes a reality TV star.
[01:35:57.458 --> 01:36:00.360]  A real estate developer from New York City.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:06.004]  Well, let's face it, we all know Donald Trump's not really going to run.
[01:36:06.024 --> 01:36:09.426]  This is a publicity stunt, they told us.
[01:36:10.006 --> 01:36:14.509]  It's just Trump addicted to reading his name in the newspaper.
[01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:21.274]  And then when he got in the race, they said, well, he's not going to have any money.
[01:36:21.674 --> 01:36:24.576]  He won't put any of his own money in.
[01:36:25.397 --> 01:36:26.758]  But then he put in 10 million.
[01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:31.272]  Well then they said, this guy can't win.
[01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:33.253]  You've seen all the polls.
[01:36:33.894 --> 01:36:37.056]  Hillary Clinton's got this thing in the bag.
[01:36:38.496 --> 01:36:47.262]  They were so confident that their backup plan, their insurance policy, just in case something went wrong,
[01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:56.491]  ...was memorialized in government texts and emails, on government servers, on government cell phones.
[01:36:57.352 --> 01:37:00.072]  No reason to worry about those ever becoming public.
[01:37:00.652 --> 01:37:17.515]  Hillary will be able to run a cover-up, just like Obama was unconcerned about his unfettered violation of the Constitution when he approved the surveillance of the Republican candidate for President.
[01:37:18.743 --> 01:37:21.265]  Stop and think about that for a moment.
[01:37:22.326 --> 01:37:28.212]  Watergate, we were told, was the greatest constitutional crisis in our history.
[01:37:29.873 --> 01:37:42.925]  Six men, partisans for Richard Nixon, broke into the Watergate and attempted to place bugs, which never actually worked, and they were caught.
[01:37:43.732 --> 01:37:51.676]  They were caught because the CIA learned about the rogue operation and infiltrated it.
[01:37:52.497 --> 01:38:03.543]  We now know that at least three of the Watergate burglars were still actively on the payroll of the CIA and were reporting to their case officers.
[01:38:04.583 --> 01:38:07.965]  Nixon's crime ended the war in Vietnam.
[01:38:08.745 --> 01:38:11.067]  He opened the door to China.
[01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:16.694]  He reached a strategic arms limitation with the Soviets!
[01:38:17.935 --> 01:38:20.778]  He desegregated the public schools!
[01:38:21.718 --> 01:38:22.399]  My God!
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.701]  The man's a peacemaker!
[01:38:25.181 --> 01:38:26.663]  We've got to get rid of him!
[01:38:27.864 --> 01:38:28.524]  And they did.
[01:38:30.066 --> 01:38:37.112]  As I said in the earlier segment, you can look at the coup d'etat that went down in America in 1963.
[01:38:39.867 --> 01:38:59.594]  When Lyndon Baines Johnson working with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, the organized crime, and big Texas oil to snuff out the life and the presidency of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
[01:39:00.831 --> 01:39:21.500]  I interviewed a Dallas Times Herald reporter who said that the FBI came to their newsroom, ripped her copy out of the typewriter, and rewrote it to reflect that Lee Harvey Oswald, allegedly a communist, acted alone.
[01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:31.060]  Then, of course, in 1974, we had the second American coup, the takedown of President Richard M. Nixon.
[01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:35.206]  The Washington Post, the New York Times, led the way.
[01:39:36.397 --> 01:39:45.480]  They didn't tell us that the Pentagon had the President of the United States under surveillance early in his presidency.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:58.784]  They didn't tell us that the Central Intelligence Agency had infiltrated the Watergate burglar team to ensure that the break-in would be botched and the men would be arrested.
[01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:20.631]  They didn't tell us that the Watergate Special Prosecutor was having illegal expartide conversations with Federal Judge John Sirica to ensure that the Watergate burglars couldn't get a fair trial and any possibility of appeal had been cooked in advance.
[01:40:22.212 --> 01:40:23.752]  What's the difference between 1963, 1974, and today?
[01:40:29.226 --> 01:40:31.167]  Here's the single most important thing.
[01:40:32.488 --> 01:40:33.528]  Info Wars.
[01:40:34.449 --> 01:40:35.969]  And THE Info War.
[01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:39.251]  The rise of the Internet.
[01:40:40.072 --> 01:40:52.198]  The fact that ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, yes, some on Fox, they've lost their monopoly on political discourse.
[01:40:53.346 --> 01:41:07.535]  In 1963, there was no media outlet in the country who had any opinion other than the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone, not-communist who acted alone to kill JFK.
[01:41:09.082 --> 01:41:20.989]  In 1974, there was no newspaper, no media outlet in the country that would report about the CIA's infiltration of the Watergate break-in.
[01:41:21.469 --> 01:41:36.919]  And the fact that Judge John Sirica and Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski, like Archibald Cox before him, should have been disbarred for their illegal gaming of the legal system against Richard Dixon.
[01:41:37.779 --> 01:41:54.752]  Today, however, in the attempted coup to take down Donald Trump and restore the Trilateral Commission and globalist control of our government, they are thwarted by a robust, vibrant alternative media.
[01:41:55.272 --> 01:41:59.315]  And yes, InfoWars is the flagship.
[01:41:59.916 --> 01:42:03.419]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:42:04.448 --> 01:42:17.735]  That's why it nauseates me when I hear punks like Ben Shapiro, a globalist who thought the Iraq War was peachy teen, telling others, don't appear on InfoWars.
[01:42:18.195 --> 01:42:19.456]  They're dangerous.
[01:42:19.536 --> 01:42:21.277]  Well, we are dangerous.
[01:42:22.017 --> 01:42:26.840]  We're dangerous to the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.482]  We're dangerous to their coup d'etat plan.
[01:42:31.102 --> 01:42:35.505]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll be right back.

[01:45:55.928 --> 01:45:56.228]  Go ahead.
[01:45:56.678 --> 01:45:58.740]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.782]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:03.723]  It just gets old, man.
[01:46:04.043 --> 01:46:05.765]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:46:06.465 --> 01:46:08.547]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:46:08.787 --> 01:46:12.790]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:15.292]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:46:16.112 --> 01:46:18.414]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:46:18.434 --> 01:46:19.895]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:46:20.155 --> 01:46:21.036]  Us being shut down?
[01:46:21.276 --> 01:46:22.317]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:46:22.737 --> 01:46:23.777]  You know what, Alex?
[01:46:23.817 --> 01:46:24.878]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:46:24.898 --> 01:46:25.718]  Hey, Frank!
[01:46:26.018 --> 01:46:31.379]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:35.960]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:39.061]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:39.701]  You understand?
[01:46:39.801 --> 01:46:41.061]  I need your help, Frank!

[01:46:51.148 --> 01:46:53.050]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:46:58.354 --> 01:47:00.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:14.311 --> 01:47:17.157]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[01:47:17.538 --> 01:47:20.284]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.049 --> 01:47:27.772]  Breaking news here on InfoWars.
[01:47:28.913 --> 01:47:46.071]  In the Miami Congressional District, challenger Soraya Fass has qualified for the Republican primary against leading never-Trumper, Country Club Republican, Liver...uh, Lily...uh, pardon me.
[01:47:47.463 --> 01:47:52.345]  Country Club Republican and certified Trump hater, Carlos Curbelo.
[01:47:52.985 --> 01:47:55.086]  This will be a barn burner face.
[01:47:55.907 --> 01:47:59.248]  Curbelo is a disgrace to the Republican Party.
[01:47:59.708 --> 01:48:05.371]  He is a disgrace to government, usually lining his pockets as a lobbyist.
[01:48:05.771 --> 01:48:13.294]  He has made his unfettered hatred of Donald Trump and our reform agenda his calling card.
[01:48:13.775 --> 01:48:14.815]  This cock has
[01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:15.916]  Has to go down.
[01:48:16.376 --> 01:48:21.438]  Congratulations to Soraya Fass for qualifying for the primary.
[01:48:22.058 --> 01:48:26.641]  She considered looking at the daunting, overwhelming odds dropping out.
[01:48:27.241 --> 01:48:32.684]  She told me she prayed to our Lord Jesus and he showed her the way.
[01:48:33.544 --> 01:48:37.649]  With Jesus Christ, folks, nothing is impossible.
[01:48:38.169 --> 01:48:38.570]  Nothing.
[01:48:39.151 --> 01:48:41.694]  Congratulations, Soraya Fass.
[01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:45.678]  Also, some breaking news here.
[01:48:45.698 --> 01:48:49.022]  I can reveal, for the first time,
[01:48:50.183 --> 01:48:53.047]  That former New York U.S.
[01:48:53.167 --> 01:49:02.537]  attorney, attorney for the Southern District, Preet Bharara, lunched with federal judge Kimba Woods only 10 days ago.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:13.864]  Because Bahara is a paid consultant to the Mueller inquiry, this lunch is improper.
[01:49:14.664 --> 01:49:33.832]  There will be bar complaints against both Bahara and Judge Woods, but the appropriate course of action would be for Senator Chuck Grassley to bring Judge Woods into an open hearing and ask her what she thinks she's doing.
[01:49:35.265 --> 01:49:53.333]  Is it coincidental that after Bahara, a man who has been indisputably caught illegally leaking grand jury testimony to the media by a federal judge, cooking a case with Judge Woods?
[01:49:53.893 --> 01:50:03.257]  Is it coincidental that Woods would subsequently deny all of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's motions before her court?
[01:50:04.232 --> 01:50:06.334]  You know Kimbo Wood, don't you?
[01:50:06.995 --> 01:50:13.922]  She's the one who had a particularly close personal relationship with Bill Clinton.
[01:50:14.523 --> 01:50:18.147]  In fact, Bill Clinton tried to appoint her U.S.
[01:50:18.207 --> 01:50:26.515]  Attorney General until we learned that she was evading the law by illegally paying a domestic.
[01:50:27.316 --> 01:50:29.917]  No, Kimba, we've got your number.
[01:50:30.277 --> 01:50:41.082]  No matter how this goes down, you will face disciplinary charges before the bar and, before I'm finished, impeachment before the U.S.
[01:50:41.322 --> 01:50:41.723]  Senate.
[01:50:42.663 --> 01:50:45.624]  Zack said it in the first segment.
[01:50:46.485 --> 01:50:47.845]  This is a war.
[01:50:48.826 --> 01:50:52.267]  The coup d'etat is on now.
[01:50:53.508 --> 01:50:55.729]  The coup d'etat is afoot.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.201]  They want to rumble.
[01:50:59.281 --> 01:51:05.124]  But the only thing they must do to succeed is to shut InfoWars down.
[01:51:05.944 --> 01:51:08.105]  To take away our guns.
[01:51:08.706 --> 01:51:11.787]  To strip us of our Second Amendment rights.
[01:51:12.788 --> 01:51:19.171]  With no firearms and no voices, only then can they succeed.
[01:51:19.891 --> 01:51:26.134]  That's why they are so maniacal about repealing the Second Amendment.
[01:51:27.406 --> 01:51:37.928]  It was funny to watch an undistinguished judge, John Paul Stevens, a stain on the history of the Supreme Court.
[01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:52.352]  Appointed to the court by the single dumbest president in American history, Gerald Ford, a man who literally could not chew gum and walk at the same time.
[01:51:53.112 --> 01:52:01.559]  A president whose IQ, if it were one point lower, you would have to water and classify him as a plant.
[01:52:02.654 --> 01:52:07.098]  And Stevens said that it was time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:52:07.999 --> 01:52:10.441]  Judge, I know you're dumb, but try to listen carefully.
[01:52:11.082 --> 01:52:18.709]  That requires a majority vote of both houses of Congress and ratification by a majority of the states.
[01:52:19.773 --> 01:52:22.757]  Not happening, libtard!
[01:52:23.477 --> 01:52:32.107]  Go back to your ivory tower and the ignominious disgrace that you bear as the single dumbest member of the U.S.
[01:52:32.147 --> 01:52:34.370]  Supreme Court in history.
[01:52:35.438 --> 01:52:52.736]  Tonight, I have the privilege of joining my friend Tucker Carlson on his show, on Fox, to discuss this incredible CNBC fake news story by Brian Fake News Schwartz.
[01:52:53.297 --> 01:53:04.681]  That says that I am now sharply the focus of the Mueller investigation due to my close relationship with former Manafort aide Rick Gates.
[01:53:05.301 --> 01:53:08.762]  A relationship that literally almost doesn't exist.
[01:53:09.302 --> 01:53:14.584]  He wants to probe the meetings between Gates and I. Except for there weren't any.
[01:53:15.204 --> 01:53:18.425]  He wants to probe our dinners with an S.
[01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:27.187]  I attended one dinner with him to discuss the makeup of the New York delegation to the Republican National Convention.
[01:53:27.927 --> 01:53:30.508]  Can you say fake news?
[01:53:31.448 --> 01:53:33.889]  This is an extraordinary smear.
[01:53:34.509 --> 01:53:38.170]  Now my friend Matt Drudge put it at the top of his story.
[01:53:38.970 --> 01:53:43.671]  Even Anderson Cooper has asked me to come on tonight and that may happen too.
[01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:50.116]  Because I will avail myself of any forum to expose what's going on here.
[01:53:51.298 --> 01:53:52.339]  It's a coup, folks.
[01:53:53.159 --> 01:54:02.629]  An unconstitutional, illegal act to try to reverse the results of the last presidential election.
[01:54:03.632 --> 01:54:10.037]  The globalists, the trilateralists, the neocons took it so hard in the keister.
[01:54:10.618 --> 01:54:24.430]  They are so bent out of the shape about this brash upstart billionaire who actually believes in American exceptionalism, who actually believes that we can have a stronger, more vibrant economy.
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.163]  Three percent economic growth under Donald Trump.
[01:54:29.823 --> 01:54:35.628]  The best Barack Obama could do was an average over eight years of a point and a half.
[01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:42.233]  Ten percent unemployment under Barry, pardon me, Barack Obama.
[01:54:43.406 --> 01:54:47.169]  3% unemployment under President Donald Trump.
[01:54:47.829 --> 01:54:57.215]  Now you see why they are so hysterical in their efforts to undo the will of the American people in the last election.
[01:54:58.136 --> 01:55:08.923]  And why it is essential that we do not let them remove the single most important obstacle to this coup d'etat.
[01:55:10.124 --> 01:55:11.705]  It's Infowars, folks.
[01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:17.963]  It's a vibrant, robust, alternative media outlet called the Internet.
[01:55:18.863 --> 01:55:20.144]  It's the Daily Caller.
[01:55:20.684 --> 01:55:21.605]  It's Breitbart.
[01:55:22.025 --> 01:55:23.306]  It's Gateway Pundit.
[01:55:23.787 --> 01:55:24.867]  It's Town Hall.
[01:55:25.448 --> 01:55:26.328]  It's all of them.
[01:55:27.309 --> 01:55:39.037]  I only wish our conservative, liberty-oriented brethren would recognize that if it's Alex Jones today, it will be them tomorrow.
[01:55:40.842 --> 01:55:43.604]  I love Sean Hannity and what he does on the air.
[01:55:44.064 --> 01:55:47.947]  I love the way he has exposed the deep state.
[01:55:48.547 --> 01:55:54.871]  I love the way he has shined the spotlight on the weasel Rod Rosenstein.
[01:55:55.452 --> 01:56:03.337]  A man we will hound, we will pursue, we will bring to justice, no matter how this breaks down.
[01:56:04.611 --> 01:56:13.617]  Sean needs to wake up and realize that if they censor Alex Jones and InfoWars today, it'll be Sean Hannity tomorrow.
[01:56:15.378 --> 01:56:16.179]  Laura Ingraham.
[01:56:16.819 --> 01:56:17.319]  I love her.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:18.720]  She's fearless.
[01:56:19.641 --> 01:56:26.686]  Laura needs to understand, if they gag Alex Jones today, it'll be Laura Ingraham tomorrow.
[01:56:27.668 --> 01:56:36.371]  And yes, my good friend Tucker Carlson, who I'm honored to say wrote the introduction of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[01:56:37.272 --> 01:56:40.193]  Yes, Tucker, they will silence you too.
[01:56:40.333 --> 01:56:40.633]  Why?
[01:56:41.113 --> 01:56:53.878]  Because you are so effective in your advocacy of freedom and by your fearless exposure of the globalist plan to overturn the last presidential election.
[01:56:55.086 --> 01:57:04.139]  Yesterday, I had an extraordinary experience in preparing for the launch of my next book, which is Stone's Rules.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.005]  This is essentially, let me try to get it, there we go.
[01:57:08.486 --> 01:57:10.829]  This is an operating manual.
[01:57:11.610 --> 01:57:19.995]  People ask me, how do you combat and survive the endless stream of smear and innuendo against you?
[01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:22.516]  The answer is the rules in this book.
[01:57:23.076 --> 01:57:25.618]  We'll pick it up and talk about it on the other side.
[01:57:43.877 --> 01:57:52.725]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:57:53.946 --> 01:57:55.747]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:57:55.807 --> 01:58:02.913]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:03.334 --> 01:58:09.059]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:09.799 --> 01:58:11.120]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:30.792]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:31.873 --> 01:58:35.996]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:36.316 --> 01:58:41.579]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[01:58:41.999 --> 01:58:43.040]  As above, so below.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.422]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:47.322 --> 01:58:48.403]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:48.903 --> 01:58:50.024]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:50.424 --> 01:58:51.905]  America is building its wall.
[01:58:52.326 --> 01:58:52.786]  Will it work?
[01:58:52.926 --> 01:58:53.446]  We don't know.
[01:58:53.907 --> 01:58:54.507]  Is Trump right?
[01:58:55.188 --> 01:58:57.309]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:58:57.809 --> 01:59:01.412]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work.
[01:59:01.812 --> 01:59:03.773]  And without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:04.154 --> 01:59:08.817]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family.
[01:59:08.837 --> 01:59:10.038]  And I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:10.778 --> 01:59:17.081]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:17.821 --> 01:59:21.082]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:21.182 --> 01:59:32.827]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:33.507 --> 01:59:35.868]  This is a 360 non-zero-sum game win.
[01:59:36.528 --> 01:59:39.749]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:43.811]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:46.232 --> 01:59:52.154]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.188 --> 02:00:10.350]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:13.751]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.052 --> 02:00:18.453]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.872 --> 02:00:37.605]  Quite obviously I'm not Alex Jones, but I'm honored to be here stepping into his very big shoes to carry the fight for freedom and our message, our Paul Revere style alert to the American people.
[02:00:38.345 --> 02:00:41.066]  That there's a coup afoot in this country.
[02:00:41.586 --> 02:01:00.031]  There's an illegal, unconstitutional power play to strip the American people of the right to make their own decisions about the country's destination, the country's direction, through the constitutional electoral process.
[02:01:01.058 --> 02:01:04.380]  That's what the federal judge in Virginia said.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.703]  The Manafort investigation has nothing to do with poor Paul Manafort.
[02:01:10.504 --> 02:01:21.231]  The government continues to lie in discovery in the Manafort cases, insisting that he was never under government surveillance.
[02:01:22.071 --> 02:01:26.753]  The government claims I was never under government surveillance.
[02:01:27.273 --> 02:01:45.481]  But there is no question that the New York Times reported on January 20th, 2017, that the Obama administration obtained FISA warrants to spy on Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and Carter Page.
[02:01:46.570 --> 02:01:48.952]  What was their probable cause?
[02:01:49.592 --> 02:01:50.112]  Simple.
[02:01:50.833 --> 02:01:53.675]  We were supporting Donald Trump for president.
[02:01:54.475 --> 02:01:59.298]  And Paul Manafort is much, much smarter than Robby Mook.
[02:01:59.919 --> 02:02:03.781]  Paul Manafort took Robby Mook to the cleaners.
[02:02:04.502 --> 02:02:13.268]  Just for the record, Steve Bannon, a veritable vagabond, had virtually nothing to do with the election of Donald Trump.
[02:02:14.088 --> 02:02:20.924]  Paul Manafort helped Donald Trump devise a plan for the general election that went on autopilot!
[02:02:22.059 --> 02:02:44.754]  Bannon, who thinks he's smarter than Trump, and actually thought he was going to run for president, when in fact he'll be in prison for secretly representing a foreign power, that's my opinion, before this is all over, during his short White House tenure, in which he helped get Rex Tillerson and H.R.
[02:02:44.774 --> 02:02:51.759]  McMaster and other globalists in place, had virtually nothing to do with the election of Donald Trump.
[02:02:52.539 --> 02:02:58.123]  Now, I'm not saying that Manafort elected Trump or that Stone elected Trump.
[02:02:58.203 --> 02:02:58.704]  No, folks.
[02:02:59.464 --> 02:03:02.026]  Donald Trump elected Donald Trump.
[02:03:03.007 --> 02:03:05.028]  He is the master of his own fate.
[02:03:05.929 --> 02:03:09.611]  And he didn't run for president because he needed to be somebody.
[02:03:10.032 --> 02:03:11.132]  Here he was somebody.
[02:03:11.833 --> 02:03:21.079]  He didn't run for president because, like Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George Bush, he needed to amass a
[02:03:22.162 --> 02:03:25.043]  Enormous fortune by lining his own pockets.
[02:03:25.503 --> 02:03:27.644]  He already had an enormous fortune.
[02:03:28.504 --> 02:03:33.666]  Donald Trump's company has lost money because of his presidency.
[02:03:34.226 --> 02:03:38.788]  He is doing this to his own financial detriment.
[02:03:38.808 --> 02:03:38.868]  Why?
[02:03:39.448 --> 02:03:41.309]  Because he loves America.
[02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:46.271]  And he's sick and tired of seeing what's happening to this country.
[02:03:47.071 --> 02:03:49.174]  He's not mad, folks.
[02:03:49.495 --> 02:03:50.656]  He's angry.
[02:03:51.357 --> 02:03:55.683]  Angry at the decline of the greatest country on Earth.
[02:03:56.404 --> 02:04:02.493]  Fed up with their endless foreign wars, where our inherent national interest was never clear.
[02:04:03.862 --> 02:04:07.406]  Fed up with the erosion of our civil liberties.
[02:04:07.987 --> 02:04:13.052]  Fed up with a stagnant economy and the lack of jobs and opportunity.
[02:04:13.593 --> 02:04:18.998]  Fed up with an immigration system that leaves our streets and neighborhoods unsafe.
[02:04:19.719 --> 02:04:26.302]  Fed up with big, multinational trade deals that suck the jobs out of America.
[02:04:26.942 --> 02:04:35.226]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll be right back with our legal analyst, Tyler Nixon.
[02:04:56.471 --> 02:05:14.760]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:05:14.861 --> 02:05:20.283]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:05:21.144 --> 02:05:21.824]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:05:21.944 --> 02:05:25.086]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:05:25.746 --> 02:05:26.726]  And so much more.
[02:05:27.286 --> 02:05:28.407]  It is concentrated.
[02:05:28.647 --> 02:05:30.347]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:05:30.367 --> 02:05:36.069]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:05:36.169 --> 02:05:37.369]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:05:37.389 --> 02:05:39.330]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:41.790]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:43.251]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:05:43.431 --> 02:05:45.231]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:05:45.791 --> 02:05:46.391]  Immune Wall.
[02:05:46.512 --> 02:05:49.112]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:09.546 --> 02:06:36.230]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones Welcome back
[02:06:37.122 --> 02:06:39.645]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:56.745]  Some of you may remember that not many months ago, I was charged in a court in New York City with defamation by a candidate for governor who I had helped defeat because he was a nut job.
[02:06:59.249 --> 02:07:27.568]  The lawsuit against me, which should have been dismissed for any lack of evidence, was allowed to go forward by a left-wing Tammany Hall judge and ultimately went to an all-Democratic jury of Manhattanites, who are, of course, some of the most critical individuals in the country when it comes to President Donald Trump.
[02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:34.752]  The jury found for me in an extraordinary legal victory.
[02:07:35.413 --> 02:07:43.197]  Now, when I was charged with defamation, it was, of course, on the front pages of the New York newspapers.
[02:07:43.898 --> 02:07:53.584]  When I was cleared, well, you could go to page 47 and there was a small box on the bottom right that reported the news.
[02:07:54.622 --> 02:08:08.451]  I'm happy to say, though, that one of the legal architects, and I had an extraordinary legal team, but one of the legal architects of this victory was my friend and personal attorney, Tyler Nixon.
[02:08:09.032 --> 02:08:19.219]  He is, of course, of the Nixon clan, of Richard M. Nixon fame, and he joins us now on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.679 --> 02:08:22.041]  Tyler, I'm glad you were able to join us.
[02:08:23.616 --> 02:08:24.917]  Always good to be with you, Roger.
[02:08:26.058 --> 02:08:33.362]  I'm glad to see your personal motto there across the splash page of your Facebook feed.
[02:08:35.124 --> 02:08:50.634]  I really want to focus today on your analysis of the lawsuits that have been filed against yours truly, the Project for Democracy lawsuit, the phony DNC lawsuit,
[02:08:51.514 --> 02:09:10.844]  And their connection to the nine meritless, frivolous lawsuits that have been filed against Alex Jones and InfoWars, because this is something that you have termed lawfare, the new tactic by the left.
[02:09:13.479 --> 02:09:14.100]  Yes, indeed.
[02:09:14.201 --> 02:09:26.563]  I mean, this is the weaponization of the judiciary, the weaponization of our legal process by people who have no concern, no care,
[02:09:27.193 --> 02:09:35.878]  No interest in serving, particularly on the attorney level, in serving the system in a just, judicial, or ethical way.
[02:09:36.739 --> 02:09:42.162]  These are partisans who will use any tactics they can available, and this is one of them.
[02:09:42.362 --> 02:09:48.446]  I've read through this lawsuit, in particular the more recent BNC lawsuit, and it is a disgrace
[02:09:49.236 --> 02:09:56.879]  Absolute disgrace, because there is just absolutely no stated, not even a shred of actual evidence.
[02:09:57.099 --> 02:10:07.143]  I mean, they have taken a miasma of news reports that are in many cases just, you know, news reports upon news reports, lies upon lies.
[02:10:07.863 --> 02:10:12.865]  They've thrown it all together into this witch's brew of allegations and
[02:10:13.797 --> 02:10:25.765]  You know, purported charges and speculation and conjecture, and whipped it up and thought, well, you know what, if we throw 66 pages together, that'll be enough to get it in the court, get our headlines.
[02:10:26.486 --> 02:10:42.457]  And of course, the worst tactic of all, I think, is, this is a tactic you use, they would use with, you know, mafia figures and people like that, where they would basically put you into a lawsuit with
[02:10:43.694 --> 02:10:56.723]  See figures in other words, so you're a co-defendants with the Russian intelligence services to create the impression of guilt by association Where oh wow look Roger Stone's a co-defendant with Vladimir Putin kind of thing.
[02:10:57.103 --> 02:10:57.323]  You know.
[02:10:57.363 --> 02:11:00.586]  It's just I mean it is very sinister It's diabolical.
[02:11:01.046 --> 02:11:02.027]  It's underhanded.
[02:11:02.487 --> 02:11:13.014]  It's disgraceful It's exactly how they operate and don't kid yourselves folks Robert Mueller is exact is it operating exactly the same way in a parallel track
[02:11:13.654 --> 02:11:14.955]  I mean, these are just
[02:11:33.212 --> 02:11:34.813]  Literal lawfare, as we would say.
[02:11:34.893 --> 02:11:58.125]  I mean, this is the Democrats, the leftists, are essentially, again, abusing our justice system, abusing due process, abusing the ability to put a lawsuit into action in a court, and knowing, as was the case with the lawsuit against you, Roger, where you're able to use the process itself
[02:11:58.883 --> 02:12:07.230]  To punish someone, to punish a political opponent, to drag them through the process because you can just make it past certain points each time.
[02:12:07.791 --> 02:12:13.155]  You can just state enough to get past a motion for summary judgment or a motion to dismiss.
[02:12:13.635 --> 02:12:21.142]  And, you know, you turn the actual need to fight a lawsuit into a weapon itself whether you prevail or not at the end.
[02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:34.115]  Tyler, our courts are not supposed to be treated like some free ferry service for legal fishing expeditions cooked up by disgruntled election losers who are out for revenge.
[02:12:34.896 --> 02:12:37.617]  If they were, our entire system would be broken.
[02:12:38.277 --> 02:12:40.738]  But then maybe that's what the leftist Democrats want.
[02:12:40.858 --> 02:12:52.083]  Every little dispute hashed out by lawyers in black robes who in turn are appointed by politicians of the same stripe to make sure even when they lose, they win.
[02:12:52.103 --> 02:12:58.326]  I think Owen Schroer, who is stationed right there at the NRA convention in Dallas,
[02:12:58.906 --> 02:13:21.315]  is able to join us and I'd like to bring him into this conversation if we could, because the lawsuits that InfoWars are facing are every bit as insidious, every bit as dangerous, every bit as abusive as the lawsuits that I am facing.
[02:13:21.975 --> 02:13:24.016]  And as I said in the first segment,
[02:13:24.989 --> 02:13:28.372]  I don't like having to come on InfoWars and beg.
[02:13:29.152 --> 02:13:34.816]  I don't like having to go on my own personal Facebook page and beg.
[02:13:35.377 --> 02:13:40.280]  But I am facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees
[02:13:41.141 --> 02:13:51.149]  Ultimately, perhaps projected to be as much as a million dollars because I have a witch hunt investigation by the House Intelligence Committee.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:58.075]  I still have open investigations by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:13:58.635 --> 02:14:05.180]  I have the Obama front project for democracy using a frivolous lawsuit against me.
[02:14:06.081 --> 02:14:07.722]  For fundraising purposes.
[02:14:08.323 --> 02:14:25.053]  I've now been sued along with Vladimir Putin, the Russian state, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, in a frivolous DNC lawsuit.
[02:14:25.634 --> 02:14:31.597]  A lawsuit that legal know-nothing Jeff Toobin of CNN says is a good idea.
[02:14:32.608 --> 02:14:33.748]  That's a new one on me.
[02:14:34.329 --> 02:14:41.591]  A lawsuit with no evidence or proof, but it's a good idea because maybe something will pop up in discovery.
[02:14:42.691 --> 02:14:45.132]  Are we sure that Toobin passed the bar someplace?
[02:14:45.192 --> 02:14:48.053]  Did he actually graduate from a law school?
[02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:51.814]  Because no real attorney could share that opinion.
[02:14:52.768 --> 02:14:57.992]  These lawsuits, Tyler, they threaten to bankruptcy me and my family.
[02:14:58.513 --> 02:15:04.257]  They threaten to rob my grandchildren of a college education, which I'm trying to provide for.
[02:15:04.777 --> 02:15:16.787]  So I ask people to go to stonedefensefund.com, stonedefensefund.com, and send a generous contribution, because I cannot beat these lawsuits back alone.
[02:15:18.118 --> 02:15:20.480]  On the phone with us now, Tyler Nixon.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:21.761]  He's gonna stick with us.
[02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:26.884]  We're still trying to connect with Owen Schroyer at the NRA convention.
[02:15:27.344 --> 02:15:32.988]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, where we tell you the Stone Cold Truth.
[02:15:33.769 --> 02:15:35.050]  I'll be right back.
[02:15:56.653 --> 02:15:59.155]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[02:15:59.235 --> 02:16:02.296]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[02:16:02.356 --> 02:16:04.638]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[02:16:05.238 --> 02:16:06.719]  What is the latest from the UK?
[02:16:06.839 --> 02:16:15.404]  Look, remember in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[02:16:15.424 --> 02:16:19.606]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[02:16:19.646 --> 02:16:22.528]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[02:16:22.628 --> 02:16:23.969]  It would have been mad!
[02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:32.252]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[02:16:32.292 --> 02:16:34.693]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:37.014]  Trust Middle England.
[02:16:37.414 --> 02:16:38.874]  Trust Middle America.
[02:16:38.894 --> 02:16:42.656]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[02:16:43.016 --> 02:16:46.877]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[02:16:47.438 --> 02:16:48.338]  All I can tell her
[02:16:48.978 --> 02:16:49.699]  We're good to go.
[02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:13.993]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[02:17:14.453 --> 02:17:27.280]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.481]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[02:17:29.621 --> 02:17:30.722]  You're a leading expert on this.
[02:17:30.802 --> 02:17:32.683]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[02:17:32.943 --> 02:17:33.864]  Why are they trying to flood?
[02:17:34.909 --> 02:17:36.049]  Because they hate Christianity.
[02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:47.693]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[02:17:47.733 --> 02:17:48.554]  They deny that.
[02:17:48.994 --> 02:17:52.655]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[02:17:52.715 --> 02:17:53.915]  They want to get rid of it.
[02:17:54.416 --> 02:18:02.338]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[02:18:02.678 --> 02:18:04.419]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[02:18:05.149 --> 02:18:10.353]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[02:18:10.393 --> 02:18:16.418]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[02:18:16.718 --> 02:18:24.824]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[02:18:24.844 --> 02:18:30.708]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[02:18:30.748 --> 02:18:31.909]  And look, what's really happening here?
[02:18:31.929 --> 02:18:34.231]  You know, don't underestimate
[02:18:34.831 --> 02:18:37.795]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[02:18:38.115 --> 02:18:39.196]  The victory of Brexit.
[02:18:39.476 --> 02:18:40.397]  The victory of Trump.
[02:18:41.018 --> 02:18:41.859]  You know, we're winning.
[02:18:42.199 --> 02:18:43.281]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[02:18:43.521 --> 02:18:51.149]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[02:18:51.229 --> 02:18:52.030]  And you know something?
[02:18:52.571 --> 02:18:53.372]  If we can resist,
[02:18:54.168 --> 02:19:03.276]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[02:19:03.316 --> 02:19:05.057]  So don't get down, everybody.
[02:19:05.358 --> 02:19:06.198]  Don't get depressed.
[02:19:06.539 --> 02:19:09.041]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[02:19:09.858 --> 02:19:15.621]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose the game and privately cheered him up and cheered up the troops.
[02:19:15.961 --> 02:19:18.762]  And you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[02:19:19.042 --> 02:19:19.702]  You're amazing.
[02:19:19.923 --> 02:19:20.603]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:19:20.663 --> 02:19:21.483]  I know you're very busy.
[02:19:22.064 --> 02:19:23.424]  But that's as the EU has said.
[02:19:23.464 --> 02:19:25.945]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[02:19:25.985 --> 02:19:29.367]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[02:19:30.602 --> 02:19:43.275]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[02:19:43.635 --> 02:19:49.121]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[02:19:49.601 --> 02:19:50.923]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[02:19:57.452 --> 02:20:00.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:20.402]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:20:20.903 --> 02:20:23.604]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:27.679 --> 02:20:28.361]  Welcome back.
[02:20:30.746 --> 02:20:36.397]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone.
[02:20:39.992 --> 02:20:46.173]  Joining us is our legal analyst and libertarian activist, Tyler Nixon.
[02:20:46.833 --> 02:21:03.197]  Tyler, you recently brought my attention to an extraordinary performance by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook on CNN when he was interviewed by the snowflake Jake Tapper.
[02:21:04.197 --> 02:21:06.017]  Give us your analysis.
[02:21:06.057 --> 02:21:07.918]  Tell the listeners and viewers.
[02:21:08.638 --> 02:21:10.419]  What Mr. Mook had to say.
[02:21:10.439 --> 02:21:16.460]  Yeah, well, you know, this guy, they keep dredging him back up.
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:17.361]  He's a loser.
[02:21:17.861 --> 02:21:19.021]  He lost the campaign.
[02:21:19.121 --> 02:21:26.183]  I mean, look, he got his pants beat off by Manafort and the brilliant leaders over at the Trump campaign.
[02:21:26.243 --> 02:21:28.364]  So, you know, he's basically embittered.
[02:21:28.945 --> 02:21:34.468]  He reflects the Hillary Clinton sort of milieu of just nastiness.
[02:21:34.508 --> 02:21:37.390]  They are going to go out and try to destroy Donald Trump.
[02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:42.093]  They are sore losers, the sorest of losers we've ever seen, and Mook is one of them.
[02:21:42.834 --> 02:21:49.158]  You know, he came on this show, and of course, you know, they gave him, Tapper gave him just free reign to say whatever he wanted.
[02:21:49.518 --> 02:21:51.079]  He called you out by name.
[02:21:52.721 --> 02:21:54.023]  This is what they've done.
[02:21:54.043 --> 02:21:57.648]  This is how the leftist media operates.
[02:21:58.048 --> 02:22:06.019]  Now you recall there was this secret cabal of journalists called the Journalist, run by Ezra Klein.
[02:22:06.039 --> 02:22:08.382]  Now these people were coordinating their message.
[02:22:09.143 --> 02:22:17.265]  Secretly in this private email list, behind the scenes, as to what the message would be, how they would help Barack Obama.
[02:22:17.505 --> 02:22:19.346]  I mean, a literal cabal of journalists.
[02:22:19.506 --> 02:22:22.046]  But of course, we're the conspiracy theorists, right?
[02:22:22.586 --> 02:22:29.108]  So this is exactly the kind of thing done in the case, and I've noticed in the case of you, what they do, Roger, is they take the story,
[02:22:29.808 --> 02:22:30.489]  We're good to go.
[02:22:51.665 --> 02:22:54.347]  Is a, you know, is an arm of the Russian state.
[02:22:54.367 --> 02:22:55.609]  You know, Assumption No.
[02:22:55.629 --> 02:22:59.612]  4, Roger Stone arranged, you know, is in touch with WikiLeaks and therefore in touch with the Russians.
[02:22:59.972 --> 02:23:01.053]  And on and on and on it goes.
[02:23:01.453 --> 02:23:14.564]  And what they do is, I've noticed, they'll take that story or that essential, you know, nugget of misstatement or, you know, untruth, and they'll pass it down the line of different journalists.
[02:23:15.124 --> 02:23:19.188]  So, for example, you'll have, you know, recently you had Jonathan Chait writing his
[02:23:19.788 --> 02:23:20.790]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:23:32.216 --> 02:23:32.496]  I think so.
[02:23:52.310 --> 02:24:00.354]  Where you go around the circle, and you're supposed to repeat a certain phrase, and by the time it gets all the way around, you're laughing your heads off because it's ridiculous.
[02:24:00.414 --> 02:24:02.115]  It sounds nothing like the original story.
[02:24:02.375 --> 02:24:06.177]  Well, that's exactly what these people are doing on a national level to you, and to others.
[02:24:06.198 --> 02:24:08.719]  To you in particular, Roger, I mean, it's really a disgrace.
[02:24:08.759 --> 02:24:15.763]  I mean, it makes me sick to my stomach, frankly, just as a person who's fair and ethical-minded, to see this happen to someone.
[02:24:15.783 --> 02:24:19.865]  Because, you know, I know you well enough, and I know up close that this is such a crock
[02:24:20.745 --> 02:24:22.566]  A crock of shit, frankly, is what it is.
[02:24:22.586 --> 02:24:31.892]  I'm almost speechless here, because it disgusts me to no end, what they've done.
[02:24:32.353 --> 02:24:38.136]  And you see another one come out, it's like, my God, you've just beaten back the last raft of bullshit they've floated at you.
[02:24:38.697 --> 02:24:41.078]  And here comes another one, with a new twist to it.
[02:24:42.339 --> 02:24:47.685]  What they don't seem to understand is that I thrive on combat.
[02:24:48.225 --> 02:24:53.270]  Now, Adam Schiff, Eric, the dumb surfer boy, Swalwell,
[02:24:54.406 --> 02:24:58.047]  Diane, octogenarian, criminal, brain-dead senator.
[02:24:58.607 --> 02:25:00.348]  They enjoy congressional immunity.
[02:25:00.948 --> 02:25:02.188]  They can smear you.
[02:25:02.308 --> 02:25:04.389]  They can utilize innuendo.
[02:25:04.449 --> 02:25:05.669]  They can state falsehoods.
[02:25:06.069 --> 02:25:07.229]  There are no consequences.
[02:25:07.789 --> 02:25:10.230]  Mook, on the other hand, is another question.
[02:25:10.810 --> 02:25:14.431]  Now, he publicly accused me of treason and criminal activity.
[02:25:15.451 --> 02:25:17.372]  And he is subject to the courts.
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:20.523]  Now, I have enough defensive actions.
[02:25:20.603 --> 02:25:23.806]  I've got to beat back the phony lawsuits against me.
[02:25:24.447 --> 02:25:28.031]  But I'm thinking seriously about suing Mr. Mook.
[02:25:28.472 --> 02:25:30.454]  Running up his legal bills.
[02:25:30.974 --> 02:25:33.958]  Bringing, calling him to account for his lies.
[02:25:34.038 --> 02:25:35.099]  I want to confront him.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:36.941]  Mook, I hope you're listening.
[02:25:37.722 --> 02:25:40.886]  Show us the proof that the Russians hacked the DNC.
[02:25:41.267 --> 02:25:44.330]  Show us the proof that the DNC was hacked at all.
[02:25:44.591 --> 02:25:46.673]  You wouldn't let the FBI see their servers.
[02:25:47.214 --> 02:25:50.658]  Show us the proof that I received anything for the Russians.
[02:25:51.019 --> 02:25:54.623]  Show us the evidence that I passed anything on to WikiLeaks.
[02:25:54.984 --> 02:25:56.225]  Because if you cannot,
[02:25:56.926 --> 02:25:58.487]  I want a judgment against you.
[02:25:59.148 --> 02:26:00.369]  I'm coming for you, Mook.
[02:26:00.769 --> 02:26:07.435]  And I've got a mean-ass lawyer named Tyler Nixon, who's gonna take your miserable ass to the cleaners.
[02:26:08.756 --> 02:26:12.339]  Well, I think being Robbie Mook is punishment in itself.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:16.262]  But that being said, he was careful, I must unfortunately say.
[02:26:16.282 --> 02:26:19.205]  And you know, it's funny, because he would have gone on
[02:26:20.083 --> 02:26:27.029]  With repeating this defamation, Roger, but guess who interrupted him and corrected him and made sure that he walked it back right on the air right there?
[02:26:27.369 --> 02:26:28.070]  Jake Tapper.
[02:26:28.650 --> 02:26:29.511]  Jake Tapper was smart.
[02:26:29.551 --> 02:26:36.757]  You know, this is how they look out for the Clinton-esque or the Clintonites and the Obamaites, you know, to make sure that we want to protect our people.
[02:26:37.117 --> 02:26:42.021]  We wouldn't want them to get sued like they're waging a lawfare campaign against you and others.
[02:26:42.661 --> 02:26:43.962]  And, you know, the bottom line is this.
[02:26:44.282 --> 02:26:58.589]  Robby Mook, for example, has overseen illegal payments or, you know, or let's just say unreported contributions to the campaign money that was shuttled to Fusion GPS by this law firm, Perkins Coie.
[02:26:59.070 --> 02:27:07.134]  And there is an FEC complaint currently against the Clinton campaign against Hillary for America pending, which of course, you know, has been held up.
[02:27:07.174 --> 02:27:09.595]  They've had to sue the FEC just to get action on it.
[02:27:10.115 --> 02:27:15.797]  In which they basically disguised these payments as legal fees and compliance fees.
[02:27:16.137 --> 02:27:17.738]  Now, Robby Mook oversaw that.
[02:27:18.018 --> 02:27:32.744]  So he was paying, he was overseeing the payment of Fusion GPS to create the fake, dirty dossier, disguising it behind the mask of a law firm in order to deceive the American people about what they were really, who they were paying, who they were buying.
[02:27:33.625 --> 02:27:48.487]  And of course, this entire Fusion GPS dossier is what launched the entire Mueller campaign, the Mueller effort against the President, which is, I mean, boy, don't get me started on that, or if you want to get me started, I'm glad to go into it, because I think it's disgusting.
[02:27:49.039 --> 02:27:51.541]  Well, we've got about just a minute left here.
[02:27:51.561 --> 02:28:00.847]  I want to thank Tyler Nixon, who always is on the money with his acute legal analysis for both the Alex Jones Show and The War Room.
[02:28:01.468 --> 02:28:02.128]  Here's the thing.
[02:28:02.649 --> 02:28:10.875]  When you win a successful presidential campaign as the campaign manager, you can dine out on it forever.
[02:28:11.435 --> 02:28:16.759]  You are assured a future of wealth and prominence.
[02:28:17.964 --> 02:28:24.228]  Take Ed Rollins, for example, a stone-cold loser who dined out on Ronald Reagan's great victory for years.
[02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:30.312]  Robbie Mook will go down in history and will die a penniless loser.
[02:28:30.933 --> 02:28:33.234]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:33.555 --> 02:28:35.296]  Thank you for Tyler Nixon joining us.
[02:28:35.676 --> 02:28:40.980]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroer from the NRA Convention in Dallas, Texas.

[02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:10.083]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:11.864 --> 02:30:18.206]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[02:31:56.377 --> 02:31:57.798]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:31:57.838 --> 02:31:59.299]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:31:59.359 --> 02:31:59.699]  Go ahead.
[02:31:59.819 --> 02:32:00.100]  Yes.
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:01.260]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:01.361 --> 02:32:07.565]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:32:07.765 --> 02:32:11.748]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:32:11.988 --> 02:32:13.429]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:32:13.809 --> 02:32:20.494]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:32:20.574 --> 02:32:23.436]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:32:24.317 --> 02:32:29.019]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:32:29.059 --> 02:32:36.884]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:32:36.904 --> 02:32:42.728]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:32:42.868 --> 02:32:48.171]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:32:48.251 --> 02:32:51.253]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:32:57.322 --> 02:33:01.526]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.471 --> 02:33:13.696]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.566 --> 02:33:20.527]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.228 --> 02:33:37.235]  It's been a topsy-turvy day because I led the top of the judge report this morning in a bogus CNBC report that says that I am now in special counselor Robert Mueller's crosshairs.
[02:33:38.115 --> 02:33:48.738]  Because of my close relationship, which is in fact virtually non-existent, with former Trump campaign staffer Rick Gates.
[02:33:49.798 --> 02:34:02.822]  They're probing the dinners we had, except for we didn't have any but one with many other people present to discuss the delegation to the Republican National Convention from New York State.
[02:34:03.502 --> 02:34:09.008]  They're investigating the meetings I had with Gates at Trump Tower.
[02:34:09.448 --> 02:34:12.511]  Except for I didn't have any, not a one.
[02:34:13.332 --> 02:34:20.319]  They are focused on the work that Gates and I did together in the 80s, according to CNBC.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:25.663]  Except for we didn't do any, because I didn't know Gates in the 80s.
[02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:35.309]  This fellow, Brian Fake News Schwartz, with CNBC, has been buffaloed by somebody.
[02:34:35.909 --> 02:34:39.152]  Brian, your source is Foley Schiff.
[02:34:39.992 --> 02:34:49.399]  Joining us now from Dallas, Texas and the NRA convention is Owen Schroeske, the Russian agent.
[02:34:49.579 --> 02:34:51.901]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:52.321 --> 02:34:54.303]  Owen, I'm delighted that you can join us.
[02:34:55.644 --> 02:34:57.726]  Good to be with you, Comrade Stoneski.
[02:34:57.906 --> 02:35:00.768]  Well, I am here at the NRA convention in Dallas.
[02:35:00.848 --> 02:35:02.769]  It is very poppin', very lively.
[02:35:02.909 --> 02:35:04.571]  I will go ahead and make a prediction now.
[02:35:05.282 --> 02:35:20.620]  That the amount of funds raised for the NRA at this convention will be record for the NRA and you can thank the students of Parkland like David Hogg for helping grow the NRA to numbers and monies that they've never seen before.
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:22.943]  Roger, I've been going around here today not just
[02:35:23.743 --> 02:35:29.648]  Broadcasting live, showing people all the sights and scenes and the guns and everything, but I've been asking people one specific question.
[02:35:30.168 --> 02:35:33.091]  What do they think about the Robert Mueller investigation?
[02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:41.017]  There is not one person that I have found here, and you can say, well, you might expect that from an NRA crowd, but there's thousands and thousands of people here and their opinion matters too.
[02:35:42.496 --> 02:35:43.737]  Nobody here believes it, Roger.
[02:35:44.037 --> 02:35:46.400]  Nobody here believes that Trump colluded with Russia.
[02:35:46.941 --> 02:35:51.766]  Nobody here thinks that the Mueller investigation is actually looking for Russian collusion.
[02:35:51.846 --> 02:35:56.170]  Everybody understands that it's just to try to remove Trump or to undermine his presidency.
[02:35:56.851 --> 02:36:02.317]  And it's amazing how they keep doubling down, tripling down, quadrupling down, repeating the same news cycles.
[02:36:02.737 --> 02:36:10.323]  Telling the same fake news and then expanding the range of the probe into anyone Donald Trump has ever communicated with.
[02:36:10.703 --> 02:36:17.868]  Or maybe, you know, maybe you used the same toilet that Donald Trump used in the same bathroom at the same hotel 20 years ago.
[02:36:18.108 --> 02:36:22.411]  Now you might be in Mueller's crosshairs because you used the same toilet as Donald Trump.
[02:36:22.712 --> 02:36:23.912]  This is how absurd it's gotten.
[02:36:24.233 --> 02:36:25.674]  But nobody buys it, Roger.
[02:36:25.774 --> 02:36:26.915]  That's the amazing thing.
[02:36:26.955 --> 02:36:28.676]  We have this investigation going on.
[02:36:29.446 --> 02:36:36.731]  Totally fake, totally fraudulent, wasting taxpayer dollars, really tearing this country apart, and nobody buys it.
[02:36:36.791 --> 02:36:44.056]  This is so unprecedented that I don't even think we understand the truly historical context of this.
[02:36:44.176 --> 02:36:45.217]  This is Stalin-esque.
[02:36:45.277 --> 02:36:46.298]  This is Kafka-esque.
[02:36:46.338 --> 02:36:51.121]  This is 1984 in the flesh that we're seeing right now, Roger, and we are in the middle of it.
[02:36:51.161 --> 02:36:52.342]  We are in the forefront of it.
[02:36:52.742 --> 02:36:56.565]  A fake investigation to bring down a duly elected president.
[02:36:56.605 --> 02:36:58.526]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:37:00.097 --> 02:37:02.420]  Well, I completely agree with you, Owen.
[02:37:02.821 --> 02:37:15.459]  My concern, my fear, is that Mueller is inviting a spasm of violence in this country that will lead to a virtual armed civil war.
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:17.360]  This is not 1963.
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:20.821]  This is not 1974.
[02:37:21.301 --> 02:37:24.542]  We will not go gladly into that good night.
[02:37:24.962 --> 02:37:28.223]  They are not going to strip our constitutional freedoms.
[02:37:28.603 --> 02:37:31.584]  They are not going to strip us of our civil liberties.
[02:37:31.984 --> 02:37:34.724]  They are not going to erase our borders.
[02:37:35.164 --> 02:37:40.386]  They are not going to take down Donald Trump in some illegitimate coup.
[02:37:41.226 --> 02:37:41.966]  Adam Schiff
[02:37:43.251 --> 02:37:50.860]  Eric Swalwell, Ted Light in the Loafer's Loo, Senator Mark Warner.
[02:37:51.501 --> 02:37:53.983]  No, you will be held responsible.
[02:37:54.364 --> 02:37:59.370]  You will be hunted down and hounded for your illegal activities.
[02:38:00.090 --> 02:38:03.253]  This is a powder keg we are sitting on.
[02:38:03.714 --> 02:38:06.617]  This is why their agenda is clear.
[02:38:07.338 --> 02:38:08.479]  Get their guns.
[02:38:09.139 --> 02:38:11.081]  We have to get their guns.
[02:38:11.602 --> 02:38:14.245]  We have to also strip them of their megaphone.
[02:38:14.745 --> 02:38:16.967]  Take Alex Jones off of the internet.
[02:38:18.849 --> 02:38:21.412]  Take InfoWars off of YouTube.
[02:38:21.773 --> 02:38:22.714]  Silence them.
[02:38:22.874 --> 02:38:23.955]  Shut them down.
[02:38:24.216 --> 02:38:25.057]  Gag them.
[02:38:25.577 --> 02:38:27.680]  File these phony lawsuits.
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:30.503]  Then we can use the headlines generated.
[02:38:31.536 --> 02:38:35.199]  To rationalize our attempts to censor them.
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:50.633]  It's a slippery slope, but American patriots, the ones attending that convention, the ones who are well armed, they are not going to stand by idly and see their freedoms stripped away.
[02:38:51.273 --> 02:38:55.097]  They are not going to stand for an unconstitutional coup.
[02:38:55.737 --> 02:38:57.259]  Do you read it that way, as I do?
[02:38:58.968 --> 02:39:00.970]  Well, I think you've hit the nail on the head, Roger.
[02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:02.591]  That's the threat to these people.
[02:39:03.312 --> 02:39:07.595]  As soon as the public becomes awakened and unified, they're done.
[02:39:07.875 --> 02:39:16.422]  Everything that they've done to this country, all the lies, all the wars, all the corruption, and now this trying to remove President Trump, it's all going to be exposed.
[02:39:16.502 --> 02:39:17.904]  And I think you hit it right on the head.
[02:39:18.244 --> 02:39:19.305]  Their biggest threat
[02:39:20.367 --> 02:39:36.632]  Politically is Donald Trump, but their biggest threat to their overall agenda worldwide government is the American people that are armed, the American people that are educated, and yes, the American people that listen to InfoWars and get news and education from us to understand exactly what's going on.
[02:39:36.672 --> 02:39:38.153]  So yeah, you hit it right on the head, Roger.
[02:39:38.713 --> 02:39:40.934]  What are they going to do right now?
[02:39:41.034 --> 02:39:44.675]  If you think about the Hillary Clintons, the James Comeys and the like,
[02:39:45.572 --> 02:39:46.312]  What are they thinking?
[02:39:46.352 --> 02:39:47.012]  What are they going to do?
[02:39:47.052 --> 02:39:48.513]  Well, they're peeing their pants.
[02:39:49.033 --> 02:39:53.534]  They are shifting their shorts because they know that justice awaits them.
[02:39:53.794 --> 02:39:55.335]  So like you said, what would you do?
[02:39:55.675 --> 02:39:57.215]  We have to get the guns.
[02:39:57.575 --> 02:40:01.736]  We have to shut down the news outlets that are reporting on our crimes.
[02:40:01.956 --> 02:40:02.957]  We have to shut them down.
[02:40:02.997 --> 02:40:03.957]  This cannot stand.
[02:40:04.177 --> 02:40:04.937]  So that's what it is.
[02:40:05.277 --> 02:40:10.499]  In their last desperate moment of panic to try to maintain the facade that they've been
[02:40:11.779 --> 02:40:15.723]  Robbing this country just bone dry for the last decade.
[02:40:16.043 --> 02:40:20.927]  They try to maintain this facade that oh We're we have America's best interest in mind.
[02:40:20.967 --> 02:40:21.948]  You don't need a border.
[02:40:22.228 --> 02:40:23.149]  You don't need guns.
[02:40:23.189 --> 02:40:25.991]  You don't need free speech We're trying to protect you balls.
[02:40:26.352 --> 02:40:28.333]  You're trying to destroy this country and we know it.
[02:40:28.373 --> 02:40:36.000]  So that's why they want to shut us down That's why they want to take the guns Roger because we call them out and just like you said they're afraid of justice and
[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:49.146]  And if you are a worldwide criminal and your name is known, and you know that there's armed people that, you know, might want to take things into their own hands because of your great crimes, what are you going to do?
[02:40:49.607 --> 02:40:50.707]  Take the guns.
[02:40:50.927 --> 02:40:52.448]  That's what it all comes down to, Roger.
[02:40:53.103 --> 02:40:59.728]  Well, let's be very clear, because we know that the snowflakes like David Brock are listening.
[02:41:00.228 --> 02:41:02.730]  No, we are not the ones advocating violence.
[02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:07.073]  You are the ones, through Antifa, who are utilizing violence.
[02:41:07.513 --> 02:41:10.655]  No, we are not advocating strong-arm tactics.
[02:41:11.116 --> 02:41:14.338]  You are the ones utilizing strong-arm tactics.
[02:41:14.758 --> 02:41:22.644]  Breaking into Paul Manafort's home at 5 o'clock in the morning, busting into Michael Cohen's locker in his home, in his hotel room,
[02:41:22.984 --> 02:41:25.287]  Where his legal records are kept.
[02:41:25.647 --> 02:41:30.973]  You are the ones running roughshod on our civil liberties and our constitutions.
[02:41:31.353 --> 02:41:33.556]  You are leading with your chin.
[02:41:33.916 --> 02:41:42.445]  You are begging for a violent eruption for the peaceable people in this country who aren't going to let you hijack the nation.
[02:41:43.346 --> 02:41:44.608]  I fear for America.
[02:41:45.248 --> 02:41:47.451]  I fear for our constitutional system.
[02:41:47.971 --> 02:41:56.601]  Comey, Brennan, Mueller, McCabe, Rosenstein, the weasel, you will be brought to justice.
[02:41:57.041 --> 02:41:59.464]  You will be punished in a court of law.
[02:42:00.345 --> 02:42:02.206]  Barry Obama himself!
[02:42:02.746 --> 02:42:05.067]  You sold guns to ISIS!
[02:42:05.527 --> 02:42:06.927]  You're going down!
[02:42:07.247 --> 02:42:09.328]  You will rot in a prison cell!
[02:42:09.908 --> 02:42:12.169]  The justice of the Trump Revolution!
[02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:17.530]  The justice of the American people that they voted for in the last election!
[02:42:18.011 --> 02:42:21.792]  Justice will find every one of you criminals!
[02:42:22.512 --> 02:42:29.041]  I suggest we start with the psychopath criminal, Wahhabist, John Brennan.
[02:42:29.501 --> 02:42:31.304]  Stop threatening the President!
[02:42:31.584 --> 02:42:33.266]  We're coming for you, Brennan!
[02:42:33.547 --> 02:42:34.768]  We're coming for you!
[02:42:35.649 --> 02:42:40.496]  I'm on InfoWars, it's the Alex Jones Show, and we'll be right back.
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:56.122]  Mike and Eric, Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:56.142 --> 02:42:56.562]  Go ahead.
[02:42:56.862 --> 02:42:59.043]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:42:59.063 --> 02:43:02.105]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:02.925 --> 02:43:04.026]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:04.366 --> 02:43:06.067]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:06.767 --> 02:43:08.868]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:09.088 --> 02:43:13.090]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:15.532]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:16.412 --> 02:43:18.734]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:19.094 --> 02:43:20.154]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:20.455 --> 02:43:21.335]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:21.575 --> 02:43:22.616]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:23.056 --> 02:43:24.077]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:24.117 --> 02:43:25.198]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:25.218 --> 02:43:26.058]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:26.318 --> 02:43:31.682]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:31.982 --> 02:43:36.264]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:36.505 --> 02:43:39.366]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:39.646 --> 02:43:40.027]  You understand?
[02:43:40.107 --> 02:43:41.368]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:41.748 --> 02:43:42.868]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:43.869 --> 02:43:48.751]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:49.491 --> 02:43:50.171]  Do you understand?
[02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:51.432]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:51.812 --> 02:43:53.332]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:43:55.773 --> 02:43:59.995]  We've gotten over a hundred new TV affiliates in just the last six months.
[02:44:00.075 --> 02:44:01.215]  We're on more satellites.
[02:44:02.315 --> 02:44:03.676]  We're reaching so many new people.
[02:44:03.716 --> 02:44:07.137]  They are blocking us more and more on the web, but thank God you're getting the information out.
[02:44:07.157 --> 02:44:12.139]  We're having congressional hearings about conservatives, populists, nationalists, Christians being
[02:44:13.254 --> 02:44:13.714]  Censored?
[02:44:14.374 --> 02:44:16.735]  Christian churches being persecuted by the IRS?
[02:44:17.115 --> 02:44:18.735]  I mean, this is real tyranny we're facing.
[02:44:18.835 --> 02:44:24.957]  You, the audience, are the engine, the brains, the guts, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the soul of this operation.
[02:44:25.017 --> 02:44:36.319]  And if you go to Infowarstore.com and look at the water filtration, the air filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, all of it, hundreds of t-shirts, dozens of ball caps,
[02:44:36.459 --> 02:44:39.201]  When you buy those products, you support the information war.
[02:44:39.221 --> 02:44:40.862]  But plus, you're wearing an InfoWars shirt.
[02:44:40.902 --> 02:44:42.203]  You wear it in a deep blue state area.
[02:44:42.223 --> 02:44:44.264]  You might get hit in the head with a tire iron or something.
[02:44:44.284 --> 02:44:45.145]  But you wear it everywhere else.
[02:44:45.165 --> 02:44:46.366]  You eat your lunch bought for it.
[02:44:46.386 --> 02:44:47.787]  You might meet your wife, your husband, whatever.
[02:44:47.867 --> 02:44:50.769]  This is how we just do these little things that move mountains.
[02:44:50.789 --> 02:44:53.490]  Well, you do it by wearing t-shirts, by wearing ball caps.
[02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:54.731]  You do it by having a bumper sticker.
[02:44:54.831 --> 02:44:57.813]  All the orders that come in to InfoWars have five bumper stickers.
[02:44:57.913 --> 02:45:00.175]  I'm doubling it to ten in every order.
[02:45:00.255 --> 02:45:02.977]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:03.017 --> 02:45:04.318]  Text your right to the supplement page or 888-253-3139.

[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:11.421]  That's the key.
[02:45:11.481 --> 02:45:13.621]  For stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[02:45:13.661 --> 02:45:14.181]  People love it.

[02:45:18.243 --> 02:45:19.103]  I don't have time to get to it.
[02:45:19.123 --> 02:45:19.723]  It's amazing.
[02:45:19.763 --> 02:45:22.744]  That goes with the Supermale and Superfemale Vitality like a horse and carriage.
[02:45:22.864 --> 02:45:24.005]  It is 50% off.
[02:45:24.045 --> 02:45:28.686]  Get the two together and get free shipping on the Real Red Pill and Supermale Vitality.
[02:45:28.706 --> 02:45:30.307]  They both have thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:45:30.347 --> 02:45:31.527]  The combo doesn't have any reviews.
[02:45:31.527 --> 02:45:31.907]  We're good to go.
[02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:01.430]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:01.950]  Scam.
[02:46:02.191 --> 02:46:02.651]  Uh, no.
[02:46:02.751 --> 02:46:04.211]  The water table's full of poison.
[02:46:04.331 --> 02:46:05.152]  Everybody knows that.
[02:46:05.232 --> 02:46:05.772]  It's admitted.
[02:46:05.832 --> 02:46:07.653]  You need to filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:07.673 --> 02:46:08.954]  We have the best gravity-filled systems.
[02:46:09.214 --> 02:46:14.416]  So, yes, I do a report on how the water's bad, and then I sell a water filter I use when I'm on the road or in my own home.
[02:46:14.616 --> 02:46:15.636]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:15.676 --> 02:46:23.660]  Like, if I was gonna open a franchise of a restaurant, if I was a franchisee, I would find a restaurant that I love, that was successful, and had really good food that I would want to franchise.
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:25.802]  I'd say, can I franchise your great restaurant?
[02:46:25.842 --> 02:46:29.624]  A lot of people have gone in famously to good restaurants, and they've said, I want to franchise this.
[02:46:30.005 --> 02:46:30.645]  Exactly!
[02:46:30.865 --> 02:46:33.928]  I sell what I use, and I like, and I believe in.
[02:46:34.368 --> 02:46:36.510]  But it shows Hogg, and the media thinks it's like a scam.
[02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:41.373]  He had a water filter ad after he talked about atrazine in the water causing sterility.
[02:46:42.234 --> 02:46:42.754]  Dun-dun-dun.
[02:46:42.874 --> 02:46:43.975]  Like, oh my god, it's hidden!
[02:46:43.995 --> 02:46:45.396]  They always go, Jones said this on air.
[02:46:45.456 --> 02:46:46.037]  We caught it.
[02:46:46.117 --> 02:46:46.517]  Here it is.
[02:46:46.797 --> 02:46:47.978]  It was a big secret.
[02:46:48.338 --> 02:46:49.279]  Millions were watching it.
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:51.261]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:56.941 --> 02:46:59.540]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.757 --> 02:47:26.304]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:47:26.825 --> 02:47:28.649]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.789 --> 02:47:29.991]  Welcome back!
[02:47:36.952 --> 02:47:39.634]  These are great, great days to be alive.
[02:47:39.654 --> 02:47:50.058]  We're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm Roger Stone, pinch-hitting for the great Alex Jones, who had a few personal matters to take care of today.
[02:47:50.098 --> 02:47:58.042]  And then, of course, we were hit at our Austin bunker with a power outage throughout the entire region.
[02:47:58.602 --> 02:48:02.784]  But we soldiered on using the techniques of radio
[02:48:03.464 --> 02:48:06.126]  Because the circle cannot be broken.
[02:48:06.786 --> 02:48:10.088]  The chain of information cannot be stopped.
[02:48:10.208 --> 02:48:16.833]  We are here to present the truth 365 days a year.
[02:48:18.214 --> 02:48:19.034]  It's a challenge.
[02:48:20.035 --> 02:48:30.101]  Because Soros, the globalists, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bush crime family, they want to shut us down, folks.
[02:48:30.602 --> 02:48:31.783]  And they have a strategy.
[02:48:32.625 --> 02:48:40.932]  Let's tangle Alex Jones and his entire InfoWars crew up with a series of expensive but frivolous lawsuits.
[02:48:41.452 --> 02:48:44.835]  Then those lawsuits will generate terrible headlines.
[02:48:45.315 --> 02:48:49.338]  Then we take the headline and we go to YouTube and you see, Ah!
[02:48:49.838 --> 02:48:51.320]  Alex Jones is a pervert!
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:53.241]  Alex Jones is a racist!
[02:48:53.701 --> 02:48:55.523]  Alex Jones is a misogynist!
[02:48:55.883 --> 02:48:58.085]  The people at InfoWars are Nazis!
[02:48:58.365 --> 02:48:59.806]  They're white supremacists!
[02:49:00.146 --> 02:49:01.788]  Let's take them off the internet!
[02:49:03.055 --> 02:49:04.497]  It's a scam, folks.
[02:49:05.137 --> 02:49:08.581]  But unfortunately, it's an expensive scam.
[02:49:09.442 --> 02:49:18.091]  You see, we just don't have a deep-pockets billionaire like Soros hiding in the wings, writing giant checks.
[02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:26.894]  We have to depend on the rank-and-file, freedom-loving listeners and viewers right here at the InfoWars.
[02:49:27.735 --> 02:49:31.058]  You are the ones fueling the revolution.
[02:49:31.738 --> 02:49:35.041]  You are the ones who elected Donald Trump.
[02:49:35.701 --> 02:49:47.290]  You are the ones who depend on our exposure of the corruption of the deep state and the globalist agenda to enslave us every day.
[02:49:48.311 --> 02:50:13.558]  So if you like what we do here at InfoWars, if you're digging the real news with David Knight every morning, if you like the iconic Alex Jones Show, one of the most influential programs in America, folks, a program that literally moves millions to civic action and helped elect this reformist president,
[02:50:14.258 --> 02:50:22.344]  If you like what Owen Schroyer and I are doing on The War Room every day, well then we need your support.
[02:50:22.964 --> 02:50:24.005]  We need your help.
[02:50:25.786 --> 02:50:27.427]  We've got two things going on.
[02:50:28.088 --> 02:50:31.250]  Alex Jones is trying to expand InfoWars.
[02:50:31.810 --> 02:50:36.954]  New studios, new technology, new correspondents, new people.
[02:50:38.015 --> 02:50:44.898]  But unfortunately, we still have to fight this rearguard action against these frivolous lawsuits.
[02:50:45.378 --> 02:50:50.821]  So please go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of these extraordinary specials.
[02:50:51.881 --> 02:50:55.543]  I myself like the Mind and Body Challenge.
[02:50:56.223 --> 02:50:59.725]  This is where you stack the real red pill.
[02:51:00.545 --> 02:51:06.448]  One of the very best vitamin and supplement, uh, vitamin and mineral supplements that I have found
[02:51:07.338 --> 02:51:09.621]  With Brain Force Plus.
[02:51:10.662 --> 02:51:13.446]  This stuff, folks, really works.
[02:51:14.707 --> 02:51:18.850]  Now I put in long hard hours in the fight for freedom.
[02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:36.823]  Today I'll not only be here on the Alex Jones Show, but tonight I'm joining Tucker Carlson on Fox and I believe Anderson Cooper on CNN to respond to the smear that I am now the focus of the Mueller probe.
[02:51:37.836 --> 02:51:40.177]  I wouldn't be able to do it without Brain Force Plus.
[02:51:41.038 --> 02:51:46.821]  This terrific product gives you mental energy and clarity just when you need it.
[02:51:47.281 --> 02:51:50.823]  Just at that four o'clock point when I get my dip.
[02:51:51.786 --> 02:51:53.888]  But you're not jacked.
[02:51:54.528 --> 02:51:55.709]  You're not wired.
[02:51:56.370 --> 02:51:59.192]  You're able to sleep and get a restful night's sleep.
[02:51:59.933 --> 02:52:00.974]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:52:01.694 --> 02:52:02.775]  A terrific product.
[02:52:03.416 --> 02:52:10.302]  And when you stack it with the real Red Pill, well, that's the mind-body challenge we speak of.
[02:52:11.215 --> 02:52:13.756]  Or you might want to try Alpha Power.
[02:52:14.436 --> 02:52:29.700]  When stacked with the super male vitality, what we call the Michael Zimmerman package, it gives you a rise in your libido, a rise in your energy, a rise in your manhood.
[02:52:30.697 --> 02:52:32.938]  These terrific products are all natural.
[02:52:33.498 --> 02:52:35.879]  They're the very best ingredients.
[02:52:36.379 --> 02:52:39.500]  You won't find any fillers like you do at Whole Foods.
[02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:44.961]  You won't find exorbitant prices where they make 300% profit.
[02:52:45.561 --> 02:52:57.105]  You won't find any half-empty bottles, because almost in every case, you're getting 20% more in volume by going to the InfoWars store.
[02:52:57.645 --> 02:52:59.806]  Please stop by if you don't
[02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:02.623]  Like our nutraceuticals.
[02:53:03.003 --> 02:53:03.984]  Look at the t-shirts.
[02:53:04.425 --> 02:53:05.266]  Look at the books.
[02:53:05.887 --> 02:53:08.270]  Look at the donation page.
[02:53:08.651 --> 02:53:14.939]  If you're not in the market for any product, but you want to support the fight for a free press and the First Amendment,
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:18.282]  Consider a generous donation to InfoWars.
[02:53:20.464 --> 02:53:18.282]  $25, $50, $100.
[02:53:21.725 --> 02:53:24.867]  Yes, some people even sent us as much as $500.
[02:53:27.309 --> 02:53:29.831]  We've had a few InfoWarriors just send in $1,000.
[02:53:29.871 --> 02:53:33.373]  Because they like what Alex Jones is doing.
[02:53:33.794 --> 02:53:36.035]  They like his fearlessness.
[02:53:36.596 --> 02:53:44.321]  And they know Soros and his satanic, pedophile army seeks to close us down.
[02:53:45.302 --> 02:53:55.027]  Let me tell you how insidious the tech left's efforts to close down the voices of conservatism and freedom are.
[02:53:55.907 --> 02:54:02.851]  As I mentioned, my new book, Stone's Rules, will hit bookstores on May 8th.
[02:54:03.551 --> 02:54:09.114]  Very shortly, it will be available at the InfoWars.com store.
[02:54:10.208 --> 02:54:29.771]  Yesterday, I posted on Facebook a series of ads in which I took the Amazon website link where you buy the book and I used the Google shortening technology to shorten the link and then put up the post.
[02:54:30.902 --> 02:54:39.953]  The book jumped from 48th among political books to 24th according to the Amazon count within hours.
[02:54:40.634 --> 02:54:42.436]  And then I got the bad news.
[02:54:43.217 --> 02:54:48.564]  Google shut down my shortened link saying it was spam.
[02:54:49.602 --> 02:54:56.804]  Well, when I looked at the description on Amazon of my new book, there's nothing in there that violates their standards.
[02:54:57.164 --> 02:55:00.145]  There's no curse words or hate speech.
[02:55:00.745 --> 02:55:03.866]  It's about politics, business, and style.
[02:55:04.726 --> 02:55:07.067]  It shows you how insidious
[02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:16.778]  The Deep State and their tech left allies are in their efforts to block any message but their own.
[02:55:17.519 --> 02:55:23.205]  So until we have it on InfoWars, you can find it at Amazon or Barnes and Noble.
[02:55:23.765 --> 02:55:28.810]  But if you want to get the best price, you'll find it shortly at the InfoWars store.
[02:55:29.491 --> 02:55:31.052]  I'm very proud of this book.
[02:55:31.793 --> 02:55:32.694]  People say to me,
[02:55:34.022 --> 02:55:49.714]  How do you combat the constant war of smear and innuendo and allegation that is aimed at you by the fake news and their puppet masters in the left-wing Democratic Party?
[02:55:50.575 --> 02:55:57.178]  The answer is, I adhere tightly to the rules in this book, Stone's Rules.
[02:55:57.798 --> 02:56:00.639]  These are my rules of engagement.
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:03.601]  This is my battle plan.
[02:56:04.181 --> 02:56:12.825]  This is the only book you need, besides the Bible, to succeed in business, politics, or style.
[02:56:13.325 --> 02:56:14.926]  I hope you'll get a copy.
[02:56:15.706 --> 02:56:18.007]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:18.247 --> 02:56:28.472]  We're in the forefront to expose the illegal, unconstitutional coup d'etat and to take down our duly elected president.
[02:56:28.933 --> 02:56:30.793]  We're calling out the globalists.
[02:56:30.874 --> 02:56:33.515]  We're calling out the libtards.
[02:56:33.895 --> 02:56:39.698]  We're kicking arse and taking names in the style of Alex Jones.
[02:56:39.718 --> 02:56:41.259]  I'm proud to be with you.
[02:56:42.639 --> 02:56:44.300]  And I ask you one more time.
[02:56:45.100 --> 02:56:46.841]  Stop by the Infowars store.
[02:56:47.461 --> 02:56:49.002]  We need your support.
[02:56:49.442 --> 02:56:53.024]  We are challenged and threatened as never before.
[02:56:53.844 --> 02:56:55.405]  But we will never retreat.
[02:56:55.885 --> 02:56:57.166]  We will never quit.
[02:56:57.686 --> 02:56:59.807]  We will never stop fighting.
[02:57:00.387 --> 02:57:03.972]  But we need your help to persevere and to succeed.
[02:57:04.452 --> 02:57:07.557]  We need your support for victory.
[02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.619]  Victory is in sight.
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:14.226]  Mueller, Comey, and the cucks are on the run.
[02:57:14.927 --> 02:57:17.971]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.
[02:57:43.539 --> 02:57:44.139]  Alpha Power.
[02:57:44.499 --> 02:57:45.299]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:57:45.539 --> 02:57:51.501]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:57:52.181 --> 02:57:55.721]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:57:56.582 --> 02:58:04.543]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:58:05.083 --> 02:58:08.464]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:58:09.424 --> 02:58:12.147]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:58:12.687 --> 02:58:14.388]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:58:14.749 --> 02:58:19.853]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:58:20.133 --> 02:58:28.480]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product, in them.
[02:58:28.881 --> 02:58:29.901]  Nobody else does that.
[02:58:29.982 --> 02:58:32.664]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:58:33.044 --> 02:58:35.045]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:58:35.445 --> 02:58:42.487]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:58:43.047 --> 02:58:46.628]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:47.088 --> 02:58:48.329]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:48.929 --> 02:58:49.270]  I think so.
[02:59:06.613 --> 02:59:09.994]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:10.014 --> 02:59:16.255]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:16.475 --> 02:59:21.136]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:21.656 --> 02:59:23.957]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:59:24.297 --> 02:59:25.637]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:26.037 --> 02:59:30.918]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:59:31.138 --> 02:59:35.641]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:35.761 --> 02:59:37.923]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:38.443 --> 02:59:43.326]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:59:47.529 --> 02:59:51.492]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:59.637 --> 03:00:03.539]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:03.999 --> 03:00:07.921]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:08.521 --> 03:00:11.743]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:00:14.964 --> 03:00:15.624]  Welcome back.
[03:00:18.866 --> 03:00:24.468]  I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone, and you're at Freedom Command Central.
[03:00:24.529 --> 03:00:27.410]  Yes, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:29.093 --> 03:00:41.339]  We've had a terrific show today, despite the power outages in the Austin, Texas area, where we broadcast from a bunker in an undisclosed location.
[03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:49.574]  But using the techniques of old-time radio, the chain was unbroken.
[03:00:50.314 --> 03:01:11.989]  And we were continuing to broadcast to bring you the cutting-edge news about a federal judge slapping down Robert Mueller for his naked attempts to manipulate the system in the Get Donald Trump Squad that is the Office of Special Prosecutor.
[03:01:12.910 --> 03:01:23.642]  The appointment of Rod Rosenstein, in my opinion, is the single most egregious mistake by President Donald Trump.
[03:01:24.750 --> 03:01:32.775]  Rosenstein was recommended for the job by the former Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus.
[03:01:33.416 --> 03:01:42.682]  Frankly, I've had it up to here with Priebus, a political and mental midget who probably didn't even vote for Donald Trump.
[03:01:43.382 --> 03:01:54.428]  But who virtually destroyed the early days of the Trump presidency by staffing the government with Trump-hating Bushites.
[03:01:55.669 --> 03:02:11.618]  Now we have an incredible fake news story by CNBC that says Mueller is probing my close relationship with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates and a relationship that virtually doesn't exist.
[03:02:12.668 --> 03:02:18.531]  Any contact I had with Gates in 2016 was both minimal and innocuous.
[03:02:19.231 --> 03:02:21.052]  Nothing there to see, folks.
[03:02:21.612 --> 03:02:23.433]  It's fake news.
[03:02:23.893 --> 03:02:26.634]  More and more fake news.
[03:02:27.415 --> 03:02:32.697]  I believe we have a video coming up from the great Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:02:33.277 --> 03:02:40.781]  But in the meantime, I'm going to ask you one more time to recognize that everything we're doing here costs money.
[03:02:41.681 --> 03:02:50.645]  And that we have no subsidy, no George Soros of the right bailing us out and paying our way.
[03:02:51.845 --> 03:02:56.947]  What Alex Jones has built here at InfoWars is truly extraordinary.
[03:02:57.668 --> 03:02:59.848]  We've become the tip of the spear.
[03:03:00.509 --> 03:03:02.590]  We are the ones they fear.
[03:03:03.230 --> 03:03:08.192]  This is why you've seen an unalloyed campaign to shut us down and silence us.
[03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:21.898]  I really hope that conservative thought leaders like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and so many others will recognize that if they gag Alex Jones, they are next.
[03:03:22.718 --> 03:03:25.300]  This is about the fight for freedom.
[03:03:25.841 --> 03:03:28.262]  This is about the First Amendment.
[03:03:28.863 --> 03:03:35.748]  They are still reeling from the fact that they've lost control of their monopoly on political discourse.
[03:03:36.528 --> 03:03:47.451]  In the old days, ABC, NBC, CBS, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, they called the shots.
[03:03:48.376 --> 03:03:49.436]  There was no dissent.
[03:03:50.157 --> 03:03:52.357]  There was no alternative opinion.
[03:03:52.897 --> 03:03:55.778]  Things went down the way they said they did.
[03:03:56.578 --> 03:03:58.119]  Today, it's a new day.
[03:03:58.139 --> 03:04:07.102]  InfoWars is at the cutting edge of a robust and vibrant alternative media that brings the people the truth.
[03:04:07.602 --> 03:04:17.785]  And the people responded with the historic election of an outsider uncontrolled by the Trilateral Commission, Donald J. Trump.
[03:04:18.465 --> 03:04:23.749]  Now they want to illegally undo the results of the last election.
[03:04:24.369 --> 03:04:28.652]  But to do so, they must shut us down and take our guns.
[03:04:29.232 --> 03:04:30.613]  Don't let it happen, folks.
[03:04:31.173 --> 03:04:31.854]  Stay with us.
[03:04:32.174 --> 03:04:33.375]  You're at InfoWars.
[03:04:58.686 --> 03:05:01.787]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:01.827 --> 03:05:02.348]  You're on the air.
[03:05:02.368 --> 03:05:03.528]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:03.548 --> 03:05:04.409]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:04.589 --> 03:05:05.209]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:05.509 --> 03:05:05.869]  Good, man.
[03:05:05.889 --> 03:05:06.690]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:07.330]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:07.430 --> 03:05:11.852]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:12.052 --> 03:05:18.435]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:18.555 --> 03:05:20.256]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:05:20.336 --> 03:05:26.519]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:27.659 --> 03:05:28.779]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:28.839 --> 03:05:31.280]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:32.841]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:33.221 --> 03:05:34.822]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:35.282 --> 03:05:36.042]  And exactly.
[03:05:36.062 --> 03:05:40.284]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:40.644 --> 03:05:40.904]  Boom!
[03:05:41.044 --> 03:05:43.885]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:43.945 --> 03:05:44.465]  It's amazing.
[03:05:44.525 --> 03:05:45.826]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:05:45.886 --> 03:05:48.767]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:05:59.393 --> 03:06:08.957]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:06:09.517 --> 03:06:11.138]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:06:14.671 --> 03:06:18.174]  Don't know if you've heard, but Kanye West has been in the news quite a bit.
[03:06:18.234 --> 03:06:22.337]  Bashed from pillar to post by every legacy media outlet under the sun.
[03:06:22.377 --> 03:06:25.979]  For the crime of promoting free thought, love, and understanding.
[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:28.741]  Which, as we all know, are racist ideas.
[03:06:28.862 --> 03:06:34.246]  He's saying these sorts of ridiculous things that are usually promoted by white nationalists.
[03:06:34.786 --> 03:06:40.210]  By friend groups, by friend individuals, mostly on the internet, that promote racist ideas.
[03:06:40.350 --> 03:06:41.451]  So let me get this straight.
[03:06:41.491 --> 03:06:54.717]  CNN's Brian Stelter, a podgy white guy who works for a multi-billionaire global corporation, is telling a black dude that he's racist for encouraging African-Americans not to listen to a global corporation and think for themselves.
[03:06:54.777 --> 03:06:59.020]  Yeah, a little less white-splaining, please, Brian, and a bit more shushy-shush.
[03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:01.901]  But Kanye said being a slave 400 years ago was a choice.
[03:07:01.941 --> 03:07:05.303]  Saying slavery was a choice is absolutely a racist idea, so stop.
[03:07:08.206 --> 03:07:11.647]  Have any of you been paying attention for like five minutes?
[03:07:11.747 --> 03:07:14.408]  Kanye was talking about mindset.
[03:07:14.488 --> 03:07:20.091]  The victimhood of slavery mindset that black people living today are told to wallow in.
[03:07:20.131 --> 03:07:23.592]  He wasn't talking about slaves having a choice 400 years ago.
[03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:26.993]  Anyone who's been following his tweets and interviews knows this.
[03:07:27.193 --> 03:07:30.015]  Why do you think Kanye resonated with Candace Owens?
[03:07:30.055 --> 03:07:31.655]  What's Candace Owens' message?
[03:07:31.755 --> 03:07:36.357]  That black people shouldn't remain mired in the victimhood mentality of slavery.
[03:07:36.397 --> 03:07:38.077]  I don't know why people like being oppressed.
[03:07:38.097 --> 03:07:39.458]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
[03:07:39.478 --> 03:07:40.258]  I love oppression!
[03:07:40.558 --> 03:07:41.118]  We're oppressed!
[03:07:41.578 --> 03:07:42.259]  400 years of slavery!
[03:07:42.279 --> 03:07:42.679]  Jim Crow!
[03:07:42.879 --> 03:07:44.839]  Which, by the way, none of you guys lived through.
[03:07:44.919 --> 03:07:48.300]  Kanye is talking about African Americans living now.
[03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:50.841]  Not slaves living hundreds of years ago.
[03:07:50.861 --> 03:07:54.282]  I mean, what kind of stupidity can we expect to encounter next?
[03:07:54.642 --> 03:07:56.362]  Kanye is a Russian agent!
[03:07:56.743 --> 03:07:56.883]  Oh.
[03:07:57.303 --> 03:07:58.143]  Look at this idiot.
[03:07:58.263 --> 03:08:09.246]  While you are making music and being an artist and living a life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.
[03:08:09.326 --> 03:08:14.167]  So whiny Mr. TMZ staffer says Donald Trump is a threat to his life.
[03:08:14.307 --> 03:08:15.247]  Give me a break!
[03:08:15.387 --> 03:08:22.249]  You're living a life infinitely more privileged than the vast majority of people, especially black people, on the planet.
[03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:23.609]  You want to know the biggest threat?
[03:08:23.869 --> 03:08:27.150]  Yeah, it's black-on-black violence.
[03:08:27.270 --> 03:08:31.051]  Oh, but you're way more outraged over a frigging MAGA hat and a few tweets.
[03:08:31.191 --> 03:08:37.732]  Conservatives, Trump supporters, and free thinkers, please do not attach yourselves to Kanye West.
[03:08:37.953 --> 03:08:38.793]  It will backfire.
[03:08:39.213 --> 03:08:41.733]  Mark my words, it will backfire.
[03:08:41.813 --> 03:08:50.276]  Yeah, conservatives embracing Kanye has backfired so badly that support for Trump amongst black males has doubled in a single week.
[03:08:50.416 --> 03:08:52.016]  Mark my words, it will backfire.
[03:08:52.416 --> 03:08:53.257]  Mark my words.
[03:08:53.278 --> 03:08:54.419]  Then we have little Ben Shapiro.
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:24.048]  The never-Trumper who tried to sabotage Trump's campaign by white-knighting for Michelle Field's made-up story about being assaulted by Corey Lewandowski with his incessantly annoying boundary policing.
[03:09:24.228 --> 03:09:28.071]  Ordering other conservatives around us to whose show they can and can't appear on.
[03:09:28.251 --> 03:09:30.552]  Foundry policing used to be called having some standards.
[03:09:30.732 --> 03:09:31.452]  Really, Ben?
[03:09:31.492 --> 03:09:32.353]  So let me get this straight.
[03:09:32.393 --> 03:09:39.055]  According to your logic, appearing on a network means you must simultaneously endorse the every viewpoint of the host.
[03:09:39.295 --> 03:09:41.096]  Well, what do we have here?
[03:09:41.116 --> 03:09:45.758]  It just demonstrates the right's desperation to be taken seriously in the sphere of pop culture.
[03:09:45.778 --> 03:09:51.440]  So if all this is just a pointless joke, why are you so butthurt about Candace appearing on Infowars?
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:53.741]  Who elected you, leader of the Thought Police?
[03:09:55.757 --> 03:09:57.459]  I'm Ben Shapiro and I'm very smart.
[03:09:57.519 --> 03:10:05.725]  Why is the guy who constantly whines about being no-platformed by the left trying to no-platform other conservatives through peer pressure?
[03:10:05.825 --> 03:10:06.766]  Here's another question.
[03:10:06.906 --> 03:10:13.332]  Why do establishment conservatives like Shapiro always try to c*** all over every fantastic opportunity?
[03:10:13.432 --> 03:10:21.959]  A chance to help millions of African Americans get off the plantation of government dependency to escape the internalized oppression of identity politics.
[03:10:22.039 --> 03:10:24.040]  I mean, is it some kind of cuckoldry thing?
[03:10:24.260 --> 03:10:25.661]  Do they like to lose?
[03:10:25.761 --> 03:10:33.766]  So we have a global celebrity with a reach of millions, exposing those millions to thoughts and ideas they would never otherwise hear.
[03:10:33.907 --> 03:10:37.469]  A method that's already proving successful in the polls.
[03:10:37.629 --> 03:10:41.611]  And people like Shapiro are pissing their pants in fear of what might happen.
[03:10:41.671 --> 03:10:45.314]  I mean, God forbid we want to actually win a battle in the culture war.
[03:10:45.714 --> 03:10:49.097]  If that happens, Shapiro might not get invited back on CNN.
[03:10:49.337 --> 03:10:56.683]  All these establishment never-Trump conservatives care about is ring-fencing ideas and maintaining their stupid little cliques.
[03:10:56.763 --> 03:11:03.788]  They're quite happy to lose to the left over and over again, so long as they can keep their crappy national review columns.
[03:11:03.909 --> 03:11:05.490]  No, bitches, your time's up.
[03:11:05.710 --> 03:11:06.471]  You're the past.
[03:11:06.751 --> 03:11:07.552]  We're the future.
[03:11:07.572 --> 03:11:10.674]  But let's move past the squabbling and get real here.
[03:11:10.674 --> 03:11:12.535]  This isn't even a left or right issue.
[03:11:12.575 --> 03:11:17.398]  Kanye has also endorsed gun control activist and leftist darling, Emma Gonzalez.
[03:11:17.458 --> 03:11:19.098]  It's not a left or right issue.
[03:11:19.218 --> 03:11:20.879]  It's an authenticity issue.
[03:11:20.919 --> 03:11:29.644]  This is about the high priests of pop culture panicking about one of their own going off the reservation and expressing independent thoughts.
[03:11:29.784 --> 03:11:34.549]  This is about Kanye becoming the embodiment of the threat of a good example.
[03:11:34.589 --> 03:11:45.882]  This is about them freaking out over Kanye encouraging other celebrities to express free thought and to reject the same tired old cliches and insipid platitudes.
[03:11:46.062 --> 03:11:49.726]  Reject the very thing that has made celebrities and pop culture
[03:11:50.006 --> 03:11:54.490]  relentlessly boring and predictable for the past two decades.
[03:11:54.571 --> 03:12:08.484]  The legacy media and establishment commentators on both left and right are also panicking because their entire business model of partisan bickering is directly threatened by Kanye's message of unity and understanding.
[03:12:08.584 --> 03:12:16.669]  Their entire narrative of demonizing anyone who fails to fall into their viciously controlled political paradigm is at risk.
[03:12:16.769 --> 03:12:19.271]  The message is about freedom of thought.
[03:12:19.411 --> 03:12:25.875]  It's about liberating oneself from the fear of how the mob will react and being truly outspoken.
[03:12:26.015 --> 03:12:31.499]  And yeah, of course Kanye's involvement is partly motivated by free publicity and album sales.
[03:12:31.539 --> 03:12:34.802]  But he's amplifying the message like no one else could.
[03:12:34.862 --> 03:12:40.366]  Kanye West might not be the most eloquent or the most intelligent vehicle for the message.
[03:12:40.526 --> 03:12:44.309]  But the message is what frightens them, nonetheless.
[03:12:48.533 --> 03:12:50.353]  Kanye West has been a brilliant entertainer.
[03:12:50.373 --> 03:12:53.534]  But right now, he's acting like a gift to racists.
[03:12:53.894 --> 03:13:00.676]  Because he is saying comments, he is saying these sorts of ridiculous things that are usually promoted by white nationalists.
[03:13:01.216 --> 03:13:06.697]  By fringe groups, by fringe individuals, mostly on the internet, that promote racist ideas.
[03:13:07.077 --> 03:13:07.837]  See, did you hear that?
[03:13:07.897 --> 03:13:14.919]  Kanye, an African American male, is a gift to racists for saying that he likes the ideas of a black woman.
[03:13:15.259 --> 03:13:16.100]  Candace Owens.
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:20.503]  Now, Kanye's been catching all sorts of heat for expressing his support for President Trump.
[03:13:20.803 --> 03:13:25.907]  Of course, the thought of an influential black man breaking through the conditioning is the left's worst nightmare.
[03:13:26.347 --> 03:13:26.627]  Why?
[03:13:26.647 --> 03:13:37.095]  Because when you let others know it's okay to get off that thought plantation and break through the pre-programmed conditioning of mental enslavement, others realize that they, too, are free.
[03:13:37.475 --> 03:13:38.196]  Perfect example?
[03:13:38.516 --> 03:13:46.502]  Before Kanye's support for Trump became one of the biggest news stories of the year, Trump's approval rating stood at just 11% amongst African American males.
[03:13:46.662 --> 03:13:53.646]  But according to Reuters, on April 29th, a week into the Kanye controversy, that figure shot up to 22%.
[03:13:54.447 --> 03:14:03.333]  Double the number of African American males now have a positive view of Trump thanks to Kanye, proving once again that politics is downstream from culture.
[03:14:03.833 --> 03:14:05.675]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[03:14:09.810 --> 03:14:13.592]  Only one of the security guys who seemed to be in charge at Whole Foods was a jerk.
[03:14:13.612 --> 03:14:16.534]  So I'm already standing on the corner of the property, off the property.
[03:14:16.554 --> 03:14:19.115]  And he came over and said, get out of here, I'm calling the police.
[03:14:19.155 --> 03:14:21.777]  And I said, well, I'm going to your parking garage to get my car.
[03:14:21.797 --> 03:14:27.140]  He wouldn't answer that and made me think I was going to get arrested when I went down there to get my car and followed me to my car.
[03:14:27.180 --> 03:14:27.980]  So I'm coming back.
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:29.461]  I'm already planning to come back.
[03:14:29.481 --> 03:14:30.942]  But now, I'm coming back a lot.
[03:14:30.962 --> 03:14:33.183]  Because people were polite to me, they were nice to me.
[03:14:33.203 --> 03:14:35.284]  Most of the folks at Whole Foods were listeners.
[03:14:36.465 --> 03:14:38.306]  In big blue state Austin.
[03:14:39.827 --> 03:14:40.967]  Blue state cancer, Austin.
[03:14:42.268 --> 03:14:45.069]  But you try to stop me and bully me, I'm coming back.
[03:14:45.109 --> 03:14:47.009]  This is a go-go zone.
[03:14:47.029 --> 03:14:51.611]  Elected to the program of the pro-America, pro-free market, pro-not-smart.
[03:14:51.631 --> 03:14:53.352]  They're programmed mainly by Jeff Bezos.
[03:14:53.412 --> 03:14:55.672]  He's the biggest funder of the Democratic Party.
[03:14:55.793 --> 03:14:58.513]  He made $12 billion in one day last week.
[03:14:58.533 --> 03:15:00.294]  He's the richest man in the world.
[03:15:00.474 --> 03:15:02.735]  He gets $1.50 on every package he ships.
[03:15:02.835 --> 03:15:06.176]  All the rest of his money was basically made at government monopolies.
[03:15:06.216 --> 03:15:07.517]  He's tax exempt.
[03:15:07.557 --> 03:15:08.377]  He basically pays no taxes.
[03:15:12.176 --> 03:15:12.756]  He's a really bad dude.
[03:15:12.817 --> 03:15:14.858]  He killed the publishing industry, now he's killing Main Street.
[03:15:14.898 --> 03:15:17.020]  So, uh, let's go ahead and let's go with the supplemental first.
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:17.320]  Here we go.
[03:15:53.581 --> 03:16:00.204]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[03:16:00.884 --> 03:16:02.685]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[03:16:03.265 --> 03:16:09.148]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[03:16:09.548 --> 03:16:12.189]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:12.449 --> 03:16:15.491]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:15.851 --> 03:16:21.754]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:22.414 --> 03:16:28.878]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:29.238 --> 03:16:35.141]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:35.621 --> 03:16:39.222]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:16:39.702 --> 03:16:47.926]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[03:16:48.306 --> 03:16:54.549]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:16:55.595 --> 03:17:00.016]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[03:17:00.656 --> 03:17:08.737]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[03:17:09.297 --> 03:17:10.978]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[03:17:11.518 --> 03:17:18.459]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:18.499 --> 03:17:21.499]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:22.980]  It's not absorbable.
[03:17:23.380 --> 03:17:23.940]  It's toxic.
[03:17:24.620 --> 03:17:36.751]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[03:17:36.871 --> 03:17:39.393]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[03:17:40.114 --> 03:17:48.503]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs.
[03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:52.688]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[03:17:53.088 --> 03:17:57.753]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[03:17:58.374 --> 03:18:01.938]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[03:18:02.218 --> 03:18:06.122]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[03:18:06.682 --> 03:18:09.425]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[03:18:09.465 --> 03:18:10.606]  We have a good supply right now.
[03:18:11.007 --> 03:18:12.368]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[03:18:12.809 --> 03:18:15.111]  But this may be the clincher.
[03:18:15.151 --> 03:18:18.374]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[03:18:18.795 --> 03:18:18.935]  But
[03:18:19.395 --> 03:18:22.179]  We're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[03:18:22.639 --> 03:18:24.762]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[03:18:25.102 --> 03:18:26.484]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[03:18:26.825 --> 03:18:34.214]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[03:18:34.514 --> 03:18:37.918]  Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:18:38.499 --> 03:18:41.261]  You've got to experience what having the good halogen in your body does.
[03:18:41.721 --> 03:18:44.463]  Most folks, in about three weeks, go through a detoxification process.
[03:18:45.163 --> 03:18:49.666]  But what it does is for stamina, libido, focus, energy, it's really amazing.
[03:18:49.826 --> 03:18:56.850]  And if you don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[03:18:57.150 --> 03:18:59.271]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[03:18:59.632 --> 03:19:00.892]  It's available exclusively.
[03:19:01.173 --> 03:19:05.115]  Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:05.155 --> 03:19:06.456]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[03:19:07.543 --> 03:19:08.763]  That we can work this out.
[03:19:09.264 --> 03:19:15.986]  It's just right now we're kind of over a barrel, so I want listeners and viewers and everybody to know this stuff has a very, very long shelf life.
[03:19:16.346 --> 03:19:17.687]  I personally have stockpiled it.
[03:19:17.987 --> 03:19:22.609]  And your purchases fund the operation fighting for free speech, the Second Amendment, national sovereignty.
[03:19:22.849 --> 03:19:24.909]  So it is a true 360 win.
[03:19:25.169 --> 03:19:26.310]  Again, the term I coined.
[03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:29.653]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[03:19:29.993 --> 03:19:38.321]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[03:19:38.861 --> 03:19:43.185]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[03:19:43.626 --> 03:19:50.192]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:57.319 --> 03:20:01.903]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.774 --> 03:20:19.497]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:20:19.837 --> 03:20:24.040]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:29.541 --> 03:20:42.605]  Well, it's the policy of truth in that the reason they attack the Second Amendment is because they cannot have an armed population and a tyrannical government at the same time.
[03:20:43.405 --> 03:20:46.446]  Where I suggested, hey, why don't we consider
[03:20:47.316 --> 03:20:52.338]  Instead of bringing all of these refugees here, why don't we maybe try to organize them and reform their countries?
[03:20:53.058 --> 03:20:56.159]  Oh, they can't reform their countries because the government has all the guns.
[03:20:56.759 --> 03:20:59.240]  Now you see why the Second Amendment is so important.
[03:20:59.280 --> 03:21:00.681]  Now, we've got big news.
[03:21:01.201 --> 03:21:02.541]  Mueller and everything.
[03:21:02.581 --> 03:21:04.042]  It looks like it's finally coming apart.
[03:21:04.102 --> 03:21:05.382]  Charlie Rose gets sued.
[03:21:05.502 --> 03:21:08.143]  Unemployment numbers are even better than we expected.
[03:21:08.223 --> 03:21:13.965]  But Donald Trump is live at the NRA right now speaking, getting them fired up here in Dallas.
[03:21:14.265 --> 03:21:16.646]  So let's go to President Trump at the NRA convention.
[03:21:17.796 --> 03:21:23.119]  We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.
[03:21:23.760 --> 03:21:28.343]  And we all proudly stand for the National Anthem.
[03:21:28.443 --> 03:21:35.347]  We proudly stand.
[03:21:35.367 --> 03:21:36.108]  Powerful stuff here.
[03:21:37.909 --> 03:21:45.394]  As President Trump says we stand for the National Anthem, of course a direct shot at the professional athletes in this country who decide to take a knee
[03:21:48.396 --> 03:21:50.697]  I think that trend is going to die out this year.
[03:21:50.717 --> 03:21:53.998]  Yeah.
[03:21:54.838 --> 03:21:55.418]  Pop that up.
[03:21:55.438 --> 03:21:56.118]  Give me that loud.
[03:22:04.601 --> 03:22:05.281]  What people.
[03:22:05.421 --> 03:22:06.341]  What great people.
[03:22:07.802 --> 03:22:09.202]  And this is your record crowd.
[03:22:09.262 --> 03:22:11.023]  You know, all-time record crowd.
[03:22:11.063 --> 03:22:11.803]  You do know that.
[03:22:11.943 --> 03:22:13.164]  So, just remember.
[03:22:13.404 --> 03:22:14.244]  Nice and set record.
[03:22:15.299 --> 03:22:21.866]  And like I said earlier, I bet you that they have a record fundraising at this NRA convention as well.
[03:22:22.006 --> 03:22:26.490]  That shows them the same love and loyalty in return.
[03:22:27.491 --> 03:22:33.217]  For the last 15 months, that is exactly what we have been doing.
[03:22:33.998 --> 03:22:37.521]  We are all finally putting America first.
[03:22:42.853 --> 03:22:46.076]  Unless, of course, you're Robert Mueller, then you put the Deep State first, for the globalists.
[03:22:47.557 --> 03:22:49.959]  And we are seeing the incredible results.
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:58.246]  As a result of our massive tax cuts, and everybody is benefiting, and everybody is happy.
[03:22:59.567 --> 03:23:01.929]  And the Democrats are very concerned.
[03:23:01.969 --> 03:23:03.430]  You watch how well we do in 18.
[03:23:03.470 --> 03:23:03.970]  You watch.
[03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.531]  You watch.
[03:23:05.692 --> 03:23:07.293]  Get out and vote.
[03:23:07.573 --> 03:23:08.694]  Don't be complacent.
[03:23:09.475 --> 03:23:10.576]  Don't be complacent.
[03:23:12.718 --> 03:23:16.709]  You know, history says that when you win the presidency, you get complacent.
[03:23:17.170 --> 03:23:18.073]  We all know the feeling.
[03:23:18.093 --> 03:23:18.935]  Do you know the feeling?
[03:23:18.976 --> 03:23:19.537]  Not too many.
[03:23:21.826 --> 03:23:27.871]  Like 90% of the time, you win the presidency, and for whatever reason, you lose the midterm.
[03:23:28.472 --> 03:23:29.493]  We can't let that happen.
[03:23:29.893 --> 03:23:31.034]  And the word is complacent.
[03:23:31.134 --> 03:23:32.916]  I kept thinking to myself, why is that?
[03:23:32.976 --> 03:23:33.636]  I wonder why?
[03:23:34.257 --> 03:23:34.878]  Think about it.
[03:23:35.258 --> 03:23:37.940]  You win, you have this great win, now you take a breath.
[03:23:38.341 --> 03:23:38.981]  You relax.
[03:23:39.562 --> 03:23:44.466]  All of a sudden, two years is up, they're fighting like hell, and you're complacent.
[03:23:44.806 --> 03:23:46.608]  We cannot get complacent.
[03:23:46.848 --> 03:23:48.510]  We have to win the midterms.
[03:23:51.826 --> 03:23:52.547]  Yeah, it's key.
[03:23:53.688 --> 03:23:55.470]  And I don't think this blue wave is happening.
[03:23:55.690 --> 03:23:56.571]  I think it's totally bunk.
[03:23:57.572 --> 03:24:01.916]  We've created 3.2 million jobs.
[03:24:02.177 --> 03:24:02.917]  Unthought of.
[03:24:03.038 --> 03:24:10.585]  If we would have said that three years ago during the campaign, people would have said, what a horrible exaggeration.
[03:24:10.725 --> 03:24:11.766]  That's so terrible.
[03:24:11.806 --> 03:24:12.828]  They wouldn't have believed it.
[03:24:12.848 --> 03:24:13.368]  3.2 million.
[03:24:15.652 --> 03:24:26.576]  The unemployment rate, you saw that just today, just fell beneath 4% for the first time since the beginning of this century.
[03:24:28.216 --> 03:24:34.279]  And all it took was a president who wanted to make America first, a president who had America's interest at heart.
[03:24:34.579 --> 03:24:35.279]  That's all it took!
[03:24:35.699 --> 03:24:37.180]  Obama said it took a magic wand.
[03:24:37.480 --> 03:24:39.400]  Well, the magic wand was caring about America.
[03:24:39.861 --> 03:24:42.522]  The magic wand was not selling America down the drain.
[03:24:42.642 --> 03:24:43.542]  That was the magic wand.
[03:24:44.301 --> 03:24:46.623]  You know, I heard it was about 19 years.
[03:24:46.743 --> 03:24:47.783]  I said, wait a minute.
[03:24:48.564 --> 03:24:50.785]  The beginning of the century sounds better.
[03:24:51.346 --> 03:24:53.107]  So I say, the beginning of the century.
[03:24:56.769 --> 03:24:57.390]  More beautiful.
[03:24:59.271 --> 03:25:05.775]  African American unemployment has reached another all-time, in history, record low.
[03:25:05.936 --> 03:25:06.356]  In history.
[03:25:09.344 --> 03:25:13.666]  Uh-oh, and now Kanye West is saying that black people don't have to be Democrat.
[03:25:13.686 --> 03:25:15.948]  Oh, the Democrats are in panic mode.
[03:25:15.988 --> 03:25:25.112]  Kanye West must have some power, because you probably saw, I doubled my African-American poll numbers.
[03:25:25.292 --> 03:25:27.453]  We went from 11 to 22 in one week.
[03:25:27.494 --> 03:25:28.734]  Thank you, Kanye.
[03:25:28.874 --> 03:25:29.254]  Thank you.
[03:25:32.116 --> 03:25:33.697]  All the Democrats are so screwed.
[03:25:34.997 --> 03:25:35.998]  They're so screwed.
[03:25:38.044 --> 03:25:41.787]  And Nancy Pelosi thinks she's going to maintain her Speaker of the House position.
[03:25:41.807 --> 03:25:42.468]  Ha!
[03:25:44.409 --> 03:25:46.651]  Even the pollsters thought there must be a mistake.
[03:25:48.273 --> 03:25:49.594]  Now we've come a long way.
[03:25:50.114 --> 03:25:55.659]  You remember I'd come into big rooms, big audiences, and I'd say, what do you have to lose?
[03:25:55.859 --> 03:25:58.241]  Because the Democrats have always had that vote.
[03:25:58.381 --> 03:25:59.442]  I'd say, what do you have to lose?
[03:25:59.882 --> 03:26:00.723]  Horrible on crime.
[03:26:00.983 --> 03:26:02.144]  Horrible on education.
[03:26:02.224 --> 03:26:03.165]  Horrible on everything.
[03:26:03.225 --> 03:26:04.586]  I'd say, what do you have to lose?
[03:26:05.697 --> 03:26:14.156]  And they voted for me, and we won, but now the numbers are much higher than they ever were with African Americans, and we're happy.
[03:26:18.783 --> 03:26:26.407]  So now, because they're losing that vote, they're panicking and they're trying to get Mueller to start subpoenaing people.
[03:26:26.587 --> 03:26:29.949]  At the lowest level in history.
[03:26:30.629 --> 03:26:33.610]  Unemployment, lowest level in history.
[03:26:34.011 --> 03:26:41.735]  And women's unemployment, women, many women, is at the lowest level in almost 20 years.
[03:26:43.435 --> 03:26:43.996]  Think of that.
[03:26:44.736 --> 03:26:48.198]  So we have the best employment numbers we've virtually ever had.
[03:26:49.562 --> 03:26:54.186]  And yet, all we hear about is this phony Russia witch hunt.
[03:26:54.226 --> 03:26:59.590]  That's all we hear about.
[03:26:59.610 --> 03:27:09.277]  So, just when I'm walking on the stage, a highly respected judge in Virginia made statements.
[03:27:10.378 --> 03:27:16.603]  It says, Wall Street Journal, it says, Judge questions Mueller's authority to prosecute Manafort.
[03:27:20.919 --> 03:27:22.080]  Yes, shut it down.
[03:27:22.340 --> 03:27:27.362]  You know, he worked for me for a very short period of time, literally for like, what, a couple of months?
[03:27:28.283 --> 03:27:29.243]  Little period of time.
[03:27:29.683 --> 03:27:30.504]  Then what happens?
[03:27:31.364 --> 03:27:32.485]  He worked for Ronald Reagan.
[03:27:32.905 --> 03:27:33.985]  He worked for Bob Dole.
[03:27:34.526 --> 03:27:37.567]  They worked, I think, as a firm for John McCain.
[03:27:38.087 --> 03:27:39.008]  They worked for others.
[03:27:39.968 --> 03:27:41.029]  Does anybody say that?
[03:27:41.149 --> 03:27:41.389]  No.
[03:27:42.069 --> 03:27:45.671]  But he's out there fighting on fake news CNN.
[03:27:53.379 --> 03:27:55.945]  I think it may seem to be worse and worse.
[03:27:58.740 --> 03:28:01.782]  No, but on CNN, they have a headline.
[03:28:02.562 --> 03:28:07.185]  Judge in Manafort case says Mueller's aim is to hurt Trump.
[03:28:07.585 --> 03:28:08.106]  You believe that?
[03:28:08.446 --> 03:28:09.406]  This is what we're up against.
[03:28:09.466 --> 03:28:18.151]  Yeah, alright, so we're about to go to break here, and if you watched my live broadcast from the floor of the NRA convention, I was walking around, I was asking people, what do you think about the Mueller investigation?
[03:28:18.171 --> 03:28:20.473]  What do you think about the Russia-Trump collusion nonsense?
[03:28:21.013 --> 03:28:21.954]  Nobody believes it.
[03:28:22.434 --> 03:28:23.975]  They all think it's unconstitutional.
[03:28:24.655 --> 03:28:27.317]  And I think it's time for us to actually go a step further.
[03:28:27.817 --> 03:28:31.319]  We shouldn't be saying, hey, let's shut down the Mueller investigation.
[03:28:31.820 --> 03:28:34.341]  No, let's shut it down and then let's investigate him.
[03:28:35.422 --> 03:28:37.123]  Let's tap his phones.
[03:28:37.403 --> 03:28:39.385]  Let's investigate his bank account.
[03:28:39.685 --> 03:28:41.346]  Let's seize records from his attorneys.
[03:28:41.686 --> 03:28:43.647]  What do you think we would find on Robert Mueller?
[03:28:44.748 --> 03:28:46.149]  It's time to investigate Robert Mueller.
[03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:47.450]  That's what it's time for.
[03:28:47.470 --> 03:28:49.091]  And I think that's coming next, folks.
[03:28:49.131 --> 03:28:49.851]  All right, we'll be right back.
[03:28:49.871 --> 03:28:50.852]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.669 --> 03:29:01.332]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:02.232 --> 03:29:06.274]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:06.774 --> 03:29:09.135]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:09.915 --> 03:29:13.057]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:14.537 --> 03:29:18.739]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bones
[03:29:27.369 --> 03:29:42.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:43.443 --> 03:29:47.167]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:29:47.727 --> 03:29:49.429]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:49.469 --> 03:29:51.711]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:29:57.643 --> 03:30:09.486]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[03:30:10.126 --> 03:30:19.448]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[03:30:19.668 --> 03:30:24.469]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[03:30:24.989 --> 03:30:34.293]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[03:30:35.134 --> 03:30:39.876]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[03:30:39.896 --> 03:30:41.416]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[03:30:42.017 --> 03:30:48.340]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[03:30:48.360 --> 03:30:49.140]  Here's my problem.
[03:30:49.660 --> 03:30:58.085]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[03:30:58.486 --> 03:30:59.646]  I have the same issue.
[03:30:59.926 --> 03:31:00.086]  Yeah.
[03:31:00.707 --> 03:31:03.529]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[03:31:03.789 --> 03:31:05.290]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[03:31:06.290 --> 03:31:11.295]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[03:31:11.616 --> 03:31:13.758]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:31:13.798 --> 03:31:16.881]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[03:31:17.061 --> 03:31:20.605]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 per human in level.
[03:31:20.885 --> 03:31:22.306]  We went out with the top labs.
[03:31:22.487 --> 03:31:23.367]  We want the strongest.
[03:31:24.028 --> 03:31:30.414]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[03:31:30.434 --> 03:31:30.674]  This is key.
[03:31:30.694 --> 03:31:32.295]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[03:31:49.310 --> 03:31:52.291]  And you have inflammation of the brain, they call that something down the road.
[03:31:52.331 --> 03:31:54.792]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[03:31:55.192 --> 03:31:58.353]  You have inflammation of the cells, they call that something else down the road.
[03:31:58.373 --> 03:32:03.775]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say, it's inflammation in the brain.
[03:32:04.155 --> 03:32:06.836]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[03:32:06.956 --> 03:32:07.636]  That's exactly right.
[03:32:08.016 --> 03:32:10.497]  Now, your product is an extract.
[03:32:10.917 --> 03:32:13.618]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[03:32:13.858 --> 03:32:18.320]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[03:32:18.920 --> 03:32:22.123]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[03:32:22.463 --> 03:32:27.888]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[03:32:27.928 --> 03:32:29.589]  Well, that's another reason.
[03:32:29.649 --> 03:32:36.635]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[03:32:36.775 --> 03:32:37.195]  Exactly.
[03:32:37.335 --> 03:32:44.240]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[03:32:44.540 --> 03:32:49.063]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[03:32:57.268 --> 03:32:59.890]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.515 --> 03:33:17.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:18.162 --> 03:33:23.314]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:32.203 --> 03:33:34.424]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.504 --> 03:33:37.886]  Owen Troyer here hosting in the fourth hour live in Dallas, Texas.
[03:33:38.127 --> 03:33:40.908]  We were at the NRA convention earlier today.
[03:33:40.989 --> 03:33:44.131]  Myself, Jake Lloyd, Michael Zerman filing reports, doing live streams.
[03:33:44.551 --> 03:33:54.538]  We came back to the hotel to host the fourth hour of the Jones Show and then host the first hour of the War Room before we have a surprise special guest host taking over after the first hour.
[03:33:55.038 --> 03:33:56.639]  We're going to go back to President Trump in a minute.
[03:33:56.679 --> 03:34:00.120]  I want to open up the phone lines.
[03:34:00.140 --> 03:34:03.281]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:34:03.301 --> 03:34:04.061]  877-789-2539.
[03:34:05.502 --> 03:34:10.163]  Specifically, I only want to take calls on the Robert Mueller investigation.
[03:34:10.843 --> 03:34:12.304]  What do you think needs to be done about it?
[03:34:14.024 --> 03:34:16.085]  And what do you think is truly behind it?
[03:34:16.145 --> 03:34:21.467]  Now, I know that we've already talked about this at nauseam and we already have the answers, but we have to just
[03:34:22.259 --> 03:34:24.402]  Push this non-stop.
[03:34:24.662 --> 03:34:28.386]  We have to call out Robert Mueller 24-7, 365.
[03:34:30.869 --> 03:34:31.630]  Until he's done.
[03:34:32.711 --> 03:34:38.438]  Until justice befells those who are trying to remove and undermine a duly elected president.
[03:34:40.060 --> 03:34:41.782]  Because this is beyond
[03:34:44.881 --> 03:34:53.428]  I mean, you're talking about one individual, lawless, above the country, above the Constitution, above the separation of powers, above the executive branch.
[03:34:53.788 --> 03:34:54.228]  One man.
[03:34:55.109 --> 03:34:55.930]  Answers to no one.
[03:34:56.350 --> 03:34:56.890]  Unelected.
[03:34:57.511 --> 03:34:58.592]  Totally illegal.
[03:34:58.752 --> 03:35:00.093]  Investigate anybody you want.
[03:35:00.273 --> 03:35:01.414]  Try to find anything you want.
[03:35:01.874 --> 03:35:04.456]  The only goal is to try to bring Trump down.
[03:35:04.957 --> 03:35:06.018]  Destroy people's lives.
[03:35:06.178 --> 03:35:06.838]  Whatever you gotta do.
[03:35:06.878 --> 03:35:07.719]  Destroy the country.
[03:35:07.939 --> 03:35:08.860]  Anything you gotta do.
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:10.281]  Get Trump.
[03:35:11.013 --> 03:35:18.461]  And I guess it really shows you, I mean, I guess how clean Donald Trump actually is that the only thing they can find is some payment to a hooker or something.
[03:35:18.521 --> 03:35:19.722]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:35:20.743 --> 03:35:21.924]  So I'm going to take your calls on that.
[03:35:21.984 --> 03:35:23.466]  They're going to start gathering phone calls.
[03:35:24.491 --> 03:35:27.912]  But, ladies and gentlemen, this is all possible with your support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:35:28.372 --> 03:35:33.454]  We're able to have Cruz on the road, we've got Millie on the road, we've got myself, Jake Lloyd, Michael Zimmerman on the road.
[03:35:34.334 --> 03:35:39.056]  Big specials, the brand new DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com, 50% off right now.
[03:35:39.156 --> 03:35:45.378]  You know, I was down at the NRA convention, so many people come up to me and they plug our products, they love our products, they thank us for our products, folks.
[03:35:45.678 --> 03:35:48.159]  If you haven't tried the products yet, what are you waiting for?
[03:35:48.479 --> 03:35:52.120]  Give it a go, they're attacking us, they want to shut us down, we need your support now more than ever.
[03:35:52.700 --> 03:35:54.362]  They're going to come after us even harder now.
[03:35:54.402 --> 03:35:56.764]  This Mueller campaign is about to actually ramp up.
[03:35:57.324 --> 03:36:00.287]  And we're going to need even more funds to fight these legal battles, probably.
[03:36:00.347 --> 03:36:01.929]  But you have our word.
[03:36:01.949 --> 03:36:02.709]  We're going to expand.
[03:36:02.769 --> 03:36:05.011]  That's what your support at Infowarsstore.com does.
[03:36:05.031 --> 03:36:10.336]  So let's go back to President Trump for just a minute or two, guys, and then let me know when we got some calls aggregated.
[03:36:10.356 --> 03:36:12.218]  Here's President Trump at the NRA convention in Dallas.
[03:36:17.213 --> 03:36:21.256]  Can you imagine if we ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C.?
[03:36:21.376 --> 03:36:22.497]  There wouldn't be enough room.
[03:36:23.197 --> 03:36:24.318]  There wouldn't be enough room.
[03:36:25.159 --> 03:36:26.500]  We have a lot of love going on.
[03:36:26.540 --> 03:36:29.322]  You know, people don't realize we have great love going on in this country.
[03:36:29.642 --> 03:36:30.062]  Great love.
[03:36:30.683 --> 03:36:31.383]  It's right here.
[03:36:31.824 --> 03:36:35.586]  We have, and by the way, you just saw the recent poll.
[03:36:36.127 --> 03:36:38.128]  It came out the Rasmussen, 51 or 52.
[03:36:38.248 --> 03:36:40.830]  It's the highest level I've ever been at.
[03:36:41.090 --> 03:36:43.832]  How does that happen when you only get bad publicity?
[03:36:43.872 --> 03:36:44.573]  How does that happen?
[03:36:48.580 --> 03:36:57.583]  That's because people realize that a lot of what you read and a lot of what you see on television is fake.
[03:36:57.623 --> 03:36:58.263]  They realize it.
[03:36:58.303 --> 03:36:59.883]  The people realize it.
[03:36:59.924 --> 03:37:00.104]  Bingo.
[03:37:00.124 --> 03:37:02.404]  That is devastating right there from the mouth of the President.
[03:37:02.424 --> 03:37:04.945]  That is devastating to call out the establishment.
[03:37:04.965 --> 03:37:05.626]  Fake news.
[03:37:06.646 --> 03:37:10.787]  To keep your rights, and we're going to keep those rights, you're going to be so happy.
[03:37:10.827 --> 03:37:11.508]  You have to say it.
[03:37:12.288 --> 03:37:15.189]  You weren't sure that Trump was going to win, but you all went out there.
[03:37:16.471 --> 03:37:18.472]  You all went out there and you voted.
[03:37:19.413 --> 03:37:19.953]  You voted.
[03:37:25.276 --> 03:37:30.338]  And there were times that put up that Trump passed, Trump passed.
[03:37:30.678 --> 03:37:36.461]  There were times you're saying, a week before they were saying, I remember they came out with a lot of phony polls.
[03:37:37.842 --> 03:37:39.022]  You know what that's called?
[03:37:39.063 --> 03:37:39.583]  Suppression.
[03:37:40.933 --> 03:37:44.014]  They convince you that you're wasting your time.
[03:37:44.074 --> 03:37:44.795]  Why should you vote?
[03:37:44.835 --> 03:37:45.795]  Go to a movie instead.
[03:37:45.855 --> 03:37:47.116]  Come home, watch the results.
[03:37:47.696 --> 03:37:51.978]  Very few of the people in this room and in this country did that.
[03:37:52.958 --> 03:37:56.620]  And we really had a big night.
[03:37:56.640 --> 03:38:00.862]  Remember they said, there's no way elect will come.
[03:38:00.882 --> 03:38:01.282]  All right.
[03:38:01.462 --> 03:38:02.002]  All right.
[03:38:02.022 --> 03:38:02.702]  Pull Trump down.
[03:38:02.722 --> 03:38:05.343]  He's about to conclude this speech.
[03:38:05.403 --> 03:38:06.264]  This is actually canned.
[03:38:06.304 --> 03:38:07.845]  He already did conclude his speech.
[03:38:09.716 --> 03:38:10.277]  Very powerful.
[03:38:10.337 --> 03:38:11.698]  He got the NRA all fired up.
[03:38:11.758 --> 03:38:12.759]  Huge crowd at the NRA.
[03:38:12.819 --> 03:38:13.280]  Record crowd.
[03:38:13.300 --> 03:38:15.362]  They're gonna have record funds raised as well.
[03:38:15.442 --> 03:38:16.143]  I'm predicting that.
[03:38:16.223 --> 03:38:18.826]  That'll be reported probably in the news Monday.
[03:38:19.927 --> 03:38:25.873]  But he just hit an important point about voter suppression that they're trying to do again in the midterms.
[03:38:26.534 --> 03:38:27.675]  So they're doing the same thing.
[03:38:27.695 --> 03:38:29.157]  Oh, it's the blue wave.
[03:38:29.297 --> 03:38:30.979]  Oh, the Democrats have all the momentum.
[03:38:31.319 --> 03:38:31.680]  Bull!
[03:38:32.392 --> 03:38:35.014]  What momentum do the Democrats have other than the fake news?
[03:38:35.455 --> 03:38:45.784]  I did the analytics on the Senate races coming up, and I expect Republicans to probably get 54, maybe 56 seats in the Senate if it's that good.
[03:38:45.824 --> 03:38:50.148]  But I think 54, 53 is probably where it's going to end up favoring the Republicans.
[03:38:50.188 --> 03:38:56.774]  Of course, they'll tell you, you know, the Democrats will have 52 or something like that because they've, you know, they got to run their fake news voter suppression agenda.
[03:38:57.564 --> 03:38:58.745]  But I want to go to your phone calls, guys.
[03:38:58.765 --> 03:38:59.905]  Do we have anybody on the line yet?
[03:38:59.925 --> 03:39:01.026]  Just pipe into my ear.
[03:39:01.086 --> 03:39:01.586]  It's okay.
[03:39:01.846 --> 03:39:02.666]  Just pipe into my ear.
[03:39:02.706 --> 03:39:04.087]  Let me know what's going on with the phone lines.
[03:39:04.127 --> 03:39:10.890]  Because I was asking people today, I was asking people today, what do you think about the Mueller probe?
[03:39:11.050 --> 03:39:11.970]  What do you think needs to be done?
[03:39:12.730 --> 03:39:13.951]  People are sick of this, man.
[03:39:14.391 --> 03:39:16.552]  In fact, you know, I've got a guy that I met last night.
[03:39:17.886 --> 03:39:24.491]  A big liberal attorney here in Dallas, huge liberal attorney, has a lot of strings that he pulls to get liberal judges into office.
[03:39:24.611 --> 03:39:26.192]  We have totally different politics, but we got along.
[03:39:26.612 --> 03:39:29.274]  But even he is saying, like, look, this Russia thing is absurd.
[03:39:29.615 --> 03:39:30.375]  Trump's the president.
[03:39:30.455 --> 03:39:31.016]  Trump won.
[03:39:31.436 --> 03:39:34.218]  You know, OK, why is Mueller trying to destroy the country?
[03:39:34.938 --> 03:39:41.263]  So I just want to go to the callers and get your opinions on this, your angles on this, what you think needs to be happening with the Mueller investigation.
[03:39:41.283 --> 03:39:42.143]  Where do you think it goes from here?
[03:39:42.624 --> 03:39:44.345]  Did you say Ken in Dallas, guys?
[03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:46.741]  Kevin?
[03:39:47.181 --> 03:39:48.063]  Alright, Kevin, go ahead.
[03:39:48.083 --> 03:39:51.469]  Can you hear me?
[03:39:52.430 --> 03:39:52.791]  Yeah, Kevin.
[03:39:52.811 --> 03:39:55.636]  What do you think needs to be done to this Robert Mueller investigation?
[03:39:57.032 --> 03:39:59.995]  Okay, with this, I mean, this is just out of control.
[03:40:00.035 --> 03:40:16.689]  I mean, the fact that the whole investigation is based off of a phony dossier is just, it's insane, and that they keep, they're not reporting, the special counsel doesn't report to anyone when they're supposed to be reporting back, what is it, every six months to their higher-ups to make sure?
[03:40:17.492 --> 03:40:21.253]  You know, that they're not above the law, that they're not God, basically.
[03:40:21.293 --> 03:40:27.314]  I mean, and you have Mueller on this witch hunt for two years, spending millions of dollars, I mean, taxpayers' money.
[03:40:27.714 --> 03:40:33.375]  You got Jeff Sessions completely compromised, you know, and Rosenstein as well.
[03:40:33.435 --> 03:40:36.495]  I mean, it's unbelievable what we have going on right now.
[03:40:36.595 --> 03:40:39.756]  All the corruption, it's just insane what needs to happen.
[03:40:39.796 --> 03:40:45.497]  I mean, I understand, what I think is, I understand that people and their families are probably being threatened.
[03:40:46.683 --> 03:40:54.466]  That, you know, they really, right now, anybody in the White House is being threatened.
[03:40:54.726 --> 03:40:56.347]  And they're ruining people's lives, too.
[03:40:56.407 --> 03:40:57.548]  I mean, look at what's happening.
[03:40:57.828 --> 03:41:03.670]  Michael Caputo, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, even Alex Jones.
[03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:05.531]  I mean, they're ruining people's lives.
[03:41:06.231 --> 03:41:30.260]  I debate every day with my co-workers and colleagues, and I try to get in their heads that we're in a civil war with business suits and ties right now, and, you know, anybody who's going up against these neocons or the globalist puppets that have been in office for 30 years or more, you know, all these lifer politicians, these are the same people who led us into Iraq, these are the same people who, you know,
[03:41:30.700 --> 03:41:31.641]  We're good to go.
[03:41:45.973 --> 03:41:56.396]  I mean, I debate every single day to them, you know, with these... My coworkers are all very, you know, leftist, but I deal with it every day, and I get it through their heads, like, you know, the facts are there.
[03:41:56.816 --> 03:41:57.817]  These are the same people.
[03:41:57.877 --> 03:42:05.899]  These people are absolutely corrupt, and I mean, Loretta... No, see, that's the craziest part about it, though, is that there's people that actually believe it.
[03:42:05.939 --> 03:42:09.860]  I mean, that's the craziest thing to me, is that you have people that are so dumbed down
[03:42:10.535 --> 03:42:14.298]  They'll come up to me and they'll say, oh, you're going down for colluding with Russia.
[03:42:14.398 --> 03:42:15.959]  It's like, really, dude?
[03:42:16.259 --> 03:42:17.700]  Like, you're that stupid?
[03:42:18.381 --> 03:42:19.942]  But they actually believe this.
[03:42:20.202 --> 03:42:24.245]  And the longer this Mueller thing goes on, the longer their belief is going to maintain.
[03:42:25.086 --> 03:42:27.387]  That there's something there when there is nothing there.
[03:42:27.427 --> 03:42:28.308]  They have found nothing.
[03:42:28.348 --> 03:42:29.989]  If they did find anything, they would have leaked it.
[03:42:30.109 --> 03:42:42.656]  All they have is some payment to a damn hooker who gets more television time than a veteran that can't even get surgery because a VA hospital in Los Angeles can't even get itself cleaned up enough to perform a surgery.
[03:42:43.096 --> 03:42:47.099]  Oh, but let's let in another thousand illegal immigrants and let's focus on Stormy Daniels.
[03:42:47.119 --> 03:42:47.699]  Forget the veterans.
[03:42:48.099 --> 03:42:49.380]  Alright, more of your calls on the other side.
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:50.401]  Fourth Hour, Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:50.421 --> 03:42:50.921]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.165 --> 03:42:56.469]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:42:56.509 --> 03:42:58.251]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:42:58.672 --> 03:43:01.496]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:02.606 --> 03:43:13.658]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:14.099 --> 03:43:23.169]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:43:23.689 --> 03:43:29.255]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:43:29.476 --> 03:43:34.641]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:43:34.902 --> 03:43:36.884]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:37.184 --> 03:43:39.206]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:43:40.452 --> 03:43:43.276]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:43.476 --> 03:43:44.878]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:45.499 --> 03:43:48.063]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:43:48.824 --> 03:43:50.786]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:51.347 --> 03:43:53.611]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[03:43:54.468 --> 03:43:55.209]  I'm so excited.
[03:43:55.269 --> 03:44:04.835]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:44:05.435 --> 03:44:10.599]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:44:10.939 --> 03:44:13.741]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:44:13.941 --> 03:44:22.707]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:44:24.808 --> 03:44:29.610]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:44:30.130 --> 03:44:32.891]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:44:33.031 --> 03:44:43.915]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:44:44.415 --> 03:44:45.696]  It is amazing!
[03:44:47.096 --> 03:44:52.058]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:44:53.840 --> 03:45:05.389]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:06.369]  We're exposed to lead.
[03:45:06.409 --> 03:45:07.430]  We're exposed to mercury.
[03:45:07.470 --> 03:45:12.474]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[03:45:12.854 --> 03:45:17.858]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[03:45:17.958 --> 03:45:20.080]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:22.262]  Well, causes you to gain weight.
[03:45:22.382 --> 03:45:26.005]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[03:45:26.106 --> 03:45:31.110]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[03:45:31.471 --> 03:45:36.936]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[03:45:37.317 --> 03:45:42.542]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[03:45:42.882 --> 03:45:43.843]  And over and over again.
[03:45:43.903 --> 03:45:50.807]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[03:45:51.047 --> 03:45:53.228]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[03:45:53.328 --> 03:45:54.869]  I mean, this is so massive.
[03:45:54.949 --> 03:46:08.177]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[03:46:08.197 --> 03:46:08.918]  Fertility is key.
[03:46:09.458 --> 03:46:19.645]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually.
[03:46:19.685 --> 03:46:26.070]  The whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:30.473]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[03:46:30.513 --> 03:46:34.035]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[03:46:34.536 --> 03:46:35.937]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[03:46:36.397 --> 03:46:38.138]  Started losing weight, all this energy.
[03:46:38.158 --> 03:46:40.559]  I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[03:46:40.899 --> 03:46:45.361]  It's as important as vitamin C. You gotta have vitamin C. You gotta have iodine to live.
[03:46:45.381 --> 03:46:46.421]  You gotta have water to live.

[03:47:14.978 --> 03:47:18.901]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:19.341 --> 03:47:21.763]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:47:24.105 --> 03:47:31.010]  Well, Donald Trump just knocked it out of the park at the NRA convention in Dallas.
[03:47:31.170 --> 03:47:42.399]  He invoked, obviously, the Second Amendment, free speech, the nonsense of the Russian collusion probe, a total phony narrative to undermine the president and this country.
[03:47:43.573 --> 03:47:47.175]  Then he compares London, gun-free London, to a war zone.
[03:47:48.375 --> 03:47:50.777]  And Matt Drudge picks that up and runs with the headline, front page.
[03:47:51.757 --> 03:47:52.657]  Red-linked it, Drudge.
[03:47:53.238 --> 03:47:56.059]  Judge, question Mueller's power in Manafort.
[03:47:57.040 --> 03:48:00.001]  Case, basically saying they're lying.
[03:48:00.101 --> 03:48:02.282]  They're only, you know, trying to get rid of the President.
[03:48:02.302 --> 03:48:03.663]  There's nothing to this Russian thing.
[03:48:04.163 --> 03:48:05.364]  So it's really all coming down.
[03:48:05.484 --> 03:48:07.485]  I mean, it really is all coming down.
[03:48:08.065 --> 03:48:10.106]  Meanwhile, you've got all of the
[03:48:12.028 --> 03:48:15.670]  I'm not just trying to play partisan politics here, I'm just saying it how it is.
[03:48:16.150 --> 03:48:27.036]  All of these liberal show hosts, like Charlie Rose, I forget, there's like five of them now, that have like dozens of women accusing them of sexual assault.
[03:48:27.396 --> 03:48:28.957]  They're getting sued now.
[03:48:29.317 --> 03:48:34.460]  These are the same people that were reporting on Trump being a misogynist, on Trump abusing women.
[03:48:35.140 --> 03:48:36.501]  No, they're abusing women.
[03:48:37.182 --> 03:48:38.582]  They're colluding with Russia.
[03:48:39.042 --> 03:48:39.783]  That's them!
[03:48:40.672 --> 03:48:41.433]  They are the phonies.
[03:48:41.633 --> 03:48:42.554]  They are the liars.
[03:48:42.914 --> 03:48:44.035]  Yeah, Tom Brokaw.
[03:48:44.515 --> 03:48:46.317]  There's been like five of them now.
[03:48:47.417 --> 03:48:48.979]  So it's really all coming down.
[03:48:49.059 --> 03:48:57.185]  So the question then becomes, and I'm not addressing this to the audience, it's like, what do the globalists, what does the deep state do next in their final moments of panic?
[03:48:57.526 --> 03:48:59.347]  Do they launch a false flag?
[03:48:59.367 --> 03:49:00.748]  Do they release a bio weapon?
[03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:02.289]  Who knows what they're going to do?
[03:49:02.369 --> 03:49:04.992]  They are in their last legs right now.
[03:49:05.132 --> 03:49:05.592]  This is it.
[03:49:06.193 --> 03:49:07.514]  And I've been saying this for a week now.
[03:49:08.094 --> 03:49:09.015]  By the end of June,
[03:49:10.442 --> 03:49:11.103]  It's going down.
[03:49:11.483 --> 03:49:13.845]  Something big is going down by the end of June.
[03:49:14.305 --> 03:49:15.086]  I would predict that.
[03:49:15.146 --> 03:49:16.427]  Now, let's go back out to the phone lines.
[03:49:16.447 --> 03:49:18.289]  We've got James calling in from New York.
[03:49:18.329 --> 03:49:24.814]  My question today for the audience, what do you think is the what do we do with the Mueller investigation?
[03:49:25.175 --> 03:49:30.099]  And how do we not just shut it down, but then even investigate them?
[03:49:30.720 --> 03:49:33.222]  James, what do you think we need to do with the Mueller investigation?
[03:49:34.463 --> 03:49:35.404]  Hi, this is Owen Wright.
[03:49:36.625 --> 03:49:37.045]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:49:38.001 --> 03:49:38.441]  Great, okay.
[03:49:38.461 --> 03:49:39.563]  Yes, I'm in New York City.
[03:49:39.803 --> 03:49:40.443]  I'm a great fan.
[03:49:40.483 --> 03:49:41.484]  I'm a huge fan of you guys.
[03:49:42.305 --> 03:49:43.026]  I live in the Matrix.
[03:49:43.106 --> 03:49:44.287]  I mean, I'm writing The Battle of the Beasts.
[03:49:44.807 --> 03:49:45.648]  I work on Wall Street.
[03:49:45.668 --> 03:49:46.649]  I'm writing software.
[03:49:46.669 --> 03:49:50.453]  You know, I'm right in the middle of where the Rockefeller Center is.
[03:49:50.553 --> 03:49:56.899]  So with Mueller, everyone in New York, like the new shows in New York, write shows for New York only.
[03:49:56.999 --> 03:49:59.081]  They don't write shows for America.
[03:49:59.637 --> 03:50:09.465]  These people are locked in the Matrix, and when it comes to Mueller, Trump has to go out and continually go to these rallies and identify with the people.
[03:50:09.486 --> 03:50:13.529]  He has to force CBS, NBC, CNN to cover these guys.
[03:50:14.029 --> 03:50:20.014]  He needs to come out and he needs to say, you know what the Mueller investigation is, whatever it's going to be, however it's going to fall?
[03:50:20.395 --> 03:50:22.076]  Your vote didn't matter.
[03:50:22.917 --> 03:50:23.898]  These guys are thugs.
[03:50:24.514 --> 03:50:26.095]  Your vote doesn't matter.
[03:50:26.355 --> 03:50:32.019]  He needs to say this to the American people and say this investigation is a fraud.
[03:50:32.059 --> 03:50:40.245]  He already has more or less, James, but I think that you're kind of on to something else here that I've actually heard people call into Rush Limbaugh and suggest.
[03:50:40.725 --> 03:50:43.807]  I'm not sure if I don't know if we've ever suggested something like this.
[03:50:44.488 --> 03:50:46.029]  Trump, though, did mention it.
[03:50:46.069 --> 03:50:48.591]  He said, you know, what if we had a march in D.C.?
[03:50:48.611 --> 03:50:49.971]  What if we had a rally in D.C.?
[03:50:49.991 --> 03:50:50.972]  They'd shut down the whole city.
[03:50:51.513 --> 03:50:51.993]  No, no, no, no.
[03:50:53.109 --> 03:50:53.529]  Here's the thing.
[03:50:53.589 --> 03:50:54.630]  We don't organize.
[03:50:54.690 --> 03:50:55.611]  We don't do this crap.
[03:50:55.651 --> 03:50:56.411]  We don't protest.
[03:50:56.511 --> 03:50:57.332]  We got better things to do.
[03:50:57.372 --> 03:50:58.012]  We have lives.
[03:50:58.133 --> 03:50:58.373]  Alright?
[03:50:58.473 --> 03:51:01.275]  And we're not a bunch of wine bags that complain when things don't go our way.
[03:51:01.475 --> 03:51:01.735]  Okay?
[03:51:01.755 --> 03:51:02.896]  We go on with our lives.
[03:51:02.996 --> 03:51:04.937]  So protesting and marching isn't really something we do.
[03:51:04.957 --> 03:51:06.638]  We have the pro-life march that gets millions of people.
[03:51:06.658 --> 03:51:07.299]  But imagine!
[03:51:08.179 --> 03:51:09.560]  And Trump could actually do this.
[03:51:10.841 --> 03:51:13.063]  Now, I don't expect this Mueller thing to last past June.
[03:51:13.303 --> 03:51:18.266]  I really think everything in June is about to just blow up and we're gonna really see what's going on here.
[03:51:18.947 --> 03:51:20.548]  But if it continues to go on,
[03:51:21.946 --> 03:51:27.393]  Imagine if Donald Trump says, okay, we're going to set a date and we're going to march in DC.
[03:51:28.544 --> 03:51:30.304]  All of my supporters, we're gonna march in D.C.
[03:51:30.404 --> 03:51:41.166]  against Mueller, against the Deep State, against the attacks on free speech, against the attacks on the Second Amendment, all together, just all the conservatives, all the Trump supporters, coming together at one time, just to say, you know what?
[03:51:41.586 --> 03:51:50.208]  You have your phony women marches, your phony student marches, propped up by George Soros and all these leftist organizations, funding millions of dollars to bust you guys in.
[03:51:50.608 --> 03:51:55.489]  We can do that too, and we can be bigger, and we can be louder, and we also get political change through.
[03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:57.569]  I don't know if that's something that's going to happen.
[03:51:57.589 --> 03:52:01.330]  It might be too late now, because like I said, I think it's all coming down by the end of June.
[03:52:01.350 --> 03:52:02.411]  Thank you for the call, James.
[03:52:03.031 --> 03:52:06.152]  Let's jump to Branson, Missouri, where Eugene is calling in.
[03:52:06.212 --> 03:52:08.993]  Eugene, what do you think we need to do about this Mueller investigation?
[03:52:09.953 --> 03:52:10.433]  Hey, Owen.
[03:52:10.673 --> 03:52:14.374]  This is Eugene Roundtree, High Voltage News, and I love the work you guys are doing.
[03:52:14.394 --> 03:52:17.135]  Trey Gowdy and others have said this.
[03:52:17.828 --> 03:52:20.710]  It's all up to the executive branch, the DOJ.
[03:52:21.171 --> 03:52:22.532]  The Congress can only do so much.
[03:52:22.592 --> 03:52:24.633]  They can only investigate and do things like that.
[03:52:24.673 --> 03:52:27.776]  Yeah, there's no, there's prosecute, there's no prosecute, uh, prosecute.
[03:52:27.876 --> 03:52:28.496]  I can't even say the word.
[03:52:28.516 --> 03:52:29.857]  They can't prosecute in Congress.
[03:52:30.718 --> 03:52:31.499]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:52:31.939 --> 03:52:34.561]  And so I think all of us have been quite patient.
[03:52:34.661 --> 03:52:37.303]  Horowitz has his, uh, study that he's doing.
[03:52:37.323 --> 03:52:38.284]  That'll come out soon.
[03:52:38.304 --> 03:52:44.749]  And I think June, like you said, is going to be a good, uh, landstone, but it's all up to them.
[03:52:45.898 --> 03:52:47.219]  They needed a little bit of time.
[03:52:47.559 --> 03:52:49.961]  They came into a government that's been decades corrupt.
[03:52:50.381 --> 03:52:52.443]  They need to figure out who the bad actors were.
[03:52:52.683 --> 03:52:54.664]  Okay, we've given them enough time for that.
[03:52:55.144 --> 03:53:02.969]  But if they wait too much longer, be it politics or waiting for the perfect timing, I don't know how it's going to pan out.
[03:53:03.049 --> 03:53:08.813]  But at some point, they need to pull the trigger on getting out the corruptness that's in the government.
[03:53:08.893 --> 03:53:10.394]  And I know it's a huge spiderweb.
[03:53:10.574 --> 03:53:11.575]  You know it's true as well.
[03:53:12.418 --> 03:53:14.420]  Oh yeah, and we're at the apex right now.
[03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:17.002]  If you want to, you know, start to kind of throw things around.
[03:53:17.502 --> 03:53:21.566]  If this is a cold civil war that we're in right now, which I mean it essentially is.
[03:53:23.277 --> 03:53:25.118]  They have, I mean, you're right.
[03:53:25.238 --> 03:53:26.499]  It's time to do something now.
[03:53:26.519 --> 03:53:27.880]  And that's why I think it's going to happen soon.
[03:53:28.020 --> 03:53:29.921]  But this cannot go on any longer.
[03:53:30.081 --> 03:53:31.502]  They are destroying this country.
[03:53:31.742 --> 03:53:32.902]  They're dividing this nation.
[03:53:33.002 --> 03:53:37.024]  The news has gone so, so whacked out 1984.
[03:53:37.885 --> 03:53:40.766]  Now they're saying that Alex Jones documentary shouldn't even be on the internet.
[03:53:40.786 --> 03:53:42.868]  That's like, you know, Brooke burning essentially.
[03:53:42.928 --> 03:53:44.128]  So it's out of hand.
[03:53:44.148 --> 03:53:46.850]  I mean, something, if we don't stop this, it's only going to get worse.
[03:53:47.650 --> 03:53:50.872]  And that's, that's what my biggest fear is, is what does that mean?
[03:53:51.455 --> 03:53:52.888]  What is worse than...
[03:53:53.917 --> 03:54:05.565]  An unelected investigation, totally lawless, totally above the country, above the Republic, above the Constitution, and then you have the fake news that props it up, and then they get all their minions funded by George Soros in the streets.
[03:54:05.585 --> 03:54:06.966]  I mean, what's next?
[03:54:07.386 --> 03:54:12.790]  I mean, these people will go to the next level to maintain their corrupt establishment.
[03:54:12.970 --> 03:54:20.655]  I think that they've made that clear, so if Trump or we the people don't pull the trigger on these criminals soon, it's just gonna get worse.
[03:54:20.715 --> 03:54:22.216]  Thank you for the call, Eugene.
[03:54:22.236 --> 03:54:23.397]  Let's jump out to Oklahoma.
[03:54:24.817 --> 03:54:25.318]  Go ahead, Bob.
[03:54:25.338 --> 03:54:27.278]  What do you think we need to do about this Mueller investigation?
[03:54:28.179 --> 03:54:28.799]  Hi, Owen.
[03:54:28.839 --> 03:54:29.619]  How are you today?
[03:54:31.260 --> 03:54:32.681]  You seem to be on fire.
[03:54:34.641 --> 03:54:36.042]  Am I smoking right now?
[03:54:36.662 --> 03:54:38.203]  Yeah, you're smoking, man.
[03:54:38.583 --> 03:54:40.844]  Huh?
[03:54:42.384 --> 03:54:42.885]  Go ahead.
[03:54:43.925 --> 03:54:44.265]  I'm sorry.
[03:54:44.845 --> 03:54:51.108]  Anyway, first I just wanted to say that I'm really proud of you for being a fighter for liberty.
[03:54:51.813 --> 03:54:54.675]  And Alex, I've been a listener for 20 years.
[03:54:55.235 --> 03:54:56.837]  I'm 61 years old.
[03:54:57.397 --> 03:55:00.679]  My name's Liberty Smith on Gab if you want to check me out.
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:05.603]  That being said, I agree with Mr. Corsi, Dr. Corsi.
[03:55:06.603 --> 03:55:14.309]  He needs, Trump needs to fire Rosenstein, Mueller, and Sessions right now.
[03:55:14.969 --> 03:55:17.791]  Take the hit right now because they're not going to stop.
[03:55:17.931 --> 03:55:19.072]  We already know this.
[03:55:19.961 --> 03:55:23.323]  It's really frustrating to us here out in flyover country.
[03:55:23.363 --> 03:55:25.304]  You know, I work week to week.
[03:55:25.324 --> 03:55:27.145]  I'm an independent contractor.
[03:55:27.786 --> 03:55:30.867]  I see and I listen to all this crud.
[03:55:31.027 --> 03:55:32.568]  Nothing ever gets done.
[03:55:32.588 --> 03:55:36.311]  So now that's what, that's what Mr. Trump can do.
[03:55:36.371 --> 03:55:37.851]  That's what our president can do.
[03:55:37.871 --> 03:55:38.952]  That's it.
[03:55:38.972 --> 03:55:39.432]  Exactly.
[03:55:39.492 --> 03:55:40.593]  No, that's, that's it.
[03:55:40.713 --> 03:55:41.373]  Exactly.
[03:55:42.074 --> 03:55:45.616]  Is that we felt that Trump was our last hope.
[03:55:46.235 --> 03:55:56.600]  To actually have a real country that's not run by a bunch of corrupt globalists and there isn't a deep state establishment that has their own agenda outside of the agenda of the United States of America and her people.
[03:55:57.741 --> 03:55:58.361]  But that's it!
[03:55:59.753 --> 03:56:02.016]  I don't know if firing Sessions is the answer.
[03:56:02.076 --> 03:56:04.319]  I don't know if firing Rosenstein is the answer.
[03:56:04.559 --> 03:56:06.962]  I would actually say I'd lock someone up.
[03:56:07.443 --> 03:56:08.144]  That's what I'd do.
[03:56:08.304 --> 03:56:12.009]  I would straight up throw someone's ass in jail and I'd say, you know what?
[03:56:12.049 --> 03:56:12.710]  We've got you.
[03:56:12.770 --> 03:56:14.932]  We know you broke the law, you SOB.
[03:56:15.273 --> 03:56:16.554]  You're getting locked up.
[03:56:16.595 --> 03:56:17.055]  But you know what?
[03:56:17.115 --> 03:56:17.616]  I'll tell you what.
[03:56:18.254 --> 03:56:35.572]  If you want to sing about why they said that they need to have an insurance plan for President Trump, if you want to sing about why Hillary Clinton was colluding with the media to get questions, if you want to sing about all the other corruption that was uncovered in the WikiLeaks, who knows, maybe you attended a spirit cooking or two, if you want to sing about that,
[03:56:36.392 --> 03:56:39.853]  Maybe we can make a deal and you don't have to spend the rest of your life in jail.
[03:56:40.113 --> 03:56:48.596]  Otherwise, you're going to rot away in this prison cell and all the people that you colluded with to try to bring this country down, well, they're not going to help you because they don't give a damn about you.
[03:56:49.116 --> 03:56:50.977]  So I think that you're on to something there, Bob.
[03:56:51.017 --> 03:56:52.617]  Thank you so much for the kind words and your support.
[03:56:52.657 --> 03:56:55.098]  I want to get a quick word from Dr. Kelly in California.
[03:56:55.618 --> 03:56:57.139]  You've got 40 seconds, Dr. Kelly.
[03:56:57.159 --> 03:56:57.559]  Make it quick.
[03:56:58.172 --> 03:56:58.913]  Awesome, thank you.
[03:56:59.053 --> 03:57:04.976]  Everyone needs to go and apply at your state capitol for a position on your federal grand jury.
[03:57:05.457 --> 03:57:12.601]  Complain to or get on to your county grand juries and let's have a grand jury reawakening.
[03:57:12.621 --> 03:57:18.985]  There is a profile for Robert Swan Muller at the California Bar website.
[03:57:19.326 --> 03:57:22.347]  They are foreign agents not registered with FARA.gov
[03:57:23.729 --> 03:57:25.671]  Well, you know what?
[03:57:25.711 --> 03:57:31.077]  That's actually interesting because California bar registration and laws are different than the rest of the country.
[03:57:31.477 --> 03:57:31.657]  Huh!
[03:57:31.998 --> 03:57:33.880]  So I wonder if that has something to do with that.
[03:57:34.621 --> 03:57:36.623]  Robert Mueller should not just be disbarred.
[03:57:36.903 --> 03:57:38.946]  The guy should be behind bars!
[03:57:39.366 --> 03:57:40.507]  That does it for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:40.547 --> 03:57:41.028]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[03:57:41.048 --> 03:57:42.069]  I pick up the war room next.
[03:57:42.089 --> 03:57:42.630]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:45.880]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:57:46.281 --> 03:57:51.421]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:57:52.102 --> 03:57:55.022]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:57:55.462 --> 03:57:58.983]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[03:57:59.603 --> 03:58:10.845]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:58:11.505 --> 03:58:22.255]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[03:58:22.555 --> 03:58:28.000]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[03:58:28.321 --> 03:58:31.604]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[03:58:32.144 --> 03:58:33.586]  It's a 360 win.
[03:58:33.946 --> 03:58:37.069]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[03:58:37.429 --> 03:58:39.211]  You're helping to fight for freedom.
[03:58:39.512 --> 03:58:40.893]  So please go to the site now.
[03:58:41.314 --> 03:58:42.936]  We need your support.
[03:58:43.436 --> 03:58:47.020]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[03:58:47.301 --> 03:58:48.602]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[03:58:48.642 --> 03:58:50.344]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[03:58:50.604 --> 03:58:53.007]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[03:58:53.047 --> 03:58:53.988]  We've beaten six.
[03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:56.231]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[03:58:56.932 --> 03:58:57.653]  You're my soldier.
[03:58:57.693 --> 03:58:58.454]  We're all in this together.
[03:58:59.495 --> 03:58:59.735]  And we're
