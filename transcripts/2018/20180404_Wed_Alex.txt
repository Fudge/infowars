[00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:11.639]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.221]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:34.347]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:49.290]  Well, CBS News, ABC News and others are now reporting word for word what we broke here in 2013 and 2014 with absolute, total precision.
[00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:57.937]  Because we had a source inside, I'm not going to say state, federal or local government, in Washington and Oregon.
[00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:07.684]  Word for word, here it is today, the AP, Rogue Network of Cellular Eavesdropping Devices, discovered throughout Washington, D.C.
[00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:13.606]  Well, we expose it in Washington State, Washington, D.C., Texas, you name it.
[00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:22.810]  The devices can be mounted in vehicles, drones, helicopters, and airplanes, stingray systems, and we lay out exactly how it operates, and then they now admit the operation.
[00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.030]  Now, here we are from 2013.
[00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:33.986]  Merkel Thelen, our technology writer, exclusive government documents revealed DHS domestic spy takeover.
[00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.309]  Gets into all the towers, all the stingrays.
[00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.030]  Boom.
[00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:40.716]  So, the news of four years from now, today.
[00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:42.659]  Or five years from now, today.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.601]  November 12, 2013.
[00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:46.622]  Let's just continue.
[00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:47.242]  Here's another one.
[00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:48.903]  Exclusive.
[00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.945]  Mystery of rogue cell towers discovered.
[00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:54.066]  Feds attempt to downplay growing spy grid.
[00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:55.207]  Say it doesn't exist.
[00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:55.947]  Merkel Thelen.
[00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.448]  Infowars.com.
[00:01:57.488 --> 00:01:57.989]  September 2014.
[00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.131]  Here's another one.
[00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:01.931]  Prison planet.
[00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:02.651]  Merkel Thelen.
[00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.212]  November 2014.
[00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:08.375]  Police deny responsibility for stingray cell phone tracker discovered in Idaho.
[00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:14.248]  Tech firm, more than 15 Stingray phone trackers operated in D.C.
[00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:14.248]  2014.
[00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:17.371]  Oh, but AP just broke it.
[00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:19.674]  Just taking our story and republishing it.
[00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:20.315]  Today.
[00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:21.596]  Today.
[00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:23.158]  Today.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.921]  Total plagiarism.
[00:02:26.962 --> 00:02:28.144]  Four years later.
[00:02:29.807 --> 00:02:33.390]  Tech firm, and I'm not accusing the journalists themselves of that, but the story itself.
[00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.532]  That's why they hate us, because we break it all.
[00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:38.814]  Everybody else has got this information.
[00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:40.635]  They're on one-inch leashes.
[00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:41.896]  We're not on a leash.
[00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:43.278]  We're off the chain.
[00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:49.362]  Yes, InfoWars is the most hated media, multimedia operation in the world.
[00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.344]  Drudge is the most hated news site in the world.
[00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:53.806]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:57.629]  We are victory because of you, but we are under massive attack.
[00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:06.306]  Make no mistake that we're bringing the country and the world back into the light, but those of us at the front lines are always engaging the enemy strongholds.
[00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:07.447]  So we're in the dark.
[00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:08.608]  We're in the storm.
[00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:14.777]  And your support, your prayers, your financial support, you spreading the articles and videos and telling people about the show?
[00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:18.299]  That is the lighthouse in the distance we're going towards.
[00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.980]  But we're engaging the enemy at point-blank range.
[00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:22.081]  And they know it.
[00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:22.821]  Continuing.
[00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:26.783]  Tech firm, more than 50 Stingray phone trackers operated in D.C.
[00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:29.264]  Raquel Phelan, where's his Pulitzer Prize?
[00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:31.005]  Where's his Pulitzer Prize?
[00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.047]  He's broken thousands of stories.
[00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:36.928]  Drugs Report, by the way, was the only outlet to link to us then.
[00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:38.269]  Sacramento Sheriff,
[00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:41.199]  Confronted over stingray surveillance.
[00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.920]  Raquel Phelan, 2014.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.383]  You know, that's our problem, though.
[00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:53.132]  We break stuff... We break stuff so long before people that after we already know, stuff will break like this in mainstream media.
[00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:54.774]  And people go, oh, why aren't you covering the stingray?
[00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:55.175]  And I'm like...
[00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.671]  Been covering Stingray for 10 years, sweetheart.
[00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:01.872]  Broke exactly how the whole thing operates in the last 5 years.
[00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:02.852]  Exclusively.
[00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:04.133]  With the actual documents.
[00:04:04.393 --> 00:04:06.693]  How federal, state, and local all integrate together.
[00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:07.514]  It's totally illegal.
[00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:09.594]  And it's not even used to stop criminals, by the way.
[00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:13.756]  So, I mean, there's the documents right there if you'd like to read all about it.
[00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:16.877]  I mean, we just have the actual diagrams of the Death Star.
[00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:19.057]  It's not like we're APs telling you about it now.
[00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:23.719]  I mean, we get the diagrams of the Death Star, we blow it up, and then we're the enemy.
[00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:34.343]  And all these followers and all these cowards sit there and go, well, I'm a patriot, I'm a libertarian, but you know, Jones is a little extreme for me, thinking you're gonna sit in the middle of the road and be safe.
[00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.444]  That's where the dead road kills it.
[00:04:37.265 --> 00:04:38.406]  I am on the vanguard.
[00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:39.907]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:41.248]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:44.330]  We are going in, through, and beyond, and I love it!
[00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.291]  I wouldn't do it any other way.
[00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:50.513]  I thank God for this position, and I thank God that we're the tip of the spear.
[00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:56.596]  And that's why we're being persecuted and attacked, because we are hurting the globalists, and we will go on hurting them until the end.
[00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:00.058]  I am 1,000% committed, and I love what's happening!
[00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:00.679]  Yes!
[00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.439]  Victory!
[00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:02.079]  Victory!
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.680]  Victory!
[00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:12.650]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.957]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:25.802]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:32.706]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:39.870]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.771]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:46.834]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:51.336]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.678]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:05:54.858 --> 00:06:01.000]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.860]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:28.352]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.503]  It's 4-4, Wednesday, April 4th, 2018.
[00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:42.604]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:42.904]  I am
[00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:49.560]  I'm going to be traveling to Washington, D.C.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.625]  next week, and I'm going to have a press conference on a whole bunch of really, really important issues.
[00:06:56.826 --> 00:06:58.167]  So that is coming up.
[00:06:58.187 --> 00:06:59.769]  Will you guys print me that press release again?
[00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:01.550]  I had it here, but I can't find the stack.
[00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:11.460]  I'm going to cover that at the bottom of the hour, give you a first look at some of the things we're going to do to fight the Democrats and Soros and their attempts to overturn
[00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:15.423]  The First Amendment, which is now admitted.
[00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:18.125]  And of course, it's in mainline UK news.
[00:07:18.145 --> 00:07:19.866]  There's no more free speech in the UK.
[00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:21.827]  There's no more free speech in Europe.
[00:07:22.247 --> 00:07:25.529]  I mean, the governments are saying that there's no more free speech.
[00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.113]  But the people themselves, they need to just exercise it.
[00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:32.454]  And that's how you respond.
[00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:34.575]  You hang up flyers all over the town at night.
[00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:39.899]  If you're in a city or country where they've banned your free speech, you spray paint the water tower.
[00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.481]  I mean, this is information warfare.
[00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.262]  This is French Resistance type stuff.
[00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:47.323]  We are entering into that quadrant.
[00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:52.205]  And so we need to be non-violent, but gloves need to come off.
[00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:56.607]  Now is the time for Libertarians, Christians, and Conservatives to get aggressive.
[00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:01.870]  Google has banned Easter.
[00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.471]  They're delisting it.
[00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:05.071]  They didn't do a doodle for it.
[00:08:05.992 --> 00:08:10.194]  They're banning anything pro-America, anything free market, anything pro-military.
[00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:18.783]  Anything pro-Christian, Apple's doing the same thing, banning Easter, Office Calendar, celebrating Islam and Hinduism and everything else.
[00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:20.426]  It's incredible.
[00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:25.533]  We're going to cover the latest developments with this liberal
[00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:36.558]  Yoga teacher, bunny worshipper, Iranian liberal, who was mad that her videos were getting demonetized.
[00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:40.819]  And YouTube is demonetizing, as I said, everybody but establishment stuff.
[00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:45.480]  The left at first was like, yay, last few years, censor conservatives, screw them over!
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:53.082]  And then now, almost everyone's being censored but a few handful, maybe a hundred leftist talk shows.
[00:08:54.127 --> 00:09:01.332]  Who then get force-fed to everybody and pushed out because they're anti-American, and then they still are monetized, but they'll be removed as well.
[00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:05.655]  So, this is the process of how censorship works.
[00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.897]  The globalists don't want anybody having free speech.
[00:09:07.937 --> 00:09:13.701]  Pelosi, Libs immediately politicize YouTube shooting to push gun control.
[00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:19.063]  YouTube shooter said witness I didn't have a gun but I wish I did.
[00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:20.004]  That video is coming up.
[00:09:20.364 --> 00:09:30.587]  Suspect in YouTube shooting posted rants about the company and of course her father and family warned that they thought she was coming to kill people but nothing was done as usual.
[00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:34.008]  The San Jose Mercury News and others are reporting that.
[00:09:34.468 --> 00:09:42.231]  YouTube shooter Nassim Ogdom's father says he called the police concerned about her anger at the company.
[00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:59.702]  Shooter hated YouTube, Iranian animal rights protester 39, well that was the one she got to watch, who shot three staff at video giant HQ before killing herself, her vendetta against dictatorial site for censoring her videos and not paying her.
[00:10:00.903 --> 00:10:02.903]  And she looks like a complete whack job.
[00:10:02.943 --> 00:10:03.864]  I mean, just put her on screen.
[00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:09.746]  I think it's terrible what happened at YouTube and terrible that happened to the employees of Google.
[00:10:11.397 --> 00:10:16.960]  But this is what happens, as Kennedy said, what was his famous quote?
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:24.444]  Those that make peaceful elections impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:29.606]  And just, the woman looks like a complete whack job, look at her.
[00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:36.010]  And she's definitely getting attention for her yoga videos now.
[00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:47.291]  But you know, you take artists, and you take their material, and then you use them to build your organization up, YouTube, meaning the people, and then you censor it, and I've seen the videos.
[00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:48.732]  This is not censorable stuff.
[00:10:50.453 --> 00:10:54.515]  But they don't want... Let's put some of this on screen.
[00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:55.716]  This is what they censored.
[00:10:57.117 --> 00:11:02.740]  Is her doing yoga exercises, and basic stretching exercises, and...
[00:11:04.574 --> 00:11:06.216]  NassimABC.com.
[00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:09.059]  NassimSABZ.com.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.700]  You can go there.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.341]  We've gone and looked.
[00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:13.363]  I mean, there's just nothing there to censor.
[00:11:13.383 --> 00:11:15.545]  And it's terrible that she shot three people.
[00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:22.573]  Again, the media is calling bizarre Instagram videos of animal rights activists behind YouTube gun rampage.
[00:11:22.993 --> 00:11:24.214]  We're going to play some of that.
[00:11:27.964 --> 00:11:29.005]  She looks like a man.
[00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:34.587]  When I first saw the pictures yesterday, I thought, you know, is this a transgender person?
[00:11:34.607 --> 00:11:35.568]  But I guess it is a woman.
[00:11:36.468 --> 00:11:41.731]  So YouTube finally says employees can talk publicly about the shooting.
[00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:42.932]  They also gagged them.
[00:11:44.092 --> 00:11:47.274]  Silicon Valley grapples with security risk after YouTube shooting.
[00:11:49.326 --> 00:12:03.916]  You know, the big issue here is, and I have a stack of articles on that that we'll be getting to, is particularly Twitter, but also Facebook, Google hasn't been as bad that we know of, they're bad many other ways, have been helping Pakistan and others target people that say...
[00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:10.401]  That Allah isn't God, or Mohammed isn't his prophet, they call that blasphemy, and they come and they arrest you and they kill you.
[00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:15.005]  I've got the articles right here, and Twitter and Facebook and others have been involved in that.
[00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:26.175]  So, how does it feel, though, for the tech giants to say they're worried about people coming to get them for what they say and do, when you're helping people, including Communist China, round up political dissidents?
[00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:28.036]  And that's come out with Apple in the news.
[00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:40.125]  That Apple and others are now working with China to help target their dissidents and Apple's moving its headquarters to China as you let the government inside of there to track everything and have the keys to your cloud internet with them.
[00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:47.910]  Because they say, well, if we're going to be based here to get tax exemption, that's how China countered Trump equalizing corporate taxes with China from 40 to 15 percent.
[00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.632]  They just said, we're going to zero, but you got to come here and be state run.
[00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.295]  And Apple said, we're basically already in China, we're state run.
[00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:57.195]  And so here's the big news.
[00:12:57.655 --> 00:12:59.576]  Drumroll please, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:00.737 --> 00:13:02.578]  The story is on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:02.718 --> 00:13:07.100]  I can confirm from Jerome Corsi's sources and my other sources in the White House.
[00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:27.732]  I was told months ago that he's been talking to Peter Thiel, and that he's been talking to other folks like Elon Musk, and that they are developing a plan with his new 2020 campaign head, who was just their tech head, who's a great guy as well, I'm told, to go after leftist monopolies in the internet, which is Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[00:13:28.612 --> 00:13:31.694]  The Axios thing that Trump loves Facebook is not true.
[00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:37.959]  He does say, oh, you know, if other people are getting censored, that's a problem, but at least I'll break through it.
[00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:38.839]  That's what he says.
[00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:39.780]  He goes, they don't censor me.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:47.806]  But he's now learning that all these channels that amplify him and the channels that carry his speeches are being banned on Facebook.
[00:13:47.866 --> 00:13:48.966]  He is getting briefed.
[00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:55.251]  Let me just tell Facebook, he's been briefed face to face by three people I know in the last month.
[00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.153]  That he is being turned down.
[00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:03.217]  His volume from 11, aka spinal tap, down to about a 1 or maybe a .5.
[00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.999]  It's less than 10% of what it was.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.762]  Ahead of the midterms, they're dialing everybody back.
[00:14:09.142 --> 00:14:12.385]  Congresswomen running for Congress, again, you know, been banned.
[00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:17.229]  People running for Congress are having their very milquetoast videos banned on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:19.311]  They're not letting them share them.
[00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.032]  They're banning them.
[00:14:21.155 --> 00:14:26.697]  So the good news is report Trump to host Peter Thiel to talk regulation of big tech.
[00:14:27.337 --> 00:14:29.538]  And so that is the big enchilada.
[00:14:30.038 --> 00:14:31.099]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:32.399]  We're also going to be looking at study.
[00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:36.461]  Getting on Facebook for just five days reduces stress levels.
[00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.481]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:39.302]  Makes kids nervous, makes them all panic.
[00:14:39.662 --> 00:14:43.764]  They've got to be talking to their friends and getting constant messages that don't mean anything.
[00:14:44.924 --> 00:14:46.847]  It just lowers the attention span even more.
[00:14:46.907 --> 00:14:50.331]  It's meant to fry your dopamine levels and completely enslave you.
[00:14:50.351 --> 00:15:00.044]  In the words of Facebook executives and Twitter executives, Islamic groups report Indonesian politicians for reciting blasphemous poems.
[00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:02.106]  That's the president's daughter.
[00:15:02.127 --> 00:15:02.948]  They want her arrested.
[00:15:04.315 --> 00:15:08.778]  Lawsuit prescribes pervasively hostile anti-Jewish atmosphere in San Francisco State.
[00:15:08.898 --> 00:15:09.579]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:15.282]  That's the new leftist thing, is being anti-Semitic, because they've fully embraced the doctrine of radical Islam.
[00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:23.548]  So, I watch Rudker's lady saying, you know, her mother barely made it out of the Holocaust, and I'm glad she did, to Hillary.
[00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:30.693]  And then they sit there, in the video, and
[00:15:34.554 --> 00:15:38.317]  There's Hillary, who works for Nazi collaborator George Soros, nodding her head about it.
[00:15:38.377 --> 00:15:39.077]  It's just crazy.
[00:15:39.337 --> 00:15:41.159]  These are actual Nazi collaborators.
[00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:45.321]  Minyon is shitting there that funded the Arab Spring, funds radical jihad all over the world.
[00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:48.484]  All this, and we've got to hear about how Trump is a Nazi.
[00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:53.767]  It's just the most incredible, upside-down world garbage the planet's ever seen.
[00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:56.429]  Okay, all this is coming up and so much more.
[00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:58.150]  Companies brace for trade war.
[00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.853]  Trump announces he's going to put troops on the border permanently till the wall's done.
[00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:09.058]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:17.523]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:16:17.683 --> 00:16:22.406]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:23.466]  We only have 150%.
[00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:24.607]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[00:16:26.488 --> 00:16:28.770]  Well now it's 50% off.
[00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:37.719]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:39.261]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.942]  But the two go together.
[00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:42.724]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:47.449]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.274]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:52.574 --> 00:16:57.380]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.125]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today.
[00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:05.449]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:07.171]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:19.262]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:28.812]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:17:29.272 --> 00:17:35.096]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:39.979]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:42.801]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:44.502]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:54.508]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:56.710]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.135]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:02.395 --> 00:18:10.082]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarslife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:18:10.943 --> 00:18:15.006]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:18:15.507 --> 00:18:17.849]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.773]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:18:23.277 --> 00:18:35.411]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:18:36.112 --> 00:18:42.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy,
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:51.185]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:08.545]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.332 --> 00:20:32.393]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:34.274]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:36.054 --> 00:20:40.235]  I'm picking up a fake transmission.
[00:20:40.515 --> 00:20:43.976]  I think it's Alex Jones calling.
[00:20:44.116 --> 00:20:44.636]  On screen.
[00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:46.737]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:50.618]  You think you're gonna assassinate Trump?
[00:20:50.698 --> 00:20:54.659]  Or shoot down the independent media and bully a bunch of us that are going along with you?
[00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:58.309]  I'd like reserve time.
[00:20:58.489 --> 00:20:58.729]  No.
[00:20:58.769 --> 00:21:00.110]  ...from being willing to have a fight.
[00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.671]  Wanting one at this point.
[00:21:01.911 --> 00:21:07.274]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros droppings.
[00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:07.795]  Stabilize.
[00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:08.935]  Emergency reserve.
[00:21:08.975 --> 00:21:11.937]  Hillary Clinton and the New World Order and Michael Moore.
[00:21:12.017 --> 00:21:13.998]  Go back to Hades where you came from.
[00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:18.641]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:20.222]  You got that, Jack?
[00:21:20.262 --> 00:21:20.943]  You're done.
[00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:21.843]  It's over.
[00:21:22.023 --> 00:21:22.664]  Worldwide.
[00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:24.164]  Get him back.
[00:21:24.204 --> 00:21:25.045]  Get him back.
[00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:50.078]  This is the broadcast that they hate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:55.641]  This is the transmission that the globalists loathe, because we've got their number.
[00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:22.839]  Well, the good news is President Trump is meeting with Peter Thiel this week, and they're moving ahead with a plan to break up the big telecoms, to break up the big tech companies, to break up all these different institutions that have been censoring and bullying conservative media, but particularly Google and its subsidiary YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:25.320]  And they're all on the chopping block.
[00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:28.739]  Axios has tried.
[00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:31.971]  That's, of course, Politico.
[00:22:33.345 --> 00:22:36.327]  Kind of sheep-dipping, something that sounds independent because I know they're so discredited.
[00:22:37.328 --> 00:22:54.198]  Axios and its anti-free speech operations had an article out last week about, oh, he's obsessed with Bezos and he's obsessed with how they get up to $1.50 apiece on every package and how they've got all these special rules that allow them to be basically monopolistic.
[00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.660]  But it's a lot bigger than just Amazon.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.643]  It's all of them on the chopping blocks from my sources.
[00:23:01.443 --> 00:23:10.405]  And there's a good article from InformationLiberation.com up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com that breaks it down and then lines up with my sources.
[00:23:11.305 --> 00:23:14.625]  In fact, I know Corsi's got some of the same sources in the White House.
[00:23:15.325 --> 00:23:16.886]  Mike Adams is here in the next hour.
[00:23:17.786 --> 00:23:18.746]  He's loaded for bear.
[00:23:19.226 --> 00:23:21.867]  Roger Stone is coming up host of the fourth hour.
[00:23:22.187 --> 00:23:24.727]  They were claiming he was in England meeting with Assange when he wasn't.
[00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:28.648]  He's released his credit card and bank records and hotel records when he was in California.
[00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:29.868]  It's just crazy now.
[00:23:33.632 --> 00:23:36.653]  And then even Politico has to admit that Trump is right.
[00:23:36.773 --> 00:23:38.574]  It is the Amazon Washington Post.
[00:23:38.754 --> 00:23:44.776]  Oh my gosh, we need Politico now, just today, to tell us what we told you a couple years ago when he bought it?
[00:23:45.176 --> 00:23:48.818]  And he ordered them to try to bring down Trump during the election and then once he got elected?
[00:23:50.247 --> 00:23:54.988]  And then he got $600 million from the Obama CIA to run the operation.
[00:23:55.048 --> 00:23:56.909]  Bezos wouldn't even use his own money.
[00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:02.551]  He had to get it from Obama in a government contract when Trump was president-elect.
[00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:05.632]  Oh, here's 600 mil for the Washington Post extra.
[00:24:05.892 --> 00:24:06.512]  Bring him down.
[00:24:07.861 --> 00:24:10.802]  And then Bezos is cutting their pay and won't give them bonuses.
[00:24:11.002 --> 00:24:11.543]  And they love it!
[00:24:12.303 --> 00:24:14.844]  They love working for a rich guy that pays no taxes.
[00:24:15.064 --> 00:24:17.185]  The left loves Apple paying no taxes.
[00:24:17.905 --> 00:24:19.386]  They love the suicide nets.
[00:24:19.406 --> 00:24:21.387]  They love the Foxconn laboratories.
[00:24:21.607 --> 00:24:22.828]  They love the forced abortion.
[00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:23.988]  They love evil.
[00:24:24.248 --> 00:24:25.309]  They love being screwed.
[00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:27.049]  They're in a cult of losers.
[00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:30.411]  They worship him.
[00:24:32.267 --> 00:24:35.334]  And he just walks around acting real friendly with his fake goofy laugh.
[00:24:40.762 --> 00:24:42.423]  You gotta pull up old interviews of Bezos.
[00:24:42.463 --> 00:24:43.424]  I'm gonna do a video of these.
[00:24:44.284 --> 00:24:45.485]  I know he hates this broadcast.
[00:24:45.645 --> 00:24:51.088]  He works hard at the Washington Post to have articles almost every week saying Jones is a snake oil salesman.
[00:24:51.128 --> 00:24:52.209]  Jones sells supplements.
[00:24:52.469 --> 00:24:53.650]  Supplements are fraudulent.
[00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.431]  Supplements are bad when Jones sells them.
[00:24:55.691 --> 00:25:01.274]  But he's the biggest supplement seller in the world and sells at least 18 of the exact supplements I sell.
[00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:02.735]  I just have my label on them.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:04.900]  Side issue.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.501]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:10.963]  So, here is one announcement I do want to go ahead and make for everyone.
[00:25:10.983 --> 00:25:17.287]  And there's a video breaking it down on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:18.087 --> 00:25:21.149]  Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered.
[00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:27.152]  Alex Jones to hold press conference against Soros-backed lawsuits.
[00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:35.549]  On Tuesday, April 10th, Alex Jones, myself truly, will make a statement and take questions from the press in Washington, D.C.
[00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:40.450]  on the anti-free speech lawsuits targeting his First Amendment rights.
[00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:47.092]  The National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Zinger Room, 9 a.m.
[00:25:47.993 --> 00:25:48.333]  Eastern,
[00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:51.227]  And it'll go for three hours.
[00:25:51.287 --> 00:25:57.330]  I'm also going to broadcast from there, and I haven't got around to this, but I'm going to call C-SPAN and say, don't you think you should also carry this?
[00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.131]  Everybody should call C-SPAN right now.
[00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:01.172]  The listeners should, and say, hey, carry this.
[00:26:01.832 --> 00:26:05.474]  Live streams of the press conference will be available at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:26:06.494 --> 00:26:12.217]  To attend the press conference, press must RSVP via email at, and we have that linked
[00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:18.662]  M-E-D-I-A-L-N-T at Infowars.com.
[00:26:19.363 --> 00:26:26.428]  And I don't know why we have such a weird, um, weird, weird email name for that.
[00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:30.050]  I want to change that, and then change it in the press release and have, you know, both there.
[00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:38.736]  I mean, we could have, like, Shooter, Supercatcher, Frizzelastic, Expialidocious, as the name.
[00:26:38.756 --> 00:26:39.917]  Make it as hard as possible.
[00:26:41.786 --> 00:26:42.708]  I know, Media Int.
[00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:43.249]  I know, I know.
[00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.990]  I just want to change it.
[00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.032]  I just read this here.
[00:26:45.052 --> 00:26:45.553]  I don't know where.
[00:26:45.573 --> 00:26:46.195]  I'm not mad.
[00:26:46.235 --> 00:26:48.058]  I just do this live on air.
[00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:48.960]  It's a cockamamie name.
[00:26:49.742 --> 00:26:50.944]  Anyways, and...
[00:26:57.179 --> 00:27:01.422]  And then put Alex Jones National Press Club speech in email subject line.
[00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:02.503]  I didn't write this press release.
[00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:06.405]  Alternatively, you can text, if you want to be there, to 512-954-5225.
[00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:14.371]  You will be sent a QR code that will allow you to enter the National Press Club facility.
[00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:16.132]  Access to the event is limited.
[00:27:16.152 --> 00:27:19.854]  And there's already over 50 press groups say they want to go.
[00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.417]  So, I'm going to look at all the media that comes in and then decide.
[00:27:23.937 --> 00:27:25.198]  I mean, I'm not mad about the...
[00:27:28.138 --> 00:27:32.162]  Can you guys put the clock back up there for me?
[00:27:32.282 --> 00:27:32.782]  Can I have that?
[00:27:32.802 --> 00:27:33.042]  Thanks.
[00:27:45.384 --> 00:27:50.429]  Because I just we've had this new clock and I still don't have it all memorized and it's really hit me and hit me hard.
[00:27:50.489 --> 00:27:50.849]  Thank you.
[00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:51.650]  I appreciate that.
[00:27:52.491 --> 00:28:01.119]  Just briefly here, the globalists are trying to shut us down, as you know, and we've got great products at great prices that make the transmission possible.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.982]  And if you don't support us, George Soros and the Globalists and all their attacks will be able to shut us down.
[00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:07.843]  It's just that simple.
[00:28:08.343 --> 00:28:09.584]  And so they're trying to take our sponsors.
[00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:10.864]  They've taken many of them, as you know.
[00:28:10.904 --> 00:28:11.965]  They're constantly attacking us.
[00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:13.626]  CNN wants us off YouTube.
[00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:16.047]  It'd be huge action if they could even keep that up.
[00:28:16.087 --> 00:28:20.609]  They're just coming for all your rights, and they see InfoWars as the very front line, because it is.
[00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:22.410]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.513]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:28.834 --> 00:28:33.878]  And we have had to end the Myco CX special, 50% off, because we're about to sell out of that.
[00:28:34.238 --> 00:28:38.441]  We're extending it one more day, and then that's it for Brain Force Plus and the Real Red Pill.
[00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:39.682]  You can also get those as a combo.
[00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:42.564]  They're amazing products, and get free shipping on that as well.
[00:28:42.984 --> 00:28:46.647]  And we now have the Super Blue Concentrated Immune Gargle.
[00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:48.048]  It's actually a supplement.
[00:28:48.068 --> 00:28:48.768]  You can swallow it.
[00:28:49.129 --> 00:28:52.391]  What I do is I gargle it out, spit it out, brush my teeth, get it all clean, then I drink a little bit.
[00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:57.835]  And it is just amazing with high-quality iodine and high-quality nano silver in it as well.
[00:28:58.196 --> 00:29:01.678]  Super Blue Immune Gargle now in three different containers, three different sizes.
[00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:09.965]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:11.966]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[00:29:11.987 --> 00:29:15.289]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:21.094]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[00:29:22.298 --> 00:29:23.238]  In these lawsuits, Alex,
[00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.211]  I know the costs.
[00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:51.733]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight the pony lawsuits.
[00:29:52.154 --> 00:30:01.439]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight the lawsuits against you and against InfoWars because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:11.245]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button.
[00:30:11.785 --> 00:30:13.107]  We're good to go.
[00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.770]  Exactly.
[00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.231]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPB and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:46.411]  We have the listeners doing it.
[00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:54.573]  And we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you, saying you're a Russian agent, and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[00:30:54.613 --> 00:30:55.294]  We're winning.
[00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:56.634]  It's why they're targeting us.
[00:30:56.834 --> 00:30:59.935]  But people need to know, this is the war for this republic.
[00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:00.575]  This is it.

[00:33:06.793 --> 00:33:09.495]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.417 --> 00:33:31.299]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:56.047]  The reason they want to shut us down is because we've got their number.
[00:33:56.407 --> 00:33:57.667]  We know the globalist plan.
[00:33:57.707 --> 00:33:58.488]  We've read their books.
[00:33:58.768 --> 00:33:59.848]  We've read their white papers.
[00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:01.609]  We know how their operations are carried out.
[00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:12.673]  And they thought you were so stupid, and the public was so dumb, they have a private corporate world government, tax-exempt, with diplomatic immunity, backed up by the communist Chinese.
[00:34:13.686 --> 00:34:16.791]  That killed over 80 million people, they say.
[00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:18.954]  The CIA says it's 65 million.
[00:34:19.334 --> 00:34:19.715]  I don't know.
[00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:28.889]  The Chinese government says 80 plus million died under the Communist Revolution of Mao, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution.
[00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:37.964]  And then I just walk all over Austin and see UT students with Mao Tse Tung shirts on, and they're not joking around like wearing an old Russian shirt or something.
[00:34:38.444 --> 00:34:40.045]  You know, it's the CCP or whatever.
[00:34:40.865 --> 00:34:50.469]  And they're into it, and they love it, and they got tattoos of it, and they got smartphones, and $100, $200 skinny jeans, and they're getting in nice cars their parents are paid for.
[00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.050]  And you go, this doesn't ideologically make any sense.
[00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.770]  Yeah, it does.
[00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.712]  They want power, and they want to direct everybody, and they want to kill the Midwest.
[00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:02.774]  They don't want to just reorganize things.
[00:35:02.915 --> 00:35:04.922]  They want a giant bloodletting.
[00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:06.146]  It's their religion.
[00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:08.789]  They hate flyover country.
[00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:10.050]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.170]  Hillary hates you.
[00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.270]  They all hate you.
[00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.311]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:30.015]  If you're black, if you're white, if you're Hispanic, if you're Asian, if you're a Christian, if you're a conservative, if you are self-sufficient, if you are not a Satanist, if you are not mentally ill, they want to put you in a forced labor camp and watch you starve to death because it makes them feel powerful.
[00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.896]  They want to rape your wife.
[00:35:32.517 --> 00:35:38.022]  They want, just like in East Germany, if you want to be in the theater or be involved, you've got to have sex with the party officials.
[00:35:38.283 --> 00:35:41.106]  They want to be able to kill and rape whoever they want.
[00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:47.872]  They want authoritarianism to carry out criminal operations and the raping of your children.
[00:35:48.253 --> 00:35:54.259]  Their religion is pedophilia and torturing people to death and starving you to death and murdering you.
[00:35:55.788 --> 00:36:10.114]  It's why their God helped round up Nazis when he was 14, 15, 16 for his stepfather and helped round up thousands and told 60 Minutes it was the best time of his life and he would do it over again and he's not ashamed.
[00:36:11.094 --> 00:36:13.135]  If somebody else didn't do it, he would have done it.
[00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:16.296]  And by the way, I've said this and I love everybody.
[00:36:18.937 --> 00:36:24.440]  But when we put together two different compilations of that video from
[00:36:25.492 --> 00:36:33.556]  That transmission that I've aired before that they try to take down, we didn't put it out with the parts where he said it was the best time of his life.
[00:36:34.897 --> 00:36:37.898]  So I want another version of that that I'm gonna air today.
[00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:41.120]  It doesn't matter what happens, it's gonna air.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.600]  In fact, I'll just air the whole thing.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.721]  In fact, just get me the entire 60 minutes.
[00:36:45.062 --> 00:36:45.602]  That's what I'll do.
[00:36:45.642 --> 00:36:46.882]  I'll air the whole 12-minute segment.
[00:36:47.283 --> 00:36:48.383]  I will not be stopped!
[00:36:50.044 --> 00:36:53.826]  Because if I get on my knees and beg for something particularly, I don't get it!
[00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:56.645]  But I'm not Tacoma, got that?
[00:36:56.805 --> 00:36:57.585]  I'm not in one!
[00:36:57.605 --> 00:37:00.966]  I'm gonna stop that Nazi piece of crap!
[00:37:02.266 --> 00:37:03.187]  And you're gonna stop him!
[00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:05.987]  And he hates our guts, well we're coming for you, you got it?
[00:37:07.087 --> 00:37:08.528]  But that's who they worship, you understand?
[00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:11.828]  He's their God, because he's a killer!
[00:37:12.629 --> 00:37:13.229]  They love it!
[00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:14.289]  They think it's sharp!
[00:37:14.689 --> 00:37:15.629]  They think it's sexy!
[00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.450]  I've read about, they worship Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:23.059]  Because he manipulated the camera rouge into killing millions.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.360]  And they just think, the more people you've killed, the more power you've got.
[00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:31.841]  I'm gonna go to rebroadcast and get that clip myself.
[00:37:32.921 --> 00:37:33.501]  That's the answer.
[00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:34.502]  Just gotta take action!
[00:37:35.282 --> 00:37:36.062]  What it's all about!
[00:37:37.402 --> 00:37:38.262]  Get out of the coma!
[00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:46.344]  Now... That said... The good news here, ladies and gentlemen...
[00:37:51.249 --> 00:37:57.193]  Is that this article to you, because this is actually happening, and this is the good news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:59.354 --> 00:38:04.478]  But you think about all those leftist people, and now I've realized this the last few years, they like the evil.
[00:38:04.538 --> 00:38:05.839]  They know their bosses are evil.
[00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:06.859]  They like it.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.423]  They're talking to some rich kid that's a communist, and they're getting in their Jaguar, and they go, yeah, Alex, we're going to kill you.
[00:38:14.004 --> 00:38:15.325]  We want to, we're devil worshipers.
[00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:17.868]  Yes, we know communism is devil worshipped.
[00:38:18.148 --> 00:38:19.068]  You think we don't know?
[00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:24.229]  And you realize it's just a party of devil worshippers that want to kill everybody!
[00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:25.030]  My God!
[00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.010]  You know how many sports stadiums 80 million people is?
[00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:33.252]  Let's just round down from 84 million of the Communist Chinese say Mao killed, to 80 million.
[00:38:33.272 --> 00:38:34.432]  Let's just round down 4 million.
[00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:43.575]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 people, think about it, is 80 million?
[00:38:45.162 --> 00:38:45.942]  Do your math for yourself.
[00:38:47.583 --> 00:38:48.863]  You kind of just lose it, don't you?
[00:38:48.883 --> 00:38:51.504]  You can't really think of it as humans, because it's 80 million.
[00:38:53.825 --> 00:39:00.447]  But if it's one person shot at a high school, then they tell you, it's all, we're all so sad, and it's all your fault, collectively.
[00:39:01.588 --> 00:39:02.448]  Turn your guns in.
[00:39:03.889 --> 00:39:04.649]  That's the answer.
[00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:06.710]  That's what needs to be done.
[00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:08.970]  That's what we're going to do.
[00:39:12.532 --> 00:39:13.152]  See how that works?
[00:39:15.287 --> 00:39:16.649]  That's how these sickos operate.
[00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.611]  That's their world.
[00:39:17.631 --> 00:39:18.672]  They think you're unconscious.
[00:39:18.712 --> 00:39:19.553]  They think you're dumb.
[00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:20.715]  They think you're food.
[00:39:20.976 --> 00:39:22.258]  They want to have their way with you.
[00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:25.222]  And the question is, are you going to let them have their way?
[00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.223]  I mean, look at Hogg.
[00:39:26.344 --> 00:39:26.985]  They're God.
[00:39:28.327 --> 00:39:29.268]  Of course he's on Reddit.
[00:39:29.308 --> 00:39:30.910]  Of course they haven't denied that's his Reddit, because it is.
[00:39:32.384 --> 00:39:34.725]  Celebrating mosquitoes killing billions of humans.
[00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:44.248]  And we put that out just like we put it out five years ago about the stingray systems with the actual documents and how it's run with the state and federal and local and how it's not used to stop crime and all the rest of it.
[00:39:44.768 --> 00:39:50.470]  And no, now the Pulitzer Prize winning AP is reporting word for word but not even showing you the documents.
[00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:57.152]  That's why they hate us because they don't control this operation with their bullying and their threats and all the rest of it.
[00:39:57.172 --> 00:39:58.313]  They do not do it.
[00:40:00.674 --> 00:40:01.714]  They don't control Trump either.
[00:40:04.907 --> 00:40:06.549]  See, Trump's crime is he likes women.
[00:40:06.669 --> 00:40:07.470]  He's not a pedophile.
[00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.051]  Seriously.
[00:40:08.812 --> 00:40:09.612]  He doesn't want to hurt you.
[00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:10.513]  He doesn't want to see you poor.
[00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:13.437]  He wants to run over big, rich, powerful globals.
[00:40:14.498 --> 00:40:16.600]  He wants to rub their faces in the mud because they deserve it.
[00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:23.628]  And that's why they hate him, because he can't be bought either, and he can't be bullied, and he can't be intimidated because he hasn't had his spirit broken.
[00:40:23.848 --> 00:40:24.970]  He's not in a coma.
[00:40:26.431 --> 00:40:30.573]  Report Trump to host Peter Thiel to talk regulation of big tech.
[00:40:30.793 --> 00:40:39.077]  The dinner, a source close to Thiel said, will be a strategy session on how the president might be able to regulate Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.
[00:40:41.498 --> 00:40:49.903]  The Daily Mail reports Trump is having dinner Tuesday night with his biggest Silicon Valley backer, Peter Thiel.
[00:40:50.888 --> 00:40:51.649]  And it just goes on.
[00:40:52.009 --> 00:40:55.091]  And I just thought I should point that out, because those meetings have been going on.
[00:40:55.592 --> 00:40:57.193]  And those things have been happening.
[00:40:57.593 --> 00:40:58.834]  And it is being prepared.
[00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:16.349]  And so, all the big tech giants and the rest of it, if you think $30 billion lost by Amazon, when Trump just put a few tweets out, or Sarah Sanders made a few statements, or a statement, and if you think $40 plus billion out of Facebook,
[00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:23.436]  When the president made some statements, when all that stuff came out, you leftists are stupid, stupid, stupid people.
[00:41:23.676 --> 00:41:25.338]  You may be vampiric and predatory.
[00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:33.486]  All the statistics, all the studies around the world show leftists are vampiric, predatory, stupid, dull, fake people that virtue signal all day because they don't have any real virtue.
[00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:34.547]  They're completely fake.
[00:41:34.567 --> 00:41:38.071]  And they'll sit there and act all nice and sacrimonious and everything else.
[00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:38.852]  They're a bunch of scum.
[00:41:40.746 --> 00:41:42.469]  Grasping, hateful, weak people.
[00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.032]  Upset that they're weak.
[00:41:44.192 --> 00:41:45.895]  Upset that they're particularly fallen.
[00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:47.417]  Upset that they're stupid.
[00:41:47.598 --> 00:41:48.699]  And they want to drag you down with them.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.521]  It's that simple.
[00:41:52.642 --> 00:41:53.823]  And so that's what you have to understand.
[00:41:53.883 --> 00:41:55.344]  They want to destroy you.
[00:41:55.404 --> 00:41:56.826]  They want to make you poor.
[00:41:57.046 --> 00:41:58.307]  They want to destroy you.
[00:41:58.487 --> 00:42:00.048]  They destroy countries on purpose.
[00:42:00.449 --> 00:42:01.410]  This is what they do.
[00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.771]  Everywhere they get control.
[00:42:03.071 --> 00:42:06.534]  Because they just want to rape and murder people all day.
[00:42:07.255 --> 00:42:13.660]  And when things fully collapse, and there's no more infrastructure, then good people don't have a way to fight back, and they get to have their way.
[00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:17.343]  So once you understand that, then you understand their whole ballgame.
[00:42:18.204 --> 00:42:19.685]  Soros wants to do one thing.
[00:42:20.729 --> 00:42:28.514]  Overthrow countries, destroy good economies, bankrupt people, have them as poor and stoned out of their minds with junkies and needles laying everywhere.
[00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:44.225]  Because when you're a demon, that makes him feel good when he glides around amongst the filth and skid row, when he flies over in his private jet and looks down at rotting cities and ugliness and ugly architecture and just steaming, you know, wildfires and death and starvation.
[00:42:44.245 --> 00:42:50.349]  He just soars above the death like the angel of death, just smelling the spiritual stench, just, oh, I feel good now.
[00:42:51.189 --> 00:42:52.630]  Oh, I'm just ruining life.
[00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.630]  Oh, I'm gonna pull him down in a pit with me.
[00:42:55.310 --> 00:43:00.752]  Oh, God, I love Alistair Crowley as a... Oh, it's so good.
[00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:16.537]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:43:19.053 --> 00:43:25.155]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:43:26.575 --> 00:43:29.096]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:43:29.897 --> 00:43:33.318]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:36.439]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[00:43:38.139 --> 00:43:43.281]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:43:45.259 --> 00:43:51.862]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:43:52.823 --> 00:43:53.843]  It's up to us personally.
[00:43:55.224 --> 00:44:02.068]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:44:02.588 --> 00:44:03.889]  I expected that to happen.
[00:44:05.049 --> 00:44:06.390]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:44:08.382 --> 00:44:19.306]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:21.547]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:44:22.247 --> 00:44:33.872]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:44:34.452 --> 00:44:36.633]  And we've already come so far together
[00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:46.685]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:44:47.265 --> 00:44:52.669]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:44:53.810 --> 00:45:01.655]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:45:03.908 --> 00:45:12.175]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:45:12.575 --> 00:45:14.156]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[00:45:15.157 --> 00:45:17.819]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.441]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[00:45:20.481 --> 00:45:25.365]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:45:26.466 --> 00:45:37.243]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:45:37.283 --> 00:45:41.249]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:45:42.671 --> 00:45:43.312]  Our game changing.
[00:45:43.752 --> 00:45:45.253]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[00:45:45.473 --> 00:45:48.015]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:49.556]  The other equation of probiotic.
[00:45:49.616 --> 00:45:53.199]  It's now stronger and a lower price in fullwrestore.com.
[00:45:53.499 --> 00:45:54.600]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:59.043]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[00:45:59.603 --> 00:46:02.806]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:03.946]  It just does incredible things.
[00:46:04.367 --> 00:46:05.848]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[00:46:05.868 --> 00:46:08.830]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.392]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:46:11.912 --> 00:46:16.715]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:46:17.336 --> 00:46:28.484]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[00:46:28.944 --> 00:46:35.809]  Silver, salt, nano silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[00:46:36.049 --> 00:46:37.990]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:10.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.841]  The Symphony of Destruction.
[00:47:33.988 --> 00:47:35.249]  Trying to extinct humanity.
[00:47:38.348 --> 00:47:40.169]  They're trying to teach us to hate ourselves.
[00:47:41.009 --> 00:47:42.910]  They're trying to get us to turn our life force off.
[00:47:44.251 --> 00:47:57.518]  And notice when I talk about this, they'll have the right-wing watch and the Soros-funded Media Matters put up the great truths I state as if they're the authority and as if they state the great truth and go, look at the horrible thing he did.
[00:47:57.978 --> 00:48:03.281]  People will go, look, Jones said the sun rises, but Media Matters pointed it out, so it must not be true.
[00:48:03.721 --> 00:48:07.123]  It's a bizarre appeal to authority as if they're the authority.
[00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.490]  And as if they're giving the marching orders.
[00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:24.515]  But they do give the marching orders to CNN, MSNBC, and others on how to tell the lies, and how to spin the information, and how to edit the videos, and how to destroy the country, how to bring in the world government.
[00:48:25.175 --> 00:48:31.377]  But to just see Trump in that tweet, I meant to have you guys pull it up, where he said, we're not in a trade war.
[00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:34.998]  Like the media says, we lost the trade war.
[00:48:36.943 --> 00:48:43.487]  In the last 40 years, being sold out to the Communist Chinese, and now the surrender is over.
[00:48:44.528 --> 00:48:45.888]  That's what I've been saying for several years.
[00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:47.910]  We lost the trade war.
[00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.891]  These aren't trade wars.
[00:48:50.511 --> 00:48:59.196]  If they're stealing 300 billion intellectual property, and we got a 450 million a year, 500 million deficit, put the math together, that's 800 to 850
[00:49:02.813 --> 00:49:07.115]  Billion, not counting the other 400 plus billion globally in trade deficit.
[00:49:07.555 --> 00:49:22.761]  So now you're up to 30, you're up to 100, you're up to... I can't even do the math anymore of the giant systematic screw job this country has been under via these globalist authoritarians.
[00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:25.923]  And then people sit there and go, oh,
[00:49:28.484 --> 00:49:30.785]  Infowars, you know, that's so radical.
[00:49:32.505 --> 00:49:38.428]  Even mainline conservatives, libertarians, thinking they get some type of brownie point with mainstream media.
[00:49:38.468 --> 00:49:40.068]  You guys are followers.
[00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:42.409]  You guys are children.
[00:49:43.429 --> 00:49:47.371]  I am not trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:50.292]  I'm trying to destroy the New World Order.
[00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:52.533]  I'm trying to destroy the globalists.
[00:49:52.753 --> 00:49:53.253]  There's the tweet.
[00:49:53.513 --> 00:49:54.013]  Total truth.
[00:49:55.254 --> 00:49:55.614]  Out today.
[00:49:56.533 --> 00:49:58.054]  We are not in a trade war with China.
[00:49:58.074 --> 00:50:01.255]  That war was lost many years ago by foolish or incompetent people.
[00:50:01.315 --> 00:50:01.935]  No, they were traitors.
[00:50:02.435 --> 00:50:03.296]  Who represented the U.S.
[00:50:03.376 --> 00:50:09.238]  And now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion.
[00:50:09.898 --> 00:50:11.279]  We cannot let this continue.
[00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:17.661]  It's really like $1,300 billion if you count the other trade deficits together.
[00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:18.881]  The whole total is $1,300 billion.
[00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:19.662]  $1,300 billion.
[00:50:26.516 --> 00:50:29.078]  It's even hard to say numbers like that.
[00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:35.584]  $1,300 billion dollar trade deficit to try to prop up a communist regime when it's not even communist.
[00:50:36.405 --> 00:50:44.012]  It's just an oligarchy of mass murderers ruling over people and killing their babies when they catch them hiding until a year old.
[00:50:44.792 --> 00:50:49.697]  Killing 70 million little girls at least in the womb.
[00:50:50.782 --> 00:50:59.848]  Holding political dissidents who've done nothing but call for free speech, or who are Christian, or who are caught practicing any form of religion.
[00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:03.371]  You dead.
[00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.314]  And the left here is just creamy-eyed.
[00:51:07.834 --> 00:51:09.035]  Creamy-eyed.
[00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:14.259]  So, you think about how they're in love with that, and they've got that look.
[00:51:15.612 --> 00:51:19.675]  You know, I was watching video about the cult that was out in Oregon in the 80s, and I'd actually read a book on that.
[00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:21.416]  I knew a bodyguard guy in L.A.
[00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:24.458]  that worked for some folks who'd actually been one of the security people there when he was like a teenager.
[00:51:24.598 --> 00:51:25.639]  He said, oh no, it's all true.
[00:51:25.659 --> 00:51:31.423]  We were ordered to put rattlesnakes in people's, you know, mailboxes and stuff.
[00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:33.665]  That fella's not in the movie, but I've confirmed he was there.
[00:51:33.685 --> 00:51:42.031]  And they talk about the look of people that are mind-controlled, and they've got that, oh, we love our leader, he is the Lord.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.863]  And then behind the scenes, it's just devil worship and flopping around and all this stuff.
[00:51:48.444 --> 00:51:49.685]  And it's the same thing with the left.
[00:51:50.365 --> 00:51:57.130]  You finally get into who they are, a group of atheists or any of them, they are on their knees possessed.
[00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.733]  Wild Wild Country's most shocking reveals from the sex cult's FBI informant.
[00:52:03.594 --> 00:52:07.377]  I've talked to people that were inside of it and they say it's worse than what you see in that movie.
[00:52:07.677 --> 00:52:10.559]  In fact, the show I've been watching is like a whitewash of this stuff.
[00:52:12.219 --> 00:52:15.960]  And all I'm getting at is, ladies and gentlemen, is I know how evil the globalists are.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.660]  Arianna Huffington's been connected to that group as well.
[00:52:19.081 --> 00:52:20.101]  I know what they're into.
[00:52:20.261 --> 00:52:21.321]  I know how they operate.
[00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:24.302]  I've been told by people in Hollywood that it's worse than I know.
[00:52:24.942 --> 00:52:25.762]  Very serious people.
[00:52:26.782 --> 00:52:32.003]  And... Hollywood promoted crap like that to make it popular.
[00:52:32.023 --> 00:52:34.304]  Until it got out of hand.
[00:52:36.044 --> 00:52:41.946]  So, I'm up here ranting about all this, and I get really mad because I know George Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[00:52:41.986 --> 00:52:42.606]  He bragged about it.
[00:52:44.146 --> 00:52:45.987]  I know he's coming after me in my free speech.
[00:52:46.067 --> 00:52:53.089]  I know he's in the WikiLeaks and other documents saying, give the internet to the UN, censor all conservatives off of it, and his plan's still being followed.
[00:52:53.389 --> 00:52:57.030]  Obama handed it over, and then Trump hasn't gotten it back yet.
[00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.711]  In fact, it isn't Trump even busting up the trust, it is Trump
[00:53:03.484 --> 00:53:07.545]  Trump getting control of the internet, our internet, back to the U.S.
[00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:09.405]  In fact, here's why I was frustrated earlier.
[00:53:09.425 --> 00:53:10.185]  I'm not mad at anybody.
[00:53:10.445 --> 00:53:12.026]  We've got the whole 12 minutes, 60 minutes piece.
[00:53:12.486 --> 00:53:18.527]  And the little promo piece we put together when he was denying he was a Nazi collaborator was admitting he didn't have a problem at all and went out and helped round up Jews.
[00:53:19.907 --> 00:53:21.288]  That's not even the key of the interview.
[00:53:21.688 --> 00:53:23.248]  It said he enjoyed it.
[00:53:23.488 --> 00:53:24.588]  It was the best time of his life.
[00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.068]  These are the quotes.
[00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:28.169]  And then I got Anderson Cooper.
[00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:39.494]  And Young Turk's guy saying I'm making it up, when I have the book he wrote, his dad wrote a book, he has given multiple interviews saying this, and they try to keep this interview from getting out there.
[00:53:39.514 --> 00:53:45.176]  So let's play that little clip that you guys were able to dig up, and let's play the little intro piece that's got Cooper denying it.
[00:53:45.236 --> 00:53:47.317]  But you gotta watch the whole thing.
[00:53:47.377 --> 00:53:49.517]  It's like, when he talks about it, he beams.
[00:53:49.577 --> 00:53:50.398]  He gets so happy.
[00:53:50.858 --> 00:53:53.599]  It was wonderful, and if I didn't do it, somebody else would.
[00:53:54.119 --> 00:53:56.301]  You know, I took care of myself, that's what matters.
[00:53:56.781 --> 00:54:04.786]  You're looking at a monstrous pig who was known as a criminal that overthrew governments, bankrupted economies all over the world, until he brought his money back to the U.S.
[00:54:04.826 --> 00:54:08.909]  in the 90s, bought off the Democratic Party with the Clintons, and basically took the country over!
[00:54:10.762 --> 00:54:14.123]  And he just runs wild, he just does whatever he wants, and I'm sick of him!
[00:54:14.283 --> 00:54:14.683]  Here it is.
[00:54:15.983 --> 00:54:24.385]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:54:24.505 --> 00:54:25.505]  Yes.
[00:54:25.605 --> 00:54:29.106]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:30.686]  That's right.
[00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:37.268]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for
[00:54:38.088 --> 00:54:39.969]  Many, many years.
[00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:40.609]  Was it difficult?
[00:54:40.909 --> 00:54:44.550]  Not at all.
[00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.631]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life.
[00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.712]  That year of German occupation.
[00:54:52.613 --> 00:54:53.793]  Okay, that's part of it.
[00:54:53.913 --> 00:54:54.173]  Good.
[00:54:54.213 --> 00:54:57.354]  I know we have a bunch of these clips, but I'm just going to air the whole stinking thing.
[00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.635]  I think I might just start airing it every day.
[00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:01.996]  We'll call it the Soros segment.
[00:55:02.256 --> 00:55:04.457]  And I'll show Cooper saying it doesn't exist.
[00:55:04.717 --> 00:55:05.337]  I'll show Sink.
[00:55:07.366 --> 00:55:15.408]  Who's named after a genocidal maniac group, the Young Turks, killed a hundred, excuse me, I can't even say the numbers, 1.5 million Christians conservatively.
[00:55:15.508 --> 00:55:16.149]  That's all confirmed.
[00:55:17.869 --> 00:55:20.530]  He says it doesn't exist and he's named after the murderous group.
[00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.811]  And he, by the way, wants me off the air and says I'm the worst person in the world.
[00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:27.412]  Imagine being that big a sellout and that big a scumbag.
[00:55:27.652 --> 00:55:32.073]  And the fact that we haven't routed these people easily really makes me feel pathetic.
[00:55:32.434 --> 00:55:32.834]  Here's a clip.
[00:55:38.328 --> 00:55:45.035]  Of all the financial titans and philanthropists of the 20th century, none are more complex or mysterious than George Soros.
[00:55:45.636 --> 00:55:46.937]  Like Carnegie, J.P.
[00:55:46.977 --> 00:55:56.367]  Morgan, and the Rockefellers, he amassed billions through ruthless business decisions, only to turn around and give away most of his fortune to advance his own personal philosophy.
[00:55:57.108 --> 00:56:03.955]  He can move world financial markets simply by voicing an opinion, or destabilize a government by buying and selling its currency.
[00:56:04.495 --> 00:56:08.199]  He also pledged more aid last year to help people in Russia than the U.S.
[00:56:08.239 --> 00:56:08.840]  government did.
[00:56:09.581 --> 00:56:11.342]  But now George Soros is worried.
[00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:14.385]  He thinks the global economy is coming apart at the seams.
[00:56:14.405 --> 00:56:15.607]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:56:15.627 --> 00:56:18.690]  I need to do a whole documentary on this.
[00:56:20.239 --> 00:56:20.759]  I'm serious.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.843]  And just show how, just that interview, every two seconds is a lie.
[00:56:25.383 --> 00:56:28.085]  Oh, he gives money to Russia to overthrow it, on record.
[00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:28.786]  He brags about it.
[00:56:28.806 --> 00:56:31.328]  He just calls it overthrow if Ukraine tries to overthrow Russia.
[00:56:32.129 --> 00:56:33.090]  He calls it philanthropy.
[00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.391]  Oh, he gives it away.
[00:56:34.431 --> 00:56:36.692]  He gives it to his foundation so it's tax exempt.
[00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:43.198]  Like Bill and Melinda Gates, their wealth is doubled, tripled, quadrupled, where they put hundreds of billions into a foundation they own and control.
[00:56:43.618 --> 00:56:47.801]  Helicopters, bases, biggest jets, homes, everything tax exempt.
[00:56:48.562 --> 00:56:50.363]  And they're philanthropists.
[00:56:50.383 --> 00:56:53.105]  They put their money into it.
[00:56:53.185 --> 00:56:54.585]  It's so disgusting.
[00:56:55.446 --> 00:56:57.147]  By the way, we're not funded by all that.
[00:56:57.167 --> 00:56:58.167]  We don't overthrow governments.
[00:56:58.688 --> 00:56:58.868]  Hear him?
[00:56:58.888 --> 00:57:00.269]  Oh, he stabilizes governments.
[00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:01.349]  He's known for overthrowing them.
[00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:02.110]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.211]  You want to stop Soros?
[00:57:04.231 --> 00:57:05.431]  You want to stop these scumbags?
[00:57:05.451 --> 00:57:07.332]  Support your local station's sponsors.
[00:57:07.352 --> 00:57:08.113]  Become a sponsor.
[00:57:08.433 --> 00:57:10.034]  And spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:10.714]  Fight them hard.
[00:57:10.754 --> 00:57:12.475]  Realize there's a total attack going on here.

[00:57:28.546 --> 00:57:29.067]  They're amazing.

[00:57:44.215 --> 00:57:46.698]  And I got another big announcement I haven't even made because I'm so wound up today.
[00:57:46.998 --> 00:57:49.460]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, we are winning.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.061]  Thanks to you.
[00:57:52.597 --> 00:58:04.124]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:05.124]  We're exposed to lead.
[00:58:05.144 --> 00:58:06.185]  We're exposed to mercury.
[00:58:06.205 --> 00:58:11.207]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:16.590]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:18.832]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[00:58:19.612 --> 00:58:20.994]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[00:58:21.114 --> 00:58:24.757]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[00:58:24.857 --> 00:58:29.842]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[00:58:30.222 --> 00:58:35.688]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:58:36.068 --> 00:58:41.273]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[00:58:41.633 --> 00:58:42.594]  And over and over again.
[00:58:42.654 --> 00:58:49.540]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.982]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[00:58:52.102 --> 00:58:53.623]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:58:53.703 --> 00:59:07.114]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[00:59:07.134 --> 00:59:07.695]  Fertility is key.
[00:59:08.215 --> 00:59:24.805]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[00:59:25.185 --> 00:59:29.208]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[00:59:29.248 --> 00:59:32.790]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:34.651]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[00:59:35.131 --> 00:59:36.892]  Started losing weight, all this energy.
[00:59:36.912 --> 00:59:39.314]  I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[00:59:39.635 --> 00:59:44.118]  It's as important as vitamin C. You gotta have vitamin C. You gotta have iodine to live.
[00:59:44.138 --> 00:59:45.159]  You gotta have water to live.
[00:59:45.339 --> 00:59:48.842]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.

[00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:00.871]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.304 --> 01:00:20.746]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.546 --> 01:00:31.190]  A lot of people pick the wrong team.
[01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:43.955]  A lot of people bet it on the New World Order, they bet it on globalism, they bet on corporate crony capitalism, using socialism and communism at the grassroots level to enslave and ensnare and dumb down the people.
[01:00:45.996 --> 01:00:48.017]  And they're not going to get away with it.
[01:00:48.638 --> 01:00:53.120]  Mike Adams at naturalnews.com has been on fire lately.
[01:00:54.961 --> 01:01:01.604]  He is really worried about Hogg, and he said weeks before it even came out that he thinks Hogg is the most dangerous person in America.
[01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:05.980]  And as a globalist operative, there's no doubt he is one now.
[01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:07.582]  And very, very dangerous.
[01:01:07.602 --> 01:01:11.084]  Then we learn he is an anti-human exterminist in his own words.
[01:01:12.746 --> 01:01:20.171]  So we're going to look at that and take your phone calls and he's going to ride shotgun with us for at least an hour and a half because we're going to get into the waterfront here because I blew up in the last hour.
[01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:21.633]  People like that.
[01:01:21.773 --> 01:01:23.954]  The ratings go up when I do it, but it's not on purpose.
[01:01:25.656 --> 01:01:28.178]  And I'm not even mad at the grassroots enemies.
[01:01:28.338 --> 01:01:30.960]  I'm just frustrated I can't wake them up because they're such stooges.
[01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:51.424]  And then, at the same time, I know how able the globalists are from their own works, it's all come out, and it's just knowing they're so bad, and they're just sitting there, plotting against us, doing horrible things to the innocent, just everywhere they take control, they just enslave women, mass murder people, and it's just so bizarre.
[01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.806]  Now, they're allied with the most radical forms of Islam,
[01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:02.250]  And it's just, we'll talk about the YouTube shooting and all the weirdness there and sad that happened.
[01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.853]  Peter Thiel meeting with the President to start the...
[01:02:07.722 --> 01:02:11.245]  Operation to try to break up these monopolies, these anti-free speech groups.
[01:02:11.665 --> 01:02:12.326]  It's so huge.
[01:02:12.886 --> 01:02:14.287]  As Trump says, we're not in a trade war.
[01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:15.508]  We lost the trade war.
[01:02:15.548 --> 01:02:16.409]  Now we're fighting back.
[01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:19.491]  We only have, like, two steel-producing facilities left in the country.
[01:02:19.511 --> 01:02:21.692]  I mean, we've been completely de-industrialized.
[01:02:21.732 --> 01:02:34.142]  That was how the globalists said they would conquer us 50 years ago, and they've done it by infiltration and by siphoning off our industry and telling us it'd be a great new economic future to have no industry and to have a bunch of drugged-out, mindless, spoiled, rotten brats running around in giant
[01:02:34.822 --> 01:02:37.925]  Unskilled third-world populations pouring in to be brainwashed to be communist.
[01:02:39.186 --> 01:02:44.611]  So they attack the middle class as the bankers set offshore tax-exempt, getting rich off taxpayer money.
[01:02:44.892 --> 01:02:47.054]  Warren Buffett, hundreds of billions, the banker bailout.
[01:02:47.774 --> 01:02:53.700]  Bezos, hundreds and hundreds of billions over the last few decades and tax exemption and getting $1.50 per package.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.263]  Because they've said $1.48, but actually on average $1.50.
[01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.711]  So, this is just incredible.
[01:03:01.751 --> 01:03:09.077]  And you sit there with a leftist and you go, why do all the top billionaires that are tax exempt, authoritarian, want higher taxes than the middle class?
[01:03:09.097 --> 01:03:10.298]  And they go, shut up, racist!
[01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:13.381]  And you're like, but just have an intellectual debate.
[01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:14.402]  No, shut up!
[01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:14.922]  Shut up!
[01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:15.343]  Fake news!
[01:03:15.383 --> 01:03:15.703]  Fake news!
[01:03:15.723 --> 01:03:16.104]  Fake news!
[01:03:16.624 --> 01:03:17.425]  You're gonna be shut up!
[01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:18.946]  You're gonna be in prison, you Russian agent!
[01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:26.413]  And I'm just like, you're the globalist agents, you're the minions of these multinational corporations, but they can't understand it.
[01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:32.054]  They can't get it, and it's a cult!
[01:03:33.035 --> 01:03:35.397]  They are in the delusion that they're in the end club.
[01:03:36.558 --> 01:03:49.089]  They weren't cool in junior high or high school, and so they all want to end up being cool, and so the system creates a system where they can be in the cool club.
[01:03:50.512 --> 01:04:01.076]  Now most of the people that were the coolest in high school on average end up being losers, or just moderate level, serving the nerd class like Bezos.
[01:04:01.756 --> 01:04:04.077]  But that isn't glorifying the nerd class on average.
[01:04:04.737 --> 01:04:16.942]  Because a lot of times that nerd class becomes very, very sadistic, very, very OCD, very, very Aschbergers about their deployment of dominating and overriding people, and they want to become hyper-dominant.
[01:04:17.222 --> 01:04:24.931]  Because they weren't treated physically as baitish even though mentally you could argue that they were really alphas.
[01:04:25.913 --> 01:04:32.280]  But they're like twisted alphas because a real alpha wants to build a bigger system for everybody and wants to build a system of competition.
[01:04:33.228 --> 01:04:53.274]  And celebrate the human continuum, not create a system where they try to make everybody as weak as possible so an overclass of brain bugs can sit there and run the show and believe they're God, but still having the deep-seated inferiority complex and the hatred of themselves projected on the general population.
[01:04:53.814 --> 01:05:01.276]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWorse.com, InfoWorse.com are the dreaded websites with the dreaded articles and the dreaded videos that Soros wants to stop.
[01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:06.904]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:05:07.224 --> 01:05:13.967]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:05:14.267 --> 01:05:18.989]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:05:19.009 --> 01:05:19.529]  It's very simple.
[01:05:19.769 --> 01:05:21.910]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:24.111]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:26.112]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:05:26.192 --> 01:05:27.072]  We put $10 in it, and sell it for $30.
[01:05:27.192 --> 01:05:27.913]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.757]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:05:35.917 --> 01:05:40.040]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.163]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:05:44.203 --> 01:05:47.625]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:05:48.066 --> 01:05:50.988]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:54.630]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.172]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:05:57.472 --> 01:05:58.173]  It's amazing.
[01:05:58.493 --> 01:06:01.015]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:04.437 --> 01:06:09.519]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.744 --> 01:06:22.285]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got really angry in the last hour.
[01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:23.426]  It was organic.
[01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.627]  Nothing to do with the crew or the show or any of it.
[01:06:25.727 --> 01:06:26.087]  I'm just...
[01:06:27.438 --> 01:06:30.599]  Sick of knowing how evil the globalists and their program is.
[01:06:31.299 --> 01:06:33.560]  And yeah, people are awake, we're taking action, we're fighting back.
[01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:42.644]  But if people really knew how evil the globalists were and what their master plan was, people would be in the streets 365 days out of the year.
[01:06:42.704 --> 01:06:51.367]  You would not give any financial support or cultural support to anything leftist, anything globalist, because they are authoritarians and they want to run your life and they're evil.
[01:06:53.154 --> 01:06:54.815]  Now, they are also not the counterculture.
[01:06:55.675 --> 01:06:56.795]  They are the dominant culture.
[01:06:56.835 --> 01:07:02.877]  Now, Mike Adams is a really smart engineer, best-selling author, runs naturalnews.com and dozens of other top sites.
[01:07:03.338 --> 01:07:11.040]  He also has one of the biggest, most successful labs in the country testing products, and he's here with us for the next hour and a half at least to break down the waterfront.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.521]  We just talked during the short break.
[01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:15.102]  He's got a lot to get into, but I know you're on fire.
[01:07:16.172 --> 01:07:20.473]  And I've known you for, I don't know, 10 years or so, and you didn't used to talk like this, but now you do.
[01:07:20.533 --> 01:07:21.953]  You say, we can feel it.
[01:07:22.294 --> 01:07:23.374]  It's a spiritual war.
[01:07:23.674 --> 01:07:24.434]  They want to get us.
[01:07:24.454 --> 01:07:25.174]  They want to dominate us.
[01:07:25.234 --> 01:07:26.174]  And they can feel it, too.
[01:07:26.555 --> 01:07:38.417]  The residents in the planet, the spirit, whatever it is, is the globalists and their minions are now acting like horror movie zombies at the bottom, gremlins above that, and then basically like vampires above that.
[01:07:38.437 --> 01:07:44.059]  I'm not saying they actually drink blood, but this is an act of dominance, an act of control, an act of trying to bring us down.
[01:07:44.997 --> 01:07:50.263]  And the good news is, is Peter Thiel and Trump and others are moving to try to block this, to try to restart the economy.
[01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:53.287]  As Trump said in a tweet, we're not having a trade war.
[01:07:53.647 --> 01:07:55.129]  We're announcing the surrender is over.
[01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:57.311]  We lost a trade war in the last 30, 40 years.
[01:07:57.812 --> 01:07:59.574]  So it's an epic time to be alive.
[01:07:59.594 --> 01:08:01.496]  What would you call this period in history, Mike Adams?
[01:08:01.656 --> 01:08:03.858]  Well, this is the escalation of the spiritual war.
[01:08:03.938 --> 01:08:13.445]  This is an all-out... I mean, the demonic forces that are trying to destroy life, liberty, abundance, truth, transparency.
[01:08:13.846 --> 01:08:22.813]  It's an all-out war, and if I had a mantra for right now, it would be to tell everyone out there, especially the Republicans, stop negotiating with evil.
[01:08:23.413 --> 01:08:27.176]  Because the left wing has become... It is a cult, like you said.
[01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:28.477]  It's a left-wing cult.
[01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.480]  They are out to destroy life.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.003]  These same students that are talking about, oh, guns are killing kids.
[01:08:36.263 --> 01:08:41.547]  But they, their only objection to that is that those kids weren't young enough because they love abortion.
[01:08:41.587 --> 01:08:43.488]  They love to murder children in abortion.
[01:08:43.528 --> 01:08:45.430]  And then Hogg, you wrote the best article on it.
[01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:47.912]  Hogg is openly on Reddit hating women.
[01:08:48.812 --> 01:08:52.274]  Hating God and wanting mass death and of course that's their side.
[01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.154]  It's always the same.
[01:08:53.575 --> 01:09:14.445]  Well, yeah, yeah I mean ultimately and look these people they're banishing the First Amendment rights of us and many others and I do want to talk about this YouTube shooter if we get a chance because there's you got the floor you're on fire during that there that break I mean tackling this first though specifically to tell people about David Hogg and NBC and what they're doing you watch hogwash and
[01:09:14.505 --> 01:09:16.526]  Yeah, we launched a website hogwatch.com.
[01:09:16.726 --> 01:09:19.128]  H-O-G-G watch dot com.
[01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:37.580]  And NBC News began trolling it and they rolled out a hit piece and their trolls have been badgering and threatening natural news staff and they've been threatening my writers and they even tried to take down my non-profit called the Consumer Wellness Center.
[01:09:38.613 --> 01:09:50.048]  Not realizing that I am the board of directors of the Consumer Wellness Center, so they were, they were, they're saying that if we don't take down hogwatch.com, they're going to destroy the entire business, everything.
[01:09:50.549 --> 01:09:52.772]  And I just say to these people, you know what?
[01:09:53.553 --> 01:09:54.833]  We're standing up to you, bullies.
[01:09:55.153 --> 01:09:59.254]  You try to take away our First Amendment rights, our Second Amendment rights, our Fourth Amendment rights.
[01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:09.037]  You don't think that we have a right to exist, and I say to you tyrants at NBC News, we are standing up to you, bullies, because these people like David Hogg, they're used to getting their way.
[01:10:09.257 --> 01:10:12.898]  They scream and cry and whine in college or high school.
[01:10:13.118 --> 01:10:18.739]  And they cuss at me, and CNN says take me off the air because I'm critical of Hogg when he's a public figure.
[01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:19.979]  What is it about Hulk?
[01:10:20.119 --> 01:10:21.260]  No one is more protected.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:33.923]  Because even Paul Watson, who's from Sheffield, England, they sent a team of reporters from multiple agencies, they're really intelligence operatives, to bang on doors from his high school yearbook to ask people for dirt about Paul.
[01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:35.143]  Everybody said, no, he was a nice guy.
[01:10:35.463 --> 01:10:38.764]  But that's the level of even our writers now.
[01:10:39.084 --> 01:10:42.425]  This is like joining the military to join InfoWars.
[01:10:42.985 --> 01:10:45.286]  It's one step away from us receiving death threats.
[01:10:45.766 --> 01:10:50.251]  From NBC News fans and trolls who want to take us off the air.
[01:10:50.271 --> 01:10:56.918]  I mean, it's so bad Alex, I have never ever seen the media go all out to destroy any voice that's critical of one individual.
[01:10:57.158 --> 01:11:05.146]  And let's be clear, your whole operation has been under the radar, but your media empire is as big as Infowars, okay?
[01:11:05.607 --> 01:11:06.447]  Don't say that on the air.
[01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:14.593]  Well, I mean, here's the thing, that's why they don't know when they're hitting at one of your, one of, and it's a good tentacle, one of your tentacles, you've got all these other tentacles, they have no idea.
[01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.734]  They don't get we're bigger than them in most cases.
[01:11:16.975 --> 01:11:19.076]  They don't even know that they're attacking this island.
[01:11:19.096 --> 01:11:21.598]  They don't understand that there's a huge mountain underneath the water.
[01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:22.758]  Well, look, that's the truth.
[01:11:22.798 --> 01:11:27.982]  I mean, InfoWars is bigger than MSNBC, bigger than the Washington Post in terms of your actual audience.
[01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:33.085]  Our media base is bigger than, you know, CNN for sure.
[01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:34.006]  No question about it.
[01:11:34.466 --> 01:11:35.667]  Because we have so many different sites.
[01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:40.092]  One of those sites that we launched is hogwash.com, which has no advertisers, by the way.
[01:11:40.572 --> 01:11:43.475]  And the NBC News... By the way, I'm talking to you at 1 in the morning.
[01:11:43.495 --> 01:11:45.757]  You're working at 1 in the morning to put these articles out and fight.
[01:11:45.777 --> 01:11:46.398]  You're on fire.
[01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:46.998]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:47.379 --> 01:11:50.742]  We're totally dedicated to defending the Second Amendment and defending liberty and freedom.
[01:11:51.162 --> 01:11:53.805]  And most importantly, Alex, is standing up for our right to speak.
[01:11:54.345 --> 01:11:56.427]  We have a right to criticize.
[01:11:57.368 --> 01:11:59.449]  Someone like David Hogg, who wants to take away our liberties.
[01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.210]  David Hogg says he hopes we all die.
[01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:08.473]  He wants billions dead from mosquitoes for the earth, but he really cares about 16 students and wants us taken off the air.
[01:12:08.773 --> 01:12:19.417]  But you pointed this out, how his message of thanking the death of what he says is billions of people from mosquitoes is saving the environment that is so aligned with the globalist agenda.
[01:12:19.457 --> 01:12:23.619]  This is exactly what they say as well, that we have to have depopulation, they say.
[01:12:23.979 --> 01:12:26.221]  Plus, the thing is, I've never said he was a crisis actor.
[01:12:26.261 --> 01:12:29.504]  I said he sings from high-level sheet of music.
[01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:32.407]  Everything coming out of his mouth is a Soros talking point.
[01:12:32.647 --> 01:12:39.433]  And the Women's March is 100% funded by Soros, and they admit it took over these kids the day after the event on February 15th of this year.
[01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:41.275]  This is a Soros production.
[01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:42.716]  Oh absolutely it is.
[01:12:58.254 --> 01:13:00.115]  Just dreams of billions of dead.
[01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:11.642]  And, right now, think about today, the mainstream media has dropped the YouTube shooter story because the shooter turned out to be a Farsi-speaking, left-wing, animal rights, vegan activist.
[01:13:12.122 --> 01:13:13.703]  All of a sudden, doesn't fit their narrative.
[01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:15.184]  It's a woman, right?
[01:13:15.364 --> 01:13:16.224]  Doesn't fit the narrative.
[01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:19.426]  They wanted it to be, they were drooling, you saw this yesterday, they were drooling over the idea.
[01:13:19.446 --> 01:13:22.428]  Nancy Pelosi came out within 20 minutes and said it's band guns, it's right-wingers, right here.
[01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:26.250]  They thought, oh, it's going to be NRA, it's going to be a Trump supporter, it's going to be someone, you know what though?
[01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:40.006]  There is a big issue that we need to cover here that YouTube has put its employees, I believe, in the line of fire because some deranged, twisted individuals like that woman are gonna be, they're gonna snap.
[01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:43.250]  They were censored and demonetized and some of them are gonna snap.
[01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:46.954]  And do what she did, even though we never want to see that happen.
[01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:49.517]  We don't want harm to come to YouTube employees.
[01:13:49.857 --> 01:13:51.199]  We do want YouTube regulated.
[01:13:51.499 --> 01:13:52.900]  We do want them to stop censorship.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.082]  We don't want harm to come to them.
[01:13:54.502 --> 01:13:58.186]  But they're ruining the lives of many people who are going to snap from time to time.
[01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:01.910]  And those YouTube... I mean, I wouldn't mess with somebody that looks like that.
[01:14:03.018 --> 01:14:05.140]  She's very passionate about her belief system.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.220]  You can tell by her videos.
[01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:07.501]  She's very passionate.
[01:14:08.282 --> 01:14:12.345]  But obviously, obviously, she was pushed a little bit too far.
[01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:17.729]  And the censorship that YouTube... I take one look, somebody looks like that, that's a scary person.
[01:14:17.849 --> 01:14:18.670]  Well, yeah, sure.
[01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:20.011]  Yeah, she is.
[01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.051]  She's dead now.
[01:14:21.472 --> 01:14:22.092]  She's dead now.
[01:14:22.592 --> 01:14:25.515]  The one shot that she got accurate was the shot to her own head, apparently.
[01:14:26.275 --> 01:14:30.218]  Uh, the rest of the shots, she didn't, uh, apparently no one died at this point, correct?
[01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:30.578]  Yes.
[01:14:30.598 --> 01:14:32.019]  She was just injured, but not dead.
[01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:32.640]  Thank God.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:39.184]  But, I would say today, all of these tech giants, they need to be calling security companies, they need to be rethinking concealed carry policies.
[01:14:39.204 --> 01:14:43.407]  Well, we've got, we've got concealed carry here, we got guys with guns driving around the building.
[01:14:44.028 --> 01:14:45.269]  Yeah, I said hi to them on my way in.
[01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:47.497]  You're packing right now?
[01:14:47.537 --> 01:14:49.038]  Yeah, he knew I was carrying, by the way.
[01:14:49.058 --> 01:14:50.339]  Here, pull it out.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.600]  No, no, it's all right.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.841]  Well, no, it's America.
[01:14:52.861 --> 01:14:53.602]  Go ahead and show us your piece.
[01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:54.282]  No, it's okay.
[01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.243]  I'll keep it concealed.
[01:14:55.263 --> 01:14:56.164]  Show us your Glock.
[01:14:56.244 --> 01:14:57.185]  It rings out of building.
[01:14:57.205 --> 01:14:57.845]  You show us yours.
[01:14:57.985 --> 01:14:58.506]  No, it's all right.
[01:14:58.566 --> 01:14:59.006]  It's all right.
[01:14:59.867 --> 01:15:01.808]  But I'll show you during the break.
[01:15:01.849 --> 01:15:02.309]  How about that?
[01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:07.272]  But I do carry concealed here and everywhere else, you know, because it's my legal right to defend myself.
[01:15:07.813 --> 01:15:13.697]  YouTube employees are in the line of fire, a hail of bullets coming their way, and they have no means to defend themselves.
[01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:18.920]  So if you're a YouTube employee, I think you're thinking today, what have my employers put me into here?
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.825]  Where you could be killed by someone that you banned, that you censored, and your employer is not doing anything to protect you.
[01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:29.115]  I mean, that's a legitimate question that needs to be asked today.
[01:15:29.355 --> 01:15:31.618]  And it's not just YouTube, it's Google, it's Facebook, it's Twitter.
[01:15:31.638 --> 01:15:33.059]  They need to be beefing up security.
[01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:38.444]  Most importantly, rethinking their gun-free zone policies because gun-free zones don't work.
[01:15:38.864 --> 01:15:40.045]  Just proved it again yesterday.
[01:15:40.826 --> 01:15:41.346]  So obvious.
[01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:46.050]  I want to get into all these other subjects.
[01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:49.492]  The censorship and also arresting preppers in California now.
[01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:50.592]  We're going to look at it all.
[01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:52.233]  We're going to open the phones up later as well.
[01:15:52.273 --> 01:15:54.474]  Got a bunch of Trump clips straight ahead.
[01:15:54.694 --> 01:15:57.096]  And I'm going to be doing a press conference in D.C.
[01:15:57.456 --> 01:15:58.236]  coming up next week.
[01:15:58.296 --> 01:16:00.178]  The details of that are on InfoWars.com.
[01:16:00.218 --> 01:16:00.618]  Stay with us.
[01:16:02.597 --> 01:16:12.040]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.282]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:16:17.942 --> 01:16:29.286]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:43.576]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[01:16:44.376 --> 01:16:49.520]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.441]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat
[01:16:52.302 --> 01:17:00.088]  A lot of protein, and you don't chew it properly sometimes, there's buildup, you can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis, you name it.
[01:17:00.648 --> 01:17:02.950]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:11.575]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[01:17:12.116 --> 01:17:24.084]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[01:17:24.404 --> 01:17:26.926]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:31.549]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[01:17:31.949 --> 01:17:33.810]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:48.100]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.103]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[01:17:52.463 --> 01:17:54.545]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[01:17:54.905 --> 01:17:59.708]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[01:18:00.049 --> 01:18:02.931]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:05.152]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:05.653 --> 01:18:15.960]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:19.283]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[01:18:20.407 --> 01:18:33.194]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[01:18:33.794 --> 01:18:42.979]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:46.247]  This is the total win-win.
[01:18:46.767 --> 01:18:52.472]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:57.436]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[01:18:57.756 --> 01:19:03.261]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.864]  Many probiotics out there don't even have
[01:19:07.424 --> 01:19:07.765]  I think?
[01:19:25.447 --> 01:19:28.988]  Two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:35.030]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[01:19:35.491 --> 01:19:40.172]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[01:19:40.773 --> 01:19:49.796]  Whether it's Floralife, Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[01:19:50.908 --> 01:19:54.609]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[01:19:54.809 --> 01:20:02.632]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:20:06.313 --> 01:20:08.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.342 --> 01:20:31.445]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:33.727]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:46.077]  We're gonna have open phones coming up at the end of this hour into the entire third hour with Mike Adams, the health ranger, naturalnews.com.
[01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:52.842]  But let me tell you, he's got some of the most powerful sites out there, an amazing crew, offices in, you know, Asia, offices in the U.S.
[01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.783]  He has been global for a long time.
[01:20:55.304 --> 01:20:56.284]  And the same thing happened
[01:20:57.608 --> 01:20:59.019]  To you that happened to me before.
[01:21:00.086 --> 01:21:03.227]  We were under the radar and they would try to act like we weren't big and didn't have an audience.
[01:21:03.587 --> 01:21:04.387]  They already knew that.
[01:21:04.707 --> 01:21:08.289]  Then they started their attack because now they know they can't ignore us.
[01:21:08.389 --> 01:21:10.289]  And of course now they're coming after you worse than ever.
[01:21:10.749 --> 01:21:12.090]  The audience has to understand this.
[01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:14.870]  When he says he's bigger than CNN, you can look at the numbers.
[01:21:16.151 --> 01:21:21.633]  Before they changed the Alexa numbers to make it fraudulent, we were thousands of times bigger than MSNBC's website.
[01:21:22.053 --> 01:21:22.893]  They are frauds.
[01:21:22.933 --> 01:21:23.533]  They are jokes.
[01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:26.494]  This show has millions of listeners an hour confirmed.
[01:21:26.994 --> 01:21:29.255]  CNN, MSNBC don't have that combined.
[01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:32.776]  Okay, we had 86 million viewers and listeners the week of the election.
[01:21:33.116 --> 01:21:34.397]  That's double what it usually is.
[01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:35.597]  It's usually 40-something million.
[01:21:35.937 --> 01:21:43.740]  With all their censorship, through the last year, we're still at the same level, 40-something million a week, that actually listen, tune in, or watch us conservatively.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.161]  So despite everything they've thrown at us, we're still the same size.
[01:21:47.841 --> 01:21:53.663]  Despite all that, it's created a Streisand effect, so now they're filing a lawsuit a week against us, and even BuzzFeed
[01:21:54.503 --> 01:22:03.329]  And even major publications came out like Daily Beast and quoted lawyers that aren't even my fans going, this is very dangerous for you.
[01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:14.497]  These are 60, 70, 80 page demonization campaigns that talk about separate things that you say Jones did that, by the way, better be true because they're all quoting the defamation outside of court.
[01:22:14.557 --> 01:22:17.779]  You can file a document and have defamation in it and it's protected.
[01:22:18.079 --> 01:22:19.500]  That's what they're doing with these suits.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.462]  They put lies in a big report and the media puts it out that it's in a lawsuit.
[01:22:22.702 --> 01:22:27.809]  Alex, the strategy is just to occupy your time, your energy, and your money.
[01:22:28.289 --> 01:22:29.050]  That's the strategy.
[01:22:29.091 --> 01:22:30.232]  They know they can't win in court.
[01:22:30.993 --> 01:22:35.098]  They know that these will be dismissed, but you're going to have to pay a certain amount of money to have them dismissed.
[01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:40.065]  And they don't even care that there's slap provisions and they'll have to pay the money for the lawsuits at the end of the day.
[01:22:40.145 --> 01:22:42.587]  They've got unlimited funding to try to just destroy your life.
[01:22:42.927 --> 01:22:48.653]  Now look, I think part of the answer here, you know, Google banned naturalnews.com a year ago for six days.
[01:22:48.953 --> 01:22:53.537]  They made up a BS reason, total nonsense, technical reason, and then they restored it.
[01:22:54.158 --> 01:22:55.999]  YouTube banned my channel, you know, weeks ago.
[01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:59.803]  They haven't completely banned your channel yet, but they've been interfering with your live broadcasts.
[01:23:00.243 --> 01:23:04.167]  The answer to this, this deplatforming effort, is to build their own platforms.
[01:23:04.867 --> 01:23:06.208]  Like, you've got this operation.
[01:23:06.288 --> 01:23:07.808]  I've got an operation as well.
[01:23:08.088 --> 01:23:11.410]  I'm launching Reel.Video, as you know, which is going to carry InfoWars channels.
[01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.670]  Right.
[01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:15.251]  That system is being built to handle a billion video views a month.
[01:23:15.391 --> 01:23:16.252]  It's a serious effort.
[01:23:16.672 --> 01:23:19.593]  We're putting, we're committed over a million dollars into that effort.
[01:23:20.113 --> 01:23:22.214]  We've got over 16,000 people signed up for it right now.
[01:23:22.274 --> 01:23:27.616]  And by the way, all the guns and firearms companies are coming to us and requesting channels because they're all being banned off YouTube.
[01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:28.136]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:29.257]  Perfect name, everything.
[01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:34.600]  The answer is to build our own platforms, because there's a fragmentation of the internet.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:42.324]  YouTube is turning into a radical left-wing echo chamber, a bubble of fairy tales and delusional thinking.
[01:23:42.344 --> 01:23:48.707]  And notice, Facebook is too, and it's tanking their views, tanking their likes, tanking their traffic, and tanking their money.
[01:23:48.747 --> 01:23:51.889]  But they're still committed, even though they lost $40 billion the last month.
[01:23:52.409 --> 01:23:53.109]  Well, absolutely.
[01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:57.492]  And the reason, see, they would go after your advertisers, but you've got a product
[01:23:58.192 --> 01:23:59.413]  A base to offer.
[01:23:59.733 --> 01:24:15.224]  And by the way, this is something I didn't even mention, I was going to mention this, but one of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[01:24:15.864 --> 01:24:25.151]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:30.696]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:36.241]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads.
[01:24:36.261 --> 01:24:40.465]  The cobwebs go away and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[01:24:41.346 --> 01:24:46.067]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up and the nutrition to wake them up.
[01:24:46.087 --> 01:24:47.607]  I mean, the brain is a physical organ.
[01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:54.469]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[01:24:54.549 --> 01:24:55.389]  Here's my problem.
[01:24:55.849 --> 01:25:04.291]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear, I tend to get mad.
[01:25:04.311 --> 01:25:05.851]  I know, I have the same issue.
[01:25:06.111 --> 01:25:06.291]  Yeah.
[01:25:06.912 --> 01:25:08.292]  Because then you're just like, blah!
[01:25:09.973 --> 01:25:17.500]  But that's better than being in a coma, and they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:23.085]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[01:25:23.265 --> 01:25:26.789]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[01:25:27.069 --> 01:25:28.650]  We went out with the top labs.
[01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:31.032]  We want the strongest concentrate
[01:25:31.773 --> 01:25:45.724]  Of it out there, and Mike, you didn't, earlier in the break you said you were gonna, because you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products, you were saying that you really like bodies and you think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric, it's just incredible.
[01:25:46.024 --> 01:25:54.791]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[01:25:55.292 --> 01:25:55.832]  This is key.
[01:25:55.852 --> 01:25:57.754]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[01:25:58.334 --> 01:25:59.754]  And you have inflammation of the brain.
[01:25:59.794 --> 01:26:01.335]  They call that something down the road.
[01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:03.835]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[01:26:04.215 --> 01:26:05.816]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[01:26:05.876 --> 01:26:07.376]  They call that something else down the road.
[01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:12.837]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on, and they say, it's inflammation in the brain.
[01:26:13.198 --> 01:26:15.858]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[01:26:15.978 --> 01:26:16.658]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:19.599]  Now, your product is an extract.
[01:26:19.939 --> 01:26:22.660]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.321]  We've done over 1,000 foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[01:26:27.941 --> 01:26:31.165]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[01:26:31.505 --> 01:26:33.247]  The heavy metals stay in the root.
[01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:36.931]  So the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[01:26:36.971 --> 01:26:46.621]  Well, that's another reason that the top lab we ended up using to make this said that they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:47.161]  Exactly.
[01:26:47.282 --> 01:26:50.004]  So the other ones just grind up the root, it's got some heavy metal in it.
[01:26:50.044 --> 01:26:50.184]  Right.
[01:26:50.385 --> 01:26:51.005]  You don't want that.
[01:26:51.045 --> 01:26:52.026]  You want this extract.
[01:26:52.066 --> 01:26:52.727]  There's another factor.
[01:26:52.747 --> 01:26:53.908]  We have a microbiology lab.
[01:26:54.308 --> 01:26:58.613]  So we test everything for E. coli, Salmonella, and what's called a total plate count test.
[01:26:59.293 --> 01:27:05.840]  Turmeric root, the raw root, is one of the worst offenders in terms of total plate count and microbiology because it's grown in the soil.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.924]  When you do the extract, you leave all that behind as well, so you end up with a product that is really, really clean and pristine.
[01:27:12.404 --> 01:27:16.387]  And it concentrates the curcuminoids, which makes it more effective and more easily absorbed.
[01:27:16.647 --> 01:27:17.828]  You start to absorb it, frankly.
[01:27:18.468 --> 01:27:19.369]  These are capsules, right?
[01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:19.809]  Yes.
[01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:25.973]  I mean, I would say to people they should open up the capsule, put it in their mouth, and they would begin to... Oh, a tablet?
[01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:28.475]  Well, that... I mean... Yeah, you can show it.
[01:27:28.515 --> 01:27:29.056]  This is my drink.
[01:27:29.076 --> 01:27:29.336]  It's powder.
[01:27:29.356 --> 01:27:30.476]  This is American in my drink.
[01:27:30.517 --> 01:27:31.497]  I mean, you're obsessed with it.
[01:27:31.897 --> 01:27:34.940]  For five years I've seen you in here, at least every day at lunch, carrying those when you come over.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:35.200]  I know.
[01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:36.740]  Here, it's powdered.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:37.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:37.681]  No color.
[01:27:37.721 --> 01:27:38.742]  No coloring on it.
[01:27:38.762 --> 01:27:39.663]  Look how orange they are.
[01:27:39.703 --> 01:27:41.885]  Right, you should open them up and put them in your mouth.
[01:27:42.506 --> 01:27:44.568]  That's the most effective and rapid way to do it.
[01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:46.109]  Because then your saliva helps break it down more.
[01:27:46.249 --> 01:27:46.910]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:48.111]  And you start to absorb it immediately.
[01:27:48.852 --> 01:27:49.693]  Look how orange that is.
[01:27:50.233 --> 01:27:50.634]  Well, right.
[01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:55.779]  The curcuminoids... Most of them are like yellow or white and they're not even... it's just the root.
[01:27:55.819 --> 01:27:56.700]  This is concentrated.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:01.323]  And a lot of other companies they'll use like carrier junk stuff like corn maltodextrin from GMO corn.
[01:28:01.804 --> 01:28:07.448]  So they'll mix a little bit of this with like 10 times more corn filler, maltodextrin, or other kind of starch.
[01:28:07.468 --> 01:28:07.988]  And no filler here.
[01:28:08.128 --> 01:28:08.328]  Right.
[01:28:08.809 --> 01:28:16.955]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:21.817]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[01:28:22.398 --> 01:28:24.379]  Our world is more complex than ever before.
[01:28:24.679 --> 01:28:31.022]  The information coming at you, the attacks coming at you from multiple vectors are so complex, you need to have adaptogenic capabilities.
[01:28:31.042 --> 01:28:31.422]  No, it's true.
[01:28:31.482 --> 01:28:34.964]  I mean, one reason I've been more praised is I'm doing more of the juices.
[01:28:35.484 --> 01:28:35.924]  Good job.
[01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:38.466]  And I'm still doing bad stuff to myself, but I mean, it's helping me.
[01:28:38.766 --> 01:28:40.527]  Problem is, I drink juices, I get craved.
[01:28:41.047 --> 01:28:46.150]  Like, if I just have juice and work out like this morning, I come in here and my brain works better, but I'm bouncing off the walls.
[01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:49.671]  Hey, if I don't have superfoods, I can't function at the level I'm functioning at.
[01:28:50.071 --> 01:28:51.832]  Yeah, so we're not just here saying, hey, buy this.
[01:28:51.912 --> 01:28:53.653]  We're doing it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:53.693 --> 01:28:54.053]  We are.
[01:28:54.214 --> 01:28:56.275]  I mean, Mike more than me, and this guy's working 18 hours a day.
[01:28:56.495 --> 01:28:57.475]  We'll be back with the big news.
[01:28:57.495 --> 01:28:58.035]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:58.055 --> 01:29:04.599]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:04.939]  Go ahead.
[01:29:05.866 --> 01:29:07.747]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:29:07.787 --> 01:29:17.214]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:29:18.315 --> 01:29:21.657]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:29:22.137 --> 01:29:22.417]  Absolutely.
[01:29:44.888 --> 01:29:57.814]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:30:03.934 --> 01:30:08.315]  William Benning joins us to go over this with us right now.
[01:30:08.395 --> 01:30:19.338]  But again, there's the amazing cover sheet by the White House lawyer for the president saying we're ready to release more and to work with Congress to expose the full extent.
[01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:21.078]  This is just the beginning.
[01:30:21.158 --> 01:30:24.779]  So, Mr. Benning, you had said last Tuesday you hope this was just the beginning.
[01:30:25.639 --> 01:30:41.213]  And that you have been told that this larger memo investigation by the FISA court was one of the prime areas tying in and a nexus point of a third party, the judicial branch, now documenting what the executive and the legislative have found.
[01:30:43.327 --> 01:31:04.618]  That's right, and I think the more and more they go into it they're gonna find that the NSA is involved in this and that they need to look at what which names of people were unmasked through the NSA and which ones were targeted through their collection system and what what data they were using internally in the FBI and how they were using that data.
[01:31:05.402 --> 01:31:12.609]  That's really where criminality comes in, where you use these agencies against innocent or against U.S.
[01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:14.431]  citizens with no probable cause.
[01:31:15.332 --> 01:31:19.536]  That's a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment, and they shouldn't have been doing that anyway, and they know that.
[01:31:19.916 --> 01:31:21.758]  That's why they're trying to keep everything so secret.
[01:31:21.838 --> 01:31:27.684]  The first place I'd start is to go after the sworn affidavit that the FBI had to submit to the FISA court to get that warrant.
[01:31:28.648 --> 01:31:37.231]  That, of course, according to the memo, seemed to focus on the dossier, the Steele dossier, and that that was a false basis to begin with, and they knew that.
[01:31:37.651 --> 01:31:41.252]  And they didn't even talk about the DNC paying to have that done.
[01:31:41.732 --> 01:31:46.874]  So this is paid propaganda used to get a warrant in the FISA court to go after other people in another campaign.
[01:31:47.894 --> 01:31:49.455]  And then it means you have to go into the
[01:31:50.075 --> 01:31:58.001]  And into the unmasking by the White House of people who were in the Trump campaign to find out who they were targeting and what data they were getting and how they were using it.
[01:31:58.041 --> 01:31:59.122]  This is really a mess.
[01:31:59.502 --> 01:32:05.967]  I mean, it gets into the total subversion and sedition, basically, and treason against this country.
[01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:07.548]  I think we're in the... this is the break.
[01:32:07.608 --> 01:32:15.494]  And I think this break now is opening up the real rottenness in our government in Washington and in the agencies that make it up.
[01:32:16.472 --> 01:32:19.553]  And so this is where, this is where we really have to get to it.
[01:32:19.633 --> 01:32:21.814]  And it goes beyond like the FBI is the front.
[01:32:22.234 --> 01:32:26.635]  They take the flack from everybody because they figure they'll still survive because we need the FBI.
[01:32:27.235 --> 01:32:42.860]  But behind them are the supporting agencies like NSA and CIA and others who are actually helping them do and achieve what they want to do as a collective group of, I call them the Praetorian Guard, who will determine what our government does.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.001]  And so that's why they think they have so much power.
[01:32:46.041 --> 01:33:00.304]  Now we have to shine the light on and show them out for what they've been doing and hold those people who did it in those agencies accountable and make sure we carry through all the law and apply all the law equally to all of them.
[01:33:05.745 --> 01:33:08.386]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:27.355]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.813 --> 01:33:36.735]  By the way, during the break, Mike is obsessed with turmeric, as so many other people are.
[01:33:36.755 --> 01:33:37.815]  He's a leading expert in it.
[01:33:38.135 --> 01:33:39.896]  And how strong is that that you took?
[01:33:40.176 --> 01:33:41.676]  Oh, it's super potent.
[01:33:42.057 --> 01:33:43.277]  I mean, the taste is still there.
[01:33:43.577 --> 01:33:46.318]  Yeah, I was like, Alex, I want to taste some of this during the break.
[01:33:46.778 --> 01:33:48.239]  Look, this is a superfood.
[01:33:48.279 --> 01:33:50.699]  This has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years.
[01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:51.920]  It's been used in Chinese medicine.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:34:03.686]  In modern science, if you go on to the National Library of Medicine and you start searching for turmeric or curcumin, which is one of the phytochemicals in it, and you look at the medical research, it's tremendous.
[01:34:04.086 --> 01:34:05.407]  And we're covering some of this, by the way.
[01:34:05.427 --> 01:34:09.149]  We've got a website, Herbs.News, that talks... No, wait a minute.
[01:34:09.429 --> 01:34:10.330]  Turmeric.News.
[01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:11.771]  We have a website called Turmeric.News.
[01:34:12.031 --> 01:34:17.894]  People can read all about it, and that's what's in bodies, and it is super, super potent.
[01:34:18.094 --> 01:34:19.555]  We just publish all the science on it.
[01:34:20.615 --> 01:34:37.502]  And again, the FDA doesn't want people talking about it, even though folks need to know what's in the mainline science about Alzheimer's, what's in the mainline science about the things that are going on with all these neurological disorders, with migraines.
[01:34:37.562 --> 01:34:38.223]  It's all there.
[01:34:38.603 --> 01:34:40.403]  And as citizens, we have that free speech.
[01:34:41.164 --> 01:34:43.705]  If you think about it, you've got the cell phone assault.
[01:34:44.165 --> 01:34:46.145]  You have chemical assault.
[01:34:46.265 --> 01:34:47.626]  Yeah, look at those headlines on turmeric.news.
[01:34:47.886 --> 01:34:49.866]  Look, I have a massive team, as you know.
[01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:54.467]  We scour over 1,300 academic and science and medicine journals every day.
[01:34:54.787 --> 01:35:02.228]  And we find all the news on turmeric and blueberries and green tea and CBD oil, you know, hemp extracts.
[01:35:02.749 --> 01:35:04.849]  And by the way, don't get anybody high.
[01:35:05.309 --> 01:35:07.990]  It's on record they help with inflammation, help with all sorts of stuff.
[01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:08.610]  Absolutely.
[01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:09.830]  But they don't want you to have that.
[01:35:10.549 --> 01:35:12.551]  No, no, the whole system.
[01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:21.118]  It's just in the same way that they don't want you to have access to independent information, they also don't want you to have access to natural medicine, natural cures, foods and spices that are healing.
[01:35:21.538 --> 01:35:27.483]  You know, the official position of the FDA is that there's no such thing as a food that can prevent any disease, which is absolute nonsense.
[01:35:27.503 --> 01:35:30.165]  I mean, an orange will cure scurvy.
[01:35:30.305 --> 01:35:30.526]  Right.
[01:35:30.806 --> 01:35:32.908]  Yeah, I mean, and vitamin D cures rickets.
[01:35:33.168 --> 01:35:35.330]  You know, rickets is a disease of vitamin D deficiency.
[01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:36.651]  And you'll die without iodine.
[01:35:37.371 --> 01:35:37.872]  Absolutely.
[01:35:37.912 --> 01:35:39.353]  You'll die without calcium.
[01:35:39.373 --> 01:35:41.734]  You know, you'll die without many of these nutrients.
[01:35:41.754 --> 01:35:44.256]  Next they're going to say you can't say you must have oxygen to live.
[01:35:44.516 --> 01:35:45.077]  Right, right.
[01:35:45.317 --> 01:35:47.578]  Well, they'll tax you for it like Al Gore for exhaling.
[01:35:47.838 --> 01:35:51.421]  You know, oh, you breathe in oxygen and you created carbon dioxide.
[01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:53.322]  You're evil and you need to be depopulated.
[01:35:53.622 --> 01:35:56.024]  You know, that's their insane opinion.
[01:35:56.504 --> 01:35:57.925]  But look, the point is,
[01:35:59.173 --> 01:36:04.315]  You have to, if you're going to be part of this liberty movement of truth and transparency.
[01:36:04.335 --> 01:36:05.315]  You've got to be aggressive.
[01:36:05.716 --> 01:36:06.576]  You've got to be aggressive.
[01:36:06.596 --> 01:36:07.196]  You've got to be healthy.
[01:36:07.216 --> 01:36:08.336]  Stop negotiating with evil.
[01:36:08.937 --> 01:36:11.758]  Don't become a slave of the pharmaceutical cartels.
[01:36:12.578 --> 01:36:14.119]  Get off junk foods, everybody.
[01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:14.899]  Get off junk foods.
[01:36:14.959 --> 01:36:15.739]  Get off soda.
[01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:20.201]  Get off the addictive opioids and the addictive substances.
[01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:25.423]  Now you notice how California has required coffee companies to put a cancer warning on coffee.
[01:36:25.703 --> 01:36:26.943]  It's total nonsense.
[01:36:27.023 --> 01:36:28.424]  It's absolute nonsense.
[01:36:28.584 --> 01:36:32.466]  There's so many thousands of studies on coffee and preventing cancer.
[01:36:32.806 --> 01:36:40.710]  Coffee is one of the healthiest sources of liver-enhancing phytonutrients in the diet of the typical American.
[01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:44.912]  And by the way, the more cutting-edge medical doctors will even tell people with liver problems to drink coffee.
[01:36:45.073 --> 01:36:45.493]  Absolutely.
[01:36:46.293 --> 01:36:53.754]  Look, coffee has the bitters, as they're called in Chinese medicine or other forms of medicine, and the liver needs these bitters in order to function correctly.
[01:36:54.294 --> 01:36:58.215]  Our mainstream food diet has been stripped of all of the medicine.
[01:36:58.235 --> 01:37:02.296]  People want iceberg lettuce, not the bitter lettuce, which is actually more medicinal.
[01:37:02.696 --> 01:37:04.276]  Your salad should taste bitter.
[01:37:04.336 --> 01:37:05.136]  That's the medicine.
[01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:14.238]  But coffee brings you those bitters, as they're called, those alkaloids and other chemicals or phytochemicals that are very, very potent and enhance liver function.
[01:37:14.878 --> 01:37:17.299]  But my point, Alex, here is brain function.
[01:37:17.779 --> 01:37:27.302]  You can't process this information about what's happening in our world unless you have very adaptive and very responsive neurological and cognitive function.
[01:37:27.583 --> 01:37:31.104]  You have to be able to learn, remember information, the mainstream media,
[01:37:32.385 --> 01:37:35.108]  They want to make sure that people can't remember what they just reported yesterday.
[01:37:35.128 --> 01:37:36.350]  Well, that's what Gruber always said.
[01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:39.153]  He said, thank God we made their attention span seven seconds.
[01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:39.573]  Yes.
[01:37:39.974 --> 01:37:41.536]  And thank God they don't remember anything.
[01:37:41.576 --> 01:37:42.857]  Their whole thing is built on that.
[01:37:43.258 --> 01:37:44.759]  And I've always had a really, really great memory.
[01:37:44.779 --> 01:37:46.762]  As I've gotten older, it's not photographic anymore, but as I...
[01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:53.207]  Take the supplements as I take the bodies, turmeric, as I, you know, remember to take the X2 because there's a lot of stuff you got to take, a lot of supplements.
[01:37:53.488 --> 01:38:03.877]  If I remember to do more of the, you know, green drinks just from the local, you know, juice place, then I've got so much more energy, I'm so much more focused, I feel so much more better even though I work 18 hours a day.
[01:38:04.457 --> 01:38:11.143]  And they know that if they can convince you you have cancer, which is usually a fraud, the PSA test for prostate cancer for men is an absolute medical hoax.
[01:38:11.203 --> 01:38:12.004]  It's a complete fraud.
[01:38:12.344 --> 01:38:18.850]  But if they can scare you into it, and they can convince you to start undergoing chemotherapy, the number one side effect of chemotherapy is chemo brain.
[01:38:19.190 --> 01:38:20.411]  It damages your brain function.
[01:38:20.691 --> 01:38:25.335]  It also damages your heart, and your liver, and your kidneys, and it causes more cancer.
[01:38:25.736 --> 01:38:30.120]  The minute you undergo chemotherapy, you can no longer process information correctly.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.662]  Which is why, by the way, one of our Supreme Court justices... It's bug poison!
[01:38:34.042 --> 01:38:34.703]  It's poison.
[01:38:34.963 --> 01:38:36.464]  But she underwent chemotherapy.
[01:38:37.325 --> 01:38:37.705]  Ginsburg.
[01:38:38.526 --> 01:38:46.291]  And she should not be on the Supreme Court, in my opinion, because she has been cognitively impaired by toxic chemotherapy, which is based on chemical weapons.
[01:38:46.311 --> 01:38:48.653]  By the way, they're saying she hasn't known who she is for a while.
[01:38:49.372 --> 01:38:51.193]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:51.513 --> 01:38:55.354]  She's just trying to hang in there so she can keep, you know, the liberal agenda going.
[01:38:55.394 --> 01:39:05.616]  But we have people in Congress, people in the Senate, you know, Nancy Pelosi's famous for this, Hillary Clinton herself, who are cognitively so impaired they should be pulled out of public office.
[01:39:05.636 --> 01:39:10.698]  They are a disservice to our republic because they cannot make decisions in the interest of the people.
[01:39:11.238 --> 01:39:12.359]  They are so brain damaged.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:13.861]  They're on mass medications.
[01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:24.793]  There are pharmacies that feed pills to members of Congress and members of the Senate who are practically on chemical life support and they're the ones who are voting to take away our guns and take away our rights.
[01:39:26.314 --> 01:39:29.478]  They've all got their own bodyguards and what upsets me about all this is
[01:39:31.283 --> 01:39:40.186]  That clearly they're mentally ill, but then somebody like Soros, almost nine years old, who is just involved in all these attacks and all this disgusting behavior.
[01:39:41.246 --> 01:39:43.047]  Where do you think this fight's going overall?
[01:39:43.247 --> 01:39:45.788]  Well, they're in a desperate stage now, Alex.
[01:39:45.848 --> 01:39:52.730]  They are trying to destroy not only our First Amendment and Second Amendment rights, but destroy all of us who are pro-liberty.
[01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:54.110]  By the way, this isn't rhetoric.
[01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:55.130]  We're here.
[01:39:55.571 --> 01:39:56.351]  This is going on.
[01:39:57.191 --> 01:40:06.338]  We are receiving, you know, not just the normal death threats, but the kinds of tactics being used against us now are attempting to completely obliterate our existence.
[01:40:06.899 --> 01:40:07.940]  It's the same thing with Trump.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:19.348]  They're knocking on every door of anyone that ever bought a condo, anyone that ever rented a condo, anyone that plays golf at the golf course, harassing everyone, asking questions to everybody, asking for everybody's bank accounts, dragnetting everybody.
[01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:21.610]  Same thing to us, same thing to Paul Watson.
[01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.111]  It's just pure harassment.
[01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:24.452]  Yes, but these are desperate days.
[01:40:25.533 --> 01:40:28.155]  Their attempts of censorship come from their position of weakness.
[01:40:28.676 --> 01:40:33.699]  If they were really strong, they wouldn't mind our voices being out there because we would be unconvincing to people.
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:41.245]  The reason they're attacking you so much, Alex, is because you are making so much sense that you're awakening people to what's happening.
[01:40:42.166 --> 01:40:47.490]  You are a danger to their agenda, and to some extent I am as well, and that's why we're being so viciously attacked.
[01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:50.132]  But we have to recognize that that's from a position of weakness on their part.
[01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:51.391]  No, you're right.
[01:40:51.411 --> 01:40:56.793]  And what do you make of Trump meeting with Peter Thiel to begin the plan of who to target, who to break up?
[01:40:56.833 --> 01:40:58.094]  I mean, they're clearly monopolies.
[01:40:58.134 --> 01:40:59.875]  They advertise themselves as utilities.
[01:41:00.215 --> 01:41:01.395]  Now they're these giant censors.
[01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:04.637]  They're helping dictatorial regimes like China round up their own people.
[01:41:05.237 --> 01:41:09.399]  Twitter, Facebook, I mean, all of these groups are just terrible organizations.
[01:41:09.439 --> 01:41:13.420]  Well, Peter's going to have some really valuable input for President Trump, no doubt, on this point.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:17.002]  And these tech companies have become more powerful than governments.
[01:41:17.862 --> 01:41:32.769]  What I noticed is that the First Amendment was written to protect the right of free speech and religious expression from government oppression, but it did not encompass corporate attacks on free speech, because the Bill of Rights was written at a time when corporations were not more powerful than governments.
[01:41:32.829 --> 01:41:34.330]  It was government that was the greatest threat.
[01:41:35.137 --> 01:41:42.964]  So now, the First Amendment needs to be expanded to include large, dominant, corporate-run platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter, and others.
[01:41:43.044 --> 01:41:44.045]  That's where this needs to go.
[01:41:44.385 --> 01:41:48.629]  Well, I mean, it's the way the gay couple didn't get their cake baked, so they got $500,000.
[01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:53.613]  I think that's extreme, but I think if you're running a business, you know, unless something's profane or whatever, you should do it.
[01:41:54.674 --> 01:42:01.219]  How can they then censor all of us or censor stuff you did against genocide when they took your videos down and said you can't expose genocide?
[01:42:01.759 --> 01:42:07.924]  So again, they're a giant platform, they're a giant marketplace, and it's false advertising saying that you're welcome there but then you're not.
[01:42:08.697 --> 01:42:10.358]  Well, but they are losing so badly.
[01:42:10.378 --> 01:42:16.799]  Their strategy is going to lose because they, by de-platforming us, they force us to form our own platforms, like I already mentioned.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.460]  By attacking us, they energize us.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.441]  They motivate us.
[01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:28.443]  I have never been more dedicated to protecting liberty, not just for myself, Alex, but for supporting and protecting and providing... Oh, we're all in this together!
[01:42:28.863 --> 01:42:33.488]  So many other sites and people like, oh good, if Infowars gets shut down we'll have more traffic.
[01:42:33.528 --> 01:42:34.429]  That doesn't work like that.
[01:42:34.449 --> 01:42:35.710]  We're building the liberty movement.
[01:42:36.051 --> 01:42:38.493]  When I see somebody else being shut down or blocked, I feel it.
[01:42:38.874 --> 01:42:39.054]  Yes.
[01:42:39.094 --> 01:42:40.075]  Like I'm being stabbed.
[01:42:40.095 --> 01:42:40.916]  Somebody else is stabbed.
[01:42:40.936 --> 01:42:41.757]  And we want to help them.
[01:42:41.817 --> 01:42:42.718]  We want to give them a voice.
[01:42:42.778 --> 01:42:43.659]  Because they are us.
[01:42:43.979 --> 01:42:44.299]  That's right.
[01:42:44.339 --> 01:42:46.320]  And he's fools to understand that we the people.
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:47.080]  Exactly.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:53.824]  We're not collectivists, we're individualists, but we are collectively tied together and have to have collective action when we individually know it's the right thing to do.
[01:42:53.864 --> 01:42:56.805]  And that is the true collective, not the false collective.
[01:42:56.825 --> 01:42:57.425]  That's why we will win.
[01:42:57.645 --> 01:42:58.165]  That's why we'll win.
[01:42:58.185 --> 01:42:58.926]  We're the real collective.
[01:43:02.105 --> 01:43:02.445]  It spins.
[01:43:02.985 --> 01:43:04.446]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:45:03.339 --> 01:45:08.104]  Well, you know, the media has lied about me since the 1960s because I'm a hunter and I'm a gun advocate.
[01:45:08.644 --> 01:45:15.051]  And more and more people are waking up and getting wiser every day, and they're realizing what this fake news thing is all about.
[01:45:15.071 --> 01:45:20.597]  That's why Donald Trump is such an important guy, because he finally put the spotlight on the fake news cockroaches.
[01:45:20.997 --> 01:45:25.281]  And people are getting smarter all the time, and there's more and more support for truth, logic, and common sense.
[01:45:25.382 --> 01:45:26.523]  We celebrate it every damn day.
[01:45:32.668 --> 01:45:36.429]  I think most of the dirtbags on the left hate me because I'm so damn happy.
[01:45:37.269 --> 01:45:39.710]  I mean, I come out here and I got all these bows and arrows.
[01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:44.551]  I literally come out here every day and I take a pink arrow with my name on it.
[01:45:47.152 --> 01:45:49.633]  And I come out here with Chimane and we shoot our bows every day.
[01:45:49.693 --> 01:45:51.273]  We go to the range a lot.
[01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:54.674]  If you don't do it, you can learn something from Ted Nugent.
[01:45:54.754 --> 01:45:55.634]  It is the following.
[01:45:56.694 --> 01:45:58.255]  Get yourself a bow and arrow.
[01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:09.261]  And when you are looking at your target, and you're preparing to draw your bow, it goes all the way back to the origins of Zen.
[01:46:11.022 --> 01:46:23.312]  And the mystical flight of the arrow, right here, tunes out everything liberal, everything democratic, and you become the path of your arrow of life.
[01:46:23.632 --> 01:46:26.194]  I just hit the booger I was aiming at.
[01:46:26.334 --> 01:46:26.955]  Look out!
[01:46:27.135 --> 01:46:27.996]  Alex in the hole!
[01:46:29.215 --> 01:46:31.235]  And it's real touchy trigger, real touchy.
[01:46:31.255 --> 01:46:31.695]  I understand.
[01:46:31.775 --> 01:46:35.216]  Get that top pin in that top peep and squeeze.
[01:46:35.516 --> 01:46:36.016]  Nicely done.
[01:46:36.136 --> 01:46:39.257]  I'm usually dead on with a bow, but I'm actually sweating because Ted Nugent's watching.
[01:46:39.457 --> 01:46:41.677]  It's like guitars, women, and guns, man.
[01:46:41.757 --> 01:46:43.538]  It's got to be fit for you.
[01:46:44.138 --> 01:46:47.278]  All right, let's see.
[01:46:47.358 --> 01:46:47.658]  Okay.
[01:46:47.718 --> 01:46:51.219]  And just zero that in there and just squeeze that sumbitch.
[01:46:52.719 --> 01:46:53.319]  There you go.
[01:46:53.599 --> 01:46:54.480]  Double lungs, brother.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:55.400]  All right, good.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.460]  Back straps have landed.
[01:46:57.122 --> 01:46:58.282]  I'm Ted Nugent, full-time.
[01:46:58.462 --> 01:47:00.023]  Truth is viral.
[01:47:06.664 --> 01:47:09.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.525 --> 01:47:37.514]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:40.419 --> 01:47:42.142]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:42.542 --> 01:47:45.186]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:47:50.646 --> 01:47:52.347]  Alright, we're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:47:52.367 --> 01:47:55.368]  We want to hear from you on any subject we've raised, any topic you want to raise.
[01:47:55.408 --> 01:47:58.869]  Mike Adams, TheHealthRangerNaturalNews.com is here.
[01:47:58.889 --> 01:48:00.550]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:48:00.570 --> 01:48:03.951]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[01:48:03.991 --> 01:48:07.572]  And let's do first-time callers if they haven't done that in a few weeks.
[01:48:07.592 --> 01:48:08.172]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:48:08.952 --> 01:48:10.613]  I blew up in the first hour quite a bit.
[01:48:10.633 --> 01:48:11.513]  It had nothing to do with the crew.
[01:48:11.573 --> 01:48:12.954]  I kind of talked about some things there.
[01:48:12.974 --> 01:48:15.475]  Because Jordan Soros makes me so mad.
[01:48:16.095 --> 01:48:31.234]  That when I see Sink of the Young Turds and the Armenian Genocide Group, you can't make that up, against Christians, and I see CNN saying I'm a liar, I made it up that he was a Nazi collaborator, when he's on CBS saying it,
[01:48:32.236 --> 01:48:35.439]  It just shows you there's not anywhere they won't go.
[01:48:35.479 --> 01:48:38.221]  They are, they are so low, they are so out of control.
[01:48:38.241 --> 01:48:38.481]  877-789-2539.
[01:48:39.582 --> 01:48:44.345]  Now I should start these broadcasts with all the great clips the crew gets that are so amazing.
[01:48:44.706 --> 01:48:45.907]  So I want to start getting to some of these.
[01:48:47.045 --> 01:48:51.067]  Because we've got, you know, just so much here to cover.
[01:48:51.908 --> 01:48:56.351]  I wanted to get into George Ramos says Trump wants to make America white again.
[01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:57.351]  Tucker blows him away.
[01:48:57.371 --> 01:48:59.953]  Because it's the left pushing the race-based politics.
[01:49:00.293 --> 01:49:03.035]  We've got White House says they're about to announce when they're getting the troops out of Syria.
[01:49:03.055 --> 01:49:04.656]  That's a big thing that Trump's delivering on.
[01:49:05.316 --> 01:49:07.637]  We've got the YouTube Shooter Brothers says family warned police.
[01:49:07.657 --> 01:49:08.618]  Another stand down.
[01:49:09.399 --> 01:49:11.580]  YouTuber witness, I wish I'd had a gun.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.781]  Suspect in a YouTube shooting posted rants.
[01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:14.622]  I want to play some of that.
[01:49:15.322 --> 01:49:19.005]  We've got a bunch of these clips here that are really, really, really, really critical.
[01:49:19.926 --> 01:49:22.248]  But first off, getting to Trump, he's not a dictator.
[01:49:22.268 --> 01:49:23.729]  I'm not saying I want him to be a dictator.
[01:49:23.929 --> 01:49:25.210]  The media always says that when I say that.
[01:49:25.731 --> 01:49:34.458]  He's having to work with Congress and everybody else, but he gave them a reasonable DACA that he said he supported during the campaign of people that have been here decades and, you know, don't have a criminal record.
[01:49:35.419 --> 01:49:36.921]  Yeah, we'll fast-track you to citizenship.
[01:49:37.382 --> 01:49:37.962]  I'm for that too.
[01:49:37.982 --> 01:49:38.984]  A lot of great people.
[01:49:39.905 --> 01:49:47.314]  We got people that are here legally on, you know, student visas from Mexico that work here, that now have their degrees and are, you know, working here and they do it all legally.
[01:49:47.334 --> 01:49:48.455]  They're great people, doing a great job.
[01:49:48.475 --> 01:49:48.715]  Boom!
[01:49:48.996 --> 01:49:53.281]  Some of them have been only here a couple years and are already doing management stuff because they're smart, hard-working people.
[01:49:53.541 --> 01:49:53.782]  Boom!
[01:49:53.902 --> 01:49:54.162]  You're in.
[01:49:55.043 --> 01:50:01.152]  But if you've had four or five times you've been deported, DWI or armed robbery, your ass isn't coming back.
[01:50:01.733 --> 01:50:03.676]  And the next time you come here, you're going to get five years in prison.
[01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:05.659]  And that's only reasonable.
[01:50:05.719 --> 01:50:06.840]  So Mike Adams is here.
[01:50:08.274 --> 01:50:09.474]  With us breaking all this down.
[01:50:09.494 --> 01:50:17.997]  But notice Trump, for all the fair-weather patriots that got so mad at him, and Coulter who likes to, you know, be the guardian of everything and pull stunts.
[01:50:18.057 --> 01:50:18.797]  And I'm not against her.
[01:50:18.817 --> 01:50:20.798]  It's good to have somebody keeping people honest.
[01:50:20.818 --> 01:50:22.498]  But with Trump, that's not what's happening.
[01:50:23.079 --> 01:50:25.259]  Now he rejects all DACA because they weren't reasonable.
[01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:27.960]  He's gonna put troops on the border until the wall's built.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.781]  It's the best idea ever.
[01:50:30.121 --> 01:50:31.521]  Which is exactly what everybody always said.
[01:50:31.561 --> 01:50:32.162]  It's common sense.
[01:50:32.442 --> 01:50:33.742]  That's what the military's supposed to be.
[01:50:34.142 --> 01:50:36.003]  So he's talking about having a press conference and a
[01:50:37.045 --> 01:50:40.286]  This is the inside baseball argument from a high-level White House source two weeks ago.
[01:50:40.546 --> 01:50:41.647]  I didn't want to say it at the time.
[01:50:41.987 --> 01:50:43.107]  Now I know it's about to come out.
[01:50:43.167 --> 01:50:47.589]  I wasn't told don't talk about it, but they said just don't even mention the White House until later.
[01:50:47.809 --> 01:50:48.829]  Well, now is the time to do it.
[01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:54.832]  And they're going to have this parade, and it's going to be celebrating pulling troops out of several countries.
[01:50:55.432 --> 01:50:56.272]  And I can tell you that.
[01:50:56.312 --> 01:50:57.093]  They're just waiting.
[01:50:57.393 --> 01:50:58.653]  Trump's pushing the Pentagon to do it.
[01:50:58.673 --> 01:50:59.974]  So we're going to have this parade.
[01:51:00.814 --> 01:51:09.379]  And then, we're going to deploy a large portion of those folks, and they're going to rotate through, so they get time with their family for a few months, and then rotate back and forth.
[01:51:09.399 --> 01:51:14.762]  You're going to have rotations, and you're going to end up having a permanent military force on the border, which is in the Constitution.
[01:51:15.062 --> 01:51:18.484]  So, boom, there it is, total delivery of what Trump said he would do.
[01:51:18.744 --> 01:51:22.506]  China's almost $900 billion, and I know your wife's from that area, so you're an expert.
[01:51:22.526 --> 01:51:24.367]  You have businesses outside China.
[01:51:24.407 --> 01:51:26.188]  Taiwan, by the way, not as common as China.
[01:51:26.208 --> 01:51:27.149]  As I was saying, nearby, yeah.
[01:51:27.529 --> 01:51:28.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:47.287]  He's a counterpuncher.
[01:52:06.368 --> 01:52:11.492]  California is destroying our nation from within by allowing illegals to openly cross the border.
[01:52:11.512 --> 01:52:13.414]  They are the drawbridge blown off the hinges.
[01:52:13.895 --> 01:52:21.141]  They're giving them voting rights and then they're voting for California senators and members of Congress who are then dictating federal law to the entire country.
[01:52:21.741 --> 01:52:32.691]  California needs to be, if they're not going to fix up and clean up their voting, they need to be denied all senators and members of Congress as far as I'm concerned because those are not elected by American people.
[01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:39.933]  We need to start clamping down on this and we need to protect the borders and stop the invasion of America.
[01:52:39.973 --> 01:52:41.634]  That's what Trump is willing to do.
[01:52:41.774 --> 01:52:45.435]  And again, it's a UN-directed global out... This is a 21st century war.
[01:52:45.796 --> 01:52:46.396]  This is a war.
[01:52:46.476 --> 01:52:47.096]  We're in a war.
[01:52:47.136 --> 01:52:52.498]  I'm not saying I'm like a military charging machine gun nest, but this is 21st century war where they're going to attack your family.
[01:52:52.698 --> 01:52:53.418]  They're going to attack you.
[01:52:53.438 --> 01:52:54.559]  They're going to pour coffee on you.
[01:52:54.719 --> 01:52:55.939]  They're going to shoot you sometimes.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:00.721]  The left, if you've not seen, I'm not going to name names, but they're all over leftist media going,
[01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:02.722]  Alex Jones' son is a captive.
[01:53:03.142 --> 01:53:04.143]  He's brainwashed.
[01:53:04.683 --> 01:53:05.884]  He doesn't need to be on air.
[01:53:05.944 --> 01:53:06.884]  We're concerned about it.
[01:53:06.904 --> 01:53:12.048]  They're all for their own young people being anti-gun, but because he's pro-gun, they want him off the air.
[01:53:12.068 --> 01:53:16.830]  And then they say things like, well, Jones got his start in Sinclair Broadcasting.
[01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:18.571]  It's that whole thing about them scripting things.
[01:53:18.631 --> 01:53:24.115]  But I've never been on one Sinclair station, not one Sinclair station of those TV stations.
[01:53:24.415 --> 01:53:25.876]  That is fundamentally lies.
[01:53:25.896 --> 01:53:26.816]  But that's what the media does.
[01:53:27.096 --> 01:53:28.377]  They just push total lies.
[01:53:28.717 --> 01:53:29.558]  How insane is it
[01:53:30.018 --> 01:53:36.443]  That they accuse your son of being brainwashed when he is pro-human rights, which is the right of self-defense.
[01:53:36.483 --> 01:53:37.844]  It is a natural divine right.
[01:53:38.405 --> 01:53:40.366]  And Rex is pro-human rights.
[01:53:40.627 --> 01:53:42.288]  That's the natural state of things.
[01:53:42.588 --> 01:53:48.953]  And then you have David Hogg, who is obviously being practiced and rehearsed in debate tactics.
[01:53:49.033 --> 01:53:50.835]  I wasn't in the room when Rex shot those videos.
[01:53:51.896 --> 01:53:54.177]  I was on air, he taped them and they're exactly David Hogg.
[01:53:54.197 --> 01:53:55.418]  You're not feeding him lines.
[01:53:55.859 --> 01:53:58.261]  But David Hogg is being fed lines, very clearly.
[01:53:58.321 --> 01:53:59.121]  It's obvious.
[01:53:59.482 --> 01:54:00.483]  You talk about being brainwashed.
[01:54:00.503 --> 01:54:06.187]  Bill Gates says we need to use mosquitos with pathogens in them to lower population.
[01:54:06.207 --> 01:54:10.371]  He said that at TED TV, to lower the population growth to zero.
[01:54:12.381 --> 01:54:15.243]  Why is Hogg stating an exterminist, eugenic statement?
[01:54:15.343 --> 01:54:18.604]  Yeah, well, we know why, but hey, there's a caller.
[01:54:18.804 --> 01:54:19.425]  First time caller.
[01:54:19.465 --> 01:54:19.985]  We're going to go to him.
[01:54:20.005 --> 01:54:21.846]  We're going to start the next hour, but I've got to ask you this, Mike.
[01:54:21.886 --> 01:54:22.446]  Mike loves the calls.
[01:54:22.466 --> 01:54:23.206]  We're going to do it, I promise.
[01:54:23.226 --> 01:54:23.947]  I do like the calls.
[01:54:23.967 --> 01:54:27.868]  I've got to ask you, because I promise.
[01:54:29.449 --> 01:54:30.590]  Why is the left so desperate?
[01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:32.030]  You were saying they're going to break because we're winning.
[01:54:33.131 --> 01:54:35.192]  They know that the only way they can defeat us is to break our will.
[01:54:36.392 --> 01:54:41.336]  And these campaigns that target you and me are actually mental terrorism.
[01:54:41.416 --> 01:54:43.978]  They are torment campaigns to break your will.
[01:54:44.478 --> 01:54:45.659]  They know they can't break your opposition.
[01:54:45.699 --> 01:54:46.319]  But it's the opposite.
[01:54:46.359 --> 01:54:47.940]  I've got so much energy now.
[01:54:48.221 --> 01:54:50.042]  I'm so honored to be... I'm not just saying that.
[01:54:50.242 --> 01:54:51.923]  They don't get it because they're all selfish people.
[01:54:52.143 --> 01:54:52.344]  Right.
[01:54:52.404 --> 01:54:54.005]  They don't get that this is a real honor.
[01:54:54.245 --> 01:54:59.569]  They think that we are weaklings like they are because that's all they're surrounded with is weak, pathetic people.
[01:54:59.989 --> 01:55:01.911]  That's who they are, their left-wing cult.
[01:55:02.172 --> 01:55:03.694]  They're not used to meeting strength.
[01:55:03.954 --> 01:55:08.619]  They're not used to somebody standing up and asserting their right to exist as a conscious human being.
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:16.429]  They're not used to somebody saying, I have the right to defend not only my person, my property, my family, but my country, this republic.
[01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:18.971]  Must be defended, and we have that right as well.
[01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:23.635]  And they've known that the West has had that spirit particularly strong, and that's why they're trying to crush it.
[01:55:23.695 --> 01:55:34.904]  They're trying to stamp out that individual spirit that is the fire of the Promethean energy of all the technology and everything else, and it's only a byproduct of that spirit that all human groups have, but it's particularly strong in the West.
[01:55:34.964 --> 01:55:35.204]  Why?
[01:55:35.824 --> 01:55:41.289]  And spiritually, if you give in to the left, you fail the divine test of this life.
[01:55:41.549 --> 01:55:42.250]  You fail God.
[01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:46.512]  If you give in and you surrender... By the way, I've known you for 10 years or longer, 12 years.
[01:55:46.552 --> 01:55:50.753]  You didn't used to be this... I mean, what was the metamorphosis of you, knowing it's spiritual?
[01:55:51.614 --> 01:56:00.538]  It's a realization that you come to when you are in the center of these attacks, you begin to see the seething evil and the demonic forces that are targeting you.
[01:56:00.558 --> 01:56:02.078]  And you see it jump into people.
[01:56:02.158 --> 01:56:02.518]  You do.
[01:56:02.538 --> 01:56:04.619]  It's like Agent Smith jumps... That's right.
[01:56:04.699 --> 01:56:06.420]  Olay will be there and he goes, I'm gonna get you.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.761]  And they walk into another hall and another one goes, that's right, we hear it.
[01:56:08.801 --> 01:56:10.522]  And it's like, how are they even communicating?
[01:56:10.882 --> 01:56:11.062]  Right.
[01:56:11.102 --> 01:56:12.443]  You're like, was this a space invader?
[01:56:12.503 --> 01:56:14.104]  I mean, I'm telling you, man, it's Twilight Zone.
[01:56:14.204 --> 01:56:15.805]  Well, I mean, the Pope.
[01:56:15.865 --> 01:56:16.686]  Look at this Pope.
[01:56:17.066 --> 01:56:18.947]  He is an agent of Satan.
[01:56:19.288 --> 01:56:20.148]  I mean, I have to say it.
[01:56:20.188 --> 01:56:23.090]  I know it's controversial, but he's an agent of Satan.
[01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:25.271]  Satan has taken over this Vatican.
[01:56:25.292 --> 01:56:27.313]  It hasn't been that way, you know, in previous Popes.
[01:56:27.333 --> 01:56:28.554]  They're making their move right now.
[01:56:28.814 --> 01:56:29.434]  It's this one.
[01:56:29.694 --> 01:56:29.955]  Yes.
[01:56:30.355 --> 01:56:31.676]  I mean, look at what he promotes.
[01:56:32.296 --> 01:56:35.157]  Destructive, anti-life ideas, anti-liberty.
[01:56:35.417 --> 01:56:36.817]  You know, liberty is a divine right.
[01:56:36.877 --> 01:56:38.117]  God wants you to be free.
[01:56:38.377 --> 01:56:40.538]  And he can't help it, even though he'll get destroyed doing it.
[01:56:40.798 --> 01:56:43.799]  He's just recklessly trying to break the church up.
[01:56:44.019 --> 01:56:45.799]  And the members were good.
[01:56:45.839 --> 01:56:48.000]  The church has had corruption problems for a long time, obviously.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.961]  But the people, on average, were pro-family, pro-God, pro-life.
[01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:53.261]  And he's saying, no, no, no, no.
[01:56:53.401 --> 01:56:55.842]  Open your borders, lower your drawbridges, get rid of your family.
[01:56:56.122 --> 01:56:57.062]  Christ is not real.
[01:56:57.082 --> 01:56:58.322]  I don't want to hear about Christianity.
[01:56:59.022 --> 01:57:00.963]  I don't want to hear about, you know, there is no hell.
[01:57:01.543 --> 01:57:07.768]  And it's sitting there attacking the very... If you want to go be an atheist and say there's no hell, that's fine, Pope, but you're not the Pope!
[01:57:07.788 --> 01:57:13.412]  The key is, when you look at some of these people like that, you have to realize they're not fully qualified human beings.
[01:57:13.772 --> 01:57:16.454]  They are demons occupying human bodies.
[01:57:16.474 --> 01:57:20.057]  It's like Brian Stelter and others, and the Pope, they all have this...
[01:57:21.417 --> 01:57:21.698]  They do.
[01:57:21.718 --> 01:57:24.199]  I mean, what does that look?
[01:57:24.699 --> 01:57:26.580]  They're not human beings inside anymore.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:27.120]  That's the thing.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.202]  Literally, the soul has been replaced.
[01:57:30.302 --> 01:57:32.103]  It's been drained out and replaced.
[01:57:32.303 --> 01:57:33.063]  And you're a scientist.
[01:57:33.083 --> 01:57:34.464]  I mean, you're a top engineer.
[01:57:34.944 --> 01:57:36.785]  I am a scientist.
[01:57:36.845 --> 01:57:38.906]  And you should not believe this stuff, but now you've seen it.
[01:57:38.926 --> 01:57:39.246]  I see it.
[01:57:39.487 --> 01:57:40.447]  I see it happening.
[01:57:40.567 --> 01:57:41.147]  It is real.
[01:57:41.207 --> 01:57:42.368]  The spiritual war is here.
[01:57:42.708 --> 01:57:43.449]  No question about it.
[01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.929]  It's here.
[01:57:45.214 --> 01:57:46.078]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:57:46.178 --> 01:57:48.146]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:57:48.488 --> 01:57:49.211]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:49.251 --> 01:57:49.954]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.994 --> 01:57:50.697]  We'll take your phone calls.
[01:57:53.436 --> 01:57:58.420]  Support this network, and not only support us, but trigger the verified libtards on Twitter.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.202]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[01:58:01.282 --> 01:58:07.267]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[01:58:07.287 --> 01:58:09.629]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[01:58:09.789 --> 01:58:17.976]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April, and they found it like it was some secret, and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[01:58:18.056 --> 01:58:20.918]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[01:58:21.338 --> 01:58:31.003]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:34.345]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[01:58:34.445 --> 01:58:42.149]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:43.209]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:45.351]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[01:58:45.391 --> 01:58:46.591]  It was hilarious.
[01:58:48.512 --> 01:58:50.713]  They wrote it at vice.com!
[01:58:50.833 --> 01:59:00.639]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley take some kind of new trophy.
[01:59:00.679 --> 01:59:03.080]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:10.104]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[01:59:10.124 --> 01:59:12.345]  I'm gonna go after Joe Rogan too.
[01:59:13.528 --> 01:59:19.813]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[01:59:19.873 --> 01:59:22.015]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:23.516]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[01:59:23.596 --> 01:59:23.857]  Good.
[01:59:24.097 --> 01:59:25.418]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[01:59:25.578 --> 01:59:30.282]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[01:59:30.582 --> 01:59:32.664]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[01:59:33.104 --> 01:59:35.445]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[01:59:35.785 --> 01:59:38.705]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[01:59:38.725 --> 01:59:40.266]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[01:59:40.346 --> 01:59:41.226]  BrainForce Plus.
[01:59:41.286 --> 01:59:44.267]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:44.407 --> 01:59:51.368]  And now, get BrainForce Plus at 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:51.649 --> 02:00:00.391]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:13.378 --> 02:00:17.244]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[02:00:17.825 --> 02:00:21.070]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:50.123 --> 02:00:54.027]  There's this joker face that the globalists make and their minions make.
[02:00:54.208 --> 02:01:07.282]  We pull Brian Stelter or pull up Wolf or pull up the Pope and when I showed this look where they don't realize how crazy they look and I can't even make the face exactly but it's this.
[02:01:09.445 --> 02:01:11.346]  They said, oh my God, you're attacking Jews.
[02:01:11.867 --> 02:01:15.249]  And I didn't even think Brian Stelter was Jewish or the Pope's not Jewish.
[02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:21.353]  And they just injected that in on the Young Turks and CNN and everywhere that I was attacking Jews.
[02:01:21.393 --> 02:01:22.534]  Well, Brian Stelter's not even Jewish.
[02:01:22.554 --> 02:01:23.315]  I actually looked it up.
[02:01:23.355 --> 02:01:24.436]  I didn't think that.
[02:01:25.036 --> 02:01:26.157]  That isn't a Jewish look.
[02:01:26.177 --> 02:01:26.557]  That's a...
[02:01:28.396 --> 02:01:29.877]  Jack Nicholson style look.
[02:01:29.917 --> 02:01:31.377]  I mean, it's a look.
[02:01:31.698 --> 02:01:34.459]  And it's like people in these cults have that look.
[02:01:34.479 --> 02:01:36.120]  You know, it's the subway guy look.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:36.520]  Yeah.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.221]  And there's just something predatory.
[02:01:38.241 --> 02:01:39.481]  The eyes have it.
[02:01:39.881 --> 02:01:40.522]  Absolutely.
[02:01:41.182 --> 02:01:43.903]  Webster Hubble's daughter, Chelsea Clinton has it.
[02:01:44.523 --> 02:01:45.404]  Pennywise has it.
[02:01:45.424 --> 02:01:46.945]  I'm not saying Pennywise is Jewish.
[02:01:47.645 --> 02:01:49.126]  I thought it was an interdimensional spider.
[02:01:49.286 --> 02:01:51.827]  But what do you call that look?
[02:01:53.275 --> 02:01:54.656]  Demonic, to me.
[02:01:54.676 --> 02:02:06.244]  I mean, look, it's a predatory look, like you said, but it's someone who knows that they're seething with evil on the inside and they are enjoying it because that's what they're working for.
[02:02:06.264 --> 02:02:07.224]  They're working for evil.
[02:02:07.945 --> 02:02:11.747]  That's why I say, as a mantra here, almost stop negotiating with evil.
[02:02:12.308 --> 02:02:16.751]  We are not here to get along with these radical left-wing evil operators.
[02:02:17.271 --> 02:02:18.332]  We are here to defeat them.
[02:02:18.892 --> 02:02:19.272]  Exactly.
[02:02:19.333 --> 02:02:23.136]  They think when they intimidate us or attack us or do something to us that we're losing.
[02:02:23.196 --> 02:02:27.199]  We're getting stronger to the point that I can hardly contain it in the first hour.
[02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:28.220]  I'm so angry at them.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.281]  It's the opposite.
[02:02:29.401 --> 02:02:30.662]  I've never felt stronger.
[02:02:30.742 --> 02:02:32.864]  I've never wanted to be anywhere else.
[02:02:32.884 --> 02:02:35.346]  But now it's just unbelievable.
[02:02:35.406 --> 02:02:41.431]  As they turn up the evil against us, God, the real force in the universe, turns it back up on them.
[02:02:41.471 --> 02:02:43.493]  And it's like, I don't know how much more of this I can handle.
[02:02:44.192 --> 02:02:50.817]  Well, they've done a deal with the devil, so to speak, and they gain power from their evil and how many other people they destroy.
[02:02:50.837 --> 02:02:55.161]  I mean, look at who promotes those news networks like CNN.
[02:02:55.581 --> 02:02:59.024]  Pharma companies, big pharma companies that poison people's minds.
[02:02:59.104 --> 02:03:00.205]  Meanwhile... Soul killers!
[02:03:00.465 --> 02:03:01.085]  You are here...
[02:03:01.866 --> 02:03:10.310]  Promoting products that enhance nutrition, that clean water, that boost cognitive function, that prevent issues that people might be dealing with.
[02:03:10.610 --> 02:03:11.810]  You know, just think about it.
[02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:17.913]  What funds CNN is pharmaceutical money based on human lab rat experiments?
[02:03:17.933 --> 02:03:18.553]  That's their main funder.
[02:03:18.574 --> 02:03:19.354]  Human experimentation.
[02:03:19.414 --> 02:03:22.655]  And then they demonize us selling high quality products.
[02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:23.376]  Exactly.
[02:03:23.436 --> 02:03:24.196]  It's so insane.
[02:03:24.216 --> 02:03:28.598]  By the way, now that Bezos bought up Whole Foods, it's reported, they're lowering the quality to pure crap.
[02:03:28.618 --> 02:03:29.839]  Oh, I have no doubt about it.
[02:03:29.859 --> 02:03:30.219]  I won't even...
[02:03:30.939 --> 02:03:32.100]  Go near Whole Foods anymore.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.481]  But think about this.
[02:03:33.721 --> 02:03:39.645]  You know, a decade ago, who was promoting holistic health and food?
[02:03:40.145 --> 02:03:41.726]  It was mostly progressives.
[02:03:42.467 --> 02:03:43.848]  And now today, what are they promoting?
[02:03:44.548 --> 02:03:46.089]  SB 277 in California.
[02:03:46.369 --> 02:03:48.110]  State Senator Richard Pan in California.
[02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:49.691]  Mandatory vaccines.
[02:03:49.771 --> 02:03:51.753]  Inject all the children with these toxic metals.
[02:03:52.073 --> 02:03:57.436]  We have a letter from the Secretary of Health of California saying, oh, we ran out of the mercury-free vaccines for children.
[02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.558]  Shoot them up with the mercury vaccines.
[02:04:00.768 --> 02:04:03.431]  This is part of the plan, Alex.
[02:04:04.052 --> 02:04:08.757]  It 100% causes an autoimmune response and massive swelling in the brain and lowering of IQ.
[02:04:09.317 --> 02:04:11.219]  And we wonder why people are getting Alzheimer's at 30.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.787]  Look, we know, we know how to set people free and it comes with nutrition and information.
[02:04:17.827 --> 02:04:18.748]  It's both of those hand in hand.
[02:04:18.768 --> 02:04:20.790]  Well, you know, it was Rob Dew about two years ago, it was Alex.
[02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:21.350]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.890 --> 02:04:39.990]  That was something obviously even stronger, but theirs is great as well.
[02:04:40.651 --> 02:04:42.171]  And it is just next level.
[02:04:42.191 --> 02:04:43.091]  So I'm going to stop plugging.
[02:04:43.431 --> 02:04:44.411]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:04:44.691 --> 02:04:47.332]  Bodies is 25% off back in stock, and you help fund the First Amendment.
[02:04:47.672 --> 02:04:49.212]  But just try it for yourself.
[02:04:49.593 --> 02:04:51.353]  Also try our pollen block.
[02:04:51.673 --> 02:04:52.333]  It's incredible.
[02:04:53.073 --> 02:04:53.913]  Now we're going to come back.
[02:04:54.013 --> 02:04:55.214]  Patrick's calling from Australia.
[02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:56.494]  Wants to defend my son Rex.
[02:04:56.794 --> 02:05:00.455]  That all these Lepus publications are calling for him to be removed from the air.
[02:05:00.475 --> 02:05:00.875]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.600]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:07.361]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:07.781 --> 02:05:10.681]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:05:11.721 --> 02:05:22.763]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:05:23.203 --> 02:05:32.325]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:05:32.805 --> 02:05:38.372]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:05:38.592 --> 02:05:43.759]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:05:44.039 --> 02:05:46.001]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:05:46.302 --> 02:05:48.324]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:05:49.582 --> 02:05:52.386]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:05:52.607 --> 02:05:53.989]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:57.194]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:05:57.936 --> 02:05:59.919]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.724]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com
[02:06:20.999 --> 02:06:27.083]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:27.503 --> 02:06:28.984]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:35.772 --> 02:06:43.141]  We're going right to Patrick and Desiree and others that are patiently holding, bam, bam, bam, with the amazing Mike Adams.
[02:06:43.161 --> 02:06:44.903]  He was on fire four or five years ago.
[02:06:44.923 --> 02:06:46.485]  He said, listen, I'm not doing all interviews anymore.
[02:06:46.505 --> 02:06:49.048]  I'm going to build my lab, launch a bunch of websites, launch it.
[02:06:49.088 --> 02:06:51.130]  And he just went from one level to even more.
[02:06:51.150 --> 02:06:52.552]  And now he's like, I'm ready to come back on.
[02:06:52.572 --> 02:06:53.133]  And it's like,
[02:06:53.613 --> 02:06:54.754]  He's born again hard.
[02:06:54.814 --> 02:07:01.660]  He was already hard against the Globalists, but it's that Full Metal Jacket term that he definitely has the gear to take on the Globalists.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:02.641]  It only makes me feel good.
[02:07:02.661 --> 02:07:05.904]  That's the thing about Globalists and Minions and Devil Worshippers and these people.
[02:07:06.164 --> 02:07:08.106]  They hate anybody else that's smart or strong.
[02:07:08.407 --> 02:07:09.267]  It makes them feel weak.
[02:07:09.608 --> 02:07:10.989]  I feel stronger having Mike Adams.
[02:07:11.349 --> 02:07:12.730]  I feel stronger having Donald Trump.
[02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:13.911]  I feel strong seeing you.
[02:07:14.312 --> 02:07:15.913]  I feel strong having Rand Paul.
[02:07:16.013 --> 02:07:20.677]  I feel strong with Owen Schroer and David Knight, in many cases, doing a better show than I do.
[02:07:20.937 --> 02:07:26.622]  I feel strong knowing DrugsReport.com is 50 times bigger than Infowars and the biggest thing in the world.
[02:07:27.003 --> 02:07:28.664]  That makes me feel strong at night.
[02:07:28.684 --> 02:07:31.166]  It doesn't make me feel weak that, oh, he's bigger than me.
[02:07:31.427 --> 02:07:33.088]  I'm like, thank God there's people stronger.
[02:07:33.188 --> 02:07:34.469]  Right, I feel exactly the same way.
[02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:39.153]  All of us who are defending liberty, we have to help each other.
[02:07:39.694 --> 02:07:45.258]  We have to recognize the importance of defending each other against these vicious, malicious attacks.
[02:07:45.839 --> 02:07:51.664]  And that's why I've done some of those articles, by the way, on you and some of the, like the whole Atrazine issue.
[02:07:52.044 --> 02:07:56.888]  What you say about Atrazine turning frogs gay is actually mainline science.
[02:07:57.409 --> 02:07:59.170]  It is, I did a whole story of all the studies.
[02:07:59.250 --> 02:08:00.111]  It's been that for 30 years.
[02:08:01.352 --> 02:08:03.055]  It's widely recognized science.
[02:08:03.135 --> 02:08:08.001]  People who make fun of you on that, they are making fun of themselves because they are so scientifically illiterate.
[02:08:08.121 --> 02:08:09.683]  But the truth is, they know it's real.
[02:08:09.944 --> 02:08:10.865]  They're there to make a joke.
[02:08:10.885 --> 02:08:12.767]  I notice every time Corbett attacks, it's that.
[02:08:13.942 --> 02:08:17.145]  And it's all about, oh, no one's changing, or if... Hogg came out and attacked us.
[02:08:17.685 --> 02:08:18.486]  It's a talking point.
[02:08:18.526 --> 02:08:23.650]  They do not want people to discuss why women are becoming hyper-feminized and men are becoming feminized.
[02:08:23.670 --> 02:08:23.990]  That's right.
[02:08:24.090 --> 02:08:24.390]  That's right.
[02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:27.472]  The metro-sexual agenda.
[02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.434]  Instead, they push it as a victory.
[02:08:30.054 --> 02:08:30.635]  They do.
[02:08:30.995 --> 02:08:34.978]  They want to destroy men, they want to destroy families, they want to destroy Christians and others.
[02:08:34.998 --> 02:08:36.700]  But I know you want to go to the call, so... We're going to do it.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.021]  I've just got to get this press release out.
[02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:39.812]  I'm going to D.C.
[02:08:39.972 --> 02:08:43.296]  I'll be there Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and we've got some surprises in store for folks.
[02:08:43.396 --> 02:08:44.418]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:08:44.478 --> 02:08:53.028]  And pray for us because we have to go into the deepest parts of Mordor and I'm going to be doing some things that I may be able to talk about later where I have to face true evil in person.
[02:08:53.608 --> 02:08:54.890]  Okay, so I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:58.614]  But Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered.
[02:08:59.648 --> 02:09:03.211]  Alex Jones, the whole press conference against Soros-backed lawsuits.
[02:09:03.932 --> 02:09:12.719]  And, you know, I can just tell you, I don't turn down these meetings because I learned a lot of stuff previously at meetings with similar people, not this high level.
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.582]  But if the globalists want to meet with me,
[02:09:17.666 --> 02:09:21.068]  To talk parlay, I'm going to meet with him.
[02:09:21.489 --> 02:09:23.890]  By the way, I've already told him I'm not coming and I'm not going to make any agreements.
[02:09:24.471 --> 02:09:26.772]  So, I mean, I'm not just going there for a press conference.
[02:09:27.013 --> 02:09:27.693]  So pray for us.
[02:09:27.733 --> 02:09:31.155]  This is not something I enjoy doing, but I feel really strong doing it.
[02:09:31.416 --> 02:09:32.757]  Give him hell, Alex.
[02:09:32.857 --> 02:09:33.417]  That's what I say.
[02:09:33.497 --> 02:09:35.418]  If they want to meet, we're going to meet with them.
[02:09:35.458 --> 02:09:37.860]  Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered.
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.121]  Alex Jones to hold press conference.
[02:09:39.141 --> 02:09:40.382]  I just want to look him in the eyes.
[02:09:41.914 --> 02:09:42.154]  Yeah.
[02:09:42.254 --> 02:09:44.315]  Democrat plan to repeal First Amendment discovered.
[02:09:44.755 --> 02:09:47.617]  Alex Jones to hold press conference against Soros-backed lawsuits.
[02:09:49.157 --> 02:09:50.718]  And Hillary-funded lawsuits, I could add.
[02:09:50.878 --> 02:09:55.861]  On Tuesday, April 10th, Alex Jones with Crew will make a statement and take questions from the press in Washington, D.C.
[02:09:55.901 --> 02:10:00.143]  I'll have some lawyers there on the anti-free speech lawsuits targeting his First Amendment rights.
[02:10:00.163 --> 02:10:01.823]  Some of these are the top lawyers of the First Amendment.
[02:10:02.504 --> 02:10:04.224]  The National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[02:10:04.625 --> 02:10:06.425]  Zinger Room, 9 a.m.
[02:10:06.445 --> 02:10:08.186]  It'll go for three hours, 529 14th Street.
[02:10:10.047 --> 02:10:10.287]  I think so.
[02:10:40.548 --> 02:10:46.212]  The Daily Caller and the Free Beacon and Washington Times.
[02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:50.615]  Yeah, and a whole bunch of other folks have already called, so they're obviously all going to get in first.
[02:10:50.896 --> 02:10:52.197]  We're going to let fake media in, too.
[02:10:52.657 --> 02:10:59.442]  We want to spar with them and see what they're going to try to do, because we're going to be live-streaming the whole thing at Infowars.com forward slash show, so look for that.
[02:10:59.802 --> 02:11:00.983]  So, that is very exciting.
[02:11:01.124 --> 02:11:02.585]  And I'm just doing that while I'm there.
[02:11:05.409 --> 02:11:09.572]  Face off with the eye of Mordor on Monday and then also on Wednesday.
[02:11:09.592 --> 02:11:19.638]  But like I said, people say, why in the world before would you meet with some top syndicators who offer you a million a year, three million a year, and then ten million a year to sell out book deals?
[02:11:20.078 --> 02:11:21.519]  Right before Beck showed up, it was Beck's deal.
[02:11:22.059 --> 02:11:23.460]  And then they said, you're the one we want you.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.721]  And then there was real contracts.
[02:11:25.002 --> 02:11:25.502]  And I said, no.
[02:11:25.522 --> 02:11:27.504]  And over the next two years, it went up to $10 million a year.
[02:11:28.024 --> 02:11:29.786]  And because they can see what's going to happen.
[02:11:30.466 --> 02:11:31.887]  And I didn't take that.
[02:11:31.947 --> 02:11:32.648]  We've changed the world.
[02:11:32.668 --> 02:11:33.249]  And thank God I didn't.
[02:11:33.269 --> 02:11:34.029]  It wasn't even a choice.
[02:11:34.049 --> 02:11:36.551]  Because they said, by the way, kid, we're going to control what you say.
[02:11:36.571 --> 02:11:37.332]  But it's going to be all right.
[02:11:37.352 --> 02:11:41.295]  You're going to have a great time and live in LA or New York, wherever you want, where you want to live.
[02:11:41.336 --> 02:11:44.979]  And then I have these guys going, look, Jones, I don't get paid $10 million a year.
[02:11:45.219 --> 02:11:46.520]  Almost no one else does but Limbaugh.
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:47.761]  So this is your deal.
[02:11:47.861 --> 02:11:48.422]  We're going to do it.
[02:11:49.082 --> 02:11:50.904]  And it's, you need to do it right now.
[02:11:51.164 --> 02:11:56.648]  But it had like moral clauses in it too where they would say, oh, look, you didn't do good with your sponsor.
[02:11:56.688 --> 02:11:58.770]  You're off the air and you can't work for two years.
[02:11:58.810 --> 02:11:59.870]  It was all golden handcuffs.
[02:12:00.211 --> 02:12:02.112]  I could see it was a spider weaving a web for me.
[02:12:02.172 --> 02:12:05.675]  But now, all this time later, it really feels good to have not sold out.
[02:12:05.795 --> 02:12:07.496]  Yeah, but they're going to keep trying.
[02:12:07.736 --> 02:12:16.023]  But I know you and being here in person with you and being on a similar battle path, you cannot be bought with money.
[02:12:16.303 --> 02:12:17.804]  You are so far beyond that.
[02:12:17.844 --> 02:12:18.905]  This is a spiritual war.
[02:12:18.925 --> 02:12:19.966]  You're fighting for your soul.
[02:12:19.986 --> 02:12:21.247]  You're fighting for the liberty of our country.
[02:12:21.587 --> 02:12:23.709]  No one can buy you or me off with money.
[02:12:23.909 --> 02:12:24.409]  Can't happen.
[02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:25.850]  Doesn't matter how big the check is.
[02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:26.731]  Can't happen.
[02:12:27.051 --> 02:12:29.133]  I know they've offered you a lot.
[02:12:29.293 --> 02:12:34.357]  They've offered me, you know, $10 million, which is a pittance now compared to what our... That seems to be their ballpark.
[02:12:34.697 --> 02:12:35.217]  Yeah.
[02:12:35.297 --> 02:12:36.959]  And it's actually the real deal.
[02:12:37.299 --> 02:12:38.040]  Contract, real deal.
[02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:42.381]  A lot of them know some other folks, what they've offered is even more.
[02:12:43.001 --> 02:12:43.442]  It's getting crazy.
[02:12:43.462 --> 02:12:44.543]  Oh yeah, that was several years ago.
[02:12:44.963 --> 02:12:48.647]  I mean, now they know nothing's for sale, you know, because I'm not selling my soul.
[02:12:48.667 --> 02:12:50.969]  I told these people, I said, why do you want to meet?
[02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:55.173]  Well, we know you think you don't want to hear this, but you really need to see what we're going to show you.
[02:12:55.413 --> 02:12:55.813]  Oh yeah?
[02:12:56.554 --> 02:12:56.774]  Really?
[02:12:56.854 --> 02:12:57.835]  I actually want to see this!
[02:12:57.855 --> 02:12:58.876]  What are they going to show you?
[02:12:59.377 --> 02:13:01.258]  Like aliens from planet Zorg?
[02:13:04.492 --> 02:13:05.593]  Is the Pope going to be there?
[02:13:05.633 --> 02:13:08.075]  Is he going to have inner demons come out and try to shake your hand?
[02:13:08.095 --> 02:13:08.455]  I don't know, man.
[02:13:08.475 --> 02:13:09.096]  What's going on?
[02:13:09.116 --> 02:13:12.798]  I was talking to this one guy in the CIA, and he told me this story.
[02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:14.499]  Well, they took him in this room.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:17.742]  Anyways, I'll leave it right there.
[02:13:18.082 --> 02:13:21.004]  But let's go ahead and go to Patrick in Australia.
[02:13:21.084 --> 02:13:22.545]  Patrick, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:13:22.565 --> 02:13:23.186]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:23.386 --> 02:13:23.966]  Thanks for calling.
[02:13:23.986 --> 02:13:24.367]  God bless.
[02:13:24.387 --> 02:13:24.687]  Go ahead.
[02:13:26.328 --> 02:13:27.649]  Yeah, no worries, mate.
[02:13:27.909 --> 02:13:31.712]  Before I talk about Hogg v. Jones, I want to talk about your toothpaste.
[02:13:32.381 --> 02:13:35.371]  I bought ten tubes in March of last year.
[02:13:35.712 --> 02:13:37.758]  I had two taken off me at the airport.
[02:13:37.778 --> 02:13:39.483]  I gave two away.
[02:13:40.169 --> 02:13:42.611]  And six tubes still lasted me a year.
[02:13:42.651 --> 02:13:46.254]  Now, I know it's hard to get excited about toothpaste, but it is great stuff.
[02:13:46.574 --> 02:13:49.377]  And, folks, will you just at least buy the toothpaste?
[02:13:49.997 --> 02:13:50.518]  It's amazing.
[02:13:50.718 --> 02:13:51.759]  It is concentrated.
[02:13:51.779 --> 02:13:53.440]  There's all these fillers in other toothpaste.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:59.365]  And we were formulating with the top company, the top company that makes organic in the country, and they said, well, you're not going to put all product in it?
[02:13:59.405 --> 02:13:59.986]  No filler?
[02:14:00.626 --> 02:14:01.967]  And it is really strong.
[02:14:02.428 --> 02:14:04.689]  And sometimes I mix it with another toothpaste because it's so strong.
[02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:07.612]  But the point is, is it really is good with silver and iodine.
[02:14:07.632 --> 02:14:08.733]  So thank you for supporting us, sir.
[02:14:10.103 --> 02:14:10.403]  No.
[02:14:10.803 --> 02:14:16.445]  Now, regarding Hogg v. Jones, it's literally the archetypal battle that you're always talking about.
[02:14:16.545 --> 02:14:31.831]  It's the chicken-neck, control freak, loser, wannabe socialist dictator against the strong, Christian, athletic, pro-gun, pro-responsibility, pro-accountability guy, because that's what the liberty movement's about.
[02:14:32.131 --> 02:14:33.432]  You know, it's not for free.
[02:14:33.452 --> 02:14:35.693]  The cost of liberty is responsibility.
[02:14:36.093 --> 02:14:39.094]  And that's a check the leftists don't want to write, let alone cash.
[02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.930]  That's a great point.
[02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:45.332]  I mean, what people said online was, you look at Rex, he's already 6'1".
[02:14:45.793 --> 02:14:47.514]  His arms are almost as big around as I am.
[02:14:47.554 --> 02:14:49.876]  He punches, you know, he likes to trade punches sometimes.
[02:14:49.896 --> 02:14:51.537]  I mean, he wrestles really good.
[02:14:51.557 --> 02:14:52.278]  He's in jiu-jitsu.
[02:14:52.618 --> 02:14:55.441]  And I'm like, man, this model might be better than the last model.
[02:14:55.461 --> 02:14:56.461]  I hope he eclipses me.
[02:14:56.802 --> 02:14:59.404]  But to see the left everywhere going, get him off the air!
[02:14:59.704 --> 02:15:00.305]  Take him off!
[02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:01.566]  Alex brainwashed him.
[02:15:01.766 --> 02:15:02.646]  We're worried about him.
[02:15:02.967 --> 02:15:04.248]  Alex works for Sinclair.
[02:15:05.128 --> 02:15:06.850]  Whatever the latest buzz is, they just say it.
[02:15:08.072 --> 02:15:09.773]  Yeah, it's out of control, insane.
[02:15:10.214 --> 02:15:13.756]  I'm impressed with Rex's cognitive grasp of the issues.
[02:15:13.796 --> 02:15:14.957]  I mean, he's only 15, right?
[02:15:15.097 --> 02:15:15.297]  Yes.
[02:15:15.717 --> 02:15:17.439]  And he's way ahead of his years.
[02:15:17.459 --> 02:15:17.819]  15 and a half.
[02:15:18.359 --> 02:15:24.364]  And he's not being fed lines like David Hogg is obviously rehearsing with debate people, you know.
[02:15:26.587 --> 02:15:31.050]  I'm not even gonna... I'll get in trouble if I keep talking about Hogg, but... God, you can't.
[02:15:31.230 --> 02:15:31.690]  No, I know.
[02:15:32.491 --> 02:15:34.352]  He's a public figure, he can tell us to F off.
[02:15:34.632 --> 02:15:35.593]  Patrick, thank you for the support.
[02:15:35.613 --> 02:15:37.314]  I know it's expensive to ship stuff to Australia.
[02:15:37.554 --> 02:15:42.157]  We're trying to do a deal in Australia and in England to make it cheaper in Europe with the shipping, and over in Australia.
[02:15:42.177 --> 02:15:43.177]  As you know, that's a huge market.
[02:15:43.197 --> 02:15:43.958]  We're trying to do that.
[02:15:44.278 --> 02:15:45.779]  Thank you so much, and God bless you, Patrick.
[02:15:46.179 --> 02:15:48.881]  But the most important thing people can do is not just financially support us.
[02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:50.482]  It's print up on little cards.
[02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:51.503]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:52.443]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:52.843 --> 02:15:54.144]  The most hated name, you know...
[02:15:55.525 --> 02:15:56.386]  People the globalists hate.
[02:15:56.866 --> 02:15:58.867]  It's your word of mouth, they can't stop.
[02:15:59.207 --> 02:16:00.047]  You are who they fear.
[02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:06.270]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewall.
[02:16:06.951 --> 02:16:08.332]  It's very, very affordable.
[02:16:08.872 --> 02:16:11.573]  At $29.95, it's 25% off out of the gates.
[02:16:12.113 --> 02:16:18.196]  And we set out with beta-glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:22.599]  We can even make claims about what this does to
[02:16:23.459 --> 02:16:29.467]  Bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling, or you're under stress, or it's in the winter months.
[02:16:30.028 --> 02:16:32.291]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[02:16:32.351 --> 02:16:37.317]  Wellmune is patented and documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[02:16:38.239 --> 02:16:39.200]  And then you got the Ancient.
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:43.481]  It's all there ladies and gentlemen and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:09.331]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing.
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:12.472]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle.
[02:17:12.552 --> 02:17:13.952]  And a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:18.634]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[02:17:19.214 --> 02:17:25.556]  They said on average about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:40.725]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered to actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, uh, and several other things.
[02:17:41.045 --> 02:17:46.367]  And I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good, good, good claim records.
[02:17:46.647 --> 02:17:49.208]  And then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[02:17:49.268 --> 02:17:49.528]  I mean, I...
[02:17:50.583 --> 02:17:55.147]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[02:17:55.187 --> 02:17:56.709]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:17:56.729 --> 02:17:58.631]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:17:58.651 --> 02:18:00.532]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:18:00.552 --> 02:18:03.475]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[02:18:04.656 --> 02:18:06.238]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:18:06.758 --> 02:18:08.360]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:10.382]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:18:11.590 --> 02:18:14.733]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:15.634]  This is insane.
[02:18:16.075 --> 02:18:17.016]  Wow, it's incredible.
[02:18:17.036 --> 02:18:19.078]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[02:18:19.599 --> 02:18:20.440]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:21.821]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[02:18:21.861 --> 02:18:26.826]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and in the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[02:18:26.927 --> 02:18:27.868]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[02:18:28.508 --> 02:18:29.649]  And they're all game changers.
[02:18:29.689 --> 02:18:34.513]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[02:18:35.114 --> 02:18:39.278]  Our average review on InfoWarsTore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[02:18:39.998 --> 02:18:48.606]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them going, we want to see it, it must be fake.
[02:18:48.626 --> 02:18:50.787]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.981]  So, they've got campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[02:18:56.021 --> 02:19:05.825]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it in California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[02:19:06.165 --> 02:19:12.187]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[02:19:12.487 --> 02:19:14.948]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[02:19:14.968 --> 02:19:16.869]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know,
[02:19:17.529 --> 02:19:18.510]  10-15 ingredients in it.
[02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:20.351]  It's also a large serving like caveman.
[02:19:20.671 --> 02:19:26.814]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[02:19:26.934 --> 02:19:27.675]  It's just insane.
[02:19:28.115 --> 02:19:31.256]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[02:19:31.276 --> 02:19:33.658]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:34.218 --> 02:19:38.322]  But thank you for committing to get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:19:38.682 --> 02:19:41.304]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:19:41.324 --> 02:19:48.151]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films, and you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:19:48.171 --> 02:19:51.273]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:19:51.614 --> 02:19:53.015]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:19:54.897 --> 02:19:56.718]  That's available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:20:06.149 --> 02:20:08.870]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:18.174 --> 02:20:22.476]  Mike Adams is here!
[02:20:27.336 --> 02:20:33.542]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:33.642 --> 02:20:33.983]  It is!
[02:20:34.964 --> 02:20:36.825]  And again, sounds egomaniac.
[02:20:36.845 --> 02:20:38.667]  The intros come in every time and say, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:38.707 --> 02:20:40.669]  The radio stations want that for the Arbitron ratings.
[02:20:41.109 --> 02:20:41.810]  That's for radio.
[02:20:41.850 --> 02:20:44.232]  This is a radio show that morphs into television.
[02:20:44.833 --> 02:20:49.455]  In the last 20 years, and we're here, we pioneered this, and we're honored all you helped fund this.
[02:20:49.795 --> 02:21:06.921]  We've got Desiree, and we're going to Jennifer who disagrees, Jeff, Carlos, Kent, Mike, James, but NaturalNews.com's your flagship, but you've got your big testing facility, you've got, I'm always looking at these amazing sites with amazing news and links to amazing studies, and I go, oh, it's Mike Adams, oh, it's Mike Adams.
[02:21:07.301 --> 02:21:08.462]  How many sites do you have?
[02:21:10.853 --> 02:21:14.815]  We run over 300 different sites on different topics.
[02:21:14.835 --> 02:21:16.955]  A lot of them are real small, like blueberries.news.
[02:21:17.496 --> 02:21:19.676]  It's a site about blueberry science and nutrition.
[02:21:20.917 --> 02:21:21.737]  Herbs.news.
[02:21:21.857 --> 02:21:27.039]  Yeah, but we also run liberty.news, guns.news, tyranny.news, you know, freedom.
[02:21:27.899 --> 02:21:36.902]  Lots of themed sites and then we syndicate our own stories to these hundreds of different sites and we have our own, you know, journalism team and so on.
[02:21:36.922 --> 02:21:38.023]  So we're very, very strong.
[02:21:38.143 --> 02:21:39.183]  By the way, I've done some
[02:21:39.423 --> 02:21:43.566]  Cracking just your top 10 sites together is way bigger than CNN.com.
[02:21:43.826 --> 02:21:44.266]  Absolutely.
[02:21:44.667 --> 02:21:45.907]  Yeah, there's no question about it.
[02:21:46.408 --> 02:21:53.973]  But the thing is, you know, we have scientific research and medical research on so many of our stories.
[02:21:54.033 --> 02:21:55.654]  By the way, I've got a Smith & Wesson Model 10.
[02:21:55.694 --> 02:21:57.215]  Oh yeah, there we go.
[02:21:57.235 --> 02:21:57.535]  Guns.News.
[02:21:57.735 --> 02:22:03.639]  But I've got a Spanish ripoff of it that my grandfather had that he got, I guess, during World War II that he brought back.
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:05.641]  And it's just an awesome gun.
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:06.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:11.222]  Well, we run gear.news, which is all about survival gear, and then we run survival.news.
[02:22:11.282 --> 02:22:12.142]  I could just go on and on.
[02:22:12.262 --> 02:22:14.123]  Why do they love Will Smith and Wesson Model 10?
[02:22:14.903 --> 02:22:15.663]  Well, it's just simple.
[02:22:15.703 --> 02:22:17.524]  It doesn't jam, because it's not a semi-auto.
[02:22:18.564 --> 02:22:25.606]  And who was that liberal who said that her bodyguards don't have semi-auto weapons?
[02:22:25.626 --> 02:22:26.246]  Yeah, a bunch of them.
[02:22:27.447 --> 02:22:27.847]  Who was it?
[02:22:29.548 --> 02:22:30.568]  Oh, Chelsea Handler.
[02:22:30.588 --> 02:22:30.828]  Yeah.
[02:22:31.088 --> 02:22:33.809]  What, are all her bodyguards carrying Model 10 revolvers?
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:40.763]  I guess they don't even know what guns are, they don't even know how they work, but now we're guilty of gunsplaining.
[02:22:41.423 --> 02:22:43.544]  So you see how crazy it gets.
[02:22:43.964 --> 02:22:57.491]  But anyway, our job, see we used to be attacked all the time for saying, oh we're anti-science because we're talking about turmeric or blueberries or things that can prevent cancer, other foods, so we just
[02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:02.072]  We built a massive team to look at all the science and bring it together and back it up.
[02:23:02.493 --> 02:23:04.854]  Now, we are Science.News.
[02:23:05.275 --> 02:23:06.716]  We are Medicine.News.
[02:23:06.856 --> 02:23:15.301]  We have the best publication of science-backed, journal-backed evidence to support Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:23:15.321 --> 02:23:17.383]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:23:17.483 --> 02:23:18.023]  All these things.
[02:23:18.043 --> 02:23:20.365]  Yeah, see Vitamin D right there on Science.News today.
[02:23:21.005 --> 02:23:22.466]  Absolute fact, you need that.
[02:23:23.106 --> 02:23:25.887]  People ask why everybody's getting the flu during the winter, because you don't have vitamin D, you don't get sun.
[02:23:26.007 --> 02:23:30.609]  Yeah, vitamin D and zinc can basically prevent the flu in almost every single case.
[02:23:30.949 --> 02:23:35.411]  And by the way, that's mainline science, but no one will tell you because there's no money in that.
[02:23:35.491 --> 02:23:35.831]  That's right.
[02:23:36.332 --> 02:23:37.212]  They want to brain damage you.
[02:23:37.232 --> 02:23:38.072]  Okay, we're going to go to the calls.
[02:23:38.092 --> 02:23:38.453]  We're bad.
[02:23:38.473 --> 02:23:41.214]  Desiree, then we're going to go to Jennifer and Kent and Carlos.
[02:23:41.734 --> 02:23:43.595]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[02:23:43.615 --> 02:23:43.875]  Go ahead.
[02:23:46.468 --> 02:23:50.371]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[02:23:50.511 --> 02:23:55.435]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[02:23:55.455 --> 02:24:10.708]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your full spiel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[02:24:11.292 --> 02:24:12.713]  I'm a nurse here in California.
[02:24:12.733 --> 02:24:16.714]  I've been a nurse here doing hospice and working with geriatrics for over 15 years.
[02:24:17.474 --> 02:24:23.456]  I see an epidemic of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, thyroid disease, autoimmune disorder.
[02:24:23.596 --> 02:24:26.177]  It is just absolutely crazy.
[02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:28.018]  Mental disease.
[02:24:28.458 --> 02:24:30.559]  My husband has an autoimmune disorder.
[02:24:30.599 --> 02:24:31.919]  He's had it for over 15 years.
[02:24:31.959 --> 02:24:32.779]  Sorry about that.
[02:24:32.799 --> 02:24:37.421]  We started using your products and I am amazed at the results.
[02:24:37.561 --> 02:24:39.962]  His pain, he's reduced his opioid use.
[02:24:40.402 --> 02:24:43.163]  His thyroid medication has went severely down.
[02:24:43.183 --> 02:24:47.024]  He's almost back to the man that I married.
[02:24:47.685 --> 02:24:50.506]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[02:24:51.166 --> 02:24:54.787]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[02:24:54.907 --> 02:24:57.368]  I use your winter sun, your selenium.
[02:24:57.968 --> 02:25:04.493]  The real red pill, your bio PCA, true selenium, cell force, immune wall.
[02:25:04.673 --> 02:25:07.975]  My husband's been immunosuppressant for years.
[02:25:08.015 --> 02:25:10.077]  He can't go into town without getting sick.
[02:25:10.377 --> 02:25:11.698]  He doesn't do that anymore.
[02:25:12.899 --> 02:25:17.622]  I'm just here in California fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[02:25:18.003 --> 02:25:19.764]  How they're demonizing my state.
[02:25:19.824 --> 02:25:21.225]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[02:25:21.966 --> 02:25:23.347]  You have changed my life.
[02:25:23.428 --> 02:25:26.210]  Info Wars has changed my family's life.
[02:25:26.711 --> 02:25:32.297]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[02:25:32.357 --> 02:25:36.881]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[02:25:37.759 --> 02:25:39.060]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[02:25:39.260 --> 02:25:44.564]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[02:25:44.584 --> 02:25:48.708]  I think she should just share her testimony, but also pray.
[02:25:48.888 --> 02:25:49.608]  She's on track.
[02:25:49.969 --> 02:25:50.729]  Absolutely.
[02:25:51.890 --> 02:25:53.571]  And again, I'm the one that sits there.
[02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:58.897]  And like an enforcer with my children giving them the products and everybody says, why are your children glowing?
[02:25:59.338 --> 02:26:00.359]  Why do they all look like this?
[02:26:00.719 --> 02:26:03.082]  Women come over and say, hey, is this your brother?
[02:26:03.102 --> 02:26:05.845]  I mean, I have like 20 year old women come up and start asking my son out.
[02:26:06.085 --> 02:26:06.686]  He's 15.
[02:26:06.926 --> 02:26:08.468]  He looks like he's 18, especially in person.
[02:26:08.488 --> 02:26:09.129]  He looks even older.
[02:26:09.369 --> 02:26:09.989]  That's him in person.
[02:26:10.009 --> 02:26:10.589]  He's a bruiser.
[02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:12.630]  And it's like, what are you feeding this kid?
[02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:14.791]  Well, he's taking a good multivitamin.
[02:26:14.811 --> 02:26:15.931]  That's not even one of our products.
[02:26:15.951 --> 02:26:16.311]  We should.
[02:26:16.351 --> 02:26:17.852]  He takes the fruit punch that is ours.
[02:26:18.432 --> 02:26:19.212]  He takes the X2.
[02:26:19.412 --> 02:26:20.393]  He takes the vitamin B12.
[02:26:20.853 --> 02:26:22.453]  I mean, he takes a lot of the products.
[02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:24.234]  And now he's the one that's into them.
[02:26:24.274 --> 02:26:24.574]  He does.
[02:26:24.634 --> 02:26:26.034]  And my daughters, I still have to push it on them.
[02:26:26.294 --> 02:26:29.255]  But then I remember when I'm sitting there in the morning, I go, wait, I'm not taking these myself.
[02:26:29.756 --> 02:26:30.436]  I've got to take them.
[02:26:30.456 --> 02:26:32.897]  But when I do take it, it's a whole nother world.
[02:26:32.937 --> 02:26:33.837]  I mean, just take fish oil.
[02:26:34.137 --> 02:26:35.117]  We don't have our own fish oil yet.
[02:26:35.157 --> 02:26:35.637]  It's coming out.
[02:26:35.657 --> 02:26:36.838]  We've got a really clean one about to come out.
[02:26:37.782 --> 02:26:44.326]  The point is, I take fish oil, I'm exhausted and it's midnight, I'm doing Coast to Coast AM or some other show, or one of the kids doesn't feel well and is up.
[02:26:45.207 --> 02:26:49.890]  I will, like, eat six fish oils and in 20 minutes I'm high off of them.
[02:26:49.970 --> 02:26:52.252]  I mean, it's like, and I don't even have a fish oil yet.
[02:26:52.292 --> 02:26:54.053]  It's like, this stuff really works, man.
[02:26:54.233 --> 02:26:55.174]  It's what we're built to eat.
[02:26:55.194 --> 02:26:57.755]  I mean, I remember as a kid, I'd go, man, I had crazy dreams last night.
[02:26:57.795 --> 02:26:59.436]  My mom would say, well, yeah, we're at the coast.
[02:26:59.656 --> 02:27:00.697]  We just caught fresh fish.
[02:27:00.937 --> 02:27:02.979]  You just ate like a pound of mahi-mahi, son.
[02:27:03.799 --> 02:27:07.441]  I mean, fish oil makes your blood flow much more efficiently.
[02:27:07.461 --> 02:27:09.141]  It's less viscous because of fish oils.
[02:27:09.881 --> 02:27:16.404]  And what's happening, literally, in your body is that as those fish oils are absorbed, the blood is getting into cells that have been more stagnant.
[02:27:16.984 --> 02:27:21.386]  And so you are feeling it, you are seeing it, but it's also working in your brain as well as other parts of your body.
[02:27:21.406 --> 02:27:23.567]  Exactly, and again, we don't even have a fish oil yet.
[02:27:23.687 --> 02:27:25.788]  I'm just saying it's one of the, I think it's one of the top things.
[02:27:25.808 --> 02:27:26.188]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:27:26.208 --> 02:27:28.729]  Just like, I take turmeric, X2 fish oil, it's like...
[02:27:29.449 --> 02:27:31.290]  I can be depressed every once in a while.
[02:27:31.350 --> 02:27:32.951]  My grandmother died and I was really depressed for a few days.
[02:27:32.971 --> 02:27:40.875]  I went, wait a minute, a bunch, and it wasn't placebo, I ate a bunch of fish oil, took some turmeric, this was just last year, took some extra X2, and I was like, wow, I feel great, why didn't I do this?
[02:27:41.316 --> 02:27:42.996]  Yeah, it's just amazing to me.
[02:27:43.477 --> 02:27:45.358]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[02:27:45.398 --> 02:27:46.238]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[02:27:46.258 --> 02:27:47.959]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[02:27:47.979 --> 02:27:48.940]  We really appreciate you.
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:50.501]  Keep up the fight.
[02:27:50.521 --> 02:27:51.821]  We need to take California back.
[02:27:51.841 --> 02:27:52.201]  Thank you, Desiree.
[02:27:52.221 --> 02:27:53.442]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[02:27:53.482 --> 02:27:54.082]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:27:54.102 --> 02:27:54.823]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:27:55.569 --> 02:27:57.430]  I was just saying, get that fish oil going.
[02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:58.911]  I can't find a good one.
[02:27:59.091 --> 02:28:02.974]  And also, my husband wants you to listen to a song by Ice-T.
[02:28:03.054 --> 02:28:04.935]  It's called Shut Up and Be Happy.
[02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:06.817]  It's about martial law, if you've never heard it.
[02:28:07.417 --> 02:28:08.778]  Actually, that is in our playlist.
[02:28:08.818 --> 02:28:09.559]  He may have missed it.
[02:28:09.999 --> 02:28:12.601]  We should come in and play the Ice-T martial law.
[02:28:12.621 --> 02:28:14.982]  We also have a version he did with Dave Mustaine, but thank you.
[02:28:15.002 --> 02:28:15.443]  We'll do that.
[02:28:15.463 --> 02:28:16.543]  You were making a point.
[02:28:16.563 --> 02:28:16.743]  Go ahead.
[02:28:16.763 --> 02:28:18.705]  Well, do you have your own Ask the Xanthem product yet?
[02:28:19.878 --> 02:28:20.018]  No.
[02:28:20.138 --> 02:28:20.619]  Astaxanthin?
[02:28:21.679 --> 02:28:22.359]  You need to look into that.
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:22.960]  I've heard of it.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:27.342]  You talk about an antioxidant that is fat-soluble.
[02:28:27.382 --> 02:28:34.326]  If you combine it with fish oil, it goes in your body and it protects your nervous system from oxidative damage.
[02:28:34.366 --> 02:28:38.108]  You need to get that product because it is the perfect complement to everything else that you're doing.
[02:28:38.168 --> 02:28:40.510]  Astaxanthin, it's a microalgae extract.
[02:28:40.570 --> 02:28:42.151]  It's grown in large ponds.
[02:28:42.871 --> 02:28:44.853]  And it's stress-adaptive.
[02:28:45.134 --> 02:28:50.159]  You grow it by stressing the microbes, and they build the astaxanthin to protect themselves from radiation.
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:51.321]  That's what it is.
[02:28:51.681 --> 02:28:51.941]  Wow!
[02:28:52.362 --> 02:28:53.363]  Well, help us launch that.
[02:28:53.383 --> 02:28:55.486]  You can find theirs at healthranger.com.
[02:28:55.766 --> 02:28:56.246]  We'll be back.
[02:28:56.367 --> 02:28:57.348]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:06.223]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:06.783 --> 02:29:14.187]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:29:14.887 --> 02:29:19.590]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:29:20.190 --> 02:29:22.111]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:29:22.731 --> 02:29:26.153]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:29:26.954 --> 02:29:29.435]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:29:30.095 --> 02:29:36.757]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:29:37.357 --> 02:29:44.599]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:29:45.459 --> 02:29:52.101]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:29:52.681 --> 02:29:53.761]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:29:54.121 --> 02:29:55.942]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:56.762 --> 02:29:59.724]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:30:00.264 --> 02:30:02.085]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:02.345 --> 02:30:05.808]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:30:06.108 --> 02:30:12.852]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:30:13.152 --> 02:30:17.895]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:30:17.915 --> 02:30:18.435]  It's very simple.
[02:30:18.635 --> 02:30:19.556]  We went out and looked.
[02:30:19.596 --> 02:30:20.156]  What is the top?
[02:30:20.236 --> 02:30:20.776]  What is the best?
[02:30:21.137 --> 02:30:22.357]  We'll just put even more product in.
[02:30:22.377 --> 02:30:22.998]  We'll make it better.
[02:30:23.078 --> 02:30:25.939]  Leading competitors put $2 of product in it, sell it for $60.
[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:29.362]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:30:29.842 --> 02:30:31.603]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:30:31.743 --> 02:30:34.645]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:30:36.886 --> 02:30:38.927]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:30:39.228 --> 02:30:43.050]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:46.493]  But, I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:30:46.953 --> 02:30:49.855]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:30:50.115 --> 02:30:53.517]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[02:30:53.758 --> 02:30:56.059]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:30:56.359 --> 02:30:57.040]  It's amazing.
[02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:59.902]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:03.996 --> 02:31:08.457]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:31:08.677 --> 02:31:13.359]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:31:13.979 --> 02:31:19.820]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:32.824]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:42.271]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:31:42.291 --> 02:31:44.193]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:31:44.513 --> 02:31:45.634]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:31:45.654 --> 02:31:46.895]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:31:46.915 --> 02:31:48.336]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:31:48.536 --> 02:31:50.016]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:31:50.517 --> 02:31:52.117]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:31:52.137 --> 02:31:53.938]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:31:54.278 --> 02:31:56.879]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:31:56.919 --> 02:31:57.779]  This is insane.
[02:31:58.199 --> 02:31:59.820]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:02.620]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:32:03.061 --> 02:32:04.601]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:32:04.621 --> 02:32:06.462]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:32:06.482 --> 02:32:08.322]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:32:09.203 --> 02:32:15.124]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:32:15.384 --> 02:32:16.705]  All just moderate dose.
[02:32:18.234 --> 02:32:26.221]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:32:26.261 --> 02:32:28.423]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:28.444 --> 02:32:29.825]  But thank you for committing.
[02:32:33.889 --> 02:32:36.712]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:32:37.092 --> 02:32:39.715]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:32:39.735 --> 02:32:44.500]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:51.086]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:32:51.126 --> 02:32:54.229]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:32:54.569 --> 02:32:55.871]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:33:06.139 --> 02:33:10.302]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.553 --> 02:33:29.197]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.883 --> 02:33:43.384]  Hotel Motel.
[02:33:45.906 --> 02:33:47.268]  Going to a show.
[02:33:49.289 --> 02:33:51.191]  There's some great Australian music right here.
[02:33:51.211 --> 02:33:54.073]  Playin' rock and roll.
[02:33:54.133 --> 02:33:54.634]  Crank it up.
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:03.001]  Broken bones.
[02:34:04.282 --> 02:34:04.742]  Ha ha.
[02:34:05.883 --> 02:34:06.464]  Gettin' took.
[02:34:07.445 --> 02:34:08.205]  I'm here to tell ya.
[02:34:10.549 --> 02:34:11.730]  It's harder than it looks.
[02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:15.271]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:15.311 --> 02:34:17.492]  Ladies and gentlemen, the health ranger Mike Adams is here with us.
[02:34:17.512 --> 02:34:30.459]  I was telling him some inside baseball during the break, and he had some of his own stories, but... When you look at Pelosi, or you look at Hillary, or you look at Michael Moore, you look at the Queen of England, you look at the globalists, you look at the Rockefellers, they look so unhappy, so evil, so twisted.
[02:34:30.939 --> 02:34:37.262]  They're the losers that are willing to give up their humanity to do things other people won't do for total control.
[02:34:38.527 --> 02:34:39.908]  But they're not the real problem.
[02:34:40.608 --> 02:34:47.491]  As Lord Acton said, and as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson all similarly said, that evil only triumphs because good men and women do nothing.
[02:34:48.472 --> 02:34:51.953]  And they can't really even say who did the quote because there's different variants of it.
[02:34:52.313 --> 02:34:53.034]  But it's really true.
[02:34:53.414 --> 02:34:57.796]  Who we have to blame is that we let Nancy Pelosi and George Soros rule over us.
[02:34:58.683 --> 02:34:59.564]  We let them do this?
[02:35:00.104 --> 02:35:00.664]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:35:00.924 --> 02:35:02.405]  You only lose if you surrender.
[02:35:02.785 --> 02:35:08.589]  If they break your will, you have to concede to be overtaken.
[02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:16.133]  Like, just on this gun issue, Second Amendment, if you're willing to stand up and defend your right to defend yourself, they can't take the guns.
[02:35:16.194 --> 02:35:17.454]  They physically can't get it done.
[02:35:17.494 --> 02:35:18.115]  It can't happen.
[02:35:18.795 --> 02:35:31.760]  They can only take the guns if you surrender, if they break your will and you say, oh, we're so horrible, all of us gun owners, we don't deserve to have guns, we should all just be subjected to criminals who want to murder, rape, and kill us all.
[02:35:32.561 --> 02:35:33.021]  Then you lose.
[02:35:33.795 --> 02:35:35.397]  If you stand, you win.
[02:35:35.958 --> 02:35:40.382]  And getting back to the spiritual war that we talked about earlier, if you think about it, why do we have free will?
[02:35:40.703 --> 02:35:44.887]  Why are we born as divine beings with free will and consciousness and self-awareness?
[02:35:45.588 --> 02:35:50.454]  If God wanted us all to be drones and minions and slaves, we would never have been born with free will.
[02:35:51.314 --> 02:35:54.939]  And atheists always say, well, God's just saying it's looking all the bad in the world.
[02:35:54.999 --> 02:35:58.824]  No, God loves us so much that he gave us free will so we can choose where we want to be.
[02:35:58.904 --> 02:36:03.691]  And so many, again, of these so-called atheists and these globalists are all into the occult behind the scenes.
[02:36:04.111 --> 02:36:05.733]  They believe they have will.
[02:36:06.314 --> 02:36:09.018]  And they're trying to say we don't have will and we're slaves.
[02:36:09.078 --> 02:36:18.051]  They believe you're not conscious unless you have will, but then they're actively from birth trying to make sure you never activate your will so that you never discover you have a spirit.
[02:36:18.071 --> 02:36:22.377]  Because they can break a will, but they can't break the spirit if you are ever able to make that choice.
[02:36:23.098 --> 02:36:27.580]  Right, and they know that to defeat you, you have to choose surrender.
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:30.181]  And they try to force you into that corner.
[02:36:30.201 --> 02:36:30.601]  It's Faust.
[02:36:30.621 --> 02:36:31.361]  He is Faust.
[02:36:31.501 --> 02:36:31.741]  It is.
[02:36:31.761 --> 02:36:32.362]  The archetype.
[02:36:32.782 --> 02:36:36.003]  He never thought he could get out of it.
[02:36:36.043 --> 02:36:37.503]  He never knew that he had free will.
[02:36:37.884 --> 02:36:38.564]  He got tricked.
[02:36:38.604 --> 02:36:39.804]  He could have gotten out right to the end.
[02:36:39.984 --> 02:36:40.685]  And you know what?
[02:36:40.745 --> 02:36:43.786]  The ultimate answer is souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:44.506 --> 02:36:45.867]  What we have, our spirit, our souls.
[02:36:45.928 --> 02:36:46.908]  I'm going to tweet that.
[02:36:46.968 --> 02:36:48.490]  Mike Adams, souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:49.311]  Souls are bulletproof.
[02:36:49.331 --> 02:36:51.573]  What was the other thing you said earlier?
[02:36:51.593 --> 02:36:52.433]  You said, I'm really pushy.
[02:36:52.513 --> 02:36:53.995]  It was very profound.
[02:36:54.015 --> 02:36:56.457]  I'll never negotiate with evil or stop negotiating with evil.
[02:36:56.817 --> 02:36:58.999]  The thing is, they can try to destroy your business.
[02:36:59.039 --> 02:37:00.661]  They can destroy your physical body.
[02:37:01.321 --> 02:37:08.483]  They can destroy it because your flesh is subject to bullets or other forms of abuse that they would try to dish out.
[02:37:08.863 --> 02:37:10.404]  But your soul is bulletproof.
[02:37:10.664 --> 02:37:14.665]  They can never capture your soul unless you give it over willfully.
[02:37:14.965 --> 02:37:16.846]  And that is where you can draw the line.
[02:37:16.886 --> 02:37:19.366]  You can say, my life is lived with purpose.
[02:37:19.447 --> 02:37:20.807]  And that is incredibly profound.
[02:37:20.827 --> 02:37:22.327]  I want this to be my quote.
[02:37:22.347 --> 02:37:24.048]  I've said it before, but I want this tweeted with your tweets.
[02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:27.212]  You cannot sell your soul.
[02:37:27.332 --> 02:37:33.497]  You can be conned into believing you sold it, but if you truly repent of bad things you've done, you will be cleansed.
[02:37:33.537 --> 02:37:34.298]  It's metaphysical.
[02:37:34.558 --> 02:37:39.742]  But you get tricked into going, well, you're already screwed, so you might as well join it and take as many with you as you can.
[02:37:40.143 --> 02:37:41.884]  That's the big trick of the spirit.
[02:37:42.085 --> 02:37:47.149]  Whether you believe in God or the devil or not, the globalists do, and they believe they're damned.
[02:37:47.209 --> 02:37:48.230]  They believe it's too far.
[02:37:48.250 --> 02:37:49.331]  I want to tell George Soros,
[02:37:49.651 --> 02:37:51.132]  He's probably already committed the ultimate sin.
[02:37:51.152 --> 02:37:52.373]  He knows the Holy Spirit's real.
[02:37:52.673 --> 02:37:54.214]  He knows he could have gotten out of this.
[02:37:54.534 --> 02:37:58.576]  And that's the ultimate sin is saying that you don't want to be reprieved.
[02:37:59.356 --> 02:38:01.437]  And that you choose evil just because you're a piece of crap.
[02:38:01.698 --> 02:38:02.898]  But I choose life.
[02:38:03.439 --> 02:38:05.600]  And think about why did the Pope say there is no hell?
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:06.821]  Reportedly.
[02:38:07.441 --> 02:38:22.437]  Because if there are no repercussions to your actions, and these atheists who are globalists, they believe there's no soul, there's no spirit, there are no repercussions after this life, it gives them the moral justification to carry out heinous crimes against humanity, heinous narcissism,
[02:38:23.038 --> 02:38:24.339]  Well, that's the whole ecumenical movement!
[02:38:50.789 --> 02:38:55.273]  Is that, oh, this is all figurative, but let's expand on that.
[02:38:55.854 --> 02:38:58.597]  This Pope is a globalist, 100%.
[02:38:58.797 --> 02:39:06.064]  We're going to go back to the phone calls right now, but the point you make about how they don't want any repercussions, they don't want it in this lifetime.
[02:39:06.484 --> 02:39:10.248]  And I've noticed the way the universe works is everything is repeated.
[02:39:11.451 --> 02:39:16.054]  And as you go up, the universe isn't in entropy falling apart, it's becoming more advanced.
[02:39:16.474 --> 02:39:17.475]  That's the truth.
[02:39:17.495 --> 02:39:18.716]  Things are becoming stronger.
[02:39:19.036 --> 02:39:25.120]  Yes, some things are rotting and falling away, but overall the universe is getting bigger, more complex, and they know this.
[02:39:26.981 --> 02:39:35.306]  And again, they are just trying to keep us from transcending their entire system because they're fallen and they choose to basically be at this lower level.
[02:39:35.987 --> 02:39:42.133]  And the most important thing that we can do is live a life with purpose in defeating evil.
[02:39:42.653 --> 02:39:51.801]  Even if they one day manage to destroy your business, to silence your voice, even to destroy your body and murder you, your soul is bulletproof.
[02:39:51.942 --> 02:39:54.444]  And they can't take your soul unless you give it willfully.
[02:39:56.572 --> 02:39:57.292]  Is that your quote?
[02:39:57.652 --> 02:39:59.053]  I don't know.
[02:39:59.393 --> 02:40:00.193]  I'm not quoting anybody else.
[02:40:00.213 --> 02:40:00.933]  No, it's powerful.
[02:40:00.953 --> 02:40:01.593]  No, it's beautiful.
[02:40:02.173 --> 02:40:11.135]  We know that ideas are bulletproof, to quote V for Vendetta, which is a Victor Hugo change on what he said, that no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:40:11.476 --> 02:40:11.876]  But you're right.
[02:40:11.956 --> 02:40:13.316]  The soul is bulletproof.
[02:40:13.756 --> 02:40:15.036]  The truth is bulletproof.
[02:40:16.037 --> 02:40:16.937]  And the war is spiritual.
[02:40:17.759 --> 02:40:18.699]  The war is not physical.
[02:40:19.419 --> 02:40:24.881]  Your life and my life are inconsequential in the greater battle of good versus evil that's taking place.
[02:40:25.181 --> 02:40:39.044]  Here we are in a small window of time, expressing our love for God and the divine, our love for life, our love for truth and transparency, and being viciously attacked by actual literal demonic forces.
[02:40:39.185 --> 02:40:41.265]  And endless lies and things we never said.
[02:40:41.785 --> 02:40:42.125]  Of course.
[02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:42.445]  Why?
[02:40:42.485 --> 02:40:44.386]  Because they know we know who they are.
[02:40:45.066 --> 02:40:50.032]  And the only way they get away with those lies is they isolate people from the truth about what we are actually saying.
[02:40:50.672 --> 02:40:55.398]  They have to separate, and they have to destroy, and they have to suppress.
[02:40:55.718 --> 02:40:57.880]  These are all tactics of evil.
[02:40:58.461 --> 02:40:58.721]  Right?
[02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:01.644]  Just by their very tactics, you know they are evil.
[02:41:01.745 --> 02:41:02.385]  They are.
[02:41:02.445 --> 02:41:02.906]  Exactly.
[02:41:03.006 --> 02:41:04.788]  It's their signature, their attack profile.
[02:41:04.848 --> 02:41:05.689]  You've seen it before.
[02:41:05.749 --> 02:41:06.210]  You know them.
[02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.430]  Yes.
[02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.011]  And that's the weird thing is they're an army.
[02:41:08.071 --> 02:41:08.971]  It's not just a culture.
[02:41:09.231 --> 02:41:09.932]  It's a spirit.
[02:41:10.032 --> 02:41:10.612]  It's a look.
[02:41:10.752 --> 02:41:13.434]  It's real, folks.
[02:41:13.634 --> 02:41:17.015]  And they can't get past the style of presentation.
[02:41:17.276 --> 02:41:19.377]  You know, your style is very aggressive.
[02:41:19.417 --> 02:41:20.117]  It's very assertive.
[02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:21.518]  And in some ways, mine is too.
[02:41:21.538 --> 02:41:22.498]  But you're known for that.
[02:41:22.878 --> 02:41:26.800]  But the substance of what you're teaching is actually love and light.
[02:41:26.961 --> 02:41:27.281]  Exactly.
[02:41:27.321 --> 02:41:30.342]  But they do it all in a NPR fake voice, but it's pure death.
[02:41:30.662 --> 02:41:31.123]  Exactly.
[02:41:31.163 --> 02:41:31.503]  That's it.
[02:41:31.863 --> 02:41:34.846]  On the surface, they look all lovey-dovey and cuddly and cute.
[02:41:35.306 --> 02:41:39.730]  But underneath, they are demonic and they love to murder unborn babies.
[02:41:40.151 --> 02:41:41.152]  They love to destroy people.
[02:41:41.172 --> 02:41:41.412]  That's an H.R.
[02:41:41.432 --> 02:41:42.753]  Tolkien quote.
[02:41:42.773 --> 02:41:45.896]  I look and act foul sometimes, but I feel fair.
[02:41:46.216 --> 02:41:47.698]  They look fair, but feel foul.
[02:41:47.938 --> 02:41:59.842]  Right, and it takes an advanced neurology to be able to judge people by the substance of what they're saying, the content of their speech, rather than their outer appearance or their skin color.
[02:41:59.862 --> 02:42:00.863]  You know, think about this.
[02:42:01.143 --> 02:42:02.343]  What is diversity on the left?
[02:42:02.643 --> 02:42:08.805]  It's a room full of people with different skin color who are absolute 100% obedient to the same exact ideas.
[02:42:09.065 --> 02:42:09.966]  They call that diversity.
[02:42:10.526 --> 02:42:11.286]  That's conformity.
[02:42:11.707 --> 02:42:12.467]  That's obedience.
[02:42:12.527 --> 02:42:13.627]  That's not diversity at all.
[02:42:13.907 --> 02:42:19.630]  Diversity is a room full of people who have different ideas, and different voices, and different backgrounds, regardless of their skill level.
[02:42:19.650 --> 02:42:23.351]  Who was the black CEO, the diversity head, the black lady, beautiful, smart?
[02:42:23.691 --> 02:42:25.652]  She said, you can have a room full of European men.
[02:42:25.672 --> 02:42:27.013]  They'll have diverse ideas.
[02:42:27.033 --> 02:42:27.773]  That's diversity.
[02:42:28.714 --> 02:42:29.494]  They removed her.
[02:42:29.514 --> 02:42:30.154]  Yeah, they attacked her.
[02:42:30.554 --> 02:42:31.395]  Who was she the head of?
[02:42:31.415 --> 02:42:32.395]  I don't remember her name.
[02:42:32.655 --> 02:42:33.696]  But that's the point.
[02:42:34.176 --> 02:42:35.296]  She's got it.
[02:42:35.316 --> 02:42:36.677]  She's been around for one word, so yeah.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:40.982]  Diverse ideas, diverse voices, exactly what YouTube is trying to stamp out.
[02:42:41.903 --> 02:42:47.967]  But that's where Real Truth comes from, is a diverse collection of ideas and voices.
[02:42:48.087 --> 02:42:50.549]  I promise, Jennifer, you disagree, you're at the head of the line.
[02:42:50.849 --> 02:42:56.013]  And Jeff, Carlos, Kent, Mike, James, we're going to continue with Mike Adams, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:56.053 --> 02:42:58.054]  They're trying to block those URLs.
[02:42:58.114 --> 02:42:59.915]  It's critical to punch those out.
[02:43:06.121 --> 02:43:07.501]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:07.561 --> 02:43:09.002]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:43:09.062 --> 02:43:09.422]  Go ahead.
[02:43:09.522 --> 02:43:09.822]  Yes.
[02:43:10.242 --> 02:43:10.942]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:11.062 --> 02:43:17.263]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:17.483 --> 02:43:21.464]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:21.704 --> 02:43:23.144]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:23.504 --> 02:43:30.205]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:43:30.285 --> 02:43:33.146]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:33.386 --> 02:43:38.729]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:38.769 --> 02:43:46.593]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:43:46.613 --> 02:43:52.436]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coalital Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:52.576 --> 02:43:57.898]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality coalital silver.
[02:43:57.998 --> 02:44:00.980]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:44:07.668 --> 02:44:16.190]  I was talking to Steven Seagal last night and this morning and he had some very heartfelt, very, I think, compelling things to say that just at a gut level rang true to me.
[02:44:16.671 --> 02:44:18.731]  Plus what we've seen what's been done to the president, now admitted.
[02:44:18.811 --> 02:44:23.333]  Some women offered up two million big Democratic Party donors to say that Trump raped them.
[02:44:23.713 --> 02:44:24.913]  The women have recorded this.
[02:44:25.053 --> 02:44:26.213]  I know the FBI has it.
[02:44:26.553 --> 02:44:27.674]  We first broke that months ago.
[02:44:27.714 --> 02:44:28.694]  That's now been in the news.
[02:44:29.194 --> 02:44:31.655]  So we know there's a bunch of foul play going on.
[02:44:31.675 --> 02:44:34.516]  I don't know personally about this latest thing or what happened.
[02:44:35.456 --> 02:44:36.237]  The thing that I find interesting
[02:44:50.435 --> 02:44:53.078]  This woman is saying she was in my movie.
[02:44:53.479 --> 02:44:55.461]  There's no record of her being in my movie.
[02:44:55.702 --> 02:44:56.643]  She doesn't have a credit.
[02:44:56.883 --> 02:44:57.824]  We've looked through the movie.
[02:44:57.864 --> 02:44:58.966]  She's not in the movie.
[02:44:59.346 --> 02:45:01.990]  She says she came to my home in Beverly Hills.
[02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:02.490]  Guess what?
[02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:04.773]  I didn't have a home in Beverly Hills.
[02:45:04.873 --> 02:45:06.676]  I think these are all made-up stories.
[02:45:07.557 --> 02:45:19.689]  And, uh, you know, I not only resent it, but this is something that is designed to destroy my life, destroy my income, destroy my marriage, destroy my children and my children's lives.
[02:45:19.949 --> 02:45:21.791]  And it is evil what they're doing.
[02:45:21.931 --> 02:45:24.734]  We have 90 to 95% fake journalism, fake news.
[02:45:26.976 --> 02:45:31.659]  90 to 95% of the news in America now is fake news.
[02:45:31.679 --> 02:45:33.060]  Nobody has been fake news before.
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:35.181]  Nobody knows what's true and what's not.
[02:45:35.761 --> 02:45:44.306]  And when you're in a situation like that where you don't know what's true and what's not, how can you weather the storm?
[02:45:44.346 --> 02:45:45.607]  How can you walk forward?
[02:45:46.107 --> 02:45:47.328]  How can you do anything?
[02:45:48.930 --> 02:45:50.992]  And know that you're right about what you're doing.
[02:45:51.312 --> 02:45:53.295]  How can you make a conclusion and know that you're right?
[02:45:53.315 --> 02:45:57.280]  You know, like I say, there's a deeper, deeper, darker picture here going on.
[02:45:58.041 --> 02:46:02.966]  And what's really happening, in my opinion, is not just the witch hunt and the McCarthyism.
[02:46:03.567 --> 02:46:14.757]  But it's also, I believe, and I shouldn't be the one to say this, but I will, and I'm sure you'll confirm it, I'm also being persecuted for my political views and my political affiliation.
[02:46:14.797 --> 02:46:18.680]  There is a secret society within our government.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:21.082]  This is a full coup d'etat right now.
[02:46:21.442 --> 02:46:22.443]  It's just secret.
[02:46:22.963 --> 02:46:31.731]  And Congress is interviewing informants right now that are talking about this, and they are completely confirming that the sole purpose of this
[02:46:32.411 --> 02:46:43.160]  Our secret society is to overthrow Trump and destroy anyone who is friends with Trump or supporting Trump and particularly supporting Putin.
[02:46:43.681 --> 02:46:51.967]  And once they do this, their agenda is to be able to overthrow the America that is there now and start a war with Russia.
[02:46:52.308 --> 02:46:57.172]  That's what we all are starting to see.
[02:47:05.558 --> 02:47:08.143]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.213 --> 02:47:28.115]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:28.595 --> 02:47:30.956]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.937 --> 02:47:34.518]  Mike Adams has been saying a lot of really profound things.
[02:47:34.558 --> 02:47:36.079]  I mean, he is on fire.
[02:47:37.019 --> 02:47:46.444]  And you said something during the break when we were talking about the mystery of evil that really explained at a spiritual level and then as above so below at a governmental cultural level.
[02:47:48.171 --> 02:47:59.599]  One way to look at this is that once people have sold out to evil and they've decided to serve a destructive, demonic force, they have to, you could say, earn points, in essence, in what I call the hierarchy of evil.
[02:48:00.139 --> 02:48:05.743]  And in the same way that communist China today is tracking these social conformity points of their own citizens.
[02:48:06.123 --> 02:48:13.848]  And if you don't score high enough through obedience to government, then you're denied loans and college entrance and even denied access to public transportation.
[02:48:13.868 --> 02:48:15.550]  This is the China scoring system.
[02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.951]  Well, believe it or not,
[02:48:18.131 --> 02:48:20.813]  Actually, Satan has a similar kind of scoring system.
[02:48:21.333 --> 02:48:28.117]  Once you've surrendered to evil, you have to rack up points in that hierarchy of evil by destroying good people.
[02:48:28.637 --> 02:48:38.103]  And this is done through censorship, this is done through slander, defamation, lying about people, trying to distort things, trying to... Mothers teaching their children how to commit suicide?
[02:48:38.263 --> 02:48:39.663]  Well, absolutely, yeah.
[02:48:39.864 --> 02:48:45.267]  And murdering living babies, partial birth abortions, and harvesting their organs for...
[02:48:46.007 --> 02:48:48.188]  Biggest point is a mother killing her baby knowingly.
[02:48:48.448 --> 02:48:52.849]  Not if you did it not knowing, or lied to, but knowingly putting your kid on Prozac Ritalin.
[02:48:53.209 --> 02:48:55.770]  It's like a cult with women, particularly to mess up their sons.
[02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:58.510]  The thing is, in their minds, they're scoring big.
[02:48:58.850 --> 02:49:00.731]  That's a big bonus point item.
[02:49:00.751 --> 02:49:10.594]  When they can murder a baby and take those snips and sever the base of the spine as that head comes out of the birth canal, and they can snip that child, and in their minds, they're seething with evil.
[02:49:10.634 --> 02:49:11.674]  Big points, big points.
[02:49:11.994 --> 02:49:14.655]  They just scored huge to their master, you see?
[02:49:17.006 --> 02:49:36.879]  By the way, I've interviewed a top psychiatrist that famously, I forget her name, I heard her like on ABC News, I got her on, I forget her name, she's the famous lady that knows all the serial killers and goes and interviews them and she described it like they're in horrible depression, they're tortured demonically, they all think Satan's after them, but when they kill a little kid or something, for like a day or two it's like white light and the devil says they've done well.
[02:49:37.139 --> 02:49:42.723]  And she said that yes, they're all really Satanist, but it's funny, she writes that and says that, but the news never picks it up.
[02:49:43.826 --> 02:49:52.650]  The greatest, the big battle is forces that protect life, which goes along with liberty and divinity and children and so on.
[02:49:52.850 --> 02:49:54.290]  Clean water, clean food, all of it.
[02:49:54.430 --> 02:49:54.650]  Right.
[02:49:54.750 --> 02:49:56.631]  And even the right to self-defense is a divine right.
[02:49:56.691 --> 02:49:59.992]  It's reflected throughout nature, throughout plants and animals, all over Mother Nature.
[02:50:00.012 --> 02:50:08.016]  The Second Amendment is simply a reflection of nature, by the way, versus the dark demonic force of destroying life.
[02:50:08.036 --> 02:50:08.316]  That's right.
[02:50:08.376 --> 02:50:09.796]  Cactuses have spines.
[02:50:09.976 --> 02:50:10.737]  Well, that's hateful.
[02:50:10.757 --> 02:50:11.177]  Take them away.
[02:50:11.357 --> 02:50:17.341]  Well, dandelions actually emit a molecule that defends them from neighboring weeds, for example.
[02:50:17.661 --> 02:50:19.182]  This is true throughout all of nature.
[02:50:19.282 --> 02:50:22.884]  Trees, berry bushes... If you don't have a defense, you die.
[02:50:23.325 --> 02:50:25.026]  Well, that's exactly the case.
[02:50:25.606 --> 02:50:26.627]  Defense is life.
[02:50:26.767 --> 02:50:27.728]  Lack of defense is death.
[02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:31.952]  And my point is that the Second Amendment is a reflection of a divine principle.
[02:50:32.252 --> 02:50:32.512]  You see?
[02:50:32.812 --> 02:50:38.695]  So those who oppose the Second Amendment oppose human rights and oppose God in truth.
[02:50:39.056 --> 02:50:44.839]  Because God wants you to have the right to defend your body, your family, your community, your country.
[02:50:44.859 --> 02:50:45.659]  You're a different guy.
[02:50:45.699 --> 02:50:48.861]  You were already smart and great five years ago, but you took this hiatus.
[02:50:48.881 --> 02:50:50.121]  What happened to you during the hiatus?
[02:50:50.141 --> 02:50:51.402]  So you're like off in the wilderness?
[02:50:51.642 --> 02:50:53.083]  Well, you're out there on your goat farm, but...
[02:50:53.403 --> 02:50:57.885]  I do have goats and I do walk in nature every day and I get a lot of inspiration from nature.
[02:50:58.445 --> 02:51:13.511]  I do not attend a church, but I am very spiritual and a lot of what I'm talking about here today are things that have become apparent, that have been given to me, I suppose, or have become obvious, have emerged, let's say, from experience and introspection.
[02:51:14.031 --> 02:51:17.452]  But, I mean, this rings true with your experience as well, right?
[02:51:17.913 --> 02:51:18.233]  Oh, I mean...
[02:51:19.053 --> 02:51:21.134]  Everybody around me is like, man, what is going on?
[02:51:21.154 --> 02:51:22.194]  They see it.
[02:51:22.894 --> 02:51:23.854]  It's like real.
[02:51:24.034 --> 02:51:27.375]  It's like we're given incredible power, but we are under attack.
[02:51:27.495 --> 02:51:30.256]  And it's like people are like, then they realize they're either in it or they're not.
[02:51:30.936 --> 02:51:33.917]  Well, I used to have a lot more faith in humanity than I do today.
[02:51:34.277 --> 02:51:43.459]  Now I have faith in certain individuals who are, who have decided to dedicate their lives to liberty and light and truth and working for the good and working to protect life.
[02:51:44.179 --> 02:51:51.341]  And at the same time I see the masses of humanity becoming so deceived and distorted and twisted and demonic.
[02:51:51.621 --> 02:51:54.362]  Like if you could put on glasses like in that... They live.
[02:51:54.762 --> 02:51:55.362]  Yeah, they live.
[02:51:55.622 --> 02:51:56.383]  And you could see them.
[02:51:56.423 --> 02:51:58.103]  They'd be like little demonic gremlins.
[02:51:58.483 --> 02:52:02.384]  And they are so numerous and so lost.
[02:52:02.845 --> 02:52:04.645]  You know, you want to help those people.
[02:52:04.985 --> 02:52:05.805]  And we do help some.
[02:52:05.966 --> 02:52:07.786]  Sometimes someone can transform.
[02:52:08.166 --> 02:52:09.507]  But not most of the time.
[02:52:09.567 --> 02:52:10.527]  That's right, that's right.
[02:52:11.047 --> 02:52:16.288]  The world is... And they use you trying to save them as a weakness so they can get you and rip you down.
[02:52:16.348 --> 02:52:16.728]  That's true.
[02:52:17.148 --> 02:52:28.670]  Sometimes you have to wait for the right time for someone to have that spiritual maturity before they are ready to be, you could say, awakened or saved or whatever term you want to use.
[02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:37.672]  I mean, even Jesus Christ, he could not, you know, with his power and with his charisma, even he could not go around and magically transform everybody, right?
[02:52:38.112 --> 02:52:38.892]  They had to decide.
[02:52:40.003 --> 02:52:45.988]  And so, I, you know... That's the one God, by giving us free will, limited his power.
[02:52:46.688 --> 02:52:48.229]  Think about all... He's not a dictator!
[02:52:48.470 --> 02:52:49.370]  Yeah.
[02:52:49.571 --> 02:52:50.671]  Right, exactly.
[02:52:51.112 --> 02:52:52.493]  You have to decide your course.
[02:52:52.853 --> 02:52:56.736]  You either choose evil or choose good, and never has that choice been more apparent.
[02:52:56.816 --> 02:52:59.779]  And it's that choice that is the real value of everything.
[02:53:00.219 --> 02:53:01.800]  That is the essence of consciousness.
[02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:03.521]  It is the essence of our future.
[02:53:03.602 --> 02:53:04.162]  It is everything.
[02:53:04.402 --> 02:53:05.743]  Let's go to Jennifer in New Jersey.
[02:53:05.783 --> 02:53:07.084]  She disagrees on China.
[02:53:07.124 --> 02:53:07.465]  Go ahead.
[02:53:07.725 --> 02:53:08.385]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[02:53:08.405 --> 02:53:09.086]  We appreciate you holding.
[02:53:10.049 --> 02:53:11.590]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:13.812]  I listen to your show very often.
[02:53:14.313 --> 02:53:20.478]  I realize that it seems like you don't know much about China and I heard you want to visit Russia.
[02:53:20.958 --> 02:53:31.026]  So my suggestion is why don't you visit China at the same time, spend time and see different cities and then see how people live.
[02:53:31.066 --> 02:53:33.989]  Then I think you will come back probably with a more
[02:53:35.097 --> 02:53:46.265]  You know, real real about China because what you talk about China seems like you take right from the propaganda and then without any knowing about it.
[02:53:46.606 --> 02:53:55.132]  Well I know Paul Watson was married to a nice Chinese lady for six years and he went there a bunch and he said it was pretty pretty bad but look I know there's two different systems in China.
[02:53:55.612 --> 02:53:58.314]  There's the elite and the small middle class and the rest of the people.
[02:53:58.654 --> 02:53:59.955]  I'm not against Chinese folks.
[02:54:00.436 --> 02:54:03.138]  My sister's Korean adopted and I love everybody.
[02:54:04.118 --> 02:54:08.860]  I just know the globalists use China and their hard-working people to leverage America out of business.
[02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:12.821]  And so, what do you think of Trump and his statements about making trade fair?
[02:54:12.941 --> 02:54:15.002]  Or do you not think there's any trade differences?
[02:54:17.402 --> 02:54:26.305]  If you go to visit China, China people 55, they're all on the social security, China kind of, okay?
[02:54:26.665 --> 02:54:29.066]  So they have nine times increase.
[02:54:29.847 --> 02:54:30.668]  We're good to go.
[02:54:51.681 --> 02:54:52.822]  Jennifer, I want to hear from you.
[02:54:52.882 --> 02:54:54.982]  Mike Adams is married to a great lady from Taiwan.
[02:54:55.002 --> 02:54:55.963]  I've met her many times.
[02:54:56.003 --> 02:54:56.403]  Great lady.
[02:54:56.503 --> 02:54:56.783]  Author.
[02:54:57.103 --> 02:54:59.264]  Runs a bunch of big companies.
[02:54:59.284 --> 02:55:01.165]  You're her right hand.
[02:55:01.565 --> 02:55:02.465]  What is her view of China?
[02:55:02.485 --> 02:55:04.206]  Well, first of all, let me say Jennifer.
[02:55:07.427 --> 02:55:15.635]  You represent a lot of people there who are struggling, I think, under a system of incredible tyranny and control.
[02:55:15.715 --> 02:55:22.502]  There is no country that has a stronger system of oppression of its citizens, other than perhaps North Korea.
[02:55:22.982 --> 02:55:27.347]  But it's not a comment on you as a person, but the system under which
[02:55:27.927 --> 02:55:29.228]  You and your people are suffering.
[02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.969]  I've been to China.
[02:55:30.169 --> 02:55:30.850]  Well, my view is this.
[02:55:30.890 --> 02:55:33.453]  If you conform and you're smart, okay, you might do okay.
[02:55:33.473 --> 02:55:35.535]  If you're a farmer, they'll take your property, you're dead.
[02:55:35.835 --> 02:55:37.918]  And if you resist, they'll kill your ass in two seconds.
[02:55:38.538 --> 02:55:38.979]  That's right.
[02:55:39.079 --> 02:55:39.439]  That's right.
[02:55:39.679 --> 02:55:49.350]  And there is a social be against scoring system in China today that is a model for what people... So ask her in Chinese, and then she can say it in English, what she thinks of the social score.
[02:55:50.490 --> 02:55:56.832]  Well, Jennifer, I want to tell you, thank you for your call.
[02:55:56.892 --> 02:55:59.613]  But you are not a bad person.
[02:55:59.934 --> 02:56:05.936]  We want you to know, basically I'm trying to say, we are all about humanity.
[02:56:06.416 --> 02:56:11.578]  And I don't want to keep talking in Chinese here, but you can be a good person still living under a system of tyranny.
[02:56:11.598 --> 02:56:12.178]  Does that make sense?
[02:56:13.758 --> 02:56:13.978]  What?
[02:56:15.939 --> 02:56:16.679]  Does that make sense?
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:18.300]  Make what sense?
[02:56:19.369 --> 02:56:20.510]  That you may be a good person.
[02:56:20.530 --> 02:56:22.211]  We're not judging the Chinese people.
[02:56:22.251 --> 02:56:22.492]  Right.
[02:56:23.052 --> 02:56:23.512]  Exactly.
[02:56:23.572 --> 02:56:23.933]  Thank you.
[02:56:23.953 --> 02:56:27.756]  I am a good person.
[02:56:27.796 --> 02:56:27.976]  Yes.
[02:56:28.176 --> 02:56:29.417]  That's what we're affirming.
[02:56:29.457 --> 02:56:33.560]  But if you're in China, you're living under a system that does not respect your human dignity.
[02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.522]  That freak you out that Mike can speak Chinese?
[02:56:36.683 --> 02:56:37.644]  Mike can do a lot of stuff.
[02:56:37.884 --> 02:56:39.005]  Like Wonder Kid over here.
[02:56:39.765 --> 02:56:42.648]  It's like Transformers more than meets the eye.
[02:56:43.664 --> 02:56:46.907]  Alex, I think you really should visit China.
[02:56:47.227 --> 02:56:47.508]  Okay?
[02:56:48.448 --> 02:56:48.789]  I get it.
[02:56:48.829 --> 02:56:49.569]  Hey, we love you.
[02:56:49.609 --> 02:56:49.970]  Thank you.
[02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.510]  We're out of time.
[02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:51.711]  You should visit China, Alex.
[02:56:51.731 --> 02:56:53.573]  There's a few more segments that you gotta go.
[02:56:53.593 --> 02:56:54.013]  We gotta meet.
[02:56:54.053 --> 02:56:55.715]  We have the next... We're gonna go to the rest of the call.
[02:56:55.735 --> 02:56:56.936]  We're gonna go on a break.
[02:56:57.336 --> 02:56:57.657]  Briefly!
[02:56:58.689 --> 02:57:00.030]  I don't do this as a marketing ploy.
[02:57:00.190 --> 02:57:06.253]  We're about to sell out of our top-selling nootropic brain force, and we're not going to sell out of it for at least a month.
[02:57:06.293 --> 02:57:11.536]  We've got plenty of the real red pill, but we're putting them together because they both go together like a horse and carriage.
[02:57:12.497 --> 02:57:16.459]  They're 50% off individually, 50% off together, but free shipping when you get them together.
[02:57:16.759 --> 02:57:19.021]  That combo has got to end, but I haven't got the new specials.
[02:57:20.101 --> 02:57:24.004]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, we did just end the special on
[02:57:25.225 --> 02:57:30.148]  Michael ZX, that's amazing, the Dr. Group developer, knocks out the mold, yeast, and candida in the gut.
[02:57:30.208 --> 02:57:32.029]  That is no longer 50% off because it's about to sell out.
[02:57:33.109 --> 02:57:37.311]  We've got the new Super Blue Immune Gargle mouthwash in three different sizes.
[02:57:37.331 --> 02:57:39.112]  50% off when you get all three together.
[02:57:39.132 --> 02:57:40.933]  30% off when you get them individually.
[02:57:40.993 --> 02:57:41.854]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:57:41.874 --> 02:57:43.735]  And it's your purchases that make it all possible.
[02:57:43.795 --> 02:57:48.037]  But the 50% off on BrainForce will end today.
[02:57:54.011 --> 02:58:12.320]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:12.401 --> 02:58:17.823]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:58:18.684 --> 02:58:19.664]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:20.044 --> 02:58:22.646]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:58:23.286 --> 02:58:24.267]  And so much more.
[02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:25.968]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:26.188 --> 02:58:27.909]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:27.989 --> 02:58:33.612]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:33.712 --> 02:58:34.913]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:34.933 --> 02:58:36.874]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:36.954 --> 02:58:39.335]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:39.555 --> 02:58:40.796]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:40.976 --> 02:58:42.797]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:58:43.357 --> 02:58:43.938]  Immune Wall.
[02:58:44.058 --> 02:58:45.359]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:45.499 --> 02:58:46.339]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:52.054 --> 02:58:55.256]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:55.697 --> 02:58:57.018]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:57.498 --> 02:59:09.026]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:09.727 --> 02:59:18.593]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:19.053 --> 02:59:24.876]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:25.096 --> 02:59:29.758]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:30.258 --> 02:59:32.579]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:34.260]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:34.660 --> 02:59:44.285]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:44.365 --> 02:59:46.486]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[02:59:47.046 --> 02:59:51.953]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:55.238 --> 03:00:01.126]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.036 --> 03:00:09.976]  Well, he is in fuego!
[03:00:37.748 --> 03:00:39.210]  Mike Adams is in Fuego.
[03:00:39.991 --> 03:00:54.068]  You were already a great engineer and a guy with dozens of sites and best-selling books and the leading health site in the country, but now in your hiatus, you know, I guess out in the Texas Hill Country with your farm and launching all these operations, it's like John the Baptist has come out of the desert.
[03:00:54.148 --> 03:00:55.810]  Look out, Mike Adams is here.
[03:00:55.890 --> 03:00:56.231]  I love it.
[03:00:56.991 --> 03:00:58.212]  Well, it's great to be here, Alex.
[03:00:58.272 --> 03:01:08.555]  I really enjoyed our philosophical discussion today because that's ultimately what it comes down to, but I do want your listeners to know, you know, I don't wear a suit and a shirt like this day-to-day.
[03:01:08.575 --> 03:01:09.276]  I'm on the farm.
[03:01:09.716 --> 03:01:13.737]  You know, I've got actually dirt on the knees of my ranch pants right here right now.
[03:01:13.757 --> 03:01:16.818]  You know, I'm carrying buckets of rain.
[03:01:16.838 --> 03:01:18.379]  Believe me, last time you were here I said,
[03:01:19.079 --> 03:01:21.281]  You smell like goats, and you're like, well how do I know?
[03:01:21.521 --> 03:01:25.484]  I've sheared their little hooves a lot with my self-work on the ranch.
[03:01:25.964 --> 03:01:27.626]  I was like, you smell like goat crap, buddy.
[03:01:27.846 --> 03:01:29.507]  That wasn't a bad thing, it's a good thing.
[03:01:29.807 --> 03:01:30.788]  Man of the earth.
[03:01:30.908 --> 03:01:36.633]  We've got donkeys there that we rescued from the fires in 2011, and the donkeys are doing great, you know, we nursed them back to health.
[03:01:36.653 --> 03:01:40.256]  I don't want to pinpoint where you are, but your ranch had the big giant fires all around it in Bastrop.
[03:01:41.016 --> 03:01:52.844]  We are part of Central Texas, and our area got hit real hard by the fires, and we were lucky, you know, we didn't get burned out, but we rescued some animals from those fires.
[03:01:53.164 --> 03:02:04.511]  And today, I've got my own shooting range, so I do tactical firearms training, and on any given day, I'm either, you know, I'm walking in nature thinking about philosophy, or I'm shooting an AR-15.
[03:02:05.643 --> 03:02:06.604]  You know, and those go together.
[03:02:07.004 --> 03:02:09.205]  And you train with a bunch of military guys, too.
[03:02:09.225 --> 03:02:09.865]  I do, I do.
[03:02:10.145 --> 03:02:13.887]  I've got several instructors and I work with them on a frequent basis.
[03:02:13.947 --> 03:02:18.870]  We do house clearing, anti-terrorism, clearing vehicles and buses.
[03:02:18.890 --> 03:02:20.671]  And people think that's weird.
[03:02:20.731 --> 03:02:24.253]  As a man, your daughter's wife, everybody should be doing that.
[03:02:24.933 --> 03:02:25.834]  I mean, this is what we do.
[03:02:25.894 --> 03:02:27.095]  We're empowered.
[03:02:27.356 --> 03:02:29.698]  People always go, oh God, Alex, aren't you scared?
[03:02:29.758 --> 03:02:30.559]  Like, I'm scared.
[03:02:30.599 --> 03:02:31.820]  No, I'm fighting the evil.
[03:02:32.181 --> 03:02:32.841]  I'm empowered.
[03:02:33.542 --> 03:02:39.048]  Well, I know that right now, if something happened, I could pick up any weapon system, and I could run it, and I could play jams.
[03:02:39.709 --> 03:02:40.629]  I could do it, you know?
[03:02:41.070 --> 03:02:42.191]  Man, what would you do with this pen right now?
[03:02:43.533 --> 03:02:44.253]  I'm not going to tell you.
[03:02:44.273 --> 03:02:44.734]  A lot.
[03:02:46.312 --> 03:02:47.052]  I'm not going to tell you.
[03:02:47.413 --> 03:02:50.154]  But there's no one here to demonstrate it on anyway.
[03:02:50.634 --> 03:02:56.357]  But the point is, I know I can defend Texas, I can defend my home, I can defend my family, I can defend my country.
[03:02:56.757 --> 03:03:01.239]  And don't you think the globalists finally figured out, they thought because we were asleep we were weak.
[03:03:01.759 --> 03:03:03.560]  Now they figure out they've got a tiger by the tail.
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:04.781]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:03:05.282 --> 03:03:14.172]  Because again, if you decide to stand up and not give in, and you become a person, you explore logic and reason and spirituality.
[03:03:14.192 --> 03:03:18.297]  Well, the globalist Pentagon under Obama said our main enemy is not criminals.
[03:03:18.457 --> 03:03:19.618]  This was in a report five years ago.
[03:03:19.638 --> 03:03:22.362]  They said it's empowered individuals.
[03:03:23.393 --> 03:03:23.593]  Yes.
[03:03:24.333 --> 03:03:24.534]  Yes.
[03:03:25.194 --> 03:03:27.535]  Self-reliance is the key to freedom.
[03:03:28.115 --> 03:03:30.696]  And that's why that's an undercurrent of what I teach and what you teach.
[03:03:31.077 --> 03:03:33.378]  Self-reliance where you don't need all these doctors.
[03:03:33.418 --> 03:03:34.698]  You don't need all these drug companies.
[03:03:35.039 --> 03:03:36.639]  You don't need the government telling you what to eat.
[03:03:37.079 --> 03:03:38.760]  You don't need to call 9-1-1.
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:39.221]  Why?
[03:03:39.241 --> 03:03:40.501]  Because you can deal with it yourself.
[03:03:40.621 --> 03:03:42.982]  And it's not just the things Mother Nature and God gave us.
[03:03:43.543 --> 03:03:46.924]  It's that the studies all show a motivated brain on the warpath.
[03:03:47.164 --> 03:03:47.845]  You live longer.
[03:03:47.885 --> 03:03:48.505]  You're stronger.
[03:03:48.525 --> 03:03:50.426]  It's what it's about.
[03:03:50.646 --> 03:03:52.487]  You've got to have a mission.
[03:03:53.407 --> 03:04:00.574]  I say the firearms training, I mean people might think it's odd that I'm in the lab one day I'm doing science or I'm doing philosophy and then I'm training on an AR-15.
[03:04:01.615 --> 03:04:02.436]  How do those go together?
[03:04:02.516 --> 03:04:04.218]  And the answer is they go perfectly together.
[03:04:04.598 --> 03:04:05.579]  You play Battleship.
[03:04:06.465 --> 03:04:07.866]  Just aim small, miss small.
[03:04:08.667 --> 03:04:11.449]  The more you just shoot at smaller and smaller targets, the better you get.
[03:04:11.890 --> 03:04:13.031]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:04:13.711 --> 03:04:22.479]  My instructor the other day took me 15 yards away and said, put 10 rounds with your Glock 19 into the head, into this part of the target.
[03:04:22.499 --> 03:04:22.759]  10 rounds.
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:26.344]  And I put 10 rounds right there in that spot.
[03:04:26.924 --> 03:04:34.855]  And I was there when police were qualifying shooting and a cop comes over to me and he says, I've never seen cops shoot as good as you're shooting.
[03:04:34.875 --> 03:04:35.536]  What are you doing?
[03:04:35.897 --> 03:04:37.198]  And I said, I'm just practicing.
[03:04:37.870 --> 03:04:38.450]  I'm just training.
[03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:40.011]  Let's take a look at your gun.
[03:04:40.031 --> 03:04:41.151]  Let's see what you can do better.
[03:04:41.351 --> 03:04:43.272]  So I was helping the cops shoot better.
[03:04:43.652 --> 03:04:45.572]  Because they don't get a lot of good training, frankly.
[03:04:45.612 --> 03:04:47.093]  They need more training for the most part.
[03:04:47.633 --> 03:04:53.634]  But hey, this is all part of being a pro-liberty individual who loves life, loves liberty, and loves America.
[03:04:53.894 --> 03:04:54.415]  That's what I am.
[03:04:55.535 --> 03:04:56.255]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:04:56.275 --> 03:04:58.716]  We're not rolling over to Soros so he can have his way with us.
[03:04:58.736 --> 03:04:59.276]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.533 --> 03:05:04.274]  I'm so excited.
[03:05:04.334 --> 03:05:13.900]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:14.500 --> 03:05:19.664]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:20.004 --> 03:05:22.786]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:23.006 --> 03:05:31.752]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:33.873 --> 03:05:38.654]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:05:39.174 --> 03:05:41.955]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:42.095 --> 03:05:52.978]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:53.478 --> 03:05:54.758]  It is amazing!
[03:05:56.159 --> 03:06:01.120]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:06:06.946 --> 03:06:17.153]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:17.593 --> 03:06:22.797]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:24.781 --> 03:06:25.962]  We've just begun the fight.
[03:06:26.042 --> 03:06:27.483]  We're mobilizing the forces.
[03:06:27.863 --> 03:06:33.587]  We're activating the free souls out there of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood on terra firma.
[03:06:34.027 --> 03:06:34.988]  Mike Adams is here.
[03:06:35.048 --> 03:06:36.789]  We've got Roger Stone coming up in 10 minutes.
[03:06:37.149 --> 03:06:39.211]  He's loaded for bear with huge news.
[03:06:39.611 --> 03:06:41.192]  He published his receipts and stuff.
[03:06:41.212 --> 03:06:43.494]  When they said he was in England, he was in California.
[03:06:43.514 --> 03:06:45.275]  And they're, of course, ignoring all that.
[03:06:45.315 --> 03:06:48.537]  But it just shows the desperateness of Mueller and the rest of it.
[03:06:48.637 --> 03:06:51.779]  Kent, let's go to California and talk to Kent in California.
[03:06:51.819 --> 03:06:53.020]  Kent, you're a trooper.
[03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:54.521]  Thanks for holding her on the air with Mike Adams.
[03:06:55.962 --> 03:06:59.203]  Hey Alex and Mike, it's Kent Heckenlove there, right for the Boland Report.
[03:06:59.904 --> 03:07:00.204]  Awesome.
[03:07:00.224 --> 03:07:00.544]  Hey Kent.
[03:07:01.985 --> 03:07:02.605]  How you doing?
[03:07:02.885 --> 03:07:03.245]  Good, brother.
[03:07:03.285 --> 03:07:03.626]  All good.
[03:07:04.846 --> 03:07:05.467]  Good, good.
[03:07:05.587 --> 03:07:09.409]  So Mike, I wanted to ask you about Trump's plans for the vaccines.
[03:07:09.549 --> 03:07:18.634]  It seems like he's going after it with the conscience and religious freedom proposals, as well as looking at what's actually in vaccines.
[03:07:18.674 --> 03:07:19.374]  What are your thoughts?
[03:07:20.103 --> 03:07:24.927]  Well, Trump, there were indications that he was going to have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:07:25.267 --> 03:07:27.169]  as a possible advisor on vaccine safety.
[03:07:27.209 --> 03:07:28.230]  Now, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:33.755]  has done outstanding work, even though he and I might disagree on political issues.
[03:07:33.915 --> 03:07:35.416]  He has a family brain damaged.
[03:07:36.217 --> 03:07:37.017]  He saw it for himself.
[03:07:37.057 --> 03:07:37.698]  He's got that right.
[03:07:37.938 --> 03:07:39.820]  Which shows how a lot of liberals mean well.
[03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:41.161]  That's the equation.
[03:07:41.181 --> 03:07:42.522]  They mean well, but they're, you know.
[03:07:42.682 --> 03:07:45.024]  Well, RFK Jr., he's become a fighter.
[03:07:45.344 --> 03:07:56.472]  And his project, the World Mercury Project, I think it's at worldmercuryproject.org, he has done amazing work on vaccine safety and the mercury issue, and exposing the CDC criminality and cover-ups.
[03:07:56.853 --> 03:07:59.875]  So I have to give a big shout-out to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:07:59.915 --> 03:08:02.437]  today for joining this battle to protect children.
[03:08:02.457 --> 03:08:05.779]  And Trump kind of waffled early on, but he's got a lot to do.
[03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:07.441]  Looks like now he's starting to look at it.
[03:08:07.941 --> 03:08:10.682]  Yes, so if Trump will hook up with RFK Jr.
[03:08:10.762 --> 03:08:12.943]  on this issue, it will be to the benefit of everyone.
[03:08:13.323 --> 03:08:18.665]  Look, the CDC is a corrupt criminal cartel pushing dangerous, toxic, experimental vaccines.
[03:08:18.745 --> 03:08:23.487]  It came out in 2002, ABC News, that in 2000, they met and said, I would never give my grandkids this.
[03:08:23.827 --> 03:08:26.888]  How do we cover up the millions of autistic children we caused?
[03:08:27.068 --> 03:08:27.808]  And how do we stop it?
[03:08:27.828 --> 03:08:28.629]  Well, they never stopped it.
[03:08:29.129 --> 03:08:31.830]  And importantly, and by the way, Ken, I really appreciate your call.
[03:08:32.890 --> 03:08:37.912]  All of the pro-vaccine forces out there will try to say that we are all anti-vaccine or anti-science.
[03:08:38.332 --> 03:08:38.872]  Nonsense.
[03:08:39.232 --> 03:08:47.535]  We understand vaccine theory and immunology and... We're anti-liability protection and secret human testing and forced inoculation.
[03:08:48.095 --> 03:08:56.861]  And using human children for medical experiments, which the vaccine industry does routinely, and also the use of toxic chemicals and adjuvants in the vaccines.
[03:08:56.961 --> 03:08:57.301]  That's right.
[03:08:57.321 --> 03:08:57.741]  Thank you, Kent.
[03:08:57.761 --> 03:08:59.042]  We're going to move quick here.
[03:08:59.282 --> 03:09:00.703]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada.
[03:09:00.723 --> 03:09:01.164]  You're a trooper.
[03:09:01.264 --> 03:09:02.344]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:09:03.285 --> 03:09:04.586]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:09:05.506 --> 03:09:12.531]  Just to thank you both for your work and for also saving lives, which is really the greatest contribution to nature.
[03:09:13.598 --> 03:09:17.540]  It's not easy, but with your educating people on health, you do save lives.
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:37.129]  I wanted to make a point about America in the sense that both of you are well-versed in history, and it seems to me that if you look at the origins of America from the political structure, the separation from British rule, it was in part because Benjamin Franklin reported that the notes that were being used in the New World
[03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:49.118]  We're very successful, the economy was running, and it was the adamance to stop the trading of these notes in the New World that provoked 1776.
[03:09:49.758 --> 03:09:53.381]  I just want to draw your attention to something that happened in 1796.
[03:09:55.383 --> 03:10:05.150]  President Washington, in his farewell address, gave the instructions for the administration of America, and he was clearly not a globalist.
[03:10:05.672 --> 03:10:13.801]  He specifically gave instructions as to a new incoming president to how to run the experiment.
[03:10:13.861 --> 03:10:15.183]  No foreign entanglements!
[03:10:16.340 --> 03:10:16.960]  Exactly.
[03:10:17.281 --> 03:10:26.766]  And if you look at the Democratic Party today, they're so far removed from the founding concepts of America, even the presidency.
[03:10:27.066 --> 03:10:28.287]  They don't have candidatures.
[03:10:28.507 --> 03:10:29.767]  They don't have a policy.
[03:10:30.148 --> 03:10:34.170]  All they can do is hope that you will vote against a no for the president.
[03:10:34.490 --> 03:10:35.511]  He wears white shirts.
[03:10:35.731 --> 03:10:36.351]  He's a racist.
[03:10:36.551 --> 03:10:37.512]  Lives in a White House.
[03:10:37.772 --> 03:10:38.512]  He's a racist.
[03:10:39.153 --> 03:10:41.214]  These people have lost all bearing.
[03:10:41.294 --> 03:10:43.335]  If you all go back and read the 1796
[03:10:45.566 --> 03:10:47.388]  Farewell address by George Washington.
[03:10:48.249 --> 03:10:59.382]  And then maybe they will deserve to be a political party, because right now, with George Soros and all of these minions of materialistic, anti-spiritual people, anti-life people... Well, that's me.
[03:10:59.683 --> 03:11:00.664]  I'm not authoritarian.
[03:11:00.684 --> 03:11:01.405]  They're the authoritarian.
[03:11:01.825 --> 03:11:03.147]  They're trying to overthrow the country.
[03:11:04.724 --> 03:11:05.565]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[03:11:05.605 --> 03:11:06.346]  They want a race war.
[03:11:06.387 --> 03:11:08.009]  They are an outside, seditious group.
[03:11:08.930 --> 03:11:11.714]  It is negligence to let them do this.
[03:11:11.855 --> 03:11:13.597]  I mean, they're trying to silence us.
[03:11:14.038 --> 03:11:15.380]  When you start the argument...
[03:11:16.263 --> 03:11:17.984]  To enslave and silence.
[03:11:18.525 --> 03:11:19.586]  Those rules aren't there now.
[03:11:19.646 --> 03:11:20.607]  We silence you.
[03:11:21.107 --> 03:11:25.631]  When you walk into a bank with a gun and start waving around saying, give me the money, I shoot your ass.
[03:11:26.031 --> 03:11:27.072]  I didn't shoot you first.
[03:11:27.332 --> 03:11:28.533]  You came in waving a gun around.
[03:11:29.654 --> 03:11:37.040]  There is a cycle of history where countries that have freedom and abundance, of course, become complacent and they become privileged.
[03:11:37.100 --> 03:11:41.164]  And this is what we're seeing with snowflakes and cry bullies, this privileged mindset
[03:11:41.724 --> 03:11:50.771]  And if you think about it, many of the early Americans, such as George Washington, escaped that sort of defeating philosophy in order to create America and get away from it.
[03:11:51.151 --> 03:11:52.492]  But that cycle is repeating again.
[03:11:52.512 --> 03:11:53.713]  We have to rise up.
[03:11:53.733 --> 03:11:58.517]  He wouldn't kiss the ring of the British regulars and complain, so they wouldn't let him in.
[03:11:58.537 --> 03:11:59.898]  And then he'd prove them wrong.
[03:12:00.478 --> 03:12:08.845]  But America today, so many of the left-wing masses have become complacent, historically illiterate, dumbed down, chemically contaminated.
[03:12:09.785 --> 03:12:16.673]  Do you know why the globalist Rockefeller goes to all the universities and tries to get all the big brains and hire them while they tried to hire me while they tried to hire you?
[03:12:17.233 --> 03:12:22.559]  They actually write the British history books in on their army or college that they wish they'd have accepted George Washington.
[03:12:22.819 --> 03:12:24.301]  That made them actually open up.
[03:12:25.322 --> 03:12:28.663]  Instead of their inbred British elites whose eyes point different directions, like Bezos.
[03:12:28.683 --> 03:12:31.863]  I'm sorry, that's just a known British royalty trait, is your eyes point different directions.
[03:12:33.444 --> 03:12:36.564]  And they realize now that they would have just let him in.
[03:12:37.325 --> 03:12:41.265]  But he was obviously way better than all of them, but he just didn't play the games.
[03:12:42.066 --> 03:12:44.406]  I can't get past the eyes in different directions, man.
[03:12:44.426 --> 03:12:45.246]  What about the third eye?
[03:12:45.266 --> 03:12:46.847]  Is that also pointing in a different direction?
[03:12:46.887 --> 03:12:48.307]  No, no, you can Google this.
[03:12:48.507 --> 03:12:53.288]  Search engine the British, they saw it as a royalty to have like a lazy eye from inbreeding.
[03:12:53.988 --> 03:12:54.829]  No, it's not a mean thing.
[03:12:54.869 --> 03:12:56.349]  It's a known genetic inbreeding trait.
[03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:57.250]  The Egyptians had it.
[03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:58.150]  The Gypsies have it.
[03:12:58.170 --> 03:12:58.711]  It's very sad.
[03:12:59.051 --> 03:13:02.152]  Most of the British royalty's eyes don't point in the right direction.
[03:13:02.252 --> 03:13:06.495]  If your eyes point in the wrong direction, like, oh my god, this guy's going to be an admiral.
[03:13:09.089 --> 03:13:15.674]  It's like a marine creature of the deep with iPods pointing in different directions, trying to rule the world as an octopus.
[03:13:16.455 --> 03:13:16.875]  I don't know.
[03:13:16.895 --> 03:13:19.057]  They call it an aristocratic eye.
[03:13:19.257 --> 03:13:21.019]  The globalist squid agenda.
[03:13:21.759 --> 03:13:22.660]  Thank you for the call.
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:23.821]  Yeah, thank you, Carlos.
[03:13:23.841 --> 03:13:24.882]  Let's take another call here.
[03:13:25.542 --> 03:13:28.705]  Let's talk to... Jeff, is it?
[03:13:29.005 --> 03:13:30.166]  Or who are you talking to?
[03:13:30.206 --> 03:13:31.667]  James is next, Louisiana.
[03:13:32.007 --> 03:13:32.928]  Go ahead, James.
[03:13:35.814 --> 03:13:36.574]  Hello, James.
[03:13:36.634 --> 03:13:37.815]  James for InfoWars.
[03:13:37.835 --> 03:13:38.415]  Go ahead, James.
[03:13:38.435 --> 03:13:38.795]  You're on the air.
[03:13:38.815 --> 03:13:41.116]  All right, James is gone.
[03:13:41.177 --> 03:13:42.277]  We'll go to Jeff, then.
[03:13:42.597 --> 03:13:44.638]  As you said, Jeff in Vancouver.
[03:13:44.658 --> 03:13:45.499]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[03:13:45.539 --> 03:13:46.459]  Go ahead with Mike Adams.
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:49.140]  Hey, thanks, guys.
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:50.141]  Great show today.
[03:13:50.421 --> 03:13:53.342]  Just got a good dose of red pill and white light.
[03:13:53.943 --> 03:13:54.503]  Just loving it.
[03:13:54.743 --> 03:13:55.283]  Thank you, sir.
[03:13:55.343 --> 03:13:58.785]  Love your spiritual assessment of what's going on.
[03:13:58.985 --> 03:14:03.347]  You know, it's sometimes a delicate topic to approach with people.
[03:14:03.877 --> 03:14:08.440]  But it's truth, and what happens in belief is acted out on the earth.
[03:14:08.500 --> 03:14:18.026]  So, I just wanted to just give a thank you as a Canadian to those of you that value the First Amendment.
[03:14:18.647 --> 03:14:21.789]  And, you know, just this show today is all about the First Amendment.
[03:14:21.829 --> 03:14:27.832]  That's why the First Amendment exists, and is so that truth and light can come through.
[03:14:28.653 --> 03:14:31.415]  And, you know, just to put a prophetic cherry on
[03:14:32.023 --> 03:14:50.001]  On what's being said today, the book of Revelation says that the Christians, children of God, they defeated the devil by the blood of the lamb, or what Christ did for humanity, the word of their testimony, and loving their life not unto death.
[03:14:50.061 --> 03:14:54.465]  And I really see that in both of you, and so I just want to say God bless you with that.
[03:14:57.281 --> 03:14:58.382]  Just asking if you agree with that.
[03:14:58.582 --> 03:14:59.844]  Brother, I totally agree with you.
[03:15:00.144 --> 03:15:01.025]  We totally agree with you.
[03:15:01.205 --> 03:15:03.548]  And people are ready for this truth now.
[03:15:03.708 --> 03:15:06.611]  Everyone, even people that aren't religious, are saying it's spiritual.
[03:15:06.651 --> 03:15:07.332]  We feel it.
[03:15:08.093 --> 03:15:09.154]  There's a choice happening.
[03:15:09.194 --> 03:15:10.135]  People are getting crazy.
[03:15:10.435 --> 03:15:11.536]  Mental illness is expanding.
[03:15:12.057 --> 03:15:12.317]  It's here.
[03:15:13.158 --> 03:15:13.458]  It's here.
[03:15:13.478 --> 03:15:14.339]  This is the big time.
[03:15:14.980 --> 03:15:16.541]  The spiritual war is on.
[03:15:16.901 --> 03:15:19.664]  Your call is absolutely right on target, Jeff.
[03:15:19.864 --> 03:15:20.784]  I really appreciate you calling.
[03:15:21.225 --> 03:15:22.426]  And we do love life.
[03:15:22.626 --> 03:15:23.307]  We love liberty.
[03:15:23.407 --> 03:15:31.613]  I mean, you said you could see it in our speech and in our words and in the way that we have passion for what we do.
[03:15:31.974 --> 03:15:35.417]  And we're committed till death because spiritual death is what matters.
[03:15:36.077 --> 03:15:38.259]  And not letting them have control of our lives.
[03:15:38.639 --> 03:15:39.180]  Coming up!
[03:15:40.424 --> 03:15:41.224]  Great job, Mike Adams.
[03:15:41.244 --> 03:15:41.484]  Thank you.
[03:15:41.524 --> 03:15:42.305]  Great job of the callers.
[03:15:42.365 --> 03:15:44.106]  I apologize to Mike and Oregon and James.
[03:15:44.126 --> 03:15:46.687]  I bet Roger won't take your calls.
[03:15:46.727 --> 03:15:47.407]  He loves taking calls.
[03:15:47.687 --> 03:15:49.588]  He's got big news on so many fronts.
[03:15:49.968 --> 03:15:51.328]  Trump and the military to the border.
[03:15:51.669 --> 03:15:52.769]  Delivering on that promise.
[03:15:52.849 --> 03:15:53.509]  So much more.
[03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:54.790]  Spread the live links.
[03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:55.270]  It's up to you.
[03:15:55.290 --> 03:15:56.290]  We're going to beat these censors.
[03:15:56.611 --> 03:15:57.591]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:57.631 --> 03:15:58.391]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:58.411 --> 03:15:58.811]  Thanks, Mike.
[03:15:59.212 --> 03:16:00.632]  Thank you.
[03:16:01.953 --> 03:16:06.855]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[03:16:08.024 --> 03:16:16.211]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[03:16:18.693 --> 03:16:24.818]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[03:16:26.219 --> 03:16:28.762]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[03:16:29.562 --> 03:16:32.965]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[03:16:33.926 --> 03:16:36.048]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[03:16:37.782 --> 03:16:42.964]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[03:16:44.884 --> 03:16:51.506]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[03:16:52.467 --> 03:16:53.467]  It's up to us personally.
[03:16:54.867 --> 03:17:01.710]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[03:17:02.230 --> 03:17:03.510]  I expected that to happen.
[03:17:04.691 --> 03:17:06.031]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:17:08.021 --> 03:17:18.948]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[03:17:19.649 --> 03:17:21.190]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[03:17:21.890 --> 03:17:33.518]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[03:17:34.098 --> 03:17:36.280]  And we've already come so far together
[03:17:37.301 --> 03:17:46.323]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[03:17:46.883 --> 03:17:52.305]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[03:17:53.445 --> 03:18:01.307]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:11.817]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[03:18:12.277 --> 03:18:13.798]  That's a conservative estimate.
[03:18:14.799 --> 03:18:17.461]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[03:18:18.242 --> 03:18:20.083]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[03:18:20.103 --> 03:18:25.007]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[03:18:26.108 --> 03:18:36.884]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[03:18:36.925 --> 03:18:40.890]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[03:18:42.313 --> 03:18:42.953]  Our game changing.
[03:18:43.373 --> 03:18:44.874]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[03:18:45.114 --> 03:18:47.655]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[03:18:48.055 --> 03:18:49.195]  The other equation of probiotic.
[03:18:49.256 --> 03:18:52.837]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PolarStore.com.
[03:18:53.137 --> 03:18:58.639]  We've got the real red pill that's got preglanone that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[03:18:59.219 --> 03:19:03.583]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids, it just does incredible things.
[03:19:04.004 --> 03:19:05.465]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[03:19:05.485 --> 03:19:08.468]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[03:19:08.488 --> 03:19:11.070]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:19:11.551 --> 03:19:16.375]  That's 4-5-a-colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[03:19:17.016 --> 03:19:19.679]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[03:19:20.399 --> 03:19:28.123]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of little silver out there.
[03:19:28.563 --> 03:19:35.466]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[03:19:35.506 --> 03:19:36.807]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[03:19:37.007 --> 03:19:38.188]  You can swallow it as well.
[03:19:38.588 --> 03:19:44.571]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[03:19:45.171 --> 03:19:46.552]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:19:46.572 --> 03:19:56.176]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:19:56.516 --> 03:19:59.577]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:20:05.979 --> 03:20:08.661]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.259 --> 03:20:24.404]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:20:24.444 --> 03:20:27.508]  You're listening to Roger Stone on N4.
[03:20:27.568 --> 03:20:28.709]  Welcome back!
[03:20:32.688 --> 03:20:38.014]  You're at the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:38.715 --> 03:20:43.600]  Honored to get the baton from my friend and ally, Alex Jones.
[03:20:44.662 --> 03:20:53.111]  If you're following the news, you know that InfoWars and Alex Jones are under unprecedented attack from the censors.
[03:20:53.752 --> 03:20:56.214]  You see, their strategy is very clear.
[03:20:56.374 --> 03:20:59.816]  It's called lawfare instead of warfare.
[03:21:00.396 --> 03:21:15.807]  They go out and they file a large, well-funded number of phony lawsuits, harassment, meritless lawsuits, knowing that just moving in court for dismissal can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:21:16.347 --> 03:21:23.172]  Then they turn around and use these phony lawsuits as their rationale for kneecapping us
[03:21:23.932 --> 03:21:27.394]  At YouTube, on Facebook, on Google.
[03:21:28.074 --> 03:21:29.054]  It's a game.
[03:21:29.415 --> 03:21:34.277]  The good news is that our president, Donald Trump, is on to their game.
[03:21:34.697 --> 03:21:41.300]  And he's taking a hard look at the Bezoses and the Zuckerbergs and the Schmitz.
[03:21:42.300 --> 03:21:55.165]  And the Dempsies and others who use their Silicon Valley operations to strangle the First Amendment and hopefully, for them, close us down here at InfoWars.
[03:21:56.025 --> 03:22:04.709]  Regardless of how this fight comes out, Alex Jones and InfoWars have to defend in a myriad now of these phony lawsuits.
[03:22:05.689 --> 03:22:10.614]  I can tell you firsthand, this can cost millions of dollars.
[03:22:11.294 --> 03:22:30.271]  Already, we're at a point where because of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee investigations, the Mueller investigation, the Senate Judiciary Committee investigation, my own legal bills are well over a half a million dollars over nothing.
[03:22:30.771 --> 03:22:31.352]  Zero.
[03:22:31.752 --> 03:22:32.132]  Nada.
[03:22:32.853 --> 03:22:38.438]  What we have is a crazed mainstream media fake news lynch mob.
[03:22:38.858 --> 03:22:48.867]  And whether it is Alex Jones grooming InfoWars staffers for gay sex, one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read,
[03:22:49.828 --> 03:23:07.220]  Or whether it is Roger Stone went on InfoWars August 1st and told Alex Jones that the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary would be devastated, and then the next day he flew to London to meet Assange.
[03:23:07.700 --> 03:23:10.602]  Well, the problem with that is the first part's correct.
[03:23:11.223 --> 03:23:16.986]  I did predict that the revelations would be devastating to Alex Jones on August 1st.
[03:23:17.987 --> 03:23:18.607]  And they were.
[03:23:19.208 --> 03:23:32.053]  As far as August 1st, 2nd and 3rd, a time that CNN and the Wall Street Journal intimate that I was in London meeting with Julian Assange, well, I was in California.
[03:23:32.573 --> 03:23:38.575]  And I produced the airline records, the credit card records, the phone records to prove it.
[03:23:39.476 --> 03:23:40.156]  Ah, they say.
[03:23:40.576 --> 03:23:44.638]  But Stone stayed at the London Hotel in West Hollywood.
[03:23:44.718 --> 03:23:46.699]  So you see, he was in London.
[03:23:48.783 --> 03:23:55.630]  The email that this reporter at the Wall Street alludes to isn't even correctly quoted.
[03:23:55.810 --> 03:23:56.831]  It's misquoted.
[03:23:57.572 --> 03:24:01.997]  And it's a continuation of the same fake news.
[03:24:02.397 --> 03:24:05.180]  Roger Stone email about Assange dinner.
[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:06.461]  This is a perfect example.
[03:24:07.142 --> 03:24:14.428]  So, recognize from the get-go that we here at InfoWars need your support as never before.
[03:24:15.028 --> 03:24:16.690]  Make no bones about it.
[03:24:16.850 --> 03:24:21.594]  They want to strangle InfoWars because we're the cutting edge.
[03:24:22.134 --> 03:24:25.157]  We're the ones who go where no one else is willing to go.
[03:24:25.577 --> 03:24:28.980]  We are willing to support the truth no matter what it takes.
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:32.402]  And we are completely listener and viewer supported.
[03:24:32.902 --> 03:24:39.507]  So go to the InfoWars store now and you'll see some of the most incredible specials we've ever had.
[03:24:40.188 --> 03:24:46.833]  Right off the bat, you have the new Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle, which comes in several sizes.
[03:24:46.933 --> 03:24:55.159]  Now, the entire Super Blue range of oral products are among the very best things you can get at InfoWars.
[03:24:56.019 --> 03:25:02.845]  And the health attributes of silver in the correct dosages have been known for centuries.
[03:25:03.566 --> 03:25:05.828]  I'm a big fan of Silver Bullet.
[03:25:06.008 --> 03:25:07.369]  I use it every day.
[03:25:07.849 --> 03:25:17.458]  Now I realize I can get my silver in this immune gargle, which in this time of changing seasons can really help boost the immune system.
[03:25:18.444 --> 03:25:25.671]  Recently, you may have seen Alex Jones have been talking about the combination of the Red Pill and Brain Formula Plus.
[03:25:26.331 --> 03:25:30.956]  This is the perfect synergy between mind and body.
[03:25:31.416 --> 03:25:36.881]  And the Mind and Body Challenge Pack, both of these great products today, can be had at $59.90.
[03:25:38.903 --> 03:25:41.824]  That's a retail price of $119, folks.
[03:25:41.844 --> 03:25:44.206]  You won't get prices better than this.
[03:25:44.646 --> 03:25:56.652]  And when you buy at the Infowars store, you not only support our fight against censorship, our fight to be heard, but you also help fund the expansion right here at Infowars.
[03:25:57.512 --> 03:26:03.034]  After the Alex Jones Show today, I'm going to jump over to the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer.
[03:26:03.754 --> 03:26:20.740]  If you like the War Room, if you like what David Knight is doing with The Real News in the morning, if you enjoy the iconic Alex Jones Show midday every day, well then support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these great products.
[03:26:21.300 --> 03:26:40.048]  Whether it is the Super Blue line of oral products, whether it is Survival Shield at 25% off, whether it is the Red Pill Brain Force Plus combination, every time you make a purchase, you help us finance our expansion here at InfoWars.
[03:26:40.768 --> 03:27:05.467]  Now the other thing to remember is if you're not in the market for a product right now, you can go to the donate button right there at the InfoWars store and send a generous contribution knowing that we are going to have literally millions of dollars in legal expenses in the weeks and months ahead as we beat back the libtard lawsuits that are designed to kneecap us.
[03:27:06.187 --> 03:27:14.110]  Again, meritless, frivolous lawsuits that are designed for harassment and to bankrupt us.
[03:27:14.530 --> 03:27:17.731]  So please take a minute and go to the InfoWars store now.
[03:27:18.532 --> 03:27:23.934]  We have still holding on our phone lines Mike in Oregon, also James in Louisiana.
[03:27:24.794 --> 03:27:29.355]  Our phone number, 1-888-201-2244.
[03:27:29.415 --> 03:27:32.396]  That's 1-888-201-2244.
[03:27:34.397 --> 03:27:37.638]  I'm going to be taking your calls on the other side.
[03:27:38.798 --> 03:27:45.900]  We're going to try to get as many calls in as we can, because I, among others, love the dialogue.
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:49.121]  I like to hear what's on the minds of Infowarriors.
[03:27:49.721 --> 03:28:03.106]  And with so much going on, we can answer important questions about what the President is doing, whether he is changing tactics, for example, on the question of immunization and vaccinations.
[03:28:04.232 --> 03:28:08.715]  Good news there by Mike Adams in the first segment, and so on.
[03:28:08.796 --> 03:28:12.218]  So please, folks, go to the InfoWars store.
[03:28:12.639 --> 03:28:16.081]  Help us for this extraordinary fight for freedom.
[03:28:17.242 --> 03:28:21.625]  Today, of course, commemorates the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[03:28:22.006 --> 03:28:30.853]  We have a special segment coming up later on the War Room to examine that murder and look at exactly who killed Dr. King.
[03:28:31.593 --> 03:28:36.101]  It's not James Earl Jones, as the government would like you to believe.
[03:28:36.521 --> 03:28:38.965]  So you have that to look forward to.
[03:28:39.246 --> 03:28:41.429]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:41.890 --> 03:28:44.555]  I'm Roger Stone, and we'll be right back.
[03:29:02.014 --> 03:29:03.395]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:03.675 --> 03:29:04.956]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.156 --> 03:29:06.056]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:06.356 --> 03:29:12.120]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:12.340 --> 03:29:18.063]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:18.263 --> 03:29:35.110]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:37.632]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:37.992 --> 03:29:39.193]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:39.473 --> 03:29:40.174]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:40.514 --> 03:29:41.135]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:41.415 --> 03:29:43.257]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[03:29:43.517 --> 03:29:50.643]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer, you can save $20 off the retail price and get free shipping.
[03:29:50.803 --> 03:29:55.827]  This is a limited time offer, so order your unit today and receive free shipping and $20 off.
[03:29:56.007 --> 03:29:58.569]  Go to infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:30:13.004 --> 03:30:22.049]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him, and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[03:30:22.549 --> 03:30:31.434]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[03:30:31.994 --> 03:30:36.916]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[03:30:37.416 --> 03:30:53.743]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[03:30:54.343 --> 03:30:58.365]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[03:30:59.085 --> 03:30:59.285]  No.
[03:30:59.846 --> 03:31:05.472]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[03:31:06.413 --> 03:31:12.520]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:15.223]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[03:31:16.424 --> 03:31:20.247]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[03:31:20.287 --> 03:31:23.248]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[03:31:23.268 --> 03:31:24.469]  I always call her Losh.
[03:31:25.270 --> 03:31:26.210]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[03:31:26.390 --> 03:31:26.971]  Dana Lash.
[03:31:26.991 --> 03:31:28.932]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[03:31:29.833 --> 03:31:30.293]  Great lady.
[03:31:30.833 --> 03:31:32.574]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA.
[03:31:32.594 --> 03:31:37.337]  But the left wants to basically kill and says she's a witch and burn her, literally.
[03:31:38.958 --> 03:31:42.921]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[03:31:43.661 --> 03:31:44.782]  George Soros' outfit.
[03:31:45.888 --> 03:31:55.997]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association is spending money with Alex Jones, like they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[03:31:56.637 --> 03:31:57.638]  No, morons.
[03:31:58.379 --> 03:31:59.379]  I like that ad.
[03:32:00.460 --> 03:32:04.484]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[03:32:04.804 --> 03:32:07.126]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[03:32:07.166 --> 03:32:08.367]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[03:32:09.228 --> 03:32:10.088]  Comprende?
[03:32:14.125 --> 03:32:16.026]  I pay to air the NRA.
[03:32:17.107 --> 03:32:17.707]  Figure that out?
[03:32:18.567 --> 03:32:20.028]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[03:32:20.769 --> 03:32:22.109]  I'm not doing this for money.
[03:32:22.770 --> 03:32:24.310]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[03:32:24.991 --> 03:32:28.293]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[03:32:28.653 --> 03:32:30.634]  It's about my children and the future.
[03:32:31.314 --> 03:32:32.235]  I'm a kamikaze.
[03:32:33.195 --> 03:32:35.056]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[03:32:35.356 --> 03:32:36.697]  I don't care how you come after me.
[03:32:36.877 --> 03:32:37.778]  I'm committed.
[03:32:38.318 --> 03:32:42.160]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[03:32:44.989 --> 03:32:48.311]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[03:32:48.331 --> 03:32:56.317]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:05.963 --> 03:33:08.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:27.600]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:28.161 --> 03:33:29.763]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:32.655 --> 03:33:33.376]  Welcome back.
[03:33:34.216 --> 03:33:37.678]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:38.278 --> 03:33:41.520]  So with no further ado, let's go right to the phones.
[03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:44.201]  We have Mike in Oregon calling in.
[03:33:44.661 --> 03:33:47.042]  Mike, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:47.443 --> 03:33:48.443]  What's on your mind?
[03:33:50.124 --> 03:33:50.444]  Yes.
[03:33:50.524 --> 03:33:51.345]  Hi, Roger.
[03:33:51.365 --> 03:33:53.766]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[03:33:55.827 --> 03:33:59.849]  And I wanted to talk about the FBI.
[03:34:01.480 --> 03:34:14.326]  And how I I don't know how people think they are a good organization or lawful organization at all.
[03:34:16.708 --> 03:34:18.608]  I think they're out of control.
[03:34:18.628 --> 03:34:26.752]  And what they're doing with the special counsel.
[03:34:28.053 --> 03:34:29.794]  What they tried to do with the election.
[03:34:31.071 --> 03:34:34.213]  And their involvement in school shooting.
[03:34:35.815 --> 03:34:49.804]  It seems like they're always behind the scenes at so many, you know, subversive activities.
[03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:55.482]  Well, Mike, first of all, I want to thank you for your call.
[03:34:55.803 --> 03:35:02.549]  A correction here, by the way, for callers, the correct number to call us now on the Alex Jones Show is 877-787-2539.
[03:35:02.609 --> 03:35:02.869]  That's 877-787-2539.
[03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:04.351]  Let me address Mike's call.
[03:35:14.235 --> 03:35:23.241]  The FBI was originally set up with a noble intent, and for many, many years, they had a reputation for honesty and integrity.
[03:35:23.901 --> 03:35:43.134]  Unfortunately, over time, the FBI has become politicized, now to the point where they are entirely politicized, and therefore the American people can justly wonder whether they're acting as a political organ for the deep state, or whether they're a legitimate, unbiased law enforcement organization.
[03:35:43.976 --> 03:36:04.484]  The text messages of the FBI agent Peter Stroke and his on-the-payroll girlfriend, I think, open the world's eyes to the incredible abuses that have gone on at the FBI under both James Comey and Robert Mueller.
[03:36:05.184 --> 03:36:06.084]  What's the answer?
[03:36:06.585 --> 03:36:09.926]  The answer is a top-to-bottom housecleaning
[03:36:11.263 --> 03:36:12.303]  At the FBI.
[03:36:12.784 --> 03:36:20.707]  The answer is a new FBI director who is someone who is known to and loyal to this president.
[03:36:21.388 --> 03:36:26.570]  I think former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would be an excellent choice.
[03:36:27.050 --> 03:36:29.991]  Someone outside the Washington buddy system.
[03:36:30.392 --> 03:36:33.013]  Someone with a reputation for integrity.
[03:36:33.573 --> 03:36:34.733]  Terrific question, Mike.
[03:36:34.813 --> 03:36:36.934]  Thanks so much for your call.
[03:36:37.254 --> 03:36:41.836]  Let's go now to James in Louisiana, one of my favorite states.
[03:36:42.796 --> 03:36:48.118]  I'm kind of craving some seafood gumbo, even as we speak, just thinking about it.
[03:36:48.238 --> 03:36:51.699]  But James, what's your question for the Alex Jones Show?
[03:36:52.739 --> 03:36:53.959]  Oh, yeah, Mr. Rogers.
[03:36:54.499 --> 03:37:02.462]  Man, well, really, I'm kind of thinking, well, I hear Alex talk about it all the time.
[03:37:03.214 --> 03:37:10.602]  Well, James, we have a little audio problem here, but let me address your question.
[03:37:25.759 --> 03:37:36.947]  The thing that first impressed me about Alex Jones when we met for the first time back at the 50th anniversary of the John F. Kennedy assassination was his grasp on world history.
[03:37:37.907 --> 03:37:40.909]  Alex Jones is extraordinarily well-read.
[03:37:40.929 --> 03:37:44.071]  He understands the history of the deep state.
[03:37:44.111 --> 03:37:47.754]  He understands the long-term plans of the globalists.
[03:37:48.194 --> 03:37:55.700]  But he also has studied history, the Greeks, the Romans, our own history, the seeds of 1776.
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:14.575]  And therefore, he approaches these political issues in a way that you cannot find them approached at, say, CNN, where some 23-year-old reporter has no sense of history and does not understand that past is prologue.
[03:38:15.336 --> 03:38:20.060]  Alex Jones is absolutely right about the corruption of the Deep State.
[03:38:20.821 --> 03:38:28.608]  How can it be that President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush had the same person as their Defense Secretary?
[03:38:29.589 --> 03:38:33.633]  How could it be that they had the same person as their FBI Director?
[03:38:34.855 --> 03:38:36.016]  Does that make any sense?
[03:38:36.076 --> 03:38:45.660]  If you have a governing philosophy, then theoretically you would be appointing men and women who supported your philosophy, not the philosophy of your predecessor.
[03:38:46.720 --> 03:38:50.742]  Except if the Bushes and the Clintons are in fact identical.
[03:38:51.903 --> 03:39:00.447]  If in fact their public bickering and their attempts to sound different is a kabuki act to put the American people to sleep.
[03:39:01.607 --> 03:39:21.082]  I've come to the conclusion that the right-left divide is a Hegelian device that is used to distract our attention from the fact that the country has a ruling elite that isn't really ideological, other than the fact that they believe in the control of our lives and access to great wealth.
[03:39:22.199 --> 03:39:25.582]  These are the deep state players that you refer to.
[03:39:26.704 --> 03:39:32.429]  And it doesn't seem to matter whether Republicans or Democrats win our national elections.
[03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:39.356]  We continue the policies that have enmeshed us in endless foreign wars.
[03:39:39.997 --> 03:39:42.719]  Where our inherent national interests are not clear.
[03:39:43.660 --> 03:39:51.866]  The complete erosion of our civil liberties, reading our emails, monitoring our phone calls, collecting our metadata.
[03:39:52.527 --> 03:39:57.411]  Trade policies that have ruined our economy and sucked the jobs out of America.
[03:39:58.231 --> 03:40:05.917]  Immigration policies that have made our streets and neighborhoods and cities and now even rural areas unsafe.
[03:40:07.078 --> 03:40:12.842]  And economic policies that under Barack Obama are economy virtually ground to a hall.
[03:40:13.723 --> 03:40:19.707]  Now, suddenly, one man has stepped forward who is not part of this broken system.
[03:40:20.628 --> 03:40:24.370]  One man who is not beholden to any special interest.
[03:40:25.111 --> 03:40:30.374]  One man who is not party to the bad decisions of the last 30 years.
[03:40:31.215 --> 03:40:34.637]  And that is what's driving the globalists crazy.
[03:40:35.498 --> 03:40:38.141]  Donald Trump understands the silent majority.
[03:40:38.481 --> 03:40:41.184]  He understands the people in flyover country.
[03:40:41.524 --> 03:40:44.206]  He understands the average info warrior.
[03:40:44.647 --> 03:40:46.168]  And he is at one with us.
[03:40:47.028 --> 03:40:47.969]  He's a patriot.
[03:40:48.629 --> 03:40:49.850]  He loves this country.
[03:40:50.350 --> 03:40:51.972]  He believes in Americana.
[03:40:52.452 --> 03:40:54.714]  He believes in American exceptionalism.
[03:40:55.174 --> 03:40:59.537]  He believes that this is the greatest nation in the history of the world.
[03:41:00.038 --> 03:41:06.702]  And that although we are not perfect, we are, as Ronald Reagan would say, a shining city on the hill.
[03:41:07.803 --> 03:41:13.685]  Andy understands that there are those around the globe who would seek to tear us down.
[03:41:14.565 --> 03:41:19.307]  We're going to continue here at InfoWars to be a voice against the globalists.
[03:41:19.727 --> 03:41:34.312]  We're going to continue to fight those who would seek to censor us off of YouTube and off of Facebook and off of Google and all of the other important social media platforms controlled by our friends at Silicon Valley.
[03:41:34.952 --> 03:41:37.614]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:41:37.955 --> 03:41:42.498]  We're going to continue to mock the CNNs and the MSNBCs.
[03:41:42.798 --> 03:41:48.383]  They turn out unmitigated BS and try to convince you that it's news.
[03:41:49.204 --> 03:41:54.368]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:41:55.028 --> 03:41:57.911]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:41:58.373 --> 03:42:01.915]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[03:42:02.515 --> 03:42:13.801]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:42:14.442 --> 03:42:25.148]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[03:42:25.788 --> 03:42:31.211]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[03:42:31.812 --> 03:42:37.335]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books, and of course our Neutro-Certicals.
[03:42:37.855 --> 03:42:39.276]  It's a 360 win.
[03:42:39.656 --> 03:42:44.960]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:46.601]  So please go to the site now.
[03:42:47.041 --> 03:42:48.622]  We need your support.
[03:43:02.771 --> 03:43:09.046]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:43:09.901 --> 03:43:22.326]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[03:43:22.986 --> 03:43:33.471]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[03:43:34.051 --> 03:43:40.832]  InfoWarsLife's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[03:43:41.433 --> 03:43:55.536]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[03:43:56.076 --> 03:43:58.756]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:44:02.338 --> 03:44:05.759]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:44:06.079 --> 03:44:12.842]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:44:13.142 --> 03:44:17.864]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:44:17.884 --> 03:44:18.404]  It's very simple.
[03:44:18.624 --> 03:44:20.765]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:44:21.125 --> 03:44:22.986]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:44:23.086 --> 03:44:24.846]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:44:24.906 --> 03:44:25.927]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:44:26.047 --> 03:44:26.787]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:44:31.749 --> 03:44:34.630]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:44:34.770 --> 03:44:38.911]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:44:39.211 --> 03:44:43.032]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:44:43.052 --> 03:44:46.473]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:44:46.934 --> 03:44:49.854]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:44:50.095 --> 03:44:53.496]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:44:53.736 --> 03:44:56.036]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:44:56.336 --> 03:44:57.017]  It's amazing.
[03:44:57.337 --> 03:44:59.777]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:09.282]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[03:45:09.742 --> 03:45:11.282]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[03:45:11.302 --> 03:45:14.603]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[03:45:16.324 --> 03:45:20.425]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[03:45:21.770 --> 03:45:25.553]  Okay, we want to first take him off the air, and then we're going to take everybody off.
[03:45:25.734 --> 03:45:26.554]  This is all admitted.
[03:45:26.594 --> 03:45:27.615]  I told you that a month ago.
[03:45:27.695 --> 03:45:28.936]  It's all happening, as you see.
[03:45:29.297 --> 03:45:32.059]  So, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, go there.
[03:45:32.079 --> 03:45:33.100]  Get the t-shirt of the month.
[03:45:33.180 --> 03:45:36.843]  Trump, Pence, 2020, with the new slogan, Keeping America Great.
[03:45:36.863 --> 03:45:37.864]  I haven't even done an ad for that.
[03:45:37.944 --> 03:45:38.445]  I'm so busy.
[03:45:38.485 --> 03:45:40.366]  That's a one-month limited edition shirt.
[03:45:40.506 --> 03:45:42.028]  It's gone in just a few weeks.
[03:45:42.268 --> 03:45:43.689]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:43.829 --> 03:45:46.532]  In these lawsuits, Alex, I know the costs.
[03:45:47.052 --> 03:45:51.036]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight component lawsuits.
[03:45:51.477 --> 03:46:00.766]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight lawsuits against you and against InfoWars, because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[03:46:01.307 --> 03:46:10.596]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button.
[03:46:11.016 --> 03:46:27.743]  If you just want to help fight for freedom, if you like what we're doing here, and you're not, just don't happen to be in the market for products that you've already got them or you're on auto ship, you can just go to the donate button and send us $25, $100, $150, $200.
[03:46:28.663 --> 03:46:36.906]  We're looking at massive, massive legal costs to fight the globalists and fight the effort to just shut us down.
[03:46:36.946 --> 03:46:37.987]  So if you love InfoWars,
[03:46:38.487 --> 03:46:40.649]  Hit that donate button.
[03:46:40.689 --> 03:46:41.089]  Exactly.
[03:46:41.129 --> 03:46:44.552]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPB and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[03:46:44.572 --> 03:46:45.753]  We have the listeners doing it.
[03:46:45.873 --> 03:46:53.939]  And we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you saying you're a Russian agent and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[03:46:53.959 --> 03:46:55.881]  We're winning is why they're targeting us.
[03:46:56.181 --> 03:46:59.263]  But people need to know this is the war for this republic.
[03:46:59.303 --> 03:46:59.904]  This is it.
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:10.123]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.747 --> 03:47:24.353]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.734 --> 03:47:27.676]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:30.177 --> 03:47:30.798]  Welcome back.
[03:47:32.543 --> 03:47:36.364]  A little talking heads there to usher us into the next segment.
[03:47:36.384 --> 03:47:38.245]  Let's go right to the phone lines.
[03:47:38.765 --> 03:47:41.006]  Joshua in Texas has been holding.
[03:47:41.446 --> 03:47:43.607]  Joshua, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:43.987 --> 03:47:45.388]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[03:47:46.688 --> 03:47:57.873]  Well, I've been hearing a lot about from Dave Hodges from the Common Central that there's more movement from Mexico, that it's not just
[03:47:59.879 --> 03:48:12.726]  Those immigrants on the convoy, it's multiple convoys that some of them are coming from El Salvador who are working with the drug cartels and terrorists trying to move terrorists through the border.
[03:48:13.947 --> 03:48:21.731]  And they're trying to do a flank to where they make it seem like people are going to California, but they're coming towards Texas.
[03:48:23.872 --> 03:48:24.972]  And there was also news of
[03:48:29.387 --> 03:48:33.118]  Military personnel talking about also convoys coming from Canada.
[03:48:35.418 --> 03:48:37.380]  Well, let me say this, Joshua.
[03:48:37.400 --> 03:48:51.191]  I haven't heard about the Canadian portion of your report, but interestingly enough, someone I spoke to this morning at the White House told me exactly what you just told me about this convoy that seems to be moving north.
[03:48:52.312 --> 03:48:55.915]  And the good news, therefore, is our president knows it.
[03:48:56.436 --> 03:48:59.658]  Therefore, the people in charge of immigration know it.
[03:49:00.439 --> 03:49:05.123]  And the good news even further is that Barack Obama is no longer president.
[03:49:05.763 --> 03:49:08.245]  So it's a legitimate concern.
[03:49:08.385 --> 03:49:12.228]  The good news is the commander-in-chief is at the helm.
[03:49:12.608 --> 03:49:15.691]  And I think he recognizes exactly what you just said.
[03:49:16.071 --> 03:49:18.073]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:49:19.073 --> 03:49:21.675]  Caitlin has called in.
[03:49:22.096 --> 03:49:27.260]  Evidently, Caitlin, like me, is an aficionado of Brain Force Plus.
[03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:29.862]  Caitlin, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:49:31.172 --> 03:49:33.493]  Hi, thanks.
[03:49:33.733 --> 03:49:37.974]  I wanted to talk a little bit about the brain force.
[03:49:38.514 --> 03:49:45.216]  I'm a holistic health coach, but about two years ago, I was in a car accident and suffered a brain injury.
[03:49:46.896 --> 03:49:53.958]  My mom also, when I was a child, had a brain cyst removed.
[03:49:54.098 --> 03:49:59.260]  We have both found such great benefit from using brain force.
[03:50:01.230 --> 03:50:22.841]  And one of the things that I did want to point out that the different natural supplements that Alex provides on InfoWars, a lot of times they're referred to as boosting, but I just want to say that actually anything that's natural is balancing.
[03:50:23.401 --> 03:50:29.024]  Because sometimes, like with the new immune wall, if you have lupus, you're
[03:50:29.785 --> 03:50:35.127]  The immune system is already hyperactive and you don't want to boost it.
[03:50:35.147 --> 03:50:36.087]  You need to calm it down.
[03:50:36.867 --> 03:50:41.949]  And the metrotrophics are very balancing.
[03:50:42.009 --> 03:50:44.810]  So if it needs to be boosted, it'll boost your system.
[03:50:44.850 --> 03:50:48.111]  And if it needs to be calmed down, the supplements will calm down your system.
[03:50:49.302 --> 03:50:51.463]  You make an excellent point, Caitlin.
[03:50:51.483 --> 03:50:53.003]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:50:53.443 --> 03:51:07.887]  First of all, when it comes to BrainForce+, you're looking at almost 6,000 satisfied testimonials from customers and a satisfaction rate, we rate this at 4.6%, 92% positive reaction to this terrific product.
[03:51:12.808 --> 03:51:28.422]  What I like about it is that at that four o'clock point in the day, when I start to have my energy slump, Brain Force Plus gives me mental clarity and energy to continue working into the evening.
[03:51:28.982 --> 03:51:41.151]  Yet when I finally throw in the towel and go to bed, some usually around midnight, I don't feel jacked up or spacey because of a product I took earlier in the evening.
[03:51:41.271 --> 03:51:54.161]  I'm able to sleep and that's without the terrific sleep product that we also have on the website, which I have used at times of high stress or extensive travel.
[03:51:54.821 --> 03:52:02.406]  So I appreciate your endorsement for what probably is my favorite product at the InfoWars store.
[03:52:02.907 --> 03:52:09.711]  And I remind our listeners again that we are totally and completely financed by listener and viewer
[03:52:10.732 --> 03:52:12.733]  Patrons at the InfoWars store.
[03:52:13.274 --> 03:52:14.975]  This is how we function.
[03:52:15.035 --> 03:52:22.180]  We don't have one big corporate sponsor that says to Alex Jones, Oh, you can cover that, but you can't cover this.
[03:52:22.280 --> 03:52:25.062]  And you can say that, but you can't say this.
[03:52:25.222 --> 03:52:28.624]  No, Alex Jones goes wherever the facts take him.
[03:52:29.224 --> 03:52:32.387]  We here at InfoWars go wherever the facts take us.
[03:52:32.907 --> 03:52:39.872]  We have no corporate censor sponsors standing in the wings telling us what we can cover and what we can't.
[03:52:40.732 --> 03:52:53.802]  That's due to the independence of InfoWars, and that independence is based on the fact that we are only beholden to literally hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers who have bought our products online.
[03:52:54.763 --> 03:52:59.727]  Now, moving back to the phone, let's go to Franklin in the District of Columbia.
[03:52:59.767 --> 03:53:02.309]  Franklin, welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:53:02.770 --> 03:53:04.031]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[03:53:05.632 --> 03:53:06.272]  Well, thank you, Roger.
[03:53:06.292 --> 03:53:07.013]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:53:08.657 --> 03:53:16.686]  My question for you is, can someone get word to the President that he needs to stop begging Mitch McConnell to do something about the fake filibuster in the Senate?
[03:53:16.787 --> 03:53:25.076]  He needs, as a co-equal branch of government, the President has standing, I would think, to sue the Senate to change the rules that are unconstitutional.
[03:53:27.711 --> 03:53:30.794]  Now that's an interesting question that you pose, Franklin.
[03:53:30.974 --> 03:53:42.385]  I would probably defer to my good friend Judge Andrew Napolitano, who I think is one of the leading constitutional and legal scholars in the country on questions like this.
[03:53:43.286 --> 03:53:46.929]  I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell you whether the President has that standing.
[03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:48.891]  But I can tell you this.
[03:53:49.592 --> 03:53:51.794]  It's time to do away with the filibuster rule.
[03:53:51.894 --> 03:53:54.056]  It's time to go to a straight majority.
[03:53:54.496 --> 03:53:57.819]  We have finally done so in the selection of some judges.
[03:53:58.260 --> 03:54:08.069]  We need to end the ability of a crazed, left-wing, libtard minority led by Chuck Schumer, the handmaiden of Google.
[03:54:08.729 --> 03:54:17.657]  And the Silicon Valley left to hamstring this president on important questions and important appointments.
[03:54:18.458 --> 03:54:30.029]  While we're at it, I want to register an objection to the holdup in the appointment of Rick Grenell as President Trump's ambassador to Germany.
[03:54:31.092 --> 03:54:38.036]  Rick Grinnell's nomination languishes in the Senate because Mitch McConnell has not pushed it forward.
[03:54:38.756 --> 03:54:40.677]  Rick Grinnell, who was the U.N.
[03:54:40.697 --> 03:54:50.122]  spokesman under President George W. Bush, was one of the most articulate and effective campaigners for candidate Donald Trump.
[03:54:50.562 --> 03:54:59.707]  He came out early for Trump and he stood his ground, serving as a voluntary defender and advocate for Donald Trump.
[03:55:00.527 --> 03:55:04.128]  The appointment of Rick Grinnell is an excellent appointment.
[03:55:04.289 --> 03:55:12.432]  It is a perfect appointment, and it's time for Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate to drive that appointment home.
[03:55:12.792 --> 03:55:15.593]  Thank you so much for your call, Franklin.
[03:55:16.789 --> 03:55:23.654]  We are in the midst of an absolute fake news deluge, folks.
[03:55:24.194 --> 03:55:41.486]  You can't go to MSNBC or CNN or New York Magazine or any of the other fake news outlets without seeing them in high dungeon over the question of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and Russian collusion.
[03:55:42.347 --> 03:55:49.453]  This is nothing but a pathetic attempt to re-inflate a failed narrative that no one cares about.
[03:55:50.194 --> 03:56:06.828]  The greatest fight in the country today is over censorship, because the 2018 elections and the 2020 elections hinge on the ability to have a free, open, vibrant, and robust alternative media based on the Internet.
[03:56:07.569 --> 03:56:17.060]  Without that, in all candor, the chances of Republican or conservative success in the next two federal elections are very, very thin.
[03:56:18.188 --> 03:56:25.653]  You see, the Democrats have figured out that they cannot win with the electorate configured as it currently is.
[03:56:26.433 --> 03:56:33.238]  So they hope to flood our electorate with illegals who they will then legalize and register to vote.
[03:56:33.778 --> 03:56:39.682]  At the same time, they censor our voices within the larger construct of the election.
[03:56:40.615 --> 03:56:48.666]  Now, it may be true that they will never have the nerve to actually censor the Commander-in-Chief himself.
[03:56:49.804 --> 03:56:50.745]  But perhaps not.
[03:56:51.345 --> 03:57:18.943]  But when they censor us, when they censor InfoWars, when they censor Alex Jones, when they censor Owen Schroeder, when they censor yours truly, they're turning down the volume on Donald Trump's supporters, which is an important piece of the Republican effort to win the House and the Senate again in 2018 and then hold on to the White House in 2020.
[03:57:20.644 --> 03:57:22.846]  The demographics are in our favor.
[03:57:23.206 --> 03:57:25.187]  The economy is in our favor.
[03:57:25.587 --> 03:57:28.189]  The direction of America is in our favor.
[03:57:28.769 --> 03:57:32.311]  The only way they can stop us is by strangling our First Amendment.
[03:57:32.731 --> 03:57:41.596]  That's why we need you to go to the InfoWars store now, send a generous contribution, or buy one of these great products to help gird us for the fight ahead.
[03:57:42.777 --> 03:57:43.597]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:57:43.737 --> 03:57:46.139]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:52.702 --> 03:57:57.425]  Well, you know, the media has lied about me since the 1960s because I'm a hunter and I'm a gun advocate.
[03:57:57.966 --> 03:58:04.350]  And more and more people are waking up and getting wiser every day, and they're realizing what this fake news thing is all about.
[03:58:04.390 --> 03:58:09.914]  That's why Donald Trump is such an important guy, because he finally put the spotlight on the fake news cockroaches.
[03:58:10.314 --> 03:58:14.597]  And people are getting smarter all the time, and there's more and more support for truth, logic, and common sense.
[03:58:14.697 --> 03:58:15.838]  We celebrate it every damn day.
[03:58:21.966 --> 03:58:25.747]  I think most of the dirtbags on the left hate me because I'm so damn happy.
[03:58:26.587 --> 03:58:29.008]  I mean, I come out here and I got all these bows and arrows.
[03:58:29.348 --> 03:58:33.869]  I literally come out here every day and I take a pink arrow with my name on it.
[03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:38.950]  And I come out here with Chimane and we shoot our bows every day.
[03:58:39.010 --> 03:58:40.590]  We go to the range a lot.
[03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:43.991]  If you don't do it, you can learn something from Ted Nugent.
[03:58:44.071 --> 03:58:44.951]  It is the following.
[03:58:46.012 --> 03:58:47.572]  Get yourself a bow and arrow.
[03:58:50.672 --> 03:58:58.440]  And when you are looking at your target, and you're preparing to draw your bow, it goes all the way back to the origins of Zen.
