[00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:09.409]  Big Brother.
[00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.471]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.093]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.974]  You want answers?
[00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:18.896]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:27.021]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.943]  I remember the year was
[00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.160]  1988.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.564]  Because I was a freshman in high school, and I remember sitting there while my dad was getting the tires rotated on his car, Saturday morning.
[00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:45.926]  Still remember it.
[00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.367]  Reading on the front page of USA Today.
[00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:53.169]  That's how good my memory is.
[00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.909]  Of past things.
[00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.670]  It's not photographic today.
[00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.171]  I've lost that ability the last 5-10 years.
[00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:21.711]  But I remember reading the article while I sat there for 30 minutes while they were rotating the tires about how scientists involved with the cell phone companies were telling folks that were about to deploy it that it shouldn't be deployed.
[00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:27.554]  And that if cell phone type systems were deployed, they should be in a box on the back of the car, the back of the truck,
[00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:39.789]  And then run up through a wire to a handheld phone because they were explaining that the amount of radiation dissipated massively out from the size of the antenna.
[00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:54.122]  And it varies the type of radiation, but I later talked to engineers about it and they confirmed that with most forms of radiation, microwave radiation, cell phone tower type stuff, UHF, VHF for TV, AM radio, all of it, it does hurt your body.
[00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.034]  An antenna will burn you, even if it's 100 watts.
[00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:02.157]  Up close, if you grab it, will burn you.
[00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:10.123]  So as you go out from the antenna, each length of the antenna, the radiation, as a rule, cuts by half.
[00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:13.766]  I'm no engineer, that's just what the engineers break down.
[00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:22.032]  So they knew back then, in 1988, that, remember the big block cell phones that you hold up to your head,
[00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:31.018]  We're giving rats in studies big, fat, juicy tumors.
[00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:41.985]  And so, I remember years later in high school telling some of the more wealthy kids I knew that had cell phones in their cars, I said, you know, you shouldn't have that under your seat.
[00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:45.548]  The transmitter, that'll give you testicular cancer.
[00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:46.849]  There were studies on that.
[00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.750]  And people are like, oh, shut up, Alex.
[00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.492]  People always thought I was showing off because I was a reader.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.881]  They're like, you're not like a bookworm, you're like a jock!
[00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.582]  Why does a jock know about stuff like this?
[00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:03.063]  It's kind of like in the movie Idiocracy, they go, what's this guy?
[00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:04.523]  A crazy person?
[00:03:04.523 --> 00:03:05.944]  What is he, a fag?
[00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:09.425]  Because he knows how to read?
[00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.105]  Look, we got one here that can read!
[00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:11.145]  So...
[00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:36.665]  When I see another article today, can cell phones cause cancer, and then you read the article, because it's always the same formula, it's CBS News, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 paragraphs later they go, absolute clear evidence, absolutely does.
[00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.447]  And it says top researchers, top scientists, you know, U.S.
[00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:42.610]  government, you name it.
[00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.091]  But they always say that.
[00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.013]  It's always just been discovered.
[00:03:49.133 --> 00:04:01.766]  So that as massive new brain tumors develop, and other tumors, they can go, oh, we just found out, sorry, we just found out cigarettes were bad in the 70s.
[00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:09.354]  They had studies 200 years ago in the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK, now UK, then England.
[00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:10.556]  They know all this stuff.
[00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:21.113]  They knew a thousand years ago that if you ground up a little bit of fluoride crystals and put it in people's drinks, it would make them calm, docile, and stupid.
[00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.275]  Hitler and Stalin put it in the water supplies in the forced labor camps.
[00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.256]  That's in Pulitzer Prize-winning books.
[00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:27.436]  Then they do it to us here.
[00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:28.857]  I go, hey, that's dangerous.
[00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:31.338]  They go, shut up, some kind of weirdo!
[00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:34.320]  You think you can read, huh?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.762]  So the reason I led the broadcast with this today is that with the 5G rollout,
[00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:44.130]  It is way beyond all of that, and we're all just killing ourselves.
[00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:53.035]  And that's why I told, even before I saw these articles this morning, I told my wife, I said, I want, I have the whole house wired, where, where it actually wired into the computers.
[00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:55.637]  Everybody keeps putting wireless in without asking me.
[00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:57.538]  And I said, we're getting all this stuff out, period.
[00:04:57.538 --> 00:04:58.139]  It's happening now.
[00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:04.166]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:11.229]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.991]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:16.732]  It's very simple.
[00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:17.672]  We went out and looked.
[00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:18.313]  What is the top?
[00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:19.233]  What is the best?
[00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:20.474]  We'll just put even more product in.
[00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:21.174]  We'll make it better.
[00:05:21.174 --> 00:05:24.876]  Leading competitors put $2 of product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:27.017]  We put $10 in it, and sell it for $30.
[00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:27.637]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:32.760]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.323]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:05:37.323 --> 00:05:41.166]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:45.028]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:48.210]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.833]  And I want people that haven't tried, brain-forced, to try it and find out why.
[00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.434]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:55.455]  It's amazing.
[00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.877]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:16.543]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.144]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday.
[00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:22.505]  Hard to believe April 2nd, 2018.
[00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:23.185]  Time is flying by.
[00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:23.766]  Let me just
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.762]  Do this here to give you an idea of how incredible the news and information is, as I'm sure most of you already know.
[00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:44.626]  They have a whole flotilla of articles out today where they say they just discovered that cell phone radiation gives you brain tumors.
[00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:54.289]  And that if you keep the phones near you and other parts of your body, even though you think they're off, they're always sending back data back and forth as part of their GPS triangulation system.
[00:06:55.626 --> 00:07:01.332]  And that they're associated with testicular cancer, brain tumors, you name it.
[00:07:01.332 --> 00:07:03.234]  Headline, can cell phones cause cancer?
[00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:11.824]  And then down here it says, they say they found clear evidence that the phone radiation caused tumors in the hearts of rats, which were some of the tumors in people.
[00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:15.448]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.971]  Also, the heart is extremely electrochemical, just like the brain.
[00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:25.033]  And that's why it's particularly bad for the heart and the brain to be associated with cell phone radiation.
[00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:30.615]  But now, the 5G is magnitude stronger.
[00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:31.895]  So we're gonna cover that today.
[00:07:31.895 --> 00:07:39.478]  Now, that's just one article in this technological dystopia we're entering.
[00:07:39.478 --> 00:07:40.578]  No more secrets!
[00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:45.740]  New mind-reading machines can translate your thoughts and display them in text instantly.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.140]  Daily Mail.
[00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:51.371]  So it's all here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.172]  DNA tests for IQ are coming, but it might not be smart to take them.
[00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:58.053]  Yeah, and then who interprets them?
[00:07:58.053 --> 00:07:59.874]  Let's continue.
[00:07:59.874 --> 00:08:01.074]  They loathe Christmas.
[00:08:01.074 --> 00:08:03.355]  Google refuses to recognize Easter.
[00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:04.995]  First Apple, now Google.
[00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:15.258]  This is a unified operation, but they recognize Muhammad, they recognize Buddhists, they recognize all these communist officials in the little doodle that's at the top of the Google homepage.
[00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:16.358]  What Google's best known for?
[00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:27.383]  Paul Watson pointed this out and James Whipp responded back saying they love Christmas, plain and simple.
[00:08:27.383 --> 00:08:37.828]  We're gonna look at that because remember the Pope came out last week and said, there is no hell in complete contravention of the Old and New Testament.
[00:08:37.828 --> 00:08:42.270]  And all the passages that say that anybody tells you there isn't a hell, they're the devil.
[00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.451]  But he also says he's nauseous.
[00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.472]  He becomes nauseous.
[00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:55.697]  Whenever he hears about Europe having Christian roots, he says, we must accept Islam.
[00:08:55.697 --> 00:08:58.759]  He is a known Marxist.
[00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.140]  He is a completely false pope.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.941]  But that's what the globalists did.
[00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:12.088]  The Rockefellers, John D. Rockefeller, funded the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, and they ran communist operatives and others for the seminary.
[00:09:12.088 --> 00:09:15.711]  And so you go to your old ornate church, and by successive approximation,
[00:09:16.687 --> 00:09:18.168]  They pull the crosses out.
[00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:20.590]  They don't talk about Christ.
[00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.113]  They take out your collection plate for the Methodist churches and it goes to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:09:26.113 --> 00:09:28.815]  And the people just sit there and they take it.
[00:09:28.815 --> 00:09:30.596]  This is how they've taken over the churches.
[00:09:30.596 --> 00:09:31.917]  They're not churches.
[00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:35.999]  They're dens of devils.
[00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.101]  Dens of devils.
[00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.403]  But then you go there and there are people seeking God, so you might even feel
[00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:48.381]  Kind of a spirit of good in the church, but also a spirit of bad, because it's a battleground.
[00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:55.863]  And you've got the big spiders, the big serpents, up there in the pulpits, praying on those seeking God.
[00:09:55.863 --> 00:10:02.905]  Of course, before you get to Christ, there'll be a priest class of serpents.
[00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:05.486]  That's what the devil is, there to get in front of you.
[00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:10.187]  That's why Christ said, get behind me, Methodist Church!
[00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:11.508]  Get behind me, Vatican!
[00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.485]  Get behind me, Satan!
[00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:17.126]  That's what it is.
[00:10:17.126 --> 00:10:22.029]  Ladies and gentlemen, pure and simple, the Pope is a devil worshipper.
[00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:30.413]  The Pope is someone on record whose aide-de-camp has been indicted and arrested for kidnapping over 100 little boys and supplying them.
[00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:37.718]  The Pope used pedophilia in the church to remove the other Pope and send him to Gandalf Castle.
[00:10:37.718 --> 00:10:38.338]  Gandalfus.
[00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:47.271]  And there is a special place in hell for people that are into this type of behavior, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:50.551]  But again, by successful approximation, open your borders!
[00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.312]  World government is good!
[00:10:52.312 --> 00:10:54.172]  We need a world government church!
[00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:56.393]  The family is bad!
[00:10:56.393 --> 00:10:57.433]  Open your borders!
[00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:58.954]  Open your borders!
[00:10:58.954 --> 00:10:59.754]  Open your borders!
[00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:17.632]  And suddenly the leftist media that hated the Catholic Church because it was conservative and it had a lot of values they didn't like, it's always had problems, obviously any big institution does, but now you can stick a fork in it and say this is the fall of the Vatican.
[00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:24.354]  See, I have just hit only two articles, three articles, and it just gets insane.
[00:11:24.354 --> 00:11:30.356]  I've got hundreds that are all just as bombshell we're going to cover today.
[00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.416]  London murder rate
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.886]  Beats New York at stabbing surges.
[00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:44.616]  Highest crime rate in the world of any industrialized nation city for stabbings and muggage.
[00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.899]  London is incredibly dangerous.
[00:11:50.433 --> 00:12:04.620]  I was just there a few years ago, got out of a restaurant about 10, trying to get a cab, out for just a few minutes, and had multiple gangs of people come over, but we were a couple big guys, and they just kind of smarted off and wandered off.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.741]  But it is something else.
[00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:18.226]  And, don't worry though, all the acid attacks, seven a day, all the rest of it, AQ Condra has to cover it up, he says it's the safest,
[00:12:19.704 --> 00:12:21.266]  That's just another one of the articles.
[00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:23.529]  Let's hear from Mr. Khan, the Islamist mayor of London.
[00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:40.829]  Well, London is the safest global city in the world and one of the safest cities in the world.
[00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:50.352]  My thoughts are with the family of Keith Palmer, the police officer who tragically lost his life yesterday, keeping our city and keeping Londoners safe.
[00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:55.213]  And one of the reasons I can say that London is the safest global city in the world and one of the safest
[00:12:55.493 --> 00:12:58.816]  That is a year ago, last March, when they had a bunch of bombings and stabbings.
[00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.878]  So it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world.
[00:13:01.878 --> 00:13:03.419]  The police cover up the crime.
[00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:10.085]  They won't respond when Islamists are kidnapping little girls or selling them into sex slavery or chopping their bodies up.
[00:13:25.217 --> 00:13:31.002]  Reselling them at the kebab shops at their favorite fronts.
[00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:34.625]  You can't make this up.
[00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:38.368]  It's the worst rate of murder and stabbing since 1800.
[00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:42.512]  Under Sadiq Khan.
[00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:45.514]  He just told you everything's fine.
[00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:50.779]  Meanwhile, the DNC chair calls for repeal of the Second Amendment.
[00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:52.080]  We've got that video.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.281]  They've also tweeted that out.
[00:13:55.543 --> 00:14:04.465]  And I've noticed that on Twitter, especially the bots come to my real Alex Jones on Twitter and say, oh, you're a kook.
[00:14:04.465 --> 00:14:05.405]  Nobody wants your guns.
[00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:07.886]  Nobody wants to repeal your second amendment.
[00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:09.666]  It's gaslighting.
[00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.267]  It's unbelievable.
[00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:18.848]  So that is just a small, small, small smattering of what we're going to be covering.
[00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:21.769]  Kim Jong-un publicly had a concert.
[00:14:22.657 --> 00:14:27.059]  For what he sends you to forced labor camp or executes you for if he catches you listening to it.
[00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.060]  South Korean pop music.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.601]  But what's good for the communist leader is not good for the general public.
[00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:40.805]  That's why we have lots of spoiled brats living in the lap of luxury calling for communism here because they think they'll be the commissars, they'll be the ones in charge.
[00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:42.946]  And that's what we're facing right now.
[00:14:42.946 --> 00:14:46.128]  It's all coming up today.
[00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:48.809]  Trump says no more DACA deal.
[00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:51.310]  Must go nuclear as refugee caravan approaches.
[00:14:52.722 --> 00:14:55.565]  Funded out of Honduras by the UN.
[00:14:55.565 --> 00:15:02.393]  Just like Soros floods Europe with the Zodiac boats coming in.
[00:15:02.393 --> 00:15:03.534]  So they're priming the pump.
[00:15:03.534 --> 00:15:06.197]  Mexico's opening its borders saying, come on through.
[00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.420]  As long as you don't stay, go El Norte.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:19.262]  We're gonna go to break and come back with all this and more, but first off, we have super high quality, wide spectrum of great body armor that is the very best, lowest prices.

[00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.411]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:33.992]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.

[00:17:06.312 --> 00:17:07.894]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:16.262]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:09.310]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:17.434]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.714 --> 00:18:18.154]  We have now
[00:18:47.534 --> 00:18:54.896]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.861]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.723]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:17.204]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:17.204 --> 00:19:24.050]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.271]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:19:26.112 --> 00:19:35.820]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:52.653]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:19:52.653 --> 00:19:55.796]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:19:55.916 --> 00:20:03.908]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarsline.com.
[00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:06.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.627 --> 00:20:38.340]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:50.049]  You know, I don't want to say I got intimidated, but in hindsight, I kind of suspended my own research
[00:20:51.656 --> 00:21:06.539]  Just because up front, I wanted to believe that the tragic mass shooting a month and a half ago in Florida was completely organic.
[00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:08.539]  I mean, we know the police stood down at the school.
[00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.020]  We know they stood down before.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.281]  We know he was in government care and on psychotropic drugs from the health department.
[00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:16.301]  It's always the same story.
[00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:20.382]  So, it was a false flag in that there was a standout.
[00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:25.346]  I mean, if you know somebody's going to do something and you don't do anything about it, that makes you an accomplice.
[00:21:25.346 --> 00:21:39.868]  So, there's a spectrum of false flags, from benign neglect, to kind of opening the door and standing down, to carrying out a mass shooting yourself and then framing a patsy who conveniently kills themselves.
[00:21:39.868 --> 00:21:42.409]  There's a spectrum of those.
[00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:45.069]  And we know governments throughout history have staged false flags.
[00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:49.090]  That's why the term false flag is in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.310]  That's why it's taught in history books.
[00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:56.534]  I repopularized the term in the last 20 years.
[00:21:56.534 --> 00:22:00.715]  And there's a lot of declassified examples of false flags.
[00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:05.297]  There's a Wikipedia page on false flags.
[00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:07.437]  That doesn't mean every event's a false flag.
[00:22:07.437 --> 00:22:12.799]  And I think people died, and I don't think David Hogg's a crisis actor from California.
[00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:20.682]  He went so far as to go check and get the yearbook from the year before, and there he is, a sophomore, a junior, now a senior.
[00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:34.927]  But the video, and I found a bunch of these this weekend, and I saw these last week, we had an article about it, headline, David Hogg caught lying about what happened at the shooting.
[00:22:34.927 --> 00:22:46.699]  And I went and watched them this weekend, not just the little clips, but the longer interviews they were part of, and so it's not a context where he says
[00:22:48.732 --> 00:22:55.274]  I was at home when the shooting happened, so I got on my bike and rode to the school to get as many interviews as I could.
[00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:59.415]  We'll play it in a moment.
[00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:13.540]  And then, he's in all these other interviews, saying, I was at the school, in the class when the shooting started, and I was with the teacher, so we heard the shots, we closed the door.
[00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:24.210]  And then other things where he talked about where he was when the shooting started, so he got in the closet, and then they conduct interviews in the closet.
[00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:32.331]  And I'm like, there's no way you're three miles away, and then you're there, there's a shooting, so you're in class when the shooting starts, you close the door.
[00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:45.995]  I mean, we had an article, I mentioned it, but I'd already been banned off YouTube, or had videos blocked, misrepresenting what I'd said when I just pointed out there was a stand down.
[00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:47.015]  The students told us that.
[00:23:48.234 --> 00:23:48.734]  So here's the deal.
[00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:49.835]  David Hogg is a public figure now.
[00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:52.277]  And he's called me cuss word names and a con artist and a fraud.
[00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:53.417]  He's in a man's world.
[00:23:53.417 --> 00:23:54.438]  I haven't done all that.
[00:24:15.046 --> 00:24:18.569]  And then it came out over the weekend, and you guys reprint me that article, thanks.
[00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:36.666]  Paul Joseph Watson found his Reddit, and it is David Hogg's Reddit, and he's there talking about how it's good that mosquitoes are killing millions of people, because we need billions to die for depopulation.
[00:24:36.666 --> 00:24:40.349]  And see, that's just the perfect globalist leftist religion.
[00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:47.170]  That's Bill and Melinda Gates, that's the UN, that's this whole program.
[00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.851]  There it is, David Hogg, Reddit post, celebrates mosquitoes killing billions of humans.
[00:24:50.851 --> 00:25:05.017]  I want to put that back up on Infowars.com, because that came out Saturday, and it went viral, but didn't get picked up by anybody else, and it's his Reddit linking back to his other accounts and him over the years.
[00:25:05.017 --> 00:25:07.698]  They kill humans, billions of them, which is great for the environment.
[00:25:10.066 --> 00:25:13.547]  That's like a Professor Pianca at UT, you know, saying similar things.
[00:25:13.547 --> 00:25:22.189]  So, oh, he wants billions gone, but 16 dead, he's the saddest person in the world.
[00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:25.790]  So, this is crazy.
[00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.772]  Hogg needs to be really looked into very, very closely, obviously.
[00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:34.453]  And people need to, I need to compile just all these interviews of him.
[00:25:37.438 --> 00:25:43.820]  Where he's saying completely different stuff on the same day.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.642]  They're in there with the blurry cell phone, saying, I'm in here, he's shooting right now.
[00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:54.784]  And he's telling you the time, but then, when it's supposed to happen, he's saying he's three miles away when it starts.
[00:25:54.784 --> 00:26:04.048]  I mean, it's not just one video, there's like dozens of these, where he's saying two different things.
[00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:04.168]  And,
[00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:07.387]  Let's go ahead and just roll some of this video.
[00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:10.589]  Go ahead and roll the one where he says he rode his bike in.
[00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:12.831]  Here it is.
[00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:27.465]  On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.
[00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:33.428]  Now let's go to the closet one and there's even more I spent hours and hours and I I'm gonna be honest with you I got tears in my eyes
[00:26:57.304 --> 00:27:06.106]  Because I started looking into Hogg even more after I saw Paul's article where he wants billions of people to die and you have to understand something.
[00:27:06.106 --> 00:27:16.889]  My head exploded with understanding and chills like I'm getting right now because you understand George Soros is one of those ten people that met at the Rockefeller Foundation meetings
[00:27:18.493 --> 00:27:23.774]  That ABC News, London Guardian reported, headlined, Billionaires Meet to Discuss Overpopulation.
[00:27:23.774 --> 00:27:31.035]  And they said, at the end of the article, we need a world government, this was like seven years ago, we need a world government to reduce population.
[00:27:31.035 --> 00:27:41.077]  And it was George Soros, David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Bill and Melinda Gates, George Soros.
[00:27:41.077 --> 00:27:43.858]  There it is, Wall Street Journal, Billionaires Try to Shrink World Population, 2009.
[00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.292]  So I guess, wow, that's already eight, nine years ago, wow.
[00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:54.337]  And you can go read it!
[00:27:54.337 --> 00:27:57.439]  Secret meeting that got leaked.
[00:27:57.439 --> 00:28:02.143]  And then Hogg is funded by George Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator.
[00:28:02.143 --> 00:28:07.408]  The Women's March is the main funder, he's the main funder of that.
[00:28:07.408 --> 00:28:09.630]  And then Hogg wants depopulation.
[00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.132]  What do you think's really going on here now, folks?
[00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:16.341]  Let's go ahead and go to Hogg.
[00:28:16.341 --> 00:28:16.662]  Here it is.
[00:28:28.577 --> 00:28:37.802]  At around 2.30 we heard a gunshot in my AP Environmental Science class, and we initially thought it was a drill.
[00:28:37.802 --> 00:28:39.763]  Just stop, I can't handle it anymore.
[00:28:39.763 --> 00:28:48.868]  Listen, he says he's... Well, you have to get the timeline, because he's saying on these videos, the timeline, this is when it's beginning in the closet.
[00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:51.870]  But when it's beginning, he's at his house and rides three miles on his bike.
[00:28:53.964 --> 00:28:58.262]  And then his story after that is, no, I was always there when it began in my class.
[00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:01.899]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:29:01.899 --> 00:29:02.980]  Get back to nature.

[00:30:00.302 --> 00:30:01.263]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:30:01.263 --> 00:30:01.823]  Good, brother.
[00:30:01.823 --> 00:30:03.785]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:30:03.785 --> 00:30:05.487]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:30:05.487 --> 00:30:09.550]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.153]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:30:12.153 --> 00:30:14.575]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:30:14.575 --> 00:30:22.542]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:22.642 --> 00:30:25.986]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:30:25.986 --> 00:30:27.528]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:30:27.528 --> 00:30:32.213]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:30:32.213 --> 00:30:37.619]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:39.640]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.940]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:07.116]  Great!
[00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.237]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:31:08.237 --> 00:31:12.759]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:22.022]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:31:22.022 --> 00:31:22.923]  Wow, thank you.
[00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:25.284]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:31:25.284 --> 00:31:27.104]  Which Nutra-Certicals do you like best?
[00:31:27.104 --> 00:31:30.566]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:31:30.566 --> 00:31:31.166]  That's amazing.
[00:31:31.206 --> 00:31:31.826]  Incredible.
[00:31:31.826 --> 00:31:34.887]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:31:34.887 --> 00:31:36.247]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:31:36.247 --> 00:31:37.908]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:31:37.908 --> 00:31:39.068]  And I love you guys.
[00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:41.308]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:48.170]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.190]  You will love it.
[00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.351]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[00:33:03.372 --> 00:33:08.015]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.015 --> 00:33:16.801]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:18.743]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:35.782 --> 00:33:37.403]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.403 --> 00:33:41.245]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:33:41.245 --> 00:33:43.367]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:33:43.367 --> 00:33:59.377]  And I want to put some bookends on what I was just getting into with the huge public figure, the anti-gun superstar, as he's called, the guy that said the establishment is shaking in its boots, that he thanked all the major corporate groups and government and others for being anti-gun.
[00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:04.464]  It is the establishment that is for victim disarmament.
[00:34:04.464 --> 00:34:09.406]  Mr. Hogg on the day of the shooting said that he was home when he learned of the shooting.
[00:34:09.406 --> 00:34:10.287]  We've already played that clip.
[00:34:10.287 --> 00:34:17.630]  And then he got on his bike and his camera and then he raced to the school to do interviews.
[00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:26.994]  Then there are interviews he gave where he said that he was at the school in a particular class when they heard what they thought was the shot.
[00:34:26.994 --> 00:34:28.435]  So he learned of the shooting there.
[00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:35.465]  Then there's other videos where he's in a closet.
[00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:41.249]  Saying that there's a shooting going on and you know it's very dramatic shot.
[00:34:41.249 --> 00:34:46.752]  Like saving Private Ryan style with a shaky camera.
[00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:47.633]  Now I want to be clear.
[00:34:47.633 --> 00:34:49.134]  I believe the shootings happened.
[00:34:49.134 --> 00:34:50.675]  I believe mass shootings are a terrible thing.
[00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:55.979]  I don't blame gun owners for them.
[00:34:55.979 --> 00:34:58.761]  The media has misrepresented day one.
[00:34:59.815 --> 00:35:03.278]  Somebody else's video said they thought he was a crisis actor.
[00:35:03.278 --> 00:35:05.179]  They removed that video, which I don't think they should do.
[00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:07.802]  People have their free speech right.
[00:35:07.802 --> 00:35:17.349]  And then they attributed it to me and then took a bunch of our videos down and tried to set a precedent to ban everybody's speech as massive censorship intensifies.
[00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:24.815]  If it wasn't for DrudgeReport.com and all of you making a big deal out of this, Google would not have restored our channel and removed the strikes.
[00:35:24.815 --> 00:35:25.496]  The false strikes.
[00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:35.906]  Which again, even the Wall Street Journal admitted was part of a precedent to first take info wars, WikiLeaks, off the internet, then it'd be everybody else.
[00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:44.113]  It's exactly what Matt Drudge was warned of two and a half years ago by a conservative Chief Justice, the one that's still living.
[00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:52.660]  So, I've really thought about this, and I've thought about it long and hard.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.881]  Why would David Hogg
[00:35:57.102 --> 00:36:09.849]  Have a camera while the mass shooting is going on in a closet, but then he's at home and has to get a camera to come cover it.
[00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:21.815]  Because you see, people could argue that, well, he was at the school and he left three miles, I guess, to get a camera and then came back three miles.
[00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:23.917]  That's not what he said.
[00:36:23.917 --> 00:36:25.457]  And then by then the shooting would be over.
[00:36:25.457 --> 00:36:26.358]  He wouldn't be in a closet.
[00:36:28.564 --> 00:36:44.454]  So there's no way that he either made up some of the stories, didn't think it was dramatic enough that he wasn't at the school when it happened, he got there after, he kind of recreated some of it.
[00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:49.317]  A lot of journalists have been caught doing that before.
[00:36:49.317 --> 00:36:54.080]  Or he really was at the school during the shooting and for some reason just said he was at home and he's lying about that.
[00:36:55.563 --> 00:37:05.089]  I mean, you can't look at this as a police investigator or a journalist or anybody and say, wow, there's nothing going on here.
[00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:14.474]  We'll post this video from this live show in the next few hours, InfoWars.com, and try to look at the comments, because a lot of times you'll have angles that I didn't think of.
[00:37:14.474 --> 00:37:16.475]  But I'm just trying to figure this out.
[00:37:16.475 --> 00:37:17.436]  One way or another,
[00:37:20.683 --> 00:37:21.744]  Maybe from the stress.
[00:37:21.744 --> 00:37:23.564]  He completely blacked out.
[00:37:23.564 --> 00:37:24.385]  That's happened before.
[00:37:24.385 --> 00:37:25.846]  PTSD.
[00:37:25.846 --> 00:37:36.331]  And just had amnesia when he was at the school and shot these videos at the shooters right outside and we're waiting for the police and all this.
[00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:38.012]  And he had amnesia.
[00:37:38.012 --> 00:37:43.454]  And then he went home and then had amnesia and then went back once he didn't have amnesia.
[00:37:43.454 --> 00:37:45.375]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:47.216]  I'm trying to believe David Hogg.
[00:37:47.216 --> 00:37:48.417]  And maybe when he wrote about
[00:37:50.874 --> 00:37:58.255]  Good thing that billions of people die from mosquitoes, because we need to depopulate the Earth.
[00:37:58.255 --> 00:38:01.736]  Maybe he has multiple personalities, and that was the bad personality.
[00:38:01.736 --> 00:38:04.016]  Maybe there's a good personality.
[00:38:04.016 --> 00:38:12.358]  A sweet person that does care about 16 dead young people.
[00:38:12.358 --> 00:38:17.959]  I mean, I'm just tongue-in-cheek here at this point, trying to come up with some theories here.
[00:38:19.482 --> 00:38:22.544]  But you notice the media is dead silent.
[00:38:22.544 --> 00:38:24.565]  Infowars.com.
[00:38:24.565 --> 00:38:29.228]  Hundreds of thousands of people read Paul Watson's article.
[00:38:29.228 --> 00:38:32.710]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands watched the videos I put out.
[00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.873]  I checked it on Sunday and the view counts on the three different videos we put out on it were about 400,000.
[00:38:37.873 --> 00:38:42.896]  So 400,000 people watched videos about Paul Watson's article.
[00:38:42.896 --> 00:38:49.040]  I know hundreds of thousands read it because I asked Paul.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.160]  And
[00:38:52.782 --> 00:38:59.948]  There is no coverage of it, there is no discussion, there is no debate, there is no nothing.
[00:38:59.948 --> 00:39:13.920]  I mean, if we were wrong about this being his Reddit handle, or if it's a good thing to want to see billions die, then we should hear from Mr. Hogg about it.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.342]  Mosquitoes, they kill billions.
[00:39:16.764 --> 00:39:19.065]  of them, which is great for the environment.
[00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:22.407]  They kill humans, billions of them, which is great for the environment.
[00:39:22.407 --> 00:39:26.729]  Well, is 16 dead fellow students good for the environment?
[00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:35.313]  If you're like Bill Maher, that's a liberal, political, religious sacrament, is abortion, depopulation, not caring about other people, Bill Maher.
[00:39:35.313 --> 00:39:40.756]  I say kill people, euthanize them, make them commit suicide, whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:39:47.478 --> 00:39:53.583]  And so I'm just sitting here dealing with this and asking questions of anomalies.
[00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:56.845]  I was criticized as a liar three days into it because we had students on.
[00:39:56.845 --> 00:39:59.167]  The media said Jones Media Matters.
[00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:03.250]  George Soros came out and said, Jones claims the police stood down.
[00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.592]  Jones claims the deputies didn't go in.
[00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:10.936]  No, the students we had on and that matched up with local news feeds.
[00:40:11.596 --> 00:40:24.923]  You know, local eyewitness news feeds, all saying the same thing, and then we get a couple students on, and other students contact us, they're scared to come on, and they say, yeah, there were a bunch of sheriff's deputies there during the shooting, and they didn't go in, and there were multiple shooters.
[00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:26.724]  They didn't want that discussed.
[00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.765]  I wasn't saying there were multiple shooters.
[00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:32.327]  I said the witnesses were all saying it.
[00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:40.832]  Some of them were with Nick Cruz while the shooting's still going on, and YouTube took that video down, because they didn't want that going viral, did they?
[00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:44.967]  Then Hogg challenges me to a debate.
[00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:48.149]  Then Hogg backs out.
[00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:53.292]  Laura Ingram, Hogg is saying, man, four colleges I've applied to, none of them want me.
[00:40:53.292 --> 00:40:53.952]  What's going on?
[00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:59.635]  I don't know how you're getting your grades when you haven't even been back to school in a month and a half.
[00:40:59.635 --> 00:41:03.417]  You say you don't need to be in your classes and you're a senior.
[00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:08.420]  And if you're a university and you see somebody that they know is going to end up taking that school over with the media,
[00:41:09.825 --> 00:41:25.409]  And they know that at Evergreen and at all these other colleges from Missouri to Oregon, they have 20 to 30 percent enrollment drops in one year when SJWs have stunts.
[00:41:32.438 --> 00:41:36.461]  So the globalists are trying to stop us sharing information, stop us communicating.
[00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:39.804]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they're all censoring more than ever.
[00:41:39.804 --> 00:41:41.825]  Google.
[00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.567]  That's what we've got to talk people word of mouth.
[00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.748]  We've got to call in to talk radio.
[00:41:45.748 --> 00:41:46.869]  We've got to call in to C-SPAN.
[00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:48.370]  You've got to start a local radio show.
[00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.693]  Start an AXS TV show.
[00:41:51.693 --> 00:41:59.219]  Put up a little FM transmitter that just goes a mile in your neighborhood in an open space and hand out flyers.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.043]  And do your own community broadcast.
[00:42:02.043 --> 00:42:06.173]  Whatever you do, we're an information war, and we're winning.
[00:42:06.173 --> 00:42:07.556]  But the globalists are pushing back.
[00:42:07.556 --> 00:42:07.836]  Trump!
[00:42:10.256 --> 00:42:15.482]  Has a 50% approval rating even though Rasmussen samples more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:42:15.482 --> 00:42:21.529]  Trump's really at 60-65% just like I told you for the election of voters, likely voters.
[00:42:21.529 --> 00:42:23.251]  The globalists are in panic mode.
[00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:25.253]  We are culturally winning.
[00:42:25.253 --> 00:42:26.834]  They are bullying everybody.
[00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:30.999]  The universities are weaponized political operations.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:43.487]  Pushing a criminal agenda of anti-free speech, anti-self-defense, anti-free market that are deploying into all the major bureaucracies and systems to try to shut everyone up.
[00:42:43.487 --> 00:42:48.130]  The answer to that, the answer to censorship is action and speech.
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:53.614]  The answer to this is resistance and getting energized and aggressive.
[00:42:53.614 --> 00:42:54.955]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.955 --> 00:42:56.516]  InfoWars.com.
[00:42:56.516 --> 00:42:57.997]  NewsWars.com.
[00:42:57.997 --> 00:42:58.377]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.397 --> 00:43:03.140]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:10.204]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:43:10.204 --> 00:43:14.948]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:43:14.948 --> 00:43:15.708]  It's very simple.
[00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:16.649]  We went out and looked.
[00:43:16.649 --> 00:43:17.289]  What is the top?
[00:43:17.289 --> 00:43:18.210]  What is the best?
[00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.451]  We'll just put even more product in.
[00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:20.151]  We'll make it better.
[00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:23.834]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.995]  We put $10 in it, and sell it for $30.
[00:43:25.995 --> 00:43:26.596]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:43:28.797 --> 00:43:31.839]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:36.282]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:43:36.282 --> 00:43:40.125]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:44.007]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:43:44.007 --> 00:43:47.169]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:43:47.169 --> 00:43:50.812]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:53.413]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:54.414]  It's amazing.

[00:43:59.317 --> 00:44:04.900]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.761]  It'd take hours.
[00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:08.202]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.202 --> 00:44:09.382]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.382 --> 00:44:11.003]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:14.225]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:14.225 --> 00:44:15.345]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:18.507]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.507 --> 00:44:22.289]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:25.391]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:26.291]  So you can upload it.
[00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:27.732]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[00:44:28.192 --> 00:44:30.933]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:45:01.121 --> 00:45:06.624]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:07.464]  I take this.
[00:45:07.464 --> 00:45:08.585]  My family takes this.
[00:45:08.585 --> 00:45:12.867]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:45:12.867 --> 00:45:17.109]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:45:17.469 --> 00:45:22.111]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:23.232]  I don't feel good.
[00:45:23.232 --> 00:45:26.993]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:45:26.993 --> 00:45:29.694]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:35.497]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:45:35.497 --> 00:45:38.458]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:45:38.458 --> 00:45:41.980]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.221]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:44.581]  I love it.
[00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.543]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:45:47.543 --> 00:45:48.544]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:48.544 --> 00:45:54.509]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:54.509 --> 00:45:56.391]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:45:56.391 --> 00:45:58.413]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.921]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:13.385]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[00:46:13.385 --> 00:46:14.185]  Scalability.
[00:46:14.185 --> 00:46:16.606]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:46:16.606 --> 00:46:18.167]  There's a lot of product and a lot
[00:46:22.208 --> 00:46:23.429]  of ingredient MycoZX.
[00:46:23.429 --> 00:46:24.890]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:34.699]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because you have toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[00:46:34.699 --> 00:46:43.567]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:49.552]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:46:49.992 --> 00:46:52.794]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:46:52.794 --> 00:47:03.400]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.002]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:24.502]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:24.502 --> 00:47:30.323]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.323 --> 00:47:33.204]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:33.204 --> 00:47:36.345]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.345 --> 00:47:42.527]  Just putting a final statement on what I've been saying today about David Hogg.
[00:47:44.448 --> 00:48:06.595]  The fact that he was untouchable from day one, the fact that instantly those four students hit the ground, Democratic Party funded, the fact that they tried to deny that even existed, the fact that Soros is involved in it, and now Hogg is in Reddit statements wanting to depopulate the earth and thank God mosquitoes killed billions of people, is next level.
[00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:10.576]  And I've got a stack of articles here where
[00:48:12.882 --> 00:48:14.343]  Are you pro-Putin?
[00:48:14.343 --> 00:48:15.503]  Do you hold secret meetings?
[00:48:15.503 --> 00:48:22.066]  New York sanitary inspector grills Russian pancake chain.
[00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:24.787]  Came in, screamed at him, yelled at him.
[00:48:24.787 --> 00:48:26.567]  Said, I know you work for Putin.
[00:48:26.567 --> 00:48:28.068]  Is there secret meetings in the basement?
[00:48:31.294 --> 00:48:41.241]  Trying to find code violations, and the owner said the inspection affected his company's revenues, and he wondered if McDonald's was being asked similar questions by Russian officials.
[00:48:41.241 --> 00:48:42.562]  This is the hysteria, folks.
[00:48:42.562 --> 00:48:44.624]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:44.624 --> 00:48:54.571]  Imagine you're walking down the street in Austin, Texas, or Seattle, Washington, and people run over and go, in front of their kids, F you Russian spy.
[00:48:54.571 --> 00:48:55.772]  And you're sitting there looking at them.
[00:48:57.182 --> 00:48:58.943]  You're total Americana.
[00:48:58.943 --> 00:49:01.243]  You're kicking the globalists out, making the country great.
[00:49:01.243 --> 00:49:04.104]  Trump just cut off much of Russia's energy sales.
[00:49:04.104 --> 00:49:10.646]  He's absolutely dominating Russia, kicking them upside the head for no reason.
[00:49:10.646 --> 00:49:16.728]  And these morons sit there when Hillary was up to her eyeballs with the Russians, shaking her finger at us saying we're Russian spies.
[00:49:16.728 --> 00:49:19.289]  And meanwhile, other fake news.
[00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.950]  Washington Post, Jeff Bezos' weaponized system and Newsweek.
[00:49:23.601 --> 00:49:27.468]  Russian bots are tweeting their support for embattled Fox News host Laura Ingraham.
[00:49:27.468 --> 00:49:32.016]  They just call, you know, these fake accounts that the Democrats own 98% of on record.
[00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.430]  Literally.
[00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.831]  Almost all of, you know, Michelle Obama's followers are fake bots.
[00:49:37.831 --> 00:49:41.192]  But they claim, oh, we found a bot that's based in Russia.
[00:49:41.192 --> 00:49:52.275]  If anybody says anything on Facebook with an IP address connected to Russia, which is easy to fake, by the way, oh my God, Russian bots are tweeting their support for embattled Fox News host Lauren Ingram, who David Hogg once fired.
[00:49:52.275 --> 00:49:57.156]  He wants her off air because he loves the First Amendment, too.
[00:49:57.156 --> 00:49:58.556]  Incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:00.317]  That is the next level of all of this.
[00:50:02.045 --> 00:50:06.409]  Now, coming up, more big studies.
[00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:08.010]  In fact, you were putting some of the other ones up.
[00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.912]  I just have the CBS.
[00:50:09.912 --> 00:50:11.854]  Print me just the latest cell phones cancer.
[00:50:11.854 --> 00:50:12.915]  Click news.
[00:50:12.915 --> 00:50:13.435]  Print me those.
[00:50:13.435 --> 00:50:16.017]  I want to just show people how they're all written the same.
[00:50:16.017 --> 00:50:20.882]  They just discovered it guaranteed gives you brain cancer and heart cancer and all this other stuff.
[00:50:20.882 --> 00:50:22.223]  They just discovered it yesterday.
[00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:35.402]  No, they knew in the 80s, and I'm gonna have my researchers go to the microfiche, so I'm gonna read the articles in the late 80s and early 90s, and I'm gonna pull and show you how it's all the same.
[00:50:35.402 --> 00:50:45.350]  They always, oh we just learned, oh we just learned, but it's not that bad, and then now the 5G is way stronger than the others, it's out of control.
[00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:52.756]  So we're gonna break it all down coming up, but first I wanted to tie it into a very powerful report by Leanne McAdoo,
[00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:58.493]  Well yeah, if you're predisposed, if you smoke three packs of cigarettes to lung cancer, you'll get it.
[00:50:58.493 --> 00:51:05.297]  Some people can smoke and not get it, but it isn't your genetics that's giving you the cancer, it's that you're smoking the cigarettes and then your body can't take it.
[00:51:05.297 --> 00:51:08.899]  It's like some people can drink more and not have their liver fail, others can't.
[00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:12.341]  Yeah, genetically you're predisposed, if you're a Native American, to not be able to drink as much.
[00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:13.481]  It's just genetic.
[00:51:13.481 --> 00:51:20.084]  If you're a European, where the whole dark age is, they survived off fermenting everything during the summer and living off alcohol in the winter.
[00:51:20.084 --> 00:51:22.446]  The main diet was alcohol, even for children.
[00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.007]  Everybody died that couldn't handle it.
[00:51:25.007 --> 00:51:29.528]  Livers were passed on that were meaner than hell.
[00:51:29.528 --> 00:51:33.769]  That's why Europeans worldwide are known to be the people that can drink the most.
[00:51:33.769 --> 00:51:35.990]  Right through to Russia.
[00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.191]  Because if you didn't have a good liver, you'd die by the time you're about 10 years old.
[00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:43.832]  And genetically, it passed on livers that could operate that way.
[00:51:43.832 --> 00:51:44.192]  Okay?
[00:51:44.192 --> 00:51:46.633]  So, that's what this is all about, folks.
[00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:51.255]  So as all the diseases massively increase, they keep saying, oh, oh, you have bad genetics, you have bad genetics.
[00:51:51.255 --> 00:51:52.516]  No, it's what's in the environment.
[00:51:52.516 --> 00:51:56.438]  Here's Leanne's report on Alzheimer's exploding off the charts and what's behind it.
[00:51:57.185 --> 00:52:03.927]  I came across some really interesting information that I think is going to be urgent for anyone out there who's been affected by Alzheimer's.
[00:52:03.927 --> 00:52:09.569]  Practically every one of us knows at least one person whose life has been affected by this disease.
[00:52:09.569 --> 00:52:14.811]  If it runs in your family, you just prepare yourself that it could happen to you or someone that you love.
[00:52:15.311 --> 00:52:21.696]  By 2050, we're on track to have 15 million Alzheimer's patients in the United States alone.
[00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:31.182]  Those numbers are staggering and it's why most Americans just accept Alzheimer's as an inevitable way of life due to aging or bad genes.
[00:52:31.182 --> 00:52:38.888]  But in reality, less than 1% of the population develops this disease due to a genetic mutation in their DNA.
[00:52:39.528 --> 00:52:51.782]  Now we're learning that much like with cancer or heart disease or diabetes or other conditions, it's not due to genetics, but the risk is related to lifestyle and behavioral factors.
[00:52:51.782 --> 00:52:58.250]  And that's really important because it means that we have the power to take actions right now to change the outcome.
[00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:09.894]  In a recently released large-scale study, researchers found that a 10% increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods led to a 12% increase in overall cancer events.
[00:53:09.894 --> 00:53:11.475]  Now, the study isn't that shocking.
[00:53:11.475 --> 00:53:21.799]  Mostly as a nation, we've become pretty cognizant of how ultra-processed foods and partially hydrogenated oils are having a really detrimental effect on our overall health.
[00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:40.912]  But this study did really catch the eye of Dr. Lisa Moscone and others at the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medical because the BMJ study, their findings really lined up so closely with research in their field that linked diet and risk of Alzheimer's.
[00:53:40.912 --> 00:53:51.540]  This new BMJ study underscored their research showing how important lifestyle changes could be to delaying or possibly avoiding altogether the onset of this disease.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:54:01.106]  Dr. Moscone says the consensus among scientists is that over one-third of all Alzheimer's cases could be prevented by improving our lifestyle.
[00:54:01.106 --> 00:54:08.770]  This includes cardiovascular fitness, keeping our brains intellectually stimulated, and perhaps most of all, eating better.
[00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:19.817]  And for Dr. Moscone and others at the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic, eating better means addressing the ultra-processed foods that can make up half of the American diet in most cases.
[00:54:20.197 --> 00:54:30.449]  Ultra processed foods include mass-produced packaged foods as well as foods containing manufactured substances like hydrogenated oils also known as trans fats.
[00:54:30.449 --> 00:54:38.959]  So this means commercial breads and buns and biscuits and crackers, packaged snacks, industrialized confectionery and desserts like
[00:54:39.219 --> 00:54:55.265]  Icing that you put on your children's cakes and cupcakes, sodas and sweetened drinks, meat products like cold cuts and chicken nuggets, instant noodles and soups, frozen or shelf-stable ready meals, margarine, processed cheese, and most creamers.
[00:54:55.265 --> 00:55:07.450]  These are the foods whose consumption triggered an increase of cancer rates in the BMJ study, and according to Dr. Moscone, consuming these foods also increases your risk for cognitive decline and dementia.
[00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.111]  And also when you're looking at the label, you really want to pay attention to the ingredients.
[00:55:12.111 --> 00:55:21.575]  The label might say zero trans fats per serving, but if you look closer, you're likely to find partially hydrogenated oils in the top five ingredients.
[00:55:21.575 --> 00:55:26.056]  Partially hydrogenated oils have been widely used as ingredients since the 1950s.
[00:55:27.597 --> 00:55:31.518]  To increase shelf life and flavor stability of processed foods.
[00:55:31.518 --> 00:55:40.922]  Now think about it, at that exact same time, we've seen a dramatic increase in new cancer cases, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.
[00:55:40.922 --> 00:55:41.942]  So here's a tip.
[00:55:41.942 --> 00:55:50.305]  If your food can last in your pantry for weeks and weeks without going stale, it's likely that trans fats are keeping them fresh.
[00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:51.546]  Again, by 2050, 15 million people will
[00:55:55.427 --> 00:55:58.510]  or will not be diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
[00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:03.214]  In other words, Alzheimer's is not some disease that just flips on like a switch.
[00:56:03.214 --> 00:56:10.200]  Those people who are going to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2050 are starting to develop the disease right now.
[00:56:14.235 --> 00:56:26.353]  And again, Alzheimer's is just a catch-all name for older people with neurological disorders and normally brain inflammation that top neuroscientists, top brain surgeons like Blaylock on that wrote the book on it.
[00:56:26.353 --> 00:56:27.835]  And when I say literally, literally.
[00:56:28.914 --> 00:56:34.658]  All of his terms now are the mainline science of it, and now you're getting people with Alzheimer's at age 25, 30.
[00:56:34.658 --> 00:56:43.784]  So, again, it's the flicker rates, it's the television, it's the screens, it's the chemicals, it's the sedentary lifestyle, all of it fusing together.
[00:56:43.784 --> 00:56:47.186]  But the key is electromagnetic.
[00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:54.271]  You see, cell phones oscillate at the exact frequency to cut DNA up into pieces.
[00:56:54.271 --> 00:56:55.191]  It vibrates.
[00:56:55.191 --> 00:56:55.612]  Look it up.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.502]  So it causes massive DNA damage.
[00:56:59.502 --> 00:57:01.704]  And so it's just frying brains.
[00:57:01.704 --> 00:57:04.185]  And again, the heart is also very electrochemical.
[00:57:04.185 --> 00:57:07.688]  It's got all these key nerves in it as well that operate.
[00:57:07.688 --> 00:57:10.990]  They get destabilized and they start to mutate.
[00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:18.235]  And that's why it's associated in the big studies that are in CBS News with heart attacks and with heart cancer.
[00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:20.956]  Heart cancer used to be extremely rare.
[00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:22.778]  Heart cancer.
[00:57:22.778 --> 00:57:25.740]  Heart cancer is exploding because the cell phones are
[00:57:26.854 --> 00:57:28.195]  Destabilizing them.
[00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:30.717]  Hey, they tell you turn your cell phones off on an airplane.
[00:57:30.717 --> 00:57:32.338]  It can mess up the avionics.
[00:57:32.338 --> 00:57:34.679]  What do you think it's doing to you?
[00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:35.940]  And we all got the things.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.781]  All I'm saying is we got to wake up.
[00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:39.322]  We got to do something about this.
[00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:43.845]  My God, there are studies that cell phones kill more people than cigarettes.
[00:57:43.845 --> 00:57:45.407]  We'll be right back with the next hour.
[00:57:45.407 --> 00:57:45.847]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:55.922]  Infowars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[00:57:55.922 --> 00:58:04.312]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:58:04.312 --> 00:58:09.018]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:58:09.378 --> 00:58:13.121]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[00:58:13.121 --> 00:58:15.943]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[00:58:15.943 --> 00:58:24.390]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.191]  Rainforest takes about 30 minutes.
[00:58:26.191 --> 00:58:27.692]  But the two go together.
[00:58:27.692 --> 00:58:29.734]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[00:58:29.734 --> 00:58:38.661]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[00:58:39.201 --> 00:58:44.388]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[00:58:44.388 --> 00:58:48.734]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:55.661]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:58.523]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:58:58.523 --> 00:59:00.505]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:59:00.505 --> 00:59:05.529]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:07.631]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:08.912]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:14.037]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:14.037 --> 00:59:17.400]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.902]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:20.902 --> 00:59:27.586]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:27.586 --> 00:59:34.490]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:42.015]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[00:59:42.015 --> 00:59:44.877]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[00:59:45.137 --> 00:59:46.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:59:58.937 --> 01:00:00.198]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:01.018]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:01.799]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:02.419]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.419 --> 01:00:05.600]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:15.084]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:00:15.084 --> 01:00:16.805]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:26.923]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.586]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[01:00:29.586 --> 01:00:32.570]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.952]  It just pancaked.
[01:00:33.952 --> 01:00:38.198]  He took the baby's own incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[01:00:39.399 --> 01:00:41.421]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:48.428]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:48.628]  U.S.A.
[01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:50.730]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.313]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[01:00:53.313 --> 01:00:55.715]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[01:00:55.715 --> 01:00:56.816]  Some former U.S.
[01:00:56.816 --> 01:00:59.599]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:03.182]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:01:03.422 --> 01:01:09.064]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:01:09.064 --> 01:01:10.585]  Russian scum!
[01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:12.926]  Denied everything and called it all fake news.
[01:01:12.926 --> 01:01:15.867]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:01:15.867 --> 01:01:18.048]  This is a national emergency.
[01:01:18.048 --> 01:01:23.570]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.591]  This is a FEMA high level emergency.
[01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.148]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:01:29.148 --> 01:01:34.872]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange in which case?
[01:01:34.872 --> 01:01:37.714]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:01:37.714 --> 01:01:40.656]  If they can shut us down, you're next!
[01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:45.299]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:47.060]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:01:49.048 --> 01:02:06.971]  When President Trump signed the 2,232-page left-right corporatic 1.6 trillion omnibus last week that barely anyone read or was able to read, Trump, along with many American voters affected by the rampant flow of drugs and illegal immigration, had hoped
[01:02:06.971 --> 01:02:09.592]  They hoped for more funding for the border wall.
[01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:15.654]  Instead, the budget included a measly $1.6 billion of the needed $25 billion.
[01:02:15.654 --> 01:02:20.496]  And as Rand Paul tweeted, plenty of funds went to wasteful spending.
[01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:23.257]  $6 billion to the National Science Foundation alone.
[01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:27.238]  $9 billion for the GSA that oversees federal properties.
[01:02:27.238 --> 01:02:31.739]  The federal government spent $1.7 billion a year to maintain 770,000 empty buildings while continuing to buy new properties.
[01:02:36.801 --> 01:02:48.230]  $218 million for promoting democracy development in Europe, $25 million for international religious freedom, and another $10 million for disadvantaged Egyptian students.
[01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:53.053]  Even the $1.6 billion allocated for the wall won't even get the ball rolling.
[01:02:53.053 --> 01:02:59.698]  According to Homeland Security today, $641 million will go toward fencing on the southern border.
[01:02:59.858 --> 01:03:07.747]  While $960 million will be allocated to border surveillance technology and repairing existing infrastructure.
[01:03:07.747 --> 01:03:12.954]  And now President Trump is on the warpath calling out the sanctuary city madness.
[01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:23.643]  Sanctuary cities release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into our communities, including drug traffickers, drug dealers, and vicious gang members.
[01:03:23.643 --> 01:03:32.350]  In fact, several of the criminal aliens who got away in Oakland after the mayor helped them evade capture have already committed new crimes.
[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:39.455]  Crimes that could have been easily prevented if not for Oakland's dangerous sanctuary policies.
[01:03:40.255 --> 01:03:47.258]  It is no coincidence that six of the biggest heroin markets in the United States are sanctuary cities.
[01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:55.842]  More than 40% of heroin coming across the southern border is transported through California, a sanctuary state.
[01:03:55.842 --> 01:04:00.104]  Drug cartels have transformed sanctuary cities like Denver.
[01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:14.360]  Los Angeles, Chicago and New York into major distribution centers because the criminal aliens and the drug trade know that local politicians will help them evade authorities.
[01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:21.304]  Sanctuary cities put innocent Americans at the mercy of hardened criminals and heartless drug dealers.
[01:04:21.304 --> 01:04:23.125]  These are bad people.
[01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:28.447]  We want our cities to be safe havens for Americans, not criminal aliens.
[01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:37.412]  It is time for Congress to cut off funds for sanctuary cities and to close the loopholes that allow drugs and criminals to violate our borders.
[01:04:40.533 --> 01:04:42.696]  It's Dems fuel caravan invasion of the U.S.
[01:04:42.696 --> 01:04:43.216]  open borders.
[01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:47.381]  I'm going to cover this and a lot more on the other side.
[01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:48.542]  I've cleared the deck of guests.
[01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:50.484]  We're going to open the phones up as well.
[01:04:50.484 --> 01:04:54.088]  And then Matt Bracken will host the fourth hour with critical information.
[01:04:54.088 --> 01:04:54.589]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.431 --> 01:05:00.032]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:05:00.032 --> 01:05:02.613]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[01:05:02.613 --> 01:05:10.096]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:20.420]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:28.582]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mill Vitality, and so many others.
[01:05:28.582 --> 01:05:38.784]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:05:38.784 --> 01:05:40.825]  And this part is most important.
[01:05:40.825 --> 01:05:47.306]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:05:47.646 --> 01:05:49.087]  That means it's clean.
[01:05:49.087 --> 01:05:50.208]  That means it's pure.
[01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:53.109]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:55.911]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:57.532]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:06:16.784 --> 01:06:23.106]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:23.106 --> 01:06:25.466]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.466 --> 01:06:29.427]  I just want to say something at the kickoff of this hour.
[01:06:29.427 --> 01:06:37.629]  Evil knows that good is on the rise and evil is throwing everything it's got at humanity right now.
[01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:45.598]  I am seeing, in government, in media, but even locally, and even personally, the best and worst in people.
[01:06:45.598 --> 01:06:57.484]  And that's what they say historically happens at one of these quickening times, when humanity makes big, collective, spiritual decisions.
[01:06:57.484 --> 01:07:07.089]  And the world is going into... all I can call it is the end times.
[01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:13.553]  There's always these preachers that say, I know the date and it's going to happen.
[01:07:13.553 --> 01:07:16.655]  And what they're picking up is kind of the foreshadowing of what's coming.
[01:07:16.655 --> 01:07:19.737]  And the media hypes it up and the world doesn't end on a certain date.
[01:07:19.737 --> 01:07:23.979]  And I don't think the world's going to end the way a lot of people interpret the Bible.
[01:07:23.979 --> 01:07:28.742]  If you actually study it deeper, it means the end of an age.
[01:07:28.742 --> 01:07:34.606]  It means the end of a system and a whole new system coming into play.
[01:07:36.817 --> 01:07:49.165]  The Bible talks about a thousand year reign after the devil's chained up, but in modern liberal cosmology, everybody says the Christians say the end of the world's coming.
[01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:56.790]  No, the Christians say there's going to be a one world government that makes everybody have one religion, and that they're going to persecute Christians.
[01:07:57.833 --> 01:08:10.317]  And that they're going to make people have a digital mark on their hand and forehead where they're scanned to buy and sell, and that families will be broken up, and that children will be put in charge of parents.
[01:08:10.317 --> 01:08:21.040]  I mean, you read Daniel or Revelations, it's all right, it's like you're reading it and you're like, this is exactly what's happening.
[01:08:22.489 --> 01:08:45.137]  And it says that they worship the beast, the image of the beast, and it's described as like 40 feet tall, and it's in all the public places, and it speaks, and it can look whatever it wants to look like, and then it communicates to everyone in the world, and everyone marvels at the beast.
[01:08:45.137 --> 01:08:50.099]  And then you've got the false prophet, who tells you to follow the devil.
[01:08:53.957 --> 01:09:03.226]  And again, if you actually study the Bible, I don't even look at these theologians, I actually read it myself, and it makes perfect sense to everything we're looking at today.
[01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:16.879]  You have the false prophet, who tells Christians to go along with it, and you've got the beast that's the system and the AI that's everywhere and watching everyone and controlling everyone, that's the AI, and then you've got
[01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:22.375]  The Antichrist, who is the son of the devil world leader.
[01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.997]  Man, unbelievable.
[01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:25.218]  There it is.
[01:09:25.218 --> 01:09:34.509]  You've got the Pope saying there is no hell, he's sick of Christianity, open your borders, world government's good, one world religion.
[01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.271]  That is word for word.
[01:09:37.168 --> 01:09:38.688]  Revelation.
[01:09:38.688 --> 01:09:46.251]  And then you've got the beast worldwide television and AI and holograms coming in where you can have the beast and the supercomputer.
[01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.411]  Everyone's going to worship the beast.
[01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:50.832]  They don't just worship the devil.
[01:09:50.832 --> 01:09:52.113]  They don't just worship Antichrist.
[01:09:52.113 --> 01:09:59.455]  They worship Antichrist and the beast and the false prophet and the whore it rides in on.
[01:09:59.455 --> 01:10:04.316]  What is the whore?
[01:10:04.316 --> 01:10:06.117]  It's all the people that sold out to it.
[01:10:09.656 --> 01:10:16.606]  You've got the apostate evil Christian religion that's been taken over.
[01:10:16.606 --> 01:10:22.214]  You've got the worldwide beast system AI world government bureaucracy.
[01:10:22.214 --> 01:10:25.819]  You've got the devil ruling over it and you've got the whore.
[01:10:28.092 --> 01:10:36.541]  Is the whole governmental, political, sell-out system of everybody that's going to want to have that perfect five-star rating with The Beast.
[01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:37.822]  Where they'll be the cool group.
[01:10:37.822 --> 01:10:38.983]  They'll be the in-group.
[01:10:38.983 --> 01:10:40.164]  They'll walk the red carpets.
[01:10:40.164 --> 01:10:47.191]  Everything for them will be taken care of for one year.
[01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:48.553]  And then word for word,
[01:10:52.267 --> 01:11:00.916]  The big tech giants come out and say, we worship an AI God, we're going to be gods, we're going to live forever, but our AI God says, we have to kill 90% of you.
[01:11:00.916 --> 01:11:03.839]  Used to be 80, now it's 90.
[01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:06.642]  Then it's going to be 1%, then it's going to be 1 tenth of 1%.
[01:11:15.256 --> 01:11:21.378]  And Zuckerberg walks in and all his employees have the goggles on, hunched over in his false world that he sees.
[01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:22.098]  He's conscious.
[01:11:22.098 --> 01:11:23.538]  He's the God.
[01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:24.839]  They're in his false reality.
[01:11:24.839 --> 01:11:27.960]  And then Bezos strutting with the attack dog robot.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.760]  All the same thing.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.301]  I am ruling all this.
[01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:35.322]  And you can see it right there and they say,
[01:11:36.448 --> 01:11:37.848]  We have to reduce the world population.
[01:11:37.848 --> 01:11:43.770]  And then David Hogg is on Reddit saying, Hey, I love the fact that people are dying from mosquitoes.
[01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.731]  We need to save the earth.
[01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:49.492]  That's the religion!
[01:11:49.492 --> 01:11:53.634]  That's the religion!
[01:11:53.634 --> 01:12:00.176]  Because the computers and the factories are gonna be able to produce all the widgets and goods you want, but you're not gonna have access to any of it.
[01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:12.921]  You're not going to have access to any of it unless you submit to the Global Credit Score, the Global Social Score.
[01:12:12.921 --> 01:12:16.842]  Everybody keeps going, oh Alex, you got that from a Black Mirror episode about a year and a half ago.
[01:12:16.842 --> 01:12:19.483]  Everybody keeps saying, watch the Black Mirror, watch the Black Mirror episode.
[01:12:19.483 --> 01:12:25.345]  You keep talking about a digital score and how it's tied into the Internet of Things and the real world.
[01:12:25.345 --> 01:12:28.686]  If you're not popular on it, you won't be able to have a car, a house, or travel.
[01:12:29.426 --> 01:12:31.808]  Paul Watson wrote the article four years ago.
[01:12:31.808 --> 01:12:34.050]  The Communist Chinese announced it.
[01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.872]  Black Mirror was written a year later, that episode.
[01:12:36.872 --> 01:12:38.554]  They get it from reality.
[01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.515]  I'm not getting it from TV.
[01:12:40.515 --> 01:12:42.297]  They're getting it from us.
[01:12:42.297 --> 01:12:43.458]  Figured it out yet?
[01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:44.939]  We are the vanguard.
[01:12:44.939 --> 01:12:46.380]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.825]  We tell you about it before it's rolled out, hoping we can build momentum against it.
[01:12:55.097 --> 01:12:58.260]  They only announce it once it's ubiquitous and rolling out.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.962]  And I'm not bragging about how we're cutting edge.
[01:13:00.962 --> 01:13:04.365]  Everybody should be cutting edge!
[01:13:04.365 --> 01:13:06.027]  It's life and death, people!
[01:13:06.027 --> 01:13:09.650]  Our children!
[01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:14.354]  This system is total death.
[01:13:14.354 --> 01:13:17.877]  There are hundreds of millions of people that have gotten brain cancer from cell phones.
[01:13:17.877 --> 01:13:19.639]  I've got the big studies in front of me.
[01:13:19.639 --> 01:13:21.841]  Now it's getting even worse.
[01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:36.011]  Because the cell phone power and the 5G is going way more powerful, and they're gonna go, it doesn't matter we're all dying of cancer, it's Mother Earth cleansing us, merge with the machine, upload your brain, but to do it, you've gotta die.
[01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.952]  I told you that for over a decade.
[01:13:37.952 --> 01:13:39.113]  It was announced last week.
[01:13:39.733 --> 01:13:43.615]  We have the company, we can upload your brain, but you must die in the process.
[01:13:43.615 --> 01:13:44.776]  It's gonna be a con game.
[01:13:44.776 --> 01:13:46.297]  It's not gonna be your spirit.
[01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:47.417]  It's not gonna be you.
[01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:48.578]  It's a fraud.
[01:13:48.578 --> 01:13:58.164]  Just like computers can already 100% fake video and audio, it's the same crap!
[01:13:58.164 --> 01:14:00.425]  And these people have signed on to this 100%.
[01:14:00.425 --> 01:14:00.885]  So!
[01:14:08.097 --> 01:14:21.590]  If you want to use a modern cosmology, it's basically an interdimensional alien transmission meant to make us kill ourselves and metamorphosize into some type of silicon-based system that this spirit can interface with and control.
[01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.411]  It doesn't like free will.
[01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:24.973]  Now you can say, oh, that doesn't really exist.
[01:14:26.385 --> 01:14:28.688]  The AI tech giants say it does.
[01:14:28.688 --> 01:14:31.531]  They believe they're channeling interdimensional stuff.
[01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:33.753]  They go take DMT and ayahuasca.
[01:14:33.753 --> 01:14:35.916]  They've been doing this for 50 years at Berkeley.
[01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:37.237]  What do you think Berkeley is?
[01:14:37.237 --> 01:14:38.579]  It's a mushroom cult.
[01:14:38.579 --> 01:14:40.060]  It's a hallucination cult.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.723]  And they're in there, in these DMT trances.
[01:14:43.584 --> 01:14:51.369]  There's been books written about it being told, and you're going to have tablets, and then they're going to interface, and then the kids will be addicted, and then we're going to jack into your brain.
[01:14:51.369 --> 01:15:02.136]  And they're being told while in an interdimensional trance, at six-dimensional level, connected in, through your brain, in that trance, with demons, telling them how to build this stuff, and then it's being done.
[01:15:02.136 --> 01:15:04.798]  And let the media run wild with that.
[01:15:04.798 --> 01:15:06.799]  Everybody at a gut level knows the truth now.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.301]  So, that's what this is.
[01:15:11.301 --> 01:15:17.883]  We have been given technology to kill ourselves.
[01:15:17.883 --> 01:15:23.706]  And it's working quite well.
[01:15:23.706 --> 01:15:27.387]  And you can know it's just happened over and over again because it's formulaic.
[01:15:27.387 --> 01:15:29.788]  These entities aren't even very creative themselves.
[01:15:29.788 --> 01:15:32.809]  They are repeating stuff that's been done before.
[01:15:32.809 --> 01:15:36.111]  And I can just study it and see what it is and know.
[01:15:36.111 --> 01:15:37.551]  So, this is it.
[01:15:37.551 --> 01:15:38.852]  This is space invasion, folks.
[01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:41.270]  That's it.
[01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.151]  That's what it is.
[01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:53.105]  And they've got us turning on things that fry us and kill us, and then we beg to be part of it and move into areas that have the best 5G so we can get the biggest, fattest, juiciest brain tumors and have the best deformed babies.
[01:15:53.105 --> 01:15:54.507]  Now that ain't satanic.
[01:15:54.507 --> 01:15:55.247]  I'll kiss your butt.
[01:15:57.256 --> 01:15:59.157]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:59.157 --> 01:16:02.378]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:18.345]  Or warm and served.

[01:20:00.866 --> 01:20:03.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.526 --> 01:20:37.661]  When I grow up, I want us to be a type one civilization and not kill each other at the behest of some fallen entity.
[01:20:37.661 --> 01:20:44.186]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:44.186 --> 01:20:46.267]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:48.925 --> 01:20:58.047]  So there is a phenomenon where millions of people who were atheists are no longer atheists and have apologized to me, many of them.
[01:20:58.047 --> 01:21:03.748]  A lot of famous people off record saying, I used to be an atheist, I thought you were crazy believing in spiritual stuff.
[01:21:03.748 --> 01:21:10.310]  But when I take DMT or I take ayahuasca, I have conversations with advanced space aliens on spaceships.
[01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:14.931]  You know, they show me the future and it happens a week later.
[01:21:14.931 --> 01:21:16.031]  It's just incredible stuff.
[01:21:18.775 --> 01:21:24.562]  Or sometimes you take it and you get transported and put on a slave ship orbiting a star for a thousand years.
[01:21:24.562 --> 01:21:27.445]  That's what people are experiencing.
[01:21:27.445 --> 01:21:29.667]  I've never taken that stuff.
[01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:31.950]  I have studied CIA mind control.
[01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:34.072]  I've studied Berkeley where it was the main center of that.
[01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:36.998]  I have talked to people that were involved in those programs.
[01:21:36.998 --> 01:21:40.860]  I mean, professors and scientists and very successful people.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:49.526]  When I was a teenager and then in college, I started this show and some of the people I knew who were professors and folks said, you want to know what's really going on, kid?
[01:21:49.526 --> 01:21:52.968]  And I heard about this stuff 10 years before it was even in literature.
[01:21:52.968 --> 01:21:58.171]  And then you started saying it's like the CIA put out the LSD formulation in the 60s.
[01:21:58.171 --> 01:22:01.793]  Well, they've now decided to push the DMT, the ayahuasca, all of it.
[01:22:04.164 --> 01:22:10.006]  People are just falling to it, and they're having pretty much universal experiences.
[01:22:10.006 --> 01:22:16.468]  So they now believe there's a God, or gods, once they've taken this.
[01:22:16.468 --> 01:22:21.850]  Understand, I am not even saying all of this is real.
[01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:23.851]  I am telling you that this has been deployed
[01:22:24.909 --> 01:22:29.211]  By Silicon Valley and Big Tech to bring in a one-world religion.
[01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:36.836]  They believe that 90% of you must be exterminated or more before they attain godhood and merge with Silicon.
[01:22:36.836 --> 01:22:38.657]  Now I told you that 10 years ago in Endgame.
[01:22:38.657 --> 01:22:41.538]  I told you that 20 years ago on the radio.
[01:22:41.538 --> 01:22:42.279]  People made fun of it.
[01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:43.179]  The New York Times attacked it.
[01:22:43.179 --> 01:22:43.919]  Go watch Endgame.
[01:22:43.919 --> 01:22:44.580]  It's free online.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:23:01.509]  And it's everything you now see today, that the elite worship AI gods, that they believe they're going to become gods, that they believe while they take DMT and ayahuasca, these executives are just heavily into this stuff, that they're channeling the future.
[01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:05.992]  People think of an alien invasion as in the third dimension from space.
[01:23:05.992 --> 01:23:08.834]  There's dimensions below and above us, the mathematics show it.
[01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:10.855]  And whether it's real or not,
[01:23:14.827 --> 01:23:20.490]  You have these spirit guides, Mescalito and all this, Little Goatman.
[01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:25.533]  You know, you're taking DMT and Little Goatman shows up.
[01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.514]  He's not your buddy, okay?
[01:23:27.514 --> 01:23:29.335]  And he's got a plan though.
[01:23:29.335 --> 01:23:33.537]  You're gonna be a god as long as you kill everybody.
[01:23:33.537 --> 01:23:33.677]  Now...
[01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:37.191]  That's what I got into earlier.
[01:23:37.191 --> 01:23:47.557]  And whether you believe in this or not, the professors and the scientists and the ruling class, the people that own Time Life books, were taking LSD in the 40s.
[01:23:47.557 --> 01:23:52.840]  They made the decision that the CIA in the 50s should give it to the public.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.341]  But they only wanted it on universities.
[01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:57.722]  They don't want the general public taking it.
[01:23:57.722 --> 01:23:58.403]  It's mind control.
[01:23:59.758 --> 01:24:04.921]  And I'm not some square up here saying that LSD, you know, like, throw you in prison for it.
[01:24:04.921 --> 01:24:08.443]  I'm telling you historical facts here.
[01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:13.066]  The Unabomber was in an MKUltra LSD program.
[01:24:13.066 --> 01:24:14.807]  It's at Yale or Harvard, it's in the LA Times.
[01:24:14.807 --> 01:24:20.390]  Yeah, there's Mescalito, everybody sees that.
[01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.952]  And he's just got a nice plan for you, don't worry.
[01:24:23.952 --> 01:24:26.454]  Join him, you'll get a lot of power, and we're gonna kill everybody, but...
[01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:30.930]  If we kill everybody, you'll be a god, and if you believe that, you're an idiot.
[01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:37.312]  I mean, Baphomet shows up in your face, and people go, gee, I've seen this before.
[01:24:37.312 --> 01:24:53.038]  Gee, really bad people that sacrifice kids and stuff are into this dude, but he's here telling me, oh, I'm loving, I'm your friend, I'm here to take care of you, everything's great, and you have to understand, the leftist are weak-fallen people that are taking this stuff every weekend, folks.
[01:24:54.127 --> 01:24:59.829]  And they are into it, and they want power, and they believe it, and they want blood.
[01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:14.655]  And you got the darling movie star of the youth that they'll just join the establishment, David Hogg, in his Reddit, how he wants, you know, mosquitoes need to kill millions of people, it'll be good for the Earth, but he cares about 16 that are dead.
[01:25:14.655 --> 01:25:16.256]  It's a spirit!
[01:25:16.256 --> 01:25:18.537]  It's a transmission!
[01:25:18.537 --> 01:25:20.898]  The ancients didn't know what to call it, they called it a spirit!
[01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:23.079]  It's a transmission!
[01:25:26.434 --> 01:25:32.439]  And humans are receivers and broadcasters, transceivers.
[01:25:32.439 --> 01:25:43.448]  And you get these minds locked in, hypnotized by the television, hypnotized by the culture, and they get brought into this.
[01:25:43.448 --> 01:25:49.393]  And again, even if you don't believe in this, I'm telling you before anybody else told you.
[01:25:51.601 --> 01:26:01.684]  That Silicon Valley believe they're going to live forever and be gods, and they're building an AI world system that you will worship, that will interface with all your brains, and take control of your consciousness.
[01:26:01.684 --> 01:26:06.146]  And now Elon Musk comes out six months ago and says, I've been at the world government meetings.
[01:26:06.146 --> 01:26:08.486]  Almost all other billionaires want a world government.
[01:26:08.486 --> 01:26:10.327]  They want to reduce the population.
[01:26:10.327 --> 01:26:11.847]  They want to dumb you down.
[01:26:11.847 --> 01:26:14.488]  They want to take total control of you and your family.
[01:26:14.488 --> 01:26:18.369]  And beware people that worship AI gods.
[01:26:18.369 --> 01:26:20.030]  This way leads to total destruction.
[01:26:24.522 --> 01:26:26.243]  Oh, it's in the news every day, ABC News.
[01:26:26.243 --> 01:26:32.504]  DJ describes demonically possessed party goers at a rave where a man died from unknown drug.
[01:26:32.504 --> 01:26:49.129]  And here's the thing, the ancients would always start using this stuff, and it would be love, it would be science, it would open them up, but always, a hundred years later, there'd be a black pyramid, and they'd be chopping people's hearts out, or they'd be burning kids to bale.
[01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:51.890]  They'd be burning kids where they'd have a big
[01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:55.515]  Steel oven.
[01:26:55.515 --> 01:26:59.831]  With the hands of the God, you take your baby up with a 500 degree thing and watch it fry.
[01:27:01.155 --> 01:27:04.357]  You'd fry a baby on a basically outdoor barbeque pit and then eat it.
[01:27:04.357 --> 01:27:07.538]  Watch the priest pull an egg off your baby and just, ahhh.
[01:27:07.538 --> 01:27:09.959]  If that was in the Mediterranean.
[01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:13.701]  Or, if you were in England, Albion, they would come.
[01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:15.922]  A lot of times the man, the king, would give up his son.
[01:27:15.922 --> 01:27:18.063]  Oh, it's the time, the priest class, we want your son.
[01:27:18.063 --> 01:27:27.448]  Oh, we took your other son to be part of the priest class, but this son, we're going to slit his throat and bash his brains out and throw him into a peat bog.
[01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:33.613]  Or throw him on a bonfire, so you can term bond fire.
[01:27:33.613 --> 01:27:45.359]  And it was a pure exercise of priests taking hallucinogens and interfacing with entities that said, I will direct you.
[01:27:45.359 --> 01:27:57.006]  Every culture, Asians, Africans, Mesoamericans, every culture, starts taking hallucinogens
[01:27:58.379 --> 01:28:02.023]  And then starts worshipping entities that demand blood.
[01:28:02.023 --> 01:28:18.080]  And once you've taken it enough times, ladies and gentlemen, just like Substance D in PKD's Scanner Darkly, they've got a government rehab program to take you in.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:18.941]  It's the university.
[01:28:20.805 --> 01:28:24.346]  And now you're a programmable zombie they control.
[01:28:24.346 --> 01:28:32.570]  Now, if your will is very strong, and you can control it, they'll say, oh, you're in the priest class.
[01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:37.152]  But just like Faust, at the end of the day, you will be destroyed.
[01:28:37.152 --> 01:28:38.952]  Now, the time is short.
[01:28:38.952 --> 01:28:41.053]  That's why I'm giving you the secrets, folks.
[01:28:41.053 --> 01:28:45.095]  These are the deepest secrets of Silicon Valley, the Luciferians, all of them.
[01:28:46.564 --> 01:28:51.533]  I'm gonna get into more worldly issues and more temporal things happening now when we return.
[01:28:51.533 --> 01:28:54.358]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is an Emergency Transmission.
[01:28:57.577 --> 01:29:01.418]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Patreon?
[01:29:01.418 --> 01:29:03.139]  Well, now you don't have to be.

[01:29:08.241 --> 01:29:09.901]  Stop feeding the beast.
[01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:18.344]  Every post you make on those evil, anti-human, anti-American, perverted sites helps them destroy our families, our country, and our souls.
[01:29:18.344 --> 01:29:21.145]  Join Oneway today and take back your liberty.
[01:29:21.145 --> 01:29:25.407]  Your free speech alternative is waiting for you at Oneway.com.
[01:29:25.407 --> 01:29:25.967]  Oneway.com.
[01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.863]  Hear that?
[01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:34.267]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:34.267 --> 01:29:37.150]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:40.733]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:40.733 --> 01:29:48.319]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:29:48.319 --> 01:29:52.923]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:29:52.923 --> 01:29:55.345]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:55.345 --> 01:29:55.785]  Faketv.com
[01:29:58.629 --> 01:30:01.651]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:05.835]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:30:05.835 --> 01:30:12.540]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:16.303]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:30:17.003 --> 01:30:30.873]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[01:30:30.873 --> 01:30:36.457]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:41.178]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:30:41.178 --> 01:30:52.421]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:30:52.421 --> 01:30:57.523]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:30:58.403 --> 01:31:03.986]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we haven't in four years' life.
[01:31:03.986 --> 01:31:04.866]  It'd take hours.
[01:31:04.866 --> 01:31:07.287]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.287 --> 01:31:08.468]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.468 --> 01:31:10.089]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:10.089 --> 01:31:13.310]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:14.431]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.431 --> 01:31:17.612]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.612 --> 01:31:20.934]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.374 --> 01:31:21.514]  Yeah.
[01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:42.112]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[01:31:42.112 --> 01:31:43.494]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:31:43.494 --> 01:31:53.427]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:31:53.427 --> 01:31:56.472]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:31:57.876 --> 01:32:01.477]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.477 --> 01:32:03.238]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:03.238 --> 01:32:14.522]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.302 --> 01:32:24.467]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:24.467 --> 01:32:30.249]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:32:30.249 --> 01:32:35.012]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:35.532 --> 01:32:38.153]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:39.874]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.874 --> 01:32:49.859]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.859 --> 01:32:52.520]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:33:01.805]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:33:01.805 --> 01:33:04.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:33.258]  Well, I just laid out what the globalists are into, what their religion is.
[01:33:33.258 --> 01:33:42.222]  I just laid it out in the last two segments because whether it's real or not, or part of it's real and a lot of it's not true, this is the whacked out
[01:33:43.376 --> 01:33:53.202]  Programming that's in our brains, that in every culture, manifests itself when people start taking drugs.
[01:33:53.202 --> 01:34:12.174]  And that's what the Bible says, don't take pharmakia, don't get involved in, you know, wizardry and all this, because you will get knowledge, but all of it is like in the Islamic religion, which really just repeats the more ancient text of the cultures that picked up in the Middle East.
[01:34:13.607 --> 01:34:22.253]  A genie will give you what you want, but you've got to be very careful because it always designs to try to kill you or hurt you really bad.
[01:34:22.253 --> 01:34:30.939]  So if you ask for five tons of gold, ask for it to be set in front of you and not on top of you, because the genie will drop it on top of you.
[01:34:30.939 --> 01:34:32.620]  Now, do I really believe genies exist?
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:39.945]  No, I think that's a metaphor for the type of advanced knowledge that comes from the ether, comes from dark places in our brains.
[01:34:39.945 --> 01:34:40.646]  I don't know.
[01:34:41.824 --> 01:35:01.058]  All I know is, I've told you what's real, and what's been all the rage in our country's history and other nations' histories, and what is now manifesting itself in building a giant anti-human world government, where they're gonna put up 5, 6, 7G.
[01:35:01.058 --> 01:35:07.903]  The different reports say that 5G is, in some cases, hundreds of times more powerful.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.641]  than regular cell phone transmission radiation.
[01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:16.683]  Well, when they first came out with cell phones, they admitted it caused brain tumors.
[01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:17.923]  And that's in the news today.
[01:35:17.923 --> 01:35:32.348]  So, what species would know they were putting up transmitters all over the place that fry our DNA and fry our connection to God?
[01:35:32.348 --> 01:35:36.630]  What it is, is like a jamming system.
[01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.430]  And it's been shown.
[01:35:38.752 --> 01:35:49.516]  That long-term use of cell phones lowers brain waves, fries your brain, kills brain cells, causes brain damage, causes DNA breakage.
[01:35:49.516 --> 01:35:53.958]  Just search engine, even though Google drives these results down.
[01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:57.439]  Cell phone study damages DNA, breaks DNA strands.
[01:35:58.848 --> 01:36:06.235]  And they go, it's very curious, the microwave radiation vibrates at just the right frequency to break the DNA.
[01:36:06.235 --> 01:36:06.915]  They said it's funny.
[01:36:06.915 --> 01:36:09.197]  A little bit higher, it doesn't do it, a little bit lower.
[01:36:09.197 --> 01:36:16.904]  It's weird that this broadcast spectrum, it's the spectrum they've invented and they know about, just so happens to be the worst one.
[01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:24.091]  Just like the United States has a different flicker rate than Europe.
[01:36:24.091 --> 01:36:24.211]  And
[01:36:25.686 --> 01:36:28.087]  In Europe, they have a little bit different flicker rate.
[01:36:28.087 --> 01:36:43.212]  It's actually not the best one, but the United States had the best flicker rate that was chosen by federal standards back in the 50s and updated in the 70s to put you into a dream state.
[01:36:43.212 --> 01:36:46.773]  Not just suspended disbelief because you're watching the show, but
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:37:03.869]  A flicker right from the screen that mesmerizes you, that puts you into a literal near-dream state.
[01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:09.012]  And you go out and more than 80% of the people now on a bus or walking down the street
[01:37:11.817 --> 01:37:29.561]  They're not dialed into the universe, they're not dialed into their family, they're not dialed into their ancestors, they're not dialed into God, they're not dialed into the sun, the moon, the trees, the wind, they're not dialed into a homeless person sitting in vomit next to them, they're just dialed into that little tiny
[01:37:31.567 --> 01:37:36.291]  pinhole that is the projection of the establishment.
[01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:47.520]  And the establishment doesn't like the fact that we jacked into the matrix and that Infowars and Drudge and others operate in that spectrum.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.344]  So now they got everybody addicted, used to communicating with each other.
[01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:58.569]  Everyone talking to friends, to family, to neighbors, seeing baby pictures, talking to your mom, talking to your father.
[01:37:58.569 --> 01:37:59.990]  You know, my 11-month-old daughter
[01:38:01.004 --> 01:38:13.074]  When my middle daughter is with her mom, sometimes she'll call, or will call, and FaceTimer, and here's the phone.
[01:38:13.074 --> 01:38:18.659]  It's this radioactive device, it's got these problems, the globalists are watching what we're doing, but it's great technology.
[01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:20.180]  It has a good side to it.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.503]  The problem is it's being deployed for a bad side by the globalists.
[01:38:23.503 --> 01:38:25.965]  Technology itself is not bad, but you've got to be honest about it.
[01:38:28.689 --> 01:38:38.276]  She gets so excited when she talks on FaceTime, and then she calls the phone, hi, and my daughter's name.
[01:38:38.276 --> 01:38:43.919]  She sees phones and goes, I wanna talk to, at 11 months, I've got video of this.
[01:38:43.919 --> 01:38:56.448]  I just gotta bleep out my children's names, obviously, but I've got video of the baby crawling around, starting to take a few steps, trying to grab at your cell phone, saying, I wanna talk to my sister on that.
[01:38:56.448 --> 01:38:57.048]  Because to her,
[01:38:58.228 --> 01:39:02.411]  That's a system on her favorite person in the world.
[01:39:02.411 --> 01:39:04.173]  My middle daughter.
[01:39:04.173 --> 01:39:04.893]  It's not me.
[01:39:04.893 --> 01:39:05.754]  It's not my wife.
[01:39:05.754 --> 01:39:08.776]  It's that middle daughter.
[01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.178]  They just sync up in the room.
[01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.359]  They giggle and play for hours.
[01:39:12.359 --> 01:39:12.879]  They draw.
[01:39:12.879 --> 01:39:13.900]  They play with toys.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:14.500]  They roll around.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:18.023]  They're in love with each other in a sisterly way.
[01:39:18.023 --> 01:39:24.288]  And the fact that she gets to look into that crystal ball, that 11-month-old baby, that's magic.
[01:39:25.469 --> 01:39:28.690]  The magic of technology, and talk to her sister.
[01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:44.297]  When her sister's on vacation with mom for a week or whatever, and she's missing her, asking for her name, she starts pointing at the phone and says, hello, and her sister's name, and was just going, I want to talk, but now she's really talking.
[01:39:44.297 --> 01:39:48.078]  Surprise, my daughter's verbal.
[01:39:48.078 --> 01:39:52.480]  And she's so amazing.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.701]  And to think the system
[01:39:55.575 --> 01:39:56.996]  Wants to control and rule her life.
[01:39:56.996 --> 01:40:05.224]  And remember that all the major tech heads from Bill Gates to Steve Jobs said, we don't let our children have cell phones.
[01:40:05.224 --> 01:40:06.905]  We don't let them have iPads.
[01:40:06.905 --> 01:40:07.946]  It lowers their IQ.
[01:40:07.946 --> 01:40:11.989]  And there's thousands upon thousands of studies admitting all that.
[01:40:11.989 --> 01:40:19.756]  So I kind of went off the, not the deep end today, but important things to understand why all this evil is taking place.
[01:40:19.756 --> 01:40:20.917]  Why this is going on.
[01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:24.331]  Why people are so zombified.
[01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:26.913]  How this is an absolute brain-shipping program.
[01:40:26.913 --> 01:40:28.954]  And now they've got us addicted to phones, they go.
[01:40:28.954 --> 01:40:33.937]  USA Today, Associated Press, Reuters, NBC, CBS, London Guardian.
[01:40:33.937 --> 01:40:35.999]  You will take microchips.
[01:40:35.999 --> 01:40:38.561]  You will get them in your brain.
[01:40:38.561 --> 01:40:44.985]  Ready Player One.
[01:40:44.985 --> 01:40:45.886]  So it's here, folks.
[01:40:47.403 --> 01:40:51.065]  And it plugs you into a false reality and you say, well I get my friends, I get my family.
[01:40:51.065 --> 01:40:53.046]  They're removing that now.
[01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:57.128]  It's all bots, it's all fake avatars, it's all fake systems.
[01:40:57.128 --> 01:41:02.712]  It's all computer programs and AI systems coming in to manipulate the limbic system of the brain.
[01:41:02.712 --> 01:41:06.474]  To manipulate the dopamine areas.
[01:41:06.474 --> 01:41:10.136]  To attack the pineal gland.
[01:41:10.136 --> 01:41:12.057]  And what you are.
[01:41:12.057 --> 01:41:14.018]  This is the assault.
[01:41:16.144 --> 01:41:17.784]  This is the globalist program.
[01:41:17.784 --> 01:41:19.085]  All right, I gotta plug.
[01:41:19.085 --> 01:41:22.725]  I plugged 30 seconds last hour, and I know I'm my biggest problem.
[01:41:22.725 --> 01:41:28.186]  If I would just plug every segment, we could expand, do everything, and tip of the spear, defeat them.
[01:41:28.186 --> 01:41:32.427]  But it's up to you, because of my failures, to when you hear this message, to take action.
[01:41:32.427 --> 01:41:35.528]  We have the best supplements at the best prices.
[01:41:35.528 --> 01:41:41.869]  We go out, and we go, okay, other people mark up five or seven times, we mark up 100 to 150 times.
[01:41:41.869 --> 01:41:43.770]  That is, if something costs us $20, it's $40.
[01:41:47.247 --> 01:41:49.008]  And after all the other expenses, you know, it's more than that.
[01:41:49.008 --> 01:41:50.189]  And it varies item to item.
[01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:51.770]  Some stuff only has a 50% markup.
[01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:53.871]  Some things have a 200% markup.
[01:41:53.871 --> 01:41:59.435]  Uh, you know, because if it's like toothpaste, this costs us three bucks, you know, normally we sell for like 12 and it's discounted.
[01:41:59.435 --> 01:42:00.955]  I guess we only double the price.
[01:42:00.955 --> 01:42:07.700]  Bodies is back in stock, whole body support, ultimate turmeric product with a bunch of other key compounds to supercharge it.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:16.085]  It has a 95% turmeric rating, instead of only being 3% leading competitors because they're so cheap.
[01:42:18.463 --> 01:42:20.845]  It's got basically nothing but five-star reviews.
[01:42:20.845 --> 01:42:21.745]  You can go look at that.
[01:42:21.745 --> 01:42:22.646]  It's back in stock.
[01:42:22.646 --> 01:42:24.507]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:42:24.507 --> 01:42:27.169]  And we're going to have to end this special pretty much now.
[01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:31.832]  50% off Brain Force Plus and 50% off the real Red Pill.
[01:42:31.832 --> 01:42:32.712]  We have a seven-day challenge.
[01:42:32.712 --> 01:42:34.333]  Takes about seven days for Red Pill to kick in.
[01:42:34.333 --> 01:42:36.234]  Takes 30 minutes for Brain Force Plus.
[01:42:36.234 --> 01:42:36.835]  Totally healthy.
[01:42:37.495 --> 01:42:39.657]  A nature-based amazing boost.
[01:42:39.657 --> 01:42:41.058]  Clarity, focus, you name it.
[01:42:41.058 --> 01:42:42.499]  Infowars.com.
[01:42:42.499 --> 01:42:46.442]  Mother Nature has the compounds to help us battle the globalists and what they're up to.
[01:42:46.442 --> 01:42:47.923]  And your purchases make it all possible.
[01:42:47.923 --> 01:42:52.887]  So please shop with the good guys today and know that you're critical to beat Soros and the rest of them.
[01:42:52.887 --> 01:42:54.188]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:54.188 --> 01:42:54.768]  Infowars.com
[01:42:57.617 --> 01:43:03.920]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:12.325]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:43:12.325 --> 01:43:17.407]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:43:17.407 --> 01:43:20.849]  We only have 150%, and then it helps fund our operation.
[01:43:21.129 --> 01:43:23.951]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:43:23.951 --> 01:43:32.396]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:43:32.396 --> 01:43:34.197]  Rainforest takes about 30 minutes.
[01:43:34.197 --> 01:43:35.698]  But the two go together.
[01:43:35.698 --> 01:43:37.719]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[01:43:37.719 --> 01:43:46.865]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:47.205 --> 01:43:52.387]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.

[01:44:09.532 --> 01:44:14.819]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:44:14.819 --> 01:44:17.362]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:17.362 --> 01:44:21.587]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:21.587 --> 01:44:24.010]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:31.934]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:44:31.934 --> 01:44:33.154]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:44:33.154 --> 01:44:34.075]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:51.264 --> 01:44:54.746]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:44:54.746 --> 01:44:58.028]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:58.028 --> 01:45:01.450]  Introducing CellForce by Infowarslife.
[01:45:01.450 --> 01:45:05.413]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:05.413 --> 01:45:08.755]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.755 --> 01:45:11.296]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.296 --> 01:45:15.659]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:45:16.019 --> 01:45:18.360]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:25.382]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.382 --> 01:45:32.544]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.564 --> 01:45:38.627]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.627 --> 01:45:46.271]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.271 --> 01:45:51.174]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:45:51.174 --> 01:45:53.475]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.597 --> 01:46:09.061]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:46:09.061 --> 01:46:16.563]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:46:16.563 --> 01:46:26.466]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[01:46:26.926 --> 01:46:31.952]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:42.243]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:46:42.243 --> 01:46:47.629]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:46:48.089 --> 01:47:01.354]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:47:01.354 --> 01:47:03.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.916 --> 01:47:41.108]  Alright, I want to get into Sacramento where protesters jump in front of police cars so they can try to recreate what happened in Charlottesville to be victims.
[01:47:41.108 --> 01:47:42.489]  We're also going to DNC chair
[01:47:43.672 --> 01:47:48.255]  Vice Chair calls for repeal of the Second Amendment, while the leftist media says nobody wants your guns.
[01:47:48.255 --> 01:47:50.076]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:47:50.076 --> 01:47:51.698]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:56.481]  We're going to get more into DNA tests for IQ are coming, but it might not be smart to take one.
[01:47:56.481 --> 01:47:56.961]  Absolutely.
[01:47:56.961 --> 01:47:58.342]  This whole thing's a fraud in my view.
[01:47:58.342 --> 01:48:03.766]  And we're going to also get into the latest North Korea developments.
[01:48:03.766 --> 01:48:12.192]  But David Hogg says it's great corporate America is standing with me.
[01:48:13.783 --> 01:48:18.105]  Now we pointed out, corporate America basically to a company is anti-gun.
[01:48:18.105 --> 01:48:20.286]  They funded victim disarmament all over the world.
[01:48:20.286 --> 01:48:22.047]  Corporations want total control.
[01:48:22.047 --> 01:48:34.052]  And Soros' establishment, the Nazi collaborator, the Democratic Party's establishment, Hollywood's establishment, and it's pretty much all behind you, saying you're above even reproach, you cannot be criticized.
[01:48:34.052 --> 01:48:38.534]  So the fact that you say corporate America is standing with me, I thought the establishment was shaking in its boots.
[01:48:40.538 --> 01:48:48.949]  It's great that corporate America is standing with me and the rest of my friends because when you come against any one of us, whether it be me or anybody else, you're coming against all of us.
[01:48:48.949 --> 01:48:56.058]  And I think it's important that we stand together as both corporate and civic America to take action against these people and show them that they cannot push us
[01:48:56.118 --> 01:48:56.839]  So she needs to stand down?
[01:49:22.731 --> 01:49:25.632]  And stop saying you were whining, saying, why haven't I been let into a college?
[01:49:25.632 --> 01:49:28.394]  I mean, that is whining.
[01:49:28.394 --> 01:49:34.817]  And the fact that you're funded by Soros, a Nazi collaborator, and the fact that you're up there saying we're shaking in our boots, you are in an arena.
[01:49:34.817 --> 01:49:38.959]  So now you want somebody's sponsors taken because they disagree with you, Hogg.
[01:49:38.959 --> 01:49:44.802]  Now you're against the First Amendment, just like CNN in your name tried to get me removed off of YouTube.
[01:49:44.802 --> 01:49:50.545]  And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of publications over and over again piled on saying, why isn't he banned yet?
[01:49:55.523 --> 01:50:05.068]  That's in between him celebrating on Reddit that mosquitoes are killing millions of humans.
[01:50:05.068 --> 01:50:08.470]  Student activist concerned for life, not so apparent in online comments.
[01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:10.471]  I want to retweet that at Real Alex Jones.
[01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:11.451]  I want to get that story out.
[01:50:11.451 --> 01:50:12.632]  That is big.
[01:50:12.632 --> 01:50:15.993]  We need to force that out.
[01:50:15.993 --> 01:50:20.276]  Now here's Hogg saying the establishment is shaking in its boots.
[01:50:20.276 --> 01:50:22.136]  No, the establishment has armed guards.
[01:50:22.136 --> 01:50:22.817]  The establishment
[01:50:23.914 --> 01:50:27.536]  Once the general public disarmed, here it is.
[01:50:27.536 --> 01:50:33.499]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[01:50:33.499 --> 01:50:40.403]  They've gotten used to being protective of their position, ensuring safety, the safety of inaction.
[01:50:40.403 --> 01:50:47.867]  Inaction is no longer safe, and to that we say, no more.
[01:50:47.867 --> 01:50:51.429]  Now I'm gonna point this out right now.
[01:50:53.456 --> 01:51:01.802]  Mr. Hogg, if you really care about public health, why would you want mosquitoes to kill billions of people if you want to save every human life if you care about people so much?
[01:51:01.802 --> 01:51:11.648]  Why is the left always so pro-abortion, pro-depopulation, pro-eugenics, but we turn our guns in because 40-something young people die a year in mass shootings?
[01:51:11.648 --> 01:51:15.131]  That's too many, but it's still a very rare form of death.
[01:51:15.131 --> 01:51:16.031]  Why is that?
[01:51:16.031 --> 01:51:19.794]  But let me draw your attention to CBS News with the whitewash headline.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.322]  But you can read the article, there's thousands of these articles out right now.
[01:51:25.322 --> 01:51:35.108]  Top researchers, this is CBS News, have done a big study where cell phones are giving rats all sorts of cancers.
[01:51:35.108 --> 01:51:38.110]  You can go read the study, CBS News.
[01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:39.811]  Can cell phones cause cancer?
[01:51:39.811 --> 01:51:42.652]  Experts surprised by latest test.
[01:51:42.652 --> 01:51:48.596]  Seven paragraphs later, I'm sorry, eight paragraphs later, they tell you.
[01:51:49.821 --> 01:51:52.343]  Because they don't want the headline out there, cell phones give you cancer.
[01:51:52.343 --> 01:51:53.504]  It's always the same.
[01:51:53.504 --> 01:51:56.928]  Of the thousands of studies, it's always, do cell phones give you cancer?
[01:51:56.928 --> 01:52:00.091]  And then later, well, yeah, it does, but it's no big deal.
[01:52:00.091 --> 01:52:06.737]  They say they found clear evidence that phone radiation caused tumors in the hearts of rats, which were similar to tumors in people.
[01:52:06.737 --> 01:52:08.058]  Formerly tumors that didn't exist.
[01:52:08.058 --> 01:52:09.660]  There's all these new cancers.
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:14.685]  In humans, it's seen in the vestibular nerve in the ear.
[01:52:15.745 --> 01:52:17.626]  The acoustic nerve we found in the heart.
[01:52:17.626 --> 01:52:21.448]  Yeah, it particularly affects nerves because they're electrochemical.
[01:52:21.448 --> 01:52:39.518]  Although our animals were exposed in their whole body condition, John Butcher said, while a given animal is not making a cell phone call, they are throughout their short two-year lifespan getting the same exposure that we expect people to get, said the Doctor of Environmental Health Trust.
[01:52:39.518 --> 01:52:40.619]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:52:40.619 --> 01:52:43.981]  And it goes into all the brain tumor lawsuits.
[01:52:47.932 --> 01:53:05.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, they have hundreds of studies on just the fact that there's a new type of brain tumor you get, as they just said, on that particular nerve that goes into the brain, and it starts right there in the nerve, and it's whatever side of the head you tend to hold it to.
[01:53:05.959 --> 01:53:07.100]  Ted Kennedy, you name it.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:11.361]  I mean, these tumors, these types of tumors, were not even happening.
[01:53:11.361 --> 01:53:12.202]  Fifty years ago,
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:18.983]  Cancer doctors would get on an airplane to fly across the country to see a child with cancer.
[01:53:18.983 --> 01:53:29.048]  Now they're, go to the mall, every fifth child's got a shaved head and injector bags on them for the chemo.
[01:53:29.048 --> 01:53:35.752]  Or you'll go in a restaurant and there's a party for a kid and they look like they're about to die and you can tell they're on chemo and it's just like, you can't eat your dinner anymore.
[01:53:35.752 --> 01:53:41.415]  And you know, it's all of this and it's in the literature and it's a fact.
[01:53:43.473 --> 01:53:48.317]  There are studies on women that use cell phones and are in houses with Wi-Fi while they're pregnant.
[01:53:48.317 --> 01:53:52.821]  Lower IQs, more deformities, higher levels of cancer.
[01:53:52.821 --> 01:53:54.182]  All of it!
[01:53:54.182 --> 01:54:04.891]  But they tell us, don't worry about it, do it, do it, do it, be part of it, don't worry about it.
[01:54:04.891 --> 01:54:08.454]  Even though I know all this, and I've told them, I want wiring into all the computers.
[01:54:08.454 --> 01:54:09.975]  We've got to plug into a computer.
[01:54:09.975 --> 01:54:11.136]  We've got to wireless this building.
[01:54:12.432 --> 01:54:13.913]  Because I haven't gotten angry enough.
[01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:15.434]  I haven't demanded enough.
[01:54:15.434 --> 01:54:18.116]  At my house, I had wires put in everywhere.
[01:54:18.116 --> 01:54:20.957]  The last two houses, no one plugs into them, no one uses them.
[01:54:20.957 --> 01:54:22.178]  I said, use a laptop.
[01:54:22.178 --> 01:54:23.119]  Use an iPad.
[01:54:23.119 --> 01:54:24.440]  Use a computer desktop.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.660]  Don't use your phone.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.321]  Well, you know what?
[01:54:26.321 --> 01:54:27.702]  The phones are going.
[01:54:27.702 --> 01:54:29.803]  Because everybody's habituated to them.
[01:54:29.803 --> 01:54:31.424]  And the Wi-Fi's going.
[01:54:31.424 --> 01:54:33.205]  I don't care if it's a better system for the cameras.
[01:54:33.205 --> 01:54:34.006]  I don't care.
[01:54:34.006 --> 01:54:35.587]  It's killing us!
[01:54:35.587 --> 01:54:37.248]  I can't even control myself!
[01:54:39.724 --> 01:54:46.510]  Because like that globalist told me off record, Alex, the public's going to adapt to what we're doing to them.
[01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:48.151]  They're not going to adapt to resist it.
[01:54:48.151 --> 01:54:49.713]  You don't get what adaptation means.
[01:54:49.713 --> 01:54:53.176]  And I'm like, oh my God.
[01:54:53.176 --> 01:54:55.157]  Well, you know what?
[01:54:55.157 --> 01:54:58.140]  I am going to buck it.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:04.205]  I know all this stuff and I can't even stop it for my own family.
[01:55:04.205 --> 01:55:04.886]  So David Hogg,
[01:55:09.755 --> 01:55:18.167]  You need to realize, if you want to talk about something that's killing millions of people, not 40-something, how about you talk about radiation?
[01:55:18.167 --> 01:55:21.452]  How about we have walkouts in schools over cell towers on top of schools?
[01:55:21.452 --> 01:55:23.635]  How about we have walkouts over cell phone radiation?
[01:55:23.635 --> 01:55:26.139]  How about we have walkouts over all of that?
[01:55:27.278 --> 01:55:30.839]  Because this is what kills thousands of times what guns do every year.
[01:55:30.839 --> 01:55:36.461]  And this is how the globalists in this silent, invisible holocaust are killing everybody in their plan.
[01:55:36.461 --> 01:55:40.982]  And the globalists have these Wi-Fi-free retreats out in the middle of the wilderness that they're living in.
[01:55:40.982 --> 01:55:46.243]  A lot of the top billionaires are moving to the middle of nowhere, as I've told you and as is now admitted.
[01:55:46.243 --> 01:55:47.864]  Northern Canada.
[01:55:47.864 --> 01:55:48.784]  Kauai, Hawaii.
[01:55:51.203 --> 01:56:03.632]  Tasmania, New Zealand, and you read about these Wi-Fi free elite resorts and Wi-Fi communities that are Wi-Fi free, and they're all hardwired, hardwired.
[01:56:03.632 --> 01:56:16.822]  If you go to Zuckerberg's house, and you look at even some of the photos, they try to control, I've seen it, it's plugged in, plugged in, plugged in, plugged in, because then the radiation is chained down through that electron chain,
[01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:31.656]  It is not just blasting out like a irradiation bomb!
[01:56:31.656 --> 01:56:34.058]  I hope you listen to me.
[01:56:34.058 --> 01:56:37.080]  And I beg you listen for your family.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:39.162]  Because these people are evil.
[01:56:39.162 --> 01:56:42.085]  When we come back, I'm going to give the number out and get into the war on Easter.
[01:56:42.085 --> 01:56:43.546]  Google banned it.
[01:56:43.546 --> 01:56:44.227]  Google blocked it.
[01:56:45.493 --> 01:56:52.998]  And just briefly again, because I didn't plug good in the first hour, you need MycoZX that cuts out the mold, the yeast, the candida out of your gut.
[01:56:52.998 --> 01:56:55.539]  It's the other side of the probiotic equation.
[01:56:55.539 --> 01:56:58.561]  And it's now stronger, MycoZX+.
[01:56:58.561 --> 01:57:09.528]  You need BODY's ultimate turmeric product, 95% strong of the chemical that is in the ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:13.200]  And all the other things that supercharge it, that's back in.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.808]  60 day supply, big ol' bottle, absolutely jam-packed.
[01:57:17.236 --> 01:57:18.316]  All the five-star reviews.
[01:57:18.316 --> 01:57:22.257]  50% off Brain Force, 50% off the real red pill.
[01:57:22.257 --> 01:57:23.377]  That's about to end.
[01:57:23.377 --> 01:57:25.718]  25% off bodies, even though it's about to sell out again.
[01:57:25.718 --> 01:57:27.558]  We got a limited shipment in.
[01:57:27.558 --> 01:57:28.498]  Super high quality.
[01:57:28.498 --> 01:57:32.939]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:57:32.939 --> 01:57:33.819]  AAA2533139.
[01:57:33.819 --> 01:57:39.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've been put into a trance state artificially.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.701]  I'm here desperately trying to break you out of it.
[01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:42.081]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.256 --> 01:57:49.138]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:49.138 --> 01:57:50.379]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.379 --> 01:57:52.321]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:57:52.321 --> 01:58:01.710]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:58:02.504 --> 01:58:09.270]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:11.532]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:58:11.532 --> 01:58:12.593]  Thank you.
[01:58:12.593 --> 01:58:15.095]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:58:15.095 --> 01:58:19.398]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:58:19.398 --> 01:58:22.421]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:58:22.421 --> 01:58:23.742]  They are quality.
[01:58:23.742 --> 01:58:25.483]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:58:25.483 --> 01:58:28.226]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:58:28.226 --> 01:58:28.506]  Absolutely.
[01:58:28.646 --> 01:58:29.107]  Absolutely.
[01:58:29.107 --> 01:58:29.627]  That's right.

[01:59:51.331 --> 01:59:53.954]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.355 --> 02:00:11.522]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:00:11.522 --> 02:00:21.449]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:00:21.449 --> 02:00:24.191]  Scum!
[02:00:24.191 --> 02:00:26.072]  Russian scum!
[02:00:30.745 --> 02:00:37.049]  Reputation's amazing.
[02:00:37.049 --> 02:00:38.890]  I will not let you down.
[02:00:38.890 --> 02:00:41.772]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:00:46.508 --> 02:00:57.214]  Volcanic racism has violently erupted, and yet the media would have us all quietly look away from the urgency to write the dissent into madness.
[02:00:57.214 --> 02:01:13.762]  Deeming the increasing chaotic situation a far-right conspiracy, even after the testimony of brutality on Boer farmers in South Africa has been documented over and over, including graphic acts involving horrific evil child torture
[02:01:14.062 --> 02:01:18.666]  And the raping of entire families, followed by slow executions.
[02:01:18.666 --> 02:01:36.460]  The elderly couple that had boiling water poured over them, or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his Ford truck and trussed up, and then the truck set on fire and burned to death, or the little girl who was raped, the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men, survived it.
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:46.773]  And because she survived, you know, this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy, she was then bundled up in newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire.
[02:01:46.773 --> 02:01:53.242]  Or the girl who was crucified on her parents' kitchen table and then raped a three-year-old girl in this instance.
[02:01:53.242 --> 02:01:54.323]  A three-year-old girl raped by
[02:01:54.343 --> 02:01:54.423]  Wow.
[02:02:17.695 --> 02:02:19.697]  Um, I bought it legally.
[02:02:19.697 --> 02:02:22.740]  I paid every single penny I owe for it.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:25.523]  Every implement I bought on this farm, I paid for.
[02:02:25.523 --> 02:02:27.745]  I've worked for everything I've got.
[02:02:27.745 --> 02:02:28.927]  Now I must just hand it over.
[02:02:28.927 --> 02:02:31.129]  It doesn't seem fair.
[02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:34.933]  My little girl put up her hand and she said, but I've got a piggy bank.
[02:02:34.933 --> 02:02:36.054]  You can take my money.
[02:02:36.054 --> 02:02:37.895]  My husband said to me, please.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.522]  And the one guy said, oh, just kill him, brother.
[02:02:42.522 --> 02:02:45.023]  And they shot him between the eyes in front of us.
[02:02:45.023 --> 02:02:50.846]  They came with an iron, you know, a normal clothing iron.
[02:02:50.846 --> 02:02:58.870]  They burned me on my leg, telling him that they're going to hurt me if he doesn't open the safe.
[02:02:58.870 --> 02:03:03.112]  And he tried again, and then they burned him on his back.
[02:03:03.112 --> 02:03:08.055]  I was shot two times here, and once here in the neck, and it went outside my head.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:26.427]  Still, the South African communist grip on a white narrative spearheaded by a fantasy of white privilege, a sentiment left over from apartheid, allows South African leaders to continue to openly threaten white people.
[02:03:26.427 --> 02:03:34.149]  Australia says Malema, EFF want to kill white farmers.
[02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:37.091]  They must come to Australia.
[02:03:37.091 --> 02:03:37.631]  Faina.
[02:03:38.809 --> 02:03:41.511]  If they want to go, they must go.
[02:03:41.511 --> 02:03:51.179]  Recently, social media comments referring to white farmers made by Major Malala of the South African National Defence Force echoed the lunacy.
[02:03:51.179 --> 02:03:53.040]  Quote, apartheid is in him.
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.764]  All of these old white people think we are stupid when they say they were opposed to apartheid.
[02:03:58.084 --> 02:04:00.446]  We will not forget what they have done.
[02:04:00.446 --> 02:04:03.508]  Now it is the white people's turn.
[02:04:03.508 --> 02:04:11.253]  In fact, the whitest of white, albinos, are essentially hunted for their supposed magic properties in Africa.
[02:04:11.253 --> 02:04:20.279]  The South African reports, a traditional healer who allegedly killed two children with albinism appeared in a Whitbank court last month.
[02:04:20.279 --> 02:04:26.163]  Following that, the grave of an albino local was dug up in Piarnar near White River,
[02:04:26.403 --> 02:04:27.824]  That's a powerful report.
[02:04:27.824 --> 02:04:28.705]  It needs to get out.
[02:04:28.705 --> 02:04:29.386]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:05:00.002]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:05:00.002 --> 02:05:07.066]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:11.809]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:05:11.809 --> 02:05:12.569]  It's very simple.
[02:05:12.569 --> 02:05:15.051]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[02:05:15.051 --> 02:05:17.012]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[02:05:17.012 --> 02:05:18.813]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[02:05:18.813 --> 02:05:19.974]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:05:19.974 --> 02:05:20.714]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:05:25.677 --> 02:05:28.879]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:05:28.879 --> 02:05:33.142]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:05:33.142 --> 02:05:36.985]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the global threat of it.
[02:05:36.985 --> 02:05:40.867]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:05:40.867 --> 02:05:44.029]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:05:44.029 --> 02:05:47.672]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[02:05:47.672 --> 02:05:50.273]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[02:05:50.273 --> 02:05:51.274]  It's amazing.
[02:05:51.274 --> 02:05:53.876]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:06:07.346 --> 02:06:08.467]  Big Brother.
[02:06:08.467 --> 02:06:10.188]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:10.188 --> 02:06:12.270]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:13.911]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:13.911 --> 02:06:15.092]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:15.092 --> 02:06:20.276]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.443 --> 02:06:38.517]  Alright, I did a lot of preparation last night and this morning for the broadcast and I've only covered a thimble of the information because I went off on a jag about the Mark of the Beast and world government and all these studies submitting cell phones are causing massive increases in cancer and they're claiming though that they just discovered this.
[02:06:38.517 --> 02:06:43.261]  They've got a formulae where it's like, oh we just discovered, we just discovered.
[02:06:43.261 --> 02:06:45.823]  So that when your son or daughter gets cancer or you get cancer,
[02:06:47.056 --> 02:06:50.118]  You have this idea, like, oh, they didn't know before, they just now learned.
[02:06:50.118 --> 02:07:07.650]  So I'm sending my limited team, and I'm not complaining, but I need, like, a couple full-time people to be able to go to the UT Law Library and others and pull microfiche, because it's so powerful to show how stuff was reported 20, 30 years ago, and to show how they just now claim they learned about it.
[02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:10.292]  Oh, there is a world government!
[02:07:10.292 --> 02:07:14.415]  Oh, the Vatican does want a one-world government and says Jesus wasn't Christ and
[02:07:15.998 --> 02:07:16.898]  There's no hell.
[02:07:16.898 --> 02:07:18.319]  Oh, they just said that.
[02:07:18.319 --> 02:07:20.440]  No, they've been pushing it forever.
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:26.222]  And now, they're just going full bore with it.
[02:07:26.222 --> 02:07:27.402]  So, it's incredible.
[02:07:27.402 --> 02:07:29.483]  I want to take phone calls for the balance of the hour.
[02:07:29.483 --> 02:07:30.823]  The number for you to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:07:30.823 --> 02:07:30.883]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:30.883 --> 02:07:34.184]  You know, so much mainstream media misrepresents what I say and what I do.
[02:07:40.902 --> 02:07:46.123]  Because I'll get up here on air, and when I know something, and I know a fact, I'll say it.
[02:07:46.123 --> 02:07:50.164]  But a lot of times I go, I don't know what's up with David Hogg.
[02:07:50.164 --> 02:07:59.326]  Saying he wasn't at the school and rode three miles, and saying he was there and shooting videos during the supposed shooting.
[02:07:59.326 --> 02:08:07.207]  So the fact that when I don't know what's going on, and I'm just saying we should investigate this, this doesn't make sense, they then just project onto that whatever they want.
[02:08:07.207 --> 02:08:07.527]  Fine.
[02:08:07.527 --> 02:08:10.568]  So I want to explain this again, because it's so critical.
[02:08:13.271 --> 02:08:16.534]  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[02:08:16.534 --> 02:08:21.598]  I'm trying to get people thinking.
[02:08:21.598 --> 02:08:29.304]  I'm trying to talk about unpopular things that are unpopular in mainstream media to break the ice.
[02:08:29.304 --> 02:08:30.686]  And that's how we set the trends.
[02:08:30.686 --> 02:08:34.789]  That's how we make it safe for other people to come behind us.
[02:08:34.789 --> 02:08:35.189]  It's true.
[02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:37.211]  We are shock troops.
[02:08:37.211 --> 02:08:38.312]  That's what InfoWars is.
[02:08:38.312 --> 02:08:39.433]  We're the first people to hit.
[02:08:40.737 --> 02:08:44.879]  And to see how the enemy's gonna get drawn out, and to just get the job done.
[02:08:44.879 --> 02:08:50.141]  And that's what InfoWars is.
[02:08:50.141 --> 02:08:51.201]  That's what Prison Planet is.
[02:08:51.201 --> 02:08:52.102]  That's what NewsWars is.
[02:08:52.102 --> 02:08:56.584]  And that's why it needs your support, because it is the tip of the spear.
[02:08:56.584 --> 02:09:03.546]  And if you won't desert us, which you haven't done, we'll continue to change history together, and we'll continue to draw them out.
[02:09:03.546 --> 02:09:09.389]  And you will see their attacks become more and more overt, which again, only illustrates everything we've said.
[02:09:10.182 --> 02:09:22.452]  We were the first to tell folks about the world government, the first to tell people about cell tower cancer, the first people to tell folks about the TPP and the IMF and the World Bank and the whole globalist program and how the globalists rid of pedophilia and devil worship and all this stuff.
[02:09:22.452 --> 02:09:27.617]  Because everybody else that researches it knows it, they're scared to say it.
[02:09:27.617 --> 02:09:37.505]  Because 23 years ago when I went on air, there were a few researchers and a few people that had figured it out and they got killed.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:42.040]  They got murdered.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:51.606]  And I remember calling up and talking to their wives.
[02:09:51.606 --> 02:09:57.569]  People that wrote articles about the globalists and their master plan and their world government plan and their eugenics plan.
[02:09:57.569 --> 02:10:05.774]  And man, I mean, person after person I interviewed, when I first got on air, ended up getting shot in the back of the head walking out to the grocery store in the middle of nowhere, small town.
[02:10:08.038 --> 02:10:12.141]  Fell down the stairs and broke their neck or whatever and then I got the messages.
[02:10:12.141 --> 02:10:13.883]  Hey, you see what happened to Jim Keith?
[02:10:13.883 --> 02:10:17.826]  We'll kill your ass too!
[02:10:17.826 --> 02:10:22.049]  And that made me realize how real it was.
[02:10:22.049 --> 02:10:25.232]  And I said, well, there's no future if we don't fight this thing.
[02:10:26.892 --> 02:10:48.499]  So you see Trump, who's trying to guide this giant evil swamp and trying to just turn the productivity back on, admit free press is okay, promote free speech, break the back of political correctness, initiate nationalism again, which is the beginning of pulling away from globalism, killing TPP, all the things he's done.
[02:10:48.499 --> 02:10:51.741]  You look at this and then you see him in Rasmussen at 50 points.
[02:10:59.112 --> 02:11:04.377]  50 points!
[02:11:04.377 --> 02:11:07.280]  You know, I look at that picture of Hillary where they've added a pentagram and horns.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.321]  You don't even need it.
[02:11:08.321 --> 02:11:21.414]  That's the face she makes like a great white shark emerging out of the water.
[02:11:21.414 --> 02:11:22.535]  And then there's just those of us
[02:11:24.554 --> 02:11:28.778]  Pick up their will, and see their will, and go, man, that's really nasty and dirty.
[02:11:28.778 --> 02:11:30.579]  I'm gonna have to fight that.
[02:11:30.579 --> 02:11:34.703]  Not because we're heroes, but these people are evil.
[02:11:34.703 --> 02:11:42.950]  And an instinct as a man is trying to take care of your family, is you gotta fight.
[02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:45.372]  So, that's where we stand, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:46.989 --> 02:11:52.893]  CNN mocked for glorifying JFK's legendary infidelity after harping on sexual allegations against Trump.
[02:11:52.893 --> 02:11:59.937]  Yeah, Trump didn't say that he was Dudley perfect.
[02:11:59.937 --> 02:12:02.599]  And I'm sure it'd be better if he was.
[02:12:02.599 --> 02:12:05.681]  But you got Mike Pence, if that's, you know, what you're really into.
[02:12:05.681 --> 02:12:09.523]  If you don't care about what Trump did 10, 11, 12 years ago or whatever.
[02:12:09.523 --> 02:12:10.384]  Oh, he was nice to me.
[02:12:10.384 --> 02:12:11.284]  Oh, he had sex once.
[02:12:11.284 --> 02:12:13.746]  Oh my God, he's a devil.
[02:12:13.746 --> 02:12:15.107]  And oh, it's a full grown woman.
[02:12:16.954 --> 02:12:18.835]  That's why they don't like Trump.
[02:12:18.835 --> 02:12:20.756]  He's just normal.
[02:12:20.756 --> 02:12:21.657]  Doesn't mean he's not worldly.
[02:12:21.657 --> 02:12:22.297]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[02:12:22.297 --> 02:12:23.398]  He's just not out to get you.
[02:12:23.398 --> 02:12:24.639]  He isn't into kids.
[02:12:24.639 --> 02:12:27.441]  He doesn't get on Jerry Epstein's plane with little kids.
[02:12:27.441 --> 02:12:28.481]  He's not involved in all that.
[02:12:28.481 --> 02:12:32.864]  He's not into spirit cooking.
[02:12:32.864 --> 02:12:37.307]  He's into hamburgers.
[02:12:37.307 --> 02:12:39.628]  And he's into fighting scumbags.
[02:12:39.628 --> 02:12:41.810]  Trump doesn't like scumbags.
[02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:43.671]  And he's going to show them.
[02:12:46.678 --> 02:12:54.825]  So, people fundamentally get beyond hypocrisy of this, and they're angry about it.
[02:12:54.825 --> 02:12:56.567]  And that's why Trump's poll is up.
[02:12:56.567 --> 02:12:58.588]  They know he's under attack.
[02:12:58.588 --> 02:13:00.450]  They've figured out what's going on.
[02:13:00.450 --> 02:13:05.414]  There's a story here on Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:13:05.414 --> 02:13:06.095]  Shocked poll.
[02:13:06.095 --> 02:13:10.599]  Majority of Dems don't fully trust mainstream media.
[02:13:10.599 --> 02:13:12.300]  And it goes through all the numbers.
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.222]  77% of Americans now believe MSN pushes fake news.
[02:13:15.523 --> 02:13:21.345]  And you see authoritarian regimes like Malaysia saying 10-year sentences if the government says it's fake news.
[02:13:21.345 --> 02:13:24.946]  Oh, well, in a tyranny, of course they're going to say the truth is fake news.
[02:13:24.946 --> 02:13:38.171]  So, they've made a really reckless bet here in Europe and the United States and other areas that they're going to be able to bully everybody and kick them off Facebook or Twitter or restrict people.
[02:13:44.912 --> 02:13:47.074]  And that you'll just self-censor and go away?
[02:13:47.074 --> 02:13:49.496]  No!
[02:13:49.496 --> 02:13:54.100]  We understand historically, if we don't go through some pain now, we lose it all.
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:14:01.546]  That's why I go back to this fundamental that globalist minions don't seem to get, so I harp on it all the time now because I want to explain it to them.
[02:14:01.546 --> 02:14:09.152]  If you take my sponsors or you sue me or even you shut me down, do you understand I've already won getting the message out and ringing the alarm?
[02:14:09.152 --> 02:14:09.993]  That was my job.
[02:14:11.826 --> 02:14:27.534]  If I get an arrow shot through me, because I found traitors trying to lower the drawbridge to the enemy at night, and I ring the alarm and flip the switch to raise it again, and then somebody stabs me in the back, a traitor, and I end up dying, hey, you don't burn the whole castle and my family inside.
[02:14:27.534 --> 02:14:28.875]  You don't take it all down.
[02:14:28.875 --> 02:14:30.156]  I'm not a traitor.
[02:14:30.156 --> 02:14:34.238]  And they just don't get, they claim they're collectivists, they are the most satanic
[02:14:35.038 --> 02:14:36.259]  individualist you've ever seen.
[02:14:36.259 --> 02:14:38.040]  Because Satanism is all about being an individual.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:38.660]  All about yourself.
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:44.103]  It's a counterfeit of being a real individual who loves individuality and respects other people's individuality.
[02:14:44.103 --> 02:14:46.324]  Because Satanists always want to make other people non-individuals.
[02:14:46.324 --> 02:14:47.544]  They want to make them slaves.
[02:14:47.544 --> 02:14:49.045]  But they're this individual that rules.
[02:14:49.045 --> 02:14:50.366]  They're slave masters.
[02:14:50.366 --> 02:14:51.426]  See, it's all twisted.
[02:14:51.426 --> 02:15:03.332]  No, you're real individuals, but also you can supersede your individualism for your own personal gain for the larger continuum, realizing you're surfing on all the capital of people that sacrificed before you.
[02:15:04.718 --> 02:15:07.300]  And then it's the holy act.
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:08.421]  It is the true act.
[02:15:08.421 --> 02:15:13.105]  It is the act of will to then give yourself to the greater cause.
[02:15:13.105 --> 02:15:14.687]  That is transcendence.
[02:15:14.687 --> 02:15:18.630]  And then you project forward into your children and others and building a better world.
[02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:23.795]  And that is the real majesty of God's plan.
[02:15:23.795 --> 02:15:26.778]  Then there's no more fear, except not following God's plan.
[02:15:27.864 --> 02:15:30.325]  The only failure is not joining God.
[02:15:30.325 --> 02:15:36.087]  The only failure is letting the enemy turn you into a coward and caring what they say about you.
[02:15:36.087 --> 02:15:40.368]  Why do you care what zombies and devil worshippers and pedophile and scum say to you?
[02:15:40.368 --> 02:15:45.010]  And why do you care what they even do to you when you're fighting them to defend the innocent?
[02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:47.811]  You should fear them getting the whole world.
[02:15:47.811 --> 02:15:52.092]  But more than that, you should fear in the eyes of God failing.
[02:15:52.092 --> 02:15:53.373]  God's looking on.
[02:15:53.373 --> 02:15:54.413]  Fear God, not man.
[02:15:55.251 --> 02:15:57.872]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[02:19:16.363 --> 02:19:16.784]  Absolutely.
[02:19:36.704 --> 02:19:48.408]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:20:26.583 --> 02:20:35.369]  I'm going to Alex, Rob, Uncle Sam, Bill, Debra, Manny, Forrest, Pastor Sam, Jeff, Jason, everybody right now.
[02:20:35.369 --> 02:20:37.731]  Just the bottom line is this.
[02:20:37.731 --> 02:20:38.732]  This is a spiritual war.
[02:20:39.758 --> 02:20:43.299]  That just means other dimensions, which they've mathematically proven.
[02:20:43.299 --> 02:20:52.843]  Top scientists, NASA, has found power sources many times more powerful than this dimension, holding everything in place.
[02:20:52.843 --> 02:20:54.323]  All these billionaires are coming out.
[02:20:54.323 --> 02:20:57.925]  Heads of Bank of America came out and said, this is all false.
[02:20:57.925 --> 02:20:58.765]  We're in a prison.
[02:20:58.765 --> 02:21:00.406]  There's an outside God controlling it.
[02:21:00.406 --> 02:21:02.006]  The mathematics shows it.
[02:21:02.006 --> 02:21:04.307]  We're going to break out of it.
[02:21:04.307 --> 02:21:06.188]  That is directly Lucifer talk.
[02:21:09.878 --> 02:21:13.080]  You just realize that that's what we're really on.
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:15.782]  A planet as a test.
[02:21:15.782 --> 02:21:18.524]  Here in the third dimension.
[02:21:18.524 --> 02:21:23.768]  And the globalists believe they've got to kill everybody to get total control.
[02:21:23.768 --> 02:21:25.449]  And this is what they really say.
[02:21:25.449 --> 02:21:27.791]  This is what Elon Musk is warning you of.
[02:21:27.791 --> 02:21:30.073]  This is what the Pentagon now knows is going on.
[02:21:33.942 --> 02:21:44.908]  And that's why the Pentagon and everybody else has resonated that's actually in the know with this broadcast, because they know I'm not just sitting here saying stuff to be shocking.
[02:21:44.908 --> 02:21:48.109]  Now, we've got the first caller here.
[02:21:48.109 --> 02:21:51.991]  Rob in Chicago says brain cancer from cell phones, says he knew about it in the 70s.
[02:21:51.991 --> 02:21:54.973]  Yeah, I read it in USA Today in 1988.
[02:21:54.973 --> 02:22:03.117]  I was a high school freshman, because I remember arguing with people saying, no, I read it in USA Today, it can give you cancer.
[02:22:03.786 --> 02:22:06.467]  And they said, oh, they wouldn't let that happen.
[02:22:06.467 --> 02:22:10.047]  And the point is, it's like a notice, a legal notice they put in the paper.
[02:22:10.047 --> 02:22:14.988]  Or it's like a notice on the cigarette packs, known to the surgeon general to give you cancer.
[02:22:14.988 --> 02:22:16.169]  They're always written the same.
[02:22:16.169 --> 02:22:18.969]  Again, I have seen, no exaggeration, everybody's seen it.
[02:22:18.969 --> 02:22:22.490]  Remember this, Ruber says he hopes you don't have a memory.
[02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:26.931]  Thousands and thousands, I mean, I've seen like 15 today.
[02:22:26.931 --> 02:22:29.651]  You guys printed me a big stack.
[02:22:29.651 --> 02:22:32.772]  Of them saying, first time it's proven it causes brain cancer, look out.
[02:22:35.461 --> 02:22:39.024]  And I've seen that, they always say that, like they just discovered it.
[02:22:39.024 --> 02:22:46.549]  And it's this psychological warfare deal, where they want to be able to say, oh, we're just warning you.
[02:22:46.549 --> 02:22:56.456]  So the idea is we just learned, we just learned, so that when you get the brain tumor, subconsciously, 30 years from now, 20 years from now, 5 years from now, you go, oh, we just learned.
[02:22:56.456 --> 02:22:57.837]  See how evil they are?
[02:22:59.773 --> 02:23:09.603]  There's a big Sinclair video, and I'm not even saying Sinclair is the worst thing on the planet, they're based out of here in Texas, but it showed how hundreds of Sinclair TV channels have the exact same script and the exact same words.
[02:23:09.603 --> 02:23:14.167]  It's a viral video right now, Marley gave it to me last night, I meant to give it to you guys, you can look it up.
[02:23:14.167 --> 02:23:22.196]  But it just shows, at the end it shows like a, it's almost a hundred TV screens all together, and them all in unison saying the same thing.
[02:23:22.196 --> 02:23:23.217]  There it is, Sinclair Media.
[02:23:24.545 --> 02:23:26.907]  Dozens of local news anchors recite the same script.
[02:23:26.907 --> 02:23:27.768]  No, it's not dozens.
[02:23:27.768 --> 02:23:30.330]  That's the next to last video file.
[02:23:30.330 --> 02:23:32.672]  It shows the last one and it's got to be a hundred up there.
[02:23:32.672 --> 02:23:41.639]  But the point is, I love the New York Times telling people... I love the New York Times telling people...
[02:23:42.742 --> 02:23:45.806]  That there's talking points when they're the kings of it, and that's where it rolls downhill.
[02:23:45.806 --> 02:23:47.288]  But by the way, go back to that page.
[02:23:47.288 --> 02:23:50.191]  I remember reading they changed the headline about repeal of the Second Amendment.
[02:23:50.191 --> 02:23:50.732]  And scroll down.
[02:23:50.732 --> 02:23:51.113]  There it is.
[02:23:51.113 --> 02:23:51.974]  Scroll down.
[02:23:51.974 --> 02:23:52.614]  Scroll down.
[02:23:52.614 --> 02:23:56.279]  Remember, they said, oh, we never said... Yeah, go back to the main page.
[02:23:56.279 --> 02:23:57.941]  It had a box of other articles below it.
[02:23:57.941 --> 02:24:00.164]  And I'd forgotten to get to that, too.
[02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:01.426]  They changed the headline.
[02:24:02.691 --> 02:24:05.713]  When you go to that article about repeal of the Second Amendment, they changed it.
[02:24:05.713 --> 02:24:07.394]  Because that, see, that didn't work right.
[02:24:07.394 --> 02:24:08.435]  They were testing with you.
[02:24:08.435 --> 02:24:10.396]  It's all psychological warfare.
[02:24:10.396 --> 02:24:11.357]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:24:11.357 --> 02:24:14.018]  You have to figure out, why am I being given this talking point?
[02:24:14.018 --> 02:24:21.483]  I'm not even sure why since 1988, when I first paid attention, they always say, we just learned.
[02:24:21.483 --> 02:24:22.444]  We didn't know.
[02:24:22.444 --> 02:24:24.465]  We just learned.
[02:24:24.465 --> 02:24:27.587]  But it's so, when you get the brain tumor or the heart tumor,
[02:24:32.093 --> 02:24:38.255]  When you learn about this, you'll just remember they just learned.
[02:24:38.255 --> 02:24:39.335]  That's the message.
[02:24:39.335 --> 02:24:39.896]  That's the headline.
[02:24:39.896 --> 02:24:40.596]  They just learned.
[02:24:40.596 --> 02:24:41.256]  They just learned.
[02:24:41.256 --> 02:24:42.056]  They just learned.
[02:24:42.056 --> 02:24:45.778]  So you have to look at each PR piece and go, what am I being given here?
[02:24:45.778 --> 02:24:47.718]  What is the agenda behind that?
[02:24:47.718 --> 02:24:49.519]  And you think of that as exhausting.
[02:24:49.519 --> 02:24:50.339]  It's not.
[02:24:50.339 --> 02:24:52.080]  It's what your brain's meant to do.
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.861]  When you just accept stuff, you get Alzheimer's.
[02:24:54.861 --> 02:24:56.621]  You get neurological disorders.
[02:24:56.621 --> 02:24:59.902]  But when you make your brain go, what is that I'm being given?
[02:24:59.902 --> 02:25:01.723]  That's what builds your brain, just like a muscle.
[02:25:05.956 --> 02:25:09.837]  To the point now, I can be with top, I'm not even bragging, top lawyers.
[02:25:09.837 --> 02:25:12.798]  And I'll say, this is the legal argument, and this is the thing, and they go, well, how'd you know that?
[02:25:12.798 --> 02:25:14.779]  That's actually the top Supreme Court case.
[02:25:14.779 --> 02:25:17.820]  And I go, I don't need to know it, I know what logic is.
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:18.760]  And they go, you're right.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:24.082]  And now, all the logic of previous laws being assaulted with disinformation and false logic.
[02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:26.283]  And that's what this all is, is jamming logic.
[02:25:26.283 --> 02:25:28.143]  We all know what common sense is.
[02:25:28.143 --> 02:25:29.223]  We all know what's good.
[02:25:29.223 --> 02:25:30.664]  We all know what's right.
[02:25:30.664 --> 02:25:33.605]  We all instinctively understand the globalists are the enemy, not the Russians.
[02:25:35.285 --> 02:25:39.629]  That's why they want to bombard us and bully us into just, fine, I'll give in to whatever you say!
[02:25:39.629 --> 02:25:40.129]  No!
[02:25:40.129 --> 02:25:41.270]  That's death!
[02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:43.092]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls and I apologize.
[02:25:43.092 --> 02:25:45.834]  Rob in Chicago, on brain cancer.
[02:25:45.834 --> 02:25:48.076]  I see in the comment you say you knew about this in the 70s.
[02:25:48.076 --> 02:25:48.597]  Tell me about it.
[02:25:48.597 --> 02:25:50.198]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:25:50.198 --> 02:25:54.182]  And what I didn't mention to the screeners, in fact, I am a brain tumor survivor.
[02:25:54.182 --> 02:25:54.342]  Wow.
[02:25:55.470 --> 02:26:04.600]  Yes, but I was an amateur radio operator and we knew about this in the 1970s and we all were shielding our equipment.
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:07.302]  Evidently, it didn't help me much, but I'm still here.
[02:26:07.302 --> 02:26:12.448]  Well, I talked to a good friend of mine who's getting up there in years.
[02:26:12.448 --> 02:26:13.409]  We've got to get him in studio.
[02:26:13.409 --> 02:26:15.270]  He's a pretty humble guy, but he was an army officer in
[02:26:18.365 --> 02:26:26.035]  North Africa, and I'm trying to remember the exact, see I always tell these stories and they kind of get weird because I tell you the exact story and then I think I have the story and I'm trying to pull it up.
[02:26:26.035 --> 02:26:31.442]  It was, what's the Christian country in Africa where a lot of people are actually Jewish?
[02:26:33.407 --> 02:26:39.912]  What is the name of that, uh, the ancient African, where they think the Ark of the Covenant may be hidden.
[02:26:39.912 --> 02:26:41.874]  Gosh, now I've had one of those neurotic moments.
[02:26:41.874 --> 02:26:45.136]  You guys pull up, uh, it's not Ethiopia, it's Ethiopia.
[02:26:45.136 --> 02:26:46.518]  Okay, Ethiopia.
[02:26:46.518 --> 02:26:56.325]  And he was stationed for several years, super clandestine radio station, transmitting to operatives on secret bands, but also picking up Russian transmissions out of the Middle East.
[02:26:56.325 --> 02:27:01.309]  And he said, this was in the late 60s, they got manuals saying,
[02:27:02.250 --> 02:27:08.552]  Don't tell the rest of the men that they've been around something that could literally kill you on sight.
[02:27:08.552 --> 02:27:10.933]  These transmitters are so powerful.
[02:27:10.933 --> 02:27:13.214]  These microwave relays are so powerful.
[02:27:13.214 --> 02:27:15.755]  And the shielding's going to be shipped to you.
[02:27:15.755 --> 02:27:20.296]  Put it up, but tell them it's because the equipment's classified now and they can't touch it or something.
[02:27:20.296 --> 02:27:22.337]  Just tell them some BS story.
[02:27:22.337 --> 02:27:28.139]  And he was like, wow, we were already putting our cans of beans on top of it to heat it.
[02:27:29.451 --> 02:27:32.652]  And he said almost all those guys he knew died of cancer.
[02:27:32.652 --> 02:27:38.293]  He didn't even know that was going on, but he was an officer, so he wasn't running the transmissions or servicing them, but he got cancer from it later.
[02:27:38.293 --> 02:27:39.193]  So think about that.
[02:27:39.193 --> 02:27:40.874]  Heating the beans on it, brother.
[02:27:40.874 --> 02:27:42.014]  Go ahead.
[02:27:42.014 --> 02:27:46.395]  You can only imagine what the HAARP transmitters are doing up in Alaska.
[02:27:46.395 --> 02:27:46.755]  Exactly.
[02:27:46.755 --> 02:27:47.156]  I'll shut up.
[02:27:47.156 --> 02:27:47.816]  You got the floor.
[02:27:47.816 --> 02:27:48.776]  Tell people about what happened to you.
[02:27:49.895 --> 02:27:51.156]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:51.156 --> 02:28:04.303]  No, just long story short, I was an electrician by trade, but I ended up with a brain tumor in 1985, which is several years later, and I was fortunate enough to survive.
[02:28:04.303 --> 02:28:07.385]  I'm still here, and thank God.
[02:28:07.385 --> 02:28:11.848]  I think God was watching me because I ended up with one of the top three neurosurgeons in the country.
[02:28:13.103 --> 02:28:13.984]  Well, that's a blessing.
[02:28:13.984 --> 02:28:16.766]  I'm going to hold you over because I want to hear from you about this.
[02:28:16.766 --> 02:28:17.787]  What is it like for you?
[02:28:17.787 --> 02:28:24.373]  I mean, you're saying, did the doctors admit to you that they thought it was electromagnetic-caused cancer?
[02:28:24.373 --> 02:28:28.416]  No, they never said what the cause was or could be.
[02:28:28.416 --> 02:28:33.440]  But, you know, it's just speculation on my part because I know that
[02:28:36.315 --> 02:28:53.545]  I want to come back and talk about what is it like for you to see the children all with these handheld transmitters that are getting stronger and stronger and stronger and are known to cause brain tumor.

[02:30:31.238 --> 02:30:32.258]  I haven't felt sweet.
[02:30:32.258 --> 02:30:33.919]  My morning was fantastic.

[02:30:45.223 --> 02:30:47.044]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:30:47.364 --> 02:30:51.789]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:51.789 --> 02:30:53.631]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:56.513 --> 02:31:02.114]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[02:31:02.114 --> 02:31:02.974]  It'd take hours.
[02:31:02.974 --> 02:31:05.415]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:31:05.415 --> 02:31:06.595]  It's stronger.
[02:31:06.595 --> 02:31:08.195]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:31:08.195 --> 02:31:11.416]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:31:11.416 --> 02:31:12.536]  It's back in stock.
[02:31:12.536 --> 02:31:15.717]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:31:15.717 --> 02:31:16.857]  It's got the preglanone.
[02:31:16.857 --> 02:31:19.498]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:31:19.498 --> 02:31:22.598]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[02:31:22.598 --> 02:31:23.339]  So you can upload it.
[02:31:23.339 --> 02:31:24.939]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[02:31:25.399 --> 02:31:28.141]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:31:56.316 --> 02:32:02.621]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[02:32:02.621 --> 02:32:11.027]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[02:32:11.027 --> 02:32:16.110]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[02:32:16.110 --> 02:32:16.871]  We only have 150%.
[02:32:16.871 --> 02:32:17.992]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[02:32:19.833 --> 02:32:22.655]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[02:32:22.655 --> 02:32:31.080]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:32.901]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[02:32:32.901 --> 02:32:34.401]  But the two go together.
[02:32:34.401 --> 02:32:36.443]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[02:32:36.443 --> 02:32:45.568]  They're both 50% off individually, or together they're 50% off, and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:45.908 --> 02:32:51.113]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[02:32:51.113 --> 02:32:58.701]  InfoHorseLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[02:32:58.701 --> 02:33:01.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.439 --> 02:33:27.523]  Yeah, he just joined us.
[02:33:27.523 --> 02:33:34.067]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.067 --> 02:33:39.210]  So here's the 60 quadrillion dollar question, the thing that's going to kill billions of people, they estimate.
[02:33:39.210 --> 02:33:42.251]  Already killed hundreds of millions, that's in mainline science.
[02:33:42.251 --> 02:33:46.734]  Because now they're increasing the power, the radiation, the transmitters, the 5G, 6G, all of it.
[02:33:48.058 --> 02:34:08.595]  Why did the scientists know when they were getting cell towers approved in the 80s and all of this, and they knew back in the military before that, that you put the transmitter site out away from the building because you're getting massive radiation off of that, for whatever the length of the antenna is, is the basic rule of law.
[02:34:08.595 --> 02:34:09.116]  Rule of thumb.
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:16.743]  And so, if the antenna is 50 feet long, well 50 feet away, you're getting 100% of that transmission power.
[02:34:16.743 --> 02:34:20.785]  You can't walk up to a big AM transmitter and grab it, it'll burn you!
[02:34:20.785 --> 02:34:24.527]  You stand up next, you'll start throwing up!
[02:34:24.527 --> 02:34:26.408]  This is not our opinion!
[02:34:26.408 --> 02:34:32.171]  Well, what do you think... What do you think cell phones are?
[02:34:32.171 --> 02:34:36.593]  They're high-powered microwave relay systems.
[02:34:36.593 --> 02:34:36.713]  And...
[02:34:37.765 --> 02:34:43.748]  Yeah, if you keep a few feet away from you and use a little wireless thing that's just radio waves to it, that's not as bad, but it's still terrible.
[02:34:43.748 --> 02:34:44.928]  It's killing our DNA.
[02:34:44.928 --> 02:34:46.609]  It's killing our fertility.
[02:34:46.609 --> 02:34:48.910]  It's causing neurological problems, behavior problems.
[02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:51.131]  It's linked to it all.
[02:34:51.131 --> 02:35:00.656]  I remember studies about cell phones and hyperactivity disorder in adults and anxiety disorders 20 years ago!
[02:35:00.656 --> 02:35:03.457]  Scientific American, all of it.
[02:35:03.457 --> 02:35:04.778]  They already knew all this.
[02:35:04.778 --> 02:35:06.719]  It was already tested in rats when they deployed it.
[02:35:07.501 --> 02:35:07.902]  Why?
[02:35:07.902 --> 02:35:09.123]  Why?
[02:35:09.123 --> 02:35:22.319]  I remember DARPA in the, I could never find the article, but it was in the Baltimore Sun, said we're testing cell phone towers to calm the public with the waves we're sending out from the towers, but also through the cell phones.
[02:35:23.399 --> 02:35:26.320]  So we're way down the road here in mind control.
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.101]  I don't even know 10% of it.
[02:35:28.101 --> 02:35:31.263]  What I know is all public and nightmare level.
[02:35:31.263 --> 02:35:32.383]  So I said, I got 20 calls.
[02:35:32.383 --> 02:35:32.964]  I'll go to y'all.
[02:35:32.964 --> 02:35:35.445]  Uh, let's go ahead and finish up.
[02:35:35.445 --> 02:35:39.587]  Uh, Rob in Chicago said you got brain cancer from being around this stuff.
[02:35:39.587 --> 02:35:41.548]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[02:35:41.548 --> 02:35:46.490]  Well, yeah, you, you mentioned exactly what I was going to head toward.
[02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:48.672]  Uh, they want to use this as a calming effect.
[02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:51.473]  Well, I'll tell you what my son was here with his family.
[02:35:52.069 --> 02:35:52.550]  I think so.
[02:36:06.462 --> 02:36:14.467]  I go down to Big Ben once a year when I have time, and I feel so calm and so serene because there's no cell phone, there's not wireless there.
[02:36:14.467 --> 02:36:20.011]  And it's so refreshing, little wired thing they got at the hotel, the website takes like a minute to load, it's so good.
[02:36:20.011 --> 02:36:33.741]  And I just want to lead a revolution against this crap, because we know it's evil, we know it's bad, and I know that I'm diverting my energy even into defending the Second Amendment or any of this, because that's all secondary now, and I'm still going to defend it.
[02:36:34.401 --> 02:36:39.463]  Against the electromagnetic, the GMO, isn't that the big enchilada?
[02:36:39.463 --> 02:36:41.003]  It sure sounds like it.
[02:36:41.003 --> 02:36:42.123]  It sure sounds like it.
[02:36:42.123 --> 02:36:45.324]  And they're herding us there like sheep.
[02:36:45.324 --> 02:36:46.004]  God bless you, Rob.
[02:36:46.004 --> 02:36:46.765]  I'm glad you survived.
[02:36:46.765 --> 02:36:48.245]  You sound like a great patriot.
[02:36:48.245 --> 02:36:49.726]  Great soul.
[02:36:49.726 --> 02:36:50.346]  And I want to be clear.
[02:36:50.346 --> 02:36:53.727]  I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, the First Amendment 110%.
[02:36:53.727 --> 02:37:00.909]  But the First Amendment is more important than the Second because it's what allows you to communicate and warn people.
[02:37:01.957 --> 02:37:02.938]  And to raise the alarm.
[02:37:02.938 --> 02:37:05.739]  I can always get guns, as long as I can raise the alarm.
[02:37:05.739 --> 02:37:08.000]  The Butternut Brigade, as it's known, the ball-peen hammer brigade.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:11.602]  I mean, I can get as many guns as I need, just like Lickety Split.
[02:37:11.602 --> 02:37:13.543]  Because I've got the will to defend my family.
[02:37:13.543 --> 02:37:15.925]  And will is unstoppable with the spirit behind it.
[02:37:15.925 --> 02:37:25.310]  But... Ladies and gentlemen, it's the electromagnetic, it's the TVs, it's the smartphones, it's the screen sickness that I coined that term.
[02:37:26.394 --> 02:37:28.436]  It's the screen sickness.
[02:37:28.436 --> 02:37:32.498]  The globalists are afraid with this audience that I might actually start doing some good.
[02:37:32.498 --> 02:37:39.744]  Because I'll tell you, I've been really retrospective, and we've done maybe 20% of what we could if I really got conscious and focused on this.
[02:37:39.744 --> 02:37:48.170]  And if you do too, and maybe you agree with me, maybe you don't, but I just, I just, my God, the facts are in and we've got to do something.
[02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:48.530]  Don't we?
[02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:51.592]  And then it makes me not even hate David Hogg.
[02:37:51.592 --> 02:37:54.254]  He is a fallen, twisted person they've chosen for this.
[02:37:56.471 --> 02:37:57.572]  Okay, who's up next here?
[02:37:57.572 --> 02:38:02.855]  We've got Alex, we've got Uncle Sam, we've got Debra.
[02:38:02.855 --> 02:38:06.437]  Let's go to Debra in Michigan.
[02:38:06.437 --> 02:38:09.719]  Debra, thanks for holding your awesome.
[02:38:09.719 --> 02:38:10.620]  Hi Alex.
[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:13.142]  Hi.
[02:38:13.142 --> 02:38:16.404]  I have three points I wanted to say.
[02:38:16.404 --> 02:38:24.889]  First, I thought it was really interesting that the Pope said something along Easter, a few years after Obama slamming Easter.
[02:38:28.408 --> 02:38:31.611]  Can you believe that Apple and Google have banned Weister?
[02:38:31.611 --> 02:38:32.431]  They won't promote it.
[02:38:32.431 --> 02:38:33.352]  They won't put it on calendars.
[02:38:33.352 --> 02:38:34.493]  They won't link to it.
[02:38:34.493 --> 02:38:39.057]  They wouldn't even mention it with their thingy called Doodle they put at the top of Google.
[02:38:39.057 --> 02:38:44.201]  I mean, they'll do it for communists and people that support bin Laden, you name it, but not anything Christian, man.
[02:38:44.201 --> 02:38:45.202]  They hate us.
[02:38:45.202 --> 02:38:45.962]  Why is it?
[02:38:45.962 --> 02:38:46.323]  Because the
[02:38:48.004 --> 02:38:55.407]  Because it is, there's not just the evil transmission, there's God's Holy Ghost that is a transmission for us to pick up and fight this.
[02:38:55.407 --> 02:38:57.588]  We have the intel to beat them.
[02:38:57.588 --> 02:38:58.889]  We've been given the intel.
[02:38:58.889 --> 02:38:59.849]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:38:59.849 --> 02:39:03.290]  God wouldn't leave us here and not give us the intel to win this.
[02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:05.191]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:39:05.191 --> 02:39:06.372]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:06.372 --> 02:39:06.472]  100%.
[02:39:06.472 --> 02:39:14.755]  David Hogg reminds me of Lord of the Flies.
[02:39:14.755 --> 02:39:16.176]  He's just out of control.
[02:39:17.941 --> 02:39:24.126]  Even leftists I know, Jonathan Till of the Statesman, said he just comes off as really nasty and evil.
[02:39:24.126 --> 02:39:25.727]  He just, there's something grasping.
[02:39:25.727 --> 02:39:31.552]  I mean, the way he turned and did that fascist salute and clicked his heels, he did it better than a matador could.
[02:39:31.552 --> 02:39:33.313]  It's kind of a ripoff of a matador.
[02:39:33.313 --> 02:39:35.174]  I mean, he did it better than Mussolini or Hitler.
[02:39:35.174 --> 02:39:38.057]  The way he did it, it was like, whoa, that's something.
[02:39:38.057 --> 02:39:40.519]  The power, he was getting off on the people.
[02:39:40.519 --> 02:39:43.921]  He wasn't like streaming back to the people, all of them together with power.
[02:39:43.921 --> 02:39:45.662]  It was all them mindlessly chanting and him
[02:39:46.463 --> 02:39:49.366]  Really, that's what satanic energy is, is not giving back.
[02:39:49.366 --> 02:39:51.669]  He was just sucking off their energy.
[02:39:51.669 --> 02:39:53.191]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:53.191 --> 02:39:54.993]  And his face is always scary.
[02:39:54.993 --> 02:39:56.394]  I've never seen a smile.
[02:39:56.394 --> 02:40:02.081]  I don't like the looks of him in his eyes at all.
[02:40:02.081 --> 02:40:04.984]  Another point I wanted to make, I think, I feel like this
[02:40:06.605 --> 02:40:09.970]  I'm not against poor Hondurans and their horrible form of government.
[02:40:23.288 --> 02:40:27.412]  But yes, Soros, the U.N., funding this group, the U.N.
[02:40:27.412 --> 02:40:31.915]  was based in Honduras running the immigration program under Obama.
[02:40:31.915 --> 02:40:33.196]  Trump pulled us out of that last year.
[02:40:33.196 --> 02:40:33.957]  It was the U.N.
[02:40:33.957 --> 02:40:34.617]  running the vetting.
[02:40:34.617 --> 02:40:37.179]  That's why all these criminals and jihadis were coming in.
[02:40:37.179 --> 02:40:45.046]  And just as an American, I hear there's thousands of people to set the precedent and the legend, just like the Zodiac boats out of North Africa into Italy.
[02:40:45.646 --> 02:40:48.589]  And into Macedonia and into other areas.
[02:40:48.589 --> 02:40:49.069]  Exactly!
[02:40:49.069 --> 02:40:51.752]  They're announcing, we're coming in, we're people without borders.
[02:40:51.752 --> 02:40:53.073]  Well, that's a UN term.
[02:40:53.073 --> 02:40:54.314]  We're coming.
[02:40:54.314 --> 02:40:58.878]  And then Mexico opens the doors up to this when they're normally very brutal to immigrants.
[02:40:58.878 --> 02:41:00.259]  And they're using these people.
[02:41:00.259 --> 02:41:01.881]  But look, water is a wonderful thing.
[02:41:03.069 --> 02:41:04.810]  But if a dam breaks, it'll flood you.
[02:41:04.810 --> 02:41:07.151]  Or if somebody sticks a fire hose down your throat, it'll kill you.
[02:41:07.151 --> 02:41:15.854]  So these immigrants, I don't hate them individually, but they are being used like water to flood us out.
[02:41:15.854 --> 02:41:21.517]  And this whole methodology is being created of hating America and it's racist because the future of America is Hispanic.
[02:41:21.917 --> 02:41:23.899]  Does Hispanics have kids and more power to them?
[02:41:23.899 --> 02:41:28.903]  Then come into the ethos of free market and freedom which you historically, as families, follow.
[02:41:28.903 --> 02:41:32.246]  Pro-family, pro-free market, but you're always under El Jefe.
[02:41:32.246 --> 02:41:35.769]  So break from that and realize the paradigm and don't be followers.
[02:41:37.222 --> 02:41:37.922]  Exactly.
[02:41:37.922 --> 02:41:41.745]  They're expendable and they're being used.
[02:41:41.745 --> 02:41:45.147]  I instinctively want to go to the border because they're going to catch and release them.
[02:41:45.147 --> 02:41:46.067]  Trump didn't get the funding.
[02:41:46.067 --> 02:41:46.687]  He can't get funding.
[02:41:46.687 --> 02:41:48.669]  He's not a dictator from Congress to block it.
[02:41:48.669 --> 02:41:54.512]  And I think Trump should declare an emergency on this with the state government of Texas and Arizona and others.
[02:41:54.512 --> 02:42:01.496]  And they could do state compact agreements with other states, volunteer states, like Tennessee and others that I think we can deploy.
[02:42:03.457 --> 02:42:07.699]  Volunteer people that are licensed sheriff's deputies or police.
[02:42:07.699 --> 02:42:13.401]  And I think a lot of them would be ready to do, you know, two-week, three-week shifts down there to stop this.
[02:42:13.401 --> 02:42:16.262]  Because this is a precedent-setting assault.
[02:42:16.262 --> 02:42:16.882]  Yes.
[02:42:16.882 --> 02:42:17.423]  Yep.
[02:42:17.423 --> 02:42:18.903]  They're pushing the issue.
[02:42:18.903 --> 02:42:21.064]  They're pushing Trump into a corner.
[02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:24.745]  And I think it could very easily be the beginning of our civil war.
[02:42:24.745 --> 02:42:28.867]  Well, that's what they just did this with 10 million Muslims, almost all of military-aged men.
[02:42:28.867 --> 02:42:30.088]  They just did this in Europe.
[02:42:30.088 --> 02:42:31.048]  This is the plan.
[02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:34.301]  This is the assault!
[02:42:34.301 --> 02:42:38.983]  And we've got a president standing up and his approval rating is like 65 in the real world, folks.
[02:42:38.983 --> 02:42:40.763]  That's why the left is so scared.
[02:42:40.763 --> 02:42:41.364]  Trump's at 65.
[02:42:41.364 --> 02:42:44.645]  Notice he keeps going up in the polls.
[02:42:44.645 --> 02:42:45.105]  Up, up, up, up.
[02:42:45.105 --> 02:42:46.125]  Even their fake polls, he's at 50.
[02:42:46.125 --> 02:42:48.807]  Add another 10, 15, 20 points to that.
[02:42:48.807 --> 02:42:50.087]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:42:50.087 --> 02:42:51.448]  We have broken their will.
[02:42:51.448 --> 02:42:52.288]  We just don't know it yet.
[02:42:56.257 --> 02:43:01.740]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:02.580]  I take this.
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:03.721]  My family takes this.
[02:43:03.721 --> 02:43:08.003]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:43:08.003 --> 02:43:12.245]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:43:12.605 --> 02:43:17.248]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:43:17.248 --> 02:43:18.369]  I don't feel good.
[02:43:18.369 --> 02:43:22.132]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:43:22.132 --> 02:43:24.834]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:43:24.834 --> 02:43:30.618]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:43:30.618 --> 02:43:33.580]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:37.122]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:43:37.122 --> 02:43:39.364]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:43:39.364 --> 02:43:39.724]  I love it.
[02:43:39.864 --> 02:43:42.668]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:43:42.668 --> 02:43:43.690]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:49.338]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:49.338 --> 02:43:51.521]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:43:51.521 --> 02:43:53.725]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:43:55.905 --> 02:43:56.706]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:56.706 --> 02:44:06.853]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:06.853 --> 02:44:12.358]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:44:12.358 --> 02:44:15.360]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:24.147]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:26.243 --> 02:44:31.544]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:44:31.544 --> 02:44:34.445]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:34.445 --> 02:44:45.827]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.827 --> 02:44:48.508]  It is amazing!
[02:44:48.508 --> 02:44:53.469]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:44:56.536 --> 02:44:59.338]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:44:59.338 --> 02:45:09.804]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[02:45:09.804 --> 02:45:10.605]  Scalability.
[02:45:10.605 --> 02:45:12.926]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[02:45:12.926 --> 02:45:14.447]  So there's a lot of product and a lot
[02:45:18.510 --> 02:45:18.870]  I don't know.
[02:45:34.169 --> 02:45:39.951]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:45:39.951 --> 02:45:46.392]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[02:45:46.392 --> 02:45:49.213]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[02:45:49.213 --> 02:45:54.755]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.

[02:46:18.455 --> 02:46:20.877]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[02:46:48.314 --> 02:46:50.456]  Something the globalists are targeting.

[02:46:53.238 --> 02:46:55.279]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.286 --> 02:47:12.867]  I'm gonna go right back to your phone calls.
[02:47:12.867 --> 02:47:14.067]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:47:14.067 --> 02:47:16.508]  But look at some of these Drudge Report headlines.
[02:47:16.508 --> 02:47:17.268]  Spring Swing!
[02:47:17.268 --> 02:47:18.589]  Trump 50% approval rating.
[02:47:18.589 --> 02:47:20.729]  Zuckerberg slammed by photojournalist.
[02:47:20.729 --> 02:47:24.331]  Escorted to Facebook HQ for breaching CEO's privacy.
[02:47:24.331 --> 02:47:26.691]  Took pics of him cleaning up dog poo.
[02:47:26.691 --> 02:47:28.812]  Oh, he's really into his privacy.
[02:47:28.812 --> 02:47:30.373]  You don't get into his privacy.
[02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:30.893]  Grindr.
[02:47:30.893 --> 02:47:34.234]  Little sex dating sites.
[02:47:34.234 --> 02:47:37.035]  Sharing HIV status of users with companies.
[02:47:38.292 --> 02:47:42.675]  Oh, you thought you were doing something private there, telling people you had HIV, doing the right thing.
[02:47:42.675 --> 02:47:46.257]  They're just going to share that with insurance companies.
[02:47:46.257 --> 02:47:49.179]  Roseanne ratings go from 18 million to 25 million.
[02:47:49.179 --> 02:47:51.500]  There's no other show that even had that in five years.
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:55.002]  Because they just want it fair, not one message of brainwashing.
[02:47:57.728 --> 02:48:05.774]  Winnie Mandela, the woman that called for and did kill thousands of black people under orders, hundreds, reportedly in part of raids she was part of.
[02:48:05.774 --> 02:48:09.257]  They would hang them around other, mainly Zulus' necks and burn them to death.
[02:48:09.257 --> 02:48:10.218]  But that's liberal.
[02:48:10.218 --> 02:48:12.139]  That's beautiful when she does that.
[02:48:12.139 --> 02:48:14.541]  She's deader than a box of rocks.
[02:48:22.008 --> 02:48:23.568]  We're going to go back to your phone calls now.
[02:48:23.568 --> 02:48:24.509]  It's just amazing.
[02:48:24.509 --> 02:48:35.011]  We have a president warning of a caravan mass invasion from Central and South America, coordinated by the UN, who has already coordinated the caravans before.
[02:48:35.011 --> 02:48:39.232]  Mexico would tell the people, you stay on the train and on this corridor or you go to jail.
[02:48:39.232 --> 02:48:43.453]  It's before you get six months to a year in prison for coming to Mexico illegally.
[02:48:43.453 --> 02:48:45.214]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:45.214 --> 02:48:47.154]  All right, who's up next here?
[02:48:47.154 --> 02:48:49.675]  Let's talk to Pastor Sam in the great state of Texas.
[02:48:49.675 --> 02:48:50.695]  Pastor Sam, you're on the air.
[02:48:50.695 --> 02:48:50.955]  Go ahead.
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:56.921]  I'm sorry, your phone's breaking up.
[02:48:56.921 --> 02:48:58.321]  Try to talk right in it.
[02:48:58.321 --> 02:48:58.982]  Got you right here.
[02:48:58.982 --> 02:49:00.723]  Go ahead.
[02:49:00.723 --> 02:49:04.705]  A great teaching on the One World Religion, Alex, you're right on.
[02:49:04.705 --> 02:49:18.692]  I just got a copy of Dr. Jerome Corsi's new book, Killing the Deep State, where he talks about the CIA drug pandering and its connection to the One World Religion.
[02:49:18.692 --> 02:49:21.254]  Got to talk right in your phone.
[02:49:21.254 --> 02:49:21.574]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:23.788 --> 02:49:41.609]  I've lost my quote from that, but he tells about the CIA running drugs and HSBC Bank laundering the proceeds from the heroin and the Vietnam War, and how then that went on Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and then finally Afghanistan.
[02:49:42.239 --> 02:49:56.665]  And I don't know if you know, you're pretty informed, Alex, but Milton Bieren has moved to Austin, and he's the biggest crocodile in the swamp, and the architect of the modern Deep State, as told in the movie and book, Charlie Wilson's War.
[02:49:56.665 --> 02:50:01.708]  He's the one that set up the whole CIA military operation there in Afghanistan.
[02:50:01.708 --> 02:50:04.209]  Did you know you had him for a new neighbor?
[02:50:04.209 --> 02:50:05.029]  I did know that.
[02:50:05.029 --> 02:50:06.710]  You know, I one time went to a swim meet,
[02:50:07.901 --> 02:50:13.764]  And I realized after I met the people who they were, it was Charlie Wilson's right-hand guy and all them.
[02:50:13.764 --> 02:50:15.025]  And it was something else.
[02:50:15.025 --> 02:50:17.406]  But I had a little funny conversation with those guys.
[02:50:17.406 --> 02:50:19.427]  But yeah, no, you can't swing a stick around here.
[02:50:19.427 --> 02:50:24.470]  And I'm not defending the CIA, but it kind of lessens it.
[02:50:24.470 --> 02:50:34.175]  It's criminal globalist elements within the CIA using the National Security Act in secrecy and using the compartmentalization to carry out their criminal operations.
[02:50:34.175 --> 02:50:36.997]  And so much of the resistance against the globalists with Trump
[02:50:37.799 --> 02:50:40.860]  Has now been carried out through the CIA because it's just a vehicle.
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:46.682]  It's like, Trump, they gave all this unconstitutional power to the President for Obama to sell us out.
[02:50:46.682 --> 02:50:49.543]  Well, Trump just used that to kill TPP and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:50:49.543 --> 02:50:50.703]  That's why they're so upset right now.
[02:50:50.703 --> 02:50:52.604]  Does that make sense?
[02:50:52.604 --> 02:50:53.664]  Absolutely.
[02:50:53.664 --> 02:50:57.425]  Milton Beard is my personal associate and enemy.
[02:50:57.425 --> 02:51:02.107]  And his second wife, French-born Marie Catherine, teaches at UT in Austin.
[02:51:02.697 --> 02:51:17.472]  So, if anyone would wonder why there's such Islamophilia and Antifa in Austin, perhaps it's because the greatest of the deep state Islamophiles has moved there, perhaps to retire in sunny Texas.
[02:51:17.472 --> 02:51:18.432]  Good luck for that.
[02:51:18.432 --> 02:51:19.634]  Alright, we appreciate you.
[02:51:21.479 --> 02:51:30.268]  There's not a lot of Texans left in this state, but for every real Texan, we can outnumber them by one Texan equals about 100 of the globalists, so we'll see how that all works out.
[02:51:30.268 --> 02:51:32.230]  Pastor Sam's funny.
[02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:35.133]  Who's up next here?
[02:51:35.133 --> 02:51:42.821]  Jason in Florida wants to talk about the big leftist, you know, free-for-all, underground thing, DMT, that the government
[02:51:43.632 --> 02:51:44.052]  What's up Alex?
[02:51:44.052 --> 02:51:44.733]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:51:44.733 --> 02:51:45.433]  I love what you do.
[02:51:45.433 --> 02:51:48.176]  I did DMT like a year ago and I think it brought me closer to God.
[02:52:06.246 --> 02:52:09.649]  That's because I'm just a positive person and I believe in God, Jesus Christ.
[02:52:09.649 --> 02:52:17.515]  Well, I was about to say, and I don't want to encourage drug use, but people that already believe in Christ and are good people and everything, generally they have a really good experience.
[02:52:17.515 --> 02:52:25.161]  It's just that people that didn't believe in God already, they instantly, the spirit guides show up and it's like, and it leads down a really bad path.
[02:52:25.161 --> 02:52:26.462]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[02:52:26.462 --> 02:52:34.188]  I think that these people are already programmed selfishly and with just an inborn
[02:52:34.821 --> 02:52:39.385]  That's sort of craziness that they receive those transmissions from the dark side.
[02:52:39.385 --> 02:52:40.426]  Let me ask you this.
[02:52:40.426 --> 02:52:47.473]  What happened when you took DMT, which is the same chemical, for those that don't know, your brain releases on death and at the very deepest levels of sleep.
[02:52:47.473 --> 02:52:48.754]  So I just enjoy my sleep.
[02:52:48.754 --> 02:52:49.635]  I control my dreams.
[02:52:49.635 --> 02:52:52.517]  I have huge adventures every night and everything else.
[02:52:52.517 --> 02:52:55.920]  It is the higher dimensions and it's all plugged in.
[02:52:55.920 --> 02:52:56.601]  It's the internet.
[02:52:56.601 --> 02:52:58.283]  So when I'm asleep for eight hours at night, I'm, you know...
[02:52:58.903 --> 02:53:06.070]  Well, I took a large dose the very first time and broke through and it was just all I can describe it as would be like a kaleidoscope of every color you could imagine just all
[02:53:23.675 --> 02:53:26.517]  Sort of coming together in just beautiful patterns.
[02:53:26.517 --> 02:53:35.802]  And then I did see entities and they were basically communicating with me that I had been there before and that they were happy that I was back.
[02:53:35.802 --> 02:53:41.906]  And after, I don't know, what seemed to be a couple of minutes, I started to feel my body.
[02:53:41.906 --> 02:53:51.231]  I couldn't see or feel my body, but I had a sense that I was like really like stiffening up with anxiety because I wasn't sure what was going on and couldn't remember why I was there.
[02:53:51.849 --> 02:54:14.811]  And I was basically just approached by a what just all I could describe was like an Egyptian goddess made of light with about 50 arms and she opened her arms and put it under my chin and got really close to my face and just communicated with me that everything was going to be okay and to just you know
[02:54:16.031 --> 02:54:16.892]  It's fine.
[02:54:16.892 --> 02:54:18.113]  You know, you ride it out.
[02:54:18.113 --> 02:54:27.218]  And basically that just like completely calmed me and I was able to sort of, you know... Yeah, well that's what the angels described an angel looking like.
[02:54:27.218 --> 02:54:28.219]  Now, that's an angel.
[02:54:28.219 --> 02:54:33.042]  Can you imagine people that are... It's a room full of demons?
[02:54:33.042 --> 02:54:41.447]  Well, that's the thing too is on my third trip, I went into it with... It's all about... It's similar with psychedelics about your mindset.
[02:54:41.447 --> 02:54:44.229]  And the third trip I went into it and I was listening to like
[02:54:44.778 --> 02:54:52.860]  Some really hardcore metal that day, you know, nothing super dark, but, but it was a little, it was more dark.
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:55.141]  And it's all about how you go into it.
[02:54:55.141 --> 02:54:58.422]  And it's really like, it's, it's really touching.
[02:54:58.422 --> 02:55:02.103]  You're saying it's what, it's what dimension you're resonating with.
[02:55:02.103 --> 02:55:02.683]  Exactly.
[02:55:02.683 --> 02:55:11.325]  And like when the third time I went into it, you know, I didn't, I didn't really concentrate on like getting into a good, you know, you know, sort of, sort of,
[02:55:12.046 --> 02:55:12.326]  All right.
[02:55:34.959 --> 02:55:35.640]  Alex, one more question?
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:37.621]  Why can't we get like a
[02:56:03.942 --> 02:56:07.466]  Special military unit of guys that are awake.
[02:56:07.466 --> 02:56:11.271]  I'm sure our guy Zach knows about guys like that.
[02:56:11.271 --> 02:56:13.393]  And my brother was one of those guys, special forces guy.
[02:56:13.393 --> 02:56:21.002]  Why can't we get a group of guys, you know, some sort of a battalion and just take out the globalists, take out the top of the pyramid.
[02:56:21.002 --> 02:56:23.384]  Here's the thing, everything's already surveilled.
[02:56:24.201 --> 02:56:31.642]  And so, and there's people in, mixed into everything, and it's not like you can't just do something at the top physically.
[02:56:31.642 --> 02:56:33.423]  It's spiritual for everybody.
[02:56:33.423 --> 02:56:40.444]  So the fight is all of us individually communicating with each other and recognizing what this is, and then its power will fall away.
[02:56:40.444 --> 02:56:42.724]  Like flesh rotting off bones.
[02:56:42.724 --> 02:56:44.144]  There are guys at the top.
[02:56:44.144 --> 02:56:50.125]  I know, but if we weren't under their control, if we weren't following them, if we weren't weak, myself included, they would have no power.
[02:56:50.125 --> 02:56:51.266]  You understand?
[02:56:51.266 --> 02:56:53.606]  Well, this is coming from somewhere, and they're human.
[02:56:54.580 --> 02:57:02.644]  Okay, if we destroy them, if the good men and women of this world stand up and fight them and destroy them, then they're done.
[02:57:02.644 --> 02:57:08.587]  And it would be an example for the whole world and the whole universe to see that we're not going to put up with these people.
[02:57:08.587 --> 02:57:12.028]  And you want to rob humanity blind?
[02:57:12.028 --> 02:57:13.369]  You want to arrest development?
[02:57:13.369 --> 02:57:14.149]  You die.
[02:57:14.149 --> 02:57:15.190]  That's it.
[02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.710]  It's over.
[02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.930]  You don't...
[02:57:19.008 --> 02:57:21.770]  I'm not putting you down, I'm not saying you're wrong.
[02:57:21.770 --> 02:57:26.072]  This whole thing about physically, there are evil globalist positions of power everywhere.
[02:57:26.072 --> 02:57:30.815]  And then they've got ten levels deep of minions, even worse, ready to take your place.
[02:57:30.815 --> 02:57:33.797]  And so it's like shark teeth, we have to change ourselves.
[02:57:33.797 --> 02:57:35.217]  It's an inside job.
[02:57:35.217 --> 02:57:37.859]  That's what we have to do with our choices and what we do.
[02:57:37.859 --> 02:57:38.899]  I appreciate your call, Jason.
[02:57:38.899 --> 02:57:39.820]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:57:39.820 --> 02:57:41.701]  And then it's Salente hosting.
[02:57:41.701 --> 02:57:43.022]  Salente, then Bracken's coming up.
[02:57:45.071 --> 02:57:48.675]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.675 --> 02:57:50.438]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.438 --> 02:58:01.711]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.592 --> 02:58:11.662]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.662 --> 02:58:22.234]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.714 --> 02:58:25.337]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.337 --> 02:58:27.059]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.059 --> 02:58:37.070]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:39.712]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.712 --> 02:58:44.418]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:58:46.308 --> 02:58:51.852]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[02:58:51.852 --> 02:58:52.773]  They take hours.
[02:58:52.773 --> 02:58:55.215]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.215 --> 02:58:56.396]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.396 --> 02:58:57.997]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:57.997 --> 02:59:01.220]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.220 --> 02:59:02.341]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.341 --> 02:59:05.523]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.523 --> 02:59:08.846]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.286 --> 02:59:09.426]  Yeah.
[02:59:25.925 --> 02:59:28.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:59.565 --> 03:00:03.648]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:03.648 --> 03:00:08.972]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.972 --> 03:00:11.254]  Forrest!
[03:00:11.254 --> 03:00:12.975]  That was my uncle's first name.
[03:00:12.975 --> 03:00:14.316]  He went by Biff.
[03:00:14.316 --> 03:00:15.557]  Forrest in Texas.
[03:00:15.557 --> 03:00:18.779]  Let's talk about Compromise Defense Intelligence Network.
[03:00:18.779 --> 03:00:19.340]  You're on the air.
[03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:19.640]  Go ahead.
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:27.829]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that most of our corporations are completely compromised or they don't even have to take an oath to the Constitution.
[03:00:27.829 --> 03:00:33.235]  These people are more loyal to that dollar and that shareholder than they are to the nation.
[03:00:33.235 --> 03:00:33.656]  What do you think?
[03:00:34.588 --> 03:00:45.755]  Absolutely, and the Communist Chinese have been allowed control of the infrastructure, the telecommunications, all the grids that coordinate all the phone systems, the Panama Canal, the deepwater ports.
[03:00:45.755 --> 03:00:49.397]  I mean, I just hope Trump hadn't shown up a day late and a dollar short.
[03:00:49.397 --> 03:00:54.220]  Americans in mass should be behind him, removing the globalists, removing it all.
[03:00:54.220 --> 03:01:02.085]  This is insane that the globalist left, allied with Communist China, has totally screwed this country over, and the Democrats are protesting Trump.
[03:01:03.065 --> 03:01:10.033]  Uh, trying to just, when China steals $500 billion a year from us, a $50 billion tariff telling them to just be more reasonable.
[03:01:10.033 --> 03:01:11.014]  They're like, no.
[03:01:11.014 --> 03:01:12.196]  And then I didn't even get to this.
[03:01:12.196 --> 03:01:13.157]  It's in the news today.
[03:01:13.157 --> 03:01:15.499]  Like, I'll come back in the next segment.
[03:01:15.499 --> 03:01:16.100]  I have to cover it.
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:18.943]  And China is like, maximize spy attacks!
[03:01:18.943 --> 03:01:20.365]  Steal everything the US has got!
[03:01:21.527 --> 03:01:38.052]  Well, they've always been doing that, but now they're publicly declared war on us, and it's those arrogant communists to look at those guys that our own CIA put in power in 49 makes me sick that the left turned China over to these pieces of crap.
[03:01:38.052 --> 03:01:40.253]  Yeah, it's also another complex.
[03:01:40.253 --> 03:01:41.473]  I'd like to add to it.
[03:01:41.473 --> 03:01:44.674]  I mean, how long do you want to wait before Jeff Sessions actually does something?
[03:01:44.674 --> 03:01:46.455]  I mean, are we going to wait 30 years until
[03:01:46.994 --> 03:01:48.695]  You know, I mean, I want to clarify this.
[03:01:48.695 --> 03:01:54.919]  Hillary Clinton is basically senile and insane and has, you know, some symptoms if you look at the picture of her tongue.
[03:01:54.919 --> 03:01:58.842]  Yeah, we can't even beat a senile drug addict.
[03:01:58.842 --> 03:02:04.285]  Yeah, I mean, it's not only that, but the majority of the deep state, you were talking about activation.
[03:02:04.285 --> 03:02:07.667]  You said something about 10 layers deep to the last collar.
[03:02:07.667 --> 03:02:10.849]  Well, the thing is, is, you know, we could we could take the fruit.
[03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:14.312]  We could, you know, you know, chop off the branch, you know, even cut it at its trunk.
[03:02:14.312 --> 03:02:15.392]  But the roots still lay there.
[03:02:15.392 --> 03:02:16.413]  I guess that's your argument.
[03:02:16.840 --> 03:02:19.261]  But if we don't do nothing, we're already doomed.
[03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:22.183]  I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm not pretty sure.
[03:02:22.183 --> 03:02:25.465]  I think they're waiting to completely conquer us.
[03:02:25.465 --> 03:02:29.627]  And maybe this is some sort of asset like our country's already been sold.
[03:02:30.231 --> 03:02:42.579]  And we're already in debt, and China's just making sure that... You know, I've thought Trump may not even know it, that he's a rearguard action just to make sure that the consolidation, that the globalists get paid what they were supposed to, selling us out the Chinese.
[03:02:42.579 --> 03:02:46.221]  In fact, more and more I think that's what it is, and the President doesn't even realize that.
[03:02:46.221 --> 03:02:52.445]  The way this is going, and the way they let him go so far but not, is that he's just there to broker that they all get their money for the sellout.
[03:02:52.445 --> 03:02:54.507]  Is that what you think?
[03:02:54.507 --> 03:02:56.248]  We have two steel factories, that's it.
[03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:58.411]  And I just want to clarify this even more.
[03:02:58.411 --> 03:03:01.493]  The majority of Chinese steel is the lowest quality steel ever.
[03:03:01.493 --> 03:03:05.936]  There are buildings out there that in other countries would not even be allowed.
[03:03:05.936 --> 03:03:08.037]  Oh yeah, we should be rejecting it on the dock.
[03:03:09.361 --> 03:03:15.025]  And not just that, but this globalism, the Libertarian Party has been completely conquered.
[03:03:15.025 --> 03:03:17.066]  The Republicans have been semi-conquered.
[03:03:17.066 --> 03:03:17.527]  No, I agree.
[03:03:17.527 --> 03:03:19.088]  Most people will do it for the money, brother.
[03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.789]  And then if you don't take the money, they come after you.
[03:03:20.789 --> 03:03:21.949]  So, look, I hear you.
[03:03:21.949 --> 03:03:24.111]  They've been pushing, they've been pushing, they've been doing things.
[03:03:24.111 --> 03:03:27.253]  And, you know, individuals have to do what individuals are going to do.
[03:03:27.253 --> 03:03:31.236]  And we know these false flags are always targeting innocent groups of people.
[03:03:31.236 --> 03:03:32.737]  But I know this.
[03:03:32.737 --> 03:03:34.038]  The globalists go much further.
[03:03:34.038 --> 03:03:35.999]  I can just look at the tea leaves.
[03:03:35.999 --> 03:03:38.901]  And that's why they've already, listen, brother, they've already gone to New Zealand.
[03:03:39.761 --> 03:03:41.481]  They've already gone to Kauai.
[03:03:41.481 --> 03:03:45.542]  The globalists are already scared in armed camps with airports a mile away.
[03:03:45.542 --> 03:03:46.742]  They already know.
[03:03:46.742 --> 03:03:48.323]  They already know, man.
[03:03:48.323 --> 03:03:54.004]  And so, I'm just telling you that, are you going to go become a coffee farmer in Kauai?
[03:03:54.004 --> 03:03:59.504]  Because, you know, I mean, people sit here and talk about what people are going to do.
[03:03:59.504 --> 03:04:01.405]  You thought that stuff through.
[03:04:01.405 --> 03:04:03.425]  You know, you want to grow some crops of your own.
[03:04:03.425 --> 03:04:08.026]  You got to get there and till the soil and prepare the soil and plant your seeds and
[03:04:08.919 --> 03:04:10.020]  Wait till the sun comes up.
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:11.200]  So, I think they already know.
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:12.061]  They already know.
[03:04:12.061 --> 03:04:15.323]  They already know that people are ready to start killing them.
[03:04:15.323 --> 03:04:18.485]  I just don't, I don't think that's the way to go at this point.
[03:04:18.485 --> 03:04:26.110]  I really think we need to fight them in the info war, because the idea of, well, they come for my guns, I'll fight back, or, oh, we're going to get them physically someday, is almost like a cop-out.
[03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:29.091]  You have to engage them in information war now.
[03:04:29.091 --> 03:04:30.032]  Now, now.
[03:04:30.032 --> 03:04:32.133]  Now, the season of blood comes, let it rain.
[03:04:32.133 --> 03:04:34.275]  If that's what they want, they will get it.
[03:04:35.055 --> 03:04:38.179]  But I'm just telling you right now, they're already soulless, so it doesn't matter.
[03:04:38.179 --> 03:04:43.145]  You hack one head off, the spirit, like, came out of the possessed man into the pigs.
[03:04:43.145 --> 03:04:44.967]  It'll just race into the next zombie.
[03:04:44.967 --> 03:04:48.972]  They have an unlimited army of husk, ready to be avatared right now.
[03:04:54.229 --> 03:04:57.991]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:04:57.991 --> 03:05:05.035]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:05:05.035 --> 03:05:09.798]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:05:09.798 --> 03:05:10.538]  It's very simple.
[03:05:10.538 --> 03:05:13.040]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:14.981]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:05:14.981 --> 03:05:16.902]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:05:16.902 --> 03:05:17.963]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:05:17.963 --> 03:05:18.703]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:05:23.646 --> 03:05:26.848]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:05:26.848 --> 03:05:31.131]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:05:31.131 --> 03:05:34.974]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:05:34.974 --> 03:05:38.836]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:05:38.836 --> 03:05:41.998]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:05:41.998 --> 03:05:45.641]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:05:45.641 --> 03:05:48.242]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:05:48.242 --> 03:05:49.263]  It's amazing.
[03:05:49.263 --> 03:05:51.845]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:06:06.711 --> 03:06:09.312]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:09.312 --> 03:06:10.852]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.852 --> 03:06:14.614]  All right, Gerald Cilenti is taking over in like two minutes.
[03:06:14.614 --> 03:06:15.854]  I did not plug last hour.
[03:06:15.854 --> 03:06:18.175]  I need to plug, because you know the globalists are after us.
[03:06:19.420 --> 03:06:20.581]  Plus, we've got really great products.
[03:06:20.581 --> 03:06:28.649]  It's like our information is cutting edge, and it's got the whole globalist combine upset, because we're just telling you really what's going on, from their own words.
[03:06:28.649 --> 03:06:29.670]  We have great products.
[03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:33.274]  And bodies... We need to cut a new egg, because we have a new bottle.
[03:06:33.274 --> 03:06:34.215]  I said, why is the bottle red?
[03:06:34.215 --> 03:06:34.856]  Turmeric's orange.
[03:06:35.970 --> 03:06:48.339]  The average tumeric product out there is about 50 milligrams and it's 3% of the curcumin, as they call it, or the chemical that's in the tumeric that's so anti-inflammatory, so good for the cells.
[03:06:48.339 --> 03:06:51.301]  We can't even get into all the claims because they'll come after us, but everybody knows about tumeric.
[03:06:52.406 --> 03:06:55.289]  We believe this is the strongest turmeric on the market.
[03:06:55.289 --> 03:06:59.693]  The companies that produce it, that have tested it, they said it's definitely the strongest they've ever put out.
[03:06:59.693 --> 03:07:04.938]  95% curcumin in rating, and then it's got a bunch of other compounds that supercharge it.
[03:07:04.938 --> 03:07:10.163]  It is a multi-month supply, and it is a big old bottle of it.
[03:07:10.163 --> 03:07:13.386]  120 capsules, let's take one a day.
[03:07:13.386 --> 03:07:14.727]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 25% off.
[03:07:16.581 --> 03:07:17.962]  We've got to end this special very soon.
[03:07:17.962 --> 03:07:20.124]  BrainForce Plus, an amazing nootropic.
[03:07:20.124 --> 03:07:22.966]  It is about to sell out, but more is coming in a few weeks.
[03:07:22.966 --> 03:07:24.908]  We're going to have to end that 50% off.
[03:07:24.908 --> 03:07:29.351]  We've got CellForce 50% off, which is going to be called DNAForce Plus, because it's even stronger.
[03:07:29.351 --> 03:07:30.932]  That's about to sell out.
[03:07:30.932 --> 03:07:34.876]  We've got so much there at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:34.876 --> 03:07:36.217]  And we have the Real Red Pill Challenge.
[03:07:36.217 --> 03:07:41.061]  You can get it with free shipping and 50% off when you get it with BrainForce, because BrainForce kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:07:42.182 --> 03:07:44.183]  The Real Red Pill takes about four or five days.
[03:07:44.183 --> 03:07:45.805]  I just say take the seven day challenge.
[03:07:45.805 --> 03:07:48.387]  Because everybody I know in the reviews say, oh Alex is right.
[03:07:48.387 --> 03:07:52.011]  Five, six, seven days later, take a few capsules of this a day.
[03:07:52.011 --> 03:07:58.076]  It's got the right amino acids, the right minerals, the right vitamins, but then it's got the preglanone, which is a steroid!
[03:07:58.897 --> 03:08:00.579]  But it's over-the-counter.
[03:08:00.579 --> 03:08:04.824]  It's the precursor that your body naturally produces that it makes everything else out of.
[03:08:04.824 --> 03:08:08.387]  With all the chemicals and stuff in our diet, after about 25, it goes way down.
[03:08:08.387 --> 03:08:10.109]  Studies say it didn't used to be like that.
[03:08:10.109 --> 03:08:14.214]  And so, you can't even make the hormones without the preglanone.
[03:08:14.214 --> 03:08:15.996]  But it's got everything in it that helps you upload it.
[03:08:15.996 --> 03:08:18.418]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:21.050 --> 03:08:23.071]  Or AAA-253-3139.
[03:08:23.071 --> 03:08:26.674]  And again, you make it all possible in newswars.com, infowars.com.
[03:08:26.674 --> 03:08:28.896]  A lot of incredible reports breaking up there right now.
[03:08:28.896 --> 03:08:31.598]  My son wanted to do a report on the cell phones.
[03:08:31.598 --> 03:08:32.319]  He did one.
[03:08:32.319 --> 03:08:33.280]  That's up there.
[03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:34.040]  Big studies out.
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:36.943]  Cell phones kill more people than cigarettes.
[03:08:36.943 --> 03:08:38.364]  So a lot is coming out.
[03:08:38.364 --> 03:08:39.565]  A lot is going on.
[03:08:39.565 --> 03:08:41.847]  And Gerald Cilente is taking over.
[03:08:41.847 --> 03:08:44.209]  Gerald, what do you got coming up today?
[03:08:44.209 --> 03:08:46.831]  Let's stay right with the cell phones.
[03:08:46.831 --> 03:08:48.692]  That was one of our top trends for 2016.
[03:08:50.325 --> 03:08:52.766]  Clean phones.
[03:08:52.766 --> 03:08:54.127]  You're 100% right.
[03:08:54.127 --> 03:08:56.928]  People don't realize how deadly they are.
[03:08:56.928 --> 03:09:05.052]  I started working with the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association back in the 90s.
[03:09:05.052 --> 03:09:06.852]  I did research for them.
[03:09:06.852 --> 03:09:11.554]  And that's the days when people used to have these big things in their trunk with the aerial.
[03:09:11.554 --> 03:09:14.796]  And I started following the research continually since then.
[03:09:15.456 --> 03:09:22.381]  And study after study comes out, and study after study keeps being pushed down and hidden.
[03:09:22.381 --> 03:09:33.508]  Just like, remember those murderers from the tobacco industry telling Congress in the 1990s, oh no, no, this stuff doesn't kill you, it's good for you.
[03:09:33.508 --> 03:09:34.328]  Yeah, remember that?
[03:09:34.328 --> 03:09:37.150]  They're doing the same thing with cell phones.
[03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:41.833]  I don't carry one, I only have one when I travel, so I can tell the call where I'm at
[03:09:42.573 --> 03:09:45.314]  Exactly, it's a very limited, dangerous computer.
[03:09:45.314 --> 03:09:50.156]  And so let me ask you this, you picked up, I don't know if you were listening the first hour, but that's what I asked.
[03:09:50.156 --> 03:09:56.979]  Every article I've seen since 1988 when I first read it in USA Today, and I can go look at the studies going back to the 70s as you said,
[03:09:57.779 --> 03:09:59.480]  Can cell phones cause cancer?
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:08.283]  And then you read the CBS article that goes, conclusively, major top researchers found that it's causing brain tumors, heart tumors, you name it.
[03:10:08.283 --> 03:10:15.446]  That's exactly what we already knew, but they always say, oh, we just discovered it, so when you get a brain tumor, you don't get mad no matter what year it is.
[03:10:15.446 --> 03:10:17.006]  You think they didn't know.
[03:10:17.006 --> 03:10:23.509]  And I wonder how they get CBS and all of them, just like they have this new Sinclair video out where it shows 100 reporters all saying the exact same thing.
[03:10:23.509 --> 03:10:26.090]  They put a talking point out, and even the reporter doesn't know,
[03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:28.731]  Why is it always they just found out?
[03:10:28.731 --> 03:10:37.717]  I think it's so when you get the brain tumor, or the bone cancer, or the tongue cancer, or whatever you get from this, you go, oh, well, that's okay, they just found out.
[03:10:37.717 --> 03:10:40.779]  But they knew at the original studies what was happening.
[03:10:40.779 --> 03:10:43.141]  Again, go back to the cigarette industry.
[03:10:43.141 --> 03:10:49.105]  You remember when the presidents of the companies was testifying before Congress, saying there was no proof.
[03:10:49.105 --> 03:10:49.905]  And that's like 1998 or something.
[03:10:51.596 --> 03:10:58.720]  So they know, and the reasons why you hear all the propaganda coming out is because they're prostitutes.
[03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:00.141]  They get paid to put out.
[03:11:00.141 --> 03:11:02.742]  They get paid to say what they're getting paid to say.
[03:11:02.742 --> 03:11:05.064]  And why isn't Congress doing anything?
[03:11:05.064 --> 03:11:07.485]  As I keep saying, only people that have
[03:11:07.845 --> 03:11:08.606]  We're good to go.
[03:11:23.357 --> 03:11:27.821]  The gum cigars and the gum cigarettes and you know they're trying to get us habituated.
[03:11:27.821 --> 03:11:32.065]  Turned out the tobacco companies own subsidiaries pushing that.
[03:11:32.065 --> 03:11:39.752]  This electromagnetic radiation and all the studies hurts fast-growing cells of children even more because it causes fast-growing cells to mutate.
[03:11:39.752 --> 03:11:42.194]  Everybody knows radiation hurts children more you name it.
[03:11:43.135 --> 03:11:49.378]  Where are the groups saying don't advertise cell phones to children when we know in studies they kill more people than cigarettes?
[03:11:49.378 --> 03:11:51.618]  Steve Jobs wouldn't have wireless in his home.
[03:11:51.618 --> 03:11:52.979]  Bill Gates won't have wireless.
[03:11:52.979 --> 03:11:55.200]  They wouldn't let their kids have iPhones or iPads.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:56.440]  Gerald Solente, take it over.
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:11:58.181]  Oh, I get it.
[03:11:58.181 --> 03:11:59.382]  You got it.
[03:11:59.382 --> 03:12:00.962]  We don't have wireless here either.
[03:12:00.962 --> 03:12:02.303]  I won't allow it.
[03:12:02.303 --> 03:12:05.284]  And with children's brains, they're much thinner.
[03:12:05.284 --> 03:12:09.766]  So now these little kids are getting addicted to these things at a very young age.
[03:12:09.766 --> 03:12:12.667]  And the point is going to become when people say,
[03:12:13.442 --> 03:12:15.645]  You know, this is like cigarette smoking.
[03:12:15.645 --> 03:12:16.826]  It's killing me.
[03:12:16.826 --> 03:12:20.511]  But they're addicted to it just like they are with cigarettes.
[03:12:20.511 --> 03:12:28.081]  When my friends and business people come over here, there's no cell phone talk allowed as we're doing business or having a good time.
[03:12:28.081 --> 03:12:28.842]  They don't allow it.
[03:12:29.563 --> 03:12:31.343]  So anyway... That's what I've told my children.
[03:12:31.343 --> 03:12:33.864]  I let them have it when they're Ubering or going to a friend's house.
[03:12:33.864 --> 03:12:35.084]  And I say, this is a weapon.
[03:12:35.084 --> 03:12:36.424]  It's like cigarettes.
[03:12:36.424 --> 03:12:37.645]  Don't wear it on your body.
[03:12:37.645 --> 03:12:38.745]  Put it in a purse.
[03:12:38.745 --> 03:12:39.805]  I give them blocket pockets.
[03:12:39.805 --> 03:12:40.225]  Keep it away.
[03:12:40.225 --> 03:12:41.025]  They're like, oh, dad.
[03:12:41.025 --> 03:12:42.506]  I keep showing them the articles.
[03:12:42.506 --> 03:12:44.526]  Now some of their other friends' parents are telling them the same thing.
[03:12:44.526 --> 03:12:47.507]  Not from me, but separately, parents are starting to get this.
[03:12:47.507 --> 03:12:50.707]  And yes, it's a useful tool, but it's very dangerous, like a firearm.
[03:12:50.707 --> 03:12:52.868]  And you've got to understand how dangerous it is.
[03:12:52.868 --> 03:12:54.848]  And it kills more people than firearms ever have.
[03:12:56.104 --> 03:12:58.646]  Well, again, you know, they call them smart phones.
[03:12:58.646 --> 03:12:59.827]  Everybody's getting dumber.
[03:12:59.827 --> 03:13:01.969]  They're so addicted to these things.
[03:13:01.969 --> 03:13:04.371]  And again, that's one of our top trends.
[03:13:04.371 --> 03:13:06.253]  Clean phones.
[03:13:06.253 --> 03:13:13.399]  The company that comes out with a phone that diminishes or eliminates this kind of risk is, again,
[03:13:14.019 --> 03:13:14.880]  That's gonna be the one.
[03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:21.947]  I was about to say, it needs to be a super compressed encoded radio transmission that is literally one one thousandth of the current cell phones.
[03:13:21.947 --> 03:13:22.608]  I've looked at the numbers.
[03:13:22.608 --> 03:13:23.529]  I was already thinking of this.
[03:13:23.529 --> 03:13:23.930]  Funny you say this.
[03:13:23.930 --> 03:13:24.750]  I've been thinking of this too.
[03:13:24.750 --> 03:13:25.912]  Of course, I read your journal.
[03:13:25.912 --> 03:13:33.840]  That then sends a radio encoded transmission to another tower so you're not at point-blank range and then and then you communicate over that.
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:36.483]  That is, that will be the next big mega industry.
[03:13:37.558 --> 03:13:45.283]  That's if we let it happen, but when you look at the 5G industry that's coming... Instead they're getting more powerful, exactly.
[03:13:45.283 --> 03:13:45.583]  Yeah.
[03:13:45.583 --> 03:13:48.665]  It should be getting lower radiation with the compression.
[03:13:48.665 --> 03:13:57.230]  And then there should be laws, exactly, and not, oh unlimited, I want to move in a neighborhood that has 10G in it, where I can download five movies a second.
[03:13:57.230 --> 03:14:00.092]  You don't need to do that and it's cooking your freaking testicles!
[03:14:01.823 --> 03:14:05.586]  Hey, by the way, that's why they call these things handhelds.
[03:14:05.586 --> 03:14:08.288]  Because people are masturbating in public with them.
[03:14:08.288 --> 03:14:10.309]  They're not communicating anymore.
[03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:13.391]  They're so attached to their handheld.
[03:14:13.391 --> 03:14:15.073]  So they're not smartphones.
[03:14:15.073 --> 03:14:22.158]  It's showing young men and even young girls are now romantically inclined to their cell phone and now want a robot instead of a person.
[03:14:23.018 --> 03:14:23.678]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.678 --> 03:14:26.779]  So the whole thing is, again, we've taken over by the geeks.
[03:14:26.779 --> 03:14:28.180]  Look at their lifestyle.
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:30.120]  Don't they dress wonderfully?
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:32.201]  Don't they have a lot of class?
[03:14:32.201 --> 03:14:34.062]  You couldn't get a lower class.
[03:14:34.062 --> 03:14:41.264]  And we, now they have infused the geek mind, the geek style into general society.
[03:14:41.264 --> 03:14:43.265]  We're following the worst of the worst.
[03:14:43.265 --> 03:14:50.007]  Specialized Aschbergers, they're basically mainlining an autistic Aschbergers program on us.
[03:14:50.848 --> 03:14:51.789]  You got it.
[03:14:51.789 --> 03:14:54.711]  And again, look at the Silicon Con job.
[03:14:54.711 --> 03:14:59.255]  One of our top trends for 2017 was driverless cliff.
[03:14:59.255 --> 03:15:03.779]  We said this driverless car... There's like a death every day now all of a sudden as they roll these out.
[03:15:03.779 --> 03:15:05.681]  These cars are killing people everywhere.
[03:15:06.587 --> 03:15:11.929]  And they ignored us, and they keep ignoring us, and we showed what a fallacy it is.
[03:15:11.929 --> 03:15:16.031]  So again, we've been taken over by the geeks.
[03:15:16.031 --> 03:15:17.472]  And people don't fight back.
[03:15:17.472 --> 03:15:18.272]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:15:18.272 --> 03:15:20.213]  They admit 5G is way more powerful than a cell phone.
[03:15:20.213 --> 03:15:21.434]  It's giving you cancer.
[03:15:21.434 --> 03:15:23.474]  So when they turn this on, they are assaulting you.
[03:15:23.474 --> 03:15:24.715]  I'm not calling for this.
[03:15:24.715 --> 03:15:28.817]  But people have a right, at a certain point, to go out with a rifle and blast these things, man.
[03:15:28.817 --> 03:15:31.478]  You can't just put something that gives you cancer right there and kill everybody.
[03:15:32.603 --> 03:15:35.045]  Again, and look what they're doing to the children.
[03:15:35.045 --> 03:15:35.885]  Children are addicted.
[03:15:35.885 --> 03:15:37.807]  You go out, you see it all the time.
[03:15:37.807 --> 03:15:39.768]  You go out anywhere, they don't even talk.
[03:15:39.768 --> 03:15:41.930]  They all look at the... You're taking over, Celente.
[03:15:41.930 --> 03:15:43.311]  God bless you.
[03:15:43.311 --> 03:15:44.912]  What do we even call this segment, Mike?
[03:15:44.912 --> 03:15:48.014]  I don't even know what... It's insanity.
[03:15:48.014 --> 03:15:50.116]  We'll be back with Gerald Celente, the top trends forecaster.
[03:15:50.116 --> 03:15:50.476]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.171 --> 03:15:58.295]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:58.295 --> 03:16:03.999]  Become part of a group of self-paid patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:16:03.999 --> 03:16:09.183]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:16:09.183 --> 03:16:11.144]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:16:11.144 --> 03:16:13.506]  Holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing.
[03:16:13.506 --> 03:16:14.466]  See guidelines.
[03:16:14.466 --> 03:16:17.749]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[03:18:59.084 --> 03:19:08.471]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:19:09.262 --> 03:19:16.045]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:19:16.045 --> 03:19:18.306]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:19:18.306 --> 03:19:19.367]  Thank you.
[03:19:19.367 --> 03:19:21.868]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.

[03:19:26.170 --> 03:19:29.191]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:19:29.191 --> 03:19:30.512]  They are quality.

[03:19:35.134 --> 03:19:35.634]  Absolutely.
[03:19:36.174 --> 03:19:57.133]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:19:57.133 --> 03:19:59.776]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.322 --> 03:20:26.884]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.884 --> 03:20:29.645]  Ah, great being here.
[03:20:29.645 --> 03:20:36.146]  Real honor, privilege, to be on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:36.146 --> 03:20:37.047]  Gerald Cilenti.
[03:20:37.047 --> 03:20:40.547]  I want to talk about some of today's trends in the news.
[03:20:40.547 --> 03:20:43.128]  And one of the big trends,
[03:20:43.942 --> 03:20:48.023]  Going on right now as we speak, the equity market.
[03:20:48.023 --> 03:20:55.325]  That was down earlier today, some 750 points.
[03:20:55.325 --> 03:21:03.447]  And you well know, having heard me on Alex and the subscribers to the Trends Journal, that we were the first ones to call the Trump rally.
[03:21:03.447 --> 03:21:11.669]  About a week after he got elected back in November 2016, and I did a 180, we thought the markets were going to go down.
[03:21:12.915 --> 03:21:21.419]  Wall Street said they would go down before the election if Trump won.
[03:21:21.419 --> 03:21:22.619]  We did the opposite.
[03:21:22.619 --> 03:21:24.780]  After the election, we said it's going up.
[03:21:24.780 --> 03:21:26.501]  These are facts.
[03:21:26.501 --> 03:21:30.323]  They were betting on Clinton, who's tied very closely into Wall Street.
[03:21:30.323 --> 03:21:41.808]  Why else do you think Bill and Hillary get like a half a million three hundred thousand dollars from the banksters when they give a speech, when you can hear them BS for free all day long?
[03:21:42.298 --> 03:21:43.618]  It's called payback.
[03:21:43.618 --> 03:21:48.080]  So they were looking for the Clintons to win.
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:59.825]  And then in December of last year, you know, top trends for 2018, we said watch out for the Trump rally correction.
[03:21:59.825 --> 03:22:02.866]  And now we're in that correction.
[03:22:02.866 --> 03:22:11.749]  If you listen to the news by the prostitutes, and whether it's the business news, the political news, any news, it's a joke.
[03:22:12.765 --> 03:22:15.687]  You know why the markets are down today?
[03:22:15.687 --> 03:22:17.509]  According to them?
[03:22:17.509 --> 03:22:23.414]  Well, yeah, those Chinese, they're going to put tariffs on American companies.
[03:22:23.414 --> 03:22:24.014]  Huh.
[03:22:24.014 --> 03:22:26.516]  How much is it going to be?
[03:22:26.516 --> 03:22:29.298]  Oh, about $3 billion.
[03:22:29.298 --> 03:22:31.260]  I'm not good at math.
[03:22:31.260 --> 03:22:34.182]  But what's our trade deficit with China?
[03:22:34.182 --> 03:22:35.563]  Merchandise trade deficit?
[03:22:35.563 --> 03:22:36.844]  Oh, $375 billion?
[03:22:44.019 --> 03:22:45.100]  This is chump change.
[03:22:45.100 --> 03:22:48.563]  That's not why the markets are moving.
[03:22:48.563 --> 03:23:05.576]  And why the so-called progressives and Democrats are against, and just about all the business media, renegotiating these lousy trade deals, I can't figure it out.
[03:23:05.576 --> 03:23:10.280]  I can't figure it out because it's enriching the very rich.
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:12.522]  And that's why the big retailers don't want
[03:23:13.769 --> 03:23:36.594]  Trump to put on tariffs and renegotiate these trade deals because they could get their products made over in these third world countries and developing nations that pay the people nothing, bring the product back here and mark up the price rather than paying American workers the wage that the work is worth.
[03:23:36.594 --> 03:23:38.014]  So that's where the fight's coming from.
[03:23:39.178 --> 03:23:44.682]  The markets aren't going down today because of the Chinese $3 billion tree.
[03:23:44.682 --> 03:23:46.303]  Come on, grow up!
[03:23:46.303 --> 03:23:47.705]  Why should we grow up?
[03:23:47.705 --> 03:23:49.146]  We're prostitutes.
[03:23:49.146 --> 03:23:53.049]  We get paid to put out.
[03:23:53.049 --> 03:23:55.450]  This is stupid.
[03:23:55.450 --> 03:23:59.153]  The markets are overvalued.
[03:23:59.153 --> 03:24:02.176]  And Trump going after Amazon, man, keep going.
[03:24:02.176 --> 03:24:04.998]  It's a monopoly.
[03:24:04.998 --> 03:24:06.539]  And he's right.
[03:24:06.539 --> 03:24:07.820]  And look about
[03:24:08.436 --> 03:24:13.920]  Them using the Postal Service, which we the people, subsidize.
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:16.863]  And all the businesses they put out, it's a monopoly.
[03:24:16.863 --> 03:24:22.908]  And then you look at the price-earnings ratio of Amazon.
[03:24:22.908 --> 03:24:23.909]  A regular P.E.
[03:24:23.909 --> 03:24:30.134]  ratio, price-earnings, it's around fourteen and a half.
[03:24:30.134 --> 03:24:34.157]  That's a solid one.
[03:24:34.157 --> 03:24:38.000]  So every stock you buy, they make fourteen and a half bucks.
[03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:44.124]  They have over 300 P.E.
[03:24:44.124 --> 03:24:45.805]  ratio.
[03:24:45.805 --> 03:24:54.853]  They're not making a lot of money, but they've done a great job putting bookstores out of business and a lot of other people.
[03:24:54.853 --> 03:25:01.158]  And now, again, they're using the Washington Post that Bezos owns as a propaganda tool.
[03:25:01.158 --> 03:25:04.641]  And boy, you want to hear an anti-Russian propaganda mill
[03:25:05.638 --> 03:25:23.295]  Between the New York Slime, the New York Times, the Toilet Paper Record, and the Washington Post, they got a battle going on between them to see how they could make us hate Russia more.
[03:25:23.295 --> 03:25:25.197]  And Bezos owns it.
[03:25:25.197 --> 03:25:30.602]  And then the arrogance and stupidity of the moron politician
[03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:45.612]  That are giving Amazon seven billion dollars in tax breaks if they open up one of their slave camps in a state in a city near you.
[03:25:45.612 --> 03:25:46.673]  It's not a tax break.
[03:25:46.673 --> 03:25:56.194]  We the taxpayers have to subsidize a guy like Bezos who's worth over a hundred billion dollars.
[03:25:56.194 --> 03:25:58.235]  It's disgusting.
[03:25:58.235 --> 03:25:59.635]  And you know why it's disgusting?
[03:26:00.791 --> 03:26:08.316]  Because we got a bunch of disgusting people called politicians running and ruining our lives.
[03:26:08.316 --> 03:26:10.957]  And again, name the country, name the freak.
[03:26:10.957 --> 03:26:14.379]  You like Macron, the garcon over there in France?
[03:26:14.379 --> 03:26:16.961]  Oh yeah, he's gonna send troops into Syria now.
[03:26:16.961 --> 03:26:18.182]  That's the latest with him.
[03:26:18.182 --> 03:26:20.443]  A little boy of nothing.
[03:26:20.443 --> 03:26:23.185]  Maybe Theresa May's the one you like better.
[03:26:23.185 --> 03:26:27.007]  Again, name the country, name the freaks.
[03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:28.008]  They're all over the world.
[03:26:29.321 --> 03:26:32.103]  And we're taking orders from them?
[03:26:32.103 --> 03:26:35.505]  As they're destroying our lives?
[03:26:35.505 --> 03:26:37.146]  And the media keeps promoting it.
[03:26:37.146 --> 03:26:39.187]  So going back to the markets.
[03:26:39.187 --> 03:26:42.008]  The markets are overvalued and overleveraged.
[03:26:42.008 --> 03:26:43.809]  End of story.
[03:26:43.809 --> 03:26:47.932]  And now you're seeing the tech stocks down almost 3% today.
[03:26:47.932 --> 03:26:52.074]  They're way overvalued and overleveraged.
[03:26:52.074 --> 03:26:54.135]  So, gold.
[03:26:54.135 --> 03:26:57.157]  Gold today was up almost 20 bucks.
[03:26:57.157 --> 03:26:58.398]  But it still can't get
[03:26:59.068 --> 03:27:01.289]  Into that other range.
[03:27:01.289 --> 03:27:03.610]  And that's where it has to go.
[03:27:03.610 --> 03:27:17.276]  And before we go, and getting in that other range, and gold is that safe haven commodity, you also want that safe haven body armor at the Info Wars store.
[03:27:17.276 --> 03:27:20.618]  The best protection for less.
[03:27:20.618 --> 03:27:27.681]  Protecting yourself is the number one concern, as I keep saying, of any informed and prepared citizen.
[03:27:29.346 --> 03:27:38.291]  So, that's why InfoWars is proud to offer the best in American-made, high-quality, affordable body armor.
[03:27:38.291 --> 03:27:42.653]  Protecting your loved ones and yourself has never been easier.
[03:27:42.653 --> 03:27:49.577]  They range from backpack-sized defense to full body protection.
[03:27:49.577 --> 03:27:56.341]  They have a wide variety of sizes, protection levels, and even colors to give you all the options you need.
[03:27:57.449 --> 03:28:00.270]  Again, things are unwinding here.
[03:28:00.270 --> 03:28:03.370]  You know, GCs, 3Gs.
[03:28:03.370 --> 03:28:06.451]  Guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[03:28:06.451 --> 03:28:09.251]  Put some body armor on that, too.
[03:28:09.251 --> 03:28:13.112]  Because things are also heating up in the Middle East.
[03:28:13.112 --> 03:28:19.413]  If things really blow up, man, it's gonna blow up in a city, a county, in a state near you.
[03:28:19.413 --> 03:28:24.794]  So body armor at InfoWars stores, the best protection for less.
[03:28:26.311 --> 03:28:28.313]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[03:28:28.313 --> 03:28:31.195]  Stay tuned and support InfoWars.

[03:29:55.051 --> 03:29:55.631]  Good, brother.
[03:29:55.631 --> 03:29:57.573]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:29:57.573 --> 03:29:59.294]  Everything you said about them is correct.

[03:30:21.314 --> 03:30:24.357]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:30:24.357 --> 03:30:25.999]  They've been a ton of money there.
[03:30:25.999 --> 03:30:31.305]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:30:31.305 --> 03:30:33.866]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[03:30:33.866 --> 03:30:45.849]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[03:30:53.939 --> 03:31:04.530]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:31:04.530 --> 03:31:06.592]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:31:06.592 --> 03:31:09.475]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:31:09.475 --> 03:31:10.656]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:11.297 --> 03:31:17.759]  Filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow work.
[03:31:17.759 --> 03:31:19.840]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:29.563]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:29.563 --> 03:31:40.386]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you
[03:31:40.546 --> 03:31:46.375]  The remnant of America to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:46.375 --> 03:31:49.680]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:53.025]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com
[03:31:53.820 --> 03:31:57.563]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:31:57.563 --> 03:32:04.607]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:32:04.607 --> 03:32:09.371]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:32:09.371 --> 03:32:10.111]  It's very simple.
[03:32:10.111 --> 03:32:12.613]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:32:12.613 --> 03:32:14.554]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:32:14.554 --> 03:32:16.395]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:32:16.395 --> 03:32:17.536]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:32:17.536 --> 03:32:18.277]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:32:23.220 --> 03:32:26.262]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:32:26.262 --> 03:32:30.685]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:32:30.685 --> 03:32:34.548]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:32:34.548 --> 03:32:38.410]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:32:38.410 --> 03:32:41.592]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:32:41.592 --> 03:32:45.215]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:32:45.215 --> 03:32:47.816]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:32:47.816 --> 03:32:48.837]  It's amazing.
[03:32:48.837 --> 03:32:51.359]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:57.168 --> 03:33:00.249]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:00.249 --> 03:33:07.410]  Quiet music.
[03:33:27.645 --> 03:33:30.246]  Watch me take some male vitality.
[03:33:30.246 --> 03:33:32.987]  Get that boogie going.
[03:33:32.987 --> 03:33:35.028]  Great being on Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.028 --> 03:33:36.288]  This is Gerald Cilenti.
[03:33:36.288 --> 03:33:38.449]  It's always a treat to be here.
[03:33:38.449 --> 03:33:41.810]  And I was talking about the equity markets.
[03:33:41.810 --> 03:33:46.872]  So now, the Nasdaq is down over 3%.
[03:33:46.872 --> 03:33:49.693]  Dow's down about 580.
[03:33:49.693 --> 03:33:53.794]  Gold's still up there, but it can't break over that 1385 mark.
[03:33:56.380 --> 03:33:58.681]  That's where it has to go.
[03:33:58.681 --> 03:34:06.685]  Again, I don't give financial advice, but I'll tell you the story, and I've been saying the same story now for four years.
[03:34:06.685 --> 03:34:19.671]  The downside risk of gold right now, not this part for four years, but this part for the better part of a year, is another $100 down.
[03:34:19.671 --> 03:34:25.034]  That's about the worst that I see gold going, on the downside.
[03:34:25.723 --> 03:34:36.730]  It has to break above $13.85, which it hasn't been able to do, to reach the next level, which is $14.50.
[03:34:36.730 --> 03:34:40.373]  When it hits the $14.50 mark, boom!
[03:34:40.373 --> 03:34:42.454]  Zap!
[03:34:42.454 --> 03:34:44.956]  $2000 plus.
[03:34:44.956 --> 03:34:48.978]  That part I've been saying now for four years.
[03:34:48.978 --> 03:34:51.180]  And it hasn't done that.
[03:34:51.180 --> 03:34:54.442]  So, follow gold as you follow the markets.
[03:34:56.312 --> 03:35:00.053]  Markets go lower, goals should be going higher.
[03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:05.635]  And again, why the markets going down?
[03:35:05.635 --> 03:35:11.338]  One reason, the biggest one, interest rates!
[03:35:11.338 --> 03:35:20.521]  The higher interest rates go, all that corporate debt that they got over there, guess what?
[03:35:20.521 --> 03:35:23.342]  All the personal debt they got there, guess what?
[03:35:24.148 --> 03:35:27.369]  All the government debt out there, guess what?
[03:35:27.369 --> 03:35:38.672]  It's going to cost you more to pay as interest rates go higher and the whole stock market is nothing more than a scheme.
[03:35:38.672 --> 03:35:52.855]  It's a gambler's paradise and the central banksters gave the gamblers all the money that they wanted by negative and zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing.
[03:35:54.517 --> 03:36:08.708]  And now the junkies, the money junkies, are freaking out because they can't get their fix, their money fix, for free.
[03:36:08.708 --> 03:36:10.449]  That's why the markets are going down.
[03:36:10.449 --> 03:36:13.011]  End of story with everything else.
[03:36:13.011 --> 03:36:15.433]  Yeah.
[03:36:15.433 --> 03:36:16.854]  Borrowed time.
[03:36:16.854 --> 03:36:20.937]  Rising debt costs pose private equity challenge.
[03:36:21.539 --> 03:36:23.981]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:36:23.981 --> 03:36:27.503]  Private equity firms are writing large checks.
[03:36:27.503 --> 03:36:38.472]  In January, it was Blackstone with a $17 billion acquisition of the Finance and Risk Division of Thomson Reuters.
[03:36:38.472 --> 03:36:48.219]  Now, it is Carlyle with a $10 billion purchase of Axco Noble's specialty chemical units.
[03:36:49.833 --> 03:36:51.214]  This is just the beginning.
[03:36:51.214 --> 03:36:58.479]  More merger and acquisition activity has happened this year for this amount of time than any other time.
[03:36:58.479 --> 03:37:02.802]  When I was a young guy, there were no private equities.
[03:37:02.802 --> 03:37:07.385]  There were no Blackstones or Carlyles.
[03:37:07.385 --> 03:37:08.906]  No corporations anymore.
[03:37:08.906 --> 03:37:11.847]  It's all the money people own everything.
[03:37:11.847 --> 03:37:13.969]  And they keep consolidating everything.
[03:37:14.833 --> 03:37:17.575]  Putting on you, we're not getting this money for free.
[03:37:17.575 --> 03:37:20.556]  They get these huge debt piles.
[03:37:20.556 --> 03:37:22.697]  Look what happened to Toys R Us.
[03:37:22.697 --> 03:37:24.018]  Toys are gone, man.
[03:37:24.018 --> 03:37:31.822]  Oh, they have over $5 billion worth of debt from the private equity deal that was done when they bought them out.
[03:37:31.822 --> 03:37:34.384]  You want to talk about the Amazon monopoly?
[03:37:34.384 --> 03:37:38.426]  The whole world is monopolized.
[03:37:38.426 --> 03:37:40.447]  Private equity groups.
[03:37:40.447 --> 03:37:42.468]  Banksters, scamsters, man.
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:44.881]  And women gotta be equal.
[03:37:44.881 --> 03:37:46.502]  Yep.
[03:37:46.502 --> 03:37:49.063]  That's what's going on.
[03:37:49.063 --> 03:37:51.124]  Interest rates.
[03:37:51.124 --> 03:37:53.986]  Yeah.
[03:37:53.986 --> 03:37:57.688]  Student debt could hold back economic growth.
[03:37:57.688 --> 03:38:08.674]  More than 80% of the people age 20 to 35 with student debt who haven't bought a house yet blame their educational loans.
[03:38:08.674 --> 03:38:10.175]  Spending all that money
[03:38:11.707 --> 03:38:15.551]  To get a degree in worthlessness.
[03:38:15.551 --> 03:38:21.156]  I mentioned this one woman here in this story.
[03:38:21.156 --> 03:38:30.264]  Stephanie Pinecuff graduated from Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis with $43,000 in debt.
[03:38:30.264 --> 03:38:31.766]  She works for a non-profit.
[03:38:33.072 --> 03:38:42.178]  Helping formerly incarcerated people transition back into the communities, making around $30,000 a year.
[03:38:42.178 --> 03:38:47.041]  A monthly student loan payment is $450.
[03:38:47.041 --> 03:38:51.443]  You look at the numbers.
[03:38:51.443 --> 03:38:52.264]  They're all here.
[03:38:52.264 --> 03:38:57.967]  Some 45 million people in the United States carry student debt.
[03:38:57.967 --> 03:39:00.068]  The average borrower owes more.
[03:39:00.068 --> 03:39:00.809]  You ready for this?
[03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:07.352]  $30,000 educational system.
[03:39:07.352 --> 03:39:09.654]  It's a freak show!
[03:39:09.654 --> 03:39:16.760]  If we had any decent education system, you think we'd be in so much trouble that we have right now?
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:18.781]  If we were educated?
[03:39:18.781 --> 03:39:19.902]  We're not educated.
[03:39:19.902 --> 03:39:23.565]  It's a propaganda mill.
[03:39:23.565 --> 03:39:25.386]  We're brainwashed.
[03:39:25.386 --> 03:39:28.388]  Brainwashed into stupidity.
[03:39:28.388 --> 03:39:29.049]  And by the way,
[03:39:30.063 --> 03:39:33.265]  Take a trip around the world, it's starting to change.
[03:39:33.265 --> 03:39:39.449]  The education system we have is a relic from the Industrial Age, invented by Germany.
[03:39:39.449 --> 03:39:44.292]  One of our top trends is Interactive U. That's right.
[03:39:44.292 --> 03:39:46.293]  Learning online.
[03:39:46.293 --> 03:39:49.715]  And they're doing it in India, big time.
[03:39:49.715 --> 03:39:54.098]  Courses developed for your mind, not general education.
[03:39:54.098 --> 03:39:56.660]  General this, general that, general garbage.
[03:39:58.194 --> 03:40:04.797]  You gotta learn a bunch of jerk stuff because some morons are telling you that this is what you need?
[03:40:04.797 --> 03:40:08.298]  I got left back in the fifth grade.
[03:40:08.298 --> 03:40:10.019]  I ran away from kindergarten.
[03:40:10.019 --> 03:40:12.460]  I hated every day of school.
[03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:13.560]  And I wasn't rebelling.
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:18.102]  It was just a bunch of stuff I couldn't understand.
[03:40:18.102 --> 03:40:20.683]  Interactive you.
[03:40:20.683 --> 03:40:27.206]  When I put your money where your mind is, also, if you're an investor, I would consider looking at the companies that are expanding in that field.
[03:40:27.648 --> 03:40:29.169]  In other countries.
[03:40:29.169 --> 03:40:31.090]  It's the future.
[03:40:31.090 --> 03:40:45.917]  And the future is, again, for those of us that want to stay alive, stay healthy, be on our own and function at the best, is to consider, of course, all those great products that InfoWars offers.
[03:40:45.917 --> 03:40:51.040]  And one of them is they're introducing Immune Goggle.
[03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:54.582]  It's available at an introductory sale price at 33% off.
[03:40:57.555 --> 03:41:03.601]  Again, staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:41:03.601 --> 03:41:06.544]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:41:06.544 --> 03:41:18.016]  That's why InfoWars created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line, Super Blue Silver Immune Goggle.
[03:41:18.016 --> 03:41:21.259]  It's an incredible new purifying formula.
[03:41:22.250 --> 03:41:25.391]  With an all-purpose use.
[03:41:25.391 --> 03:41:28.232]  Super blue, super immune goggle.
[03:41:28.232 --> 03:41:30.832]  Comes in a convenient small bottle.
[03:41:30.832 --> 03:41:33.753]  Or as we say in the Bronx, bottle.
[03:41:33.753 --> 03:41:36.774]  It's densest recommended for daily use.
[03:41:36.774 --> 03:41:40.415]  Whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[03:41:40.415 --> 03:41:44.836]  And not only is it a powerful hand purifier.
[03:41:44.836 --> 03:41:47.137]  It can also be used orally.
[03:41:47.137 --> 03:41:49.778]  Just spray a small amount in your mouth.
[03:41:49.778 --> 03:41:50.958]  Swish and swallow.
[03:41:52.466 --> 03:41:55.668]  Whenever you feel surrounded by toxins.
[03:41:55.668 --> 03:41:59.510]  So again, put your money where your mind is, where your heart is.
[03:41:59.510 --> 03:42:01.931]  You want to keep InfoWars going.
[03:42:01.931 --> 03:42:12.016]  Trends Journal, all us out there, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others, that put the truth on the line as they're selling lies.
[03:42:12.016 --> 03:42:13.416]  So support InfoWars.
[03:42:13.416 --> 03:42:15.017]  These products are important.
[03:42:15.017 --> 03:42:16.718]  Particularly one like this.
[03:42:16.718 --> 03:42:20.500]  If you fly, you got to go on those lousy airplanes.
[03:42:22.857 --> 03:42:25.963]  And boy, oh boy, the germs and stuff on there.
[03:42:25.963 --> 03:42:30.271]  You want to have immune goggles.
[03:42:30.271 --> 03:42:33.297]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:42:33.297 --> 03:42:34.800]  And watch those pockets.
[03:42:53.365 --> 03:42:55.705]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:42:55.705 --> 03:42:57.866]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:42:57.866 --> 03:43:01.786]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[03:43:13.288 --> 03:43:22.390]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[03:43:58.979 --> 03:43:59.880]  They take hours.

[03:44:02.322 --> 03:44:03.503]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.503 --> 03:44:05.104]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:05.104 --> 03:44:08.347]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.347 --> 03:44:09.468]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.468 --> 03:44:12.630]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:16.413]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.413 --> 03:44:19.516]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.

[03:44:48.459 --> 03:44:51.501]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:44:57.025 --> 03:44:58.406]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[03:44:58.406 --> 03:45:00.668]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:45:00.668 --> 03:45:01.108]  Great!
[03:45:01.108 --> 03:45:02.229]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:06.773]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:45:06.773 --> 03:45:08.474]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:45:08.474 --> 03:45:16.040]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:45:16.040 --> 03:45:16.801]  Wow, thank you.
[03:45:16.801 --> 03:45:19.283]  You're the top illustrator that makes it all possible.
[03:45:19.283 --> 03:45:20.844]  Which nutraceutical do you like best?
[03:45:21.084 --> 03:45:24.547]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:45:24.547 --> 03:45:25.068]  That's amazing.
[03:45:25.068 --> 03:45:25.829]  That's really incredible.
[03:45:25.829 --> 03:45:28.892]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:45:28.892 --> 03:45:30.253]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[03:45:30.253 --> 03:45:31.914]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:45:31.914 --> 03:45:42.184]  And I love the guys, I love the Info Wars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:45:42.184 --> 03:45:43.205]  You will love it.
[03:45:43.205 --> 03:45:43.706]  I'm telling you.
[03:45:43.706 --> 03:45:45.047]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:45:45.327 --> 03:45:49.748]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:49.748 --> 03:45:54.510]  It's the win-win InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:54.510 --> 03:46:00.811]  InfoWarsLife Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[03:46:00.811 --> 03:46:09.214]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:46:09.214 --> 03:46:13.515]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup
[03:46:14.275 --> 03:46:18.018]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[03:46:18.018 --> 03:46:20.840]  Well now it's 50% off.
[03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:29.267]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[03:46:29.267 --> 03:46:31.089]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[03:46:31.089 --> 03:46:32.590]  But the two go together.
[03:46:32.590 --> 03:46:34.611]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[03:46:34.611 --> 03:46:43.759]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoHorseLife.com.
[03:46:44.099 --> 03:46:49.282]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[03:46:49.282 --> 03:46:56.645]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[03:46:56.645 --> 03:46:59.267]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:21.764 --> 03:47:24.105]  Hey, it's great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.105 --> 03:47:25.026]  It's really an honor.
[03:47:25.026 --> 03:47:26.867]  Love doing it.
[03:47:26.867 --> 03:47:29.308]  I go to InfoWars all the time.
[03:47:29.308 --> 03:47:31.009]  See what news they have out there.
[03:47:31.009 --> 03:47:41.255]  One of the stories that was out recently, London murder rate now beats New York after surge of stabbings.
[03:47:41.255 --> 03:47:41.855]  Huh.
[03:47:41.855 --> 03:47:43.336]  Stabbings.
[03:47:43.336 --> 03:47:46.918]  I say we gotta ban the knives.
[03:47:46.918 --> 03:47:49.180]  You know what the point I'm making?
[03:47:49.180 --> 03:47:50.500]  People want to do crazy things.
[03:47:50.500 --> 03:47:51.441]  You don't need guns.
[03:47:52.853 --> 03:47:59.195]  Banning guns isn't going to stop a psychopath from doing crazy things.
[03:47:59.195 --> 03:48:12.759]  Putting up all these road barriers everywhere is not going to stop somebody from crazy person driving a car up on the sidewalk and mowing down masses.
[03:48:12.759 --> 03:48:14.220]  It's not going to stop anything.
[03:48:14.952 --> 03:48:16.734]  Oh, we're going to put more police on the street.
[03:48:16.734 --> 03:48:19.356]  These guys with all this stuff.
[03:48:19.356 --> 03:48:20.257]  Take it easy, man.
[03:48:20.257 --> 03:48:27.564]  Somebody wants to put a belt on them and blow you up and everybody around you, you ain't going to stop them.
[03:48:27.564 --> 03:48:30.987]  The psychology has to change.
[03:48:30.987 --> 03:48:35.351]  America is a nation of violence with all the wars going on.
[03:48:35.351 --> 03:48:37.373]  And you know, I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:48:37.373 --> 03:48:38.994]  Occupypeace.us.
[03:48:38.994 --> 03:48:40.716]  Occupypeace.com.
[03:48:43.206 --> 03:48:47.049]  It'll change the mentality.
[03:48:47.049 --> 03:48:50.231]  Fish rots from the head down.
[03:48:50.231 --> 03:48:53.874]  It's great what Trump is saying about pulling out of Syria.
[03:48:53.874 --> 03:48:55.735]  I hope it happens.
[03:48:55.735 --> 03:48:57.216]  Enough.
[03:48:57.216 --> 03:48:59.177]  Assad has to go!
[03:48:59.177 --> 03:49:12.887]  Arrogant Obama said, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, along with Hillary Clinton, Frankenstein, Kerry, and all the other freaks and fools and liars and cowards, running and ruining the nation.
[03:49:14.039 --> 03:49:16.099]  What they did to Libya.
[03:49:16.099 --> 03:49:24.722]  So, if mass murder comes from the top, hey, why not have it on the street?
[03:49:24.722 --> 03:49:28.903]  So it's the psychology to me that has to change.
[03:49:28.903 --> 03:49:37.224]  But, going back to this article, more people were murdered in London in February than in New York City.
[03:49:37.224 --> 03:49:43.446]  UK's capital overtook the US city murder rate for the first time after 15th person was killed.
[03:49:45.620 --> 03:49:50.903]  Then, most of the killings in the Capitol have been stabbings.
[03:49:50.903 --> 03:50:07.833]  And the Met Police Chief, Cressidia Dick, recently suggested the force plan to increase stop and search to counter this.
[03:50:07.833 --> 03:50:14.857]  Quote, victims' parents all say, get out and do more, Miss Dick said.
[03:50:16.428 --> 03:50:20.371]  So it's one thing you'll see in the next year.
[03:50:20.371 --> 03:50:35.000]  We won't be held back by political correctness, but it will be fair and irrespective of race.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.083]  Said Miss Dick.
[03:50:40.083 --> 03:50:40.323]  Fair.
[03:50:41.095 --> 03:50:43.276]  Pure stupidity.
[03:50:43.276 --> 03:50:45.997]  Robbing people of more of their rights.
[03:50:45.997 --> 03:50:49.619]  It won't stop anything.
[03:50:49.619 --> 03:50:54.641]  Anybody that's a fighter knows.
[03:50:54.641 --> 03:50:58.662]  You want to pull it off, you'll pull it off.
[03:50:58.662 --> 03:50:59.623]  But no, no.
[03:50:59.623 --> 03:51:03.544]  We'll just rob your rights away from you.
[03:51:03.544 --> 03:51:07.966]  Hey, want to ban guns?
[03:51:07.966 --> 03:51:10.127]  Horror on streets of Germany.
[03:51:11.062 --> 03:51:18.953]  State of emergency declared as 80 men brawl with machetes.
[03:51:18.953 --> 03:51:19.474]  That's right.
[03:51:19.474 --> 03:51:22.418]  This is going on right now.
[03:51:22.418 --> 03:51:23.520]  It's like two days ago.
[03:51:26.266 --> 03:51:29.468]  But no, we're gonna ban guns and we'll really be stupid.
[03:51:29.468 --> 03:51:35.612]  There are only about 350 million guns out there, and if somebody wants to get one to do whatever they want to do, they'll do it.
[03:51:35.612 --> 03:51:43.317]  And you don't need a gun, you could use a bomb, you could use a car, you could use a machete, you could use a knife.
[03:51:43.317 --> 03:51:47.359]  And if you listen to the politicians and Ms.
[03:51:47.359 --> 03:51:49.921]  Dick, you could use stupidity.
[03:51:49.921 --> 03:51:53.423]  Before I forget, going back to the markets.
[03:51:54.281 --> 03:52:02.687]  Again, the propaganda coming out today, they're blaming it all on tariffs that China's putting on the U.S.
[03:52:02.687 --> 03:52:06.790]  for the grand total of nothing, $3 billion.
[03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:14.556]  With a merchandise trade deficit with the United States that we have against China of $375 billion.
[03:52:14.556 --> 03:52:16.237]  There's nothing.
[03:52:16.237 --> 03:52:18.839]  So, this is the kind of work that I do every day.
[03:52:18.839 --> 03:52:20.961]  I gotta read all this stuff.
[03:52:22.032 --> 03:52:23.333]  And an outline story.
[03:52:23.333 --> 03:52:33.058]  So this, just pull this out, to show you what's going on in the markets has nothing to do with tariffs.
[03:52:33.058 --> 03:52:43.023]  It has to do with interest rates and the other reasons I've given you, overvalued stocks, and also over leveraged.
[03:52:43.023 --> 03:52:46.024]  Tech worries drag down stocks.
[03:52:46.024 --> 03:52:48.826]  Tech shares sank Tuesday,
[03:52:49.736 --> 03:52:56.700]  Amid a series of setbacks for major firms and a broad retreat from risk.
[03:52:56.700 --> 03:52:57.301]  Risk.
[03:52:57.301 --> 03:53:01.803]  From gambling on overvalued stocks.
[03:53:01.803 --> 03:53:08.587]  This is from Wednesday, March 28th.
[03:53:08.587 --> 03:53:11.229]  What's today?
[03:53:11.229 --> 03:53:13.870]  April 2nd.
[03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:17.873]  And they're blaming it on China.
[03:53:17.873 --> 03:53:18.233]  And Trump.
[03:53:19.113 --> 03:53:22.375]  Because we're prostitutes.
[03:53:22.375 --> 03:53:28.899]  And if you're not blaming it on China and Trump, who could you blame it on?
[03:53:28.899 --> 03:53:31.221]  Well, let's see what we could do over here.
[03:53:31.221 --> 03:53:37.184]  From Moscow with murder, Russia hunting defectors in America?
[03:53:37.184 --> 03:53:40.306]  A question mark.
[03:53:40.306 --> 03:53:44.469]  This is from the piece of garbage called Newsweek.
[03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:46.390]  This is how they're selling hate.
[03:53:48.328 --> 03:53:51.369]  From Moscow with Murder.
[03:53:51.369 --> 03:53:55.011]  A little clown of a jerk, Jeff Stein.
[03:53:55.011 --> 03:53:58.373]  How about Jeff Slime?
[03:53:58.373 --> 03:54:04.715]  Or just Slime, to write a headline like this.
[03:54:04.715 --> 03:54:06.356]  From Moscow with Murder.
[03:54:06.356 --> 03:54:09.538]  Russia hunting defectors in America.
[03:54:09.538 --> 03:54:10.378]  They get lonely.
[03:54:11.232 --> 03:54:14.374]  They miss their friends and family left behind in Russia.
[03:54:14.374 --> 03:54:28.025]  And so, despite the danger of exposing themselves to Kremlin retribution, Russian defectors, hiding abroad, make phone calls and send emails back to relatives in the motherland.
[03:54:28.025 --> 03:54:32.428]  And when they do, that Kremlin is listening.
[03:54:32.428 --> 03:54:33.229]  Hey!
[03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:34.890]  Slime Stein!
[03:54:34.890 --> 03:54:38.033]  We got the NSA listening to every damn thing we do!
[03:54:39.562 --> 03:54:46.687]  We got jerks like Miss Dick telling us we're gonna frisk you more!
[03:54:46.687 --> 03:54:49.530]  But now, let's make the hate Russia thing.
[03:54:49.530 --> 03:54:51.191]  Oh, they killed a spy over there.
[03:54:51.191 --> 03:54:52.292]  Well, they didn't kill him.
[03:54:52.292 --> 03:54:55.734]  They poisoned him, but they won't give him any proof over there in the UK.
[03:54:55.734 --> 03:54:59.997]  No, we just said so because that's the propaganda we're putting out.
[03:54:59.997 --> 03:55:03.960]  And again, it wasn't like they killed Mary Poppins, you know, or Mother Teresa here.
[03:55:03.960 --> 03:55:07.103]  Or tried to, allegedly.
[03:55:07.742 --> 03:55:11.004]  That guy was a former spy to nobody.
[03:55:11.004 --> 03:55:12.905]  Why would they do that?
[03:55:12.905 --> 03:55:14.505]  Propaganda.
[03:55:14.505 --> 03:55:16.446]  Want more propaganda?
[03:55:16.446 --> 03:55:19.388]  Again, this is stuff I gotta read every day.
[03:55:19.388 --> 03:55:21.649]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:55:21.649 --> 03:55:24.450]  Bannon and the big question.
[03:55:24.450 --> 03:55:31.334]  Should we have given a platform to controversial... to controversialists?
[03:55:31.334 --> 03:55:35.576]  Fresh from talking to Trump's incendiary former advisor.
[03:55:37.372 --> 03:55:42.535]  Lionel Barber reflects on the art of the interview.
[03:55:42.535 --> 03:55:46.637]  The email to the editor was just to the point.
[03:55:46.637 --> 03:55:58.904]  Justin Quirk was canceling his subscription in light of FT's decision to book Steve Bannon for a forthcoming event in New York on the Future of News.
[03:55:58.904 --> 03:56:01.166]  Now here's what this guy writes.
[03:56:01.166 --> 03:56:03.407]  This is Lionel Barber.
[03:56:06.053 --> 03:56:16.357]  Now in my near 40 years in journalism, prostitutism, I have interviewed many people of questionable character.
[03:56:16.357 --> 03:56:31.043]  As editor, I have sat down with strong men such as Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, and Vladimir Putin of Russia.
[03:56:31.043 --> 03:56:35.605]  Each might be said to have blood on their hands.
[03:56:38.134 --> 03:56:41.855]  Hey, did you interview George Bush?
[03:56:41.855 --> 03:56:44.935]  That cat got blood on his hands?
[03:56:44.935 --> 03:56:59.518]  How about Slick Willie Clinton and Hillary Clinton and Samantha Powers, Susan Rice and Barack, quote, I'm really good at killing people, Obama.
[03:56:59.518 --> 03:57:00.259]  Interview them?
[03:57:00.259 --> 03:57:01.519]  Barbara?
[03:57:04.335 --> 03:57:06.476]  They got blood on their hands?
