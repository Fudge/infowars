[00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:12.695]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:55.446]  I always wanted to go toe-to-toe with the globalists with George Soros and the Rothschilds and the New World Order and the Rockefeller Combine.
[00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:03.690]  Now we're toe-to-toe, ladies and gentlemen, toe-to-toe at point-blank range with their lie machine, their deception machine, their poverty machine.
[00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:12.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I have ever done today.
[00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.837]  And at the bottom of the hour, I am going to lay out
[00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:24.501]  Exactly what they're planning, exactly what they're doing, and how they're going to move against everyone.
[00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:28.604]  There is no doubt we know about their plan for an October supplies.
[00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:45.695]  We know about their entire concerted operation to bring us down, everyone else down, and we know about it mainly because Senator Warner and Senator Murphy and others have been writing memos and talking about it, and now the memos have leaked and are public.
[00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:50.228]  And I have my big blue chip D.C.
[00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.791]  law firm with this intel report.
[00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.554]  Attorney-client privilege, but I've blacked out the names.
[00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.498]  And I'm going to let you see this coming up.
[00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:04.160]  This is the admitted battle plan.
[00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:09.605]  By next year to have no conservatives, no libertarians, no talk radio, you name it.
[00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.447]  Now you ask how they're going to do it?
[00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.408]  You know how they're going to do it.
[00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.892]  First it was going to be 100 newspapers, now it's 350.
[00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:25.143]  All writing editorials saying that Trump is going to cause violence against the media by, when they call him a liar or a Nazi, he says they're liars.
[00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:27.066]  They say that's going to cause violence.
[00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:44.201]  Then they promote violence, just like they edit what I've said when Antifa says in front of the White House with signs and more than 15 people on video, we've got bullets for the Republicans, we've got bullets for Trump, we're coming to kill them at their houses, we're going to kill their families.
[00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:49.664]  I say, man, if I was one of these people targeted by Antifa, I would have my battle rifle by my bed.
[00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:58.070]  That turns into Alex Jones is going to use a battle rifle on Lester Holt, and Lester Holt
[00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:07.280]  Literally looks at a piece of paper and goes, Jones essentially said he's going to engage in criminal activity and come after us with weapons.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.620]  I'm scared.
[00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.341]  Total hoax.
[00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:12.161]  He didn't show a video, nothing.
[00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:17.802]  And my lawyers have never seen anything like it.
[00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:20.063]  They say they are stunned.
[00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:24.423]  And they agree they are making their complete move.
[00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:27.824]  And I just got off the phone with high-level folks in talk radio.
[00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.769]  They've confirmed this.
[00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.530]  I mean, they are making their move.
[00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:43.513]  Barry Diller said earlier this year, big globalist Democrat, one of the founders of Fox News, he said, we will have paid internet, everyone will be off the web, all the competition by 2019.
[00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:47.494]  The Wall Street Journal said that five months ago as well.
[00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:49.075]  You ask how are they going to do it?
[00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.095]  How are you going to do that?
[00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:56.517]  You sell the point that the president and Alex Jones and alternative media
[00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.416]  is going to cause violence.
[00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:04.017]  You then promote the violence.
[00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:05.498]  You then edit what people said.
[00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.062]  You then provocateur or stage an event against yourself.
[00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:17.707]  And then the Democrats sweep in in the 2018 midterms as their false flag.
[00:04:18.407 --> 00:04:19.788]  I'm going to break it all down at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.272]  Remember Bill Clinton on Air Force One to USA Today, the New York Times, all of them in 1996 said
[00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:29.927]  I owe my re-election.
[00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:33.431]  We were 10 points behind to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:35.113]  Which we know was a false flag.
[00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:36.975]  We've interviewed the police officers, the witnesses.
[00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:38.296]  We have the hotel receipts.
[00:04:38.337 --> 00:04:39.177]  World Net Daily does.
[00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:39.858]  They proved it all.
[00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.440]  There were law firms involved.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.581]  It all came out in lawsuits.
[00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:44.223]  That the feds bombed that.
[00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.907]  Out of Elohim City and the Southern Primary Law Center was running that group.
[00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:49.669]  And that's all come out.
[00:04:51.491 --> 00:05:00.430]  And so that's the only way they've got to win the midterms is a big terror attack against a media institution, a fake media group, or big tech to be blamed on us.
[00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:05.883]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.864]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now 100% crystal clear.
[00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.326]  Like the deepest blue sky.
[00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:32.614]  In the high desert.
[00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:45.918]  The desperate corporate dying media, the desperate dying Democratic Party, the desperate dying globalist combine of the Rockefellers and Soros is being defeated on a planetary scale.
[00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:59.521]  They're desperately organizing in Europe and in the United States in the halls of power to bring in draconian censorship of nationalist and populist movements who are awake and winning elections everywhere.
[00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:06.941]  They're putting total censorship grids into places that are going nationalist and patriot conservative like Brazil.
[00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:08.981]  Like France.
[00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.642]  The list goes on and on.
[00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:14.403]  And how are they going to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat?
[00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:17.883]  How are they going to do it?
[00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:19.584]  They've said it.
[00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:22.495]  It started about six months ago.
[00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:25.336]  If Trump criticizes the media, he's calling for violence.
[00:07:25.617 --> 00:07:26.617]  There's going to be violence.
[00:07:26.637 --> 00:07:27.877]  There will be blood on his hands.
[00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:40.321]  Thousands of CNN, MSNBC comments, thousands of articles, 300 plus dying today, all publishing in unison in a coordinated effort, saying Trump's calling for violence.
[00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.182]  There's going to be violence.
[00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:41.942]  There's going to be violence.
[00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:42.822]  And he's not.
[00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:47.524]  They're calling for violence and desperately saying we're in a civil war.
[00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:50.525]  We hope it doesn't have to get violent, says Rob Reiner.
[00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:53.720]  But whatever happens, it's gonna happen.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.640]  On and on and on.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.681]  A Trump's hate movement against the media.
[00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:10.945]  And then, in the last 24 hours, they've had thousands of fake news publications come out in a unified, concerted script and say, quote, Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist.
[00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:12.566]  He's going to kill people.
[00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.146]  With no link to where I said it.
[00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:15.247]  The lawyers have seen it.
[00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:17.007]  Open and shut.
[00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:19.168]  Lawsuit will be lost.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.163]  Unless by the time that lawsuit gets filed, it's happened.
[00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.547]  They have thrown all caution to the wind.
[00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.173]  They are lying everywhere, showing none of the proof.
[00:08:33.674 --> 00:08:36.717]  CNN article accuses Infowars of being complicit in domestic terror.
[00:08:36.737 --> 00:08:37.758]  That's yesterday.
[00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.721]  Says, I am a terrorist, close quote.
[00:08:41.102 --> 00:08:42.043]  Involved in terrorism.
[00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:47.864]  Twitter blocks Alex Jones for calling for violence on the media.
[00:08:48.264 --> 00:08:49.405]  Antifa and the Chi-Coms.
[00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:50.945]  They only show quotes around each word.
[00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:52.066]  Never said it.
[00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:53.266]  Total poach.
[00:09:00.168 --> 00:09:05.750]  I have top law firms, two of them in the country, saying 100% victories.
[00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.390]  It's open and shut.
[00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.911]  But we're not going to have a country by that.
[00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:13.226]  This is war-level propaganda.
[00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:19.270]  This is beyond what they did to invade Iraq in 2003 with all the fake intelligence.
[00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:22.972]  Because they're not invading Alex Jones.
[00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:24.813]  They're invading the First Amendment in America.
[00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:25.853]  This is their move.
[00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:33.758]  Soros just poured billions into Facebook and into Spotify and others for censoring me.
[00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:46.550]  Which is the payment for them losing all the business they're gonna get when they ban all libertarians, all Christians, all conservatives, and it's been announced by Barry Diller, it's been announced by News Corp, they're involved, now split off.
[00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.890]  It's here.
[00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.451]  It's here.
[00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:52.072]  This is the maximum alert.
[00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:55.773]  Now remember, I'm gonna lay all this out at the bottom of the hour in detail, but remember.
[00:09:58.253 --> 00:10:04.435]  Within hours of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Bill Clinton, in fact, I think it's even on YouTube still,
[00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:11.849]  And Janet Reno then gave a press conference that night saying Rush Limbaugh caused the bombing.
[00:10:14.353 --> 00:10:18.639]  The Republicans were going to win the House and the Senate.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.381]  Bill Clinton was going to lose.
[00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:22.710]  In fact, I forgot to print that.
[00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.011]  I need that at the bottom of the hour as an exhibit.
[00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:28.875]  Type in Bill Clinton credits, 96 re-election, Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:10:28.915 --> 00:10:32.258]  You may have to click web or click images that we print out, like USA Today.
[00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:33.039]  I need that.
[00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:35.581]  I'm going to put this whole exhibit on here at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.682]  That's why they want me off air.
[00:10:37.122 --> 00:10:42.787]  They want me off air before they carry this out.
[00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:43.808]  Now, I'm going to explain something.
[00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:45.430]  I've talked to a lot of sources.
[00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.471]  They concur with my analysis.
[00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:47.792]  This is my analysis, though.
[00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:54.632]  Remember, I was able to predict the World Trade Center attack in 2001, two months before it happened, with total precision.
[00:10:56.893 --> 00:11:03.357]  They are going to stage these events, and they were planning to de-platform me when they staged the event.
[00:11:04.378 --> 00:11:16.206]  But they knew when I started saying a couple of weeks ago, not just the CHICOM info, but about how I believe they were pairing a false flag, and I was talking about stelter in the media and these newspapers, saying Trump's going to cause violence, and that Trump needs to understand that.
[00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:27.512]  And they know for a fact, I've been trying to get that information to Trump, that they just said, listen, we can't have this guy up there on all these platforms before we pull this off.
[00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:36.255]  So, you need to call the White House, you need to call Congress, you need to do it every day, every hour, you need to call talk radio, C-SPAN, everywhere.
[00:11:37.376 --> 00:11:42.638]  Just like I said on July 25th, 2001, the audience wasn't that big then, Amazon maybe
[00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:47.677]  100 radio stations and local TV.
[00:11:47.877 --> 00:11:50.740]  I need everybody to understand this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:52.761 --> 00:12:00.127]  They built me up into this giant boogeyman, thinking it would get Trump unelected, where he wouldn't get elected.
[00:12:01.128 --> 00:12:03.810]  Now they think he won't get re-elected, but it's beyond that.
[00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.913]  They're gonna make their move, and that's why they ran the hoax today.
[00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:13.097]  I get up at 5 a.m., type my name in, you know, getting ready to be punched in the stomach.
[00:12:13.137 --> 00:12:13.998]  It's always some new lie.
[00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:17.694]  But it's worth it for the country and my children.
[00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:23.896]  And it's Alex Jones' pirate radio station rated $15,000 fine.
[00:12:24.136 --> 00:12:29.577]  And I read the AP, and then I go to The Hill.
[00:12:29.677 --> 00:12:30.698]  They lied even worse.
[00:12:30.718 --> 00:12:35.159]  They said, Alex Jones' radio station.
[00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:37.359]  We don't broadcast on TV or radio.
[00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:39.080]  We have satellite uplinks.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.700]  The satellites are totally legal and lawful.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.381]  We also have fiber optics that shares the show.
[00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:47.510]  Anybody running a station knows that.
[00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:53.794]  This is put out to create the idea that now my broadcast, now my radio show itself is illegal.
[00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:58.937]  And you'll read the Facebook comments on CBS's story, just one I looked at, of thousands, and it says, good!
[00:12:58.978 --> 00:12:59.798]  Take him off the air!
[00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:00.899]  Arrest him!
[00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:03.120]  They are getting their mob wound up.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.085]  The idea that Alex Jones has an illegal radio station, Alex Jones is taken off the air in an FCC raid, and then I read the article,
[00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.771]  And I knew the hoax was even worse than that.
[00:13:18.012 --> 00:13:33.642]  They admit in the AP, so this was done on purpose, that at some station you can't even hear for a half mile, I didn't even know it was there, anybody could buy one of these kits I guess online, probably thousands of these around the country carrying different things, nobody knows.
[00:13:35.803 --> 00:13:41.407]  And so they put this out to have the illusion that I'm running an illegal radio station and that my offices are illegal and criminal.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:54.706]  And I'm telling you right now that they're going to try to parlay that and to cook that into some type of raid on us to try to actually shut down the broadcast.
[00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:59.308]  I mean, I remember over the years, there have been a bunch of groups that have run different stuff.
[00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:05.091]  And I've been at gun shows and stuff, you know, 10 years ago, I shook somebody's hand saying, oh, I'm running you on this, or I'm running you on a half watt that.
[00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.132]  And I'm like, oh, really?
[00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:06.812]  Where can I hear that?
[00:14:06.832 --> 00:14:09.814]  And I'd kind of drive around sometimes to never really pick it up.
[00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:17.931]  And I believe in the First Amendment, and I believe when corporate stations don't serve the people, people have a right to have micros, what they call pirates.
[00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:26.914]  But they now, imagine waking up, and you hear you're running, quote, an illegal radio station, and there's a $15,000 fine, and it's Alex Jones, and it's his flagship.
[00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.115]  I don't even know it exists.
[00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:30.496]  I asked the office, I was like, has anybody ever heard of this?
[00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.096]  They said, no.
[00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.716]  Years ago, there were stations.
[00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:37.078]  I go, yeah, like two, three years ago, there was a station up for a while, you could hear every once in a while.
[00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:52.830]  Like 90.1 or something, so that's how crazy this is, folks, is that they're on the news saying it's illegal broadcast, raided by the federal government, $15,000 fine, when we're on over 200 radio stations, approaching 300.
[00:14:54.011 --> 00:15:01.756]  On our satellites, big ones, little ones, you name it, we're on 400 plus UHF, VHF TV stations, over 100 cable stations.
[00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:04.939]  We probably signed 50 agreements last week.
[00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:08.401]  I've got a stack of liners and promos I'm supposed to cut for stations.
[00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:09.202]  I'm way behind.
[00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:11.763]  We have stations knocking down our doors.
[00:15:11.783 --> 00:15:16.226]  We just met with broadcast stations two days ago in Houston at a big meeting.
[00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:21.410]  That's why they're pissed, because they wanted to kill Sinclair's deal to put Patriot stuff on TV, and they have.
[00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:23.678]  Sinclair's expansion.
[00:15:23.698 --> 00:15:25.380]  They run these lies that I'm on Sinclair.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:25.861]  I'm not.
[00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:29.265]  Total hoax.
[00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:31.527]  Never been on a Sinclair radio station.
[00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.531]  Which is another group.
[00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:36.473]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:15:36.593 --> 00:15:38.195]  So, it's a total hoax.
[00:15:38.956 --> 00:15:40.638]  I don't know the people running that station.
[00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:45.319]  No one could ever hear it, so it must have been like a half watt or something, or like a block.
[00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:50.903]  So now they can just put up stations with half a watt, say I've done it, and announce I'm a criminal all over the news.
[00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:55.967]  This is the plan concerted effort ahead of silencing us ahead of the giant false flag.
[00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.509]  It could happen in days, weeks, or months, but it's coming.
[00:15:58.809 --> 00:15:59.310]  It's coming.
[00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:09.560]  There was some bad news recently for extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist and bath salt spokesmodel Alex Jones.
[00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:15.028]  Because it looks like his website InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:17.311]  Yesterday...
[00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.093]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:22.994]  I think the things he says are awful.
[00:16:23.014 --> 00:16:24.175]  He makes me physically sick.
[00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:26.736]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president.
[00:16:26.936 --> 00:16:28.738]  And he has six million people that listen to him.
[00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.740]  And I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.181]  We have a problem in this country.
[00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:35.902]  And I would like him to be exposed.
[00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:39.865]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[00:16:40.005 --> 00:16:42.487]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[00:16:42.547 --> 00:16:46.009]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:48.010]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:16:49.772 --> 00:16:58.245]  Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:02.409]  They're gone.
[00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:03.430]  They're out of there.
[00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:18.909]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers, alleging that these were merely, that these were actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:20.551]  David Hogg, a day after the event,
[00:17:21.072 --> 00:17:25.876]  I started working for the Democratic Party in Soros, flying around on private jets, being anti-gun spokesperson.
[00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:35.784]  I said he's a PR man, and that he was an actor at the school, part of the drama club, so he's well-spoken, and he's been chosen to be anti-gun.
[00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:38.767]  I said I believe people died, and I believe he's a real student.
[00:17:39.087 --> 00:17:44.388]  But they misrepresented and said that I bullied him and said that nobody died, even though he's a public figure.
[00:17:44.668 --> 00:17:45.708]  I would have a right to say that.
[00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:46.509]  I didn't say that.
[00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:55.790]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:07.513]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack happened and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy.
[00:18:07.933 --> 00:18:09.795]  I did not post a video doing that.
[00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.276]  It was all over the news.
[00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:12.898]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:17.963]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I'd said that I didn't say it.
[00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:28.413]  And you got your asses kicked because I had InfoWars.com and I had NewsWars.com and I was able to counter and show what I said.
[00:18:28.473 --> 00:18:30.575]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:18:31.448 --> 00:18:38.796]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:46.945]  Our reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:49.828]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:51.750]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:56.352]  Like, you know, good friends, family... Well, like you said, CNN's not calling anymore.
[00:18:56.452 --> 00:19:02.494]  And I say, well, you know, tell me, if you're so... you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:08.597]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, and they'll send me a link to some other article saying, paraphrasing what you said.
[00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:11.058]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[00:19:11.438 --> 00:19:15.059]  And when I go find it, and I say, well, that's not really what was said here.
[00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:17.540]  Well, then, you know, then there's this back pedal.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.861]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[00:19:21.081 --> 00:19:24.282]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions.
[00:19:24.802 --> 00:19:27.242]  All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones.
[00:19:27.723 --> 00:19:31.363]  Because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:36.605]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:19:36.725 --> 00:19:37.525]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:38.485]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:39.525]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.485]  Infowars.
[00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:41.326]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:42.426]  From Infowars.
[00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:43.026]  Infowars.
[00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:49.191]  I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:19:49.692 --> 00:19:53.575]  But he's got a point of view and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:59.100]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him, prevent him from speaking.
[00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:07.868]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:44.331]  All right.
[00:20:45.632 --> 00:20:50.795]  I have never had this many butterflies in my chest on air in 24 years.
[00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:56.779]  I can speak to a group of 10,000 people, auditorium, and not have any butterflies.
[00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:58.560]  I'm a pretty confident guy.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.082]  I can walk over to a beautiful woman when I wasn't married or whatever and ask her out and be calm about it.
[00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:08.606]  I could be ready to get in a fist fight with somebody starting a fight with me back in those days and I didn't have anxiety.
[00:21:08.626 --> 00:21:10.206]  But let me tell you something right now.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.062]  The anxiety I have is not personal fear.
[00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:24.753]  It's that I'm not going to execute this properly and lay this out properly to you because this is the whole future of the country, the Trump revolution, our children, Christianity, free market, everything.
[00:21:24.773 --> 00:21:28.296]  These people trying to take over are really, really, really bad.
[00:21:28.316 --> 00:21:30.478]  So I'm going to try not to break down too.
[00:21:30.738 --> 00:21:33.881]  And the reason I start crying at these moments is the emotions are so strong.
[00:21:34.702 --> 00:22:03.746]  How much I love my family, how much I love you, and how bad these people are, and how evil they are, and the clutch of lies that they've had on us for so long, and what they're doing to our children, how they're brainwashing our children, how they're trying to screw them up psychologically, how they've got 30% of the population on psychotropics, and everywhere you go, you've gone from 1 in 30,000 with autism to 1 in 58, and there's just brain-damaged children everywhere, and it's all by design, it's all declassified, and it's just such a horrible eugenics program,
[00:22:04.486 --> 00:22:12.269]  That's 5,000 times bigger, conservatively, than something like Tuskegee secretly injecting black people with syphilis.
[00:22:13.649 --> 00:22:14.909]  And it's just all coming out.
[00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.851]  And it's every day a new lie.
[00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.612]  If you've been in broadcast radio, like I have been for 23 years.
[00:22:23.812 --> 00:22:25.913]  Started out on AXS TV my first year, 24 years ago, in 1995.
[00:22:25.953 --> 00:22:27.753]  But got on local radio in 1996.
[00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:38.033]  You know about the FCC, about transmitters, about cue tones, about all of it.
[00:22:39.593 --> 00:22:41.774]  And then to get up this morning, I'm just gonna tell the story now.
[00:22:42.574 --> 00:22:44.075]  It's illustrative of everything else I'm saying.
[00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:46.875]  Just a microcosm of the tapestry of lies.
[00:22:48.876 --> 00:23:01.999]  And 5 a.m., I get up, get a glass of water, walk out on the back porch, type in my name into an iPad, and it's Alex Jones's flagship pirate radio station rated.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.380]  I'm like, are there even pirates in Austin anymore?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.521]  It's been two, three years since I even heard one.
[00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:13.522]  There was like punk rock ones and religious ones and, you know, it's crazy.
[00:23:14.202 --> 00:23:15.622]  And yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:23.283]  There have been groups out there that have... All over the country, I get calls from stations that we say, well, what's your call letters?
[00:23:23.343 --> 00:23:24.284]  Oh, it's not a call letter.
[00:23:24.304 --> 00:23:27.644]  Some guy's got a, you know, micro up on the mountain here in Colorado.
[00:23:27.684 --> 00:23:28.824]  I can hear it for 20 miles.
[00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:31.525]  So,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.581]  This is part of the American fabric.
[00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:35.882]  It's an uncivil thing.
[00:23:35.922 --> 00:23:36.782]  You can get fines for it.
[00:23:37.442 --> 00:23:38.523]  But we're not involved in it.
[00:23:38.563 --> 00:23:39.544]  We don't broadcast.
[00:23:39.604 --> 00:23:41.965]  We don't have TV stations, radio stations.
[00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:43.426]  We are a provider.
[00:23:43.446 --> 00:23:44.707]  We have satellite uplinks.
[00:23:46.407 --> 00:23:50.570]  Our fiber optic goes to another place in Austin with satellite uplinks.
[00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:56.745]  And then those go to satellites, legally and lawfully, and we pay tens of thousands of dollars a month to do that.
[00:23:56.785 --> 00:24:00.648]  That's from our building up to space, and then back down to the planet.
[00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:02.390]  We don't have radio transmitters.
[00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:07.394]  We don't even have a walkie-talkie system on the building that we could have, which I thought might be good for us.
[00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.216]  You can get those, you know, easily.
[00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:11.377]  They go a few miles or whatever.
[00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:13.839]  But just think about that.
[00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:14.400]  You get up.
[00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:18.314]  You're drinking a glass of water, making coffee, walking on the back porch.
[00:24:19.014 --> 00:24:20.675]  All right, let me see Alex Jones.
[00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:21.595]  Get ready to get hit in the stomach.
[00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:22.175]  Boom!
[00:24:22.195 --> 00:24:25.236]  You know, it's a lie per day or more.
[00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:31.918]  And I'm like, I read the names of the people, never heard of them, because, you know, going back 10 years ago or so, I'd be at a gun show.
[00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:34.599]  Somebody would say, hey, I'm running you on, whatever, two watts.
[00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:35.780]  He goes out five miles.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.200]  I'm like, wow.
[00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:38.571]  Interesting, great.
[00:24:38.591 --> 00:24:41.572]  You know, those empty spaces on the frequency line.
[00:24:41.592 --> 00:24:42.372]  I don't know these people.
[00:24:42.392 --> 00:24:49.233]  You know, a lot of folks have bemoaned the fact that it's been years since we could even hear any of these pirates in Austin.
[00:24:49.253 --> 00:24:51.333]  And I've been on different stations here in Austin that are commercial.
[00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:54.974]  We're on 50,000 watt stations across the country.
[00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:59.195]  We're on stations that are licensed stations that cover whole multi-states.
[00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:03.495]  So the idea behind this is all crafted and all planned.
[00:25:04.075 --> 00:25:04.896]  And then I read the article.
[00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:06.736]  It said that the
[00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:16.705]  Low-powered station that only went like a mile or something hadn't been on since last year, and that there was an FCC letter sent to him.
[00:25:18.846 --> 00:25:21.668]  So now, Alex Jones' flagship station taken off.
[00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:22.868]  I didn't even know it's on.
[00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:23.949]  I don't know who it is.
[00:25:23.969 --> 00:25:25.669]  I don't even know if I was really on it.
[00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.311]  It's crazy.
[00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:34.580]  And that is a microcosm of how they lie, because you go to CBS News everywhere, it's, screw you, Jones.
[00:25:35.741 --> 00:25:37.062]  Me and Frigier were reading it in his office.
[00:25:37.362 --> 00:25:39.384]  I asked him to bring over the quotes, because I wanted to read them.
[00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:41.626]  It's like, good, take your criminal show off the air.
[00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:42.888]  I knew it was illegal!
[00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:47.151]  And it's all done knowing the public doesn't know how radio and TV networks work.
[00:25:49.494 --> 00:25:50.294]  They don't know how it works.
[00:25:50.354 --> 00:25:52.597]  So they hear, Alex Jones hit with $15,000 fine.
[00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:52.997]  No, it's a hoax!
[00:25:55.632 --> 00:26:06.301]  It's a total and complete hoax, but it's to put out there that I'm illegal, that I'm bad, that I'm doing terrible things, that I've got to be shut down, that I'm this terrible villain.
[00:26:07.242 --> 00:26:08.523]  Alex Jones is mean to children.
[00:26:08.623 --> 00:26:09.764]  Alex Jones is a terrorist.
[00:26:10.084 --> 00:26:11.646]  Alex Jones has illegal radio stations.
[00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:13.227]  Alex Jones' show is illegal.
[00:26:13.668 --> 00:26:18.111]  I've never had one FCC action on me in 23 years on radio.
[00:26:23.223 --> 00:26:27.505]  Twice we've missed cuss words that went out, but there was never any FCC action.
[00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:36.110]  We have never had an FCC case or issue, and I've been on there 24 years and there aren't many people that can say that.
[00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.811]  People complain about everything.
[00:26:37.831 --> 00:26:38.211]  24 years.
[00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:39.292]  23 and a half.
[00:26:47.151 --> 00:26:52.095]  FCC Chairman Pye defends crackdown on pirate radio station broadcasting Alex Jones.
[00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:54.136]  What is Pye weighing in on this?
[00:26:55.097 --> 00:26:55.617]  Print me that.
[00:26:55.657 --> 00:26:58.639]  Like, this is some station that I couldn't even hear.
[00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:00.581]  I didn't even know about.
[00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:04.664]  And it's a big national issue because now all the corporate guys get their cover.
[00:27:05.004 --> 00:27:09.768]  Well, even the conservative FCC head defends the crackdown on the Alex Jones station.
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.191]  He said, we will always follow the law.
[00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:17.732]  It's a station used by Alex Jones.
[00:27:18.153 --> 00:27:25.178]  So that means if those stations picked up anything off a satellite, thousands of feeds, they're all guilty too.
[00:27:25.398 --> 00:27:27.900]  But I never heard it to even know if I was on it!
[00:27:29.298 --> 00:27:30.719]  That's the next level deception.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.361]  That's the next level lies.
[00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:35.143]  And it's every day, something new, a new lie.
[00:27:35.643 --> 00:27:42.489]  I say, wow, Antifa in these videos just said they're coming with firearms to kill members of Congress, President Trump, and talk show hosts and others.
[00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.032]  Everybody better get their battle rifles ready at their homes for self-defense.
[00:27:46.313 --> 00:27:46.893]  That's the quote.
[00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:51.277]  But Twitter says if we play it, they'll ban us.
[00:27:51.497 --> 00:27:54.740]  So only Media Matters can show the quote, but then no one else actually plays the quote.
[00:27:55.979 --> 00:28:01.764]  It's a 20-something minute transmission, and it's about chi-coms have taken over the government, taken over Hollywood.
[00:28:02.184 --> 00:28:03.625]  Antifa says they're coming to attack you.
[00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:07.608]  We need Trump to legally and lawfully, through the criminal justice system, come after him.
[00:28:07.628 --> 00:28:12.412]  That turns into, quote, we need to criminally, with battle rifles, go after the media.
[00:28:12.512 --> 00:28:13.132]  Never said that!
[00:28:14.233 --> 00:28:22.379]  That's what Lester Holt and MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times... And again, the fraud level is like 20, 30 times whatever it was.
[00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:25.282]  They've gone pure fraud, and they wouldn't be doing this
[00:28:26.645 --> 00:28:29.304]  If they weren't planning something ultra-massive.
[00:28:30.356 --> 00:28:31.036]  And what are they saying?
[00:28:31.136 --> 00:28:33.958]  Trump and Alex Jones are going to cause violence against us in the media.
[00:28:34.618 --> 00:28:35.919]  That's their re-election bid.
[00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:37.540]  That's how they make themselves the victims.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.223]  Try to bring in the midterms, impeach Trump, shut down all of his support, all the pro-Americana people, and roll out.
[00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:46.985]  As they cover up all the Antifa stuff.
[00:28:47.045 --> 00:28:47.745]  Oh, and get the clip.
[00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:50.426]  As Governor Cuomo says, America was never great.
[00:28:51.087 --> 00:28:52.728]  These people hate America.
[00:28:52.768 --> 00:28:53.528]  But you can stop them.
[00:28:53.788 --> 00:28:55.149]  The live feeds are on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:59.131]  I want to thank DrudgeReport.com for being the only place that put my Lester Holt response out.
[00:29:01.496 --> 00:29:02.417]  We knew it was coming.
[00:29:02.437 --> 00:29:04.020]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:17.559]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:29:20.486 --> 00:29:20.526]  No.
[00:29:51.026 --> 00:29:54.547]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines.
[00:29:55.088 --> 00:29:58.929]  Which again, is something out of 1984 or a Kothka novel.
[00:29:59.129 --> 00:30:01.430]  Where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.990]  You can't face your accuser.
[00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:08.512]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[00:30:09.636 --> 00:30:23.342]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:28.624]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[00:30:29.304 --> 00:30:31.925]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[00:30:32.305 --> 00:30:36.047]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:38.114]  And that, of course, is iTunes.
[00:30:38.534 --> 00:30:45.199]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:53.664]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[00:30:54.265 --> 00:30:59.808]  The bigger issue is they don't like info wars exposing the fact in great detail.
[00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:13.254]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[00:31:13.534 --> 00:31:15.134]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[00:31:15.214 --> 00:31:17.555]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[00:31:17.995 --> 00:31:27.259]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:38.423]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War of, you know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[00:31:39.003 --> 00:31:44.866]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply
[00:31:45.726 --> 00:31:48.327]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:31:48.747 --> 00:31:50.168]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[00:31:50.628 --> 00:31:51.448]  Just click on the link.
[00:31:51.668 --> 00:31:54.629]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:06.674]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[00:32:07.354 --> 00:32:11.136]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:32:11.616 --> 00:32:14.498]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:19.922]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:21.464]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:32:21.864 --> 00:32:22.484]  You're an adult.
[00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:24.826]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[00:32:25.146 --> 00:32:29.790]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:31.651]  InfoWars.com.
[00:32:31.932 --> 00:32:32.792]  NewsWars.com.
[00:32:33.012 --> 00:32:34.113]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:34.674]  Listen.
[00:32:35.512 --> 00:32:37.113]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:32:37.253 --> 00:32:40.896]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:41.917]  We've been very successful.
[00:32:42.397 --> 00:32:43.578]  I've expected to be attacked.
[00:32:43.598 --> 00:32:47.021]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[00:32:47.501 --> 00:32:52.345]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[00:32:52.665 --> 00:33:00.612]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:09.307]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.164]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:28.644 --> 00:33:30.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.112 --> 00:33:46.415]  If you just joined us, I'm going to lay out the most important information that we have ever broke down.
[00:33:47.335 --> 00:33:49.076]  Not just for America, but for the planet.
[00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:53.497]  This information persists of the globalist enemy plan.
[00:33:57.256 --> 00:34:13.741]  Turn the election into midterms for the Democrats and then abolish the First Amendment bringing in draconian free speech controls in America that Senator Warner and Senator Murphy admit they're doing and we have their own admitted plans that leaked two weeks ago that they admit are real.
[00:34:15.022 --> 00:34:18.323]  Since then they've gone public saying we will silence all conservatives.
[00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:22.304]  Governor Cuomo has come out and said America was never that great.
[00:34:24.085 --> 00:34:24.905]  These are globalists.
[00:34:26.172 --> 00:34:28.594]  They are the enemy of the American people.
[00:34:30.576 --> 00:34:35.680]  They literally unveiled their new slogan, America was never that great.
[00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:53.076]  They're putting out disinfo articles about us everywhere, lies about us, that we got criminally raided yesterday over an illegal radio station that I literally didn't even know was operating, and it turns out wasn't operating,
[00:34:54.758 --> 00:34:59.201]  They say it was off last December and I didn't even know they had pirates in Austin for years.
[00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:02.302]  Because they were so low power.
[00:35:03.403 --> 00:35:06.745]  But that's what they're doing ahead of the big event.
[00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:13.349]  Now I pulled together a lot of these articles and I put together the evidence of what's going to unfold.
[00:35:19.753 --> 00:35:21.414]  Can I ask you a favor and close the second door please?
[00:35:22.628 --> 00:35:24.569]  But I'm not even up to doing this at this point.
[00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.649]  I'm going to have to do it next segment.
[00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:36.053]  This is just so monstrous, so complete, that if I just get caught up in the minutiae and proving every point of it, it won't be the announcement I need to make.
[00:35:36.413 --> 00:35:43.276]  Because unlike mainstream media, where they just say, Alex Jones says, use your battle rifles on mainstream media, and then they don't show where I said it.
[00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:45.997]  If I'm going to say it, I'm going to show it.
[00:35:48.134 --> 00:35:54.179]  I've got the New York Times right here where Bill Clinton said he won re-election in 96 because of Oklahoma City.
[00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:59.142]  I need to highlight that part when I do the presentation.
[00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:01.024]  I just need to put that out.
[00:36:01.044 --> 00:36:02.285]  So you guys take this and highlight that.
[00:36:02.965 --> 00:36:11.312]  And then I've got all the letters and all the facts and all the documents and I've got mainstream corporate media saying I'm a terrorist, CNN.
[00:36:15.245 --> 00:36:19.189]  I have just got unbelievable information here that we're going to have to go over in the next segment.
[00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:21.332]  And I'm going to try my best.
[00:36:21.352 --> 00:36:25.236]  I'm going to try my very, very, very, very best.
[00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:33.084]  But I'm going to have to get some focus in here first.
[00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:38.536]  Before I do this, because make no mistake, they're getting ready to make their move.
[00:36:38.576 --> 00:36:42.619]  They wouldn't be engaged in propaganda of this magnitude if that wasn't the case.
[00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:45.220]  Guys, can I have a video list, please?
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.820]  Thank you.
[00:36:52.964 --> 00:36:59.348]  All I can say to the listeners is, is that everybody better get their act together right now.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:09.225]  And everybody better get serious because we're not just going to take the country back from the globalists and then have this situation be easy.
[00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:11.567]  This is going to be hard.
[00:37:12.628 --> 00:37:17.371]  This is going to be serious and this is going to be hard fought politically and the enemy's going to try to make it physical.
[00:37:18.992 --> 00:37:29.740]  But there's no doubt they're getting ready to carry out a large false flag against themselves, mainstream media, the Democrats, big tech companies to make themselves the victims.
[00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:41.669]  Soros admits he did this just a few years ago in Ukraine, where they staged attacks on the populace to get it launched against the elected government to overthrow it.
[00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:46.453]  So, we're going to be going over all of that when we come back from break.
[00:37:47.514 --> 00:37:55.440]  All I can tell you is, if it wasn't for DrudgeReport.com, put DrudgeReport.com on screen please, and go over to the left-hand side, he had it at the top last night and this morning.
[00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:03.252]  That I responded to Lester Holt and others and said, you are a liar.
[00:38:05.253 --> 00:38:08.435]  Show where I said, use battle rifles on the media, the chi-coms.
[00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:16.258]  I said, if Antifa comes to your house, and I played the video of them saying, we're coming to kill Republicans at their houses, you should have your rifle ready to protect yourself.
[00:38:17.279 --> 00:38:26.503]  And for that, Jack Dorsey banned me on Twitter for seven days, and then went on the show with Holt and said, yes, he saw me say all these things I didn't say.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.881]  You can just see where this is going.
[00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:33.282]  We all have no voice.
[00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:50.232]  And so now they're taking some pirate microstations, what they're called, that I don't even know existed, that closed in December, according to even the news has a footnote, and then they say that I'm running a legal station and got raided by the feds.
[00:38:50.452 --> 00:38:51.833]  There was no raid by feds.
[00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:53.114]  There was no station.
[00:38:54.114 --> 00:39:00.058]  They sent them an FCC letter, and now that's national news that some microstation
[00:39:01.561 --> 00:39:02.982]  That you can buy for a kit for like $200.
[00:39:03.923 --> 00:39:06.705]  I know it was weak because I haven't heard any of those stations in years.
[00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:12.370]  Ten years ago, I interviewed a guy running one in Austin that was strong up on a hill.
[00:39:13.491 --> 00:39:16.793]  It was a former sheriff, Frank.
[00:39:18.875 --> 00:39:21.117]  And I was on hundreds of stations at that time.
[00:39:21.157 --> 00:39:23.679]  So, you know, micros, I know we're on them, they're getting out.
[00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:26.661]  As long as they don't interfere with the commercial stations, I'm happy they're there.
[00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.652]  It's an old American pastime, everybody knows.
[00:39:30.133 --> 00:39:31.595]  The left has them in a lot of big cities.
[00:39:32.716 --> 00:39:34.138]  Those don't really get messed with.
[00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:40.646]  But he was getting messed with, and I remember telling him when he came on, I said, well, you're an old guy, your wife just died.
[00:39:42.677 --> 00:39:44.719]  Why don't you go ahead and turn this sucker off?
[00:39:44.839 --> 00:39:46.720]  I don't need you to have this station running for me.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.702]  And he said, no, because he was running a bunch of other stuff.
[00:39:48.722 --> 00:39:51.104]  He goes, oh, I run 60 minutes programs.
[00:39:51.144 --> 00:39:52.405]  I like plugged in the TV.
[00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:55.427]  But he lived in the hills outside town.
[00:39:55.467 --> 00:39:58.229]  So it covered part of the like half the city a little bit.
[00:39:58.249 --> 00:40:00.071]  I mean, if you were in your car, you could hear it.
[00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:01.672]  But you still kind of I mean.
[00:40:03.755 --> 00:40:07.097]  I was already listening to an iPod or whatever 10 years ago in my car.
[00:40:07.217 --> 00:40:11.859]  I just don't listen to really a lot of local radio unless it's the affiliate I'm on.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:17.062]  And 590 is what we were on back at that time, which is the number one talk station in Central Texas.
[00:40:18.323 --> 00:40:20.784]  And we're on a bunch of other stations in Texas that are commercial stations.
[00:40:20.824 --> 00:40:27.388]  So I don't want them saying I'm running illegal radio stations to distract off the big news I'm about to cover.
[00:40:29.235 --> 00:40:30.196]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:40:30.817 --> 00:40:35.361]  But I'm just saying it's an example of every day the hoaxes that I'm doing something illegal.
[00:40:35.862 --> 00:40:36.482]  Here's an example.
[00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:41.107]  Antifa attacked me at the RNC.
[00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:42.568]  There's raw video of it online.
[00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.652]  And the police came in to protect me and took me out.
[00:40:47.253 --> 00:40:51.197]  Just type in Alex Jones, protected by police, Cleveland.
[00:40:52.981 --> 00:40:56.442]  2016.
[00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:56.442]  Just show images.
[00:40:57.242 --> 00:40:58.102]  It's all over the news.
[00:40:59.062 --> 00:41:05.104]  And it shows state police with me on each arm, guiding me out, and guys behind me in a protective detail.
[00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:10.085]  Just type in Alex Jones, Police, Cleveland.
[00:41:10.685 --> 00:41:11.986]  Click images, it'll come up.
[00:41:12.206 --> 00:41:14.506]  Alex Jones, protected by Police, Cleveland.
[00:41:15.186 --> 00:41:20.328]  But in the news, they always put the picture up like I'm being arrested.
[00:41:20.428 --> 00:41:21.528]  So it's like, Alex Jones,
[00:41:22.844 --> 00:41:23.724]  I saw a bunch of them today.
[00:41:23.844 --> 00:41:25.465]  Alex Jones raided by the FCC.
[00:41:25.505 --> 00:41:29.647]  Yeah, that's not the photo.
[00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:30.248]  It doesn't matter.
[00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:31.988]  See, I just can't do it anymore.
[00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:34.450]  It's all over the news today.
[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:40.552]  I mean, it's just everywhere with the state police in their kind of Marine Corps hats leading me out.
[00:41:40.572 --> 00:41:41.473]  Everybody's seen it.
[00:41:41.813 --> 00:41:42.393]  We don't need to show it.
[00:41:42.413 --> 00:41:43.074]  It just doesn't matter.
[00:41:43.774 --> 00:41:45.675]  And we do need to get that camera straight, though.
[00:41:46.575 --> 00:41:46.915]  There it is.
[00:41:46.975 --> 00:41:47.496]  That's the photo.
[00:41:48.056 --> 00:41:49.577]  So that's the photo.
[00:41:49.797 --> 00:41:51.798]  They run everywhere, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:56.648]  And they run it like FCC raids Alex Jones's flagship station.
[00:41:56.908 --> 00:41:58.829]  And that's in the news, that picture.
[00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.230]  That I'm going to jail.
[00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:03.933]  And that's the hoax of these dirty lobalists.
[00:42:05.394 --> 00:42:10.178]  So while they're launching all this, they don't want me on air to respond to this.
[00:42:10.218 --> 00:42:11.398]  And it's bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:42:11.418 --> 00:42:12.799]  They're coming for your free speech.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.120]  They're coming for the election.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.261]  They're coming for your guns.
[00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:16.402]  They're coming for your kids.
[00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:17.463]  They're coming for Trump.
[00:42:17.483 --> 00:42:20.385]  So what you can do is what Drudge Report has wisely done.
[00:42:21.837 --> 00:42:22.798]  Thank you for finding it, guys.
[00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:23.539]  Great job.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.726]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:32.773]  Go and get the verboten videos that they don't want you to see and post them on YouTube.
[00:42:33.073 --> 00:42:33.935]  Post them on Facebook.
[00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:35.654]  Download them.
[00:42:35.674 --> 00:42:36.014]  Get them out.
[00:42:36.334 --> 00:42:37.855]  This is going to be a fight for the web.
[00:42:38.075 --> 00:42:43.536]  They're beta testing how to unperson somebody and how to phantom zone somebody on me right now.
[00:42:44.036 --> 00:42:46.037]  Now I'm not going to false start again.
[00:42:46.077 --> 00:42:47.037]  I'm going to just get wound up.
[00:42:47.057 --> 00:42:49.298]  I've just got so much data to go over here.
[00:42:49.318 --> 00:42:50.858]  I need my New York Times article highlighted please.
[00:42:51.798 --> 00:42:57.340]  And I'm going to rampage through this on the other side of what's coming and what's going to happen and how we can stop it.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.861]  This is the most important broadcast probably in U.S.
[00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:00.161]  history.
[00:43:02.216 --> 00:43:10.140]  There was some bad news recently for extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist and bath salt spokesmodel Alex Jones.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.582]  Because it looks like his website InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:43:15.602 --> 00:43:17.883]  Yesterday...
[00:43:19.868 --> 00:43:21.650]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.571]  I think the things he says are awful.
[00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:24.732]  He makes me physically sick.
[00:43:24.792 --> 00:43:33.298]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[00:43:33.358 --> 00:43:36.420]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.363]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[00:43:40.563 --> 00:43:43.044]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[00:43:43.084 --> 00:43:46.745]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:49.506]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:58.829]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.130]  So, if
[00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:02.971]  We're gone.
[00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:03.991]  We're out of there.
[00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:19.475]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers alleging that these were merely, that these were actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[00:44:19.495 --> 00:44:21.096]  David Hogg, a day after the event,
[00:44:21.656 --> 00:44:26.437]  I started working for the Democratic Party in Soros, flying around on private jets, being anti-gun spokesperson.
[00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:36.339]  I said he's a PR man, and that he was an actor at the school, part of the drama club, so he's well-spoken, and he's been chosen to be anti-gun.
[00:44:36.379 --> 00:44:39.219]  I said I believe people died, and I believe he's a real student.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.961]  But they misrepresented it and said that I bullied him, and said that nobody died, even though he's a public figure.
[00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:46.281]  I would have a right to say that.
[00:44:46.421 --> 00:44:47.101]  I didn't say that.
[00:44:47.721 --> 00:44:56.367]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[00:44:56.387 --> 00:45:08.174]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack happened and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy.
[00:45:08.514 --> 00:45:10.376]  I did not post a video doing that.
[00:45:10.736 --> 00:45:11.837]  It was all over the news.
[00:45:12.137 --> 00:45:13.458]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[00:45:14.238 --> 00:45:18.540]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I'd said that I didn't say it.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:28.963]  And you got your asses kicked because I had InfoWars.com and I had NewsWars.com and I was able to counter and show what I said.
[00:45:29.023 --> 00:45:31.284]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:39.373]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[00:45:39.533 --> 00:45:47.515]  A reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[00:45:47.615 --> 00:45:50.376]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[00:45:50.556 --> 00:45:52.317]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[00:45:53.237 --> 00:45:54.737]  Like, you know, good friends, family.
[00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:56.698]  Well, like you said, CNN's not calling anymore.
[00:45:57.018 --> 00:46:03.059]  And I say, well, you know, tell me, if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:09.121]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, and they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:11.602]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:15.703]  And when I go find it, I say, well, that's not really what was said here.
[00:46:15.743 --> 00:46:18.103]  Well, then, you know, then there's like this back pedal.
[00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:21.424]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[00:46:21.644 --> 00:46:31.914]  Well, it's easy to dismiss concerns about Big Tech's actions, all coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones, because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[00:46:31.974 --> 00:46:37.180]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.201]  Alex Jones.
[00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:39.081]  Alex Jones.
[00:46:39.262 --> 00:46:40.343]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:40.423 --> 00:46:41.043]  Infowars.
[00:46:41.124 --> 00:46:41.864]  Alex Jones.
[00:46:42.104 --> 00:46:43.005]  From Infowars.
[00:46:43.186 --> 00:46:43.586]  Infowars.
[00:46:43.706 --> 00:46:49.747]  I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:46:50.247 --> 00:46:54.148]  But he's got a point of view and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[00:46:54.168 --> 00:46:59.649]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him, prevent him from speaking.
[00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:07.311]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:27.685]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:03.834 --> 00:48:05.295]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[00:48:06.395 --> 00:48:07.635]  They think you're not paying attention.
[00:48:08.496 --> 00:48:22.041]  They launch their operations with huge PR rollouts, with psychological preparation, or what one law enforcement friend of mine called tactical brainwashing.
[00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:29.764]  They have been building me up for the last two years as the most evil person on earth.
[00:48:30.592 --> 00:48:38.579]  With lie after lie and hundreds of thousands of news articles, thousands of TV news programs, highly edited for deception.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.864]  Now they're saying I'm calling for people to use battle rifles on the mainstream media.
[00:48:46.346 --> 00:48:54.453]  They're claiming Trump's gonna have blood on his hands anytime because he's calling for violence against the media and then they show no proof.
[00:48:56.806 --> 00:49:02.911]  Now hundreds and hundreds of newspapers have published front page editorials saying Trump's going to cause violence against the media.
[00:49:03.371 --> 00:49:04.352]  We're poor victims.
[00:49:06.814 --> 00:49:16.102]  They're running pieces saying that I'm calling for violence and then they're running fake pieces saying I'm running illegal radio stations and my broadcast has been taken off the air in Austin, raided by the feds.
[00:49:16.322 --> 00:49:17.223]  There was no raid.
[00:49:17.443 --> 00:49:18.684]  There is no illegal station.
[00:49:18.924 --> 00:49:19.905]  It's a total hoax.
[00:49:24.622 --> 00:49:28.727]  For them to tell lies this big means they're about to go for broke.
[00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:41.702]  Now you have to understand, the Clintons and the very same Soros globalists, Mueller, the Deputy Attorney General at the time, later became Obama's Attorney General,
[00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.251]  He was involved in Oklahoma City.
[00:49:44.672 --> 00:49:48.075]  I interviewed the police officers, the widows, the witnesses, people in the buildings.
[00:49:48.555 --> 00:49:50.777]  Oklahoma City was an inside job.
[00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:52.919]  Bombs inside, truck bomb outside.
[00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:55.581]  Run out of Elohim City, controlled by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:49:55.941 --> 00:50:00.865]  We have the receipts of the FBI and the ATF and German intelligence at the local La Quinta.
[00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:02.447]  World Net Daily broke it all.
[00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:03.948]  Came out in federal lawsuits.
[00:50:04.869 --> 00:50:06.350]  Witnesses saw them planting the bombs.
[00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.091]  They said, what is that?
[00:50:07.131 --> 00:50:08.052]  They said, oh, it's butter.
[00:50:09.032 --> 00:50:09.513]  Gray butter.
[00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:12.650]  to people that were in the building.
[00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.472]  They have done this before.
[00:50:18.512 --> 00:50:22.534]  They were going to lose the election in 1996.
[00:50:23.234 --> 00:50:26.175]  They were down 10 to 15 points in all the real polls.
[00:50:26.536 --> 00:50:28.136]  There was going to be a total political realignment.
[00:50:28.336 --> 00:50:29.657]  They were going to reject globalism.
[00:50:30.933 --> 00:50:33.695]  They just lost the House and Senate because of the gun control.
[00:50:34.015 --> 00:50:34.995]  What were they going to do?
[00:50:35.596 --> 00:50:44.340]  Bill Clinton a year later on Air Force One to the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, it's credited everywhere, credited his re-election to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:50:46.842 --> 00:50:47.102]  Why?
[00:50:47.402 --> 00:51:00.349]  Because within hours of the attack, Bill Clinton put out a press release and so did Janet Reno saying Rush Limbaugh and talk radio were the cause of making people hate the federal government.
[00:51:03.015 --> 00:51:03.836]  Fast forward 23 years.
[00:51:03.856 --> 00:51:07.623]  24 years.
[00:51:16.846 --> 00:51:19.187]  And they're doing the same thing everywhere.
[00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:26.191]  You don't think NBC doesn't think about running a story saying, I'm calling for people to attack the media with battle rifles and not show a clip?
[00:51:26.612 --> 00:51:33.055]  Or not even show these fake articles where they take one word and one word and one word and put it in quotes to make up something fake?
[00:51:35.617 --> 00:51:37.338]  Thousands of publications running that?
[00:51:38.368 --> 00:51:41.270]  I had family calling this morning saying, did you get raided by the feds?
[00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:42.490]  Were you running an illegal radio station?
[00:51:42.771 --> 00:51:43.851]  And I'm like, no, it's a hoax.
[00:51:43.891 --> 00:51:49.595]  And they're like, God, sounds like everybody, my family, people that work here go, we're getting set up, aren't we?
[00:51:49.615 --> 00:51:50.255]  And I'm like, yeah.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.821]  So here's the deal.
[00:51:59.881 --> 00:52:00.941]  It's bigger than Infowars.
[00:52:01.982 --> 00:52:04.403]  We were set up as the beta test, the straw man.
[00:52:05.504 --> 00:52:06.305]  Then they expand.
[00:52:07.441 --> 00:52:07.801]  To Trump.
[00:52:08.462 --> 00:52:10.503]  And they say, Trump is gonna cause violence.
[00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:11.663]  Type in the headlines.
[00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:13.504]  Trump's gonna have blood on his hands.
[00:52:13.784 --> 00:52:15.525]  Trump's creating a mob of violent people.
[00:52:15.785 --> 00:52:16.566]  Trump's creating all this.
[00:52:16.606 --> 00:52:16.966]  And then...
[00:52:20.123 --> 00:52:31.171]  They de-platform me off of Facebook, off of Google, off of YouTube, off of Spotify, off of Stitcher, and off of 19 other platforms.
[00:52:31.572 --> 00:52:32.673]  They go after our servers.
[00:52:32.713 --> 00:52:34.254]  They hack attack us and bring us down.
[00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:36.936]  They do fake raids that don't exist.
[00:52:36.956 --> 00:52:40.198]  They go, oh, a station turned off some pirate in December of last year.
[00:52:40.278 --> 00:52:45.482]  We sent people a letter that turns into a raid on my station, some half-watt thing that I never even heard.
[00:52:45.903 --> 00:52:46.583]  We're just guessing.
[00:52:46.623 --> 00:52:47.284]  I never even heard it.
[00:52:50.137 --> 00:52:53.464]  That's the level that this has reached, folks.
[00:52:53.524 --> 00:52:54.346]  Jones is illegal.
[00:52:54.386 --> 00:52:55.007]  He's been raided.
[00:52:55.248 --> 00:52:55.929]  He's off the air.
[00:52:55.969 --> 00:52:57.392]  He's calling for killing the feds.
[00:52:57.673 --> 00:53:00.939]  He's calling for battle rifling the media.
[00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:10.842]  When Antifa's in the news saying we're going to come to your house last Sunday at the White House, they said we're going to come kill the President and we're going to come kill members of Congress.
[00:53:10.862 --> 00:53:14.143]  And I said you folks better have security or you better have your battle rifle ready.
[00:53:14.163 --> 00:53:17.925]  Because Antifa is ready to do it and they mean business.
[00:53:18.505 --> 00:53:19.265]  And I can play it again.
[00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:25.247]  The video that Twitter banned saying I was calling for battle rifles in the media was the video of them saying it.
[00:53:26.808 --> 00:53:28.589]  So this is a major psyop.
[00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:51.387]  And we have Senator Warner and Senator Murphy's, my lawyers, were so freaked out that off my dime, not even paying for it, they went and wrote a detailed analysis, document cam shot please, about how this is totally illegal, an organized plan to take everyone down, and how they have never seen it, and they're actually scared.
[00:53:51.827 --> 00:53:55.328]  By the way, a lot of these lawyers thought I was over the top just six months ago, now they are.
[00:53:56.687 --> 00:53:57.587]  Completely freaked out.
[00:53:58.367 --> 00:54:00.508]  And he's got all the senators and all their admissions.
[00:54:00.808 --> 00:54:04.569]  They're gonna ban all conservatives, all Christians, all veterans groups, all gun groups.
[00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:05.929]  The NRA will be totally banned.
[00:54:06.129 --> 00:54:07.989]  They will have de-platformed, no credit cards.
[00:54:08.229 --> 00:54:10.070]  You'll not be able to even be a NRA member.
[00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.410]  This is a violent counter-revolution against Trump coming in.
[00:54:15.651 --> 00:54:19.291]  And this is... I've got to file injunctions, everything, but the lawyers agree.
[00:54:19.792 --> 00:54:21.912]  They said this would not be going on
[00:54:23.812 --> 00:54:26.433]  If they weren't already planning to have the government take it over.
[00:54:27.033 --> 00:54:28.714]  Because what they're doing is criminally illegal.
[00:54:33.415 --> 00:54:38.257]  They are saying, Senator Murphy, all of them are saying, ban all conservatives.
[00:54:38.497 --> 00:54:39.477]  They're on record.
[00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:40.578]  So, I'm going to tell you again.
[00:54:42.258 --> 00:54:47.280]  They're rolling out paid for PR, because most news articles nowadays are actually paid for on mainstream sites.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:47.960]  It's propaganda.
[00:54:49.008 --> 00:54:52.151]  They're coming out with this Office of Counter-Propaganda.
[00:54:52.211 --> 00:54:57.317]  Obama set up with the CIA before he left and Congress to quote, counter Alex Jones.
[00:54:57.757 --> 00:54:58.939]  They said that last year, remember?
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.081]  In January before he left office.
[00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:04.304]  And now they're doing it with coordination.
[00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:06.267]  They've got three New York Times writers.
[00:55:07.677 --> 00:55:16.783]  Two Washington Post writers and BuzzFeed people here full-time, and we're even getting recordings of these now, where they're calling up Mike Adams and other people.
[00:55:17.223 --> 00:55:24.468]  Six people called me the last week and said, listen, first they call up and say, give us the dirt on Alex Jones, we'll write a huge puff piece on you, how great you are.
[00:55:24.748 --> 00:55:28.951]  When they say there is no dirt, they say, we're going to destroy you over the phone!
[00:55:30.265 --> 00:55:36.307]  The New York Times only does that, like, about uranium or yellow cake or aluminum tubes or WMDs.
[00:55:36.347 --> 00:55:39.707]  They only lie when the strategic elites tell them to, at that level.
[00:55:40.448 --> 00:55:45.389]  The New York Times has so-called Pulitzer Prize winners having their minions call.
[00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:54.671]  They actually use college students, so they have plausible liability, to call up... Yeah, we tell you guys out of there, we know.
[00:55:54.971 --> 00:55:55.812]  You think I'm stupid.
[00:55:56.292 --> 00:55:56.932]  So, anyways.
[00:55:58.803 --> 00:55:59.484]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:55:59.524 --> 00:56:00.865]  All the stuff we've got is not going to matter.
[00:56:00.945 --> 00:56:01.865]  They're about to hit everybody.
[00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:07.430]  They literally call up and go, we will destroy you in the New York Times if you don't tell us that Alex Jones is bad and did illegal things.
[00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:12.274]  I mean, the criminal focus is invasion level.
[00:56:14.536 --> 00:56:20.060]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking down America and Trump and the recovery and the entire free press.
[00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:26.926]  So I'm telling you, like night follows day, the staged terror attacks are coming.
[00:56:28.087 --> 00:56:43.016]  On big tech, government buildings, mainstream media, all the stars will be gone that day, all the stelters will be gone that day, all the Lester Holtz will be gone, and they are going to drive a truck bomb or something into a daycare.
[00:56:44.252 --> 00:56:44.472]  It's
[00:57:03.166 --> 00:57:03.786]  We're good to go.
[00:57:29.153 --> 00:57:32.794]  Before we get there, they're gonna do this, but here's the key when we come back.
[00:57:33.795 --> 00:57:46.780]  If we expose it, and if you get these videos out we're gonna post of this live feed, and you spread them no matter what, and you go wild with the truth, and we're all peaceful and call for peace, and expose the fact that the left is the one being violent, they will not have the cojones to launch it.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.641]  But they silenced me ahead of time because I smelled it!
[00:57:51.942 --> 00:57:56.604]  And all these other company heads, and all these other people know this, and they won't say it.
[00:57:56.704 --> 00:57:57.384]  So I'm here,
[00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.470]  Stop the hammering.
[00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:03.391]  Stop the hammering out there.
[00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:04.271]  Who's got a hammer?
[00:58:04.552 --> 00:58:05.052]  Where is it?
[00:58:05.392 --> 00:58:05.712]  Hammering.
[00:58:06.052 --> 00:58:06.452]  Hammering.
[00:58:06.712 --> 00:58:07.113]  Hammering.
[00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:07.793]  Hammering.
[00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:09.073]  Where's the hammer?
[00:58:09.874 --> 00:58:11.714]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[00:58:11.834 --> 00:58:13.955]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[00:58:14.135 --> 00:58:14.435]  Hammering.
[00:58:14.795 --> 00:58:15.195]  Hammering.
[00:58:15.476 --> 00:58:15.876]  Hammering.
[00:58:16.116 --> 00:58:16.536]  Hammering.
[00:58:16.796 --> 00:58:17.236]  Hammering.
[00:58:17.556 --> 00:58:19.177]  Stop the hammering!
[00:58:22.304 --> 00:58:23.625]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[00:58:23.645 --> 00:58:25.267]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[00:58:25.407 --> 00:58:26.888]  Stop the hammering!
[00:58:27.188 --> 00:58:27.609]  Hammering.
[00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:28.189]  Hammering.
[00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:33.253]  And all these fools and all these traitors don't get it.
[00:58:33.814 --> 00:58:40.219]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.842]  It just f***ing sucks.
[00:58:43.182 --> 00:58:47.445]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out-of-control s***.
[00:58:48.126 --> 00:58:54.051]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control everything.
[00:58:54.091 --> 00:58:54.451]  They're here.
[00:58:54.951 --> 00:58:57.854]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[00:58:57.914 --> 00:58:58.634]  That's what I know.
[00:58:59.315 --> 00:59:02.397]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[00:59:02.777 --> 00:59:06.921]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure.
[00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:14.006]  At Infowarshore.com, standing with America, standing against the chi-coms in Hollywood, standing for victory and winning, thanks to you.
[00:59:14.086 --> 00:59:14.566]  We'll be back.
[00:59:15.407 --> 00:59:18.489]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:20.311]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[00:59:20.811 --> 00:59:24.513]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:59:24.674 --> 00:59:29.717]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:59:29.897 --> 00:59:31.078]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:31.218 --> 00:59:32.779]  It is absolutely free.
[00:59:33.039 --> 00:59:37.903]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:59:38.243 --> 00:59:41.864]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:59:41.984 --> 00:59:46.106]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:59:46.326 --> 00:59:50.667]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:59:53.468 --> 00:59:59.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.262 --> 01:00:15.344]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.345 --> 01:00:20.645]  There must be some way out of here.
[01:00:20.665 --> 01:00:23.886]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[01:00:25.807 --> 01:00:27.948]  There's too much confusion.
[01:00:29.588 --> 01:00:31.329]  I can't get no relief.
[01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.390]  Businessmanly.
[01:00:35.816 --> 01:00:40.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I've ever done in my life.
[01:00:44.662 --> 01:00:58.292]  The mainstream corporate media is in every major paper in the country, every so-called news channel, saying that President Trump wants violence against the media, that I want violence, that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks on the media, and they don't even show where I said it.
[01:00:59.192 --> 01:00:59.893]  This is grave.
[01:01:00.996 --> 01:01:07.378]  It means we could be hours, days, weeks away going into this election in what, 82 days from now?
[01:01:09.538 --> 01:01:24.902]  To stage a huge event just like evidence shows Bill Clinton and the deep state did in 95 when they were way behind the polls to blame the Midwest and the American people for Oklahoma City to then get a sympathy vote for the Democrats and Bill Clinton.
[01:01:26.274 --> 01:01:31.237]  They are saying that imminent attacks are going to happen and the blood will be on President Trump's hands.
[01:01:32.058 --> 01:01:34.860]  They are now saying imminent attacks are coming and that it's going to be my fault.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.041]  How obvious.
[01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:44.186]  The very same deep state where the Clinton's in control of it has done this before and was able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in 1995.
[01:01:44.986 --> 01:01:55.974]  Bill Clinton told USA Today on Air Force One, pull it up, he said, I was able to win re-election and come from behind because of Oklahoma City.
[01:01:57.717 --> 01:02:00.299]  Now they're saying that I'm promoting a new Oklahoma City.
[01:02:00.359 --> 01:02:05.444]  Let me show you some of these incredible articles if you're a TV viewer.
[01:02:05.784 --> 01:02:07.185]  Look at this.
[01:02:07.385 --> 01:02:08.726]  CNN yesterday.
[01:02:11.048 --> 01:02:13.550]  Alex Jones complicit in domestic terror.
[01:02:14.051 --> 01:02:16.313]  Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist.
[01:02:16.773 --> 01:02:18.915]  No proof, no links, no nothing.
[01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:24.560]  Articles saying that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks.
[01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:27.040]  Nowhere is there a video.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:31.121]  All they show is quotes around single or two words connected together.
[01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:36.464]  When Antifa said they were coming to attack members of Congress and their families, I said, you better get your battle rifles ready.
[01:02:36.704 --> 01:02:41.326]  They then show a quote and say, Antifa, mainstream media, chi-com operatives.
[01:02:42.766 --> 01:02:44.387]  And Twitter took me offline for that fraud.
[01:02:45.455 --> 01:02:51.398]  DrudgeReport.com, link to our article, video, Lester Holt's a liar, Alex Jones did not call for violence.
[01:02:51.799 --> 01:02:57.722]  MSM, talking heads, falsely claiming infowars and citing violence against the media ahead of the big event.
[01:02:57.762 --> 01:03:03.986]  They say there's going to be an attack, mark my words, on CNN, that's Ryan Stelter.
[01:03:04.686 --> 01:03:07.267]  They're saying there's going to be a mass shooting, there's going to be an Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:03:07.428 --> 01:03:09.549]  They're everywhere, and they've done it before!
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.120]  So, I'm not a rocket scientist to figure this out.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:14.921]  They've done it before.
[01:03:15.741 --> 01:03:16.741]  They've gotten away with it.
[01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:22.602]  Meanwhile, FCC shuts down Alex Jones' pirate flagship radio station, AP.
[01:03:23.402 --> 01:03:26.123]  I woke up this morning and I said, is there even a pirate radio station in Austin?
[01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:27.803]  There used to be some years ago.
[01:03:27.943 --> 01:03:32.284]  Punk, rock, conservative, Christian, sometimes shows that have my stuff on it.
[01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:35.425]  I don't even really listen to a lot of terrestrial radio because I'm working all the time.
[01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:43.097]  I go read the article and it goes, well actually last year some locals had some low power you can only hear for a mile and they turned it off last year.
[01:03:44.158 --> 01:03:48.059]  But then the article at the bottom says it was turned off this year or last year.
[01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:50.841]  I have nothing to do with it, but I'm running it didn't even know it existed.
[01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:57.443]  It's all about saying I'm illegal, I'm being shut down to scare our commercial AM and FM stations that they're going to get FCC rated.
[01:03:58.904 --> 01:03:59.584]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:01.938]  It is happening.
[01:04:02.058 --> 01:04:02.699]  It is on.
[01:04:02.779 --> 01:04:04.079]  The deep state is moving.
[01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:05.239]  They believe you're stupid.
[01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:07.060]  I believe you're not stupid.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.501]  But here's the last pieces of evidence.
[01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:11.801]  That document cam shot, please.
[01:04:12.101 --> 01:04:15.142]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:15.762]  Reason.
[01:04:16.843 --> 01:04:17.343]  Axios.
[01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:21.864]  Senator Warner has a plan to censor the entire Internet and take it over.
[01:04:22.164 --> 01:04:23.785]  Zero Hedge article really breaks it down better.
[01:04:23.805 --> 01:04:24.525]  Please print me that one.
[01:04:25.025 --> 01:04:28.246]  Here's the actual plan to take over the Internet by Senator Warner.
[01:04:29.086 --> 01:04:30.687]  Here's Senator Murphy.
[01:04:32.136 --> 01:04:35.097]  Saying that they're going to take over the internet, not stop with Alex Jones.
[01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:53.606]  They're going to stage a false flag, ladies and gentlemen, and then against themselves, make themselves victims, and then blame all libertarians, all conservatives, Trump, and then use our shutdown on social media, they've already beta tested on me, as a smoke screen for stealing the election on November 8th.
[01:04:53.686 --> 01:04:55.767]  It's happening, it's a fact, emergency!
[01:04:55.827 --> 01:05:00.869]  Get this out to everyone, re-upload this video, tweet it out everywhere, and get it to the White House and President Trump!

[01:06:14.616 --> 01:06:16.737]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:17.257 --> 01:06:18.617]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:31.696]  26, 27 years ago when Bill Clinton was in office.
[01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:38.279]  And they had burned down Waco and murdered the people.
[01:06:38.499 --> 01:06:41.781]  And I didn't know what was going on when I was right out of high school when that happened.
[01:06:43.281 --> 01:06:51.085]  But I was working two jobs and I was going to community college, figuring out if I wanted to go to college or what I wanted to do.
[01:06:52.756 --> 01:06:58.961]  Because I was doing these jobs, I was making more money than most people I knew that had college degrees.
[01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.382]  Most of them were bagging groceries.
[01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:04.926]  And so I was thinking, do I want to go to college?
[01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:11.071]  And I would watch C-SPAN, and I watched these hearings in 94 and 95 about Waco.
[01:07:11.852 --> 01:07:17.617]  And how the Delta Force was sent in to kill everybody under orders, and how General Schumacher was depressed about it.
[01:07:17.717 --> 01:07:20.740]  And it all came out in Congress, and the flare footage and everything.
[01:07:22.156 --> 01:07:34.039]  I was like, man, the sheriff testified, why didn't they just pick up Vernon Howell, aka the cult leader, because he was a weirdo, in town?
[01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:39.920]  Why didn't they just pick up David Koresh in town where he had a business, an auto parts repair shop?
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.861]  Because they wanted the big raid, they drove up, they shot up the building, they wanted to go after the right-wing American cults, it was all planned.
[01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:49.951]  But it blew up in their face.
[01:07:50.051 --> 01:08:01.976]  So then, they activated a special operations soldier, Tim McVeigh, who'd been assigned and sheep-dipped to a group even more secret than Delta Force, attached to the CIA.
[01:08:01.996 --> 01:08:08.239]  I know folks that served with McVeigh in the special group.
[01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:09.819]  That's why they're so scared of me.
[01:08:13.821 --> 01:08:18.403]  And McVeigh went all over the country tracking militia groups, right-wing groups, all this stuff for the Clintons.
[01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:25.304]  But when he wouldn't agree to bomb the daycare center and he said, no, pick another target.
[01:08:27.564 --> 01:08:29.385]  They drugged him up, put him on the side of the road.
[01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:31.805]  State police found him drooling, crawling around the ground.
[01:08:32.065 --> 01:08:37.746]  That's in the original Oklahoma City newspaper.
[01:08:38.266 --> 01:08:39.806]  State police said, yeah, we found him drooling.
[01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:42.127]  Saying, I got a chip.
[01:08:42.347 --> 01:08:42.907]  I got a chip.
[01:08:42.947 --> 01:08:43.687]  They blew my chip.
[01:08:43.767 --> 01:08:44.087]  It hurts.
[01:08:47.868 --> 01:08:48.188]  Look it up.
[01:08:48.708 --> 01:08:49.368]  They blew my chip.
[01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:57.653]  So imagine I start getting into this and reading this stuff, and then Oklahoma City happens right at the time I'm going on AXS TV.
[01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:04.797]  And I see Benton Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, showing the bombs in the building, and they're having press conferences with people that were in the building that saw.
[01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:13.742]  She's like, yeah, I saw the head of the FBI here the day after the bombing, but I saw him the week before putting wires in the walls.
[01:09:14.943 --> 01:09:16.404]  And I sure thought he was handsome.
[01:09:19.813 --> 01:09:30.840]  Then I interviewed the widows of the people, the police officers that were tortured to death and killed because they were the first responders, and what they saw.
[01:09:34.682 --> 01:09:35.543]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:09:38.464 --> 01:09:47.510]  Don Browning, highly decorated Marine in Vietnam, head of the K-9 unit, was the second respondent for Terrence Yakey, black police officer, man of the year that hauled out dozens of people on his back.
[01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:50.276]  He was a successful linebacker in college.
[01:09:50.296 --> 01:09:54.037]  I interviewed his wife, all of them.
[01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:58.098]  The last call to his partner was, I got the FBI pulling me over.
[01:09:58.178 --> 01:09:59.699]  They tortured him to death right there in that field.
[01:10:00.319 --> 01:10:01.780]  Don Browning named the guys.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.121]  They deleted it off YouTube, but he was on a few years ago.
[01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:07.962]  Don Browning was on this show.
[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:16.234]  And he said, yeah, the FBI threatened me at the water cooler and in my office twice to kill me and my wife if I talked about what I saw that day.
[01:10:17.054 --> 01:10:24.439]  And I said, name their names, and he went... He went, okay, but you can tell he's a strong guy.
[01:10:24.459 --> 01:10:26.980]  Vietnam hero, silver stars, you name it.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.882]  He's putting his wife and him on the line here, and he named them.
[01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:37.307]  So did I. So see, I crossed this bridge a long time ago being scared of you guys.
[01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:39.168]  I'm scared of failing against you.
[01:10:40.342 --> 01:10:42.723]  And I don't think the whole FBI is bad.
[01:10:43.303 --> 01:10:46.124]  When I've had stuff done to us or stuff goes on, I go report to the FBI.
[01:10:46.564 --> 01:10:48.004]  And that's the paradox of good and evil.
[01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:51.265]  The FBI is either like the best people in the world or the worst people in the world.
[01:10:51.285 --> 01:10:53.286]  And I've confronted Janet Reno and all of them about this.
[01:10:55.206 --> 01:11:00.308]  So I learned about all this when I was knee high to a grasshopper.
[01:11:00.688 --> 01:11:04.289]  And then everything I was told that I didn't even know was true or not came true.
[01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:08.210]  And I learned it was all true from family that saw it for themselves firsthand.
[01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:12.876]  And I decided to be on the side of good.
[01:11:15.298 --> 01:11:20.802]  And so if you want to know what's about to happen right now, you need to know about Oklahoma City.
[01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:30.549]  And you need to know how the Southern Poverty Law Center and the feds pulled that off, and how federal informants thought they were just going to sting the bomb.
[01:11:31.009 --> 01:11:33.451]  They tried to, Carol Howe and others tried to stop it, so they indicted her.
[01:11:34.966 --> 01:11:36.206]  And McVeigh was gonna go public.
[01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:37.786]  He said, I'm not gonna blow up a daycare.
[01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:39.967]  Blow it up at night when they're not there.
[01:11:39.987 --> 01:11:41.367]  I talked to folks that knew him.
[01:11:42.827 --> 01:11:44.868]  McVeigh was like, blow it up at night, dammit.
[01:11:45.508 --> 01:11:47.168]  Kill a couple guards in there.
[01:11:47.288 --> 01:11:48.808]  I'm not blowing up school children.
[01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:51.029]  Not blowing up a frickin' nursery.
[01:11:55.249 --> 01:11:56.770]  And Larry Nichols came out and said that.
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.730]  I've interviewed death row inmates that were on with him.
[01:12:02.871 --> 01:12:04.331]  And so the very same people
[01:12:06.277 --> 01:12:09.419]  I mean, Eric Holder was the Deputy Attorney General at the time, running the operation.
[01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:10.920]  Came out in emails, in lawsuits.
[01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:15.242]  They're the ones getting ready for a new Oklahoma City.
[01:12:15.262 --> 01:12:20.685]  I don't know if it's going to be Google, Twitter, Apple, Spotify, Stitcher.
[01:12:20.705 --> 01:12:23.627]  They'll probably get some federal building, CNN.
[01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:26.809]  I don't know, but let me tell you something.
[01:12:26.829 --> 01:12:30.271]  You ever come to work, and your bosses were supposed to be there?
[01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:33.753]  And you never show up to work, and you look around,
[01:12:35.717 --> 01:12:37.358]  And nobody's there in management.
[01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:39.498]  You better get your butt out of that building.
[01:12:40.638 --> 01:12:41.039]  Like that.
[01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:45.740]  Cause the feds were out of the building on Oklahoma City too.
[01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:49.441]  And I've interviewed Jane Graham at HUD.
[01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:50.261]  I've interviewed them all.
[01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:55.603]  And they just showed up and like, it was mainly a federal building and nobody was there.
[01:12:57.544 --> 01:12:58.804]  So, cause that's how this works.
[01:13:00.029 --> 01:13:06.874]  You know, one of the CIA guys is having sex with one of the girls there, and he's like, sweetheart, I don't think you need to show up to work next week.
[01:13:08.876 --> 01:13:12.319]  Kind of like they called it a conspiracy theory, but it was even the New York Post, it was in the New York Daily News.
[01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:17.243]  A week before 9-11, Muslim kids would point at the towers and they'd say, those won't be there next week.
[01:13:18.244 --> 01:13:19.605]  Yeah, there's CBS News.
[01:13:20.025 --> 01:13:22.067]  What Feds Do Before OKC Bombing.
[01:13:24.368 --> 01:13:27.291]  So people have a way of not being able to keep stuff secret.
[01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:30.282]  So, let me tell you something.
[01:13:30.722 --> 01:13:31.583]  I'm not that important.
[01:13:32.444 --> 01:13:38.187]  They didn't spend hundreds of millions of dollars demonizing me the last two years for no reason.
[01:13:38.207 --> 01:13:48.194]  They're going to use me as the catalyst to get everybody to accept me being deplatformed and, you know, get the idea of Feds raid Jones, shut down illegal station.
[01:13:48.494 --> 01:13:49.194]  No such thing.
[01:13:49.214 --> 01:13:49.935]  It's all made up.
[01:13:51.356 --> 01:13:53.957]  Some half watt thing a year ago or something.
[01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:54.678]  I never even heard.
[01:13:57.813 --> 01:13:59.974]  They're beta testing to make their big move.
[01:14:02.714 --> 01:14:04.175]  And this is it.
[01:14:06.115 --> 01:14:06.616]  This is it.
[01:14:06.836 --> 01:14:09.476]  Now, the good news is I've been called by national talk show hosts.
[01:14:09.897 --> 01:14:12.837]  We have the phones ringing off the hook and affiliate relations from TV and radio.
[01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.498]  Because they know how things work.
[01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:22.860]  They know we're on commercial satellites, fire the tones, follow FCC, even blur out people flipping folks off on videos we show.
[01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:24.481]  Even CNN doesn't do that.
[01:14:26.101 --> 01:14:28.964]  And the station managers are going, yeah, you're not running pirate stations.
[01:14:29.004 --> 01:14:30.065]  You're all FCC compliant.
[01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:30.966]  This is a hoax.
[01:14:31.046 --> 01:14:31.726]  They all get it.
[01:14:33.488 --> 01:14:39.454]  And they get how they staged, the Globalists staged this in 1995 to blame talk radio and free speech.
[01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:47.141]  Now, they weren't able to shut talk radio down like they tried with bills, but they were able to get Bill Clinton reelected to continue on, and he credited it.
[01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:48.862]  So what are you going to do?
[01:14:48.882 --> 01:14:52.547]  You're the ruthless Democrats that say America was never great and all the rest of this.
[01:14:52.807 --> 01:14:56.772]  When you're way behind, you're losing the early bellwether special elections.
[01:14:57.133 --> 01:14:58.494]  No matter what you've done, you're behind.
[01:14:58.574 --> 01:15:00.136]  All the world populace are popping up.
[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:18.823]  You're going to bring in censorship, you're going to bring in control, you're going to bring in bullying, and you're going to silence Alex Jones and kick him off Google and YouTube and Facebook and freeze us on Twitter and knock us off Spotify and everywhere else ahead of the big event.
[01:15:19.143 --> 01:15:24.047]  But the people woke up, made us number one in the podcast, number one in the apps anyways.
[01:15:24.427 --> 01:15:25.788]  So now they're going, what do we do?
[01:15:25.828 --> 01:15:26.989]  This is getting too obvious.
[01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:31.970]  You take the video of this live show I've done that we're going to post on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.330]  We're going to put a splash page up right in the front.
[01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:38.051]  I had this idea when they took us down with a hack attack a few days ago.
[01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:39.412]  We could just direct to a splash page.
[01:15:40.012 --> 01:15:41.172]  And then traffic went up even more.
[01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:43.112]  So we'll just do that with a splash page.
[01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:44.593]  By the way, we're under DDoS attack right now.
[01:15:44.613 --> 01:15:45.393]  I was told an hour ago.
[01:15:46.053 --> 01:15:48.414]  And we're going to link to all these videos they don't want.
[01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:49.794]  So you can email the link.
[01:15:50.948 --> 01:15:55.411]  And so you can call everybody, and so you can re-upload it, and we may be able to stop the false flag.
[01:15:55.791 --> 01:15:59.214]  We can stop their operation to overthrow the country when we come back.
[01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:01.395]  This is history.
[01:16:02.155 --> 01:16:10.141]  There was some bad news recently for extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist and bath salt spokesmodel Alex Jones.
[01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:15.564]  Because it looks like his website InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[01:16:17.165 --> 01:16:17.946]  Yesterday,
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.601]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:23.522]  I think the things he says are awful.
[01:16:23.562 --> 01:16:24.703]  He makes me physically sick.
[01:16:24.743 --> 01:16:33.268]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[01:16:33.308 --> 01:16:36.390]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:40.312]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:43.013]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[01:16:43.053 --> 01:16:47.054]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:16:47.154 --> 01:16:49.475]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:16:49.595 --> 01:16:58.798]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[01:16:59.139 --> 01:16:59.999]  So, if
[01:17:03.404 --> 01:17:03.944]  We're out of there.
[01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:19.376]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers alleging that these were merely, that these were actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[01:17:19.396 --> 01:17:21.078]  David Hogg, a day after the event,
[01:17:21.698 --> 01:17:22.098]  We're good to go.
[01:17:39.713 --> 01:17:44.917]  They misrepresented and said that I bullied him and said that nobody died, even though he's a public figure.
[01:17:45.197 --> 01:17:46.258]  I would have a right to say that.
[01:17:46.378 --> 01:17:47.559]  I didn't say that.
[01:17:47.679 --> 01:17:56.326]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[01:17:56.366 --> 01:18:08.056]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack happened and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy.
[01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:10.317]  I did not post a video doing that.
[01:18:10.697 --> 01:18:11.798]  It was all over the news.
[01:18:12.098 --> 01:18:13.438]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[01:18:14.199 --> 01:18:18.521]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I'd said that I didn't say it.
[01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:28.946]  And you got your asses kicked because I had InfoWars.com and I had NewsWars.com and I was able to counter and show what I said.
[01:18:29.006 --> 01:18:31.147]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:18:31.977 --> 01:18:39.319]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[01:18:39.499 --> 01:18:47.441]  Our reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:50.342]  I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[01:18:50.782 --> 01:18:52.283]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[01:18:53.163 --> 01:18:54.703]  Like, you know, good friends, family.
[01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:56.544]  Well, like you said, CNN's not calling anymore.
[01:18:56.984 --> 01:19:03.025]  And I say, well, you know, tell me, if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[01:19:03.085 --> 01:19:09.107]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:11.588]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[01:19:11.968 --> 01:19:15.629]  And when I go find it, I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:18.069]  Well, then, you know, then there's like this back pedal.
[01:19:18.089 --> 01:19:21.390]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:24.811]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions.
[01:19:25.331 --> 01:19:31.874]  All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[01:19:31.954 --> 01:19:37.156]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:38.056]  Alex Jones.
[01:19:38.216 --> 01:19:39.016]  Alex Jones.
[01:19:39.216 --> 01:19:40.297]  Infowars.com.
[01:19:40.377 --> 01:19:41.017]  Infowars.
[01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:41.377]  Alex Jones.
[01:19:41.457 --> 01:19:42.798]  From Infowars.
[01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:43.518]  Infowars.
[01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:49.722]  I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:19:50.223 --> 01:19:54.105]  But he's got a point of view and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[01:19:54.126 --> 01:19:59.629]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him, prevent him from speaking.
[01:20:05.073 --> 01:20:07.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.262 --> 01:20:23.902]  Big Brother.
[01:20:24.402 --> 01:20:25.643]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:26.203 --> 01:20:27.303]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:28.043 --> 01:20:29.544]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:30.924]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:31.444 --> 01:20:36.186]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:45.205 --> 01:20:47.786]  Alright, this is not hype, this is not hyperbole.
[01:20:49.146 --> 01:20:56.889]  Every mainstream, corporate, false news, fake news outlet is lying, saying Trump is calling for violence against them, that I'm calling for violence.
[01:20:57.329 --> 01:20:59.510]  They never show the proof, they just keep saying it.
[01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:07.693]  Clearly, like 1995, they're preparing to stage a terror attack against themselves to make themselves the victims.
[01:21:08.413 --> 01:21:09.954]  How do we counter this?
[01:21:10.054 --> 01:21:10.694]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:21:11.314 --> 01:21:12.655]  OnlyDrudgeReport.com
[01:21:14.224 --> 01:21:15.245]  Top-linked yesterday.
[01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.947]  It's mid-linked today because of the death of a famous musician.
[01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:29.294]  Linked to our article on DrudgeReport.com, where Alex Jones' blatant lies being told about us.
[01:21:30.955 --> 01:21:33.216]  Twitter defends healthy behavior of users.
[01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:34.457]  They demand it.
[01:21:36.098 --> 01:21:39.600]  Trust and Safety Council working overtime to ban conservatives.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.441]  That's what they've set up.
[01:21:41.448 --> 01:21:47.934]  So I shoot videos yesterday on our other sub-accounts saying I'm not calling for violence, I never said it, they delete those.
[01:21:48.094 --> 01:22:02.227]  Because the key here to the left is robbing your identity, saying they speak for you, saying you said things you didn't say, and then silencing you so they can lie about you.
[01:22:02.727 --> 01:22:03.588]  That's what's happening.
[01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:09.312]  From the left-hand side of JudgeReport.com, Alex Jones' blatant lies being told about me.
[01:22:09.652 --> 01:22:22.607]  Now, in the next few hours, we will post to InfoWars.com the fifth segment and the first segment of the last hour.
[01:22:23.988 --> 01:22:26.031]  My emergency warning of imminent false flag.
[01:22:27.722 --> 01:22:29.984]  To throw the election for the Democrats and ban free speech.
[01:22:30.485 --> 01:22:33.728]  And that's going to go up on InfoWars.com, on our own servers.
[01:22:34.429 --> 01:22:43.479]  Anyone that wants to take it, from Real.Video, to your own site on Facebook, to your own site on Twitter, you have a right and a duty to get that up.
[01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.841]  And if you want to do commentary on it, that's even better.
[01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:48.063]  And yeah, they may try to block you, they may try to whatever.
[01:22:48.124 --> 01:22:49.085]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:50.146]  This is a total war.
[01:22:51.598 --> 01:22:58.704]  They are beta testing, staging attacks against themselves, preconditioning people, it's our fault, to throw the election and then shut our free speech down.
[01:22:59.064 --> 01:23:02.227]  Senator Warner and Murphy say they're going to ban everyone.
[01:23:02.668 --> 01:23:03.829]  This is their assault.
[01:23:03.869 --> 01:23:14.798]  They're going to act like total authoritarians because we had an election, we beat Hillary, the country's coming back, they're panicking, they think America was never great, they hate America because they're globalist.
[01:23:14.818 --> 01:23:15.759]  We'll play Cuomo in a minute.
[01:23:18.362 --> 01:23:19.603]  So, this is not rhetoric.
[01:23:19.683 --> 01:23:20.804]  This is the main assault.
[01:23:20.964 --> 01:23:21.465]  This is it.
[01:23:21.985 --> 01:23:23.046]  Infowars.com.
[01:23:23.406 --> 01:23:24.247]  Newswars.com.
[01:23:24.747 --> 01:23:29.291]  Why are they running a hoax story that the Feds raided a flagship station?
[01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:31.152]  That means that's what I broadcast out of.
[01:23:31.192 --> 01:23:33.695]  You know, like a flagship means where the Admiral is.
[01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:35.076]  Where he commands from.
[01:23:36.297 --> 01:23:37.898]  I've never heard of this radio station.
[01:23:38.218 --> 01:23:39.559]  Never heard of the names they mention.
[01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:43.022]  They say it was off like last year and that no one could hear it.
[01:23:43.402 --> 01:23:45.064]  There's been some stations I could hear in Austin.
[01:23:46.826 --> 01:23:48.026]  It's just total insanity.
[01:23:48.046 --> 01:23:51.687]  It's the idea that the FCC is now moving against Alex Jones.
[01:23:52.047 --> 01:23:57.028]  That gives it governmental cover.
[01:23:58.289 --> 01:24:00.849]  That gives it the idea that I'm being shut down by the government.
[01:24:00.989 --> 01:24:01.930]  It's insane.
[01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:03.650]  And Ajay Pai came out.
[01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:04.690]  He wasn't anti-Alex Jones.
[01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:07.491]  He said, listen, we shut down pirate stations regardless of what's on it.
[01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:09.031]  Who knows what was even on it?
[01:24:11.052 --> 01:24:12.152]  So again, this is the illusion.
[01:24:14.687 --> 01:24:17.448]  Drudge, Alex Jones takes a lick and keeps on ticking.
[01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:21.929]  Media pioneer remarks on Big Tech's actions against Infowars.
[01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:30.312]  Media pioneer Matt Drudge weighed in on the tech industry's unprecedented moves against Infowars by remarking Thursday on Alex Jones' resilience.
[01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:31.553]  Matt, it's your resilience.
[01:24:31.573 --> 01:24:32.413]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:24:32.453 --> 01:24:33.173]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:24:33.213 --> 01:24:33.773]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:24:34.113 --> 01:24:34.934]  Thank you so much, man.
[01:24:34.954 --> 01:24:35.374]  I love you.
[01:24:38.095 --> 01:24:39.517]  Courage, because I know people don't have it.
[01:24:40.097 --> 01:24:42.260]  And we would have no voice outside InfoWars if it wasn't for you.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.341]  It means so much.
[01:24:43.361 --> 01:24:48.386]  I got so upset knowing that Holt thinks he can lie about me and say that I want to kill journalists and not show it.
[01:24:48.446 --> 01:24:49.047]  What a fraud.
[01:24:49.808 --> 01:24:52.731]  And then no one would even know except for InfoWars and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:53.371]  So thank you, Matt.
[01:24:55.434 --> 01:24:56.134]  I'm serious.
[01:24:57.736 --> 01:24:58.437]  It's just insane.
[01:24:59.827 --> 01:25:01.508]  He says, takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
[01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:02.588]  I guess a Timex deal.
[01:25:02.608 --> 01:25:03.889]  And that's what he put out.
[01:25:03.989 --> 01:25:05.329]  Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
[01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:14.953]  The News Kingpin has provided, over the past several days, wall-to-wall coverage of major tech companies banning InfoWars content for alleged and unspecified policy violations.
[01:25:15.839 --> 01:25:16.640]  That just goes on.
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:34.873]  As of publication, M4 has either been banned or reprimanded by services including Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Google Podcasts, Spotify, TuneIn, Speaker, iHeartRadio, Audioboom, Pinterest, MailChimp, Stitcher, DiscussUs, Sprout, Social, LinkedIn, Flickr, Vimeo, Shopify, and Criteo.
[01:25:36.014 --> 01:25:40.837]  Somebody made a joke about you can take our freedom, but you can't take our Tumblr.
[01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:42.518]  Now they're trying to take that away.
[01:25:42.538 --> 01:25:43.659]  I don't even know what Tumblr is.
[01:25:43.719 --> 01:25:44.700]  It was a joke meme.
[01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:54.694]  Despite attempts by mainstream press and tech companies to stifle content, interest in Infowars website, the Alex Jones Show has skyrocketed, thanks to you by word of mouth.
[01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:56.135]  But here's the problem.
[01:25:57.475 --> 01:26:00.557]  Everybody, my family, you name it, the crew, said they're getting ready to set us up.
[01:26:00.637 --> 01:26:09.741]  Yeah, they don't take some pirate station I don't even know about from last year that went off the air that no one could hear, that I didn't even know existed, and say it's my flagship and the feds are raiding me.
[01:26:10.102 --> 01:26:14.564]  That's to, like, just get the idea, well, he had that illegal station, you know, we had to raid him.
[01:26:16.536 --> 01:26:18.797]  So just download everything I've ever said, keep it, whatever.
[01:26:19.157 --> 01:26:20.417]  This has been a big marathon for me.
[01:26:20.457 --> 01:26:21.337]  Whatever happens, happens.
[01:26:21.397 --> 01:26:22.177]  I'm worried about you.
[01:26:22.638 --> 01:26:23.378]  I'm worried about Trump.
[01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:24.478]  I'm worried about Drudge.
[01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:25.598]  I'm worried about free market.
[01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:26.498]  I'm worried about America.
[01:26:26.518 --> 01:26:30.840]  I'm worried about our kids because, man, these people will lie their butts off, man.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.081]  Again, there's even some recordings of this.
[01:26:35.141 --> 01:26:38.281]  I didn't ask folks to do it, but I warned a few people it was coming.
[01:26:38.321 --> 01:26:39.642]  I've been called by six people.
[01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:40.622]  A lot of them I didn't warn.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.902]  That the New York Times literally has people threatening them saying, you say bad stuff about Jones or else.
[01:26:47.382 --> 01:26:51.944]  Dude, that is so actionable, that's so illegal, but they don't care.
[01:26:54.685 --> 01:27:07.950]  Because there's going to be a staged terror attack against a major media institution or multiple ones, a mass shooting, a bombing, whatever, and they're going to say, see, we told you in these editorials that the Boston Globe ordered that Trump's going to cause violence with no proof, and I am.
[01:27:09.108 --> 01:27:18.812]  And all this edited lies to prime the pump that people, when they do the big massacre and carry out the bloody babies with firemen carrying them, that people believe.
[01:27:18.952 --> 01:27:26.055]  But, if you take this live feed from Infowars.com forward slash show and spread it to everybody you know and say, emergency, emergency.
[01:27:26.535 --> 01:27:31.597]  If you take the video that I did earlier, we're posting right now to our own servers.
[01:27:33.037 --> 01:27:36.719]  And if you get that out, and it chain reactions across the country,
[01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:38.815]  I don't even know how internet works.
[01:27:38.835 --> 01:27:42.516]  We said where people can download to their desktop, people where they can grab it, send forward the link, whatever.
[01:27:44.257 --> 01:27:49.978]  If you'll post what we cover, edit it however you want, just get it out to Infowars.com, post it to YouTube, Facebook, wherever.
[01:27:50.419 --> 01:27:51.639]  Call it Puppy Dogs and Kittens.
[01:27:52.079 --> 01:27:52.839]  Call it Verboten.
[01:27:53.159 --> 01:27:53.940]  Call it whatever you want.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.080]  Just get it out.
[01:27:55.998 --> 01:28:02.521]  Because they've got armies of people battle-testing how to censor right now when they blow up their own news organizations.
[01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:04.182]  The newspapers are already bankrupt.
[01:28:04.222 --> 01:28:05.083]  It's all sinking.
[01:28:05.343 --> 01:28:06.503]  The corporate media is dead.
[01:28:06.723 --> 01:28:07.604]  The Democrats are dead.
[01:28:07.964 --> 01:28:13.987]  All they can do, like a bar that's out of business in Goodfellas and been bankrupted, is burn it down for the insurance money.
[01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:17.309]  The Democrats and the globalists are getting ready to burn down
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.640]  A tech company.
[01:28:20.141 --> 01:28:21.841]  They're getting ready to burn down the stock market.
[01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:22.581]  They've said they will.
[01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:23.842]  They're already trying to crash the economy.
[01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:24.322]  Bill Maher.
[01:28:24.642 --> 01:28:38.326]  They're getting ready to physically shoot up some of their facilities after saying I'm calling for it with no proof as to be the wall of indignation and anger to steal the election in November and then have the cover story for it.
[01:28:39.502 --> 01:28:40.823]  This is maximum red alert.
[01:28:40.863 --> 01:28:42.764]  This is the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[01:28:43.185 --> 01:28:44.165]  Maximum red alert.
[01:28:44.646 --> 01:28:50.570]  I believe from the evidence we pushed ahead their time frame to delist us and deplatform us because we started exposing them.
[01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:52.792]  I believe a false flag's coming from their own statements.
[01:28:53.032 --> 01:28:55.734]  You can see the corporate priming, the rollout, the PR.
[01:28:55.994 --> 01:28:57.115]  It's happening.
[01:28:57.515 --> 01:28:58.716]  All we can do is try to stop it.
[01:28:59.056 --> 01:28:59.897]  Red alert!
[01:29:00.177 --> 01:29:00.657]  Red alert!
[01:29:01.058 --> 01:29:08.303]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:29:08.683 --> 01:29:16.168]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:29:16.609 --> 01:29:19.691]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:29:20.331 --> 01:29:24.793]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:29:24.973 --> 01:29:28.894]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.835]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:29:32.255 --> 01:29:36.397]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:39.998]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:55.304]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:29:55.544 --> 01:29:56.845]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:29:57.085 --> 01:29:59.326]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:04.915 --> 01:30:12.418]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:30:12.918 --> 01:30:26.004]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:30.788]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:30:31.268 --> 01:30:35.393]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:30:35.613 --> 01:30:37.776]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:30:40.387 --> 01:30:46.949]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:53.352]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[01:30:53.692 --> 01:30:55.292]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[01:30:55.713 --> 01:30:56.513]  It's fulfilling.
[01:30:56.713 --> 01:30:57.433]  InfoWars.
[01:30:57.793 --> 01:30:59.454]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:31:00.314 --> 01:31:02.635]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:31:02.655 --> 01:31:04.396]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:31:04.816 --> 01:31:07.617]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:31:08.749 --> 01:31:19.794]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:31:20.234 --> 01:31:29.318]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:31:29.838 --> 01:31:35.405]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:31:35.626 --> 01:31:40.792]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:31:41.073 --> 01:31:43.035]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:31:43.336 --> 01:31:43.876]  Buy these!
[01:31:44.477 --> 01:31:45.358]  Sold out in a month!
[01:31:46.615 --> 01:31:49.417]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:31:49.617 --> 01:31:51.018]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:31:51.658 --> 01:31:54.200]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.921]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:31:57.482 --> 01:31:59.743]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[01:32:04.505 --> 01:32:07.606]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:32:07.646 --> 01:32:08.166]  You're on the air.
[01:32:08.186 --> 01:32:08.707]  Thanks for holding.
[01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:10.207]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:32:10.407 --> 01:32:10.787]  Hey, brother.
[01:32:10.807 --> 01:32:11.027]  Sir.
[01:32:11.308 --> 01:32:11.688]  Good, man.
[01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:12.508]  Thank you for calling.
[01:32:12.608 --> 01:32:12.808]  Hey.
[01:32:12.868 --> 01:32:13.148]  Hey.
[01:32:13.168 --> 01:32:17.650]  Um, I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:24.253]  Um, I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:32:24.373 --> 01:32:25.673]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:32.336]  Um, Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, um, take a shot of that.
[01:32:33.476 --> 01:32:34.597]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:32:34.657 --> 01:32:37.100]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.661]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:40.723]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:32:41.104 --> 01:32:41.844]  And exactly.
[01:32:41.864 --> 01:32:46.169]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:32:46.469 --> 01:32:46.729]  Boom!
[01:32:46.869 --> 01:32:49.712]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:32:49.772 --> 01:32:50.293]  It's amazing.
[01:32:50.353 --> 01:32:51.634]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:32:51.714 --> 01:32:54.597]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:07.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.779 --> 01:33:31.925]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.263 --> 01:33:44.105]  How do you know when a new Star Wars movie's coming out?
[01:33:44.425 --> 01:33:47.086]  How do you know when a new Mission Impossible's coming out, or a new Jurassic Park?
[01:33:47.487 --> 01:33:48.467]  Well, you see the ads everywhere.
[01:33:49.748 --> 01:33:53.450]  Democrats have been running around with their tongues hanging out.
[01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:55.231]  350 newspapers a day, front page coverage.
[01:33:55.331 --> 01:33:56.912]  Trump's gonna kill the media.
[01:33:57.252 --> 01:33:59.274]  Trump's sending people to shoot us and murder us.
[01:33:59.874 --> 01:34:05.818]  And they've got edited articles, never even showing any video, saying that I'm calling for battle rifles to be used on the press.
[01:34:06.755 --> 01:34:13.219]  When the video, we'll play it later, is me saying Antifa saying, we got bullets, we're coming to kill Republicans and Congress people.
[01:34:13.519 --> 01:34:19.202]  And I said, folks, if you're targeted by Antifa and been doxxed, whether you're law enforcement or Congress, you better have your battle rifle by your bed.
[01:34:19.662 --> 01:34:27.686]  That isn't, we're going to shoot the chi-coms and, you know, who are the good guys, of course, in all these articles, and Antifa and all the rest of it.
[01:34:28.147 --> 01:34:29.528]  This has to get to Trump.
[01:34:29.588 --> 01:34:33.530]  They get it in 95, they use the Oklahoma City bombing, it was totally synthetic.
[01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:39.478]  To bring in all the sympathy, to get their police state in place, and now they're getting ready to do it again.
[01:34:39.538 --> 01:34:41.902]  It's as plain as the nose on my face.
[01:34:42.022 --> 01:34:44.606]  And then they have all these hoax articles.
[01:34:45.751 --> 01:35:09.190]  Going where Jones was rated by the feds today and I woke up and like some radio station I never heard of it was off like a year ago of some micro I'm on little micro and pirate stations there all over the country and then I go Jones was rated his flagship which means where I broadcast from wow we were rated we're not broadcasting we're transmitting on satellite we produce the broadcast here
[01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:13.873]  We're on 50,000 watts, 100,000 watt FM's.
[01:35:13.913 --> 01:35:18.276]  We're getting 20, 30 new affiliates a week in TV and cable who are really exploding.
[01:35:18.696 --> 01:35:33.387]  This idea that there's some illegal station and the FCC shuts down Alex Jones' private flagship radio station, it shows the commitment of the idea that we're committing a crime and stations picking us up are committing a crime.
[01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:35.829]  Well, you may be able to fool your dumb readers.
[01:35:38.564 --> 01:35:43.089]  You're not going to be able to fool the people that run radio and TV stations.
[01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:45.791]  We got a bunch of calls today going, you were on at night, taped.
[01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:47.373]  I'm putting you on primetime.
[01:35:47.413 --> 01:35:48.274]  We get what's going on.
[01:35:48.334 --> 01:35:51.858]  I mean, the support is... When I just say that, it's the truth.
[01:35:52.967 --> 01:35:55.189]  Number one on the Android and the Apple.
[01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:57.210]  On the app from like number 40.
[01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:58.271]  We only launched it a month ago.
[01:35:58.871 --> 01:36:00.012]  Our new app, InfoWars Official.
[01:36:00.332 --> 01:36:02.213]  Number one all over the place.
[01:36:02.313 --> 01:36:05.655]  Millions of sign-ups for our free podcast at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:36:05.876 --> 01:36:06.716]  And I haven't plugged yet.
[01:36:06.736 --> 01:36:08.417]  We're an hour and 35 minutes into the show.
[01:36:08.978 --> 01:36:10.499]  And if I don't plug, we won't fund our operation.
[01:36:10.539 --> 01:36:12.540]  We have record sales going on, free shipping right now.
[01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:16.252]  You've got CNN saying ban me.
[01:36:16.633 --> 01:36:18.295]  They are desperate because I figured it out.
[01:36:18.335 --> 01:36:19.136]  We're not that important.
[01:36:20.117 --> 01:36:21.379]  I was big, but not that big.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.462]  They built me up to try to bring down Trump.
[01:36:25.484 --> 01:36:26.566]  They built me up to do that.
[01:36:26.826 --> 01:36:27.527]  It didn't work.
[01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:28.569]  It hurt Hillary.
[01:36:29.089 --> 01:36:31.452]  It gave Trump that real authentic populism.
[01:36:31.512 --> 01:36:32.294]  It made us bigger.
[01:36:33.646 --> 01:36:39.190]  Before Hillary, I was getting like 50 million, you know, visitors and listeners a week in the election.
[01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:41.372]  Then she called me dark heart and I went to like 80 something.
[01:36:41.412 --> 01:36:42.013]  I was like, whoa.
[01:36:42.373 --> 01:36:43.053]  And then they lost.
[01:36:43.073 --> 01:36:43.974]  They went even more pissed.
[01:36:43.994 --> 01:36:45.515]  So they built me up more as the devil.
[01:36:45.856 --> 01:36:48.157]  So then they, I mean, so it's a real paradox.
[01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:51.080]  Newtonian physics for every action, there's an opposite or equal reaction.
[01:36:52.836 --> 01:36:54.537]  I hear about my family and you and the First Amendment.
[01:36:55.018 --> 01:37:01.683]  Warner and all of them, I have the articles right here, I'm going to show them to you with Roger Stone, are saying they're going to ban everyone.
[01:37:02.124 --> 01:37:02.644]  They're coming.
[01:37:02.664 --> 01:37:03.945]  They want all conservatives banned.
[01:37:03.965 --> 01:37:05.587]  So they have this delusion of grandeur.
[01:37:05.847 --> 01:37:06.828]  They're going to remove Trump.
[01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:11.411]  They're going to stage some event against mainstream media or against tech giants to wave the bloody shirt.
[01:37:11.732 --> 01:37:13.893]  They're going to get their new Congress.
[01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:15.254]  They're going to ban free speech in it.
[01:37:15.274 --> 01:37:16.395]  Senator Warner has already said it.
[01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:18.690]  These people are arrogant though.
[01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:22.492]  They already had Newsweek printed up that she was going to win, you know, 2016.
[01:37:22.612 --> 01:37:27.155]  So we can beat this, but I'm telling you, just as sure as the sun came up.
[01:37:28.666 --> 01:37:29.787]  Just like Drudge Report gets it.
[01:37:29.947 --> 01:37:34.090]  He's linked to me pointing out that Lester Holt's a liar saying I said assault the media with battle rifles.
[01:37:34.210 --> 01:37:34.891]  Total fraud.
[01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:35.531]  No video.
[01:37:35.591 --> 01:37:35.992]  No link.
[01:37:36.052 --> 01:37:36.412]  No nothing.
[01:37:36.872 --> 01:37:39.334]  Thank you, Drudge, for preserving your own future and mine.
[01:37:39.414 --> 01:37:41.696]  God bless you for not being a coward.
[01:37:41.716 --> 01:37:42.396]  You are a hero.
[01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:45.839]  Everybody else, though, sitting by and watching to see what happens.
[01:37:45.879 --> 01:37:50.603]  But the new video we're uploading to InfoWars.com for the first hour I lay out the false flag plan.
[01:37:51.303 --> 01:37:52.744]  I'm going to lay out some of these others as well.
[01:37:53.184 --> 01:37:56.825]  You've got to get this out to everybody, because they want a silence.
[01:37:56.845 --> 01:38:03.728]  That's why they're doing this dangerous thing of kicking us off the air, banning us, lying about us, because something big's about to happen.
[01:38:03.768 --> 01:38:05.428]  And we know!
[01:38:05.488 --> 01:38:15.432]  350 papers they brag, published, that Trump's going to kill people in the media, and blood on his hands, and they say, I'm getting ready to kill the media, and I'm telling my listeners to kill the media when I never... I want the opposite!
[01:38:15.452 --> 01:38:18.273]  Don't make these dying dinosaur media people martyrs!
[01:38:18.734 --> 01:38:19.314]  They know that!
[01:38:20.134 --> 01:38:21.134]  So they want me silenced.
[01:38:21.434 --> 01:38:22.535]  They could false flag tomorrow.
[01:38:22.715 --> 01:38:23.755]  They could false flag next week.
[01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:25.016]  I'm telling you, before the election.
[01:38:25.576 --> 01:38:26.616]  I'd say probably September.
[01:38:26.636 --> 01:38:27.897]  Notice I have a letter from Google.
[01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:28.817]  Document Cam, shot please.
[01:38:29.917 --> 01:38:33.778]  From their vice president of the company, head of advertising of all of Google.
[01:38:33.858 --> 01:38:34.539]  Document Cam, shot.
[01:38:35.999 --> 01:38:36.639]  Wait, wait.
[01:38:36.659 --> 01:38:37.860]  I want to cover up our address here.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:38.480]  Excuse me.
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.160]  I had a blacked out version.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.021]  I guess I got this one.
[01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:44.822]  Excuse me.
[01:38:44.942 --> 01:38:45.162]  Go ahead.
[01:38:47.458 --> 01:38:48.639]  Look at that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:48.759 --> 01:38:53.642]  That right there is the vice president of Google, head of all marketing globally.
[01:38:53.662 --> 01:38:58.165]  And he says, September 10th, all of your files, everything's deleted off YouTube.
[01:38:58.185 --> 01:38:58.965]  They've already blocked us.
[01:38:59.866 --> 01:39:01.487]  September 11th's the next day, folks.
[01:39:01.527 --> 01:39:03.728]  They want us off the air before the big event.
[01:39:04.168 --> 01:39:05.129]  Roger Stone joins us.
[01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:06.430]  He'll be riding shotgun in the next hour.
[01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:08.091]  Then Mike Adams is on in about 15 after.
[01:39:09.532 --> 01:39:11.253]  We put out an emergency alert last night.
[01:39:12.403 --> 01:39:17.205]  Dealing with this, Roger, with all your political gravitas, do you have any doubt that they're getting ready to make their move?
[01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:25.548]  No, I think this could not be clearer what's afoot here, and that's why it's vitally important that people understand exactly what's going on.
[01:39:27.919 --> 01:39:29.019]  We renounce violence.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:30.480]  We do not advocate it.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.741]  We are not calling for violence against anyone.
[01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:42.724]  There will be an act of violence perpetrated by someone, and then they will seek to blame Alex Jones as if he, or we, or Infowars had something to do with it.
[01:39:42.804 --> 01:39:43.765]  Remember this, folks.
[01:39:43.805 --> 01:39:48.486]  When it goes down, and it will go down, we had nothing to do with it, we renounce it.
[01:39:49.146 --> 01:39:50.527]  This is a setup.
[01:39:50.567 --> 01:39:52.247]  This is a classic setup.
[01:39:52.287 --> 01:39:53.268]  You can smell it.
[01:39:54.609 --> 01:40:00.638]  And this idea that it is our fault, that we're advocating it, that we make it happen, it's the exact opposite.
[01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:04.924]  This is the very definition of a false flag as I know it, Alex.
[01:40:05.204 --> 01:40:10.252]  And I need to make that declaration clear, so when I come back we'll both make that declaration, and that we're not suicidal and all the rest of it.
[01:40:13.928 --> 01:40:22.878]  What do you make, you were even ranting about during the break, about this claim that our flagship station, some half-watt thing we didn't even know about that hadn't been on the air this year.
[01:40:23.139 --> 01:40:28.325]  I know this station very well because they used to broadcast from Brave New Books, which was a libertarian bookstore.
[01:40:28.385 --> 01:40:30.407]  See, see, I don't go out in public anymore, so tell me.
[01:40:30.467 --> 01:40:31.608]  You were telling me what it is.
[01:40:31.748 --> 01:40:33.450]  It's a tiny little pirate station.
[01:40:34.051 --> 01:40:37.375]  The people involved in the station all began fighting amongst each other.
[01:40:37.775 --> 01:40:42.059]  But the idea that this is Alex Jones's flagship station is a joke.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.724]  It's a tiny little pirate station that has been off the air since last December.
[01:40:47.025 --> 01:40:51.509]  And the fines referred to in the Hill today were levied well over a year ago.
[01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:54.371]  The whole story is the epitome.
[01:40:54.612 --> 01:40:58.974]  Okay, so fill me in, because literally, I knew Sheriff Frank, former sheriff, great guy.
[01:40:58.994 --> 01:41:01.976]  He was running, ended up on a hilltop that covered like half the city.
[01:41:02.276 --> 01:41:03.257]  He invited me over for dinner once.
[01:41:03.277 --> 01:41:05.138]  I was like, dude, the FCC's after you.
[01:41:05.198 --> 01:41:05.738]  Turn it off.
[01:41:06.419 --> 01:41:08.040]  And he turned it off when I asked him to.
[01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:09.921]  So it's the opposite.
[01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:12.603]  Like 10 years ago, this guy was like, dude, your wife just died.
[01:41:12.643 --> 01:41:13.103]  Don't do this.
[01:41:13.143 --> 01:41:13.803]  Don't do fines.
[01:41:14.964 --> 01:41:15.705]  So that's the truth.
[01:41:15.745 --> 01:41:17.806]  And then all these years later, this would pop up, that would pop up.
[01:41:17.866 --> 01:41:18.506]  I'm not watching.
[01:41:18.526 --> 01:41:20.888]  I don't even know half my big affiliates that are commercial.
[01:41:21.989 --> 01:41:33.083]  So, but this is clearly just to have this idea that I have illegal stations and I've been raided and it's some, I'm told some half watt thing that no one could even hear and then they're saying I've been illegally doing stuff.
[01:41:33.183 --> 01:41:38.990]  I don't think it's been on the air since last December as far as... So you've been coming for a lot of book signings and speeches.
[01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:40.051]  How did you know about this?
[01:41:40.071 --> 01:41:40.492]  Tell people.
[01:41:40.772 --> 01:41:43.334]  You know, I used to do book signings at Brave New Books.
[01:41:43.394 --> 01:41:44.595]  You did one with me there.
[01:41:44.615 --> 01:41:45.276]  It's closed now.
[01:41:46.336 --> 01:41:47.117]  Now out of business.
[01:41:47.397 --> 01:41:49.139]  And they used to broadcast out of there.
[01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:50.019]  They were nice folks.
[01:41:50.099 --> 01:41:52.101]  But then they all began fighting among each other.
[01:41:53.182 --> 01:41:57.545]  They had an affiliation with the Logos radio network at one time.
[01:41:57.645 --> 01:41:58.906]  I think that fell apart.
[01:41:59.747 --> 01:42:02.729]  But the idea that this is your flagship station is nonsense.
[01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.190]  Oh, that was out of Florida, right?
[01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:05.771]  No, it was out of Austin.
[01:42:05.791 --> 01:42:07.513]  But I heard Logos is in Florida.
[01:42:07.533 --> 01:42:10.355]  Logos, I think, is a network that's out of Florida.
[01:42:10.435 --> 01:42:13.317]  Well the point is, there's thousands of these around the country.
[01:42:13.798 --> 01:42:14.698]  Pirate Radio is well known.
[01:42:14.959 --> 01:42:19.142]  How the hell is some place over here me and I'm a criminal and my flagship is down?
[01:42:19.863 --> 01:42:22.625]  Here's what this station and Alex Jones have in common.
[01:42:23.105 --> 01:42:24.406]  They're both in Austin, Texas.
[01:42:24.806 --> 01:42:25.187]  That's it.
[01:42:25.667 --> 01:42:27.809]  This was not our flagship station, never was.
[01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:32.733]  They did evidently carry some pirated InfoWars content.
[01:42:32.793 --> 01:42:34.014]  Boy, I know that lady.
[01:42:34.034 --> 01:42:35.435]  She's an anti-fluoride activist.
[01:42:35.515 --> 01:42:36.816]  Yes, that's exactly her.
[01:42:36.936 --> 01:42:38.136]  Okay, I haven't even seen this yet.
[01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:38.536]  Okay.
[01:42:38.996 --> 01:42:41.697]  My God, this is... I'm sure they're good patrons that care about the truth.
[01:42:41.717 --> 01:42:42.478]  We love them.
[01:42:42.498 --> 01:42:43.498]  I mean, oh my God, how evil.
[01:42:43.518 --> 01:42:45.879]  That's some half-watt thing that covered a mile or something.
[01:42:46.179 --> 01:42:46.339]  Yeah.
[01:42:46.379 --> 01:42:47.119]  They're real devils.
[01:42:47.179 --> 01:42:48.620]  I tell you, well, we're illegal, folks.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:48.920]  You heard it.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:51.961]  And again, it's all about building that we're criminal, we're being taken off.
[01:42:52.281 --> 01:42:53.682]  Now the FCC's involved.
[01:42:53.942 --> 01:42:56.043]  Has to get big tech to cover to shut us down.
[01:42:56.243 --> 01:42:56.763]  Fake news.
[01:42:57.043 --> 01:42:57.543]  Fake news.
[01:42:57.783 --> 01:42:58.083]  Fake news.
[01:42:58.103 --> 01:42:59.404]  We'll talk about how to stop this straight ahead.
[01:43:05.475 --> 01:43:05.936]  Have you heard?
[01:43:06.416 --> 01:43:08.479]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:43:08.559 --> 01:43:09.861]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:43:10.041 --> 01:43:11.083]  They're all censoring us.
[01:43:11.443 --> 01:43:17.331]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:43:17.652 --> 01:43:20.676]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:43:31.604 --> 01:43:35.406]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:43:35.746 --> 01:43:42.390]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:47.413]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:43:47.693 --> 01:43:54.617]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system

[01:44:45.001 --> 01:45:00.554]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:45:02.879 --> 01:45:07.201]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[01:45:07.282 --> 01:45:08.022]  So I'm here.
[01:45:08.042 --> 01:45:08.622]  Hammering.
[01:45:09.062 --> 01:45:09.343]  Hammering.
[01:45:09.723 --> 01:45:10.083]  Hammering.
[01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:10.663]  Hammering.
[01:45:10.763 --> 01:45:12.064]  Stop the hammering.
[01:45:12.524 --> 01:45:14.005]  Stop the hammering out there.
[01:45:14.045 --> 01:45:14.886]  Who's got a hammer?
[01:45:15.166 --> 01:45:15.666]  Where is it?
[01:45:16.006 --> 01:45:16.306]  Hammering.
[01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:17.047]  Hammering.
[01:45:17.327 --> 01:45:17.707]  Hammering.
[01:45:17.987 --> 01:45:18.388]  Hammering.
[01:45:18.788 --> 01:45:19.688]  Where's the hammer?
[01:45:20.489 --> 01:45:22.330]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:24.571]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[01:45:24.771 --> 01:45:25.071]  Hammering.
[01:45:25.411 --> 01:45:25.792]  Hammering.
[01:45:26.092 --> 01:45:26.452]  Hammering.
[01:45:26.752 --> 01:45:27.112]  Hammering.
[01:45:27.413 --> 01:45:27.793]  Hammering.
[01:45:28.173 --> 01:45:29.794]  Stop the hammering.
[01:45:32.915 --> 01:45:34.235]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[01:45:34.255 --> 01:45:35.876]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.496]  Stop the hammering!
[01:45:37.777 --> 01:45:38.797]  Hammering, hammering.
[01:45:39.597 --> 01:45:43.858]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[01:45:44.419 --> 01:45:50.821]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[01:45:51.401 --> 01:45:53.441]  It just f***ing sucks.
[01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:58.023]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[01:45:58.723 --> 01:46:04.647]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control of everything.
[01:46:04.687 --> 01:46:05.067]  They're here.
[01:46:05.548 --> 01:46:08.450]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:09.230]  That's what I know.
[01:46:09.911 --> 01:46:12.993]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[01:46:13.393 --> 01:46:17.516]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure.
[01:46:17.796 --> 01:46:23.861]  At Infowarshore.com, standing with America, standing against the chi-coms in Hollywood, standing for victory and winning.
[01:46:24.041 --> 01:46:24.601]  Thanks to you.
[01:46:24.681 --> 01:46:25.162]  We'll be back.
[01:46:26.002 --> 01:46:29.084]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[01:46:29.124 --> 01:46:30.925]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[01:46:31.425 --> 01:46:35.107]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:46:35.267 --> 01:46:40.350]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:41.650]  And here's the best part.
[01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:43.411]  It is absolutely free.
[01:46:43.651 --> 01:46:48.514]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:46:48.874 --> 01:46:52.735]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[01:46:52.815 --> 01:46:54.376]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[01:46:54.676 --> 01:46:56.737]  Taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:46:56.937 --> 01:47:01.318]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:07.601]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:44.534 --> 01:47:46.936]  Well, Loretta Franklin's made the jump into hyperspace.
[01:47:46.956 --> 01:47:49.237]  A lot of great stuff.
[01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:51.759]  Going back to Roger Stone.
[01:47:51.779 --> 01:47:54.481]  I want to get right down to brass tacks.
[01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.582]  Let's go to the two-shot.
[01:47:56.622 --> 01:47:57.583]  I want to talk to Roger, please.
[01:48:03.927 --> 01:48:08.310]  Roger, we need to set the demarcation line right now, as we've always done over and over again.
[01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:09.851]  We are 100% against offensive
[01:48:12.506 --> 01:48:14.847]  Political violence, any other type of violence.
[01:48:14.887 --> 01:48:18.009]  We're winning culturally with ideas, with free market.
[01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:20.771]  It's the left and Antifa that wants violence.
[01:48:20.811 --> 01:48:24.153]  They're the ones, these rallies, saying bullets for Trump, bullets for Republicans.
[01:48:24.453 --> 01:48:25.894]  They're coming to people's houses to kill them.
[01:48:26.834 --> 01:48:34.379]  I say, members of Congress like Rand Paul and Scalise that are being targeted, they've been saying they're going to kill them, need to have a battle rifle.
[01:48:34.399 --> 01:48:35.820]  They need to have a gun in their house.
[01:48:37.179 --> 01:48:44.381]  That's what I said, and then Soros' Media Matters came out a few days ago and said that I said, attack the media, and Lester Holt and others went with that.
[01:48:45.362 --> 01:48:49.523]  And then they're doing all these other fake announcements, the FCC raided us and it's total hoax.
[01:48:50.483 --> 01:48:55.145]  Even the pirate radio we have no affiliate with, they claim they raided, never was raided and shut down a year ago.
[01:48:55.645 --> 01:48:57.465]  I mean, this is new level lying.
[01:48:57.505 --> 01:48:59.106]  This is Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:48:59.906 --> 01:49:04.287]  But I want to say, I'm against offensive violence because I like civilization.
[01:49:04.787 --> 01:49:07.948]  I'm against offensive violence because I've always done things
[01:49:09.226 --> 01:49:14.608]  Through political and societal ideas, and I've always been successful with my ideas.
[01:49:14.649 --> 01:49:19.591]  I didn't need to go conquer a woman over the head like the Islamists do and carry her off to a slave pit.
[01:49:19.631 --> 01:49:21.172]  I could pick up as many girls as I wanted to.
[01:49:21.192 --> 01:49:24.313]  I'm not bragging or anything, but I can get as many as I want, believe me.
[01:49:24.953 --> 01:49:26.194]  Before I was ever famous, I could.
[01:49:26.254 --> 01:49:32.757]  So I was always a free market guy, and so this idea that I'm going to get stuff through conquest or violence instead of through
[01:49:34.577 --> 01:49:39.100]  Renaissance is just absolutely insane and the left has broken the social contract.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.723]  They're saying big terror attacks are coming against Trump, against them, that Trump and that we are staging.
[01:49:45.944 --> 01:49:48.586]  Unequivocally, I disavow any violence.
[01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:49.966]  I've not called for violence.
[01:49:50.287 --> 01:49:53.729]  The media has edited or took out of context what I've said and framed it.
[01:49:53.809 --> 01:49:54.509]  They are frauds.
[01:49:54.549 --> 01:49:55.129]  They are liars.
[01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:56.810]  They are clearly preparing
[01:49:57.995 --> 01:50:04.685]  Some big event like Oklahoma City against mainstream media, big tech, or the government to demonize their opposition like they did in 95.
[01:50:05.246 --> 01:50:13.799]  Bill Clinton credited his come-from-behind win of the presidency in 96 to Oklahoma City on Air Force One to the press crew, to the press corps.
[01:50:14.983 --> 01:50:16.604]  So I disavow all violence.
[01:50:17.105 --> 01:50:18.206]  You disavow all violence.
[01:50:18.226 --> 01:50:20.948]  We wish the Antifa would stop their violence and call in for killing people.
[01:50:21.509 --> 01:50:23.090]  But I disavow offensive violence.
[01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:26.653]  I do not disavow defense, which is clearly under the Second Amendment.
[01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:33.779]  But the fact that they've gone to this level of lying, Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com, tells me that something wicked this way comes.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:37.042]  Alex, this is a classic setup.
[01:50:37.863 --> 01:50:39.184]  That's why we're here today.
[01:50:39.264 --> 01:50:42.266]  That's why we're telling people out front, right out front,
[01:50:43.067 --> 01:50:44.188]  We disavow violence.
[01:50:44.328 --> 01:50:53.156]  If something violent happens, if there's an attack on some reporter or some news bureau or some news outlet, if there is bloodshed, we are not behind that.
[01:50:53.256 --> 01:50:54.437]  We do not support that.
[01:50:54.517 --> 01:50:55.638]  We are not for that.
[01:50:56.078 --> 01:50:59.181]  That is what they call a classic false flag.
[01:50:59.601 --> 01:51:05.226]  So if tomorrow or next week or the week after that there is an assault on some media outlet,
[01:51:06.127 --> 01:51:07.449]  We had nothing to do with that.
[01:51:07.829 --> 01:51:14.076]  And anyone who says Alex Jones fomented it, or advocated it, or pushed it, or arranged it, is lying.
[01:51:14.216 --> 01:51:15.477]  It's the big lie.
[01:51:15.778 --> 01:51:16.759]  You heard it here, folks.
[01:51:17.159 --> 01:51:18.761]  This is the line of demarcation.
[01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:21.203]  We're out ahead of this because we can smell it.
[01:51:21.784 --> 01:51:22.465]  It's a setup.
[01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:24.006]  And it all began months ago.
[01:51:24.807 --> 01:51:50.843]  First, they take things you say, they distort them, they twist them, they take them out of context, then they use them as the basis for phony harassment, but expensive lawsuits, then they file those lawsuits to generate headlines, then they take those distorted headlines and they use them as the excuse to take us off the air, to stop our ability to communicate with you directly,
[01:51:51.463 --> 01:51:57.750]  And then they seek to blame us for violence that they will be responsible for and that we have nothing to do with.
[01:51:58.991 --> 01:51:59.792]  It's a formula.
[01:51:59.912 --> 01:52:01.794]  It's a step-by-step formula.
[01:52:02.235 --> 01:52:04.217]  And now you know exactly what's coming.
[01:52:04.698 --> 01:52:10.304]  So when it goes down, come back to this recording, come back to this tape, come back to this video.
[01:52:10.484 --> 01:52:12.226]  You will know exactly what went down.
[01:52:12.626 --> 01:52:14.727]  We have nothing to do with violence.
[01:52:14.807 --> 01:52:16.548]  We do not advocate violence.
[01:52:17.008 --> 01:52:20.049]  Violence, in all honesty, would be counterproductive.
[01:52:20.469 --> 01:52:22.670]  We are winning the war of ideas.
[01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:30.754]  We believe in an intellectual struggle, a political struggle, a struggle for the electorate, a struggle for the hearts and minds of the American people.
[01:52:30.774 --> 01:52:33.055]  A struggle to bring the economy back, and we've been proven right.
[01:52:33.675 --> 01:52:43.160]  And that's what's so clear here is, the unified discipline, is what I've called it, of the media to lie about you, to lie and say Trump hates all Mexicans, there is no such quote, all of these are lies.
[01:52:44.021 --> 01:52:54.207]  And even the LA Times, it's on drugreport.com, LA Times rebukes groupthink, says it's insane that 350 outlets denounce President's attacks on media, claim he's calling for violence.
[01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:58.272]  Says Chicago Tribune op-ed written by Dog.
[01:52:59.153 --> 01:53:00.754]  I mean, this is just insane.
[01:53:01.054 --> 01:53:02.315]  And I read the local one today.
[01:53:02.355 --> 01:53:03.696]  It's like Trump's calling for violence.
[01:53:03.936 --> 01:53:05.077]  The blood's on his hands.
[01:53:05.637 --> 01:53:07.239]  They are going crazy.
[01:53:07.739 --> 01:53:09.400]  And again, they're saying he wants violence.
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:12.662]  No, when they lie about him and say he's a Nazi, he says you're fake news.
[01:53:12.983 --> 01:53:16.885]  When they lie about him and say he didn't get us up to a 4% growth rate, he says you're fake news.
[01:53:17.346 --> 01:53:19.928]  When they lie about him, I mean, they just, it's incredible.
[01:53:21.048 --> 01:53:21.409]  But again,
[01:53:22.526 --> 01:53:23.367]  I'm not that important.
[01:53:23.687 --> 01:53:28.610]  They have chosen us to demonize us as the beta test, Roger, ahead of the big event.
[01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:30.431]  Undoubtedly, they're planting a false flag.
[01:53:31.071 --> 01:53:41.298]  And I just want folks to know, they want to silence us first so we can be demonized and they can project things onto us during the false flag.
[01:53:42.078 --> 01:53:42.739]  You're absolutely right.
[01:53:42.759 --> 01:53:44.019]  That's why we've got to get this out.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.740]  People, this is D-Day.
[01:53:45.801 --> 01:53:46.261]  This is it.
[01:53:47.034 --> 01:53:56.368]  Right now there's a federal grand jury in Washington trying to frame me on some kind of defrauding the United States charge for which they have no evidence whatsoever.
[01:53:56.608 --> 01:53:56.989]  Why?
[01:53:57.409 --> 01:54:03.238]  Because they don't want me out there pointing out what's about to happen because it is their way of silencing me.
[01:54:03.678 --> 01:54:18.289]  Just as they're trying to silence Alex Jones and Infowars, and they're trying to silence me on this platform where I do the War Room every day at 5 o'clock Eastern, proud to do it with Owen Schroyer, growing audience, record number of people signing up for the podcast since their move on us.
[01:54:18.969 --> 01:54:21.852]  This is part and parcel of the same exact thing.
[01:54:36.306 --> 01:54:37.687]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:54:37.847 --> 01:54:41.169]  I can tell you folks, I'm in the studio right here in Austin.
[01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:43.370]  There was no raid, there is no raid.
[01:54:43.771 --> 01:54:46.472]  We don't have a flagship radio station that's a pirate station.
[01:54:46.492 --> 01:54:47.453]  We don't broadcast.
[01:54:47.533 --> 01:54:49.074]  We send out a transmission.
[01:54:49.134 --> 01:54:50.115]  We're the producer.
[01:54:50.675 --> 01:54:51.375]  By satellite.
[01:54:52.016 --> 01:54:54.377]  They're even talking about antiquated technology.
[01:54:54.918 --> 01:54:58.160]  You know, it's disappointing, Alex, because The Hill, generally speaking,
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:54:59.421]  Pretty accurate.
[01:54:59.441 --> 01:55:02.324]  I mean, of all the mainstream media... Unless they're attacking me.
[01:55:02.724 --> 01:55:07.509]  Every once in a while you get a bad story there, but by and large I think they have some journalistic integrity.
[01:55:08.009 --> 01:55:09.491]  They need to pull this story down.
[01:55:09.731 --> 01:55:10.852]  It is false.
[01:55:10.992 --> 01:55:14.856]  Somebody has fed them completely incorrect, inaccurate information.
[01:55:14.876 --> 01:55:18.500]  Well, when you read, like, the CBS article, and then on Facebook, it's like, take him down!
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:19.381]  No, he's illegal.
[01:55:19.441 --> 01:55:19.941]  Ban him.
[01:55:20.401 --> 01:55:22.743]  The idea is just Alex Jones is illegal.
[01:55:22.863 --> 01:55:23.063]  What?
[01:55:23.424 --> 01:55:25.805]  We don't have any radio stations I own.
[01:55:25.825 --> 01:55:27.406]  We're on hundreds of commercial stations.
[01:55:27.767 --> 01:55:30.369]  I can hardly sign all the agreements, all the TV and radio stations.
[01:55:30.389 --> 01:55:31.129]  We're exploding.
[01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:37.014]  So their answer to that is, oh, a pirate somewhere that was off a year ago picked him up.
[01:55:37.094 --> 01:55:37.894]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:55:37.934 --> 01:55:38.675]  He's been fined.
[01:55:38.935 --> 01:55:39.716]  And you read the article?
[01:55:40.805 --> 01:55:43.126]  It says they find these people a year ago.
[01:55:43.366 --> 01:55:44.647]  Right, and it has nothing to do with us.
[01:55:44.927 --> 01:55:45.787]  Not even remotely.
[01:55:45.907 --> 01:55:50.949]  I didn't even, once you said what it was in Brave New Books, they pulled it up and I said, oh, I've met that lady a few times.
[01:55:50.969 --> 01:55:52.630]  She's a fluoride, anti-fluoride activist.
[01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:56.692]  Yeah, the whole thing is, it's a construction, it's a fabrication.
[01:55:56.912 --> 01:56:03.018]  I mean like I'm running around worried about what half a watt stations are doing when I can't even call the program directors.
[01:56:03.458 --> 01:56:09.323]  We've got over 20 stations that are 50,000 watt AM mega torches that cover multi-states.
[01:56:09.363 --> 01:56:11.545]  They asked me to come to LA, you name it.
[01:56:11.846 --> 01:56:14.008]  They asked me to come out, I can't come out and speak to their groups.
[01:56:14.028 --> 01:56:15.209]  Limbaugh used to do it, I should.
[01:56:15.729 --> 01:56:20.631]  I mean, I've got 50,000-watt mega-goblin stations.
[01:56:20.711 --> 01:56:22.912]  We barely have time to tape the liners.
[01:56:23.552 --> 01:56:24.092]  Are you kidding?
[01:56:24.112 --> 01:56:26.093]  I've got a month of them and the stations are pissed!
[01:56:26.473 --> 01:56:29.274]  So, this is... W this, K that!
[01:56:29.334 --> 01:56:33.096]  I mean... 50-plus new cable and TV stations in the last two weeks.
[01:56:33.636 --> 01:56:41.420]  And what's interesting is that since the ban, if you go back and look, and I've done the research, our listenership is up on every one of them.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:46.682]  Listen, station owners particularly know how this works, and they know we're already, they already know we can't even respond to them.
[01:56:47.123 --> 01:56:49.484]  And they're like, oh, you're worried about some half-watt station?
[01:56:49.824 --> 01:56:50.444]  Baloney!
[01:56:51.125 --> 01:56:54.886]  Listen, we have almost 280 stations.
[01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:58.348]  You can buy them all, I don't know how many, 50,000, 1,000, 5,000, they're all special.
[01:56:58.708 --> 01:56:59.909]  Some are 100,000 watt FM's.
[01:57:00.409 --> 01:57:01.810]  You can buy them all, we're talking about
[01:57:03.629 --> 01:57:04.570]  Millions of watts!
[01:57:05.211 --> 01:57:09.237]  And I'm worried about a half... And I love little stations that reach neighborhoods or whatever, whatever micros.
[01:57:09.518 --> 01:57:11.721]  The point is, I think it's Americana if you don't interfere with commercials.
[01:57:13.346 --> 01:57:13.686]  You're right.
[01:57:13.767 --> 01:57:14.828]  It's just insane, Roger.
[01:57:15.508 --> 01:57:17.530]  Well, it's part of a larger plan.
[01:57:17.590 --> 01:57:22.114]  And I think we've been very clear about outlining exactly how this plan works.
[01:57:22.195 --> 01:57:23.115]  So let me ask you this when we come back.
[01:57:23.696 --> 01:57:24.517]  How do we counter it?
[01:57:24.597 --> 01:57:25.538]  What do you think they're planning next?
[01:57:25.598 --> 01:57:27.039]  And how do we get Trump to move?
[01:57:27.079 --> 01:57:33.325]  Because Trump, they're all over the news saying you're going to kill people at CNN with no proof when they're the ones calling for violence.
[01:57:33.525 --> 01:57:34.526]  And they're saying I am too.
[01:57:35.547 --> 01:57:36.407]  So, there's the New York Times.
[01:57:36.427 --> 01:57:37.308]  You'll have blood on your hands.
[01:57:37.368 --> 01:57:38.568]  They are gearing up.
[01:57:38.668 --> 01:57:40.289]  They are planning something big.
[01:57:40.329 --> 01:57:41.049]  A false flag.
[01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:42.629]  Patriots in the government.
[01:57:42.670 --> 01:57:43.670]  We have to stop this.
[01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:44.930]  Everybody have your cameras ready.
[01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:46.411]  Be frosty, man.
[01:57:46.451 --> 01:57:47.871]  They do not want us on air talking about this.
[01:57:48.091 --> 01:57:49.472]  This is bigger than the China issue.
[01:57:51.032 --> 01:57:54.414]  Trump is representing America, like he's for the United States.
[01:57:55.174 --> 01:57:56.954]  I am so sorry, sir.
[01:57:56.974 --> 01:57:58.095]  I tried to stop him.
[01:57:58.115 --> 01:57:59.555]  Not your fault.
[01:57:59.595 --> 01:58:01.316]  You can't stop a man who just 36.
[01:58:01.376 --> 01:58:02.036]  Greyhound.
[01:58:02.156 --> 01:58:02.636]  End to end.
[01:58:02.856 --> 01:58:04.117]  It's all right, Lucy.
[01:58:08.268 --> 01:58:13.216]  Mr. Bank, do you know what Chuck Berry said every night before counting 1, 2, 3, 4?
[01:58:13.496 --> 01:58:17.202]  What did he say?
[01:58:17.583 --> 01:58:18.304]  Pay me my money!
[01:58:19.804 --> 01:58:22.266]  Well, I'm sure my people will be in cash.
[01:58:40.579 --> 01:58:42.741]  And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.
[01:58:42.761 --> 01:58:44.763]  Now, this has been going on for decades.
[01:58:45.404 --> 01:58:53.051]  This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved.
[01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:56.934]  But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country.
[01:58:56.974 --> 01:58:58.516]  It's very unfair to our taxpayers.
[01:58:59.536 --> 01:59:04.160]  And I think that these countries have to step it up, not over a 10 year period, they have to step it up immediately.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.862]  Germany is a rich country.
[01:59:06.362 --> 01:59:09.805]  They talk about they can increase it a tiny bit by 2030.
[01:59:11.626 --> 01:59:16.090]  Well, they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no problem.
[01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:18.071]  I don't think it's fair to the United States.
[01:59:18.151 --> 01:59:21.854]  So we're going to have to do something because we're not going to put up with it.
[01:59:21.935 --> 01:59:22.835]  We can't put up with it.
[01:59:23.015 --> 01:59:24.717]  And it's inappropriate.
[01:59:28.584 --> 01:59:31.586]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[01:59:32.607 --> 01:59:37.211]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[01:59:37.811 --> 01:59:40.593]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[01:59:41.154 --> 01:59:44.976]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[01:59:45.597 --> 01:59:46.638]  I wouldn't support that group.
[01:59:46.938 --> 01:59:47.238]  Would you?
[01:59:47.258 --> 01:59:50.180]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com
[01:59:55.762 --> 01:59:58.975]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:07.122 --> 02:00:08.683]  We're back live, Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.703 --> 02:00:09.924]  We can just get out of this line of music.
[02:00:09.965 --> 02:00:11.926]  Roger Stone here with me for another segment.
[02:00:12.006 --> 02:00:13.367]  Or two.
[02:00:13.427 --> 02:00:14.468]  And then Mike Adams is coming.
[02:00:14.488 --> 02:00:15.990]  He'll co-host with you in the fourth hour.
[02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:18.051]  But Mike will be here with us for 45 minutes.
[02:00:18.352 --> 02:00:19.172]  The false flag's here.
[02:00:19.212 --> 02:00:19.893]  We gotta stop it.
[02:00:20.293 --> 02:00:21.594]  Clearly they're getting ready to rig it all.
[02:00:21.615 --> 02:00:24.757]  If you go to InfoWars.com, we put up an emergency splash page.
[02:00:24.777 --> 02:00:34.446]  I got the idea when we were hacked the other day, but we can put up a splash page where I have the video, fake news, Alex Jones responds to Lester Holt's claim that he is calling for violence against the media.
[02:00:35.306 --> 02:00:38.047]  And it's no big deal to the crew, but that's not the headline I wanted.
[02:00:38.107 --> 02:00:40.969]  It's the one that's actually on MFullWars.com.
[02:00:41.909 --> 02:00:44.651]  The DrugsReport.com is linked to it.
[02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:46.111]  I say Lester Holt is lying.
[02:00:46.131 --> 02:00:48.533]  I am not falling.
[02:00:48.553 --> 02:00:51.594]  So we had that meeting this morning and I said change it and whatever.
[02:00:51.854 --> 02:00:53.335]  I say it on air, it seems to happen.
[02:00:53.355 --> 02:00:55.316]  This is where I kind of communicate to the crew here.
[02:00:55.336 --> 02:00:57.157]  You can see it on DrugsReport.com.
[02:00:57.237 --> 02:00:59.258]  Alex Jones, blatant lies being told about me.
[02:01:00.418 --> 02:01:03.900]  And then there's the headline I want for Infowars.com.
[02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:05.040]  Video.
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:05.740]  That's why I wrote it.
[02:01:06.341 --> 02:01:07.441]  Lester Holt is a liar.
[02:01:07.521 --> 02:01:09.702]  Alex Jones did not call for violence.
[02:01:11.103 --> 02:01:14.084]  But here's what's more important for the splash page on Infowars.com.
[02:01:14.744 --> 02:01:15.865]  I am going to
[02:01:17.892 --> 02:01:19.052]  Nothing more important than that.
[02:01:36.843 --> 02:01:37.644]  Turn this mic on please.
[02:01:37.704 --> 02:01:42.187]  It's absolutely crucial for info warriors out there to help us while we're under siege.
[02:01:42.667 --> 02:01:43.468]  Take this link.
[02:01:43.888 --> 02:01:45.489]  When this comes up, take this link.
[02:01:45.889 --> 02:01:48.171]  Go to everyone in your contact list on email.
[02:01:48.431 --> 02:01:50.653]  Go to everyone in your contact list on Facebook.
[02:01:50.933 --> 02:01:53.014]  Go to everyone in your contact list on Twitter.
[02:01:53.274 --> 02:01:56.957]  Go to everyone in your contact list on Instagram and get this out.
[02:01:57.437 --> 02:02:01.220]  They can silence us perhaps, but they cannot silence all of us.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.200]  You're an army of one.
[02:02:03.041 --> 02:02:09.285]  We really need your help here to spread the truth in the face of these blatant lies and this setup.
[02:02:09.705 --> 02:02:12.306]  Remember, folks, we are not for violence.
[02:02:12.627 --> 02:02:13.927]  We renounce violence.
[02:02:14.348 --> 02:02:16.129]  We are not advocating violence.
[02:02:16.389 --> 02:02:18.050]  We are not arranging for violence.
[02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:26.535]  The only other thing I have to say, having watched that video with Lester Holt and Jack Dorsey, is Jack, lose the nose ring, okay, dude?
[02:02:26.575 --> 02:02:27.535]  It's not a good look.
[02:02:29.416 --> 02:02:29.977]  Absolutely.
[02:02:32.449 --> 02:02:33.491]  We're going to break it all down.
[02:02:34.132 --> 02:02:36.756]  They've got the censored reports they don't want you to see on Infowars.com.
[02:02:39.324 --> 02:02:40.344]  Censored emergency report.
[02:02:40.424 --> 02:02:43.705]  Alex Jones vindicated after massive institutional pedophile ring busted.
[02:02:44.046 --> 02:02:44.846]  I put that on Twitter.
[02:02:44.866 --> 02:02:45.426]  They banned it.
[02:02:45.806 --> 02:02:46.446]  It's mainstream news.
[02:02:46.466 --> 02:02:47.347]  They just don't want you to know.
[02:02:47.847 --> 02:02:49.967]  Exclusive meet Donald Trump's secret black girlfriend.
[02:02:50.007 --> 02:02:50.928]  Roger Stone tells all.
[02:02:51.388 --> 02:02:51.888]  Go there.
[02:02:51.988 --> 02:02:52.908]  Get those videos.
[02:02:53.529 --> 02:02:54.569]  Upload them.
[02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:55.089]  Download them.
[02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:57.310]  Upload them to your own Twitter, your own Facebook, your own whatever.
[02:02:57.330 --> 02:02:58.250]  Send it out on your own email.
[02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:00.451]  Send our link, Infowars.com, out.
[02:03:00.491 --> 02:03:01.551]  It's really backfired.
[02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:06.553]  We've got to keep this wave going because they're hitting us harder, trying to convince the feds to raid us.
[02:03:07.433 --> 02:03:12.055]  So it's getting crazy, and again, exclusive Alex Jones response to Lester Holt's claim that he's calling for violence.
[02:03:12.075 --> 02:03:17.738]  We're going to change that headline to what I wanted yesterday, and they put up a wrong headline, and it kept going today, and I've been on my knees.
[02:03:17.958 --> 02:03:23.501]  Literally, I hit a knee and I said, I want video Lester Holt's a liar, Alex Jones did not call for violence.
[02:03:23.641 --> 02:03:26.343]  I'm on my knees to this crew.
[02:03:26.723 --> 02:03:28.224]  On my knees.
[02:03:30.014 --> 02:03:32.775]  I guess I got bloodlet on air or something to just get that up.
[02:03:32.815 --> 02:03:34.656]  And then we're going to get up the video.
[02:03:35.117 --> 02:03:35.937]  I gave them the headline other.
[02:03:35.997 --> 02:03:36.557]  I love everybody.
[02:03:36.577 --> 02:03:38.078]  They asked me an hour later, what's the headline?
[02:03:38.118 --> 02:03:38.799]  I'll come up with it again.
[02:03:39.339 --> 02:03:39.799]  And I'm not mad.
[02:03:39.839 --> 02:03:41.780]  I'm just kind of getting crazy here in the trenches.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:42.941]  War crazed.
[02:03:43.041 --> 02:03:46.002]  It's just that, I mean, Alex Jones warns of the impending false flag.
[02:03:46.022 --> 02:03:49.344]  It's going to be used to blame conservatives and throw the election.
[02:03:49.624 --> 02:03:50.865]  And this is the big October surprise.
[02:03:50.885 --> 02:03:51.465]  Let me ask you that.
[02:03:51.505 --> 02:03:52.286]  We come back, Roger.
[02:03:52.326 --> 02:03:52.726]  Think about it.
[02:03:55.908 --> 02:03:56.708]  This is so real.
[02:03:56.748 --> 02:03:57.689]  People don't take this serious.
[02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:58.269]  We're done, folks.
[02:03:59.639 --> 02:03:59.839]  Go ahead.
[02:04:00.279 --> 02:04:01.200]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.240]  This is a precursor for 2018 and 2020.
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:06.581]  They look, they know they lost control of the narrative.
[02:04:07.021 --> 02:04:11.643]  They know that their monopoly control on political discourse in this country was broken in 2016.
[02:04:12.123 --> 02:04:15.424]  This is an effort to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[02:04:15.544 --> 02:04:16.785]  And who is the cutting edge?
[02:04:17.145 --> 02:04:22.326]  Who is the one person with the courage and the fortitude to be out there on the cutting edge and saying what nobody else will say?
[02:04:22.667 --> 02:04:24.127]  It's Alex Jones and Infowars.
[02:04:24.527 --> 02:04:26.468]  But folks, we are the test case.
[02:04:27.208 --> 02:04:28.069]  It's not just us.
[02:04:28.089 --> 02:04:29.491]  This isn't a fight about us.
[02:04:29.951 --> 02:04:40.223]  Because Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and Mike Savage and Rush Limbaugh... Senator Warner and Senator Murphy say, when we come back, they're shutting everyone down.
[02:04:42.245 --> 02:04:43.346]  Oh, the crew's doing a great job.
[02:04:43.386 --> 02:04:44.728]  I'm just really pissed and focused.
[02:04:45.068 --> 02:04:50.753]  And we're going to upload soon this video on the imminent false flag that everybody's got to have go megaviral.
[02:04:51.034 --> 02:04:54.857]  We've got to get out ahead of it, and it may stop them from doing it, but it worked in 95.
[02:04:55.158 --> 02:04:56.619]  The same Clinton cabal runs it.
[02:04:56.999 --> 02:04:58.261]  The Clintons did Oklahoma City.
[02:04:58.281 --> 02:04:59.322]  They're planning to do it again.
[02:05:02.196 --> 02:05:06.379]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:06.539 --> 02:05:11.582]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[02:06:03.894 --> 02:06:10.038]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:10.398 --> 02:06:12.519]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:14.801 --> 02:06:16.682]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.782 --> 02:06:20.464]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:29.993 --> 02:06:31.616]  We're good.
[02:07:02.398 --> 02:07:06.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are moving on all fronts against humanity right now.
[02:07:06.222 --> 02:07:07.444]  Roger Stones in studio with me.
[02:07:07.484 --> 02:07:09.406]  Mike Adams coming in with huge breaking news.
[02:07:09.926 --> 02:07:11.828]  You are unstoppable when you spread the live links.
[02:07:11.888 --> 02:07:13.590]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:14.031 --> 02:07:15.893]  You're unstoppable when you're aware of what's happening.
[02:07:16.353 --> 02:07:19.537]  Here are the articles you didn't know that are happening right now.
[02:07:21.619 --> 02:07:25.420]  CNN article accuses Infowars of being complicit in domestic terror.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:28.821]  No proof, no links, because they're getting ready to stage the terror attacks.
[02:07:29.801 --> 02:07:30.402]  Absolutely.
[02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:30.722]  Go ahead.
[02:07:31.122 --> 02:07:40.485]  If you are just tuning in, folks, you may have seen a story that says the flagship station in Austin that broadcasts Alex Jones has been raided and shut down.
[02:07:40.845 --> 02:07:41.905]  100% fake news.
[02:07:42.565 --> 02:07:44.086]  We don't even broadcast that way.
[02:07:44.126 --> 02:07:45.486]  We're uplinked by satellite.
[02:07:45.646 --> 02:07:53.794]  And it turns out a year ago there was some half a watt thing that he'd been in a bookstore and seen it covered a mile and they say that's me to say I'm being shut down I'm illegal.
[02:07:54.035 --> 02:07:59.300]  They're trying to push that to totally shut us down which means the false flag is imminent.
[02:07:59.941 --> 02:08:01.602]  It is a classic case of fake news.
[02:08:01.663 --> 02:08:04.646]  If you see that story out there because it will be picked up now and reported.
[02:08:04.666 --> 02:08:06.327]  You see that's how the fake news works.
[02:08:07.328 --> 02:08:13.853]  One fake news outlet posts something and then a dozen others grab it and recycle it as if it's true.
[02:08:14.194 --> 02:08:21.799]  So if you see this story about our radio station, our flagship station in Austin being raided, it is 100% false.
[02:08:21.879 --> 02:08:22.740]  It never happened.
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:29.145]  This station's been off the air for over a year and they were fined over a year ago and they have nothing to do with us at InfoWallet.
[02:08:30.586 --> 02:08:33.529]  Like you said, it was like a little... Like a mom and pop!
[02:08:33.609 --> 02:08:35.931]  A little bitty chip you put in the computer.
[02:08:35.991 --> 02:08:36.191]  Right.
[02:08:36.392 --> 02:08:38.393]  It's like something that covers a block.
[02:08:38.433 --> 02:08:38.854]  But look at this.
[02:08:39.394 --> 02:08:42.878]  CNN article accuses Infowars of being complicit in domestic terror.
[02:08:44.199 --> 02:08:49.123]  Secret Democrats, Senate Democrats are circulating plan for government takeover of the internet.
[02:08:49.163 --> 02:08:49.764]  Now it's public.
[02:08:50.545 --> 02:08:51.966]  Senate Democrats are circulating the plan.
[02:08:51.986 --> 02:08:52.427]  There's reason.
[02:08:53.237 --> 02:08:56.578]  There's Senator Warner admitting he wants all conservatives shut down.
[02:08:56.938 --> 02:08:59.339]  Senator Murphy saying similar things.
[02:08:59.379 --> 02:09:01.579]  Democenters demand more censorship of conservatives.
[02:09:01.619 --> 02:09:04.120]  These companies must do more than take down Infowars.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:06.060]  This is insane.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:12.642]  And now they're claiming we have illegal radio stations and have been raided to create the idea we're like cocaine or something.
[02:09:13.762 --> 02:09:14.723]  That story's a joke.
[02:09:15.063 --> 02:09:15.603]  It's just a joke.
[02:09:15.623 --> 02:09:17.823]  Well I bring that up to show every day.
[02:09:17.983 --> 02:09:19.924]  Listen, I confirm with Mike Adams who's coming in.
[02:09:21.226 --> 02:09:23.086]  And a bunch of other former employees and people.
[02:09:24.267 --> 02:09:30.088]  The New York Times, others call them up, they go, I want to do a big front page article on you, we love you so much, and you're so big, and you're so great.
[02:09:31.128 --> 02:09:35.529]  And when they say, no, I won't lie about Alex Jones, they call back and threaten him, going, we got dirt on you, you better say stuff about him.
[02:09:35.929 --> 02:09:36.909]  People tell him, F off.
[02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:42.250]  But the New York Times only acts like that when they're doing WMD fakes or about to invade a country.
[02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:44.890]  They're owned by the, you know, Kingpin Carlos Slim.
[02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:48.411]  But I mean, the fact, Roger, that they are now threatening people.
[02:09:48.968 --> 02:09:51.452]  We're going to have a witness come in in a minute and talk about this just yesterday.
[02:09:51.832 --> 02:09:53.114]  Threatening their employees!
[02:09:53.976 --> 02:10:00.185]  I mean, and I sat there with these New York Times reporters, I let her know who she was, this steel lady, in the courtroom when they were trying to take my kids a few weeks ago.
[02:10:00.266 --> 02:10:00.686]  It failed.
[02:10:01.548 --> 02:10:02.329]  And this woman was just going...
[02:10:06.158 --> 02:10:09.281]  I mean, it looked like a space alien met a, you know, ugly woman.
[02:10:09.781 --> 02:10:15.446]  And I'm just, and then she writes articles about this corporation had a pool party and there were women in bikinis and they should be shut down.
[02:10:16.007 --> 02:10:18.369]  I mean, these people are crazy, man!
[02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:22.592]  Well, Alex, I do need to ask you this one key question, because I know the New York Times confronted you with this.
[02:10:23.213 --> 02:10:24.854]  How long have you been on the Russian payroll?
[02:10:25.215 --> 02:10:25.935]  They actually asked me that.
[02:10:25.955 --> 02:10:27.476]  How long have you been working for RT?
[02:10:27.557 --> 02:10:30.139]  They said, how long have you been working with RT and getting paid?
[02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:31.680]  And I went, I've never been.
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.542]  They're like, you're right.
[02:10:34.991 --> 02:10:35.732]  Well let him write that.
[02:10:36.052 --> 02:10:37.394]  That's a lawsuit in the making.
[02:10:37.714 --> 02:10:41.658]  But the thing is they're not, they don't care about lawsuits now because they think they're taking over.
[02:10:41.678 --> 02:10:42.359]  Do you understand that?
[02:10:42.679 --> 02:10:45.602]  They have an authoritarian plan on the other side of this internet takeover.
[02:10:45.983 --> 02:10:49.206]  So there's only one person on the face of the planet who can stop this.
[02:10:49.727 --> 02:10:52.710]  One person who needs to wake up because he's the ultimate target.
[02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:54.993]  Let's stop there because I'm going to put this out as a five minute clip.
[02:10:56.634 --> 02:10:59.816]  Let's be as clear about this as we possibly can.
[02:10:59.856 --> 02:11:00.377]  It is internet freedom.
[02:11:00.437 --> 02:11:00.997]  It is the rise of a robust
[02:11:17.648 --> 02:11:22.873]  A vigorous alternative media through the internet that allowed Donald Trump to become president.
[02:11:23.373 --> 02:11:27.557]  And now his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube.
[02:11:27.997 --> 02:11:35.663]  They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC and CBS controlled the political dialogue.
[02:11:36.164 --> 02:11:39.807]  Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.
[02:11:40.507 --> 02:11:42.769]  This is a threat to the Trump presidency.
[02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:45.811]  This is a threat to Republican control of the Congress.
[02:11:46.151 --> 02:11:48.312]  This is a threat to our democracy.
[02:11:49.033 --> 02:11:50.774]  Only the President can stop this.
[02:11:51.254 --> 02:12:01.021]  He can quite simply order his Assistant Attorney General, pardon me, Deputy Attorney General for Antitrust to bring an immediate action against those who are censoring us.
[02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:03.623]  Because if it is Alex Jones today,
[02:12:04.525 --> 02:12:13.970]  It is Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and Mike Savage and Rush Limbaugh and other great patriots that I admire who are next.
[02:12:14.411 --> 02:12:16.492]  Don't think that this is all about Infowars.
[02:12:16.752 --> 02:12:18.573]  Don't think this is all about Alex Jones.
[02:12:18.993 --> 02:12:20.194]  This is about our future.
[02:12:20.494 --> 02:12:24.456]  Donald Trump needs to understand what's going on here and stand tall.
[02:12:24.777 --> 02:12:26.438]  And the time is now.
[02:12:26.598 --> 02:12:30.000]  Well this is the big move, Roger, and they admit Warner
[02:12:31.132 --> 02:12:33.794]  And Murphy and others say, we're going to ban all conservatives.
[02:12:34.495 --> 02:12:37.397]  Barry Diller's bragging next year we'll be conservative free.
[02:12:38.017 --> 02:12:39.118]  They've made the decision.
[02:12:39.158 --> 02:12:41.680]  They're crazy enough to do this.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.564]  This is like the Soviet Union invading, you know, Poland or something.
[02:12:47.624 --> 02:12:51.627]  I mean, this is like completely crazy.
[02:12:51.687 --> 02:12:53.168]  I can't believe they're this bold, Roger.
[02:12:53.528 --> 02:12:59.052]  Well, you know, if you go back to election night right here at this very desk, you called this.
[02:13:00.031 --> 02:13:05.315]  When I was celebrating with Champagne, you were saying, this isn't the end, this is just the beginning.
[02:13:05.415 --> 02:13:06.756]  And you called it exactly right.
[02:13:07.717 --> 02:13:09.999]  We are being punished because we are effective.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:13.042]  We are being punished because we broadcast the truth.
[02:13:13.702 --> 02:13:20.427]  We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.
[02:13:20.888 --> 02:13:23.310]  And because we've been unabashed about saying it.
[02:13:24.331 --> 02:13:25.371]  There is no other reason.
[02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:28.683]  And I think Alex laid this out today.
[02:13:28.943 --> 02:13:36.727]  There's going to be violence in this country sometime in the near future against some reporter, or some media outlet, or somebody in the news business.
[02:13:37.128 --> 02:13:44.992]  And there's going to be a false attempt to blame it on us, saying we advocated it, or we proposed it, or we pushed it, or we financed it, or we arranged it.
[02:13:45.132 --> 02:13:46.873]  And those things are lies.
[02:13:47.334 --> 02:13:49.195]  We renounce violence.
[02:13:49.735 --> 02:13:51.816]  Violence would be counterproductive at this point.
[02:13:51.836 --> 02:13:54.358]  And the Republicans must not grovel and say, we're sorry.
[02:13:54.938 --> 02:13:57.839]  We throw the sacrificial lamb Alex Jones and Trump under the bus.
[02:13:58.199 --> 02:14:05.503]  Don't blame us when they're carrying the dead babies out, you know, like Oklahoma City that the Democrats, the Southern Poverty Law Center clearly was involved in, did.
[02:14:06.463 --> 02:14:08.264]  And we're not going to sit there and put up with that.
[02:14:08.344 --> 02:14:13.466]  Briefly, because we've done an hour and 15 minutes of broadcast here and I haven't plugged yet.
[02:14:14.881 --> 02:14:17.303]  If you don't financially support us, they're going to shut us down.
[02:14:17.464 --> 02:14:19.806]  Plus, we've got game-changing supplements and products.
[02:14:19.866 --> 02:14:21.007]  Everybody needs Brain Force.
[02:14:21.027 --> 02:14:22.709]  It's an incredible nootropic for the mind.
[02:14:23.710 --> 02:14:25.551]  DNA Force is amazing.
[02:14:26.292 --> 02:14:31.778]  At 50% off, there's nothing anywhere close to the price for PQQ, CoQ10, and this is a proprietary formula.
[02:14:32.718 --> 02:14:33.378]  We're good to go.
[02:14:52.043 --> 02:15:03.605]  Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Krill Oil, Knockout Sleep Aid, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste in 4-5 Chloral Silver and Iodine, Fluoride Free, The Real Red Pill Plus Now with Energy, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, or Triple 8.
[02:15:05.077 --> 02:15:05.838]  253-3139.
[02:15:05.898 --> 02:15:20.268]  So please, today, ladies and gentlemen, go to InfoWareStore.com and commit to get the ultimate turmeric formula, bodies, with all the great effects it has, to get Pollen Block, to get it all at InfoWareStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:15:20.308 --> 02:15:23.311]  And I want to thank you, the listeners, for your support.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.122]  I want to thank the crew because I get a little overheated and a little bit frustrated and angry at these points.
[02:15:28.162 --> 02:15:31.103]  Not with them, I'm just so chomping at the bit of how crazy this is.
[02:15:31.123 --> 02:15:37.846]  So I want to thank the crew as well and all of our AM and FM affiliates, TV affiliates that are all legally licensed and on the air and doing great.
[02:15:38.346 --> 02:15:44.709]  And all these fake stories now trying, because they've gone through our internet and banned us there, so now they're trying to go after our TV and radio stations.
[02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:44.969]  I mean...
[02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:56.065]  God Almighty, this is a strategic attack to get us off the air, ahead of the big false flag they're going to stage, to overthrow the election of Trump, the American awakening, the American recovery, and all of it.
[02:15:56.265 --> 02:15:57.467]  They're coming for your freedoms.
[02:15:57.567 --> 02:15:58.629]  America must rally.
[02:15:58.949 --> 02:15:59.630]  Now is the time.
[02:15:59.710 --> 02:16:01.273]  Infowars.com is the rallying point.
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:07.122]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:16:07.142 --> 02:16:07.643]  Thanks for holding.
[02:16:07.703 --> 02:16:08.623]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:16:08.783 --> 02:16:12.685]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:16:12.745 --> 02:16:21.490]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:37.818]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:16:38.298 --> 02:16:46.823]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:16:46.883 --> 02:16:51.645]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:16:51.786 --> 02:16:58.669]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side-by-side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[02:17:03.472 --> 02:17:04.993]  What are champions made of?

[02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:06.072]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:18:06.552 --> 02:18:15.399]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:18:15.999 --> 02:18:20.543]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:19:01.456 --> 02:19:02.036]  Look at that.
[02:19:02.056 --> 02:19:04.759]  Everybody else's is like yellow or clear.
[02:19:04.779 --> 02:19:06.240]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:07.000]  It's been watered down.
[02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:07.841]  We didn't do that.
[02:19:10.435 --> 02:19:13.896]  I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get.
[02:19:14.317 --> 02:19:15.957]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:19:16.538 --> 02:19:25.081]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[02:19:25.561 --> 02:19:27.242]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:19:27.302 --> 02:19:28.402]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:19:29.083 --> 02:19:31.604]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:19:31.644 --> 02:19:32.744]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[02:19:33.525 --> 02:19:36.446]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[02:19:43.999 --> 02:19:44.359]  Look it up!
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:51.485]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[02:19:51.525 --> 02:19:56.349]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[02:19:56.849 --> 02:20:00.031]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4Store.com.
[02:20:05.576 --> 02:20:08.178]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:23.971]  Alex Jones here, live.
[02:20:24.091 --> 02:20:25.332]  And look, I'm a little bit frantic.
[02:20:26.033 --> 02:20:27.414]  I'm a little bit wild.
[02:20:27.435 --> 02:20:28.375]  The crew's doing a great job.
[02:20:28.455 --> 02:20:29.096]  I seem angry.
[02:20:29.597 --> 02:20:30.117]  It's not them.
[02:20:30.317 --> 02:20:33.981]  I am literally seeing them run hoaxes against me.
[02:20:34.381 --> 02:20:39.346]  People that have worked here, who don't even politically totally agree with me, become like real
[02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:49.621]  The people that are converted to the Infowar because they're like, no, I know you hired me even though I'm kind of a liberal, but I'm not against free speech.
[02:20:49.681 --> 02:20:51.082]  And now I see this is crazy.
[02:20:51.583 --> 02:20:53.485]  You're not running pirate radio stations out of here.
[02:20:53.525 --> 02:20:55.827]  You're not wearing swastika shoes.
[02:20:55.847 --> 02:20:57.609]  You're not raping people in the hallways.
[02:20:58.890 --> 02:21:05.937]  And then now all these new lies and this push in 300 plus papers, Alex Jones is going to quote
[02:21:08.112 --> 02:21:09.533]  Order people to kill the media.
[02:21:10.194 --> 02:21:10.834]  No evidence.
[02:21:11.195 --> 02:21:12.356]  Trump is going to do it.
[02:21:13.096 --> 02:21:19.862]  And onlydrugreport.com is linked to our article about Lester Holt literally saying he's scared I'm coming to kill him.
[02:21:20.662 --> 02:21:22.003]  I mean, there's no such video.
[02:21:22.103 --> 02:21:22.664]  Antifa.
[02:21:24.205 --> 02:21:25.346]  Tucker Carlson aired it Monday.
[02:21:25.446 --> 02:21:26.227]  I covered it Sunday.
[02:21:27.588 --> 02:21:38.687]  They said we're going to kill Trump, we're going to kill his family, we're going to kill other members of Congress, and I said you better get your battle rifles ready if Antifa's doxxed you, whether you're ICE or federal law enforcement or anybody.
[02:21:39.368 --> 02:21:39.629]  Okay?
[02:21:40.905 --> 02:21:45.207]  And they literally don't ever show a quote, except Media Matters showed the video where I didn't say any of this.
[02:21:45.748 --> 02:21:50.831]  They all just show quotes out of context and now they're coming after everybody.
[02:21:51.351 --> 02:21:54.893]  Alex, there's historical precedent for your warning.
[02:21:55.333 --> 02:22:02.897]  Communist regimes, when they ran the Cultural Revolution in the late 1940s in China, they went door to door and they murdered people who were trying to speak out.
[02:22:02.917 --> 02:22:03.878]  They murdered academics.
[02:22:04.218 --> 02:22:06.740]  Who were trying to say, let's have a society based in reason.
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:09.663]  They were overrun and murdered by the communists.
[02:22:09.683 --> 02:22:11.164]  They turned children against their parents.
[02:22:11.544 --> 02:22:16.268]  They launched a snitch network where children literally turned in their parents to be murdered by communists.
[02:22:16.288 --> 02:22:18.470]  And the operating system down the college is his malice.
[02:22:18.490 --> 02:22:19.711]  I'm going to give you the floor of this segment.
[02:22:20.031 --> 02:22:22.193]  You came today to interview me for an emergency report.
[02:22:22.213 --> 02:22:24.675]  You can do that the next segment or next, but you've got the floor.
[02:22:24.735 --> 02:22:25.476]  You've been on fire.
[02:22:25.496 --> 02:22:26.477]  You're absolutely right.
[02:22:26.517 --> 02:22:27.057]  They blamed
[02:22:28.038 --> 02:22:29.118]  Oklahoma City on the page, Rich.
[02:22:29.158 --> 02:22:30.319]  There's about to be a political realignment.
[02:22:30.619 --> 02:22:32.860]  The same groups in shadow government power now.
[02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.440]  They're clearly planning the same thing.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:35.321]  Lay it out, Mike Adams.
[02:22:35.581 --> 02:22:46.525]  Well, one of the reasons that I'm here today is because it's extraordinary that the entire corporate media complex is now willing to commit journalistic suicide in order to try to destroy you, Alex.
[02:22:46.865 --> 02:22:48.806]  That they are now so over the top.
[02:22:49.386 --> 02:22:51.108]  Fabricating fake quotes.
[02:22:51.128 --> 02:22:53.270]  You know, they're playing word salad games, right?
[02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:56.754]  Where they cherry-pick words that you said in a long video.
[02:22:56.794 --> 02:23:06.584]  They can pick a word from two minutes, and a word from six minutes, and a word from 12 minutes, and then they recombine those to falsely claim that you said something that you did not say.
[02:23:07.225 --> 02:23:10.246]  And by the way, my team's working on a video right now of Lester Holt.
[02:23:10.607 --> 02:23:12.247]  We're going to do a satire response.
[02:23:12.267 --> 02:23:21.772]  We're going to have Lester Holt playing word games with himself to see what Lester Holt says that is hilarious just by cutting and pasting all his words together.
[02:23:22.072 --> 02:23:23.613]  So we're going to do that just as a demonstration.
[02:23:23.633 --> 02:23:24.773]  We're not going to claim it's real news.
[02:23:24.813 --> 02:23:25.814]  We're going to claim it's satire.
[02:23:26.194 --> 02:23:31.757]  But this is an urgent moment because the media is willing to do anything to destroy you.
[02:23:31.917 --> 02:23:34.398]  Even they're willing to commit suicide of their own credibility.
[02:23:34.438 --> 02:23:35.098]  Look at CNN.
[02:23:35.118 --> 02:23:35.779]  They said yesterday
[02:23:36.739 --> 02:23:40.561]  I'm complicit in domestic terror, and am a terrorist who should be arrested.
[02:23:41.601 --> 02:23:42.902]  Well, it's now clear.
[02:23:43.382 --> 02:23:44.343]  I even texted you this.
[02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:47.404]  I am 100% certain that they are going to run.
[02:23:47.424 --> 02:23:55.588]  I was at dinner with my wife and Roger Stone and some crew, and I said, they're setting me up for a new Oklahoma City, and you literally texted me while I was saying it.
[02:23:55.648 --> 02:23:55.928]  Really?
[02:23:56.248 --> 02:23:56.509]  Really?
[02:23:56.529 --> 02:24:03.032]  I am 100% certain that they are going to stage an event, real violence,
[02:24:04.051 --> 02:24:12.979]  Real shootings, and I think they're going to try to set up something where they shoot their own people at CNN or a tech giant, and they're going to blame you.
[02:24:12.999 --> 02:24:14.280]  And they're going to call for your arrest.
[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:20.125]  Well, you see Skelter and all of them saying, blood on your hands, New York Times, it's coming, Trump's going to kill us, and this is what Clinton did in 95.
[02:24:21.522 --> 02:24:28.244]  And it's extraordinary because these are the same media organizations that, number one, advocate the mass killing of unborn babies.
[02:24:28.484 --> 02:24:29.364]  Let's just start there.
[02:24:29.744 --> 02:24:35.866]  They've advocated the fake premise behind many of the international wars under President Bush.
[02:24:36.706 --> 02:24:38.027]  You know, you've talked about that as well.
[02:24:38.047 --> 02:24:46.009]  These are the same media organizations... And they wouldn't be silencing me and making this reckless action unless they knew that something big was coming that would legitimize it.
[02:24:46.371 --> 02:24:48.975]  And it's clear they've been ordered to attack you at all costs.
[02:24:49.475 --> 02:24:54.803]  They've been ordered to do anything, even to commit their own suicide as a credible news organization.
[02:24:55.163 --> 02:25:02.433]  I mean, Lester Holt, he should not only apologize to you on the air, he should resign or be forced out of NBC News.
[02:25:03.234 --> 02:25:07.836]  Seems worse than Ross, who had to resign from ABC, saying that Flynn admitted he was a Russian agent.
[02:25:07.876 --> 02:25:08.036]  Right.
[02:25:08.396 --> 02:25:08.576]  Right.
[02:25:08.776 --> 02:25:09.156]  Exactly.
[02:25:09.196 --> 02:25:11.697]  I mean, this is deliberately fake news.
[02:25:11.957 --> 02:25:12.758]  It's not an accident.
[02:25:13.178 --> 02:25:16.859]  And by the way, as you are well aware, you could win a defamation case against Russ.
[02:25:16.879 --> 02:25:18.400]  Oh, the lawyers are all freaked out right now.
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:19.640]  They go, no, these are open and shut.
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:20.720]  And they're all scared.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:21.821]  They go, no, we agree now.
[02:25:22.321 --> 02:25:23.622]  They're planning a total takeover.
[02:25:23.902 --> 02:25:24.302]  They wouldn't.
[02:25:24.342 --> 02:25:25.062]  That's the thing, Mike.
[02:25:25.782 --> 02:25:26.243]  This is it.
[02:25:26.363 --> 02:25:27.263]  This is the final result.
[02:25:27.603 --> 02:25:27.963]  I get it.
[02:25:28.204 --> 02:25:39.894]  And even coming here today, I'm asking myself, driving here on the road, is this the day that by the time I show up at InfoWars, there is some massive attack taking place somewhere?
[02:25:39.934 --> 02:25:43.637]  I was going to leave, and I'm going to walk out for a couple of seconds, so I won't keep interrupting, or you want to interview me?
[02:25:43.657 --> 02:25:44.158]  No, it's okay.
[02:25:44.298 --> 02:25:48.381]  This morning, I was about to leave at about 9 o'clock, and I went and held my wife and the baby on the couch, and I said,
[02:25:49.639 --> 02:25:50.100]  We're winners.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:51.020]  We're doing this for the country.
[02:25:51.141 --> 02:25:51.821]  We're in the right.
[02:25:51.841 --> 02:25:53.483]  We're going to have to make sacrifices.
[02:25:53.763 --> 02:25:55.645]  And my wife said, she said, are you scared?
[02:25:55.665 --> 02:25:58.428]  And I said, this could be the last show any day now.
[02:25:58.508 --> 02:26:00.050]  This is it.
[02:26:00.170 --> 02:26:01.311]  I mean, this is real.
[02:26:02.032 --> 02:26:08.158]  You know, you and I have covered news and events and analysis for enough years to know the pattern.
[02:26:08.578 --> 02:26:09.599]  This has been done before.
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:10.941]  It is a blueprint.
[02:26:10.961 --> 02:26:12.382]  Only when they invade a major country.
[02:26:13.945 --> 02:26:18.627]  But, I mean, never forget, they've tried to run operations before to take out other people.
[02:26:19.067 --> 02:26:21.008]  This could fizzle if people take action.
[02:26:21.108 --> 02:26:22.329]  But if folks don't, it's over.
[02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:24.570]  They're going to blow stuff up, shoot people and blame us.
[02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.631]  Let me ask you this.
[02:26:26.684 --> 02:26:31.166]  Do you think they're going to hit a major tech or are they going to hit like the New York Times or CNN?
[02:26:31.426 --> 02:26:34.908]  Because they keep saying we're victims, Alex wants to kill us, Trump wants to kill us.
[02:26:34.968 --> 02:26:36.028]  It's so clear what they're doing.
[02:26:36.788 --> 02:26:37.509]  Who do you think they hit?
[02:26:37.769 --> 02:26:43.071]  Number one target that they want to show is attacks on journalists.
[02:26:43.731 --> 02:26:44.252]  That's number one.
[02:26:45.572 --> 02:26:46.873]  Make them the untouchable victims?
[02:26:46.913 --> 02:26:48.593]  Make them the victims, exactly.
[02:26:48.694 --> 02:27:00.238]  Blame you, use it to shut down all conservatives, and attack anyone who has been associated with you, including myself, Roger Stone, and the President, and then use this as an issue to try to defeat the President in 2020.
[02:27:00.998 --> 02:27:06.561]  By saying, look, the President advocated for a terrorist who was involved in the shooting.
[02:27:06.621 --> 02:27:10.502]  And the Alex Jones supporter detonated a truck bomb outside the New York Times.
[02:27:10.582 --> 02:27:11.863]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:27:12.263 --> 02:27:14.464]  And all they have to do... Hundreds were killed in the aftermath.
[02:27:15.498 --> 02:27:17.980]  They can very easily put together a scapegoat.
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:19.821]  You know, they can do a Manchurian candidate.
[02:27:19.901 --> 02:27:25.384]  They can do, like, an Aurora, Colorado Batman guy, you know, on crazy psych drugs, hypnotized.
[02:27:25.424 --> 02:27:28.566]  They can have, you know, all kinds of scenarios.
[02:27:28.586 --> 02:27:31.928]  They're surefires have a mental patient drug demo of something like Halcyon.
[02:27:32.148 --> 02:27:32.388]  Exactly.
[02:27:32.408 --> 02:27:35.030]  Do they go kill everybody, or do they put the person in a SWAT outfit and blame them?
[02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:35.870]  Exactly.
[02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:37.531]  That person never does the shooting.
[02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:41.493]  It's another team that does the shooting, and then they're out of there, and then that person gets the blame.
[02:27:41.533 --> 02:27:42.694]  I mean, we've seen this before.
[02:27:42.714 --> 02:27:53.379]  And then that person, they will have on that person's browser, oh, InfoWars, InfoWars, your episodes, maybe your products on their kitchen table.
[02:27:53.419 --> 02:27:57.061]  I mean, anything to frame you, and they will report it as a fact.
[02:27:57.341 --> 02:27:58.623]  By the way, we'll call for your arrest.
[02:27:58.663 --> 02:27:59.744]  This isn't a simulation.
[02:27:59.764 --> 02:28:00.145]  This is real.
[02:28:00.165 --> 02:28:03.489]  When we come back, lay out how you think we can counter this because I'm going to say this again.
[02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.911]  I'm not worried about me.
[02:28:05.472 --> 02:28:07.014]  I'm worried about them winning.
[02:28:07.574 --> 02:28:08.676]  They know we woke up.
[02:28:08.736 --> 02:28:09.757]  They underestimated us.
[02:28:09.797 --> 02:28:10.658]  They're making their move.
[02:28:11.119 --> 02:28:12.140]  Trump needs to take action.
[02:28:14.022 --> 02:28:14.502]  You can see it.
[02:28:14.522 --> 02:28:16.003]  I mean, a thousand percent.
[02:28:16.043 --> 02:28:21.507]  How do they think they don't hype that we're going to physically attack them and lie about it, and that we don't know it's their final card?
[02:28:21.607 --> 02:28:22.568]  It's evident.
[02:28:22.708 --> 02:28:24.509]  It's so obvious at this point.
[02:28:24.849 --> 02:28:26.830]  There is no denying that they're running this play.
[02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.451]  Same play.
[02:28:27.491 --> 02:28:29.252]  It's a playbook they've had for generations.
[02:28:29.572 --> 02:28:30.413]  They're running the same thing.
[02:28:30.453 --> 02:28:31.393]  It's like a Hail Mary.
[02:28:31.633 --> 02:28:31.894]  It is.
[02:28:32.454 --> 02:28:33.414]  Because they know you're winning.
[02:28:33.475 --> 02:28:35.116]  They know we're winning in the realm of ideas.
[02:28:35.176 --> 02:28:38.938]  Like Roger said, we will win if we are allowed to speak.
[02:28:39.378 --> 02:28:40.299]  That's what this is all about.
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:42.180]  Very simple.
[02:28:43.871 --> 02:28:45.352]  I want to tell Bill Clinton and Hillary something.
[02:28:45.372 --> 02:28:49.554]  This worked when you bombed Oklahoma City 20 years ago, 20-something years ago.
[02:28:49.594 --> 02:28:50.575]  It ain't going to work this time.
[02:28:51.135 --> 02:28:54.877]  Mike Adams, straight ahead, he wants to interview me for a piece he wants to put out.
[02:28:54.897 --> 02:28:56.318]  So we'll do that either this segment or the next.
[02:28:56.378 --> 02:29:00.000]  And then he's going to host with Roger Stone in the fourth hour.
[02:29:00.902 --> 02:29:07.325]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:29:07.385 --> 02:29:14.189]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:29:14.209 --> 02:29:29.757]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:34.542]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:29:35.262 --> 02:29:35.983]  He's a punk.
[02:29:36.964 --> 02:29:37.724]  He's a dog.
[02:29:38.545 --> 02:29:39.205]  He's a pig.
[02:29:39.385 --> 02:29:40.926]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[02:29:41.106 --> 02:29:43.568]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:48.191]  Here's my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, d*** sucker.
[02:29:48.231 --> 02:29:49.651]  The President of the United States
[02:29:50.592 --> 02:29:54.075]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[02:29:54.175 --> 02:29:59.780]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:03.503]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[02:30:05.405 --> 02:30:06.546]  This is CNN.
[02:30:11.374 --> 02:30:14.437]  Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.
[02:30:34.707 --> 02:30:35.167]  Have you heard?
[02:30:35.648 --> 02:30:37.710]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:30:37.810 --> 02:30:39.091]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:30:39.271 --> 02:30:40.312]  They're all censoring us.
[02:30:40.693 --> 02:30:46.579]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:30:46.899 --> 02:30:49.902]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:31:00.836 --> 02:31:05.099]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:20.712]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[02:31:21.512 --> 02:31:25.573]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[02:31:26.334 --> 02:31:41.439]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[02:31:42.379 --> 02:31:52.728]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[02:31:53.628 --> 02:31:55.270]  We cannot do it alone.
[02:31:56.150 --> 02:32:03.556]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[02:32:04.037 --> 02:32:08.601]  Go to the donation portion of the site and send us
[02:32:09.501 --> 02:32:13.523]  $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[02:32:14.764 --> 02:32:20.026]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[02:32:20.867 --> 02:32:21.247]  Why?
[02:32:21.387 --> 02:32:27.030]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[02:32:28.090 --> 02:32:42.695]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[02:32:43.175 --> 02:32:45.576]  The entire question is up to you.
[02:32:46.236 --> 02:32:47.417]  We need your support.
[02:32:48.037 --> 02:32:51.338]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[02:32:51.778 --> 02:32:53.319]  We are not crying wolf.
[02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:59.617]  Please go to the InfoWars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[02:33:04.965 --> 02:33:07.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.377 --> 02:33:33.623]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.923 --> 02:33:43.868]  You know, I'm not nervous about me or my family, because I know we're going to lose the whole country and the world if we don't beat this, but I am so upset that it's on our shoulders.
[02:33:43.948 --> 02:33:46.990]  Mike Adams, myself, you, the listeners and viewers, they are 100%
[02:33:49.171 --> 02:33:54.453]  Laying the groundwork with a huge PR rollout that Trump and I and others are calling for violence, but none of us are.
[02:33:55.093 --> 02:33:57.955]  And that imminent terror attacks are coming and we've all got to be arrested.
[02:33:58.015 --> 02:33:59.515]  All free speech has got to be taken.
[02:33:59.955 --> 02:34:04.997]  Senator Warner, Senator Murphy have introduced plans to ban all conservative speech in talk radio.
[02:34:06.098 --> 02:34:11.440]  They're announcing that federal agents raided our offices for illegal broadcasting and shut us down today.
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:12.520]  No one was raided.
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:15.381]  It didn't even happen to some micro pirate.
[02:34:15.661 --> 02:34:16.142]  It's all a hoax.
[02:34:17.904 --> 02:34:20.467]  Ahead of the election, this is not going to be like any other U.S.
[02:34:20.507 --> 02:34:20.908]  election.
[02:34:20.988 --> 02:34:22.790]  This is the most critical in our history.
[02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:24.772]  This is 1776 Part 2.
[02:34:24.812 --> 02:34:25.914]  Now, Mike Adams had an idea.
[02:34:26.254 --> 02:34:27.155]  He called me last night.
[02:34:27.175 --> 02:34:29.538]  We were on the same page saying, Claire, the false flag's coming.
[02:34:29.578 --> 02:34:32.662]  He said, somebody needs to interview you to get this on record.
[02:34:33.022 --> 02:34:37.067]  But then, Part 2 of that is, we're going to post it to Infowars.com with the great crew.
[02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:44.335]  The splash page, you've got to get this interview out because they banned us everywhere, including Twitter, so we can't respond to their lies.
[02:34:44.595 --> 02:34:48.460]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, engineer, health ranger, best-selling author.
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:49.361]  Please continue.
[02:34:50.014 --> 02:34:52.315]  Alright Alex, you're correct.
[02:34:52.995 --> 02:35:08.703]  I think that we need to ask you, somebody independent of your organization like myself needs to ask you some very upfront and tough questions that maybe a corporate media journalist would try to ask you, but of course we can't trust them because they would mix and match your words and edit it, so let's just do it live right here.
[02:35:09.263 --> 02:35:10.784]  Let me establish something right up front.
[02:35:11.464 --> 02:35:15.866]  Do I have any financial ties with you or InfoWars or have I ever had any financial ties?
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:17.240]  Okay.
[02:35:18.461 --> 02:35:20.283]  And I affirm that as well.
[02:35:20.343 --> 02:35:24.246]  I've always been, you know, volunteer here because of what we're fighting for.
[02:35:25.247 --> 02:35:25.827]  Next question.
[02:35:26.528 --> 02:35:31.312]  Do you advocate any use of violence to silence journalists who are attacking you?
[02:35:31.572 --> 02:35:34.374]  For example, do you think that Lester Holt should be shot and killed?
[02:35:35.155 --> 02:35:35.835]  Absolutely not.
[02:35:35.975 --> 02:35:41.019]  A, it's against what I believe in as a libertarian and as a constitutionalist, as a renaissance person.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.300]  I'm winning politically against him.
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:45.201]  The last thing I want is for him to be hurt.
[02:35:45.921 --> 02:35:47.241]  Because that turns him into a martyr.
[02:35:47.281 --> 02:35:49.642]  So I pray every night that he lives to be 110 years old.
[02:35:49.682 --> 02:35:55.143]  But do you advocate others to carry out such violence inspired by your broadcast?
[02:35:55.163 --> 02:35:59.023]  Are you trying to get others to do the same?
[02:35:59.043 --> 02:35:59.784]  100% no.
[02:36:01.484 --> 02:36:02.784]  That would make them the victim.
[02:36:03.264 --> 02:36:06.665]  I want to politically, legally, and lawfully challenge them.
[02:36:08.283 --> 02:36:17.516]  Are you funding in any way some group that wants to commit violence against journalists?
[02:36:17.536 --> 02:36:18.478]  A. No.
[02:36:18.758 --> 02:36:19.800]  B. Hell no.
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:22.443]  C. On my soul and my children, no.
[02:36:23.866 --> 02:36:25.287]  A. We wouldn't win politically that way.
[02:36:25.467 --> 02:36:26.568]  B. We would lose.
[02:36:26.588 --> 02:36:28.029]  C. I don't want to be in a Supermax prison.
[02:36:28.170 --> 02:36:28.690]  No, no, no.
[02:36:28.970 --> 02:36:29.491]  Right, right.
[02:36:30.511 --> 02:36:33.174]  Have you ever violently assaulted children?
[02:36:33.454 --> 02:36:35.475]  Your own or anybody else's children?
[02:36:35.615 --> 02:36:36.636]  Because they're claiming you did.
[02:36:36.656 --> 02:36:39.138]  No, I actually don't even spank my children and probably spoiled them.
[02:36:39.879 --> 02:36:40.199]  Okay.
[02:36:40.860 --> 02:36:48.426]  I've never assaulted anybody offensively and I haven't been in a fight other than communists attacking me and I defended myself in decades.
[02:36:50.302 --> 02:36:53.904]  Do you... Alright, here's a psychological question, you might say.
[02:36:53.924 --> 02:36:58.807]  I think that leftists are terrified of your delivery style.
[02:37:00.228 --> 02:37:06.051]  The words that you say, if they were uttered by someone like Barack Obama, many of the things you say would be acceptable.
[02:37:06.572 --> 02:37:10.174]  It's in some way your style, your aggressive energy.
[02:37:11.114 --> 02:37:16.518]  Do you recognize that leftists may be terrified of your style, if not your words?
[02:37:16.778 --> 02:37:18.439]  I think they're afraid of the confidence.
[02:37:19.346 --> 02:37:19.486]  Okay.
[02:37:19.506 --> 02:37:24.869]  Because if you look at them, it's all about being very oily and very subdued and very no, no, no.
[02:37:25.209 --> 02:37:25.649]  Heartbeat.
[02:37:25.749 --> 02:37:25.929]  Right.
[02:37:26.029 --> 02:37:27.230]  Academic speech.
[02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.310]  Um.
[02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.831]  Kind of NPR.
[02:37:31.592 --> 02:37:34.914]  I think, this is my opinion, I think they want to destroy you because they're terrified of you.
[02:37:35.415 --> 02:37:37.696]  What would you do if you had absolute power?
[02:37:38.097 --> 02:37:40.839]  I mean, if you ran the country, what would you do with that power?
[02:37:41.339 --> 02:37:44.481]  I'm like Ron Paul said, if he got elected president, it would take a long time to fix things.
[02:37:44.501 --> 02:37:45.262]  He's not a dictator.
[02:37:45.302 --> 02:37:56.951]  I would use the Constitution and public persuasion and popularity and prosperity to try to show people that free market, true open society is better than corporate crony capitalism, socialism, or communism.
[02:37:56.971 --> 02:37:59.113]  So I would never run the country
[02:37:59.693 --> 02:38:01.214]  Because that's not what a president does.
[02:38:02.355 --> 02:38:02.995]  Right, right.
[02:38:03.055 --> 02:38:04.296]  So I cannot run the country.
[02:38:05.917 --> 02:38:08.098]  Now you've given me permission to ask some tough questions here.
[02:38:08.878 --> 02:38:16.863]  Are there circumstances under which you would call for Americans to stand up and defend their country using constitutionally protected means?
[02:38:16.903 --> 02:38:19.084]  I mean, what's the trigger point if we're under assault?
[02:38:19.104 --> 02:38:19.704]  That's my line of the sand?
[02:38:19.925 --> 02:38:20.745]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:20.845 --> 02:38:24.968]  As I said, we played videos the other night, the Twitter band, of Antifa.
[02:38:26.048 --> 02:38:31.734]  Dozens of them saying, we're going to kill Republicans, we're going to kill Trump and his family, we're going to kill Congress people and talk show hosts.
[02:38:32.275 --> 02:38:33.236]  And here's where they live.
[02:38:33.856 --> 02:38:37.140]  And I said, folks better get their battle rifles ready if they attack you to protect.
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:37.600]  Right.
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.722]  Then that turned into, I'm going to attack the press.
[02:38:39.742 --> 02:38:41.244]  There's no quote, there's no video.
[02:38:41.604 --> 02:38:44.808]  They just say, Jones said, get battle rifles ready for the chi-coms.
[02:38:44.828 --> 02:38:45.769]  It wasn't even part of the discussion.
[02:38:46.943 --> 02:38:59.797]  So if you're being offensively attacked, if they're arresting conservatives all over the place, if they're taking people off the air, and if they're announcing that Republican members of Congress got killed or their plane blew up or Trump's been assassinated...
[02:39:01.983 --> 02:39:09.807]  I mean, I think at that point, people need to know who the globalists are in their area, and they need to make their own decision between them and God what they're going to do.
[02:39:09.827 --> 02:39:20.953]  I'm trying to fix things peacefully, but if they offensively attack us in a night of the long knives like Hitler, or a Kristallnacht, or some type of Soviet-style purge, I think it's up to every man and woman to be ready for what they're going to do.
[02:39:20.973 --> 02:39:23.614]  They have their own action plan, because we're not a centralized system.
[02:39:23.775 --> 02:39:25.155]  You're describing a defensive posture.
[02:39:25.175 --> 02:39:26.316]  Let's talk about French resistance here.
[02:39:26.716 --> 02:39:29.437]  Okay, a defensive posture is what it sounds like to me.
[02:39:29.937 --> 02:39:35.278]  But I think that many people on the left believe that you don't even have the right to shoot someone who invades your home.
[02:39:35.598 --> 02:39:36.458]  I mean, they've said things like that.
[02:39:36.479 --> 02:39:40.600]  Well, in England and everywhere else, the number one crime is if you're being looted or mugged or raped, fighting back.
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:42.980]  Because that's their constituency.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.441]  Like they said, MS-13 are God's children.
[02:39:45.461 --> 02:39:47.201]  They should be able to torture eight-year-old girls to death.
[02:39:49.042 --> 02:39:49.442]  Would you?
[02:39:50.615 --> 02:39:53.417]  Would you ever be willing to... Let me explain this.
[02:39:53.698 --> 02:39:53.878]  Yeah.
[02:39:54.158 --> 02:39:56.580]  Mike, I feel like we've lost if we get to the shooting war.
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:57.381]  Yes.
[02:39:57.581 --> 02:39:59.783]  So, I never even deal with the shooting war.
[02:39:59.803 --> 02:40:01.024]  I fight as hard as I can.
[02:40:01.344 --> 02:40:02.465]  They want the shooting war.
[02:40:02.485 --> 02:40:03.426]  They want the censorship.
[02:40:03.686 --> 02:40:07.869]  They want to say we started the shooting war because they're losing the intellectual war.
[02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:17.117]  So, I am literally, strategically, intellectually, culturally, spiritually, mathematically, financially,
[02:40:19.450 --> 02:40:30.821]  Topography-wise, geospatial-wise, against a civil war with a bunch of dumb bots, I want to defeat the establishment's cultural elite that are eugenicists.
[02:40:31.382 --> 02:40:36.947]  But if, let's say there were a false flag attack carried out against journalists such as Lester Holt, who's attacked you,
[02:40:37.833 --> 02:40:38.394]  Would you celebrate?
[02:40:38.414 --> 02:40:38.975]  Who said it's coming?
[02:40:39.195 --> 02:40:40.216]  Would you celebrate such an attack?
[02:40:40.236 --> 02:40:47.106]  Oh my God, I would be on the air instantly on any forum I could saying, investigate this, I stand against this, this is horrible.
[02:40:47.166 --> 02:40:49.650]  The last thing we want is violence offensively.
[02:40:49.730 --> 02:40:50.872]  I decry it and I say no.
[02:40:53.641 --> 02:41:02.966]  Would you use the Infowars organization to in any way engage in acts of lawlessness or sedition against America?
[02:41:03.546 --> 02:41:06.088]  That would be turning my back on everything we've done for 24 years.
[02:41:06.228 --> 02:41:07.068]  I would never do that.
[02:41:07.148 --> 02:41:07.329]  Right.
[02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:08.669]  It's the left pushing all that.
[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:12.331]  It's Cuomo's, you know, the governor saying America was never good.
[02:41:12.351 --> 02:41:14.452]  America was never that important.
[02:41:14.472 --> 02:41:15.313]  America was never great.
[02:41:15.353 --> 02:41:16.233]  America's not that great.
[02:41:16.534 --> 02:41:18.234]  It's them covering up for Antifa.
[02:41:18.275 --> 02:41:18.915]  It's them doing this.
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:22.122]  Well, look, those are the questions that I can think of, Alex.
[02:41:22.162 --> 02:41:23.523]  I appreciate you letting me ask these.
[02:41:23.803 --> 02:41:26.985]  It's just that they will consistently lie about you.
[02:41:27.626 --> 02:41:29.808]  They will twist your words and distort your words.
[02:41:29.948 --> 02:41:31.449]  And they will try to demonize you.
[02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:33.991]  And they're having a lot of success and traction in that.
[02:41:34.311 --> 02:41:38.995]  But if they're willing to abandon all these standards of journalism, that means that they can report.
[02:41:39.535 --> 02:41:45.700]  After such an attack takes place, a false flag attack, they can literally go out and report, Alex Jones called for this attack.
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.902]  That is why we know it's about to happen.
[02:41:48.502 --> 02:41:50.382]  They're going to lose the election unless they do this.
[02:41:50.902 --> 02:41:57.824]  And I criticize the Chi-Com takeover, and that was a big part of it, but they say, are pointing out that Stelter says, we're about to be attacked.
[02:41:57.864 --> 02:41:58.364]  It's imminent.
[02:41:58.464 --> 02:41:59.344]  Blood on Trump's hands.
[02:41:59.684 --> 02:42:01.685]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, every channel.
[02:42:02.065 --> 02:42:03.365]  I said, looks like a false flag.
[02:42:03.425 --> 02:42:04.245]  No one's threatening them.
[02:42:04.545 --> 02:42:05.685]  They're the ones calling for violence.
[02:42:05.745 --> 02:42:06.566]  Trump isn't threatening them.
[02:42:06.806 --> 02:42:09.026]  He's fighting back, calling them liars when they attack him.
[02:42:09.506 --> 02:42:10.907]  That's why they don't want me on air.
[02:42:11.187 --> 02:42:17.608]  That's why they've been saying, oh, don't say school shootings are staged, or don't question anything and misrepresent what I said, because they don't want us on air.
[02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:20.529]  How do you expose somebody that's exposed to false flags?
[02:42:20.869 --> 02:42:22.390]  How do you expose somebody that says, look at the vans?
[02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:23.591]  You claim they're behind them.
[02:42:23.951 --> 02:42:25.191]  That's their ultimate cover.
[02:42:25.492 --> 02:42:31.074]  You silence us, and the folks that expose, sometimes they stage things, you blame those that expose it as the culprit.
[02:42:31.134 --> 02:42:32.255]  All right, but last question, Alex.
[02:42:32.595 --> 02:42:33.735]  What is your endgame?
[02:42:33.996 --> 02:42:35.276]  What is your purpose?
[02:42:35.716 --> 02:42:36.537]  Why are you doing this?
[02:42:37.117 --> 02:42:40.779]  You know, that's a big question, and we'll answer that when we come back, because I can't do it in 20 seconds.
[02:42:41.039 --> 02:42:43.900]  Mike Adams is here, naturalnews.com, the Health Ranger.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:46.222]  I'm with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:42:47.462 --> 02:42:48.523]  I'm with Jesus right now.
[02:42:48.543 --> 02:42:49.263]  I feel good.
[02:42:49.283 --> 02:42:50.224]  I'm going on to the end.
[02:42:50.244 --> 02:42:55.647]  I'm just really worried about the country and all of you out there, because if you don't take action and spread this, they're gonna win.
[02:42:55.707 --> 02:42:56.788]  False flags are imminent.
[02:42:56.808 --> 02:42:58.489]  It could happen in hours, days, or weeks.
[02:42:58.529 --> 02:42:58.889]  Get ready.
[02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:06.071]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:06.131 --> 02:43:07.572]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:43:07.632 --> 02:43:07.992]  Go ahead.
[02:43:08.092 --> 02:43:08.353]  Yes.
[02:43:08.813 --> 02:43:09.533]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:09.633 --> 02:43:15.838]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:16.058 --> 02:43:20.041]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:20.261 --> 02:43:21.722]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:22.082 --> 02:43:28.787]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:43:28.867 --> 02:43:31.869]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:32.609 --> 02:43:37.291]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:37.331 --> 02:43:45.155]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:43:45.175 --> 02:43:51.017]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:51.117 --> 02:43:56.440]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:59.541]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:44:01.562 --> 02:44:05.224]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[02:44:05.525 --> 02:44:08.947]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[02:44:09.307 --> 02:44:18.833]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[02:44:19.353 --> 02:44:22.775]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[02:44:23.135 --> 02:44:28.078]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:44:28.138 --> 02:44:30.500]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:35.463]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[02:44:35.483 --> 02:44:36.023]  Ah, you don't want that.
[02:44:36.443 --> 02:44:36.543]  Ow!
[02:44:36.563 --> 02:44:37.864]  I think you're a goldfish!
[02:45:06.858 --> 02:45:08.918]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:45:09.198 --> 02:45:10.279]  I believe in you!
[02:45:10.719 --> 02:45:11.819]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:45:13.579 --> 02:45:16.480]  One man ever wrecks a woman!
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.400]  All genitals are cut off!
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:21.100]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:22.461]  And we're not backing down ever!
[02:45:23.721 --> 02:45:25.521]  I wanna get these people!
[02:45:25.561 --> 02:45:26.061]  We're winning!
[02:45:26.121 --> 02:45:27.221]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:45:27.382 --> 02:45:27.842]  Can't you?
[02:45:28.142 --> 02:45:29.762]  We have broken their back!
[02:45:30.122 --> 02:45:31.302]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:45:35.143 --> 02:45:35.663]  Let's go!
[02:45:37.085 --> 02:45:37.485]  Come on!
[02:45:37.505 --> 02:45:37.846]  Come on!

[02:45:52.237 --> 02:45:52.417]  Come on!

[02:45:53.918 --> 02:45:54.258]  Come on!
[02:45:54.278 --> 02:45:54.558]  Come on!

[02:45:55.159 --> 02:45:55.379]  Come on!
[02:45:55.399 --> 02:45:55.659]  Come on!
[02:45:55.699 --> 02:45:55.900]  Come on!
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:56.180]  Come on!
[02:45:56.280 --> 02:45:56.480]  Come on!
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:56.680]  Come on!
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:56.920]  Come on!

[02:45:57.241 --> 02:45:57.381]  Come on!
[02:45:57.401 --> 02:45:57.561]  Come on!
[02:45:57.581 --> 02:45:57.741]  Come on
[02:46:01.497 --> 02:46:06.764]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:46:07.485 --> 02:46:10.789]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:17.217]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:26.001]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:46:26.821 --> 02:46:32.062]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:46:32.683 --> 02:46:44.805]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:46:45.245 --> 02:46:47.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:39.390 --> 02:47:42.352]  I cannot stress the importance of this broadcast.
[02:47:43.072 --> 02:47:45.274]  In my whole life, I could never imagine we'd be at this point.
[02:47:45.334 --> 02:47:45.734]  They are 100%
[02:47:47.828 --> 02:47:53.658]  Admitting they're preparing false flags that Trump and myself and others have called for violence to then ban us.
[02:47:54.039 --> 02:47:56.884]  Democrat top senators are saying they're going to ban all conservatives.
[02:47:57.285 --> 02:47:58.126]  Fairness doctrine.
[02:47:58.247 --> 02:47:58.968]  Talk radio.
[02:47:59.128 --> 02:47:59.909]  It's all here.
[02:48:01.189 --> 02:48:07.553]  But, the fact that we've gone to number one on the apps, the fact that people are flooding to Infowars.com, that's panicked them.
[02:48:07.633 --> 02:48:15.959]  So now, they're trying to put a narrative that we're going to be raided by the Feds, that our broadcast itself is illegal, aka the First Amendment.
[02:48:16.079 --> 02:48:26.026]  Total fraud over some half a watt thing a year ago that I never even knew about, that some other people had that was in the news, and now it's back in the news that the Feds shut down my flagship.
[02:48:27.068 --> 02:48:27.828]  I'm going off air.
[02:48:28.269 --> 02:48:32.211]  It's really pathetic of the Democrats if we're aware of it and act against it.
[02:48:32.251 --> 02:48:33.992]  But President Trump needs to take action.
[02:48:34.492 --> 02:48:35.412]  And you need to take action.
[02:48:35.432 --> 02:48:38.254]  We'll talk about how we think you should do that coming up.
[02:48:39.394 --> 02:48:40.175]  We're in the war room today.
[02:48:40.195 --> 02:48:41.175]  I think I'm going to stick around.
[02:48:41.235 --> 02:48:44.817]  I was going to go out and do some business stuff with Roger and develop some stuff.
[02:48:44.837 --> 02:48:48.119]  I think we're going to stay here and host there and take calls about wargaming all this.
[02:48:48.299 --> 02:48:48.859]  3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:48.899 --> 02:48:50.880]  at Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:51.901]  Really smart guys here.
[02:48:53.035 --> 02:48:58.117]  He's been concerned about the very, very same things, but you were asking me a question, the last question of the interview.
[02:48:58.137 --> 02:48:58.517]  What was it?
[02:48:59.137 --> 02:48:59.817]  What's my endgame?
[02:48:59.977 --> 02:49:01.337]  Yeah, what's your endgame?
[02:49:01.377 --> 02:49:06.379]  I mean, you're suffering a tremendous amount of fake news attacks, a tremendous burden.
[02:49:07.219 --> 02:49:10.220]  The pain and suffering that they're putting you through, personally, is extraordinary.
[02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:13.881]  What makes it worth it?
[02:49:14.041 --> 02:49:16.102]  Why are you running InfoWars?
[02:49:16.142 --> 02:49:16.942]  What is your endgame?
[02:49:19.103 --> 02:49:19.863]  Nothing gets free.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:27.082]  I mean, we stand on the shoulders of men and women that fought and died in all these wars, the Revolutionary War.
[02:49:27.482 --> 02:49:35.085]  When the Founding Fathers, many of their families would get kidnapped, because they'd have to stay back at the house, and they'd take and put them on slave ships and prison ships until they starved to death.
[02:49:35.105 --> 02:49:39.047]  They'd write them letters and say, your wife weighs about 85 pounds now, she's got a cough.
[02:49:39.607 --> 02:49:41.828]  And the Founders had to let their wives and children die.
[02:49:41.848 --> 02:49:44.009]  And it wasn't because they didn't care about their wives and children.
[02:49:44.649 --> 02:49:46.830]  It was that they wanted to beat that tyranny.
[02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:49.451]  And so they're not starving my wife and kids to death yet.
[02:49:50.373 --> 02:49:56.256]  And, you know, I realized that if they were doing that and I signed over to them, my wives and children wouldn't have any future anyways.
[02:49:56.276 --> 02:49:57.657]  They'd probably die the day I got them back.
[02:49:58.078 --> 02:50:03.881]  You know, it was, uh, Andrew Jackson's mother died in a British concentration camp when he was 12 years old in a Revolutionary War.
[02:50:06.357 --> 02:50:11.198]  That's why I probably hated the British and the Natives so much, but he was a very hateful but also loving man.
[02:50:11.958 --> 02:50:15.279]  But, you know, I've gone through nothing compared to those men.
[02:50:16.079 --> 02:50:25.120]  And everything we stand on, Mike, is people that were willing to make the sacrifices and not be the sellouts and these stagnant folks that turn over to every new evil.
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:34.102]  And I see some Pakistani woman that doesn't criticize Pakistan killing hundreds of thousands of women a year, stoning them to death, cutting their genitals off.
[02:50:35.242 --> 02:50:43.991]  Calling me a terrorist from her sick high road and saying I'm complicit in domestic terror and should be arrested, along with MSNBC saying, and I know where they're going.
[02:50:45.272 --> 02:50:48.014]  So I'm not a terrorist, I'm the opposite.
[02:50:48.054 --> 02:50:51.518]  So they don't scare me, having Islamists telling me I'm a terrorist.
[02:50:51.558 --> 02:50:52.158]  We know the truth.
[02:50:53.779 --> 02:50:56.901]  They run everything against you that they themselves are doing.
[02:50:57.201 --> 02:51:03.585]  You know, I've called the media, quote, journo-terrorists for quite some time because it's a psychological terrorism.
[02:51:03.605 --> 02:51:04.706]  They terrorize the economy.
[02:51:04.846 --> 02:51:05.046]  Right.
[02:51:05.086 --> 02:51:06.427]  They want to implode the American family.
[02:51:06.567 --> 02:51:08.548]  They push race wars that end up in violence.
[02:51:08.568 --> 02:51:09.869]  They push the Ferguson violence.
[02:51:09.889 --> 02:51:11.570]  They push the war on police and cops.
[02:51:12.371 --> 02:51:15.473]  That is actual journo-terrorism, as I've called it.
[02:51:15.513 --> 02:51:19.175]  But they run everything that they're doing against you.
[02:51:19.535 --> 02:51:20.196]  So now they're going to
[02:51:20.376 --> 02:51:21.697]  They want to get rid of due process.
[02:51:21.737 --> 02:51:24.978]  Not that cops and things are perfect, but America's been great compared to other countries.
[02:51:24.998 --> 02:51:26.719]  They want to overthrow it so they're in charge.
[02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:28.840]  So see, that's my endgame, and I'll finish with this.
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:29.140]  Okay.
[02:51:30.541 --> 02:51:36.084]  My endgame is, I didn't realize how bad it was 25 years ago when I got involved, but I knew it was bad.
[02:51:36.144 --> 02:51:40.666]  And then I've successively gone through this fight and learned just how bad it is, and now I know I'm right.
[02:51:41.107 --> 02:51:43.068]  So my endgame is, I believe in humanity.
[02:51:43.288 --> 02:51:44.448]  I believe folks aren't cowards.
[02:51:44.908 --> 02:51:46.069]  I believe we're a rallying call.
[02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:47.110]  I believe that we're strong.
[02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:51.392]  We might be lucky and I might make it out and be able to be with my family and have a future.
[02:51:51.452 --> 02:52:02.237]  But if I have to get killed or put in prison or shut down or whatever that compendium is, I have to commit because the worse it gets, the more I know how right we were, so I've got to make this sacrifice or there's no future anyway.
[02:52:02.577 --> 02:52:06.479]  And so it's actually very honorable and I'm very actually blessed.
[02:52:06.859 --> 02:52:15.324]  I just get mad at myself when I burn with desire to be able to politically and culturally and spiritually beat these people that I'm weak enough and have enough problems that
[02:52:16.064 --> 02:52:19.148]  That I could have done a better job, or where they took it out of context, or how.
[02:52:19.428 --> 02:52:24.934]  But it doesn't matter how the strong man stumbled, as Teddy Roosevelt said, as the weak man sits there and talks about what he did in the arena.
[02:52:24.954 --> 02:52:27.397]  Will you guys print me Teddy Roosevelt's The Arena quote?
[02:52:28.057 --> 02:52:33.623]  What matters is who strove in the arena, and the great challenges, even when they failed, they were taking action.
[02:52:34.304 --> 02:52:35.305]  I really believe in humanity.
[02:52:35.345 --> 02:52:36.646]  I really believe in men and women.
[02:52:37.086 --> 02:52:38.547]  I'm actually for an open, free society.
[02:52:38.567 --> 02:52:39.908]  I actually believe in real culture.
[02:52:40.208 --> 02:52:56.798]  But I'm not going to be conquered by weaponized cultures brought in to dominate me by cold-blooded megacorporations led by crazy Satanist George Soros Nazi who literally has a heart on for any prosperous country and is a literal parasitic demon with his demonic devil worshiper son Alexander.
[02:52:57.398 --> 02:53:00.340]  And so I just cannot culturally and spiritually die.
[02:53:00.781 --> 02:53:02.682]  Giving into them feels like death already.
[02:53:03.083 --> 02:53:04.584]  So fighting them feels like life.
[02:53:04.864 --> 02:53:09.067]  So as bad as things get, it's the most alive I've ever been as I get closer to the truth.
[02:53:09.808 --> 02:53:12.610]  And this is a pivotal moment, actually, in U.S.
[02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:14.592]  history, in world history, the history of the Internet.
[02:53:14.972 --> 02:53:17.474]  This is the Alex Jones moment in history.
[02:53:17.514 --> 02:53:24.259]  And by that, I don't mean that it's about your personal circumstances, but about what you stand for.
[02:53:24.279 --> 02:53:25.420]  They smell the spirit.
[02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:26.641]  They smell the enemy.
[02:53:26.681 --> 02:53:27.261]  Yes, yes.
[02:53:27.921 --> 02:53:31.142]  We're looking at the mass decentralization of information control.
[02:53:31.563 --> 02:53:32.763]  And that is what terrifies them.
[02:53:33.083 --> 02:53:34.804]  I see two possible futures now, Alex.
[02:53:35.164 --> 02:53:38.865]  One future where you and us and the Patriots are victorious.
[02:53:39.465 --> 02:53:43.206]  Where CNN becomes obsolete because they have destroyed their own credibility.
[02:53:43.566 --> 02:53:45.407]  NBC News has destroyed their credibility.
[02:53:45.507 --> 02:53:47.328]  And a new golden age with big challenges.
[02:53:47.368 --> 02:53:47.608]  Yes.
[02:53:47.848 --> 02:53:49.688]  But at least we're meeting the challenges.
[02:53:49.708 --> 02:53:50.649]  I agree.
[02:53:50.669 --> 02:53:51.549]  We're at a crossroads.
[02:53:52.169 --> 02:54:11.881]  And actually, I see a future where InfoWars right here, this is a key national infrastructure for truthful information and reporting that tells the truth, that challenges the narratives of the status quo, and that fights for individual human freedom regardless of your skin color, regardless of your race, regardless of, you know, your gender, all those things.
[02:54:12.341 --> 02:54:14.522]  And that future, we can make it happen.
[02:54:14.722 --> 02:54:19.105]  But there's another dark future where we're overrun, where Lester Holt,
[02:54:19.825 --> 02:54:25.350]  Is the propagandist-in-chief, he becomes the gobbles of... He is their number one guy right now.
[02:54:25.770 --> 02:54:31.735]  Yeah, and CNN people and so on, I mean, they will enslave humanity for a thousand years if they can manage it.
[02:54:32.156 --> 02:54:36.699]  They are marching in the bootsteps of the Third Reich.
[02:54:36.739 --> 02:54:38.901]  They're trying to create a new Fourth Reich.
[02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:42.705]  The very same megabanks that funded Hitler own them.
[02:54:43.385 --> 02:54:45.386]  Well, absolutely, and look who they protect.
[02:54:45.827 --> 02:54:52.791]  They protect organizations that were literally part of the Third Reich, such as IG Farben, which was broken up.
[02:54:52.811 --> 02:54:53.111]  IBM.
[02:54:53.131 --> 02:54:54.852]  Yeah, IBM was part of the Holocaust.
[02:54:54.872 --> 02:54:58.214]  They ran the computing punch card systems to enslaved Jews.
[02:54:58.234 --> 02:55:00.836]  The history, people need to know the history.
[02:55:01.256 --> 02:55:02.757]  You're telling people the real history.
[02:55:02.777 --> 02:55:03.938]  And so are you, so let me add this.
[02:55:05.996 --> 02:55:08.118]  It's the fighting spirit they're scared of that anybody has.
[02:55:08.158 --> 02:55:10.599]  They know I can ignite that kind of the opposite of NPR like you do.
[02:55:10.619 --> 02:55:15.783]  The people you know, they're big, they're bad, they're evil, but the power you have is so incredible.
[02:55:15.863 --> 02:55:19.465]  Don't be intimidated by their evil and think, you better shut up.
[02:55:19.686 --> 02:55:23.648]  They want, the devil goes about like a lion seeing who he can devour.
[02:55:24.109 --> 02:55:25.630]  You've got to stand up and they'll move on.
[02:55:26.977 --> 02:55:27.818]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:55:27.858 --> 02:55:31.704]  They want you to be afraid to speak the truth because of social engineering pressure.
[02:55:32.245 --> 02:55:36.331]  They know that if you say... Look, self-censorship is the demon here.
[02:55:36.691 --> 02:55:39.756]  People self-censor themselves now on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:55:40.096 --> 02:55:42.900]  I can't even tell you how many people I've heard from who are video creators who say,
[02:55:43.922 --> 02:55:49.289]  They themselves stopped talking about you on YouTube because they saw what happened with other people getting banned.
[02:55:49.669 --> 02:55:54.516]  Just mentioning the name Alex Jones now is enough to get you banned on Twitter.
[02:55:54.616 --> 02:55:57.200]  And so if you give in to that, you just lost the whole beachhead.
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:55:57.680]  That's right.
[02:55:57.941 --> 02:56:00.104]  Everybody's saying Alex Jones, then they fail.
[02:56:01.129 --> 02:56:05.975]  And in this way, you know, you and what is happening to you has become bigger than you.
[02:56:06.455 --> 02:56:13.583]  It has become the rallying cry for internet freedom that, frankly, is a basic human right and a human dignity.
[02:56:13.603 --> 02:56:15.726]  I agree with you, but now they've miscalculated.
[02:56:15.886 --> 02:56:17.588]  So what do they do now that it blew up in their face?
[02:56:17.648 --> 02:56:20.111]  Well, they just, they say the feds raided us today.
[02:56:20.311 --> 02:56:20.992]  That's their next thing.
[02:56:21.212 --> 02:56:27.254]  Well, yeah, and now they have to engineer an event where you end up arrested.
[02:56:27.855 --> 02:56:29.035]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[02:56:29.295 --> 02:56:34.137]  I mean, you're smart because you see this in advance and you're counteracting it right up front.
[02:56:34.678 --> 02:56:35.598]  And they will fail.
[02:56:35.658 --> 02:56:40.620]  And by the way, if they try something like that, the outcry will be monumental.
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:41.780]  I want to be clear, though.
[02:56:42.081 --> 02:56:43.481]  You saw this coming months ago.
[02:56:43.501 --> 02:56:45.062]  You've been more pressing than I have.
[02:56:45.862 --> 02:56:47.283]  Mike, it's up to the listeners.
[02:56:47.423 --> 02:56:55.568]  If the listeners spread the videos and the articles that are on Infowars.com, if they tell the truth about obvious, the Democrats are like, they're going to kill us with no proof.
[02:56:55.648 --> 02:56:57.530]  I mean, it's obvious when it happens, they staged it.
[02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:58.870]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:56:59.351 --> 02:57:02.012]  If people spread the word, they will back off and not do it.
[02:57:02.313 --> 02:57:04.974]  That's why they were going to de-platform us when the terror attack came.
[02:57:05.595 --> 02:57:08.757]  Now, because we talked about it, they had to do it early, I believe.
[02:57:08.897 --> 02:57:09.777]  I think the evidence shows.
[02:57:10.098 --> 02:57:13.280]  And that's why they're panicked right now, because things aren't going the way they want it.
[02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:28.171]  I also pray, by the way, Alex, not only for our universal freedom, but I pray for the upcoming victims of whatever false flag they're going to carry out, because these globalist, evil, demonic creatures, they will murder human beings in order to silence you.
[02:57:28.191 --> 02:57:29.892]  I mean, think about that.
[02:57:30.252 --> 02:57:31.373]  Think about how evil that is.
[02:57:31.413 --> 02:57:33.555]  They will kill people to shut you down.
[02:57:34.611 --> 02:57:39.816]  We'll be back in a few minutes and then one more segment with Mike, then Roger Stone's coming in with Mike Adams, the co-host.
[02:57:40.297 --> 02:57:42.139]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:57:42.499 --> 02:57:43.900]  Videos are up there that are censored.
[02:57:44.041 --> 02:57:44.541]  Get them out.
[02:57:44.681 --> 02:57:45.782]  Upload them on your own platform.
[02:57:46.123 --> 02:57:47.644]  Fight back or lose everything.
[02:57:47.664 --> 02:57:48.385]  It's up to you now.
[02:57:53.544 --> 02:58:11.859]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:11.939 --> 02:58:17.364]  But the immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:58:18.244 --> 02:58:18.905]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:19.345 --> 02:58:22.188]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:58:22.828 --> 02:58:23.788]  And so much more.
[02:58:24.369 --> 02:58:25.489]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:25.709 --> 02:58:27.430]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:27.450 --> 02:58:33.132]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:33.252 --> 02:58:34.452]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:34.472 --> 02:58:36.393]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:36.493 --> 02:58:38.874]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:39.074 --> 02:58:40.335]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:40.515 --> 02:58:42.315]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:58:42.876 --> 02:58:43.496]  Immune Wall.
[02:58:43.596 --> 02:58:44.896]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:45.016 --> 02:58:46.197]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:51.576 --> 02:58:54.777]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:55.217 --> 02:58:56.537]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:57.017 --> 02:59:08.560]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:09.260 --> 02:59:14.341]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[02:59:15.121 --> 02:59:24.407]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:24.627 --> 02:59:29.270]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:29.290 --> 02:59:30.791]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:34.193 --> 02:59:43.796]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:43.896 --> 02:59:46.057]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[02:59:46.577 --> 02:59:51.478]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:59:54.799 --> 02:59:58.761]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[03:00:12.901 --> 03:00:15.162]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:15.522 --> 03:00:23.665]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:23.685 --> 03:00:35.389]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[03:00:35.689 --> 03:00:39.610]  They just give me a number.
[03:00:41.627 --> 03:00:42.007]  Number 13.
[03:00:42.067 --> 03:00:46.191]  Microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[03:00:46.991 --> 03:00:47.372]  George Soros.
[03:01:04.697 --> 03:01:08.538]  Infowars.com right now redirects to the top videos.
[03:01:08.598 --> 03:01:10.759]  In the next hour it's going to go up with our great crew.
[03:01:11.739 --> 03:01:15.841]  The video I did, warning of the false flag, it's imminent, guaranteed, 100% clear.
[03:01:16.341 --> 03:01:23.384]  It's like, you know, watching a storm roll in in late summer and knowing it's going to collide with another front and give you a thunderstorm.
[03:01:23.484 --> 03:01:24.224]  I mean, it's on.
[03:01:24.244 --> 03:01:26.084]  We're going to have those videos up.
[03:01:26.265 --> 03:01:28.365]  They have silenced us ahead of the big false flag.
[03:01:28.945 --> 03:01:29.426]  Here's what
[03:01:30.902 --> 03:01:37.927]  Teddy Roosevelt spoke about in Paris in 1910 when he gave a speech on April 23rd, the man in the arena.
[03:01:37.947 --> 03:01:39.388]  People ask, what is our destiny?
[03:01:39.948 --> 03:01:40.809]  It's being in the arena.
[03:01:41.946 --> 03:01:48.572]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[03:01:48.592 --> 03:02:00.903]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[03:02:01.503 --> 03:02:22.622]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall not be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[03:02:23.222 --> 03:02:24.864]  And that's, that's my endgame, that's it.
[03:02:25.757 --> 03:02:36.621]  And there are far too many cold and timid souls right now in America who are seeing their freedoms eroded by the hour, and they have not yet joined the fight for human freedom.
[03:02:36.821 --> 03:02:38.282]  They wonder why they feel so dead.
[03:02:38.302 --> 03:02:39.322]  It's because they didn't commit.
[03:02:39.342 --> 03:02:40.062]  That's right.
[03:02:40.302 --> 03:02:41.183]  Well, let me guess, Mike.
[03:02:41.263 --> 03:02:42.523]  I bet you're more alive than ever been.
[03:02:42.803 --> 03:02:44.324]  Yeah, well, that's true.
[03:02:44.384 --> 03:02:45.544]  I mean, there's more at stake.
[03:02:46.545 --> 03:02:48.165]  I can barely sleep for hours now.
[03:02:48.265 --> 03:02:49.526]  I'm bouncing off the walls.
[03:02:50.097 --> 03:02:50.578]  Well, think about it.
[03:02:50.638 --> 03:02:55.723]  Five years ago when I came on your show, I was this happy vegan guy, right?
[03:02:55.783 --> 03:03:01.289]  And today, it's like we're fighting for everything, our very survival, our right to exist.
[03:03:01.849 --> 03:03:03.111]  And there's so much at stake.
[03:03:03.151 --> 03:03:08.736]  And for whatever reason, God has put people like you and I and others in this position
[03:03:09.591 --> 03:03:17.860]  To even have this desperate voice to call for human freedom, to call for the most important protective rights.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:21.563]  And the enemy wants it shut down because it's the truth.
[03:03:21.623 --> 03:03:22.845]  Thank God for DredgeReport.com.
[03:03:23.285 --> 03:03:26.588]  He's the only guy when Noam Chomsky came out and said we were being censored, it was wrong, that linked to it.
[03:03:26.889 --> 03:03:30.032]  He's the only guy when Lester Holt said, Jones wants to kill me, I'm scared.
[03:03:30.372 --> 03:03:32.555]  What an outrageous, crazy lie.
[03:03:33.075 --> 03:03:35.677]  He linked to what I actually said, so thank God for DredgeReport.com.
[03:04:03.335 --> 03:04:09.380]  These Facebooks and YouTubes and Twitters, they're murdering their own credibility.
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:10.861]  They're killing themselves.
[03:04:10.881 --> 03:04:13.904]  Just like the NFL, Hollywood lost third, fourth in their audience.
[03:04:13.944 --> 03:04:14.424]  Exactly.
[03:04:14.444 --> 03:04:17.167]  This full commitment, they don't even want to do it.
[03:04:17.187 --> 03:04:18.308]  They're just forced to do it.
[03:04:18.968 --> 03:04:27.794]  Well, right, but they're announcing to the world that you cannot find speech on Twitter that Jack Dorsey himself does not like.
[03:04:27.834 --> 03:04:32.657]  And actually, it's not just Jack Dorsey, it's his own internal lynch mob staff.
[03:04:33.017 --> 03:04:38.061]  His staff is a lynch mob to him, telling him to ban you, and that's what he's responded to.
[03:04:38.121 --> 03:04:42.964]  So he has given in to the lynch mob, and that is happening in every tech company all around Silicon Valley.
[03:04:43.504 --> 03:04:48.029]  Yesterday I was saying, don't give in to the lynch mob, and I was at Cruz, at Twitter, stop it, they just banned our feed.
[03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:50.432]  Their message was, we are in control.
[03:04:50.952 --> 03:04:51.933]  We control the set.
[03:04:52.294 --> 03:04:54.817]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams and Roger Stone together.
[03:04:54.837 --> 03:04:55.397]  That's a first.
[03:04:55.738 --> 03:04:57.580]  Spread the live links, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:57.960 --> 03:04:59.382]  Only you can stop the globalist.
[03:04:59.542 --> 03:05:00.002]  Only you.
[03:05:02.352 --> 03:05:06.075]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:05:06.215 --> 03:05:11.278]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:57.544]  Very, very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[03:05:57.824 --> 03:06:00.665]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:00.705 --> 03:06:02.146]  Huge discount store wide right now.
[03:06:25.379 --> 03:06:32.866]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:06:33.366 --> 03:06:46.458]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:06:47.919 --> 03:06:51.260]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space-sense.
[03:06:51.721 --> 03:06:55.842]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:06:56.062 --> 03:07:00.084]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[03:07:00.851 --> 03:07:16.961]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[03:07:17.161 --> 03:07:17.881]  InfoWars.
[03:07:18.262 --> 03:07:19.162]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:07:19.462 --> 03:07:21.524]  We're not gonna make America great again.
[03:07:21.544 --> 03:07:23.585]  It was never that great.
[03:07:27.307 --> 03:07:29.989]  We have not reached greatness.
[03:07:31.457 --> 03:07:38.801]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[03:07:39.442 --> 03:07:47.666]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population, is gone.
[03:07:53.874 --> 03:07:56.016]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:07:56.056 --> 03:07:58.938]  This is Mike Adams co-hosting with Roger Stone.
[03:07:58.978 --> 03:07:59.599]  This is a first.
[03:07:59.979 --> 03:08:03.422]  Never had the honor of sitting here and hosting with Roger Stone.
[03:08:03.462 --> 03:08:05.023]  Roger, it's great to actually meet you in person.
[03:08:05.043 --> 03:08:05.824]  We've never met before.
[03:08:05.844 --> 03:08:06.844]  It's great to be with you.
[03:08:07.024 --> 03:08:09.687]  I admire a lot of your work and I'm a health
[03:08:10.387 --> 03:08:12.789]  And natural supplement aficionado myself.
[03:08:12.989 --> 03:08:13.810]  That's great.
[03:08:14.050 --> 03:08:16.512]  Long history of Chinese medicine.
[03:08:16.532 --> 03:08:19.854]  I go to acupuncture prophylactically.
[03:08:19.874 --> 03:08:21.615]  I practice Tai Chi.
[03:08:22.156 --> 03:08:25.959]  I've used Chinese herbalistic medicine for a good 30 years.
[03:08:26.499 --> 03:08:28.700]  Wow, I did not know that about you.
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:29.980]  That's great to hear.
[03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:33.661]  We have to keep our longevity up because we're all under such attacks.
[03:08:33.721 --> 03:08:45.545]  And on that topic, you are under intense assaults, you could say, by Robert Mueller, who I think is running a horrific, illegal witch hunt against not just you, but against America.
[03:08:45.605 --> 03:08:47.185]  He's running it against this country.
[03:08:47.245 --> 03:08:51.167]  But what are the latest developments or concerns on your part?
[03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:54.368]  Well, it's a horrific experience because it really is.
[03:08:54.528 --> 03:08:55.388]  It's an inquisition.
[03:08:57.228 --> 03:09:00.490]  Robert Mueller has no oversight from anyone.
[03:09:01.410 --> 03:09:10.975]  The courts have ruled that his appointment is legal because he has the oversight of Acting Attorney General on this matter, Rod Rosenstein, and the President.
[03:09:11.355 --> 03:09:16.658]  But since both of them are, at a minimum, witnesses in the matter that he's investigating, and perhaps more...
[03:09:17.939 --> 03:09:19.800]  There's an inherent conflict of interest there.
[03:09:20.501 --> 03:09:29.530]  As I'm sure you have read, they have prodded dozens of my friends before the grand jury in desperate search of some crime, but they've been unable to find one.
[03:09:30.331 --> 03:09:35.055]  Multiple sources tell me that the crime of defrauding the United States
[03:09:35.916 --> 03:09:50.269]  Is what they have in mind, but there's no evidence of that because, let me say it for the 9000th time, I never received anything from the Russians or WikiLeaks or anyone else, including allegedly hacked emails.
[03:09:50.729 --> 03:09:56.134]  I never passed anything on to Donald Trump, because when you don't receive anything, there's nothing to pass on.
[03:09:56.835 --> 03:09:57.716]  It's a false narrative.
[03:09:57.756 --> 03:10:01.759]  It's a threadbare narrative constantly pushed by the dorks at MSNBC.
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:08.461]  The thing is, Roger, and this is what's horrifying about our current situation, is they don't need a factual crime.
[03:10:08.902 --> 03:10:16.483]  They don't need any evidence to smear you, even to lock you up, even to pull what they did with Paul Manafort on you.
[03:10:16.903 --> 03:10:26.006]  All they need is to convince or sufficiently threaten someone who has been close to you to fabricate some false claim against you, and then they could use that to take away your liberties.
[03:10:26.286 --> 03:10:31.307]  I mean, we are living in a society now where the truth no longer matters to the deep state
[03:10:31.607 --> 03:10:32.728]  And they have too much power!
[03:10:32.888 --> 03:10:33.889]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:10:33.969 --> 03:10:45.857]  So, in this lawsuit against me by this Obama-controlled front group, which I got dismissed several weeks ago, they lay out the same threadbare false narrative yet again.
[03:10:46.838 --> 03:10:49.620]  The Russians hacked the DNC.
[03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:51.021]  First of all, there's no proof of that.
[03:10:52.422 --> 03:10:58.946]  And they gave the allegedly hacked emails to Roger Stone, who passed them on to WikiLeaks.
[03:10:59.026 --> 03:11:02.829]  Or they gave them to WikiLeaks, who passed them on to Stone, who passed them on to Trump.
[03:11:03.329 --> 03:11:09.533]  And when they're pressed in court for their evidence, they point to a fake news clipping and say, see, here it is.
[03:11:09.593 --> 03:11:10.174]  It's in writing.
[03:11:10.214 --> 03:11:10.654]  Here it is.
[03:11:10.774 --> 03:11:10.934]  Right.
[03:11:10.994 --> 03:11:11.735]  Circular logic.
[03:11:11.815 --> 03:11:12.035]  Right.
[03:11:12.375 --> 03:11:16.498]  But let's equate this to what's going on here at Infowars, because I think it's really important.
[03:11:17.078 --> 03:11:30.931]  The effort to silence me, the effort to incarcerate me and take me off InfoWars is part of the very same effort to silence Alex Jones and shut InfoWars down.
[03:11:31.652 --> 03:11:34.195]  This is part and parcel of a grander scheme.
[03:11:34.855 --> 03:11:35.115]  Why?
[03:11:35.916 --> 03:11:38.358]  I think it's because we've been extraordinarily effective.
[03:11:38.739 --> 03:11:41.801]  I think it's because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:11:41.861 --> 03:11:57.495]  And because Alex Jones has been in the forefront of exposing the globalist plan for one world government, the inordinate amount of Chinese communist influence in this country, and the fact that our major institutions are being sold to them one by one.
[03:11:58.956 --> 03:12:01.978]  Apple being the single worst transgressor.
[03:12:02.738 --> 03:12:04.519]  And therefore they want to shut me up.
[03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:05.960]  They want to shut Jones up.
[03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:07.561]  They want to shut Infowars down.
[03:12:07.922 --> 03:12:10.023]  It's all part of the same plan.
[03:12:10.083 --> 03:12:11.664]  They're willing to do anything.
[03:12:11.824 --> 03:12:12.645]  I mean anything.
[03:12:12.805 --> 03:12:13.585]  Lawless things.
[03:12:13.826 --> 03:12:15.166]  Violent things to make that happen.
[03:12:15.467 --> 03:12:22.371]  You know, Alex and I are both convinced that they are going to stage some kind of huge attack.
[03:12:22.491 --> 03:12:23.652]  Some real violence.
[03:12:23.812 --> 03:12:25.093]  Yeah, this is a precursor.
[03:12:25.453 --> 03:12:26.794]  This is a precursor.
[03:12:26.834 --> 03:12:27.575]  There's no question.
[03:12:28.075 --> 03:12:32.218]  I haven't asked you though, what do you think is the most likely scenario that they would run?
[03:12:33.038 --> 03:12:47.067]  Well, I think it's kind of obvious that an attack on some news organization or some reporter, on some prominent news person, perhaps somebody will mount an attack on Lester Holt.
[03:12:48.007 --> 03:12:54.752]  But it won't be Alex Jones, it won't be Infowars, it won't be anyone affiliated with us, because we don't believe in violence.
[03:12:55.212 --> 03:12:58.114]  Violence would be counterproductive to where we are right now.
[03:12:59.175 --> 03:13:01.116]  I subscribe to the views of Dr. King.
[03:13:02.097 --> 03:13:08.402]  I'm for civil disobedience, if necessary, but I'm for peaceful protest in massive numbers.
[03:13:08.902 --> 03:13:10.443]  Peaceful protest brings change.
[03:13:10.463 --> 03:13:11.004]  We've seen it.
[03:13:11.784 --> 03:13:24.088]  But no matter how many times you say peaceful protests and that you find violence abhorrent, they will take those two words, protest and violence, and they'll put them together and they'll say, Roger Stone called for violent protests.
[03:13:24.268 --> 03:13:24.448]  Right.
[03:13:24.468 --> 03:13:25.928]  I mean, it's so dishonest.
[03:13:25.988 --> 03:13:31.730]  I mean, one of the things that really aggravates me is that the Sovereign Poverty Law Center, which is a hate group.
[03:13:32.350 --> 03:13:35.952]  I've just publicly declared them a hate group, by the way, and a financial scam.
[03:13:36.412 --> 03:13:39.513]  Morris Dees is just coining it, taking it out of the country.
[03:13:39.654 --> 03:13:40.274]  He's a criminal.
[03:13:40.694 --> 03:13:41.314]  Let's just say it.
[03:13:42.155 --> 03:13:44.276]  That's a financial scam, is what that is.
[03:13:44.616 --> 03:13:53.360]  He was one of the progenitors who first understood direct mail fundraising back in the 60s, and his whole Southern Poverty Law is a fraud, folks.
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:57.202]  And if you're giving $25, stop, because it's a scam.
[03:13:57.422 --> 03:13:58.703]  All they're doing is pocketing your money.
[03:13:59.603 --> 03:14:03.348]  Uh, they have recently declared the Proud Boys to be a hate group.
[03:14:03.368 --> 03:14:03.869]  Right, right.
[03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:06.412]  I've addressed the Proud Boys groups.
[03:14:06.652 --> 03:14:07.753]  They renounce violence.
[03:14:08.354 --> 03:14:10.257]  They don't renounce self-defense.
[03:14:10.497 --> 03:14:10.837]  That's right.
[03:14:11.138 --> 03:14:13.200]  If they're attacked, they will respond.
[03:14:13.721 --> 03:14:14.562]  That's my position.
[03:14:14.622 --> 03:14:15.984]  That's Alex Jones's position.
[03:14:16.044 --> 03:14:16.444]  But now...
[03:14:17.325 --> 03:14:24.547]  Just having spoken to one of their groups, or just having friends who are in that organization, you're called a terrorist.
[03:14:24.867 --> 03:14:26.107]  It is outrageous.
[03:14:26.547 --> 03:14:28.247]  The Proud Boys is not a hate group.
[03:14:28.508 --> 03:14:29.888]  They are not white supremacists.
[03:14:30.288 --> 03:14:31.048]  That is a lie.
[03:14:31.408 --> 03:14:32.308]  But this is the thing.
[03:14:32.668 --> 03:14:34.849]  They accuse you of the things that they are.
[03:14:35.189 --> 03:14:38.170]  The SPLC, in my view as well, is a hate group.
[03:14:38.190 --> 03:14:44.311]  They are spreading hatred that could invoke violence, and yet they accuse you of exactly what they're doing.
[03:14:44.631 --> 03:14:46.552]  One good tax audit would shut them down.
[03:14:46.572 --> 03:14:48.853]  It's a financial scam.
[03:14:48.973 --> 03:14:49.813]  It's a fraud.
[03:14:50.073 --> 03:14:56.336]  They are enriching themselves while claiming to oppose hate and extremism.
[03:14:56.756 --> 03:14:57.617]  They are the haters.
[03:14:58.037 --> 03:14:59.077]  They are the extremists.
[03:14:59.418 --> 03:15:00.418]  They are the con men.
[03:15:00.778 --> 03:15:02.439]  Morris Dees is a con man.
[03:15:03.179 --> 03:15:04.700]  This whole thing is a financial fraud.
[03:15:05.532 --> 03:15:09.595]  And by the way, I'm going to add one other thing to the potential false flag theory here.
[03:15:10.115 --> 03:15:32.930]  I think that given the importance of 3D printed guns right now, and the ghost gunner technology where you can mill out your own AR-15 lower, I think the perfect storm of a false flag would be for them to frame up somebody who's an Alex Jones supporter, who 3D printed a gun, who attacked CNN, and who voted for President Trump, and who bought your book.
[03:15:33.010 --> 03:15:34.631]  I mean, that's like the ultimate
[03:15:35.351 --> 03:15:44.239]  Yeah, there's no doubt they're going to find a copy of Stone's Rules in the alleged shooter's apartment or in the basement where he lives with his parents.
[03:15:44.719 --> 03:15:46.040]  Look, this is a fraud, folks.
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:47.802]  We got 10 seconds.
[03:15:47.842 --> 03:15:48.562]  You're on notice.
[03:15:48.783 --> 03:15:51.405]  If there is violence, it has nothing to do with Infowars.
[03:15:51.605 --> 03:15:52.305]  We renounce it.
[03:15:52.806 --> 03:15:53.346]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:53.366 --> 03:15:53.787]  Stay with us.
[03:16:01.825 --> 03:16:09.768]  There was some bad news recently for extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist and bath salt spokesmodel Alex Jones.
[03:16:10.448 --> 03:16:15.089]  Because it looks like his website InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[03:16:19.496 --> 03:16:21.258]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[03:16:21.638 --> 03:16:23.199]  I think the things he says are awful.
[03:16:23.219 --> 03:16:24.360]  He makes me physically sick.
[03:16:24.420 --> 03:16:32.926]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[03:16:32.986 --> 03:16:36.048]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[03:16:36.208 --> 03:16:39.971]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[03:16:40.191 --> 03:16:42.672]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[03:16:42.712 --> 03:16:46.374]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:16:46.654 --> 03:16:49.135]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:16:49.255 --> 03:16:58.459]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[03:16:58.799 --> 03:16:59.740]  So, if...
[03:17:02.193 --> 03:17:02.593]  We're gone.
[03:17:02.974 --> 03:17:03.614]  We're out of there.
[03:17:03.775 --> 03:17:19.030]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers, alleging that these were merely actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[03:17:19.090 --> 03:17:20.672]  David Hogg, a day after the event,
[03:17:21.252 --> 03:17:25.996]  Started working for the Democratic Party in Soros, flying around on private jets, being anti-gun spokesperson.
[03:17:26.376 --> 03:17:35.903]  I said he's a PR man, and that he was an actor at the school, part of the drama club, so he's well-spoken, and he's been chosen to be anti-gun.
[03:17:35.943 --> 03:17:38.906]  I said I believe people died, and I believe he's a real student.
[03:17:39.206 --> 03:17:44.510]  But they misrepresented and said that I bullied him and said that nobody died, even though he's a public figure.
[03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:45.831]  I would have a right to say that.
[03:17:45.971 --> 03:17:47.172]  I didn't say that.
[03:17:47.272 --> 03:17:55.918]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[03:17:55.958 --> 03:18:07.667]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack happened and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy.
[03:18:08.067 --> 03:18:09.908]  I did not post a video doing that.
[03:18:10.288 --> 03:18:11.388]  It was all over the news.
[03:18:11.668 --> 03:18:13.029]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[03:18:13.789 --> 03:18:18.091]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I'd said that I didn't say it.
[03:18:18.871 --> 03:18:28.534]  And you got your asses kicked because I had InfoWars.com and I had NewsWars.com and I was able to counter and show what I said.
[03:18:28.594 --> 03:18:30.715]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[03:18:31.604 --> 03:18:38.932]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[03:18:39.113 --> 03:18:47.062]  Our reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[03:18:47.082 --> 03:18:49.965]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[03:18:50.405 --> 03:18:51.907]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[03:18:52.768 --> 03:18:56.490]  Like, you know, good friends, family... He said CNN's not calling anymore.
[03:18:56.610 --> 03:19:02.633]  And I say, well, you know, tell me if you're so... you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[03:19:02.713 --> 03:19:08.715]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article saying, paraphrasing what you said.
[03:19:08.735 --> 03:19:11.196]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[03:19:11.577 --> 03:19:15.178]  And when I go find it, I say, well, that's not really what was said here.
[03:19:15.198 --> 03:19:17.659]  Well, then, you know, then there's like this back pedal.
[03:19:17.699 --> 03:19:21.001]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[03:19:21.221 --> 03:19:24.443]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions.
[03:19:24.943 --> 03:19:27.384]  All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones.
[03:19:27.864 --> 03:19:31.506]  Because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[03:19:31.546 --> 03:19:36.708]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:19:36.868 --> 03:19:37.669]  Alex Jones.
[03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:38.689]  Alex Jones.
[03:19:38.849 --> 03:19:39.689]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.630]  Infowars.
[03:19:40.690 --> 03:19:41.490]  Alex Jones.
[03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:42.591]  From Infowars.
[03:19:42.751 --> 03:19:43.051]  Infowars.
[03:19:43.391 --> 03:19:49.313]  I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than, like, Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:19:49.814 --> 03:19:53.715]  But he's got a point of view, and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[03:19:53.735 --> 03:19:59.217]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him, prevent him from speaking.
[03:20:04.419 --> 03:20:07.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.230 --> 03:20:21.394]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:20:21.855 --> 03:20:25.478]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.739 --> 03:20:26.840]  Welcome back!
[03:20:29.986 --> 03:20:30.927]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:20:31.287 --> 03:20:35.231]  You're here on the Alex Jones Show with me as Mike Adams.
[03:20:36.333 --> 03:20:41.358]  And it's a perfect time to remind you that we are under siege as never before.
[03:20:42.639 --> 03:20:49.646]  With the mainstream media doing everything they possibly can to shut down InfoWars, with this across-the-board purge,
[03:20:50.827 --> 03:20:53.489]  on social media of the InfoWars message.
[03:20:53.950 --> 03:20:58.092]  It's more important than ever that you go to the InfoWars.com store and support us.
[03:20:58.813 --> 03:21:00.074]  This is our lifeblood.
[03:21:00.734 --> 03:21:02.215]  This is what keeps us moving.
[03:21:02.255 --> 03:21:12.583]  We don't have any big multinational corporate sponsors writing enormous checks to underwrite the important work that's done here at InfoWars and therefore we can only depend on you.
[03:21:13.283 --> 03:21:18.707]  And right now at the InfoWars.com site, we have some of the most incredible specials we've ever featured.
[03:21:19.547 --> 03:21:22.950]  For example, Brain Force Plus at 40% off.
[03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:27.313]  Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality at 50% off.
[03:21:28.994 --> 03:21:31.596]  Secret 12 at 40% off.
[03:21:32.196 --> 03:21:35.358]  Interestingly, winter sun at 40% off.
[03:21:35.858 --> 03:21:39.760]  People assume you only need winter sun in the winter time, but it's not true.
[03:21:40.180 --> 03:21:49.746]  When it's hot outside and you spend more time in the air conditioning, you're getting less sunlight and therefore less vitamin D. Winter sun can be of enormous assistance right now.
[03:21:49.766 --> 03:21:50.146]  40% off.
[03:21:51.967 --> 03:21:55.769]  Survival Shield X2 at 40% off.
[03:21:56.209 --> 03:21:58.650]  One of my all-time favorites, Silver Bullet.
[03:21:58.750 --> 03:22:12.895]  It's interesting because the colloidal silver formula, which has an electronic distilling process, and therefore smaller molecules, allows for greater absorption in the Silver Bullet product.
[03:22:13.415 --> 03:22:19.478]  In my opinion, the very best colloidal silver product on the market today, available at the Infowars.com store.
[03:22:20.038 --> 03:22:21.259]  We need your support, folks.
[03:22:21.359 --> 03:22:22.339]  Please go to the store.
[03:22:22.859 --> 03:22:34.224]  The AutoShip program is the best because when you lock in on a product that you really like, that really works for you, you don't have to remember every month to reorder.
[03:22:34.605 --> 03:22:40.047]  And a small store of it is put aside so that you're never without.
[03:22:40.107 --> 03:22:43.769]  You're never in a position where they're out of your favorite product.
[03:22:43.829 --> 03:22:48.771]  So please go to the Infowars.com store now and support us in the fight for freedom.
[03:22:48.831 --> 03:23:12.118]  Let me just add to that, Roger, because, you know, my background is as a nutritionist and a food scientist, and for those of you who are fans of InfoWars, if you have dark skin color, if you're African-American, if you are Latino, you're absorbing less sunlight than those of us who have more fair skin, and many of you, if you have an indoor job, you can be so chronically deficient in vitamin D, and your doctor will never tell you.
[03:23:12.338 --> 03:23:12.538]  Right.
[03:23:12.558 --> 03:23:13.278]  They'll never tell you.
[03:23:13.638 --> 03:23:14.779]  Go get your vitamin D tested.
[03:23:15.339 --> 03:23:22.806]  You'll find probably in many cases it's so low, if you're not supplementing, that you need to supplement to bring that up to a normal range.
[03:23:23.046 --> 03:23:33.975]  And even, you know, fair-skinned people who work indoors a lot and, you know, here you and I are inside, you know, we'd probably rather be outside somewhere, frankly, but here we are, so we have to supplement as well.
[03:23:34.716 --> 03:23:36.937]  Yeah, it'd be tougher to get much whiter than I am.
[03:23:38.378 --> 03:23:39.739]  So you're absolutely right.
[03:23:39.819 --> 03:23:42.421]  But people say a winter sun, I only need that in the winter.
[03:23:42.441 --> 03:23:43.602]  It's actually not true.
[03:23:43.742 --> 03:23:44.302]  It's year-round.
[03:23:45.183 --> 03:23:45.903]  There's no question.
[03:23:45.943 --> 03:23:48.705]  What I like about the Infowars products is the way they take
[03:23:49.870 --> 03:24:05.978]  Ancient proven Chinese herbalistic principles and ingredients, and then they merge them with some cutting-edge nutraceuticals to produce some of the most effective products out there at prices that are far lower than you can find anywhere else.
[03:24:06.279 --> 03:24:15.803]  That's what's crazy about it, and I know we're not going to spend this whole segment plugging here, but just as one more note, you know, we've looked into retail distribution of nutritional products.
[03:24:16.204 --> 03:24:18.125]  If you go into retail like Whole Foods,
[03:24:19.085 --> 03:24:31.155]  You have to give Whole Foods something like 60% off your selling price, which means that then Whole Foods makes some money, but you have to cheapen your product to get it into that store.
[03:24:31.495 --> 03:24:32.877]  And not just Whole Foods, but many others.
[03:24:32.937 --> 03:24:38.922]  But by selling direct, InfoWars is able to put more ingredients in the product because they don't have a middleman.
[03:24:39.542 --> 03:24:46.984]  Yeah, not only that, but you're not getting filler, you're not getting inferior ingredients, you're getting the very best quality stuff.
[03:24:47.004 --> 03:24:54.146]  Look, I have been using alternative medicine, I've been using herbals and all natural supplements for a good 40 years.
[03:24:54.766 --> 03:25:00.967]  I've never had the success I've had with the InfoWars products anywhere else, and the price is right!
[03:25:01.067 --> 03:25:04.668]  You're not going to find this kind of quality at these kind of prices anywhere else.
[03:25:04.708 --> 03:25:06.228]  So folks, go to the store now.
[03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:08.429]  We need you to have our back.
[03:25:09.570 --> 03:25:13.553]  This is a segue to the economic warfare that they are carrying out against InfoWars.
[03:25:14.133 --> 03:25:29.184]  All of the bans of the key infrastructure, you know, the MailChimp being taken away, Disqus comment engine, the Shopify payments ban of one of their smaller stores, all of these things, Roger, are attacks on key business infrastructure.
[03:25:29.544 --> 03:25:33.187]  And if you look at what's happening in society today, these lynch mob liberals
[03:25:33.387 --> 03:25:33.567]  I think?
[03:26:03.607 --> 03:26:04.628]  Not the color of their skin.
[03:26:05.128 --> 03:26:07.749]  And we have to return to that kind of civil rights movement right now.
[03:26:08.430 --> 03:26:12.191]  I apologize for taking the mic here, but... I could not agree more.
[03:26:12.351 --> 03:26:16.514]  I mean, look, people are often shocked when they ask me, who are your political heroes?
[03:26:16.534 --> 03:26:17.414]  Well, some of them you know.
[03:26:17.714 --> 03:26:18.354]  Ronald Reagan.
[03:26:18.815 --> 03:26:19.675]  Dwight Eisenhower.
[03:26:19.915 --> 03:26:20.876]  Yes, Richard Nixon.
[03:26:21.636 --> 03:26:22.937]  Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
[03:26:23.037 --> 03:26:23.677]  People say, what?
[03:26:23.837 --> 03:26:24.017]  What?
[03:26:24.217 --> 03:26:24.397]  What?
[03:26:24.537 --> 03:26:25.138]  How could that be?
[03:26:25.598 --> 03:26:26.879]  Because he stood for civil rights.
[03:26:27.519 --> 03:26:30.941]  We need to go back to that, where all people are treated equal.
[03:26:31.081 --> 03:26:34.062]  Under our current system, that's not what this revolution is about.
[03:26:34.282 --> 03:26:35.663]  They are trying to silence people.
[03:26:36.283 --> 03:26:44.467]  Three weekends ago, I was in an Italian restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with my grandchildren, my children, my wife, my entire family.
[03:26:44.487 --> 03:26:47.809]  It's rare we all get together for dinner because my kids are so active.
[03:26:49.268 --> 03:26:56.394]  Two activists decide they want to come up to the table and start calling me a traitor, calling me a Russian agent, and much worse.
[03:26:56.454 --> 03:26:57.315]  And I'm like, really?
[03:26:58.096 --> 03:27:00.338]  On Sunday afternoon when I'm trying to have dinner with my family?
[03:27:01.359 --> 03:27:03.781]  You want to pick on me, pick me on the street, you'll regret it.
[03:27:04.321 --> 03:27:08.266]  But they claim they're tolerant and they're inclusive and they're polite and progressive.
[03:27:08.526 --> 03:27:12.290]  And they demonstrate that by badgering you in a public place.
[03:27:12.390 --> 03:27:14.733]  And calling you obscene names in front of children.
[03:27:15.253 --> 03:27:18.937]  It's despicable, but it's part and parcel of the left.
[03:27:19.258 --> 03:27:19.838]  They're losing.
[03:27:19.898 --> 03:27:22.421]  That's why they are so damn hysterical.
[03:27:22.621 --> 03:27:23.162]  They're losing.
[03:27:23.402 --> 03:27:25.563]  It's almost mass mental illness.
[03:27:25.603 --> 03:27:28.065]  I mean, we seriously have to call it that.
[03:27:28.145 --> 03:27:32.627]  Look, I don't want to dwell on this issue because I want to ask you about the Manafort trial.
[03:27:33.488 --> 03:27:35.029]  What do you know about the latest developments?
[03:27:35.089 --> 03:27:50.698]  I believe that's gone to a... Well, I have one interesting observation, and that is at trial, both in the drawings and as described in a number of the stories, Manafort is wearing a suit and tie, but no socks.
[03:27:52.011 --> 03:28:00.299]  Now, because he's taken back to prison every night during the time that he's on trial, even though he's been convicted of nothing yet, it's kind of odd.
[03:28:00.880 --> 03:28:02.842]  He's not allowed to have a belt.
[03:28:02.862 --> 03:28:07.026]  He's not allowed to have shoelaces, because you could commit suicide with those.
[03:28:07.506 --> 03:28:09.228]  I'm not sure how they allow him a tie.
[03:28:09.808 --> 03:28:13.992]  But he is allowed to have prison-issue socks, which are white.
[03:28:14.773 --> 03:28:19.797]  Except for Manafort refuses to wear white socks with a suit, and that's why he's barefoot.
[03:28:20.277 --> 03:28:33.268]  So despite his garish choices of wardrobe, because I've been a critic of his expensive wardrobe, not that he doesn't have the right to buy it, but that his taste is not mine, he refuses to wear white socks with a suit.
[03:28:33.348 --> 03:28:35.229]  So he's been redeemed in my eyes.
[03:28:36.390 --> 03:28:40.714]  I don't know about the efficacy of a strategy in which he offers no defense.
[03:28:41.474 --> 03:28:44.915]  This is odd to me, but that is what his lawyers have chosen.
[03:28:44.935 --> 03:28:48.176]  As I understand it, the jury is out, I believe, and we wait.
[03:28:48.396 --> 03:28:50.297]  There could be a decision as early as today or tomorrow.
[03:28:50.397 --> 03:28:51.077]  Very possible.
[03:28:51.177 --> 03:28:52.738]  You're here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.898 --> 03:28:57.699]  Please, we'll be right back with more of Alex Jones.
[03:28:58.280 --> 03:28:59.320]  Mike, Roger Stone.
[03:29:01.598 --> 03:29:05.920]  We have the new t-shirt we're selling because they have Impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[03:29:05.940 --> 03:29:08.982]  We have Reelect Trump at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:09.002 --> 03:29:10.043]  Reelect 45.
[03:29:10.903 --> 03:29:13.684]  So it's Reelect, not the other one.
[03:29:13.724 --> 03:29:14.885]  That's now exclusively available.
[03:29:15.045 --> 03:29:16.586]  They're getting printed right here, right here in Texas.

[03:29:20.868 --> 03:29:23.409]  And then we have, we have Mean Like a Wolverine.
[03:29:23.429 --> 03:29:25.650]  It's not the Marvel comic wimpy Wolverine.
[03:29:25.690 --> 03:29:26.771]  It's the Trump Wolverine.
[03:29:27.051 --> 03:29:28.992]  That's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:29.172 --> 03:29:31.213]  Be sure and get those and find the operation.
[03:29:31.653 --> 03:29:35.235]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:29:35.635 --> 03:29:38.056]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:29:38.376 --> 03:29:42.718]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[03:29:43.178 --> 03:29:45.039]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[03:31:35.444 --> 03:31:35.905]  Have you heard?
[03:31:36.385 --> 03:31:38.447]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[03:31:38.527 --> 03:31:39.828]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[03:31:40.028 --> 03:31:41.049]  They're all censoring us.
[03:31:41.410 --> 03:31:47.316]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[03:31:47.616 --> 03:31:50.639]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.

[03:33:05.413 --> 03:33:08.174]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.034 --> 03:33:23.400]  Big Brother.
[03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:25.280]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:25.901 --> 03:33:27.041]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:27.501 --> 03:33:28.542]  You want answers?
[03:33:29.062 --> 03:33:30.262]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:30.682 --> 03:33:34.384]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:39.099 --> 03:33:42.402]  Alright, we are here live on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[03:33:42.422 --> 03:33:45.604]  A rare joining of personalities here.
[03:33:45.684 --> 03:33:49.568]  Roger Stone and Mike Adams bringing it in for you again for another segment.
[03:33:49.888 --> 03:33:57.194]  We were just chatting during the break about how unbelievable it is that we find ourselves in the situation that we're in today.
[03:33:57.314 --> 03:34:00.837]  The assaults on the basic freedoms that we have enjoyed so long.
[03:34:01.317 --> 03:34:06.781]  Being Americans in this country, the economic sabotage, the lawlessness of federal prosecutors.
[03:34:07.901 --> 03:34:10.983]  You were just telling me, just astonished, that you never could have predicted this, Roger.
[03:34:11.004 --> 03:34:11.544]  What are your thoughts?
[03:34:11.824 --> 03:34:18.669]  No, I mean, if you told me two, three years ago that we'd have less civility in our country rather than more, I would never have believed it.
[03:34:18.709 --> 03:34:20.830]  Look, I'm a hard-edged partisan, okay?
[03:34:20.850 --> 03:34:21.871]  I'm a real conservative.
[03:34:22.351 --> 03:34:23.812]  I'm a libertarian conservative.
[03:34:24.673 --> 03:34:30.837]  My views on some issues are not orthodox right-wing conservatism.
[03:34:31.697 --> 03:34:33.338]  And I have many friends who are Democrats.
[03:34:33.578 --> 03:34:34.878]  I have many friends who are liberals.
[03:34:35.399 --> 03:34:37.659]  But I hear from them less and less.
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:55.306]  And I see there's an entire movement backwards where you can't go out on the street, you can't walk through an airport, you can't walk through a restaurant, you can't walk down the street in Manhattan, for example, without somebody wanting to get in your face and call you names.
[03:34:55.526 --> 03:35:10.567]  That's what's astonishing about this is this complete lack of civility by people who themselves claim to be the good people in society, but they are filled with so much hatred while they demand that you be banned for hate speech in the case of Alex.
[03:35:10.927 --> 03:35:12.650]  But it's also economic sabotage.
[03:35:13.010 --> 03:35:18.072]  And I believe you said earlier, you're facing as much as potentially, what, $2 million in legal bills?
[03:35:18.552 --> 03:35:19.032]  Or more.
[03:35:19.172 --> 03:35:22.993]  Look, this threatens to destroy me financially, which is part of the plan, you see.
[03:35:23.033 --> 03:35:24.033]  They wear you out.
[03:35:25.394 --> 03:35:28.355]  You can find stories online that say Roger Stone is worth $20 million.
[03:35:29.355 --> 03:35:31.618]  Folks, I am not worth $20 million.
[03:35:31.678 --> 03:35:32.378]  Not even close.
[03:35:32.438 --> 03:35:33.399]  I'm not a wealthy man.
[03:35:33.940 --> 03:35:35.982]  It threatens to destroy me, to bankrupt my family.
[03:35:36.383 --> 03:35:39.946]  I've had to set up a legal defense fund, stonedefensefund.com.
[03:35:40.367 --> 03:35:41.288]  There's the address.
[03:35:42.089 --> 03:35:45.112]  Anything you send will be put to my legal defense.
[03:35:45.673 --> 03:35:47.394]  I met with a very high-powered
[03:35:48.115 --> 03:35:56.397]  Criminal defense attorney last week, who I would like to retain, and he told me my defense will cost a minimum of two million dollars.
[03:35:56.537 --> 03:35:57.258]  A minimum.
[03:35:57.578 --> 03:36:02.499]  So I have a lawsuit against me by the Democratic National Committee.
[03:36:03.039 --> 03:36:11.502]  Me, Donald Trump Jr., the Trump campaign, Vladimir Putin, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, the Republican National Committee.
[03:36:12.082 --> 03:36:12.642]  It's a farce.
[03:36:13.702 --> 03:36:19.269]  I have the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating me.
[03:36:19.890 --> 03:36:29.282]  I have Robert Mueller in his gumshoes, poking into every nook and cranny of my life, interviewing people who work for me, asking questions like,
[03:36:30.489 --> 03:36:31.830]  How's his relationship with his wife?
[03:36:32.250 --> 03:36:33.330]  How's he along with his kids?
[03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:34.871]  Where's his money come from?
[03:36:35.171 --> 03:36:36.471]  Does he smoke marijuana?
[03:36:36.992 --> 03:36:37.812]  Have you seen him drunk?
[03:36:37.832 --> 03:36:38.612]  Does he drink a lot?
[03:36:39.353 --> 03:36:40.273]  Does he have girlfriends?
[03:36:40.293 --> 03:36:41.233]  Does he have boyfriends?
[03:36:42.034 --> 03:36:43.634]  What's his social life like?
[03:36:43.914 --> 03:36:46.896]  I mean, it has nothing to do with Russian collusion!
[03:36:47.236 --> 03:36:58.140]  And they have unlimited federal money to come after you, but now you have to go into debt, essentially, to defend yourself against charges that are completely bogus to begin with.
[03:36:58.240 --> 03:36:59.280]  Just to prove your innocence!
[03:36:59.420 --> 03:37:08.803]  I had set aside a small amount of money, which is almost all derived from my book sales, I've written five books, that was supposed to pay for my grandchildren's college education.
[03:37:09.383 --> 03:37:12.264]  I've had no choice but to liquidate it and use it to pay for lawyers.
[03:37:13.064 --> 03:37:21.167]  They seek to destroy me financially, which is why I ask people to go to stonedefensefund.com and send a generous contribution.
[03:37:21.607 --> 03:37:24.108]  I have no choice but to turn to my friends and supporters.
[03:37:24.608 --> 03:37:25.408]  I am not wealthy.
[03:37:25.988 --> 03:37:28.710]  And Robert Mueller has a big old target on my back.
[03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:33.534]  Now, he's having trouble finding evidence of a crime because there is no crime.
[03:37:34.595 --> 03:37:38.539]  And he doesn't like it when you expose what he's doing, but trust me, I will do that.
[03:37:38.979 --> 03:37:42.122]  Because people need to know about the abuses of this process.
[03:37:42.862 --> 03:37:47.927]  In the grand jury, when people who are associated with me are asked questions and they don't like the answer, they cut them off.
[03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:59.740]  It's an abusive process, but for the prosecutors to think that they will not be named, and that their own ethical problems will not be brought to the fore, then they don't understand this process at all.
[03:38:00.020 --> 03:38:07.747]  The reason this is so disturbing, I think, to a typical person hearing this is that this same kind of strategy could be run against anyone.
[03:38:08.087 --> 03:38:12.871]  If you are targeted and selected by the deep state, they can make your life a living hell.
[03:38:13.152 --> 03:38:14.172]  They can bankrupt you.
[03:38:14.453 --> 03:38:16.895]  They can force you to sell assets, to sell a house.
[03:38:16.915 --> 03:38:18.937]  I mean, look what they did to General Flynn.
[03:38:19.057 --> 03:38:20.258]  A great patriot.
[03:38:20.338 --> 03:38:20.818]  Exactly.
[03:38:21.139 --> 03:38:25.683]  They can destroy your life, but they are backed by an unlimited federal government
[03:38:26.463 --> 03:38:31.570]  With unlimited budget that they confiscate from the taxpayers and of course Democrats want them to take even more.
[03:38:32.369 --> 03:38:40.634]  And I think that the feeling out there, I mean, I feel this too, that if they come after you, they could come after me or anyone else for any reason.
[03:38:41.355 --> 03:38:49.760]  Well, just like the censorship blitzkrieg against Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:38:50.401 --> 03:38:51.802]  He's just the test case.
[03:38:52.542 --> 03:38:58.326]  If they are successful in silencing Alex Jones and shutting down InfoWars, and that's exactly what they have in mind,
[03:38:59.738 --> 03:39:00.299]  Who's next?
[03:39:00.639 --> 03:39:01.259]  Sean Hannity?
[03:39:01.820 --> 03:39:02.621]  Tucker Carlson?
[03:39:03.301 --> 03:39:04.042]  Laura Ingraham?
[03:39:04.562 --> 03:39:05.303]  Mike Savage?
[03:39:05.744 --> 03:39:06.584]  Rush Limbaugh?
[03:39:06.764 --> 03:39:11.329]  All these patriots that I revere, they need to understand that they are next on the hit list.
[03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:14.171]  Alex Jones is merely the test case.
[03:39:14.552 --> 03:39:16.553]  And what's being done to him is outrageous.
[03:39:16.633 --> 03:39:23.520]  And now, Mike, it's absolutely clear, we can't say this enough times, this is what the mob would call a setup.
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:24.321]  Yes, yes.
[03:39:24.361 --> 03:39:33.389]  You get out front and you say, Jones is advocating violence against the media, then someone in the media will be attacked or hurt or killed, and then they will say, Jones did it!
[03:39:33.489 --> 03:39:34.410]  It was Jones who did it!
[03:39:34.430 --> 03:39:35.331]  Right, right.
[03:39:35.491 --> 03:39:36.372]  It's a lie.
[03:39:36.592 --> 03:39:38.253]  It is a vicious lie.
[03:39:38.414 --> 03:39:39.435]  It is a smear.
[03:39:39.775 --> 03:39:46.201]  So we cannot be clear here, let's say it one more time, we renounce violence against members of the media or anyone else.
[03:39:46.541 --> 03:39:47.962]  Violence is counterproductive.
[03:39:47.982 --> 03:39:49.204]  It is not what we believe in.
[03:39:49.744 --> 03:39:55.969]  And if there is violence, it will be a false flag that is falsely blamed on Alex Jones and the people here at InfoWars.
[03:39:56.009 --> 03:39:57.811]  What does the President need to do right now?
[03:39:57.891 --> 03:40:05.578]  I mean, if you were to say to President Trump, and you've known him for a very long time and had many conversations with him, if he were here right now,
[03:40:06.767 --> 03:40:06.987]  What?
[03:40:07.588 --> 03:40:18.060]  I mean, we would have to appeal to... Call up your Deputy Attorney General for Antitrust and tell him to bring an immediate action against Facebook, Twitter, etc.
[03:40:18.140 --> 03:40:18.660]  etc.
[03:40:18.880 --> 03:40:21.343]  for monopolistic and antitrust practices.
[03:40:21.483 --> 03:40:21.624]  Yes.
[03:40:21.764 --> 03:40:23.225]  And that would end this censorship.
[03:40:23.265 --> 03:40:25.648]  That's the fastest and cleanest way to do it.
[03:40:25.748 --> 03:40:27.389]  What about the Mueller investigation?
[03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:37.075]  He should terminate Mr. Mueller, who has his own problems regarding 9-11, the Anthrax investigation, Uranium One, the Whitey Bulger matter.
[03:40:37.355 --> 03:40:39.196]  He's got quite a colorful past.
[03:40:39.276 --> 03:40:42.298]  If he thinks that they're putting me on trial and we're not going to talk about
[03:40:42.398 --> 03:40:42.598]  Well, uh...
[03:41:12.478 --> 03:41:20.685]  And I would add to the president that those actions, if he took them, would probably set off massive left-wing violent riots across America.
[03:41:20.785 --> 03:41:23.007]  I would add that we the people have your back.
[03:41:23.628 --> 03:41:25.970]  We the people will help stop the violence.
[03:41:26.010 --> 03:41:29.873]  We will help support lawfulness and civility in society.
[03:41:30.193 --> 03:41:34.097]  If the left wants to start a 25-city riot and try to burn down this country, guess what?
[03:41:34.477 --> 03:41:38.040]  We're going to stop them from a defensive posture, not an aggressive posture.
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:39.361]  We do not start violence.
[03:41:39.741 --> 03:41:42.944]  We help defend our nation and end violence and lawlessness.
[03:41:43.064 --> 03:41:45.766]  I do think that the president has the support of our military.
[03:41:46.146 --> 03:41:49.649]  I do think the president has the support of our men and women in uniform.
[03:41:50.529 --> 03:41:55.934]  And I think if there is illegal, unlawful violence, the president has the authority to stop it.
[03:41:56.334 --> 03:41:58.416]  But that is precisely what they have in mind.
[03:41:59.257 --> 03:42:02.185]  We don't start problems, but we will defend ourselves.
[03:42:02.285 --> 03:42:03.368]  I think that's the key message.
[03:42:07.202 --> 03:42:15.106]  I mean, if some of those actions are taken, wouldn't we have to declare martial law at some level in order to stop the left-wing riots and violence?
[03:42:15.346 --> 03:42:18.248]  Oh boy, that is a slippery slope.
[03:42:18.288 --> 03:42:19.488]  That really disturbs me.
[03:42:19.548 --> 03:42:23.691]  Look, I understand the dynamic around President Trump.
[03:42:24.191 --> 03:42:25.932]  I saw this when I worked for Ronald Reagan.
[03:42:26.592 --> 03:42:30.814]  When we elect an outsider president, first they try to defeat you.
[03:42:31.194 --> 03:42:35.977]  When they can't defeat you, they try to co-opt you, and that's precisely what's going on today.
[03:42:36.383 --> 03:42:38.265]  All right, we'll be back with Roger Stone.
[03:42:38.545 --> 03:42:41.669]  This is Mike Adams, also co-hosting here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:41.689 --> 03:42:44.172]  A lot of breaking analysis right here.
[03:42:44.232 --> 03:42:45.653]  There's more straight ahead.
[03:42:46.054 --> 03:42:46.654]  Stay with us.
[03:42:47.115 --> 03:42:48.817]  Everything is at stake right now in America.
[03:42:48.877 --> 03:42:50.679]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:50.799 --> 03:42:51.240]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:01.235 --> 03:43:05.057]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:05.357 --> 03:43:12.000]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:17.042]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:43:17.322 --> 03:43:24.225]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[03:43:24.665 --> 03:43:30.352]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:43:30.712 --> 03:43:39.903]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:43:40.343 --> 03:43:47.470]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:43:47.831 --> 03:44:00.664]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[03:44:01.443 --> 03:44:05.907]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[03:44:06.027 --> 03:44:14.315]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[03:44:14.395 --> 03:44:16.017]  But, here's what you want to know.
[03:44:16.988 --> 03:44:22.951]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:44:23.611 --> 03:44:27.152]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:44:28.033 --> 03:44:36.036]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:44:36.616 --> 03:44:44.280]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[03:44:45.080 --> 03:44:48.843]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[03:44:49.424 --> 03:44:50.204]  It's Alpha Power.
[03:44:50.264 --> 03:44:53.367]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[03:44:54.455 --> 03:45:15.164]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes, and so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[03:45:15.404 --> 03:45:16.945]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you
[03:45:17.245 --> 03:45:18.586]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[03:45:18.606 --> 03:45:20.788]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with all the power.
[03:45:20.988 --> 03:45:23.190]  Because I said, I want to dominate the industry.
[03:45:23.730 --> 03:45:28.054]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[03:45:28.074 --> 03:45:29.415]  I'm going to explain this, because this is critical.
[03:45:30.216 --> 03:45:37.461]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[03:45:37.481 --> 03:45:38.903]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[03:45:39.483 --> 03:45:41.064]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[03:45:41.084 --> 03:45:42.205]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[03:45:42.265 --> 03:45:43.907]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[03:45:46.809 --> 03:45:47.650]  But here's an example.
[03:45:48.490 --> 03:45:56.076]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:45:56.096 --> 03:45:57.797]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:45:58.278 --> 03:46:04.443]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[03:46:05.143 --> 03:46:10.224]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:46:10.504 --> 03:46:18.846]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting fifteen, twenty dollars, thirty dollars, forty dollars, depending on the product, in them.
[03:46:19.246 --> 03:46:20.266]  Nobody else does that.
[03:46:20.346 --> 03:46:23.067]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:46:23.547 --> 03:46:33.309]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in
[03:46:33.629 --> 03:46:39.753]  Quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[03:46:40.093 --> 03:46:47.899]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the globalists.
[03:46:48.199 --> 03:46:49.060]  A 360 win.
[03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:51.441]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:46:51.821 --> 03:46:57.105]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:46:57.125 --> 03:46:57.525]  A total 360 win.
[03:47:04.838 --> 03:47:09.341]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.784 --> 03:47:19.329]  We're not going to make America great again.
[03:47:19.789 --> 03:47:21.090]  It was never that great.
[03:47:38.007 --> 03:47:40.849]  We have not reached greatness.
[03:47:42.190 --> 03:47:49.475]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[03:47:50.175 --> 03:47:58.381]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population, is gone.
[03:48:03.404 --> 03:48:05.625]  Wow, I marvel at that.
[03:48:06.625 --> 03:48:09.986]  Perhaps that's Andrew Cuomo's campaign slogan for 2020.
[03:48:10.446 --> 03:48:14.307]  We can't make America great again because it was never that great to begin with.
[03:48:14.847 --> 03:48:16.047]  Wow, unbelievable.
[03:48:16.227 --> 03:48:17.447]  Let's see how voters like that.
[03:48:18.007 --> 03:48:21.248]  Some breaking news for those of you who missed it this morning.
[03:48:21.348 --> 03:48:24.709]  I'm here with Mike Adams, Roger Stone on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:25.449 --> 03:48:33.894]  I'm sure many of you saw the reports this morning that the FCC had shut down Alex Jones' flagship radio station.
[03:48:34.434 --> 03:48:36.215]  This was reported by The Hill.
[03:48:36.715 --> 03:48:39.937]  We can show the original story here on the SkyCam.
[03:48:40.577 --> 03:48:44.940]  Here is the correction just recently issued by The Hill.
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:46.780]  We now know the truth.
[03:48:46.820 --> 03:48:56.683]  The FCC targeted a small pirate radio station here in Austin that broadcast the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:57.123 --> 03:48:59.183]  Hardly our flagship station.
[03:48:59.223 --> 03:49:04.345]  In fact, I don't think this station that they refer to has been on the air for over a year.
[03:49:04.945 --> 03:49:10.906]  And the fines referred to in the first story were over a year ago.
[03:49:11.066 --> 03:49:13.927]  So, we have some correction there, Mike, to the fake news.
[03:49:14.127 --> 03:49:15.229]  This is extraordinary.
[03:49:15.969 --> 03:49:21.877]  Of course, kudos to The Hill for correcting the story, but they deserve blame for running the fake story in the first place.
[03:49:22.218 --> 03:49:25.041]  And by the way, most of the other media will never correct the story.
[03:49:25.282 --> 03:49:27.004]  And this brings up the most important point here.
[03:49:27.365 --> 03:49:30.429]  They are faking the news every day against Alex Jones.
[03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:31.370]  They are faking it.
[03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:32.731]  They are making it up.
[03:49:32.791 --> 03:49:34.112]  They are lying deliberately.
[03:49:34.152 --> 03:49:34.973]  These are not mistakes.
[03:49:35.433 --> 03:49:41.718]  These are deliberate, engineered, scripted lies and word games to try to blame Alex Jones and blame InfoWars.
[03:49:42.158 --> 03:49:47.002]  And the purpose of that, as you know, Roger, is because a false flag is coming.
[03:49:47.262 --> 03:49:48.883]  Go to InfoWars.com right now.
[03:49:48.923 --> 03:49:52.566]  There's an emergency video on the homepage of the website.
[03:49:52.626 --> 03:49:53.807]  A false flag is coming.
[03:49:54.147 --> 03:49:57.390]  And we know, because we've seen the playbook, we've seen history, all of us,
[03:49:57.870 --> 03:50:02.795]  We know that this false flag is being engineered to blame Alex Jones.
[03:50:03.136 --> 03:50:07.480]  To make him the fall guy for whatever violence is going to be carried out.
[03:50:07.561 --> 03:50:10.083]  It is so obvious, Roger, that this is coming.
[03:50:10.123 --> 03:50:11.865]  The playbook is right out in the open.
[03:50:12.065 --> 03:50:14.268]  Do they think we're that stupid that we don't see this coming?
[03:50:14.528 --> 03:50:19.210]  You just said that, you know, you had the best phrase yet, fall guy, exactly right.
[03:50:19.571 --> 03:50:23.012]  This is an attempt to blame Jones for something he has nothing to do with.
[03:50:23.673 --> 03:50:26.654]  I have seen the willful distortions of what he actually said.
[03:50:27.054 --> 03:50:33.718]  Last night on text I went back and forth with somebody at CNN, very high up at CNN, with whom I have a good relationship.
[03:50:34.458 --> 03:50:41.362]  About Sandy Hook because Alex Jones has never said the things about Sandy Hook that are ascribed to him They're taken out of context.
[03:50:41.642 --> 03:50:56.409]  They're taken partially But it is as soon as you bring up his name left-wingers scream Sandy Hook Sandy Hook Like it's almost It's it's really like a visceral ingrained
[03:50:58.424 --> 03:50:59.525]  Piece of falsehood, I guess.
[03:50:59.545 --> 03:51:00.345]  There's no other way to put it.
[03:51:00.766 --> 03:51:11.233]  It's like a rambling mound of zombies have been programmed with microchips to spout Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook, and attack Alex Jones on the street.
[03:51:11.273 --> 03:51:12.814]  I mean, it really is insane.
[03:51:12.854 --> 03:51:19.818]  It's like we're living through The Walking Dead, but they have voices and they are spouting nonsense.
[03:51:19.838 --> 03:51:23.140]  But, you know, a little bit of satire there on that part.
[03:51:23.181 --> 03:51:24.321]  But this is real.
[03:51:24.421 --> 03:51:27.343]  This false flag that's coming is real.
[03:51:27.503 --> 03:51:28.384]  I'm convinced of it.
[03:51:28.624 --> 03:51:36.633]  No, and you heard about it here, folks, so go back, you'll be able to go back and look at this video later when it is revealed that everything we predict comes to pass.
[03:51:36.794 --> 03:51:38.335]  Let's say today's date.
[03:51:38.456 --> 03:51:39.717]  What is the date today?
[03:51:39.737 --> 03:51:40.618]  I think it's the 16th.
[03:51:40.758 --> 03:51:42.380]  August 16th, 2018.
[03:51:42.761 --> 03:51:44.983]  Roger Stone, Mike Adams on the record.
[03:51:45.424 --> 03:51:47.146]  Today, what other event happened?
[03:51:47.206 --> 03:51:47.987]  Aretha Franklin.
[03:51:48.527 --> 03:51:49.467]  She passed away.
[03:51:49.788 --> 03:51:51.648]  God bless Aretha Franklin, by the way.
[03:51:52.288 --> 03:51:53.289]  Prayers to her family.
[03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:54.769]  But that's what's happening today.
[03:51:55.170 --> 03:51:56.670]  We know this false flag is coming.
[03:51:56.710 --> 03:52:08.855]  We are on the record saying that they're going to try to blame Alex Jones and take down his voice and his infrastructure, his entire operation, by killing people, the globalists or the deep state or whoever's running it.
[03:52:10.047 --> 03:52:14.471]  I mean, Roger, I can't even believe that this is happening in America.
[03:52:14.872 --> 03:52:16.233]  This is not the America that I know.
[03:52:16.973 --> 03:52:27.143]  It is hard to believe the blatant disregard for the Constitution, the fact that the Trump Justice Department is still under the total control of Barack Obama.
[03:52:27.703 --> 03:52:35.029]  That because of either the mental feebleness or the fact that he's compromised, Jeff Sessions is not running the Justice Department.
[03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:41.775]  We have a rogue Justice Department run by Rod Rosenstein, by the way, who cleared Manafort personally as the U.S.
[03:52:41.815 --> 03:52:45.919]  Attorney of all these crimes that he's on trial for almost 10 years ago.
[03:52:45.939 --> 03:52:46.319]  Amazing.
[03:52:46.399 --> 03:52:48.081]  Little kind of side factoid there.
[03:52:49.902 --> 03:52:55.927]  It is vitally important that people ask me every day, how can we change this?
[03:52:56.527 --> 03:52:57.908]  What is the president going to do?
[03:52:58.409 --> 03:53:06.355]  He needs to fire Rod Rosenstein, he needs to terminate Mr. Sessions, and he needs to close down the witch hunt.
[03:53:06.675 --> 03:53:11.739]  This is an inquisition in which Robert Mueller is playing the role of Torkmata.
[03:53:12.179 --> 03:53:21.524]  And Roger, while these prosecutions or attempted prosecutions are going on, these secret investigations that are corrupted and illegal, look at what's not being investigated.
[03:53:22.024 --> 03:53:23.805]  Where is Lock Her Up?
[03:53:24.366 --> 03:53:26.707]  Where are the investigations into the Clinton Foundation?
[03:53:26.727 --> 03:53:30.329]  What about Barack Obama funneling money to Iran to build nuclear weapons?
[03:53:30.909 --> 03:53:34.211]  Money laundering on an international scale, cargo planes full of cash.
[03:53:34.511 --> 03:53:35.472]  No, that's the irony.
[03:53:35.532 --> 03:53:37.714]  People keep yelling at me, you're a traitor, you're a traitor.
[03:53:37.754 --> 03:53:46.442]  No, the traitors are Barack Obama selling weapons to ISIS, Bill Clinton selling missile guidance technology to the Chinese.
[03:53:46.722 --> 03:53:48.543]  They are the criminals.
[03:53:48.964 --> 03:53:56.751]  And until we get an honest Justice Department, until we have a real Attorney General committed to the rule of law, this is never going to get corrected.
[03:53:56.811 --> 03:54:00.354]  The uranium supply to Russia-linked companies, as well.
[03:54:00.434 --> 03:54:01.455]  Uranium One scandal.
[03:54:01.855 --> 03:54:03.316]  Robert Mueller was involved in that.
[03:54:03.556 --> 03:54:07.800]  Where's the investigation of James Comey leaking classified information?
[03:54:08.040 --> 03:54:09.961]  Where's the investigation of Hillary's email server?
[03:54:10.242 --> 03:54:14.044]  Yeah, there's a double standard here that I think the American people are finally onto.
[03:54:14.905 --> 03:54:26.834]  That rules and laws are only for Trump supporters, and that members of the deep state and the two-party duopoly that have virtually ruined this country are allowed to operate with impunity against the law.
[03:54:27.175 --> 03:54:31.198]  Folks, I want to take this opportunity to remind you once again that freedom isn't free.
[03:54:32.078 --> 03:54:38.983]  And we survive here, we thrive here at InfoWars only because of your loyal patronage at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:54:39.464 --> 03:54:50.111]  We have some extraordinary specials now, but every penny that you spend, Alex Jones pumps right back into expanding and improving what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:54:50.492 --> 03:54:52.633]  Whether it is Brain Force Plus at 40% off,
[03:54:54.034 --> 03:54:59.456]  Or Super Male Vitality, the special Mike Zimmerman formula at 50% off.
[03:54:59.916 --> 03:55:02.377]  Secret 12 at 40% off.
[03:55:02.997 --> 03:55:05.878]  DNN Force Plus at 50% off.
[03:55:06.499 --> 03:55:13.942]  Survival Shield, in my opinion, the very best natural iodine you can find on the marketplace today at 40% off.
[03:55:15.522 --> 03:55:24.969]  Your purchase of these products is the only thing that keeps InfoWars thriving, surviving, expanding, and fighting.
[03:55:25.710 --> 03:55:28.332]  Without your support, we are nothing.
[03:55:28.752 --> 03:55:33.056]  We have no big multinational corporations underwriting our broadcasting here.
[03:55:33.396 --> 03:55:37.479]  We have no angels, no fat cats who support what we do.
[03:55:37.819 --> 03:55:39.120]  We work for every penny.
[03:55:39.521 --> 03:55:44.865]  Alex Jones pumps it right back into InfoWars to improve what we do here every day.
[03:55:45.405 --> 03:55:45.945]  It really is.
[03:55:46.005 --> 03:55:46.906]  This is real grassroots.
[03:55:46.986 --> 03:55:49.687]  And we need your support as never before.
[03:55:50.167 --> 03:55:56.509]  Jones has to bear the costs of these multi-million dollar lawsuits against him, all of them baseless.
[03:55:56.930 --> 03:56:01.852]  He has to fight against the war of censorship in which they seek to close us down across the board.
[03:56:02.292 --> 03:56:06.393]  He has to fight against the vicious defamation of the mainstream media.
[03:56:06.753 --> 03:56:10.155]  We need your support at the Infowars store now as never before.
[03:56:10.755 --> 03:56:15.877]  And, while you're there, get your copy of Stone's Rules, my new book.
[03:56:16.157 --> 03:56:26.280]  We have a special running where if you buy it through the Infowars.com store and you mail it to me, I will gladly personalize it, sign it, and mail it back to you.
[03:56:26.300 --> 03:56:31.562]  A special offer for Infowarriors and those who buy it at the Infowars site only.
[03:56:32.002 --> 03:56:35.803]  So, please, go to the store now and give us your patronage.
[03:56:36.123 --> 03:56:38.304]  We need your support as never before.
[03:56:38.424 --> 03:56:45.166]  I just want to say, Roger, as we close out the last minute of today's broadcast, when I woke up this morning, I had no idea that I was going to be co-hosting with you.
[03:56:45.266 --> 03:56:53.229]  It's an honor to be here with you and just to share these moments and our shared outrage at what's happening to America.
[03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:55.849]  And I know you are a patriot, as I am a patriot.
[03:56:56.310 --> 03:57:06.693]  We are both fighting, sometimes together here at the same time, sometimes independently, but we need your support and we are here to continue this fight for your freedom and your country and your
[03:57:07.493 --> 03:57:16.337]  Media infrastructure that represents your views, your freedoms, not the mainstream media corporate sellout that's all pro-Big Pharma and all that garbage.
[03:57:17.298 --> 03:57:19.119]  Roger, it's been an honor being here with you today.
[03:57:19.159 --> 03:57:19.939]  Great to be with you.
[03:57:19.999 --> 03:57:22.821]  Folks, there's a false flag attack on the media coming.
[03:57:23.301 --> 03:57:25.942]  They're going to seek to blame it on Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:57:25.982 --> 03:57:27.323]  Don't buy that BS.
[03:57:27.703 --> 03:57:29.044]  You heard it here first.
[03:57:29.264 --> 03:57:29.944]  Watch the video.
[03:57:30.324 --> 03:57:31.025]  Share the video.
[03:57:31.145 --> 03:57:32.225]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:32.265 --> 03:57:33.126]  More videos are coming.
[03:57:33.886 --> 03:57:43.833]  So just share, tweet them out, post them everywhere, and people like Roger, myself, Alex Jones, and many others, we're going to continue to fight for your right to exist in a free society.
[03:57:44.653 --> 03:57:45.554]  Thank you for joining us today.
[03:57:50.817 --> 03:57:55.200]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[03:57:56.241 --> 03:58:00.804]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[03:58:02.811 --> 03:58:05.893]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[03:58:06.773 --> 03:58:08.534]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[03:58:12.397 --> 03:58:16.899]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[03:58:17.140 --> 03:58:21.682]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[03:58:21.962 --> 03:58:26.025]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[03:58:29.141 --> 03:58:33.022]  Getting a good picture of everybody so we look nice and handsome and thin.
[03:58:33.062 --> 03:58:33.422]  Beautiful.
[03:58:33.582 --> 03:58:34.123]  Perfect.
[03:58:37.484 --> 03:58:40.965]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[03:58:40.985 --> 03:58:45.106]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[03:58:45.286 --> 03:58:50.147]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[03:58:50.788 --> 03:58:51.988]  He's not a politician.
[03:58:52.808 --> 03:58:53.509]  He's one of us.
[03:58:55.989 --> 03:58:58.110]  Never, ever, ever give up.
