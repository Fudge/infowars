[00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.974]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.242]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday Global Broadcast.
[00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:17.407]  You're going to get my exclusive breakdown with huge new developments coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:24.452]  My official response to the big tech giant war, not just on my free speech, but your free speech.
[00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:33.219]  We have scores of top Democrats openly calling for Fox News to now be deplatformed and all conservative news information to be removed off of Facebook.
[00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.381]  And a new secret Democrat plan has been leaked to Reason Magazine.
[00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:39.063]  Planning to do it before the election.
[00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:40.043]  We knew it was coming.
[00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:41.323]  I'm the test case.
[00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:42.624]  Everyone's been warned.
[00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:46.085]  But first, here's part of an emergency report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.807]  We'll come back with another report where I boil down the China connection.
[00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:53.068]  And then I'm going to give you, live on air, my analysis.
[00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:53.448]  Stay with us.
[00:00:54.326 --> 00:01:06.775]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube all completely banned InfoWars within 12 hours of each other, clearly suggesting big tech collusion and proving their terms of service are all bull****.
[00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.637]  This is political censorship.
[00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:10.098]  This is the Purge.
[00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:14.721]  Facebook cited language used to describe Muslims, transgenders, and immigrants.
[00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:19.525]  They provided zero specific examples as to what we said that was verboten.
[00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:22.167]  And neither did Apple, Spotify, or YouTube.
[00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:25.350]  But they're private companies, they can ban who they like!
[00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.850]  No!
[00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.954]  Facebook, Twitter and Google have monopolized free speech online.
[00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:31.195]  They're a monopoly.
[00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.439]  They're also working directly with institutions of media.
[00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.287]  CNN whines all day about Trump threatening press freedoms, while simultaneously lobbying to have its competitors shut down by big tech.
[00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:46.430]  America's free press supports censorship.
[00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.572]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:52.673]  Typically a channel gets three strikes and then we terminate the channel.
[00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:11.483]  And they did.
[00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:34.419]  You saw this.
[00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:35.599]  You were at USA Today.
[00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.460]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.240]  And I also saw the system corrected.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.921]  As WikiLeaks tweeted, this is a global antitrust problem.
[00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.442]  This is cultural imperialism.
[00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:48.302]  So no, it's not just a private company.
[00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:57.164]  This is a handful of far-left hysterics in San Francisco framing legitimate criticism of mass immigration and Islam as hate speech.
[00:02:57.164 --> 00:02:58.825]  This is language policing.
[00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.625]  This is political censorship.
[00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:04.567]  They know Infowars played a key role in electing Trump.
[00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.809]  This is punishment for that.
[00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.091]  And this all happened three months before the midterms.
[00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.892]  This is election meddling.
[00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.613]  This is election rigging.
[00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:15.094]  This was all coordinated.
[00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.937]  They all banned Infowars within the same 12-hour period.
[00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:20.918]  That's big tech collusion.
[00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:23.299]  That's a total abuse of power.
[00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.061]  Now look at Apple's excuse for banning Infowars.
[00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:30.264]  According to Apple, if you don't respect people with different opinions,
[00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:31.644]  You will be banned!
[00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:38.126]  Does this mean it's necessary to respect people who advocate child marriage and honor killings just to have a platform?
[00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.367]  Because I don't respect those people.
[00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:46.269]  I don't respect people like Louis Farrakhan, who praised Adolf Hitler as, quote, a very great man.
[00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.431]  Presumably, Apple does, because his app and his broadcasts are still available on their platform.
[00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:56.992]  I don't respect Antifa, a group that violently attacks innocent people.
[00:03:56.992 --> 00:03:59.493]  But Antifa's pages, podcasts and videos
[00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:03.054]  ...are rarely, if ever, banned on any platform.
[00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:04.355]  Now look at Wikipedia.
[00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:10.717]  Activist editors removing Sarah Jeong's racist tweet controversy from her Wikipedia page.
[00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:16.160]  Literally throwing the most important event in her career down an Orwellian memory hole.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.161]  Literally attempting to change reality and hide history.
[00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:21.442]  That's what this is all about.
[00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:26.924]  And all you liberals orgasmically celebrating big business censoring independent media.
[00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:30.285]  You're not liberals, you're authoritarians.
[00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:32.845]  Whether you hate Alex Jones is beside the point.
[00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:39.267]  Do you love the fact that a handful of tech monopolists have the power to simultaneously purge him from the internet?
[00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:40.807]  Forget the Supreme Court.
[00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:46.189]  Susan Wojcicki and Mark Zuckerberg are now de facto defining the plurality... Alright, folks!
[00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.251]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:52.036]  That full report is called The Purge.
[00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:55.300]  And it's on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.682]  Battle the globalist censors.
[00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:59.967]  Spread the live links from InfoWars.com forward slash news.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.861]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:08.644]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:16.600]  It's Tuesday, the 7th day of August 2018.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.444]  Coming up in the next segment...
[00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:21.330]  Go to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.351]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:32.919]  We had yesterday the image of the Chinese Apple computer logo merged and had it on the front page of the Drudge Report saying that's going to be the big news.
[00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.922]  That China is running the censorship here in America.
[00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:40.986]  Well, look what happens if you go to DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:06:40.986 --> 00:06:42.828]  We'll punch that up on screen.
[00:06:42.828 --> 00:06:46.170]  Boom!
[00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.350]  Now,
[00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:54.180]  If you continue and expand on that, what did we have up yesterday?
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:09.225]  We said, Drudge is dead on target with Apple quarterbacking the censorship operations, but we pointed out who's really in control of Apple because Apple officially became state-run by China and admitted it to Reuters four months ago.
[00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:12.186]  Let's go back to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:16.167]  The news I have is so big
[00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:23.400]  And so confirmed that I'm not even ready to go on air right now.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.765]  So I'm going to go to a special report I shot yesterday, boiling down the China Internet takeover connection.
[00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:33.868]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to try to come back then and be ready.
[00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:35.169]  And it's not for lack of research.
[00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:36.811]  I have too much.
[00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:39.513]  We have exactly what they're doing.
[00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:40.734]  We knew it.
[00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:41.775]  We predicted it all.
[00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.236]  We have the sources.
[00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:43.856]  But here's the deal.
[00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:46.539]  And I'm getting lightning bolt chills right now.
[00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:55.356]  That's why the enemy gets chills, because if people realize what we're saying right now, it's done for the New World Order.
[00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:58.217]  It's done for the Communist Chinese and this whole system.
[00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:06.321]  So, we are in the zeitgeist right now, and I want to thank DrugsReport.com and others for being at the heart of defending the First Amendment.
[00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:10.343]  Now let me just show you these articles.
[00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:13.985]  You notice I said this in a special report yesterday you're about to see, and now,
[00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:18.924]  It's happened, but it had already happened.
[00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:35.369]  Dem Senator demands more censorship of conservative media, demands all conservatives be taken off of the internet, says that Infowars is the stinking tip of the iceberg, and they call for Fox News, talk radio, everything to be removed.
[00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.330]  Go read it!
[00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.892]  Now, that's him in Twitter.
[00:08:42.892 --> 00:08:43.352]  Look at this.
[00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:50.592]  Now that Facebook, YouTube, and Apple have come for Alex Jones, now they will start coming after the rest of us.
[00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:53.453]  Michael Snyder, absolutely right, but here it is.
[00:08:53.453 --> 00:08:56.874]  Mid-term meddling Facebook blocks Republican candidate ad.
[00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:59.416]  It's happening every two minutes I see a new article like this.
[00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:01.476]  And here's the key from Reason.
[00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:04.598]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans, secretly.
[00:09:04.598 --> 00:09:07.639]  Reason got a copy for government takeover of the Internet.
[00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.840]  By them.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.221]  Calling everyone Russian agents.
[00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:20.123]  They have a Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reporter that basically has a bunch of reporters after me in Austin.
[00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:26.364]  And when I talked to one, she looked right at me and she said, tell me how you work for RT and how much money they pay you.
[00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:27.745]  And I said, I've never worked for RT.
[00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:28.865]  I've never been paid any money by them.
[00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:31.486]  I haven't been on their thing in like four years.
[00:09:31.486 --> 00:09:34.106]  I guess except for Max Keiser a few times.
[00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:38.087]  And she looked at me and said, uh-huh, oh yeah, right, right.
[00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:40.268]  These people are out of their minds.
[00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:43.018]  The crackdown continues.
[00:09:43.018 --> 00:09:48.824]  Twitter suspends everyone running the Ron Paul Institute, because you gotta shut that evil guy down.
[00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:50.746]  Tommy Robinson banned from Instagram.
[00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:54.090]  Oh, by the way, that's the big news here.
[00:09:54.090 --> 00:10:00.296]  It's why my head's spinning right now.
[00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:04.100]  There was the Huffington Post last night going, Alex Jones is still on Instagram.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.062]  And he's still on iTunes, and he's still on Droid.
[00:10:09.062 --> 00:10:10.443]  And he needs to be removed.
[00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.465]  And Instagram clicked its heels and went, yes sir!
[00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:23.410]  And took us down photos of me riding a horse, photos of my family, funny memes, and they just repeated what the media said.
[00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.112]  Islamophobia, transphobia, bullying children.
[00:10:27.112 --> 00:10:31.754]  By the way, right as they banned us on YouTube yesterday, we happened to have our console open.
[00:10:31.754 --> 00:10:32.755]  We got a photo of it.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.621]  We tried to screenshot it, but by then it was gone.
[00:10:35.621 --> 00:10:41.303]  Our account was in good standing at YouTube, except for the Community Guidelines strike.
[00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:49.246]  So when they banned us, this is literally the minute they did, they never even said that we violated and got the other strikes.
[00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:50.226]  They just did it.
[00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:59.615]  Because the decision was made to circle the wagons after Patriots went into San Francisco and Portland this weekend, and Antifa tried to attack everybody.
[00:10:59.615 --> 00:11:11.778]  When they saw that we had the diverse crowd of Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and Whites, all loving each other and loving America, and coming together around freedom, they crapped their collective britches.
[00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:18.339]  Just as WikiLeaks said, the cultural imperialism of San Francisco wants to rule America.
[00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:20.060]  People talk about Harvard, they talk about
[00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:22.465]  New York culturally dominating?
[00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:22.925]  No, no, no.
[00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:35.673]  If you want to know what really dominates culture in the universities and in this country, it's San Francisco, which has adopted the Tavistock Institute British system of cultural engineering.
[00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:41.256]  And you've got CNN lobbying everywhere breathlessly, get Alex Jones off, get all his apps off.
[00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:44.098]  We just launched an app three weeks ago.
[00:11:44.098 --> 00:11:47.760]  It is now, if you go to the iTunes Store, number four.
[00:11:49.718 --> 00:11:49.858]  I'm
[00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:23.505]  Like them saying you can't buy an ad in the phone book, or you can't have a phone number, or breaking in during a phone call, which they can do now with digital controls if they want, they do it over the internet, and telling you sorry, you can't say that, you can't do that.
[00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:27.949]  It's beyond spying on you.
[00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:32.612]  It's censoring you in live time.
[00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:35.614]  Censoring you in live time.
[00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:37.936]  So we're going to break down who's behind it, what's happening, but now,
[00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:50.410]  It's in mainstream news that China runs Apple, and they're gonna use it for leverage against America.
[00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:57.415]  No wonder the Democrats are telling you about Russian spies hiding under every cabbage leaf.
[00:12:57.415 --> 00:13:01.778]  And, you know, hiding in their basements.
[00:13:01.778 --> 00:13:04.139]  Because people ask, how am I taking it?
[00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.361]  People ask, what's it like to be lied about everywhere?
[00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:08.082]  I'm an American patriot.
[00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:11.870]  I've been right about this.
[00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.011]  I've studied the globalists.
[00:13:13.011 --> 00:13:17.115]  I didn't sell out like most other people.
[00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:21.058]  Trump isn't a traitor either.
[00:13:21.058 --> 00:13:26.823]  They call him romantic because he believes the country is trying to restore it.
[00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:30.546]  So China announces we will not surrender.
[00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:33.189]  We are holding Apple hostage.
[00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:42.231]  Because Apple has 100% of its factories in China.
[00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:45.213]  Now they've announced a few are coming here.
[00:13:45.213 --> 00:13:49.575]  So the official government says, we have you now.
[00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.918]  China is like Darth Vader behind Luke Skywalker saying, stay in attack formation.
[00:13:53.918 --> 00:13:55.079]  I'm on the leader.
[00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:55.459]  Cover me.
[00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:59.198]  And he's right there going, I have you now.
[00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:07.404]  And at the last minute, like the Millennium Falcon, in comes Trump and the Liberty Movement and Infowars and blasts them out of the way so he can blow the Death Star.
[00:14:07.404 --> 00:14:12.408]  The problem is they'd already built another one around the corner and they just swung that bitch around.
[00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:14.590]  And this is it, baby!
[00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.493]  Toe to toe with the globalists and the chi-coms and the radical Islamists.
[00:14:18.493 --> 00:14:26.159]  I took my wife and children, took my girls, all three of my girls and my wife, to the Cheesecake Factory and lo and behold,
[00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:34.932]  In came people in full burqas.
[00:14:34.932 --> 00:14:37.796]  That means you're chattel slavery.
[00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:40.619]  That started in North Africa with sex slaves a thousand years ago.
[00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:43.122]  It wasn't even in Islam and popular until about 500 years ago.
[00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:50.318]  I'm going to come back and do the special report, breaking all this down, and then I'm going to come in with my official statement.
[00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:52.660]  It's just, it's got to be one hell of a speech from the heart.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.802]  I don't have notes, I just go off the research.
[00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:59.006]  I've got to get this together and just show you article after article during my statement.
[00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:00.467]  See, no one else does that.
[00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:05.311]  During my statement, everything is like a PowerPoint in live time, on radio and TV.
[00:15:05.311 --> 00:15:08.974]  So everything I say, I'm just going to lay on the table for the camera.
[00:15:13.258 --> 00:15:14.379]  Why do you think they moved?
[00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:15.460]  They miscalculated.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.041]  I told my dad two weeks ago.
[00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.603]  He said, why are you getting more aggressive on Aaron, baiting him?
[00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:21.565]  Why'd you say the Mueller thing?
[00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:23.906]  And I said, I'm pushing him.
[00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:27.749]  I'm pushing him to move early, instead of about a month before the election.
[00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:29.731]  I said, I think I'll be banned within a week and a half.
[00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:34.855]  Then they're going to move against everybody else and cause a landslide and a giant awakening.
[00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:37.136]  He said, I thought that's what you were planning.
[00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:41.380]  And now our operation is on all cylinders, accelerating to attack speed.
[00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:44.832]  So get ready!
[00:15:44.832 --> 00:15:49.475]  I told everyone about a year ago, from now on I follow my gut and it's never failed me.
[00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:53.378]  Now the globalists face my subconscious.
[00:15:53.378 --> 00:15:54.739]  I'm turning it loose.
[00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:56.600]  I'm doing what it wants in defense of liberty.
[00:15:59.622 --> 00:16:01.584]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:01.584 --> 00:16:06.889]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:08.491]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:16.839]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:22.545]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.526]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.788]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:31.192]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[00:20:02.887 --> 00:20:16.335]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:23.139]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.320]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.802]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:57.537 --> 00:20:58.858]  We knew it was coming.
[00:20:58.858 --> 00:21:00.279]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:14.132]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:14.873]  And then voila!
[00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:26.668]  Two weeks later, banned InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[00:21:26.668 --> 00:21:34.798]  CNN, MSNBC, the rest of the dying news system like the New York Times and the Washington Post, groups that are propped up by the Mexican Kingpin and the
[00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:35.378]  We're good.
[00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:57.889]  Mark Dice has more subscribers on his channel, he doesn't work for InfoWars, but he's an example of it, than CNN.
[00:21:57.889 --> 00:22:16.398]  And so their answer is, have CNN, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, and all these other corrupt organizations openly lobby for us to be removed, and then organize their listeners, their viewers, the different university organizations, Antifa, sleeping giants, and a bunch of other groups.
[00:22:17.418 --> 00:22:27.868]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:29.569]  You can't face your accuser.
[00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:34.554]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.242]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent, in their own words, for you.
[00:22:40.242 --> 00:22:49.866]  Nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[00:22:49.866 --> 00:22:54.928]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[00:22:54.928 --> 00:22:57.909]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:01.631]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[00:23:02.737 --> 00:23:03.598]  That of course is iTunes.
[00:23:32.637 --> 00:23:32.850]  We're good.
[00:23:33.815 --> 00:23:37.296]  And trying to make sure they can win back the House and try to impeach Trump.
[00:23:37.296 --> 00:23:38.636]  That's only one part of it.
[00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:57.561]  The bigger issue is they don't like Infowars exposing the fact in great detail that Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:59.221]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[00:23:59.221 --> 00:24:01.922]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[00:24:01.922 --> 00:24:03.002]  It's happening right now.
[00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:11.592]  And it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:16.078]  I've had a lot of top lawyers call me today and they say, Alex, we need to sue Apple.
[00:24:16.078 --> 00:24:17.700]  We need to sue all these groups.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.382]  They clearly are involved in cut and dry.
[00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:33.724]  Antitrust activities, working with other big corporations to delist you and block you from the marketplace of ideas so then when they demonize you, you don't have a way to respond to them and they can destroy you.
[00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:36.845]  And then with that model, move on against everybody else.
[00:24:38.072 --> 00:24:46.158]  Almost five months ago, the Wall Street Journal had the new CEO of News Corp brag that by 2019, the Internet will be basically paid.
[00:24:46.158 --> 00:24:52.602]  He said, Barry Dillard also said this as well, he owns Newsweek, so that's a Democrat on the other side, that the Internet will be paid soon.
[00:24:52.602 --> 00:24:59.367]  Watch, believe me, he said, because they're setting the precedent to de-platform InfoWars and Wikileaks as a test point example.
[00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:01.409]  And once they've done that, they're doing it to everybody.
[00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:02.769]  Now, what do we need to do?
[00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.791]  We need to call the White House.
[00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:06.012]  Go to Trump's rallies.
[00:25:06.012 --> 00:25:07.293]  Call the campaign.
[00:25:07.293 --> 00:25:15.639]  Let them know that this is about deplatforming conservatives and libertarians and other Republican candidates around the country to steal the election.
[00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:19.922]  It's true election meddling, not like the made-up Russia meddling garbage.
[00:25:19.922 --> 00:25:22.123]  This is out in the open and naked.
[00:25:22.123 --> 00:25:24.725]  And the Democrats have been very, very public about it.
[00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:31.049]  So if we simply have real congressional hearings about this, where I'm called and others are called, they will be exposed.
[00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:32.611]  They've had a bunch of hearings lying about me.
[00:25:33.624 --> 00:25:38.849]  Saying that I need to be deplatformed, but I'm never there to actually speak for myself.
[00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:43.594]  This is completely one-sided and totally deceptive because they can't handle me being there.
[00:25:43.594 --> 00:25:50.141]  So again, they secretly report you, they defame you, they lie about you, and then you never get to see what you've done or face your accuser.
[00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:53.144]  This is the essence of totalitarianism.
[00:25:53.144 --> 00:25:53.844]  And President Trump...
[00:25:54.872 --> 00:26:03.654]  The Republican Congress, the state houses, independent media all need to rally together against this global move to censor America and the planet.
[00:26:03.654 --> 00:26:10.536]  Because if you look at what Facebook, Google, Apple, and all of them are doing right now, it's mirroring the EU censorship.
[00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:11.416]  And why is that?
[00:26:11.416 --> 00:26:19.958]  The EU has been fining them billions of dollars if they don't get in line on hate speech and fake news, which is whatever Brussels and the unelected bureaucrats say it is.
[00:26:20.851 --> 00:26:28.015]  So it's China, the EU and others, muscling in on America, with all these global regulations, trying to force their will on us.
[00:26:28.015 --> 00:26:30.217]  France is passing laws to shut down populists.
[00:26:30.217 --> 00:26:32.298]  Brazil's passing laws to shut down populists.
[00:26:33.852 --> 00:26:36.535]  They don't want the people having control of their own destiny.
[00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:41.759]  This is modern global corporate colonialism against every nation state on the planet.
[00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:47.404]  Be you first world, old world, or be you a third world nation.
[00:26:47.404 --> 00:26:48.725]  This is history.
[00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:49.966]  It's happening now.
[00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:54.130]  We're the tip of the spear at NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.551]  In closing,
[00:26:55.285 --> 00:27:06.688]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast.
[00:27:06.688 --> 00:27:11.269]  Just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:22.412]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[00:27:23.072 --> 00:27:35.615]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:27:35.615 --> 00:27:37.296]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:38.256]  You're an adult.
[00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:40.536]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[00:27:40.536 --> 00:27:45.818]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[00:27:45.818 --> 00:27:49.639]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:49.859]  Listen.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.281]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[00:27:52.281 --> 00:27:56.204]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[00:27:56.204 --> 00:27:57.424]  We've been very successful.
[00:27:57.424 --> 00:27:59.125]  I've expected to be attacked.
[00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:01.447]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear.
[00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:02.447]  But it's happened.
[00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:07.511]  So now InfoWars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:12.734]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech.
[00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:15.296]  And you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:18.658]  InfoWars is trending at the top of Twitter right now.
[00:28:18.658 --> 00:28:21.180]  And we've got record traffic at InfoWars and NewsWars.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.481]  But they think in a few days you'll forget about it.
[00:28:23.481 --> 00:28:26.903]  Then they'll move on to the next target, and the next target, and the next target.
[00:28:26.903 --> 00:28:30.306]  Notice they would only partially ban us here, partially ban us there.
[00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:32.207]  They would cry wolf if they were going to ban us.
[00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:35.409]  Until when they finally ban us, they're hoping you're not paying attention.
[00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:36.250]  They're hoping you're stupid.
[00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.771]  They're hoping you believe the fake narratives about us and the lies.
[00:28:38.771 --> 00:28:43.114]  Alright, that full response video is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:28:43.114 --> 00:28:43.855]  I think I'm ready.
[00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.476]  When we come back!
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:52.124]  ...to lay out what's happened, what's currently happening, what's coming, and how we stop them.
[00:28:52.124 --> 00:28:59.489]  You're gonna get the absolute breakdown that they know is accurate, so accurate, they keep asking people associated with us how we do this.

[00:32:56.289 --> 00:32:57.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:16.162]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:21.294]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:38.109 --> 00:34:02.131]  This is my official statement on the concerted plan to erase my electronic identity and put me into a true electronic ghetto that Matt Drudge first warned the world of two and a half years ago after he had meetings with high-level federal officials in the judiciary and in the executive and was warned of the takeover plan that Hillary was planning to launch once she got elected.
[00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:30.012]  Patriots were aware of the plan and fought back and elected Donald Trump, who's been valiantly exposing the enemy of the American people, the mainstream corporate news that ostracizes and kicks anybody out who's real, like the famous CBS reporter Cheryl Atkinson, who exposed that Obama was false flagging shipping guns into Mexico to then get people killed to blame gun owners and the Second Amendment.
[00:34:30.012 --> 00:34:31.714]  Almost everyone has been purged.
[00:34:33.408 --> 00:34:51.142]  And mainstream corporate media, with its dying audiences, its dwindling audiences, are now engines of censorship and harassment against those that try to actually follow the Constitution and restore our Republic, and who try to then shut down all of their competition.
[00:34:51.142 --> 00:34:58.588]  They are now terrorist organizations, most of them on the Communist Chinese payroll, which, by the grace of God, is now breaking.
[00:34:58.588 --> 00:34:59.749]  And that's the big takeaway.
[00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:11.173]  Number one, Infowars is under attack because we will tell you what the president knows, but has been advised not to say because it could damage the stock market and kill confidence.
[00:35:11.173 --> 00:35:14.294]  I believe, though, that an emergency surgery is needed.
[00:35:14.294 --> 00:35:17.895]  We have to go ahead and admit it because the enemy has not backed down.
[00:35:17.895 --> 00:35:23.297]  China infiltrated the major universities, the government, the Democratic Party particularly, that's all coming out.
[00:35:24.363 --> 00:35:28.686]  The Office of Personnel Management hacked 21 million names of our entire key infrastructure.
[00:35:28.686 --> 00:35:31.168]  It was given to the Chi-Coms.
[00:35:31.168 --> 00:35:32.128]  They own Hollywood.
[00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:33.389]  They own the national debt.
[00:35:33.389 --> 00:35:34.430]  We have been set up.
[00:35:36.007 --> 00:35:44.612]  And just today, if you go to DrudgeReport.com, China is threatening to basically take over Apple and shut down the factories over there that is already state-run.
[00:35:44.612 --> 00:35:45.872]  Apple had been state-run for a while.
[00:35:45.872 --> 00:35:48.994]  They announced it four months ago to get total tax exemption.
[00:35:48.994 --> 00:35:51.555]  I just wanted to point it out that we've been hammering that.
[00:35:51.555 --> 00:35:52.796]  That's the main reason they panicked.
[00:35:52.796 --> 00:36:05.223]  I've been told from high-level sources inside Google and inside the Washington Post, particularly, that they have become very upset that I keep saying that the Russiagate thing
[00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:14.336]  This is a distraction for the real China gate, global gate, where our own elites have sold us out.
[00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:25.644]  The EU, Davos, had the Chinese dictator there a year and a half ago, and he said, with Juncker, we will defeat America, we will defeat Trump, we will crush them economically.
[00:36:25.644 --> 00:36:29.366]  You've got the big tech heads saying, we'll crush conservatives, we'll crush Trump.
[00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:31.548]  These are in public statements.
[00:36:31.548 --> 00:36:33.910]  So, here's the big news.
[00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.551]  A, this is globalist and Chinese run.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.582]  B, it's totally illegal, out of control, if we just expose it, they're done.
[00:36:39.582 --> 00:36:51.712]  But most importantly, they are launching the full-out censorship against everyone I know.
[00:36:51.712 --> 00:36:55.615]  Every Republican congressman other than McCain.
[00:36:55.615 --> 00:36:58.317]  All of Ron Paul's staff.
[00:36:58.317 --> 00:36:59.078]  Senator Paul.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.481]  You can go test their accounts.
[00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:03.621]  We've done it.
[00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:06.083]  They're major sites that do the testing.
[00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.244]  They're all shadow banned.
[00:37:08.244 --> 00:37:09.264]  93% is the new number.
[00:37:09.264 --> 00:37:11.826]  It was 80% just a few months ago.
[00:37:11.826 --> 00:37:14.347]  It's 93% ahead of the midterms.
[00:37:14.347 --> 00:37:17.129]  This is election meddling.
[00:37:17.129 --> 00:37:19.370]  Everything they claim we're doing, they're doing.
[00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.232]  This is out in the open, the big tech giants themselves.
[00:37:22.232 --> 00:37:24.233]  So, China's involved, so it's treason.
[00:37:25.572 --> 00:37:34.820]  They're trying to affect the midterms, they're ratcheting everything down, and now they're setting the precedent, with yours truly, to completely de-platform.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.802]  Tortious interference.
[00:37:37.802 --> 00:37:41.525]  New companies have banned us just in the last hour.
[00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:45.809]  And ladies and gentlemen, wait till you hear this.
[00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:50.953]  Now, let's get into the facts.
[00:37:50.953 --> 00:37:52.675]  Dr. McCamp shot right here, please.
[00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:02.540]  Stefan Molyneux made the point.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.501]  First, they came for Alex Jones and I did not speak out because I wasn't Alex Jones.
[00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:13.663]  Just as Senator Ted Cruz has said, just as Donald Trump Jr.
[00:38:13.663 --> 00:38:21.585]  has said, just as Tucker Carlson has said, but everybody else is strangely silent, which is very, very foolish.
[00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:24.486]  Michael Savage has been speaking out on this show today.
[00:38:24.486 --> 00:38:26.487]  We're finding out who the Americans are, who's free speech.
[00:38:30.267 --> 00:38:36.333]  Democrat Senator Demands More Censorship of Conservative Media.
[00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:37.134]  We knew that was coming.
[00:38:37.134 --> 00:38:39.056]  I'm going to go through each of these.
[00:38:39.056 --> 00:38:46.323]  And of course we knew that was coming because Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:53.130]  They say it's the only way to save democracy, the survival of democracy, is to shut down everybody's free speech.
[00:38:54.522 --> 00:39:02.169]  First they launched a year and a half long demonization campaign of yours truly, second only to the demonization campaign against Trump.
[00:39:02.169 --> 00:39:03.671]  And it's the same story.
[00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:04.652]  Alex hurts children.
[00:39:04.652 --> 00:39:05.312]  No evidence.
[00:39:05.312 --> 00:39:06.754]  Alex said this about people's families.
[00:39:06.754 --> 00:39:07.534]  No evidence.
[00:39:07.534 --> 00:39:09.596]  Trump has babies taken from their parents.
[00:39:09.596 --> 00:39:10.797]  Not true.
[00:39:10.797 --> 00:39:12.859]  Trump says all Mexicans are criminals and rapists.
[00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:13.740]  Not true.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.402]  So first they ran a big demonization.
[00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:18.816]  To build me into this strawman demon.
[00:39:18.816 --> 00:39:22.937]  Then they come in and start saying, oh, we're private companies, we can censor you.
[00:39:22.937 --> 00:39:28.318]  And then they start deplatforming you continually until you can't even have a bank account.
[00:39:28.318 --> 00:39:34.500]  That's the communist Chinese global social score model that big tech has been at conferences admitting they're planning.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.981]  So they've got CNN, MSNBC, all up and together, the New York Times.
[00:39:39.173 --> 00:39:44.836]  At these conferences, going back five months ago, and they publicly then announced this plan.
[00:39:44.836 --> 00:39:46.016]  That's how we knew it was coming.
[00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.697]  So, the CHICOMs are involved.
[00:39:47.697 --> 00:39:48.778]  It's high treason.
[00:39:48.778 --> 00:39:51.119]  It's donations-in-kind election meddling.
[00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:56.642]  The Democrats are now going public with the plan because their plan got leaked to reason.
[00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:05.334]  Got no attention for a week except InfoWars.com and our audience, and now TopOfDrugReport.com.
[00:40:05.334 --> 00:40:07.295]  Socials clamped down on InfoWars.
[00:40:07.295 --> 00:40:09.096]  Instagram bans Tommy Robinson.
[00:40:09.096 --> 00:40:11.377]  Facebook blocks Republican candidates' ad.
[00:40:11.377 --> 00:40:12.758]  That's just the latest.
[00:40:12.758 --> 00:40:15.999]  Asked to change rules for journalists.
[00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:18.501]  Twitter suspends Libertarians' accounts.
[00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:19.601]  Ron Paul's.
[00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:22.743]  Senate dims circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[00:40:24.147 --> 00:40:27.149]  Survival of the democracy depends on banning sites.
[00:40:27.149 --> 00:40:29.330]  Banning the sites!
[00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:33.632]  And the Democrats are saying ban the sites themselves.
[00:40:33.632 --> 00:40:40.115]  And Fox News is now at the top of the list.
[00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:42.016]  And the folks running News Corp want that.
[00:40:42.016 --> 00:40:47.939]  They want to use that outside power to bully their host into submission.
[00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:50.180]  To basically become what CNN was 10 years ago.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.981]  Kind of globalist lite.
[00:40:54.301 --> 00:40:59.744]  Now that Facebook, YouTube, and Apple have come for Alex Jones, now they'll come for the rest of us, says Michael Snyder.
[00:40:59.744 --> 00:41:01.085]  And indeed they have.
[00:41:01.085 --> 00:41:01.946]  Mid-term meddling.
[00:41:01.946 --> 00:41:05.048]  Facebook blocks Republican candidates' ad.
[00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:06.148]  The crackdown continues.
[00:41:06.148 --> 00:41:10.571]  Twitter suspends Libertarian accounts, including Ron Paul Institute director.
[00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:14.514]  But going over all this for you, and now here's the new news.
[00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:19.737]  They've got all these laws on email where it's almost impossible to send it to people, so we use one of the biggest companies, MailChimp.
[00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:24.031]  You don't even know that unless you basically try to get in and look at our servers.
[00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:25.512]  They have said the exact same thing.
[00:41:25.512 --> 00:41:31.336]  After review, we've determined that your account is in violation of our terms of use and has been disabled from sending.
[00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:32.377]  Affected immediately.
[00:41:32.377 --> 00:41:36.279]  You may log into your account for the next 48 hours to retrieve your data.
[00:41:36.279 --> 00:41:38.400]  MailChimp Compliance.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.381]  Total Kafka-esque.
[00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:40.462]  We're put into the phantom zone.
[00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:43.583]  Hey, the President is too.
[00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:47.464]  West Hollywood votes to remove Donald Trump's Walk of Fame star.
[00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:51.326]  Because the left kept attacking it and beating it up.
[00:41:51.326 --> 00:42:03.871]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control of the schools, control of your bank account, control of the churches, control of the food you eat, control of the vaccines they put in your body, control of the internet, control of everything.
[00:42:03.871 --> 00:42:04.231]  They're here.
[00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:10.540]  Alex Jones Infowars removed from LinkedIn.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.321]  Still up on Instagram and Twitter.
[00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:13.582]  Yes, I misspoke when I said Instagram.
[00:42:13.582 --> 00:42:14.542]  I'm still on Instagram.
[00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:16.723]  I've been taken off Pinterest, excuse me.
[00:42:16.723 --> 00:42:17.523]  But LinkedIn!
[00:42:17.523 --> 00:42:20.465]  I don't think I even set that up.
[00:42:20.465 --> 00:42:25.327]  But the point is, it's, oh, now I can't hang my shingle out if I wanted a job.
[00:42:25.327 --> 00:42:27.828]  That's truly being sent to the electronic ghetto.
[00:42:29.224 --> 00:42:31.685]  And after they take you to the ghetto, what do they do?
[00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:33.705]  They arrest you!
[00:42:33.705 --> 00:42:37.186]  And here it is, Scarborough calls for Alex Jones to be arrested.
[00:42:37.186 --> 00:42:39.626]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[00:42:39.626 --> 00:42:49.388]  And for Infowars to be completely removed, you need to be investigated for that young intern who got found with her brains bashed out in the middle of the night in your office.
[00:42:49.388 --> 00:42:53.209]  Lori Klausiewicz was her name.
[00:42:53.209 --> 00:42:55.090]  Lori Klausiewicz.
[00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:56.330]  Is that how you say it?
[00:42:59.204 --> 00:43:03.326]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:43:03.326 --> 00:43:10.389]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:15.212]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:43:15.212 --> 00:43:22.095]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[00:43:22.535 --> 00:43:28.539]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:37.684]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[00:43:38.124 --> 00:43:45.570]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[00:43:59.426 --> 00:44:04.287]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.287 --> 00:44:13.189]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:18.530]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:26.792]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[00:44:26.912 --> 00:44:27.232]  I think so.
[00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:56.827]  Calm.
[00:45:00.313 --> 00:45:06.818]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:45:06.818 --> 00:45:13.644]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:29.177]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:34.169]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:46:40.726 --> 00:46:44.049]  InfoWars Life wants to bring you a sleep support formula
[00:46:44.189 --> 00:46:45.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.492]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.492 --> 00:47:31.314]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[00:47:31.314 --> 00:47:33.115]  What you're witnessing
[00:47:57.099 --> 00:48:03.022]  Is the globalists preparing to make their move on President Trump and the populist awakening and the American resurgence that's happened?
[00:48:03.022 --> 00:48:05.883]  I told everyone they're coming to ban us.
[00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:06.983]  They were admitting they wanted to.
[00:48:06.983 --> 00:48:13.946]  They had Soros Group, BuzzFeed, The New York Times, all of these anti-American organizations calling for us to be shut down.
[00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:15.967]  These are true American haters.
[00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:18.048]  Born, bred, trained for it.
[00:48:18.048 --> 00:48:19.529]  Chinese communists funded on record.
[00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.069]  It's all coming out in the news.
[00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:22.590]  Led by Tim Cook at Apple.
[00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:41.772]  And now they're involved in massive economic warfare against the American people, and they're giving donations illegally, violating federal election laws, with billions of dollars of Republican ads and conservative information being blocked on these platforms to try to ensure that they win.
[00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:43.761]  The midterms coming up.
[00:48:43.761 --> 00:48:51.373]  You've had Google list all Republicans in California as Nazis on their official candidate front page.
[00:48:51.373 --> 00:48:56.202]  You've seen everything they've been trying to do and the Republican Congress has been in a coma.
[00:48:57.383 --> 00:49:19.441]  They had hearings about the censorship, and when those presidents and VPs of the big tech companies sat there and witnessed all of that, and when they saw how ignorant Congress was, and the House Judiciary Committee and other areas, it green-lighted an avalanche of censorship.
[00:49:19.441 --> 00:49:26.367]  So, there is a massive cascade of people wanting publicity and wanting, with Trump derangement syndrome, to pile on
[00:49:27.844 --> 00:49:37.649]  To an attack against Infowars, to set the precedent to shut us down, to set the precedent to shut everybody else down.
[00:49:37.649 --> 00:49:50.616]  And now we've got Democrat Senators, Democrat Congresspeople, leak memos, public statements, shut down Tucker Carlson, shut down Matt Drudge, shut down Fox News, shut down everybody!
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.822]  And then LinkedIn bans me, so I couldn't even get a job if I lost this job.
[00:49:55.822 --> 00:49:56.783]  Trying to make me bankrupt?
[00:49:56.783 --> 00:50:01.865]  They admit they are, and then you can't even hang out a shingle to try to get a job.
[00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:03.746]  That's true authoritarianism.
[00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:06.868]  That's true fascism.
[00:50:06.868 --> 00:50:10.730]  And here's another headline with virtue signaling from TechCrunch.
[00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:15.653]  Now even YouPorn has banned Alex Jones, but he's still on Twitter.
[00:50:17.912 --> 00:50:22.097]  And that's because Twitter knows it's under investigation because of the shadow banning right now.
[00:50:22.097 --> 00:50:26.102]  That's the only reason, because it was the one thing that the committee got right.
[00:50:26.102 --> 00:50:30.146]  The one thing they signaled they were looking at.
[00:50:30.146 --> 00:50:31.728]  And so Jack Dorsey backed off.
[00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:33.390]  For now.
[00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.512]  Like you're on the campfire with...
[00:50:35.828 --> 00:50:44.056]  Your fires, you got your kids with you, you don't have any weapons, but you've got fire, and the fire's burning out, you don't have any more kindling, and the wolves are coming in.
[00:50:44.056 --> 00:50:54.867]  But Dorsey got a little close, fire almost scalded him, got his whiskers, so he jumped back and started stalking in the night, those red eyes.
[00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:56.308]  I'll crush the conservatives, yeah.
[00:50:59.497 --> 00:51:03.119]  But do Republicans see that and go, oh, the answer is antitrust.
[00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:04.380]  The answer, tell them all back down.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:09.163]  The answer, talk about China in control and funding it, which is now mainstream news.
[00:51:09.163 --> 00:51:15.447]  I knew years ago, Dianne Feinstein is a Chinese operative.
[00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:19.550]  Her and her husband have gotten billions in Chinese investment.
[00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:22.932]  Yes, her husband.
[00:51:22.932 --> 00:51:25.514]  They own biotech laboratories in China.
[00:51:27.895 --> 00:51:38.877]  Part of that deal was putting one of their agents directly in command of her daily schedule, and her driver, and her valet, and her attache, her aide-de-camp.
[00:51:38.877 --> 00:51:46.259]  You make a deal with China, you marry them, just like Apple announced five months ago they were moving to China and becoming state-run.
[00:51:46.259 --> 00:51:55.781]  And now China says today, in its official People's Daily, you tried trade war with us, we'll shut Apple off, because all your factories are here and they belong to us now.
[00:51:57.486 --> 00:52:00.269]  The headline was, no surrender to Trump.
[00:52:00.269 --> 00:52:06.756]  Apple is ours.
[00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:11.521]  And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[00:52:11.521 --> 00:52:17.067]  So I'm here hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering.
[00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:17.948]  And all these fools.
[00:52:19.104 --> 00:52:21.726]  And all these traders don't get it.
[00:52:21.726 --> 00:52:26.349]  That was our fun mock-up, if you're watching us on TV, of what the Drudge Report headlines should be.
[00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:29.972]  China, with the Apple cross through, regulates speech.
[00:52:29.972 --> 00:52:31.973]  Not that we're telling Drudge, it's something he doesn't already know.
[00:52:31.973 --> 00:52:37.677]  And then magically today, the Chinese say, we own and control Apple, we're holding it hostage.
[00:52:37.677 --> 00:52:41.540]  And that exact symbol is on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.722]  Because it's the truth.
[00:52:46.164 --> 00:52:47.846]  China uses Apple as bait.
[00:52:47.846 --> 00:52:49.208]  That's a way to say it nice.
[00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:53.253]  China is holding Apple hostage.
[00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:58.420]  China says we will not surrender with a gun to Apple's head.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.702]  Wow!
[00:52:59.702 --> 00:53:04.268]  As the Democrats openly call for the US economy to implode so they can teach us all a lesson.
[00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:10.471]  They've jumped the shark here with a bad calculation if people take action and folks get upset about this.
[00:53:10.471 --> 00:53:11.951]  And if people wake up, they're done.
[00:53:11.951 --> 00:53:14.152]  We have them right now.
[00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:19.574]  If Congress opens investigations right now into Chinagate, it's all happening with Dianne Feinstein.
[00:53:19.574 --> 00:53:24.716]  They're letting her know right now, they're aware of her activities.
[00:53:24.716 --> 00:53:27.157]  It's not the CIA running the New York Times or Washington Post, folks.
[00:53:27.157 --> 00:53:27.917]  It's foreign governments.
[00:53:31.977 --> 00:53:40.442]  If you look at it, quite frankly, Bezos is the least of the bad, because he actually is in competition with Alibaba and China, and I've got that from high-level sources.
[00:53:40.442 --> 00:53:45.545]  I looked into it, so it's the whole thing's a mess, and I'm trying to figure out all the players.
[00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:55.812]  But let me just tell you, if you aren't for Trump and Infowars, you're an idiot, because Trump's trying to turn this economy on and help everybody and take care of our veterans and bring us racially together and culturally together, and he's a patriot.
[00:53:57.625 --> 00:53:59.486]  Their attacks on us have already backfired.
[00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:00.487]  That's why they gotta go for broke.
[00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:11.193]  That's why CNN's like, take his apps down that I pay for, I build, they accept.
[00:54:11.193 --> 00:54:14.895]  You know, the radical Muslim groups can have their apps, but they're saying I can't.
[00:54:14.895 --> 00:54:15.736]  You know why?
[00:54:15.736 --> 00:54:17.037]  We launched this app three weeks ago.
[00:54:17.037 --> 00:54:19.418]  It was already in the top 30 before the censorship.
[00:54:19.418 --> 00:54:21.059]  Yeah, just a few weeks of news apps.
[00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:23.220]  It was like number 34.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.901]  Now it's number 4 today.
[00:54:27.037 --> 00:54:28.338]  at the iTunes Store.
[00:54:28.338 --> 00:54:29.479]  It's free.
[00:54:29.479 --> 00:54:30.379]  Number one is Twitter.
[00:54:30.379 --> 00:54:33.501]  Number two is News Break.
[00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:36.043]  Local and breaking all your local channels.
[00:54:36.043 --> 00:54:37.164]  That's a smart app.
[00:54:37.164 --> 00:54:39.525]  And Reddit.
[00:54:39.525 --> 00:54:42.167]  InfoWars is number four.
[00:54:42.167 --> 00:54:44.889]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:56.191]  But what everybody needs to do, because there's a good chance they're going to delete these, is contact everybody and say, this is torturous interference, this is racketeering, and if they do that, clearly there's lawsuits we'll win.
[00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:58.852]  But by then, the globalists would have taken the country or not.
[00:54:58.852 --> 00:55:01.594]  That's why we haven't gone with that strategy.
[00:55:01.594 --> 00:55:02.514]  A lawsuit.
[00:55:02.514 --> 00:55:05.075]  We may have to.
[00:55:05.075 --> 00:55:09.197]  But everybody should share Infowars.com and Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:09.197 --> 00:55:11.058]  And everyone should be proud of Infowars.
[00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:13.499]  Not the lies they put out, not the, well, he's crazy, but...
[00:55:14.215 --> 00:55:17.359]  Oh yeah, I told you Trump would win, told you the Chi-Coms were running it all.
[00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:22.586]  No, I'm crazy like a fox, and they know it.
[00:55:22.586 --> 00:55:25.469]  And right now all these cowards are looking to see which way the wind blows.
[00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:26.971]  They don't know who's going to win this fight.
[00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:29.174]  If Congress wakes up to the draconian takeover happening...
[00:55:30.307 --> 00:55:34.130]  And understands what they're dealing with and stopped acting like a bunch of bumpkins.
[00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.831]  We're going to win this.
[00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:46.800]  Now, I haven't barely plugged in the last day and I should be because when we've got record traffic and attention, if we can't raise extra money, when we go into the dark winter of the mass censorship that's coming, InfoWars will be shut down.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.521]  But it will continue on thanks to you.

[00:57:18.394 --> 00:57:20.416]  Uh, BuzzFeed did testing and it blew up in their faces.
[00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:22.897]  They found it was the number one vitamin B12 in the country.
[00:57:22.897 --> 00:57:27.020]  The most pure of the best.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.881]  Excuse me.
[00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:33.344]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:57:40.429 --> 00:57:46.673]  At Infowarsstore.com, standing with America, standing against the chi-coms in Hollywood, standing for victory and winning.
[00:57:46.673 --> 00:57:47.333]  Thanks to you.
[00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:47.794]  We'll be back.
[00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:55.595]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:57:55.595 --> 00:57:58.818]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:57:58.818 --> 00:58:02.521]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:07.225]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:58:07.225 --> 00:58:10.508]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:58:11.369 --> 00:58:22.375]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:58:22.375 --> 00:58:30.920]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:41.588]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[00:58:41.588 --> 00:58:50.435]  Try Bodies today at Infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:50.435 --> 00:58:58.140]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:58.621]  It's you!
[00:58:59.713 --> 00:59:01.896]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.896 --> 00:59:10.606]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.606 --> 00:59:15.211]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.211 --> 00:59:16.652]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.652 --> 00:59:20.176]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:32.245]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.245 --> 00:59:40.210]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:47.255]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.255 --> 00:59:50.017]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.368 --> 01:00:04.394]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.394 --> 01:00:09.977]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:25.562]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:36.425]  My response to the big global purge.
[01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:41.167]  Porn sites, boy, porn, who fought for the First Amendment so they could, you know, put out their stuff everywhere.
[01:00:41.167 --> 01:00:44.108]  Now, they're saying people are uploading my stuff to porn sites.
[01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.849]  They thought, oh, this is where we have freedom.
[01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:46.309]  We're like, no!
[01:00:47.987 --> 01:00:49.368]  No!
[01:00:49.368 --> 01:00:54.454]  You can have, you know, 50 guys simulate gang raping a girl that looks like she's 12.
[01:00:54.454 --> 01:00:56.055]  That's okay.
[01:00:56.055 --> 01:00:57.757]  But you cannot promote America.
[01:00:57.757 --> 01:00:58.878]  You cannot promote freedom.
[01:00:58.878 --> 01:01:02.001]  We're gonna just nebulously say you're an Islamophobe.
[01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:02.582]  And you know what?
[01:01:02.582 --> 01:01:04.103]  I was in a Cheesecake Factory with my...
[01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:11.651]  Life of $3 last night, and ladies came in, and I got video of it by the way, in full burkas, man.
[01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:13.691]  I mean, it was like Halloween.
[01:01:13.691 --> 01:01:16.032]  And that is a sign of their enslavement, their control.
[01:01:16.032 --> 01:01:21.573]  People are arrested in Saudi Arabia, you know, if they see their face.
[01:01:21.573 --> 01:01:27.075]  But the feminists are like, they see a nuclear family or a masculine man, they get triggered.
[01:01:27.075 --> 01:01:32.516]  But they hear us talk about how I'm worried about radical Islam and how it's not compatible in the West.
[01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:36.512]  And they ban us.
[01:01:36.512 --> 01:01:40.755]  So, you know, this is all San Francisco morals on us.
[01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:42.216]  The S-hole city, as it's known.
[01:01:42.216 --> 01:01:47.960]  I got a bunch of reports here that are really, really important.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.102]  But I think the one I want to get to right now is Portland.
[01:01:50.102 --> 01:01:53.384]  Stand down in the face of liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:58.988]  This is one of the real reasons I think they've been banning us off the internet is they just know that Antifa tries to intimidate and bully people.
[01:01:58.988 --> 01:02:00.929]  And three, four times the numbers of Patriots show up.
[01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.875]  And half of them are wearing InfoWars shirts or InfoWars stickers on.
[01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:06.576]  So that scares them.
[01:02:06.576 --> 01:02:10.757]  So let's go to that video report and I'll be back with the really big news on a whole bunch of fronts.
[01:02:10.757 --> 01:02:12.398]  Take your phone calls and more.
[01:02:12.398 --> 01:02:14.499]  And we have some special guests that I'll be telling you about.
[01:02:14.499 --> 01:02:15.599]  But right now, here's that report.
[01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.680]  Portland stand down in the face of liberty.
[01:02:27.425 --> 01:02:27.766]  Calm down!
[01:02:27.766 --> 01:02:29.267]  No one wants to hurt you, man!
[01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.208]  No one wants to hurt you, dude!
[01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:51.638]  Let him go!
[01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:52.339]  Hey, let him go!
[01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:53.499]  Let him go!
[01:02:53.499 --> 01:02:54.219]  Let him go!
[01:02:54.219 --> 01:02:56.380]  Hey, don't chase after him!
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.541]  Hey, just let him go!
[01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:01.963]  Hey, what have you thought about this so far?
[01:03:01.963 --> 01:03:04.824]  I was worried that there wasn't going to be this many people here.
[01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:06.465]  But we have a pretty good turnout.
[01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:08.706]  And honestly, so far it's just been fun.
[01:03:08.706 --> 01:03:09.967]  So far, yeah.
[01:03:09.967 --> 01:03:12.088]  And who knows, maybe it might stay that way.
[01:03:12.728 --> 01:03:15.691]  Me so far, we've been down here for about two hours.
[01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:18.053]  So far for me, I've just had a good time.
[01:03:18.053 --> 01:03:18.894]  Same here.
[01:03:18.894 --> 01:03:20.015]  No one's attacked me.
[01:03:20.015 --> 01:03:24.579]  I'm a black male and supposedly according to them over there, they want to attack everyone like me.
[01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:25.520]  It's not happening.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.381]  Hasn't happened.
[01:03:26.381 --> 01:03:27.402]  He's from the Infowars.
[01:03:27.402 --> 01:03:28.303]  Does he have white privilege?
[01:03:29.003 --> 01:03:29.443]  I don't know.
[01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:30.224]  Ask him.
[01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:32.004]  You know what?
[01:03:32.004 --> 01:03:33.285]  I'll answer that question.
[01:03:33.285 --> 01:03:35.906]  I have American privilege because I was born free.
[01:03:35.906 --> 01:03:38.267]  I don't have to deal with a communist government.
[01:03:38.267 --> 01:03:40.328]  That's all of our privilege as an American.
[01:03:40.328 --> 01:03:43.790]  And it's sad that you have thousands of people out here that march against their own birthright.
[01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:46.291]  I went down there and I tried to talk to them and they wouldn't even talk to me.
[01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.492]  They just cursed me out.
[01:03:47.492 --> 01:03:49.112]  Actually, I got in a little fight because of that.
[01:03:49.112 --> 01:03:50.853]  I got over there.
[01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:51.834]  Over on the other side?
[01:03:51.834 --> 01:03:54.475]  And I had my wheelchair, my walker, because I have Parkinson's.
[01:03:54.895 --> 01:03:56.036]  And they still struck you?
[01:03:56.036 --> 01:03:57.136]  They still struck me, yeah.
[01:03:57.136 --> 01:04:02.320]  And there were some people that came over here that were anti-Trump and leftists or liberals, and they didn't get hurt.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.541]  They were allowed to come over here and execute their right to free speech.
[01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:05.461]  Fascists!
[01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:06.002]  Retreat!
[01:04:06.002 --> 01:04:08.303]  Pull the boys off our streets!
[01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:12.846]  Latifah has put me on an anti-racism watch list.
[01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:14.927]  Are you also a white supremacist?
[01:04:14.927 --> 01:04:15.267]  Of course!
[01:04:15.267 --> 01:04:17.108]  We'll be ready if they want to attack us.
[01:04:17.108 --> 01:04:18.049]  You look like you're ready.
[01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:19.730]  Oh, I'm very ready.
[01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.951]  I'm from South Central LA.
[01:04:21.851 --> 01:04:23.032]  I'm of Mexican descent.
[01:04:23.032 --> 01:04:24.993]  I am a minority in your eyes.
[01:04:24.993 --> 01:04:25.653]  Can we talk?
[01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:27.695]  Can we chit-chat a little bit?
[01:04:27.695 --> 01:04:28.415]  Even Che Guevara?
[01:04:28.415 --> 01:04:30.136]  Can we speak about Che Guevara?
[01:04:30.136 --> 01:04:31.237]  And they don't want nothing, bro.
[01:04:31.237 --> 01:04:32.677]  They don't even know who he is, really.
[01:04:32.677 --> 01:04:33.198]  I'm a racist.
[01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:34.378]  I'm a fascist.
[01:04:34.378 --> 01:04:36.380]  They got no more ammunition, bro.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.540]  And let's be clear.
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.543]  The big multinational banks, China, all over trying to bring down Trump, trying to keep America from being rebooted.
[01:04:42.543 --> 01:04:46.806]  The patriots in America, in our own government, you name it, knew what was happening.
[01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:51.008]  General citizens took action and we're now in a battle to take the country back.
[01:04:51.008 --> 01:04:56.491]  We haven't won it yet, but we're in a battle and we've smoked the enemy out to show all their actions, what they're doing.
[01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:58.392]  And the left points and goes, look at the Nazis!
[01:04:58.392 --> 01:05:07.877]  Infowarslife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:07.877 --> 01:05:12.560]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.081]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[01:05:14.241 --> 01:05:14.421]  I think?
[01:05:33.942 --> 01:05:39.326]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.

[01:05:50.254 --> 01:05:52.396]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:55.018]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:16.875]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:24.137]  Harping on the wars we fight, griping about the way things ought to be.
[01:06:24.137 --> 01:06:30.919]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[01:06:30.919 --> 01:06:37.041]  But when they're running down our country, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:37.581]  Yeah!
[01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:45.253]  I told Merle Haggard bringing us in.
[01:06:45.253 --> 01:06:45.933]  Alright.
[01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:10.589]  I've announced what they've done to us.
[01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:11.690]  I've talked about what's happening to us.
[01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:13.090]  Let's talk about what's happening to you.
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:13.990]  Let's give you the data.
[01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.831]  Let's give you the intel.
[01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:16.051]  Let's go into the facts.
[01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:19.692]  Let's go into the meat and the guts of what's unfolding.
[01:07:19.692 --> 01:07:38.958]  We have a giant corporate swarm, an electronic lynch mob, organized by big tech giants Google, Facebook, and Apple, to completely ban us on the same night, Sunday evening, early in
[01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:44.181]  The Monday morning hours.
[01:07:44.181 --> 01:07:46.263]  Then to never show what we said or did.
[01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:54.292]  To give general politically correct hate speech statements.
[01:07:54.292 --> 01:08:01.459]  And to then de-platform us off of hundreds of other things like LinkedIn, MailChimp, you name it.
[01:08:01.459 --> 01:08:03.121]  And they're now going after the NRAs.
[01:08:05.387 --> 01:08:06.927]  Credit card processors.
[01:08:06.927 --> 01:08:09.448]  They're going to go after your credit card processors.
[01:08:09.448 --> 01:08:12.729]  And now we have leaked memos from the Democrats a week ago.
[01:08:12.729 --> 01:08:15.209]  And now the Drudge Report linked to it.
[01:08:15.209 --> 01:08:17.089]  They had to report it.
[01:08:17.089 --> 01:08:22.211]  And so they said, yes, we believe banning Republicans off the Internet is the way to go.
[01:08:22.211 --> 01:08:23.191]  I'm going to read those quotes.
[01:08:23.191 --> 01:08:24.631]  So.
[01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:26.751]  They're coming after everyone.
[01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:28.992]  They first demonized me.
[01:08:28.992 --> 01:08:33.233]  They first lied about me to set the precedent.
[01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:33.593]  And now.
[01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:41.603]  We've got prominent Democrats everywhere saying, take Fox News off the air.
[01:08:41.603 --> 01:08:43.084]  Ban a whole news organization.
[01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:50.266]  You know, on iTunes and Stitcher and a bunch of other places, there was one area that
[01:08:53.581 --> 01:09:00.805]  David Knight, one of our longtime hosts of six, seven years, was surpassing some of my stats, which is great.
[01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:03.266]  But when you're here longer, you know, it's hard for folks to get to that level.
[01:09:03.266 --> 01:09:04.807]  We want David to be the biggest thing in the country.
[01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:13.512]  He's a great, smart, intellectual guy, very polite, very genteel, doesn't even say the word poo-poo on air, very family-friendly.
[01:09:13.512 --> 01:09:20.416]  He got banned on a whole bunch of platforms, and he had something like 10 million downloads
[01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:26.961]  On one of the podcast sites a month.
[01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:30.043]  And they just blew it all away.
[01:09:30.043 --> 01:09:31.323]  And his YouTube.
[01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:37.206]  And a bunch of other platforms that were actually his.
[01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:43.749]  And as WikiLeaks said, The Empire Strikes Back, Apple, Spotify, Facebook, and Google, YouTube all purge InfoWars.
[01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:46.110]  Alex Jones, yes, InfoWars is frequent nonsense.
[01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:48.291]  You mean the media puts it out and you believe it.
[01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.412]  But also a state power critique.
[01:09:52.622 --> 01:10:01.607]  Which publisher in the world with millions of subscribers is next to be wiped out for cultural transgression?
[01:10:01.607 --> 01:10:09.892]  And they went on and said San Francisco, where the tech giants are really based, is the imperial elite of culture.
[01:10:09.892 --> 01:10:12.053]  And they're going to tell you what flies and what doesn't.
[01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:20.032]  That's why if you've got transsexuals, they call it a drag queen festival.
[01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:21.613]  They say that's a hate word so I can't use it.
[01:10:21.613 --> 01:10:22.053]  They can.
[01:10:22.053 --> 01:10:26.376]  It's all this two-class system.
[01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:38.204]  Sexualizing two and three-year-olds at a public event with people pole dancing and shaking their rear ends in babies' faces and little toddlers putting money in their g-strings.
[01:10:38.204 --> 01:10:38.805]  I mean if it was
[01:10:42.475 --> 01:10:45.436]  Marilyn Monroe on her prime, twerking to a two-year-old.
[01:10:45.436 --> 01:10:47.656]  I'd say it was sick and evil.
[01:10:47.656 --> 01:10:52.998]  But man, there's something special about a guy in a purple wig who weighs 300 pounds shaking his ass in a little kid's face.
[01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:55.979]  And they said I was obscene in that video.
[01:10:55.979 --> 01:10:57.699]  It was on the news.
[01:10:57.699 --> 01:11:04.621]  Naked men with glitter on their chest and their genitals out, but glued to their bodies.
[01:11:04.621 --> 01:11:06.181]  We're not even going to show it.
[01:11:06.181 --> 01:11:09.082]  They could show it to kids, but we can't show it to you.
[01:11:12.714 --> 01:11:18.980]  Even though we're banned on all these platforms, I'm going to take the high road.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.121]  But you can still go find copies online.
[01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:27.387]  We're going to find all the names of those old videos because everybody else copied them and start going, here are the 35,000 banned videos.
[01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:30.810]  The whole library burned down.
[01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:31.871]  Here's one they didn't want you to see.
[01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:32.832]  Here's another they didn't want you to see.
[01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:38.997]  But it was the sexualization, and people couldn't believe it.
[01:11:38.997 --> 01:11:41.918]  So it got a couple million views, and they deleted that copy.
[01:11:41.918 --> 01:11:45.540]  So Millie Weaver put it back up, and it got about a half million views, and they took that down.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.521]  They never even met an issue.
[01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:50.402]  They didn't give us a strike, because they knew they couldn't stand on it.
[01:11:50.402 --> 01:11:53.423]  So we put it up again.
[01:11:53.423 --> 01:11:55.464]  And last time I checked, it had about 100,000 views.
[01:11:55.464 --> 01:12:01.687]  And people, liberals, conservatives, you name it, were like, this is evil, this is sick, this is crazy.
[01:12:01.687 --> 01:12:03.408]  And guess particularly who thought it was evil?
[01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:04.749]  Hispanics and blacks.
[01:12:07.648 --> 01:12:16.953]  And you see, we went and we sent four reporters and crew members to Portland where the Antifa said you're not allowed to march.
[01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:18.354]  They said all Christians are Nazis.
[01:12:18.354 --> 01:12:20.915]  Christians aren't allowed in the city, literally.
[01:12:20.915 --> 01:12:22.496]  And the media support of the police stood down.
[01:12:22.496 --> 01:12:24.857]  So we sent a crew there and we sent one to Berkeley the next day.
[01:12:24.857 --> 01:12:28.399]  And we had millions of views online.
[01:12:28.399 --> 01:12:32.381]  The videos had gone viral despite the shadow banning.
[01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.382]  The tyrants in Portland stood down in the face of liberty.
[01:12:34.382 --> 01:12:36.003]  So did Berkeley, San Francisco.
[01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:54.765]  So because, literally, in the videos that they've now deleted and banned, we can show you them here, there was a good 15% were black, that's a little over population numbers, and a good 20-30% were Hispanic, that's about populist numbers.
[01:12:54.765 --> 01:13:01.227]  So it was demographically a cut out of society, all together loving on each other for freedom,
[01:13:02.699 --> 01:13:06.281]  And Antifa beating up a man that's partially paralyzed.
[01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.261]  There he is on his walker.
[01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:09.502]  It says muscular dystrophy.
[01:13:09.502 --> 01:13:11.823]  They beat him up.
[01:13:11.823 --> 01:13:24.569]  So the image of a little Hispanic man wearing red, white, and blue being beaten up by a bunch of white meth heads, white guys, and you go to the other side, they were 95% white.
[01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:28.751]  Saying everyone on the other side are Nazis and beating everyone up.
[01:13:30.714 --> 01:13:31.755]  And that's why they banned us.
[01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:33.956]  That was the last straw.
[01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:41.420]  Exposing China's control of Apple and the leveraging of Google and them setting up search engine censorship here and there.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.041]  The midterms coming up.
[01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:47.443]  The fact that it's showing in even skewed polls, even Gallup polls that are cooked.
[01:13:47.443 --> 01:13:54.707]  Double the support Hispanics and Blacks ever seen for a Republican candidate in modern history.
[01:13:54.707 --> 01:13:59.610]  Even though the Republicans were the party of Christians and minorities.
[01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:03.451]  And they're in full panic mode.
[01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:16.417]  I mean, when they saw these videos, and everybody else was pointing it out, and I pointed it out on air, and I noticed the organizers were pointing it out, because the organizers are Japanese, well, half Japanese, half Amerasian.
[01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:19.819]  When they pointed that out, they were freaked out.
[01:14:19.819 --> 01:14:29.963]  You saw all those little antifa meth-head white guys looking at a whole bunch of like big six-foot-four black guys that look like linebackers, wearing red, white, and blue Trump 45 shirts?
[01:14:29.963 --> 01:14:31.184]  They looked
[01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:36.451]  In one scene, one was calling them Nazis, and it's a bunch of black guys and hispanic guys going, we're not Nazis.
[01:14:36.451 --> 01:14:39.014]  And the guy actually just sits down and looks at the ground.
[01:14:39.014 --> 01:14:48.303]  He goes... Because they're just brainwashed, crazy people that want to run around screaming Nazi all day, you know, in between whatever they're doing to their bodies.
[01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:51.551]  When we come back, I'm going to go over all of it.
[01:14:51.551 --> 01:14:52.351]  I'm going to give the number out.
[01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:54.452]  We've got some guests coming up, too.
[01:14:54.452 --> 01:14:56.472]  But this is history, because we can act confident.
[01:14:56.472 --> 01:14:57.333]  We're having some gains.
[01:14:57.333 --> 01:15:01.213]  But it's because we are so successful, they're coming after all of you.
[01:15:01.213 --> 01:15:02.374]  So they're censoring everybody.
[01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:04.254]  They're shadowbanning anybody who's conservative.
[01:15:04.254 --> 01:15:06.774]  They're blocking all these Republicans from Facebook and Twitter.
[01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:10.335]  Total violation of campaign finance law.
[01:15:10.335 --> 01:15:11.856]  It's donations to the Democrats.
[01:15:11.856 --> 01:15:13.036]  They're doing it in plain views.
[01:15:13.036 --> 01:15:14.436]  We've got a big problem in Congress.
[01:15:14.436 --> 01:15:15.656]  They're as dumb as a box of rocks.
[01:15:15.656 --> 01:15:17.277]  Trump gets it.
[01:15:17.277 --> 01:15:18.377]  But the mainstream media is the enemy.
[01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:26.094]  For their lies about everything and trying to stop the recovery and, you know, Bill Maher saying, I hope there's a depression to bankrupt Americans.
[01:15:26.094 --> 01:15:28.955]  That's enemy talk.
[01:15:28.955 --> 01:15:40.457]  But the fact that they're trying to purge us off the web, period, and economically totally shut us down and saying, they're now saying, oh, we're going to de-platform anything Alex Jones off Google or off YouTube.
[01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:42.758]  Just, you know, you upload it.
[01:15:42.758 --> 01:15:43.658]  Well, then challenge that.
[01:15:43.658 --> 01:15:44.218]  Do it.
[01:15:44.218 --> 01:15:47.119]  They're now saying just this person's banned.
[01:15:47.119 --> 01:15:48.419]  And if that isn't Nazi Germany,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.043]  I'll kiss your booty.
[01:15:51.043 --> 01:15:52.065]  We'll be right back.

[01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:09.132]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:18:09.132 --> 01:18:19.497]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books.
[01:18:19.617 --> 01:18:20.378]  Thank you, brother.
[01:18:34.674 --> 01:18:43.257]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:18:43.257 --> 01:18:48.159]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:53.761]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:02.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.602]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.602 --> 01:19:11.864]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.864 --> 01:19:14.645]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.385 --> 01:19:19.190]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:25.678]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:30.643]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.383 --> 01:19:35.305]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.305 --> 01:19:42.509]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.509 --> 01:19:47.211]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:53.415]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.415 --> 01:19:57.397]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:20.283]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:27.547]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.547 --> 01:20:30.309]  Okay, let's get into the facts here.
[01:20:32.935 --> 01:20:35.917]  A multinational global combine is trying to take the US over.
[01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:37.539]  It already thought it had control.
[01:20:37.539 --> 01:20:38.359]  Trump got elected.
[01:20:38.359 --> 01:20:39.200]  Patriots are awake.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.902]  Nationalism is exploding.
[01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:41.682]  People are waking up.
[01:20:41.682 --> 01:20:42.683]  The economy is coming back.
[01:20:42.683 --> 01:20:44.524]  They're panicking.
[01:20:44.524 --> 01:20:47.307]  So, how do they shut down free speech?
[01:20:47.307 --> 01:20:50.770]  Well, you pick somebody, you demonize them, and then you do it.
[01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:55.954]  And then once people go along with that test case, you move forward against everybody.
[01:20:57.529 --> 01:21:06.432]  End of the midterms, then you get your Congress elected as Democrat, then you can start the impeachment, then Mueller can put out all his BS.
[01:21:06.432 --> 01:21:07.473]  The rest is history.
[01:21:07.473 --> 01:21:09.053]  This is a red alert.
[01:21:09.053 --> 01:21:10.074]  Call C-SPAN.
[01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.194]  Call Talk Radio.
[01:21:11.194 --> 01:21:13.415]  Call Congress.
[01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:22.098]  It's been a long time since I did a lot of interviews, because I'm so busy running things here, but I've agreed to dozens and dozens of interviews in the next few days.
[01:21:22.098 --> 01:21:26.600]  Michael Savage this afternoon, a whole bunch of others, Gavin McGinnis, the list goes on and on.
[01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:35.619]  And I'm doing it because I'm giving my full expenditure of will and energy to this thing.
[01:21:35.619 --> 01:21:38.020]  And now's the time for you to do that as well.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.681]  Because we're winning.
[01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:43.883]  And I was so happy Saturday and Sunday when I was covering those videos.
[01:21:43.883 --> 01:21:50.607]  And I saw the love, the white folks, the blacks, the Hispanics, everybody together, the Asians, loving America, loving freedom.
[01:21:52.028 --> 01:22:03.591]  People saying, I was a Democrat but I believe in free speech and I don't believe in beating people up and Trump's really a moderate and a populist and doing reasonable things and they lied about him and I looked into it and it wasn't true and I'm just not going to be part of this.
[01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:05.412]  That's beautiful!
[01:22:05.412 --> 01:22:07.673]  That made me feel so good.
[01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:11.294]  I looked at some of the crew and I said, they're going to ban this.
[01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:16.815]  Because they could see a third of the people's shirts were Infowars.
[01:22:16.815 --> 01:22:18.876]  Another 20% or so were ball caps or stickers.
[01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:23.972]  People say, man, don't you feel bad?
[01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:24.633]  They're coming after you.
[01:22:24.633 --> 01:22:25.853]  They're trying to shut you down.
[01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:28.536]  I'm not trying to make money here.
[01:22:28.536 --> 01:22:32.859]  The New York Times kept saying when they were talking to me last week, over and over again, the money, the money, you want more money.
[01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:43.787]  And I said, you understand that most big talk show hosts would have a big private jet and mansions here and there and all this other stuff, you know, and drive like Ferraris.
[01:22:44.813 --> 01:22:54.341]  That stuff's all fine and dandy, you know, driving a $60,000 car or whatever, having a decent sports jacket or flying first class sometimes, but I like being with the people.
[01:22:54.341 --> 01:22:58.845]  I want to spend my money on building something, changing history.
[01:22:58.845 --> 01:23:00.387]  And my ancestors were like that as well.
[01:23:01.403 --> 01:23:12.414]  And so I'm on the side of the family, direct line, I've been at the Stock Exchange, started the Texas Revolution, working directly under Jackson, was the treasurer of the state, raised Colonel Travis.
[01:23:12.414 --> 01:23:14.556]  I mean, that's just one little factoid.
[01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.758]  So I'm trying, I'm not even trying to measure up.
[01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.620]  I'm literally those people.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.321]  I can feel them.
[01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:26.956]  The energy, what they want to build, what they want to do, and they're calling out, be strong, build the future.
[01:23:26.956 --> 01:23:28.838]  What matters is if humanity fails.
[01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:30.039]  That's death.
[01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:30.899]  That's spiritual death.
[01:23:30.899 --> 01:23:38.745]  In fact, in my own mind, I think if the planet dies and the human species fails, I believe we are put in the type of purgatory.
[01:23:38.745 --> 01:23:40.426]  No one else has ever written this or said this.
[01:23:40.426 --> 01:23:45.470]  They talk about purgatory as a thing you pay indulgences to the Catholics, you know, to get your family out of it.
[01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:46.051]  I don't believe in that.
[01:23:47.301 --> 01:23:49.882]  Don't worry, the Pope abolished purgatory a few hundred years ago.
[01:23:49.882 --> 01:23:57.226]  I just instinctively know that, metaphysically, if the species fails, then we do die.
[01:23:57.226 --> 01:24:12.715]  Because we live through the genetics, we live through the ongoing experiences, we have the race memories, but there's a consciousness, there's a higher order that's been basically proven above that, that's a spirit, but if it gets cut off, if the species gets totally destroyed, that
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:23.288]  There's a type of spiritual death, and I'm not sure exactly how it works, but at a spiritual level, I know it.
[01:24:23.288 --> 01:24:25.070]  So, we need everybody to survive here.
[01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:26.751]  We need to make the species continue.
[01:24:26.751 --> 01:24:30.075]  Black, white, you know, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:30.075 --> 01:24:31.756]  We've got to make it together.
[01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:34.018]  This is the big test.
[01:24:34.018 --> 01:24:35.980]  I'm sorry, I didn't finish.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:39.484]  Mike Adams is coming on to cover it all, but let me just get the big one with you right now.
[01:24:44.108 --> 01:24:44.849]  This is so big.
[01:24:44.849 --> 01:24:46.209]  We've been harping on this for a week.
[01:24:46.209 --> 01:24:48.571]  It's now all over the news, thank God.
[01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:51.092]  His drudge report linked to it yesterday.
[01:24:51.092 --> 01:24:55.955]  So now the Democratic Senator involved comes out and goes, yeah, Jones is the rotting tip of the iceberg.
[01:24:55.955 --> 01:24:56.896]  Shut him down.
[01:24:56.896 --> 01:24:58.096]  Shut it all down.
[01:24:58.096 --> 01:25:00.137]  Shut them all down.
[01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:00.938]  Follow what we say.
[01:25:00.938 --> 01:25:01.538]  Do what we say.
[01:25:01.538 --> 01:25:03.940]  I mean, it's so criminal.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.101]  It's so naked.
[01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.102]  Because they're losing!
[01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:11.204]  And so they've just built this whole thing on this house of sand.
[01:25:12.421 --> 01:25:17.462]  By demonizing me, so they can then bring it on to the next person, the next person, the next person.
[01:25:17.462 --> 01:25:22.863]  This is so clear and present danger, so diabolical.
[01:25:22.863 --> 01:25:24.243]  So let's read it.
[01:25:24.243 --> 01:25:26.904]  Dem Senator demands more censorship of conservative media.
[01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:31.365]  These companies must do more than take down one website.
[01:25:31.365 --> 01:25:32.725]  That's right, websites.
[01:25:32.725 --> 01:25:35.226]  See, they want our website taken down.
[01:25:35.226 --> 01:25:37.106]  And they're hitting all of our infrastructure right now.
[01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:47.630]  Democrat Senator Chris Murphy has called for social media websites to ban more conservative news outlets in the aftermath of InfoWars being purged from the internet.
[01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:49.071]  This story is on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:49.071 --> 01:25:50.591]  It's so critical.
[01:25:50.591 --> 01:26:00.555]  Yesterday, Apple, Spotify, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube all deleted InfoWars in a coordinated assault on free speech that sent shockwaves throughout the media.
[01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:03.356]  And mainstream media is defending it, saying, why is he still on apps?
[01:26:03.356 --> 01:26:04.817]  Why is he still on Pinterest?
[01:26:04.817 --> 01:26:06.097]  Why has he still got credit cards?
[01:26:06.097 --> 01:26:08.178]  We want him gone!
[01:26:09.138 --> 01:26:10.360]  Talk about dangerous.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:16.369]  Murphy responded by celebrating the Vans and calling for more right wing sides to be targeted.
[01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:18.473]  This is Chris Murphy.
[01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.976]  Follow me to Beijing or Peking.
[01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:22.359]  Infowars is the tip.
[01:26:23.942 --> 01:26:25.684]  He has to admit it, doesn't he?
[01:26:41.027 --> 01:26:43.128]  Everything he's saying is about him.
[01:26:43.128 --> 01:26:51.053]  It should read, the Democratic Party is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook, YouTube, to tear our nation apart.
[01:26:51.053 --> 01:26:58.979]  The Democrats and people like me, Senator Chris Murphy, are committed to destroying you and your family because of our sick, corrupt evil and our sellout to Communist China.
[01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:00.399]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:27:00.399 --> 01:27:03.261]  I was putting a little bit of truth bot on that.
[01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.843]  Putin told me to say that.
[01:27:05.843 --> 01:27:08.645]  Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate.
[01:27:09.798 --> 01:27:14.760]  and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.021]  These companies must do more than take down one website.
[01:27:19.021 --> 01:27:21.863]  The survival of our democracy depends on it.
[01:27:21.863 --> 01:27:24.604]  What an Orwellian statement.
[01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:26.824]  And then it goes on.
[01:27:26.824 --> 01:27:30.506]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[01:27:30.506 --> 01:27:32.567]  Reason.com.
[01:27:32.567 --> 01:27:37.428]  A leaked memo circulating among Senate Democrats contains a host of bonkers and authoritarian proposals.
[01:27:37.428 --> 01:27:38.749]  Really, it's not bonkers, it's working.
[01:27:39.827 --> 01:27:45.629]  For regulating digital platforms purportedly as a way to get tough on Russian bots and fake news.
[01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:46.949]  They define their enemy as that.
[01:27:46.949 --> 01:27:47.930]  Where'd your dad go?
[01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:48.750]  Where'd mom go?
[01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.130]  He was fake news.
[01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:54.752]  To save America's trust in our institutions, democracy, free press, and markets.
[01:27:54.752 --> 01:27:58.013]  They mean the whole crumbling, lying, shycom, globalist funded edifice.
[01:27:59.258 --> 01:28:00.719]  The Robert Barron edifice.
[01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:13.651]  It suggests we need unprecedented and undemocratic government intervention into online press and markets, including comprehensive GDPR-like data protection legislation to be selectively enforced.
[01:28:13.651 --> 01:28:15.373]  Of the sort enacted in the EU.
[01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.054]  That's all just selectively enforced.
[01:28:17.054 --> 01:28:22.139]  Titled, Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms.
[01:28:22.139 --> 01:28:24.762]  The draft policy paper penned by Senator Mark Warner
[01:28:26.413 --> 01:28:32.697]  Yes, the Russians.
[01:28:32.697 --> 01:28:34.178]  They're the ones banning our press.
[01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:37.220]  They're the ones trying to bankrupt the economy to teach those dirty... No, no!
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:40.462]  That's HBO and Bill Maher.
[01:28:40.462 --> 01:28:41.662]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:41.662 --> 01:28:43.003]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:43.003 --> 01:28:43.984]  Stay angry about this.

[01:28:44.624 --> 01:28:45.225]  It's a war.
[01:28:45.225 --> 01:28:46.465]  It's on in the midterms.

[01:29:27.176 --> 01:29:31.058]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.058 --> 01:29:31.658]  What if I told
[01:29:31.718 --> 01:29:31.958]  I think so.
[01:29:58.243 --> 01:30:04.507]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[01:30:32.571 --> 01:30:39.479]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:46.883]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:30:46.883 --> 01:30:47.083]  It's you!
[01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:09.312]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:18.081]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:31:18.081 --> 01:31:22.626]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:31:22.626 --> 01:31:24.087]  You are the info war.
[01:31:24.087 --> 01:31:27.610]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:29.732]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[01:31:57.788 --> 01:32:08.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.463]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.463 --> 01:32:13.326]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.326 --> 01:32:14.828]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.828 --> 01:32:14.948]  It's
[01:32:15.128 --> 01:32:15.388]  I think?
[01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:50.236]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.236 --> 01:32:53.538]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:53.538 --> 01:33:00.701]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:03.303]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.555 --> 01:33:22.344]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[01:33:22.344 --> 01:33:27.670]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:29.352]  Curfew is now in place.
[01:33:29.352 --> 01:33:30.474]  Return to your homes.
[01:33:37.865 --> 01:33:42.708]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:42.708 --> 01:33:49.491]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:55.855]  Alright, every 30 minutes we're learning that we've been banned off of our WebChimp email we've been using for a decade.
[01:33:55.855 --> 01:33:58.696]  Make sure you follow all the rules on that.
[01:33:58.696 --> 01:34:05.980]  Sprout Social, that we've been using since 2012, for all of our social media to coordinate that, they just banned us 10 minutes ago.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:14.643]  It's all pouring in right now, in a military globalist test.
[01:34:14.643 --> 01:34:18.225]  Chi-Com coordinated, it's all coming out in the news.
[01:34:18.225 --> 01:34:23.567]  Allied with the Democrats and Silicon Valley, even Politico admits Silicon Valley's run by the Chinese Communists.
[01:34:23.567 --> 01:34:25.248]  They're making their move.
[01:34:25.248 --> 01:34:30.510]  I mean, iPhones won't send out Taiwanese emojis until there was a big stink.
[01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:32.751]  China's in the news, threatening right now.
[01:34:34.369 --> 01:34:38.533]  Uh, to take over Apple because it's state run and we get in a trade war with them.
[01:34:38.533 --> 01:34:41.076]  It's all unfolding.
[01:34:41.076 --> 01:34:54.349]  And in the middle of this, you've got the Democrats on CNN and MSNBC whining and bitching and complaining over and over again, saying Trump says we're the enemy of the people.
[01:34:54.349 --> 01:34:55.730]  He's trying to shut us down.
[01:34:55.730 --> 01:34:57.592]  He's hurting us.
[01:34:57.592 --> 01:34:58.653]  He's not calling for shutting you down.
[01:35:00.523 --> 01:35:08.925]  He's exposing you and your incredible lies and your leakers trying to violate national security and sabotage the country.
[01:35:08.925 --> 01:35:13.326]  And then meanwhile, CNN's everywhere saying he hadn't been taking off iPhone and Android apps.
[01:35:13.326 --> 01:35:18.327]  And CNN is admittedly contacting every service we might be on.
[01:35:18.327 --> 01:35:19.947]  So is the Huffington Post, so is BuzzFeed.
[01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:20.607]  They brag about it.
[01:35:23.888 --> 01:35:33.913]  Reaching out to every service we've got, like Nazis knocking the windows out of Jewish businesses in 1935, to shut us down and put us in a ghetto.
[01:35:33.913 --> 01:35:40.777]  They've kicked me, even though I never really signed myself up, I don't know who did it, I think one of the salesmen did, like 15 years ago, to LinkedIn.
[01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:48.981]  I'm banned off LinkedIn, so if they were able to bankrupt me and I tried to get a job at Baskin-Robbins or at McDonald's, I couldn't.
[01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:51.643]  I mean, we laugh at this, but these people are authoritarians.
[01:35:53.587 --> 01:36:00.668]  So Instagram has left us up there for now, but Pinterest took us down, and they're all attacking Twitter.
[01:36:00.668 --> 01:36:01.709]  Why are you on Twitter?
[01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:04.469]  Why are you on Twitter?
[01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:09.990]  Because Congress showed a little interest in the shadowbanning of Twitter, so Twitter knows it's being looked at.
[01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:14.911]  Congress couldn't believe the last few hearings that they didn't care about Google or Apple or any of it, so that was a green light.
[01:36:14.911 --> 01:36:18.972]  So Trump needs to take antitrust action on all of this now.
[01:36:22.093 --> 01:36:23.914]  But just think about that hypocrisy.
[01:36:23.914 --> 01:36:39.627]  I saw an article on CNN, reportedly in 2012, the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, asked someone working there to delete two articles that were unfavorable about one of his real estate partners.
[01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.809]  Well, how do you even know that's true from some deranged leftist Trump arranger?
[01:36:42.809 --> 01:36:45.491]  But, how do you know the articles weren't accurate?
[01:36:45.491 --> 01:36:46.092]  How do you know?
[01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:46.972]  Who knows?
[01:36:46.972 --> 01:36:50.075]  He was the owner of the New York Observer, and
[01:36:51.559 --> 01:36:57.143]  Deleting two articles, CNN says is a huge journalistic scandal.
[01:36:57.143 --> 01:36:59.705]  Because those were critical of somebody.
[01:36:59.705 --> 01:37:04.909]  They just got 35,000 of our videos deleted, critical of CNN and others.
[01:37:04.909 --> 01:37:12.194]  So it's a big story that, oh my God, six years ago, maybe Kushner may have deleted something with no proof.
[01:37:12.194 --> 01:37:18.999]  And it says in the article, after we saw Trump attack the free press and realized he was a Nazi, I as a developer had to go public and fight him.
[01:37:20.171 --> 01:37:23.053]  Because what we're doing is so bad.
[01:37:23.053 --> 01:37:24.373]  These people are amazing.
[01:37:24.373 --> 01:37:28.596]  They'll sit there on the same segment going, shut Alex Jones down, he's hate, he's evil.
[01:37:28.596 --> 01:37:32.318]  Indoctrinating their viewers into upside-down logic.
[01:37:32.318 --> 01:37:35.360]  Dyslogic, dyscordia, mental illness.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.081]  And then next, did you see?
[01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:40.623]  Trump called us the enemy and said we lie.
[01:37:40.623 --> 01:37:42.304]  That's fake news.
[01:37:42.304 --> 01:37:43.725]  Calling us fake news is violent.
[01:37:43.725 --> 01:37:44.685]  He's fake news.
[01:37:44.685 --> 01:37:45.566]  He's a traitor.
[01:37:45.566 --> 01:37:47.707]  So Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com who helped write
[01:37:48.973 --> 01:37:54.116]  The big report he quarterbacked at was gotten the president of web censorship and more.
[01:37:54.116 --> 01:38:02.061]  All hell's breaking loose and there's a big backlash but not big enough because they're trying to economically de-platform me from everything.
[01:38:02.061 --> 01:38:04.403]  They're trying it with the NRA as well.
[01:38:04.403 --> 01:38:05.904]  This is totally criminal.
[01:38:05.904 --> 01:38:08.866]  You run Real.Video that carries a lot of our stuff.
[01:38:08.866 --> 01:38:10.527]  We're feverishly uploading there.
[01:38:10.527 --> 01:38:13.128]  That's really taking off and exploding and that's the answer.
[01:38:13.128 --> 01:38:15.650]  It's an exodus from these guys but Apple
[01:38:16.983 --> 01:38:25.474]  And CNN, MSNBC, these media outlets are all lobbying other outlets and other services to blacklist this as well in a test.
[01:38:25.474 --> 01:38:29.680]  And I think Mike, the big news is, I want to get your breakdown on this in the next segment.
[01:38:30.834 --> 01:38:33.176]  is to shut everybody down ahead of the midterms.
[01:38:33.176 --> 01:38:34.477]  Something big's coming.
[01:38:34.477 --> 01:38:38.341]  They want to be able to blacklist whole groups where people just hear blacklist, blacklist.
[01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:40.603]  Everybody's platform ahead of something big.
[01:38:40.603 --> 01:38:46.789]  They don't want us to be able to communicate when they put their people in the streets, when they make their Civil War move they've been talking about.
[01:38:46.789 --> 01:38:47.689]  I mean, this is it.
[01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:49.311]  We've been talking about it for months.
[01:38:49.311 --> 01:38:50.612]  We predicted this would happen.
[01:38:50.612 --> 01:38:51.553]  Everybody heard it and saw it.
[01:38:51.553 --> 01:38:52.414]  This is it, I think, Mike.
[01:38:53.473 --> 01:38:55.575]  Well, this is modeled after the Communist China.
[01:38:55.575 --> 01:38:59.079]  You nailed it in yesterday's broadcast and today's broadcast.
[01:38:59.079 --> 01:39:02.163]  This is a blueprint, and first they did this in China.
[01:39:02.163 --> 01:39:10.172]  For example, in China, you can't see my website, you can't see your website, you know, because we talk about liberty and freedom or Falun Gong or Tiananmen Square or whatever.
[01:39:10.772 --> 01:39:21.458]  So that model is now being applied in the United States and remember it was a coordinated multi-platform collusion attack on you over the last 36 hours.
[01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:22.759]  This was coordinated.
[01:39:22.759 --> 01:39:24.520]  This is racketeering.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.741]  That's why I said in my video
[01:39:26.482 --> 01:39:33.885]  That I'm calling for a RICO Act investigation and potential prosecution of these tech giants for racketeering.
[01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:34.826]  This is a racket.
[01:39:34.826 --> 01:39:37.847]  It violates your constitutionally protected rights.
[01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:39.267]  It violates your human rights.
[01:39:39.267 --> 01:39:43.229]  This is an assault on the civil rights of all Americans.
[01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:54.274]  And I believe that what we need today is a kind of like a civil rights uprising, a peaceful one, that calls for basic human dignity to be respected, that the freedom of speech is a basic
[01:39:54.654 --> 01:40:01.540]  Human right even in the spirit of the 1960s civil rights uprising by African-Americans and Martin Luther King jr.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:15.692]  Today this censorship this has become the civil rights issue of our time and keep in mind to Alex that they have never not yet to this moment have they told you why exactly you were banned they can't cite
[01:40:16.232 --> 01:40:18.573]  The actual videos, the actual snippets.
[01:40:18.573 --> 01:40:20.594]  They can't say who made the decision.
[01:40:20.594 --> 01:40:26.476]  They can't present evidence against you, and they won't allow you to present any evidence in your defense.
[01:40:26.476 --> 01:40:32.999]  And what they've done through CNN and other fake news media outlets is spread hatred about Alex Jones.
[01:40:32.999 --> 01:40:40.502]  And then this hatred is invoked by MailChimp and others to say, well, we're going to de-platform Alex Jones because we just hate Alex Jones.
[01:40:40.502 --> 01:40:41.303]  And then they say,
[01:40:42.023 --> 01:40:48.632]  That they're banning you because you're spreading hate while they're actually the ones engaged in the hatred and the censorship.
[01:40:48.632 --> 01:40:53.218]  And by the way, I want to show people today, I'm glad you mentioned the emails we sent out, the last ones to our listeners.
[01:40:53.218 --> 01:40:54.580]  We're going to get a new system obviously.
[01:40:56.089 --> 01:40:57.669]  It was all like, hey, we're being censored.
[01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:58.590]  Come hear the love.
[01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:02.591]  Black, white, old, young, whatever, gay, straight, come here.
[01:41:02.591 --> 01:41:04.451]  We just love America and free market.
[01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:09.413]  We want to stop the chi-coms that kill Buddhists and Christians and everybody for no reason.
[01:41:09.413 --> 01:41:10.233]  They're the ones manipulating.
[01:41:10.233 --> 01:41:15.914]  And now it's in the news today that China is threatening to take over Apple, which is moved there if Trump doesn't back down.
[01:41:15.914 --> 01:41:19.095]  That's how crazy this has gotten that we're forcing them.
[01:41:19.095 --> 01:41:21.016]  I told my dad a few weeks ago, privately, he said, son,
[01:41:22.196 --> 01:41:25.418]  I know what you're saying is legal and lawful, and I agree with you, but you're really escalating things.
[01:41:25.418 --> 01:41:27.279]  And I said, I've got to do it for the country and the kids.
[01:41:27.279 --> 01:41:34.524]  And he said, let me guess, you're trying to not get yourself banned, but pushing it because you know they're already going to do it, but you want to force the issue now instead of later.
[01:41:34.524 --> 01:41:35.644]  And I said, exactly.
[01:41:35.644 --> 01:41:38.286]  So that's what I've done on purpose.
[01:41:38.286 --> 01:41:40.227]  It's not to do things that violate the rules.
[01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:48.812]  I just escalated it to force them out in the open and ran some PSYOPs on them from behind the scenes when they sent an intelligence operative in here.
[01:41:48.812 --> 01:41:51.714]  And so they took the bait, but now it's up to the people.
[01:41:52.631 --> 01:41:57.918]  Because you understand, this isn't a war simply on Alex Jones or Infowars or Paul Jones.
[01:41:57.918 --> 01:41:59.800]  I'm just the first domino.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.661]  That's right.
[01:42:00.661 --> 01:42:03.765]  The tech giants have declared war on human freedom.
[01:42:04.389 --> 01:42:08.751]  This is a war on humanity, and it will impact everyone.
[01:42:08.751 --> 01:42:11.352]  And remember when the left used to be pro-free speech?
[01:42:11.352 --> 01:42:12.112]  Remember that?
[01:42:12.112 --> 01:42:13.453]  It wasn't that long ago.
[01:42:13.453 --> 01:42:27.178]  And now they are celebrating the authoritarian censorship, not realizing that that weaponization of technology could one day very easily be turned against them to silence minority voices, to silence anyone.
[01:42:27.658 --> 01:42:31.722]  That is on the enemy's list of the tech giants, whoever is in control at that time.
[01:42:31.722 --> 01:42:35.785]  It's a dangerous precedent, and they've declared war on humanity.
[01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:36.365]  That's right.
[01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:39.588]  What the globals really believe is they're creating replicant stock.
[01:42:39.588 --> 01:42:44.852]  In the future, they're going to breed everybody and just have humans for certain jobs, because we're good biological androids in their view.
[01:42:44.852 --> 01:42:49.916]  But they wanted to come from natural stock, so that's what they're basically doing, and that's the view of what we are.
[01:42:49.916 --> 01:42:51.978]  And that's why their robots can't replace us.
[01:42:51.978 --> 01:42:53.779]  They see us as the ultimate android.
[01:42:53.779 --> 01:42:54.200]  We'll be back.
[01:43:01.138 --> 01:43:06.863]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:06.863 --> 01:43:14.729]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.729 --> 01:43:17.892]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:43:18.072 --> 01:43:26.117]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.

[01:46:04.454 --> 01:46:06.896]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:06.896 --> 01:46:08.057]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.057 --> 01:46:09.678]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:09.678 --> 01:46:12.900]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.021]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.021 --> 01:46:17.203]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.

[01:46:20.925 --> 01:46:21.085]  I think?

[01:47:11.155 --> 01:47:16.101]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:47:16.101 --> 01:47:22.490]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:24.913]  We now take you live to the battle for free speech.
[01:47:26.653 --> 01:47:34.615]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:37.375]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.375 --> 01:47:41.896]  The battle is raging for the future of Western civilization and basic free speech.
[01:47:41.896 --> 01:47:45.857]  We're on the front lines, at the core of the main fight.
[01:47:45.857 --> 01:47:46.637]  Would you like to know more?
[01:47:46.637 --> 01:47:51.898]  Well then keep tuning in and please spread the live links to others.
[01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:52.238]  Alright.
[01:47:55.126 --> 01:47:56.347]  Roll back to Mike Adams here in a second.
[01:47:56.347 --> 01:47:57.667]  He'll be with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:47:57.667 --> 01:47:59.368]  Then I have several other guests joining us.
[01:47:59.368 --> 01:48:02.129]  The head of GABS coming on about all the censorship that's happening there.
[01:48:02.129 --> 01:48:09.373]  Andrew Torbath and Roger Stone's got big breaking news about who they're deposing and what's happening in the whole Russiagate situation.
[01:48:09.373 --> 01:48:15.796]  But when I had the New York Times talk to me Friday, they were stalking my family custody situation.
[01:48:15.796 --> 01:48:20.798]  And when I continued to have my kids and beat the fake filings, no coverage.
[01:48:22.034 --> 01:48:29.876]  And when I said that I was waiving the fees, even though the Sandy Hook families are being funded to sue me, just take the high road, they said that I was not waiving the fees and suing them.
[01:48:29.876 --> 01:48:33.517]  Just lies, lies, lies, is what these folks do.
[01:48:33.517 --> 01:48:39.699]  And they've already been caught lying so much, they've just escalated the lying because they're not going to give up.
[01:48:39.699 --> 01:48:43.160]  That said, there's something that can stand in the way of what they're doing, and something they hate.
[01:48:44.147 --> 01:48:56.311]  That's why they're trying to de-platform us, trying to stop us from emailing, kicking us off all these systems now, Sprout Social, not letting us use that even though we've been paying to use the service for six years.
[01:48:56.311 --> 01:49:04.594]  And of course, I am going to have to sue somebody just so when the next person does this de-platforming, like I'm trying to buy a bus ticket, they go, sorry, you're Alex Jones.
[01:49:04.594 --> 01:49:06.975]  Or I'm trying to buy bread at the store, sorry, you're Alex Jones.
[01:49:06.975 --> 01:49:11.176]  Or I'm trying to, that's what this has now reached.
[01:49:11.176 --> 01:49:12.917]  So it's come down to that.
[01:49:14.278 --> 01:49:17.339]  So we're going to have to take action very, very soon.
[01:49:17.339 --> 01:49:24.042]  And I haven't decided who we're going to have to litigate against right now, but it's got to be done because it's just kind of out of control.
[01:49:24.042 --> 01:49:27.404]  But the biggest thing you can do is understand we're fighting for all your rights.
[01:49:27.404 --> 01:49:28.984]  And we're trying to take the country back.
[01:49:28.984 --> 01:49:31.406]  It's an information war and people thought it'd be easy.
[01:49:31.406 --> 01:49:32.986]  It's easy when people take action.
[01:49:32.986 --> 01:49:34.347]  It's not easy when people fall back to sleep.
[01:49:34.347 --> 01:49:40.429]  And I know you're not asleep, but a lot of you are tuning in for the first time to hear what is it that's so horrible this guy says?
[01:49:40.429 --> 01:49:41.410]  Why are they so scared of him?
[01:49:43.029 --> 01:49:46.091]  The globalists were selling the country out, but shy comms are involved.
[01:49:46.091 --> 01:49:47.211]  It's all coming out now.
[01:49:47.211 --> 01:49:51.874]  They know that if people listen, if the White House listen, it's over for them.
[01:49:51.874 --> 01:50:03.200]  They're trying to steal the midterms right now, so the biggest thing you can do is commit to get great products we have, all of them are game changing, and support the broadcast.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.922]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:06.922 --> 01:50:07.783]  We're under attack.
[01:50:08.806 --> 01:50:10.168]  Our products are great.
[01:50:10.168 --> 01:50:10.728]  Fish oil.
[01:50:10.728 --> 01:50:12.190]  Our clean, high-quality fish oil.
[01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:14.452]  Highest quality out there.
[01:50:14.452 --> 01:50:16.655]  Wild Harvest is in the north, and we've got the krill oil.
[01:50:16.655 --> 01:50:18.136]  We've got Honor Roll for kids.
[01:50:18.136 --> 01:50:24.864]  It's a smaller caplet, but the type of oil is just for the brain mainly, where the regular fish oil is good for the brain and the heart and the rest of the body.
[01:50:24.864 --> 01:50:25.384]  It's all there.
[01:50:26.363 --> 01:50:27.604]  40% off when you get them together.
[01:50:27.604 --> 01:50:29.765]  25% off when you get them individually.
[01:50:29.765 --> 01:50:30.966]  They're a two-month supply.
[01:50:30.966 --> 01:50:31.947]  Highest quality.
[01:50:31.947 --> 01:50:33.768]  You're not going to find a better deal.
[01:50:33.768 --> 01:50:34.428]  Right to use.
[01:50:34.428 --> 01:50:36.410]  Sign up for auto-ship for stuff you want to reorder.
[01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:38.251]  Additional 10% off free shipping.
[01:50:38.251 --> 01:50:39.712]  Order for $50 or more.
[01:50:39.712 --> 01:50:41.473]  And it's you funding us that angers them.
[01:50:41.473 --> 01:50:42.894]  The idea of a new economy.
[01:50:42.894 --> 01:50:44.415]  The idea of something that isn't a monopoly.
[01:50:44.415 --> 01:50:52.000]  So, please, for the First Amendment and your own health and your own future, check out InfoWareStore.com and get some vitamin B12, Secret 12.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.761]  Get some vitamin D3.
[01:50:53.761 --> 01:50:56.163]  Get some high-quality coffee.
[01:50:57.464 --> 01:51:00.827]  The Wake of America coffee that's from Chiapas, it's so high quality.
[01:51:00.827 --> 01:51:03.349]  Whatever the product is, get a t-shirt.
[01:51:03.349 --> 01:51:10.154]  Go look at all the George Washington in his prime with a musket and a hatchet, great shirt.
[01:51:10.154 --> 01:51:15.559]  Go get the I am the Resistance shirt, established 1776.
[01:51:15.559 --> 01:51:17.040]  All these shirts are great.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.005]  Reelect 45, that's how you fund the operation and how you spread the word and how you meet like-minded people, but even bigger than that.
[01:51:25.347 --> 01:51:29.890]  It takes care of you and your family, and it helps you stand in the way of these globalists.
[01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:33.333]  So, please, think about InfoWorks today, financially.
[01:51:33.333 --> 01:51:38.076]  We had a lot of funding come in yesterday, but that's kind of the initial phase of being blown up.
[01:51:38.076 --> 01:51:43.480]  There's a lot of... It's like at the end of the movie, The Thing, the remake in the 80s, and they're like, yeah, we're not dead yet.
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.342]  The fire's got the temperature of the camp up.
[01:51:46.342 --> 01:51:48.043]  We're going to be frozen solid in about two hours.
[01:51:51.187 --> 01:51:52.749]  Again, for my ego, I'm not worried about it.
[01:51:52.749 --> 01:51:53.611]  I asked for this.
[01:51:53.611 --> 01:51:54.553]  I picked this fight.
[01:51:54.553 --> 01:51:55.614]  I did this.
[01:51:55.614 --> 01:52:00.543]  It's just that I wanted him to jump the shark, so I kind of thumped him in the nose a little bit.
[01:52:00.543 --> 01:52:02.025]  Not really on air, but behind the scenes.
[01:52:03.553 --> 01:52:11.297]  And we, there is some internal stuff from the Washington Post and the New York Times coming out, but I really, really pulled a number on them.
[01:52:11.297 --> 01:52:13.818]  And so they are flipping out right now.
[01:52:13.818 --> 01:52:20.001]  And we've got a bunch of stuff to really get the beehive going, because I believe in you, and I believe their attempts at censorship and all this are going to blow up in their face.
[01:52:21.366 --> 01:52:26.828]  Now when people are listening and wondering why, I say, hey, out of all these voices, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:52:26.828 --> 01:52:33.991]  No matter how they're censoring us, Infowars.com forward slash show, we're always going to have ways right there until God knows what.
[01:52:33.991 --> 01:52:38.713]  But getting back to that, Mike, I want to bring this up now in the next segment, how we counter it.
[01:52:38.713 --> 01:52:41.714]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, a great patriot at the tip of the spear fighting this.
[01:52:41.714 --> 01:52:47.176]  He's launched his real video site that's got millions and millions of views a day now, doing a great job to counter all this.
[01:52:47.176 --> 01:52:48.157]  He saw it coming.
[01:52:48.157 --> 01:52:50.418]  We'll talk about that some too, but just briefly,
[01:52:51.337 --> 01:52:55.200]  Stelter and everybody at the talking point is Trump's going to get us killed when they're the ones calling for violence.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.984]  And now they're censoring us and now they, I think they have their own bots out making threats against themselves.
[01:52:59.984 --> 01:53:06.390]  There could be a false flag against the media in response to my censorship to legitimize censorship and go after Trump.
[01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:07.311]  I'm really concerned.
[01:53:07.311 --> 01:53:10.113]  So there's an article by Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[01:53:11.454 --> 01:53:14.957]  MSM fueling, Nazi-style censorship to trigger violence.
[01:53:14.957 --> 01:53:17.299]  Don't take debate, just say no to violence.
[01:53:17.299 --> 01:53:21.042]  Censorship is an act of desperation by those who are already losing.
[01:53:21.042 --> 01:53:25.486]  As I see these polls out, 47% of Republicans want to just shut down the mainstream media.
[01:53:25.486 --> 01:53:28.048]  Well, just shut off the CHICOM funding.
[01:53:28.048 --> 01:53:32.271]  Just indict them for the racketeering and the intimidation of other businesses.
[01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:34.293]  Don't shut them down because they're media.
[01:53:34.293 --> 01:53:37.595]  Just indict their asses and that'll turn around things real quickly.
[01:53:37.595 --> 01:53:38.056]  Mike Adams.
[01:53:39.537 --> 01:53:46.705]  Well, look, it strikes me that this is not just an information war against you, but also an economic war.
[01:53:46.705 --> 01:53:48.087]  There's economic sabotage.
[01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:50.750]  I mean, you think about CNN calling for you to be deplatformed.
[01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:53.450]  It's a form of economic sabotage.
[01:53:53.450 --> 01:54:03.738]  This is like they're targeting your infrastructure in the same way that an invading military force would target bridges and target roads and target telecommunications.
[01:54:03.738 --> 01:54:07.241]  They're targeting your mail chimp, your mail delivery.
[01:54:07.241 --> 01:54:10.203]  They're targeting your store products they targeted last year.
[01:54:10.203 --> 01:54:12.885]  They're targeting your ability to speak.
[01:54:12.885 --> 01:54:16.208]  And even think about right now, the NRA is suing the state of New York
[01:54:16.929 --> 01:54:24.053]  Over the fact that the financial institutions were ordered by the Governor of New York to deny services to the NRA.
[01:54:24.053 --> 01:54:27.055]  You know, insurance services and basic financial services.
[01:54:27.055 --> 01:54:31.677]  The truth is, none of us can exist in a society if we don't have access to basic infrastructure.
[01:54:31.677 --> 01:54:32.718]  I mean, what's next?
[01:54:32.718 --> 01:54:39.001]  Is your electric company going to come to you and say, well, we don't want our electricity to be used to spread hate, right?
[01:54:39.001 --> 01:54:39.462]  And then what?
[01:54:39.462 --> 01:54:40.702]  They're going to cut off your electricity?
[01:54:40.702 --> 01:54:41.923]  They're going to cut off your water?
[01:54:41.923 --> 01:54:43.324]  They're going to cut off your bandwidth?
[01:54:43.744 --> 01:54:45.505]  You know, this has got to stop.
[01:54:45.505 --> 01:54:59.228]  We need legislation right now, and maybe backed by executive orders in the meantime, that protects our right to exist in a tech society and to communicate in a tech society.
[01:54:59.228 --> 01:55:02.929]  And that's what they're trying to do, is destroy your very existence.
[01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:04.770]  They're trying to memory hole your very existence.
[01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:06.010]  I don't
[01:55:21.455 --> 01:55:27.178]  I mean, I understand that they're being told by a bunch of yes-men everything's okay and they're not giving speeches, but this is outrageous.
[01:55:27.178 --> 01:55:28.799]  This is the big campaign issue.
[01:55:28.799 --> 01:55:30.259]  This is campaign meddling.
[01:55:30.259 --> 01:55:32.240]  This is classic rackets.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.121]  This is classic curtailing.
[01:55:34.121 --> 01:55:36.002]  This is classic Nazi gulag.
[01:55:36.002 --> 01:55:37.743]  This is it!
[01:55:37.743 --> 01:55:39.264]  And it's a blueprint from China.
[01:55:39.264 --> 01:55:48.608]  Remember the social scoring system where in China you can't ride public transportation, you can't go to a college, you can't get a loan if you don't fit the social score
[01:55:49.286 --> 01:55:52.889]  That's put down on you by the government, and that score requires what?
[01:55:52.889 --> 01:55:55.872]  Absolute obedience to the narratives of the government.
[01:55:55.872 --> 01:56:00.036]  That's exactly what Facebook is doing today, YouTube, Google, all of them.
[01:56:00.036 --> 01:56:08.544]  They're saying that if you go outside the bounds of the official approved narrative, you effectively have a low social score.
[01:56:08.544 --> 01:56:11.366]  You will now be denied access to basic services.
[01:56:11.366 --> 01:56:13.008]  And I just saw the headline a few months ago!
[01:56:13.388 --> 01:56:17.371]  Where CNN said, oh look, China just didn't let 11 million people fly on flights.
[01:56:17.371 --> 01:56:19.033]  11 million flights.
[01:56:19.033 --> 01:56:20.674]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has a name.
[01:56:20.674 --> 01:56:23.176]  It's called the Mark of the Beast.
[01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:24.177]  It's actually happening.
[01:56:25.151 --> 01:56:26.072]  Yeah, I mean, what's next?
[01:56:26.072 --> 01:56:33.977]  Is CNN going to call for your driver's license to be revoked in Texas so that you can't drive because you might commit hate on the roads?
[01:56:33.977 --> 01:56:41.082]  I mean, and besides, they still have not pointed out what you did wrong in any of your videos or any of your articles.
[01:56:41.082 --> 01:56:42.443]  They can't point to it.
[01:56:42.443 --> 01:56:45.565]  And besides, CNN deliberately fakes the news.
[01:56:45.565 --> 01:56:52.429]  They're constantly faking or twisting or distorting or editing out things they don't want you to see.
[01:56:52.429 --> 01:56:54.691]  CNN is legitimately fake news.
[01:56:55.331 --> 01:57:01.257]  And yet they claim that only they alone have a First Amendment right, but you don't have a First Amendment right, Alex.
[01:57:01.257 --> 01:57:03.439]  And that means that none of us do.
[01:57:03.439 --> 01:57:03.980]  That's the thing.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.722]  You're the canary in the coal mine.
[01:57:05.722 --> 01:57:07.043]  Iris, let me ask you this question.
[01:57:07.043 --> 01:57:08.444]  We got a break here.
[01:57:08.444 --> 01:57:09.505]  Start answering now if you can.
[01:57:09.505 --> 01:57:13.469]  And we'll talk about what do we do to stop this, but next hour is critical.
[01:57:13.469 --> 01:57:16.112]  They're making their move clearly against Trump in America right now.
[01:57:16.112 --> 01:57:16.913]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:57:19.834 --> 01:57:20.775]  Well, yeah.
[01:57:20.775 --> 01:57:22.096]  Something big is coming up.
[01:57:22.096 --> 01:57:24.558]  And they want you silenced so that you can't react to it.
[01:57:24.558 --> 01:57:28.802]  And they want the beta test, where they then go, and now here's the new guy to ban.
[01:57:28.802 --> 01:57:30.223]  Everybody wolf-packs them.
[01:57:30.223 --> 01:57:32.104]  And then here's the new guy, just like Nazi Germany.
[01:57:32.104 --> 01:57:33.466]  They'd say, brown shirts!
[01:57:33.466 --> 01:57:34.186]  Brown shirts!
[01:57:34.186 --> 01:57:34.506]  Get them!
[01:57:34.506 --> 01:57:37.289]  They demonize you first, and then they de-platform you second.
[01:57:37.289 --> 01:57:40.111]  And only a few people like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul get this.
[01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:44.615]  And I gotta say, Trump, I'm very proud of him in many ways, but I'm getting disappointed in some.

[01:59:51.207 --> 01:59:53.848]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:59.301 --> 02:00:12.892]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.892 --> 02:00:14.813]  All right, Mike Adams is with us on our two segments.
[02:00:14.813 --> 02:00:17.775]  We've got the head of Gab, Rod and Sean, going to start the next segment.
[02:00:17.775 --> 02:00:19.737]  I've got to say, Breitbart's been getting it, too.
[02:00:19.737 --> 02:00:23.900]  We appreciate Breitbart being pro-freedom of speech and not wanting to slit their own throats.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.784]  Zero transparency, six questions that tech giants refuse to answer about the Infowars ban.
[02:00:31.001 --> 02:00:33.081]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:00:33.081 --> 02:00:35.942]  A lot of people are sociopaths, and they're all about themselves.
[02:00:35.942 --> 02:00:38.442]  So they think, why are you making this sacrifice?
[02:00:38.442 --> 02:00:39.242]  How are you doing?
[02:00:39.242 --> 02:00:41.123]  I mean, I'm worried about the country.
[02:00:41.123 --> 02:00:42.203]  I'm doing great.
[02:00:42.203 --> 02:00:45.824]  I've been trying to get them to, you know, come out in the open and admit their plans.
[02:00:45.824 --> 02:00:48.604]  And now we've got the Democrats saying they want to censor all conservatives.
[02:00:48.604 --> 02:00:49.784]  They want draconian control.
[02:00:49.784 --> 02:00:50.604]  This is outrageous.
[02:00:50.604 --> 02:00:53.665]  But Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com.
[02:00:53.665 --> 02:00:56.645]  Trump's done great about saying mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
[02:00:56.645 --> 02:00:57.385]  They're globalists.
[02:00:57.385 --> 02:00:58.466]  They're working for foreign powers.
[02:00:58.466 --> 02:01:00.066]  But the fact that
[02:01:01.297 --> 02:01:02.697]  He's gotten your report, I know.
[02:01:02.697 --> 02:01:10.199]  I was talking to some folks at the campaign this morning, and China's openly setting up censorship systems with Google.
[02:01:10.199 --> 02:01:11.839]  Apple's moved there.
[02:01:11.839 --> 02:01:14.820]  Dianne Feinstein's been caught being a Chicom agent.
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:18.821]  This is the big issue they're moving against, is Trump needs to act now.
[02:01:18.821 --> 02:01:22.802]  Instead, they've had hearings where the Republicans literally act like they've got 70 IQs.
[02:01:25.148 --> 02:01:34.953]  Well, the problem right now is that the tech giants lobbied for a law known as the CDA, the Communications Decency Act, specifically Section 230, many, many years ago.
[02:01:34.953 --> 02:01:39.716]  And that law protected them from, you know, any kind of liability related to free speech.
[02:01:39.716 --> 02:01:46.740]  And there's some aspects of that law that are good, but it also allows them to engage in discriminatory censorship against people for political reasons.
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:49.101]  Yeah, we need amendments to that law right now on the Internet Bill of Rights.
[02:01:49.101 --> 02:01:49.922]  That's right, exactly.
[02:01:50.462 --> 02:01:55.424]  This has to be legislatively attacked or attacked from a regulatory point of view.
[02:01:55.424 --> 02:01:57.465]  You know, I've mentioned RICO Act violations.
[02:01:57.465 --> 02:02:03.388]  Well, how about to protect the 2018 Right to Free Speech Emergency Act, saying stop censoring conservative voices?
[02:02:04.107 --> 02:02:14.133]  Exactly, or the Federal Trade Commission could go after Facebook right now for monopoly behavior, or the FEC for election fraud or attempts to steal the upcoming midterm elections.
[02:02:14.133 --> 02:02:18.695]  There are a number of regulatory agencies that could take action right now if they wanted to.
[02:02:18.695 --> 02:02:23.858]  Trump issued an executive order to protect, say, something like an Internet Bill of Rights for the people.
[02:02:24.538 --> 02:02:35.312]  Sadly, a lot of lower court judges, they believe they have judicial power to override the president, even though constitutionally they don't, but they try to assert that, and so far they've been successful in doing that.
[02:02:36.084 --> 02:02:54.245]  And ultimately, by the way, Alex, strategically, this comes down to getting Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court so that whatever actions escalate to the High Court are heard by Kavanaugh and, you know, others, Gorsuch and others, so that we have a chance to reassert the First Amendment across not just
[02:02:55.256 --> 02:02:59.439]  You know, sidewalks and public speech, but online speech.
[02:02:59.439 --> 02:03:00.741]  That's where this has to go, Alex.
[02:03:00.741 --> 02:03:05.945]  And I think now, because of you and what's happened to you, it's a wake-up call to everyone.
[02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:19.616]  I think there's a rush now for people to say, wait a second, if they can ban Alex Jones, I mean, I've heard a lot of people say they don't agree with you on everything, but if they can ban Alex Jones, they could ban us, or him, or her, or anyone.
[02:03:19.616 --> 02:03:21.117]  And that's the truth.
[02:03:21.117 --> 02:03:22.658]  I don't agree with a straw man.
[02:03:23.419 --> 02:03:24.703]  That mainstream media put out.
[02:03:24.703 --> 02:03:28.655]  I mean CNN was airing stuff with me that were like two second clips edited together last night.
[02:03:29.670 --> 02:03:30.310]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:35.372]  I mean, the portrayal of you in the media is utterly false and completely distorted.
[02:03:35.372 --> 02:03:38.233]  So people don't even really know what you stand for.
[02:03:38.233 --> 02:03:43.474]  I put out a tweet today that said, hey, reminding everybody Alex Jones is pro-organic food.
[02:03:43.474 --> 02:03:44.615]  He's against pesticides.
[02:03:44.615 --> 02:03:46.135]  He's against herbicides.
[02:03:46.135 --> 02:03:48.376]  He's against the toxic GMOs.
[02:03:48.376 --> 02:03:52.657]  Alex Jones is in favor of homeschooling, preparedness, home gardening.
[02:03:52.657 --> 02:03:55.858]  All these issues that people on the left claim to care about
[02:03:56.518 --> 02:04:01.363]  And no one's ever heard that about you, so I'm just trying to remind people what you actually stand for.
[02:04:01.363 --> 02:04:07.529]  Well, I appreciate you defending me, but I mean, look, I've tried to defend other people that have been under attack, and there wasn't that much interest.
[02:04:07.529 --> 02:04:08.891]  I guess they were smaller.
[02:04:08.891 --> 02:04:10.152]  Now, this is really big.
[02:04:10.152 --> 02:04:15.798]  I mean, I think they have really gone too far here, but at the same time, I think they know they've gone too far.
[02:04:15.798 --> 02:04:20.022]  They're planning something really, really big, Mike, and I think it's about to happen.
[02:04:21.124 --> 02:04:23.366]  Yeah, clearly something very, very soon.
[02:04:23.366 --> 02:04:23.867]  I agree.
[02:04:23.867 --> 02:04:24.647]  I've warned about it.
[02:04:24.647 --> 02:04:25.308]  You've warned about it.
[02:04:25.308 --> 02:04:32.615]  And by the way, you and I both warned about this censorship coming, and that's why we built alternative platforms and took measures.
[02:04:32.615 --> 02:04:34.297]  We saw this.
[02:04:34.297 --> 02:04:35.018]  Absolutely.
[02:04:35.018 --> 02:04:37.180]  But who knew we'd be right in the middle of it?
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:40.643]  Do another segment with us on how we counter this and what President Trump needs to do.
[02:04:40.643 --> 02:04:42.385]  And listen, Trump's great, folks, but
[02:04:43.746 --> 02:04:45.891]  A lot of issues, but this is the big issue.
[02:04:45.891 --> 02:04:48.677]  As big as the border, this is absolutely paramount.
[02:04:48.677 --> 02:04:52.806]  This is how they plan to shut him up and stop this pro-America agenda.
[02:04:52.806 --> 02:04:53.507]  We've got to defeat it.
[02:04:56.428 --> 02:04:58.749]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:01.043 --> 02:06:07.288]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.896 --> 02:06:31.002]  I think they are watching me.
[02:06:31.002 --> 02:06:36.964]  Having a little bit of fun with it.
[02:06:36.964 --> 02:06:38.865]  Look at the New York Times.
[02:06:38.865 --> 02:06:42.006]  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of news articles an hour coming out.
[02:06:42.006 --> 02:06:43.047]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:06:44.062 --> 02:06:45.203]  It's unbelievable.
[02:06:45.203 --> 02:06:46.965]  And all the articles are written the same.
[02:06:46.965 --> 02:06:48.806]  They put the script out.
[02:06:48.806 --> 02:06:51.588]  They go, we're battling this evil, horrible person.
[02:06:51.588 --> 02:06:55.912]  No one buys white supremacy anymore, so they say, bully this and that.
[02:06:55.912 --> 02:07:07.061]  And then they go from there, and they say, but the problem is there's thousands of other sites and people we've got to ban, and Fox News is bad, and it's all bad, ban it, ban it, ban it.
[02:07:07.061 --> 02:07:08.502]  Who would put up with this?
[02:07:08.502 --> 02:07:09.043]  And then you've got
[02:07:10.285 --> 02:07:16.328]  The calls by Democrat senators and leaked memos where they want to ban even Fox News.
[02:07:16.328 --> 02:07:37.099]  And I'm telling you folks, the Democrats early on appointed a bunch of people, these special committees that Obama signed executive orders for, to federalize elections and say that everything was Russian fraud, and then overturn the 2016 election at some point, then have a new federalization of elections where you'll never have a real two-party system again.
[02:07:38.038 --> 02:07:46.123]  And we've got Andrew Torba of Gab.ai that Google and others have tried to shut down a truly open and free independent social media system.
[02:07:46.123 --> 02:07:47.044]  He's joining us.
[02:07:47.044 --> 02:07:48.345]  And Mike Adams is riding shotgun.
[02:07:48.345 --> 02:07:50.586]  I wanted to finish up with you, Mike.
[02:07:50.586 --> 02:07:52.508]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:07:52.508 --> 02:07:55.970]  They now admit they want to censor even Fox News.
[02:07:55.970 --> 02:08:01.394]  They want to take over because they know the planet's realigned against collectivism and globalism and leftist garbage.
[02:08:02.438 --> 02:08:06.042]  You've got Real.Video and yourself doing your own platform.
[02:08:06.042 --> 02:08:13.650]  But now they're saying, hey, we're going to go after the bandwidth, the servers, the hubs, the DNS, the credit cards, everything.
[02:08:13.650 --> 02:08:14.671]  I mean, it's here.
[02:08:14.671 --> 02:08:19.296]  This is the assault on free speech by the big tech firms in the deep state.
[02:08:19.296 --> 02:08:22.078]  Trump's only in control of a small percentage of the government now.
[02:08:22.759 --> 02:08:27.360]  And I just think he has to move against this organized rebellion, this mutiny that we see.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.762]  I think this is a desperation act by Big Tech and the Democrats.
[02:08:30.762 --> 02:08:33.442]  But if we don't rise to the occasion, they could win.
[02:08:33.442 --> 02:08:34.623]  Mike, what do you think?
[02:08:34.623 --> 02:08:35.423]  Right.
[02:08:35.423 --> 02:08:43.085]  Even this morning, my staff at Real.Video received an email that claimed to be from the police of the city of Berkeley.
[02:08:43.085 --> 02:08:48.927]  And this email said that we have to take down all Alex Jones videos because of violations of the DMCA.
[02:08:48.927 --> 02:08:50.148]  See, it's all out of Berkeley.
[02:08:50.148 --> 02:08:51.068]  That's their real capital.
[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:52.280]  That's right.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.062]  Now, they didn't cite any video.
[02:08:54.062 --> 02:08:54.462]  Nothing.
[02:08:54.462 --> 02:08:57.705]  So, of course, we had a good laugh about that email.
[02:08:57.705 --> 02:08:59.006]  And it could have been a hoax.
[02:08:59.006 --> 02:08:59.526]  I don't know.
[02:08:59.526 --> 02:09:01.408]  But that's just what they're doing to everybody.
[02:09:01.408 --> 02:09:03.590]  It's a big intimidation operation.
[02:09:03.590 --> 02:09:04.330]  Exactly.
[02:09:04.330 --> 02:09:12.037]  And, you know, look, Reel.Video now has a couple hundred InfoWars videos, and there are more uploaded every hour.
[02:09:12.037 --> 02:09:18.102]  They're not going to be able to voluntarily take those down, because... And by the way, just to interrupt, we've got a thousand.
[02:09:19.102 --> 02:09:24.464]  Of our highest viewed videos that we're now going to upload there, of the 35,000 they blew away.
[02:09:24.464 --> 02:09:40.269]  We're ready to handle it, but the thing is, as you mentioned, if our bandwidth provider bans us, if the components that we use, we use off the shelf different components, we rely on different components to do the server hosting and the video streaming, many other companies involved in those components
[02:09:40.909 --> 02:09:48.314]  If they, you know, choose to try to violate their terms of service and cut us off, you know, we'll have to seek alternatives.
[02:09:48.314 --> 02:09:49.695]  It's an all-out war.
[02:09:49.695 --> 02:09:51.297]  It's a financial war.
[02:09:51.297 --> 02:09:52.417]  It's an infrastructure war.
[02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:56.000]  It's a communications war to say you don't even have the right to speak.
[02:09:57.156 --> 02:10:07.563]  And we're supposed to have the same protections that YouTube has, but of course, it will be selectively, it will be targeted because we're hosting InfoWars videos now, you see.
[02:10:07.563 --> 02:10:25.775]  So, it's all, it's a double standard, you know, you don't have free speech, but the New York Times can hire a bigoted, racist, you know, anti-white person, and they say, well that's not racism, that's not hate, but somehow when you say that babies are born as either a boy or a girl,
[02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:31.516]  And not something in between, then, oh, all of a sudden you're attacking transgenders.
[02:10:31.516 --> 02:10:33.278]  You know, that's hate speech.
[02:10:33.278 --> 02:10:37.964]  But when a New York Times staffer says, kill white people, somehow that's not hate speech.
[02:10:37.964 --> 02:10:39.826]  So, it's gone off the rails, Alex.
[02:10:39.826 --> 02:10:40.948]  It's completely insane.
[02:10:41.855 --> 02:10:46.819]  And there are wars against you that I can't even mention.
[02:10:46.819 --> 02:10:48.941]  Crap behind the scenes stuff going on.
[02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:57.089]  I mean, I've had conversations with you off the air that I won't repeat here of stuff that they tried to get me to do, you know, against you years ago, and I refuse.
[02:10:57.089 --> 02:10:59.270]  And that's when Google banned my website.
[02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:00.872]  So there's stuff.
[02:11:00.872 --> 02:11:02.854]  The war against you is so coordinated.
[02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:03.774]  It is so criminal.
[02:11:03.774 --> 02:11:05.416]  It's so fraudulent.
[02:11:05.416 --> 02:11:08.739]  And that's why I'm here standing up for your right to speak as well as everybody else's.
[02:11:09.551 --> 02:11:11.112]  Look at the latest New York Times article.
[02:11:11.112 --> 02:11:12.914]  A better way to ban Alex Jones.
[02:11:12.914 --> 02:11:16.677]  Boy, they've gone right to it.
[02:11:16.677 --> 02:11:20.440]  And of course, out of the Deep South, try to shut down the New York Times.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:21.421]  They did it with lawsuits.
[02:11:21.421 --> 02:11:23.142]  We had New York Times versus Sullivan.
[02:11:23.142 --> 02:11:29.207]  The New York Times is now owned by a Mexican kingpin with Chinese connections is trying to overthrow the First Amendment.
[02:11:29.207 --> 02:11:33.130]  What a sickening situation for the great lady.
[02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:38.435]  And where this goes, by the way, I was watching a video of Stefan Molyneux just this morning.
[02:11:39.364 --> 02:11:45.530]  And where this goes, as he said, is you can't even have a conversation now with people on the left.
[02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:46.390]  There's no rationality.
[02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:47.451]  Oh yeah, that's the news.
[02:11:47.451 --> 02:11:50.514]  They're saying de-platform anyone interviewing me.
[02:11:50.514 --> 02:11:55.719]  Now Google's talking about, we just may not let Alex Jones on, period.
[02:11:55.719 --> 02:11:58.341]  Like this is true beyond even a science fiction book.
[02:11:59.178 --> 02:12:04.501]  Yeah, it's dystopian, but it's also going to lead to probably violence by the left.
[02:12:04.501 --> 02:12:12.927]  I mean, look at the violence that happened in the three cities over the weekend, and yet nobody in the mainstream media reported any of the left-wing Antifa violence.
[02:12:12.927 --> 02:12:14.368]  They pretended that it didn't happen.
[02:12:15.846 --> 02:12:16.586]  It's incredible.
[02:12:16.586 --> 02:12:19.989]  I mean, we're living in almost like an alternate reality.
[02:12:19.989 --> 02:12:20.249]  It is.
[02:12:20.249 --> 02:12:20.869]  Stay there.
[02:12:20.869 --> 02:12:21.870]  Stay there.
[02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:22.570]  Stay there, right there.
[02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:24.212]  We'll get a final cover from you in a moment.
[02:12:24.212 --> 02:12:25.713]  Mike out of centralnews.com.
[02:12:25.713 --> 02:12:28.235]  Andrew Torba joining us now and through the next segment.
[02:12:28.235 --> 02:12:30.156]  Andrew, heads up, gab.ai.
[02:12:30.156 --> 02:12:31.517]  He's had them trying to shut him down.
[02:12:31.517 --> 02:12:35.020]  You know, they're not just their own, quote, companies that operate as utilities.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:36.661]  They have double standards.
[02:12:36.661 --> 02:12:38.062]  They've been trying to shut you down.
[02:12:38.062 --> 02:12:40.704]  What would you call, Andrew, this point in time and history we've now reached?
[02:12:42.156 --> 02:12:49.958]  Alex, it's a really scary point in time history and I think Matt Drudge a few years ago with that classic interview with you nailed it.
[02:12:49.958 --> 02:12:54.960]  We need to stop playing on the left's playgrounds because this is what's going to happen.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:56.820]  They're going to un-person us.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:01.842]  We need to start building like myself and like Mike are doing and like you're doing with InfoWars and have been for years.
[02:13:02.322 --> 02:13:04.603]  We need to build our own platforms.
[02:13:04.603 --> 02:13:09.764]  The problem is that when we do that, as Mike mentioned, we rely on third-party payment processors.
[02:13:09.764 --> 02:13:11.925]  We rely on third-party hosts.
[02:13:11.925 --> 02:13:17.787]  And if any of those wheels in the machine decide to pull out the rug from under us, what are we going to do?
[02:13:17.787 --> 02:13:18.747]  We have to build our own.
[02:13:18.747 --> 02:13:23.168]  Are we going to have to rebuild the internet from the ground up here just to be able to speak our minds?
[02:13:23.168 --> 02:13:26.629]  It's insanity.
[02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:28.790]  One thing's for sure, they're making their move now, aren't they?
[02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:31.130]  Absolutely.
[02:13:31.130 --> 02:13:32.751]  They and you are just the start.
[02:13:32.751 --> 02:13:35.893]  You know, we've been talking about this for over two years now.
[02:13:35.893 --> 02:13:40.916]  We've been building Gab as a alternative for people to come and speak freely.
[02:13:40.916 --> 02:13:42.656]  We've said everybody's welcome.
[02:13:42.656 --> 02:13:46.659]  They tried to malign us and call us a Nazi social network.
[02:13:46.659 --> 02:13:49.200]  Both Apple and Google have not allowed us to part.
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:52.261]  Participate in their app stores, and they have a duopoly.
[02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:57.343]  There is no free market when it comes to mobile app hardware, mobile app distribution.
[02:13:57.343 --> 02:14:06.988]  Apple and Google are 98% of the market share, so that is not a free market when they can not only decide who wins and loses, but also who can play the game.
[02:14:06.988 --> 02:14:09.168]  It's really disgusting, and we need to keep building.
[02:14:09.168 --> 02:14:12.470]  We need to keep fighting back and stop playing on their playgrounds.
[02:14:13.885 --> 02:14:14.966]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:14.966 --> 02:14:19.011]  I've got a new sickening article by Elizabeth Williamson, uh, who's here.
[02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:26.441]  Says she's doing a profile of me working with this other Pulitzer Prize winner that's giving, uh, peace prizes to Barack Obama that launched all the wars.
[02:14:26.441 --> 02:14:28.904]  So, like, it'd be like giving, you know, it'd be like being proud of a
[02:14:29.464 --> 02:14:34.791]  Brought a iron cross Hitler gave you but then she goes into how I just want money.
[02:14:34.791 --> 02:14:37.234]  I'm telling listeners Oh by product support me.
[02:14:37.234 --> 02:14:44.883]  Well, you only had 20 suits against me that Soros is funding Oh, you're only trying to completely and absolutely shut me down and you know
[02:14:45.263 --> 02:14:47.745]  You've only got all this going on and we're trying to build our own infrastructure.
[02:14:47.745 --> 02:14:52.149]  So how dare us not be financed by Carlos Slim, the big kingpin.
[02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:55.192]  We're going to come back to you in just a moment, Andrew Torban, and get your take on this.
[02:14:55.192 --> 02:14:58.655]  But in closing, Mike Adams, it's just sick how these people operate.
[02:14:58.655 --> 02:15:08.504]  Sorry I'm not Carlos Slim that got $5 billion in Obama money to run the Obama phone program and rip off taxpayers and then launder the money back in the New York Times, a globalist intelligence op.
[02:15:08.504 --> 02:15:09.285]  Sorry, I'm not a criminal.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:13.341]  Well, again, look at what funds the left-wing media.
[02:15:13.341 --> 02:15:26.626]  For the most part, it's Big Pharma, which poisons our children with mind-altering, psychotropic drugs, for example, antidepressants that have been implicated in many mass shootings, mass drugging, statin drugs, all these drugs.
[02:15:27.126 --> 02:15:31.509]  That is part of what's destroying the sanity of our society, by the way.
[02:15:31.509 --> 02:15:32.610]  And what are you offering?
[02:15:32.610 --> 02:15:39.575]  Oh, health-enhancing products that have nutrition and prevention, that help people heal and live healthier, happier lives.
[02:15:39.575 --> 02:15:41.376]  Oh my God, how evil is that?
[02:15:41.376 --> 02:15:44.699]  Well, I'm betting on humanity, and I'm betting on free speech.
[02:15:44.699 --> 02:15:52.364]  And all the Chi-Coms, and all the globalists, and all the EUs, and all the Hollywoods, and all the New York Times can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:15:52.364 --> 02:15:52.885]  Stay with us.
[02:15:52.885 --> 02:15:53.945]  Andrew Torba straight ahead.
[02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:54.526]  Thanks, Mike Adams.
[02:15:55.137 --> 02:15:56.038]  It's a no-brainer.

[02:16:54.970 --> 02:16:58.575]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[02:17:24.688 --> 02:17:27.209]  Lincoln was elected to United Nation for the first time.
[02:17:27.329 --> 02:17:29.851]  The left tried to smear him and went to war with him.
[02:17:29.851 --> 02:17:33.634]  Can President Trump and we come together and save America a second time?
[02:17:33.634 --> 02:17:40.981]  Death of a Nation is the latest film from number one New York Times best-selling author Danish D'Souza and Academy Award-winning producer Gerald R. Mullen.

[02:18:03.776 --> 02:18:04.237]  It's you!

[02:18:07.844 --> 02:18:09.165]  You are the info war.
[02:18:09.165 --> 02:18:12.128]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:37.869]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:19:09.233 --> 02:19:24.785]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:19:25.925 --> 02:19:29.766]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[02:19:47.291 --> 02:19:51.413]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:19:51.413 --> 02:19:55.514]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:19:59.119 --> 02:20:10.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.364 --> 02:20:12.224]  We are on the march.
[02:20:12.224 --> 02:20:15.406]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:19.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:20:24.264 --> 02:20:26.466]  So they're not just censoring me off these big platforms.
[02:20:26.466 --> 02:20:33.811]  They're trying to go after every facet of what we do, from our email servers to programs we use for social networks.
[02:20:33.811 --> 02:20:38.454]  I mean, they're digging in to stuff that's not even public.
[02:20:38.454 --> 02:20:46.420]  Running intelligence ops, sending emails out to just every business there is, saying, we know you've got Jones, we're going to boycott you, and hoping some are actually doing business.
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:50.843]  So they go, look and go, the Nazis knocked on the door and said, we better not be helping the Jews next door.
[02:20:52.352 --> 02:21:09.160]  And you read this bizarre quote the New York Times is trumpeting in all these articles against me by this ridiculous senator, Chris anti-America Murphy, says InfoWars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies.
[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:13.963]  They use sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[02:21:13.963 --> 02:21:15.984]  That's all they do.
[02:21:15.984 --> 02:21:18.725]  These companies must do more than just take down one website.
[02:21:20.353 --> 02:21:27.081]  Their survival of our democracy depends on it, said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a strident critic of M4s.
[02:21:27.081 --> 02:21:29.844]  That idiot, as you know how the web works, calls it a website.
[02:21:29.844 --> 02:21:39.014]  So, it's a multimedia platform, just like CNN reaching people, and CNN's at the forefront, always tattling, going, Instagram's still got it, Twitter does, but don't worry!
[02:21:39.835 --> 02:21:43.301]  Pinterest and MailChimp, they took them down.
[02:21:43.301 --> 02:21:45.364]  I mean, it's so criminal.
[02:21:45.364 --> 02:21:46.726]  It's so anti-American.
[02:21:46.726 --> 02:21:52.536]  But the left, how did the left get turned into such a monolithic group of anti-free speech monsters?
[02:21:55.526 --> 02:22:07.576]  Well Alex, I don't know where the turning point came for the left, where they turned into monsters, but they used to be pro-free speech, and now all of a sudden we see these double standards and this hypocrisy.
[02:22:07.576 --> 02:22:21.548]  One of our users, Meme America, spent all weekend surfacing anti-white hate speech on Twitter by verified accounts, including journalists from BuzzFeed and CNN and all these other outlets that preach about hate speech.
[02:22:22.048 --> 02:22:23.172]  Oh yeah, that's the culture.
[02:22:23.172 --> 02:22:26.844]  It's not just that lady at the New York Times saying whites are subhuman.
[02:22:26.844 --> 02:22:27.746]  This is the culture.
[02:22:29.122 --> 02:22:29.743]  Exactly.
[02:22:29.743 --> 02:22:36.248]  It's, it's hundreds and hundreds of verified accounts that we surfaced over the weekend and took screenshots and archived all of them.
[02:22:36.248 --> 02:22:37.088]  And this is okay.
[02:22:37.088 --> 02:22:38.269]  No one is talking about this.
[02:22:38.269 --> 02:22:39.590]  This is totally allowed.
[02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:47.256]  As long as you're saying something about whites or about Christians or about Trump supporters or about conservatives or about Alex Jones, you're allowed to be hateful.
[02:22:47.256 --> 02:22:48.777]  You're allowed to call for death threats.
[02:22:48.777 --> 02:22:57.024]  You're allowed to say these things, but this is a culture that they've created and it's a double standard and it must be exposed and we must fight back.
[02:22:57.344 --> 02:23:04.409]  By the way, you're a pretty good tech guy, a mid-level out there, and knew some of the highest level folks in Silicon Valley when you got discussed.
[02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:07.030]  I've heard you tell your story.
[02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:12.994]  And WikiLeaks calls San Francisco and the whole area the imperial cultural elite, or the cultural imperial elite.
[02:23:12.994 --> 02:23:17.317]  And it really is their own weird psycho bubble, and they really think they're going to dominate all of us.
[02:23:17.317 --> 02:23:20.439]  I mean, these are like, these are like super villain characters.
[02:23:21.505 --> 02:23:21.946]  Absolutely.
[02:23:21.946 --> 02:23:23.127]  They're morally superior.
[02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:24.850]  They think they're intellectually superior.
[02:23:24.850 --> 02:23:29.316]  They think they know what is right for society and the direction that society should be in.
[02:23:29.316 --> 02:23:30.978]  They want to tell you how to think.
[02:23:30.978 --> 02:23:32.180]  They want to tell you how to vote.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:36.546]  They want to tell you what you can and cannot talk about, what is real news and what isn't.
[02:23:36.866 --> 02:23:40.168]  They want total control, and that's what we're seeing now with the Internet.
[02:23:40.168 --> 02:23:46.852]  As Matt Drudge said so articulately a couple of years ago, they are recreating the Internet in their image.
[02:23:46.852 --> 02:23:59.600]  The Internet, by design, routes around censorship, and that's why we're going to continue building, and hopefully others will rise up and continue to build alternatives so that we can escape the chains of Silicon Valley ideological echo chambers.
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:01.201]  You just said it.
[02:24:01.201 --> 02:24:02.422]  I remember that quote from Drudge.
[02:24:02.422 --> 02:24:03.183]  It's true.
[02:24:03.183 --> 02:24:08.567]  They're recreating the web in their own image, meaning us in their own image, and just the hate, the disdain.
[02:24:08.567 --> 02:24:26.822]  But what about, what about their scruffy, dumbed-down college professor or college student antifa type that looked like, you know, glow-in-the-dark meth heads, when they saw that we had, you know, a third or more of the people weren't white at the pro-liberty rallies in San Francisco and areas, they flipped out.
[02:24:26.822 --> 02:24:29.384]  It was like they were really having some problems.
[02:24:30.433 --> 02:24:31.694]  Yeah, it destroys their narrative.
[02:24:31.694 --> 02:24:37.901]  I mean, just like Gab this week alone had 10,000 Kenyans join the site because they were being censored.
[02:24:37.901 --> 02:24:41.504]  An influential blogger in Kenya got banned from Twitter.
[02:24:41.504 --> 02:24:47.010]  That completely destroys their narrative that Gab is this alt-right, white supremacist, Nazi website.
[02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:48.751]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:51.014]  White supremacists can buy an ad in the newspaper just because you let...
[02:24:52.235 --> 02:24:54.897]  New Black Panthers or White Supremacy on there.
[02:24:54.897 --> 02:24:56.358]  That's because it's free speech.
[02:24:56.358 --> 02:24:59.361]  Come in Kenyans, come in Muslims, come in Christians.
[02:24:59.361 --> 02:25:01.783]  Let's have a real debate here.
[02:25:01.783 --> 02:25:02.303]  Absolutely.
[02:25:02.303 --> 02:25:04.064]  We welcome everybody and we always have.
[02:25:04.064 --> 02:25:06.867]  We have 500,000 users from around the world.
[02:25:06.867 --> 02:25:10.390]  I can promise you that not all of them are white, not all of them are Christian.
[02:25:10.390 --> 02:25:10.990]  And that's fine.
[02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:11.691]  That's a good thing.
[02:25:11.691 --> 02:25:12.832]  We want healthy debate.
[02:25:12.832 --> 02:25:14.593]  We want healthy discourse.
[02:25:14.593 --> 02:25:20.178]  Because right now we're stuck in these ideological echo chambers where we have narratives forced down our throats with these algorithms.
[02:25:20.638 --> 02:25:24.460]  And you said it best, you know, it's psychological manipulation.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:35.026]  They are forming this false perception, this alternate reality of what news is and what important information is, and these algorithms have bias.
[02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:40.789]  They are designed and written by human beings in San Francisco who have far-left leanings.
[02:25:40.789 --> 02:25:41.690]  It's just, it's a fact.
[02:25:42.677 --> 02:25:44.759]  And you've been saying that a long time, but notice WikiLeaks said that.
[02:25:44.759 --> 02:25:49.782]  They said, this is San Francisco, a tiny clique, trying to rule all of our minds.
[02:25:49.782 --> 02:25:58.028]  And the fact that you can't even say, I think it's wrong that a drag queen is in videos doing striptease dances for three-year-olds.
[02:25:58.028 --> 02:26:00.210]  They call that bullying a drag queen, and I'm banned.
[02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:02.031]  I mean, you lived out there.
[02:26:02.031 --> 02:26:03.372]  What's up with the drag queen thing?
[02:26:03.372 --> 02:26:05.234]  Because I'm not even against any of these people.
[02:26:05.234 --> 02:26:07.816]  I don't care if it's a regular topless dancer or a drag queen.
[02:26:07.816 --> 02:26:10.398]  There shouldn't be three-year-olds putting money in their G-string.
[02:26:10.398 --> 02:26:11.739]  What the hell planet is this?
[02:26:13.123 --> 02:26:20.529]  Well, I mean, it's no surprise that they donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign 60 times more than the Trump campaign.
[02:26:20.529 --> 02:26:24.553]  I think 98% of campaign contributions went to Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:24.553 --> 02:26:31.118]  You know, you're even having prominent conservatives, prominent libertarians that are tech investors that are maybe even contrarians.
[02:26:31.118 --> 02:26:32.860]  They're not even necessarily right-wing.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:37.524]  Maybe they're libertarians and they're up and leaving because they cannot stand the ideological echo chamber.
[02:26:38.244 --> 02:26:46.791]  It's madness, but it's just how... So what are they going to do as the hashtag walkaway accelerates, as the numbers of minorities supporting Trump in major polls doubles, even in Cook polls?
[02:26:46.791 --> 02:26:51.535]  I guess they're going to try to clamp down and then sell the clamp down on a straw man of me they built.
[02:26:51.535 --> 02:26:52.496]  I don't think it's working.
[02:26:52.496 --> 02:26:53.857]  Be honest with me, Andrew Torba.
[02:26:53.857 --> 02:26:57.961]  You're a smart guy, an engineer, have, you know, your big social media site.
[02:26:57.961 --> 02:26:59.582]  Do you think they're winning right now?
[02:26:59.582 --> 02:27:01.404]  Because I don't want to be too positive, though.
[02:27:01.404 --> 02:27:04.046]  This is going to be rough for us, but I mean, I don't see this going well.
[02:27:05.473 --> 02:27:09.195]  If they were winning, they wouldn't have needed to unperson you from the internet.
[02:27:09.195 --> 02:27:12.356]  That shows just how powerful we the people are.
[02:27:12.356 --> 02:27:14.937]  And this movement is global.
[02:27:14.937 --> 02:27:19.439]  I think we forget it's not only happening in America, it's happening in the UK, it's happening across Europe.
[02:27:19.439 --> 02:27:23.841]  You know, there are people that are rising up and speaking truth to power.
[02:27:23.841 --> 02:27:25.262]  And they're going to continue to do so.
[02:27:25.262 --> 02:27:27.823]  And they're going to continue to take their country back, their culture back.
[02:27:28.343 --> 02:27:29.243]  We're good to go.
[02:27:44.232 --> 02:27:50.316]  Well, they admit it's panicum that minorities are joining the Liberty Movement and realizing they're lying.
[02:27:50.316 --> 02:27:56.401]  And all the minorities we talk to say they go check the lies, and the lies are so big they're like, well, I'm not going to be part of this group.
[02:27:56.401 --> 02:28:00.363]  They don't like constantly hearing about racism and being, you know, like Candace Owens.
[02:28:00.363 --> 02:28:07.288]  He had the liberals, like, doxing her and, like, pretending they were right-wingers after her to then scare her into their arms.
[02:28:07.288 --> 02:28:09.590]  I mean, they're literally psychologically hunting these people.
[02:28:10.899 --> 02:28:11.519]  Absolutely.
[02:28:11.519 --> 02:28:23.963]  And I think, you know, anytime any one of them steps out of their filter bubble and says, hey, yeah, I support Trump or, hey, I'm a conservative or steps out of line, that's when they get attacked and they get all these death threats.
[02:28:23.963 --> 02:28:28.084]  And the racism from the left is, it's really insanity.
[02:28:28.084 --> 02:28:29.945]  And hopefully a lot of people are waking up from it.
[02:28:30.512 --> 02:28:31.453]  Do a few more minutes with us.
[02:28:31.453 --> 02:28:33.435]  I want to talk about the Kenyans joining you.
[02:28:33.435 --> 02:28:39.181]  Globally, censorship increases in Africa, in Brazil, in France.
[02:28:39.181 --> 02:28:45.568]  I mean, everywhere this is happening, we're the political parties and the politicians are losing, so they crack down on speech.
[02:28:45.568 --> 02:28:50.413]  And that's how something like Gab can go from being big to ginormous overnight, which is what we need.
[02:28:50.413 --> 02:28:51.834]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.

[02:32:28.999 --> 02:32:37.542]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[02:32:39.162 --> 02:32:40.763]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:10.174 --> 02:33:18.165]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:33:18.165 --> 02:33:27.678]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems.
[02:33:28.118 --> 02:33:32.102]  ...and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:33:32.102 --> 02:33:36.527]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[02:33:36.527 --> 02:33:40.871]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:33:40.871 --> 02:33:42.994]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[02:33:45.646 --> 02:33:52.428]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[02:33:52.428 --> 02:33:58.949]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[02:33:58.949 --> 02:34:00.970]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[02:34:00.970 --> 02:34:01.950]  It's fulfilling.
[02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:03.050]  InfoWars.
[02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:04.250]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:05.411]  Today.
[02:34:05.411 --> 02:34:07.411]  You are the one they call President?
[02:34:07.411 --> 02:34:07.611]  I am.
[02:34:07.611 --> 02:34:09.132]  Kneel before the sun.
[02:34:09.132 --> 02:34:09.272]  Kneel!
[02:34:25.922 --> 02:34:27.763]  You are not the President.
[02:34:27.763 --> 02:34:32.446]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[02:34:32.446 --> 02:34:34.147]  I'm the man they're protecting.
[02:34:34.147 --> 02:34:36.748]  I'm the President.
[02:34:57.165 --> 02:34:59.666]  Roger Stone is joining us with the big exclusives here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:59.666 --> 02:35:06.188]  We're finishing up with Andrew Torba, the computer programmer and engineer that founded Gab.ai after he saw all the incredible censorship going on.
[02:35:06.188 --> 02:35:09.450]  And that's why I always have all these other great people on.
[02:35:09.450 --> 02:35:11.690]  I feel good having DrudgeReport.com out there.
[02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:13.691]  I feel good having Gab.ai.
[02:35:13.691 --> 02:35:20.154]  I feel good having The Daily Caller and Tucker Carlson is on vacation this week, or you know he'd be commenting on all this.
[02:35:20.154 --> 02:35:21.674]  I feel good having Mike Savage out there.
[02:35:21.674 --> 02:35:23.535]  I'm going to be on his show today.
[02:35:23.535 --> 02:35:25.956]  They have lied and twisted what I've said.
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:35.806]  Never let me clarified, then called for me to be censored, and now they're accelerating it to going after our infrastructure.
[02:35:35.806 --> 02:35:40.148]  And here is the New York Times, they have a neocon, David French, writing this for the National Review.
[02:35:40.148 --> 02:35:44.271]  For the New York Times, a better way to ban Alex Jones, sue him!
[02:35:44.271 --> 02:35:51.376]  And then have an objective term saying he's a slanderer, and then ban all his speech previous, I mean, after that.
[02:35:53.038 --> 02:35:55.259]  And that's their whole track with all of this.
[02:35:55.259 --> 02:35:56.240]  And then here's the next one.
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:58.601]  Oh, New York Times' Elizabeth Williamson.
[02:35:58.601 --> 02:36:05.164]  Alex Jones demands, I demand his InfoWars followers rise up and buy more merchandise.
[02:36:05.164 --> 02:36:10.967]  Yeah, I'd probably plug a minute and a half, an hour, The Average Talk Show, every 10 minutes.
[02:36:10.967 --> 02:36:14.668]  And the fact that I'm saying, hey, support us, buy products, help us stand against these people.
[02:36:14.668 --> 02:36:15.589]  That's what they don't want.
[02:36:15.589 --> 02:36:16.469]  They want me out of business.
[02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:19.791]  They're everywhere saying, ban me, ban me, ban me, shut me down.
[02:36:21.587 --> 02:36:27.129]  And I'm just like, hey, we got t-shirts, we got water filtration, we got non-GMO seeds, we got great supplements.
[02:36:27.129 --> 02:36:28.550]  We're supporting freedom.
[02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:29.610]  We're promoting free market.
[02:36:29.610 --> 02:36:31.031]  We're defending your Second Amendment.
[02:36:31.031 --> 02:36:35.713]  And they know our talking points get out there.
[02:36:35.713 --> 02:36:37.033]  And we're not dumb like Congress.
[02:36:37.033 --> 02:36:38.514]  We know they're shadowbanning all these people.
[02:36:38.514 --> 02:36:39.794]  We're trying to rally folks to wake up.
[02:36:39.794 --> 02:36:42.095]  And they're like, he knows China's funding this.
[02:36:42.095 --> 02:36:43.036]  He knows we're censoring.
[02:36:43.036 --> 02:36:45.356]  If this keeps happening, we're not going to be here anymore.
[02:36:45.356 --> 02:36:46.197]  Shut him up!
[02:36:47.025 --> 02:36:53.430]  Thinking you're so stupid they can go, well, I don't like Alex Jones, again, because of the straw man.
[02:36:53.430 --> 02:37:00.636]  I've had a bunch of liberal law firms go over everything we said, and they said, wow, we apologize, you really didn't say all the stuff you said.
[02:37:00.636 --> 02:37:03.198]  In fact, we think we have cases against them, and we do.
[02:37:03.198 --> 02:37:06.721]  I'm talking about Megyn Kelly and others.
[02:37:06.721 --> 02:37:14.307]  I mean, media, you know, what happened, Andrew, I don't want to ask you a question about what Trump should do, and we'll let you go and I'll get stoned on here.
[02:37:14.307 --> 02:37:15.208]  What happened where
[02:37:16.328 --> 02:37:26.393]  I asked this earlier, but they've just gone from lying to being like terrorist disrupter intelligence operations for the big banks in Soros.
[02:37:26.393 --> 02:37:31.115]  And then the average conservative is like, all the liberals always censors that are mean to us.
[02:37:31.115 --> 02:37:32.915]  No, this is next level.
[02:37:32.915 --> 02:37:33.636]  This is illegal.
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:40.982]  And finally, Matt Gaetz, after being a buffoon in the hearing, goes, oh my God, this is donations in kind.
[02:37:40.982 --> 02:37:43.503]  I filed with the Federal Election Commission.
[02:37:43.503 --> 02:37:46.244]  They're blocking me and letting everybody else post.
[02:37:46.244 --> 02:37:47.685]  Yeah!
[02:37:47.685 --> 02:37:48.765]  Yeah!
[02:37:48.765 --> 02:37:50.466]  It isn't a private company argument.
[02:37:50.466 --> 02:37:51.646]  They say it's open.
[02:37:51.646 --> 02:37:52.666]  You don't violate the rules.
[02:37:52.666 --> 02:37:56.388]  I have the screenshots of YouTube where it says we were all in good standing when they banned us.
[02:37:57.068 --> 02:37:59.470]  That's what they can't stand, so they just say nebulous stuff.
[02:37:59.470 --> 02:38:03.232]  Islamophobia, transphobia, and bullying children.
[02:38:03.232 --> 02:38:07.235]  Because I said, look at these drag queens shaking their butts in little kids' faces.
[02:38:07.235 --> 02:38:08.516]  What freaking planet is this?
[02:38:08.516 --> 02:38:10.017]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:38:10.017 --> 02:38:12.419]  So what should we do about Trump and where does this end?
[02:38:13.846 --> 02:38:19.293]  Well, Alex, I think we had a good start with Trump when he addressed the shadow banning issue on Twitter.
[02:38:19.293 --> 02:38:22.097]  I believe it was a week and a half ago or so.
[02:38:22.097 --> 02:38:23.939]  But the FEC needs to act.
[02:38:23.939 --> 02:38:27.864]  This is direct election interference.
[02:38:27.864 --> 02:38:31.669]  You know, at first, Big Tech tried to lie about it and tried to cover this stuff up.
[02:38:32.029 --> 02:38:32.529]  We're good to go.
[02:38:48.594 --> 02:39:07.101]  Well, there's also lower forms of that, like the quality filter shadow ban, where if it's applied to your account, and of course it's applied to only conservatives, only Trump supporters, only influencers in those networks on the right, well basically you're not showing up in search results, you're not showing up in other feeds, in different hashtags.
[02:39:07.861 --> 02:39:09.802]  This is direct election interference.
[02:39:09.802 --> 02:39:18.904]  When you have Republican candidates that are being shadow banned and their Democratic opponents have free reign to get their message out on the site, that's a problem.
[02:39:18.904 --> 02:39:20.865]  So Congress needs to act.
[02:39:20.865 --> 02:39:22.105]  President Trump needs to act.
[02:39:22.105 --> 02:39:23.666]  The FEC needs to act.
[02:39:23.666 --> 02:39:31.708]  And we simultaneously also need to be building alternatives like GAB and like others so that we don't play on their playgrounds anymore.
[02:39:32.819 --> 02:39:33.619]  Alright, brother.
[02:39:33.619 --> 02:39:34.519]  I totally agree.
[02:39:34.519 --> 02:39:35.760]  And I love Trump.
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:37.620]  He's right saying mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:38.300]  They admit they are.
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:39.341]  They want to get rid of free speech.
[02:39:39.341 --> 02:39:41.241]  They want to bankrupt the economy for control.
[02:39:41.241 --> 02:39:43.922]  But Trump needs to move.
[02:39:43.922 --> 02:39:45.182]  We need real hearings right now.
[02:39:45.182 --> 02:39:47.502]  We need emergency hearings.
[02:39:47.502 --> 02:39:48.823]  This needs to happen right now.
[02:39:48.823 --> 02:39:50.043]  This is incredible.
[02:39:50.043 --> 02:39:53.124]  This is absolute economic sabotage, economic warfare.
[02:39:53.124 --> 02:39:53.964]  It's siege.
[02:39:53.964 --> 02:39:54.784]  God bless you.
[02:39:54.784 --> 02:39:55.684]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:55.684 --> 02:39:58.585]  Gab.ai and at Gab on Twitter for now.
[02:40:00.342 --> 02:40:01.183]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:40:01.183 --> 02:40:01.603]  You bet.
[02:40:01.603 --> 02:40:01.943]  Thank you.
[02:40:01.943 --> 02:40:03.445]  We're going to go to break and come back with Roger Stone.
[02:40:03.445 --> 02:40:09.209]  Let me just throw this out here again because the New York Times says do not buy his products.
[02:40:09.209 --> 02:40:18.877]  I mean, it's just, you know, he's this terrible person and, you know, he says he's this gladiator and he needs to be fed if he can fight.
[02:40:18.877 --> 02:40:22.260]  They cannot stand it.
[02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:26.023]  They do not know what to do.
[02:40:27.298 --> 02:40:32.822]  They're all owned by horrid, corrupt kingpins, like Carlos Slim.
[02:40:32.822 --> 02:40:45.311]  And their religion, like baby birds born and trained to imprint on hate of America, is to destroy America, destroy Christians, and lead by weirdo white racists.
[02:40:45.311 --> 02:40:53.556]  The New York Times, and Asian racists, you name it, they are taught that whites are inherently evil, the most bizarre, whacked-out, Hitlerian crap.
[02:40:53.556 --> 02:40:55.498]  It's the same as Hitler, it's not just saying whites.
[02:40:56.502 --> 02:40:59.224]  I guess he was saying Jews were white or were the bad guys.
[02:40:59.224 --> 02:41:00.465]  It's just crazy town.
[02:41:00.465 --> 02:41:01.486]  They're authoritarians.
[02:41:01.486 --> 02:41:02.306]  It's easy.
[02:41:02.306 --> 02:41:03.928]  They're betting on you being dumb.
[02:41:03.928 --> 02:41:04.828]  They think they're going to win.
[02:41:04.828 --> 02:41:12.014]  So the number one thing is spread the articles, spread the videos, spread the links at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:41:12.014 --> 02:41:16.037]  Sign up for the free newsletter, which we can't send out today because MailChimp banned us.
[02:41:16.037 --> 02:41:17.038]  It's all economic warfare.
[02:41:18.883 --> 02:41:25.885]  Let them know, you're going to send a signal and send us a signal that we should continue on expanding, because if they start contracting us, they're going to really pound us.
[02:41:25.885 --> 02:41:26.746]  That's their plan.
[02:41:26.746 --> 02:41:29.947]  That's a beta test, that they can take us down, they can take anybody down.
[02:41:29.947 --> 02:41:35.249]  This is real racketeering, real organized crime, real bullying.
[02:41:35.249 --> 02:41:39.910]  Because we're an open society, so foreign money can come in, Chinese money can come in, globalist money.
[02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:43.391]  They got away with a lot of stuff, and now they're like, whoa, Americans are getting away from us.
[02:41:43.391 --> 02:41:45.132]  They're like, well, break their arms!
[02:41:47.066 --> 02:41:49.968]  And make an example of Alex Jones so other media backs off.
[02:41:49.968 --> 02:41:58.332]  Well, The Daily Caller and Breitbart and Drudge and WorldNetDaily and Everybody Just Unified and all these other talk show hosts behind us, including a lot of liberals that are real liberals.
[02:41:58.332 --> 02:42:03.295]  So I don't think your intimidation of Matt Drudge and Michael Savage worked too well, dirtbags.
[02:42:03.295 --> 02:42:05.796]  I had Michael Savage on three years ago when he had a book coming out.
[02:42:05.796 --> 02:42:08.638]  He's been a number one New York Times bestseller.
[02:42:08.638 --> 02:42:10.499]  It was about Chinese infiltration of the U.S.
[02:42:12.213 --> 02:42:17.656]  The book would not be put on shelves by publishers, by the companies, by Barnes & Noble.
[02:42:17.656 --> 02:42:21.198]  It was a failure.
[02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:23.539]  They mean business.
[02:42:23.539 --> 02:42:25.280]  Business.
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:26.701]  And me, I'm not rolling over this crap.
[02:42:26.701 --> 02:42:28.582]  That's not who I am.
[02:42:28.582 --> 02:42:30.103]  Most other men are like, let's just sell out.
[02:42:30.103 --> 02:42:30.783]  It'll be better for us.
[02:42:30.783 --> 02:42:31.664]  We'll have a bigger car.
[02:42:31.664 --> 02:42:34.365]  You'll have nothing, idiot!
[02:42:34.365 --> 02:42:38.327]  You got all this liberty because we had some people before us that would fight to be free.
[02:42:38.327 --> 02:42:38.948]  Or at least try.
[02:42:40.465 --> 02:42:41.026]  Take action.
[02:42:41.026 --> 02:42:42.008]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:42:42.008 --> 02:42:42.909]  A lot of big specials.
[02:42:42.909 --> 02:42:44.893]  10% off if you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:42:44.893 --> 02:42:46.315]  And that way you can support us each month.
[02:42:46.315 --> 02:42:47.176]  Cancel any time.
[02:42:47.176 --> 02:42:47.958]  Just do it.
[02:42:47.958 --> 02:42:48.859]  Just get in there.
[02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:49.841]  They hate it.
[02:42:49.841 --> 02:42:50.983]  Double down on us.
[02:42:50.983 --> 02:42:52.445]  You fund our war bonds.
[02:42:52.445 --> 02:42:53.246]  You got a commitment.
[02:42:53.246 --> 02:42:54.669]  We'll turbocharge even harder.
[02:42:55.464 --> 02:43:01.968]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:43:01.968 --> 02:43:08.793]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:43:08.793 --> 02:43:24.344]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:43:25.481 --> 02:43:29.324]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:43:29.324 --> 02:43:34.547]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:43:34.547 --> 02:43:35.848]  And here's the best part.
[02:43:35.848 --> 02:43:37.689]  It is absolutely free.
[02:43:37.689 --> 02:43:42.913]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.

[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:16.467]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:45:16.547 --> 02:45:32.778]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:45:33.278 --> 02:45:41.882]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:45:41.882 --> 02:45:46.785]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.

[02:46:58.724 --> 02:47:01.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.751 --> 02:47:14.226]  Well, quarterbacked by CNN and Media Matters, George Soros.
[02:47:15.276 --> 02:47:22.082]  The massive purge, not just off of these big social networks, but off of every form of business site you can imagine has begun.
[02:47:22.082 --> 02:47:29.788]  The Chinese social score, as they call it, or the mark of the beast, is being implemented on Alex Jones first in America.
[02:47:29.788 --> 02:47:31.990]  I'm not happy it's happening, but I'm honored.
[02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:43.940]  They're attempting to send me into the phantom zone by depersoning me, while humanity is awakening and rallying against the corrupt establishment that now, two minutes to midnight, realizes, bayo off.
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:57.552]  A new challenger faces Grendel, and will not be so easy as others.
[02:47:57.552 --> 02:47:59.534]  They see us as villains to be stripped of our stamina.
[02:47:59.534 --> 02:48:04.418]  You three criminals have been caught in a further act of seditious treason.
[02:48:04.418 --> 02:48:08.982]  General Zod, your only feeling was contempt for our society.
[02:48:08.982 --> 02:48:10.884]  Your only desire was to command.
[02:48:12.763 --> 02:48:20.488]  Ursa, the only feeling you showed was for your vicious general, your only wish to rule at his side.
[02:48:20.488 --> 02:48:27.012]  Don, you are as without thought as you are without voice.
[02:48:27.012 --> 02:48:33.316]  This council has no hesitation in proclaiming you all guilty.
[02:48:33.316 --> 02:48:33.696]  Guilty.
[02:48:36.414 --> 02:48:37.915]  Guilty.
[02:48:37.915 --> 02:48:38.816]  Guilty.
[02:48:38.816 --> 02:48:42.679]  You spoke out against hijabs and sexual mutilation.
[02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:45.382]  You spoke out for America and freedom.
[02:48:45.382 --> 02:48:47.484]  Now you pay.
[02:48:47.484 --> 02:48:49.866]  The New York Times says so.
[02:48:49.866 --> 02:48:51.707]  Even as it prepares to implode.
[02:48:51.707 --> 02:48:55.851]  Because once their job is finished, there'll be no need for them anymore.
[02:48:55.851 --> 02:49:00.015]  Prepare yourself for the phantoms of enslave.
[02:49:00.015 --> 02:49:02.337]  How dare you try to make America great again.
[02:49:10.529 --> 02:49:12.496]  Anyways, Roger Stone joins us.
[02:49:12.496 --> 02:49:13.078]  You know, Roger...
[02:49:14.033 --> 02:49:21.477]  I can make jokes about it, but if the Republicans don't get fully behind going after these people, not just standing up for me, they're screwed.
[02:49:21.477 --> 02:49:23.418]  This was the test cases I told you three weeks ago.
[02:49:23.418 --> 02:49:24.919]  I said, you watch.
[02:49:24.919 --> 02:49:34.745]  Those Republicans not knowing how to find their ass with both hands in that Judiciary Committee, with those lying tech heads in front of them, just green-lighted gang raping.
[02:49:34.745 --> 02:49:37.706]  And they shadow-ban them all the next day, members of Congress.
[02:49:37.706 --> 02:49:39.207]  These people think we're idiots.
[02:49:39.207 --> 02:49:41.869]  They're on the CHICOM payroll, but Matt Drudge gets it.
[02:49:42.529 --> 02:49:49.596]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'm kind of reminded of what was once G. Gordon Liddy's favorite saying from the German philosopher Nietzsche, who said, What's amazing to me
[02:50:06.957 --> 02:50:14.482]  Is the surge in the number of people going to the Infowars.com site to watch us live streaming.
[02:50:14.482 --> 02:50:22.128]  The number of people now signing up for your podcast, the War Room podcast, the Real News podcast.
[02:50:22.128 --> 02:50:29.233]  The number of people now, the bump in the ratings, like Cloud TV, more people watching us.
[02:50:29.813 --> 02:50:41.709]  Listen, listen, I forgot to tell you, we were number four, we're number three now on iTunes Store, ahead of CNN, about to beat Reddit.
[02:50:41.709 --> 02:50:45.094]  But here's the problem, they'll just ban us there.
[02:50:45.094 --> 02:50:47.217]  We're being banned because we're number one, Roger.
[02:50:47.817 --> 02:50:48.638]  There's no question.
[02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:51.480]  I think people need to understand how sweeping this is.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:52.942]  This is YouTube.
[02:50:52.942 --> 02:50:54.283]  This is Periscope.
[02:50:54.283 --> 02:50:56.284]  This is Apple.
[02:50:56.284 --> 02:50:59.127]  This is iTunes.
[02:50:59.127 --> 02:51:01.249]  This is Facebook.
[02:51:01.249 --> 02:51:02.850]  This is Spotify.
[02:51:02.850 --> 02:51:04.691]  I mean, it's a purge.
[02:51:04.691 --> 02:51:06.433]  It's a mugging.
[02:51:06.433 --> 02:51:15.661]  It's the test case, because there's no doubt in my mind that if they succeed in shutting InfoWars down, in strangling your First Amendment rights,
[02:51:16.281 --> 02:51:26.649]  My First Amendment rights at the War Room, which has suffered very badly from this because many of our viewers enjoy us on YouTube, where we are now banned.
[02:51:26.649 --> 02:51:29.692]  That's a good point, by the way.
[02:51:29.692 --> 02:51:34.996]  They've banned other talk show hosts and other podcasts on our platform that have their own websites.
[02:51:34.996 --> 02:51:36.517]  They've even banned site... Go ahead.
[02:51:37.617 --> 02:51:45.524]  So the point here is that Tucker Carlson and Matt Grudge have been among those who have stood tall, but they will be next.
[02:51:45.524 --> 02:51:56.674]  So will Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Mike Savage, Rush Limbaugh, all these patriots, all of these supporters of freedom are next on the hit list.
[02:51:56.674 --> 02:52:01.779]  And they need to get wise to it, because the attack on you is only a beachhead.
[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:16.776]  And we know that the government censorship board that was passed at the last minute by Obama as a part of the defense appropriations got their 43 million dollars in their first chunk of change and I suspect they're the ones driving this.
[02:52:17.456 --> 02:52:21.158]  Which, oddly enough, Obama gave them the authority to do.
[02:52:21.158 --> 02:52:24.659]  Well, funny, and Trump needs to revoke that, but they think he's ignorant to it.
[02:52:24.659 --> 02:52:31.701]  You have Dem Senator, who reportedly is on this secret board, demands more censorship of conservative sites, says Fox News, everyone, ban them.
[02:52:31.701 --> 02:52:32.822]  Chris Murphy.
[02:52:32.822 --> 02:52:39.604]  So, and then you've got the reason Democrats circulating plan for government takeover of the internet.
[02:52:39.604 --> 02:52:40.365]  I mean, it's here!
[02:52:40.365 --> 02:52:42.626]  This is outrageous authoritarianism!
[02:52:42.626 --> 02:52:43.126]  Good Lord!
[02:52:43.846 --> 02:52:49.309]  Well, it's the only way they can try to level the playing field to beat us in 2018 or 2020.
[02:52:49.309 --> 02:52:53.151]  There's a surge of freedomism.
[02:52:53.151 --> 02:52:54.452]  What does Trump need to do right now?
[02:52:54.452 --> 02:52:57.293]  Because the New York Times is salivating.
[02:52:57.293 --> 02:52:59.915]  The Washington Post is salivating.
[02:52:59.915 --> 02:53:03.476]  The BuzzFeed is like a cartoon character of the Nazis.
[02:53:03.476 --> 02:53:07.018]  I've read Nazi writings where they would talk about shutting down the press.
[02:53:07.018 --> 02:53:07.919]  This is like more
[02:53:09.153 --> 02:53:11.015]  Creamy-eyed than the Nazis.
[02:53:11.015 --> 02:53:21.705]  These people have shown themselves to be just lawless, frothing mercenaries, desperate little cretins, almost paid nothing, just servile lapdogs of evil.
[02:53:22.887 --> 02:53:29.708]  Well, first of all, the President, I think, needs to understand the issue fully and all the implications thereof.
[02:53:29.708 --> 02:53:43.211]  That means he needs to get a briefing from the House Republicans, who, although there may have been some flaws in their early arguments, are the only ones out there talking about this who seem to understand it.
[02:53:43.211 --> 02:53:48.491]  Perhaps they learned a lesson in the mass shadow ban of over 100 members of Congress.
[02:53:48.491 --> 02:53:51.372]  It shows that it can be done to everybody and anybody.
[02:53:52.212 --> 02:53:56.135]  This is a selective internet kill switch, a literal mark of the beast.
[02:53:56.135 --> 02:53:59.237]  This is the Chinese social score with the Chai-coms involved.
[02:53:59.237 --> 02:54:03.059]  Google announcing they're moving to China, helping censor here, Apple officially.
[02:54:03.059 --> 02:54:09.363]  What do you make of the Chai-coms threatening to take over Apple because it's now state-run and sabotaging it if Trump doesn't submit?
[02:54:09.363 --> 02:54:14.367]  I mean, we're already at war and the damn tech companies have decided against us!
[02:54:14.947 --> 02:54:19.273]  Well, they've sold their passcodes, in essence, to the Chinese for huge dollars.
[02:54:19.273 --> 02:54:29.645]  They've sold out their country, where they live, and where they've been able to prosper, to a Chinese Communist government who will now use our own data against us or withhold it from us.
[02:54:29.645 --> 02:54:30.627]  It's outrageous.
[02:54:32.605 --> 02:54:36.567]  Well, we need the listeners to go completely ape, and we need to call for antitrust now.
[02:54:36.567 --> 02:54:39.368]  We need to call for emergency hearings, for election meddling.
[02:54:39.368 --> 02:54:41.349]  This is the real election meddling.
[02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:48.452]  Red-handed the tech companies, censoring en masse, saying they will deliver the election, you know, to the Democrats.
[02:54:48.452 --> 02:54:49.953]  This is unbelievable.
[02:54:49.953 --> 02:54:53.855]  They are attacking our elections using the whole Russia thing as a smoke screen, Roger.
[02:54:54.295 --> 02:55:09.642]  Well, and this is the Deep State's effort to silence him, silence you, silence me, for the takedown of Trump and all of his associates, presumably his son, who is innocent of any crime, maybe even his son-in-law, yours truly.
[02:55:09.642 --> 02:55:15.585]  Alex, there's talk about them indicting you, which I find ridiculous, since you have committed no crimes.
[02:55:16.185 --> 02:55:16.825]  I forgot that.
[02:55:16.825 --> 02:55:18.426]  Only Mueller asking that.
[02:55:18.426 --> 02:55:22.386]  The New York Times asked me, how much do the Russians pay you?
[02:55:22.386 --> 02:55:24.227]  You know, how long have you worked for RT?
[02:55:24.227 --> 02:55:25.087]  And I said, I've never worked for RT.
[02:55:25.087 --> 02:55:26.367]  I haven't been on in years.
[02:55:26.367 --> 02:55:27.407]  And she was like, oh really?
[02:55:27.407 --> 02:55:28.428]  Well, we've got witnesses.
[02:55:28.428 --> 02:55:30.408]  It was like, oh, we've got you.
[02:55:30.408 --> 02:55:33.569]  Oh, really?
[02:55:33.569 --> 02:55:35.649]  You got some meth head or something?
[02:55:35.649 --> 02:55:36.589]  Or some heroin head?
[02:55:36.589 --> 02:55:40.390]  To say you saw me, you know, in bed with Putin getting peed on or something?
[02:55:40.390 --> 02:55:45.331]  I mean, that is, I'm telling you, these people, do you think the New York Times really believed that when they said that to me?
[02:55:46.152 --> 02:55:48.741]  I have no idea, but I will say this.
[02:55:48.741 --> 02:55:50.748]  You have to take what you actually said.
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:56:01.967]  And either bastardize it, or edit it, or truncate it, or twist it, to put the words in your mouth that the mainstream media has attributed to you.
[02:56:01.967 --> 02:56:07.932]  It's an intellectual mugging, the way they have to do this.
[02:56:07.932 --> 02:56:18.339]  So they distort what you say, then they use that distortion as the basis for blocking you on social media, which you and I have both been predicting now for months.
[02:56:18.339 --> 02:56:19.860]  It is the night of the long knives.
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.322]  And if we are first, who's next?
[02:56:25.322 --> 02:56:26.242]  And that's what I'm saying though.
[02:56:26.242 --> 02:56:29.003]  The Democrats didn't even wait a few days on me.
[02:56:29.003 --> 02:56:31.364]  They're now announcing they want everyone deplatformed.
[02:56:31.364 --> 02:56:32.645]  This is insane.
[02:56:32.645 --> 02:56:38.287]  Why would Warner and Murphy and all of them declare they want everybody shut down now?
[02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:40.388]  He says, I want hundreds of sites.
[02:56:40.388 --> 02:56:41.888]  I want Fox News.
[02:56:41.888 --> 02:56:42.649]  I want it all.
[02:56:42.649 --> 02:56:45.550]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:48.671]  They're overplaying their hand badly, in my opinion.
[02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:53.722]  The president needs to understand all of the implications.
[02:56:53.722 --> 02:56:57.944]  While they may not be shadowbanning him, although I wouldn't bet on that.
[02:56:57.944 --> 02:57:01.625]  They've got him dialed back on Twitter 90%.
[02:57:01.625 --> 02:57:07.688]  They can certainly manipulate the algorithms and they use a hundred computer tricks.
[02:57:07.688 --> 02:57:09.309]  We shouldn't just say it's that.
[02:57:09.309 --> 02:57:12.971]  Shadowbanning and there are many other techniques.
[02:57:12.971 --> 02:57:15.652]  They are strangling him.
[02:57:15.652 --> 02:57:18.193]  They don't want those things exposed in a courtroom.
[02:57:19.329 --> 02:57:23.511]  They are vulnerable on monopolistic antitrust practices.
[02:57:23.511 --> 02:57:36.256]  They're vulnerable on contract law issues, because when we went online and signed up, and particularly when we paid them for promoted advertisements, they entered into a contract with us.
[02:57:36.256 --> 02:57:40.598]  And they endorsed what we were saying, and even gave recommendations of what to do.
[02:57:40.598 --> 02:57:42.599]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone, then Paul Watson.
[02:57:42.599 --> 02:57:42.999]  Stay with us.
[02:57:46.317 --> 02:57:54.860]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the Infowar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:58.361]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[02:57:58.361 --> 02:58:07.884]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[02:58:07.884 --> 02:58:15.067]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one
[02:58:15.307 --> 02:58:18.910]  Best selling product at InfoWarsLife.com because it works so well.
[02:58:18.910 --> 02:58:27.136]  This is a gift you want to give yourself and then rest assured you're fighting the Info War so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.

[02:58:34.702 --> 02:58:35.462]  It's for sports.
[02:58:35.462 --> 02:58:37.644]  It's for activities and it's made in the USA.
[02:58:37.644 --> 02:58:40.926]  Get your Alpha Power today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:40.926 --> 02:58:43.969]  Everybody needs to try Alpha Power today.
[02:58:46.354 --> 02:58:51.195]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:51.195 --> 02:59:00.657]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:00.657 --> 02:59:05.438]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:59:05.438 --> 02:59:13.720]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[02:59:13.840 --> 02:59:14.160]  I think so.
[02:59:43.462 --> 02:59:57.788]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil.
[03:00:07.998 --> 03:00:16.481]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:16.481 --> 03:00:20.823]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:20.823 --> 03:00:25.004]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:25.004 --> 03:00:26.625]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.306 --> 03:00:31.987]  Paul Watson is going to be hosting the next segment.
[03:00:31.987 --> 03:00:34.508]  I'm going to host one segment with him and then get out of here for a little while.
[03:00:34.508 --> 03:00:38.670]  I'm going to be on with Mike Savage in about 30 minutes and a bunch of other interviews today.
[03:00:38.670 --> 03:00:42.031]  I got a whole bunch of them.
[03:00:42.031 --> 03:00:43.192]  I'm just sitting over the floodgates.
[03:00:43.192 --> 03:00:47.234]  Is anybody real?
[03:00:47.234 --> 03:00:52.776]  Some of these national TV shows want me on but they want me to go do live satellite feeds so I'll do it tomorrow.
[03:00:52.776 --> 03:00:53.517]  Problem is they lie.
[03:00:53.517 --> 03:00:54.517]  They get you there and it's taped.
[03:00:54.517 --> 03:00:56.098]  I'm not doing tape.
[03:00:56.098 --> 03:00:57.038]  They'll edit what I say.
[03:00:57.038 --> 03:00:57.839]  They're just so evil.
[03:00:58.817 --> 03:01:02.019]  I'm telling you folks, they have no rules now.
[03:01:02.019 --> 03:01:03.600]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:05.662]  We're at the top left-hand corner.
[03:01:05.662 --> 03:01:16.689]  And they've got Senators and the Democrats saying shutting down conservative sites that they call a disease is, quote, the survival of our democracy.
[03:01:16.689 --> 03:01:18.690]  Quote, depends on banning sites.
[03:01:18.690 --> 03:01:20.371]  That is so Orwellian.
[03:01:20.371 --> 03:01:22.553]  To save our democracy, which we're a republic,
[03:01:24.380 --> 03:01:27.623]  But regardless, democracy denotes rule of the people.
[03:01:27.623 --> 03:01:34.830]  They're saying ban us preemptively ahead of the election, or we're going to destroy the democracy.
[03:01:34.830 --> 03:01:38.814]  No, they mean the corrupt Democratic Party in bed with the chi-comps.
[03:01:38.814 --> 03:01:39.815]  What else would you like to add?
[03:01:39.815 --> 03:01:42.477]  I know you've got some other big breaking news, Roger.
[03:01:42.477 --> 03:01:45.721]  Well, Alex, you're exactly right here.
[03:01:45.721 --> 03:01:47.803]  What happened to the civil libertarians?
[03:01:47.803 --> 03:01:48.964]  What happened to that?
[03:01:53.116 --> 03:01:59.598]  That's what's so perplexing here.
[03:01:59.598 --> 03:02:04.679]  You don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says to agree he has a right to say it.
[03:02:04.679 --> 03:02:08.841]  That's the most key element of a free society.
[03:02:08.841 --> 03:02:11.621]  But I think that their silencing us is strategic.
[03:02:11.621 --> 03:02:13.222]  Not only are you a test case, but
[03:02:13.945 --> 03:02:16.267]  Well, they plan to try to take Trump down.
[03:02:16.267 --> 03:02:18.408]  They probably plan to try to take me down.
[03:02:18.408 --> 03:02:21.470]  They may be planning to take you down.
[03:02:21.470 --> 03:02:24.633]  They are breaking me with legal fees.
[03:02:24.633 --> 03:02:33.079]  My close associate, Kristen Davis, friend of many years, is testifying for the grand jury voluntarily last week, next week.
[03:02:33.839 --> 03:02:40.484]  I did not leak that, neither that she was going or the day, but somebody did.
[03:02:40.484 --> 03:02:42.306]  And she is a friend of mine.
[03:02:42.306 --> 03:02:47.730]  She's aware of no Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or anything of the kind.
[03:02:47.730 --> 03:02:54.315]  It's just like the phony lawsuits against InfoWars that will, in the end, cost millions of dollars.
[03:02:54.315 --> 03:03:00.960]  It's an effort to frame us based on things you never said, and in my case, things I never did.
[03:03:03.066 --> 03:03:04.748]  We've got to get Trump.
[03:03:04.748 --> 03:03:06.689]  He doesn't want to look like he's meddling in the election.
[03:03:06.689 --> 03:03:08.731]  It's the Democrats that are doing it.
[03:03:08.731 --> 03:03:10.493]  That's always been their plan.
[03:03:10.493 --> 03:03:12.174]  And we've got to move against these people.
[03:03:12.174 --> 03:03:13.616]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:03:13.616 --> 03:03:15.017]  They kicked our email off today.
[03:03:15.017 --> 03:03:20.002]  They kicked our websprout, where we share stuff, a bunch of other stuff.
[03:03:20.002 --> 03:03:25.527]  And they're sending emails to everybody I know saying, you'll be arrested if you keep working with Alex Jones from fake emails.
[03:03:25.527 --> 03:03:27.869]  So they've got a big harassment campaign going right now.
[03:03:28.442 --> 03:03:32.043]  No, but this is just the most important beachhead in overall war.
[03:03:32.043 --> 03:03:36.384]  Look what they've done to Mike Savage, who I think is a real patriot and a good man.
[03:03:36.384 --> 03:03:41.765]  They have played all kinds of games with him online, trying to limit his reach.
[03:03:41.765 --> 03:03:44.485]  He is a real beacon for freedom, in my opinion.
[03:03:44.485 --> 03:03:47.166]  Well, that's why I told Savage a couple years ago.
[03:03:47.166 --> 03:03:49.086]  We never got around to it.
[03:03:49.086 --> 03:03:51.647]  I told him, I said, listen, he wanted to do it too.
[03:03:51.647 --> 03:03:55.728]  We'll talk about it on air maybe, but work with me some, and then just people get in the middle of it.
[03:03:55.728 --> 03:03:57.368]  But I mean, I just want to magnify everybody.
[03:03:58.526 --> 03:04:02.089]  And a lot of talk show hosts, other talk shows can't work with me because they're so competitive.
[03:04:02.089 --> 03:04:05.131]  Savage understood it, but still some of the corporates didn't like it.
[03:04:05.131 --> 03:04:06.672]  But I just want to promote everybody.
[03:04:06.672 --> 03:04:07.553]  I don't care who they are.
[03:04:07.553 --> 03:04:10.455]  I don't care if they're a man, a woman, whatever they are.
[03:04:10.455 --> 03:04:13.918]  If they're for freedom, then I want to magnify everybody.
[03:04:13.918 --> 03:04:15.319]  We're in a war.
[03:04:15.319 --> 03:04:18.041]  And I think people now have figured that out.
[03:04:18.041 --> 03:04:20.303]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:04:20.303 --> 03:04:22.765]  More important than ever, folks, to follow you there on your own website.
[03:04:23.425 --> 03:04:25.206]  So any way you're able to get stuff out, it'll still be there.
[03:04:25.206 --> 03:04:28.488]  StoneColdTruth.com, I'm InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:04:28.488 --> 03:04:30.989]  It won't get as censored as BadSharingNewsWars.com.
[03:04:30.989 --> 03:04:32.930]  That's why we have it there for you.
[03:04:32.930 --> 03:04:34.551]  That'll get thousands of retweets.
[03:04:34.551 --> 03:04:37.112]  InfoWars will get hundreds because it's shadow banned.
[03:04:37.112 --> 03:04:39.634]  So there's ways to get around this if folks just think about it.
[03:04:39.634 --> 03:04:40.934]  All right, thank you, Roger Stone.
[03:04:40.934 --> 03:04:46.097]  Coming up, the media is now sharpening their knives for PJW.
[03:04:46.097 --> 03:04:49.339]  Tons of articles calling for his head on a planner.
[03:04:49.339 --> 03:04:49.839]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.141 --> 03:04:55.482]  We knew it was coming.
[03:04:55.482 --> 03:04:56.943]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:04:56.943 --> 03:05:09.811]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:05:10.191 --> 03:05:21.242]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:05:21.242 --> 03:05:30.130]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:05:30.791 --> 03:05:40.258]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:05:40.258 --> 03:05:52.386]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:05:52.386 --> 03:05:53.627]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:06:15.842 --> 03:06:24.109]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.109 --> 03:06:33.177]  If you go to Real Alex Jones, there's a little Twitter thing that Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz put out.
[03:06:34.315 --> 03:06:41.937]  That is a new hashtag Snapchat filter to get the word out about hashtag free speech and free InfoWars and I am Alex Jones.
[03:06:41.937 --> 03:06:43.338]  Some of the top things on Twitter right now.
[03:06:43.338 --> 03:06:54.781]  It's a little fun little program that's real popular where it puts a piece of tape over your mouth and says censorship when you talk about anything you're talking about and in the lower corner it says InfoWars.com.
[03:06:57.526 --> 03:07:00.609]  So that's the type of things that really reach out to the youth and others.
[03:07:00.609 --> 03:07:05.614]  So go download it right now for free at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[03:07:05.614 --> 03:07:10.559]  Paul's going to retweet it at Prison Planet on his Twitter as well.
[03:07:10.559 --> 03:07:13.842]  So Paul Joseph Watts is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:07:13.842 --> 03:07:21.950]  I wanted to talk to him a little bit up front about his overall 35,000 foot view about where this is going, what they're planning.
[03:07:23.183 --> 03:07:23.643]  I don't know.
[03:07:45.316 --> 03:07:46.998]  Brian Stelter has no ratings.
[03:07:46.998 --> 03:07:48.179]  CNN's dead already.
[03:07:48.179 --> 03:07:50.320]  It's a zombie that wants to claw us into the grave.
[03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:51.081]  The Crypt Keeper.
[03:07:51.081 --> 03:07:52.522]  I want no violence against Mueller.
[03:07:52.522 --> 03:07:55.925]  They're calling for my arrest on MSNBC.
[03:07:55.925 --> 03:08:02.671]  The guy that got found with a dead intern in his house, Joe Scarborough, in his government offices.
[03:08:02.671 --> 03:08:05.533]  They just shut the whole thing down with their brains bashed out.
[03:08:05.533 --> 03:08:06.754]  He's calling for me to be arrested.
[03:08:07.694 --> 03:08:12.818]  They really entered a new level and they're just policing around going, why is he still on a Google app?
[03:08:12.818 --> 03:08:17.142]  And this other app, which by the way, has gone to number four, number three, you name it.
[03:08:17.142 --> 03:08:19.284]  And so now, Paul, they want to police you.
[03:08:19.284 --> 03:08:23.367]  Paul Joseph Watson, number two star of Alex Jones Info Wars.
[03:08:23.367 --> 03:08:26.349]  Avoid social media purge for now.
[03:08:26.349 --> 03:08:27.771]  By John Levine.
[03:08:28.331 --> 03:08:45.101]  And it goes on from the rap, and so now they're salivating, salivating over you, and of course they'll never say what you did if they ban you, they'll maybe say you beat a baby up, like they said about me, and God not showed where the baby got beat up, or, you know, where I was mean to the poor little Muslims.
[03:08:45.501 --> 03:08:51.509]  So Paul, give us your take on this and what you think is about to happen because this is a signal they've been this bold.
[03:08:51.509 --> 03:08:55.594]  They're testing total deplatforming, total siege, total economic warfare.
[03:08:55.594 --> 03:08:57.297]  This means they're going for broke.
[03:08:57.297 --> 03:08:58.438]  I think trying to take Trump out.
[03:08:58.438 --> 03:08:58.839]  What do you think?
[03:09:00.658 --> 03:09:02.959]  Well, this is what they're trying to do, Alex.
[03:09:02.959 --> 03:09:06.021]  Obviously shifting the Overton window even further.
[03:09:06.021 --> 03:09:09.163]  They're probably not going to outright ban a bunch more people immediately.
[03:09:09.163 --> 03:09:10.344]  They will eventually, obviously.
[03:09:10.344 --> 03:09:11.485]  They'll ban everyone.
[03:09:11.485 --> 03:09:24.873]  But in the short term, this is about changing the Overton window, shifting the Overton window, to the point where Conservatives moderate their opinions, where they moderate their speech, just to ensure the survival of their platforms.
[03:09:24.873 --> 03:09:26.674]  So again, it's all a power play.
[03:09:26.674 --> 03:09:28.315]  It's intellectual castration.
[03:09:28.875 --> 03:09:34.196]  And, you know, it neutralizes them politically before the midterms, before the potential re-election of Trump.
[03:09:34.196 --> 03:09:35.897]  The other thing is LinkedIn.
[03:09:35.897 --> 03:09:39.698]  They deleted you from LinkedIn, Alex, yesterday, as you know.
[03:09:39.698 --> 03:09:46.380]  You don't, you cannot upload content to LinkedIn, so this whole hate speech argument falls completely flat.
[03:09:46.380 --> 03:09:52.861]  As Mike Adams is talking about, this is literally communist Chinese-style social credit score, 1984-style unpersoning.
[03:09:55.542 --> 03:09:57.163]  It's politically motivated.
[03:09:57.163 --> 03:09:59.805]  It was coordinated in the same 12-hour period.
[03:09:59.805 --> 03:10:03.927]  They even got you on Pinterest as well, obviously, and a bunch of other platforms.
[03:10:03.927 --> 03:10:06.449]  This is nothing to do with hate speech.
[03:10:06.449 --> 03:10:11.392]  That's the biggest lie about all this, because you cannot upload content to LinkedIn.
[03:10:11.392 --> 03:10:14.914]  So imagine if you had someone who said something controversial on the Internet.
[03:10:15.535 --> 03:10:17.417]  Then they get deleted from LinkedIn.
[03:10:17.417 --> 03:10:23.424]  Then they find it impossible to get a job because they're banned from simply being listed as a person.
[03:10:23.424 --> 03:10:26.007]  And that's exactly what China's doing.
[03:10:26.007 --> 03:10:27.388]  And they say the model's worldwide.
[03:10:27.388 --> 03:10:30.612]  We have a Google high-level whistleblower came out, as you know, last week saying,
[03:10:31.132 --> 03:10:34.753]  The secret search engine they're building for censorship is going to be used here.
[03:10:34.753 --> 03:10:35.913]  This is it.
[03:10:35.913 --> 03:10:37.454]  We had WebChimp banished today.
[03:10:37.454 --> 03:10:41.495]  We had this WebSprout banished.
[03:10:41.495 --> 03:10:45.176]  That's just a program you use to spread your stuff with your accounts.
[03:10:45.176 --> 03:10:48.077]  So yes, we're under total economic attack.
[03:10:48.077 --> 03:10:54.499]  This is true, true, beyond ghettos, electronic ghettos that Matt Drudge warned of.
[03:10:54.499 --> 03:10:58.300]  This is true racketeering not seen since the Nazis.
[03:10:59.741 --> 03:11:01.622]  Yeah, it's clearly election meddling.
[03:11:01.622 --> 03:11:05.185]  In fact, WikiLeaks tweeted out about 20 minutes ago, if they want to go and find it.
[03:11:30.214 --> 03:11:33.816]  Why on earth is this PJW tweet at the top of trending hashtags?
[03:11:33.816 --> 03:11:35.057]  This is fake news.
[03:11:35.057 --> 03:11:36.157]  It wasn't fake news.
[03:11:36.157 --> 03:11:38.699]  It was a completely accurate story.
[03:11:38.699 --> 03:11:46.703]  You cannot even claim it was inaccurate because it was about an imam in New York warning de Blasio about radicalization in New York mosques.
[03:11:47.123 --> 03:11:48.004]  He did warn him.
[03:11:48.004 --> 03:11:48.824]  He sent a letter.
[03:11:48.824 --> 03:11:50.526]  He posted the letter on Twitter.
[03:11:50.526 --> 03:11:51.626]  We embedded the letter.
[03:11:51.626 --> 03:11:54.268]  It was a completely factual story.
[03:11:54.268 --> 03:11:58.672]  Whether you think de Blasio had any reason to listen to that warning, not even the issue.
[03:11:58.672 --> 03:12:01.474]  The fact was, it wasn't fake news.
[03:12:01.474 --> 03:12:05.997]  Well, the same imam is a great guy and went on Fox News and warned about it.
[03:12:05.997 --> 03:12:09.860]  I mean, I don't even watch a lot of TV and I'd seen him on Fox News warning.
[03:12:11.010 --> 03:12:24.476]  So you have specific examples of genuine news that we reported being cited by Democrats in Congressional hearings as fake news and then used to pressure Twitter to relegate us in the algorithm, which they did.
[03:12:24.476 --> 03:12:26.717]  They said, yep, we've sorted it out, it's gone.
[03:12:26.717 --> 03:12:30.218]  So that's a clear example of how they're lying about this.
[03:12:30.218 --> 03:12:32.299]  You know, they banned Tommy Robinson on Instagram.
[03:12:32.299 --> 03:12:35.300]  His Instagram's come back now, by the way.
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:37.081]  You went on his Instagram, it's come back up.
[03:12:37.759 --> 03:12:40.302]  It's literally pictures of his kids and food.
[03:12:40.302 --> 03:12:42.144]  I mean, this is the level.
[03:12:42.144 --> 03:12:43.686]  This is unpersoning.
[03:12:43.686 --> 03:12:46.108]  This is straight out of 1984.
[03:12:46.108 --> 03:12:48.631]  Communist Chinese social credit score.
[03:12:48.631 --> 03:12:50.593]  And it's going to impact everyone.
[03:12:50.593 --> 03:12:54.378]  And the thing about YouTube is I posted a tweet about a week ago now.
[03:12:55.379 --> 03:13:08.448]  Pointing out that when they announced that they were going to relegate independent media content and boost mainstream media content, just by coincidence, the YouTube subscriptions for CNN, MSNBC, etc.
[03:13:08.448 --> 03:13:10.289]  started climbing rapidly.
[03:13:10.289 --> 03:13:12.630]  Their views started climbing rapidly.
[03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:14.732]  It's clear algorithm meddling.
[03:13:14.732 --> 03:13:16.273]  It's election rigging.
[03:13:16.273 --> 03:13:21.316]  And it's because in the case of YouTube, to be successful on YouTube, you have to have a personality.
[03:13:21.536 --> 03:13:27.257]  Okay, it takes hard work, it takes years to build up an audience, because they engage with your personality.
[03:13:27.257 --> 03:13:29.898]  Brian Stelter has no personality.
[03:13:29.898 --> 03:13:32.479]  Oliver Darcy of CNN has no personality.
[03:13:32.479 --> 03:13:44.401]  Other than, they all literally are the creepiest looking... If I was central casting for a Creepazoid, a serial killer, something like that, for a movie, I mean, you don't need to show him as a clown, just show Brian Stelter.
[03:13:44.401 --> 03:13:47.062]  I mean, he is a flaming Creepazoid.
[03:13:47.702 --> 03:13:50.303]  And then they're... I love how they bitch about Trump.
[03:13:50.303 --> 03:13:55.724]  He counter-punches them saying he's a Nazi, he's a criminal, he's a Russian agent, he should be removed.
[03:13:55.724 --> 03:13:58.805]  Saying you guys are fake news, you're enemies of American progress.
[03:13:58.805 --> 03:14:01.685]  And then they call for him to be banned, they call for us to be banned.
[03:14:01.685 --> 03:14:05.346]  While screeching we're trying to ban them, when we're not!
[03:14:05.346 --> 03:14:06.427]  I mean, God!
[03:14:06.427 --> 03:14:07.447]  It's ridiculous!
[03:14:08.931 --> 03:14:09.732]  Exactly.
[03:14:09.732 --> 03:14:18.617]  The only positive out of this, and it will take years, but these platforms, they're already echo chambers of people just shouting at each other and not even listening to each other.
[03:14:18.617 --> 03:14:22.019]  They're going to become increasingly stale, increasingly boring.
[03:14:22.019 --> 03:14:24.881]  We're bringing on a ton of young people to our message.
[03:14:24.881 --> 03:14:33.326]  They're going to avoid those platforms, and yes, it'll take years, but we're going to have to move to these different platforms finally and help build them from the ground up.
[03:14:33.326 --> 03:14:34.266]  Paul.
[03:14:34.266 --> 03:14:35.367]  Oh, that Dorsey guy.
[03:14:35.367 --> 03:14:36.207]  Dorsey.
[03:14:36.207 --> 03:14:36.648]  Incredible.
[03:14:37.921 --> 03:14:40.243]  He sends me comments, like, what do you want to make a comment?
[03:14:40.243 --> 03:14:47.531]  And it's always one minute after he publishes a story just to, like, gloat when they're the ones openly lobbying for us to be taken down.
[03:14:47.531 --> 03:14:54.378]  Since no one watches them, that's what they are, is a big corporate operating crew to kill free speech just like universities.
[03:14:54.378 --> 03:14:56.360]  And I have total satisfaction in knowing
[03:14:57.506 --> 03:14:58.927]  That they will be defeated.
[03:14:58.927 --> 03:14:59.908]  They will be brought down.
[03:14:59.908 --> 03:15:01.350]  They will be stopped by their own actions.
[03:15:01.350 --> 03:15:06.555]  But like you said, Paul, it is one hell of a time to be alive and Republicans need to wake up.
[03:15:06.555 --> 03:15:07.876]  People in the UK need to wake up.
[03:15:07.876 --> 03:15:09.038]  This is historical.
[03:15:09.038 --> 03:15:10.159]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:10.159 --> 03:15:11.440]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:12.421]  I want to ask you this question.
[03:15:12.421 --> 03:15:13.002]  I want you to answer it.
[03:15:13.002 --> 03:15:14.143]  When you come back, you're taking over.
[03:15:14.143 --> 03:15:14.583]  I'm done here.
[03:15:15.584 --> 03:15:18.185]  Why is Twitter leaving us up for now?
[03:15:18.185 --> 03:15:25.567]  Is it because they've already gotten called out by Congress a few weeks ago for copper shadow banning, and they don't want to be on the bandwagon?
[03:15:25.567 --> 03:15:29.568]  And since they were some of the worst censors, they're backing off right now.
[03:15:29.568 --> 03:15:34.190]  I don't know why, but I'm going to tell you, we've not violated any of their stupid rules.
[03:15:34.190 --> 03:15:36.970]  God, it's a total one-sided policy and very discriminatory.
[03:15:36.970 --> 03:15:44.653]  But whatever you do, listeners, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and the new app we launched three weeks ago is now, what, number three?
[03:15:45.413 --> 03:15:46.798]  In the news apps.
[03:15:46.798 --> 03:15:51.252]  It was already in the top 30, but it's going to go to number one, I believe, if you download it and tell folks to download it.
[03:15:51.252 --> 03:15:51.814]  So do that.
[03:15:51.814 --> 03:15:52.336]  People power.
[03:15:53.322 --> 03:15:54.543]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.543 --> 03:15:58.466]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.466 --> 03:16:00.007]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.007 --> 03:16:02.969]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.969 --> 03:16:08.533]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.533 --> 03:16:09.734]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.734 --> 03:16:12.656]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.656 --> 03:16:14.898]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.898 --> 03:16:19.341]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.341 --> 03:16:21.623]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[03:20:05.057 --> 03:20:09.500]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:13.823]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.823 --> 03:20:16.185]  Okay, so Paul Watson's taking over right now, but Paul...
[03:20:18.368 --> 03:20:19.509]  It is Twilight Zone.
[03:20:19.509 --> 03:20:27.832]  I mean, what is it like to be, we've been working together for 15 years, 16 years, to be at the very epicenter of global free speech debate.
[03:20:27.832 --> 03:20:30.213]  Top links all over Drudge every day.
[03:20:30.213 --> 03:20:35.596]  Congressional hearings calling us disease, lying about us, and then not showing what we said.
[03:20:36.656 --> 03:20:40.917]  I mean, there's a rally around us happening right now, but it needs to be bigger.
[03:20:40.917 --> 03:20:43.057]  And Trump needs to take action right now.
[03:20:43.057 --> 03:20:53.239]  I mean, this is wild ahead of these midterms to set the precedent to deny services to patriots and nationalists across the board, Paul.
[03:20:53.239 --> 03:20:55.800]  This is an amazing, amazing time to be alive.
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:21:00.461]  And I just hope listeners and viewers realize the power that you have individually.
[03:21:00.461 --> 03:21:05.342]  They failed with the big social networks that were meant to spy on you and control you and Google.
[03:21:06.175 --> 03:21:06.295]  That's
[03:21:24.244 --> 03:21:36.449]  The fact that they're having to do this shows the true crisis because people took over the algorithm and now once a human isn't an animal, in the classical animal sense, we have free will.
[03:21:36.449 --> 03:21:43.613]  And once we're willing to go through pain or attacks or whatever and tell the truth, there's no putting your system back together again.
[03:21:43.613 --> 03:21:44.873]  A, do you agree with that?
[03:21:44.873 --> 03:21:46.314]  B, what are they going to do now?
[03:21:46.894 --> 03:21:51.818]  That even a lot of the internal polls show still a big win for Republicans if people vote and take action.
[03:21:51.818 --> 03:21:52.979]  What are they going to do, Paul?
[03:21:52.979 --> 03:21:55.721]  Because this all smells of real desperation.
[03:21:55.721 --> 03:21:58.123]  I mean, jumping the shark?
[03:21:58.123 --> 03:22:00.084]  Admitting ban info wars?
[03:22:00.084 --> 03:22:01.866]  I mean, we are now legendary.
[03:22:01.866 --> 03:22:04.227]  They're going to try to demonize us and destroy us.
[03:22:04.227 --> 03:22:08.611]  And everybody is starting to rally to our cause, though, like they should have, because people now get it.
[03:22:10.976 --> 03:22:13.777]  Well, here's the other aspect, Alex, which you might not have heard about.
[03:22:13.777 --> 03:22:27.143]  A few weeks ago, Facebook banned accounts because they said they, quote, sought to inflame social and political tensions in the United States, which is what the left does on a second-by-second basis by literally calling to harass Trump supporters and Trump cabinet members.
[03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:32.013]  But this was done after Facebook, and this is in Rolling Stone, by the way.
[03:22:32.013 --> 03:22:36.417]  This is a liberal publication by Matt Taibbi, who actually defended you.
[03:22:36.417 --> 03:22:54.732]  Facebook was helped in its efforts to wipe out these dangerous memes by the Atlantic Council, on whose board you'll find confidence-inspiring names like Henry Kissinger, former CIA Chief Michael Hayden, former acting CIA head Michael Morell, and former Bush-era Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff.
[03:22:54.732 --> 03:22:56.313]  So this was the deep state
[03:22:56.813 --> 03:23:07.419]  This wasn't just social media companies in the far left, this was the deep state itself working with Facebook to ban these pages because they inflamed political tensions.
[03:23:07.419 --> 03:23:14.263]  Similar to how, as he said in Brazil, Bolsonaro, who is number one in the polls, they call him the Brazilian Trump, he's probably going to win.
[03:23:14.263 --> 03:23:17.785]  They banned a network of pages that supported him.
[03:23:17.785 --> 03:23:22.167]  They banned 30,000 pro-Le Pen accounts before the French election.
[03:23:22.167 --> 03:23:23.668]  It worked on that occasion.
[03:23:23.668 --> 03:23:24.729]  But this is a direct link.
[03:23:25.393 --> 03:23:41.066]  What I want to know is what conversations went on behind the scenes for this to be a coordinated campaign and did they involve the Atlantic Council given we know those conversations took place before Facebook banned these accounts a few weeks ago.
[03:23:41.066 --> 03:23:43.368]  So it's this whole, oh it's just a private company.
[03:23:43.368 --> 03:23:43.888]  No it isn't.
[03:23:43.888 --> 03:23:45.830]  They're literally working with lawmakers.
[03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:50.353]  They're working with the deep state itself to crush free speech.
[03:23:50.353 --> 03:23:52.675]  This is not a private company argument.
[03:23:52.675 --> 03:23:53.196]  This is about
[03:23:53.816 --> 03:24:06.939]  Social media being the new public commons, and that's why we need people like Brad Parscale to merely tweet about it would be nice, and some kind of executive action, a digital online Bill of Rights, because this has just got out of control.
[03:24:06.939 --> 03:24:16.361]  Yeah, I'm going to continue the show because Alex is gone now, but this is an article out Rolling Stone I just mentioned.
[03:24:16.361 --> 03:24:19.442]  Matt Taibbi, beware the slippery slope of Facebook censorship.
[03:24:20.265 --> 03:24:27.179]  He outlines the fact that they were in discussions with Deep State, with Kissinger, Hayden, Morrell, Chertoff.
[03:24:27.179 --> 03:24:30.105]  He continues to say, when Facebook works with the government,
[03:24:30.948 --> 03:24:45.958]  And wannabe star chamber organisations like the Atlantic Council to delete sites on national security grounds using secret methodology, it opens the door to nightmare possibilities that you'd find in dystopian novels.
[03:24:45.958 --> 03:24:55.184]  Okay, that's not Alex Jones saying that, that's Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone magazine, somebody who hates him for wars and hates Alex Jones, but even he came to our defence.
[03:24:55.842 --> 03:25:02.848]  He said the sheer, this is key, the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the real threat.
[03:25:02.848 --> 03:25:07.992]  This is why breaking them up should have long ago become an urgent national priority.
[03:25:07.992 --> 03:25:08.933]  They're a monopoly.
[03:25:09.835 --> 03:25:17.679]  He continues, instead, as was obvious during the Senate hearing with Mark Zuckerberg, politicians are more interested in using them to curtail the power of these companies.
[03:25:17.679 --> 03:25:21.402]  The platforms for their part will cave rather than be regulated.
[03:25:21.402 --> 03:25:22.742]  The endgame couldn't be clearer.
[03:25:22.742 --> 03:25:27.485]  This is how authoritarian marriages begin and people should be very worried.
[03:25:28.266 --> 03:25:29.707]  You mentioned Zuckerberg.
[03:25:29.707 --> 03:25:35.289]  They asked Zuckerberg to define hate speech in that infamous hearing back a couple of months ago.
[03:25:35.289 --> 03:25:36.670]  He couldn't do it.
[03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:38.771]  He couldn't define what hate speech was.
[03:25:38.771 --> 03:25:42.993]  So how does Facebook know what hate speech is when they ban InfoWars?
[03:25:42.993 --> 03:25:48.656]  When they provide zero specific examples of what we said to ban InfoWars?
[03:25:48.656 --> 03:25:51.637]  You've got a situation in Europe where the European Union again
[03:25:52.333 --> 03:26:03.937]  A government body, the government of Germany, other governments in Europe, are working with social media companies, not only to censor free speech on social media, but then police action is involved.
[03:26:03.937 --> 03:26:06.558]  These people get home visits from the police.
[03:26:06.558 --> 03:26:07.618]  They're prosecuted.
[03:26:08.198 --> 03:26:10.418]  In Sweden this is an even bigger problem.
[03:26:10.418 --> 03:26:18.300]  They're prosecuted, interrogated, if they criticize Islamic immigration for example, and in some cases literally put in prison.
[03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:31.902]  Okay, when you've got the government working with big industry to not only quash people's rights but to put them in prison for what they say on the internet, that is not my private company argument anymore.
[03:26:31.902 --> 03:26:35.363]  That is authoritarian political oppression.
[03:26:36.013 --> 03:26:38.360]  And it's happening across the West.
[03:26:38.360 --> 03:26:39.945]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:26:39.945 --> 03:26:41.790]  And now, as Rolling Stone magazine reports...
[03:26:42.668 --> 03:26:47.331]  Deep state individuals are working with Facebook to crush freedom of speech.
[03:26:47.331 --> 03:26:50.672]  To ban pages that quote inflame political tensions.
[03:26:50.672 --> 03:26:54.174]  You could say anything inflames political tensions.
[03:26:54.174 --> 03:26:57.816]  You have a disagreement with somebody on Facebook about a political issue.
[03:26:57.816 --> 03:27:00.458]  That inflames political tensions.
[03:27:00.458 --> 03:27:01.879]  It could be anything.
[03:27:01.879 --> 03:27:06.961]  It's entirely subjective and that's why this is so dangerous.
[03:27:06.961 --> 03:27:08.042]  Breitbart reports.
[03:27:09.016 --> 03:27:13.882]  By the way, we've got Ezra Levant coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about this, more rebel media owner.
[03:27:13.882 --> 03:27:19.869]  Breitbart reports zero transparency, six questions that tech giants refuse to answer about the Infowars ban.
[03:27:20.535 --> 03:27:26.938]  Number one, what content specifically from InfoWars Alex Jones was found to be hate speech and otherwise rule-breaking?
[03:27:26.938 --> 03:27:31.040]  They did not cite any specific example.
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:34.142]  Two, when was the decision to ban them made?
[03:27:34.142 --> 03:27:39.345]  What changed over the course of a few days from when you defended not banning InfoWars content?
[03:27:39.345 --> 03:27:45.888]  Because remember, Facebook came out when CNN was at the height of this lobbying campaign to silence their competition.
[03:27:45.888 --> 03:27:48.769]  Again, in places like Russia, the government shuts down the media.
[03:27:48.769 --> 03:27:50.090]  In America, CNN does it.
[03:27:50.856 --> 03:27:52.657]  They asked Facebook about this.
[03:27:52.657 --> 03:27:54.799]  Facebook said we support free speech.
[03:27:54.799 --> 03:27:56.100]  What changed?
[03:27:56.100 --> 03:27:57.381]  What changed, Facebook?
[03:27:57.381 --> 03:28:01.543]  What secret conversations were going on behind the scenes?
[03:28:01.543 --> 03:28:04.205]  Question number three remains unanswered.
[03:28:04.205 --> 03:28:06.487]  Who made the decision to take down InfoWars?
[03:28:07.182 --> 03:28:11.147]  It's unlikely that the decision to ban InfoWars was taken by a rank-and-file content reviewer.
[03:28:11.147 --> 03:28:12.789]  Again, all coordinated.
[03:28:12.789 --> 03:28:16.954]  Spotify, Apple, Pinterest, Facebook, Google, YouTube.
[03:28:16.954 --> 03:28:19.938]  All coordinated within 12 hours of each other.
[03:28:19.938 --> 03:28:22.381]  This was a coordinated purge.
[03:28:22.381 --> 03:28:25.044]  It wasn't an enforcement of terms of service.
[03:28:25.044 --> 03:28:26.706]  That is a lie.
[03:28:27.226 --> 03:28:33.390]  Number four, will you provide clear guidelines on hate speech, including defining hate speech in a manner that is clear to all users?
[03:28:33.390 --> 03:28:38.054]  Because at this point, hate speech is anything that they disagree with.
[03:28:38.054 --> 03:28:41.296]  This is politically motivated censorship.
[03:28:41.296 --> 03:28:42.537]  This is the purge.
[03:28:42.537 --> 03:28:43.958]  We have arrived.
[03:28:43.958 --> 03:28:49.241]  We'll be back in the next segment with Rebel Media owner Ezra Levant to talk about big tech censorship.
[03:28:49.241 --> 03:28:49.942]  Don't go away.
[03:28:49.942 --> 03:28:51.243]  InfoWars.com.
[03:28:51.243 --> 03:28:51.643]  Get the app.
[03:28:53.444 --> 03:28:55.385]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.385 --> 03:29:00.706]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.706 --> 03:29:02.286]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.286 --> 03:29:10.648]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.648 --> 03:29:16.330]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:18.331]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:18.331 --> 03:29:20.612]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.612 --> 03:29:25.013]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:25.013 --> 03:29:27.194]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.194 --> 03:29:35.057]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:29:35.157 --> 03:29:40.882]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:29:40.882 --> 03:29:41.202]  It's you!
[03:30:03.317 --> 03:30:05.519]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:30:05.519 --> 03:30:14.228]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.228 --> 03:30:18.813]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.813 --> 03:30:20.274]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.274 --> 03:30:23.798]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.478 --> 03:30:35.862]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.862 --> 03:30:43.825]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.825 --> 03:30:50.868]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:50.868 --> 03:30:53.609]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[03:30:53.909 --> 03:31:00.413]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[03:31:00.413 --> 03:31:07.237]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:31:07.237 --> 03:31:22.766]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:31:23.928 --> 03:31:27.751]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:31:27.751 --> 03:31:32.994]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:31:32.994 --> 03:31:34.295]  And here's the best part.
[03:31:34.295 --> 03:31:36.136]  It is absolutely free.
[03:31:36.136 --> 03:31:41.340]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:45.302]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:31:45.302 --> 03:31:49.425]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:31:49.425 --> 03:31:53.528]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:31:54.148 --> 03:31:55.509]  We knew it was coming.
[03:31:55.509 --> 03:31:56.949]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:31:56.949 --> 03:32:10.214]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:32:10.214 --> 03:32:19.817]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten
[03:32:20.177 --> 03:32:21.238]  News Feeds.
[03:32:21.238 --> 03:32:24.240]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:32:24.240 --> 03:32:26.121]  Subscribe to the free podcast.

[03:32:27.182 --> 03:32:30.825]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:32:30.825 --> 03:32:40.271]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:32:40.271 --> 03:32:44.074]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:32:44.574 --> 03:32:47.276]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:32:47.276 --> 03:32:52.381]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:32:52.381 --> 03:32:57.205]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:32:57.205 --> 03:32:59.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.037 --> 03:33:14.060]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.060 --> 03:33:18.382]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:18.382 --> 03:33:24.865]  You're back on the most censored news show in the Western Hemisphere.
[03:33:24.865 --> 03:33:27.586]  And now I'm delighted to be joined by my guest, Ezra Levant.
[03:33:27.586 --> 03:33:31.588]  He is the owner of Rebel Media, the rebel.media.
[03:33:31.588 --> 03:33:32.448]  Ezra, welcome.
[03:33:33.497 --> 03:33:34.738]  Thanks very much.
[03:33:34.738 --> 03:33:38.760]  This is a dark day for freedom, and of course they're coming for InfoWars today.
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:43.462]  Tomorrow will be Breitbart and The Rebel, and after that, Fox News.
[03:33:43.462 --> 03:33:47.344]  Now, I want to get into this, Ezra, because you did a series of tweets about this yesterday.
[03:33:47.344 --> 03:33:51.126]  Addressing this, oh, it's just a private company, they can ban who they like argument.
[03:33:51.126 --> 03:33:57.109]  Okay, you've got governments working in concert with big tech in Europe to prosecute hate speech.
[03:33:57.109 --> 03:33:59.610]  People literally having a knock on their door from the police.
[03:33:59.610 --> 03:34:01.751]  They're prosecuted, fined, sent to prison.
[03:34:02.051 --> 03:34:04.993]  For what they say on Facebook on many occasions.
[03:34:04.993 --> 03:34:11.496]  You've got MPs in Britain with Tommy Robinson having meetings with social media companies demanding his censorship.
[03:34:11.496 --> 03:34:18.079]  You've got Democratic lawmakers in the US, Deutch and Quigley, demanding that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube censor InfoWars.
[03:34:18.079 --> 03:34:25.864]  Today we've got Democratic Senator Murphy asserting that this should just be the beginning and that other conservative news websites should be censored.
[03:34:25.864 --> 03:34:28.865]  Given that this was all done, Ezra, to InfoWars within a 12-hour time frame,
[03:34:31.344 --> 03:34:36.187]  This wasn't enforcement of terms of service, was it?
[03:34:36.187 --> 03:34:51.057]  How likely is it, in your view, when you tweet about this, that in addition to all the public lobbying on behalf of CNN, etc, that there was private lobbying going on behind the scenes to have InfoWars banned, and that that's why this happened in such a small time frame?
[03:34:52.350 --> 03:34:54.491]  Oh, it's not even a question of if.
[03:34:54.491 --> 03:34:56.111]  It's a certainty.
[03:34:56.111 --> 03:34:59.952]  In Canada, there was a story that leaked out earlier this year.
[03:34:59.952 --> 03:35:07.415]  Justin Trudeau, our Prime Minister, personally threatened Sheryl Sandberg, the Chief Operating Officer of Facebook.
[03:35:07.415 --> 03:35:09.956]  He told her that if she did not censor
[03:35:11.525 --> 03:35:18.710]  Political opinions, conservative opinions that he deemed fake news in advance of the 2019 Canadian election.
[03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:24.033]  If she didn't do that for him, he would do that to her through regulation.
[03:35:24.033 --> 03:35:29.277]  So this was reported in the largest newspaper in Canada, a liberal newspaper by the way.
[03:35:29.277 --> 03:35:35.081]  And of course, I'm not sure if you've actually watched it Paul, but a parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom
[03:35:35.641 --> 03:35:38.823]  They had a YouTube spokesman and they were swarming him.
[03:35:38.823 --> 03:35:40.003]  Why won't you ban that?
[03:35:40.003 --> 03:35:41.364]  Why won't you ban that?
[03:35:41.364 --> 03:35:43.365]  Why do I have to see Tommy Robinson this and that?
[03:35:43.365 --> 03:35:47.267]  I know Tommy Robinson has done some work with InfoWars.
[03:35:47.267 --> 03:35:49.868]  So these MPs do not even hide.
[03:35:50.749 --> 03:35:54.831]  Their demand that social media companies act as censors.
[03:35:54.831 --> 03:36:01.315]  It's a very clever move, and I'm not sure if they learned it from China, but there's two ways to censor someone.
[03:36:01.315 --> 03:36:13.842]  You could send a policeman, you could send a lawyer, sort of what they did to Tommy Robinson, but that's expensive, and that's embarrassing, and there's processes and appeals, and it's messy.
[03:36:13.842 --> 03:36:14.863]  On the other hand, you can just
[03:36:15.811 --> 03:36:26.636]  Have a company make a private decision, no warning, no explanation, no appeal, no puff of smoke, and you just un-person someone.
[03:36:26.636 --> 03:36:33.959]  And that's what happened in France shortly after Brexit, and then Donald Trump was elected in 2016.
[03:36:33.959 --> 03:36:39.621]  The next big election was France, and all of a sudden Mark Zuckerberg deleted
[03:36:40.350 --> 03:36:49.372]  Not 1, not 10, not 30, but 30,000 Facebook pages in France that supported Marine Le Pen.
[03:36:49.372 --> 03:36:50.553]  There was no hearing.
[03:36:50.553 --> 03:36:52.253]  We have no transparency.
[03:36:52.253 --> 03:36:54.734]  Did Emmanuel Macron just give a list to Zuckerberg?
[03:36:54.734 --> 03:36:57.935]  Did Zuckerberg just use some machine algorithm?
[03:36:57.935 --> 03:37:06.097]  We don't know, but imagine if France had tried to prosecute 30,000 hate criminals, if they had tried to use the instruments of the state.
[03:37:06.778 --> 03:37:10.343]  But instead, they just picked up the phone to Zuckerberg and said, do it.
[03:37:10.343 --> 03:37:17.374]  And Zuckerberg's in peril because, of course, Facebook, Google, these companies are constantly being hyperregulated.
[03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:22.472]  I think it was Google that was just fined $5 billion by the European Union.
[03:37:22.472 --> 03:37:24.414]  So there's a quid pro quo.
[03:37:24.414 --> 03:37:30.038]  You censor our political enemies, and maybe we won't crack down on your tax avoidance.
[03:37:30.038 --> 03:37:32.840]  Maybe we won't hold you responsible for hate speech.
[03:37:32.840 --> 03:37:44.649]  If you let the Tommy Robinsons and the Alex Joneses and the Paul Joseph Watsons of the world continue, well, then expect a lot of scrutiny and we may prosecute you corporately for hate speech.
[03:37:44.649 --> 03:37:47.892]  So these companies, I don't let them off the hook at all.
[03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:52.436]  But they are in a crony relationship.
[03:37:52.436 --> 03:37:55.921]  They are in a symbiosis with government.
[03:37:55.921 --> 03:37:57.664]  They do government's dirty work.
[03:37:57.664 --> 03:38:03.733]  Government outsources censorship to them and they get unlisted benefits in return.
[03:38:05.094 --> 03:38:12.638]  And the other example of that is in Brazil, where you have Bolsonaro, who they call the Brazilian Trump, he's the populist, leading in the polls.
[03:38:12.638 --> 03:38:20.801]  A network, an entire network of huge pro-Bolsonaro accounts shut down by Facebook just a couple of months before their election.
[03:38:20.801 --> 03:38:23.883]  This is clearly collusion, clearly election meddling.
[03:38:23.883 --> 03:38:26.484]  And the other aspect of it is the unpersoning.
[03:38:26.864 --> 03:38:33.727]  The Chinese social credit score aspect of this because Alex Jones has been banned on LinkedIn.
[03:38:33.727 --> 03:38:36.808]  Okay, this is just a profile of individuals.
[03:38:36.808 --> 03:38:40.609]  You cannot upload media content to LinkedIn.
[03:38:40.609 --> 03:38:54.254]  So that, doesn't that throw the whole hate speech argument out of the window and prove that this was a coordinated tech purge to un-person 1984 style Alex Jones completely to then create this mob outrage wave
[03:38:54.774 --> 03:38:58.597]  Which would have him de-platformed on every other platform.
[03:38:58.597 --> 03:39:10.066]  Yeah, I mean, if you remember in 1984, Winston was working in the Ministry of Truth where he would change newspaper headlines historically.
[03:39:10.066 --> 03:39:16.710]  He would go back and change newspapers so that they were always at war with this country instead of that country.
[03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:22.675]  And they would throw the old stories down the memory hole.
[03:39:23.792 --> 03:39:25.473]  That's what it was called.
[03:39:25.473 --> 03:39:28.775]  They are trying to throw Alex Jones and Infowars down the memory hole.
[03:39:28.775 --> 03:39:34.479]  What's so incredible is his entire repertoire of work.
[03:39:34.479 --> 03:39:37.621]  And, you know, people can object to this or that.
[03:39:37.621 --> 03:39:40.884]  And Facebook might say, well, this post breaks this rule.
[03:39:40.884 --> 03:39:43.265]  And YouTube might say, well, that actually breaks this law.
[03:39:43.265 --> 03:39:44.666]  They could.
[03:39:44.666 --> 03:39:50.030]  But to throw more than a decade's, his whole body of work out
[03:39:50.983 --> 03:40:00.569]  Including countless innocuous or historically valuable interviews with political leaders, with activists, just to delete it all.
[03:40:00.569 --> 03:40:05.172]  You know, let me share with you, I don't know how many minutes we have, interrupt me if I'm going on too long.
[03:40:05.172 --> 03:40:11.235]  There was an ancient Roman concept, I'm going to say it in Latin, damnatio memoriae.
[03:40:11.235 --> 03:40:17.019]  If I'm pronouncing it right, it means to damn the memory of a political enemy.
[03:40:17.019 --> 03:40:18.380]  Sometimes it was an emperor,
[03:40:19.065 --> 03:40:21.806]  Who got into a quarrel with his brother, killed his brother.
[03:40:21.806 --> 03:40:26.007]  Well, he had to erase not just the crime, but any mention of that person.
[03:40:26.007 --> 03:40:30.849]  So any paintings, that person's face had to be scraped out.
[03:40:30.849 --> 03:40:33.590]  Any sculptures had to be destroyed.
[03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:36.831]  Any laws passed by that person were annulled.
[03:40:36.831 --> 03:40:40.712]  It's like the Stalinist tactic of removing someone from a photo.
[03:40:40.712 --> 03:40:45.314]  What we're seeing by tech companies is a damnatio memoriae.
[03:40:46.090 --> 03:41:00.234]  And soon you'll type in Alex Jones in a Google search engine or InfoWars and maybe Breitbart and maybe one day Paul Joseph Watson and Ezra Levant and nothing will show up and people will say, did that happen?
[03:41:00.234 --> 03:41:01.894]  Do I remember that right?
[03:41:01.894 --> 03:41:03.395]  Or was it thrown down the memory hole?
[03:41:03.395 --> 03:41:06.936]  Because I can't even read the record for myself.
[03:41:06.936 --> 03:41:10.017]  I can't even see what was said for myself.
[03:41:10.017 --> 03:41:11.617]  Oh, well, it was probably just a rumor.
[03:41:13.470 --> 03:41:17.814]  Yeah, who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past.
[03:41:17.814 --> 03:41:20.356]  Meanwhile, this gets to the same point.
[03:41:20.356 --> 03:41:24.060]  They're literally attempting to amend reality in real time.
[03:41:24.060 --> 03:41:34.689]  We have this Sarah Jong hired to the New York Times editorial board after a series of racist tweets which the New York Times admitted they'd seen and knew about before the interview.
[03:41:34.689 --> 03:41:36.010]  So they still hired her.
[03:41:36.010 --> 03:41:37.732]  She had the right consensus mindset.
[03:41:38.391 --> 03:41:59.085]  Her Wikipedia page, that controversy, which was in the news for days last week, one of the biggest stories in America, obviously the biggest issue of her career, of her as a person, and it's completely excised from her Wikipedia page because it's basically run by hysterical far-left editors.
[03:41:59.085 --> 03:42:08.091]  So again, it goes to the heart of, they're literally changing not just history, but the nature of immediate reality itself to try and hide their own hypocrisy.
[03:42:09.190 --> 03:42:09.670]  Yeah.
[03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:24.056]  You know, Paul, when I was a student and I was learning about politics and philosophy and economics, like a lot of young people, I thought libertarianism was appealing and property rights and, you know, like many young people.
[03:42:24.056 --> 03:42:28.338]  And so the traditional libertarian argument would be, oh, well, these are private companies.
[03:42:28.338 --> 03:42:30.139]  If you don't like it, start your own.
[03:42:30.945 --> 03:42:43.195]  But the idea of starting your own Facebook, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, start your own internet, that's about as likely, and I'm borrowing this line from Michael Tracy, who's a principled leftist on this issue.
[03:42:43.195 --> 03:42:48.359]  He says, starting your own internet is about as possible as telling someone in the 1890s
[03:42:49.780 --> 03:42:52.701]  We don't like buying oil from Standard Oil and J.D.
[03:42:52.701 --> 03:42:53.041]  Rockefeller.
[03:42:53.041 --> 03:42:57.163]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:42:57.163 --> 03:43:04.226]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:44:21.273 --> 03:44:22.534]  Winter Sun is the result

[03:44:53.955 --> 03:45:04.542]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.542 --> 03:45:06.604]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.604 --> 03:45:09.466]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.466 --> 03:45:10.967]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:10.967 --> 03:45:14.089]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:45:14.329 --> 03:45:14.750]  Absolutely.
[03:45:34.673 --> 03:45:46.387]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:46:57.136 --> 03:46:59.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.294 --> 03:47:12.459]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:12.459 --> 03:47:15.266]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.266 --> 03:47:18.934]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:20.703 --> 03:47:27.606]  We're back live on the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere right now with Ezra Levant of Rebel Media.
[03:47:27.606 --> 03:47:30.607]  Just going to read this quote from Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi.
[03:47:30.607 --> 03:47:41.432]  A liberal, one of the few real liberals left, no fan of Infowars, he said, quote, the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the real threat.
[03:47:41.432 --> 03:47:46.134]  This is why breaking them up should have long ago become an urgent national priority.
[03:47:46.634 --> 03:47:49.557]  Ezra, you were finishing up with a Michael Tracy quote there.
[03:47:49.557 --> 03:47:53.440]  And people say, oh, you're banned on Facebook, you're banned on YouTube, you're banned on wherever.
[03:47:53.440 --> 03:47:55.903]  Why don't you just start your own social media network?
[03:47:55.903 --> 03:47:58.285]  Because that's really simple and easy, isn't it?
[03:47:58.285 --> 03:47:59.546]  You don't need much money to do that.
[03:47:59.546 --> 03:48:00.687]  You don't need much resources.
[03:48:01.283 --> 03:48:03.545]  What's your answer to that?
[03:48:03.545 --> 03:48:11.010]  It would be like someone a hundred years ago saying, you know, the railway, the steel, the coal, the oil is all owned by J.D.
[03:48:11.010 --> 03:48:11.851]  Rockefeller.
[03:48:11.851 --> 03:48:15.113]  I have to deal with his monopoly and he's busting me up.
[03:48:15.113 --> 03:48:18.195]  Oh, just start your own railroad.
[03:48:18.195 --> 03:48:20.817]  Start your own bank, your own refinery.
[03:48:20.817 --> 03:48:22.678]  It's impossible to do.
[03:48:22.678 --> 03:48:23.179]  But of course,
[03:48:24.294 --> 03:48:28.575]  Steel, oil, coal, that's all important.
[03:48:28.575 --> 03:48:33.997]  But it didn't control our information, our mind, our perception, our politics.
[03:48:33.997 --> 03:48:41.819]  The dominance by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg is unparalleled.
[03:48:41.819 --> 03:48:44.220]  Their wealth is on the order of J.D.
[03:48:44.220 --> 03:48:44.740]  Rockefeller.
[03:48:46.392 --> 03:48:49.995]  The power over the population is much higher.
[03:48:49.995 --> 03:48:57.260]  And it took a rebel president named Teddy Roosevelt, who was sort of an independent, he had a bull moose party.
[03:48:57.260 --> 03:49:01.424]  It took a rebel president to finally bust up the trusts.
[03:49:01.424 --> 03:49:06.227]  And I think Donald Trump has some of Teddy Roosevelt's qualities in him.
[03:49:06.227 --> 03:49:13.553]  And more to the point, if Donald Trump doesn't bust up these monopolies, they will bust him up.
[03:49:13.553 --> 03:49:14.774]  That's the timing here.
[03:49:15.529 --> 03:49:19.614]  You know, Infowars and Alex Jones has been doing it for almost 20 years.
[03:49:19.614 --> 03:49:25.000]  But to do this right now, all the companies at once, three months before the midterms elections?
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:26.762]  Don't tell me that's a coincidence.
[03:49:26.762 --> 03:49:29.565]  And this is political.
[03:49:29.565 --> 03:49:34.331]  If Donald Trump doesn't stop it, they will make the Democrats win.
[03:49:36.357 --> 03:49:39.879]  Now, I just want to zoom out, Ezra, and look at it from this perspective.
[03:49:39.879 --> 03:49:44.462]  Since the election, since November 2016, Milo has been viciously smeared.
[03:49:44.462 --> 03:49:48.244]  You know, Alex Jones has been hit by, well, nearly a dozen lawsuits at this point.
[03:49:48.244 --> 03:49:49.945]  He's now deleted off the internet.
[03:49:49.945 --> 03:49:51.426]  Tommy has been imprisoned.
[03:49:51.426 --> 03:49:54.268]  You know, people connected to the Trump campaign have been imprisoned.
[03:49:54.268 --> 03:49:55.809]  Lauren Southern, banned from the UK.
[03:49:55.809 --> 03:49:58.470]  Breitbart lost most of its advertisers.
[03:49:58.470 --> 03:50:00.992]  Trump supporters up and down the country being physically attacked.
[03:50:01.727 --> 03:50:03.349]  This is punishment, isn't it, Ezra?
[03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:08.095]  This is punishment for Hillary Clinton losing the election.
[03:50:08.095 --> 03:50:08.816]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:50:08.816 --> 03:50:11.559]  I mean, the concept of a deep state.
[03:50:11.559 --> 03:50:16.826]  The irony here is so many of Alex Jones's speculations and fears that were mocked.
[03:50:17.665 --> 03:50:19.046]  Well, haven't they come true?
[03:50:19.046 --> 03:50:26.372]  What we've learned about the CIA and the other intelligence agencies and the FBI setting up Donald Trump with a fake dossier.
[03:50:26.372 --> 03:50:32.617]  I mean, that's the stuff that if Alex Jones would have mused about it two years ago, people would have said, oh, you're crazy.
[03:50:32.617 --> 03:50:34.638]  You know, that and your aliens talk.
[03:50:34.638 --> 03:50:36.199]  Well, my God, it's come true.
[03:50:36.199 --> 03:50:39.482]  And if Alex Jones would have said, I predict
[03:50:39.995 --> 03:50:52.245]  That all of the social media companies will, within a 12-hour course of time, all independently, by coincidence, decide to ban and delete everything I've done.
[03:50:52.245 --> 03:50:54.387]  Damnatio memoriae.
[03:50:54.387 --> 03:50:56.869]  People say, stop with the conspiracy theories.
[03:50:56.869 --> 03:50:58.471]  Well, what do you call it when it happens?
[03:50:59.219 --> 03:51:01.161]  It just happened.
[03:51:01.161 --> 03:51:03.102]  But the thing is, how do people know?
[03:51:03.102 --> 03:51:10.567]  One day they go to a YouTube site, and the next time it's not there, and they just sort of say, huh, oh, I guess something happened, and they move on.
[03:51:10.567 --> 03:51:15.931]  Only people whose volume knobs are turned way up, like you and me and those following closely, will even know it.
[03:51:15.931 --> 03:51:23.177]  That's the problem with being unpersoned, is that most people say, oh, yeah, you know, there used to be some place I would get some information.
[03:51:23.177 --> 03:51:24.818]  I wonder what happened to that guy.
[03:51:24.818 --> 03:51:26.319]  Oh, well, I'll just turn on the Young Turks.
[03:51:27.307 --> 03:51:28.168]  And that's the thing.
[03:51:28.168 --> 03:51:33.751]  The Young Turks, in my mind, was sort of a counterbalance to Alex Jones and Infowars.
[03:51:33.751 --> 03:51:39.795]  They were edgy, they were profane, they were on the left, as Alex Jones and Infowars are on the right.
[03:51:39.795 --> 03:51:44.598]  But the president of YouTube would pose for glamour shots with the Young Turks.
[03:51:44.598 --> 03:51:50.022]  They would get massive injections of venture capital funds.
[03:51:50.022 --> 03:51:51.723]  They were the toast of the town.
[03:51:51.723 --> 03:51:54.425]  They were not demonetized, as the right was.
[03:51:54.425 --> 03:51:55.005]  So it's not
[03:51:55.914 --> 03:51:59.475]  A legitimate policy violation.
[03:51:59.475 --> 03:52:04.537]  I'm not saying that in every single video Alex Jones has ever done, he hasn't violated a policy here and there.
[03:52:04.537 --> 03:52:11.279]  But this complete erasing and depersoning, if that were meted out equally, well we know it's not.
[03:52:11.279 --> 03:52:14.760]  And look at CNN and the New York Times egging on Twitter.
[03:52:14.760 --> 03:52:19.361]  They're saying Twitter is the last company that hasn't blackballed Infowars.
[03:52:19.361 --> 03:52:19.981]  Will they do it?
[03:52:19.981 --> 03:52:22.462]  The New York Times is literally having an online poll.
[03:52:23.157 --> 03:52:24.639]  Now it's going horribly wrong.
[03:52:24.639 --> 03:52:27.843]  People are answering the freedom answer.
[03:52:27.843 --> 03:52:31.267]  CNN lobbying.
[03:52:31.267 --> 03:52:35.051]  And Paul, it's not just their business rivals they're trying to shut up.
[03:52:35.051 --> 03:52:37.094]  It's their idea rivals.
[03:52:37.094 --> 03:52:41.419]  Because Infowars, and obviously none of us agrees with everything on the channel.
[03:52:41.419 --> 03:52:42.420]  I mean, I don't watch a lot of it.
[03:52:43.823 --> 03:52:46.264]  But it's a dissident voice.
[03:52:46.264 --> 03:52:48.365]  And for God's sakes, allow a dissident voice.
[03:52:48.365 --> 03:52:51.607]  Even if you don't like a dissident voice, allow a dissident voice.
[03:52:51.607 --> 03:52:57.810]  CNN, the New York Times, the media party, they are an ideas cartel.
[03:52:57.810 --> 03:52:59.651]  And they don't like a dissident voice.
[03:52:59.651 --> 03:53:05.914]  And if Alex Jones in Infowars is as crazy as they say he is, well then what are they afraid of?
[03:53:05.914 --> 03:53:07.695]  Why don't they allow a dissident voice?
[03:53:09.540 --> 03:53:09.940]  Exactly.
[03:53:09.940 --> 03:53:19.323]  And there's a huge jealousy aspect to this as well, which is based around the fact that to have a successful presence on a platform like YouTube, you have to have a personality.
[03:53:19.323 --> 03:53:20.403]  You have to be engaging.
[03:53:20.403 --> 03:53:24.445]  You have to build up that loyalty and that trust with your audience so they keep coming back.
[03:53:24.445 --> 03:53:28.526]  The mainstream media, the hacks who work for them, don't have personalities.
[03:53:28.746 --> 03:53:30.967]  Nobody cares what Brian Stelter has to say.
[03:53:30.967 --> 03:53:33.628]  Certainly young people don't care what he has to say.
[03:53:33.628 --> 03:53:36.110]  My demographic is 18 to 35.
[03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:38.951]  CNN's at this point is what, over 70.
[03:53:38.951 --> 03:53:45.294]  This is what drives their jealousy and their bitter hatred as to why they want to silence their competition.
[03:53:45.294 --> 03:53:52.778]  It's also about removing your opportunity to have a platform to defend yourself against their constant smears.
[03:53:52.778 --> 03:53:54.979]  It's very sinister in the way it works.
[03:53:55.379 --> 03:54:01.582]  I just want you to quickly talk about, you sent me this legal memo earlier on the email, Packingham versus North Carolina.
[03:54:01.582 --> 03:54:06.765]  This is a Supreme Court case that determined cyberspace and social media to be a public square.
[03:54:06.765 --> 03:54:07.506]  Is that correct?
[03:54:07.506 --> 03:54:09.187]  Expand on that for me.
[03:54:09.187 --> 03:54:09.967]  That's right.
[03:54:09.967 --> 03:54:12.949]  There's, you know, I'm not an expert in U.S.
[03:54:12.949 --> 03:54:19.152]  constitutional law, but there was a case just in the last year or so where the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously
[03:54:20.053 --> 03:54:21.555]  Uh, it was a unanimous ruling.
[03:54:21.555 --> 03:54:26.098]  There's a lot of rulings in there about how the social media is the town square of the day.
[03:54:26.098 --> 03:54:28.440]  Now, I won't get into the facts of that case.
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:35.707]  It was someone who was being banned by a state law from having a social media account, but all the judges said, no, you can't do that.
[03:54:35.707 --> 03:54:39.690]  Uh, and, and quoting judge after judge on the right and the left.
[03:54:40.385 --> 03:54:47.067]  The entire spectrum of the Supreme Court said social media is the modern town square.
[03:54:47.067 --> 03:54:52.748]  One of the judges, I think it was Alito, said some people live their lives there.
[03:54:52.748 --> 03:55:02.891]  So for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, a handful of San Francisco executives to say, no, you're banned, you're depersoned, that may well be a violation of the First Amendment.
[03:55:02.891 --> 03:55:04.271]  Don't take it from me.
[03:55:04.271 --> 03:55:08.393]  Take it from all nine judges on the Supreme Court of the United States.
[03:55:08.393 --> 03:55:10.033]  I think Alex Jones and Infowars
[03:55:10.658 --> 03:55:11.778]  Should sue.
[03:55:11.778 --> 03:55:31.722]  Because this is tantamount to a telephone company calling you up one day and saying, hey Paul, we've been listening to your phone calls on our cell phone company, and we don't like what you're saying, we're going to ban you from using the phone, and all the other phone companies are banning you from using the phone, and we're deleting your phone number, and if you don't like it, just invent your own phone company.
[03:55:31.722 --> 03:55:39.464]  That's what it's like when these neutral platforms decide to be editors and censors, then they're subject to the First Amendment.
[03:55:39.464 --> 03:55:40.204]  And I think that
[03:55:40.954 --> 03:55:43.737]  Alex Jones and Infowars should not go quietly.
[03:55:43.737 --> 03:55:45.119]  Not that they ever would.
[03:55:45.119 --> 03:55:55.290]  But I think they should sue and they should find true supporters of free speech, including if there is some version of the ACLU that hasn't gone silent as a church mouse.
[03:55:56.588 --> 03:55:56.948]  Exactly.
[03:55:56.948 --> 03:55:58.549]  I mean, where is the line in the sand?
[03:55:58.549 --> 03:56:01.811]  People are already banned on Patreon from making money for their content.
[03:56:01.811 --> 03:56:02.651]  You know, what's next?
[03:56:02.651 --> 03:56:04.493]  Are they going to ban bank accounts?
[03:56:04.493 --> 03:56:07.814]  Are they going to ban the ability for people to get mortgages and have houses?
[03:56:07.814 --> 03:56:10.236]  I mean, where is the line in the sand here?
[03:56:10.236 --> 03:56:17.680]  Just in the final minute though, tell people about where they can find you on Twitter and Rebel Media and, you know, do we need some kind of executive action on this?
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:19.541]  Is that the only solution remaining to us?
[03:56:20.569 --> 03:56:23.331]  I think if Donald Trump doesn't do it, it's not going to get done.
[03:56:23.331 --> 03:56:24.111]  Thanks for the invitation.
[03:56:24.111 --> 03:56:27.793]  If folks want to follow me, I'm at twitter.com slash Ezra Levant.
[03:56:27.793 --> 03:56:28.614]  That's just my name.
[03:56:28.614 --> 03:56:32.036]  And if folks, I'm doing my whole show on this tonight at 8 p.m.
[03:56:32.036 --> 03:56:33.036]  Eastern Time.
[03:56:33.036 --> 03:56:37.159]  If folks want to watch that, that's at therebel.media.
[03:56:37.159 --> 03:56:40.761]  And I tell you, in five seconds, I'll tell you, don't joke about banks.
[03:56:40.761 --> 03:56:43.042]  We could not find a single bank in the United Kingdom.
[03:56:43.442 --> 03:56:47.628]  That would let us open up an account when Tommy Robinson worked for us.
[03:56:47.628 --> 03:56:53.656]  They are already banning us in financial institutions in the United Kingdom.
[03:56:53.656 --> 03:56:54.738]  Absolutely sinister.
[03:56:54.738 --> 03:56:55.639]  Alright, we'll leave it there.
[03:56:55.639 --> 03:56:57.341]  Ezra, TheRebel.media.
[03:56:57.341 --> 03:56:58.282]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:56:58.282 --> 03:56:59.664]  Appreciate it.
[03:56:59.664 --> 03:57:00.025]  Thanks, Paul.
[03:57:01.351 --> 03:57:05.094]  All right, there goes Ezra Levant again in the final 40 seconds here.
[03:57:05.094 --> 03:57:08.457]  I want to encourage you to get the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:08.457 --> 03:57:09.718]  They haven't banned them yet.
[03:57:09.718 --> 03:57:13.200]  Maybe they'll find some way to prevent us buying the products to sell to you.
[03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:14.862]  Maybe that'll be the next stage.
[03:57:14.862 --> 03:57:18.264]  Please get the InfoWars app before it's banned.
[03:57:18.264 --> 03:57:23.969]  If you can download the app before it's banned, then at least it's safe on your phone and you can actually use it.
[03:57:24.489 --> 03:57:29.434]  at the Google Play Store or on Apple, as long as it remains uncensored.
[03:57:29.434 --> 03:57:34.038]  It may not be there for long, so please, right now, get the InfoWars app.
[03:57:34.038 --> 03:57:35.579]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:35.579 --> 03:57:39.342]  Owen Troyer's coming up with War Room, Breaking News, InfoWars.com.
[03:57:39.342 --> 03:57:39.783]  Don't go away.
[03:57:47.077 --> 03:57:52.821]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.821 --> 03:58:00.686]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.686 --> 03:58:03.848]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.028 --> 03:58:09.291]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:58:09.291 --> 03:58:12.073]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:58:12.073 --> 03:58:21.038]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:58:21.118 --> 03:58:25.960]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:58:51.497 --> 03:58:55.279]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:58:55.279 --> 03:59:03.984]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:59:03.984 --> 03:59:08.587]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:59:08.587 --> 03:59:10.028]  You are the info war.
[03:59:10.028 --> 03:59:13.550]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:59:14.230 --> 03:59:25.618]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:59:25.618 --> 03:59:33.603]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:59:33.603 --> 03:59:40.648]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:59:40.648 --> 03:59:43.390]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[03:59:46.661 --> 03:59:49.269]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
