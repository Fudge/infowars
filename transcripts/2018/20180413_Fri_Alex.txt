[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.222]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:31.027]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:32.468]  Here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:48.423]  Friday, hard to believe the 13th day of April 2018, and we're going to be riding, riding, riding, riding, right through the next four hours, then another three hours with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone in the war room.
[00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:52.426]  That'll be it for this emergency 34-hour transmission.
[00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:56.009]  Stop World War with Russia!
[00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.212]  And there have been some major signs that Trump is backing away from the
[00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:10.845]  Tweets about Assad being a murderer with gas and being an animal and that our smart missiles were coming.
[00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:12.846]  Really didn't like that on Wednesday.
[00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:14.988]  Pat Buchanan didn't like it either.
[00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:18.970]  First thing Trump's really done that made Pat Buchanan want to throw up.
[00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.053]  Well, yesterday Trump tweeted, I never said I'm going to strike Syria.
[00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:25.955]  Never said if I would, never said if I wouldn't.
[00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.836]  Okay, I like everything else Trump's doing.
[00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:28.757]  I know he's under attack.
[00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:30.458]  I know I'm under massive attack for supporting him.
[00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:41.697]  I understand the globalists are really upset because he's mainly taking power away from them and transferring it back to the nation-state, out of the TPP, out of the UN.
[00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:45.899]  But that said, there's other big signs that things are still cooking.
[00:01:45.899 --> 00:02:00.867]  And if the neocons and globalists have already been caught staging three chemical attacks, and now this fourth one appears to be staged, and they sure try to get us to rush into war hours after it happened, and they've been beating that drum that we're all Russian agents and we don't want World War III,
[00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.863]  How dare Russia go defeat ISIS?
[00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:10.066]  But still, in the air, a nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:12.748]  E-4B Night Watch allows the U.S.
[00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:18.351]  to maintain chain of command in the event of a major conflict, and the airplanes are airborne right now.
[00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:20.833]  There's nine of them.
[00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:25.696]  And they are normally following the President around, but on the ground, except when they're following the President.
[00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:35.272]  But once the DEFCON goes up closer to thermal nuclear war, they stay in the air, at least part of them.
[00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:38.194]  They can stay in the air for 150 hours, that's what's admitted.
[00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:43.298]  They're electromagnetically shielded, so that they can take a nuke going off just a few miles away.
[00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:51.145]  That is a high-tech piece of equipment and undoubtedly one of the most expensive aircraft in the world.
[00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:59.626]  And I saw some foolish comments on InfoWars going, how are you going to run command and control with only 50 people on board?
[00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.108]  It's the people in command back to folks on the ground.
[00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:05.852]  It doesn't mean the whole command and control is in the air.
[00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:15.101]  It's like a couple of AWACS can direct the whole attack of hundreds of jet aircraft, sorties, fighter bombers, you name it.
[00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.543]  But the fact that it's in the air,
[00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:23.731]  That most of the nine planes are in the air, that's classified, but reportedly most of them are in the air, they're being seen.
[00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:27.593]  Confirmed that some are in the air.
[00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:30.975]  Shows you that this is a serious situation.
[00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:33.017]  Correction, I said nine planes, there's ten planes.
[00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.439]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down.
[00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.861]  Obviously Trump has come out and called Comey a slime bulb.
[00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:52.029]  And the media's like, how dare you call our gracious Lord, our unelected bureaucracy, the Vice President of the Deep State, Comey.
[00:03:52.029 --> 00:04:00.296]  The President was McCain, but his brain tumor's so bad, the President of the Deep State's now Robert Mueller, the Lord and Savior of the left, and their unelected government.
[00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:08.420]  How dare you when he went on national TV, ABC, Comey, and said, I don't know if women urinate on the president.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.041]  Might be true.
[00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:15.606]  Well, how do we know Comey isn't getting in the sir lines at night and eating big old piles of crap?
[00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:17.188]  I mean, I don't know if it's true.
[00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:20.771]  Maybe Comey's a child molester.
[00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.912]  Maybe Comey snorts.
[00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:25.553]  Methamphetamine off hooker's rear ends.
[00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:32.600]  I mean, none of that's probably true, but you sit there and say it, but you're saying it about the president, you dirtbag, on television.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.025]  When that whole PPGate thing was what was paid for by you and your buddies at the Justice Department, illegally sending money.
[00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:46.088]  To the head of the Justice Department's operations wife at the Fusion GPS, you people have no shame.
[00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:48.748]  And the deep state's fighting for its life.
[00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:50.889]  We're winning, but we're in the thick of battle.
[00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.270]  So cry have it, let loose the dogs of the info war, and let them have it.
[00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.011]  That means press the attack.
[00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:58.571]  Don't think about who's winning, attack!
[00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:32.322]  Gregory Brower reads, all FBI employees must maintain a top-secret security clearance.
[00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:51.793]  On a Fox News appearance, Senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected can still access information regarding the investigation, posing a potential threat to national security.
[00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:55.935]  Paul said Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump
[00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:57.636]  And they need to be fired.
[00:05:57.636 --> 00:06:09.981]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.661]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.202]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:12.202 --> 00:06:12.782]  Or you're mine.
[00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:54.392]  You are tuned into, either on radio or broadcast television, cable television, or internet streams, or by podcast later, to the most hated multimedia news transmission in the world.
[00:06:54.392 --> 00:07:00.494]  Most hated, most infamous, most dreaded,
[00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:20.705]  By globalists, by tyrants, by authoritarians, by child molesters, by devil worshippers, by control freaks, by scumbags, by fascists, by criminals.
[00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:23.468]  Take Comedy Central and its stupid no ratings show.
[00:07:25.814 --> 00:07:28.836]  That they admit is completely based on me.
[00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:31.879]  And the sets and everything trying to rip off our office.
[00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:37.223]  So they can then misrepresent who we are with fake satire.
[00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:41.967]  And then they come up and confront me on the street with total hatred and disdain.
[00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:47.151]  Shaking in their petty wannabe elitist behavior.
[00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.112]  Think about that.
[00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:51.014]  You steal somebody's identity.
[00:07:51.014 --> 00:07:53.096]  You got a fake news show.
[00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:54.237]  Hiding behind comedy.
[00:07:56.718 --> 00:08:07.362]  And then four nights a week, you have a program misrepresenting your prey.
[00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.343]  That's what they do.
[00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:25.369]  And then they make the joke, oh, Alex Jones is a crisis actor, and then say, how dare you say no children died at Sandy Hook and at Aurora and at
[00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:49.131]  Parkland and then I explained in the raw video that it's on Infowars.com where I actually stand on that and that I had debates about it on both sides because we've seen media stage events before and that I do believe people died at Sandy Hook but that PR bandwagons jumped on it and took control of it
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.601]  And didn't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:08:52.601 --> 00:09:11.588]  But even when I told Megyn Kelly that last year, even when I said that on air three years ago, or put out a quote, final message two years ago, the media will never pick up what I actually say because they think it's a weakness point with me because they believe I changed my stance on it, which I never really did.
[00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:15.609]  But see, that shows how they know I tell the truth.
[00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:17.510]  And so their whole world is about
[00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:24.141]  Distorting that truth.
[00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:27.643]  That's their program.
[00:09:27.643 --> 00:09:32.726]  And they're not important enough to sit here and even talk about.
[00:09:32.726 --> 00:09:47.235]  But it's another indicator on our digital readout of life here of just how upset Viacom that brought us the nightmare of MTV and the cultural pollution of gangster rap
[00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:53.353]  And all the force-fed garbage.
[00:09:53.353 --> 00:10:15.242]  This is a Sumner Redstone hate letter to America with a bunch of elitist and talentless mercenaries attempting to demonize the American opposition to being colonized by global corporations.
[00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:15.382]  So,
[00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:39.948]  It's a badge of honor that these scumbags attacked me, but when I finally watched a segment of the show, I've only seen little clips before, because I just, it's just, they act so conceited, like a bunch of frat boys, a bunch of arrested development people, that I just can't watch it.
[00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:44.751]  The left fopping around, acting smart, acting snarky,
[00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:55.166]  And then heavily editing all of it to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done.
[00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:57.827]  And I'm not stupid.
[00:10:57.827 --> 00:11:10.772]  I can see the media building their crescendo to have families of the Sandy Hook victims suing.
[00:11:10.772 --> 00:11:12.773]  And that's what this production is.
[00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:16.094]  These productions of the, quote, comedy shows are directed by the Democratic Party.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.901]  Colbert admits it.
[00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:21.381]  Jimmy Kimmel admits it.
[00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:21.862]  Look it up.
[00:11:21.862 --> 00:11:25.463]  They had daily conversations with Chuckie Schumer, with Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:25.463 --> 00:11:29.445]  They help direct what it's about.
[00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:40.650]  And so they want to put the false idea out to the public that Alex Jones attacks children and that you can't ever question any big public event.
[00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:58.457]  And it's all part of the PR rollout to brand opposition to world government and tyranny and globalism as evil so that other people are intimidated from being involved in the movement to restore the country's sovereignty, its prosperity, and its freedom.
[00:11:58.457 --> 00:12:00.818]  Hollywood and the globalists are a cancer.
[00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.382]  At the heart of this nation and other nations.
[00:12:05.382 --> 00:12:07.242]  Openly at war with the family.
[00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:09.483]  Openly at war with success.
[00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:11.623]  Openly at war with independence.
[00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:19.946]  Openly at war with any form of freedom.
[00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:27.347]  Like every other authoritarian that has come down the road in history.
[00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.128]  Like every other authoritarian system.
[00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:32.158]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:44.970]  It's just incredible to see them do edits every two seconds and then to stage part of what happened by watching the video.
[00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.852]  I could tell that.
[00:12:46.852 --> 00:12:49.294]  To see that they shot parts of it when it actually wasn't even there.
[00:12:49.294 --> 00:12:53.699]  They would just turn the camera on the street and have the guy talk as if he made those statements to me.
[00:12:56.069 --> 00:13:06.998]  Because I was saying Chuck E. Cheese the rat over and over again, knowing the power of memes, so that we can dub that particular reporter, I forget his name, Chuck E. Cheese the rat.
[00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:08.860]  Because he's like an animatronic rat.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.323]  He said, don't try to give me brain force like I'm a gerbil.
[00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:21.150]  And I said, you don't look like a gerbil, you look like Chuck E. Cheese the rat, animatronic rat, plus you're a puppet, it's a perfect archetype.
[00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.312]  But when you see the shaking hate
[00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:32.322]  That the host of the show has, and his minions have, it's because the funding for all of these shows has been cut 60-70%.
[00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:33.143]  There are massive layoffs.
[00:13:37.162 --> 00:13:51.191]  Throughout mainstream media, throughout Hollywood, throughout all the corporate press, the stuff that Bezos is propping up at the Washington Post is about to implode, I can tell you that very soon, inside baseball.
[00:13:51.191 --> 00:14:01.058]  The New York Times has been bankrupt for a long, long time, propped up by Carlos Slim, the Middle Eastern-Mexican kingpin.
[00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:07.021]  And so these folks are at war with the country.
[00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:10.944]  They want to dominate us like all other strongmen do.
[00:14:10.944 --> 00:14:21.032]  And they find effeminate, metrosexual culture to be the best poison to kill manhood, the family, and chivalry.
[00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:25.015]  So remember how they talk behind the scenes about bitter clingers and flyover country.
[00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:27.337]  Now Hillary publicly says she hates the Midwest.
[00:14:28.894 --> 00:14:34.077]  And she hates her constituents and hates how they're baristas and want all this free stuff and she can't supply it.
[00:14:34.077 --> 00:14:40.021]  They are the ruling corrupt class that launched wars and Arab Springs and all of it.
[00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:51.349]  And the camp follower left all went and got two or three worthless degrees at these colleges and there aren't jobs, there isn't industry, there's not even media jobs.
[00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.071]  And so only the most aggressive, hate-filled,
[00:14:55.552 --> 00:15:11.366]  Sycophantic, gremlin-like servants of the globalist agenda are hired, and they scrabble and claw like Stelter and the rest of them, and you see the manifestation of the bottom of the barrel.
[00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:13.347]  Of just repulsive looking.
[00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:21.819]  I don't mean even how they look, but their mannerisms, the look in their eyes, the things they say they do.
[00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:30.166]  These are horrible, fallen, twisted, truly deranged individuals who cannot stand your strength.
[00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:32.985]  They cannot stand your honor.
[00:15:32.985 --> 00:15:34.726]  They cannot stand your will.
[00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:45.816]  And they want to break you so bad because then if they can break America, and if they can target Christians, and if they can make all the young people depressed under their control, they can rule over the pile of garbage they create.
[00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.859]  But only by pulling down the world can they rule.
[00:15:48.859 --> 00:15:50.160]  That is their spirit.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.003]  When we come back, nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:54.404]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:02.095]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[00:16:38.007 --> 00:16:41.151]  Your home and even shut down your business.

[00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:00.952]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:17.793]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:22.437]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.657 --> 00:18:29.441]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:36.625]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:43.649]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:48.112]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:52.355]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.

[00:19:06.897 --> 00:19:07.357]  Great!
[00:19:07.357 --> 00:19:08.458]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:13.002]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:19:13.002 --> 00:19:14.683]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:19:14.683 --> 00:19:22.109]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:22.870]  Wow, thank you.
[00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.492]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:27.053]  Which super-surgical did you like best?
[00:19:27.293 --> 00:19:30.534]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:19:30.534 --> 00:19:30.914]  That's amazing.
[00:19:30.914 --> 00:19:32.054]  That's really incredible.
[00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:35.095]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:36.455]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:38.116]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:19:38.116 --> 00:19:39.376]  And I love the guys.
[00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:41.537]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:48.378]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:19:48.378 --> 00:19:49.418]  You will love it.
[00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:51.239]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:55.983]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:55.983 --> 00:20:03.450]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.053]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.243 --> 00:20:15.885]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:22.731]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:39.165]  Coming up, we're going to look at the accelerated collapse of Viacom, the accelerated collapse of Time Warner, the accelerated collapse of all of these major media companies except for Disney, and of course, that's merging with News Corp.
[00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:46.430]  The NFL's lost about 45% of its viewers the last three years, and guess who picked them up?
[00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:55.815]  The NBA had the highest ratings ever because they didn't allow continued urination on the veterans and the American flag.
[00:20:55.815 --> 00:21:00.018]  Oh, you've got your free speech, NFL players, little spoiled rotten punks.
[00:21:00.018 --> 00:21:05.161]  We have ours to not watch your stinking, stupid, right-head behavior.
[00:21:05.161 --> 00:21:06.862]  Let me just continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:07.864 --> 00:21:12.427]  Coming up next segment, former CIA director tears into Trump.
[00:21:12.427 --> 00:21:14.869]  Your kakistocracy, am I saying that right?
[00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:19.953]  I guess that means a system of unqualified criminals, is collapsing.
[00:21:19.953 --> 00:21:24.916]  No, you are the globalists that are trying to collapse America.
[00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:34.403]  And never when they have Brennan or these other criminals quoted, they go, oh Brennan's the guy that illegally surveilled President Trump and then got caught lying about it.
[00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:37.345]  Brennan's the guy that was involved in all this criminal activity.
[00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:48.059]  Brennan is so delusional he couldn't believe when Trump fired him and said, you'll regret this, and watch your mouth!
[00:21:48.059 --> 00:22:02.903]  The bureaucracy, it's like you're 35 years old, 40 years old, and you get home and your 16-year-old son or daughter's at a party, when you left for a couple days to go fishing, and your 16-year-old says, it's my house now, Pop, and I'm gonna kick your butt!
[00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:07.563]  If you try to tell me I can't have my friends over to raid the liquor cabinet.
[00:22:07.563 --> 00:22:09.964]  Well, let's go outside, Junior.
[00:22:09.964 --> 00:22:13.545]  And that's exactly what Brennan's like.
[00:22:13.545 --> 00:22:18.307]  An old Wahhabist on the payroll of the last regime in Saudi Arabia.
[00:22:18.307 --> 00:22:19.468]  And Trump's rolling all that up.
[00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:21.009]  You know, I said that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:22:21.009 --> 00:22:26.611]  Let me get to that next segment since I've mentioned it.
[00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.373]  And then I'm going to get more, again, into the collapse of the media.
[00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:31.934]  What you're seeing is mainstream media trying to pull
[00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:45.784]  New independent media, the free open internet, conservatism, nationalism, populism, common sense, free market behavior, really just survival instinct.
[00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:52.466]  They're trying to pull survival instinct into the mentally ill grave with them.
[00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:56.527]  You get around leftists, they all grew up in massive cities and tiny apartments.
[00:22:56.527 --> 00:22:57.907]  Most of them didn't have daddies at home.
[00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:13.668]  Even if they're really an alpha in their behavior and their genetics, they have a beta complex where they want to dominate everybody and they're all very neurotic, very hateful, very, very alone, very sociopathic, very psychopathic.
[00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.391]  And the statistics show that.
[00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:24.057]  The left, again, six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely to not give to charity.
[00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:29.081]  In the entire world, same studies, look them up yourself, type in, the left is more stingy, commits more crimes.
[00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:33.105]  That's in major liberal universities, and they go, we don't know why.
[00:23:33.105 --> 00:23:35.787]  Because you're trash, that's why.
[00:23:35.787 --> 00:23:38.089]  You're scum.
[00:23:38.089 --> 00:23:44.094]  You hate everybody, so you pose as a nice person so you can manipulate people that have morals under your control.
[00:23:46.121 --> 00:23:50.585]  So you can misrepresent who we are and try to guilt us all day.
[00:23:50.585 --> 00:23:56.589]  Well it's time to stop letting them define how to talk and what to do and what a family is and what words to use.
[00:23:56.589 --> 00:24:00.472]  In Europe they arrest people now that criticize Islam.
[00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.794]  They arrest people that say there's only two genders.
[00:24:02.794 --> 00:24:05.796]  These people mean business!
[00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:08.859]  They're easy to defeat if people just wake up and take action.
[00:24:12.227 --> 00:24:18.191]  Now I'm going to come back with Comey and all the rest of it and Trump calling him a slimeball in the next segment.
[00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:29.098]  But right now we are 20, what, 28 hours into the worldwide emergency stop world war with Russia transmission.
[00:24:33.786 --> 00:24:38.969]  And if you're watching or listening on the radio, however you're tuned in, it is beyond imperative.
[00:24:38.969 --> 00:24:46.054]  It is absolutely essential that you spread the live links, the articles, the videos, if you want to crush the globalists.
[00:24:46.054 --> 00:24:52.478]  They fear this transmission because we have the enemy blueprint and we have the blueprint of prosperity to challenge it with.
[00:24:52.478 --> 00:24:59.443]  And all over the world, every election is going against the globalists, except for the few they're stealing here in the U.S.
[00:24:59.443 --> 00:25:02.285]  So we're facing their full counterattack, like Battle of the Bulls here.
[00:25:03.609 --> 00:25:05.189]  They're the Nazis, we're the Allies.
[00:25:05.189 --> 00:25:07.830]  They're led by a Nazi collaborator.
[00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.512]  And the whole corrupt arm of the Vatican that helped Hitler.
[00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:17.413]  And the EU's run by the grandson of the head of the Nazi war machine.
[00:25:17.413 --> 00:25:27.917]  And the reason I mention that is they're always calling us Nazis because they are the money and the inclination and the will of what was left of the Nazis.
[00:25:27.917 --> 00:25:30.197]  And the whole Rockefeller-Nazi project.
[00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:31.998]  Adolf Hitler was a product
[00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:44.081]  Of IBM and a product of the Rockefeller Foundation on record.
[00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:49.124]  IBM and the Rockefellers commanded Hitler.
[00:25:49.124 --> 00:25:50.064]  And they set him up.
[00:25:50.064 --> 00:25:50.945]  Hitler was a bad guy.
[00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:51.725]  They set him up.
[00:25:51.725 --> 00:25:54.527]  He had a treaty with the King of England.
[00:25:54.527 --> 00:25:55.387]  England was going to stand down.
[00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.288]  That's why he didn't take out the British troops at Dunkirk.
[00:25:57.288 --> 00:25:58.549]  They were just supposed to evacuate and leave.
[00:26:00.936 --> 00:26:04.477]  You cannot make up the... You understand, these are realities.
[00:26:04.477 --> 00:26:17.000]  And I have Comedy Central people and all these folks and Media Matters people funded by Soros and Right Wing Watch, their main funder is Soros, and they're in my face, and I go, your main funder is Soros, an admitted Nazi collaborator.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:27.182]  The EU is run by the hereditary heir to the Nazi fortune, who still owns countries himself, Luxembourg.
[00:26:27.182 --> 00:26:27.622]  Like, you know,
[00:26:28.638 --> 00:26:34.079]  Granddaddy took it over with Hitler, so you get it, and then you're the head of the unelected EU, a Nazi project.
[00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:36.499]  This is reality!
[00:26:36.499 --> 00:26:51.842]  They just laugh at me, and they've always got like little fake intellectual little hairstyles, and they're into acting wimpy, and it's like, dude, you understand you're only hired because you act like a weak beta who'll be a traitor.
[00:26:51.842 --> 00:26:54.603]  The globalists want little sycophantic lapdogs.
[00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:58.729]  Always look at the bodyguards Zuckerberg and others have.
[00:26:58.729 --> 00:27:02.110]  They're never real soldiers or experts.
[00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:07.431]  They're always like other little weird wimps like them because they hate fighting men.
[00:27:07.431 --> 00:27:08.851]  They hate fighting women.
[00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:12.412]  The globalists hate strength because they are weakness.
[00:27:12.412 --> 00:27:14.612]  Now I'm going to go to break, come back with the Russian news.
[00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:17.253]  Then I promise I'm going to plow through the clubs and get into Comey and all the rest of it.
[00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:20.473]  It's a jam-packed transmission.
[00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:24.274]  As you know, they are trying to shut us down.
[00:27:25.502 --> 00:27:33.989]  And they are so frustrated that they can't because of you standing with us in your prayers and the fact that you get past the censors by telling people word of mouth about the show.
[00:27:33.989 --> 00:27:38.753]  Infowars.com, Ford's last show, the free podcast, all of it, local stations listening to it.
[00:27:38.753 --> 00:27:41.815]  The other side of the equation is money.
[00:27:41.815 --> 00:27:42.836]  I want to expand.
[00:27:42.836 --> 00:27:45.959]  They know I'm building new studios, satellite uplinks, getting them more stations.
[00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:48.841]  They're scared.
[00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.503]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:27:56.564 --> 00:28:04.039]  And we have stopped the new world war with Russia specials, limited time specials, survival shield x2.
[00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:07.544]  is going up in price.
[00:28:07.544 --> 00:28:09.765]  And we may not be able to source it after the next two runs.
[00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:10.965]  It's about to be sold out.
[00:28:10.965 --> 00:28:13.986]  I still have 25% off the amazing Good Halogen.
[00:28:13.986 --> 00:28:15.106]  All the others are bad for the body.
[00:28:15.106 --> 00:28:16.067]  It's the Good Halogen.
[00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:18.907]  If your body doesn't have the Pure Iodine, it'll die without it.
[00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:22.929]  It will try to run off fluoride, chlorine, bromide, and things like that.
[00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:26.049]  Survival Shield X2, incredible experience for yourself.
[00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:29.970]  Also get an Alexa Pure Pro free with a three-month food supply purchase.

[00:28:55.183 --> 00:28:56.843]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:28:56.843 --> 00:28:57.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:06.146]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:10.407]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[00:29:10.407 --> 00:29:15.029]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:31.477]  You have been lied to.
[00:29:31.477 --> 00:29:33.198]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[00:29:33.198 --> 00:29:35.920]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.244]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.244 --> 00:29:46.928]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.928 --> 00:29:50.351]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[00:31:22.365 --> 00:31:23.505]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:27.247]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.247 --> 00:31:29.949]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.949 --> 00:31:35.752]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.752 --> 00:31:38.714]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.714 --> 00:31:42.236]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:44.477]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.477 --> 00:31:44.837]  I love it.
[00:31:44.997 --> 00:31:47.798]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.798 --> 00:31:48.798]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:06.061]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:33.122]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:33.122 --> 00:33:41.269]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:51.036]  Well, people always said, why didn't somebody put up a resistance against the globalists, foreign corporations, taking over nation states, using their taxes, their resources, their people.
[00:33:51.926 --> 00:33:55.367]  Their will to dominate other nations.
[00:33:55.367 --> 00:34:02.469]  America has been under globalist exploitation for more than 60 years, building a private corporate empire for ruthless individuals.
[00:34:02.469 --> 00:34:19.975]  They've taken over our industry, they've taken over our religious institutions, they've taken over the banks, they've taken over the higher education, and they have produced an anti-human, eugenics-based, post-industrial technocracy that is authoritarian in
[00:34:21.229 --> 00:34:26.993]  The Davos Group and the EU's own words.
[00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:45.564]  But they hope that they can confuse you and lie to you on CNN and MSNBC, and then if you're the 20% that actually cares about even mainstream news, or if you're the 80% that get your news from comedy shows, well, they sit there and condescend and edit and prey on you.
[00:34:45.564 --> 00:34:47.666]  They know you're a mark.
[00:34:47.666 --> 00:34:49.467]  They know they're targeting you.
[00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:54.139]  They revel in their hatred for you and your family.
[00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.822]  When I say that, folks, you've heard the recordings, you've seen the spirit.
[00:34:57.822 --> 00:35:03.347]  To be bad and to do this kind of stuff to people, you have to get into it.
[00:35:03.347 --> 00:35:04.628]  They're into it.
[00:35:04.628 --> 00:35:10.633]  They're like, why would a serial killer grab little kids out of the backs of their backyards and take them into dungeons and torture them and rape them for months?
[00:35:12.469 --> 00:35:18.293]  Because a little child begging for mommy and screaming is called beautiful music to a psychopath, to a satanist.
[00:35:18.293 --> 00:35:28.401]  Raping them, torturing them, gouging their eyeballs out as they pray for mommy, and mommy never coming, that makes them feel good.
[00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:40.590]  And so to a lesser extent, you've got the cowardly psychopaths in establishment media that can't get away with stuff like that, but if they can push gender confusion,
[00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:46.833]  And teach your five-year-old boy that he could chop his genitals off and screw him up.
[00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:51.075]  That's a big vampiric win.
[00:35:51.075 --> 00:36:02.660]  If they can make you take on a whole new language of total mental illness, like a tower to Babel where no one can even communicate, and where mother and father, male and female, are a crime, they win!
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.501]  It's called depopulation.
[00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:07.863]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into the news right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:13.811]  Nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne!
[00:36:13.811 --> 00:36:18.174]  As war fears grow, E-4B Nightwatch allows U.S.
[00:36:18.174 --> 00:36:20.936]  to maintain chain of command in the event of a major conflict.
[00:36:20.936 --> 00:36:25.560]  Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:32.704]  Then it breaks it all down, that these are only airborne when the DEFCON moves up towards the chance of a nuclear war.
[00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:38.889]  And of course, if you strike Russian forces preemptively, they can then strike you, and then it goes tit for tot.
[00:36:40.612 --> 00:36:51.740]  And you're into a major war, perhaps even a nuclear war, and all the top analysts of Russia's studies in the US, in Europe, in Russia.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.500]  We've had many of them on.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.123]  In fact, we've had Princeton University professor on before.
[00:36:56.123 --> 00:36:57.103]  I've had other professors on.
[00:36:58.184 --> 00:37:09.456]  As well, Professor Emeritus of Russian Studies at Princeton University and New York University, Stephen Cohen, told Tucker Carlson last night he is more worried than he's ever been at the prospect of nuclear war with Russia.
[00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:10.738]  Here, let's just hear from him.
[00:37:11.988 --> 00:37:20.916]  I'm more worried than I've ever been for nearly 50 years of studying and participating in US-Russian relations.
[00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:28.323]  I think the situation, your generation was born after the Cuban Missile Crisis, but you were taught in school, as were my children,
[00:37:28.823 --> 00:37:36.348]  That the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was the moment when we came closest ever to nuclear war with Russia.
[00:37:36.348 --> 00:37:41.992]  And the learned lesson was supposed to be we should never get there again, and we are very close.
[00:37:41.992 --> 00:37:43.794]  And here's why.
[00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:48.357]  If Trump or somebody sends these missiles against Syria,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:56.542]  There are Russian soldiers embedded in almost all Syrian army units, even in dormitories.
[00:37:56.542 --> 00:38:10.186]  If, and this I know because Moscow has said so, if Russians die, if Damascus is attacked, the capital of Syria, Russia will retaliate with its excellent weapons, every bit as good as ours.
[00:38:10.186 --> 00:38:14.047]  Some people say in some regards, in missile technology, better.
[00:38:14.047 --> 00:38:14.887]  Russia will strike,
[00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:29.635]  Americans in Syria will die and we will be where we have never ever ever been with Russia killing each other bearing in mind that both nations are laden with nuclear weapons.
[00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:35.018]  So I am more worried than I have ever been in my life at least since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:38:35.898 --> 00:38:45.806]  But that's okay because the mainstream media only wants parents to stand down and let the school teach your children about their sexuality and try to get them to change their sex.
[00:38:45.806 --> 00:39:01.958]  I remember 30 years ago, or longer now, in high school, hardly the old I am now, you had to sign a form but your parents didn't let you go to health class because they'd show you, you know, footage of gonorrhea and stuff like that.
[00:39:03.757 --> 00:39:13.060]  In health class, but I remember thinking, oh yeah, you know, I wasn't really a leftist, but I thought, oh, these goody two-shoe right-wingers, why are they afraid of the school being involved in sex education?
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.660]  This makes sense for us to know these things.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.301]  You know, my dad was a physician, so I already have been taught a lot of things.
[00:39:17.301 --> 00:39:28.345]  I thought it was normal to have info, but I didn't realize in other schools around the country at that very time, they were already in New York and other areas teaching seven-year-olds how to perform anal sex and do things I can't even say.
[00:39:29.005 --> 00:39:30.545]  And using it as a way to corrupt them.
[00:39:30.545 --> 00:39:35.727]  And now, hell, they're telling five-year-olds, you're not a boy, you're not a girl, you'll be something else, you're a little girl.
[00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:43.089]  And these liberal women want to abuse their sons, as Camille Pagli has said, as a sacrament of attacking manhood, to raise little soy boys.
[00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:44.409]  That's what they give them.
[00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:46.390]  No meat, no nothing, just soy.
[00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.350]  It's a religion.
[00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.391]  The man's never there.
[00:39:50.391 --> 00:39:55.752]  And, again, they're passing bathroom bills, where anybody can go to any bathroom they want.
[00:39:57.062 --> 00:40:04.427]  And Cuomo, you know, says, well, if your daughter doesn't like seeing a man's genitals in the shower at school, she's a bigot.
[00:40:04.427 --> 00:40:10.291]  Imagine, they want full-grown adult men to go in the showers with your ten-year-olds, and you're a bigot.
[00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:15.735]  See, once it's you're a bigot, give us your rights, give us your speech, give us your children, give it, give it, give it.
[00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:17.396]  They know what they're doing.
[00:40:17.396 --> 00:40:20.178]  They're asking for the stars.
[00:40:20.178 --> 00:40:22.479]  They're asking for a trillion miles.
[00:40:22.479 --> 00:40:23.700]  They don't care if they only get $500 billion.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:35.144]  But here's the deal, they're getting what they want because these schools and facilities are cults and everyone wants to one-up the next person.
[00:40:35.144 --> 00:40:38.645]  Can you imagine?
[00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:53.071]  They said if your daughter doesn't want to see a full-grown man, the example was a news article about they're going to have transgendered men that are women in public schools showering with your daughters.
[00:40:54.076 --> 00:40:56.138]  They said, you know, the coach or whatever.
[00:40:56.138 --> 00:40:58.159]  And Cuomo said, big deal.
[00:40:58.159 --> 00:41:01.021]  That's a good thing.
[00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:05.545]  So we've got all this potential nuclear war, all the rest of it going on, but none of that matters.
[00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:11.530]  Joy Behar says Kim Jong-un and Putin have more sanity than Trump.
[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.071]  So now they can't even get their story straight.
[00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:15.213]  They love a total dictator that's killed millions of people.
[00:41:17.062 --> 00:41:17.202]  Yeah.
[00:41:17.202 --> 00:41:17.342]  Yeah.
[00:41:47.708 --> 00:41:50.329]  He's saying, come talk to us, stop threatening us.
[00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:53.410]  It's the threatening thing that's bad.
[00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.751]  But see, they want him to shut up.
[00:41:54.751 --> 00:41:56.411]  Oh, when Trump has a platform, it's bad.
[00:41:56.411 --> 00:41:58.172]  Though Bayhar's got her ABC show.
[00:41:58.172 --> 00:41:59.653]  See how there's all agendas here.
[00:41:59.653 --> 00:41:59.893]  Here it is.
[00:42:02.513 --> 00:42:09.875]  What makes me nervous is that I don't know that this president is able to compartmentalize things in the way that a president should.
[00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:20.858]  So when he has all this Stormy Daniels stuff and his personal attorney's law firm and home being raided by the FBI, I just wonder if that is agitating him so much.
[00:42:20.858 --> 00:42:23.398]  Does he then lean towards making emotional decisions?
[00:42:23.398 --> 00:42:27.259]  Bill Clinton was famous for being able to compartmentalize things.
[00:42:27.259 --> 00:42:28.940]  Monica Lewinsky, Syria.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.721]  It wasn't Syria, you moron.
[00:42:31.721 --> 00:42:36.523]  It was Iraq.
[00:42:36.523 --> 00:42:40.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, who do you think's putting the pressure on the president?
[00:42:40.045 --> 00:42:42.486]  It's these people.
[00:42:42.486 --> 00:42:46.609]  And those harpies perched up there, betting on America to fail because they're globalists.
[00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:49.490]  They're the elites that perch on you.
[00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.170]  They know it.
[00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.071]  They talk about it.
[00:42:51.071 --> 00:42:52.071]  They enjoy it.
[00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:56.154]  They hate you because they're traitorous sacks of garbage.
[00:42:56.154 --> 00:42:58.335]  Never forget, they are your enemy.
[00:42:59.212 --> 00:43:06.678]  Did President Trump nearly fire special counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of some fake news?
[00:43:06.678 --> 00:43:15.505]  According to a New York Times article published this week, Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his bank records.
[00:43:15.505 --> 00:43:20.529]  The Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Mueller probe.
[00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:28.375]  The stories about the bank subpoenas, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg, turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction.
[00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:31.918]  Noting the subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates.
[00:43:31.918 --> 00:43:37.763]  This week the President tweeted, And this isn't the first time that the New York Times has reported that the President considered firing Mueller.
[00:43:37.763 --> 00:43:41.846]  The Times reported that the President demanded White House Counsel Don McGahn fire Mueller in June 2017.
[00:43:54.096 --> 00:43:57.037]  But Trump backed down after McGahn threatened to resign.
[00:43:57.037 --> 00:43:59.298]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:59.298 --> 00:44:04.901]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have an InfoWars life.
[00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:05.761]  It'd take hours.
[00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:08.202]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.202 --> 00:44:09.383]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.383 --> 00:44:11.003]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:12.204]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold.
[00:44:13.244 --> 00:44:15.325]  The Candida, it's back in stock.
[00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:18.506]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.506 --> 00:44:22.287]  It's got the Preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.287 --> 00:44:25.388]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[00:44:25.388 --> 00:44:26.128]  So you can upload it.
[00:44:26.128 --> 00:44:35.431]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:37.672]  That's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[00:44:37.672 --> 00:44:40.673]  It's a supplement with iodine, super
[00:44:41.033 --> 00:44:43.014]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:44.395]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[00:45:59.835 --> 00:46:06.142]  Infowars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[00:46:06.142 --> 00:46:14.551]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:19.257]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:46:19.617 --> 00:46:23.358]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[00:46:23.358 --> 00:46:26.178]  Well now it's 50% off.
[00:46:26.178 --> 00:46:34.600]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.420]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.921]  But the two go together.
[00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:39.941]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[00:46:39.941 --> 00:46:49.103]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:49.423 --> 00:46:54.629]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out!
[00:46:54.629 --> 00:47:02.939]  InfoHorseLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[00:47:02.939 --> 00:47:05.562]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:11.345 --> 00:47:15.769]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:28.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.519 --> 00:47:30.300]  Cackistocracy!
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:37.045]  Your cackistocracy is collapsing, says ex-CI director as he tears into Trump.
[00:47:37.045 --> 00:47:38.707]  This is a bureaucratic position.
[00:47:40.097 --> 00:47:49.239]  Put in there by Obama, who was caught illegally spying on the candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, and then President Trump.
[00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:54.701]  Right up until the time Trump fired him under the orders of Obama.
[00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:59.362]  And John O. Brennan thinks he's God.
[00:48:01.138 --> 00:48:09.682]  Former CIA Director John Brennan, the guy that is a Wahhabist, the guy that's been caught lying to Congress, just like Clapper's in the news saying Trump's bad.
[00:48:09.682 --> 00:48:14.184]  Why do we have Clapper on the news?
[00:48:14.184 --> 00:48:18.586]  Clapper got caught lying to Congress saying the NSA's never spied on one American.
[00:48:18.586 --> 00:48:19.847]  And the moon's also made of cheese.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.961]  And there's not only two genders, there's five million.
[00:48:23.961 --> 00:48:38.325]  Former CIA Director John Brennan on Friday went after President Trump over his attacks on former FBI Director James Comey, tweeting that Trump's taxistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.
[00:48:38.325 --> 00:48:41.426]  Now let's compare reality here.
[00:48:41.426 --> 00:48:44.126]  Four plus trillion in the stock market, extra.
[00:48:44.126 --> 00:48:46.047]  They've only knocked off a trillion, so three trillion.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.361]  Two million new jobs.
[00:48:48.361 --> 00:48:50.822]  Lowest unemployment rate ever.
[00:48:50.822 --> 00:48:52.684]  Highest small business startup.
[00:48:52.684 --> 00:48:54.885]  The most new companies coming back into the country.
[00:48:54.885 --> 00:48:57.827]  Trump fighting back against the lopsided trade deficit.
[00:48:57.827 --> 00:48:59.268]  Killing TPP.
[00:48:59.268 --> 00:49:00.409]  Some say he's flip-flopping.
[00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:04.251]  No, he said, I'm taking us out of it and killing it all because it's an unfair agreement.
[00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:06.532]  We can renegotiate it later.
[00:49:06.532 --> 00:49:09.114]  And we'll do it unilaterally, nation to nation.
[00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:10.795]  It won't be secret.
[00:49:10.795 --> 00:49:11.876]  That's what he always said.
[00:49:12.927 --> 00:49:13.867]  They said he flip-flopped.
[00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:16.108]  That's one way they attack him is through the right wing.
[00:49:16.108 --> 00:49:18.609]  People want to score fake points.
[00:49:18.609 --> 00:49:20.270]  When Trump does something wrong, I'll get into it.
[00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.731]  But I am in the guts of this.
[00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:24.572]  I am in the facts of this.
[00:49:24.572 --> 00:49:25.532]  I'll get into that next hour, though.
[00:49:25.532 --> 00:49:26.413]  That's a whole other issue.
[00:49:26.413 --> 00:49:27.353]  Let me get back to this.
[00:49:27.353 --> 00:49:31.274]  It's just like DACA, or it's just like the guns.
[00:49:31.274 --> 00:49:34.836]  He'll say, oh yeah, tell me what you want, whatever you want.
[00:49:34.836 --> 00:49:37.737]  Not saying it's going to pass, but tell me what you want.
[00:49:37.737 --> 00:49:39.578]  Feinstein rubs her hands together like a rat.
[00:49:40.981 --> 00:49:46.423]  He meets the Wicked Witch of the East and says, well, we want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:49:46.423 --> 00:49:52.646]  And he goes, OK, well, thank you for showing your hand, baby.
[00:49:52.646 --> 00:49:53.706]  He did it on DACA.
[00:49:53.706 --> 00:49:55.207]  They got nothing.
[00:49:55.207 --> 00:49:59.909]  He said during the campaign, he said, yeah, there might be a million people been here for decades, no criminal record.
[00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:02.150]  Let's accelerate them getting their citizenship.
[00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.012]  But if you have been here over and over again, you've been deported, you have a criminal record, you're gone.
[00:50:06.012 --> 00:50:06.472]  What a joke.
[00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:11.147]  The media said, he hates Mexicans and says they're all scum!
[00:50:11.147 --> 00:50:12.829]  There's no video of it.
[00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:14.230]  He didn't say it.
[00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:21.397]  Just like I didn't say there's Martian slave bases.
[00:50:21.397 --> 00:50:24.921]  Very, very, very, very fake news.
[00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:27.863]  This is what they do.
[00:50:27.863 --> 00:50:31.427]  But they say it enough to where you're supposed to believe it.
[00:50:35.595 --> 00:50:36.315]  So it's amazing.
[00:50:36.315 --> 00:50:39.177]  Now I want to get to Comey's incredible behavior on ABC.
[00:50:39.177 --> 00:50:40.738]  They analyzed this.
[00:50:40.738 --> 00:50:58.147]  Comey talks about briefing Trump on the Steele dossier, the Fusion GPS, where the head of the Russia operation of the Justice Department, Strzok, that was the FBI, the head of the Justice Department operation, gave his wife the contract.
[00:50:58.147 --> 00:51:01.089]  She only went to work at Fusion GPS for the Russia
[00:51:02.045 --> 00:51:03.386]  Gate dossier.
[00:51:03.386 --> 00:51:04.247]  It's a pure fiction.
[00:51:04.247 --> 00:51:06.470]  It's admitted to not be true.
[00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.894]  They don't care.
[00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:15.319]  He just gets up and says, well, I don't know if people peed on him.
[00:51:15.319 --> 00:51:25.449]  You also don't know if he flies around on Christmas Eve with Santa Claus and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Dasher and Blitzen and Comet and all the rest of them.
[00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:30.925]  I mean, you can't say that Trump doesn't fly around on Christmas Eve with Santa Claus.
[00:51:30.925 --> 00:51:34.887]  You can't say that he doesn't secretly have a little forked tail either.
[00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:37.827]  You can't say that Trump isn't drinking baby blood at night.
[00:51:37.827 --> 00:51:46.130]  But we all know that's really the globalist and leftist and all their Aleister Crowley crap that they publicly admit they do.
[00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.931]  So there you go.
[00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:52.112]  We know it's the Clintons and Epstein and the Lolita Express and the kidnapped kids.
[00:51:54.107 --> 00:51:55.128]  But none of that matters.
[00:51:55.128 --> 00:51:58.032]  It doesn't matter what's in the WikiLeaks, it's who got them!
[00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:04.541]  And the whole story becomes that and the media parrots that until even those of us that are awake finally focus on what they're saying.
[00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:09.328]  They still have the power to bully us and to beat a dead horse to death until just by rhythmic motion.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:21.602]  Oh, they get us into a trance of yes, and then we debate that we're not Russians, instead of, what are you talking about?
[00:52:21.602 --> 00:52:24.143]  You're the ones in the WikiLeaks committing the crimes, let's remember that.
[00:52:24.143 --> 00:52:31.005]  So I think every day we should start publishing articles about, remember this WikiLeak, remember that WikiLeak.
[00:52:31.005 --> 00:52:40.167]  Maybe we should write a new article about, it's about what's in the WikiLeaks, stupid, and put that out, and hopefully Drudge would link to it, and relist the 100 top WikiLeaks.
[00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:42.708]  Remember the, we'll have the kids for entertainment in the hot tub?
[00:52:44.718 --> 00:52:53.580]  We'll have the Aleister Crowley preparation with blood and semen ready, sir.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.301]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:56.301 --> 00:53:02.022]  But let's go ahead and go to hair combing.
[00:53:02.022 --> 00:53:06.043]  And just listen to this, trying to push a book, and then Trump says you're a slimeball.
[00:53:06.043 --> 00:53:08.184]  The article's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:53:09.204 --> 00:53:12.607]  And then he's like, oh my God, I've been shooting the FBI!
[00:53:12.607 --> 00:53:13.708]  How dare you!
[00:53:13.708 --> 00:53:17.212]  It's President Mueller and Vice President Comey!
[00:53:17.212 --> 00:53:24.259]  They're not elected, but they're the most important, pure, driven, snow, good boys.
[00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:25.340]  You ever seen American Psycho?
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.461]  It's very accurate how he looks.
[00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:27.122]  Super handsome.
[00:53:28.407 --> 00:53:33.128]  Christian Bale, nice suit, very authoritative, tells the women what to do.
[00:53:33.128 --> 00:53:36.729]  That's just how silver-tongued, real psychopaths, high-level operatives are.
[00:53:36.729 --> 00:53:40.370]  Because see, the low-level psychopaths, the ones you hear about, they get caught.
[00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:44.130]  The smart ones, it's admitted, get into the power structure.
[00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.211]  And so they got their little psycho outfits on, their little perfect suits.
[00:53:47.211 --> 00:53:48.171]  We're good boys!
[00:53:48.171 --> 00:53:49.792]  We're wearing nice suits!
[00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:54.053]  Well, we now need to call him Dear Leader Mueller.
[00:53:54.053 --> 00:53:55.593]  Dear Vice Leader Comey.
[00:53:57.739 --> 00:53:59.161]  Let's go to Lord Comey, here it is.
[00:54:15.622 --> 00:54:22.404]  Allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the Russians taped it and have leverage over him.
[00:54:22.404 --> 00:54:25.624]  Was there any choice there?
[00:54:25.624 --> 00:54:28.445]  Why, if this was salacious... Let's hit pause.
[00:54:28.445 --> 00:54:32.206]  You've got Stephanopoulos, the former chief of staff of the Clintons.
[00:54:32.206 --> 00:54:35.247]  Just like when you see Brennan or you've seen these people.
[00:54:35.247 --> 00:54:39.568]  Used to, if Fox was covering News Corp news, they'd say that's our parent company.
[00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:44.529]  Or used to, people would point out, by the way, I should say this, I'm a Clinton operative, Stephanopoulos, but they don't.
[00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:48.046]  It's the former Chief of Staff for the Clintons.
[00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:51.186]  Comey goes way back in the FBI with Mueller covering up for them.
[00:54:51.186 --> 00:54:53.607]  It's all one little ringleader group here.
[00:54:53.607 --> 00:54:57.628]  And they're just talking about prostitutes peeing on people when the whole thing's admitted to be fake.
[00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.929]  And you look at Comey's body language.
[00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:08.931]  This is a studied con man trying to not give off any facial expressions when he is lying his butt off.
[00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:09.451]  Let's continue.
[00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:16.735]  If this was salacious, and this particular part of the dossier unverified, still unverified by the way?
[00:55:16.735 --> 00:55:17.936]  Yes.
[00:55:17.936 --> 00:55:19.977]  So far as, when I got fired it was unverified.
[00:55:19.977 --> 00:55:22.319]  Did you tell him that the Steele dossier... But stop right there!
[00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.560]  They think the audience is dumb.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.021]  It's been admitted to be totally fake.
[00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:27.502]  But they know you don't have a long memory.
[00:55:27.502 --> 00:55:29.043]  They hope you don't, like Gruber said.
[00:55:29.043 --> 00:55:31.025]  We're here about getting our memories up to snuff.
[00:55:31.025 --> 00:55:32.786]  You can develop your memory, as everybody knows.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.261]  Unless you forgot that.
[00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:37.862]  They're all betting you don't remember, so they play this game.
[00:55:37.862 --> 00:55:42.524]  They gotta add that as a proviso, but do it real slick, like, well, still, I don't remember since I got off.
[00:55:42.524 --> 00:55:43.425]  Well, we don't know, then.
[00:55:43.425 --> 00:55:44.786]  Oh, God, maybe it's true.
[00:55:44.786 --> 00:55:49.828]  Maybe the prostitutes, you know, projectile diarrhea all over him, too.
[00:55:49.828 --> 00:55:52.229]  Maybe Trump drank gallons of diarrhea.
[00:55:52.229 --> 00:55:56.091]  Maybe, you know, maybe he jumped out of a window and turned into a bat and flew to Pluto.
[00:55:56.091 --> 00:56:01.554]  Let's continue with the former head of the Clinton operation, Stephanopoulos, posing as an ABC news person.
[00:56:01.554 --> 00:56:02.955]  Let's hear from the political hack.
[00:56:02.955 --> 00:56:03.355]  Let's hear it.
[00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:05.720]  No.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.122]  I didn't think I used the term steal dossier.
[00:56:08.122 --> 00:56:10.443]  I just talked about additional material.
[00:56:10.443 --> 00:56:11.724]  But did he have a right to know that?
[00:56:11.724 --> 00:56:15.246]  That it had been financed by his political opponents?
[00:56:15.246 --> 00:56:17.087]  I don't know the answer to that.
[00:56:17.087 --> 00:56:23.211]  It wasn't necessary for my goal, which was to alert him that we had this information.
[00:56:23.211 --> 00:56:24.632]  What a good friend!
[00:56:24.632 --> 00:56:25.612]  We're alerting you!
[00:56:25.612 --> 00:56:31.576]  He's the admitted guy that lied to Congress about leaking, and then said, well I didn't leak, I gave it to a professor.
[00:56:32.904 --> 00:56:34.447]  At a university Lincoln.
[00:56:34.447 --> 00:56:36.110]  That's like a mafia Don.
[00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:38.915]  I didn't kill Bobby the Bull.
[00:56:38.915 --> 00:56:46.067]  I had Rocco, one of my captains, tell some of the soldiers that I had a problem.
[00:56:47.179 --> 00:56:49.540]  They didn't take care of the problem!
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.682]  They were gonna be sleeping in the canal!
[00:56:52.682 --> 00:56:54.482]  But I didn't hurt nobody!
[00:56:54.482 --> 00:56:55.763]  Let's go back to Coleman.
[00:56:55.763 --> 00:56:57.084]  Here he is.
[00:56:57.084 --> 00:56:58.785]  How graphic did you get?
[00:56:58.785 --> 00:57:00.345]  I think as graphic as I needed to be.
[00:57:00.345 --> 00:57:10.070]  I started to tell him about the allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during a visit for the Miss Universe pageant.
[00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:14.272]  And that the Russians had filmed the episode.
[00:57:14.272 --> 00:57:15.793]  And he interrupted very defensively.
[00:57:16.773 --> 00:57:21.838]  And started talking about it, you know, do I look like a guy who needs... Hit pause!
[00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:27.683]  Defensively, you got the FBI director telling you there's footage of you with hookers, it's total bull.
[00:57:27.683 --> 00:57:30.226]  Trump's a neat freak, it's well known.
[00:57:30.226 --> 00:57:31.387]  Just a load of crap.
[00:57:31.387 --> 00:57:34.730]  We're gonna finish up with this straight ahead when we come back and so much more.
[00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:35.591]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:35.991 --> 00:57:37.452]  This is the resistance.
[00:57:37.452 --> 00:57:38.753]  We are victory.
[00:57:38.753 --> 00:57:43.896]  Standing together against the globalists and Soros and the Hollywood filth, we will prevail.
[00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:45.457]  They will all go bankrupt.
[00:57:45.457 --> 00:57:46.657]  They will go to hell.
[00:57:46.657 --> 00:57:47.598]  We will move forward.

[00:59:33.917 --> 00:59:35.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:20.510]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:23.151]  Well, it's even in mainstream news headlines!
[01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:23.532]  Comey!
[01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:28.283]  Got caught trying to blackmail Trump early on.
[01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:37.047]  Trying to get the deep state back in there and try to claim with this made-up Russiagate dossier, Threat Fusion GPS.
[01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:41.029]  The Steele dossier, as it's alternately known.
[01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:43.830]  Comey got caught trying to blackmail the President.
[01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.610]  That's what this is all about.
[01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.552]  He was leaking the whole time he got caught lying to Congress.
[01:00:47.552 --> 01:00:48.912]  What a criminal!
[01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:51.674]  He helped cover up for the Clintons and their crime rings.
[01:00:51.674 --> 01:00:53.835]  So the Hive got it half right with their headline.
[01:00:55.649 --> 01:00:59.311]  Trump thinks Comey was trying to blackmail him.
[01:00:59.311 --> 01:01:03.613]  Oh no, nobody tries to blackmail the president when you're the deep state.
[01:01:03.613 --> 01:01:10.037]  No, and Chuckie Schumer never said the deep state has seven ways from Sunday to get back at a president.
[01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:12.518]  Oh no, there's no deep state at all.
[01:01:12.518 --> 01:01:13.338]  No, no, no.
[01:01:13.338 --> 01:01:23.504]  There's no permanent bureaucracy that's completely arrogant and sycophantic trying to start World War III with Russia and pushing Trump into it while they got all this money from Russia.
[01:01:24.571 --> 01:01:28.154]  And got our uranium while they're openly on the payroll of the Communist Chinese.
[01:01:28.154 --> 01:01:29.755]  It's incredible.
[01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:37.401]  But here's Stephanopoulos in the interview with Comey for his upcoming fiction novel.
[01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:40.964]  Wolf now admits his book's basically fiction, but that's later for lawsuits, they add that.
[01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:45.408]  Oh, by the way, since the sales aren't good anymore, it's fake.
[01:01:45.408 --> 01:01:48.750]  The known charlatan of New York, even by the liberals, Wolf.
[01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:49.671]  But don't make fun of him.
[01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:51.052]  He's Jewish.
[01:01:51.052 --> 01:01:52.934]  The young Turks will call you anti-Semitic.
[01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:58.063]  What does that even mean?
[01:01:58.063 --> 01:01:59.468]  Again, that's the craziest.
[01:01:59.468 --> 01:02:00.231]  Well, I guess Comey's...
[01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:03.817]  Comey's just a white guy, isn't he?
[01:02:03.817 --> 01:02:05.178]  Am I bashing white guys now?
[01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:06.600]  I don't even know what Comey's background is.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.562]  Like, you called Brian Stelter Jewish, but he's not.
[01:02:09.562 --> 01:02:11.764]  I didn't say Brian Stelter was Jewish!
[01:02:11.764 --> 01:02:13.105]  I never even thought that!
[01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:17.328]  But again, that's their whole deception on their viewers to change the subject from.
[01:02:17.328 --> 01:02:26.776]  Comey is putting out a fake dossier, got caught doing it, it's criminal what they did, and they're back recycling it again on ABC News with the former head of
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.302]  The Clinton White House, Stephanopoulos.
[01:02:30.302 --> 01:02:32.305]  There should be an advisory on him.
[01:02:32.305 --> 01:02:38.454]  You know how they want an advisory of something state-funded like NPR or PBS?
[01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.858]  I kind of like that, but I don't want the government in that business doing that.
[01:02:43.746 --> 01:02:44.467]  They're doing it with the Russians?
[01:02:44.467 --> 01:02:53.377]  Well how about this person's a former political operative, this person works for the Clintons, this person was involved reportedly in the crimes and the covering up with Comey and Mueller.
[01:02:53.377 --> 01:03:01.205]  You got two old pals, two old gangsters hanging out, making something up about the Prez, because he thinks he's the Prez and not them.
[01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.550]  Here it is.
[01:03:19.481 --> 01:03:20.302]  Alright, let's stop right there!
[01:03:48.556 --> 01:03:59.930]  Oh it's really weird, I'm a Clinton operative with a whole Clinton nest that made up the dossier and paid our wives and families for it, and McCabe got a half million from Hillary, and Stephanopoulos gave $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation, blah blah blah.
[01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:01.031]  They don't tell you any of that!
[01:04:01.892 --> 01:04:04.833]  They tell you that Trump is a catnistocracy.
[01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:09.736]  That's what the CIA former director is saying when he's up to his eyeballs in the illegal spying on Trump.
[01:04:09.736 --> 01:04:15.358]  It's a system of government which is run by the worst, least qualified or most unscrupulous citizens.
[01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:18.840]  They have just defined their whole criminal operation.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.741]  It's Trump that hadn't hired any lobbyists.
[01:04:20.741 --> 01:04:22.782]  It's Trump that's got incredible standards.
[01:04:22.782 --> 01:04:24.863]  It's Trump bringing the country back.
[01:04:24.863 --> 01:04:25.103]  Oh, but...
[01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:32.774]  Brennan says the country is in a total shambles, and is in a disaster, and a lamentable journey, and the country's collapsing.
[01:04:32.774 --> 01:04:36.319]  It's the opposite, you vampire piece of trash!
[01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:38.703]  You arrogant, crazy man!
[01:04:38.703 --> 01:04:40.205]  You narcissistic twit!
[01:04:41.198 --> 01:04:44.079]  You foppish enemy of everything that's good!
[01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:45.560]  You are a failure!
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.101]  You are out of power!
[01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:48.522]  You are trash!
[01:04:48.522 --> 01:04:49.742]  Everyone hates you!
[01:04:49.742 --> 01:04:51.523]  You'll never shut us down!
[01:04:51.523 --> 01:04:52.404]  Never!
[01:04:52.404 --> 01:04:54.825]  Never, never, never, Filth!
[01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:55.105]  Never!
[01:04:55.105 --> 01:04:56.546]  You'll never break our wills!
[01:04:56.546 --> 01:04:57.106]  You'll never do it!
[01:04:58.373 --> 01:05:03.957]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:05:03.957 --> 01:05:04.838]  It'd take hours.
[01:05:04.838 --> 01:05:07.280]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.461]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:10.062]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:13.285]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:14.406]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.406 --> 01:05:17.588]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.588 --> 01:05:20.911]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.411 --> 01:05:21.671]  I think so.
[01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.331]  I don't know.
[01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:17.373]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:19.074]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:19.074 --> 01:06:20.735]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:20.735 --> 01:06:25.638]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.638 --> 01:06:26.939]  It is truly bizarre.
[01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:28.941]  It is truly surreal.
[01:06:38.533 --> 01:07:04.156]  To watch James Comey and to know how he covered up the Clinton Foundation crimes, covered up her criminal servers, open and shut perjury to Congress, open and shut perjury to the FBI, open, absconding with evidence, racketeering, organized criminal behavior, illegal contributions by the billions, a money laundering operation, that's what the foundation is with four billion, mind-blowing!
[01:07:04.156 --> 01:07:04.797]  And then Comey,
[01:07:07.017 --> 01:07:16.726]  And Strock and all of them inside the FBI set up a special project for an insurance policy.
[01:07:16.726 --> 01:07:17.226]  Remember that?
[01:07:17.226 --> 01:07:19.008]  Oh, we forgot about that.
[01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:26.014]  And pay millions of dollars to Threat Fusion GPS.
[01:07:26.014 --> 01:07:27.876]  Threat Fusion GPS.
[01:07:29.107 --> 01:07:33.190]  The Steele dossier, the PP dossier, and the whole thing's admitted fake.
[01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:47.582]  If you just joined us, I played the clip from ABC News with Stephanopoulos, the Clinton operative, just sitting there in your face lying to you with Comey, and then Comey finishes up right here with getting into Trump's character.
[01:07:47.582 --> 01:07:50.364]  So Comey is like Moses on the mountain.
[01:07:50.364 --> 01:07:52.126]  Comey is the arbiter.
[01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:53.627]  He's the gauge.
[01:07:53.627 --> 01:07:54.368]  He's not even human.
[01:07:54.368 --> 01:07:55.689]  He's like an angelic figure.
[01:07:56.792 --> 01:08:01.656]  The Oracle, the purest soul the Earth has ever seen.
[01:08:01.656 --> 01:08:06.860]  Mueller with uranium on tarmacs of the Russians and being on all these Russian boards and getting money.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.981]  It's all good.
[01:08:07.981 --> 01:08:10.623]  Missile secrets to China, it's no problem.
[01:08:10.623 --> 01:08:13.986]  No, no, it's Comey.
[01:08:13.986 --> 01:08:18.650]  And Trump calls him a lying slimeball, the biggest leaker, the biggest liar.
[01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:21.192]  And he was caught!
[01:08:21.192 --> 01:08:23.134]  See, I don't just believe Trump.
[01:08:23.134 --> 01:08:24.555]  My head's in the game.
[01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:30.293]  We're in sudden death overtime for the country and the whole world.
[01:08:30.293 --> 01:08:34.215]  The globalists are pushing us towards a thermal nuclear war.
[01:08:34.215 --> 01:08:36.496]  Top analyst degree I played at last hour.
[01:08:36.496 --> 01:08:38.717]  Top Princeton professor on Russian studies.
[01:08:38.717 --> 01:08:47.320]  And there's only, what, me, Drudge, Pat Buchanan.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.420]  Folks like Tucker Carlson.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.521]  Tucker Carlson's really good.
[01:08:53.203 --> 01:08:57.266]  That are saying, there's no evidence the Russians did this.
[01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.566]  There's no evidence Assad did it.
[01:08:58.566 --> 01:08:59.887]  The rebels have been caught three times.
[01:08:59.887 --> 01:09:00.728]  They have the motive.
[01:09:00.728 --> 01:09:02.149]  The Russians are pulling out.
[01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:07.652]  Why would we blow up Russians in 70 sites, hit them with probably thousands of cruise missiles?
[01:09:07.652 --> 01:09:12.516]  They hit one target with 59 last year.
[01:09:12.516 --> 01:09:18.800]  Why'd they have seven missile cruisers, four US, three British, with thousands of missiles on board?
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.180]  Thousands.
[01:09:22.934 --> 01:09:23.915]  I eat shit and carry over 100.
[01:09:23.915 --> 01:09:28.157]  I guess it's 700, 800, 900, whatever.
[01:09:28.157 --> 01:09:32.360]  About to launch this attack and kill a bunch of Russians.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.782]  When the Russians are pulling out?
[01:09:35.782 --> 01:09:38.063]  The Russians went in to take out ISIS.
[01:09:38.063 --> 01:09:40.004]  They're pulling out.
[01:09:40.004 --> 01:09:42.906]  Further agreement with the Pentagon five years ago.
[01:09:42.906 --> 01:09:47.769]  And the globalists want to double-cross that and take a big fat you-know-what in the punchbowl.
[01:09:48.885 --> 01:10:02.374]  And there's Hillary and her foundation in the deep state and the globalists climbing up at the party to a big punchbowl and pulling their pants down and hanging their big wart-covered butt over the edge.
[01:10:02.374 --> 01:10:06.536]  And Trump started tweeting out, crapping the punchbowl, start World War III.
[01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:12.360]  And finally, sanity came back in, the public woke up, and the neocons backed off, along with the Democrats.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.902]  But this is mind-blowing!
[01:10:15.902 --> 01:10:18.384]  I'm sad to use gross analogies, but I gotta get your attention.
[01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.692]  Okay.
[01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:27.336]  Guys, type in hydrogen bombs, Pentagon footage, Air Force footage, hydrogen bombs.
[01:10:28.629 --> 01:10:37.154]  Let's put something behind me just for the rest of the day here, for people to think, because I love little snarky comments online and the Twitter leftists, everybody, oh Alex, World War III again?
[01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:38.715]  Oh, is it going to kill us?
[01:10:38.715 --> 01:10:39.716]  Oh, how bad is it?
[01:10:39.716 --> 01:10:41.336]  Oh my God, you film on there.
[01:10:41.336 --> 01:10:42.657]  Assad is a horrible person.
[01:10:42.657 --> 01:10:43.958]  The White Helmets are good.
[01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:47.340]  I watch their show on Netflix, okay?
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.482]  We can't show you the footage of White Helmets raping women and children.
[01:10:50.482 --> 01:10:52.883]  It's online, cutting their heads off.
[01:10:52.883 --> 01:10:57.086]  I was sent by the Pentagon and by Dr. Corsi stuff
[01:10:59.639 --> 01:11:01.520]  That we call the FBI about.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.083]  I'm not even sure I could be sent this stuff a few years ago and there was no reply from the FBI.
[01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:08.866]  Just like when we get sent the most horrible, vile child porn I call the FBI.
[01:11:08.866 --> 01:11:10.948]  They called them again this week.
[01:11:10.948 --> 01:11:14.891]  Because we had the RSVP to go speak at the National Press Club and somebody was sending child porn to that.
[01:11:14.891 --> 01:11:17.012]  That's the kind of harassment we deal with.
[01:11:17.012 --> 01:11:17.433]  And I'm like...
[01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:32.833]  This is footage of people splitting people's throats, raping people to death, and because they believe it sends you to hell if you eat human flesh, making black Libyans line up and they're cutting a guy up on a table, feeding him and laughing at him, and then blowing their heads off.
[01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:34.373]  That's the footage we've got.
[01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.114]  Hours of it.
[01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:35.974]  I can't even watch it.
[01:11:37.697 --> 01:11:47.926]  It's little kids with their lower mandibles blown off, their tongues wagging around everywhere, going, meh, meh, they're begging for mama, and the jihadis are laughing and just slap little girls in the face.
[01:11:47.926 --> 01:11:50.488]  Little girl rolls over and blood's squirting out.
[01:11:50.488 --> 01:11:58.496]  And they go, and it's just like a big orgy of satanism, and they all look completely satanic.
[01:12:00.452 --> 01:12:02.273]  Do you see a Comedy Central show saying that's bad?
[01:12:02.273 --> 01:12:03.753]  Do you see an ABC show?
[01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:04.474]  See a news show?
[01:12:04.474 --> 01:12:05.054]  No.
[01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:09.135]  It's all Alex Jones is bad, Alex Jones is evil.
[01:12:09.135 --> 01:12:10.216]  Now that's black and white.
[01:12:10.216 --> 01:12:13.677]  You give me color, HD, hydrogen bombs going off.
[01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:17.458]  That's Pacific bikini testing right there.
[01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.759]  I'll come in the break, it's no big deal.
[01:12:18.759 --> 01:12:20.099]  I'll show you what I want.
[01:12:20.099 --> 01:12:22.560]  Like Trinity and beyond, it's all on YouTube.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.601]  It's all government footage we show.
[01:12:24.702 --> 01:12:46.175]  So, when you realize the satanic force of all this and what we're dealing with, Hillary funded the whole Arab Spring, founded it all, and they ran around killing over a million people, they blew up over a thousand churches in Egypt, and were crucifying the Orthodox and Catholic priests upside down, and CNN wouldn't even report it.
[01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:47.616]  I've got that footage too.
[01:12:47.616 --> 01:12:52.458]  I was sent by the Pentagon.
[01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:53.079]  Pit Patriots.
[01:12:54.465 --> 01:13:04.115]  They had the government building five years ago with people crucified upside down all around it.
[01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:10.681]  Imagine you're so satanic you go to work and you're the guy installed by the CIA and Hillary and Obama and there's Christians.
[01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:11.842]  Yeah, go and put that on screen.
[01:13:11.842 --> 01:13:18.469]  There's Christians crucified upside down
[01:13:22.461 --> 01:13:23.821]  All around you.
[01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:24.421]  That one there's good.
[01:13:24.421 --> 01:13:29.763]  Yeah, let's just have some hydrogen bombs going off for you here today.
[01:13:29.763 --> 01:13:30.403]  If you're a TV viewer.
[01:13:30.403 --> 01:13:35.204]  If you're a radio listener, I'm always directing the TV show in here with a great crew.
[01:13:35.204 --> 01:13:41.085]  So, that's kind of some backdrop about who we're dealing with here.
[01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:48.887]  And, of course, he sent me this footage he got from the Pentagon, and I was sent some similar stuff, and I was like, what in the world is this?
[01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:51.268]  It's the behind-the-scenes stuff that was taken offline
[01:13:52.188 --> 01:13:55.410]  And scooped up, scraped, and I mean, there's hours of it.
[01:13:55.410 --> 01:14:00.192]  You know, one day I sat up here and I made myself watch it.
[01:14:00.192 --> 01:14:03.234]  Only once, and I can't bring myself to play it.
[01:14:03.234 --> 01:14:07.156]  One day we played them cutting the guy up on the table and making the Africans eat it.
[01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:09.437]  And you can hear them calling him the C-word.
[01:14:09.437 --> 01:14:15.520]  I'm not going to say it because they'll edit it and say I said it on CNN, but it's the, it's the, it's a word they use.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.281]  It sounds like calf.
[01:14:17.688 --> 01:14:21.772]  People go, why do South Africans, racist whites, why would they call them the C word?
[01:14:21.772 --> 01:14:23.633]  You see that in lethal weapon about South Africa.
[01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:28.518]  That's actually an accurate point where they were a diplomatic community and could do stuff and they would call people that name.
[01:14:28.518 --> 01:14:31.220]  That's an Arabic term for black people.
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:36.905]  And they're laughing at them while they cry and making them eat the flesh before they blow their heads off.
[01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:45.991]  A satanic religion that believes it's fighting Satan.
[01:14:45.991 --> 01:14:47.174]  How perfect.
[01:14:47.174 --> 01:14:49.238]  Let's go out to break with the best part of the worst part.
[01:14:49.238 --> 01:14:50.662]  Comey talking about Trump's morals.
[01:14:50.662 --> 01:14:50.942]  Here it is.
[01:14:52.970 --> 01:15:02.156]  And then he says something that distracted me, because he said, you know, if there's even a 1% chance my wife thinks that's true, that's terrible.
[01:15:02.156 --> 01:15:09.722]  And I remember thinking, how could your wife think there's a 1% chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?
[01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:10.882]  I'm a flawed human being, but...
[01:15:12.183 --> 01:15:15.945]  There's literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true.
[01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:21.387]  So what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think there's only a 99% chance you didn't do that?
[01:15:21.387 --> 01:15:27.169]  And I said to him, sir, when he started talking about it, I may order you to investigate that.
[01:15:27.169 --> 01:15:28.970]  I said, sir, that's up to you.
[01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:35.153]  But you'd want to be careful about that because it might create a narrative that we're investigating you personally.
[01:15:35.153 --> 01:15:38.934]  And second, it's very difficult to prove something didn't happen.
[01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.135]  Did you believe his denial?
[01:15:40.675 --> 01:15:51.161]  I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don't know whether the... This is a guy that covered up the rest of the corrupt FBI, the Clinton sex crimes, the Clinton pedophile planes, Weiner, all of it.
[01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:56.585]  This is a guy that covered up massive child trafficking by Hillary and her people, on record, telling us about morals.
[01:15:57.492 --> 01:15:59.353]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[01:15:59.353 --> 01:16:07.938]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:13.211]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:18:13.211 --> 01:18:18.295]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:18:18.295 --> 01:18:19.055]  We only have 150%.
[01:18:19.055 --> 01:18:20.176]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:18:22.017 --> 01:18:24.838]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:18:24.838 --> 01:18:28.300]  That means we've got a 25% markup.

[01:21:04.352 --> 01:21:05.832]  Now it's happened!
[01:21:05.832 --> 01:21:09.113]  And now it's happening here.
[01:21:09.113 --> 01:21:11.994]  These people mean business.
[01:21:11.994 --> 01:21:15.095]  They mean business big time.
[01:21:15.095 --> 01:21:20.697]  Nuclear doomsday plane goes airborne as war fears grow.
[01:21:20.697 --> 01:21:25.699]  E-4B Nightwatch allows US to maintain chain of command in event of a major conflict.
[01:21:25.699 --> 01:21:26.899]  The jets go airborne.
[01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:31.970]  And the threat of nuclear war is at a very high level.
[01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:53.966]  I want to open the phones up specifically on the outrageous coming, rebooting the fake PP dossier, the Steele dossier, they admit it's fake, that his criminal network and the FBI, very small group, funded illegally with taxpayer money to their own wives, who only got hired to run it.
[01:21:55.154 --> 01:21:59.975]  And Hillary peeled off a half mill to McCabe's wife.
[01:21:59.975 --> 01:22:03.376]  You're not going to see any raids on McCabe, though it's being looked at.
[01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:04.697]  You're not going to see any of this.
[01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:05.297]  No, no, no.
[01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:09.258]  It's just on Stormy Daniels and 11 years ago.
[01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.319]  And that did Trump have sex with a woman?
[01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:17.400]  That's, oh, Comey earlier, if he just joined us, talked about how immoral it is.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.541]  And now, oh, my God.
[01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:22.862]  Oh, Trump is so bad, even though the PP dossier is not true.
[01:22:24.284 --> 01:22:45.898]  When Comey and Mueller and all the rest of these people, the mainstream media, covered up the Epstein aircraft with the little girls and all the people, Weinstein and Bill Clinton and Hillary, they didn't just do dozens of flights to the little island where little girls are taken, as young as 10 years old, confirmed.
[01:22:45.898 --> 01:22:51.642]  Reportedly, some were bad when sleeping with the little fishy-wishies.
[01:22:51.642 --> 01:22:51.842]  No.
[01:22:53.329 --> 01:22:55.246]  It's more liberal and loving than that.
[01:22:57.625 --> 01:23:06.609]  No, my friends, they would go to special sheiks' houses in the Middle East who had it legalized in their country to have harems of little children and women.
[01:23:06.609 --> 01:23:13.912]  A lot of them are women that are in the hospitality industry who thought they were going to work in one of these countries and the sheik liked you.
[01:23:13.912 --> 01:23:24.097]  And just like his father and his father and his father back to the founding of the great jihad, went to Spain and other areas, went to Greece.
[01:23:25.337 --> 01:23:31.981]  Went to Italy, even to the gates of Rome, to take the women back.
[01:23:31.981 --> 01:23:35.964]  And to give them the freedom of Islam.
[01:23:35.964 --> 01:23:41.847]  To give them the freedom of being in the torture chamber.
[01:23:41.847 --> 01:23:46.910]  The harem full of the women.
[01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:53.294]  And your women are ours, don't you worry about that.
[01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.135]  Good for you.
[01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:59.374]  Now, I want to give the number out.
[01:23:59.374 --> 01:24:01.615]  On this open line Friday, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:24:01.615 --> 01:24:03.396]  First time callers in the first round.
[01:24:03.396 --> 01:24:04.016]  Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[01:24:12.628 --> 01:24:19.191]  Who used to be the head of psychological operations, he's a psychiatrist and a medical doctor and a bunch of other stuff from the State Department.
[01:24:19.191 --> 01:24:23.293]  Of course, the State Department runs the CIA, so he wouldn't be in the CIA, he was in the group that ran the CIA.
[01:24:23.293 --> 01:24:26.754]  Is there anybody that talks about being in the CIA being so cool?
[01:24:26.754 --> 01:24:31.076]  No, the CIA is bigger than Coca-Cola, and it's not bad if you were in the CIA.
[01:24:31.076 --> 01:24:35.878]  There's a lot of people in there that aren't bad people, but at the top it's a bunch of globalists.
[01:24:35.878 --> 01:24:39.080]  And they use real men and real women to do the fighting and the killing and everything else.
[01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:50.580]  Because they're a bunch of cowards that sit around talking about how powerful they are, like Clapper and Brennan and all these little knuckle-dragging demons.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.805]  But all the people I ever talked to that were in the CIA, even going back to when I was a kid,
[01:24:56.704 --> 01:25:17.542]  Talked about how bad the globalists were in the New World Order, and how great the John Birch Society was, and how we were going to stop their world government and their cashless society, and that there'd be a Pope coming up who'd call for world government and would basically deny Christ and all of its happening.
[01:25:17.542 --> 01:25:22.387]  One thing the globalists do, I've got an article here today about, is the end of the world here, Sunday Express,
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.101]  And they can always find some church or somebody obsessed with numerology who's saying, this is the date.
[01:25:28.101 --> 01:25:31.302]  I can't tell you how many times that's happened in my life.
[01:25:31.302 --> 01:25:32.942]  Well, the Bible says, watch out.
[01:25:32.942 --> 01:25:36.043]  In fact, pull up the quotes if we can.
[01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:40.084]  Watch out for those that say they know the hour of the time, for no man knoweth the time.
[01:25:40.084 --> 01:25:49.806]  And those that tell you they know the time are false prophets, because Christ will come like a thief in the night.
[01:25:49.806 --> 01:25:50.926]  And we're all raptured by
[01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:59.854]  The gravity weapon being released and the whole solar system evaporating instantly.
[01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.155]  Anyways, continuing.
[01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:03.616]  End of the world 2018.
[01:26:03.616 --> 01:26:06.538]  Will the rapture occur on April 23rd?
[01:26:06.538 --> 01:26:10.160]  Shock prediction says.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.702]  According to conspiracy theorists, that means people that question.
[01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:16.244]  When it's mainline orthodoxy, then it's hmm.
[01:26:16.244 --> 01:26:19.406]  Codes in the Bible suggest the end of the world is imminent.
[01:26:19.406 --> 01:26:21.027]  With Earth set to be destroyed April 23rd.
[01:26:23.797 --> 01:26:29.460]  Well, I can't say the Earth doesn't deserve it, but there's still a lot of innocence on the planet, so I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:36.904]  But, we could really have another Atlantean moment, whether you believe in Atlantis or not, where we destroy most life on Earth.
[01:26:36.904 --> 01:26:39.065]  You know, Plato wrote a lot of stuff that was true.
[01:26:39.065 --> 01:26:43.547]  He's also the father of eugenics, the father of modern elitism, and royalty, and the whole nine yards.
[01:26:43.547 --> 01:26:46.068]  Chief of the architecture we now live under.
[01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:50.150]  You could call him the leader.
[01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:50.751]  Der Fuehrer.
[01:26:52.332 --> 01:27:05.815]  Probably the most important man that's ever lived other than Christ, who was no man as we know, but God avatared on the planet, jacked in to walk amongst us.
[01:27:05.815 --> 01:27:07.055]  Now it all makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:11.736]  And the globalists all know that, and they put it out in their cosmologies now, in movies, everywhere, they get it now.
[01:27:11.736 --> 01:27:14.077]  They're like, oh my God, this is all real, it's all coming true.
[01:27:14.077 --> 01:27:18.978]  And now they've all adopted the Bible, but they think they're gonna use it as a cheat sheet to get out of it.
[01:27:21.104 --> 01:27:25.669]  There's not a Hollywood or a top engineer or not a globalist that doesn't know what's going on, folks.
[01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:26.650]  They know.
[01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:27.250]  They know.
[01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:30.914]  But they've picked the wrong side.
[01:27:30.914 --> 01:27:33.277]  The god of this world.
[01:27:33.277 --> 01:27:39.303]  The ten-horned, psychic, interdimensional dictator.
[01:27:39.303 --> 01:27:42.126]  That they think is a god and they're gonna follow right into hell.
[01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:48.685]  Don't fear those that can kill the body, fear those that can kill the soul.
[01:27:48.685 --> 01:27:50.646]  And as I said, if you pull up, can we pull up the Bible verse?
[01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:56.268]  I don't know the exact, cause no man know at the time, but it's this constant thing.
[01:27:56.268 --> 01:28:01.109]  And then I was picking up Italian food about five years ago.
[01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:05.971]  And it was that other big church that said the other world was coming and the media made fun of the old guy and all that.
[01:28:05.971 --> 01:28:08.732]  And I was in there getting food, one out about 6.30, taking it home.
[01:28:08.732 --> 01:28:09.712]  My wife wanted Italian food.
[01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:18.450]  Guy behind the counter giving it to me.
[01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:22.334]  He's had a glass of wine while I was waiting for the food to come.
[01:28:22.334 --> 01:28:23.715]  He goes, Alex, I see your show and all this.
[01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.476]  You don't really agree with these dumb Christians, do you?
[01:28:25.476 --> 01:28:27.418]  You know, because they just said the world was going to end last week.
[01:28:27.418 --> 01:28:27.798]  It didn't end.
[01:28:27.798 --> 01:28:28.499]  Do you believe that?
[01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:30.220]  I said, that's all pushed by the media.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.363]  Just because some quack says something doesn't mean that's the case.
[01:28:33.363 --> 01:28:38.087]  But if you don't think the stuff in Revelations, world government, a mark to buy and sell,
[01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:46.738]  Giant mountains of fire that destroy whole armies of giant flying metal insects that fire flaming spears out, helicopters.
[01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:52.924]  You don't go look at Egyptian tombs with perfect Cobra attack helicopters carved on the wall and it's like, something's going on!
[01:28:52.924 --> 01:28:54.205]  Something's going on!
[01:28:54.205 --> 01:28:55.526]  I don't know what, but it's big!
[01:28:57.361 --> 01:28:58.101]  Face it.
[01:28:58.101 --> 01:29:00.962]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[01:29:00.962 --> 01:29:08.225]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days, or even decades in the most dire scenarios.

[01:29:27.591 --> 01:29:28.391]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:29:28.391 --> 01:29:30.192]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:31.833]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:34.655]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:34.655 --> 01:29:36.956]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:41.459]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:45.401]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:45.401 --> 01:29:49.183]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:49.623]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:29:49.623 --> 01:29:51.244]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:58.246 --> 01:30:01.027]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:30:01.027 --> 01:30:11.512]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:30:11.512 --> 01:30:12.292]  Scalability.
[01:30:12.292 --> 01:30:14.613]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:30:14.613 --> 01:30:16.294]  So there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:30:20.316 --> 01:30:21.536]  of ingredient MycoZX.
[01:30:21.536 --> 01:30:23.177]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[01:30:23.177 --> 01:30:32.800]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:41.662]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:30:41.662 --> 01:30:47.624]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:30:48.084 --> 01:30:50.447]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.

[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.680]  They take hours.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:07.121]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.121 --> 01:31:08.301]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.301 --> 01:31:09.902]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:09.902 --> 01:31:13.123]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.123 --> 01:31:14.243]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.243 --> 01:31:17.424]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.424 --> 01:31:21.205]  It's got the preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.205 --> 01:31:24.306]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:31:24.306 --> 01:31:25.186]  So you can upload it.
[01:31:25.186 --> 01:31:31.508]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is

[01:31:36.592 --> 01:31:42.656]  It's a supplement with iodine Super high quality silver and a lot more without you.
[01:31:42.656 --> 01:31:56.287]  We couldn't do it So thank you all for remembering in for store.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake But it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word again Thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution
[01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:01.282]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:03.044]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:03.044 --> 01:32:14.316]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.097 --> 01:32:24.262]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:24.262 --> 01:32:34.807]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:35.327 --> 01:32:37.948]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:32:37.948 --> 01:32:39.669]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:49.674]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.674 --> 01:32:52.295]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.295 --> 01:33:01.200]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.734 --> 01:33:30.598]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.598 --> 01:33:32.359]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[01:33:32.359 --> 01:33:35.480]  Anthrax on radio!
[01:33:43.405 --> 01:33:44.185]  All right, welcome back.
[01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.406]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:33:45.406 --> 01:33:46.807]  I've already hit some of the news.
[01:33:46.807 --> 01:33:47.907]  There's so much more here.
[01:33:47.907 --> 01:33:54.930]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:33:54.930 --> 01:34:02.474]  I was brought up to be extremely tolerant of everybody.
[01:34:02.474 --> 01:34:10.718]  And then I studied history, and I saw how all these other groups are extremely militaristic, tribalistic,
[01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:15.272]  Monotheistic.
[01:34:15.272 --> 01:34:20.256]  Barbaristic.
[01:34:20.256 --> 01:34:22.398]  Piratical.
[01:34:22.398 --> 01:34:24.840]  Fanatical.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.084]  Delusional.
[01:34:29.084 --> 01:34:32.587]  Usurpers.
[01:34:32.587 --> 01:34:35.690]  There are more than 50 Muslim countries
[01:34:39.087 --> 01:34:43.614]  There's Muslim countries and then no other religions basically allowed.
[01:34:43.614 --> 01:34:50.403]  The fewer it is, our government's trying to overthrow it and turn it over to the radical jihadis from Egypt to Syria.
[01:34:50.403 --> 01:34:51.445]  There's two different types of countries.
[01:34:51.445 --> 01:34:53.949]  There's Islamic countries and there's not Islamic countries.
[01:34:55.031 --> 01:35:23.631]  And then I look at the doubling of Christian persecution last decade, and Obama honchoing that, and the Pope coming out and bad-mouthing, and being a globalist, and Apple and Google delisting Easter and other Christian holidays, and just the animus, and I'm sitting here going, and then now the family's bad, and mother and father, and it's not just the universities, it's everywhere, and these people are on power trips, and they're criminals, and I'm not even talking about the Muslims there, but the sick, nihilistic,
[01:35:24.924 --> 01:35:30.370]  Freakazoid left.
[01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:31.992]  I mean, we've all gone to leftist rallies.
[01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.093]  I mean, they're ugly.
[01:35:33.093 --> 01:35:33.894]  They're stupid.
[01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.096]  They can't talk.
[01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.397]  No one will talk to you.
[01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:38.139]  They only have talking points.
[01:35:38.139 --> 01:35:41.983]  They act mentally ill.
[01:35:41.983 --> 01:35:44.006]  The higher caste is vicious.
[01:35:46.988 --> 01:36:01.751]  The kind of professor, management class, and you're like, my God, these are people that bought into the New World Order, bought into globalism, bought into their post-modernism, and they, I just keep going back to this, they hate you, okay?
[01:36:01.751 --> 01:36:14.413]  I just want to keep, like an emergency beacon, they hate you, they hate you, they hate you, they want to take what you've got, they want to kill you, they want to destroy you, they are just, and it's the realization that there aren't any liberals anymore.
[01:36:16.266 --> 01:36:21.108]  Liberals used to have a lot of good points about free speech and anti-war and good things.
[01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.669]  Those were classical liberals.
[01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:24.649]  They're gone!
[01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:30.772]  Because through virtue signalings and political correctness, they by successive approximation, by increment,
[01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:39.446]  Have gotten the average Democrat to accept anything, and now you open up mainline newspapers.
[01:36:39.446 --> 01:36:40.847]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:36:40.847 --> 01:36:42.028]  Christians are bad.
[01:36:42.028 --> 01:36:43.089]  The family is bad.
[01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:45.431]  And you're like, where do they go next?
[01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:47.152]  Arresting people?
[01:36:47.152 --> 01:36:53.297]  Forced re-education?
[01:36:53.297 --> 01:36:54.618]  I've had these lepers on the air.
[01:36:54.618 --> 01:36:55.879]  I've been out to dinner with them years ago.
[01:36:55.879 --> 01:37:02.084]  And they'll always invariably say, Alex, if you don't get what we want, we're going to put you in a re-education camp.
[01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:12.141]  And they invariably sit there and go, Alex, we're not really liberal civil rights activists, we're communists and we're going to kill a bunch of people when we take over.
[01:37:14.966 --> 01:37:25.653]  And me and Rob Dewar were sitting there at dinner once with a prominent civil rights activist, and they had three or four tequilas, and they're talking about how much they want to murder everybody.
[01:37:25.653 --> 01:37:29.315]  And you know, the first couple times that happens, you think, oh, we got a bad apple.
[01:37:29.315 --> 01:37:29.996]  No.
[01:37:29.996 --> 01:37:33.918]  Those of us that aren't ravenous demons are blind.
[01:37:33.918 --> 01:37:36.620]  We do not understand what we're up against.
[01:37:38.021 --> 01:37:46.305]  Why would the neocons and the Democrats want to blow up the Russians when they're trying to exit Syria when we know the rebels have staged it at least three times?
[01:37:46.305 --> 01:37:48.686]  Why would we do that?
[01:37:48.686 --> 01:37:50.387]  Why would they rush to do it?
[01:37:50.387 --> 01:37:53.369]  Why would they know the Russians will retaliate?
[01:37:53.369 --> 01:37:55.650]  Because it's thrilling to psychopaths.
[01:37:57.947 --> 01:38:06.534]  To push Russia, like they pushed them out of Iraq, and they pushed them out of Libya, and they pushed them out of Serbia, and they let the Muslims, the radical Muslims, take over everywhere.
[01:38:06.534 --> 01:38:08.876]  You see where the globals are allied for a long time now.
[01:38:08.876 --> 01:38:10.598]  Demographically, they've decided to go with them.
[01:38:10.598 --> 01:38:12.479]  There'll be 3 billion Muslims by 2025, according to the UN.
[01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:28.820]  And every Muslim that lets Christians and Jews and others live in peace, that tries to put in hotels, and swimming pools, and lets people have rock and roll music, every one of them gets killed or overthrown.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:37.087]  Except for Assad, whose father did some bad stuff, and I didn't agree with him, and Assad's been a dictator, he's trying to phase out.
[01:38:37.087 --> 01:38:41.932]  He thought the West, the same time Gaddafi 10 years ago, 11 years ago thought, oh,
[01:38:43.137 --> 01:38:44.038]  You want to work with us?
[01:38:44.038 --> 01:38:45.459]  Sure, we'll modernize, we'll let you in.
[01:38:45.459 --> 01:38:48.842]  It was all a double-cross to let the operatives in to set them up.
[01:38:48.842 --> 01:38:55.127]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:38:55.127 --> 01:38:56.128]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[01:38:58.143 --> 01:39:06.430]  We're going to go to Jason and Mark and Katherine and Jason and Caroline and Brandon and many others.
[01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:07.451]  What do you think about Comey?
[01:39:07.451 --> 01:39:09.232]  What do you think about all the craziness?
[01:39:09.232 --> 01:39:15.357]  The constitutional crisis, the out-of-control special counsel, the China trade war, China's trade surplus with the U.S.
[01:39:15.357 --> 01:39:16.879]  soars.
[01:39:16.879 --> 01:39:19.461]  Yeah, it used to be $500 billion a few years ago.
[01:39:19.461 --> 01:39:20.362]  Now it's $900 billion.
[01:39:20.362 --> 01:39:23.064]  And Trump's trying to stop the bleeding.
[01:39:23.064 --> 01:39:23.844]  There's almost nothing left.
[01:39:25.028 --> 01:39:27.835]  And the media's like, shut up, you horrible person!
[01:39:27.835 --> 01:39:31.684]  They got $900 billion on us, you don't put $50 billion on them!
[01:39:31.684 --> 01:39:33.027]  That's not fair, racist!
[01:39:39.451 --> 01:39:42.834]  I mean, that's all Trump really is, is like a tourniquet on her leg, chopped off.
[01:39:42.834 --> 01:39:46.197]  And the media and everybody else is like, no, no, no.
[01:39:46.197 --> 01:39:52.822]  Take the tourniquet off, because we're going to bankrupt America, and we're going to teach the bitter clingers, everybody else, how to come to heel.
[01:39:52.822 --> 01:39:55.965]  You all got worthless degrees, by design, declassified.
[01:39:55.965 --> 01:39:57.806]  You've all got a screwed up culture.
[01:39:57.806 --> 01:40:06.614]  Everything's been shut down, and you're still fighting to keep that little farm, and still fighting to work at the gas station, and still fighting to fly Old Glory, still fighting to go to church.
[01:40:09.138 --> 01:40:10.819]  We're gonna flood your community with opium.
[01:40:10.819 --> 01:40:12.501]  How you like that?
[01:40:12.501 --> 01:40:14.562]  We're gonna flood it with MTV.
[01:40:14.562 --> 01:40:19.926]  We're gonna flood it with all this trash.
[01:40:19.926 --> 01:40:22.268]  Because they've hired all this scum to be mercenaries.
[01:40:24.704 --> 01:40:29.246]  And they sit there and psychologically know how to track them and their web history and who they are.
[01:40:29.246 --> 01:40:31.187]  They got it down in algorithms.
[01:40:31.187 --> 01:40:41.312]  And boy, they got an algorithm on me, and I'm not saying I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread, but their algorithm came up with me, and they said, stop that guy right there.
[01:40:41.312 --> 01:40:42.252]  They're like, well, we'll kill him.
[01:40:42.252 --> 01:40:43.613]  They're like, that'll make him a martyr.
[01:40:43.613 --> 01:40:45.574]  Kill his name first, then we'll kill him.
[01:40:47.844 --> 01:40:52.907]  Well, just like you arrogant people thought you'd steal the election and all the rest of that stuff, you're not in charge.
[01:40:52.907 --> 01:40:54.609]  Human will is.
[01:40:54.609 --> 01:40:56.810]  And God is when we ask God into the equation.
[01:40:56.810 --> 01:41:01.333]  So it's time to get on our knees and seek God's face and repent for what we've done.
[01:41:01.333 --> 01:41:02.214]  And God will come in.
[01:41:03.854 --> 01:41:06.155]  And Lee got into reckless, but you've got to have courage.
[01:41:06.155 --> 01:41:10.198]  And here's the thing, once you really get discernment, you go, oh my God, it isn't even courage.
[01:41:10.198 --> 01:41:11.359]  How did I not fight this before?
[01:41:11.359 --> 01:41:12.059]  They're so evil.
[01:41:12.059 --> 01:41:12.779]  They're so bad.
[01:41:12.779 --> 01:41:15.661]  We got to fight because you know they're coming and they're bad.
[01:41:15.661 --> 01:41:16.682]  It's not courage.
[01:41:16.682 --> 01:41:18.323]  It's self-preservation.
[01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:19.764]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:19.764 --> 01:41:21.665]  I don't have courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:21.665 --> 01:41:23.686]  I've seen the enemy.
[01:41:23.686 --> 01:41:25.227]  We got to fight.
[01:41:25.227 --> 01:41:26.848]  It's all we got.
[01:41:26.848 --> 01:41:28.269]  And if we fight, we're going to win.
[01:41:31.476 --> 01:41:36.118]  For God's sake, so break their condition and come out of the trance and let's beat them, because they're bad news.
[01:41:36.118 --> 01:41:39.320]  Now, we can stand against the Soros-funded lawsuits.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:47.284]  We know he's funding them, because they're all ridiculous and we're getting them thrown out, but it costs money and it takes research and it's meant to weigh us down on our time.
[01:41:47.284 --> 01:41:51.186]  I need people to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get products you already need so it's a win-win.
[01:41:51.186 --> 01:41:52.107]  Just do it.
[01:41:52.107 --> 01:41:59.691]  If you haven't ever supported us, InfoWarsTore.com, water filters, air filters, non-GMO heirloom seeds, a wide selection, one of the widest, high quality.
[01:42:02.133 --> 01:42:14.323]  We are going to sell out a pure, affordable, high-quality iodine, Survival Shield X2, the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, and the price is going up, and we're over a barrel with the suppliers.
[01:42:14.323 --> 01:42:14.884]  It's deeper.
[01:42:14.884 --> 01:42:19.988]  Nobody else has this source, and I don't like the fact that, you know, it's sold out a lot because we can't get it.
[01:42:19.988 --> 01:42:21.289]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:42:21.289 --> 01:42:25.432]  I don't know how long we'll even have X2, and I hate to have to announce that news when people are buying it up.
[01:42:25.432 --> 01:42:28.295]  We've got enough for a few more manufacturing runs, and then I don't know.
[01:42:29.525 --> 01:42:30.565]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:30.565 --> 01:42:35.086]  If you want X2 and you see what it's done for you and others or heard what it's done, try it out today.
[01:42:35.086 --> 01:42:35.847]  Save big on it.
[01:42:35.847 --> 01:42:41.028]  25% off despite the fact it's selling out and it may be gone forever after two more runs.
[01:42:41.028 --> 01:42:45.329]  Page rip point rewards at Infowarstore.com aren't 5 points for every dollar.
[01:42:45.329 --> 01:42:46.189]  They're 5%.
[01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.710]  They're now 10%.
[01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:47.790]  That's huge.
[01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:48.670]  Check that out.
[01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:50.310]  We've got a lot of other specials right now.
[01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:53.371]  Bodies, Ultimate Tumor Formula is back in.
[01:42:53.371 --> 01:42:54.011]  25% off as well.
[01:42:54.011 --> 01:42:55.532]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:55.532 --> 01:42:55.832]  Thank you.
[01:42:57.529 --> 01:43:03.833]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:43:03.833 --> 01:43:12.258]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[01:43:12.258 --> 01:43:17.322]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:43:17.322 --> 01:43:18.082]  We only have 150%.
[01:43:18.082 --> 01:43:19.203]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:43:21.044 --> 01:43:23.866]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[01:43:23.866 --> 01:43:32.291]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:34.132]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:43:34.132 --> 01:43:35.633]  But the two go together.
[01:43:35.633 --> 01:43:37.655]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:43:37.655 --> 01:43:42.017]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[01:43:43.218 --> 01:43:47.123]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:47.123 --> 01:43:52.329]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[01:43:52.329 --> 01:43:57.174]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[01:43:57.174 --> 01:43:59.897]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife.
[01:44:00.578 --> 01:44:04.540]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:07.882]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:44:07.882 --> 01:44:10.423]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:44:10.423 --> 01:44:15.146]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:44:15.146 --> 01:44:17.487]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:44:17.487 --> 01:44:23.891]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:24.511 --> 01:44:32.694]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:32.694 --> 01:44:37.756]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:44:37.756 --> 01:44:44.739]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:44:45.399 --> 01:44:50.309]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:44:50.309 --> 01:44:53.236]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:57.728 --> 01:45:05.194]  Did President Trump nearly fire special counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of some fake news?
[01:45:05.194 --> 01:45:14.020]  According to a New York Times article published this week, Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his bank records.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:19.044]  The Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Mueller probe.
[01:45:19.044 --> 01:45:26.870]  The stories about the bank subpoenas, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg, turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction.
[01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:30.432]  Noting the subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates.
[01:45:30.432 --> 01:45:31.673]  This week, the president tweeted,
[01:45:57.630 --> 01:46:03.035]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:03.035 --> 01:46:05.897]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:46:05.897 --> 01:46:07.859]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:46:07.859 --> 01:46:12.883]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:46:12.883 --> 01:46:14.984]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:46:14.984 --> 01:46:16.285]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:46:16.285 --> 01:46:21.409]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:46:21.409 --> 01:46:24.752]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:46:24.892 --> 01:46:25.412]  We're good to go.
[01:46:47.190 --> 01:46:48.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:22.542]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.542 --> 01:47:28.470]  I don't want to say we dodged a bullet from Trump talking about firing smart missiles at the Russians in Syria on Wednesday.
[01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:31.250]  They've got the doomsday planes in the air.
[01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:34.071]  Trump still says he may hit the targets.
[01:47:34.071 --> 01:47:41.113]  But you notice the Defense Secretary on Thursday said, we don't have evidence that the Syrians did this, that the Syrian government did this.
[01:47:41.113 --> 01:47:42.233]  Yeah, they don't have the motive.
[01:47:42.233 --> 01:47:43.053]  They're winning.
[01:47:43.053 --> 01:47:45.174]  The Russians are pulling out.
[01:47:45.174 --> 01:47:47.534]  The rebels have been caught doing it before.
[01:47:47.534 --> 01:47:59.057]  If I live on a block and somebody has stolen cars three times in the last year, and it's a known juvenile delinquent that's 14 years old, if another car gets stolen,
[01:48:01.428 --> 01:48:07.733]  Do you go to one of the owners of the cars and blame them, or do you go, wait, Billy's stolen three cars this year.
[01:48:07.733 --> 01:48:11.236]  Sure enough, you go find Billy, he's got the car.
[01:48:11.236 --> 01:48:12.757]  But that doesn't even matter.
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:15.139]  You don't have proof, and it's rushed to war.
[01:48:15.139 --> 01:48:16.680]  We don't know who did it this time.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.503]  It hasn't come out like the last three times it was the rebels.
[01:48:20.503 --> 01:48:24.386]  The problem is the globalists will stage more false flanks.
[01:48:24.386 --> 01:48:26.008]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:48:27.196 --> 01:48:45.451]  That Trump, a week after he says, I wanna pull out of Syria, six days later actually, I looked it up last night, six days after he says we're pulling out, two days later he goes, well, the Pentagon doesn't want me to, but we're gonna try, boom, terror attack, we gotta stay.
[01:48:45.451 --> 01:48:49.815]  On civilians, the exact move the Syrians don't want, is what they do.
[01:48:49.815 --> 01:48:51.196]  Riddle me that, Batman.
[01:48:51.196 --> 01:48:54.439]  So we're taking your phone calls,
[01:48:58.885 --> 01:49:01.626]  Pompeo's nomination is facing challenging Senate vote.
[01:49:01.626 --> 01:49:03.786]  That's on NewsWars.com right now.
[01:49:03.786 --> 01:49:08.547]  Pompeo's been drooling over, don't worry, we already killed a lot of Russians.
[01:49:08.547 --> 01:49:12.308]  Yeah, how dare them come in at our behest and work with us to take out ISIS.
[01:49:12.308 --> 01:49:13.108]  Now we want them out.
[01:49:13.108 --> 01:49:14.929]  This is all the Russia stuff.
[01:49:14.929 --> 01:49:17.029]  We've killed a lot of them.
[01:49:17.029 --> 01:49:20.670]  Yeah, they're out there at airfields working and stuff and loading the planes to bomb out ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:21.210]  We killed them.
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:21.790]  We killed them.
[01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:22.150]  We're good.
[01:49:22.150 --> 01:49:22.610]  We're good.
[01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:23.450]  We killed a lot of them.
[01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:24.211]  I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:24.211 --> 01:49:24.771]  I'm not a Russian.
[01:49:24.771 --> 01:49:25.111]  I promise.
[01:49:25.111 --> 01:49:25.811]  I killed a bunch of them.
[01:49:25.811 --> 01:49:26.251]  I'm really good.
[01:49:27.341 --> 01:49:28.766]  And I'll give you a nuclear war to prove I'm not bad.
[01:49:28.766 --> 01:49:29.087]  Okay?
[01:49:31.249 --> 01:49:34.191]  Jason in Florida, though, goes ahead of the line.
[01:49:34.191 --> 01:49:35.952]  By the way, we have a great computer system.
[01:49:35.952 --> 01:49:37.853]  We've got a new phone system, and it glitched out.
[01:49:37.853 --> 01:49:38.753]  I don't know.
[01:49:38.753 --> 01:49:39.954]  These are better than the old analog ones.
[01:49:39.954 --> 01:49:42.816]  We can take a hundred calls at a time, but it just glitches and hangs up on people.
[01:49:42.816 --> 01:49:46.718]  So it just hung up on a bunch of people, so people are calling back in.
[01:49:46.718 --> 01:49:47.018]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:49:47.018 --> 01:49:49.020]  But Jason, he didn't glitch.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.462]  Either it's Steven or Mark or Caroline, so we'll go to them.
[01:49:52.462 --> 01:49:55.463]  Jason in Florida disagrees with me.
[01:49:55.463 --> 01:49:56.724]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:49:56.724 --> 01:49:57.445]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:57.445 --> 01:49:58.185]  What up, Alex?
[01:49:58.911 --> 01:50:00.851]  I have two points.
[01:50:00.851 --> 01:50:04.332]  My last point, we'll put a cherry on top, a bowtie on my first point.
[01:50:04.332 --> 01:50:09.053]  My first point is this, Alex.
[01:50:09.053 --> 01:50:11.654]  We are not in a war with the globalists.
[01:50:11.654 --> 01:50:17.775]  Because a war implies that both sides are engaged, at least both sides.
[01:50:17.775 --> 01:50:20.476]  We are not engaging the globalists.
[01:50:20.476 --> 01:50:23.016]  We are not engaged, we are not engaging.
[01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:27.237]  We are basically clueless, and they are
[01:50:28.065 --> 01:50:30.087]  We're under siege.
[01:50:30.087 --> 01:50:40.634]  And if the people of this country, especially the military, ever stood up to the globalists, it would be over very quickly.
[01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:55.785]  And that's where I feel like, and I'm going to preface this, big fan of yours, but I do believe that you are deliberately misleading people in saying that we can't fight the globalists physically.
[01:50:57.353 --> 01:51:15.146]  Um, and I think you probably have reasons for that, maybe legal reasons, but, um, we have to, because historically, and you know this, this is why I believe it's deliberate, you know historically there's never been a war that's been won, not physically.
[01:51:15.146 --> 01:51:18.888]  Alright, let me talk, let me, hold on, put him on hold.
[01:51:18.888 --> 01:51:21.610]  No, no, you just had a minute, I'm gonna talk now.
[01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:23.832]  I understand it makes everybody big man.
[01:51:25.765 --> 01:51:30.327]  To call in and then tell people I'm a bad person without evidence of it.
[01:51:30.327 --> 01:51:34.550]  I morally do what I think is best here on air.
[01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:38.712]  And if you know about the committees of correspondence, I'll go back to you in a minute, Jason.
[01:51:38.712 --> 01:51:51.699]  For a decade before the Revolutionary War in 1775, officially 1776, people had to redress some grievances, they educated people, they exposed what was going on, they tried to fix it peacefully.
[01:51:51.699 --> 01:51:51.999]  That's A.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:52:08.028]  B, everybody that always calls in or comments on the website wanting violence saying I'm a wimp because I'm not calling, you know, for war and saying saddle up, let's put our helmets on and get our guns.
[01:52:08.028 --> 01:52:08.748]  What are they doing?
[01:52:08.748 --> 01:52:11.130]  They're always waiting on somebody else to lead it.
[01:52:11.130 --> 01:52:13.911]  And I'm not calling for you to be violent and call my bluffs.
[01:52:13.911 --> 01:52:15.913]  It's not a bluff, sir.
[01:52:15.913 --> 01:52:24.358]  The globalists stage false flags against themselves like Oklahoma City and others and provocateur others and let other events happen like what you saw.
[01:52:26.445 --> 01:52:28.847]  In Florida, they didn't stage it, but they knew it was coming.
[01:52:28.847 --> 01:52:33.930]  They stood down, yet again, in a blue city.
[01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:39.054]  So this idea that I'm not doing enough up here on air, I'm one of their main enemies.
[01:52:39.054 --> 01:52:39.975]  Trump has got in.
[01:52:39.975 --> 01:52:41.376]  He's restoring a lot of sovereignty.
[01:52:41.376 --> 01:52:42.316]  Pulled us out of the TPP.
[01:52:43.285 --> 01:52:44.245]  Did a lot of other stuff.
[01:52:44.245 --> 01:52:48.427]  They just hate him because he's actually being a president.
[01:52:48.427 --> 01:52:53.890]  Victor Orban is closing the borders, kicking the Islamist out, standing up against Soros and the globalists.
[01:52:53.890 --> 01:52:58.032]  Brazil, Spain, Iceland, the UK.
[01:52:59.568 --> 01:53:02.070]  People are waking up to global government.
[01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:21.682]  The globalists in their own publications, the Financial Times of London, Atlantic Monthly, Foreign Affairs of the CFR say, we're in crisis, we're under total attack by individuals highly motivated, waking up, who want self-determination, and nation-states are coming back, and people realize that productivity and free market's better, and that globalism has screwed them over, and is a vertical integration.
[01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:27.454]  And just five years ago, we admitted that we wanted a technocracy and authoritarianism, and they're pissed, and what are we going to do?
[01:53:27.454 --> 01:53:32.898]  And the answer is, well, Communist China will come in and run Davos as the public Bilderberg, and we'll defeat them.
[01:53:32.898 --> 01:53:33.518]  We've taken giant...
[01:53:38.254 --> 01:53:43.056]  Multi-level, by orders of magnitude, leaps against them.
[01:53:43.056 --> 01:53:51.500]  Where now, there are at least ten national TV programs, five nights a week, four nights a week, one night a week, that openly attack me and lie about me.
[01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:56.182]  Not just news programs, but Hollywood is obsessed, the comic books are everywhere attacking me.
[01:53:56.182 --> 01:53:56.622]  Why?
[01:53:56.622 --> 01:54:01.505]  Because we're here exposing that globalism is unelected, it's offshore, it's tax-exempt.
[01:54:02.305 --> 01:54:06.529]  It plays groups off against each other, it's amoral, and people are listening.
[01:54:06.529 --> 01:54:08.811]  We had Nigel Farage on yesterday.
[01:54:08.811 --> 01:54:11.693]  Nationalist parties are taking control of the EU Parliament.
[01:54:11.693 --> 01:54:12.894]  It's elected.
[01:54:12.894 --> 01:54:17.578]  The bureaucracy's not, so they've got them taking it over to expose it, to dismantle it.
[01:54:17.578 --> 01:54:18.879]  We're on the march.
[01:54:18.879 --> 01:54:21.842]  The empire's on the run.
[01:54:21.842 --> 01:54:25.024]  And there's this instant gratification thing.
[01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:29.248]  I mean, if you knew, and I'm not whining, but if you knew
[01:54:31.428 --> 01:54:39.371]  The stuff they've done to me behind the scenes, if you had any idea, it's made me stronger quite frankly.
[01:54:39.371 --> 01:54:46.253]  It's one thing to say you're fearless, it's another thing to actually go through it all and just be a completely stronger person on the other side.
[01:54:46.253 --> 01:54:50.594]  Committed, my will and spirit have never been stronger.
[01:54:50.594 --> 01:54:53.295]  So when I get mad at you, it's because you call in
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:10.834]  And just authoritatively say that I am holding back calling for violence when I've already had them try to take my children, lie about me, 17 lawsuits, death threat stuff.
[01:55:10.834 --> 01:55:14.978]  You couldn't imagine paying off people I knew for 14 years to tell lies about me.
[01:55:14.978 --> 01:55:20.003]  And I know that they've let me know the increases, the threat just goes up from there.
[01:55:20.003 --> 01:55:20.964]  That's just the warning.
[01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:30.594]  So, I've got a full globalist demonization campaign at the level they have when they launch a war against another country.
[01:55:30.594 --> 01:55:34.016]  They're launching propaganda against me, the European and U.S.
[01:55:34.016 --> 01:55:38.598]  press, like I'm a foreign government.
[01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:42.341]  I'm under the level of attack that governments before wars are under.
[01:55:42.341 --> 01:55:46.503]  Now, does anybody kind of think maybe we're covering something that's important?
[01:55:46.503 --> 01:55:48.184]  Maybe the system's scared of something?
[01:55:49.735 --> 01:55:59.721]  They're scared because the military and intelligence agencies listen, because they know I'm on target, know what I'm talking about, and we've already taken back much of the bureaucracy at the level where the rubber meets the road.
[01:55:59.721 --> 01:56:01.603]  You got a minute to finish up.
[01:56:01.603 --> 01:56:02.443]  Go ahead.
[01:56:02.443 --> 01:56:05.625]  Tell me how I can be a better person, Jason.
[01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:06.926]  Alex, I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:08.387]  I have deep respect for you.
[01:56:08.387 --> 01:56:12.610]  I know you're a good person, and just by what you always say.
[01:56:13.747 --> 01:56:16.489]  Uh, it's the fruit of the tree that you can tell it on.
[01:56:16.489 --> 01:56:18.311]  But I want to make my final point is this.
[01:56:18.311 --> 01:56:20.412]  So there's no good fruit from Infowars?
[01:56:20.412 --> 01:56:21.233]  There's no good fruit?
[01:56:21.233 --> 01:56:22.053]  No, no.
[01:56:22.053 --> 01:56:22.674]  No, not at all.
[01:56:22.674 --> 01:56:24.075]  I'm saying the exact opposite.
[01:56:24.075 --> 01:56:26.196]  But here's my final point.
[01:56:26.196 --> 01:56:40.387]  I want to call right now on the United States military and the intelligence agencies to stand up, go rogue, take out the globalists, engage right now, and we'll end this and we'll have freedom and liberty 1776 worldwide.
[01:56:40.387 --> 01:56:41.227]  That's it.
[01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:41.728]  Done.
[01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:41.848]  Out.
[01:56:44.707 --> 01:56:46.668]  Well, I've said this.
[01:56:46.668 --> 01:56:51.909]  Deep state operators funded by Communist China, the Saudi Arabian money has been cut off.
[01:56:51.909 --> 01:56:56.650]  They're involved in covert operations, killing people, shooting people in the back.
[01:56:56.650 --> 01:56:59.931]  Seth Rich investigators, not just Seth Rich.
[01:56:59.931 --> 01:57:03.432]  So they are getting ready to go violent to try to push us into it.
[01:57:03.432 --> 01:57:08.453]  And you know, thugs always think they're going to win until their heads bounce up and down off the ground.
[01:57:08.453 --> 01:57:10.294]  So I'm not actually, here's the deal.
[01:57:10.294 --> 01:57:11.514]  I don't want to make that call.
[01:57:15.188 --> 01:57:17.429]  Because I'm not sure about it.
[01:57:17.429 --> 01:57:19.549]  But they are pushing us into a position.
[01:57:19.549 --> 01:57:28.072]  But don't worry, long before they've got their actuaries, long before they know our top's gonna blow, they're gonna blow up some federal buildings with daycare centers and blame it on us.
[01:57:28.072 --> 01:57:31.113]  So you're gonna probably get the war you want, son.
[01:57:31.113 --> 01:57:35.294]  So I hope you got your powder dry and you're all rigged up!
[01:57:35.294 --> 01:57:38.115]  Because me, shooting war, that's like, means nothing to me.
[01:57:38.115 --> 01:57:41.136]  That's like, that's like putting my boots on in the morning.
[01:57:41.136 --> 01:57:42.777]  That's like, I know how to do this.
[01:57:42.777 --> 01:57:43.437]  This is easy.
[01:57:47.102 --> 01:57:48.983]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:48.983 --> 01:57:50.224]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.224 --> 01:57:52.165]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:57:52.165 --> 01:58:02.672]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.

[01:59:44.033 --> 01:59:50.734]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:50.734 --> 01:59:53.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:13.424]  We now take you live from the front lines of the resistance.
[02:00:13.424 --> 02:00:21.285]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.285 --> 02:00:28.907]  Alright, we got Steve, Ryan, Mark, Catherine, Carlos, Jason, Caroline, and many others.
[02:00:28.907 --> 02:00:29.927]  Who should we go to first?
[02:00:29.927 --> 02:00:31.227]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:40.262]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark, and we'll go to Catherine after the break.
[02:00:40.262 --> 02:00:40.942]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:00:40.942 --> 02:00:43.383]  Thanks for holding from Pennsylvania.
[02:00:43.383 --> 02:00:44.183]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:44.183 --> 02:00:49.004]  Before I get to my point, yeah, your old video feed isn't going out on YouTube.
[02:00:49.004 --> 02:00:54.705]  The problem's on your end, because I can get other videos off of YouTube.
[02:00:54.705 --> 02:00:55.866]  I've tried different browsers.
[02:00:55.866 --> 02:01:01.947]  But anyway, I just wanted to say, call me as the scum of the earth, a liar.
[02:01:03.711 --> 02:01:12.097]  Yeah, he lied to Congress about leaking stuff to the press.
[02:01:12.097 --> 02:01:16.201]  He didn't bother to tell President Trump that.
[02:01:16.201 --> 02:01:26.148]  The dossier was funded by the DNC, and oh, by the way, he didn't bother to withhold his signature in applying for the FISA warrant.
[02:01:26.148 --> 02:01:28.730]  I mean, I could go on and on, but yeah, this guy just...
[02:01:30.111 --> 02:01:37.520]  He has such a big wire, anything he says so full hold, he'd look like... Well, he covered up Jeffrey Epstein!
[02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:43.412]  Jeff Epstein, he covered up the Lolita Express, the Wiener stuff.
[02:01:43.412 --> 02:01:50.334]  I mean, serious Satanism, serious devil worship, serious stuff, the Democratic Party that's coming out in the news all the time.
[02:01:50.334 --> 02:01:54.455]  And so it's like, oh my gosh, he then says the dossier, well, we don't know if it's real.
[02:01:54.455 --> 02:01:55.936]  Well, they know it's fake.
[02:01:55.936 --> 02:01:57.856]  And then he says, oh yeah, it's so immoral.
[02:01:57.856 --> 02:01:58.997]  The president's so immoral.
[02:01:58.997 --> 02:02:03.618]  You know, if he was having sex with a woman 11 years ago.
[02:02:03.618 --> 02:02:06.919]  See, to them, it's immoral that he's not a pedophile.
[02:02:08.857 --> 02:02:15.183]  Yeah, the only thing that's immoral is standing up to those people.
[02:02:15.183 --> 02:02:18.566]  The only thing that's immoral is going against them.
[02:02:18.566 --> 02:02:23.531]  I mean, the left does have a moral code, but it's not a moral code as you or I would understand it.
[02:02:23.531 --> 02:02:31.899]  Their morality is... Dominating, lying, saying they're the moral authority, hen-pecking you, making you feel bad, running your life.
[02:02:31.899 --> 02:02:33.640]  Because they're weak, they're degenerate, they're scum.
[02:02:34.321 --> 02:02:36.423]  So they have to manipulate those of us that have morals.
[02:02:36.423 --> 02:02:45.132]  They don't have morals, so they seek to dominate the moral lexicon and language to then enslave those that do have morals and are productive.
[02:02:45.132 --> 02:02:46.534]  They can't build anything themselves.
[02:02:47.503 --> 02:02:53.505]  Yeah, but Comey of all people, I mean, that's like the pot calling the kettle black, Alex.
[02:02:53.505 --> 02:02:59.867]  Well, one of those dolls, the ventriloquist dolls that, you know, have the black hair and the eyes like his, what do they call those dolls?
[02:02:59.867 --> 02:03:10.270]  He looks like a seven foot tall version of one of those, and he's such a leaker, such a slimeball, such a liar, such a perjurer, such a dirtbag, such a criminal.
[02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:12.231]  And if the criminals running our government think
[02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:18.432]  At the bureaucratic level, think they're ever going to remove Trump and then themselves politically survive.
[02:03:18.432 --> 02:03:21.052]  They are just such arrogant filth.
[02:03:21.052 --> 02:03:22.393]  You're not invincible.
[02:03:22.393 --> 02:03:23.293]  Your time is over.
[02:03:23.293 --> 02:03:24.113]  God bless you, Mark.
[02:03:24.113 --> 02:03:25.154]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:25.154 --> 02:03:26.874]  Let me just add something.
[02:03:26.874 --> 02:03:32.556]  We send out three or four YouTube streams, three or four Facebook streams, a couple of Periscope feeds.
[02:03:32.556 --> 02:03:36.237]  Our main audience is AM and FM radio and then TV stations.
[02:03:36.237 --> 02:03:39.098]  Even though that's not the future, that's where the big audiences are.
[02:03:39.098 --> 02:03:40.218]  That's where we're at.
[02:03:41.368 --> 02:03:42.670]  And then we're big on the internet, obviously.
[02:03:42.670 --> 02:03:44.111]  They try to censor us there.
[02:03:44.111 --> 02:03:46.334]  And yeah, we got a lot of feeds and a lot of stuff going on.
[02:03:46.334 --> 02:03:55.223]  I want to mount a whole thing on the wall in there, where we can see all our internet feeds, so we can actually monitor that, you know, in amongst... A lot of our crew's amazing and stay so focused.
[02:03:55.223 --> 02:04:02.351]  Other folks all kind of work hard, or they check their phone, and they kind of go talk to somebody, and it's kind of like a frat house or whatever, but we've got a great crew.
[02:04:03.123 --> 02:04:07.614]  That's good when you call us and let us know, you know, that some of that stuff's happening.
[02:04:07.614 --> 02:04:09.659]  And so everybody can understand.
[02:04:09.659 --> 02:04:10.602]  Come on in here, Dave.
[02:04:10.602 --> 02:04:11.303]  Is that YouTube feed up?
[02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:17.452]  Infowars.com for its live show.
[02:04:17.452 --> 02:04:18.914]  And we're going to have a pop-up soon.
[02:04:18.914 --> 02:04:25.160]  I don't know why we never did this, but we're going to have a pop-up that's real nice on the side that's got all the live shows, the feeds, all of it.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.604]  But again, if you go and you see a YouTube feed that's down, go to Infowars.com.
[02:04:29.604 --> 02:04:33.187]  We have our own video feeds, we have our own audio feeds, we have our own podcast.
[02:04:33.187 --> 02:04:36.931]  We get so many calls and emails about the censorship on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:04:36.931 --> 02:04:39.373]  People say, man, they're cutting your feed, they're blocking you, they're not letting me see it.
[02:04:40.314 --> 02:04:50.167]  We're just reaching you there in that controlled gulag, in that controlled little reservation, in that controlled plantation, beaming in saying, hey, you can come here, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:50.167 --> 02:04:52.850]  And our days are numbered, obviously, on all those platforms.
[02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:53.791]  So please, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.246 --> 02:04:59.988]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:04:59.988 --> 02:05:07.032]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:11.795]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:05:11.795 --> 02:05:12.535]  It's very simple.
[02:05:12.535 --> 02:05:15.037]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[02:05:15.037 --> 02:05:16.978]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[02:05:16.978 --> 02:05:18.819]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[02:05:18.819 --> 02:05:19.960]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:20.700]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:05:25.643 --> 02:05:28.684]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:05:28.684 --> 02:05:33.104]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:05:33.104 --> 02:05:36.965]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[02:05:36.965 --> 02:05:40.826]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:05:40.826 --> 02:05:44.007]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:05:44.007 --> 02:05:47.627]  And I want people that haven't tried, brain-forced, to try it and find out why.
[02:05:47.627 --> 02:05:50.228]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[02:05:50.228 --> 02:05:51.248]  It's amazing.
[02:05:51.248 --> 02:05:53.769]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:17.404]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:17.404 --> 02:06:27.387]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:27.387 --> 02:06:29.868]  Scum!
[02:06:29.868 --> 02:06:31.949]  Russian scum!
[02:06:36.630 --> 02:06:43.335]  Reputation's amazing.
[02:06:43.335 --> 02:06:44.817]  I will not let you down.
[02:06:44.817 --> 02:06:47.699]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:06:58.392 --> 02:06:59.333]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:59.333 --> 02:07:01.955]  We're going to take your calls with Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[02:07:01.955 --> 02:07:03.837]  Always interesting, always informative.
[02:07:03.837 --> 02:07:09.121]  Formerly with the State Department, one of the guys that founded Delta Force with General Boykin and Schumacher.
[02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:10.742]  And of course, worked with different agencies.
[02:07:10.742 --> 02:07:11.983]  He's going to ride shotgun with us.
[02:07:11.983 --> 02:07:13.785]  We'll start taking your calls again at the next segment.
[02:07:13.785 --> 02:07:14.845]  I love the angles.
[02:07:14.845 --> 02:07:18.008]  Steve in Pennsylvania wants to talk about Russia and the military industrial complex.
[02:07:18.008 --> 02:07:22.972]  Ryan wants to talk about what we need as a cyber nuke against World War III, whatever that means.
[02:07:22.972 --> 02:07:26.135]  Catherine, why didn't the FBI try to protect Trump from Russia blackmail?
[02:07:26.735 --> 02:07:28.335]  Well, because it's all made up.
[02:07:28.335 --> 02:07:33.577]  Carlos wants to talk about how to discover the areas of the swamp that need to be taken out.
[02:07:33.577 --> 02:07:40.759]  And also, Jason wants to talk about the only option Comey has is the lie, Caroline Comey continued defamation of the press.
[02:07:40.759 --> 02:07:44.220]  But Catherine and Caroline will be up first in the next segment.
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.480]  So much to cover.
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.581]  So much to happen.
[02:07:47.581 --> 02:07:48.661]  So much going on.
[02:07:48.661 --> 02:07:51.842]  But whenever I saw Trump on Wednesday with the tweet about
[02:07:52.819 --> 02:07:53.760]  Our missiles are coming.
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:54.500]  They're so good.
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:55.261]  They're so amazing.
[02:07:55.261 --> 02:07:56.502]  They're so high-tech.
[02:07:56.502 --> 02:08:00.585]  Horrible, you know, murdering animal Assad.
[02:08:00.585 --> 02:08:02.767]  The last three chemical attacks were false flags.
[02:08:02.767 --> 02:08:03.888]  Even our own Pentagon and U.N.
[02:08:03.888 --> 02:08:04.929]  admitted that.
[02:08:04.929 --> 02:08:14.357]  Now as the Russians are pulling out and Trump announces he wants to pull out in countervailance of what the deep state wants, within six days this happens and we're supposed to rush to it.
[02:08:14.357 --> 02:08:20.141]  But then Mattis yesterday came out and said, no, we don't have any evidence it was Assad.
[02:08:21.022 --> 02:08:31.227]  So, this shows the battle going on with the Deep State President John McCain, but because of his brain tumor, more and more the Deep State President is Mueller.
[02:08:31.227 --> 02:08:32.588]  He is their God.
[02:08:32.588 --> 02:08:39.092]  And then you've got the Vice Deep State President, Lyin' Leakin' Comey, perjuring Comey.
[02:08:39.092 --> 02:08:42.934]  So, talk about a wild, wild world of sports.
[02:08:42.934 --> 02:08:47.876]  Dr. Pachinik, where are we as a republic right now with all your great sources on what's going on?
[02:08:47.876 --> 02:08:49.177]  StevePachinik.com is the website.
[02:08:55.506 --> 02:08:57.829]  Hold on Doc, we got an audio problem.
[02:08:57.829 --> 02:08:59.151]  We've got a lot of glitches today.
[02:08:59.151 --> 02:09:03.296]  We're going to try to figure that out and we'll come back to you here in a few minutes.
[02:09:03.296 --> 02:09:04.298]  No problem.
[02:09:04.298 --> 02:09:06.721]  Okay, go ahead Doc, you're on the air now.
[02:09:06.721 --> 02:09:06.841]  Okay.
[02:09:10.526 --> 02:09:16.334]  It's fine because the Republic people are working, the unemployment is low, the economy is going up.
[02:09:16.334 --> 02:09:21.942]  Unfortunately, the stock market is what we call a lead in the newspaper market.
[02:09:21.942 --> 02:09:25.647]  In other words, it's reacting every time to the false news that's coming out.
[02:09:26.267 --> 02:09:34.350]  In terms of Comey, in terms of Mueller, those people will either be fired or they eventually become irrelevant.
[02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:44.894]  What is wonderful about what happened, including all of the people on your show and otherwise, is that Mattis and others came forth and said, look, this is a false flag.
[02:09:44.894 --> 02:09:50.536]  We've had British, American and French troops in Syria for quite a while.
[02:09:51.156 --> 02:09:55.160]  We did have an interchange between the Russians and the Americans.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.521]  Some were hurt.
[02:09:56.521 --> 02:10:06.770]  The issue about Djibouti, where the planes were crashing, was really a cover-up for, unfortunately, brave warriors who died in Syria.
[02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:09.913]  We're not interested in going into war thanks to Mattis.
[02:10:10.333 --> 02:10:15.819]  Who understands very well that war is not the solution for this, as does Trump.
[02:10:15.819 --> 02:10:28.992]  Trump is really just twittering all of the aspects in terms of the fact that he's threatening and putting a position in where he's putting Putin and he's putting the Mullahs on notice.
[02:10:28.992 --> 02:10:31.494]  But is he in fact going to go into war?
[02:10:31.494 --> 02:10:32.155]  I think not.
[02:10:32.595 --> 02:10:44.748]  Ironically, with John Bolton there, who you would think would promote war, I think he has become somewhat more acquiescent to the demands of a greater general like Mattis.
[02:10:45.407 --> 02:10:49.550]  Mattis knows exactly what generals have to do in order to go to war.
[02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:52.952]  They know very well that war is not the solution.
[02:10:52.952 --> 02:11:02.758]  And when you have a false flag, which was initiated by the Israelis, once again, this is the way a dependent country, which acts like a teenager for the most part,
[02:11:03.178 --> 02:11:03.278]  Yes.
[02:11:19.261 --> 02:11:20.602]  We're good to go.
[02:11:35.054 --> 02:11:37.776]  Just like on DACA or just like on the guns.
[02:11:37.776 --> 02:11:40.658]  He says one thing to get the Hawks off his back.
[02:11:40.658 --> 02:11:48.625]  I think Putin knew that was, you know, cartoonish on purpose, but then had no intention of actually striking Russian forces again that could lead us to World War III.
[02:11:48.625 --> 02:11:59.113]  But again, the boldness of the deep state stay-behinds, you know, telling Trump shut his mouth like Brennan did the first week Trump was in the White House.
[02:11:59.113 --> 02:12:00.394]  Couldn't believe Trump fired him.
[02:12:00.394 --> 02:12:02.776]  I mean, what is going on with Brennan and Clapper?
[02:12:02.776 --> 02:12:04.177]  They seem completely delusional.
[02:12:05.106 --> 02:12:06.426]  Well, they're not delusional.
[02:12:06.426 --> 02:12:10.027]  It's exactly what you and I talked about 13, 14 years ago.
[02:12:10.027 --> 02:12:11.647]  I have no respect for Brennan.
[02:12:11.647 --> 02:12:16.828]  Brennan is one of the most pathetic, incompetent, corrupt DCIs.
[02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:20.089]  He did not start as a DDO, a covert operative.
[02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:23.349]  Instead, he sucked his way up to the political system.
[02:12:23.349 --> 02:12:27.070]  He may have converted to Islam and was a disaster.
[02:12:27.070 --> 02:12:32.111]  The reason he could come up with the system of the CIA is that nobody stopped him.
[02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:32.491]  He was an
[02:12:32.791 --> 02:12:35.092]  Absolute disaster in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:35.092 --> 02:12:39.134]  He was a disaster under the Bush and Clinton administration.
[02:12:39.134 --> 02:12:41.555]  He should be put in prison.
[02:12:41.555 --> 02:12:43.135]  I've said it for a long time.
[02:12:43.135 --> 02:12:46.577]  Hayden is the same way and so is the other one.
[02:12:46.577 --> 02:12:47.337]  So let's explain it.
[02:12:47.337 --> 02:12:56.221]  They're a bunch of lip-wristed fraud sycophants that can't even tie their shoelaces and have never done anything for the country but have been put in there because they're political traitors.
[02:12:56.994 --> 02:12:59.155]  Correct, but they're not limp-wristed.
[02:12:59.155 --> 02:13:00.755]  These are real criminals.
[02:13:00.755 --> 02:13:08.098]  This is where you need to have an FBI director and an attorney general that is not Mueller, that is not Comey.
[02:13:08.098 --> 02:13:10.879]  So you're saying they have real criminal energy?
[02:13:10.879 --> 02:13:11.899]  This is criminal.
[02:13:11.899 --> 02:13:15.540]  There's no question that Brennan is a crime criminal.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:17.721]  He initiated 9-11.
[02:13:17.721 --> 02:13:19.962]  He worked with Bush on 9-11.
[02:13:19.962 --> 02:13:22.243]  He worked with Cheney on 9-11.
[02:13:22.243 --> 02:13:24.443]  He worked with Worms on 9-11.
[02:13:24.443 --> 02:13:26.484]  There's no question this man's an idiot.
[02:13:27.182 --> 02:13:34.205]  I've known him, I've known all about him for years to come, and the CIA should have thrown him out a long time ago.
[02:13:34.205 --> 02:13:41.728]  And when you talk to those generals, when we had you on, you know, right after 9-11, back when you were on the Council on Foreign Relations, of course you co-wrote Clancy's books for us to know who you are.
[02:13:41.728 --> 02:13:46.110]  I mean, the generals are all very open about the stand-down all over the 28 pages.
[02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:48.631]  We knew about that 16, 17 years ago.
[02:13:48.631 --> 02:13:49.911]  We've been vindicated.
[02:13:49.911 --> 02:13:54.293]  And so I guess our military's been simmering under the surface, really upset about this for a while.
[02:13:55.222 --> 02:13:57.563]  Well, I know you don't like to hear what I'm about to say.
[02:13:57.563 --> 02:14:02.844]  Thanks to you and your audience, our military has been simmering since about 2002 and 2003.
[02:14:02.844 --> 02:14:20.150]  There have been incredible generals, including General Boykin, Keith Alexander, and a whole group of them, who began to understand that they were being coerced or usurped by these neocon cowards who are basically... Who are actually going to double-cross us with radical Islam in the final game, and it's incredible.
[02:14:21.067 --> 02:14:22.487]  It's exactly what happened.
[02:14:22.487 --> 02:14:29.369]  Saudi Arabia, Israel, now are involved in the same false flag that they were involved in 9-11.
[02:14:29.369 --> 02:14:39.892]  Instead of punishing Israel, getting rid of Bibi and bringing in a moderate, the Israeli people have done absolutely nothing but allowed their boys to die for nothing.
[02:14:39.892 --> 02:14:46.294]  Well, I want to be clear, and I know you're a part Jewish and your family died in the Holocaust and all of it, so you can specifically speak to this.
[02:14:46.294 --> 02:14:47.494]  I know you got your history.
[02:14:48.254 --> 02:14:49.595]  The whole thing is clear though.
[02:14:49.595 --> 02:14:55.440]  Even the Russian ambassador to the EU, Russian ambassador to the UN, both said this is a false flag.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.302]  Coalition forces in there trained them.
[02:14:57.302 --> 02:15:04.628]  But the Allah Akbar crowd that Saudi Arabia the first time gave the chemical mortars to, they want to be rock stars and get the millions of dollars for launching the attack.
[02:15:04.628 --> 02:15:06.830]  They videotaped it and Allah Akbar'd it.
[02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:09.572]  So the reason we know they staged it is they're so out of control.
[02:15:10.453 --> 02:15:12.915]  The Islamists don't even cover up they're doing it.
[02:15:12.915 --> 02:15:16.338]  So I'm not defending Israel, but I haven't been sure who was behind it.
[02:15:16.338 --> 02:15:19.841]  We just know it's a false flag because of motive and history and past action.
[02:15:19.841 --> 02:15:21.443]  I know you have great connections.
[02:15:21.443 --> 02:15:22.123]  We're going to go to break.
[02:15:22.123 --> 02:15:26.507]  When we come back, tell us who's telling you, Dr. Steve Pachenik, that it was Israel did this.
[02:15:27.927 --> 02:15:30.428]  Israel's been meeting with the new prince and his whole PR campaign.
[02:15:30.428 --> 02:15:35.790]  They've been very close with these secret meetings, and I know Saudi Arabia doesn't want... It's Israel that told me.
[02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:40.392]  Israel's behavior is so consistent, you can't avoid it.
[02:15:40.392 --> 02:15:42.112]  It was predictable.
[02:15:42.112 --> 02:15:42.452]  Well, sure.
[02:15:42.452 --> 02:15:45.894]  In fact, guys, print me that zero ahead, six reasons Trump they think may hit Syria.
[02:15:45.894 --> 02:15:49.175]  Because, I mean, it is true, Israel has an old beef with Syria.
[02:15:49.175 --> 02:15:50.955]  And so, yeah, this is something we have to look at.
[02:15:50.955 --> 02:15:52.416]  We'll be right back with your phone calls as well.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.521]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:57.521 --> 02:16:02.822]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:16:02.822 --> 02:16:04.422]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:12.764]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:18.466]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:16:18.626 --> 02:16:20.447]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:16:20.447 --> 02:16:22.708]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:16:22.708 --> 02:16:27.131]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:16:27.131 --> 02:16:29.312]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:16:55.611 --> 02:16:58.472]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[02:16:58.472 --> 02:17:05.737]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days, or even decades in the most dire scenarios.

[02:17:28.623 --> 02:17:31.324]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:17:31.324 --> 02:17:36.645]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:17:36.645 --> 02:17:42.326]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:17:42.326 --> 02:17:45.767]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:17:45.767 --> 02:17:48.888]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[02:18:07.985 --> 02:18:18.273]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:18:18.633 --> 02:18:26.458]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:18:26.458 --> 02:18:36.665]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:18:36.665 --> 02:18:38.706]  And this part is most important.

[02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:53.054]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:18:53.054 --> 02:18:54.355]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:19:08.683 --> 02:19:11.544]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.544 --> 02:19:13.045]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.045 --> 02:19:19.868]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.868 --> 02:19:21.949]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.949 --> 02:19:31.653]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.653 --> 02:19:36.655]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[02:19:36.755 --> 02:19:48.463]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.463 --> 02:19:51.765]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.765 --> 02:19:59.770]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Field and Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:02.412]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.284 --> 02:20:24.168]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:43.941]  Gosh, it's got to be 17 years, 16, 17 years.
[02:20:43.941 --> 02:20:53.305]  I read like a Council on Foreign Relations transcript, so he was telling them they were all idiots, and that 9-11 was a pretext to start all these wars, it was going to blow up in their face.
[02:20:53.305 --> 02:20:58.687]  But now we sit here and we see radical Islam openly allied with the left and the globalists to flood Europe.
[02:20:58.687 --> 02:21:03.909]  I want to ask him what the plan is with that, but we got cut off by the break when he was getting to a very, very important point.
[02:21:03.909 --> 02:21:05.050]  Let's go back to that.
[02:21:07.646 --> 02:21:10.670]  Alex, basically what happens is very simple.
[02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:14.374]  I spent three weeks in Syria before the war broke out.
[02:21:14.374 --> 02:21:18.739]  I got to meet all the military people, the intelligence as well.
[02:21:18.739 --> 02:21:21.241]  They're not interested in a war with Israel.
[02:21:21.241 --> 02:21:22.222]  That's not their interest.
[02:21:22.222 --> 02:21:23.304]  And you've been there before.
[02:21:23.304 --> 02:21:25.246]  You were actually locked up by Assad's dad.
[02:21:26.072 --> 02:21:26.732]  That's correct.
[02:21:26.732 --> 02:21:27.893]  I had no protection.
[02:21:27.893 --> 02:21:30.794]  They took me around for 17, 18 days.
[02:21:30.794 --> 02:21:33.716]  Went to Latakia, Palmyra, Homs, Hamas.
[02:21:33.716 --> 02:21:37.458]  But I could see in Homs and Hamas that they were Sunni Muslim.
[02:21:37.458 --> 02:21:39.839]  You have a country that's ruled by Alawite.
[02:21:39.839 --> 02:21:42.140]  Alawite are minority Muslims.
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:44.121]  They're almost what we call light Muslims.
[02:21:44.121 --> 02:21:49.144]  And Bashar Assad, his father and his brothers... Aren't they really just sheep-dipped Christians?
[02:21:49.144 --> 02:21:50.985]  Like, they had to convert to Islam, but they're really not?
[02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.432]  Well, you know, I don't want to get into it.
[02:21:54.432 --> 02:21:58.534]  It's a form of Shiite Islam, but a very light form.
[02:21:58.534 --> 02:22:01.016]  And the French brought them in in the 1920s.
[02:22:01.016 --> 02:22:06.299]  They were located in the mountains, so they brought them to a beautiful area on the Mediterranean, Latakia.
[02:22:06.299 --> 02:22:09.742]  So Macron knows the history of this country very well.
[02:22:09.742 --> 02:22:10.922]  The French know it.
[02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:14.064]  They know that Assad does not want to go to war.
[02:22:14.064 --> 02:22:16.826]  The problem is... So aren't they basically like mystics?
[02:22:16.826 --> 02:22:18.567]  I mean, that particular group is more like mystics?
[02:22:19.508 --> 02:22:22.176]  That would be a little bit more like the Sufi Muslim.
[02:22:22.176 --> 02:22:22.777]  Sufi, yeah.
[02:22:23.797 --> 02:22:28.539]  Those are the ones who are like, they will swirl around and they will kind of get lightheaded.
[02:22:28.539 --> 02:22:33.501]  And they're not ardent Muslims as much as they are metaphysicists.
[02:22:33.501 --> 02:22:37.222]  And our whites are really very compassionate.
[02:22:37.222 --> 02:22:42.584]  Bashar takes care of the Jews, the Druze, the Christians, everyone else.
[02:22:42.584 --> 02:22:43.565]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:22:43.565 --> 02:22:46.226]  Nobody understands that he is an ophthalmologist.
[02:22:46.226 --> 02:22:48.166]  He really isn't looking for trouble.
[02:22:48.166 --> 02:22:52.428]  When he wanted to stay in power, and I warn the Council on Foreign Relations, particularly
[02:22:52.768 --> 02:23:00.610]  These immature, ignorant CIA operatives do not go into Syria.
[02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:11.313]  And of course it was Hillary Clinton, it was the entire Obama administration went in without knowing exactly what... Their attempt to have an Arab Spring, bring it down and give it to the jihadis blew up in their face.
[02:23:11.313 --> 02:23:12.713]  Now the Russians are pulling out.
[02:23:12.713 --> 02:23:18.395]  Why in Hades would the Russians or Assad, when they're winning, stage a chemical attack on civilians?
[02:23:18.395 --> 02:23:19.375]  That's the dumbest thing ever.
[02:23:20.175 --> 02:23:21.597]  No, and that's the point.
[02:23:21.597 --> 02:23:23.859]  And also I spent time in the Soviet Union.
[02:23:23.859 --> 02:23:25.080]  I did a regime change.
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:29.484]  But I also knew when Putin came in, the own KGB didn't know who Putin was.
[02:23:29.484 --> 02:23:30.464]  I explained it to them.
[02:23:30.464 --> 02:23:32.887]  He was an East German intelligence officer.
[02:23:32.887 --> 02:23:34.188]  He's very smart.
[02:23:34.188 --> 02:23:36.950]  He knows exactly how the agency works.
[02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:41.354]  He knows exactly the tactical and strategic elements of covert operation.
[02:23:41.354 --> 02:23:42.295]  He doesn't need this.
[02:23:42.295 --> 02:23:43.236]  They already had
[02:23:43.996 --> 02:23:49.881]  Basically taken out in exchange of some of our special forces who unfortunately were killed.
[02:23:49.881 --> 02:23:53.183]  And that was covered by the issue of Djibouti Airlines.
[02:23:53.183 --> 02:23:56.085]  Our airplanes were shot down in Djibouti.
[02:23:56.085 --> 02:23:57.146]  That's not correct.
[02:23:57.146 --> 02:23:59.428]  The soldiers who were killed were brave warriors.
[02:23:59.952 --> 02:24:01.892]  In the units in Syria.
[02:24:01.892 --> 02:24:12.774]  And then the person I think who was involved in the exchange would be Senator Duckworth, who was a brave heroine, still is, who lost her legs in the Iraq War.
[02:24:12.774 --> 02:24:17.315]  And I think she negotiated the release of our American Special Forces.
[02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:23.176]  In turn, the British were taken out, the Israeli pulled back, and the French have just stayed there.
[02:24:23.176 --> 02:24:27.617]  You're giving a whole history, but getting past that, we need to get the calls on a bunch of the big issues.
[02:24:29.016 --> 02:24:33.258]  The Deep State is full-on raiding Trump Tower over a woman 11 years ago.
[02:24:33.258 --> 02:24:34.379]  Complete mission creep.
[02:24:34.379 --> 02:24:35.159]  Totally illegal.
[02:24:35.159 --> 02:24:37.480]  All the lawyers, all the experts agree.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:38.360]  They're cornered rats.
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:39.221]  They're totally rogue.
[02:24:39.221 --> 02:24:40.441]  This is dangerous.
[02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:48.785]  And I don't know how, under the Constitution, you name it, when the Communist Chinese and others are openly the only group funding the Democrats right now, from my information.
[02:24:48.785 --> 02:24:53.467]  Trump's cut off the Saudi funding, got them to, you know, at least partially, reform.
[02:24:53.467 --> 02:24:54.808]  What is going on with Trump right now?
[02:24:54.808 --> 02:24:57.049]  I mean, how much of this can be put up with?
[02:24:58.092 --> 02:24:59.593]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:24:59.593 --> 02:25:08.401]  From my perspective, I think Trump is having a massive amount of input that he has to filter out very quickly.
[02:25:08.401 --> 02:25:12.244]  But there's one element about Trump that most people don't understand.
[02:25:12.244 --> 02:25:15.807]  The one thing Trump loves more than anything else is action.
[02:25:16.568 --> 02:25:29.501]  By the way, what you say from people I know about Trump, that's exactly it.
[02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:32.144]  He is super bored with just regular things.
[02:25:32.144 --> 02:25:33.806]  He likes super high-tension deals.
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:43.169]  He's a businessman, and what he's doing now, he loves the input that's coming in from China, Russia, from Syria, from his military officers.
[02:25:43.169 --> 02:25:47.073]  And what he's going to do is the same thing he did in the business world.
[02:25:47.073 --> 02:25:53.760]  He's going to give to those people whom he trusts, and particularly Mattis, you make the decision what we're going to do.
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.381]  In the meantime, I will Twitter.
[02:25:55.381 --> 02:25:56.743]  Whatever it is, I will Twitter.
[02:25:57.083 --> 02:25:57.183]  Yes.
[02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:27.364]  They don't even read their enemy's own treatise, his whole worldview, because they're only one-dimensional about right now trying to score a point.
[02:26:27.364 --> 02:26:29.046]  They don't get how they're playing into it.
[02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:31.270]  Why is the modern left so stupid?
[02:26:32.182 --> 02:26:33.764]  Because they're arrogant.
[02:26:33.764 --> 02:26:36.787]  Arrogance leads to ignorance and self-destruction.
[02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:39.850]  I've seen this repeatedly, one after another.
[02:26:39.850 --> 02:26:41.612]  They don't learn their history.
[02:26:41.612 --> 02:26:55.186]  The one thing we Republicans have always done, we've concentrated on foreign policy, what our history is, what it was, and even the people at the University of Chicago who were conservatives knew that December 7th was a false flag.
[02:26:55.646 --> 02:26:56.948]  Well, they let it happen, yeah.
[02:26:56.948 --> 02:26:58.450]  But let me ask you this, we gotta go to a break of the calls.
[02:26:58.450 --> 02:27:02.055]  I promise I'm gonna go right to Catherine and Caroline when we come back, I promise.
[02:27:02.055 --> 02:27:06.060]  Briefly, I'm not whining, but you talked to your sources when they had us kicked off YouTube.
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:09.825]  You said it's a coup d'etat inside there, it's a mutiny, it's gonna be cleaned up in a few days.
[02:27:09.825 --> 02:27:12.528]  Geospatial Center runs it, NSA, which everybody knows.
[02:27:13.209 --> 02:27:14.911]  I tell reporters that they think I'm crazy.
[02:27:14.911 --> 02:27:15.872]  That's just a fact.
[02:27:15.872 --> 02:27:17.353]  It's in mainstream news.
[02:27:17.353 --> 02:27:19.015]  And sure enough, it's taken them a month.
[02:27:19.015 --> 02:27:21.197]  They've turned everybody's channel back on.
[02:27:21.197 --> 02:27:22.578]  They had to go through it all.
[02:27:22.578 --> 02:27:23.659]  It's happened.
[02:27:23.659 --> 02:27:28.603]  So what's happening now with like this 15 lawsuits I'm under, which my lawyers admit are all fake.
[02:27:28.603 --> 02:27:31.226]  We're getting them overturned every week, but they just file more.
[02:27:31.226 --> 02:27:34.008]  They've got big ones I'm going to break that are going to be filed next week.
[02:27:34.008 --> 02:27:35.109]  I'll break it before they break them.
[02:27:35.109 --> 02:27:36.451]  I want people to know about this.
[02:27:36.451 --> 02:27:37.572]  What is this tactic?
[02:27:38.305 --> 02:27:40.086]  Basically, they're harassing you.
[02:27:40.086 --> 02:27:42.948]  There's no way they can come in on you legitimately.
[02:27:42.948 --> 02:27:46.110]  Your lawyers will tell you there's no cause of action.
[02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:50.333]  The basic problem was that they wanted to take you down and they tried it.
[02:27:50.333 --> 02:27:51.153]  Then what happened?
[02:27:51.153 --> 02:27:53.475]  Zuckerberg got called into Congress.
[02:27:53.475 --> 02:27:54.255]  Then what happened?
[02:27:54.255 --> 02:27:56.677]  YouTube was told to cease and desist.
[02:27:57.197 --> 02:27:58.198]  So is Google.
[02:27:58.198 --> 02:28:00.279]  And suddenly I got monetized.
[02:28:00.279 --> 02:28:01.000]  So will you.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.322]  And I said to you, you will remain on the air.
[02:28:04.322 --> 02:28:06.663]  Whatever else they want to do, that's harassment.
[02:28:06.663 --> 02:28:09.345]  From my point of view, you're going to remain on.
[02:28:09.345 --> 02:28:18.291]  I just want you to take it easy because this is part of the game that occurs when the left and the attackers have no more options.
[02:28:18.291 --> 02:28:21.573]  They're basically scattering all over the field.
[02:28:21.573 --> 02:28:22.334]  They have nothing else.
[02:28:22.334 --> 02:28:23.575]  You're talking about death throes.
[02:28:23.575 --> 02:28:24.776]  And we're not just saying that.
[02:28:24.776 --> 02:28:26.857]  These are flailing death throes.
[02:28:27.577 --> 02:28:28.358]  That's correct.
[02:28:28.358 --> 02:28:37.642]  You're seeing the entity die and they're trying to resuscitate through the midterms and bringing in other, you know, Democrats.
[02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:42.845]  But basically, the Ryans and others who should never have been there in the first place really are leaving.
[02:28:42.845 --> 02:28:43.765]  That's another question.
[02:28:43.765 --> 02:28:46.286]  Why is Ryan evacuating from your intel, Dr. Sipocinic?
[02:28:46.286 --> 02:28:48.227]  And then, I got a new phone system.
[02:28:48.227 --> 02:28:48.847]  It's crashing.
[02:28:48.847 --> 02:28:50.228]  It's intermittent internet service.
[02:28:50.228 --> 02:28:51.829]  I'm calling an outside group in.
[02:28:51.829 --> 02:28:53.750]  I'm gonna go pull those old switches out of the wall myself.
[02:28:55.299 --> 02:28:56.020]  Face it.
[02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:58.881]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[02:28:58.881 --> 02:29:06.146]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days, or even decades in the most dire scenarios.

[02:29:26.702 --> 02:29:32.087]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:29:32.087 --> 02:29:34.989]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[02:33:20.314 --> 02:33:25.201]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.201 --> 02:33:27.324]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.324 --> 02:33:29.106]  Alright, and again we got a new phone system.
[02:33:29.106 --> 02:33:31.249]  They're just tweaking it so it's been up and down today.
[02:33:31.249 --> 02:33:32.250]  Crew's doing a great job.
[02:33:32.250 --> 02:33:32.851]  I actually went in there.
[02:33:32.851 --> 02:33:33.672]  It's all new switches.
[02:33:33.672 --> 02:33:34.934]  I wanted some of these old switches gone.
[02:33:34.934 --> 02:33:36.156]  I actually went in the control room.
[02:33:36.156 --> 02:33:37.497]  It's all new phone system in it.
[02:33:38.138 --> 02:33:38.918]  It's having problems.
[02:33:38.918 --> 02:33:41.340]  I thought somebody might have jacked into it or hacked it.
[02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:42.180]  That goes on around here.
[02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:46.302]  But it was actually one of the... Joel Gilbert coming up uses it for his audio connection.
[02:33:46.302 --> 02:33:47.382]  So it's a backup.
[02:33:47.382 --> 02:33:48.583]  So he was logging in.
[02:33:48.583 --> 02:33:51.124]  So they saw that on the computer while the system was going down.
[02:33:51.124 --> 02:33:53.465]  So we had to change the password and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:33:53.465 --> 02:33:54.826]  So that's going on here.
[02:33:54.826 --> 02:33:56.147]  But if you can call back in, we'll go to you.
[02:33:56.147 --> 02:33:56.807]  I apologize.
[02:33:56.807 --> 02:33:57.467]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:33:57.467 --> 02:33:57.507]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:04.261]  I've just been getting ready to go to your calls twice, had the phone system go down.
[02:34:04.261 --> 02:34:06.462]  It usually goes down like twice every, you know, six months.
[02:34:06.462 --> 02:34:07.883]  It can be four times a year.
[02:34:07.883 --> 02:34:08.603]  It's going down a lot.
[02:34:08.603 --> 02:34:10.404]  We're going to fix it.
[02:34:10.404 --> 02:34:16.326]  Now, the crew was like, this is great radio, really informative, but you didn't get back to Israel last segment.
[02:34:16.326 --> 02:34:19.188]  Get back to Israel on the false flag.
[02:34:19.188 --> 02:34:22.049]  And so Pchenik was going to get more into that, but just briefly getting into me.
[02:34:23.191 --> 02:34:30.737]  And getting into Infowars, because yeah, we reach 30-40 million people a week during big peak times, 50-60 million, sometimes more than that.
[02:34:30.737 --> 02:34:35.081]  They saw right before the election and in the election, Paul Watson was the real star.
[02:34:35.081 --> 02:34:38.544]  He had videos every week with over 20 million views apiece.
[02:34:38.544 --> 02:34:44.549]  I mean, there were some videos with 37 million views, and then that was in one week, and that would be at 200 million now.
[02:34:44.549 --> 02:34:46.471]  Once you hit above 20 million, they just keep climbing.
[02:34:47.395 --> 02:34:49.496]  And Facebook and YouTube just deleted them all.
[02:34:49.496 --> 02:34:50.337]  They don't even give us notice.
[02:34:50.337 --> 02:34:51.857]  They just go in and bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[02:34:51.857 --> 02:34:53.418]  All these videos are gone.
[02:34:53.418 --> 02:34:58.381]  And so now we're shadow banned down to, if you're only on the Facebook or YouTube, if you're on the page, you can see it.
[02:34:58.381 --> 02:35:02.122]  And it's still millions of people a day, and we're on hundreds of radio stations and TV.
[02:35:02.122 --> 02:35:04.844]  So we're still reaching a lot of people, but they've strangled it a bit.
[02:35:04.844 --> 02:35:05.724]  But it seeps out.
[02:35:05.724 --> 02:35:06.745]  It's the Streisand effect.
[02:35:06.745 --> 02:35:08.686]  But we're not that good.
[02:35:09.466 --> 02:35:13.469]  I mean, maybe they see us as a weak target, so they think it's a good poster child.
[02:35:13.469 --> 02:35:18.472]  They thought that with Trump, like, use Alex Jones' connection to Trump to make Trump look bad.
[02:35:18.472 --> 02:35:21.815]  But I talked to the campaign and others, that ended up giving him a mystique.
[02:35:21.815 --> 02:35:23.336]  People want anti-establishment.
[02:35:23.336 --> 02:35:26.918]  So, we're talking 10 different TV shows a week attacking me.
[02:35:26.918 --> 02:35:35.464]  I mean, shows all about the show, Comedy Central shows where they steal our identity, say they're with us, and then say horrible things in our name.
[02:35:35.464 --> 02:35:36.365]  Super Deception.
[02:35:37.458 --> 02:35:45.338]  You know, the show Homeland, all this stuff, it goes on and on, and it's a total obsession by these idiots, and they don't even get...
[02:35:46.906 --> 02:35:55.313]  There are now hundreds of channels I know of, that I can't even keep track of, that are suddenly getting 3, 4, 5 million views, all basically saying the same thing we're saying.
[02:35:55.313 --> 02:36:09.544]  So, all this attention to censorship, to me, just eyeballing it, looks like it blew up in their face worse, and even in their fake polls, Trump's even up more, and nationalists are winning everywhere, and populism's coming back, and the EU admits it's about to collapse.
[02:36:10.583 --> 02:36:11.804]  What's happened here?
[02:36:11.804 --> 02:36:13.665]  And why are they so obsessed with InfoWars?
[02:36:13.665 --> 02:36:15.486]  Is it because you come on or others come on?
[02:36:15.486 --> 02:36:19.109]  Because to me, I don't think it's that big a deal.
[02:36:19.109 --> 02:36:20.690]  Well, you are a big deal.
[02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:21.891]  The issue isn't that.
[02:36:21.891 --> 02:36:24.653]  You didn't start out with your grandiosity.
[02:36:24.653 --> 02:36:26.674]  You started out with the notion that, look,
[02:36:27.353 --> 02:36:33.719]  I'm going to say whatever I'm going to say, and I'm going to say it my way, not the New York Times way, not the New York Post.
[02:36:33.719 --> 02:36:35.640]  My way is Alex Jones way.
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:38.583]  The two combination of a paradigm shift.
[02:36:38.583 --> 02:36:41.105]  You've got to understand what it is that we're doing.
[02:36:41.105 --> 02:36:50.954]  We have literally broken the narrative of the newspaper, the narrative of the three articles on the one subject.
[02:36:50.954 --> 02:36:51.935]  They don't know what to say.
[02:36:52.495 --> 02:36:56.701]  And you basically came in and said, look, I don't believe any of this.
[02:36:56.701 --> 02:36:58.584]  This is how I'm going to work it.
[02:36:58.584 --> 02:37:00.207]  I'm going to be spontaneous.
[02:37:00.207 --> 02:37:06.456]  I'm going to start riffing in my own mind, whatever words come to mind, and also be amusing about it.
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:10.104]  That was not conceivable.
[02:37:10.104 --> 02:37:11.986]  No one in the press could understand.
[02:37:11.986 --> 02:37:21.516]  And by the way, even Colbert two weeks ago kind of slipped up and he goes with his guest, he goes, Infowars is so bad because it's creating new narratives and they both look scared.
[02:37:21.516 --> 02:37:22.518]  What are they scared of?
[02:37:22.518 --> 02:37:24.179]  These people are, you know what it is?
[02:37:24.179 --> 02:37:25.821]  They don't get to be their own men.
[02:37:25.821 --> 02:37:26.862]  They're told what to say.
[02:37:27.702 --> 02:37:34.966]  Remember, when you're not your own man and you have your own business, this is why you attract and I attract entrepreneurs.
[02:37:34.966 --> 02:37:36.767]  We're not beholden to anybody.
[02:37:36.767 --> 02:37:38.748]  We're just beholden to ourselves.
[02:37:38.748 --> 02:37:39.988]  We make the mistakes.
[02:37:39.988 --> 02:37:40.689]  We fail.
[02:37:40.689 --> 02:37:46.171]  When you get a guy who's Colbert, comes out of the Stewart Show or whatever, he's not really that funny.
[02:37:46.171 --> 02:37:47.172]  He thinks he's funny.
[02:37:47.592 --> 02:37:50.013]  And basically, he doesn't know what to say.
[02:37:50.013 --> 02:37:54.495]  He's paid $6 million to stand up there like a puppet to say what?
[02:37:54.495 --> 02:37:56.075]  Nobody's interested.
[02:37:56.075 --> 02:38:00.897]  Instead, we had a paradigm shift with a guy named Alex Jones from where?
[02:38:00.897 --> 02:38:01.857]  Austin, Texas.
[02:38:01.857 --> 02:38:03.418]  Well, Austin isn't New York.
[02:38:03.878 --> 02:38:05.759]  Austin is in Los Angeles.
[02:38:05.759 --> 02:38:07.099]  Austin is in Chicago.
[02:38:07.099 --> 02:38:09.540]  What in God's name is in Austin, Texas?
[02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:15.001]  So we have a different person, a different personality, a different format, a different location.
[02:38:15.001 --> 02:38:17.122]  Then you get a guy, his name is what?
[02:38:17.122 --> 02:38:18.422]  Dr. Steve who?
[02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.422]  Pijanek?
[02:38:19.422 --> 02:38:19.903]  He what?
[02:38:19.903 --> 02:38:26.745]  He left the Council on Foreign Relations because he was against the war in Syria and Iran and Iraq.
[02:38:26.745 --> 02:38:27.805]  I never heard of that.
[02:38:27.805 --> 02:38:30.486]  He was an anointed person and then he left.
[02:38:30.486 --> 02:38:31.506]  And he's joining who?
[02:38:32.086 --> 02:38:34.627]  Alex Jones and he's saying what?
[02:38:34.627 --> 02:38:41.169]  All of those elements combined created a combustion that basically the system can't contain.
[02:38:41.169 --> 02:38:44.110]  They don't understand it and to this day they still don't understand it.
[02:38:44.110 --> 02:38:49.792]  And they don't get that what you and I and many others did, we already detonated and now the shockwaves are going out.
[02:38:49.792 --> 02:38:51.393]  We already sunk to the bottom.
[02:38:51.393 --> 02:38:54.314]  Even if they take us out, we already blew their operation.
[02:38:54.314 --> 02:38:55.234]  They don't get it.
[02:38:55.234 --> 02:38:58.295]  They think they can go back and attack the source of the detonation.
[02:38:59.801 --> 02:39:04.202]  They can't get it because, as you said, we've already been decapitated.
[02:39:04.202 --> 02:39:05.302]  We've come back.
[02:39:05.302 --> 02:39:08.803]  We said to them, if you pull this stuff again, we'll decapitate you.
[02:39:08.803 --> 02:39:10.223]  And by the way, they did.
[02:39:10.223 --> 02:39:13.144]  I'm sorry the lady had to kill people at YouTube.
[02:39:13.144 --> 02:39:19.045]  But basically, that was the expression of frustration that was coming out against Google and YouTube.
[02:39:19.045 --> 02:39:24.046]  And when I warned the Soviet Jewish boy who I took out of the Soviet Union, Bray,
[02:39:24.506 --> 02:39:28.692]  And he started to create his own gulag on YouTube and Google.
[02:39:28.692 --> 02:39:30.274]  That was a warning to him.
[02:39:30.274 --> 02:39:32.096]  And ironically... By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:39:32.096 --> 02:39:37.663]  You said days before Bloomberg broke that there was a mutiny inside YouTube and Google and they were going to fix it.
[02:39:37.663 --> 02:39:37.963]  Everything.
[02:39:37.963 --> 02:39:40.767]  You said that you knew that from the Geospatial Center.
[02:39:40.767 --> 02:39:43.069]  Tell us as much specifics as you can because that's big.
[02:39:44.073 --> 02:39:48.215]  Well, I don't want to get into the National Geospatial Agency.
[02:39:48.215 --> 02:39:51.317]  All I can tell you is one of our newest intelligence outfits.
[02:39:51.317 --> 02:39:55.579]  It's a brilliant collection of individuals from all over the world.
[02:39:55.579 --> 02:40:00.081]  These are the guys who, and women by the way, it was headed by a woman.
[02:40:00.081 --> 02:40:05.483]  Sure, but you said they're being told right now they're not going to turn Google into a gulag.
[02:40:06.724 --> 02:40:14.487]  Yeah, and the reason for that is there was a gentleman by the name of Keith Alexander, General Keith Alexander, whom I worked with.
[02:40:14.487 --> 02:40:17.688]  Well, he was in G2, but he was head of the NSA.
[02:40:17.688 --> 02:40:28.933]  Now he has his own private consulting, but he asked the question that the National Geospatial Agency really had to answer in entity, and that was, what is the third dimension of the Internet?
[02:40:29.253 --> 02:40:36.519]  We know the ones, the zeros, but what is life within the Internet, in its depth and horizontal levels?
[02:40:36.519 --> 02:40:37.280]  It's deep.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:38.441]  How deep does it go?
[02:40:38.441 --> 02:40:39.722]  How far does it go?
[02:40:39.722 --> 02:40:43.746]  And a whole institution was created to answer that third question.
[02:40:43.746 --> 02:40:54.395]  Well, it's an interface into human activity in the future, and so it's actually a nexus into the third dimension, and above that, it's a giant brain-melting machine.
[02:40:55.228 --> 02:40:56.308]  Now you got it.
[02:40:56.308 --> 02:41:03.371]  Now we not only have the internet, but we have AI artificial intelligence working on AI artificial intelligence.
[02:41:03.371 --> 02:41:12.675]  We have quantum encryption, which is a new concept, but I kept saying it for months here and elsewhere, that basically we no longer just
[02:41:13.215 --> 02:41:21.921]  Codify anything we do it at a quantum level and the ones who are doing this along us along with us is other Chinese They're very good in class.
[02:41:21.921 --> 02:41:42.855]  I say how come the Democrats and these old thinkers with one-dimensional thinking where they do a not thinking about how it moves Know that other people like Trump and others now with their own instinct, but also with computers can actually look forward 20 moves I don't I think it makes me feel pathetic that the globalists were in power this long when they're that pathetic Why were we that weak to let them do this?
[02:41:43.735 --> 02:41:44.755]  We weren't that weak.
[02:41:44.755 --> 02:41:48.176]  We basically had to respect the geriatric unit.
[02:41:48.176 --> 02:41:49.717]  You have Dianne Feinstein, 84.
[02:41:49.717 --> 02:41:51.177]  You have Soros, 87.
[02:41:51.177 --> 02:41:54.218]  You have Pelosi, 79.
[02:41:54.218 --> 02:41:57.679]  You have McCain, who's an idiot and a war criminal.
[02:41:57.679 --> 02:41:59.079]  I mean, this is what happened.
[02:41:59.079 --> 02:42:02.780]  It had to be cleaned out by the people of the United States.
[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:04.640]  You and I could target them.
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.721]  You and I could go after them verbally and then eventually
[02:42:08.141 --> 02:42:10.985]  They were spotted, but it's like anything else.
[02:42:10.985 --> 02:42:15.992]  A revolution takes place, but it's occurring much faster than you would have imagined.
[02:42:15.992 --> 02:42:20.758]  When we first started 17 years ago, you and I didn't know we would be on.
[02:42:20.758 --> 02:42:23.242]  Quite frankly, there were people who threatened me.
[02:42:23.642 --> 02:42:28.766]  The FBI gave me subpoenas where I had to show up before a prosecutor.
[02:42:28.766 --> 02:42:31.628]  You, in turn, you had to show up at court.
[02:42:31.628 --> 02:42:34.850]  So it was an endless series of fights that we had to live.
[02:42:34.850 --> 02:42:40.674]  They're basically a geriatric unit with very little memory and very little thinking capacity.
[02:42:40.674 --> 02:42:41.195]  That's right.
[02:42:41.195 --> 02:42:44.177]  And they think they're going to whack us on the head and we're going to go away.
[02:42:44.177 --> 02:42:45.018]  It's the other way around.
[02:42:45.758 --> 02:42:46.739]  It's the other way around.
[02:42:46.739 --> 02:42:50.721]  The more they hit us, the better it is because it makes us more important.
[02:42:50.721 --> 02:42:52.822]  They created their own monster.
[02:42:52.822 --> 02:42:53.543]  Welcome.
[02:42:53.543 --> 02:42:53.883]  That's right.
[02:42:53.883 --> 02:42:54.703]  We'll be back with your call.
[02:42:54.703 --> 02:42:58.005]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.005 --> 02:42:59.426]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[02:42:59.426 --> 02:43:00.287]  Devon in Florida.
[02:43:00.287 --> 02:43:00.687]  You're on the air.
[02:43:01.696 --> 02:43:02.136]  Great!
[02:43:02.136 --> 02:43:03.237]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:43:03.237 --> 02:43:07.842]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:43:07.842 --> 02:43:09.483]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:43:09.483 --> 02:43:17.050]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:43:17.050 --> 02:43:17.930]  Wow, thank you.
[02:43:17.930 --> 02:43:20.293]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:43:20.293 --> 02:43:21.834]  Which supra-surgical did you like best?
[02:43:22.094 --> 02:43:25.557]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:43:25.557 --> 02:43:26.838]  That's really incredible.
[02:43:26.838 --> 02:43:29.901]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:43:29.901 --> 02:43:31.242]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[02:43:31.242 --> 02:43:32.923]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:43:32.923 --> 02:43:36.326]  And I love the guys, I love the Info Wars crew.
[02:43:36.326 --> 02:43:43.191]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[02:43:43.191 --> 02:43:44.232]  You will love it.
[02:43:44.232 --> 02:43:46.034]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:43:46.354 --> 02:43:50.788]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:50.788 --> 02:43:51.651]  It's a win-win.
[02:43:51.651 --> 02:43:52.634]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:56.758 --> 02:44:02.640]  Senator Rand Paul is warning that the Trump haters at the FBI still have their top-secret security clearance.
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.001]  The senator is demanding that exposed enemies of President Trump should be fired.
[02:44:07.001 --> 02:44:17.885]  Paul tweeted out a copy of a response he was sent in March to an earlier letter where he asked whether FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page still had security clearances.
[02:44:18.485 --> 02:44:46.398]  And the response from FBI Assistant Director Gregory Brower reads, On a Fox News appearance, Senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials, who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human, and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected, can still access information regarding the investigation, posing a potential threat to national security.
[02:44:46.638 --> 02:44:52.522]  Paul said Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump and they need to be fired.
[02:44:52.522 --> 02:44:56.564]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[02:44:56.564 --> 02:44:59.586]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:44:59.586 --> 02:45:03.788]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:45:03.788 --> 02:45:11.133]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:45:11.133 --> 02:45:14.255]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:45:14.955 --> 02:45:34.472]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:45:35.012 --> 02:45:39.135]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:45:39.135 --> 02:45:50.364]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:45:50.364 --> 02:45:55.468]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:45:56.028 --> 02:46:07.496]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:46:07.496 --> 02:46:14.980]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:24.887]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[02:46:25.347 --> 02:46:30.370]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[02:46:30.370 --> 02:46:40.656]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:46:40.656 --> 02:46:46.039]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:46:46.519 --> 02:46:59.188]  When you purchase it at m4wrestore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:46:59.188 --> 02:47:01.790]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:15.168 --> 02:47:22.832]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.832 --> 02:47:23.952]  I want to be clear.
[02:47:23.952 --> 02:47:27.394]  The reason I brought this up for Dr. Steve McShannock is I know he has some of the best sources out there.
[02:47:27.394 --> 02:47:30.536]  He's been so accurate over the 17 years I've been talking to him.
[02:47:30.536 --> 02:47:31.736]  Hard to believe it's been that long since 2002.
[02:47:33.997 --> 02:47:48.343]  It was early 2002, I first started interviewing him, and he was saying Bin Laden was dead, now they bring him out on ice later, and I've talked to Navy SEALs and people that weren't blown up from Dev Group, and they just say that they're not going to talk, but yeah, it's all fake.
[02:47:48.343 --> 02:48:01.108]  But just to say stuff like that on air, it's really dangerous, so people know, I mean, it's... But this was just handed to me, BuzzFeed News, how YouTube channel recommends
[02:48:02.697 --> 02:48:05.118]  And pushes users to the fringe.
[02:48:05.118 --> 02:48:13.620]  And then BuzzFeed, the people who gave me the PP dossier and all the rest of it, major Soros funded, say, look, related channels, InfoWars.com, Alex Jones.
[02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:15.600]  Now they've got a shadow ban still.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:18.541]  They're blocking us because there's a mutiny in YouTube.
[02:48:18.541 --> 02:48:20.942]  But imagine them openly calling.
[02:48:20.942 --> 02:48:24.623]  The old Google algorithm is what's most popular
[02:48:26.016 --> 02:48:26.817]  Is what's promoted.
[02:48:26.817 --> 02:48:28.057]  It's called YouTube.
[02:48:28.057 --> 02:48:31.399]  Now for a while YouTube's gotten rid of the original algorithm and it basically broke it.
[02:48:31.399 --> 02:48:34.221]  That's why the search results didn't work for the last few months.
[02:48:34.221 --> 02:48:36.202]  Now they're kind of in between it bringing it back.
[02:48:36.202 --> 02:48:40.425]  There is a war inside it, but Chenick knows the details from his sources and agencies.
[02:48:40.425 --> 02:48:44.027]  He obviously won't tell us, but he did say this was going to happen.
[02:48:44.027 --> 02:48:45.848]  But there's two points, and then we're going to the calls.
[02:48:45.848 --> 02:48:50.851]  There's the announcement that I need to be banned from the internet and de-platformed, that it's bad to let people see my search results.
[02:48:52.244 --> 02:48:56.286]  When Google's unrecognizable to what it used to be just a year ago, it's just horrible.
[02:48:56.286 --> 02:48:58.128]  It's kind of gone back a little bit.
[02:48:58.128 --> 02:48:59.548]  You see their testing.
[02:48:59.548 --> 02:49:01.690]  When Bing and things like Microsoft are much better.
[02:49:02.824 --> 02:49:03.004]  I don't
[02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:31.715]  It is admitted in QTEL and the NASA bases and all of it that, you know, Google was founded based with NSA technology.
[02:49:31.715 --> 02:49:33.976]  It's a public-private partnership for national security.
[02:49:33.976 --> 02:49:34.877]  I get it.
[02:49:34.877 --> 02:49:36.378]  And it was a DARPA projection.
[02:49:36.378 --> 02:49:39.440]  That's actually in the, you know, the white papers.
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:41.442]  People don't really see that, but that's admitted.
[02:49:41.442 --> 02:49:45.725]  So I knew when you said that days before it was admitted that there was some historical accuracy.
[02:49:45.725 --> 02:49:51.669]  But then when it happened and we got restored, it's taken them a month to go through Natural News and thousands of other sites and restore them.
[02:49:53.044 --> 02:49:55.846]  Somebody restores them and somebody goes in and deletes the subscribers.
[02:49:55.846 --> 02:49:57.247]  Somebody puts the subscribers back in.
[02:49:57.247 --> 02:50:02.251]  When you've got an infrastructure this big, this is a crazy civil war inside Google.
[02:50:02.251 --> 02:50:05.273]  So what can you tell us about the civil war inside Google?
[02:50:05.273 --> 02:50:07.775]  This is just intriguing.
[02:50:07.775 --> 02:50:14.640]  What's really happening inside Google is that they're going to be losing a lot of their clients as well as the cash flows.
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:17.923]  What happened when Zuckerberg came and testified in Congress
[02:50:18.741 --> 02:50:23.824]  It basically tanked Facebook in terms of values.
[02:50:23.824 --> 02:50:36.471]  If you look at Google and its accumulation distribution in the stock market, it has what we call a D to E rating, meaning that nobody wants to accumulate the stock and it's basically a dead asset.
[02:50:36.471 --> 02:50:41.074]  And isn't that a warning to them for their treason, just like Trump just drove down Amazon $34 billion?
[02:50:42.355 --> 02:50:44.156]  Well, that's exactly the point.
[02:50:44.156 --> 02:50:53.459]  But when you don't have investors, particularly the big investors on Wall Street and elsewhere, or I played... Investors don't want to invest in authoritarianism.
[02:50:53.459 --> 02:50:54.860]  It sucks!
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:50:55.440]  No.
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:56.480]  And that's the point.
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:51:00.882]  Not only don't they want to invest in authoritarianism, they know this is antiquated.
[02:51:00.882 --> 02:51:06.324]  They know that there are other algorithms that are coming in at a much faster rate where we can break Google.
[02:51:06.724 --> 02:51:11.173]  We can break Facebook, we can break any one of these things, and they know it.
[02:51:11.173 --> 02:51:13.618]  The YouTube and Google province really belong together.
[02:51:13.618 --> 02:51:17.707]  So Trump gave them chances to move forward, they didn't, and now they're going to be put to death politically.
[02:51:19.608 --> 02:51:29.779]  I think so, politically and economically, because Zuckerberg should have been thrown out if you were in any way part of the Sandy Road or Sandy Hill hedge fund.
[02:51:29.779 --> 02:51:32.601]  I would have thrown out Zuckerberg, even though he's a majority holder.
[02:51:32.601 --> 02:51:33.522]  He's a disaster.
[02:51:39.329 --> 02:51:43.033]  I mean, a top actor couldn't act like a robot like him.
[02:51:43.033 --> 02:51:54.245]  The narcissistic little Jewish boy who copied a lot of things, went out of his way to get a movie called Social Network, was not that brilliant, created a story and a narrative.
[02:51:54.585 --> 02:51:56.327]  Like a hundred of these guys.
[02:51:56.327 --> 02:51:58.369]  Basically, he's not the genius.
[02:51:58.369 --> 02:52:04.274]  The genius were the people in the CIA and DARPA when they saw this in the 50s and 60s.
[02:52:04.274 --> 02:52:10.040]  No, my dad saw it when he was just at UT in the Plan 2 when he was in high school.
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:13.964]  They were showing CD-ROMs and social networks and InfoG and everything.
[02:52:14.938 --> 02:52:18.241]  All you have in Zuckerberg is a promoter, a self-promoter.
[02:52:18.241 --> 02:52:20.443]  He didn't do anything that was unusual.
[02:52:20.443 --> 02:52:22.645]  He didn't create anything that was unusual.
[02:52:22.645 --> 02:52:29.271]  If you look at social network, you'll see where he stole a lot of things, where in fact, he's a faulted character.
[02:52:29.271 --> 02:52:34.295]  I'm not bragging about my dad, but he always talks about the thing he was most proud of when he was like a senior in high school.
[02:52:34.295 --> 02:52:40.841]  He wrote a paper called Information Energy, or InfoG, that then got snatched up, he said, by DARPA, and they asked him never to talk about it.
[02:52:41.141 --> 02:52:48.284]  But I mean, I'm sure other people were simultaneously saying the same thing, but my dad was talking about social networks in like 1967.
[02:52:48.284 --> 02:52:55.367]  Well, the only thing he should have done is, while he was a dentist, he should have started up a company in Austin, and I wish him the best.
[02:52:55.367 --> 02:52:57.768]  But the genes clearly come through to you.
[02:52:57.768 --> 02:52:58.768]  You're bright.
[02:52:58.768 --> 02:52:59.548]  You see it.
[02:52:59.548 --> 02:53:00.029]  You understand it.
[02:53:00.029 --> 02:53:00.729]  Well, enough about me.
[02:53:00.729 --> 02:53:02.450]  I'm just saying, I want to know why they're attacking us.
[02:53:03.470 --> 02:53:06.633]  You have to understand it's not just you.
[02:53:06.633 --> 02:53:09.995]  I compare you to the left and to Congress.
[02:53:09.995 --> 02:53:10.716]  They're dead.
[02:53:10.716 --> 02:53:11.857]  They're brain dead.
[02:53:11.857 --> 02:53:13.398]  They don't get any of this.
[02:53:13.398 --> 02:53:14.619]  They don't understand it.
[02:53:14.619 --> 02:53:16.281]  They sit among themselves.
[02:53:16.281 --> 02:53:20.144]  It's like a circle of geriatric patients talking about nonsense.
[02:53:20.544 --> 02:53:26.628]  Whereas we're on the outside accumulating information at a very fast rate and they cannot absorb it.
[02:53:26.628 --> 02:53:35.554]  There's no way they can... Well that's why they got rid of HUMET is because they didn't want us to have the original HUMET and then they rely only on the technocracy which there's so much info it blinds them.
[02:53:36.530 --> 02:53:48.857]  Well, but also they didn't have a character like Alex Jones to be able to articulate the narrative with passion, humor, and zeal, and more importantly, resistance.
[02:53:48.857 --> 02:53:52.119]  That's the one thing that you cannot see on television.
[02:53:52.119 --> 02:53:54.661]  It's the one thing you don't see in the movie business.
[02:53:54.661 --> 02:53:56.862]  It's the one thing you don't see in politics.
[02:53:56.862 --> 02:54:00.645]  They stay there for a few years to get their pension and then they leave.
[02:54:00.645 --> 02:54:06.048]  You don't go into politics if you're an entrepreneur, you're a creator like yourself, you want to
[02:54:06.368 --> 02:54:10.189]  Break all the paradigms or at least have an American Revolution.
[02:54:10.189 --> 02:54:11.990]  You don't go into politics for that.
[02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:18.572]  That's basically... Well yeah, I saw the Socialist Globalist Dirtbag Revolution and had to resist it, just like our audience does.
[02:54:18.572 --> 02:54:19.952]  And they're awesome for holding.
[02:54:19.952 --> 02:54:20.753]  Dr. Stephen Chennick.
[02:54:20.753 --> 02:54:21.933]  StephenChennick.com is on the list.
[02:54:21.933 --> 02:54:23.313]  Find his books there on the site.
[02:54:23.313 --> 02:54:26.294]  Really smart guy and he's not BS and he's got the connections.
[02:54:26.294 --> 02:54:28.895]  So many times he's just got amazing info for us.
[02:54:28.895 --> 02:54:31.156]  So does Zach, who I want to get back on as soon as possible.
[02:54:31.856 --> 02:54:32.757]  We know his identity.
[02:54:32.757 --> 02:54:33.899]  Great info as well.
[02:54:33.899 --> 02:54:36.561]  Catherine in Canada, thanks for holding and then Carlos and others.
[02:54:36.561 --> 02:54:41.026]  You're on the air worldwide during the 34-hour emergency broadcast.
[02:54:41.026 --> 02:54:43.249]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:54:43.249 --> 02:54:44.270]  I'm doing alright.
[02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:45.111]  Pretty crazy world.
[02:54:45.111 --> 02:54:45.631]  How are you doing?
[02:54:45.631 --> 02:54:48.034]  I'm glad that Trump's backing off World War III talk.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:51.342]  Yeah, no, I think that's all theater, actually.
[02:54:51.342 --> 02:54:55.586]  But I have a point to do about Comey.
[02:54:55.586 --> 02:55:10.738]  So I just want to make a point about if the Russians were trying to blackmail the incoming president, why wouldn't the FBI and Comey himself do everything in their power to protect him from the blackmail, but instead use it, intimidated him with the information that just blows up?
[02:55:11.479 --> 02:55:13.363]  If that was true, that's collusion with the Russians.
[02:55:13.363 --> 02:55:22.460]  If the president really did it, because of national security, the CIA would be trying to block that and deal with it, instead of the FBI using it, and of course they funded the whole fake thing.
[02:55:25.495 --> 02:55:25.615]  Yes.
[02:55:42.833 --> 02:55:53.284]  Well, I was about to say, let's let her finish.
[02:55:53.284 --> 02:55:58.570]  They have built Mueller up like he's the shadow president, and they're rogue completely.
[02:55:58.570 --> 02:56:00.312]  Trump has a responsibility to fire him.
[02:56:00.312 --> 02:56:01.393]  I know people say, well, don't do that.
[02:56:01.393 --> 02:56:03.094]  It makes him look like he's guilty.
[02:56:03.715 --> 02:56:06.076]  At a certain point, where are the indictments?
[02:56:06.076 --> 02:56:07.477]  What's up with Rosenstein?
[02:56:07.477 --> 02:56:10.739]  Where is the stuff with Mueller getting in trouble for covering up for Hillary?
[02:56:10.739 --> 02:56:12.720]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:14.601]  We did not elect Robert Mueller!
[02:56:15.538 --> 02:56:16.178]  I agree with you.
[02:56:16.178 --> 02:56:18.759]  That's why I was asking to fire him years ago.
[02:56:18.759 --> 02:56:19.979]  The man is corrupt.
[02:56:19.979 --> 02:56:21.939]  He was compromised in 9-11.
[02:56:21.939 --> 02:56:25.140]  He took over the FBI a week before 9-11.
[02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:31.021]  This was a former Vietnam War hero who compromised himself and made it disgusting.
[02:56:31.021 --> 02:56:32.962]  He basically is corrupt.
[02:56:32.962 --> 02:56:38.243]  And remember the deputy director tried to stop it and then he took a job at the World Trade Center and died the day of the attack.
[02:56:39.232 --> 02:56:41.774]  Well, there was another person, unfortunately, who died.
[02:56:41.774 --> 02:56:47.240]  It was a CIA operative named John Neal, and he knew exactly what was going on, and he died there.
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:53.926]  That's John O'Neal, the Deputy Head of Counterterrorism for the FBI, but you're now saying he was CIA?
[02:56:53.926 --> 02:56:55.487]  Yes.
[02:56:55.487 --> 02:56:56.008]  Yeah.
[02:56:56.008 --> 02:56:59.231]  So the whole point is, is that that's how crazy this is.
[02:56:59.231 --> 02:57:01.113]  There are good people in the government.
[02:57:01.113 --> 02:57:02.294]  Catherine, go ahead and finish up.
[02:57:03.531 --> 02:57:12.438]  I just think when the Inspector General's report starts to drop portions of it, I think their whole narrative is going to blow up, and I think you might see some indictments by then.
[02:57:12.438 --> 02:57:16.422]  I think they're waiting for the Comey book to counter it with the OIG.
[02:57:16.422 --> 02:57:16.842]  No, I agree.
[02:57:16.842 --> 02:57:18.483]  That's when Trump punches back.
[02:57:18.483 --> 02:57:21.145]  I want to ask Dr. Corsi when we come back, though.
[02:57:21.145 --> 02:57:27.150]  We're trying, not Dr. Corsi, I'm going to get Dr. Corsi's coming up later today on the show, I think during the war, and that's why I said that.
[02:57:30.126 --> 02:57:37.036]  I want to ask him about, what do we do though if they kill Trump or they stage a bunch more false flags?
[02:57:37.036 --> 02:57:41.262]  Because we know they're desperate, they're crazy, they have the strength of crazy criminals.
[02:57:41.262 --> 02:57:43.646]  What do we do about that if they start a civil war?
[02:57:43.646 --> 02:57:44.347]  Because it could go that way.
[02:57:46.323 --> 02:57:51.807]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:57:51.807 --> 02:57:52.647]  I take this.
[02:57:52.647 --> 02:57:53.768]  My family takes this.
[02:57:53.768 --> 02:57:58.071]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:57:58.071 --> 02:58:02.294]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:02.674 --> 02:58:07.297]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:58:07.297 --> 02:58:08.437]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:08.437 --> 02:58:12.199]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:58:12.199 --> 02:58:14.881]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:14.881 --> 02:58:20.684]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:20.684 --> 02:58:23.646]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:23.646 --> 02:58:27.067]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.067 --> 02:58:29.409]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.409 --> 02:58:29.769]  I love it.
[02:58:29.929 --> 02:58:32.730]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:33.730]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:33.730 --> 02:58:39.391]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:39.391 --> 02:58:41.571]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:58:41.571 --> 02:58:42.812]  It's a win-win.
[02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:46.432]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:46.432 --> 02:58:53.974]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:58:55.589 --> 02:59:06.440]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:08.542]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.542 --> 02:59:12.547]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:12.547 --> 02:59:14.729]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best
[02:59:14.969 --> 02:59:19.773]  Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.773 --> 02:59:22.175]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:22.175 --> 02:59:24.817]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:59:24.817 --> 02:59:25.758]  That's my dad.
[02:59:25.758 --> 02:59:27.599]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:59:27.599 --> 02:59:30.101]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:30.101 --> 02:59:39.288]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:59:39.288 --> 02:59:43.752]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:49.229 --> 02:59:51.819]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.386 --> 03:00:15.069]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:15.069 --> 03:00:16.711]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:16.711 --> 03:00:21.577]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.231 --> 03:00:36.794]  Looking at this, the Democrats are hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:00:36.794 --> 03:00:39.095]  We've got documents that we've confirmed are real.
[03:00:39.095 --> 03:00:44.119]  George Soros hasn't denied them, his son hasn't denied them that they're trying to cause race war, civil war on the streets.
[03:00:44.119 --> 03:00:51.484]  They've not been successful with how they work with Blue City, Democrat police departments, where they're knocking windows out and burning trash cans, but it's scripted.
[03:00:51.484 --> 03:00:53.905]  They have a threat continuum, it's all planned out.
[03:00:53.905 --> 03:00:56.167]  They're trying to get other people to get violent.
[03:00:56.167 --> 03:00:57.247]  We published that months ago.
[03:00:57.247 --> 03:00:59.749]  I mean, this is serious criminal activity.
[03:00:59.749 --> 03:01:00.210]  Should I get
[03:01:01.144 --> 03:01:04.687]  We don't want to be too precipitous to clean them out.
[03:01:04.687 --> 03:01:08.170]  I'm not an authoritarian, I'm a libertarian, but I feel derelict.
[03:01:09.113 --> 03:01:27.303]  Watching them do this, and them trying to gear up a coup, and just all the wild-eyedness that's going on, and trying to sabotage the economy, and we have a clear and present danger, a book he wrote, turned into a movie, here in this country, and I don't want to underestimate these people, that's all I'm saying.
[03:01:27.303 --> 03:01:29.904]  What keeps you awake at night, Dr. Pachinic?
[03:01:29.904 --> 03:01:34.327]  I mean, I know we're winning overall Americana free market worldwide, but
[03:01:36.035 --> 03:01:37.857]  They could grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[03:01:37.857 --> 03:01:41.142]  And I don't want to also give them ideas, because I used to think they were smart.
[03:01:41.142 --> 03:01:43.885]  I realize they're just dumb, but they're like cancer, willing to take over.
[03:01:43.885 --> 03:01:44.646]  That's why they're in power.
[03:01:44.646 --> 03:01:46.509]  But how are they going to strike back?
[03:01:48.251 --> 03:01:52.292]  What do we do if they start killing people, or they stage a bunch more false flags?
[03:01:52.292 --> 03:01:53.172]  We know they're doing that.
[03:01:53.172 --> 03:01:56.793]  We know they're winding it up, preparing it, lining the people up, standing down.
[03:01:56.793 --> 03:02:00.574]  I mean, and they're so pissed we're exposing that.
[03:02:00.574 --> 03:02:04.715]  That tells me that they want me discredited ahead of the next narrative they launch.
[03:02:04.715 --> 03:02:05.536]  They don't even get to that.
[03:02:05.536 --> 03:02:06.376]  People tune in even more.
[03:02:06.376 --> 03:02:09.377]  They're just so... They have this... I mean, you're the psychiatrist.
[03:02:09.377 --> 03:02:13.938]  There's narcissism where they think they're invincible, but that's their weakness and their strength, isn't it?
[03:02:15.566 --> 03:02:17.088]  No, it's more of their weakness.
[03:02:17.088 --> 03:02:19.330]  It's not even an issue of narcissism.
[03:02:19.330 --> 03:02:23.155]  It's grandiosity that really has no basis in reality.
[03:02:23.155 --> 03:02:30.162]  All they're doing is, the tighter they become on the target, which is yourself, me, or Trump.
[03:02:30.162 --> 03:02:31.164]  Target psychosis!
[03:02:32.441 --> 03:02:33.001]  I'm sorry?
[03:02:33.001 --> 03:02:34.462]  Target psychosis?
[03:02:34.462 --> 03:02:37.764]  Well, we say you're fixation on a target.
[03:02:37.764 --> 03:02:39.845]  That's basically what we say in the military.
[03:02:39.845 --> 03:02:42.266]  So you've missed the entire target.
[03:02:42.266 --> 03:02:50.310]  And at the same time, while they're focusing in on Trump, he's being able to retaliate so fast.
[03:02:50.310 --> 03:02:52.511]  And it's not only the Democrats.
[03:02:52.511 --> 03:02:54.532]  What he's done is to make sure Ryan is left.
[03:02:54.532 --> 03:02:55.812]  Oh yeah, why is Paul Ryan leaving?
[03:02:55.812 --> 03:02:57.393]  I forgot that question.
[03:02:57.393 --> 03:02:59.194]  Yeah, I mean, this is not an accident.
[03:02:59.194 --> 03:03:01.435]  You predicted six months ago that he'd be going.
[03:03:02.202 --> 03:03:02.762]  Correct.
[03:03:02.762 --> 03:03:14.732]  And I said there would be 20 to 25 different Republicans, so-called Republicans, who are moderates or didn't support Tom, have no idea what he's doing, have no idea where the Republican... and they're leaving.
[03:03:14.732 --> 03:03:18.975]  And that was part of his agenda, except he didn't say it outright.
[03:03:18.975 --> 03:03:21.077]  He said, you're either with me or against me.
[03:03:21.077 --> 03:03:25.480]  But the tighter you come in on him, the more effective he becomes.
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.143]  And that's why you, myself, and I... what keeps me up at night?
[03:03:29.858 --> 03:03:31.079]  Not really very much.
[03:03:31.079 --> 03:03:36.664]  I go up the next day and I say, okay, is my garbage can gone?
[03:03:36.664 --> 03:03:44.510]  Here's the thing, we can all put a good face on it and things are going our way, the worm's turning, but they are bullying the hell out of individuals.
[03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:47.413]  I want to look at the negative position here.
[03:03:48.171 --> 03:03:53.252]  The negative position is basically repetition again and again.
[03:03:53.252 --> 03:03:57.293]  It's almost repetition compulsion of a neurotic or a psychotic person.
[03:03:57.293 --> 03:03:58.774]  They repeat the same thing.
[03:03:58.774 --> 03:03:59.694]  It's a mantra.
[03:03:59.694 --> 03:04:01.194]  There's a mantra.
[03:04:01.194 --> 03:04:01.615]  Correct.
[03:04:01.615 --> 03:04:02.355]  It's a mantra.
[03:04:02.355 --> 03:04:03.175]  He's lazy.
[03:04:03.175 --> 03:04:03.815]  He's tired.
[03:04:03.815 --> 03:04:04.975]  He doesn't know what to do.
[03:04:04.975 --> 03:04:06.396]  It was in the New York Times.
[03:04:06.396 --> 03:04:07.156]  He's crazy.
[03:04:07.156 --> 03:04:07.736]  He's stupid.
[03:04:07.736 --> 03:04:09.156]  He needs to not listen to that.
[03:04:09.156 --> 03:04:10.637]  He needs to stop reading the New York Times.
[03:04:11.579 --> 03:04:16.564]  Not really, because what happens in turn, it's really paradoxical intention.
[03:04:16.564 --> 03:04:20.468]  I'd like him to listen to it, because what he does... It makes him come back stronger.
[03:04:20.468 --> 03:04:29.997]  He comes back stronger, and then you see the real Twitter war, where he comes in and he will devastate people right and left, and they don't really understand what happened.
[03:04:30.357 --> 03:04:32.379]  So they think he's uncontrollable.
[03:04:32.379 --> 03:04:34.020]  No, he's very controllable.
[03:04:34.020 --> 03:04:37.303]  It's only he has to depend on what time he does it.
[03:04:37.303 --> 03:04:43.608]  He has to listen to his friends, or as Landowski and Stone have said, let him be Trump.
[03:04:43.608 --> 03:04:44.789]  He's going to be what he is.
[03:04:44.789 --> 03:04:46.771]  He built a billion-dollar business.
[03:04:46.771 --> 03:04:49.153]  He went out of his way to build us a nice business.
[03:04:49.153 --> 03:04:49.793]  He did his way.
[03:04:49.793 --> 03:04:52.695]  We'll be back with Carlos, Jeff, Ryan, Matt, David, and Nemo.
[03:04:52.695 --> 03:04:52.996]  Stay there.
[03:04:54.761 --> 03:04:55.562]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.562 --> 03:05:05.709]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.709 --> 03:05:14.236]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.236 --> 03:05:23.023]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:35.362]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:35.362 --> 03:05:44.684]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.684 --> 03:05:47.364]  It is amazing!
[03:05:47.364 --> 03:05:52.325]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:06:06.189 --> 03:06:10.576]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:10.576 --> 03:06:12.559]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.559 --> 03:06:18.488]  Alright, I get so wrapped up in target fixation that I don't even plug last hour.
[03:06:18.488 --> 03:06:19.169]  And why wouldn't I?
[03:06:20.154 --> 03:06:23.035]  One plug can deal with one of these lawsuits.
[03:06:23.035 --> 03:06:24.135]  And that's the good news.
[03:06:24.135 --> 03:06:27.816]  The bad news is they got notice of two more to be filed next week.
[03:06:27.816 --> 03:06:28.596]  These are bigger.
[03:06:28.596 --> 03:06:30.137]  They're still frauds.
[03:06:30.137 --> 03:06:33.998]  We had, I got corrected yesterday by the lawyers, we had two dismissed last week.
[03:06:33.998 --> 03:06:37.479]  One was about a thousand, one was ten thousand in lawyers fees to get it dismissed.
[03:06:37.479 --> 03:06:46.141]  And I mean, but these, these lawyer mills just turn up the heat and just, it's like all former Clinton lawyers and Soros people.
[03:06:46.141 --> 03:06:47.642]  We've got to do slapback suits.
[03:06:48.735 --> 03:06:48.815]  I'm
[03:07:03.706 --> 03:07:09.709]  Older Uncle went down on a boat carrying weapons to England in World War II and his family died in Vietnam.
[03:07:09.709 --> 03:07:15.871]  They had really tough jobs with all the foot rot and the VCs and Korean War and everything.
[03:07:15.871 --> 03:07:17.112]  So I'm not a hero.
[03:07:17.112 --> 03:07:20.593]  I'm really blessed to be fighting these people and just have sorrow suing me and stuff.
[03:07:20.593 --> 03:07:22.154]  I'm glad they haven't sent somebody to kill me.
[03:07:23.339 --> 03:07:24.440]  But they know they're being watched.
[03:07:24.440 --> 03:07:25.600]  They know they can't get away with that now.
[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:26.841]  It's a 21st century war.
[03:07:26.841 --> 03:07:29.002]  I'm just saying it's an epic time to be alive.
[03:07:29.002 --> 03:07:31.663]  We have the very best deep earth iodine.
[03:07:31.663 --> 03:07:33.024]  Nobody else has it.
[03:07:33.024 --> 03:07:34.705]  People are trying to figure that out.
[03:07:34.705 --> 03:07:36.365]  Now companies are coming in wanting to buy it up.
[03:07:36.365 --> 03:07:39.267]  It's about to be in shampoos and stuff that a major company is going to put out.
[03:07:39.907 --> 03:07:40.627]  I can tell you that's why.
[03:07:40.627 --> 03:07:42.688]  They just jacked up the price on us.
[03:07:42.688 --> 03:07:44.789]  And then they say, we might not even have it for you.
[03:07:44.789 --> 03:07:53.032]  So we've already called more than 10 oil companies that get distillates and derivatives and things and different mineral extractions.
[03:07:53.032 --> 03:08:00.735]  As you have to understand, the wells, $30 million a drill, some 10,000 foot well, get them to stop and grab deep earth iodine is a big deal.
[03:08:00.735 --> 03:08:04.097]  Even though we sell a lot of it, we're still not in the market compared to oil and gas.
[03:08:05.310 --> 03:08:07.292]  This is pure, true atomic iodine.
[03:08:07.292 --> 03:08:08.813]  Nobody else has it.
[03:08:08.813 --> 03:08:15.960]  We had folks harass us and try to stop us five years ago to kill our clean seaweed version that was a lot weaker but still pure, but it wasn't atomic.
[03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:18.002]  So we ended up getting this just by the grace of God.
[03:08:18.002 --> 03:08:19.764]  Well, it could be over.
[03:08:19.764 --> 03:08:21.385]  And believe me, I'm not happy about that.
[03:08:21.385 --> 03:08:22.346]  We're about to sell out of it.
[03:08:22.346 --> 03:08:23.887]  We got maybe two more runs we can do.
[03:08:24.448 --> 03:08:26.208]  But that shipment's already going up.
[03:08:26.208 --> 03:08:32.710]  It's got to be kept in a DEA facility in Houston, and then it's made in a special lab because pure iodine obviously has other uses.
[03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:34.850]  Once it's put in the palm oil, it doesn't.
[03:08:34.850 --> 03:08:38.991]  But it's key to IQ, stamina, energy.
[03:08:38.991 --> 03:08:40.351]  It's made me lazy.
[03:08:40.351 --> 03:08:44.532]  I was swimming two miles every other day, everything, and couldn't lose weight six years ago.
[03:08:44.532 --> 03:08:48.073]  I went on pure atomic iodine, and it was just like I lost 40 pounds.
[03:08:48.073 --> 03:08:48.973]  It just made me lazy.
[03:08:48.973 --> 03:08:49.933]  I haven't even worked out this week.
[03:08:50.393 --> 03:08:51.174]  And I'm just kidding.
[03:08:51.174 --> 03:08:52.334]  I was, you know, six, seven years ago.
[03:08:52.334 --> 03:08:53.635]  I mean, I'm good up.
[03:08:53.635 --> 03:08:57.197]  I'm a pesky guy, but I've actually lost a lot of weight.
[03:08:57.197 --> 03:09:00.019]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:09:00.019 --> 03:09:04.922]  And on Monday, I'm gonna go back to full price, which is 40 bucks.
[03:09:04.922 --> 03:09:07.644]  And again, we don't put seven time markups on these products.
[03:09:07.644 --> 03:09:08.524]  We put on average about 150%.
[03:09:08.524 --> 03:09:09.205]  That's one and a half markup.
[03:09:11.593 --> 03:09:15.095]  I'm thinking about not doing that anymore just because of all the globalist operations.
[03:09:15.095 --> 03:09:19.798]  I want to give, you know, and I could play the game of raising the price then lowering it and saying it's 50% off.
[03:09:19.798 --> 03:09:22.159]  When we say 50% off, it's really 50% off.
[03:09:22.159 --> 03:09:23.500]  Well, it's 25% off right now.
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:24.600]  That's about to end.
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:27.001]  Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula is back in stock.
[03:09:27.001 --> 03:09:28.582]  Great anti-inflammatory.
[03:09:28.582 --> 03:09:29.403]  That's there.
[03:09:29.403 --> 03:09:30.183]  So many other products.
[03:09:30.183 --> 03:09:31.584]  The Alpha Power is back in stock, 25% off.
[03:09:31.584 --> 03:09:34.466]  You get free shipping on orders for $50 or more.
[03:09:34.466 --> 03:09:36.627]  But just know this.
[03:09:36.627 --> 03:09:38.708]  You cannot give the globalists a bigger black eye.
[03:09:39.713 --> 03:09:52.517]  And stand up against them in supporting free speech, because they see this show and our guests as a constellation of resistance and information that's so close to what's really going on, not that we're perfect, we all see through rose-colored glasses, that they want it shut down.
[03:09:52.517 --> 03:09:54.457]  And I agree with Pachinko.
[03:09:54.457 --> 03:10:04.480]  The one-dimensional thing of crushing us when we already did our job, we still want to be here and still want to help and all the rest of it, but there's a real satisfaction in being the rock that hits the pond.
[03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:07.761]  Because your parents and your ancestors and the culture got you there.
[03:10:07.761 --> 03:10:08.801]  They threw you.
[03:10:08.801 --> 03:10:15.143]  You hit, and then the waves have already gone back and bounced back, and by then they realize that you see a hundred more rocks about to hit.
[03:10:15.143 --> 03:10:18.004]  They don't even see the hundred other rocks in the air.
[03:10:18.004 --> 03:10:24.385]  They were worried about crushing the spot where the rock hit 23 years ago, and they don't even get that already it's an exponential wave.
[03:10:24.385 --> 03:10:29.167]  But quite frankly, that wave, Dr. Pachenko, I'm going to call, scares me because the unknown
[03:10:30.572 --> 03:10:31.653]  Let me put it this way.
[03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.214]  You and I have had lawsuits.
[03:10:33.214 --> 03:10:35.617]  I've had them since I left medical school in 1968.
[03:10:35.617 --> 03:10:37.018]  So in every business I was in.
[03:10:52.993 --> 03:10:53.833]  Yes, we are.
[03:11:08.599 --> 03:11:23.352]  To really go into a kind of a mutual relationship with the adversary where we can tone down the rhetoric, tone down the emotions and allow the kabuki, whether it's right or wrong, the kabuki of so-called justice to play out.
[03:11:23.352 --> 03:11:25.093]  So I have been there with you.
[03:11:25.093 --> 03:11:28.356]  I'm still there with you filing lawsuits against the minds.
[03:11:28.797 --> 03:11:31.499]  Against water companies, against all types of things.
[03:11:31.499 --> 03:11:35.782]  But I haven't stopped doing that since I was in my 20s or 30s.
[03:11:35.782 --> 03:11:40.586]  And that's not including when I did an operational field because I never used lawyers there.
[03:11:40.586 --> 03:11:48.051]  But in a way, the point of success, and it's ironic, is to have these lawsuits and continuously fight back.
[03:11:48.371 --> 03:11:49.991]  The lawyers love this.
[03:11:49.991 --> 03:11:52.692]  Unfortunately, that's the way our system works.
[03:11:52.692 --> 03:11:53.452]  But it works.
[03:11:53.452 --> 03:11:59.854]  When you push back, the system doesn't want to continue to keep paying and hitting Alex Jones.
[03:11:59.854 --> 03:12:02.214]  That's the same way I would go all the time.
[03:12:02.214 --> 03:12:07.276]  I'd have to hire a lawyer in Hollywood, a lawyer in the publishing industry, a lawyer here.
[03:12:07.276 --> 03:12:08.776]  Everywhere I looked, I had a lawyer.
[03:12:09.316 --> 03:12:15.120]  But, for the most part, they are your allies in order to create a new narrative.
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:19.222]  Well, what I'm saying, it's the Republican lawyers that are always the good ones, it's the Democrats that are the bad ones.
[03:12:19.222 --> 03:12:23.965]  I mean, more and more I realize that the Republican establishment is bad, but the Democrat lawyers are the scum of the earth.
[03:12:23.965 --> 03:12:26.066]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air with Dr. Steve Puccinetti.
[03:12:26.066 --> 03:12:26.487]  Go ahead.
[03:12:26.487 --> 03:12:26.967]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:28.140 --> 03:12:29.440]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:12:29.440 --> 03:12:33.422]  It's a great pleasure to speak to both of you.
[03:12:33.422 --> 03:12:36.423]  Most informative and powerful analysis.
[03:12:36.423 --> 03:12:42.765]  I wanted to draw your attention to what is defined as the swamp.
[03:12:42.765 --> 03:12:47.627]  In my opinion, the problem in the United States, which President Trump can solve,
[03:12:48.689 --> 03:13:06.120]  Not easily, but he is able to is that the problem of congressmen and senators who receive money from foreign powers indirectly through agencies and friends and so on and and are able to without even reading the legislation sometimes just pass it through and
[03:13:09.022 --> 03:13:09.543]  Exactly.
[03:13:09.543 --> 03:13:14.507]  The idea that Trump's a foreign power when it's the globalists that have sold us out is asinine.
[03:13:14.507 --> 03:13:15.287]  So what do we do?
[03:13:15.287 --> 03:13:16.528]  How do we identify the swamp?
[03:13:16.528 --> 03:13:17.829]  He didn't hire any lobbyists.
[03:13:17.829 --> 03:13:20.832]  How does Trump go completely ape and start indicting a bunch of these people?
[03:13:21.966 --> 03:13:30.077]  Well, it's a matter of democracy, information, a matter of informing the public as to who's taking money from where.
[03:13:30.077 --> 03:13:32.380]  Some of these people are room temperature IQ.
[03:13:32.380 --> 03:13:34.102]  Well, they're so dumb.
[03:13:34.102 --> 03:13:34.603]  The U.S.
[03:13:34.603 --> 03:13:36.485]  had half the world industrial power.
[03:13:36.886 --> 03:13:37.346]  We're good to go.
[03:13:54.966 --> 03:14:14.763]  Yes, and as it turns out, you've got a situation where a foreign leader of, could be Saudi Arabia or Israel, can go to the Senate, to the Congress, get standing ovations, you know, to the embarrassment of the President, to the embarrassment of the community they're supposed to serve, and turn around and, ignoring things like the Symington,
[03:14:19.447 --> 03:14:20.107]  Absolutely.
[03:14:20.107 --> 03:14:21.568]  What about boomeranging around?
[03:14:21.568 --> 03:14:24.711]  Like Trump let the submariner off the show, the 50-year-old submarine.
[03:14:24.711 --> 03:14:25.371]  It was no big deal.
[03:14:25.371 --> 03:14:26.272]  It was all bull.
[03:14:26.272 --> 03:14:27.373]  They found it in a landfill.
[03:14:27.373 --> 03:14:28.794]  Clearly a setup.
[03:14:28.794 --> 03:14:33.117]  He pardoned that guy because he's showing how Hillary did 1,000, 10,000 times that.
[03:14:33.117 --> 03:14:34.859]  What about boomeranging back?
[03:14:34.859 --> 03:14:38.282]  I mean, why won't the Justice Department, Dr. Buchanan, go after
[03:14:39.548 --> 03:14:42.970]  All the clear sellouts to foreign powers that Hillary got caught in.
[03:14:42.970 --> 03:14:43.470]  Why?
[03:14:43.470 --> 03:14:44.050]  Why?
[03:14:44.050 --> 03:14:44.251]  Why?
[03:14:44.251 --> 03:14:48.513]  Like you said, why does he fire Rosenstein and these people?
[03:14:48.513 --> 03:14:50.634]  I don't know why he doesn't fire them.
[03:14:50.634 --> 03:14:56.117]  I can tell you I wouldn't trust them because most of them are bureaucrats who have really no vested interest.
[03:14:56.678 --> 03:15:05.722]  In serving our country, what they basically do along with the politician is their concern about their own viability or their own livelihood.
[03:15:05.722 --> 03:15:16.408]  If you look at a congressman or senator... But don't they get if they bet on a country like this with the resources and the culture, they get everything by betting on the country instead of worrying about their own stupid asses!
[03:15:17.233 --> 03:15:19.254]  Then I'm looking at the United States.
[03:15:19.254 --> 03:15:24.778]  They're looking at their own specific amount of money that they receive, their salary.
[03:15:24.778 --> 03:15:25.259]  No, I agree.
[03:15:25.259 --> 03:15:27.681]  They think Trump's mentally ill because he cares about America.
[03:15:27.681 --> 03:15:28.541]  It's America.
[03:15:28.541 --> 03:15:30.783]  It is exceptional, idiots.
[03:15:30.783 --> 03:15:31.683]  It's the Renaissance.
[03:15:31.683 --> 03:15:32.784]  We have to bet on it.
[03:15:32.784 --> 03:15:34.025]  Or the chi-coms.
[03:15:34.025 --> 03:15:36.347]  We're going to do one more segment and then Joel Gilbert's coming up.
[03:15:36.347 --> 03:15:36.947]  Thank you, Carlos.
[03:15:36.947 --> 03:15:39.369]  We're going to go Jeff, Ryan, Matt, Nemo, and David.
[03:15:39.369 --> 03:15:41.290]  I swear we're going to each call her one minute.
[03:15:41.290 --> 03:15:43.312]  We'll have 30 seconds on each caller and I'm going to shut up.

[03:15:49.627 --> 03:15:51.271]  That guy's not gonna be around much longer, is he?
[03:15:53.109 --> 03:15:54.630]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:57.091]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[03:15:57.091 --> 03:15:59.813]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:15:59.813 --> 03:16:05.136]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best expose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.136 --> 03:16:10.819]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.819 --> 03:16:14.261]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[03:17:53.973 --> 03:18:01.437]  Did President Trump nearly fire special counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of some fake news?
[03:18:01.437 --> 03:18:10.261]  According to a New York Times article published this week, Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsel's office subpoenaed his bank records.
[03:18:10.261 --> 03:18:15.284]  The Times reported that Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he'd set for the Mueller probe.
[03:18:15.284 --> 03:18:23.108]  The stories about the bank subpoenas, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg, turned out to be inaccurate and the outlets issued a correction.
[03:18:23.388 --> 03:18:26.670]  Noting the subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates.
[03:18:26.670 --> 03:18:32.512]  This week the President tweeted, And this isn't the first time that the New York Times has reported that the President considered firing Mueller.
[03:18:32.512 --> 03:18:36.594]  The Times reported that the President demanded White House Counsel Don McGahn fire Mueller in June 2017.
[03:18:48.860 --> 03:18:51.814]  But Trump backed down after McGahn threatened to resign.
[03:18:51.814 --> 03:18:53.401]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com

[03:20:15.736 --> 03:20:21.540]  Then, we've got a great guest host coming up, Joel Gilbert, with a big guest and key breaking intel.
[03:20:21.540 --> 03:20:23.261]  Always has amazing guests on.
[03:20:23.261 --> 03:20:26.484]  And Joel lets me pop in here on these Friday editions when I need to go over.
[03:20:26.484 --> 03:20:27.665]  I appreciate him.
[03:20:27.665 --> 03:20:31.948]  He's welcome to come back later during the 34-hour broadcast on The War Room as well.
[03:20:31.948 --> 03:20:33.769]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:35.811]  But when I am openly saying that
[03:20:36.966 --> 03:20:41.809]  Humanity needs a world government that doesn't have governmental power.
[03:20:41.809 --> 03:20:47.712]  It needs a system where people come together, they discuss, they make unilateral deals country to country.
[03:20:47.712 --> 03:20:54.596]  That's the next step in humanity, but not some secret authoritarian thing where corporations that are greedy run it or you get rid of sovereignty.
[03:20:54.596 --> 03:20:56.237]  I see it as America, 1776, worldwide is what I call it.
[03:20:59.125 --> 03:21:05.992]  And true free market and true open societies countering George Soros' open society that's a counterfeit and a fraud of that.
[03:21:05.992 --> 03:21:15.302]  So I made that point that America with all its wealth, all its power, because it was the most free country in the world, had the whole future ahead of it, but the robber barons leveraged this out.
[03:21:16.240 --> 03:21:22.882]  You know, the smarts of the yeoman farmer and the folks working in factories couldn't translate into the robber barons and the big elites.
[03:21:22.882 --> 03:21:28.744]  And so we've now seen the globalists last half century, but that thing is coming to an end and they're panicking.
[03:21:28.744 --> 03:21:34.386]  You know, Dr. Pchenik, we're going to these calls right now, but briefly, a guy called up and said, Oh, Alex, the globalists aren't losing.
[03:21:34.386 --> 03:21:35.346]  We need to get violent.
[03:21:35.346 --> 03:21:37.146]  But the guy's always calling for the violence.
[03:21:37.146 --> 03:21:38.727]  They're not leading the violence.
[03:21:38.727 --> 03:21:42.148]  I really think the prognosis is good for nationalism and free market.
[03:21:43.334 --> 03:21:48.743]  After all, it works so much better than tyranny and communism and socialism and authoritarianism.
[03:21:48.743 --> 03:21:51.327]  Really, if we just promote it and expose it, don't you think we'll win?
[03:21:52.512 --> 03:21:53.853]  I think we're winning already.
[03:21:53.853 --> 03:21:56.134]  The fact is, look at the economy.
[03:21:56.134 --> 03:21:57.715]  It's been on a roar.
[03:21:57.715 --> 03:22:00.796]  I mean, we have really had an incredible growth.
[03:22:00.796 --> 03:22:05.078]  We've had the lowest unemployment rate in years.
[03:22:05.078 --> 03:22:13.422]  We have been able to finish a war in Iraq and in Syria and pretty much in Afghanistan.
[03:22:13.422 --> 03:22:15.363]  I mean, we are in great shape.
[03:22:15.903 --> 03:22:21.267]  The real issue for the globalists is that they do not understand what America is about.
[03:22:21.267 --> 03:22:27.952]  Soros is what we call the Judenrat Hungarian Jew, who really is not relevant to us.
[03:22:27.952 --> 03:22:30.154]  He was a traitor to other people.
[03:22:30.154 --> 03:22:36.659]  I mean, when you are basically compromised in your character, the rest of your life you're compromised.
[03:22:36.659 --> 03:22:41.583]  Again, as a psychiatrist studying his activities, what is his problem?
[03:22:42.475 --> 03:22:51.141]  His problem is, I could give you a psychiatric diagnosis, but he's pretty much of an a-hole.
[03:22:51.141 --> 03:22:54.664]  I mean, that's what I would say is his diagnosis.
[03:22:54.664 --> 03:22:56.305]  He's a raving a-hole.
[03:22:56.305 --> 03:23:04.571]  I know, I've met him, I find him totally ignorant and totally unpleasant, but he's not the relevance part.
[03:23:04.571 --> 03:23:10.676]  What's relevant is for you to maintain and for us to maintain where the country's going at a very fast rate.
[03:23:11.116 --> 03:23:16.584]  We're starting to get millennials into the political system who watch you, who listen to you.
[03:23:16.584 --> 03:23:20.270]  Whether they're the left or the right, they're coming in and they're beginning to understand.
[03:23:20.270 --> 03:23:23.294]  Number one, you serve the country however you want to serve it.
[03:23:23.294 --> 03:23:26.219]  Number two, you then come back and serve it in a civilian form.
[03:23:26.679 --> 03:23:29.580]  Number three, you get involved in local politics.
[03:23:29.580 --> 03:23:31.841]  As LBJ, it's always local.
[03:23:31.841 --> 03:23:36.964]  The Osoroses and the Peloses and the Feinstein, they're fossils.
[03:23:36.964 --> 03:23:37.944]  They're... No, I agree.
[03:23:37.944 --> 03:23:40.505]  Their huge exhibition of energy is their death throes.
[03:23:40.505 --> 03:23:41.726]  That is the true statement today.
[03:23:41.726 --> 03:23:42.206]  Correct.
[03:23:42.206 --> 03:23:43.166]  David?
[03:23:43.166 --> 03:23:44.427]  David in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[03:23:44.427 --> 03:23:44.727]  Go ahead.
[03:23:44.727 --> 03:23:46.928]  Thanks for holding.
[03:23:46.928 --> 03:23:48.569]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:48.569 --> 03:23:55.292]  I want you to know that you have a great following within the 18 Wheeler community, and we really appreciate the information that we get.
[03:23:57.020 --> 03:24:01.662]  I'm a big fan of the Brain Force, the Alpha Male.
[03:24:01.662 --> 03:24:11.666]  I've used many of your products and it took a few weeks before I could tell, but my doctor told me I needed vitamin D. I use your bone and joint
[03:24:12.159 --> 03:24:15.620]  I use your winter sun, and what a big difference.
[03:24:15.620 --> 03:24:16.681]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[03:24:16.681 --> 03:24:18.001]  We don't just give people stimulants.
[03:24:18.001 --> 03:24:22.923]  We give them what the top scientists, not me, say is the building blocks you're missing, so it takes a few weeks.
[03:24:22.923 --> 03:24:23.243]  Exactly.
[03:24:23.243 --> 03:24:25.744]  This is not instant, you know, paper over stuff.
[03:24:25.744 --> 03:24:30.726]  This is, this takes a few weeks, like X2, you name it, but once it kicks in.
[03:24:30.726 --> 03:24:34.768]  Yeah, and once it kicks in, and then, you know, there's times when I have to drive all night.
[03:24:34.768 --> 03:24:36.649]  I take two Brain Force.
[03:24:36.649 --> 03:24:38.809]  It doesn't matter if I even drink coffee.
[03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:39.950]  I don't even need coffee.
[03:24:40.433 --> 03:24:49.986]  And it's clear I can concentrate on my driving and I just want you to know that I have contributed.
[03:24:49.986 --> 03:24:54.311]  I'm probably coming up on $1,000 right now of products that I've bought.
[03:24:54.311 --> 03:24:55.092]  I've got over 2,500 points of
[03:24:56.792 --> 03:25:00.193]  Patriot Points right now, and I'm going to order some more stuff today.
[03:25:00.193 --> 03:25:01.813]  Well, let me say this, David.
[03:25:01.813 --> 03:25:03.474]  If you weren't here, we'd be shut down.
[03:25:03.474 --> 03:25:07.375]  I mean, I don't just tell the audiences to patronize.
[03:25:07.375 --> 03:25:10.476]  If you weren't supporting, we wouldn't have Trump in.
[03:25:10.476 --> 03:25:11.656]  We wouldn't have this platform.
[03:25:11.656 --> 03:25:12.336]  It'd be all over.
[03:25:12.336 --> 03:25:15.537]  So thank you so much for your support, sir.
[03:25:15.537 --> 03:25:15.917]  Yes, sir.
[03:25:15.917 --> 03:25:18.138]  I appreciate it.
[03:25:18.138 --> 03:25:19.658]  I fly in for awards.
[03:25:19.658 --> 03:25:20.479]  Your bumper stickers.
[03:25:20.479 --> 03:25:22.059]  I get bumper stickers when I order stuff.
[03:25:22.059 --> 03:25:25.440]  I put it on my window on the inside so it can't be removed.
[03:25:26.274 --> 03:25:35.659]  And I'll tell you what, I have conversations, I wear your t-shirts, and I wore one, you know, Hillary from prison had Gerald Searles on the back of it.
[03:25:36.115 --> 03:25:41.938]  And I'm waiting there to pay for stuff, and these drivers come up to you and start talking about George Soros.
[03:25:41.938 --> 03:25:47.502]  I mean, we know, and I mean, there's so many drivers that follow you.
[03:25:47.502 --> 03:25:50.323]  Yeah, what is it, Dr. Pachinik, about truck drivers?
[03:25:50.323 --> 03:25:53.825]  They seem to be not left or right, but just super-informed patriots.
[03:25:53.825 --> 03:25:54.946]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:25:54.946 --> 03:25:56.247]  Truck drivers out of any group...
[03:25:57.060 --> 03:25:59.061]  I've invested in a lot of truck drivers.
[03:25:59.061 --> 03:26:03.562]  Number one, believe it or not, the truck drivers are very independent.
[03:26:03.562 --> 03:26:14.305]  What they really do is they own their own trucks and what they depend on is a very sophisticated information system that tells them where to pick up the load, how much the load is,
[03:26:14.745 --> 03:26:15.986]  We're to take the load.
[03:26:15.986 --> 03:26:23.809]  So they are very sophisticated business people who know exactly what they need, what they want to do, and what it takes.
[03:26:23.809 --> 03:26:25.050]  So this is an example.
[03:26:25.050 --> 03:26:28.792]  This gentleman is a great example of why America's great.
[03:26:28.792 --> 03:26:31.513]  Trucks are moving everywhere over the United States.
[03:26:31.513 --> 03:26:32.794]  By the way, I knew what you were going to say.
[03:26:32.794 --> 03:26:37.936]  I remember like five years ago you said the truck driver is the archetype of America.
[03:26:37.936 --> 03:26:38.897]  I remember you saying that.
[03:26:39.485 --> 03:26:40.185]  That's correct.
[03:26:40.185 --> 03:26:46.127]  And I believe that they have become the archetype of America because that's their independent freedom.
[03:26:46.127 --> 03:26:47.927]  They drive when they want to.
[03:26:47.927 --> 03:26:49.648]  They pick up the loads they want to.
[03:26:49.648 --> 03:26:53.949]  They know where to go when they go over to another place a thousand miles away.
[03:26:53.949 --> 03:26:54.969]  They have another load.
[03:26:54.969 --> 03:26:56.210]  They bring it back.
[03:26:56.210 --> 03:26:57.570]  They know what the shipment is.
[03:26:57.570 --> 03:26:59.171]  They know how much it costs.
[03:26:59.171 --> 03:27:01.871]  You can't get more sophisticated than a truck driver.
[03:27:01.871 --> 03:27:03.652]  It's like a land-based merchant marine.
[03:27:03.652 --> 03:27:04.092]  It's an army.
[03:27:04.533 --> 03:27:05.154]  Got it.
[03:27:05.154 --> 03:27:06.276]  Exactly right.
[03:27:06.276 --> 03:27:09.824]  And they have to deal with sophisticated internet capacities.
[03:27:09.824 --> 03:27:12.970]  Now, do you think our politicians know anything about it?
[03:27:12.970 --> 03:27:13.071]  No.
[03:27:14.082 --> 03:27:18.343]  Basically, the truckers are the most amazing business people I've ever met.
[03:27:18.343 --> 03:27:22.324]  And by the way, they're the most courteous on the road and they're formidable.
[03:27:22.324 --> 03:27:24.244]  They're the ones who make the road go.
[03:27:24.244 --> 03:27:26.585]  I was just asking why I've been on the air 23 years.
[03:27:26.585 --> 03:27:28.685]  It's the truckers of any group.
[03:27:28.685 --> 03:27:30.786]  We should make the show more about truckers.
[03:27:30.786 --> 03:27:33.887]  They are the most the most active patriotic group.
[03:27:33.887 --> 03:27:34.427]  It's crazy.
[03:27:34.427 --> 03:27:35.067]  Other than veterans.
[03:27:36.021 --> 03:27:39.142]  Well, because they are like you and I. They're business people.
[03:27:39.142 --> 03:27:42.123]  If you haven't, you know, everybody says you've got to go to college.
[03:27:42.123 --> 03:27:43.383]  No, you don't have to go to college.
[03:27:43.383 --> 03:27:45.864]  You have to understand what it is that you can do.
[03:27:45.864 --> 03:27:49.045]  And if you're a trucker, you go to school, you learn how to drive the truck.
[03:27:49.045 --> 03:27:51.086]  It's a very sophisticated system.
[03:27:51.086 --> 03:27:53.487]  But at the same time, you take the risk.
[03:27:53.487 --> 03:27:54.467]  You take the load.
[03:27:54.467 --> 03:27:55.588]  You take the upside.
[03:27:55.588 --> 03:27:56.608]  You take the leverage.
[03:27:56.608 --> 03:27:57.448]  You know the gas.
[03:27:57.448 --> 03:27:58.589]  You know the wear out.
[03:27:58.589 --> 03:27:59.889]  You know the depreciation.
[03:27:59.889 --> 03:28:02.790]  You know the length of time that the truck can go in.
[03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:05.351]  And it's that process that's empowering to the individual.
[03:28:06.081 --> 03:28:09.243]  It's totally empowering, and it's empowering to our country.
[03:28:09.243 --> 03:28:11.864]  The more trucks we have, the more trade we have.
[03:28:11.864 --> 03:28:14.626]  And you can see it east, west, and north, south.
[03:28:14.626 --> 03:28:19.789]  I mean, I live right in the middle of Florida, and you see trucking going from Jacksonville to Gainesville.
[03:28:19.789 --> 03:28:20.950]  It's constant.
[03:28:20.950 --> 03:28:22.731]  And we're building more roads.
[03:28:22.731 --> 03:28:26.853]  So the infrastructure project is the next thing Trump is going to talk about.
[03:28:26.853 --> 03:28:28.174]  Who else is talking about it?
[03:28:28.174 --> 03:28:30.195]  I haven't heard a president talk about that yet.
[03:28:30.942 --> 03:28:34.563]  So the tractor is the penultimate American entrepreneur.
[03:28:34.563 --> 03:28:35.964]  All right, God bless you, David.
[03:28:35.964 --> 03:28:41.365]  Listen, I said I wouldn't go any further, and Larry Klainman's coming up with breaking news with Joel Gilbert, but I've got to go to Nemo.
[03:28:41.365 --> 03:28:44.106]  When we come back, Tom Clancy died mysteriously.
[03:28:44.106 --> 03:28:47.667]  I don't know if that's true, but we know that Stephen Shinnick was good friends with him.
[03:28:47.667 --> 03:28:50.668]  We'll find out about that real fast, and Joel Gilbert's taking over.
[03:28:50.668 --> 03:28:51.048]  Stay with us.
[03:28:53.140 --> 03:28:54.040]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:54.040 --> 03:28:56.442]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:56.442 --> 03:29:04.586]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[03:29:04.586 --> 03:29:06.527]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[03:29:23.314 --> 03:29:25.174]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:29:25.174 --> 03:29:33.777]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:29:54.329 --> 03:30:00.794]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in Fuller's life, it'd take hours.
[03:30:00.794 --> 03:30:03.236]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:30:03.236 --> 03:30:04.417]  It's stronger.
[03:30:04.417 --> 03:30:06.018]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:30:06.018 --> 03:30:09.241]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:30:09.241 --> 03:30:10.362]  It's back in stock.
[03:30:10.362 --> 03:30:13.544]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:30:13.544 --> 03:30:16.867]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:30:17.447 --> 03:30:17.527]  It's
[03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:38.033]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[03:30:38.033 --> 03:30:39.434]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[03:30:49.367 --> 03:30:52.411]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:53.880 --> 03:30:57.464]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:30:57.464 --> 03:30:59.246]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:10.497]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:31:11.278 --> 03:31:20.483]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:31:20.483 --> 03:31:26.426]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:31:26.426 --> 03:31:31.528]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:31:31.528 --> 03:31:34.150]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:35.870]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:40.673]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[03:31:40.913 --> 03:31:45.857]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:31:45.857 --> 03:31:48.499]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:31:48.499 --> 03:31:53.203]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:31:53.783 --> 03:31:57.546]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:31:57.546 --> 03:32:04.591]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[03:32:04.591 --> 03:32:09.355]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[03:32:09.355 --> 03:32:10.096]  It's very simple.
[03:32:10.096 --> 03:32:12.598]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[03:32:12.598 --> 03:32:14.539]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[03:32:14.539 --> 03:32:18.222]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[03:32:18.222 --> 03:32:20.384]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[03:32:20.384 --> 03:32:21.004]  It's $19.95 right now.
[03:32:23.186 --> 03:32:26.228]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[03:32:26.228 --> 03:32:30.671]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:34.514]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[03:32:34.514 --> 03:32:38.396]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:32:38.396 --> 03:32:41.558]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[03:32:41.558 --> 03:32:45.201]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[03:32:45.201 --> 03:32:47.802]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[03:32:47.802 --> 03:32:48.803]  It's amazing.
[03:32:48.803 --> 03:32:51.405]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:32:57.689 --> 03:33:11.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.758 --> 03:33:16.921]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.444 --> 03:33:21.606]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:33:21.606 --> 03:33:25.249]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:33:25.249 --> 03:33:29.211]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:33:29.211 --> 03:33:33.054]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:33:33.054 --> 03:33:37.057]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[03:33:37.057 --> 03:33:39.438]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:33:45.011 --> 03:33:49.934]  Never saw Merle Haggard in concert.
[03:33:49.934 --> 03:33:57.119]  I was buying tickets to see him in like Waco in a month when he died in South Texas.
[03:33:57.759 --> 03:34:00.660]  Yeah, I think it was like Corpus Christi or something from pneumonia.
[03:34:00.660 --> 03:34:01.560]  Side issue.
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:02.660]  I apologize to Joel Gilbert.
[03:34:02.660 --> 03:34:12.203]  When he signed on to do Friday's One Hour, I told him occasionally I'd hijack it, but he's welcome to come on with Larry Klayman during the War Room or during the 34-hour broadcast that's going on, or in the last segment here in a few minutes.
[03:34:12.203 --> 03:34:16.744]  But I swore to go to these phone calls, so we're doing it right now.
[03:34:16.744 --> 03:34:17.705]  Thank you, David in Oklahoma.
[03:34:17.705 --> 03:34:18.645]  Appreciate your call.
[03:34:18.645 --> 03:34:25.667]  Nemo in Massachusetts, you're on the air with the co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books, Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[03:34:25.667 --> 03:34:25.987]  Go ahead.
[03:34:29.554 --> 03:34:32.215]  Okay, you got your question, Nemo?
[03:34:32.215 --> 03:34:33.295]  Got any other questions?
[03:34:33.295 --> 03:34:33.895]  Well, there you go.
[03:34:33.895 --> 03:34:36.696]  You had your question about Tom Clancy died mysteriously.
[03:34:36.696 --> 03:34:37.116]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:34:37.116 --> 03:34:38.456]  You're on the air.
[03:34:38.456 --> 03:34:39.556]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:34:39.556 --> 03:34:40.477]  Big fan.
[03:34:40.477 --> 03:34:43.657]  Yes, well, I haven't been able to get too many direct sources.
[03:34:43.657 --> 03:34:46.418]  I found out kind of late towards the end of the election that he died.
[03:34:46.418 --> 03:34:48.199]  Couldn't find any real coverage on it.
[03:34:48.199 --> 03:34:53.160]  Was asking if the doctor... It did get unusually low coverage for one of the best-selling authors in U.S.
[03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:53.740]  history.
[03:34:53.740 --> 03:34:54.000]  Go ahead.
[03:34:54.861 --> 03:34:55.441]  Absolutely.
[03:34:55.441 --> 03:34:59.944]  I think the main reason for that is he's essentially our first accepted leaker.
[03:34:59.944 --> 03:35:09.069]  You know, he taught the American people what really goes on with all those government dollars and all those programs, and truly a great American in my mind.
[03:35:09.069 --> 03:35:19.375]  But yeah, I only found out through, you know, following the rabbit hole of all the people who had died mysteriously, and yeah, couldn't find any real solid coverage.
[03:35:21.291 --> 03:35:23.652]  Well, one of his good friends was right here.
[03:35:23.652 --> 03:35:27.435]  Was there any hanky-panky or foul play or skullduggery?
[03:35:27.435 --> 03:35:28.835]  No.
[03:35:28.835 --> 03:35:34.239]  Tom was an unusually bright man, a very funny man, a very serious man when he had to write.
[03:35:34.239 --> 03:35:35.559]  We wrote together.
[03:35:35.559 --> 03:35:37.741]  We did a lot of things together.
[03:35:37.741 --> 03:35:42.003]  I can assure you he died a very dignified death, a very quiet death.
[03:35:42.003 --> 03:35:43.064]  I miss him very much.
[03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:51.134]  And the irony of all about Tom, although he wrote these brilliant books, was that he was one of the funniest men I had ever known.
[03:35:51.134 --> 03:35:58.059]  And he would always temper my laughter because I said, Tom, we really should be in the business of writing comedy and humor.
[03:35:58.059 --> 03:36:01.422]  And he said, no, no, no, no, that's much harder than you realize.
[03:36:01.422 --> 03:36:03.203]  So no, we miss him.
[03:36:03.203 --> 03:36:07.266]  I can assure you he died a very dignified and honorable death.
[03:36:07.266 --> 03:36:10.869]  He's a great service to America and he was a great American.
[03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:12.850]  I thank you for the question.
[03:36:12.850 --> 03:36:14.992]  Any other questions, Demo?
[03:36:14.992 --> 03:36:22.777]  I would just like to say thank you to the doctor and that I'll spread that to those of us that are skeptics and seekers.
[03:36:22.777 --> 03:36:25.799]  And please keep continuing to do what you do.
[03:36:25.799 --> 03:36:29.062]  Sure, I don't get in his private life, but I mean, didn't he smoke a lot of cigarettes?
[03:36:30.656 --> 03:36:31.737]  Uh, yes.
[03:36:31.737 --> 03:36:35.318]  I didn't want to get into that, but he did smoke a lot of cigarettes.
[03:36:35.318 --> 03:36:39.640]  There's a little story I had to kind of sidebar.
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:48.243]  When we were in Hollywood together and we were doing the four-hour miniseries, I had to kind of hide some of the cigarettes.
[03:36:48.243 --> 03:36:49.204]  Was that head force?
[03:36:50.285 --> 03:36:51.406]  Huh?
[03:36:51.406 --> 03:36:53.467]  Was that net force?
[03:36:53.467 --> 03:36:55.088]  Boy, that's amazing.
[03:36:55.088 --> 03:36:57.049]  Yes, that was net force.
[03:36:57.049 --> 03:37:03.814]  And we kind of had a game and then he picked up a few cigarettes in one place and then another place.
[03:37:03.814 --> 03:37:06.656]  And I said, well, you missed a couple of points.
[03:37:06.656 --> 03:37:10.258]  And then in the car, he just picked up all the cigarettes he had.
[03:37:10.258 --> 03:37:13.320]  And it's the kind of habit you really can't break.
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:15.462]  But he was a wonderful partner.
[03:37:15.462 --> 03:37:17.243]  I really enjoyed having him.
[03:37:17.243 --> 03:37:18.864]  And he had a great sense of humor.
[03:37:19.464 --> 03:37:20.605]  A great American.
[03:37:20.605 --> 03:37:22.808]  He really loved this country.
[03:37:22.808 --> 03:37:25.911]  And when we worked together, it was just a great pleasure.
[03:37:25.911 --> 03:37:29.094]  But unfortunately, he didn't smoke a lot.
[03:37:29.094 --> 03:37:32.077]  I only started smoking in college when I would drink beer and stuff.
[03:37:32.077 --> 03:37:33.077]  And I didn't like it at first.
[03:37:33.077 --> 03:37:36.441]  And then all of a sudden, I caught myself about eight years ago, smoking a pack a day.
[03:37:36.441 --> 03:37:41.005]  And I went, and my like three-year-old daughter grabbed the cigarettes and threw it in the trash.
[03:37:41.005 --> 03:37:41.325]  That was it.
[03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:43.690]  But, uh, yeah.
[03:37:43.690 --> 03:37:47.931]  If we can do any one thing, we have to warn our audience, please stop smoking.
[03:37:47.931 --> 03:37:51.052]  It really has a very deleterious effect on your body.
[03:37:51.052 --> 03:37:57.734]  When you come in the emergency room, we doctors know automatically, if you even tell us that you didn't smoke, we'll know that.
[03:37:57.734 --> 03:37:59.634]  And it has a deleterious effect.
[03:37:59.634 --> 03:38:03.035]  They put ammonia into the nicotine, so it's addictive.
[03:38:03.035 --> 03:38:04.255]  It's not just psychological.
[03:38:04.255 --> 03:38:06.216]  It's a bunch of chemicals they get away with their grandfather.
[03:38:06.216 --> 03:38:06.836]  That's a great point.
[03:38:07.591 --> 03:38:08.151]  That's correct.
[03:38:08.151 --> 03:38:09.392]  They put all sorts of crap in there.
[03:38:09.392 --> 03:38:10.393]  Nemo, thank you.
[03:38:10.393 --> 03:38:12.235]  Jeff in Canada, you're on there with Dr. Steve Pechenik.
[03:38:12.235 --> 03:38:16.298]  Go ahead.
[03:38:16.298 --> 03:38:17.198]  Hey, Alex, are you there?
[03:38:17.198 --> 03:38:18.900]  Yes, sir.
[03:38:18.900 --> 03:38:33.951]  Hey, um, I just, uh, I'm driving a truck up and down Vancouver Island today and, and, uh, you sharing that segment earlier in the day about, uh, people getting chopped up and, and shot, and you broke my heart, man.
[03:38:33.951 --> 03:38:36.153]  I, I had to stop the truck and cry.
[03:38:37.148 --> 03:38:38.468]  Well, you ought to have to watch the footage.
[03:38:38.468 --> 03:38:50.331]  You know, I got tears in my eyes, and I made myself watch two hours of it in that office, of Al-Qaeda and ISIS chopping up people and making people eat it before they blew their heads off, lying little kids off and laughing when they shot little girls in the head.
[03:38:50.331 --> 03:38:55.412]  That's the kind of footage that's been removed off YouTube most people haven't seen, and that's the satanic behavior of the jihadis.
[03:38:55.412 --> 03:39:06.754]  I don't know how they get those people so whacked out, but I mean, it's like watching Charlie Manchin cut up, you know, the lady he killed, but it's actually happening.
[03:39:07.793 --> 03:39:19.198]  You know, I just thank God for InfoWars and all the wonderful guests that you have on to be able to just bring that information that we'll never hear from MSM.
[03:39:19.198 --> 03:39:23.839]  And I just want to say, you know, I heard about the truck driver and the support.
[03:39:23.839 --> 03:39:29.702]  I just want to say from Canada, I want to just pledge to you today a hundred bucks.
[03:39:29.702 --> 03:39:37.425]  And I want to just, anybody with an earshot of wanting to be free, because there's an international movement against us.
[03:39:38.486 --> 03:39:40.148]  Freedom loving, God loving people.
[03:39:40.148 --> 03:39:50.781]  If you can hear this, support Alex, support the show, support the guests, because maybe you don't think you can afford $100, but if you can afford
[03:39:51.636 --> 03:39:56.377]  To do that, can you afford to be without outlets like yours?
[03:39:56.377 --> 03:39:57.677]  Well, I know this.
[03:39:57.677 --> 03:39:58.178]  I know this.
[03:39:58.178 --> 03:40:04.359]  I have so much faith in people that I'm super confident, but absolutely, I mean, we have the globalist after us.
[03:40:04.359 --> 03:40:05.879]  We have the worst people after us.
[03:40:05.879 --> 03:40:09.620]  And when you support us financially and get great products at the same time, it's seismic.
[03:40:09.620 --> 03:40:10.721]  That's why they hate free market.
[03:40:10.721 --> 03:40:16.082]  Because free market, even if it's limited, gives people a manifestation of their will.
[03:40:16.082 --> 03:40:19.663]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, not the current one, but their law library,
[03:40:21.924 --> 03:40:26.448]  In like 1993, the documents came out that were, you know, from their first run for president.
[03:40:26.448 --> 03:40:32.974]  They were obsessed with not letting libertarians or nationalists or conservatives have a market, have books.
[03:40:32.974 --> 03:40:34.255]  They wanted books shut down.
[03:40:34.255 --> 03:40:35.777]  They wanted videos shut down.
[03:40:35.777 --> 03:40:37.678]  They wanted no economy for us.
[03:40:37.678 --> 03:40:39.020]  Well, they failed, didn't they, Dr. Puccini?
[03:40:40.393 --> 03:40:41.674]  They failed completely.
[03:40:41.674 --> 03:40:50.998]  Ironically, the man behind a lot of what happened in Arkansas was a man by the name of Sam Walton.
[03:40:50.998 --> 03:40:54.479]  If you look back at his history, he was in military intelligence.
[03:40:54.479 --> 03:40:56.060]  He was in fact in charge.
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:40:56.780]  Sure.
[03:41:12.814 --> 03:41:17.199]  And then propagated this notion through the Clintons and others.
[03:41:17.199 --> 03:41:31.233]  But it's a very dangerous collusion that occurred between World War II intelligence reports and people and the ongoing representatives of the state.
[03:41:31.233 --> 03:41:35.597]  And if you see the movie by Tom Cruise, American Made, you're going to understand
[03:41:37.593 --> 03:41:45.261]  I strongly recommend that movie.
[03:41:45.261 --> 03:41:46.863]  I think it's on Amazon.
[03:41:46.863 --> 03:41:50.927]  I'm not a big Cruise fan, but it's an excellent movie.
[03:41:50.927 --> 03:41:51.347]  I saw it.
[03:41:51.347 --> 03:41:52.528]  Very historical, as you said.
[03:41:52.528 --> 03:41:53.329]  God bless you, Jeff.
[03:41:53.329 --> 03:41:53.670]  Thank you.
[03:41:54.150 --> 03:41:55.091]  Look, I'm out of time.
[03:41:55.091 --> 03:41:58.833]  I've already taken 45 minutes away from Joel Gilbert.
[03:41:58.833 --> 03:42:00.114]  I apologize to him, but he signed on.
[03:42:00.114 --> 03:42:01.194]  I know this would happen.
[03:42:01.194 --> 03:42:04.917]  So he can pop back in later, but he's going to have to come up with... Larry Klaman always has great info.
[03:42:04.917 --> 03:42:10.540]  And then Ryan and Matt, I apologize, but we will be back, Lord willing, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:42:10.540 --> 03:42:15.043]  The 36-hour broadcast has three hours, four hours left in it right now.
[03:42:15.043 --> 03:42:17.185]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:42:17.185 --> 03:42:18.545]  Again, just spread those links.
[03:42:18.545 --> 03:42:20.246]  That's the biggest thing you can do.
[03:42:20.246 --> 03:42:21.547]  SteveBuchinick.com.
[03:42:21.547 --> 03:42:22.428]  20 seconds, final comment.
[03:42:24.053 --> 03:42:25.774]  I have full faith in you.
[03:42:25.774 --> 03:42:28.075]  I have full faith in the American public.
[03:42:28.075 --> 03:42:35.799]  I really appreciate the Trumpers of the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, and the Republic will survive and prosper.
[03:42:35.799 --> 03:42:37.640]  Be safe and God bless.
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:38.021]  That's right.
[03:42:38.021 --> 03:42:38.441]  It's true.
[03:42:38.441 --> 03:42:39.481]  These are the death throes.
[03:42:39.481 --> 03:42:43.183]  And some of us that are the focus of the death throes will not make it.
[03:42:43.183 --> 03:42:44.464]  But don't take that as a defeat.
[03:42:44.464 --> 03:42:46.445]  We are going to win.
[03:42:46.445 --> 03:42:47.926]  Nothing is going to stop us.
[03:42:47.926 --> 03:42:49.567]  We can't let these globalists run our lives.
[03:42:49.567 --> 03:42:51.408]  All right, coming up, Joel Gilbert.
[03:42:54.660 --> 03:43:00.522]  Senator Rand Paul is warning that the Trump haters at the FBI still have their top-secret security clearance.
[03:43:00.522 --> 03:43:04.884]  The senator is demanding that exposed enemies of President Trump should be fired.
[03:43:04.884 --> 03:43:15.768]  Paul tweeted out a copy of a response he was sent in March to an earlier letter where he asked whether FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page still had security clearances.
[03:43:16.348 --> 03:43:44.260]  And the response from FBI Assistant Director Gregory Brower reads, On a Fox News appearance, Senator Paul warned that this potentially means that the exposed officials, who called Trump an idiot and a loathsome human, and talked about an FBI secret society and an insurance policy for if Trump was elected, can still access information regarding the investigation, posing a potential threat to national security.
[03:43:44.520 --> 03:43:50.408]  Paul said Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were exposed as enemies of President Trump and they need to be fired.

[03:44:47.296 --> 03:44:50.919]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[03:44:50.919 --> 03:44:55.783]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:44:55.783 --> 03:44:57.024]  Go ahead.
[03:44:57.024 --> 03:44:58.945]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:44:58.945 --> 03:45:09.454]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:45:09.454 --> 03:45:12.817]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:45:13.357 --> 03:45:13.698]  Thank you.
[03:45:13.698 --> 03:45:13.998]  Absolutely.
[03:45:35.998 --> 03:45:48.944]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[03:45:53.880 --> 03:46:00.187]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[03:46:00.187 --> 03:46:08.596]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[03:46:08.596 --> 03:46:13.301]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[03:46:13.661 --> 03:46:17.384]  We only have 150% and then it helps fund our operation.
[03:46:17.384 --> 03:46:20.226]  Well now it's 50% off.
[03:46:20.226 --> 03:46:28.653]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[03:46:28.653 --> 03:46:30.474]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[03:46:30.474 --> 03:46:31.975]  But the two go together.
[03:46:31.975 --> 03:46:33.997]  It's the Mind and Body Challenge.
[03:46:33.997 --> 03:46:43.144]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:43.464 --> 03:46:48.666]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[03:46:48.666 --> 03:46:57.189]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today!
[03:46:57.189 --> 03:46:59.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:21.182 --> 03:47:23.183]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.183 --> 03:47:27.026]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:47:27.026 --> 03:47:34.430]  I'm going to be back at 6 o'clock Eastern for a full hour with Larry Klayman, the attorney.
[03:47:34.430 --> 03:47:47.638]  We're going to talk about the Michael Cohn raid, the Robert Mueller persecution, the FBI mob boss James Comey, all the corruption with the federal judges, as well as the Andrew McCabe report, which just dropped.
[03:47:47.638 --> 03:47:50.420]  So come on back for the War Room later on.
[03:47:51.907 --> 03:47:58.429]  Don't forget, of course, go to the Alex Jones Store, see my new film right there, and purchase it to help the resistance.
[03:47:58.429 --> 03:48:01.389]  It's Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:08.491]  Now I'm going to spend this segment talking about how important it was that Paul Ryan is leaving the House.
[03:48:08.491 --> 03:48:11.652]  I call it good riddance to Paul Ryan.
[03:48:11.652 --> 03:48:14.793]  Paul Ryan is old-school establishment.
[03:48:14.793 --> 03:48:16.213]  He was the Republican leader
[03:48:17.270 --> 03:48:26.093]  In the House during Obama's presidency and he didn't said almost nothing to stop Barack Obama's radical agenda.
[03:48:26.093 --> 03:48:30.975]  Does anyone remember Paul Ryan leading the fight against Obama's open borders?
[03:48:30.975 --> 03:48:38.957]  Does anyone remember Paul Ryan saying anything about the IRS targeting of conservatives and the interference in the 2012 election?
[03:48:38.957 --> 03:48:40.438]  The only reason we had DOJ
[03:48:41.497 --> 03:48:47.499]  And FBI interference in 2016 is because the IRS interfered in 2012.
[03:48:47.499 --> 03:48:51.020]  Paul Ryan and the Republicans did nothing.
[03:48:51.020 --> 03:48:54.201]  Paul Ryan was and is not a fighter.
[03:48:54.201 --> 03:48:56.742]  The Republican base voters want fighters.
[03:48:56.742 --> 03:49:02.664]  So Paul Ryan was never a good fit for Speaker of the House where he got very little done.
[03:49:02.664 --> 03:49:09.167]  I want to play a video of Paul Ryan telling us why he's quitting the House.
[03:49:09.167 --> 03:49:09.967]  Let's play that video.
[03:49:10.618 --> 03:49:15.001]  That's why today I'm announcing that this year will be my last one as a member of the House.
[03:49:15.001 --> 03:49:24.988]  What I realize is, if I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad.
[03:49:24.988 --> 03:49:27.970]  I just can't let that happen.
[03:49:27.970 --> 03:49:30.692]  Okay, so, let's tell the truth here.
[03:49:30.692 --> 03:49:35.995]  Paul Ryan did not resign because he wants to spend time with his teenage kids.
[03:49:35.995 --> 03:49:38.497]  Teenage kids are busy, they don't hang out with dad anyway.
[03:49:40.015 --> 03:49:43.196]  And it's not true that he's only been a weekend father.
[03:49:43.196 --> 03:49:49.738]  Congress is only scheduled to be in session about 130 days every year.
[03:49:49.738 --> 03:49:55.399]  So there's about 225 days with long vacations.
[03:49:55.399 --> 03:49:58.000]  Winter, summer, spring, fall.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:01.801]  So this is just a ridiculous excuse.
[03:50:01.801 --> 03:50:06.722]  Believe me, Paul Ryan's kids are very disappointed that their dad is resigning.
[03:50:06.722 --> 03:50:08.563]  They wish he would go back to Washington.
[03:50:09.324 --> 03:50:10.384]  They come to Washington.
[03:50:10.384 --> 03:50:11.945]  They have a great time.
[03:50:11.945 --> 03:50:20.467]  And these are the most famous kids in Wisconsin because their dad is the speaker 120 days out of a 365-day year.
[03:50:20.467 --> 03:50:23.668]  So, family time is always a generic excuse.
[03:50:23.668 --> 03:50:25.328]  Family time.
[03:50:25.328 --> 03:50:29.089]  For anyone who quits with a very big issue.
[03:50:29.089 --> 03:50:35.211]  So, before I tell you the truth about why Paul Ryan is quitting, let's go back a bit.
[03:50:35.211 --> 03:50:36.211]  Who is Paul Ryan?
[03:50:37.369 --> 03:50:44.754]  Well, the first thing people think of when they see Paul Ryan, they think, well, there's Herman Munster, all grown up.
[03:50:44.754 --> 03:50:48.157]  Herman Munster grew up and he ran for Congress.
[03:50:48.157 --> 03:50:50.759]  That's the first thing they think of.
[03:50:50.759 --> 03:50:55.642]  Now, Paul Ryan did nothing in his life before running for Congress.
[03:50:55.642 --> 03:50:56.843]  He came to Congress at age 28.
[03:50:58.746 --> 03:51:01.307]  Before that, he was an intern.
[03:51:01.307 --> 03:51:05.569]  Paul Ryan was just a congressional intern and then a legislative aide.
[03:51:05.569 --> 03:51:11.331]  So Paul Ryan was a child and is a child of the Washington swamp.
[03:51:11.331 --> 03:51:18.493]  And his alleged love and interest for tax and government reform was not original at all.
[03:51:18.493 --> 03:51:22.555]  It couldn't be because he had no experience in the private sector.
[03:51:22.555 --> 03:51:25.716]  Paul Ryan was a legislative aide for Jack Kemp.
[03:51:26.443 --> 03:51:29.644]  That's where he even got the idea of government reform.
[03:51:29.644 --> 03:51:31.905]  It was not even original.
[03:51:31.905 --> 03:51:39.808]  And again, Paul Ryan didn't do anything in his life before becoming a congressman at age 28.
[03:51:39.808 --> 03:51:46.570]  So you had Paul Ryan, unoriginal, inexperienced, never accomplished anything.
[03:51:46.570 --> 03:51:51.212]  And that's why Mitt Romney chose him for Vice President.
[03:51:51.212 --> 03:51:53.013]  Mitt Romney, establishment guy,
[03:51:53.897 --> 03:51:58.820]  chooses a Washington swamp guy, and that's why they lost.
[03:51:58.820 --> 03:52:02.722]  That's why they lost to Barack Obama, who was very beatable.
[03:52:02.722 --> 03:52:08.525]  Most unsuccessful pro-Russian first term in history of Barack Obama.
[03:52:08.525 --> 03:52:18.110]  Killed the economy, started race wars, you know, abuse of power, fast and furious, and they got two swamp creatures.
[03:52:20.419 --> 03:52:28.982]  Look, the only thing that Paul Ryan accomplished in Congress that he said was the goal of his entire life that he couldn't accomplish for 20 years was tax reform.
[03:52:28.982 --> 03:52:31.643]  And the only way he did it was because of Donald Trump.
[03:52:31.643 --> 03:52:34.864]  This is the guy that Paul Ryan did not even support for president.
[03:52:34.864 --> 03:52:40.606]  For 20 years, Paul Ryan does nothing, and then Trump comes in and gets it done.
[03:52:40.606 --> 03:52:44.568]  Let's remind ourselves of what Paul Ryan felt about Trump's agenda.
[03:52:44.568 --> 03:52:45.608]  Let's look at that video.
[03:52:50.785 --> 03:52:53.246]  Quote, Islam hates us.
[03:52:53.246 --> 03:52:56.268]  Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims?
[03:52:56.268 --> 03:52:57.509]  I mean a lot of them.
[03:52:57.509 --> 03:52:59.110]  I mean a lot of them.
[03:52:59.110 --> 03:53:04.172]  Normally, I do not comment on what's going on in the presidential election.
[03:53:04.172 --> 03:53:05.733]  I will take an exception today.
[03:53:05.733 --> 03:53:13.658]  Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims.
[03:53:13.658 --> 03:53:17.500]  The vast, vast, vast, vast majority of whom are peaceful.
[03:53:18.320 --> 03:53:22.044]  Who believe in pluralism, freedom, democracy.
[03:53:22.044 --> 03:53:31.212]  Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants could never pass Congress, according to the new Republican Speaker of the House.
[03:53:31.212 --> 03:53:39.800]  I think you can oppose the President on some issue that you fundamentally disagree with, but also work with the other party on issues you do agree with.
[03:53:39.800 --> 03:53:41.842]  So why is Ryan quitting Congress?
[03:53:42.665 --> 03:53:46.667]  Paul Ryan is going away because he can't stand Trump winning.
[03:53:46.667 --> 03:53:48.128]  He can't take the winning.
[03:53:48.128 --> 03:53:50.129]  It's too much winning.
[03:53:50.129 --> 03:53:53.791]  He can't stand it that he accomplished nothing and Trump came in and won.
[03:53:53.791 --> 03:54:02.615]  I want to show you a video excerpt from The Art of the Insult about what Trump said he would do in office and how he was going to win.
[03:54:02.615 --> 03:54:03.756]  Let's see that clip.
[03:54:05.538 --> 03:54:07.619]  We're going to win with health.
[03:54:07.619 --> 03:54:09.060]  We're going to win at so many levels.
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:11.742]  We're going to have to win, have to win, have to win.
[03:54:11.742 --> 03:54:17.466]  You're going to get so tired of winning and you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning.
[03:54:17.466 --> 03:54:19.167]  We can't take it anymore.
[03:54:19.167 --> 03:54:21.369]  Mr. President, it's too much.
[03:54:21.369 --> 03:54:23.590]  We can't take this much victory.
[03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:25.031]  Please stop.
[03:54:25.031 --> 03:54:26.132]  And I'll say, no, it isn't.
[03:54:26.132 --> 03:54:27.593]  We have to keep winning.
[03:54:27.593 --> 03:54:29.034]  We have to win more.
[03:54:29.034 --> 03:54:31.295]  We're going to keep winning 100 percent.
[03:54:31.295 --> 03:54:33.056]  America first.
[03:54:33.056 --> 03:54:35.378]  We're going to make our country great.
[03:54:39.401 --> 03:54:44.464]  Okay, so that's my take.
[03:54:44.464 --> 03:54:48.527]  For 20 years, Paul Ryan could not get anything done on tax reform.
[03:54:48.527 --> 03:54:51.669]  Here comes an outsider and he gets tax reform done.
[03:54:51.669 --> 03:54:53.890]  Paul Ryan cannot take the winning.
[03:54:53.890 --> 03:54:55.271]  He doesn't like the winning.
[03:54:55.271 --> 03:54:57.492]  It makes him feel bad.
[03:54:57.492 --> 03:54:59.734]  Paul Ryan is not a winner.
[03:54:59.734 --> 03:55:03.076]  He's afraid that Trump will win even more and make him look even worse.
[03:55:05.410 --> 03:55:12.435]  Paul Ryan, as Trump would say, Paul Ryan wants to go home to Wisconsin and go to sleep.
[03:55:12.435 --> 03:55:21.882]  I think Paul Ryan needs to step down now, not in January, and allow a strong conservative like Jim Jordan to lead the Republicans into the midterms.
[03:55:21.882 --> 03:55:25.064]  So, I'm going to say good riddance to Paul Ryan.
[03:55:25.064 --> 03:55:29.027]  He represents everything we never needed in a leader.
[03:55:29.027 --> 03:55:30.608]  He's not a fighter.
[03:55:30.608 --> 03:55:34.711]  All he wanted to do was placate the establishment because he is
[03:55:35.433 --> 03:55:40.317]  And always will be an establishment swamp creature since he was 28 years old.
[03:55:40.317 --> 03:55:42.079]  That's my take on Paul Ryan.
[03:55:42.079 --> 03:55:47.904]  Now, the FBI and DOJ just released the McCabe Report.
[03:55:47.904 --> 03:55:54.609]  We're going to be speaking for a full hour with Attorney Larry Klayman coming up at 6 o'clock Eastern.
[03:55:54.609 --> 03:55:59.634]  We're also going to look at all the DOJ corruption, the raid on Attorney
[03:56:00.561 --> 03:56:01.982]  Michael Cohen.
[03:56:01.982 --> 03:56:10.527]  A lot of people are saying that that raid on Michael Cohen's office, Donald Trump's attorney, was essentially opposition research.
[03:56:10.527 --> 03:56:14.609]  They're going to grab everything they can and start leaking it to the press.
[03:56:14.609 --> 03:56:18.451]  And they'll use all of that information to build up to the midterms.
[03:56:18.451 --> 03:56:20.232]  They'll leak it out slowly.
[03:56:20.232 --> 03:56:22.114]  Trump paid off this person.
[03:56:22.114 --> 03:56:24.015]  His lawyer paid off that person.
[03:56:24.015 --> 03:56:29.638]  Already, Elliot Broidy, the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee,
[03:56:30.876 --> 03:56:33.997]  Elliot Broidy, big Trump supporter.
[03:56:33.997 --> 03:56:36.038]  What a coincidence.
[03:56:36.038 --> 03:56:47.982]  24, 48 hours after the raid on Michael Cohen's offices, we find out that Michael Cohen represented Elliot Broidy in paying some hush money to a Playboy Playmate.
[03:56:47.982 --> 03:56:49.523]  What a coincidence.
[03:56:49.523 --> 03:56:56.966]  So, I think we're going to see them leak this information slowly and use it against Trump and the Republicans.
[03:56:58.872 --> 03:57:00.795]  The DOJ is out of control.
[03:57:00.795 --> 03:57:04.380]  The Robert Mueller persecution is out of control.
[03:57:04.380 --> 03:57:10.408]  Attorney Larry Klayman can be joining us to go through all these issues and talk about what Trump can and should do.
[03:57:12.732 --> 03:57:17.673]  Again, it's going to be at 6 o'clock Eastern, 3 o'clock Pacific.
[03:57:17.673 --> 03:57:22.674]  Don't forget to go to Alex Jones Store for Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:57:22.674 --> 03:57:25.695]  You won't stop laughing for 95 minutes.

[03:57:29.996 --> 03:57:32.596]  Again, I'm Joel Gilbert, right from the left coast.
[03:57:32.596 --> 03:57:35.937]  I'll see you back at 6 o'clock Eastern with attorney Larry Klayman.

[03:58:49.899 --> 03:58:50.760]  It'd take hours.
[03:58:50.760 --> 03:58:53.202]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:58:53.202 --> 03:58:54.383]  It's stronger.
[03:58:54.383 --> 03:58:56.004]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:56.004 --> 03:58:59.227]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[03:59:00.348 --> 03:59:03.510]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.

[03:59:07.293 --> 03:59:07.433]  Yeah.
[03:59:26.013 --> 03:59:28.014]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[03:59:28.014 --> 03:59:29.395]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
