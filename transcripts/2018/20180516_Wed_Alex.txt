[00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:11.809]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.173]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.335]  Remember two years ago?
[00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:30.706]  The current Congresswoman from Tennessee, one of the Congresswoman from Tennessee, simply ran her own campaign ad on her own Twitter account.
[00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:32.817]  And the video was banned.
[00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:35.098]  And they had congressional hearings.
[00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:36.299]  That was a really big deal.
[00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:45.426]  Well, now there's a state senator who's in the front running for governor in the state where he's running, in Georgia.
[00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.507]  And he has sent us a letter.
[00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.089]  He's happy to come on, but don't want to get him on the next few days.
[00:00:52.833 --> 00:01:02.017]  Facebook, we've also gotten this from other Republican Party candidates, saying you are not allowed to advertise with Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:04.998]  Now let's be clear, we're not getting any money.
[00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.982]  Facebook lets them advertise on the page that our people go to and lets them directly message them.
[00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:20.045]  Now the Democrats brag that they basically control Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, so they're allowed to operate.
[00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:31.466]  But this is clear election racketeering, trying to keep conservative candidates from being able to legally and lawfully reach out and politically advertise or reach out to people.
[00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:32.147]  It's a huge deal.
[00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:33.447]  But here's what's more ominous.
[00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:42.871]  They list Ann Coulter, Breitbart as well, and say on the 24th,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.081]  That's eight days away, nine days away.
[00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.722]  We will, quote, no longer be available on Facebook.
[00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:53.122]  I've been announcing this for two days.
[00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:56.043]  There's an article last night on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:00.504]  I'm gonna ask our folks to retweet that at Real Alex Jones.
[00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.445]  And no one even cares!
[00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:08.407]  Because we're so used to the censorship, and now it's hit the flashpoint.
[00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:12.708]  You can put a piece of paper on top of a hot stove,
[00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:19.080]  Until it hits 450-something degrees, it just browns and yellows, but suddenly it flashes into flame.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:28.408]  We're in that political millisecond right now, where the censorship is just flame on.
[00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:34.432]  It is massive, it is historic, it is draconian, and it is widespread.
[00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:36.134]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.216]  Paul Watson's going to join us as well.
[00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:43.560]  He put out a critique of the violent anti-American
[00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:52.705]  Anti-white race war Childish Gambino video blurred out all the violent stuff.
[00:02:53.606 --> 00:03:05.791]  Well, the Childish Gambino video has been force-fed on YouTube 120 million times to everybody, but Paul's video was blocked in less than six hours after being up on the grounds that it was violent.
[00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:10.954]  But he blurred out the actual simulated killings.
[00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:20.459]  So his critique, the most protected form of speech isn't allowed, and I see the bots on InfoWars commenting, oh, it's a private corporation, it can do whatever it wants.
[00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:20.759]  Really?
[00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:21.419]  YouTube!
[00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.040]  It has the terms of service that it violates with you.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.201]  It's selective.
[00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:27.421]  It's discriminating on a mass platform.
[00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:30.543]  They claim to Congress they'd never do it, that they're a utility.
[00:03:31.943 --> 00:03:33.244]  They could be busted up for this.
[00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:38.065]  Jack Dorsey didn't say, oh, it's our platform, we own it.
[00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:40.826]  On Twitter, he said, we're going to crush conservatives.
[00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:42.067]  Close quote.
[00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:45.939]  We're going to crush you and silence you.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.526]  And they've got the Democratic Party trying to shut down Infowars, trying to kick us off radio stations, trying to ban us from advertising.
[00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:55.448]  This is the opposite of free market.
[00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.830]  It's authoritarianism just like Venezuela.
[00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.654]  It's just how they operate in Cuba and Venezuela.
[00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:04.877]  And it will kill this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.201]  So, it's an amazing time to be alive and it's extremely, extremely dangerous.
[00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:12.082]  So that's all coming up.
[00:04:12.122 --> 00:04:17.565]  Now that's just part of what I'm going to be covering on the historic draconian censorship today.
[00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:24.549]  YouTube allows video depiction of massacre to be watched by children.
[00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.190]  Censors criticism of it.
[00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.932]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:31.393]  Paul's re-uploaded it to Facebook for now.
[00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:34.515]  We have that link in the article so you can see it.
[00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.720]  Just months ago they're in Congress saying we want Alex Jones censored.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.303]  The big three CEOs go, yes sir, we'll get on that congressman quickly right now.
[00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:47.746]  Sir, we censored Paul Watson and Alex Jones at lunch.
[00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.808]  He goes, I know, I saw that, they were number one, I want them censored.
[00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.930]  Fake news, they claim that truck attack in New York was a Muslim.
[00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:54.691]  It was not.
[00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:55.992]  They go, yes sir, it was not.
[00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:58.714]  He screamed Allah Akbar, it's on record, he was.
[00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:01.096]  These are dangerous evil people, folks.
[00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.974]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:13.941]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:18.384]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:24.140]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.541]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:30.646]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com.
[00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:36.752]  Local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:38.493]  And when you financially go to Infowars.com,
[00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:45.278]  When you take advantage of the huge sales and the great products for everything in your life, it's about making your life better.
[00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:48.080]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds, springtime's here.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.583]  The highest quality books, films, pastry apparel to spread the word.
[00:05:52.903 --> 00:05:58.427]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[00:05:58.807 --> 00:06:01.009]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:02.570]  Please shop with the good guys.
[00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:05.697]  We've got it.
[00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:09.438]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:22.362]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:28.804]  So, InfoWars and our radio, TV and internet platforms
[00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.733]  Have been absolutely smashing through the globalist census.
[00:06:40.253 --> 00:06:44.974]  We've been breaking every record, every podcast record, every video download record.
[00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:51.256]  We've been getting numbers only rivaled by hip-hop and major motion pictures.
[00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:59.178]  We conservatively had 86 million views and listens the week of the election 2016 in November.
[00:07:01.394 --> 00:07:06.357]  Despite all their censorship, all their crackdowns, we're exploding on talk radio and on television.
[00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:14.923]  But on the internet, they have crushed us down to 20-30 million views a week.
[00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:27.351]  But they've said that for the 2018 election, they are going to basically end all conservative, libertarian, Christian, nationalist media.
[00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:34.270]  And it's been announced, it's been caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas, but now they're having congressional hearings, it's happening.
[00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:47.521]  And Facebook has announced that as of the 24th of this month, eight, nine days away, Breitbart, InfoWars, and Coulter, and at least others, will no longer be available.
[00:07:49.264 --> 00:08:05.256]  When senators and congressmen and gubernatorial candidates and state senators go and they try to buy, not advertising with us, they try to go, showing what Facebook does, and buy being able to place ads to InfoWars supporters.
[00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:06.657]  They don't even make any money.
[00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.559]  Zuckerberg does.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.223]  They're saying those sites will no longer be available.
[00:08:17.605 --> 00:08:18.686]  Now, what does that tell you?
[00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:36.616]  It tells you they're either going to totally shadow ban us on Facebook on the 24th, or something even more draconian, because if they're telling people, hey, sorry, you can spend money contacting these people until the 24th, and then they will no longer be available.
[00:08:36.656 --> 00:08:40.199]  The documents, the screenshots, they're all on Infowars.com.
[00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.760]  I'm going to have it retweeted out at RealAlexJones.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.142]  Facebook preparing to ban conservatives
[00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:53.481]  Before midterm election, social media giant ramping up infomercial censorship to gain control of the narrative.
[00:08:53.541 --> 00:09:00.726]  This is massive violation of the First Amendment, massive political racketeering, incredible fraud.
[00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:05.870]  You think Hillary rigging the debates and getting the questions beforehand and all the fake polls was bad.
[00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.511]  This is next level.
[00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:09.373]  When GOP governor candidate
[00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:19.524]  This other story on InfoWars.com tried to reach out to our listeners and send them a video of him and his deportation bus that he's got as a stunt.
[00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:22.146]  He's current state Senator Michael Williams.
[00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:29.550]  They were told, we've got this letter right here, you are not allowed to advertise on this list of groups.
[00:09:31.412 --> 00:09:32.913]  And it lists them all right here.
[00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:41.746]  Ben Carson, Ann Coulter, Andrew Breitbart, still has his personal page on there, Bill O'Reilly, Alex Jones.
[00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:44.428]  That's just one guy.
[00:09:44.448 --> 00:09:53.795]  I've got all the letters pouring in from Republicans and Libertarians and everybody else, and they're like, yeah, they're telling us we're not able to contact your people.
[00:09:54.821 --> 00:10:01.283]  Because the media spun it like, oh, if Republicans contact people on Facebook, through Facebook, and Facebook makes money, that's dirty and bad.
[00:10:01.823 --> 00:10:04.723]  The Democrats do it 10 to 1, they brag.
[00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.204]  They brag, we own Facebook.
[00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:08.344]  They force feed it.
[00:10:08.664 --> 00:10:10.025]  Democrats don't even have to pay.
[00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:15.746]  But now they're telling Republicans, your money
[00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:18.644]  is not accepted here.
[00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:19.785]  Get out of our business.
[00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:20.786]  We're not baking your cake.
[00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:22.008]  We're not cutting your hair.
[00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:23.289]  We're not selling you a shirt.
[00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.311]  We're not feeding you food at the lunch counter.
[00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:27.233]  You don't get to sit at the back of the bus.
[00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:30.317]  You get your Republican butt off that bus!
[00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:32.979]  We don't care if you're black.
[00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:34.000]  We don't care if you're white.
[00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:39.987]  If you're a nationalist, a free market person, a conservative, get your butt off this bus now.
[00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:46.355]  I love how even The Hill, who'd make fun of me a year ago saying that censorship was here, now they got headlines.
[00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:49.297]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, admit censoring conservatives.
[00:10:49.957 --> 00:10:52.459]  This is massive, and it's not their own companies.
[00:10:52.499 --> 00:10:59.363]  They advertise, come here, be part of it, follow the rules, you send everybody the traffic, it becomes the internet, and then they cut you off.
[00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:04.567]  And then lie about you and call you a racist or an extremist while they do it.
[00:11:06.496 --> 00:11:19.043]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, Paul Joseph Watson put out a viral video exposing the race war anti-white narrative of the Childish Gambino as the answer to the love and what was being put out by Kanye West.
[00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:26.207]  He didn't show any of the violence, any of what they showed in the video that's not being censored, that's got 120 million views by Childish Gambino.
[00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:30.750]  But Paul's was censored for, quote, showing violence and blocked.
[00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:35.274]  We're again re-uploading it to a few other places right now.
[00:11:35.314 --> 00:11:36.735]  I'm sure they'll try to knock it down as well.
[00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:38.976]  But this is where they're trying to kill discourse.
[00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:40.918]  Now, I'm done talking about the censorship for now.
[00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:41.658]  Paul's coming up.
[00:11:41.718 --> 00:11:44.000]  But this is bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.160]  It's bigger than Breitbart.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.361]  It's bigger than Drudge Report.
[00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:47.662]  It's bigger than America.
[00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:50.324]  We have censorship in China emanating out.
[00:11:50.364 --> 00:11:51.765]  We have Apple moving over there.
[00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:54.606]  We have massive censorship intensifying across the world.
[00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:58.309]  We have church bells aren't allowed to ring in Germany and Sweden.
[00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:02.267]  That's in mainstream news?
[00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:06.931]  But the Muslims can blast their call to prayer at full power?
[00:12:07.752 --> 00:12:09.914]  All over they're passing Sharia law in Europe?
[00:12:09.994 --> 00:12:12.496]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:12:14.618 --> 00:12:20.223]  Swedish city allows 110 DB Muslim prayer calls, rejects church clock ringing.
[00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:27.349]  That's a EuropeWars.com article right now linking to mainstream news.
[00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:31.468]  And the only mainstream news covering it is the Russians, because they're pro-Christian now.
[00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.871]  The Irish Times did it too.
[00:12:36.612 --> 00:12:38.433]  Now, let's get into this.
[00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:40.034]  Wait until you hear this, speaking of the Irish.
[00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:42.396]  Just to give you a picture of how this ties together.
[00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:55.547]  Irish pressured to house migrants, North African and Islamic invaders, in spare bedrooms, vacation homes, just like Italy, where they throw all the people out of a little hotel on the seaside and say, we're not paying you now.
[00:12:56.388 --> 00:12:57.849]  And the federal police put
[00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:01.683]  The North Africans into their homes.
[00:13:01.723 --> 00:13:03.424]  This is a planned takeover.
[00:13:03.444 --> 00:13:05.945]  They want to advertise, come to Europe, everything's free.
[00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:12.148]  That's on europewars.com as well.
[00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:17.211]  Our new Europe Bureau, that's a Dan Lyman story, linking to mainstream European news, announcing it.
[00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:18.491]  And that ties into this.
[00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:21.233]  No lights allowed day!
[00:13:23.632 --> 00:13:26.993]  continues at Evergreen College despite last year's uproar.
[00:13:27.413 --> 00:13:30.735]  That's right, no whites are going to be allowed this Saturday at the school.
[00:13:31.195 --> 00:13:33.396]  Any professors that complain will be fired.
[00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:37.397]  The only whites allowed are the white communists controlling the whole operation.
[00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:43.079]  Oh, by the way, four socialists won primaries.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.580]  It doesn't matter because they're women, so it's okay.
[00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:48.321]  In Pennsylvania.
[00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:50.642]  That's right.
[00:13:52.113 --> 00:13:53.634]  Look at Venezuela collapsing.
[00:13:53.654 --> 00:13:54.935]  Look at every other socialist country collapsing.
[00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:55.415]  They don't care.
[00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:57.577]  Hip, hip, hooray.
[00:13:59.158 --> 00:14:01.760]  But these are all leftovers from the whole Bernie movement.
[00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:12.207]  So four socialist-backed candidates won Pennsylvania legislative primaries, showing you where the Democrats are, and they're running on a total socialist platform.
[00:14:12.928 --> 00:14:17.071]  But that's okay, because they're women, so don't criticize them for their horrible views.
[00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:27.317]  Well, I guess the dictator of Venezuela at least is a guy, so I can criticize him and people starving and a thousand dying a week, starvation, but that's okay.
[00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:30.761]  Crisis pours into Colombia across border bridge!
[00:14:32.807 --> 00:14:34.468]  That's out of the Bakersfield newspaper!
[00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:44.577]  And then now from South America, it's collapsing Central America, and Mexico's collapsing as millions migrate and flee collapsing communist and socialist countries.
[00:14:44.797 --> 00:14:45.798]  But that's okay!
[00:14:46.558 --> 00:14:48.240]  We can make it just like that here!
[00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:59.609]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting, we're having victories for capitalism and free speech, but America and a few other nations are the last stand here.
[00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:08.386]  And that's why it's more important than ever, please spread the word about the live broadcast on TV stations you're watching and radio stations you're listening to or the internet, InfoWars.com.
[00:15:08.747 --> 00:15:09.768]  We have our own streaming.
[00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:13.231]  We post some of our own videos at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:16.054]  And we're adding more of those features soon and working on that.
[00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:24.583]  We're making our exodus away, but we're still fighting to try to keep some freedom on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, because they've said when they're done shutting us down,
[00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:32.133]  On the wider web, Google's 90% of web searches, YouTube's 70% of video views.
[00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:34.656]  When they're done, they're coming to shut us down right here.
[00:15:35.057 --> 00:15:39.522]  Hell, Soros and Hillary and their lawyers are suing us right now saying they want us shut down.
[00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:43.867]  So we're fighting on every battlefield and every front we can place our feet on.
[00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:46.589]  Please also financially support us.
[00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:48.349]  We've got back on sale, back in stock.
[00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.710]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.911]  Why it's got thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:53.971]  The good halogen.
[00:15:54.032 --> 00:15:54.892]  It's back in stock.
[00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:56.572]  25% off for a limited time.

[00:15:59.253 --> 00:16:00.494]  But it's all about to stop.
[00:16:02.924 --> 00:16:03.504]  Alphapower.
[00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:04.684]  Here's what you want to know.
[00:16:04.904 --> 00:16:10.886]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[00:16:11.546 --> 00:16:15.087]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:23.909]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:27.830]  The average male or female enhancement
[00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.793]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:33.774]  It just has a little bit in it.
[00:16:34.135 --> 00:16:39.219]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:47.146]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:48.547]  We're good.
[00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:08.248]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:12.272]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:19.379]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:27.504]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:17:28.304 --> 00:17:33.547]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:46.293]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.054]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:53.375]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:55.096]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:18.186]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:30.079]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:41.470]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:47.215]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:50.799]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.781]  It's a 360 win.
[00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:56.264]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[00:18:56.644 --> 00:18:58.426]  You're helping to fight for freedom.
[00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:00.067]  So please go to the site now.
[00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:02.089]  We need your support.
[00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.300]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.801]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:09.222]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:09.582]  Yes.
[00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:10.763]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:10.863 --> 00:19:17.068]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.268 --> 00:19:21.251]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.492 --> 00:19:22.933]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:32.861]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:38.546]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:46.392]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.412 --> 00:19:52.237]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coalital Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.377 --> 00:19:57.681]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality coalital silver.
[00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:00.764]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:10.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.516 --> 00:20:19.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:36.553 --> 00:21:02.911]  So, why does George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the EU, the Vatican, and every other major globalist organization, Hollywood, the Communist Chinese, why do they all single Alex Jones out, Infowars out, and Paul Joseph Watson out, and say that we are to be shut down, and that we are scum, and that we are evil, and that we are bad people, when none of it's true?
[00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:11.911]  Because we have built a platform that reaches millions of people a day, but that's not what threatens them.
[00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:15.813]  The military, the police, and foreign governments listen.
[00:21:17.513 --> 00:21:24.336]  The intelligentsia listen because they know this is one of the only places you can tune in and actually hear real info that they already know.
[00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:29.077]  They already know we're telling the truth because they know more than we do in many cases.
[00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:30.738]  We told you
[00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:46.118]  Five years ago, that Hillary and Obama staged Benghazi to ship three warehouses of high-impact anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:49.840]  When that got exposed, we exposed it first, before anybody.
[00:21:51.381 --> 00:21:54.502]  Then Colonel Schaefer and others were able to expose it, leaving more intel.
[00:21:55.742 --> 00:21:57.583]  We got massively attacked for that.
[00:21:58.804 --> 00:22:00.965]  What do they list in the internal Google documents that have been leaked?
[00:22:00.985 --> 00:22:01.765]  Why do they want to shut us down?
[00:22:03.206 --> 00:22:04.147]  Because we expose that.
[00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:14.092]  We've gotten more footage of the Palestinians laying on the ground, pretending like they've been shot at a mass funeral with sheets over them, and then they take the sheets off and they get back up.
[00:22:14.112 --> 00:22:15.132]  I'm going to show that coming up.
[00:22:15.552 --> 00:22:19.134]  We take stuff that they don't want out, and we put it out.
[00:22:20.095 --> 00:22:21.956]  Does that mean I'm glad Palestinians have been shot?
[00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:25.457]  No, I'm not against the Palestinians, but most of the time it's fake!
[00:22:26.658 --> 00:22:27.759]  And that's what I'm tired of!
[00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:31.861]  And we have the proof, like they now admit the last chemical attack didn't even happen.
[00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:34.502]  Trump's cut the funding for the White Helmets.
[00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:36.202]  We've been totally proven right about that.
[00:22:37.203 --> 00:22:41.785]  That's why I got so mad when Trump bombed the base there over the lie!
[00:22:41.885 --> 00:22:42.905]  It's not true!
[00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:45.667]  But at least Trump now knows he got lied to.
[00:22:46.107 --> 00:22:47.087]  But let me give you the big news.
[00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:50.769]  I'm on the elliptical this morning at 8 o'clock.
[00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:53.367]  Fox News!
[00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:54.687]  Dun-dun-dun!
[00:22:54.787 --> 00:22:55.588]  Top story!
[00:22:55.968 --> 00:23:06.134]  We've interviewed the man who turned the weapons over, that he hadn't finished selling to Al-Qaeda, but it says he sold plane load after plane load that landed, and he would give it right to Al-Qaeda.
[00:23:07.495 --> 00:23:08.155]  Under U.S.
[00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:08.516]  orders.
[00:23:11.898 --> 00:23:13.419]  Oh, and guess where a lot of the weapons came through?
[00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:14.439]  Out of Mexico.
[00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:21.704]  We had Tosh Plumlee, who led squadrons of aircraft before he retired.
[00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:23.517]  Five years ago.
[00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:31.061]  Into Syria and into Iraq landing and the Wahhabis would come up to the plane.
[00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:33.622]  Yes, Tosh himself was flying some of these.
[00:23:35.242 --> 00:23:36.123]  For the CIA.
[00:23:36.403 --> 00:23:39.844]  Tosh has to live in a secret location in South America now.
[00:23:43.226 --> 00:23:43.706]  Oh!
[00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:43.706]  2013.
[00:23:43.846 --> 00:23:45.927]  Infowars.com.
[00:23:46.427 --> 00:23:49.909]  Former CIA pilot Plumlee says, and he goes through it all.
[00:23:51.482 --> 00:23:52.082]  Flashback.
[00:23:52.123 --> 00:23:55.385]  Hillary Clinton facilitated legal sales of arms to Al Qaeda.
[00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:55.385]  2016.
[00:23:56.186 --> 00:23:58.327]  The other one was 2013.
[00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:01.750]  Trump is right.
[00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.392]  Here's the proof Hillary and Obama founded ISIS.
[00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:06.173]  Infowars.com.
[00:24:06.233 --> 00:24:06.773]  Kit Daniels.
[00:24:06.994 --> 00:24:08.154]  But those are all two years ago.
[00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:10.436]  Guys, search engine Tosh Plumlee.
[00:24:11.057 --> 00:24:11.977]  Infowars.com.
[00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:12.398]  Show them the 2013, 2014, 2015.
[00:24:12.478 --> 00:24:13.358]  The videos, the articles then.
[00:24:13.378 --> 00:24:14.219]  That's the really powerful ones.
[00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:14.599]  Word for word.
[00:24:21.854 --> 00:24:23.176]  That's what is now Fox News.
[00:24:24.918 --> 00:24:26.019]  There it is.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:35.030]  2013, November 1st, former CIA pilot, and he was by the way still a pilot at the time, says Reagan administration responsible for death of DEA agent.
[00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.053]  And you read deeper into the article, because that's not the one.
[00:24:38.274 --> 00:24:39.695]  It's another one that came out right after that.
[00:24:40.418 --> 00:24:50.564]  You know, what happens is I get on the fly, all the listeners know we exposed this, they know Tosh Plumlee was on 15 times, they all know we exposed it, and then they're just in there randomly search-engineering other times he came on.
[00:24:50.825 --> 00:24:51.185]  Here it is.
[00:24:51.585 --> 00:24:56.148]  Former CIA whistleblower targeted by government over Facebook post, October 7th, 2013.
[00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:59.090]  Julie Wilson.
[00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.492]  And then it goes into the whole thing about Benghazi and all the rest of it.
[00:25:02.532 --> 00:25:07.075]  Yeah, the thing to search is CIA whistleblower Tosh Plumlee.
[00:25:09.688 --> 00:25:14.951]  Obama administration and Hillary Clinton shipped arms to Al Qaeda in Syria.
[00:25:15.332 --> 00:25:16.612]  That is the headline.
[00:25:17.153 --> 00:25:18.934]  You guys are just getting the Tosh Plumley search.
[00:25:19.174 --> 00:25:20.115]  You're getting some sub stuff.
[00:25:21.138 --> 00:25:21.959]  And there it all is.
[00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:23.100]  Gunrunner.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.920]  CIA Gunrunner.
[00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:27.583]  Hillary's Benghazi crimes confirmed.
[00:25:27.603 --> 00:25:27.583]  2015.
[00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:31.366]  Major whistleblower breaks down the current state of the country.
[00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:33.248]  And there's the whole article and the whole videos.
[00:25:33.268 --> 00:25:36.090]  There's a bunch of other ones exposing the entire thing.
[00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:37.251]  How it was done.
[00:25:37.271 --> 00:25:38.772]  How they shipped the weapons in.
[00:25:39.073 --> 00:25:41.295]  How they changed the name to ISIS to confuse people.
[00:25:41.575 --> 00:25:43.817]  How they were starting a Middle Eastern war.
[00:25:43.837 --> 00:25:45.238]  How she used the State Department.
[00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:56.262]  Export rule to block the ban, how they shipped in the weapons, what the NATO troops told him, what the special operations troops told him, what the other pilots told him, and what he saw with his own eyeballs.
[00:25:57.803 --> 00:26:00.104]  And they death-threaded him and everything else.
[00:26:00.704 --> 00:26:03.345]  So, you now want to know why they hate us?
[00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:12.249]  Because in 2018, dun-dun-dun, Bill Hemmer and the rest of the Fox News staff will tell you everything and give us no credit.
[00:26:13.956 --> 00:26:18.258]  Colonel Schaeffer went on in 2014 and 15 and said this stuff on Fox.
[00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:20.999]  But he said it on Fox Business on Lou Dobbs.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.841]  Oh, they let him say it, but only on Fox Business.
[00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:28.282]  They have him on regular Fox, but not to cover this stuff.
[00:26:28.862 --> 00:26:29.842]  You know, he works for Fox.
[00:26:31.583 --> 00:26:33.144]  And boy, does he get in trouble when he comes on here.
[00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:36.383]  So, that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:36.503 --> 00:26:41.668]  You got the information here four years before you got it anywhere else.
[00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:42.749]  Why are we under attack?
[00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:44.090]  Why are we being censored?
[00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.431]  Why are we being demonized?
[00:26:45.732 --> 00:26:46.693]  Why are we being sued?
[00:26:47.053 --> 00:26:48.014]  Why are we being lied about?
[00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:51.357]  Because we care about America and we're not rolling over to George Soros.
[00:26:51.817 --> 00:26:55.601]  And by the way, people always say, oh Alex, you know, you...
[00:26:58.106 --> 00:27:01.008]  Sit there and, you know, you act like George Soros is so powerful.
[00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:03.370]  Folks, every time I turn around, it's George Soros.
[00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:09.234]  You know, George Soros just bought control of Tesla.
[00:27:09.514 --> 00:27:11.216]  He'll have control of SpaceX next.
[00:27:12.477 --> 00:27:13.297]  And you know how he did it?
[00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:22.124]  They had the media badmouth Tesla and badmouth SpaceX and drive down the stocks billions and billions of dollars.
[00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:26.307]  And now Soros, the little doo-doo bird,
[00:27:27.642 --> 00:27:32.964]  Can come flapping in with only $35 million and leverage it and take control of the company.
[00:27:33.424 --> 00:27:36.005]  And then they spin it like, oh, he's buddies with Elon Musk.
[00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:39.686]  That's how you do it.
[00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:41.307]  He's involved in everything.
[00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:45.128]  You turn over any rock and that guy is waiting underneath it.
[00:27:45.188 --> 00:27:48.729]  Now, that said, Paul Joseph Watson is joining us on the massive censorship.
[00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:56.972]  I'm going to put out a video later, a special report, with the Tosh Plumley clips, with everything that was said, and then compare it to the Fox News report, how Hillary
[00:27:58.604 --> 00:28:06.869]  And Obama gave the orders to ship the heavy weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:08.370]  I gave the U.S.
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.651]  trucks and ammunition to Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:11.271]  U.S.
[00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:13.493]  equipment and weapons handed over to Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:15.394 --> 00:28:17.895]  And then it goes through the whole thing and how it happened.
[00:28:18.336 --> 00:28:18.936]  Oh my gosh.
[00:28:18.976 --> 00:28:20.277]  And this itself is a whitewash.
[00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:22.098]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:26.485]  The news from four years from now, today.
[00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:28.406]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.027]  Newswars.com.
[00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:31.628]  Europewars.com.
[00:28:31.908 --> 00:28:32.568]  Prisonplanet.com.
[00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:34.919]  That's why they hate us.
[00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:35.759]  That's why they're after us.
[00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:37.841]  Because we're on target and we'll tell the truth.
[00:28:38.321 --> 00:28:39.882]  And oh, and I'll say it again and again.
[00:28:40.483 --> 00:28:45.847]  George Soros said on 60 Minutes he was a Nazi collaborator and he was proud of it and he'd do it again.
[00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:55.495]  And that's why they got his PR firms out saying he never did such a thing and I'm a liar and in all these lawsuits they just list George Soros and that randomly as a message to me to shut up.
[00:28:55.755 --> 00:28:55.975]  No!
[00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:57.336]  You're a Nazi collaborator!
[00:28:57.456 --> 00:28:58.437]  You're a mass criminal!
[00:28:58.557 --> 00:28:59.578]  You overthrow countries!
[00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.039]  You're the enemy, George Soros!
[00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:02.060]  You're a piece of crap!
[00:29:05.953 --> 00:29:19.076]  Now, joining me is Phil Labonte from All That Remains, a band that I know that many InfoWars listeners, many Alex Jones fans are going to be huge, huge devotees to.
[00:29:19.797 --> 00:29:20.997]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:29:21.157 --> 00:29:32.060]  Now, you are not one of the singers, one of the members of the metal community who is advocating for gun control, and you're coming in for a bit of criticism as a result.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.800]  What happened to you?
[00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:37.905]  No, I do not advocate for gun control.
[00:29:39.525 --> 00:29:56.330]  In light of the Florida shooting, you know, a lot of people reacted emotionally, which is understandable, and there's a lot of people making calls for gun control, but they don't really elaborate what they're asking for.
[00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.811]  So I think that a lot of the breakdown between people that would
[00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:05.117]  Be considered on my side and people that would be considered on the other side.
[00:30:05.157 --> 00:30:07.720]  A lot of the breakdown is trying to understand each other.
[00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:18.613]  So I made a short video that was trying to explain why after these shootings there isn't just an instant law passed that'll just fix the problem in that
[00:30:19.904 --> 00:30:23.169]  If there is a law passed, that law is going to come with problems.
[00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:30.758]  And so I put up the video and there is a metal blog that has had an issue with me for a long time because I just won't go away apparently.
[00:30:33.086 --> 00:30:42.488]  20 years of being in the same band and 10 years of these guys dogging me because I won't stop making music is basically the history of it.
[00:30:42.648 --> 00:30:52.630]  You mean to tell me that the inflamed objections of social justice warriors have not been enough to turn you off your lifelong passion and your career?
[00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.170]  Good heavens!
[00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.951]  There's me thinking you would crumble and fall over like a pack of jokers!
[00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:11.881]  I do understand that there is a lot of pressure from the media, so there is a lot of social pressure to have the politically correct opinions.
[00:31:12.442 --> 00:31:23.731]  And when you're dealing with something like this particular shooting and guns in general, I think that it's hard to come up with an actual answer.
[00:31:24.372 --> 00:31:28.315]  So when you're kind of expected to say something on it,
[00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:30.467]  That's a good answer.
[00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:36.510]  It's really tough to be out there and have people asking you and talking about it and be like, palms up dude, I don't know.
[00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.050]  You know?
[00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.791]  Is that what they say?
[00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:40.231]  In the world?
[00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:41.032]  That's one of my favorites.
[00:31:41.052 --> 00:31:42.032]  Palms up dude, I don't know.
[00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:48.735]  I was just trying to help people understand why there hasn't been an immediate law after one of these terrible shootings.
[00:31:49.015 --> 00:31:52.416]  And it's not because people are callous or don't care.
[00:31:52.456 --> 00:31:54.377]  It's because it's not as simple as that.
[00:31:54.677 --> 00:31:59.219]  And as soon as you start talking about passing laws, you do run into the Constitution.
[00:32:03.158 --> 00:32:05.280]  It's just gonna get more twilight zone from here.
[00:32:11.486 --> 00:32:15.610]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:32:20.862 --> 00:32:30.385]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:32:30.505 --> 00:32:31.325]  It got ugly.
[00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:32.406]  Violence erupting at the event.
[00:32:32.426 --> 00:32:37.727]  A fight broke out, fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:32:37.907 --> 00:32:42.529]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:43.509]  You want to fight?
[00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:47.090]  You better believe you've got to fight!
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.241]  You say he's not your president?
[00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:54.882]  Then you shouldn't be here!
[00:32:54.962 --> 00:32:58.344]  Those who have been bringing us together!
[00:32:58.364 --> 00:32:59.205]  You got that?
[00:32:59.565 --> 00:33:02.167]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:33:05.849 --> 00:33:08.471]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:25.617]  Big Brother.
[00:33:25.657 --> 00:33:26.898]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:27.458 --> 00:33:28.578]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:29.338 --> 00:33:30.799]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:32.179]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.699 --> 00:33:37.401]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:51.076]  Well, you get tomorrow's news today here at InfoWars.com with Tosh Plumlee, one of the CIA men flying the aircraft.
[00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:55.018]  And then, who else should we have on?
[00:33:55.198 --> 00:34:04.142]  Oh, that's right, Colonel Schaefer saying that Benghazi was an arms deal gone bad and that Hillary wanted three warehouses shipped in to where?
[00:34:05.183 --> 00:34:05.743]  Syria.
[00:34:06.363 --> 00:34:08.084]  Well, Fox News Today.
[00:34:09.397 --> 00:34:12.918]  This morning broke it in a big, long, 10-page article.
[00:34:14.038 --> 00:34:14.839]  I gave the U.S.
[00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:19.340]  trucks and ammunition to Al Qaeda, and the weapons came out of Libya.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.841]  And it's all right there for everybody.
[00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:24.481]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:25.842]  Well, guess what?
[00:34:25.902 --> 00:34:28.582]  We talked to the very people that flew it all in.
[00:34:29.963 --> 00:34:30.743]  The TOW missiles.
[00:34:32.983 --> 00:34:33.784]  The anti-tank.
[00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:34.464]  The SAWs.
[00:34:35.762 --> 00:34:36.562]  The machine guns.
[00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:37.942]  The anti-aircraft.
[00:34:38.502 --> 00:34:39.123]  And guess what?
[00:34:39.423 --> 00:34:39.923]  Here it is!
[00:34:40.623 --> 00:34:41.923]  Infowars.com!
[00:34:42.903 --> 00:34:51.205]  An Alex Jones Curt Nemo story confirmed Benghazi was cover-up of arms transfer to Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:53.425]  Oh my gosh!
[00:34:53.545 --> 00:34:55.325]  That's four plus years ago!
[00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:57.486]  August 4th, 2013!
[00:34:58.386 --> 00:35:00.046]  That's almost four and a half years ago.
[00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:02.487]  We broke that exclusively.
[00:35:02.907 --> 00:35:04.127]  Like we do so much more.
[00:35:04.912 --> 00:35:19.202]  Like, oh, those questions are staged to Hillary in those CNN debates because she was instantly ready and smiling and you could tell going from memory and I could just, and it all, of course, all came out.
[00:35:19.362 --> 00:35:20.583]  I just said, look staged.
[00:35:21.104 --> 00:35:27.428]  I could look at her town halls and I could tell they were shot in like 80 millimeter or the best HD I've ever seen.
[00:35:27.508 --> 00:35:29.470]  I mean, you can tell a movie.
[00:35:30.971 --> 00:35:32.672]  You could see pieces of dust in the air.
[00:35:34.836 --> 00:35:38.363]  And it came out a month later in WikiLeaks that it was a totally staged event.
[00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:41.188]  See, I can look at something and see it's fake.
[00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.752]  They call that being a conspiracy theorist.
[00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:45.515]  But when you actually have...
[00:35:47.105 --> 00:35:49.788]  The witnesses who flew the aircraft.
[00:35:49.808 --> 00:35:51.950]  By the way, folks, Tosh Plumlee risked his life.
[00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.612]  They tried to basically come and get him.
[00:35:53.632 --> 00:35:56.294]  I'm not supposed to talk about it on air, but he left for South America.
[00:35:57.135 --> 00:36:01.059]  And he's staying with some old friends down there from his old CIA days.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.161]  But they're trying to kill him.
[00:36:04.042 --> 00:36:04.723]  And he's a hero.
[00:36:08.283 --> 00:36:10.344]  So, that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:10.384 --> 00:36:10.945]  There it is.
[00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:11.445]  Boom!
[00:36:11.825 --> 00:36:13.026]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:36:13.746 --> 00:36:15.227]  Why they hate us.
[00:36:15.247 --> 00:36:18.549]  We've got to take those original interviews of Plumlee in 2013 and re-air them.
[00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:25.654]  I mean, it is just incredible what criminals Hillary and Obama were when Trump then said they were the founders of ISIS.
[00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:29.576]  That is 100% totally true.
[00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:33.198]  Now, we're going to Paul Watson here in just a moment.
[00:36:33.218 --> 00:36:35.900]  We're going to air his censored video when we come back.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.540]  This is big.
[00:36:36.581 --> 00:36:37.261]  This is important.
[00:36:39.073 --> 00:36:40.614]  Because the crackdown is now happening.
[00:36:42.355 --> 00:36:42.735]  Briefly.
[00:36:43.175 --> 00:36:43.856]  Financially.
[00:36:43.956 --> 00:36:44.816]  We need your support.
[00:36:44.896 --> 00:36:45.977]  They've taken the sponsors.
[00:36:46.177 --> 00:36:47.177]  Local Radio has sponsors.
[00:36:47.197 --> 00:36:47.558]  That's great.
[00:36:47.578 --> 00:36:48.058]  Support them.
[00:36:48.338 --> 00:36:49.499]  The network has their sponsors.
[00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:52.500]  But we are 80 plus percent funded by you buying products.
[00:36:53.981 --> 00:36:55.102]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:55.122 --> 00:36:56.803]  We have great ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:36:57.523 --> 00:36:58.544]  95% turmeric level.
[00:36:58.564 --> 00:36:59.464]  Leading competitors have 3%.
[00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:01.765]  Amazing what turmeric does.
[00:37:02.066 --> 00:37:03.806]  Has five other superfoods in it as well.
[00:37:03.927 --> 00:37:04.527]  Supercharge it.
[00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:10.734]  So six super herbs, strongest tumor you're going to find out there, the most concentrated.
[00:37:12.406 --> 00:37:15.227]  It's 50% off, because I want you to try it and see how amazing it is.
[00:37:15.307 --> 00:37:17.408]  It sold out last time I did this in two weeks.
[00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.409]  I want you to see how great body it is.
[00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:24.391]  It came back in, sold out for a week, but we got an emergency supply of X2, the good halogen.
[00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.432]  It is 25% off, even though it is going to sell out soon.
[00:37:28.812 --> 00:37:31.893]  Our great fluoride-free toothpaste in 4 to 5 cloyal silver and iodine.
[00:37:32.274 --> 00:37:36.895]  It's 50% off for adults, children, the mouthwash, and the immune gargles in three sizes.
[00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:39.676]  All six products in the super blue line, 50% off.
[00:37:41.437 --> 00:37:46.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, makes it easy for you to take care of yourself and your family and fund the operation.
[00:37:46.298 --> 00:37:48.439]  You'll read the thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:56.121]  No reviews yet on the Big Five Combo Pack, or the Big Six Combo Pack, because it's brand new, but that also has free shipping on that Combo Pack.
[00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.042]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:38:00.482 --> 00:38:03.303]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us to break down
[00:38:04.963 --> 00:38:12.008]  The admitted total crackdown on libertarian conservative Christian nationalist speech all over the world being led by big tech.
[00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:20.815]  Congressional hearings months ago calling for Watson to be banned from Twitter because he dare say that the Muslim attacker with a truck in New York was a Muslim.
[00:38:20.855 --> 00:38:21.775]  That was of course true.
[00:38:22.616 --> 00:38:27.900]  So his crime is saying the sky is blue at high noon and that the woods are lovely dark and deep.
[00:38:32.108 --> 00:38:33.068]  The truth will out.
[00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:42.610]  Now, there's a number one music video out there, and Paul Watson devastates it, coming up when we air this in the next segment, but I wanted him to specifically speak to this.
[00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.071]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:49.052]  We have re-uploaded it from Facebook, so you can see the censored video for a limited time.
[00:38:49.072 --> 00:38:50.232]  We'll probably take that down.
[00:38:50.652 --> 00:39:00.234]  YouTube allows video description of Massacre to be watched by children, but when we criticize it, they censor the video, criticizing it that censors the violence.
[00:39:00.714 --> 00:39:11.426]  So this is exposing them, targeting children with this race-baiting, race-war, violent garbage, and blocking it from most audiences, but not blocking the actual violence and race-baiting.
[00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:16.111]  So, total hypocrisy, total fraud, and then it dovetails in with everything else.
[00:39:16.371 --> 00:39:17.332]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[00:39:17.352 --> 00:39:19.455]  Give us an update on this.
[00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:25.672]  Well, the update is literally five minutes ago they restored it, which always happens, right?
[00:39:25.932 --> 00:39:27.693]  We always make a big deal out of it.
[00:39:28.093 --> 00:39:30.293]  Point to the fact that this is the Streisand effect.
[00:39:30.353 --> 00:39:33.574]  They still seem completely unaware of what the Streisand effect is.
[00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:36.795]  Then it ends up getting hundreds of thousands of more views anyway.
[00:39:37.035 --> 00:39:39.136]  So it always fails, but they keep doing it.
[00:39:39.496 --> 00:39:41.616]  And we've got a platform to kind of push back.
[00:39:41.676 --> 00:39:42.377]  Most people don't.
[00:39:42.437 --> 00:39:43.637]  Most people just accept it.
[00:39:44.187 --> 00:39:48.330]  The video is basically the US Billboard number one hit song right now.
[00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:53.934]  It shows, it depicts, in bloody gore and violence, somebody being shot in the head.
[00:39:54.414 --> 00:39:58.037]  A group of gospel singers being massacred with an AK-47.
[00:39:58.597 --> 00:40:00.338]  YouTube didn't age restrict it.
[00:40:00.378 --> 00:40:00.799]  No, no, no.
[00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:03.881]  They promoted it on their trending page for the past 10 days.
[00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.662]  There's no age restriction.
[00:40:05.722 --> 00:40:06.742]  Children can watch this.
[00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:08.864]  And it's advertiser friendly.
[00:40:09.264 --> 00:40:10.825]  Now, I don't really care, Alex.
[00:40:11.025 --> 00:40:12.946]  I don't support censorship in any faction.
[00:40:13.366 --> 00:40:15.027]  But it's the double standard.
[00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:16.908]  So I put up a video last night
[00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:27.957]  Criticizing this video, the message behind it, because the Washington Post, Inside Edition, The View, they all put their videos on YouTube, fawning over it and praising it.
[00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:29.959]  Basically, it trashes America.
[00:40:29.979 --> 00:40:32.160]  It's, you know, the usual Black Lives Matter rhetoric.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.002]  America's racist, evil, and corrupt.
[00:40:35.562 --> 00:40:46.529]  It allows Donald Glover, the creator of this video, to become an international actor, music star, and be on all the top TV shows every night for the past two weeks because America's so evil and racist.
[00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:51.425]  So I basically made some points rebutting... And he's going to be Lando Calrissian in the new movie.
[00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:52.409]  It's just so horrible.
[00:40:53.086 --> 00:40:53.306]  Yeah.
[00:40:53.867 --> 00:40:54.487]  So horrible.
[00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:55.128]  Yeah.
[00:40:55.408 --> 00:41:02.093]  He's literally like the most adored, famous person on Earth, but America's racist and hates black people, apparently.
[00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:05.475]  So I made a video about it, criticizing the message behind it.
[00:41:05.815 --> 00:41:17.064]  Within hours, it was put behind what they call the Gulag, which is when a video starts to go viral, they immediately shut it down, prevent comments, prevent likes, prevent it from being shared.
[00:41:17.324 --> 00:41:19.446]  You have to be signed into a YouTube account to watch it.
[00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:22.448]  Basically kills any traction the video has.
[00:41:23.149 --> 00:41:34.054]  So, understand the fact that the Washington Post and all these other outlets have had their videos on YouTube for days, praising the original video, that's fine.
[00:41:34.354 --> 00:41:49.000]  As soon as I criticize it with my opinion, and don't even show the violence which is in the original, I literally censored the violence which is not censored in the original, which is available for children to watch and is advertiser friendly.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.321]  So within about 12 hours,
[00:41:51.647 --> 00:41:53.109]  It got nearly 200,000 views.
[00:41:53.529 --> 00:41:54.270]  It was shut down.
[00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.191]  It was censored.
[00:41:55.872 --> 00:42:01.638]  Now, obviously, we've got some kind of resources to draw attention to this and to freak out about it.
[00:42:01.678 --> 00:42:04.101]  So it's just been restored as of about 10 minutes ago.
[00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.123]  But again, it goes back to the point
[00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:07.982]  There's this narrative, Alex.
[00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:13.104]  Oh, the conservative snowflakes are complaining about being censored again.
[00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:14.244]  What are you talking about?
[00:42:14.284 --> 00:42:15.265]  You're never censored.
[00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:19.187]  Literally within hours of me making this video, boom, censored.
[00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.268]  So yes, we are being censored.
[00:42:22.068 --> 00:42:22.548]  That's a lie.
[00:42:41.318 --> 00:42:47.805]  We're gonna play the censored video that's now been put back up for now, which they killed when it started going megaviral.
[00:42:48.086 --> 00:42:49.407]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:49.427 --> 00:42:52.491]  We're gonna retweet it right now at RealAlexJones and at Prison Planet.
[00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:53.131]  Paul's Twitter.
[00:42:53.332 --> 00:42:54.853]  Paul, please tweet that it's been restored.
[00:42:55.214 --> 00:42:56.435]  See it while it's still available.
[00:42:56.455 --> 00:42:57.897]  And then we're gonna talk about the next level.
[00:42:58.157 --> 00:43:00.900]  Facebook is announcing the end of InfoWars May 24th.
[00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:09.168]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:09.848 --> 00:43:11.648]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.229 --> 00:43:18.090]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.131]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:24.452]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:24.812 --> 00:43:30.714]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:37.897]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.217 --> 00:43:44.119]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.161]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:56.867]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.268 --> 00:44:03.513]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:04.554 --> 00:44:08.975]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[00:44:09.615 --> 00:44:17.716]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.276 --> 00:44:19.937]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:27.398]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this, because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:32.899]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:45.708]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:48.351]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:49.091 --> 00:44:56.555]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[00:44:56.575 --> 00:44:57.456]  They used to make drugs.
[00:44:57.476 --> 00:44:58.977]  That's why the FDA is involved.
[00:44:59.617 --> 00:45:01.638]  And that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:02.058 --> 00:45:06.761]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:07.341 --> 00:45:10.903]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.184 --> 00:45:15.066]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:18.387]  So, we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:18.427 --> 00:45:19.547]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.328]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:21.768 --> 00:45:24.049]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:27.310]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.131]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:33.732]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:35.432]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:45:35.792 --> 00:45:43.154]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:44.315]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:45.095]  Yeah.
[00:46:00.052 --> 00:46:00.933]  I don't think so.
[00:46:16.502 --> 00:46:16.662]  That's
[00:46:36.525 --> 00:46:38.626]  Set before a non-zero sum game.
[00:46:38.946 --> 00:46:47.268]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at Infowarslife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:46:47.828 --> 00:46:52.149]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:46:52.569 --> 00:46:59.131]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:47:06.883 --> 00:47:09.704]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.504 --> 00:47:23.089]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:29.891]  We now take you live
[00:47:31.118 --> 00:47:36.982]  To reality, we now take you live to the Central Texas Global Command Center for the Human Awakening.
[00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:40.985]  This is the Paul Joseph Watson transmission.
[00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:48.911]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:49.351 --> 00:47:51.633]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:53.018 --> 00:47:56.782]  What headline did I run yesterday at InfoWars.com on the live feeds?
[00:47:57.884 --> 00:48:03.450]  Ergun announces global caliphate against Israel, America and the EU.
[00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:06.473]  What is the headline that he officially said today?
[00:48:06.873 --> 00:48:08.155]  GrudgeReport.com please.
[00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:09.476]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:48:09.877 --> 00:48:10.878]  Please put it back on screen for me.
[00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:15.399]  Ergun urges Islamic world to unite against Israel.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.201]  Actually, he said more than that.
[00:48:17.641 --> 00:48:18.902]  Because he said it before.
[00:48:19.423 --> 00:48:22.465]  And when he pulled his people out of the Israel and U.S.
[00:48:22.545 --> 00:48:26.569]  embassies, that signaled he's going to really take the mask off.
[00:48:28.277 --> 00:48:29.137]  So there you go.
[00:48:29.398 --> 00:48:30.938]  Back to Paul Watson, Paul.
[00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:37.481]  We're going to play this video and come back with five more minutes of you to react to Facebook's announcement that we'll be removed the 24th.
[00:48:37.521 --> 00:48:38.341]  That's what it says.
[00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:40.022]  This is just spectacular.
[00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:43.183]  They also say Breitbart will be and others and culture.
[00:48:43.544 --> 00:48:46.665]  But just before we play this Gambino piece in one minute, other points.
[00:48:48.228 --> 00:48:55.953]  Yeah, the other point is, this video is based on the premise that the entertainment industry and the media distracts people from real issues.
[00:48:55.994 --> 00:49:05.060]  What they call real issues are identity politics, racism, Black Lives Matter rhetoric, which of course is all the entertainment industry media talks about.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.704]  Every awards show, NFL, late night comedy monologues, that's all they talk about.
[00:49:10.984 --> 00:49:13.506]  So they're not distracting from it, they're promoting it.
[00:49:13.966 --> 00:49:15.927]  So, I mean, I drew attention to this.
[00:49:15.967 --> 00:49:21.130]  You know, the guy behind this video is on every major TV talk show, has been for the past two weeks.
[00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.212]  So, the video itself distracts from real issues.
[00:49:25.652 --> 00:49:28.314]  I brought up real issues in the actual video.
[00:49:28.634 --> 00:49:35.898]  Like, if you really care about black lives, shouldn't the fact that 90% of black people are killed by other black people be part of that conversation?
[00:49:36.118 --> 00:49:37.779]  They can't deal with the real debate.
[00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:41.562]  They're force feeding this narrative with hundreds of movies, TV shows, trying to cause a race war.
[00:49:41.582 --> 00:49:42.383]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:49:42.603 --> 00:49:44.645]  We'll be back in a moment after the censored video.
[00:49:44.685 --> 00:49:44.985]  Here it is.
[00:49:55.658 --> 00:49:56.219]  This is America.
[00:49:56.379 --> 00:49:59.443]  Why am I analysing This is America by Childish Gambino?
[00:49:59.483 --> 00:50:05.670]  Because millions upon millions of people have blithely swallowed the social justice narrative that it promotes.
[00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.213]  They're calling it an overnight cultural phenomenon.
[00:50:08.273 --> 00:50:13.439]  This video is basically the antidote to everything Kanye has been saying for the past few weeks.
[00:50:13.459 --> 00:50:14.440]  Now first off, I'm not.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.789]  I'm not questioning the talents of either Donald Glover or the choreography for this video, which are both obviously substantial.
[00:50:20.909 --> 00:50:26.537]  I am questioning the phony, race-baiting, divisive narrative that the video seeks to elevate.
[00:50:26.597 --> 00:50:31.444]  So Donald Glover, Childish Gambino, is essentially playing the role of America.
[00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:33.985]  White America, to be more precise.
[00:50:34.045 --> 00:50:39.729]  Glover massacring the gospel singers is a reference to the racist murder of black churchgoers in Charleston.
[00:50:39.769 --> 00:50:50.796]  The guy shot at the beginning of the video also looks like Trayvon Martin's dad, cementing the Black Lives Matter theme that racist white America is hunting down African Americans.
[00:50:51.036 --> 00:50:58.621]  Strangely, absent from the four-minute video is any reference whatsoever to the number one killer of black people in America, which is...
[00:50:59.281 --> 00:51:00.322]  Other black people.
[00:51:00.442 --> 00:51:05.585]  A fact you'd think would be part of the conversation if Glover really cared about black lives.
[00:51:05.725 --> 00:51:15.071]  Also absent is the fact that black people kill more white people than vice versa, despite the fact that white people make up a far larger percentage of the population.
[00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:23.475]  According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, in 2010, 62,593 blacks were the victims of white violence.
[00:51:23.835 --> 00:51:29.058]  During that same year, 320,082 whites were the victims of black violence.
[00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:35.481]  That's five times as many violent attacks, but that number is misleading, since the black and white populations are not the same size.
[00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:49.532]  When 38 million black Americans commit five times as many violent crimes on 197 million whites as they receive, what you discover is that black perpetrators violently assault white victims 25 times more frequently.
[00:51:49.812 --> 00:51:57.038]  And when it comes to a specific kind of violent crime, aggravated assault, the number of black-on-white crimes is 200 times higher than white-on-black crimes.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:14.511]  Running through the lyrics and the entire video is the theme of Glover and the dancers serving as a distraction from the chaos going on behind them, which is supposed to be an allegory of how entertainment distracts from social justice, racism, and identity politics.
[00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:20.532]  The song's first bridge talks about how entertainment media is serving as a distraction from bigger issues at hand.
[00:52:20.612 --> 00:52:21.732]  What are you talking about?
[00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:28.274]  The entertainment industry is now wall-to-wall social justice, racism, and identity politics.
[00:52:28.314 --> 00:52:39.976]  You can't get through a late-night comedy monologue, an NFL national anthem, or an awards show speech without being bombarded with social justice, racism, and identity politics.
[00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:43.517]  This very video has handed the entertainment industry and the media
[00:52:43.877 --> 00:52:50.385]  Yet another opportunity to endlessly talk about social justice, racism, and identity politics.
[00:52:50.465 --> 00:52:55.271]  Mainstream America doesn't distract from discussions about racism and social justice.
[00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:58.876]  It amplifies them at every available opportunity.
[00:52:59.036 --> 00:53:08.946]  One of the dance moves Glover performs is the South African Gwara Gwara, to draw a parallel between the racist oppression of black people in South Africa and racism in America.
[00:53:09.006 --> 00:53:17.215]  Which is pretty ironic, given that racist oppression currently taking place in South Africa is overwhelmingly directed towards white people.
[00:53:17.295 --> 00:53:23.179]  The South African Parliament has voted in favour of new legislation that could see land from white farmers seized.
[00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:27.922]  He has said that he's not calling for the slaughter of white people, at least not yet.
[00:53:28.402 --> 00:53:33.566]  In recent years there has been a spike in the killing of farmers in South Africa.
[00:53:33.766 --> 00:53:41.011]  The guns being attentively taken care of with a red cloth represents how Republicans care more about guns than lives.
[00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:50.397]  Another irony, given that defensive gun uses by victims are more common than gun uses by violent criminals, according to the CDC's own figures.
[00:53:50.437 --> 00:53:56.361]  Firearms violence has also been plummeting for the last 20 years, even as gun ownership soared.
[00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:57.282]  Gambino says,
[00:53:58.268 --> 00:53:58.929]  This is Sally.
[00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:07.656]  Sally could mean cell block, a commonly used tool to unjustly keep blacks in a cycle of incarceration.
[00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:08.777]  Yeah.
[00:54:08.797 --> 00:54:11.299]  50% homicide rate, 13% population rate.
[00:54:11.319 --> 00:54:15.922]  Glover also poses and pulls facial expressions like a caricature of Jim Crow.
[00:54:16.102 --> 00:54:19.906]  Jim Crow laws were racial segregation laws enacted by...
[00:54:20.606 --> 00:54:29.032]  Democrats, and as Candace Owens points out, virtually no one complaining about Jim Crow laws today even lived through the Jim Crow era.
[00:54:29.072 --> 00:54:30.333]  Victim mentality is not cool.
[00:54:30.573 --> 00:54:32.254]  I don't know why people like being oppressed.
[00:54:32.274 --> 00:54:33.315]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
[00:54:33.575 --> 00:54:34.436]  I love oppression.
[00:54:34.756 --> 00:54:35.296]  We're oppressed.
[00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:36.437]  400 years of slavery.
[00:54:36.477 --> 00:54:36.877]  Jim Crow.
[00:54:37.077 --> 00:54:38.819]  Which, by the way, none of you guys lived through.
[00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:39.599]  Your grandparents did.
[00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:43.282]  And it's embarrassing that you utilize their history.
[00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.643]  You're not living through anything right now.
[00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:48.265]  You're overly privileged Americans.
[00:54:48.345 --> 00:54:52.109]  Racism and slavery was a horrific chapter of American history.
[00:54:52.149 --> 00:54:58.576]  Just as it was in every other part of the world where slavery was inflicted on virtually every race on the planet.
[00:54:58.656 --> 00:55:02.560]  Why are we still obsessively talking about this hundreds of years later?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.544]  Could it be because Democrats don't actually care about black lives?
[00:55:06.684 --> 00:55:12.809]  It has been a record year in the city of Chicago, and for all the wrong reasons, the murder rate has never been higher.
[00:55:12.889 --> 00:55:21.075]  And the only thing they actually care about is keeping black people locked in a permanent state of mental victimhood so they can get black votes.
[00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:30.662]  Glover trying to escape and run from America, which is represented at the end of the video, encapsulates the overarching nihilistic message that America is corrupt, evil.
[00:55:30.842 --> 00:55:31.483]  And racist!
[00:55:31.663 --> 00:55:39.732]  So corrupt, evil and racist that it allows Glover, a black man, to reach the top of his game in both acting and the music industry.
[00:55:39.772 --> 00:55:43.015]  While having one of the most celebrated and talked about songs of the year.
[00:55:43.075 --> 00:55:45.758]  While appearing on every mainstream talk show on TV.
[00:55:45.798 --> 00:55:48.321]  While making tens of millions of dollars in the process.
[00:55:48.681 --> 00:55:49.882]  So racist!
[00:55:50.022 --> 00:56:12.952]  America is so corrupt and evil, it defeated the twin terrors of fascism and communism, became the biggest economic powerhouse on the planet, created a strong aspirational middle class including a generation of upwardly mobile black families, improving the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans of all colors, and providing endless opportunities for tens of millions of immigrants thereafter.
[00:56:13.372 --> 00:56:14.572]  So racist!
[00:56:14.713 --> 00:56:16.473]  But none of that really matters.
[00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:21.095]  This music video has had over 120 million views in 10 days.
[00:56:21.215 --> 00:56:25.856]  Videos that emphasize its social justice narrative have tens of millions more views.
[00:56:25.976 --> 00:56:32.318]  This is a potent piece of cultural and political propaganda delivered via the medium of pop culture.
[00:56:32.378 --> 00:56:39.200]  And me sitting here debunking its delusory, sophisticated themes isn't going to reach 120 million people.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.281]  We need to create our own art.
[00:56:41.641 --> 00:56:43.522]  We need to create our own music.
[00:56:43.902 --> 00:56:47.303]  We need to create our own cultural narrative.
[00:56:47.343 --> 00:56:52.744]  Young people don't identify with social justice narratives because of their objective truth.
[00:56:52.904 --> 00:56:57.206]  They didn't reason themselves into believing Black Lives Matter rhetoric.
[00:56:57.326 --> 00:57:02.647]  They believe it because it's socially acceptable and it inflates their inherent narcissism.
[00:57:02.747 --> 00:57:05.488]  They identify with it because it's cool to do so.
[00:57:05.748 --> 00:57:08.649]  Videos like this make it cool to do so.
[00:57:08.709 --> 00:57:10.670]  We need to make this uncool.
[00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:14.791]  We need to make social justice the most embarrassing thing in the world.
[00:57:14.872 --> 00:57:22.594]  We need to create an environment where artists can express true diversity of opinion without committing career suicide.
[00:57:22.655 --> 00:57:31.618]  We need to incentivize a return to beauty, a return to authenticity, a reassertion of confidence in Western civilization.
[00:57:31.698 --> 00:57:32.899]  This isn't America.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.204]  Spike Lee's new America-bashing movie isn't America.
[00:57:37.304 --> 00:57:43.131]  This kind of thing exists to tear down and denigrate the very idea of America.
[00:57:43.231 --> 00:57:47.095]  We shouldn't allow this to define what America stands for.
[00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:49.538]  We need to define what America stands for.
[00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:52.001]  We need to make America cool.
[00:57:55.618 --> 00:57:57.460]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:57.781]  Go ahead.
[00:57:57.901 --> 00:58:01.785]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:58:01.925 --> 00:58:06.951]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:58:07.492 --> 00:58:11.356]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day.
[00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:22.104]  To your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:58:22.804 --> 00:58:25.686]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:58:26.367 --> 00:58:29.969]  I work nights, 12, 14 hours a night, five days a week.
[00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:36.914]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:58:37.074 --> 00:58:41.717]  I'm just here in California fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:58:42.157 --> 00:58:45.381]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:58:45.401 --> 00:58:50.367]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[00:58:50.887 --> 00:59:01.039]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water, my mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do!
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.201]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:08.726]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:59:08.746 --> 00:59:10.067]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:59:10.107 --> 00:59:10.267]  Yeah.
[00:59:10.427 --> 00:59:12.309]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:13.170]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:14.891]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:59:14.911 --> 00:59:15.892]  We really appreciate you.
[00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:16.953]  Keep up the fight.
[00:59:16.973 --> 00:59:18.394]  We need to take California back.
[00:59:18.414 --> 00:59:18.794]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:59:18.854 --> 00:59:19.895]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[00:59:19.935 --> 00:59:20.536]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:59:27.512 --> 00:59:36.275]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[00:59:36.695 --> 00:59:44.057]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:44.377 --> 00:59:46.498]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:56.749 --> 01:00:00.316]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.602]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:19.363 --> 01:00:20.843]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.544 --> 01:00:30.508]  Well, Paul Watson knocked it out of the park yet again in that powerful 8-minute video that they were censoring and blocking, but now because of pressure they've allowed back up.
[01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:37.692]  The truth about Childish Gambino's new movie.
[01:00:38.632 --> 01:00:39.973]  New little music video.
[01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.773]  Now again, Paul said one thing that wasn't true.
[01:00:43.813 --> 01:00:47.175]  He said, well obviously this video I'm putting out won't get 120 million views.
[01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:53.058]  Paul, I've produced documentaries that have been seen 200 million times online.
[01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:56.460]  I've had other films that have been seen 50, 60, 70 million times online.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.062]  These are two, three hour films like Loose Change, Obama Deception, Endgame.
[01:01:01.223 --> 01:01:04.525]  You, on your own Facebook channel, hit the site guys during the election.
[01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:09.568]  You had videos with 37 million views, 25 million views, but they deleted them.
[01:01:10.302 --> 01:01:13.043]  When you get 37 million views in a week, it's going to keep going forever.
[01:01:15.043 --> 01:01:19.464]  But I love this guy in all these top movies, reportedly already made like $50 million.
[01:01:20.184 --> 01:01:23.345]  Childish Gambino, bitching where he's running from America.
[01:01:23.365 --> 01:01:27.966]  Hey, please run to South Africa or run to Venezuela and go eat dogs and cats.
[01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:28.926]  I guess they already ate all those.
[01:01:29.306 --> 01:01:30.066]  Run to North Korea.
[01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:31.566]  Just stop the bitching, man.
[01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:35.027]  I didn't do jack crap to you, you rich Hollywood person.
[01:01:35.927 --> 01:01:38.488]  And I resent all your endless race bait and crap.
[01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:41.239]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:01:41.259 --> 01:01:46.424]  I mean, I know 12 to 1, it'll be a black guy shoots me or robs me for every time a white guy does that.
[01:01:46.525 --> 01:01:49.127]  I know the numbers, because it's open season on white people.
[01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:49.668]  It's pushed.
[01:01:50.088 --> 01:01:51.549]  That doesn't mean I blame all black people.
[01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:59.697]  I'm a racist like he is, but Spike Lee and all these guys are nothing but dirtbag, chip-on-their-shoulder racists who wear this like some type of crown, Paul.
[01:01:59.978 --> 01:02:01.159]  Other points you want to make about this?
[01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:07.540]  There's a photo today of an African American woman hugging Trump from behind.
[01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:12.106]  Her daughter was shot in the line of duty, you know, a black woman.
[01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:15.952]  So, I mean, all violence is bad, but the fact is, I think the figure is
[01:02:16.664 --> 01:02:25.826]  Cops are 18.5 times more likely to be shot by a black criminal than an unarmed black man is likely to be shot by a cop.
[01:02:26.306 --> 01:02:34.188]  So obviously all violence is bad, we want to reduce it as much as possible, but this whole narrative that African Americans are being hunted down, just not true!
[01:02:34.628 --> 01:02:38.649]  It's not true by any benchmark, any statistic.
[01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.410]  The other fact of the matter, Alex, is
[01:02:42.088 --> 01:02:46.660]  You know, you talked about Facebook and possibly InfoWars being banned on Facebook from May 24th.
[01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:49.691]  It's all about the algorithm, Alex.
[01:02:50.832 --> 01:02:58.659]  80% reduction in engagement rate on one of my Facebook pages alone, the one linked to InfoWars, over the past 10 days alone.
[01:02:59.019 --> 01:03:00.521]  It went down even further before that.
[01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:05.885]  You know, I used to put up videos on Facebook that could get like 300,000, 400,000 views overnight.
[01:03:06.165 --> 01:03:07.566]  Now it's like, sometimes it's like 40,000.
[01:03:09.288 --> 01:03:15.193]  They're listing websites and demoting websites based on their algorithm and they admitted to it.
[01:03:15.982 --> 01:03:19.583]  So all this whining about YouTube, this is not even the biggest issue.
[01:03:19.623 --> 01:03:21.463]  The biggest issue is the algorithm.
[01:03:21.803 --> 01:03:24.724]  Facebook's now saying, oh, we're going to rank it on trustworthiness.
[01:03:25.204 --> 01:03:28.565]  InfoWars.com, BrightBar.com, they're going to be on the blacklist.
[01:03:29.185 --> 01:03:34.846]  I post InfoWars articles on Facebook with, you know, like a million combined followers on my pages.
[01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:37.147]  They get like 10, 20 shares.
[01:03:37.407 --> 01:03:41.928]  You can post a meme, it'll get 30,000 shares because they can't list it.
[01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:45.349]  They can't blacklist it because there's no InfoWars.com link.
[01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.031]  So that's the bigger issue.
[01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:56.244]  That's what we need people in Congress asking them questions about, as Ted Cruz did to some extent, but we need more of that to happen for this to be changed.
[01:03:58.012 --> 01:04:05.794]  And it's incredible how they're just doing it, and then lying about us, while the Democrats sue everybody, trying to shut them physically down.
[01:04:06.154 --> 01:04:08.355]  This is hardcore authoritarianism, Paul.
[01:04:08.615 --> 01:04:17.558]  What do you make out of the statement that they sent out saying, Infowars will no longer be allowed to be contacted, and will no longer be here, will no longer be available.
[01:04:17.898 --> 01:04:22.019]  And of course, we make no money off them letting Republicans contact our listeners that are activists.
[01:04:23.602 --> 01:04:28.726]  Facebook's saying we're not even gonna make money off this, which sounds to me like we're just gonna be banned on the 24th of May.
[01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:37.033]  Well, I mean, that's that's possibly what it means, or at least means that, you know, people aren't gonna be able to associate with us with advertising.
[01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:43.218]  But listen, today's audience figures for CNN, they've lost 30% of their audience in a week.
[01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:44.379]  They're collapsing.
[01:04:44.399 --> 01:04:49.684]  That's why CNN was lobbying to shut down our YouTube channels, because they want to extinguish their competition.
[01:04:49.724 --> 01:04:51.305]  Paul, I know you gotta go, but you're on fire.
[01:04:51.325 --> 01:04:52.185]  I want to explain.
[01:04:52.446 --> 01:04:55.527]  Yeah, them shutting us down and killing free speech won't save them.
[01:04:55.947 --> 01:05:01.010]  And in fact, we're just getting more people to our core websites like DrudgePredicted, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.610]  But let's explain.
[01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:02.251]  They're dead!
[01:05:03.513 --> 01:05:08.780]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:12.805]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:19.914]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:28.022]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:34.087]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:05:34.707 --> 01:05:46.838]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:05:47.498 --> 01:05:53.025]  Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[01:05:53.806 --> 01:05:57.311]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:17.357]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:52.318 --> 01:07:09.367]  All right, we got Joel Scalzin joining us for the Balance of the Hour here in about two minutes, but I wanted Paul Watson, because we've been talking about 30 minutes, to encapsulate where we are right now, the collapse of mainstream media, the death throes trying to openly shut down all conservative Christian libertarian national speech ahead of the midterms.
[01:07:09.427 --> 01:07:11.048]  Paul, encapsulate that for folks.
[01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:26.509]  Well, the fact is that CNN and all these big media outlets are highly concerned, basically in a blind panic about our increasing influence, despite all the efforts being made against us, which, as I said before the break, are to do with the algorithm.
[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.191]  There have been studies done which show
[01:07:28.872 --> 01:07:41.091]  The order in which search results for political candidates are listed and the negativity or positivity attached to those search results can shift millions, millions of voters in national elections.
[01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:44.476]  They did a big test in India, I think it was, that proved that.
[01:07:45.722 --> 01:07:50.226]  CNN today we find out has lost 30% of its viewers in the past week.
[01:07:50.666 --> 01:08:03.497]  Now on top of that, obviously they got a big boost from their Trump derangement syndrome in the short term, but even with that 90% negative coverage, Trump's doing well, his approval ratings are going up, CNN's viewership's going down, and remember,
[01:08:04.511 --> 01:08:09.474]  Their average viewer, their average primetime viewer is aged 70 years old, I think it was.
[01:08:09.714 --> 01:08:12.296]  No, actually 60, let's be correct, 60 years old.
[01:08:12.336 --> 01:08:13.917]  It used to be 59, it's getting older.
[01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:21.162]  My average viewer on YouTube, and I'm not saying I'm competing directly with CNN, but it's the amalgamation of the alternative independent media.
[01:08:21.622 --> 01:08:24.764]  My average demographic is 18 to 35.
[01:08:25.124 --> 01:08:26.685]  That's the coveted audience.
[01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:29.307]  CNN cannot get near that.
[01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:33.850]  Their average viewer is 60 years old and getting older every single year.
[01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.112]  So this is why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:48.023]  CNN literally lobbied for weeks on end to get YouTube to shut your channel down, my channel down, because we dared question the narrative behind the gun control push after the Parkland shooting.
[01:08:48.343 --> 01:08:54.089]  They seem to have relented on that for the time being, but they're just going to keep coming back stronger and stronger time and time again.
[01:08:54.609 --> 01:09:03.555]  And as you mentioned, Facebook is now the big purge with studies showing that conservative pages on Facebook have lost significant amounts of traffic.
[01:09:03.655 --> 01:09:06.877]  I lost 80% in one week last time I checked.
[01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:09.519]  So we're all slaves to the algorithm.
[01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:11.760]  This is the main focus we need to look at.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.063]  Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, is well aware of this.
[01:09:16.123 --> 01:09:17.924]  That's the environment that he comes from.
[01:09:18.365 --> 01:09:21.006]  We've got people asking questions in Congress about it.
[01:09:21.467 --> 01:09:22.407]  So the fight is on.
[01:09:22.428 --> 01:09:24.369]  This is the new frontier of censorship.
[01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:28.512]  It's going to be more related to the algorithm than actual direct censorship because
[01:09:29.289 --> 01:09:32.770]  You know, it's easier to sell without riling up too many people.
[01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:38.252]  Shadow banning and algorithm manipulation is the new frontier of censorship.
[01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:39.433]  That's what they're going to go for.
[01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:42.134]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson, excellent job.
[01:09:42.174 --> 01:09:47.396]  Glad YouTube's backed off for now, banning your video, breaking down Hollywood trying to push a race war.
[01:09:47.436 --> 01:09:47.976]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:49.371]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:09:49.792 --> 01:10:07.027]  Now, joining us for the balance of the hour is Joel Skousen, editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com, and I wanted to get him on because his uncle, Cleon Skousen, basically researched and developed the goals of communism from some of their own documents and public statements that got read into the record in 1963.
[01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:13.992]  And when you read the goals of communism and you see how much of it has actually been achieved, it is stunning.
[01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:17.816]  So we reposted this to Infowars.com.
[01:10:18.157 --> 01:10:24.123]  Read the secret 45 goals of communism leaked to Congress in 1963.
[01:10:24.623 --> 01:10:26.065]  In the early 1960s, U.S.
[01:10:26.105 --> 01:10:35.715]  intelligence obtained the 45 goals communist internationals intended to carry out to destroy Western civilization and Christianity.
[01:10:36.295 --> 01:10:37.136]  I mean, I had him write that.
[01:10:37.156 --> 01:10:39.059]  It was the Communist Internationale.
[01:10:39.119 --> 01:10:43.485]  But the point is, is that you can find this in the congressional record as well.
[01:10:43.866 --> 01:10:49.473]  And Joe Skousen joins us to get into this because his uncle helped expose it and how the ultra-rich want...
[01:10:50.345 --> 01:10:52.346]  The first point I want to make, Alex, is that my uncle wrote this.
[01:11:13.459 --> 01:11:26.848]  In the early 60s, based upon his research as assistant to J. Edgar Hoover, administrative assistant at the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., but he had not yet discovered the globalist conspiracy yet.
[01:11:27.428 --> 01:11:31.131]  To him, everything looked like a communist conspiracy.
[01:11:31.838 --> 01:11:49.654]  And as I've gone through these 45 goals in preparation for your show today, it's very interesting because from our perspective now, and even if Cleland were alive today, he died in 2006, if he were alive today, he would agree with me that these goals, in fact, were globalist goals.
[01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.233]  Not exclusive communist goals.
[01:11:53.533 --> 01:12:05.587]  And the reason they got pushed through the Communist Party is the globalists were using communists to break down the social order, to break down various countries like Nicaragua and Cuba and Red China.
[01:12:08.147 --> 01:12:25.840]  So, but these were actually engineered by globalists, and that's why, even though most of them have not been implemented by actual communists, they have happened, because the globalists have continued to do that, even after they dismantled the House Committee on American Activities, even though they got rid of McCarthy.
[01:12:26.261 --> 01:12:34.247]  These goals kept going forward, because these are globalist goals which share a great commonality with communism.
[01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:49.075]  Well, I should have said that out of the gates, you know, when I said from intelligence files that Cleon Skousen, your uncle, was a high-level FBI agent, had access to, you know, much, if not all, the secret files and was able to compile this.
[01:12:49.135 --> 01:12:57.218]  But, of course, as soon as he and others like McCarthy started explaining that they were ultra-rich behind communism, I guess they got shut down pretty quick.
[01:12:58.598 --> 01:13:02.904]  Well, the issue is not so much that the ultra-rich control directly the communists.
[01:13:03.324 --> 01:13:06.749]  In other words, the communists are not just puppets of the Western globalists.
[01:13:06.769 --> 01:13:11.775]  They are competing for control of the New World Order, and the globalists use them.
[01:13:12.256 --> 01:13:15.340]  For example, Alger Hiss, who did join the Communist Party,
[01:13:16.185 --> 01:13:26.651]  Henry Kissinger, who joined the Communist Party in East Germany, these were globalists who joined the Communist Party in order to make the communists think that they had one of their own in the State Department.
[01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:40.399]  And so as Alger Hiss led the United States into the United Nations, wrote the Charter, and brought other communists into FDR's White House and the Truman Administration White House, it wasn't really because Alger Hiss was a communist.
[01:13:40.739 --> 01:13:44.061]  It was because he was a globalist who joined the communists so that they wouldn't
[01:13:45.035 --> 01:13:48.040]  Uh, question why he was helping them so much.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:59.637]  So this is a very sophisticated deception we're dealing with here, and it continues today because the globalists are deeply ensconced in every agency of government and continue to push these goals.
[01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:07.731]  Well, we're going to have plenty of time this hour and maybe five minutes the next hour to lay all this out.
[01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:08.972]  But this is real history.
[01:14:09.692 --> 01:14:11.373]  And when you read the goals, you're absolutely right.
[01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:18.518]  This could be called the 45 goals of globalism being carried out by their allies in the whole communist system.
[01:14:18.918 --> 01:14:19.599]  But as you said,
[01:14:20.399 --> 01:14:22.820]  They are competing factions as well.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.981]  So when we come back from this quick break, we'll lay it all out.
[01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:37.664]  But in the minute or so we have before we go to break, can you speak more to the relationship between people like George Soros and others and the Rockefeller Foundation with communism and how that whole dialectic works?
[01:14:40.645 --> 01:14:47.327]  Well, as I say, the globals, the pure globals themselves, like Henry Kissinger and Alger Hiss, who joined the Communist Party.
[01:14:47.347 --> 01:14:49.848]  I mean, George Soros has not joined the Communist Party.
[01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:54.902]  They only share the socialist portions of the goals.
[01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:59.785]  They use communists in their most tyrannical form, of course, to overthrow governments.
[01:15:00.265 --> 01:15:09.351]  And then, of course, the globalists come in and rescue those governments like Nicaragua and like El Salvador and Cuba, which hasn't quite happened yet.
[01:15:09.391 --> 01:15:14.854]  But they come in and rescue them with a quasi free market solution, which is really a form of socialism.
[01:15:15.515 --> 01:15:16.116]  They sell it.
[01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:17.758]  It's a form of corporatism.
[01:15:18.099 --> 01:15:21.643]  For example, in some of these goals, it talks about take over the big corporations.
[01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:25.208]  Well, the commies never did take over the big corporations.
[01:15:25.328 --> 01:15:26.390]  Not a single one of them.
[01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:32.238]  But the globalists have compromised almost every large corporation, especially international corporations.
[01:15:32.258 --> 01:15:32.618]  That's right.
[01:15:32.698 --> 01:15:46.789]  This is the real world system we're talking about, where they'll overthrow the czars, have communism, then work with the communists, make huge profits for themselves out of it, then collapse it, then come in with oligarchs they control, and just do the same thing over and over and over again.
[01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:51.192]  Now they're talking about coming in and saving Venezuela after propping it up for decades.
[01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:56.276]  We'll be back to go over the 45 goals of globalism with Joel Skousen from the Congressional Record.
[01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:16.659]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:25.244]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:26.658 --> 01:16:29.199]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.401]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:34.342 --> 01:16:36.523]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[01:16:38.224 --> 01:16:43.427]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:45.348 --> 01:16:51.951]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:52.931 --> 01:16:53.912]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:55.830 --> 01:17:02.155]  I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:02.655 --> 01:17:03.976]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:05.137 --> 01:17:06.478]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:08.467 --> 01:17:19.392]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:20.113 --> 01:17:21.633]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:22.334 --> 01:17:33.959]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.741]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:37.762 --> 01:17:46.790]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:52.755]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:53.896 --> 01:18:01.763]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:08.757]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[01:18:10.258 --> 01:18:12.280]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.241]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:15.242 --> 01:18:17.904]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:20.526]  We have more than that tuned in over the years.
[01:18:20.566 --> 01:18:25.450]  The point is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:26.551 --> 01:18:37.306]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:37.386 --> 01:18:41.331]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:42.754 --> 01:18:43.414]  Our game changing.
[01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:45.335]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:45.535 --> 01:18:46.676]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:46.736 --> 01:18:50.297]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[01:18:50.617 --> 01:18:51.718]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[01:18:51.798 --> 01:18:56.160]  It's got Preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.761]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:01.062]  It just does incredible things.
[01:19:01.482 --> 01:19:02.942]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:02.962 --> 01:19:05.944]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:05.964 --> 01:19:08.505]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:09.025 --> 01:19:13.850]  That's 4 to 5 of Choletal Silver and Iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:14.471 --> 01:19:28.946]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of Choletal Silver out there, Silver Sol, Nano Silver, Iodine,
[01:19:29.346 --> 01:19:32.949]  The ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[01:19:32.989 --> 01:19:34.270]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:35.672]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:42.357]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:42.658 --> 01:19:44.039]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:44.059 --> 01:19:53.667]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:57.030]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:20.190]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:26.154]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:20:26.634 --> 01:20:29.136]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:29.596 --> 01:20:31.918]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.417 --> 01:20:41.897]  Welcome back.
[01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:42.917]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:43.037 --> 01:20:44.618]  We're 20 minutes into the second hour.
[01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:47.099]  With us a little bit in the next hour is Joel Skousen.
[01:20:47.559 --> 01:20:59.042]  He's a best-selling author, researcher, head of World Affairs Brief, got his own background as an officer in the Marine Corps, Naval Aviator, one of the top experts on building secure homes, strategic relocation.
[01:20:59.302 --> 01:21:02.603]  We sell his documentary film and his book at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:21:02.643 --> 01:21:09.625]  But all of that is important, but not as important as his uncle, Cleon Skousen,
[01:21:10.694 --> 01:21:23.196]  Who was high-level FBI, given access to secret files, to investigate the communist menace, and then wrote the naked communist, then wrote the naked capitalist, that didn't get as much attention, but really told the whole story.
[01:21:23.576 --> 01:21:29.537]  And now if you read what the globalists say today, or what's in the WikiLeaks, it is the current real-world system we live in.
[01:21:29.637 --> 01:21:39.879]  So, a few minutes about Kleonskousen, a few minutes about this whole system, and then we'll go into, though, the goals, the 45 goals of communism,
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:57.734]  Again, leaked to Congress via the FBI via Cleon Skousen back in 1963 and then let's branch this whole thing out just in a few minutes, quantify why this is so important and what the naked capitalist really is, the dirty secret.
[01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:04.000]  Well Alex, Cleon had a real wake-up call when he
[01:22:05.006 --> 01:22:20.326]  Found out during the overthrow of Cuba and Batista that there were actually high level people within the State Department, the second floor of the State Department, which controlled foreign affairs, that were really protecting the communists.
[01:22:20.882 --> 01:22:37.234]  Whenever various pro-Batista and pro-Free Castro people saw who was manipulating this situation at the State Department, they asked for their ouster and they were protected, Cleon found out, by high-level people who were not communists.
[01:22:38.174 --> 01:22:46.681]  Then, you know, when he eventually wrote The Naked Communist, which was a critique of a book by a globalist that was
[01:22:48.314 --> 01:22:50.495]  Really not authorized by the globalists to speak.
[01:22:51.956 --> 01:22:57.598]  In fact, the book was taken out of print thereafter and his widow was threatened not be able to reprint the book.
[01:22:57.999 --> 01:23:11.225]  Because in the book he talks about how they want to control the media, they want to control, this is speaking of globalists, capitalists, wealthy people who wanted to control the world, that they wanted to control both political parties.
[01:23:11.325 --> 01:23:15.267]  They in essence had controlled both political parties for most of
[01:23:16.247 --> 01:23:17.428]  The last two decades.
[01:23:18.049 --> 01:23:24.354]  And so, Cleo noticed that in the goals of the 45 Communist goals, those were their goals, to control both political parties.
[01:23:25.015 --> 01:23:29.979]  And he realized that the Communists couldn't actually directly control them.
[01:23:30.539 --> 01:23:39.527]  At best, they could get into the Socialist Party and, you know, a few media people like The Nation used to be a very Communist publication.
[01:23:40.387 --> 01:23:52.432]  But he realized that it was much broader than just the communist conspiracy, that there were these wealthy capitalists that were controlling the communists, or at least facilitating them coming into the United States.
[01:23:52.532 --> 01:23:56.793]  And those communists themselves thought that the globalists were one of them, but they weren't.
[01:23:57.073 --> 01:23:59.174]  They were secretly facilitating it.
[01:23:59.924 --> 01:24:13.395]  And then planning on discarding communism later on after... And then along comes, you know, years later, in the late 60s, Quigley, from the globalist perspective, just certifying from the inside, 1,100 pages, everything that your uncle has said.
[01:24:14.736 --> 01:24:15.636]  That's exactly right.
[01:24:15.856 --> 01:24:20.360]  And so the book, The Naked Capitalist, really is a critique of Carol Quigley's book.
[01:24:21.259 --> 01:24:22.720]  Who was a professor at Georgetown.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.322]  Georgetown is full of globalists.
[01:24:24.602 --> 01:24:32.008]  Even today, they're the ones that teach at the National War College and indoctrinate all of our military officers so that they turn out to be globalists.
[01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:36.051]  Anybody who gets to be a general or an admiral has to say yes to those systems.
[01:24:36.886 --> 01:24:43.791]  And so it's only natural, when you look at these goals, look at it through the eyes of globalists helping and facilitating communists.
[01:24:43.952 --> 01:24:49.236]  Number one, that they should coexist with communism rather than have atomic war.
[01:24:49.636 --> 01:24:50.717]  That was a globalist thing.
[01:24:50.777 --> 01:24:52.118]  Containment, number two.
[01:24:52.618 --> 01:24:57.382]  That was the doctrine of George Kenan, who was a globalist, not a communist.
[01:24:58.098 --> 01:25:02.281]  And so you see, you see globalists facilitating all of these doctrines.
[01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:06.744]  Developing a number three, the notion of total disarmament by the U.S.
[01:25:06.784 --> 01:25:08.606]  would be the highest moral standard.
[01:25:09.226 --> 01:25:17.212]  And of course your nuclear freeze people were very much associated with the Communist Party and were a lot of communists involved in the anti-nuclear movement.
[01:25:17.252 --> 01:25:21.014]  But they were being used by the globalists to also want to... And that ties into the 7277.
[01:25:21.054 --> 01:25:21.595]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:33.569]  And, you know, they would promote a number four free trade between all nations and we shouldn't exclude communists from free trade.
[01:25:33.789 --> 01:25:35.010]  So it wasn't really free trade.
[01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:44.015]  It was facilitating trade with communists so that you could, you know, share technology with them is what we did all through China and Russia's history.
[01:25:44.688 --> 01:25:48.850]  Number five was extend long-term loans to Russia and the Soviet satellites.
[01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:54.993]  Now you can see obviously the communists would be in favor of this, but the globalists were also in favor of this as well.
[01:25:55.994 --> 01:26:00.797]  Number six was to provide American aid to all nations regardless of communist domination.
[01:26:01.357 --> 01:26:05.899]  Same thing like long-term loans, aid, you don't want to be prejudiced against communists.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.983]  Number seven was grant recognition of Red China and admit Red China to the UN and oust Taiwan.
[01:26:13.644 --> 01:26:25.114]  I mean, it's one thing to admit red China, but why oust free China, Taiwan, and why give red China a seat on the Security Council, a permanent seat with a permanent veto?
[01:26:25.634 --> 01:26:33.601]  That's got to be for conflict creation purposes and to make sure that China and Russia can stop any actual freedom agenda.
[01:26:34.402 --> 01:26:36.464]  And that's exactly what they did.
[01:26:37.688 --> 01:26:46.096]  Number eight was to set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections.
[01:26:46.896 --> 01:26:48.638]  You know, what's not told is the U.S.
[01:26:48.798 --> 01:26:53.683]  also never required Khrushchev to give back the 6,000 U.S.
[01:26:54.303 --> 01:27:00.088]  military prisoners of war that Stalin kept as insurance to make sure that the U.S.
[01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.032]  carried forth Operation Keelhaul.
[01:27:05.329 --> 01:27:12.315]  And even when we did Operation Keelhaul, the Soviets still never gave up the U.S.
[01:27:12.335 --> 01:27:16.139]  prisoners of war or the British prisoners of war, totaling almost 30,000 people.
[01:27:16.199 --> 01:27:22.064]  I mean, isn't the Korean War a great example of standing down for the Chi-Coms to take and have control and making MacArthur stand down?
[01:27:22.084 --> 01:27:25.727]  We could have beat him right then because that was a replay of putting Mao in power in 1949.
[01:27:25.927 --> 01:27:31.552]  The CIA is just a continued, basically sabotaging countries to let the Communists take over.
[01:27:32.469 --> 01:27:32.909]  That's right.
[01:27:33.009 --> 01:27:39.554]  I mean, Americans don't know that the Russian general controlled all U.S., all military operations under U.N.
[01:27:39.634 --> 01:27:41.175]  auspices in the Korean War.
[01:27:41.235 --> 01:27:44.597]  And so all MacArthur's plans had to go through a Russian general.
[01:27:44.978 --> 01:27:47.740]  The only thing that MacArthur did not tell the U.N.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:56.306]  was his Inchon landing, where he did an encirclement and came in almost up at the DMZ and cut the chitcoms off at the border.
[01:27:56.366 --> 01:27:57.727]  He did not tell the U.N.
[01:27:57.767 --> 01:27:57.967]  that.
[01:27:58.007 --> 01:28:00.969]  And they were hopping mad because it was a surprise to them.
[01:28:01.089 --> 01:28:01.610]  And that's right.
[01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:04.814]  Then he figured out, though, that his orders were being handed on.
[01:28:05.115 --> 01:28:07.779]  He said, look, let's just use atomic weapons and end this right now.
[01:28:08.079 --> 01:28:09.902]  We wouldn't have communist China today if he'd have done that.
[01:28:11.344 --> 01:28:11.725]  That's right.
[01:28:13.369 --> 01:28:21.597]  Number nine was to promote the conferences to ban atomic tests, and that got through, but that was a globalist agenda as well.
[01:28:22.138 --> 01:28:26.663]  Number ten was to allow all Soviet satellite countries individual representation in the UN.
[01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:30.286]  That was passed, but by globalists, not necessarily by communists.
[01:28:30.367 --> 01:28:35.312]  And of course, they are free now, most of those states now, and still members of the UN.
[01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:44.778]  But I still contend that most of those have puppet governments that are owing to the Soviets, just like Poland and Czechoslovakia and Vladivostok were communist agents.
[01:28:45.358 --> 01:28:50.081]  Well, I know lending to that, so many of the EU heads now are former top communists.
[01:28:50.701 --> 01:28:52.462]  And that is a fact.
[01:28:53.043 --> 01:28:54.483]  Look at Angela Merkel of Germany.
[01:28:54.504 --> 01:28:55.904]  She was an East German communist.
[01:28:56.545 --> 01:28:59.987]  We'll be right back to go over the 45 secret goals of globalism.
[01:29:02.509 --> 01:29:03.890]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.451]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.651 --> 01:29:06.552]  But where do you get it?
[01:29:06.852 --> 01:29:12.616]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:29:12.856 --> 01:29:18.560]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:35.605]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:38.146]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.686]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:11.214]  How come Hollywood embraces this madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old?
[01:30:11.855 --> 01:30:13.136]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[01:30:13.196 --> 01:30:14.317]  It was statutory rape.
[01:30:14.437 --> 01:30:15.177]  Yeah, alright.
[01:30:15.237 --> 01:30:17.519]  Well, it's not statutory rape.
[01:30:17.799 --> 01:30:19.661]  He had sex with a minor.
[01:30:20.261 --> 01:30:21.462]  That's not rape.
[01:30:21.602 --> 01:30:23.944]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[01:30:24.364 --> 01:30:25.464]  That she didn't want to have.
[01:30:25.584 --> 01:30:27.065]  No, that was not the case at all.
[01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.185]  She wanted to have it.
[01:30:28.265 --> 01:30:31.446]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[01:30:31.786 --> 01:30:32.686]  Dated the guy.
[01:30:33.546 --> 01:30:34.447]  She was 13!
[01:30:34.507 --> 01:30:35.227]  And found out.
[01:30:35.287 --> 01:30:37.847]  Well, by the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:40.168]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything.
[01:30:40.628 --> 01:30:41.248]  Alright?
[01:30:41.348 --> 01:30:41.888]  Wait a second.
[01:30:42.108 --> 01:30:43.489]  Morals in Europe, morals in China.
[01:30:43.609 --> 01:30:51.211]  With a 13 year old girl and you're in a grown man, you know that that's wrong because she has a... Giving her booze and pills.
[01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:52.411]  I'm not... Look.
[01:30:53.175 --> 01:30:55.836]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[01:30:55.896 --> 01:30:58.576]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[01:31:15.265 --> 01:31:19.129]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[01:31:19.509 --> 01:31:29.559]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:36.045]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[01:31:40.008 --> 01:31:48.734]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[01:31:49.134 --> 01:32:05.425]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[01:32:06.065 --> 01:32:15.552]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career ever since, he became well-known.
[01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:18.514]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[01:32:18.554 --> 01:32:23.057]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[01:32:23.097 --> 01:32:24.498]  That's what I do for a living.
[01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:29.982]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[01:32:31.523 --> 01:32:33.485]  It's just what you do for a living.
[01:32:34.654 --> 01:32:36.175]  You have a job.
[01:32:36.675 --> 01:32:39.437]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[01:32:39.738 --> 01:32:47.863]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[01:32:47.883 --> 01:32:52.366]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[01:32:53.507 --> 01:32:54.868]  They have a real problem.
[01:32:54.948 --> 01:32:56.589]  They need to come back down to earth.
[01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:58.070]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:10.425]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.318 --> 01:33:29.043]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.819 --> 01:33:39.923]  It is so critical for people to understand that what we're saying here is not our opinion.
[01:33:42.404 --> 01:33:45.567]  David Rockefeller and many others famously did not want any of this out.
[01:33:46.127 --> 01:33:54.993]  Quigley argued in the late 60s, one of the top professors at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, that we're the elite, this is the best system, let's brag about it.
[01:33:56.654 --> 01:33:57.575]  But he at least wrote
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.040]  I don't know.
[01:34:14.068 --> 01:34:19.773]  And when I went to college for a few years, I could see the programming and I was like, my gosh, everything my dad told me was true.
[01:34:20.513 --> 01:34:25.017]  This is an anti-American, anti-free market, anti-Christian, anti-family agenda.
[01:34:25.817 --> 01:34:31.682]  And didn't mean like I was some super goody two-shoes, you know, guy going around knocking on doors with a Bible.
[01:34:32.082 --> 01:34:33.243]  I'm not knocking folks to do that.
[01:34:33.423 --> 01:34:34.944]  I was just, I don't want to be conquered.
[01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:56.993]  You see them promoting socialism and communism and people with $200 skinny jeans with their $1,000 smartphones, you know, at $3,000 events, like Southwest, and almost every person says, I'm a communist, I'm a socialist, I like Venezuela, and they just giggle and laugh like demons.
[01:34:57.493 --> 01:35:01.555]  And something he said last week, we'll push, because I have stuff to add, we'll push, and he won't mind.
[01:35:03.946 --> 01:35:05.967]  Our guest from Italy who's still on target, Leo Zagami.
[01:35:06.527 --> 01:35:09.228]  Just back like 5-10 minutes, we have time because I was going late today.
[01:35:09.989 --> 01:35:16.991]  But you see the disease, the evil, the corruption, the atheism, the anti-Christian garbage that comes with it.
[01:35:17.432 --> 01:35:26.355]  And then you read the deeper text of this and you read the Council on Foreign Relations and all of them admitting what they're doing like we're dumb animals.
[01:35:26.815 --> 01:35:32.258]  They admit the geoengineering, they admit the breakup of the family, they admit all these horrors.
[01:35:33.158 --> 01:35:35.362]  In their textbooks, even, for PhDs!
[01:35:36.744 --> 01:35:39.948]  And the PhDs laugh and go, Alex, the public's never gonna care.
[01:35:39.988 --> 01:35:40.569]  They're animals.
[01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:41.691]  You ought to join us.
[01:35:42.652 --> 01:35:44.755]  That is so fundamentally sick.
[01:35:45.922 --> 01:35:51.965]  And then under them, because they treat people like animals, because they're the real animals, these globalists, society collapses.
[01:35:52.005 --> 01:35:56.728]  But they love that because then they've got control over free will, because they can starve people to death.
[01:35:56.828 --> 01:36:02.031]  It is the most diabolical, satanic program, not even from a Christian perspective.
[01:36:02.371 --> 01:36:06.173]  But if I just looked at this program, it's what I'd call satanic.
[01:36:07.133 --> 01:36:12.156]  And how they get people roped into wanting to follow it or go along with it makes my head hurt.
[01:36:12.456 --> 01:36:13.937]  But Joel Scouse, as you continue on here,
[01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:25.062]  Just as a contemporary, how they've got a Democrat senator on TV right now during the break saying, oh, they've got proof that Trump, you know, the Russians favored him and all this baloney.
[01:36:27.577 --> 01:36:49.809]  It's just amazing to know what traitors these people are, how they're openly part of an ideology to sell the country out, and to kill free market for the average person, and then they grandstand about how, I'm a Russian agent, or Trump is, or we're agents of this foreign power, how they flipped it around when they're the foreign globalist, and then they somehow turn it around that those of us that are fighting, we're the bad guys.
[01:36:49.849 --> 01:36:50.670]  It's as you keep saying.
[01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:55.451]  They'll attack anybody who covers conspiracy because that's how they operate.
[01:36:55.511 --> 01:36:56.411]  That is what they do.
[01:36:56.451 --> 01:36:59.552]  There is a Democrat conspiracy to overthrow Trump with Russiagate.
[01:36:59.812 --> 01:37:01.832]  There is a conspiracy to get rid of our sovereignty.
[01:37:01.872 --> 01:37:03.913]  There is a conspiracy to get rid of our borders.
[01:37:03.933 --> 01:37:06.534]  There are open conspiracies to break up our families.
[01:37:06.614 --> 01:37:12.035]  I mean, it's there, and if you don't approach it from that, it's all rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[01:37:12.075 --> 01:37:12.635]  That's my rant.
[01:37:15.424 --> 01:37:17.005]  Well, it's true, Alex.
[01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:22.187]  You know, going to point number 11, they want to promote the UN as the only hope for mankind.
[01:37:22.607 --> 01:37:30.091]  And if its charter is rewritten, demand that they set it up as a one world government with its own independent armed forces.
[01:37:30.151 --> 01:37:33.252]  Now, that won't happen and hasn't happened yet.
[01:37:33.892 --> 01:37:36.393]  But that's what World War Three is all about.
[01:37:37.054 --> 01:37:37.154]  And
[01:37:38.175 --> 01:37:40.536]  Absorbing a nuclear first strike on U.S.
[01:37:40.556 --> 01:37:48.280]  military forces so that our globalist leaders can come out of their bunkers and induce everyone to join a militarized global government.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.821]  That's point number 11.
[01:37:49.881 --> 01:37:51.081]  That's a globalist point.
[01:37:51.542 --> 01:37:55.183]  Remember that the communists have never really promoted the U.N.
[01:37:55.463 --> 01:37:57.324]  as its only hope for mankind.
[01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:01.646]  They want to form their own type of new world order under communist control.
[01:38:01.727 --> 01:38:04.128]  China wants to form their own.
[01:38:04.148 --> 01:38:06.629]  So they're competing against the western globals to want
[01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:20.313]  This form, the most sophisticated, deceiving form, because you see, only the globalists are sophisticated enough to tell people, you're still free, you still have democracy, you still have individual rights, like they do in the EU constitution.
[01:38:21.114 --> 01:38:27.236]  But then there are all these exceptions built in, you know, except when social justice needs this, and except when society needs this.
[01:38:27.316 --> 01:38:32.337]  Article 30 and 31 then say, oh, actually, you have all these rights, except the UN says you don't.
[01:38:33.438 --> 01:38:34.538]  Right, precisely.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.884]  Number 12 is resisting any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.
[01:38:39.245 --> 01:38:42.730]  You know, this is all about the censorship thing.
[01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:47.116]  You know, the liberals are very good about saying, you know, we don't want to ban anybody.
[01:38:47.597 --> 01:38:51.482]  But when it comes to Alex Jones and InfoWars, they do want to ban you.
[01:38:52.143 --> 01:39:01.776]  In other words, communists are okay, but the ultra-right, the extremists as they call us, you know, that's never okay, and we will face a ban just as we are in Germany.
[01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:03.918]  And we're not really what they even call ultra-right.
[01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.661]  Aren't we just traditional nationalists?
[01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:08.499]  Yes, they're against that too.
[01:39:08.559 --> 01:39:13.002]  They're against anyone who's in favor of Western, promoting Western civilization or culture.
[01:39:13.302 --> 01:39:24.889]  You know, you can have a black power club at high school, you can have a Latino club, you can have a, you know, you can use black, you can use Latino, you can use every name except white.
[01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:30.013]  You cannot have anything that promotes the Caucasian culture or race.
[01:39:31.329 --> 01:39:32.710]  And not that we need to.
[01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:33.511]  That's not the point.
[01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:36.073]  We can let history speak for itself.
[01:39:36.574 --> 01:39:40.457]  But it really is a one-sided and very hypocritical politically correct response.
[01:39:40.477 --> 01:39:43.260]  Well, they know under the Christian ethos that we want to have everybody come together.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:52.087]  So they use our strength against us and then try to make minorities all under communist systems, liberation theology, race-based.
[01:39:52.688 --> 01:39:56.271]  So that all just explodes so they can decentralize
[01:39:58.653 --> 01:40:01.554]  And then bring everything back into a consolidated system.
[01:40:01.774 --> 01:40:03.874]  But first, they want to create the crisis of the race war.
[01:40:04.254 --> 01:40:04.674]  That's right.
[01:40:04.954 --> 01:40:05.355]  That's right.
[01:40:06.275 --> 01:40:09.115]  Number 13, they want to do away with loyalty oaths.
[01:40:09.155 --> 01:40:12.776]  Now, that loyalty oath came about because of the McCarthy era and taking a loyalty oath.
[01:40:12.836 --> 01:40:15.017]  But, you know, we still have the constitutional oath.
[01:40:15.237 --> 01:40:17.337]  Unfortunately, it is not being enforced.
[01:40:17.417 --> 01:40:20.738]  Nobody has been prosecuted for violating the Constitution.
[01:40:21.278 --> 01:40:24.319]  It's just a hollow form of an oath that we use today.
[01:40:25.043 --> 01:40:27.906]  Number 14 continued giving Russia access to the U.S.
[01:40:27.966 --> 01:40:28.687]  Patent Office.
[01:40:29.187 --> 01:40:35.974]  That was a global school because that's how they gave Russia technology secrets without directly transferring the technology.
[01:40:36.094 --> 01:40:37.075]  And look at China today.
[01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.536]  They take it the day it's posted there.
[01:40:39.357 --> 01:40:40.198]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:41.355 --> 01:40:44.138]  Number 15, capture one or both political parties in the U.S.
[01:40:44.178 --> 01:40:47.201]  Now, the communists never did this, but the globalists, of course, have done both.
[01:40:47.661 --> 01:40:55.909]  They've captured both the Democratic and Republican parties and run them, you know, as party A and party B, but they're both globalist parties.
[01:40:57.143 --> 01:41:02.105]  Number 16, use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions.
[01:41:02.145 --> 01:41:16.810]  This is done through the ACLU, Fabian Socialists and others, which started out as outright communist fronts and now have a more mainstream view.
[01:41:18.476 --> 01:41:25.160]  In point of fact, they have controlled now the actual courts, and not because the judges themselves are communists, but they are globalists.
[01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:28.823]  And those that aren't globalists that are under control are under blackmail.
[01:41:28.843 --> 01:41:39.110]  They have a tremendous amount of blackmail of judges to keep them in control, especially those who are ostensibly conservatives in the Supreme Court, like Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas.
[01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:45.494]  They have ample blackmail on them to turn them, as they did Justice Roberts in the Obamacare decision.
[01:41:46.994 --> 01:41:48.935]  Number 17, get control of the schools.
[01:41:49.235 --> 01:41:53.477]  Well, frankly, the communists have not got control of the schools, but the globalists certainly have.
[01:41:53.758 --> 01:42:02.462]  And that's been going on ever since the founding of the public school movement was meant to take it away from private hands, take it away from... And a great example is Bill Gates.
[01:42:02.502 --> 01:42:08.565]  They use the government running it to ruin it, and then have the new corporate takeover that's even worse, which is the globalization of schools.
[01:42:09.626 --> 01:42:10.546]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:11.006 --> 01:42:13.568]  Gain control, number 18, of all student newspapers.
[01:42:14.008 --> 01:42:14.228]  Well,
[01:42:14.966 --> 01:42:31.195]  There really aren't a lot of communists except in a few major Ivy League universities, but it's hard to tell the difference between a hardcore communist and a hardcore leftist, and almost all students at the leadership level of leftists at major universities.
[01:42:31.235 --> 01:42:36.197]  We gotta go to break, but yeah, they're socialists, communists, but they don't even know they're a communist.
[01:42:36.217 --> 01:42:37.058]  They'll laugh at it.
[01:42:38.211 --> 01:42:40.953]  Even though some of them have, like, male tattoos and stuff.
[01:42:40.973 --> 01:42:41.734]  They think it's cute.
[01:42:42.094 --> 01:42:42.635]  It's funny.
[01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:45.437]  And they go, oh, we only want communism for America.
[01:42:46.278 --> 01:42:48.800]  And we're like, oh, because it doesn't work anywhere else, but it's going to work here.
[01:42:49.261 --> 01:42:50.942]  What they really want is to be in control.
[01:42:50.962 --> 01:42:57.708]  They see that they're creating a new hierarchical system, and they believe because they're college students, they'll be part of the anointed new priesthood.
[01:42:58.489 --> 01:43:00.110]  They're really authoritarians.
[01:43:02.232 --> 01:43:04.875]  Wes, Frank, and North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:43:04.975 --> 01:43:05.255]  Go ahead.
[01:43:05.772 --> 01:43:07.773]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[01:43:07.793 --> 01:43:10.814]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:43:11.635 --> 01:43:12.735]  It just gets old, man.
[01:43:13.055 --> 01:43:14.796]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:43:15.477 --> 01:43:17.578]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:43:17.798 --> 01:43:21.800]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.261]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:43:25.121 --> 01:43:27.442]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:43:27.802 --> 01:43:28.862]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:43:29.162 --> 01:43:30.043]  Us being shut down?
[01:43:30.283 --> 01:43:31.343]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:43:31.743 --> 01:43:32.784]  You know what, Alex?
[01:43:32.824 --> 01:43:33.904]  Put him on pause again.
[01:43:33.924 --> 01:43:34.744]  Hey, Frank!
[01:43:35.044 --> 01:43:40.386]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:43:40.686 --> 01:43:44.968]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:43:45.208 --> 01:43:48.089]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:43:48.349 --> 01:43:48.729]  You understand?
[01:43:48.809 --> 01:43:50.089]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:43:50.449 --> 01:43:51.570]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:57.476]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:44:07.467 --> 01:44:08.487]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:12.169]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:44:12.369 --> 01:44:13.789]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:14.630]  They're suing me.
[01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:16.090]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:44:16.531 --> 01:44:18.331]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:44:18.371 --> 01:44:19.732]  We were bringing $5 million in a year.
[01:44:19.752 --> 01:44:20.992]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:44:21.152 --> 01:44:23.033]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:44:23.273 --> 01:44:24.874]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[01:44:25.214 --> 01:44:28.015]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:29.836]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:44:29.876 --> 01:44:30.436]  Tell him right there.
[01:44:30.476 --> 01:44:30.716]  Frank!
[01:44:31.016 --> 01:44:31.577]  Hey, Frank!
[01:44:31.837 --> 01:44:33.078]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:44:33.498 --> 01:44:37.162]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[01:44:37.202 --> 01:44:38.683]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[01:44:38.723 --> 01:44:39.084]  It's nice.
[01:44:39.264 --> 01:44:49.593]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[01:44:49.713 --> 01:44:50.334]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:50.374 --> 01:44:52.456]  Using every resource at their disposal.
[01:44:52.516 --> 01:44:53.717]  So it's not bragging.
[01:44:53.837 --> 01:44:56.359]  It's a daily reality, and that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.183]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:44:59.203 --> 01:44:59.703]  We're doing it now.

[01:45:19.005 --> 01:45:19.625]  We're fighting!
[01:45:19.885 --> 01:45:21.206]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:45:21.286 --> 01:45:25.549]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.

[01:45:29.371 --> 01:45:30.131]  Do you understand?

[01:45:39.385 --> 01:45:42.466]  We have Alpha Power back in stock!
[01:45:42.546 --> 01:45:46.486]  The fan favorite is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:46.566 --> 01:45:54.008]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[01:45:54.068 --> 01:45:58.849]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[01:45:58.949 --> 01:45:59.569]  As you age,
[01:45:59.909 --> 01:46:00.349]  We all do.
[01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:04.713]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[01:46:04.733 --> 01:46:06.154]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[01:46:06.354 --> 01:46:10.277]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:17.983]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[01:46:18.786 --> 01:46:27.791]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[01:46:27.952 --> 01:46:36.096]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[01:46:36.196 --> 01:46:37.417]  It is Alpha Power.
[01:46:37.457 --> 01:46:38.398]  It is back in stock.
[01:46:38.438 --> 01:46:45.342]  It is one of the biggest, best, most favorite products on infowarsstore.com, and it's back in stock right now at 25% off.
[01:46:45.402 --> 01:46:47.363]  Go and read the five-star review.
[01:46:47.363 --> 01:46:49.004]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:30.607 --> 01:47:34.512]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:36.115 --> 01:47:40.861]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:43.444 --> 01:47:47.490]  Alright, Leo Zagami has been in the P2 Lodge Illuminati in
[01:47:49.677 --> 01:47:50.137]  I've been over there.
[01:47:50.177 --> 01:47:50.677]  I've met with him.
[01:47:50.737 --> 01:47:53.818]  He knocks on doors and gets in the castles, the whole nine yards.
[01:47:55.578 --> 01:47:57.099]  He's a very interesting fella.
[01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:59.479]  He said this pope would come in years before he did.
[01:47:59.499 --> 01:48:06.761]  He predicted that the pope would then start saying there would be a precedent for two popes at once or for popes to retire after a term.
[01:48:07.121 --> 01:48:08.441]  The pope just announced that yesterday.
[01:48:08.921 --> 01:48:13.462]  He said about a year ago that the folks in the Vatican would
[01:48:15.598 --> 01:48:20.960]  The whole Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, would be taking over the Order of Knights of Malta.
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:22.781]  That just happened last week, so he's going to be joining us.
[01:48:23.121 --> 01:48:27.563]  We're pushing him back 15 minutes because I got late with Paul and the whole censorship emergency going on.
[01:48:27.583 --> 01:48:29.063]  But I want to say something right up front here.
[01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:33.985]  I don't take on George Soros and the Globalists because I have a death wish.
[01:48:34.425 --> 01:48:40.828]  I do it because at an instinctive and spiritual level, I cannot give in to them because I know they're pure evil.
[01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:43.809]  So it's like a burning in the bones.
[01:48:45.199 --> 01:48:49.481]  And they've told me, in a bunch of the lawsuits, they'll just add a thing about calling George Soros a Nazi.
[01:48:49.862 --> 01:48:50.522]  And I've been known.
[01:48:50.842 --> 01:48:56.365]  Stop calling him a Nazi, leave him alone, kiss his ring, and you'll be left alone.
[01:48:56.425 --> 01:49:01.448]  And years ago, there was overtures from the whole Soros combine, and then Facebook said, oh, try your Facebook now!
[01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:03.790]  And I'd have like two million views on every video.
[01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:04.510]  They unblocked me.
[01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:07.472]  Then about a month later, they're, you're not being nice to Zuckerberg.
[01:49:07.512 --> 01:49:08.332]  Boom, you're blocked.
[01:49:08.873 --> 01:49:09.853]  Now I'm gonna be totally banned.
[01:49:09.893 --> 01:49:10.514]  That's fine!
[01:49:11.154 --> 01:49:12.575]  I'm not trying to make it in your system.
[01:49:13.345 --> 01:49:23.153]  But that said, I don't want to get up here in front of everybody and just act all jolly about this, and I don't like to even let the enemy know they're having an effect, but they know what they're doing.
[01:49:23.573 --> 01:49:24.134]  I want to grow.
[01:49:24.154 --> 01:49:26.856]  I want to go 24 hours a day, at least 20 hours a day by the end of the year.
[01:49:27.016 --> 01:49:27.897]  I want to expand.
[01:49:28.317 --> 01:49:35.523]  We're having a big effect on TV now, on cable and stuff, but we're about $2 million behind what we were last year.
[01:49:35.543 --> 01:49:36.384]  That sounds like a lot of money.
[01:49:36.424 --> 01:49:36.724]  It's not.
[01:49:36.764 --> 01:49:38.746]  Just the uplinks and stuff is like a million bucks a year.
[01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:49.651]  Okay, and so, blocking us from advertising online, bunch of places, going after sponsors, all the crap they pulled, not to mention all the lawsuits, two million behind.
[01:49:51.072 --> 01:49:51.872]  So, it's simple.
[01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:55.494]  If they can start making us contract, they're winning.
[01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:57.531]  We need to expand.
[01:49:58.171 --> 01:50:00.213]  These critical midterms are absolutely vital.
[01:50:00.793 --> 01:50:01.754]  I need you to go to the store.
[01:50:01.954 --> 01:50:03.595]  I need you to get great supplements.
[01:50:03.875 --> 01:50:06.477]  Our turmeric formula is the strongest one you can find out there.
[01:50:06.497 --> 01:50:07.758]  50% off right now.
[01:50:08.018 --> 01:50:09.459]  Our fluoride-free toothpaste is excellent.
[01:50:09.799 --> 01:50:10.760]  That's all 50% off.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.302]  We've got so many other great products.
[01:50:14.442 --> 01:50:17.745]  X2 is 25% off, even though it's close to selling out.
[01:50:17.805 --> 01:50:21.127]  We've got it with the BioTruth Selenium 50% off.
[01:50:21.167 --> 01:50:22.128]  Those two things combo.
[01:50:22.168 --> 01:50:23.949]  These are the biggest sales we've ever done.
[01:50:25.182 --> 01:50:25.942]  For this time of year.
[01:50:27.143 --> 01:50:29.364]  And we've got all super blue products 50% off.
[01:50:29.424 --> 01:50:37.827]  So we've also got Strategic Relocation, a big, thick, color coffee table book with global information, national information, super accurate.
[01:50:38.967 --> 01:50:40.048]  I'm not perfect either.
[01:50:55.996 --> 01:50:58.038]  But I'm way more moral compared to most people.
[01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:00.780]  Just in the work ethic area, people are very lazy.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:01.980]  They don't even want to work.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:02.621]  I like to work.
[01:51:02.961 --> 01:51:04.983]  And I'm just saying, civilization, we're losing it, folks.
[01:51:05.403 --> 01:51:06.524]  Everybody's getting depressed.
[01:51:06.684 --> 01:51:07.845]  Mental illness is exploding.
[01:51:08.325 --> 01:51:10.306]  This is all admittedly scientifically done.
[01:51:10.647 --> 01:51:12.108]  We're under very high-tech attack.
[01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:14.869]  Only being fully conscious of it gives you any shot.
[01:51:15.150 --> 01:51:17.911]  And asking Jesus Christ for protection.
[01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:21.774]  And I'm serious, that's all that really does, at the end of the day, work against this evil.
[01:51:22.294 --> 01:51:23.134]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:51:23.955 --> 01:51:27.737]  Some of the stuff they pulled on me, all I can say is, God, Jesus, it's yours, please help me.
[01:51:28.277 --> 01:51:30.379]  This is a very critical time, folks better know it.
[01:51:30.899 --> 01:51:35.424]  And I need you to go to infowarestore.com if you want to see us rampage forward.
[01:51:35.464 --> 01:51:39.808]  Now, they may just put a bullet in me, but I don't think they want to turn me into a martyr.
[01:51:39.868 --> 01:51:43.651]  So they want to assassinate my character, and they want to try to slow us down and destroy us.
[01:51:43.892 --> 01:51:45.553]  I don't see that happening, but...
[01:51:46.545 --> 01:51:56.873]  If it continues and people don't buy the products and the t-shirts and the stuff you need anyways, when it's already so great, then they will cause us to contract.
[01:51:57.554 --> 01:52:02.938]  If you understand this is a war, a fight we're all in, and we've been chosen as an example here.
[01:52:03.418 --> 01:52:04.239]  We're your gladiator.
[01:52:04.599 --> 01:52:04.919]  We're good to go.
[01:52:19.924 --> 01:52:22.646]  So Facebook is announcing that we're basically banned the 24th.
[01:52:22.666 --> 01:52:24.567]  We're going back to Joel Skousen.
[01:52:24.587 --> 01:52:29.610]  I appreciate him going through the goals of globalism, which are really the goals of communism, and intertwined.
[01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:31.952]  It's at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:52:31.992 --> 01:52:35.234]  I have a copy of it from the congressional record on infowars.com.
[01:52:35.614 --> 01:52:38.636]  But we're understanding the real system according to them.
[01:52:39.196 --> 01:52:41.218]  This isn't all the smoke screens and the rest of it.
[01:52:41.618 --> 01:52:43.219]  You're getting the real enchilada.
[01:52:43.539 --> 01:52:47.202]  Okay, please continue with the goals or you can comment on what I just talked about here.
[01:52:47.222 --> 01:52:48.923]  We'll have two more segments to finish up on the goals.
[01:52:49.384 --> 01:52:50.064]  It's your choice.
[01:52:50.124 --> 01:52:58.471]  I just have to put out those SOS, you know, emergency transmissions to the listeners so they understand just how serious this fight's gotten.
[01:52:59.952 --> 01:53:03.815]  Oh, it is very serious, Alex, and you really are the tip of the spear and
[01:53:04.764 --> 01:53:06.805]  The main target for them.
[01:53:06.925 --> 01:53:10.687]  So you need to help and support your efforts.
[01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:16.169]  Number 19 is to you is something communists are very deeply involved and still are to this day.
[01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:18.010]  And that is using a student protest.
[01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:29.256]  Anytime George Charles wants to gin up a protest against Trump or immigration or gun control, he calls the the communist organizers who bring up the student protest.
[01:53:29.336 --> 01:53:33.598]  And of course, there's a lot of follow follow on people in
[01:53:34.787 --> 01:53:40.650]  In the public schools, because they're all trained in liberalism and in colleges, so it's very easy to go beyond the communist cadres.
[01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:44.852]  Those are the core people that they still use to gin up protests.
[01:53:45.452 --> 01:53:47.193]  Number 20 is infiltrate the press.
[01:53:47.373 --> 01:53:50.195]  That's something that globalists have done much more than the communists.
[01:53:50.595 --> 01:53:55.618]  Same thing with 21, which is gaining control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
[01:53:56.118 --> 01:53:58.099]  There were communist-oriented people.
[01:53:58.559 --> 01:54:02.041]  A lot of those were soft communists, not outright communist organizers.
[01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:07.373]  And the left, of course, is predominant in all media here.
[01:54:07.953 --> 01:54:09.574]  And it's not just a left-wing media.
[01:54:09.614 --> 01:54:17.419]  It really is a pro-government media, which means it's controlled by the globalist control system, the deep state, if you will.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.002]  CIA pays for a lot of journalists up to $50,000 a year.
[01:54:23.102 --> 01:54:24.143]  They pay off judges.
[01:54:24.663 --> 01:54:31.908]  They collect these payoffs at casinos, oftentimes, in chips, so that they can launder these bribes to judges.
[01:54:33.437 --> 01:54:38.520]  Number 22 through 24 talk about discrediting and destroying American Western culture.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.782]  While that's a communist goal, that's also a globalist goal.
[01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:47.065]  That's what creating conflict and driving Muslim refugees into Europe is all about.
[01:54:47.105 --> 01:54:50.627]  That's what's driving Latin Americans to the United States.
[01:54:50.907 --> 01:54:56.950]  Not so much because they're that much different in culture, but because it waters down the conservative voting values.
[01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:12.078]  But you know, you control art critics, you control and get rid of laws controlling obscenity, and you loosen up censorship when it comes to communism, but then you tighten down censorship when it comes to the right wing, which we're seeing and talking about today.
[01:55:14.927 --> 01:55:17.789]  Promoting pornography, 25, that's been done.
[01:55:17.969 --> 01:55:24.112]  You know, a lot of these things like obscenity and pornography, there's a tremendous amount of satanic influence on the lives of people that promotes this.
[01:55:25.373 --> 01:55:33.477]  You don't have to be a communist to get on this bandwagon for promoting the libertine lifestyle and the pornography.
[01:55:33.557 --> 01:55:37.399]  I mean, there's a natural man incentive to go that direction.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.381]  By the way, that was a term I misused about five years ago.
[01:55:40.421 --> 01:55:41.161]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:41.861]  I'm a libertine.
[01:55:41.881 --> 01:55:44.962]  My dad's like, libertine means you're like a satanic sex person.
[01:55:44.982 --> 01:55:45.843]  Alex, don't use that.
[01:55:45.883 --> 01:55:48.144]  So sometimes I use the wrong terms, but absolutely.
[01:55:48.164 --> 01:55:51.285]  I mean, behind all this really is a satanic influence.
[01:55:52.965 --> 01:55:53.685]  Yes, that's right.
[01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.006]  We can't underestimate that.
[01:55:55.066 --> 01:55:59.768]  And especially when it comes to the degeneracy of sexual and
[01:56:01.391 --> 01:56:11.316]  And one's natural sexuality, homosexuality, transgender, all of the stuff that's being promoted is very much a satanic agenda.
[01:56:11.576 --> 01:56:14.157]  That isn't to say that all homosexuals are satanic.
[01:56:14.617 --> 01:56:23.341]  Some of those are just consuming their own particular lusts and going after sex in a way that the Lord doesn't approve of.
[01:56:23.965 --> 01:56:38.914]  But in any case, this combined with the next goals, 27, 28 and 29, about eliminating religion and eliminating prayer in schools and religious expressions by government, this is very much the dumbing down of religion.
[01:56:38.954 --> 01:56:40.295]  And a lot of it's voluntary.
[01:56:40.575 --> 01:56:46.579]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin has been very vocal about the fact that the mainstream churches just won't take a stand.
[01:56:47.559 --> 01:56:54.263]  And let's remember, when this was said in Congress in 63 with your uncle from the FBI exposing it, this sounded like space alien talk.
[01:56:54.283 --> 01:56:55.684]  People couldn't believe this would ever happen.
[01:56:55.884 --> 01:56:57.385]  And we look at it, it's almost all happened.
[01:56:58.513 --> 01:56:58.893]  That's right.
[01:56:59.494 --> 01:57:02.235]  This has all happened, and especially the dumbing down of religion.
[01:57:02.295 --> 01:57:12.721]  I mean, it's very difficult to find any religion, even a lot of traditional evangelical religions, which used to be hardcore conservatives, are very, very soft conservatives now.
[01:57:12.761 --> 01:57:14.202]  They won't stand up to government.
[01:57:14.222 --> 01:57:20.986]  A lot of that happened during the George W. Bush regime, when Terry Falwell and others got invited to the White House for Friday prayer breakfast.
[01:57:21.246 --> 01:57:23.907]  And then we saw Obama go after him with the IRS.
[01:57:23.927 --> 01:57:31.268]  We'll be right back in two minutes with Joel Scouse and two more segments to finish up the 45 goals of the communists, which you then learned were the globalists.
[01:57:32.029 --> 01:57:33.589]  And again, this is critical information.
[01:57:33.609 --> 01:57:34.629]  Two different groups with the same agenda.
[01:57:34.649 --> 01:57:37.830]  Kind of like the big tech giants, all want to have the AI god.
[01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:38.970]  All want to replace humans.
[01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:41.691]  All believe they're going to merge with machines unless you're Elon Musk.
[01:57:41.711 --> 01:57:42.351]  He's worrying about it.
[01:57:42.831 --> 01:57:45.412]  But they're all fighting with each other to get that control.
[01:57:45.932 --> 01:57:47.972]  And that is the great Luciferian deception.
[01:57:48.012 --> 01:57:48.512]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.572 --> 01:57:50.453]  Hour number three, two minutes away.
[01:57:52.213 --> 01:58:01.057]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.277 --> 01:58:04.078]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:04.118 --> 01:58:11.241]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:11.661 --> 01:58:17.464]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:18.144 --> 01:58:19.466]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:58:20.066 --> 01:58:39.125]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.206 --> 01:58:44.332]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:44.652 --> 01:58:49.919]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[01:58:50.339 --> 01:58:51.381]  As above, so below.
[01:58:51.941 --> 01:58:54.765]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:55.646 --> 01:58:56.727]  Most tiniest scales.
[01:58:57.247 --> 01:58:58.328]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:58.748 --> 01:59:00.249]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:00.650 --> 01:59:01.130]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.790]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:02.831]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:03.532 --> 01:59:05.653]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.153 --> 01:59:12.117]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:12.498 --> 01:59:18.382]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:19.122 --> 01:59:25.404]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.164 --> 01:59:28.705]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:28.765 --> 01:59:35.167]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:41.829 --> 01:59:44.211]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:44.871 --> 01:59:48.113]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at m4slife.com.
[01:59:48.434 --> 01:59:52.176]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:56.199 --> 01:59:59.862]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:09.747 --> 02:00:14.291]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:15.292 --> 02:00:17.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:18.555 --> 02:00:21.117]  All right, Joe Skousen for two more segments.
[02:00:21.517 --> 02:00:23.339]  Editor-in-chief of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:00:23.419 --> 02:00:24.480]  Excellent news and information.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.762]  I haven't even gotten into all this other news.
[02:00:27.062 --> 02:00:30.405]  No whites allowed day at Evergreen University continues in the second year.
[02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:35.471]  If you criticize it, you are expelled, or professors are fired.
[02:00:35.491 --> 02:00:40.052]  A Swedish bishop welcomes Muslim call to prayer as good for society.
[02:00:40.092 --> 02:00:41.953]  Churches are not allowed all over Europe.
[02:00:41.973 --> 02:00:45.995]  I have the articles at their church bells at one-third the decibels of the call to prayer.
[02:00:46.675 --> 02:00:48.876]  I mean, this is just a deliberate rubbing the nose.
[02:00:48.896 --> 02:00:54.118]  This is the ecumenical World Council of Churches' devil-pope takeover of Christianity.
[02:00:54.838 --> 02:01:02.409]  And again, I've never been a critic of Catholics in general, but man, I gotta tell you, the big modern devil pup that we've got, we're gonna be discussing that.
[02:01:02.429 --> 02:01:03.491]  This guy's going for broke.
[02:01:04.152 --> 02:01:05.353]  Finishing up with Joel Skousen.
[02:01:05.393 --> 02:01:06.775]  Again, you can find his great
[02:01:07.914 --> 02:01:10.776]  Amazing book that everybody should order at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:01:11.216 --> 02:01:13.297]  You can also find the film there where he breaks it all down.
[02:01:13.757 --> 02:01:15.318]  It's vital information.
[02:01:15.338 --> 02:01:17.479]  You can also find it at WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:01:17.799 --> 02:01:22.061]  You can also send, we'll tell you later, an email you can send and get a free copy of his latest issue.
[02:01:22.081 --> 02:01:25.403]  We've got like three, four minutes of this segment, ten minutes of the next, and we'll get you out of here.
[02:01:25.783 --> 02:01:26.584]  Sorry I got you on late.
[02:01:26.604 --> 02:01:30.826]  We had some big emergency breaking news earlier with censorship that's just going into total high gear.
[02:01:31.206 --> 02:01:37.129]  But finishing up with what you were getting into with the takeover of the churches you were just mentioning and the next communist goal.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:42.581]  You know, this has not been so much as a direct takeover by communists.
[02:01:42.601 --> 02:01:49.604]  This has been a use of political correctness to sensitize pastors so that they don't want to do anything to offend homosexuals.
[02:01:49.624 --> 02:01:51.304]  We don't want to do anything to offend liberals.
[02:01:51.965 --> 02:01:58.267]  And so it just skews the conversation and the narrative in churches to the soft social document.
[02:01:58.527 --> 02:02:01.809]  You only talk about the soft Jesus Christ, the all-loving Jesus.
[02:02:01.849 --> 02:02:10.333]  You never talk about the fury of the Lord, the millstone upon the neck of those that abuse children, or any of the hard doctrines of Jesus Christ.
[02:02:10.414 --> 02:02:12.935]  It's only now the soft version of Christianity.
[02:02:12.955 --> 02:02:23.501]  Christ beating people with cataract pills, overturning tables, kicking bankers in the face, Samson tumbling down buildings on top people, Moses throwing down tablets, burning people to death.
[02:02:23.521 --> 02:02:24.021]  There's none of that.
[02:02:25.512 --> 02:02:30.834]  That's right, and there's no remembrance of the fact that Jesus called the Pharisees, ye vipers and hypocrites.
[02:02:30.894 --> 02:02:35.036]  I mean, those were the strongest words you could use in the Jewish culture.
[02:02:35.696 --> 02:02:39.877]  And so this was hardly loving your neighbor in the embracing sort of way.
[02:02:40.398 --> 02:02:43.719]  And that's what Christianity has become, only the soft version.
[02:02:44.218 --> 02:02:47.119]  But you know the goals 29 and 30 discredit the U.S.
[02:02:47.179 --> 02:02:50.541]  Constitution as old-fashioned and discredit the Founding Fathers.
[02:02:50.581 --> 02:02:53.962]  That's really been taken over by the liberals in the universities.
[02:02:54.522 --> 02:02:58.224]  They really, the globalists, aren't trying anymore to get rid of the Constitution.
[02:02:58.244 --> 02:03:02.346]  They are content to control the Constitution through legal interpretation.
[02:03:03.046 --> 02:03:07.968]  In fact, you talk about... Well, they're killing it by fiat though, but I mean, for all intents and purposes, they're overriding it.
[02:03:09.246 --> 02:03:10.968]  That's right, but they're not eliminating it.
[02:03:11.028 --> 02:03:11.969]  They can work within it.
[02:03:12.269 --> 02:03:13.650]  I mean, that's their response.
[02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:15.212]  They're just twisting it up in pretzels.
[02:03:16.393 --> 02:03:23.980]  Yes, and any constitutionalist who says we want to restore the Constitution says, we don't mind, because we interpret the Constitution according to case law.
[02:03:24.201 --> 02:03:25.482]  And that's exactly what they do.
[02:03:27.195 --> 02:03:39.246]  Of course you have control of teachers of American history so that you distort American history and culture and refuse to talk about the things that really enhance the Second Amendment or the Christian base of American culture.
[02:03:40.067 --> 02:03:43.090]  All that is a communist goal and it's also a globalist goal.
[02:03:43.695 --> 02:03:58.680]  Number 32 is support any socialist movement to give government more centralized control in social agencies, welfare programs especially, drawing upon the heartstrings of Americans to give, give, give, and internationally as well, even though we're essentially bankrupt as a nation.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:05.842]  Number 34, eliminated the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
[02:04:05.902 --> 02:04:06.702]  They did do that.
[02:04:06.962 --> 02:04:09.803]  That was through American liberals, not through the communists themselves.
[02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:15.194]  Number 35 has not happened, discredited and eventually dismantled the FBI.
[02:04:15.674 --> 02:04:24.263]  Basically, the Deep State took over the FBI, as we've seen with Comey and Mueller and even now with Christopher Wray, an insider in the FBI.
[02:04:24.604 --> 02:04:32.092]  They did not dismantle it and don't intend to dismantle it because they've now co-opted the FBI, made it a tool of the Deep State.
[02:04:33.121 --> 02:04:34.822]  Infiltrate and control more unions?
[02:04:35.002 --> 02:04:36.704]  Yes, that occurred in spades.
[02:04:36.884 --> 02:04:41.407]  Unions used to be especially totally controlled by communist front organizations.
[02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:47.331]  Now they're simply, you know, deep into corruption, not necessarily communism.
[02:04:48.511 --> 02:04:52.374]  Number 37, they did not gain control of big business, but the globalists did.
[02:04:52.714 --> 02:05:02.641]  Let's come back and go over the final few, and then I'm gonna give you the floor in this segment to really lay out then this amalgamation that your uncle talked about 50 years ago that's been confirmed of how they synergistically move them together.
[02:05:07.882 --> 02:05:13.386]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:05:13.626 --> 02:05:21.191]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:05:21.491 --> 02:05:24.633]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:05:24.833 --> 02:05:29.935]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:05:30.095 --> 02:05:32.636]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:05:32.876 --> 02:05:41.860]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:53.645]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pal Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:05:53.885 --> 02:05:58.587]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:58.707 --> 02:06:00.368]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:30.836 --> 02:06:39.283]  Joe Skousen is here for one more segment, and Leo Zegami is going to be joining us with the huge developments in the Vatican that affect everything, because the Vatican is now 100% globalist.
[02:06:39.984 --> 02:06:49.933]  You could argue about the past or whatever, but it is now a world government, Christianity is bad, open to Islam, one world government, communism is good, it is just insane.
[02:06:51.075 --> 02:06:52.136]  So that's all coming up.
[02:06:52.597 --> 02:06:53.618]  And then I've got some other news.
[02:06:53.638 --> 02:06:55.781]  We're going to weave into this and tie into this.
[02:06:55.801 --> 02:06:57.603]  The article's up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:57.984 --> 02:06:59.165]  It's on Newswars.com.
[02:06:59.205 --> 02:07:08.096]  Read the secret 45 goals of communism leaked via FBI investigation to Congress in 1963 when Leon Skousen, the uncle of
[02:07:09.196 --> 02:07:13.680]  Cleon Skousen, the uncle of Joel Skousen, is with us now, exposed it.
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:16.242]  And again, this is critical as he follows the last few.
[02:07:16.722 --> 02:07:19.564]  Communism was never meant by the globalists to take full control.
[02:07:19.624 --> 02:07:28.712]  They just financed it and controlled it to break up countries, to kill the Christians, then come in, the globalists as saviors, and then bring in a quasi-system we saw three years ago.
[02:07:28.732 --> 02:07:35.357]  Obama went to Argentina, Chile, and also he went to Africa, but he gave the same speech.
[02:07:36.448 --> 02:07:39.311]  Now, you need communism, but you also need big corporations.
[02:07:39.391 --> 02:07:41.593]  You'll be communist, and then the corporations will work with you.
[02:07:42.013 --> 02:07:47.138]  So he put it all together, and the people are like, hmm, these are all PhD students.
[02:07:47.198 --> 02:07:49.641]  So this is the system.
[02:07:49.681 --> 02:07:59.931]  So Joel, finish up the other points, and I'm going to give you the floor here, and then just get into then how we tie all this together, because we are breaking down right now the true global system that we're operating under.
[02:08:01.328 --> 02:08:05.973]  Goal number 38 was to transfer some of the arrest powers of police to social agencies.
[02:08:06.013 --> 02:08:18.505]  Now, while that hasn't happened, what has happened is a subsidiary of that goal to treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric orders, to give psychiatrists more power to incarcerate people for psychiatric.
[02:08:18.546 --> 02:08:21.749]  That's a thing that the communists were very, very good at, the Soviet agency.
[02:08:21.789 --> 02:08:22.890]  We're heading towards that.
[02:08:24.469 --> 02:08:28.871]  And they do, the left does dominate the psychiatric profession.
[02:08:29.391 --> 02:08:34.913]  Psychiatrists refuse to talk about the key things that really understand human behavioral problems.
[02:08:35.514 --> 02:08:52.441]  One, the innateness of the spirit of the man, which comes from certain predispositions, some good and some evil, the workings of conscience and how Satan and the Lord interact with people and how they reject the Lord sometimes and get taken over by satanic influence, especially suicide or
[02:08:53.553 --> 02:08:55.614]  Use a gun to commit crimes, etc.
[02:08:55.674 --> 02:09:09.320]  Those are something that psychiatrists cannot cure society's ills or even analyze them correctly without understanding the role of conscience and the role of Satan to speak to people's minds, which they do not accept, unfortunately.
[02:09:10.699 --> 02:09:14.981]  Discredit the family as an institution, number 40, and make a divorce easy.
[02:09:15.101 --> 02:09:16.001]  That has happened.
[02:09:16.541 --> 02:09:19.202]  Happened through liberals, not necessarily through communists.
[02:09:20.162 --> 02:09:25.064]  Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents, goal number 41.
[02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:31.026]  Now that is a communist goal, but that has not and will not be implemented directly in the United States.
[02:09:31.566 --> 02:09:39.029]  But the role of the public schools in basically taking over the raising of children and indoctrinating them and schooling them and
[02:09:40.256 --> 02:09:43.817]  You know, making them susceptible to homosexuality, that's happening.
[02:09:44.497 --> 02:09:47.578]  And that is a globalist goal that has been accomplished.
[02:09:48.498 --> 02:09:51.219]  Unlike communist countries, they take children away from parents.
[02:09:51.239 --> 02:09:57.881]  Number 42, create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of American tradition.
[02:09:58.281 --> 02:10:01.922]  That goes back to the protests and the left background in protests.
[02:10:02.869 --> 02:10:05.051]  Number 43, has been fully accomplished.
[02:10:05.171 --> 02:10:10.976]  Overthrew all colonial governments and turned them over to pro-communist regimes as they did in Africa.
[02:10:11.597 --> 02:10:14.299]  Number 44, internationalize the Panama Canal.
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.341]  The communists frankly didn't do that.
[02:10:16.621 --> 02:10:22.507]  Jimmy Carter and the globalists did it and it has helped the communists, but it was more for globalist purposes.
[02:10:22.907 --> 02:10:24.308]  And number 45 is very important.
[02:10:24.949 --> 02:10:25.829]  It has not happened.
[02:10:25.890 --> 02:10:27.551]  Repeal the Connolly Reservation.
[02:10:29.301 --> 02:10:33.364]  Where this was a, in accepting the World Court, the U.S.
[02:10:33.384 --> 02:10:44.031]  Senate passed the Connolly Reservation, basically that we can reject World Court jurisdiction for anything that interferes with national sovereignty or U.S.
[02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:45.072]  internal policy.
[02:10:45.733 --> 02:10:52.798]  And other countries have adapted forms of that too, and that's what has kept the World Court at bay all of these years.
[02:10:53.138 --> 02:10:56.200]  And so that number 45 has not been accomplished.
[02:11:01.269 --> 02:11:19.081]  And so, in general, what I want to say is that these goals are moving forward under the aegis of globalism, which uses communism, and is very much pointing Americans towards what life is going to be like in a globalist world government.
[02:11:19.582 --> 02:11:26.106]  I can tell you very, very strongly that when globalist government comes, it will not be like communist tyranny.
[02:11:26.126 --> 02:11:26.707]  There will not be
[02:11:27.777 --> 02:11:29.498]  Ownership of all the means of production.
[02:11:29.538 --> 02:11:32.999]  You'll still have private companies, but it'll be more like fascism.
[02:11:33.039 --> 02:11:35.240]  They control the companies.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:36.980]  They control you through taxation.
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:40.702]  They control you through politically correct mandates.
[02:11:40.742 --> 02:11:43.823]  For example, you've got a 50% women on your boards of directors.
[02:11:43.863 --> 02:11:46.484]  You've got to have certain Latinos and certain amount of blacks.
[02:11:46.824 --> 02:11:47.504]  There'll be quotas.
[02:11:47.564 --> 02:11:48.524]  Oh, you're still free.
[02:11:49.085 --> 02:11:52.866]  You have all these rules and controls which will restrict your ability to be free.
[02:11:55.385 --> 02:12:00.089]  And that's why there's the beating everyone over the head that you're racist if you're white, you're racist if you're white.
[02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:04.612]  When it was England worldwide that fought a bunch of wars to end slavery, even attacked us over it.
[02:12:05.152 --> 02:12:06.774]  All these Muslim countries are still running it.
[02:12:07.114 --> 02:12:08.055]  But no one cares.
[02:12:08.095 --> 02:12:13.679]  You know, I was out with friends on a boat this weekend with my children.
[02:12:15.191 --> 02:12:21.354]  And I pulled in to get some gas and these were, they said they were Ethiopian, but then they kind of act like they were Muslim.
[02:12:21.974 --> 02:12:27.977]  And they said, you know, we're really disappointed in your video saying that blacks don't have any technology about South Africa.
[02:12:27.997 --> 02:12:30.678]  And I said, I didn't say that no technology ever came out of there.
[02:12:31.458 --> 02:12:32.559]  And they said, what was this video?
[02:12:32.579 --> 02:12:37.822]  And I go, you mean the video where South African black leaders are calling for genociding whites and taking their land?
[02:12:38.263 --> 02:12:40.124]  And the guy smiled and said, yeah, that video.
[02:12:40.584 --> 02:12:50.091]  And it was like, I was supposed to be guilted and feel bad when I'm in there buying gas and stuff at this little floating gas station out there on the lake.
[02:12:50.811 --> 02:12:56.175]  And it was like this pride that I'm the bad white person and they're the good people and I'm the bad guy.
[02:12:56.195 --> 02:12:57.095]  I mean, I'm gonna get them on the show.
[02:12:57.115 --> 02:12:57.696]  I got the guy's number.
[02:12:57.716 --> 02:12:58.476]  I said, hey, come on in here.
[02:12:58.937 --> 02:12:59.897]  You know, show me what I said.
[02:12:59.937 --> 02:13:00.618]  Show me what I did.
[02:13:01.832 --> 02:13:25.856]  And it's just this thing of, like, everybody's fighting to get into the US or Europe or Australia, but then the communist deputy leader of the Defense Department in South Africa and the current president, you know, are saying, oh, whites, you're not allowed to leave, but if you do, give us all your property, and then calling Australia racist if they take whites, but then African athletes go for the Olympics in Australia or sporting events.
[02:13:26.136 --> 02:13:28.157]  I've got it in the news today, and they're all trying to stay there.
[02:13:28.217 --> 02:13:29.457]  So all I'm saying is,
[02:13:30.637 --> 02:13:39.622]  I've never done anything to anybody and I'm just sick of hearing about it all day and the media beating me over the head and then people acting like they've got some type of status over me because I'm white.
[02:13:39.742 --> 02:13:48.426]  This is the very type of cultural racism that they claim they're fighting and it's just force-fed everywhere and it's disgusting and I'm sick of it.
[02:13:51.277 --> 02:13:51.997]  You're right, Alex.
[02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:54.559]  Class warfare is the name of the game coming up.
[02:13:54.819 --> 02:13:55.880]  And it's going to get bad.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:57.721]  It's part of the class conflict.
[02:13:57.901 --> 02:14:04.364]  And the more they bring in different cultures, incompatible cultures, into Western culture, the easier it's going to be to have.
[02:14:04.444 --> 02:14:06.426]  And you can see Hollywood is just 24-7.
[02:14:06.706 --> 02:14:09.507]  I mean, it's just thousands of movies, shows.
[02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.769]  Everything is just over the top.
[02:14:11.909 --> 02:14:13.069]  But people are rejecting it.
[02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:14.730]  Hollywood's going bankrupt.
[02:14:14.770 --> 02:14:15.791]  CNN's collapsing.
[02:14:15.811 --> 02:14:16.471]  But they don't care.
[02:14:16.491 --> 02:14:17.632]  They just keep pressing it.
[02:14:19.744 --> 02:14:27.146]  Well, I think a lot of their bankruptcy is because of their over-the-top costs, not because a lot of ignorant people aren't going to those movies.
[02:14:27.206 --> 02:14:34.668]  And that's the problem, is that public schooling is probably the greatest danger to us culturally, in that we are destroying Western culture.
[02:14:34.688 --> 02:14:38.109]  We're making religion laughable in public schooling.
[02:14:38.789 --> 02:14:44.351]  We teach them nothing about the Constitution, nothing about the rule of law, other than knee-jerk
[02:14:44.983 --> 02:14:46.725]  Follow government type of rule of law.
[02:14:47.285 --> 02:14:49.307]  So I think public schooling is our greatest danger.
[02:14:49.327 --> 02:14:59.196]  And if I ever have any message, if you really want to change things, you need to get your children out of public schools, start homeschooling them or using private schooling, start organizing yourself into churches.
[02:14:59.256 --> 02:15:08.405]  Because if you continue to lose your children to the public schools, you are not going to be able to save them from the social doctrines, social
[02:15:12.786 --> 02:15:15.991]  Well, there's no doubt this is a scientific plan to bring down civilization.
[02:15:16.311 --> 02:15:18.033]  It's in the WikiLeaks, they admit it, it's amazing.
[02:15:18.354 --> 02:15:22.279]  Joel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:15:22.359 --> 02:15:24.262]  If people can email you, can they get a free copy?
[02:15:25.134 --> 02:15:31.719]  Yes, email me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com and you can get a free sample of the current World Affairs Brief.
[02:15:31.919 --> 02:15:37.342]  Alright, thanks for breaking down the 45 goals of the globalists, 45 goals of communism with us today.
[02:15:37.403 --> 02:15:38.603]  Very important broadcast.
[02:15:38.623 --> 02:15:40.345]  I hope people get it out to everyone they know.
[02:15:40.365 --> 02:15:40.745]  Thank you, sir.
[02:15:41.585 --> 02:15:41.966]  Thank you.
[02:15:43.151 --> 02:15:44.452]  We're covering facts, folks.
[02:15:44.492 --> 02:15:45.313]  That's why they hate us.
[02:15:45.353 --> 02:15:47.175]  We're putting out the blueprint of the globalists.
[02:15:47.215 --> 02:15:48.036]  They think you're dumb.
[02:15:48.096 --> 02:15:49.758]  Or at least they used to think you were dumb and wouldn't care.
[02:15:50.118 --> 02:15:51.019]  So they didn't care about us.
[02:15:51.039 --> 02:15:53.021]  Now they know you care, so they want us shut down.
[02:15:53.642 --> 02:15:56.785]  We'll be back with Leo Zagami from Rome.
[02:15:57.206 --> 02:15:58.147]  Talk about on target.
[02:15:58.828 --> 02:15:59.428]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:02.271 --> 02:16:02.431]  You...
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:12.523]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[02:16:13.244 --> 02:16:14.045]  I wanna rock!
[02:16:17.148 --> 02:16:21.993]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:16:22.113 --> 02:16:28.579]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:16:34.121 --> 02:16:38.622]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:16:39.722 --> 02:16:42.343]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:16:42.403 --> 02:16:43.803]  I can't describe John to tomorrow.
[02:16:43.923 --> 02:16:46.324]  All you gotta do is arm all your best.
[02:16:46.624 --> 02:16:54.986]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:16:55.126 --> 02:16:55.766]  Where's the beat?
[02:16:56.106 --> 02:16:58.107]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:16:59.206 --> 02:17:02.608]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:17:02.869 --> 02:17:10.694]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:17:10.934 --> 02:17:21.782]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:17:23.094 --> 02:17:39.864]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:17:40.124 --> 02:17:46.728]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:17:47.068 --> 02:17:48.189]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:17:48.429 --> 02:17:53.074]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:17:53.194 --> 02:17:57.818]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:17:58.729 --> 02:18:03.412]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:18:03.712 --> 02:18:07.875]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:18:07.915 --> 02:18:10.717]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:18:10.777 --> 02:18:18.262]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:18:18.582 --> 02:18:22.925]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:18:23.225 --> 02:18:28.529]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed this ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:18:29.609 --> 02:18:30.769]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:34.850]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:18:34.890 --> 02:18:40.892]  How do you think the crack crowd gets into the country?
[02:18:40.932 --> 02:18:42.312]  We don't own any planes.
[02:18:42.772 --> 02:18:43.872]  We don't own no ships.
[02:18:44.113 --> 02:18:47.473]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:18:47.713 --> 02:18:54.375]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:18:56.597 --> 02:19:03.960]  The men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.943]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:19:08.983 --> 02:19:16.046]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:19:16.506 --> 02:19:23.309]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran contras
[02:19:23.869 --> 02:19:29.111]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:19:29.871 --> 02:19:35.792]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[02:19:36.373 --> 02:19:41.354]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:19:41.574 --> 02:19:44.755]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:19:45.275 --> 02:19:47.916]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:19:48.636 --> 02:19:52.939]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:19:52.959 --> 02:19:53.239]  Lewinsky.
[02:19:53.839 --> 02:19:55.700]  These allegations are false.
[02:19:56.621 --> 02:20:02.704]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[02:20:06.206 --> 02:20:08.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.303 --> 02:20:32.312]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, an amazing patriot, will be in studio with us for two hours tomorrow.
[02:20:33.033 --> 02:20:35.715]  So I am certainly looking forward to that.
[02:20:35.735 --> 02:20:37.877]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[02:20:38.218 --> 02:20:39.779]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:20:39.859 --> 02:20:40.300]  We've got
[02:20:41.627 --> 02:20:44.731]  About 45 minutes left, going a little bit in the next hour.
[02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:48.455]  Then we have another special guest that is going to be joining us.
[02:20:48.595 --> 02:20:53.121]  We're going to have a lot of live news analysis with Roger Stone as well.
[02:20:55.724 --> 02:20:58.547]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the big announcement.
[02:20:59.488 --> 02:21:00.570]  If you just tuned in,
[02:21:01.721 --> 02:21:11.587]  We've got Leo Zegami, the best-selling author, Vatican insider, somebody who has been so on target with everything going on in the Vatican.
[02:21:11.607 --> 02:21:15.629]  For the 15 years I've been aware of him, it is staggering.
[02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:20.112]  And folks know, I don't just say this about really any of our guests.
[02:21:20.833 --> 02:21:22.814]  The information is just unbelievable.
[02:21:24.006 --> 02:21:42.723]  Five years before we ever heard of this current Pope, he said he'll be your next Pope, and then there'll be another Pope still living at the same time to set the precedent, and then you'll have two Popes at once, and then he will resign later to set the precedent that it's like an office you hold for four to six years.
[02:21:43.243 --> 02:21:45.385]  The Pope announced that yesterday.
[02:21:46.526 --> 02:21:48.307]  He also exposed
[02:21:49.488 --> 02:21:55.270]  Cardinal Pell many years ago as running giant pedophile rings to blackmail the Vatican.
[02:21:55.570 --> 02:22:01.552]  Later it came out in the Guardian that indeed that's how this new black Pope or Jesuit Pope got in.
[02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:08.675]  He was then the first person to report that the trial would be blacked out and that no one would know about it.
[02:22:09.595 --> 02:22:10.656]  At LeoZagami.com.
[02:22:13.376 --> 02:22:16.818]  Days later, weeks later, it all comes out, word for word, what he said.
[02:22:16.878 --> 02:22:21.460]  So, this is so critical because the globalists have totally seized control of the Vatican.
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:28.043]  They're trying to destroy the good elements of the Catholic Church, pro-family, things like that, anti-abortion.
[02:22:28.763 --> 02:22:31.905]  And you have an ecumenical, true Luciferian takeover.
[02:22:32.445 --> 02:22:33.826]  Here is leozugami.com.
[02:22:34.686 --> 02:22:37.767]  The Vatican attempts complete media ban of Cardinal Pell's trial.
[02:22:38.008 --> 02:22:40.709]  That was days before it was then mainstream news.
[02:22:42.405 --> 02:22:47.371]  Pope says he's thought about when it's time to take leave and says that he set the precedent.
[02:22:47.391 --> 02:22:52.557]  These are quotes from the Pope from Vatican City that you can have two Popes or three Popes at once.
[02:22:52.958 --> 02:22:54.720]  Word for word what Leo Zegami has said.
[02:22:55.919 --> 02:22:59.702]  Cardinal Pell's sexual abuse trials may be held in secret.
[02:22:59.762 --> 02:23:03.785]  Now the New York Times, after the Zigami Brexit days ago, confirms that.
[02:23:04.305 --> 02:23:07.788]  Prosecutors seek media ban on trial of papal aide.
[02:23:08.388 --> 02:23:11.770]  This is the guy that delivered little boys to the other pedophile cardinals.
[02:23:12.251 --> 02:23:14.352]  They're not all pedophiles, but this is how the left takes over.
[02:23:15.693 --> 02:23:18.936]  Australia court staffer fired for reading charges against Cardinal Pell.
[02:23:19.256 --> 02:23:21.718]  Even court staffers aren't even allowed to know.
[02:23:22.398 --> 02:23:24.680]  But we know it's hundreds of trafficked children.
[02:23:26.254 --> 02:23:27.015]  But here's the big one.
[02:23:28.016 --> 02:23:32.401]  Pell's trial and other scandals may finally push the Pope to finally resign.
[02:23:32.441 --> 02:23:38.908]  That's the big news is, can we get rid of this evil Pope and not get another counterfeit globalist in there?
[02:23:39.249 --> 02:23:44.855]  And can we push Armageddon and this whole thing down the road a little bit for those of us that love our children?
[02:23:45.135 --> 02:23:46.517]  Because if he isn't satanic,
[02:23:47.708 --> 02:23:54.792]  Calling for open borders and the Islamification of Europe and ordering churches to take down crucifix and put up, you know, Islamic iconography.
[02:23:54.832 --> 02:23:59.494]  If this guy isn't an anti-Christ spirit, then I don't know what is.
[02:23:59.594 --> 02:24:02.556]  Joining us is Leo Zagami, again, from Rome.
[02:24:02.656 --> 02:24:04.357]  Amazing, Leo.
[02:24:04.437 --> 02:24:07.138]  You know everything before it comes out.
[02:24:07.198 --> 02:24:10.040]  And I know of no one else, because I tracked this, that does.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:12.461]  So, amazing job with your sources.
[02:24:12.761 --> 02:24:16.543]  Briefly, without giving away sources, how do you do it and then tell us what's currently happening?
[02:24:18.342 --> 02:24:20.825]  Well, I always stay in touch with my sources.
[02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:35.303]  Even a couple of hours ago I got breaking info regarding the new Grand Master of the Knights of Malta that might ask himself now to resign after there is much discontent in the traditionalist Knights of Malta.
[02:24:35.643 --> 02:24:52.988]  And as you know, also, somebody from the court proceedings regarding Cardinal Pell broke from the internal computer system trying to access information on Cardinal Pell, and that immediately was reported by the court this morning during the trial.
[02:24:53.008 --> 02:25:01.131]  That is assuming, of course, the characteristics of a very important moment for the history of the Church.
[02:25:01.639 --> 02:25:07.101]  And at the same time, in Rome, we have all the Chilean cardinals.
[02:25:07.121 --> 02:25:08.862]  Part of my family comes from Chile.
[02:25:08.882 --> 02:25:12.703]  My grandfather was born in Chile, even if he was of Scottish descent.
[02:25:13.064 --> 02:25:18.206]  And my ex-family house in Valparaiso is even a monastery donated to the Catholic Church.
[02:25:18.226 --> 02:25:21.307]  So I'm very close to the Catholic Church in Chile, which is suffering.
[02:25:21.827 --> 02:25:22.807]  We're good to go.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:45.901]  That he might resign.
[02:25:46.181 --> 02:25:58.586]  But that's because he wants to avoid, of course, also impeachment from his own cardinals that are criticizing everything he has done, which is really putting the Church in a very bad position.
[02:25:58.946 --> 02:26:12.632]  Also here in Italy, in the last few hours, politically, the Church is criticizing both Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, that are trying to do this coalition of populist forces to save Italy.
[02:26:13.012 --> 02:26:24.043]  But the Vatican is against it, and probably they're not going to be able to put together this government, because also the EU is against them, criticizing them even before they start.
[02:26:24.344 --> 02:26:33.093]  So this is a dictatorship, both political and religious, that sees the Vatican embedded with the left-wing worldwide.
[02:26:34.108 --> 02:26:47.988]  It is simply totally transparent and has outraged traditional Catholics, which are the real Catholics out there, who are great people in my experience, really bedrock of fighting corruption, just to see it totally take over via a pedophile scandal.
[02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:52.012]  That I remember you talking about over a decade ago.
[02:26:52.072 --> 02:26:55.535]  I remember like 2005, 6, 7, watching videos of you.
[02:26:55.555 --> 02:26:59.218]  Then I ordered a few of your books and thinking, man, this guy claims he knows it all.
[02:26:59.278 --> 02:27:05.843]  And then seeing that you were accurate because you live in Rome and have family in Chile, where he's from, and have been deeply connected to the church.
[02:27:06.183 --> 02:27:13.428]  So obviously you have a lot of sources of the more traditional conservatives, as I witnessed when I traveled around with you in Rome for days.
[02:27:14.329 --> 02:27:18.572]  All the places you took us into and, you know, the way the guards treated you and all the other things.
[02:27:19.333 --> 02:27:23.256]  But looking at this, I'm concerned that it's like he's finishing his work.
[02:27:23.276 --> 02:27:24.737]  He just took over the Knights of Malta.
[02:27:25.097 --> 02:27:26.678]  He's doing things that haven't happened ever.
[02:27:27.079 --> 02:27:32.443]  He's consolidating and then he kind of goes away and then who, like shark teeth, rolls in behind that.
[02:27:32.463 --> 02:27:35.305]  I mean, I'm really worried if it looks like he's about to finally fall.
[02:27:35.605 --> 02:27:40.429]  What a monstrous counterfeit that what may be coming in in that power struggle.
[02:27:42.608 --> 02:27:45.729]  What might come in is a Pope from Africa.
[02:27:45.829 --> 02:28:05.473]  That is 90% possibility that we get an African Pope, because of course he's from the third world, he's from those places which actually are bringing a major influx of immigrants into Europe, and so they are preparing to receive them.
[02:28:05.693 --> 02:28:11.614]  Pope Francis is in bed with the globalists, so he's of course, he knows what he's doing.
[02:28:11.934 --> 02:28:22.963]  But I think in the last few days he's really having trouble in keeping all this together, because there is major criticism coming within certain establishments.
[02:28:23.223 --> 02:28:30.850]  And I mean, if the Grand Master that has just been nominated for the Knights of Malta resigns, well, that would be the final draw.
[02:28:30.970 --> 02:28:32.171]  I think at that point,
[02:28:32.791 --> 02:28:34.252]  Oh no, stay there.
[02:28:34.492 --> 02:28:37.194]  Word for word, what you said is what he's saying.
[02:28:37.214 --> 02:28:41.638]  He says, I set the precedent with what happened with Ratzinger, so I can do it again.
[02:29:02.313 --> 02:29:04.635]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:29:04.675 --> 02:29:06.396]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:31:03.733 --> 02:31:04.094]  Go ahead.
[02:31:04.974 --> 02:31:06.875]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:06.915 --> 02:31:16.339]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:31:17.399 --> 02:31:20.761]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:31:21.241 --> 02:31:21.501]  Absolutely.
[02:31:44.009 --> 02:31:56.939]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:01.682 --> 02:32:03.684]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:32:03.744 --> 02:32:04.064]  Go ahead.
[02:32:04.477 --> 02:32:06.579]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:32:06.599 --> 02:32:09.621]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:32:10.441 --> 02:32:11.522]  It just gets old, man.
[02:32:11.882 --> 02:32:13.583]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:32:14.304 --> 02:32:16.385]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:32:16.605 --> 02:32:20.608]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:32:20.628 --> 02:32:23.130]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:32:23.931 --> 02:32:26.272]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:32:26.612 --> 02:32:27.733]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:32:27.973 --> 02:32:28.854]  Us being shut down?
[02:32:29.094 --> 02:32:30.135]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:32:30.555 --> 02:32:31.596]  You know what, Alex?
[02:32:31.656 --> 02:32:32.717]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:32:32.737 --> 02:32:33.557]  Hey, Frank!
[02:32:33.838 --> 02:32:39.202]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:32:39.502 --> 02:32:43.785]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:32:44.025 --> 02:32:46.887]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:32:47.168 --> 02:32:47.528]  You understand?
[02:32:47.628 --> 02:32:48.889]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:50.430]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:51.391 --> 02:32:56.315]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:32:57.295 --> 02:32:57.956]  Do you understand?
[02:32:57.976 --> 02:32:59.177]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:33:06.307 --> 02:33:08.923]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.537 --> 02:33:25.458]  You found it.
[02:33:25.738 --> 02:33:28.401]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[02:33:28.801 --> 02:33:30.603]  It's the Infowar.
[02:33:30.883 --> 02:33:33.365]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.465 --> 02:33:37.269]  I mean, you can see what the big megacorporations are doing.
[02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:38.670]  They've exploited the third world.
[02:33:39.671 --> 02:33:41.974]  Then they have Hollywood put out all this race war stuff.
[02:33:42.014 --> 02:33:47.800]  They bring in third world populations, put chips on their shoulders, and then just break down society from there.
[02:33:47.921 --> 02:33:48.762]  This is incredible.
[02:33:48.802 --> 02:33:51.004]  Then the ultra-rich, they're all exempt from it.
[02:33:51.625 --> 02:33:52.906]  Total class warfare.
[02:33:52.926 --> 02:33:54.488]  The Vatican pushing it all.
[02:33:54.508 --> 02:33:56.370]  180 foot walls.
[02:33:56.470 --> 02:33:57.952]  It says Europe can't have any walls.
[02:33:58.112 --> 02:33:58.673]  It's incredible.
[02:34:00.506 --> 02:34:02.827]  We are funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[02:34:02.847 --> 02:34:06.369]  If you're watching or listening to us on local TV stations, please support their sponsors.
[02:34:06.769 --> 02:34:07.729]  Please become a sponsor.
[02:34:07.749 --> 02:34:11.131]  Whatever you do, spread the word about how you're watching or listening.
[02:34:11.611 --> 02:34:17.934]  There is massive censorship going on and attempts to shut us down on the internet, but we do have InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:34:17.954 --> 02:34:21.936]  We are reaching record numbers of people there, thanks to you spreading the word.
[02:34:21.976 --> 02:34:23.916]  So without you, the globalists win.
[02:34:25.477 --> 02:34:26.678]  And at InfoWars Store,
[02:34:28.035 --> 02:34:28.695]  We're good to go.
[02:34:49.003 --> 02:34:51.784]  X2, though, is 25% off because it's already so low-cost.
[02:34:52.284 --> 02:34:54.304]  Very hard to secure the Deep Earth Crystals for that.
[02:34:54.624 --> 02:34:56.785]  This may be our next-to-last run of that.
[02:34:57.565 --> 02:34:58.545]  It is amazing.
[02:34:59.185 --> 02:35:05.727]  We have the other great products, like the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[02:35:05.827 --> 02:35:06.567]  It is amazing.
[02:35:06.887 --> 02:35:08.947]  Go read the thousands of five-star reviews about it.
[02:35:09.527 --> 02:35:13.068]  And the mouthwash that's also fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[02:35:14.248 --> 02:35:16.009]  The three different sizes of immune gargle.
[02:35:16.149 --> 02:35:17.149]  We also have it for children.
[02:35:19.082 --> 02:35:23.066]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:23.667 --> 02:35:28.211]  And again, there's over, let's just go to the regular toothpaste.
[02:35:28.251 --> 02:35:31.675]  I think it's got like 4,000 reviews, five-star reviews, by Power Reviews.
[02:35:32.035 --> 02:35:38.222]  Because if you do the combo pack, that's just a week-old special, where you get all of them together, 50% off and free shipping.
[02:35:39.022 --> 02:35:40.844]  But there's no reviews, so it has zero reviews.
[02:35:40.884 --> 02:35:41.345]  Yeah, look, it has 3,000
[02:35:42.826 --> 02:35:46.670]  400 plus five-star reviews on third-party sites.
[02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:48.231]  No one's got that.
[02:35:48.551 --> 02:35:52.434]  I really should be reading these reviews more on air, but just see why they're so great.
[02:35:52.454 --> 02:35:59.320]  There's no fillers, no additives, and then you're funding the tip of the spear in the face of the globalists and all these guests we have on.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:01.182]  I have the guests on that are accurate.
[02:36:02.293 --> 02:36:04.374]  I have the Gaston that have proven they know what they're talking about.
[02:36:04.734 --> 02:36:06.535]  I have the Gaston that are being persecuted.
[02:36:06.935 --> 02:36:08.476]  I have the Gaston that are changing the world.
[02:36:08.836 --> 02:36:10.357]  I have... That's what we're doing.
[02:36:10.437 --> 02:36:12.458]  We are saying somebody's got to do it.
[02:36:12.819 --> 02:36:15.240]  Somebody's got to stand up to Soros and Hillary.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.141]  Somebody's got to say no to them.
[02:36:17.521 --> 02:36:18.402]  Somebody's got to do it.
[02:36:18.422 --> 02:36:18.822]  And we're here.
[02:36:18.842 --> 02:36:20.423]  We're going all the way to the end.
[02:36:20.443 --> 02:36:20.883]  And you know what?
[02:36:23.356 --> 02:36:33.999]  Leo Zegami is the first person up there saying this Jesuit, communist, globalist was going to take over using pedophilia and that his right hand man was a pedophile procurer, a Renfield.
[02:36:34.139 --> 02:36:37.200]  It's all, he's now indicted, he's in court, it's all secret.
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:43.982]  So now that you told us how you knew all this Leo, because you, I'm not just saying this, you are, when it comes to the Vatican, you're the most accurate guy out there.
[02:36:44.722 --> 02:36:48.205]  And I know you've been part of the branch of the Illuminati, the real deal, the whole nine yards.
[02:36:48.506 --> 02:36:53.330]  They've exposed it as a Christian Illuminist, which is what Christ really did.
[02:36:53.350 --> 02:36:55.232]  They're the satanic counterfeit of that.
[02:36:55.933 --> 02:36:59.456]  Everything they do is a counterfeit, so there's always a real thing, and they're the counterfeit.
[02:36:59.836 --> 02:37:07.363]  Then people see the real thing, and they think, oh wait, he must be the bad thing, because the bad thing's masquerading as the real thing, like Glenn Bechtraub's doing with me or Ben Shapiro.
[02:37:08.407 --> 02:37:09.948]  But you have laid this out.
[02:37:10.409 --> 02:37:11.850]  You have predicted it all.
[02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:17.274]  So we're really listening to you right now, because even if you're not a Catholic, folks, this affects Europe, the whole world, globalism.
[02:37:17.294 --> 02:37:20.016]  This guy is one of the main weapons being used.
[02:37:20.076 --> 02:37:22.037]  He says he wants fake news banned.
[02:37:22.077 --> 02:37:26.641]  He runs Georgetown, savagely suing us, calling for us to be shut down.
[02:37:27.181 --> 02:37:30.904]  I mean, we are under attack by the literal Jesuit institution.
[02:37:31.745 --> 02:37:34.107]  Hillary called herself a Jew-itical thinker.
[02:37:35.087 --> 02:37:38.089]  Well, my god, if that's Catholic, then I'll eat my horse.
[02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:40.331]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:37:40.411 --> 02:37:42.072]  So you predicted it all.
[02:37:42.872 --> 02:37:44.514]  You said they'd have a secret trial.
[02:37:44.614 --> 02:37:45.514]  It's now happening.
[02:37:46.255 --> 02:37:47.676]  So let's move into this trial.
[02:37:47.796 --> 02:38:01.445]  Cardinal Pell, this ghoulish procurer, what he's actually known for doing that's come out before, that you first broke, that they've now sealed from the media and even the court clerk, criminal charges for looking at it, what you're supposed to do.
[02:38:01.885 --> 02:38:03.146]  This is unbelievable.
[02:38:03.206 --> 02:38:03.947]  So again,
[02:38:05.188 --> 02:38:13.916]  How are they even having a kangaroo trial or court in Australia of the pedophile Pope's procurer for compromising folks?
[02:38:13.996 --> 02:38:17.179]  And does this Pope like little boys, little girls, or is it just men?
[02:38:17.199 --> 02:38:19.662]  Because I know a lot of them don't actually have sex with the kids.
[02:38:19.942 --> 02:38:21.684]  They just use it to control everybody under them.
[02:38:22.084 --> 02:38:23.285]  And so we should also talk about that.
[02:38:23.345 --> 02:38:23.906]  Leo Zegani.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:35.948]  Well, as you know, there is an international pedophile ring, and part of this pedophile ring is even run by terrorists like ISIS and people like al-Baghdadi.
[02:38:36.329 --> 02:38:46.037]  Now, the information that in the Vatican is circulating in the last few hours is that al-Baghdadi is somewhere in Syria, protected by the Vatican and the Americans, and he's still alive.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:55.305]  And this is an information that I got also this afternoon from Luciano Consorti, who is a member of Desi and a journalist in Italy.
[02:38:55.325 --> 02:38:58.046]  And this is, of course, big news.
[02:38:58.106 --> 02:39:01.268]  McCain is apparently protecting, of course, Baghdadi.
[02:39:01.288 --> 02:39:05.650]  But, of course, McCain is also very sick in the last few days.
[02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:09.152]  And his health is deteriorating.
[02:39:09.472 --> 02:39:12.194]  So there is a situation here where
[02:39:12.634 --> 02:39:19.757]  The ISIS has helped the Vatican and the Mondialists pushing these migrants towards the invasion of Europe.
[02:39:19.797 --> 02:39:22.138]  And by the way, interrupting so much, it sounds insane.
[02:39:22.458 --> 02:39:27.820]  The Pope, what, six months ago and a year ago, said ISIS is like Jesus spreading the Gospel.
[02:39:29.767 --> 02:39:31.449]  Yes, unfortunately yes.
[02:39:31.509 --> 02:39:32.390]  That is his words.
[02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:33.931]  It's scandalous.
[02:39:34.251 --> 02:39:45.362]  And it's very scandalous that al-Baghdadi, who is said to be dead, is not dead at all, and is actually hidden in a secret base in Syria, protected by the Americans, because
[02:39:45.882 --> 02:39:48.025]  There is a compromise here being made.
[02:39:48.065 --> 02:39:51.149]  By the way, I was told that by high-level army sources months ago.
[02:39:51.169 --> 02:39:52.211]  I never went on air with it.
[02:39:52.651 --> 02:39:53.933]  Lay it out slow for folks.
[02:39:54.374 --> 02:39:55.075]  Secret U.S.
[02:39:55.115 --> 02:39:56.697]  bases protecting al-Qaeda ISIS.
[02:39:57.037 --> 02:39:58.640]  Trump doesn't even know this or understand it.
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:39:59.921]  He keeps ordering it shut down.
[02:40:00.362 --> 02:40:00.883]  Explain this.
[02:40:02.887 --> 02:40:25.527]  Well of course there is this basis and they are protecting al-Baghdadi because he's counted as a resource against the Russians, which of course are still the enemies of the Liberals and the enemies, number one, of the Democrats, at least in this massive propaganda effort that every day brings in Russia into the equation.
[02:40:26.147 --> 02:40:31.670]  So we should, as you said many times, ally with Christian Russia instead of with the terrorists.
[02:40:31.930 --> 02:40:52.141]  But al-Baghdadi is also financed by Saudi Arabia and of course this is also part of the military-industrial complex and the work that unfortunately they do behind the scenes that is limiting the efforts of Trump that is trying, if possible, to liberate and free himself from the military-industrial complex.
[02:40:53.423 --> 02:40:55.524]  Why ally with Al-Qaeda and ISIS?
[02:40:55.585 --> 02:40:59.507]  Why ally with people that sell sexual girls into sex slavery and kill them?
[02:41:00.067 --> 02:41:00.548]  Why?
[02:41:00.708 --> 02:41:01.068]  Why?
[02:41:01.208 --> 02:41:06.551]  And they have a leftist Pope allying with a group that throws gays off buildings and the left doesn't care, they love it!
[02:41:08.012 --> 02:41:16.077]  They love it and people like Cardinal Pell and their pedophiliary get a lot of their sexual slaves
[02:41:16.431 --> 02:41:20.694]  From these migrants that arrive into Europe without any documents.
[02:41:21.114 --> 02:41:27.758]  Children that are put into slavery and under the control of priests, of bishops, of cardinals.
[02:41:28.219 --> 02:41:30.300]  And, of course, they love it.
[02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:33.182]  And they actually make even money on top of these migrants.
[02:41:33.342 --> 02:41:35.764]  That is, of course, financed by the EU.
[02:41:36.084 --> 02:41:39.066]  For each migrant, they get a certain amount of money daily.
[02:41:39.426 --> 02:41:45.170]  So each priest, each bishop who involves himself with the migrant business is sitting on gold.
[02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:47.211]  And by the way, you're so on target.
[02:41:47.251 --> 02:41:51.213]  Here in the U.S., it was the Vatican was caught five years ago with Obama.
[02:41:51.253 --> 02:41:56.756]  Every family that comes in, they give it to a liberal Catholic family or a liberal family, and they get
[02:42:12.464 --> 02:42:16.965]  $8,000 a month for three people in groups of three, and then they exploit them.
[02:42:17.005 --> 02:42:20.986]  They make them get jobs and then take part of their money that's kicked back to the Democrats.
[02:42:21.026 --> 02:42:21.686]  It's slavery.
[02:42:22.106 --> 02:42:24.007]  And I was reading about the same thing in Europe.
[02:42:25.547 --> 02:42:27.427]  The police will make people house these folks.
[02:42:27.467 --> 02:42:28.228]  They don't even get the money.
[02:42:28.708 --> 02:42:33.429]  But the bureaucrats actually then hold on to the welfare check that's supposedly going to the migrants.
[02:42:33.749 --> 02:42:37.750]  They use them, and then they grab the little girls and little boys they want, and they disappear.
[02:42:37.790 --> 02:42:38.530]  There's no record.
[02:42:39.370 --> 02:42:41.472]  I mean this is just, this is like vampires.
[02:42:41.533 --> 02:42:44.896]  This is unbelievable with Leo Zegami.
[02:42:44.916 --> 02:42:45.296]  Look at this.
[02:42:45.497 --> 02:42:49.881]  Irish pressure to house migrants in spare bedrooms, vacation homes.
[02:42:50.241 --> 02:42:52.864]  That's up at europewars.com from Dan Lyman.
[02:42:53.445 --> 02:42:58.910]  That ties in with no whites allowed day, second year at Evergreen State University.
[02:42:58.930 --> 02:43:00.452]  That's the opposite of Martin Luther King.
[02:43:00.472 --> 02:43:01.853]  This is total racism.
[02:43:02.694 --> 02:43:11.716]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.776 --> 02:43:20.019]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:20.179 --> 02:43:24.860]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:31.785]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:31.845 --> 02:43:38.930]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:39.010 --> 02:43:40.691]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:45.892]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:46.052 --> 02:43:50.394]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.534 --> 02:43:53.775]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.915 --> 02:44:00.056]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:44:00.216 --> 02:44:01.897]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:02.657 --> 02:44:07.120]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:15.465]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:15.585 --> 02:44:17.226]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:44:18.183 --> 02:44:24.145]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:24.805 --> 02:44:28.366]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:29.227 --> 02:44:37.229]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:37.809 --> 02:44:45.492]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:46.292 --> 02:44:50.063]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:50.625 --> 02:44:51.427]  It's Alpha Power.
[02:44:51.487 --> 02:44:54.596]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:55.664 --> 02:45:10.534]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:10.954 --> 02:45:16.318]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:16.618 --> 02:45:18.159]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:18.459 --> 02:45:19.780]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:24.402]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alva Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:24.943 --> 02:45:29.245]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:29.265 --> 02:45:30.626]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:31.426 --> 02:45:37.649]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:40.111]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:40.691 --> 02:45:42.272]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:42.292 --> 02:45:43.413]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:43.453 --> 02:45:45.114]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:45:48.015 --> 02:45:48.876]  But here's an example.
[02:45:49.697 --> 02:45:56.744]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:57.305 --> 02:45:59.007]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:59.487 --> 02:46:05.653]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:06.334 --> 02:46:11.436]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:11.716 --> 02:46:20.059]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:20.459 --> 02:46:21.480]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:24.221]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:40.889]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:41.309 --> 02:46:50.271]  So you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:50.611 --> 02:46:52.631]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:53.011 --> 02:46:58.492]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[02:46:58.532 --> 02:46:59.132]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:59.172 --> 02:47:00.372]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.355 --> 02:47:19.597]  Story's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:47:21.198 --> 02:47:22.099]  Boils it all down.
[02:47:22.759 --> 02:47:23.840]  Goes back five years ago.
[02:47:24.221 --> 02:47:28.364]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:30.406]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.006 --> 02:47:32.047]  Skip Daniel's story.
[02:47:32.127 --> 02:47:35.730]  InfoWars broke news that Obama administration armed ISIS in Syria.
[02:47:36.611 --> 02:47:45.738]  Four years after InfoWars broke the story, Fox News lays out how Obama slash Hillary armed Al Qaeda and created ISIS.
[02:47:46.818 --> 02:47:47.538]  Out of Benghazi.
[02:47:48.399 --> 02:47:53.302]  Powerful breakdown, big article, with all the videos, all the history, all the CIA whistleblowers.
[02:47:53.982 --> 02:47:58.624]  Tosh Plummey's got to live in South America right now, in a hidden location because of this.
[02:47:59.785 --> 02:48:01.286]  And I'm just saying it like it's no big deal.
[02:48:03.047 --> 02:48:07.309]  Like Leo Zegami, they've grabbed him, put him in jail when he was leading in polls to be an Italian senator.
[02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:09.110]  I mean, this is real.
[02:48:09.130 --> 02:48:10.171]  I'm not up here tooting my horn.
[02:48:11.266 --> 02:48:12.247]  I'm fighting pedophiles.
[02:48:12.808 --> 02:48:13.949]  Don't tell me I'm a hero.
[02:48:14.449 --> 02:48:15.530]  I'm fighting devil worshippers.
[02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:16.271]  I better be.
[02:48:16.291 --> 02:48:18.413]  I feel good when I'm doing it.
[02:48:18.433 --> 02:48:19.234]  I feel close to God.
[02:48:19.254 --> 02:48:20.195]  People call it God-fearing.
[02:48:20.795 --> 02:48:24.799]  What that means is you can feel when God's Spirit's getting closer or further away.
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:27.662]  And you feel when the Holy Spirit's close, that's where you want to be.
[02:48:27.682 --> 02:48:31.205]  So you become like a heat-seeking missile.
[02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:35.550]  Towards fighting evil.
[02:48:37.082 --> 02:48:38.524]  Because that's the reality of it.
[02:48:38.984 --> 02:48:48.275]  By the way, I just got some really shocking, disturbing footage dealing with Starbucks that nobody's really seen yet that we're gonna play coming up in the next segment.
[02:48:48.636 --> 02:48:51.059]  Viewer discretion advised and Roger Stone's gonna join me.
[02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:53.862]  But we got about nine, ten minutes
[02:48:55.316 --> 02:48:56.197]  Thank you for having me.
[02:49:18.851 --> 02:49:35.309]  Well, we have a situation whereby this Pope has been installed by the left-wing Mongolists to destroy the Christian faith, to destroy the last remains of the Catholic faith after the Second Vatican Council.
[02:49:36.073 --> 02:49:38.154]  After this Pope, nothing will be the same.
[02:49:38.434 --> 02:49:50.801]  Like we said earlier on, if he resigns and, like he announced, makes this office like any other secular office, the magic of the papacy will end.
[02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:57.345]  And gradually, of course, they want to end the whole of Christianity, because they want to embrace a one-world religion.
[02:49:57.918 --> 02:50:11.702]  Which is rather different, and is based on a more New Age sort of approach, where you put together all these faiths, and at the same time they use Islam as their Trojan horse, as we said other times.
[02:50:12.543 --> 02:50:23.386]  On Tuesday, this guy who is the head of the European Home Affairs Commission, Dimitris Avampoulos, he basically had the courage
[02:50:23.706 --> 02:50:34.773]  To criticize the upcoming government, which is trying to become a government, it's not even yet a government, saying that Italy can't change their migrant policies.
[02:50:35.393 --> 02:50:37.314]  It forbids Italy from changing.
[02:50:37.435 --> 02:50:41.217]  And even the president of Italy went on record saying
[02:50:41.578 --> 02:50:41.798]  I don't
[02:51:00.679 --> 02:51:13.546]  This is of course a dictatorship of the EU which we have to get rid of and is becoming increasingly dangerous and of course is backed by the Catholic Church which is all the way in bed with them.
[02:51:16.067 --> 02:51:16.347]  Wow.
[02:51:18.028 --> 02:51:22.831]  So what can the average person on the planet do when you've got this ridiculous anti-Christian Pope
[02:51:24.099 --> 02:51:28.301]  As they make their global push to open the borders up to Islam, and they're making their move right now.
[02:51:28.881 --> 02:51:32.903]  Is this a rebuff of the globalists that their little precious fake Pope is in trouble?
[02:51:35.264 --> 02:51:43.348]  Well, I like the words that Matteo Sorghini, the Italian politician, had the courage to tell after the interference from Europe.
[02:51:43.648 --> 02:51:48.350]  They said, we don't want unacceptable interference by unelected officials.
[02:51:48.810 --> 02:51:52.772]  Like Donald J. Trump said, here in Europe we have unelected people
[02:51:53.354 --> 02:52:06.001]  Imposing their own views, liberal views, and nobody is actually aligning with them because every single election in the last few months has proven that Europeans don't want these liberals to have control of the whole show.
[02:52:06.562 --> 02:52:13.966]  So we really need to change things and in America we have Donald J. Trump who is fighting all this and fighting also the pedophilia
[02:52:14.727 --> 02:52:20.392]  And sexual trafficking, that of course we have also seen in Hollywood.
[02:52:20.633 --> 02:52:23.375]  The recent scandals have proven once again what has happened.
[02:52:23.415 --> 02:52:28.120]  By the way, Trump has ten times the arrest of pedophiles, rolling up Hollywood sex cults.
[02:52:28.601 --> 02:52:31.844]  I mean, he's been delivering on this, and I got this from insiders.
[02:52:31.864 --> 02:52:33.325]  I haven't broke this yet, but I'll do it now.
[02:52:34.567 --> 02:52:34.967]  The whole
[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:41.565]  Analytica, Chambers Analytica thing, that's all really connected to Eric Prince, I've been told.
[02:52:41.585 --> 02:52:45.369]  And they're getting ready to, I was told they're getting ready to have the Justice Department go after him.
[02:52:45.449 --> 02:52:47.732]  Not Trump's Justice Department, but Obama's.
[02:52:48.192 --> 02:52:51.175]  And that they're getting ready to go after that whole situation.
[02:52:52.337 --> 02:52:54.359]  So this whole thing is just blowing up.
[02:52:55.856 --> 02:53:02.242]  Also, the left wing here in Europe is increasingly anti-Semitic, and this is very negative.
[02:53:02.562 --> 02:53:18.457]  I mean, anti-Semitic is the most negative thing you can imagine, and that's why Corbyn is losing in Great Britain, but also here in Italy we have a lot of left-wing parties that are becoming more and more anti-Semitic.
[02:53:19.257 --> 02:53:29.784]  Using the excuse of the latest problems that we had after the establishment of the embassy in Jerusalem, they are increasing their criticism towards not only Israel, but the Jewish people.
[02:53:30.164 --> 02:53:33.466]  And I think this is something that we have to immediately stop.
[02:53:33.507 --> 02:53:39.751]  But it's not counteracted enough because the left-wing politicians... I was about to say, what is the left thinking?
[02:53:39.771 --> 02:53:44.233]  Because they'll say that, oh, if you don't like global government, it's secretly racist.
[02:53:45.254 --> 02:53:48.716]  Then you've got Germany saying to Jews, don't wear yarmulkes.
[02:53:49.116 --> 02:53:52.998]  They're telling women on, you know, don't go out wearing miniskirts at night.
[02:53:53.378 --> 02:53:55.439]  It's just cater, cater, cater to the Muslims.
[02:53:55.799 --> 02:53:57.060]  This is joke level.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:58.861]  The left has gone completely insane.
[02:53:59.141 --> 02:54:06.125]  But I guess they haven't because it's a unified global plan to red carpet all these third world populations, the Muslims, everybody.
[02:54:06.485 --> 02:54:07.745]  Where do they expect this to go?
[02:54:07.785 --> 02:54:11.007]  I guess just the average liberal will say, OK, I won't wear a miniskirt.
[02:54:11.047 --> 02:54:14.269]  The average Jew will say, OK, I'm not going to wear a yarmulke because I don't want to
[02:54:16.290 --> 02:54:26.115]  Well, it is ridiculous, but you have to understand that Netanyahu is under attack by liberal forces in Israel that's tied with Rothschild, with George Soros, and that are ready to overthrow
[02:54:36.121 --> 02:54:48.671]  The Netanyahu, when his time, especially his mission, is going to be considered concluded, then they will go on to something else.
[02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:56.477]  We have to understand that there is liberal forces within Israel that are siding with the Clintons, Obama, George Soros.
[02:54:56.957 --> 02:55:12.381]  And those forces are the most negative forces of Zionism, not the ones that have established a state that in the end has guaranteed in any way a civilization and a way of life that is unprecedented in that part of the world.
[02:55:12.421 --> 02:55:17.462]  And we have to admit that in that part of the world every other state is still in the
[02:55:18.422 --> 02:55:22.885]  Barbarians who are making women secondary citizens.
[02:55:22.945 --> 02:55:35.114]  I was about to say, when does the left roll out the red carpet and have Linda Sorcer lead their events and then Israel's this little tiny country and you read the Soros documents he wants to overthrow it and he's got a bunch of the Jews in Israel actually for it.
[02:55:35.754 --> 02:55:37.736]  I mean it's suicidal.
[02:55:37.776 --> 02:55:38.997]  These people are crazy.
[02:55:41.189 --> 02:55:56.342]  They are crazy but with the support of Pope Francis and with the support of the Vatican they are really getting ready for June when they will meet up in Geneva with the World Council of Religions and establish the guidelines for the One World Religions.
[02:55:56.643 --> 02:56:05.951]  These people are really following a plan and of course after that we might see finally the resignation of this post as we have anticipated.
[02:56:05.971 --> 02:56:07.832]  So that's a global crisis?
[02:56:08.593 --> 02:56:11.761]  Just like the Rockefellers helped start World War II, they admitted to start the UN.
[02:56:12.121 --> 02:56:15.449]  A global crisis for a global solution.
[02:56:16.231 --> 02:56:17.334]  And you're saying that's what they're pushing?
[02:56:18.615 --> 02:56:24.718]  Well, they're pushing towards substituting the UN with a World Council of Religions.
[02:56:25.499 --> 02:56:35.564]  That, of course, will then deal in a very different way that we are used nowadays, where secular powers are dealing with each other.
[02:56:35.624 --> 02:56:42.948]  Imagine if suddenly the people in power are all religious fanatics, each representing their own faction.
[02:56:43.008 --> 02:56:46.050]  Exactly, so they're doing the opposite of America, separation of church and state.
[02:56:46.570 --> 02:56:47.471]  They're making their move.
[02:56:47.491 --> 02:56:49.473]  They know the Muslims are going to be 3 billion people soon.
[02:56:49.754 --> 02:56:50.454]  They can out-vote.
[02:56:50.474 --> 02:56:56.281]  They're going to trick us into this ecumenical global ruling system, as they've said, and then they've got us.
[02:56:57.751 --> 02:57:09.314]  And the Vatican is ready to change sides because they have already trained Jesuits to Islam and they have infiltrated and collaborated with Muslim leaders like Fethullah Gulen, for example.
[02:57:09.354 --> 02:57:13.336]  And that's why Catholic churches and others are getting rid of the crosses and bringing the Muslims in.
[02:57:13.696 --> 02:57:15.156]  You can see the total double cross.
[02:57:15.476 --> 02:57:16.517]  Unbelievable!
[02:57:16.857 --> 02:57:18.317]  Leo Zegami, you're so on target.
[02:57:18.357 --> 02:57:19.217]  LeoZegami.com.

[02:57:23.039 --> 02:57:24.079]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:57:25.051 --> 02:57:27.833]  Wow, man, that is just... because I research this stuff constantly.
[02:57:27.853 --> 02:57:30.234]  That guy is so on, and this is so incredible.
[02:57:30.634 --> 02:57:32.095]  We're gonna be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:57:32.115 --> 02:57:34.936]  We're having to blurt out this footage that happened at a big coffee shop.
[02:57:35.497 --> 02:57:42.320]  People want him to use the bathroom, and they got a new thing where they crap on the floor and, like, throw the poop at the person making coffee.
[02:57:43.081 --> 02:57:45.402]  And hey, if you don't put it in the coffee and drink it, you're a racist.
[02:57:45.902 --> 02:57:46.843]  So that's coming up.
[02:57:47.183 --> 02:57:48.904]  Will Starbucks serve poop next?
[02:57:56.897 --> 02:58:05.659]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[02:58:06.079 --> 02:58:13.461]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:58:35.871 --> 02:58:43.313]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[02:58:43.333 --> 02:58:48.155]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[02:58:48.255 --> 02:58:48.875]  As you age,
[02:58:49.215 --> 02:58:49.675]  We all do.
[02:58:49.895 --> 02:58:54.037]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[02:58:54.057 --> 02:58:55.458]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[02:58:55.658 --> 02:58:59.580]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:07.283]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[02:59:08.104 --> 02:59:17.090]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[02:59:17.270 --> 02:59:25.416]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[02:59:25.516 --> 02:59:26.737]  It is Alpha Power.
[02:59:26.777 --> 02:59:27.718]  It is back in stock.
[02:59:27.758 --> 02:59:34.663]  It is one of the biggest, best, most favorite products on InformalStore.com, and it's back in stock right now at 25% off.
[02:59:34.723 --> 02:59:36.644]  Go and read the five-star review.
[02:59:36.664 --> 02:59:39.187]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.427 --> 03:00:21.714]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.236 --> 03:00:30.545]  You know, I remember when I was about 10 years old listening to NPR and they were playing
[03:00:32.901 --> 03:00:37.325]  Political speeches by white supremacists criticizing it, and they were cussing.
[03:00:38.025 --> 03:00:41.788]  And I said, Mom, how are they cussing on NPR in Dallas?
[03:00:42.529 --> 03:00:44.511]  And she said, Son, that's documentary.
[03:00:45.131 --> 03:00:46.732]  And when I took some RTF, they taught that.
[03:00:46.752 --> 03:00:53.398]  That's why PBS, during a family hour, if it's deemed as historic, and what was really said, not as profane, it's played.
[03:00:54.219 --> 03:01:01.444]  Now, they've got stuff on TV now, sex acts, cussing, everything else that goes on.
[03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:05.561]  On mainline broadcast TV, and nobody complains about that.
[03:01:05.601 --> 03:01:11.742]  But the left, if we show a live street view, and somebody flips somebody off, they file complaints.
[03:01:12.082 --> 03:01:13.923]  Even though the NFL can do it, nobody gets in trouble.
[03:01:14.143 --> 03:01:14.883]  This is not intentional.
[03:01:16.323 --> 03:01:26.886]  But here on air now, I'm going to play this, unblurred out, because this is what Democrats do, and this just happened, and this is played on
[03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:31.670]  The Province.com up in British Columbia.
[03:01:32.111 --> 03:01:33.952]  Then we're going to go to Breaking Bad with Roger Stone.
[03:01:34.612 --> 03:01:35.433]  This is what's going on.
[03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:45.813]  I can't even read this headline.
[03:01:46.173 --> 03:01:50.334]  Woman detained after feces flinging incident at Laney Tim Hortons.
[03:01:50.354 --> 03:01:52.295]  That's like their Starbucks.
[03:01:52.875 --> 03:01:56.636]  So headline, the Starbucks of Canada faces feces flinging woman.
[03:01:56.956 --> 03:01:59.276]  And she comes in and says, can I use the bathroom?
[03:01:59.556 --> 03:02:00.936]  I don't think she looks black or Hispanic.
[03:02:00.956 --> 03:02:01.817]  She looks like a white lady.
[03:02:02.877 --> 03:02:04.617]  Who was that white woman thought she was black?
[03:02:07.478 --> 03:02:07.938]  What was her name?
[03:02:10.771 --> 03:02:11.832]  Rachel Dolezal.
[03:02:12.652 --> 03:02:14.773]  So you've got this Rachel Dolezal type lady.
[03:02:15.734 --> 03:02:17.595]  She walks in, she says, can I use your bathroom?
[03:02:18.956 --> 03:02:19.536]  They go, no.
[03:02:20.236 --> 03:02:23.658]  One thing I like about Starbucks, and I never really go there, is they do have the door locked.
[03:02:23.678 --> 03:02:24.398]  You gotta get a key.
[03:02:24.679 --> 03:02:35.104]  So the bathroom isn't looking like someone ate, you know, 85 buckets of beef and beans and then went in there and spewed projectile diarrhea all over the wall.
[03:02:35.164 --> 03:02:37.886]  And that is the thing about Starbucks, their bathrooms are okay.
[03:02:40.592 --> 03:02:46.699]  This woman walks in to SJW Virtue Signal, and they say, no, you can't use the bathroom.
[03:02:46.719 --> 03:02:58.232]  So she squats, viewer discretion advised, she squats, she uses the bathroom, and then throws it in an assault against the person behind the counter.
[03:02:59.226 --> 03:03:02.807]  Now, the head of Starbucks has said that he's going to let everybody use their bathrooms for free.
[03:03:03.187 --> 03:03:06.668]  Well, that's one more reason not to go to Starbucks, let me assure you.
[03:03:06.769 --> 03:03:08.669]  So, yeah, this looks like a white woman to me.
[03:03:09.129 --> 03:03:16.372]  The perfect SJW crazy person who wants to virtue signal by squatting and crapping on the ground.
[03:03:17.694 --> 03:03:20.115]  Paul Watson has compared liberals to, like, toddlers throwing fits.
[03:03:20.135 --> 03:03:25.958]  Well, let me tell you, only the worst toddlers, and of course monkeys at the zoo, throw crap at you.
[03:03:25.978 --> 03:03:30.080]  So, we're going to roll this, viewer discretion advised, this is documentary format.
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:32.261]  We're going to show you the leftist right here.
[03:03:32.281 --> 03:03:33.702]  What's obscene is we put up with these people.
[03:03:34.122 --> 03:03:35.022]  Let's roll it right now.
[03:03:35.142 --> 03:03:35.843]  No, no, no, no.
[03:03:36.343 --> 03:03:36.683]  Roll it!
[03:03:36.703 --> 03:03:37.644]  We're going to roll it right now.
[03:03:39.224 --> 03:03:40.345]  So, she starts yelling at him.
[03:03:40.365 --> 03:03:41.085]  There's no audio.
[03:03:42.366 --> 03:03:43.466]  She grabs some napkins.
[03:03:43.987 --> 03:03:45.167]  She's not about to touch it herself.
[03:03:49.249 --> 03:03:51.571]  He does this, and then throws it at him, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:51.771 --> 03:03:52.552]  He's a white lady.
[03:03:52.912 --> 03:03:53.433]  There you go.
[03:03:54.114 --> 03:03:55.054]  And then throws it at him.
[03:03:55.615 --> 03:03:56.376]  Now there you go.
[03:03:56.916 --> 03:04:04.223]  And that's what they want Starbucks and everywhere else to do, is just let crazy people come in and do whatever they do in your bathrooms.
[03:04:04.243 --> 03:04:05.484]  Go shoot heroin up.
[03:04:05.504 --> 03:04:06.925]  I'm not saying she's doing it, but they do it.
[03:04:07.306 --> 03:04:09.308]  Junkies use bathrooms, everybody knows that.
[03:04:09.588 --> 03:04:10.489]  Homeless use them.
[03:04:11.109 --> 03:04:13.591]  And I can't tell you how many times I went swimming at Barton Springs.
[03:04:14.645 --> 03:04:17.367]  And I'd go swim a mile, and it'd be 7 a.m.
[03:04:17.387 --> 03:04:17.887]  when I was done.
[03:04:17.947 --> 03:04:24.951]  I'd walk in and try to use their bathroom, and there'd be homeless in there shooting up and diarrhea everywhere, and I would just leave and, you know, drive home.
[03:04:27.052 --> 03:04:27.992]  That's what goes on.
[03:04:28.232 --> 03:04:29.233]  That's what happens here.
[03:04:29.273 --> 03:04:30.173]  This is the mental illness.
[03:04:30.213 --> 03:04:36.317]  So, this woman has just virtue-signaled that, you know, you're gonna let her use the bathroom without buying something.
[03:04:37.034 --> 03:04:38.635]  Or she should have just said, you know, let me have it.
[03:04:38.655 --> 03:04:41.637]  But no, she comes in reportedly and says, can I use the bathroom for free?
[03:04:41.718 --> 03:04:41.918]  No.
[03:04:42.398 --> 03:04:43.339]  She's heard about this in the news.
[03:04:43.359 --> 03:04:45.781]  Well, she goes, I'm going to virtue signal right now.
[03:04:45.801 --> 03:04:49.603]  I'm going to take a big old dump on the ground and then I'm going to throw it at you.
[03:04:50.084 --> 03:04:52.385]  That's how the liberals do it today in America.
[03:04:52.706 --> 03:04:57.990]  This has been aired for documentary purposes so we can see what a deranged leftist looks like.
[03:04:58.290 --> 03:05:00.912]  And I guarantee when they find out who she is, she is a liberal.
[03:05:04.437 --> 03:05:05.178]  I'm so excited.
[03:05:05.258 --> 03:05:14.804]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:15.384 --> 03:05:23.690]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:32.676]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:34.777 --> 03:05:42.864]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:43.004 --> 03:05:53.874]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:54.394 --> 03:05:55.675]  It is amazing!
[03:05:57.077 --> 03:06:02.041]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:15.313 --> 03:06:17.474]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:17.934 --> 03:06:23.175]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:26.776 --> 03:06:35.638]  Well, Roger Stone takes over, ladies and gentlemen, and he's got big, as in capital B, IG News.
[03:06:36.969 --> 03:06:38.010]  Mueller is in trouble.
[03:06:38.110 --> 03:06:39.070]  Mueller is cornered.
[03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:44.012]  Mueller has been caught engaging in all sorts of crimes, his own connections to Russian oligarchs.
[03:06:44.413 --> 03:06:47.854]  Sure, we told you that two years ago, but now it's in the Hill, the New York Times.
[03:06:47.954 --> 03:06:48.915]  What's he gonna do?
[03:06:49.855 --> 03:06:53.477]  What's he gonna do when reality comes for him and as it closes in?
[03:06:53.537 --> 03:07:01.241]  Well, Roger Stone, who Mueller said weeks ago is the main focus now, his main hope of finding a Russian in the woodpile.
[03:07:01.981 --> 03:07:03.622]  Roger, give us the big breaking news.
[03:07:04.841 --> 03:07:26.205]  Well, Alex, at least three major news outlets have informed me that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has dropped subpoenas on my employees, my associates, and some of my vendors for both documents and potentially testimony before the grand jury.
[03:07:26.727 --> 03:07:31.870]  At least one of my employees is under heavy physical surveillance.
[03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:40.414]  Very clearly, the special counsel is now in my email, reading my text messages, monitoring my phone calls.
[03:07:41.475 --> 03:07:44.556]  This is not an investigation.
[03:07:44.576 --> 03:07:46.577]  This is an inquisition.
[03:07:47.118 --> 03:07:51.700]  As I have said many, many times, I have no evidence nor knowledge
[03:07:52.213 --> 03:08:02.534]  Of any effort to collude, conspire, or coordinate with the Russian state, this is a manifestation of the witch hunt.
[03:08:03.412 --> 03:08:08.737]  All I can do, Alex, is urge all of those people to testify honestly.
[03:08:09.117 --> 03:08:16.543]  Virtually none of them have any knowledge of my activities in the 2016 presidential campaign.
[03:08:16.983 --> 03:08:22.168]  But this is an effort, as you know, to destroy me and to bankrupt me.
[03:08:22.808 --> 03:08:26.191]  This is going to be an expensive, brutal fight.
[03:08:26.581 --> 03:08:30.123]  But I am innocent of any collusion with the Russians.
[03:08:30.523 --> 03:08:36.567]  And that, as you know, includes receiving anything from WikiLeaks and passing anything on.
[03:08:37.027 --> 03:08:37.767]  Yeah, they don't care.
[03:08:37.787 --> 03:08:40.068]  They just want to harass your crew.
[03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:43.270]  They just want to shut you down, which in a way is a rearguard action for us.
[03:08:43.791 --> 03:08:46.052]  Because the public worldwide is waking up to globalism.
[03:08:46.092 --> 03:08:47.272]  Nationalism is exploding.
[03:08:47.733 --> 03:08:49.594]  The big corrupt popes set to resign.
[03:08:50.834 --> 03:08:53.057]  This deputy caught running hundreds of kidnapped children.
[03:08:54.179 --> 03:08:55.881]  Trump's rolling up the pedophile rings.
[03:08:55.921 --> 03:08:56.862]  The country's coming back.
[03:08:57.383 --> 03:08:58.825]  I'm kind of proud we're under attack.
[03:08:58.865 --> 03:09:06.395]  It's not fun for our families or our crew, but the fact that they think getting us will stop their collapse, when I was reading this week
[03:09:07.276 --> 03:09:11.057]  CNN's ratings are down 30% in one month, Roger!
[03:09:11.077 --> 03:09:29.964]  I mean, the fact that they are whistling from the grave at us, having a picnic in the park next door, and they think, you know, getting in our business will make us back off, we're not the little sellout minions, you know, that sing to their tune.
[03:09:30.044 --> 03:09:33.985]  We, at a cold-blooded level, let's admit it, Roger, we kind of like this.
[03:09:35.031 --> 03:09:43.459]  Well, I'm definitely ready to fight, but it shows you how desperate the special counsel is to find some Russian collusion.
[03:09:43.519 --> 03:09:46.762]  He is, after a year and millions of dollars spent... Hey, I know where he can find it!
[03:09:46.802 --> 03:09:51.126]  I know where he can find it with his big old ugly ass head if he looks in a frickin' mirror!
[03:09:52.287 --> 03:09:54.949]  He'll find a big old traitor to this country right there!
[03:09:55.149 --> 03:09:57.612]  Big old sack of crap right there named Robert Mueller!
[03:09:58.786 --> 03:10:02.670]  Or he could go and knock on the door of Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:03.470 --> 03:10:10.897]  There's $145 million worth of Russian collusion there, and the money she took from the Russian energy companies... He's on tarmac!
[03:10:10.917 --> 03:10:14.540]  He's in business with the very Russian oligarch he claimed Trump was!
[03:10:15.681 --> 03:10:19.785]  It's one of the most made-up malarkey from that goon I've ever seen!
[03:10:21.175 --> 03:10:28.922]  Well, look, this is not fun to have somebody poking through your emails, your text messages, your phone calls.
[03:10:29.342 --> 03:10:38.710]  It's a massive violation of my Fourth Amendment rights and my right to privacy with no probable cause because I am guilty of no crime.
[03:10:39.751 --> 03:10:42.693]  It's an extraordinary, almost Kafkaesque experience.
[03:10:42.713 --> 03:10:46.016]  Because he's scared because he knows he's the one going to prison.
[03:10:46.416 --> 03:10:48.278]  God, I can't wait to see him in an orange jumpsuit.
[03:10:49.554 --> 03:10:51.736]  Well, from your mouth to God's ear.
[03:10:51.896 --> 03:10:55.479]  You look like a defrocked buzzard.
[03:10:55.799 --> 03:11:00.724]  A little orange jumpsuit with that big ol' ugly, you know, acromegaly head.
[03:11:01.384 --> 03:11:02.565]  Up there all pendulous.
[03:11:02.585 --> 03:11:08.050]  I bet he's gonna crap his britches whenever he's being led into that supermax prison.
[03:11:09.571 --> 03:11:13.915]  We all should pray to God that Robert Mueller is sent to a supermax prison.
[03:11:15.493 --> 03:11:18.376]  We are in an epic struggle here.
[03:11:19.117 --> 03:11:25.363]  The President needs to wake up to the fact that Mr. Mueller has the President of the United States in his sights.
[03:11:25.664 --> 03:11:29.428]  I am just collateral damage in their attempt to destroy me.
[03:11:32.791 --> 03:11:33.252]  I don't know.
[03:11:46.553 --> 03:11:47.874]  Well, but let's be very clear.
[03:11:47.894 --> 03:11:52.757]  An important part of their strategy is closing down our voice here at InfoWars.
[03:11:53.217 --> 03:11:56.920]  They want to be sure that there's no forum in which I can defend myself.
[03:11:56.960 --> 03:11:58.200]  Oh yeah, they don't want you to respond.
[03:11:58.220 --> 03:12:00.042]  Suddenly they've, you know, interviews have dried up.
[03:12:00.102 --> 03:12:00.942]  Explain that to people.
[03:12:01.282 --> 03:12:07.506]  And this big Facebook document you sent us two days ago that we finally covered, where they say by the 24th, we'll be off the air.
[03:12:07.586 --> 03:12:08.167]  Very cryptic.
[03:12:09.468 --> 03:12:11.248]  Yeah, it is extraordinary.
[03:12:11.809 --> 03:12:26.132]  Right now on Facebook, you had the ability to, when you posted a paid promotion, to reach supporters and followers of Alex Jones, InfoWars, Prison Planet, and so on.
[03:12:26.753 --> 03:12:31.654]  As of the 24th, you can no longer reach those important targets.
[03:12:32.094 --> 03:12:38.596]  This is crippling for a number of conservative Republican candidates around the country who are utilizing this service.
[03:12:38.676 --> 03:12:43.538]  It has been harmful to me in my book sales for my new book, Stone's Rules.
[03:12:44.338 --> 03:12:49.220]  How dare you try to sell a book in America, you commie!
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:52.021]  Us good liberals know how to shut your ass up!
[03:12:53.752 --> 03:13:00.236]  Well, and then this past week I was scheduled to be on Anderson Cooper's show with John Berman.
[03:13:00.896 --> 03:13:02.477]  That cancelled at the last minute.
[03:13:02.597 --> 03:13:08.341]  Then I was scheduled on Saturday to be on with Mike Smirconish to talk about my book.
[03:13:08.721 --> 03:13:10.402]  That was also cancelled.
[03:13:11.184 --> 03:13:19.646]  I guess my performance with Chris Cuomo on New Day, my performance with Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC were a little too good.
[03:13:20.027 --> 03:13:20.747]  A little too good.
[03:13:20.927 --> 03:13:21.547]  Well, let's do this.
[03:13:21.627 --> 03:13:25.688]  Your book, that is amazing, is available at MFORESTORE.COM right now.
[03:13:25.728 --> 03:13:27.429]  We'll ship it to you within a day of getting the order.
[03:13:28.049 --> 03:13:28.589]  It's available.
[03:13:28.609 --> 03:13:29.089]  It's a great book.
[03:13:29.149 --> 03:13:32.830]  You're supporting somebody under total attack that they've demonized, they've lied about.
[03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:35.571]  We've got other big specials at MFORESTORE.COM.
[03:13:35.611 --> 03:13:38.292]  And, you know, look, all I can do is stand up to Mueller.
[03:13:39.707 --> 03:13:41.728]  Kissing his evil butt isn't gonna help us.
[03:13:42.588 --> 03:13:45.930]  And Hillary and all of them, I mean, they are all complete jokes.
[03:13:46.691 --> 03:13:51.253]  And I just can't believe the cowardice in Congress, the cowardice at the Justice Department.
[03:13:51.613 --> 03:14:01.058]  But more and more there's some good people in Congress saying this is a criminal conspiracy, it's all a lie, they want contempt charges on Sessions, Mueller, all the rest of it.
[03:14:01.078 --> 03:14:04.320]  So in the end of the day, I know they're going to be destroyed.
[03:14:04.780 --> 03:14:06.601]  Now they may get us as hors d'oeuvres,
[03:14:07.361 --> 03:14:16.786]  You know like they're driving a truck over the edge of a cliff and we're kind of a bush at the bottom of the cliff but they're gonna be smashed along with us in the end or kind of like a better analogy is
[03:14:18.226 --> 03:14:29.154]  What happened in Moby Dick, you know, the old allegory, the old archetype, and you've got old Captain Ahab and his lust for war with the great white whale.
[03:14:29.174 --> 03:14:37.541]  They may jump on our back and plunge that into our old blubber, but when we take that deep dive, they're never going to be coming back up politically, my friend.
[03:14:37.581 --> 03:14:38.802]  So I think it's kind of like that.
[03:14:40.083 --> 03:14:41.484]  Well, we shall see.
[03:14:41.664 --> 03:14:57.212]  Alex, coming up, I have Frank Parlato, the publisher of Art Voice, who will speak extensively about the takedown of the NXIVM sex cult and the role I played as a source for him in the takedown of this egregious cult.
[03:14:59.997 --> 03:15:04.959]  Hey, you have seen Gregory Peck in Moby Dick, right, where he's all wound up in the tackle?
[03:15:05.839 --> 03:15:06.439]  Absolutely.
[03:15:06.699 --> 03:15:11.621]  And he's looking, that whale eye's looking at him, and he's sitting there trying to, and that whale goes, you know, I think I'm going to go underwater.
[03:15:11.661 --> 03:15:16.202]  I'm going to, you're trying to drag, you're trying to drive this big spear into me, this harpoon.
[03:15:17.302 --> 03:15:18.643]  Yeah, I'm starting to feel that close to my heart.
[03:15:18.683 --> 03:15:20.963]  How about we just go down about a thousand feet and see how you like this?
[03:15:21.464 --> 03:15:22.184]  And that's the whole thing.
[03:15:22.204 --> 03:15:26.025]  They don't, they're so arrogant, they don't get they're going to lose, my friend.
[03:15:27.423 --> 03:15:29.924]  Well, there's an epic struggle ahead.
[03:15:30.184 --> 03:15:31.804]  One that we will win.
[03:15:32.024 --> 03:15:33.905]  Of that, I have every confidence.
[03:15:34.325 --> 03:15:38.026]  But maybe in the campaign they see us like Captain Ahab, and they're the white whale.
[03:15:38.046 --> 03:15:38.446]  What do you think?
[03:15:39.706 --> 03:15:41.587]  No, I think they're the white whale, actually.
[03:15:41.607 --> 03:15:45.428]  I don't know, man.
[03:15:45.468 --> 03:15:47.308]  The white whale's cooler than Captain Ahab.
[03:15:47.908 --> 03:15:50.769]  We're not gonna let Mueller be Captain Ahab, are we here?
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:52.960]  Are we letting him be Moby Dick?
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:54.641]  You're probably right.
[03:15:55.161 --> 03:15:55.721]  We'll see.
[03:15:55.761 --> 03:15:57.461]  It's a point of contention now.
[03:15:57.781 --> 03:15:58.342]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:58.362 --> 03:15:58.762]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.943 --> 03:16:17.186]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[03:16:19.702 --> 03:16:25.804]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[03:16:27.224 --> 03:16:29.745]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[03:16:30.545 --> 03:16:33.966]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[03:16:34.906 --> 03:16:37.067]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[03:16:38.787 --> 03:16:43.929]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[03:16:45.888 --> 03:16:52.513]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[03:16:53.474 --> 03:16:54.474]  It's up to us personally.
[03:16:55.876 --> 03:17:02.721]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[03:17:03.221 --> 03:17:04.522]  I expected that to happen.
[03:17:05.703 --> 03:17:07.044]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:17:09.031 --> 03:17:19.958]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[03:17:20.659 --> 03:17:22.200]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[03:17:22.900 --> 03:17:34.528]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[03:17:35.108 --> 03:17:37.290]  And we've already come so far together
[03:17:38.308 --> 03:17:47.334]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[03:17:47.914 --> 03:17:53.318]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[03:17:54.439 --> 03:18:02.344]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[03:18:04.557 --> 03:18:09.301]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[03:18:10.823 --> 03:18:12.824]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[03:18:13.285 --> 03:18:14.806]  That's a conservative estimate.
[03:18:15.807 --> 03:18:18.450]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[03:18:19.250 --> 03:18:21.072]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[03:18:21.112 --> 03:18:26.016]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[03:18:27.097 --> 03:18:37.890]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[03:18:37.930 --> 03:18:41.895]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[03:18:43.303 --> 03:18:43.963]  Our game changing.
[03:18:44.383 --> 03:18:45.884]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[03:18:46.084 --> 03:18:47.244]  The other equation of probiotic.
[03:18:47.284 --> 03:18:50.844]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[03:18:51.165 --> 03:18:52.265]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[03:18:52.365 --> 03:18:56.706]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[03:18:57.266 --> 03:19:00.506]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[03:19:00.526 --> 03:19:01.606]  It just does incredible things.
[03:19:02.047 --> 03:19:03.507]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[03:19:03.527 --> 03:19:06.487]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[03:19:06.507 --> 03:19:09.048]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:19:09.588 --> 03:19:09.728]  That's
[03:19:27.856 --> 03:19:33.500]  Nanosilver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[03:19:33.540 --> 03:19:34.821]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[03:19:35.041 --> 03:19:36.222]  You can swallow it as well.
[03:19:36.622 --> 03:19:42.906]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:43.226 --> 03:19:44.607]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:19:44.627 --> 03:19:54.234]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:19:54.534 --> 03:19:57.596]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:20:06.646 --> 03:20:09.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:16.508 --> 03:20:25.057]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.458 --> 03:20:30.223]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:30.603 --> 03:20:31.304]  Welcome back.
[03:20:32.325 --> 03:20:36.850]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:38.494 --> 03:20:43.958]  I have noticed on QAnon an enormous amount of disinformation.
[03:20:44.399 --> 03:20:45.920]  We have Moby Dick going on here.
[03:20:45.940 --> 03:20:46.760]  This is terrific.
[03:20:47.661 --> 03:21:07.656]  We got to figure out who's who in this epic struggle between Robert Mueller and the forces of freedom, between those who would undo the results of the last election and those who believe in a constitutional government and the legitimacy of the Trump presidency.
[03:21:09.081 --> 03:21:24.592]  In any event, I have noticed on QAnon recently an enormous amount of disinformation regarding the recently exposed sex cult NXIVM.
[03:21:25.601 --> 03:21:31.546]  And a huge amount of disinformation regarding my relationship with them.
[03:21:32.367 --> 03:21:37.051]  I served as a consultant lobbyist for them for two months.
[03:21:37.772 --> 03:21:50.624]  But to clarify that situation, joining me now is the crusading journalist who busted the NXIVM sex cult wide open, leading to the arrest
[03:21:51.264 --> 03:21:58.210]  Of these pedophiles, Frank Parlato, the publisher of Art Voice, joins us now by phone.
[03:21:58.551 --> 03:22:01.493]  Frank's welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:03.255 --> 03:22:03.955]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:22:03.975 --> 03:22:05.157]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[03:22:07.158 --> 03:22:17.928]  So would you clarify, since you were there and worked briefly as a public relations man for the for the NXIVM self-help program,
[03:22:18.484 --> 03:22:25.190]  Well, I was the publisher, the publicist rather, at the time that you were involved.
[03:22:25.210 --> 03:22:32.576]  In fact, you were just getting out of your lobbyist relationship with NXIVM as I was getting in.
[03:22:47.700 --> 03:23:08.828]  And I recall clearly at the time that you had quit this group that you were never a member of but merely a consultant because you thought that there was some untoward and possibly inappropriate behaviors on the part of the cult leader Keith Raniere.
[03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:13.830]  So I'm here to say unequivocally that you were never a member
[03:23:14.482 --> 03:23:17.024]  Well, and I urged you, as you know, I urged you to get out.
[03:23:17.064 --> 03:23:17.445]  Now, I stress,
[03:23:34.952 --> 03:23:48.375]  That in my brief association with this group, I never saw any evidence that they were a sex cult or that they were abusing women or girls.
[03:23:48.935 --> 03:23:51.956]  What I did sense was financial impropriety.
[03:23:52.036 --> 03:24:01.418]  They appeared to be latching on to wealthy, young women, in many cases trust fund babies,
[03:24:02.018 --> 03:24:02.319]  I don't
[03:24:17.792 --> 03:24:18.933]  Of the organization.
[03:24:34.188 --> 03:24:40.314]  I also am proud to say that I was a source for you in your epic takedown of the cult.
[03:24:40.894 --> 03:24:51.364]  And I think it's important that people not be allowed to go online and smear me as being part and parcel of something that I had no part of and never witnessed.
[03:24:52.025 --> 03:24:57.010]  As you explained it to me, the sexual abuse comes much later.
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:19.114]  That's absolutely correct, Roger, and I think it's very important to put on the record for anyone that's interested in knowing the actual truth relative to this cult that you not only were not a member of the cult, but you had a positive, definite role in taking this cult down.
[03:25:21.436 --> 03:25:22.797]  Well, I'm delighted to have that.
[03:25:24.193 --> 03:25:33.981]  I'm delighted to have that on the record because many people who are detractors of either mine or InfoWars have tried to allege otherwise.
[03:25:34.581 --> 03:25:39.345]  I urge people who want the actual detail to go to this terrific article on The Art Voice.
[03:25:39.825 --> 03:25:45.790]  Roger Stone had a role in taking the NXIVM cult down and I was never a member of this cult.
[03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:47.411]  I'm tired of the smears.
[03:25:47.891 --> 03:25:49.833]  I'm tired of the innuendo.
[03:25:50.754 --> 03:25:52.675]  I was first in and first out.
[03:25:53.356 --> 03:25:55.458]  I became exceedingly uncomfortable.
[03:25:56.519 --> 03:26:11.634]  But all I really saw was a substantial group of well-heeled, middle-aged women taking this self-esteem course, which I refused to take, but audited one afternoon, much to the consternation
[03:26:12.434 --> 03:26:13.835]  Of the cult leaders.
[03:26:14.315 --> 03:26:21.460]  I also was around when they lost millions of dollars in a commodities trade.
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:38.671]  I think it was corn futures of their of their some of their financial supporters money, which they then insisted was not the result of a bad investment by Keith Raniere, but the result of some kind of skullduggery
[03:26:39.131 --> 03:26:39.852]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[03:26:39.872 --> 03:26:41.372]  And I think the record should appropriately show
[03:27:08.496 --> 03:27:15.001]  That you were the first guy to say, this is a crooked cult.
[03:27:15.521 --> 03:27:21.166]  And you were the first guy, certainly for me, who told me that Ranieri was a charlatan.
[03:27:21.846 --> 03:27:28.691]  And the record shows also that I'm the one that broke the stories that ultimately led to the arrest.
[03:27:29.272 --> 03:27:34.456]  So I think you deserve a great deal of credit for busting up this human trafficking cult.
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:42.770]  You know, despite the fact that it wasn't human trafficking, as far as we know, back when you were there, it evolved into that.
[03:27:43.251 --> 03:27:52.143]  And I think if more people had heeded your voice at the time, maybe some of this human trafficking might have been prevented.
[03:27:53.473 --> 03:27:53.773]  All right.
[03:27:53.893 --> 03:27:55.574]  Thank you very much, Frank Perlotto.
[03:27:55.614 --> 03:27:58.275]  Thanks for calling in and helping us clarify that.
[03:27:59.055 --> 03:28:04.438]  I feel much better now because I'm tired of the disinformation that exists out there.
[03:28:04.958 --> 03:28:05.958]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:28:06.178 --> 03:28:08.419]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:08.980 --> 03:28:14.442]  I do want to remind you that we are brought to you only through the generosity of our listeners and our viewers.
[03:28:14.992 --> 03:28:18.473]  In your loyal patronage at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:28:18.913 --> 03:28:30.075]  You can go there now and buy, among other things, my new book, Stones Rules, which is my guide on how to win at politics, business, and style.
[03:28:30.515 --> 03:28:36.256]  And while you're at it, you might want to consider sending a generous contribution to InfoWars.
[03:28:36.316 --> 03:28:42.377]  We are fighting a war against censorship that is very expensive, beating back these baseless
[03:28:42.817 --> 03:28:48.009]  Frivolous lawsuits that are designed for big, splashy, negative headlines.
[03:28:48.390 --> 03:28:49.652]  We need your help.
[03:28:50.053 --> 03:28:52.399]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[03:29:02.119 --> 03:29:03.500]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:03.780 --> 03:29:05.080]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:06.161]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:06.461 --> 03:29:12.223]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:12.443 --> 03:29:18.165]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:18.365 --> 03:29:35.249]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:35.609 --> 03:29:37.750]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:39.291]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:39.571 --> 03:29:40.271]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:40.611 --> 03:29:41.231]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:41.532 --> 03:29:43.352]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:06.442]  I've tried to become an expert on geopolitical systems, cultural systems, and how things work.
[03:30:07.422 --> 03:30:15.105]  And I've found that you've got a bunch of occultists that want to control humanity and basically act like gods who want to dumb people down.
[03:30:15.465 --> 03:30:16.546]  Well, I want the opposite.
[03:30:17.146 --> 03:30:18.527]  I want to empower people.
[03:30:18.707 --> 03:30:22.208]  I want to see people living out their own destiny, having free will.
[03:30:22.668 --> 03:30:24.389]  But to do that, we've got to be supportive.
[03:30:24.649 --> 03:30:31.372]  The reason the globalist hate InfoWars is not because I'm that good, even though my heart's in the right place.
[03:30:33.132 --> 03:30:40.196]  It's because we have guests on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of them a month that are smart.
[03:30:40.557 --> 03:30:42.438]  And they don't want real talks.
[03:30:42.538 --> 03:30:44.039]  They don't want real discussions.
[03:30:44.059 --> 03:30:44.859]  Remember last year?
[03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:46.861]  Last December we got the Google documents.
[03:30:47.261 --> 03:30:50.843]  They were spending millions of dollars to delist InfoWars and Ron Paul.
[03:30:51.143 --> 03:30:52.324]  Except look at the fake news.
[03:30:52.364 --> 03:30:56.527]  They claim the UN and others said no chemical attack happened and it was staged by the rebels.
[03:30:57.447 --> 03:30:58.288]  We want them banned.
[03:30:59.212 --> 03:31:00.674]  Google said, that's a real document.
[03:31:00.754 --> 03:31:02.276]  We're sorry, we're not going to do it now.
[03:31:02.757 --> 03:31:03.939]  They went ahead with the delisting.
[03:31:04.920 --> 03:31:09.467]  So, that's an example, ladies and gentlemen, of how they're at war with memory.
[03:31:10.188 --> 03:31:14.814]  So if you want to support us, just like, informationally, we're game-changing.
[03:31:15.939 --> 03:31:19.841]  Supplements, t-shirts, books, films, water filters, air filters, storable foods.
[03:31:20.521 --> 03:31:24.223]  Whatever we promote and sell, I go and check out and make sure it's really high quality.
[03:31:24.743 --> 03:31:34.448]  Infowarsstore.com, we have the fluoride-free and 4 to 5 with a little silver and iodine adult and children's toothpaste made by the top organic manufacturer in the country.
[03:31:35.268 --> 03:31:42.070]  Discounted, we have the Immune Gargle in three sizes, we have the mouthwash, and we also have Boggies, 95% curcuminin level.
[03:31:42.510 --> 03:31:47.851]  Curcuminin is the chemical that is in turmeric, the anti-inflammatory, and so much more.
[03:31:48.231 --> 03:31:49.072]  It's 50% off.
[03:31:49.112 --> 03:31:50.892]  Check those out, infowarestore.com.
[03:31:51.432 --> 03:31:55.813]  And when you purchase the products, you stand against the globalists and their censorship.
[03:31:55.833 --> 03:32:01.175]  When you use your free will to get products you need and fund us, they're apoplectic.
[03:32:01.255 --> 03:32:02.135]  They don't know what to do.
[03:32:06.607 --> 03:32:12.839]  If you sign up for our free newsletter that goes out daily at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[03:32:13.840 --> 03:32:24.848]  We will send you breaking videos, breaking articles, key analysis, and links to all of our podcasts, all of our live feeds, all of our live streams at the bottom.
[03:32:25.028 --> 03:32:26.129]  There's a bunch of them.
[03:32:26.209 --> 03:32:30.732]  And we've got backups, so that we have that personal, direct relationship with you.
[03:32:31.393 --> 03:32:38.078]  I was never good about email and collecting folks' email like everybody else does, because I was always going for the latest, cutting-edge stuff.
[03:32:38.138 --> 03:32:38.738]  We still do that.
[03:32:39.138 --> 03:32:40.800]  But all the experts have told me, Alex,
[03:32:41.440 --> 03:32:43.141]  If they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[03:32:43.702 --> 03:32:52.629]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[03:32:53.270 --> 03:32:57.893]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[03:32:58.574 --> 03:33:01.036]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[03:33:06.260 --> 03:33:08.882]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.955 --> 03:33:21.824]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:33:21.844 --> 03:33:24.650]  You're listening to Roger Stone on N4.
[03:33:32.353 --> 03:33:33.854]  Hi, I'm Michael Williams.
[03:33:34.215 --> 03:33:35.996]  And boy, do we have some exciting news to you.
[03:33:36.437 --> 03:33:38.758]  We have our bus tour ready to go.
[03:33:38.858 --> 03:33:41.721]  But it's not going to be one of those pansy political bus tours.
[03:33:42.201 --> 03:33:44.623]  We've got the deportation bus.
[03:33:44.963 --> 03:33:45.504]  That's right.
[03:33:45.544 --> 03:33:46.124]  You heard me.
[03:33:46.465 --> 03:33:49.267]  The Michael Williams deportation bus.
[03:33:49.587 --> 03:33:50.908]  You want to find out where we're coming?
[03:33:51.328 --> 03:33:54.351]  Go to deportationbus.com.
[03:33:54.531 --> 03:34:01.537]  We're going to implement my 287G deportation plan that's going to fill this bus with illegals to send them back to where they came from.
[03:34:02.037 --> 03:34:04.819]  We're not just going to track them and watch them roam around our state.
[03:34:04.839 --> 03:34:06.960]  We're going to put them on this bus and send them home.
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:10.081]  Go to deportationbus.com and find out where we're going to be.
[03:34:10.101 --> 03:34:11.182]  See you there.
[03:34:14.853 --> 03:34:35.218]  Senator Michael Williams of Georgia, whose campaign for governor is surging because of the strong stand he has taken against sanctuary cities, and is currently on his deportation bus tour, joins us now by phone, besieged, I am told, by demonstrators.
[03:34:35.598 --> 03:34:38.219]  Senator Williams, welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:34:39.344 --> 03:34:40.565]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[03:34:40.765 --> 03:34:41.245]  I see.
[03:34:41.305 --> 03:34:41.546]  Roger.
[03:34:41.566 --> 03:34:41.846]  I'm sorry.
[03:34:41.866 --> 03:34:43.987]  Thanks for allowing me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:44.368 --> 03:34:46.429]  It's a pleasure to be here and you're absolutely correct.
[03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:49.171]  We are on our second stop in Decatur.
[03:34:49.211 --> 03:34:52.914]  It's one of the sanctuary cities that we wanted to highlight in Georgia.
[03:34:52.954 --> 03:34:57.437]  Let people know that we do have sanctuary cities in Georgia and the protesters that are here
[03:34:58.401 --> 03:35:03.842]  They are basically throwing their bodies in front of our vehicles, not allowing us to move.
[03:35:03.902 --> 03:35:08.403]  The police are here trying to make, I guess, to make way for us.
[03:35:08.503 --> 03:35:11.924]  But yeah, they've made a big issue about this.
[03:35:12.104 --> 03:35:15.925]  And we also believe that many of them are a part of Antifa.
[03:35:15.945 --> 03:35:18.666]  We've had some death threats come from them.
[03:35:18.746 --> 03:35:22.506]  I know that they posted all the places that we're going to be on this trip.
[03:35:22.566 --> 03:35:25.187]  So it's pretty exciting right now.
[03:35:26.368 --> 03:35:30.170]  Well, I give you enormous credit for taking a strong stand.
[03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:37.373]  How do you feel your campaign is going versus Lieutenant Governor Country Club Cagle?
[03:35:38.694 --> 03:35:41.635]  We are incredibly excited about our campaign.
[03:35:42.075 --> 03:35:54.101]  One of the things that people that have been following our campaign know is that we are a fearless conservative, not just because of what we're doing with the deportation bus tour, but there's been several other things that we have done.
[03:35:54.762 --> 03:35:59.787]  We protested a teacher that kicked out two of her students for wearing a Make It Great Again shirt.
[03:36:00.027 --> 03:36:10.477]  We're out there taking a stand for those people that love our country, love our Constitution, and are tired of seeing it desecrated and invaded by illegals.
[03:36:11.538 --> 03:36:19.265]  Well, I also know that you have been in the forefront of standing up for the National Rifle Association there in the state of Georgia.
[03:36:20.154 --> 03:36:21.214]  No, exactly, exactly.
[03:36:21.254 --> 03:36:27.257]  Whenever Nancy Pelosi was out there trying to ban bump stocks, we said, no, no, no, Nancy, you're not going to ban bump stocks.
[03:36:27.297 --> 03:36:30.058]  In fact, we are going to give away a bump stock.
[03:36:30.098 --> 03:36:33.139]  We raffled off a bump stock to one of our supporters.
[03:36:33.639 --> 03:36:40.322]  And again, just in defiance, I've been out there talking about protecting and defending our Second Amendment rights for constitutional carry.
[03:36:40.542 --> 03:36:46.444]  We need that here in Georgia, because there is a big push by the left, by the progressives that are trying to take away our guns.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:53.341]  And we need elected officials that are actually going to stand up and fight against those that want to dearm us.
[03:36:54.722 --> 03:37:08.444]  Well, in the interest of full disclosure, let me say that while I have traveled to Georgia and personally endorsed Mike Williams' campaign for governor, I have no professional relationship with his campaign.
[03:37:08.624 --> 03:37:11.165]  I am just proud to be a supporter.
[03:37:11.605 --> 03:37:22.613]  Mike Williams was one of Donald Trump's original supporters in the state of Georgia, when in the Peach State Country Club, Cagle was supporting Jeb Bush.
[03:37:23.054 --> 03:37:24.975]  The battle lines are drawn.
[03:37:25.095 --> 03:37:34.342]  Mike Williams is a solid, liberty committed, conservative, and a strong supporter of the President, and he is running against the
[03:37:34.782 --> 03:37:43.471]  Lily-livered, country club, moderate Republicans as represented by country club Cagle, the Lieutenant Governor.
[03:37:43.871 --> 03:37:48.676]  Senator Williams, thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:37:49.096 --> 03:37:58.406]  When is the primary and how do people contact your campaign to make a contribution or to volunteer?
[03:37:59.574 --> 03:38:01.936]  Yeah, well, early voting is going on right now.
[03:38:02.016 --> 03:38:07.580]  It goes on from now until Friday, and then the election day is May 22nd, so next Tuesday.
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:08.461]  It's six days away.
[03:38:08.961 --> 03:38:18.628]  And anybody that feels like they want a fearless conservative that's willing to stand with President Trump on a lot of the tough issues out there, visit our campaign page.
[03:38:18.668 --> 03:38:19.669]  It's Williams, Georgia.
[03:38:20.149 --> 03:38:22.110]  All spelled out, williamsgeorgia.com.
[03:38:22.491 --> 03:38:25.012]  You can sign up to volunteer, you can sign up to donate.
[03:38:25.372 --> 03:38:28.394]  Again, like you said, we are up against the powerful establishment.
[03:38:28.414 --> 03:38:38.920]  There's four other candidates that are all being funded by the same special interests, the lobbyists, the super country club elite types that are out there trying to take this election from us.
[03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:40.862]  So we need all your help.
[03:38:40.982 --> 03:38:44.664]  So share with your friends and let's get out there and vote and win this thing for President Trump.
[03:38:45.649 --> 03:38:45.909]  Great.
[03:38:46.049 --> 03:38:48.311]  Thank you very much, Senator Michael Williams.
[03:38:48.491 --> 03:38:54.916]  Again, that Republican primary, May 22nd, but early voting going on now.
[03:38:55.396 --> 03:39:10.226]  A crusading, dependable conservative, a man with brass cojones who is leading the fight for deportation of illegals and shutting down the sanctuary cities in his home state of Georgia.
[03:39:10.687 --> 03:39:12.448]  I thank you for joining us.
[03:39:13.286 --> 03:39:25.115]  Folks, we're able to bring you this kind of on-the-scene, cutting-edge news only because of your loyal support for InfoWars at the InfoWars store.
[03:39:25.735 --> 03:39:30.719]  We face the greatest challenges in our history here at InfoWars.
[03:39:31.199 --> 03:39:50.507]  A string of frivolous harassment lawsuits designed to generate big, splashy headlines that are then used to smear Alex Jones, to smear InfoWars, to smear David Knight and smear Owen Schroeder and the entire line of reporters here.
[03:39:51.487 --> 03:39:52.848]  This is an insidious
[03:39:53.708 --> 03:40:05.876]  Organized campaign by the tech left to take those headlines and then utilize them as the rationale to take us off of YouTube to limit our reach at Facebook.
[03:40:06.416 --> 03:40:16.322]  We learned only this week through the Mike Williams campaign, in fact, that as of the 24th, you could no longer target
[03:40:17.115 --> 03:40:21.416]  For Reach, supporters of Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[03:40:21.896 --> 03:40:29.538]  This is meant to cripple us and cripple the dependable conservatives who want to reach the InfoWars audience.
[03:40:29.959 --> 03:40:36.600]  So please now, folks, go to the InfoWars store and look at some of our terrific nutraceuticals.
[03:40:38.261 --> 03:40:42.422]  The bodies, which is the very best tumeric formula
[03:40:42.902 --> 03:40:43.783]  Thank you so much.
[03:40:59.085 --> 03:41:05.251]  My all-time favorite, which goes without saying, Brain Force Plus.
[03:41:05.732 --> 03:41:12.699]  Brain Force Plus, it might as well be the sponsor of this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:41:13.139 --> 03:41:22.149]  After spending many hours fighting Robert Mueller and the special counsel, probably Robert Mueller and the special counsel,
[03:41:22.569 --> 03:41:29.073]  And the fake news media who in the next 24 hours will mount an enormous smear on me.
[03:41:29.513 --> 03:41:34.796]  None of this would be possible without the benefits of Brain Force Plus.
[03:41:35.336 --> 03:41:47.943]  Pop two of these babies and you get almost immediate mental energy and clarity and a whole new wave of mental energy to take on the globalists and the hard left.
[03:41:48.583 --> 03:41:55.245]  Now on special at $29.95, that's $10 off this terrific product.
[03:41:55.645 --> 03:42:04.828]  You will thank me, you will thank InfoWars, and at the same time you will be boosting the fight for freedom and the fight for the First Amendment.
[03:42:05.408 --> 03:42:09.510]  We here have faced a struggle as we have never faced.
[03:42:10.050 --> 03:42:12.932]  They are kneecapping us on Facebook.
[03:42:13.312 --> 03:42:15.833]  They are kneecapping us on YouTube.
[03:42:16.273 --> 03:42:20.315]  They are seeking to wipe us off the face of the Internet.
[03:42:21.035 --> 03:42:21.776]  Entirely.
[03:42:22.156 --> 03:42:24.197]  We cannot let this happen.
[03:42:24.357 --> 03:42:26.039]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:42:26.419 --> 03:42:28.020]  You are the resistance.
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:31.682]  We need your support as never before.
[03:42:32.142 --> 03:42:44.811]  I know I speak for Alex Jones and everyone here at InfoWars when I tell you how much we appreciate your loyal support and your patronage for the products at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:42:45.351 --> 03:42:48.173]  I'm Roger Stone and I will be right back.
[03:43:02.423 --> 03:43:08.427]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:43:08.787 --> 03:43:11.409]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:43:12.009 --> 03:43:15.451]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:43:15.711 --> 03:43:19.994]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:43:20.414 --> 03:43:23.677]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:43:24.577 --> 03:43:34.824]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:43:35.565 --> 03:43:44.091]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:43:45.732 --> 03:43:54.285]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[03:43:54.805 --> 03:43:59.092]  Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[03:44:02.794 --> 03:44:04.856]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:44:05.096 --> 03:44:06.437]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:44:06.657 --> 03:44:10.200]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:18.306]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:44:18.507 --> 03:44:23.330]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:44:23.491 --> 03:44:28.935]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:44:29.275 --> 03:44:36.824]  Secret 12 by Infowars Live is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:44:37.064 --> 03:44:41.509]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:44:41.789 --> 03:44:50.599]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:44:50.799 --> 03:44:54.086]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[03:44:54.347 --> 03:44:58.035]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:58.255 --> 03:45:00.219]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:03.777 --> 03:45:08.218]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:08.438 --> 03:45:13.139]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:13.739 --> 03:45:19.600]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:32.603]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:33.363 --> 03:45:42.069]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:45:42.090 --> 03:45:43.971]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:44.291 --> 03:45:45.412]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:45.432 --> 03:45:46.673]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:46.693 --> 03:45:48.094]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:48.294 --> 03:45:49.774]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:50.295 --> 03:45:51.895]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:51.915 --> 03:45:53.696]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:54.056 --> 03:45:56.657]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:56.697 --> 03:45:57.557]  This is insane.
[03:45:57.957 --> 03:45:59.578]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:45:59.838 --> 03:46:02.398]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:02.839 --> 03:46:04.359]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:04.399 --> 03:46:06.220]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:08.100]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:08.961 --> 03:46:14.882]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:15.142 --> 03:46:16.483]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:18.012 --> 03:46:26.000]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:26.020 --> 03:46:28.423]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:28.443 --> 03:46:29.604]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:33.653 --> 03:46:36.515]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:36.875 --> 03:46:39.477]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:39.497 --> 03:46:44.261]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:44.721 --> 03:46:50.865]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:50.885 --> 03:46:53.988]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:54.348 --> 03:46:55.649]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:06.221 --> 03:47:08.922]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.569 --> 03:47:24.109]  News.
[03:47:24.629 --> 03:47:25.450]  Analysis.
[03:47:25.970 --> 03:47:26.650]  Reports.
[03:47:27.370 --> 03:47:29.551]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.072 --> 03:47:32.993]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:35.854 --> 03:47:38.605]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.625 --> 03:47:40.774]  I'm your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:41.491 --> 03:47:55.834]  Well, sure as rain, Reuters just minutes ago broke a story regarding a social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, who worked for me for two months during the 2016 campaign.
[03:47:56.394 --> 03:48:08.876]  Mr. Sullivan received a subpoena from Robert Mueller, the special counsel, for both documents and for potentially an appearance before the grand jury.
[03:48:09.617 --> 03:48:11.638]  I find this very curious.
[03:48:12.458 --> 03:48:22.982]  I terminated my relationship with Mr. Sullivan, who's a Nice Enough fellow, after his social media program did not achieve the results we had hoped for.
[03:48:23.583 --> 03:48:32.086]  It is notable, however, that in his role as a vendor, he had complete and total access to my Twitter feed.
[03:48:32.799 --> 03:48:42.205]  Anything that is of interest in my Twitter feed, and particularly the Twitter direct messages, was turned over to the House Intelligence Committee months ago.
[03:48:42.725 --> 03:48:46.587]  Those looking for a smoking gun will not find one.
[03:48:47.108 --> 03:48:49.009]  As I have said numerous times,
[03:48:49.489 --> 03:49:01.854]  I had no advanced knowledge of the content, source, or the exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:02.314 --> 03:49:06.876]  This entire charade is meant to distract us from the fact
[03:49:07.316 --> 03:49:29.504]  That the deep state, the Obama Justice Department, the Obama FBI was involved in the fabrication of phony dossiers which were then used as the rationale for the wholesale unconstitutional surveillance of the campaign of the Republican candidate for president.
[03:49:30.024 --> 03:49:50.297]  We all also now know definitively, based on the testimony of Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS and of Mr. Steele, that the FBI infiltrated and had a mole inside of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:49:50.978 --> 03:49:57.422]  How do we justify having one of our major law enforcement organizations
[03:49:58.131 --> 03:50:01.480]  Spying on the Republican candidate for president.
[03:50:02.102 --> 03:50:04.127]  I can only assume that in their
[03:50:05.541 --> 03:50:12.003]  Subpoena for Mr. Sullivan, they are seeking some evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:50:12.603 --> 03:50:21.145]  As I indicated earlier on the show, others among my associates have been contacted by the special counsel's office.
[03:50:21.805 --> 03:50:27.527]  All I can do is urge all of them to testify completely and truthfully.
[03:50:27.927 --> 03:50:31.288]  There is no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:50:31.308 --> 03:50:33.872]  I received nothing from WikiLeaks.
[03:50:41.016 --> 03:50:43.358]  Or anyone else, including the Russians.
[03:50:43.438 --> 03:50:52.505]  Therefore, I passed nothing, including allegedly hacked emails, to Donald Trump or the Trump campaign.
[03:50:53.065 --> 03:50:56.128]  This is a left-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:50:56.528 --> 03:51:05.075]  A left-wing conspiracy theory that is the basis for two totally frivolous lawsuits against me.
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:12.525]  One of those two lawsuits will actually have a hearing tomorrow at 1.30 at the U.S.
[03:51:12.605 --> 03:51:20.731]  District Courthouse in Washington, D.C., where my lawyers will move for dismissal of this phony lawsuit.
[03:51:21.612 --> 03:51:29.598]  The purpose of this lawsuit is to claim that after WikiLeaks published the material that was allegedly hacked
[03:51:29.983 --> 03:51:35.365]  from the DNC that I reported on it here at InfoWars and elsewhere.
[03:51:35.745 --> 03:51:44.149]  And therefore I have violated the privacy rights of those who were identified in the completely accurate material.
[03:51:44.509 --> 03:51:50.812]  So I'm not being accused of hate speech or fake speech.
[03:51:51.412 --> 03:51:58.915]  I'm being accused of speech, of engaging in my First Amendment rights based on the facts.
[03:51:59.395 --> 03:52:26.276]  This is the kind of harassment lawsuit that you also see here at InfoWars, where Alex Jones is being sued repeatedly by the globalists and others who seek to use these lawsuits as a club to silence us, to embarrass us, to silence us through negative television and newspaper stories, and then use those stories
[03:52:26.997 --> 03:52:31.453]  As the rationale to remove us entirely from the internet.
[03:52:33.228 --> 03:52:35.189]  Don't let that happen, folks.
[03:52:35.629 --> 03:52:38.291]  That is exactly what they have in mind.
[03:52:39.111 --> 03:52:48.036]  I urge members of the mainstream press to cover this hearing at 1.30 tomorrow in Room 32A of the U.S.
[03:52:48.116 --> 03:52:54.999]  District Court Building in D.C., where my attorneys will make the case for dismissal.
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:52:57.601]  This is what we call lawfare.
[03:52:57.761 --> 03:53:01.443]  It is an outrageous abuse of our legal system.
[03:53:02.383 --> 03:53:30.938]  This is almost as egregious as the Democratic National Committee lawsuit, where Donald Trump, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr., Julian Assange, Infowars, pardon me, Wikileaks, and others are being sued again in a frivolous lawsuit that claims that we worked with the Russian state to hack the DNC and then forward that information from Infowars.
[03:53:31.713 --> 03:53:36.922]  As unprovable in a court of law as it is in the court of public opinion.
[03:53:37.643 --> 03:53:40.824]  It is a left-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:53:41.285 --> 03:53:45.906]  It is a crackpot version of what they think may have happened.
[03:53:46.327 --> 03:53:57.531]  It's extraordinary that in this lawsuit, they have no evidence or proof, hoping that they will find evidence somewhere if they survive summary judgment in discovery.
[03:53:57.991 --> 03:54:01.773]  That is an outrageous abuse of our legal system.
[03:54:02.333 --> 03:54:07.897]  But I must tell you, the cost of this for myself and my family is extraordinary.
[03:54:08.477 --> 03:54:15.122]  I have lost clients over this and we face ultimately a monumental cost.
[03:54:15.562 --> 03:54:20.005]  So I ask you to visit the stonedefensefund.com
[03:54:20.425 --> 03:54:35.451]  StoneDefenseFund.com and consider a contribution there, as well as going to the InfoWars site and making a contribution at InfoWars for their epic financial fight that is entailed.
[03:54:35.491 --> 03:54:36.132]  There you have it.
[03:54:36.572 --> 03:54:39.473]  The StoneLegalDefenseFund.com.
[03:54:39.913 --> 03:54:41.414]  My children will thank you.
[03:54:41.554 --> 03:54:43.274]  My grandchildren will thank you.
[03:54:43.675 --> 03:54:44.775]  My wife will thank you.
[03:54:44.855 --> 03:54:46.736]  Even my dogs will thank you.
[03:54:47.316 --> 03:54:54.185]  We face bankruptcy thanks to these deep-pocketed leftists who seek to destroy us.
[03:54:54.325 --> 03:55:04.017]  Now, I have to not only fight these lawsuits, I have to fight an inquisition by the special counsel who wants to make 2 and 2 add up to 6.
[03:55:05.205 --> 03:55:09.589]  I have no involvement in Russian collusion for the final time.
[03:55:09.989 --> 03:55:13.333]  And this, as the president says, is a witch hunt.
[03:55:13.833 --> 03:55:22.681]  Now you can do me a special favor by going to the InfoWars.com store and getting your copy of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[03:55:23.342 --> 03:55:25.884]  This can be shipped to you literally overnight.
[03:55:25.984 --> 03:55:29.848]  It's the fastest place to get it at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:55:30.328 --> 03:55:33.311]  This is my rules for the road.
[03:55:33.391 --> 03:55:35.193]  This is my operating manual.
[03:55:35.714 --> 03:55:39.458]  Everything I have learned in 40 years in American politics.
[03:55:39.798 --> 03:55:41.580]  But it's not just about politics.
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:49.729]  It's about advertising, marketing, public relations, food, automobiles, movies, and above all, style.
[03:55:50.470 --> 03:55:54.894]  If you're going to fight the globalists, you might as well be well-dressed while you are doing it.
[03:55:55.335 --> 03:56:00.881]  You can, again, get my terrific book, Stone's Rules, at the Infowars.com store.
[03:56:00.941 --> 03:56:02.523]  It's the fastest place to get it.
[03:56:02.823 --> 03:56:05.426]  We can literally get it to you virtually overnight.
[03:56:05.887 --> 03:56:08.390]  Please order your copy today.
[03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:10.312]  And while you're on the site,
[03:56:10.712 --> 03:56:13.213]  Consider a contribution to InfoWars.
[03:56:13.694 --> 03:56:31.903]  We face a struggle as never before, and for the first time, we're asking people to consider, if you're not in the mood for one of our great nutraceuticals, or one of our t-shirts, or my book, but you want to help the fight for freedom, you can go to the InfoWars.com store.
[03:56:31.963 --> 03:56:33.884]  There's a button for a contribution.
[03:56:34.565 --> 03:56:37.086]  $25, $50, $100.
[03:56:34.785 --> 03:56:37.086]  Yes, some info warriors have given as much as $500 or $1,000.
[03:56:37.146 --> 03:56:39.648]  God will bless you for your bountiful contribution.
[03:56:39.768 --> 03:56:42.249]  And Alex Jones and the crew at InfoWars will put it
[03:56:51.554 --> 03:56:52.955]  To good use.
[03:56:53.535 --> 03:56:54.555]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:56:54.735 --> 03:56:58.497]  I thank you for joining me here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:58.577 --> 03:57:03.139]  This is a time of enormous crisis and enormous opportunity.
[03:57:03.539 --> 03:57:05.139]  Make no mistake about it.
[03:57:05.279 --> 03:57:11.262]  The deep state has every intention of trying to undo the results of the last election.
[03:57:11.622 --> 03:57:16.104]  The ultimate target is not Roger Stone or Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[03:57:16.484 --> 03:57:19.325]  The ultimate target is Donald J. Trump.
[03:57:20.125 --> 03:57:28.388]  An American with a reform agenda that scares the crap out of the globalists and those who want one world government.
[03:57:28.709 --> 03:57:31.530]  Thank you so much for joining me here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:34.671]  God bless you and we will see you at the War Room.
[03:57:57.856 --> 03:58:06.622]  Infowars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[03:58:07.042 --> 03:58:14.408]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:14.728 --> 03:58:17.470]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:58:26.007 --> 03:58:27.848]  Desiree, thanks for holding your on the air from California.
[03:58:27.868 --> 03:58:28.168]  Go ahead.
[03:58:28.288 --> 03:58:32.190]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[03:58:32.310 --> 03:58:37.332]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[03:58:37.872 --> 03:58:43.395]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[03:58:44.255 --> 03:58:52.549]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[03:58:53.370 --> 03:58:55.534]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[03:58:55.554 --> 03:58:57.958]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night by day.
