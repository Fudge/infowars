[00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:18.985]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.951]  Because there is a war on.
[00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:21.773]  Or you're mine.
[00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:43.297]  I'm actually hyperventilating a little bit.
[00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:45.178]  The suspense is so incredible.
[00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:55.544]  What's on the line is so... ...unspeakably... ...serious.
[00:00:55.544 --> 00:01:01.287]  Boy, I've never... ...never had anxiety like this on air.
[00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:02.448]  So much.
[00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:03.828]  Down to the wire.
[00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:04.409]  Six days out.
[00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.072]  What will the globalist deep staters pull to stop the populist wave worldwide that is red, red blood, of red-blooded humans that want freedom?
[00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:17.692]  Brazil.
[00:01:17.692 --> 00:01:22.853]  A George Washington-type elected pro-gun Christian.
[00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:26.114]  Merkel being removed by, quote, far-right wing.
[00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:27.594]  She's already out of power.
[00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:29.675]  She'll still be there as a figurehead until 2021.
[00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:33.943]  Unless he completely resigns.
[00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:36.885]  And everywhere else, they're losing.
[00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:59.561]  And they believe, the globalists, our enemies, believe, and they are correct, that if they can hold on to the United States, they've got some shot of suppressing nativist, nationalist, independent groups around the world from getting control of their own destinies.
[00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:12.174]  It is wickedly authoritarian, and it's authoritarian like an aerospace engineer wants to design an airplane that's aerodynamic.
[00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:22.156]  It is the science of dehumanization and control, because that's the only shot the technocrats have of maintaining their illegitimate
[00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:27.487]  Bizarre anti-Renaissance hold.
[00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:30.710]  We need to be accelerating technological development.
[00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.491]  We need to be exploding into space.
[00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:37.895]  We need to be innovating at every level if we have a shot to make it out of here.
[00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:47.181]  The globalists are attempting to dumb down and then reduce the population in an attempt to control a planetary collapse that in many cases has already begun.
[00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.082]  Not for the reasons they claim.
[00:02:51.727 --> 00:03:14.396]  And in that war, they're going to set up, trying to dehumanize the population, that war on humanity, that will create a blowback, feedback, cultural, economic, and psychic, spiritual loop, that will absolutely have the planet fall to death.
[00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:19.217]  So, the globalists want to kill the human species and potentiality in an attempt to control it.
[00:03:19.217 --> 00:03:20.418]  It's called killing the golden goose.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.041]  They see us, though, that are resisting their program as death.
[00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:43.005]  As ignorant savages that are going to eat through all the resources, but they're the ones trying to freeze the development and trying to freeze the expansion while actually promoting the stupidest people to have more children.
[00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.986]  And it's in the Royal Commission, the original eugenics battle plan after World War II.
[00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:47.926]  It's all a fact.
[00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:58.855]  That they claim they're doing this great evil act out of some altruistic great goal, but really it's all about being directed by evil.
[00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:05.381]  Now we have some of the most dramatic footage at InfoWars.com that is exclusive to InfoWars.com as far as I know.
[00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.265]  We've sent this to Drudge Report with Don Salazar.
[00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.587]  When we come back we're going to roll the footage for you.
[00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:13.628]  For radio listeners I'll describe it.
[00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.870]  Trump ain't playing.
[00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:26.656]  Video shows hundreds of military vehicles, including Abrams frontline battle tanks, being shipped to the border.
[00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:34.862]  Footage of train heading southbound, reportedly captured in Arizona, and Trump has confirmed he's sending heavy armor.
[00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:38.425]  Armored personnel carriers, you name it.
[00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:42.988]  Supply vehicles, support vehicles, everything.
[00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:45.070]  Command and control systems,
[00:04:46.934 --> 00:04:50.820]  Because let's be honest, this is part of a larger plan to collapse the country and Trump knows it.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.201]  Show!
[00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:53.224]  Rex 84 is getting implemented!

[00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:09.038]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:17.825]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:21.308]  Six days.
[00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:32.478]  Six days, ladies and gentlemen, until the most important election in world history, the final big, giant, juicy domino to fall.
[00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:38.977]  against the globalists and signify their collapse.
[00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:54.244]  It's kind of like once the Nazis got kicked out of North Africa and they went into Russia, they started getting kicked out of there, and the Allies landed, and there was a turning point after the Battle of the Bulge where we knew they were whipped, but it was going to take some time and some blood.
[00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:57.846]  And we're at that Battle of the Bulge moment right now in the allegory.
[00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:06.069]  And we already are in the battle, and we're already smashing their main offensive.
[00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.470]  But it's on right now.
[00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.214]  This is the magic moment in history.
[00:07:11.214 --> 00:07:13.536]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:18.780]  We lose this midterm, which I don't think we are, because of all the indicators.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.884]  It'd be a massive, massive landslide.
[00:07:23.612 --> 00:07:30.896]  Where the Republicans would pick up 50 seats in the House, 5, 6, 10 seats in the Senate.
[00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:35.519]  There's a total red wave globally of populism.
[00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:39.481]  But there is such total fraud going on.
[00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:45.545]  And people who have been dead for decades voting, not just in Chicago, but in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:47.306]  And huge farms
[00:07:48.434 --> 00:08:16.213]  of phone banks and people uh... who are filling out the early voters voter uh... forms and the early voting mail-in forms from from texas to california and they're just shipping them in in mass so they've built a big seawall a big blue stinking fraudulent wall and here comes the tsunami all they gotta do is like a
[00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:22.672]  Gold posts in the NFL or in football, we just gotta get that football right between the gold posts.
[00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:26.855]  Doesn't matter if it shoots all the way up at the top, right through them, it's just gotta make it.
[00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:30.897]  And right now, that ball's... I mean, it's... We're gonna see what happens.
[00:08:30.897 --> 00:08:44.866]  There's the blue wall, but the Dems are panicking because they know the internal indices and indicators are just tsunami hammer wave.
[00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:45.727]  Just like Brazil,
[00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:49.617]  Were he won by double digits?
[00:08:49.617 --> 00:09:02.427]  Just like Merkel has been lost every election for six years, but in parliamentary manipulation and having the Muslims all vote in unison for her, she's been able to manipulate the parliament system and stay in power.
[00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:05.429]  She's gone now.
[00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:13.055]  Notice, as soon as they fall, you don't hear the mainstream media talk about it anymore.
[00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:16.078]  Populism, capitalism, the things that work, it's back.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.443]  And just like Trump's been tweeting, if you let the Democrats in, they're going to take you to the Venezuelan system.
[00:09:22.443 --> 00:09:23.564]  That's the model they like.
[00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:25.225]  And that's true.
[00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:28.026]  They want to make you poor on purpose.
[00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:36.091]  They hate your stinking guts.
[00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:36.771]  Think about that.
[00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:37.852]  Now, here's the big news.
[00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:39.513]  It just got linked up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.660]  Don Salazar article.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.841]  Trump ain't playing.
[00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:48.683]  Video shows hundreds of military vehicles being shipped to the border.
[00:09:48.683 --> 00:09:54.027]  Footage of train headed southbound, captured in Arizona.
[00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:57.569]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:00.350]  It's at NewsWars.com.
[00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.293]  And good luck Twitter and Facebook and everybody censoring it.
[00:10:04.293 --> 00:10:08.876]  It's the biggest website in the world, the biggest news site in the world, just posted it.
[00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:11.157]  And ooh, this is gonna go real viral.
[00:10:13.757 --> 00:10:25.684]  Now, we're going to get more into that in a moment, but here is something that my spidey sense and my common sense tells me is a big problem.
[00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:33.368]  I'll get to it in a moment, but first, New York Times op-ed brags of replacing embittered white conservative minority.
[00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:33.728]  So it's the
[00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:39.719]  Open culture of teaching the left to be an anti-white party.
[00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:41.240]  And then if you resist it, you're racist.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.261]  So they're just destroying the dream of the abolitionist, of Martin Luther King.
[00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:46.341]  Of course, it's the Democratic Party.
[00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:47.182]  They're a race-based party.
[00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:49.342]  They are flipping the script.
[00:10:49.342 --> 00:10:51.703]  When it's majority white, they're KKK.
[00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:54.284]  When it's majority other groups, they turn them into brown KKK.
[00:10:56.112 --> 00:11:01.616]  And it's Don Lemon, it's the whole scripting point that the biggest terror threat is white men.
[00:11:01.616 --> 00:11:05.619]  Imagine saying, the biggest threat in the world is Asians.
[00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:08.962]  Or the biggest threat in the world is, you fill in the blank, Jews.
[00:11:08.962 --> 00:11:09.942]  I didn't say that.
[00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:11.303]  I'm hypothetically saying it.
[00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.485]  They'd be, oh my God, you're the worst person in the world.
[00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:16.948]  Because it is bad to just say a group of people are bad.
[00:11:16.948 --> 00:11:21.131]  Imagine if you said the biggest problem in America is black people.
[00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:22.572]  That's what they're saying, it's white people.
[00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:26.895]  And then, they're not bringing up here from Venezuela.
[00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.596]  And they admit now, most of them are from Venezuela, not Honduras, not Guatemala.
[00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:31.076]  They were staged there by the UN.
[00:11:31.076 --> 00:11:33.657]  That country's totally collapsed.
[00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:36.159]  The only route Venezuela has is north.
[00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:39.440]  It's up there in eastern, northern South America.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.941]  Northeast South America.
[00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:42.962]  And they're all just coming right in.
[00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:43.762]  Up through Central America.
[00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:47.575]  They're not allowed to stop, they just leapfrogged from U.N.
[00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:48.276]  Center to U.N.
[00:11:48.276 --> 00:12:00.481]  Center, and now they've got the buses all lined up, funded by the Open Society, funded by USAID, funded by the Annenberg, funded by the MacArthur, funded by the Ford Foundation.
[00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:03.643]  It's all the same names.
[00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:05.064]  And there are the buses!
[00:12:05.064 --> 00:12:06.084]  And guess what?
[00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:13.728]  Oh, the first buses are set to start arriving in just three to four days in McAllen, Texas.
[00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.206]  Oh, we've been down there six or seven times.
[00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:23.789]  Six years ago, five years ago, four years ago, two years ago.
[00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:38.579]  The report, we're going to play it coming up, is the UN in charge at the Texas border, and the Border Patrol ordered to load people, they haven't even checked their identities on buses, many of which ended up being trafficked by sex traffickers.
[00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:39.820]  Print me the Washington Post again, please.
[00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:51.430]  So imagine, I'm up here trying to say it's Soros in the UN, and the media's like, that's insane, fire Lou Dobbs, my god, he says again, the sun is yellow in the daytime sky.
[00:12:55.489 --> 00:12:58.070]  When it's on record that it's Soros.
[00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.150]  It's on record they're child smuggling.
[00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.291]  It's on record it's illegal.
[00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:08.292]  But see, Obama had executive orders in place saying to the Border Patrol, you just let the people come in.
[00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:12.513]  They're like, well, most of these are little kids or adults and there's not even parents.
[00:13:12.513 --> 00:13:15.994]  And we're loading them on all these so-called charities.
[00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:17.014]  We don't even know who they are.
[00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:18.695]  And they're just disappearing.
[00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:23.216]  And a lot of them ended up in sex slavery or dead or trafficked into other countries.
[00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:27.950]  How dare Trump change that?
[00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:52.102]  And if you show up out of a desert with crying kids, and there's two men and seven kids, and the kids are crying in Spanish saying, my mama was killed, my mama was killed, oh, we're just gonna load you up on a bus with some weird, creepy, pot-bellied Democrat, who's probably got a nambla card in their wallet, and just bye-bye, because if you don't, you're abusing people.
[00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:54.583]  This is the lawlessness Democrats create in every city.
[00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.798]  And the piles of human feces.
[00:13:57.798 --> 00:13:58.158]  Why?
[00:13:58.158 --> 00:14:00.740]  Because they're devil worshippers.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.823]  They're filled with a spirit of destruction and pain.
[00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:09.447]  And there are children being abused everywhere around them because they're psychic vampires.
[00:14:11.391 --> 00:14:19.196]  When Chuck Schumer and Pelosi drive by and see feces everywhere and kids starving, it's like a fire to their satanic spirit.
[00:14:19.196 --> 00:14:20.697]  It's like warm.
[00:14:20.697 --> 00:14:24.720]  See, badness to someone who's into serious satanism is the only time they feel warm.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.084]  I've talked to top psychiatrists, you name it, who've been on, and they don't want to be put in books, but the criminologists know this.
[00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:36.548]  The child molesters, the child killers, they have nightmares, they feel like they're demon possessed, they're absolutely unhappy.
[00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:40.076]  Unless they're hurting someone really innocent.
[00:14:40.076 --> 00:14:47.243]  And then they have, there's like white light all around them, they feel warm, they feel good, they feel satisfied.
[00:14:47.243 --> 00:14:59.435]  The only time George Soros feels alive is when he's hurting innocent people and ripping countries apart and taking old people's pensions and having them freeze to death because they don't have any power for gas.
[00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:04.843]  And when you understand that, you understand everything at that point.
[00:15:04.843 --> 00:15:08.305]  They want to hurt you and your family.
[00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.726]  They want to steal your birthright.
[00:15:09.726 --> 00:15:11.027]  They want to steal your speech.
[00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:12.388]  They want to steal your genetics.
[00:15:12.388 --> 00:15:14.889]  They want to sterilize you.
[00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:19.872]  Every form of evil that they can invent, they do.
[00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:24.275]  So, that's what they're doing.
[00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:28.518]  And it's a giant criminal operation and it must be met.
[00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:30.419]  It must be dealt with head on.
[00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:39.051]  Are you gonna let Alexander Soros literally suck the spiritual essence out of this country?
[00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:42.552]  Into that black hole that are his two eyes?
[00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:44.332]  No!
[00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:45.713]  No!
[00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:48.433]  You shall not pass!
[00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:49.453]  You!
[00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:52.174]  Back to hell in the name of Jesus Christ!
[00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:53.774]  In the name of Jesus Christ!
[00:15:53.774 --> 00:15:55.855]  Back to hell, Soros!
[00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:56.755]  Back to hell!

[00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:03.917]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:09.799]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:16.300]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.341]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:17:29.372 --> 00:17:30.593]  Hear that?
[00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:35.977]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:35.977 --> 00:17:38.879]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:17:38.879 --> 00:17:42.461]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.879]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:05.641]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:16.930]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:26.898]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:32.843]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:37.427]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.927 --> 00:18:40.550]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.272]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.272 --> 00:18:52.263]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:54.926]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:59.631]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:11.658]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:27.912]  It is in the US Constitution
[00:20:31.374 --> 00:20:32.094]  It's in the U.S.
[00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:46.061]  Constitution, and it's in the Bill of Rights, and it's also in English common law that was hard fought to get the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:51.403]  And that right has been usurped all over the planet where once free peoples were allowed to have weapons.
[00:20:51.403 --> 00:20:52.944]  Only slaves are disarmed.
[00:20:52.944 --> 00:21:00.368]  It's the first sign of a free person is that they have speech, and they have the right to private property, and they have the right to
[00:21:01.673 --> 00:21:06.195]  Arms to defend themselves.
[00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:07.916]  The trifecta.
[00:21:07.916 --> 00:21:10.997]  And then, of course, with that comes the right to worship or not worship.
[00:21:10.997 --> 00:21:17.060]  Everything else flows from those founts of speech, of defense, of property.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.562]  A man's home is his castle.
[00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:22.803]  That's Magna Carta!
[00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:23.723]  1215!
[00:21:23.723 --> 00:21:26.465]  1776 was not a revolution against
[00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:38.730]  England, it was a revolution against the corrupt imperium usurping the rights of Englishmen.
[00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:45.392]  1776 was born on the field, on the plain of Runnymede.
[00:21:45.392 --> 00:21:47.853]  1776 was born in 1215. 2016
[00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:02.692]  Was born on the field of Runnymede.
[00:22:02.692 --> 00:22:08.374]  2018 in Brazil and Germany was born on the field of Runnymede.
[00:22:08.374 --> 00:22:20.997]  The epicenter, the beginning, the trigger chain reaction to the Renaissance that then swept Europe 300 years later.
[00:22:20.997 --> 00:22:26.139]  Think about it.
[00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:26.279]  So,
[00:22:29.693 --> 00:22:34.055]  People have a right to go down to the border with their firearms.
[00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:37.696]  But Trump's got it handled.
[00:22:37.696 --> 00:22:42.598]  The professional military's got it handled.
[00:22:42.598 --> 00:22:47.200]  This is so dangerous, they don't even want the National Guard running it.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.960]  Okay?
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.201]  So everybody needs to stay away from the border.
[00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:53.482]  You've got a right to go down there with your firearms.
[00:22:54.582 --> 00:23:04.951]  But I'm guaranteeing you, right now the globalists are rushing buses up, just like we predicted and James Woods predicted and others did a few weeks ago, to get them to the border a few days before.
[00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:16.242]  And the first are supposedly going to show up in three and a half days in McAllen, where they've got a friendly leftist government down there that works under the UN.
[00:23:16.242 --> 00:23:19.144]  I'm going to show newscast for you in a minute saying that.
[00:23:19.144 --> 00:23:20.866]  And they're going to bring across the people
[00:23:22.509 --> 00:23:24.791]  And if Trump stops them, they're going to show little kids.
[00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:27.293]  They hold up front and say, look, Trump's hurting little kids.
[00:23:27.293 --> 00:23:28.814]  The army's hurting little kids.
[00:23:28.814 --> 00:23:47.949]  These are people using children as shields who have been leftist organized in Venezuela and Nicaragua and San Salvador and Honduras and Guatemala that are hell hole countries.
[00:23:47.949 --> 00:23:48.830]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.731]  I've had family that
[00:23:51.121 --> 00:23:57.347]  Die to the result of their wounds living down there.
[00:23:57.347 --> 00:24:05.595]  So, it's been bad, it's real bad, and it makes Mexico look nice.
[00:24:05.595 --> 00:24:07.296]  And it's all being organized by the UN.
[00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:31.307]  And the State Department, with all the stay-behind networks of Soros, and when Lou Dobbs covered that last week, the entire system went into a conniption fit, and everything Soros had on Facebook and Twitter just hit them with hundreds of thousands of calls, millions of emails, to just harass Fox to remove that, because it was the total truth.
[00:24:32.213 --> 00:24:38.896]  This is a foreign invasion organized out of our own government, and it's criminal, and Trump should cut the funding off of the State Department to sort us.
[00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:39.456]  That's it!
[00:24:39.456 --> 00:24:40.656]  The head's off the snake!
[00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:44.298]  Gotta happen now!
[00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:45.758]  How do you think they want me off the air?
[00:24:45.758 --> 00:24:50.820]  Because my information warfare bombs are true, and they go right?
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.162]  You ever seen the videos of cruise missiles that shoot through people's windows?
[00:24:54.162 --> 00:24:54.902]  That's info wars.
[00:24:55.421 --> 00:25:04.929]  They're sittin' there drinkin' their coffee in the New World Order, and here comes the truth, right through, right, right between their eyes, through the window, and up, politically.
[00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:08.132]  That's the same thing, and when you see them freak out, you know it's the truth.
[00:25:08.132 --> 00:25:10.334]  But I don't need to see Lou Dobbs say that!
[00:25:10.334 --> 00:25:22.904]  I've been videotaping, it's on the local news all the time, that the UN runs all this, and the damn buses every day, 20, 30, 40 of them, McAllen alone, just hammering through, kids being sex-trafficked, all of it.
[00:25:22.904 --> 00:25:23.745]  So what am I getting at here?
[00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:26.795]  This is out of the Daily Caller.
[00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:28.497]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:28.497 --> 00:25:29.498]  And I totally agree with this.
[00:25:29.498 --> 00:25:29.758]  U.S.
[00:25:29.758 --> 00:25:34.003]  Border Patrol warns Texans about militias stopping migrant caravan.
[00:25:34.003 --> 00:25:42.551]  I'm not worried about real militias and military veterans down there with walkie-talkies and firearms because it's dangerous and everything and, you know, calling and helping when you see people.
[00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:45.635]  But you're going to be set up, if I was the globalist,
[00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:57.578]  I would send down infiltrators into these teams using fake names, you name it, provocateurs, to link up with other militias and other civil defense groups.
[00:25:57.578 --> 00:26:01.961]  We've got a great job in Arizona and other areas documenting as journalists what's going on.
[00:26:06.104 --> 00:26:08.766]  But you know this is the prime false flag.
[00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:10.327]  I'm sure of it now.
[00:26:10.327 --> 00:26:12.408]  Mike Adams has been sure of it.
[00:26:12.408 --> 00:26:19.492]  They are rushing those buses to the border to have the quickest confrontation they can.
[00:26:19.492 --> 00:26:25.415]  And they want to send it to Texas because they know Texas is going to have a strong response.
[00:26:25.415 --> 00:26:32.360]  And they want to make it look like Kent State with the National Guard shooting people.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.820]  And that's how the war
[00:26:35.037 --> 00:26:38.718]  of independence began on Bunker Hill.
[00:26:38.718 --> 00:26:39.978]  Is somebody shot first?
[00:26:39.978 --> 00:26:41.798]  They're not sure, probably the British.
[00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:46.299]  But when you want to start a war, you have somebody off the side who fires the shot heard around the world.
[00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:49.860]  We don't need the shot heard around the world down there.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.741]  And listen, patriots know this.
[00:26:54.741 --> 00:26:55.581]  They're staying away.
[00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:57.341]  Or you're going down there as journalists.
[00:26:57.341 --> 00:26:59.361]  You're not calling yourself malicious.
[00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:02.242]  But if you want to go into a hornet's nest, a Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:27:03.328 --> 00:27:11.631]  And Media Matters and serious operatives who obviously aren't just working at Media Matters and Southern Property Law Center.
[00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:16.953]  They are foundation level, higher than CIA, really bad people.
[00:27:16.953 --> 00:27:18.834]  They've got access to your bank accounts.
[00:27:18.834 --> 00:27:19.734]  They've got access to everybody.
[00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:21.075]  They have total access to everything.
[00:27:21.075 --> 00:27:23.776]  Top security clearance, code links to everything.
[00:27:23.776 --> 00:27:26.437]  They are the stay-behind criminal network.
[00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:28.958]  And they stick out like sore thumbs.
[00:27:29.875 --> 00:27:31.896]  They look like demonic hunchback rats.
[00:27:31.896 --> 00:27:34.457]  I don't care if they're black, white, they're just evil people.
[00:27:34.457 --> 00:27:39.399]  But you better watch your butt if you go down there, and you better say you're a journalist.
[00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:48.082]  And I get having a firearm in your vehicle, but man, you don't want to be set up by these people, because they're going to do it.
[00:27:48.082 --> 00:27:52.204]  The groups they're affiliated with stay behind networks.
[00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:55.546]  And this is an emergency situation.
[00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:58.727]  So all I can tell you is Arizona, California, Texas,
[00:28:00.435 --> 00:28:10.661]  You probably need more people down there, but it's like Yoda tells Luke Skywalker, hey, don't take your weapons into that part of the swamp.
[00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:11.122]  He's like, why?
[00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.483]  He's like, well, this isn't a place for weapons at this point.
[00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:14.344]  Is it time for weapons?
[00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:15.284]  Is it time not for weapons?
[00:28:15.284 --> 00:28:17.646]  Of course he doesn't listen and takes his weapons.
[00:28:17.646 --> 00:28:19.207]  And you see what happens.
[00:28:19.207 --> 00:28:28.653]  And anybody that's got any understanding knows this is not where the citizen militia, who's absolutely constitutional and wonderful and good, this is not
[00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:32.737]  The place for that.
[00:28:32.737 --> 00:28:34.177]  This is not the place for that.
[00:28:34.177 --> 00:28:35.278]  We trust Trump.
[00:28:35.278 --> 00:28:37.039]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:39.841]  We do need citizens down there in safe areas.
[00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:42.262]  Do what the Border Patrol says.
[00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:46.204]  Videotaping and documenting because they're going to try to set the Border Patrol up and everybody.
[00:28:46.204 --> 00:28:48.145]  And so you've got to be there to document that.
[00:28:48.145 --> 00:28:49.986]  Information warfare is what's needed now.

[00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:10.121]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:14.426]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.426 --> 00:31:17.911]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:20.053]  I still have that energy.
[00:31:20.053 --> 00:31:40.215]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:42.677]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:42.737]  1776!
[00:33:42.737 --> 00:33:43.937]  Worldwide!
[00:33:43.937 --> 00:33:44.137]  Yes!
[00:33:44.137 --> 00:33:44.357]  You!
[00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:44.778]  You!
[00:33:44.778 --> 00:33:47.879]  The globalists will pay!
[00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:51.321]  America won't die!
[00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:57.504]  You will die!
[00:33:57.504 --> 00:33:58.785]  They don't have any power!
[00:34:00.735 --> 00:34:06.938]  All they could do, like call, sleep, sleep, put us into a trance, and then suck us dry.
[00:34:06.938 --> 00:34:11.040]  But we woke up, pulling them off our necks.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.503]  And now we're getting our strength back.
[00:34:16.503 --> 00:34:18.043]  Coming for you, Globos.
[00:34:18.043 --> 00:34:22.185]  Coming for you.
[00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.366]  We're an American band.
[00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:26.367]  We're coming to your town.
[00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:29.629]  With prosperity, and fortune, and the stars.
[00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:37.777]  That's a lot better than North Korea and Venezuela, isn't it?
[00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:41.238]  Four young Chiquitas in Omaha.
[00:34:41.238 --> 00:34:51.243]  New part right here.
[00:34:51.243 --> 00:34:53.924]  Feeling good, feeling right.
[00:34:53.924 --> 00:34:57.225]  Saturday night, the hotel detective.
[00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.386]  He was out of sight.
[00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:01.150]  What are we talking about?
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.992]  Let's stop right there.
[00:35:03.992 --> 00:35:07.494]  They were gonna get to meet the boys in the band.
[00:35:07.494 --> 00:35:08.295]  Good, good song.
[00:35:08.295 --> 00:35:10.716]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:35:10.716 --> 00:35:12.437]  I'm feeling victory.
[00:35:12.437 --> 00:35:14.618]  What about you?
[00:35:14.618 --> 00:35:15.599]  I'm feeling victory here.
[00:35:17.284 --> 00:35:21.805]  Now, exactly what does that victory portend?
[00:35:21.805 --> 00:35:23.986]  And what is the shape of that victory?
[00:35:23.986 --> 00:35:34.769]  Because you can feel, and you can see, and you can smell, and you can put the temporal evidence together as well, and get a clear picture from a distance.
[00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:42.432]  But like a mirage, you know you're approaching something good, but is it what you thought it was?
[00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:46.253]  Like the Garth Brooks song, some of God's greatest gifts?
[00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:51.275]  For unanswered prayers?
[00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:53.457]  I think we're going to win this election.
[00:35:53.457 --> 00:36:01.984]  But even if the enemy somehow is able to steal it, victory is close.
[00:36:01.984 --> 00:36:10.072]  But, like a video game, or like any chapter in a book, or the way life really works, as soon as we've slayed this big dragon,
[00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:19.637]  And then walked up to the top of the next hill, we're going to see something 20 times worse, but we're going to have confidence.
[00:36:19.637 --> 00:36:30.785]  And remember what we went through, and we're going to look down from the top of the hill to the thing we thought was so big, and it's going to be little, and we're going to think, is it far away and looks small?
[00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:38.650]  And then we walk back down the hill, and by the time we even get there, what we were fighting has melted away.
[00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.871]  It's not even dust, we say.
[00:36:43.507 --> 00:36:45.267]  You see how that works?
[00:36:45.267 --> 00:36:47.428]  It's all an illusion.
[00:36:47.428 --> 00:36:48.928]  Of course people want prosperity.
[00:36:48.928 --> 00:36:50.948]  Of course humans can do anything.
[00:36:50.948 --> 00:36:52.389]  We're made in the image of the big guy.
[00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:59.590]  He didn't dump us out on this planet to play tiddlywinks.
[00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.730]  And the globalists know that and they just want to control it.
[00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.011]  They're like, oh my god, this is incredible.
[00:37:04.011 --> 00:37:05.351]  We've got to be in charge of this.
[00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:07.271]  Don't let them know how amazing they are.
[00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:11.332]  Tell them they're crap constantly and they're killing the earth while we're actually killing it.
[00:37:12.415 --> 00:37:18.178]  Because our God says kill it!
[00:37:18.178 --> 00:37:20.500]  This is quite the Halloween special so far, isn't it?
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.602]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:37:24.602 --> 00:37:31.026]  Let me get serious here.
[00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:35.289]  Just Rob Zombie's rendition of American bands of
[00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:39.954]  Is it Underground Railroad or whatever?
[00:37:39.954 --> 00:37:40.655]  It's too good.
[00:37:40.655 --> 00:37:44.977]  Maybe we should hear that song again.
[00:37:44.977 --> 00:37:45.637]  Okay.
[00:37:45.637 --> 00:37:46.117]  All right.
[00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:47.338]  Let me just stop for a minute.
[00:37:47.338 --> 00:37:48.558]  Just stop for a minute.
[00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:54.361]  We got a lot of serious stuff to cover here.
[00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:58.122]  There's something really important I was going to hit when we came back in on a break.
[00:37:58.122 --> 00:38:00.884]  And I got a little bit flummoxed.
[00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:07.295]  I know what it is I want to cover, but I'm having trouble finding my article.
[00:38:07.295 --> 00:38:08.996]  Here it is.
[00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:12.378]  And so I'm going to kind of reconnoiter here for a minute.
[00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:14.360]  And then when I come back in the next segment, I'll get into it.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:21.525]  But Kanye West did not come out against President Trump.
[00:38:21.525 --> 00:38:22.886]  The media went with that lie.
[00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:30.331]  What he came out against was Candace Owens speaking for him
[00:38:32.338 --> 00:38:35.203]  And getting too big for her britches.
[00:38:35.203 --> 00:38:38.049]  And I'm not in the business of, you know, fawning after celebrities.
[00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:38.890]  I like Kanye West.
[00:38:40.072 --> 00:38:48.199]  And, my friend, I don't pay attention to pop music very much, but once I saw, years ago, Gay Fish and the whole South Park thing, I thought, this is really good.
[00:38:48.199 --> 00:38:49.100]  I like this song.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.021]  I listen to Gay Fish just routinely.
[00:38:51.021 --> 00:38:53.403]  It's on my, you know, list of music.
[00:38:53.403 --> 00:38:56.165]  It's a comedy that the South Park brothers came up with.
[00:38:56.165 --> 00:38:58.427]  A little funny piece.
[00:38:58.427 --> 00:39:01.370]  And people said, well, that's what Kanye really sounds like.
[00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.692]  So I got on the Spotify and I typed in, you know, Kanye.
[00:39:05.473 --> 00:39:06.874]  And I started like this.
[00:39:06.874 --> 00:39:07.454]  Coal Digger?
[00:39:07.454 --> 00:39:08.175]  All these songs out.
[00:39:08.175 --> 00:39:09.296]  This is the rap I like.
[00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:10.997]  Well, no wonder this guy's so famous.
[00:39:10.997 --> 00:39:11.797]  This is good stuff.
[00:39:11.797 --> 00:39:15.180]  Because most of the stuff I hear, you know, rap on the radio, it's like, it's like new country.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.300]  I just can't listen to it.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.082]  Kanye West, it's all really good.
[00:39:18.082 --> 00:39:19.803]  It's very diverse music as well.
[00:39:19.803 --> 00:39:21.784]  Every song doesn't sound the same.
[00:39:21.784 --> 00:39:31.991]  Shub, well, I'll tell the story when we come back from break, but it's important because he's a bellwether and they're trying to destroy him for what he's done.
[00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.293]  And then he had to put the brakes on
[00:39:36.775 --> 00:39:42.559]  Because he did not design that shirt, and he did not give her permission to do that.
[00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:48.404]  And that's the one thing that really makes artists mad, is people not just taking credit for something they've done.
[00:39:48.404 --> 00:39:50.085]  Most artists can handle that.
[00:39:50.085 --> 00:39:53.808]  Don't say, I did something when I didn't.
[00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:54.828]  It's like politics.
[00:39:54.828 --> 00:39:58.071]  I didn't say get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:00.693]  Believe me, if I said it, it'd be very clear.
[00:40:00.693 --> 00:40:02.314]  And boy, me and him were in a lot of trouble at that point.
[00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:05.566]  We get put in prison for that.
[00:40:05.566 --> 00:40:07.347]  And I don't think that was what we need to do.
[00:40:07.347 --> 00:40:09.408]  We need to expose these liars.
[00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:12.009]  And all of them aren't bad.
[00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:14.691]  So, that's being raped.
[00:40:14.691 --> 00:40:17.972]  Come on, little fish.
[00:40:17.972 --> 00:40:20.554]  That's being raped.
[00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:31.219]  When somebody lies about you and lies about who you are, and then you don't have a voice to counter it, it pisses you off.
[00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:32.740]  Well, Kanye had a voice to counter it.
[00:40:33.592 --> 00:40:38.994]  But he couldn't do it like a little bitch and just go, I didn't really mean that.
[00:40:38.994 --> 00:40:40.474]  She just stopped that, Candace.
[00:40:40.474 --> 00:40:41.875]  I didn't really tell you that.
[00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:47.676]  No, she goes around saying, you know, and these incredibly gifted, amazing people like me and Kanye.
[00:40:47.676 --> 00:40:52.818]  So Kanye's watching all this and it's just, it's gotten a little, a little heady.
[00:40:52.818 --> 00:40:59.220]  And look, Candace Owens is a smart, beautiful lady, done a lot of great work, but she's gone from nowhere with Paul Watson helping launch her to the very top.
[00:41:00.481 --> 00:41:08.689]  And you know, she got too big a head and started speaking like Kanye West was her running dog.
[00:41:08.689 --> 00:41:12.372]  And so he knocked it down.
[00:41:12.372 --> 00:41:13.053]  But if you read
[00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:35.471]  Even the Atlantic, what Kanye West Trump phase meant, he's still saying individualism, think on your own, love everybody, America's great, capitalism, investment, Elon Musk, but he doesn't want to be pigeonholed just as a Republican and then have his identity taken by other people who don't even realize they're taking his identity.
[00:41:35.471 --> 00:41:38.874]  See, I said I'd cover Kanye West next segment, I just did it, didn't I?
[00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:40.695]  And so that's what it is.
[00:41:40.695 --> 00:41:41.056]  He's like,
[00:41:42.008 --> 00:41:44.249]  You're not going to launch clothing lines in my name.
[00:41:44.249 --> 00:41:45.770]  You're not going to own me.
[00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.491]  I'm not somebody for you to exploit.
[00:41:47.491 --> 00:41:49.271]  I don't let the record companies do that.
[00:41:49.271 --> 00:41:50.292]  I'm my own person.
[00:41:50.292 --> 00:41:56.595]  Don't become what I'm trying to get away from.
[00:41:56.595 --> 00:41:57.796]  So that's what happened with Kanye West.
[00:41:57.796 --> 00:42:00.097]  And I respect him, you know, more than ever.
[00:42:00.097 --> 00:42:03.078]  Because he doesn't need to become a Republican tool as well.
[00:42:03.078 --> 00:42:03.798]  Which Trump knows.
[00:42:03.798 --> 00:42:06.300]  That's why Trump's like, please don't come hug me.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:06.800]  Stop.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.240]  No.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.601]  Kanye, just stop saying how much you love me.
[00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:10.746]  Because Trump's smart.
[00:42:10.746 --> 00:42:13.026]  He's like, man, this guy's an independent.
[00:42:13.026 --> 00:42:15.367]  He's going to really get hurt bad for this.
[00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:18.088]  He's already done so much with Jim Brown and everybody else.
[00:42:18.088 --> 00:42:21.450]  Kanye, I think you've already taken one for the team.
[00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.050]  You need to stop.
[00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.592]  Because Trump's lost $2 billion doing this for the country.
[00:42:26.592 --> 00:42:32.694]  He's thinking, is Kanye really this damn tough that almost no one else can take what I take, what Alex Jones takes?
[00:42:32.694 --> 00:42:33.935]  Can this guy take it?
[00:42:33.935 --> 00:42:35.555]  He's like, Kanye, can you take it?
[00:42:35.555 --> 00:42:37.456]  Because you really need to watch out, man.
[00:42:38.502 --> 00:42:39.583]  And boy, he went and hugged Trump.
[00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.706]  And imagine what they're going to Kanye behind the scenes.
[00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:45.390]  So Kanye's kind of like, yeah, don't take advantage of me, Candace.
[00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.072]  And I'm going to kind of sit back here a little bit.
[00:42:47.072 --> 00:42:49.094]  And I'm going to kind of pull back a little bit.
[00:42:49.094 --> 00:42:53.079]  But I still support freedom and think it's OK to be a Republican.
[00:42:53.079 --> 00:42:54.621]  You understand?
[00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:56.483]  Kanye West is an American man.
[00:42:56.483 --> 00:42:57.004]  So is Trump.
[00:42:59.582 --> 00:43:06.745]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:44:03.689 --> 00:44:07.152]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:44:07.152 --> 00:44:08.934]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:44:08.934 --> 00:44:12.196]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:44:12.196 --> 00:44:18.982]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I'd be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:44:18.982 --> 00:44:24.066]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[00:44:24.406 --> 00:44:30.512]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:44:30.512 --> 00:44:33.515]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:34.596]  I want to keep going.
[00:44:34.596 --> 00:44:38.420]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.442]  I want to push all the way.
[00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:41.723]  I've committed to do that.
[00:44:41.723 --> 00:44:44.465]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:46.888]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:44:47.368 --> 00:44:48.690]  I will never falter.
[00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.033]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:51.974]  I physically will.
[00:44:51.974 --> 00:44:58.722]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[00:45:00.089 --> 00:45:06.592]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[00:45:06.592 --> 00:45:13.415]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[00:45:13.415 --> 00:45:28.941]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:45:30.106 --> 00:45:33.929]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:45:55.603 --> 00:45:59.706]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:46:00.348 --> 00:46:01.476]  Words cannot describe
[00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:03.971]  We're good to go.
[00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:41.935]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:46:41.935 --> 00:46:43.115]  We'll win.
[00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:46.037]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:51.339]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[00:46:51.339 --> 00:46:53.180]  And you're right, to the market.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.862]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[00:46:56.862 --> 00:46:58.422]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[00:46:58.422 --> 00:46:59.283]  We need your support.
[00:46:59.283 --> 00:46:59.843]  I'm counting on you.
[00:47:03.406 --> 00:47:19.157]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.157 --> 00:47:21.138]  Short is strong.
[00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:22.519]  Not all short straws are bad.
[00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:24.881]  It's good to take the dangerous mission.
[00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:34.947]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:47:34.947 --> 00:47:38.428]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.428 --> 00:47:42.010]  That which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:46.612]  Alright, let me tell you who's coming up today.
[00:47:46.612 --> 00:47:47.192]  I should have done that.
[00:47:47.192 --> 00:47:49.553]  Gavin McGinnis.
[00:47:49.553 --> 00:48:00.258]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of accounts associated with anyone even praising him or saying you like him.
[00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:09.510]  And your Facebook is wiped out if you read the press release by Facebook.
[00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.570]  Because they say he's a militia.
[00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:22.672]  Because he has the proud boys, who are proud Western chauvinists, and who never offensively attack, that's why they can never get arrested.
[00:48:22.672 --> 00:48:27.873]  But when the anti-professors meth heads show up, and start hitting kids in the head with bike locks,
[00:48:28.988 --> 00:48:31.213]  They beat the living hell out of him everywhere.
[00:48:31.213 --> 00:48:35.863]  I mean, one proud boy, mercenarily takes out like ten methods.
[00:48:42.796 --> 00:48:46.498]  It's like the Matrix when Neo's fighting and Agent Smith's in slow motion.
[00:48:46.498 --> 00:48:48.360]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.561]  In fact, we show some TKOs, you know.
[00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:51.802]  There's a lot of them.
[00:48:51.802 --> 00:48:52.482]  They always show this one.
[00:48:52.482 --> 00:48:53.723]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:48:53.723 --> 00:48:55.484]  Oh, you try to hit me with a metal baton and kill me.
[00:48:55.484 --> 00:48:56.225]  Here.
[00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:56.985]  Bam!
[00:48:56.985 --> 00:49:05.291]  Wipe you out, and then perfectly, when the woman tries to trick me to hit her, I don't do it.
[00:49:05.291 --> 00:49:06.292]  That's what that guy's thinking.
[00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.911]  It's just beautiful.
[00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:08.251]  Oh, here.
[00:49:08.251 --> 00:49:08.691]  You hit me.
[00:49:08.691 --> 00:49:08.952]  Oh, here.
[00:49:08.952 --> 00:49:09.933]  Now, watch this.
[00:49:09.933 --> 00:49:11.194]  Oh, I'm so scared of you.
[00:49:11.194 --> 00:49:12.916]  A meth head with your metal baton.
[00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:14.177]  Here.
[00:49:14.177 --> 00:49:15.478]  Oh, you tried to kill me just now?
[00:49:15.478 --> 00:49:19.642]  I'll TKO you.
[00:49:19.642 --> 00:49:20.883]  That's not even a technical knockout.
[00:49:20.883 --> 00:49:21.484]  It's a knockout.
[00:49:23.703 --> 00:49:24.804]  So they're in New York.
[00:49:24.804 --> 00:49:28.525]  They go, we're not going to let Gavin McGinnis speak at a restaurant in America.
[00:49:28.525 --> 00:49:30.787]  We're going to go down there and beat their asses.
[00:49:30.787 --> 00:49:38.931]  And we walk up as meth-head professors that call for killing the president and everybody else, and we start throwing bottles and punching them, and they beat the hell out of us.
[00:49:38.931 --> 00:49:44.694]  And the New York police go, we can't allow Americans to stand up.
[00:49:44.694 --> 00:49:47.635]  We're going to arrest some of you.
[00:49:47.635 --> 00:49:51.097]  And then they've got the attorney generals in different states investigating it.
[00:49:56.527 --> 00:50:02.369]  And then Facebook says, we're banning all of you.
[00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:21.236]  And it says that if you give aid and comfort, it says, it doesn't say it in that way, it says if you praise or support them, if you praise them, if you on Facebook say you like the Proud Boys or Gavin McInnes, you will be banned.
[00:50:21.236 --> 00:50:24.197]  And then what's next?
[00:50:24.197 --> 00:50:24.977]  Sky's the limit.
[00:50:27.952 --> 00:50:31.317]  And if we go along with this, our journey to tyranny is complete.
[00:50:31.317 --> 00:50:44.014]  Facebook's lost a couple hundred billion dollars in value, and the word is, by next year, it's going to completely tank.
[00:50:44.014 --> 00:50:45.335]  Which is bittersweet, because
[00:50:46.795 --> 00:50:51.577]  I don't want to bring the rest of the stock market down with it, but it is a giant criminal operation.
[00:50:51.577 --> 00:51:02.181]  It's just added total censorship and defamation to its quiver, where they take you off and then lie about you.
[00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:06.043]  Yeah, that's the Wall Street Journal spinning, and, oh, Facebook's slowing, and the stock's down.
[00:51:06.043 --> 00:51:07.163]  No, the truth is, they're scared.
[00:51:07.163 --> 00:51:08.904]  They're bailing out.
[00:51:08.904 --> 00:51:11.045]  Ever seen rats leaving a sinking ship that's on fire?
[00:51:14.465 --> 00:51:17.187]  But be careful because that fire could burn us up too.
[00:51:17.187 --> 00:51:23.371]  We need to get away from that ship though.
[00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:27.614]  Just let it kind of slowly drift off into the ship graveyard over there.
[00:51:27.614 --> 00:51:31.276]  That's be better for you over there.
[00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:33.658]  The Phantom Zone just gone over there.
[00:51:33.658 --> 00:51:34.538]  You want to put us there?
[00:51:34.538 --> 00:51:36.660]  How about you go there, Zuckerberg?
[00:51:37.892 --> 00:51:40.913]  Who thinks his users are dumb effers.
[00:51:40.913 --> 00:51:45.995]  What type of creep makes 100 billion dollars himself and then hates the people?
[00:51:45.995 --> 00:51:47.915]  Oh, they made me hundreds of billions.
[00:51:47.915 --> 00:51:54.177]  I hate them.
[00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.157]  I love our listeners.
[00:51:55.157 --> 00:51:56.438]  I love our supporters.
[00:51:56.438 --> 00:51:59.859]  I think of you like my guts and my heart and my eyeballs.
[00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.832]  I just, like, I worry about myself.
[00:52:02.832 --> 00:52:03.833]  Like, oh, I don't want to get cancer.
[00:52:03.833 --> 00:52:05.013]  I need to be a little more healthy.
[00:52:05.013 --> 00:52:05.754]  I love myself.
[00:52:05.754 --> 00:52:06.914]  I love my listeners.
[00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:07.535]  I love Trump.
[00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:08.295]  I love Matt Drudge.
[00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:09.836]  I love my crew.
[00:52:09.836 --> 00:52:11.357]  I was just being mean to the crew.
[00:52:11.357 --> 00:52:12.598]  I'm being mean to me.
[00:52:12.598 --> 00:52:15.080]  These people don't even have any sense of that.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.743]  They're crazy people!
[00:52:19.743 --> 00:52:20.323]  They're crazy!
[00:52:23.735 --> 00:52:26.436]  Because they're sociopaths and psychopaths.
[00:52:26.436 --> 00:52:30.278]  You can only do the crap they do if you're a sociopath or a psychopath.
[00:52:30.278 --> 00:52:33.119]  And so they build their psychopath world because they get in control.
[00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:35.320]  Because normal people don't want control.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.720]  I don't want to run my neighbor's life.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.581]  I don't want to control what you're doing.
[00:52:38.581 --> 00:52:40.442]  Just let me live.
[00:52:40.442 --> 00:52:49.125]  But see, it doesn't work like that, does it?
[00:52:49.125 --> 00:52:53.147]  These people aren't going to get off our backs until we get them off our backs.
[00:52:54.614 --> 00:53:03.881]  Okay, so, I normally don't get into Mueller stuff, because I'm sick of Russiagate for, you know, a year, and it's pure crap, but I am under investigation.
[00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:21.775]  I've talked to, and talked to people I've talked to, maybe 30 people that have been, literally, they asked me about, when is Jones at Roger Stone's house, and who gives them the orders, and, I mean, I might talk to Roger Stone, like, twice a week on the phone about what we're going to cover on air or something.
[00:53:21.775 --> 00:53:22.836]  There's no coordination.
[00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:29.571]  It's just, it's asinine, but Mueller is getting ready for something.
[00:53:29.571 --> 00:53:35.914]  And if Trump thinks that Rosenstein, when he said the investigations of fraud is over, told the truth, I think he's wrong.
[00:53:35.914 --> 00:53:37.274]  I don't think Trump believes that.
[00:53:37.274 --> 00:53:41.416]  He just waited till after the election, but this is a nest of criminals.
[00:53:41.416 --> 00:53:48.839]  And there's other things I can't get into on air, but let me just tell you something.
[00:53:54.068 --> 00:54:10.497]  They are... I mean, if you want to be Judas Iscariot, you can contact Mueller and they'll pay you some money to say that I wear fur hats and walk around and get orders from Vladimir Putin.
[00:54:10.497 --> 00:54:14.360]  And I'm not even scared of it because it's like saying I'm a child molester.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:14.920]  It ain't true.
[00:54:19.696 --> 00:54:23.179]  And it just makes you know what crooks these people are.
[00:54:23.179 --> 00:54:24.200]  God, they're crooks, man.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.423]  People are like, well, you better be scared of Mueller.
[00:54:27.423 --> 00:54:28.364]  He's a big gangster.
[00:54:28.364 --> 00:54:30.446]  I'm fighting him because he's a gangster.
[00:54:30.446 --> 00:54:31.727]  I know how bad he is.
[00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:32.708]  Hey, you better watch out!
[00:54:32.708 --> 00:54:36.030]  Mueller's really dangerous!
[00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.552]  Yeah, I know he's dangerous!
[00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:38.593]  That's why I'm fighting him!
[00:54:39.864 --> 00:54:50.374]  I love all these men act so tough around other guys and you know at the pool hall or whatever or at the barbecue yeah I'm tough but as soon as you think somebody's dangerous and evil you get on the ground and piss all over yourselves.
[00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:55.659]  I'm going after the bad guys because I'm scared of them running my planet that my kids live on.
[00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:58.762]  It's our planet not theirs.
[00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:02.306]  What the hell is wrong with people?
[00:55:02.306 --> 00:55:04.228]  I'm going up against Mueller because he's bad.
[00:55:05.365 --> 00:55:07.627]  I'm going up against Obama because he's bad.
[00:55:07.627 --> 00:55:09.668]  I'm going up against George Soros because he's bad.
[00:55:09.668 --> 00:55:13.111]  Because my guts say I gotta do it.
[00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:16.714]  My soul says get him!
[00:55:16.714 --> 00:55:17.975]  It's not even a courage thing.
[00:55:17.975 --> 00:55:20.096]  It's like an attack dog being released.
[00:55:20.096 --> 00:55:22.458]  I want to get in there!
[00:55:22.458 --> 00:55:25.220]  You think I'm worried about whatever they do to me?
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.242]  The worse things get, the closer I get to God.
[00:55:27.242 --> 00:55:29.444]  And that's just the way it works.
[00:55:30.714 --> 00:55:31.735]  And Trump knows that too.
[00:55:31.735 --> 00:55:34.697]  Trump is on cloud nine right now.
[00:55:34.697 --> 00:55:36.158]  He loves it.
[00:55:36.158 --> 00:55:37.399]  He's fatalistic.
[00:55:37.399 --> 00:55:39.040]  He has no fear.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:46.385]  He's charging in because he believes in you!
[00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:50.128]  He's got the spirit.
[00:55:50.128 --> 00:55:55.271]  And I want to look out at the American people and say, you've got the spirit.
[00:55:55.271 --> 00:55:58.954]  Speaking of the spirit, they suppress us by
[00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:05.651]  Removing all the real trace elements that we need to survive out of the food chain.
[00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:13.878]  And iodine, true atomic iodine, is basically not in the fields, and not in the soil, and not in the plants on the surface.
[00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:18.702]  It was once plentiful, just like the seas have been 80% depleted of fish, that's a real crisis.
[00:56:18.702 --> 00:56:22.625]  The surface of the earth is almost completely devoid of real iodine.
[00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:28.110]  The stuff from the ocean is normally bound into other elements and is not absorbable.
[00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:47.917]  I am here to announce our secret project for over a year, as the oil companies put me over a barrel to get Deep Earth Crystal Source pure iodine for X2, which we're now selling out of the last bunch of, to bring you X3 Tri-Iodine.
[00:56:52.076 --> 00:57:03.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has the deep earth crystals, then it has the other two types, and it has a tiny amount of a special type of vitamin C that causes it to stay in an unoxidized form.
[00:57:03.866 --> 00:57:11.412]  We bring you X3, just like our information, is absolutely devastating to the globalists.
[00:57:11.412 --> 00:57:17.718]  Absolute kryptonite, absolute coffin nails, absolute incineration.
[00:57:20.202 --> 00:57:25.944]  There is, X2 is great, X3 is insanely good.
[00:57:25.944 --> 00:57:33.866]  Because there was a little problem with X2, with only the pure atomic iodine in its base, very small percentage of people couldn't absorb it.
[00:57:33.866 --> 00:57:40.809]  Doesn't matter, the point is with all three types and the vitamin C in this proprietary blend, it takes it to the next level of absorption.
[00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:48.071]  X3, 50% off and free shipping, out of the gates, because I want you to see how amazing it is when you get the critical element.
[00:57:53.408 --> 00:57:59.132]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.132 --> 00:58:06.997]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.997 --> 00:58:10.159]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[00:58:50.214 --> 00:58:52.915]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:58:52.915 --> 00:58:59.276]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:58:59.276 --> 00:59:01.036]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:17.420]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.220]  I think so.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:55.623]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.096 --> 01:00:25.350]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:43.392]  You know, they say that great minds think alike.
[01:00:43.392 --> 01:00:53.480]  And since I'm banned on Twitter and almost everywhere else, I thought about going out on Halloween tonight in Austin, which is crazy.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.443]  I mean, wow, you want to see women on display.
[01:00:56.443 --> 01:00:57.744]  It's unbelievable.
[01:00:57.744 --> 01:01:01.767]  It's like the Brazilian carnival or something.
[01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:03.169]  And I was going to go as a gay frog.
[01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:12.344]  In fact, I may show up downtown tonight as a gay frog, and we can even stream on Facebook and Twitter, because if it's not Alex Jones, as long as I don't say I'm Alex Jones, it's okay.
[01:01:12.344 --> 01:01:13.625]  Only I, the person, am banned.
[01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:16.947]  It's no big deal to have a person banned showing up on a platform.
[01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:18.108]  It's totally normal.
[01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:23.411]  But Gavin McGinnis has been banned on hundreds of sites in their press release.
[01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:30.616]  Facebook said, they said, if you praise him or support him, you're banned.
[01:01:32.062 --> 01:01:33.463]  That's a new level, wow!
[01:01:33.463 --> 01:01:36.526]  So they don't even deny their censoring.
[01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.728]  Congress and Trump haven't really done anything yet, so it's just green-lighted.
[01:01:39.728 --> 01:01:47.554]  So, I know we're actually streaming some of these shows on Facebook, even though it's supposedly banned there, but if I have Gavin McGinnis on, it'll really get banned.
[01:01:47.554 --> 01:01:52.358]  So I'm not having Gavin McGinnis on of Get Off My Lawn at CRTV.
[01:01:52.358 --> 01:01:54.460]  No, it's a werewolf!
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.621]  So this is okay to have on.
[01:01:56.621 --> 01:01:58.563]  I guess you ate Gavin, were you sent by Facebook?
[01:02:00.054 --> 01:02:06.278]  Yeah, I was actually sent over by the DNC to take care of him, and he's gone now.
[01:02:06.278 --> 01:02:13.002]  But, uh, I still have him inside of me, so technically you kind of have him on the show.
[01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:18.946]  So we need the woodsman to come with a little red riding hood and with a hatchet and cut Gavin McGinnis out of your stomach.
[01:02:18.946 --> 01:02:19.347]  Oh, here.
[01:02:19.347 --> 01:02:20.707]  God, that thing is hot!
[01:02:20.707 --> 01:02:22.328]  I can't do that bit for very long.
[01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:22.689]  No, I hear you.
[01:02:22.689 --> 01:02:23.989]  I'm gonna have to be a gay frog later today.
[01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:24.370]  It's not him.
[01:02:26.084 --> 01:02:34.101]  Hey, the good part is, I'm going to be able to get a relationship with Brian Stelter on Grindr.
[01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:36.526]  You know, the crazy part about all of this is...
[01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:38.808]  They're doing it.
[01:02:38.808 --> 01:02:44.673]  They're censoring conservative voices because they think it'll help them win the election because they know they're going to lose.
[01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:48.777]  But all this fascism does is make them less appealing.
[01:02:48.777 --> 01:02:50.799]  That's why you have the walk away movement.
[01:02:50.799 --> 01:02:52.401]  That's why you have Blexit.
[01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:59.968]  Because when these people act like hysterical babies that want to take their ball home because they're not winning, they go, yeah, I don't want to play with you anymore.
[01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:04.043]  You know, we're on the same page.
[01:03:04.043 --> 01:03:10.706]  I was going to make the joke about Little Red Riding Hood, the wolf, and then, you know, he cuts Little Red Riding Hood out of it, and you actually kind of made that allusion.
[01:03:10.706 --> 01:03:12.847]  But seriously, I agree.
[01:03:12.847 --> 01:03:16.369]  All evidence shows, globally, there's a huge political awakening.
[01:03:16.369 --> 01:03:17.810]  Populists are being elected.
[01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:19.711]  What do you think is going to happen in six days?
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.246]  There's going to be a landslide for the right, a massive landslide, and I'm not going to be near my house.
[01:03:27.246 --> 01:03:31.511]  I'm going to be on vacation in Jamaica because this country is going to explode.
[01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:38.117]  I mean, if they're this hysterical now, I have my neighbors, people back in the suburbs.
[01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:40.320]  I got my neighbors attacking my house already.
[01:03:41.047 --> 01:03:47.733]  I've got people in the next community over threatening me and saying, we don't want you to live two towns away from us.
[01:03:47.733 --> 01:03:49.855]  That's just like one tiny thing.
[01:03:49.855 --> 01:03:51.657]  I got death threats all over the place.
[01:03:51.657 --> 01:03:54.820]  If I go to, when I walk down the street, I get people screaming at me.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.623]  I mean, this, this is totally different from last week.
[01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:00.745]  And that week was totally different from the week before.
[01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:04.068]  It just keeps going up and up and up.
[01:04:04.068 --> 01:04:05.690]  So you're saying it's totally exponential.
[01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:16.384]  It's, I mean, every time I have a shower, I come out and I check my phone and there's 10 new major emergencies or catastrophes or something going on.
[01:04:16.384 --> 01:04:25.511]  I mean, and the way they're behaving, like, you know, another thing, this is a slightly separate topic, but there's a horrific shooting in Pittsburgh and you think, all right, at least this week
[01:04:26.323 --> 01:04:36.890]  Let's forget our political differences, come together, all different religions, all different politicals, everyone from every end of the spectrum, come together and mourn the loss of these people.
[01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.871]  But no!
[01:04:37.871 --> 01:04:41.914]  They're using it as a chance to further their political gains.
[01:04:41.914 --> 01:04:49.879]  So they're saying, they're saying the shooting and Trump and Republicans... What you're saying is they have no bottom.
[01:04:49.879 --> 01:04:53.902]  And so as they fall into this, it's just a spectacle.
[01:04:53.902 --> 01:04:54.442]  And you're right.
[01:04:55.803 --> 01:04:56.724]  I have leftist neighbors.
[01:04:56.724 --> 01:04:58.025]  They don't want me living near them.
[01:04:58.025 --> 01:04:58.605]  Four doors down!
[01:04:58.605 --> 01:05:00.886]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[01:06:33.607 --> 01:06:43.952]  And I was just talking to Gavin McInnes, who just joined us from CRTV, get off my lawn, one of the top true Americana, true conservative patriots.
[01:06:45.356 --> 01:06:48.638]  Founder of the Proud Boys that's been banned off of now Facebook.
[01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:50.199]  It's all inserted.
[01:06:50.199 --> 01:06:53.641]  We're talking about people in his neighborhood saying, get out of here.
[01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:55.682]  And people in town over saying, get out of here.
[01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:56.463]  We're coming after you.
[01:06:57.717 --> 01:06:59.158]  I deal with that too.
[01:06:59.158 --> 01:07:07.786]  Most of my neighbors are conservative or nationalists and they love me, but just so happens the control freaks that run the neighborhood association don't like me.
[01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:10.308]  And so other people can park cars however they want.
[01:07:10.308 --> 01:07:12.310]  It's like white glove inspection.
[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:13.210]  Anything's wrong.
[01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.932]  Trash cans aren't in in five minutes.
[01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:16.373]  Fines!
[01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:18.155]  And the pleasure these people have
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.041]  It's unbelievable!
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.942]  Bolsonaro wins in Brazil, as Merkel's out of power in Germany.
[01:07:38.942 --> 01:07:42.824]  She's still Chancellor, but her party's out of power in Parliament.
[01:07:42.824 --> 01:07:44.264]  That's how that works, so there's another election.
[01:07:44.264 --> 01:07:46.045]  She should resign, but she hasn't.
[01:07:46.045 --> 01:07:50.147]  And just everywhere, nationalism's exploding, capitalism's being promoted.
[01:07:50.147 --> 01:07:59.152]  What are they going to do as they reach the... I mean, I asked him two years ago, what's the peak of SJW insanity?
[01:07:59.152 --> 01:08:01.173]  He said, oh, I think it's going to get far worse.
[01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:02.594]  So let's first get back into
[01:08:03.755 --> 01:08:07.339]  You're your neighbors wanting you out because they're such wonderful top.
[01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:14.766]  They want unwashed felons, smuggling children, firebombing Mexican police to marching and everything free.
[01:08:14.766 --> 01:08:24.917]  But you in America, the founder of Vice, so many other, you know, comedian movies, you aren't allowed to be Americana and think that, you know, men can be men.
[01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:25.858]  You're a bad person.
[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:32.833]  Well, someone makes up a narrative, and they don't have to do any research or have any basis to it.
[01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:39.297]  The Southern Poverty Law Center will say you're part of a hate group or you advocate for hate, and no one goes, really?
[01:08:39.297 --> 01:08:40.097]  That sounds unusual.
[01:08:40.097 --> 01:08:41.598]  They just go, oh, that's a given.
[01:08:41.598 --> 01:08:46.741]  You're a professional hate guy, and you spread hate across the land.
[01:08:46.741 --> 01:08:52.764]  And then that allegation, people go, okay, so now that that's a given, that this person is a Nazi and he just loves hate,
[01:08:53.451 --> 01:08:54.473]  I have to get rid of him.
[01:08:54.473 --> 01:08:55.956]  It's like killing Hitler in his crib.
[01:08:55.956 --> 01:08:58.200]  I have to prevent World War 4.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.089]  And you think, if I was a high school teacher and someone submitted that as an essay, I would just write F!
[01:09:04.389 --> 01:09:05.930]  You didn't do any of your homework!
[01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.492]  You just assumed that you got Mengele on the line?
[01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.273]  No, you don't, dummy!
[01:09:10.273 --> 01:09:12.014]  Have you even talked to the person?
[01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:15.636]  No, I never spoke to him because I don't want to give hate a platform.
[01:09:15.636 --> 01:09:19.418]  Yeah, but how do you know that he's about hate if you've never spoken to him?
[01:09:19.418 --> 01:09:27.243]  Well, I saw an edited video with everything taken out of context with just little snippets of quotes without any background to each quote.
[01:09:27.856 --> 01:09:30.438]  Yeah, that doesn't count as homework.
[01:09:30.438 --> 01:09:33.320]  That's called a collage.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:42.067]  Basically, every time they present research, it's like those kidnapping letters, where each letter comes from a different part of the magazine.
[01:09:42.067 --> 01:09:43.088]  It's word salad.
[01:09:43.088 --> 01:09:43.789]  It's word salad.
[01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:45.534]  It's word salad.
[01:09:45.534 --> 01:09:50.735]  It's like when, on Howard Stern, when they have them say things like, My name is Bill O'Reilly.
[01:09:50.735 --> 01:09:51.836]  I am gay.
[01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:52.996]  And you go, See?
[01:09:52.996 --> 01:09:54.596]  He's just said he's gay.
[01:09:54.596 --> 01:09:57.157]  No, that's not what he said at all.
[01:09:57.157 --> 01:09:58.677]  Like, look at Megyn Kelly.
[01:09:58.677 --> 01:10:05.579]  She said, she said that when I was a kid, people would wear blackface and no one had a problem with it if the person was dressing up as a thing.
[01:10:05.579 --> 01:10:07.719]  She didn't even say whether it was good or bad.
[01:10:07.719 --> 01:10:10.500]  She just said, this was the culture when I was a kid.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:10.820]  Boom!
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.081]  Fired.
[01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:13.462]  You like blackface.
[01:10:13.462 --> 01:10:13.702]  What?
[01:10:13.702 --> 01:10:14.122]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:14.463]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:14.463 --> 01:10:15.023]  Nope.
[01:10:15.023 --> 01:10:16.284]  Apologies aren't good enough.
[01:10:16.284 --> 01:10:19.647]  Rot in hell.
[01:10:19.647 --> 01:10:24.130]  And I love how those that grovel to it get destroyed the most.
[01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.252]  Oh, remember that guy?
[01:10:26.252 --> 01:10:27.533]  Forget his name.
[01:10:27.533 --> 01:10:29.914]  Brett Eisner or something.
[01:10:29.914 --> 01:10:31.696]  He did the movie Hightower.
[01:10:31.696 --> 01:10:32.516]  He was a producer.
[01:10:32.516 --> 01:10:33.037]  Brett Ratner.
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:38.392]  And, uh, he was drunk at a Q&A, and, uh, they said, do you guys rehearse at all?
[01:10:38.392 --> 01:10:39.692]  And he used a bad word.
[01:10:39.692 --> 01:10:45.895]  He said, uh, rehearsal is for, and then he used the F-A-G word for homosexuals.
[01:10:45.895 --> 01:10:48.856]  And, uh, he just said rehearse, uh, rehearsal is for that, that word.
[01:10:48.856 --> 01:10:50.877]  Uh, just a dumb quip, right?
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.642]  He apologized.
[01:10:52.642 --> 01:10:53.943]  They said it wasn't good enough.
[01:10:53.943 --> 01:11:03.516]  He did an apology tour of America where he would go to different cities and apologize to various communities around the country.
[01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:06.080]  And he was... I don't like that guy and I'm not advocating that quote.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.483]  But that was still not good enough for them, because it's not about the truth.
[01:11:10.483 --> 01:11:13.665]  They don't want to say, hey Megyn Kelly, you screwed up, apologize.
[01:11:13.665 --> 01:11:14.506]  They want power.
[01:11:14.506 --> 01:11:15.847]  They want to be able to crush you.
[01:11:15.847 --> 01:11:23.652]  And if they can make up a story, or they can make you uncomfortable in your community, they can get you fired, they can kick you off social media, that's power.
[01:11:23.652 --> 01:11:24.913]  That's all they really care about.
[01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:25.093]  I agree.
[01:11:25.093 --> 01:11:27.275]  So what about the parallax view, though?
[01:11:27.275 --> 01:11:33.139]  They don't understand that when they crush us, it only makes us mythical creatures at the level we're at.
[01:11:33.139 --> 01:11:34.260]  I feel sorry for the average
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:42.926]  The guy that owns an auto body shop or the average lady that owns a medical lab or something or just a school teacher.
[01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:45.648]  They go out and say they like Trump on Twitter or Facebook.
[01:11:45.648 --> 01:11:48.030]  They get fired from the school they work at.
[01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:58.238]  That's the real fascism saying, oh, you've been refused even though you have a 3.9 grade point average because you liked Donald Trump on Twitter.
[01:11:58.238 --> 01:12:00.320]  That's the clear and present danger.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.921]  These are real authoritarians.
[01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:04.862]  It's a form of terrorism.
[01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:15.269]  You know, I don't want to trivialize victims of actual attacks who were killed, but this sort of mental trauma, getting people fired, getting them ostracized... Hold on, let me, don't apologize.
[01:12:15.269 --> 01:12:27.257]  The definition of terrorism in Merriam-Webster's dictionary, and the classic one is, using violence or threats of violence or economic harm or other forms of harassment to get a political or economic goal.
[01:12:27.257 --> 01:12:32.781]  So when they're trying to deplatform you, bankrupt you, ruin your life, kick you out of your house, that's terrorism, sir.
[01:12:33.802 --> 01:12:42.009]  Every Trump supporter in the on the on the east and west coast and in cities like Madison, Berkeley, any kind of liberal town.
[01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:43.991]  He has lost family connections.
[01:12:43.991 --> 01:12:45.813]  They are uninvited to Thanksgiving.
[01:12:45.813 --> 01:12:48.435]  They lose their aunts and uncles, their cousins, siblings.
[01:12:49.045 --> 01:12:52.428]  Aren't speaking because of this divisive attitude.
[01:12:52.428 --> 01:12:56.172]  And the irony of it all is they claim they're about inclusion.
[01:12:56.172 --> 01:13:06.823]  This one woman who was trying to get me to move from this community said I'm having a vigil in front of your house to tell you that hate has no home here and it's about inclusion.
[01:13:06.823 --> 01:13:12.689]  So under the auspices, under the guise of inclusion, you're trying to get me kicked out of my house?
[01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.571]  That's, you need to buy a dictionary lady.
[01:13:15.571 --> 01:13:17.332]  That's not what inclusion means.
[01:13:17.332 --> 01:13:21.734]  It's okay if in a family of five, one of them likes Trump.
[01:13:21.734 --> 01:13:22.935]  And you know what my wife did?
[01:13:22.935 --> 01:13:25.397]  She went over to this woman's house with the kids.
[01:13:25.397 --> 01:13:29.959]  And my five-year-old was holding his teddy bear and my wife said, why are you terrorizing my family?
[01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:32.161]  Why do you want my children to be less safe?
[01:13:32.161 --> 01:13:33.782]  I get death threats all the time.
[01:13:33.782 --> 01:13:37.924]  When you bring my whole family into this, now they are part of the death threats.
[01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:42.047]  And the woman called the cops and said that I brought four people over to threaten her.
[01:13:42.688 --> 01:13:44.349]  Well, uh, no.
[01:13:44.349 --> 01:13:47.712]  The people you're talking about are little kids.
[01:13:47.712 --> 01:13:48.893]  Well, that's the next level.
[01:13:48.893 --> 01:13:52.876]  Everything they lie, the left has gone into psychotic lying.
[01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:53.997]  Like, it's ridiculous.
[01:13:53.997 --> 01:14:06.627]  Like, they'll be on the news and say white people are inherently evil, Don Lemon, and then say that Trump's a racist, or they'll say Trump hates Jews, and then the next program is how mean Israel is to Palestinians.
[01:14:06.627 --> 01:14:08.409]  None of it even matches up anymore.
[01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:09.569]  It's just craziness.
[01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.672]  That's why they hate debate.
[01:14:12.672 --> 01:14:13.893]  We're talk show hosts.
[01:14:13.893 --> 01:14:15.574]  I'm a talk show host.
[01:14:15.574 --> 01:14:18.216]  I would kill to get any of these people on my show.
[01:14:18.216 --> 01:14:22.920]  Getting a liberal on a conservative show is like trying to feed a squirrel in the park.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.122]  How does Tucker Carlson do it?
[01:14:25.122 --> 01:14:27.384]  It's like getting a little bird to land in your hand and feed him.
[01:14:27.384 --> 01:14:28.985]  How on earth is Tucker able to do it?
[01:14:28.985 --> 01:14:32.167]  Because that's pure gold for us and they won't do it.
[01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:33.368]  How does he do it?
[01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:34.029]  I asked him that.
[01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:37.354]  And he said it's very, very hard.
[01:14:37.354 --> 01:14:41.695]  Tucker has an entire team that are on the phones pleading.
[01:14:41.695 --> 01:14:43.396]  I assume they offer them money.
[01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:47.518]  And they say, you know, it'll be on your terms, you can hang up, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:47.518 --> 01:14:52.159]  I don't know exactly the wording they use, but they'll eventually... Because Tucker's a good debater.
[01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:54.980]  I mean, I wouldn't be afraid to debate him, but it would be a challenge.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.121]  And he has these idiots on, he just destroys them.
[01:14:58.206 --> 01:15:01.630]  Yeah, and I guess they're arrogant enough to think they're gonna beat him.
[01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:06.795]  I mean, he has that bald guy on again and again and again because that's the only guy that will talk to him.
[01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:09.377]  And he probably knows that guy from back in CNN days.
[01:15:09.377 --> 01:15:12.921]  But the left doesn't want to debate because they don't want truth.
[01:15:12.921 --> 01:15:13.502]  They don't want
[01:15:14.122 --> 01:15:14.683]  Harmony.
[01:15:14.683 --> 01:15:16.305]  They don't want unity.
[01:15:16.305 --> 01:15:22.573]  They want us to be ostracized so Trump is pushed out and they can regain the power.
[01:15:22.573 --> 01:15:24.215]  This isn't about coming together.
[01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:26.357]  This is socialist, communist mentality.
[01:15:26.357 --> 01:15:29.861]  It's about total control and shutting down opposition and creating a one-party dictatorship.
[01:15:30.422 --> 01:15:36.283]  Which might work in a few places where you like already had serfs and then this commies come in like Russia.
[01:15:36.283 --> 01:15:38.104]  It isn't going to work here.
[01:15:38.104 --> 01:15:44.365]  Don't they understand that it is going to cause the opposite reaction but don't interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves.
[01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:46.626]  I think it was Von Bismarck said that.
[01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:54.108]  We'll be right back with Gavin McGinnis to talk about the election, to talk about so many other big things and I'll play that Don Lemon clip straight ahead.
[01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:03.614]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.614 --> 01:16:06.656]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.656 --> 01:16:12.580]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.363]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:17.644]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.644 --> 01:16:18.985]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.985 --> 01:16:25.189]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:26.610]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:29.387 --> 01:17:30.187]  Not true.
[01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.028]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:32.028 --> 01:17:36.030]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[01:19:45.945 --> 01:19:47.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.195]  Strange days have found us.
[01:20:18.195 --> 01:20:18.935]  Strange days are here.
[01:20:18.935 --> 01:20:25.178]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.178 --> 01:20:38.984]  All right, Gavin McGinnis is here, and I said, hey, let's get into how they're banning hundreds of fan pages of yours on Facebook, saying the Proud Boys are basically a terrorist group when all they do is go out and defend people when Antifa attacks.
[01:20:38.984 --> 01:20:41.906]  And he has something interesting to say, and I get what he's saying, so I want him to repeat it.
[01:20:42.739 --> 01:20:50.962]  We don't want to move on, because once again, the Bligs, which is what I want to get into next, and the election, and what he thinks is going to happen, and, you know, just so many other issues.
[01:20:50.962 --> 01:20:58.344]  But, yeah, let's talk about what's happening with Proud Boys, because everywhere meth-head Antifa professors show up, attack them.
[01:20:58.344 --> 01:21:00.385]  It's just a group that you had an idea about.
[01:21:00.385 --> 01:21:02.086]  As you said, you don't lead it or run it.
[01:21:02.086 --> 01:21:03.306]  Nobody does, just an idea.
[01:21:03.306 --> 01:21:11.089]  And then now they're, you know, acting like you're basically a military general with a ninja army.
[01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:11.469]  I wish.
[01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.769]  Yeah, you know, I started Hipsters, too, in the early 2000s.
[01:21:15.769 --> 01:21:21.175]  I started the two biggest youth subcultures of the past quarter century.
[01:21:21.175 --> 01:21:27.584]  And it's just being a fun guy who believes in character and legacy and the truth.
[01:21:28.204 --> 01:21:30.586]  And in both cases, it was just fun stuff.
[01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.547]  But no, I'm not the leader of the Proud Boys.
[01:21:32.547 --> 01:21:38.490]  I'm just, I'm a talk show host who started a club a couple years ago, and it's just, it's on its own.
[01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:44.134]  It's a multi-racial, pro-gay, pro-Jewish club, just like any other men's club.
[01:21:44.854 --> 01:21:55.999]  And I think that the left is using this idea that I'm sort of this hate Nazi with this hate army that roams, they literally said in the New York Post, roams the streets.
[01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:56.599]  No!
[01:21:56.599 --> 01:21:58.880]  That is Antifa in a nutshell.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.401]  Antifa is not just a club.
[01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:04.963]  Antifa is tied to the DNC.
[01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:06.404]  They're tied to the state.
[01:22:06.404 --> 01:22:18.590]  So when they attack someone, they get the narrative from up top, and then the narrative is also pushed out by Governor Cuomo, by de Blasio, by the Attorney General.
[01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:19.271]  It's all the same.
[01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:22.512]  Like, you can buy Antifa shirts at Walmart.
[01:22:22.512 --> 01:22:25.394]  Don Lemon calls them anti-fascist.
[01:22:25.394 --> 01:22:26.774]  They are the state.
[01:22:26.774 --> 01:22:28.775]  The anarchists are the state now.
[01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:30.316]  They have become totally mainstream.
[01:22:30.376 --> 01:22:42.061]  The police in blue cities protect Antifa, so I think the Proud Boys are great, but as you said, you are credited with starting hipsterism, which turned into this monstrous leftist thing, you know, 15 years after.
[01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:48.284]  So you're just, I get what you say, you don't control Proud Boys, it's not your identity, it's just one more idea you had.
[01:22:48.284 --> 01:22:49.624]  Exactly.
[01:22:49.624 --> 01:22:53.426]  And I think they're a good example of the left's
[01:22:54.153 --> 01:22:56.595]  Propaganda, and how often they lie.
[01:22:56.595 --> 01:23:01.739]  I mean, they were recently, the news was talking about multi-racial white supremacy.
[01:23:01.739 --> 01:23:06.903]  And you go, you know, do you know when normal Americans read that, they think you're insane?
[01:23:06.903 --> 01:23:07.784]  I think it's the onion.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.703]  This is what I was saying, yeah, with walk away or, or Blexit.
[01:23:12.703 --> 01:23:15.324]  Like, I think we were talking earlier about power.
[01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.965]  It's all about seizing power.
[01:23:16.965 --> 01:23:26.191]  And I think blacks in California, after they got spanked on the bum bum by the DNC for not supporting gay marriage and Prop 8, and I think the blacks in California went,
[01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:27.372]  What the hell are you doing?
[01:23:27.372 --> 01:23:28.854]  Why are you chastising me?
[01:23:28.854 --> 01:23:31.076]  I'm a Christian and I voted against this.
[01:23:31.076 --> 01:23:32.377]  None of your business how I vote.
[01:23:32.377 --> 01:23:35.100]  And the left went, no, no, no, that's not what you're supposed to do.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.642]  That's not what I trained you to do.
[01:23:36.642 --> 01:23:40.065]  And I think Black America is finally going, wait a minute.
[01:23:40.065 --> 01:23:42.387]  You don't see me as a human being.
[01:23:42.387 --> 01:23:44.830]  You see me as a pet.
[01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:46.712]  You see me as a human vote.
[01:23:48.512 --> 01:23:50.213]  And it's not working out for me.
[01:23:50.213 --> 01:23:54.295]  The south side of Chicago, Baltimore, we're dying every day.
[01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.736]  And it's your policies.
[01:23:55.736 --> 01:23:56.556]  It's DNC.
[01:23:56.556 --> 01:24:00.678]  And then Joe Biden goes, I know it's bad, but they're going to have you in chains.
[01:24:00.678 --> 01:24:02.519]  And I think black America is finally going.
[01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:09.742]  That's exactly what libertarian Christian nationalist conservatives want is to put black people in chains because that'd be really good for everybody.
[01:24:09.742 --> 01:24:12.043]  What planet is this crap?
[01:24:12.043 --> 01:24:14.925]  Because I forget that Biden said that over and over again.
[01:24:15.385 --> 01:24:17.046]  Well, in fact, let's cue up Don Lemon.
[01:24:17.046 --> 01:24:18.287]  He's been saying this over and over again.
[01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:21.189]  So, whichever clip you've got, there's like three of them in the last three days.
[01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.470]  I haven't played any of them yet.
[01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:26.953]  There was another one this morning where he says, the number one threat is white men.
[01:24:26.953 --> 01:24:28.554]  They're the number one terror threat.
[01:24:28.554 --> 01:24:34.558]  And the New York Times has articles saying, we need to extinct the white people, written by white people.
[01:24:34.558 --> 01:24:41.283]  And it's like, they're literally trying like, like treating like blacks, Hispanics and Asians, like they're retarded baby ducks.
[01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:48.748]  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized right up to the
[01:25:08.848 --> 01:25:10.749]  Because there's three of these clips, and I hadn't watched them.
[01:25:10.749 --> 01:25:12.469]  Okay, this is the one I hadn't seen.
[01:25:12.469 --> 01:25:17.852]  He just said, we need to stop killing people, let's murder everyone.
[01:25:17.852 --> 01:25:20.553]  Or two plus two equals four, but it equals a thousand.
[01:25:20.553 --> 01:25:25.255]  He just said we need to stop demonizing people, and whites are inherently evil, and are terrorists.
[01:25:25.255 --> 01:25:25.775]  Start it over!
[01:25:26.977 --> 01:25:38.440]  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized up to the right.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.320]  And we have to start doing something about them.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.501]  There is no travel ban on them.
[01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:45.882]  There is no ban on, you know, the Muslim ban.
[01:25:45.882 --> 01:25:47.722]  There is no white guy ban.
[01:25:47.722 --> 01:25:50.803]  So what do we do about that?
[01:25:50.803 --> 01:25:53.704]  Gavin, you take it first.
[01:25:53.704 --> 01:25:53.944]  Okay.
[01:25:54.716 --> 01:26:00.239]  If you look at all the crime in Japan, it's pretty much exclusively Japanese people.
[01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:04.082]  Japan has a real problem with Japanese men.
[01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:07.364]  They are making up almost all of the crime in Japan.
[01:26:07.364 --> 01:26:10.806]  What are we going to do, Japan, about your Japanese problem?
[01:26:10.806 --> 01:26:15.548]  I mean, again, if you're a high school teacher and you get that and you go, hey, Don, can you come over here?
[01:26:15.548 --> 01:26:17.890]  I just I could not but notice you said don't
[01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:19.411]  Judge people.
[01:26:19.411 --> 01:26:20.372]  Don't be divisive.
[01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:21.733]  Don't demonize people.
[01:26:21.733 --> 01:26:26.677]  And then in this next sentence, you demonize the vast majority of the country.
[01:26:26.677 --> 01:26:27.838]  I don't understand.
[01:26:27.838 --> 01:26:31.641]  Even though white men have the lowest crime rate after Asians.
[01:26:31.641 --> 01:26:35.685]  So we have the second lowest crime rate, but now we are the worst people.
[01:26:36.843 --> 01:26:42.544]  You know, the beauty of libertarianism and paleoconservatism is, it doesn't get into race.
[01:26:42.544 --> 01:26:49.726]  It just says, meritocracy, you're good at this job, you've got to sit there and meddle and identify everyone by their race.
[01:26:49.726 --> 01:26:53.247]  You just say, we have a crime problem in this country, let's fix it.
[01:26:53.247 --> 01:26:57.308]  We have a problem, there's a shooting problem in this country, let's fix it.
[01:26:57.308 --> 01:26:59.868]  But no, he has to say, I've noticed they're all white men.
[01:26:59.868 --> 01:27:01.529]  Yeah, America is 75% white.
[01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:06.395]  Crime is probably 80% male.
[01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:09.761]  You're gonna get some of the Venn diagram going on there, Don.
[01:27:09.761 --> 01:27:11.745]  But the idea that...
[01:27:13.717 --> 01:27:16.778]  Because of the crime rate, the Democratic run cities and all of it.
[01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:19.859]  Blacks are 10 times more likely on average to commit a crime against whites and vice versa.
[01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:21.400]  We don't say blacks are all criminals.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.501]  There's still a very small minority, just like it's a very small minority of white males committing crime.
[01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:29.402]  But the idea to say white men are bad, let's restrict their movements.
[01:27:29.402 --> 01:27:39.506]  If there was a country of caveman like white people with no visas where they killed everybody and sold people on sex slavery, I would say you can't get on airplanes and fly here without a valid visa.
[01:27:39.506 --> 01:27:40.906]  That's all Trump said.
[01:27:40.906 --> 01:27:42.587]  You can't fly here from Somalia.
[01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:49.514]  It was perfectly reasonable, and the list that he came up with was an Obama list.
[01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:56.019]  But again, you know, we always make this mistake, you and I. We put our brains into their heads, and we say, don't you want to get to the truth?
[01:27:56.019 --> 01:27:59.261]  And you realize, that's not what's going on here.
[01:27:59.261 --> 01:28:00.882]  This has nothing to do with truth.
[01:28:00.882 --> 01:28:02.083]  Don Lemon, right there,
[01:28:02.723 --> 01:28:04.144]  Didn't even believe what he was saying.
[01:28:04.144 --> 01:28:12.210]  What he was really trying to say is Trump supporters kill people and Trump can't be re-elected or more people will die.
[01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:18.013]  So vote DNC, vote Beto or whoever we run against Trump or you'll be killed.
[01:28:18.013 --> 01:28:27.140]  Even though this weird loner hated Trump and thought Trump was a globalist, but he hated Israel, the globalists want to get rid of Israel.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.482]  So the dumb truck driver doesn't even know what he's talking about.
[01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:35.170]  He's not just a dumb truck driver, he's a... you-know-what-hole.
[01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:36.552]  And an idiot.
[01:28:36.552 --> 01:28:42.237]  Didn't Benjamin Netanyahu's son tweet out a meme that was mocking George Soros?
[01:28:42.237 --> 01:28:44.459]  I think he got in trouble for doing that.
[01:28:44.459 --> 01:28:48.102]  But George Soros is an atheist.
[01:28:48.102 --> 01:28:50.144]  His father was an atheist.
[01:28:50.144 --> 01:28:52.386]  The guy doesn't embrace Judaism.
[01:28:52.386 --> 01:28:54.328]  No, he wants to overthrow Israel.
[01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:54.888]  It's incredible.
[01:28:54.888 --> 01:28:56.650]  We'll be right back with Gavin McGinnis on Alex Jones.
[01:28:57.432 --> 01:29:01.277]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[01:29:01.277 --> 01:29:04.962]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year.

[01:29:54.817 --> 01:30:03.981]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:30:05.686 --> 01:30:08.829]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:30:08.829 --> 01:30:11.492]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:30:11.492 --> 01:30:15.796]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:30:15.796 --> 01:30:23.284]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:25.707]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:30:29.142 --> 01:30:31.344]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:30:31.344 --> 01:30:34.387]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:46.317]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:30:46.317 --> 01:30:47.878]  It's the David Knight Show!

[01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:17.473]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.473 --> 01:33:20.256]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.256 --> 01:33:22.859]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.859 --> 01:33:24.541]  You want answers?
[01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:25.983]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:25.983 --> 01:33:28.185]  He's Gavin McInnes!
[01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:29.967]  Get off my lawn!
[01:33:29.967 --> 01:33:31.509]  CRTV!
[01:33:31.509 --> 01:33:32.590]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:36.264 --> 01:33:38.906]  Alright, I'm sick of Russiagate, but there's big developments in it.
[01:33:38.906 --> 01:33:42.849]  Roger Stone joins us for one segment, coming up next segment.
[01:33:42.849 --> 01:33:44.230]  Then we're going to open the phones up.
[01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:46.272]  We've got Owen Schroyer in studio.
[01:33:46.272 --> 01:33:48.914]  But I wanted to finish up with Gab McGinnis, who's one of my favorite guests.
[01:33:48.914 --> 01:33:51.076]  I love his show, and I am a CRTV subscriber.
[01:33:51.076 --> 01:34:01.964]  Because it's good, funny, smart television that I can even sit around and have as ambient in the background, and I don't have to see the constant catheter ads and silver ads like Fox.
[01:34:01.964 --> 01:34:04.627]  I'm not knocking it, but my God, I see one more
[01:34:05.327 --> 01:34:06.108]  My pillow, Adam.
[01:34:06.108 --> 01:34:07.869]  I'm going to jump out of a window here.
[01:34:07.869 --> 01:34:09.910]  So that's what we watch at night, CRTV.
[01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:12.932]  And of course, you support InfoWars, folks.
[01:34:12.932 --> 01:34:14.453]  We appreciate you all.
[01:34:14.453 --> 01:34:16.835]  We had that big sale that just ended, but now we have our new X3.
[01:34:16.835 --> 01:34:18.556]  It's an incredible product.
[01:34:18.556 --> 01:34:19.136]  50% off.
[01:34:19.136 --> 01:34:21.598]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com and free shipping on that.
[01:34:21.598 --> 01:34:21.978]  Check it out.
[01:34:21.978 --> 01:34:22.499]  It's amazing.
[01:34:22.499 --> 01:34:23.759]  X3 is very exciting.
[01:34:23.759 --> 01:34:27.102]  But I'm going to belabor that after he leaves us.
[01:34:27.102 --> 01:34:27.362]  Gavin.
[01:34:28.888 --> 01:34:30.748]  I'm a pro-militia guy.
[01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:32.649]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:34:32.649 --> 01:34:39.190]  And every able-bodied man, 18 to 45, has a duty and a right to be armed and trained, like Switzerland.
[01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:45.631]  But I can really see a false flag here, and these militias are infiltrated a lot of them by the Feds, that's a fact.
[01:34:45.631 --> 01:34:48.372]  And usually it's the Fed in a militia that tells you, that's not true!
[01:34:48.372 --> 01:34:49.652]  Jones is the Fed!
[01:34:49.652 --> 01:34:50.513]  There are no Feds!
[01:34:50.513 --> 01:34:53.193]  Now let's go blow up a federal building together!
[01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:57.334]  So, and that's usually an FBI informant or FBI, as we've seen, and the leftist arm of it.
[01:34:58.547 --> 01:35:07.133]  Someone like Reality Winner is trying to set people up, but we've got the Border Patrol warned Texans about malicious stopping migrant caravan.
[01:35:07.133 --> 01:35:11.597]  We've got way more than just the 5,000 troops that Trump talked about.
[01:35:11.597 --> 01:35:16.741]  We've got video that's on drugreport.com of Army tanks being sent down there, Abrams tanks.
[01:35:17.761 --> 01:35:19.683]  Command vehicles, all of it.
[01:35:19.683 --> 01:35:21.885]  So I think Trump's got this handled.
[01:35:21.885 --> 01:35:30.233]  People have a right to go down there, but I'm just saying, I smell a big fat chance for some leftist group to shoot some, you know, kids or something.
[01:35:30.233 --> 01:35:33.877]  Because, you know, nobody's really shot any migrant kids other than Mexican coyotes.
[01:35:35.006 --> 01:35:39.649]  But in the movie Machete, you know, Don Johnson does, so it must be real.
[01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:46.294]  I really see this as their last false flag and now they're busing them up days before the election to the Texas border.
[01:35:46.294 --> 01:35:47.715]  I really am concerned, Gavin McGinnis.
[01:35:49.158 --> 01:35:54.300]  Yeah, I've even been talking to liberals here in New York City, and they don't seem to like this.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.181]  They smell a rat.
[01:35:56.181 --> 01:36:11.086]  And it just seems very curious that thousands of people spontaneously rent some 18-wheelers together, I guess they all pool their money, and they drive and then walk for the cameras, and then drive and then walk for the cameras, on their way to Mexico.
[01:36:11.086 --> 01:36:16.088]  I mean, even the left is saying, this really looks like it's for optics, and if it is,
[01:36:16.708 --> 01:36:17.929]  Just for optics.
[01:36:17.929 --> 01:36:24.373]  That is brutally sinister and it shows how, I don't know, how evil some of these people on the left can be.
[01:36:24.373 --> 01:36:34.039]  Because are you trying to set up a scenario where hundreds of migrants are pushing the fences and they get crushed and maybe there's a photo of a dead kid or something?
[01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:39.642]  Or a military guy shooting at people who are trying to, you know, mob him or something?
[01:36:39.642 --> 01:36:45.126]  Are you trying to get some picture to change the election and happily sacrificing hundreds of people?
[01:36:45.846 --> 01:36:49.009]  Well, I mean, you're going to put Satan out of work.
[01:36:49.009 --> 01:36:54.295]  I think you're asking the question, is grass green against the sky blue?
[01:36:54.295 --> 01:36:56.597]  The bear is crapping the woods.
[01:36:56.597 --> 01:36:58.819]  Soros admittedly is funding this.
[01:36:58.819 --> 01:37:01.102]  The UN is being funded by the State Department.
[01:37:01.102 --> 01:37:03.164]  Lou Dobbs talks about it and almost gets fired.
[01:37:03.164 --> 01:37:06.047]  His guest judicial watch that has the documents gets banned.
[01:37:07.316 --> 01:37:09.741]  Because it's on record they're shipping these people up.
[01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:20.320]  I have local newscasts showing buses from years ago and currently where they say the UN runs the program and Obama brings them in and as soon as Trump got in he ended it.
[01:37:22.852 --> 01:37:26.575]  You know what this reminds me of is Fast and Furious, which isn't controversial.
[01:37:26.575 --> 01:37:37.302]  Everyone knows that, what was it, Eric Holder and Obama were caught sending guns down to Mexico so they could make guns look bad, get them in the hands of cartels, and they'll go, look at all these AKs, they killed tons of people.
[01:37:37.822 --> 01:37:45.066]  I mean, no matter how bad the right gets, you never hear about them wanting to use human beings as fodder.
[01:37:45.066 --> 01:37:51.269]  We're talking earlier about Blexit, where they want to use black people as human votes and they use illegals as voters too.
[01:37:51.269 --> 01:37:56.973]  And now we have Fast and Furious and these caravans, where they're happily risking lives for optics.
[01:37:56.973 --> 01:37:57.493]  I mean, this is...
[01:37:58.095 --> 01:37:59.536]  Stalin in a nutshell.
[01:37:59.536 --> 01:38:02.798]  This is his mass starvations and mass murder.
[01:38:02.798 --> 01:38:04.279]  This is the way communists think.
[01:38:04.279 --> 01:38:05.899]  They don't think about human beings.
[01:38:05.899 --> 01:38:08.961]  They see humans as just sort of like ephemera.
[01:38:08.961 --> 01:38:13.464]  Just a big pile of wasps they can send somewhere.
[01:38:13.464 --> 01:38:15.385]  Or a dam they can blow and have it just flood.
[01:38:17.204 --> 01:38:18.125]  And the UN admits that.
[01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:28.935]  They say they want to destroy borders, collapse the evil capitalist system, so we'll accept the socialist utopia with rich people like Soros and the Chai Khans tax-exempt living in palaces.
[01:38:30.253 --> 01:38:31.574]  Dismantle capitalism.
[01:38:31.574 --> 01:38:37.697]  You know, when I was a young man in the 80s, that was what the crazy, radical nuts said, and it was kind of cool.
[01:38:37.697 --> 01:38:39.537]  Like, oh, this guy's a communist.
[01:38:39.537 --> 01:38:41.859]  That's kind of a freaky thing.
[01:38:41.859 --> 01:38:42.859]  Now it's mainstream.
[01:38:42.859 --> 01:38:48.722]  I think something like more than 50% of people in the DNC would prefer socialism.
[01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:53.164]  It's 50 plus percent of millennials want communism or socialism.
[01:38:54.164 --> 01:38:56.425]  And they always use Northern Europe as an example.
[01:38:56.425 --> 01:38:59.286]  Northern Europe made its money when it was free market.
[01:38:59.286 --> 01:39:02.288]  It is now literally spending its parents' money.
[01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:03.628]  It's going bankrupt.
[01:39:03.628 --> 01:39:04.629]  Fully plummeting.
[01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:07.610]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:18.215]  How could they grab victory from the jaws of defeat, A, and then B, what are they going to do if they fail, which it looks like they are all across the world.
[01:39:18.215 --> 01:39:19.535]  People are waking up.
[01:39:19.535 --> 01:39:20.596]  They're being thrown out of office.
[01:39:20.596 --> 01:39:21.316]  What are they going to do?
[01:39:23.211 --> 01:39:24.472]  They're going to continue this.
[01:39:24.472 --> 01:39:30.458]  I mean, it is ramping up exponentially, but it is the same thing that we talked about last time I was on your show.
[01:39:30.458 --> 01:39:32.240]  It's the same process.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.603]  First, you dehumanize someone by making them a Nazi.
[01:39:35.603 --> 01:39:40.488]  Then, you ostracize them at their work, get them fired, get them separated from their family.
[01:39:40.488 --> 01:39:41.409]  You isolate them.
[01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.530]  And then you kill them.
[01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:44.971]  Then they're dead.
[01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:45.492]  Then they're fine.
[01:39:45.492 --> 01:39:47.333]  You basically starve them to death.
[01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:50.035]  So you isolate, vilify, ostracize.
[01:39:50.035 --> 01:39:51.696]  And that's what they're going to keep doing.
[01:39:51.696 --> 01:39:56.600]  And the crazy part is their appetite involves half the country.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.102]  It's not like they want to get a couple of weirdos.
[01:39:59.102 --> 01:40:02.084]  They don't want to get like a David Duke and a Richard Spencer.
[01:40:02.084 --> 01:40:04.106]  The actual bonafide alt-right guys.
[01:40:04.466 --> 01:40:09.547]  No, they want everyone who supports Trump to be seen as a Nazi on the far, far right.
[01:40:09.547 --> 01:40:16.289]  The term far right is just thrown around at every conservative right now, and I don't even know what it means!
[01:40:16.289 --> 01:40:17.289]  How do we push back?
[01:40:17.289 --> 01:40:21.610]  Because I instinctively don't get people into brigades to go get people banned.
[01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:30.873]  I instinctively don't try to take Brian Stelter off the air, even though, in my view, he is a criminal working with groups to racketeer to shut me off the air and admitting it.
[01:40:30.873 --> 01:40:31.613]  He's a horrible
[01:40:32.273 --> 01:40:37.197]  Just a sickening, penguin-esque, villainous creature.
[01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:40.559]  Right out of Batman novels.
[01:40:40.559 --> 01:40:43.242]  But at a certain point, they're assaulting me.
[01:40:43.242 --> 01:40:44.302]  They're stalking me.
[01:40:44.302 --> 01:40:48.866]  They have their reporters driving around the building with blacked out windows.
[01:40:48.866 --> 01:40:51.248]  He's literally trying to destroy me.
[01:40:51.248 --> 01:41:00.375]  And at a certain point, what do I do to a villain, an anti-American criminal, that is trying to foment violent revolution and destroy my family?
[01:41:01.325 --> 01:41:06.048]  You stand up for yourself in a microcosm and in a macrocosm.
[01:41:06.048 --> 01:41:12.931]  In the big picture, you continue to do your show and you tell the truth and you talk to people and you get guests on your show and you try to expose the truth.
[01:41:12.931 --> 01:41:19.155]  And in the small, when someone confronts you, you don't cower, you don't walk out of the restaurant, you know, shuddering.
[01:41:19.155 --> 01:41:21.376]  Remember that guy from Subway, Jared, what's his name?
[01:41:22.937 --> 01:41:25.098]  He was accused of pedophilia.
[01:41:25.098 --> 01:41:27.499]  He cowered because he was guilty.
[01:41:27.499 --> 01:41:29.580]  And then he did a plea deal, and now he's in jail.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.081]  Guilty people cower.
[01:41:31.081 --> 01:41:33.262]  Guilty people apologize.
[01:41:33.262 --> 01:41:37.624]  If you're not guilty, you're not a Nazi, you're not spreading hate, you say, what are you talking about?
[01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:38.124]  No, I agree.
[01:41:38.124 --> 01:41:48.730]  And then I try to speak out against it, and they try to block me everywhere, so they can cowardly tie me up, like in a gladiatory arena, and then they walk out while I'm tied up, or you're tied up, and stab us.
[01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:50.230]  But see, the crowd doesn't like that.
[01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.191]  They're booing them.
[01:41:51.631 --> 01:41:52.231]  I was in DC last weekend.
[01:42:09.045 --> 01:42:10.646]  Blexit was massive.
[01:42:10.646 --> 01:42:12.707]  They filled the streets.
[01:42:12.707 --> 01:42:19.410]  400 black men went to, and black women, went to the White House wearing MAGA hats, chanting USA.
[01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:25.053]  They were shoulder-to-shoulder, crammed into the Oval Office, screaming USA, USA.
[01:42:25.053 --> 01:42:27.254]  Not a peep in the media.
[01:42:27.254 --> 01:42:29.715]  WalkAway was the same weekend.
[01:42:29.715 --> 01:42:31.736]  It was all so huge.
[01:42:31.736 --> 01:42:32.976]  Hundreds of people.
[01:42:32.976 --> 01:42:33.717]  Liberals.
[01:42:33.717 --> 01:42:34.437]  I spoke to them.
[01:42:34.437 --> 01:42:36.098]  I did a show with many of them.
[01:42:36.098 --> 01:42:37.859]  And a lot of them were just saying,
[01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:40.791]  And that's why they're so scared.
[01:42:40.791 --> 01:42:42.332]  That's why they're trying to censor.
[01:42:42.332 --> 01:42:44.874]  CRTV.com, InfoWars.com.

[01:43:57.256 --> 01:44:01.201]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:04.484]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.484 --> 01:44:10.771]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.771 --> 01:44:13.534]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.275 --> 01:44:18.099]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.099 --> 01:44:24.566]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.566 --> 01:44:29.531]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.273 --> 01:44:34.195]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.195 --> 01:44:41.398]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.398 --> 01:44:46.600]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:52.302]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.302 --> 01:44:56.284]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.527 --> 01:45:00.848]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:45:56.485 --> 01:46:01.506]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:46:01.506 --> 01:46:04.447]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.447 --> 01:46:07.407]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.481]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.099 --> 01:47:14.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:19.983]  You wanna sabotage America?
[01:47:19.983 --> 01:47:23.585]  We're gonna sabotage you!
[01:47:23.585 --> 01:47:30.468]  And now the more they oppress us, the more they censor us, the more the sleeping giant awakens!
[01:47:32.316 --> 01:47:39.580]  I've got to tell you, I've told Rodri, co-host with Owen Schroeder, every day, 3 to 5 in the war room, we know you're innocent.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:41.561]  I was there, I remember.
[01:47:41.561 --> 01:47:43.442]  Everyone was trying to get Julian Assange on.
[01:47:43.442 --> 01:47:46.363]  WikiLeaks said that it was going to expose the Clintons.
[01:47:46.363 --> 01:47:47.604]  They hyped it up.
[01:47:47.604 --> 01:47:54.087]  I was mad they were going on CNN and NPR where they were being attacked and I was like calling Assange's names.
[01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:58.664]  I was talking and you're like, well, I got a back channel and talk show host that knows him.
[01:47:58.664 --> 01:48:04.829]  And I hear, you know, and then they turn that into everybody talked to Julian Assange, but us.
[01:48:04.829 --> 01:48:06.571]  And I was like, we've been a supporter of his.
[01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:07.932]  Why won't he talk to us?
[01:48:07.932 --> 01:48:08.993]  Well, we're in full war.
[01:48:08.993 --> 01:48:11.034]  You know, we don't have credibility.
[01:48:11.034 --> 01:48:14.457]  No, the truth is you get attacked when you come on here.
[01:48:14.457 --> 01:48:18.000]  But now they've gone into, oh, he's really secretly subpoenaed the president.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.922]  Oh, they're about to get stoned any day now.
[01:48:21.064 --> 01:48:21.584]  Every channel.
[01:48:21.584 --> 01:48:23.565]  So I'm going to ask you what's afoot here in a moment.
[01:48:23.565 --> 01:48:29.747]  First off, because we're six days out, I'm not spending a lot of time plugging products.
[01:48:29.747 --> 01:48:38.329]  But you know, going back a few years ago, the oil companies that get the deep earth pure iodine, the good halogen crystals between 7 and 12,000 feet, began to charge me more.
[01:48:38.329 --> 01:48:39.150]  It was hard to get it.
[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.810]  We had supply problems.
[01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:49.673]  I tried to find another distributor because you got to go through the DEA licensed groups to get pure iodine because it's a precursor to things that are illegal once we put it out in the
[01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:53.972]  And the glycerin oil and the rest of it, it's totally legal and lawful.
[01:48:53.972 --> 01:48:55.954]  You have to go through a big process.
[01:48:55.954 --> 01:49:03.340]  And so I kind of got put over a barrel where I was going to have to raise the price of it, really astronomically, to even be able to then fund ourselves.
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:15.930]  Well, we did a lot of research, worked with some top labs in the country, and they said, why aren't you adding a little bit of the two other types of iodine in there, and a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize, that way it lasts longer and it's even better.
[01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:17.332]  And so that's what we've done.
[01:49:18.482 --> 01:49:28.566]  The new Survival Shield X3 is an energized atomic state with new nascent tri-iodine formula.
[01:49:28.566 --> 01:49:30.287]  It's an energized atomic state.
[01:49:30.287 --> 01:49:32.808]  It means it's on.
[01:49:32.808 --> 01:49:34.169]  It's pure.
[01:49:34.169 --> 01:49:38.411]  A whopping 1,100 micrograms of nascent tri-iodine per dropper.
[01:49:38.411 --> 01:49:39.111]  Serving.
[01:49:39.111 --> 01:49:40.492]  So it's a perfect number that it's X3.
[01:49:40.492 --> 01:49:43.233]  So that would be three times five out of all three types.
[01:49:43.233 --> 01:49:45.914]  Like no other product out there, this is a state-of-the-art iodine supplement.
[01:49:47.062 --> 01:49:48.723]  Three is better than one, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:48.723 --> 01:49:57.847]  We found out how to capture and stabilize three nascent iodine atoms with top chemists and developers bound together to form a larger and more powerful iodine.
[01:49:57.847 --> 01:50:04.290]  I guarantee in a year or two that everyone else will be trying to copy our X3 nascent triiodine formula.
[01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:06.951]  But we launched iodine nationwide to be so popular now.
[01:50:06.951 --> 01:50:09.653]  And they're imitations on retail shelves just like they do with X2.
[01:50:11.448 --> 01:50:15.252]  So it's available in 2 oz, double the size, and 1 oz.
[01:50:15.252 --> 01:50:16.773]  And it is amazing.
[01:50:16.773 --> 01:50:18.975]  We still have some X2 final run of that.
[01:50:18.975 --> 01:50:19.756]  It's excellent as well.
[01:50:19.756 --> 01:50:22.258]  It's the pure Deep Earth Crystal type.
[01:50:22.258 --> 01:50:23.940]  This is mainly Deep Earth Crystal.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:27.803]  And the other two different types of iodine with it, it does a better absorption.
[01:50:27.803 --> 01:50:30.866]  Some people can't absorb even the trunate, so they need the other type.
[01:50:30.866 --> 01:50:33.008]  So this is the new level.
[01:50:33.008 --> 01:50:36.191]  And we could have made it pure Deep Earth Crystal.
[01:50:37.472 --> 01:50:40.954]  But then getting into all the chemistry and all of it, this is the next level.
[01:50:40.954 --> 01:50:46.558]  In fact, if people turn out to like X2 better, we'll just put out X2 Original, and it'll just be that type.
[01:50:46.558 --> 01:50:48.319]  But this is better.
[01:50:48.319 --> 01:50:52.881]  They're both excellent, and it's all apples and oranges for your different physiology and your metabolic systems.
[01:50:52.881 --> 01:50:53.962]  Consult your physician.
[01:50:53.962 --> 01:50:58.705]  The point is, InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:58.705 --> 01:51:05.109]  And I'm gonna have myself a nice, delicious dropper right now of X3.
[01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:06.890]  A lot of folks just take it under the tongue.
[01:51:07.734 --> 01:51:10.155]  You take the stuff you buy at the store, it'll rot a hole in your gut and kill you.
[01:51:10.155 --> 01:51:15.097]  This is good, healthy, delicious, real iodine, not bound, industrial crap.
[01:51:15.097 --> 01:51:17.158]  So there it is, ladies and gentlemen, and you just drink it.
[01:51:17.158 --> 01:51:21.260]  Mmm.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.080]  Amazing.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.183]  Energy, libido, stamina, weight loss, for me, I mean, it's just the missing link.
[01:51:27.183 --> 01:51:29.424]  Roger Stone, I don't know where to start.
[01:51:29.424 --> 01:51:29.824]  You are
[01:51:31.072 --> 01:51:35.155]  The biggest guy in the media right now, just, you are Satan.
[01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:39.198]  You are, as Stephen Colbert said, Trump is Putin's cock holster.
[01:51:39.198 --> 01:51:42.280]  Hate to use a term like that, but that's on national TV about our president.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.502]  So for documentary reasons, I'm saying it.
[01:51:44.502 --> 01:51:46.223]  I mean, I've been on the inside of this.
[01:51:46.223 --> 01:51:49.405]  It is complete BS.
[01:51:49.405 --> 01:51:50.806]  I know I'm under investigation.
[01:51:50.806 --> 01:51:51.767]  This is just insane.
[01:51:53.868 --> 01:51:55.650]  Payment processors are like, we're dropping you.
[01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:57.492]  You're under investigation by Mueller.
[01:51:57.492 --> 01:51:58.693]  We've had the FBI calling.
[01:51:58.693 --> 01:52:07.402]  So that's the level of harassment we're all under by this terrorist, Robert Mueller, who the left believes is God on Earth.
[01:52:07.402 --> 01:52:08.282]  So what is the latest?
[01:52:08.282 --> 01:52:09.384]  Because you are all over the news.
[01:52:09.864 --> 01:52:16.528]  And they always recycle the same bull about, well, he was on conference calls and said WikiLeaks will probably release it soon.
[01:52:16.528 --> 01:52:22.791]  Because they said it on the overnight show where I attacked Assange and said he was Hillary's butt plug.
[01:52:22.791 --> 01:52:25.032]  Because he did not release it.
[01:52:25.032 --> 01:52:26.093]  He said he would.
[01:52:26.093 --> 01:52:32.556]  They turned that like, Stone says they're going to release it later because Assange said so on television.
[01:52:32.556 --> 01:52:34.137]  This is just incredible, Roger.
[01:52:35.509 --> 01:52:36.810]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:40.334]  It's a feeding frenzy of fake news.
[01:52:40.334 --> 01:52:50.824]  On October 2nd, when Assange did not release any data, he did announce a schedule of releases, one a week for the next six weeks, going beyond the election.
[01:52:51.994 --> 01:52:56.876]  I imparted that to Steve Bannon in an email, public information.
[01:52:56.876 --> 01:53:04.378]  But some are trying to say that this implies communication directly with Assange or WikiLeaks, which of course is false.
[01:53:04.378 --> 01:53:11.940]  And as you just pointed out on the air there, I've now taken two polygraph exams to prove that this is all BS.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:19.583]  I think what they're trying to do, Alex, is inflate the whole Russian collusion narrative again ahead of the election.
[01:53:20.303 --> 01:53:32.708]  But there is still no evidence whatsoever that I did anything illegal or improper or had any communications or advance notice of the content or source of the WikiLeaks disclosures.
[01:53:32.708 --> 01:53:35.909]  By the way, I'm showing Zero Hedge at the time, 10, 13, 16, two years ago.
[01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:41.993]  Yeah, there's a Politico story that is posted hours before my email exchange with Steve Bannon.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:10.903]  Uh, that says that, uh, that Assange has announced a schedule of releases going forward.
[01:54:10.903 --> 01:54:12.284]  So it's a witch hunt.
[01:54:12.284 --> 01:54:23.950]  Um, uh, I think the special counsel still has no evidence of wrongdoing on my part, and they are, seem to be casting a wide net, but there is, uh, no, uh, witness.
[01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:29.253]  We're going to get to that in the next segment, but let me just back up here because I should have opened the interview with this.
[01:54:29.253 --> 01:54:30.013]  We talked this morning.
[01:54:31.644 --> 01:54:40.472]  You, it's ABC News, you passed two polygraphs, not some secret polygraph like bug-eyed CIA operative, you know, did in the Kavanaugh witch hunt.
[01:54:40.472 --> 01:54:45.757]  Two top famous people tested you, said you were truthful, that you did not have prior knowledge or weren't in contact with the songs.
[01:54:45.757 --> 01:54:46.898]  That's ABC News.
[01:54:46.898 --> 01:54:47.939]  We'll show that.
[01:54:47.939 --> 01:54:52.464]  And the other big bombshell, the disgraced Steve Bannon, who can't get ten people to his events.
[01:54:54.145 --> 01:55:06.182]  I've even learned he's digging around in my business and at the same time he is talking to Mueller and trying to act like he's got evidence on you.
[01:55:06.182 --> 01:55:07.404]  So this is outrageous.
[01:55:07.404 --> 01:55:08.085]  Let's talk about that.
[01:55:09.079 --> 01:55:15.062]  Yeah, the Washington Post yesterday reported that Bannon testified yesterday for the grand jury.
[01:55:15.062 --> 01:55:23.886]  Today, he appears to have leaked an email in which the day after Assange made no announcements, I told him it was out of security concerns.
[01:55:23.886 --> 01:55:26.347]  That was what I learned from Randy Credico.
[01:55:26.347 --> 01:55:34.591]  I wrote that on Stone Cold Truth on March 9th of 2018, and that he announced a schedule of future releases.
[01:55:34.591 --> 01:55:36.031]  This was not a secret.
[01:55:36.031 --> 01:55:37.672]  It was public information.
[01:55:38.532 --> 01:55:42.534]  This is a, it's a witch hunt, and it is outrageous.
[01:55:42.534 --> 01:55:52.980]  You, Alex, remember it well, because you were, like many commentators, both shocked and furious that Assange released nothing in his October 1st.
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:56:00.224]  And I remember talking to you, and it was also in the news, that Assange told everybody around him, I've been getting threatened, I need a few weeks to figure out what I'm going to do.
[01:56:00.224 --> 01:56:04.606]  Everyone was like attack dogs, or hunting dogs, you know, chasing a fox.
[01:56:06.447 --> 01:56:09.348]  A bunch of foxhounds wanting to get the WikiLeaks.
[01:56:09.348 --> 01:56:11.089]  And this is all part of the record.
[01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:15.431]  This is insane that they're trying to pin this on you and me.
[01:56:15.431 --> 01:56:17.811]  And let me be a little bit selfish here.
[01:56:17.811 --> 01:56:20.212]  You and others tell me they just are obsessing over me.
[01:56:20.212 --> 01:56:20.572]  What?
[01:56:20.572 --> 01:56:21.833]  I mean, that is crazy.
[01:56:22.796 --> 01:56:33.803]  Well, last night on MSNBC, Ari Melber brought you up twice and pointed out discussions you and I had on the air regarding Assange.
[01:56:33.803 --> 01:56:36.165]  None of this proves direct contact with him.
[01:56:36.165 --> 01:56:39.988]  We never had any direct contact with him, neither one of us.
[01:56:39.988 --> 01:56:47.673]  And I made that clear under oath before the House Intelligence Committee, which where, by the way, my testimony is 100% truthful and correct.
[01:56:49.834 --> 01:56:55.837]  And certain partisans who say otherwise are of course hiding behind their congressional immunity lawsuit.
[01:56:55.837 --> 01:57:01.319]  Roger, I know your wife got really angry the last time I said this, but she's a tough lady and her dad was anti-communist, Cuba, all that nine yards.
[01:57:01.319 --> 01:57:04.221]  She's a great lady, a beautiful lady as well.
[01:57:04.221 --> 01:57:06.602]  But she's not stupid, so we need to say this on air.
[01:57:07.728 --> 01:57:16.001]  They don't have a lot of moves, brother, and I think it's sleep with the fishes, Mr. Stone, and other people, not just you.
[01:57:16.001 --> 01:57:18.885]  I don't see them ever playing this hand properly.
[01:57:18.885 --> 01:57:20.969]  I think you need to up your security, buddy.
[01:57:22.569 --> 01:57:28.554]  Well, if the decision to bring charges against me is based on truth and evidence and facts, then nothing will happen.
[01:57:28.554 --> 01:57:29.274]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:57:29.274 --> 01:57:43.885]  They're going to want to kill you, as they've already tried twice, and then just convict you in the press, because this is too embarrassing to that knuckle-dragging, deep-state-loving slimebag, Robert Mueller, who looks like a hairless buzzard.
[01:57:43.885 --> 01:57:46.367]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone, Owen Schroer, and more.
[01:57:47.466 --> 01:57:55.855]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.855 --> 01:57:57.317]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.317 --> 01:58:02.022]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:02.022 --> 01:58:07.028]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.248 --> 01:58:27.397]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.897 --> 01:58:31.901]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:58:31.901 --> 01:58:35.564]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:35.564 --> 01:58:40.569]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.569 --> 01:58:43.311]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.311 --> 01:58:46.174]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:46.174 --> 01:58:54.061]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:58:55.754 --> 01:58:58.877]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:58:58.877 --> 01:59:01.559]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:59:01.559 --> 01:59:05.863]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:59:05.863 --> 01:59:13.370]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:15.772]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:21.412]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:59:21.412 --> 01:59:22.453]  They called it U.N.
[01:59:22.453 --> 01:59:23.914]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:59:23.914 --> 01:59:24.454]  2030 Agenda.
[01:59:24.454 --> 01:59:36.383]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:59:36.383 --> 01:59:37.944]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:59:37.944 --> 01:59:41.627]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:59:41.627 --> 01:59:42.568]  I mean, what?
[01:59:42.568 --> 01:59:44.790]  I mean, never!
[01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:47.772]  At infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:51.361 --> 02:00:01.828]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.828 --> 02:00:13.155]  I know you loved me a long time ago.
[02:00:13.155 --> 02:00:15.537]  And even now in my
[02:00:20.635 --> 02:00:24.359]  All right, Roger.
[02:00:24.359 --> 02:00:25.540]  You're hosting the fourth hour.
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:34.570]  You're going to get into all this treachery and the crap that's going on and the stuff Steve Bannon's up to.
[02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.572]  I'm not going to even get into it on air.
[02:00:36.572 --> 02:00:37.753]  He just is worse than I thought.
[02:00:37.753 --> 02:00:39.315]  God almighty.
[02:00:39.315 --> 02:00:41.617]  And he thinks he's so smart.
[02:00:44.827 --> 02:00:50.988]  But finishing up before we come on at four o'clock, they don't have anything on you or me because there is nothing.
[02:00:50.988 --> 02:00:53.889]  We are sickeningly pro-America.
[02:00:53.889 --> 02:00:57.330]  We are thoroughbreds, and everybody knows it.
[02:00:57.330 --> 02:01:02.451]  And you famously busted a Russian spy ring in the 80s.
[02:01:02.451 --> 02:01:05.231]  And you cut your teeth at the feet of Richard Nixon.
[02:01:05.231 --> 02:01:07.372]  So no one is buying this crap unless
[02:01:08.598 --> 02:01:09.460]  And that's what I don't like.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:16.957]  When I said you, I'm not going to say me because I don't want to be taken out of context by certain parties, but when I give you that warning, I'm giving myself that warning.
[02:01:16.957 --> 02:01:18.200]  I will never commit suicide.
[02:01:19.167 --> 02:01:21.029]  I don't use drugs or they kill me with an OD.
[02:01:21.029 --> 02:01:24.672]  If I get T-boned at an intersection, investigate the driver.
[02:01:24.672 --> 02:01:26.673]  Because everybody T-boned you and the rest of it.
[02:01:26.673 --> 02:01:29.876]  You really did get shot with a uranium gelatin dart.
[02:01:29.876 --> 02:01:31.477]  But it bounced off the surface.
[02:01:31.477 --> 02:01:32.838]  You only got partial impact.
[02:01:32.838 --> 02:01:33.959]  This is real, folks.
[02:01:33.959 --> 02:01:34.900]  This is the level we're at.
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.903]  You know, I'm out on the news every show, every hour for no reason, and Roger isn't.
[02:01:38.903 --> 02:01:45.668]  They're honing in on us in some narrative, and I don't see them executing this narrative unless we're pushing daisies.
[02:01:45.668 --> 02:01:48.591]  So I'm saying this now to preempt that, Roger.
[02:01:49.542 --> 02:01:50.583]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:01:50.583 --> 02:01:58.128]  So reports that I'm embattled, that I'm depressed, that I'm frantic, this is all false.
[02:01:58.128 --> 02:02:08.435]  If it is reported publicly that I killed myself, launch an investigation because I'm fine and I have no intention of doing anything other than fighting.
[02:02:08.895 --> 02:02:13.156]  But this idea that I'm cornered, that I'm trapped is false.
[02:02:13.156 --> 02:02:22.199]  The facts are what the facts are and there is no evidence to the contrary and nobody who can testify honestly to the contrary.
[02:02:22.199 --> 02:02:31.382]  I have no choice but just keep presenting the facts as they are as I did in two polygraph exams analyzed by two of the leading experts in the country.
[02:02:31.382 --> 02:02:37.204]  I didn't go down to the corner to lie detectors are us or put somebody out of the phone book.
[02:02:37.204 --> 02:02:38.084]  That is the truth.
[02:02:40.455 --> 02:02:42.638]  We're going to put that headline on screen too.
[02:02:42.638 --> 02:02:46.623]  ABC News, for everybody to see that you've taken two lie detectors.
[02:02:46.623 --> 02:02:48.466]  That's also at Stone Cold Truth.
[02:02:48.466 --> 02:02:50.488]  ABC, Stone, Pass, Lie Detector Test.
[02:02:50.488 --> 02:02:52.831]  I'm going to post that article to InfoWars.com.
[02:02:52.831 --> 02:02:54.614]  You have it at Stone Cold Truth as well.
[02:02:54.614 --> 02:02:55.455]  That's a big story.
[02:02:55.455 --> 02:02:56.436]  They're trying to bury that.
[02:02:56.436 --> 02:02:57.758]  Tell us a little bit more about that, Roger.
[02:02:58.703 --> 02:03:06.865]  Well, I got a new lawyer who's joined my legal team, Bruce Rogow, who's represented Donald Trump in some major cases in the past.
[02:03:06.865 --> 02:03:14.387]  He's both a constitutional civil and a criminal attorney, has been before the US Supreme Court many times.
[02:03:14.387 --> 02:03:20.529]  He's joining my legal team of Grant Smith and Rob Buchel and Tara Campion.
[02:03:20.529 --> 02:03:20.809]  It was
[02:03:21.614 --> 02:03:29.402]  Bruce Rogow's recommendation that we find a reputable polygraph examiner and that I take a polygraph.
[02:03:29.402 --> 02:03:30.903]  I took two.
[02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:36.068]  We've made the results available to multiple news outlets, including ABC.
[02:03:36.068 --> 02:03:37.890]  We took it to a second expert.
[02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:39.531]  I took a second test.
[02:03:39.531 --> 02:03:41.193]  The same exact questions.
[02:03:41.193 --> 02:03:42.314]  I passed it again.
[02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:46.438]  You now have two experts who have given expert analysis.
[02:03:46.918 --> 02:03:49.741]  Everything they do is counting on us not having memories.
[02:03:49.741 --> 02:03:50.342]  We were all there.
[02:03:50.342 --> 02:03:52.384]  We remember the big hunt for the emails.
[02:03:52.384 --> 02:03:53.706]  Why won't Assange release them early?
[02:03:53.706 --> 02:03:55.087]  Who's gonna get it?
[02:03:55.087 --> 02:03:57.590]  Why won't Assange give the time of day to people that support him?
[02:04:09.102 --> 02:04:13.344]  We were the bastard children out here trying to get through just to get him on.
[02:04:13.344 --> 02:04:14.624]  That was totally normal.
[02:04:14.624 --> 02:04:17.186]  He was on ABC, CBS, NBC at that time.
[02:04:17.186 --> 02:04:23.248]  And now, after the election, they go, stone-coordinated and all, with WikiLeaks and Alex Jones.
[02:04:23.248 --> 02:04:24.809]  And then he ran into FBI agents.
[02:04:24.809 --> 02:04:27.590]  They're like, shaky, you and Jones are so powerful and evil.
[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:29.391]  They're like afraid of us.
[02:04:29.391 --> 02:04:31.472]  And they have just built this delusion.
[02:04:31.472 --> 02:04:32.232]  Great job, Roger.
[02:04:32.232 --> 02:04:33.913]  You're back in 55 minutes.
[02:04:33.913 --> 02:04:35.954]  Here's your song, The Eye of the Tiger.
[02:04:39.124 --> 02:04:40.487]  I'm not backing down, folks.
[02:04:40.487 --> 02:04:44.534]  We're rising to the challenge!
[02:04:44.534 --> 02:04:45.896]  I trade my passion for glory!

[02:06:24.104 --> 02:06:29.009]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:06:31.026 --> 02:06:39.174]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum, who are beholden to scum!
[02:06:39.174 --> 02:06:39.875]  Russian scum!

[02:06:52.847 --> 02:06:58.169]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[02:06:58.169 --> 02:07:02.691]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:07:02.691 --> 02:07:04.692]  Sleep.
[02:07:04.692 --> 02:07:06.632]  Sleep.
[02:07:06.632 --> 02:07:06.933]  Sleep.
[02:07:06.933 --> 02:07:08.313]  Oh my God!
[02:07:08.313 --> 02:07:09.053]  Oh my God!
[02:07:09.053 --> 02:07:09.514]  Oh my God!
[02:07:09.514 --> 02:07:10.314]  Lock the door!
[02:07:10.314 --> 02:07:10.794]  Lock the door!
[02:07:10.794 --> 02:07:11.694]  They're coming!
[02:07:11.694 --> 02:07:12.815]  They're coming!
[02:07:12.815 --> 02:07:13.535]  Help!
[02:07:13.535 --> 02:07:14.275]  Help!
[02:07:14.275 --> 02:07:15.216]  They're coming!
[02:07:15.216 --> 02:07:15.936]  They're coming!
[02:07:15.936 --> 02:07:16.876]  Listen to me!
[02:07:16.876 --> 02:07:17.337]  Listen!
[02:07:17.337 --> 02:07:17.577]  Help me!
[02:07:19.916 --> 02:07:20.537]  Please!
[02:07:20.537 --> 02:07:21.938]  Your necks are in danger!
[02:07:21.938 --> 02:07:22.999]  Please, listen to me!
[02:07:22.999 --> 02:07:23.940]  It's something terrible!
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:24.180]  Please!
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:25.441]  Your necks are in the air!
[02:07:25.441 --> 02:07:26.482]  They're already here!
[02:07:26.482 --> 02:07:26.882]  Help!
[02:07:26.882 --> 02:07:28.504]  Your necks!
[02:07:28.504 --> 02:07:29.885]  They're coming!
[02:07:29.885 --> 02:07:31.847]  They're coming!
[02:07:31.847 --> 02:07:32.688]  Sleep.
[02:07:32.688 --> 02:07:33.808]  The seed is planted.
[02:07:33.808 --> 02:07:35.770]  Sleep.
[02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:36.711]  Sleep.
[02:07:36.711 --> 02:07:37.812]  Terror grows.
[02:07:37.812 --> 02:07:38.172]  Sleep.
[02:07:38.172 --> 02:07:40.054]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:07:40.054 --> 02:07:41.635]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[02:07:41.635 --> 02:07:43.297]  Sit up!
[02:07:43.297 --> 02:07:45.519]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[02:07:46.941 --> 02:07:49.143]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:07:49.143 --> 02:07:50.585]  Is it contagious?
[02:07:50.585 --> 02:07:51.325]  Mom!
[02:07:51.325 --> 02:07:52.547]  Brianna, help me!
[02:07:52.547 --> 02:07:53.587]  It looked right at me.
[02:07:53.587 --> 02:07:54.448]  You need to get out!
[02:07:54.448 --> 02:07:56.330]  I'm looking at it as if it was human.
[02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:58.973]  I'm not human.
[02:07:58.973 --> 02:08:02.095]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:08:02.095 --> 02:08:03.877]  We're being cornered!
[02:08:03.877 --> 02:08:07.400]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:08:34.275 --> 02:08:39.257]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:39.257 --> 02:08:41.678]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.678 --> 02:08:45.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:45.579 --> 02:08:49.461]  Let me just say something.
[02:08:49.461 --> 02:08:53.463]  I'm not gay, but Owen looks really sharp today over here.
[02:08:53.463 --> 02:08:56.244]  Damn, that is a good looking jacket.
[02:08:56.244 --> 02:08:57.404]  Thank you.
[02:08:57.404 --> 02:08:58.184]  Thank you, that's very kind.
[02:08:58.184 --> 02:08:59.265]  It's kind of a Halloween special.
[02:08:59.265 --> 02:09:00.825]  You look very slicked up here.
[02:09:00.825 --> 02:09:02.166]  It's a Halloween special today.
[02:09:03.704 --> 02:09:09.629]  And, you know, on this Halloween, I hear that we're going to be visited by some special frogs.
[02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:11.171]  That's why I said I'm getting in the mode.
[02:09:11.171 --> 02:09:15.074]  I'm getting in the... Ribbit.
[02:09:15.074 --> 02:09:19.278]  I'm a method actor, as they say, and I've got to get into the gay frog mode.
[02:09:19.278 --> 02:09:21.740]  Yes, it doesn't take you long with all the atrazine in the water.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:24.342]  You notice I'm wearing a green shirt.
[02:09:24.342 --> 02:09:24.943]  Ribbit.
[02:09:24.943 --> 02:09:27.365]  We have a posthumous gay frog actually over here, Alex.
[02:09:30.426 --> 02:09:31.786]  So it's all coming up.
[02:09:31.786 --> 02:09:39.870]  Yeah, I heard in the third hour of the war room that the gay frog is going to make its first appearance, a new character.
[02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:45.712]  Well, I'm looking forward to it, but it is Halloween and it is good for the gay frogs to come out.
[02:09:45.712 --> 02:09:49.234]  I'm getting into the mode that I'm a gay frog and I'm kind of believing this right now.
[02:09:49.234 --> 02:09:52.175]  And then you may, you may get a call from Pepe later as well.
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:58.723]  Alright, just get ready folks, because, again, it's like my ex-wife didn't court.
[02:09:58.723 --> 02:09:59.303]  Love her to death.
[02:09:59.303 --> 02:10:00.244]  She's such a good person.
[02:10:00.244 --> 02:10:01.144]  We fought before.
[02:10:01.144 --> 02:10:03.686]  We're getting along really good now.
[02:10:03.686 --> 02:10:09.450]  And, just a couple years ago in court, they're going to have this hearing, and I'm crazy, and they're showing the judge clips of me
[02:10:10.512 --> 02:10:13.693]  When I was the Joker, like, eight years ago, saying crazy things.
[02:10:13.693 --> 02:10:16.855]  And I was illustrating that Prozac and things are really bad for you.
[02:10:16.855 --> 02:10:19.916]  But I was saying, kids, take your Prozac, see pretty colors.
[02:10:19.916 --> 02:10:22.117]  Ah, then you die and go in the grave, and it's fun.
[02:10:22.117 --> 02:10:25.698]  And they're saying, he's psychotic, he needs to lose his kids.
[02:10:25.698 --> 02:10:27.619]  My lawyer goes, no, he's being an actor there.
[02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.220]  So that's where you get the whole thing, I'm an actor.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:42.185]  I totally live everything I say on the show when I'm being serious, but if I'm in a Cobra Commander outfit, or if I'm in a Joker outfit, or if I arrive as a gay frog today, kind of looking like Cousin Chet in Weird Science.
[02:10:43.223 --> 02:10:46.665]  Let me pull up Cousin Chet and turn into a monster at the end of Word Science.
[02:10:46.665 --> 02:10:49.887]  You see Alex, that's actually fun, that's entertainment, your audience loves it.
[02:10:49.887 --> 02:10:52.208]  But I don't literally believe I'm a gay frog.
[02:10:52.208 --> 02:11:00.412]  But see, but here's the scary thing, since it is Halloween, in the spirit of Halloween, I mean, you want to get something scary, you tune in, you played the clip earlier to CNN.
[02:11:00.412 --> 02:11:00.893]  Don Lemon.
[02:11:00.893 --> 02:11:02.013]  Where Don Lemon.
[02:11:02.013 --> 02:11:04.174]  Says white men, let's cue that back up.
[02:11:04.174 --> 02:11:08.317]  Well first he says though, you know, we need to stop dehumanizing and stop the divisiveness.
[02:11:08.317 --> 02:11:11.558]  Then he says, all white men are bad, we need to ban white men.
[02:11:11.558 --> 02:11:12.259]  It's like,
[02:11:13.263 --> 02:11:13.723]  Wow.
[02:11:13.723 --> 02:11:16.485]  I mean, Don Lemon, you are... But see, that's the theme.
[02:11:16.485 --> 02:11:17.305]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:11:17.305 --> 02:11:18.606]  Infowars.com.
[02:11:18.606 --> 02:11:20.667]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:11:20.667 --> 02:11:21.627]  Where is my article?
[02:11:21.627 --> 02:11:31.632]  New York Times op-ed brags of replacing embattled white conservative minority, or embittered white conservative minority.
[02:11:31.632 --> 02:11:32.973]  And then it's saying whites
[02:11:34.375 --> 02:11:35.917]  Are inherently bad.
[02:11:35.917 --> 02:11:44.445]  This is literal Adolf Hitler stuff, just from the minority perspective, but it's never even minorities that are writing it.
[02:11:44.445 --> 02:11:51.252]  It's weird white professors that look at demographics and try to sell race-based ideology to them.
[02:11:51.252 --> 02:11:55.195]  This is literally Hitler, and then they're calling us Hitler.
[02:11:55.195 --> 02:11:58.459]  And then we're anti-Semitic because we don't want to blow Israel up.
[02:11:58.999 --> 02:12:02.105]  Well, those narratives are honestly mind-blowing.
[02:12:02.105 --> 02:12:03.167]  Trump's a Nazi.
[02:12:03.167 --> 02:12:05.030]  Trump's a... Ribbit.
[02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:06.973]  Trump's an Israeli shill.
[02:12:06.973 --> 02:12:07.574]  I mean, you know, it's...
[02:12:09.656 --> 02:12:10.557]  You know what I am?
[02:12:10.557 --> 02:12:12.838]  I want to have a prosperous future for my kids.
[02:12:12.838 --> 02:12:13.759]  That's what I want.
[02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:14.580]  Well, here's the deal, Alex.
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:15.300]  That's why I came on.
[02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:18.803]  And that's not a good place when we're all killing each other and hate each other and are racist.
[02:12:18.803 --> 02:12:24.367]  And that's exactly why... But I'm not going to roll over the left telling me I'm a racist when they're a bunch of flaming, dangerous scum!
[02:12:24.367 --> 02:12:25.889]  So what do I stand for politically, Alex?
[02:12:25.889 --> 02:12:26.709]  Flaming racists!
[02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:27.830]  What do you stand for politically?
[02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:29.031]  What does Trump stand for politically?
[02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:30.212]  We want lower taxes.
[02:12:30.212 --> 02:12:31.153]  Unity, prosperity.
[02:12:31.153 --> 02:12:31.873]  We want more jobs.
[02:12:31.873 --> 02:12:33.034]  Space force.
[02:12:33.034 --> 02:12:36.657]  And so that's why the reason I came on today... I want silver jetpacks and I want them now.
[02:12:37.057 --> 02:12:39.799]  And I want to actually... I want flying cars, I want live extension technology.
[02:12:39.799 --> 02:12:40.880]  Build our infrastructure.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.181]  I want it all!
[02:12:42.181 --> 02:12:45.544]  And you know, if they want to be a racist, black, nationalist planet, go do that.
[02:12:45.544 --> 02:12:47.006]  White supremacists can have their own planet.
[02:12:47.006 --> 02:12:50.268]  Of course, you know, in about 500 years, we'll all have big wars.
[02:12:50.268 --> 02:12:50.949]  But you know who'll win?
[02:12:50.949 --> 02:12:53.991]  It's gonna be the big, cool planet everybody can be on.
[02:12:53.991 --> 02:12:56.373]  Planet America!
[02:12:56.373 --> 02:13:01.178]  We need to name the first big, habitable planet America, and it'll take over the whole galaxy.
[02:13:02.042 --> 02:13:06.345]  Then they'll be pissed off, few areas that can barely get their spaceships to us.
[02:13:06.345 --> 02:13:11.289]  We'll be like super advanced with huge eggheads, but they'll be bitching trying to take our planet over.
[02:13:11.289 --> 02:13:13.631]  Your planet sucks, but we want to take it over!
[02:13:13.631 --> 02:13:21.838]  Alexander Soros III's head in a jar will be sending his hordes from all the other planets... Floating in a big jar with like tentacles?
[02:13:21.838 --> 02:13:24.179]  Mom, we've destroyed planet America.
[02:13:24.179 --> 02:13:26.281]  I know you're not talking about him, but I will.
[02:13:29.083 --> 02:13:30.184]  Bob Soros.
[02:13:30.184 --> 02:13:32.044]  Soros the third here.
[02:13:32.044 --> 02:13:34.425]  Do we have audio yet on this?
[02:13:34.425 --> 02:13:35.286]  You will.
[02:13:35.286 --> 02:13:36.966]  You will invade planet America.
[02:13:36.966 --> 02:13:37.987]  Do we have audio on this yet?
[02:13:37.987 --> 02:13:40.228]  You will invade planet America.
[02:13:40.228 --> 02:13:40.868]  Don't scramble.
[02:13:40.868 --> 02:13:42.069]  If you don't have it, it's okay.
[02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:46.491]  Do we have audio on this feed yet?
[02:13:46.491 --> 02:13:47.551]  Houston?
[02:13:47.551 --> 02:13:49.272]  Houston, we're on the other side of the moon here.
[02:13:49.272 --> 02:13:49.652]  Do you hear me?
[02:13:51.638 --> 02:13:53.260]  We do have audio of this clip, okay.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:57.865]  This is us in a time machine a few years ago, interviewing Alexander Soros.
[02:13:57.865 --> 02:13:59.627]  Back it up, it's why he's pissed off at us.
[02:13:59.627 --> 02:14:06.174]  Okay, here it is.
[02:14:06.174 --> 02:14:09.058]  That's nasty, why?
[02:14:09.058 --> 02:14:10.079]  That's a check, Gary.
[02:14:21.061 --> 02:14:21.642]  Oh my God!
[02:14:27.339 --> 02:14:31.522]  So now they'll say this segment is anti-Semitic because you mentioned George Soros.
[02:14:31.522 --> 02:14:34.045]  But here's the good news, none of it works anymore.
[02:14:34.045 --> 02:14:40.451]  But Blue Dobbs, I keep going back to that piece you did last Thursday, where they show the documents, the admission, that the UN is getting U.S.
[02:14:40.451 --> 02:14:52.362]  taxpayer money and giving it to Soros and others, and it's all admitted to ship these people and the buses are waiting, and they act like that's not true, and that we have it all on video from years ago, and even lately, and then Blue Dobbs may be fired.
[02:14:52.682 --> 02:14:57.668]  Well, it's almost ridiculous that we kind of go along with this false narrative of this caravan now.
[02:14:57.668 --> 02:14:58.689]  This has been a caravan.
[02:14:58.689 --> 02:15:03.314]  They've been doing it 10, 20 times a year, coming in by the tens of the thousands.
[02:15:03.314 --> 02:15:05.877]  It's just now we're finally deciding to do something about it.
[02:15:05.877 --> 02:15:07.018]  But they want to have the optics.
[02:15:07.018 --> 02:15:08.019]  That's what this is all about.
[02:15:08.019 --> 02:15:13.105]  Building up to the optics so that they'll have the military at the border, women and children crying at the border, and they'll say,
[02:15:13.345 --> 02:15:16.306]  Trump's America bullying women and children.
[02:15:16.306 --> 02:15:17.787]  That's why they're building this whole thing up.
[02:15:17.787 --> 02:15:19.588]  That's why they're busting them all in.
[02:15:19.588 --> 02:15:25.451]  And it's mostly, you know, 80% military-age men that are coming on this deal, but they'll put the women and children in front.
[02:15:27.048 --> 02:15:30.390]  They're criminals, and I agree.
[02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:32.692]  I'm worried about groups infiltrating the militia.
[02:15:32.692 --> 02:15:34.554]  I'm not saying the militia's bad, they're great.
[02:15:34.554 --> 02:15:37.836]  Feds running militias, though, will say, he's saying we're feds!
[02:15:37.836 --> 02:15:39.697]  No, that's the feds speaking.
[02:15:39.697 --> 02:15:47.603]  I'm saying look out for federal, globalist, leftist groups that control federal groups infiltrating the militias and shooting some of these people.
[02:15:47.603 --> 02:15:50.465]  We'll talk about that and some breaking news straight ahead.

[02:16:25.676 --> 02:16:26.896]  Hear that?
[02:16:26.896 --> 02:16:32.278]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:16:32.278 --> 02:16:35.179]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:16:35.179 --> 02:16:38.760]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:16:55.345 --> 02:17:01.689]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.689 --> 02:17:04.731]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.731 --> 02:17:10.635]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.635 --> 02:17:14.438]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:14.438 --> 02:17:15.719]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.719 --> 02:17:17.060]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:23.264]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:23.264 --> 02:17:24.685]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:25.545 --> 02:17:26.766]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:26.766 --> 02:17:30.687]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:30.687 --> 02:17:32.228]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:32.228 --> 02:17:35.189]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:35.189 --> 02:17:40.752]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:41.952]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:41.952 --> 02:17:44.894]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:44.894 --> 02:17:47.115]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:47.115 --> 02:17:51.557]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[02:17:56.533 --> 02:18:00.796]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:18:00.796 --> 02:18:04.278]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.278 --> 02:18:06.039]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:06.039 --> 02:18:09.301]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.301 --> 02:18:16.085]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:16.085 --> 02:18:21.168]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:18:21.508 --> 02:18:27.610]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:30.591]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.591 --> 02:18:31.692]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.692 --> 02:18:35.493]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.493 --> 02:18:37.534]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.534 --> 02:18:38.835]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.835 --> 02:18:39.895]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:39.895 --> 02:18:41.556]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.556 --> 02:18:44.477]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:44.477 --> 02:18:45.797]  I will never falter.
[02:18:45.797 --> 02:18:47.818]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:48.118 --> 02:18:55.827]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWareStore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.

[02:19:59.358 --> 02:20:10.826]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.826 --> 02:20:23.874]  Live from ATX, broadcasting worldwide, it's the Gay Frog Show with Owen Schreier and the Gay Frog, Alex Jones!
[02:20:23.874 --> 02:20:27.477]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:29.737 --> 02:20:34.102]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.102 --> 02:20:34.882]  Hi, I'm Warren Green.
[02:20:34.882 --> 02:20:36.384]  Okay, I'm going to stop the gay frog jokes.
[02:20:36.384 --> 02:20:40.508]  It's too much serious stuff and a lot of radio stations and serious people.
[02:20:40.508 --> 02:20:45.093]  I was in court a few weeks ago on a child custody issue.
[02:20:47.731 --> 02:20:49.893]  Well, I got full custody of my children.
[02:20:49.893 --> 02:20:51.954]  You know, the media says I don't have my children.
[02:20:51.954 --> 02:20:56.578]  Well, I never did not have them, but I have about 90% of the time right now.
[02:20:56.578 --> 02:20:59.420]  And by the grace of God, they're doing good and they're happy.
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:01.101]  So I want to thank everybody for their prayers and everything.
[02:21:01.101 --> 02:21:02.982]  It's a little sad poem I thought I'd add.
[02:21:02.982 --> 02:21:05.444]  But the judge did ask me, what's this gay frog thing?
[02:21:05.444 --> 02:21:06.925]  Because that got raised.
[02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:08.006]  And I said, it's a meme.
[02:21:08.006 --> 02:21:09.928]  And she said, what's that?
[02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:10.868]  And I said, well,
[02:21:12.094 --> 02:21:18.317]  I said it's like a joke somebody makes, and then other people keep making jokes off of it.
[02:21:18.317 --> 02:21:20.218]  It's almost like dominoes, like playing dominoes.
[02:21:20.218 --> 02:21:24.740]  And then she understood that, but it made me think, what are memes?
[02:21:25.947 --> 02:21:28.288]  Because they can be negative, they can be funny, they can be positive.
[02:21:28.288 --> 02:21:29.448]  It's kind of like innovation.
[02:21:29.448 --> 02:21:30.068]  You know what I mean?
[02:21:30.068 --> 02:21:32.809]  And then you just keep making a joke off the same thing.
[02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:33.329]  It's beautiful.
[02:21:33.329 --> 02:21:37.330]  And the UN and the globalists and all these groups want to ban it.
[02:21:37.330 --> 02:21:42.672]  Then they act like the gay frog meme that I didn't even make is hateful towards gay people.
[02:21:42.672 --> 02:21:43.692]  It's not!
[02:21:43.692 --> 02:21:47.633]  I don't care if you're heterosexual, homosexual, what it is.
[02:21:47.633 --> 02:21:53.895]  Leave kids alone and don't have drag queens go talk to five-year-olds on career day to tell them you can dress up like a woman.
[02:21:55.174 --> 02:21:57.035]  I mean, it's all just an angle.
[02:21:57.035 --> 02:22:02.556]  That's not a career playing princess when you're 30 years old.
[02:22:02.556 --> 02:22:08.138]  And now I think that there's going to be some people looking into this because more people are complaining.
[02:22:08.138 --> 02:22:11.659]  Not only that it's at public libraries, but public schools now as well.
[02:22:11.659 --> 02:22:13.900]  Yeah, the sexualization of children is going on.
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:14.820]  Leave the kids alone.
[02:22:16.158 --> 02:22:23.421]  I mean, if a man came in and wanted to talk about his sexual preferences to your kid at a park, he'd go to jail.
[02:22:23.421 --> 02:22:25.702]  Well, here's what a meme is, really, to me.
[02:22:25.702 --> 02:22:27.022]  It's multidimensional.
[02:22:27.022 --> 02:22:36.946]  There's the meme moment when you're actually making a meme, like when Age Skrillex comes up to me and says, you're an effing white male!
[02:22:37.486 --> 02:22:39.267]  And he's an effing white male.
[02:22:39.267 --> 02:22:40.207]  That's a meme.
[02:22:40.207 --> 02:22:41.648]  And the other guy goes, yeah!
[02:22:41.648 --> 02:22:42.969]  It's horrible!
[02:22:42.969 --> 02:22:45.170]  Oh, white males are bad!
[02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:47.051]  And he's a white male.
[02:22:47.051 --> 02:22:51.673]  Or you running down the guy that poured coffee on you in Seattle.
[02:22:51.673 --> 02:22:53.394]  That's a meme moment.
[02:22:53.394 --> 02:22:55.595]  You run the guy down the street, he pours coffee on you.
[02:22:55.595 --> 02:22:56.896]  That becomes a meme.
[02:22:56.896 --> 02:22:58.677]  Yeah, there's Carl the Cuck.
[02:22:58.677 --> 02:22:59.797]  So those are meme moments.
[02:22:59.797 --> 02:23:00.838]  Then there's the actual
[02:23:01.758 --> 02:23:02.799]  Literal meme.
[02:23:02.799 --> 02:23:03.920]  Chain reaction.
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:04.460]  Yes.
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:20.471]  Or the NPC, that's like meme magic, where the NPC meme like represents what's going on in real life, but then there's the literal just physical representation of meme, which is an art form now, which is like an image, like an NPC that then becomes... And so in Mexico they've got a lot of ban it.
[02:23:20.471 --> 02:23:22.012]  They have banned them in the EU.
[02:23:22.012 --> 02:23:27.215]  Of course it isn't stopping anything, but they're saying jail time, just you made an image and put words on it.
[02:23:27.215 --> 02:23:28.856]  It's like when... Language is banned!
[02:23:28.856 --> 02:23:29.897]  The wheel is banned!
[02:23:30.277 --> 02:23:31.638]  Fire is banned!
[02:23:31.638 --> 02:23:34.760]  But hey, Merkel still just got kicked out of office.
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:38.422]  Uh-oh, we just saw the Trump of Brazil get elected.
[02:23:38.422 --> 02:23:43.705]  Italy is moving nationalists now as well, so 1776 worldwide.
[02:23:43.705 --> 02:23:45.586]  Globalism has failed.
[02:23:45.586 --> 02:23:49.989]  Facebook and Twitter are getting ready to tank their stock, that's already admitted.
[02:23:49.989 --> 02:23:51.350]  But listen, you have a big announcement to make.
[02:23:51.350 --> 02:23:52.671]  We're going to make it in just a moment.
[02:23:53.973 --> 02:23:55.114]  I've got all sorts of serious news.
[02:23:55.114 --> 02:23:57.935]  I feel good about things right now, in my spirit.
[02:23:57.935 --> 02:24:00.557]  Because I felt like things would tuck and go until, like, this morning.
[02:24:00.557 --> 02:24:01.858]  And I do go off the sixth sense.
[02:24:01.858 --> 02:24:02.878]  I pick it up.
[02:24:02.878 --> 02:24:07.581]  I feel like a big weight's been lifted off me, like I said before the last election.
[02:24:07.581 --> 02:24:10.923]  Then when we won, a bigger weight came on, because then the enemy combination came in.
[02:24:11.834 --> 02:24:19.216]  But I am really concerned about them infiltrating, because most militias are infiltrated by leftist ADLs, Southern Property Law Center operatives.
[02:24:19.216 --> 02:24:20.136]  That's a fact.
[02:24:20.136 --> 02:24:24.157]  And anytime a militia leader goes, SHUT UP, JONES, YOU'RE THE FED!
[02:24:24.157 --> 02:24:31.458]  When I'm not saying he's a fed or she's a fed, I'm saying you've been infiltrated, it's a fact, people try to provocateur, watch your butt.
[02:24:31.458 --> 02:24:33.599]  I believe in militias that are in the Constitution.
[02:24:33.599 --> 02:24:34.919]  They're in the Second Amendment.
[02:24:36.274 --> 02:24:48.148]  But I'm telling you, the ace card in Soros' dirty little hand, with him rushing the buses up to the border, people are like, oh don't worry Alex, it'll take him 100 days to get to the border 20 miles a day.
[02:24:48.148 --> 02:24:54.776]  They're being bussed up, they're on flatbacks, and of course it's paid for by Soros on record, that's come out in the news.
[02:24:56.010 --> 02:25:07.823]  So they're coming, they want to hit a few days before the election, and they're going to hire people that are civilians that go, ah, hey, Mexican, big pot-bellied guy who works at the Sun Power Law Center.
[02:25:07.823 --> 02:25:12.107]  He'll run up, hit a little girl in the head and go, oh, like WWF wrestling.
[02:25:12.107 --> 02:25:13.368]  I'm telling you, it's coming.
[02:25:13.368 --> 02:25:14.409]  Well, it's just common sense.
[02:25:14.409 --> 02:25:16.512]  Of course, there's going to be provocateurs trying to
[02:25:18.118 --> 02:25:19.919]  Engage in some sort of chicanery.
[02:25:19.919 --> 02:25:22.520]  This is just like with Rand Paul when he was about to win the Senate.
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:28.362]  They had Democrat Party operatives literally wearing overalls and hayseeds going, I hate black people.
[02:25:28.362 --> 02:25:29.743]  I hate Mexicans.
[02:25:29.743 --> 02:25:32.064]  And then we did Google searches on their face.
[02:25:32.064 --> 02:25:36.425]  And it's like it's the deputy head of the regional campaign.
[02:25:36.425 --> 02:25:39.067]  They don't they think we're that like actually overalls.
[02:25:39.067 --> 02:25:41.007]  How you doing there boy?
[02:25:41.007 --> 02:25:42.368]  I love Rand Paul.
[02:25:42.788 --> 02:25:44.372]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[02:25:44.372 --> 02:25:52.008]  Well, I think they're gonna actually have people inside the caravan, and who knows, you know, you throw... I like the KKK, and I like to cook!
[02:25:52.745 --> 02:25:56.889]  Or you throw up a firework from, you know, the other side of the border.
[02:25:56.889 --> 02:25:58.951]  You're in the caravan, you throw some fireworks over.
[02:25:58.951 --> 02:26:00.352]  Now, you know, you've got the military over there.
[02:26:00.352 --> 02:26:00.913]  They're spooked.
[02:26:00.913 --> 02:26:01.573]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:26:01.573 --> 02:26:02.234]  They shoot.
[02:26:02.234 --> 02:26:04.075]  So, and then, boom, there it is.
[02:26:04.075 --> 02:26:06.478]  You know, there's a... Shot heard around the world.
[02:26:06.478 --> 02:26:08.359]  That's what Soros is betting on.
[02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:10.541]  And we can't let him keep betting and losing.
[02:26:10.541 --> 02:26:12.243]  Keep trying to do this.
[02:26:12.243 --> 02:26:13.884]  He's a clear and present criminal.
[02:26:13.884 --> 02:26:15.346]  Like Lou Dobbs said, he needs to be arrested.
[02:26:16.161 --> 02:26:20.588]  And of course, who is right there to try to get Lou Dobbs kicked off of Fox Business?
[02:26:20.588 --> 02:26:22.752]  It's Oliver Darcy.
[02:26:22.752 --> 02:26:24.054]  Oliver Darcy?
[02:26:24.054 --> 02:26:25.517]  Brian Stelter.
[02:26:25.517 --> 02:26:28.482]  You're not allowed to, in public, even say how dare you be against the First Amendment.
[02:26:32.644 --> 02:26:37.008]  Down flies the Valkyries of Big Tech protecting their little nestling.
[02:26:37.008 --> 02:26:39.470]  His little retarded nestling.
[02:26:39.470 --> 02:26:45.736]  I feel like Stelter and Darcy, I feel like they haven't gotten the memo that it's only Halloween one night a year.
[02:26:45.736 --> 02:26:48.839]  I mean, this is what they've got up against us.
[02:26:48.839 --> 02:26:50.060]  They're losers, man.
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:51.841]  They'll never win.
[02:26:51.841 --> 02:26:53.403]  Just look at that guy.
[02:26:53.403 --> 02:26:55.325]  Just look at that slime bucket.
[02:26:56.314 --> 02:26:59.195]  That, and that guy's got access to everything.
[02:26:59.195 --> 02:27:03.898]  The tech companies have given him codes to everybody's websites, your private mail.
[02:27:03.898 --> 02:27:05.899]  He's got, he's a super operative.
[02:27:05.899 --> 02:27:11.802]  And that's the type of filth that CNN, the leftist CIA, that breakaway group, this is who they elevate.
[02:27:11.802 --> 02:27:14.363]  They go, Stelter, you look like a child molester.
[02:27:14.363 --> 02:27:15.824]  You're going to the full command base.
[02:27:16.656 --> 02:27:20.759]  And then, yesterday you were talking about one of the Fox News hosts and his body language.
[02:27:20.759 --> 02:27:23.642]  You can just tell how contrived it all is.
[02:27:23.642 --> 02:27:25.804]  Fake Beto is the exact same way.
[02:27:25.804 --> 02:27:33.110]  I mean, you can tell all his... You know Beto in Spanish means... It means horse manure.
[02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.690]  No.
[02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:34.511]  I did not know that.
[02:27:34.511 --> 02:27:35.812]  Remember when I interviewed him?
[02:27:35.812 --> 02:27:36.933]  Oh, I thought that was Beto.
[02:27:36.933 --> 02:27:37.934]  I didn't know that was horse manure.
[02:27:37.934 --> 02:27:38.915]  I thought that was just Beto.
[02:27:39.907 --> 02:27:41.229]  They thought they heard me.
[02:27:41.229 --> 02:27:46.434]  Jones interviews poop calling it Bado, and now I've equated Bado with horse manure all over the nation.
[02:27:46.434 --> 02:27:46.935]  No, wait a second.
[02:27:46.935 --> 02:27:49.717]  I mean, horse manure is a good fertilizer, though.
[02:27:49.717 --> 02:27:55.223]  I mean, it has a use.
[02:27:55.223 --> 02:27:57.786]  Remember when Antifa vandalized the Bado mural?
[02:27:59.071 --> 02:27:59.991]  In Austin, Texas.
[02:27:59.991 --> 02:28:00.872]  And that was really them.
[02:28:00.872 --> 02:28:03.253]  White gentrifier, which he actually is.
[02:28:03.253 --> 02:28:04.974]  He's like a billionaire.
[02:28:04.974 --> 02:28:06.434]  His mom's a famous Democrat.
[02:28:06.434 --> 02:28:08.375]  Everything he says is a lie.
[02:28:08.375 --> 02:28:11.336]  He's so fake, it's unbelievable how fake he is.
[02:28:11.336 --> 02:28:19.480]  He goes up to Obama, and I'm going to tell you, this is like a white guy Obama, and we're going to deal with this, and we're going to ban the assault rifles, and I'm a real Texan.
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.481]  My name's Biko, even though I never was called that before.
[02:28:22.481 --> 02:28:24.922]  Hey Hispanics, I've got a name like you.
[02:28:24.922 --> 02:28:25.723]  I'm really cool.
[02:28:26.627 --> 02:28:27.487]  Ha ha!
[02:28:27.487 --> 02:28:30.368]  I'm the real Hispanic, not Ted Cruz!
[02:28:30.368 --> 02:28:32.429]  I'm Beto O'Rourke!
[02:28:32.429 --> 02:28:35.770]  Did you know O'Rourke is Spanish for lying filth?
[02:28:35.770 --> 02:28:40.491]  Did you know that he actually applied to be in the Hispanic Heritage Caucus and he got rejected?
[02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:40.851]  Yeah!
[02:28:40.851 --> 02:28:42.872]  He identifies as a Hispanic!
[02:28:42.872 --> 02:28:43.892]  I identify as a gay frog!
[02:28:43.892 --> 02:28:45.033]  He's like Elizabeth Warren!
[02:28:45.033 --> 02:28:46.853]  I mean, you know, that's the Democrat's stolen valor!
[02:28:46.853 --> 02:28:47.674]  Pocahontas!
[02:28:47.674 --> 02:28:51.515]  Give valor to minorities and then steal it by claiming you're a minority!
[02:28:51.515 --> 02:28:52.955]  That's what the Democrats do!
[02:28:52.955 --> 02:28:53.756]  We'll be right back!
[02:28:55.578 --> 02:28:56.798]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.798 --> 02:29:00.719]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.719 --> 02:29:02.259]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.259 --> 02:29:05.220]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.220 --> 02:29:10.761]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.761 --> 02:29:11.961]  I can help you, too.

[02:30:06.247 --> 02:30:10.934]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.934 --> 02:30:14.018]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:36.336]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:31:56.075 --> 02:32:00.012]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:32:01.337 --> 02:32:10.039]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:32:10.039 --> 02:32:12.000]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.461]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:32:15.461 --> 02:32:18.081]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:32:18.081 --> 02:32:20.382]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:32:20.382 --> 02:32:27.324]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:32:27.864 --> 02:32:37.666]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:32:37.666 --> 02:32:38.847]  We'll win.
[02:32:38.847 --> 02:32:41.667]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:32:41.667 --> 02:32:48.909]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[02:32:48.909 --> 02:32:52.590]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:54.151]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:32:54.151 --> 02:32:55.011]  We need your support.
[02:32:55.011 --> 02:32:55.571]  I'm counting on you.
[02:32:59.308 --> 02:33:11.316]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.316 --> 02:33:18.561]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.561 --> 02:33:22.904]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[02:33:22.904 --> 02:33:26.387]  I work for 95, hell, I pay the price.
[02:33:26.387 --> 02:33:28.148]  All I want is to be left alone
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:41.406]  You know, we get so much incredible footage that a lot of times, especially when it's banned off YouTube, Facebook, everything else, you didn't get out there unless you get excited about it.
[02:33:41.406 --> 02:33:42.747]  But the footage we've got...
[02:33:44.051 --> 02:33:52.115]  I'm a Beto O'Rourke, Obama supporter, is solid gold when it comes to showing how the left operates.
[02:33:52.115 --> 02:33:58.217]  Because we were there last Monday at the Trump event in Houston, and I'm like, where are the protesters?
[02:33:58.217 --> 02:33:59.658]  They go, oh, they're over there.
[02:33:59.658 --> 02:34:01.759]  There was like 15 of them.
[02:34:01.759 --> 02:34:04.140]  By nighttime, there was about 30.
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:09.222]  And they were literally saying to me, you're a Nazi, you need to go to prison, you're a Russian agent.
[02:34:10.077 --> 02:34:19.025]  I'm like, well the Nazis fought the Russians, they just, there's no, there's not even, like no, I'm an American, not some failed thing from 75 years ago in Germany.
[02:34:19.025 --> 02:34:25.711]  And it just, Nazi KKK, go away, no borders, no walls, no USA at all, and I'm just looking at the enemy of this country.
[02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:37.397]  When you were there, Owen, and we were just trying to walk back by, and he's saying, I'm gonna rape you, I'm gonna come over there, and I'm gonna, a lot of this we have to bleep because of family audiences.
[02:34:37.397 --> 02:34:41.479]  We're gonna post this to Infowars.com the next hour, so you can get it out to people.
[02:34:41.479 --> 02:34:48.423]  Then Owen has a huge announcement we're gonna get to right now, but this is crazy-eyed Beto supporter threatens to rape Alex Jones.
[02:34:48.423 --> 02:34:53.586]  By the way, this is in front of, behind him, and around the side, the police chief and like 50 police.
[02:34:55.313 --> 02:34:59.956]  And the SWAT team just happened to be set up there because Trump was about to come by in about an hour.
[02:34:59.956 --> 02:35:05.941]  So he's right by the motorcade route, and he's right by the Toyota Center.
[02:35:05.941 --> 02:35:07.041]  Well, you were there, Owen.
[02:35:07.041 --> 02:35:08.202]  Set this up for people.
[02:35:08.202 --> 02:35:11.785]  Well, what they had was like a fenced-off area for these people, actually.
[02:35:12.425 --> 02:35:16.908]  And so they were kind of trying to keep him separated, I guess, from the general public.
[02:35:16.908 --> 02:35:17.668]  It's a free speech show.
[02:35:17.668 --> 02:35:21.350]  And they had the stupid, the same balloon from London.
[02:35:21.350 --> 02:35:21.951]  The Trump balloon.
[02:35:21.951 --> 02:35:22.571]  The Trump baby.
[02:35:22.571 --> 02:35:28.034]  But this guy's just shouting obnoxiously at you with the bullhorn and just looking like a crazed individual.
[02:35:28.114 --> 02:35:38.447]  Well if I said to anybody, I should be arrested, I'm coming to rape you, I'm going to shove a yardstick three feet up your rear end and kill you, I'm coming over, I'm gonna kill you, I should be arrested.
[02:35:38.447 --> 02:35:42.031]  I didn't ask the cops to arrest him, I just said officers, did he escape from a mental institution?
[02:35:42.954 --> 02:35:47.537]  Well, I'm sorry, but they were just showing the B-roll of that day and I just kind of refreshed my memory.
[02:35:47.537 --> 02:35:51.200]  The 15 people that were out there, I mean... It's sad, Alex.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:56.523]  These people really... Look, it's frustrating, but these people probably really do belong in mental institutions, some of them.
[02:35:56.523 --> 02:36:01.506]  And, you know, it's frustrating that these are the people that the left activates to come out here.
[02:36:01.506 --> 02:36:02.307]  We should put a meme out.
[02:36:02.307 --> 02:36:03.027]  We haven't done it yet.
[02:36:03.027 --> 02:36:03.568]  Gut flexor.
[02:36:04.068 --> 02:36:04.929]  That was your meme, wasn't it?
[02:36:04.929 --> 02:36:05.589]  Yeah, the gut flexor.
[02:36:05.589 --> 02:36:06.730]  We could do a whole video about it.
[02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:07.891]  Do the gut flexor.
[02:36:07.891 --> 02:36:11.574]  Well, the gut flexor was originally a football coach for the Cleveland Browns.
[02:36:11.574 --> 02:36:13.975]  That was the original meme, but I'd never seen it in person.
[02:36:13.975 --> 02:36:19.299]  This guy, again, one of the guys probably belongs in a mental institution, Alex, but yeah, you know, he shouts with the horns.
[02:36:19.299 --> 02:36:28.166]  And they do this thing, like when I'm at dinner sometimes in a leftist area, because I still go wherever I want, do whatever I want, and they'll come over and knock my iced tea over.
[02:36:29.036 --> 02:36:31.919]  They'll go, shame, shame, shame, boo!
[02:36:31.919 --> 02:36:34.622]  And they'll tell the waiter, how dare you serve this man?
[02:36:34.622 --> 02:36:37.025]  And they'll go, I'm glad you lost your family.
[02:36:37.025 --> 02:36:38.066]  And I'll be sitting there with all my kids.
[02:36:38.066 --> 02:36:42.551]  I'm going, okay, dude, mental institution, bye-bye, you're the one with the problem.
[02:36:42.551 --> 02:36:44.994]  This is why I'm doing this is to stop you.
[02:36:44.994 --> 02:36:47.016]  But they would just shake their heads and go.
[02:36:48.066 --> 02:36:50.167]  We're gonna rape and kill you.
[02:36:50.167 --> 02:36:52.369]  You're such a Nazi.
[02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:56.112]  They're smiling at me like they're in junior high and I'm not at the cool table.
[02:36:56.112 --> 02:37:00.635]  It's like getting to me and like, dude, in junior high, I was dating the high school chicks.
[02:37:00.635 --> 02:37:03.597]  In high school, I was dating the college chicks, okay?
[02:37:03.597 --> 02:37:06.639]  I wanted to get out of the cafeteria, okay?
[02:37:06.639 --> 02:37:09.661]  At lunch, I had the high school girls picking me up in the parking lot, okay, dude?
[02:37:09.661 --> 02:37:11.042]  Bringing me hamburgers.
[02:37:11.042 --> 02:37:15.105]  I'm not bragging, it's just I kind of skipped not being at the cool table at lunch, you know?
[02:37:15.985 --> 02:37:25.674]  Well, you look at these people, though, again, whether it's a Beto protest or I've covered so many of these Trump protests, a lot of these people just genuinely probably belong in a mental institution.
[02:37:25.674 --> 02:37:26.454]  But it's the same thing, Alex.
[02:37:26.454 --> 02:37:30.358]  They'll run up to me if I'm doing a live stream like I was in Washington, D.C.
[02:37:30.358 --> 02:37:30.838]  over the weekend.
[02:37:30.838 --> 02:37:33.180]  They say, gay frog, gay frog!
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:34.441]  And I'm like, well, hey, hold on.
[02:37:34.441 --> 02:37:35.322]  Let's have a conversation.
[02:37:35.322 --> 02:37:36.923]  You know, what are you talking about, gay frogs?
[02:37:36.923 --> 02:37:39.726]  Alex Jones thinks the chemicals are turning the frogs gay!
[02:37:40.126 --> 02:37:41.867]  And I'm like, yeah, well, have you ever heard of Atrazine?
[02:37:41.867 --> 02:37:42.888]  There's a scientific study.
[02:37:42.888 --> 02:37:44.269]  It comes out of Berkeley.
[02:37:44.269 --> 02:37:45.330]  There's PBS shows.
[02:37:45.330 --> 02:37:46.170]  There's videos.
[02:37:46.170 --> 02:37:48.092]  And, you know, it's well documented.
[02:37:48.092 --> 02:37:50.574]  Oh, OK, you fascist Nazi scum!
[02:37:50.574 --> 02:37:51.975]  You racist!
[02:37:51.975 --> 02:37:55.137]  Actually, George Soros is the race baiter that wants to destroy Israel.
[02:37:55.137 --> 02:37:56.638]  I thought we were talking about gay frogs.
[02:37:56.638 --> 02:37:58.559]  Now, you know, I'm a racist, apparently.
[02:37:58.559 --> 02:37:59.060]  But whatever.
[02:38:00.393 --> 02:38:12.567]  And the sad part about the gay frog stuff is, they start having sex, which just means they sit on top of the other male frog, thinking eggs are coming out, but they're not putting their sperm onto eggs.
[02:38:12.567 --> 02:38:15.571]  There are no eggs, so the frog populations are plummeting.
[02:38:15.791 --> 02:38:18.192]  But think about why you actually raised this issue.
[02:38:18.192 --> 02:38:19.073]  You raised this issue.
[02:38:19.073 --> 02:38:20.193]  Because the frogs are dying.
[02:38:20.193 --> 02:38:21.374]  As an environmental issue.
[02:38:21.374 --> 02:38:22.595]  And it's hurting humans.
[02:38:22.595 --> 02:38:31.419]  Here's a man-made environmental issue that you raise awareness of, and then the left, which is supposed to be all about saving the environment from the man-made issues, ignores it.
[02:38:31.419 --> 02:38:32.400]  David Hogg said...
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:33.861]  It's really weird.
[02:38:33.861 --> 02:38:36.723]  He talks about gay frogs and toxins in the water, then he's selling water filters.
[02:38:36.723 --> 02:38:37.324]  It's kind of interesting.
[02:38:37.324 --> 02:38:39.206]  Like it's a big master manipulation.
[02:38:39.206 --> 02:38:39.826]  No.
[02:38:39.826 --> 02:38:41.508]  I sell things you really need that are good.
[02:38:41.508 --> 02:38:42.989]  I feel good about it.
[02:38:42.989 --> 02:38:44.391]  Yeah, like cars are nice.
[02:38:44.391 --> 02:38:46.753]  I'd sell cars or clothes.
[02:38:46.753 --> 02:38:50.377]  If I was going to be a clothier, I would sell what sells and I like.
[02:38:50.377 --> 02:38:52.519]  Like you sell what sells because it's good.
[02:38:52.519 --> 02:38:57.263]  It's like a guy standing on the street corner and it starts raining and he's like, umbrellas for sale.
[02:38:58.075 --> 02:39:00.759]  You're trying to sell me an umbrella because it's raining!
[02:39:00.759 --> 02:39:02.601]  Like, oh, wow.
[02:39:02.601 --> 02:39:04.443]  It's like, wow, you really figured it out.
[02:39:04.443 --> 02:39:06.726]  Like, I'm selling stuff that there's a market for that helps people.
[02:39:06.726 --> 02:39:08.789]  I'm not selling Prozac or cocaine.
[02:39:08.789 --> 02:39:11.652]  And so then, Hogg, my son does a video.
[02:39:12.867 --> 02:39:15.589]  And he says, Mr. Hogg, you ought to look into water filtration.
[02:39:15.589 --> 02:39:16.750]  There's a lot of toxins in the water.
[02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:17.610]  That might be healthy.
[02:39:17.610 --> 02:39:23.214]  National News, Alex Jones' son death threats David Hogg.
[02:39:23.214 --> 02:39:26.217]  Isn't that fun when the news media can just spin it?
[02:39:26.217 --> 02:39:34.863]  And you know, honestly, when this whole Kanye West thing kind of boils down to it, I really think it was the national media that really caused this whole thing to become an issue.
[02:39:34.863 --> 02:39:39.046]  Let's explain it when we come back, and I want to make your announcement, which is so huge and so critical and so important.
[02:39:39.586 --> 02:39:42.227]  That everybody knows what he's doing, but you need to do it, folks, if you want to win.
[02:39:42.227 --> 02:39:43.367]  That's my humble opinion.
[02:39:43.367 --> 02:39:46.808]  Humble water merchant, uh, water filter merchant salesman.
[02:39:46.808 --> 02:39:48.768]  But, but, but here is, I don't know what to call this guy.
[02:39:48.768 --> 02:39:50.629]  He's not Abe Skrillex.
[02:39:50.629 --> 02:39:52.409]  He's not Carl the Cuck.
[02:39:52.409 --> 02:39:55.670]  He's not Prigley Puff.
[02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:56.730]  I mean, what is this guy?
[02:39:56.730 --> 02:40:02.732]  Is, is, is, is this liberal, is this liberal right, right man?
[02:40:02.732 --> 02:40:06.333]  His t-shirt says black identity extremists, so we could just call him that.
[02:40:07.619 --> 02:40:12.140]  Look at the love, look at the tolerance.
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:14.541]  Look at the love, look at the tolerance.
[02:40:14.541 --> 02:40:18.782]  You don't add up to something, you don't add up to something.
[02:40:18.782 --> 02:40:19.322]  I'm not fibble.
[02:40:19.322 --> 02:40:20.922]  I'm not fibble.
[02:40:20.922 --> 02:40:21.762]  I'm not fibble.
[02:40:32.305 --> 02:40:34.327]  And then there's more of it.
[02:40:34.327 --> 02:40:36.088]  Let's just go back to it.
[02:40:36.088 --> 02:40:37.229]  He clearly fed the audio.
[02:40:37.229 --> 02:40:37.309]  Why?
[02:41:02.813 --> 02:41:04.794]  Wouldn't be hard to find it.
[02:41:04.794 --> 02:41:07.235]  Thank you, you just made 10 new Trump voters!
[02:41:07.235 --> 02:41:10.877]  This archetypal image, they say an image tells a thousand words.
[02:41:10.877 --> 02:41:14.699]  This video tells trillions of words.
[02:41:14.699 --> 02:41:19.921]  You have Houston, a city of over 6 million people, Metro 8 million, is that correct?
[02:41:19.921 --> 02:41:20.842]  8 million people, Metro.
[02:41:21.782 --> 02:41:27.607]  And you have got the anti-Trump, anti-America crowd over here.
[02:41:27.607 --> 02:41:30.610]  And this is their full power.
[02:41:30.610 --> 02:41:32.492]  There's like 10 of them.
[02:41:32.492 --> 02:41:34.994]  And they're pumping up the balloon from England.
[02:41:34.994 --> 02:41:38.557]  They're pumping up their balloon from England.
[02:41:38.557 --> 02:41:39.838]  And this is all they got.
[02:41:39.838 --> 02:41:40.419]  100,000 plus people here.
[02:41:43.061 --> 02:41:47.765]  And here they are, literally over here with no one.
[02:41:47.765 --> 02:41:51.508]  There's only two of us because the rest of us are voting.
[02:41:51.508 --> 02:42:06.581]  Oh yeah, with all your illegal aliens you get to vote, and I'm gonna get you over the top with all them absentee ballots, and we're arresting Democrats all over the state trying to illegally vote.
[02:42:06.581 --> 02:42:08.743]  There's the gut flexor.
[02:42:08.743 --> 02:42:10.545]  So full screen gut flexor.
[02:42:12.761 --> 02:42:19.567]  Look at these people, they all look like escapees from mental institutions.
[02:42:19.567 --> 02:42:24.071]  Not one of them looks like they are not insane.
[02:42:24.071 --> 02:42:27.154]  Travers, the Veto voter.
[02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:30.630]  Hold on a second.
[02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:33.072]  Cruz wants to stop abortions, ma'am.
[02:42:33.072 --> 02:42:34.052]  I'm sorry?
[02:42:34.052 --> 02:42:35.293]  Cruz wants to stop abortions.
[02:42:35.293 --> 02:42:35.613]  He does?
[02:42:35.613 --> 02:42:35.733]  Yeah.
[02:42:35.733 --> 02:42:36.413]  How does that happen?
[02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:39.695]  Well, you say Cruz is a death eater, but he wants to stop babies from being killed in the womb.
[02:42:39.695 --> 02:42:41.076]  All right, we've got to come back with the rest of this.
[02:42:41.076 --> 02:42:44.437]  Because I just wanted the video because I know he said he was going to rape me a bunch.
[02:42:44.437 --> 02:42:45.158]  I guess it's coming up.
[02:42:45.158 --> 02:42:48.099]  Maybe I don't want to watch it, but it's going to be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:42:48.099 --> 02:42:49.020]  That guy's so crazy.
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:51.221]  I boo to you.
[02:42:51.221 --> 02:42:52.001]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:52.001 --> 02:42:53.062]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:42:55.287 --> 02:43:05.875]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.875 --> 02:43:07.937]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:43:07.937 --> 02:43:10.819]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.819 --> 02:43:12.300]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:15.423]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:43:15.663 --> 02:43:19.105]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.105 --> 02:43:21.186]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.186 --> 02:43:30.911]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.911 --> 02:43:43.457]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:43:43.677 --> 02:43:47.699]  Reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:45:13.638 --> 02:45:16.780]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[02:46:58.775 --> 02:47:01.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:38.305 --> 02:47:39.666]  You know, I was singing that earlier.
[02:47:39.666 --> 02:47:41.126]  I forget who sings it.
[02:47:41.126 --> 02:47:42.387]  Is it Wu-Tang Clan or something?
[02:47:42.387 --> 02:47:44.188]  And then they already had that made?
[02:47:44.188 --> 02:47:48.509]  Those are some talented people.
[02:47:48.509 --> 02:47:57.213]  All I know is we had the perfect image coming in to the Alex Jones remix of... That's some big ol' juicy booty right there.
[02:47:57.213 --> 02:48:02.235]  That's the equivalent of like a five-layer all-beef patty.
[02:48:02.235 --> 02:48:04.276]  American cheese.
[02:48:04.276 --> 02:48:06.117]  Dripping with cheese.
[02:48:06.117 --> 02:48:07.238]  Please don't say dripping again.
[02:48:13.014 --> 02:48:14.935]  It's not healthy, Alex.
[02:48:14.935 --> 02:48:18.316]  You indulge on that too much, you're going to have a heart attack and die early.
[02:48:18.316 --> 02:48:22.478]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[02:48:22.478 --> 02:48:23.018]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:23.018 --> 02:48:23.879]  Your heart's going to give out.
[02:48:23.879 --> 02:48:24.759]  Is there something wrong with me?
[02:48:24.759 --> 02:48:25.619]  That kind of looks good.
[02:48:25.619 --> 02:48:26.280]  Okay.
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:26.960]  Hey, hey, hey.
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:27.540]  Don't say.
[02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:28.321]  I'm right there now.
[02:48:28.321 --> 02:48:28.901]  No, no, it's okay.
[02:48:28.901 --> 02:48:30.962]  She can go do that, but I make a joke about it, I'm back.
[02:48:31.912 --> 02:48:34.974]  And don't make a meme about it either, because then it'll be banned in Europe.
[02:48:34.974 --> 02:48:35.695]  That's how they do it.
[02:48:35.695 --> 02:48:38.477]  Big ol' five patty all beef.
[02:48:38.477 --> 02:48:39.878]  They should bring back the Whataburger guy.
[02:48:39.878 --> 02:48:40.499]  Did you ever hear him?
[02:48:40.499 --> 02:48:52.027]  You weren't from Texas then, but his Whataburger's only in Texas, few other states, but he's like, all beef patties, American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, ketchup, jalapenos on a toasted bun.
[02:48:52.027 --> 02:48:55.290]  Now that's what I call a Whataburger.
[02:48:57.329 --> 02:48:59.311]  Sounds like Rip Torn does the voiceover.
[02:48:59.311 --> 02:49:00.692]  Oh my gosh.
[02:49:00.692 --> 02:49:10.879]  All beef patties dripping with cheese, sesame seed bun, a pint of large delicious Coca-Cola, or maybe Dr. Pepper.
[02:49:10.879 --> 02:49:15.923]  There's thousands of ways to get your Whataburger juiciness just like you like it.
[02:49:15.923 --> 02:49:18.365]  Whataburger, baby.
[02:49:18.365 --> 02:49:19.626]  Made in Houston, Texas.
[02:49:19.626 --> 02:49:22.408]  That's the Whataburger booty right there.
[02:49:22.408 --> 02:49:23.429]  Oh my gosh.
[02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:24.149]  Anyway, anyway.
[02:49:24.149 --> 02:49:25.911]  I don't know why I'm in such a good mood today.
[02:49:27.213 --> 02:49:28.394]  Let's get serious.
[02:49:28.394 --> 02:49:33.617]  You have something really big coming up Monday, the day before the election, here in the ATX.
[02:49:33.617 --> 02:49:35.638]  I think other people should do around the country.
[02:49:35.638 --> 02:49:41.581]  We also have hundreds of, veto is a pedo, which is, you know, whatever that means.
[02:49:41.581 --> 02:49:44.323]  You can call himself a pedo, I'd say he identifies as a pedo.
[02:49:44.323 --> 02:49:46.144]  I don't say literally one, he just looks like one.
[02:49:46.144 --> 02:49:47.724]  Most Democrats do look like them.
[02:49:47.724 --> 02:49:49.065]  And we know that's kind of their pastime.
[02:49:49.065 --> 02:49:51.086]  We also have veto for gun confiscation.
[02:49:51.086 --> 02:49:51.907]  What are the other signs we have?
[02:49:53.577 --> 02:49:56.722]  I think there's a veto for NAMBLA, I think, that I've seen.
[02:49:56.722 --> 02:49:59.807]  I think those are the... The Democrats do support NAMBLA, so...
[02:50:00.796 --> 02:50:04.497]  But, you know, the big one that's going to cost him the election is obviously he does want to take the guns.
[02:50:04.497 --> 02:50:05.157]  Yeah, that's real.
[02:50:05.157 --> 02:50:07.118]  It doesn't matter how much he flip-flops on that.
[02:50:07.118 --> 02:50:08.279]  He has pointed ears.
[02:50:08.279 --> 02:50:12.100]  No, I'm telling you, the guy just has... He looks like an evil elf or something.
[02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:16.041]  He just has a creeper aura, just kind of a creeper presence.
[02:50:16.041 --> 02:50:18.982]  And, you know, Texas knows it, and it's fine.
[02:50:18.982 --> 02:50:20.703]  And that's why it's mostly creepers.
[02:50:20.703 --> 02:50:25.004]  But he talks in that voice like Obama, so he must be real smart.
[02:50:25.004 --> 02:50:27.125]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:50:27.853 --> 02:50:35.316]  But the truth is, Alex, with six days left until the midterms, people do need to do everything they can to, you know, make sure Democrats don't get into power.
[02:50:35.316 --> 02:50:36.437]  I mean, that's really what this is all about.
[02:50:36.437 --> 02:50:39.118]  He wants to molest our Second Amendment and First Amendment and our borders.
[02:50:40.094 --> 02:50:42.136]  And our, you know, our paychecks.
[02:50:42.136 --> 02:50:43.977]  So tell us what you're doing Monday.
[02:50:43.977 --> 02:50:48.321]  So here's why it's so important for me to come on to the Alex Jones Show and talk about this, because guess what?
[02:50:48.321 --> 02:50:55.227]  The Infowars Army is banned from Twitter, which is where we used to organize and I could reach out to other people and I'd contact, so they banned us.
[02:50:55.227 --> 02:50:56.108]  We did some great stuff.
[02:50:56.108 --> 02:50:57.129]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:57.129 --> 02:50:59.411]  People go to Infowarsarmy.com.
[02:50:59.571 --> 02:51:03.213]  Yes, yes, and that's where we upload the videos that we do, which we'll be doing on Monday.
[02:51:03.213 --> 02:51:05.934]  So here's the deal for Monday in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:05.934 --> 02:51:08.436]  I'm calling out any info warriors here in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:08.436 --> 02:51:14.819]  We're going to do a sign hold above a major bridge over Highway 35 in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:14.819 --> 02:51:21.763]  Now I'm not going to give out the exact location of the bridge, because we don't need a bunch of rabid leftists coming out and assaulting us.
[02:51:21.763 --> 02:51:23.344]  I'd rather avoid that.
[02:51:23.344 --> 02:51:27.006]  But, so I will announce the official location of the bridge.
[02:51:28.047 --> 02:51:31.752]  Maybe, maybe Friday, maybe Monday, just we'll see how many people respond to this.
[02:51:31.752 --> 02:51:39.021]  But Monday at 5.30 on a bridge in Austin, Texas over Highway 35, I've got 10 signs.
[02:51:39.021 --> 02:51:45.048]  They say record GDP growth under Trump, record job growth under Trump, record low unemployment under Trump.
[02:51:45.890 --> 02:51:50.055]  Vote Red, vote Dem out, and then others that say Infowars.com banned information.
[02:51:50.055 --> 02:51:53.360]  So, I'm calling on people to join me, hold these signs.
[02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:54.582]  They're huge signs.
[02:51:54.582 --> 02:51:55.924]  We hold them over the bridge.
[02:51:55.924 --> 02:51:59.709]  Thousands and thousands of people will see them stuck in rush hour traffic.
[02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:01.812]  And it's an act of rebellion in the third dimension.
[02:52:01.932 --> 02:52:02.392]  Exactly.
[02:52:02.392 --> 02:52:06.316]  So if they want to ban us in the digital world, which I'm kind of glad.
[02:52:06.316 --> 02:52:07.857]  I don't really like the digital world anyway.
[02:52:07.857 --> 02:52:11.100]  Obviously, it has its advantages for marketing and sharing content.
[02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:12.221]  You have to put it there.
[02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:13.241]  That's the mainstream.
[02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:16.224]  That's the big... But where it really happens is on the ground.
[02:52:16.224 --> 02:52:17.325]  And it is powerful.
[02:52:17.325 --> 02:52:18.546]  And then you get to meet people.
[02:52:18.546 --> 02:52:20.748]  I mean, you see Whataburger butt in the real world, not...
[02:52:21.528 --> 02:52:25.150]  Well, you see Whataburger, but in the real world, you just, you never look back.
[02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:27.512]  And that's an image you can't really forget, unfortunately, either.
[02:52:27.512 --> 02:52:33.455]  But the point is, this Monday, I'm calling on all InfoWarriors in Austin, Texas.
[02:52:33.455 --> 02:52:38.118]  I know a lot of you are going to hear this on this show, because you listen every day, to reach out to me.
[02:52:38.118 --> 02:52:39.538]  I know that we've been in touch before.
[02:52:39.538 --> 02:52:45.802]  Shoot me a message in whatever capability, whether it's my email, whether you can just
[02:52:46.122 --> 02:52:52.507]  Get in touch with me on, uh, I do have my Twitter account, they haven't banned me personally yet, so you can shoot me a tweet there too, and I will see, and I will respond.
[02:52:52.507 --> 02:52:53.388]  Tell folks about your evil Twitter.
[02:52:53.388 --> 02:52:58.872]  It's at, all I do is Owen, it's probably gonna be banned soon, I did tweet out that I'm gonna have a bridge sign hold on Monday.
[02:52:58.872 --> 02:52:59.893]  Yeah, booty brain!
[02:52:59.893 --> 02:53:03.376]  So, it's even risky for us to even tweet these days, you know, they try to ban us.
[02:53:03.376 --> 02:53:06.719]  But we're not gonna comply with them, we're gonna communicate, we're evil, we're bad.
[02:53:06.719 --> 02:53:09.221]  The point is, it's gonna, and maybe I'll show up out there.
[02:53:10.451 --> 02:53:15.755]  Well last time I did this it was pouring rain and we still had 15 people show up in the pouring soaking rain.
[02:53:15.755 --> 02:53:18.777]  And it's badass and we'll take photos of it and project it out there and then I gotta go.
[02:53:18.777 --> 02:53:19.797]  Is early voting closed yet?
[02:53:19.797 --> 02:53:20.578]  I gotta go vote.
[02:53:20.578 --> 02:53:22.499]  I think early voting is actually closed.
[02:53:22.499 --> 02:53:23.400]  We're all gonna go vote too.
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:24.120]  I'm not positive.
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:24.941]  You ready to vote now?
[02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:25.721]  Yeah, oh yeah, I'm good.
[02:53:25.721 --> 02:53:26.262]  I'm good.
[02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:27.162]  Well let's all go together.
[02:53:27.162 --> 02:53:27.923]  I'm gonna go as a gay front.
[02:53:29.111 --> 02:53:33.716]  As long as you don't make a political message within 200 yards of the polling station, you are okay.
[02:53:33.716 --> 02:53:36.880]  And I think if you go as a gay frog, I think that that's not a political message.
[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:40.083]  I think that that's... I think that that's just what you identify as.
[02:53:40.083 --> 02:53:42.546]  I support Atraffin sterilizing me.
[02:53:42.546 --> 02:53:48.993]  No, but you... See, the key is you have to say you identify as a gay frog on the gender spectrum.
[02:53:48.993 --> 02:53:49.714]  And then it's official.
[02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:53.991]  All right, let's get serious.
[02:53:53.991 --> 02:54:00.873]  Roger Stone has galactic-level information coming up in the next hour.
[02:54:00.873 --> 02:54:11.776]  And then we're going to have the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m., and there's going to be a spectacular visit from not just Gay Frog, but from Atrazine Man.
[02:54:12.890 --> 02:54:17.591]  I haven't figured out the name of it yet, but Gay Frog is going to interview Atrazine Man.
[02:54:17.591 --> 02:54:18.672]  I think it's Atrazine Man.
[02:54:18.672 --> 02:54:20.432]  I think he's floating around, actually.
[02:54:20.432 --> 02:54:22.353]  There's no need to fear!
[02:54:22.353 --> 02:54:23.913]  Atrazine Man is here!
[02:54:23.913 --> 02:54:26.454]  Mr. Atrazine Man!
[02:54:26.454 --> 02:54:27.955]  What are you doing to the frogs?
[02:54:27.955 --> 02:54:28.775]  It's wonderful!
[02:54:28.775 --> 02:54:31.136]  I've got four eyeballs and two heads!
[02:54:31.136 --> 02:54:32.416]  And I'm sterile!
[02:54:32.416 --> 02:54:34.937]  And I like other boy frogs!
[02:54:34.937 --> 02:54:36.157]  Good!
[02:54:36.157 --> 02:54:37.077]  You're dead now!
[02:54:37.077 --> 02:54:39.858]  That's my gift to you, Mr. Gay Frog!
[02:54:39.858 --> 02:54:41.559]  Now, go away and die!
[02:54:41.559 --> 02:54:42.319]  Thank you, Daddy!
[02:54:42.884 --> 02:54:48.048]  I hear if you kiss a gay frog, you turn into Brian Stelter.
[02:54:48.048 --> 02:54:55.654]  Well, the good part about the now that I've become a gay frog is that now I can get on a grinder and I can hook up with Brian Stelter.
[02:54:55.654 --> 02:54:59.597]  Oh, that's that's been what's keeping you off.
[02:54:59.597 --> 02:55:01.278]  Oh, look, I'm into women.
[02:55:01.278 --> 02:55:04.400]  I got four kids, but Brian Stelter is too hot, man.
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.282]  OK, and I just I got to do it.
[02:55:08.010 --> 02:55:09.211]  It's like when he backs up.
[02:55:09.211 --> 02:55:12.572]  Imagine he gets on his knees, when he backs up, it sounds like a trash truck backing up.
[02:55:12.572 --> 02:55:15.093]  Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[02:55:15.093 --> 02:55:18.695]  Hold on Alex, let's start vomiting.
[02:55:18.695 --> 02:55:19.275]  Let's be real.
[02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:22.057]  He looks like an escapee from a mental institution.
[02:55:22.057 --> 02:55:22.657]  They all do.
[02:55:23.713 --> 02:55:26.834]  I mean, if you saw that guy, you would never let him babysit your kid.
[02:55:26.834 --> 02:55:30.616]  He looks like the guy in Prometheus after he has that alien bug.
[02:55:30.616 --> 02:55:33.517]  You know, Alex, let's just come out here.
[02:55:33.517 --> 02:55:35.017]  Hello, children.
[02:55:35.017 --> 02:55:37.378]  I've got free ice cream and puppies.
[02:55:37.378 --> 02:55:39.039]  Just get in the back of the white van.
[02:55:39.039 --> 02:55:41.320]  Look at that.
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:42.881]  Look at him.
[02:55:42.881 --> 02:55:49.123]  You offered Brian Seltzer a million dollars to Bare Knuckle Box just because you have a crush on him.
[02:55:50.953 --> 02:55:51.853]  Just a minute, it's fine.
[02:55:51.853 --> 02:55:55.015]  You, you, Brian Stelter... I'm coming out of the closet.
[02:55:55.015 --> 02:55:57.136]  No, you know, this isn't a joke.
[02:55:57.136 --> 02:55:59.997]  I apologize, Brian Stelter.
[02:55:59.997 --> 02:56:02.338]  I have, I've been obsessed with you because you're so sexy.
[02:56:02.338 --> 02:56:05.179]  And you're so manly.
[02:56:05.179 --> 02:56:06.519]  Hold on.
[02:56:06.519 --> 02:56:10.421]  It's okay.
[02:56:10.421 --> 02:56:11.681]  Ribbit.
[02:56:11.681 --> 02:56:13.262]  No, Owen, you laugh about this.
[02:56:13.262 --> 02:56:14.363]  I'm gonna be honest right now, people.
[02:56:17.850 --> 02:56:19.371]  And see, I'm already getting in my gay frog mode.
[02:56:19.371 --> 02:56:22.513]  Okay, we're on a lot of Christian stations, it's Halloween, I'm joking around a little bit.
[02:56:22.513 --> 02:56:24.914]  I'm obviously not a gay frog!
[02:56:24.914 --> 02:56:26.895]  I'm a performance artist, they said so!
[02:56:26.895 --> 02:56:40.542]  The truth is, I feel the country energizing, I feel a red wave, I'm worried about the caravan, but everything they're doing is turning to crap, and Bolsonaro winning, and Merkel being out, and everything, it's just really good.
[02:56:40.542 --> 02:56:41.603]  This is a global delay getting going.
[02:56:42.045 --> 02:56:45.007]  Well, it really is a roller coaster, though, every day almost, Alex.
[02:56:45.007 --> 02:56:56.397]  Just the ups and downs in the news and the media and, you know, the attacks against Trump, the attacks against us, the censorship, but then the victories, hundreds of thousands at a Trump rally, more patriots coming together nationwide.
[02:56:56.397 --> 02:56:58.419]  So it's just like, you know, it's the ebbs and flows.
[02:56:58.419 --> 02:57:03.303]  And on Halloween, you know, it's all spirits' eve, it's all souls' eve.
[02:57:03.303 --> 02:57:06.285]  So there's going to be, you know, there's going to be a little paranormal, I think, out there.
[02:57:06.285 --> 02:57:07.146]  And if it happens to be
[02:57:08.291 --> 02:57:10.132]  The Atrazine Man, then.
[02:57:10.132 --> 02:57:13.552]  The Atrazine Man is what it will be.
[02:57:13.552 --> 02:57:20.094]  But if it's Brian Stelter refusing a million dollars to charity because he won't bare-knuckle box you, I think it's because he's homophobic.
[02:57:20.094 --> 02:57:22.835]  You know, with me it's all talks.
[02:57:22.835 --> 02:57:24.596]  Brian Stelter would just crush me.
[02:57:24.596 --> 02:57:24.936]  That's true.
[02:57:24.936 --> 02:57:25.416]  That's true.
[02:57:25.416 --> 02:57:26.036]  Or Oliver Brunson.
[02:57:31.115 --> 02:57:32.757]  Or Oliver Darcy, he's a real tough guy.
[02:57:32.757 --> 02:57:35.539]  Oh my God, Oliver Darcy would mop the floor with that guy.
[02:57:35.539 --> 02:57:37.561]  One, just, he'd throw a right kick up.
[02:57:37.561 --> 02:57:38.382]  Actually, I'm shocked.
[02:57:38.382 --> 02:57:40.264]  He'd kick my head off my shoulders.
[02:57:40.264 --> 02:57:41.525]  How is he not a boxing champion?
[02:57:41.525 --> 02:57:43.347]  He already slaughtered the First Amendment, America.
[02:57:43.347 --> 02:57:45.408]  I mean, quite frankly, he's a devastator.
[02:57:45.408 --> 02:57:53.796]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:54.257]  Believe me.
[02:57:54.617 --> 02:57:55.238]  I know.
[02:57:55.238 --> 02:57:59.942]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:57:59.942 --> 02:58:05.186]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:58:05.186 --> 02:58:19.418]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[02:58:19.778 --> 02:58:25.843]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:58:25.843 --> 02:58:29.806]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:58:29.806 --> 02:58:33.529]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:58:33.529 --> 02:58:38.513]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:58:38.513 --> 02:58:41.256]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:58:41.256 --> 02:58:43.678]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:46.593 --> 02:58:50.837]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.837 --> 02:58:54.320]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.082]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:56.082 --> 02:58:59.365]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.365 --> 02:59:06.151]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.151 --> 02:59:11.216]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:11.556 --> 02:59:17.659]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.659 --> 02:59:20.640]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:21.740]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.740 --> 02:59:25.562]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.562 --> 02:59:27.583]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.583 --> 02:59:28.884]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.884 --> 02:59:31.605]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.605 --> 02:59:34.026]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.526 --> 02:59:35.667]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.667 --> 02:59:38.168]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.168 --> 02:59:39.128]  I physically will.
[02:59:39.128 --> 02:59:49.813]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWars4.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.813 --> 02:59:52.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.543 --> 03:00:10.528]  You just joined us, you're a regular, so we're showing you a beautiful Democratic Party family album.
[03:00:10.528 --> 03:00:11.748]  Rapists that are undead.
[03:00:11.748 --> 03:00:18.092]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:18.092 --> 03:00:24.896]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:32.312 --> 03:00:38.714]  Alright, you know, I don't normally get one of these little giddy moods today, but I just... I don't know what's wrong with me.
[03:00:38.714 --> 03:00:39.774]  I've been in a good mood all day.
[03:00:39.774 --> 03:00:40.375]  That's terrible.
[03:00:40.375 --> 03:00:41.995]  I'm usually in a horrible, angry mood.
[03:00:41.995 --> 03:00:45.616]  Oh, and what am I going to do?
[03:00:45.616 --> 03:00:50.578]  It's good for your health to be able to kind of have some gallows humor in the midst of all this craziness.
[03:00:50.578 --> 03:00:51.998]  Like Atrazine was good for that frog?
[03:00:51.998 --> 03:00:52.599]  It is Halloween.
[03:00:52.599 --> 03:00:54.879]  This is the posthumous gay frog right here.
[03:00:54.879 --> 03:00:56.200]  We're paying our respects today.
[03:00:57.426 --> 03:01:07.615]  But the truth of the matter is, you'll drive yourself crazy if you can't just have a laugh once in a while, and just make light of all the nastiness and the hate out there.
[03:01:07.615 --> 03:01:08.275]  Comedy is comedy.
[03:01:08.275 --> 03:01:08.656]  I agree.
[03:01:08.656 --> 03:01:10.037]  You know, we've covered a lot of news.
[03:01:10.037 --> 03:01:14.561]  There's a lot of breaking news at newswars.com and drugreport.com, and I haven't looked at the news in like 30 minutes.
[03:01:14.561 --> 03:01:16.062]  I bet there's something huge breaking.
[03:01:16.062 --> 03:01:19.545]  I've got so many articles I can't even cover them all, but let's go to drugreport.com right now.
[03:01:19.545 --> 03:01:21.006]  Poor Roger Stone has big breaking news.
[03:01:21.006 --> 03:01:23.989]  Let's put it up and see what the big news is there at this point.
[03:01:23.989 --> 03:01:25.070]  Can you guys put that on screen for me?
[03:01:26.530 --> 03:01:27.831]  Drum roll.
[03:01:27.831 --> 03:01:34.915]  There you go.
[03:01:34.915 --> 03:01:35.655]  Trick or treat.
[03:01:35.655 --> 03:01:36.436]  Yeah, it's been up.
[03:01:36.436 --> 03:01:37.957]  Has Mueller subpoenaed the president?
[03:01:37.957 --> 03:01:40.038]  We'll find out next time at Roger Stone.
[03:01:40.038 --> 03:01:43.340]  Oprah Winfrey's out trying to get that racist lady elected in Georgia.
[03:01:44.671 --> 03:01:46.432]  I mean, who cares about Oprah Winfrey?
[03:01:46.432 --> 03:01:50.213]  I don't think Hollywood's figured out, like, people are sick of celebrities.
[03:01:50.213 --> 03:01:53.795]  Unless they're the dumbest, I don't know, like, housewives, maybe?
[03:01:53.795 --> 03:01:54.715]  Nah.
[03:01:54.715 --> 03:02:00.557]  Well, I mean, no one I know, like, if you even talk about celebrities and stuff, everybody's like, ugh!
[03:02:00.557 --> 03:02:02.778]  And it's not just like, oh, they're jealous of their celebrities.
[03:02:02.778 --> 03:02:04.279]  They're sick of it.
[03:02:04.279 --> 03:02:12.062]  It really is, like, bitter people, I think, is really the ones that are attracted to the celebrity nature of a political
[03:02:12.822 --> 03:02:16.743]  Propaganda, whatever, where Oprah wants to campaign for this woman.
[03:02:16.743 --> 03:02:20.204]  No, Alex, most people see Oprah campaigning and that turns them off.
[03:02:20.204 --> 03:02:22.605]  Most people see Barack Obama campaigning.
[03:02:22.605 --> 03:02:24.505]  That turns them off.
[03:02:24.505 --> 03:02:26.466]  So, they haven't got it yet.
[03:02:26.466 --> 03:02:34.988]  The same people that they've been using to get their agendas through, that have usually been massively popular in the past, and Obama and Oprah, you know, a Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:02:34.988 --> 03:02:37.649]  Well, notice how Hillary trial balloons running for president again.
[03:02:38.416 --> 03:02:41.899]  Well, she's... she wants to run.
[03:02:41.899 --> 03:02:44.522]  I mean, if she's alive, she'll run.
[03:02:44.522 --> 03:02:48.846]  I really think so.
[03:02:48.846 --> 03:02:52.510]  Who could challenge the Golden Code?
[03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:53.230]  No one.
[03:02:53.230 --> 03:02:55.973]  Maybe Michael Bloomberg, but probably no one.
[03:02:59.448 --> 03:03:01.510]  We could ask Roger Stone that question when we come back.
[03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:03.131]  We should have opened the phones up today.
[03:03:03.131 --> 03:03:04.712]  Tomorrow, I promise, open phones the entire time.
[03:03:04.712 --> 03:03:06.934]  We'll take some phone calls on the War Room today.
[03:03:06.934 --> 03:03:11.057]  War Room coming up with you in about 55 minutes.
[03:03:11.057 --> 03:03:22.447]  You know, I didn't drop the ball today, but just, New X3 is so good that I'm sitting here reading what it does, and it sounds like hype, and I almost get embarrassed.
[03:03:22.447 --> 03:03:24.608]  But, it's true.
[03:03:24.608 --> 03:03:25.829]  I mean, if you don't have iodine,
[03:03:27.119 --> 03:03:31.802]  In your body, you leave this plane of existence.
[03:03:31.802 --> 03:03:35.225]  And everything they do is to target it and suppress it.
[03:03:35.225 --> 03:03:39.248]  And so in our quest to get new deep-earth crystals, we found a new supplier.
[03:03:40.789 --> 03:03:48.772]  Then we talked to the top chemists and they said you need to add the other two small amounts, a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize and last longer and is uploaded better.
[03:03:48.772 --> 03:03:50.053]  We did research, we did it.
[03:03:50.053 --> 03:03:51.533]  It's over a year in the making.
[03:03:51.533 --> 03:03:54.214]  Our big secret weapon, because they try to cut suppliers off.
[03:03:54.214 --> 03:03:56.355]  So I had to get the deal done six months ago.
[03:03:56.355 --> 03:04:01.537]  I had to sign a long-term contract, a five-year contract, to be able to get this.
[03:04:01.537 --> 03:04:08.379]  Oil companies just don't get this, you know, in their process, even though it's worth a lot of money and it's used industrially as a controlled substance.
[03:04:08.379 --> 03:04:09.660]  Not once we send it out.
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:16.788]  It's been aerosolized in a patented process, but the Deep Earth Crystal is a controlled substance.
[03:04:16.788 --> 03:04:19.771]  It's a precursor to everything, basically.
[03:04:19.771 --> 03:04:21.594]  It's a very active element.
[03:04:22.782 --> 03:04:24.984]  And then now it's even better than X2.
[03:04:24.984 --> 03:04:28.066]  You look at the bottle and it says it isn't as strong.
[03:04:28.066 --> 03:04:29.827]  And that's because you measure each one differently.
[03:04:29.827 --> 03:04:30.747]  We can make it as strong as we want to.
[03:04:30.747 --> 03:04:31.888]  It's not about the cost.
[03:04:31.888 --> 03:04:35.090]  It's about what the FDA says is seen as safe.
[03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:36.911]  Use less.
[03:04:36.911 --> 03:04:37.732]  Use whatever you think.
[03:04:37.732 --> 03:04:38.432]  Use more.
[03:04:38.432 --> 03:04:39.733]  That's up to you.
[03:04:39.733 --> 03:04:40.574]  Use responsibly.
[03:04:40.574 --> 03:04:43.356]  It's a powerful element that they don't want you to have.
[03:04:43.356 --> 03:04:46.818]  Gee, they might want to get it and fund the revolution to defeat the globalists.
[03:04:46.818 --> 03:04:47.939]  A super win-win.
[03:04:47.939 --> 03:04:49.840]  Only a maniac idiot wouldn't do that.
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:50.921]  X3 at m4wrestore.com.

[03:05:48.466 --> 03:05:58.790]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:58.790 --> 03:06:09.795]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.166 --> 03:06:43.488]  My God, we thought we were showing you footage of the big black guy threatening to rape me and kill me.
[03:06:43.488 --> 03:06:45.409]  But I'm bullhorning over it, so it's not that good.
[03:06:45.409 --> 03:06:47.470]  No wonder the crew never put it out weeks ago.
[03:06:47.470 --> 03:06:50.251]  I just said, I was there, put that video out.
[03:06:50.251 --> 03:06:58.175]  But somebody just sent Owen HD footage of him later saying, I'm gonna murder people and hack them up and put them in the backs of trucks.
[03:06:58.175 --> 03:07:00.516]  And I'm gonna rape everybody.
[03:07:00.516 --> 03:07:04.518]  Now, the problem is there's so much cussing that he just ran off to go try to get it bleeped.
[03:07:06.736 --> 03:07:11.460]  We got hours of this, and we're just so busy we never even put it out.
[03:07:11.460 --> 03:07:12.441]  But that's how it works.
[03:07:12.441 --> 03:07:13.662]  I play the crappy version.
[03:07:13.662 --> 03:07:16.205]  The crew goes, okay, we'll do whatever you say.
[03:07:16.205 --> 03:07:16.845]  They put it out.
[03:07:16.845 --> 03:07:20.068]  You can barely hear what he's saying because I'm yelling back at him.
[03:07:20.068 --> 03:07:28.576]  But now we have crisp HD when I'm not there of him talking about murdering everyone, how he's going to hack Republicans up and put them in the backs of trucks.
[03:07:29.810 --> 03:07:31.812]  Now, Roger Stone's got huge news.
[03:07:31.812 --> 03:07:34.354]  It's breaking right now.
[03:07:34.354 --> 03:07:38.277]  Because, again, this whole Mueller thing is what they've bet their hold.
[03:07:38.277 --> 03:07:40.139]  The election's illegitimate.
[03:07:40.139 --> 03:07:41.279]  Trump's illegitimate.
[03:07:41.279 --> 03:07:44.002]  And now they go, oh, it's process.
[03:07:44.002 --> 03:07:45.563]  Did Trump perjure himself?
[03:07:45.563 --> 03:07:46.504]  We're going to look at all that.
[03:07:46.504 --> 03:07:49.967]  But first, since we mentioned this, there's a bunch of clips I didn't get to on the show.
[03:07:51.716 --> 03:08:02.523]  One of my dead, even though I've got like 50 clips, is Don Lemon in three different clips saying white people are inherently evil and that white males are the problem on the earth.
[03:08:02.523 --> 03:08:15.592]  Now this has been taught for decades at universities by weird white professors trying to create identity politics of minorities so they never experience the American dream and are their chip on their shoulder losers who are then mainlined in the prisons.
[03:08:16.824 --> 03:08:24.429]  And the real social engineers have it set up in the prisons to turn blacks and whites and everybody into racists once you get there to control you.
[03:08:24.429 --> 03:08:27.631]  But I wanted to get Roger Stone's take on this because this is next level.
[03:08:27.631 --> 03:08:35.496]  The New York Times ran a similar article saying whites are inherently evil, they need to die out for us to have a better world.
[03:08:35.496 --> 03:08:37.498]  But everybody wants to get into Western countries.
[03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:47.761]  And I'm not saying whites are better than anybody, but there's been major studies done, even by the Japanese and the Russians and others, and there's African professors that have noted this.
[03:08:48.917 --> 03:08:57.439]  Equatorial populations tend to not be too worried about long-term preparedness because hurricanes come by, typhoons, there's plenty of food.
[03:08:57.439 --> 03:09:02.280]  The big problem is you have a bunch of babies, the neighboring island comes over and tries to kill you.
[03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:03.581]  Overpopulation is generally the deal.
[03:09:03.581 --> 03:09:05.321]  You have wars that keep that down.
[03:09:05.321 --> 03:09:06.601]  When you had an ice age for 15,000 years or so,
[03:09:09.212 --> 03:09:11.953]  There was only, you know, a few hours a day you could go out.
[03:09:11.953 --> 03:09:17.176]  If you didn't organize and you weren't time sensitive, everybody knows about Northern Europeans' neuroses about time.
[03:09:17.176 --> 03:09:18.756]  Trains are all on time.
[03:09:18.756 --> 03:09:20.297]  You die.
[03:09:20.297 --> 03:09:29.562]  And so, as you go higher, whether it's Asian or white or whatever it is, the preparedness, the science, the math IQ goes up.
[03:09:29.562 --> 03:09:31.082]  The worse your environment's at.
[03:09:31.082 --> 03:09:34.204]  Like, if you grew up on Mars, I bet you'd be real smart or you'd be dead.
[03:09:35.143 --> 03:09:44.340]  So that's why the West is so horrible, but everyone wants to get here, and then the West has this guilt, so it's killing itself with a bunch of globalists manipulating it.
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:46.464]  But I'm going to play this clip and get Roger Stone's take.
[03:09:46.464 --> 03:09:46.724]  Here it is.
[03:09:47.506 --> 03:09:58.995]  We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized up to the right.
[03:09:58.995 --> 03:10:00.877]  And we have to start doing something about them.
[03:10:00.877 --> 03:10:04.059]  There is no travel ban on them.
[03:10:04.059 --> 03:10:06.421]  There is no ban on, you know, the Muslim ban.
[03:10:06.421 --> 03:10:08.263]  There is no white guy ban.
[03:10:08.263 --> 03:10:09.364]  So what do we do about that?
[03:10:09.935 --> 03:10:19.218]  Okay, so Gavin McGinnis, who I really agree with on almost everything, said, well yeah, even though whites are aged below 40 or minority above that, you know, 75% of the country is white.
[03:10:19.218 --> 03:10:21.578]  That's not actually totally accurate.
[03:10:21.578 --> 03:10:31.021]  But the real FBI statistics are, after Asians, whites are the lowest crime rate group, veterans and conservatives are the lowest crime rate group, period.
[03:10:31.021 --> 03:10:38.343]  So the idea that because some national socialist jerk-off, piece of crap,
[03:10:39.972 --> 03:10:46.221]  Went in and did this horrible heinous crime to these poor people.
[03:10:47.714 --> 03:10:52.215]  The idea that that's now all white males are guilty is the most racist thing I've ever heard.
[03:10:52.215 --> 03:10:55.597]  Roger Stone, what do you think about that before your big breaking news?
[03:10:55.597 --> 03:10:56.877]  I totally agree with you, Alex.
[03:10:56.877 --> 03:11:00.378]  This is the fault line in American politics.
[03:11:00.378 --> 03:11:08.240]  The fact that one horrific act by one person is now being blamed on an entire race of people is absurd.
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:12.382]  The crime statistics kept by the FBI disprove that.
[03:11:12.382 --> 03:11:15.843]  I guess my question to Don Lemon would be, what about Antifa?
[03:11:16.424 --> 03:11:20.955]  What about the thugs that are attacking old people and women in our streets?
[03:11:20.955 --> 03:11:22.177]  But that is actually mainly why.
[03:11:24.112 --> 03:11:27.853]  The point here is that that is a racist absurdity.
[03:11:27.853 --> 03:11:32.135]  The greatest terrorist threat in the country today is not white males.
[03:11:32.135 --> 03:11:37.157]  It is outrageous that the Proud Boys Facebook page was taken down yesterday.
[03:11:37.157 --> 03:11:44.839]  That they have been falsely branded as bigots or as racists or as white supremacists.
[03:11:44.839 --> 03:11:46.940]  I would not associate with such people.
[03:11:46.940 --> 03:11:48.900]  That is a falsehood.
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:50.481]  Let me ask you a serious question.
[03:11:50.481 --> 03:11:52.462]  What is the name of that cat?
[03:11:52.462 --> 03:11:52.882]  Sylvester?
[03:11:53.812 --> 03:11:55.494]  Oh, no, that's actually Oreo.
[03:11:55.494 --> 03:11:57.216]  I apologize for that.
[03:11:57.216 --> 03:11:58.176]  But it is Halloween.
[03:11:58.176 --> 03:11:59.538]  Apologize, bring it over.
[03:11:59.538 --> 03:12:04.683]  He's not very sociable, but it's Halloween, so he's very excited.
[03:12:04.683 --> 03:12:08.306]  Oh, really?
[03:12:08.306 --> 03:12:12.610]  I normally black and white cats, but Oreo is a good name as well.
[03:12:12.610 --> 03:12:14.973]  It looks like that cat's not been missing out on any meals.
[03:12:16.027 --> 03:12:17.328]  That's for sure.
[03:12:17.328 --> 03:12:19.591]  Look, this is like Stone's dog farm.
[03:12:19.591 --> 03:12:22.034]  We have two dogs, three cats.
[03:12:22.034 --> 03:12:25.898]  The three cats were all strays that Mrs. Stone has adopted.
[03:12:25.898 --> 03:12:28.701]  They have different levels of sociability.
[03:12:28.701 --> 03:12:29.982]  One of them's a feral cat.
[03:12:29.982 --> 03:12:31.604]  We know she's starving them.
[03:12:32.906 --> 03:12:34.167]  No, she's feeding them well.
[03:12:34.167 --> 03:12:35.707]  They eat better than I do.
[03:12:35.707 --> 03:12:39.249]  I tell my wife, I'm like, you fill as much food as the cats want.
[03:12:39.249 --> 03:12:39.969]  They're obese.
[03:12:39.969 --> 03:12:41.110]  It's abusive.
[03:12:41.110 --> 03:12:41.570]  Stop it.
[03:12:41.570 --> 03:12:44.451]  She goes, well, they ask for food because they're gluttons.
[03:12:44.451 --> 03:12:45.551]  Throw them outside.
[03:12:45.551 --> 03:12:47.952]  Cats go, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
[03:12:47.952 --> 03:12:49.133]  It's all this gourmet food.
[03:12:49.133 --> 03:12:51.814]  Like, every time I'm like, all you're doing is feeding cats.
[03:12:51.814 --> 03:12:53.875]  The cats are literally Garfield.
[03:12:53.875 --> 03:12:59.217]  It's kind of an analogy for the welfare state and the socialism we engage here in America.
[03:13:00.566 --> 03:13:01.327]  It is, like 5 a.m.
[03:13:01.327 --> 03:13:05.012]  I'll go stumbling into the bathroom and there's the fat cat going, meow, meow.
[03:13:05.012 --> 03:13:06.734]  And they're real nice because they want food.
[03:13:06.734 --> 03:13:07.956]  Occasionally it'll scratch me.
[03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:13.154]  And if I go in the kitchen to get coffee and he wants his food now, he comes up and starts bitching at me.
[03:13:13.154 --> 03:13:13.774]  I'm sorry.
[03:13:13.774 --> 03:13:15.115]  Well, stop talking about cats.
[03:13:15.115 --> 03:13:16.136]  Let's get serious, Roger.
[03:13:16.136 --> 03:13:17.658]  You're taking over your big Russian news in a minute.
[03:13:17.658 --> 03:13:21.061]  But I think we've got a red wave unless the election fraud is just too big.
[03:13:21.061 --> 03:13:32.191]  And the portend we see, the omens, the tea leaves with Bolsonaro and with Merkel out of power, this is really added to Brexit and Italy and everything else.
[03:13:32.191 --> 03:13:33.532]  This is looking really juicy.
[03:13:34.622 --> 03:13:49.488]  Well, the real question is, will the internet censorship of InfoWars and other conservative sites, the taking down of millions of freedom-oriented sites on Facebook, will that be enough to tip the election?
[03:13:51.769 --> 03:13:52.810]  That it is.
[03:13:52.810 --> 03:14:02.194]  All of this internet censorship, with Infowars being the test case, first out of the chute, is based on a desire to affect next Tuesday's elections.
[03:14:02.194 --> 03:14:04.374]  That is the precise point of it.
[03:14:04.374 --> 03:14:15.139]  I'm hoping that there is not enough censorship to push back a red wave, but the Democrats are counting heavily on our inability to communicate based on the
[03:14:15.579 --> 03:14:24.026]  So everybody's got to be energized and take everybody you know to the polls, take grandma, put her in a wheelchair, grandpa, get down there, tell your neighbors, do it!
[03:14:24.026 --> 03:14:27.049]  Push people over the edge nicely, not with threats in your neighborhood.
[03:14:27.049 --> 03:14:27.649]  Get active.
[03:14:27.649 --> 03:14:29.631]  This election is beyond critical.
[03:14:29.631 --> 03:14:31.252]  Roger Stone, you're taking over in just a moment.
[03:14:31.252 --> 03:14:42.322]  Owen, tell people again, Monday you're going to be, they've got to go to your Twitter, they've got to email you at Infowarsarmy.com, you're going to peacefully take over a bridge with huge banner hangs, but you need about 50 people to help do it.
[03:14:42.782 --> 03:14:43.322]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:14:43.322 --> 03:14:53.286]  Email me at InfoWarsArmy and on Monday from 5.30 to 6.30 during rush hour traffic, we're going to hold signs up over the 35 interstate here in Texas.
[03:14:53.286 --> 03:14:55.146]  It's going to have thousands of people driving through.
[03:14:55.146 --> 03:14:56.567]  It's going to be heavy with traffic.
[03:14:56.567 --> 03:14:58.027]  I've got 10 signs.
[03:14:58.027 --> 03:15:03.109]  They say record GDP growth under Trump, record jobs growth, record low unemployment, vote red.
[03:15:03.709 --> 03:15:04.830]  Vote Dem out.
[03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:05.731]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:05.731 --> 03:15:06.532]  Banned information.
[03:15:06.532 --> 03:15:07.553]  So I've got all the signs.
[03:15:07.553 --> 03:15:09.916]  I just need you to help me be there and hold them up.
[03:15:09.916 --> 03:15:11.637]  We're going to have HD cameras out there as well.
[03:15:11.637 --> 03:15:12.518]  We'll do a live stream.
[03:15:12.518 --> 03:15:13.319]  We'll talk to you.
[03:15:13.319 --> 03:15:16.783]  You can talk about why you like Trump or what you see going on.
[03:15:16.783 --> 03:15:17.584]  Share your opinion.
[03:15:17.584 --> 03:15:21.908]  And never forget, especially if you live in the ATX or around here, maybe you can't go.
[03:15:21.908 --> 03:15:23.630]  Tell 20 people they can go.
[03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:25.492]  Just as important as going is telling people.
[03:15:25.772 --> 03:15:30.733]  Or if you're not in Austin and you're somewhere in California or Montana or Illinois... Do your own thing!
[03:15:30.733 --> 03:15:33.834]  Yeah, go to your local InfoWarsArmy.com and post the videos.
[03:15:33.834 --> 03:15:34.834]  And I'm behind a week.
[03:15:34.834 --> 03:15:37.475]  I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow of the great NPC meme.
[03:15:37.475 --> 03:15:39.055]  It's been very successful.
[03:15:39.055 --> 03:15:43.276]  We're going to go to break and we've got the Russian agent.
[03:15:43.276 --> 03:15:43.776]  I'm joking.
[03:15:43.776 --> 03:15:45.257]  We'll say that's an admission.
[03:15:45.257 --> 03:15:47.957]  My comrade, Roger Stone, taking over.
[03:15:47.957 --> 03:15:50.438]  Don't forget, without you spreading the links, we're dead.
[03:15:50.438 --> 03:15:51.258]  Thank you for your support.
[03:15:53.792 --> 03:15:54.993]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.993 --> 03:16:00.377]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.377 --> 03:16:03.279]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.279 --> 03:16:06.861]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:16:06.861 --> 03:16:14.446]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[03:16:14.446 --> 03:16:19.049]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[03:16:19.049 --> 03:16:21.471]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[03:16:21.471 --> 03:16:22.632]  Faketv.com
[03:16:23.413 --> 03:16:29.756]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.756 --> 03:16:32.798]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.798 --> 03:16:38.721]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.721 --> 03:16:42.523]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.523 --> 03:16:43.783]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.783 --> 03:16:45.124]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:45.124 --> 03:16:51.327]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:51.327 --> 03:16:52.748]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.439 --> 03:16:57.021]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:57.021 --> 03:17:00.602]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.602 --> 03:17:02.743]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:17:54.318 --> 03:17:58.283]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.283 --> 03:18:01.567]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.567 --> 03:18:07.836]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.836 --> 03:18:10.619]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:15.165]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.165 --> 03:18:21.634]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.634 --> 03:18:26.601]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.338 --> 03:18:31.260]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.260 --> 03:18:38.464]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.464 --> 03:18:43.166]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.166 --> 03:18:49.370]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.370 --> 03:18:53.352]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:59.321 --> 03:19:01.683]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:19:57.246 --> 03:20:08.196]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:13.861]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Roger Stone.
[03:20:13.861 --> 03:20:19.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.566 --> 03:20:20.767]  Welcome back.
[03:20:20.767 --> 03:20:24.550]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.285 --> 03:20:39.856]  If you go to the top of the Drudge Report now you can see that evidently President Donald Trump and yours truly Roger Stone are the two people who seem to be in the crosshairs of Robert Mueller.
[03:20:39.856 --> 03:20:47.041]  I myself have been subjected to a torrent of illegal leaks from the special counsel's office and a
[03:20:48.392 --> 03:20:52.255]  A tsunami of disinformation.
[03:20:52.255 --> 03:20:53.956]  Nothing has changed.
[03:20:53.956 --> 03:21:00.541]  But I still have to suffer the lies, the slurs, the smears of the far left.
[03:21:00.541 --> 03:21:04.204]  Let's take a look at MSNBC, for example.
[03:21:04.204 --> 03:21:08.187]  Another bombshell breaking in the Mueller probe is yes, there are tapes and Mueller has them.
[03:21:08.187 --> 03:21:10.669]  He's listening to Roger Stone's conference calls from 2016.
[03:21:10.669 --> 03:21:13.071]  In the background of this entire
[03:21:26.529 --> 03:21:34.314]  That same day, Stone sent former Trump advisor Sam Nunberg an email that stated, I quote, dined with my new pal Julian Assange last night.
[03:21:34.314 --> 03:21:43.158]  Stone later said that was just a joke, but it was 70 days after that that he tweeted to the world, quote, trust me, it will soon be Podesta's time in the barrel.
[03:21:43.158 --> 03:21:49.462]  If he was making all these claims in public and on these conference calls, was any of it going back to the people running the Trump campaign?
[03:21:49.662 --> 03:21:53.165]  And on them he would talk about his relationship and friendship with Paul Manafort.
[03:21:53.165 --> 03:21:55.586]  He'd talk about the inner workings of the Trump campaign.
[03:21:55.586 --> 03:22:01.370]  He also talked a lot about WikiLeaks plans to release emails and he used the quote, royal this race.
[03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:07.915]  And a witness in The Probe, Jason Sullivan, who helped him organize those conference calls said he claimed contact with Julian Assange.
[03:22:07.915 --> 03:22:13.179]  But it could also just be Mueller scrutinizing the number of times Roger Stone claimed contact with Assange.
[03:22:13.179 --> 03:22:15.721]  As you played, Roger now says he never had
[03:22:16.041 --> 03:22:16.401]  We're good.
[03:22:30.998 --> 03:22:43.183]  Well, I guess if you can get people testifying to private communications, particularly people who are in a position of trust with Roger Stone, then that way we have more weight than him just saying what he says on Alex Jones' show.
[03:22:43.183 --> 03:22:48.465]  I mean, Roger Stone's defense at this moment in time is that I am the world's biggest liar.
[03:22:48.465 --> 03:22:53.287]  I probably said again and again and again that I was in touch with Julian Assange.
[03:22:53.287 --> 03:22:54.087]  I knew what he was doing.
[03:22:54.087 --> 03:22:55.468]  But be honest, David.
[03:22:55.468 --> 03:22:57.629]  Do you find that a potentially credible defense?
[03:22:58.129 --> 03:23:07.116]  Yes, it is, yes, because he is known for lying and being a provocateur and saying whatever he thinks is necessary to say at that moment in time.
[03:23:07.116 --> 03:23:19.165]  He was also in touch with Guccifer 2.0, that Russian internet persona that we now know was a Russian intelligent... There you have it, a recitation of the recycled lies.
[03:23:20.025 --> 03:23:27.191]  Over a 10-day period, I said three times, including on the Alex Jones Show, that I had communicated with Assange.
[03:23:27.191 --> 03:23:35.738]  As I clarified at that time, and later under oath for the House Intelligence Committee, that communication was through a third party.
[03:23:35.738 --> 03:23:41.123]  I identified that third party for the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:23:41.823 --> 03:23:45.925]  My communication with Guccifer 2.0 is benign.
[03:23:45.925 --> 03:23:55.549]  The 24-word exchange on Twitter direct messages actually takes place after Wikileaks has already published the DNC material.
[03:23:55.549 --> 03:24:06.333]  Consequently, based on content, context, and timing, it is meaningless and most certainly not any evidence of collusion or coordination.
[03:24:07.273 --> 03:24:16.218]  This is the continued recycling of already discredited reports by my critics on the far left.
[03:24:16.218 --> 03:24:21.681]  The Wall Street Journal reporter who you saw, Shelby Holliday, is well aware of the facts.
[03:24:21.681 --> 03:24:29.586]  You can actually read our entire exchange at StoneColdTruth.com to see how she is engaged in fake news.
[03:24:30.166 --> 03:24:41.815]  In the meantime, the Washington Post reports that Steve Bannon went before the grand jury and told the Post that he was questioned about me.
[03:24:41.815 --> 03:24:44.437]  The point of this, of course, is that on October 2nd,
[03:24:45.402 --> 03:25:04.793]  When Julia Assange had a press event and did not release any material to the consternation of a lot of the press were watching, including Alex Jones, he did say in that presser that he would specifically have a release for the next six weeks every week.
[03:25:04.793 --> 03:25:06.174]  He laid out a schedule.
[03:25:06.955 --> 03:25:13.159]  I imparted that information to Bannon via email, but it's not inside information.
[03:25:13.159 --> 03:25:22.465]  It had been published on Politico hours before, but most in the media were reporting the fact that Assange had nothing and would do nothing.
[03:25:22.465 --> 03:25:24.507]  That's not actually what he said.
[03:25:25.347 --> 03:25:33.733]  In a subsequent exchange with Matt Boyle of Breitbart News, he asked me whether what Assange had was good, and I said it is.
[03:25:33.733 --> 03:25:47.362]  That's based on the constant assurances of my source, Randy Credico, that the material that WikiLeaks had was, quote, devastating, a bombshell, would change history, would destroy Hillary.
[03:25:47.922 --> 03:25:51.145]  Those are not specifics, those are generals.
[03:25:51.145 --> 03:25:53.126]  So what I did here is pretty clear.
[03:25:53.126 --> 03:26:05.836]  I used public sources, including the WikiLeaks Twitter feed, and setting a Google News alert for Julian Assange, reading every interview he gave, and he gave many.
[03:26:05.836 --> 03:26:11.621]  And based on that solid tip from Credico, I punked, I bluffed,
[03:26:12.199 --> 03:26:21.965]  I postured and I hyped the Democrats over the coming release of the material, which would indeed change the race.
[03:26:21.965 --> 03:26:28.969]  But I say it again, I had no advance notice of the source or the content of that material.
[03:26:28.969 --> 03:26:32.711]  I was operating on public information and that tip.
[03:26:32.711 --> 03:26:39.515]  This really grows tedious as these false accusations come out just before the election.
[03:26:40.255 --> 03:26:52.680]  One has to assume that the purpose is to reinflate the whole Russian collusion narrative, since Mr. Mueller has produced no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:27:02.203]  There is, to this day, no evidence or no witness who can honestly testify before the grand jury, saying that I had advance notice of the WikiLeaks material.
[03:27:03.004 --> 03:27:06.107]  Alex Jones was a contemporary in this.
[03:27:06.107 --> 03:27:14.697]  He remembers my discussing the fact that I was trying to learn more like every journalist or politico in America.
[03:27:14.697 --> 03:27:17.140]  This is indeed a witch hunt.
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:25.105]  Those of you who want to help me in this extraordinary battle can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:27:25.105 --> 03:27:29.449]  My legal costs are projected to be almost two million dollars.
[03:27:29.449 --> 03:27:45.260]  This past week I took a polygraph exam analyzed by two of the most prominent lie detector experts in the country who have concluded that I told the truth on all these questions regarding the disclosure of the WikiLeaks material.
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:56.344]  I've made this information available to the New York Times, to the Washington Post, to the CBS, to Vice, and many others.
[03:27:56.344 --> 03:27:59.965]  But you'll find it buried in an ABC story.
[03:27:59.965 --> 03:28:07.388]  I stand by that and the fact that my testimony before the House Committee was entirely truthful and accurate.
[03:28:08.048 --> 03:28:16.898]  In the meantime, if you want to help the fight for freedom, remember the terrific specials we have going on at the Infowars.com store.
[03:28:16.898 --> 03:28:28.210]  It is only your loyal support that keeps us afloat and moving forward as we are under relentless attack, both in terms of harassment lawsuits and when it comes to censorship.
[03:28:28.770 --> 03:28:31.573]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:28:31.573 --> 03:28:33.455]  We are the cutting edge.
[03:28:33.455 --> 03:28:37.178]  We are the revolution, and we need your support.
[03:28:37.178 --> 03:28:50.751]  The efforts to close down this very forum, to shut down this platform, is an effort to silence me, to silence Alex Jones, ahead of next Tuesday's crucial election.
[03:28:50.751 --> 03:28:51.792]  Don't let it happen.
[03:28:53.496 --> 03:28:54.696]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:28:54.696 --> 03:28:58.618]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.618 --> 03:29:00.159]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:29:00.159 --> 03:29:03.120]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:03.120 --> 03:29:08.682]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.682 --> 03:29:09.882]  I can help you, too.
[03:29:09.882 --> 03:29:12.803]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:29:12.803 --> 03:29:15.044]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:29:15.044 --> 03:29:19.486]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:29:19.486 --> 03:29:21.767]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:29:23.147 --> 03:29:27.008]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:29:27.008 --> 03:29:31.989]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:29:31.989 --> 03:29:36.810]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[03:29:43.851 --> 03:29:46.152]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:29:54.206 --> 03:30:01.902]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:30:01.902 --> 03:30:02.363]  It's you!

[03:30:05.967 --> 03:30:07.268]  You are the info war.
[03:30:07.268 --> 03:30:10.272]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[03:31:13.965 --> 03:31:34.117]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:32:57.274 --> 03:32:59.896]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.899 --> 03:33:24.969]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.969 --> 03:33:28.454]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:28.454 --> 03:33:31.458]  Welcome back.
[03:33:32.453 --> 03:33:36.117]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.117 --> 03:33:53.955]  Joining me shortly will be our special guest, a close personal friend of the President, Tina Gertz, who was one of the key strategists in Donald Trump's stunning victory in Iowa and remains a senior advisor to the President's re-election campaign.
[03:33:54.816 --> 03:33:58.199]  I met Tana at the Republican National Convention.
[03:33:58.199 --> 03:34:16.316]  I really can't forget it because it was at that exact time that Alex Jones and I were invited on the set of the Young Turks only to be bushwhacked and claimed that we were somehow invading their site, that we were trying to break in where in fact we had been invited.
[03:34:16.796 --> 03:34:19.198]  It is a classic piece of television.
[03:34:19.198 --> 03:34:21.660]  You can find it on YouTube.
[03:34:21.660 --> 03:34:31.727]  And just the other day, Tucker Carlson sent me the YouTube link and says that he looked back at it and had to laugh because it was so funny.
[03:34:31.727 --> 03:34:43.676]  We are in the final days before the election, and I don't want to underestimate the role that Internet censorship is playing in the Democrats' campaign.
[03:34:44.426 --> 03:35:00.754]  What we've seen, without any objection from the mainstream media, is the wholesale censorship of libertarians, conservatives, Trump supporters, Republicans, and anyone who isn't a Democrat, seemingly.
[03:35:00.754 --> 03:35:10.358]  Yesterday, the Proud Boys were taken off of Facebook unilaterally, as were individuals who are members of that organization.
[03:35:10.858 --> 03:35:34.009]  We have seen pages with literally millions of followers on Facebook just overnight decapitated with an explanation that you have violated our standards, in some cases being accused of selling drugs over the internet or depicting acts of violence or sexual acts completely phony.
[03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:43.884]  This shows that they will push the envelope as far as they possibly can, and that the war on censorship is very, very real.
[03:35:44.594 --> 03:35:49.417]  No one has been more in the crossfire of this than InfoWars.
[03:35:49.417 --> 03:35:56.101]  That's why I want to remind you that on this Halloween, we need your support more than ever before.
[03:35:56.101 --> 03:36:03.805]  If you go to the InfoWars.com store right now, you will see the extraordinary specials that we have running.
[03:36:03.805 --> 03:36:06.867]  And that is really what funds us here at InfoWars.
[03:36:06.867 --> 03:36:12.930]  You see, we don't have any multinational corporate sponsors.
[03:36:12.930 --> 03:36:13.651]  We don't have
[03:36:14.751 --> 03:36:20.493]  Any one source of funding, we depend completely and totally on you.
[03:36:20.493 --> 03:36:23.435]  So let's look at some of these terrific products.
[03:36:23.435 --> 03:36:27.556]  My all-time favorite, of course, is Brain Force Plus.
[03:36:27.556 --> 03:36:36.119]  This is a natural product, now reduced at $19.98, which gives you mental clarity and mental energy.
[03:36:36.119 --> 03:36:40.621]  At that four o'clock time of the day, when you begin to have a dip,
[03:36:41.241 --> 03:36:53.333]  I find this to be a great product, yet you don't get that wired feeling that you get from the energy drinks that are laced with ephedrine and other stimulants.
[03:36:53.333 --> 03:36:59.800]  This is a smooth, sustained mental energy and clarity that I think you will enjoy.
[03:36:59.800 --> 03:37:00.400]  6,017 other
[03:37:03.803 --> 03:37:05.944]  Infowarriors agree with me.
[03:37:05.944 --> 03:37:09.805]  This is one of the very best specials you can find.
[03:37:09.805 --> 03:37:13.066]  I also am very fond of Silver Bullet.
[03:37:13.066 --> 03:37:19.668]  Silver Bullet is a colloidal silver product which boosts immunity.
[03:37:19.668 --> 03:37:28.230]  It has for centuries been known as an antibacterial and an antiviral, but the special electronic
[03:37:28.860 --> 03:37:39.249]  Process used by InfoWars makes this a far more absorbable formula than other silver components that are on the market.
[03:37:39.249 --> 03:37:42.352]  This is one of the very best products.
[03:37:42.352 --> 03:37:50.279]  So again, I urge you to go to the InfoWars.com store and load up for your Christmas shopping.
[03:37:50.279 --> 03:37:55.884]  It's the only thing that allows us to stay afloat here and moving forward.
[03:37:56.344 --> 03:38:02.108]  And while you're at it, grab a copy of my latest book, Stone's Rules.
[03:38:02.108 --> 03:38:05.410]  This is a manifesto for victory.
[03:38:05.410 --> 03:38:13.456]  This is an indispensable track for anyone who is in politics or business or media or fashion.
[03:38:13.456 --> 03:38:19.020]  Stone's Rules, available at a terrific price at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:35.648]  If you buy your copy of Stone's Rules at the InfoWars store and mail it to me, a special offer for InfoWarriors only, it will be my privilege to sign it and send it back to you at my own expense.
[03:38:35.648 --> 03:38:42.431]  So you can go to the InfoWars.com store now, get your copy and mail it to me at this address.
[03:38:43.223 --> 03:38:44.624]  Roger Stone, P.O.
[03:38:44.624 --> 03:38:46.604]  Box 813450, 4429 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, Florida 330813450.
[03:38:46.604 --> 03:38:48.945]  We'll leave that up a second for you.
[03:38:48.945 --> 03:38:52.827]  You can get your copy of Stone's Rules, include in it your receipt
[03:39:05.031 --> 03:39:11.475]  That shows that you got it on the Infowars.com store, and I will gladly send it back to you.
[03:39:11.475 --> 03:39:15.197]  This is the fifth book that I have written.
[03:39:15.197 --> 03:39:24.641]  My other books, the Clinton's War on Women, for example, the Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, also available at the Infowars.com store.
[03:39:24.641 --> 03:39:29.344]  So if you buy those and you want those autographed as well, send them along.
[03:39:29.344 --> 03:39:33.446]  Again, this is an offer for Infowarriors only.
[03:39:34.736 --> 03:39:35.678]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:39:35.678 --> 03:39:38.645]  You're on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:39:39.483 --> 03:39:46.828]  It seems like Nancy Pelosi may be measuring the drapes in the White House a little too early.
[03:39:46.828 --> 03:39:53.392]  She tells Fox News that she is confident that the Democrats will take the House.
[03:39:53.392 --> 03:39:56.154]  I say it's too early to know.
[03:39:56.154 --> 03:40:03.378]  This will come down to a very small number of districts and a very small number of votes.
[03:40:03.378 --> 03:40:05.900]  And that's why every single vote counts.
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:14.464]  Those who are relying on polling should keep in mind that any poll is merely a snapshot in time.
[03:40:14.464 --> 03:40:18.386]  It is only good for the episecond in which it is taken.
[03:40:18.386 --> 03:40:31.572]  And that polls can differ in their results based on the order of the questions, the wording of the questions, the size of the sample, the proper drawing of the sample, and so on.
[03:40:32.402 --> 03:40:49.828]  One thing that all of the polls show is that this election is very close and that the president has re-energized his political base, making this a far closer contest than it looked a few months ago when Democrats were claiming there would be a blue wave.
[03:40:50.688 --> 03:40:54.250]  I think the Senate is now safely in Republican hands.
[03:40:54.250 --> 03:40:58.152]  That would be my prediction, but the House is up for grabs.
[03:40:58.152 --> 03:41:01.693]  Let's make no mistake about the Democrats' plan.
[03:41:01.693 --> 03:41:08.136]  If the Democrats win the House, they will enact articles of impeachment against our President almost immediately.
[03:41:08.856 --> 03:41:14.078]  I doubt they'll be based on any evidence of Russian collusion because there is none.
[03:41:14.078 --> 03:41:29.242]  But we've already seen the dress rehearsal, the dry run for what they have in mind, and the 19 women who falsely accused President Trump of sexual assault in the 2016 campaign will be recycled in a show trial in the Senate.
[03:41:29.722 --> 03:41:42.848]  Meanwhile, the New York Times will pound away on the issue of Donald Trump's taxes, where he appears to have perfectly legally avoided paying millions of dollars in taxes based on the current tax law.
[03:41:42.848 --> 03:41:46.150]  That doesn't show he's crooked, it shows that he's smart.
[03:41:46.770 --> 03:41:53.634]  But there will be yet another attempt to whip up a public hysteria about our president.
[03:41:53.634 --> 03:41:59.116]  This is what happens if we lose the House a few short days from now.
[03:41:59.116 --> 03:42:01.858]  Which is why, as Alex Jones put it a little earlier,
[03:42:02.498 --> 03:42:06.441]  It's vitally important that you get every true believer you know out.
[03:42:06.441 --> 03:42:13.525]  And then figure out who among your friends and associates, your co-workers, is friendly or is a persuadable.
[03:42:13.525 --> 03:42:17.888]  And get those marginal extra votes to the polls.
[03:42:17.888 --> 03:42:19.869]  Every vote will count.
[03:42:19.869 --> 03:42:22.631]  I'm planning to head to Austin for election night.
[03:42:22.631 --> 03:42:24.932]  I think it's going to be a nail-biter.
[03:42:24.932 --> 03:42:29.535]  Anyone who tells you that they're certain about what will happen is blowing smoke.
[03:42:30.095 --> 03:42:31.216]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:31.216 --> 03:42:33.257]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:33.257 --> 03:42:36.459]  I'll be back with Tana Gertz on the other side.

[03:47:08.237 --> 03:47:12.449]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:12.449 --> 03:47:15.959]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:19.657 --> 03:47:20.718]  Welcome back.
[03:47:20.718 --> 03:47:26.765]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show right here at InfoWars.
[03:47:26.765 --> 03:47:32.130]  And now it is my distinct pleasure to bring on our guest, Tana Gertz.
[03:47:32.130 --> 03:47:39.098]  Tana Gertz is a personal friend of the president and the first family for two decades.
[03:47:39.098 --> 03:47:42.121]  Here's what President Trump himself said about Tana.
[03:47:42.816 --> 03:47:44.797]  Tana is truly a star.
[03:47:44.797 --> 03:47:52.960]  She has that rare combination of laid-back charm and razor-sharp execution, and she doesn't put up with nonsense.
[03:47:52.960 --> 03:47:55.361]  Tana, you sound a little bit like me.
[03:47:55.361 --> 03:47:58.722]  I'm delighted to have you here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:58.722 --> 03:47:59.843]  Welcome.
[03:47:59.843 --> 03:48:01.343]  Thank you, Roger, for having me.
[03:48:01.343 --> 03:48:02.664]  I'm excited to be here with you.
[03:48:03.792 --> 03:48:10.438]  Now, you first kind of became a television star in 2005 when you starred on The Apprentice.
[03:48:10.438 --> 03:48:15.122]  As I recall, you're the only person in the history of the show to never be fired.
[03:48:15.122 --> 03:48:25.471]  But then you had a whole second career when you emerged as a key strategist for Donald Trump's campaign in Iowa and then a senior advisor to his campaign.
[03:48:26.301 --> 03:48:41.915]  I remember meeting you at the Republican National Convention when Alex Jones and I were actually invited on the set of the Young Turks, which turned out to be an ambush in a shouting match that you can still see on YouTube.
[03:48:41.915 --> 03:48:45.518]  I know that you're, like me, like Alex Jones, a fighter.
[03:48:45.518 --> 03:48:47.320]  Do you remember that terrific occasion?
[03:48:48.178 --> 03:48:52.723]  I remember meeting you and I remember meeting Alex and I remember the fight.
[03:48:52.723 --> 03:48:59.769]  I was right there right beside you doing radio as well with an LA station and the fight broke out and I was like, who are these people?
[03:48:59.769 --> 03:49:01.331]  Like, what are the Young Turks?
[03:49:01.331 --> 03:49:12.362]  I didn't even know who they were and couldn't understand why they were picking a fight with you guys and you and Alex were fighters just like myself and you were holding your ground and there was chaos and
[03:49:12.802 --> 03:49:16.584]  And then you and I talked afterwards, and it was just, it was amazing.
[03:49:16.584 --> 03:49:19.786]  I mean, at the end of the day, we were making history, Roger.
[03:49:19.786 --> 03:49:21.807]  It was indeed a piece of history.
[03:49:21.807 --> 03:49:30.112]  Actually, Tucker Carlson sent me this link, which is up on YouTube just a few days ago, marveling at how entertaining it is.
[03:49:31.318 --> 03:49:44.225]  I thought, going back to 1988, that Donald Trump had the stature, the independence, the size, I don't mean physical size, although he's very tall and broad-shouldered, to be a great president.
[03:49:44.225 --> 03:49:51.208]  And a lot of my friends in the political community made fun of me for that, saying, oh, Donald Trump, he'll never really run.
[03:49:51.208 --> 03:49:53.209]  He's just trying to burnish his brand.
[03:49:53.209 --> 03:49:54.310]  He could never win.
[03:49:54.890 --> 03:50:00.296]  And here we have, two years into the Trump presidency, amazing success.
[03:50:00.296 --> 03:50:05.742]  What first convinced you that Donald Trump could be a great candidate and a great president?
[03:50:06.838 --> 03:50:08.220]  Well, that's a great question.
[03:50:08.220 --> 03:50:14.466]  I met him for the very first time in 2005, as you mentioned, when I was a contestant on his show.
[03:50:14.466 --> 03:50:21.774]  And I never wanted to go on the show for any other reason other than to learn from America's business icon, Donald Trump.
[03:50:21.774 --> 03:50:23.856]  And I went there and I had an amazing time.
[03:50:23.856 --> 03:50:29.422]  But as the weeks were clicking off and people were getting fired left and right, and I got
[03:50:29.582 --> 03:50:30.143]  We're good to go.
[03:50:51.583 --> 03:51:20.372]  You know, I'm not a billionaire yet, but he is, and I just wanted to absorb it all, and I acted as if I was a student of his, and I had an 18-week business course learning from him, and so I saw attitude and persistence and tenacity and all these characters that I thought, wow, he could make a great president, and he would make a great president, but I never thought he'd ever give up his plush life and, you know, his penthouse and
[03:51:21.392 --> 03:51:28.579]  The career that he had to go and deal with the swamp creatures that he's had to deal with, so I never thought he would do it.
[03:51:28.579 --> 03:51:34.004]  Because you'd have to be crazy to want to make America great again, because look at what's happening to him.
[03:51:34.004 --> 03:51:38.829]  So I knew he'd be great, but I didn't think he'd do it because I thought he had such a great life.
[03:51:38.829 --> 03:51:42.832]  Why surround yourself with this toxic environment that he's been put under?
[03:51:42.832 --> 03:51:44.334]  And I'm so happy he did, though.
[03:51:45.549 --> 03:51:49.271]  Well, I think people underestimate his toughness.
[03:51:49.271 --> 03:51:56.636]  I think back to an interview he gave with Oprah Winfrey almost 30 years ago, in which she said, What about politics, Donald?
[03:51:56.636 --> 03:51:58.518]  Do you think you'd ever run for public office?
[03:51:58.518 --> 03:52:01.039]  Do you think you'd ever run for president?
[03:52:01.039 --> 03:52:03.481]  No, he said, I don't think so.
[03:52:03.481 --> 03:52:06.483]  Unless things get so bad that I have no choice.
[03:52:07.156 --> 03:52:08.477]  And that's where we are today.
[03:52:08.477 --> 03:52:12.099]  Donald Trump didn't run because he needed to be somebody.
[03:52:12.099 --> 03:52:15.460]  He didn't need to run because he needed to prove something.
[03:52:15.460 --> 03:52:19.202]  He loves his country and he saw us going down the drain.
[03:52:19.202 --> 03:52:24.125]  And therefore he's serving as president at great cost to himself.
[03:52:24.125 --> 03:52:32.789]  Not only financial cost, but the vituperation and the personal attacks on him and his family are enough to turn your stomach.
[03:52:33.289 --> 03:52:44.087]  He is literally the toughest man I have ever met in American politics and that covers Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole and many others.
[03:52:44.087 --> 03:52:44.368]  Go ahead.
[03:52:45.111 --> 03:52:48.734]  Well, I was going to say, you said exactly what I said to him, Roger.
[03:52:48.734 --> 03:52:52.256]  I was just with him a couple weeks ago and backstage with him.
[03:52:52.256 --> 03:53:00.682]  You know, I could say anything to him and I just looked at him and I said, President Trump, I said, you are the toughest, strongest man that I know.
[03:53:00.682 --> 03:53:03.384]  Those are the exact words that came out of my mouth.
[03:53:03.384 --> 03:53:04.765]  And he was like, oh, thanks, Tana.
[03:53:04.765 --> 03:53:07.307]  You know, he brushes it off like it's no big deal.
[03:53:07.307 --> 03:53:09.489]  But I'm like, no, I mean this.
[03:53:09.489 --> 03:53:10.690]  You are so tough.
[03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:22.529]  I mean, you and I are tough, Roger, but honestly, day in and day out, attacking of the family, your wife, your children, your looks, your weight, your mental capacity, I mean, you name it!
[03:53:22.529 --> 03:53:25.534]  It's like at some point I said to myself, I'm tough.
[03:53:26.152 --> 03:53:30.857]  But when I give in, like when I cave after two years of this and just say, you know what, screw it.
[03:53:30.857 --> 03:53:32.178]  I'm going to go back to my life.
[03:53:32.178 --> 03:53:34.301]  I want to, you know, eat Top Ramen.
[03:53:34.301 --> 03:53:38.265]  I mean, I'm going to eat filet mignon and not be like eating Big Macs on the plane.
[03:53:38.265 --> 03:53:40.066]  I want to have my life back.
[03:53:40.066 --> 03:53:43.230]  But he does it and he does it for you and me and America.
[03:53:44.218 --> 03:53:47.620]  Well, the results I think are clear.
[03:53:47.620 --> 03:53:49.802]  4.2 million new jobs created.
[03:53:49.802 --> 03:53:53.824]  Unemployment at the lowest rate since 1969.
[03:53:53.824 --> 03:54:01.950]  Hispanic and black unemployment at the lowest rate since those statistics began being kept.
[03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:05.272]  The greatest wage growth in our history.
[03:54:05.272 --> 03:54:09.715]  Billions of dollars coming back in the country for reinvestment.
[03:54:09.715 --> 03:54:14.018]  Rebuilding our military strength as a deterrent.
[03:54:14.518 --> 03:54:17.581]  What's your thoughts on next Tuesday's midterm elections?
[03:54:39.432 --> 03:54:42.553]  Well, I agree with you and what you said about everything that he's done.
[03:54:42.553 --> 03:54:46.653]  It's like, show me another president that has that track record.
[03:54:46.653 --> 03:54:49.034]  Show me who has done all these amazing things.
[03:54:49.034 --> 03:54:57.096]  I mean, I'm a woman, I'm a small business owner, woman-owned business, and I couldn't be more excited to be a woman entrepreneur in today's age.
[03:54:57.096 --> 03:55:04.217]  So, I think it's amazing that he's going to these rallies and he's tooting his own horn because we know the fake news isn't going to report it.
[03:55:04.217 --> 03:55:07.478]  So, I'm very excited about Tuesday.
[03:55:07.478 --> 03:55:08.878]  I've got my fingers crossed.
[03:55:09.378 --> 03:55:17.766]  That the Republicans get out there and vote and don't just rest on our laurels that we've got a great president, you know, as commander-in-chief doing the job.
[03:55:17.766 --> 03:55:21.190]  Because at the end of the day, he said to me, how are we looking in Iowa?
[03:55:21.190 --> 03:55:24.052]  And I said, I'm scared to be quite honest with you.
[03:55:24.052 --> 03:55:25.133]  He goes, well, how did they win?
[03:55:26.154 --> 03:55:29.216]  Two years ago I said, you, that's how they won.
[03:55:29.216 --> 03:55:32.738]  You were on the ticket and people went out and voted because of you.
[03:55:32.738 --> 03:55:39.222]  Now these people, these politicians, have to be worth something and a lot of them frankly aren't worth their weight.
[03:55:39.222 --> 03:55:41.404]  And I'm a little nervous.
[03:55:41.404 --> 03:55:43.625]  I pray that people get out.
[03:55:43.625 --> 03:55:54.072]  I'm telling people you've got to get out and vote if you like your 401k, if you like having money in the bank, if you like where we're at with taxes, and if you like having America be respected again.
[03:55:54.472 --> 03:56:03.278]  For goodness sakes, don't let the Democrats get their power and take it away from us because we are in for a treat for what's going to happen in 2020.
[03:56:03.278 --> 03:56:03.839]  So they gotta vote.
[03:56:06.770 --> 03:56:12.133]  All right, so now you know why Donald Trump referred to Tana Gertz as the Golden One.
[03:56:12.133 --> 03:56:15.675]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:15.675 --> 03:56:18.357]  You said it, and you said it best.
[03:56:18.357 --> 03:56:19.757]  Every vote will count.
[03:56:19.757 --> 03:56:31.424]  And although Donald Trump is not on the ballot, you know the mainstream media and the fake news media will interpret this election as a referendum on his leadership.
[03:56:32.004 --> 03:56:36.788]  It's the economy, stupid, as James Carville once famously said.
[03:56:36.788 --> 03:56:40.832]  Tana Gertz, thank you for joining us here at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:40.832 --> 03:56:42.853]  Thank you so much for having me, Roger.
[03:56:42.853 --> 03:56:43.554]  Have a great day.
[03:56:45.333 --> 03:56:59.585]  All right, there you have the woman Donald Trump referred to as the golden one, longtime friend of the president and the first family, and one of the architects of his extraordinary upset victory in Iowa.
[03:56:59.585 --> 03:57:00.546]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:57:00.546 --> 03:57:03.128]  You've been on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:03.128 --> 03:57:05.710]  It's Halloween, so I'm going to remind you one more time.
[03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:10.955]  Go to the Infowars.com store now and help gird us for the fight for freedom.
[03:57:11.335 --> 03:57:16.319]  We are under attack and we need your support as never before.
[03:57:16.319 --> 03:57:17.000]  Thank you.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:18.081]  God bless you.
[03:57:18.081 --> 03:57:22.684]  And disregard the fake news when it comes to Roger Stone.
[03:57:22.684 --> 03:57:25.266]  Many thanks.
[03:57:25.266 --> 03:57:31.111]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:57:31.111 --> 03:57:32.532]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:57:44.841 --> 03:57:50.485]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.485 --> 03:57:53.627]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.627 --> 03:57:56.289]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.289 --> 03:58:00.592]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.592 --> 03:58:08.077]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:08.077 --> 03:58:10.499]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:13.937 --> 03:58:16.158]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.158 --> 03:58:19.180]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.180 --> 03:58:31.108]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:31.108 --> 03:58:33.449]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:33.449 --> 03:58:35.811]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:58:35.811 --> 03:58:37.652]  I mean, what?
[03:58:37.652 --> 03:58:38.312]  I mean, never!
[03:58:44.488 --> 03:58:48.749]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:58:48.749 --> 03:58:52.230]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:52.230 --> 03:58:53.970]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:58:53.970 --> 03:58:57.251]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:58:57.251 --> 03:59:04.033]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:59:04.033 --> 03:59:09.114]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:59:09.454 --> 03:59:15.578]  But the goblins now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.578 --> 03:59:18.540]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.540 --> 03:59:19.641]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.641 --> 03:59:23.484]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.484 --> 03:59:25.485]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.485 --> 03:59:26.786]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.786 --> 03:59:27.867]  I've prayed for that.
[03:59:27.867 --> 03:59:29.508]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.508 --> 03:59:31.930]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.430 --> 03:59:33.550]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:36.071]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:36.071 --> 03:59:37.031]  I physically will.
[03:59:37.031 --> 03:59:46.734]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWars4.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[03:59:46.734 --> 03:59:49.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
