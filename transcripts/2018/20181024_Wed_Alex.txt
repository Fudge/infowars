[00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:12.703]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:14.484]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.185]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.426]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:19.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:25.050]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.632]  I'm here with Roger Stone in Austin, Texas, and we have got an emergency update for everybody.
[00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:46.473]  I've been saying this for about a month because I saw the pre-programming they're doing.
[00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:49.334]  Kind of like when they're rolling out a new Corvette or something.
[00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.435]  You see the promotionals or a new soft drink.
[00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:55.716]  You see the promotionals or a new taco at Taco Bell.
[00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:57.157]  You know when it's about to come out.
[00:00:57.737 --> 00:01:05.103]  They keep saying on CNN, MSNBC, Trump's going to cause violent attacks on the media when all he does is respond back to them and call them liars.
[00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:08.345]  And they're running around saying, shut down the alternative media, people like me.
[00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:22.857]  And so I've been pointing out that I believe, and Paul Watson has said this, and Mike Adams has said this, and Roger Stone has said this, that they're either going to provocateur some crazy or they're planting a false flag on themselves or on big tech like Apple or Google or Twitter or something.
[00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:35.272]  Well now I'm sure of it because I shot a live video last night and they took us off Twitter for it where I said I don't want any violence, nobody should be violent, I think they're planting a false flag against big tech or against something like CNN.
[00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:42.001]  They pulled the video and then had Lester Holt, New York Times, thousands of publications today say that I
[00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:43.818]  We're good to go.
[00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:03.097]  I've got chills.
[00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:04.858]  Jones wants them to assault us with rifles.
[00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:10.460]  Folks, they wouldn't be doing that as a script everywhere, like an invasion of a third world country.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.122]  I mean, this is like war level propaganda.
[00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:15.342]  You supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war.
[00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:20.164]  As William Randolph Hearst said, if Hearst published it, it would get us into the Spanish-American War.
[00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:23.126]  I know a PR rollout when I'm seeing it.
[00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:31.189]  And now CNN came out this morning and said Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist planning terror attacks with no links or no proof.
[00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:50.603]  So, I'm sure now that this is one of their big October surprises in the next month or two, to stage something or provocateur something and blame it on me, and Roger Stone concurs, we do not want any violence, we decry it, we stand against it, we're winning politically, it's the left calling for violence and shootings, police and beating up Rand Paul and everything else.
[00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:54.826]  But the fact that they're saying I'm calling for this when I never said it is chilling.
[00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:57.007]  So this is an emergency alert to get out ahead of this.
[00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:57.327]  Roger?
[00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.209]  Let's be as clear as we possibly can.
[00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:03.772]  Alex Jones and Infowars do not advocate violence against the media or anyone else.
[00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:12.437]  If there is an attack on any media outlet or any reporter, it is not countenanced by us, it is not advocated by us, it is not done by us.
[00:03:12.877 --> 00:03:16.280]  It is a false flag with the goal of blaming Alex Jones.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.322]  How do we get out ahead of this though?
[00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:19.544]  Because this is pure scripting.
[00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:21.086]  We're about to literally invade a country.
[00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:22.047]  I think we just did.
[00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:24.855]  All right, folks, we're going to be covering all of this.
[00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.297]  Are there two people worse than you guys in America right now?
[00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:28.818]  No, you.
[00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:29.898]  Yes, you.
[00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:32.300]  I think CNN and the New York Times were voting the Iraq War.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.960]  Yeah, you.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.661]  But that's all he wanted.
[00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:34.381]  He didn't want a response.
[00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:37.203]  Classic old fascist, fake leftist coward.
[00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:37.763]  Keep moving.
[00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:42.126]  You notice that these cowards, all they can do is misrepresent and then they didn't want the answer.
[00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:47.930]  He wanted to get the little token for his friends and his miserable life and then lie about us.
[00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.091]  That's what they do.
[00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:58.178]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide with only 13 days out to the 2018 historic elections.
[00:03:58.698 --> 00:04:08.161]  Bombs sent to Clinton, Obama, CNN evacuated, George Soros and more right on time so they can play the victim.
[00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.583]  We saw the PR rollout that I was saying used battle rifles and bombs and things on the media.
[00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:14.783]  None of it was true.
[00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:16.163]  Why would they push that?
[00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:17.164]  Because they were preparing
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.081]  The ground, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:27.043]  And they've got their giant migrant caravans, now over 50,000 people, being shipped in on U.N.
[00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:30.984]  and U.S.-funded vehicles from USAID.
[00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:36.586]  And it's in mainstream news, what I told you last week, that George Soros doesn't pay for it.
[00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:37.687]  The U.S.
[00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:39.087]  taxpayer through the U.N.
[00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:39.727]  pays for it.
[00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:40.488]  And then his
[00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:43.950]  Foundations run the operations.
[00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.131]  That's mainstream news.
[00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:47.152]  Documents all coming up.
[00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:53.317]  And they're being trucked up just like we predicted to slam into the border two days before the election.
[00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:57.560]  There'll be more than 200,000 people when they hit.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.121]  Stay with us.

[00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:54.968]  Yep!
[00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:57.410]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.621]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:31.727]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:45.282]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:45.442 --> 00:06:52.425]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're 13 days out from the midterm elections, and all hell is breaking loose, obviously.
[00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:58.327]  Coming up, I'm going to wait to the second hour, but we've got it all ready and prepared for you.
[00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:10.891]  Dozens and dozens of clips, and I'm going to show you the news articles for yourself here in a moment, where in the last few months, you can go see it for yourself, I laid out exactly and precisely
[00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:38.812]  How they are preparing the public for the idea that Trump and the conservative pro-American media aren't just Nazis, but that they are terrorists who are going to attack the media and attack universities and attack the Democratic Party to say that our political actions are illegitimate and that we are going to cause all of this violence, so we need to be shut down.
[00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:47.472]  So that is all coming up when Mike Adams joins us in the second hour today.
[00:07:48.532 --> 00:07:59.836]  And it ties into what's happening with the stock market, it ties into what's happening with the illegal alien invader UN-funded, US government-funded operation under USAID.
[00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:01.137]  That's all confirmed.
[00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:02.637]  We're gonna be breaking it all down.
[00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:09.120]  And as I said, the answer is to respond with cutting the UN funding.
[00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:29.232]  Now obviously, the big story at Infowars.com and Newswars.com is that a pipe bomb got mailed yesterday, a very small little pipe bomb, to one of George Soros' palatial mansions in New York, in the Hamptons.
[00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:39.256]  Then, another similar pipe bomb reportedly got mailed to CNN, one to Obama, and one, of course, to the Clintons.
[00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:42.045]  All there in New York.
[00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:52.960]  Now, remember if you go back, about a month ago, a gentleman was busted in New York cooking up a, he's put guilty, a 200 pound bomb.
[00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:59.665]  In his basement to bomb the Republicans to cancel the election.
[00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:12.287]  He was going to detonate it inside the Washington Monument Mall on the morning of Election Day to try to cancel the election because the Republicans are going to try to steal the election or cancel it.
[00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:13.687]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:14.727]  He's a crazy leftist.
[00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:15.648]  He's pled guilty.
[00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:17.388]  He's confessed.
[00:09:18.428 --> 00:09:23.309]  Now, here are some of the articles dealing with this.
[00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:29.369]  Feds investigating potential explosive devices sent to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.472]  CNN's New York headquarters evacuated a suspicious package.
[00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:33.553]  They're saying it's a bomb.
[00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:38.056]  Suspicious packages addressed to the White House intercepted.
[00:09:38.096 --> 00:09:39.738]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:43.821]  Secret Service intercepts suspicious packages sent to Obama, Hillary, Clinton.
[00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:52.208]  Now, let's go back now to just a few
[00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.351]  Weeks ago and a few months ago.
[00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.492]  Here's two weeks ago.
[00:09:56.512 --> 00:10:00.634]  Brett Kavanaugh and the information terrorists trying to reshape America.
[00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:04.716]  First person they attack is yours truly saying, I am a terrorist.
[00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:10.398]  That's Wired Magazine in a huge 30-page article of pure bull.
[00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:13.840]  Now, let's just keep moving back from there.
[00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.202]  Here is Media Matters immoralizing
[00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.472]  Memorializing what happened.
[00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:30.879]  Alex Jones says Infowars platform bans are first step in globalist plot to carry out violent false flag attacks against CNN and MSNBC.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.205]  Yeah, they keep saying Alex Jones wants people to attack CNN and MSNBC with battle rifles.
[00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:39.426]  They never show a clip.
[00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:40.787]  They never show a quote.
[00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:42.188]  They just lie.
[00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.350]  Now it's not rocket science.
[00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:54.489]  That when they start saying Jones wants violence against the Clintons, and Jones wants violence against Soros, and he's gonna get Soros hurt saying he was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.211]  He said that on 60 Minutes, and in PR, and in a book.
[00:10:58.531 --> 00:10:59.591]  I played the clip many times.
[00:11:01.172 --> 00:11:11.476]  That clearly, they're saying Trump's gonna cause violence in the media, when they're the ones calling for violence against him, a hundred to one, the left calls for violence and carries out violence versus the right.
[00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:12.316]  That's well known.
[00:11:13.597 --> 00:11:13.997]  In the media.
[00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:21.458]  So, Alex Jones says platform bans are first step in globalist plot to carry out violent false flags.
[00:11:21.638 --> 00:11:24.859]  That's August 6th, when we had red alerts about that.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.660]  Now it's beginning.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:34.123]  August 4th, protest, false flag warning, a perfect storm for staged deaths to demonize conservatives.
[00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:44.366]  Censorship purge points to imminent false flag violence before midterm elections bigger than 9-11 to be blamed on Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:11:44.606 --> 00:11:45.907]  That's a Mike Adams article.
[00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:48.690]  Emergency!
[00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:53.875]  Deep state Democrats preparing false flag attacks against media, big tech to steal election.
[00:11:53.995 --> 00:11:57.939]  The next stage of media censorship again is about to be launched August 16.
[00:12:00.123 --> 00:12:00.964]  Emergency alert!
[00:12:01.084 --> 00:12:02.625]  Media false flag imminent!
[00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:08.010]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone issue an emergency warning about the latest media attacks and decry violence.
[00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.032]  Media false flag imminent.
[00:12:10.132 --> 00:12:11.853]  Millie Weaver, August 17th.
[00:12:12.293 --> 00:12:16.057]  Alex Jones warns the deep state will bomb federal buildings and blame InfoWars.
[00:12:16.077 --> 00:12:17.638]  We've got that video coming up.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.461]  Media false flag imminent.
[00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:22.082]  Another article.
[00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:23.763]  Emergency report!
[00:12:23.823 --> 00:12:26.205]  Trump must take action now to stop false flags.
[00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:32.703]  If not, he could fall victim to globalist trick that I predicted they would launch two weeks before the election.
[00:12:33.484 --> 00:12:39.088]  We have the clip where I call specifically two weeks before they would launch the bomb, false flags.
[00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:44.733]  So those are just some of the reports.
[00:12:46.314 --> 00:12:49.116]  CNN accuses Infowars of being complicit in domestic terrorism.
[00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:52.239]  Doesn't show where or why, just says we are helping terrorists.
[00:12:53.137 --> 00:13:20.349]  I mean, it's not hard that they're about to frame us for this, and to predict it, and then now you see the pipe bombs getting mailed, and then they find the mentally ill individual, or the person they've wound up, or the Patsy, which the Democrats and the Globalists are famous for, just like they blamed Oklahoma City bombing within 30 minutes on Rush Limbaugh and all of talk radio and all conservatives in America, just like if there's a mass shooting they blame all gun owners, you can see them preparing it all.
[00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:30.106]  And now the last piece, 13 days out, will be finding out that it's a right-wing extremist and blaming it on us.
[00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:39.350]  And saying, he visited InfoWars, he visited Drudge Report, he visited Tucker Carlson, he watched Fox News.
[00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:46.673]  You can see the scripting, and boy, we told you, Jones needed to be taken off the air, and now, why?
[00:13:47.753 --> 00:13:48.033]  Why?
[00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:51.535]  He mailed the bombs, or somebody he influenced mailed the bombs.
[00:13:52.389 --> 00:14:06.499]  And this is just to gauge and create anxiety that it's the right wing and that Hillary and Soros and Obama and CNN are good guys that are just trying to talk about the news and help America.
[00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:09.401]  And so we've been resisting them and saying they're globalists.
[00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:12.924]  And so we've been saying dirty words like nationalists and other evil stuff.
[00:14:13.324 --> 00:14:16.206]  And so now with the election 13 days away,
[00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:20.703]  You know they're planning bigger events now.
[00:14:20.983 --> 00:14:34.715]  Now that they've named themselves as the victims and have created the hype and the fear, now there can be the big event and then they can bust the group or individuals or the lone wolf that's behind it and properly blame all of us.
[00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:35.035]  Remember?
[00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:36.716]  Lester Holt is a liar.
[00:14:36.837 --> 00:14:38.698]  Alex Jones did not call for violence.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.963]  But those videos were all taken off Twitter, where I showed that I never called.
[00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.391]  For hurting the media, but they don't care.
[00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:50.677]  They all get up there and they all lie because it's a dangerous talking point.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.522]  It's a plan.
[00:14:54.563 --> 00:14:59.831]  And if you think the censorship purge has been bad so far, all of this was done in preparation.
[00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:15.114]  For when they really stage the big false flags, the new 9-11s, the new Oklahoma cities, and blame it on us, where we're unable to communicate on social media and other systems, like when they say in the news every day that I say nobody died at Parkland, or their Martian slave bases.
[00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:16.335]  I can't respond!
[00:15:17.056 --> 00:15:19.097]  So they can tell any lie they want.
[00:15:20.598 --> 00:15:21.118]  That's not enough.
[00:15:21.158 --> 00:15:22.579]  They're going to want to shut down talk radio.
[00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.523]  They've already staged attacks, tried to kill 17 members of Congress and failed.
[00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:29.812]  They've already tried to get Trump.
[00:15:30.112 --> 00:15:31.232]  They're making their move.
[00:15:31.272 --> 00:15:48.180]  That's why you need to open the emails we send you with news alerts and you need to share those with people at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and you need to send those off to others and say we're in the zone and we're the people's underground information network and without you the listeners and viewers taking action they could succeed.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.321]  But we're still here standing strong.
[00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:58.705]  In the fight, with core viewers and listeners bigger than ever at InfoWars.com, that's why it's critical you magnify and amplify everything we're doing.
[00:16:00.006 --> 00:16:06.289]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:07.430]  They know how the world really works.
[00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.771]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:12.012]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[00:16:12.632 --> 00:16:19.456]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:28.001]  But in full force, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:33.703]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[00:16:33.963 --> 00:16:37.804]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:47.486]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:50.087]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:52.767]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.528]  Now you've seen massive
[00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:57.210]  Corporate demonization and lies about us.
[00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:03.217]  You've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:08.703]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:13.848]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:28.855]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:33.637]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:17:34.757 --> 00:17:40.239]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.600]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:17:42.503 --> 00:17:43.664]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:48.148]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[00:17:48.729 --> 00:17:54.134]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:17:54.955 --> 00:18:02.462]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:05.485]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:16.645]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[00:18:17.085 --> 00:18:21.807]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:25.449]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:31.071]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[00:18:31.091 --> 00:18:34.333]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:36.854]  Get your X2.
[00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.537]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[00:18:39.897 --> 00:18:41.758]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.580]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:45.942]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:48.324]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[00:18:48.664 --> 00:18:52.127]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[00:18:52.347 --> 00:18:52.487]  And

[00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:19.890]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:28.340]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have, they want to shut down because we're successful when we expose them.

[00:19:50.694 --> 00:19:51.595]  You always come through.
[00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:52.696]  Take advantage of this.
[00:19:52.736 --> 00:19:54.879]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:06.923]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:47.862 --> 00:20:50.884]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with 13 Days Out from the election.
[00:20:50.964 --> 00:20:55.167]  It's the 24th day of October 2018 on this Wednesday edition.
[00:20:56.327 --> 00:20:58.129]  The second hour we're going to get into
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:18.375]  The clear hype that the right wing, that the Trump army, that Infowars is causing violence and wants violence to the point of corporate media in unison saying that Trump's calling for violence, never showing him call for violence, and that I'm calling for bombing and shooting the media.
[00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:26.902]  Now when you see them say that everywhere but not show a clip, that means the deep state that owns and runs them, that has conquered this country,
[00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:33.757]  That is on every channel telling you being a nationalist or being a Christian is bad.
[00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:42.244]  That if you believe in America and you believe as a taxpayer that you have certain benefits and you believe you have certain God-given rights that you are a Nazi.
[00:21:43.465 --> 00:21:46.387]  I watched last night and this morning every news channel.
[00:21:47.268 --> 00:21:55.815]  There's an article on Infowars.com where every major corporate fake news channel says that Trump is a Nazi.
[00:21:56.991 --> 00:21:58.873]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:21:59.173 --> 00:22:00.734]  Steve Watson, Trump is Hitler.
[00:22:01.555 --> 00:22:02.556]  Excuse me, it's worse than that.
[00:22:03.036 --> 00:22:10.163]  Unhinged Democrats and leftist media call POTUS a fascist dictator for saying America even exists.
[00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:11.304]  And that's really all he's saying.
[00:22:14.298 --> 00:22:22.625]  That's the upside-down world, and they're saying, we're going to cause violence, and then a pipe bomb shows up at George Soros, the kingpin, to make him the poor baby.
[00:22:23.025 --> 00:22:29.330]  And the headline is, in all these papers last night and today, the same headline, Holocaust survivor.
[00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:35.295]  He survived the Nazis, the poor thing, and now he's facing pipe bombs.
[00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:39.819]  He worked for the Nazis and said it was the best time of his life.
[00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:42.464]  Happy making time.
[00:22:43.004 --> 00:22:47.127]  By the way, that's one reason they took us off YouTube, is we played those videos, the Young Turks, so they didn't exist.
[00:22:47.507 --> 00:22:55.392]  Later, I'm gonna play the full compilation of him on NPR, him on 60 Minutes, saying the best time of his life was working for the Nazis, rounding Jews up.
[00:22:55.952 --> 00:22:58.254]  And it's in Dinesh D'Souza's movie, but I digress.
[00:22:58.274 --> 00:23:00.355]  His latest movie.
[00:23:02.176 --> 00:23:02.797]  Think about that!
[00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:08.801]  Show, right on time, George Soros, and then,
[00:23:10.353 --> 00:23:38.239]  Hillary, and Bill, and then Obama, and then CNN, and oh, I bet some more little pipe bombs get mailed, and then they find the mental patient, or they find the Patsy, or they find the group, and oh, they were Infowars believers in the conspiracy theory that George Soros is involved with the UN, and involved in world government, and that he's a bad person, and that
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.081]  He's an enemy of this country.
[00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:42.321]  I mean, he is a globalist.
[00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:43.902]  He is a Nazi collaborator.
[00:23:44.102 --> 00:23:45.303]  He's totally out of control.
[00:23:45.523 --> 00:23:46.683]  It's in all the federal filings.
[00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:48.164]  He is one of the biggest funders.
[00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:48.965]  He gets U.S.
[00:23:49.005 --> 00:23:51.786]  taxpayer money to do it through the U.N.
[00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:54.628]  And then he's quarterbacking all this stuff.
[00:23:54.908 --> 00:23:59.190]  So he gets a pipe bomb, and then it's like Oprah Winfrey.
[00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.790]  You get a car.
[00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.390]  You get a car.
[00:24:00.731 --> 00:24:01.591]  You get a pipe bomb.
[00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:02.371]  You get a pipe bomb.
[00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:03.012]  You get a pipe bomb.
[00:24:03.412 --> 00:24:04.833]  Oh, these poor babies!
[00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:13.014]  They helped fund the Arab Spring and the overthrow of Ukraine, all the criminal things they do, and now bombs are there.
[00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:14.935]  They're such victims.
[00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:19.057]  There are hundreds of cases of declassified false flags.
[00:24:19.337 --> 00:24:20.418]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:28.622]  Everybody knows, you know, about movies and TV shows like House of Cards, where they're throwing bricks through each other's window.
[00:24:28.962 --> 00:24:30.543]  That's one of the oldest tricks in the book.
[00:24:31.924 --> 00:24:33.204]  And so I've predicted it all.
[00:24:33.264 --> 00:24:34.285]  It isn't hard to predict.
[00:24:36.121 --> 00:24:37.642]  Because you can see the massive rollout.
[00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:43.966]  They don't go on every news channel in the country.
[00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:54.914]  They don't go through every news channel of fake news in the country and all say in unison, Alex Jones, I've got chills, Lester Holt said.
[00:24:54.934 --> 00:25:01.619]  Yeah, I'm really scared when he said kill us with bombs or kill us with guns and battle rifles.
[00:25:03.263 --> 00:25:06.584]  Jack Dorsey goes, I know, I know it's terrible, but we're not going to ban him yet.
[00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:10.845]  To make it act like they're not censoring.
[00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:11.765]  Oh, they held back.
[00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:15.146]  So he could go around and do that whole tour of disinformation.
[00:25:15.466 --> 00:25:27.790]  A PSYOP, you know when they're on every channel saying you're saying kill the media, and you didn't say it, and they don't have proof you said it, that something bad is about to happen.
[00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.550]  They don't go for broke like that.
[00:25:30.871 --> 00:25:32.271]  They don't tell lies that big.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.204]  Unless they're getting ready to attack themselves with bombs and guns.
[00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:39.606]  And poison.
[00:25:42.448 --> 00:25:52.418]  And we're putting together an article on Infowars.com, it's gonna be out later, that's gonna have dozens and dozens of videos and articles, the last year where I warranted this, where you could see the pre-programming.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.883]  And just like I said, how do you know when a new Coca-Cola flavor's coming out?
[00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:02.076]  Because you see billboards everywhere, and there's ads on radio and TV.
[00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:04.839]  And you go, oh, there's a new Coke coming out.
[00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:06.941]  Or, when does McRib come back?
[00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:09.763]  You don't go to McDonald's, I don't go to McDonald's, you see the stupid McRib ads.
[00:26:10.044 --> 00:26:11.926]  McRib is back for a limited time!
[00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:14.108]  That means they've got McRibs at McDonald's!
[00:26:15.558 --> 00:26:41.608]  When they come out and they say, Alex Jones says blow up and shoot the media, and Trump says kill the media, and it's not true, and they've got a history of staging crap, and they're a pack of criminals that works with radical Islam, you name it, and say MS-13 are God's children, you better believe these scumbags in the deep state haven't given up, and they don't want America to return, and they don't want our republic back, so they're crapping their filthy britches, and they're gonna pull anything!
[00:26:42.662 --> 00:26:45.244]  And if we can't see the giant set up to this, we're crazy.
[00:26:46.164 --> 00:26:50.988]  You don't just think we were going to take the country back, and they weren't going to fight back against this, do you?
[00:26:51.248 --> 00:26:54.310]  We are removing the globalists and the chi-coms from the country.
[00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.751]  We're restoring the republic.
[00:26:56.651 --> 00:26:57.952]  And we're going to get demonized.
[00:26:58.212 --> 00:26:59.193]  We're going to get attacked.
[00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:00.554]  I expect to be attacked.
[00:27:02.108 --> 00:27:04.409]  But I expect you to be smart and know what's going on.
[00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:11.733]  So, Alex Jones says InfoWars platform bans are first step in globalist plot to carry out violent false flags against CNN, MSNBC.
[00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:15.916]  That's Media Matters memorializing what I said on August 6th.
[00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:16.416]  Here's part of it.
[00:27:18.968 --> 00:27:20.769]  What's the next step in their censorship plan?
[00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:21.610]  I can tell you.
[00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.072]  They're going to stage false flag terror attacks.
[00:27:24.773 --> 00:27:26.494]  They're going to stage events against the media.
[00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:28.135]  We told you this was coming.
[00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:31.658]  They're going to say that Trump criticizing their lies is going to cause the violence.
[00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:37.583]  And they're going to directly, though, pin the probably mass shooting and bombing attacks on Infowars.
[00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:40.806]  Now, I'd already been getting this chatter.
[00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:48.103]  I can see CNN and others hyping it up, that I'm going to cause violence, that Trump's going to cause violence.
[00:27:48.443 --> 00:27:49.904]  I can see Brian Stelter yesterday.
[00:27:49.924 --> 00:27:53.746]  Let's make sure we have that clip for the next segment, where he plays the segment off C-SPAN.
[00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:55.827]  He says, oh, everybody's coming to try to get me.
[00:27:55.847 --> 00:27:57.208]  The whole thing's soundstage.
[00:27:57.528 --> 00:28:03.612]  This is all they have left now, is to say our speech is bad and that we have to be taken down.
[00:28:05.493 --> 00:28:06.294]  So understand that's...
[00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:14.131]  Now when we come back, I'm gonna get into the caravan, the economy, the latest election news, all of it.
[00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:20.272]  But when we do the second hour, I'm gonna play Mike Adams predicting it all, I'm predicting it all, but understand, here's the big emergency.
[00:28:21.273 --> 00:28:31.715]  These are only probing attacks to set it up and to test the public, will they buy that Soros and Hillary and Bill and Obama and she and her poor victims, this is introducing them as the targets.
[00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:36.976]  They can whine and moan and predict, if Trump doesn't stop, you're gonna get us all killed!
[00:28:37.556 --> 00:28:37.996]  And then,
[00:28:39.215 --> 00:28:45.000]  You know, it's been said that a lot of people miss the forest for the trees.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.321]  And I'm one of those people.
[00:29:07.662 --> 00:29:12.185]  I just want to tell the viewers and listeners of InfoWars that you've changed the world.
[00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:26.695]  And the globalists want to shut down InfoWars because it's a place where we can come together and share ideas and where we have culture, where we have kinship, where we are able to interface and realize how similar we really are.
[00:29:27.636 --> 00:29:29.377]  It's a place where we know that we're not alone.
[00:29:31.172 --> 00:29:37.516]  And that's why they filed fake lawsuits against us and written hundreds of thousands of fake news stories that have been syndicated across the world.
[00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:43.760]  It's why they've got HBO and Showtime shows with characters based on me that do horrible, evil, racist things.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.225]  But that said, I wanted to just celebrate the fact that, yeah, we're under attack now, and we'll be under attack in the future.
[00:29:52.449 --> 00:29:58.751]  But the globalists are trying to punish Infowars for what you did, what I did, what others did in the past.
[00:29:59.572 --> 00:30:06.394]  So they're literally fighting a past war, like generals always do, instead of fighting the new war.
[00:30:07.395 --> 00:30:14.177]  So, at so many levels, they're already winning when I debate them, or I confront them, or I try to counter their lies.
[00:30:14.737 --> 00:30:15.638]  They can only disrupt.
[00:30:16.618 --> 00:30:24.125]  And it's important to say where they're lying, but to move on with our truths and the things that we're saying that they're trying to silence.
[00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:29.791]  They tell all these lies because they want us to then debate them for our honor.
[00:30:31.092 --> 00:30:31.993]  But they're dishonorable.
[00:30:32.273 --> 00:30:33.434]  They've been proven to be liars.
[00:30:34.355 --> 00:30:35.937]  Our answer is, you're a pack of liars.
[00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:37.398]  Here's my idea.
[00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.021]  Here's what I'm promoting, that you don't want to be hurt.
[00:30:40.845 --> 00:30:44.608]  And that's what's happening at InfoWars.com from 8 a.m.
[00:30:44.748 --> 00:30:48.512]  past 10 o'clock at night, every night now, with live broadcast.
[00:30:48.992 --> 00:31:05.166]  Our election coverage, David Knight, Owen Schroer, myself, and so many others, bringing you true, truth-based information that comes from research and historical understanding and proven sources, not from globalist talking points of disinformation.
[00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:08.489]  But in closing, it takes a lot of money to carry out this fight.
[00:31:09.109 --> 00:31:11.070]  They're trying to shut down our payment processors right now.
[00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.491]  They're trying to shut down our shopping carts.
[00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:15.653]  But as long as your order gets through, it'll be shipped out.
[00:31:16.033 --> 00:31:19.615]  And that's why we've got the biggest sale in our history.
[00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:21.096]  50% off and free shipping.
[00:31:21.116 --> 00:31:23.037]  Free shipping storewide, 50% off on the supplements.
[00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:29.859]  A lot of products like air filtration, water filtration, don't have 50% markup in them, so we can't do that.
[00:31:29.879 --> 00:31:36.220]  But they've got 10%, 25%, 35% on the highest quality storable food for the price you're going to pay.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.981]  There's a nexus point.
[00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:40.201]  You can pay even more and get something technically better if you pay three times more.
[00:31:40.221 --> 00:31:44.682]  But for the price, being affordable but still being quality, it's that nexus point.
[00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:45.302]  It's the best.
[00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:49.563]  And for select, the water filtration, the very best, super high quality.
[00:31:50.383 --> 00:31:50.923]  It's all there.
[00:31:51.584 --> 00:31:52.664]  And store-wide free shipping.
[00:31:54.064 --> 00:32:00.048]  50% off, so that in case they're able to shut down our merchant accounts, before then, you're able to get the products.
[00:32:00.068 --> 00:32:03.750]  So Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, all rolled into one.
[00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.132]  I think we'll make it through this, thanks to your prayers.
[00:32:06.172 --> 00:32:09.894]  The fact there's still some free market left in this country, but let's not count on that.
[00:32:10.254 --> 00:32:17.259]  Let's make sure InfoWars is provisioned for the next few months, with your funding and 360Win, you get great products.
[00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:25.301]  Free shipping store-wide, InformaStore.com, 50% off on all the supplements, 35% off on high-quality, storable foods, and so much more.
[00:32:25.722 --> 00:32:31.203]  Take action today, buy the War Bonds, and we've already proven we'll change history together.
[00:32:31.603 --> 00:32:32.924]  Can I plug your products real quick?
[00:32:32.964 --> 00:32:35.985]  Just bought a bunch for the 50% off super sale.
[00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:37.545]  I stocked up on my X2.
[00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:45.568]  Then also, the real Red Pill Plus, I think, is underrated, because if ever I need energy, like to work out or whatever, I take four of those bad boys and I'm good to go.
[00:32:45.868 --> 00:32:53.314]  Well, I've been taking your products probably the past two, three years, but the past year and a half, it's really helped me a lot, a lot.
[00:32:53.555 --> 00:32:58.839]  If anybody's looking for a product you want to feel, literally, the knockout, dude, every time.
[00:33:03.884 --> 00:33:06.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.642 --> 00:33:21.303]  Big Brother.
[00:33:21.784 --> 00:33:23.065]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:24.547]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:25.488 --> 00:33:26.889]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:28.451]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:28.931 --> 00:33:35.198]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:59.455]  I mean, to watch them hype up violence in this country and promote anti for mainstream media, and then point their fingers at us and say we're hyping the violence, show when the violence comes to the media, we know it's coming, they're hyping it like it's going to happen.
[00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:04.079]  Well, you know, we have to take over and have to ban free speech because people are going to be mean to the mainstream media.
[00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.641]  And Jones is saying come after the media with violence.
[00:34:08.163 --> 00:34:09.664]  That's the last thing I want.
[00:34:12.102 --> 00:34:14.063]  And they know that.
[00:34:17.546 --> 00:34:20.868]  So that was back in the middle of August, and I've got a bunch more of these clips.
[00:34:21.788 --> 00:34:23.089]  What did I say at the start of the show?
[00:34:23.189 --> 00:34:23.690]  Second segment.
[00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:33.716]  Ten minutes into the show, I said, I expect a bunch of other fake pipe bombs to be mailed to other Democrats' offices so they can all be victims.
[00:34:34.236 --> 00:34:37.959]  Bomb Squad investigates suspicious package at Wasserman Schultz's office.
[00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:42.440]  And it just continues on from there.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:49.203]  So there's no investigation of her and the O'Wan brothers and the laptops and all the rest of it because see, she's a victim now.
[00:34:49.523 --> 00:34:51.124]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:34:51.724 --> 00:34:52.585]  It's all their fault.
[00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:55.206]  And you know, that's guaranteed to be all over the news.
[00:34:55.506 --> 00:34:59.788]  If it isn't already all over the news, I guarantee it'll be on the news soon.
[00:35:00.949 --> 00:35:03.430]  Bomb Squad investigates suspicious package at Washburn Shultz's office.
[00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.051]  So how long till they bring in the patsy?
[00:35:06.972 --> 00:35:09.193]  And how long until the minute he's arrested?
[00:35:10.049 --> 00:35:16.072]  We hear that he was at the re-elect campaign of Donald Trump and at Infowars.com.
[00:35:19.254 --> 00:35:20.795]  How obvious is this going to have to get?
[00:35:20.895 --> 00:35:22.996]  I want to get into the migrant caravan.
[00:35:24.196 --> 00:35:26.438]  Not walking, they're being transported to the U.S.
[00:35:26.538 --> 00:35:31.200]  border on the back of flatbed trucks paid for by USID.
[00:35:33.137 --> 00:35:34.477]  You know, why can't Trump stop that?
[00:35:34.537 --> 00:35:35.778]  Because we give our money to the U.N.
[00:35:36.378 --> 00:35:40.459]  They give it to the NGOs, like George Soros and the Carnegie Foundation.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.180]  That's all coming up.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:43.720]  Stunning!
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.582]  Photo evidence shows caravan migrants carrying USAID bags, paid for by U.S.
[00:35:48.642 --> 00:35:49.202]  taxpayers.
[00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:53.983]  Mexican news outlet, 14,000 Honduran migrants heading to the U.S.
[00:35:54.184 --> 00:35:55.664]  Remember, they told you it was 200 last Friday.
[00:35:55.704 --> 00:35:56.184]  I told you it was 20,000.
[00:35:56.224 --> 00:35:56.604]  It's 50,000.
[00:36:00.532 --> 00:36:03.513]  Suicide surges in hopeless Venezuela.
[00:36:03.553 --> 00:36:04.894]  Well, I'm sure that's America's fault.
[00:36:06.094 --> 00:36:08.995]  How'd the migrant caravan become so big and why is it continuing to grow?
[00:36:10.716 --> 00:36:15.097]  Trump administration has not settled on a plan for what to do if the migrant caravan arrives in the U.S.
[00:36:15.117 --> 00:36:15.417]  border.
[00:36:15.437 --> 00:36:19.759]  Reportedly fistfights between John Bolton and General Kelly.
[00:36:21.127 --> 00:36:23.468]  Kelly, by the way, is the expert on that former head of Southcom.
[00:36:24.529 --> 00:36:29.491]  2,100 mostly unarmed guard troops on border as Trump vows to send more to stop migrant caravan.
[00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:34.994]  And they'll attack just like they did the Mexican police and the media will say, how dare you do this?
[00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:38.896]  We see our corporate traitor media that says you can't even say the word nationalist.
[00:36:40.236 --> 00:36:47.840]  Rolling out the red carpet to the migrants and NPR this morning, I was listening to it driving to work, was saying how it was the best thing in the world.
[00:36:49.568 --> 00:36:52.149]  And how we just need to be totally open and have no borders.
[00:36:52.469 --> 00:36:54.130]  You've got Hollywood running around saying that.
[00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.932]  That's all coming up with the video and more next segment.
[00:36:57.152 --> 00:37:08.257]  But whatever you do, they censored and they blocked and they tried to shut down Infowars ahead of the midterms and ahead of the last two weeks.
[00:37:09.578 --> 00:37:11.339]  What did I say in show after show?
[00:37:11.379 --> 00:37:15.101]  I said in the last two weeks because I've watched what the globalists do in other countries.
[00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:27.607]  They launch overthrows of governments during elections so they can confuse it all and when the public is the most hyped up and the most divided so they can create a national emergency and remove the president.
[00:37:28.247 --> 00:37:31.748]  Soros is an expert at this and has done this in more than 20 countries.
[00:37:33.588 --> 00:37:35.649]  He's trying to crash the dollar right now.
[00:37:35.989 --> 00:37:38.029]  He's trying to crash your pension funds right now.
[00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:42.490]  He's working to bring down this country right now with all these other globalist groups.
[00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:54.873]  I've got stacks of mainstream news admitting that it's the Carnegie and the Ford and the Rockefeller and the MacArthur Foundation and the Open Societies Foundation getting money from the UN to run it.
[00:37:56.855 --> 00:38:01.540]  And the UN sets up the refugee centers and has the executive power through agreements to do this.
[00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.931]  So right on time, the bombs get mailed.
[00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:11.573]  What did I say just two Sundays ago?
[00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:14.935]  I remember on the show saying, they're loading the bombs.
[00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:18.277]  They're preparing to mail the bombs right now.
[00:38:18.297 --> 00:38:20.219]  We haven't found that clip yet, but you heard me say it.
[00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:21.860]  They're loading the bombs.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.901]  They're loading the bombs.
[00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:31.446]  I said it a month ago, just days before they busted a guy with a 200 pound bomb to blow up conservatives on election day to cancel the election.
[00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:33.621]  What do I tell you?
[00:38:33.641 --> 00:38:35.142]  Over and over again, they want civil unrest.
[00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:35.883]  They want murder.
[00:38:36.163 --> 00:38:36.863]  They want death.
[00:38:38.484 --> 00:38:43.548]  Let's go to a few clips here from September 14th and October 10th.
[00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:44.488]  Two different clips.
[00:38:44.508 --> 00:38:44.828]  Here they are.
[00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:49.011]  I don't know if it's going to be truck bombs or machine gun attacks.
[00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:49.711]  I don't know what it is.
[00:38:49.731 --> 00:38:52.073]  They're getting ready to blow the living snot out of themselves.
[00:38:52.093 --> 00:38:53.814]  And when it happens,
[00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.171]  Get out there and cover it all.
[00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:01.953]  That's why they said, oh my god, he said Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:39:02.274 --> 00:39:03.114]  Which I did question.
[00:39:03.315 --> 00:39:05.957]  Then they said, I said Parkland didn't happen, which I did not question.
[00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:07.438]  Because we knew it was police stand down.
[00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:10.881]  Because they want it where I'm not listened to when they pull this.
[00:39:12.743 --> 00:39:19.749]  Because they're going to blame Alex Jones, Alex E. Jones, and DJ T. DJ T.
[00:39:23.366 --> 00:39:24.067]  It's confirmed.
[00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:26.388]  The left is activating their sleeper cells.
[00:39:26.428 --> 00:39:31.930]  They are preparing to stage terror attacks in the next 26 days, and it's only meant to escalate from there.
[00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:34.672]  The globalists don't even care if they win the midterms.
[00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:47.618]  They want to create a national emergency to try to drive Trump and the patriots out of the government, because they know that we're bringing the country back, and the prosperity is the ultimate trump card against the globalists.
[00:39:47.938 --> 00:39:49.899]  So they are now about to make their move.
[00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:50.900]  But thank God.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:58.102]  Trump and the patriots that we do have in the government are aware of this and are stopping these terror attacks before they take place.
[00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.763]  The only question is, can we stop them all?
[00:40:01.063 --> 00:40:02.523]  This guy is the classic cutout.
[00:40:02.543 --> 00:40:03.783]  I've done a lot of research on him.
[00:40:04.204 --> 00:40:05.864]  Classic cutout decoy.
[00:40:07.244 --> 00:40:13.766]  A mental patient who they would have out there with a bomb, who they would then load up with pro-Trump paraphernalia, you name it.
[00:40:14.446 --> 00:40:15.967]  There's a lot of different angles they could go with.
[00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:19.500]  The globalists tell you how they even do this.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:25.843]  Remember the movie Arlington Road, where they trick the professor to think he's going to stop the terror attack, but then he actually gets blamed for it?
[00:40:25.863 --> 00:40:28.184]  That's exactly what they did with McVeigh.
[00:40:28.584 --> 00:40:31.665]  He was there trying to go around setting up militias to stop terror attacks.
[00:40:32.225 --> 00:40:38.908]  When they said they were going to go ahead and carry out a real one, he blew the whistle, tried to stop it, they drugged him up, and the rest is history, and it all came out in court.
[00:40:39.128 --> 00:40:40.049]  But that's a side issue.
[00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:42.390]  Let me go over this article for you right now.
[00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:51.045]  That was, of course, the gentleman a few weeks ago that was going to blow up the National Mall.
[00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:54.787]  We have a lot of other even more detailed clips that I'm told they've grabbed.
[00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:55.808]  We'll have those in the next hour.
[00:40:55.908 --> 00:40:56.748]  Mike Adams joins us.
[00:40:57.228 --> 00:40:58.529]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.251]  I'm trying to alert you so you know what's going on.
[00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:06.094]  That's why they clamp down on us and thousands and thousands of other conservatives and libertarian groups.
[00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:11.658]  That's why they're censoring everybody because they don't want us to be able to communicate and share information
[00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.050]  When the big event happens.
[00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.571]  And they're going to blame us.
[00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:19.112]  And they're going to then have the left riot in the streets.
[00:41:19.492 --> 00:41:26.894]  They're going to assail the borders with hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens pouring across in a total destabilization.
[00:41:27.214 --> 00:41:28.874]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:41:30.295 --> 00:41:34.356]  Because of nuclear weapons, you can't have a toe-to-toe war with a major nation.
[00:41:34.996 --> 00:41:36.376]  They do it through open borders.
[00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:37.637]  They do it through subterfuge.
[00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:39.217]  They do it through sabotage.
[00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:42.673]  I believe we're going to make it through this election.
[00:41:42.814 --> 00:41:43.734]  I believe we're going to stop it.
[00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:49.875]  I believe they're only doing probing simulated attacks because they know a big attack, they'll still get caught doing it.
[00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:53.416]  They haven't been able to shut down the communications properly.
[00:41:54.317 --> 00:41:56.597]  I believe that we're going to make it through this.
[00:41:57.317 --> 00:41:59.478]  And I believe they may stop with just these probes.
[00:41:59.718 --> 00:42:00.678]  But I could be wrong.
[00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:06.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, if an explosion goes off, you go there with a camera.
[00:42:08.575 --> 00:42:10.456]  If anything looks suspicious, you videotape it.
[00:42:10.496 --> 00:42:12.137]  You watch everything now.
[00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:16.459]  If I was General Citizens, I would be as independent media patrolling at night.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.100]  I'd be patrolling in the morning.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.683]  I would be looking everywhere you're at, especially if you work in an international media institution.
[00:42:23.443 --> 00:42:30.687]  You know, I don't think they're going to kill their own CIA operatives like Anderson Cooper, who's a middle-east CIA involved in black ops and disinfo and government overthrows all over the world.
[00:42:31.167 --> 00:42:34.069]  They'll roll it in to some event though with a bunch of media and kill them.
[00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.070]  The deep state will.
[00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:36.991]  And so,
[00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.733]  I'm telling you, especially media, universities, and Democratic Party facilities.
[00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:48.018]  If you're at a big Democratic facility, and you suddenly see all the executives gone one morning, get out!
[00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:48.539]  Get out!
[00:42:48.759 --> 00:42:49.099]  Get out!
[00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:49.820]  Just like OKC.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.943]  They're going to be across town, because they know that truck bomb's rolling up.
[00:42:54.343 --> 00:42:54.944]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.964 --> 00:42:56.005]  This is an emergency broadcast.
[00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:05.353]  Senator Warren's family has long told stories that they have some Native American heritage.
[00:43:05.373 --> 00:43:08.675]  Now some people don't believe that and his name is Donald Trump.
[00:43:09.135 --> 00:43:16.221]  Breaking news this morning, Senator Elizabeth Warren has released results of a DNA test showing she does have Native American ancestry.
[00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:26.228]  Massachusetts Senator and possible presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren released results of a DNA test she says proves she has some Native American heritage.
[00:43:26.408 --> 00:43:29.550]  Strong evidence that she has Native American heritage.
[00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.112]  DNA analysis proves she has Native American heritage.
[00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:37.354]  Elizabeth Warren can now officially say that she is part Native American.
[00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:40.656]  It's past time to separate politics from fact.
[00:43:41.157 --> 00:43:46.720]  And the fact is, the people calling Warren a liar just don't have a leg to stand on.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:54.022]  President Trump, who calls her Pocahontas, has suggested he would pay a million dollars to a charity if she took a DNA test to prove her heritage.
[00:43:54.042 --> 00:43:56.783]  When told of the test results today, here's what President Trump said.
[00:43:57.123 --> 00:43:57.723]  Who cares?
[00:43:58.763 --> 00:43:59.304]  Who cares?
[00:43:59.544 --> 00:43:59.984]  Who cares?
[00:44:00.084 --> 00:44:00.584]  Who cares?
[00:44:00.684 --> 00:44:01.244]  You care!
[00:44:01.344 --> 00:44:02.044]  You care!
[00:44:02.344 --> 00:44:05.045]  You're literally the only person who cares!
[00:44:05.065 --> 00:44:14.348]  I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test that it shows you're an Indian.
[00:44:16.882 --> 00:44:25.115]  Donald Trump promised he'd donate $1 million to charity if Senator Elizabeth Warren could prove she had Native American ancestry.
[00:44:25.255 --> 00:44:27.499]  Well, the DNA results are in!
[00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:31.553]  Yes, she is!
[00:44:32.534 --> 00:44:37.056]  Even though Elizabeth Warren took the test, now he says he's not going to pay the million dollars.
[00:44:37.256 --> 00:44:43.359]  When confronted about his million dollar pledge this afternoon, he chickened out.
[00:44:43.399 --> 00:44:45.440]  The president is scoffing at the results.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.160]  How much?
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.160]  One one thousand?
[00:44:47.621 --> 00:44:48.941]  Do you owe her an apology?
[00:44:48.981 --> 00:44:50.202]  No, absolutely not.
[00:44:50.282 --> 00:44:50.822]  I owe her.
[00:44:50.842 --> 00:44:52.283]  She owes the country an apology.
[00:44:52.383 --> 00:44:54.664]  We don't have to wait for the president's DNA.
[00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:55.444]  He is 100% douche.
[00:44:59.804 --> 00:45:01.625]  Elizabeth Warren taking the bait.
[00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:05.766]  Now, the president likes to call my mom a liar.
[00:45:06.206 --> 00:45:07.427]  What do the facts say?
[00:45:07.447 --> 00:45:11.448]  The facts suggest that you could absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree.
[00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:13.709]  This is absolute pure bull.
[00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:16.310]  Don't believe the crap you see from these people.
[00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.431]  The fake news.
[00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:19.712]  I'm an Indian outlaw.
[00:45:20.452 --> 00:45:22.533]  Half Cherokee and Choctaw.
[00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:24.254]  My baby, she's a Chippewa.
[00:45:24.774 --> 00:45:26.075]  She's a one-of-a-kind.
[00:45:26.255 --> 00:45:31.197]  Elizabeth Warren is whiter than your average white person.
[00:45:31.297 --> 00:45:36.460]  My papa had high cheekbones, like all of the Indians do.
[00:45:39.548 --> 00:45:42.929]  Bocahontas is on the warpath.
[00:45:42.989 --> 00:45:44.330]  They call her Bocahontas.
[00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.171]  Bocahontas.
[00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:48.012]  What does Warren translate into Cherokee as?
[00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:48.793]  Spreading bull?
[00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:59.959]  If Senator Warren sets the standard, you too could claim a minority preference.
[00:45:59.999 --> 00:46:04.061]  But I knew my father's family didn't like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware.
[00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.962]  So my parents had to allow it.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.926]  Most white Americans have more Native American blood than Senator Warren.
[00:46:21.086 --> 00:46:23.809]  She's potentially 1, 1000th and 24th Indian, which is 0.09%.
[00:46:29.744 --> 00:46:33.745]  I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage.
[00:46:33.905 --> 00:46:38.687]  The university actually celebrated her as the first minority woman to receive tenure.
[00:46:38.987 --> 00:46:43.048]  Warren posed as a victim because on the left, victimhood is power.
[00:46:43.228 --> 00:46:44.829]  Warren is trying to play the victim.
[00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:46.209]  I'm 13% victim.
[00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.010]  I'm 21% victim.
[00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:53.152]  Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you, DNA and me.
[00:46:53.952 --> 00:46:54.492]  Are you in?
[00:46:55.452 --> 00:46:56.633]  Hell f***ing yes I'm in.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.482]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:17.150]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.432]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:47:23.034 --> 00:47:30.240]  There is a saying, a maxim in Latin, or the old Roman, Quibono,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.140]  Key Bono.
[00:47:33.861 --> 00:47:34.842]  Who benefits?
[00:47:35.422 --> 00:47:36.323]  Who stands to gain?
[00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:39.965]  But you also have to ask, who has a history of doing something?
[00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:41.946]  Who has the capacity to do it?
[00:47:43.007 --> 00:47:44.028]  And again, who benefits from it?
[00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:50.072]  You know, you see this in different crime shows and I've read about it in criminology.
[00:47:51.733 --> 00:47:53.254]  Most firefighters are really great people.
[00:47:55.075 --> 00:47:58.417]  But generally when there's some junior firefighter and they
[00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:22.507]  See a house that's burning down first, it happens a couple times and they respond first, or they find a pipe bomb and defuse it and are the hero, the cops start watching them and they're the ones that have done the pipe bomb, or the poop swastika, I mean, or the little cross at the yard, or go away n-words at the Air Force Academy, and I said it's probably a leftist cadet, and it was!
[00:48:23.187 --> 00:48:24.769]  Almost every time it is, actually.
[00:48:27.981 --> 00:48:29.922]  We're not supposed to talk about that or think about that.
[00:48:29.962 --> 00:48:31.624]  We're supposed to not think about who benefits.
[00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:37.968]  From now, as I said at the start of the show, I believe you'll have a whole bunch of these pipe bombs mailed to all the little Democrats.
[00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:48.375]  They started with the big prince himself, George Soros, the big granddaddy, the biggest contributor, the biggest funder, why he got the bomb.
[00:48:49.216 --> 00:48:53.099]  And everybody speculates who sent the little four-inch long pipe bomb.
[00:48:56.385 --> 00:49:00.829]  This guy funds burning down whole cities and killing the police in different nations.
[00:49:00.869 --> 00:49:01.209]  Look it up.
[00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:01.910]  He brags about it.
[00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:07.294]  And then, oh, it's Hillary and Bill.
[00:49:07.354 --> 00:49:08.275]  It's down the hierarchy.
[00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:09.536]  And then it's Obama.
[00:49:10.296 --> 00:49:13.379]  And then it's Debbie Washerman Schultz, who's got a bunch of heat on her.
[00:49:13.419 --> 00:49:15.140]  And then it's Eric Holder.
[00:49:18.603 --> 00:49:20.345]  And then it's Kamala Harris.
[00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:33.435]  They all get to be in the news and get to be victims now with the perfect narrative of the media, the corporate media saying Donald J. Trump and these congressmen, they're all going to cause violence.
[00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:35.496]  Alex Jones is calling for it when it wasn't true.
[00:49:36.896 --> 00:49:43.919]  And the editor of major publications like Raw Story saying Scalise deserved what he got.
[00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:45.520]  You know, we were defending ourselves.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.542]  And CNN's Wolf Blitzer has guest on saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero.
[00:49:56.337 --> 00:49:57.057]  See how that works?
[00:49:58.498 --> 00:49:59.518]  See how these people operate?
[00:49:59.558 --> 00:50:01.019]  And it's right in front of your face.
[00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:10.804]  And they want me off the air, ahead of the Deep State group they've got, branding that the left is under attack, when they're the ones calling for all the violence, they're the ones carrying it all out.
[00:50:11.224 --> 00:50:13.825]  CNN's saying, well, the cops are getting killed because cops are bad.
[00:50:13.845 --> 00:50:19.167]  And really, if a cop does something bad, reportedly, in another state, shooting a cop in the back of the head's okay.
[00:50:19.547 --> 00:50:21.288]  They're the ones trying to destabilize the country.
[00:50:21.468 --> 00:50:24.870]  They're the ones saying, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:50:26.052 --> 00:50:28.754]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[00:50:29.055 --> 00:50:31.297]  And now they've got big brand new 18 wheelers.
[00:50:32.418 --> 00:50:33.038]  Flatbacks.
[00:50:34.259 --> 00:50:40.065]  Piled up with people on big old super highways driving up to the US border.
[00:50:41.186 --> 00:50:45.570]  And there's all these, and waving their Honduran and Nicaraguan.
[00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:49.337]  And Panamanian flags.
[00:50:49.778 --> 00:50:50.378]  Woo!
[00:50:51.199 --> 00:50:53.321]  And saying Trump is the Antichrist.
[00:50:53.642 --> 00:50:54.963]  And burning American flags.
[00:50:55.303 --> 00:50:55.824]  Yeah!
[00:50:56.744 --> 00:50:58.226]  And all these Hollywood people came out.
[00:50:58.246 --> 00:50:59.127]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:50:59.567 --> 00:51:00.588]  And they're saying the same thing.
[00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:01.189]  No borders.
[00:51:01.389 --> 00:51:01.949]  No walls.
[00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.371]  No USA at all.
[00:51:05.092 --> 00:51:10.077]  Then they have Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo and Rachel Maddow.
[00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:10.678]  I think I asked...
[00:51:12.034 --> 00:51:13.414]  The crew back there did a compilation of that.
[00:51:13.454 --> 00:51:16.755]  It's in the article by Steve Watson.
[00:51:16.795 --> 00:51:17.715]  Trump is Hitler.
[00:51:17.915 --> 00:51:23.177]  Unhinged Democrats and leftist media call POTUS fascist dictator for putting America first.
[00:51:24.957 --> 00:51:27.758]  And they shake their head and they said, he said we're a nation.
[00:51:29.118 --> 00:51:30.759]  He said we have a country.
[00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:32.579]  That's mind control, folks.
[00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:35.460]  Acting like something totally normal is bad.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.221]  See, but they're a pack of liars that have gotten away with everything.
[00:51:40.021 --> 00:51:40.861]  So why shouldn't they?
[00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:46.059]  Google's in big trouble for illegal spying, so's Facebook, so's Apple.
[00:51:46.279 --> 00:51:50.064]  Apple's led the way spying on their users and selling the data, even giving it to the Chinese government.
[00:51:50.464 --> 00:51:52.006]  So Tim Cook's out trying to damage control.
[00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:56.091]  And notice the head of the Trump campaign, who I've been a little critical of...
[00:51:57.944 --> 00:51:59.585]  He's like, I don't want to comment on the censorship.
[00:51:59.605 --> 00:52:00.665]  The White House may do something.
[00:52:00.725 --> 00:52:01.365]  I can't comment.
[00:52:01.686 --> 00:52:03.266]  I'm like, come on, you need to comment.
[00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:04.147]  And he wouldn't give me one.
[00:52:04.167 --> 00:52:06.908]  So I kind of got mad at Parcells a little bit and said that.
[00:52:06.968 --> 00:52:07.848]  But I left it at that.
[00:52:08.669 --> 00:52:14.911]  Little did I know the next day, a huge Breitbart article and a bunch and he gave a bunch of speeches saying they're meddling in the election.
[00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:16.252]  They're authoritarian.
[00:52:16.272 --> 00:52:16.892]  They're dangerous.
[00:52:16.952 --> 00:52:18.073]  And the president needs to act.
[00:52:18.153 --> 00:52:18.613]  So good.
[00:52:19.473 --> 00:52:23.295]  I guess just strategically, they didn't want to tell us that.
[00:52:24.514 --> 00:52:26.654]  When we ran into him at the Trump event, which is fine.
[00:52:27.095 --> 00:52:27.875]  All I want is action.
[00:52:30.835 --> 00:52:31.716]  We got an interview with him.
[00:52:31.776 --> 00:52:34.376]  I just thought it made him look stupid, so I wasn't going to air it.
[00:52:34.396 --> 00:52:35.136]  I was just disappointed.
[00:52:35.176 --> 00:52:35.836]  But hey, good job.
[00:52:36.997 --> 00:52:38.297]  I've been told you're a great guy.
[00:52:38.317 --> 00:52:41.738]  I've met people in the campaign and the president and everything, so I'm sure you know what's going on.
[00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:45.658]  But for whatever strategic reason, I guess you didn't want to break that news that Infowars is getting demonized.
[00:52:45.698 --> 00:52:47.779]  But you've got to dance with who brung you, bro.
[00:52:47.799 --> 00:52:52.820]  They're trying to destroy me and your boss because we're Americana and we're fearless and we're rebooting it.
[00:52:53.854 --> 00:52:54.794]  I'm sure you know what you're doing.
[00:52:55.295 --> 00:52:58.176]  The point is that InfoWars is standing against these globalists right now.
[00:52:59.797 --> 00:53:06.520]  Now here I am with Mike Adams again in October.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.840]  When we come back, I'm going to play the clip.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:13.943]  I'm going to give you the exact date, but it was in the fourth hour where we lay it all out really brilliantly.
[00:53:14.783 --> 00:53:17.925]  And Mike Adams will be joining us next hour, but I want to explain something.
[00:53:18.931 --> 00:53:31.816]  This means they're considering major terror attacks against themselves and that all the pre-programming to get that ready is for a good reason and that 2 plus 2 did indeed equal 4.
[00:53:34.337 --> 00:53:37.198]  In fact, we're not even looking at 2 plus 2 now.
[00:53:37.238 --> 00:53:40.000]  We're looking at the word go with a green light.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.721]  Now that doesn't mean they're still going to pull it.
[00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:45.462]  They want us shut up
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.562]  Because they don't want us on their tail!
[00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:50.944]  Because they know I've got their number!
[00:53:52.025 --> 00:53:53.226]  And they know I'll never back off.
[00:53:53.266 --> 00:53:59.030]  You don't think I haven't had the olive branches reached out to me even recently by the Clintons?
[00:53:59.871 --> 00:54:00.051]  Yeah.
[00:54:01.252 --> 00:54:02.193]  Off-record discussion, so.
[00:54:03.694 --> 00:54:09.259]  People that are well-known good friends of theirs that just so happen to be conservatives.
[00:54:10.353 --> 00:54:12.073]  You don't think I've had the phone call?
[00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:13.114]  Said, is that enough?
[00:54:13.374 --> 00:54:14.154]  You gonna tap out?
[00:54:14.354 --> 00:54:14.554]  No!
[00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:15.974]  Rip my arm out of the socket.
[00:54:16.134 --> 00:54:16.994]  I'm never tapping out.
[00:54:18.175 --> 00:54:19.615]  Because you people are evil.
[00:54:20.395 --> 00:54:21.595]  And I want you off my back.
[00:54:21.615 --> 00:54:23.576]  And you're not gonna flood us with Islamicists.
[00:54:23.596 --> 00:54:27.276]  You're not gonna teach five-year-olds, you know, that they're really girls, little boys.
[00:54:27.516 --> 00:54:28.317]  I'm sick of it!
[00:54:29.437 --> 00:54:30.797]  I have to get you off my back!
[00:54:31.277 --> 00:54:34.278]  That is... They don't get it.
[00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:36.498]  The pain is having them do this to everybody.
[00:54:37.899 --> 00:54:39.599]  My fighting you is tapping out.
[00:54:40.563 --> 00:54:45.526]  What I'm doing is my death struggle to get free from you, to get my soul away from you.
[00:54:46.306 --> 00:54:47.346]  I did tap out!
[00:54:48.987 --> 00:54:49.488]  You understand?
[00:54:49.508 --> 00:54:50.248]  That's what this is.
[00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:51.168]  Coming up for air.
[00:54:51.869 --> 00:54:52.809]  Fighting for your life.
[00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:55.310]  I don't do this because I hate you.
[00:54:55.571 --> 00:54:59.012]  I do it because I have to get you off my back and my children's back.
[00:54:59.413 --> 00:55:00.013]  You understand that?
[00:55:02.031 --> 00:55:04.093]  So, we've reached the epic fulcrum.
[00:55:04.293 --> 00:55:05.334]  We've reached the jump point.
[00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:06.195]  It's all confirmed.
[00:55:06.215 --> 00:55:07.236]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:55:07.497 --> 00:55:08.798]  Now it's a big giant green light.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.422]  Red sirens on the roof, baby.
[00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.384]  They got the team's red sirens going.
[00:55:15.084 --> 00:55:17.767]  They got the red sirens going in their rooms.
[00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.329]  They got the teams ready.
[00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:21.171]  They got the contractors ready.
[00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:22.912]  They got the bombers and the shooters ready.
[00:55:23.173 --> 00:55:25.135]  And the red sirens are going on the ceiling.
[00:55:26.775 --> 00:55:29.158]  And the dudes are getting ready to march out and get in the trucks.
[00:55:29.498 --> 00:55:33.002]  They're getting ready to go out and march out and get in those planes.
[00:55:34.324 --> 00:55:37.227]  Foreign mercenaries, just like they did with OKC.
[00:55:38.128 --> 00:55:38.689]  They're coming.
[00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:41.092]  Probably use German ones again.
[00:55:41.973 --> 00:55:42.533]  They're coming.
[00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:45.376]  They're coming right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:45.397 --> 00:55:46.157]  You gonna let them do it?
[00:55:47.048 --> 00:55:53.990]  You see Germans that look like they're in the military in a federal building or a Democrat area, you better call the police and get the hell out of there quick.
[00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:58.831]  Because I know of four bombings that they use Germans on, because the Germans will do it.
[00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:02.012]  They frame right-wingers all the time in Germany, even the London Guardian reports on that.
[00:56:02.912 --> 00:56:08.113]  So you better watch your butt for Germans, and they may even use Iranian Hezbollah.
[00:56:09.462 --> 00:56:12.965]  They had cutouts in Oklahoma City where they almost did that as a backup plan.
[00:56:13.265 --> 00:56:17.729]  Because they had some muslims they'd burn if the public didn't buy that it was an army officer.
[00:56:19.742 --> 00:56:20.603]  I'm going to break here.
[00:56:20.623 --> 00:56:22.864]  If I forget to plug to find ourselves, they'll beat us.
[00:56:23.524 --> 00:56:24.825]  Not in this round, but down the road.
[00:56:24.845 --> 00:56:28.427]  If we defeat them this round, we need fuel at the next jump to beat them that level.
[00:56:28.827 --> 00:56:31.509]  We're always fighting the next war while we win this one.
[00:56:31.929 --> 00:56:33.050]  That's how we beat the enemy.
[00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:37.252]  But I need you to flood InfoWarsTore.com with orders.
[00:56:37.292 --> 00:56:38.933]  We've got free shipping still storewide.

[00:56:55.182 --> 00:56:58.643]  And the most important thing is InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:56:59.023 --> 00:57:00.884]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:03.045]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:03.125 --> 00:57:09.267]  Send that link to your email, your text, and say, this guy predicted that they were going to have bombs get sent to all the Democrats.
[00:57:09.427 --> 00:57:10.207]  It's a no-brainer!
[00:57:10.907 --> 00:57:13.008]  This guy, because they're pre-programming!
[00:57:15.356 --> 00:57:19.740]  It's like you see a movie trailer for, you know, First Man.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.542]  You go, oh, there's a movie coming out about Neil Armstrong.
[00:57:22.963 --> 00:57:26.065]  And you go down and you buy a ticket and you walk in and the movie comes on!
[00:57:26.386 --> 00:57:28.067]  They're pre-programming it all!
[00:57:28.427 --> 00:57:29.008]  It's here!
[00:57:29.168 --> 00:57:29.588]  It's here!
[00:57:29.608 --> 00:57:29.588]  100%! 100%!
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.061]  I'm not worried about them blaming it on me or Trump.
[00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:42.904]  I'm worried about the riots, the open borders they're going to hit from every angle, stock market crashes, and they may even set off a low-yield nuclear weapon.
[00:57:43.184 --> 00:57:44.265]  This is it, America!
[00:57:44.705 --> 00:57:45.585]  You want to be slaves?
[00:57:45.645 --> 00:57:46.085]  Lay down!
[00:57:46.406 --> 00:57:47.126]  You want to stop them?
[00:57:47.146 --> 00:57:47.766]  Spread the word!
[00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:48.927]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:48.967 --> 00:57:49.307]  Spread it!
[00:57:56.534 --> 00:57:58.655]  Let's go to Jason in New Mexico.
[00:57:58.715 --> 00:57:59.255]  Fire away.
[00:57:59.315 --> 00:58:00.375]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:58:00.395 --> 00:58:03.176]  Shout out to you, the crew, and all those that work behind the scenes.
[00:58:03.196 --> 00:58:14.219]  And I would tell everybody to commit to the super blue toothpaste and the Survival Shield X2 so you don't turn into a transsexual gay toad and run as a... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:18.680]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.521]  I'm not gonna have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:29.203]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[00:58:29.223 --> 00:58:33.605]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[00:58:33.705 --> 00:58:40.147]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to to see it at work on a daily basis.
[00:58:40.427 --> 00:58:43.988]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[00:58:44.008 --> 00:58:46.549]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[00:58:46.629 --> 00:58:50.871]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[00:58:50.951 --> 00:59:00.594]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product, and I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and the psychologist throw away $10.
[00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.875]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste.
[00:59:03.955 --> 00:59:06.516]  Especially if you love your kids, why would you give them fluoride?
[00:59:07.136 --> 00:59:08.096]  Yeah, yeah, just don't look.
[00:59:08.337 --> 00:59:09.777]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[00:59:09.877 --> 00:59:18.081]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using, and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed.
[00:59:18.381 --> 00:59:24.483]  Contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[00:59:24.824 --> 00:59:26.044]  0.01, harmful if swallowed.
[00:59:26.204 --> 00:59:27.365]  They put that in the water.
[00:59:27.385 --> 00:59:28.745]  Yep, that's if you love the kids, though.
[00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.526]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend your money.
[00:59:30.546 --> 00:59:30.946]  Yeah, you know what?
[00:59:30.966 --> 00:59:31.206]  Good point.
[00:59:31.226 --> 00:59:33.327]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[00:59:33.347 --> 00:59:33.847]  Yeah, that's fine.
[00:59:35.468 --> 00:59:41.233]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[00:59:44.436 --> 00:59:48.659]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:00:17.591 --> 01:00:19.113]  Alright, I'll give you more intel right now.
[01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:23.040]  If they're going operational, it looks like they've green-lighted the whole thing.
[01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:29.189]  In the past, they used Islamic backup groups in case they need to set them up.
[01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:30.651]  They'll usually use...
[01:00:32.276 --> 01:00:40.323]  German intelligence police, assigned to the military, whose specialty is setting up right-wing groups in Germany to stage things like Oklahoma City.
[01:00:41.143 --> 01:00:55.034]  And when the Deputy Attorney General, then Attorney General, now former Attorney General Eric Holder, quarterbacked the Oklahoma City bombing, that all came out in federal court documents, and the names of the people involved, they used German intelligence and other connected groups.
[01:00:56.175 --> 01:00:59.198]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is a maximum red alert.
[01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.148]  Absolute maximum red alert.
[01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:03.429]  Mike Adams is joining me.
[01:01:03.849 --> 01:01:04.930]  They're hitting our borders.
[01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.790]  They're hitting our sovereignty.
[01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:06.871]  They're hitting our stock market.
[01:01:07.211 --> 01:01:12.814]  Canada's working with the Chinese government to put anti-submarine sensors to track our submarine base.
[01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:15.476]  I mean, the whole world's ganged up on us.
[01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:17.277]  This is World War IV.
[01:01:17.417 --> 01:01:20.379]  It's sixth-generational warfare, 21st century.
[01:01:20.399 --> 01:01:23.681]  Now, we've got so many clips the crews found, they've just outdone themselves.
[01:01:24.778 --> 01:01:25.719]  But here's one from August 15th.
[01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:26.440]  Here it is.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.163]  Gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I've ever done in my life.
[01:01:43.462 --> 01:01:57.070]  The mainstream corporate media is in every major paper in the country, every so-called news channel, saying that President Trump wants violence against the media, that I want violence, that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks on the media, and they don't even show where I said it.
[01:01:57.991 --> 01:01:58.711]  This is grave.
[01:01:59.812 --> 01:02:06.136]  It means we could be hours, days, weeks away going into this election in, what, 82 days from now.
[01:02:08.339 --> 01:02:23.711]  To stage a huge event, just like evidence shows Bill Clinton and the Deep State did in 95, when they were way behind the polls, to blame the Midwest and the American people for Oklahoma City, to then get a sympathy vote for the Democrats and Bill Clinton.
[01:02:25.063 --> 01:02:30.047]  They are saying that imminent attacks are going to happen and the blood will be on President Trump's hands.
[01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.670]  They are now saying imminent attacks are coming and that it's going to be my fault.
[01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:34.831]  How obvious.
[01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:42.977]  The very same deep state where the Clintons in control of it has done this before and was able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in 1995.
[01:02:43.797 --> 01:02:47.000]  Bill Clinton told USA Today on Air Force One, pull it up.
[01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:54.766]  He said, I was able to win re-election and come from behind because of Oklahoma City.
[01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:59.103]  Now they're saying that I'm promoting a new Oklahoma City.
[01:02:59.163 --> 01:03:04.245]  Let me show you some of these incredible articles if you're a TV viewer.
[01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:05.986]  Look at this.
[01:03:06.186 --> 01:03:07.507]  CNN yesterday.
[01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:12.349]  Alex Jones complicit in domestic terror.
[01:03:12.849 --> 01:03:15.110]  Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist.
[01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.711]  No proof, no links, no nothing.
[01:03:19.472 --> 01:03:23.354]  Articles saying that I'm calling for assault weapon attacks.
[01:03:24.665 --> 01:03:25.847]  Nowhere is there a video.
[01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:29.931]  All they show is quotes around single or two words connected together.
[01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:35.258]  When Antifa said they were coming to attack members of Congress and their families, I said, you better get your battle rifles ready.
[01:03:35.518 --> 01:03:40.144]  They then show a quote and say, Antifa, mainstream media, chi-com operatives.
[01:03:41.665 --> 01:03:42.947]  We're going to play more of this later.
[01:03:42.967 --> 01:03:44.348]  The predictions get even more hardcore.
[01:03:44.368 --> 01:03:47.232]  But notice, first they say I'm a terrorist in CNN.
[01:03:47.372 --> 01:03:49.754]  Then they say I'm a terrorist in Wired Magazine.
[01:03:50.095 --> 01:03:53.819]  And now, mailed explosives, an act of terror, NYC mayor.
[01:03:54.179 --> 01:03:56.062]  It's hit all these leftists supposedly.
[01:03:57.472 --> 01:03:58.673]  I don't know if any of it's even true.
[01:03:58.693 --> 01:04:08.957]  These are all in blue areas where the police in New York, in Maryland, and other areas, I'm not saying they're all bad, have been caught working with Antifa to stage violent events and try to cause black riots.
[01:04:09.318 --> 01:04:11.459]  We got those documents in January of this year.
[01:04:11.939 --> 01:04:18.482]  Headline, document show, martial law plan that Obama had for Maryland.
[01:04:19.383 --> 01:04:22.544]  Documents show Obama Administration planning Marshall Lawn, Maryland.
[01:04:22.784 --> 01:04:26.246]  And it's all there, how key units of the police are Democratic operatives.
[01:04:26.766 --> 01:04:36.029]  And they're the types that will turn a blind eye when that truck bomb vaporizes a federal building or vaporizes a major news outlet.
[01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:37.850]  But I'll tell you this right now.
[01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:43.335]  Don't think they won't have pawn sacrifice and kill some of their own anchors and own operatives.
[01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:50.662]  Even if you're somebody like Wolf Blitzer, the globalist, will probably take out some of their own people to make it look real.
[01:04:51.242 --> 01:04:51.783]  Stay with us!
[01:04:51.903 --> 01:04:52.484]  Emergency!
[01:04:52.544 --> 01:04:53.024]  Emergency!
[01:04:53.064 --> 01:04:55.707]  The Republic is under attack from without and within!
[01:04:55.727 --> 01:04:57.248]  Decide which side you're on!
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.384]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[01:05:13.384 --> 01:05:20.249]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:20.509 --> 01:05:22.950]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:23.611 --> 01:05:24.471]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:28.834]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:28.874 --> 01:05:30.856]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:31.816 --> 01:05:32.757]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:33.697]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:34.277 --> 01:05:35.878]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:35.918 --> 01:05:38.879]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.241]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:43.922]  I will never falter.
[01:05:43.942 --> 01:05:46.543]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:47.544]  I physically will.
[01:05:47.984 --> 01:05:54.727]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:16.896]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:46.509]  I come to you, ladies and gentlemen, the most focused, the most concerned, the most crystal clear I've ever been in 23 and a half years on air.
[01:06:47.984 --> 01:06:57.608]  This is America and the entire free world in the Western world under mega-corporation attack, allied with Communist China and the unelected EU.
[01:06:58.408 --> 01:07:14.854]  Right now, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, brainwashed and prepared in leftist camps, are burning American flags and waving Mexican flags, and have gotten on giant 18-wheeler flatbacks to launch towards the border, you guessed it, arriving days before the election.
[01:07:16.479 --> 01:07:19.381]  And they are now being joined by other caravans of thousands and thousands.
[01:07:20.242 --> 01:07:23.524]  As I told you on Friday, it's not 200 that came across, it was 50,000.
[01:07:24.845 --> 01:07:27.748]  Now they say it was 14,000 yesterday, 20,000 today.
[01:07:28.268 --> 01:07:32.451]  No, it's 200,000 from the intel I've got, and I'll just leave it at that.
[01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:40.397]  The Mexican president said in July he was fomenting this with the UN and with the deep state and with Obama.
[01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:42.119]  He said it would bring down Trump.
[01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:43.600]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[01:07:44.926 --> 01:07:47.508]  That's why they want us off air, because we read what they say.
[01:07:47.728 --> 01:07:48.648]  They have to give orders.
[01:07:50.869 --> 01:07:59.274]  They'll lie in the mainstream media for the pop audience, but in their own corporate directives they say in the CFR, 20th century Chinese communist century.
[01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:00.875]  We're shutting America down by design.
[01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:02.997]  We're demoralizing the military.
[01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:04.978]  We're going to put, you know,
[01:08:06.553 --> 01:08:08.776]  Trannies in the military to destroy morale.
[01:08:09.116 --> 01:08:09.937]  It's a plan!
[01:08:10.177 --> 01:08:11.919]  They execute trannies in China.
[01:08:12.019 --> 01:08:13.161]  I say be nice to them.
[01:08:13.441 --> 01:08:17.285]  Just the point is, is that it's being done to shut the country down.
[01:08:17.646 --> 01:08:19.428]  We're under 21st century attack.
[01:08:19.688 --> 01:08:21.130]  You don't have nuclear wars now, folks.
[01:08:22.571 --> 01:08:41.923]  You have big megacorporations allied with nations infiltrating our open society doing this, and if our president says, we're a nation of laws, and we have a heritage binding us together in the great history of America, and we love to work with other nations, but we're not going to have 280% tariffs on us by China or by Canada, we're going to do what's good for us and have fair deals!
[01:08:42.123 --> 01:08:43.544]  We're going to stand up for ourselves!
[01:08:44.585 --> 01:08:48.067]  And they called that Nazi, and he said he's Hitler-like on every channel.
[01:08:49.602 --> 01:08:51.203]  The talking points go out and they happen.
[01:08:51.243 --> 01:08:52.685]  That's why Mike Adams and I knew this.
[01:08:52.725 --> 01:08:59.350]  Mike Adams is a best-selling author, has hundreds of top websites, bigger operations than I do, but he's been smart but under the radar.
[01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:01.292]  And now, obviously, he's not.
[01:09:01.312 --> 01:09:02.213]  They're trying to shut him down.
[01:09:03.233 --> 01:09:10.760]  And you have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that when, and he's an engineer as well, that when we see them come out,
[01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:34.612]  On every channel for six months and say Alex Jones is calling for killing the media, Alex Jones wants to bomb the media, Donald Trump wants to kill reporters, and every channel says Donald Trump and Alex Jones are going to get us killed when we're saying the opposite, and they're the ones calling for violence everywhere, that they have a history, they stand to gain, they have the motive, and they were clearly involved in Oklahoma City, the very same players.
[01:09:35.913 --> 01:09:39.395]  Obama sat at the knee of the Weather Underground.
[01:09:40.985 --> 01:09:45.690]  But instead of bombing things that you get to blame, bomb and blame somebody else, you see.
[01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:52.658]  So we're dealing literally with the equivalent of the weather underground here, in power, trying to stop Trump from getting the government back.
[01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:54.840]  So I said at the start of the show, an hour and ten minutes ago,
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.761]  Look for all the Democrats to get bonks.
[01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:00.281]  But it's funny, none of them are blowing up, nobody's getting hurt.
[01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:05.902]  They'll blow up a mail handler or something at the end of this in a few days, just to give it a little blood and make it look real.
[01:10:05.922 --> 01:10:07.643]  But notice, you know, they're mailing all these.
[01:10:07.663 --> 01:10:09.003]  It's incredibly obvious.
[01:10:09.243 --> 01:10:10.003]  It's a false flag.
[01:10:10.844 --> 01:10:11.704]  A trillion percent.
[01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:14.284]  There's no debating it, in my view.
[01:10:14.365 --> 01:10:15.645]  And I have that right to say it.
[01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:18.966]  And they have this idea that Alex Jones shouldn't question things.
[01:10:20.086 --> 01:10:20.226]  So.
[01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:30.962]  And now we have New York Times op-ed, George Soros' son blames Trump and demonization of opponents for bomb packages.
[01:10:31.242 --> 01:10:34.243]  I said an hour ago, wait for it, they'll build, they'll build, they'll build.
[01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:38.905]  And now they have Democrat New York City Communist mayor saying explosives are an act of terror.
[01:10:40.245 --> 01:10:42.746]  And now George Soros' son, Alexander Soros,
[01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:50.651]  The guy that helps overthrow Ukraine, the Arab Spring, all this crap, who has the left, who funds Antifa.
[01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:51.953]  This guy funds Antifa.
[01:10:53.335 --> 01:10:57.241]  He's over the foundation, whose name is on the papers, January of this year.
[01:10:58.783 --> 01:11:04.687]  Documents show Maryland, Obama planning to launch civil unrest to trigger martial law in Maryland.
[01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:06.268]  And whose name is on the papers?
[01:11:06.288 --> 01:11:07.188]  Guys, pull that up, please.
[01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.090]  Alexander Soros.
[01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:11.331]  Who do you think's funding me to be sued?
[01:11:11.591 --> 01:11:13.673]  Who do you think Goddessy platformed ahead of all this?
[01:11:13.993 --> 01:11:16.694]  Look at the psychotic look in his eye in every photo.
[01:11:16.915 --> 01:11:18.716]  He looks like a complete psychotic!
[01:11:21.274 --> 01:11:21.634]  There it is.
[01:11:21.654 --> 01:11:24.296]  Documents he'll plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[01:11:24.396 --> 01:11:27.818]  And they're losing in Europe and in Brazil and everywhere and they're scared.
[01:11:27.898 --> 01:11:33.582]  So, what did Bill Clinton say on Air Force One one month after being elected in 1996?
[01:11:33.842 --> 01:11:37.805]  He said, I owe my re-election.
[01:11:37.825 --> 01:11:42.868]  When I was 15 points behind at the Oklahoma City bombing, it gave us a lot of sympathy and galvanized people around us.
[01:11:44.264 --> 01:11:48.105]  So whereas I was sad to see it happen, I tell you I owe my re-election to it.
[01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:49.405]  And who'd he blame?
[01:11:49.865 --> 01:11:51.286]  Talk Radio and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:11:52.326 --> 01:11:54.427]  So joining us for the Balance of the Hour is Mike Adams.
[01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:57.827]  We'll play his predictions, his articles, his breakdown.
[01:11:58.168 --> 01:12:03.469]  Mike, this is so incredibly obvious and now when they catch the Patsy or the group...
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:10.902]  Magically, he's going to have Infowars paraphernalia, exactly as you predicted in dozens of reports.
[01:12:11.242 --> 01:12:13.343]  How unbelievably obvious is this?
[01:12:13.423 --> 01:12:24.348]  And that's why they pre-programmed, before they deplatformed me, that I was calling for violent mass shootings and bombings all over the news with no proof, so that people remember that when I get blamed.
[01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:25.789]  I think it's completely clear now, Mike.
[01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:28.031]  Well, it's a Democrat playbook.
[01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:30.373]  This is exactly what the globalists do.
[01:12:30.773 --> 01:12:33.596]  First, they demonize you, Alex, and then they censor you.
[01:12:33.636 --> 01:12:40.341]  They do a massive censorship purge, including purging on Twitter all the channels that would retweet your articles and your videos.
[01:12:40.722 --> 01:12:45.926]  And that way, they take away your right to defend yourself, your right to say that you're against violence.
[01:12:46.686 --> 01:12:51.589]  But then they set the narrative, and then they roll out the actual kinetic phase of the event.
[01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:53.451]  And that's what we're beginning to see now.
[01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:55.852]  These are test case pipe bombs.
[01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:59.995]  They're probably not active bombs yet, but that's where they're going.
[01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:00.975]  This is a test phase.
[01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:11.042]  But there's something, you know, in addition, Alex, the fact that you and I, on multiple occasions, I mean, dozens of times, publicly predicted exactly this rolling out.
[01:13:11.142 --> 01:13:12.003]  I mean, exactly.
[01:13:12.063 --> 01:13:13.944]  We said, I remember being in your studio saying,
[01:13:14.444 --> 01:13:16.746]  They would likely target CNN with bombs.
[01:13:16.966 --> 01:13:17.406]  Remember that?
[01:13:18.047 --> 01:13:19.368]  Or they would target Facebook.
[01:13:19.388 --> 01:13:23.471]  I remember we were talking about, would it be social media that they would target first?
[01:13:24.171 --> 01:13:27.253]  Or would it be CNN that the false flag would target?
[01:13:27.553 --> 01:13:29.515]  And we thought, you know, it's probably going to be CNN.
[01:13:30.501 --> 01:13:35.649]  Because that's what Trump, you know, Trump says CNN sucks, or the people at his rallies do.
[01:13:35.769 --> 01:13:44.662]  And so the media will now weave a narrative that says, well, Trump whipped this up, and Alex Jones whipped this up, and then they will use that to blame you.
[01:13:44.682 --> 01:13:45.703]  And I remember
[01:13:46.344 --> 01:14:09.996]  We specifically, on air, talked about how they would set up the mechanisms to blame you, Alex, where they would find a Patsy, they would have their browser history, their Google search history, it would be InfoWars, it would be Alex Jones videos in the history, whatever they need to create, it would all be set up, that person is out there right now, they have a Patsy, all ready, ready to go, ready to blame.
[01:14:10.596 --> 01:14:18.041]  So, as this goes into the full kinetic phase, they're going to roll out that Patsy, and they're going to link it to InfoWars.
[01:14:18.061 --> 01:14:19.041]  There's no question about it.
[01:14:19.401 --> 01:14:20.142]  It's a playbook.
[01:14:20.742 --> 01:14:23.444]  And it also, Alex, it shows the desperation.
[01:14:23.944 --> 01:14:36.012]  There's actually, the message here is that the Democrats now believe they will lose the midterms because this act of desperation shows that they think they need it to get them over the edge.
[01:14:36.092 --> 01:14:39.894]  They don't believe they will control the House of Representatives after this election.
[01:14:40.546 --> 01:14:48.572]  So what the American people need to do is reject this false flag attack, show, reveal it to be a false flag.
[01:14:48.892 --> 01:14:54.776]  And I'm already seeing user comments on articles at Zero Hedge and Mediaite and many other places.
[01:14:55.136 --> 01:14:57.998]  Just everyday users are saying, oh, this is a Democrat false flag.
[01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:58.779]  It's so obvious.
[01:14:59.179 --> 01:14:59.720]  They get it.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.100]  We warned about it.
[01:15:01.381 --> 01:15:02.221]  Everybody knows it.
[01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:04.743]  So just spread that information.
[01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:06.344]  Let's expose the truth about this.
[01:15:06.724 --> 01:15:10.207]  And let's save America from this multi-planet invasion that's happening.
[01:15:10.467 --> 01:15:12.148]  And I want to just thank you for your clarity.
[01:15:12.168 --> 01:15:13.788]  You've been crystal clear on everything, Mike.
[01:15:14.369 --> 01:15:15.749]  And thank God you're there.
[01:15:15.789 --> 01:15:20.511]  It makes me sleep better at night, because I'm telling you, I've got courage to fight these people, because I know how bad they are.
[01:15:20.551 --> 01:15:25.413]  But man, when you actually get singled out to be destroyed, you get guilty.
[01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:26.553]  You think, God, what about my children?
[01:15:26.573 --> 01:15:29.194]  But then I realize they have no future anyways if we don't beat these people.
[01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:38.018]  And I cannot impress on the listeners of radio and TV out there and on the internet, you've got to get Mike Adams' articles at falseflagnews.com.
[01:15:38.758 --> 01:15:40.258]  Uh, we'll give a URL.
[01:15:40.278 --> 01:15:41.459]  FalseFlag.News.
[01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:42.399]  FalseFlag.News.
[01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:50.101]  You've got to get the articles out from InfoWars.com that are going up, and you've got to get the live feed out and say, listen, they're getting ready to frame everybody for this.
[01:15:50.961 --> 01:15:52.361]  They censored Alex ahead of hand.
[01:15:52.802 --> 01:15:55.102]  This is what you got to see and share this link.
[01:15:55.402 --> 01:15:56.202]  Pay it forward.
[01:15:56.482 --> 01:15:58.023]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:16:05.726 --> 01:16:09.809]  I personally buy high-quality, storable food every decade or so.
[01:16:09.849 --> 01:16:18.815]  And even though the best quality food that we sell at InfoWareStore.com lasts more than 25 years, every 10 years or so, I give it away to the homeless and know that they're getting high-quality food.
[01:16:20.145 --> 01:16:25.209]  But the reason I do that is because I know we could have a nuclear war, we could have an asteroid hit, an earthquake.
[01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:31.775]  It's normal for everything above grasshoppers, ants up to humans, to take care of yourself, to not count on FEMA.
[01:16:32.275 --> 01:16:43.705]  President Trump's great, but you see things like Hurricane Michael devastating the coastline, like a nuclear bomb went off and you learn the government takes weeks or months, or in the case of Puerto Rico, over a year to get all the power back on.
[01:16:44.872 --> 01:16:46.073]  And that's because they're not God.
[01:16:46.373 --> 01:16:47.374]  They can't fix everything.
[01:16:47.734 --> 01:16:49.716]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:16:50.116 --> 01:16:54.780]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they can't food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:16:56.121 --> 01:16:58.763]  And that's what I'm talking about at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:16:59.064 --> 01:17:05.989]  With Mfulworth Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply, one of the top, most respected companies out there.
[01:17:06.069 --> 01:17:13.516]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:17:14.645 --> 01:17:16.086]  There's been some big fights over this.
[01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:27.912]  In fact, it's been a couple years since I was able to actually offer you 35% off the already discounted price we have, where there's even very little profit in for us or for my Patriot.
[01:17:27.932 --> 01:17:32.775]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:17:33.295 --> 01:17:35.196]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:17:35.556 --> 01:17:38.678]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:17:39.358 --> 01:17:40.799]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:45.280]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.521]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:17:48.102 --> 01:17:50.583]  Bottom line, you support the M4 with the products.
[01:17:50.943 --> 01:17:51.743]  You put it in your attic.
[01:17:51.763 --> 01:17:52.703]  You put it in your garage.
[01:17:53.064 --> 01:17:54.344]  You take it with you when you go camping.
[01:17:54.384 --> 01:18:05.128]  But you always know if something bad happens, a hurricane, an earthquake, a tornado, whatever the case is, or maybe you lose your job, God forbid, you've got that three-month, that six-month, that year supply.
[01:18:05.369 --> 01:18:06.549]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:18:06.929 --> 01:18:08.450]  If stuff happens, you could feed your whole block.
[01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:18.795]  We've also got great air filtration and water filtration produced by the very same people, Alexa Pure Breeze and Alexa Pure Water Filtration are the same folks that bring you My Patriot Supply.
[01:18:19.135 --> 01:18:26.279]  They only started about 10 years ago, but within a few years, they were one of the dominant companies, the top three, because of quality and great service and low prices.
[01:18:26.899 --> 01:18:29.041]  InfoWarsTore.com has their full spectrum.
[01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:33.023]  The lowest price, you'll find it anywhere under the name InfoWars Select.
[01:18:33.523 --> 01:18:35.864]  We also have the full Patriot Supply catalog there as well.
[01:18:35.884 --> 01:18:36.865]  But whatever you do,
[01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:58.140]  Realize that almost metaphysically, well not even almost, when we become self-sufficient at carpentry, or at farming, or at marksmanship, or at hand-to-hand combat, or communication, or at web mastering, whatever it is, or being an electrician, a blacksmith, a gunsmith, when we learn these tools it activates parts of our minds, it empowers us.
[01:18:58.541 --> 01:19:02.304]  And when you have the self-defense implements, the water filtration,
[01:19:03.084 --> 01:19:08.049]  The air filtration, the food, it is something you're meant to do in the hierarchy of needs.
[01:19:08.329 --> 01:19:09.150]  It's very empowering.
[01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:21.541]  So, supply yourself with your survival needs as just an insurance backup, insurance you can eat, at InfoWorksTour.com today and know that the money that comes in allows us to continue our fight
[01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:27.027]  To restore the Republic and empower free market systems and defend Christianity and so much more.
[01:19:27.707 --> 01:19:32.412]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:34.874]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars Select.
[01:19:35.174 --> 01:19:38.037]  High quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:20:03.129 --> 01:20:05.750]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:29.378 --> 01:20:33.403]  Alex Jones here with Mike Adams of nationalnews.com back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:45.248]  Next hour we have a six minute video compilation that's got the latest clips in it of the Democrats demonizing Trump for being a nationalist and saying it's racist and Hitler.
[01:20:45.268 --> 01:20:49.771]  And we have another compilation of them calling for violence against President Trump.
[01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:51.432]  We're going to air in the next hour.
[01:20:52.233 --> 01:20:56.756]  And violence against conservatives and Alex Soros funding violent anti-vote.
[01:20:56.776 --> 01:20:57.877]  You see the full page ads?
[01:20:58.157 --> 01:20:58.818]  The New York Times?
[01:20:58.898 --> 01:21:00.479]  That's the group he funds publicly.
[01:21:01.658 --> 01:21:06.181]  And now he says the conservatives tried to bomb him and it's Trump's fault.
[01:21:07.682 --> 01:21:11.924]  Boy, almost like he knows that they're gonna find a patsy.
[01:21:12.805 --> 01:21:13.646]  Isn't that magical?
[01:21:14.306 --> 01:21:18.509]  That's from the same show where Mike Adams on August 16th asked me, are you a terrorist?
[01:21:18.529 --> 01:21:19.309]  Do you want to be violent?
[01:21:19.329 --> 01:21:20.330]  We're gonna play that next segment.
[01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:26.434]  We're gonna go back to Mike right now, but here's a clip on August 16th where I lay it all out and this is where we are now.
[01:21:26.814 --> 01:21:28.075]  Again, they think you're so stupid
[01:21:28.837 --> 01:21:33.401]  They pre-programmed the narrative so that people accept it when it happens.
[01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:33.821]  Here it is.
[01:21:34.742 --> 01:21:41.287]  Because they've got armies of people battle-testing how to censor right now when they blow up their own news organizations.
[01:21:41.608 --> 01:21:42.949]  The newspapers are already bankrupt.
[01:21:42.989 --> 01:21:43.829]  It's all sinking.
[01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:45.251]  The corporate media is dead.
[01:21:45.471 --> 01:21:46.371]  The Democrats are dead.
[01:21:46.712 --> 01:21:52.737]  All they can do, like a bar that's out of business in Goodfellas and been bankrupt, is burn it down for the insurance money.
[01:21:53.337 --> 01:21:56.059]  The Democrats and the globalists are getting ready to burn down
[01:21:57.057 --> 01:21:58.399]  A tech company.
[01:21:58.879 --> 01:22:00.601]  They're getting ready to burn down the stock market.
[01:22:00.621 --> 01:22:01.322]  They've said they will.
[01:22:01.342 --> 01:22:02.604]  They're already trying to crash the economy.
[01:22:02.644 --> 01:22:03.084]  Bill Maher.
[01:22:03.425 --> 01:22:17.081]  They're getting ready to physically shoot up some of their facilities after saying I'm calling for it with no proof as to be the wall of indignation and anger to steal the election in November and then have the cover story for it.
[01:22:19.389 --> 01:22:20.650]  And there's hours of these.
[01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:24.114]  I mean, Mike Adams did an hour and a half emergency report showing all the proof.
[01:22:24.414 --> 01:22:25.716]  Histories of false flags.
[01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:27.598]  Democrats caught doing it.
[01:22:28.279 --> 01:22:30.141]  Mike, I cannot express on listeners.
[01:22:31.002 --> 01:22:31.842]  Thirteen days out.
[01:22:33.024 --> 01:22:38.905]  Radio stations, however you're listening, everyone must hit their whole email list with InfoWars.com for its live show.
[01:22:39.385 --> 01:22:40.886]  They must go to InfoWars.com.
[01:22:40.906 --> 01:22:45.527]  They must get the archive of this live show once it's posted in a few hours and send it to everyone.
[01:22:45.787 --> 01:22:48.867]  Help stop the deep state false flag that's meant to throw the election.
[01:22:49.107 --> 01:22:49.687]  We know it.
[01:22:49.767 --> 01:22:57.969]  It's so obvious when you know the history, you know who the players are, you see the pre-programming, and now it's happening as an exact script.
[01:22:58.169 --> 01:23:01.350]  And I agree with you though, this is extreme desperation.
[01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:02.390]  Mike, you're a smart cookie.
[01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:12.404]  What do you think, and what are the former intelligence folks that I know you work closely with, what are they thinking right now?
[01:23:12.424 --> 01:23:13.025]  What are they saying?
[01:23:14.484 --> 01:23:18.746]  My greatest concern right now, this caravan that's headed for the U.S.
[01:23:18.806 --> 01:23:22.347]  border, I've wondered from day one, what's the point of this caravan?
[01:23:22.727 --> 01:23:32.711]  Are the Democrats so stupid that they think that having hordes of people at the gates, at the border of America, would somehow help them win elections?
[01:23:33.071 --> 01:23:35.071]  Because I think the American people reject that.
[01:23:35.091 --> 01:23:36.612]  The American people want to protect their border.
[01:23:36.992 --> 01:23:39.473]  So it occurred to me this morning,
[01:23:40.504 --> 01:23:44.849]  That their plan may be, and again, I pray for these people.
[01:23:44.889 --> 01:23:45.890]  I pray for their safety.
[01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:48.552]  I don't want to see any kind of violence happen against these people.
[01:23:48.572 --> 01:23:54.158]  Well, you texted me two days ago and you said you were going to pull a false flag on the caravan and kill a bunch of them and blame us.
[01:23:55.039 --> 01:23:55.860]  That's exactly right.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.441]  It was just reinforced this morning.
[01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:03.748]  But I think that if they bomb, if the globalists, the same people who are sending these bombs to CNN, if they bomb the caravan,
[01:24:04.108 --> 01:24:11.132]  Or if they shoot up the caravan, then, and they have CNN cameras there, just like they had a CNN camera in that elevator with Jeff Flake.
[01:24:11.712 --> 01:24:13.613]  They will have the cameras there, they'll have the blood.
[01:24:13.653 --> 01:24:20.016]  Remember, every false flag, to sway the political future of America... Boise Fort was a false flag!
[01:24:21.107 --> 01:24:22.748]  They need blood on camera.
[01:24:22.988 --> 01:24:23.749]  I mean, let's be honest.
[01:24:23.789 --> 01:24:24.810]  That's what they look for.
[01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:25.650]  That's what they plan.
[01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.191]  And this is how they could pull it off.
[01:24:27.552 --> 01:24:32.775]  And it saddens me so much to even have to bring up that this could be a possibility.
[01:24:33.156 --> 01:24:36.298]  You know, Alex, I mean, the whole reason why you and I warn people
[01:24:36.958 --> 01:24:42.041]  It's not to get people afraid, but rather to prevent these kinds of attacks.
[01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:45.163]  We do want to get them afraid of letting the globalists pull this off.
[01:24:45.283 --> 01:24:46.743]  That's what the big fear is, letting them win.
[01:24:47.004 --> 01:24:48.184]  Not trying to scare you with this.
[01:24:48.524 --> 01:24:50.165]  Ladies and gentlemen, they funded the Arab Spring.
[01:24:50.205 --> 01:24:51.246]  They funded everything.
[01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:52.867]  These globalists are cold-blooded.
[01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.848]  They've been losing at every level, and they're desperate.
[01:24:55.108 --> 01:24:58.970]  And how obvious does it have to get when it's coming out that Soros is funding the caravan?
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:24:59.550]  It's in the news.
[01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:04.433]  It's coming out, he's funding, and then now he gets mailed a bomb, and his son is blaming Trump.
[01:25:05.336 --> 01:25:09.599]  They could be directing this caravan into a kill zone.
[01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:21.026]  And the kill zone could be, it could be them being shot from helicopters in a nighttime helicopter raid that you can't get any, nobody has any video footage so they just blame it on America.
[01:25:21.466 --> 01:25:25.108]  Or it could be a globalist that plant a bomb inside the caravan.
[01:25:25.148 --> 01:25:26.429]  Who knows what it could be?
[01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:29.351]  But I think they're paying these people and leading them into a trap
[01:25:29.731 --> 01:25:31.974]  So they can steal the midterm elections.
[01:25:32.334 --> 01:25:34.076]  They don't care how many people they kill.
[01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:34.937]  This is the sad thing.
[01:25:35.237 --> 01:25:37.780]  These globalists, they so desperately seek power.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.162]  They will commit violence.
[01:25:39.182 --> 01:25:40.303]  They will commit terrorism.
[01:25:40.763 --> 01:25:41.804]  They will blame innocent people.
[01:25:41.824 --> 01:25:43.246]  They will murder innocent people.
[01:25:43.546 --> 01:25:45.869]  We've seen this throughout American history.
[01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:47.711]  How desperate they are for power.
[01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:48.432]  They'll do anything.
[01:25:48.952 --> 01:26:06.348]  And so we must spread the alarm, because the bigger pushback that we have, the more people stand up and say, we know this is a false flag, then the greater the safety of all those people will be, because maybe the globalists will back off if they think it won't work.
[01:26:06.648 --> 01:26:11.112]  So our voices right now can help save lives against these false flag terrorists.
[01:26:11.372 --> 01:26:11.913]  Think about that.
[01:26:12.952 --> 01:26:13.592]  No, I agree.
[01:26:13.653 --> 01:26:19.997]  In fact, when I update and take videos from this live feed and post them to InfoWars.com, I'm going to put that clip of what you just said up front.
[01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:21.178]  We can stop it.
[01:26:21.258 --> 01:26:30.624]  But look, when the show started this morning, about 10 minutes in, I said, the Clintons, Soros, it goes the hierarchy, Soros, the Clintons,
[01:26:31.805 --> 01:26:39.311]  Then it goes to Obama, then it goes to the former Attorney General, then it goes to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then it goes on down.
[01:26:39.411 --> 01:26:42.093]  Chris Cuomo supposedly sent a bomb.
[01:26:42.413 --> 01:26:49.378]  And so all the little darlings who've been under attack, Cuomo saying America was never that great, America isn't great, it's not going to be great.
[01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:53.341]  All this anti-American crap showing they're globalists, showing they're not Americans.
[01:26:53.681 --> 01:26:54.502]  They hate Americans.
[01:26:55.303 --> 01:27:00.908]  All of the people that are on the ropes are getting the bombs in the mail so they can be the victims.
[01:27:01.128 --> 01:27:03.610]  And what does Soros' son, who now runs his empire, say?
[01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:08.415]  He says, your rhetoric, Trump, hurt me!
[01:27:08.835 --> 01:27:09.175]  Stop!
[01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:10.236]  Your speech is bad!
[01:27:10.296 --> 01:27:11.157]  You're hurting me!
[01:27:11.497 --> 01:27:13.179]  When he funds anti for that little monster,
[01:27:14.534 --> 01:27:17.397]  Well, the Democrats are, of course, experts in victimhood.
[01:27:17.737 --> 01:27:24.344]  This is what they teach young students in college today, how to be a victim rather than how to be someone who contributes to society.
[01:27:25.304 --> 01:27:27.707]  How to think like a victim instead of thinking like a winner.
[01:27:28.454 --> 01:27:33.118]  And this is why they hate Trump so much, because Trump is a winner and his policies are winning policies.
[01:27:33.158 --> 01:27:35.099]  And he's helping America win again.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.821]  The Democrats want to tear down America.
[01:27:38.082 --> 01:27:39.643]  They want to destroy the economy.
[01:27:39.663 --> 01:27:41.384]  They want to destroy the free market system.
[01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:44.226]  They want to release prisoners and shut down the prisons.
[01:27:45.127 --> 01:27:48.109]  Destroy any border protection and just literally invade the country.
[01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:48.750]  You know all this.
[01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:55.355]  But the thing is, they are willing to bomb and murder and maim people in order to accomplish their political goals.
[01:27:55.415 --> 01:27:57.897]  It's the very definition of domestic terrorism.
[01:27:58.417 --> 01:27:59.499]  And we see it clearly.
[01:27:59.579 --> 01:28:01.081]  We've seen it for months.
[01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:02.983]  I mean, maybe more than a year, we've seen it.
[01:28:03.284 --> 01:28:06.408]  And I think more and more of the American people see it as well.
[01:28:06.788 --> 01:28:12.215]  And I think that right now, this early voting surge that we are seeing across America is being reported everywhere.
[01:28:12.736 --> 01:28:16.080]  The early voting surge, I think, is more of a red wave surge.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.101]  Oh, by the way, they've got major studies out that I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:28:19.121 --> 01:28:19.901]  We'll talk about that.
[01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:22.842]  Saying it is massively Republican.
[01:28:22.902 --> 01:28:24.982]  The biggest Republican turnout in the midterm they've ever seen.
[01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:27.803]  And that's why the left is now hitting the panic button with this.
[01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:28.423]  U.S.
[01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:32.364]  Army vet lawyer Kurt Schlittler says mail bombs could be a leftist scam.
[01:28:32.504 --> 01:28:35.585]  Ben Shapiro says anyone suggesting a false flag is deranged.
[01:28:35.845 --> 01:28:43.068]  You know, it's always funny that I see Ben Shapiro's stuff by Google, Facebook, Twitter, force-fed in everyone's feeds, everywhere.
[01:28:43.288 --> 01:28:44.589]  Just, he's pushed, he's pushed.
[01:28:44.829 --> 01:28:46.950]  He's the anointed one, the never-Trumper.
[01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:55.854]  And now that Trump's being blamed by Soros' evil son, and we're all about to be blamed, mark my words, don't worry, we just have to take the blame!
[01:28:56.834 --> 01:28:58.195]  Ben Shapiro's a snake!
[01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:07.834]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[01:29:08.114 --> 01:29:10.435]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.
[01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:16.397]  Well, actually maybe Hillary and George Soros don't, but everybody else has a heart and this product is amazing.
[01:29:16.497 --> 01:29:17.578]  So, if you have a heart,

[01:29:56.951 --> 01:29:59.273]  Now available at m4warslife.com.
[01:30:01.074 --> 01:30:01.654]  Good morning.
[01:30:01.774 --> 01:30:03.675]  Sorry, I must have missed my invitation to mail.
[01:30:03.695 --> 01:30:04.695]  My name is Faith Mould.
[01:30:04.755 --> 01:30:05.156]  Hello!
[01:30:10.272 --> 01:30:14.414]  Let Faith Speak!
[01:30:14.894 --> 01:30:20.558]  Let Faith Speak!
[01:30:21.138 --> 01:30:22.259]  Let Faith Speak!
[01:30:22.819 --> 01:30:23.980]  Let Faith Speak!
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:24.820]  Thank you.
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:25.981]  I'm so sorry.
[01:30:26.061 --> 01:30:29.543]  We cannot allow you to judge us.
[01:30:39.896 --> 01:30:45.740]  Let Faith speak!
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.844]  Let Faith speak!
[01:30:51.904 --> 01:30:54.106]  Communists!
[01:30:54.146 --> 01:30:54.366]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:54.386 --> 01:30:55.166]  We support the police.
[01:30:55.206 --> 01:30:56.267]  We love our officers.
[01:30:56.567 --> 01:30:58.449]  But the only ones out here are actually talking about you guys.
[01:30:58.809 --> 01:31:02.672]  These guys are on T. Forbes here, not letting me over to the main stage.
[01:31:02.692 --> 01:31:05.954]  Yeah, I know, and that's why I was presenting a petition with 5,000 signatures, sir.
[01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:10.990]  So, Faith Goldie is really in third place out of 30 plus people.
[01:31:11.131 --> 01:31:13.414]  That's amazing, and they won't let her come to the debates.
[01:31:13.654 --> 01:31:17.219]  So, she's engaged in real information guerrilla warfare.
[01:31:17.419 --> 01:31:21.164]  FaithForToronto.ca, she's on Twitter, at Faith Goldie.
[01:31:21.344 --> 01:31:22.426]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:31:22.586 --> 01:31:29.111]  It's a real honor, and I appreciate you helping to spread our message of how much democracy is under siege.
[01:31:29.171 --> 01:31:39.098]  So I'm running for mayor, and Alex, I have to say, there are actually more than 30 candidates, and I have been polling in the top three since the day I announced my bid to become mayor.
[01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:45.002]  In fact, my polling numbers are higher than all 32 people underneath me combined.
[01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:55.112]  And yet these folks, these opinion makers and gatekeepers, rather, of the status quo are inviting everyone onto their stage except for me.
[01:31:55.392 --> 01:32:03.320]  What we have to do is just to continue to frankly seek truth and also don't be afraid to sometimes let out what you think.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:07.644]  Every single person I've talked to on this campaign, Alex, says, I'm voting for you.
[01:32:07.984 --> 01:32:09.746]  And everyone I talk to is voting for you.
[01:32:10.127 --> 01:32:14.392]  Don't be afraid to show it from the rooftops.
[01:32:14.412 --> 01:32:17.656]  One of the things that I hear from all of my volunteers is faith.
[01:32:18.097 --> 01:32:20.360]  Your fearlessness is contagious.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.262]  Folks have to remember that.
[01:32:22.282 --> 01:32:26.587]  We can all be leaders in our own lives, whether it be around the water cooler.
[01:32:27.188 --> 01:32:29.691]  Our dinner tables and our university classrooms.
[01:32:30.071 --> 01:32:32.594]  Having a brass pair is contagious.
[01:32:32.774 --> 01:32:36.958]  Everything they're doing is to try to stop something like you because you're everything they wish they had.
[01:32:37.439 --> 01:32:40.462]  And that's happening to all conservatives, all nationalists, all over the world.
[01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:46.748]  Twitter, Facebook, Google, as you know, are concertedly trying to stop populist nationalist movements everywhere.
[01:32:46.768 --> 01:32:47.829]  And I have just read
[01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:53.672]  The local paper, uh, you know, saying that you were polling number three out of the six major candidates.
[01:32:53.773 --> 01:32:56.674]  I had no idea that there were 30 plus total.
[01:32:56.954 --> 01:32:57.814]  That is amazing.
[01:33:04.158 --> 01:33:06.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.318 --> 01:33:29.078]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:31.079]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:31.499 --> 01:33:32.299]  Or your mind.
[01:33:32.359 --> 01:33:35.780]  Alright, Mike Adams who joins us right now live on October 11th.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.161]  Talking to us a few weeks ago.
[01:33:40.882 --> 01:33:44.903]  Made another one of his urgent, not predictions, but analysis.
[01:33:44.963 --> 01:33:52.285]  If you're driving along the mountains, you see a turn in the road, and you look off and it's blue sky going down for 10,000 feet.
[01:33:52.305 --> 01:33:53.645]  You know if you drive off, you're dead.
[01:33:55.106 --> 01:33:56.566]  So, if I sit here,
[01:33:58.095 --> 01:34:11.144]  And I make a prediction that if I take this bottle of Claritin that somebody left sitting in here, and if I throw it, it's gonna fly across the room.
[01:34:13.506 --> 01:34:16.228]  Or if I pick this phone up and I call my wife, she's gonna answer.
[01:34:16.628 --> 01:34:17.669]  That's not a prediction.
[01:34:18.449 --> 01:34:19.390]  That's a probability.
[01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:23.092]  And that's a 2 plus 2 train of thought.
[01:34:23.152 --> 01:34:23.713]  It's logical.
[01:34:24.707 --> 01:34:41.463]  They have been in a complete insane asylum, chickens with their heads cut off, running around in the controlled corporate media and the universities saying Trump and Alex Jones and Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson are all Nazis.
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:53.171]  And the free press is evil, and we gotta shut down DrugsReport.com, and we gotta shut Alex Jones down, and Alex Jones says, bomb and use machine guns to kill the media.
[01:34:53.352 --> 01:34:54.513]  No video, no clips.
[01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:55.774]  And I'll keep repeating that.
[01:34:57.637 --> 01:35:03.924]  When someone runs around and points at your house and says, that house is gonna burn down next Tuesday,
[01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:06.707]  You go, why?
[01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:08.589]  Well, I'm not going to tell you, but I think it is.
[01:35:09.369 --> 01:35:12.952]  And then your house burns down next Tuesday when you're out of town.
[01:35:12.992 --> 01:35:18.057]  You go, you walk over to Bob's house, you go, hey, Bob, why'd you say that?
[01:35:18.077 --> 01:35:19.678]  Because right now you're the prime suspect.
[01:35:20.939 --> 01:35:21.860]  Or did somebody tell you that?
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.302]  I mean, this is not even two plus two equals four.
[01:35:24.963 --> 01:35:27.765]  This is just looking at the number one and saying, is that number one?
[01:35:29.146 --> 01:35:30.047]  Or a big green light.
[01:35:31.755 --> 01:35:33.976]  Because they're the ones calling for violence.
[01:35:34.016 --> 01:35:36.676]  They're the ones saying you can't say nationalism or mother and father.
[01:35:36.916 --> 01:35:44.118]  They're the ones gaslighting the whole country to tell us we're bad and demoralize us and try to start race wars and tell people to just randomly kill cops.
[01:35:44.858 --> 01:35:47.259]  They tried to have the UN federalize the police three years ago.
[01:35:48.019 --> 01:35:52.500]  Obama put stay-behind networks in the government that are ignoring what Trump says and are doing whatever they want.
[01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:58.362]  They've got Phil Mudd and all of them on TV saying kill the president.
[01:35:58.382 --> 01:35:59.482]  We're going to kill the president.
[01:36:01.069 --> 01:36:08.332]  The MSNBC host saying 25th Amendment, CNBC, CNN, ABC, use the US military to attack the White House!
[01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:10.933]  Rosie O'Donnell!
[01:36:12.073 --> 01:36:14.234]  You've got all the Democrats saying, plunge the stock market!
[01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:15.635]  The Chinese Communists are trying!
[01:36:17.496 --> 01:36:18.816]  We've got treason here!
[01:36:20.117 --> 01:36:21.217]  And they say they hate America!
[01:36:21.377 --> 01:36:23.058]  And they say if you love America, you're the bad guy!
[01:36:23.238 --> 01:36:27.240]  They're in our country, they work for foreign powers, they're trying to demoralize us!
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.521]  They're telling us we have no speech.
[01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:36.627]  They're censoring everybody ahead of the midterms and the giant migrant invasion force.
[01:36:36.647 --> 01:36:46.915]  The illegal alien UN-run force that have all been brainwashed in the camps to burn American flags and wave their foreign flags and have the left saying if you stop any of them you're horrible and you're hurting children.
[01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:48.116]  And no ICE.
[01:36:49.317 --> 01:36:49.817]  No ICE.
[01:36:51.318 --> 01:36:51.859]  No wall.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.361]  No USA at all.
[01:36:55.305 --> 01:36:55.785]  No ice.
[01:36:56.125 --> 01:36:56.645]  No wall.
[01:36:56.906 --> 01:37:01.867]  And now you've got all the Hollywood people, all the news, coming out and saying, how dare you even have borders?
[01:37:01.887 --> 01:37:03.288]  Of course, they've got big walls at their houses.
[01:37:03.608 --> 01:37:04.728]  This is insane!
[01:37:05.248 --> 01:37:06.569]  Leftist brainwashed groups.
[01:37:06.609 --> 01:37:07.509]  Going back to Mike Adams.
[01:37:07.529 --> 01:37:08.649]  I want to play this clip.
[01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:11.430]  Next hour, after he's gone, I'm going to play a bunch of his clips.
[01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:12.651]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:37:13.871 --> 01:37:17.933]  And I'm an host of the 4th Hour, signed with Matt Bracken, who's a perfect guest today to break this down.
[01:37:17.953 --> 01:37:20.475]  Former Navy SEAL, has been predicting the false flag.
[01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:23.837]  They caught this leftist a month ago with a 200-pound bomb.
[01:37:23.877 --> 01:37:26.738]  He admits he was going to blow up on Election Day to cancel the election.
[01:37:26.798 --> 01:37:28.339]  And what Mike Adams said earlier is key.
[01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:30.561]  We're going to cover it, not this segment, but next.
[01:37:30.681 --> 01:37:31.321]  I want to build it up.
[01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:33.922]  New article just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:36.224]  It's got links to all the major survey groups.
[01:37:37.975 --> 01:37:41.399]  Early voting results indicate Republican turnout crushing blue wave.
[01:37:41.739 --> 01:37:44.182]  Confirmed to be the biggest ever in a midterm.
[01:37:44.822 --> 01:37:49.688]  That's why the left gauged it and said, oh my god, we've got to make our move.
[01:37:50.646 --> 01:37:53.889]  The next 13 days are the most important so far in our country's history.
[01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:56.512]  This is beyond Lexington and Concord at this point.
[01:37:56.812 --> 01:37:57.913]  This is beyond Gettysburg.
[01:37:58.033 --> 01:37:58.674]  This is it.
[01:37:59.234 --> 01:38:14.990]  We have an open enemy that hates America, that hates our families, that hates our president, that says you can't even say we're a country, that are sworn to destroy us, and that have built up that we're violent, that we're going to stage violence, and now all the Democrats are getting mailed pipe bombs, and they're already blaming Trump and America?
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.601]  And George Soros is the first one to get mailed it?
[01:38:18.982 --> 01:38:20.403]  That's a message to all of us!
[01:38:21.904 --> 01:38:22.844]  They think we're idiots!
[01:38:24.605 --> 01:38:26.667]  The only way they can win is with a false flag!
[01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:27.868]  It's all they've got!
[01:38:28.508 --> 01:38:31.350]  Here is Mike Adams predicting this two weeks ago.
[01:38:32.367 --> 01:38:42.911]  I agree with your assessment that they are setting up you in particular to be the fall guy for whatever false flag event that they engineer and carry out.
[01:38:42.971 --> 01:38:49.654]  And let us not forget, by the way, that the FBI itself was exposed by the New York Times several years ago.
[01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:58.476]  For plotting and carrying out terrorist activities where they would recruit sometimes homeless people off the street or drug addicts off the street.
[01:38:58.737 --> 01:39:04.758]  They would recruit them say here drive this van you know and and and the FBI would have a terror plot all planned out.
[01:39:05.098 --> 01:39:06.959]  They would use you know mock explosives.
[01:39:07.479 --> 01:39:12.881]  They wouldn't actually let it go through but they would plan and carry out these attacks with the help of some you know some
[01:39:15.177 --> 01:39:17.017]  Mark that they would find off the street, whatever.
[01:39:17.037 --> 01:39:23.159]  So the FBI has a lot of experience actually plotting terrorist activities domestically in the United States.
[01:39:23.699 --> 01:39:29.420]  Now, not everybody in the FBI is bad, of course, but the leadership was evil under Jones.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.640]  Oh, there's major leftist stay-behind networks.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:38.422]  And again, every protester caught taking over the Kavanaugh hearings got caught outside being paid off cash by a Soros lawyer.
[01:39:39.002 --> 01:39:44.987]  So exactly, they just go one level further, where the New York Times goes, oh, here's where the Freedom Caucus plays baseball.
[01:39:45.487 --> 01:39:46.788]  They don't have any security.
[01:39:46.808 --> 01:39:52.653]  And then literally, they sent a Dennis Hastert acolyte out there and CNN said he was a hero.
[01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:55.095]  So these people are sick.
[01:39:56.465 --> 01:40:08.948]  And the point is that they can stage an event and then they can, by silencing you in advance, you won't be able to defend yourself against the false narrative that will be rolled out as a false narrative has been rolled out.
[01:40:08.968 --> 01:40:16.691]  Oh, I was about to say, did you see the nationwide deal that Facebook force-fed to all their people as they took me off saying, Jones bullied poor Native Americans.
[01:40:16.991 --> 01:40:24.873]  There's these pig-like racist ladies saying whites are subhuman, we're monkeys, my parents are brother and sister.
[01:40:25.493 --> 01:40:27.958]  And then they edit that out and have me yelling back at them.
[01:40:28.039 --> 01:40:30.904]  Imagine the criminal activity of Facebook.
[01:40:31.886 --> 01:40:32.347]  Right, right.
[01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:36.376]  And don't forget that the New York Times, of course, hired Sarah Zhang.
[01:40:37.085 --> 01:40:41.267]  Who has tweets out there that are racist against white people.
[01:40:41.687 --> 01:40:45.689]  They're destroying... Whites grow up in goblin holes in the ground.
[01:40:45.729 --> 01:40:46.489]  They're subhuman.
[01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:47.269]  Exterminate them.
[01:40:47.509 --> 01:40:48.710]  It's like, yes!
[01:40:48.970 --> 01:40:49.690]  Yes!
[01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:56.913]  So the censorship of you, of course, is selective application of their rules that they really can't even define.
[01:40:56.953 --> 01:41:01.435]  Basically, it all comes down to they don't like Alex Jones and they want to cut you off.
[01:41:02.862 --> 01:41:12.047]  I think it's where they blame you for what's coming, and then they want to use that to cement the silencing of conservative and pro-American voices all across the country.
[01:41:12.348 --> 01:41:14.649]  Oh, I totally agree, because I'm not that important.
[01:41:14.949 --> 01:41:24.695]  They picked me to build me up to be destroyed because they knew we were a populist movement, and then once people don't stand up for me when it happens, then everyone loses everything.
[01:41:25.743 --> 01:41:26.244]  That's right.
[01:41:26.685 --> 01:41:34.236]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and shut up for a couple of segments and let Mike Adams give his future predictions and ideas of what we need to do and how we need to stop this.
[01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:38.642]  I'm going to behave myself for two more segments and then I'm going to get to a bunch of the clips and your calls.
[01:41:39.103 --> 01:41:40.505]  But everyone must get the article.
[01:41:41.286 --> 01:41:42.607]  From naturalnews.com.
[01:41:43.087 --> 01:41:45.288]  I can't tweet this out, only you can tweet this out.
[01:41:46.349 --> 01:41:49.451]  We'll repost it at newswars.com.
[01:41:49.891 --> 01:41:50.792]  Emergency alert!
[01:41:50.892 --> 01:41:54.434]  Trump has only one path to save America from a deep state takeover.
[01:41:54.954 --> 01:41:56.435]  And Mike predicted it all.
[01:41:56.815 --> 01:42:02.939]  That he has to declare a civil emergency because they're going to assail the borders, they're going to stage the bombing attacks, they're going to kill conservatives.
[01:42:03.399 --> 01:42:07.902]  And if the military and police aren't in a war footing, they could beat us getting the jump on us.
[01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:12.705]  Which is why we said have your battle rifles ready to protect yourself if you've been doxxed.
[01:42:12.785 --> 01:42:16.607]  And believe me, I've upped my security and we've done that because this is it.
[01:42:17.268 --> 01:42:19.509]  This is ten times anything we ever saw before.
[01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:22.251]  Now that said, we're gonna beat them.
[01:42:22.491 --> 01:42:23.772]  I think they're gonna back off hopefully.
[01:42:23.812 --> 01:42:25.873]  If you take action and really bust your butts, we can.
[01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.995]  So I gotta be thinking into the future funding here.
[01:42:30.014 --> 01:42:31.695]  That's why they're trying to destroy us.
[01:42:31.715 --> 01:42:33.357]  We need to be here for every future fight.
[01:42:33.637 --> 01:42:34.418]  That's in God's hands.
[01:42:34.498 --> 01:42:35.719]  But God works through people.
[01:42:36.039 --> 01:42:36.699]  I'm in your hands.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.081]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:42:38.981 --> 01:42:41.043]  And we've got 50% off all the supplements.
[01:42:41.063 --> 01:42:41.984]  A lot of them are lost liters.
[01:42:42.284 --> 01:42:45.587]  Free shipping is a huge deal on everything.
[01:42:46.187 --> 01:42:48.329]  And InfoWorksStore.com, InfoWorksLife.com.
[01:42:48.349 --> 01:42:49.890]  Without you, we won't be funded.
[01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:50.971]  You need these great products.
[01:42:51.011 --> 01:42:51.592]  Get a t-shirt.
[01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:52.032]  Get a book.
[01:42:52.312 --> 01:42:53.093]  Get water filtration.
[01:42:53.113 --> 01:42:53.773]  Get air filtration.
[01:42:53.813 --> 01:42:55.094]  Get high-quality, storable foods.
[01:42:55.114 --> 01:42:55.795]  They're 35% off.
[01:42:55.835 --> 01:42:57.316]  And it's all about to end.
[01:42:57.336 --> 01:42:58.017]  I forgot to tell you that.
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:06.223]  You know, it's been said that a lot of people miss the forest for the trees, and I'm one of those people.
[01:43:07.584 --> 01:43:12.086]  I just want to tell the viewers and listeners of InfoWars that you've changed the world.
[01:43:13.246 --> 01:43:26.613]  And the globalists want to shut down InfoWars because it's a place where we can come together and share ideas and where we have culture, where we have kinship, where we are able to interface and realize how similar we really are.
[01:43:27.553 --> 01:43:29.294]  It's a place where we know that we're not alone.
[01:43:31.089 --> 01:43:37.413]  And that's why they filed fake lawsuits against us and written hundreds of thousands of fake news stories that have been syndicated across the world.
[01:43:37.794 --> 01:43:43.658]  It's why they've got HBO and Showtime shows with characters based on me that do horrible, evil, racist things.
[01:43:44.238 --> 01:43:51.143]  But that said, I wanted to just celebrate the fact that, yeah, we're under attack now, and we'll be under attack in the future.
[01:43:52.346 --> 01:43:58.651]  But the globalists are trying to punish Infowars for what you did, what I did, what others did in the past.
[01:43:59.491 --> 01:44:06.337]  So they're literally fighting a past war, like generals always do, instead of fighting the new war.
[01:44:07.317 --> 01:44:14.102]  So, at so many levels, they're already winning when I debate them or I confront them or I try to counter their lies.
[01:44:14.663 --> 01:44:15.564]  They can only disrupt.
[01:44:16.536 --> 01:44:24.023]  And it's important to stay where they're lying, but to move on with our truths and the things that we're saying that they're trying to silence.
[01:44:25.405 --> 01:44:29.689]  They tell all these lies because they want us to then debate them for our honor.
[01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.911]  But they're dishonorable.
[01:44:32.191 --> 01:44:33.352]  They've been proven to be liars.
[01:44:34.253 --> 01:44:35.835]  Our answer is, you're a pack of liars.
[01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:37.316]  Here's my idea.
[01:44:37.817 --> 01:44:39.939]  Here's what I'm promoting, that you don't want to be hurt.
[01:44:40.742 --> 01:44:44.524]  And that's what's happening at InfoWars.com from 8 a.m.
[01:44:44.644 --> 01:44:48.465]  past 10 o'clock at night, every night now, with live broadcast.
[01:44:48.906 --> 01:45:04.993]  Our election coverage, David Knight, Owen Schroyer, myself, and so many others, bringing you true, truth-based information that comes from research and historical understanding and proven sources, not from globalist talking points of disinformation.
[01:45:05.533 --> 01:45:08.416]  But in closing, it takes a lot of money to carry out this fight.
[01:45:08.937 --> 01:45:12.560]  And they're trying to shut down our payment processors right now, they're trying to shut down our shopping carts.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.583]  But as long as your order gets through, it'll be shipped out.
[01:45:15.964 --> 01:45:19.147]  And that's why we've got the biggest sale in our history.
[01:45:19.547 --> 01:45:20.709]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:45:21.029 --> 01:45:23.732]  Free shipping store-wide, 50% off on the supplements.
[01:45:24.292 --> 01:45:29.594]  A lot of products like air filtration, water filtration, don't have 50% markup in them, so we can't do that.
[01:45:29.794 --> 01:45:36.116]  But they've got 10%, 25%, 35% on the highest quality storable food for the price you're going to pay.
[01:45:36.136 --> 01:45:36.896]  There's a nexus point.
[01:45:36.936 --> 01:45:39.137]  You can pay even more and get something technically better.
[01:45:39.357 --> 01:45:40.117]  You pay three times more.
[01:45:40.137 --> 01:45:44.599]  But for the price, being affordable but still being quality, it's that nexus point.
[01:45:44.719 --> 01:45:45.159]  It's the best.
[01:45:45.719 --> 01:45:49.461]  And for select, the water filtration, the very best, super high quality.
[01:45:50.301 --> 01:45:50.841]  It's all there.
[01:45:51.481 --> 01:45:52.582]  And store-wide free shipping.
[01:45:53.983 --> 01:45:59.947]  50% off, so that in case they're able to shut down our merchant accounts, before then, you're able to get the products.
[01:45:59.988 --> 01:46:03.651]  So Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, all rolled into one.
[01:46:03.731 --> 01:46:08.454]  I think we'll make it through this, thanks to your prayers, the fact there's still some free market left in this country.
[01:46:08.474 --> 01:46:09.796]  But let's not count on that.
[01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:17.162]  Let's make sure InfoWars is provisioned for the next few months with your funding and 360Win, you get great products.
[01:46:17.742 --> 01:46:19.283]  Can I plug your products real quick?
[01:46:19.303 --> 01:46:21.104]  Just bought a bunch for the 50% off super sale.
[01:46:21.165 --> 01:46:21.705]  I stocked up on my X2.
[01:46:21.945 --> 01:46:28.850]  Then also the Real Red Pill Plus I think is underrated because if ever I need energy like to work out or whatever I take four of those bad boys and I'm good to go.
[01:46:45.842 --> 01:46:53.249]  Well, I've been taking your products probably the past two, three years, but the past year and a half, it's really helped me a lot, a lot.
[01:46:53.469 --> 01:46:58.754]  If anybody's looking for a product you want to feel, literally, the knockout, dude, every time.
[01:47:03.678 --> 01:47:06.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.365 --> 01:47:15.587]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:16.087 --> 01:47:21.290]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:25.533 --> 01:47:26.794]  They go low, we kick.
[01:47:28.951 --> 01:47:43.696]  And if you see anybody in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.
[01:47:44.176 --> 01:47:47.017]  And you push back on them.
[01:47:47.177 --> 01:47:51.138]  And you tell them they're not welcome.
[01:47:51.278 --> 01:47:54.479]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[01:47:54.499 --> 01:47:57.740]  Maybe there will be.
[01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:09.851]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[01:48:09.871 --> 01:48:14.696]  Get up and, please, get up in the face of some Congress people!
[01:48:14.817 --> 01:48:17.520]  Is this the quote-unquote mob?
[01:48:20.703 --> 01:48:21.845]  The Left and Unhinged Mob.
[01:48:22.964 --> 01:48:35.311]  But we got a clip coming up next hour of all them calling for violence and killing Republicans, but now with no proof, with a bunch of pipe bombs getting mailed to all these different Democrat leaders, they're blaming President Trump and the right's rhetoric.
[01:48:35.892 --> 01:48:39.514]  In fact, have we gone to a search engine and typed in Alex Jones yet and seen if I've been blamed yet?
[01:48:40.074 --> 01:48:42.256]  Because they keep saying Alex Jones is going to cause the violence.
[01:48:43.276 --> 01:48:47.499]  And there's the bomb squads right out of the Hurt Locker, defusing these little pipe bombs.
[01:48:47.999 --> 01:48:50.561]  Alex Jones warned of October surprise.
[01:48:51.954 --> 01:48:53.395]  Attacks on media months ago.
[01:48:53.415 --> 01:48:55.776]  I specifically said two weeks out from the election.
[01:48:56.236 --> 01:48:57.576]  I called it October Surprise.
[01:48:57.676 --> 01:48:58.657]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:48:58.817 --> 01:49:02.818]  Everyone must get this article and get it out to everyone.
[01:49:02.898 --> 01:49:04.739]  It's also posted on NewsWars.com.
[01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:06.600]  They censor InfoWars more.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640]  It's harder to get that out.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.081]  But it is on NewsWars.
[01:49:09.441 --> 01:49:12.622]  Take the NewsWars version and send it out to everyone you know.
[01:49:12.682 --> 01:49:14.663]  Now, Mike Adams, it's a smart cookie.
[01:49:15.896 --> 01:49:18.778]  I'm going to ask him to have the floor in this segment and the short segment coming up.
[01:49:18.798 --> 01:49:21.179]  He can stay longer if he needs to, but I know he's very busy.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.240]  This is history happening.
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.441]  We have people that hate America.
[01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:25.882]  They work for foreign governments.
[01:49:26.202 --> 01:49:27.343]  They work for globalism.
[01:49:27.843 --> 01:49:29.424]  They have a huge unhinged mob.
[01:49:29.484 --> 01:49:32.146]  They have invasion forces coming at us.
[01:49:32.846 --> 01:49:38.570]  We have their own internal documents from Antifa that Alexander Soros is trying to trigger civil unrest and martial law.
[01:49:39.170 --> 01:49:41.451]  Trump must act or it's dereliction of duty.
[01:49:41.712 --> 01:49:43.173]  And I'm not saying he's a bad guy.
[01:49:44.153 --> 01:49:45.475]  I'm the anti-police state guy.
[01:49:45.575 --> 01:49:46.235]  Everybody knows that.
[01:49:46.596 --> 01:49:54.003]  The globalists are the ones trying to overthrow our government, and our republic, and our 2016 election, and our 2018, as you were saying earlier.
[01:49:54.303 --> 01:49:59.248]  The numbers are in on all these big polling and corporate tracking groups showing way higher
[01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:09.157]  Independent and Republican turnout, so there's a big red wave squashing the blue piss puddle of the blue bloods, and they don't know what to do.
[01:50:09.237 --> 01:50:19.425]  So at every metaphysical level, at a gut level, at an instinctive level, at a intellectual level, at just a love level for my family and everybody, this is it?
[01:50:19.905 --> 01:50:24.689]  It's like in Lord of the Rings when the goblins are close, or the orcs, Stinglows blue?
[01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:27.312]  Baby, this sucker's electric blue right now.
[01:50:28.257 --> 01:50:29.761]  I mean, you can hear the war drums!
[01:50:29.821 --> 01:50:31.145]  It's not just the swords blew!
[01:50:31.586 --> 01:50:33.230]  You can hear drums in the deep, baby!
[01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:34.052]  They're coming!
[01:50:34.292 --> 01:50:34.794]  They're here!
[01:50:34.914 --> 01:50:35.475]  Mike Adams!
[01:50:36.544 --> 01:50:38.845]  Alright, here's my full analysis, Alex.
[01:50:39.326 --> 01:50:50.092]  First point, number one, if a device with cylinders and wires were brought into a middle school by a young Muslim boy, it would be called a clock, not a bomb.
[01:50:50.612 --> 01:50:51.733]  So keep that in mind.
[01:50:52.453 --> 01:50:57.856]  Since it's sent to CNN, now it's a bomb, even though apparently there are no explosives involved.
[01:50:58.317 --> 01:51:00.018]  Secondly, anyone who says that
[01:51:00.558 --> 01:51:02.419]  This couldn't possibly be a false flag.
[01:51:03.479 --> 01:51:17.584]  They must be lobotomized because the entire Russia collusion hoax is built on deep state operations, illegal FISA warrants, a fictional Trump dossier, spy embeds in the Trump campaign, and so on.
[01:51:17.984 --> 01:51:19.925]  How can you say, how can anyone say,
[01:51:20.566 --> 01:51:25.848]  That false flags are impossible after becoming aware of the Russia collusion hoax.
[01:51:25.928 --> 01:51:28.069]  Greg Jarrett's book was really excellent on that.
[01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:30.450]  Just laid out the deep state operation.
[01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:42.774]  Plus, we know of course that Obama laundered money internationally in violation of international banking laws in order to supply Iran with funding to build nuclear weapons to destabilize the Middle East.
[01:51:43.575 --> 01:51:44.095]  Next point.
[01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:55.751]  I've warned for many weeks, including on the CounterThink Show that airs on InfoWars each Sunday, that there are two triggers to civil war, the escalation by the left.
[01:51:56.031 --> 01:51:59.054]  The first trigger was the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.
[01:51:59.494 --> 01:52:03.217]  And I predicted an 80% chance of that confirmation succeeding.
[01:52:03.637 --> 01:52:07.880]  The second trigger is if the Republicans hold the House in the midterm elections.
[01:52:08.381 --> 01:52:11.603]  I currently estimate the chance of Republicans holding the House at 60%.
[01:52:13.544 --> 01:52:16.726]  Up from, you know, much lower numbers in previous months.
[01:52:17.346 --> 01:52:23.590]  Nate Silver on the Democrat side thinks that it's an 86% chance of Democrats taking control of the House.
[01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:30.454]  Maybe he's factoring in more false flag bombings or something to get to that number, but I think that number is absurd.
[01:52:30.554 --> 01:52:30.914]  However...
[01:52:31.474 --> 01:52:38.036]  It's crucial for every person to get out and vote because there is a very realistic chance that the Democrats do win the House.
[01:52:38.056 --> 01:52:38.876]  That's still a chance.
[01:52:39.196 --> 01:52:44.177]  I put that at 40% right now, but that could change drastically in the weeks ahead.
[01:52:44.758 --> 01:52:45.318]  Next point.
[01:52:45.718 --> 01:52:46.938]  What's at stake in all of this?
[01:52:47.178 --> 01:52:48.198]  Why the desperation?
[01:52:49.099 --> 01:52:57.781]  Well, it's because the Democrats realize that if they lose this election, if they fail to take the House and fail to take the Senate, which looks almost certain at this point on the Senate side,
[01:52:58.709 --> 01:53:02.445]  The Democrat Globalism Party is
[01:53:03.354 --> 01:53:04.335]  Basically finished.
[01:53:04.435 --> 01:53:23.671]  It will be crushed, because President Trump will fire Jeff Sessions, he'll bring in a new Attorney General, who has already been selected, obviously, behind the scenes, who will then prosecute the deep state criminals, including many of these people who are receiving so-called pipe bombs, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, many others.
[01:53:23.691 --> 01:53:32.098]  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of deep state operatives who need to be prosecuted, including James Comey and John Brennan, Loretta Lynch,
[01:53:33.224 --> 01:53:35.018]  Many, many others inside the system.
[01:53:35.982 --> 01:53:39.424]  They are not being prosecuted by Jeff Sessions for reasons that are not yet clear.
[01:53:39.764 --> 01:53:41.705]  Obviously, they've got something on Sessions.
[01:53:42.045 --> 01:53:49.009]  But a new Attorney General will come in and will expose the deep state, will expose their fraud against democracy.
[01:53:49.529 --> 01:53:55.852]  That fraud, where they tried to steal the 2016 election, they tried to overthrow the elected President of the United States.
[01:53:56.393 --> 01:54:04.157]  As that fraud gets exposed, it will not only collapse the Democrats and their decades-long hold over the politics of America,
[01:54:04.817 --> 01:54:07.139]  It will collapse in terms of credibility.
[01:54:07.779 --> 01:54:13.404]  Many of the media giants, including CNN, which is of course being targeted with this false flag pipe bomb.
[01:54:14.284 --> 01:54:27.594]  The New York Times, The Washington Post will lose tremendous credibility because they will be exposed as being complicit in the conspiracy to try to overthrow the outcome of the 2016 election.
[01:54:27.915 --> 01:54:33.499]  So we're talking about a wholesale exposing of all of these anti-America
[01:54:34.239 --> 01:54:49.877]  Seditious traitors, you might say, who are actively plotting against the United States of America, actively plotting against democracy, who are encouraging the human invasion of our country, our physical borders being destroyed by these people.
[01:54:50.879 --> 01:54:56.063]  And now the Democrats have moved to the radical left, where they are openly talking about destroying the free market system.
[01:54:56.503 --> 01:55:01.827]  They say that in order to save the planet from global warming, they must dismantle all free market economics.
[01:55:02.247 --> 01:55:10.073]  They demand a centralized government-run economy, the end of private enterprise, which means government seizing every small business in America.
[01:55:10.113 --> 01:55:11.955]  This is what the left demands now.
[01:55:12.916 --> 01:55:23.027]  They want to shut down the prisons, release the violent prisoners, but they want to have all violent prisoners who are, or violent criminals who are illegal aliens, to be granted permanent immunity.
[01:55:23.568 --> 01:55:32.198]  So if you're an illegal alien in a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state like California, you can run around, you can commit murder, and you will be let off as already happened.
[01:55:32.678 --> 01:55:35.079]  In San Francisco, due to a jury decision there.
[01:55:35.099 --> 01:55:51.528]  And let's be clear, Mike, Big Tech won't even pay a half a percent tax to take care of homeless, and they're tax exempt, but they're lobbying with Democrat senators, I just saw yesterday, to give all children at birth a government-run fund, so they're government trust fund kids, if they're minorities, controlled by the government.
[01:55:51.768 --> 01:55:54.009]  How obvious is that going to control their voting?
[01:55:54.861 --> 01:55:58.605]  Yeah, well, and Big Tech, look, they've already committed massive fraud in this election.
[01:55:58.805 --> 01:56:02.849]  If, for some reason, the Democrats take the House, it is only under conditions of fraud.
[01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.270]  Think about Facebook.
[01:56:04.311 --> 01:56:10.997]  They ban ads from conservatives, but they allow Beto, for example, in Texas, to have ads all over the place.
[01:56:11.378 --> 01:56:13.540]  They've selectively silenced conservative voices.
[01:56:14.481 --> 01:56:15.582]  The election meddling
[01:56:16.112 --> 01:56:21.697]  That the Democrats blame on the Russians is actually being carried out today, as you well know, by the tech giants themselves.
[01:56:21.997 --> 01:56:22.698]  Massive fraud.
[01:56:23.018 --> 01:56:27.102]  Massive, really criminal operations against the civil rights of Americans.
[01:56:27.142 --> 01:56:29.444]  The tech giants can be prosecuted.
[01:56:29.564 --> 01:56:33.107]  They may be prosecuted after this election if the Republicans hold the House.
[01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:39.753]  The tech giants can be prosecuted for denying the basic civil rights of all Americans in a massive scale.
[01:56:40.194 --> 01:56:42.215]  And they are doing that, of course, to steal the election.
[01:56:42.696 --> 01:56:45.898]  And they're working in concert now, or in parallel, I should say.
[01:56:46.815 --> 01:56:55.699]  With these other operatives that are planning the bombs, sending the bombs, running the media, putting out the false narratives that blame you for the violence, Alex, and other operations.
[01:56:55.719 --> 01:57:02.602]  So this is a multifaceted operation to actually destroy America as we know it.
[01:57:02.622 --> 01:57:05.163]  This is a do-or-die time probably for this country.
[01:57:05.464 --> 01:57:11.626]  Either Trump defends the border, and we win the elections, we hold the House, and we prosecute the tech giants.
[01:57:13.348 --> 01:57:22.234]  The other way, if the Democrats win the House, and the migrants flood the border, and the tech giants continue their censorship, then the Republic is probably lost at that point.
[01:57:23.434 --> 01:57:24.415]  This is real warfare.
[01:57:24.835 --> 01:57:25.556]  This is the future.
[01:57:25.636 --> 01:57:26.476]  This is happening.
[01:57:26.776 --> 01:57:29.658]  They say you can't even say you're a nationalist or an American now.
[01:57:30.018 --> 01:57:31.479]  They are the demoralizing enemy.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.741]  They are making their move now.
[01:57:34.181 --> 01:57:35.922]  Everyone must get this information out.

[02:00:21.877 --> 02:00:26.799]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.343 --> 02:00:41.427]  I'm trying to think of a headline strong enough for when we take this interview and archive it to Infowars.com so you can give it to your friends and family.
[02:00:41.447 --> 02:00:49.611]  Because when you've lived in so much freedom so long, and there's been creeping corruption and evil and traitorous activities with foreign authoritarian powers,
[02:00:51.210 --> 02:01:13.567]  And a witch's brew of America hating Hollywood and the rest of it, working with multinationals to collapse your country, and clearly hyping that conservatives are violent, when you're the ones that are doing 99% of the violence, and then framing Trump and myself and others that we're going to cause violence, and then it all rolls out against the Democrats, 13 days from the election, and I predicted it all, Mike Adams predicted it all,
[02:01:14.625 --> 02:01:15.606]  What do we call this?
[02:01:15.886 --> 02:01:19.009]  America under 21st century military attack.
[02:01:19.449 --> 02:01:20.891]  Democrats are going for broke.
[02:01:22.205 --> 02:01:22.685]  Red alert!
[02:01:22.725 --> 02:01:27.786]  Democrats have launched first phase of massive false flag destabilization attack.
[02:01:27.826 --> 02:01:28.347]  This is it?
[02:01:28.367 --> 02:01:31.908]  I mean, what do we call this interview, Mike?
[02:01:31.968 --> 02:01:34.988]  Because what you call it is what it is.
[02:01:35.148 --> 02:01:37.509]  It's like, how do I reach out to listeners and have them understand?
[02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:38.489]  This isn't a game.
[02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:43.911]  They want me off air because they don't want me on air when they make their frickin' move here, people!
[02:01:44.591 --> 02:01:44.791]  Mike?
[02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:48.531]  The last battle for America.
[02:01:48.611 --> 02:02:01.117]  I mean, if we lose all of this, if the Democrats succeed at every level of their invasion, their overthrow of democracy, their massive domestic terrorism and violence against patriots, then we lose the country.
[02:02:01.557 --> 02:02:14.584]  But if we push back these attacks, and we expose the false flags, and we expose the operatives, and we win the election, we hold the House, and we prosecute the thousands of deep state traitors, we prosecute them.
[02:02:15.211 --> 02:02:17.573]  Then America is reborn.
[02:02:17.613 --> 02:02:18.994]  It's more than just great again.
[02:02:19.274 --> 02:02:20.134]  It's reborn again.
[02:02:20.595 --> 02:02:23.137]  America is saved as a constitutional republic.
[02:02:23.157 --> 02:02:30.802]  So the republic is facing its greatest battle as the forces of globalism prepare their final assault.
[02:02:31.442 --> 02:02:32.603]  Everything is on the line.
[02:02:33.284 --> 02:02:36.086]  And they're at cornered rats as the world awakens to them.
[02:02:36.286 --> 02:02:43.491]  But if they can capture America again, they can use it as an engine that would make the Nazis and the Soviets look like babies.
[02:02:45.268 --> 02:02:49.310]  Well, there are so many areas that must be exposed here.
[02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:58.855]  Not only must we hold the House, win the elections, and prosecute the deep state criminals, but then we have to expose and prosecute the communist tide.
[02:02:59.155 --> 02:03:00.036]  Communist China
[02:03:00.636 --> 02:03:01.797]  We're good to go.
[02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:17.410]  For the future of America here.
[02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:24.432]  This is, if you believe in parallel universes, this is where things diverge, this point right here, over the next 13 days.
[02:03:24.812 --> 02:03:44.277]  You either have a future where you're under a totalitarian techno-regime run by false flag operatives and demonic, you know, Hillary Clinton type of people, Barack Obama back in power in one way or another, or you're gonna have a future where we restore civility, the rule of law,
[02:03:46.737 --> 02:03:47.797]  We protect our borders.
[02:03:47.857 --> 02:03:49.178]  We reject the invasion.
[02:03:49.218 --> 02:03:50.598]  We reject the insanity.
[02:03:51.159 --> 02:04:00.303]  We declare America to be a sovereign nation, once again, that has the right to protect itself from enemies, both foreign and domestic.
[02:04:00.343 --> 02:04:06.466]  So, this is a very polarizing time, obviously, but there's no outcome, Alex, that's in the middle of this.
[02:04:06.526 --> 02:04:08.387]  This is what's so astonishing about this.
[02:04:08.427 --> 02:04:12.869]  In fact, in the election, we're probably either going to win big or lose big.
[02:04:13.473 --> 02:04:20.597]  In mathematical statistics terms, the spread of the results has almost no middle ground.
[02:04:20.657 --> 02:04:23.698]  It's almost like there are two peaks on the two edges.
[02:04:23.758 --> 02:04:27.580]  It's either going to go hard left or it's going to go hard right in this election.
[02:04:28.021 --> 02:04:30.262]  And the polarization has never been this great.
[02:04:30.602 --> 02:04:32.383]  What's at stake has never been this urgent.
[02:04:32.703 --> 02:04:35.164]  Everything right now is at stake for America.
[02:04:35.224 --> 02:04:36.125]  We must all
[02:04:36.805 --> 02:04:40.886]  Demand peace, expose the false flags, and vote to preserve this republic.
[02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:41.507]  That's critical.
[02:04:41.587 --> 02:04:44.647]  We decry the violence, they're the ones doing it, now they're framing us for it.
[02:04:45.068 --> 02:04:54.370]  Back in 60 seconds, since you bring up Big Tech, five more with us, I want to get into the incredible developments with Big Tech and they have the Trump campaign coming out against the censorship and election meddling.
[02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:54.991]  Thank God.
[02:04:55.571 --> 02:04:56.111]  We'll be right back.

[02:05:32.839 --> 02:05:33.199]  Again.
[02:05:33.579 --> 02:05:34.020]  Pretty cool.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:34.880]  But guess what?
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:35.881]  It gets better.

[02:05:44.745 --> 02:05:45.085]  Woo!
[02:05:45.325 --> 02:05:46.346]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:46.366 --> 02:05:47.967]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:48.347 --> 02:05:50.068]  Support the Infowar.
[02:05:50.608 --> 02:05:55.451]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfowarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:29.073 --> 02:06:30.814]  If I grow up, I'm going to defeat the globalists.
[02:06:30.834 --> 02:06:36.516]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:36.917 --> 02:06:39.358]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:41.078 --> 02:06:47.801]  The leftist arm of the CIA, with Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has been the power of this country since the 1990s.
[02:06:47.921 --> 02:06:56.685]  And I cut my teeth in news when the Oklahoma City bombing took place, and I saw the local newscast.
[02:06:57.045 --> 02:06:57.906]  I'm right by Oklahoma.
[02:06:59.935 --> 02:07:23.081]  Reporting on the bombs in the buildings, law enforcement officers, people that worked at HUD, you name it, saying, I saw the press conference that afternoon about the bombing, and it was the guys I saw planting the bombs that told me they were telephone repairmen, but they didn't look like them, who were on the news from the ATF, the FBI, and those Germans they saw.
[02:07:24.401 --> 02:07:26.982]  Now, who was the Attorney General, or Deputy Attorney General at the time?
[02:07:27.022 --> 02:07:28.922]  It was Mr. Holder.
[02:07:31.138 --> 02:07:40.004]  And there were lawsuits by family members of those that died and it came out there was an advanced government team there in Oklahoma City the week before and at the federal building.
[02:07:42.025 --> 02:07:52.792]  So the very same people that I cut my teeth learning about are trying to hold on to power right now to frame conservatives in the Midwest and the South and Christians in America one more time.
[02:07:54.714 --> 02:07:59.657]  And we've got Alexander Soros that funds terror groups like Antifa
[02:08:01.186 --> 02:08:05.087]  Working with Blue City Police, that sends out its own documents, to stage events.
[02:08:07.028 --> 02:08:12.570]  Blaming Trump and blaming the Liberty Movement, before the police even come out and say it's connected to right-wingers.
[02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:15.431]  But obviously it's going to be blamed on Patsy's, or Patsy.
[02:08:16.912 --> 02:08:18.393]  And they're going to be Alex Jones listeners.
[02:08:19.593 --> 02:08:24.615]  Anyone that sees the pre-programming that Alex Jones is telling his listeners they'll shoot and kill media.
[02:08:25.415 --> 02:08:26.996]  Alex Jones is saying bomb people.
[02:08:27.196 --> 02:08:29.837]  There's no video, there's no audio, I say the opposite.
[02:08:31.610 --> 02:08:35.511]  We had a clip of Mike a month ago questioning me about it, just to get it on record.
[02:08:35.531 --> 02:08:37.392]  We're going to play that after he leaves in a moment.
[02:08:38.533 --> 02:08:40.293]  But this is a big, big deal.
[02:08:40.653 --> 02:08:44.555]  New York Times op-ed, George Soros son blames Trump and demonization of opponents.
[02:08:44.775 --> 02:08:51.217]  Oh, you on the left just call everybody Nazis and Hitler and murderers and everything else and lie about everything.
[02:08:52.538 --> 02:08:53.098]  It's incredible.
[02:08:54.518 --> 02:08:58.780]  Exclusive, Brad Parcell, big tech, is meddling with free speech and elections.
[02:08:59.634 --> 02:09:01.195]  Our own Owen Troyer ran into him.
[02:09:02.276 --> 02:09:03.857]  They talked some on camera and some off.
[02:09:03.937 --> 02:09:12.742]  I didn't air it because Parcell, who I know Trump likes, has done a great job as the technologist of the campaign, now the head of the campaign, said, that's up to the White House.
[02:09:12.782 --> 02:09:13.602]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:09:15.243 --> 02:09:17.104]  We said, well, just please make it the central issue.
[02:09:17.144 --> 02:09:18.865]  Well, the next day a big article came out.
[02:09:18.885 --> 02:09:28.491]  Breitbart, he gave a speech as well, saying they're election meddling in the election and they're blocking free speech, which is true.
[02:09:29.708 --> 02:09:33.489]  And that they have the documents and the proof that this is going on.
[02:09:35.609 --> 02:09:40.790]  And meanwhile, San Francisco is allowing non-citizens to vote, but they say we're conspiracy theorists.
[02:09:41.090 --> 02:09:42.191]  That's Associated Press.
[02:09:44.551 --> 02:09:48.652]  Midterm elections, early vote, Republicans versus Democrats, as thousands flock to the polls.
[02:09:49.932 --> 02:09:56.793]  And it gets into the numbers, showing that record numbers of Republicans are voting, pushing towards a big red wave.
[02:09:57.774 --> 02:09:59.094]  But Mike Adams mentioned this.
[02:10:00.874 --> 02:10:01.954]  So I want to get his take on it.
[02:10:04.275 --> 02:10:09.616]  Apple's Tim Cook makes blistering attack on the data industrial complex because he's at the top of the pyramid, you see.
[02:10:09.636 --> 02:10:16.038]  So he's calling out Facebook and others when Apple's the worst and has given the Chinese government control of the cloud.
[02:10:17.658 --> 02:10:20.159]  He takes aim at weaponization of customer data.
[02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:23.259]  It's like he said, I was weaponized and needed to be taken off air.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.260]  He curated me.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:29.461]  Facebook could collapse if election scandals keep coming, author warns.
[02:10:32.665 --> 02:10:32.865]  U.S.
[02:10:32.885 --> 02:10:35.647]  tech giants want to pay for corporate tax to help homeless them.
[02:10:36.767 --> 02:10:43.411]  So, he mentioned that privacy expert resigns from Alphabet, backs smart city project over surveillance concerns.
[02:10:43.451 --> 02:10:45.552]  Hey, you go into the smart city, it tracks everything you do.
[02:10:47.473 --> 02:10:50.735]  That's Gizmodo, talking about Apple, talking about Google's parent company.
[02:10:51.815 --> 02:10:56.838]  So, Mike, spend a few minutes on that and we'll let you get back to your important work on this historical point.
[02:10:58.345 --> 02:10:59.005]  It's do or die.
[02:10:59.045 --> 02:10:59.946]  They're authoritarian.
[02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:02.888]  They're telling us they're going to take our rights and take our speech.
[02:11:02.908 --> 02:11:03.388]  They've done it.
[02:11:05.649 --> 02:11:09.552]  So if we sit here and put up with them, it's really our fault what happens.
[02:11:10.532 --> 02:11:14.475]  So speak to that in closing and what you think the president should do because you got a lot of criticism.
[02:11:15.916 --> 02:11:20.438]  From folks that, oh, Google and Apple promoted their videos when they misrepresented what you said and I said.
[02:11:20.898 --> 02:11:22.579]  You pointed out we're already under a civil emergency.
[02:11:23.199 --> 02:11:26.501]  Trump has to trump their emergency with his own declaration.
[02:11:26.521 --> 02:11:27.741]  That doesn't mean tank us in the streets.
[02:11:28.042 --> 02:11:29.862]  It overrides the previous emergency.
[02:11:30.263 --> 02:11:35.385]  But that he has to do that to clear out some of the bureaucracy that says they can't be fired.
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.501]  And then now here we are.
[02:11:38.541 --> 02:11:39.482]  The country's under siege.
[02:11:39.502 --> 02:11:40.222]  We're under attack.
[02:11:40.623 --> 02:11:41.944]  The false flags are rolling in.
[02:11:41.964 --> 02:11:43.605]  The Democrats are calling for civil emergency.
[02:11:43.965 --> 02:11:45.306]  We're here 13 days out.
[02:11:46.027 --> 02:11:46.547]  Big tech.
[02:11:46.587 --> 02:11:46.988]  Speak to that.
[02:11:47.008 --> 02:11:48.069]  Then what does the president need to do?
[02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:53.773]  Well, once again, you know, we were much very far ahead of the curve of knowing what's coming.
[02:11:53.853 --> 02:11:58.597]  And a lot of people out there are only now starting to realize there is a massive human invasion coming.
[02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:02.340]  Massive domestic terrorism violence being carried out by the left.
[02:12:02.641 --> 02:12:05.243]  And there's an activation day, I believe, among leftists
[02:12:06.036 --> 02:12:19.621]  When they will be told to go ahead and commence their executions, attempted execution of the President, attempted executions of Senators such as Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and so on, that day is probably coming, murdering conservatives in the streets.
[02:12:20.201 --> 02:12:31.605]  And so, my warning is that the left, if they lose this election, the midterms, if they don't control the House, the left is planning such a wave of incredible violence and bombings and arson
[02:12:32.285 --> 02:12:36.953]  That there will be a point where all law-abiding Americans will beg for government help.
[02:12:37.529 --> 02:12:40.692]  That will come in the form of National Guard troops, very likely.
[02:12:41.312 --> 02:12:44.915]  Perhaps a declared form of martial law or emergency powers of some kind.
[02:12:45.195 --> 02:12:46.256]  That was simply my point.
[02:12:46.617 --> 02:13:01.309]  Because just to be able to move safely within your own city or community and not be attacked by these deranged left-wing terrorists and Antifa mobs, you're going to have to really call for some kind of civility, some kind of law and order.
[02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:03.311]  And that was the point of my message.
[02:13:03.351 --> 02:13:03.671]  But look,
[02:13:04.389 --> 02:13:08.630]  Freedom of information is incompatible with the goals of the globalists.
[02:13:09.091 --> 02:13:12.672]  And that's why the tech giants are engaged in such censorship right now.
[02:13:13.092 --> 02:13:20.354]  Because democracy cannot be allowed to exist if the globalists are to have power.
[02:13:20.394 --> 02:13:28.397]  Because if people have good information and the freedom to vote, they will vote against the concentration of power in the hands of the few.
[02:13:29.170 --> 02:13:32.511]  They will vote for the decentralization of information.
[02:13:32.551 --> 02:13:33.992]  They will vote for independent media.
[02:13:34.012 --> 02:13:37.673]  They will vote for candidates like President Trump who love their country.
[02:13:37.693 --> 02:13:42.455]  He called himself a nationalist the other day at a rally and he's correct.
[02:13:42.955 --> 02:13:51.297]  What's wrong with loving your own country and simply believing that your borders must be protected just like Japan believes or Mexico believes?
[02:13:51.418 --> 02:13:55.039]  And if you have that attitude, your country becomes successful because you have good morale.
[02:13:55.279 --> 02:13:58.440]  This is a classic military attack trying to demoralize us.
[02:13:59.802 --> 02:14:00.683]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:14:00.723 --> 02:14:17.480]  So, if you think about it, what you are doing and what I am doing and others in the independent media, thousands of us, that spreading of information and independent analysis is absolutely incompatible with the information authoritarian goals of the globalists.
[02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:19.442]  And that's why the censorship is happening.
[02:14:19.622 --> 02:14:20.002]  No, that's right.
[02:14:41.084 --> 02:14:41.524]  We're good to go.
[02:15:05.049 --> 02:15:06.470]  Taking us to civil emergency.
[02:15:06.690 --> 02:15:08.532]  We're not the ones taking us into martial law.
[02:15:08.752 --> 02:15:10.173]  We're not the ones that want a shooting war.
[02:15:10.453 --> 02:15:14.376]  But we can't stand back as they turn the heat up and escalate into this crap.
[02:15:14.777 --> 02:15:18.039]  And then staged up to make themselves the victims in the middle of their attack.
[02:15:18.479 --> 02:15:20.021]  We're in the middle of their attack.
[02:15:20.401 --> 02:15:22.382]  They're now pulling this false flag to be victims.
[02:15:22.602 --> 02:15:24.744]  They're a bunch of crazed power mad maniacs.
[02:15:25.184 --> 02:15:27.947]  And we will not let people like Alexander Soros break our will.
[02:15:28.706 --> 02:15:32.638]  We will not be violent towards that pile of crap because he's going to face the jury.
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:34.845]  We are going to take it back politically.
[02:15:34.925 --> 02:15:35.427]  Mike Adams.
[02:15:36.175 --> 02:15:41.220]  Well, we take a defensive posture, but we have the right to defend our nation against an invasion.
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:42.601]  Each state has a right.
[02:15:42.661 --> 02:15:47.065]  The state of Texas has a right to defend itself against an invasion without federal authority.
[02:15:47.145 --> 02:15:52.950]  Well, we've already been under invasion, and now they're just fully collapsing it to plant a flag on us and piss on us.
[02:15:53.291 --> 02:15:54.732]  MikeAdamsNaturalNews.com.
[02:15:54.772 --> 02:15:55.273]  Great job.
[02:15:55.333 --> 02:15:56.334]  InfoWars.com.
[02:15:56.674 --> 02:15:57.575]  Tons of analysis.
[02:15:57.595 --> 02:15:59.737]  This is the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[02:16:05.396 --> 02:16:05.976]  Did you hear?
[02:16:06.356 --> 02:16:08.317]  Christmas is coming in October.
[02:16:08.337 --> 02:16:09.818]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[02:16:10.358 --> 02:16:11.939]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[02:16:11.959 --> 02:16:18.822]  But what's really coming in October is incredible deals, 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[02:16:19.562 --> 02:16:26.685]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[02:16:27.385 --> 02:16:32.067]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo bird.
[02:16:33.268 --> 02:16:36.749]  For the way the dinosaurs, because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[02:16:36.769 --> 02:16:47.732]  Now you've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[02:16:48.432 --> 02:16:53.193]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[02:16:53.253 --> 02:16:57.474]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[02:17:00.015 --> 02:17:13.368]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[02:17:13.928 --> 02:17:18.773]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[02:17:19.253 --> 02:17:24.639]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[02:17:25.039 --> 02:17:26.120]  Black Friday's coming early.
[02:17:26.986 --> 02:17:28.166]  Cyber Monday's coming up.
[02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:34.288]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[02:17:34.868 --> 02:17:40.249]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:48.591]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[02:17:49.471 --> 02:17:51.612]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:17:52.825 --> 02:18:00.887]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Grudge Report put him to video and audio.
[02:18:00.967 --> 02:18:02.787]  Number one in the election of Trump.
[02:18:03.207 --> 02:18:07.888]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[02:18:08.408 --> 02:18:11.609]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[02:18:12.209 --> 02:18:17.150]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processes.

[02:18:50.438 --> 02:18:51.979]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.

[02:19:03.745 --> 02:19:04.965]  Christmas is only two months away.
[02:19:05.746 --> 02:19:08.367]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products to win-win.

[02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:15.291]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability

[02:19:20.693 --> 02:19:22.915]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[02:19:23.675 --> 02:19:24.375]  Nobody's got that.
[02:19:25.116 --> 02:19:25.996]  Credit card processing.
[02:19:26.396 --> 02:19:28.437]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[02:19:28.697 --> 02:19:29.298]  We expose them.
[02:19:29.478 --> 02:19:33.400]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[02:19:50.485 --> 02:19:51.366]  I'm counting on you.
[02:19:51.626 --> 02:19:52.547]  You always come through.
[02:19:52.867 --> 02:19:53.628]  Take advantage of this.
[02:19:53.648 --> 02:19:55.810]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[02:20:03.633 --> 02:20:15.378]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.101 --> 02:20:23.302]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:26.263]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:26.764 --> 02:20:29.145]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:30.285 --> 02:20:31.286]  Show Melania Trump
[02:20:32.375 --> 02:20:36.439]  Never hard to listen to, or hard on the eyes, is he's talking about the opioid crisis right now.
[02:20:36.759 --> 02:20:51.534]  Trump's set to come out in just a minute and speak on the pipe bombs that have been mailed, which magically none of them detonated, thank God, that are being blamed on him by the entire mainstream media, and George Soros' son, and others, even though they're the ones that have been calling for violence everywhere.
[02:20:52.395 --> 02:20:55.118]  And again, I told you, this is building towards the election.
[02:20:55.198 --> 02:20:56.399]  Total false flag in my view.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:01.365]  We don't know what deep state groups are behind it, but we know who has the motive and who stands to gain.
[02:21:01.906 --> 02:21:09.394]  Trump administration has, again, condemned the attempted violent attacks against Clintons, Obamas, and suspicious packages that have been found.
[02:21:09.455 --> 02:21:10.676]  So, there you go.
[02:21:10.736 --> 02:21:12.118]  Let's go to Melania Trump right now.
[02:21:13.899 --> 02:21:15.142]  Thank you.
[02:21:25.879 --> 02:21:30.302]  What I constantly hear is the need for support at all levels.
[02:21:31.323 --> 02:21:39.948]  Law enforcement needs our support and the resources necessary to stop criminals from putting drugs on the streets.
[02:21:40.889 --> 02:21:47.433]  Families need the resources to get treatment and follow-up care for loved ones.
[02:21:47.854 --> 02:21:51.996]  Alright, we'll go back and check in with her as soon as President Trump comes out to get his comment.
[02:21:52.377 --> 02:21:55.599]  But it's funny, I even had a little video we were going to play today that's Melania Trump
[02:21:56.239 --> 02:22:00.221]  The Lord's Prayer with video of violent celebs cut to it.
[02:22:00.241 --> 02:22:00.641]  Here it is.
[02:22:01.841 --> 02:22:02.802]  Let us pray.
[02:22:02.822 --> 02:22:14.946]  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[02:22:15.967 --> 02:22:21.149]  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
[02:22:22.009 --> 02:22:31.660]  As we forgive those who trespasses against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:38.307]  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever.
[02:22:38.888 --> 02:22:39.228]  Amen.
[02:22:40.069 --> 02:22:42.012]  Boy, they hate the Christianity of Trump.
[02:22:42.032 --> 02:22:44.515]  The fact that Trump, his wife especially, loves God.
[02:22:45.176 --> 02:22:47.800]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you get to see the video of the left acting violent.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:51.465]  That was just audio, but here's video and audio of Hollywood's message to Trump.
[02:22:51.485 --> 02:22:52.246]  Here's just part of it.
[02:22:53.976 --> 02:22:54.696]  He's not a tough guy.
[02:22:54.716 --> 02:22:56.177]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[02:22:56.317 --> 02:22:56.997]  He's a punk.
[02:22:57.997 --> 02:22:58.757]  He's a dog.
[02:22:58.997 --> 02:23:00.278]  He's a pig.
[02:23:00.558 --> 02:23:02.198]  And he can suck my f***ing a**.
[02:23:02.218 --> 02:23:04.619]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:23:04.839 --> 02:23:08.880]  I'll meet him in a hotel room every motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:10.321]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[02:23:10.641 --> 02:23:14.882]  Kiss my motherf***ing a**, you bitch, punk, f***ing sucker.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:30.302]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun at the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard... Alright, the President's coming out.
[02:23:30.342 --> 02:23:31.343]  Of course, this is an old video.
[02:23:31.363 --> 02:23:34.624]  We've got all the new ones of Rosie O'Donnell saying, take him out with the military at the White House.
[02:23:35.024 --> 02:23:40.606]  We've got the new stuff of MSNBC and Morning Joe saying, 25th Amendment, remove him.
[02:23:41.106 --> 02:23:44.687]  Oh, but now he's got to say we're against violence, when he's been against it the whole time.
[02:23:44.887 --> 02:23:46.148]  Here's the President, live, right now.
[02:23:51.024 --> 02:23:52.385]  I want to thank you very much, Melania.
[02:23:52.425 --> 02:23:53.787]  I know how hard you've worked on this.
[02:23:54.728 --> 02:23:57.470]  And that's just one of many languages that you know.
[02:23:57.490 --> 02:24:00.093]  So it's just amazing the way you can do it.
[02:24:00.133 --> 02:24:01.214]  Thank you very much, darling.
[02:24:01.234 --> 02:24:01.815]  Appreciate it.
[02:24:02.976 --> 02:24:05.838]  Also, I want to thank Mrs. Pence for being here.
[02:24:06.739 --> 02:24:10.963]  You have been just so terrific working alongside of our great Vice President.
[02:24:11.023 --> 02:24:12.165]  And thank you very much, Karen.
[02:24:12.545 --> 02:24:13.426]  Really appreciate it.
[02:24:22.205 --> 02:24:32.533]  I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages and devices mailed to current and former high-ranking government officials.
[02:24:33.294 --> 02:24:39.759]  The safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority.
[02:24:40.699 --> 02:24:47.865]  I have just concluded a briefing with the FBI, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the U.S.
[02:24:47.905 --> 02:24:48.706]  Secret Service.
[02:24:49.688 --> 02:24:58.550]  As we speak, the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts and a major federal investigation is now underway.
[02:24:59.611 --> 02:25:09.073]  The full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice.
[02:25:09.933 --> 02:25:12.974]  We will spare no resources or expense in this effort.
[02:25:14.632 --> 02:25:19.516]  And I just want to tell you that in these times, we have to unify.
[02:25:19.536 --> 02:25:33.267]  We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.
[02:25:34.673 --> 02:25:40.697]  You know, when they had the attacks on the Jewish centers right after he got elected, he said he thought it was a false flag as law enforcement told him.
[02:25:41.057 --> 02:25:41.717]  Turned out it was.
[02:25:41.837 --> 02:25:43.218]  He was criticized for being right, though.
[02:25:43.799 --> 02:25:44.759]  You know what Trump really knows.
[02:25:44.779 --> 02:25:45.700]  He knows who has the motive.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:47.561]  But see, that's what my job is.
[02:25:48.201 --> 02:25:49.242]  He can't say it as president.
[02:25:49.522 --> 02:25:50.122]  He'll say it later.
[02:25:51.003 --> 02:25:52.764]  When we catch him.
[02:25:52.784 --> 02:25:53.304]  I can say it.
[02:25:53.324 --> 02:25:54.845]  Want to blame Trump?
[02:25:54.865 --> 02:25:55.446]  Want to blame me?
[02:25:55.526 --> 02:25:55.906]  Good luck.
[02:25:56.843 --> 02:25:58.684]  It's a very bipartisan statement.
[02:25:58.724 --> 02:26:01.526]  I can tell you from both sides, we both agree on that.
[02:26:02.526 --> 02:26:09.110]  This egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans.
[02:26:09.611 --> 02:26:13.993]  My administration will provide additional updates as they become available.
[02:26:14.974 --> 02:26:17.415]  And I just want to thank everybody for their understanding.
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:25.762]  We're extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning.
[02:26:25.782 --> 02:26:26.543]  It's terrible.
[02:26:26.603 --> 02:26:28.023]  And we will get to the bottom of it.
[02:26:28.043 --> 02:26:29.444]  We'll get to the bottom of it.
[02:26:29.704 --> 02:26:35.045]  We're gathered together today to address America's drug and opioid crisis.
[02:26:35.065 --> 02:26:36.006]  It's a real crisis.
[02:26:36.326 --> 02:26:36.606]  It is.
[02:26:37.486 --> 02:26:39.207]  Which now claims 70,000 lives.
[02:26:39.387 --> 02:26:41.548]  Okay, so here's Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:26:41.568 --> 02:26:42.688]  There's so many clips now.
[02:26:42.888 --> 02:26:44.849]  It just gets lost in the cacophony.
[02:26:45.729 --> 02:26:52.991]  Of the monkey-like creatures like her, sitting up in their trees, chirping the same message and throwing little balls of poopy at us.
[02:26:53.951 --> 02:26:56.972]  But she's not going to go blow up the White House, or she's not going to attack the military.
[02:26:57.593 --> 02:26:59.013]  She just wants somebody else to do it.
[02:26:59.793 --> 02:27:00.954]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:27:01.394 --> 02:27:02.274]  So here she is.
[02:27:03.144 --> 02:27:10.348]  For when he was elected, what I wrote on Twitter was, we should impose martial law until we make sure that the Russians weren't involved in the final balance of the votes.
[02:27:10.388 --> 02:27:13.310]  And Bob Mueller has indicted 13 Russians for election meddling.
[02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:14.611]  And people were like, martial law?
[02:27:14.631 --> 02:27:15.431]  What's wrong with you?
[02:27:15.471 --> 02:27:16.292]  You're a lunatic!
[02:27:16.492 --> 02:27:20.795]  He wants to send the military to the border, so... I would have sent the military to the White House to get him.
[02:27:21.135 --> 02:27:23.596]  So let's be clear.
[02:27:24.557 --> 02:27:29.760]  He indicted 13 unnamed Russians that were bots, and that's all been basically sidelined.
[02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:34.956]  Folks, I've had the Mueller people try to come after me.
[02:27:35.837 --> 02:27:36.378]  It's insane.
[02:27:37.219 --> 02:27:38.461]  It's Hillary in bed with the Russians.
[02:27:39.262 --> 02:27:40.404]  And everybody knows that.
[02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:41.526]  Everybody understands that.
[02:27:42.902 --> 02:27:48.105]  You think the Russians have Trump shipping all those weapons into Ukraine and kicking the hell out of them and cutting their energy supply off?
[02:27:48.145 --> 02:27:49.565]  I think Trump's been too hard on Russia.
[02:27:50.246 --> 02:27:51.866]  And a lot of that's because he's getting bullied into it.
[02:27:51.886 --> 02:27:52.747]  It's one of his few failings.
[02:27:53.187 --> 02:27:57.869]  We should be linking up with Russia, be able to stop radical Islam, China, you name it, and work together.
[02:27:57.889 --> 02:28:03.452]  And then once China isn't under globalist control, because the globalists put communism there, we want to work with China.
[02:28:04.432 --> 02:28:04.712]  All right.
[02:28:06.013 --> 02:28:10.795]  Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot hype to you enough how much danger we're all in.
[02:28:11.456 --> 02:28:12.036]  I cannot do it.
[02:28:14.921 --> 02:28:27.718]  You've seen every step of the way how they're staging it, how they've shed it all up, that Trump and Alex Jones and talk radio and the internet have to all be censored and Trump has to be removed because he wants violence and then he never says that.
[02:28:28.956 --> 02:28:32.257]  And then they are saying, we have seven ways from Sunday to get him.
[02:28:32.297 --> 02:28:33.037]  We're going to kill him.
[02:28:33.057 --> 02:28:33.897]  We're going to take him out.
[02:28:33.917 --> 02:28:35.097]  We're going to rape his wife.
[02:28:35.117 --> 02:28:36.257]  We're going to rape his son.
[02:28:36.277 --> 02:28:37.077]  We're going to kidnap him.
[02:28:37.257 --> 02:28:38.238]  They don't get kicked off Twitter.
[02:28:38.458 --> 02:28:39.098]  Prominent people.
[02:28:39.678 --> 02:28:46.179]  You've got Twitter accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers run by professors that coordinate harassing people and threatening them and death-threatening people.
[02:28:46.219 --> 02:28:47.439]  And it's OK.
[02:28:47.799 --> 02:28:50.040]  And then they lie about us and say we're calling for violence.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.180]  Now, who stands to gain from this?
[02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:52.580]  They do.
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.400]  Who has a motive?
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:53.920]  They do.
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:54.780]  Who has a history?
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:55.140]  They do.
[02:28:55.801 --> 02:28:58.201]  It's as obvious as the nose on your face.
[02:29:02.822 --> 02:29:05.984]  Okay, so I have a gift here from the folks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:06.124 --> 02:29:12.249]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea, so they just brought me a gift.
[02:29:12.269 --> 02:29:13.370]  I don't even know what this is.
[02:29:13.390 --> 02:29:16.272]  Let's see what's going on.
[02:29:16.312 --> 02:29:16.772]  Wait a second.
[02:29:16.852 --> 02:29:17.052]  No!
[02:29:18.373 --> 02:29:18.673]  No!
[02:29:19.174 --> 02:29:19.734]  I got it!
[02:29:21.375 --> 02:29:22.656]  It's a Trump-inducing shirt!
[02:29:22.676 --> 02:29:23.417]  Look at that, guys!
[02:29:26.972 --> 02:29:28.473]  I got the Trump Medusa shirt!
[02:29:29.173 --> 02:29:29.473]  What's that?
[02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:30.194]  There's more in there?
[02:29:30.654 --> 02:29:30.774]  Oh!
[02:29:32.395 --> 02:29:33.676]  It's a George Washington!
[02:29:34.016 --> 02:29:34.436]  Wow!
[02:29:35.637 --> 02:29:37.098]  I was not expecting this, really.
[02:29:37.138 --> 02:29:37.838]  Look at that one.
[02:29:38.358 --> 02:29:39.859]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:41.060]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:42.761 --> 02:29:43.361]  Wow, wow.
[02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:45.802]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[02:29:45.822 --> 02:29:46.623]  Man!
[02:29:47.483 --> 02:29:49.665]  I want to thank the folks at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:49.985 --> 02:29:50.745]  This is amazing.
[02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:51.966]  I was not expecting this.
[02:29:59.266 --> 02:30:07.490]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:07.690 --> 02:30:08.911]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:13.473]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:13.893 --> 02:30:18.916]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:19.136 --> 02:30:39.393]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:30:39.893 --> 02:30:43.657]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:30:43.897 --> 02:30:47.321]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:30:47.601 --> 02:30:52.105]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:30:52.626 --> 02:30:54.628]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:57.971]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:59.438 --> 02:31:03.123]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[02:31:03.403 --> 02:31:06.827]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[02:31:07.188 --> 02:31:16.720]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:17.621]  ...study.
[02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:20.643]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[02:31:21.004 --> 02:31:25.968]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:31:26.029 --> 02:31:28.391]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:33.295]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[02:31:33.335 --> 02:31:33.916]  Ah, you don't want that.
[02:31:34.316 --> 02:31:38.118]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[02:31:38.338 --> 02:31:41.000]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:44.582]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[02:31:44.942 --> 02:31:50.245]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[02:31:50.325 --> 02:31:54.468]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[02:31:55.328 --> 02:31:58.010]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:11.572]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:32:12.032 --> 02:32:23.075]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.

[02:33:03.085 --> 02:33:05.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.502 --> 02:33:12.622]  You've got it.
[02:33:12.843 --> 02:33:18.565]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:18.645 --> 02:33:22.726]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:23.046 --> 02:33:24.887]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.987 --> 02:33:28.709]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:30.409 --> 02:33:32.570]  Are we seeing the earth?
[02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:35.031]  You've got it.
[02:33:35.211 --> 02:33:38.892]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[02:33:38.953 --> 02:33:39.973]  You've got it.
[02:33:54.762 --> 02:34:09.474]  Ladies and gentlemen, you'd have to be really stupid not to see the mainstream corporate media hype up that Alex Jones, Infowars, and President Trump are calling for violence against the media, and there is none of that out there.
[02:34:10.555 --> 02:34:15.399]  And that they're the ones calling for violence against nationalists, conservatives, and others, and doing all this.
[02:34:17.281 --> 02:34:31.952]  Now we're looking into this right now, and the photo put out that they're saying that the pipe bomb sent to CNN, John Brennan, funny enough isn't admitted Wahhabis, converted to Saudi Arabia, has the ISIS flag on it.
[02:34:32.732 --> 02:34:35.995]  Now on the internet, I don't know if this is blurred, but maybe we can put the tweet up ourselves.
[02:34:37.096 --> 02:34:46.763]  If you look at that, that is the sticker, the opposite direction, curled around the little baby pipe bomb.
[02:34:49.096 --> 02:35:01.067]  Now, again, that would be stuck on there as a joke, because it looks like there's a picture of John Brennan right next to it, and the ISIS flag.
[02:35:01.107 --> 02:35:06.371]  The message is, you're a member of ISIS, which Obama and Brennan did back ISIS.
[02:35:06.511 --> 02:35:10.034]  That's just an al-Qaeda arm, al-Nusra, you name it, all the same group of hobbyists.
[02:35:10.835 --> 02:35:15.940]  And so they could spin that, that, oh, a right-wing group mad at him for his connections to ISIS.
[02:35:17.321 --> 02:35:19.202]  And Al Qaeda sent the bomb as a message.
[02:35:19.362 --> 02:35:21.523]  That's one permutation.
[02:35:22.803 --> 02:35:26.965]  Because that looks like John Brennan in the picture.
[02:35:27.945 --> 02:35:28.505]  Again, I don't know.
[02:35:28.545 --> 02:35:29.766]  That's a little bit blurred over the internet.
[02:35:29.786 --> 02:35:31.046]  A little bit clearer for me.
[02:35:31.246 --> 02:35:32.187]  Can we blow that up, guys?
[02:35:32.927 --> 02:35:33.147]  Nope.
[02:35:33.287 --> 02:35:33.987]  No pun intended.
[02:35:34.007 --> 02:35:36.308]  They'll have a CNN headline.
[02:35:36.328 --> 02:35:37.549]  Jones said, blow it up.
[02:35:37.649 --> 02:35:38.589]  Put quotes around it.
[02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:42.971]  I meant zoom in on Brennan right there.
[02:35:43.051 --> 02:35:43.631]  That's Brennan.
[02:35:45.049 --> 02:35:50.335]  You can see the sticker, it's just turned the other way, curled around, on ISIS flag.
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:36:00.408]  Adon Salazar is publishing an article on this as we speak at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:01.894 --> 02:36:04.035]  It'll also be posted on NewsWars.com.
[02:36:04.895 --> 02:36:09.157]  And for now, they're not censoring NewsWars.com as much on Twitter and Facebook and places.
[02:36:09.418 --> 02:36:11.919]  InfoWars is like the devil's seed.
[02:36:12.659 --> 02:36:14.200]  Which means people pay attention to it on the street.
[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:16.741]  They pay attention to it when you talk to them at church.
[02:36:16.761 --> 02:36:17.922]  Hey, this is the verboten.
[02:36:17.962 --> 02:36:18.802]  Check out InfoWars.
[02:36:19.182 --> 02:36:19.662]  That's great.
[02:36:20.083 --> 02:36:23.104]  But online, the bots, the AI, the censors, they don't like it.
[02:36:23.164 --> 02:36:24.485]  So NewsWars.com.
[02:36:25.565 --> 02:36:27.066]  We have the backup PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:28.735 --> 02:36:34.056]  And we're going to be launching new sites in the future that are just, quote, more mainline news.
[02:36:34.116 --> 02:36:37.037]  By mainline, I mean they won't really have Infowars affiliation.
[02:36:38.477 --> 02:36:44.098]  They'll just be hard-hitting news information to get around the old, the old body watts.
[02:36:48.019 --> 02:36:50.300]  Because even when I'm doing something secret, I tell everybody.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.600]  That's just how I operate.
[02:36:52.836 --> 02:36:58.501]  So Trump admin condemns attempted violent attacks against Clintons, Obamas after suspicious packages found.
[02:37:00.963 --> 02:37:05.027]  Notice when all that Ryerson got mailed to Ted Cruz and Trump and everybody, you barely heard any news about it.
[02:37:05.047 --> 02:37:07.669]  Because if a terror attack's real, you don't want to give it any attention.
[02:37:08.249 --> 02:37:09.611]  Instead, with these pipe bombs,
[02:37:11.118 --> 02:37:27.771]  They're trying to get out of the news, their giant illegal alien army marching up, because they don't want that to get demonized, as it should be, a bunch of foreigners, 80% military age men, waving foreign flags, saying we hate America, America's Nazi, burning American flags.
[02:37:28.312 --> 02:37:35.097]  They want to wait until it gets up here, so they can have the media zoom in only on little kids, and say, look, Trump's taking little kids!
[02:37:35.337 --> 02:37:38.880]  We have no idea who they are, they have no ID, they show up with 50,000 illegals,
[02:37:41.087 --> 02:37:42.548]  We need to find out who you are, little girl!
[02:37:42.688 --> 02:37:43.349]  No!
[02:37:43.949 --> 02:37:45.630]  You dirty white Nazi!
[02:37:49.553 --> 02:37:52.335]  Meanwhile, it's all a cold-blooded plan by a real Nazi, George Soros.
[02:37:52.655 --> 02:37:59.360]  In fact, later, I want to play the full, it's the final Soros piece, is what we call it.
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:02.462]  Did you guys pull that up earlier?
[02:38:03.803 --> 02:38:07.964]  I want to play the whole Soros is a Nazi thing because that's what they want me off the internet about.
[02:38:08.264 --> 02:38:08.644]  But guess what?
[02:38:08.664 --> 02:38:09.885]  It's in D'Souza's film.
[02:38:10.305 --> 02:38:11.365]  You were on 60 Minutes.
[02:38:11.385 --> 02:38:12.265]  You were on NPR.
[02:38:12.285 --> 02:38:12.906]  You wrote a book.
[02:38:13.186 --> 02:38:15.226]  You said it was the best time of your life helping round up Jews.
[02:38:16.507 --> 02:38:17.587]  Now the headlines everywhere.
[02:38:17.647 --> 02:38:21.048]  George Soros, who survived the Nazis.
[02:38:21.788 --> 02:38:23.028]  Holocaust survivor.
[02:38:23.048 --> 02:38:28.010]  Wow, that's sick, isn't it?
[02:38:29.050 --> 02:38:31.831]  Well, see, that's the fun of calling me a Nazi when he
[02:38:32.876 --> 02:38:33.737]  Is a collaborator.
[02:38:33.757 --> 02:38:37.459]  You know, there's only one thing they say worse than a group coming to enslave you.
[02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:40.842]  It's your own people working to help do it.
[02:38:43.904 --> 02:38:44.964]  Happy making time.
[02:38:46.105 --> 02:38:47.326]  It was happy making.
[02:38:48.367 --> 02:38:51.269]  I ever start like a hamburger place and I'm gonna try to rip off McDonald's.
[02:38:51.289 --> 02:38:52.169]  It won't be a happy meal.
[02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:54.171]  It'll be a happy making meal.
[02:38:55.271 --> 02:38:56.092]  Happy making.
[02:38:57.573 --> 02:38:59.694]  This morning I told my wife, I said, let's happy make.
[02:38:59.714 --> 02:39:00.215]  I actually did.
[02:39:00.970 --> 02:39:02.030]  I said, let's happy make.
[02:39:03.471 --> 02:39:04.211]  Happy making.
[02:39:05.912 --> 02:39:07.172]  The invention of George Soros.
[02:39:08.693 --> 02:39:09.813]  I feel no guilt at all.
[02:39:09.833 --> 02:39:11.714]  It was happy making.
[02:39:12.614 --> 02:39:19.137]  And my son Alex, who funds terror groups publicly, Alexander Soros, he is making happy make.
[02:39:19.197 --> 02:39:20.818]  He's almost psychotic than I am.
[02:39:21.538 --> 02:39:24.359]  But he's going to really get you one way or the other.
[02:39:24.779 --> 02:39:26.080]  Okay, so that's how it is.
[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:28.461]  So.
[02:39:30.014 --> 02:39:30.735]  That's what's going on.
[02:39:30.775 --> 02:39:31.896]  You don't have all these other clips here.
[02:39:33.177 --> 02:39:34.958]  Maxine Waters says harass the cabinet.
[02:39:35.519 --> 02:39:37.040]  Rob Reiner says we're in a civil war.
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:39.682]  Schumer says Intel has six ways to Sunday.
[02:39:40.183 --> 02:39:41.704]  Mudd says we're going to kill the president.
[02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:42.645]  Brzezinski.
[02:39:42.885 --> 02:39:47.509]  Let's just play those starting with Maxine Waters in sequential order if we can.
[02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:49.051]  Take it away, Matt.
[02:39:52.329 --> 02:40:03.415]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[02:40:04.576 --> 02:40:06.017]  And you push back on them!
[02:40:06.657 --> 02:40:11.060]  And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere!
[02:40:12.302 --> 02:40:25.601]  And it goes on and on, and you see the people that he hires that are in his administration, and we see that this now becomes the last battle of the Civil War.
[02:40:27.383 --> 02:40:28.825]  And we're fighting it right now.
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:30.881]  And we're gonna win!
[02:40:30.901 --> 02:40:32.102]  We're gonna win!
[02:40:32.382 --> 02:40:36.985]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[02:40:37.526 --> 02:40:43.130]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[02:40:43.917 --> 02:40:45.218]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[02:40:45.498 --> 02:40:48.019]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[02:40:48.419 --> 02:40:53.962]  Like, what more do you need to hear from him to start thinking 25th Amendment or something else?
[02:40:54.783 --> 02:40:55.823]  This is not okay.
[02:40:56.544 --> 02:40:57.584]  This is not normal.
[02:40:58.025 --> 02:40:59.125]  And this is where we are.
[02:40:59.145 --> 02:41:05.689]  And let's hear Rosie O'Donnell call for martial law and using the military to take Trump out.
[02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:13.577]  Just to put a cherry on top, because they're the ones telling you that Alex Jones and Donald Trump are calling to kill the media.
[02:41:13.717 --> 02:41:14.558]  You've seen that headline ever.
[02:41:14.818 --> 02:41:17.200]  Jones says kill the media, Trump says kill the media.
[02:41:17.981 --> 02:41:18.561]  Doesn't exist.
[02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:19.883]  I've offered a million dollars.
[02:41:22.025 --> 02:41:22.565]  They don't care.
[02:41:22.625 --> 02:41:26.369]  When they blow up their own facilities, or bomb themselves,
[02:41:27.970 --> 02:41:31.215]  They're gonna be up there as professional victims blaming us.
[02:41:31.836 --> 02:41:33.658]  And that's why they're trying to shut us down ahead of it.
[02:41:33.678 --> 02:41:34.600]  This is so clear.
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:36.042]  It's so crystal clear.
[02:41:36.382 --> 02:41:36.923]  Here he is.
[02:41:38.766 --> 02:41:39.366]  Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:41:40.266 --> 02:41:47.491]  For when he was elected, what I wrote on Twitter was, we should impose martial law until we make sure that the Russians weren't involved in the final tallies of the votes.
[02:41:47.511 --> 02:41:50.453]  And Bob Mueller has indicted 13 Russians for election meddling.
[02:41:50.513 --> 02:41:51.734]  And people were like, martial law?
[02:41:51.754 --> 02:41:52.555]  What's wrong with you?
[02:41:52.595 --> 02:41:53.535]  You're a lunatic!
[02:41:53.595 --> 02:42:00.140]  He wants to send the military to the border, so... I want to send the military to the White House to get him.
[02:42:01.601 --> 02:42:08.806]  It's in the Constitution that the federal government coins the money, controls the border, has a navy,
[02:42:10.618 --> 02:42:13.240]  Has treaties that the President does go through Congress.
[02:42:14.621 --> 02:42:15.942]  And deals with interstate commerce.
[02:42:16.022 --> 02:42:17.543]  I mean, it's supposed to, Rosie.
[02:42:18.523 --> 02:42:21.625]  He wants to put the military on the border like every other country has!
[02:42:22.766 --> 02:42:24.587]  That's where the military is, dumbass!
[02:42:25.048 --> 02:42:25.428]  But you know what?
[02:42:25.448 --> 02:42:26.189]  You're not a dumbass.
[02:42:26.209 --> 02:42:32.793]  You're an elitist establishment person, an actress, that gets her talking points to go out and say what she's supposed to say.
[02:42:33.333 --> 02:42:34.014]  That's what you do.
[02:42:34.054 --> 02:42:35.315]  You're a prostitute.
[02:42:35.755 --> 02:42:38.437]  You're a intellectual whore.
[02:42:39.622 --> 02:42:41.163]  And a big old ugly one at that.
[02:42:43.765 --> 02:42:44.885]  Oh, you don't like me because I'm a lesbian?
[02:42:44.945 --> 02:42:46.186]  No, that's why I don't like you.
[02:42:46.206 --> 02:42:54.712]  I like you because you're an un-American piece of trash who spews all his calls for violence and then turns around and makes it up about us.
[02:42:55.052 --> 02:42:56.193]  You're a lying pig.
[02:43:00.498 --> 02:43:10.383]  Hey, by now I'm sure that most of you know that there are always big discounts and unbelievable savings on a regular basis at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:43:51.683 --> 02:43:52.823]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:53.103 --> 02:43:53.584]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:43:53.644 --> 02:43:53.784]  Yep!
[02:44:00.859 --> 02:44:02.480]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:05.701]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it.
[02:44:05.781 --> 02:44:06.602]  This is big news.
[02:44:06.702 --> 02:44:10.644]  Former Misfits singer, appearance cancelled after social media review.
[02:44:10.864 --> 02:44:11.624]  Michael Graves.
[02:44:11.965 --> 02:44:17.427]  And this is a big deal, because they said, we reviewed him and it's white supremacy and all this made up crap.
[02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:20.849]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[02:44:20.909 --> 02:44:21.909]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[02:44:21.929 --> 02:44:23.810]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[02:44:24.031 --> 02:44:26.372]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[02:44:26.392 --> 02:44:28.753]  My tour manager is also my guitar player.
[02:44:29.613 --> 02:44:38.756]  And I, we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it.
[02:44:40.177 --> 02:44:50.060]  That they had, like you've said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars.
[02:44:51.167 --> 02:44:54.512]  Uh, from Breitbart, um, on and on.
[02:44:54.992 --> 02:45:02.502]  And it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[02:45:02.522 --> 02:45:04.345]  It was called the War of Information Tour.
[02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:18.895]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars.
[02:45:18.955 --> 02:45:22.417]  And we were disseminating the information and getting the word out.
[02:45:22.897 --> 02:45:24.278]  And no one said, boo.
[02:45:24.698 --> 02:45:27.879]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[02:45:28.439 --> 02:45:30.040]  Now jump to where we are in 2018.
[02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:31.801]  And
[02:45:35.737 --> 02:45:39.461]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[02:45:40.062 --> 02:45:46.750]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:52.557]  And like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people.
[02:45:53.118 --> 02:45:55.761]  And we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that.
[02:45:56.221 --> 02:46:10.351]  You and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression, to hit the barbed wire as well.
[02:46:10.431 --> 02:46:18.397]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there, there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists.
[02:46:19.118 --> 02:46:29.636]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover.
[02:46:31.195 --> 02:46:36.938]  For other artists, other musicians to do this regardless of the consequences.
[02:46:37.218 --> 02:46:43.801]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[02:46:43.901 --> 02:46:49.884]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man and we really appreciate you and I look forward to having you back on.
[02:46:50.744 --> 02:46:51.325]  Alex, thank you.
[02:46:51.405 --> 02:46:55.747]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[02:46:56.107 --> 02:46:56.907]  Alex, thank you.
[02:46:57.087 --> 02:46:57.368]  Thank you.
[02:46:57.388 --> 02:46:57.928]  God bless you.
[02:47:04.036 --> 02:47:06.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.286 --> 02:47:16.988]  Well, we knew it was coming, didn't we?
[02:47:21.933 --> 02:47:28.459]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:31.514 --> 02:47:41.616]  Powerful multinational corporations allied with the Chinese Communists, the unelected EU, the Hollywood scum, publicly are trying to overthrow our country and the rest of the West.
[02:47:41.636 --> 02:47:44.057]  They pretty much destroyed Europe already.
[02:47:45.657 --> 02:47:49.178]  These very same multinationals have sucked the third world dry and incredibly exploited them.
[02:47:49.498 --> 02:47:55.980]  Now they form giant UN refugee centers to brainwash them full of George Soros NGO garbage.
[02:47:57.088 --> 02:47:59.390]  And then point them straight at the United States.
[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:11.099]  When our president says, we're a nation, we have borders, we can't just have tanks totally open, nobody else does, they scream, you're a Nazi, and there's just a wall of that garbage.
[02:48:11.179 --> 02:48:12.600]  I want to go to some of your phone calls.
[02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:17.663]  Then I have a compilation of them calling Trump a Nazi and all this for saying nationalist.
[02:48:19.024 --> 02:48:23.508]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, and here's the one stipulation.
[02:48:23.588 --> 02:48:26.310]  Long-time caller, first-time caller, one stipulation.
[02:48:27.665 --> 02:48:31.327]  Am I right about everything pointing towards false flag with all their pre-programming?
[02:48:31.647 --> 02:48:32.627]  And what comes next?
[02:48:33.708 --> 02:48:40.591]  What do you make of the one mailed to CNN in Brennan having an ISIS flag on it?
[02:48:40.811 --> 02:48:44.373]  That's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:48:44.773 --> 02:48:46.114]  How obvious is all this?
[02:48:46.374 --> 02:48:55.378]  And then Soros' son that runs his Antifa Foundation, who's in the documents calling for violence and training people for it, saying it's all our fault.
[02:48:55.538 --> 02:48:56.659]  The nerve of this guy!
[02:48:57.711 --> 02:48:59.371]  It's so obvious this is for the election.
[02:49:01.292 --> 02:49:04.372]  So again, toll-free number to give me your take.
[02:49:04.512 --> 02:49:04.872]  Agree?
[02:49:04.992 --> 02:49:05.492]  Disagree?
[02:49:05.512 --> 02:49:07.513]  We're not screening your calls, just on this subject.
[02:49:07.553 --> 02:49:11.253]  If it's not, I'm gonna move on to the next person.
[02:49:11.273 --> 02:49:12.314]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[02:49:13.114 --> 02:49:17.435]  Then Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, he's been predicting false flags.
[02:49:17.815 --> 02:49:21.115]  He's gonna be joining us to give us his take, see if he agrees with me or disagrees.
[02:49:21.815 --> 02:49:22.915]  That is all coming up.
[02:49:23.016 --> 02:49:25.476]  So much more coming up on the whole
[02:49:27.239 --> 02:49:36.287]  Illegal alien invasion of a bunch of American flag-burning, foreign flag-waving, calling the President the Antichrist, a Nazi, a bunch of spoiled brats with U.S.
[02:49:36.448 --> 02:49:41.032]  aid bags, now on 18-wheelers, just like we predicted, just like James Wood predicted.
[02:49:41.752 --> 02:49:47.898]  It'd take them, you know, 100 days, going 20 miles a day to get up here.
[02:49:47.958 --> 02:49:50.821]  But no, they'll be here before the election!
[02:49:52.642 --> 02:49:55.103]  Hell, they'll be here in about four or five days at current rate.
[02:49:55.744 --> 02:49:58.225]  And all these other caravans are bum-rushing.
[02:49:58.605 --> 02:49:59.546]  And it's on the news.
[02:49:59.666 --> 02:50:00.487]  The Trucks are ready.
[02:50:03.448 --> 02:50:05.910]  There's another video shot from over the back of the 18-wheeler.
[02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:08.731]  Paul tweeted it, and it shows him waving the Honduran flag.
[02:50:09.111 --> 02:50:09.812]  It shows it all.
[02:50:10.472 --> 02:50:13.034]  Again, it's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:50:13.534 --> 02:50:14.735]  Gateway Pundit has it as well.
[02:50:15.375 --> 02:50:18.677]  And then there's also footage of them with the U.S.
[02:50:19.618 --> 02:50:20.178]  aid bags.
[02:50:20.198 --> 02:50:21.899]  You go, well then, why doesn't Trump cut that?
[02:50:23.148 --> 02:50:32.771]  We give the money to the UN, we fund about 45% of its whole operations, and then they give the money to the tax-free foundations.
[02:50:33.271 --> 02:50:34.672]  Soros doesn't even pay for any of this.
[02:50:35.132 --> 02:50:41.274]  When he calls himself a foundation or a philanthropist, like Bill and Melinda Gates or Warren Buffett, it means they're tax-exempt.
[02:50:43.835 --> 02:50:46.796]  And they get money, and then they say they give it.
[02:50:48.857 --> 02:50:53.919]  Well, you think a slime bag that rounded up thousands of his fellow Jews, he was what they call a bloodhound?
[02:50:54.039 --> 02:50:57.041]  He looked like he was 12, he was 16 when he started.
[02:50:57.341 --> 02:50:59.682]  He'd get down there like a bloodhound and find those Jews.
[02:51:01.522 --> 02:51:03.363]  Reportedly, he howled Hitler quite nicely.
[02:51:04.464 --> 02:51:05.344]  But that's okay!
[02:51:05.364 --> 02:51:09.226]  Because his son looks even more psychotic and evil.
[02:51:10.006 --> 02:51:13.027]  And I take it as a badge of honor and courage to stand against this filth.
[02:51:14.548 --> 02:51:16.569]  And when you support us, and when you pray for us,
[02:51:19.363 --> 02:51:25.466]  The guy put up a hedge of protection around us, and when you buy the products, and when you share the articles, when you share the videos, it changes the world.
[02:51:25.987 --> 02:51:31.030]  Right now, there's a couple articles on Infowars.com that only you can get out.
[02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:32.110]  Newswars.com.
[02:51:33.451 --> 02:51:36.533]  Alex Jones warned of October surprise attacks on media months ago.
[02:51:37.033 --> 02:51:37.973]  Goes for all the specifics.
[02:51:38.574 --> 02:51:39.654]  Has the video clips in it.
[02:51:41.495 --> 02:51:43.076]  Left blames Trump for bomb scare.
[02:51:43.116 --> 02:51:44.657]  Republicans aware of false flag.
[02:51:45.137 --> 02:51:45.878]  Kellen McBrain.
[02:51:48.752 --> 02:51:49.833]  Very important, big article.
[02:51:51.413 --> 02:51:52.194]  It's all there.
[02:51:52.354 --> 02:51:52.594]  U.S.
[02:51:52.654 --> 02:51:57.977]  Army vet lawyer Kurt Scheitler says mail bombs could be left as scam.
[02:51:59.498 --> 02:52:08.503]  And everybody from Governor Cuomo to CNN to the Easter Bunny is getting one so they can all point their finger at us and say we're violent, but they're running around foaming at the mouth.
[02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:37.160]  And so they can legitimize the censorship, and so Alexander Soros, who funds all the antifa and the violence, and his dad funds all these foreign country overthrows and currency collapses, he can sit there and point his finger and say, Donald Trump and the demonization of opponents, when you literally call Trump Hitler, your foundation, and Nazis, and all of us evil, and all this stuff, oh, but we're not allowed to talk back to you because you're Alexander Soros!
[02:52:40.762 --> 02:52:47.505]  Who, like, thinks it's cool that he's got all these supermodels around him that look like anorexic skeksis.
[02:52:48.486 --> 02:52:53.688]  And, like, if he's seen with a bunch of girls everywhere, everybody doesn't know, you know, what's really going on there.
[02:52:53.708 --> 02:52:55.409]  There's nothing wrong with that, Mr. Soros.
[02:52:55.889 --> 02:52:58.571]  But God Almighty, stop trying to act like a big, tough guy.
[02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:02.082]  That's why you have this evil complex like your daddy.
[02:53:02.562 --> 02:53:07.266]  You are a low-level sell-out of your own people, the worst trash.
[02:53:07.666 --> 02:53:13.491]  Your fortune, everything you have, is off the blood of the Jews your father helped murder viciously.
[02:53:18.835 --> 02:53:22.077]  The main obstacle to stable and just world order is the United States.
[02:53:22.778 --> 02:53:26.181]  Changing the attitude and policies of the United States remains my top priority.
[02:53:27.307 --> 02:53:33.471]  And now, since he's kind of the omnibudsman of all this crap, Trump gets up and says, I believe in America.
[02:53:33.531 --> 02:53:34.292]  I love our country.
[02:53:34.692 --> 02:53:37.394]  We're not going to let China have one-sided deals with huge tariffs on us.
[02:53:37.654 --> 02:53:38.895]  We're going to be fair to our country.
[02:53:40.016 --> 02:53:41.577]  And Don Lemon goes, whoa!
[02:53:42.917 --> 02:53:48.081]  Have you ever heard such evil as saying that you care about your country and you have an identity?
[02:53:48.121 --> 02:53:49.082]  You don't have an identity.
[02:53:49.142 --> 02:53:50.583]  It's whatever CNN says.
[02:53:51.223 --> 02:53:55.246]  Like CNN's Chris Cuomo said, we can read WikiLeaks here at CNN.
[02:53:55.646 --> 02:53:56.066]  You can't.
[02:53:56.106 --> 02:53:57.007]  It's illegal if you do.
[02:53:59.744 --> 02:54:04.565]  It's all about training you to take being treated like you're lower than a dead dog.
[02:54:07.066 --> 02:54:09.307]  You're supposed to be scared of George Soros.
[02:54:09.427 --> 02:54:10.787]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[02:54:11.747 --> 02:54:24.171]  Because he heads up, you know, that whole satanic star chamber court they got going over there and their satanic church
[02:54:28.308 --> 02:54:32.089]  You know, Newsflash, George Soros is the opposite of the Sanhedrin, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:36.091]  But he thinks he heads it up.
[02:54:37.051 --> 02:54:38.071]  He's a bad hombre.
[02:54:40.392 --> 02:54:42.233]  When I go up against him, I feel close to God.
[02:54:42.293 --> 02:54:47.474]  It's not just that he gets demonized, you know, he always gets blamed, and he's not really that important baloney.
[02:54:49.435 --> 02:54:50.275]  He's super evil.
[02:54:51.056 --> 02:54:51.756]  He's super bad.
[02:54:53.072 --> 02:54:55.434]  And he thinks he can crush you and your family.
[02:54:55.694 --> 02:54:58.556]  He thinks he's better than you and he hates Christian America.
[02:54:59.196 --> 02:55:00.958]  And he hates our success and our strength.
[02:55:01.638 --> 02:55:02.519]  My God, he's a Nazi!
[02:55:05.521 --> 02:55:06.982]  It was happy time, best time of his life.
[02:55:08.423 --> 02:55:08.903]  In his words.
[02:55:09.944 --> 02:55:14.367]  And he thinks if he can mount your head on the wall, politically, he can be somebody.
[02:55:16.168 --> 02:55:21.632]  You know, he wrote back when he was a young man that he thought he was the Messiah, but he wanted to tell people because they would have locked him up.
[02:55:24.884 --> 02:55:27.285]  From your mouth to God's ears, buddy boy.
[02:55:29.867 --> 02:55:31.167]  From your mouth to God's ears.
[02:55:32.128 --> 02:55:36.230]  I just hope in my life that I'll be well-expended against you and your type.
[02:55:36.250 --> 02:55:41.532]  All right, we're gonna go to break, come back, take calls, get some of these other clips I haven't covered.
[02:55:41.913 --> 02:55:42.753]  This is an epic time.
[02:55:42.793 --> 02:55:44.074]  They're clearly going for broke.
[02:55:45.114 --> 02:55:48.156]  Framing themselves as the victims, framing themselves as under attack.
[02:55:49.777 --> 02:55:54.179]  Framing themselves while they push for the violence and the conflagration and the violence in the streets.
[02:55:55.179 --> 02:55:57.300]  This is a provocation for their antifa to get more vicious?
[02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:03.804]  Their antifa that pledges to go to conservatives' homes and talk show host homes and Republicans' homes and members of Congress' homes and kill them?
[02:56:05.545 --> 02:56:11.709]  And my great Cardinal Sin was saying, if you're on the list they want to kill, be ready and fight them back when they try to kill you.
[02:56:12.370 --> 02:56:14.691]  You're not supposed to do that when they send antifa to kill you.
[02:56:15.291 --> 02:56:17.573]  You're supposed to roll over and show your neck to them.
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:32.323]  So when that spiritually devoid, empty husk of a minion, directed by someone even more soulless, comes to kill you, you protect yourself.
[02:56:32.403 --> 02:56:34.163]  That's the cardinal sin to the left.
[02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:39.665]  That's why they like to be child molesters, and why they like to hurt children, because they can feel powerful over them.
[02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:46.966]  And another thing you can do to crush the enemy and get great products in your life is InfoWarstore.com.

[02:57:33.388 --> 02:57:37.510]  You have allowed us to stand like a lighthouse out on a promontory against the storm.
[02:57:38.510 --> 02:57:47.854]  And you will decide whether we're destroyed or not, but in the end, all that matters is that our children go forth into the future free of the vampire succubus that is the New World Order.
[02:57:50.137 --> 02:57:56.141]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:57:56.502 --> 02:57:59.124]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:57:59.724 --> 02:58:03.187]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:58:03.427 --> 02:58:07.690]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:58:08.130 --> 02:58:11.393]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:58:12.293 --> 02:58:22.519]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:58:23.279 --> 02:58:31.824]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:58:33.465 --> 02:58:41.994]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:58:50.223 --> 02:58:58.452]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:58:58.633 --> 02:58:59.894]  Believe me, I know.
[02:59:00.114 --> 02:59:04.439]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:59:04.859 --> 02:59:07.923]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:59:08.403 --> 02:59:09.864]  I still have that energy.
[02:59:10.084 --> 02:59:30.331]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:59:30.831 --> 02:59:34.594]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:59:34.614 --> 02:59:38.277]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:59:38.537 --> 02:59:43.061]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:59:43.581 --> 02:59:45.602]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:59:46.303 --> 02:59:49.325]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:51.727 --> 02:59:57.612]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.733 --> 03:00:09.295]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:09.576 --> 03:00:13.758]  It's Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:13.838 --> 03:00:19.921]  I covered the reports earlier from a lot of different research groups that looks like a big Republican wave.
[03:00:20.141 --> 03:00:21.822]  Really high turnout compared to Democrats.
[03:00:24.864 --> 03:00:27.405]  Because they metaphysically can't do anything real.
[03:00:28.712 --> 03:00:29.092]  I don't think so.
[03:00:47.694 --> 03:00:51.977]  They've done all the pre-preparation that Trump and Alex Jones are violent.
[03:00:52.538 --> 03:00:54.419]  And now they're blaming Trump and the Liberty Movement.
[03:00:54.779 --> 03:00:59.803]  And Alexander Soros is saying conservatives' rhetoric is to blame for these pipe bombs that none of them went off.
[03:01:00.244 --> 03:01:01.204]  Which I find very interesting.
[03:01:01.224 --> 03:01:01.945]  I'm glad they didn't.
[03:01:03.066 --> 03:01:04.647]  And just none of them went off.
[03:01:05.928 --> 03:01:08.490]  But all these liberals got mailed them, so now they're all portable victims.
[03:01:09.871 --> 03:01:11.052]  It really never ends.
[03:01:11.132 --> 03:01:13.454]  How sociopaths try to mimic real feelings.
[03:01:15.253 --> 03:01:17.814]  How'd you like him to babysit your kids, old Alexander Soros?
[03:01:18.714 --> 03:01:20.515]  Oh, Uncle Al's coming over.
[03:01:21.315 --> 03:01:24.776]  Every photo, just totally like a great white shark, those eyes.
[03:01:25.636 --> 03:01:26.776]  As dead as doornails.
[03:01:27.497 --> 03:01:27.937]  Politically.
[03:01:28.417 --> 03:01:28.877]  Spiritually.
[03:01:29.937 --> 03:01:31.318]  We wish no harm against any of these people.
[03:01:31.338 --> 03:01:32.298]  That turns them into martyrs.
[03:01:32.318 --> 03:01:35.799]  We want to stay as far away from Mr. Soros.
[03:01:36.279 --> 03:01:38.120]  And if America's so bad, we wish they'd leave.
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:38.960]  Just please go.
[03:01:40.711 --> 03:01:41.311]  But I guess.
[03:01:42.111 --> 03:01:44.172]  Rounding up fellow Jews over in Europe.
[03:01:44.672 --> 03:01:45.392]  Folks don't lie.
[03:01:45.592 --> 03:01:46.033]  That's right.
[03:01:46.513 --> 03:01:49.134]  You guys are banned over in Europe for killing all those Jews.
[03:01:49.154 --> 03:01:49.574]  Your dad.
[03:01:49.594 --> 03:01:51.074]  Oh, that's right.
[03:01:51.094 --> 03:01:51.754]  I forgot about that.
[03:01:53.175 --> 03:01:55.495]  Let's go to Chris in Illinois.
[03:01:55.515 --> 03:01:56.676]  Chris, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:58.516 --> 03:01:59.077]  Morning, Alex.
[03:01:59.577 --> 03:01:59.877]  Welcome.
[03:02:00.077 --> 03:02:09.180]  So the mainstream media, their hubris with this is kind of working to our advantage because their own echo chamber
[03:02:12.081 --> 03:02:15.242]  They don't really understand fully that we kind of have this figured out.
[03:02:15.942 --> 03:02:22.804]  I look at these comments on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and I see the word false flag more than I ever have.
[03:02:23.625 --> 03:02:33.648]  So the fact that InfoWars, among many other people, have introduced that word into the modern nomenclature, I think a lot of people just aren't buying it.
[03:02:34.168 --> 03:02:34.948]  I mean, that's kind of what
[03:02:35.592 --> 03:02:36.392]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:02:36.512 --> 03:02:38.293]  They're like generals that lost the last war.
[03:02:38.333 --> 03:02:44.876]  They're like trying to fight victories we had ten years ago, five years ago, two years ago, and all of us are just moving forward into the future.
[03:02:46.557 --> 03:02:46.777]  Correct.
[03:02:46.997 --> 03:02:52.139]  Hey, what do you make of, uh, so, I'm looking at this, it says, return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[03:02:52.159 --> 03:02:52.740]  Did you see that?
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:54.941]  Or did you, you might have covered that already.
[03:02:56.782 --> 03:02:58.742]  I've seen a bunch of photos of the supposed bombs.
[03:02:58.762 --> 03:02:59.443]  Tell me what you're seeing.
[03:03:00.783 --> 03:03:04.425]  Well, evidently, I'm seeing that CNN, I think, reported that
[03:03:05.953 --> 03:03:15.375]  Two of the bombs, there was a return address put on there and it was, the return address was actually Debbie Walterman Schultz's office in Florida, I believe.
[03:03:16.155 --> 03:03:17.295]  I would have to double check this.
[03:03:17.335 --> 03:03:18.556]  I just saw it a few minutes ago.
[03:03:18.576 --> 03:03:23.957]  Sure, I think the joke is like you mail it to her and even if she doesn't get it, it goes back to the other office.
[03:03:24.397 --> 03:03:24.917]  Oh, okay.
[03:03:25.577 --> 03:03:30.698]  But if you expand on that, what do you make of this one where, the one that was sent to Brennan,
[03:03:32.737 --> 03:03:35.238]  And it's got an ISIS flag with a picture of Brennan on it.
[03:03:35.598 --> 03:03:39.259]  I think that's they're going to say, oh, the right winger was mad that he supposedly was part of ISIS.
[03:03:39.759 --> 03:03:40.940]  And so that's why that's on there.
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:43.521]  I mean, I think people think, oh, that shows it's ISIS.
[03:03:43.561 --> 03:03:48.842]  No, I think that's showing they're trying to set right wingers up because all the pre-programming for this is just too perfect.
[03:03:49.542 --> 03:03:49.923]  Well, right.
[03:03:49.963 --> 03:03:57.585]  And then also the fact that if it is a return address of that, they could also use it to spin it to be like, well, they figured out it was a false flag.
[03:03:57.685 --> 03:04:00.266]  So they put her address on there just to
[03:04:01.038 --> 03:04:02.658]  You know, like you said, Senator, anyway.
[03:04:03.058 --> 03:04:10.020]  But, you know, the fact that you, you know, what's working, what I see is working is simple wars.
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:14.021]  You know, you don't react to what happens.
[03:04:14.441 --> 03:04:18.602]  The fact that you're out ahead of this and report on it before it happens, you know, tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:18.622 --> 03:04:21.583]  I mean, I think you should get like a stock market ticker.
[03:04:22.076 --> 03:04:22.396]  I think so.
[03:04:45.729 --> 03:04:51.053]  And that's why they wanted our YouTube channel down with billions of views, is why they want us off air, because now the credibility went straight up.
[03:04:51.474 --> 03:04:53.375]  We won the election, so they've got to discredit that.
[03:04:53.395 --> 03:04:54.016]  You're absolutely right.
[03:04:54.376 --> 03:04:55.117]  Great call, Chris.
[03:04:55.137 --> 03:04:55.677]  God bless you.
[03:04:57.719 --> 03:04:58.139]  We'll be back.
[03:05:01.528 --> 03:05:04.549]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[03:05:04.609 --> 03:05:05.089]  Go ahead.
[03:05:05.309 --> 03:05:10.910]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:12.190]  I'd done The War Room.
[03:05:12.490 --> 03:05:14.950]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:16.531]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:05:16.571 --> 03:05:17.211]  I was exhausted.
[03:05:17.511 --> 03:05:20.812]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[03:05:21.132 --> 03:05:25.772]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[03:05:25.852 --> 03:05:27.873]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:05:27.933 --> 03:05:28.673]  The same thing.
[03:05:28.933 --> 03:05:30.694]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[03:05:30.794 --> 03:05:32.015]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:05:32.195 --> 03:05:34.036]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:05:34.297 --> 03:05:40.301]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:05:40.361 --> 03:05:41.441]  You can sleep with it.
[03:05:41.742 --> 03:05:46.044]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:05:46.104 --> 03:05:48.906]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:05:49.066 --> 03:05:50.768]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:05:50.888 --> 03:05:51.588]  It really works.
[03:05:51.808 --> 03:05:56.391]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[03:05:56.772 --> 03:05:58.913]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[03:06:14.426 --> 03:06:15.187]  Big Brother.
[03:06:15.547 --> 03:06:16.808]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:17.368 --> 03:06:18.469]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:20.711]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:20.951 --> 03:06:22.112]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:22.593 --> 03:06:27.257]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.862 --> 03:06:33.463]  I don't know if it's going to be truck bombs or machine gun attacks.
[03:06:33.483 --> 03:06:34.143]  I don't know what it is.
[03:06:34.183 --> 03:06:36.524]  They're getting ready to blow the living snot out of themselves.
[03:06:37.904 --> 03:06:41.865]  And when it happens, I won't be on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, but you will be.
[03:06:41.926 --> 03:06:43.606]  You've got to get out there and cover it all.
[03:06:43.866 --> 03:06:47.567]  That's why they said, oh my God, he said Sandy Hook didn't happen, which I did question.
[03:06:47.787 --> 03:06:50.408]  Then they said, I said Parkland didn't happen, which I did not question.
[03:06:50.768 --> 03:06:51.889]  Because we knew it was police stand down.
[03:06:52.409 --> 03:06:55.330]  Because they want it where I'm not listened to when they pull this.
[03:06:57.210 --> 03:06:58.951]  Because they're going to blame Alex Jones.
[03:07:00.143 --> 03:07:02.231]  Alex E. Jones and DJ D.
[03:07:07.832 --> 03:07:08.532]  It's confirmed.
[03:07:08.632 --> 03:07:10.853]  The left is activating their sleeper cells.
[03:07:10.893 --> 03:07:16.374]  They are preparing to stage terror attacks in the next 26 days, and it's only meant to escalate from there.
[03:07:16.994 --> 03:07:19.215]  The globalists don't even care if they win the midterms.
[03:07:19.315 --> 03:07:32.138]  They want to create a national emergency to try to drive Trump and the patriots out of the government, because they know that we're bringing the country back, and the prosperity is the ultimate trump card against the globalists.
[03:07:32.458 --> 03:07:34.419]  So they are now about to make their move.
[03:07:34.719 --> 03:07:35.439]  But thank God.
[03:07:35.959 --> 03:07:42.622]  Trump and the patriots that we do have in the government are aware of this and are stopping these terror attacks before they take place.
[03:07:43.083 --> 03:07:45.304]  The only question is, can we stop them all?
[03:07:45.584 --> 03:07:47.065]  This guy is the classic cutout.
[03:07:47.085 --> 03:07:48.325]  I've done a lot of research on him.
[03:07:48.746 --> 03:07:50.406]  Classic cutout decoy.
[03:07:51.767 --> 03:07:58.311]  A mental patient who they would have out there with a bomb, who they would then load up with pro-Trump paraphernalia, you name it.
[03:07:58.951 --> 03:08:00.512]  There's a lot of different angles they could go with.
[03:08:02.179 --> 03:08:04.040]  The globalists tell you how they even do this.
[03:08:04.701 --> 03:08:10.365]  Remember the movie Arlington Road, where they trick the professor to think he's going to stop the terror attack, but then he actually gets blamed for it?
[03:08:10.405 --> 03:08:12.727]  That's exactly what they did with McVeigh.
[03:08:13.128 --> 03:08:16.210]  He was there trying to go around setting up militias to stop terror attacks.
[03:08:16.750 --> 03:08:23.436]  When they said they were going to go ahead and create a real one, he blew the whistle, tried to stop it, they drugged him up, and the rest is history, and it all came out in court.
[03:08:23.656 --> 03:08:24.557]  But that's a side issue.
[03:08:25.595 --> 03:08:26.315]  Let me go over this article.
[03:08:26.335 --> 03:08:30.957]  All right, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, best-selling author, normally hosts this hour.
[03:08:30.977 --> 03:08:32.577]  I'm going to ride shotgun a little bit.
[03:08:32.637 --> 03:08:37.559]  I promise I'm going to at least take 10 calls or so with him and then let him take over.
[03:08:37.879 --> 03:08:39.420]  He's welcome to come on the war room after that.
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:41.040]  We're going to have open phones the whole war room.
[03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:48.283]  And then tonight I'm going to be hosting, I already was, 8 to 10 tonight with the latest on this and the reason this is such a big deal.
[03:08:49.506 --> 03:09:10.917]  Is you've got dozens of scares, the police saying at least six places have gotten pipe bombs, and you've got Alexander Soros blaming Trump, blaming our rhetoric, you've got the media all saying that the media is going to be attacked because of myself and others and the president when they're the ones calling for violence.
[03:09:11.017 --> 03:09:14.879]  I really see this 13 days out as I predicted
[03:09:16.474 --> 03:09:25.856]  As a test balloon to frame the left and their leadership as victims, whether it's Governor Cuomo or whether it's John Brennan.
[03:09:25.876 --> 03:09:31.657]  People are asking, well, why did this pipe bomb get mailed to John Brennan with an ISIS flag on it at CNN?
[03:09:31.697 --> 03:09:39.478]  Well, he works at MSNBC, but he's on CNN all the time because they're going to say, well, he thought Brennan was with ISIS, so some right winger did it.
[03:09:39.919 --> 03:09:41.539]  I believe they've already got their patsy.
[03:09:42.279 --> 03:09:47.287]  And leftist elements of the FBI are famous for creating provocateurs or patsies.
[03:09:47.627 --> 03:09:54.477]  I think it's too early to tell on every front, but the timing, the history, the pre-programming of every channel in the country.
[03:09:55.589 --> 03:10:00.192]  Don't say that I said use battle rifles on the media and that Trump's trying to get the media killed.
[03:10:00.612 --> 03:10:02.213]  They've introduced that massively.
[03:10:02.773 --> 03:10:06.616]  And our own Matt Bracken has predicted that this would happen just weeks out from the election.
[03:10:07.116 --> 03:10:11.079]  Now he may throw a curveball at me and say he thinks it's something else, but he'll be able to elaborate a lot more.
[03:10:11.099 --> 03:10:12.840]  We're going to call soon, in a few minutes, but I can't wait.
[03:10:12.860 --> 03:10:13.860]  I want to hear what you have to say now.
[03:10:14.281 --> 03:10:15.561]  And you'll ride shotgun with us, Matt.
[03:10:16.462 --> 03:10:20.985]  Looking at this, just a few hours into this, you know, eight, nine hours into this, what do you think's really going on?
[03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:32.238]  This is a really fascinating case because, you know, studying these things, going to the Unabomber and far back beyond that, these are obviously hoax bombs.
[03:10:32.298 --> 03:10:34.580]  They're just meant to be reported as bombs.
[03:10:35.401 --> 03:10:39.084]  I don't think any of these are viable or capable of making any kind of an explosion.
[03:10:39.724 --> 03:10:45.509]  They might as well have taken red road flares, you know, wrapped them with black electrical tape and put batteries on it.
[03:10:46.068 --> 03:10:47.849]  With wires hanging all over the place.
[03:10:48.369 --> 03:10:50.991]  They're kind of Wile E. Coyote looking bombs to me.
[03:10:51.751 --> 03:10:54.993]  And the purpose of them was just to get this media play.
[03:10:55.693 --> 03:10:57.714]  What's interesting, a couple of things.
[03:10:57.774 --> 03:11:00.215]  There's no post marks over the stamps.
[03:11:00.915 --> 03:11:03.037]  These weren't taken to a postal facility.
[03:11:04.077 --> 03:11:10.160]  Everybody that goes into a postal facility is photographed at the point of handing over the package.
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:13.762]  And so they also wanted this to stand out as soon as it got there.
[03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:25.722]  Yeah, and if these were not delivered and they all arrived in the same time frame, like the same, you know, 12 or 24 hours, including one delivered to George Soros' estate, apparently.
[03:11:26.209 --> 03:11:31.474]  It's hard to believe he doesn't have video for like a mile around that portal.
[03:11:32.034 --> 03:11:39.161]  But the fact that these all arrived at the same times without going through the mail, it tells me that there's a cell.
[03:11:39.601 --> 03:11:43.185]  That there's actually a group of people delivering these as a time on target thing.
[03:11:43.585 --> 03:11:49.711]  Well that's what I was going to say early, is that you've got so many of these sent in simultaneously, that shows a group.
[03:11:51.195 --> 03:11:56.118]  Yeah, and I'm guessing that this is going to come out to be some kind of an antifa offshoot.
[03:11:56.598 --> 03:12:06.444]  You know, the students for a democratic society led to the weather underground when they got frustrated with the slow pace and lack of action, as they saw it.
[03:12:07.245 --> 03:12:15.410]  When these antifas get beat up by the Proud Boys, they're not just going to go home and re-evaluate their attitudes.
[03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:19.713]  They're going to say, look, obviously we can't engage in fistfights.
[03:12:20.407 --> 03:12:21.647]  We're going to lose.
[03:12:21.667 --> 03:12:29.449]  Oh, you're saying Antifa would be the group that would pull a false flag to demonize Trump and the Patriots, and as the underlings, they would carry it out.
[03:12:29.689 --> 03:12:30.869]  Then it's plausible to liability.
[03:12:31.089 --> 03:12:33.090]  And who's their main funder in the documents?
[03:12:33.130 --> 03:12:33.690]  Please pull it up.
[03:12:33.870 --> 03:12:36.010]  Alexander Soros is the main funder.
[03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:38.451]  Print me that article again with the documents from January of this year.
[03:12:38.911 --> 03:12:44.532]  Documents show Antifa planned to trigger civil unrest to bring in martial law for Obama.
[03:12:44.872 --> 03:12:48.593]  If you're saying it's Antifa, they are literally the main henchmen of Soros.
[03:12:50.219 --> 03:13:02.431]  Yeah, and this is going to turn out, I think, to be kind of a group of goofballs that are, you know, just like the nooses in colleges or the swastikas painted on churches or synagogues.
[03:13:03.252 --> 03:13:04.754]  It's usually a false flag.
[03:13:04.794 --> 03:13:09.058]  It's usually done by the so-called victim, you know, to blame their enemies.
[03:13:09.781 --> 03:13:29.494]  And I think that after the Kavanaugh fiasco and the Elizabeth Warren DNA fiasco, and now the caravan that looks like it's only going to lead to more Republican support, I think that they had to change the narrative quickly to right-wing bombers.
[03:13:30.214 --> 03:13:32.996]  But they didn't have... These aren't real bombers.
[03:13:33.016 --> 03:13:35.438]  I don't think these are viable bombs in any way.
[03:13:36.358 --> 03:13:38.440]  This is strictly a media campaign.
[03:13:38.908 --> 03:13:40.028]  To change the narrative.
[03:13:40.529 --> 03:13:43.429]  And I think the ATF and the FBI are going to wrap this up quickly.
[03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:51.472]  And unlike the Deep State coup, which was run out of Washington main headquarters, this is going to be done by field offices.
[03:13:52.072 --> 03:13:57.314]  And the ATF and the FBI guys out in the field offices, this is what they do.
[03:13:58.394 --> 03:14:01.775]  They are professionals at forensic analysis.
[03:14:02.589 --> 03:14:07.554]  And I think they're going to have these knuckleheads brought to heel in just a few days.
[03:14:08.154 --> 03:14:09.716]  Are you getting that from sources?
[03:14:09.776 --> 03:14:12.498]  Because you've been right way more than you've been wrong.
[03:14:12.518 --> 03:14:13.399]  You're right almost always.
[03:14:13.659 --> 03:14:15.141]  And now that you say it, it makes perfect sense.
[03:14:15.501 --> 03:14:20.545]  Alexander Soros, who just showed the documents printed for me, literally runs Antifa Nationwide.
[03:14:20.565 --> 03:14:21.767]  He pays for the full-page ads.
[03:14:22.187 --> 03:14:23.368]  He has the action group.
[03:14:24.589 --> 03:14:25.710]  They have his signs everywhere.
[03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:26.911]  He coordinates them.
[03:14:27.271 --> 03:14:28.513]  It's his name on the paperwork.
[03:14:29.313 --> 03:14:30.814]  He's about to be the heir to the whole fortune.
[03:14:31.415 --> 03:14:34.437]  And now he's the guy blaming Trump, blaming right-wingers.
[03:14:34.777 --> 03:14:36.539]  He's the first house that gets it.
[03:14:37.079 --> 03:14:39.181]  I mean, this looks incredibly obvious to me.
[03:14:40.182 --> 03:14:47.647]  Yeah, you've got offshoot groups already like Redneck Revolt that take pictures with, you know, with guns of them doing shooting training.
[03:14:48.968 --> 03:14:58.856]  So, you know, this, I think, though, because it's not shooting, it's probably going to turn out to be some, you know, pink hat wearing cat ladies, you know, that
[03:14:59.244 --> 03:15:12.408]  That thought they could disguise themselves, walk into CNN, you know, wearing a big big sunglasses and a goofy hat, drop a package on a desk in like the morning rush and just sort of shift their way out.
[03:15:12.888 --> 03:15:25.992]  But when they when they zoom in on that film footage and then they go out on the street and they follow that film footage backwards to see that cat lady in the goofy hat with the big sunglasses get out of an Uber.
[03:15:26.636 --> 03:15:31.258]  They're going to catch one of these guys, and then they're going to squeal on everybody else.
[03:15:31.318 --> 03:15:34.740]  And I think that the odds are they'll wrap this thing up in a couple of days.
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:38.001]  And Antifa will say, we didn't know these guys.
[03:15:38.081 --> 03:15:44.104]  But of course, they'll turn out to have been affiliated with Antifa or friends of Antifa.
[03:15:44.504 --> 03:15:46.285]  Antifa will say there's no connection.
[03:15:46.645 --> 03:15:50.007]  But we'll all know that they really are Antifa.
[03:15:50.067 --> 03:15:51.188]  That is amazing.
[03:15:51.408 --> 03:15:51.608]  Wow.
[03:15:52.168 --> 03:15:55.691]  Because it is Antifa on the left that are always false flagging themselves with racist stuff.
[03:15:56.051 --> 03:15:58.093]  This would just be the next level to graduate.
[03:16:00.014 --> 03:16:06.299]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[03:16:06.359 --> 03:16:07.460]  They know how the world really works.
[03:16:08.281 --> 03:16:10.783]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[03:16:10.843 --> 03:16:12.084]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[03:16:12.664 --> 03:16:19.490]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around not knowing what they're really doing.
[03:16:20.657 --> 03:16:21.580]  But Infowars!
[03:16:22.382 --> 03:16:28.018]  Now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[03:16:29.022 --> 03:16:33.703]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[03:16:33.983 --> 03:16:37.804]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bi-monthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[03:16:38.464 --> 03:16:44.266]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[03:16:44.306 --> 03:16:47.526]  So I know their larger game plan.
[03:16:47.646 --> 03:16:50.107]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[03:16:50.527 --> 03:16:52.767]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[03:16:53.408 --> 03:16:54.528]  Now you've seen massive
[03:16:55.268 --> 03:17:03.234]  Corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[03:17:03.935 --> 03:17:08.719]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel mafia operation.
[03:17:08.779 --> 03:17:13.002]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[03:17:15.524 --> 03:17:28.868]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[03:17:29.448 --> 03:17:33.650]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[03:17:34.770 --> 03:17:40.252]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[03:17:40.532 --> 03:17:41.612]  Black Friday's coming early.
[03:17:42.515 --> 03:17:43.675]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[03:17:43.835 --> 03:17:48.157]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[03:17:48.737 --> 03:17:54.139]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[03:17:54.959 --> 03:18:02.461]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[03:18:03.341 --> 03:18:05.482]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:18:06.698 --> 03:18:16.683]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[03:18:17.104 --> 03:18:21.806]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[03:18:22.306 --> 03:18:25.448]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[03:18:26.108 --> 03:18:31.071]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWars4.com to even have credit card processing.

[03:19:25.389 --> 03:19:28.291]  They want to shut down because we're successful when we expose them.

[03:20:11.752 --> 03:20:12.352]  Another world.
[03:20:12.392 --> 03:20:12.832]  Another time.
[03:20:12.892 --> 03:20:13.932]  In the age of wonder.
[03:20:36.034 --> 03:20:43.879]  We're going to your phone calls here in a minute, and then Matt's going to take over.
[03:20:43.919 --> 03:20:49.243]  I'll be back tonight, 8 to 10 p.m., with election coverage, all of it, key intel.
[03:20:59.930 --> 03:21:06.353]  And you're the folks that can spread the word about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:21:07.634 --> 03:21:12.636]  The Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, really smart counterterrorism expert.
[03:21:12.656 --> 03:21:14.077]  He's made so many accurate predictions.
[03:21:15.217 --> 03:21:28.964]  Boil down what you were telling me off-air, because it's amazing, of the scripting, the timing, the media, the pre-planning, and then the different fingerprints and telltale signs that a trained expert like you sees right away.
[03:21:30.632 --> 03:21:39.258]  Yeah, I don't I don't think that this is something where we're going to ever look for, you know, emails or messages from George Soros Jr.
[03:21:39.739 --> 03:21:41.460]  to some Antifa operatives.
[03:21:42.020 --> 03:21:51.467]  I think that the communications works more like a beehive with pheromones and temperatures where the panic sets in because Kavanaugh blew up
[03:21:52.268 --> 03:21:54.669]  The Elizabeth Warren DNA became a fiasco.
[03:21:55.129 --> 03:22:02.311]  The immigrant caravan slash invasion is looking terrible and going to drive Republicans to the polls.
[03:22:02.891 --> 03:22:08.032]  And I think that a panic sets in at the DNC that they have to do something.
[03:22:08.673 --> 03:22:20.696]  And this, we need to do something to change the narrative, that panic filters down level by level until you get actual operatives that are like the ones that are saying, we have to do something.
[03:22:21.317 --> 03:22:25.138]  And I think this is going to turn out to be, you know, the Antifa cat ladies.
[03:22:25.638 --> 03:22:29.478]  They wear black like they're little ninjas when they're not wearing their pink hats.
[03:22:30.559 --> 03:22:39.580]  But the fact that these are going to prove, I think, to be non-lethal hoax bombs, strictly made to generate a narrative in the media.
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:49.302]  I think that the fact that they were disseminated widely over a geographical area, but in a short time frame, yet without postmarks on the stamps.
[03:22:49.895 --> 03:22:52.336]  This means it's going to be easy for the FBI to crack.
[03:22:52.676 --> 03:22:58.738]  Now, we ping on the FBI all the time, you know, rightfully so, but mainly FBI headquarters.
[03:22:59.218 --> 03:23:05.460]  Out in the field offices, believe it or not, there are really great, fantastic FBI agents.
[03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:08.381]  They're patriots like anybody in the military or anywhere else.
[03:23:08.921 --> 03:23:10.441]  And this is what they do for a living.
[03:23:10.482 --> 03:23:11.742]  They crack nuts like this.
[03:23:12.322 --> 03:23:17.744]  And when people think they can walk into CNN headquarters, for example, or up to George Soros' house,
[03:23:18.664 --> 03:23:18.944]  I don't
[03:23:36.361 --> 03:23:49.934]  All of the hours at CNN headquarters, they're going to find the suspicious person near the package, and they're going to then go out to the street and see the same person probably taking off their hat and sunglasses, and then getting into an Uber down the block around the corner.
[03:23:50.214 --> 03:23:54.237]  Sure, and that's what you mentioned boiled down earlier, but the part you said off-air was also really key.
[03:23:55.310 --> 03:24:00.776]  That just the fact that the bombs really aren't real, they all look the same, a centralized person, then it's delivered out.
[03:24:01.196 --> 03:24:03.058]  I mean, this just smells of desperation.
[03:24:03.258 --> 03:24:08.263]  Because you see the left saying, Donald Trump and Alex Jones are going to get us attacked, and we're not calling for that.
[03:24:08.804 --> 03:24:12.047]  So clearly that message goes out, make the media the victim.
[03:24:14.140 --> 03:24:18.324]  And all they needed was was hoax bombs, something that looked plausible.
[03:24:19.125 --> 03:24:22.087]  If this was a real bomb campaign, some of them would have gone off.
[03:24:22.467 --> 03:24:24.149]  I mean, there's no question about it.
[03:24:24.529 --> 03:24:26.771]  Or at least they'd be saying these were viable.
[03:24:27.131 --> 03:24:29.033]  I don't think these are viable bombs at all.
[03:24:29.393 --> 03:24:30.955]  These are just made for the media.
[03:24:31.335 --> 03:24:39.302]  And I think that the fact that it was distributed widely means more than one person, probably a small cell, using vehicles and
[03:24:39.989 --> 03:24:42.893]  Vehicles now are filmed on highways and everywhere else.
[03:24:48.925 --> 03:24:54.369]  A guy bombing people in Austin who was real, and people were getting blown up who weren't even, you know, the main target.
[03:24:54.729 --> 03:24:55.990]  Real bombs go off easy.
[03:24:56.010 --> 03:25:00.573]  You got a whole bunch of bombs sent off, none of them hit their target, none of them detonated by accident.
[03:25:00.953 --> 03:25:03.095]  That lends to why you think they're hoax bombs.
[03:25:03.355 --> 03:25:13.082]  Because I know, you know, as a bomb expert, and somebody that studied that, what is it you see about these little bitty bombs, or supposed bombs, that make you think they're inanimate or dummy?
[03:25:15.205 --> 03:25:26.199]  Well, the fact that they were made to look like they came from the post office, as far as the Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address, that makes it... Oh, I get it.
[03:25:26.239 --> 03:25:28.522]  You're saying that shows the incredible amateurness of it.
[03:25:32.270 --> 03:25:37.552]  Well, on one level, amateurness, but in an amateur thinking, you've got to do second, third level thinking.
[03:25:37.812 --> 03:25:39.152]  You have to think like an amateur.
[03:25:39.452 --> 03:25:43.134]  How do you get somebody at CNN to think that something's legit?
[03:25:43.594 --> 03:25:46.135]  Have a known DNC return address.
[03:25:46.415 --> 03:25:49.156]  Oh, some literature from Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[03:25:49.716 --> 03:25:52.837]  Boy, but it sure feels like a little hard rock in the middle of here.
[03:25:53.297 --> 03:25:55.258]  You know, it's not exactly like a
[03:25:56.318 --> 03:25:57.459]  We're good to go.
[03:26:08.493 --> 03:26:08.553]  As
[03:26:28.962 --> 03:26:35.368]  You know, the guys that are at the field offices that have to bear up with all the struck and... No, I understand.
[03:26:35.488 --> 03:26:36.889]  It's all compartmentalized.
[03:26:36.929 --> 03:26:37.590]  There's different groups.
[03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:38.391]  I understand that.
[03:26:38.731 --> 03:26:41.934]  Well, clearly the motive there... At the field office level, they want to crack cases.
[03:26:42.314 --> 03:26:42.635]  Well, sure.
[03:26:43.652 --> 03:26:50.215]  But at the next level, they've been pre-programming that terror attacks are coming against the left to blame Trump.
[03:26:50.755 --> 03:26:53.056]  It's so obvious the timing is what I'm saying.
[03:26:53.356 --> 03:26:56.097]  I mean, no one's calling for violence against liberals that I know of.
[03:26:56.617 --> 03:26:58.338]  And then meanwhile, they just keep saying we are.
[03:26:58.458 --> 03:27:00.799]  And now this appears 13 days out.
[03:27:01.159 --> 03:27:04.760]  Soros is the first target because, you know, they know he's their main benefactor.
[03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:05.260]  I agree.
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:12.083]  He probably and Alex Soros probably don't even know, you know, Alex Soros is in documents, you know, calling for violence and funding it.
[03:27:12.563 --> 03:27:12.903]  I don't
[03:27:27.944 --> 03:27:36.451]  At the field office level, everything is done to protect everyone's reputation is done with messages that are official and time stamped.
[03:27:36.931 --> 03:27:49.621]  Whereas the deep state coup run out of FBI headquarters was done by the quote-unquote small group, half dozen guys at state, half dozen guys at DOJ, half dozen guys in FBI.
[03:27:49.781 --> 03:27:55.245]  When this case, which has elements in multiple states, is being cracked,
[03:27:55.643 --> 03:28:02.606]  There's a task force assembled for this hoax bomb plot, and now you've got field offices in three or four states.
[03:28:03.126 --> 03:28:06.867]  Everything that they send to one another is date-time stamped.
[03:28:07.267 --> 03:28:11.129]  They can't goof this up or spoof it or take it over or hijack it.
[03:28:11.149 --> 03:28:19.652]  Sure, so your theory is correct, which I think has a lot of validity, because the Antifa is the foot soldiers of the Democratic Party, and if you're right, they're going to get busted very, very quickly.
[03:28:20.162 --> 03:28:30.730]  They're going to get busted because as much as some deep state operatives inside of the top floors of the FBI would like to pin this on the right wing, it's not going to be possible.
[03:28:31.030 --> 03:28:40.638]  Number one, these FBI assistants, special agents in charge and so forth, putting a, cracking a case like this on their belt,
[03:28:41.318 --> 03:28:45.780]  Well, you heard Trump say, we're going to get to the bottom of this.
[03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:46.320]  I promise.
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:47.781]  Three minutes, we're going to write your calls.
[03:28:47.821 --> 03:28:48.781]  Matt Bragg is our guest.
[03:28:49.161 --> 03:28:49.842]  He's on fire.
[03:28:49.882 --> 03:28:51.302]  We're back tonight, 8 to 10 p.m.
[03:28:51.322 --> 03:28:54.063]  with election coverage, only at InfoWars.com.
[03:28:54.363 --> 03:28:56.744]  More slash show and some TV and radio stations are picking it up.
[03:28:57.024 --> 03:28:57.965]  We're very excited about that.
[03:29:00.256 --> 03:29:07.000]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.
[03:29:07.740 --> 03:29:16.385]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[03:29:16.985 --> 03:29:26.050]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:29:26.997 --> 03:29:37.862]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[03:29:38.443 --> 03:29:47.527]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[03:29:47.987 --> 03:29:50.331]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[03:29:50.732 --> 03:29:54.137]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[03:29:54.438 --> 03:29:56.581]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:02.563 --> 03:30:04.724]  I'm a government auditor, right?
[03:30:04.764 --> 03:30:06.445]  So I work for the Government Accountability Office.
[03:30:06.885 --> 03:30:12.467]  That is Natalijan Subramanian, an auditor for the Government Accountability Office.
[03:30:13.067 --> 03:30:22.451]  The GAO, as it's called, is supposed to be an independent, non-partisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars.
[03:30:22.911 --> 03:30:31.134]  Subramanian is also an avowed communist and a committed member of DSA, the Democratic Socialists of America.
[03:30:31.766 --> 03:30:36.269]  We have a bunch of just, like, communist, you know, you know, prefects in this country.
[03:30:36.649 --> 03:30:36.909]  Yeah.
[03:30:37.029 --> 03:30:40.291]  Um, we have some folks who are, like, Trotskyists.
[03:30:40.491 --> 03:30:48.896]  Subromanian admits that he is not alone, that there are many, many DSA socialist operatives working inside our federal government.
[03:30:48.976 --> 03:30:52.138]  These people, these socialists, are not helping our government.
[03:30:52.278 --> 03:30:55.540]  They are actively subverting President Trump's policies.
[03:30:55.720 --> 03:30:57.782]  Like, we're an executive-ranked agency.
[03:30:58.522 --> 03:31:03.924]  Perfect timing with Trump battling the deep state and rogue government.
[03:31:15.509 --> 03:31:18.192]  Literally saying they're taking their orders from Hillary and Obama.
[03:31:18.232 --> 03:31:20.154]  They call her Madam President still.
[03:31:20.574 --> 03:31:24.739]  Just the arrogance, the attitude, the videos you have of them saying, we're never going to get fired.
[03:31:24.799 --> 03:31:26.761]  We're part of the Socialist and Communist Party.
[03:31:26.821 --> 03:31:28.162]  We're going to take over America.
[03:31:28.343 --> 03:31:33.388]  And so it's the arrogance, it's the chicken neckness, it's the stupidness of them.
[03:31:33.588 --> 03:31:34.889]  But then it makes me feel stupid.
[03:31:35.210 --> 03:31:38.293]  How do we ever let this much scum run our lives, James O'Keefe?
[03:31:38.433 --> 03:31:54.196]  Well, Alex, you know, this is why maybe we need civil service reform, because the Deep State is not just the director of the intelligence agency and Rosenstein and whoever else, it's also millions of foot soldiers, thousands and thousands of these people that we've caught on tape.
[03:31:54.656 --> 03:31:56.616]  This is just a small cross-sampling of them.
[03:31:57.176 --> 03:32:06.958]  And yes, if you look at these tapes, what's remarkable is, I mean, the guy that we released Thursday, this self-described communist inside a government auditor's office,
[03:32:07.538 --> 03:32:27.243]  He says, what I do is explicitly prohibited, I'm hungover, I don't even go to work, I spend my time, this is what he says on the tape, I spend my time electing democratic socialists and I lied on my forms to the federal government, but nothing will ever happen to me because there's no oversight, nobody will care, it's impossible to get fired.
[03:32:28.123 --> 03:32:31.386]  There he is right there, Nate Subramanian, auditor at GAO.
[03:32:31.806 --> 03:32:35.249]  So it's just, these are what they call the Democratic Socialists of America.
[03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:36.930]  A lot of them are federal employees.
[03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:38.592]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[03:32:38.992 --> 03:32:40.033]  This is videotape.
[03:32:40.153 --> 03:32:46.498]  And by the way, the man you're looking at right there, that man right there, he has been shown the door at GAO.
[03:32:46.898 --> 03:32:51.784]  While they can't, may not be able to, quote, fire him, they have removed him from the building.
[03:32:51.804 --> 03:32:53.526]  This is like a Greek tragedy.
[03:32:53.566 --> 03:32:58.051]  They can't fire the people, so they just have to, like, take them away from their computer systems.
[03:33:03.497 --> 03:33:06.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:43.708 --> 03:33:45.009]  Pat Bracken is our guest.
[03:33:46.430 --> 03:33:49.992]  There's an article that just broke on Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:51.493 --> 03:33:55.356]  And this just goes to the fact that no one is buying mainstream corporate media anymore.
[03:33:55.476 --> 03:33:57.137]  No one is buying into any of it.
[03:33:58.217 --> 03:33:59.038]  Candace Owens!
[03:34:00.964 --> 03:34:05.086]  Timing of mail bombs targeting Democrats is suspicious.
[03:34:05.787 --> 03:34:07.768]  Leftists are going all out.
[03:34:08.548 --> 03:34:10.769]  Caravans, fake bomb threats.
[03:34:11.610 --> 03:34:13.611]  These leftists are going all out in midterms.
[03:34:13.651 --> 03:34:14.891]  And they do look like fake bombs.
[03:34:14.911 --> 03:34:15.552]  They didn't go off.
[03:34:16.152 --> 03:34:17.293]  I don't want to say that too much, though.
[03:34:17.333 --> 03:34:20.594]  Mail a real one and blow up some mail carriers' hands to make it look real.
[03:34:21.315 --> 03:34:27.098]  I'm going to go ahead and state that there is 0% chance that these suspicious packages were sent by conservatives, she tweeted.
[03:34:28.322 --> 03:34:30.424]  The only thing suspicious about these packages is their timing.
[03:34:30.844 --> 03:34:31.585]  Thirteen days out.
[03:34:31.985 --> 03:34:32.406]  Canvas.
[03:34:33.167 --> 03:34:33.707]  Caravans.
[03:34:33.767 --> 03:34:34.328]  Fake bombs.
[03:34:34.348 --> 03:34:36.470]  These leftists are going all out for midterms.
[03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:37.210]  Owens.
[03:34:38.231 --> 03:34:38.472]  Added.
[03:34:39.152 --> 03:34:45.078]  I'm going to go ahead and state that there's a 0% chance that these suspicious packages were sent out by conservatives.
[03:34:45.558 --> 03:34:48.001]  The only thing suspicious about these packages is their timing.
[03:34:48.441 --> 03:34:48.902]  Caravans.
[03:34:48.982 --> 03:34:49.762]  Fake bomb threats.
[03:34:49.782 --> 03:34:52.105]  These leftists are going all out for the midterms.
[03:34:52.685 --> 03:35:00.913]  That's what everybody else is saying, my military veterans and terrorism experts and Matt Bracken, terrorism expert, with us right now.
[03:35:01.833 --> 03:35:06.958]  So read the story at InfoWars.com and at NewsWars.com.
[03:35:07.038 --> 03:35:11.922]  But the fact that they want me shut down before the midterms, the fact that they want you silenced before the midterms,
[03:35:12.523 --> 03:35:15.184]  The fact that they want all this means they're going to pull a lot of things.
[03:35:15.204 --> 03:35:16.925]  This caravan, all of it.
[03:35:17.386 --> 03:35:26.210]  And as they get more and more desperate, Matt Bracken, we're going to go to some calls now, but briefly, what do you expect else is in their weapons system, in their quiver?
[03:35:28.051 --> 03:35:35.875]  Yeah, if this turns out to be a hoax, and I think that the FBI is going to wrap this thing up because it's a panic move.
[03:35:35.915 --> 03:35:39.277]  You know, it's somebody in a rush to change the narrative.
[03:35:39.841 --> 03:35:40.762]  From the caravans.
[03:35:41.122 --> 03:35:44.104]  You know, I'll have to say one thing about Candace Owens.
[03:35:44.604 --> 03:35:46.706]  She's got more balls than Ben Shapiro.
[03:35:48.027 --> 03:35:49.427]  He's taking the opposite tack.
[03:35:49.688 --> 03:35:51.649]  Don't anybody dare say it's a false flag.
[03:35:52.162 --> 03:35:53.203]  You know, the anointed one.
[03:35:54.544 --> 03:35:55.805]  Candace is the real deal.
[03:35:56.165 --> 03:35:56.846]  She's fearless.
[03:35:57.106 --> 03:36:00.068]  And, you know, I'd go to war with her, for sure.
[03:36:01.029 --> 03:36:11.197]  Anyway, yeah, I think that instead of somebody walking into a restaurant and yelling at a Republican, I think they're going to walk into a restaurant with a gun.
[03:36:11.397 --> 03:36:12.118]  I hate to say it.
[03:36:12.751 --> 03:36:17.273]  Because they don't have any good plays left.
[03:36:17.673 --> 03:36:19.074]  They aren't going to do something brilliant.
[03:36:19.514 --> 03:36:32.440]  After this hoax bomb blows up in their face, like Kavanaugh, like the caravan, like Elizabeth Warren's DNA, the total frustration is going to lead some singleton goofball to just say, I've had it.
[03:36:33.041 --> 03:36:38.663]  And I think that somebody like, you know, what happened to Rand Paul is going to happen to somebody else.
[03:36:38.743 --> 03:36:39.644]  Or Steve Scalise.
[03:36:40.636 --> 03:36:43.418]  I think something like that is going to happen in the next couple of days.
[03:36:43.838 --> 03:36:47.019]  And that also could be false flagged, as we've discussed many times.
[03:36:47.540 --> 03:36:52.842]  You know, where you shoot at a liberal group and blame it on the right wing.
[03:36:52.862 --> 03:36:57.945]  But coming after this false flag hoax bomb, I don't think anybody will buy that either.
[03:36:57.965 --> 03:37:01.667]  I think it's going to have the opposite effect of what they would expect.
[03:37:02.127 --> 03:37:04.828]  I think they're out of cards, essentially.
[03:37:05.328 --> 03:37:06.129]  Out of ammunition.
[03:37:06.149 --> 03:37:08.050]  Because nobody will believe what they do.
[03:37:09.775 --> 03:37:14.419]  And they're so used, in their mentally ill fashion, to when they ran America because we were asleep.
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:19.464]  Now that we're awake and it's getting worse, they just can't believe that nothing's working anymore.
[03:37:21.178 --> 03:37:22.239]  Yeah, they can't believe it.
[03:37:22.379 --> 03:37:30.305]  Ever since Dan Rather and the fake memo gate, which was cracked by online sleuths, you know, not even the media, the media would have run with it.
[03:37:30.685 --> 03:37:33.107]  But online sleuths broke up that fault.
[03:37:33.147 --> 03:37:35.028]  That was a basically a false flag up.
[03:37:35.048 --> 03:37:38.411]  That was a bogus, fake memo, counterfeit memo.
[03:37:38.951 --> 03:37:41.193]  And we've cracked it ever since then.
[03:37:41.753 --> 03:37:43.655]  Their old playbook has been failing.
[03:37:44.315 --> 03:37:59.508]  I looked at an article, it was linked on Drudge, but it was a New York Channel 4, whatever that is, NBC article on the bomb sent to CNN, and out of like the first 150 comments, all of them were calling it a false flag.
[03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:07.395]  Nobody was saying... So they think burying me so I won't say false flag, it's like don't they get like...
[03:38:08.191 --> 03:38:11.392]  Politically, that was my great-great-grandchildren I had a hundred years ago.
[03:38:11.472 --> 03:38:14.033]  I mean, everybody already knows these terms now.
[03:38:15.093 --> 03:38:15.734]  It's too late.
[03:38:16.194 --> 03:38:18.735]  On CNN, they're inside their own insulated bubble.
[03:38:19.095 --> 03:38:25.777]  They're still running with, you know, the big crawl at the bottom is, you know, right-wingers suspected in bomb plot.
[03:38:26.238 --> 03:38:28.458]  But the whole rest of the country is laughing at them.
[03:38:28.878 --> 03:38:30.539]  You know, they're like the Baghdad Bob.
[03:38:30.599 --> 03:38:33.080]  They're holding on to the hope of the past.
[03:38:33.769 --> 03:38:37.990]  Everybody gets it about false flags now, and you get to take a lot of the credit for that.
[03:38:38.350 --> 03:38:39.871]  People just can't buy it with their money.
[03:38:39.951 --> 03:38:48.234]  Well, the listeners do support us, and that's why they've got to financially support us right now, because the globalists want to have a victory destroying Infowars, and so we have free shipping running right now, 50% off.
[03:38:48.254 --> 03:38:50.034]  It's got to end in the next few days.
[03:38:50.374 --> 03:38:56.576]  Biggest sale ever on the supplements, on high-quality, storable food, on all the products, InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:38:56.616 --> 03:39:00.757]  I want to thank everybody for their financial support.
[03:39:00.777 --> 03:39:01.838]  Let's take a few phone calls here.
[03:39:02.638 --> 03:39:07.159]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Washington.
[03:39:07.179 --> 03:39:07.839]  Thanks for holding, Chris.
[03:39:07.879 --> 03:39:08.739]  You're on the air with Matt Bracken.
[03:39:10.620 --> 03:39:11.860]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:13.901]  I'm doing all right, I'll tell you.
[03:39:15.301 --> 03:39:27.744]  I'll tell you, you know, I appreciate InfoWars and I really, I don't like to see that what they're doing and attacking, attacking you as well.
[03:39:27.784 --> 03:39:29.284]  You know, I don't even care about the attacks.
[03:39:29.444 --> 03:39:31.525]  I just want to have a website and to be able to fight.
[03:39:32.426 --> 03:39:34.747]  I just want to be able to have names on the videos we post.
[03:39:34.907 --> 03:39:37.888]  I want to be able to stand up in the damn ring with the globalists.
[03:39:38.249 --> 03:39:40.670]  That's all I want to be able to do is be able to reach people.
[03:39:41.010 --> 03:39:44.892]  And I don't care about, nothing matters to me except defeating these people.
[03:39:45.412 --> 03:39:47.013]  And so don't feel sorry for me, brother.
[03:39:47.393 --> 03:39:48.993]  Believe me, that's not what's getting under my saddle.
[03:39:49.013 --> 03:39:49.754]  Let me tell you, go ahead.
[03:39:49.774 --> 03:39:52.015]  The right to it is being taken away from you.
[03:39:52.775 --> 03:39:58.918]  And, you know, I hope President Trump does something to, you know, realize that, you
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:01.401]  It's not just you that's being silenced.
[03:40:01.861 --> 03:40:02.702]  It's a lot of people.
[03:40:03.362 --> 03:40:05.844]  So I hope something happens in regards to that.
[03:40:07.645 --> 03:40:09.506]  This is a false flag.
[03:40:09.946 --> 03:40:26.096]  Matt just broke it down very clearly that not one of these places that got these suspicious packages would have even had somebody been able to
[03:40:27.185 --> 03:40:28.626]  Get him in through the regular mail.
[03:40:28.826 --> 03:40:29.826]  Somebody walked in.
[03:40:30.567 --> 03:40:38.371]  The people that are going to be investigating this, just like he broke down, they're going to be able to get to the bottom of it.
[03:40:38.891 --> 03:40:43.654]  But is the mainstream media going to cover that before the election, 13 days out?
[03:40:44.454 --> 03:40:47.757]  I mean, are they really going to say, oh, these were false flags?
[03:40:47.917 --> 03:40:52.962]  It's been proven by federal agents and all these... But I think what Matt said is key.
[03:40:53.382 --> 03:40:57.346]  On mainline message boards of leftist news sites, no one's buying it.
[03:40:57.466 --> 03:40:58.147]  It's ridiculous.
[03:40:58.167 --> 03:40:58.968]  God bless you, Chris.
[03:40:59.408 --> 03:41:00.489]  I appreciate your call.
[03:41:01.330 --> 03:41:02.651]  Let's go ahead and make another call here.
[03:41:04.493 --> 03:41:08.076]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Canada.
[03:41:08.096 --> 03:41:08.637]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[03:41:11.127 --> 03:41:12.928]  Hey Alex, Matt, great show today.
[03:41:13.768 --> 03:41:17.470]  This whole pipe bomb thing is a complete $3 bill.
[03:41:18.291 --> 03:41:21.452]  Who puts stickers on something that's going to blow up?
[03:41:21.672 --> 03:41:28.095]  And if these are just rogue leftists doing this, it's going to come out.
[03:41:28.135 --> 03:41:31.117]  I totally agree with Matt that it is going to come out.
[03:41:31.724 --> 03:41:37.808]  But the media will spin it, and I think we have to be cautious, because they do put the word bomb into the narrative.
[03:41:38.688 --> 03:41:39.869]  You know, I hadn't thought of that.
[03:41:40.089 --> 03:41:46.393]  Clearly, it's like a political ad to make it look like a right-winger Senate, because they all know we call Brennan ISIS, because he is.
[03:41:46.793 --> 03:41:48.634]  And then there's Brennan's face and a sticker.
[03:41:48.914 --> 03:41:50.095]  It's not meant to blow up.
[03:41:50.175 --> 03:41:51.476]  It's meant to frame a right-winger.
[03:41:52.356 --> 03:41:53.057]  Completely, yeah.
[03:41:53.077 --> 03:41:53.557]  It's amateur.
[03:41:53.857 --> 03:41:55.518]  You have to get on the level of these idiots.
[03:41:55.558 --> 03:41:56.799]  It's hard to do, but I guess, yeah.
[03:41:57.848 --> 03:42:08.493]  Oh yeah, it's like in school when three bullies would try to frame somebody and one would throw a spitball at the blackboard and the teacher turns around and everybody points to the kid they don't like.
[03:42:08.533 --> 03:42:09.254]  That's what this is.
[03:42:09.534 --> 03:42:13.576]  This is amateur hour and it'll be proven for what it is.
[03:42:14.616 --> 03:42:16.838]  I think Jeff's the best caller of the day.
[03:42:16.878 --> 03:42:20.139]  That's a big point, Bracken, that there's stickers on it.
[03:42:20.159 --> 03:42:21.360]  This was not meant to be blown up.
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:22.660]  Beautiful.
[03:42:23.161 --> 03:42:25.722]  That's input from the caller.
[03:42:26.824 --> 03:42:30.607]  I'm going to let you take over so I don't interrupt, Matt.
[03:42:30.647 --> 03:42:39.234]  Come back and take calls here from Tim and Joe and Dan and Harry and a few others, Pastor Sam, and then the War Room's coming up 3 o'clock.
[03:42:39.254 --> 03:42:41.075]  That's like 15, 18 minutes away.
[03:42:41.496 --> 03:42:43.137]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:42:43.157 --> 03:42:51.683]  The only way to break the will of the globalist is for you to share those live links and to share the articles and the videos at Infowars.com.
[03:42:52.084 --> 03:42:54.626]  They're all there right now in the articles at Infowars.com.
[03:42:59.511 --> 03:43:03.354]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:03.674 --> 03:43:10.298]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:43:10.759 --> 03:43:15.342]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:43:15.602 --> 03:43:23.507]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide
[03:43:25.148 --> 03:43:38.198]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:43:38.618 --> 03:43:45.744]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:43:46.124 --> 03:43:58.986]  Head to infowarestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[03:44:06.087 --> 03:44:11.308]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:11.508 --> 03:44:14.249]  But the globalists now want to target
[03:44:15.365 --> 03:44:19.247]  Where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:19.507 --> 03:44:21.968]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:22.608 --> 03:44:23.449]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:27.791]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:27.871 --> 03:44:29.852]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:30.812 --> 03:44:31.752]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:31.893 --> 03:44:32.713]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:33.273 --> 03:44:34.894]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:34.914 --> 03:44:37.935]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:44:38.795 --> 03:44:41.256]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[03:44:41.816 --> 03:44:42.917]  I will never falter.
[03:44:42.937 --> 03:44:45.558]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:45.838 --> 03:44:46.558]  I physically will.
[03:44:46.978 --> 03:44:53.761]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at fullwrestle.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:44:59.789 --> 03:45:04.830]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:45:04.970 --> 03:45:13.252]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:45:13.332 --> 03:45:22.074]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[03:45:22.274 --> 03:45:24.514]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:45:24.634 --> 03:45:26.615]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[03:45:26.815 --> 03:45:27.835]  It's just incredible.
[03:45:28.495 --> 03:45:29.576]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[03:45:29.656 --> 03:45:30.837]  This is next level.
[03:45:30.897 --> 03:45:32.458]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:45:32.978 --> 03:45:37.120]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:45:37.461 --> 03:45:41.883]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:45:42.003 --> 03:45:45.465]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:45:45.485 --> 03:45:46.866]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:45:47.026 --> 03:45:49.868]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:45:50.228 --> 03:45:53.912]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[03:45:54.513 --> 03:45:59.718]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:45:59.758 --> 03:46:11.091]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[03:46:11.631 --> 03:46:15.895]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[03:46:16.276 --> 03:46:16.756]  This is it.
[03:46:17.036 --> 03:46:19.459]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[03:46:19.559 --> 03:46:21.241]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[03:46:21.421 --> 03:46:21.981]  Nanotech.
[03:46:22.181 --> 03:46:26.005]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically, just goes right to the heart of something.
[03:46:28.988 --> 03:46:30.489]  And that's the way I like it.

[03:47:02.932 --> 03:47:05.575]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:27.156 --> 03:47:30.317]  Okay, Matt Bracken back by himself for the last segment.
[03:47:31.077 --> 03:47:36.798]  And I had prepared a little talk for this show because I think it's really important.
[03:47:37.818 --> 03:47:47.661]  Down in Houston, President Trump introduced the N-word, nationalist, and it caused the globalists on the left to lose their minds.
[03:47:48.301 --> 03:47:53.842]  And I think this was another classic Trumpian move to force them to take the bait.
[03:47:54.406 --> 03:48:00.869]  Because what he's going to explain, I think, in upcoming rallies is that nationalist means patriot.
[03:48:00.969 --> 03:48:02.730]  It means America first.
[03:48:03.331 --> 03:48:06.072]  And I think that the vast majority of Americans agree with that.
[03:48:06.852 --> 03:48:12.555]  And this, I think, deserves a little bit of an explanation about why it's so important.
[03:48:13.456 --> 03:48:20.259]  Globalism is a plan like communism that requires a complete takeover of the world.
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:23.341]  And the biggest obstacle to this plan
[03:48:24.585 --> 03:48:33.874]  This spreading across the globe of Soros is free nations like America that stand as examples of another way.
[03:48:34.715 --> 03:48:37.177]  And something I've really thought about a lot.
[03:48:37.938 --> 03:48:45.605]  There are three things that are required to have a free, meaning you're not under any kind of tyranny.
[03:48:46.480 --> 03:48:52.063]  Successful and affluent, meaning you have a high standard of living, you can live in a decent house, control your own life.
[03:48:52.523 --> 03:48:56.425]  So a free and affluent society requires three things.
[03:48:57.165 --> 03:49:03.368]  Number one, it requires at least an average IQ among the average population.
[03:49:04.348 --> 03:49:06.850]  You have to have pretty smart people to figure this out.
[03:49:07.810 --> 03:49:10.051]  It requires a free market economy.
[03:49:10.291 --> 03:49:11.772]  It won't work under socialism.
[03:49:12.792 --> 03:49:16.074]  And it requires a cohesive national identity.
[03:49:16.661 --> 03:49:36.093]  So you can see some examples of successful countries would be the USA, various European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and more lately since World War Two, Japan and South Korea have shown great examples of what people can do when they have national cohesion and a national identity.
[03:49:36.853 --> 03:49:37.874]  And they're smart.
[03:49:38.734 --> 03:49:44.778]  And they unleash the power of the free market engine, the wealth creating machine of the free market
[03:49:46.254 --> 03:49:48.255]  Almost anything is possible.
[03:49:48.696 --> 03:49:54.919]  If you look at Seoul, Korea, or Tokyo that were flattened in World War II, and you look at their skylines today.
[03:49:55.460 --> 03:49:59.522]  Now, some countries can become wealthy, but not free.
[03:49:59.722 --> 03:50:01.583]  That would be Communist China.
[03:50:02.184 --> 03:50:07.907]  So they've unleashed some of the free market economy, but politically it's still a tyranny.
[03:50:08.788 --> 03:50:14.311]  Now, if you have a group with a high IQ, like the USA has had,
[03:50:15.171 --> 03:50:27.239]  And you want to see the USA destroyed, one of the ways that you do it is to trigger the country into accepting millions and millions of low IQ people from the third world.
[03:50:27.579 --> 03:50:28.980]  This does two different things.
[03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:35.504]  It lowers the average IQ, and it also destroys the national cohesion.
[03:50:35.584 --> 03:50:37.105]  It balkanizes the country.
[03:50:37.586 --> 03:50:43.830]  So if your goal is to destroy the United States, to wreck it as a successful free country,
[03:50:44.548 --> 03:50:46.089]  You would do this, exactly this.
[03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:51.814]  I have nothing against people from Honduras, but I think their average IQ is like in the neighborhood of 80.
[03:50:52.775 --> 03:51:05.486]  Now, there are a couple of concepts that it's required for people to grasp in order to have a successful society, and these concepts just don't click with people who have low IQs.
[03:51:06.106 --> 03:51:07.988]  One of these concepts is
[03:51:08.695 --> 03:51:08.855]  Is it?
[03:51:28.642 --> 03:51:28.942]  I think?
[03:51:47.344 --> 03:51:54.566]  If your political party loses, you don't go Uganda and kill everybody that won in the election.
[03:51:54.606 --> 03:51:58.227]  You don't go Hutu and Bantu like Rwanda.
[03:51:58.527 --> 03:52:01.368]  You just say, all right, we have to retool our message.
[03:52:01.608 --> 03:52:07.530]  The important thing is that we maintain the rule of law and a civil society, even when we're out of power.
[03:52:08.130 --> 03:52:10.553]  Low IQ people can't comprehend that.
[03:52:10.973 --> 03:52:16.959]  So these two concepts, deferred self-gratification and enlightened self-interest, they are key.
[03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:25.528]  Low IQ people cannot grasp these or the importance of free market capitalism to become a wealth engine.
[03:52:26.357 --> 03:52:39.442]  What this means is that demagogues, once you have enough low IQ people, a majority, demagogues will always be elected on the promise to these people that they're going to kill the golden goose.
[03:52:39.522 --> 03:52:46.344]  They say, the golden goose is a conspiracy of the rich, and we're going to grab that goose and get all the eggs and give it to you.
[03:52:47.097 --> 03:52:51.642]  Intelligent people would say, wait a minute, if you kill the golden goose, there'll be no gold tomorrow.
[03:52:52.162 --> 03:52:56.487]  That's deferred gratification, enlightened self-interest, free market economics.
[03:52:57.107 --> 03:53:05.736]  If you bring in enough really low-level IQ people, you are bound to turn your country into a Mexico or a Honduras.
[03:53:06.297 --> 03:53:07.258]  It just goes with it.
[03:53:07.839 --> 03:53:12.943]  So, globalism, I would consider a secular religion like communism.
[03:53:13.323 --> 03:53:15.624]  This is why you see the rage on the left.
[03:53:16.025 --> 03:53:17.726]  To them, it really is a religion.
[03:53:17.786 --> 03:53:21.509]  It's like you're attacking their religion when you attack globalism.
[03:53:21.869 --> 03:53:28.213]  When you say you're a nationalist, to them, you are the antichrist to their secular religion.
[03:53:28.273 --> 03:53:33.557]  You are attacking the foundation, which is that all peoples have to be leveled everywhere.
[03:53:34.197 --> 03:53:54.487]  The Kalergi Plan has to be conducted across the entire planet until there's no Germans, no Americans, no Canadians, just one mixed people with a low IQ who are going to need the elites as a ruling class to be the brains of the operation.
[03:53:54.507 --> 03:53:57.248]  Of course, the elites will live in gated communities.
[03:53:57.768 --> 03:54:02.751]  They'll fly helicopters because these morons that they're in charge of
[03:54:03.581 --> 03:54:06.544]  Can't possibly run the society on their own.
[03:54:07.604 --> 03:54:13.990]  Of course, what we're seeing now with the so-called caravan is this plan being put into action.
[03:54:14.991 --> 03:54:28.542]  Another way that this plan is put into action, and it's been succeeding for the last almost a century, the Frankfurt School in Germany was transplanted to Columbia University, then spread throughout the American university system.
[03:54:30.245 --> 03:54:30.505]  I think?
[03:54:51.397 --> 03:54:58.721]  That's why the NPC meme idea is so powerful, because they really, their heads are full of idiocy.
[03:54:59.161 --> 03:55:06.444]  They believe, for example, that we must welcome Islam, and we must also be against women being attacked.
[03:55:06.785 --> 03:55:09.366]  Well, if you put the two together, women get attacked.
[03:55:09.926 --> 03:55:12.247]  But they're just little brainwashed zombies.
[03:55:12.668 --> 03:55:15.309]  So we have, from within our own society,
[03:55:16.292 --> 03:55:25.554]  A rising generation of millennial idiots that have been brainwashed into believing globalism, which any kind of analysis, it falls apart.
[03:55:26.514 --> 03:55:32.216]  Just what I've said in the last ten minutes would red pill anybody capable of second level thinking.
[03:55:32.756 --> 03:55:36.277]  But to the globalists, it's all worth it.
[03:55:37.327 --> 03:55:48.634]  They truly believe that as long as the USA and Europe exist as successful beacons, as examples, they're never going to accomplish their globalist dream.
[03:55:48.974 --> 03:55:59.580]  They have to literally wreck Germany, wreck Sweden, wreck Australia, average everybody out to somewhere between Honduras and America, which might be like Mexico,
[03:56:00.320 --> 03:56:13.527]  And then we'll be run by these elites that are, in their own mind, sort of a new aristocracy of the Brainiacs, who will be running the entire show, whether we like it or not.
[03:56:14.007 --> 03:56:16.388]  We'll be the serfs on their plantation.
[03:56:16.888 --> 03:56:20.410]  That's why they hate it when we make memes like this.
[03:56:21.070 --> 03:56:22.511]  I've been kicked off of Facebook.
[03:56:23.126 --> 03:56:30.391]  Thirty days, six times in the last year, for posting memes like the ones that you've just seen on the screen.
[03:56:30.972 --> 03:56:34.274]  That gets you banned on Facebook today, putting up memes like this.
[03:56:34.734 --> 03:56:35.795]  Thirty days at a time.
[03:56:36.276 --> 03:56:39.458]  So, they definitely want to control the narrative and shut it down.
[03:56:40.078 --> 03:56:41.079]  And we're winning.
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:49.586]  The fact that this hoax pipe bomb scheme is unraveling in the first day shows that they can't control the narrative.
[03:56:49.947 --> 03:56:51.608]  All of their tricks are backfiring.
[03:56:51.928 --> 03:56:58.334]  So we really do have a great chance at making a breakthrough with the midterm elections.
[03:56:58.734 --> 03:57:01.577]  But what it's going to come down to is voting.
[03:57:02.678 --> 03:57:03.938]  Who's more motivated?
[03:57:04.459 --> 03:57:20.850]  If we do like we did in 2016 in electing President Trump, if we send a message, you know, the jobs versus mobs, if we get out there and we just assault the precincts early, online, mail voting, in person, but we have to swamp them.
[03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:24.092]  It's the only way we're going to just slap down the left.
[03:57:24.672 --> 03:57:31.638]  And to set them back on their heels and maybe come through this and educate ourselves about this long-term globalist plan.
[03:57:32.239 --> 03:57:33.880]  It's the only way we're going to come through it.
[03:57:34.881 --> 03:57:40.545]  Anyway, thanks a lot and I'll see you the next time they have me on InfoWars, which I hope is soon.
[03:57:41.706 --> 03:57:42.147]  Bye bye.
[03:58:08.064 --> 03:58:08.804]  You laughed at me.
[03:58:13.187 --> 03:58:15.588]  You've been in love with something else your whole life.
[03:58:16.488 --> 03:58:17.429]  And this is a love affair.
[03:58:18.869 --> 03:58:21.270]  And so, I'm not gonna get in bed with you.
[03:58:23.832 --> 03:58:26.133]  Because you don't love the spirit of justice.
[03:58:26.853 --> 03:58:28.714]  You love your father the devil.
[03:58:30.175 --> 03:58:32.436]  You love death more than life.
[03:58:33.683 --> 03:58:38.224]  So you go with your father forever.
[03:58:38.824 --> 03:58:39.445]  And that's hell.
[03:58:39.985 --> 03:58:41.025]  Separation from God.
[03:58:42.605 --> 03:58:46.226]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[03:58:46.426 --> 03:58:48.507]  You'll never defeat God!
[03:58:48.727 --> 03:58:50.548]  You'll never win!
[03:58:51.608 --> 03:58:52.348]  Never!
[03:58:53.228 --> 03:58:54.649]  Never ever!
[03:58:55.169 --> 03:58:57.109]  And this is where we get tested!
[03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:59.650]  So rejoice to God Almighty!
