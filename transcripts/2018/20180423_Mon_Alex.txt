[00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:16.552]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:29.343]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:29.583]  Scum!
[00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:33.927]  Russian scum!
[00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:44.171]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new counterculture is Renaissance.
[00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:54.439]  The Renaissance that started more than 500 years ago with the Gutenberg press in Europe
[00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:08.641]  Is now back.
[00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:14.983]  You know, they had Jordan Klepper and the opposition, I'm told.
[00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:16.363]  I talked to Paul Watson this morning.
[00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:20.524]  Attacked Paul for saying that conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:22.764]  And they said, that's ridiculous.
[00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:28.646]  The Republicans control the House, the Senate, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:37.128]  But they don't control any of Hollywood, any of the mainstream media.
[00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:46.041]  They don't control the colleges that almost to a college are globalist and socialist and anti-human, anti-family, anti-Christian.
[00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:49.584]  They don't control a single of the giant tech companies.
[00:01:51.705 --> 00:02:00.552]  Media and money and power on this planet is globalist, is authoritarian, masquerading as leftist and neoliberal.
[00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:03.554]  That is a incontrovertible fact.
[00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:07.817]  Here's an example.
[00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:08.277]  Newsweek.
[00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:14.022]  Why hasn't Melania Trump been on the cover of any magazines since becoming first lady, they asked last week?
[00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:18.166]  It's because she hasn't been approached.
[00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.248]  Because she's seen as a polarizing figure.
[00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:27.294]  As if Michael Obama wasn't a polarizing figure.
[00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:28.015]  I'm just joking.
[00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:29.916]  So.
[00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.296]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:34.518]  She makes Trump look good.
[00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.681]  She's got incredible positive numbers in national polls.
[00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.825]  They don't want Trump to look good, so they don't show you his wife.
[00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:43.606]  They can't stand it.
[00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:50.752]  That's just a little microcosm of all of it, and how they know they're the establishment, how people are running from them.
[00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:52.234]  Kanye West.
[00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:59.413]  I don't really like the Kardashians and all that stuff so I just said I didn't like him years ago because I didn't follow him.
[00:03:00.053 --> 00:03:16.096]  Now that I've actually followed him the last few years and what he does with Trump and how he's standing up for different journalists and activists, embraces black Trump supporter that we've had on the broadcast many times and I'm gonna try to get on today if we can.
[00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:22.517]  And they've been demonizing him for doing that now.
[00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:30.459]  And he's got some powerful quotes that we're living in a police state in this country.
[00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:36.084]  That we're living in basically a mind control system.
[00:03:36.124 --> 00:03:41.288]  In fact, I actually screenshotted today when I was reading it, one of his quotes.
[00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.872]  Let me pull this up because I wanted to start the broadcast with this here.
[00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:51.557]  Here's the quote.
[00:03:52.938 --> 00:03:54.819]  Racism is a dated concept.
[00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.001]  It's not an actual thing that means anything.
[00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.863]  It's a chain used in the past to hold people back.
[00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:06.187]  That is a thousand percent on target.
[00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:12.310]  Doesn't mean there aren't people that operate according to that system, but it's being pushed by the left, by the globalists.
[00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.733]  They're rebooting it all and creating a total victimology culture.
[00:04:17.053 --> 00:04:22.177]  And the Me Too movement is about women learning about this valued thing they've got that they're in a victim class.
[00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:34.386]  That they can learn how to have giant chips on their shoulders and learn how to not get a good job or be in management because they have fundamental mental problems that have been injected into their minds.
[00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:37.991]  That's what the WikiLeaks say all of this is about.
[00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.434]  So yes, Infowars is the avant-garde.
[00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:45.156]  Libertarian Renaissance is the avant-garde.
[00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:46.277]  We are the future.
[00:04:47.058 --> 00:04:48.539]  Not the old state Republican Party.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.422]  But the whole revolution to take the government back is happening within the Republican Party.
[00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:54.384]  We'll take the left back soon as well.
[00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.226]  We are the counterculture.
[00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:56.926]  We are victory.
[00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.570]  Evidenced by our success and the fact we're under total attack.
[00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:08.127]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:11.059]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:13.730]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.872]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:18.832]  You want answers?
[00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:20.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:28.037]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday, the 23rd day of April 2018 Global Transmission.
[00:06:42.142 --> 00:07:00.655]  I am your host Alex Jones, and you are tuned in to the most hated, most demonized multimedia global transmission in the world by criminals, by scumbags, by kleptocrats, by globalist billionaires, by pedophiles, by occultists, by Satanists, by psychopaths, by control freaks.
[00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:09.702]  You know a man by his enemies, and we have amongst the worst people in the world as our enemies, and I wear it.
[00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:12.154]  As an extreme badge of honor.
[00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:15.815]  You know, there's the victim culture out there.
[00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.096]  And the conservatives have it to a certain extent.
[00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:22.577]  The liberals, that is their religion.
[00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:25.458]  That is their whole ether in which they swim.
[00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:28.179]  The Me Too movement.
[00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:33.120]  The whole everybody that's white is a racist movement pushed by the corporate media.
[00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.882]  But then you see the self-help groups.
[00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:44.593]  And the positivity movements out there, in fitness and in life coaching.
[00:07:45.394 --> 00:07:56.543]  And it's so positive, and so about yourself, and so about blinders on, to not face the negative going on, that it allows the negative to grow all around you.
[00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:06.831]  So there's a real balance in all of this, but the true positivity is taking on the bad guys and defending the innocent.
[00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:19.129]  But that means also being willing to be criticized, being willing to be attacked.
[00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:21.710]  You see, I'm a trailblazer.
[00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:24.891]  I'm not here to
[00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:55.707]  Personally only get ahead monetarily for myself because if I have that worldview like all the other sociopaths or sellouts Then there'll be no civilization for me to even spend the money in or a future for my children Doesn't mean I don't like money or don't like nice things or don't like having Being able to travel or be able to take care of my children, but it's not my god, and I'm not for sale But so many people
[00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:20.448]  Are afraid of upsetting anybody, and so they live in these isolated little bubbles, and then the corporate media can say, well say you don't like mothers and fathers, and say you won't use the word he or she, use she or zee, and say you think the atomic family is bad, and say you think Christianity is bad, and say you think heterosexual lifestyles are bad.
[00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:27.897]  And people go, okay, I will, because you want to then conform to whatever the norm is that media puts out.
[00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:31.240]  And I was thinking about this just this morning.
[00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:36.324]  Candace Owens, super smart, super talented lady.
[00:09:37.438 --> 00:09:46.905]  A human being, say a black lady or a white lady, who cares, who's been on this broadcast several times, who Paul Watson pointed my attention out to like six, eight months ago.
[00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:52.269]  And I remember we flew her to Austin to talk to her and get her in studio.
[00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:57.353]  And I even talked about as soon as we got the budget done and got the studios built trying to hire her, she was very interested.
[00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:04.539]  And then I remember getting flooded with emails and texts and calls saying, you shouldn't have her on from the liberals, but also from the alt-right.
[00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:07.762]  And I remember some of the crew said, well, do you have any concerns about her?
[00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:10.945]  I said, no, that's all a whisper campaign to keep us from having her on the show.
[00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:16.331]  Six months later, I think she's been on a few of the shows, but hasn't been back on just because time flies by.
[00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:19.114]  I told Daria, I said, call and get her on right now.
[00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:21.656]  She's at the center of attention with this Kanye West thing.
[00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:22.878]  And I said, I want her on routinely.
[00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:24.980]  And I said, why haven't we got her on?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.461]  She says, just time flew by.
[00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:26.802]  We didn't.
[00:10:28.664 --> 00:10:31.607]  And they kind of wait for me as the head producer to say when I want somebody on.
[00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:35.391]  No, I want people like her on routinely because the system's so scared of her.
[00:10:36.632 --> 00:10:39.115]  Whoever's getting the heat is who I want on.
[00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:40.916]  See, Kanye West knows that.
[00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:52.328]  He knows the left's trying to shackle people with chips on their shoulders and inferiority complexes or racism.
[00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:58.139]  Paradoxes, when he goes and sees half his fans being young white women and men.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.622]  And he knows that's not true in the mainstay.
[00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:08.668]  And so he's talking about how they're shackling people, how they're enslaving people, how they're controlling people.
[00:11:08.688 --> 00:11:11.311]  He said, I love the way Candace Owen thinks.
[00:11:12.752 --> 00:11:14.253]  So now they're ganging up on him.
[00:11:14.294 --> 00:11:17.777]  You see, he's the only superstar, one of the top three people grossing.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.281]  Who will actually say they're a libertarian, or a conservative, or a nationalist.
[00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:26.583]  You don't even hear that from a George Strait, who I know is a big patriot.
[00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:32.725]  You don't hear it from a Kurt Russell, because they attacked him when he spoke out, super eloquently.
[00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:40.888]  Or even, maybe, a Clint Eastwood, who says a few things and then gets attacked, but barely sticks his head up.
[00:11:41.508 --> 00:11:45.529]  Kanye comes in bold and says, they got black people on the racism plantation.
[00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:46.790]  This is mind control.
[00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.510]  This is fraud.
[00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:56.056]  They threw him in a mental institution for a week and a half last year, saying they thought he went crazy because he supported Trump.
[00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:58.858]  That's America.
[00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.219]  That's the new Soviet Union.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.622]  Look at Taylor Swift, the number one grossing artist in the world.
[00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:17.672]  She just won't get political and attack Trump, and has American flags and things in some of her videos, and so they're attacking and demonizing her, calling her a white supremacist all over the news.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.681]  So you see, that's what's going on.
[00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:29.304]  So there's one thing I really recognize, and something I support, and something I admire, and that's courage.
[00:12:32.526 --> 00:12:39.371]  The fact that they threw him in a mental institution, they hospitalized him for almost two weeks because he supported Trump, and they said it in the news.
[00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:41.153]  He's lost his mind.
[00:12:42.453 --> 00:12:43.794]  No, he hasn't lost his mind.
[00:12:43.814 --> 00:12:44.835]  Look at the economy coming back.
[00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:45.656]  Look at everything happening.
[00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:47.397]  He's been friends with Trump for a decade.
[00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:48.798]  He knows Trump's a good guy.
[00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:51.600]  He knows it's a sack of bull.
[00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:56.735]  He knows Trump's actually batting for the American people, trying to give everybody a real shot.
[00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:03.300]  And so now, what do we have dovetailing with all this?
[00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:09.524]  Alan West, Facebook, Google, and Twitter are at war with conservatives online.
[00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:12.667]  It's time to fight back.
[00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:16.473]  Fox News, absolutely.
[00:13:16.953 --> 00:13:23.316]  Kanye West blasts Thought Police up on Infowars.com after he attacked for endorsing conservative commentator.
[00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:27.718]  We have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought.
[00:13:27.978 --> 00:13:29.619]  Meanwhile, we have the video coming up after the break.
[00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:30.619]  Video!
[00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:40.664]  Clinton logs efforts to censor alternative media and says intensify it because she says there's a war on truth and she's the guardian along with the half billion dollar
[00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:48.939]  Funded Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL with its billions that now run Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, admittedly.
[00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:56.067]  Saying American flag, supporting veterans, being a capitalist, supporting Trump as white supremacist.
[00:13:56.628 --> 00:14:01.413]  This is the guardian of truth, this monstrous, bloodthirsty, evil criminal.
[00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:12.204]  That turned the Middle East with Obama over the most radical forms of Islam to kill over a million people in the Arab Spring, enslave hundreds of thousands of women, kill thousands of children.
[00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:28.609]  This evil establishment crackerhead who used, and I'm not knocking it, but in her case she uses racism, rebel flags in their gubernatorial runs and wins, and who said black people are like animals.
[00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:32.717]  Super predators that must be brought to heel like a dog.
[00:14:33.198 --> 00:14:34.538]  But we ought to play that clip all the time.
[00:14:34.558 --> 00:14:36.519]  Because that's who still runs the Democratic Party.
[00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.820]  She still runs it.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.660]  That's who we're up against.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.560]  Her and Soros.
[00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:41.981]  A weirdo, freak, Nazi collaborator.
[00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:52.946]  And this monster woman, whose first job was getting thrown off the committee in Congress for creating fake evidence against Nixon.
[00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.067]  Her second job was representing pedophiles.
[00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:56.708]  Child rapists.
[00:14:57.368 --> 00:14:58.909]  Brutal child kidnappers.
[00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:04.738]  Where seven men raped a little 10-year-old girl until her body came out of her.
[00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:06.319]  And she laughed about it.
[00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:07.140]  We got that audio.
[00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:10.382]  How she knew they were guilty, but how funny it was to get them off.
[00:15:10.823 --> 00:15:11.964]  And she laughed about it.
[00:15:12.004 --> 00:15:19.029]  It's so much fun when a little girl's in a shack for 10 hours with full-grown men knocking the bottom out of them.
[00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.844]  This is what you're talking about is a savage demon.
[00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:26.826]  A pit of hell scum.
[00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:33.832]  And she's up there on her hind legs saying, I'm gonna piss on the First Amendment and we're gonna dominate Dark Heart Jones.
[00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:35.694]  We're gonna bring Alex Jones down!
[00:15:35.714 --> 00:15:39.237]  Because they think if they can bring down us, they see us as Americana.
[00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:43.841]  By the way, Zack just got grabbed at the International Airport in San Francisco by the FBI.
[00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.262]  He was about to come on the show.
[00:15:46.223 --> 00:15:47.845]  Can't wait until he reveals his real identity on air.
[00:15:49.153 --> 00:15:50.475]  That's for coming on the show, folks.
[00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.819]  I've given you that data yesterday.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.562]  People have no idea how hardcore this all is.
[00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:55.664]  So here's the deal.
[00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:00.974]  Everybody who's got soul and guts and a heart knows it's time to fight back.
[00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:22.459]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:28.141]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:29.521]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:29.962 --> 00:16:32.783]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.443 --> 00:16:34.403]  And so much more.
[00:16:34.983 --> 00:16:36.104]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:38.044]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:43.746]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.066]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:47.007]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:49.467]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:50.968]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:52.928]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:54.089]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:55.509]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:56.789]  Infowarslime.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:02.193 --> 00:17:05.395]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:07.156]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:17:07.636 --> 00:17:19.182]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:28.727]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:35.031]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:39.894]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:42.716]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:17:43.056 --> 00:17:44.417]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:54.423]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:54.523 --> 00:17:56.645]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:17:57.185 --> 00:18:02.047]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:02.287 --> 00:18:03.707]  Clean, pure drinking water.

[00:18:05.448 --> 00:18:06.348]  But where do you get it?

[00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:39.481]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:43.521]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.363]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:09.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.741]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:22.045]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:32.130]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.451]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:20:36.624 --> 00:20:41.445]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Gaddafi has led to a failed state.
[00:20:46.226 --> 00:20:53.248]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[00:20:53.648 --> 00:20:54.928]  It was a sovereign state.
[00:20:56.328 --> 00:21:03.090]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.810]  I don't know.
[00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:09.836]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be?
[00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:14.621]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.466]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:19.407]  They're mistreated.
[00:21:20.087 --> 00:21:21.469]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:21:21.769 --> 00:21:22.690]  We led ISIS.
[00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:24.667]  Take this position.
[00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:31.172]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:21:31.472 --> 00:21:42.982]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[00:21:43.642 --> 00:21:44.823]  And we were successful.
[00:21:44.863 --> 00:21:47.045]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:21:47.165 --> 00:21:53.651]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[00:21:54.391 --> 00:21:58.435]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:02.018]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[00:22:02.518 --> 00:22:06.082]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[00:22:06.282 --> 00:22:11.026]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:20.695]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:22.497]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:34.308]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:22:34.488 --> 00:22:39.294]  Our whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[00:22:39.475 --> 00:22:42.779]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:50.469]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation.
[00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:55.991]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[00:22:56.432 --> 00:23:03.194]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[00:23:03.535 --> 00:23:05.675]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[00:23:06.016 --> 00:23:16.100]  There's a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.684]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:23:21.404 --> 00:23:27.929]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:23:40.802 --> 00:23:42.243]  We've got the globalist number.
[00:23:42.623 --> 00:23:47.485]  We know who they are, what their plans are, and now Trump's got the courage to stand against them.
[00:23:47.545 --> 00:23:48.986]  You have the courage to stand against them.
[00:23:50.206 --> 00:23:52.287]  Kanye West has the courage to stand against them.
[00:23:52.487 --> 00:23:54.468]  Candace Owens has the strength to stand against them.
[00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:57.049]  They are the thought police.
[00:23:57.229 --> 00:23:58.430]  They are the authoritarians.
[00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.531]  In Europe, they arrest you if you criticize radical Islam.
[00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:03.512]  They've indicted, again, Marie Le Pen.
[00:24:04.537 --> 00:24:06.798]  Who is leading in presidential polls over there.
[00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:12.841]  Macron, that's been for open borders and globalism, suddenly has done an about-face and is saying he wants to control the borders.
[00:24:13.782 --> 00:24:23.667]  He's under fire from his own party for strict immigration controls passing through their highest chamber.
[00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:26.329]  So a lot is going on.
[00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:27.189]  We're on the march.
[00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:28.950]  The globalists are on the run.
[00:24:30.811 --> 00:24:31.632]  But Hillary Clinton
[00:24:32.628 --> 00:24:35.930]  Came out of stories on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.332]  Clinton lauds efforts to censor alternative media.
[00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:46.855]  Crooked Hillary whines about living through an all-out war on truth, facts, and reason.
[00:24:48.296 --> 00:24:59.202]  And then she tries to use us as the example when she was at Penn State, but then didn't
[00:25:01.664 --> 00:25:09.567]  When she did that, ever actually give any of the things that we're lying about.
[00:25:11.607 --> 00:25:14.508]  She is the guardian of the truth, though, and she needs to take your rights.
[00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:16.229]  She needs to take your freedom.
[00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:23.691]  And then the little specialized folks they brought into the big tech giants that are going to run your life, they're just the bosses and they're going to protect us.
[00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.452]  And they get trained on the anti-free speech universities.
[00:25:28.578 --> 00:25:42.363]  They get trained by the Comedy Central Brainwashing Brigade, they get trained by all the political correctness that laces every major Hollywood production, every mainstream media production, that then just hammers the most weak-minded followers.
[00:25:42.383 --> 00:25:49.646]  Have you ever wondered why modern liberals are like drooling, low IQ, stupid, hateful people?
[00:25:52.947 --> 00:25:55.508]  It's because they are the dumbest of the dumb.
[00:25:56.633 --> 00:26:01.077]  The successful, the intelligent, the informed, the mavericks, the trailblazers.
[00:26:02.117 --> 00:26:04.379]  They know authoritarianism when they see it.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.822]  And people know what this broadcast is really all about.
[00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:18.951]  They're just trying to demonize me in every platform and every system ahead of not just the lawsuits, the fake lawsuits, the frivolous lawsuits, but
[00:26:20.043 --> 00:26:24.904]  They're trying to get one of their little bots, one of their little minions, to physically attack me or kill me.
[00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:26.784]  Just like Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:26:26.804 --> 00:26:28.705]  I'm going to get back on the show as soon as possible.
[00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:30.925]  He got booed out of a bar.
[00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:33.366]  People screaming, Nazi, get out of here, a bunch of leftists.
[00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:45.508]  And then meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, the leader of the whole leftist movement in America and worldwide is George Soros, a real Nazi.
[00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:50.580]  That's how dangerous these mobs of people are.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.521]  They think they're going to intimidate us?
[00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.061]  They're not.
[00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.002]  They're going to make us work harder.
[00:26:53.022 --> 00:26:54.083]  But here's Hillary.
[00:26:54.323 --> 00:26:57.226]  We're living through an all-out war on truth, facts, and reason.
[00:26:57.266 --> 00:27:02.070]  Yes, by the globalists, by the communist Chinese, by the left, by the EU.
[00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:02.671]  Here it is.
[00:27:04.052 --> 00:27:10.018]  Well, today we have a president who seems to reject the role of a free press in our democracy.
[00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:24.426]  Although obsessed with his own press coverage, he evaluates it based not on whether it provides knowledge or understanding, but solely on whether the daily coverage helps him and hurts his opponents.
[00:27:25.626 --> 00:27:29.470]  He has referred to the media as an enemy of the people.
[00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:30.992]  Let's stop right there.
[00:27:31.752 --> 00:27:32.913]  Not the media.
[00:27:33.514 --> 00:27:40.381]  CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Fake News Week that got sold out and is even owned by a worse group now.
[00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:41.903]  It's fake news.
[00:27:42.063 --> 00:27:47.629]  There's hundreds of articles a day that totally lie about me and my family that just make up whole cloth BS.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.801]  From anonymous sources.
[00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:51.862]  You are the liars.
[00:27:52.282 --> 00:27:54.423]  Trump is not attacking the First Amendment.
[00:27:55.143 --> 00:27:59.665]  It was you and Obama that had record numbers of members of the press arrested.
[00:27:59.685 --> 00:28:01.847]  That had a reign of terror against it.
[00:28:01.927 --> 00:28:03.167]  You're the ones censoring now.
[00:28:03.447 --> 00:28:05.989]  You're the ones wanting the Fairness Doctrine to shut down talk radio.
[00:28:06.329 --> 00:28:08.610]  You are a lying war criminal.
[00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.090]  Continue.
[00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:14.173]  ...suggested that broadcast licenses of some news networks should be challenged.
[00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:19.481]  He wants to block the sale of CNN to AT&T for the same reason.
[00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:26.544]  And he has repeatedly threatened Amazon because Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.
[00:28:26.564 --> 00:28:27.284]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:28:27.304 --> 00:28:28.824]  We're going to come back with more of this.
[00:28:28.844 --> 00:28:29.705]  This is so telling.
[00:28:30.697 --> 00:28:32.939]  Bezos gets $1.50 on every package.
[00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:33.799]  It's gone up from $1.48.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.621]  He gets all these other government freebies and goodies.
[00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:38.983]  He owns the Washington Post, a weaponized system.
[00:28:39.283 --> 00:28:43.206]  He got CIA contracts for hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year under Obama.
[00:28:43.506 --> 00:28:45.187]  They're waging war on our free speech.
[00:28:45.487 --> 00:28:46.828]  You're trying to get rid of our speech.
[00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:53.313]  And Trump is striking back, counter-punching against authoritarian groups that need to be broken up under antitrust.
[00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:54.314]  Amazon!
[00:28:55.335 --> 00:28:55.796]  All of them!
[00:28:56.057 --> 00:28:56.739]  Time Warner!
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.722]  Viacom!
[00:28:57.963 --> 00:28:58.444]  Google!
[00:28:58.725 --> 00:28:59.106]  Twitter!
[00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:00.029]  All of them!
[00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:00.751]  Facebook!
[00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:01.493]  Break them up!
[00:29:05.342 --> 00:29:17.192]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:27.160]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:32.185]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:41.990]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[00:29:42.831 --> 00:29:47.554]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[00:29:47.574 --> 00:29:49.114]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[00:29:49.715 --> 00:29:56.018]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[00:29:56.058 --> 00:29:56.839]  Here's my problem.
[00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:05.766]  When I do take the bodies and the extruate things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[00:30:06.186 --> 00:30:07.767]  I know, I had the same issue, yeah.
[00:30:08.188 --> 00:30:12.331]  Neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trancelot states.
[00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:17.915]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[00:30:18.095 --> 00:30:21.638]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[00:30:21.918 --> 00:30:25.882]  We went out with the top labs, we said we want the strongest concentrate.
[00:30:26.542 --> 00:30:31.626]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[00:30:46.937 --> 00:30:52.519]  Now, your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:57.221]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICP-MS mass spec testing.
[00:30:57.822 --> 00:31:01.023]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[00:31:01.363 --> 00:31:06.785]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:07.886]  Well, that's another reason.
[00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:08.486]  It's left behind.
[00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:10.627]  The top lab we ended up using to make this said that.
[00:31:10.647 --> 00:31:15.529]  They said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:16.069]  Exactly.
[00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:23.096]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[00:31:23.456 --> 00:31:27.900]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[00:31:37.409 --> 00:31:46.178]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:53.986]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:54.286 --> 00:31:56.409]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.163]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:32:05.584 --> 00:32:10.730]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:14.315]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:32:14.755 --> 00:32:18.279]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:30.169]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:41.558]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:32:41.858 --> 00:32:47.283]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.

[00:32:58.792 --> 00:33:00.173]  So please go to the site now.
[00:33:00.594 --> 00:33:02.255]  We need your support.
[00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.792 --> 00:33:17.515]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[00:33:17.535 --> 00:33:18.676]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.756 --> 00:33:19.657]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.737 --> 00:33:20.457]  From InfoWars.
[00:33:20.577 --> 00:33:21.318]  InfoWars.
[00:33:21.358 --> 00:33:21.558]  Yeah.
[00:33:21.698 --> 00:33:22.339]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:23.259]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:26.702]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[00:33:26.762 --> 00:33:29.564]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[00:33:29.644 --> 00:33:34.508]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:33:34.568 --> 00:33:39.172]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[00:33:39.352 --> 00:33:41.374]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[00:33:41.654 --> 00:33:44.556]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[00:33:44.616 --> 00:33:55.746]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website InfoWars.
[00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:58.068]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:33:58.088 --> 00:34:00.630]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:06.981]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.584]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[00:34:10.164 --> 00:34:16.290]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.513]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:20.435]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:21.556]  Move, bitch!
[00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:23.037]  Get out the way!
[00:34:23.177 --> 00:34:24.839]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:26.601]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:34:28.143 --> 00:34:29.424]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:34:29.464 --> 00:34:30.405]  Infowars.com.
[00:34:30.505 --> 00:34:31.526]  Infowars.com.
[00:34:31.586 --> 00:34:32.447]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:34:32.608 --> 00:34:34.730]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[00:34:38.294 --> 00:34:42.238]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:44.340]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:50.626 --> 00:34:58.309]  Now, you just noticed that those were clips from about a year ago of Jimmy Kimmel and people pointing a gun at me and saying, we got a message to you, Jones.
[00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:00.030]  Next, you know, it's gonna be your blood.
[00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:06.893]  He now admits that he gets advice daily from Chuckie Schumer and Hillary Clinton and George Soros to this day.
[00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.173]  Now, it's not joking.
[00:35:09.314 --> 00:35:12.595]  It's now, Alex Jones says no kids died and hates children.
[00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:14.235]  Alex Jones is a Nazi.
[00:35:15.096 --> 00:35:16.036]  They've upped the game.
[00:35:16.136 --> 00:35:17.197]  Then it's the lawsuits.
[00:35:17.297 --> 00:35:17.877]  Sue Trump.
[00:35:19.462 --> 00:35:20.984]  They're trying to break all of our wills.
[00:35:21.064 --> 00:35:30.673]  And then there's Hillary at Penn State, where the head of the university has been indicted and arrested for knowingly covering up what was going on there.
[00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:32.996]  Sandusky's son and many others.
[00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:41.845]  Sandusky was having sex with young children in the field house in the middle of the day.
[00:35:44.758 --> 00:35:47.179]  That's how rampant pedophilia is at Penn State.
[00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:57.261]  And by the way, I have insider sources and people in business I know, and it gets into the DuPonts and all the things that he was into.
[00:35:58.482 --> 00:36:07.064]  But let me tell you, they told me the sources, multiple sources, they said, Alex, it's not just pedophilia, it's devil worship.
[00:36:09.005 --> 00:36:13.366]  Penn State is heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy devil worship.
[00:36:15.954 --> 00:36:19.157]  All the ties the Clinton family has to Penn State.
[00:36:19.237 --> 00:36:19.837]  Big articles.
[00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:20.718]  Go look it up.
[00:36:20.938 --> 00:36:22.439]  And put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:28.704]  The president indicted for child endangerment and knowing what was going on.
[00:36:29.945 --> 00:36:33.188]  They were running foundations for children, disadvantaged children.
[00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.791]  And then farming them out.
[00:36:38.012 --> 00:36:40.474]  And that's why Hillary hates me because I know about
[00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:44.205]  The Lolita Express and Epstein and the child kidnapping.
[00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:44.885]  That's all admitted.
[00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:50.847]  Former Penn State President, Graham Spencer, sentenced to jail for child endangerment in Jerry Sandusty abuse case.
[00:36:54.568 --> 00:36:56.728]  What a hideous, hideous organization.
[00:36:57.088 --> 00:36:58.069]  Just like the Vatican.
[00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:02.650]  You don't get at the top unless you are a child rapist, period.
[00:37:05.511 --> 00:37:08.211]  If you are a child molester, that gets you into the first level.
[00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:10.252]  You've gotta do a lot more above that.
[00:37:12.489 --> 00:37:22.212]  Again, just like normal gangs, you gotta go rob a liquor store to get into really vicious gangs like the Crips, you gotta kill an innocent person, gotta shoot an old lady, gotta go in a liquor store and shoot the clerk.
[00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:30.335]  Three former Penn State officials get jail time for failure to report the child raping.
[00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:33.776]  What was Hillary's first job as a lawyer?
[00:37:33.836 --> 00:37:35.937]  Defending child kidnappers and rapists.
[00:37:36.197 --> 00:37:37.957]  That was her specialty.
[00:37:40.154 --> 00:37:51.020]  They had her in Time Life books in 1963 saying this woman will be president someday when she was at a JFK event and they just featured her in Time Life.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.481]  I've got that original Time Life.
[00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:55.403]  When she just graduated high school.
[00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:10.695]  She just graduated high school and they had her in Time Live saying she'll be the president and then as soon as she gets her law degree, her specialty is defending child kidnappers.
[00:38:11.776 --> 00:38:14.318]  That's how you get the crew to trust you.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.282]  Because reportedly her taste is not children, it's women.
[00:38:24.888 --> 00:38:26.870]  But you see, you gotta still be in the crew.
[00:38:28.277 --> 00:38:29.377]  And she's in the crew.
[00:38:29.838 --> 00:38:30.838]  She's on the crew.
[00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:42.422]  So it is a distinct honor to stand against these people with will and to know that I put everything on the line and I trust in Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.
[00:38:43.162 --> 00:38:51.105]  All you other people in media, all you other so-called conservatives, all you other so-called patriots, you sit back,
[00:38:53.922 --> 00:38:56.884]  And you try to play it safe, and that's why you couldn't change the world.
[00:38:57.464 --> 00:38:58.044]  Well, you know what?
[00:38:58.544 --> 00:38:59.205]  I'm no hero.
[00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:03.627]  I know these evil people don't like me because I don't have a dark heart.
[00:39:04.768 --> 00:39:10.511]  I got a strong, red-blooded heart that loves justice and is willing to put everything I got on the line to stop these people.
[00:39:11.943 --> 00:39:14.705]  And you can see evil lining up around the block against us.
[00:39:15.526 --> 00:39:30.597]  You can see Hillary at Penn State saying, how dare Trump be mean to Bezos, the richest man in the world, and how dare Trump be mean to the media that's trying to destroy him, and lying about him, and paying people to lie about him, and all this crap, when they're these big, giant, taxpayer-funded monopolies.
[00:39:31.658 --> 00:39:35.161]  NBC got, what, $5 billion in stimulus money from Bush?
[00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:36.882]  Even more from Obama?
[00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.834]  You know what I could do with $5 billion in a media operation?
[00:39:41.854 --> 00:39:45.478]  You know what you could do?
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.242]  So the threats just get more intense.
[00:39:49.883 --> 00:39:51.565]  And here's the thing, I believe in you.
[00:39:52.646 --> 00:39:54.528]  I know you're strong and I know how far we've come.
[00:39:54.768 --> 00:40:00.215]  And I know we're getting a lot of new radio affiliates and a lot of new TV affiliates and a lot of big networks putting us on.
[00:40:07.235 --> 00:40:08.756]  Just looking at Hillary and the things she's done.
[00:40:09.216 --> 00:40:13.797]  You're a radio listener, we got TV screens, or on television, and I just look at some of the stuff they put on screen.
[00:40:14.317 --> 00:40:16.558]  And it makes me sick to know what monsters these are.
[00:40:16.578 --> 00:40:24.740]  And to see Hillary, this total sociopathic demon, from the beginnings of her life, just groveling at the feet of pure evil.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.361]  Her dad was a well-known gangster.
[00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:27.701]  Operator.
[00:40:27.721 --> 00:40:29.081]  In Chicago.
[00:40:30.902 --> 00:40:31.282]  A capo.
[00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:35.296]  Her dad was a capo in the Daily Machine.
[00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:38.860]  He ran the vice departments.
[00:40:39.982 --> 00:40:41.343]  The compromising departments.
[00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:45.588]  He sent his little daughter in to work for pedophiles right out of college.
[00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.170]  Her specialty.
[00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:50.775]  We're talking brutal child rapists.
[00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:54.528]  And she doesn't want that talked about.
[00:40:54.888 --> 00:41:04.138]  You go look at her Twitter, it's all about women, women, I love women, and everything is about we're gonna do it for women, and women haven't gotten anywhere, and oh, they're only trying to shoot me down because I'm a woman.
[00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:11.365]  When we come back, we'll play the Milo clip where he gets called a Nazi and chased out of the deal, and then this Penn State speech she got.
[00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:15.630]  Perched up there at the main pedophile command base in the U.S.
[00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:25.262]  Anybody that I know has gone to Penn State, it's got a great business school, you name it, knows about it.
[00:41:25.362 --> 00:41:26.344]  Most of them aren't involved.
[00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.687]  You know, Trump went to the business school there.
[00:41:30.249 --> 00:41:30.630]  Wharton.
[00:41:32.172 --> 00:41:34.435]  Why do you think he knows where the bottom of the well is?
[00:41:35.373 --> 00:41:36.254]  Where the rabbit trail goes.
[00:41:36.274 --> 00:41:37.215]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:40.478]  If you want to send a message to these scumbags, do it every day.
[00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:46.925]  The videos, the articles, in your email, in your private feeds, hand-to-hand, handing out cards to themfulwars.com.
[00:41:47.365 --> 00:41:56.254]  I'm risking my life, my treasure, my name to do this because I know there's no future without people being trailblazers and not being like all these other men that are a bunch of wimps.
[00:41:57.936 --> 00:41:58.376]  That said,
[00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:05.547]  X-Tube is a deep earth crystal source of the very best iodine out there.
[00:42:05.587 --> 00:42:06.367]  It's changed my life.
[00:42:06.427 --> 00:42:07.648]  It's changed so many other people's lives.
[00:42:08.988 --> 00:42:09.948]  It's amazing what it does.
[00:42:10.008 --> 00:42:10.768]  It's so powerful.
[00:42:11.308 --> 00:42:12.129]  It's 25% off.
[00:42:12.629 --> 00:42:18.530]  And we did an emergency shipment so that we're able to keep it for sale for a few more days, but then it's going to sell out for about a month at least.
[00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.731]  And then it's going to be back to a regular price till I find
[00:42:24.463 --> 00:42:31.430]  Source or the price for me to get it doesn't keep going up with these oil companies that drill it and get it as a derivative.
[00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:34.233]  So if you want your X2, it's 25% off.
[00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:35.154]  That sale's about to end.

[00:43:03.194 --> 00:43:09.841]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:12.304]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:18.771]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:21.814]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:22.094 --> 00:43:25.116]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:25.476 --> 00:43:31.399]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:38.583]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:44.787]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:48.829]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:57.533]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.934 --> 00:44:04.177]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.643]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[00:44:10.284 --> 00:44:18.390]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.611]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:21.152 --> 00:44:28.097]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this, because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:28.137 --> 00:44:33.581]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:40.629]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:46.375]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:49.018]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:49.759 --> 00:44:57.205]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[00:44:57.225 --> 00:44:58.146]  They used to make drugs.
[00:44:58.326 --> 00:45:02.309]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:07.433]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:08.014 --> 00:45:11.576]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.857 --> 00:45:15.740]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.061]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:20.222]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:20.642 --> 00:45:21.982]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:22.423 --> 00:45:24.723]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.763 --> 00:45:28.005]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:28.405 --> 00:45:31.806]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:32.267 --> 00:45:35.348]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue.
[00:45:35.388 --> 00:45:36.108]  And we do get more.
[00:45:36.448 --> 00:45:43.831]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:44.992]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:45.692 --> 00:45:45.792]  Yeah.
[00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:01.130]  Pure iodine.
[00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.211]  Pure iodine.
[00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:04.535]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders.
[00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:05.536]  Just like water.
[00:46:05.636 --> 00:46:06.457]  Just like oxygen.
[00:46:06.778 --> 00:46:08.901]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:10.523]  It's available exclusively.
[00:46:10.784 --> 00:46:14.729]  Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:14.789 --> 00:46:16.091]  And I hope, like a few years ago...
[00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:18.351]  That we can work this out.
[00:46:36.491 --> 00:46:39.274]  Or what they said before, a non-zero-sum game.
[00:46:39.614 --> 00:46:47.861]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today, along with other great products, at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:52.745]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:59.751]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:05.811 --> 00:47:08.396]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:39.758]  Nobody's better on a steel guitar than Junior Brown.
[00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:45.542]  This is my Prozac right here.
[00:47:46.803 --> 00:47:51.506]  If I want to tear somebody's head off, just put on Surf Rockabilly.
[00:47:58.611 --> 00:48:00.593]  Nothing like cruising through the desert with this on.
[00:48:02.149 --> 00:48:04.330]  100 miles an hour all day long when the kids aren't in the car with you.
[00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:06.532]  Kinda nudge it up there to 150.
[00:48:08.073 --> 00:48:09.834]  Why not just go 180?
[00:48:12.636 --> 00:48:15.117]  After all, you're driving basically the same car as Mad Max.
[00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:17.238]  But even faster.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.100]  Pure Americana.
[00:48:21.881 --> 00:48:26.324]  Love it.
[00:48:26.344 --> 00:48:26.944]  Stop right there.
[00:48:27.945 --> 00:48:28.845]  I never drive like that.
[00:48:28.865 --> 00:48:29.666]  I'm just trying to act cool.
[00:48:31.044 --> 00:48:35.105]  I'd rather have a Volvo, folks.
[00:48:36.086 --> 00:48:38.847]  Man, what a time to be alive in history.
[00:48:42.768 --> 00:48:48.710]  What a time to be alive when so much is going on, when the whole future destiny of our species is being decided.
[00:48:52.351 --> 00:48:53.912]  I have a big frustration that
[00:48:55.822 --> 00:49:02.206]  I get caught up covering the minutiae of globalism and the day-to-day big breaking news instead of the guts of it.
[00:49:03.927 --> 00:49:09.511]  And the guts of globalism are about being heartless, soulless, and about using other people.
[00:49:10.912 --> 00:49:14.214]  And about seeing that as strength to be a sack of garbage.
[00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:34.889]  If you go back two years ago, so many of the people in the Clinton orbit were being busted for pedophilia.
[00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:52.641]  Child trafficking out of Haiti, into the Caribbean, Epstein's aircraft, into the Middle East, Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner, but that's just sexting people like, of course, Harvey Weinstein on board the aircraft.
[00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.699]  Kevin Spacey, all in the same pedophile aircraft.
[00:49:59.219 --> 00:50:08.165]  And it was coming out about the Vatican using child snuffing, not just raping, as ways to blackmail the last Pope so the new Pope could come in.
[00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:12.627]  The Guardian reported on it.
[00:50:12.727 --> 00:50:13.848]  And so what were they going to do?
[00:50:13.908 --> 00:50:18.130]  What were they going to do when all of the Alistair Crowley stuff came out and all the devil worship and the WikiLeaks?
[00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:24.014]  They just had the media focus in on DC, focus in on a pizzeria where none of that was going on.
[00:50:26.576 --> 00:50:33.480]  So that they could scapegoat all that and pull us all the way on to what was really going on.
[00:50:36.262 --> 00:50:37.923]  And you learn going through this stuff.
[00:50:39.084 --> 00:50:44.487]  Fighting back against this, when you're in a death battle, doesn't mean like Godzilla's, you know, fighting the bad guy.
[00:50:44.507 --> 00:50:45.848]  He didn't fall through some buildings.
[00:50:46.903 --> 00:50:49.064]  I mean, there are major casualties of war here.
[00:50:49.085 --> 00:50:50.846]  There are major collateral damage.
[00:50:50.866 --> 00:51:01.093]  And I'm not happy about the fact that when I'm swinging for the fences in these fights and doing our research and attacking the enemy, sometimes we get roped into their disinfo operations.
[00:51:03.014 --> 00:51:04.635]  But I am exponentially learning.
[00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:12.241]  And that's why I'm trying to train people around me to understand this stuff, you know.
[00:51:13.692 --> 00:51:17.233]  I think in many ways Paul Watson has surpassed my skills and understanding on air.
[00:51:17.313 --> 00:51:18.594]  And I try to get him on air more.
[00:51:18.634 --> 00:51:19.654]  That's why you see him on air.
[00:51:19.694 --> 00:51:20.594]  He didn't want to be on air.
[00:51:20.614 --> 00:51:27.777]  And then they got this ridiculous Daily Beast article where they sent somebody to England for a year to stalk Watson.
[00:51:28.477 --> 00:51:29.677]  And knock on doors and all this.
[00:51:29.697 --> 00:51:31.498]  And you read it, it's 90% bull.
[00:51:33.038 --> 00:51:37.060]  And it's how me and Watson don't like each other and how I yell at Watson all day and blah blah blah.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.681]  And how Watson's paid all this fabulous money.
[00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:41.481]  None of that's true.
[00:51:44.614 --> 00:51:49.498]  Certainly not back when my ex-wife was in the office once a month.
[00:51:50.799 --> 00:52:07.334]  And you just see these followers, these people that lie continually, quoted by these joke publications like BuzzFeed, with the pee-pee gate and all of it, and The Daily Beast.
[00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:11.157]  I mean, this is just unrecognizable from reality garbage.
[00:52:14.454 --> 00:52:16.895]  And it's very, very sad, but it doesn't even matter.
[00:52:17.916 --> 00:52:19.716]  No one even believes the lies anymore.
[00:52:22.278 --> 00:52:40.826]  But still, to waste 20 minutes of my time this morning reading it, and to just sit there, and I got up at like 6.30 in the morning, had a whole bunch of Google notifications of hundreds of articles, looked at the top one, and I was like, I'm sitting there brushing my teeth reading it, and I've got the baby, and I'm feeding her some
[00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:46.414]  Eggs this morning and I'm sitting there and I'm like, I said, I can't read this.
[00:52:46.474 --> 00:52:47.054]  It was so long.
[00:52:47.094 --> 00:52:48.355]  I said, I'm not going to read it.
[00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:49.035]  I'm not going to cover it.
[00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:53.838]  But at the same time, if I did cover it, it's like the anatomy of fraud.
[00:52:54.578 --> 00:52:56.219]  And these people know they're frauds.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.920]  They know they're lying.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:02.523]  I mean, my God, it doesn't, you think I feel persecuted?
[00:53:02.543 --> 00:53:03.063]  I don't.
[00:53:03.223 --> 00:53:04.544]  I feel sad for these people.
[00:53:05.384 --> 00:53:06.705]  Like the EEOC stuff.
[00:53:12.352 --> 00:53:18.717]  Complete, total fabrication lies, and then I haven't even pulled the Ace of Spades cards on that.
[00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:33.368]  And here's the thing, I was sitting there with the lawyers last week in a call about the fake EEOC filings against me, and I was like, man, I got all these witnesses to this stuff, and we knew something was going on at the end, so we documented it, but I don't want to bring this out, man.
[00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:39.953]  Like, I have this good side to me that's dominant, but there's a cruel side to me that goes, defend yourself, release it.
[00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:54.456]  And it just shows the total one-dimensional desperation of what the culture has created and how desperate people are and how they want that 10 minutes of fame from the mainstream media.
[00:53:54.476 --> 00:54:01.162]  10 minutes of fame is like 10 minutes of self-immolation with 93 octane gasoline.
[00:54:02.243 --> 00:54:07.748]  You get 15 minutes when they're praising you, like Megyn Kelly got attacking Trump, it destroys you.
[00:54:08.652 --> 00:54:09.873]  The mainstream media is dead.
[00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:10.514]  It's hated.
[00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:11.074]  It's over.
[00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:12.396]  This is a spiritual thing.
[00:54:12.796 --> 00:54:14.518]  You are praised by mainstream.
[00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:17.040]  It is not good.
[00:54:19.402 --> 00:54:25.708]  And it's like pouring gasoline on yourself, metaphysically, figuratively, and lighting it and going, look at me!
[00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:27.310]  I'm getting attention.
[00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.672]  It's not the attention you want.
[00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:42.533]  But then I just have a rule now, if people attack us wrongly, we cannot give them any quarter anymore.
[00:54:45.294 --> 00:54:57.561]  So, particularly on that, because it's just gonna be such optics to show what really happened versus what was said and to show how it was all manufactured.
[00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:59.462]  We have to be brutal at this point.
[00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.385]  So, that's the way it is.
[00:55:10.405 --> 00:55:13.666]  Because people have taken my kindness for weakness far too long.
[00:55:16.327 --> 00:55:17.027]  And it's the opposite.
[00:55:19.268 --> 00:55:26.690]  I have no desire to crush little people, even when they're wicked and lying and bad, in my perspective and view.
[00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:37.634]  But I have to, because the other gremlins, if I don't swat mosquitoes away and smash them,
[00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:41.344]  Then more think they can just horn in and do what they want.
[00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:46.467]  So I have to realize how the evil is using the weak and the fallen as weapons against us.
[00:55:47.107 --> 00:55:55.771]  And so I have to then make examples out of the weak and out of the deranged and out of the very, very sad.
[00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:00.113]  So I'll do what must be done.
[00:56:00.153 --> 00:56:01.414]  You have my commitment in that area.
[00:56:02.378 --> 00:56:03.898]  I didn't finish up with the Hillary speech.
[00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:04.979]  My God, it's incredible.
[00:56:05.019 --> 00:56:05.919]  And I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:56:05.959 --> 00:56:08.739]  I had some guests, but I canceled them because this is just too insane.
[00:56:08.759 --> 00:56:13.180]  I got all this big economic news and world news and mobile phones causing brain cancer.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:13.680]  More on that.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.141]  And the government declassifying a document where they mind control you with the cell towers.
[00:56:17.441 --> 00:56:18.281]  That's mainstream news.
[00:56:18.321 --> 00:56:19.121]  Popular mechanics.
[00:56:19.702 --> 00:56:26.443]  And I told you that 17 years ago because I read it in
[00:56:28.407 --> 00:56:29.287]  The Baltimore Sun.
[00:56:29.808 --> 00:56:31.929]  They were doing a test article to see how the public would respond.
[00:56:32.469 --> 00:56:33.890]  DARPA admitted it in the article.
[00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.812]  And then I thought Nick Baggage was too extreme on Art Bell, because I didn't believe anything was on Art Bell.
[00:56:38.832 --> 00:56:39.272]  I liked Art Bell.
[00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:40.152]  It was entertaining.
[00:56:40.493 --> 00:56:45.475]  Aliens, ghosts next to, you know, I think Noreed Overholt does a better job of what's fun and then what's serious.
[00:56:45.495 --> 00:56:47.416]  He demarcates it better.
[00:56:48.376 --> 00:56:50.677]  But God rest Art Bell, total talent.
[00:56:52.694 --> 00:56:56.915]  But I thought Nick Begich is a doctor, you know, his dad was a famous congressman, brother became a senator.
[00:56:57.275 --> 00:57:04.377]  I knew Begich sounded credible, but it just sounded so wild that cell towers have an oscillating frequency and it's patented to make you sexually aroused or angry or sick.
[00:57:05.498 --> 00:57:07.358]  And then now they just declassify it all.
[00:57:08.859 --> 00:57:09.299]  Last week.
[00:57:10.819 --> 00:57:16.321]  But they'd admitted it before, and that's what I mean, like, we're fighting with each other over what color we are?
[00:57:18.527 --> 00:57:24.789]  While they're putting up 5G that on record, if you think 4G and 3G gave you cancer, all confirmed.
[00:57:24.809 --> 00:57:28.050]  This is like, this is your brain on drugs?
[00:57:29.371 --> 00:57:30.291]  This is your brain and egg.
[00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:32.652]  This is your brain on drugs, the frying pan.
[00:57:32.672 --> 00:57:33.492]  I want to recreate that.
[00:57:34.392 --> 00:57:36.333]  I mean, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:57:36.813 --> 00:57:37.653]  It's confirmed!
[00:57:37.753 --> 00:57:39.134]  I have children, so do you!
[00:57:40.074 --> 00:57:41.355]  It's like, what's running this?
[00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:42.015]  Who's doing it?
[00:57:42.075 --> 00:57:44.936]  It's an evil eugenics force that wants total control!
[00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:50.468]  The globalists are all moving out the middle of nowhere where there's no Wi-Fi because they know they're cooking us!
[00:57:52.637 --> 00:57:54.677]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:57:54.917 --> 00:57:56.258]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:57:56.498 --> 00:58:00.018]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:58:00.378 --> 00:58:08.120]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.141]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:18.742]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[00:58:26.889 --> 00:58:31.332]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:40.420]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.903]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:58:51.864 --> 00:58:55.725]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:58:56.285 --> 00:59:03.687]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:59:04.388 --> 00:59:09.089]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:59:09.709 --> 00:59:11.590]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:15.651]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:18.912]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:59:19.608 --> 00:59:26.252]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:59:26.852 --> 00:59:34.097]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:59:34.957 --> 00:59:41.601]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:59:42.182 --> 00:59:43.262]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:59:43.643 --> 00:59:45.464]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:59:46.264 --> 00:59:49.226]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:59:49.766 --> 00:59:51.567]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:00.213]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:39.274]  You know, Candace Owens is a super good-looking, super smart, on-target lady.
[01:00:39.354 --> 01:00:41.455]  And it's like four months went by, she hadn't been back on the show.
[01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:42.635]  You should have gotten her on.
[01:00:44.656 --> 01:00:49.597]  And she's under all this attack for just saying black people are on a loveless plantation, so are women.
[01:00:51.217 --> 01:00:53.438]  It's just a way to victimize them and politically control them.
[01:00:54.898 --> 01:01:01.079]  And now, Tom Arnold has come out and called Candace Owens to suck racist you-know-what.
[01:01:01.139 --> 01:01:03.360]  So she can say something sexist to a woman,
[01:01:04.684 --> 01:01:05.304]  Very brutal.
[01:01:08.185 --> 01:01:10.986]  And it's okay, as long as she's a conservative.
[01:01:12.987 --> 01:01:15.828]  I know Tom Arnold talks about how he wants to kick my butt and stuff like that.
[01:01:15.888 --> 01:01:19.850]  What a bobblehead, shell-out, narcissist demon.
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.071]  He's who you don't want to be.
[01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:25.052]  Candace Owens is who you want to be.
[01:01:29.674 --> 01:01:30.214]  Tom Arnold.
[01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:32.335]  What a joke.
[01:01:36.517 --> 01:01:40.059]  And, you know, I didn't get to this Hillary thing, but just remember Comey?
[01:01:41.439 --> 01:01:50.204]  He told Congress that he reopened the investigation to Hillary's servers because he thought it was the lesser of two evils.
[01:01:51.364 --> 01:01:52.765]  And then he closed it a few days later.
[01:01:53.145 --> 01:02:03.230]  It was all because they wanted to be able to say they'd reviewed it because Eric Prince and others, actually Doug Hagman, revealed it a day before Prince.
[01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.691]  And I'm not keeping scores, it's a fact.
[01:02:07.112 --> 01:02:07.792]  That's why they hate us.
[01:02:08.633 --> 01:02:15.520]  That Eric Prince said that his sources said that they had a copy of the hard drive.
[01:02:15.841 --> 01:02:18.884]  That's why they finally then had to go after him and indict Wiener.
[01:02:20.305 --> 01:02:21.707]  So that's all the stuff that's going on.
[01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:26.492]  And you got Hillary at Penn State, the pedophile command base.
[01:02:28.502 --> 01:02:33.965]  Sitting up there talking about how, oh, Trump's mean to the media, and Trump's mean, and he's... No, they're attacking him.
[01:02:34.386 --> 01:02:36.847]  They're calling for shutting down conservative libertarian speech everywhere.
[01:02:37.147 --> 01:02:39.088]  Hillary is calling for it in the speech.
[01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:42.230]  Meanwhile, comic legend Mel Brooks denounces political correctness.
[01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:48.974]  I think it's only a sliver that really love political correctness.
[01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:51.496]  Everybody else likes the truth, which is different.
[01:02:55.046 --> 01:02:57.067]  Mel Brooks gets it, but see, that's the tyranny.
[01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.467]  Meanwhile, Hillary wants your free speech.
[01:03:00.648 --> 01:03:02.268]  It's all on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:06.310]  And Kanye West has gone public saying, we need to come out of the plantation.
[01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:11.792]  We need to understand that we need to have thought rights.
[01:03:13.012 --> 01:03:16.353]  They got free speech, just not thought rights.
[01:03:17.013 --> 01:03:17.774]  What's the exact quote?
[01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:18.534]  I've got one of them here.
[01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:21.155]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:03:23.485 --> 01:03:25.527]  But let's go out to break with some of Hillary.
[01:03:25.547 --> 01:03:25.908]  Here it is.
[01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:33.275]  And he has repeatedly threatened Amazon because Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.
[01:03:34.256 --> 01:03:41.343]  A newspaper defying the odds and showing what many thought was a dying business model can be a success.
[01:03:42.564 --> 01:03:46.828]  For anyone who thinks our country isn't vulnerable to propaganda,
[01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:53.867]  ...or attempts to suppress free expression, you only have to look at the 2016 election... Stop again!
[01:03:54.067 --> 01:04:06.818]  ...which was a... Where Google and Twitter and Facebook, all on record, the WikiLeaks show, gamed everything for you, rigged the debates, gave you all the questions beforehand, fake polls, fake town halls with actors, that's all admitted!
[01:04:07.158 --> 01:04:10.942]  And you want to change the subject, and she has behind her... Put the video up again, please.
[01:04:11.382 --> 01:04:12.683]  If you're a TV viewer, I want to show people this.
[01:04:13.464 --> 01:04:15.966]  The Penn State says the freedom to write
[01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:23.577]  It's the EU, it's the globalists, it's the UN that's trying to take the individual's right to write and to speak and to assemble.
[01:04:23.857 --> 01:04:28.761]  But she sits up there, this authoritarian witch, arrogantly, in front of all these people.
[01:04:32.384 --> 01:04:32.524]  Ms.
[01:04:32.544 --> 01:04:40.050]  Clinton gave the Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture at PEN America's World Voice Festival in New York City.
[01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.013]  What a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:45.155]  Truly sickening.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.882]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:53.047]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:53.668 --> 01:04:54.709]  Those are the sites they hate.
[01:04:55.169 --> 01:04:56.370]  Those are the sites they dread.
[01:04:56.851 --> 01:05:01.115]  The live feeds, the podcasts, the videos, all of it is kryptonite to these demons.
[01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:02.737]  All of it is sunlight to vampires.
[01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.651]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:05:11.691 --> 01:05:12.212]  You're on the air.
[01:05:12.232 --> 01:05:13.392]  Thanks for holding.
[01:05:13.472 --> 01:05:14.233]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:15.073]  Hey, brother.
[01:05:15.353 --> 01:05:15.733]  Good, man.
[01:05:15.753 --> 01:05:16.574]  Thank you for calling.
[01:05:16.634 --> 01:05:17.174]  Hey, hey.
[01:05:17.294 --> 01:05:21.696]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:28.299]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:05:28.419 --> 01:05:30.120]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:36.383]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:05:37.523 --> 01:05:38.644]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:41.145]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:05:41.185 --> 01:05:42.706]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:05:43.087 --> 01:05:44.748]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:05:45.148 --> 01:05:45.888]  And exactly.
[01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:50.171]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:50.771]  Boom!
[01:05:50.912 --> 01:05:53.753]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:05:53.813 --> 01:05:54.334]  It's amazing.
[01:05:54.394 --> 01:05:55.675]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:05:55.755 --> 01:05:58.617]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:11.253]  Another world.
[01:06:11.694 --> 01:06:13.758]  Another time.
[01:06:13.778 --> 01:06:16.423]  In the age of wonder.
[01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:49.803]  So, Kanye West has come under fire.
[01:06:51.024 --> 01:06:55.945]  Blasting Thought Police after he's attacked for endorsing conservative commentator.
[01:06:56.685 --> 01:06:58.706]  We have freedom of speech, but not freedom
[01:06:59.967 --> 01:07:00.628]  All right.
[01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:46.506]  Kanye West Tweets Admired Controversial YouTuber Candace Owens Sparks Angry Backlash And Accusations That He Is A Black Donald Trump How Dare Him Talk About This Woman That Feminist Groups Contacted And Tried To Bully And That Had Groups Harass Her Posing As Conservatives So They Could Try To Take Control Of Her Media Organization How Dare Him Stand Up For Her Meanwhile I Was Getting Into Hillary Clinton
[01:07:48.114 --> 01:08:01.221]  We're gonna get back into that, but Tom Arnold has come out in a monstrous attack on Candace Owens and said, you need to suck racist you-know-what's.
[01:08:01.261 --> 01:08:08.785]  You can make a sexually violent, you know, aggressive thing towards a woman, but only if you're a leftist.
[01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:11.287]  They can do whatever comedy they want.
[01:08:11.467 --> 01:08:12.367]  They can say whatever they want.
[01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:13.368]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:15.289]  It's okay.
[01:08:16.903 --> 01:08:19.368]  One correction here I need to make that I just noticed.
[01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:29.807]  I was watching this Hillary video this morning on Infowars.com, Steve Watson article about it, and it had like what looked like Independence Hall when they showed the side shot.
[01:08:31.246 --> 01:08:32.807]  You can find that on the video for TV viewers.
[01:08:32.827 --> 01:08:34.849]  There's a shot where it's a side shot on the video.
[01:08:34.909 --> 01:08:35.710]  I know I watched this morning.
[01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.531]  You know, not the frontal shot in the video.
[01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:38.212]  It's a side shot.
[01:08:38.232 --> 01:08:39.793]  I mean, it's like Independence Hall.
[01:08:39.813 --> 01:08:42.456]  It looks like Independence Hall and it says Penn and all that.
[01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:45.078]  And I knew that she was a big buddy with Penn State and speaks there a lot.
[01:08:45.098 --> 01:08:53.986]  So I said, look at her speaking at Penn State, you know, where they had all the big problems and the compromise and the president arrested for covering up the pedophilia and Sandusky and all of it.
[01:08:54.406 --> 01:08:57.208]  And then I realized, I said, let me look into that where she was speaking.
[01:08:57.248 --> 01:08:59.790]  It's PEN America, not associated with that.
[01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:07.835]  PEN America, a journal for writers and readers, is an annual literary journal that features fiction, poetry, conversation, criticism, memoir.
[01:09:08.295 --> 01:09:09.896]  So no affiliation with Penn State.
[01:09:10.277 --> 01:09:17.281]  But I noticed, I'm just saying this, they've got a lady there in a group that's about the freedom to write and free speech was laudable by PEN America.
[01:09:17.561 --> 01:09:22.044]  So good for them and their slogan, which was really blowing me away.
[01:09:22.064 --> 01:09:23.225]  I thought, does Penn State have that logo?
[01:09:23.245 --> 01:09:24.126]  I thought it's something else.
[01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:26.708]  I thought it was like a part of Penn State.
[01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:33.315]  So, you know, the point is here she is anti-free speech saying get rid of free speech.
[01:09:34.577 --> 01:09:40.159]  In the name of protecting free speech, in her speech, it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:45.020]  So back her speech up to the beginning, because I want to play this in context.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:52.622]  This is really, really out of control, ladies and gentlemen, that everything she says is exactly what they're actually doing.
[01:09:53.082 --> 01:09:59.304]  And then these big monopolies that get taxpayer money like Amazon, Google, Twitter, Facebook, that are caught doing all these horrible things, working with the Democrats,
[01:09:59.924 --> 01:10:02.646]  She wants a total ban on conservatives, libertarians, you name it.
[01:10:02.726 --> 01:10:03.607]  Europe's already doing it.
[01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:07.670]  And then she spins that and speaks at a pro-free speech group.
[01:10:09.912 --> 01:10:10.713]  It's just incredible.
[01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:17.698]  So my, uh, conflating those two things, I apologize to PEN America for getting that wrong.
[01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:21.361]  But I do want to ask PEN America, are you going to say something about her being so anti-free speech saying this?
[01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:27.046]  Let's go ahead and roll that video of her speaking.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:39.663]  For anyone who thinks our country isn't vulnerable to propaganda or attempts to suppress free expression, you only have to look at the 2016 election.
[01:10:39.863 --> 01:10:40.203]  Stop it!
[01:10:40.443 --> 01:10:40.884]  Stop it!
[01:10:41.024 --> 01:10:41.344]  Stop it!
[01:10:41.924 --> 01:10:44.285]  I think we missed this in the fog of battle.
[01:10:46.205 --> 01:10:47.726]  We'll back the tape up to the beginning.
[01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:49.626]  So, we got it backed up?
[01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:51.707]  Okay, here it is.
[01:10:53.342 --> 01:10:59.425]  Well today, we have a president who seems to reject the role of a free press in our democracy.
[01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:13.932]  Although obsessed with his own press coverage, he evaluates it based not on whether it provides knowledge or understanding, but solely on whether the daily coverage helps him and hurts his opponents.
[01:11:15.133 --> 01:11:18.975]  He has referred to the media as an enemy of the people.
[01:11:20.029 --> 01:11:25.293]  He has suggested that broadcast licenses of some news networks should be challenged.
[01:11:26.274 --> 01:11:30.658]  He wants to block the sale of CNN to AT&T for the same reason.
[01:11:31.659 --> 01:11:45.991]  And he has repeatedly threatened Amazon because Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper defying the odds and showing what many thought was a dying business model can be a success.
[01:11:47.278 --> 01:11:52.762]  For anyone who thinks our country isn't vulnerable to propaganda... You know, let's stop again right there.
[01:11:52.782 --> 01:11:53.582]  Hold on.
[01:11:54.603 --> 01:12:01.928]  Bezos is showing us that newspapers can be profitable again when the New York Times and all of these groups are running at a loss.
[01:12:02.309 --> 01:12:03.750]  They made a little bit of money during the election.
[01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:05.491]  They were totally imploding, going bankrupt.
[01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:06.632]  They made a little bit of money during the election.
[01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:08.093]  They're all in free fall again.
[01:12:08.313 --> 01:12:09.354]  That's another lie.
[01:12:09.574 --> 01:12:12.296]  Everything she does is to prop up the establishment.
[01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:22.326]  Bezos is putting hundreds of millions a year into that organization and making staff cuts and taking their benefits because he's a good liberal and they love abuse.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.541]  And then she says there are lies about that.
[01:12:24.561 --> 01:12:24.881]  Continue.
[01:12:45.817 --> 01:12:52.562]  Hillary, what you always do is take things out of context, or we do devil's advocate, or we correct something, then you spin it.
[01:12:53.022 --> 01:13:03.469]  You're a known liar who had weaponized media against the American people, the same Google, Twitter, Facebook that the Arab Spring was influenced with in your own words.
[01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:09.773]  So again, let's continue.
[01:13:11.874 --> 01:13:13.576]  Hillary's speech from yesterday.
[01:13:13.597 --> 01:13:13.797]  Here it is.
[01:13:13.817 --> 01:13:14.999]  I still am trying to figure that one out.
[01:13:30.049 --> 01:13:44.895]  But they use these very well-trafficked sites to place targeted attack ads and negative stories, intended not only to hurt me, but more importantly and lastingly, to fan the flames of division within.
[01:13:45.695 --> 01:13:46.556]  Our society.
[01:13:46.576 --> 01:13:47.076]  Stop again.
[01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:54.522]  I want to take this speech and then take the WikiLeaks and emails to her and emails she's sending about how do we create division?
[01:13:54.843 --> 01:13:55.723]  I hate my supporters.
[01:13:55.743 --> 01:13:56.984]  They're dumb people and baristas.
[01:13:57.365 --> 01:13:59.666]  How do we fan the flames of cultural war?
[01:14:00.127 --> 01:14:01.408]  That's what the left does.
[01:14:01.468 --> 01:14:03.610]  It's come out in document after document.
[01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:12.297]  Soros documents came out a few months ago where they wanted to cause martial law in Maryland in 2015 to keep Obama in office and tried to cause race war.
[01:14:13.513 --> 01:14:15.673]  Again, I can't listen anymore, but that's enough of her.
[01:14:17.594 --> 01:14:21.354]  When we come back, Zach is a great military intelligence source.
[01:14:22.535 --> 01:14:25.715]  He's now in another area of the government slash private industry.
[01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:29.396]  He's been on TV, he's been on the radio before, he's been in print.
[01:14:30.036 --> 01:14:30.896]  His name is Zach.
[01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:31.696]  The government knows who he is.
[01:14:31.716 --> 01:14:40.098]  He's been picked up by the FBI twice, threatening him that he better not tell any secrets on air, when all he's doing is giving you views as a citizen who understands this stuff.
[01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:46.903]  He got picked up again and he is a brave person today in the San Francisco airport.
[01:14:46.923 --> 01:14:57.428]  We've not had contact with him in over 30 minutes and I've got all of his text messages here relayed via the producer to my phone and I'm going to go over what happened to him on the other side.
[01:14:57.828 --> 01:14:59.129]  He was going to be joining us.
[01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:00.330]  I had some other guests I canceled.
[01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:02.911]  He was going to be joining us in the third hour today.
[01:15:03.351 --> 01:15:08.673]  He was on yesterday and laid out plans by the Globalist to launch false flags.
[01:15:11.047 --> 01:15:14.969]  In this country to blame Trump and try to destabilize everything.
[01:15:15.249 --> 01:15:16.850]  False flags aimed at the left.
[01:15:18.171 --> 01:15:19.252]  Obviously that's the next move.
[01:15:20.272 --> 01:15:23.614]  And then I have other sources basically saying the same things including high-level CIA.
[01:15:24.695 --> 01:15:30.138]  And so continually it's the FBI in certain leftist offices like San Francisco you notice.
[01:15:31.832 --> 01:15:33.133]  Uh, that just made their move.
[01:15:33.453 --> 01:15:47.818]  And of course now, Al-Qaeda and ISIS that have been supported by CNN and others, in the Arab Spring, they now have, you know, videos and propaganda out that they're gonna attack the Federal Reserve, the CNN, the UN, to make it look like when those attacks come that those are good organizations, because, oh look, ISIS attacked them.
[01:15:49.059 --> 01:15:50.839]  So, uh, that's what's going on.
[01:15:50.899 --> 01:15:53.180]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.702]  We're in a fight, a civil war, for the future of this country.
[01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:57.642]  Please stay with us.
[01:15:57.722 --> 01:15:59.423]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:02.528]  Bake!
[01:16:06.019 --> 01:16:08.501]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[01:16:08.601 --> 01:16:11.664]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[01:16:11.724 --> 01:16:14.566]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:16.087]  What is the latest from the UK?
[01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:24.774]  Look, remember in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[01:16:24.794 --> 01:16:28.977]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[01:16:28.997 --> 01:16:31.900]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.321]  It would have been mad!
[01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:41.603]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[01:16:41.643 --> 01:16:44.044]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[01:16:44.624 --> 01:16:46.364]  Trust Middle England.
[01:16:46.784 --> 01:16:48.225]  Trust Middle America.
[01:16:48.245 --> 01:16:52.046]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[01:16:52.366 --> 01:16:56.247]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[01:16:56.787 --> 01:16:57.687]  All I can tell her
[01:16:58.467 --> 01:17:07.053]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[01:17:07.073 --> 01:17:08.134]  Let's put it like this.
[01:17:08.675 --> 01:17:17.541]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:23.383]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[01:17:23.824 --> 01:17:36.649]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[01:17:36.689 --> 01:17:38.850]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.091]  You're a leading expert on this.
[01:17:40.171 --> 01:17:42.031]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:43.272]  Why are they trying to flood?
[01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:45.438]  Because they hate Christianity.
[01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:57.062]  They can't, I mean, you know, they deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[01:17:57.102 --> 01:17:57.923]  They deny that.
[01:17:58.363 --> 01:18:02.004]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[01:18:02.084 --> 01:18:03.264]  They want to get rid of it.
[01:18:03.765 --> 01:18:11.707]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:13.768]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.721]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:25.783]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:34.345]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[01:18:34.385 --> 01:18:40.127]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[01:18:40.167 --> 01:18:41.327]  And look, what's really happening here?
[01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:43.668]  You know, don't underestimate
[01:18:44.268 --> 01:18:47.210]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:48.631]  The victory of Brexit.
[01:18:48.911 --> 01:18:49.832]  The victory of Trump.
[01:18:50.452 --> 01:18:51.293]  You know, we're winning.
[01:18:51.633 --> 01:18:52.713]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[01:18:52.954 --> 01:19:00.578]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[01:19:00.658 --> 01:19:01.459]  And you know something?
[01:19:01.999 --> 01:19:02.800]  If we can resist,
[01:19:03.587 --> 01:19:12.717]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[01:19:12.757 --> 01:19:14.499]  So don't get down, everybody.
[01:19:14.779 --> 01:19:15.640]  Don't get depressed.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.483]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:28.211]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:29.132]  You're amazing.
[01:19:29.373 --> 01:19:30.054]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:30.915]  I know you're very busy.
[01:19:31.495 --> 01:19:32.857]  But that's as the EU has said.
[01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:35.380]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.804]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:52.712]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[01:19:53.072 --> 01:19:58.537]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[01:19:59.018 --> 01:20:00.359]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:08.873]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.274 --> 01:20:34.327]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:36.692]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:54.318 --> 01:21:08.006]  All right, we were going to have Zach on, who is a great intelligence source and worked in many different areas of the government, not to give us anything secret, but to give his research an intelligent view on what's happening politically in the country.
[01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:15.471]  Now, yesterday he got into false flags being planned against leftist organizations here in the country to make them even more
[01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:24.608]  Victims in everybody's eyes so they can run around and call for conservative and libertarian and pro-Trump media to be banned because they're poor dear sweet little victims.
[01:21:26.584 --> 01:21:41.278]  Well, this came in at 1045 and then I just go through the text messages until he went silent about 45 minutes ago at the San Francisco International Airport where he was preparing to fly out to Dubai on one of his missions.
[01:21:41.978 --> 01:21:43.560]  And he's declared national security.
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.761]  The FBI, the police are there.
[01:21:44.801 --> 01:21:45.962]  They're trying to get his hard drives.
[01:21:46.523 --> 01:21:48.885]  As of the times, they apparently took his cell phone.
[01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:49.466]  He went dark.
[01:21:50.086 --> 01:21:51.467]  He's been picked up twice before.
[01:21:52.488 --> 01:21:54.269]  Um, and taken into the military base.
[01:21:54.689 --> 01:21:58.351]  Well, once he was picked up, taken to the FBI, another time into CENTCOM.
[01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:04.013]  And then they just go over his hard drives, everything, to make sure he, quote, doesn't have anything classified.
[01:22:04.033 --> 01:22:11.597]  They're trying to threaten him to quit speaking, even though his job is something that he's allowed to have those things, but it has nothing to do with what he's saying on air.
[01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:22.905]  He got visited last week in Palo Alto to look at what he was doing by the FBI, even though it's within his job and he's supported by the group he's with.
[01:22:31.232 --> 01:22:37.295]  They are claiming an issue with external hard drives in one of my security team carry-on bags.
[01:22:38.195 --> 01:22:40.697]  Legal team en route from San Jose.
[01:22:41.337 --> 01:22:45.559]  Word of words between everyone here, we won't unlock the hard drives.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:47.940]  Demanding a warrant.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.981]  Intimidation at its finest.
[01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:50.822]  This was planned.
[01:22:52.122 --> 01:22:56.604]  I am en route to Dubai and have had flights scheduled for over a week.
[01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:59.706]  Not the first time they've used TSA like this with me.
[01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.231]  All is on the up and up and I'll be good.
[01:23:03.732 --> 01:23:07.695]  I intend to eat breakfast then do an interview as scheduled once the terminal.
[01:23:08.136 --> 01:23:10.198]  I will keep you updated as this unfolds.
[01:23:10.578 --> 01:23:13.141]  We obviously razzled them on yesterday's show.
[01:23:17.265 --> 01:23:18.126]  We will keep you updated.
[01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:19.347]  Attorneys arriving very shortly.
[01:23:20.448 --> 01:23:22.911]  Doing all we can to to make the flight.
[01:23:23.371 --> 01:23:24.072]  We'll get booked.
[01:23:24.492 --> 01:23:25.073]  Big meetings.
[01:23:27.324 --> 01:23:27.965]  Can't say the rest.
[01:23:28.506 --> 01:23:29.267]  And then it goes on.
[01:23:29.287 --> 01:23:30.109]  I know what it says.
[01:23:30.129 --> 01:23:30.930]  I'm not going to say it on air.
[01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:31.170]  Thanks.
[01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:35.458]  Attorneys and local law enforcement going at it right now.
[01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:36.700]  This is complete BS.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.222]  FBI has now...
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.281]  Thanks, guys.
[01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:41.442]  I know what it says.
[01:23:41.502 --> 01:23:42.963]  I'm not going to read that on there.
[01:24:08.215 --> 01:24:17.141]  Anyways, so... That's what's going on in this country to intimidate free speech.
[01:24:17.941 --> 01:24:23.425]  And meanwhile, Hillary's at a free speech group talking about how we need to shut down free speech in the country.
[01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:29.249]  Simply mind-blowing that this type of stuff goes on.
[01:24:29.769 --> 01:24:33.652]  And it gives me a headache to sit there and see it all unfold this way.
[01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:35.813]  But it's a fight.
[01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:37.074]  It's a war.
[01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:38.458]  It's on.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.361]  Now, we have not heard back from Zach, so we don't really know what happened to him.
[01:24:44.342 --> 01:24:51.066]  But, I think it's time for Zach to come on air, and he's one of many, many sources I have, but he's been a really good source.
[01:24:51.967 --> 01:25:02.374]  I noticed that all these so-called mainstream media outlets, the day after the Vegas attack, said Jones just claimed on his phone that some random tip
[01:25:03.823 --> 01:25:08.665]  Told him that the Vegas shooter was connected to gun running and the Middle East and all the rest of this.
[01:25:10.466 --> 01:25:27.733]  I was told face-to-face in the morning what was going on, but was told to hold off till our source, face-to-face, who's worked for the CIA, you name it, got the go-ahead.
[01:25:29.294 --> 01:25:32.716]  I then got texted the green light with what had been relayed
[01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:34.870]  To him, to read it on air.
[01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:39.051]  I didn't read all of it on air, because I thought some of it was not good to read on air.
[01:25:40.332 --> 01:25:43.813]  The media just goes, oh, Jones claims a source just randomly texted him.
[01:25:43.853 --> 01:25:46.134]  No, it wasn't a source just randomly texting me.
[01:25:47.155 --> 01:25:56.779]  It was somebody who, at 6.30 in the morning, had been in my kitchen eating breakfast with me, on the phone with the FBI hostage rescue team.
[01:25:57.079 --> 01:25:59.380]  You think they're a little pissed off that we have those sources?
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:25:59.880]  Yeah.
[01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:02.101]  They said, hold off.
[01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:14.395]  At 8 in the morning, after I was briefed on what was going on, you'll be given what you can say, if you choose to go with it, when we text you.
[01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:15.255]  Boom!
[01:26:15.335 --> 01:26:22.818]  Get the text, I read it, and the media spins it like I'm just sitting there making all of this up.
[01:26:23.598 --> 01:26:24.178]  That's what they do.
[01:26:24.198 --> 01:26:25.959]  Because they make stuff up all day.
[01:26:26.259 --> 01:26:28.219]  They have fake sources, they have all this fake garbage.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.320]  What came out later?
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.441]  Saudi Arabia, a big event was happening there with the military.
[01:26:33.604 --> 01:26:44.690]  A conference, he was connected to gun running, they came in, he thought it was a gun running operation, they killed him, set him up, shot everything up, civil war, as a message to Trump, as a message to where he makes money, hotels, entertainment casinos.
[01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:53.294]  It was a leftist hotel, the very floor was owned by the Crown Prince, who now has turned against the Globals, reportedly on the surface.
[01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.435]  And I already had all that intel.
[01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:58.017]  And Zach had the same intel and more.
[01:26:58.497 --> 01:27:00.258]  And Zach's just somebody that's willing to go on air.
[01:27:02.947 --> 01:27:05.588]  Because one faction has told him, you do it, we'll back you.
[01:27:05.908 --> 01:27:07.749]  The other faction is really going after him.
[01:27:08.009 --> 01:27:09.450]  This is big boy stuff.
[01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.591]  This is the real world.
[01:27:14.132 --> 01:27:17.193]  And he's bucking and so are my other sources that Sessions is good.
[01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:19.134]  Sessions is compromised, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:21.054 --> 01:27:24.736]  And QAnon keeps saying, oh no, you know, it's going to be good.
[01:27:24.756 --> 01:27:26.317]  Well, QAnon is not the end-all be-all.
[01:27:26.557 --> 01:27:31.519]  That's just another group of people that are, we think, patriots, but I, you know.
[01:27:32.287 --> 01:27:42.931]  Carl Rove was on Fox this morning going, Trump doesn't have any Russian collusion, we need to leave Mueller and Rosenstein and everybody there, stop acting guilty, you know, blah blah blah, we need to find out how the Russians control the election though.
[01:27:43.212 --> 01:27:44.532]  That's another hoax he pushes.
[01:27:44.752 --> 01:27:49.434]  And no discussion from Carl Rove in two segments on Fox while I was on the elliptical this morning.
[01:27:51.095 --> 01:27:53.436]  No discussion from Carl Rove.
[01:27:54.935 --> 01:28:04.159]  About Hillary, and the WikiLeaks, and the crimes, and the Russians, and Uranium One, and the globalists, and the Chinese communists, and the infiltration, and the secret servers.
[01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:05.219]  Never any of that!
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.001]  Just Trump better leave Mueller alone.
[01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:08.861]  He's a Boy Scout.
[01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.402]  No, Mueller and Comey aren't Boy Scouts.
[01:28:12.523 --> 01:28:13.183]  They're globalists.
[01:28:13.783 --> 01:28:14.603]  They're scumbags.
[01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:16.184]  They're out of control.
[01:28:16.944 --> 01:28:18.105]  They're covering up for the Clintons.
[01:28:19.185 --> 01:28:22.507]  And so I'm not scared of their ever-widening fake investigation.
[01:28:23.462 --> 01:28:25.263]  Now into Stormy Daniels and raiding his lawyer.
[01:28:25.403 --> 01:28:34.708]  I'm scared of them being out of control and a fifth branch of government that thinks it's God with this evil globalist anti-free speech media trying to stop an American recovery!
[01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.470]  The globalists are American haters.
[01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:39.751]  They've been recruited because they are.
[01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:40.772]  They're our enemies.
[01:28:43.713 --> 01:28:46.555]  And after two years of a witch hunt, nothing's been found so they're expanding it.
[01:28:47.679 --> 01:28:53.825]  Karl Rove needs to go back to his normal business of getting into the Republican money and making sure it doesn't go to any good use, so he can buy more big houses.
[01:28:55.206 --> 01:29:00.491]  Stick a fork in Turd Blossom, he was done the day George W. crapped him into a toilet bowl.
[01:29:02.222 --> 01:29:06.726]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:51.266]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[01:29:51.526 --> 01:29:54.848]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[01:29:55.148 --> 01:30:00.051]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:00.131 --> 01:30:02.032]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:11.727]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their hammerlock, their complete monopoly on political discourse in this country.
[01:30:12.047 --> 01:30:23.611]  Donald Trump's election, in fact the entire sea change in American politics, was only made possible through a robust and vibrant alternative media allowed through an unfettered internet.
[01:30:23.931 --> 01:30:43.796]  This is not only about the 2016 and 2020 elections, it's about the slow motion coup that's going on in this country, where a fabricated dossier can be used to justify legally the illegal surveillance, the unconstitutional surveillance on the Republican candidate for President of the United States.
[01:30:44.056 --> 01:30:52.242]  But you see, those who are the perps in that crime don't want any discussion of that crime in the mainstream or the alternative media.
[01:30:52.302 --> 01:31:00.067]  And that is why they seek, through a very, I think, duplicitous strategy of lawfare,
[01:31:01.008 --> 01:31:03.531]  And censorship to shut us down.
[01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:15.525]  The key to this, of course, is the lawsuits, and I'm facing one from an Obama-blessed front-call project, Democracy, who are suing me and Donald Trump.
[01:31:15.805 --> 01:31:20.130]  The allegation being that we worked with the Russians to hack
[01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:24.693]  Uh, the Democratic National Committee and give that material to WikiLeaks.
[01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:30.797]  That is as unprovable in a court of law as it will be unprovable in the court of public opinion.
[01:31:31.057 --> 01:31:32.638]  Because it's a fairy tale.
[01:31:33.139 --> 01:31:33.939]  A falsehood.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:35.240]  A lie.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.481]  A canard.
[01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:39.183]  A steaming plate of, well, you know.
[01:31:40.243 --> 01:31:59.706]  The point here, of course, is that if they can silence us, if they can take us off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, it becomes much easier to drive their false narrative about the 2016 election, their false narrative about the unconstitutional activities going on today,
[01:32:00.186 --> 01:32:13.503]  Whether it is raiding Donald Trump's lawyer's office or whether it is the illegal surveillance of the Republican candidate for president under FISA warrants that were fabricated in their rationale, fabricated in their purpose.
[01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:16.628]  And then, of course, there's the Second Amendment.
[01:32:17.308 --> 01:32:21.653]  Silence us before you attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights.
[01:32:22.194 --> 01:32:22.974]  This is a struggle.
[01:32:23.195 --> 01:32:25.858]  This is the single most important struggle.
[01:32:26.278 --> 01:32:26.578]  Why?
[01:32:26.638 --> 01:32:35.168]  Because without our voice, all other issues, trade, immigration, the economy, we are at an enormous disadvantage.
[01:32:35.588 --> 01:32:38.812]  The real story here is that the American left
[01:32:39.292 --> 01:32:41.873]  No longer is interested in dialogue or debate.
[01:32:42.374 --> 01:32:43.874]  They can't win a debate.
[01:32:44.275 --> 01:32:45.595]  They don't want a debate.
[01:32:45.895 --> 01:32:47.736]  They don't want a discussion of issues.
[01:32:48.077 --> 01:32:54.780]  Their answer, when we raise facts and arguments, is silence them, censor them, close them down.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.861]  That's why you know they have lost.
[01:32:58.362 --> 01:32:58.702]  Thank you.
[01:33:06.354 --> 01:33:09.056]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.665 --> 01:33:29.395]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.673 --> 01:33:46.956]  Alright, Zach, with his security detail, going to Dubai.
[01:33:47.316 --> 01:33:48.376]  Very busy fellow.
[01:33:48.396 --> 01:33:52.218]  And when his identity comes out, people are going to go, wow.
[01:33:52.639 --> 01:33:54.419]  Because this guy was in the news ten years ago.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:55.980]  And five years ago.
[01:33:56.841 --> 01:34:01.823]  I mean, he's run operations, and he's been a patriot that stands up and speaks out.
[01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:03.004]  It's like Tosh Plumlee.
[01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:07.101]  Now at, what, 80-something years old, he's now right at 80.
[01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:09.342]  He's retired to South America for his safety.
[01:34:09.942 --> 01:34:10.743]  They were trying to kill him.
[01:34:11.503 --> 01:34:16.526]  Tosh Plumlee was the main church committee witness, and then he was the main witness on Iran-Contra.
[01:34:17.827 --> 01:34:19.908]  And then he was friends with El Chapo.
[01:34:20.028 --> 01:34:21.249]  I mean, he's a living legend.
[01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:25.431]  Had him on air, listeners, most of them didn't get what was happening.
[01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:27.493]  He exposed the whole Benghazi deal.
[01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:29.574]  He blew the whole thing wide open first here.
[01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:33.932]  And I can't tell you the things they did to him.
[01:34:34.893 --> 01:34:36.873]  He is now left to South America.
[01:34:42.996 --> 01:34:44.076]  And it's the same thing.
[01:34:44.617 --> 01:34:50.219]  Tosh Plumlee was friends with Fidel Castro and flew him his first guns in the late 50s.
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.241]  He was still flying missions in his late 70s.
[01:34:56.641 --> 01:34:57.962]  And then three years ago, retired.
[01:35:02.967 --> 01:35:04.348]  Alright, we just got a hold of Zach.
[01:35:04.408 --> 01:35:05.909]  They just gave him his cell phone back.
[01:35:05.969 --> 01:35:08.832]  He will be out of the detention area, he says, in 10 minutes.
[01:35:09.272 --> 01:35:16.097]  And will exclusively be on for only a few, but they may already miss their flight to Dubai, so we'll see what happens.
[01:35:17.619 --> 01:35:19.240]  So, I've got that information coming in.
[01:35:27.008 --> 01:35:30.610]  You know, if America knew how real this was, we would fix this so quickly.
[01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:38.634]  But they put out all this background BS, all this background garbage, and then people don't know what's really real.
[01:35:42.816 --> 01:35:52.622]  And then they'll take real issues we're covering, but then a mistake about how we covered it and make it all about that instead of the whole larger enchilada.
[01:35:53.502 --> 01:35:54.163]  And play games.
[01:35:54.263 --> 01:35:56.164]  But they fear us because they fear you.
[01:35:56.505 --> 01:35:57.445]  They fear free speech.
[01:35:57.485 --> 01:35:59.387]  And they believe if they can shut InfoWars down, they win.
[01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:01.809]  Now here's the deal.
[01:36:01.929 --> 01:36:03.050]  I had other guests coming on.
[01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.411]  I've cleaned the boards off.
[01:36:04.631 --> 01:36:05.612]  Zach was going to be on next hour.
[01:36:05.632 --> 01:36:07.734]  He can only be on for a few minutes next segment if he gets through.
[01:36:07.754 --> 01:36:10.636]  So we're going to have open phones in the third hour.
[01:36:12.498 --> 01:36:15.941]  Then in the fourth hour, Lionel always does a great job.
[01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:16.621]  He's going to be on.
[01:36:20.464 --> 01:36:22.066]  Paul Watson's going to come on Friday.
[01:36:23.865 --> 01:36:25.806]  Because people are so interested in it and he's so private.
[01:36:26.787 --> 01:36:31.410]  And since they have all these fake news articles out about Paul, he's not going to respond to their lies specifically.
[01:36:32.771 --> 01:36:37.914]  But we're going to talk about the 10 biggest stories he's ever broken and been part of for the first half of an hour.
[01:36:38.014 --> 01:36:47.661]  And the second half, we're going to talk about Paul Watson and his awakening and how he has, let's not exaggerate, 50 million fans.
[01:36:49.202 --> 01:36:52.684]  And how the globalists are obsessed with him if he would really take it to the next level.
[01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:56.988]  And what it's really been like behind the scenes.
[01:37:00.271 --> 01:37:04.755]  Alex Jones protégé Paul Watson is about to steal his crackpot crown.
[01:37:08.798 --> 01:37:12.001]  I mean, the articles of manipulation try to cause trouble in my office.
[01:37:12.501 --> 01:37:15.724]  And the dream of getting Paul to not work with us.
[01:37:16.905 --> 01:37:21.388]  And the idea that Paul wasn't supporting Trump early on, but Jones was.
[01:37:21.689 --> 01:37:24.291]  But then Jones threatened him, sources say.
[01:37:29.395 --> 01:37:32.438]  I don't tell people that I hire and I trust what to say.
[01:37:33.819 --> 01:37:35.440]  Jakari Jackson didn't like Trump.
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.442]  He talked about it all the time.
[01:37:37.742 --> 01:37:38.783]  He'd been here four years.
[01:37:39.143 --> 01:37:40.004]  He's a classy guy.
[01:37:41.425 --> 01:37:43.006]  He said, I'm gonna go do comic books.
[01:37:43.026 --> 01:37:43.627]  It's been great.
[01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:45.368]  Vaya Con Dios.
[01:37:45.548 --> 01:37:46.489]  That's a classy guy.
[01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:53.395]  No one here has been told what to say or what to do.
[01:37:53.435 --> 01:37:55.517]  They've just been told, try to get your facts as good as you can.
[01:37:55.577 --> 01:37:57.138]  If you make a mistake, retract it immediately.
[01:38:00.435 --> 01:38:07.320]  But you just read this stuff and it's like, Jones paid Watson what people were paid in a year.
[01:38:09.881 --> 01:38:10.302]  A month.
[01:38:11.662 --> 01:38:14.384]  People are paid $5,000 a year?
[01:38:18.687 --> 01:38:20.588]  Paul was paid nothing the first two years he was here.
[01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:25.432]  Then he was paid a couple thousand a month.
[01:38:27.033 --> 01:38:35.595]  And then up to, like, I don't get his private stuff, but I mean, then he hired his brother, and I was paying him 10 grand a month for him and his brother in London.
[01:38:35.655 --> 01:38:36.895]  That is, I mean, you know.
[01:38:38.375 --> 01:38:42.316]  I mean, and I pay Paul a little bit more now, but my goodness, he deserves more.
[01:38:42.376 --> 01:38:53.438]  I mean, he's a great journalist that works 16 hours a day, and you just read these total fiction things, and they assault everyone you know, your family, people that work for you.
[01:38:53.478 --> 01:38:54.438]  They tell lies.
[01:38:54.578 --> 01:38:55.698]  It's just crazy.
[01:38:56.547 --> 01:38:57.487]  But you know what they're gonna do?
[01:38:59.128 --> 01:39:12.010]  I've got Paul this close to opening a London bureau and organizing other talk show hosts and a bunch of other stuff and I think I think them harassing him has got him ready because they're so scared he spreads his wings.
[01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:19.132]  They write the article like I'm keeping him in a basement and I tell him what to say and I'm mad that he's successful.
[01:39:19.872 --> 01:39:25.493]  The opposite BuzzFeed or Daily Beach or wherever the hell this fake Daily Beach is, it's the opposite.
[01:39:25.513 --> 01:39:26.173]  I told Paul
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:39.424]  I gave you a raise six years ago to start coming on the show and to start speaking out because you're a smart guy and I need you on air.
[01:39:39.785 --> 01:39:40.325]  And that's why.
[01:39:40.765 --> 01:39:41.946]  I made him go on air.
[01:39:42.106 --> 01:39:43.426]  I want him to get bigger than me.
[01:39:43.826 --> 01:39:46.227]  It's not an Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader analogy.
[01:39:49.169 --> 01:39:50.269]  It's the opposite of that.
[01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:54.591]  And people need to understand that.
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:58.613]  But that's how the left operates in their whole weird, jealous, whacked-out world.
[01:40:01.575 --> 01:40:07.517]  That I keep Paul in a basement and that I chew him out constantly.
[01:40:09.758 --> 01:40:10.478]  It's the opposite.
[01:40:12.699 --> 01:40:17.720]  Paul can kill any story on InfoWars or Prison Planet anytime he wants.
[01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:22.482]  Kit Daniels, I trust Kit, he can do that now.
[01:40:23.082 --> 01:40:27.203]  Three people can kill any story anytime in case I'm not paying attention or something we think's wrong.
[01:40:28.598 --> 01:40:35.984]  Kit brought a story to my attention last week that absolutely was bad news and was rumor.
[01:40:36.125 --> 01:40:38.907]  And I unfortunately had to terminate somebody, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:40:38.927 --> 01:40:43.911]  But the point is, is that it's the opposite.
[01:40:44.232 --> 01:40:46.313]  I trust Paul more than myself sometimes.
[01:40:46.333 --> 01:40:48.135]  Because I do get wound up, man.
[01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.816]  It's not an act sometimes when I'm wild-eyed.
[01:40:54.918 --> 01:40:55.679]  It's the opposite.
[01:40:55.839 --> 01:41:01.083]  Paul is there helping me, and I help him some too, on things.
[01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:05.067]  I've taught him a lot, and he'll tell you that, but I don't mean to get off on a digression here.
[01:41:05.387 --> 01:41:06.948]  We're going to open the phones up, talk to Zach.
[01:41:07.008 --> 01:41:10.151]  It's just, I'm looking for men better than me.
[01:41:10.991 --> 01:41:12.492]  I'm looking for women better than me.
[01:41:12.593 --> 01:41:15.255]  I'm looking for people to put in the field.
[01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:21.600]  And if somebody comes along way better than I am at all the skills I've got, like finding Paul Watson, like finding Owen Schroer,
[01:41:23.379 --> 01:41:26.260]  You know, no credit in the little stupid articles to that.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.942]  No, Jones is this knuckle-dragging buffoon who can't even tie his own shoelaces.
[01:41:32.302 --> 01:41:35.544]  That's why all these governments listen, intelligence agencies listen, all the rest of it.
[01:41:36.044 --> 01:41:41.806]  My skill on air, my oratory repertoire is not one-tenth of my main intellect.
[01:41:42.186 --> 01:41:44.487]  And I'm not bragging, just a fact, but I don't...
[01:41:47.415 --> 01:41:53.419]  Enjoy watching the sycophantic manipulations they put out that I know has an effect on some weak minds.
[01:41:56.361 --> 01:41:58.122]  Zach's coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:41:58.742 --> 01:41:59.903]  I need financial support.
[01:41:59.923 --> 01:42:12.991]  You know, the biggest thing you can do against the enemy is get products you absolutely need that make your life better like air filtration, water filtration, highest quality supplements, great paid treat apparel, books, videos, you name it.
[01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:17.309]  For the Culture Wars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:17.329 --> 01:42:18.771]  Super Mill Vitality 50% off.
[01:42:18.791 --> 01:42:20.512]  You get the real red pill that goes great with it.

[01:42:30.662 --> 01:42:33.204]  Again, there aren't reviews on new combos because they're only run for a week.
[01:42:34.522 --> 01:42:36.443]  So there's a bunch of new specials that have got in.
[01:42:36.623 --> 01:42:39.705]  X2, we could extend the sale a little bit because we got an emergency shipment in.
[01:42:40.845 --> 01:42:43.167]  But supplies on that deep earth, pure crystal form of it.
[01:42:43.567 --> 01:42:44.808]  All the other stuff makes me sick.
[01:42:45.068 --> 01:42:45.688]  Everybody else too.
[01:42:45.728 --> 01:42:49.390]  I always knew that iodine was critical, but the stuff they had wasn't real atomic iodine.
[01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:50.911]  It was mixed with alcohol.
[01:42:50.971 --> 01:42:51.711]  It binds to it.
[01:42:51.731 --> 01:42:53.212]  It eats holes in your stomach.
[01:42:53.712 --> 01:42:54.413]  Not this, folks.
[01:42:54.453 --> 01:42:55.593]  This is the real iodine.
[01:42:56.154 --> 01:42:57.054]  This is the real deal.
[01:42:57.134 --> 01:42:57.654]  It's amazing.
[01:42:57.734 --> 01:42:59.355]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:59.475 --> 01:43:00.436]  X2 limited supply.
[01:43:07.375 --> 01:43:16.144]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[01:43:16.564 --> 01:43:23.932]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:24.252 --> 01:43:26.375]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:34.090]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:36.672]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[01:43:36.853 --> 01:43:44.158]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:43:44.339 --> 01:43:54.667]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:43:54.987 --> 01:44:02.551]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:44:02.831 --> 01:44:12.796]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:44:13.037 --> 01:44:14.978]  And this part is most important.
[01:44:15.098 --> 01:44:21.521]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:22.962]  That means it's clean.
[01:44:23.322 --> 01:44:24.223]  That means it's pure.
[01:44:24.443 --> 01:44:27.266]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[01:44:27.346 --> 01:44:29.988]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:44:30.148 --> 01:44:31.790]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:44:33.243 --> 01:44:33.984]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:34.044 --> 01:44:43.610]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:49.374]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:49.714 --> 01:44:52.496]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:52.716 --> 01:45:01.462]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:45:03.583 --> 01:45:11.668]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:45:11.788 --> 01:45:22.673]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:24.474]  It is amazing!
[01:45:25.875 --> 01:45:30.838]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:34.593]  Pike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:34.633 --> 01:45:34.994]  Go ahead.
[01:45:35.895 --> 01:45:37.777]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:37.817 --> 01:45:47.248]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:48.330 --> 01:45:51.674]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:45:52.154 --> 01:45:52.414]  Absolutely.
[01:46:14.922 --> 01:46:27.809]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:34.508]  You think our information is hardcore?
[01:46:34.868 --> 01:46:36.129]  You think our focus is brutal?

[01:47:06.279 --> 01:47:08.913]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.203]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:35.423 --> 01:47:38.628]  We're gonna open the phones up in the second hour, but let me go right to Zach.
[01:47:40.009 --> 01:47:42.250]  Again, who soon will reveal his identity.
[01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:44.211]  I think you should do it sooner rather than later.
[01:47:44.492 --> 01:47:45.632]  He's worked for multiple U.S.
[01:47:45.652 --> 01:47:48.394]  government agencies, Army, Special Operations, Intelligence.
[01:47:48.714 --> 01:47:55.518]  He's been in the newspaper, he's been on TV before with other operations and things he's done for the country.
[01:47:56.378 --> 01:48:03.462]  But he's been exposing, not classified things, but just the understanding of the deep state and their moves against Trump and their moves against America.
[01:48:03.502 --> 01:48:08.365]  He's been picked up by the FBI, taken to CENTCOM before in Florida.
[01:48:09.025 --> 01:48:20.172]  But now he was flying out of the International Airport in San Francisco a few hours ago, right before the broadcast started about three hours ago, in route to Dubai, and they grabbed him.
[01:48:20.252 --> 01:48:27.797]  And I know he can't get too much into his regular day job and the security detail he had and what they were taking to Dubai, but this is clear targeting.
[01:48:27.857 --> 01:48:32.260]  So he was going to be joining us today, ladies and gentlemen, but now he can't do that.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.000]  He's got to go.
[01:48:33.681 --> 01:48:36.603]  But go ahead, Zach, break down what's happened.
[01:48:37.901 --> 01:48:38.582]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:38.602 --> 01:48:41.147]  Obviously, the call yesterday, and first and foremost, it's great to be on with you.
[01:48:41.167 --> 01:48:43.992]  Just a real, real crazy morning.
[01:48:44.052 --> 01:48:50.223]  Yeah, like you said, we were, you know, attempting to travel, as we're trying to do again here, to Dubai out of San Francisco International there.
[01:48:51.121 --> 01:49:00.886]  We got our tickets, made it through, we're just about to make it through the security checkpoint where they take your IDs and tickets there, and we were pulled aside and escorted by a couple members from Homeland Security there.
[01:49:01.106 --> 01:49:13.353]  Then we get moved to the detention area there in the airport, and of course two FBI agents are there questioning the contents of an individual who I'm traveling with in a bag, which happen to be external hard drives that, you know, are completely illegal.
[01:49:13.433 --> 01:49:15.114]  They're all our information, that's our stuff.
[01:49:15.194 --> 01:49:17.035]  If they want them, they have to have a warrant to have that.
[01:49:17.855 --> 01:49:25.178]  They were claiming something else that I can't really get into right now, but obviously it was a major intimidation tactic, but let's just say we held on to the hard drives.
[01:49:26.058 --> 01:49:29.780]  We stood up for what was right there, but they're making this very difficult for us.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:38.843]  My attorney currently does have the hard drives that we were attempting to travel with, but all in all, a pretty big intimidation process.
[01:49:39.983 --> 01:49:45.746]  And not the first time I've had issues with TSA, specifically in JFK and Charles De Gaulle in France.
[01:49:45.786 --> 01:49:46.606]  I've had some issues there.
[01:49:47.415 --> 01:49:52.897]  At the behest of our government, which is completely ridiculous because the idea is they don't know who I am or what's going on is a real problem.
[01:49:52.957 --> 01:49:55.018]  But at the end of the day, you know, we're going to continue to prevail.
[01:49:55.218 --> 01:49:58.620]  But obviously, we're right over the target yesterday, really got their attention.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.242]  You know, just another day in the life of this pretty crazy stuff this morning.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:19.594]  Well, they're explaining to people that the government's not one monolithic system, and just like Tosh Plumlee was able to give the exclusives on Benghazi one week after it happened because he was still flying missions, he'd been a whistleblower in Iran-Contra, a whistleblower in the church committees.
[01:50:19.874 --> 01:50:22.837]  People say, well, how's he still in the CIA if he exposed it?
[01:50:22.877 --> 01:50:24.479]  He was exposing criminal activities.
[01:50:25.099 --> 01:50:27.222]  Now he's had to leave to South America.
[01:50:28.172 --> 01:50:29.073]  Uh, for his safety.
[01:50:29.714 --> 01:50:34.299]  So, uh, this is just incredible, uh, what's ended up happening.
[01:50:34.339 --> 01:50:43.709]  He, he, I can't get into where he is specifically, obviously, but he's now done and made his final sacrifice basically before he had to just hide in the jungle to tell that.
[01:50:43.749 --> 01:50:45.692]  So explain it to the people how this works.
[01:50:47.222 --> 01:50:47.662]  It's crazy.
[01:50:47.702 --> 01:50:50.403]  I mean, it's stratified compartmentalization.
[01:50:50.503 --> 01:50:52.924]  There's levels within sections.
[01:50:53.324 --> 01:50:57.045]  And of course, at some levels, there's perpetual chain commands that are all flawed.
[01:50:57.105 --> 01:50:58.005]  But there are patriots.
[01:50:58.025 --> 01:50:59.486]  There are people who want to do the right thing here.
[01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:02.447]  And certain agencies are dug in more than others, obviously.
[01:51:02.487 --> 01:51:04.187]  But there's a lot coming out this week.
[01:51:04.287 --> 01:51:09.589]  And some of the stuff we hinted at yesterday, the stuff that Devin Nunes is getting into with the Five Eyes,
[01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.389]  I think?
[01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.790]  We're good to go.
[01:52:05.411 --> 01:52:07.055]  We must continue to fight.
[01:52:07.135 --> 01:52:08.058]  That's just all there is to it.
[01:52:08.078 --> 01:52:09.081]  There's no going back now.
[01:52:09.101 --> 01:52:10.044]  There's no tiptoeing.
[01:52:10.425 --> 01:52:11.468]  Everything's about to happen.
[01:52:11.688 --> 01:52:12.390]  We're in it right now.
[01:52:14.645 --> 01:52:22.007]  And you see, and I'm not whining, I just want listeners to get this, this is not a Netflix action-adventure movie where they're coming after me, they're coming after you, they're coming after Trump.
[01:52:22.328 --> 01:52:23.348]  This is the real world.
[01:52:23.648 --> 01:52:25.289]  We're in a battle right now.
[01:52:25.769 --> 01:52:33.131]  And I didn't report this a month ago, I didn't tell you this, because you're under such scrutiny and the rest of it, we don't talk on the phone, you talk through the producers.
[01:52:33.571 --> 01:52:38.153]  I checked you out with some folks, they say you're a good guy, then I looked you up, and of course you were public, you didn't even tell me that.
[01:52:39.468 --> 01:52:45.832]  You just called in the show like a year ago, and I knew your info kept lining up with stuff that I already knew or that I learned later from really high-level people.
[01:52:46.532 --> 01:52:48.974]  I got a call, and then I got a visit.
[01:52:48.994 --> 01:52:51.755]  There's a lot of folks here in the Austin community.
[01:52:51.775 --> 01:52:52.516]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:52:52.536 --> 01:52:55.738]  You know, leaders, former leaders of major groups.
[01:52:55.778 --> 01:52:58.399]  We all know that means you're never a former leader in one of those groups.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:04.983]  And they were telling me what one of the directors wanted me to know, one of the sub-directors of the CIA.
[01:53:06.348 --> 01:53:10.290]  And I'm being told, these guys don't tell you anything unless it's been authorized.
[01:53:10.731 --> 01:53:11.951]  And I'm like, why are you being told?
[01:53:12.011 --> 01:53:14.213]  I trust these guys, but why are you telling me this?
[01:53:15.013 --> 01:53:17.175]  And they go, you can go with it.
[01:53:18.215 --> 01:53:18.836]  And I didn't.
[01:53:18.856 --> 01:53:20.737]  And about two weeks later, they go, why didn't you go with that?
[01:53:22.117 --> 01:53:22.718]  And I said,
[01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:36.737]  Because it's the director of, you know, I'm not going to say, and then later I get another connection from somebody saying, hey, the director, you've been given this info, why aren't you doing it?
[01:53:37.097 --> 01:53:49.925]  And then I saw ISIS is going to target CNN, the Federal Reserve, the UN, then I saw all the preparation, and then all the pieces went together, and then you're on air saying what I've told no one, and you didn't get that from the same people, did you?
[01:53:52.066 --> 01:54:01.112]  I'm sure some of our circles interconnect when it comes to information, but that's coming from a very, very high level source and certain think tanks that do not get that information confused that's as accurate as it is.
[01:54:01.132 --> 01:54:02.673]  Well then let me ask you, what do you make of this?
[01:54:02.713 --> 01:54:05.495]  I've never had people push stuff on me.
[01:54:05.695 --> 01:54:07.636]  That's why I didn't do it, because it was being pushed on me.
[01:54:07.936 --> 01:54:09.617]  But now you can see it makes sense.
[01:54:09.978 --> 01:54:11.899]  The media is doing pre-programming ahead of it.
[01:54:12.119 --> 01:54:13.280]  False flags against themselves.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:26.207]  Truly, there's more going on in each hour of these next coming days than has happened in months and years in recent history, because each move is being countered, and it's a very elaborate game being played right now.
[01:54:26.787 --> 01:54:37.934]  But like we spoke about, there is very, very serious, critical, critical, and very credible intel out there about false flags being planned to be pulled off in this country on said targets.
[01:54:38.454 --> 01:54:38.895]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.555 --> 01:55:14.887]  Well, you've been saying the whole Iran thing last week on the show, and now that's coming out.
[01:55:14.967 --> 01:55:15.768]  I mean, what's the word?
[01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:20.653]  Because obviously there's the pallets of money, all the illegal activity with Iran, backdoor deals.
[01:55:20.673 --> 01:55:21.955]  Are you saying a lot of that's about to come out?
[01:55:23.092 --> 01:55:26.094]  All of it's about to come out predicated on the Syrian attack.
[01:55:26.694 --> 01:55:28.595]  That Syrian attack pushed everything to the forefront.
[01:55:29.156 --> 01:55:30.056]  Things will be revealed.
[01:55:30.317 --> 01:55:31.197]  It's going to happen this week.
[01:55:31.237 --> 01:55:32.738]  Things are going to be revealed and it's going to change.
[01:55:33.178 --> 01:55:38.682]  So is Trump fighting back or does it show he's still sliding or was there some more sophisticated thing now that you know more?
[01:55:41.263 --> 01:55:44.104]  Honestly, I think he's kind of caught between a rock and a hard place there.
[01:55:44.124 --> 01:55:49.127]  This deal that was made with the Saudis was very problematic, but maybe he thinks he could cross it at some level.
[01:55:49.567 --> 01:55:56.910]  But some of the information out there is pretty damning, and we just really have to back Trump and really get through to him and say, stick to the plan, and do not appease these war hawks.
[01:55:56.950 --> 01:56:01.652]  Do not impede the military-industrial complex, because they will come for your neck, and there's just no question about it.
[01:56:01.672 --> 01:56:02.332]  They're coming for you.
[01:56:02.872 --> 01:56:06.714]  And you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, if you're interested in his situation.
[01:56:06.734 --> 01:56:09.475]  But he knew this when he was getting ready to run, when he was approached by military,
[01:56:09.895 --> 01:56:10.876]  It's all bad plans.
[01:56:10.936 --> 01:56:12.677]  What do you think we should do?
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.303]  Honestly, what we should do is actually start the tribunals.
[01:56:34.903 --> 01:56:35.564]  Get right to it.
[01:56:35.804 --> 01:56:36.444]  Really uncover.
[01:56:36.464 --> 01:56:37.866]  Start with the prechecks.
[01:56:37.886 --> 01:56:42.209]  That's right, because there are deep networks in the government that aren't going to ever let us have peace.
[01:56:44.039 --> 01:56:44.480]  Absolutely.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:46.121]  Start with Fast and Furious as the pretext.
[01:56:46.181 --> 01:56:48.583]  Really get into what's been going on during that past administration.
[01:56:48.603 --> 01:56:49.424]  Start prosecuting.
[01:56:49.704 --> 01:56:56.931]  And at that point, during discovery, a lot of things will start to happen and start to open based on the narrative switching and things happening.
[01:56:57.031 --> 01:57:00.434]  Listen, and we said it yesterday, Huma Abedin committed treason in this country.
[01:57:00.574 --> 01:57:02.376]  Hillary Rodham Clinton committed treason in this country.
[01:57:02.676 --> 01:57:07.000]  Barack Hussein, Hussein, Hussein Obama has committed treason in this country.
[01:57:07.401 --> 01:57:09.623]  It is our duty, it is our obligation to call them out.
[01:57:10.343 --> 01:57:12.585]  Oh, they're scared and they're intending to sew it up.
[01:57:12.645 --> 01:57:13.425]  Zach, you're absolutely right.
[01:57:13.445 --> 01:57:13.946]  I know you've got to go.
[01:57:13.966 --> 01:57:16.287]  As soon as you get to Dubai, let's get you on the broadcast.
[01:57:16.307 --> 01:57:16.968]  Your info's been spot on.
[01:57:17.368 --> 01:57:18.008]  Thank you so much, Zach.
[01:57:18.028 --> 01:57:18.489]  Absolutely.
[01:57:18.549 --> 01:57:18.869]  Will do.
[01:57:18.909 --> 01:57:19.309]  Have a good one.
[01:57:39.989 --> 01:57:41.250]  All right, there goes Zach.
[01:57:41.290 --> 01:57:41.851]  Pray for him.
[01:57:42.591 --> 01:57:47.455]  We're going to come back and open the phones up on any subject you want to cover, and I got a ton of news I haven't had, and a bunch of video clips.
[01:57:47.496 --> 01:57:48.296]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:48.556 --> 01:57:49.437]  Have you spread the links?
[01:57:49.477 --> 01:57:50.618]  Have you told folks about the show?
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:58:01.688]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.918 --> 01:58:04.720]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:11.888]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:12.288 --> 01:58:18.074]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:18.775 --> 01:58:20.076]  Our ancestors knew work.
[01:58:20.697 --> 01:58:39.754]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.835 --> 01:58:44.962]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:45.282 --> 01:58:47.826]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[01:58:47.906 --> 01:58:50.550]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:52.012]  As above, so below.
[01:58:52.573 --> 01:58:55.417]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:56.278 --> 01:58:57.359]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:57.879 --> 01:58:58.980]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:00.881]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:01.282 --> 01:59:01.762]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.882 --> 01:59:02.382]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.883 --> 01:59:03.463]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:04.164 --> 01:59:06.285]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.785 --> 01:59:12.749]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:13.130 --> 01:59:19.014]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:19.754 --> 01:59:26.037]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.798 --> 01:59:30.240]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:41.806]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:42.466 --> 01:59:44.847]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:45.487 --> 01:59:48.728]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at m4slife.com.
[01:59:49.068 --> 01:59:52.809]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:58.351]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.172]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.565 --> 02:00:19.549]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:20.129 --> 02:00:22.891]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:29.716 --> 02:00:31.497]  Alright folks, I'm gonna give the number out.
[02:00:33.178 --> 02:00:38.362]  For first-time callers, about the state of the world, about how they're trying to bring Trump down.
[02:00:38.382 --> 02:00:39.583]  You know, I blew up at Trump.
[02:00:40.959 --> 02:00:52.121]  About eight, nine days ago, not last Friday, but the Friday before last, because I've been real emotional about war with Russia and the whole thing in Syria and knowing that if Trump did that, we'd be on the wrong side of history.
[02:00:52.921 --> 02:00:57.162]  And then I thought that he backed off when the Secretary of Defense said, no, there's no evidence that they did the chemical attack.
[02:00:58.722 --> 02:01:05.423]  And so I went home pretty happy at like seven o'clock, 630, got home, had dinner with the kids, swam in the pool.
[02:01:06.203 --> 02:01:09.264]  We were going to sit down and, you know, watch an old movie or something.
[02:01:11.798 --> 02:01:12.819]  They'd never seen Old Yeller.
[02:01:12.839 --> 02:01:15.360]  We were actually queuing Old Yeller up at like 8.30 at night.
[02:01:15.741 --> 02:01:18.242]  And I don't usually let them stay up past 10, but I was gonna let them do that.
[02:01:19.263 --> 02:01:20.764]  And, uh, I mean, my son's older.
[02:01:20.784 --> 02:01:22.305]  He didn't want to watch Old Yeller, but my daughter's.
[02:01:23.606 --> 02:01:37.215]  And my daughters are sitting there in my lap and everything, and I go in the bathroom and pull up my phone while my wife's making brownies and getting ice cream ready.
[02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:47.449]  And while I'm sitting there taking a piss, looking at the phone, I see Trump striking Syria.
[02:01:48.810 --> 02:01:51.493]  And I had just eaten a bunch of food and I was tired.
[02:01:52.695 --> 02:01:56.920]  And I'm like, oh my, and so there's the emotion of, you know, and then Rex wanted to go to my dad's house.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:58.482]  He goes, I just want to stay with my grandparents tonight.
[02:01:58.782 --> 02:01:59.363]  Can I go with you?
[02:01:59.423 --> 02:02:00.824]  And I said, because they live by the studio.
[02:02:02.216 --> 02:02:02.896]  Like a half mile.
[02:02:03.097 --> 02:02:10.521]  So I, you know, I drive over there and I just get in here and then the crew does a great job.
[02:02:10.561 --> 02:02:11.682]  And I don't just say a great job.
[02:02:11.722 --> 02:02:12.843]  They do an amazing job.
[02:02:12.903 --> 02:02:24.731]  And Rob do runs up here and everything from his family and he teaches basketball and other sports and he runs up here and he's got three cameras because I wanted to go live on those cameras before I went live.
[02:02:24.791 --> 02:02:26.912]  And then in here, I'm just telling you what happened.
[02:02:27.492 --> 02:02:28.493]  And I say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:28.793 --> 02:02:29.714]  Yeah, we're going to go live in here.
[02:02:31.024 --> 02:02:32.884]  And then we're going to go live in there.
[02:02:32.904 --> 02:02:33.625]  And I was mumbling.
[02:02:34.005 --> 02:02:35.205]  He says, you know, you're tired, whatever.
[02:02:35.665 --> 02:02:37.145]  All of a sudden, he's like, thumbs up.
[02:02:37.185 --> 02:02:41.686]  And I realize I'm on air while I'm venting, which I don't do a lot.
[02:02:42.907 --> 02:02:44.007]  Maybe like every couple of weeks.
[02:02:44.647 --> 02:02:47.268]  Did a little of it today because I forgot to eat breakfast this morning and worked out hard.
[02:02:47.888 --> 02:02:49.028]  About noon, I had like a headache.
[02:02:49.048 --> 02:02:49.468]  I was getting grumpy.
[02:02:49.488 --> 02:02:50.628]  I went, oh, I forgot to eat.
[02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:51.569]  Better eat something.
[02:02:52.169 --> 02:02:56.870]  But I'm just explaining the psychology for listeners to understand that this isn't an act here on air.
[02:02:57.904 --> 02:03:21.656]  Okay, this is what we're really doing, we really believe in this, and I'm in control most of the time, but the emotion got to me, and I was already going, man, I'm sick of Trump, this is BS, he better not be going sideways, F this, F that, and I'm saying F... I meant to say Dumford, because I've heard he's somewhat pro-war, and I can't say that because it's all very opaque, but I'm saying F... Mattis.
[02:03:21.756 --> 02:03:25.898]  Mattis is the one trying to stop it, that's confirmed, that's what I mean, it was just kind of an incoherent train ride.
[02:03:27.952 --> 02:03:30.414]  And then dudes like doing thumbs up, looking at me.
[02:03:32.176 --> 02:03:34.237]  And I'm like, that's live on air?
[02:03:36.039 --> 02:03:37.700]  They did it again Saturday night.
[02:03:38.301 --> 02:03:40.963]  We were up here putting new lights in that don't burn my eyeballs out.
[02:03:41.364 --> 02:03:42.805]  That's a dude working seven days a week.
[02:03:44.066 --> 02:03:44.947]  I don't make him do it.
[02:03:44.987 --> 02:03:45.647]  He's so dedicated.
[02:03:45.687 --> 02:03:47.088]  He's like, hey, we got to put new lights in.
[02:03:47.108 --> 02:03:47.869]  Those are really bad.
[02:03:47.889 --> 02:03:52.493]  We got some better ones now that are LED, which are so good.
[02:03:52.513 --> 02:03:53.534]  These lights are better than the others.
[02:03:55.529 --> 02:03:57.670]  We were up here until six or seven, putting the lights in.
[02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:05.851]  And I get home and Sunday morning, there's like a 30 second video where they just had a live feed cameras in here.
[02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:08.112]  Somebody took them down and then they did a live feed.
[02:04:08.152 --> 02:04:09.052]  And I'm not mad about it.
[02:04:09.112 --> 02:04:09.952]  It didn't show anything.
[02:04:09.972 --> 02:04:10.713]  There was nothing to show.
[02:04:10.733 --> 02:04:12.173]  I'm talking about fixing lights.
[02:04:14.073 --> 02:04:15.534]  But then that creates the whole other story.
[02:04:15.594 --> 02:04:16.874]  Is Jones faking this?
[02:04:17.654 --> 02:04:19.995]  You know, he really rant and say, wait a minute, that's live.
[02:04:21.055 --> 02:04:24.896]  That's what made me get even more pissed because I wasn't ready to go live.
[02:04:26.484 --> 02:04:27.731]  But it's my fault not being clear.
[02:04:27.751 --> 02:04:29.963]  I'm like, yeah, yeah, go live there before here and then go live there.
[02:04:30.003 --> 02:04:30.345]  Go live!
[02:04:32.182 --> 02:04:35.944]  And then he sees me start ranting, and he thinks, well, he's the one lying.
[02:04:36.364 --> 02:04:37.264]  He thought he messed up.
[02:04:37.684 --> 02:04:39.485]  And then I'm like, I just screwed up.
[02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:45.548]  So then I'm even more mad, and then that fuels the explosion about Trump, which I'm not walking back.
[02:04:45.628 --> 02:04:49.430]  I was mad, but I didn't... It's not like I hate Trump now, and he's evil, and he's bad.
[02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:52.251]  It's just that it hurt my feelings and upset me, and I was honest.
[02:04:52.911 --> 02:04:55.092]  And they act like the fact that I'm honest is some weakness.
[02:04:55.252 --> 02:04:56.453]  I think it's a strength.
[02:04:56.473 --> 02:04:58.834]  We'll be back to give the number out, cover all the big news.
[02:04:58.854 --> 02:04:59.294]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.641 --> 02:05:04.241]  Alpha Power.
[02:05:04.601 --> 02:05:05.421]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:05:05.641 --> 02:05:11.603]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:05:12.263 --> 02:05:15.803]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:05:16.684 --> 02:05:24.645]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:05:25.185 --> 02:05:28.546]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:05:29.526 --> 02:05:32.707]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:05:32.787 --> 02:05:34.487]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:05:34.847 --> 02:05:39.949]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:47.851]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[02:05:48.211 --> 02:05:49.212]  We're good to go.
[02:06:04.335 --> 02:06:05.696]  You got it.
[02:06:05.776 --> 02:06:11.159]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:11.239 --> 02:06:13.341]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:15.362]  Alright, here I go.
[02:06:15.622 --> 02:06:21.346]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:23.247 --> 02:06:25.188]  Are we seeing the earth?
[02:06:25.228 --> 02:06:27.629]  You got it.
[02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:31.052]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[02:06:33.084 --> 02:06:36.348]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:36.368 --> 02:06:37.329]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.810]  We're going to put the phones up at this hour.
[02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.971]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:39.471]  877-789-2539 is the number.
[02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:39.852]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[02:06:49.977 --> 02:06:58.266]  I'll be honest with you, I really disdain Hollywood, I disdain pop culture, and the worship of it makes me sick.
[02:06:58.306 --> 02:07:06.454]  So I would see Kanye West and the Kardashians and all of that just bombarding me for a decade and I didn't like Kanye West.
[02:07:07.656 --> 02:07:11.580]  But then I, years after it was out, watched the Simpsons
[02:07:13.190 --> 02:07:15.051]  Not the Simpsons, what's the name of that show?
[02:07:15.572 --> 02:07:16.672]  Teleprompter for you folks.
[02:07:16.692 --> 02:07:17.993]  What's the name of that show?
[02:07:18.653 --> 02:07:21.375]  South Park, which I occasionally watch online.
[02:07:21.775 --> 02:07:22.956]  South Park, Gay Fish.
[02:07:23.556 --> 02:07:25.318]  And I thought, that is great music.
[02:07:25.458 --> 02:07:29.960]  And my family's like, my kids are like, no dad, that's what he sounds like.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.982]  I was like, well that's actually really good music.
[02:07:32.002 --> 02:07:34.883]  So I heard listening to some Kanye West music.
[02:07:36.184 --> 02:07:39.026]  Then I saw him like Trump.
[02:07:40.307 --> 02:07:42.148]  And I thought that was bold, but I thought it might be a stunt.
[02:07:42.188 --> 02:07:45.329]  And then now coming out for Candace Owens, and she's being attacked.
[02:07:46.389 --> 02:07:49.691]  Tom Arnold saying, why don't you suck some racist you-know-what?
[02:07:49.791 --> 02:07:50.611]  Totally sexist.
[02:07:50.831 --> 02:07:52.031]  Imagine if a conservative did that.
[02:07:52.251 --> 02:07:52.912]  That clown.
[02:07:54.712 --> 02:07:58.494]  Hey, Tom Arnold, how about you suck on my fist, punk?
[02:07:59.434 --> 02:08:03.836]  If I go from memory, Tom Arnold, I don't mean that literally, it's figuratively, because I'm scared of Tom Arnold, he's so tough.
[02:08:04.336 --> 02:08:06.277]  Tom Arnold shot his mouth off against me quite a bit.
[02:08:06.717 --> 02:08:09.518]  But you're just such a thug, why don't you quit picking on girls, man?
[02:08:11.829 --> 02:08:12.649]  Strong black woman.
[02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:16.371]  Because Candace Owens is good looking and she's smart.
[02:08:16.411 --> 02:08:18.492]  She came here, came on the show a few days, went to dinner.
[02:08:18.812 --> 02:08:19.412]  Her and my wife.
[02:08:19.593 --> 02:08:20.333]  Really smart lady.
[02:08:21.633 --> 02:08:23.414]  We have the video where we did the Russia joke.
[02:08:23.434 --> 02:08:24.375]  We went to Russia House.
[02:08:24.395 --> 02:08:26.035]  It's like a Russia themed restaurant.
[02:08:26.456 --> 02:08:26.956]  As a joke.
[02:08:27.836 --> 02:08:28.817]  Can we cue that video up?
[02:08:29.317 --> 02:08:30.357]  With my wife, Millie Weaver.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.362]  Yeah, because what I'm getting at here is this is just crazy.
[02:08:34.622 --> 02:08:41.087]  This woman just says, hey, I'm really a libertarian, I'm not really conservative, but the left tries to control women, tries to control black people.
[02:08:41.307 --> 02:08:42.167]  That's totally true.
[02:08:42.208 --> 02:08:42.908]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:08:43.248 --> 02:08:56.478]  And now they're saying she can suck such and such when the woman is a well-spoken, nice, evil, even-mannered person that this whole evil system is attacking.
[02:08:58.407 --> 02:08:58.847]  I mean, look at this.
[02:08:58.867 --> 02:08:59.628]  Talk about evil.
[02:08:59.868 --> 02:09:03.971]  Actor Tom Arnold tells Candace Owens to suck, racist, you know what.
[02:09:07.293 --> 02:09:10.536]  And he's just such a stupid, dumb, talentless clown.
[02:09:17.099 --> 02:09:20.223]  It's just crazy how they do all of this.
[02:09:20.303 --> 02:09:24.287]  It's crazy how they sit there and they attack people and they get away with it.
[02:09:24.668 --> 02:09:31.836]  And how the left can attack free speech at a free speech platform like PEN America, the freedom to write.
[02:09:32.076 --> 02:09:38.003]  And then Hillary calls for a war on free speech there, claiming we're trying to take her speech when she's the one with the big tech giants doing it.
[02:09:40.803 --> 02:09:44.066]  I gotta tell you, I admire Kanye West for his courage.
[02:09:44.086 --> 02:09:51.653]  Remember, they locked him up when he came out and said he still supported Trump last year for almost two weeks in a mental ward saying that was crazy?
[02:09:53.134 --> 02:09:54.375]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:54.615 --> 02:09:56.617]  That's like the old Soviet Union.
[02:09:58.158 --> 02:10:03.042]  Meanwhile, why does the Google documents show and admit
[02:10:04.246 --> 02:10:12.393]  The day one InfoWars.com shut down, the number one reason was we exposed the chemical attacks were staged three times.
[02:10:15.276 --> 02:10:17.118]  Not once, not twice, but three times.
[02:10:20.621 --> 02:10:23.183]  And then they say, and Ron Paul's fake news too, he needs to be banned.
[02:10:24.384 --> 02:10:29.789]  And now you see us being delisted, being pushed down, all the fake news about us being put at the top.
[02:10:31.772 --> 02:10:40.760]  And again, CNN and others have aired this footage we're showing for TV viewers of the guy that looks like a fake doctor, blinking, you know, winking, and then falling down.
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.301]  Oh, it's the worst acting.
[02:10:42.361 --> 02:10:46.084]  I mean, high school plays, junior high plays, elementary school plays are better.
[02:10:46.485 --> 02:10:47.806]  I've seen my daughters in better plays.
[02:10:48.266 --> 02:10:48.626]  Way better.
[02:10:49.447 --> 02:10:51.109]  And then the kids, they're laughing behind him.
[02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:53.711]  And they kind of forget to have their legs flopping.
[02:10:53.731 --> 02:10:55.692]  It doesn't mean chemical weapons attacks don't happen.
[02:10:56.093 --> 02:10:58.014]  It means they've caught the rebels, and now.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:10:59.641]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:11:00.122 --> 02:11:03.986]  ISIS used chemical weapons at least 52 times in Syria and Iraq, report says.
[02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:11.315]  Chemical inspection team reaches DOMA negates Russia cover-up claim.
[02:11:11.636 --> 02:11:12.016]  That's the...
[02:11:13.231 --> 02:11:16.613]  Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons that the U.S.
[02:11:16.653 --> 02:11:16.993]  backs.
[02:11:17.553 --> 02:11:20.014]  They said, no, we couldn't get out because the rebels hadn't left yet.
[02:11:20.054 --> 02:11:20.954]  We're still shooting at us.
[02:11:20.974 --> 02:11:22.635]  You know, it's the rebels, ISIS.
[02:11:22.875 --> 02:11:24.476]  And once we got there, they were still shooting at us.
[02:11:24.716 --> 02:11:26.077]  The Russians did not stop us.
[02:11:26.117 --> 02:11:28.778]  But Fox News, especially, man, and CNN.
[02:11:28.918 --> 02:11:30.419]  Oh, my gosh, the Russians.
[02:11:30.779 --> 02:11:33.940]  And I'm not backing the Russians, but they didn't do that.
[02:11:34.961 --> 02:11:38.502]  That zero hedge breaks it down with all the links to the organization's own documents.
[02:11:39.022 --> 02:11:39.823]  Germany's largest
[02:11:40.751 --> 02:11:48.539]  Public TV, news broadcaster, goes to Syria, goes to the hospitals, investigates, says chemical attack most likely staged.
[02:11:50.541 --> 02:11:52.563]  They don't know what to do.
[02:11:54.926 --> 02:11:57.528]  Does that mean every chemical attack is not real?
[02:11:57.608 --> 02:11:57.849]  No.
[02:11:58.249 --> 02:12:03.014]  Like the 52 that killed thousands that the rebels launched, that ISIS launched, that Saudi Arabia funded?
[02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:06.612]  Those were real!
[02:12:07.472 --> 02:12:11.575]  So the media will go, Jones claims there's no chemical attacks, but look at these.
[02:12:12.095 --> 02:12:12.335]  No, no.
[02:12:14.056 --> 02:12:16.618]  The rebels are doing real ones, but again, they play this bait-and-switch.
[02:12:16.978 --> 02:12:19.440]  Jones doesn't care about kids getting killed by chemicals.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.222]  Did you hear Jones said nobody died in Syria?
[02:12:22.522 --> 02:12:24.043]  He doesn't care about Syrian kids.
[02:12:24.103 --> 02:12:25.444]  Now, I didn't start the war like Hillary.
[02:12:25.724 --> 02:12:27.045]  I didn't send in all the military.
[02:12:27.285 --> 02:12:28.265]  I didn't destabilize it.
[02:12:28.466 --> 02:12:29.046]  No, you're right.
[02:12:31.648 --> 02:12:32.968]  That's how they play these games.
[02:12:34.169 --> 02:12:35.010]  That's all coming up.
[02:12:39.392 --> 02:12:40.853]  It's powerful information.
[02:12:40.873 --> 02:12:45.097]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with your calls.
[02:12:45.177 --> 02:12:58.909]  I'm going to stop right here and I'm going to ask the listeners, if you believe in free speech, if you believe in the truth, if you believe in standing up to Soros and Hillary and these bullies and the DNC that's suing me and Trump and everybody else, it's total war.
[02:12:59.209 --> 02:13:00.290]  They want to break your will.
[02:13:00.330 --> 02:13:01.251]  You're flyover country.
[02:13:01.471 --> 02:13:02.132]  You're a bitter claim.
[02:13:02.152 --> 02:13:04.154]  No matter where you live, if you're a good person,
[02:13:05.427 --> 02:13:08.028]  These are authoritarians that think we're weak, that they're going to win.
[02:13:08.128 --> 02:13:20.031]  If you'll just spread the videos, the articles, sign up for the free podcast, send out the videos, post them to your own site, send them out in the email, hand out business cards with info wars, it will change the world.
[02:13:20.631 --> 02:13:21.391]  And pray for us.
[02:13:21.671 --> 02:13:22.351]  We're praying for you.
[02:13:22.371 --> 02:13:22.932]  We're in this together.
[02:13:23.092 --> 02:13:24.192]  And I thank you for all your help.
[02:13:25.492 --> 02:13:26.773]  They're so mad we have a connection.
[02:13:26.793 --> 02:13:28.213]  They're so mad that we're able to speak to you.
[02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:31.014]  They're so mad we're here trying to get it right, trying to tell the truth.
[02:13:31.094 --> 02:13:32.274]  It's a world different from the globalist.
[02:13:33.874 --> 02:13:37.495]  And financially, we've got supplements that are the best out there.
[02:13:37.855 --> 02:13:38.576]  Take X2.
[02:13:39.916 --> 02:13:42.797]  They tried to take away our really clean deep sea seaweed.
[02:13:44.558 --> 02:13:47.899]  Deep sea, far out to ocean, clean seaweed derivative of this.
[02:13:48.519 --> 02:13:49.439]  And they took that away.
[02:13:49.659 --> 02:13:51.140]  They hit us with economic sabotage.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.421]  And they said, we're not going to supply you anymore with the cleanest organic group out there that had a lot weaker iodine.
[02:13:55.441 --> 02:13:57.402]  It wasn't atomic, but it was clean.
[02:13:57.422 --> 02:13:58.362]  It didn't make people feel bad.
[02:13:58.382 --> 02:13:59.783]  They said, if you get in the store, I'll kill you.
[02:14:00.043 --> 02:14:00.923]  It's not real iodine.
[02:14:00.963 --> 02:14:01.904]  It's bound with chemicals.
[02:14:01.984 --> 02:14:02.564]  It's in alcohol.
[02:14:04.687 --> 02:14:12.233]  But research iodine deficiency and how sick it makes people and all the problems with it and then realize we have the good iodine.
[02:14:13.134 --> 02:14:26.785]  We have the deep earth crystal source that nobody else has gotten in our search for better iodine that is in the palm oil organic infusion that feels great, gives you the energy, gives you the halogen you need but doesn't
[02:14:27.907 --> 02:14:29.969]  Eat holes in your stomach, at least in my case, and everybody else's.
[02:14:29.989 --> 02:14:31.230]  They say, wow, I can finally take iodine.
[02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:35.934]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:38.416]  I drink it in water, but I forget to take it.
[02:14:38.476 --> 02:14:39.397]  I take it every couple days.
[02:14:41.979 --> 02:14:43.580]  When I forget to take it, I'm like, wow, where's my energy?
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:44.461]  Where's that sparkle?
[02:14:44.481 --> 02:14:45.101]  Where is it in my mind?
[02:14:45.662 --> 02:14:46.242]  A libido.
[02:14:46.262 --> 02:14:51.547]  Because I get busy, and I know this stuff all works, and I use it, but we got 80-something supplements.
[02:14:52.207 --> 02:14:53.849]  I'm taking a lot of them every morning.
[02:14:55.114 --> 02:14:59.736]  But when I do take it, my wife's like, um, what's, what's, what's going on here?
[02:15:01.377 --> 02:15:06.539]  She's like, not, not just my libido, but it's like I'm 16 again.
[02:15:06.599 --> 02:15:09.380]  You know, it's a, it's a bigger day.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:11.041]  And, and, and that's the whole thing.
[02:15:11.241 --> 02:15:13.722]  Iodine without it, ladies and gentlemen, you die.
[02:15:14.676 --> 02:15:19.738]  I can't tell you how many doctors I've talked to that go, no, we're diagnosing scurvy, but the hospitals don't want us to say it.
[02:15:20.398 --> 02:15:27.561]  There are people just with their skin opening up, old wounds opening up, teeth falling out, because they're not eating leafy vegetables, or they have bad malabsorption in their stomachs.
[02:15:28.061 --> 02:15:28.822]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:15:29.022 --> 02:15:29.982]  This is not rocket science.
[02:15:30.022 --> 02:15:35.484]  You need oxygen, you need water, you need iodine, you need vitamin C. You will die without this stuff.
[02:15:36.265 --> 02:15:38.986]  We don't sell a vitamin C product because that's so readily available.
[02:15:40.257 --> 02:15:41.838]  I mean, you can get that, you know, pretty much anywhere.
[02:15:41.858 --> 02:15:46.721]  A glass of orange juice, cabbage, you know, broccoli, whatever.
[02:15:47.362 --> 02:15:50.364]  X2, though, the other iodides we looked into are all bound.
[02:15:50.644 --> 02:15:52.205]  You don't absorb, it goes right through you.
[02:15:52.625 --> 02:15:53.686]  Not X2, baby.
[02:15:54.226 --> 02:15:56.488]  It's pure atomic iodine.
[02:15:56.968 --> 02:15:58.069]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:58.289 --> 02:15:59.110]  It's about to sell out.
[02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:17.234]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[02:16:17.874 --> 02:16:27.197]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[02:16:27.417 --> 02:16:32.239]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[02:16:32.739 --> 02:16:42.048]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[02:16:42.909 --> 02:16:47.613]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[02:16:47.633 --> 02:16:49.175]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[02:16:49.775 --> 02:16:56.081]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[02:16:56.121 --> 02:16:56.882]  Here's my problem.
[02:16:57.402 --> 02:17:05.826]  When I do take the bodies and the exituant things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear, I tend to get mad.
[02:17:06.266 --> 02:17:07.387]  I have the same issue.
[02:17:08.227 --> 02:17:12.389]  Neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[02:17:12.729 --> 02:17:14.810]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:17:14.850 --> 02:17:17.972]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[02:17:18.152 --> 02:17:21.694]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 percuminin level.
[02:17:21.974 --> 02:17:25.936]  We went out to the top labs and said, we want the strongest concentrate
[02:17:26.676 --> 02:17:30.959]  Of it out there, and Mike, you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products.
[02:17:31.279 --> 02:17:36.162]  You were saying that you really like bodies and do think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric.
[02:17:36.882 --> 02:17:37.743]  It's just incredible.
[02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:46.768]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[02:17:46.988 --> 02:17:52.570]  Now, your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:57.272]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICP-MS mass spec testing.
[02:17:57.873 --> 02:18:01.074]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[02:18:01.414 --> 02:18:06.856]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[02:18:06.876 --> 02:18:10.678]  Well, that's another reason the top lab we ended up using to make this said that.
[02:18:10.698 --> 02:18:15.580]  They said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.120]  Exactly.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:23.143]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[02:18:23.483 --> 02:18:27.965]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[02:18:37.461 --> 02:18:46.227]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[02:18:46.647 --> 02:18:54.013]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:54.333 --> 02:18:56.454]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:02.711 --> 02:19:10.395]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:19:11.256 --> 02:19:15.318]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:19:15.838 --> 02:19:18.180]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:22.082]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:19:23.587 --> 02:19:35.732]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:19:36.412 --> 02:19:51.479]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:19:52.479 --> 02:19:56.181]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for your family.
[02:19:56.742 --> 02:19:58.463]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:19:58.483 --> 02:20:00.884]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:20:06.727 --> 02:20:09.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.211 --> 02:20:14.832]  I'm picking up a fake transmission.
[02:20:14.992 --> 02:20:17.073]  I think it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:22.265 --> 02:20:23.806]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[02:20:25.567 --> 02:20:31.832]  You think you're going to assassinate Trump, or shoot down the internet media, and bully a bunch of us that are going along with you?
[02:20:33.873 --> 02:20:35.274]  I'd like to reserve power.
[02:20:35.294 --> 02:20:35.414]  No.
[02:20:35.474 --> 02:20:37.215]  You're wrong from being willing to have a fight.
[02:20:37.495 --> 02:20:38.756]  Wanting one at this point.
[02:20:38.977 --> 02:20:44.320]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros droppings.
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:44.881]  Stabilize.
[02:20:44.921 --> 02:20:51.025]  So to George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the New World Order, and Michael Moore, go back to Haiti, where you came from.
[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:55.833]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma!
[02:20:55.873 --> 02:20:56.894]  You got that, Jack?
[02:20:57.355 --> 02:20:58.035]  You're done!
[02:20:58.316 --> 02:20:58.676]  It's over!
[02:20:58.716 --> 02:20:59.296]  We're alive!
[02:20:59.377 --> 02:21:00.317]  Get him back!
[02:21:01.038 --> 02:21:01.518]  Get him back!
[02:21:01.759 --> 02:21:09.686]  Do you think there was more than one of those guys?
[02:21:10.346 --> 02:21:12.128]  Definitely another cheater.
[02:21:12.188 --> 02:21:12.628]  For sure.
[02:21:12.709 --> 02:21:13.369]  I think cheater.
[02:21:13.449 --> 02:21:17.353]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[02:21:17.513 --> 02:21:17.853]  Clear.
[02:21:17.873 --> 02:21:18.734]  What do you see?
[02:21:20.231 --> 02:21:25.237]  All right, 16 lawsuits have been filed against InfoWars in the last year to shut down our free speech.
[02:21:26.699 --> 02:21:33.407]  Nine of them have been thrown out, many of them with prejudice, meaning they can't bring them back, and meaning that it was fraudulent, and that we could counter sue them.
[02:21:34.869 --> 02:21:38.213]  I just got a call, I got a text earlier, I called my lawyer during the break.
[02:21:40.472 --> 02:21:44.235]  The one in DC, one of the top law firms in the country dealing with defamation and free speech.
[02:21:45.056 --> 02:21:47.898]  He's actually coming here Thursday, by the way, to give you guys a briefing.
[02:21:49.119 --> 02:21:52.902]  To give all the crew a briefing on how we're under the microscope and how they're trying to distort things.
[02:21:53.983 --> 02:21:58.087]  He just got notice they're withdrawing their lawsuit in Georgetown.
[02:22:00.028 --> 02:22:02.710]  They're withdrawing their lawsuit tomorrow morning in Georgetown.
[02:22:04.012 --> 02:22:05.873]  Everything we said in the press conference was true.
[02:22:07.056 --> 02:22:09.077]  It was documented in DC.
[02:22:09.898 --> 02:22:12.459]  And my lawyers were like, we don't think you should give them the strategy.
[02:22:12.499 --> 02:22:13.880]  This is so ridiculous.
[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:17.962]  But if you want to do this, to point out they're attacking your speech, that's fine.
[02:22:18.562 --> 02:22:19.943]  But we'll get this dismissed.
[02:22:21.224 --> 02:22:22.504]  This filing is unbelievable.
[02:22:25.146 --> 02:22:27.027]  Well, they withdrew.
[02:22:27.327 --> 02:22:29.828]  They let them know they're withdrawing the lawsuit tomorrow morning.
[02:22:29.928 --> 02:22:30.629]  Here's the problem.
[02:22:30.729 --> 02:22:31.529]  They're going to refile it.
[02:22:34.651 --> 02:22:35.411]  We just know they are.
[02:22:37.521 --> 02:22:41.542]  So that it'll be, oh, sued again by Georgetown.
[02:22:42.223 --> 02:22:45.304]  Why not sue me every day and then withdraw it again?
[02:22:45.344 --> 02:22:46.164]  You see how this works?
[02:22:46.504 --> 02:22:51.426]  To get the publicity to say the white supremacist Jones said this man killed a woman.
[02:22:51.726 --> 02:22:52.326]  Never said it.
[02:22:52.406 --> 02:22:53.326]  No video, no nothing.
[02:22:54.166 --> 02:22:55.707]  It's summary judgment out of court.
[02:22:57.759 --> 02:23:02.022]  And the lawyers have just asked me, they said, Jones, just don't say what's wrong with the rest of it.
[02:23:02.503 --> 02:23:18.516]  Which I even, I'm not bragging, but I know the stuff well enough where I read these things and it's like, Owen Troyer said this, which he didn't say, and then Kit Daniels said that, so we're suing Owen Troyer, and then they just put the wrong name in the lawsuit in Travis County.
[02:23:19.056 --> 02:23:21.578]  And my lawyers are just like, stop, don't say it, just leave it alone.
[02:23:21.998 --> 02:23:25.141]  But I just can't sit here while they file all this crap,
[02:23:26.345 --> 02:23:30.128]  And they're not pointing out that it's absolute abject bull, but that's what's even scarier.
[02:23:31.749 --> 02:23:40.995]  Why would they file things in the wrong courts with typos all over them and defame people, putting the wrong names in it and stuff?
[02:23:41.055 --> 02:23:47.900]  I mean, it's... If they wanted to scare me, they've scared me in how inept they are.
[02:23:49.718 --> 02:23:51.619]  Because you want to think of your enemies as having their act together.
[02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:53.801]  These are servants of the globalists.
[02:23:54.101 --> 02:23:55.182]  Servants of Soros.
[02:23:55.942 --> 02:23:57.884]  Who do you think they're going to get?
[02:23:57.904 --> 02:24:04.048]  And that's the thing about us that are strong and those that have will and those of us that love God.
[02:24:05.629 --> 02:24:10.873]  We just continue to beat these people but not go on the offense.
[02:24:11.573 --> 02:24:15.016]  And we have to go on the offense and smoke them out of their holes, man.
[02:24:16.067 --> 02:24:17.688]  And they're going to call it vindictive.
[02:24:17.708 --> 02:24:20.369]  I mean, I already countersued them last week in Virginia.
[02:24:22.449 --> 02:24:23.510]  They withdrew the lawsuit.
[02:24:24.390 --> 02:24:28.471]  Because, I mean, we had them, like, dead to rights, man.
[02:24:29.692 --> 02:24:30.812]  I didn't just believe my law firm.
[02:24:30.852 --> 02:24:31.773]  I checked with three others.
[02:24:32.353 --> 02:24:35.894]  They said, we've never seen things this ridiculous.
[02:24:37.094 --> 02:24:38.235]  Because they're not even thinking.
[02:24:38.335 --> 02:24:41.176]  Look, up at Georgetown, I love folks on the East Coast and all that.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:46.043]  And that Vatican University over there has got it's new Pana for it's new boss.
[02:24:46.063 --> 02:24:49.545]  But they think in Texas that we wipe our asses with corn cobs.
[02:24:50.366 --> 02:24:54.329]  And they think like, we're just like married to our sister.
[02:24:54.369 --> 02:24:58.012]  We're like, them people in D.C.
[02:24:58.312 --> 02:24:59.593]  they didn't sue us.
[02:25:01.114 --> 02:25:02.796]  And then we like, get them.
[02:25:02.816 --> 02:25:04.977]  They're like, alert, alert, alert.
[02:25:05.778 --> 02:25:09.421]  But here's the deal, when I counter sued them a week and a half ago,
[02:25:11.491 --> 02:25:15.272]  ABC News was there, NBC, CBS, no coverage.
[02:25:15.732 --> 02:25:17.212]  Which is fine, we all had our own streams.
[02:25:21.914 --> 02:25:24.954]  But I told you, I said, I filed a lawsuit against Georgetown University.
[02:25:25.435 --> 02:25:27.235]  Well, how did they kill that lawsuit?
[02:25:28.435 --> 02:25:30.656]  That lawsuit was pursuant to their suit.
[02:25:33.328 --> 02:25:35.249]  And so now, they just pull the teeth out.
[02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:37.790]  And then who knows what they're gonna cook up.
[02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:38.811]  Because we're not stupid.
[02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:39.692]  They're gonna refile it.
[02:25:40.372 --> 02:25:40.892]  Why not?
[02:25:40.972 --> 02:25:42.233]  Get back on the merry-go-round.
[02:25:42.293 --> 02:25:43.093]  Put a quarter in.
[02:25:43.414 --> 02:25:44.514]  Say you're suing Alex Jones.
[02:25:44.534 --> 02:25:45.495]  Get all over the news.
[02:25:45.855 --> 02:25:47.116]  Defame him however you want.
[02:25:47.496 --> 02:25:48.716]  Say whatever you want about him.
[02:25:49.257 --> 02:25:50.197]  Put another quarter in.
[02:25:50.477 --> 02:25:51.178]  Do it again.
[02:25:51.338 --> 02:25:53.639]  Yee mommy, I wanna ride on the ferris wheel again.
[02:25:53.959 --> 02:25:56.241]  Mommy, I wanna ride on the big ship again.
[02:25:56.321 --> 02:25:58.842]  I wanna ride on the little horsies again.
[02:25:59.062 --> 02:26:00.003]  On the merry-go-round.
[02:26:00.763 --> 02:26:03.345]  Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I want to lie about Alex again!
[02:26:03.365 --> 02:26:05.327]  I want to kick America in the head again!
[02:26:05.347 --> 02:26:10.831]  Because we see him as Americana, and Daddy Soros squat and took a crap on him, and he's God!
[02:26:11.111 --> 02:26:13.873]  Mommy, Alex didn't go away when Soros crapped on him!
[02:26:14.353 --> 02:26:15.795]  Soros is a good Nazi!
[02:26:16.035 --> 02:26:17.256]  He killed a lot of people!
[02:26:17.516 --> 02:26:18.377]  He's powerful!
[02:26:18.637 --> 02:26:20.118]  Why doesn't Alex go away?
[02:26:20.398 --> 02:26:21.459]  Haven't we threatened him?
[02:26:21.819 --> 02:26:23.841]  Doesn't he roll over and piss all over himself?
[02:26:27.028 --> 02:26:31.712]  You look, you go to a university now, you go to anywhere left a star, they look like dead zombies.
[02:26:32.172 --> 02:26:35.115]  Hunchback, dead-eyed, faces all drooping.
[02:26:35.135 --> 02:26:36.636]  Because they have no soul.
[02:26:37.057 --> 02:26:37.757]  They're empty.
[02:26:37.837 --> 02:26:39.519]  I think people are being born without souls now.
[02:26:40.139 --> 02:26:43.482]  And you see them and they're like these zombies everywhere.
[02:26:43.882 --> 02:26:46.244]  And it's just like, all I want to do is get away from them.
[02:26:46.565 --> 02:26:47.926]  And the more I fight them, the better I feel.
[02:26:48.985 --> 02:26:50.607]  It's not about monetary, it's not about my life.
[02:26:50.827 --> 02:26:56.634]  They could have a Globals with a gun to my head saying, deny freedom, deny Christ, or we're gonna blow your head off.
[02:26:56.694 --> 02:26:59.718]  I'd say, pull your trigger.
[02:27:00.439 --> 02:27:00.759]  Because.
[02:27:02.811 --> 02:27:03.672]  I am so fulfilled.
[02:27:03.852 --> 02:27:08.135]  I mean, it is just, and that's the frustration, is that people just knew the power of liberty.
[02:27:08.675 --> 02:27:09.716]  The power of God.
[02:27:09.776 --> 02:27:12.798]  I don't mean the fake churches or fake preachers trying to act like men.
[02:27:13.598 --> 02:27:15.920]  But they won't criticize anything the globalists are doing.
[02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:18.841]  They won't criticize any of their dehumanization operations.
[02:27:19.082 --> 02:27:25.286]  They just sit there in the church and talk about the Lord and how good they are and how you can be strong and how you can be upright.
[02:27:25.326 --> 02:27:31.610]  It's all a bunch of Pharisees that Christ talked about up there telling you how high and mighty they are.
[02:27:36.314 --> 02:27:37.074]  And they're frauds.
[02:27:37.274 --> 02:27:38.395]  They're the sellouts.
[02:27:38.535 --> 02:27:45.777]  They're the people that signed on to the Globalist program to fill the place of the church so that they could bring down the whole system.
[02:27:47.217 --> 02:27:48.578]  So we'll go to break and go right to your calls.
[02:27:48.618 --> 02:27:53.039]  Sean, Daryl, Ian, Lauren, Cameron, and others.
[02:27:54.019 --> 02:27:55.340]  Pastor Sam, Austin.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:56.800]  Pastor Sam's called before.
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:57.781]  It's for some callers.
[02:27:58.201 --> 02:27:58.621]  We'll see.
[02:27:59.281 --> 02:28:02.102]  Catherine, Craig, Jay, Marcus, Carol, and others.
[02:28:03.294 --> 02:28:06.058]  So we will take your calls on the other side of this break.
[02:28:06.599 --> 02:28:17.897]  There's just so much more here, but... I just... I fear failure.
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:23.562]  But man, I look at George Soros' kids, and I'm not trying to be mean to George Soros, just to be mean.
[02:28:24.442 --> 02:28:26.703]  I mean, the faces they make in every photo.
[02:28:26.723 --> 02:28:27.963]  You think, oh, that's just one photo.
[02:28:28.003 --> 02:28:29.304]  No, it's like Brian Stelter looks.
[02:28:29.344 --> 02:28:33.266]  It's like... It's like trying to act powerful.
[02:28:33.486 --> 02:28:37.527]  But it's not even like, when I do it, I'm doing a joke, but it still looks crazy and dangerous.
[02:28:37.888 --> 02:28:44.710]  With them, it's like a trying to act powerful and forceful, but it's like fake, and it's like, you're doing all this to try to be powerful.
[02:28:44.730 --> 02:28:45.951]  You could have innately been powerful.
[02:28:46.511 --> 02:28:49.773]  Let me make one of the faces that Alexander Soros makes.
[02:28:49.873 --> 02:28:59.518]  It's more like a... I mean, it's just like... It's just like the faces Hillary makes.
[02:28:59.538 --> 02:29:00.198]  It's disgusting.
[02:29:02.731 --> 02:29:05.914]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:06.374 --> 02:29:07.675]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:29:08.176 --> 02:29:19.606]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:29:20.387 --> 02:29:29.315]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:29:29.595 --> 02:29:40.425]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:29:40.925 --> 02:29:43.246]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:29:43.586 --> 02:29:44.946]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:29:45.326 --> 02:29:54.949]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:29:55.050 --> 02:29:57.210]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:29:57.730 --> 02:30:02.592]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:30:06.804 --> 02:30:18.648]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[02:30:19.288 --> 02:30:28.611]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[02:30:28.831 --> 02:30:33.653]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[02:30:34.153 --> 02:30:39.217]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads.
[02:30:39.237 --> 02:30:43.460]  The cobwebs go away and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:49.023]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up and the nutrition to wake them up.
[02:30:49.043 --> 02:30:50.585]  I mean, the brain is a physical organ.
[02:30:51.185 --> 02:30:57.489]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[02:30:57.529 --> 02:30:58.310]  Here's my problem.
[02:30:58.830 --> 02:31:07.263]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[02:31:07.683 --> 02:31:08.825]  I have the same issue.
[02:31:09.085 --> 02:31:09.266]  Yeah.
[02:31:09.866 --> 02:31:12.731]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[02:31:12.811 --> 02:31:14.473]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[02:31:15.434 --> 02:31:20.456]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[02:31:20.776 --> 02:31:26.037]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[02:31:26.217 --> 02:31:29.739]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[02:31:30.039 --> 02:31:31.459]  We went out with the top labs.
[02:31:31.639 --> 02:31:33.980]  We want the strongest concentrate.
[02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:40.321]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[02:31:40.361 --> 02:31:40.821]  This is key.
[02:31:40.841 --> 02:31:42.442]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[02:31:58.465 --> 02:31:59.886]  And you have inflammation of the brain.
[02:31:59.926 --> 02:32:01.447]  They call that something down the road.
[02:32:01.507 --> 02:32:03.949]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:05.971]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[02:32:06.011 --> 02:32:07.512]  They call that something else down the road.
[02:32:07.532 --> 02:32:12.936]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on, and they say, it's inflammation in the brain.
[02:32:13.336 --> 02:32:15.998]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[02:32:16.118 --> 02:32:16.799]  That's exactly right.
[02:32:17.179 --> 02:32:19.661]  Now, your product is an extract.
[02:32:20.081 --> 02:32:22.783]  And we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[02:32:23.023 --> 02:32:27.487]  We've done over 1,000 foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[02:32:28.087 --> 02:32:31.290]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:37.055]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[02:32:37.095 --> 02:32:38.756]  Well, that's another reason.
[02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:45.802]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals test if you don't.
[02:32:45.942 --> 02:32:46.362]  Exactly.
[02:32:46.482 --> 02:32:53.385]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[02:32:53.705 --> 02:32:58.207]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[02:33:06.170 --> 02:33:08.811]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.669 --> 02:33:28.811]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:29.312 --> 02:33:31.753]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.973 --> 02:33:37.636]  Chaos is hanging around.
[02:33:38.936 --> 02:33:43.698]  Put your ear to the ground and shut up from the sound.
[02:33:43.718 --> 02:33:49.001]  The death machine ain't slowing down, it's gaining ground.
[02:33:51.018 --> 02:33:54.940]  That is Shooter Jennings with one of his great songs, Summer of Rage.
[02:33:56.121 --> 02:34:05.286]  Another work inspired by the Info War.
[02:34:08.768 --> 02:34:09.609]  Police State.
[02:34:10.089 --> 02:34:11.510]  But that started getting derailed, didn't it?
[02:34:12.210 --> 02:34:12.871]  Hush, hush.
[02:34:23.943 --> 02:34:24.464]  That's right.
[02:34:24.544 --> 02:34:27.326]  Can't trust nothing but the love in your mother's eyes.
[02:34:30.688 --> 02:34:34.391]  The globalists claim they're trying to save the Earth with Jane Goodall and Earth Day.
[02:34:34.451 --> 02:34:37.012]  I stay in Google about carbon dioxide and all this.
[02:34:37.413 --> 02:34:38.413]  It's the genetic engineering.
[02:34:38.453 --> 02:34:39.374]  It's the toxic waste.
[02:34:39.794 --> 02:34:41.135]  That's the real threat to the planet.
[02:34:41.816 --> 02:34:44.518]  It's the nuclear reactors, but none of that from the left anymore.
[02:34:45.078 --> 02:34:48.460]  All about hating humans and banning plastic and that'll fix it all.
[02:34:48.721 --> 02:34:49.781]  Little sub-issues.
[02:34:51.082 --> 02:34:53.384]  All right, I'm going to your phone calls, but here's an announcement.
[02:34:55.603 --> 02:35:08.027]  We filed a week and a half ago in DC, as you know, a slapback suit on Georgetown University and the individual they got to file the suit, claiming that I said that the person that filed the suit killed a woman that got killed.
[02:35:08.067 --> 02:35:12.789]  No, I said Soros funding Antifa, which is on record, helped create the climate that got the woman killed.
[02:35:13.309 --> 02:35:15.330]  So it's just a total fraud lawsuit.
[02:35:16.170 --> 02:35:18.611]  I've had three different law firms, four different law firms look at it.
[02:35:18.631 --> 02:35:20.712]  One of them is one of the top firms in the country.
[02:35:21.926 --> 02:35:23.147]  So we filed a countersuit.
[02:35:23.467 --> 02:35:25.888]  Zero corporate media, fake news media coverage.
[02:35:26.968 --> 02:35:33.211]  They just got a call and they're putting in the filing either today or tomorrow to withdraw the lawsuit.
[02:35:33.231 --> 02:35:34.091]  Georgetown will withdraw it.
[02:35:35.672 --> 02:35:40.434]  Because they filed a piece of fiction.
[02:35:41.354 --> 02:35:43.355]  But here's the legal prediction.
[02:35:46.192 --> 02:35:50.857]  They're just gonna refile it without all the errors, but it doesn't matter because the basis of it's an error.
[02:35:51.178 --> 02:35:53.981]  And then you'll hear, Georgetown files a new suit!
[02:35:54.341 --> 02:35:57.966]  And the media, you will witness them, watch the next few days, I'm predicting this.
[02:35:59.107 --> 02:36:05.635]  When they refile it, where we're guessing they will, they'll just say it's a whole new lawsuit.
[02:36:06.761 --> 02:36:14.706]  Like it's another one hitting me, and yet a whole nother cycle that Jones is losing, the Liberty Movement's losing, Soros and Hillary are winning, the world government's winning.
[02:36:15.046 --> 02:36:15.926]  Intimidate everybody.
[02:36:16.187 --> 02:36:19.549]  That's all they've got because they're the losers, they're the fraud, they're the globalists.
[02:36:19.789 --> 02:36:21.450]  Everybody hates them, said to do all this.
[02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:27.353]  You're racist, you're Russian, you bullied me, you did this, to keep it in the news like they're victims.
[02:36:27.593 --> 02:36:29.895]  But everyone tunes into that and knows it's fake news!
[02:36:31.416 --> 02:36:33.457]  And we have seen an uptick in support for the broadcast.
[02:36:34.557 --> 02:36:36.998]  I hope it's enough to deal with all this because it's intensifying.
[02:36:37.038 --> 02:36:37.899]  But thank you for your support.
[02:36:37.919 --> 02:36:38.599]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:36:38.639 --> 02:36:39.620]  But here's the thing.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:53.828]  When they realize they've got to pay attorney's fees and damages for the false suit, they stuck their arm in that badger's nest and tried to pull it out real fast.
[02:36:55.529 --> 02:36:59.091]  And you can't polish a turd.
[02:36:59.151 --> 02:37:01.993]  So good luck with whatever else you cook up because I don't think they're going to give up.
[02:37:03.015 --> 02:37:04.415]  You don't just think they're dropping it, do you?
[02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:06.156]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:08.157 --> 02:37:16.059]  I don't think they're going to want to have the law students, the type of liberals that don't want an actual real job, they'll be professors for life.
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:19.740]  I mean, you might not want to have them write the next one, you know.
[02:37:20.281 --> 02:37:23.382]  It's like these ones in Austin, it's got defamation and all that.
[02:37:23.402 --> 02:37:25.342]  They'll just randomly put somebody's name in there.
[02:37:25.362 --> 02:37:27.523]  It wasn't even involved in the suit, they just throw it in there.
[02:37:30.157 --> 02:37:33.119]  I'll tell you, it's like monkeys at the zoo throwing you know what at you.
[02:37:33.139 --> 02:37:36.042]  I mean, it's just like that, and you're like, what is this?
[02:37:36.302 --> 02:37:37.643]  Because the media doesn't care.
[02:37:37.663 --> 02:37:44.688]  They want the suit to say we're losing and we're being destroyed, and then when we file suits on them, or they withdraw lawsuits, you won't be in the controlled press.
[02:37:46.530 --> 02:37:48.831]  Because it's all about deceiving the public.
[02:37:53.315 --> 02:37:53.735]  Cameron.
[02:37:54.856 --> 02:37:55.136]  Ian.
[02:37:55.717 --> 02:37:56.077]  Sean.
[02:37:59.497 --> 02:38:00.798]  Let's talk to Sean in Arizona.
[02:38:00.838 --> 02:38:02.460]  It's a grab bag, whatever topic you want to discuss.
[02:38:02.820 --> 02:38:06.043]  Sean says, what he witnessed during Clinton vacations in 96.
[02:38:06.263 --> 02:38:07.524]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:38:08.085 --> 02:38:15.832]  Well, that's true, but there's a couple other things here, Alex, and I'm on the ranch here between outbuildings, you know how it is, and I didn't hear
[02:38:16.491 --> 02:38:16.811]  I think so.
[02:38:36.298 --> 02:38:44.006]  To go against an entity in the motion picture business in a western state, west of Texas, in one of the far western states.
[02:38:44.466 --> 02:38:46.248]  You may recall I've got Lyme disease.
[02:38:46.288 --> 02:38:57.459]  The last five and a half years I've spent at my computer, to the detriment of my health, because I should have been working on my Lyme disease protocols every day, but freedom is not free.
[02:38:57.539 --> 02:38:59.160]  I put together a case, 35 booklets, 1300 pages.
[02:39:01.451 --> 02:39:01.852]  I don't know.
[02:39:19.034 --> 02:39:21.977]  Uh, on a constitutional lawyer and organization.
[02:39:22.037 --> 02:39:23.138]  It's been very difficult.
[02:39:23.198 --> 02:39:26.180]  I just don't want to hand this case off to, to Justin.
[02:39:26.641 --> 02:39:27.261]  Here's my problem.
[02:39:27.341 --> 02:39:29.523]  I can barely deal with my own stuff and I'm here live on air.
[02:39:29.563 --> 02:39:35.308]  I can't conduct, you know, off the record discussions about stuff here on air, sir.
[02:39:35.328 --> 02:39:35.308]  96.
[02:39:35.348 --> 02:39:38.651]  And what most people don't know is, uh, Blintons were there in 95 and 96 and in 96
[02:39:41.897 --> 02:39:43.438]  They lost a whole plane up there.
[02:39:44.459 --> 02:39:46.680]  It was a C-130 cargo plane.
[02:39:47.121 --> 02:39:47.601]  It flew.
[02:39:48.482 --> 02:39:52.845]  It was the last plane that left on the last part of the vacation in 96.
[02:39:53.005 --> 02:39:54.626]  It flew into the mountain up there.
[02:39:54.866 --> 02:39:57.708]  Nobody talks about it, but they lost everybody in that plane.
[02:39:57.948 --> 02:40:00.870]  Had the nuclear football on it.
[02:40:01.050 --> 02:40:02.971]  They slammed into Sleeping Indian Mountain.
[02:40:03.052 --> 02:40:08.215]  And it's another thing of a lot of people, for one reason or another, that perished around the Clintons.
[02:40:08.295 --> 02:40:09.556]  When Clinton golfed,
[02:40:10.222 --> 02:40:22.395]  When the boy, Bill Clinton, golfed in Jackson Hole, he golfed with a business owner that was one of the biggest loaders in his nose in the whole Teton County, Wyoming.
[02:40:22.455 --> 02:40:26.059]  And after Bill Clinton left, he was his golfing partner for 96.
[02:40:26.099 --> 02:40:27.561]  When Clinton left, he threw a bash.
[02:40:31.787 --> 02:40:34.307]  For the Secret Service and that, at this guy's business.
[02:40:34.467 --> 02:40:44.989]  And shortly afterward, this guy had to go down and check in at a ranch next to Merv Griffin or whatever in Wickenburg, where they did for addiction, for drug addiction.
[02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:51.850]  And they flew, this is, they flew because people told me that we're on the security deal.
[02:40:52.271 --> 02:40:55.311]  They flew in a girlfriend for Hillary.
[02:40:55.391 --> 02:40:57.651]  So, we've got to put the pressure on.
[02:40:58.192 --> 02:41:00.892]  These people are minions of the Antichrist.
[02:41:01.517 --> 02:41:03.679]  And they need to be defeated, and I wish you the best.
[02:41:04.219 --> 02:41:05.000]  God bless you, Sean.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:06.081]  I appreciate the call.
[02:41:08.503 --> 02:41:09.964]  Okay, let's go to another caller here.
[02:41:09.984 --> 02:41:13.787]  Let's talk to Craig in New Mexico.
[02:41:13.867 --> 02:41:14.608]  Craig in New Mexico.
[02:41:14.648 --> 02:41:14.968]  Go ahead.
[02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:18.351]  Hi, are you there, Alex?
[02:41:18.591 --> 02:41:19.211]  I sure am.
[02:41:20.412 --> 02:41:22.254]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[02:41:23.155 --> 02:41:24.536]  I'm calling today.
[02:41:25.096 --> 02:41:30.741]  I'm a long-time InfoWars listener, over ten years now, and I'm also a
[02:41:32.284 --> 02:41:35.126]  Thank you sir, I appreciate the support.
[02:41:35.967 --> 02:41:37.047]  You're welcome, my pleasure.
[02:41:38.768 --> 02:41:46.553]  In 2011, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after a cascade of debilitating symptoms.
[02:41:48.334 --> 02:41:55.599]  After an ineffective steroid regimen and also being asked to become a
[02:41:56.294 --> 02:42:02.138]  I'm a guinea pig for the pharmaceutical companies and taking new untested MS drugs.
[02:42:03.178 --> 02:42:05.900]  I opted out to become a medical cannabis patient.
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:11.663]  And as of recently, with Jeff Sessions' rhetoric, I've been very concerned.
[02:42:12.144 --> 02:42:24.311]  Now that being said, I commend President Trump on his recent pledge to Senator Cory Gardner to respect the Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[02:42:24.913 --> 02:42:27.334]  As regards to medical and recreational cannabis.
[02:42:27.354 --> 02:42:31.635]  Yeah, he's reversing the mad dog sessions that does whatever he wants.
[02:42:32.375 --> 02:42:33.235]  And that's really good news.
[02:42:33.255 --> 02:42:36.676]  But I've seen the big studies on inflammation and issues.
[02:42:36.716 --> 02:42:40.277]  Now marijuana works so much better, THC, than other things.
[02:42:40.297 --> 02:42:41.498]  So that's a good thing Trump's doing.
[02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:41.938]  Thank you, Greg.
[02:42:42.478 --> 02:42:43.980]  We're gonna go BAM BAM BAM with more calls.
[02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:50.226]  Austin in Tennessee, Catherine in Canada, Jay in California, Marcus in Texas, Carol in Pennsylvania, Daryl and so many others.
[02:42:50.586 --> 02:42:54.310]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:54.851]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.271 --> 02:42:57.093]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:42:57.113 --> 02:43:00.997]  It's just good to see Mel Brooks and everybody coming out against political correctness.
[02:43:05.418 --> 02:43:06.839]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:06.879 --> 02:43:08.320]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:08.740]  Go ahead.
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:09.161]  Yes.
[02:43:09.561 --> 02:43:10.281]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:10.401 --> 02:43:16.586]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:16.806 --> 02:43:20.789]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:21.009 --> 02:43:22.470]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:29.775]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[02:43:30.055 --> 02:43:32.696]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:32.756 --> 02:43:36.158]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:43:36.458 --> 02:43:38.039]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:38.079 --> 02:43:45.423]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[02:43:45.443 --> 02:43:45.923]  So, thank you.
[02:43:45.943 --> 02:43:51.766]  But when you mention the Silver Bullock Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:51.906 --> 02:43:53.387]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[02:43:53.607 --> 02:43:57.171]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:43:57.191 --> 02:44:00.314]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet.
[02:44:02.196 --> 02:44:02.777]  Alpha Power.
[02:44:03.057 --> 02:44:06.661]  Vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:44:06.781 --> 02:44:15.069]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:15.149 --> 02:44:16.771]  But, here's what you wanna know.
[02:44:17.722 --> 02:44:23.685]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:24.345 --> 02:44:27.886]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:28.767 --> 02:44:36.770]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:37.350 --> 02:44:45.014]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:45.814 --> 02:44:49.602]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:50.164 --> 02:44:54.112]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:55.194 --> 02:45:10.070]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:10.490 --> 02:45:15.836]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:16.156 --> 02:45:17.698]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you
[02:45:17.998 --> 02:45:19.318]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:45:19.338 --> 02:45:23.919]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alva Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:24.479 --> 02:45:28.780]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:30.140]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.181]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:37.561 --> 02:45:39.622]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:40.202 --> 02:45:41.782]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:41.802 --> 02:45:42.942]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:42.982 --> 02:45:44.643]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:45:47.543 --> 02:45:48.404]  But here's an example.
[02:45:49.224 --> 02:45:56.288]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:56.829 --> 02:45:58.550]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:59.010 --> 02:46:05.194]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:05.874 --> 02:46:10.959]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:11.259 --> 02:46:19.588]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:19.988 --> 02:46:21.029]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:21.109 --> 02:46:23.772]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:24.272 --> 02:46:40.431]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:40.831 --> 02:46:49.799]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:50.159 --> 02:46:52.161]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:52.561 --> 02:46:57.845]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:46:57.865 --> 02:46:58.306]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:58.526 --> 02:46:59.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.675 --> 02:47:21.019]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's swaying the sea.
[02:47:21.119 --> 02:47:25.242]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:47:25.382 --> 02:47:27.503]  He never gives up.
[02:47:27.623 --> 02:47:33.707]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:47:38.983 --> 02:47:57.634]  They told me about this 45 minutes ago and I didn't jump on it because all there was was a report and they gave me the article of a van running over a bunch of people in Toronto.
[02:48:02.791 --> 02:48:15.782]  Then I read the new reports that just came out during this segment, and it looks like dozens and dozens of people, including babies and strollers, run over painstakingly, premeditatedly, by the religion of peace.
[02:48:17.143 --> 02:48:22.588]  They'll probably spend days blocking the identity of the male taken into custody.
[02:48:23.849 --> 02:48:24.890]  See, that's why I couldn't be a cop.
[02:48:24.930 --> 02:48:29.334]  If I watched somebody run over a bunch of babies and women and stuff, I'd, you know, you're not going into custody.
[02:48:33.086 --> 02:48:35.807]  This is CTV News out of Canada.
[02:48:37.007 --> 02:48:41.108]  Witness van struck every single thing on Toronto's sidewalk.
[02:48:41.868 --> 02:48:45.609]  And the answer is bring in more Muslims, put barriers up.
[02:48:45.649 --> 02:48:46.629]  That's the media's answer.
[02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:53.030]  Police have arrested a suspect after a white van mounted the curb and struck numerous pedestrians in Toronto.
[02:48:53.410 --> 02:48:59.131]  The incident happened on Yonge Street, south of Finch Avenue, according to the Toronto Police Service.
[02:48:59.811 --> 02:49:02.312]  Initial estimates suggest 8 to 10 people were struck.
[02:49:03.223 --> 02:49:08.886]  Witness Alex Shaker, who was driving southbound at the time, says he saw a van traveling at high speed on a sidewalk.
[02:49:09.186 --> 02:49:10.747]  The van was also southbound.
[02:49:11.287 --> 02:49:18.350]  He started going down the sidewalk and crumbling down people one by one, Shaker told CTV News Channel on Monday afternoon.
[02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:21.832]  Shaker said he saw the vehicle strike someone with a stroller.
[02:49:22.654 --> 02:49:24.235]  Well, under Islam, that's a bonus.
[02:49:24.956 --> 02:49:25.416]  Bonus point.
[02:49:25.856 --> 02:49:28.058]  But if you weren't being Islamophobic, I'm sorry.
[02:49:28.078 --> 02:49:30.320]  That's why all the Islamists want to get out of their own countries and come here.
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:35.844]  But he just destroyed so many people's lives, he said, every single thing that got in its way.
[02:49:38.666 --> 02:49:39.887]  And then it just goes on from there.
[02:49:44.651 --> 02:49:47.533]  I think, to be more open to Islam, we should
[02:49:49.397 --> 02:50:02.937]  Like bowling pins have preschools go into Islamic areas and just like bowling pins line the kids up like pins and then it can be a new Islamic sport for America's guilt and they just get a truck and just ram the kids.
[02:50:04.568 --> 02:50:10.330]  And then Tom Arnold can tell you any conservative black activist women should suck, you know, people's genitals.
[02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:13.151]  It's all, again, kill people, suck genitals, you know.
[02:50:13.431 --> 02:50:14.772]  As long as the left does it, it's cute.
[02:50:15.692 --> 02:50:20.934]  All giant Stockholm Syndrome trying to train us how to submit to all this, and Europe submitting to all of it.
[02:50:21.194 --> 02:50:22.014]  It's truly sick.
[02:50:22.514 --> 02:50:25.875]  Tom Arnold, you know, telling Candace Owens, you know, suck, you know what?
[02:50:25.915 --> 02:50:27.016]  It's all just sick.
[02:50:27.516 --> 02:50:28.176]  Just sick.
[02:50:28.556 --> 02:50:28.996]  Bullies.
[02:50:31.357 --> 02:50:32.478]  And then I got another story here.
[02:50:34.693 --> 02:50:36.593]  Waffle House government's been taken into custody.
[02:50:36.633 --> 02:50:42.895]  He had his AR-15 seized months ago by the FBI, but that never stops a lunatic who should be in a mental asylum, right?
[02:50:43.695 --> 02:50:45.295]  But good guys with guns stopped him.
[02:50:45.895 --> 02:50:47.316]  So there's that report, that's good news.
[02:50:49.776 --> 02:50:53.077]  But what have you heard you really even disagree with in the last hour of your listening?
[02:50:53.657 --> 02:50:55.517]  Why does this show need to be banned because of Hillary?
[02:50:57.938 --> 02:50:59.618]  Because we're not good for tyrants, that's why.
[02:51:03.953 --> 02:51:05.654]  Let's talk to Cameron in Florida.
[02:51:05.734 --> 02:51:07.095]  Cameron in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:51:07.115 --> 02:51:10.297]  And then we'll go to Marcus, we'll go to Jay and others.
[02:51:10.317 --> 02:51:11.458]  Go ahead Cameron, thanks for calling.
[02:51:12.372 --> 02:51:14.874]  Brother Alex Jones, so happy to be back on the show again.
[02:51:14.894 --> 02:51:17.896]  Make sure you get in touch with your staff about the Haiti emails and whatnot.
[02:51:17.916 --> 02:51:24.001]  When I went over to Haiti with the Son of God Orphanage, you have seen the enemy, I have seen the enemy, and they know of us.
[02:51:24.601 --> 02:51:25.702]  And so look into that.
[02:51:26.883 --> 02:51:28.925]  So you've sent us emails about what you saw in Haiti.
[02:51:28.965 --> 02:51:35.169]  Tell us about that briefly and I'll, we have a limited staff and I'm trying to, all this great stuff coming, we'll try to flag it and look at it.
[02:51:35.189 --> 02:51:35.690]  What did you see?
[02:51:36.733 --> 02:51:37.194]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:37.294 --> 02:51:44.323]  So there's an orphanage called the Son of God Orphanage that was being used as a child sex trafficking and organ harvesting center.
[02:51:44.683 --> 02:51:46.325]  I had it running with the United Nations.
[02:51:46.365 --> 02:51:49.729]  They were not there with a bottle of the water or food.
[02:51:50.310 --> 02:51:51.732]  They were there with the machine guns.
[02:51:51.792 --> 02:51:53.814]  That's all in itself.
[02:51:53.834 --> 02:51:54.956]  We can talk about that more.
[02:51:55.496 --> 02:52:02.858]  But your resorts that you talked about, you can do those resorts just with land, God, and a good message with good people.
[02:52:03.398 --> 02:52:04.978]  Let it be reboot camps.
[02:52:05.078 --> 02:52:18.742]  Ted Nugent can help you get those things where people can reprogram and break the conditioning and get people on a local level, on a mass scale, to really change their home, their community, and then as a nation, because I'm on this Trump chain.
[02:52:18.762 --> 02:52:20.482]  Daria says she's looking into your info.
[02:52:20.502 --> 02:52:22.523]  The producer just popped in my ear, but let me tell you this.
[02:52:23.410 --> 02:52:24.411]  I'm not saying you're a bad guy.
[02:52:24.431 --> 02:52:25.232]  You sound really great.
[02:52:25.753 --> 02:52:27.915]  I know Hillary's people got caught shipping kids out.
[02:52:28.276 --> 02:52:30.198]  Haiti's been used for all sorts of Satanism.
[02:52:30.238 --> 02:52:30.879]  That's confirmed.
[02:52:31.339 --> 02:52:34.663]  I don't know about the Son of God orphanage, but you'll say that I'm saying this about him.
[02:52:35.063 --> 02:52:36.105]  Have there been any arrests?
[02:52:36.165 --> 02:52:36.845]  Any indictments?
[02:52:36.905 --> 02:52:40.730]  I mean, I know a lot of this stuff goes on in Haiti, but I'm flying blind here.
[02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:42.011]  I mean, has it been in the news?
[02:52:42.111 --> 02:52:44.214]  I mean, what's happened according to what you're saying as a caller?
[02:52:44.434 --> 02:52:46.575]  This is why they hate talk radio, is it gives you a voice.
[02:52:46.956 --> 02:52:48.957]  It's just that I'm sitting up here under a microscope.
[02:52:49.257 --> 02:52:51.138]  They'll then say what my callers say I'm saying.
[02:52:51.198 --> 02:52:52.419]  I don't know about the son who got orphanaged.
[02:52:52.739 --> 02:52:58.403]  I know about Hillary's people caught shipping kids out, getting indicted, getting convicted after conviction.
[02:52:58.423 --> 02:52:59.343]  They changed their name.
[02:52:59.584 --> 02:53:01.285]  They're involved with kids orphanages again.
[02:53:01.305 --> 02:53:07.709]  So we know that Hillary and their whole crime syndicate have a real taste for Haitian blood for whatever reason.
[02:53:08.843 --> 02:53:10.144]  And the Haitian people know that.
[02:53:10.224 --> 02:53:13.607]  It's not just about what they did over there with minerals.
[02:53:13.627 --> 02:53:14.668]  Oh, there it is, NBC.
[02:53:14.809 --> 02:53:17.371]  Haiti closes orphanages for child neglect after complaints.
[02:53:17.451 --> 02:53:18.432]  Okay, keep going.
[02:53:18.612 --> 02:53:19.733]  I was there.
[02:53:20.053 --> 02:53:21.114]  You have pictures.
[02:53:21.134 --> 02:53:23.577]  I think it'll all be confirmed, okay?
[02:53:23.677 --> 02:53:27.740]  Anyway, also, anytime you call somebody out... No, but you understand I've got to challenge you.
[02:53:28.021 --> 02:53:29.342]  And I always have challenged you.
[02:53:30.102 --> 02:53:34.765]  100%.
[02:53:30.142 --> 02:53:34.765]  They're coming after your free speech just like all of ours, but everything that I'm saying can be confirmed.
[02:53:35.245 --> 02:53:36.105]  The crazier it sounds.
[02:53:36.145 --> 02:53:39.147]  You say the truth is stranger than fiction, and brother, it really is.
[02:53:39.187 --> 02:53:40.788]  These people need to wake up.
[02:53:41.168 --> 02:53:46.731]  No, it says they were arrested for child trafficking and it goes through it.
[02:53:46.771 --> 02:53:47.331]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:53:48.078 --> 02:53:49.999]  And there were zero arrests.
[02:53:50.039 --> 02:53:54.641]  There were people who were brought forward, but there were no true official arrests.
[02:53:55.441 --> 02:53:57.362]  And there's details... Well, you've been there.
[02:53:57.402 --> 02:53:58.283]  You sent us photos.
[02:53:58.303 --> 02:53:59.983]  You sent us videos, I'm told, by Daria.
[02:54:00.003 --> 02:54:01.984]  We're going to get you on then, my friend.
[02:54:02.044 --> 02:54:02.645]  God bless you.
[02:54:03.585 --> 02:54:06.466]  But now shifting gears into Cohen's office getting raided.
[02:54:06.506 --> 02:54:07.527]  What's your take on that?
[02:54:08.439 --> 02:54:15.221]  Okay, all the real Trumpers are like so terrified because this happened, but listen, this truly shows that they are absolutely desperate.
[02:54:15.741 --> 02:54:17.722]  The Russian collusion is no longer a story.
[02:54:18.002 --> 02:54:23.784]  They're doing everything they can, but Trump, the master strategist, is not going to have any type of thing in his lawyer's office.
[02:54:23.804 --> 02:54:28.125]  These people are so screwed, and military tribunals are coming in the name of Jesus.
[02:54:28.325 --> 02:54:28.885]  It's happening.
[02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:30.286]  Law and order back in America.
[02:54:31.832 --> 02:54:35.113]  I hear you, but as strong as Trump can be, what should we do?
[02:54:35.133 --> 02:54:35.633]  Let me tell you.
[02:54:36.153 --> 02:54:42.295]  The globalists are in full force attack, and the average libertarian or Christian, I know, they think everything's okay.
[02:54:42.315 --> 02:54:44.296]  They don't get the maximum battle is on.
[02:54:44.636 --> 02:54:46.537]  We just stirred up the hornet's nest in 2016.
[02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:49.140]  We're good.
[02:55:05.587 --> 02:55:08.469]  Well, you're on fire.
[02:55:08.809 --> 02:55:15.693]  I like what you're saying, Cameron.
[02:55:15.733 --> 02:55:16.513]  We'll learn more about you.
[02:55:16.533 --> 02:55:17.874]  We'll get your info, try to get you on as a guest.
[02:55:18.214 --> 02:55:19.035]  Great job going to Haiti.
[02:55:19.055 --> 02:55:20.395]  We've sent our folks down there, too.
[02:55:21.036 --> 02:55:22.196]  It is just unbelievable.
[02:55:22.397 --> 02:55:26.899]  I mean, it is just unbelievable how the left particularly has a taste for Haitian blood.
[02:55:27.539 --> 02:55:28.200]  I mean, literally.
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:29.900]  And it's just God they're evil.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:37.442]  I can't believe these average leftists call us Nazis and call us names when they are like right under pure evil.
[02:55:37.482 --> 02:55:39.042]  They are serving pure evil.
[02:55:39.062 --> 02:55:39.863]  God bless you, Cameron.
[02:55:41.363 --> 02:55:42.543]  Okay, who's up next here?
[02:55:42.943 --> 02:55:46.924]  Let's go to Jay in California since we're on the subject of Sessions and Cohen and all this.
[02:55:47.544 --> 02:55:48.425]  Or Jay just hung up.
[02:55:48.885 --> 02:55:49.365]  Is Jay there?
[02:55:49.625 --> 02:55:50.105]  Razza went to him.
[02:55:50.125 --> 02:55:50.485]  He hung up.
[02:55:51.805 --> 02:55:52.706]  Just hung up, okay.
[02:55:54.686 --> 02:55:56.487]  Let's talk to Lauren in California.
[02:55:56.527 --> 02:55:57.207]  Lauren, you're on the air.
[02:55:57.267 --> 02:55:57.787]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:57.807 --> 02:55:58.047]  Go ahead.
[02:55:59.693 --> 02:56:01.054]  Hey Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[02:56:01.154 --> 02:56:02.174]  I'm just going to make this quick.
[02:56:02.714 --> 02:56:03.675]  I'm 28 years old.
[02:56:03.955 --> 02:56:04.935]  I've been a longtime listener.
[02:56:04.955 --> 02:56:05.896]  I've been listening since I was 14.
[02:56:06.396 --> 02:56:10.598]  I was turned on by my brother, who thinks you're a double agent now, which is pretty hilarious.
[02:56:10.658 --> 02:56:14.199]  But anyway, at my age, I'm self-employed.
[02:56:14.219 --> 02:56:16.020]  I own my own business, and I really
[02:56:16.781 --> 02:56:24.224]  Give credit to all my entrepreneurship to InfoWars and you guys, and I just really want to help out and give back.
[02:56:24.484 --> 02:56:37.089]  And so what I did is I created a website called InfoWarsOutpost.com, and it's a way for people like me who want to do more in their daily lives but can't because they're so busy, can.
[02:56:37.169 --> 02:56:43.792]  If you own a business or manage a business and you play TV or you have anything broadcasting, you play InfoWars instead.
[02:56:43.812 --> 02:56:44.712]  You play your broadcast.
[02:56:45.319 --> 02:56:46.340]  And that's how you're an outpost.
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:52.806]  Basically, you're the main force, and we as InfoWarriors need to start setting up outposts and establish them to help you out.
[02:56:52.826 --> 02:57:02.775]  And people should know, just watching the show on your TV or computer drives it up in the ratings, but you can also put a little FM transmitter in, broadcast your neighborhood, put up little signs or whatever.
[02:57:02.815 --> 02:57:03.796]  I mean, is that what you're getting at?
[02:57:05.151 --> 02:57:13.455]  Well, basically just, um, if you own like an art shop, you know, or a coffee shop, and you have TV playing, instead of having... By the way, your site looks great.
[02:57:13.475 --> 02:57:14.996]  I need to hire you to build us some websites.
[02:57:15.796 --> 02:57:17.197]  InfoWarsOutpost.com
[02:57:18.123 --> 02:57:23.847]  Yeah, basically the idea, like I said, is you guys are the main force, and your information is so crucial it needs to get out there.
[02:57:24.288 --> 02:57:34.896]  So, you know, if you own a coffee shop or an art shop, it doesn't matter what it is, you know, and you have TV playing, you play your broadcast instead of having CNN or MSNBC playing in the background.
[02:57:35.376 --> 02:57:37.518]  Hey, get Lauren's number.
[02:57:37.578 --> 02:57:40.240]  I want to get him on as a guest, talk more about M4's outpost.
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:42.041]  Let's get him on The War Room or my show.
[02:57:42.081 --> 02:57:42.802]  That's really exciting.
[02:57:43.022 --> 02:57:45.404]  And it's things like that that add up and defeat the globalists.
[02:57:45.444 --> 02:57:46.825]  If we do things grassroots,
[02:57:47.306 --> 02:57:47.668]  It's over.
[02:57:47.688 --> 02:57:49.759]  They're trying to destroy us to intimidate you.
[02:57:49.799 --> 02:57:50.322]  Thank you, Lauren.
[02:57:54.421 --> 02:58:12.710]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:12.811 --> 02:58:18.413]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:58:19.094 --> 02:58:19.774]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:20.214 --> 02:58:23.056]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:58:23.696 --> 02:58:24.657]  And so much more.
[02:58:25.237 --> 02:58:26.378]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:26.598 --> 02:58:28.319]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:28.419 --> 02:58:34.023]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:34.123 --> 02:58:35.344]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:35.484 --> 02:58:37.285]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:37.365 --> 02:58:39.746]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:39.946 --> 02:58:41.207]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:41.387 --> 02:58:43.208]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:58:43.769 --> 02:58:44.369]  Immune Wall.

[03:00:52.956 --> 03:00:54.996]  Let's talk to Marcus in Texas, then Daryl.
[03:00:55.337 --> 03:00:56.517]  Marcus, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:58.338 --> 03:01:07.102]  Okay, so what I think's going on with this, um, with this, because you and Zach had talked about the, the potential for ISIS false flags, and then what does ISIS do?
[03:01:07.162 --> 03:01:14.746]  They put out a video, or a little picture, rather, of... They're going to target CNN, the UN, and yeah, exactly.
[03:01:14.986 --> 03:01:16.446]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:16.606 --> 03:01:19.607]  And so, what do all those things have in common, too?
[03:01:20.047 --> 03:01:22.388]  As well as they are the globalists, they represent the globalists.
[03:01:22.788 --> 03:01:32.510]  It's the all-info warriors, and believe it or not, there's a lot of mush-minded people who happen to have chosen the right side, but don't really know why, or are easily swayed.
[03:01:32.610 --> 03:01:35.331]  It just makes the globalists the good guys.
[03:01:36.414 --> 03:01:37.154]  Right, right.
[03:01:37.415 --> 03:01:42.517]  And it's going to make certain people say, oh wow, ISIS is sexy.
[03:01:42.537 --> 03:01:44.558]  They're already trying to make ISIS sexy.
[03:01:44.578 --> 03:01:45.859]  They've been doing it with the Antifa.
[03:01:46.299 --> 03:01:47.940]  And it's a stupid move.
[03:01:48.020 --> 03:01:50.061]  It's not going to work, especially if we talk about it.
[03:01:50.421 --> 03:02:00.406]  But just like Kim had said last week, a caller that called in about how they're trying to confuse people and use you as a litmus test to get
[03:02:01.084 --> 03:02:07.411]  Get everybody, you know, if this is said and then Alex Jones is associated with it, then that topic gets immediately killed and made stupid.
[03:02:07.451 --> 03:02:09.053]  But that's not going to work.
[03:02:09.394 --> 03:02:20.747]  But as a young black American who just loves liberty and feels the resurgence of liberty, I can only say that we need to be more like Candace Owens and black people and stand up.
[03:02:21.087 --> 03:02:24.348]  Because that's what's going to smash the paradigm, as well as white people standing up.
[03:02:24.368 --> 03:02:28.810]  Because they can say, oh yeah, you're racist if you cheer on something that's being said, and you're white.
[03:02:28.830 --> 03:02:36.594]  But if you're black, like Kanye, and you're black like Candace Owens, and you're black like Tim Black, or whatever, there's no way they can stop you.
[03:02:36.614 --> 03:02:39.875]  I was about to say, I don't like racist white people, I don't like racist black people.
[03:02:39.895 --> 03:02:42.316]  It's just stupid, like Kanye West said.
[03:02:42.356 --> 03:02:43.117]  He's got a lot of courage.
[03:02:43.877 --> 03:02:48.060]  Yeah, it goes on, but it's a system of mental illness that anybody can be part of.
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:49.361]  It's just dumb.
[03:02:49.401 --> 03:02:50.782]  Like, you eat who has good food.
[03:02:50.802 --> 03:02:51.623]  I don't care what color they are.
[03:02:51.903 --> 03:02:52.603]  You listen to music.
[03:02:52.803 --> 03:02:53.664]  Don't care what color they are.
[03:02:54.044 --> 03:02:54.865]  You date people.
[03:02:54.885 --> 03:02:58.267]  It matters how they are and how they look, not what color they are.
[03:02:58.808 --> 03:03:03.111]  And it's just this whole thing is just stupid and is used to control us.
[03:03:03.671 --> 03:03:11.096]  And now the way they threw Kanye West in a mental institution last year for supporting Trump for almost two weeks, it just shows that's like Russia used to be.
[03:03:12.394 --> 03:03:12.995]  60 years ago.
[03:03:13.415 --> 03:03:14.776]  That's not how we're supposed to be.
[03:03:14.836 --> 03:03:16.617]  So, I admire Kanye West.
[03:03:16.657 --> 03:03:24.323]  I'll be honest, I don't cover pop stuff, so I didn't like Kanye because of all the Kardashians and all that, but now that I've actually looked into it in the last two years, he's got a lot of courage.
[03:03:25.043 --> 03:03:26.704]  And so, I mean, I'm glad he's out there.
[03:03:27.825 --> 03:03:28.045]  Right.
[03:03:28.706 --> 03:03:36.531]  I didn't realize, I didn't realize until they started to persecute him how he was important and why the Trump movement was for me.
[03:03:36.871 --> 03:03:38.893]  Like, I was already on the Trump train, but it only
[03:03:41.462 --> 03:03:41.984]  Didn't hang up?
[03:03:43.128 --> 03:03:44.331]  Sorry Marcus, your phone cut out.
[03:03:44.352 --> 03:03:44.693]  Say that again?
[03:03:45.768 --> 03:03:49.290]  I said everything that they've done with Kanye, if anything, woke me up more.
[03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:57.693]  And it made me sit there and say, well, yeah, I kind of thought Kanye was stupid running on stage and, you know, getting in front of Taylor Swift and, you know, why is he married to the Kardashians?
[03:03:57.733 --> 03:04:00.314]  But then I see him, I see him later.
[03:04:00.394 --> 03:04:02.975]  I learned no, because the MTV fakes the awards.
[03:04:03.356 --> 03:04:04.056]  It isn't real.
[03:04:04.356 --> 03:04:05.737]  And they just give it to whoever they want.
[03:04:05.877 --> 03:04:10.879]  Like I talked to I can't talk about it, but a lot of these reality TV shows and exercise shows and.
[03:04:12.022 --> 03:04:12.342]  I don't know.
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:34.602]  Yeah, I mean, I've been to Hollywood.
[03:04:34.722 --> 03:04:35.462]  I'm a musician.
[03:04:35.482 --> 03:04:41.227]  I went to Hollywood, and I was in the top, you know what I mean, music label that was gonna do things.
[03:04:41.267 --> 03:04:45.210]  And they sat me down in a room, and they said, look, man, you need to act more black.
[03:04:45.711 --> 03:04:47.412]  And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:04:47.772 --> 03:04:49.534]  I've been woken up to Hollywood.
[03:04:49.734 --> 03:04:54.758]  Tom Arnold, we need, I mean, he, somebody needs to smack him in the back of the head.
[03:04:54.858 --> 03:04:55.638]  Marco, stay there.
[03:04:55.678 --> 03:05:01.203]  Back in 60 seconds, I want to finish up with you and the hand of the baton, the Lionel, but I want to hear about what they sat you down in a room and told you.
[03:05:03.101 --> 03:05:03.251]  I think.
[03:05:08.223 --> 03:05:11.305]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:11.345 --> 03:05:11.865]  You're on the air.
[03:05:11.885 --> 03:05:13.046]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:13.066 --> 03:05:13.906]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:14.106 --> 03:05:14.707]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:15.027 --> 03:05:15.387]  Good, man.
[03:05:15.427 --> 03:05:16.508]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:16.568 --> 03:05:21.370]  Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:27.934]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:27.954 --> 03:05:29.795]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:05:29.875 --> 03:05:36.038]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:37.179 --> 03:05:38.300]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:40.803]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:05:40.843 --> 03:05:42.364]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:42.765 --> 03:05:44.386]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:44.807 --> 03:05:45.547]  And exactly.
[03:05:45.567 --> 03:05:49.812]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:50.172 --> 03:05:50.432]  Boom!
[03:05:50.572 --> 03:05:53.415]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:53.475 --> 03:05:54.016]  It's amazing.
[03:05:54.056 --> 03:05:55.357]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:05:55.417 --> 03:05:58.300]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:04.858 --> 03:06:05.559]  He's not a tough guy.
[03:06:05.599 --> 03:06:07.000]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:07.860]  He's a punk.
[03:06:08.881 --> 03:06:09.622]  He's a dog.
[03:06:09.902 --> 03:06:11.143]  He's a pig.
[03:06:11.423 --> 03:06:12.884]  And he can suck my f***.
[03:06:13.084 --> 03:06:15.526]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[03:06:15.726 --> 03:06:19.770]  I'll meet him in a hotel room any motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:21.191]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[03:06:21.531 --> 03:06:25.754]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, c*** sucker.
[03:06:34.707 --> 03:06:42.840]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun at the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard, art teacher Pale Modi has now been seen by countless viewers across the internet.
[03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:43.341]  Yes!
[03:06:44.423 --> 03:06:49.050]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[03:06:51.276 --> 03:06:57.501]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[03:06:57.721 --> 03:07:06.527]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[03:07:06.587 --> 03:07:12.652]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[03:07:12.792 --> 03:07:17.976]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[03:07:31.641 --> 03:07:36.585]  If you are resuming this transition, you are the Resistance soldier.
[03:07:38.627 --> 03:07:42.249]  All right, Lionel, former prosecutor, Seneca TV and radio host, has taken over.
[03:07:42.269 --> 03:07:43.951]  I always love having him host the show.
[03:07:44.451 --> 03:07:45.412]  We're taking some amazing calls.
[03:07:45.432 --> 03:07:49.195]  He's going to continue with calls on the grab bag of issues that are all over the map.
[03:07:49.215 --> 03:07:54.299]  I'm going to finish with this caller right now, but I wanted to bring this up to him because he's a lawyer.
[03:07:56.115 --> 03:07:56.936]  We couldn't believe it.
[03:07:56.956 --> 03:08:11.367]  I want to ask you what you think is going on because I've got a lot of law firms involved in this, some of the top ones in the country, and they've never seen lawsuits this fake filed to obviously get the PR and to say horrible things in the suit that you can't get away with in public.
[03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:17.052]  And so Georgetown contacted the court and my law firm in D.C.
[03:08:18.032 --> 03:08:20.715]  and Mark Balin today and said, we're withdrawing our lawsuit tomorrow.
[03:08:21.155 --> 03:08:22.016]  But we're not stupid.
[03:08:22.036 --> 03:08:23.477]  We know they're going to probably refile one.
[03:08:25.214 --> 03:08:28.538]  Because we had that press conference a week and a half ago in D.C.
[03:08:28.578 --> 03:08:31.060]  and pointed out just all the insanity.
[03:08:32.662 --> 03:08:44.074]  I mean, not just typos, but they just say for 70 pages things we never said, which automatically you get a slap back now that Virginia passed last year.
[03:08:45.498 --> 03:08:51.185]  So we're predicting they're withdrawing it, there'll be no media coverage, and they'll pull out all the defamation and refile it.
[03:08:51.226 --> 03:08:56.032]  But now the media outlets that ran with that, unless they run retractions, we've got to reach out to them.
[03:08:56.352 --> 03:08:57.594]  We've got to notify all this media.
[03:08:57.614 --> 03:09:01.539]  And they have 30 days, depending on the state, they have to retract.
[03:09:01.579 --> 03:09:03.401]  But that's an army of our folks at the contact.
[03:09:04.362 --> 03:09:09.907]  You know, hundreds of publications and CNN, you name it, and say, hey, this has been retracted.
[03:09:09.927 --> 03:09:10.648]  This isn't true.
[03:09:10.668 --> 03:09:12.810]  And they just expect we won't.
[03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:13.851]  I think they're going to refile it.
[03:09:13.871 --> 03:09:18.595]  You're, you know, you were a successful prosecutor down in Miami and you've done your own deal.
[03:09:18.615 --> 03:09:20.056]  You know, national talk show host.
[03:09:20.116 --> 03:09:20.757]  You're a smart guy.
[03:09:20.777 --> 03:09:22.879]  Let me ask you before we finish with some calls, you take over.
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:34.045]  Why do you think they didn't report on us filing countersuit against them a week and a half ago, and now they're withdrawing the Georgetown-Charlottesville fake lawsuit where they claim I said some cameraman killed a woman?
[03:09:34.285 --> 03:09:34.945]  Never said that.
[03:09:35.145 --> 03:09:36.126]  That's what I mean.
[03:09:36.166 --> 03:09:39.908]  My lawyers go, this is like what you'd file to lose a slapback suit.
[03:09:39.948 --> 03:09:41.128]  It's like textbook.
[03:09:41.408 --> 03:09:42.089]  What do you think's happening?
[03:09:42.109 --> 03:09:42.969]  Just arrogance?
[03:09:43.029 --> 03:09:46.671]  Or they think I'm riding around on horses down here and I'm like, what's that?
[03:09:46.731 --> 03:09:47.912]  I never heard of electricity.
[03:09:49.273 --> 03:09:51.255]  All these lawsuits are incredibly fake.
[03:09:51.475 --> 03:09:53.197]  We've got to fight them, we've got to counter-sue.
[03:09:53.577 --> 03:09:59.283]  But this thing, if you put a quarter in the machine, you sue us, you get this big merry-go-round in the media of lies.
[03:09:59.604 --> 03:10:00.465]  They've got to pay the piper.
[03:10:00.485 --> 03:10:01.546]  I think they're starting to figure that out.
[03:10:01.586 --> 03:10:01.986]  What do you think?
[03:10:03.067 --> 03:10:03.828]  Well, I couldn't tell you.
[03:10:04.088 --> 03:10:06.030]  I mean, I'm not trying to be coy.
[03:10:06.311 --> 03:10:06.991]  I couldn't tell you.
[03:10:07.011 --> 03:10:07.972]  I'm not even sure about this.
[03:10:07.993 --> 03:10:09.234]  But I've got to tell you one thing, Alex.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:16.906]  It's never ceased to amaze me how these lawsuits don't even look like lawsuits.
[03:10:16.946 --> 03:10:21.790]  Take the one last week that the DNC filed against Russia.
[03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:23.572]  I love this one, Russia.
[03:10:23.912 --> 03:10:25.213]  Where do you serve, Russia?
[03:10:25.254 --> 03:10:33.901]  Anyway, but the actual cause of action, the complaint, is a narrative of almost like a novel.
[03:10:34.462 --> 03:10:36.404]  That's what I said, it's like a screenplay!
[03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:40.633]  So now you publish your screenplays in court.
[03:10:41.173 --> 03:10:42.294]  That's how you publish now.
[03:10:43.596 --> 03:10:48.741]  Well, normally, you know, these complaints are very, very sterile, and they're very precise, they're very surgical.
[03:10:49.141 --> 03:10:54.466]  You can say, well, admit or deny, admit or deny, deny, you know, and they're very, very good with citation.
[03:10:54.907 --> 03:11:00.132]  The best one, if you can get a hold of this one, remember Alex, it was a Friday afternoon,
[03:11:00.992 --> 03:11:08.055]  And the government filed against 13 imaginary, mysterious, I think actual Russian bots.
[03:11:08.375 --> 03:11:14.457]  It was a Friday, right at the time that the FBI was coming under tremendous attack for why they didn't follow up.
[03:11:14.477 --> 03:11:16.798]  Sure, we know it's all PR, that's what I'm saying.
[03:11:16.918 --> 03:11:21.479]  So, it is filed as like publishing a novel.
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:23.780]  This is how you publish digital novels now.
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:27.141]  You sue someone, you defame them, you call it a defamation suit.
[03:11:27.481 --> 03:11:28.662]  So how do we respond to this?
[03:11:29.790 --> 03:11:31.192]  Well, but I don't know.
[03:11:31.332 --> 03:11:36.838]  And also the idea of complaints are they are to apprise you, you know, notice pleading to put you on notice.
[03:11:37.078 --> 03:11:37.999]  This is what was said.
[03:11:38.019 --> 03:11:39.661]  This is why it violates.
[03:11:39.701 --> 03:11:42.124]  This is this is how you frame your response.
[03:11:42.164 --> 03:11:42.725]  This is whatever.
[03:11:43.345 --> 03:11:45.188]  And we're getting more and more of these.
[03:11:45.208 --> 03:11:48.071]  And I'm sorry, I have not read the particular.
[03:11:48.752 --> 03:11:57.177]  Specifics of your case, but in the two that I've mentioned, I've read this and I've asked colleagues of mine, I'm saying, have you seen anything like this?
[03:11:57.497 --> 03:12:13.467]  You know, what's interesting about this- That's what I'm saying, so I'm asking you, what is the lawyer from a prosecutor, that's what my lawyers tell me, they go, this is new, this is like a novel, a screenplay of made up crap, they publish it because it's protected from defamation because it's court, the media is not protected, I don't think they know, regurgitating it's not,
[03:12:14.338 --> 03:12:21.463]  And then embellishing it so it's a new level of like leftist insanity or trying to create an alternate dimension?
[03:12:21.483 --> 03:12:22.084]  I mean, what is it?
[03:12:23.944 --> 03:12:28.267]  Again, I'm trying, I don't know what motivates these people, but I do know this.
[03:12:28.747 --> 03:12:35.432]  There are strict rules of professional consideration and professional responsibility and rules of ethics that are actionable.
[03:12:35.732 --> 03:12:43.417]  Anytime a lawyer signs off on something, you're saying you have good faith in this and this is actionable, this is based on law, this is based on your good faith belief.
[03:12:43.437 --> 03:12:46.759]  There are officers of the court standing up saying this is bona fide.
[03:12:47.691 --> 03:12:48.272]  Absolutely.
[03:12:48.512 --> 03:12:56.642]  And it's also we have really seen now new ways of using the notion of libel from what it used to be.
[03:12:56.823 --> 03:13:00.968]  You know, one of the things that's the most that that is completely missed is simply this.
[03:13:01.449 --> 03:13:05.634]  You know, Alex, in the old days, somebody would say, for example, here's the prototypical case.
[03:13:06.323 --> 03:13:09.065]  You said something that was a lie.
[03:13:09.365 --> 03:13:10.606]  I'm a business owner.
[03:13:10.706 --> 03:13:14.488]  You made a statement of fact, not an opinion, nothing that was protected.
[03:13:14.889 --> 03:13:18.671]  And based upon this erroneous statement of fact, I lost my business.
[03:13:18.751 --> 03:13:19.852]  I lost my customers.
[03:13:19.892 --> 03:13:20.292]  Nobody cared.
[03:13:20.692 --> 03:13:23.354]  I suffered economic damage, as I can show you.
[03:13:23.454 --> 03:13:25.556]  I suffered from what you said.
[03:13:25.616 --> 03:13:27.917]  You said this, and it's not true.
[03:13:29.498 --> 03:13:32.199]  Prototypical, classic, quintessential libel.
[03:13:32.259 --> 03:13:36.141]  You've made a statement of fact that turned out not to be true.
[03:13:36.481 --> 03:13:47.045]  Today, it's kind of morphed into hurt my feelings or said something which in the court of public opinion may be shocking, but not is necessarily actionable.
[03:13:47.425 --> 03:13:53.007]  The best one, I think, is how sometimes people claim they were even damaged.
[03:13:53.547 --> 03:13:56.588]  You know, you can't rob somebody when they're asleep.
[03:13:56.968 --> 03:13:59.569]  You have to be awake to show fear.
[03:13:59.829 --> 03:14:01.510]  There's certain things you have to know about.
[03:14:01.530 --> 03:14:06.612]  So if somebody says, hey, by the way, did you hear what this guy said about you in Wyoming?
[03:14:07.132 --> 03:14:07.432]  No.
[03:14:08.012 --> 03:14:09.112]  How do you prove damages?
[03:14:09.212 --> 03:14:17.875]  I was about to say, they bring up these made-up cases that no one ever heard of to say I'm doing bad things to people, and they're the ones publishing the BS that I didn't say.
[03:14:17.895 --> 03:14:19.996]  They say you defame somebody.
[03:14:20.316 --> 03:14:21.937]  They put out the lie I didn't say.
[03:14:22.737 --> 03:14:25.839]  And then say, I'm liable because the mainstream media just put the lie out.
[03:14:25.879 --> 03:14:28.361]  This is like next level insanity.
[03:14:29.361 --> 03:14:30.362]  You know what the saying is?
[03:14:30.662 --> 03:14:32.604]  Those that gods would destroy, they first make man.
[03:14:33.084 --> 03:14:36.406]  I think this is the beginning of the end of the legal profession, as we've known.
[03:14:36.486 --> 03:14:38.648]  I mean, I believe they're committing political suicide.
[03:14:39.748 --> 03:14:43.591]  And even though, aside from the fact that this is, and I think people
[03:14:44.585 --> 03:14:48.931]  Sometimes mistake the anger, the frustration, the money.
[03:14:49.051 --> 03:14:56.540]  I'm sure you could be using a lot of your resources in far smarter ways than hiring lawyers, whatever the arrangement is.
[03:14:57.201 --> 03:14:58.683]  But here is the irony, though.
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:04.583]  I don't want to bring up Nietzsche, but what does not destroy you makes you stronger.
[03:15:04.744 --> 03:15:14.191]  You are basically providing a platform, and in a strange, almost a backwards way, validating the veracity of what you're saying by giving you the platform.
[03:15:14.211 --> 03:15:20.496]  Because if you said something which was totally insane, assuming you said it, but that was absolutely baseless, who would bother?
[03:15:20.996 --> 03:15:23.078]  It's like, you only take flak when you're over the target.
[03:15:23.179 --> 03:15:28.504]  In a strange way, in a reverse way of psychologizing, if you will, if that's a word, you're actually validating your statement.
[03:15:28.524 --> 03:15:30.747]  No, he was saying, they're not thinking past one step.
[03:15:31.327 --> 03:15:31.968]  They don't get that.
[03:15:31.988 --> 03:15:33.109]  They have to fight these cases.
[03:15:33.189 --> 03:15:34.631]  Why are they elevating us?
[03:15:34.991 --> 03:15:35.852]  All this, exactly.
[03:15:35.872 --> 03:15:36.593]  You're going to take over.
[03:15:36.653 --> 03:15:37.454]  Great caller, Marcos.
[03:15:37.474 --> 03:15:37.994]  That's more to save you.
[03:15:38.014 --> 03:15:38.335]  Go to him.
[03:15:38.675 --> 03:15:40.256]  I'm going to let you take over all these great callers.
[03:15:40.296 --> 03:15:43.459]  Daryl, John, Carlos, Pastor Sam, awesome gathering.
[03:15:44.099 --> 03:15:47.061]  It's the great Lionel of Lionel Media with you right now.
[03:15:47.482 --> 03:15:50.664]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:15:50.684 --> 03:15:53.807]  Follow Lionel at Twitter at LionelMedia and LionelMedia.com.
[03:15:54.147 --> 03:15:57.289]  We'll be right back on the other side in the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:15:57.589 --> 03:15:58.090]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.836 --> 03:16:09.464]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[03:16:10.145 --> 03:16:11.927]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[03:16:12.527 --> 03:16:18.394]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[03:16:18.795 --> 03:16:21.438]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:21.698 --> 03:16:24.740]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:25.101 --> 03:16:31.025]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:31.665 --> 03:16:38.130]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:38.490 --> 03:16:44.395]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:44.856 --> 03:16:48.479]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:16:48.959 --> 03:16:57.166]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[03:16:57.566 --> 03:17:03.812]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:04.864 --> 03:17:09.265]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[03:17:09.905 --> 03:17:17.986]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[03:17:18.566 --> 03:17:20.227]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[03:17:20.767 --> 03:17:27.708]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:27.748 --> 03:17:30.768]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:32.229]  It's not absorbable.
[03:17:32.629 --> 03:17:33.189]  It's toxic.
[03:17:33.889 --> 03:17:45.998]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[03:17:46.119 --> 03:17:48.641]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[03:17:49.381 --> 03:17:56.828]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[03:17:56.848 --> 03:17:57.749]  They used to make drugs.
[03:17:57.769 --> 03:18:01.932]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[03:18:02.333 --> 03:18:07.057]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[03:18:07.638 --> 03:18:11.201]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[03:18:11.481 --> 03:18:15.365]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[03:18:15.925 --> 03:18:18.666]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[03:18:18.706 --> 03:18:19.846]  We have a good supply right now.
[03:18:20.266 --> 03:18:21.606]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[03:18:22.046 --> 03:18:24.347]  But this may be the clincher.
[03:18:24.387 --> 03:18:27.607]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[03:18:28.027 --> 03:18:31.428]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[03:18:31.888 --> 03:18:34.009]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[03:18:34.349 --> 03:18:35.729]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[03:18:36.069 --> 03:18:43.451]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[03:18:43.751 --> 03:18:44.611]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:18:45.231 --> 03:18:45.371]  Yeah.
[03:19:00.179 --> 03:19:00.740]  Pure iodine.
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:01.841]  Pure iodine.
[03:19:01.942 --> 03:19:06.088]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[03:19:06.388 --> 03:19:08.531]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[03:19:08.892 --> 03:19:10.134]  It's available exclusively.
[03:19:10.414 --> 03:19:14.360]  Survival Shield X2 at m4warslife.com and m4warsstore.com.
[03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:15.722]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[03:19:16.795 --> 03:19:17.976]  That we can work this out.
[03:19:36.113 --> 03:19:38.894]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[03:19:39.234 --> 03:19:47.557]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[03:19:48.117 --> 03:19:52.439]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[03:19:52.859 --> 03:19:59.441]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:20:05.586 --> 03:20:08.179]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.423 --> 03:20:35.024]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:35.504 --> 03:20:37.344]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:38.384 --> 03:20:42.525]  Alrighty, Lionel, with you sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:42.565 --> 03:20:43.225]  So glad to be here.
[03:20:43.245 --> 03:20:44.045]  I want to get down to business.
[03:20:44.065 --> 03:20:45.145]  I've got so much to talk about.
[03:20:46.086 --> 03:20:50.906]  I've been thinking, which is a dangerous thing, and one of the worst parts about this is what I want to talk about!
[03:20:51.407 --> 03:20:54.007]  There's 25 million things.
[03:20:54.187 --> 03:20:59.248]  So in no particular order, in no particular sense of what's important and what's not, let me tell you what's really getting me
[03:21:00.555 --> 03:21:01.195]  Charged up.
[03:21:01.696 --> 03:21:03.797]  Do you know what last night opened?
[03:21:03.817 --> 03:21:04.597]  Let me try this in English.
[03:21:04.617 --> 03:21:06.118]  Do you know what opened last night?
[03:21:06.138 --> 03:21:07.158]  There we go on Broadway.
[03:21:07.178 --> 03:21:13.481]  Do you know what it was that absolutely has taken Broadway by storm?
[03:21:14.022 --> 03:21:15.042]  Do you have any idea?
[03:21:15.162 --> 03:21:16.103]  Harry Potter.
[03:21:16.583 --> 03:21:17.723]  Harry Potter.
[03:21:17.783 --> 03:21:19.644]  Now, I will tell you this much.
[03:21:19.964 --> 03:21:22.686]  I'm not familiar.
[03:21:22.706 --> 03:21:23.986]  A lot of Harry Potter.
[03:21:24.006 --> 03:21:24.527]  I know who he is.
[03:21:24.547 --> 03:21:25.187]  I know what it is.
[03:21:25.967 --> 03:21:26.668]  The story that is.
[03:21:27.428 --> 03:21:29.189]  But what is it about?
[03:21:29.764 --> 03:21:32.346]  And I gotta give you a lot of provisos here.
[03:21:32.627 --> 03:21:33.848]  I don't believe in black magic.
[03:21:34.108 --> 03:21:35.269]  I don't believe in any of this stuff.
[03:21:35.589 --> 03:21:40.493]  I'm sorry, just point of complete disclosure, I'm irreligious.
[03:21:41.394 --> 03:21:43.216]  I don't speak God and I don't speak French.
[03:21:43.718 --> 03:21:52.989]  I'm not saying that French people don't exist just because I don't understand what they're saying, and I'm not saying there's no religion because I don't understand it, but I'm not into any of that stuff, no matter what.
[03:21:53.049 --> 03:21:55.212]  So I don't react in horror from that point of view.
[03:21:55.652 --> 03:21:59.516]  But isn't it funny that right now,
[03:22:00.377 --> 03:22:18.688]  As this world, this society of ours, is being so contaminated by the rank, the fetid, the feculate, the rancid world of sex trafficking, sex abuse, human trafficking, cults and the like.
[03:22:19.548 --> 03:22:31.745]  By virtue of people who believe in symbology and letting you know everything that they do with hand signals and Instagrams, what is going on here?
[03:22:32.481 --> 03:22:34.302]  Do you think that's interesting?
[03:22:34.642 --> 03:22:35.342]  I think it is.
[03:22:35.582 --> 03:22:36.543]  I just want to give you that.
[03:22:36.963 --> 03:22:37.763]  Park it over there.
[03:22:38.003 --> 03:22:38.863]  Just make you say, hmm.
[03:22:40.184 --> 03:22:42.825]  For no particular reason, they say, that's odd.
[03:22:43.165 --> 03:22:44.486]  Now, I think it's terrific.
[03:22:44.686 --> 03:22:45.846]  People can see whatever they want.
[03:22:46.166 --> 03:22:47.067]  I don't care about it.
[03:22:47.387 --> 03:22:54.689]  But just think, wizards, warlocks, magic spells, the occult, whatever.
[03:22:55.090 --> 03:22:55.830]  Does that scare you?
[03:22:55.850 --> 03:22:56.810]  Does that frighten you?
[03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:58.511]  Maybe, maybe not.
[03:22:58.911 --> 03:23:00.652]  But isn't that interesting?
[03:23:00.692 --> 03:23:01.472]  Because you know,
[03:23:02.535 --> 03:23:16.062]  The more that I think we as humans elevate beyond that, the more I say, I see, that we've never really evolved, that we've been like this since we first crawled out of the ooze.
[03:23:17.546 --> 03:23:22.787]  And we have looked at symbology and we have looked at ways to change our environment.
[03:23:23.147 --> 03:23:24.187]  Locus of control.
[03:23:24.467 --> 03:23:32.249]  We've tried potions and talismans and we've tried everything from rain dancing to, and we do it right now, with weather manipulation.
[03:23:32.709 --> 03:23:36.810]  We're trying through either extracurricular, through religion, through what have you.
[03:23:37.290 --> 03:23:44.251]  But isn't that funny that people are going to be applauding and lauding and heralding what is basically
[03:23:45.186 --> 03:23:47.127]  The occult, one could say.
[03:23:47.827 --> 03:23:48.988]  Think about that one.
[03:23:49.288 --> 03:23:50.328]  Let that sink in.
[03:23:50.589 --> 03:23:51.949]  Next, I've got to tell you this much.
[03:23:52.729 --> 03:23:55.571]  This amazes me, because you've got to look at things the way I do.
[03:23:55.651 --> 03:23:57.712]  I look at it, I'm thinking, OK, this is interesting.
[03:23:57.732 --> 03:24:00.333]  California is most probably going to pass a bill.
[03:24:00.373 --> 03:24:09.257]  Governor Moonbeam is going to pass a bill against conversion therapy because they believe that conversion therapy is a fraud.
[03:24:10.057 --> 03:24:20.080]  They believe that the idea of taking somebody who is gay and changing them or converting them is a fraud.
[03:24:20.340 --> 03:24:23.061]  That it's wrong and it harms people.
[03:24:23.121 --> 03:24:23.721]  And you know what?
[03:24:24.181 --> 03:24:26.822]  I would probably say you're absolutely right.
[03:24:27.442 --> 03:24:31.624]  I think that is specious, being able to convert somebody, right?
[03:24:31.864 --> 03:24:51.854]  Where in the heck would somebody get that crazy idea that you could, what, just decide one day, yeah, I'll go to the doctor and he'll convert me, as though sexual behavior is malleable and prude-ian, that you can decide that it's fluid, that one can have gender as... Wait a minute.
[03:24:53.055 --> 03:24:54.135]  Isn't that what we're told?
[03:24:54.395 --> 03:24:54.776]  Hold it!
[03:24:55.216 --> 03:24:55.696]  Wait a minute!
[03:24:56.468 --> 03:25:03.634]  If we are born, I guess, or if we can select, are we born bisexual?
[03:25:03.734 --> 03:25:07.858]  Are we born gender nebulous?
[03:25:09.219 --> 03:25:10.680]  Sexual orientation-less?
[03:25:11.061 --> 03:25:11.902]  What does this mean?
[03:25:12.242 --> 03:25:21.430]  How can someone say, this conversion therapy does wrong, and I probably agree with you, it could just ruin somebody.
[03:25:21.986 --> 03:25:28.091]  By making them be straight when they're gay, or I guess somebody could go in and have the opposite.
[03:25:28.731 --> 03:25:34.875]  I wonder, I wonder if California would mind if somebody said, no, I want to be gay.
[03:25:35.096 --> 03:25:36.477]  They might say, no, wait a minute.
[03:25:37.497 --> 03:25:40.680]  That's not the same, whatever.
[03:25:40.740 --> 03:25:44.963]  But do you see the following problems with this?
[03:25:45.463 --> 03:25:46.304]  Number one,
[03:25:47.532 --> 03:25:49.732]  We're told that there is no such thing as gender.
[03:25:49.752 --> 03:25:51.873]  We're told that there's no such thing as sexual orientation.
[03:25:52.233 --> 03:25:58.994]  And also, what do you mean that a type of psychological treatment is a fraud?
[03:25:59.594 --> 03:26:02.375]  What do you mean there's no basis for it?
[03:26:02.735 --> 03:26:08.676]  You've been telling kids they have ADD and ADHD, which they may or may not have, and other people have said, I don't think so.
[03:26:09.076 --> 03:26:16.777]  You have absolutely narcotized generations based upon things in the DSM and the DSM-5 that you've made up on the spot.
[03:26:17.856 --> 03:26:20.199]  Now, why can't I call that a fraud?
[03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:31.896]  And furthermore, if there is somebody whose faith is such that they believe that you can, through prayer or divination or whatever the heck you want,
[03:26:33.109 --> 03:26:41.776]  That you can change sexual orientation through prayer and the like, which might fall under the rubric of this conversion therapy?
[03:26:41.816 --> 03:26:42.476]  Then why?
[03:26:42.977 --> 03:26:45.759]  Pray tell, why is that wrong?
[03:26:45.919 --> 03:26:48.881]  Isn't that their First Amendment right to believe in this?
[03:26:49.181 --> 03:26:56.487]  This is one of the most dangerous laws that people are applauding, but they haven't thought about it.
[03:26:57.122 --> 03:26:58.783]  They can give your kids vaccines.
[03:26:59.064 --> 03:27:06.649]  They can give your kids psychotropic medication to change their ability to think and process through ADHD.
[03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:12.994]  They can do... So, because somebody has said this is a fraud, are they going to do astrology next?
[03:27:13.174 --> 03:27:13.855]  No!
[03:27:14.155 --> 03:27:14.775]  Wait a minute!
[03:27:15.296 --> 03:27:21.881]  Here in New York, on every corner, there's either a bank, a nail salon, or an astrologer.
[03:27:21.921 --> 03:27:23.802]  There's astrology all over the place.
[03:27:23.842 --> 03:27:25.003]  Get your palm ready.
[03:27:25.063 --> 03:27:25.824]  Tarot cards.
[03:27:26.667 --> 03:27:30.231]  Are we going to pass a law that says that's fraudulent?
[03:27:30.451 --> 03:27:31.212]  Of course not.
[03:27:31.532 --> 03:27:32.593]  I'm not saying it is.
[03:27:33.033 --> 03:27:34.315]  I don't particularly believe in it.
[03:27:34.615 --> 03:27:38.239]  I'm not much of a believer, despite what the monkeys may have intoned.
[03:27:38.559 --> 03:27:41.422]  But is that not for me to decide?
[03:27:41.442 --> 03:27:48.469]  How is it that in this particular case, the government of California decides we are going to impart our wisdom
[03:27:49.634 --> 03:28:14.169]  On a particular modality, on a particular type of therapy, on a particular way of thinking, regarding a particular situation, that they believe, these conversion folks, that they can change behavior, when by the same token, every other story tells you, not only can you change on your own, that gender and sexual orientation is fluid, but that you were born with the blank slate, the tabula rasa.
[03:28:15.482 --> 03:28:17.223]  Look at laws carefully.
[03:28:17.684 --> 03:28:22.487]  Look at the news carefully and peel back the layers of the onion and look and see for yourself.
[03:28:22.567 --> 03:28:24.368]  Does this make any sense to you?
[03:28:24.728 --> 03:28:26.169]  You can't have it both ways.
[03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:28.991]  Now, I want to talk about some other aspects of it.
[03:28:29.031 --> 03:28:29.712]  I want to talk about
[03:28:30.587 --> 03:28:34.649]  Lawsuits, this DNC insanity against Russia.
[03:28:34.970 --> 03:28:42.674]  We're going to be talking also about no gas in Syria and how apparently a lot of people in this administration have looked the other way.
[03:28:42.994 --> 03:28:46.376]  Our number for those of you so inclined is 877-789-2539.
[03:28:46.696 --> 03:28:50.958]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:28:51.419 --> 03:28:52.279]  We have more coming up.
[03:28:52.519 --> 03:28:53.180]  Lionel with you.
[03:28:53.300 --> 03:28:54.220]  Glad to be here.
[03:28:54.520 --> 03:28:55.501]  I want to hear from you.
[03:28:56.341 --> 03:28:57.342]  Truly, stay tuned.
[03:29:02.832 --> 03:29:04.193]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:04.493 --> 03:29:05.794]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.974 --> 03:29:06.875]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:07.155 --> 03:29:12.940]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:18.885]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:19.065 --> 03:29:35.912]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:36.332 --> 03:29:38.454]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:38.814 --> 03:29:39.995]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:40.275 --> 03:29:41.036]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:41.316 --> 03:29:41.936]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:42.236 --> 03:29:44.058]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:29:56.807 --> 03:29:59.369]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:30:13.803 --> 03:30:22.869]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him, and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[03:30:23.370 --> 03:30:32.256]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[03:30:32.816 --> 03:30:37.718]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[03:30:38.218 --> 03:30:54.565]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[03:30:55.145 --> 03:30:59.187]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[03:30:59.887 --> 03:31:00.107]  No.
[03:31:00.647 --> 03:31:06.269]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[03:31:07.209 --> 03:31:13.311]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[03:31:13.351 --> 03:31:16.032]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[03:31:17.228 --> 03:31:21.051]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[03:31:21.091 --> 03:31:24.073]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[03:31:24.093 --> 03:31:25.274]  I always call her Losh.
[03:31:26.095 --> 03:31:27.015]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[03:31:27.195 --> 03:31:27.776]  Dana Lash.
[03:31:27.796 --> 03:31:29.737]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[03:31:30.638 --> 03:31:31.098]  Great lady.
[03:31:31.639 --> 03:31:38.143]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA that the left wants to basically kill and says is a witch and burn her, literally.
[03:31:39.764 --> 03:31:43.747]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[03:31:44.468 --> 03:31:45.589]  George Soros' outfit.
[03:31:46.687 --> 03:31:51.110]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association is spending money with Alex Jones.
[03:31:51.210 --> 03:31:56.813]  Like, they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[03:31:57.454 --> 03:31:58.434]  No, morons.
[03:31:59.195 --> 03:32:00.195]  I like that ad.
[03:32:01.256 --> 03:32:05.298]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[03:32:05.619 --> 03:32:07.940]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[03:32:07.980 --> 03:32:09.181]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[03:32:10.021 --> 03:32:10.882]  Comprende?
[03:32:14.933 --> 03:32:16.813]  I pay to air the NRA.
[03:32:17.914 --> 03:32:18.514]  Figure that out?
[03:32:19.374 --> 03:32:20.834]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[03:32:21.574 --> 03:32:22.915]  I'm not doing this for money.
[03:32:23.575 --> 03:32:25.115]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[03:32:25.775 --> 03:32:29.096]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[03:32:29.456 --> 03:32:31.437]  It's about my children and the future.
[03:32:32.117 --> 03:32:33.037]  I'm a kamikaze.
[03:32:33.997 --> 03:32:35.857]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[03:32:36.158 --> 03:32:37.498]  I don't care how you come after me.
[03:32:37.678 --> 03:32:38.578]  I'm committed.
[03:32:39.118 --> 03:32:42.959]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[03:32:45.788 --> 03:32:49.130]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[03:32:52.932 --> 03:32:58.875]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:06.559 --> 03:33:09.161]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.316 --> 03:33:26.498]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:33:27.238 --> 03:33:28.678]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.480 --> 03:33:34.521]  Howdy, Alina, with you.
[03:33:34.961 --> 03:33:36.001]  Jerry Rafferty there.
[03:33:36.021 --> 03:33:36.861]  Remember that one?
[03:33:36.881 --> 03:33:38.642]  It's at Baker Street.
[03:33:39.022 --> 03:33:40.203]  That's during my time.
[03:33:40.223 --> 03:33:44.544]  I think I'll be here for two more minutes until the top of the hour.
[03:33:44.564 --> 03:33:46.205]  I want to do one more thing, then I'll take your calls.
[03:33:46.986 --> 03:33:54.354]  Um, I mentioned this, uh, this Harry Potter story, which I just find so interesting because I'm thinking to myself, this is the occult.
[03:33:54.474 --> 03:33:55.875]  Well, no, it's not the occult.
[03:33:55.895 --> 03:34:01.501]  In case you just tuned in, last night, Harry Potter opened on Broadway and they're going nuts with it!
[03:34:01.521 --> 03:34:08.287]  This is the biggest thing, the biggest, craziest, biggest, because most Broadway shows are a bomb!
[03:34:08.387 --> 03:34:10.670]  Nobody makes any money, they fall, they're
[03:34:11.371 --> 03:34:14.352]  But this is going to be, this is going to go on for 10 years.
[03:34:14.472 --> 03:34:15.652]  This is big!
[03:34:15.672 --> 03:34:17.533]  Now I'm thinking, does anybody know what this is?
[03:34:17.573 --> 03:34:34.938]  Now, recently, I don't know if you have been, if you're like me, I know that you're, Alex has followed the great Zack, and I'm a QAnon addict, and I don't know why, I'm just losing my mind, I'm getting these coded messages, they just dropped, we got new news here!
[03:34:35.299 --> 03:34:39.760]  I'm like, I'm looking at this, and I'm being deluged with this notion of evil.
[03:34:40.387 --> 03:34:48.581]  And what's interesting as well is that we've been having here in New York more talks about sex rings, sex slaves, human trafficking, left and right!
[03:34:49.062 --> 03:34:50.625]  And I'm thinking to myself, do you know why this is?
[03:34:51.212 --> 03:35:04.041]  They're habituating you to the idea of this, so that when this breaks, especially when somebody big breaks, when somebody is involved in this, because you've been getting little breadcrumbs, as they say, little hints here and there.
[03:35:04.621 --> 03:35:20.932]  You've mentioned Epstein and the island and the Lidl Express, and this one's traveling on the plane, and this one, and then we have this actress, Alison Mack, and she's arrested, and pretty soon you're becoming more and more acclimated, habituated, where stimuli that are not novel
[03:35:21.812 --> 03:35:27.994]  You get used to it, like when you put on a watch for the first time, it's kind of clunky and heavy, but then you become used to it.
[03:35:28.294 --> 03:35:30.375]  It doesn't seem clunky anymore.
[03:35:30.675 --> 03:35:32.296]  You're habituated to it.
[03:35:32.336 --> 03:35:45.160]  Well, that's what you're being hit with, because when you find out one day when this thing blows and you're going to see a veritable who's who of who's been involved in this, but I want to bring in that Harry Potter.
[03:35:45.180 --> 03:35:48.361]  You know, there's a group of people out there in the world that is so evil.
[03:35:49.279 --> 03:35:51.582]  So medieval, so horrible.
[03:35:51.602 --> 03:35:54.364]  You got to ask yourself, what is evil?
[03:35:54.725 --> 03:36:00.831]  I don't want to get too philosophical right now, but I've been in the business of the legal biz for a long time, and I've seen some bad people.
[03:36:01.271 --> 03:36:06.316]  And for the most part, the people that I've seen in the criminal justice system, I would not call them evil.
[03:36:06.376 --> 03:36:10.260]  I call them opportunistic, stupid, desperate,
[03:36:10.820 --> 03:36:16.967]  Dumb, momentary lapses of any kind of conscious, you know, control.
[03:36:17.228 --> 03:36:19.270]  But not evil, because what is evil?
[03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:25.818]  Evil is a systematic, targeted sense of victimization of human beings for the sake of the horror.
[03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:33.656]  And Philip Zimbardo, who did, go back to the Stanford Prison Experiment, that was about in 1970.
[03:36:33.716 --> 03:36:40.121]  Stanley Milgram, in the Milgram Experiment, remember the shock test, in 1960.
[03:36:40.661 --> 03:36:44.404]  How is it that people become a part of this?
[03:36:44.584 --> 03:36:48.267]  How is it that seemingly rational people,
[03:36:49.188 --> 03:36:55.395]  Grow up and find themselves in these sick covens that we're looking at.
[03:36:55.475 --> 03:37:01.861]  And most people are doing everything in their power to look the other way, to say, this is exaggerated.
[03:37:02.122 --> 03:37:03.723]  This is some tinfoil hat.
[03:37:03.763 --> 03:37:05.585]  And by the way, it's not tinfoil, it's aluminum.
[03:37:05.945 --> 03:37:07.147]  We haven't worn tin in years.
[03:37:07.607 --> 03:37:12.172]  Like the great Gore Vidal says, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst.
[03:37:12.819 --> 03:37:16.020]  But right now, I'm looking at this notion of evil.
[03:37:16.060 --> 03:37:20.762]  We're seeing more Luciferian, Satanist... Satanist, rather.
[03:37:21.642 --> 03:37:24.423]  William Friedkin is talking about exorcism.
[03:37:24.463 --> 03:37:28.764]  He's talking about the Catholic Church and actually filming exorcisms in the devil.
[03:37:29.045 --> 03:37:35.227]  Remember Lucifer from the Latin, Lux Lucis, Light, Giver of Light, the Morning Star from Venus.
[03:37:35.907 --> 03:37:38.688]  All of this stuff right now is reminding us
[03:37:39.631 --> 03:37:56.395]  That what we have lived with for generations, for epochs, for eons, the notion of evil and the occult, Harry Potter, mysticism, warlocks and wizards and... It's real!
[03:37:56.975 --> 03:38:02.977]  This stuff is not... There are people who, as this particular show, there are people who are now espousing
[03:38:04.508 --> 03:38:10.392]  Connectivity to this, and let me also throw in a couple of things to really make this even more frightening.
[03:38:10.952 --> 03:38:16.056]  Number one, number one, there is a
[03:38:17.063 --> 03:38:19.644]  A psychology that is involved here.
[03:38:19.684 --> 03:38:21.205]  This is one of the things that fascinates me.
[03:38:21.645 --> 03:38:22.646]  Mob psychology.
[03:38:22.706 --> 03:38:39.615]  Gustave Le Bon did about mob, mobocracies, mob psychology, throngs, groups, passals, riots, people who coalesce together, sometimes to do good, when complete strangers
[03:38:40.195 --> 03:38:46.039]  Run out of offices to pick up a car that's flipped over on some innocent person.
[03:38:46.319 --> 03:38:53.584]  Sometimes we see human beings coalescing in this beautiful, this synergy of good.
[03:38:53.604 --> 03:38:55.145]  Well, we're not talking about that.
[03:38:55.585 --> 03:39:00.829]  But o'clockracies, mob rule, craze rule, cults.
[03:39:01.650 --> 03:39:06.033]  How is it that seemingly normal people would say brand me?
[03:39:06.193 --> 03:39:25.346]  How is it that they can be involved in something where all of their natural indications, all of the alarm systems which they would normally employ, that would be on red alert whenever there would be indications or indicia of this involving sex and children and
[03:39:26.701 --> 03:39:29.923]  How horrible is this, this world?
[03:39:30.003 --> 03:39:31.284]  And I know it's a minority case.
[03:39:31.304 --> 03:39:33.946]  I'm not saying that the whole world is contaminated and fetid.
[03:39:34.346 --> 03:39:36.268]  But look at what we're looking at right now.
[03:39:37.028 --> 03:39:38.529]  And what opened last night?
[03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:39.970]  Harry Potter!
[03:39:40.571 --> 03:39:49.397]  We have this love affair, this kind of a drive-by conversance with who these people are.
[03:39:49.917 --> 03:39:51.218]  Let me tell you something.
[03:39:52.079 --> 03:39:53.460]  You are capable of evil.
[03:39:54.236 --> 03:39:55.837]  Anybody is capable of evil.
[03:39:56.018 --> 03:40:07.307]  Your children, your family, if not watched, if not supervised, if the right situational dynamics happen, you could find yourself unfortunately in that situation.
[03:40:07.367 --> 03:40:12.751]  And I know it's horrible to say, but in any event, let's go to the phones, shall we?
[03:40:12.891 --> 03:40:14.312]  At 8, what's the number?
[03:40:14.332 --> 03:40:15.073]  It'd be nice if I had it.
[03:40:15.093 --> 03:40:15.153]  877-789-2559.
[03:40:15.173 --> 03:40:15.513]  Let's go to
[03:40:20.327 --> 03:40:23.929]  Let's go to, uh, there's so many great ones.
[03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:26.651]  How about Pastor Sam in Oklahoma?
[03:40:26.671 --> 03:40:28.172]  You're on the Alex Jones Show with Lionel.
[03:40:29.693 --> 03:40:30.393]  Hi, Lionel.
[03:40:30.413 --> 03:40:31.714]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:40:32.074 --> 03:40:35.136]  There's a legal case I'm following very closely.
[03:40:35.356 --> 03:40:38.158]  It is in the federal court of Brownsville, Texas.
[03:40:38.778 --> 03:40:47.303]  And in fact, the governor, Tomas Yarrington, is on the stand right now as we speak on this very day in Brownsville, Texas.
[03:40:48.121 --> 03:41:04.236]  Uh, this is a case that's received almost zero good investigative reporting, but it's important because Tomas Yarrington was very good friends with Rick Perry and with... Well, what is the case about... Pastor Sam, what is the case about exactly?
[03:41:04.316 --> 03:41:05.937]  Very, very quickly, succinctly.
[03:41:05.978 --> 03:41:07.499]  We don't know as much as you do, obviously.
[03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:08.720]  Yes, sir.
[03:41:09.021 --> 03:41:19.569]  The case is about the accusation that Tomas Yarrington was supporting the drug cartels and that he was taking money and laundering money for them.
[03:41:19.649 --> 03:41:24.773]  Things that we know that Bill Clinton did and things that we know that Bush Senior's CIA did all over the world.
[03:41:25.213 --> 03:41:32.439]  But this man, as a very viable presidential candidate in the last election, as his candidacy was rising,
[03:41:33.380 --> 03:41:39.741]  This accusation came, and it came out of the United States, out of the San Antonio Federal District Court and the DEA.
[03:41:40.121 --> 03:41:56.245]  So, after five years of hiding, he has been arrested in Italy, been in custody for a year, and just was extradited to the USA on Friday last, after close of business, and today he's in federal court in Brownsville, Texas.
[03:41:59.457 --> 03:42:01.138]  Pastor Tam, I want to thank you for your call.
[03:42:01.399 --> 03:42:19.814]  We are certainly going to be looking at that one, because I find that, you know, one of the things which I always caution folks with, be very, very careful when you put people on the stand, when you find yourself in the position of wanting to charge somebody with something, because oftentimes they can take the stand and say, you know what?
[03:42:20.919 --> 03:42:25.322]  I'll testify, but to a lot more than you had in mind.
[03:42:25.882 --> 03:42:32.866]  I always wanted to see what would happen if, when Manuel Noriega, remember, Carra de Piña, Pineapple Face, remember that?
[03:42:33.187 --> 03:42:38.109]  I always wanted to see, what would he possibly testify to and the like?
[03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:42.052]  We'll go on more and more when we talk about this DNC ridiculous lawsuit that's coming up.
[03:42:42.492 --> 03:42:42.792]  Our number 877...
[03:42:47.484 --> 03:42:47.984]  877-789-2539.
[03:42:48.024 --> 03:42:52.511]  Lionel with you, sitting in on InfoWars.
[03:42:52.651 --> 03:42:53.632]  Thanks to Alex Jones.
[03:42:53.973 --> 03:42:56.336]  We have more coming up, so stay tuned and pay attention!
[03:43:02.242 --> 03:43:02.822]  Alpha Power.
[03:43:03.182 --> 03:43:03.982]  Here's what you want to know.
[03:43:04.222 --> 03:43:10.184]  You want to go to MFWrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:43:10.864 --> 03:43:14.404]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:43:15.285 --> 03:43:23.226]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:43:23.766 --> 03:43:27.147]  The average male or female enhancement
[03:43:28.107 --> 03:43:31.088]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:43:31.368 --> 03:43:33.088]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:43:33.448 --> 03:43:38.530]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:43:38.830 --> 03:43:46.452]  They said your leading competitors might put six, seven dollars in, and you're putting 15, 20 dollars, 30 dollars, 40 dollars, depending on the product.
[03:43:46.792 --> 03:43:47.813]  We're good to go.
[03:44:02.128 --> 03:44:05.330]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:05.770 --> 03:44:07.091]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:44:07.572 --> 03:44:19.119]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:44:19.799 --> 03:44:28.665]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:44:29.105 --> 03:44:34.946]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:44:35.166 --> 03:44:39.827]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:44:40.327 --> 03:44:42.648]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:44:42.988 --> 03:44:44.348]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:44:44.728 --> 03:44:54.350]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:44:54.450 --> 03:44:56.551]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[03:44:57.131 --> 03:45:01.996]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:45:02.196 --> 03:45:11.025]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[03:45:12.250 --> 03:45:14.052]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:45:14.112 --> 03:45:21.220]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:27.426]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:45:28.127 --> 03:45:29.449]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:45:30.049 --> 03:45:49.108]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:54.316]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[03:45:54.636 --> 03:45:59.904]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[03:46:00.304 --> 03:46:01.366]  As above, so below.
[03:46:01.927 --> 03:46:05.051]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the mass scale.
[03:46:05.632 --> 03:46:06.733]  Most tiny of scales.
[03:46:07.233 --> 03:46:08.334]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:46:08.754 --> 03:46:10.215]  America is building its wall.
[03:46:10.636 --> 03:46:11.096]  Will it work?
[03:46:11.236 --> 03:46:11.756]  We don't know.
[03:46:12.237 --> 03:46:12.817]  Is Trump right?
[03:46:13.518 --> 03:46:15.619]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[03:46:16.119 --> 03:46:22.103]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[03:46:22.464 --> 03:46:28.368]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[03:46:29.088 --> 03:46:35.390]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:51.155]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[03:46:51.815 --> 03:46:54.197]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[03:46:54.837 --> 03:46:58.079]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:58.420 --> 03:47:02.122]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[03:47:06.145 --> 03:47:08.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:23.453 --> 03:47:26.241]  Well, I walked back down.
[03:47:27.603 --> 03:47:32.046]  Alrighty, Lionel, with you on InfoWars.
[03:47:32.066 --> 03:47:36.889]  I want to thank Alex Jones for allowing me the opportunity to be with you.
[03:47:36.949 --> 03:47:44.994]  I want to finish up with a couple of ideas, a couple of thoughts before we
[03:47:56.135 --> 03:47:57.336]  Forget this whole thing.
[03:47:57.696 --> 03:48:25.349]  First, as you know, this insane lawsuit last week, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and why they did it, I have not the foggiest idea, where the DNC is filing lawsuits against Russia, the GRU, the FSB, Jared Kushner, the Trump campaign, everybody except, everybody except Donald Trump.
[03:48:26.815 --> 03:48:27.836]  Now, this is the best part.
[03:48:28.896 --> 03:48:44.365]  When you do this, can you imagine the counterclaims, the cross-claims, the third-party actions, the intervening, the interveners, and all of this complex litigation where somebody then involves themselves in discovery?
[03:48:44.385 --> 03:48:50.008]  Hey, DNC, I'm one of the defendants.
[03:48:50.609 --> 03:48:55.912]  I want to see them, their servers at Hillary.
[03:48:56.744 --> 03:49:00.165]  Bleached, dried, or bleached, whatever they call them, stonewashed.
[03:49:00.545 --> 03:49:01.365]  I want to do that one.
[03:49:01.666 --> 03:49:03.426]  I want to talk about the Seth Rich thing.
[03:49:03.566 --> 03:49:03.786]  What?
[03:49:04.386 --> 03:49:05.667]  I want to talk about Seth Rich.
[03:49:05.707 --> 03:49:05.927]  Why?
[03:49:05.967 --> 03:49:19.851]  Because I believe in my defense that the reason for this is that it's actually, you didn't lose because of any kind of contamination or collusion, which by the way is not a law.
[03:49:20.583 --> 03:49:24.585]  There is no law, there is nothing in the Title 18 or anything called collusion.
[03:49:24.645 --> 03:49:27.607]  I don't know where this comes from, people just, I guess they just use it.
[03:49:28.307 --> 03:49:32.830]  It's like sometimes people will say, and he was found guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[03:49:32.970 --> 03:49:33.510]  It's like, what?
[03:49:34.371 --> 03:49:42.255]  Anywho, if somebody were to say, I want to pursue this particular theory that it was not
[03:49:43.129 --> 03:49:51.352]  Trump, per se, but maybe Seth Rich might have been the source of this particular thumb drive to Julian Assange, and I want information on that.
[03:49:51.732 --> 03:49:59.495]  And I also want, in the course of this, I want to subpoena and depose Anthony Weiner, and I want to find out who has that laptop.
[03:49:59.815 --> 03:50:02.536]  And you might say, wait a minute, where are you going with this?
[03:50:02.936 --> 03:50:04.497]  To defend my case.
[03:50:04.577 --> 03:50:06.057]  You've opened the door.
[03:50:06.138 --> 03:50:07.378]  You've opened it all.
[03:50:07.818 --> 03:50:09.919]  You have to give me the opportunity
[03:50:10.620 --> 03:50:17.325]  To exhaust and to explore every conceivable defense that I have.
[03:50:18.005 --> 03:50:22.589]  And if I file a counterclaim, then I can also seek discovery.
[03:50:22.749 --> 03:50:24.070]  This is going to go on forever.
[03:50:24.610 --> 03:50:26.952]  What motivated these people?
[03:50:27.172 --> 03:50:27.912]  I have no idea.
[03:50:27.972 --> 03:50:30.294]  By the way, do you believe in numerology?
[03:50:30.894 --> 03:50:31.795]  Here's one for you.
[03:50:32.215 --> 03:50:32.556]  The number 531.
[03:50:35.006 --> 03:50:35.906]  What is 531?
[03:50:36.026 --> 03:50:40.848]  Today is the 531st day, I believe, since the election of 2016.
[03:50:42.568 --> 03:50:49.731]  And in that time, the Democratic Party has come up with not a platform, a vision, an idea, anything.
[03:50:50.631 --> 03:50:51.071]  Nothing.
[03:50:52.048 --> 03:50:56.634]  The beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega of their particular idea is that they don't like Trump.
[03:50:56.714 --> 03:50:57.856]  They don't want Trump.
[03:50:57.916 --> 03:50:59.057]  They are not a part of Trump.
[03:50:59.458 --> 03:51:02.061]  They are not a big Trump fan.
[03:51:02.202 --> 03:51:02.702]  I got it.
[03:51:02.842 --> 03:51:04.004]  And that's wonderful.
[03:51:04.164 --> 03:51:05.306]  Good for them.
[03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:07.270]  What does that mean?
[03:51:07.310 --> 03:51:08.371]  Imagine you're going to a restaurant.
[03:51:08.571 --> 03:51:10.571]  Welcome to not McDonald's.
[03:51:10.852 --> 03:51:11.392]  What do you have?
[03:51:11.672 --> 03:51:13.352]  I don't know, but we're not McDonald's.
[03:51:13.612 --> 03:51:14.573]  I'd like to order something.
[03:51:14.833 --> 03:51:15.513]  It doesn't matter.
[03:51:15.853 --> 03:51:16.514]  Just anything.
[03:51:16.834 --> 03:51:17.634]  Yes, I understand that.
[03:51:17.794 --> 03:51:18.614]  But what do you have?
[03:51:19.034 --> 03:51:21.555]  Anything that make it makes no sense.
[03:51:21.735 --> 03:51:24.336]  Now, let me bring you up to speed on this one.
[03:51:25.097 --> 03:51:29.738]  Mike Flynn, Mike Flynn is being asked to stump in Montana during a race.
[03:51:29.958 --> 03:51:34.740]  Mike Flynn, if he does not have his
[03:51:35.521 --> 03:51:38.044]  If he does not withdraw a plea, and I'll explain this in a moment.
[03:51:39.126 --> 03:51:44.433]  If he does not withdraw his plea, I don't know when one should.
[03:51:45.254 --> 03:51:45.715]  Right now...
[03:51:46.770 --> 03:51:59.119]  If you think about this, Mr. Mueller, who I have heard from friends of mine in the business, friends of mine, people who have been in the government, in the DOJ, those who really know what they're talking about, have held him to the highest of esteem.
[03:51:59.419 --> 03:52:02.321]  And he must think to himself, how did I, how did this happen?
[03:52:02.761 --> 03:52:03.822]  This is my legacy.
[03:52:03.882 --> 03:52:04.322]  This is it.
[03:52:04.543 --> 03:52:05.383]  He's no Comey.
[03:52:05.463 --> 03:52:06.304]  Put Comey over here.
[03:52:06.524 --> 03:52:09.626]  And by the by, America has the attention span of a gnat.
[03:52:10.327 --> 03:52:11.768]  Remember Michael, Michael, um,
[03:52:12.526 --> 03:52:12.806]  Wolf.
[03:52:13.207 --> 03:52:13.707]  Remember Wolf?
[03:52:13.747 --> 03:52:14.448]  Remember that one in the book?
[03:52:14.628 --> 03:52:15.969]  The fire and the fury in this?
[03:52:16.189 --> 03:52:17.070]  Anybody remember that one?
[03:52:17.430 --> 03:52:23.835]  It was on every show, every day, on MSDNC, on CNN, on everything.
[03:52:24.175 --> 03:52:24.796]  Michael Wolf.
[03:52:24.916 --> 03:52:25.457]  Michael Wolf.
[03:52:25.497 --> 03:52:28.599]  This is going to end the Trump administration as you know it.
[03:52:28.859 --> 03:52:30.801]  Now, it's in the bargain bin.
[03:52:30.881 --> 03:52:31.842]  Nobody cares.
[03:52:32.242 --> 03:52:33.503]  Then Stormy Daniels.
[03:52:34.023 --> 03:52:35.264]  What was that about?
[03:52:35.565 --> 03:52:36.245]  Who knows?
[03:52:36.746 --> 03:52:37.206]  Gone.
[03:52:37.466 --> 03:52:38.387]  Once they used you.
[03:52:39.384 --> 03:52:48.710]  Once they desiccate you, once they suck out of you any relevance or importance that they will use as a foil against Trump, they discard you.
[03:52:49.150 --> 03:52:50.151]  So now we have Comey.
[03:52:50.891 --> 03:52:51.672]  Comey goes out.
[03:52:52.913 --> 03:53:09.196]  And he decides that he is going to literally bore the hell out of humanity with this horrible rendition of something which theoretically employs, I guess, something called entertainment.
[03:53:09.816 --> 03:53:14.097]  This is a guy who was worse than anything you can imagine.
[03:53:14.197 --> 03:53:22.158]  I have a personal theory that James Comey could reduce the teen pregnancy levels by explaining the sex act in detail.
[03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:28.313]  After five minutes of him explaining how intermission takes place, nobody would want to do it.
[03:53:28.654 --> 03:53:30.495]  He couldn't lure me out of a burning building.
[03:53:30.855 --> 03:53:35.038]  This disaster, this horrible disaster of a human being.
[03:53:35.418 --> 03:53:36.198]  So that's that.
[03:53:36.238 --> 03:53:44.683]  So anyway, Mueller, who was, from what people tell me, a good guy, a stand-up fellow, has indicted, let's see.
[03:53:45.544 --> 03:53:51.828]  First, it was Manafort and Gates in activities that predate and to date this presidency, number one.
[03:53:52.549 --> 03:53:56.330]  Then there were the 13 Russian bots, people we don't know who they were.
[03:53:57.350 --> 03:54:09.292]  It was on that Friday, right at the time when people were screaming and yelling at the FBI for not having done something to respond to the Parkland shooter before he became the Parkland shooter.
[03:54:09.893 --> 03:54:13.473]  Then, of course, there's Papadopoulos and Flynn.
[03:54:14.293 --> 03:54:16.854]  Now, why are their cases important?
[03:54:18.130 --> 03:54:21.531]  They pled guilty to lying.
[03:54:21.691 --> 03:54:23.551]  Lying to the federal government.
[03:54:23.711 --> 03:54:24.111]  18 U.S.C.
[03:54:24.372 --> 03:54:24.111]  1001.
[03:54:24.572 --> 03:54:26.632]  The basic, you lie to somebody.
[03:54:26.672 --> 03:54:30.553]  Remember, Martha Stewart was never prosecuted for insider trading.
[03:54:31.033 --> 03:54:32.974]  She basically lied to the FBI.
[03:54:33.354 --> 03:54:37.575]  And why her lawyer let her speak with anyone, I'll never know.
[03:54:37.915 --> 03:54:39.615]  But that's for another show.
[03:54:40.175 --> 03:54:43.216]  So your two main witnesses.
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:51.085]  Your two government witnesses have pled guilty to lying to the government.
[03:54:51.125 --> 03:54:52.886]  Remember, this is different than Sammy the Bull.
[03:54:53.945 --> 03:54:56.306]  Sammy the Bull, Vinnie Teresa, Joe Valachi.
[03:54:56.926 --> 03:54:57.826]  You're a killer.
[03:54:58.287 --> 03:54:58.687]  Yes.
[03:54:59.227 --> 03:55:00.748]  You pled guilty to killing.
[03:55:01.208 --> 03:55:01.648]  Yes.
[03:55:02.068 --> 03:55:04.949]  You killed on behalf of this Mafia Don.
[03:55:05.409 --> 03:55:05.849]  Yes.
[03:55:06.470 --> 03:55:07.350]  That's one thing.
[03:55:07.650 --> 03:55:07.890]  Why?
[03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:09.491]  Because only the killer would know this.
[03:55:10.031 --> 03:55:15.933]  Only the killer who's involved in contract killings would understand this level of organization that he does.
[03:55:16.393 --> 03:55:17.794]  Instead, we have this.
[03:55:18.194 --> 03:55:19.494]  State your name for the record.
[03:55:20.075 --> 03:55:20.955]  General Mike Flynn.
[03:55:21.698 --> 03:55:24.460]  You were fired for, what was that again?
[03:55:24.780 --> 03:55:26.221]  Oh yes, lying.
[03:55:27.281 --> 03:55:29.162]  You lied to Vice President Pence.
[03:55:29.242 --> 03:55:29.883]  Yes, I did.
[03:55:30.463 --> 03:55:33.805]  And you were, like, guilty to, what was that again?
[03:55:33.885 --> 03:55:35.226]  Oh yes, lying.
[03:55:35.906 --> 03:55:40.289]  You lied to the federal government and you admitted under oath to lying.
[03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:46.552]  So you lied to Vice President Pence, you lied to the federal government, but you're not lying now, right?
[03:55:47.113 --> 03:55:48.634]  And how do we know you're not lying?
[03:55:48.654 --> 03:55:49.174]  Do you give us
[03:55:49.890 --> 03:55:50.670]  A kind of a signal?
[03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:53.411]  Now, I'm not trying to make him out to be a bad guy.
[03:55:53.431 --> 03:56:06.615]  I am saying that when your chief witness, your main guy, your Joe Bellagio, your Sammy the Bull, you got him online at Papadopoulos, who even knows what he's about?
[03:56:07.075 --> 03:56:10.156]  So, Mueller right now is thinking, what do I do?
[03:56:11.096 --> 03:56:12.037]  What do I do?
[03:56:12.417 --> 03:56:16.338]  And then, when he heard Friday, the DNC did what?
[03:56:17.293 --> 03:56:22.197]  They're doing this now, because imagine the cross claims and the discovery in this.
[03:56:22.237 --> 03:56:24.739]  Look, it comes down to simply this.
[03:56:25.619 --> 03:56:40.130]  There is a move on this, on the part of, you can call it the deep state, shadow government, intel state, police state, wherever these people are, to get, to subvert, to reverse basically the franchise.
[03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:43.773]  This is a palace coup in action.
[03:56:44.133 --> 03:56:45.574]  You are seeing this unraveling.
[03:56:46.192 --> 03:56:58.495]  You are seeing also, and I want to leave you with this, and I want to say, if there is one thing that I want to see, I want to see Holly Weird and Petta Wood destroyed.
[03:56:58.655 --> 03:57:04.937]  As the great Frank Zappa said, and I will paraphrase, Hollywood is the entertainment arm of the Pentagon.
[03:57:05.397 --> 03:57:09.538]  If you can bring down Hollywood, if you can bring these folks down, in addition,
[03:57:10.123 --> 03:57:11.164]  To the aforementioned.
[03:57:11.564 --> 03:57:21.809]  If you can go back, remember this is the feeder system for funding, for contributions, for spreading the meme, and that also includes the Ted Baxter sock puppet media as well.
[03:57:22.349 --> 03:57:27.032]  When you see this crumble and be destroyed, which I hope you will see soon,
[03:57:27.722 --> 03:57:33.725]  You will see one of the greatest gifts that this administration will give this proud republic.
[03:57:33.926 --> 03:57:39.989]  The rumination, the end, the finale, the valedictory of this rancid, deep state cabal.
[03:57:40.909 --> 03:57:42.410]  Thank you so, so very much.
[03:57:42.630 --> 03:57:43.471]  I believe this is it.
[03:57:43.531 --> 03:57:44.992]  It is a pleasure to be with you.
[03:57:45.012 --> 03:57:47.533]  Alex Jones, thank you for all you do.
[03:57:47.553 --> 03:57:48.794]  Lionel with you.
[03:57:49.114 --> 03:57:50.415]  Proud to be here.
[03:57:50.435 --> 03:57:50.815]  Comment.

[03:58:10.276 --> 03:58:12.177]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.

[03:58:35.473 --> 03:58:42.118]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:58:42.699 --> 03:58:43.780]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
