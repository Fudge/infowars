[00:00:06.468 --> 00:00:07.250]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.595]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.041]  Turn your guns in, it's for the children.
[00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:31.044]  Set up a socialist America, it's for the children.
[00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:33.266]  Set up a communist America, it's for the children.
[00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:39.891]  Open the borders of Europe up to 80% military-age men to pour in 10 million plus for the children.
[00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.773]  Call them all children.
[00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:52.561]  Put 25-year-old Islamic invaders trained by ISIS and Al-Qaeda in public schools, in middle schools and high schools, and let them rape the children for the children.
[00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:58.388]  Call everyone invading the nation on the southern border a child.
[00:00:58.388 --> 00:00:59.789]  That's what Obama tried.
[00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.429]  It's incredible.
[00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am a historical expert on wide-spectrum news and analysis.
[00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:09.092]  That's why the globalists hate my guts.
[00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:19.035]  When we return in the next segment, I'm going to show you total, irrevocable, absolute, ultra-massive proof.
[00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.423]  That they know full well.
[00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:45.372]  That Trump is following standard policy set up nine years ago by Barack Hussein Obama, and that his policy was similar to that of George W. Bush, and follows standard policy that we've had since the days of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:55.021]  And I'm going to show you the news articles, the video clips, congressional debates with Dianne Feinstein, Hillary Clinton, all saying the same things just a few years ago.
[00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.393]  about the situation.
[00:01:57.393 --> 00:02:09.646]  When you capture thousands of people, sometimes a day, you don't just throw children in with a bunch of undocumented men and women, many of them coyotes, many of them criminals fleeing justice.
[00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:15.131]  If you do that, the children get raped, they get killed.
[00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:19.416]  That is standard procedure, but it gets even crazier.
[00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:31.358]  You've got the Democrats from New York to Texas running around beating on walls, saying, let us in, it's hot out here, when it's 72 degrees inside, implying that they're all dying.
[00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:45.607]  And you've got the former director of the CIA, Hayden, that creep, comparing it to Dachau and Buchenwald and Auschwitz, claiming that they're concentration camps.
[00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:49.990]  Unbelievable, insane stunts, but it gets even more wild.
[00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:58.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we return, the UN Human Rights Head said Trump's policy separating migrant families is abuse.
[00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:13.648]  Ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations is world famous for raping, murdering, and killing children they take from their families and sex trafficking them from
[00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:24.576]  The Balkans, to Africa, to Asia, to Latin America, and we're going to go over all of that.
[00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:30.101]  I made a film on the UN abuse of children.
[00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.782]  It's incredible.
[00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:31.943]  America destroyed by design.
[00:03:31.943 --> 00:03:34.385]  About a third of the two-hour film is on that subject.
[00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:36.987]  But just search engine, UN caught smuggling children.
[00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:39.730]  Hell, the UN just got caught in a huge Reuters report.
[00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:43.107]  In January of this year.
[00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:44.228]  Print that up.
[00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:49.514]  UN running giant child trafficking ring in Haiti.
[00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:51.696]  Print that for me please, crew.
[00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.258]  So, this is amazing.
[00:03:53.258 --> 00:03:54.359]  Yeah, United Nations.
[00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.361]  Peacekeepers caught running a child sex ring.
[00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.644]  2,000 plus cases of sexual abuse reported.
[00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.507]  Boom!
[00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.267]  That was a whole other case.
[00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.528]  It's unbelievable.
[00:04:04.528 --> 00:04:09.791]  But the way they hoax this, that Trump has concentration camps.
[00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:18.575]  Well, we've got exclusive video up on InfoWars.com where they go over what's really inside these facilities.
[00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:29.241]  And yes, they have chain-link fences inside these air-conditioned buildings so that people can't get in to hurt the children.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.183]  Because you also have people under 18 there, so you have to have the teenagers separate.
[00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:44.592]  And we're talking about full indoor gyms, we're talking about the equivalent of a nice 5A school, nice beds, everything.
[00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:48.415]  America, on average, takes better care of children anywhere else in the world.
[00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:57.703]  But the murderous globalist UN and the communist Chinese that actually sell people's organs, they're all lecturing Trump right now because they want totally open borders for globalism.
[00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:07.781]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:06.107 --> 00:06:06.987]  A few months ago...
[00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:44.623]  In early 2019, Peter Sutherland, the former head of the EU, former deputy director of the UN, who had made himself the head of the UN Global Migrant Initiative, died.
[00:06:44.623 --> 00:06:51.486]  But he lives on with the fact that the UN runs over a hundred major nation's immigration policy.
[00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:58.750]  Under UNESCO treaties that Trump pulled out of last year, since the days of William Jefferson Clinton, he entered UNESCO,
[00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:12.754]  The UN had been telling the State Department who could come in and who couldn't, and were quote, vetting the refugees, including Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters.
[00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:21.440]  Now, that's essential to understand, so we're not just looking at what's happening with the detained immigrant and migrant children.
[00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:37.211]  The children of illegal aliens invading, the parents abusing their children, taking them over thousands of miles through dangerous areas, through rattlesnakes, through the smugglers, the coyotes, through all of it.
[00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:45.154]  Obama's own Justice Department and ICE estimated 80% of women that are brought across the border by the coyotes
[00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:49.461]  are raped as a part of their passage.
[00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:50.863]  I'm going to show you that.
[00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:56.527]  But the parents doing that, if you or I did that, the CPS would take our children.
[00:07:56.527 --> 00:08:11.620]  We took our child out in the middle of a hundred-mile desert and said we're going to walk with our five-year-old across a hundred-mile desert, which is nothing compared to the thousand-mile treks they're making out of Central and South America up through Central America into Southern North America.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.561]  But if you went out
[00:08:13.663 --> 00:08:23.651]  With one backpack and your five-year-old and tried to march across it not knowing where you were going they would take your child for child endangerment and they should!
[00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:33.980]  But you've got a UN program that Trump pulled out of last year where in Nicaragua and El Salvador they have two UN missions that actually run the program
[00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:50.975]  To have them stack up at the border, and then get on top trains, and they have agreements with all those nations, that they can then go through on the tops of the trains, men, women, and children hanging on up to the US as part of a UN program to collapse our borders.
[00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:53.337]  They're using these poor, desperate people.
[00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:54.298]  And I wish we could help them.
[00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:58.097]  But the globalist program to collapse the U.S.
[00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:00.318]  is meant to bring everybody down.
[00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:04.579]  Look what the globalists have already done to successful countries in Latin America and Africa.
[00:09:04.579 --> 00:09:09.841]  They destroyed them the same way America is being destroyed with these policies.
[00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.662]  So I'm giving you the whole analysis here.
[00:09:11.662 --> 00:09:12.722]  But they don't want you to hear it.
[00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:16.183]  Everybody watching should tell friends, neighbors, family to listen and watch.
[00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:17.704]  You should tell them to tune in.
[00:09:17.704 --> 00:09:20.545]  You should tell them if you're watching on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube right now.
[00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:31.899]  Then if you want to know what's really going on and how big this media globalist hoax is, their next big push is to try to bring down Trump and America, just like Europe has opened borders.
[00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:41.861]  So, the UN runs it, Trump pulls out of it, so the very same Soros-funded, non-governmental organizations, I've got stacks of news here on the same thing in Europe, I'm going to tie it all together.
[00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:44.742]  The information they don't want you to have.
[00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:45.682]  This is the full spectrum.
[00:09:47.093 --> 00:09:52.537]  Now, now that you know that's going on, let's look at what's currently happening in the hysteria department.
[00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:57.421]  Then I'm getting to the really big news.
[00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:11.011]  The Democrats are branding this, and Hayden, the former head of the CIA, who was engaged in all, and the NSA, all the illegal behavior, what a sinister, twisted, looks like a Pixar, Disney villain.
[00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.753]  Zoom in on that sinister face.
[00:10:12.753 --> 00:10:13.974]  He compares Trump
[00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:30.854]  And the detention of these children while they vet their parents and find out who's criminal, who isn't, where they came from, who they are, he's comparing that to Auschwitz where hundreds of thousands, millions of people got processed and put into slave labor and many of them killed.
[00:10:30.854 --> 00:10:33.635]  Now, come on!
[00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:35.095]  Unbelievable!
[00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:41.197]  And of course footage has been released of the children in these facilities and they're like high schools, junior highs,
[00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:43.768]  And middle schools because they are.
[00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:54.071]  They're run by advisors from the local independent school districts who take the contracts and then they bring in substitute teachers and security and they run it the way you should.
[00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:59.173]  These are huge schools inside warehouses.
[00:10:59.173 --> 00:11:01.413]  I demanded coverage of this years ago.
[00:11:01.413 --> 00:11:05.115]  I made a big deal about it 10 years ago when it started if you remember.
[00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:06.375]  Ventura did a show on it.
[00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:09.816]  And they actually released footage then and I had to shut my mouth.
[00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:17.810]  Because I knew they had some real FEMA camps, and I wanted to know why there were, you know, jungle gyms and stuff in Round Rock up there, and I went and found out.
[00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.412]  So I'm an expert on this.
[00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:21.212]  But let's continue.
[00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:23.294]  And I'm not bragging, I'm just saying this is a fact.
[00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:25.415]  If you're a TV viewer, you see how great these facilities are.
[00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:28.898]  Can you look at the numbers of problems coming out of them?
[00:11:28.898 --> 00:11:36.803]  It's almost non-existent, because these poor children out of Latin America and other areas are so happy to be somewhere safe.
[00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:37.584]  Now let's continue.
[00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:47.521]  You got the Democrats running to New York, running to Texas, and then going, oh, it's hot, it's 100 degrees, oh, the children are dying inside, oh, they're dying.
[00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:53.465]  Then they get inside, even CNN has to admit, they had thermometers, the Democrats did, they had to admit it was 72.
[00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.066]  That's in my articles.
[00:11:56.066 --> 00:12:00.389]  Some say that's too cold, it's too hot, it's too cold.
[00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:01.690]  76 is about the average, they say.
[00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.892]  72 degrees.
[00:12:03.892 --> 00:12:05.713]  Yeah, we like our air conditioning down here in Texas.
[00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:11.887]  So, Obama started this whole program.
[00:12:11.887 --> 00:12:18.049]  And then again, they've got chain link fences in the warehouses on the outside so adults can't get into them, they're unauthorized.
[00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:20.049]  Some of the cots are up against the edges.
[00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:25.951]  They used some of these photos before the facilities got upgraded, but it's Obama era.
[00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:30.392]  Now let's continue.
[00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:34.833]  80% of Central American women, girls are raped crossing into the U.S.
[00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:41.977]  This is last year, the center, and it breaks it all down.
[00:12:41.977 --> 00:12:43.999]  Numbers from the Justice Department and ICE.
[00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:46.162]  80% of women and girls crossing in the U.S.
[00:12:46.162 --> 00:12:47.964]  by way of Mexico are raped during their journey.
[00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:51.829]  That's up from the previous estimate of 60% according to Amnesty International.
[00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:53.812]  And then it goes into ICE agreeing with that number.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.741]  Here's a CNN article from last year.
[00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:59.924]  The deadly toll of human smuggling and trafficking in the U.S.
[00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:07.830]  It's estimated that there's over 200,000 people dead that they don't know about, but they've already found over 100,000 dead and another 100,000 shot.
[00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.555]  Most of them being robbed when they tried to come up through Mexico.
[00:13:13.555 --> 00:13:20.601]  It is beyond road warrior in northern Mexico and how these folks are being fed on by these evil gangs.
[00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:27.259]  The Mexican Mafia, MS-13, all these other groups.
[00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:28.400]  Now, do you hear that humanized?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.261]  Do you hear that covered?
[00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:30.702]  No, no, no, no!
[00:13:30.702 --> 00:13:31.843]  You have adults showing up.
[00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:34.887]  You'll catch 20, 30, 40, 50 people at a time.
[00:13:34.887 --> 00:13:35.787]  Men, women, and children.
[00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:38.364]  Some of them dehydrated, whatever.
[00:13:38.364 --> 00:13:41.465]  And of course, you go, women here, men here, kids here.
[00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:43.326]  You process, you find out who people are.
[00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:44.327]  They go through the whole thing.
[00:13:44.327 --> 00:13:49.649]  And then if you're here and have a criminal background and have already been here before, you go to jail and your kids go to CPS.
[00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:55.852]  If you're a rapist or a murderer, others, you get deported back to Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Brazil.
[00:13:58.643 --> 00:13:59.704]  What are we supposed to do?
[00:13:59.704 --> 00:14:04.951]  Oh, here, we got a hundred people we picked up today coming over the river or, you know, crawling across the desert.
[00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.594]  Here, let's just throw them all in to a holding tank.
[00:14:11.608 --> 00:14:14.550]  That would be insane abuse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.751]  Oh, but guess who does that?
[00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:21.335]  The UN throws people into big, giant, sports stadium-style holding tanks.
[00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:23.156]  And we're going to cover that when we come back.
[00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:30.661]  I have hundreds of mainstream news articles admitting unbelievable amounts of men, women, and children murdered, sex traffic killed by the UN.
[00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:34.179]  Oh, but guess who's been suing Trump?
[00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:35.100]  And guess who's involved?
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.583]  The UN Human Rights Head.
[00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:41.267]  Trump policy separating families is abuse.
[00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:45.010]  He goes on to say it's government-sanctioned abuse.
[00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.813]  Harming children.
[00:14:47.813 --> 00:14:54.300]  That is like Satan just, you know, telling a regular person they're the devil.
[00:14:55.618 --> 00:14:59.241]  It's like Hitler telling somebody they're a Nazi when they're not even a Nazi.
[00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.042]  But remember, what is Hayden saying?
[00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:05.025]  That little creep who's been caught lying to Congress and spying illegally and all the rest is garbage.
[00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:07.907]  He says it's like Auschwitz.
[00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.628]  He says it's like Nazi Germany.
[00:15:09.628 --> 00:15:13.551]  And you got the Democrat lawmakers angry with what they saw in South Texas.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.105]  But then we have the shock video on InfoWars.com from Information Liberation inside Trump's concentration camp for immigrant children.
[00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:26.949]  And I can't believe it's nicer than many of the public schools I've seen.
[00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:36.656]  There's a ton of the footage, indoor gyms, everything, food, air conditioning, schools, the whole nine yards regimented.
[00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:39.708]  Probably the best they've had in their life.
[00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:42.911]  That's the evil of the concentration camps!
[00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:43.853]  Playing volleyball!
[00:15:43.853 --> 00:15:44.994]  Playing soccer!
[00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:46.376]  Oh my god, it's so horrible!
[00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:47.337]  Jungle gyms!
[00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:48.799]  Everything!
[00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:51.662]  Waits and tracks for the older children!
[00:15:51.662 --> 00:15:57.189]  Meanwhile, the UN literally runs giant child kidnapping rings in death camps and exterminated a million people in Rwanda.
[00:15:59.773 --> 00:16:00.574]  This is Dan Pilla.

[00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:03.862]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.862 --> 00:18:05.644]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:16.913]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.674 --> 00:18:26.740]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:37.407]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:40.529]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:42.271]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:52.259]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:54.901]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:59.625]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.666]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:04.827]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:19:04.827 --> 00:19:08.748]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.321]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:45.342]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:19:46.332 --> 00:19:49.636]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:51.659]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:54.963]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:19:54.963 --> 00:19:57.506]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[00:19:57.506 --> 00:20:02.892]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:05.556]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:46.124]  The President is speaking right now with Vice President Pence about the whole media hoax, the UN-run global hoax that we've got children in concentration camps.
[00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:48.045]  It's unbelievable.
[00:20:48.045 --> 00:20:57.828]  And if you just joined us, I was breaking down earlier all of that, and the proof of it, and the history of it, and just how insane all of this is.
[00:20:57.828 --> 00:20:59.629]  It is mind-blowing.
[00:20:59.629 --> 00:21:02.130]  So, he's still live as we speak.
[00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:07.457]  And we're going to go back to the beginning of his statements coming up in this hour and play them.
[00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:08.598]  But they were powerful.
[00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:12.059]  He said people are dying in mass coming over the border.
[00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:13.920]  He said they're killing people once they get here.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.301]  It's totally lawless.
[00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:16.782]  Latin America has collapsed.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.982]  You've got the Democrats lying about what's going on.
[00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:35.010]  But if you just joined us, this whole push about children in concentration camps, and this is like Nazi Germany, and the Democrats and the Republicans saying it, is their desperation to make America turn against Trump and turn against prosperity.
[00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.032]  It's just that simple.
[00:21:37.032 --> 00:21:38.373]  And it's diabolical.
[00:21:38.373 --> 00:21:39.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, 80% of the women
[00:21:41.616 --> 00:21:47.040]  Coming in to the United States through Mexico get raped, according to Amnesty International.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.902]  That is the Huffington Post-owned admission.
[00:21:49.902 --> 00:21:54.506]  You have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people killed already in the last decade in Mexico.
[00:21:54.506 --> 00:21:59.830]  Many of them the ones trying to come in to the United States.
[00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:05.314]  And then you've got the United Nations running this huge, gigantic hoax.
[00:22:08.462 --> 00:22:14.685]  UN Human Rights Head Trump Policy Separating Migrant Families Is Abuse.
[00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:16.146]  That's the head of that program.
[00:22:16.146 --> 00:22:18.367]  Now that's in the Hill today.
[00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:19.808]  But they think you don't have a memory.
[00:22:19.808 --> 00:22:20.748]  Look at this article.
[00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:25.211]  UN Peacekeepers Caught Running Massive Child Sex Ring Not One Person Jailed.
[00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:30.733]  Reuters broke all that down earlier this year.
[00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:32.674]  There's AP.
[00:22:32.674 --> 00:22:33.755]  Now let's go back to AP.
[00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:40.258]  Think about that.
[00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:42.540]  AP exclusive.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.644]  UN child sex ring.
[00:22:46.644 --> 00:22:50.147]  Left victims, but no arrest because it was the UN doing it.
[00:22:50.147 --> 00:22:53.430]  Tens of thousands of children, many of them ended up dead.
[00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.752]  Hundreds were found dead.
[00:22:55.752 --> 00:22:58.355]  Raped, murdered, decapitated, snuff filmed.
[00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:01.960]  That's the UN Peacekeeper Specialty all over the world.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.201]  It's known for that.
[00:23:03.201 --> 00:23:05.663]  I've made films about it.
[00:23:05.663 --> 00:23:09.446]  21 years ago, I made my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:16.452]  A third of it is about UN sex crimes with mainstream articles and videos.
[00:23:16.452 --> 00:23:22.397]  I had to blur it out, but we've got them raping children, torturing them, and roasting them over fires and eating them.
[00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:28.637]  In my film, America Destroyed by Design, we have the U.N.
[00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:34.483]  roasting and eating children.
[00:23:34.483 --> 00:23:36.945]  Roasting and eating children.
[00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:38.186]  U.N.
[00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:40.809]  peacekeepers caught running a child sex ring.
[00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:44.052]  2,000 plus cases of sexual abuse reported.
[00:23:44.052 --> 00:23:46.574]  That's A.P.!
[00:23:46.574 --> 00:23:48.196]  The child sex ring run by the U.N.
[00:23:48.196 --> 00:23:49.137]  peacekeepers in Haiti.
[00:23:51.564 --> 00:23:53.104]  Here's another one.
[00:23:53.104 --> 00:23:54.905]  UN failed Rwanda.
[00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:56.265]  They didn't fail.
[00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:57.886]  They came in in 1994.
[00:23:57.886 --> 00:23:59.226]  Bill Clinton oversaw it.
[00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:00.027]  They stood down.
[00:24:00.027 --> 00:24:06.268]  They put the minority Christian tribe in camps and killed over a million of them.
[00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:07.589]  And the UN oversaw it.
[00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:14.271]  And there's videos and photos of the UN raping and robbing the women and children and then killing them with machetes and machine guns.
[00:24:16.528 --> 00:24:17.149]  Exclusive!
[00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:18.309]  Rwanda revisited.
[00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:29.758]  Former President Clinton said he never knew the extent of suffering during Iran's genocide, but American diplomats on the ground knew exactly what was happening, and they told Washington, and were told to stand down.
[00:24:29.758 --> 00:24:34.122]  That's foreignpolicy.com, globalist publication.
[00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:46.027]  Globalist publication 2015 documenting everything I said in my film America Destroyed by Design.
[00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:48.948]  Shove that down your throat so-called liberals.
[00:24:48.948 --> 00:24:54.071]  When you point your fingers at Trump and air-conditioned facilities that by law
[00:24:56.078 --> 00:25:05.166]  Set up decades ago, the children come into, because they're with all these adults, they don't know who's who, they've got to vet them, put them into the database.
[00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:18.399]  You don't put children in general population in these immigrant detention centers that every other country has, unless you're Germany or Europe, where they open their borders up.
[00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:21.682]  80% of Central American women, girls are raped crossing into the US.
[00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:24.514]  Deadly toll.
[00:25:24.514 --> 00:25:25.875]  It's all right here.
[00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:27.056]  London Independent.
[00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:27.256]  U.N.
[00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:30.678]  peacekeepers in Haiti implicated in child sex ring.
[00:25:30.678 --> 00:25:34.580]  On and on and on and on and on.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.541]  I mean, you can go to Bing Images.
[00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:37.762]  Google censors everything now.
[00:25:37.762 --> 00:25:39.083]  Or other search engines.
[00:25:39.083 --> 00:25:39.743]  Type in U.N.
[00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:41.484]  peacekeepers killing children.
[00:25:41.484 --> 00:25:41.664]  U.N.
[00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:43.865]  peacekeepers raping children.
[00:25:43.865 --> 00:25:44.626]  And you will get
[00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:48.356]  Der Spiegel!
[00:25:48.356 --> 00:25:52.397]  You'll get the Moscow Times, you'll get the Japanese newspapers.
[00:25:52.397 --> 00:25:53.237]  Hardly any U.S.
[00:25:53.237 --> 00:25:56.678]  news, but you can see it for yourself.
[00:25:56.678 --> 00:26:05.041]  But the biggest ones were the whistleblowers, the congressional hearings about Kosovo, and also about Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:12.564]  Remember that there have been Hollywood movies made about it, where they were loading kids on C-130s, the UN, and flying them out to the Middle East, to these sex dungeons?
[00:26:13.985 --> 00:26:20.109]  Just like the Lolita Express with Epstein and Weinstein and Clinton?
[00:26:20.109 --> 00:26:21.510]  I mean, these people got a lot of nerve.
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:28.855]  They're the ones, the UN running, industrial level child kidnapping and sex abuse and kidnapping women?
[00:26:28.855 --> 00:26:29.656]  That's a whole other area.
[00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:30.516]  It's even bigger.
[00:26:30.516 --> 00:26:31.237]  The UN.
[00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:34.879]  Type in UN trafficking, kidnap women.
[00:26:34.879 --> 00:26:36.841]  You'll get Guardian, AP, Reuters.
[00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:40.543]  I mean, confirmed.
[00:26:40.543 --> 00:26:42.625]  Absolutely, totally confirmed.
[00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:45.282]  Massive sex crimes, U.S.
[00:26:45.282 --> 00:26:49.766]  Congressional hearings, but zero coverage here in the U.S.
[00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:51.407]  media.
[00:26:51.407 --> 00:26:52.928]  And it's all been confirmed now.
[00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:54.490]  The Democrats try to whitewash it.
[00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.530]  But don't worry.
[00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:06.379]  Oh, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, Hayden, says it's like Auschwitz and Dachau and Buchenwald, Nazi Germany, and Trump's a Nazi and the Democrats are banging on the doors.
[00:27:06.379 --> 00:27:07.540]  We ought to roll some of that footage.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.380]  Let us in!
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.942]  Oh, we demand to see the babies!
[00:27:10.942 --> 00:27:11.463]  They let him in.
[00:27:13.971 --> 00:27:19.413]  It's all nice, 72 degrees?
[00:27:19.413 --> 00:27:22.954]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:26.936]  Oh, these Democrats care so much about your children.
[00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:29.457]  They care so much.
[00:27:29.457 --> 00:27:33.458]  And they've got all the regular Democrat lawyers running along behind everybody.
[00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.719]  These people are unbelievable.
[00:27:35.719 --> 00:27:39.020]  Trying to humanize people, we're treating like humans.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.901]  When the global is treating everybody else like dog meat,
[00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:50.104]  And they're just trying to create an idea that we can't have a border and we can't hold anybody that pours across our border when they are abusing their children, bringing them across.
[00:27:50.104 --> 00:27:52.809]  And a lot of the kids, it turns out, have to go through databases.
[00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:53.831]  They've been kidnapped!
[00:27:54.858 --> 00:27:59.879]  A lot of times they're children that other people have that were grabbed from their parents who were killed on the way up.
[00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:04.240]  What do you think happens to the hundreds of thousands of people that have been dug up in mass graves all over Mexico?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.680]  A lot of times their kids aren't with them.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.361]  They're taken.
[00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:07.201]  They're smuggled.
[00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:09.841]  And the Democrats have been caught all over the U.S.
[00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:15.463]  fencing the kids through the Catholic Church instead of, quote, through the normal government aid agencies.
[00:28:15.463 --> 00:28:20.664]  Obama only started that the last few years and was segwaying, this is a real scandal,
[00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:25.571]  Out of keeping them in the detention centers and processing them and just loading them on buses.
[00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:26.551]  Remember we broke that?
[00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:31.894]  But they were just loading them on buses and then shipping them to Catholic charities.
[00:28:31.894 --> 00:28:36.376]  Oh, give a bunch of little kids to the Catholic priest and all the other perverts with them.
[00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:37.497]  Isn't that a great idea?
[00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:41.905]  I must say, all Catholic priests are, but the special Democrat Party ones.
[00:28:41.905 --> 00:28:44.386]  Gonna pull up Ja'kari Jackson's report on that from four years ago.
[00:28:44.386 --> 00:28:45.967]  We were the first to break that.
[00:28:45.967 --> 00:28:47.407]  Drudge linked to it.
[00:28:47.407 --> 00:28:51.168]  Where they were just loading them onto buses and just disappearing kids.
[00:28:51.168 --> 00:28:51.889]  Oh, really?
[00:28:51.889 --> 00:28:53.169]  That's totally illegal.
[00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:54.670]  But Obama did it.
[00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.230]  We'll be back.
[00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.650]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:04.048]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon Living Water Bottle.

[00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:41.356]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:47.020]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.482]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:53.604]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:31:59.983 --> 00:32:03.925]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:07.207]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.207 --> 00:32:13.470]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.252]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:16.992 --> 00:32:20.814]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:27.279]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:32.242]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:32.987 --> 00:32:36.910]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:44.114]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.114 --> 00:32:49.338]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.338 --> 00:32:55.021]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.021 --> 00:32:59.004]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.883 --> 00:33:11.205]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.205 --> 00:33:13.966]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.222 --> 00:33:38.505]  I am so outraged right now.
[00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:49.193]  I am boiling angry right now that the mainstream media is so deceptive, so brazen, so over-the-top arrogant that they think they can sell the hoax that the U.S.
[00:33:49.193 --> 00:34:00.362]  has children from Latin America and other areas that are pouring in illegally with smugglers, their parents that are endangering them, you name it, and they're being put in clean, nice,
[00:34:00.842 --> 00:34:10.185]  Facilities that are set up as schools while we find out who the hell they came in with through the hundreds of thousands that have been killed trying to get into the U.S.
[00:34:10.185 --> 00:34:13.627]  by the murderous, barbarous gangs in Mexico.
[00:34:13.627 --> 00:34:25.031]  And to have that turned around and to have Democratic Congress people banging on doors saying it's hot out here and they get inside and it's 72 degrees and they go, well, doesn't matter, you should let them go.
[00:34:26.007 --> 00:34:30.628]  Like Obama started doing before he followed the US law and the kids got taken care of.
[00:34:30.628 --> 00:34:37.790]  But he started loading them on buses and shipping them to Democrat and Catholic charities run by the Democrats, just disappearing them.
[00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.271]  Many of them found in sex trafficking.
[00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:43.312]  And I've got even CNN reporting that right here.
[00:34:43.312 --> 00:34:49.734]  So let's just let kids randomly show up with who the hell knows who and then just turn them loose into the US.
[00:34:51.274 --> 00:35:04.325]  That is completely evil, but we first documented that four years ago with Jakari Jackson and Adon Salazar, where we caught the buses in McAllen, Texas, and the local emergency manager saying, look, here's the order.
[00:35:04.325 --> 00:35:08.929]  Obama told us, let them in, load them on buses, and they're sent to Democrat charities.
[00:35:08.929 --> 00:35:14.574]  Folks, Hillary's top lady got caught in Haiti trying to ship out a bunch of kids without documentation.
[00:35:14.574 --> 00:35:14.854]  Remember?
[00:35:14.854 --> 00:35:18.778]  And she got a major smuggling charge and was convicted.
[00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.452]  But when the President ordered it, it still happened.
[00:35:22.452 --> 00:35:25.414]  Think about the smoke screen they're using here.
[00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:27.515]  And how huge this is.
[00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:36.241]  That you've got the former head of the CIA, Hayden, saying that this is like concentration camps for the kids.
[00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:39.503]  And that all of this is going on.
[00:35:39.503 --> 00:35:43.186]  The Democrats yelling and screaming, saying there's no air conditioning until they get inside.
[00:35:43.186 --> 00:35:44.787]  All Trump's doing is following U.S.
[00:35:44.787 --> 00:35:46.668]  law.
[00:35:46.668 --> 00:35:47.729]  And then you get the U.N.
[00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.630]  coming out, saying that
[00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:54.603]  This is like a concentration camp and Trump is a criminal.
[00:35:54.603 --> 00:36:04.909]  When the UN has this incredible history of mass sex slavery in Africa, in Haiti, in the Balkans, in Asia, in Latin America, it is incredible.
[00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:06.870]  There's AP on screen.
[00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.692]  Unbelievable!
[00:36:09.692 --> 00:36:14.595]  We were in Haiti months before that broke and first reported on it with senators in Haiti.
[00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:26.613]  Just like we reported on and broke the latest mole in the Trump campaign and the last two moles, we're going to break more in the next segment with Roger Stone exclusively and Matt Bracken with his analysis.
[00:36:26.613 --> 00:36:31.114]  But let me, because I was mentioning it, get to the President's speech.
[00:36:31.114 --> 00:36:36.976]  It's still ongoing, but the first is very, very powerful, where he lays it all out.
[00:36:36.976 --> 00:36:40.417]  We're live linked to it on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:45.419]  The President exposes the massive hoax that
[00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:48.051]  He's even in control of this.
[00:36:48.051 --> 00:36:49.492]  He's just following the law.
[00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:54.378]  He defaulted back to the law that Obama started violating halfway into his presidency.
[00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:59.123]  First four years Obama followed the law, put them in these detention centers, they weren't as nice?
[00:36:59.123 --> 00:37:02.267]  They've been beefed up and made nicer?
[00:37:02.267 --> 00:37:04.410]  He's making the children's detention centers great again?
[00:37:05.387 --> 00:37:07.768]  But with Obama, put our article back up during his speech.
[00:37:07.768 --> 00:37:23.276]  I want to show people our article from four years ago with the HD footage of the emergency manager saying we're ordered to not even ask who they are, load them, men, women, children up in buses and just sometimes unaccounted 10-year-olds and just ship them to Illinois, you name it.
[00:37:23.276 --> 00:37:23.556]  Wow!
[00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:32.981]  Can you imagine you're going to an airport and you come in and there's some little kids there and the government just takes them and says we're going to just turn them loose outside the airport to some random people?
[00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.142]  You'd say, is this a movie?
[00:37:35.871 --> 00:37:37.052]  They do it.
[00:37:37.052 --> 00:37:42.877]  And then when we try to stop it, they turn it around that we put kids in a frickin' concentration camp.
[00:37:42.877 --> 00:37:45.799]  America defeated Hitler.
[00:37:45.799 --> 00:37:49.062]  Now the Democrats have said they want to put conservatives in re-education centers.
[00:37:49.062 --> 00:37:51.264]  That's in major bills.
[00:37:51.264 --> 00:37:52.445]  But that's their political enemies.
[00:37:52.445 --> 00:37:56.128]  Hell, Hillary said we want fun camps for men.
[00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:57.269]  They've said they want to re-educate us.
[00:37:57.269 --> 00:37:59.551]  They've turned the colleges into these re-education camps.
[00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:02.528]  This is not happening to these children.
[00:38:02.528 --> 00:38:03.388]  They're being well taken care of.
[00:38:03.388 --> 00:38:04.689]  I have investigated it.
[00:38:04.689 --> 00:38:08.551]  Because I would investigate real FEMA centers and ran to some of these.
[00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:11.132]  And these are simply following law.
[00:38:11.132 --> 00:38:12.193]  They're well taken care of.
[00:38:12.193 --> 00:38:13.734]  Some of their parents are allowed into the country.
[00:38:13.734 --> 00:38:14.394]  They're not criminals.
[00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:15.375]  If they're not, they're shipped back.
[00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:19.096]  A lot of times they're being smuggled in by people that aren't even their parents or family.
[00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:24.439]  They're catching kids being smuggled in for the hungry market of child molesters in the U.S.
[00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:26.440]  and their spokespersons, the Democratic Party.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.321]  That's who they are.
[00:38:27.321 --> 00:38:29.002]  It's why Salon, it's why
[00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:38.596]  The New York Times, it's why HBO, Vice is now promoting pedophilia because they want to normalize what they are into.
[00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:52.571]  They catch Democrats all the time on underground sex slave things in Austin, and it's always like the mayor's brother or city councilman's brother and their coyotes here in Austin beating people with baseball bats to suck money out of them.
[00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:55.632]  And if they don't do good, they're found dead in the desert.
[00:38:55.632 --> 00:39:00.673]  But then Robert Rodriguez makes movies where Don Johnson, the gringo, shoots the pregnant Mexican.
[00:39:00.673 --> 00:39:01.593]  That's not happening.
[00:39:01.593 --> 00:39:02.754]  The gringos aren't doing that.
[00:39:02.754 --> 00:39:04.634]  I dare you to find one case out of a million.
[00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:06.826]  By the Vice President of the United States.
[00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:53.542]  Thank you very much everybody.
[00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:54.523]  Thank you very much.
[00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:57.405]  This is an incredible time for our country.
[00:39:57.405 --> 00:40:02.948]  I would say that our economy, and many of you know that very well, is doing better than it ever has done.
[00:40:02.948 --> 00:40:11.292]  Our employment numbers are the best that they've been, perhaps ever, but certainly in recorded history.
[00:40:11.292 --> 00:40:14.814]  Reports just came out, best in 44 years.
[00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:17.335]  Black unemployment is the lowest level in history.
[00:40:17.335 --> 00:40:19.817]  Hispanic unemployment, lowest level in history.
[00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:24.459]  Women, unemployment, lowest level in 21 years.
[00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:28.003]  It started at 19, went up to 20, now it's up to 21.
[00:40:28.003 --> 00:40:31.327]  Very soon it's going to be in history.
[00:40:31.327 --> 00:40:38.355]  We're doing numbers like we've never seen and we have some of the great industry leaders here today who I'm going to be introducing in a little while.
[00:40:39.502 --> 00:40:46.907]  Quickly, and they're going to do so much with NASA and so many of the great things we're doing, but they understand full well what's happening.
[00:40:46.907 --> 00:40:48.688]  We've never seen a period of time like this.
[00:40:48.688 --> 00:40:53.571]  The whole world is looking up to the United States, and the United States is respected again.
[00:40:53.571 --> 00:40:58.214]  It was a period of time we were not so respected, not so long ago.
[00:40:58.214 --> 00:41:01.236]  The United States is respected again.
[00:41:01.236 --> 00:41:06.139]  If I might, I just wanted to make a brief statement on immigration and what's happening.
[00:41:07.928 --> 00:41:13.571]  And I'll say it very honestly, and I'll say it very straight.
[00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:18.893]  Immigration is the fault in all of the problems that we're having.
[00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.015]  Because we cannot get them to sign legislation.
[00:41:22.015 --> 00:41:25.937]  We cannot get them even to the negotiating table.
[00:41:25.937 --> 00:41:30.299]  And I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault.
[00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:32.620]  They're obstructionists, and they are obstructing.
[00:41:35.714 --> 00:41:45.879]  The United States will not be a migrant camp, and it will not be a refugee holding facility.
[00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:47.400]  Won't be.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:53.423]  You look at what's happening in Europe, you look at what's happening in other places, we can't allow that to happen to the United States.
[00:41:53.423 --> 00:41:56.124]  Not on my watch.
[00:41:56.124 --> 00:42:03.548]  For the rest of the world, you look at everything that's taking place, pick up your newspapers this morning, and you see.
[00:42:04.574 --> 00:42:09.116]  We want safety and we want security for our country.
[00:42:09.116 --> 00:42:17.820]  If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing, we could have something done very quickly.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:22.963]  Good for the children, good for the country, good for the world.
[00:42:22.963 --> 00:42:24.824]  It could take place quickly.
[00:42:24.824 --> 00:42:27.205]  We could have an immigration bill.
[00:42:27.205 --> 00:42:29.486]  We could have child separation.
[00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:31.247]  We're stuck with these horrible laws.
[00:42:32.844 --> 00:42:34.706]  They're horrible laws.
[00:42:34.706 --> 00:42:37.288]  What's happening is so sad.
[00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.610]  It's so sad.
[00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.532]  We're going to stop right there.
[00:42:41.532 --> 00:42:41.912]  That's right.
[00:42:41.912 --> 00:42:44.715]  A lot of these laws were passed by Bill Clinton.
[00:42:44.715 --> 00:42:47.417]  And he's trying to reform it.
[00:42:47.417 --> 00:42:50.540]  The Democrats just say, total open borders, let the UN run it all.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.422]  We've got more of this coming up.
[00:42:52.422 --> 00:42:58.027]  But first, big exclusive news with Roger Stone, Matt Bracken, and more as Russiagate completely implodes.

[00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:06.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:14.518]  This is Roger Stone with Breaking News.
[00:47:14.518 --> 00:47:28.855]  Today, I sent a letter to Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee to inform him of yet another FBI effort to infiltrate the Trump campaign and compromise Donald Trump himself.
[00:47:29.836 --> 00:47:41.670]  In May of 2016, I was approached by a man named Henry Greenberg, or at least that's the alias that he used, who said he had valuable information on the Clintons.
[00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:46.957]  After meeting him for 20 minutes, he told me that the information would cost $2 million.
[00:47:48.098 --> 00:48:01.209]  When I told him that not only did I not have $2 million, but even if I did have it, I didn't pay for political information, he laughed and said it wasn't my money he wanted, it was Donald Trump's.
[00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:04.972]  I told him that Trump didn't pay for information either.
[00:48:04.972 --> 00:48:07.094]  And that was the end of the meeting.
[00:48:07.734 --> 00:48:24.205]  Now, however, we have learned that Henry Greenberg is a longtime Russian national, but an FBI informant who has had numerous waivers to get in and out of the country at the sufferance of the FBI.
[00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:34.672]  This is clearly, like the situation with Steph Halper, yet another attempt to infiltrate and compromise the Trump campaign.
[00:48:34.672 --> 00:48:36.673]  This is Roger Stone with Breaking News.
[00:48:38.014 --> 00:48:44.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:50.987]  Well, it was Roger Stone that broke Stefan Halperin and the other mole and now the latest mole.
[00:48:50.987 --> 00:48:59.275]  And the media, even though he broke it, even though he told the Washington Post on Friday and told us on Friday, but we had to hold it till Sunday as part of an agreement with the Washington Post.
[00:48:59.275 --> 00:49:00.636]  So we simultaneously broke it.
[00:49:00.636 --> 00:49:01.717]  We were 30 minutes before them.
[00:49:02.538 --> 00:49:04.039]  It was 7 a.m.
[00:49:04.039 --> 00:49:06.420]  Eastern was the time we were able to break it.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:28.069]  And there's his statement, but no one picked it up at DrudgeReport.com that, no, this is someone using a Western-style name, not saying they're a Russian background, coming and saying, we have dirt on Hillary, that's totally normal in a campaign to do opposition research, and then spinning it that somehow, oh, see, it's an undisclosed person, now that we know that they're going to bring him up and say, oh, he has Russian ties when Stone
[00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:31.031]  And Caputo did not know about the Russia ties.
[00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:41.261]  But regardless, it changes the subject from here they are trying to plant more moles, potential moles inside of the camp to create those connections to Russia that don't exist.
[00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:48.268]  And then counterterrorism expert, author, researcher, former Navy SEAL Matt Bracken is going to add his analysis to this as well.
[00:49:48.268 --> 00:49:49.509]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[00:49:49.509 --> 00:49:52.232]  So Roger, I tell you, this is getting incredible.
[00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:57.192]  Well, the more we dig into it, the more incredible it is, Alex.
[00:49:57.192 --> 00:50:15.462]  In May of 2016, this is prior to Hillary raising the whole phony Russia issue, my associate Michael Caputo, who's appeared here numerous times at InfoWars, was approached by a man who said he had valuable information for the Trump campaign.
[00:50:16.122 --> 00:50:21.947]  Caputo asked me to meet with the man who, at that point, called himself Henry Greenberg.
[00:50:21.947 --> 00:50:24.990]  As we now know, that was an alias.
[00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:31.015]  And if you go to democratdossier.org, you can see his real background.
[00:50:31.015 --> 00:50:40.303]  He is a 17-year paid informant for the FBI, a Russian national who spent 10 years in prison
[00:50:40.623 --> 00:50:43.884]  And by the way, that's all come out in the investigation.
[00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:16.595]  You know, I saw an excellent headline that describes all this, that out of town hall, as I said Friday, overall it's a whitewash but admits bombshells.
[00:51:16.595 --> 00:51:20.016]  They say nobody did anything wrong, then they actually admit all the crimes in it.
[00:51:20.016 --> 00:51:22.437]  This is all confirmed what you've been saying all along.
[00:51:23.715 --> 00:51:28.939]  Well, the mainstream media likes to go back to the fact that I didn't recall this meeting.
[00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:30.120]  I didn't recall it.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:37.626]  Caputo didn't recall it until Robert Mueller's investigators asked him all about it and they knew all about it.
[00:51:37.626 --> 00:51:39.387]  How coincidental.
[00:51:39.387 --> 00:51:45.672]  Interestingly enough, they also had a text message between Caputo and myself in which he asked me
[00:51:46.272 --> 00:51:50.296]  How the meeting went and I told him it was a waste of time.
[00:51:50.296 --> 00:51:51.196]  But it's interesting.
[00:51:51.196 --> 00:52:03.407]  How did they get that text message if not through an illegal FISA warrant spying on me because I'm a 30 plus year associate of Donald Trump's?
[00:52:03.407 --> 00:52:06.169]  The whole thing stinks of a setup.
[00:52:06.169 --> 00:52:10.033]  The mainstream media wants to focus on why I didn't remember an innocuous
[00:52:10.834 --> 00:52:18.201]  20 minute meeting in which nothing inappropriate happened other than my flatly rejecting this effort to entrap us.
[00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:22.966]  Obviously, had Trump paid for this information, he would have been compromised.
[00:52:22.966 --> 00:52:26.430]  And I think that was the purpose of the actual meeting.
[00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.452]  And they sure, sure tried absolutely hard.
[00:52:29.452 --> 00:52:32.634]  I notice even the Washington Post and places, they talk about this guy.
[00:52:32.634 --> 00:52:34.956]  They go, yeah, he worked for the FBI for 16 years.
[00:52:34.956 --> 00:52:36.237]  Yeah, he's got a criminal background.
[00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:37.678]  OK, big deal.
[00:52:37.678 --> 00:52:40.260]  Oh, but, you know, Stone doesn't really know they sent them.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.621]  We have the documents.
[00:52:41.621 --> 00:52:43.783]  We have the emails.
[00:52:43.783 --> 00:52:51.629]  We have the admissions of people covering up for Hillary and real Russian collusion and all this other collusion with China and then trying to project that on you.
[00:52:51.629 --> 00:52:54.491]  They covered up Spygate, illegal spying on you guys.
[00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:59.637]  With the whole new Russiagate, where is Russiagate now at this point?
[00:52:59.637 --> 00:53:03.742]  I mean, I know it's falling apart, but at the same time, they just keep moving forward.
[00:53:03.742 --> 00:53:11.072]  And the top search term yesterday and today is Roger Stone Trump, as this is the top story, going, oh my God, we got him on Joy Behar!
[00:53:11.072 --> 00:53:11.172]  Yay!
[00:53:12.654 --> 00:53:17.378]  General Flynn says they're all Russian agents, Trump's going to hell, we're bringing the economy down, yip yip!
[00:53:17.378 --> 00:53:19.159]  And of course, none of it was true.
[00:53:19.159 --> 00:53:33.732]  So they just keep running the hoax when you're the one going public with the Washington Post saying, hey they keep asking me about a guy that I had a five minute meeting with, one of thousands of meetings, that was, didn't even really say he was a Russian, he's got this anglicized sounding name, and then, it's just incredible!
[00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:41.398]  It's like they take something, they take something, where it's a point against them, and then they act like it's something we've done.
[00:53:42.455 --> 00:53:43.815]  No, exactly right.
[00:53:43.815 --> 00:53:49.317]  They make a great deal of the fact that I honestly just didn't recall this meeting because it was so ludicrous.
[00:53:49.317 --> 00:54:02.541]  Not only does this guy show up wearing a MAGA hat, a Trump t-shirt, he shows me on his phone photographs of himself and a woman, his wife, his girlfriend, I don't know, at various Trump rallies.
[00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:11.103]  He's obviously trying to persuade me that he just wants to help Trump and then he says he wants two million dollars for unspecified information.
[00:54:11.463 --> 00:54:15.167]  Doesn't say that it's emails, by the way.
[00:54:15.167 --> 00:54:18.450]  The whole thing reeks of an FBI cover-up.
[00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:25.537]  How is he in the country at all, given his record for gun violence in the USSR?
[00:54:25.537 --> 00:54:32.244]  Roger, these people have so much intelligence on us that I'm there with like Navy SEALs who are off-duty, one of them a
[00:54:32.404 --> 00:54:36.870]  A major leader in the underwater submarine operations, really secretive stuff.
[00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.075]  He didn't give me the info, but I know who he is and talk to folks.
[00:54:40.075 --> 00:54:42.878]  The point is, they come over to our table the night of the inauguration.
[00:54:44.022 --> 00:54:53.627]  And we later learn and track all this and start saying, I want to buy submarine technology and I want you to meet with a representative of Taiwan.
[00:54:53.627 --> 00:54:54.867]  They're patriots.
[00:54:54.867 --> 00:54:59.850]  And the Navy SEAL guys are like, whoa, because no one even knew that they were in super secret submarine operations.
[00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:00.830]  But these people did.
[00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:09.595]  And then later we learned they posted photos at strategic places of us at that meeting online to start an investigation on me and those Navy SEALs.
[00:55:09.595 --> 00:55:09.955]  And yes,
[00:55:12.552 --> 00:55:22.777]  Well, and really, let me address the most important question.
[00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:26.939]  These illegal FISO warrants are their Achilles heel.
[00:55:26.939 --> 00:55:36.043]  They refuse to admit in the Manafort matter that he was ever under surveillance in the discovery, even though he's legally entitled to the evidence against him.
[00:55:36.563 --> 00:55:44.368]  The Rod Rosenstein and the Justice Department is stonewalling the House Intelligence Committee in their demands for this information.
[00:55:44.368 --> 00:55:54.275]  The fact that they have the text messages between Caputo and I, I believe those are the fruits of an illegal FISA warrant, as reported by the New York Times on January 20th.
[00:55:54.275 --> 00:55:54.975]  That's right, stay there.
[00:55:54.975 --> 00:55:56.936]  We're going to come back with more of this just briefly.
[00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:57.777]  I'm bringing Matt Bracken up.
[00:55:58.457 --> 00:56:04.921]  I'm not even plugging this hour except free shipping is still here today and all the big specials today because I've been so busy I haven't done new specials.
[00:56:04.921 --> 00:56:08.583]  Even though X2 and Rainforest are about to sell out, they're still 50% off.
[00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:14.706]  Folks, if you want to support the broadcast, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:14.706 --> 00:56:15.486]  Please pray for us.
[00:56:15.486 --> 00:56:16.647]  Spread the live links.
[00:56:16.647 --> 00:56:18.048]  We are tomorrow's news today as well.
[00:56:18.048 --> 00:56:19.048]  We're under attack.
[00:56:19.048 --> 00:56:21.469]  Matt Bracken only brought up the Navy SEAL story.
[00:56:21.469 --> 00:56:22.730]  You're a former Navy SEAL.
[00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:23.110]  They know
[00:56:24.671 --> 00:56:37.997]  When I've got security, or they even know on the day who I'm with, with people I've only been with for two days, trying to get me to do something illegal, or trying to get my associates, I mean, they are on our butts trying to plant something.
[00:56:39.005 --> 00:56:46.592]  Well, remember, they can listen to your phones 24-7 unless you, you know, take the battery out or stick it in an ammo can or something.
[00:56:46.592 --> 00:56:49.635]  So, your phone is an eavesdropping device and a geotracker.
[00:56:49.635 --> 00:56:55.701]  So, I mean, every time you use a credit card, it pings at their headquarters.
[00:56:55.701 --> 00:56:59.264]  So, if they want to follow you and know what you're talking about, who you're with, they know.
[00:56:59.264 --> 00:57:04.149]  You know, it's something that, this is something that Roger mentioned this morning on Laura Ingram.
[00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:05.824]  This is similar.
[00:57:05.824 --> 00:57:17.009]  The Greenberg setup is similar to the Trump Tower meeting in that the Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya, she needed a special State Department visa to get into the USA.
[00:57:17.009 --> 00:57:23.392]  Then she meets Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS before and after the Trump Tower meeting.
[00:57:23.392 --> 00:57:25.193]  So, I mean, this is clearly another setup.
[00:57:25.931 --> 00:57:29.412]  It's all part of the same insurance policy.
[00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:32.213]  Let's talk about this deep state war, Matt, and with Roger.
[00:57:32.213 --> 00:57:33.713]  We come back in just two minutes.
[00:57:33.713 --> 00:57:34.553]  What's their next move?
[00:57:34.553 --> 00:57:38.494]  You predicted a lot of their moves accurately, Matt Bracken, counterterrorism expert.
[00:57:38.494 --> 00:57:40.475]  Of course, we've got Roger at the center of this.
[00:57:40.475 --> 00:57:42.435]  What does he expect is coming next?
[00:57:42.435 --> 00:57:46.736]  We know, as he said a few weeks ago, they're zeroing in on Roger Stone and me!
[00:57:46.736 --> 00:57:48.357]  About 25% of the time spent on Alex Jones.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:59.082]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.082 --> 00:58:06.966]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.966 --> 00:58:10.107]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:10.307 --> 00:58:15.570]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.352]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:58:18.352 --> 00:58:27.318]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:58:27.398 --> 00:58:32.240]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:57.708 --> 00:59:01.510]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:10.236]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.236 --> 00:59:14.799]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:16.260]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.782]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.462 --> 00:59:31.849]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:39.815]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.815 --> 00:59:46.879]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:49.621]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.369 --> 00:59:55.963]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.171]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here.
[01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:28.495]  I was talking to Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, counterterrorism expert, and Roger Stone during the break about why I was bringing up the Navy SEAL story.
[01:00:29.457 --> 01:00:36.142]  About guys I was with, I'm just going to leave it at that, and some other folks there at the inauguration, some of the things we were doing.
[01:00:36.142 --> 01:00:52.134]  Just two days into it, they already had people on us that knew classified backgrounds on people we were with and were actually striking up conversations with them on the street and in bars to try to get a meeting or get us to say something so that they could then, bracket, explain to them what they're doing.
[01:00:52.974 --> 01:00:54.955]  And I'm not trying to insert myself in this story.
[01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:55.655]  I'm in the story.
[01:00:55.655 --> 01:00:59.057]  25% of the time Caputo said, the FBI brought me up.
[01:00:59.057 --> 01:01:01.818]  Rogers talked to a dozen other people or more that say the same thing.
[01:01:01.818 --> 01:01:04.580]  They're now trying to act like me and Stone are masterminding.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.901]  But the point you made during the break was key.
[01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:08.221]  Please make that.
[01:01:08.221 --> 01:01:08.661]  Right.
[01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:11.423]  This is a full-spectrum intel operation.
[01:01:11.423 --> 01:01:20.687]  The tactics and the techniques that they learned, that the CIA and others learned and used during the Cold War and the War on Terror against legitimate foreign enemies,
[01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:25.421]  They've now brought home and have turned against domestic opposition.
[01:01:25.421 --> 01:01:28.484]  It's just, the point of having the meeting is just to have the meeting.
[01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:29.765]  Like the Trump Tower meeting.
[01:01:29.765 --> 01:01:31.667]  Doesn't matter what they talked about.
[01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:41.536]  The fact that a compromised or guilty-looking Russian lawyer is in the same room, you know, with Donald Jr.
[01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:43.778]  for two minutes or whatever, that's the goal.
[01:01:44.959 --> 01:01:51.445]  Or meeting Stefan Halper, or meeting the Alexander Downer in London.
[01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:58.151]  If you have the meeting, it can then be leaked to the media as a guilty meeting, proof of collusion.
[01:01:58.151 --> 01:02:00.833]  So this is actually going to blow up on them because the...
[01:02:02.194 --> 01:02:07.879]  You know, using this guy Greenberg, whatever his real name is, the Russian, it's so clumsy.
[01:02:07.879 --> 01:02:09.961]  A Trump hat, Trump t-shirt.
[01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:12.243]  It's such a clumsy method of entrapment.
[01:02:12.243 --> 01:02:13.444]  They obviously dropped it.
[01:02:13.444 --> 01:02:19.910]  His handlers, his FBI handlers, after the meeting said, well, forget this, it's going nowhere.
[01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.471]  Roger Stone didn't bite.
[01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.973]  But what it did was it established the pattern.
[01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:28.097]  This is part of Strzok's insurance policy that he discussed in his emails.
[01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:28.899]  Roger.
[01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:31.607]  And this is where it's going to really blow up though.
[01:02:31.607 --> 01:02:32.169]  Just a second.
[01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:39.492]  Strzok is an old friend of Rudy Contreras, judge on the FISA Court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[01:02:39.492 --> 01:02:59.319]  This is why the DOJ has been going to the mattresses, risking impeachment, risking contempt of Congress, because when it comes out that Strzok didn't need any help at FISA Court, he could have put a blank sheet of paper in that the FISA Court is also corrupt, then this scandal blows up supernova.
[01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.065]  I mean, I think you just knocked it out of the park there.
[01:03:03.065 --> 01:03:04.146]  I mean, that's absolutely right.
[01:03:04.146 --> 01:03:09.308]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but man, that's huge, what Matt Bracken just talked about.
[01:03:09.308 --> 01:03:10.649]  Roger?
[01:03:10.649 --> 01:03:13.050]  No, I think Matt just nailed it.
[01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.952]  The FISA warrants are their Achilles heel.
[01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.388]  They are at the centerpiece of the Manafort case.
[01:03:19.388 --> 01:03:26.050]  They're at the centerpiece of their effort to frame me for some bogus offense to silence me.
[01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:31.172]  I'm being persecuted because I supported Donald Trump and for no other reason.
[01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:33.673]  I've committed no crime and they know that.
[01:03:33.673 --> 01:03:36.014]  So they go out and try to manufacture one.
[01:03:37.054 --> 01:03:48.078]  This is going to be a complete struggle and it appears that Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy and now even Paul Ryan have laid down the gauntlet for DOJ.
[01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:57.762]  Turn over the information regarding the FISA warrants and who was being spied on or face an insurrection in the Congress.
[01:03:57.762 --> 01:04:01.123]  Didn't we see with that report that got no attention last year when we come back we'll talk about this?
[01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:10.232]  Where the FISA court overseers put out a report saying they've been lied to and that they've been given info that wasn't true and improper warrants.
[01:04:10.232 --> 01:04:15.178]  I mean, I think that's the FISA court preemptively trying to cover their butt way ahead of time, Matt.
[01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.486]  Yeah, but that went away.
[01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:25.432]  That turned very quiet when it turned out that Peter Strzok is a pre-existing friend and a close friend of Judge Rudy Contreras.
[01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:35.619]  There's a redacted text where it says, blank, and it's presumed to be Contreras, wants us to have a meeting, but we need to bring some other people for cover for action.
[01:04:35.619 --> 01:04:42.524]  That's a tradecraft term showing guilty knowledge that this meeting would be completely guilty.
[01:04:42.524 --> 01:04:45.727]  So cover for action in that text message is damning.
[01:04:46.227 --> 01:04:48.088]  I don't know why people haven't picked up on that one.
[01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:49.589]  It's huge.
[01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:54.833]  I'm telling you folks, everybody's sick of Russiagate, so am I. But Russiagate spygates and brings them down.
[01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:56.514]  The deep state's going down!
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:18.235]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:20.336]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.336 --> 01:05:24.339]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.339 --> 01:05:25.360]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:31.564]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.564 --> 01:05:33.966]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.966 --> 01:05:39.389]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:41.891]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:51.077]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:55.520]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:09.446 --> 01:06:12.228]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:27.836 --> 01:06:40.738]  Alright, this segment with Roger Stone and Matt Bracken, I want to get more into Russiagate, that's really a cover for Spygate, and what the Inspector General report shows, and what they think Mueller of the Deep State is going to do next.
[01:06:40.738 --> 01:06:53.861]  When I told the story about, you know, people trying to get me when I'm with Navy SEALs to sell them submarine technology, it's not about me, it's about they're going around in a full spectrum intelligence operation that Bracken talked about,
[01:06:55.444 --> 01:07:00.127]  Trying to get us is to joke around about something illegal.
[01:07:00.127 --> 01:07:03.689]  And, this is how they then open up investigations, this is how they leak things.
[01:07:03.689 --> 01:07:07.751]  Matt Bracken was getting into that earlier.
[01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:10.452]  But now, what does it mean?
[01:07:10.452 --> 01:07:17.637]  This is a selfish question, Roger Schoen and then Matt Bracken jump in, and then recap what you were saying earlier, that's so huge about Strzok's connection to the FISA court judge.
[01:07:17.637 --> 01:07:20.578]  That's amazing, we want to elaborate on that more.
[01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:23.360]  But what does it symbolize, Stone and Bracken,
[01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:45.251]  of how desperate they are, you know, the deep state Clinton stay-behind networks that are still in there but being exposed, that I'm 25% of the time in the questions for Caputo, who's been on the show and talks about it, and others, getting into what we do, where we go, what we eat, Trump's sex life, our sex life.
[01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:49.714]  I mean, because I know I'm not connected to Russia, and I know they know that.
[01:07:49.714 --> 01:07:50.594]  That is insane.
[01:07:50.594 --> 01:07:53.896]  So what does that say as they tighten the noose down
[01:07:54.816 --> 01:07:59.378]  Well Alex, today at 2 o'clock in front of the Chief Judge there's a hearing over an attempt
[01:08:14.443 --> 01:08:18.507]  To subpoena a man who once worked for me named Andrew Miller.
[01:08:18.507 --> 01:08:24.752]  Andrew Miller was my right-hand man for a number of years, and the FBI showed up at his St.
[01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:32.419]  Louis home roughly two weeks ago to question him extensively about my relationship with Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.944 --> 01:08:39.128]  Now, his lawyer is resisting an attempt to drag him in front of the grand jury to testify.
[01:08:39.128 --> 01:08:43.031]  He did not work for me during the 2016 campaign.
[01:08:43.031 --> 01:08:53.358]  He has no knowledge of the Trump campaign support or the Trump efforts that I made independently, but they are struggling to bring him in front of a grand jury.
[01:08:53.798 --> 01:08:58.821]  Why are they asking questions about my relationship with InfoWars and Alex Jones?
[01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:00.923]  Why are you being targeted?
[01:09:00.923 --> 01:09:03.224]  Why do they want to silence us?
[01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:09.108]  Why are they moving to the Chief Judge and attempt to force this young man to testify?
[01:09:09.108 --> 01:09:12.750]  It's outrageous, but I think it shows you where they want to go.
[01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:22.616]  They're going to seek to frame me, and perhaps you, in some bogus crime that does not exist because they want to silence InfoWars.
[01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:32.580]  Because we're the cutting edge, we're the tip of the spear, and we hurt them every day by bringing people like Matt Bracken on to tell people what is really happening.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.881]  Exactly, and it's not Alex Jones, it's the platform.
[01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:46.886]  But it is surreal to then, dozens of people, some have told me on air, some in private, yeah they just keep obsessing with you and how you're a mastermind and you work with Trump and that's not really true.
[01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:50.688]  I mean, the President said, I like what you're doing, press the attack, keep it up, I'm not going to let you down.
[01:09:51.628 --> 01:09:52.388]  Don't let me down.
[01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.288]  I mean, that's it.
[01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:53.989]  He's the president.
[01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.269]  I'm allowed to talk to the president.
[01:09:55.269 --> 01:10:03.851]  You know, they act like it's a bad thing that, uh, you know, some of these folks are like in naval intelligence, but then it's private, uh, like Jack Posobiec.
[01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:05.851]  And they go, he has to be kicked out of the Navy.
[01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:08.532]  You can't have someone in intelligence talking to the president.
[01:10:08.532 --> 01:10:12.072]  I mean, this idea that Americans can't communicate and try to bring the country back.
[01:10:12.072 --> 01:10:13.593]  Matt Bracken, what do you make of all this?
[01:10:13.593 --> 01:10:16.353]  And what do you think's coming next?
[01:10:16.353 --> 01:10:20.454]  The larger picture, the, uh, you know, the sky camera view is,
[01:10:21.329 --> 01:10:23.831]  About controlling the narratives.
[01:10:23.831 --> 01:10:30.355]  And you can see this whether it was Fast and Furious, which was sold as 90% of the guns in Mexican crimes.
[01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:34.038]  Complete, you know, operation, a deadly operation.
[01:10:34.038 --> 01:10:36.320]  The Benghazi video false narrative.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.422]  What we're seeing is an effort to control the narrative.
[01:10:40.015 --> 01:10:50.120]  If they can restrict it, say, to Fox News and have people just say, oh, the only place that's been reported is on Hannity and he's a kook, well, InfoWars is cutting edge.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:57.744]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear, like you said, and it's a question of discrediting InfoWars, eventually taking it down.
[01:10:57.744 --> 01:11:03.807]  But if they can't take it off the air, they want to discredit it so that anything that comes out of here is tainted.
[01:11:03.807 --> 01:11:04.487]  That's why, you know,
[01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:20.751]  It's very rare for a guy like Jack Basovic, he can be on, or Tony Schafer, Colonel Tony Schafer, Roger Stone, I could probably on one hand name the people that have appeared on InfoWars that are also allowed inside the Fox building, they'll never be anywhere else.
[01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:29.814]  So, if they can contain this leading edge of information to what they want to portray as kook world, that's part of discrediting.
[01:11:30.014 --> 01:11:41.615]  Matt, that is the smartest thing you've ever said, because if you read Media Matters and The Globalist, they keep saying, Jones, and my guess, that's you, continue to be patient zero, they see us as a disease, Stelter calls us a disease, that must be eradicated.
[01:11:42.412 --> 01:11:45.194]  And then Tucker Carlson says don't trust CNN.
[01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:46.856]  They go, how dare you hurt democracy?
[01:11:46.856 --> 01:11:48.357]  They want to take us off the air.
[01:11:48.357 --> 01:11:49.979]  We're just saying they're liars.
[01:11:49.979 --> 01:11:50.659]  But that's it.
[01:11:50.659 --> 01:11:59.407]  They say we must shut down InfoWars because time and time again it creates the countervailing narrative that the public believes instead of theirs because our narrative's true.
[01:11:59.407 --> 01:12:00.167]  But that's it.
[01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:03.810]  They just don't like that they keep seeing the narrative come out of InfoWars.
[01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:04.051]  Go ahead.
[01:12:04.971 --> 01:12:15.357]  Meanwhile, you've got Murrell, who was the Deputy CIA during the flap where Benghazi was fired.
[01:12:15.357 --> 01:12:16.957]  He's a stooge for the Deep State.
[01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:19.459]  He goes to work, I think, for CBS.
[01:12:19.459 --> 01:12:27.843]  You've got Clapper, Brennan, now Hayden's coming out calling Trump a Nazi, putting up a picture of Auschwitz over these things.
[01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:33.508]  So you've got the deep state heavyweights, Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, they're going to the mattress.
[01:12:33.508 --> 01:12:35.229]  This is do or die.
[01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:45.878]  If it turns out that Strzok, you know, off-duty contacted Contreras of the FISA court and that the original warrants are going to look damningly guilty,
[01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:50.312]  This is going to be impossible for them to contain.
[01:12:50.312 --> 01:12:53.393]  So this week could be like, you know, major tectonic plates.
[01:12:53.393 --> 01:12:53.853]  No, I agree.
[01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:55.134]  They've committed so many crimes.
[01:12:55.134 --> 01:13:01.256]  If you look at that arrogant little elf Hayden and all of them, they look really scared for the first time.
[01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:02.496]  Obama looks scared.
[01:13:02.496 --> 01:13:03.336]  Hillary looks scared.
[01:13:03.336 --> 01:13:04.057]  Trump's winning.
[01:13:04.057 --> 01:13:04.597]  We're winning.
[01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:05.357]  Roger, what do you say?
[01:13:06.602 --> 01:13:18.670]  I think you're exactly right, yet at the same time I have to deal with this effort to crank up and frame me for some crime, which is why I must ask people to go to stonedefensefund.com.
[01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:23.974]  Mueller is gunning for me, and Alex, I think he's gunning for you, and we have to be prepared.
[01:13:23.974 --> 01:13:27.256]  This is going to cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:31.238]  Everybody says they want to take America back and they want to fight the globalists.
[01:13:31.238 --> 01:13:32.798]  We are front line.
[01:13:32.798 --> 01:13:35.679]  We are their main enemy because we don't pull punches.
[01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:40.461]  And absolutely, if we don't get massive funding, we won't be able to do the expansion.
[01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:43.562]  And then they're going to start winning and pushing us backward.
[01:13:43.562 --> 01:13:47.243]  They have to see us win in court, which we're starting to do, and expand.
[01:13:47.543 --> 01:13:50.524]  I'm very close to having the next cruise ready to launch a bunch of new shows.
[01:13:50.524 --> 01:13:52.845]  Talking to Matt Bracken about that in the next week, Matt.
[01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.866]  And then find out, because I've got to get a bunch of people together on this.
[01:13:54.866 --> 01:13:57.327]  And we've got the satellites, TV stations picking us up.
[01:13:57.327 --> 01:13:59.107]  They know we're winning.
[01:13:59.107 --> 01:14:05.830]  They know we've got a model like Sinclair to go to local TV stations, and it's already happening and having more success than I even thought it would.
[01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.991]  And that's why they are going into conniption fits.
[01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:09.571]  Yeah.
[01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:13.914]  We sold a lot of product over the weekend, but it's already 50% discounted, so it doesn't really fund us a lot.
[01:14:13.914 --> 01:14:18.277]  We had some moderate donations, but, you know, people like to buy the products that are donations.
[01:14:18.277 --> 01:14:26.101]  If you ever wanted to be in the fight against the globalists, then you need to go to InfoWars.com and you need to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:26.101 --> 01:14:29.643]  There's a link there to donate.
[01:14:29.643 --> 01:14:34.726]  You need to go to Roger Stone's Defense Fund, but InfoWars.com forward slash donate.
[01:14:34.726 --> 01:14:35.347]  Jones Legal.
[01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:40.671]  Alex Jones, can we put that back up, just freeze that for me, because I don't have it in my sheet here, thanks.
[01:14:40.671 --> 01:14:47.095]  AlexJonesLegalFund.com, AlexJonesDefenseFund.com, and make a major donation.
[01:14:47.095 --> 01:14:50.537]  If you can afford it, make a big donation, or if you only can afford $10.
[01:14:50.537 --> 01:14:55.461]  The point is, we are in the gun sights because we're changing the country and changing the world.
[01:14:55.461 --> 01:14:56.582]  Go get a bunch of products.
[01:14:56.582 --> 01:14:59.443]  Free shipping was already supposed to end, but I've been too busy, even having a special.
[01:14:59.443 --> 01:15:05.708]  Free shipping's still there, and these giant discounts, 50% off, but those have got to end today, after I get off and down to come up with some new specials.
[01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.509]  They won't be dramatic as this.
[01:15:08.509 --> 01:15:24.700]  I want to do one more segment with you gentlemen and just try to let you guys have the floor, Bracken and then Stone, about what you expect to come next, this whole hoax that Trump's putting children in concentration camps when it's the UN and the Democrats that have all actually been caught doing all this, and where you see this going.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.742]  And I see Trump winning right now, but as you said,
[01:15:28.786 --> 01:15:32.687]  These arrogant, cornered, crazy SOBs aren't going to stop.
[01:15:32.687 --> 01:15:35.068]  So you guys have been really accurate predicting what's going to come next.
[01:15:35.068 --> 01:15:35.728]  We'll hit that.
[01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:44.271]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, we are joined by George Norrie to get his take on all this and so much more.
[01:15:44.271 --> 01:15:45.672]  Show, that's coming up.
[01:15:45.672 --> 01:15:47.792]  And then Ali Alexander is hosting the fourth hour.
[01:15:47.792 --> 01:15:50.973]  I intend to have open phones in the third hour.

[01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:04.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:35.119]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.119 --> 01:20:39.883]  By the end of the broadcast today, right when the war room's kicking off with Ellen Schreuer and Roger Stone...
[01:20:41.064 --> 01:20:44.385]  We're going to have an exclusive analysis.
[01:20:44.385 --> 01:20:46.945]  Believe me, if we weren't exclusive, I'd just post somebody else's article.
[01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:48.826]  I just want the info to get out.
[01:20:48.826 --> 01:21:01.048]  Our crew noticed on page 302 of the 500-page report that mainstream media said totally exonerated the Clintons and the FBI day one, before they'd read it.
[01:21:01.048 --> 01:21:06.850]  Yeah, it said the FBI didn't do anything wrong, according to them, because they're not a judge or jury, but they said, here's the facts.
[01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:07.830]  302, I guess is the name of an FBI
[01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:10.313]  We're good to go.
[01:21:30.566 --> 01:21:34.408]  Well, they took a giant tub of stinking excrement
[01:21:57.918 --> 01:22:03.083]  And then they put in a pink box and put a ribbon on it and said, there's no proof, like there's no confession.
[01:22:03.083 --> 01:22:07.007]  Yes, I, Peter Strzok, did all of this from my bias.
[01:22:07.007 --> 01:22:14.154]  So it's like when, as has been pointed out, it's like when Comey did his indictment followed by exoneration speech.
[01:22:14.754 --> 01:22:18.815]  You know, the excrement is still inside of the pink box.
[01:22:18.815 --> 01:22:26.658]  But I'd like to say something about the FBI and the other federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies.
[01:22:26.658 --> 01:22:30.359]  I keep hearing about that it's only a few bad apples on the seventh floor of the FBI.
[01:22:31.255 --> 01:22:39.118]  If that was so, we'd be seeing whistleblowers, you know, incognito behind a screen with a muffled voice saying what they knew.
[01:22:39.118 --> 01:22:45.720]  The problem is that the FBI and other agencies have been hiring social justice warriors for a generation now.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.481]  I mean, look at Brennan.
[01:22:47.481 --> 01:22:52.282]  He admitted on Polygraph in 1980 that he voted for the communist ticket in 1976.
[01:22:52.282 --> 01:22:54.543]  They said, come on in.
[01:22:54.543 --> 01:22:56.304]  He might as well have had mole on his forehead.
[01:22:56.904 --> 01:22:59.785]  So, don't expect help from the rank-and-file FBI.
[01:22:59.785 --> 01:23:02.365]  They're practically as bad as Strzok.
[01:23:02.365 --> 01:23:11.567]  The old school that we are, our generation that was, you know, raised to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, we're considered dinosaurs.
[01:23:11.567 --> 01:23:11.907]  No, you're right.
[01:23:11.907 --> 01:23:12.967]  That's a major problem.
[01:23:12.967 --> 01:23:20.689]  How do we remove, I mean, like, Reality Winner, who was an ISIS and Al-Qaeda operative, how do we remove these mentally ill SJWs from the government?
[01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:21.649]  I mean, they infest it.
[01:23:22.856 --> 01:23:25.444]  I don't think that we do under the current structure.
[01:23:25.444 --> 01:23:26.627]  They're too deeply embedded.
[01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:29.395]  They won't even get rid of Strzok, like you said!
[01:23:30.999 --> 01:23:37.743]  There's a great article in Front Page Mag today about the corrupt bureaucracy, the federal bureaucracy.
[01:23:37.743 --> 01:23:41.065]  They've been hiring their own ilk now for a generation.
[01:23:41.065 --> 01:23:45.148]  And it putrefies and the filth rises to the top.
[01:23:45.148 --> 01:23:50.751]  You know, that's who they hire and then they filter out the patriots and they reward the traitors.
[01:23:50.751 --> 01:23:54.174]  Just look at these guys like Brennan, Comey, Clapper, Morrell.
[01:23:54.174 --> 01:23:56.535]  They're all on network news lying.
[01:23:56.535 --> 01:23:59.197]  You know, they're complete counter-patriots.
[01:23:59.497 --> 01:24:02.078]  How crazy is how arrogant they are?
[01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:03.258]  Roger Stone, where's this going?
[01:24:03.258 --> 01:24:04.878]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[01:24:04.878 --> 01:24:10.119]  Well, not only are they on network news lying, they're being paid to do it.
[01:24:10.119 --> 01:24:18.061]  Look, this confrontation between the House and the Justice Department is our best hope.
[01:24:18.061 --> 01:24:23.703]  And frankly, Paul Ryan, the Speaker, has had to have been dragged kicking and screaming to the investigation.
[01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:25.263]  Devin Nunes is a hero.
[01:24:26.143 --> 01:24:32.644]  And he has to undergo the slings and arrows of the mainstream media every single day.
[01:24:32.644 --> 01:24:35.925]  Their Achilles heel are the FISA warrants.
[01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:44.427]  We have to fight to uncover what is there because that is what makes the whole dirty cover-up unravel.
[01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:48.027]  The Inspector General's report is a bureaucratic whitewash.
[01:24:48.027 --> 01:24:51.108]  They lay out all the crimes and then they try to excuse them.
[01:24:51.728 --> 01:24:55.809]  That performance by the FBI director, Ray, was embarrassing.
[01:24:55.809 --> 01:24:56.910]  He admitted to nothing.
[01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:58.970]  We're going to have sensitivity training.
[01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:00.991]  There was no political bias.
[01:25:00.991 --> 01:25:02.511]  There are no crimes here, folks.
[01:25:02.511 --> 01:25:04.292]  Just keep moving.
[01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:07.073]  He is not the man to clean up the FBI.
[01:25:07.073 --> 01:25:09.473]  The president commends him in a tweet.
[01:25:09.473 --> 01:25:11.254]  I don't see how he can.
[01:25:11.254 --> 01:25:14.035]  Why doesn't the FBI director clean house?
[01:25:14.035 --> 01:25:14.895]  He won't.
[01:25:14.895 --> 01:25:18.996]  The house cleaning at the FBI needs to begin with the new director.
[01:25:18.996 --> 01:25:21.217]  He is part and parcel of the deep state.
[01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:28.867]  This is something that Gowdy and Nunez said over the weekend.
[01:25:28.867 --> 01:25:35.649]  Maria Bartiromo's got an outstanding segment with Devin Nunez from Sunday morning with Maria Bartiromo.
[01:25:35.649 --> 01:25:43.992]  But both Nunez and Gowdy now say to Ray and Rosenstein, do you want to be part of the cover-up team or the clean-up team?
[01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:51.398]  And what I think he's saying is, you're going to go down with the rats on the sinking ship if you try to maintain this cover-up.
[01:25:51.398 --> 01:25:53.940]  You've got to now pick a side.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.342]  You know, it's like the Berlin Wall.
[01:25:55.342 --> 01:25:57.383]  You've got to jump one way or the other.
[01:25:57.383 --> 01:26:02.908]  You've got to decide if you're on our side, the cleanup team, or the cover-up team.
[01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:08.934]  And when all this FISA stuff is unwrapped, finally, anybody who's been covering it up, they should go to prison.
[01:26:09.634 --> 01:26:20.596]  And by the way, the fact that we see Giuliani saying that Comey should go to prison and this is a criminal cover-up and others should go to prison, that's the mouth of the president saying we're moving in that direction.
[01:26:20.596 --> 01:26:23.157]  And some would say, well, why give them amnesty if they join us?
[01:26:23.157 --> 01:26:29.938]  That's how we win this war quickly, folks, is if we say you're going to get amnesty, just come over now, you know we're winning, and that's the truth.
[01:26:29.938 --> 01:26:35.959]  And I think a lot of these rats should realize they're not going to keep their job, but they're not going to go to prison.
[01:26:35.959 --> 01:26:37.280]  They need to get out of the way.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.500]  That's a smart move, isn't it, Matt?
[01:26:39.266 --> 01:26:44.209]  That's why Strzok is saying he'll testify in Congress without an offer of immunity.
[01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:52.775]  Because Strzok, the only way out for Strzok now, after all of his text messages, is to say, I was just following orders.
[01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:53.976]  Remember the text messages?
[01:26:53.976 --> 01:26:56.337]  So that's a major point that he's getting ready to roll on.
[01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:58.099]  Do you agree with that, Roger?
[01:26:58.099 --> 01:27:01.381]  I really do, because at the end of the day, the real question here is,
[01:27:02.111 --> 01:27:04.992]  What did Obama know, and when did he know it?
[01:27:04.992 --> 01:27:09.033]  Strzok says in his text messages the President wants to know everything.
[01:27:09.033 --> 01:27:16.875]  Susan Rice writes a CYA memo for the file that kind of gives you the game.
[01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:20.336]  Barack Obama is the head of the rotted fish.
[01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.997]  He is running and approving this entire... That's right.
[01:27:22.997 --> 01:27:27.439]  At the end of the day, he's doing it for Hillary and the Democrats, and that's why he's been laying low.
[01:27:27.439 --> 01:27:28.399]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:29.548 --> 01:27:33.850]  Veselnitskaya, the attorney, got the special visa through the State Department.
[01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:35.791]  That's not Strzok at the FBI.
[01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:37.212]  That's State Department.
[01:27:37.212 --> 01:27:41.494]  Where do State Department, CIA, FBI, where do they all meet?
[01:27:41.494 --> 01:27:42.615]  Only one place.
[01:27:42.615 --> 01:27:43.195]  White House.
[01:27:43.195 --> 01:27:43.916]  That's right.
[01:27:43.916 --> 01:27:52.260]  Well, we knew this, you said this a year and a half ago, Roger, that sources and intel that this was Samantha Powers, all of them, they're just all in there with the NSA, all of them.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.801]  That's why these crooks are all so scared.
[01:27:54.961 --> 01:28:02.109]  All roads lead to Barack Obama as the master criminal who was trying to wire things for Hillary.
[01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:09.516]  The reason they were so arrogant in their text messages, in their emails, in their actions, it was because they were so certain she would win.
[01:28:09.516 --> 01:28:10.758]  They were calling her the president!
[01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:12.745]  Exactly.
[01:28:12.745 --> 01:28:13.545]  Exactly.
[01:28:13.545 --> 01:28:15.926]  Alright.
[01:28:15.926 --> 01:28:18.207]  Mike Rogers of the NSA will be the big white hat.
[01:28:18.207 --> 01:28:22.169]  When he testifies, he'll be the Ollie North times a thousand.
[01:28:22.169 --> 01:28:22.549]  That's right.
[01:28:22.549 --> 01:28:27.051]  He's the one that when the president was president-elect, he ran over there and spilled the beans to the president.
[01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:29.952]  Thank God.
[01:28:29.952 --> 01:28:31.433]  Thank God for Rogers.
[01:28:31.433 --> 01:28:31.993]  God.
[01:28:31.993 --> 01:28:32.513]  God.
[01:28:32.513 --> 01:28:34.094]  Oh, we'd be in so much trouble if it wasn't for that.
[01:28:34.873 --> 01:28:35.974]  Okay, thank you gentlemen.

[01:33:00.762 --> 01:33:03.426]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.226 --> 01:33:25.187]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:25.187 --> 01:33:33.390]  We're going to have open phones and a ton of news and a bunch of clips and more of the president's speech today about this whole hoax that he's putting kids in concentration camps.
[01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:37.632]  You know, we've documented real FEMA emergency centers for societal collapse.
[01:33:37.632 --> 01:33:42.114]  We've documented congressional hearings on plans to put political dissidents in facilities.
[01:33:42.114 --> 01:33:45.776]  I mean, I've got the documents, the executive orders, I've made films.
[01:33:45.776 --> 01:33:51.338]  I investigated FEMA camps and most of the ones people said were FEMA camps were immigrant centers.
[01:33:52.731 --> 01:33:55.012]  And some of them had kids on them.
[01:33:55.012 --> 01:33:58.134]  I've been involved in national TV shows with those.
[01:33:58.134 --> 01:33:59.034]  With Jesse Ventura.
[01:33:59.034 --> 01:34:03.977]  And we discovered it's where they kept kids.
[01:34:03.977 --> 01:34:05.238]  And Obama did it.
[01:34:05.238 --> 01:34:07.139]  And Trump's been trying to change the law.
[01:34:07.139 --> 01:34:08.680]  But what do you do with a family?
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.141]  You don't put them in general population.
[01:34:11.141 --> 01:34:13.442]  Kids with a bunch of other adults.
[01:34:13.442 --> 01:34:15.784]  So they are certainly spinning all of that.
[01:34:15.784 --> 01:34:17.284]  We'll get George Norie's take on that.
[01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.466]  George Norie's take on the world in general.
[01:34:20.543 --> 01:34:25.806]  Here in just a moment, I've been wanting to get George on for a while, and then I had an idea.
[01:34:25.806 --> 01:34:28.067]  I thought, why not twist his arm to come on the show?
[01:34:28.067 --> 01:34:28.667]  He's a busy guy.
[01:34:28.667 --> 01:34:32.990]  He's up at night with his, you could argue, the top radio show in the world.
[01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:35.231]  It's definitely in the top two.
[01:34:35.231 --> 01:34:37.292]  And of course, that's Coast to Coast AM with George Norris.
[01:34:37.292 --> 01:34:40.854]  We're going to be going to him here in just a moment to cover that and the waterfront.
[01:34:40.854 --> 01:34:44.356]  But before we go any further,
[01:34:46.617 --> 01:34:49.578]  Please don't forget this broadcast is funded by you.
[01:34:49.578 --> 01:34:56.463]  The Radio Network has its ads and I've got some ads I run on the air, but we mainly sell our own products to fund ourselves.
[01:34:57.894 --> 01:35:01.875]  And this is the final day, because I've been so busy, I haven't come up with new specials.
[01:35:01.875 --> 01:35:10.759]  Free shipping on all our best-selling items, and 50% off on Brain Force, the real Red Pill Plus, Super Mel Vitality, X2, even though the supply of that is very, very low.
[01:35:10.759 --> 01:35:13.860]  If you haven't tried Brain Force or X2, those two alone, they're amazing.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:19.061]  But we've got Prostagarb, we've got Lung Cleanse, these are real game-changers.
[01:35:19.061 --> 01:35:23.523]  Great books, great films, great t-shirts, great water filtration, excellent air filtration.
[01:35:25.759 --> 01:35:31.884]  Whatever the best systems are, and the things that I personally use, we order it and then sell it at a discount.
[01:35:31.884 --> 01:35:33.826]  Take Knockout.
[01:35:33.826 --> 01:35:36.448]  On average, it's 19 bucks for a bottle of melatonin.
[01:35:36.448 --> 01:35:39.671]  I found out how much good melatonin is, about a dollar per bottle.
[01:35:39.671 --> 01:35:42.394]  I said, why are people selling it for 20, 30 bucks?
[01:35:42.394 --> 01:35:47.018]  I said, I like to take L-tryptophan and valerian root and some other stuff at the same time.
[01:35:47.018 --> 01:35:52.643]  That'd be 50, 60 bucks to have all those different pills when I do need help sleeping, which is not that often, but it happens.
[01:35:54.677 --> 01:36:02.006]  And I went and checked with the experts and said it's totally safe to put eight different things together, all the same regular dose for the same price of one.
[01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:06.832]  So eight products in there for the price of one of the products, they sell it to you.
[01:36:06.832 --> 01:36:07.914]  That's the markup they do.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.681]  That's the markup, folks.
[01:36:10.681 --> 01:36:13.263]  They put a dollar a product and then it sold for $19.
[01:36:13.263 --> 01:36:15.005]  Well, I put eight different products in it.
[01:36:15.005 --> 01:36:15.865]  The same normal amount.
[01:36:15.865 --> 01:36:17.507]  It's a big ol' pill.
[01:36:17.507 --> 01:36:18.828]  And then, boom, sell it to you for $19.
[01:36:18.828 --> 01:36:20.669]  It's on sale right now.
[01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:23.672]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.672 --> 01:36:26.134]  Go read the reviews.
[01:36:26.134 --> 01:36:30.978]  I'm not going to go over all these reviews while George is there, but that's how we fund our operations.
[01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:37.962]  Joining us is George Norrie, and of course you hear him coast-to-coast on over 650 radio stations.
[01:36:37.962 --> 01:36:41.084]  He's also on in Europe and Canada and Guam.
[01:36:41.084 --> 01:36:42.164]  He's one of the only U.S.
[01:36:42.164 --> 01:36:45.106]  shows that's been exported worldwide with great success.
[01:36:45.106 --> 01:36:55.452]  The reason I love George is he was the only guy in 2003, back when InfoWars was pretty big, but not like it is now, that had the guts to put us on here.
[01:36:56.252 --> 01:37:03.855]  And so he's a real trailblazer and everybody else has me on and they get threatened to not have me on and they don't have me on.
[01:37:03.855 --> 01:37:06.897]  Doesn't matter if I go on somebody's show and it's the number one podcast they ever have.
[01:37:06.897 --> 01:37:09.898]  They get told don't do it or iTunes won't promote you and they roll over.
[01:37:09.898 --> 01:37:12.959]  George Norrie went to bat for me and was under a lot of pressure.
[01:37:12.959 --> 01:37:15.420]  But thanks to him, InfoWars has reached out to a lot of folks.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.321]  So I always like to thank George when he comes on.
[01:37:17.321 --> 01:37:20.082]  And I want to get into the passing of the great Art Bell.
[01:37:20.082 --> 01:37:21.223]  I want to get you on about that.
[01:37:21.223 --> 01:37:23.964]  I want to get into the situation going on
[01:37:24.204 --> 01:37:26.985]  Alex, I feel like your big brother.
[01:37:26.985 --> 01:37:27.405]  How are you?
[01:37:51.587 --> 01:37:59.118]  Three times, and I've got the honor and distinction, Alex, that I've been nominated to the National Radio Hall of Fame.
[01:37:59.118 --> 01:38:01.401]  Today's the last day of voting.
[01:38:01.401 --> 01:38:06.048]  Your listeners and viewers can push me to the top if we get this thing done today.
[01:38:06.585 --> 01:38:07.146]  Absolutely.
[01:38:07.146 --> 01:38:13.010]  I mentioned this a few weeks ago and people say, oh, this is how you thank George Norey for everything he's done.
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:15.372]  He deserves to be in the Radio Hall of Fame.
[01:38:15.372 --> 01:38:18.394]  It also means a lot to advertisers and things.
[01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:21.076]  It's really good for George to get this recognition.
[01:38:21.076 --> 01:38:23.938]  And I saw this and wanted to invite him on.
[01:38:23.938 --> 01:38:27.401]  I told him last week and I said, hey, can I get you on to promote that and some other stuff?
[01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:28.402]  Because, you know, he's a busy guy.
[01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:30.503]  He said, yeah, it's important, I guess, you know.
[01:38:30.503 --> 01:38:32.585]  So I asked George to come on to do this.
[01:38:32.585 --> 01:38:33.846]  And how do people do it?
[01:38:33.846 --> 01:38:34.626]  I mean, I've got several
[01:38:35.567 --> 01:38:37.051]  Several ways for them to do it.
[01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:39.356]  It's RadioVote.com.
[01:38:39.356 --> 01:38:40.819]  RadioVote.com.
[01:38:40.819 --> 01:38:42.443]  But they can also text, can't they?
[01:38:42.443 --> 01:38:44.227]  How do people make sure you go to number one?
[01:38:44.998 --> 01:38:46.379]  This is what you do, Alex.
[01:38:46.379 --> 01:38:55.265]  First of all, if you have 90 different cell phones and 15 different email addresses, you can vote 105 times.
[01:38:55.265 --> 01:38:57.166]  They permit that.
[01:38:57.166 --> 01:38:58.547]  So, this is what you do.
[01:38:58.547 --> 01:39:03.290]  In terms of text, everybody grab your phone, send a text message to 96000.
[01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.310]  96000.
[01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:03.370]  96000.
[01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:05.111]  And then in the message,
[01:39:11.395 --> 01:39:13.836]  You just put the number 700.
[01:39:13.836 --> 01:39:18.057]  That's my code to register a vote for me.
[01:39:18.057 --> 01:39:24.679]  So, 96,000 is like the phone number you send a text to, and then 700 is the message.
[01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:31.561]  If you also vote by email, you go to RadioVote.com, and you have to vote in two categories.
[01:39:31.561 --> 01:39:36.703]  One for somebody in music, and then someone in talk, which is my area.
[01:39:37.523 --> 01:39:45.189]  And then just vote for whoever you want in the music section, and then just click me at radiovote.com in the talk section, and they record it.
[01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:49.432]  But again, if you've got 15 different email addresses, you can vote 15 times.
[01:39:51.547 --> 01:39:55.328]  Well, I'm looking at who you're up against, and some of them are some nice folks, but give me a break.
[01:39:55.328 --> 01:40:06.632]  George, you arguably are the number one radio host in the world, and you're on at night, which even, I mean, you've got 60 percent, I know, of the overnight radio listening audience of the U.S., and you've just done so much for the Liberty Movement.
[01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:13.055]  You were the first big guy to expose vaccines on a national platform, and I don't know how you were able to do it, because I know
[01:40:13.955 --> 01:40:16.317]  Uh, that they put the screws to people.
[01:40:16.317 --> 01:40:21.362]  You haven't really told me this, but I know some of the things that have gone on, and that's a question.
[01:40:21.362 --> 01:40:31.651]  How were you able to take Coast to Coast from 80% entertainment, which is still fun and good, nobody's saying it's bad, to, you know, uh, 70% real news and 30% fun?
[01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:34.734]  I mean, I think you almost flipped it and made it even more popular.
[01:40:34.734 --> 01:40:35.775]  How were you able to do that?
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.622]  The world changed at Alex.
[01:40:38.622 --> 01:40:40.765]  So many things have been happening on this planet.
[01:40:40.765 --> 01:40:51.179]  They're still happening on this planet that it was almost irresponsible just to go on the air and do the entertainment end of the show, which is fun and important, and I love that.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:57.322]  But to be able to do that every night, I think was a little inappropriate and irresponsible.
[01:40:57.322 --> 01:41:00.644]  There's just too many things happening on this planet right now.
[01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:02.985]  With the Deep State and everything else.
[01:41:02.985 --> 01:41:05.886]  Oh, you were covering Deep State when you were the number one host in St.
[01:41:05.886 --> 01:41:07.427]  Louis 25 years ago.
[01:41:07.427 --> 01:41:08.567]  I was covering it.
[01:41:08.567 --> 01:41:11.288]  Yeah, but I mean, you were the guy that brought Deep State.
[01:41:11.288 --> 01:41:13.569]  Remember, it was all over the news when you had me on.
[01:41:13.569 --> 01:41:16.350]  CNN, C-SPAN, don't have Alex Jones on.
[01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:18.131]  Bohemian Grove doesn't exist.
[01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:20.112]  Remember, global government didn't exist?
[01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:22.973]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:41:22.973 --> 01:41:32.623]  And you have been sadly misquoted on a number of things that you've said on your show and my show where people just take things out of context.
[01:41:32.623 --> 01:41:38.009]  The things that you've done and I'd love putting you on so we can straighten it out.
[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:42.712]  Because I've had family stuff and a baby came and I've had no sleep.
[01:41:42.712 --> 01:41:43.292]  But now I'm better.
[01:41:43.292 --> 01:41:44.813]  The baby's big and sleeps through the night now.
[01:41:44.813 --> 01:41:46.094]  That's why I've been able to come on.
[01:41:46.094 --> 01:41:47.434]  I'm usually begging to come on.
[01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.935]  The last year he invited me on, I couldn't do it.
[01:41:48.935 --> 01:41:50.576]  Because, you know, you have children.
[01:41:50.576 --> 01:41:52.577]  You know how it is for years.
[01:41:52.577 --> 01:41:53.938]  Oh yeah, I have six grandchildren now.
[01:41:54.378 --> 01:41:56.159]  So I'm a zombie, but I'm better now.
[01:41:56.159 --> 01:42:00.520]  I would love to come on and do a few hours and really go through all the disinfo.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.122]  Like, I've apologized to the Sandy Hook parents, even though the media took it out of context for three years.
[01:42:05.122 --> 01:42:07.522]  And the media keeps saying, Alex Jones says nobody dies.
[01:42:07.522 --> 01:42:09.663]  He's attacking the families when I'm not.
[01:42:09.663 --> 01:42:14.305]  And so, yeah, I would love to come on and just cover the waterfront in real quotes about what I really stand for.
[01:42:14.305 --> 01:42:14.765]  That'd be great.
[01:42:15.666 --> 01:42:16.327]  Absolutely.
[01:42:16.327 --> 01:42:30.377]  I mean, we have had you on where I have specifically said to you, Alex, I want you to tell people what you really think, what you said, and you correct it for people so the misunderstandings are fixed.
[01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:37.142]  And I hope that's helped you a little bit because... It certainly had years ago, but enough about me, because I'm not kissing your butt, it's true.
[01:42:37.702 --> 01:42:46.309]  George Norey, if you track the entire spectrum of who woke this country up, who allowed people like me to take it to the next level, he took us to the next level.
[01:42:46.309 --> 01:42:47.290]  It's two people.
[01:42:47.290 --> 01:42:47.711]  Two people.
[01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:49.392]  It's Matt Drudge and George Norey.
[01:42:49.392 --> 01:42:50.193]  Two people.
[01:42:50.193 --> 01:42:52.555]  We're going to come back and talk about key issues straight ahead.
[01:42:52.555 --> 01:42:54.697]  And I'm going to ask you about the great Art Bell.
[01:42:58.126 --> 01:43:02.712]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:43:02.712 --> 01:43:03.273]  Thanks for calling.
[01:43:03.273 --> 01:43:04.714]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:43:04.714 --> 01:43:08.319]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:43:08.319 --> 01:43:17.070]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:33.330]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:42.436]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:43:42.436 --> 01:43:47.340]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:52.944]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:43:57.608 --> 01:44:01.569]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:04.851]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:11.113]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:11.113 --> 01:44:13.894]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.634 --> 01:44:18.456]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.456 --> 01:44:24.921]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.921 --> 01:44:29.884]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.632 --> 01:44:34.554]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.554 --> 01:44:41.757]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.757 --> 01:44:46.459]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.459 --> 01:44:52.661]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:56.643]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.851 --> 01:45:01.172]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:47:01.758 --> 01:47:14.268]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.268 --> 01:47:18.511]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:19.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.923]  That's right, mainstream corporate media is dying, but George Norie and InfoWars are continuing and expanding.
[01:47:26.923 --> 01:47:29.724]  George was saying some pretty powerful stuff during the break.
[01:47:29.724 --> 01:47:36.188]  He wants to get into what's happening with the migrant children, what he really thinks is there, Korea, and other issues.
[01:47:36.188 --> 01:47:37.509]  But Art Bell, I mean, look.
[01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:41.188]  I don't know who I think is a better talk show host, you or him.
[01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:44.631]  You're two of the most listenable, smartest guys ever.
[01:47:44.631 --> 01:47:46.092]  He could tell a story.
[01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:49.875]  He could really, you know, it was amazing.
[01:47:49.875 --> 01:47:54.279]  But again, your political understanding was a little bit even more expansive.
[01:47:54.279 --> 01:47:56.181]  So I don't know who's a better talk show host.
[01:47:56.181 --> 01:47:57.422]  I've got to say out of the two of you,
[01:47:58.343 --> 01:47:59.785]  And I'm serious.
[01:47:59.785 --> 01:48:05.811]  The two of you are probably, in my mind, the best, most listenable talk show host in U.S.
[01:48:05.811 --> 01:48:06.652]  history.
[01:48:06.652 --> 01:48:08.975]  Because I've listened to a lot of them.
[01:48:08.975 --> 01:48:10.576]  And so, Art is gone.
[01:48:10.576 --> 01:48:13.800]  He's the guy that originally launched the show that you took over and expanded.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.522]  I just wanted to spend a few minutes on Art Bell.
[01:48:16.519 --> 01:48:18.280]  Sure thing, Alex.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.181]  We were different.
[01:48:19.181 --> 01:48:22.523]  Art was very, very good at what he did.
[01:48:22.523 --> 01:48:24.485]  I mean, he was one of a kind.
[01:48:24.485 --> 01:48:30.649]  Had I gone into coast-to-coast to try to duplicate the guy, I would have fallen right on my face.
[01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:32.291]  I mean, you can't do that.
[01:48:32.291 --> 01:48:34.492]  He was a living legend at the time.
[01:48:34.492 --> 01:48:40.917]  I was on the air April 13th this year when we were starting to get reports that he had died.
[01:48:41.777 --> 01:48:43.378]  I gotta tell you, I didn't believe it.
[01:48:43.378 --> 01:48:45.360]  I thought somebody was joking us.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.221]  It was a fake news story.
[01:48:47.221 --> 01:48:53.705]  I kept telling my producer, Tom Danheiser and Lisa Lyon, I said, you two need to find out if this is real or not.
[01:48:53.705 --> 01:48:58.468]  I am not going on the air saying that he has died and be wrong.
[01:48:58.468 --> 01:48:59.989]  Not on this.
[01:48:59.989 --> 01:49:01.690]  That's just not my style.
[01:49:01.690 --> 01:49:06.293]  And so we kept checking and checking and checking and it was just a weird story, Alex.
[01:49:06.293 --> 01:49:07.694]  It was weird.
[01:49:07.694 --> 01:49:08.215]  Finally,
[01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:17.401]  The Nye County Sheriff's Department put a video out that said that he had died, and then George Knapp backed it up for me, and he said, yeah, he's gone.
[01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:19.523]  And we went with the story.
[01:49:19.523 --> 01:49:26.768]  But for hours, while we were getting trickling in reports that he had died, I didn't believe it.
[01:49:26.768 --> 01:49:27.929]  Nobody did.
[01:49:27.929 --> 01:49:33.213]  To this day, and here we are about two months later, they still don't have a cause of death.
[01:49:33.213 --> 01:49:34.694]  They have not released it.
[01:49:35.314 --> 01:49:42.976]  They keep telling us that if they get it, it'll go to the Nye County Sheriff's Department, then it's up to them to release it.
[01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:47.318]  It is a bizarre story, but also one of the saddest.
[01:49:47.318 --> 01:49:51.939]  Art, yesterday, would have turned 73 years old on Father's Day.
[01:49:51.939 --> 01:49:53.760]  Happy Father's Day to you too, Alex.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.480]  But, sad story.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.981]  Just tragic indeed.
[01:49:56.981 --> 01:50:01.402]  He was suffering with chronic lung disease, COPD.
[01:50:01.402 --> 01:50:03.583]  Was hospitalized some time ago for it.
[01:50:04.862 --> 01:50:07.804]  I think that had a lot to do with it, but nobody knows.
[01:50:19.308 --> 01:50:21.391]  Because there aren't a lot of people that impress me.
[01:50:21.391 --> 01:50:23.013]  You know, Hollywood, all that stuff.
[01:50:23.013 --> 01:50:24.975]  Trump impresses me because he's a maverick.
[01:50:24.975 --> 01:50:25.916]  You're a maverick.
[01:50:25.916 --> 01:50:30.141]  What I really respect is trailblazers and mavericks and people that go against the grain.
[01:50:30.141 --> 01:50:32.164]  And he's one of the greats.
[01:50:32.164 --> 01:50:37.891]  So a really sad passing there, obviously, but he'll live on through his work.
[01:50:38.551 --> 01:50:40.093]  Obviously forever.
[01:50:40.093 --> 01:50:45.457]  Let's briefly get into your view on Trump and what he's done a year and a half in.
[01:50:45.457 --> 01:50:48.099]  Looks to me like he's winning, he's turning the tide, the country's coming back.
[01:50:48.099 --> 01:50:52.943]  You had a word during the break for what he's done with Korea.
[01:50:52.943 --> 01:50:53.784]  Brilliant.
[01:50:53.784 --> 01:50:55.465]  Absolutely brilliant.
[01:50:55.465 --> 01:51:02.291]  And if this works the way that everybody intends it to work, this could be one of the most dramatic
[01:51:03.306 --> 01:51:06.167]  Political moves I have ever seen.
[01:51:06.167 --> 01:51:07.508]  Something that no U.S.
[01:51:07.508 --> 01:51:10.869]  President has been able to do since the Korean War.
[01:51:10.869 --> 01:51:13.510]  He's been able to pull this off, apparently.
[01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:18.652]  And let's keep our fingers crossed that everything works out the way it is.
[01:51:18.652 --> 01:51:22.914]  Despite the fact that, you know, of course there's human rights issues in North Korea.
[01:51:22.914 --> 01:51:24.515]  Kim Jong-un has been a butcher.
[01:51:25.115 --> 01:51:29.057]  He has killed off his uncle when the guy fell asleep in a meeting.
[01:51:29.057 --> 01:51:31.337]  They've done all kinds of bizarre things.
[01:51:31.337 --> 01:51:36.159]  But the bottom line is, do we want a war with another country?
[01:51:36.159 --> 01:51:38.400]  And the answer is absolutely not.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:42.442]  And there are times... But also, the only way to ever get them free is to do this.
[01:51:42.442 --> 01:51:43.662]  It'll go on for another 100 years.
[01:51:43.662 --> 01:51:46.003]  It's been going on 60 plus years.
[01:51:46.003 --> 01:51:48.904]  And if they'll bring in industry, it'll only help their people.
[01:51:50.264 --> 01:51:51.925]  Absolutely, and that's what we have to do.
[01:51:51.925 --> 01:52:00.567]  So we have to, one, get them to disarm, get rid of those nukes, and then help them rebuild their country, get rid of our troops.
[01:52:00.567 --> 01:52:02.728]  We don't need 30,000 troops there anymore.
[01:52:02.728 --> 01:52:06.229]  And let's make this planet a place to be.
[01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:11.510]  Then we've got to concentrate on Iran and get that fixed before that gets out of control.
[01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:14.271]  But I think I would give Donald Trump
[01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:19.737]  An A- so far for his time in office.
[01:52:19.737 --> 01:52:26.940]  The only thing I've been critical about about what he's been doing lately is just his tweeting and stuff like that.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:36.605]  On one hand, I know what he's trying to do with that, but on the other, I think he needs to just calm down a little bit, be a little more presidential.
[01:52:36.605 --> 01:52:38.886]  The guy could go down in history as one of the great ones.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:47.173]  I agree with you at some level, but at the same time, they lie about him so much, and he wants to respond to us.
[01:52:47.173 --> 01:52:48.433]  I think that's why he's a maverick.
[01:52:48.433 --> 01:53:03.420]  Now, separately here, before we forget, because I really want you to win this, and I saw this, and I knew you were right up there at the top, running about to win it, but like you said, they've got so many other people trying to, I don't want to say rig it, but every device is able to vote once.
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:06.381]  So I want you to win this, because I'm really thinking of something to do for George Nory.
[01:53:06.881 --> 01:53:07.882]  And I saw this.
[01:53:07.882 --> 01:53:08.643]  I saw this on television.
[01:53:08.643 --> 01:53:11.086]  They were talking about the Radio Hall of Fame situation.
[01:53:11.086 --> 01:53:12.607]  RadioVote.com.
[01:53:12.607 --> 01:53:15.350]  You absolutely deserve to be in there.
[01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:19.535]  We need to celebrate patriots that have been telling the truth and have been really promoting free speech.
[01:53:19.535 --> 01:53:21.317]  RadioVote.com.
[01:53:21.317 --> 01:53:23.259]  And folks, go there.
[01:53:23.259 --> 01:53:26.643]  George Norie, again, how do people vote when they get there?
[01:53:27.938 --> 01:53:30.741]  All right, if you have a cell phone, grab it right now.
[01:53:30.741 --> 01:53:32.744]  Send a text message to this number.
[01:53:32.744 --> 01:53:35.968]  96000.
[01:53:35.968 --> 01:53:37.550]  That's 96,000.
[01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:38.651]  That's like the phone number.
[01:53:38.651 --> 01:53:41.214]  All you have to do is do those digits.
[01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:41.815]  96000.
[01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:43.317]  And then in the message,
[01:53:45.559 --> 01:53:50.181]  You put 700 because that's how they record a vote for me.
[01:53:50.181 --> 01:53:51.002]  700.
[01:53:51.002 --> 01:53:51.962]  And just send it.
[01:53:51.962 --> 01:53:58.065]  And then you get a response back right away from the National Radio Hall of Fame that says your vote's been accepted.
[01:53:58.065 --> 01:54:03.968]  Then you can also go online with your email address to radiovote.com.
[01:54:03.968 --> 01:54:06.509]  You vote for somebody in the music category.
[01:54:06.509 --> 01:54:08.430]  It's the first segment you'll see.
[01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:12.172]  And then in the talk category there's a little tiny button there that you gotta
[01:54:12.872 --> 01:54:16.536]  Dot in and then vote for me, and that's it.
[01:54:16.536 --> 01:54:20.819]  They will announce the winner on June 25th, next Monday.
[01:54:20.819 --> 01:54:22.661]  Now let's keep our fingers crossed.
[01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:27.820]  Now, I asked you during the break, I said, what's something else you want to get into on air?
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.660]  We'll put it on screen.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:40.845]  There were a whole bunch of news articles that are these PR pieces that called for my videos that happened to be streamed on Amazon service that we put up there years ago, that they want it banned.
[01:54:40.845 --> 01:54:42.726]  And what they're saying is they want me banned from the Internet.
[01:54:42.726 --> 01:54:45.407]  It's like saying we want books to be banned.
[01:54:45.407 --> 01:54:46.368]  Now, even if I was Hitler,
[01:54:47.028 --> 01:54:50.771]  You know, they sell Mein Kampf, my struggle, on Amazon.
[01:54:50.771 --> 01:54:51.552]  They sell it at bookstores.
[01:54:51.552 --> 01:54:55.775]  I remember one time in college, I was buying a copy of Mein Kampf, so I wanted to read what Hitler said.
[01:54:55.775 --> 01:54:57.537]  The lady said, are you a Nazi?
[01:54:57.537 --> 01:54:58.117]  Like, they were free.
[01:54:58.117 --> 01:54:59.018]  I said, why are you selling it?
[01:54:59.018 --> 01:54:59.538]  Are you a Nazi?
[01:55:00.612 --> 01:55:07.618]  So even though I was a bad guy, how is it good to say Amazon is hawking bizarre conspiracy theory films?
[01:55:07.618 --> 01:55:17.367]  They go on to say Business Insider, you name it, a bunch of articles that came out, because this is all lined up, ban me from the internet, ban my films, get them off.
[01:55:17.367 --> 01:55:23.532]  I mean, that idea that they're pushing that is the modern book burning, isn't it, George?
[01:55:23.532 --> 01:55:24.193]  You're critics.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.981]  Alex, don't get you.
[01:55:26.981 --> 01:55:28.582]  They don't understand.
[01:55:28.582 --> 01:55:30.803]  They don't understand free speech.
[01:55:30.803 --> 01:55:33.224]  They don't understand what you're all about.
[01:55:33.224 --> 01:55:36.826]  And they don't understand that you're out to protect our freedoms.
[01:55:36.826 --> 01:55:37.847]  They don't get it!
[01:55:37.847 --> 01:55:43.450]  And so, consequently, when they hear you, and, look, you're an emotional guy when you talk.
[01:55:43.450 --> 01:55:45.171]  I've seen you in person.
[01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:46.612]  You get people excited.
[01:55:46.612 --> 01:55:47.812]  That's you.
[01:55:47.812 --> 01:55:48.713]  That's your style.
[01:55:49.193 --> 01:55:55.975]  But when some of these critics hear you, they think, oh my god, this guy's out of control, and they want you out.
[01:55:55.975 --> 01:55:57.435]  They want you banned.
[01:55:57.435 --> 01:55:58.596]  And you know what?
[01:55:58.596 --> 01:56:00.716]  That's not the American way.
[01:56:00.716 --> 01:56:03.057]  Everything you do, you have a right to do.
[01:56:03.057 --> 01:56:06.418]  I've never heard you with profanity against somebody.
[01:56:06.418 --> 01:56:07.118]  You've been tough.
[01:56:07.718 --> 01:56:18.705]  But you're a, you know, you're a decent guy, you're a family guy, and your work deserves to be displayed, whether it's on Amazon or on the internet.
[01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:22.608]  And I thank God we still have this freedom to be able to do stuff like that.
[01:56:22.688 --> 01:56:28.131]  Well, I was about to say, the universities are already trying to ban conservative, libertarian, Christian, nationalist speech.
[01:56:28.131 --> 01:56:36.757]  When you've got Business Insider, who's usually pretty good, and others, because there's a head out on me politically, saying he doesn't deserve to be online, ban his films.
[01:56:36.757 --> 01:56:38.098]  And by the way, these are old films.
[01:56:38.098 --> 01:56:40.279]  I'm not against the police, I'm against the police state.
[01:56:40.279 --> 01:56:51.386]  The left is so concerned about police states now, they list the films Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, and films about the deep state, and they say they want it banned.
[01:56:52.898 --> 01:56:56.159]  And they said they want it banned because I pointed out the London bombings were staged.
[01:56:56.159 --> 01:56:58.439]  Yes, they let the guys bomb.
[01:56:58.439 --> 01:57:01.000]  That was in major British newspapers.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.441]  And so they report it like they're reporting some evil dirtiness.
[01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:12.183]  The big dirtiness is that you have Gizmodo and others calling for... Look, if they can ban my films or my books, George, they can ban anybody's, can't they?
[01:57:12.984 --> 01:57:13.745]  That's right.
[01:57:13.745 --> 01:57:14.186]  That's right.
[01:57:14.186 --> 01:57:19.013]  We may have a segment on one night, and they decide, we don't want this guy to talk about that.
[01:57:19.013 --> 01:57:20.916]  Clip, clip, clip.
[01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:22.338]  And you just can't do it.
[01:57:22.338 --> 01:57:24.902]  We cannot regulate the internet like that.
[01:57:24.902 --> 01:57:26.624]  One thing else.
[01:57:27.355 --> 01:57:29.036]  They did that with my Joe Rogan interview.
[01:57:29.036 --> 01:57:31.016]  Went to number one on iTunes.
[01:57:31.016 --> 01:57:32.097]  They blocked it.
[01:57:32.097 --> 01:57:34.277]  And then Joe hadn't had me back on because he got the message.
[01:57:34.277 --> 01:57:35.458]  Hey, you have Alex Jones on.
[01:57:35.458 --> 01:57:37.418]  We're going to kick you off Apple and YouTube.
[01:57:37.418 --> 01:57:38.579]  That's his only platform.
[01:57:38.579 --> 01:57:39.019]  That's OK.
[01:57:39.019 --> 01:57:40.199]  I understand that.
[01:57:40.199 --> 01:57:44.120]  I just hope that Rogan understands down the road they're going to ban him anyways.
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.581]  We'll be back with a few more minutes with George Nori.
[01:57:47.315 --> 01:57:57.903]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.903 --> 01:57:59.965]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.965 --> 01:58:02.827]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.827 --> 01:58:04.328]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.328 --> 01:58:07.451]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.691 --> 01:58:11.134]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.134 --> 01:58:13.236]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.236 --> 01:58:22.944]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.944 --> 01:58:35.255]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:58:35.435 --> 01:58:39.740]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:43.044]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[01:59:51.345 --> 01:59:53.986]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.077 --> 02:00:11.941]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:11.941 --> 02:00:16.606]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.606 --> 02:00:18.787]  Well, the great George Norrie is with us.
[02:00:18.787 --> 02:00:25.774]  Coast to Coast AM, Midnight Central Time, 10pm Pacific, coasttocoastam.com.
[02:00:25.774 --> 02:00:31.979]  George, you're a newsman, you know, in your own right, three-time Emmy Award winning newsman.
[02:00:31.979 --> 02:00:32.580]  I mean, this is...
[02:00:33.812 --> 02:00:41.554]  Eisenhower, Clinton, Bush era, when thousands come across a day, sometimes whole groups, no one knows who's who.
[02:00:41.554 --> 02:00:43.755]  They put adults in one area, kids in another.
[02:00:43.755 --> 02:00:47.496]  I mean, they're saying it's a concentration camp, the kids are there.
[02:00:47.496 --> 02:00:50.637]  They're saying Trump's a Nazi, Hayden is.
[02:00:50.637 --> 02:00:52.357]  I mean, I've got a memory.
[02:00:52.357 --> 02:00:53.738]  Obama did all this too.
[02:00:53.738 --> 02:00:57.299]  What do you think's going on there, or do you disagree with me?
[02:00:57.299 --> 02:01:01.700]  Well, first of all, Alex, we're talking about illegal immigration.
[02:01:03.018 --> 02:01:06.199]  Violation of American law.
[02:01:06.199 --> 02:01:08.840]  And we have to keep our borders tight.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.681]  I mean, that's just a sad way to do it.
[02:01:10.681 --> 02:01:18.343]  Now, on the other hand, and this is so important that everybody understands this, people want a better living style.
[02:01:18.343 --> 02:01:22.745]  They want to get out of the country they're in because their life is not working.
[02:01:22.745 --> 02:01:24.525]  They're not making any money.
[02:01:24.525 --> 02:01:26.766]  Their lifestyle is horrible.
[02:01:26.766 --> 02:01:31.728]  I can understand that it's the saddest, saddest thing that we have to go through as a nation.
[02:01:32.388 --> 02:01:42.099]  They have to deny people the right to come through into our country, which is wonderful and perfect as far as I'm concerned, and say no to these people.
[02:01:44.551 --> 02:01:46.892]  You gotta do something about control.
[02:01:46.892 --> 02:01:52.434]  And you just can't have thousands of people coming across the border without any control.
[02:01:52.434 --> 02:01:53.755]  Every day.
[02:01:53.755 --> 02:01:54.235]  Every day.
[02:01:54.235 --> 02:01:55.375]  So that's gotta be stopped.
[02:01:55.375 --> 02:01:59.697]  Now, the second question is separating kids from their families.
[02:01:59.697 --> 02:02:03.219]  Well, first of all, in some cases, they're not really family.
[02:02:03.219 --> 02:02:05.419]  They're just kids coming over with them.
[02:02:05.419 --> 02:02:08.861]  Family members are using these kids to get across the border.
[02:02:09.601 --> 02:02:18.992]  But you can't put, sadly enough, you can't put kids in these areas that you've got the adults hold up.
[02:02:18.992 --> 02:02:20.193]  It's just unhealthy.
[02:02:20.193 --> 02:02:22.136]  It's just not good.
[02:02:22.136 --> 02:02:23.898]  It's a horrible situation.
[02:02:23.898 --> 02:02:24.959]  There are no winners here.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:31.825]  We, as a country, we don't win, and these people who are coming across the border don't win.
[02:02:31.825 --> 02:02:38.549]  We've got to do something a little better with legal immigration, maybe let more people in.
[02:02:38.549 --> 02:02:47.636]  We have to definitely check them all out, because there are a lot of criminals that come across the border, and we don't want anything to do with them.
[02:02:47.636 --> 02:02:48.977]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:02:48.977 --> 02:02:49.417]  That's the thing.
[02:02:49.417 --> 02:02:54.561]  The third world's collapsing, and we can't then just say, oh, everybody come, it'll be just like Europe and a total collapse.
[02:02:55.121 --> 02:02:55.882]  You can't do that.
[02:02:55.882 --> 02:02:56.662]  It's sad.
[02:02:56.662 --> 02:02:59.583]  Look, it's the worst situation to be in.
[02:02:59.583 --> 02:03:00.164]  It's sad.
[02:03:00.164 --> 02:03:04.786]  I mean, I think the Palestinian situation with the Israelis is sad.
[02:03:04.786 --> 02:03:08.047]  Those people deserve their own homeland.
[02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:10.809]  You know, the Gaza Strip and stuff like that?
[02:03:10.809 --> 02:03:12.930]  It's a disaster.
[02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:17.032]  But something's got to be done worldwide.
[02:03:17.032 --> 02:03:18.812]  I mean, these are huge problems.
[02:03:20.885 --> 02:03:23.187]  You know, we have to deal with it as a nation.
[02:03:23.187 --> 02:03:29.911]  Exactly, but if the first world just opens itself up to six and a half billion people in the third world, we know it's a giant sucking sound.
[02:03:29.911 --> 02:03:34.975]  It will make us third world as well, and it will be a total global disaster.
[02:03:34.975 --> 02:03:36.015]  You cannot do it.
[02:03:36.015 --> 02:03:40.678]  It's like you have one piece of food and four people to feed.
[02:03:40.678 --> 02:03:42.059]  Somebody's going to get it.
[02:03:42.059 --> 02:03:43.020]  The other ones aren't.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:43.960]  It's like a lifeboat.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.102]  Let's say the lifeboat takes 100 people, and the UN is going to try to put 500 in the lifeboat.
[02:03:48.102 --> 02:03:52.865]  We're going to sink the whole lifeboat, and it's not our responsibility to save those countries, even if we could.
[02:03:52.865 --> 02:03:54.586]  And if we could, I wish we could.
[02:03:54.586 --> 02:03:56.066]  It's just an incredible situation.
[02:03:56.066 --> 02:04:03.630]  Coast2CoastAM.com, BeyondBelief.com, National Radio Hall of Fame, ElectionRadioVote.com.
[02:04:03.630 --> 02:04:05.931]  Go vote for George Norrie there.
[02:04:05.931 --> 02:04:12.575]  Folks, it's just fun to celebrate people who are patriots, and not just to be passive and go, oh, I like what George has done.
[02:04:13.095 --> 02:04:15.856]  I'm not going to go to RadioVote.com and actually vote for him.
[02:04:15.856 --> 02:04:19.717]  Well, if you don't, you know, that's really a sad thing, because I'm now, I'm really rooting now.
[02:04:19.717 --> 02:04:20.957]  I want George to win.
[02:04:20.957 --> 02:04:30.040]  You can also vote by text dial 96000, 96,000, and text message 700 to win and get George in there.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.161]  I want to see him number one.
[02:04:31.161 --> 02:04:35.302]  I know you're right there in the running, George, so thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:35.302 --> 02:04:36.002]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:36.002 --> 02:04:36.782]  Last day to vote.
[02:04:36.782 --> 02:04:37.963]  Let's do it.
[02:04:37.963 --> 02:04:38.263]  All right.
[02:04:39.028 --> 02:04:39.689]  He better win!

[02:07:24.352 --> 02:07:24.532]  Come on!
[02:07:24.532 --> 02:07:24.733]  Come on!
[02:07:24.733 --> 02:07:24.993]  Come on!
[02:07:24.993 --> 02:07:25.273]  Come on!
[02:07:25.273 --> 02:07:25.613]  Come on!
[02:07:25.613 --> 02:07:26.013]  Come on!
[02:07:26.013 --> 02:07:26.453]  Come on!
[02:07:26.453 --> 02:07:26.773]  Come on!
[02:07:26.773 --> 02:07:27.054]  Come on!
[02:07:27.054 --> 02:07:27.254]  Come on!
[02:07:27.254 --> 02:07:27.634]  Come on!
[02:07:27.634 --> 02:07:27.914]  Come on!
[02:07:27.914 --> 02:07:28.094]  Come on!
[02:07:28.094 --> 02:07:28.234]  Come
[02:07:33.243 --> 02:07:37.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 18th day of June 2018.
[02:07:37.785 --> 02:07:43.487]  We're going to be live here for another hour until the fourth hour kicks in.
[02:07:43.487 --> 02:07:50.709]  And then we've got Allie Alexander hosting that, and we've got the War Room for three hours coming up after that.
[02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:51.630]  Border battle!
[02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:51.950]  U.S.
[02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:54.551]  taking in 250 children a day.
[02:07:54.551 --> 02:07:57.752]  DrugReport.com.
[02:07:57.752 --> 02:08:01.133]  And I cannot believe, when I say hoax,
[02:08:05.253 --> 02:08:27.534]  I mean, this is the standard procedure for decades, that when you pick up a group of 100 people and you have no idea who the hell they are, that you take them and you test them for diseases, and you put the children in one area and the women in another and adult males in another, because if you do put people in general population like this, you always get rapes, you always get robberies, you always get child molestation.
[02:08:31.406 --> 02:08:38.148]  There's 30,000 border kids that have just come through in the last month.
[02:08:38.148 --> 02:08:43.210]  I mean, it is getting insane because they're advertising, come here, everything's free.
[02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:48.491]  And Mexico tells folks, you get on that bus, you get on that train, you don't stop.
[02:08:48.491 --> 02:08:50.332]  In our country, you go to El Norte.
[02:08:53.857 --> 02:09:07.061]  And then these people show up, when I fly in, you know, I go through a deal, I show my passport, they look at who I am, they might go search my bags, but oh my gosh, we don't know who you are and you got lice all over you?
[02:09:07.061 --> 02:09:11.723]  We're gonna just turn you loose.
[02:09:11.723 --> 02:09:22.327]  Obama, the first four years of his administration, did hold people at these camps, until they got vetted or whatever, and then they released most of them, and 95% would never show up at their
[02:09:23.826 --> 02:09:25.506]  Immigration hearings.
[02:09:25.506 --> 02:09:27.407]  On average they'd make them wait two years.
[02:09:27.407 --> 02:09:31.428]  Now they're saying the immigration wait under Obama before he left was four years.
[02:09:31.428 --> 02:09:33.809]  So are you going to show up to your hearing in four years?
[02:09:33.809 --> 02:09:39.570]  What are you going to do, put a piece of paper on the wall for four years?
[02:09:39.570 --> 02:09:42.131]  I'd forget.
[02:09:42.131 --> 02:09:45.292]  It's designed so nobody would ever show up.
[02:09:45.292 --> 02:09:49.633]  And then they show some of these busting camps where they put up in these sports stadiums and stuff.
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:58.943]  These hangers, fences, so the adults and the children are separated, and they go, oh, look.
[02:09:58.943 --> 02:10:05.806]  Even Newsweek admits Obama held more than double the number of children in shelters compared to Trump White House.
[02:10:05.806 --> 02:10:08.887]  That's what the Attorney General is saying, and that's true.
[02:10:08.887 --> 02:10:15.749]  But you turn on the news, it's like, this is like Auschwitz, it's like Buchenwald, Dachau.
[02:10:15.749 --> 02:10:17.030]  The former head of the CIA?
[02:10:20.976 --> 02:10:24.439]  I mean, that's cuckoo!
[02:10:24.439 --> 02:10:28.402]  That's cuckoo!
[02:10:28.402 --> 02:10:31.004]  Trump got funding increase for the center, so they're nicer.
[02:10:31.004 --> 02:10:42.193]  So separating mothers and children like the Nazis, even though when he was NSA and CIA director with Obama, that's what they did.
[02:10:42.193 --> 02:10:44.174]  He thinks you're so stupid.
[02:10:47.694 --> 02:10:49.877]  And then I've got the deadly toll of human trafficking.
[02:10:49.877 --> 02:10:50.498]  CNN.
[02:10:50.498 --> 02:10:52.461]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[02:10:52.461 --> 02:10:53.823]  All the sex slaves.
[02:10:53.823 --> 02:10:55.805]  Democrats going bang on the walls.
[02:10:55.805 --> 02:10:57.227]  But remember these articles?
[02:10:57.227 --> 02:11:00.192]  Jakari Jackson and Don Salazar?
[02:11:00.192 --> 02:11:00.272]  2014.
[02:11:00.272 --> 02:11:00.873]  Four years ago.
[02:11:00.873 --> 02:11:02.295]  We ought to grab that video report.
[02:11:02.295 --> 02:11:04.337]  In fact, grab that video report out of this.
[02:11:05.814 --> 02:11:07.896]  Because we exclusively broke it six months later.
[02:11:07.896 --> 02:11:11.999]  New York Times was forced to report it out of the same town, McAllen, Texas.
[02:11:11.999 --> 02:11:12.760]  They go, no, no, no.
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:14.261]  They come in, we don't even vet them.
[02:11:14.261 --> 02:11:15.602]  Not for diseases, nothing.
[02:11:15.602 --> 02:11:16.463]  We just let them in.
[02:11:16.463 --> 02:11:22.048]  Then we interviewed the head of the Border Patrol a year after that, in that sector.
[02:11:22.048 --> 02:11:24.069]  Oh, he risked his job doing that.
[02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:26.431]  And he said, no, we're not even allowed to test them for disease.
[02:11:26.431 --> 02:11:28.954]  And we know that we have black plague.
[02:11:31.294 --> 02:11:36.657]  And he said, we also know that we have leprosy and drug-resistant TB and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:11:36.657 --> 02:11:38.178]  Scabies, you name it.
[02:11:38.178 --> 02:11:52.646]  And they're loaded, and then we follow the buses to Catholic and Protestant churches where there's no vetting, no IDs, and kids are then taken off buses and put in vans with God knows who and disappeared.
[02:11:52.646 --> 02:11:55.348]  That's human trafficking, by the way, under federal law.
[02:11:56.254 --> 02:12:03.635]  When you have undocumented people crossing a national line, undocumented children, or adults, but with children, it's unbelievable.
[02:12:03.635 --> 02:12:12.897]  Hillary had one of her top aides convicted of trying to smuggle black kids out of Haiti, undocumented, but Obama did it.
[02:12:12.897 --> 02:12:20.159]  That's my big frustration, it's why they hate InfoWars, because they can track back that we forced that out.
[02:12:20.159 --> 02:12:21.899]  I keep explaining why they're trying to shut us down.
[02:12:24.155 --> 02:12:39.558]  Because they don't like the fact I can get up here on air and send reporters to the border, Adam Salazar and Jakari Jackson, and get the head of the Border Patrol and the head of Emergency Management and them to just a point blank say, we don't do medical tests, nothing.
[02:12:39.558 --> 02:12:47.040]  These kids show up over a thousand a day in McAllen alone, we load them up and we disappear them into America.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.981]  What in the... And a bunch of them are unaccompanied.
[02:12:53.561 --> 02:12:56.043]  And a lot of them are adults!
[02:12:56.043 --> 02:12:57.424]  And a lot of them are lying about their age.
[02:12:57.424 --> 02:13:00.907]  What planet do you do that?
[02:13:00.907 --> 02:13:04.970]  They could easily check them and enroll them, but they don't want them enrolled.
[02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:11.375]  And with the history of the Democratic Party and all these Democratic officials caught child trafficking, sex trafficking, the coyotes sucking off them, that's what it is.
[02:13:11.375 --> 02:13:13.577]  It's the Democrats feeding off a new underclass.
[02:13:17.486 --> 02:13:23.307]  We've had city council members and Austin's brothers caught with people in dungeons in their basements.
[02:13:23.307 --> 02:13:28.248]  We don't have basements in Texas, except Democrats do.
[02:13:28.248 --> 02:13:37.190]  Where they would hold people and torture them in cages until their family gave them more money.
[02:13:37.190 --> 02:13:39.711]  Oh, but they're Hispanics, so they can't do any wrong.
[02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:40.511]  Don't investigate them.
[02:13:42.412 --> 02:13:46.997]  City official admits Border Patrol fronting cash to bus illegals anywhere in the U.S.
[02:13:46.997 --> 02:13:49.539]  How bombshell is that article?
[02:13:49.539 --> 02:14:03.394]  We ought to flashback this back on Infowars.com and tie it in to the fact that this is what Obama did to stop doing what was going on now and Trump put it back in where no, you don't just show up with a bunch of kids and then just pump them into wherever you want.
[02:14:03.394 --> 02:14:05.516]  That violates federal and international law.
[02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:09.692]  Unbelievable.
[02:14:09.692 --> 02:14:13.496]  Meanwhile, oh, we're putting kids in concentration camps, Hayden says.
[02:14:13.496 --> 02:14:16.220]  Oh, Democrat lawmakers angry with what they saw in South Texas.
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:17.921]  They'd be out in the heat going, it's 100 degrees!
[02:14:17.921 --> 02:14:19.303]  They went inside, it was 72.
[02:14:19.303 --> 02:14:22.326]  What does that even mean?
[02:14:22.326 --> 02:14:25.991]  See the shock video inside Trump's concentration camps, how lavish and nice it is.
[02:14:28.021 --> 02:14:29.461]  Some of the kids get to stay here.
[02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:31.022]  Their parents aren't criminals.
[02:14:31.022 --> 02:14:32.062]  Hadn't committed a bunch of crimes.
[02:14:32.062 --> 02:14:32.822]  They can prove it's them.
[02:14:32.822 --> 02:14:34.443]  A lot of them are getting to stay, actually.
[02:14:34.443 --> 02:14:35.703]  But no.
[02:14:35.703 --> 02:14:40.384]  No, we don't even know who you are, or who you're with, or can't find, or you're with some guy that didn't even your family.
[02:14:40.384 --> 02:14:41.224]  Sorry, you're getting sent back.
[02:14:41.224 --> 02:14:45.986]  I mean, God, since when can we let people just kidnap kids and bring them here?
[02:14:45.986 --> 02:14:46.566]  Flashback!
[02:14:46.566 --> 02:14:50.467]  Obama's HHS placed migrant children into custody of human traffickers.
[02:14:50.467 --> 02:14:51.367]  Daily Caller, remember that?
[02:14:53.370 --> 02:14:54.411]  Of course they did!
[02:14:54.411 --> 02:14:56.153]  That's who you think is there to grab the kids.
[02:14:56.153 --> 02:14:59.416]  This is all a big feeding frenzy of children.
[02:14:59.416 --> 02:15:02.880]  You know, a lot are getting killed in rituals.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:06.223]  Yeah, the MSM is beyond misleading the public about what's going on, but don't worry.
[02:15:06.223 --> 02:15:12.870]  We've got delicate little genius failed actors like John Cusack accused of inciting violence over Trump's immigration policy.
[02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:14.371]  He said, burn down
[02:15:15.913 --> 02:15:17.054]  The emergency centers.
[02:15:17.054 --> 02:15:18.735]  Oh, that's a great idea!
[02:15:18.735 --> 02:15:24.019]  Burn down a facility, a school and food facility and sleeping facility for children.
[02:15:24.019 --> 02:15:25.100]  That's how you free them.
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:29.404]  Just look what a dumb, mindless, this guy's got a lobotomy.
[02:15:29.404 --> 02:15:29.884]  Duh!
[02:15:29.884 --> 02:15:33.247]  There's a superhero, that'd be a question mark.
[02:15:33.247 --> 02:15:35.148]  Like, duh, where'd my brain go?
[02:15:35.148 --> 02:15:37.690]  They're like, can you find your butt with both hands?
[02:15:37.690 --> 02:15:39.052]  What's a butt?
[02:15:39.052 --> 02:15:40.893]  I wanna burn down the children.
[02:15:40.893 --> 02:15:43.175]  I want to save them.
[02:15:43.175 --> 02:15:44.276]  I'm Don Kuzak.
[02:15:45.421 --> 02:15:48.685]  Associated Press says cages describe chain-link partitions.
[02:15:48.685 --> 02:15:49.827]  It's all sick.
[02:15:49.827 --> 02:15:50.448]  It's all lies.
[02:15:50.448 --> 02:15:51.830]  But Laura Bush chimed in.
[02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:53.231]  We'll tell you about her when we come back.
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:58.783]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:15:58.783 --> 02:16:01.244]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:16:01.244 --> 02:16:03.486]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.

[02:20:31.591 --> 02:20:32.252]  877-789-2539.
[02:20:32.252 --> 02:20:35.534]  First-time callers on this topic.
[02:20:35.534 --> 02:20:36.614]  I want to talk about this topic.
[02:20:36.614 --> 02:20:38.215]  If you call, please talk about this topic.
[02:20:38.215 --> 02:20:40.076]  I want to get your take on it.
[02:20:40.076 --> 02:20:42.658]  The hoax that kids are in concentration camps
[02:20:44.448 --> 02:21:08.838]  When the UN has this huge history of kidnapping kids, sex slavery, Rwandan massacres, Haitian slave kids, Associated Press, Democratic Party, open borders, the coyotes, hundreds of thousands of dead total, all these mass graves they're digging up, 80% of the women coming across get raped by the Mexican drug cartels, source on that, MSC International, Huffington Post,
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:19.667]  And then, you know, thousands of people getting grabbed every day per sector, and then they check out who they are and vet them and put them through, and you put the kids in one area and the women in another, the men in another.
[02:21:19.667 --> 02:21:24.751]  Of course, it's not going to be like the Superdome, a big rape party, but that's been the policy for decades!
[02:21:24.751 --> 02:21:31.376]  Trump's trying to change it, and so there's no illegal immigration, but then you can get in easier if you're vetted.
[02:21:31.376 --> 02:21:37.741]  Democrats say, no, we want the UN back in control of immigration, we want UNESCO back in control, we want totally open borders.
[02:21:37.741 --> 02:21:38.622]  Trump says, that's no deal.
[02:21:40.233 --> 02:21:44.376]  So they grandstand and pity party and run around and, hey, let us in, it's hot out here!
[02:21:44.376 --> 02:21:52.401]  I bet the kids are hot inside, we want to see you go in, it's super nice, super clean.
[02:21:52.401 --> 02:21:54.723]  And then the media just keeps going with a lie.
[02:21:54.723 --> 02:22:07.511]  But meanwhile, Laura Bush's husband launched the big illegal Iraq war, even though it was all lies, and fixed intelligence, and the guy that voted for the assault weapons ban, and the guy that wanted open borders.
[02:22:07.511 --> 02:22:08.192]  Laura Bush!
[02:22:09.753 --> 02:22:10.755]  Outraged by U.S.
[02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:15.221]  border policy, but okay with Hubby destroying the Middle East.
[02:22:15.221 --> 02:22:17.925]  Isn't that just perfect?
[02:22:17.925 --> 02:22:21.671]  It breaks her heart.
[02:22:21.671 --> 02:22:22.872]  Awww.
[02:22:22.872 --> 02:22:24.755]  She's such a virtue signaler.
[02:22:25.598 --> 02:22:28.781]  We need Republicans like her again that are really Democrats, don't we?
[02:22:28.781 --> 02:22:39.430]  But don't talk about the huge human toll or NAFTA gap that you helped get through, or all the scams, or any of that, or city official admits border patrol fronting cash to bus illegals anywhere in the U.S.
[02:22:39.430 --> 02:22:40.511]  That was under Obama!
[02:22:41.681 --> 02:22:45.364]  Where he just stopped even testing people for diseases, anything.
[02:22:45.364 --> 02:22:46.585]  Just let him in.
[02:22:46.585 --> 02:22:50.969]  Let's play a clip from that Don Salazar, Jakari Jackson report that needs to go.
[02:22:50.969 --> 02:22:51.930]  We should retweet this.
[02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:55.132]  Remember, Obama stopped putting people in facilities.
[02:22:55.132 --> 02:22:57.494]  He just started letting NGOs.
[02:22:57.494 --> 02:22:59.696]  Oh, the Vatican was the big one.
[02:22:59.696 --> 02:23:00.777]  Oh, here's the Vatican.
[02:23:00.777 --> 02:23:05.441]  Here's a bunch of priests to get undocumented kids with no name and no record.
[02:23:05.441 --> 02:23:07.163]  Here's a bunch of little girls and little boys.
[02:23:08.473 --> 02:23:09.654]  We don't even know if you are a priest.
[02:23:09.654 --> 02:23:11.935]  You're just, oh, I'm a priest alright.
[02:23:11.935 --> 02:23:12.856]  Priest of Satanism.
[02:23:12.856 --> 02:23:14.297]  I'll take care of those kids for you.
[02:23:14.297 --> 02:23:16.639]  And then they disappear.
[02:23:16.639 --> 02:23:17.399]  Unbelievable.
[02:23:17.399 --> 02:23:23.704]  And a bunch of them found dead and smuggled and sold into sex slavery in places like Houston.
[02:23:23.704 --> 02:23:26.426]  After all, people need little kids to rape during the Super Bowl, don't they?
[02:23:26.426 --> 02:23:30.629]  And the special ops people are told to stop.
[02:23:30.629 --> 02:23:31.750]  The warrants are even killed.
[02:23:32.910 --> 02:23:36.291]  Because they have special events going on in special control zones.
[02:23:36.291 --> 02:23:37.832]  Like when they have the Formula One out here.
[02:23:37.832 --> 02:23:39.092]  Have they got the little kids out there?
[02:23:39.092 --> 02:23:41.333]  I've talked to the investigators.
[02:23:41.333 --> 02:23:42.573]  They're blocked from stopping it.
[02:23:42.573 --> 02:23:45.354]  They've thought about just going ahead and going in.
[02:23:45.354 --> 02:23:47.715]  I think that's probably going to happen.
[02:23:47.715 --> 02:23:50.196]  But I digress.
[02:23:50.196 --> 02:23:51.176]  Trump's given the green light.
[02:23:51.176 --> 02:23:54.198]  He says, I don't care what low-levels say or how they try to stop you.
[02:23:54.198 --> 02:23:54.718]  Take them out.
[02:23:54.718 --> 02:23:56.618]  And that's been going on.
[02:23:56.618 --> 02:23:58.119]  But when you take them out like that,
[02:23:59.517 --> 02:24:04.440]  The public can't handle that type of news, so it's kept on the DL?
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:07.362]  That's why the Democrats are so upset, because they're the pedophile party.
[02:24:07.362 --> 02:24:10.984]  They're the child trafficking, human trafficking party, and they've all been caught doing it.
[02:24:10.984 --> 02:24:11.825]  Here's part of that report.
[02:24:12.486 --> 02:24:21.874]  What happened today in particular is that the Border Patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they dropped them off.
[02:24:21.874 --> 02:24:27.119]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[02:24:27.119 --> 02:24:35.045]  Well today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them didn't, hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[02:24:35.045 --> 02:24:39.229]  Look at that concentration camp.
[02:24:39.229 --> 02:24:40.050]  It's a public school.
[02:24:41.408 --> 02:24:45.893]  With a bunch of women and children.
[02:24:45.893 --> 02:24:56.324]  And then they're just... The Democratic Party shows up, we have all the documents, the article, and just gives them $500 and a bus ticket to Democrat Party areas, mainly Chicago and Houston.
[02:24:56.324 --> 02:25:02.190]  And boy, when they get there... It's incredible.
[02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:02.691]  Let's continue.
[02:25:03.536 --> 02:25:06.877]  We're having to find places to shelter them for tonight.
[02:25:06.877 --> 02:25:09.558]  So we've accessed some resources that we have.
[02:25:09.558 --> 02:25:11.279]  We're going to shelter them here tonight.
[02:25:11.279 --> 02:25:13.720]  So why is the Border Patrol bringing them here?
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.020]  They're not bringing them here.
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:23.003]  They're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where the Border Patrol understands that they have transportation to go to the interior.
[02:25:23.003 --> 02:25:23.203]  Right.
[02:25:23.203 --> 02:25:24.344]  So they're dropping them off.
[02:25:24.344 --> 02:25:28.485]  It's our understanding that if they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets,
[02:25:30.504 --> 02:25:37.467]  Turns out some of them didn't tonight, didn't have their ticket or didn't have their voucher or, like I said, their bus isn't till tomorrow.
[02:25:37.467 --> 02:25:38.948]  So they got nowhere to stay.
[02:25:38.948 --> 02:25:44.711]  Our bus terminal, by ours, I mean the city of McAllen, bus terminal is not a 24-7 operation.
[02:25:44.711 --> 02:25:45.051]  Right.
[02:25:45.051 --> 02:25:46.952]  So we've got to put them up somewhere else.
[02:25:46.952 --> 02:25:54.796]  So for tonight, we're doing the best we can with this resource, which thankfully one of our neighboring cities made available to us.
[02:25:54.796 --> 02:25:56.356]  And we're going to put them up here tonight.
[02:25:56.356 --> 02:25:59.418]  Tomorrow we'll have a little chat with the Port of Toronto and see what's going on.
[02:25:59.918 --> 02:26:00.739]  Alright, let's stop there.
[02:26:00.739 --> 02:26:01.519]  That's an 8-minute report.
[02:26:01.519 --> 02:26:08.524]  That's Kevin Pagan, the head of emergency management in McAllen, Texas.
[02:26:08.524 --> 02:26:12.466]  And we have the footage of the people come walk across the border, the Border Patrol takes them.
[02:26:12.466 --> 02:26:17.230]  They take them on vans a half mile to the bus terminal.
[02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:23.414]  They're given money and vouchers and the Democrats are there, the Vatican's there actually, directing where they go.
[02:26:25.178 --> 02:26:26.620]  Wow!
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:33.947]  Now remember, Hillary, one of her top staffers, got convicted of trying to smuggle over 100 kids out of Haiti.
[02:26:33.947 --> 02:26:38.892]  Got caught at the airport trying to get them on a specially chartered jet.
[02:26:38.892 --> 02:26:43.057]  And the Haitians locked her butt up and she got here and got locked up.
[02:26:43.057 --> 02:26:46.941]  The Clinton-Sillsbee trafficking scandal and how the media attempted to ignore and cover it up.
[02:26:47.779 --> 02:26:51.703]  They said it was 33, but it turned out hundreds that she tried to get lined up.
[02:26:51.703 --> 02:26:58.730]  She's now changed her name and runs a child's AIDS group.
[02:26:58.730 --> 02:27:01.513]  Oh my God.
[02:27:01.513 --> 02:27:07.639]  And by the way, hundreds of thousands of kids in the U.S., no one even knows where they are.
[02:27:07.639 --> 02:27:10.462]  But that's put less pressure on your kid getting grabbed out of their backyard.
[02:27:14.295 --> 02:27:16.157]  Was there 2 million kids missing a year?
[02:27:16.157 --> 02:27:20.361]  Yeah, 60-70% are 13, 14, 15 that run away.
[02:27:20.361 --> 02:27:28.268]  But a lot are 1, 2, 3, 4 year old, and they'll take one or two and put them on the news, but the rest, no, no, no.
[02:27:28.268 --> 02:27:33.152]  Got to do something about these missing children grabbed by perverts, too many incidents, fast trial, death penalty.
[02:27:33.152 --> 02:27:33.813]  Yeah, that's Trump.
[02:27:35.546 --> 02:27:40.147]  They're mad that they don't get to never give those kids an ID or have those kids be known.
[02:27:40.147 --> 02:27:42.888]  They're so mad that those kids get an ID.
[02:27:42.888 --> 02:27:44.428]  They're so mad those kids get help.
[02:27:44.428 --> 02:27:49.230]  They're so mad they get three meals and football and basketball and baseball and soccer.
[02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:53.511]  And they're so mad that even with their bad parents or whoever they're with get deported.
[02:27:53.511 --> 02:27:54.771]  In some cases they get to stay here.
[02:27:54.771 --> 02:27:58.492]  They are so pissed that we're just not a total Wild Wild West.
[02:28:04.574 --> 02:28:08.055]  So, Infowars.com, the article's up from earlier in the broadcast.
[02:28:08.055 --> 02:28:10.516]  Please get out that key video to everyone if you want to counter this.
[02:28:10.516 --> 02:28:11.437]  Must see.
[02:28:11.437 --> 02:28:16.339]  Trump imprisonment of migrant children is a giant hoax.
[02:28:16.339 --> 02:28:16.919]  Watch live.
[02:28:16.919 --> 02:28:19.840]  Establishment pushes racist Trump narrative again.
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.502]  And then covers up massive UN and Democratic Party sex crimes.
[02:28:23.502 --> 02:28:26.143]  I have stacks of news of Democratic Party officials.
[02:28:26.143 --> 02:28:27.844]  Folks, I live in Austin.
[02:28:27.844 --> 02:28:29.964]  I don't even pay attention to local news.
[02:28:29.964 --> 02:28:30.685]  There's been, like,
[02:28:31.633 --> 02:28:47.085]  Hundreds of city officials, two city council members, you name it, caught with sex slaves, dungeons, people in... I mean, it's like... It's like they're vampires feeding on Hispanics, this whole underworld.
[02:28:47.085 --> 02:28:54.231]  It's like we've got Mexico, the same way there's mass murder there, going on quietly, but only on Hispanics, by the Hispanics, the Democrats, and the devil worshippers.
[02:28:55.362 --> 02:28:58.384]  Want revenge on the common housefly?

[02:31:59.725 --> 02:32:05.449]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:32:05.449 --> 02:32:13.314]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:32:13.314 --> 02:32:16.456]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:32:16.656 --> 02:32:24.699]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:32:24.699 --> 02:32:33.683]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:32:33.843 --> 02:32:35.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.877 --> 02:33:24.421]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:24.421 --> 02:33:26.562]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.562 --> 02:33:28.862]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:28.862 --> 02:33:33.344]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[02:33:34.923 --> 02:33:36.723]  All right, this is dramatic.
[02:33:36.723 --> 02:33:50.707]  Democrats have come out and are supporting President Trump's detention of undocumented migrant children so they not be put in general population with the thousands of other adults that come in every day.
[02:33:50.707 --> 02:33:52.127]  That's just common sense.
[02:33:52.127 --> 02:33:55.988]  While they're vetted, while they're medically checked, while they're fed.
[02:33:55.988 --> 02:34:04.050]  So in a big turn of events, Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton have come out in support of the president.
[02:34:04.864 --> 02:34:05.404]  It's incredible.
[02:34:05.404 --> 02:34:07.726]  Of course, the issue is they think you don't have a memory.
[02:34:07.726 --> 02:34:08.686]  This is years ago.
[02:34:08.686 --> 02:34:10.968]  This is actually Hillary just a few years ago.
[02:34:10.968 --> 02:34:13.229]  We got Feinstein more than 20 years ago.
[02:34:13.229 --> 02:34:14.730]  But here's Hillary Clinton.
[02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:18.993]  Just because your child reaches the border doesn't mean your child gets to stay.
[02:34:18.993 --> 02:34:19.413]  Here it is.
[02:34:20.572 --> 02:34:23.274]  And many children are fleeing from that violence.
[02:34:23.274 --> 02:34:24.454]  Should they be able to stay here?
[02:34:24.454 --> 02:34:26.095]  It's safer?
[02:34:26.095 --> 02:34:28.257]  It may be safer, but that's not the answer.
[02:34:28.257 --> 02:34:30.318]  I do not... Should they be sent back?
[02:34:30.318 --> 02:34:34.860]  Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide.
[02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:37.342]  We have children five and six years old who have...
[02:34:38.022 --> 02:34:40.183]  Come up from Central America.
[02:34:40.183 --> 02:34:43.764]  We need to do more to provide border security.
[02:34:43.764 --> 02:34:46.064]  So you're saying they should be sent back now?
[02:34:46.064 --> 02:34:54.927]  Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults and their families are, because there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back.
[02:34:54.927 --> 02:34:58.888]  But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.
[02:34:58.888 --> 02:35:04.389]  And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we've got to do more.
[02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:06.030]  I started this when I was secretary.
[02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:12.294]  To deal with the violence in this region, to deal with border security, but we have to send a clear message.
[02:35:12.294 --> 02:35:16.877]  Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.
[02:35:16.877 --> 02:35:25.243]  So we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.
[02:35:29.446 --> 02:35:34.689]  Now that's Hillary in 2016, early 2016, February 2016.
[02:35:34.689 --> 02:35:37.831]  Today she's saying the opposite.
[02:35:37.831 --> 02:35:39.432]  Now, notice she can say it perfectly.
[02:35:39.432 --> 02:35:40.593]  She's smart.
[02:35:40.593 --> 02:35:46.516]  If you implode the border, if you invite people to do this, it invites human smuggling, collapsible stuff like Europe.
[02:35:46.516 --> 02:35:48.217]  She knows.
[02:35:48.217 --> 02:35:54.581]  She was trying to fool voters, it's in the WikiLeaks, by acting conservative or common sense.
[02:35:54.581 --> 02:35:57.823]  Now that she didn't make power, she's showing you who she really is.
[02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:03.261]  It's incredible.
[02:36:03.261 --> 02:36:04.762]  But let's see a few more of these clips.
[02:36:04.762 --> 02:36:05.642]  And it's not just her.
[02:36:05.642 --> 02:36:06.703]  It's Joe Biden.
[02:36:06.703 --> 02:36:08.263]  It's Barack Obama.
[02:36:08.263 --> 02:36:09.164]  It's Dianne Feinstein.
[02:36:09.164 --> 02:36:13.105]  I mean, I have hours of these clips, but I don't want to go to your phone calls.
[02:36:13.105 --> 02:36:18.208]  But I've had Democrats confront me on the street and go, how dare you don't want to take care of the poor migrant children?
[02:36:18.208 --> 02:36:20.929]  Oh, are you taking care of them down in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador?
[02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:22.129]  Are you going down there?
[02:36:22.129 --> 02:36:28.952]  Like my family's actually gone down as missionaries and in the military and other things to try to help people.
[02:36:28.952 --> 02:36:30.153]  No, you haven't done that.
[02:36:32.165 --> 02:36:38.248]  No, you didn't go take Spanish at LSU and then volunteer for Vietnam and then go down and live down there and be a missionary.
[02:36:38.248 --> 02:36:40.889]  No, you didn't do any of that, you Democrats.
[02:36:40.889 --> 02:36:49.913]  You just virtue-signal to everybody else about how great you are, but you don't fight!
[02:36:49.913 --> 02:36:56.657]  You sign on to the communist Chinese plan and then point your finger at those of us who actually fight communism and say we're the enemy.
[02:36:56.657 --> 02:36:57.197]  You're a joke.
[02:36:57.197 --> 02:36:59.318]  But here's another clip.
[02:37:00.592 --> 02:37:02.815]  Hillary Clinton used to sound a lot like Trump.
[02:37:02.815 --> 02:37:05.699]  We're going to go to that one next, and then we're going to play Dianne Feinstein.
[02:37:05.699 --> 02:37:06.000]  Here it is.
[02:37:07.332 --> 02:37:09.192]  We can enforce our borders.
[02:37:09.192 --> 02:37:11.573]  I think we should enforce our borders.
[02:37:11.573 --> 02:37:24.795]  To have a situation where 40% of the babies born on Medicaid in California today are born of illegal immigrants creates a very real problem for the state, which is in deficit.
[02:37:24.795 --> 02:37:26.195]  Of course you can enforce the borders.
[02:37:26.195 --> 02:37:26.975]  Let me finish.
[02:37:26.975 --> 02:37:27.535]  I agree.
[02:37:27.535 --> 02:37:36.057]  To have 17% of our prison population at a cost of $300 million a year, the illegal immigrants who come here and commit felonies,
[02:37:36.277 --> 02:37:37.702]  Alright, that's Feinstein.
[02:37:37.702 --> 02:37:41.334]  Back when the Democrats were behaving like Republicans to get elected and open the border.
[02:37:41.334 --> 02:37:42.518]  Let's continue with Hillary.
[02:37:43.797 --> 02:37:44.177]  Look, I voted.
[02:38:08.018 --> 02:38:08.979]  We will build a wall.
[02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:10.720]  It will do what it's supposed to do.
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:11.761]  Keep illegal immigrants out.
[02:38:27.398 --> 02:38:28.959]  I voted for border security and some of it was a fence.
[02:38:28.959 --> 02:38:30.160]  I don't think we ever called it a wall.
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.401]  Maybe in some places it was a wall.
[02:38:43.772 --> 02:38:44.592]  We're going to have a border.
[02:38:44.592 --> 02:38:46.073]  It's going to be a real border.
[02:38:46.073 --> 02:38:50.614]  Secure our borders with technology, personnel, physical barriers if necessary.
[02:38:50.614 --> 02:38:53.034]  We need to have tougher employer sanctions.
[02:38:53.034 --> 02:38:53.894]  We have a country.
[02:38:53.894 --> 02:38:55.175]  We have to have borders.
[02:38:55.175 --> 02:38:55.915]  We have borders.
[02:38:55.915 --> 02:38:57.335]  We have to have laws.
[02:38:57.335 --> 02:38:59.036]  We either have a country or we don't.
[02:39:04.793 --> 02:39:06.254]  Some of what he said he'd do.
[02:39:06.254 --> 02:39:07.754]  Hillary is the opposite.
[02:39:07.754 --> 02:39:18.379]  And he accepted a bill, like he always said, I will, absolutely, if somebody's been here 20, 30 years and they don't have a criminal record and they're part of society, weren't born here, we'll just fast track them, in a year they'll be citizens.
[02:39:18.379 --> 02:39:27.883]  But if you got a bunch of felonies and you're 40-something years old and claim you've been here for 20 years, but we know you really live in Nicaragua two years ago, your ass is gone!
[02:39:27.883 --> 02:39:29.023]  Real simple.
[02:39:29.023 --> 02:39:33.505]  We should be vetting people with a basic system, just like every other country does.
[02:39:35.049 --> 02:39:36.349]  It's incredible.
[02:39:36.349 --> 02:39:40.091]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls when we come back for a few segments.
[02:39:40.091 --> 02:39:43.652]  And then we've got a guest host coming on, and then Owen Schroeder's loaded for bear.
[02:39:43.652 --> 02:39:44.992]  There's a bunch of other news I didn't hit.
[02:39:44.992 --> 02:39:48.513]  This just broke by Jamie White.
[02:39:48.513 --> 02:39:52.334]  I mentioned this earlier, but this story needs to go really viral.
[02:39:52.334 --> 02:39:54.235]  InfoWars right again.
[02:39:54.235 --> 02:39:59.457]  War inside FBI triggered reopening of Clinton email probe.
[02:39:59.457 --> 02:40:03.898]  And the whole investigation into the reopening on Anthony Weiner.
[02:40:05.296 --> 02:40:19.606]  As we reported from the time from our sources that included the State Police of New York and the State Police of New Jersey and also the Central Intelligence Agency, the good guys that are in there.
[02:40:19.606 --> 02:40:21.728]  We told you all that with Doug Hagman and others.
[02:40:21.728 --> 02:40:22.789]  InfoWars right again.
[02:40:22.789 --> 02:40:26.231]  War inside FBI triggered reopening of Clinton email probe.
[02:40:26.231 --> 02:40:27.832]  IG report confirms.
[02:40:27.832 --> 02:40:28.873]  Patriot agent
[02:40:30.479 --> 02:40:41.188]  Concerned McCabe delayed probe into Anthony Weiner, put pressure on them, causing Comey to reopen it for a week so they could have the excuse to have it reopened to kick it back down to the state.
[02:40:43.137 --> 02:40:53.408]  The Inspector General's report reveals the FBI reopened Hillary Clinton's probe due to pressure from a case agent concerned over private emails found on Anthony Weiner's laptop confirming InfoWars news.
[02:40:53.408 --> 02:41:00.115]  The Feds could cover it up, but there were so many copies of it that when the Patriots saw it and knew, they had to then
[02:41:00.896 --> 02:41:05.600]  Reopen it to then shovel it down to the state level and try to contain it.
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:16.710]  The report explains how a Patriot FBI agent dumbfounded over the fact that top FBI leadership had taken no action in almost a month over the discovery of a batch of emails that was reportedly really bad stuff on Weiner's laptop.
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:21.071]  And it's got all the quotes here, all the documentation.
[02:41:21.071 --> 02:41:24.473]  It's on page 302, which again is the name of an FBI report.
[02:41:24.473 --> 02:41:26.893]  It's kind of a message, like an FBI agent reports.
[02:41:26.893 --> 02:41:28.794]  The field agents report on 302s.
[02:41:28.794 --> 02:41:30.214]  That's the name of the documents.
[02:41:30.214 --> 02:41:31.895]  So funny, they stuck this on page 302.
[02:41:31.895 --> 02:41:34.716]  It's like a little hidden Easter egg saying, here's our real report.
[02:41:34.716 --> 02:41:35.316]  Look at this.
[02:41:35.316 --> 02:41:36.217]  This is the key.
[02:41:36.217 --> 02:41:37.817]  This is what's important.
[02:41:37.817 --> 02:41:39.158]  This is what Comey did.
[02:41:39.158 --> 02:41:40.618]  Comey covered it up.
[02:41:40.618 --> 02:41:42.319]  So it's a big article.
[02:41:42.319 --> 02:41:42.899]  It tells it all.
[02:41:44.369 --> 02:41:50.794]  It's got clips from the emails, from the text messages, from the Inspector General's report, who's testifying, by the way, right now.
[02:41:50.794 --> 02:41:54.937]  We're going to go to a break and come back, just briefly.
[02:41:54.937 --> 02:41:56.418]  I haven't come up with the new specials.
[02:41:56.418 --> 02:41:57.839]  I mean, the specials are already so huge.

[02:42:05.376 --> 02:42:09.179]  That's gotta end today, but I've been so busy covering news and working seven days a week.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:10.339]  I'm not complaining.
[02:42:10.339 --> 02:42:19.666]  I love it, but I was up for Saturday and Sunday that I just haven't gotten around to have a marketing meeting and look at products, what we've got in, what's new, the new specials that are coming.
[02:42:19.666 --> 02:42:22.547]  These are some of the biggest specials ever, and it's gotta end today.

[02:43:55.177 --> 02:43:59.159]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.159 --> 02:44:02.441]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.441 --> 02:44:08.706]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.706 --> 02:44:11.488]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.208 --> 02:44:16.033]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.033 --> 02:44:22.521]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.521 --> 02:44:27.486]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.228 --> 02:44:32.149]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.149 --> 02:44:39.332]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.332 --> 02:44:44.474]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:50.256]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.256 --> 02:44:54.217]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.914 --> 02:45:01.617]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:47:07.874 --> 02:47:14.238]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman Raise her blades and dice in her eyes
[02:47:28.618 --> 02:47:33.282]  Just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[02:47:33.282 --> 02:47:39.146]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[02:47:39.146 --> 02:47:40.768]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[02:47:40.768 --> 02:47:43.309]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:44.330]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:47:44.330 --> 02:47:46.412]  What are you talking about there?
[02:47:46.412 --> 02:47:48.474]  We're gonna ride.
[02:47:48.474 --> 02:47:50.835]  Ride like the one-eyed jack-o-diamonds.
[02:47:50.835 --> 02:47:55.499]  Ride like the one-eyed jack-o-diamonds with the devil close behind.
[02:47:55.499 --> 02:47:56.700]  We're gonna ride.
[02:47:59.036 --> 02:47:59.996]  One-Eyed Jack of Diamonds.
[02:47:59.996 --> 02:48:02.417]  They'll say that's Illuminati.
[02:48:02.417 --> 02:48:05.419]  No, the Illuminati is copying God.
[02:48:05.419 --> 02:48:08.920]  One-Eyed Jack of Diamonds, your spiritual eye.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:11.781]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever.
[02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:12.922]  Sir Willie Nelson.
[02:48:12.922 --> 02:48:19.004]  With the woman and the stallion and the wind.
[02:48:19.004 --> 02:48:23.306]  And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder.
[02:48:26.425 --> 02:48:28.186]  Alright, I'm going right to your phone calls.
[02:48:28.186 --> 02:48:30.328]  I covered a lot of stuff already today.
[02:48:30.328 --> 02:48:32.690]  But the reason I'm really frustrated is...
[02:48:52.637 --> 02:48:57.320]  I haven't hit the really key stuff yet, and that's just the stuff that I had before the show started.
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.743]  So much is broken at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:49:01.743 --> 02:49:08.587]  I may have to host a little bit of the next hour just to get to it, but just, just, just here's one story.
[02:49:08.587 --> 02:49:17.212]  And then remember, when you see this article, go, wait a minute, what did Alex cover two years ago, a year ago, six weeks ago, and last week?
[02:49:20.496 --> 02:49:33.700]  I said that Google and IBM are in competition with each other, with the World Health Organization, with the National Health Service of England, whatever it adopts gets adopted, and with the state of California, and with the VA.
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:37.421]  I'm trying to get this in front of Trump.
[02:49:37.421 --> 02:49:46.364]  Remember you heard about four years ago how they had death panels with a computer and the bioethicist in Arizona for the Veterans Affairs is a beta test?
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.664]  Well, there's the Bloomberg headline today.
[02:49:50.664 --> 02:49:53.508]  They just anticipated where I was going without me even telling the crew.
[02:49:53.508 --> 02:49:55.070]  Boy, they were on target.
[02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:57.234]  If you're a TV viewer, you just saw that.
[02:49:57.234 --> 02:50:01.981]  Google is training machines to predict when a patient will die.
[02:50:01.981 --> 02:50:03.884]  Now translate what that just said.
[02:50:06.647 --> 02:50:10.710]  Google is training machines to decide when you die.
[02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:12.831]  Not to predict, but notice how they spin that.
[02:50:12.831 --> 02:50:18.755]  No, the machines are deciding if they're going to save you and what you've done.
[02:50:18.755 --> 02:50:20.896]  Already under the National Health Service.
[02:50:20.896 --> 02:50:21.737]  Were you a smoker?
[02:50:21.737 --> 02:50:22.557]  Were you overweight?
[02:50:22.557 --> 02:50:23.458]  What was your political thing?
[02:50:23.458 --> 02:50:24.999]  It's already there.
[02:50:24.999 --> 02:50:32.203]  But how are they going to introduce AI computers bypassing doctors and nurses, bypassing even the Bioethics Board?
[02:50:32.203 --> 02:50:33.924]  They quit giving the Hippocratic Oath 20 years ago.
[02:50:33.924 --> 02:50:34.945]  Hippocrates.
[02:50:37.774 --> 02:50:49.424]  And now, they're just putting it out like it's no big deal, saying, Google is training machines to predict when a patient will die.
[02:50:49.424 --> 02:50:54.548]  Oh, they predict so accurately because they will withhold the care.
[02:50:54.548 --> 02:50:56.991]  But they'll say, oh, the machine made the decision.
[02:50:56.991 --> 02:50:58.532]  Who programs the machine?
[02:51:07.897 --> 02:51:11.740]  Unbelievable how they introduced this to us, the slaves.
[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:15.763]  But it's so cute, it's the Zeitgeist Movement.
[02:51:15.763 --> 02:51:20.526]  A computer will decide what I eat, and what I do, and when I, where I work, and who I am.
[02:51:20.526 --> 02:51:25.190]  It decided, it's a computer, it's fancy!
[02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:27.231]  It knows, it's better than me!
[02:51:27.231 --> 02:51:29.012]  It's replacing me!
[02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:31.014]  The future's here!
[02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:35.257]  And the war for the future's been won by international business machines!
[02:51:35.257 --> 02:51:36.358]  And the Watson!
[02:51:39.474 --> 02:51:40.734]  And who is Thomas Watson?
[02:51:40.734 --> 02:51:42.615]  You might want to find out.
[02:51:42.615 --> 02:51:43.715]  Heil Hitler!
[02:51:43.715 --> 02:51:46.976]  Heil Hitler!
[02:51:46.976 --> 02:51:50.176]  The numbers on the Jews in the camps?
[02:51:50.176 --> 02:51:54.337]  And then they name the machine killing our troops after him?
[02:51:54.337 --> 02:51:56.177]  Beautiful.
[02:51:56.177 --> 02:51:59.538]  And it's sickening in your faces.
[02:51:59.538 --> 02:52:01.899]  Because they think you're done.
[02:52:01.899 --> 02:52:03.219]  They think you're an idiot.
[02:52:03.219 --> 02:52:08.000]  And they tune in and they hear me and they go, this guy has got our entire game plan.
[02:52:09.881 --> 02:52:18.485]  And the reason we want him shut down is our own people are compartmentalized going along with it for their own personal gain and aren't fully aware and a lot of them are having crisis of conscience because of Jones.
[02:52:18.485 --> 02:52:24.387]  We thought Jones was discrediting what we were doing to the public so that they wouldn't believe it was happening and he's having the opposite effect.
[02:52:24.387 --> 02:52:26.028]  We want him destroyed.
[02:52:26.028 --> 02:52:28.569]  If you make him a martyr, he'd be more powerful.
[02:52:28.569 --> 02:52:31.450]  Assassinate his character first, then poison him.
[02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:35.611]  And that's the decision.
[02:52:35.611 --> 02:52:40.635]  And I'm not going to commit suicide, but I will say this.
[02:52:40.635 --> 02:52:43.197]  I'm not scared of them.
[02:52:43.197 --> 02:52:45.159]  In fact, it's all a responsibility I have.
[02:52:45.159 --> 02:52:47.040]  It's going to the end no matter what the cost is.
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:47.601]  I have no fear.
[02:52:56.513 --> 02:53:00.637]  Oh, and there's another Tom Watson saying that computers will save us from everything.
[02:53:00.637 --> 02:53:09.485]  Of course, every IQ number shows it's going down, brain waves are going down, cancer's going straight up, everything bad's going up, everything good's going down, sperm counts.
[02:53:09.485 --> 02:53:15.871]  But don't worry, the robots will, the liberals love it, they'll decide who gets the money!
[02:53:15.871 --> 02:53:20.355]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls now.
[02:53:25.725 --> 02:53:28.147]  There's a computer called Thomas Watson.
[02:53:28.147 --> 02:53:30.888]  It's so loving.
[02:53:30.888 --> 02:53:34.831]  The doctors won't have to feel bad it lives and dies.
[02:53:34.831 --> 02:53:39.714]  Because the computer decides his name's Tommy.
[02:53:39.714 --> 02:53:41.515]  Tommy J. Watson.
[02:53:41.515 --> 02:53:42.416]  It's so liberal.
[02:53:50.242 --> 02:53:56.945]  It'll take all your normal functions away and it'll do everything for you until you're obsolete.
[02:53:56.945 --> 02:54:07.749]  The computers are being programmed by the globalists to make you incrementally have your power, incrementally have everything like, oh, we're going to put suspensor belts on you like Baron Harkin and we don't need to walk.
[02:54:09.019 --> 02:54:12.520]  You're like, at first, wow, to walk down the hall, to walk up this hill, it's so much fun.
[02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:13.640]  But you're dying.
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:15.200]  Your muscles are dying.
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:21.742]  You're atrophying as a human, as they take control of every function, until you're being made obsolete, and you're opting into it.
[02:54:21.742 --> 02:54:32.704]  There's always the latest glitz, and, oh God, if I could just have the iPhone X. Yeah, that's what Ray Kurzweil says.
[02:54:32.704 --> 02:54:36.645]  Oh, I may not exterminate you when I become a god, but I might accidentally step on you.
[02:54:37.743 --> 02:54:41.026]  Oh, the robots might keep us as pets.
[02:54:41.026 --> 02:54:42.647]  We that designed it all.
[02:54:42.647 --> 02:54:53.895]  Oh, they're already teaching us.
[02:54:53.895 --> 02:55:00.299]  Who should we go to first?
[02:55:00.299 --> 02:55:01.060]  Charles?
[02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:03.181]  Brian?
[02:55:03.181 --> 02:55:03.862]  Chase?
[02:55:03.862 --> 02:55:04.262]  Jason?
[02:55:07.315 --> 02:55:09.417]  Yeah, let's talk to Jason in New Jersey first.
[02:55:09.417 --> 02:55:11.218]  Jason, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:55:11.218 --> 02:55:12.539]  Go ahead.
[02:55:12.539 --> 02:55:13.500]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:14.861]  Actually in Illinois.
[02:55:14.861 --> 02:55:18.324]  But, uh, Jason in Illinois, we're president.
[02:55:18.324 --> 02:55:21.067]  Uh, I would... They said New Jersey, but it doesn't really matter.
[02:55:21.067 --> 02:55:22.428]  Let's just say... Let's just stop.
[02:55:22.428 --> 02:55:23.268]  Let's start over.
[02:55:23.268 --> 02:55:24.009]  Let's go to your call.
[02:55:24.009 --> 02:55:24.790]  Pshh!
[02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:26.511]  Hello, Jason in Illinois.
[02:55:26.511 --> 02:55:27.492]  Go ahead.
[02:55:27.492 --> 02:55:28.313]  Hello, sir.
[02:55:28.313 --> 02:55:29.213]  Glad to be talking to you.
[02:55:29.213 --> 02:55:30.615]  It's a big time honor.
[02:55:30.615 --> 02:55:31.836]  But I know why they got your name wrong.
[02:55:31.836 --> 02:55:34.098]  Your phone's such hammered hell, I can barely understand you.
[02:55:34.098 --> 02:55:34.818]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:55:34.818 --> 02:55:35.399]  Just get to the point.
[02:55:36.087 --> 02:55:37.388]  Sorry about that.
[02:55:37.388 --> 02:55:40.731]  First thing I would do as president would be to send the U.S.
[02:55:40.731 --> 02:55:50.360]  Air Force into Mexico and send all the cartels in the Mexican government straight to hell where they belong.
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.301]  And call it New Texas.
[02:55:52.301 --> 02:55:54.763]  Call it Mexico, maybe break it up into three.
[02:55:54.763 --> 02:56:01.189]  New Texas, maybe New Illinois, I don't know, maybe Travis after Colonel Travis.
[02:56:01.189 --> 02:56:01.950]  How does that sound?
[02:56:02.992 --> 02:56:05.233]  Oh, name the whole country's, Travis.
[02:56:05.233 --> 02:56:08.594]  Well, I know there's a lot of Hispanic folks in Mexico might actually like that.
[02:56:08.594 --> 02:56:11.915]  You know, the big thing is our big banks are working with the drug cartels.
[02:56:11.915 --> 02:56:19.157]  And I think that's why it's been so hard to fix the problem, is that the globalists have been doing this and using Mexico and Obama using Mexico.
[02:56:19.157 --> 02:56:20.557]  I think Trump's really stopping that.
[02:56:20.557 --> 02:56:22.158]  What do you think?
[02:56:22.158 --> 02:56:26.959]  Yeah, I remember you had an interview with a DEA guy.
[02:56:26.959 --> 02:56:30.240]  He was a native Texan, but he was a... Yeah, Selly Castile.
[02:56:30.825 --> 02:56:31.405]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:56:31.405 --> 02:56:32.906]  I watched that not long ago.
[02:56:32.906 --> 02:56:34.868]  He basically, man, that was important.
[02:56:34.868 --> 02:56:40.031]  That interview was like 12 years ago and he predicted the whole war in Mexico, the collapse, everything, yeah.
[02:56:40.031 --> 02:56:44.554]  Yeah, we've been meddling in Mexico for, you tell me, I don't even know, 40 years?
[02:56:44.554 --> 02:56:46.275]  50 years?
[02:56:46.275 --> 02:56:56.281]  So, you know, it's no wonder they're collapsed, but I think the most humanitarian thing to do would just be to take over the whole darn country and just send all the government and the cartels
[02:56:58.296 --> 02:56:59.997]  Well, there's no doubt that the U.S.
[02:56:59.997 --> 02:57:03.021]  has managed things better than Mexico has.
[02:57:03.021 --> 02:57:05.223]  Mexico never got out from under colonial rule, really.
[02:57:05.223 --> 02:57:06.405]  They just kept the same colonial system.
[02:57:06.405 --> 02:57:09.468]  We've had our own problems, but I don't know.
[02:57:09.468 --> 02:57:13.713]  I mean, it would almost be a better idea than letting Mexico, with the globalists, take over the U.S.
[02:57:14.794 --> 02:57:18.456]  Uh, but, uh, man, I tell you, I just, I just, who knows?
[02:57:18.456 --> 02:57:22.299]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, I don't know, the age of conquest is still going.
[02:57:22.299 --> 02:57:26.961]  The problem is that the, the globalists are using third world to capture the first world now.
[02:57:26.961 --> 02:57:28.922]  So it's, it's an interesting idea.
[02:57:28.922 --> 02:57:30.163]  I can see the headline now.
[02:57:30.163 --> 02:57:30.764]  Jones says...
[02:57:31.744 --> 02:57:33.045]  Invade Mexico.
[02:57:33.045 --> 02:57:36.746]  I know a lot of the really successful wealthy Hispanics in Texas.
[02:57:36.746 --> 02:57:41.768]  Every time I talk to them, they say we should invade Mexico and take over.
[02:57:41.768 --> 02:57:43.488]  Including some of my in-laws.
[02:57:43.488 --> 02:57:44.189]  We'll be right back.

[02:58:51.955 --> 02:58:52.876]  They take hours.
[02:58:52.876 --> 02:58:55.318]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.318 --> 02:58:56.499]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.499 --> 02:58:58.120]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.120 --> 02:59:01.343]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.343 --> 02:59:02.464]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.464 --> 02:59:05.646]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.646 --> 02:59:08.949]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.529]  I think?
[02:59:26.047 --> 02:59:28.228]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:56.903 --> 03:00:14.581]  Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention I did what I had to do Saw it through
[03:00:19.353 --> 03:00:28.739]  All right, I got loaded phones, and I didn't realize that our next guest host has a Brandon Darby, who's a big Breitbart editor, Expose the Border stuff's coming up.
[03:00:28.739 --> 03:00:30.700]  He's a big guest, and others.
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:31.601]  So I gotta go quick here.
[03:00:31.601 --> 03:00:36.364]  I apologize to the callers, but let's go to Kirsten and then Chase and others.
[03:00:36.364 --> 03:00:37.925]  Kirsten, you're on the air from Florida.
[03:00:37.925 --> 03:00:38.946]  Worldwide, thanks for calling.
[03:00:39.790 --> 03:00:40.951]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:00:40.951 --> 03:00:42.493]  This is my third time calling you.
[03:00:42.493 --> 03:00:46.157]  My first time, you did the thing about the Federal Reserve, Obama crash.
[03:00:46.157 --> 03:00:48.079]  That got 8,000 views.
[03:00:48.079 --> 03:00:50.362]  And I'm the Singaporean Chinese girl.
[03:00:50.362 --> 03:00:52.244]  Remember, I called you a couple times.
[03:00:52.244 --> 03:00:59.692]  I've moved to Florida from Tennessee, and I wanted to talk to you about the kids coming in, the migrant kids coming in.
[03:00:59.692 --> 03:00:59.993]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:01:00.729 --> 03:01:07.775]  During Obama in 2014, there were 70,000 migrant kids, which is four times what there is now.
[03:01:07.775 --> 03:01:10.778]  That's right, because Obama invited it, so it caused the flood.
[03:01:11.496 --> 03:01:12.677]  Correct.
[03:01:12.677 --> 03:01:16.300]  And I say e-verify, e-verify, e-verify.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:17.561]  I'm a legal immigrant.
[03:01:17.561 --> 03:01:24.407]  I came here at 15 years old, and I didn't come here to live in an illegal hellhole.
[03:01:24.407 --> 03:01:27.790]  That's not what I signed up for, and that's not what I want.
[03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:29.652]  So really, keep him out.
[03:01:29.652 --> 03:01:32.655]  And on top of that, I take all your products.
[03:01:32.655 --> 03:01:35.958]  I love Survival 2X and the Selenium.
[03:01:35.958 --> 03:01:36.298]  Thank you.
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:42.566]  And I tried to apply for a reporter for you.
[03:01:42.566 --> 03:01:47.793]  I think you might need a Chai Com that speaks Chinese to do a little reporting.
[03:01:47.793 --> 03:01:50.097]  I don't think Chinese people are all Chai Coms.
[03:01:50.097 --> 03:01:51.899]  I mean the government's Chai Com.
[03:01:51.899 --> 03:01:52.921]  You're making a joke!
[03:01:52.921 --> 03:01:53.722]  Oh, I know, I know.
[03:01:54.403 --> 03:01:54.923]  Yeah.
[03:01:54.923 --> 03:01:56.164]  I'm Singaporean-Chinese.
[03:01:56.164 --> 03:01:58.066]  I think you saw the Singaporean Summit.
[03:01:58.066 --> 03:02:01.108]  My country's pretty... I'm Singaporean-American.
[03:02:01.108 --> 03:02:04.151]  My birthplace is pretty amazing.
[03:02:04.151 --> 03:02:05.131]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:02:05.131 --> 03:02:06.032]  I want to visit sometime.
[03:02:06.032 --> 03:02:07.813]  God bless you, Kirsten.
[03:02:07.813 --> 03:02:08.554]  Thank you for the call.
[03:02:08.554 --> 03:02:09.675]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:09.675 --> 03:02:12.177]  And we're looking at all the reporters right now, trying to budget things.
[03:02:12.177 --> 03:02:13.718]  It's all how much funding we have.
[03:02:13.718 --> 03:02:14.779]  I want to hire a bunch of reporters.
[03:02:14.779 --> 03:02:16.540]  Don't worry, but we're trying.
[03:02:16.540 --> 03:02:18.302]  Chase in California, you're on the air.
[03:02:18.302 --> 03:02:18.622]  Go ahead.
[03:02:19.693 --> 03:02:23.436]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex, and thank you for what you do for the country.
[03:02:23.436 --> 03:02:24.077]  You bet, brother.
[03:02:24.077 --> 03:02:27.079]  This is Chase the Patriot on the front lines of California.
[03:02:27.079 --> 03:02:32.064]  I'm fired up about your reporter challenge as well, and I got my YouTube page fired up.
[03:02:32.064 --> 03:02:33.465]  But I want to talk about Trump.
[03:02:33.465 --> 03:02:37.388]  He's turned the corner, I think, with that North Korean peace deal.
[03:02:37.388 --> 03:02:40.511]  People across the left, across the right, everywhere in between.
[03:02:40.976 --> 03:02:44.460]  They all seem to start finally figuring out that he's doing good.
[03:02:44.460 --> 03:02:46.902]  And so now the Democrats are striking back.
[03:02:46.902 --> 03:02:49.124]  They're doing the same old usual tactic.
[03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:50.746]  It's problem, solution.
[03:02:50.746 --> 03:02:53.629]  They commit the problem with the influx of immigrants.
[03:02:53.629 --> 03:02:54.910]  They blame Trump.
[03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:55.911]  They call him a racist.
[03:02:55.911 --> 03:02:57.173]  And then they have the solution.
[03:02:57.173 --> 03:02:59.855]  They say no more Trump and no more borders.
[03:02:59.855 --> 03:03:03.139]  But if we can get out there and put out the narrative by putting our reports out,
[03:03:03.464 --> 03:03:05.785]  Like I'm doing, Chase the Patriot on YouTube.
[03:03:05.785 --> 03:03:07.906]  If we can get out there, we can put the narrative in those eyes.
[03:03:07.906 --> 03:03:08.527]  No, I agree.
[03:03:08.527 --> 03:03:14.290]  Everyone, whether a video has a thousand views or a hundred million or whatever, everyone speaking out, everyone engaged.
[03:03:14.290 --> 03:03:15.771]  Forget the censorship.
[03:03:15.771 --> 03:03:17.632]  So what if you're a patriot and they censor you?
[03:03:17.632 --> 03:03:19.873]  The point is, that's because you're effective.
[03:03:19.873 --> 03:03:20.593]  Absolutely.
[03:03:20.593 --> 03:03:21.694]  Get out there.
[03:03:21.694 --> 03:03:26.676]  Spread the word now more than ever because people are ready for the truth.
[03:03:26.676 --> 03:03:29.318]  Hey, how about a solution to the problem?
[03:03:29.318 --> 03:03:29.538]  You know,
[03:03:30.017 --> 03:03:31.578]  Let's connect the two stories.
[03:03:31.578 --> 03:03:35.121]  So we have the border base in between North and South Korea.
[03:03:35.121 --> 03:03:43.549]  Let's get those troops back and put them in and create a new border base on our own border to protect our own border, to train our troops, to kill two birds with one stone.
[03:03:45.805 --> 03:03:46.586]  I totally agree.
[03:03:46.586 --> 03:03:50.549]  That'd be a great... We just had a big ceasefire happen in Afghanistan.
[03:03:50.549 --> 03:04:01.317]  I was told Trump was going to beef troops up, just like he did with North Korea, to make them come to the table and then actually sign a deal, but a real economic deal, to help the people of Afghanistan so that they stop fighting with each other.
[03:04:01.317 --> 03:04:04.779]  And now it looks like that might happen as well.
[03:04:04.779 --> 03:04:05.980]  So we'll see what happens.
[03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:07.921]  A build-up before we have a build-down.
[03:04:07.921 --> 03:04:08.782]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:08.782 --> 03:04:09.583]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:14.664]  Now, to Brian and Charles and Joe and Liberty and Gerald, I apologize.
[03:04:14.664 --> 03:04:16.586]  The war room's coming up in an hour.
[03:04:16.586 --> 03:04:23.193]  I gotta punch out of here because Ali Alexander has got several big guests lined up.
[03:04:23.193 --> 03:04:26.997]  He's got Brandon Darby, who's always out on the border doing big reporting.
[03:04:26.997 --> 03:04:29.259]  The left attacks him and makes stuff up about him.
[03:04:29.259 --> 03:04:30.340]  I haven't published a note before.
[03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:30.881]  I apologize.
[03:04:31.461 --> 03:04:33.143]  I believe in what left lies about Darby.
[03:04:33.143 --> 03:04:34.284]  He's a great guy.
[03:04:34.284 --> 03:04:34.785]  He's gonna come up.
[03:04:34.785 --> 03:04:36.567]  He's got a lot of great sources on the border.
[03:04:36.567 --> 03:04:37.628]  He's gonna be breaking that down.
[03:04:37.628 --> 03:04:45.956]  And then we've also got Steven Franson who's got a great work on the rise and fight, defeat globalism, save the West.
[03:04:45.956 --> 03:04:46.797]  That's all coming up.
[03:04:46.797 --> 03:04:48.279]  The Philosopher as well.

[03:06:11.671 --> 03:06:17.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:17.878 --> 03:06:21.042]  You still think that Jeff Buell brought down the World Trade Center?
[03:06:24.321 --> 03:06:28.404]  Ali Alexander takes over, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[03:06:28.404 --> 03:06:31.867]  Needs no introduction, political analyst, patriot.
[03:06:31.867 --> 03:06:34.629]  Last year going public with stuff he's been doing behind the scenes.
[03:06:34.629 --> 03:06:38.371]  Follow him on Twitter at Ali, A-L-I.
[03:06:38.371 --> 03:06:42.855]  He's taking over with a bunch of big guests today that you don't want to miss.
[03:06:42.855 --> 03:06:44.656]  Tell us about those guests that are coming up.
[03:06:44.656 --> 03:06:45.917]  Thanks for co-hosting.
[03:06:45.917 --> 03:06:46.878]  The broadcast is yours.
[03:06:47.677 --> 03:06:49.457]  Hey Alex, thanks for the mic.
[03:06:49.457 --> 03:06:52.638]  I'm going to make it down to Austin sometime and we got to do some fellowshipping.
[03:06:52.638 --> 03:06:55.618]  But we have Steve Franson who is a philosopher.
[03:06:55.618 --> 03:07:05.980]  We're going to talk about fatherliness and why we need to make men more masculine and why we need to reclaim some of our masculinity in this age of disinformation.
[03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:08.481]  And then we'll have Brandon Darby with Breitbart Texas.
[03:07:08.481 --> 03:07:09.461]  He's the editor there.
[03:07:09.461 --> 03:07:16.882]  He runs the Cartel Chronicles and he's really taking it to the media, kind of correcting the record that it was actually the Obama administration
[03:07:17.342 --> 03:07:18.324]  It's all yours, my friend!
[03:07:28.692 --> 03:07:30.013]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:07:30.013 --> 03:07:31.855]  Well, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:31.855 --> 03:07:34.056]  I'm guest hosting Ali Alexander.
[03:07:34.056 --> 03:07:36.358]  You can find me at Twitter, twitter.com slash A-L-I.
[03:07:36.358 --> 03:07:38.580]  I got some pithy thoughts there.
[03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:41.242]  I want to introduce my friend Stephen Franson.
[03:07:41.242 --> 03:07:42.403]  Let me read his bio.
[03:07:42.403 --> 03:07:46.626]  This is kind of awkward when you have to read a friend's bio, but let's bring in Steve Franson.
[03:07:46.626 --> 03:07:53.952]  Steve Franson is a philosopher and author of a book called Rise and Fight, Defeat Globalism and Save the West.
[03:07:53.952 --> 03:07:56.634]  He has a Master's of Arts in Education with Honors.
[03:07:57.154 --> 03:07:59.156]  He was an early investor to Bitcoin.
[03:07:59.156 --> 03:08:03.199]  Steve has been a life coach and consultant since 2014.
[03:08:03.199 --> 03:08:11.344]  His work involves helping people learn about the past, gain crucial empathy, philosophy skills, and finding their purpose in life.
[03:08:11.344 --> 03:08:16.968]  He is passionate about free speech, Western civilization, exercise and diet, and peaceful parenting.
[03:08:16.968 --> 03:08:21.632]  He lives in Montana with his lovely wife, dogs, and newborn baby daughter.
[03:08:21.632 --> 03:08:23.853]  How's the weather there, Steven, in Montana?
[03:08:23.853 --> 03:08:25.815]  Because here in Texas, it's a little warm.
[03:08:27.020 --> 03:08:29.103]  Hey Ali, it's nice and cool.
[03:08:29.103 --> 03:08:30.745]  It's been raining.
[03:08:30.745 --> 03:08:31.546]  It's beautiful here.
[03:08:31.546 --> 03:08:32.367]  I love Montana.
[03:08:32.367 --> 03:08:37.434]  I'm living in the Bitterroot Valley, so I got a beautiful view of all the mountains around me.
[03:08:37.434 --> 03:08:39.457]  Really happy to be out here in Fort Worth today.
[03:08:39.457 --> 03:08:40.218]  How are you, my friend?
[03:08:41.369 --> 03:08:42.590]  I'm doing excellent.
[03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:49.977]  It's always an honor and a privilege when Alex and his awesome team give me the mic and we get to talk about truth.
[03:08:49.977 --> 03:08:56.823]  You know, what I love about the InfoWars team is they're not talking down to me or telling me, okay, Ali, you got to react to the media.
[03:08:56.823 --> 03:09:00.387]  We get to be proactive here and talk about survival skills.
[03:09:00.387 --> 03:09:04.831]  So I knew that when I was going to guest host now, I was like, okay, it's time to introduce
[03:09:05.371 --> 03:09:14.098]  Folks to Steve Franson, Alex, let me share my philosophy of what I think the future looks like and how we could operate more peacefully.
[03:09:14.098 --> 03:09:21.424]  And what I like about you is, is, you know, we share a lot in common and how we see the future, but it differs a little bit.
[03:09:21.424 --> 03:09:23.606]  And this book that you have is very, very timely.
[03:09:23.606 --> 03:09:25.868]  We have to save Western civilization.
[03:09:25.868 --> 03:09:29.191]  We have to defeat these corporatists, these oligarchs.
[03:09:30.171 --> 03:09:34.254]  The bankers, the media, the Hollywood, we got to defeat all of them.
[03:09:34.254 --> 03:09:39.477]  And what I like about, you know, your book is, is, you know, you really tackle some of these issues.
[03:09:39.477 --> 03:09:40.778]  A lot of it's external.
[03:09:40.778 --> 03:09:44.821]  We are at war, but a lot of that war starts with ourselves.
[03:09:44.821 --> 03:09:48.943]  How would you sum up the basis of your, of your book?
[03:09:48.943 --> 03:09:51.305]  What's, you know, what's your thesis behind the entire book?
[03:09:53.132 --> 03:09:55.573]  Basically, I'm the drill sergeant in BASIC.
[03:09:55.573 --> 03:10:00.395]  I'm going to run you through what you need to know as a person who wants to jump into the culture war.
[03:10:00.395 --> 03:10:01.455]  You want to influence people.
[03:10:01.455 --> 03:10:02.416]  You want to reach people.
[03:10:02.416 --> 03:10:04.577]  These are some of the basic principles.
[03:10:04.577 --> 03:10:09.959]  And then also, I have some ideas, I think, of remedies for some of the illnesses of the West right now.
[03:10:10.700 --> 03:10:18.430]  Uh, you know, how to get into a hierarchy, how to form fraternal organizations, how to battle back journalists in the media.
[03:10:18.430 --> 03:10:25.400]  There's different things that I offer in the book that I think are really juicy, really digestible and very effective.
[03:10:26.716 --> 03:10:40.709]  Yeah, and your background isn't, you know, you weren't a political hack like me, you know, for over a decade, you've been working with people and as a life coach and doing psychology and time kind of the studies that can make a man stronger.
[03:10:40.709 --> 03:10:48.636]  And one thing that I loved about, you know, your book, you know, you gave me a copy, it's called, there's a chapter called the quality of fatherliness.
[03:10:48.636 --> 03:10:49.817]  Well, this was your first
[03:10:50.397 --> 03:10:59.948]  Father's Day yesterday with your newborn daughter and you know you and I were talking about how that changed you when you first held your newborn daughter.
[03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:09.418]  What changed in you as a man because you know you you've been somebody who's champion in this philosophy but but what was the experience like and what did that do for your ideas?
[03:11:11.016 --> 03:11:11.276]  Right.
[03:11:11.276 --> 03:11:20.144]  Well, you know, a lot of you don't know me yet, but I spent most of my 20s, I'm 32 now, I spent most of my 20s preparing to be a father, really working on myself.
[03:11:20.144 --> 03:11:24.808]  I saw the value of going to therapy, the value of exploring myself.
[03:11:24.808 --> 03:11:30.013]  If you're familiar with Jordan Peterson's works, I'm definitely in that whole bailiwick.
[03:11:30.013 --> 03:11:32.635]  So holding my daughter for the first time
[03:11:33.787 --> 03:11:38.270]  It was, you know, the scientists say you get a huge drop in testosterone.
[03:11:38.270 --> 03:11:42.053]  And I certainly, I certainly felt like, oh, I'm a father now.
[03:11:42.053 --> 03:11:44.515]  I felt something in my brain change.
[03:11:44.515 --> 03:11:48.118]  I felt myself just mellow out, calm down.
[03:11:48.118 --> 03:11:52.461]  And really, you know, we talked a bit about this in a recent stream.
[03:11:52.461 --> 03:11:55.983]  We talked about ego death and about your pride, you know.
[03:11:55.983 --> 03:11:58.425]  And that's what Kanye is going through right now.
[03:11:58.425 --> 03:11:59.786]  That's what Kanye is going through right now.
[03:12:00.279 --> 03:12:01.822]  I experienced that myself too.
[03:12:01.822 --> 03:12:04.666]  I just felt this like changeover, complete changeover.
[03:12:04.666 --> 03:12:13.540]  So do you think that that's kind of a natural byproduct of becoming a father is some of this ego death?
[03:12:15.174 --> 03:12:20.255]  Yeah, I would say so, because you really have to stop thinking about everything in terms of yourself.
[03:12:20.255 --> 03:12:26.697]  You stop formulating in terms of what's best for me, what's most convenient for me, what is going to serve me here in the near future.
[03:12:26.697 --> 03:12:28.077]  You have to think of the far future.
[03:12:28.077 --> 03:12:29.738]  You have to think decades ahead.
[03:12:29.738 --> 03:12:32.098]  I like to think generations ahead.
[03:12:32.098 --> 03:12:38.360]  I also wrote a chapter in one of my books recently called Dynasty and Hegemony, where I talk about really setting up
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:49.246]  An intergenerational sort of path for your family, really setting a new way in this information age that we have to be able to have your family set up far into the future.
[03:12:49.246 --> 03:12:52.728]  So I think that's a huge way that your formulations really change.
[03:12:52.728 --> 03:12:54.929]  And I certainly have made that change.
[03:12:54.929 --> 03:13:00.372]  I think of everything in terms of what's best for my daughter, what's best for my family, how am I going to do this?
[03:13:00.372 --> 03:13:01.893]  What are the optics on this?
[03:13:01.893 --> 03:13:03.073]  What's the empathy here?
[03:13:03.073 --> 03:13:05.775]  What do I need to handle in order to make things best for them?
[03:13:06.716 --> 03:13:08.717]  Yeah, and I like that.
[03:13:08.717 --> 03:13:14.700]  So tell the audience about this chapter in your book, the quality of fatherliness.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:22.645]  Kind of give us an overview of what's behind that quality.
[03:13:22.645 --> 03:13:22.845]  Sure.
[03:13:22.845 --> 03:13:28.148]  Well, I named a few different things in the essay, but first and foremost is protectiveness.
[03:13:28.148 --> 03:13:31.470]  You really want to practice protectiveness as a father.
[03:13:31.470 --> 03:13:31.970]  You are
[03:13:32.984 --> 03:13:37.625]  Really the immune system for your family as a father and especially for your children.
[03:13:37.625 --> 03:13:42.367]  You know, children who grow up without fathers, you know, girls start puberty earlier.
[03:13:42.367 --> 03:13:45.187]  They are prone to more sexual activity.
[03:13:45.187 --> 03:13:50.509]  Boys who are without fathers, they are prone, they are more involved in mass shootings.
[03:13:50.509 --> 03:13:54.090]  I think 95% of the mass shooters had father issues.
[03:13:54.090 --> 03:13:55.910]  They had absent fathers.
[03:13:55.910 --> 03:14:01.192]  You're also more prone to volatility, inability to control your emotions and stuff like this.
[03:14:01.932 --> 03:14:06.875]  Really, you want to be the immune system for your family, and that is really encapsulated in protectiveness.
[03:14:06.875 --> 03:14:09.097]  And I also talk about providing.
[03:14:09.097 --> 03:14:10.137]  Providing is huge.
[03:14:10.137 --> 03:14:19.243]  Providing is, you know, all the success, industry combined, everything you need to know about real estate, everything you need to know about networking, all this stuff.
[03:14:19.243 --> 03:14:24.446]  It really hooks into this fundamental drive we have as fathers to really provide for our children.
[03:14:24.446 --> 03:14:28.368]  So, you really are the psychological backbone for the family as a father.
[03:14:28.368 --> 03:14:30.650]  And of course, we live in a time where fatherhood
[03:14:31.417 --> 03:14:35.421]  Yeah, it's really a shame and I tell my readers and my viewers on Periscope this all the time is that, you know, we
[03:14:49.045 --> 03:15:06.776]  as a western civilization have imploded more than we've been invaded and you know the war is on multiple fronts and you know what I like about what I like about some of your work is it it does kind of evoke Jordan Peterson it's like clean your room and it's like find purpose and he talks
[03:15:07.216 --> 03:15:13.281]  You know, Dr. Peterson talks about all these emails that he gets from young men saying, I found my purpose, thank you so much.
[03:15:13.281 --> 03:15:22.788]  Or Stefan Molyneux, you know, who hearkens back to some of these age-old principles that will keep us a healthy and a stable society.
[03:15:22.788 --> 03:15:28.113]  We're about to go to break, but when we come back, Stephen, I want to talk about some of these qualities
[03:15:28.835 --> 03:15:37.879]  That men need to learn and some of these qualities that they can implement immediately to become the alpha, the protector of their homes and their families.
[03:15:37.879 --> 03:15:39.900]  It's going to be very, very awesome.
[03:15:39.900 --> 03:15:42.801]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.

[03:15:46.263 --> 03:15:48.224]  We'll be back on the other side of the break.
[03:15:53.464 --> 03:15:55.326]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.326 --> 03:16:03.932]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:20:05.951 --> 03:20:18.220]  Take people and you expose them to things that they are avoiding.
[03:20:18.220 --> 03:20:22.283]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:25.652 --> 03:20:32.195]  If for 10 years you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do.
[03:20:32.195 --> 03:20:32.835]  I love that.
[03:20:32.835 --> 03:20:33.896]  You know what that is?
[03:20:33.896 --> 03:20:35.637]  That's what the kids call a banger.
[03:20:35.637 --> 03:20:36.737]  It's called a banger.
[03:20:36.737 --> 03:20:42.180]  That type of synthwave EDM that has some audio stuff in it.
[03:20:42.180 --> 03:20:45.502]  You know, I'm 32 but now I'm sounding like a boomer myself.
[03:20:45.502 --> 03:20:48.983]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:20:48.983 --> 03:20:52.365]  I am hosting for this last hour and it's a privilege and an honor to do so.
[03:20:52.745 --> 03:20:54.286]  I'm Ali Alexander.
[03:20:54.286 --> 03:20:57.989]  You can find me on YouTube and the onlines.
[03:20:57.989 --> 03:21:00.011]  I'm joined by my friend Steve Franson.
[03:21:00.011 --> 03:21:08.918]  We're going over a list, but that song, that song, Steven, you've seen, it's a band called, it's a DJ duo called Milk and Cooks.
[03:21:10.039 --> 03:21:14.341]  That's an unreleased song, so that was an exclusive here for InfoWars.
[03:21:14.341 --> 03:21:20.365]  And they were actually at Mike Cernovich's A Night for Freedom, both his DC and New York party.
[03:21:20.365 --> 03:21:24.307]  And I know that you're into some synthwave stuff, Steven.
[03:21:24.307 --> 03:21:26.008]  Was that a nice tease for you?
[03:21:26.008 --> 03:21:26.709]  How did that sound?
[03:21:27.853 --> 03:21:29.915]  That was a nice tease.
[03:21:29.915 --> 03:21:31.236]  I love the synthwave stuff.
[03:21:31.236 --> 03:21:32.877]  I love what Milk and Cooks have done.
[03:21:32.877 --> 03:21:34.238]  I was able to catch them with you.
[03:21:34.238 --> 03:21:38.962]  I went to a Night for Freedom in New York City and I thought they did an incredible job.
[03:21:38.962 --> 03:21:40.503]  They had dancers.
[03:21:40.503 --> 03:21:42.485]  These guys are pure swag.
[03:21:42.485 --> 03:21:43.986]  So Milk and Cooks, that's a great plug.
[03:21:44.685 --> 03:21:51.088]  Yeah, they're these beautiful, blonde, bulky twins out of Chicago, and what's funny is I'm gonna out them.
[03:21:51.088 --> 03:22:04.495]  I hope that the mainstream media doesn't record this, but sometimes what they say that they'll do in their shows with 20 or more thousand people is they'll play little clips of Alex Jones kind of putting it into the zeitgeist.
[03:22:04.495 --> 03:22:05.796]  We're everywhere, folks!
[03:22:05.796 --> 03:22:08.517]  The Info Warriors, the True Resistance,
[03:22:09.157 --> 03:22:10.738]  We're truly, truly everywhere.
[03:22:10.738 --> 03:22:17.681]  What I want to do is I want to get back into this chapter, the quality of fatherliness in your book titled Rise and Fight.
[03:22:17.681 --> 03:22:20.203]  People can order that already on Amazon.
[03:22:20.203 --> 03:22:27.126]  In this, you say, a man can build up his ability to serve as a protector to his family in any of the following ways.
[03:22:27.126 --> 03:22:28.286]  So we're going to give you this list.
[03:22:28.286 --> 03:22:30.968]  If you're at home, you want to be writing this down right now.
[03:22:30.968 --> 03:22:33.249]  If you're listening via radio, you want to pull over.
[03:22:33.982 --> 03:22:39.585]  The first way you say is owning guns, practicing gun safety and target accuracy.
[03:22:39.585 --> 03:22:53.353]  The second thing you say is maintaining physical fitness such that a violent attack from an outgroup assailant could be met with lethal force if necessary, if lawful and if necessary.
[03:22:53.353 --> 03:23:01.838]  The third you say is practicing situational awareness in all environments where a man's family will or can be.
[03:23:03.039 --> 03:23:08.605]  Next you say, owning a trained guard dog or guard dog breed.
[03:23:08.605 --> 03:23:11.087]  Wow, I'm like tripping over my words right now.
[03:23:11.087 --> 03:23:14.431]  Next you say, choosing a safe neighborhood for one's family to live in.
[03:23:14.431 --> 03:23:15.372]  This is very important.
[03:23:15.372 --> 03:23:24.402]  My mother was a single mother and the single best decision she made was making sure that we got in a good neighborhood with a good school district
[03:23:24.862 --> 03:23:32.791]  And that allowed us opportunities to choose our path in life where so many get trapped in this urban environment of decay.
[03:23:32.791 --> 03:23:43.322]  And then lastly, you say exercising good taste and psychological judiciousness in terms of the people and information a man allows into his home.
[03:23:43.322 --> 03:23:46.486]  I talk about this for hours every week on my Periscope that
[03:23:47.006 --> 03:23:53.067]  The media is literally speech control so that they can control your thoughts.
[03:23:53.067 --> 03:24:08.131]  If they add the adjectives, you know, controversial for Republicans and then they say, oh, watch this powerful speech from, you know, the rapist Bill Clinton, the alleged rapist Bill Clinton, which I totally think he did it, folks.
[03:24:08.131 --> 03:24:12.632]  But, you know, then it kind of already sets the frame, if you will.
[03:24:12.632 --> 03:24:13.952]  Scott Adams talks about this.
[03:24:14.632 --> 03:24:17.893]  And so this list, you know, how practical is this list?
[03:24:17.893 --> 03:24:29.757]  Is there anything else you would tell men who are fathers that, you know, this is what you immediately can do right now, right now, right now, right now, if you want to become the alpha protector of your home?
[03:24:29.757 --> 03:24:29.937]  Right.
[03:24:29.937 --> 03:24:33.958]  Well, something else that I really stress, and I have stressed for years, is cultivate sobriety.
[03:24:34.788 --> 03:24:41.276]  I'm not talking about go full T-Total or anything like this, but really know what you want to do with your life.
[03:24:41.276 --> 03:24:49.686]  Really cultivate a straight edge, really some kind of focus so that you understand how it is that you're going to manifest your meaning in this life.
[03:24:50.086 --> 03:24:51.707]  How are you going to expand out?
[03:24:51.707 --> 03:24:54.567]  How are you going to conquer the physical world?
[03:24:54.567 --> 03:24:56.708]  How are you going to be present for your family?
[03:24:56.708 --> 03:24:59.489]  That's all about being sober, being focused, and being aware.
[03:24:59.489 --> 03:25:01.029]  So it really has a lot to do with mindset.
[03:25:01.029 --> 03:25:09.792]  That's why we see a lot of the mindset industry really taking off because they're really looking for answers and they're really looking, how can I get to that next level?
[03:25:09.792 --> 03:25:11.273]  How can I even start a family?
[03:25:11.273 --> 03:25:12.533]  How can I even get a woman
[03:25:13.093 --> 03:25:13.874]  How can I keep this?
[03:25:13.874 --> 03:25:15.595]  How can I maintain it?
[03:25:15.595 --> 03:25:20.377]  I really think that has a lot to do with sobriety, really knowing yourself and staying consistent over time.
[03:25:20.377 --> 03:25:21.938]  Certainly that's how I've done it.
[03:25:21.938 --> 03:25:23.399]  I'm reaping the rewards.
[03:25:23.399 --> 03:25:25.500]  I live in a great place here in Montana.
[03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:27.121]  I've done all those things on that list.
[03:25:27.121 --> 03:25:27.962]  I've got my guns.
[03:25:27.962 --> 03:25:29.082]  I got my dog.
[03:25:29.082 --> 03:25:29.783]  I got my wife.
[03:25:29.783 --> 03:25:30.523]  I got my friends.
[03:25:30.523 --> 03:25:31.804]  I got everything lined up.
[03:25:31.804 --> 03:25:33.385]  And so that's what I offer to people.
[03:25:33.385 --> 03:25:34.906]  I'm really living the message.
[03:25:34.906 --> 03:25:37.027]  And a lot of that has to do with my living clean.
[03:25:37.955 --> 03:25:39.236]  You know, a lot of people don't know this.
[03:25:39.236 --> 03:25:46.259]  In marketing, you know, because I've been doing political marketing for 11 years, you have the user and the buyer.
[03:25:46.259 --> 03:25:49.040]  The user may not always be the buyer.
[03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:56.664]  For example, men's underwear, it's something like 70 to 80 percent of men's underwear is actually purchased by women.
[03:25:56.664 --> 03:26:02.706]  So it's used by men, but women make the purchases, which is why advertisements look the way they do.
[03:26:02.706 --> 03:26:03.847]  They're more glowing.
[03:26:04.768 --> 03:26:06.509]  You know, there's some hair in there.
[03:26:06.509 --> 03:26:19.039]  There's not, you know, women are looking for a certain type of, you know, idealistic picture, you know, a meme, if you will, that they want to, that they want to see their man in.
[03:26:19.039 --> 03:26:21.321]  And so then that's what the man ends up wearing.
[03:26:21.321 --> 03:26:25.845]  What's your message to women about this book and in particular this chapter?
[03:26:25.845 --> 03:26:27.366]  You know, what's the sell for women?
[03:26:27.366 --> 03:26:30.189]  Why do they need to also promote good,
[03:26:30.876 --> 03:26:38.319]  You know, good fatherhood, you know, stay at home, not stay at home fathers, but present fathers.
[03:26:38.319 --> 03:26:38.519]  Right.
[03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:50.563]  Well, if you don't want, I mean, you don't want all the bad things to happen to your kids that are markers of lack of fatherhood, then you're going to want to be one of those women that really encourages a man to be strong, a man to do what is right.
[03:26:50.563 --> 03:26:52.743]  I mean, that's really the sell is that it's a win-win.
[03:26:52.743 --> 03:26:54.604]  You know, I'm all about win-wins.
[03:26:54.604 --> 03:26:57.345]  I've really learned that that's how you have to handle it in society.
[03:26:57.725 --> 03:26:59.006]  That's how we're going to save the West.
[03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:17.278]  We're good.
[03:27:35.638 --> 03:27:36.659]  I'm in full agreement.
[03:27:36.659 --> 03:27:49.108]  So I think it's a pretty easy sell, but it's a matter of, as Jordan Peterson was saying right before we came back on, he was saying you've got to make people aware of what they've been in denial of, what they've been afraid of admitting to themselves.
[03:27:49.108 --> 03:28:01.217]  So there really are a lot of women out there that if they could really just admit it to themselves for one second, what it would be like to have a great man around or a great father, what kind of joy that would bring, I think that's the sell right there.
[03:28:02.017 --> 03:28:05.220]  That's the sell the book is rise and fight.
[03:28:05.220 --> 03:28:07.723]  That's if you want to defeat the globalists.
[03:28:07.723 --> 03:28:14.590]  If you want to fight to save the best parts of Western civilization, I still say that there's some parts that suck.
[03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:17.894]  There's some parts, you know, the decisions that are the downfall of the West.
[03:28:18.374 --> 03:28:20.896]  We're determined by the West.
[03:28:20.896 --> 03:28:22.597]  Steve, I'm so glad that you joined us.
[03:28:22.597 --> 03:28:23.778]  We'll have to have you back again.
[03:28:23.778 --> 03:28:29.762]  I know that Alex wants a lot more philosophy here on InfoWars because we have to equip people.
[03:28:29.762 --> 03:28:32.524]  I think this is why people are buying supplements at the InfoWars store.
[03:28:32.524 --> 03:28:35.546]  I think that this is why people are getting into mindset.
[03:28:35.546 --> 03:28:37.167]  Thanks so much for joining us.
[03:28:37.167 --> 03:28:43.191]  We're about to hop on to a break and then talk about the border, but thank you, Steve and Franson.
[03:28:43.191 --> 03:28:44.092]  Thanks for having me, Ali.

[03:30:07.253 --> 03:30:10.215]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.585 --> 03:30:26.066]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[03:30:54.287 --> 03:30:56.628]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:30:56.628 --> 03:30:58.788]  We're really, really proud of it.

[03:31:54.184 --> 03:31:58.146]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.146 --> 03:32:01.427]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.427 --> 03:32:07.690]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.690 --> 03:32:10.472]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.192 --> 03:32:15.018]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.018 --> 03:32:21.508]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.508 --> 03:32:26.475]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.216 --> 03:32:31.139]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.139 --> 03:32:38.323]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.323 --> 03:32:43.547]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.547 --> 03:32:49.250]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:53.213]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.194 --> 03:32:59.808]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.022 --> 03:33:22.387]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.387 --> 03:33:24.110]  We're here on InfoWars.
[03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:26.673]  I'm guest hosting this last hour for Alex.
[03:33:26.673 --> 03:33:32.582]  We just wrapped up an awesome 30 minutes with Steve Franson in which we talked about the importance of fatherhood.
[03:33:33.488 --> 03:33:39.952]  Uh, and not just from the perspective of a man, but also the perspective of a woman and how we can save the West.
[03:33:39.952 --> 03:33:48.298]  And that half hour was focused on what we could do internally, but externally, we're facing still great threats to the West.
[03:33:48.298 --> 03:33:56.663]  And so I wanted to spend this last half hour separating fact from fiction, because even me, someone who does this political stuff full time, I have
[03:33:57.183 --> 03:34:01.128]  Troubles separating fact from fiction when it comes to this border crisis.
[03:34:01.128 --> 03:34:02.850]  Are we caging children?
[03:34:02.850 --> 03:34:03.631]  Are we not?
[03:34:03.631 --> 03:34:06.675]  Are the Democrats in the media lying or aren't they?
[03:34:06.675 --> 03:34:09.318]  Where are the Republicans on this issue?
[03:34:09.318 --> 03:34:14.424]  So I knew I had to bring on one of the, you know, actually he is the best in the business on the border.
[03:34:14.424 --> 03:34:16.227]  Brandon Darby is the editor.
[03:34:17.167 --> 03:34:18.808]  At Breitbart, Texas.
[03:34:18.808 --> 03:34:22.450]  I don't have a bio to read for him because we've known each other so long.
[03:34:22.450 --> 03:34:28.633]  He was mentored by Andrew Breitbart himself, one of the last originals from those heydays.
[03:34:28.633 --> 03:34:32.014]  A good friend of mine, a good friend of the movement, and a good friend of truth.
[03:34:32.014 --> 03:34:34.575]  I mean, he does not, he doesn't toe a line.
[03:34:34.575 --> 03:34:39.778]  He has the Cartel Chronicles over there at Breitbart, Texas, and he doesn't toe the line.
[03:34:39.778 --> 03:34:41.879]  But Brandon, thanks for making time for us today.
[03:34:43.473 --> 03:34:44.875]  Hey Ali, thanks for having me on.
[03:34:44.875 --> 03:34:48.338]  I appreciate it, and yeah, I'm glad to be on.
[03:34:48.338 --> 03:34:49.860]  I think it's really important.
[03:34:49.860 --> 03:35:02.633]  There's a lot of information swirling around, a lot of misinformation, a lot of mischaracterized information, and I think it's important that all groups, you know, hear what's going on and have a discussion about it.
[03:35:03.723 --> 03:35:14.566]  Yeah, that's what I'm all about, and I think that that's this new age that, you know, whether you like Donald Trump or you don't, whether you like Kanye West or you don't, this is something Andrew would want, is everyone talking to everyone.
[03:35:14.566 --> 03:35:16.087]  So thanks for joining us.
[03:35:16.087 --> 03:35:20.648]  I want to ask you a bunch of stupid questions, and then you tell us what's fact or fiction.
[03:35:20.648 --> 03:35:25.709]  Are there children presently in, you know, cage-like jails right now?
[03:35:25.709 --> 03:35:28.410]  Yes.
[03:35:28.410 --> 03:35:29.190]  And why is that?
[03:35:31.741 --> 03:35:32.525]  Yeah.
[03:35:32.525 --> 03:35:33.670]  Okay, so this is where...
[03:35:34.440 --> 03:35:44.346]  You know, and again, some of the listeners, I'm sure, are not going to appreciate some of what I have to say, but I'm going to say it.
[03:35:44.346 --> 03:36:01.716]  There's a lot of stuff that's said about what's happening at the border, a lot of stuff that goes on at the border that the truth is actually horrifying enough, especially in Tamaulipas, south of Texas, and then Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, these three Mexican states immediately south of Texas.
[03:36:04.217 --> 03:36:07.660]  But a lot of the things that people get carried away on are just not true.
[03:36:07.660 --> 03:36:18.028]  Like, you know, a lot of, and I'm not trying to be ugly, but I do think Infowars, I might have participated in it, with this like child sex trafficking camp in Tucson.
[03:36:18.028 --> 03:36:19.890]  You know, I looked into that and it just wasn't true.
[03:36:20.650 --> 03:36:22.591]  And, you know, there's a lot of things.
[03:36:22.591 --> 03:36:32.137]  The thing about, you know, the training camp in Juarez outside of El Paso for ISIS, that just wasn't true.
[03:36:32.137 --> 03:36:35.439]  And there's a lot of these things that we get carried away.
[03:36:36.820 --> 03:36:41.484]  You know, and rabbit trails we go down, they're just not helpful.
[03:36:41.484 --> 03:36:51.351]  You know, they're just not helpful to the cause, they're not helpful to the cause of securing the border, or if your cause is just bringing more attention to what goes on in the border region, right?
[03:36:51.351 --> 03:36:52.632]  They're just not helpful.
[03:36:52.632 --> 03:37:00.977]  So being on here is very important to me because I can, you know, I do think that there's a lot of important things that come from InfoWars.
[03:37:02.018 --> 03:37:02.999]  Absolutely.
[03:37:02.999 --> 03:37:06.802]  And I think it's very, very important that you're there.
[03:37:06.802 --> 03:37:11.846]  You know, all outlets have made mistakes, and it happens.
[03:37:11.846 --> 03:37:17.691]  So that said, and that squared away, let's talk about what really goes on.
[03:37:17.691 --> 03:37:28.539]  You know, as most of the Infowars listeners probably know, because I think they generally stay very informed about border issues and sovereignty issues, the U.S.-Mexico border is roughly 2,000 miles long.
[03:37:29.995 --> 03:37:35.658]  That 2,000 mile long border has nine border patrol sectors, okay?
[03:37:35.658 --> 03:37:38.139]  Texas has five of those sectors.
[03:37:38.139 --> 03:37:41.981]  Now, three of those sectors are
[03:37:42.845 --> 03:37:43.545]  I think so.
[03:38:02.476 --> 03:38:04.697]  That's something a lot of people don't realize.
[03:38:04.697 --> 03:38:06.178]  Like human trafficking?
[03:38:06.178 --> 03:38:07.558]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:38:07.558 --> 03:38:08.899]  No, not human trafficking.
[03:38:08.899 --> 03:38:11.940]  Some of it's human trafficking, but human smuggling, right?
[03:38:11.940 --> 03:38:15.042]  So people who voluntarily enter the situation.
[03:38:15.042 --> 03:38:23.985]  And so people need to understand this, that all of those nine sectors on the border are controlled by different Mexican cartels, and they all have different M.O.s.
[03:38:23.985 --> 03:38:27.567]  They all have different personalities and types and ways that they do business.
[03:38:28.087 --> 03:38:37.135]  As you move west along the border towards California, and through California, those Mexican cartel groups tend to be much more professional.
[03:38:37.135 --> 03:38:46.042]  They tend to make sure that their violence doesn't implicate or doesn't hurt as many innocent bystanders as... You said as we move west?
[03:38:46.042 --> 03:38:46.802]  As you move west.
[03:38:46.802 --> 03:38:53.508]  But now when you get below Texas, specifically the Rio Grande Valley sector, the Laredo sector, and the Del Rio sector,
[03:38:54.587 --> 03:38:57.523]  That's Los Zetas and that's the Gulf Cartel.
[03:38:57.523 --> 03:38:58.508]  Now those two groups...
[03:38:59.406 --> 03:39:02.607]  They tend to be a lot more ruthless with average citizens.
[03:39:02.607 --> 03:39:05.048]  Their violence does affect other people.
[03:39:05.048 --> 03:39:10.050]  And they tend to make decisions that don't care about, necessarily care about tomorrow.
[03:39:10.050 --> 03:39:19.493]  That's why when we had the migrant crisis in 2014, you saw the influxes largely in the Rio Grande Valley sector and the Laredo sector and the Del Rio sector.
[03:39:19.493 --> 03:39:24.555]  It was in the area controlled by the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, because they didn't care about tomorrow.
[03:39:24.555 --> 03:39:27.536]  The Sinaloa Cartel out West, they said, hey, wait a minute.
[03:39:27.996 --> 03:39:37.058]  If we put all these kids going through, we're going to make a lot of money doing it, but it's going to increase the law enforcement presence, which is going to hurt us in the long term.
[03:39:37.058 --> 03:39:40.419]  It's going to hurt our profits in the long term, so we're not going to do it.
[03:39:40.419 --> 03:39:42.099]  We're not going to let them cross.
[03:39:42.099 --> 03:39:46.640]  Well, that's why most people tend to cross in the Rio Grande Valley sector.
[03:39:46.640 --> 03:39:49.141]  Where it's more dangerous.
[03:39:49.141 --> 03:39:53.542]  And it is much more dangerous because those criminal groups don't care about tomorrow.
[03:39:54.142 --> 03:40:04.684]  So if you imagine, if they don't care about tomorrow, they're much more likely to do things that are more violent, more extreme, not care if they hurt innocent people.
[03:40:04.684 --> 03:40:07.945]  So this is the context this all fits within.
[03:40:07.945 --> 03:40:17.627]  So now, when people leave Central America, and they're on their journey to the U.S., the majority of women from Central America are sexually assaulted along that journey.
[03:40:18.237 --> 03:40:19.159]  Brandon, can I interrupt you?
[03:40:28.380 --> 03:40:31.402]  This is my problem with what I think the media is trying to do.
[03:40:31.402 --> 03:40:39.548]  They're trying to get President Trump and the DHS to say, OK, we're going to release parents when they show up with their children.
[03:40:39.548 --> 03:40:45.572]  We're not going to implement this zero tolerance policy that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had.
[03:40:45.572 --> 03:40:54.018]  And what that's going to actually do is encourage more women and children to participate in this system of sex, drugs and assault.
[03:40:54.018 --> 03:40:55.579]  And that's something I don't want.
[03:40:56.661 --> 03:40:59.463]  Well, right, so I'll get there.
[03:40:59.463 --> 03:41:05.508]  So the bottom line is that no one crosses that border without paying a cartel.
[03:41:06.481 --> 03:41:07.422]  It just doesn't happen.
[03:41:07.422 --> 03:41:11.465]  You pay the cartel and you continue to make payments to the cartel.
[03:41:11.465 --> 03:41:14.948]  If your child is crossing, then the family is paying the cartel.
[03:41:14.948 --> 03:41:20.553]  I mean, we could go down the whole list of litany of issues, but nobody just crosses.
[03:41:20.553 --> 03:41:26.538]  It isn't like a guy in the mountains in Guatemala is like, hey, I'm going to make a journey and work and better my life.
[03:41:26.538 --> 03:41:27.919]  No, he has to get an agent.
[03:41:27.919 --> 03:41:31.542]  That agent has to deal with the Mexican, the transnational criminal group.
[03:41:31.542 --> 03:41:33.224]  That group works out a price.
[03:41:34.005 --> 03:41:38.111]  Uh, and then that guy agrees to make payments, and if he doesn't, his family gets killed.
[03:41:38.111 --> 03:41:43.459]  But he willfully enters that situation trying to find work in the US, right?
[03:41:43.459 --> 03:41:46.023]  So there's a lot of complicated to it.
[03:41:46.023 --> 03:41:49.248]  But the bottom line is, when people cross the border,
[03:41:50.012 --> 03:41:52.474]  And they're arrested and apprehended.
[03:41:52.474 --> 03:41:56.657]  The same thing that happens to me and you happens to them.
[03:41:56.657 --> 03:42:03.342]  If I'm driving down the road in my car and I don't pay a speeding ticket and I have a warrant for my arrest, I'm gonna get pulled over.
[03:42:03.342 --> 03:42:07.545]  When I get pulled over, the cop is gonna say, you have a warrant for your arrest, I have to arrest you.
[03:42:07.545 --> 03:42:10.787]  And then I'm gonna say, wait, I have my child in the car.
[03:42:11.770 --> 03:42:15.353]  And the cop isn't, he's not going to say no.
[03:42:15.353 --> 03:42:17.074]  In that case, I can't arrest you.
[03:42:17.074 --> 03:42:17.794]  Go on.
[03:42:17.794 --> 03:42:18.695]  No, he's going to go.
[03:42:18.695 --> 03:42:21.877]  Do you have a family member nearby you can call?
[03:42:21.877 --> 03:42:30.303]  And if I say no, then he's going to call social services and social services is going to pick up my child until I'm not in jail.
[03:42:30.303 --> 03:42:31.144]  That's what's going to happen.
[03:42:31.144 --> 03:42:33.746]  They're not going to put my daughter in a jail cell.
[03:42:33.746 --> 03:42:34.326]  Yeah.
[03:42:34.326 --> 03:42:34.907]  I'll wait around.
[03:42:35.692 --> 03:42:37.433]  Yeah, thanks for hanging on.
[03:42:37.433 --> 03:42:42.374]  Brandon Darby, the editor of Breitbart Texas, he's separating fact from fiction.
[03:42:42.374 --> 03:42:44.955]  On the other side of the break, we're going to talk about these children.
[03:42:44.955 --> 03:42:51.677]  We're going to talk about the system the media endorses that leads to this sex stuff, this drug stuff, and this violence stuff.
[03:42:51.677 --> 03:42:52.857]  I don't like it at all, people.
[03:42:53.390 --> 03:42:55.711]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:44:55.208 --> 03:45:03.750]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:07.231]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[03:45:07.231 --> 03:45:16.774]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[03:45:16.774 --> 03:45:23.176]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being
[03:45:23.336 --> 03:45:23.836]  I think so.
[03:45:53.656 --> 03:46:00.038]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:46:00.038 --> 03:46:03.239]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:46:03.239 --> 03:46:06.940]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:46:06.940 --> 03:46:11.642]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:46:11.642 --> 03:46:14.923]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:46:15.823 --> 03:46:26.810]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:46:26.810 --> 03:46:35.336]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:46:36.977 --> 03:46:38.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.407 --> 03:47:21.519]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:47:21.519 --> 03:47:24.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.411 --> 03:47:29.532]  This is Milk and Cooks.
[03:47:29.532 --> 03:47:35.056]  Milk and Cooks, this song is not yet released, so it's an exclusive here on InfoWars.
[03:47:35.056 --> 03:47:37.417]  I'm so privileged to be closing out the hour.
[03:47:37.417 --> 03:47:40.199]  I am your host, Ali Alexander.
[03:47:40.199 --> 03:47:50.767]  We have on the phone one of my dearest friends in the conservative movement, in the political movement, in the movement to restore individuals, to keep nations sovereign, Brandon Darby from Breitbart, Texas.
[03:47:50.767 --> 03:47:53.128]  You know what I will say is this is what I love.
[03:47:53.128 --> 03:47:54.009]  What I love is that
[03:47:54.713 --> 03:48:19.661]  With Breitbart and InfoWars, I can have an honest discussion where I can ask any question I want and we will push out corrections, we will push out retractions, because Lord knows there's not enough money on the Breitbart side or the InfoWars side to keep journalism funded like the multi-billion dollar mainstream media, lamestream media, you know, kind of apparatus.
[03:48:19.661 --> 03:48:21.842]  They're not covering these stories that Brandon is.
[03:48:26.786 --> 03:48:40.377]  Brandon, you were talking about these children and how the same thing that would happen to you or I, you know, I don't have, I'm an uncle, but I'm not a father, but if you were with your daughter and you got pulled over,
[03:48:41.149 --> 03:48:45.331]  They would separate you from your child because you would be detained.
[03:48:45.331 --> 03:48:47.752]  And why should we put children in adult prisons?
[03:48:47.752 --> 03:48:53.795]  It seems like a toxic argument that the media is trying to make for political purposes.
[03:48:53.795 --> 03:48:56.296]  Like they have a policy goal at the end of this.
[03:48:56.296 --> 03:48:56.836]  Is that true?
[03:48:58.635 --> 03:49:00.577]  I would say that's accurate.
[03:49:00.577 --> 03:49:03.098]  That's how I look at it.
[03:49:03.098 --> 03:49:05.500]  And that's what I was trying to explain earlier.
[03:49:05.500 --> 03:49:11.683]  So when people first come across the border and they get arrested, they get put into a holding facility.
[03:49:11.683 --> 03:49:17.587]  If you get put into a holding facility and there's mass numbers of people, they can't have a Hilton hotel room.
[03:49:18.406 --> 03:49:22.050]  Uh, for everyone who gets arrested at the border.
[03:49:22.050 --> 03:49:35.843]  So what happens is they put them in a large room, and because some people are good people and some people are bad people, some people are five years old and some people are 30 or 50, um, what they do is they separate them with chain link.
[03:49:35.843 --> 03:49:40.067]  They have dividers in between people, so it's done to protect people.
[03:49:40.647 --> 03:49:46.809]  I don't really know another way that it could be done, and that is a temporary situation.
[03:49:46.809 --> 03:49:56.832]  If it's a child, they don't stay there long, and then they're taken by human services, and then they're put into a nicer facility that resembles a group home for children.
[03:49:56.832 --> 03:49:58.752]  So when you say, are there people in cages?
[03:49:58.752 --> 03:49:59.472]  Yes, there are.
[03:49:59.472 --> 03:50:00.453]  Are there kids?
[03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:01.453]  Initially, there are, yes.
[03:50:02.653 --> 03:50:11.536]  They're in rooms that are with chain-link dividers between them and other individuals for the child's safety.
[03:50:11.536 --> 03:50:12.717]  Is that ideal?
[03:50:12.717 --> 03:50:14.497]  No.
[03:50:14.497 --> 03:50:15.618]  Do I think that's horrible?
[03:50:15.618 --> 03:50:16.498]  Yes, I do.
[03:50:16.498 --> 03:50:18.599]  Do I think there's another way to do it?
[03:50:18.599 --> 03:50:20.599]  No, I really don't.
[03:50:20.599 --> 03:50:28.622]  I can't think of another way to do it unless you use bars or unless you use concrete blocks, in which case then they'd be putting kids in cells, right?
[03:50:29.042 --> 03:50:31.224]  So, what do you do?
[03:50:31.224 --> 03:50:53.944]  So, if you look at what's occurred, many years ago in the Bush years, a lot of folks in Austin, where I think the largest Infowars base is, that's where Infowars is based, a lot of folks remember people protesting in Huddo at the Huddo Family Detention Center, Immigration Detention Center, and the left demanded that those family detention centers be shut down.
[03:50:54.617 --> 03:50:55.218]  Well, you know what?
[03:50:55.218 --> 03:50:58.021]  The family detention centers were shut down.
[03:50:58.021 --> 03:51:03.327]  And now the left is demanding that people don't be held independently.
[03:51:03.327 --> 03:51:11.616]  If you can't hold people as a family, and you can't hold people individually, so in other words,
[03:51:12.276 --> 03:51:13.637]  Don't hold anyone.
[03:51:13.637 --> 03:51:17.319]  Just allow everyone in the world who wants to come to come and stay in America.
[03:51:17.319 --> 03:51:18.740]  That's not a good situation.
[03:51:18.740 --> 03:51:25.783]  And if the policy is that anyone with a child gets to come and stay and doesn't get detained, everyone who comes will bring a child.
[03:51:25.783 --> 03:51:29.545]  And this is not a good situation that's sustainable.
[03:51:29.545 --> 03:51:30.926]  Milton Friedman talked about this.
[03:51:30.926 --> 03:51:35.868]  You can't have open borders and have a system of entitlements and a social net.
[03:51:35.868 --> 03:51:36.689]  You can't have both.
[03:51:37.029 --> 03:51:38.570]  It's not sustainable.
[03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:39.770]  It's not sustainable.
[03:51:39.770 --> 03:51:43.772]  The only people that I see it sustaining is the cartels.
[03:51:43.772 --> 03:51:48.634]  And, you know, Brandon, I was reading your article, you know, on Breitbart Texas last night.
[03:51:48.634 --> 03:51:52.176]  You know, these chain link partitions is what I would call them.
[03:51:52.176 --> 03:51:53.737]  And that's what you guys called them.
[03:51:53.737 --> 03:51:58.719]  And I was thinking, is, you know, this allows officers
[03:51:59.359 --> 03:52:01.200]  To see what's going on.
[03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:09.243]  You know, they can't build these permanent institutions that would cost us billions and billions of dollars that would essentially be jail cells.
[03:52:09.243 --> 03:52:10.924]  But instead, this is like triage.
[03:52:10.924 --> 03:52:14.465]  When you go to the hospital, the nurse performs triage.
[03:52:14.465 --> 03:52:18.707]  She decides who goes what, where, how soon someone needs attention.
[03:52:18.707 --> 03:52:20.968]  In jail, it's called booking or processing.
[03:52:21.408 --> 03:52:36.533]  And unfortunately, this is just a part of the process, but it's the easiest, I think, fastest, safest way to get into a situation where they can monitor the entire situation, make sure no one's being bullied, and then like you said, then they're put into a type of foster care situation.
[03:52:36.533 --> 03:52:44.396]  What was the Obama administration's policy in regards to this policy or how children are treated?
[03:52:44.396 --> 03:52:46.657]  Were they in cages under the Obama administration as well?
[03:52:48.005 --> 03:52:50.906]  Well, if we're going to use that terminology, yes, they were.
[03:52:50.906 --> 03:52:59.169]  The exact same facilities that Trump is using are the exact same facilities that Barack Obama used.
[03:52:59.169 --> 03:53:05.032]  So my issue is that I'm glad people are horrified about the realities along our border.
[03:53:05.032 --> 03:53:06.212]  I think that's wonderful.
[03:53:06.212 --> 03:53:08.353]  I don't want to discourage that in any way.
[03:53:08.353 --> 03:53:13.375]  My problem is that when I see them blaming it on Trump, when really it's not on Trump,
[03:53:14.595 --> 03:53:20.763]  Like, that's just the same facilities and they were silent even though the information was available.
[03:53:20.763 --> 03:53:22.545]  And they were silent during the Obama years.
[03:53:22.545 --> 03:53:28.273]  It makes me feel like they're doing it with a political motive rather than an altruistic or a humanitarian motive.
[03:53:28.273 --> 03:53:30.756]  And that's where my objection comes in.
[03:53:30.756 --> 03:53:32.918]  But I remind people that the difference right now
[03:53:33.619 --> 03:53:39.025]  Is that what Barack Obama did after 2009, he started to change it.
[03:53:39.025 --> 03:53:41.547]  He started to not really enforce certain laws.
[03:53:41.547 --> 03:53:45.931]  And he basically said, look, if you're a kid or you come with an adult, we're not going to keep you in custody.
[03:53:45.931 --> 03:53:51.837]  And then he formalized that in 2014 with what's called the November 20th Jay Johnson memo.
[03:53:51.837 --> 03:53:55.881]  And so basically what he did, he goes, I don't care what laws Congress passed.
[03:53:56.633 --> 03:53:57.754]  This is what I'm going to do.
[03:53:57.754 --> 03:53:59.975]  I'm just not going to prosecute those laws.
[03:53:59.975 --> 03:54:05.797]  And what Trump is saying is, no, we're a nation of laws and we're going to prosecute the laws.
[03:54:05.797 --> 03:54:08.058]  If you violate the laws, you're going to get prosecuted.
[03:54:08.058 --> 03:54:10.480]  This is what happens if you get prosecuted.
[03:54:12.145 --> 03:54:13.005]  Here's the deal.
[03:54:13.005 --> 03:54:16.727]  If you don't like the laws, Congress needs to change the laws.
[03:54:16.727 --> 03:54:24.129]  But don't just leave the laws alone to protect yourself politically and expect me to ignore the laws whenever we're a nation of laws.
[03:54:24.129 --> 03:54:27.991]  Because that is what makes us different from Mexico, is we are a nation of laws.
[03:54:27.991 --> 03:54:29.111]  Yes, we have corruption.
[03:54:29.111 --> 03:54:30.892]  Yes, we have a lot of problems.
[03:54:30.892 --> 03:54:34.153]  But not in comparison and context.
[03:54:34.153 --> 03:54:36.074]  We really don't, compared to Mexico.
[03:54:36.654 --> 03:54:39.796]  And us being a nation of laws is why our economy thrives.
[03:54:39.796 --> 03:54:42.157]  It's why a lot of it is part of that.
[03:54:42.157 --> 03:54:44.099]  And so we need to retain that.
[03:54:44.099 --> 03:54:48.121]  And you can't just say, okay, you people never mind about the law.
[03:54:48.121 --> 03:54:49.702]  You have to change the law.
[03:54:49.702 --> 03:54:51.823]  And that's what he's saying, and that's what he's doing.
[03:54:51.823 --> 03:54:53.804]  And so is he separating children?
[03:54:53.804 --> 03:54:55.926]  Is it happening more than under Obama?
[03:54:55.926 --> 03:54:58.987]  Yes, it is, because he's following the law more than Obama did.
[03:54:58.987 --> 03:55:01.869]  Obama literally just said, hey, I'm not going to follow that law.
[03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:07.875]  To be fair, the Republicans could change the laws now.
[03:55:07.875 --> 03:55:08.896]  They have enough control.
[03:55:08.896 --> 03:55:12.981]  Even though they don't have a supermajority in the Senate, they could do it.
[03:55:12.981 --> 03:55:15.885]  They have had the supermajority and chose not to do it.
[03:55:15.885 --> 03:55:18.868]  And then in 2009 and 2010, the Democrats had a supermajority.
[03:55:18.868 --> 03:55:19.850]  If they had enough power,
[03:55:20.430 --> 03:55:20.850]  Yeah.
[03:55:20.850 --> 03:55:23.132]  They ran Obamacare down our throats.
[03:55:23.132 --> 03:55:26.593]  They had enough power to change the immigration laws, but yet they didn't.
[03:55:26.593 --> 03:55:29.435]  Why didn't they change the immigration laws?
[03:55:29.435 --> 03:55:29.815]  They didn't.
[03:55:29.815 --> 03:55:31.776]  Brandon, your heart is in the right place.
[03:55:31.776 --> 03:55:34.417]  Your facts are in the right place.
[03:55:34.417 --> 03:55:37.519]  You know, I think that what you're doing is powerful.
[03:55:37.519 --> 03:55:44.903]  People can obviously find you at Breitbart.com slash Texas, but where else can they find you as we get off with you?
[03:55:46.278 --> 03:55:52.920]  I think the best way to find me is probably at Brandon Darby on Twitter.
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:53.720]  See what I have to say?
[03:55:53.720 --> 03:55:56.541]  I try to be as informative as possible.
[03:55:56.541 --> 03:56:00.702]  I try to be fair.
[03:56:00.702 --> 03:56:05.723]  I try to be very considerate and compassionate about what's occurring on the border to the migrants.
[03:56:05.723 --> 03:56:09.744]  I tend to blame Congress more than I blame the people who come here.
[03:56:09.744 --> 03:56:10.444]  I don't blame them.
[03:56:10.444 --> 03:56:12.265]  I would, too, under the circumstances.
[03:56:13.065 --> 03:56:26.391]  And so, you know, come on Twitter and let's interact and enjoy the information that my team puts together because we have a unique project, as you know, like Cartel Chronicles.
[03:56:26.391 --> 03:56:27.672]  It's Mexican journalists.
[03:56:28.212 --> 03:56:31.234]  And citizen journalists, we publish it in English and Spanish.
[03:56:31.234 --> 03:56:35.536]  We do it under a pseudonym so they don't get killed because they would get killed.
[03:56:35.536 --> 03:56:35.836]  Right.
[03:56:35.836 --> 03:56:40.338]  And they write about what these cartels are doing, who they are, who their business ties are.
[03:56:40.338 --> 03:56:47.322]  We're constantly exposing them and there's just not a dang thing that the cartels can do about it because they don't know who it is doing it.
[03:56:47.322 --> 03:56:48.642]  And it's a beautiful project.
[03:56:48.642 --> 03:56:53.625]  It's one of the most, I think it's one of the most giving and loving projects for people in Northern Mexico.
[03:56:54.165 --> 03:56:54.606]  Thank you, Ali.
[03:57:08.297 --> 03:57:09.257]  Yeah, of course.
[03:57:09.257 --> 03:57:11.918]  Y'all, this has been an exciting past hour.
[03:57:11.918 --> 03:57:14.298]  We talked about how to save the West.
[03:57:14.298 --> 03:57:17.559]  With Steve Franson, we talked about how to do that internally.
[03:57:17.559 --> 03:57:20.680]  With Brandon Darby, we talked about how to do that externally.
[03:57:20.680 --> 03:57:27.902]  I am forever grateful to InfoWars for letting us talk to millions of people across lots of different platforms.
[03:57:27.902 --> 03:57:30.082]  It's very exciting to give this information.
[03:57:30.082 --> 03:57:33.423]  And there's no one whispering in my ear, Ali, you can't say this, you can't say this.
[03:57:33.423 --> 03:57:34.744]  Here's our agenda.
[03:57:34.744 --> 03:57:36.344]  And that's why it's important that we support
[03:57:36.904 --> 03:57:37.945]  And we purchased.
[03:57:37.945 --> 03:57:39.186]  The Breitbart has a store.
[03:57:39.186 --> 03:57:40.388]  InfoWars has a store.
[03:57:40.388 --> 03:57:44.031]  Thank you guys so much.
[03:57:44.031 --> 03:57:47.074]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia.
[03:57:47.074 --> 03:57:48.615]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:57:48.615 --> 03:57:49.156]  Thanks for calling.
[03:57:49.156 --> 03:57:50.257]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:57:50.257 --> 03:57:54.221]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:57:54.221 --> 03:57:58.965]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[03:57:58.985 --> 03:57:59.666]  Thank you very much.
[03:58:19.765 --> 03:58:28.354]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:58:28.354 --> 03:58:33.240]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:58:33.240 --> 03:58:38.845]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:58:44.525 --> 03:58:48.528]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:58:48.528 --> 03:58:51.270]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:58:51.270 --> 03:58:56.073]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
