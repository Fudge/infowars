[00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.047]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:17.888]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:19.689]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:20.809]  Thursday, 27th day of December 2018.
[00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.411]  The final fumes of 2018 are now disappearing out the tailpipe into oblivion, into the rearview mirror.
[00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:55.498]  You know, I've always tried, in 24 years on air, it'll be 24 years on air in April, I've always tried, in almost 24 years on air, to just read some of the headlines before I start the broadcast, just to give people an idea of the insanity.
[00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:02.243]  And how these patterns show up, even though there's not an intent to do that, in the type of news that's out there.
[00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:03.144]  It's crazy.
[00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:19.165]  But it's like that old 1960s or 70s Tootsie Pop lollipop ad where the little kid asked the wise old owl, they said, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll?
[00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:20.146]  Tootsie Pop.
[00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:21.726]  And he says, let's see.
[00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:23.667]  One, two, three.
[00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:24.788]  A three.
[00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:27.489]  Because you can't ever really lick it and lick it.
[00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.551]  I tried when I was a kid without just going ahead and biting into the chocolate.
[00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.307]  Well, some of this is not delicious chocolate.
[00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:36.288]  Some of it is really, really bad stuff.
[00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:40.170]  But, uh, you know, let's just, if we have audio, can we hear from Mr. Rowell here in a moment?
[00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.451]  Maybe we should just talk about happy things.
[00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:45.952]  You know, I went for a hike this morning with the mist.
[00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:51.175]  We got probably five inches of rain last night, so it was all this mist hanging on the forest.
[00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:56.978]  And I saw the moon rise out of the mist, and it was just spectacularly beautiful.
[00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.306]  Then I saw some deer running through the woods.
[00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.687]  I walked by a babbling brook.
[00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:18.833]  And it was just so beautiful, and I thought, how do we fight the globalists, what they're trying to do to our children, what they're trying to do to our culture, how they're trying to dominate us psychologically and spiritually and financially, at the same time not have them run our lives and fill our minds with their depressing garbage?
[00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:20.674]  It really is a Catch-22.
[00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:26.056]  And so, in the new year, and I hope the crew reminds me of this,
[00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:48.187]  I really want to try to mix in some of the wonders, some of the magic, some of the cool things, some of the positive things in the world that we're fighting for versus just laundry listing all the horrible things that the vampire forces, and we call them goblins, that's what they call themselves, but the vampire
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.240]  Vampires, from every angle, every direction, every fiber of their... fetid...
[00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.612]  So we're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:02.993]  Now, I wasn't going to be coming in today.
[00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:13.799]  I was going to be at the office working, but I was going to have a work-cation here, getting lots of behind-the-scenes things done and tweaked and things like that for some of the things we're planning to launch.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700]  New broadcast, things like that.
[00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.263]  New websites, a lot of other features, updates.
[00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:24.245]  But then Owen Schroer's plane got canceled last night.
[00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:29.241]  So he's flying in right now, so he won't be here, but we had a guest host for two hours.
[00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:39.288]  Mike Adams is always intriguing and informative, so he'll just be hosting by himself in the second and third hour today on just a gigantor issue.
[00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:49.756]  In fact, before I drove in this morning, I was thinking, when I got word that Owen's plane didn't make it in, I was thinking, maybe I should do the whole first hour
[00:03:50.891 --> 00:04:10.428]  On what Mike Adams is going to be covering, because you can either only focus on one story for the whole show to properly cover the facets, or you can just mention it and say, oh, by the way, they're in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and everywhere else saying, you know, fertility is dropping to almost zero in the first world.
[00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:13.223]  And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:16.248]  We don't know why it's happening, but soon the scourge of humans will be removed.
[00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:17.970]  And boy, wouldn't it be great if there were no humans.
[00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:25.921]  Now that's the complete mainlining of everything that I began to warn people of in earnest 24 years ago.
[00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:40.851]  I mean, it was in the literature, and people wrote books about it, and the John Birch Society talked about it, but it would be kind of like, oh yeah, and the globalists say they want to bring in a world government, have a one-child policy, and put chemicals in the water to reduce your fertility, and they would have quotes.
[00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.512]  It was kind of an afterthought.
[00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:45.513]  Oh, and by the way, when they get their world government, they're going to do this.
[00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:48.095]  Just kind of like, oh, by the way, they're worse than him.
[00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.819]  And they do it by stealth.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.681]  But see, now it's the big rollout!
[00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.983]  Hey, we did sterilize your ass!
[00:04:55.843 --> 00:04:57.144]  And give you cancer!
[00:04:57.404 --> 00:04:58.185]  How's that sound?
[00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:08.251]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:17.737]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:27.015]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:35.057]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:38.178]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:39.759]  It really is amazing.
[00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:46.561]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.682]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:51.643]  Of InfoWars.
[00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:53.524]  So please spread the links.
[00:05:53.784 --> 00:05:56.806]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[00:05:57.087 --> 00:05:59.789]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.470]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.791]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:22.108]  After crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.593]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:48.062]  It's Thursday, the 27th day of December 2018, and this broadcast is going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:54.228]  And the Mike Adams, the health ranger, is going to be co-hosting in the second and third hour today.
[00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:56.368]  Here's some of the big headlines.
[00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:57.588]  We talked about it some yesterday.
[00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:04.733]  Globalists call for, quote, celebration of plunging human fertility as war against humanity accelerates.
[00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:07.735]  That's an article by Mike Adams.
[00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:09.056]  Here's a PJW article.
[00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:09.917]  Expert!
[00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:12.879]  Collapsing fertility rates in the West should be celebrated.
[00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:18.382]  Yeah, it's really good to have no birth rate in the highest IQ areas.
[00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:21.825]  That is a really fantastic idea.
[00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:24.696]  So it's all being done by design.
[00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:25.756]  So that's coming up.
[00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:39.143]  Let me just, because I think it's just best to read these headlines, go over some of these articles here because they're extremely, extremely illustrative.
[00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:44.726]  Amazon and others have officially started their drone deliveries to people's houses of goods.
[00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:48.933]  And it says it's scaring dogs and annoying neighbors, but that's okay.
[00:07:49.233 --> 00:08:00.096]  There's another type of drone delivery that you really don't want, and that's Russia is setting up a nuclear bomber base on idyllic Caribbean island, just like the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.
[00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:06.132]  And that's because we've been moving nuclear weapons up to their borders.
[00:08:06.232 --> 00:08:13.000]  So, Russia has sent supersonic bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles to one of Venezuela's islands in the Caribbean Sea, according to reports.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:22.050]  This follows news earlier in the month that the former Soviet state was planning to set up its first military base in the Caribbean after striking a deal with cash-strapped Venezuela.
[00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:25.685]  Isn't that just horrible?
[00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:28.746]  That's the kind of articles we have just stacked up here.
[00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:29.306]  Oh!
[00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:32.827]  That's like saying Hitler had a blind spot to anti-Semitism.
[00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:36.228]  Or that a wolf had a blind spot to eating deer.
[00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:40.250]  Or fish have a blind spot to swimming in the ocean.
[00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.390]  Or
[00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:55.825]  Bulls are blind to the color red?
[00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:56.405]  They're not.
[00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:58.066]  It really stands out to them.
[00:08:59.027 --> 00:09:03.370]  His deputy pope ran the child kidnapping and murder rings.
[00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.971]  They're digging up dead kids everywhere.
[00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:06.112]  Murder rings.
[00:09:06.132 --> 00:09:10.515]  They don't just have, you know, ten devil worshippers in the church.
[00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:13.396]  That's the best place for a devil worshipper to rape a kid is in the church.
[00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:15.178]  That's come out in Pennsylvania, everywhere.
[00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:19.661]  There's the next level where they strangle them.
[00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:27.884]  Or where they cut them up and drink their blood in a Black Sabbath.
[00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:31.231]  Yes, that's what a Black Sabbath is.
[00:09:32.312 --> 00:09:36.736]  You lance the child, begin drinking its blood, terrorizing it, and getting the endorphins.
[00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:38.417]  Then you kill him.
[00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.380]  Generally after you rape the hell out of him.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:47.705]  But, continuing, Pope Francis' early blind spot on sex abuse threatens the legacy.
[00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:52.509]  He came in as the Jesuit Pope, using blackmail and pedophile rings.
[00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:54.791]  That was even the one in Guardian that he used blackmail.
[00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:58.368]  No, he's not blind.
[00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:04.550]  He can see for miles and miles and miles and miles like the eye of Sauron.
[00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.590]  Breathe in flame.
[00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:10.431]  You know of what I speak.
[00:10:15.972 --> 00:10:19.213]  Coming up, I'm gonna get more into this because it's such a big deal.
[00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:27.060]  You have about a thousand people a day for the last five years that's admitted dying in Venezuela of starvation.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.983]  But they have a law they passed where you can't say that because it's embarrassing.
[00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:36.306]  And Guatemala has a lot of folks starving a day.
[00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.808]  It's been a hellish nightmare forever.
[00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:41.090]  I had family that lived down there.
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.071]  Tried to stabilize it, you couldn't do it.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:55.483]  That family told me, before they died, that international governments were involved in Guatemala trafficking children.
[00:10:57.383 --> 00:10:59.304]  And what does the UN do with George Soros?
[00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:09.047]  They bring the children up to our borders, and then they pass through customs without any check for diseases or names, and they're given to adults, not their parents.
[00:11:10.028 --> 00:11:10.528]  Or family.
[00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:11.208]  Familia.
[00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:14.629]  And they disappear into the child sex network.
[00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:16.350]  That's even the Senate report.
[00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:19.363]  Oh, but that's kept very quiet.
[00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:25.548]  We have a second Guatemalan child dying.
[00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:28.630]  They get across the border.
[00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.711]  They've been on a 2,000-mile trek from Guatemala.
[00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:32.232]  They're emaciated.
[00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:33.914]  They've got all sorts of diseases.
[00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:37.796]  And then they die, usually about a day after they get in custody.
[00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:39.698]  They make it to the finish line.
[00:11:40.338 --> 00:11:43.841]  Dad dragging them, Mom dragging them, or somebody else dragging them, somebody who says that they're dead.
[00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:47.123]  And they die, and then it's America's fault.
[00:11:50.034 --> 00:11:54.017]  Meanwhile, I have an entire stack of news that I didn't even look for.
[00:11:54.037 --> 00:11:55.458]  I didn't even tell them to search this.
[00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:56.358]  This is just in the news.
[00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:07.786]  That means if I go look, I'll find a hundred times that of tuberculosis and cholera and bubonic plague never seen here in decades.
[00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:09.507]  Oh, oh, and leprosy.
[00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:11.709]  Communicable wet leprosy.
[00:12:12.757 --> 00:12:16.380]  Eight-year-old migrant child from Guatemala dies in U.S.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.564]  custody, the second one, and it's all over the news calling Trump a murderer.
[00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:29.871]  But don't worry, the DHS has been called to investigate growing numbers of sick migrants over the border and why they're so sick.
[00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:36.697]  The CDC's been called in about the huge health epidemics all over Latin America because Latin America's collapsing.
[00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:44.699]  And the impact of homelessness and the opioid crisis having on San Francisco streets, the feces, the needles.
[00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:51.086]  San Diego sees surge in salmonella cases, San Diego Tribune, but they don't know why.
[00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:58.155]  Oh, I don't know, you just imported to California 10 million illegal aliens the last decade or so?
[00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:02.389]  Oh yeah, the number of illegals in the country is like 45 million, 50 million probably.
[00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:05.311]  It was 30 million 10 years ago.
[00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:06.952]  And here's the thing.
[00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:14.618]  I walked into a clean gas station this morning.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:28.009]  And I was pumping gas and I said, I'm gonna go take a piss, excuse my French, and I go in the bathroom, it's a clean bathroom, and there's a pile of toilet paper wadded up with human feces all over it.
[00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:28.910]  A huge big pile.
[00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:34.140]  And I go, I bet that toilet flush is really good.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.083]  Because that's just the pile in the last hour or two since they cleaned it.
[00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:40.666]  It's just a clean restroom, other than a pile of... I'm gonna tell you the rest of the story in a moment.
[00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:41.607]  Sorry this is gross.
[00:13:41.927 --> 00:13:43.668]  I go over, take care of my business, wash my hands.
[00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.531]  After I'd flush, went straight down.
[00:13:49.193 --> 00:13:54.717]  And I just looked over at that pile... of ass wipes.
[00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:58.781]  You know, they gotta put signs up at a lot of the truck stops for the illegal aliens.
[00:14:00.287 --> 00:14:02.028]  And it says, flush your paper.
[00:14:02.048 --> 00:14:05.750]  Because see, in Mexico, and other third world areas, you don't flush it.
[00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:07.211]  Because it can't take it.
[00:14:08.612 --> 00:14:10.373]  It's water only, into like an aqueduct.
[00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:12.674]  Or right out in the river.
[00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:17.397]  So, we videotaped this before, although they deleted our YouTube channel, so it's hard to find.
[00:14:18.138 --> 00:14:23.881]  Where I showed it, at truck stops all over Texas, and all over, it says, put your toilet paper, but you know what?
[00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:25.062]  It's people's custom.
[00:14:25.502 --> 00:14:26.583]  They're not gonna stop.
[00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:33.253]  It's fun to just wipe your ass and lay in big piles of ass wipes.
[00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:35.054]  And I'm sorry to talk about this on a family show.
[00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:36.374]  Your kids have got to see it!
[00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:41.877]  And so you wonder why there's a collapse of hygiene.
[00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:43.938]  It's called civilization, see?
[00:14:44.338 --> 00:14:45.859]  You import Venezuela.
[00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:48.160]  You import the poorest people out of Mexico.
[00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:55.064]  You import the lowest IQ, dumbest, poorest people in the world who've been promised freebies here.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:04.767]  And you're going to import the crime, and the kidnapping, and the drugs, and the ass wiping, and everything else that you get.
[00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:08.630]  So, I have a new nickname for illegal aliens that do this.
[00:15:08.651 --> 00:15:10.152]  They are literally ass wipers.
[00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:12.674]  I mean, at least they're wiping their ass.
[00:15:12.734 --> 00:15:16.317]  I mean, I'll give them to you as the Muslims do it with their damn left hand.
[00:15:17.258 --> 00:15:18.800]  And then wash it off in the frickin' sink.
[00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.831]  And that's come out in Amazon lawsuits and other things that Amazon won't tell its Islamic employees to stop.
[00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.891]  They'll also hang their ass over the sink and do it right there.
[00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.292]  Hey, you want to hear a little bit more about this?
[00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:31.492]  I'm sorry, I have to look at it.
[00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:38.473]  By the way, they don't even put the damn paper that they've wiped their butts with in the trash can.
[00:15:38.653 --> 00:15:41.314]  Because there aren't trash cans in Latin America, baby.
[00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.134]  You put it in the corner.
[00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:45.815]  And then a contendant comes in and sweeps shit up.
[00:15:46.475 --> 00:15:48.435]  They don't want our civilization.
[00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:52.315]  That's why they didn't build civilization.
[00:15:53.015 --> 00:16:00.640]  But don't worry, by the time the globalists are done, America and all our wealth and power will be used to wipe the ass of the New World Order.
[00:16:01.081 --> 00:16:02.442]  I'm having no part of that.
[00:16:04.523 --> 00:16:05.964]  We're ending the year.
[00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:07.725]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:08.766]  It's been an insane year.
[00:16:10.047 --> 00:16:17.592]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming, and the lawsuits, the demonization, and the attacks, and everything else, because of one thing.
[00:16:18.692 --> 00:16:29.641]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers, understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:34.745]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down.
[00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.832]  If we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[00:16:38.852 --> 00:16:44.274]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.995]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:49.295]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:52.857]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[00:16:52.877 --> 00:16:55.257]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.718]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:03.200]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:16.666]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:27.393]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[00:17:28.473 --> 00:17:34.497]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it, that they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at,
[00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:42.595]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:48.640]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.483]  That's a separate battle.
[00:17:52.783 --> 00:18:00.108]  And so, they would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:03.351]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[00:18:04.264 --> 00:18:09.627]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flack, comes from that.
[00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:25.295]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flack is, and we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most, and lo and behold,
[00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:30.354]  That turns out to be the most accurate information.
[00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:34.280]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:44.210]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:45.992]  We've got whatever the best is.
[00:18:46.032 --> 00:18:57.619]  I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.560]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:06.747]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out.
[00:19:07.569 --> 00:19:08.830]  Until January 1st.
[00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.171]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support.
[00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:14.733]  Selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:18.715]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[00:19:19.475 --> 00:19:20.596]  Free shipping store-wide.
[00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:22.537]  50 to 75% off everything.
[00:19:23.377 --> 00:19:25.138]  Double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:19:25.558 --> 00:19:26.819]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:30.501]  That is extended, but only a few days left until...
[00:19:31.784 --> 00:19:32.564]  The end of this year.
[00:19:33.444 --> 00:19:45.267]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:51.089]  And in fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item, like colloidal silver, or something like that.
[00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:56.790]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.650]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:00.451]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:06.523 --> 00:20:20.708]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:27.510]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.811]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:20:32.008 --> 00:20:50.244]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:56.950]  This hemp seed, be careful how you use it.
[00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.013]  For to grow hemp legally, you must have a federal registration and tax stamp.
[00:21:02.973 --> 00:21:05.635]  This is provided for in your contract.
[00:21:05.715 --> 00:21:09.137]  Ask your AAA committeeman or your county agent about it.
[00:21:09.637 --> 00:21:13.500]  President Trump recently signed the Agriculture Improvement Act.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.542]  This act designates hemp as a bona fide agricultural crop.
[00:21:17.962 --> 00:21:22.285]  Through fires, floods, and freezing weather, we will always stand with the American farmers.
[00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:26.228]  The Farm Bill doubles the amount of farmers that they can borrow.
[00:21:27.108 --> 00:21:29.390]  To expand and improve their farms.
[00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.892]  It expands and goes all over rural broadband.
[00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:35.313]  We are doing broadband.
[00:21:35.714 --> 00:21:37.275]  Everyone wanted it so badly.
[00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:41.958]  It's amazing how sophisticated the whole farm industry has become.
[00:21:42.698 --> 00:21:50.264]  But it expands rural broadband and dedicates additional resources to fight the opioid crisis.
[00:21:50.464 --> 00:21:51.465]  Let me ask you this, sir.
[00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:56.729]  This legislation is also removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, legalizing hemp production.
[00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:59.932]  This provision was championed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
[00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.214]  What impact is this having on your constituents?
[00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:07.507]  Well, again, obviously, if it's a profitable crop for agriculture, then they will participate.
[00:22:07.887 --> 00:22:10.909]  They indicate there are many multiple industrial uses for hemp.
[00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:17.434]  This is an industrial use product medicinally, as well as other products, and we look forward to developing markets for it.
[00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:21.296]  If it's a profitable crop, agriculture needs new products.
[00:22:21.336 --> 00:22:27.080]  We're so productive in soybeans and corn, we're looking for markets worldwide now to sell those.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.784]  But if this is a product that can be utilized throughout the economy, it'd be good for agriculture and good for the economy.
[00:22:32.964 --> 00:22:41.747]  The Act introduced the rocky legal path towards complete CBD oil production, made rocky by the pharmaceutical industry's stranglehold.
[00:22:42.007 --> 00:22:44.848]  Now is there more demand for hemp than what you can grow?
[00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:46.409]  Oh my god, yes.
[00:22:46.429 --> 00:22:46.409]  100%.
[00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:53.051]  Danny Billings started growing hemp in Colorado last year after voters made it legal, along with recreational marijuana.
[00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:56.534]  The hemp plant is cannabis without the psychoactive properties.
[00:22:56.674 --> 00:23:05.903]  Here they're using new technology to quickly turn hemp stalks into raw materials like this pulp to make paper or this sugar to make biofuels.
[00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:08.526]  A sustainable alternative to oil.
[00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:09.907]  So you process the entire plant?
[00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:10.628]  The entire plant.
[00:23:10.808 --> 00:23:18.615]  Some of our clients specifically are trying to get away from oil-based products that they sell globally to bio-based products.
[00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:28.165]  Furthermore, hemp could actually benefit the environment on a massive scale, perhaps even negating the ongoing climate change debate once and for all.
[00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:35.752]  Hemp paper is recycled seven to eight times on average, while wood paper can only be recycled three times.
[00:23:36.132 --> 00:23:45.599]  Back in 1916, the USDA reported that an acre of hemp produced as much paper as four acres of trees annually.
[00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:49.802]  Seventy percent of those forests have been decimated since 1916.
[00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:53.768]  In the 1930s, they made tinctures.
[00:23:53.788 --> 00:23:56.290]  What were they making the tinctures for, and why were they doing these tinctures?
[00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.152]  Well, I mean, the medicinal uses of hemp are just numerous.
[00:23:59.192 --> 00:24:03.854]  The hemp helps, well, we can talk about the cancer effects of hemp, but it helps with inflammation.
[00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:05.155]  It's very anti-inflammatory.
[00:24:05.175 --> 00:24:06.116]  It helps with seizures.
[00:24:06.276 --> 00:24:11.379]  It's very effective with PTSD, for the vets that are coming back that have post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:24:11.419 --> 00:24:16.302]  There's about a dozen different cancers that have been studied in depth with medicinal marijuana, with hemp.
[00:24:16.582 --> 00:24:25.044]  And so the studies from brain cancer to prostate cancer to pancreatic cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, it's amazing.
[00:24:25.224 --> 00:24:32.506]  Hemp could right the ship in order to save America, but only if the minions of globalization get out of its way.
[00:24:33.027 --> 00:24:33.967]  It's Trump shutdown.
[00:24:34.927 --> 00:24:43.352]  This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall, and it'll hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shutdown.
[00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:45.573]  He admitted he wanted a shutdown.
[00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:48.495]  It's hard to believe that he would want that.
[00:24:49.315 --> 00:25:04.424]  While the Democrats were all snug in their beds, paid for by the taxpayers of America, President Trump decided not to celebrate Christmas in Florida and remained in the White House, fighting for the security of his fellow countrymen and women.
[00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:08.168]  I'm fighting very hard for border security, so important.
[00:25:08.728 --> 00:25:10.589]  I've already started building the wall.
[00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:15.531]  We've built large sections and we're fixing up a lot of other sections that are a mess.
[00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:18.392]  But the fact is, we need the wall.
[00:25:18.732 --> 00:25:19.953]  The Democrats know it.
[00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:21.394]  Everybody knows it.
[00:25:21.814 --> 00:25:24.375]  It's only a game when they say you don't need the wall.
[00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:28.297]  You can look at their eyes and you can say, well, they're not telling the truth.
[00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:34.359]  They want to try and do anything possible to hurt us because of the fact it's politics.
[00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:35.699]  I understand that.
[00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:40.801]  I don't even hold it against them, except you should always put your country first.
[00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:42.201]  And they're not doing that.
[00:25:42.421 --> 00:25:43.802]  They're putting politics first.
[00:25:44.042 --> 00:26:08.825]  And as the Dow surged 1,000 points, the biggest single gain in history, despite Fed stooge Jerome Powell's tweaking of interest rates four times, while two more are to be expected in 2019, much to the dismay of economists like UC Berkeley economist Brad DeLong, as reported by the LA Times, as DeLong argued that there's no evidence that interest rates, although low, have been unsustainably low.
[00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:15.447]  And no plausible model for how raising rates now, so they can be cut in the future, makes economic sense.
[00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:26.492]  The argument, he says, resembles the argument that you should let the others run a lap before you start running at all, because then you will be fresher and so can run faster and so win the race.
[00:26:26.812 --> 00:26:35.015]  Even though the Fed had spooked the markets and the Democrats ignored the Christmas wishes of the American people, the spirit of Christmas stayed strong.
[00:26:35.275 --> 00:26:37.596]  As President Trump and First Lady Melania
[00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:40.839]  At ease, at ease.
[00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:44.923]  Let's have a good time.
[00:26:45.764 --> 00:26:46.845]  Let's have a good time.
[00:26:48.166 --> 00:26:53.611]  And we had an incredible meeting that lasted for about an hour and
[00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:56.662]  You have no idea what we've come up with.
[00:26:56.722 --> 00:26:57.723]  You're going to be so happy.
[00:26:58.464 --> 00:26:59.545]  You're going to be so happy.
[00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:03.390]  I want to just first say thank you for everything.
[00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:08.497]  And on behalf of Melania and myself, we had a great flight in.
[00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:10.359]  So I want to thank you, honey.
[00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:11.240]  Come say hello, honey.
[00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:12.281]  Say hello.
[00:27:17.617 --> 00:27:20.219]  I'm very honored to be here tonight.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:26.065]  I thank you for your service, for your sacrifice, and keeping us safe and free.
[00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:36.394]  I'm very proud of you, and on behalf of our nation, I'm wishing you a Merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year.
[00:27:36.894 --> 00:27:39.677]  Thank you again, and to your families.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.881]  Let's let her make the speech, right?
[00:27:53.982 --> 00:27:54.663]  Yeah, she's great.
[00:27:54.703 --> 00:27:57.025]  Very popular first lady and a great person.
[00:27:57.826 --> 00:28:03.951]  And I want to thank General La Camera for the incredible job he's done.
[00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:09.336]  And I was just saying we had a meeting with him and some of your great representatives.
[00:28:09.456 --> 00:28:15.241]  And we have some ideas that are more than ideas that are going to be just... We like to win.
[00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:16.062]  Do we like to win?
[00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:17.123]  We're going to win.
[00:28:18.004 --> 00:28:39.972]  So Melania and I are thrilled to be here with the extraordinary men and women of the American Armed Forces, the greatest military, and especially as we get all of this billions and billions of dollars of new equipment that I approved over the last two years, you're getting such new equipment, your eyes are popping, right?
[00:28:40.913 --> 00:28:41.453]  Your eyes are popping.
[00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:45.365]  You're getting the best equipment in the world.
[00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:50.208]  As you know, it was being very rapidly depleted and it wasn't good.
[00:28:50.248 --> 00:28:54.791]  We weren't going to let that happen to you or to our country.
[00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:58.613]  2019 is already shaping up to be a key year for independence.
[00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:00.174]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:05.637]  Since the time of Plato, 2300 plus years ago,
[00:29:09.617 --> 00:29:12.260]  Elites believe that the Earth was overpopulated.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:21.628]  Now, you could argue that today, but in the time of Plato, there wasn't more than a hundred thousand people on the Greek islands.
[00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:28.274]  But in his Republic, he wrote about humans crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:30.796]  And it was his ideas
[00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:36.428]  2,000 years later that were picked up by Malthus.
[00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:38.089]  Sir Malthus.
[00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:49.942]  Malthus wanted to herd people in Ireland and in England to pour people into tiny, small, 200-foot apartments so that they would fester with disease and die.
[00:29:49.962 --> 00:29:52.564]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[00:29:53.365 --> 00:30:00.288]  That means you just believe in making things worse, so that you get rid of the poor people, you get rid of the dumb people, you get rid of the stupid people.
[00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:14.935]  He predicted that within a hundred years, that was the 1700s, he predicted by the 1800s, the Earth would reach its carrying potential, and there would be a planetary collapse of the entire human population.
[00:30:15.636 --> 00:30:21.279]  So when you hear about eugenics, and you read about the UN saying we're overpopulated, and you see them pushing for
[00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:23.599]  Global one-child policies.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:35.762]  Remember that this has been a long-term view of aristocrats, of royalty, of oligarchs, of plutocrats for 2,000 plus years.
[00:30:36.862 --> 00:30:42.324]  And really what they use this for is a way to dehumanize the general public.
[00:30:43.004 --> 00:30:43.744]  Why educate?
[00:30:43.824 --> 00:30:44.824]  Why have sewage?
[00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:48.325]  Why have sanitation if these people are animals to begin with?
[00:30:49.505 --> 00:30:56.091]  But see, once sanitation and things were adopted 150 years ago, infectious diseases went down over 95%.
[00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:59.093]  So then the eugenicists met and they said, what are we going to do?
[00:31:00.094 --> 00:31:03.236]  People aren't dying from infectious diseases and malthusian plants failing.
[00:31:03.256 --> 00:31:08.560]  They said, we'll take all these good scientists and people that have developed all these vaccines and things that are good.
[00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:14.207]  And we'll take control of these with modern medical science through the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:31:14.888 --> 00:31:17.611]  And we'll actually control it and make everything worse.
[00:31:18.352 --> 00:31:20.234]  Cancer was incredibly rare 100 years ago.
[00:31:20.855 --> 00:31:24.680]  By the 20s, the Rockefellers had discovered most of it was viral and weaponized it.
[00:31:25.461 --> 00:31:27.003]  And there's hundreds of other examples.
[00:31:28.689 --> 00:31:38.274]  So when you pull back from this and understand that it's not that environmentalism is bad, it's good, but the bad guys run it, not to help the earth or people, but to control it.
[00:31:38.714 --> 00:31:44.857]  When you realize that vaccine technology is good and real, but that bad guys have it and are adding Trojan horses, then you understand.
[00:31:45.618 --> 00:31:51.741]  Just like computers are good, but then they can be used for bad with Trojan horses to control.
[00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:55.863]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:31:57.173 --> 00:31:58.796]  That's why you have an attack on the family.
[00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:00.558]  That's why you have an attack on the middle class.
[00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:04.765]  That's why globalists want to make populations poor and stupid and controllable.
[00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:08.050]  Because only one level of the eugenics operation
[00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:11.487]  It says they're actually just going to get rid of the poor people.
[00:32:12.247 --> 00:32:12.888]  That's bad enough.
[00:32:13.448 --> 00:32:21.355]  The truth is they're just using it as an excuse to humanize all life, throw chivalry out the window, and treat their fellow humans like they're animals.
[00:32:22.215 --> 00:32:29.361]  Because the globalists are sociopathic and psychotic in their spectrum, and they project their own hatred on the public.
[00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:50.295]  And their own loathing of themselves on the public, and then cover it, claiming that they're nothing but social Darwinists, carrying out a cleansing of the Earth, when they're the ones with the open-air genetic engineering, they're the ones with the gene splicing, they're the ones with the human-animal chimeras, they're the ones with the atmospheric manipulations, when they're the ones endangering the entire planet.
[00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:52.837]  So as we go into the new year, understand this.
[00:32:52.857 --> 00:32:53.658]  A 2,300-year plan
[00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:58.160]  He's fighting against a plan for a pro-human future.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.901]  Choose renaissance, not death.
[00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:01.242]  Choose InfoWars.
[00:33:06.144 --> 00:33:12.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:24.533]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:45.079]  I'm going to try to put in as much as I can in this segment.
[00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:46.479]  It's so critical.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.460]  But basically, our life force is being turned off.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.161]  Our will to survive is being turned off.
[00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:57.042]  We're being taught it's cool to die, it's cool to be destroyed, it's cool to be overrun.
[00:33:57.442 --> 00:34:00.263]  This is a program of global domination, psychological warfare.
[00:34:00.283 --> 00:34:02.483]  And Mike Adams is going to be breaking it down in the next hour.
[00:34:02.503 --> 00:34:03.924]  A globalist call for celebration.
[00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:05.104]  This is the New York Times.
[00:34:05.624 --> 00:34:09.085]  A plunging human fertility as war against humanity accelerates.
[00:34:11.124 --> 00:34:13.845]  And those of us that aren't into evil, we have a blind spot for this.
[00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:18.846]  But we have to get a crash course in understanding what we're facing, and that means you're going to have to research it.
[00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:22.267]  And as citizen bloggers, you're going to have to write about it and talk about it.
[00:34:22.587 --> 00:34:25.508]  Because the New York Times is going to tell you, torture porn for women's great.
[00:34:26.088 --> 00:34:28.989]  They're going to tell you, the Pope covering up pedophilia is wonderful because he's a leftist.
[00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:34.050]  They're going to tell you, you know, the population against sterile is a good thing, because they're selling pure evil.
[00:34:35.971 --> 00:34:36.091]  Now,
[00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:43.140]  They're going to tell you bringing across thousands of people a day and them not being checked for diseases like Obama did is a good thing.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.121]  It's good for those people that have the diseases.
[00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:47.382]  It's good for those of you that get the diseases.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.242]  It's a Malthusian operation.
[00:34:50.642 --> 00:34:52.184]  Don't know what Malthusianism is?
[00:34:52.304 --> 00:34:53.505]  Let's put a definition on screen.
[00:34:54.046 --> 00:34:55.227]  Of Malthusianism.
[00:34:55.287 --> 00:34:56.509]  Not of who Malthus was.
[00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.911]  The definition of Malthusianism.
[00:34:58.932 --> 00:35:01.474]  Now I want to learn about Malthusianism.
[00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:02.656]  Malthusianism.
[00:35:03.156 --> 00:35:03.517]  Okay.
[00:35:03.937 --> 00:35:06.160]  Let's get to the big, gigantic enchilada.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:06.600]  Here it is.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.922]  Medical definition of Malthusian.
[00:35:08.977 --> 00:35:09.237]  I think?
[00:35:25.046 --> 00:35:26.507]  Degradation of the result.
[00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:27.668]  That's a little bit more than that.
[00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:44.980]  That's a whitewash of Malthus, but they're carrying out artificial Malthusianism, but actually targeting higher IQ populations that are seen as the, like a brother of a king secretly kills the king's son, so the brother becomes the king when he kills his brother.
[00:35:46.681 --> 00:35:51.785]  So lions will tend to kill the biggest male cub.
[00:35:53.927 --> 00:35:54.988]  Because they're threatened by it.
[00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:59.011]  There's hundreds of videos of the male lion.
[00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:06.516]  I mean, female lions have to protect the babies from the males because they'll come over, look at which one looks the most alpha, the strongest, and eat it.
[00:36:07.297 --> 00:36:09.639]  So see, that's the real eugenics going on.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.362]  And then, of course, they'll mop up everyone else a little bit later.
[00:36:14.682 --> 00:36:16.584]  Haven't changed their mind about killing all you as well.
[00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:19.446]  Now, let's go ahead and get back into all this.
[00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:21.232]  Here's the big news.
[00:36:21.252 --> 00:36:24.593]  You're like, Alex, you wrote articles about this 15, 20 years ago.
[00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:25.454]  You've covered it.
[00:36:25.614 --> 00:36:27.014]  Don't tell us something we don't already know.
[00:36:27.114 --> 00:36:30.095]  Oh, but see, it's big news because now it's in the news.
[00:36:31.176 --> 00:36:32.996]  Now it's in the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:34.237 --> 00:36:43.460]  Trump considering order to ban purchases of Huawei, if I'm saying it right, and ZTE equipment.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.321]  That's the second biggest cell phone maker in the world.
[00:36:46.641 --> 00:36:49.362]  It's the number one rollout of 5G.
[00:36:50.183 --> 00:36:51.624]  The Chinese government runs it.
[00:36:51.824 --> 00:36:53.705]  They're putting 5G out at cost.
[00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:57.927]  So it's being adopted here in the U.S.
[00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:00.848]  Most of your rural networks are on it and the Chinese government runs it.
[00:37:02.249 --> 00:37:08.372]  And it's designed to go into all your other appliances that are wireless and slurp up all of your data.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.061]  And leftist media has been attacking Trump.
[00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:13.542]  They really want the Chinese government to get this all in place.
[00:37:13.562 --> 00:37:16.864]  Now, here's the rest of the story, and Snowden exposes it and others.
[00:37:18.405 --> 00:37:29.371]  Key infrastructure chips made in the United States and shipped all over the world have similar things in it, but it's designed mainly to target critical infrastructure.
[00:37:30.097 --> 00:37:31.178]  That's a giant Trojan horse.
[00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:35.903]  But you see, the Chinese are the main maker of a lot of the chips, so they've known about this forever.
[00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:54.401]  You've got to have microscopic examination now of all of it, because a little bitty tiny chip, when you've got 5G, this is key, can then transmit to that, or the 5G, wait for it, this has been in the news for over a decade, 5G type technology energizes
[00:37:56.013 --> 00:38:06.747]  The transceiver, little microscopic transceivers, and so then they blurp the information back out at intervals to the 5G.
[00:38:08.249 --> 00:38:09.510]  So it doesn't yet be plugged in.
[00:38:10.785 --> 00:38:15.128]  This type of 5G stuff can pierce through NSA walls.
[00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:16.649]  It can pierce through CIA walls.
[00:38:17.009 --> 00:38:19.110]  And it's designed to just grab all your stuff up.
[00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.312]  And notice Google's joined with China.
[00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:22.752]  Apple's joined with China.
[00:38:22.772 --> 00:38:23.553]  They're all moving there.
[00:38:23.573 --> 00:38:27.155]  They won't even work with the Pentagon now because they believe China's already far advanced.
[00:38:27.495 --> 00:38:30.537]  We've been set up by Obama and others and basically handicapped.
[00:38:30.897 --> 00:38:32.839]  And so they believe America's already defeated.
[00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:49.376]  With their AI technology, with their artificial intelligence, with their systems, they believe, with the culture warfare they've set up and the fact that China is ahead of us in 5G and in AI, because the traitors in our own government did this, they believe we're beaten.
[00:38:49.976 --> 00:38:55.940]  And the average leftist says America was never great, it'll never be great, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:38:56.581 --> 00:39:00.444]  And they don't even know about China, they don't even care about political dissidents being killed, or they love it.
[00:39:02.082 --> 00:39:02.262]  I think?
[00:39:14.557 --> 00:39:15.717]  All sorts of scholarships.
[00:39:16.558 --> 00:39:17.358]  And that's why.
[00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:19.618]  China's the winner.
[00:39:19.658 --> 00:39:20.318]  China's God.
[00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:21.379]  China's unstoppable.
[00:39:21.399 --> 00:39:22.119]  The great dragon.
[00:39:22.379 --> 00:39:26.640]  And the people move to China, and they move back and forth, and they've got many, many traders.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.381]  Other people that are Chinese have family in China.
[00:39:29.961 --> 00:39:37.723]  Even if it's distant cousins, they threaten to kill them if they don't play ball and carry out work for the Communist Party.
[00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:41.844]  That's just one article we've got up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:43.144 --> 00:39:48.227]  And even Bloomberg a few months ago had the big cover and it said, you know, spy chips have been found in all of our electronics.
[00:39:48.668 --> 00:39:50.189]  Yeah, our military hardware, everything.
[00:39:50.229 --> 00:39:51.449]  We are seen as jokes.
[00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.391]  Because decades of traitors were setting us up.
[00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:58.053]  I mean, in the 90s, the Chinese couldn't get an ICBM off the ground.
[00:39:58.253 --> 00:39:59.014]  We gave them everything.
[00:39:59.874 --> 00:40:02.656]  And the guidance systems and the multiple reentry devices.
[00:40:03.977 --> 00:40:05.177]  We gave them everything.
[00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:07.459]  And so Trump is just
[00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:12.307]  You could almost say, just trying to negotiate that they use lubrication.
[00:40:13.487 --> 00:40:16.427]  And the globalists are like, we're not gonna use lubrication, we're gonna slit your damn throat.
[00:40:18.488 --> 00:40:20.248]  And the cucks, it's a spirit of cucking.
[00:40:21.408 --> 00:40:28.870]  I mean, and the left have such Stockholm Syndrome towards China and everything else that's un-American, and the Islamists and everything, they're just like, good, screw America, we hate it, yay China!
[00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.730]  China, when it fully takes over, they will be immediately annihilated.
[00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:36.651]  These, these traitors, these cucks.
[00:40:38.049 --> 00:40:41.570]  So there you go, and it's already been banned on a military basis.
[00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.750]  A bunch of other governments are banning it.
[00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.591]  Zero Hedge has an excellent article on it.
[00:40:46.591 --> 00:40:47.511]  It's incredibly serious.
[00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:49.792]  Of course, Russia has nothing to do with any of this, but that's why.
[00:40:49.852 --> 00:40:51.532]  They're the diversion tactic, see?
[00:40:53.893 --> 00:40:57.694]  Facebook slams dim operatives for using Russian bots to tilt
[00:40:59.474 --> 00:41:00.415]  Alabama election.
[00:41:01.276 --> 00:41:06.240]  And even AP has forced a report that Roy Moore didn't have any Russian bots.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.561]  That you could just go hire companies that just happen to be in Russia.
[00:41:08.922 --> 00:41:09.842]  Geography means nothing.
[00:41:10.183 --> 00:41:15.667]  And then have them act like they were doing pro-Russia, pro-Roy Moore, so CNN could run stories.
[00:41:15.907 --> 00:41:17.469]  That's called a false flag.
[00:41:17.549 --> 00:41:18.609]  A staged event.
[00:41:18.629 --> 00:41:21.312]  Of course, we played this yesterday.
[00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:26.396]  The top Canadian imam says that saying Merry Christmas is worse than murder.
[00:41:26.436 --> 00:41:28.477]  And that Christians are the enemy and we will be dealt with.
[00:41:31.237 --> 00:41:36.719]  There's so much more I haven't had time to get to yet, but we'll get to it all coming up today.
[00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:40.080]  Also, Vladimir Putin bows to his most dangerous enemy.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.140]  When we come back from break, is that really the case?
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.941]  Or what's really going on?
[00:41:43.961 --> 00:41:46.462]  Then we'll play Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[00:41:47.222 --> 00:41:52.964]  Again, I want to thank all the listeners that have made the broadcast possible and allow there to be something true and independent out there to fight back.
[00:41:53.284 --> 00:41:55.925]  And now it's more critical that we be here than ever.
[00:41:56.685 --> 00:41:59.526]  They're taking Savage off the radio and replacing him with a neocon.
[00:41:59.546 --> 00:42:00.306]  They're doing it all.
[00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.130]  They're making their move.
[00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:07.353]  Well, we have all the specials of Christmas until the end of the year.
[00:42:07.393 --> 00:42:08.313]  Just a few more days.
[00:42:08.373 --> 00:42:09.414]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:13.176]  Double Patriot points for your next order.
[00:42:13.196 --> 00:42:13.656]  50 to 75% off.
[00:42:14.556 --> 00:42:17.238]  And a free gift, because we ran out of all the t-shirts.
[00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:26.314]  In sizes extra large and large, so we grant all those as a free gift, but something of comparable value will be thrown into there.
[00:42:26.354 --> 00:42:29.156]  You cannot beat this deal, and your support is so critical.
[00:42:29.957 --> 00:42:38.422]  So if you want to get Brain Force or X2, or you want to get high-quality, storable foods, or you want to get water filtration or air filtration, just do the specials are the biggest ever.
[00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:41.504]  Year-end clearance sale, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:45.326 --> 00:42:48.207]  Alright, I'm gonna come back with Paul Watson's report on the latest on Putin.
[00:42:48.327 --> 00:42:49.827]  Is he bowing to his most dangerous enemy?
[00:42:50.187 --> 00:42:51.568]  Find out on the other side.
[00:42:52.048 --> 00:42:53.448]  It's InfoWars.com.
[00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:54.588]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:57.529]  Our only hope is that you spread that URL.
[00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:58.389]  If you do it, we win.
[00:42:58.429 --> 00:42:59.690]  If you don't, we're dead in the water.
[00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:00.750]  I'm in your hands.
[00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.110]  Stay with us.
[00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:09.332]  This past weekend, I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[00:43:10.643 --> 00:43:14.586]  And while I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald Living Section.
[00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:20.830]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe.
[00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.632]  It's all packaged very, very slickly.
[00:43:24.512 --> 00:43:34.800]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23, 2018, Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:41.863]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker right on your television, right?
[00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:43.043]  I'm not kidding.
[00:43:44.004 --> 00:43:49.486]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[00:43:50.666 --> 00:43:53.648]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:56.449]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[00:43:57.964 --> 00:43:59.445]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[00:44:00.005 --> 00:44:02.226]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college.
[00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:03.447]  And boys are depressed.
[00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:05.528]  And boys can't get jobs.
[00:44:05.628 --> 00:44:08.170]  And you know what the problem is?
[00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.450]  Boys are boys.
[00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:13.833]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish and how to be in dance class.
[00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:15.013]  That's right.
[00:44:15.033 --> 00:44:16.975]  We need to teach them how to be like girls.
[00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:24.332]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:29.421]  He worries that the people they interview in here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:34.031]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[00:44:35.132 --> 00:44:38.633]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:43.395]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[00:44:43.415 --> 00:44:50.258]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[00:44:50.978 --> 00:44:56.901]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[00:44:59.215 --> 00:45:02.637]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[00:45:02.657 --> 00:45:07.401]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.621]  Along with little girls.
[00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:18.607]  And they would then set the women up as the intermediary between the Romans and the local slave colonies.
[00:45:19.168 --> 00:45:30.516]  You've all heard of this in the classic images of southern plantations and slavery, where you'd have the large black woman who was in the house and the men were outside, and she was the one that kept an eye out for master.
[00:45:31.277 --> 00:45:32.177]  She was the one that
[00:45:33.078 --> 00:45:35.159]  Made sure everybody stayed in line.
[00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:38.461]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[00:45:39.602 --> 00:45:43.243]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[00:45:43.804 --> 00:45:45.485]  The whole human species is under attack.
[00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:53.713]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[00:45:54.513 --> 00:46:03.016]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:09.964]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[00:46:10.905 --> 00:46:24.354]  We're three or four generations into this, and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms and help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[00:46:25.194 --> 00:46:26.335]  That's how we're going to save them.
[00:46:27.216 --> 00:46:31.738]  Just like LBJ bragged 45 years ago that he'd have black people.
[00:46:32.919 --> 00:46:38.724]  Voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[00:46:39.705 --> 00:46:40.725]  And that's how they operate.
[00:46:41.386 --> 00:46:44.969]  The article's sickening and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[00:46:45.529 --> 00:46:50.413]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[00:46:50.513 --> 00:46:53.756]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[00:46:54.076 --> 00:46:57.358]  They're the ones destroying your identity while claiming they're protecting it.
[00:46:57.438 --> 00:47:01.742]  They're the ones telling you what to be while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[00:47:07.102 --> 00:47:16.429]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.015 --> 00:47:29.179]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.022]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.302 --> 00:47:47.424]  I was just in the studio, live, and I said, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to talk about Vladimir Putin and what his supposedly most powerful enemy is, according to CNN.
[00:47:47.785 --> 00:47:48.845]  And is that actually the case?
[00:47:49.865 --> 00:47:55.566]  But I wanted to just come in here and shoot the intro to this video we're about to play to get people thinking outside the box.
[00:47:56.586 --> 00:47:58.847]  I'm not just a guy on the radio or TV saying these things.
[00:47:58.887 --> 00:47:59.847]  This is really going on.
[00:48:00.247 --> 00:48:03.368]  I know most of you know that, but this isn't a spectator event.
[00:48:04.204 --> 00:48:12.289]  Even my own self, I fight the globalists so much that it almost becomes not that big a threat because I'm so close to it.
[00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:22.436]  Even though it's sterilizing me, even though it's giving me cancer, even though it's trying to kill me, even though the 5G, the globalism, the GMO, this whole system's attacking my children, your children.
[00:48:23.857 --> 00:48:26.118]  I'm almost adapting to accepting this environment.
[00:48:26.158 --> 00:48:27.079]  We should not accept it.
[00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:31.001]  We shouldn't just fight against it, we should absolutely not accept it.
[00:48:31.161 --> 00:48:33.423]  Because realize, they've got a drawing board set up for you and your family.
[00:48:34.824 --> 00:48:35.525]  They've got a plan.
[00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:39.608]  And if you're just accepting that plan, then you're not charting your own destiny.
[00:48:39.628 --> 00:48:49.296]  So let's all put a whiteboard on the wall somewhere in the house, the garage, wherever, and start writing our own goals for the universe and the world, and what we'd like to see happen versus what they'd like to see.
[00:48:49.396 --> 00:48:54.140]  And then, let's sit back and actually look at what the globalists are planning and what they're doing.
[00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:55.982]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:48:56.957 --> 00:49:01.059]  Mike Adams is coming up, and this next video ties into this.
[00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:07.301]  He's gonna get into the New York Times, the Washington Post, all of them, how great it'll be once there's no humans, how we're inherently bad.
[00:49:08.062 --> 00:49:09.242]  Thank God we're all going sterile.
[00:49:10.503 --> 00:49:11.143]  This is the plan.
[00:49:11.243 --> 00:49:13.104]  They're now rolling it out and telling you what they've done.
[00:49:13.744 --> 00:49:23.548]  And then you've got people like Vladimir Putin, who kicked the globalist out, who's trying to run programs for their people to have more children, who understands the globalists are trying to rewrite every culture.
[00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:28.766]  And he does see the number one threat to their country coming back as rap.
[00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:32.147]  And that's because the West weaponized rap, turned it into gangster rap.
[00:49:32.167 --> 00:49:33.147]  This has all been declassified.
[00:49:34.047 --> 00:49:41.869]  And they are sending it into nations, weaponized, to create a thug gangster culture.
[00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:43.790]  And it's spread all over the Middle East, Asia.
[00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.771]  It's a narcissistic, mentally ill, arrested development.
[00:49:49.756 --> 00:49:54.161]  Thug behavior of young males that have never had a real role model.
[00:49:54.501 --> 00:50:02.290]  So instead of having a good masculine role model, they go with the globalist, truly toxic male role model that inducts them into the prison system.
[00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:04.752]  So Putin knows if he says ban rap,
[00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:05.873]  That'll backfire.
[00:50:05.893 --> 00:50:22.460]  She used to say, well, it's very powerful, and some of it's good, some of it's bad, but it's also very, very dangerous, and it's got some anti-family, anti-woman messages, so that he can have a real conversation with the young people about the weaponized music of Pussy Riot and the rest of it being put into Russia.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:29.482]  And the fake rock and roll stuff hasn't worked, but this latest stuff is working, and it's also worked here in America.
[00:50:30.323 --> 00:50:31.223]  It was beta tested.
[00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:46.366]  And it's been beta tested in Europe and turned women into cucks that literally go and give sexual services to Islamists as other women get their heads cut off and raped and then other leftists apologize and say, you know, it's not your fault, I'm sorry.
[00:50:47.947 --> 00:50:51.529]  Courts are ruling that Muslim men can have sex with their children because it's their culture.
[00:50:51.629 --> 00:50:52.469]  It's so sick.
[00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:59.893]  And here's Paul Joseph Watson breaking down this mass cucking and how it's weaponized and how Russia is standing against it and we should too.
[00:51:01.383 --> 00:51:07.025]  Two female Scandinavian tourists were brutally murdered while hiking in Morocco's Atlas Mountains.
[00:51:07.045 --> 00:51:15.667]  24-year-old Dane Louisa Vesteraga-Jeppesen and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland were stabbed to death by suspected Islamic jihadists.
[00:51:15.787 --> 00:51:19.188]  And a horrific video shows Jeppesen being beheaded.
[00:51:19.268 --> 00:51:24.370]  Although the attack was likely sexually motivated, the killers later claimed allegiance to ISIS.
[00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.030]  And guess
[00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:29.634]  What one of the victims had previously posted on her Facebook page.
[00:51:29.774 --> 00:51:36.239]  A video showing a bearded Muslim man alongside the words, never judge people by their appearance.
[00:51:36.399 --> 00:51:43.825]  The video, a short film entitled Think for Yourself, shows a white woman looking at a bag carrying Muslim with suspicion.
[00:51:43.885 --> 00:51:47.448]  Plain clothed police officers then run out of the car towards the Muslim.
[00:51:47.568 --> 00:51:54.791]  Then they run straight past him and instead tackle a well-dressed white man with a briefcase before finding a bag full of drugs.
[00:51:54.971 --> 00:52:00.153]  The Muslim man then meets his family and the white woman realized what an Islamophobe she was.
[00:52:00.373 --> 00:52:05.815]  Never judge people by their appearance, the young blonde Scandinavian girl wrote on her Facebook before traveling to Morocco.
[00:52:06.195 --> 00:52:07.717]  Where she was decapitated.
[00:52:08.077 --> 00:52:11.120]  This is what the three men who did it looked like.
[00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:22.893]  Some people even reported that the mother of one of the victims in Morocco was posting love heart emojis aimed at Moroccans on Facebook just days after her daughter was brutally slaughtered.
[00:52:22.993 --> 00:52:26.177]  Swedish news outlets later reported that the rape and beheading
[00:52:26.397 --> 00:52:28.998]  Carried out by supporters of Islamic State?
[00:52:29.318 --> 00:52:30.678]  Had nothing to do with Islam.
[00:52:30.758 --> 00:52:35.920]  And so we observe yet another tragic case of cultural relativism.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.682]  The idea that a person's beliefs, values and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture rather than be judged against the criteria of another.
[00:52:45.802 --> 00:52:52.484]  How many times have we seen ardent progressives visit **** whole countries proclaiming love and peace to be universal
[00:52:53.184 --> 00:52:54.946]  Only for them to end up dead.
[00:52:55.086 --> 00:53:04.417]  Pippa Backer, the performance artist who said she would hitchhike from Italy to the Middle East to quote, send a message of peace and marriage between different peoples and nations.
[00:53:04.718 --> 00:53:11.285]  Her sister said, she thought that in the world there were more positive than negative people and that it was right to be trusting.
[00:53:11.445 --> 00:53:13.668]  When she got to Turkey, what happened to her?
[00:53:13.928 --> 00:53:15.289]  Raped and strangled to death.
[00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:24.075]  When news of her murder broke, authorities and the media were keen to downplay any connection to Turkey or any connection to the killer's belief system.
[00:53:24.135 --> 00:53:29.799]  Amanda Khajira, the liberal activist who travelled to Haiti to raise awareness about violence against women.
[00:53:29.919 --> 00:53:37.084]  She said she was, quote, committed to preserving the dignity of black men in a world which constantly stereotypes them as violent savages.
[00:53:37.304 --> 00:53:38.405]  What happened to her?
[00:53:38.565 --> 00:53:41.406]  Held on a rooftop and repeatedly raped by a black man.
[00:53:41.486 --> 00:53:46.068]  When she wrote about the experience after, guess who Amanda said was to blame?
[00:53:46.288 --> 00:53:52.331]  White man Ellen Krantz, a Swedish supporter of multiculturalism and a strong advocate of mass immigration.
[00:53:52.431 --> 00:53:57.034]  She was a member of a Facebook page called We Like Diversity.
[00:53:57.174 --> 00:53:58.454]  What happened to her?
[00:53:58.654 --> 00:54:02.016]  Raped and killed by an Ethiopian immigrant and dumped in a forest.
[00:54:02.236 --> 00:54:10.939]  Zayda Catalan, the Swedish Green Party politician who was a staunch advocate for open borders before visiting the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
[00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:12.120]  What happened to her?
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.641]  Beheaded and thrown in a shallow grave.
[00:54:14.661 --> 00:54:21.803]  20-year-old Ellie Warren, a left-wing environmentalist who visited Mozambique for the diving and for the, quote, pumping nightlife.
[00:54:22.003 --> 00:54:28.046]  According to her mother, she was, quote, just one of those girls that wanted to travel the world and see everything she could before she was 30.
[00:54:28.626 --> 00:54:33.510]  Warren had an insatiable desire to, quote, help others less fortunate than herself.
[00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:34.590]  What happened to her?
[00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.453]  Raped, murdered, and dumped in a toilet block.
[00:54:37.613 --> 00:54:45.318]  American Lauren M., working as an au pair in Austria, responded to a campaign encouraging people to take refugees and migrants into their own homes.
[00:54:45.439 --> 00:54:52.684]  She took in a Gambian migrant who had escaped from a local refugee center to escape deportation and had a warrant out for his arrest.
[00:54:52.864 --> 00:54:58.149]  Lauren gave the migrant a home despite him being previously accused of sexually assaulting a minor.
[00:54:58.249 --> 00:54:59.450]  What happened to her?
[00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.171]  Raped and suffocated to death.
[00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:07.537]  Belgian psychologist Millais Derrimaker worked with failed asylum seekers in Sweden to prevent their deportation.
[00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.418]  What happened to her?
[00:55:08.598 --> 00:55:11.560]  Mowed down by a truck driven by a failed asylum seeker.
[00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:16.224]  A female interpreter working on a documentary about the plight of vulnerable refugees.
[00:55:16.405 --> 00:55:17.285]  What happened to her?
[00:55:17.485 --> 00:55:18.787]  Raped by refugees.
[00:55:18.867 --> 00:55:26.053]  These cases are commonplace with NGOs and charities routinely covering them up so as not to stigmatise migrants.
[00:55:26.173 --> 00:55:30.036]  And then there was the left-wing couple who cycled through the Middle East and the Balkans.
[00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:33.198]  This is what they wrote before embarking on their journey.
[00:55:33.318 --> 00:55:37.220]  You read the papers and you're led to believe that the world is a big, scary place.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.362]  People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted.
[00:55:40.622 --> 00:55:41.382]  People are bad.
[00:55:41.662 --> 00:55:42.423]  People are evil.
[00:55:42.703 --> 00:55:43.463]  I don't buy it.
[00:55:43.704 --> 00:55:52.368]  Evil is a make-believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own.
[00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:56.671]  By and large, humans are kind, generous, and wonderful, and kind.
[00:55:57.071 --> 00:56:00.315]  No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.
[00:56:00.735 --> 00:56:01.756]  What happened to them?
[00:56:02.037 --> 00:56:04.540]  Ran over and stabbed to death by ISIS?
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.622]  Let's explore this case a bit more.
[00:56:06.662 --> 00:56:10.586]  Because despite what they said, I read their other travel blogs.
[00:56:10.646 --> 00:56:11.968]  And in almost every non-
[00:56:11.988 --> 00:56:17.250]  In the European country they visited, they were stalked, harassed, and threatened with physical harm.
[00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:32.196]  In Morocco, they were followed by weirdos trying to sell them drugs, called racist for not buying something from a street vendor, pushed off their bikes for refusing to take photos with people, and in one case, the guy was almost squished up against another car while trying to cross the road.
[00:56:32.276 --> 00:56:40.819]  The couple were tragically murdered in Tajikistan by Islamic State terrorists as part of a vehicle attack on seven Western tourists cycling through the Pamir Mountains.
[00:56:40.919 --> 00:56:44.920]  The murderers even made an ISIS propaganda tape before the slaughter.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:50.602]  So yes, evil does exist and there are evil people in the world.
[00:56:50.742 --> 00:56:58.545]  And some countries are more dangerous than others because some cultures and some belief systems are worse than others.
[00:56:58.725 --> 00:57:04.287]  Our negative view of some other cultures isn't just a product of our own ignorance and bigotry.
[00:57:04.407 --> 00:57:10.489]  It's a fair appraisal of what happens in those countries due to the attitudes of the people who live there.
[00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:15.991]  Does that mean that everyone in Morocco or Tajikistan is out to harass, attack or murder Western tourists?
[00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:17.172]  No, of course not!
[00:57:17.272 --> 00:57:18.492]  But that's not the issue.
[00:57:18.612 --> 00:57:23.895]  The issue is that leftists have embraced moral and cultural relativism.
[00:57:23.975 --> 00:57:32.158]  They've projected their own self-delusion that the world can be a utopia if we just all collectively believe it to be that way.
[00:57:32.338 --> 00:57:34.440]  No, the world doesn't work like that.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.062]  There are bad people in the world.
[00:57:36.442 --> 00:57:38.324]  Evil exists in the world.
[00:57:38.404 --> 00:57:45.452]  And no amount of wishy-washy, hashtag love-wins speciousness is ever going to change that fact.
[00:57:53.874 --> 00:57:57.518]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[00:57:58.419 --> 00:58:03.706]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:04.306 --> 00:58:05.888]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[00:58:06.769 --> 00:58:12.456]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[00:58:13.397 --> 00:58:22.780]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.080]  It's that simple.
[00:58:24.741 --> 00:58:25.661]  So, it's epic.
[00:58:25.761 --> 00:58:26.361]  It's amazing.
[00:58:26.601 --> 00:58:28.102]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[00:58:28.682 --> 00:58:31.103]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[00:58:32.723 --> 00:58:37.786]  This is the stuff of legends, and I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[00:58:38.386 --> 00:58:40.707]  You are not just part of the info war.
[00:58:41.287 --> 00:58:41.928]  You're the core.
[00:58:41.968 --> 00:58:42.528]  You're the heart.
[00:58:42.628 --> 00:58:43.268]  You're everything.
[00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:57.215]  It's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own
[00:59:00.004 --> 00:59:08.310]  Whatever it is, just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:09.851]  And again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:10.551]  I love you.
[00:59:11.652 --> 00:59:12.453]  I appreciate you.
[00:59:12.473 --> 00:59:14.514]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[00:59:15.195 --> 00:59:16.275]  I feel like you are me.
[00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:17.977]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[00:59:18.517 --> 00:59:24.301]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[00:59:24.762 --> 00:59:25.722]  What we're covering is
[00:59:26.883 --> 00:59:29.484]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[00:59:29.864 --> 00:59:31.865]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[00:59:32.245 --> 00:59:42.549]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and InfoWars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:43.230]  Do it.
[00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.450]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:48.231]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win.
[00:59:48.271 --> 00:59:50.232]  We're going to build an incredible world together.
[00:59:50.452 --> 00:59:51.833]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[00:59:54.795 --> 01:00:00.757]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:13.382]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[01:00:18.024 --> 01:00:20.866]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the second hour here.
[01:00:20.886 --> 01:00:22.688]  This is Mike Adams filling in today.
[01:00:22.728 --> 01:00:26.010]  I've got really just a huge collection of news for you.
[01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:41.362]  I'm going to give you a quick preview here of what I'll be covering with you over the next two hours, because despite the fact that a lot of people are, of course, on vacation, away from work, away from Washington, D.C., a lot of things are still happening.
[01:00:41.422 --> 01:00:42.263]  They are preparing
[01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:48.493]  For the accelerating assault on humanity in 2019 and beyond.
[01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:58.319]  The assault on Trump is kicking into high gear now with CNN and other left-wing media denouncing Trump for being loved by the troops.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:07.485]  So somehow this is now a crime to be a president who's loved by the military and dares to sign autographs on memorabilia.
[01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:09.005]  That's coming up as well.
[01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:20.508]  I'm going to talk about the so-called Green New Deal that's being pushed by socialist Democrats in Washington, D.C., and how that would turn America into Venezuela.
[01:01:21.668 --> 01:01:26.730]  Hemp legalization, of course, was assigned into law by President Trump a few days ago.
[01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:31.811]  I'm going to cover that and what it means for you and what it also means for the CBD market.
[01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:37.799]  Because still the FDA has restrictions on certain claims of CBDs.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.700]  You know, cannabinoids, cannabidiol in particular.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.381]  So I'll cover that as well.
[01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:56.384]  We've got the gun magazine ban in New Jersey and how there are at least a million residents of New Jersey who are refusing to turn in the gun magazines that have been banned and criminalized in New Jersey.
[01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:59.925]  So we have massive non-compliance taking place there.
[01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:09.218]  I'm going to talk about the border wall and a big segment today on the coming or the potential for an EMP wipeout.
[01:02:09.979 --> 01:02:16.004]  There's a new report from the United States government that talks about the potential for the collapse of the power grid.
[01:02:16.765 --> 01:02:18.246]  And again, this is a brand new report.
[01:02:18.306 --> 01:02:28.415]  I know we've covered this before in the past here on InfoWars, but this is a new report that takes a brand new look at it and warns that it could be the end of democracy as we know it.
[01:02:29.082 --> 01:02:36.205]  But specifically, I'm going to give you some new information about how to prepare yourself to survive such a collapse, should it happen.
[01:02:36.605 --> 01:02:43.648]  Because one of the things that I know that Alex wants to do, and that I want to do as well, is to give you practical solutions.
[01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:48.129]  I mean, it's one thing to talk about the problems, and we do need to highlight the problems.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.430]  We need to understand the risks of what's happening in our world.
[01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:51.731]  But at the same time,
[01:02:52.964 --> 01:02:55.505]  This can't be just listing all the problems.
[01:02:55.525 --> 01:03:01.828]  This has got to be a show about specific, detailed things that you can do that can save your life.
[01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:15.173]  So I'm going to have a preparedness and even a survival segment, you might say, in this show today, in the next two hours, about how to survive a power grid collapse and also some of the threats against the power grid.
[01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:16.234]  That's coming up.
[01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:22.829]  The overall message, though, is that the war against humanity has accelerated.
[01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:31.976]  It's now so bad that, as Alex mentioned in the previous hour, the globalists are now celebrating plunging human fertility.
[01:03:32.697 --> 01:03:35.099]  So now, it's all over the media.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:47.532]  When you see articles, they're talking about, oh, the human fertility is plunging, you know, sperm quality is down, women can't get pregnant, you have spontaneous abortions happening, populations are plummeting in first world nations.
[01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:50.174]  Now, the media is celebrating that.
[01:03:50.795 --> 01:03:51.976]  They say, oh, this is wonderful.
[01:03:52.648 --> 01:03:54.130]  This is great for the planet!
[01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:57.733]  And then you have the New York Times running an op-ed that said, oh, you know what?
[01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:01.977]  If humanity is exterminated, that's probably good for the planet.
[01:04:02.257 --> 01:04:14.129]  And so all the globalists and the left-wing media that have been talking about saving the planet this entire time, what they didn't tell you, but is now becoming apparent, is that
[01:04:14.782 --> 01:04:18.124]  They do plan to save the planet, just not for humans.
[01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:20.064]  They don't want any humans around.
[01:04:20.365 --> 01:04:22.806]  They don't want humans to be left on the planet.
[01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:26.727]  They plan to exterminate you in order to save the planet.
[01:04:27.088 --> 01:04:28.048]  That is their plan.
[01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:35.511]  And we've laid it out before, and I'll lay it out again today through many different stories as we continue here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:36.432]  This is Mike Adams.
[01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:45.780]  Filling in today, we've got a lot of breaking news ahead, a lot of analysis and practical information that can help save your life should things go wrong.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.523]  And it looks increasingly like that's going to happen.
[01:04:48.763 --> 01:04:51.826]  So stay tuned, follow this information, share it.
[01:04:52.446 --> 01:04:53.788]  It can literally help save your life.
[01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:54.668]  Much more straight ahead.
[01:04:54.688 --> 01:04:55.249]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:57.371]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:05.492]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:05:05.992 --> 01:05:07.173]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:08.794]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:05:09.234 --> 01:05:10.355]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:15.539]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.402]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:20.002 --> 01:05:28.048]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:28.989 --> 01:05:38.351]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:05:39.031 --> 01:05:42.932]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:05:42.992 --> 01:05:48.893]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:51.774]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:05:51.974 --> 01:05:53.214]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:53.474 --> 01:05:56.515]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:06:09.685 --> 01:06:15.747]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:16.407 --> 01:06:18.268]  It's Mike Adams.
[01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:21.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:28.714]  You will absolutely want to listen closely to the remainder of this show.
[01:06:28.754 --> 01:06:30.056]  I've got you for two hours here.
[01:06:30.096 --> 01:06:30.837]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:06:30.877 --> 01:06:32.299]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:32.839 --> 01:06:39.768]  I prepared just a huge collection of information that can literally, some of it can help save your life as things unfold.
[01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:42.251]  2019 is going to be a chaotic year.
[01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:44.192]  2020 as well.
[01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:48.536]  I mean, nothing is going to get easier from this day forward, so you need to be prepared.
[01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:53.540]  But let's start out this segment with a video that's gone viral.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.342]  I'm not going to play the video, just referencing it.
[01:06:55.902 --> 01:07:03.489]  This is a video that talks about, really, how the accelerating war on humanity is being waged by the vaccine industry.
[01:07:04.009 --> 01:07:09.254]  So this video, which InfoWars covered, and it's on Brighteon.com, the YouTube alternative,
[01:07:09.895 --> 01:07:14.877]  It's that triplets all became autistic after receiving vaccine shots.
[01:07:15.338 --> 01:07:28.704]  Now, what's remarkable about this video, it's two parents, I believe they're from Michigan, who several years ago, they had all their triplets, you know, three babies vaccinated at the same time.
[01:07:29.324 --> 01:07:31.665]  Within hours, those three babies all became
[01:07:32.566 --> 01:07:40.151]  Heavily autistic, severe autism, and they're still on the healing journey trying to recover the lives of those three children.
[01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:50.298]  But not only did this happen and which, by the way, it it's impossible for this to be coincidence, which is what the vaccine propagandists claim.
[01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:52.379]  They say, oh, this is just random chance.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.923]  Well, gosh, if it's if it's a one in a million chance for one baby to become autistic,
[01:07:59.369 --> 01:08:05.573]  What's the chance of three babies becoming autistic within hours who happen to be related?
[01:08:06.113 --> 01:08:12.696]  That's an astronomical risk assessment, astronomically low, basically zero.
[01:08:12.736 --> 01:08:17.799]  You probably have to have a billion universes for that to happen in one of them by sheer chance.
[01:08:18.159 --> 01:08:18.860]  It's not chance.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.060]  It's caused by the vaccines.
[01:08:20.401 --> 01:08:24.743]  But the remarkable thing about this story is that if you read the user comments,
[01:08:26.096 --> 01:08:34.181]  You have paid vaccine propagandist trolls who are claiming that the parents are crisis actors.
[01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:35.221]  Yes.
[01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:44.166]  Now, let's back up here for a second, because many of the attacks on Alex Jones and Infowars have claimed that he
[01:08:45.811 --> 01:08:53.734]  Was talking about, you know, crisis actors or parents going on camera and maybe exaggerating certain events in the past.
[01:08:54.114 --> 01:08:59.876]  And Alex was just viciously smeared and attacked over the accusation that he said there were crisis actors.
[01:09:00.197 --> 01:09:08.220]  Well, now the vaccine industry says that all parents whose children are damaged by vaccines, that those parents are crisis actors.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.202]  So now crisis actors is the excuse of the vaccine establishment.
[01:09:14.722 --> 01:09:16.145]  Of the science establishment.
[01:09:16.766 --> 01:09:20.494]  They say that parents whose children are damaged by vaccines are lying.
[01:09:20.775 --> 01:09:21.957]  They say they're paid actors.
[01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:24.867]  Where is the media outrage against this?
[01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:32.971]  Where is the Associated Press claiming that, oh, why is the vaccine industry claiming these parents are crisis actors?
[01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:35.353]  Doesn't the vaccine industry care about these children?
[01:09:35.773 --> 01:09:36.733]  These children are harmed.
[01:09:37.054 --> 01:09:47.339]  Where is the nationwide media outrage against the vaccine industry to reflect the fabricated media outrage that was directed against Alex Jones?
[01:09:47.579 --> 01:09:49.440]  You see, it's always a double standard.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.381]  It's always hypocrisy.
[01:09:52.532 --> 01:09:55.413]  You and I know that vaccines harm children.
[01:09:55.853 --> 01:09:56.553]  In fact, the U.S.
[01:09:56.573 --> 01:09:57.693]  government knows that as well.
[01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:08.796]  The government publishes, every quarter, updated statistics on the number of children who have been harmed, maimed, hospitalized, put into comas, and even killed by vaccines.
[01:10:09.256 --> 01:10:15.978]  That government database is called VAERS, VAERS, or Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System.
[01:10:16.624 --> 01:10:17.585]  It's part of the U.S.
[01:10:17.605 --> 01:10:17.965]  government.
[01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:19.907]  You can go to the VAERS website.
[01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:20.847]  It's easy to search for.
[01:10:21.128 --> 01:10:30.175]  And you can download a spreadsheet that details how many children have been maimed and killed by vaccines and the specific causes of what happened to those children.
[01:10:31.156 --> 01:10:34.979]  The government has a vaccine injury compensation program, a secret court.
[01:10:35.956 --> 01:10:38.197]  That was authorized by Congress decades ago.
[01:10:38.517 --> 01:10:43.320]  The Secret Court has paid out over $3 billion to parents of vaccine-damaged children.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.562]  The same parents that the vaccine industry claims now are crisis actors.
[01:10:48.423 --> 01:10:59.949]  So, just to summarize here, if you are a parent of children, a parent of multiple children, and you take those children to be vaccinated, and you think, oh, I'm doing my duty.
[01:11:00.269 --> 01:11:02.390]  I'm doing what I'm told to do by the government.
[01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.631]  I'm being a good citizen.
[01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:10.282]  I'm going in to have these children immunized so they don't spread disease, and you think you're being obedient.
[01:11:10.863 --> 01:11:19.209]  You're going to have a high social score because the government loves what you're doing, and then those children become autistic just hours after the vaccination.
[01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:24.513]  If you go public with that as a parent, suddenly you are an enemy of the state.
[01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:26.590]  Suddenly, you are smeared.
[01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:27.851]  You are lied about.
[01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:31.894]  You are called a crisis actor because your children have been damaged.
[01:11:32.234 --> 01:11:36.657]  Not only that, they call you a liar and say your children weren't damaged by vaccines at all.
[01:11:36.677 --> 01:11:37.838]  It must be something you did.
[01:11:37.878 --> 01:11:38.878]  You're a bad parent.
[01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:42.041]  And then if you try to sue the vaccine manufacturers, guess what?
[01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:42.701]  The U.S.
[01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:44.562]  Supreme Court says, oh, you can't sue them.
[01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:49.766]  They've been granted legal immunity that supersedes the United States Supreme Court.
[01:11:50.382 --> 01:11:53.183]  You can't file a lawsuit in the regular court system.
[01:11:53.423 --> 01:12:02.745]  You have to go to the kangaroo vaccine court, where you probably can't prove that your child was damaged by this vaccine, and you may never get a payout.
[01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:16.349]  This is the state of the vaccine industry today, and it's just one vector among many vectors where we have attacks on children, attacks on humanity, attacks on reproduction.
[01:12:17.094 --> 01:12:23.339]  Sexual reproduction, a man and a woman getting together and creating a new human life, a human baby.
[01:12:23.979 --> 01:12:27.082]  Even that is now under attack in our country today.
[01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:29.143]  I've got a story here.
[01:12:30.224 --> 01:12:30.584]  Where is it?
[01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:40.892]  Where Planned Parenthood is now discriminating against its own employees who are pregnant because the sight of a pregnant
[01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:48.718]  A woman, a child inside that woman, in her womb, that's offensive to Planned Parenthood.
[01:12:49.118 --> 01:12:50.059]  They want dead babies.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.701]  They want to kill the babies.
[01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:53.002]  They don't want living babies.
[01:12:53.082 --> 01:12:57.186]  Living babies are the antithesis of what Planned Parenthood stands for.
[01:12:59.781 --> 01:13:01.883]  I just published an article on Natural News yesterday.
[01:13:01.903 --> 01:13:15.195]  It says, it talks about which corporations are funding the mass murder of black babies in America, and it lists the corporations that are funding Planned Parenthood, and those include pharmaceutical companies.
[01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:28.364]  Those include big, powerful corporations, and they are funding this effort for Planned Parenthood to open more abortion centers, especially in black neighborhoods and low-income communities across America.
[01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:31.706]  And you want to tell me that that's just coincidence?
[01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:33.247]  Give me a break!
[01:13:34.396 --> 01:13:39.878]  Vaccines harm children, abortion kills children, and the abortion industry targets black babies.
[01:13:40.278 --> 01:13:55.083]  And by the way, it was a whistleblower inside the CDC who went public years ago saying that the CDC covered up the science that showed that vaccines specifically damage African-American infants more than white babies, for example.
[01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:58.204]  It's the black babies that are made more autistic.
[01:13:58.744 --> 01:14:00.505]  A higher risk of autism.
[01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:05.529]  Hundreds of percent higher risk for black babies compared to white babies.
[01:14:05.749 --> 01:14:07.630]  That was swept under the rug.
[01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:09.711]  That was eliminated.
[01:14:10.032 --> 01:14:13.414]  That the science was covered up and the media was ordered what to say.
[01:14:13.434 --> 01:14:22.860]  And they blacklisted the entire story, didn't report on the scientist, never said a thing about that, hoping that you wouldn't know the truth.
[01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:23.981]  Hoping that
[01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:36.491]  You know, all the African-American families across America who are being targeted for depopulation and eugenics, population reduction, that they wouldn't know because it wasn't reported in the mainstream media.
[01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:38.252]  MSNBC never covers this.
[01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:39.412]  CNN never covers this.
[01:14:39.852 --> 01:14:42.593]  And they hope you just don't know that you are being murdered.
[01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:43.794]  You are being wiped out.
[01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:45.675]  It is genocide.
[01:14:46.295 --> 01:14:47.335]  It is genocide.
[01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:52.417]  It's like in Africa, the tribes commit genocide against each other using machetes.
[01:14:53.132 --> 01:14:56.496]  In America, the genocide is carried out through medicine.
[01:14:57.217 --> 01:15:00.461]  That's right, violent medicine, or medical tyranny.
[01:15:00.841 --> 01:15:04.986]  It's the vaccines, it's the abortions, which are called, you know, women's health issues.
[01:15:05.447 --> 01:15:13.096]  And also, by the way, it's the cancer industry that targets black people in particular, because having dark skin makes you vitamin D deficient.
[01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:21.798]  Which means you have more aggressive prostate cancer, more aggressive breast cancer, and you are a cash machine from the point of view of the cancer industry.
[01:15:22.078 --> 01:15:28.839]  They see a black man or a black woman walk through that door, and in their minds, they're like, oh, let's shake this person.
[01:15:28.859 --> 01:15:32.420]  Let's shake the money out of their pockets and shake the money out of the Medicare system.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.960]  Shake the money out of the U.S.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.461]  government to treat this person for cancer and never tell them the truth that they can prevent it with vitamin D.
[01:15:40.532 --> 01:15:40.932]  That's right.
[01:15:41.373 --> 01:15:42.593]  You are the medical experiment.
[01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:44.615]  You are targeted for extermination.
[01:15:45.095 --> 01:15:47.237]  And it's only going to get worse in the next year.
[01:15:47.257 --> 01:15:52.900]  When we come back, I'll give you more details about this war on humanity that is being waged right now.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.042]  This is Mike Adams for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:55.062 --> 01:15:55.522]  Stay with us.
[01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:04.188]  Tucker Carlson.
[01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:16.004]  The number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a patriot and a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones'd right now in front of all of us.
[01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:27.437]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[01:16:28.764 --> 01:16:35.973]  It came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[01:16:36.613 --> 01:16:37.915]  He was right under me on the list.
[01:16:38.796 --> 01:16:44.643]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson, that's why.
[01:16:45.936 --> 01:16:47.417]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:50.260]  I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[01:16:50.861 --> 01:16:53.843]  He was already, obviously, covering all that on air.
[01:16:54.724 --> 01:16:58.187]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[01:16:58.768 --> 01:17:02.592]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[01:17:04.059 --> 01:17:11.442]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[01:17:11.922 --> 01:17:18.844]  And the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[01:17:19.645 --> 01:17:25.387]  But today we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the U.S.
[01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:41.361]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[01:17:42.702 --> 01:17:44.282]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[01:17:45.043 --> 01:17:49.925]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes unaccompanied.
[01:17:49.945 --> 01:17:53.687]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[01:17:55.043 --> 01:18:01.629]  If we go back to 10 years ago, it seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about 8-9 million viewers a night.
[01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.171]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[01:18:04.512 --> 01:18:05.813]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[01:18:06.774 --> 01:18:07.635]  And what was he talking about?
[01:18:07.755 --> 01:18:12.179]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[01:18:12.219 --> 01:18:13.340]  He was going off their own documents.
[01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:19.241]  Lou Dobbs was taken off the air because he was number one, because he was telling the truth that he was a patriot.
[01:18:19.502 --> 01:18:24.006]  Now he's relegated to Fox Business with maybe a million viewers.
[01:18:24.026 --> 01:18:26.588]  And Tucker Carlson is next, and then Sean Hannity.
[01:18:27.029 --> 01:18:29.952]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:36.515]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[01:18:37.076 --> 01:18:40.998]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[01:18:41.038 --> 01:18:44.980]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.882]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:51.824]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[01:18:51.964 --> 01:18:58.728]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:05.554]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[01:19:06.054 --> 01:19:11.838]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[01:19:11.898 --> 01:19:17.603]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas, because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[01:19:18.874 --> 01:19:22.535]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:33.880]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous, where San Francisco jury's letting an illegal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white, we have diversity signal.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.641]  This is the real cancer.
[01:19:36.442 --> 01:19:45.489]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds at gay bars, have little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[01:19:45.849 --> 01:19:51.174]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[01:19:51.974 --> 01:19:54.497]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[01:19:54.997 --> 01:19:57.059]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:19:57.199 --> 01:19:59.160]  Just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[01:20:06.472 --> 01:20:09.108]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:30.367]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.407 --> 01:20:31.987]  Thank you for continuing with me today.
[01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:37.749]  Mike Adams here, the founder of Brighteon.com, Natural News, you know, many different projects.
[01:20:37.789 --> 01:20:39.670]  We are all working for humanity.
[01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:40.970]  That's the big picture here.
[01:20:41.471 --> 01:20:50.314]  InfoWars, you know, all of my publishing websites, many other independent journalists, we're all working for humanity, even as the globalists are trying to destroy humanity.
[01:20:50.354 --> 01:20:53.915]  In fact, during the break, I was just thinking, the most offensive thing
[01:20:55.403 --> 01:21:22.923]  From the point of view of a globalist, the most offensive thing that they could see is a baby being born, a human being born alive and healthy with its neurology intact, ready to learn, ready to absorb, ready to grow into an adult, to innovate, to be creative, to help create a future of individual liberty and productivity, you know, innovation and abundance.
[01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:26.519]  That is the most offensive thing to a globalist.
[01:21:27.039 --> 01:21:29.359]  First, they want to kill the baby before it's born.
[01:21:29.959 --> 01:21:34.900]  And then once it's born, they want to hit it with a huge number of vaccines to cause neurological damage.
[01:21:35.381 --> 01:21:46.083]  And then, if that doesn't work quite enough, they want to inundate that adult with fake news, hoax information, media indoctrination to keep you down.
[01:21:46.872 --> 01:21:57.580]  To keep you trapped in a mental prison that they are building for you every single day, at the same time that they are celebrating the drop in human fertility.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.262]  And that's the big story for this segment.
[01:22:00.322 --> 01:22:06.747]  Globalists call for the celebration of plunging human fertility as the war against humanity accelerates.
[01:22:06.767 --> 01:22:11.871]  Let me read you some details from this story which appeared in The Guardian out of the UK.
[01:22:12.872 --> 01:22:15.614]  And the story quotes a so-called expert
[01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:18.946]  Her name is Sarah Harper.
[01:22:19.066 --> 01:22:33.289]  She is a director of the Royal Institution, who says that far from igniting alarm and panic, falling total fertility rates were to be embraced, and countries should not worry if their population is not growing.
[01:22:33.969 --> 01:22:41.951]  And astonishingly, the reason that she cites for this is the rise of artificial intelligence and illegal immigration.
[01:22:42.571 --> 01:22:44.271]  In other words, from the point of view of globalists,
[01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:46.412]  They don't need you anymore.
[01:22:47.112 --> 01:23:05.844]  All you first world people, all you Americans and Western Europeans and people who have created an incredible array of knowledge through mathematics and science and the arts and all these amazing contributions to human knowledge through thousands of years.
[01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:13.558]  Of European innovation and then later on American innovation and North America and Canada as well.
[01:23:14.039 --> 01:23:16.000]  All of you are now expendable.
[01:23:17.121 --> 01:23:22.245]  The globalists have decided that you need to be overrun with illegal immigrants.
[01:23:22.285 --> 01:23:25.307]  You can't even call them immigrants because they didn't really immigrate.
[01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:26.888]  They're occupiers.
[01:23:26.908 --> 01:23:29.710]  They're foreign nationals who just rush in and occupy your country.
[01:23:30.891 --> 01:23:32.812]  And if that's not good enough, don't worry.
[01:23:33.012 --> 01:23:34.934]  The AI systems are going to take over soon.
[01:23:35.632 --> 01:23:37.192]  So they don't need you anymore.
[01:23:37.733 --> 01:23:38.913]  AI will run the world.
[01:23:39.713 --> 01:23:54.918]  Any of you who want to be saved, I guess you could sign up to have your, quote, consciousness transferred to a machine, which, by the way, is just a form of euthanasia where they create an artificial computer avatar that tries to simulate the way you talk and the way you look.
[01:23:55.618 --> 01:23:56.238]  It's not you.
[01:23:56.438 --> 01:23:57.619]  Your soul isn't in there.
[01:23:57.639 --> 01:23:58.839]  It's just a simulation.
[01:23:59.443 --> 01:24:03.284]  But if you want to sign up to be quote transferred to a machine, go for it.
[01:24:03.364 --> 01:24:06.265]  It's just just a complex form of techno suicide.
[01:24:06.285 --> 01:24:12.827]  They're just going to inject you with the same chemicals that they would inject like a mass murderer on death row.
[01:24:13.187 --> 01:24:17.388]  Yeah, you can you can be killed by the state and quote transferred to a machine if you believe that.
[01:24:19.084 --> 01:24:20.405]  I call it natural selection.
[01:24:20.825 --> 01:24:26.307]  If you think that that's going to make you live forever, you know, go for it, because it's actually mass death.
[01:24:26.387 --> 01:24:28.707]  That's the killing of people when they roll that out.
[01:24:28.727 --> 01:24:29.468]  It's coming, by the way.
[01:24:30.488 --> 01:24:44.773]  But this idea that plunging fertility is good is consistent now with the idea that the extermination of humankind is desirable by the globalists because they have to save the planet.
[01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:48.034]  Now, there's a really important linguistic trick happening here.
[01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:59.374]  When these people on the left and these people in the left-wing media, when they say, oh, we have to save the planet, you assume that they mean saving it for humans.
[01:25:00.114 --> 01:25:05.119]  You assume that they mean, yeah, we're going to still be here and we're going to save the planet.
[01:25:05.539 --> 01:25:07.000]  But they're not saying that at all.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.561]  That's not even what they mean.
[01:25:09.022 --> 01:25:12.905]  They're not talking about saving the planet for you and your children and your grandchildren.
[01:25:13.185 --> 01:25:15.988]  They're talking about saving the planet from you.
[01:25:16.977 --> 01:25:17.718]  From you.
[01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:18.359]  Do you understand?
[01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:22.864]  They're talking about exterminating humankind in order to save the planet.
[01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:30.253]  And the thing is, these globalists who are going along with this, they think that somehow they will be spared.
[01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:31.154]  That they're special.
[01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:33.497]  They're the global elite, after all.
[01:25:35.245 --> 01:25:44.090]  Yeah, all the rest of humanity could be exterminated, they believe, but they are going to be spared because, well, because they've gone along with the agenda.
[01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.431]  They've helped to betray humanity.
[01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:49.273]  They've helped to exterminate humankind.
[01:25:49.293 --> 01:25:50.874]  They've helped push abortion.
[01:25:51.434 --> 01:25:53.295]  They've pushed the vaccines that damage babies.
[01:25:53.335 --> 01:25:54.996]  They've pushed the fluoride in the water supply.
[01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:58.759]  They've pushed the GMOs and the mass poisoning of humanity.
[01:25:58.919 --> 01:25:59.459]  Look at this.
[01:25:59.539 --> 01:26:00.019]  Here's a headline.
[01:26:00.039 --> 01:26:00.500]  Just interrupt.
[01:26:02.196 --> 01:26:08.721]  First ever comprehensive project finds that 93% of Americans have glyphosate in their bodies.
[01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:11.783]  Glyphosate, that's the cancer-causing herbicide.
[01:26:12.163 --> 01:26:15.425]  And it's sprayed on foods in the field.
[01:26:15.585 --> 01:26:16.726]  It's sprayed on wheat crops.
[01:26:16.786 --> 01:26:17.807]  It's sprayed on oats.
[01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:18.868]  It's sprayed on barley.
[01:26:19.308 --> 01:26:30.616]  If you're not buying organic wheat and organic oats and organic even lentils and legumes and millet and rye and all these grains that are grown in fields like that, if you're not buying organic,
[01:26:31.388 --> 01:26:32.289]  You're eating glyphosate.
[01:26:32.889 --> 01:26:34.051]  And it's all by design.
[01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:36.573]  You see, those aren't even GMO crops.
[01:26:37.273 --> 01:26:39.155]  They don't need to spray them with glyphosate.
[01:26:39.556 --> 01:26:43.519]  They are doing it on purpose to contaminate the food supply.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:51.466]  And that's why studies are now showing 93% of Americans have glyphosate in their bodies.
[01:26:51.587 --> 01:26:54.189]  That's a study out of the University of California, San Francisco.
[01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:56.211]  Urine samples.
[01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:07.255]  Now, let me bring in a little bit of science on this, because I run a lab, I test for glyphosate, I run mass spec instruments, and we can look at glyphosate down to one part per billion.
[01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:26.606]  If glyphosate is found in the urine of people, the urine, follow me here, this is very important, it means that it survives digestion, it means that it goes into your blood, which means that it goes into your brain, it passes the blood-brain barrier, it goes into your tissues, and it goes through your kidneys,
[01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:29.811]  And your bladder, and eventually comes out in your urine.
[01:27:30.172 --> 01:27:36.375]  If they're finding it in your urine, that means glyphosate is everywhere in your body that there are living cells.
[01:27:37.015 --> 01:27:39.296]  So your heart is contaminated with glyphosate.
[01:27:39.436 --> 01:27:41.577]  Your eyeballs have it.
[01:27:42.078 --> 01:27:50.102]  Every organ, your liver, your lungs, your reproductive organs, your digestive system, it's all contaminated with glyphosate.
[01:27:51.078 --> 01:27:55.202]  This is being done on purpose, and that molecule survives digestion.
[01:27:55.622 --> 01:28:02.528]  So, if you're not buying organic on those crops, then, you know, you're definitely eating a massive amount of glyphosate.
[01:28:04.049 --> 01:28:05.971]  By the way, we did a quick calculation at the lab.
[01:28:06.491 --> 01:28:16.100]  Eating one piece of bread, wheat bread, that's not organic, if that wheat was sprayed with glyphosate, that could expose you to more glyphosate than eating a hundred apples.
[01:28:16.863 --> 01:28:20.705]  Because apples and fresh fruit normally don't have hardly any glyphosate in them.
[01:28:21.085 --> 01:28:21.805]  It's the grains.
[01:28:22.486 --> 01:28:26.468]  One slice of bread versus a hundred apples.
[01:28:26.528 --> 01:28:27.128]  Think about that!
[01:28:27.548 --> 01:28:29.369]  But this is part of the assault on humanity.
[01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:30.510]  This is what they're doing.
[01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:31.650]  It's the mass poisoning.
[01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:32.771]  It's the mass...
[01:28:34.558 --> 01:28:35.058]  Abortions.
[01:28:35.279 --> 01:28:38.401]  It's the idea that globalists hate the sight of a human baby.
[01:28:38.782 --> 01:28:52.795]  And soon, mark my words, parents who have babies are going to be vilified in society and penalized with a social scoring system that denies them home loans and maybe public transportation, China style.
[01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:53.616]  That's coming.
[01:28:54.336 --> 01:28:55.177]  Much more straight ahead.
[01:28:55.337 --> 01:28:56.218]  I've got a lot more to share with you.
[01:28:56.238 --> 01:28:56.679]  Stay with us.
[01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:58.761]  This is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:04.124 --> 01:29:05.985]  We're ending the year.
[01:29:06.365 --> 01:29:07.325]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:08.346]  It's been an insane year.
[01:29:09.646 --> 01:29:17.209]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:29.254]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[01:29:30.294 --> 01:29:31.095]  And that the globalists
[01:29:32.199 --> 01:29:38.464]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[01:29:39.525 --> 01:29:43.909]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[01:29:43.929 --> 01:29:46.611]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:48.913]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:52.475]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[01:29:52.496 --> 01:29:54.857]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[01:29:55.718 --> 01:29:58.340]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[01:29:59.721 --> 01:30:01.102]  But our aircraft didn't have
[01:30:02.782 --> 01:30:05.003]  Radar.
[01:30:05.183 --> 01:30:16.268]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[01:30:16.488 --> 01:30:26.973]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[01:30:28.074 --> 01:30:30.055]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:34.099]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[01:30:35.019 --> 01:30:42.221]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:45.801]  For as we're showing, it's Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[01:30:45.861 --> 01:30:46.882]  That's a separate battle.
[01:30:47.662 --> 01:30:47.882]  And so...
[01:30:54.946 --> 01:30:59.710]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[01:31:00.211 --> 01:31:02.973]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[01:31:03.854 --> 01:31:09.238]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[01:31:10.119 --> 01:31:17.706]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[01:31:19.619 --> 01:31:23.304]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:29.974]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[01:31:30.034 --> 01:31:33.899]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:43.817]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[01:31:44.217 --> 01:31:45.599]  We've got whatever the best is.
[01:31:45.639 --> 01:31:57.229]  I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[01:31:57.449 --> 01:31:59.171]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[01:32:00.157 --> 01:32:08.402]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[01:32:09.142 --> 01:32:14.345]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[01:32:14.865 --> 01:32:18.327]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job, too.
[01:32:19.087 --> 01:32:26.431]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[01:32:26.912 --> 01:32:29.073]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[01:32:29.813 --> 01:32:32.177]  Until the end of this year.
[01:32:33.059 --> 01:32:41.193]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[01:32:42.245 --> 01:32:44.887]  And of course, so many other great items.
[01:32:44.947 --> 01:32:50.711]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:55.013]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[01:32:55.354 --> 01:32:56.394]  A true 360 win.
[01:32:56.794 --> 01:32:58.275]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:32:58.456 --> 01:33:00.137]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:09.102]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.295 --> 01:33:28.459]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.899 --> 01:33:32.182]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:38.546]  We're talking with the crew during the break.
[01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:40.367]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:42.168]  Mike Adams filling in here today.
[01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:48.292]  You know, I'm a lab scientist and some members of the crew who are just outstanding.
[01:33:48.312 --> 01:33:50.173]  They do a great job every day, by the way.
[01:33:51.273 --> 01:33:55.436]  It's amazing that they can pull up all the stories in real time as I'm talking about subjects.
[01:33:55.836 --> 01:33:59.038]  They're asking me about the glyphosate is a chelator.
[01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:09.244]  Which means that it binds with metals or minerals, which are many minerals are metals or transition metals as we call them on the table of elements.
[01:34:09.965 --> 01:34:12.105]  And they're asking me maybe to explain this a little more.
[01:34:12.245 --> 01:34:13.966]  Why glyphosate is so toxic?
[01:34:14.386 --> 01:34:15.567]  Why does it cause cancer?
[01:34:16.167 --> 01:34:19.388]  Well, it causes cancer through many different mechanisms, but
[01:34:20.473 --> 01:34:23.676]  Binding with the trace minerals is one of them.
[01:34:24.156 --> 01:34:26.858]  So you need trace minerals to prevent cancer.
[01:34:26.878 --> 01:34:27.739]  You need selenium.
[01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:28.819]  You need zinc.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.401]  You need very small amounts of copper.
[01:34:31.902 --> 01:34:36.845]  And there are other minerals that are important, such as magnesium, which is more of a macro mineral.
[01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:39.788]  But selenium and zinc in particular.
[01:34:39.868 --> 01:34:41.829]  Zinc supports skin healing.
[01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:44.992]  Zinc prevents influenza infections.
[01:34:45.452 --> 01:34:47.934]  Without zinc, your immune system can't function correctly.
[01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:55.874]  And without selenium, the glutathione cycle for detoxification can't really function correctly as well.
[01:34:56.194 --> 01:35:03.518]  So you need these trace minerals, yet when you eat glyphosate, glyphosate's a chelator, which means it binds with those minerals, i.e.
[01:35:03.578 --> 01:35:03.878]  metals,
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:26.111]  And then it rips them out of your system and eliminates them out of your body as what we call in the form of complex glyphosate, which would be glyphosate, the molecule, plus some cluster of atoms that contains that metal element, or perhaps glyphosate bound simply to a metal ion through an ionic bond.
[01:35:26.652 --> 01:35:28.253]  Glyphosate does this all the time.
[01:35:28.293 --> 01:35:29.333]  It's well known to do this.
[01:35:30.094 --> 01:35:32.655]  In effect, glyphosate causes nutritional deficiencies.
[01:35:33.399 --> 01:35:37.948]  That can lead you or make you vulnerable to cancer, make you vulnerable to influenza infections.
[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:45.122]  You know, the vaccine industry always talks about, oh, people who don't get vaccinated are irresponsible because they're spreading influenza.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.180]  Nonsense!
[01:35:46.601 --> 01:35:53.507]  It's people who are eating glyphosate are actually more susceptible to influenza because now they're zinc deficient and they're selenium deficient.
[01:35:53.847 --> 01:35:57.290]  And cancer growth can be accelerated because of that deficiency.
[01:35:57.650 --> 01:36:07.279]  So if someone's already, let's say, vitamin D deficient, which is very common in the winter months because of, of course, the lack of sunlight, or those of you who have dark skin pigmentation,
[01:36:07.819 --> 01:36:11.021]  You're not getting much vitamin D anyway because you have natural sunblock.
[01:36:11.041 --> 01:36:13.362]  You're blocking UV radiation from the sun.
[01:36:13.862 --> 01:36:24.088]  You're not generating vitamin D. And then if you eat glyphosate on top of that, that glyphosate is just ripping selenium out of your body and it's ripping zinc and copper and other metals out of your body.
[01:36:24.388 --> 01:36:29.391]  You are literally peeing away your nutrition if you eat glyphosate.
[01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:31.718]  And glyphosate is well known to do this.
[01:36:31.758 --> 01:36:45.300]  In fact, we have to use, in the laboratory, glyphosate is so sensitive to metals, we actually have to use a special chelation solution to clean out the chemistry column in the liquid chromatography segment of our lab.
[01:36:45.891 --> 01:36:55.837]  Clean it out and get rid of trace levels of metal ions before we can even run glyphosate through that chromatography column and then quantitate it on the mass spec instrument.
[01:36:56.218 --> 01:36:59.940]  We have to go through a special process because glyphosate will bind to metals.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:01.801]  So we see it every day.
[01:37:02.281 --> 01:37:08.665]  This is a well-known feature or toxic property, you might say, of glyphosate.
[01:37:08.886 --> 01:37:11.287]  And this is also why it kills plants so effectively.
[01:37:11.687 --> 01:37:12.468]  Glyphosate is
[01:37:13.762 --> 01:37:17.285]  It starves the roots of plants of the nutrients that they need to survive.
[01:37:17.805 --> 01:37:22.448]  The roots die, and then the plant dies after the roots die.
[01:37:23.148 --> 01:37:27.391]  Well, a similar thing is happening in your body, although through a different biological mechanism.
[01:37:28.372 --> 01:37:31.814]  If you kill your nutrition, you will die sooner or later as well.
[01:37:31.834 --> 01:37:41.180]  It's not as rapid as with a plant, because this chemical is engineered specifically for plants, but it does have a chelation effect that can leave you nutritionally deficient.
[01:37:42.854 --> 01:37:48.876]  With that in mind, you know, speaking of nutrition, let me just mention, you want to keep the show going?
[01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:51.097]  You want to support this network?
[01:37:52.137 --> 01:38:00.260]  Look, this is the independent hub of information for America and the world, and that's why I'm on here sharing this message that's important for humanity.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:07.102]  Alex Jones doesn't have a boss, and I don't have a boss either, and that's why you're getting the straight truth from us.
[01:38:08.166 --> 01:38:09.206]  But there are costs involved.
[01:38:09.246 --> 01:38:10.187]  We need your support.
[01:38:10.507 --> 01:38:12.067]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:38:28.513 --> 01:38:31.914]  Bodies, really, you should check out that product.
[01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:35.835]  I can't make claims here because of FDA regulations, of course, even though it's not my product.
[01:38:36.767 --> 01:38:53.200]  If you will try bodies for 30 days and simply pay attention to the changes in your body and the level of comfort and natural support of how you feel waking up in the morning, how you feel throughout the day, you will, believe me, you will notice a huge difference.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.282]  So check all that out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:56.682 --> 01:38:58.924]  Now along those lines, some good news here.
[01:39:00.071 --> 01:39:09.735]  You are born as an amazing, truly a multi-dimensional being in the sense that part of you is physical.
[01:39:09.795 --> 01:39:12.736]  You have a human body, a physical body with a physiology.
[01:39:13.196 --> 01:39:16.097]  You also have a non-physical spiritual mind.
[01:39:16.757 --> 01:39:18.278]  And this mind is not your brain.
[01:39:19.396 --> 01:39:20.897]  The brain is the interface with the mind.
[01:39:21.257 --> 01:39:25.959]  The mind is non-physical and it is not part of this physical dimension.
[01:39:25.979 --> 01:39:31.601]  So you are actually a being that combines both the non-physical, the spiritual, and the physical.
[01:39:32.222 --> 01:39:38.264]  But in order for that whole system to work correctly, you need the right nutrients.
[01:39:38.284 --> 01:39:38.964]  You really do.
[01:39:39.205 --> 01:39:40.045]  Your physical body
[01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:41.695]  We're good to go.
[01:40:02.532 --> 01:40:06.175]  You have nanotechnology inside your body right now.
[01:40:06.415 --> 01:40:07.216]  That's your immune system.
[01:40:07.516 --> 01:40:14.782]  It is the most advanced nanotech known to mankind and perhaps among the most advanced in the entire cosmos.
[01:40:15.203 --> 01:40:18.645]  That nanotechnology can seek out and destroy pathogens.
[01:40:19.026 --> 01:40:23.890]  It can seek out and destroy viruses and bacteria that don't belong in your blood.
[01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:25.471]  It can find them, identify them.
[01:40:25.791 --> 01:40:27.493]  It builds a database of what it's finding.
[01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:29.291]  And it stores that database.
[01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:35.274]  You actually have a stored database inside your body of every pathogen that you've ever encountered before in your blood.
[01:40:35.734 --> 01:40:38.856]  And this all happens automatically without you ever having to think about it.
[01:40:39.576 --> 01:40:49.281]  But if you don't have vitamin D, and you don't have zinc, and you don't have the right nutrients in your body, or even vitamin C, by the way, can really help your body fight pathogens.
[01:40:49.521 --> 01:40:56.285]  If you don't have these substances, the blueprint of perfect health that you have cannot be implemented.
[01:40:57.398 --> 01:40:59.039]  You have to activate your blueprint.
[01:40:59.399 --> 01:41:00.719]  Same thing about your brain.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.880]  Your brain is a supercomputer.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:09.943]  It is actually a holographic, neuro-computing system that interfaces with your non-physical mind.
[01:41:10.263 --> 01:41:15.525]  But that brain, being a physical organ, is nourished by what's in your blood.
[01:41:16.146 --> 01:41:19.627]  So what's in your blood determines the quality of the brain function that you get.
[01:41:20.339 --> 01:41:22.720]  If your blood is toxic, your brain is toxic.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.821]  Your thoughts are toxic.
[01:41:23.861 --> 01:41:25.062]  Your moods are toxic.
[01:41:25.582 --> 01:41:28.964]  If your blood is full of healthy substances, your brain is healthy.
[01:41:29.224 --> 01:41:30.084]  You're more creative.
[01:41:30.364 --> 01:41:31.445]  You're more upbeat.
[01:41:31.705 --> 01:41:32.906]  You're more intelligent.
[01:41:32.926 --> 01:41:34.527]  You can learn and adapt more quickly.
[01:41:35.107 --> 01:41:42.991]  So, what's in your blood matters so much about the quality of life that you get, the quality of the experience that you get,
[01:41:43.621 --> 01:41:49.823]  Your ability to think, your ability to reason is all, of course, heavily influenced by what's in your blood.
[01:41:49.863 --> 01:41:53.985]  This is why your blood, you can change the composition by changing what you eat.
[01:41:54.585 --> 01:42:00.787]  Avoid the toxins, avoid the GMOs, the glyphosate, the fluoride, the toxic chemicals, the prescription drugs.
[01:42:01.477 --> 01:42:13.424]  And start taking in nutrients from nutritional supplements, superfoods, foods that you grow yourself, grow your own garden greens, grow your own oregano, grow your own herbs and use them in your own food.
[01:42:14.345 --> 01:42:18.167]  Your world will absolutely be revolutionized by this.
[01:42:18.668 --> 01:42:20.889]  Change your blood and you change your world.
[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:23.391]  Change what you consume.
[01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:25.632]  Stop putting toxic products on your skin.
[01:42:26.092 --> 01:42:30.415]  Stop using toxic laundry detergent with all those fragrance chemicals that's coating all your clothing.
[01:42:31.147 --> 01:42:32.708]  Get rid of the toxins in your life.
[01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:37.172]  Bring in some detox and bring in some superfood nutrition.
[01:42:37.692 --> 01:42:45.499]  That will make a lasting difference and it will enable you to adapt and learn and handle the difficult times that are coming.
[01:42:46.039 --> 01:42:48.161]  You can't face the future without good nutrition.
[01:42:48.681 --> 01:42:49.522]  That is a certainty.
[01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:51.944]  Take advantage of good nutrition right now.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.883]  Fail yourself of this miracle that you already are.
[01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.165]  You just need to activate yourself.
[01:42:57.686 --> 01:42:58.467]  Much more straight ahead.
[01:42:58.487 --> 01:42:59.948]  Mike Adams, Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:00.089 --> 01:43:00.529]  Stay with us.
[01:43:04.214 --> 01:43:08.919]  This past weekend I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[01:43:10.222 --> 01:43:14.144]  And while I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald Living Section.
[01:43:15.585 --> 01:43:20.367]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe.
[01:43:20.387 --> 01:43:23.188]  But it's all packaged very, very slickly.
[01:43:24.049 --> 01:43:34.354]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23, 2018, Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[01:43:35.114 --> 01:43:41.418]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker ray on your television, right?
[01:43:41.979 --> 01:43:42.599]  I'm not kidding.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:49.043]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.206]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[01:43:53.626 --> 01:43:55.988]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[01:43:57.363 --> 01:43:59.025]  Man, I knew what I was gonna read before I read it.
[01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:05.253]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college and boys are depressed and boys can't get jobs and...
[01:44:06.556 --> 01:44:07.737]  You know what the problem is?
[01:44:07.977 --> 01:44:08.998]  Boys are boys.
[01:44:09.038 --> 01:44:13.401]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish, and how to be in dance class.
[01:44:14.282 --> 01:44:16.563]  That's right, we need to teach them how to be like girls.
[01:44:18.264 --> 01:44:23.668]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[01:44:23.908 --> 01:44:28.892]  He worries that the people they interview in here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[01:44:30.478 --> 01:44:33.500]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[01:44:34.621 --> 01:44:38.104]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[01:44:38.584 --> 01:44:42.887]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[01:44:42.907 --> 01:44:49.752]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[01:44:50.473 --> 01:44:56.397]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[01:44:58.683 --> 01:45:02.129]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:06.897]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[01:45:08.348 --> 01:45:09.109]  Along with little girls.
[01:45:10.029 --> 01:45:18.094]  And they would then set the women up as the intermediary between the Romans and the local slave colonies.
[01:45:18.654 --> 01:45:30.002]  You've all heard of this in the classic images of southern plantations and slavery where you'd have a large black woman who was in the house and the men were outside and she was the one that kept an eye out for master.
[01:45:30.762 --> 01:45:31.663]  She was the one that
[01:45:32.563 --> 01:45:34.646]  Made sure everybody stayed in line.
[01:45:34.987 --> 01:45:37.952]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[01:45:39.093 --> 01:45:42.739]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.982]  The whole human species is under attack.
[01:45:46.295 --> 01:45:53.199]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[01:45:53.999 --> 01:46:02.504]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[01:46:04.389 --> 01:46:09.452]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[01:46:10.413 --> 01:46:19.659]  We're three or four generations into this, and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms.
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.822]  And help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[01:46:24.682 --> 01:46:25.803]  That's how we're going to save them.
[01:46:26.703 --> 01:46:38.209]  Just like LBJ Bragg, 45 years ago, that he'd have black people voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.212]  And that's how they operate.
[01:46:40.873 --> 01:46:44.454]  The article is sickening, and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[01:46:44.995 --> 01:46:49.897]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[01:46:49.997 --> 01:46:53.218]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[01:46:53.538 --> 01:46:56.840]  They're the ones destroying your identity while claiming they're protecting it.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:01.262]  They're the ones telling you what to be while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[01:47:05.924 --> 01:47:08.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.179 --> 01:47:31.400]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.781]  Mike Adams here.
[01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:35.043]  We've got a huge report for you today.
[01:47:35.083 --> 01:47:37.805]  By the way, just a quick technical note to the crew.
[01:47:38.305 --> 01:47:51.694]  I'm not getting audio from you right now, but anyway, this report for this segment is going to be about the EMP threat, the attack on the national power grid, and specifically some very detailed
[01:47:53.664 --> 01:47:56.585]  Solutions, things that I've researched and will share with you here.
[01:47:57.505 --> 01:47:59.366]  None of these are things.
[01:47:59.386 --> 01:48:02.807]  I mean, I don't have any financial involvement in any of these things.
[01:48:03.568 --> 01:48:05.408]  I'm not being paid to mention any of these things.
[01:48:05.588 --> 01:48:08.689]  Some of them are just general, you know, general pieces of advice for you.
[01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:15.572]  But but first, let me cover the threat because there are two reports from the United States government that are relevant here.
[01:48:15.672 --> 01:48:21.834]  First, we have a report from the Electromagnetic Defense Task Force at Air Force University.
[01:48:22.611 --> 01:48:37.004]  And this is a relatively recent report which noted that the attack on the power infrastructure via EMP would be a threat to the United States, democracy, and the world order.
[01:48:37.784 --> 01:48:42.809]  And this threat talks about how it cites the Union of Concerned Scientists
[01:48:43.866 --> 01:48:57.593]  Their report, which states that 99 nuclear reactors could melt down in the United States of America because there would no longer be electricity to power the infrastructure that keeps those nuclear power plants cool.
[01:48:58.093 --> 01:49:04.296]  So imagine a hundred Fukushimas happening simultaneously across the United States.
[01:49:05.577 --> 01:49:11.280]  This, according to the report, would require the immediate evacuation of 4.1 million Americans.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.061]  Where would they evacuate to?
[01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:20.596]  No one really knows because where do you go when there are 100 nuclear power plants melting down in your country?
[01:49:21.757 --> 01:49:26.822]  Maybe that's why the report also estimates that up to 90% of the U.S.
[01:49:26.862 --> 01:49:31.327]  population along the East Coast could die within one year of the event.
[01:49:32.276 --> 01:49:37.900]  That's because the population density is so high, of course, along especially the Northeast.
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:43.884]  So, you know, Virginia, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and so on are the areas of the highest risk.
[01:49:43.964 --> 01:49:45.024]  Where do you evacuate to?
[01:49:45.805 --> 01:49:51.629]  You've got, you know, tens of millions of people in a combination of those cities.
[01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:52.209]  Where do you take them?
[01:49:53.343 --> 01:50:00.585]  Military commercial jets, the report warns, could fall out of the sky after becoming damaged by an EMP attack.
[01:50:01.025 --> 01:50:07.286]  The communications infrastructure would be gone, done, including military communications.
[01:50:07.707 --> 01:50:11.367]  And civil unrest, the report says, would begin after just a few hours.
[01:50:12.928 --> 01:50:21.950]  The report, this is really important, the report estimates it would take 18 months for elements of the power grid to be restored.
[01:50:22.977 --> 01:50:23.278]  18 months.
[01:50:23.638 --> 01:50:27.341]  And during that 18 months, it would be nationwide chaos.
[01:50:27.461 --> 01:50:37.689]  It would basically be, you know, total survival, Mad Max scenario, especially in areas like Los Angeles or maybe even Houston or Chicago, Detroit and so on.
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.571]  And that's just one of two reports.
[01:50:39.591 --> 01:50:44.455]  There's a second report called Surviving a Catastrophic Power Outage.
[01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:50.360]  And this report is from the President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council.
[01:50:51.033 --> 01:51:02.580]  And this report warns much the same thing, saying that existing resources are outmatched by an event of such severity, the EMP style attack.
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:08.603]  So this is a very real potential risk that we're all facing.
[01:51:09.284 --> 01:51:13.686]  What can you do to prepare for this beyond just the usual prepping?
[01:51:13.706 --> 01:51:19.610]  You know, the food supply, water filter, these kinds of things, obviously iodine in case of nuclear meltdowns and so on.
[01:51:20.858 --> 01:51:26.143]  I want to mention a few very important things today that maybe you haven't thought about.
[01:51:26.844 --> 01:51:29.326]  For example, what about your data?
[01:51:30.047 --> 01:51:35.632]  What about your records and the records of the infrastructure, the financial infrastructure?
[01:51:36.012 --> 01:51:37.093]  What about their records?
[01:51:37.733 --> 01:51:41.577]  All the data, your bank account exists as nothing but numbers.
[01:51:42.313 --> 01:51:50.438]  In a database somewhere, you know, you log into your bank account online and you see numbers and you tell yourself, ah, great, I've got that money.
[01:51:51.278 --> 01:51:52.139]  There it is there.
[01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:53.579]  But it's not there.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:54.820]  It's just numbers.
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:55.881]  It's not real.
[01:51:55.941 --> 01:51:56.861]  There's nothing there.
[01:51:56.881 --> 01:51:58.722]  It's just just an entry in a database.
[01:51:59.603 --> 01:52:01.924]  What happens if that database goes down and stays down?
[01:52:01.944 --> 01:52:04.105]  A couple of things you need to think about.
[01:52:04.866 --> 01:52:08.268]  Most data are stored on magnetic media.
[01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:11.930]  Magnetic media includes hard drives,
[01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:16.392]  Tape drives and external hard drives and thumb drives.
[01:52:17.032 --> 01:52:23.698]  These are all magnetic media and they're all, to some extent, susceptible to EMP attacks.
[01:52:24.559 --> 01:52:29.243]  What would happen in America if all Wall Street records were wiped out?
[01:52:29.904 --> 01:52:31.786]  All bank account records wiped out?
[01:52:32.286 --> 01:52:38.452]  Your local government, all its records wiped out because they're not doing backups on anything other than magnetic media, are they?
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:49.326]  What would happen just to your life if you lost all your electronic records, all your tax history or your spreadsheets, all the things that you've done, your business receipts that are electronic?
[01:52:49.686 --> 01:52:50.186]  What would happen?
[01:52:51.467 --> 01:52:58.431]  I dare say that this would cause massive, if this happens nationwide, this would be a collapse of the financial system.
[01:52:58.971 --> 01:53:02.093]  Because the financial system depends on record keeping in order to function.
[01:53:02.613 --> 01:53:07.076]  And yet, magnetic media are to some degree susceptible to EMP attacks.
[01:53:07.616 --> 01:53:08.537]  We don't know yet
[01:53:09.321 --> 01:53:19.009]  How strong of an EMP weapon it takes to damage the information on a hard drive, or damage a flash drive, or damage a magnetic tape.
[01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:20.691]  But it isn't much.
[01:53:20.711 --> 01:53:22.232]  It doesn't take much energy.
[01:53:22.592 --> 01:53:25.375]  Because over the years, hard drives have become smaller and smaller.
[01:53:26.474 --> 01:53:30.576]  The bit density on the hard drive media, the platters, the spinning platters.
[01:53:30.596 --> 01:53:32.577]  I mean, a lot of people don't know how hard drives work.
[01:53:32.837 --> 01:53:33.517]  They're not magic.
[01:53:33.757 --> 01:53:41.561]  They have spinning platters of magnetic media, and the little tiny bits there are flipped either, you know, positive or negative, 1 and 0.
[01:53:42.181 --> 01:53:42.741]  That's all it is.
[01:53:43.142 --> 01:53:46.423]  Those bits have become smaller and smaller over the last 20 years.
[01:53:46.463 --> 01:53:49.985]  That's why hard drives are a lot more affordable now and have much higher storage density.
[01:53:50.265 --> 01:53:52.126]  You can buy a 4 terabyte drive for $100.
[01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:56.248]  But it also makes them more susceptible to EMP attacks.
[01:53:56.768 --> 01:54:01.712]  Because the bits are now more fragile, it takes less electricity to alter them.
[01:54:02.833 --> 01:54:04.194]  Less electromagnetic potential.
[01:54:04.594 --> 01:54:10.219]  And that's why the hard drive heads that read and write are so small as well, because they're barely using any power.
[01:54:10.479 --> 01:54:15.963]  That's why you can plug a hard drive into a USB port, and you don't have to plug the drive into the wall into a regular outlet.
[01:54:16.283 --> 01:54:20.987]  It's using the 5 volts from the USB port to power everything.
[01:54:21.247 --> 01:54:23.609]  Spinning of the drives, the moving of the head, the reading and writing.
[01:54:24.414 --> 01:54:28.537]  Because it takes very little electricity to read and write bits on a hard drive.
[01:54:28.557 --> 01:54:32.260]  That means those hard drives are highly susceptible to an EMP wipeout.
[01:54:33.481 --> 01:54:40.307]  That's why I spent much of my Christmas holiday backing up data to optical drives.
[01:54:41.188 --> 01:54:42.649]  And this is one of my first recommendations.
[01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:47.913]  Optical drives will store your data for hundreds of years, maybe a thousand years.
[01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:51.316]  Certain types of optical media can last a thousand years.
[01:54:52.148 --> 01:54:54.951]  Optical burns bits into plastic.
[01:54:55.512 --> 01:55:01.699]  It's actually little pits, little burn marks, ones and zeros, effectively, on the media.
[01:55:02.259 --> 01:55:08.806]  Blu-ray, you can buy a Blu-ray drive for a hundred bucks, and you can write, I think, a hundred gigabytes onto one Blu-ray disc.
[01:55:09.427 --> 01:55:12.871]  Or you can buy like a Sony, Sony makes an optical
[01:55:13.937 --> 01:55:22.361]  A library where you can have up to currently I think 3.3 terabytes on one optical cartridge which is just a stack of blu-ray discs.
[01:55:23.022 --> 01:55:27.224]  So it's slow, it's slow to read, it's slow to write, but it lasts for hundreds of years.
[01:55:28.284 --> 01:55:29.265]  So if there's an EMP attack,
[01:55:30.163 --> 01:55:33.564]  If you don't have your data on optical, you might lose your data.
[01:55:33.744 --> 01:55:35.144]  In fact, you're very likely to lose your data.
[01:55:35.484 --> 01:55:37.785]  So start burning your data.
[01:55:37.845 --> 01:55:41.286]  Anything that you need needs to be put on optical starting now.
[01:55:41.686 --> 01:55:42.346]  Think about this.
[01:55:42.946 --> 01:55:47.227]  Also, hard drives lose about 1% of their bits every year just sitting in storage.
[01:55:47.667 --> 01:55:52.549]  A typical hard drive is useless after 10 years, even if it's just sitting there because it's losing data.
[01:55:52.569 --> 01:55:55.009]  A lot of people don't know that.
[01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:58.290]  That's why hard drives have to be refreshed if you have like a NAS RAID array.
[01:55:59.369 --> 01:56:00.190]  Alright, another thing.
[01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:03.713]  This comes down to rifles and ballistics.
[01:56:04.093 --> 01:56:05.615]  A lot of people have a ballistics calculator.
[01:56:05.635 --> 01:56:09.618]  If you're doing long-range shooting, you have to be able to calculate your ballistics.
[01:56:10.079 --> 01:56:11.760]  Otherwise, you will miss.
[01:56:12.381 --> 01:56:13.482]  You don't know your holds.
[01:56:13.902 --> 01:56:17.805]  You know, you gotta calculate, compensate for spin drift and gravity and all that.
[01:56:18.046 --> 01:56:19.287]  The ballistics coefficient of the bullet.
[01:56:19.647 --> 01:56:22.870]  So, a lot of people have their Android or iPhone devices and they have software.
[01:56:23.711 --> 01:56:26.333]  But there's a non-electric ballistics calculator you can get.
[01:56:26.988 --> 01:56:29.469]  It's called the Whiz Wheel, W-H-I-Z.
[01:56:29.969 --> 01:56:39.651]  Whiz Wheel is from a company called Accuracy First, and their website is accuracy1st.com, with the numeral 1.
[01:56:40.431 --> 01:56:45.273]  Again, this is an independent, I guess it's a plug for them, but it's independent.
[01:56:45.513 --> 01:56:46.313]  I own their products.
[01:56:47.037 --> 01:56:48.358]  They are like slide rules.
[01:56:48.398 --> 01:56:52.500]  They're like calculators for your bullets, your rifle, your ballistics.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.982]  And they work with no electricity.
[01:56:55.322 --> 01:56:57.283]  They don't need batteries and they don't fail.
[01:56:58.115 --> 01:57:06.024]  And you need to have one of these as a backup for every hunting rifle you have or every long-range, you know, target shooting rifle you have.
[01:57:06.264 --> 01:57:08.167]  The military uses these for backup.
[01:57:08.667 --> 01:57:15.295]  If you lose electricity and you are in a Mad Max scenario, how are you going to defend your ranch, your property, your community?
[01:57:15.815 --> 01:57:17.958]  You need to have a whiz wheel, frankly.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:21.003]  They work amazingly.
[01:57:21.023 --> 01:57:25.390]  I've been shooting a thousand yards with these just dialing in the compensation.
[01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:26.331]  They absolutely work.
[01:57:26.772 --> 01:57:28.916]  So those are just some things to look into.
[01:57:29.256 --> 01:57:33.884]  Optical drive storage, accuracy first, whiz wheels for your ballistics.
[01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:36.312]  Start thinking about things that are going to fail.
[01:57:36.352 --> 01:57:38.593]  Start thinking about how to preserve your data.
[01:57:39.113 --> 01:57:44.516]  Because if this EMP attack goes down, society is going to be chaos for 18 months at least.
[01:57:44.816 --> 01:57:47.678]  You need to find a way to survive, and this information can help you do it.
[01:57:47.838 --> 01:57:48.318]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.598 --> 01:57:49.419]  Much more straight ahead.
[01:57:53.323 --> 01:57:56.965]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[01:57:57.866 --> 01:58:03.149]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:03.749 --> 01:58:05.310]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[01:58:06.190 --> 01:58:11.874]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[01:58:12.854 --> 01:58:22.240]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:23.561]  It's that simple.
[01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:25.102]  So, it's epic.
[01:58:25.182 --> 01:58:25.802]  It's amazing.
[01:58:26.042 --> 01:58:27.543]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[01:58:28.124 --> 01:58:30.545]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[01:58:32.146 --> 01:58:33.288]  This is the stuff of legends.
[01:58:33.749 --> 01:58:37.255]  And I just want listeners to continue to understand something because it's the key.
[01:58:37.836 --> 01:58:40.161]  You are not just part of the info war.
[01:58:40.721 --> 01:58:41.383]  You're the core.
[01:58:41.423 --> 01:58:41.984]  You're the heart.
[01:58:42.084 --> 01:58:42.685]  You're everything.
[01:58:43.526 --> 01:58:44.588]  It's that realization.
[01:58:45.686 --> 01:59:00.151]  Understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own... whatever it is.
[01:59:00.771 --> 01:59:07.773]  Just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[01:59:07.833 --> 01:59:09.294]  And again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[01:59:09.374 --> 01:59:09.914]  I love you.
[01:59:11.094 --> 01:59:11.875]  I appreciate you.
[01:59:11.915 --> 01:59:13.936]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[01:59:14.616 --> 01:59:15.717]  I feel like you are me.
[01:59:15.897 --> 01:59:17.398]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[01:59:17.958 --> 01:59:23.742]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[01:59:24.182 --> 01:59:25.142]  What we're covering is
[01:59:26.323 --> 01:59:28.925]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[01:59:29.285 --> 01:59:31.306]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[01:59:31.686 --> 01:59:41.992]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and InfoWars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[01:59:42.313 --> 01:59:42.653]  Do it.
[01:59:43.273 --> 01:59:44.874]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[01:59:44.894 --> 01:59:49.657]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win, we're going to build an incredible world together.
[01:59:49.897 --> 01:59:51.278]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[01:59:56.847 --> 02:00:00.849]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:12.476 --> 02:00:13.356]  You found it.
[02:00:13.696 --> 02:00:15.217]  The tip of the spear.
[02:00:15.737 --> 02:00:20.300]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[02:00:24.788 --> 02:00:28.749]  As we begin the third hour here today on the Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams filling in.
[02:00:28.809 --> 02:00:33.010]  Thank you for joining us on December 27th, 2018.
[02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:39.591]  I want to remind you that I am not, I am not your entertainment.
[02:00:40.112 --> 02:00:41.732]  Alex Jones is not your entertainment.
[02:00:42.372 --> 02:00:50.534]  We are not here so that you can just listen to something that affirms your current beliefs, although that's great.
[02:00:51.392 --> 02:00:55.836]  That can help support, you know, your paradigm of the world.
[02:00:55.916 --> 02:00:57.398]  And we live in the real world.
[02:00:57.438 --> 02:00:58.959]  We live in the world of cause and effect.
[02:00:59.559 --> 02:01:00.821]  But that's not why we are here.
[02:01:01.701 --> 02:01:06.025]  We are here to give you information that can spur you to take action.
[02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:08.467]  Action is crucial.
[02:01:09.188 --> 02:01:12.211]  If you are listening to this show every day,
[02:01:12.853 --> 02:01:14.394]  And you're nodding your head in agreement.
[02:01:14.414 --> 02:01:16.056]  And you're going, yeah, that's right.
[02:01:16.096 --> 02:01:17.517]  That's exactly the way I feel.
[02:01:17.537 --> 02:01:18.858]  That's what I'm thinking, too.
[02:01:19.218 --> 02:01:20.459]  Yeah, the world's going crazy.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:21.901]  Look at this crazy stuff.
[02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:25.083]  They want migrants to come in and overthrow America.
[02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:31.088]  Look at the craziness with the Fed raising interest rates, trying to crash the stock market, and the liberals celebrating it.
[02:01:31.329 --> 02:01:32.249]  Look at the craziness.
[02:01:32.269 --> 02:01:38.815]  An 11-year-old boy dancing in a gay bar, like a trans... I don't know.
[02:01:39.095 --> 02:01:39.515]  It's too sick.
[02:01:39.535 --> 02:01:40.356]  I don't even want to talk about that.
[02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:45.553]  We're not just here to point out these crazy, insane things that are happening in the world.
[02:01:46.494 --> 02:01:52.158]  And you shouldn't be, if I could offer this suggestion, you shouldn't be listening to this show just to get agreement.
[02:01:52.799 --> 02:01:54.040]  You should be taking action.
[02:01:54.740 --> 02:02:00.425]  You need to do things right now, I believe, because times are changing so rapidly.
[02:02:00.905 --> 02:02:06.990]  There will come a day very soon where you won't be able to do things like get information online.
[02:02:07.551 --> 02:02:13.093]  You know, if that EMP attack comes that I talked about in the previous segment, you won't be able to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:02:13.674 --> 02:02:16.415]  You won't be able to hear this show on your mobile phone.
[02:02:16.895 --> 02:02:23.638]  You won't be able to go online and look up the firearms disassembly manual for your rifle.
[02:02:24.838 --> 02:02:26.919]  Because you'll have no connectivity.
[02:02:27.059 --> 02:02:31.441]  You won't be able to go to the grocery store and stock up on butter because all the butter will be gone.
[02:02:32.119 --> 02:02:33.480]  You won't be able to buy a water filter.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.423]  Amazon won't be able to deliver to your house.
[02:02:37.043 --> 02:02:38.925]  UPS won't be functioning.
[02:02:39.465 --> 02:02:41.847]  Heck, UPS barely functions on a good day.
[02:02:42.168 --> 02:02:44.690]  You know, none of the carriers will be able to deliver anything.
[02:02:45.611 --> 02:02:47.812]  Fuel will not be delivered to your local gas station.
[02:02:48.613 --> 02:02:56.840]  How are you going to function in that scenario if you are not prepared in advance, including the information side of this?
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.822]  So here's what you need to do.
[02:03:00.049 --> 02:03:05.791]  I think, it's just a suggestion, I think you should go through InfoWars.com.
[02:03:06.291 --> 02:03:14.533]  Maybe some InfoWars writers can do this, but put together like an index of the most practical, most important articles on InfoWars.com for 2018.
[02:03:15.033 --> 02:03:16.674]  Maybe I'll do this on Natural News as well.
[02:03:17.461 --> 02:03:20.183]  To say, download and print these articles.
[02:03:20.283 --> 02:03:22.885]  Here's a hundred articles you need to download and print.
[02:03:23.345 --> 02:03:26.807]  Well, just hit print from your browser, but you get my point.
[02:03:27.307 --> 02:03:30.449]  Because if things go bad, you won't be able to access those articles.
[02:03:30.930 --> 02:03:32.191]  No search engine will function.
[02:03:32.251 --> 02:03:33.772]  No social media will function.
[02:03:34.232 --> 02:03:35.853]  No mobile devices will function.
[02:03:35.933 --> 02:03:37.374]  Cell towers won't function, and so on.
[02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:45.393]  And if we have 100 nuclear power plants that go into meltdown at the same time, believe me, it's going to be such chaos nationwide.
[02:03:45.413 --> 02:03:47.894]  If you're anywhere near a city, it's going to become a death trap.
[02:03:48.735 --> 02:03:49.975]  You need to have a bug-out plan.
[02:03:50.336 --> 02:03:52.757]  You need to have a bug-out vehicle that can survive an EMP.
[02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:54.922]  You need to have a bug out bag.
[02:03:55.322 --> 02:04:00.946]  You need to have, you know, things that are EMP proof in there, like a compass, like that ballistics calculator I mentioned.
[02:04:01.246 --> 02:04:06.049]  You need to have things that can function even following these worst case scenarios.
[02:04:06.409 --> 02:04:15.975]  If you don't take action and get prepared with those things, I mean, get iodine, get vitamin C, cover your nutritional needs as well, get storable food.
[02:04:16.435 --> 02:04:18.697]  Get a water filter that's a hand-pumped water filter.
[02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:21.159]  You know, Katadyn is a good brand as well.
[02:04:21.179 --> 02:04:22.800]  And there are gravity filters out there.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.341]  Infowars Store's got some as well.
[02:04:25.182 --> 02:04:28.925]  Get this stuff now, and it will serve you for a lifetime.
[02:04:29.465 --> 02:04:31.907]  Because we're not here to serve as your entertainment.
[02:04:32.467 --> 02:04:35.790]  I don't take two hours out of my day to just entertain you.
[02:04:36.130 --> 02:04:38.172]  I'm here to help you save yourself.
[02:04:38.792 --> 02:04:39.753]  Because I know what's coming.
[02:04:40.413 --> 02:04:41.254]  Alex sees it.
[02:04:41.846 --> 02:04:42.546]  We know what's coming.
[02:04:42.566 --> 02:04:45.887]  We're always way ahead of the curve on this and we're warning you now.
[02:04:46.507 --> 02:04:56.530]  Get prepared because it's going to be political chaos, possibly civil war chaos, possibly international war in the years ahead.
[02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:59.150]  Be ready or you'll get caught with your pants down on this.
[02:04:59.751 --> 02:05:00.531]  Much more straight ahead.
[02:05:00.551 --> 02:05:01.031]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.857 --> 02:05:04.998]  Defeat the globalists.
[02:05:05.538 --> 02:05:06.699]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:07.259 --> 02:05:08.319]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[02:05:08.759 --> 02:05:09.860]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.062]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:15.702 --> 02:05:18.924]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:19.524 --> 02:05:27.568]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:28.508 --> 02:05:30.929]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[02:05:31.309 --> 02:05:37.870]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:42.451]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:05:42.511 --> 02:05:48.412]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:05:48.472 --> 02:05:51.293]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:05:51.493 --> 02:05:52.733]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:05:52.993 --> 02:05:56.034]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:05:58.591 --> 02:06:06.236]  Socialists have taken over the Democrat Party and they're pushing for a so-called Green New Deal.
[02:06:28.442 --> 02:06:33.844]  In Washington, D.C., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of those who's pushing for this.
[02:06:34.444 --> 02:06:50.849]  The Green New Deal, of course, modeled after the New Deal that was a massive expansion of government, created, I believe, the Social Security Administration that confiscates your wealth and then wastes it and will probably never pay off many people working today.
[02:06:51.490 --> 02:06:52.630]  The Green New Deal
[02:06:53.548 --> 02:07:02.471]  Is a promise to basically destroy the fossil fuel economy that is currently powering the United States.
[02:07:03.491 --> 02:07:05.352]  And let me say for the record.
[02:07:06.192 --> 02:07:07.512]  As you know, my name is Mike Adams.
[02:07:07.592 --> 02:07:10.173]  I'm here on the Alex Jones Show today for the record.
[02:07:10.693 --> 02:07:20.256]  I know that that I and and the the Infowars organization agree with this that this Green New Deal would be the end of America as we know it.
[02:07:20.316 --> 02:07:22.937]  It would turn America into Venezuela.
[02:07:23.757 --> 02:07:24.458]  And here's why.
[02:07:24.478 --> 02:07:35.988]  The fossil fuel economy is under Trump, by the way, fossil fuel economy has expanded to the point where we now are a net exporter of fuel.
[02:07:36.128 --> 02:07:40.973]  In essence, we are energy independent now for the first time in over a decade.
[02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:50.181]  Even as Obama tried to destroy fossil fuels and shut down coal fired power plants, President Trump has brought back oil exploration.
[02:07:51.187 --> 02:08:12.510]  And he's brought back clean coal in America, and he has enabled us to be more energy independent, which, by the way, is huge in terms of supporting our economic growth and insulating us from issues of geopolitics, issues in the Middle East, oil embargoes or oil supply restrictions or oil pricing from countries that are enemies of the United States.
[02:08:13.061 --> 02:08:16.462]  So Trump has, in effect, become America's best friend.
[02:08:16.903 --> 02:08:19.344]  That's why he's hated by the globalists, because they hate America.
[02:08:19.764 --> 02:08:21.044]  They hate energy independence.
[02:08:21.885 --> 02:08:33.049]  But this economy is only possible because of the amount of work that is condensed into, let's say, a gallon of gasoline or a gallon of diesel fuel.
[02:08:33.509 --> 02:08:37.891]  And I have news for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[02:08:39.358 --> 02:08:39.578]  Ms.
[02:08:39.738 --> 02:08:42.781]  Cortez, there are no tractors that run on batteries.
[02:08:43.461 --> 02:08:49.066]  Now, I understand that her IQ is too far gone to understand these complex concepts.
[02:08:49.727 --> 02:08:55.032]  But there are no tractors that grow food and harvest food and plant seeds that run on batteries.
[02:08:55.893 --> 02:08:58.375]  There are not commercial airliners that run on batteries.
[02:08:59.099 --> 02:09:00.879]  You can have all the green energy in the world.
[02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:05.361]  You can have all the solar panels and all the wind turbines, everything in the world.
[02:09:05.761 --> 02:09:19.124]  But if you don't have some kind of quantum leap revolution in battery storage, there's not energy density to power, like, long-haul trucks on the highways to deliver all the goods and services and deliver the fuel.
[02:09:19.924 --> 02:09:23.965]  And tractors and agricultural equipment, they don't run on batteries.
[02:09:24.205 --> 02:09:24.965]  They run on diesel.
[02:09:25.765 --> 02:09:26.706]  They run on petroleum.
[02:09:26.726 --> 02:09:27.826]  They run on fossil fuels.
[02:09:28.678 --> 02:09:35.862]  And it's astonishing to me that these socialist liberals in Washington, D.C., they are so incredibly brain dead.
[02:09:36.402 --> 02:09:36.802]  They are.
[02:09:37.542 --> 02:09:38.823]  And I don't mean this as an insult.
[02:09:38.903 --> 02:09:40.664]  I mean this as a medical diagnosis.
[02:09:40.684 --> 02:09:44.666]  When I say they are cognitively retarded, they are incapable.
[02:09:45.442 --> 02:10:01.502]  Of understanding the most basic principles of science and energy, and energy storage, and why diesel fuel powers the biggest machines, construction equipment, cranes, excavators, skid steers, dump trucks,
[02:10:02.143 --> 02:10:02.804]  We're good to go.
[02:10:22.367 --> 02:10:30.413]  is trying to destroy the fossil fuel system and get us over to so-called clean, green energy in some number of years.
[02:10:30.634 --> 02:10:32.535]  But it's a fairy tale.
[02:10:33.316 --> 02:10:44.925]  And by the way, by the way, in all of this, fossil fuels release carbon that's trapped under the ground, carbon that the plants of the world need to grow.
[02:10:45.757 --> 02:10:48.279]  Plants use carbon dioxide.
[02:10:48.479 --> 02:10:52.342]  It's the number one most important nutrient for all plant life on our planet.
[02:10:53.162 --> 02:10:54.363]  Food crops need carbon.
[02:10:55.144 --> 02:10:56.445]  Forests need carbon.
[02:10:57.646 --> 02:11:01.849]  Reforestation is only possible because of rising levels of carbon dioxide.
[02:11:02.169 --> 02:11:07.553]  The more carbon dioxide we have in the atmosphere, it's a blessing to the re-greening of the Earth.
[02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:17.200]  If we want to have a Green New Deal, it should be raising the carbon dioxide levels, because that would make the planet more green, more wet, more lush, we'd have more rainforests.
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.503]  The science on this is absolutely clear.
[02:11:19.903 --> 02:11:25.509]  Higher levels of CO2 are called a greenhouse effect, because a greenhouse is where you grow plants.
[02:11:26.350 --> 02:11:27.772]  CO2 is good for the planet.
[02:11:28.456 --> 02:11:35.320]  And actually burning fossil fuels releases carbon that's trapped underground that actually is a nutrient for plant life.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:38.782]  It allows third world countries to grow more food more easily.
[02:11:39.123 --> 02:11:43.725]  You have more efficient crop production and food, food, agricultural food production.
[02:11:43.985 --> 02:11:47.988]  You have more efficient of reforestation and ecological diversity.
[02:11:48.755 --> 02:12:00.221]  When you have all these rainforests of the world that produce natural medicines and molecules of interest to scientists for natural cures and medical research, that's only possible because of carbon dioxide.
[02:12:01.002 --> 02:12:05.664]  And it's fossil fuels that release the carbon dioxide that has been sequestered under the ground.
[02:12:06.064 --> 02:12:12.548]  So, in effect, this is absolutely true to say that burning fossil fuels provides nutrients for plants.
[02:12:13.768 --> 02:12:14.649]  It's absolutely true!
[02:12:15.562 --> 02:12:18.806]  You'd have to be completely ignorant of science to understand that.
[02:12:18.846 --> 02:12:21.590]  I mean, photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide.
[02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:27.177]  Photosynthesis is the metabolic energy of all plant life as we know it on this planet.
[02:12:27.717 --> 02:12:33.785]  Food crops, you know, rainforest, even marine ecosystems, the seagrass and the sea algae.
[02:12:34.733 --> 02:12:44.075]  And microorganisms in the ocean are all dependent on sunlight in order to engage in photosynthesis, and they produce oxygen.
[02:12:44.415 --> 02:12:47.976]  The plants produce oxygen as a byproduct, the oxygen that you and I breathe.
[02:12:48.236 --> 02:12:49.016]  So think about this.
[02:12:49.436 --> 02:12:50.676]  We burn fossil fuels.
[02:12:50.956 --> 02:12:55.157]  It releases CO2 into the atmosphere, which makes plants thrive.
[02:12:55.617 --> 02:12:58.978]  More plants can grow more food more quickly and release more oxygen.
[02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:03.199]  The oxygen raises the level of oxygen in the atmosphere to support human life.
[02:13:04.554 --> 02:13:07.316]  No wonder the globalists hate fossil fuels.
[02:13:07.356 --> 02:13:08.778]  They don't want to release the carbon.
[02:13:09.298 --> 02:13:10.699]  They want to keep it trapped underground.
[02:13:10.739 --> 02:13:12.160]  They don't want food crops to grow.
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:16.103]  They don't want independence in third world countries.
[02:13:16.184 --> 02:13:18.545]  They want countries to be trapped in poverty.
[02:13:19.186 --> 02:13:21.368]  They don't want higher levels of oxygen in the atmosphere.
[02:13:21.388 --> 02:13:23.449]  They don't want humans even to be able to breathe.
[02:13:23.770 --> 02:13:26.592]  This is why they're rolling out the global dimming experiments.
[02:13:26.992 --> 02:13:28.113]  To pollute the atmosphere.
[02:13:29.114 --> 02:13:30.495]  To shut down photosynthesis.
[02:13:30.995 --> 02:13:31.916]  This is why they're doing it.
[02:13:32.657 --> 02:13:33.858]  The Green New Deal
[02:13:34.847 --> 02:13:44.374]  If the socialists manage to push this, it will collapse plant life, it will collapse food production, it will lower oxygen in the atmosphere, it will destroy the U.S.
[02:13:44.394 --> 02:13:48.036]  economy, it will lead to mass starvation, disease, and destitution.
[02:13:48.416 --> 02:13:50.218]  Which is exactly what Democrats want.
[02:13:50.678 --> 02:13:53.580]  Because that's, those are the kind of countries they like to rule over.
[02:13:54.258 --> 02:13:55.218]  Look at North Korea.
[02:13:55.639 --> 02:13:56.499]  Look at Mexico.
[02:13:56.779 --> 02:13:57.459]  Look at Cuba.
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:01.421]  Left-wing, fascist, socialist, communist despots.
[02:14:01.921 --> 02:14:03.562]  What kind of countries do they like to rule over?
[02:14:03.622 --> 02:14:06.103]  Countries where you have impoverished masses.
[02:14:06.443 --> 02:14:13.126]  People who are disarmed and starving to death and have no money left because it's all been wiped out by inflation.
[02:14:13.606 --> 02:14:15.267]  Look at Venezuela today.
[02:14:15.867 --> 02:14:18.848]  Everybody turned in their guns many years ago and now they can't fight back.
[02:14:19.249 --> 02:14:20.709]  This is the Democrat plan.
[02:14:20.989 --> 02:14:22.490]  To thrust you into poverty.
[02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:33.895]  Throw you into starvation, cause mass disease and destitution and dependence on big government, all while expanding the size of government to an extent that we've never seen in human history.
[02:14:34.455 --> 02:14:41.979]  This Green New Deal from Ocasio-Cortez, this is the plan, this is the suicide pact for America.
[02:14:42.519 --> 02:14:46.541]  It would shut off fossil fuels, it would shut off the economic opportunities that those create,
[02:14:47.216 --> 02:14:51.601]  It would destroy farming, destroy agriculture, the food supply would collapse.
[02:14:52.181 --> 02:14:55.244]  It would destroy the economy as we know it today.
[02:14:56.225 --> 02:14:58.207]  No wonder Democrats love this plan.
[02:14:58.648 --> 02:15:00.590]  No wonder they are rooting for it.
[02:15:00.610 --> 02:15:02.131]  It would bankrupt the economy.
[02:15:02.792 --> 02:15:05.114]  And it would guarantee government jobs for everyone, by the way.
[02:15:05.295 --> 02:15:05.755]  Oh, really?
[02:15:05.775 --> 02:15:07.677]  That is just what we need.
[02:15:08.057 --> 02:15:09.859]  Half the country working for the government.
[02:15:09.919 --> 02:15:10.380]  Doing what?
[02:15:11.304 --> 02:15:17.009]  Oh, uh, fudging more climate change science studies that are rooted in total nonsense.
[02:15:17.469 --> 02:15:19.831]  I mean, what jobs would they even give people?
[02:15:20.732 --> 02:15:23.034]  Do we need bigger government in this country?
[02:15:23.614 --> 02:15:26.476]  Do we need to collapse the fuel economy?
[02:15:26.957 --> 02:15:31.741]  Do we need fossil fuels gone to the point where no one can run agriculture anymore?
[02:15:32.241 --> 02:15:33.182]  That's what Democrats want.
[02:15:34.235 --> 02:15:38.277]  It's just to give you an idea of how dangerous these socialists really are.
[02:15:38.737 --> 02:15:40.738]  Their ideas are the worst ideas in the world.
[02:15:41.138 --> 02:15:42.799]  They are the dumbest people in the world.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.581]  They are dangerous to this country, and they hate America.
[02:15:46.861 --> 02:15:50.903]  They want to overrun our borders, collapse everything that's working today.
[02:15:51.344 --> 02:15:55.506]  They are destroyers of worlds, and they want to destroy the United States of America next.
[02:15:56.246 --> 02:16:00.628]  InfoWars is one of the very few outlets telling the truth about this.
[02:16:00.648 --> 02:16:01.128]  Stay with us.
[02:16:01.429 --> 02:16:02.149]  Much more straight ahead.
[02:16:10.319 --> 02:16:22.832]  I don't know where these markets are going to go, but if the globalists have their way, they're going to go straight down, along with your job, and along with your pay increase, and along with everything you hold dear, because these globalists want to economically capture you, and bankrupt you, and control you.
[02:16:24.353 --> 02:16:32.982]  But if you use the free energy of word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, creativity, if you tell folks about InfoWars.com,
[02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:39.452]  Or NewsWars.com, or that local radio station that picks us up, or that local TV station that picks us up.
[02:16:39.572 --> 02:16:57.577]  If you spread the word about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show, if you go to InfoWars.com and look at the amazing products on every front that make your life better, that make your children's life better, that make your family's life better, then you're stepping out of their control and using your economic and cultural power to smash them.
[02:16:57.677 --> 02:16:59.558]  So I would encourage everyone, Christmas,
[02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:21.838]  Ordering is over, but right through to the new year, we have a store-wide clearance sale going, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, a free t-shirt with every order, 50 to 75% off many of these items we lose money on, but I believe you're going to experience how great our fluoride-free, super blue toothpaste is, fortified with little silver and iodine and other essential oils.
[02:17:22.058 --> 02:17:25.241]  I think you're going to experience how amazing it is, and you're going to want to reorder it.
[02:17:25.561 --> 02:17:35.908]  I think you're going to experience how amazing our colloidal silver bullet is, or how great Rainforest Plus our nootropic is, or how amazing our body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% cucuminoid.
[02:17:35.988 --> 02:17:37.069]  No one else even has that.
[02:17:37.169 --> 02:17:39.210]  The anti-inflammation powers are biblical.
[02:17:39.350 --> 02:17:43.553]  I believe in you, and I believe that you want freedom, and you want justice, and you want a future.
[02:17:43.693 --> 02:17:47.356]  And you understand that by financing InfoWars, you can't lose.
[02:17:47.716 --> 02:17:50.418]  Because you get products that are great for you and your family, you get a
[02:17:50.418 --> 02:17:50.758]  Absolutely.
[02:17:50.798 --> 02:17:51.239]  Absolutely.
[02:18:09.873 --> 02:18:13.475]  Because I'm the ultimate individualist, I'm the ultimate collectivist.
[02:18:13.976 --> 02:18:16.537]  The individual is powerful and is strong.
[02:18:16.957 --> 02:18:28.204]  When the individual chooses God and justice and joins the collective, it's a collective of individuals forming the true collective, not the false collective of the devil, Lucifer, whatever you want to call it that is slavery.
[02:18:28.484 --> 02:18:33.648]  Not a top-down collective, but a collective of common sense and the people that is transcendent.
[02:18:34.648 --> 02:18:39.533]  And it's in that true collective that humanity will reach the stars and go beyond.
[02:18:40.213 --> 02:18:50.743]  So as Christmas passes us, and 2018 goes into legend, into history, it's your chance to financially support the very tip of the spear of the fight against the globalists, and get great products at the same time.
[02:18:51.264 --> 02:18:54.046]  A true 360 win, unless you don't take advantage of it.
[02:18:54.327 --> 02:18:54.827]  Please stay with us.
[02:19:02.762 --> 02:19:07.145]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:19:08.246 --> 02:19:16.673]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:19:17.894 --> 02:19:25.920]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:33.963]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:19:34.723 --> 02:19:37.084]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:19:37.804 --> 02:19:38.665]  It really is amazing.
[02:19:39.285 --> 02:19:45.467]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:19:45.928 --> 02:19:48.589]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:19:49.810 --> 02:19:51.972]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:31.941]  You know, Trump signed the Farm Bill into law.
[02:20:31.961 --> 02:20:33.342]  It takes effect January 1st.
[02:20:34.342 --> 02:20:40.585]  And hemp, industrial hemp, has been legalized from a federal level all across America.
[02:20:40.625 --> 02:20:41.626]  This is a huge victory.
[02:20:41.666 --> 02:20:49.869]  This is the ending of the prohibition of growing cannabis in the form of low THC hemp.
[02:20:50.789 --> 02:20:52.070]  By the way, thanks for joining me.
[02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:55.633]  Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones on this third hour today.
[02:20:55.653 --> 02:21:01.597]  I'm going to give you some details about this hemp legalization move and why it is such a huge deal.
[02:21:02.137 --> 02:21:11.283]  But let me preface it by saying, first of all, I believe it is wrong for any government to claim that a natural plant like that is illegal in the first place.
[02:21:11.864 --> 02:21:14.686]  So as much as we celebrate the ending of prohibition,
[02:21:15.485 --> 02:21:20.347]  We should all be condemning the prohibition that has been in place for decades.
[02:21:21.927 --> 02:21:25.788]  How does a government have the right to criminalize a plant that grows like a weed?
[02:21:25.848 --> 02:21:30.009]  It literally is a weed in farms all across America.
[02:21:30.029 --> 02:21:30.850]  It grows on its own.
[02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:44.854]  And by the way, the nutrients, the molecules that it produces, the cannabinoids, are not only compatible with human physiology, they are molecules that your body creates itself to some extent.
[02:21:45.512 --> 02:21:58.222]  Did you know that if you eat omega-3 fatty acids, which are the healthy oils from fish oils or chia seeds or flax seeds and so on, your body actually generates a certain amount of cannabidiol itself.
[02:21:58.963 --> 02:22:05.928]  So your body makes this chemical, and yet the government has criminalized a plant that also makes it out in the wild.
[02:22:06.449 --> 02:22:07.750]  See, that's wrong to begin with.
[02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:15.096]  So, yeah, we celebrate the decriminalization or the ending of prohibition of this plant for agricultural use,
[02:22:16.101 --> 02:22:27.545]  But we have to remember, we are still suffering as food slaves under a tyrannical big government regime that never should have had that power in the first place.
[02:22:27.566 --> 02:22:28.946]  So always keep that in mind.
[02:22:29.306 --> 02:22:30.867]  The DEA is unconstitutional.
[02:22:31.187 --> 02:22:32.607]  The FDA is unconstitutional.
[02:22:33.288 --> 02:22:35.569]  All these government agencies are unconstitutional.
[02:22:35.609 --> 02:22:37.249]  They have way too much power.
[02:22:37.589 --> 02:22:39.570]  All the power needs to be stripped from them.
[02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:43.132]  How can they write their own law without it being approved by Congress?
[02:22:43.472 --> 02:22:44.152]  That's the problem.
[02:22:45.089 --> 02:22:46.510]  And that needs to be corrected, by the way.
[02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:50.534]  I mean, from ATF to the CDC, you know, you name it.
[02:22:50.814 --> 02:22:57.499]  These government regulatory agencies, EPA, you know, the Environmental Pollution Agency, they have way too much power.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:08.969]  But getting to the specifics of the hemp legalization farm bill law, it was pushed by Senator Mitch McConnell, which is interesting given that he's a senator of Kentucky, I believe.
[02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:13.693]  And Kentucky happens to be a place to grow a lot of cannabis, doesn't it?
[02:23:14.278 --> 02:23:22.501]  I mean, that whole region grew hemp for, you know, hundreds of years before it was outlawed, and it can grow it again.
[02:23:23.262 --> 02:23:25.943]  So he's also up for re-election in 2020.
[02:23:26.423 --> 02:23:38.108]  So he did this, I believe, as a political move to help get votes so that he can stay in the Senate and, you know, to get the people at home to vote for him because now they could grow industrial hemp.
[02:23:38.948 --> 02:23:41.529]  Here's what the law actually says, and here's what you need to know.
[02:23:43.194 --> 02:23:45.895]  You can't just grow hemp anywhere in the country.
[02:23:46.716 --> 02:23:49.617]  You have to still be licensed by the USDA now.
[02:23:50.177 --> 02:23:54.239]  So they've taken industrial hemp, which, by the way, let me back up.
[02:23:54.299 --> 02:23:55.740]  Industrial hemp is cannabis.
[02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:58.361]  It's just cannabis with a low THC level.
[02:23:58.701 --> 02:24:03.303]  The federal government defines that as less than 0.3% THC.
[02:24:03.663 --> 02:24:07.905]  So you can have high CBD, which is non-psychoactive, and low THC.
[02:24:08.723 --> 02:24:11.326]  That's defined as hemp, even though it's still cannabis.
[02:24:11.766 --> 02:24:15.030]  It's just a different variety of cannabis that has a different chemical composition.
[02:24:15.470 --> 02:24:17.452]  But you can't just go out and start growing it everywhere.
[02:24:17.953 --> 02:24:25.421]  The government still wants to license it, but the licensing has been moved away from the DEA, and it's now under the USDA.
[02:24:25.941 --> 02:24:29.044]  So it's an agricultural crop starting January 1st.
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:39.723]  Importantly, it also means that farmers can grow this industrial hemp, and they can get crop insurance because it's treated as a normal crop, just like growing soybeans or corn or wheat.
[02:24:40.903 --> 02:24:47.265]  And importantly, you don't have to spray hemp with glyphosate, by the way, so it will be glyphosate-free.
[02:24:47.865 --> 02:24:56.647]  Whatever you get out of that crop, hemp seeds, hemp oils, hemp extracts, hemp fiber, it will all be glyphosate-free because you don't spray it.
[02:24:57.287 --> 02:24:59.448]  You would kill it if you sprayed it with glyphosate.
[02:25:00.677 --> 02:25:11.984]  Also importantly, the FDA still asserts that it has the right to criminalize CBD that comes from this hemp, even if you grow it in a way that's licensed by the USDA.
[02:25:12.985 --> 02:25:15.166]  Now, I'm going to repeat that because this could be confusing.
[02:25:15.186 --> 02:25:18.228]  I know CBD is a very popular product, and it should be.
[02:25:18.428 --> 02:25:20.649]  CBD is, it's amazing.
[02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:28.694]  In the things that it helps your body do, CBD is, it's truly a miracle molecule if there ever was one.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:35.444]  It has so many uses throughout your body and people who take CBD supplements report extraordinary effects.
[02:25:36.865 --> 02:25:41.048]  The thing is, the FDA doesn't like that to exist, so the FDA has invoked a rule.
[02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:45.331]  And listen to this for a second because it's so insane you won't even believe this.
[02:25:45.871 --> 02:26:00.094]  The FDA says that CBD is illegal to sell as a supplement because there's a small pharmaceutical company somewhere that's studying CBD for possible approval as a prescription drug at some future date.
[02:26:00.974 --> 02:26:04.955]  And that, according to the FDA, makes CBD supplements illegal.
[02:26:05.575 --> 02:26:09.436]  Now, I almost got to say that again because you hear that and you're going, what?
[02:26:09.616 --> 02:26:11.036]  What are you talking about?
[02:26:11.076 --> 02:26:11.216]  Yeah.
[02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:26.084]  The FDA says that even if there's a natural molecule, if there's some drug company studying that molecule for a possible prescription drug in the future, that that molecule becomes illegal, even if it's existed throughout all of human history.
[02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:35.753]  In other words, by the same logic, the FDA could say, well, vitamin C is now illegal because there's some drug company that's studying vitamin C as a drug.
[02:26:36.727 --> 02:26:41.951]  You know, like an anti-cancer drug or something, because vitamin C does so many amazing things in your body as well.
[02:26:42.612 --> 02:26:43.772]  This is the FDA's logic.
[02:26:44.453 --> 02:26:46.274]  This has never been approved by Congress.
[02:26:47.035 --> 02:26:50.558]  This is not approved by the Trump administration, this insanity by the FDA.
[02:26:50.818 --> 02:27:04.869]  But the FDA is asserting this under its own rule, saying that it can block the sales of CBD supplements, that it can criminalize them, that it can attack and shut down companies that advertise CBD supplements.
[02:27:05.549 --> 02:27:06.350]  And that's why
[02:27:07.455 --> 02:27:13.178]  Companies that are selling CBD products are now switching to saying that they are hemp extracts.
[02:27:13.798 --> 02:27:15.279]  They don't advertise the CBD.
[02:27:15.319 --> 02:27:22.002]  They are naturally high levels of CBD and other cannabinoids.
[02:27:22.502 --> 02:27:24.743]  That's simply part of what the plant is.
[02:27:25.323 --> 02:27:32.706]  That's the language that you're seeing now in the supplements market to try to evade or avoid the FDA insanity.
[02:27:33.627 --> 02:27:36.108]  Now, hopefully, hopefully,
[02:27:37.205 --> 02:27:51.914]  This new Farm Bill law signed by Trump will allow more industrial hemp to be grown nationwide and it will become so popular that the FDA will have to back off of its position and eventually allow CBD supplements to be advertised as CBD supplements.
[02:27:52.635 --> 02:27:54.456]  This comes back to the big government issue.
[02:27:54.876 --> 02:27:56.417]  Why does the FDA have this power?
[02:27:57.277 --> 02:28:02.841]  Why can the FDA criminalize a molecule that your body makes and that is found out in the wild?
[02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:05.643]  Why does the FDA have this
[02:28:07.239 --> 02:28:19.809]  dictatorial power to destroy your life and your company just because you are using a molecule that frankly, you know, God blessed us with all across this planet.
[02:28:19.829 --> 02:28:24.853]  This molecule is it's like medicine from heaven and it's supposed to be free.
[02:28:24.893 --> 02:28:27.235]  It's supposed to grow everywhere everywhere like weeds.
[02:28:27.295 --> 02:28:29.237]  It's supposed to be so common.
[02:28:30.091 --> 02:28:34.976]  So commonplace that everybody can just go out in their backyard and have some natural medicine.
[02:28:35.376 --> 02:28:37.739]  That's what cannabis is supposed to be.
[02:28:38.259 --> 02:28:45.927]  But the government doesn't want you to be able to take advantage of that medicine because they want you to buy pharmaceuticals and chemotherapy.
[02:28:46.507 --> 02:28:54.115]  They want you to be licensed and controlled and silenced so that you don't tell the truth about natural medicine that grows everywhere across the country.
[02:28:54.918 --> 02:28:58.021]  There's the truth about cannabis that you won't hear from the left-wing media.
[02:28:58.581 --> 02:28:59.302]  Much more straight ahead.
[02:28:59.442 --> 02:29:01.043]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:01.063 --> 02:29:01.504]  Stay with us.
[02:29:02.504 --> 02:29:06.488]  You may need... We're ending the year.
[02:29:06.868 --> 02:29:07.829]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[02:29:07.909 --> 02:29:08.850]  It's been an insane year.
[02:29:10.131 --> 02:29:17.717]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming, and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[02:29:18.798 --> 02:29:21.941]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers,
[02:29:23.641 --> 02:29:29.724]  Understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for Infowars, not just for America, but for the world.
[02:29:30.764 --> 02:29:38.948]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[02:29:40.009 --> 02:29:44.371]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[02:29:44.391 --> 02:29:47.112]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[02:29:47.432 --> 02:29:49.293]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[02:29:51.061 --> 02:29:52.923]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[02:29:52.963 --> 02:29:55.405]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[02:29:56.185 --> 02:29:58.827]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[02:30:00.188 --> 02:30:03.171]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[02:30:03.331 --> 02:30:13.139]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe.
[02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:16.771]  And they weren't sure where to hit.
[02:30:16.991 --> 02:30:25.137]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit.
[02:30:25.798 --> 02:30:27.519]  Or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:34.585]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it, that they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[02:30:35.495 --> 02:30:42.701]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[02:30:42.721 --> 02:30:48.726]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[02:30:49.147 --> 02:30:52.670]  That's a separate battle.
[02:30:52.890 --> 02:31:00.216]  And so, they would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[02:31:00.716 --> 02:31:03.459]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[02:31:04.349 --> 02:31:09.730]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flack, comes from that.
[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:25.374]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flack is, and we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most, and lo and behold,
[02:31:27.177 --> 02:31:30.440]  That turns out to be the most accurate information.
[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:34.383]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[02:31:35.487 --> 02:31:44.295]  I want to point out, we've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[02:31:44.715 --> 02:31:57.727]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[02:31:57.927 --> 02:31:59.649]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[02:32:00.635 --> 02:32:08.938]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[02:32:09.618 --> 02:32:14.840]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:18.841]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[02:32:19.581 --> 02:32:26.924]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:29.565]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[02:32:30.305 --> 02:32:32.689]  Until the end of this year.
[02:32:33.550 --> 02:32:41.682]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[02:32:42.722 --> 02:32:45.364]  And of course, so many other great items.
[02:32:45.404 --> 02:32:51.189]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[02:32:51.229 --> 02:32:55.513]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[02:32:55.853 --> 02:32:56.894]  A true 360 win.
[02:32:57.295 --> 02:32:58.776]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:58.956 --> 02:33:00.637]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:33:06.442 --> 02:33:09.045]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.030 --> 02:33:28.290]  All right.
[02:33:28.310 --> 02:33:34.213]  One of the best New Year's gifts you can give yourself is to manufacture your own legal firearm at home.
[02:33:34.914 --> 02:33:38.075]  And that's one of the things that I did over the Christmas holiday.
[02:33:38.115 --> 02:33:43.698]  You can see here there's a there's a lower that is the reason it's it's shiny in the center.
[02:33:43.738 --> 02:33:48.481]  There might be slightly out of focus is because it was it was drilled out.
[02:33:48.501 --> 02:33:50.102]  It was I used a ghost gunner.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:55.143]  And I built this myself, and of course, it's perfectly legal to do so.
[02:33:55.944 --> 02:34:00.427]  My disclaimer for this entire segment is I always encourage you to follow the laws.
[02:34:00.928 --> 02:34:03.770]  Don't want you to do anything illegal or get yourself in trouble that way.
[02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:09.594]  But I live in Texas, and under federal law and Texas law, it is legal to manufacture your own firearms.
[02:34:10.234 --> 02:34:13.497]  And so I purchased a Ghost Gunner from Defense Distributed.
[02:34:14.771 --> 02:34:16.032]  And it works perfectly fine.
[02:34:16.292 --> 02:34:18.694]  You might even be wondering, like, how does it work on this?
[02:34:18.774 --> 02:34:21.176]  Because this isn't the bare aluminum.
[02:34:21.196 --> 02:34:33.706]  Well, turns out you can just kind of dremel away six contact areas on this lower, and that's where the router bit touches this for conductivity.
[02:34:34.127 --> 02:34:35.548]  And if you sort of dremel away
[02:34:36.405 --> 02:34:45.176]  The coding on those six areas, then it'll absolutely work even if you've got, you know, different kinds of coatings on it, such as Cerakote or whatever you're using.
[02:34:46.018 --> 02:34:48.521]  So this is this is the segment.
[02:34:48.541 --> 02:34:49.342]  This is what's important.
[02:34:50.683 --> 02:35:07.456]  We are entering a realm now where Democrats are trying to push these red flag gun laws where they say that anybody who is reported secretly to a judge can be raided and have their firearms confiscated without any due process, no rule of law, nothing.
[02:35:08.076 --> 02:35:09.397]  You have no right to defend yourself.
[02:35:10.298 --> 02:35:12.720]  You have no right to argue in your defense.
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:13.921]  You have no right to even
[02:35:15.183 --> 02:35:16.423]  Present evidence in your defense.
[02:35:16.784 --> 02:35:17.584]  You have no rights at all.
[02:35:17.664 --> 02:35:19.684]  This is a total violation of the Second Amendment.
[02:35:20.145 --> 02:35:28.467]  But just as importantly, what Democrats believe qualifies you for a red flag gun law is simply wanting to own a firearm.
[02:35:28.907 --> 02:35:34.989]  So according to the definition of the Democrats, wanting to own a firearm makes you crazy, or makes you dangerous.
[02:35:35.069 --> 02:35:36.890]  And that's enough to have your guns confiscated.
[02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:37.450]  You see the catch-22?
[02:35:37.470 --> 02:35:38.770]  It's a catch-22!
[02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:39.010]  It's like,
[02:35:41.212 --> 02:35:44.335]  If you want to own guns, you shouldn't be allowed to own guns.
[02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:47.317]  The only people that should be allowed to own guns are people who don't want guns.
[02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:49.859]  Because they're the only sane people, according to Democrats.
[02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:52.782]  It's kind of like the way they censor conservative speech.
[02:35:52.822 --> 02:35:59.627]  They say, well, all conservative speech is hate speech, and we have to make our communities safe places against hate speech.
[02:35:59.748 --> 02:36:02.230]  That's the Zuckerberg talk right there.
[02:36:02.430 --> 02:36:05.132]  Have to be safe spaces against hate speech.
[02:36:05.172 --> 02:36:06.073]  Well, what is hate speech?
[02:36:06.653 --> 02:36:08.575]  Well, hate speech is anything that we disagree with.
[02:36:09.341 --> 02:36:11.483]  Hate speech is anything that a conservative says.
[02:36:11.883 --> 02:36:14.184]  Hate speech is anything that a Trump supporter might utter.
[02:36:15.305 --> 02:36:18.468]  Hate speech is speech that says that people should make their own guns.
[02:36:19.108 --> 02:36:21.450]  That's hate speech, according to the left.
[02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:25.913]  But I'm here to tell you that manufacturing your own firearm is a great American tradition.
[02:36:26.573 --> 02:36:29.515]  And it is currently legal under most states.
[02:36:29.876 --> 02:36:38.802]  But I always encourage you to check your state laws because I believe in New Jersey, and perhaps elsewhere, it is now illegal to own a ghost gunner machine.
[02:36:39.591 --> 02:36:41.412]  Now, a ghost gunner is not a 3D printer.
[02:36:42.173 --> 02:36:43.193]  These are not 3D printed.
[02:36:43.253 --> 02:36:45.595]  These are milled out aluminum blocks.
[02:36:46.375 --> 02:36:50.277]  And a ghost gunner is a milling machine, a CNC milling machine.
[02:36:50.558 --> 02:36:51.598]  It removes material.
[02:36:51.999 --> 02:36:53.599]  For 3D printers, add material.
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:59.543]  And by the way, if you ever tried to 3D print an AR-15 lower and fire it, it would explode.
[02:37:00.364 --> 02:37:01.184]  In your face, probably.
[02:37:01.224 --> 02:37:05.106]  So don't try that because the materials aren't strong enough to handle that.
[02:37:05.727 --> 02:37:07.568]  So you mill it out with aluminum.
[02:37:08.405 --> 02:37:15.654]  And then you, of course, add the upper, you know, with the barrel and the bolt carrier group and the charging handle.
[02:37:15.714 --> 02:37:19.939]  And, you know, you finish the rifle, you know, the buffer spring, all that stuff.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.423]  And then you go out and test it, make sure it's working well.
[02:37:24.444 --> 02:37:27.528]  Now, a lot of people wonder, do you have to put a serial number on that firearm?
[02:37:28.530 --> 02:37:33.894]  Opinion varies, and I'm not a lawyer, so again, follow and research your local laws.
[02:37:34.315 --> 02:37:46.964]  But I've researched local laws in Texas and federal laws, and it is my opinion, after that research, that there is no current federal or state requirement in my area to put a serial number on a self-manufactured firearm.
[02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:55.991]  But if you sell it to somebody, or you give it to somebody, according to the law, yes, it has to be serialized at that time.
[02:37:56.692 --> 02:37:57.352]  Why does this matter?
[02:37:59.176 --> 02:38:09.324]  If you don't serialize a firearm, then if you manufacture more than one, it's hard for government confiscation tyrants to know how many you have.
[02:38:10.505 --> 02:38:19.511]  If you're making your own firearms, and you serialize them, and you have, you know, one through ten, and they find a gun that is number ten, they're gonna ask you, where are the other nine?
[02:38:20.552 --> 02:38:24.155]  So, I say, as long as it's legal, don't serialize them!
[02:38:25.001 --> 02:38:29.123]  Why put on your gun a quantity number of how many you own?
[02:38:29.223 --> 02:38:33.484]  Or, if you want to serialize it, make up some big long number.
[02:38:33.504 --> 02:38:33.484]  1,629,742.
[02:38:33.644 --> 02:38:37.546]  That's, there you go, that's the serial number.
[02:38:37.886 --> 02:38:38.686]  Let them deal with that.
[02:38:40.047 --> 02:38:44.008]  Let them ask, really, you have another 1 million guns that you made?
[02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:46.109]  Yeah, sure, in this closet.
[02:38:46.129 --> 02:38:46.670]  They're right there.
[02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:47.670]  All million of them.
[02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:52.832]  Because, you know, the gun confiscation tyrants are so stupid, they don't even know what numbers mean.
[02:38:53.786 --> 02:39:01.952]  But the point is, when gun confiscation kicks in, and believe me, the Democrats are going to push for it, they're going to have more shootings.
[02:39:02.852 --> 02:39:08.436]  Make no mistake, there are more shootings being planned right now for the purpose of calling for gun confiscation.
[02:39:08.697 --> 02:39:12.940]  Just like Operation Fast and Furious under Barack Obama and Eric Holder.
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:22.166]  That was a false flag operation to try to ban guns by letting guns get into the hands of violent drug dealers and Mexican drug cartels.
[02:39:22.466 --> 02:39:23.167]  That was the whole plan.
[02:39:23.968 --> 02:39:27.892]  And isn't it amazing that Eric Holder has never been charged for gun running?
[02:39:28.492 --> 02:39:30.234]  And that Barack Obama has never been charged for that.
[02:39:30.274 --> 02:39:31.415]  Anyway, that happened.
[02:39:31.495 --> 02:39:31.995]  That's true.
[02:39:32.956 --> 02:39:38.401]  But when they come to confiscate your guns, they're going to go by the records.
[02:39:39.182 --> 02:39:47.369]  So if you purchased a firearm and you went through the FBI background NICS system, the background check system, there is a federal record of your purchase.
[02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:50.232]  Those records will be used to confiscate your guns.
[02:39:51.334 --> 02:39:52.514]  This is what happened in Venezuela.
[02:39:52.534 --> 02:39:57.916]  The people were told by the government there, hey, there's too much crime and violence in society.
[02:39:57.956 --> 02:39:59.697]  We need to have a peaceful society.
[02:39:59.997 --> 02:40:01.017]  Everybody should give up their guns.
[02:40:01.258 --> 02:40:04.159]  And the Venezuelan people said, yeah, that sounds like an awesome idea.
[02:40:04.179 --> 02:40:05.299]  Let's give up our guns.
[02:40:06.159 --> 02:40:19.044]  So they gave up all their guns and the government, for those who didn't give them up, the government just went door to door based on the records they had and they took the guns and they confiscated hundreds of thousands of weapons and they arrested thousands of people.
[02:40:20.035 --> 02:40:24.818]  And then Venezuela had no guns in the hands of citizens, but all the guns in the hands of the government.
[02:40:26.299 --> 02:40:29.541]  Shortly after that, the government decided to declare war on the citizens.
[02:40:30.662 --> 02:40:32.503]  The government said, oh, we're going to steal all your money.
[02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:34.544]  We're going to hyperinflate the currency.
[02:40:34.564 --> 02:40:36.906]  We're going to make it a crime to criticize the government.
[02:40:36.946 --> 02:40:41.709]  We're going to arrest you and basically assassinate you if you criticize the regime.
[02:40:42.609 --> 02:40:44.911]  And you don't have any guns to defend yourself with.
[02:40:45.491 --> 02:40:48.273]  So the Venezuelan people are now starving to death.
[02:40:48.977 --> 02:40:52.859]  And the women are selling their bodies for, you know, meals.
[02:40:53.719 --> 02:40:54.759]  And people are desperate.
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:59.662]  People are eating zoo animals and their neighbors' pets, if any are even remaining at this point.
[02:40:59.682 --> 02:41:01.202]  They're dumpster diving for food.
[02:41:01.702 --> 02:41:07.625]  The government is a dictatorial, tyrannical regime, and the citizens have no way to defend themselves.
[02:41:07.965 --> 02:41:17.269]  Because they gave up their guns, they allowed the government to confiscate the guns, and the government was able to do that efficiently because they had the records of who owned the firearms.
[02:41:18.004 --> 02:41:32.071]  This is why you need to have, and I say this again with the disclaimer, always follow your local, but you need to have, in my opinion, at least one firearm that the government doesn't have a record of through.
[02:41:32.312 --> 02:41:37.955]  And again, you need to accomplish this through a legal means, such as, we're legal, manufacturing your own firearm.
[02:41:38.755 --> 02:41:40.176]  And it's absolutely important to do this.
[02:41:40.696 --> 02:41:42.377]  You can also have a concealed carry permit.
[02:41:43.217 --> 02:41:48.979]  In many states, you go purchase a firearm and it doesn't check with the FBI for that firearm.
[02:41:49.319 --> 02:41:52.680]  There's only a record on a piece of paper at your firearms dealer.
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:42:00.403]  And that is a relatively good situation compared to having a federal database of your firearms.
[02:42:01.523 --> 02:42:09.706]  So governments, even a government that today is, let's say, friendly to you, may not be friendly in the future.
[02:42:10.569 --> 02:42:17.691]  That government may be taken over by a dictator, a socialist, a fascist at some point in the future.
[02:42:18.252 --> 02:42:22.393]  And if that happens, your life may be threatened by that dictatorial regime.
[02:42:23.053 --> 02:42:28.575]  You and other Americans need to have the ability to defend yourself against tyranny.
[02:42:28.975 --> 02:42:31.476]  That is the entire point of the Second Amendment.
[02:42:32.122 --> 02:42:51.411]  That's why the Founding Fathers wrote that into the Bill of Rights, so that you could have that right, you could have that power, and if you're not exercising that power to manufacture your own firearms where legal, then you may be subjected to exactly the same kind of tyranny that is currently destroying Venezuela.
[02:42:52.211 --> 02:42:53.992]  Those are my thoughts on firearms.
[02:42:54.572 --> 02:42:55.033]  Stay with me.
[02:42:55.053 --> 02:42:57.834]  We'll be back after this break with much more.
[02:43:02.537 --> 02:43:15.387]  Tucker Carlson, the number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a patriot and a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones'd right now in front of all of us.
[02:43:15.987 --> 02:43:26.816]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:35.358]  It came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[02:43:36.019 --> 02:43:37.320]  He was right under me on the list.
[02:43:38.181 --> 02:43:44.028]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson, that's why.
[02:43:45.342 --> 02:43:46.803]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[02:43:47.443 --> 02:43:49.665]  I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[02:43:50.265 --> 02:43:53.247]  He was already, obviously, covering all that on air.
[02:43:54.107 --> 02:43:57.589]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[02:43:58.150 --> 02:44:01.952]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[02:44:03.462 --> 02:44:10.826]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[02:44:11.307 --> 02:44:18.231]  In the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[02:44:19.031 --> 02:44:24.795]  But today we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the US.
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:40.764]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[02:44:42.084 --> 02:44:43.665]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[02:44:44.425 --> 02:44:49.306]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes unaccompanied.
[02:44:49.326 --> 02:44:53.067]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[02:44:54.426 --> 02:45:01.014]  If we go back to 10 years ago, it seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about 8-9 million viewers a night.
[02:45:01.555 --> 02:45:03.557]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[02:45:03.918 --> 02:45:05.219]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[02:45:06.161 --> 02:45:07.042]  And what was he talking about?
[02:45:07.222 --> 02:45:11.567]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[02:45:11.607 --> 02:45:12.749]  He was going off their own documents.
[02:45:13.942 --> 02:45:18.707]  Lou Dobbs was taken off the air because he was number one because he was telling the truth and he was a patriot.
[02:45:18.887 --> 02:45:23.412]  Now he's relegated to Fox Business with maybe a million viewers.
[02:45:23.432 --> 02:45:25.994]  And Tucker Carlson is next and then Sean Hannity.
[02:45:26.435 --> 02:45:29.358]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[02:45:29.958 --> 02:45:35.919]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[02:45:36.459 --> 02:45:40.380]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:44.381]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[02:45:44.781 --> 02:45:47.262]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[02:45:47.862 --> 02:45:51.202]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[02:45:51.363 --> 02:45:58.124]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[02:45:58.737 --> 02:46:04.941]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[02:46:05.441 --> 02:46:11.225]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[02:46:11.285 --> 02:46:13.046]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas.
[02:46:13.326 --> 02:46:16.989]  Because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[02:46:18.277 --> 02:46:21.919]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:26.381]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous.
[02:46:26.421 --> 02:46:33.265]  Where San Francisco jury is letting an illegal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white, we have to reverse his signal.
[02:46:34.005 --> 02:46:35.046]  This is the real cancer.
[02:46:35.826 --> 02:46:44.872]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds at gay bars, have little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[02:46:45.233 --> 02:46:50.576]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[02:46:51.377 --> 02:46:53.899]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[02:46:54.379 --> 02:46:56.440]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:58.542]  Just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[02:47:06.306 --> 02:47:10.328]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.211 --> 02:47:24.814]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[02:47:28.199 --> 02:47:33.824]  It's my honor to be joining you today, and I really appreciate you tuning in.
[02:47:33.844 --> 02:47:36.846]  I hope you've received a lot of practical information.
[02:47:36.946 --> 02:47:43.070]  This is my last segment for today, and then we've got, I believe, Doug Hagman taking over the fourth hour.
[02:47:43.591 --> 02:47:49.075]  I always try to give you very practical information that's really, you know, well-researched.
[02:47:49.685 --> 02:47:59.532]  Information that can greatly enhance the quality of your life and make you more free, keep you more informed and aware, and help you get more prepared against what's coming.
[02:48:00.532 --> 02:48:05.576]  And I really want to invite you, let's take a big picture view together here.
[02:48:05.596 --> 02:48:17.044]  I want to invite you to start observing the events that are happening in the world around you, and looking at them now from the perspective of the war against humanity.
[02:48:17.904 --> 02:48:18.705]  Because I believe that
[02:48:19.742 --> 02:48:43.862]  As you start really having this overlay, this perspective on events that are unfolding, the narratives of CNN, the attacks on Trump, the mass poisoning of the food supply, the pushing of toxic chemotherapy treatments for people, I think you'll come to understand that these all have something in common, and that is the desire to exterminate humanity.
[02:48:45.323 --> 02:48:46.324]  That's really what it is.
[02:48:46.344 --> 02:48:46.885]  I mean, you think
[02:48:47.637 --> 02:48:54.983]  Look at every action, like Governor Jerry Brown recently just pardoning violent criminal felons.
[02:48:55.063 --> 02:49:02.089]  I mean, murderers in California are being pardoned now so that they won't be deported.
[02:49:02.549 --> 02:49:07.333]  Well, why is the governor of California pardoning violent murderers?
[02:49:08.054 --> 02:49:12.277]  Well, because it's all about spreading violence to attack good people.
[02:49:12.878 --> 02:49:15.480]  It's about committing violence against humanity.
[02:49:16.172 --> 02:49:29.360]  It's a small little piece of a much bigger puzzle that's all about how to destroy human lives, how to create disease and desperation among the population.
[02:49:30.081 --> 02:49:34.464]  And everything that you see, you start to have a question mark about it.
[02:49:34.724 --> 02:49:39.407]  A lot of times you'll see that it's a weapon, like cancer treatments are a weapon.
[02:49:39.547 --> 02:49:41.128]  Cancer treatments cause cancer.
[02:49:41.730 --> 02:49:49.534]  You know, the fluoride in the water supply is a weapon that's scientifically validated to lower IQs in children, adults, and senior citizens.
[02:49:50.334 --> 02:49:54.076]  Pesticides are a weapon system against humanity.
[02:49:54.196 --> 02:49:58.519]  Herbicides, cancer-causing chemicals, these are weapon systems against humanity.
[02:49:59.179 --> 02:50:03.961]  And even gun confiscation is a way to take away your ability to defend yourself.
[02:50:04.722 --> 02:50:08.844]  The illegal invasion of America through the borders
[02:50:09.602 --> 02:50:19.084]  This is a way to overthrow first world nations and destroy societies that are leading humanity into a brighter future.
[02:50:19.584 --> 02:50:21.425]  It's all attacks on humanity.
[02:50:22.565 --> 02:50:32.447]  And so, I have to say, this mass poisoning of the human race, it has been underway for a long time, many years, and it is accelerating now.
[02:50:32.927 --> 02:50:36.188]  And the only way to stop this is to stop the globalists.
[02:50:38.183 --> 02:50:39.223]  I have to emphasize this.
[02:50:39.483 --> 02:50:46.505]  If we don't successfully stop the globalists, then we are going to become extinct as a race.
[02:50:47.786 --> 02:50:52.387]  Our time on this planet is looking to be very limited.
[02:50:53.227 --> 02:51:00.989]  You and I may be witnesses to the last chapter of human history, at least structured in the way that we understand civilization today.
[02:51:02.009 --> 02:51:04.510]  Because the attacks on humanity are proceeding.
[02:51:05.325 --> 02:51:12.790]  And all of these screaming, babbling leftists who are attacking Trump and attacking America, what are they in favor of?
[02:51:13.290 --> 02:51:14.651]  They're in favor of abortion.
[02:51:14.671 --> 02:51:17.794]  They're in favor of pushing vaccines and maiming children.
[02:51:18.174 --> 02:51:21.736]  They're in favor of toxic GMO crops.
[02:51:21.896 --> 02:51:24.358]  They're in favor of polluting the atmosphere.
[02:51:24.658 --> 02:51:28.180]  They call it, what is it, stratospheric aerosol injections.
[02:51:28.801 --> 02:51:29.521]  It's terraforming.
[02:51:29.962 --> 02:51:31.383]  They want to block out the sun.
[02:51:31.783 --> 02:51:33.244]  They want to poison the planet.
[02:51:34.082 --> 02:51:35.482]  They want more air pollution.
[02:51:35.822 --> 02:51:37.003]  This is their goal.
[02:51:38.303 --> 02:51:40.923]  Everything that they do is about destroying society.
[02:51:41.303 --> 02:51:44.704]  It's about destroying human babies.
[02:51:44.804 --> 02:51:46.484]  It's about destroying fertility.
[02:51:46.524 --> 02:51:50.025]  It's about destroying the very definition of a man and a woman.
[02:51:50.885 --> 02:51:54.866]  It's about creating a society where there is no more.
[02:51:55.546 --> 02:51:56.426]  There are no families.
[02:51:56.446 --> 02:51:57.906]  There's no sexual reproduction.
[02:51:57.946 --> 02:52:01.927]  There are no there's no future for any children or the children of those children.
[02:52:02.367 --> 02:52:02.627]  That's
[02:52:04.201 --> 02:52:08.083]  If you start to look around the world and see it from that point of view, you will understand what's happening.
[02:52:08.763 --> 02:52:12.684]  And when CNN reports, oh, it's horrible that the troops love Trump.
[02:52:13.465 --> 02:52:13.725]  Why?
[02:52:13.985 --> 02:52:15.345]  Why is CNN doing that?
[02:52:16.286 --> 02:52:21.267]  Because it's an attack on the security of our nation.
[02:52:21.828 --> 02:52:25.509]  They don't want America to have a military that loves its president.
[02:52:25.589 --> 02:52:26.989]  They don't want America to have a border.
[02:52:27.009 --> 02:52:28.850]  They don't want America to exist at all.
[02:52:29.250 --> 02:52:31.131]  They are literally trying to destroy this country.
[02:52:31.866 --> 02:52:37.570]  And think about the incredible evil of the people that go along with this, the so-called journalists who are just fake journalists.
[02:52:38.211 --> 02:52:39.792]  Think about the propagandists.
[02:52:40.373 --> 02:52:48.579]  Think about, I mean, just think about the fact that as I'm here with you today for two hours, I haven't used a teleprompter for one second.
[02:52:48.599 --> 02:52:50.500]  You know, I've got some articles printed out.
[02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:51.441]  I've got a few notes here.
[02:52:51.821 --> 02:52:55.204]  But I've delivered this entire show without any teleprompters.
[02:52:55.993 --> 02:53:03.859]  There isn't a person in the left-wing media who could even do an hour show without a teleprompter because they're so brain-dead.
[02:53:04.559 --> 02:53:07.481]  They cannot even tell the difference between facts and fiction.
[02:53:07.941 --> 02:53:09.503]  They're no longer even journalists.
[02:53:10.003 --> 02:53:11.704]  They are just biological puppets.
[02:53:12.565 --> 02:53:17.468]  They're just talking heads, reading scripts, taking drugs, and pushing pharmaceuticals.
[02:53:17.808 --> 02:53:18.509]  That's all they do.
[02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:20.931]  They're barely human anymore.
[02:53:20.991 --> 02:53:22.432]  They are automatons.
[02:53:22.472 --> 02:53:23.713]  They're biological robots.
[02:53:24.893 --> 02:53:25.614]  They do what they're told.
[02:53:27.168 --> 02:53:29.750]  But that's not the future that you and I want for humanity.
[02:53:30.210 --> 02:53:32.733]  We are not here to just obey and do what we're told.
[02:53:33.994 --> 02:53:34.794]  We're here to innovate.
[02:53:35.575 --> 02:53:39.218]  We are here to help make humanity better than it is today.
[02:53:40.078 --> 02:53:55.611]  We are here to create a brighter future for our children, to keep humanity alive, to reach for the stars, and to expand our knowledge, understanding, and awareness of the world around us and how it works, because we are students of cause and effect.
[02:53:56.331 --> 02:53:57.632]  We are students of reality.
[02:53:58.592 --> 02:54:08.176]  And that makes us enemies of the delusion weavers who are trying to control and suppress human consciousness and human minds.
[02:54:08.897 --> 02:54:10.938]  And they can only do that through deception.
[02:54:11.478 --> 02:54:21.202]  They can only do that by distracting you from reality, by taking away your ability to think for yourself or to observe reality or to say that one plus one equals two.
[02:54:21.882 --> 02:54:22.983]  If you can reason,
[02:54:23.812 --> 02:54:27.293]  If you can engage in rationality, you are the enemy of the establishment.
[02:54:27.893 --> 02:54:31.373]  The establishment has no use for anyone who can think for themselves.
[02:54:31.873 --> 02:54:38.315]  And as I mentioned earlier, the most offensive thing in the world to a globalist is a healthy human baby being born alive.
[02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:40.115]  They can't stand that.
[02:54:40.695 --> 02:54:43.075]  They want all those babies murdered before they're born.
[02:54:43.436 --> 02:54:51.537]  But the next most offensive thing is a baby that grows up with healthy nutrition, good parenting, a family unit,
[02:54:52.994 --> 02:54:56.036]  Maybe homeschooling or a good school, a private school.
[02:54:56.736 --> 02:55:09.902]  Maybe some interaction with the Christian faith and some teaching of morality and ethics, combined with intelligence and discovery, where that child grows up and becomes a free-thinking adult.
[02:55:10.462 --> 02:55:12.523]  And that is a huge threat to the globalists.
[02:55:12.603 --> 02:55:17.386]  A free-thinking adult is the second most offensive thing to the globalists.
[02:55:19.086 --> 02:55:21.187]  And it takes courage to be a free-thinking adult.
[02:55:21.608 --> 02:55:22.348]  It takes courage.
[02:55:23.089 --> 02:55:28.810]  To share this video, to share this information, it takes courage to do what you do and to do what I do.
[02:55:30.391 --> 02:55:36.372]  But while most people want to be comfortable, you and I, we want to be effective.
[02:55:37.713 --> 02:55:39.733]  We want to help humanity move forward.
[02:55:39.873 --> 02:55:43.274]  We don't want humanity trapped and enslaved in this
[02:55:44.364 --> 02:55:53.251]  Mental cage, this prison system of disinfo and fairy tales and LGBT propaganda and indoctrination.
[02:55:53.591 --> 02:55:55.552]  That is a trap for humanity.
[02:55:55.592 --> 02:55:57.073]  That's mental slavery.
[02:55:57.514 --> 02:55:58.334]  We don't settle for that.
[02:55:59.355 --> 02:56:01.096]  That's why we do what we do.
[02:56:01.156 --> 02:56:03.398]  That's why you are listening to the show.
[02:56:03.438 --> 02:56:04.819]  That's why I'm here.
[02:56:05.882 --> 02:56:07.523]  Substitute hosting this show.
[02:56:08.063 --> 02:56:09.303]  That's why InfoWars exists.
[02:56:09.323 --> 02:56:10.964]  That's why Natural News exists.
[02:56:11.464 --> 02:56:15.965]  We are the real independent media and the independent thinkers of society.
[02:56:16.785 --> 02:56:23.928]  And everyone that you listen to here on InfoWars coming up, you know, Doug Hagman and Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Schroer and David Knight and many, many others.
[02:56:24.688 --> 02:56:31.290]  We're all independent thinkers, just like you, which is why we don't have the same talking points.
[02:56:31.890 --> 02:56:34.971]  You know, like Pelosi and Schumer, they tweet out the exact same tweet.
[02:56:35.589 --> 02:56:36.650]  Because they're handed it.
[02:56:36.730 --> 02:56:37.750]  It's a memo for them.
[02:56:37.930 --> 02:56:39.051]  It's copy and paste.
[02:56:39.611 --> 02:56:41.352]  They are globalist robots.
[02:56:42.153 --> 02:56:43.173]  We are nobody's robots.
[02:56:44.174 --> 02:56:47.156]  We are free-thinking human beings who love humanity.
[02:56:47.496 --> 02:56:48.356]  We love our world.
[02:56:48.776 --> 02:56:52.218]  We love healthy brains and healthy babies.
[02:56:52.579 --> 02:56:54.640]  And we love good nutrition, healthy food.
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:56.741]  We love having a bright future.
[02:56:57.261 --> 02:57:03.825]  And that's what we're striving to create by defeating the globalists that are working to systematically destroy humanity.
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:05.780]  That's why we need your help.

[02:57:16.362 --> 02:57:17.223]  Spread this information.
[02:57:17.283 --> 02:57:17.883]  We have a chance.
[02:57:18.323 --> 02:57:19.903]  We have a chance to defeat the globalists.
[02:57:20.283 --> 02:57:26.004]  We have a chance to save humanity from the extinction that is being systematically carried out right now.
[02:57:27.045 --> 02:57:28.605]  It's always my honor to join you.
[02:57:29.514 --> 02:57:39.144]  I will continue to do so as long as we have an opportunity to bring you this message of truth and courage, and frankly, divine inspiration, because that's what's behind us.
[02:57:39.164 --> 02:57:44.490]  We're fighting for God, we're fighting for love of humanity, we're fighting for the survival of humanity.
[02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:45.631]  Thank you for listening.
[02:57:45.831 --> 02:57:49.195]  Mike Adams for InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:49.575 --> 02:57:49.976]  Stay with us.
[02:57:50.016 --> 02:57:51.878]  We'll be back with The Fourth Hour.
[02:57:53.226 --> 02:57:56.870]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[02:57:57.771 --> 02:58:03.077]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:03.658 --> 02:58:05.220]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[02:58:06.121 --> 02:58:11.787]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[02:58:12.748 --> 02:58:22.135]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[02:58:22.916 --> 02:58:23.457]  It's that simple.
[02:58:24.097 --> 02:58:25.018]  So, it's epic.
[02:58:25.098 --> 02:58:25.718]  It's amazing.
[02:58:25.958 --> 02:58:27.460]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:30.462]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[02:58:32.063 --> 02:58:37.125]  This is the stuff of legends, and I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[02:58:37.745 --> 02:58:40.066]  You are not just part of the info war.
[02:58:40.626 --> 02:58:41.266]  You're the core.
[02:58:41.306 --> 02:58:41.867]  You're the heart.
[02:58:41.967 --> 02:58:42.587]  You're everything.
[02:58:43.367 --> 02:58:56.552]  And it's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own...
[02:58:59.371 --> 02:59:07.653]  Whatever it is, just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[02:59:07.733 --> 02:59:09.194]  And again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[02:59:09.254 --> 02:59:09.874]  I love you.
[02:59:10.994 --> 02:59:11.794]  I appreciate you.
[02:59:11.814 --> 02:59:13.835]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[02:59:13.855 --> 02:59:15.635]  I feel like you are me.
[02:59:15.795 --> 02:59:17.316]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[02:59:17.856 --> 02:59:23.637]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[02:59:24.097 --> 02:59:25.038]  What we're covering is
[02:59:26.238 --> 02:59:28.819]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[02:59:29.199 --> 02:59:31.080]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:41.904]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and InfoWars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[02:59:42.224 --> 02:59:42.544]  Do it.
[02:59:43.184 --> 02:59:44.785]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[02:59:44.805 --> 02:59:49.566]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win, we're going to build an incredible world together.
[02:59:49.786 --> 02:59:51.187]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[02:59:55.071 --> 03:00:01.016]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.386 --> 03:00:17.330]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.891 --> 03:00:21.253]  And now, your host, Doug Hagman.
[03:00:24.804 --> 03:00:28.467]  This is Doug Hagman sitting in for AlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[03:00:28.887 --> 03:00:34.071]  I'm so proud to be sitting in right after the fabulous Mike Adams, of course.
[03:00:34.632 --> 03:00:36.253]  With me is my son, Joe Hagman.
[03:00:36.293 --> 03:00:39.035]  Together, we run something called the Hagman Report.
[03:00:39.515 --> 03:00:40.516]  HagmanReport.com.
[03:00:40.636 --> 03:00:42.758]  That's HagmanReport.com.
[03:00:43.138 --> 03:00:44.980]  I gotta apologize, folks.
[03:00:46.421 --> 03:00:51.585]  I had some oral surgery done, and if I sound a little bit funny,
[03:00:52.426 --> 03:00:56.554]  It's because of the holes and stitches and all kinds of stuff in my mouth.
[03:00:56.594 --> 03:00:58.698]  So, but we'll get through this together.
[03:00:58.718 --> 03:01:00.101]  And I want to thank you for tuning in.
[03:01:00.561 --> 03:01:02.806]  And I want to thank you for the support all year of
[03:01:03.906 --> 03:01:10.569]  Infowars.com supporting Alex Jones, supporting the movement, which is extremely important to do.
[03:01:11.149 --> 03:01:13.170]  We are in the fight of our lives, I gotta tell you that.
[03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:17.652]  Of course, this year, 2018, we saw massive amounts of censorship.
[03:01:18.212 --> 03:01:31.057]  We've seen the tyranny, the tyrannical, oppressive nature of the Democratic Socialist Left against the conservatives, against the truth-tellers.
[03:01:31.757 --> 03:01:36.200]  We've seen so much take place over the course of the last 12 months.
[03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:40.082]  It's really 12 years worth of headlines over the last 12 months.
[03:01:40.722 --> 03:01:43.864]  One thing I want to touch on before we get too far into things.
[03:01:45.784 --> 03:01:47.365]  You want to talk about fake news.
[03:01:47.585 --> 03:01:59.168]  We had seen, and I want to bring this up, because one of the issues is about the Iraq war, or the Iraq, the presence in Iraq, the presence in Afghanistan, the trip by President Trump to Iraq.
[03:01:59.468 --> 03:02:02.269]  The leftists, socialist leftists, especially on Twitter,
[03:02:03.283 --> 03:02:17.313]  Just having this massive meltdown saying that essentially saying that they shamed Twitter shamed President Donald Trump into traveling to overseas to a war zone to visit the troops.
[03:02:18.094 --> 03:02:19.074]  Have you heard this folks?
[03:02:19.114 --> 03:02:19.755]  Have you heard this?
[03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:22.417]  It was because of the tweets.
[03:02:22.437 --> 03:02:26.640]  It was because of the shaming that was done, right?
[03:02:27.446 --> 03:02:45.155]  Well, obviously, obviously, folks, any thinking, rational, sensible human being, and Dan Bongino pointed this out earlier, would know that the presidential excursions like this have to be planned months in advance, months in advance.
[03:02:45.836 --> 03:02:54.320]  The support teams or the advanced teams that go out to carry the presidential security detail.
[03:02:55.149 --> 03:03:04.571]  So this was not, gee, I shamed him, he's leaving, he's suddenly going to go overseas now, because we've successfully shamed him into going overseas.
[03:03:05.211 --> 03:03:07.632]  So what a load of crap that's taking place.
[03:03:08.412 --> 03:03:19.655]  So I want to call out these morons out there in the news, and I mean, you've got to be a moron to believe that you actually had the power into shaming the President of the United States.
[03:03:19.695 --> 03:03:24.236]  To go out and to believe, even more moronic, is to believe
[03:03:25.245 --> 03:03:26.166]  What is being said?
[03:03:26.866 --> 03:03:33.251]  So with that, again, look at the facts and look at the fake news.
[03:03:34.031 --> 03:03:39.655]  This, of course, it might seem obvious to you if you're tuning into this fourth hour into the InfoWars.
[03:03:40.382 --> 03:03:43.545]  Might seem obvious to you that, hey, this does make sense.
[03:03:44.185 --> 03:03:50.490]  But media, the Hollywood crowd, the activists on Twitter, they claim that they're shaming them.
[03:03:50.510 --> 03:03:54.514]  Well, these presidential trips, as I said, are planned a long time in advance.
[03:03:55.254 --> 03:04:02.140]  And any rational, sensible human being with firing synapses should know this.
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:03.161]  Joe, I'm going to bring you on.
[03:04:03.561 --> 03:04:05.823]  I know that we have to talk about other aspects.
[03:04:06.903 --> 03:04:15.347]  I want to say it's good to hear you talking halfway normal again, folks.
[03:04:15.407 --> 03:04:21.350]  As he said, he had oral surgery done, and over the holidays and before the holidays, we really couldn't talk.
[03:04:21.370 --> 03:04:24.912]  He couldn't talk, so he had a lot of gesturing and whatnot.
[03:04:24.932 --> 03:04:31.515]  So this is the first actual day that I've had a chance to speak with him since that surgery, so it's good to see you back up and running.
[03:04:31.975 --> 03:04:34.377]  Yeah, but there's a whole lot going on.
[03:04:34.417 --> 03:04:36.859]  Definitely want to get into what is going on with Iraq.
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.223]  The people are taking issue with an unannounced visit by the President.
[03:04:41.243 --> 03:04:44.586]  You know, stating that they never reached out.
[03:04:44.626 --> 03:04:45.807]  He never reached out to them.
[03:04:46.548 --> 03:04:47.368]  But we're going to talk about that.
[03:04:47.388 --> 03:04:48.229]  And we've got some other stuff.
[03:04:48.509 --> 03:04:48.910]  Fake news.
[03:04:48.930 --> 03:04:50.011]  We've got some stuff on Christmas.
[03:04:50.071 --> 03:04:50.911]  The war on Christmas.
[03:04:51.252 --> 03:04:53.153]  And also on the Robert Mueller investigation.
[03:04:54.134 --> 03:04:54.334]  Yep.
[03:04:54.795 --> 03:04:55.856]  And this is InfoWars.
[03:04:55.876 --> 03:04:56.516]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:56.796 --> 03:04:57.237]  Stay with us.
[03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:04.822]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:05:05.342 --> 03:05:06.503]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:07.064 --> 03:05:08.125]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:05:08.585 --> 03:05:09.686]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:10.627 --> 03:05:14.871]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:15.511 --> 03:05:18.734]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:19.335 --> 03:05:27.382]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.323 --> 03:05:37.687]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:05:38.367 --> 03:05:42.269]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:05:42.329 --> 03:05:48.232]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:05:48.272 --> 03:05:51.093]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:05:51.313 --> 03:05:52.554]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:52.814 --> 03:05:55.855]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:05:58.083 --> 03:06:02.645]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[03:06:15.631 --> 03:06:24.375]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Doug Eggman.
[03:06:28.437 --> 03:06:54.104]  And welcome back to this fourth hour of InfoWars on this Thursday December 27th 2018 winding down this year and what a year it has been going by so fast almost into 2019 but we got some some great stuff to get into this hour we were talking before the break on about Christmas and President Trump and the fake news that we see and there's the insanity that the media and the Hollywood types have been
[03:06:54.524 --> 03:06:54.804]  We're good.
[03:07:10.509 --> 03:07:16.312]  From Breitbart, leftists recoil in horror after Trump signs military MAGA hats.
[03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:28.577]  This article explains how the media and Hollywood have predictably reacted in horror after the president signed several Make America Great Again hats and gave them to members of the military.
[03:07:28.997 --> 03:07:35.579]  Now, you have actresses, you have CNN personalities saying that this is just awful.
[03:07:36.060 --> 03:07:36.640]  Mia Farrow,
[03:07:37.469 --> 03:07:39.110]  On Twitter, this is awful.
[03:07:39.350 --> 03:07:43.812]  Trump signing MAGA hats for the troops who are stationed overseas.
[03:07:44.612 --> 03:07:53.716]  CNN analyst and former member of the Obama administration, John Kirby, warning the troops having a Trump campaign hat could be breaking military guidelines.
[03:07:54.236 --> 03:07:58.539]  And this is just all part of their war on Christmas and the war on Trump.
[03:07:58.559 --> 03:08:00.521]  We talk about the political divide in this country.
[03:08:00.581 --> 03:08:04.624]  Never before in my lifetime have I ever seen the divide so great.
[03:08:04.664 --> 03:08:07.246]  And it's not just a divide along party lines.
[03:08:08.007 --> 03:08:10.609]  If that were the... I mean, that would make it a lot different.
[03:08:10.629 --> 03:08:21.477]  This is a divide along President Trump and the Constitution and American way of life traditionally versus where they want to take it with this progressive social communist agenda.
[03:08:22.137 --> 03:08:32.640]  And we see that the left, we see the media, we see Hollywood, we see all these establishment powers that have come against Trump, that have come against America, that have come against Americans.
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:36.481]  We have to understand it's not just the president that they hate.
[03:08:36.861 --> 03:08:39.302]  The president is where their anger is focused.
[03:08:39.342 --> 03:08:41.623]  It is the people who support the president.
[03:08:41.643 --> 03:08:48.605]  It is the people who believe in his agenda, in the ideology of America as it was founded, and its intentions that they hate.
[03:08:49.045 --> 03:08:54.250]  And this is not going to go away when the President leaves office, whether in 2020 or 2024.
[03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:57.252]  And that's the battle that we need to be focused on and prepared for.
[03:08:57.673 --> 03:09:04.759]  Because as Hillary Clinton said just a few months ago, civility will not be restored until their political party is in power.
[03:09:05.159 --> 03:09:06.540]  And she only went halfway.
[03:09:06.620 --> 03:09:15.548]  What she didn't say was that civility will be restored when they're back in power and their opposition is no longer a threat or a bother to them.
[03:09:16.028 --> 03:09:17.369]  And that's the war we are fighting.
[03:09:17.769 --> 03:09:19.209]  And they do it in every which way.
[03:09:19.249 --> 03:09:20.810]  We talked about it here even on this show.
[03:09:21.230 --> 03:09:27.613]  When David Brock and Media Matters, that strategy came out against the social media strategy to destroy President Trump.
[03:09:28.033 --> 03:09:29.894]  Not sure of the exact title of that.
[03:09:30.634 --> 03:09:33.375]  But it laid out the agenda of how they were going to go after the President.
[03:09:33.715 --> 03:09:35.996]  How they were going to go after his administration.
[03:09:36.056 --> 03:09:40.838]  How they were going to attack him through social media, through the news, through the Hollywood, through the legal system.
[03:09:41.358 --> 03:09:43.159]  And we see it every single day.
[03:09:43.559 --> 03:09:44.920]  And it is... it doesn't...
[03:09:46.721 --> 03:09:47.482]  It's no stopping.
[03:09:47.922 --> 03:09:52.086]  I compare it to Groundhog Day or a baby that doesn't get what they want.
[03:09:52.106 --> 03:09:53.447]  They just whine and whine and whine.
[03:09:53.667 --> 03:09:55.629]  But babies usually get tired and fall asleep.
[03:09:56.209 --> 03:09:59.071]  These people, this evil, only increases.
[03:09:59.111 --> 03:10:02.094]  And the more we give it a foothold, the more it will take over.
[03:10:02.474 --> 03:10:05.397]  And we have to fight on those front lines each and every day against it.
[03:10:05.837 --> 03:10:09.978]  And however that looks for you, each and every individual person is what we have to do.
[03:10:09.998 --> 03:10:11.459]  And we cannot cease.
[03:10:11.579 --> 03:10:16.040]  Just like the evil will never cease, we cannot stop fighting.
[03:10:16.100 --> 03:10:19.402]  Because the moment we do, we are giving over to that evil.
[03:10:19.842 --> 03:10:21.262]  And you know, it's everywhere in the headlines.
[03:10:21.282 --> 03:10:24.503]  I gotta tell you, Joe, you are so exactly right.
[03:10:24.623 --> 03:10:26.364]  And let's always remember,
[03:10:27.174 --> 03:10:35.539]  The stopgap between the fight by the globalists, the globalists fighting the American people, the stopgap is President Trump.
[03:10:35.579 --> 03:10:37.600]  Of course, he's not part of the establishment.
[03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.682]  He's not part of the political process.
[03:10:41.122 --> 03:10:43.203]  And it's funny you mentioned, too, the Iraq thing.
[03:10:44.364 --> 03:10:50.127]  The number of people invoking the Hatch Act, that's nothing more than a petty
[03:10:51.199 --> 03:10:59.604]  So petty, because obviously when Obama visited the troops, he signed anything, he signed body parts.
[03:10:59.624 --> 03:11:04.607]  I mean, you know, people's, soldiers' uniforms and arms, it was crazy.
[03:11:04.947 --> 03:11:08.309]  So, for them to bring this up is disingenuous, that's number one.
[03:11:08.809 --> 03:11:12.131]  The other aspect of this, and you hit it too,
[03:11:12.931 --> 03:11:15.754]  This is a constant barrage, in my view.
[03:11:16.734 --> 03:11:22.339]  Anything Donald Trump stands for, it's always going to be discontinued forward.
[03:11:22.379 --> 03:11:27.043]  In other words, you mentioned even a baby falls asleep once in a while.
[03:11:27.303 --> 03:11:28.064]  These people don't.
[03:11:28.724 --> 03:11:42.035]  And it's funny because yesterday, I was taking my rage, I shouldn't say rage, the fact that I can't talk too well, I figured, okay, I'll start writing.
[03:11:42.914 --> 03:11:53.880]  And on my Twitter account, at Hagman PI, shameless plug there by the way, but not really, Philippe Raines, and how many people know who Philippe Raines is?
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:58.083]  Of course the confidant of, one of the confidants of Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:59.524 --> 03:12:06.888]  He got into this, well, Iraq, President Trump went to Iraq because he was shamed into it, as I mentioned earlier.
[03:12:08.095 --> 03:12:13.319]  When I told him to put his pants back on and get off my lawn, he blocked me.
[03:12:13.579 --> 03:12:15.601]  Here's the only reason I mention that.
[03:12:16.361 --> 03:12:17.902]  Even if we were to argue the facts as they are,
[03:12:34.131 --> 03:12:34.992]  They're not going to listen.
[03:12:35.292 --> 03:12:40.335]  And that's why you said, and I'll turn it back to you, the ideological divide is so great.
[03:12:41.176 --> 03:12:46.819]  It's just, I don't, you know what, and I'd toss this out, I think we might have done this the last time we were on.
[03:12:47.380 --> 03:12:54.985]  My question to the people listening out there, InfoWars, to InfoWars, InfoWarsStore.com, by the way, support this endeavor.
[03:12:55.005 --> 03:12:56.566]  But my question to you folks is this.
[03:12:57.927 --> 03:13:01.549]  We talk about the possibility of a civil war, alright?
[03:13:01.689 --> 03:13:02.650]  How bad it could be.
[03:13:03.777 --> 03:13:08.639]  My question, could not having a civil war be worse?
[03:13:09.019 --> 03:13:11.439]  What could be worse than having a civil war?
[03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:13.420]  Perhaps not having one.
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:19.982]  Now, I'm not wishing, and believe me, anyone who would wish a civil war on a country would be psychotic.
[03:13:20.939 --> 03:13:23.220]  There's differences in war and types of war.
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:25.761]  I mean, we're engaged in a battle right now.
[03:13:25.801 --> 03:13:29.343]  It doesn't have to be a hot war with bullets and missiles that we're saying.
[03:13:29.403 --> 03:13:36.546]  I mean, we're in an ideological civil war right now and it's playing out, you know, each and every day in the social...
[03:13:37.126 --> 03:13:37.427]  I don't
[03:13:53.707 --> 03:14:08.657]  I remember a time when you could have a disagreement with somebody and you could have a debate and you there were there wasn't two sets of facts people would you know come to the understanding that okay maybe I'm not exactly right but what I see with this that is so dangerous is that these people think they know everything.
[03:14:08.937 --> 03:14:10.659]  And they think they know what's best for everybody else.
[03:14:10.959 --> 03:14:12.842]  And it's their way or no way at all.
[03:14:13.202 --> 03:14:17.887]  And if you don't agree or subscribe to their way of thinking, you're automatically labeled an enemy.
[03:14:17.927 --> 03:14:23.574]  You're automatically labeled with an ism, you know, racism, whatever the term is of the day.
[03:14:23.814 --> 03:14:24.214]  We're good to go.
[03:14:51.332 --> 03:14:53.395]  The most sane and normal person otherwise.
[03:14:53.435 --> 03:14:58.781]  But when you start talking about politics, when you start talking about the president, it's like a switch goes off in her head.
[03:14:58.841 --> 03:15:03.467]  And she thinks he's the most evil person to ever live on the face of the earth.
[03:15:04.008 --> 03:15:09.695]  And nothing he would do could be good, no matter what it was, even if it was something she supported and agreed with.
[03:15:09.995 --> 03:15:10.995]  And that makes no sense to me.
[03:15:11.015 --> 03:15:14.476]  And that shows me that there's a much bigger component here than just politics.
[03:15:14.496 --> 03:15:15.636]  This is a spiritual battle.
[03:15:16.037 --> 03:15:19.357]  And this is a spiritual blindness and deception that we are fighting against.
[03:15:19.437 --> 03:15:24.439]  And until we understand that and fight that properly, we're not going to make much headway.
[03:15:25.059 --> 03:15:29.360]  Especially when we're dealing with the evil that this Earth has...
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:30.900]  Amen to that.
[03:15:30.980 --> 03:15:31.401]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:31.421 --> 03:15:33.401]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:15:33.421 --> 03:15:34.962]  Following, of course, Mike Adams.
[03:15:34.982 --> 03:15:35.882]  Folks, support this endeavor.
[03:15:36.163 --> 03:15:36.683]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:15:36.723 --> 03:15:37.543]  Big sale going on there.
[03:15:37.683 --> 03:15:38.043]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:38.063 --> 03:15:38.584]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:38.604 --> 03:15:38.884]  Stay with us.
[03:16:03.677 --> 03:16:08.354]  This past weekend, I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[03:16:09.699 --> 03:16:13.601]  While I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald Living Section.
[03:16:15.022 --> 03:16:19.824]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe.
[03:16:20.484 --> 03:16:22.625]  It's all packaged very, very slickly.
[03:16:23.506 --> 03:16:33.811]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23, 2018, Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[03:16:34.551 --> 03:16:40.856]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker ray on your television, right?
[03:16:41.417 --> 03:16:42.037]  I'm not kidding.
[03:16:42.998 --> 03:16:48.482]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[03:16:49.663 --> 03:16:52.646]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[03:16:53.066 --> 03:16:55.448]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[03:16:56.937 --> 03:16:58.438]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[03:16:58.998 --> 03:17:07.164]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college, and boys are depressed, and boys can't get jobs, and... You know what the problem is?
[03:17:07.424 --> 03:17:08.445]  Boys are boys.
[03:17:08.485 --> 03:17:12.848]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish, and how to be in dance class.
[03:17:13.728 --> 03:17:15.970]  That's right, we need to teach them how to be like girls.
[03:17:17.709 --> 03:17:23.093]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[03:17:23.333 --> 03:17:28.397]  He worries that the people they interview in here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[03:17:30.143 --> 03:17:33.004]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[03:17:34.124 --> 03:17:37.625]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[03:17:38.085 --> 03:17:42.386]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[03:17:42.406 --> 03:17:49.247]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[03:17:49.967 --> 03:17:55.889]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[03:17:58.186 --> 03:18:01.633]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[03:18:01.653 --> 03:18:06.402]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[03:18:07.870 --> 03:18:08.250]  I don't know.
[03:18:32.072 --> 03:18:34.134]  Made sure everybody stayed in line.
[03:18:34.495 --> 03:18:37.457]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[03:18:38.579 --> 03:18:42.222]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[03:18:42.803 --> 03:18:44.564]  The whole human species is under attack.
[03:18:45.826 --> 03:18:52.692]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[03:18:53.513 --> 03:19:02.031]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[03:19:03.894 --> 03:19:08.957]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[03:19:09.897 --> 03:19:23.345]  We're three or four generations into this, and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms and help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[03:19:24.186 --> 03:19:25.326]  That's how we're going to save them.
[03:19:26.207 --> 03:19:30.749]  Just like LBJ bragged 45 years ago that he'd have black people.
[03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:37.732]  Voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[03:19:38.712 --> 03:19:39.712]  And that's how they operate.
[03:19:40.372 --> 03:19:43.953]  The article is sickening and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[03:19:44.514 --> 03:19:49.395]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[03:19:49.495 --> 03:19:52.736]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[03:19:53.056 --> 03:19:56.337]  They're the ones destroying your identity while claiming they're protecting it.
[03:19:56.437 --> 03:20:00.718]  They're the ones telling you what to be while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[03:20:06.764 --> 03:20:09.372]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:30.342 --> 03:20:36.809]  And welcome back to the fourth hour on this Thursday edition of InfoWars on this December 27, 2018 edition.
[03:20:37.690 --> 03:20:39.071]  One of the last broadcasts of the year.
[03:20:39.091 --> 03:20:41.774]  We're really running out of time in 2018-2019.
[03:20:41.834 --> 03:20:44.777]  Right around the corner and time is just flying by.
[03:20:44.797 --> 03:20:46.519]  I want to mention this real quick, folks.
[03:20:46.559 --> 03:20:50.744]  If you haven't checked out Paul Joseph Watson's latest video, I had a chance to listen to it this morning.
[03:20:51.264 --> 03:21:18.336]  And I it was really good a very sad story there were a pair of murders there was a double murder in Morocco by it done by Islamists and it was an ISIS style execution by beheading and the state TV the state-sponsored TV has been censoring the coverage of this murder and refusing to put place the blame where it belongs on the on Islam instead they are you know
[03:21:18.336 --> 03:21:18.696]  We're good.
[03:21:32.088 --> 03:21:36.472]  TV doing what they can to cover up the origins and reasons behind those murders.
[03:21:37.013 --> 03:21:38.094]  What is happening in Europe?
[03:21:38.134 --> 03:21:42.678]  This is a reoccurring theme and again go to check out Paul Joseph Watson's video.
[03:21:42.698 --> 03:21:47.883]  He did a great job as he always does in breaking down these issues because it's so important.
[03:21:47.923 --> 03:21:49.585]  This is at the doorsteps of America too.
[03:21:49.605 --> 03:21:53.449]  We see the transformation of our society happening in many places around the country.
[03:21:53.849 --> 03:21:54.189]  I don't know.
[03:22:07.722 --> 03:22:08.702]  Genital mutilation.
[03:22:08.822 --> 03:22:09.443]  There you go.
[03:22:09.623 --> 03:22:10.843]  Female genital mutilation.
[03:22:11.463 --> 03:22:16.745]  That it was unconstitutional to disallow people of the Islamic faith to do that.
[03:22:17.145 --> 03:22:21.947]  And this is bringing Sharia law into America and becoming Sharia compliant.
[03:22:22.327 --> 03:22:35.951]  So we are not as deep in trouble as Europe is, but we are seeing those signs on the door and how long before they decide other parts of Sharia law should be accepted as part of a constitutional type
[03:22:36.872 --> 03:22:37.833]  It doesn't make sense.
[03:22:37.893 --> 03:22:41.316]  It doesn't make sense at all unless they are wanting to bring that here.
[03:22:41.857 --> 03:22:54.671]  You know Joe, the individual responsible for expunging a lot of that Islamic Sharia information, Jihadist information from the manuals of the FBI,
[03:22:55.749 --> 03:22:56.851]  Robert Mueller, of course.
[03:22:57.191 --> 03:23:09.286]  And we know that Robert Mueller is doing nothing except continuing his investigation on President Trump or against President Trump, much to the delight of the Democratic Socialists here.
[03:23:09.667 --> 03:23:12.951]  And again, it's to take our constitutional republic down.
[03:23:13.211 --> 03:23:14.413]  Make no mistake about this.
[03:23:15.033 --> 03:23:25.649]  And yes, Sharia and the Sharia Compliance, which is antithetical to the Constitution, is part of a globalist agenda to rip at our fabric of America.
[03:23:25.669 --> 03:23:27.612]  But you know, I mentioned...
[03:23:28.757 --> 03:23:29.798]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:23:29.818 --> 03:23:40.546]  Between James Comey and Robert Mueller, those two as FBI directors, they have done so much damage to the FBI when dealing with Islamic terrorism.
[03:23:41.007 --> 03:23:51.975]  And they have, you know, when we looked at Robert Mueller and we hear people saying, oh he, when the investigation started, that he was one of the most upstanding, you know, moral people, the perfect guy for the job.
[03:23:52.295 --> 03:23:57.940]  Well, he's got a laundry list of conflicts of interest, of shady dealings, and of
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:23:59.301]  We're good to go.
[03:24:19.433 --> 03:24:22.556]  And the government will say, no, no, no, no, don't worry, it's not terrorism.
[03:24:23.117 --> 03:24:26.060]  It's domestic, it's workplace violence, like the Fort Hood shooting.
[03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:28.582]  And that's when it really started to open my eyes.
[03:24:28.943 --> 03:24:32.266]  When the Fort Hood shooting happened, they said it was workplace violence.
[03:24:33.132 --> 03:24:35.854]  Well, it makes me think, too, about Mueller.
[03:24:36.294 --> 03:24:44.500]  We had, of course, folks, HagmanReport.com, that's our website, that's our home base, Hagman Report live for our show, 7 to 10 weeknights, 7 to 10 p.m.
[03:24:44.540 --> 03:24:45.360]  Eastern Time, weeknights.
[03:24:46.601 --> 03:24:54.947]  But we had John Milkovich on, and he's the author of this book, Robert Mueller, errand boy for the New World Order.
[03:24:54.987 --> 03:25:01.211]  Now, I don't get paid for talking about this, we don't make any money off this book, but
[03:25:02.408 --> 03:25:12.953]  He talks about the, well, in this book is a report, and he's a state senator from Louisiana, I believe, 38th District of Louisiana, okay?
[03:25:13.473 --> 03:25:23.217]  But he writes that there's an epic disconnect between Robert Mueller, described by the mass media, and officialdom as a model of public propriety, as a model
[03:25:25.131 --> 03:25:25.351]  Let's
[03:25:45.227 --> 03:25:48.109]  Mueller was tasked to do, he is doing it exquisitely.
[03:25:48.590 --> 03:25:55.615]  So anyone who would ever believe in any sense of the word that Mueller was a white hat, or is a white hat, is delusional.
[03:25:56.155 --> 03:26:03.340]  But one thing, one real quick thing, I don't want to get too far off what you were talking about, the Hill today.
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:12.787]  This is so critical for people to understand, because Joe, you and I were following the prosecution of General Michael Flynn.
[03:26:13.522 --> 03:26:20.868]  Well, in the Hill today, real quick, an article by Kevin Brock and Dan Bongino mentioned it this morning on his podcast.
[03:26:20.908 --> 03:26:21.809]  I just want to mention it right now.
[03:26:21.849 --> 03:26:24.911]  There are three oddities in FBI handling of Flynn interview.
[03:26:25.051 --> 03:26:26.773]  And frankly, I did not catch this.
[03:26:26.793 --> 03:26:30.716]  And I just want to toss this over to you right after this.
[03:26:31.528 --> 03:26:36.489]  The three oddities, again, this is an article by Kevin Brock, writing in The Hill.
[03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:44.091]  One of the biggest issues here, and I did not think of this, I didn't catch this, and I wonder how many people did.
[03:26:45.531 --> 03:26:51.732]  The 302s, there were two 302s that were done on Flynn.
[03:26:52.392 --> 03:26:59.134]  One, rather contemporaneously, or right around the time of his January 2017 interview, the two agents interviewing Flynn.
[03:26:59.794 --> 03:27:00.435]  They completed a 302.
[03:27:00.475 --> 03:27:05.620]  And of course there was an August 302 that the FBI completed.
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:15.811]  Now having said that, what was the basis, what was the underlying predicate for interviewing Flynn in the first place?
[03:27:16.712 --> 03:27:18.634]  It was what kind of investigation?
[03:27:18.794 --> 03:27:20.616]  It was a counterintelligence investigation.
[03:27:21.456 --> 03:27:22.057]  And even the
[03:27:23.836 --> 03:27:44.313]  And as an aside, the Washington Post has leaked to the Washington Post by the intelligence community about Michael Flynn the day before his interview, or around the time of his interview, I should say, that there was no indication of any wrongdoing.
[03:27:47.576 --> 03:27:47.636]  302s.
[03:27:47.996 --> 03:27:50.298]  I guess here's the bottom line in one of the oddities.
[03:27:50.318 --> 03:27:50.338]  302s.
[03:27:52.970 --> 03:27:55.071]  Are criminal documents.
[03:27:55.131 --> 03:28:03.697]  In other words, documents to record a statement in a criminal investigation, not a counterintelligence investigation.
[03:28:04.717 --> 03:28:09.941]  So what in the hell were two FBI agents doing?
[03:28:11.682 --> 03:28:19.667]  Creating a 302 on a counterintelligence investigation, unless it was never designed to be a counterintelligence investigation.
[03:28:21.436 --> 03:28:21.956]  Interesting.
[03:28:23.137 --> 03:28:24.258]  So think about that.
[03:28:24.658 --> 03:28:24.878]  Yeah.
[03:28:25.318 --> 03:28:25.978]  Think about that.
[03:28:26.118 --> 03:28:29.440]  And folks, go ahead Joe, you can take us on.
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:34.822]  Just real quick, I mean we have not seen, I want to see the declassified information.
[03:28:34.862 --> 03:28:38.444]  I want to see, I don't know why the documents have not been declassified.
[03:28:38.464 --> 03:28:42.646]  I don't know why the president has not decided to just put everything out there.
[03:28:42.926 --> 03:28:45.167]  You know the FBI talks about protecting sources and methods.
[03:28:45.527 --> 03:28:48.188]  But they were weaponized against the President.
[03:28:48.448 --> 03:28:51.529]  They were weaponized against his administration and his campaign.
[03:28:51.869 --> 03:29:01.572]  And that information needs to come out so we understand the full scope of the criminality behind the Obama administration and the weaponization of the intelligence agencies against President Donald Trump.
[03:29:04.383 --> 03:29:06.224]  We're ending the year.
[03:29:06.604 --> 03:29:07.585]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[03:29:07.665 --> 03:29:08.585]  It's been an insane year.
[03:29:09.886 --> 03:29:17.450]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:29.496]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[03:29:30.536 --> 03:29:31.337]  And that the globalists
[03:29:32.455 --> 03:29:38.677]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[03:29:38.697 --> 03:29:44.118]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[03:29:44.138 --> 03:29:46.838]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[03:29:47.179 --> 03:29:49.159]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[03:29:50.819 --> 03:29:52.680]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[03:29:52.720 --> 03:29:55.100]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[03:29:55.941 --> 03:29:58.581]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[03:29:59.942 --> 03:30:01.322]  But our aircraft didn't have
[03:30:03.018 --> 03:30:05.279]  Radar.
[03:30:05.419 --> 03:30:16.524]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[03:30:16.744 --> 03:30:27.229]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[03:30:28.330 --> 03:30:30.291]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[03:30:31.294 --> 03:30:34.357]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[03:30:35.258 --> 03:30:42.465]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[03:30:42.485 --> 03:30:48.491]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[03:30:48.891 --> 03:30:51.234]  That's a separate battle.
[03:30:52.655 --> 03:30:53.036]  And so...
[03:30:55.185 --> 03:30:59.949]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[03:31:00.450 --> 03:31:03.232]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[03:31:04.093 --> 03:31:09.477]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[03:31:10.358 --> 03:31:17.965]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[03:31:19.858 --> 03:31:23.562]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[03:31:24.363 --> 03:31:30.209]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[03:31:30.269 --> 03:31:34.132]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[03:31:35.228 --> 03:31:44.051]  I want to point out, we've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[03:31:44.451 --> 03:31:57.454]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[03:31:57.674 --> 03:31:59.395]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[03:32:00.396 --> 03:32:08.660]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[03:32:09.380 --> 03:32:14.602]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[03:32:15.103 --> 03:32:18.584]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[03:32:19.324 --> 03:32:26.668]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[03:32:27.148 --> 03:32:29.329]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[03:32:29.970 --> 03:32:30.418]  I'm killed.
[03:32:31.613 --> 03:32:32.413]  The end of this year.
[03:32:33.293 --> 03:32:45.116]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[03:32:45.176 --> 03:32:50.938]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item, like colloidal silver, or something like that.
[03:32:50.978 --> 03:32:56.639]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[03:32:57.039 --> 03:32:58.499]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:58.680 --> 03:33:00.300]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:33:06.253 --> 03:33:09.014]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.594 --> 03:33:17.175]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:18.075 --> 03:33:23.996]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Doug Agman.
[03:33:36.958 --> 03:33:44.644]  Doug and Joe Hagman here from the Hagman Report filling in for Alex Jones on this fourth hour of this Thursday edition on this December 27th, 2018.
[03:33:44.804 --> 03:34:04.441]  We were talking about Robert Mueller before the break here and a number of things that he has been in the news about, including the most important, which is the investigation into President Trump for Russian collusion, which has moved well beyond any collusion now into, you know, looking at obstruction and anything they can
[03:34:04.921 --> 03:34:15.717]  Get their hands on to try to undermine and destroy the president and his reputation and what he has been able to accomplish and that's one of the things that we have to be grateful for when we look back at 2018 and 2017 even 2016 is the fact that every intelligence agency
[03:34:20.343 --> 03:34:38.728]  Every law enforcement agency federally at least Seemed to be weaponized didn't seem to be it was weaponized against President Trump and his administration in his campaign First and foremost and he was able to overcome that I'm not sure that any one man alone could do something like that I think there is much more at play than just a
[03:34:39.549 --> 03:34:40.510]  Uh, politics.
[03:34:42.092 --> 03:34:55.090]  There is a spiritual component here that must be recognized and he continues to have successes even in the face of all these enemies that have been piled up up against him and all these agencies that have been weaponized against him.
[03:34:55.530 --> 03:35:02.821]  He continues to succeed and we can't, no matter what is going on, forget that and we have to be thankful for that because at least we have that.
[03:35:02.841 --> 03:35:05.926]  Just imagine what it would be like if Hillary Clinton was president.
[03:35:05.946 --> 03:35:11.134]  I read something that she tweeted out, something, some kind of Christmas message.
[03:35:11.674 --> 03:35:11.774]  Yeah.
[03:35:33.712 --> 03:35:34.332]  Just disappear.
[03:35:34.693 --> 03:35:46.286]  I mean, no other, except for Hillary Clinton, really, in my memory, no other evidence in the FBI just disappears unless there is somebody who is making it disappear.
[03:35:46.866 --> 03:35:52.393]  And how convenient for these people that this evidence just goes bye-bye, but how much
[03:35:53.173 --> 03:35:54.674]  Is Robert Mueller on the hook for this?
[03:35:54.754 --> 03:35:56.254]  I mean, he's overseeing this investigation.
[03:35:56.274 --> 03:35:57.635]  This is his evidence.
[03:35:57.655 --> 03:35:59.115]  This is his information, right?
[03:35:59.716 --> 03:36:02.457]  And the Inspector General, too.
[03:36:03.117 --> 03:36:04.818]  We have to ask, what is going on with this?
[03:36:04.858 --> 03:36:09.680]  But Buck Sexton, he wrote, I'm sorry, John Solomon wrote this opinion piece up on the Hill.
[03:36:10.180 --> 03:36:13.101]  And he talks about what Rudy Giuliani says.
[03:36:13.161 --> 03:36:16.222]  And he says that it's time for Robert Mueller to be investigated.
[03:36:16.262 --> 03:36:17.743]  And we've talked about this for a long time.
[03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:21.470]  Can the President, should the President fire Robert Mueller?
[03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:22.391]  When would be a good time?
[03:36:22.731 --> 03:36:33.238]  I thought when the Attorney General switch was made, and the announcement from Mueller saying that they were not going to focus on Russian collusion, that the mandate was going to be basically anything but that.
[03:36:33.599 --> 03:36:36.721]  Moving forward, that was when the President should have pulled the trigger.
[03:36:37.181 --> 03:36:38.942]  Now, a lot of people don't agree with me.
[03:36:39.002 --> 03:36:43.045]  They think he should just let them stay the course, since if they were going to find anything, they would have already found it.
[03:36:43.545 --> 03:36:49.209]  But obviously, we see dissenting opinions, especially even on Fox News and Judge Napolitano.
[03:36:49.950 --> 03:36:52.414]  I haven't really been listening to a lot of what he's been saying lately.
[03:36:52.434 --> 03:36:55.259]  Oh, lucky you.
[03:36:55.739 --> 03:37:02.971]  Yeah, he's saying things like Trump should resign or they're going to indict his kids and they have stuff to go after him on.
[03:37:04.637 --> 03:37:10.219]  It just seems like everything and everyone just wants to see Trump fail.
[03:37:10.739 --> 03:37:17.222]  And as we said earlier, the divide in this country seems to be along the lines of whether you like the president or you don't like the president.
[03:37:17.502 --> 03:37:19.323]  But it is much deeper than that.
[03:37:19.683 --> 03:37:33.168]  But will Robert Mueller, will James Comey, will any of these people ever be held accountable in any way that is satisfactory to the American public out there who have been paying attention, who know the crimes that have been committed by these people?
[03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:36.381]  That's my big problem.
[03:37:37.422 --> 03:37:40.424]  Joe, I'll just chime in here, while I still can.
[03:37:41.464 --> 03:37:44.526]  The investigation is the obstruction.
[03:37:44.926 --> 03:37:55.872]  And if you think about this, Huber, John Huber, working with OIG Horowitz, can't testify to an ongoing investigation.
[03:37:57.954 --> 03:38:03.477]  Comey, for example, can't testify or testify about or provide information about
[03:38:04.509 --> 03:38:05.990]  X, Y, or Z. Because why?
[03:38:06.010 --> 03:38:07.792]  The investigation is ongoing.
[03:38:07.812 --> 03:38:09.834]  Don't want to compromise an ongoing investigation.
[03:38:10.334 --> 03:38:13.937]  Now, if that was a legitimate investigation, obviously, I understand that.
[03:38:14.658 --> 03:38:19.763]  But the investigation is going to keep the obstruction alive.
[03:38:20.443 --> 03:38:29.151]  In other words, the endgame objective here is to keep the Mueller investigation going until President Trump is out of office.
[03:38:30.095 --> 03:38:33.057]  And we're at, what, day number, I think, 590.
[03:38:33.978 --> 03:38:37.961]  A year, six months, and I think 12 days of the Mueller investigation.
[03:38:40.563 --> 03:38:46.987]  Out of, what, 707 days of the, like 590 days out of 707 days of the presidency.
[03:38:47.828 --> 03:38:52.351]  So this is the tactic, I believe, of the Mueller investigation.
[03:38:52.711 --> 03:38:58.816]  And the intent of the Mueller investigation, continue forward until Donald Trump is either forced out of office,
[03:38:59.788 --> 03:39:01.429]  Or something else takes place.
[03:39:01.589 --> 03:39:02.389]  And I'll tell you something.
[03:39:02.409 --> 03:39:03.910]  Roger Stone... Maybe he's not going to leave.
[03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:05.151]  Well, yeah.
[03:39:05.431 --> 03:39:11.354]  And Roger Stone and Alex had a very good piece, and I would not... I'm going to tell everyone out there.
[03:39:14.355 --> 03:39:26.221]  I saw it over the weekend, over the holiday weekend, where Roger Stone was talking about, talking with Alex, and they were talking about, as much as I hate to say this, the removal from office with prejudice.
[03:39:26.401 --> 03:39:28.162]  And I think people understand what that means.
[03:39:29.625 --> 03:39:32.968]  Look, Donald Trump, there's no chaos in the office.
[03:39:32.988 --> 03:39:34.309]  There's no chaos in the White House.
[03:39:34.869 --> 03:39:39.513]  Everything else is... People who say that there is, that's fake news.
[03:39:39.673 --> 03:39:40.254]  Well, you know what?
[03:39:40.334 --> 03:39:40.794]  I'll say this.
[03:39:41.615 --> 03:39:49.881]  There's chaos to the extent that the deep state holdovers, the Obama loyalists, the communist progressives, to the extent that they create.
[03:39:50.061 --> 03:39:51.983]  There's not chaos being created by President Trump.
[03:39:52.023 --> 03:39:57.607]  There's chaos being created by the people who refuse to allow his agenda to be implemented.
[03:39:57.967 --> 03:40:03.030]  And we know when we read it in, I believe it was one of the books when we were in D.C.
[03:40:03.050 --> 03:40:08.734]  when the confirmation hearings for, oh my goodness, the Supreme Court Kavanaugh was going on.
[03:40:09.074 --> 03:40:19.221]  And the book came out by Woodward and they talked about that and they said how many of the workers in the White House refused to submit paperwork, would hide things.
[03:40:19.261 --> 03:40:20.101]  So the President didn't see?
[03:40:20.121 --> 03:40:20.942]  I mean, things like that.
[03:40:21.422 --> 03:40:23.163]  That's the only chaos that I really see.
[03:40:23.443 --> 03:40:33.147]  The turnover, as far as the personnel, does not bother me because you can have a position and fill it with 10 different people, but until you get that right person in there, you have to get the right person in there.
[03:40:33.167 --> 03:40:35.989]  You can have that turnover as long as you're getting the right people in there.
[03:40:36.029 --> 03:40:37.589]  So I don't see that as chaos.
[03:40:37.870 --> 03:40:47.254]  But everything that the President, I mean, just look, as I mentioned earlier, the coverage about the President not only going to Iraq, but CNN, they're saying Trump is the Grinch who stole Christmas from the troops in Iraq.
[03:40:47.674 --> 03:40:54.218]  CNN does its best to dump on Trump troops trip and then it goes on from there on News Busters.
[03:40:54.258 --> 03:40:55.459]  I'm just reading headlines here.
[03:40:55.539 --> 03:40:59.021]  CBS, NBC slammed Trump's visit to troops in Iraq.
[03:40:59.061 --> 03:40:59.821]  Took him long enough.
[03:40:59.861 --> 03:41:03.203]  So some say, you know, he didn't go there quick enough.
[03:41:03.224 --> 03:41:04.885]  Others say he should never be there in the first place.
[03:41:05.185 --> 03:41:06.966]  How dare he sign maggot hats and give them...
[03:41:07.586 --> 03:41:07.746]  Yeah.
[03:41:07.886 --> 03:41:10.308]  How dare he sign MAGA hats and give it to the troops?
[03:41:10.368 --> 03:41:14.430]  I mean, he's the Grinch who sold Christmas for the troops in Iraq, according to CNN.
[03:41:14.771 --> 03:41:16.432]  I mean, but the troops love him.
[03:41:16.972 --> 03:41:24.437]  From everything I can see, why don't they let the troops speak for themselves instead of, you know, always trying to put words and feelings in other people's mouths?
[03:41:24.537 --> 03:41:24.797]  It's just...
[03:41:25.337 --> 03:41:27.398]  It really is irritating.
[03:41:27.658 --> 03:41:30.319]  And what is the media going to do whenever Trump is out of office?
[03:41:30.459 --> 03:41:31.940]  I mean, what are they going to focus on?
[03:41:32.240 --> 03:41:33.641]  What's their obsession going to be?
[03:41:33.681 --> 03:41:35.642]  Because that's all they can talk about right now.
[03:41:36.062 --> 03:41:43.885]  And it puts us in a position where we seem to always be, not defending him, but trying to just put the facts out there to say what's right.
[03:41:44.246 --> 03:41:45.986]  But there's so much more we could be focusing on.
[03:41:46.006 --> 03:41:53.890]  And it is keeping us, or we're keeping us, from working on those solutions because we're so preoccupied dealing with what the networks are putting out.
[03:41:54.190 --> 03:41:54.891]  That has to change.
[03:41:54.911 --> 03:41:55.851]  We have to change that somehow.
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:10.361]  We're good to go.
[03:42:39.236 --> 03:42:41.998]  Since the time of Plato, 2300 plus years ago,
[03:43:09.565 --> 03:43:12.208]  Elites believe that the Earth was overpopulated.
[03:43:13.249 --> 03:43:21.558]  Now, you could argue that today, but in the time of Plato, there wasn't more than 100,000 people on the Greek islands.
[03:43:22.719 --> 03:43:28.225]  But in his Republic, he wrote about humans crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[03:43:29.706 --> 03:43:30.747]  And it was his ideas
[03:43:32.655 --> 03:43:36.378]  2,000 years later that were picked up by Malthus.
[03:43:37.359 --> 03:43:38.020]  Sir Malthus.
[03:43:39.021 --> 03:43:49.871]  Malthus wanted to herd people in Ireland and in England to pour people into tiny, small, 200-foot apartments so that they would fester with disease and die.
[03:43:49.891 --> 03:43:52.574]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[03:43:52.594 --> 03:43:55.616]  That means you just believe in making things worse.
[03:43:56.417 --> 03:44:00.239]  So that you get rid of the poor people, you get rid of the dumb people, you get rid of the stupid people.
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:09.865]  He predicted that within a hundred years, that was the 1700s, he predicted by the 1800s, the Earth would reach its carrying potential.
[03:44:10.785 --> 03:44:14.888]  There would be a planetary collapse of the entire human population.
[03:44:15.588 --> 03:44:23.513]  So when you hear about eugenics, and you read about the UN saying we're overpopulated, and you see them pushing for global one-child policies,
[03:44:24.938 --> 03:44:35.721]  Remember that this has been a long-term view of aristocrats, of royalty, of oligarchs, of plutocrats for 2,000 plus years.
[03:44:36.821 --> 03:44:42.263]  And really what they use this for is a way to dehumanize the general public.
[03:44:42.943 --> 03:44:43.683]  Why educate?
[03:44:43.763 --> 03:44:44.784]  Why have sewage?
[03:44:44.844 --> 03:44:48.265]  Why have sanitation if these people are animals to begin with?
[03:44:49.446 --> 03:44:56.033]  But see, once sanitation and things were adopted 150 years ago, infectious diseases went down over 95%.
[03:44:56.474 --> 03:44:59.037]  So then the eugenicists met and they said, what are we going to do?
[03:45:00.038 --> 03:45:03.181]  People aren't dying from infectious diseases, the Malthusian plan is failing.
[03:45:03.201 --> 03:45:08.488]  They said, we'll take all these good scientists and people that have developed all these vaccines and things that are good.
[03:45:09.308 --> 03:45:14.151]  And we'll take control of these with modern medical science through the Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:45:14.831 --> 03:45:17.533]  And we'll actually control it and make everything worse.
[03:45:18.293 --> 03:45:20.154]  Cancer was incredibly rare 100 years ago.
[03:45:20.794 --> 03:45:24.617]  By the 20s, the Rockefellers had discovered most of it was viral and weaponized it.
[03:45:25.377 --> 03:45:26.938]  And there's hundreds of other examples.
[03:45:28.598 --> 03:45:38.226]  So when you pull back from this and understand that it's not that environmentalism is bad, it's good, but the bad guys run it, not to help the earth or people, but to control it.
[03:45:38.666 --> 03:45:44.791]  When you realize that vaccine technology is good and real, but that bad guys have it and are adding Trojan horses, then you understand.
[03:45:45.552 --> 03:45:51.696]  Just like computers are good, but then they can be used for bad with Trojan horses to control.
[03:45:51.716 --> 03:45:55.820]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[03:45:57.122 --> 03:45:58.744]  That's why you have an attack on the family.
[03:45:58.984 --> 03:46:00.506]  That's why you have an attack on the middle class.
[03:46:00.786 --> 03:46:04.710]  That's why globalists want to make populations poor and stupid and controllable.
[03:46:05.431 --> 03:46:07.994]  Because only one level of the eugenics operation
[03:46:10.895 --> 03:46:21.304]  The truth is, they're just using it as an excuse to dehumanize all life, throw chivalry out the window, and treat their fellow humans like they're animals.
[03:46:22.164 --> 03:46:29.290]  Because the globalists are sociopathic and psychotic in their spectrum, and they project their own hatred on the public.
[03:46:30.251 --> 03:46:50.227]  And their own loathing of themselves on the public, and then cover it, claiming that they're nothing but social Darwinists, carrying out a cleansing of the Earth, when they're the ones with the open-air genetic engineering, they're the ones with the gene splicing, they're the ones with the human-animal chimeras, they're the ones with the atmospheric manipulations, when they're the ones endangering the entire planet.
[03:46:51.027 --> 03:46:52.789]  So as we go into the new year, understand this.
[03:46:52.809 --> 03:46:53.649]  A 2,300-year plan
[03:46:55.931 --> 03:46:58.094]  He's fighting against a plan for a pro-human future.
[03:46:58.434 --> 03:46:59.835]  Choose renaissance, not death.
[03:47:00.136 --> 03:47:01.177]  Choose Infowars.
[03:47:06.263 --> 03:47:08.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.689 --> 03:47:33.092]  Doug and Joe Hackman here, filling in for the fourth hour on InfoWars on this Thursday, December 27, 2018.
[03:47:33.913 --> 03:47:36.855]  One of the last broadcasts of the year.
[03:47:36.915 --> 03:47:37.816]  We covered a lot of ground.
[03:47:37.836 --> 03:47:39.057]  We still got a lot to talk about.
[03:47:39.357 --> 03:47:45.262]  We have this government shutdown that's been ongoing, I believe it is into day six, over the border wall funding.
[03:47:46.022 --> 03:47:52.788]  We saw the GoFundMe page the President started for the border wall as the American people have been pouring money into it.
[03:47:53.408 --> 03:47:56.711]  Before, I haven't seen the latest update on that.
[03:47:56.751 --> 03:48:02.895]  I saw a headline, I believe, yesterday or the day before that they might have to return the money that you can't really crowdfund for a border wall.
[03:48:03.215 --> 03:48:07.038]  I'm not sure about that, but there is a lot of stuff going on with immigration and whatnot.
[03:48:08.019 --> 03:48:14.003]  We were talking about the CNN stuff and the troops in Iraq, and I don't want to jump around too much, but I just can't get over this.
[03:48:14.043 --> 03:48:16.905]  The more I'm looking here at different websites,
[03:48:17.637 --> 03:48:20.540]  Jim Acosta, one of the biggest blowhards in the news business.
[03:48:21.841 --> 03:48:26.586]  America-hating fake newser Jim Acosta leads CNN discussion on how U.S.
[03:48:26.646 --> 03:48:30.310]  troops in Iraq should be disciplined for meeting with the President.
[03:48:32.032 --> 03:48:33.333]  Did you hear this, Jim Acosta?
[03:48:35.334 --> 03:48:40.419]  Talking about how the troops should be punished for meeting with the President.
[03:48:40.439 --> 03:48:45.163]  I mean, what kind of world do we live in that we see this kind of craziness?
[03:48:45.523 --> 03:48:50.267]  How does CNN get away with saying things like this and continuing to have an audience?
[03:48:50.287 --> 03:48:55.432]  Do the people watch just for that shock factor of what idiotic and ridiculous thing they're going to say next?
[03:48:55.852 --> 03:49:01.077]  I mean, they protect the terrorists, they defend the terrorists, and they destroy the President.
[03:49:01.137 --> 03:49:02.278]  They destroy the Constitution.
[03:49:02.808 --> 03:49:03.990]  By very definition.
[03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:12.921]  I mean, to me, when President Trump claims that the fake news media is the enemy of the people, there it is right there.
[03:49:13.562 --> 03:49:16.165]  How much more explanation does one need?
[03:49:16.245 --> 03:49:19.269]  I mean, examples right there alone.
[03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.811]  Seriously.
[03:49:21.211 --> 03:49:22.072]  He's a narcissist.
[03:49:40.868 --> 03:49:47.190]  I had a great aunt who said, it would say something like, that boy ain't right.
[03:49:47.290 --> 03:49:48.350]  That boy just ain't right.
[03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:53.292]  Okay, so I can hear the echoes from my childhood.
[03:49:53.332 --> 03:49:54.372]  That boy just ain't right.
[03:49:54.452 --> 03:49:58.953]  Meaning, a friend of mine that I had introduced her to, that boy just ain't right.
[03:49:58.993 --> 03:50:00.674]  Well, Acosta, that boy just ain't right.
[03:50:01.874 --> 03:50:08.564]  Well, seriously, you talk about the enemy of the people, uh, in fake news, hey, it's right next to it.
[03:50:09.205 --> 03:50:09.706]  Absolutely.
[03:50:09.766 --> 03:50:12.971]  So, I didn't mean to interrupt, but you're right in so many things.
[03:50:13.732 --> 03:50:22.176]  As bad as, you know, all the mainstream media coverages of Trump, you don't see the White House correspondence for ABC, NBC act the way Jim Acosta acts.
[03:50:22.497 --> 03:50:24.217]  And it is being done intentionally.
[03:50:24.237 --> 03:50:28.800]  And I believe he's also probably being celebrated inside CNN.
[03:50:28.820 --> 03:50:31.301]  He's probably being incentivized.
[03:50:31.361 --> 03:50:32.582]  They're incentivizing it, I'm sure.
[03:50:32.642 --> 03:50:34.603]  He probably has got a bump in his paycheck.
[03:50:35.383 --> 03:50:44.965]  And I love how the interactions between Sarah Sanders and Jim Acosta in the press room because she just destroys him every time and he looks like such an idiot.
[03:50:45.205 --> 03:50:55.347]  But he doesn't know when to stop because he thinks that there is, and I'm sure there is, a portion of these extreme leftists out there who just applaud and enjoy that kind of stuff.
[03:50:55.387 --> 03:51:02.829]  But it is not doing any, and this is the problem, we talked about this before, there's no working towards solutions with these people.
[03:51:03.269 --> 03:51:05.514]  And should we work towards solutions with these people?
[03:51:05.534 --> 03:51:06.175]  That's the question.
[03:51:06.195 --> 03:51:09.742]  Because in my mind, the evil, it's evil.
[03:51:09.802 --> 03:51:11.986]  It's not just politics at this point.
[03:51:12.487 --> 03:51:13.830]  And if you're a Christian,
[03:51:14.978 --> 03:51:19.762]  Would you ever come to the table and sit down with somebody who wants to perform abortions?
[03:51:20.062 --> 03:51:20.242]  No.
[03:51:20.363 --> 03:51:21.443]  It's not in your blood.
[03:51:21.483 --> 03:51:22.604]  It's not in your belief system.
[03:51:22.905 --> 03:51:26.668]  So there is no middle ground, if you understand what I'm saying.
[03:51:26.948 --> 03:51:29.070]  And that's the way I feel about some of this stuff.
[03:51:29.710 --> 03:51:32.492]  And we see it in issues like I want to go to the economy.
[03:51:32.512 --> 03:51:34.134]  We see this volatility in the stock market.
[03:51:34.554 --> 03:51:43.796]  Well, obviously there's a lot of things going on there, but the level of volatility is very alarming and people are spooked and they're shocked and they're wondering what's going on.
[03:51:44.136 --> 03:51:56.038]  But the root of the problem is not capitalism, it's not the market, it's what has been done to the free market through the Federal Reserve System and the theft of the wealth from the American people.
[03:51:56.559 --> 03:52:00.359]  And how long has Alex Jones been talking about this, folks?
[03:52:00.559 --> 03:52:02.620]  Since I've started listening to him.
[03:52:02.740 --> 03:52:03.180]  Exactly.
[03:52:06.988 --> 03:52:07.388]  I can't.
[03:52:07.508 --> 03:52:08.409]  Okay, I apologize.
[03:52:09.370 --> 03:52:13.173]  I really want to hit this home forcefully, but I cannot do that.
[03:52:14.595 --> 03:52:19.359]  How many... Look, Alex Jones has been right on the money, and that's why they want to shut him down.
[03:52:19.699 --> 03:52:21.261]  That's why they want to shut Infowars down.
[03:52:21.541 --> 03:52:29.107]  And you've got a bunch of sniveling, snot-nosed, wet-behind-the-ears, snowflake crybabies.
[03:52:29.248 --> 03:52:30.669]  Am I allowed to say that on this show?
[03:52:32.310 --> 03:52:32.931]  Take to Twitter.
[03:52:33.713 --> 03:52:39.395]  They take to Twitter and they applaud, of course, the banning of InfoWars.
[03:52:39.435 --> 03:52:44.456]  They applaud the banning of multiple platforms and conservatives.
[03:52:45.897 --> 03:52:51.599]  Not realizing, not having a sense, an ounce of any common sense, that they're next.
[03:52:52.259 --> 03:52:55.060]  That these cheerleaders are for the globalists.
[03:52:55.940 --> 03:52:59.321]  They're not any use to anybody, including themselves.
[03:53:00.061 --> 03:53:01.502]  How many people do you see?
[03:53:05.196 --> 03:53:12.695]  It saddens me to the extent that these people don't understand.
[03:53:13.766 --> 03:53:16.567]  That they are applauding for their own demise.
[03:53:17.007 --> 03:53:20.828]  My goodness, what's wrong with these people?
[03:53:20.988 --> 03:53:21.328]  Go ahead.
[03:53:21.848 --> 03:53:30.290]  It's like what we see with the rise in hate crimes, where you see racist graffiti spray-painted on a school, or nooses.
[03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:32.070]  Lately, the trend has been
[03:53:35.591 --> 03:53:39.132]  These hate crimes have been committed by the people they're allegedly targeting.
[03:53:39.473 --> 03:53:41.533]  It's almost like this self-hatred.
[03:53:41.573 --> 03:53:47.836]  It's like the white people who are out there telling everybody that you're wrong to be white.
[03:53:48.156 --> 03:53:52.537]  It's a self-destructive attitude that is, in my opinion, evil.
[03:53:52.557 --> 03:53:56.979]  And it really has just completely twisted the minds of these people.
[03:53:57.739 --> 03:53:57.899]  That's
[03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:14.280]  You brought it up earlier.
[03:54:14.441 --> 03:54:14.881]  What has changed?
[03:54:30.482 --> 03:54:31.883]  And this is what people have to realize.
[03:54:33.203 --> 03:54:35.765]  Dennis Prager, Prager University, was talking about this.
[03:54:37.105 --> 03:54:46.690]  The assault against the American trinity, of course, the E Pluribus Unum, liberty, and one nation under God.
[03:54:47.070 --> 03:54:48.370]  It's the one nation under God.
[03:54:49.691 --> 03:54:56.194]  The fact that the morality of this country, the American exceptionalism... America, by the way, is an exceptional country.
[03:54:57.081 --> 03:55:00.572]  The Western culture is an exceptional culture.
[03:55:01.074 --> 03:55:03.943]  We, the West, we built this country.
[03:55:04.805 --> 03:55:05.886]  Sorry, but we did.
[03:55:06.387 --> 03:55:13.873]  And folks, you have to watch the Prager University, if you're so inclined, the video on this.
[03:55:13.913 --> 03:55:15.634]  But he was right on the money.
[03:55:16.575 --> 03:55:21.139]  The fact that this is a spiritual battle, a war against our faith.
[03:55:21.959 --> 03:55:27.264]  And what was it, was it Ben Franklin who said, or not a Republican, if you can keep it,
[03:55:30.366 --> 03:55:38.608]  So, without God, and without the idea that there is an afterlife and a punishment, the atheists out there, or the self-proclaimed atheists, or the people who don't have the belief system, the strong belief system,
[03:55:56.473 --> 03:56:01.637]  They're wholly incapable of governance, and of accepting this governance.
[03:56:01.677 --> 03:56:01.978]  Go ahead.
[03:56:02.738 --> 03:56:07.642]  And you know, we talk about this a lot, and even on our show, we're Christians by faith.
[03:56:08.743 --> 03:56:22.195]  At the same time, these people, if you don't believe in God, I have nothing against you, but these people take it to a whole new level, where they don't believe in God, yet at the same time they hate Him, and then they have turned their ideology, their political ideology, into their religion.
[03:56:22.575 --> 03:56:27.677]  Which includes, you know, the love of abortion, which includes, you know, the open borders.
[03:56:27.737 --> 03:56:37.060]  And what does it say when the government has to be shut down and all the president is asking for is money to fund a border wall, to secure our sovereign nation.
[03:56:37.380 --> 03:56:45.142]  And that is being met with such resistance, you would think he is, you know, advocating unifying with Mexico and starting a new country.
[03:56:45.182 --> 03:56:47.443]  It just doesn't, it doesn't compute in my mind.
[03:56:47.463 --> 03:56:50.664]  Yeah, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Moano, do you lock your cricket doors?
[03:56:51.284 --> 03:56:53.705]  Listen, Moana, do you lock your doors?
[03:56:55.226 --> 03:56:57.187]  Hey, Schumer, do you lock your doors?
[03:56:58.347 --> 03:57:02.929]  You got security details?
[03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:07.451]  I mean, they're hubris and they're hypocrisy.
[03:57:08.112 --> 03:57:08.332]  Yeah.
[03:57:08.512 --> 03:57:09.413]  Joe, it's just, wow.
[03:57:09.673 --> 03:57:10.194]  Go ahead.
[03:57:10.654 --> 03:57:14.777]  It's like one of the Parkland victims, one of the more outspoken anti-gun victims.
[03:57:14.817 --> 03:57:15.798]  I don't remember her name.
[03:57:15.898 --> 03:57:21.202]  Emma Gonzalez, I think it was, attended a rally where Alyssa Milano was, and this was months ago.
[03:57:21.763 --> 03:57:26.967]  And they were railing against guns while having armed security standing there protecting them.
[03:57:27.267 --> 03:57:29.249]  And that's what doesn't make sense.
[03:57:29.329 --> 03:57:30.189]  It's the hypocrisy.
[03:57:30.610 --> 03:57:33.652]  And as I said, the spiritual aspect of this is so important.
[03:57:33.852 --> 03:57:37.115]  We need to understand it's a spiritual battle first and foremost.
[03:57:37.455 --> 03:57:38.577]  Folks, thanks for having us today.
[03:57:38.677 --> 03:57:39.859]  Infowars.com.
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:41.021]  Make sure you visit there.
[03:57:41.042 --> 03:57:41.883]  Check out the store.
[03:57:42.785 --> 03:57:44.347]  Subscribe to the newsletter.
[03:57:44.968 --> 03:57:45.409]  Go there.
[03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:47.312]  Bookmark the site if you haven't already.
[03:57:47.352 --> 03:57:48.655]  Support InfoWars.
[03:57:49.436 --> 03:57:49.817]  Absolutely.
[03:57:52.822 --> 03:57:56.445]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[03:57:57.345 --> 03:58:02.649]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:58:03.250 --> 03:58:04.811]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[03:58:05.691 --> 03:58:11.375]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[03:58:12.336 --> 03:58:21.746]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[03:58:22.507 --> 03:58:23.048]  It's that simple.
[03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:24.610]  So, it's epic.
[03:58:24.690 --> 03:58:25.310]  It's amazing.
[03:58:25.551 --> 03:58:27.052]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[03:58:27.613 --> 03:58:30.056]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[03:58:31.657 --> 03:58:32.798]  This is the stuff of legends.
[03:58:33.238 --> 03:58:36.720]  And I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[03:58:37.321 --> 03:58:39.642]  You are not just part of the info war.
[03:58:40.223 --> 03:58:40.863]  You're the core.
[03:58:40.903 --> 03:58:41.463]  You're the heart.
[03:58:41.563 --> 03:58:42.184]  You're everything.
[03:58:42.204 --> 03:58:59.575]  And it's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own... whatever it is.
