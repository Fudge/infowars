[00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:13.908]  You found it.
[00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.750]  The tip of the spear.
[00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:19.014]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:25.422]  Welcome on this December the 23rd 2018 I'm David Knight your host.
[00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.014]  Well, we've had some updates to the big stories that started hitting at the end of the week.
[00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.917]  And of course, it's at this time of year that a lot of very important things can happen.
[00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:43.861]  You know, it was 105 years ago on Friday, as I covered on Friday, that the Federal Reserve was created.
[00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:51.025]  And now we have President Trump saying many reports that he wanted to fire the chair of the Fed.
[00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:59.121]  Now you've got Steve Mnuchin, the Goldman Sachs banker, who's his Treasury Secretary, coming back and saying, no, no, no, he didn't say anything like that.
[00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.142]  No, no, no, we respect the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:02.862]  They cannot be touched.
[00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:03.583]  Well, they can.
[00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:04.963]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:11.145]  President Trump is getting into some very important areas here.
[00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:17.807]  When he starts to do things like bring the troops home from an unconstitutional war that we should not be involved in,
[00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:28.723]  When he starts talking about the actions of the Fed, and criticizing the Fed, and talking about changing the Fed, it's starting to look a lot like JFK, isn't it?
[00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:38.291]  Maybe that's why President Trump is also talking about the fact that we've got an armed citizenry, and if they take him out, coup or otherwise, there will be a pushback against what they're doing.
[00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.733]  He certainly understands that he's in dangerous territory.
[00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:48.097]  And we're going to talk about why he should move against the Fed, should not wait, how he might do it.
[00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:55.207]  As a matter of fact, this is something that goes back to the very beginning of the Trump presidency, right after he was elected.
[00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.570]  It was the middle of December then.
[00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:02.730]  That you had then-chair Janet Yellen increase interest rates.
[00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.195]  Now, the entire Obama administration, they had only increased interest rates slightly and done it once.
[00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:11.716]  One interest rate.
[00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:13.457]  The entire eight years of Obama.
[00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:22.103]  And then, right after President Trump was elected, about six weeks later, they raised interest rates a quarter.
[00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:27.833]  And I said at the time, and I said it for the entire week, I said they're going to do the same thing that Greenspan did.
[00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:38.339]  Greenspan, of course, you remember, he created the real estate and stock market bubble with the Federal Reserve by lowering interest rates and keeping them at essentially zero for a very long period of time.
[00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.942]  And then he began raising interest rates one quarter of a percent every calendar quarter.
[00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:49.345]  It looks, if you look at the chart of Fed rates, it looks like a little stair step case going straight up.
[00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:53.574]  And then if that wasn't enough, he started talking about irrational exuberance.
[00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:57.255]  And of course, he had some comments this last week talking about run for the exits.
[00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:01.137]  So they do everything they can to manipulate, to undermine this economy.
[00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:04.378]  And of course, that has been the design of the Federal Reserve since its creation.
[00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:06.438]  It was designed to do that.
[00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.059]  So I ran the report that I did.
[00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.921]  It was 100 years, 100 year anniversary of the creation of the Federal Reserve on a December the 21st.
[00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:17.160]  That's back in 1913.
[00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:19.223]  So I did the report five years ago.
[00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:20.726]  It's now 105 years old.
[00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:26.375]  I tied it to the movie that came out 33 years later on December the 20th, It's a Wonderful Life.
[00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.999]  We'll play that clip for you later in the broadcast.
[00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.900]  But you can see how they engineered bank runs.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.100]  They did everything that they could.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.781]  They conspired with foreign bankers.
[00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:39.142]  The same kind of foreign bankers who were putting the Bolsheviks in power in Germany.
[00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:42.163]  Warburg, Max Warburg in Germany.
[00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:45.744]  And then his brother, Paul Warburg, was working with J.P.
[00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:48.925]  Morgan, who is the classic.
[00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:53.907]  Whether they were trying to imitate this guy or if it was just subconscious, who knows?
[00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:55.387]  But clearly J.P.
[00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:56.988]  Morgan was the very imbibement
[00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.639]  of a monopolistic, too-rich-for-everyone's-own-good banker.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.704]  He's the caricature that you see on Monopoly money.
[00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:10.646]  And so, along with J.P.
[00:04:10.686 --> 00:04:15.730]  Morgan, who is very much like the character Potter in the movie, they engineered the Federal Reserve.
[00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.692]  They did it on a Christmas, when nobody was really paying any attention.
[00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:27.779]  Now we've had Mitch McConnell show his true colors by saying, I'm not going to really do anything to try to get this to pass in the Senate.
[00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.462]  It did pass in the House, thanks to the efforts of the House Freedom Caucus.
[00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:34.604]  They firmed up President Trump on it.
[00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:35.344]  They got it passed.
[00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:39.165]  And then Mitch McConnell said, we're not going to use the simple majority rule.
[00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:40.146]  We're going to pretend.
[00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.286]  I'm not going to go with the nuclear option.
[00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.327]  It's a simple majority rule.
[00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:47.028]  You want to pretend that you don't have that authority?
[00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:47.589]  And he did.
[00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.889]  And so he shut the government down.
[00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:52.370]  But folks, the Democrats are stonewalling.
[00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:55.912]  And they're stonewalling for an open border.
[00:04:55.952 --> 00:05:00.313]  They will do anything to avoid putting that little bit of money to protect the border.
[00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:01.094]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:01.554]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:04.858]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:06.559]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.200]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.741]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:14.925]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:18.788]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:27.434]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:37.738]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.321]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:48.283]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:51.165]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:52.605]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:55.907]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:02.636]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:09.563]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:32.827]  I've been on the air 24 years, but I've never covered a grouping of stories that together signify the biggest change, not just to United States policy, but to the entire direction of the world.
[00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:40.573]  This constellation of developments has the political establishment, the corrupt globalists, shaking to their core.
[00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:53.473]  But the underlying theme here is extreme change for the better, but also with an extreme danger to our 45th president, Donald John Trump.
[00:06:55.134 --> 00:06:59.758]  Now, I'm going to cover some of the latest developments with the president, and then I'm going to hit the big story.
[00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:08.446]  And that, of course, is the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve established 104 years ago secretly at Jekyll Island, Georgia.
[00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:17.266]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump has openly signaled that he's ready to fire the private head of the Federal Reserve and even reorganize it.
[00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:25.671]  Mainstream corporate media has said that he doesn't have the power to do it, but I have the Federal Reserve Act in front of me, and I'm going to read to you from it.
[00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:36.158]  But obviously, if he appoints the head of the Fed, he can remove the head of the Fed, and we the people can abolish this fraudulent organization.
[00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:45.834]  But remember, the last president that tried to abolish the Federal Reserve got riddled with bullets in Dallas, Texas, Dealey Plaza.
[00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:48.817]  So let's run through why the establishment's so scared.
[00:07:50.298 --> 00:07:54.682]  Trump ran on removing troops from our longest war, Afghanistan, and against the Syrian war.
[00:07:55.322 --> 00:08:00.067]  Now we've basically ended the conflict there that Obama helped start, and the troops are being pulled out.
[00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:08.187]  Both political parties are now against him and the left have now become rabid pro-war zealots foaming at the mouth.
[00:08:08.247 --> 00:08:11.573]  The same people who used to show us death counts daily under the Bush era.
[00:08:12.615 --> 00:08:13.136]  Continuing.
[00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:16.854]  We have the bad trade deals being reversed.
[00:08:17.454 --> 00:08:18.954]  Millions of new jobs.
[00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:22.495]  The stock market had more than doubled until they sabotaged it.
[00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:35.898]  We've seen criminal justice reform, where Hillary Clinton helped get laws passed with Bill tripling sentences for black people over white people, and saying blacks are super predators that need to be brought to heel like dogs.
[00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:39.999]  Now that that's been signed and passed, the President's getting no credit for it.
[00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.079]  He truly is.
[00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:44.327]  The Liberator, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:46.047]  Sovereignty's back.
[00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:49.169]  Territorial integrity is back.
[00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:55.471]  He pulled us out of unelected globalist trade deals that circumvented Congress, the presidency, and the people, like TPP.
[00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:58.392]  The list goes on and on.
[00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:07.556]  But now let's move to why Trump is for real and why he's in grave danger.
[00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:09.637]  President Trump
[00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.032]  He's moving against the private Federal Reserve.
[00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:20.377]  Hasn't been audited in 104 years, but when it was founded, it was confirmed that over 80% of it was basically European owned.
[00:09:21.758 --> 00:09:32.327]  So a private banking consortium has hoodwinked the public and the world into believing that it's above the law and no one can audit it and no one can question what it does.
[00:09:33.677 --> 00:09:42.325]  Well, the other three branches of government are questionable and audible, but it's not even a branch of government, like Federal Ammunition or Federal Express.
[00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:42.886]  It's private.
[00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:45.708]  And this is now all admitted and confirmed.
[00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:52.515]  A hundred years ago it was known, but over time they brainwashed the public where the public didn't even understand this.
[00:09:52.815 --> 00:09:54.617]  Now, because we've exposed it,
[00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:57.825]  We can have a real debate about it.
[00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:22.780]  But first, let's go to a short minute clip of Alan Greenspan, 10 years ago, during the subprime crisis that the private banks had engineered to consolidate control and get trillions in bailouts for themselves, telling Laird NewsHour that Congress and the President and everyone else cannot even question or say anything, that the Federal Reserve is like God.
[00:10:24.218 --> 00:10:32.002]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:47.331]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:10:48.750 --> 00:11:07.034]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:10.855]  And I've had very good relationships with presidents.
[00:11:12.075 --> 00:11:14.716]  Now, I'm doing my best here to be calm.
[00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:27.130]  But did you just hear the giant con game, the giant Jedi mind trick that the former head of the Federal Reserve just put out there?
[00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:32.673]  That no one can question them, no one can investigate them, no one can look into them.
[00:11:34.334 --> 00:11:42.799]  They are completely above everything, not just above the law, but above investigation, above scrutiny.
[00:11:43.962 --> 00:11:46.203]  No one is above the law.
[00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:56.325]  Now, let's look at the facts, because CNN, MSNBC are saying Trump isn't allowed to even talk about firing the head of the private Federal Reserve.
[00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:57.785]  But he is!
[00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:00.946]  It's in the Federal Reserve Act that I'll read to you in a moment.
[00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:04.987]  But first, Trump was right during the campaign.
[00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:10.688]  And he was right, again, just a few months ago, in the second campaign, in the midterms.
[00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:22.206]  He said, if you want to plunge the stock market, if you want the regulations back, if you want to kill the recovery, elect the Democrats, because that will signal that they're going to be able to overturn this revolution.
[00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:27.108]  But he went on to say, the Federal Reserve better not raise interest rates anymore.
[00:12:27.128 --> 00:12:28.509]  They've already raised it seven times.
[00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:30.309]  Never did that under Obama.
[00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.631]  He said, if they do that, it'll tank our economy.
[00:12:34.807 --> 00:12:43.013]  The Federal Reserve is part of the OECD and the Ex-Im Bank, big international consortiums that basically rig interest rates around the world and other things.
[00:12:44.594 --> 00:12:52.360]  It's a monopoly over currency, just like OPEC's monopoly over oil and other petrochemicals and derivatives.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.941]  And OPEC
[00:12:56.161 --> 00:13:01.625]  Has also, at many levels, been working with the same private Federal Reserve multinational consortium.
[00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:06.368]  And these groups have agreed to let China have 10% growth rates forever.
[00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:09.671]  And, it gets worse, 0% interest rates.
[00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:12.013]  So just remember why Trump is so angry.
[00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:16.216]  We get higher interest rates, China gets zero.
[00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:20.539]  All of this is to make China the place to invest.
[00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:23.201]  So here's this group that thinks it's above the law.
[00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.511]  Dictating to you what they're going to do.
[00:13:27.091 --> 00:13:29.912]  They've not been audited or investigated over 104 years.
[00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:31.533]  Here's an article out of Forbes.
[00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:37.075]  How Trump could fire Powell and rebuild the Fed.
[00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:40.316]  And then it says right here, from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.
[00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:51.621]  Thereafter, each member shall hold office for a term of 14 years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed by cause for the president.
[00:13:53.241 --> 00:13:53.842]  So read that again.
[00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:59.153]  Unless sooner removed for cause by the president.
[00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:03.876]  And the president decides with his executive power the cause.
[00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:09.099]  Back when Obama was president, oh, the left loved all the powers of the presidency.
[00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:17.003]  But now that Trump's in there, they claim that he can't even trim his toenails without permission from the bureaucracy.
[00:14:18.203 --> 00:14:22.706]  They're saying it was some reckless move to pull out of Syria and to pull out of Afghanistan when he ran on that.
[00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:33.373]  The truth is, you have a political consortium that follows a global plan, and presidents have just become ceremonial, and now Trump is no longer being ceremonial.
[00:14:34.053 --> 00:14:35.195]  He is being the president.
[00:14:35.555 --> 00:14:39.540]  And whether you agree with him or disagree with him, this is how the Constitution works.
[00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:41.323]  This is how this country is supposed to operate.
[00:14:41.603 --> 00:14:49.714]  And that's why the people that have stolen and usurped our country's destiny are so unhappy because Trump is wresting the wheel of state away from them.
[00:14:50.695 --> 00:14:51.456]  These are the facts.
[00:14:51.996 --> 00:15:00.103]  Now David Knight's hosting live today so I'll take you back live to David Knight in studio hosting the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:15:00.443 --> 00:15:06.007]  every Sunday and then David comes back of course with his own program 8 a.m.
[00:15:06.227 --> 00:15:06.988]  Central every
[00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:10.636]  We're good to go.
[00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:39.367]  All right, that's Alex Jones, and I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking more about what's going on with the Federal Reserve coming up.
[00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:42.669]  We're also going to talk about what's going on with the breaking news.
[00:15:42.729 --> 00:15:45.990]  President Trump said to General Mattis that you can't quit, I'm firing you.
[00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:49.372]  Effective January the 1st, you're out of here.
[00:15:49.392 --> 00:15:52.253]  And we're going to tell you about this other guy who walked out.
[00:15:52.894 --> 00:15:54.094]  Very interesting, I think you'll find.
[00:15:54.114 --> 00:15:55.155]  When we come back, stay with us.
[00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:11.178]  I almost have to just sit back and take a moment of silence to think about how far we've come against the globalists.
[00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.960]  Ten years ago, you talk about a private Federal Reserve.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.560]  People laughed at you.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.500]  Now everybody knows it's private.
[00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:21.444]  Ten years ago, you talk about a private one-world government with a plan for global carbon tax and a plan to break up the family.
[00:16:21.504 --> 00:16:22.965]  People told you you were crazy.
[00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:29.728]  But as 2018 prepares to unleash its mortal coil and give birth to 2019,
[00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:32.816]  We've been proven right.
[00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:44.558]  That's why we're branded as fake news, that's why we're branded as Nazis, and all this made-up crazy crap by the horrible, deceptive corporate media that's sold out to all these multinational interests, like the Chai Koms and others.
[00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:49.959]  So, I just want to make the statement again that humanity is awakening, thanks to God and all of your action.
[00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:56.680]  We are moving the ball down the field against the globalists, and now, more than ever, people have to realize that we're entering the event horizon.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.701]  We've already passed the point of no return, and it's now up to you, InfoWars.
[00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.002]  Is in your hands.
[00:17:02.863 --> 00:17:06.586]  And InfoWars has been targeted because we are successful and we tell the truth.
[00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.768]  And they want to take us down to get at you.
[00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.251]  So just as I am in your hands, you are in our hands.
[00:17:13.012 --> 00:17:14.634]  We have a shared destiny.
[00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:15.995]  And everyone knows it.
[00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:16.656]  They can feel it.
[00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:17.616]  They can smell it.
[00:17:18.356 --> 00:17:19.558]  And they're coming from everybody.
[00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:27.308]  Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, and myself, and Owen Schroer, and Matt Drudge, and everybody.
[00:17:27.328 --> 00:17:29.752]  They're trying to take everybody, Gavin McGinnis, off the air right now.
[00:17:30.432 --> 00:17:33.256]  But none of those guys were ever able to build their own platform except for Drudge.
[00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:40.497]  That's why you've got to support the InfoWars platform, because this model would mean the death to the globalist program of people being independent.
[00:17:40.757 --> 00:17:45.799]  InfoWars is the renaissance model, not the conquest model, and it's you that funds it and supports it.
[00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:49.700]  So, I spread the word, praying for us, and financially supporting us getting great products.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.821]  InfoWarsStore.com, you make it all possible.
[00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:56.543]  And we have the best deals ever until the end of the year at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:56.783 --> 00:17:57.243]  Thank you all.
[00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:11.717]  Many of you watching or listening have either been completely banned off social media or you have been censored.
[00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:21.523]  And we've seen thousands of prominent voices banned off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Instagram in the last two years.
[00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:28.487]  It all started the day after Hillary Clinton, who outspent Donald Trump 10 to 1 in the 2016 election.
[00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:41.933]  America was supposed to be all sewed up for the culture war, with the deindustrialization, the demoralization, but it didn't happen the way they'd planned it.
[00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:53.957]  And so now they've announced Michael Savage, 20-something years on air, number one in his slot nationwide, is having his show canceled and replaced with Ben Shapiro, who's never even had a talk show on the radio.
[00:18:55.778 --> 00:18:57.919]  Now we see they're trying to take Tucker Carlson off the air.
[00:18:58.823 --> 00:19:02.645]  Now we see Gavin McGinnis, number one on CRTV, taken down.
[00:19:03.366 --> 00:19:10.329]  Whoever's number one on their platform is taken down, because that's who the globalists fear is leaders.
[00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:21.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's national campaigns out there to not even let other people post this to YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook, where even our fans can't counter what's happening.
[00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:26.527]  Look, there's one thing they haven't figured out how to censor yet, and that's hashtags.
[00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:33.433]  Whether it's Twitter, whether it's Instagram, whether it's Facebook, whether it's YouTube, it leads people back to feeds of information.
[00:19:34.372 --> 00:19:36.633]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:19:37.573 --> 00:19:51.239]  If all of you, when you make a tweet, or send it on Instagram, or even talk to your neighbors, or call in to talk radio, just tell people the way to get around the censorship and break the back of the system is hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:19:51.939 --> 00:19:56.200]  If everybody starts doing that, it's going to be the shot heard around the world.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.902]  So whatever you do, start today with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:10.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.952 --> 00:20:16.776]  When the war was over, there were jobs galore.
[00:20:17.877 --> 00:20:18.718]  For the G.I.
[00:20:18.758 --> 00:20:21.541]  Josephs who were in the war.
[00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:25.626]  But for generals, things were not so grand.
[00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:31.654]  And it's not so hard to understand.
[00:20:34.456 --> 00:20:39.580]  What can you do with a general when he stops being a general?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.823]  Oh, what can you do with a general who retired?
[00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:45.544]  Or maybe he was fired.
[00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:49.587]  We're trying to figure out whether this retired was fired, right?
[00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.530]  And this is at Washington Ablaze.
[00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.731]  Go ahead and take that down.
[00:20:53.751 --> 00:20:54.991]  Of course, that's from White Christmas.
[00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:56.713]  That movie, you may remember.
[00:20:57.827 --> 00:20:59.128]  Was about global warming.
[00:20:59.528 --> 00:21:00.048]  That's right!
[00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:04.991]  Maybe, you know, Mattis can retire and buy an inn in Vermont or something.
[00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:06.972]  But then of course, you know, we have that global warming.
[00:21:07.012 --> 00:21:08.513]  But then that was happening back then.
[00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:14.357]  They weren't silly enough back in the days of Irving Berlin to blame weather on mankind.
[00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:15.637]  But we are today.
[00:21:16.498 --> 00:21:21.481]  And so that whole movie, as you remember, was about a snow drought that they were having up there.
[00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:22.682]  And they organized a
[00:21:24.302 --> 00:21:25.283]  A charity event.
[00:21:26.263 --> 00:21:27.724]  Trying to get everybody to support the general.
[00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:34.286]  Who apparently doesn't have the kind of golden parachute pension plans that modern day generals do.
[00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:36.026]  Those generals are real generals.
[00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:39.468]  These guys are politicians and they are lifetime bureaucrats.
[00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:41.288]  They have a massive pension.
[00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:43.129]  But of course you can always have more, right?
[00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:45.250]  Just like Rockefeller said.
[00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.030]  It's always a little bit more.
[00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.551]  You never kind of get enough.
[00:21:49.231 --> 00:21:51.252]  But when we look at what happened
[00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:57.454]  Over the weekend, I talked about James Mattis, his manifesto.
[00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:59.396]  They call it a resignation letter.
[00:21:59.576 --> 00:22:01.117]  I call it a globalist manifesto.
[00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:04.160]  And I'll tell you why in just a moment.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:12.686]  But President Trump had enough, and so he tweeted out today that he's got somebody that's going to be starting effective January the 1st.
[00:22:12.807 --> 00:22:17.710]  In other words, he's not going to wait for the 60 to 90 days that Mattis said he was going to hang around.
[00:22:18.231 --> 00:22:20.693]  To make sure, of course, that we had an adult in the room.
[00:22:22.327 --> 00:22:35.910]  And as one of the reports, Mattis said, this is a guy, when you look at the fact that they called him Mad Dog Mattis, and he bragged about how he wanted to have a plan to kill everybody in the room.
[00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:37.831]  He's the adult in the room.
[00:22:40.011 --> 00:22:42.472]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:44.372]  Pretty amazing what we have here.
[00:22:44.592 --> 00:22:46.773]  And of course, if we go back and look at his resignation letter,
[00:22:48.444 --> 00:22:56.407]  He's saying things like his core belief is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our system of alliances and partnerships.
[00:22:56.447 --> 00:22:57.027]  Well, you know what?
[00:22:57.807 --> 00:23:00.968]  That is exactly the opposite of what America is about.
[00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:11.472]  It is enough to make the founders of America spend in their graves, Washington said in his farewell address, to avoid entangling alliances for this very reason.
[00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:15.653]  And yet he thinks that's our core strength.
[00:23:17.805 --> 00:23:22.890]  And he goes on to say that we have to do everything possible to advance an international order.
[00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.472]  No, that is not your job.
[00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:37.285]  All of these people who say that they can't spend a little tiny sliver of the budget to defend our country are adamant that we have to defend these alliances.
[00:23:38.581 --> 00:23:44.146]  Because, see, their loyalty is to these international alliances and to the military-industrial complex, not to America.
[00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:46.568]  That's the bottom line, folks, that you need to understand.
[00:23:47.189 --> 00:23:51.533]  It's great that President Trump is finally moving against these people.
[00:23:53.584 --> 00:24:02.332]  One individual, Matt Purple, said, and the American conservative said, Vladimir Putin is being given credit for all this stuff.
[00:24:03.072 --> 00:24:04.894]  No, it's actually President Trump.
[00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:13.321]  One headline said somehow he got a double shot of political Viagra and realized that he's got a lot of power that he can use.
[00:24:13.622 --> 00:24:17.125]  And he's going straight at the centers of power.
[00:24:17.585 --> 00:24:19.167]  But as Matt Purple said,
[00:24:20.267 --> 00:24:21.888]  Vladimir Putin must be a wily one.
[00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:24.710]  Think about all that he's managed to accomplish over the last 24 hours.
[00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:31.955]  According to the geopolitical wizards on Twitter, at Putin's behest, President Trump on Wednesday announced the withdrawal of American troops from Syria.
[00:24:32.918 --> 00:24:45.407]  That's now cleared the path for Russia to exert control over Damascus, the Middle East, indeed the world itself, because Moscow has at last secured the jewel in its neo-conservative, I should say, neo-Soviet empire.
[00:24:45.427 --> 00:24:47.108]  We're the ones with the neo-conservative empire.
[00:24:47.548 --> 00:24:50.770]  A strip of chaotic desert in northeast Syria.
[00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:54.393]  Yeah, it's pretty silly when we look at this.
[00:24:54.433 --> 00:25:01.838]  And of course, Rand Paul pointed out that we have these armchair generals and, you know, what are we going to do with them?
[00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:05.964]  We should show them the door just like President Trump did.
[00:25:06.425 --> 00:25:10.995]  But Rand Paul said this about the armchair generals who want to keep us at war forever.
[00:25:11.055 --> 00:25:11.917]  Video clip for.
[00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:14.106]  It was never the mission.
[00:25:14.126 --> 00:25:17.008]  The mission was to wipe out ISIS, and we did succeed.
[00:25:17.308 --> 00:25:20.689]  And the thing is, it's incredibly bold to win a war and come home.
[00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:22.250]  That's what the people want.
[00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:30.713]  If you poll the American people, it's 60-70% of people are ready to get out of Afghanistan, and I'll bet you the same is Syria if you ask the people.
[00:25:31.093 --> 00:25:35.775]  It's only the people in Washington, the armchair generals, that want to keep us at war forever.
[00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:37.998]  And people, Americans are tired of it.
[00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:39.299]  We want that money here at home.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.546]  And we want to create jobs, roads, bridges here at home, not in Afghanistan.
[00:25:45.247 --> 00:25:46.048]  That's absolutely right.
[00:25:46.088 --> 00:25:50.795]  And so President Trump tweeted out this afternoon that starting January the 1st, Mattis is going to be gone.
[00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:58.520]  We don't need somebody whose loyalty is to an international system of alliances and not to the American people.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.363]  He goes on to say in his resignation letter, Mattis said, the U.S., I agree with you, as I've said from the beginning, the armed forces of the U.S.
[00:26:07.563 --> 00:26:09.384]  should not be the policemen of the world.
[00:26:10.364 --> 00:26:13.605]  And then he goes on to talk about NATO and its 29 democracies.
[00:26:14.046 --> 00:26:14.506]  Wait a minute.
[00:26:15.726 --> 00:26:20.148]  Who provides virtually all of NATO's troops, equipment and funding?
[00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:20.568]  That would be
[00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:23.616]  The policeman of the world, the U.S.
[00:26:24.136 --> 00:26:30.761]  And then he talked about the defeat ISIS coalition of 74 nations, which, frankly, I wasn't aware that it even existed.
[00:26:31.842 --> 00:26:38.187]  But there was a bureaucrat who was making a lot of money out of that coalition and his job there.
[00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:41.509]  And he also came out against President Trump.
[00:26:41.569 --> 00:26:43.490]  That's McGurk.
[00:26:45.092 --> 00:26:50.636]  And Brett McGurk was the envoy to that coalition, that very effective coalition.
[00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:53.189]  And he abruptly resigned.
[00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:54.730]  You know, 74 nations, who knew?
[00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:55.990]  I didn't know anything about that.
[00:26:56.711 --> 00:27:04.713]  But he was also, interestingly enough, the guy who made the announcement that really ticked me and a lot of people off.
[00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:08.335]  And I talked about it and I said, is this really what the Trump administration is about?
[00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:09.295]  Well, fortunately it isn't.
[00:27:10.175 --> 00:27:18.278]  But he got up there and said, we have determined that we are going to be in Syria for an indeterminate amount of time.
[00:27:19.172 --> 00:27:20.413]  And I said, are you kidding me?
[00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:22.114]  We're going to have another forever war?
[00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:35.863]  You'd had the mainstream media, like the Washington Post and the New York Times, releasing the week before that we had troops that controlled one-third of Syria, an area about the size of Louisiana, that they were going to stay there, he said.
[00:27:35.903 --> 00:27:40.086]  He holds a press conference, Brett McGurk, and said, we're going to be there indefinitely.
[00:27:41.687 --> 00:27:44.689]  And President Trump had something to say about that.
[00:27:45.945 --> 00:28:00.293]  And if we go back and we look at how this all began, going back to the Daily Caller, said if we go back a couple of weeks, December the 14th, there was a phone call between President Trump and the Turkish President Erdogan.
[00:28:01.493 --> 00:28:06.116]  And you had John Bolton standing, sitting there in the White House.
[00:28:07.216 --> 00:28:13.980]  And so it's supposed to be a call for President Trump to warn Erdogan to back off.
[00:28:15.148 --> 00:28:16.430]  Back off our Kurdish rebels.
[00:28:17.492 --> 00:28:22.560]  But the president of Turkey asked Trump, why are you even still in Syria?
[00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:24.023]  You've got a third of the country there.
[00:28:24.043 --> 00:28:24.764]  Why are you even there?
[00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.188]  ISIS has been 99% defeated.
[00:28:29.454 --> 00:28:43.056]  And then President Trump went off script, and he asked Bolton, according to NBC News, with Erdogan on the line, Trump asked National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was listening in, why American troops remained in Syria, if what the President of Turkey said was true.
[00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:49.638]  According to officials, Erdogan's point, Bolton was forced to admit, and had been backed up by Mattis, Pompeo, U.S.
[00:28:49.658 --> 00:28:52.858]  Special Envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffery, and Brett McCurk.
[00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:54.058]  They all said, yeah, they've only got 1%.
[00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.619]  In other words, they've been beaten.
[00:28:57.645 --> 00:28:58.245]  They've been beaten.
[00:28:59.045 --> 00:29:01.206]  And Russia has almost completely stopped its flights.
[00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:01.866]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:02.286]  Stay with us.
[00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:05.607]  Infowars has changed the world.
[00:29:06.647 --> 00:29:09.668]  Our audience, by supporting us, have truly been in the arena.
[00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.409]  That means if you're old, it means if you're young, it means if you're black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:26.432]  If you love freedom and you love justice and you believe in free market capitalism and you believe in the Christian ethos, you believe in Western civilization and you believe in progress, then you are the man and woman in the arena and I salute you
[00:29:26.972 --> 00:29:42.161]  As we prepare to close out 2018, I knew that when they deplatformed us in a massive, draconian, concerted, racketeering operation four and a half months ago, that it was about removing Trump's populist, nationalist support base.
[00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:44.122]  The people's support base for him.
[00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:52.413]  And now we see, in just the last few weeks, Michael Savage is having his show cancelled from three hours to one hour, even though it has record ratings.
[00:29:52.813 --> 00:29:56.954]  And Ben Shapiro, never been on talk radio, is being given his show, given his audience.
[00:29:57.894 --> 00:30:03.075]  We see Gab McGinnis being taken off the air for being number one on CRTV, better than Glenn Beck, and others.
[00:30:03.815 --> 00:30:13.978]  Anyone who truly connects with the people, and who doesn't apologize for America, from our president to yours truly, is being demonized, being sued, being attacked, being taken off the air.
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:21.178]  The globalists are really upset now because they threw everything they had at us in the last few years.
[00:30:21.798 --> 00:30:26.760]  The shadow banning and the lawsuits, the lies, the attacks, the boycotting of our sponsors, and it didn't work.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.843]  So now with the de-platforming, we're on talk radio, we're on local TV stations, and we're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com with bigger than ever audiences.
[00:30:37.122 --> 00:30:37.923]  On those platforms.
[00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:42.626]  InfoWars has two or three times the audience ever had, but that's on InfoWars.
[00:30:43.187 --> 00:30:45.508]  It cuts our reach, though, to other platforms.
[00:30:46.249 --> 00:30:47.230]  And that's where you come in.
[00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:55.776]  Now, about two weeks ago, George Soros Media Matters funded Combine, erected by U.S.
[00:30:55.856 --> 00:30:58.138]  intelligence agencies that aren't following Trump's directives.
[00:30:59.864 --> 00:31:10.172]  He legally began launching operations to lie about Infowars and things we've said and done, and to contact radio stations across the country that we're on and say, Alex Jones is fake news.
[00:31:11.113 --> 00:31:12.174]  Alex Jones is fiction.
[00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:13.815]  Announce it's fiction.
[00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:17.838]  In an attempt to have those stations kick us off the air.
[00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:24.504]  And they misquote statements from 2013, 2015 and say, he's still doing all this, take him off the air.
[00:31:25.762 --> 00:31:29.424]  We're talking about digital Nazis, or digital communists.
[00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:33.347]  Digital authoritarianism is really the proper term.
[00:31:34.028 --> 00:31:36.429]  And they're doing this because they can't beat us.
[00:31:36.869 --> 00:31:47.617]  And they know from Brazil, to Germany, to the United Kingdom, to Russia, to Italy, to all over the world, nationalist and populist free market candidates are getting elected.
[00:31:48.357 --> 00:31:54.221]  People are aware of the one world government plan to abolish our borders, to abolish our families, to make us debt slaves.
[00:31:54.261 --> 00:31:54.981]  And they're saying no.
[00:31:55.963 --> 00:31:56.624]  That's positive.
[00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:57.948]  We're winning overall globally.
[00:31:58.188 --> 00:31:59.472]  Humanity's coming back from the dead.
[00:31:59.572 --> 00:32:02.359]  But, for those of us that...
[00:32:03.263 --> 00:32:06.585]  Or the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:32:06.665 --> 00:32:07.886]  That's the globalist only hope.
[00:32:08.607 --> 00:32:27.820]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech, and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future, and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[00:32:29.209 --> 00:32:34.954]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:40.499]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:43.181]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[00:32:43.601 --> 00:32:44.662]  Every order gets free shipping.
[00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:47.545]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[00:32:47.925 --> 00:32:56.613]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[00:32:57.273 --> 00:32:58.974]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:32:59.254 --> 00:33:00.034]  I salute you all.
[00:33:00.194 --> 00:33:02.655]  Now please take action at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:05.937 --> 00:33:12.119]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:23.324]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.804 --> 00:33:26.625]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:33:30.492 --> 00:33:30.912]  Welcome back.
[00:33:30.932 --> 00:33:43.878]  You know, one of the things that amazes me is how many conservatives are, and people I would typically not think about being neocons, maybe I have to rethink that, are siding with Mattis.
[00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:53.363]  And as Daily Caller pointed out, it was a conference call going back to December the 14th, where President Trump was talking to the President of Turkey.
[00:33:54.102 --> 00:33:57.524]  And he was supposed to be telling him to back off for the neocons.
[00:33:57.564 --> 00:34:01.346]  Instead, as they were talking, Erdogan said, why are you still there?
[00:34:03.046 --> 00:34:06.028]  ISIS is down to just 1% of what it was before.
[00:34:06.368 --> 00:34:07.509]  They're 99% gone.
[00:34:07.929 --> 00:34:10.390]  And President Trump turned to John Bolton and said, is that true?
[00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:12.851]  And he said, uh, yeah.
[00:34:14.112 --> 00:34:17.053]  And as I've reported in the morning show,
[00:34:18.732 --> 00:34:22.514]  That we have here begins at 9 a.m.
[00:34:22.634 --> 00:34:24.475]  Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.
[00:34:25.175 --> 00:34:28.017]  As I was talking about it, Russia had cut down their flights by 99%.
[00:34:29.217 --> 00:34:29.838]  Weeks ago!
[00:34:30.778 --> 00:34:34.800]  They had been running between 100 and 110 flights a day.
[00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:38.082]  Between 100 to 110 flights per day.
[00:34:38.822 --> 00:34:41.504]  And they cut it down to 1 to 2 flights per week.
[00:34:42.284 --> 00:34:43.424]  That's way more than 99%.
[00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:49.102]  So I think Erdogan was being conservative when he said that.
[00:34:49.663 --> 00:34:53.064]  And so President Trump turned to Bolton and said, is that true?
[00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.545]  And said, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:57.326]  Mattis knows it.
[00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.546]  Pompeo knows it.
[00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:01.387]  Brett McGurk, this other guy who just quit, knows it.
[00:35:01.948 --> 00:35:08.170]  And so they spent the following week unsuccessfully trying to turn Trump around.
[00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.472]  As a matter of fact, this other guy who resigned, Brett McGurk,
[00:35:13.499 --> 00:35:18.625]  Was the one who had the press conference and said, we're going to be there for an indefinite period of time.
[00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:28.255]  And that was, I think, an effort to intimidate President Trump, to make him look bad in case President Trump went ahead with that policy.
[00:35:29.095 --> 00:35:32.278]  This is the way the deep state establishment protects itself.
[00:35:32.518 --> 00:35:39.164]  They hold press conferences, just like you've seen Rosenstein holding a press conference as President Trump is going off to meet the President of Russia.
[00:35:39.745 --> 00:35:41.146]  So we don't want to have detente.
[00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:42.767]  Remember, detente used to be a good thing.
[00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.729]  Detente used to be the easing of strained relations.
[00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:47.411]  Now they want to do everything they can to strain relations.
[00:35:48.092 --> 00:35:51.658]  If that means that they can attack President Trump or try to make him look bad.
[00:35:52.038 --> 00:35:57.447]  And so that's what Rosenstein did with his phony indictments that he released as President Trump was flying to a summit meeting.
[00:35:58.409 --> 00:35:59.951]  And so that's, I think, what Brett McCurk did.
[00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:01.794]  Now, Stephen Miller got on Thursday night
[00:36:02.762 --> 00:36:08.690]  And he had this to say, one foreign policy blunder after another in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has not worked out for our national interest.
[00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.811]  And let's talk about Syria.
[00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:13.716]  Let's talk about the fact that ISIS is the enemy of Russia.
[00:36:14.217 --> 00:36:16.620]  ISIS is the enemy of Assad in Syria.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.742]  ISIS is the enemy of Turkey.
[00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:24.347]  Are we supposed to stay in Syria for generation after generation, spilling American blood to fight the enemies of all those countries?
[00:36:25.028 --> 00:36:35.477]  Wolf, and he's talking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN, when did the American people sign up to be in every war and every place and every side of every conflict all over planet Earth?
[00:36:36.718 --> 00:36:48.027]  Well, I guess that goes back to General Mattis' retirement things, as our strength as a nation is linked to our systems of alliances and partnerships, where we have foreign entangling alliances that get us involved in every single conflict.
[00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:58.576]  Now, you think about the fact, as he pointed out, that Russia and Turkey and Syria are all fighting ISIS, but we've got to stay there, even though they're 99% defeated.
[00:36:59.977 --> 00:37:02.979]  And then, of course, the mission creep
[00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.348]  Became that this was about Iran.
[00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:10.210]  And yet, Iran is the enemy of Israel, the enemy of Saudi Arabia, for certain.
[00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:17.672]  And if you go into this, of course, there are going to be enemies with Turkey as well, because Turkey doesn't subscribe to the same brand of Islam that they have.
[00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:19.953]  So all these people are going to be fighting Iran as well.
[00:37:21.694 --> 00:37:24.715]  President Reagan was right when he pulled us out of Beirut after that bombing.
[00:37:24.755 --> 00:37:25.915]  He said, this place is crazy.
[00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:27.815]  They've always been fighting each other.
[00:37:27.835 --> 00:37:29.076]  They're going to continue to fight each other.
[00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:29.876]  We don't need to be here.
[00:37:30.656 --> 00:37:32.257]  Except that you have people like Hillary Clinton.
[00:37:33.012 --> 00:37:41.317]  Who is now lecturing Trump about empowering ISIS after he wants to get rid of a forever war.
[00:37:42.058 --> 00:37:53.325]  Remember back in 2013 when Rand Paul asked her, said, you know, quite frankly, I'm glad that you took responsibility for this because I would have fired you if I was president.
[00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:58.168]  And then she goes on to dump responsibility away from herself.
[00:37:58.288 --> 00:37:59.488]  She dumps it on her number two.
[00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:01.890]  For the number two on down, it's their fault, she said.
[00:38:02.998 --> 00:38:06.701]  But Rand Paul also asked her about weapons that were being supplied to Turkey.
[00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:12.305]  Some of those weapons were being sent to forces in Syria.
[00:38:13.486 --> 00:38:19.350]  And because Erdogan was using ISIS at the time, just like we were using ISIS.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.022]  To try to achieve regime change.
[00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:34.471]  And she said, she had the audacity to say in that hearing, well, if you want to know about arms being shipped out of Benghazi to terrorists, you'll have to talk to the agency that was running the annex.
[00:38:34.511 --> 00:38:35.712]  Well, who was running the annex?
[00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:36.833]  That would be the CIA.
[00:38:37.674 --> 00:38:40.216]  But Hillary Clinton isn't going to say, you've got to ask the CIA.
[00:38:40.656 --> 00:38:46.041]  She's clever enough, devious and clever enough to say, ask the agency that was running the annex.
[00:38:48.178 --> 00:39:03.299]  And when we look at what was happening in the roundup to this, I played on Friday, I played John McCain's clip where he said Hillary and the national security team wanted to arm ISIS and Obama said no and then McCain said he's weak!
[00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:06.445]  Of course, McCain was meeting with a terrorist.
[00:39:06.746 --> 00:39:08.166]  Hillary wanted to arm ISIS.
[00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:11.747]  The question is, did they disobey Obama?
[00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:14.067]  Or did Obama change his mind?
[00:39:14.087 --> 00:39:15.208]  Was he in on it or whatever?
[00:39:15.228 --> 00:39:15.928]  Because they did.
[00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:16.808]  They did arm them.
[00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:25.550]  And we had Michael Flynn, back in 2015, saying it was a willful decision to arm ISIS.
[00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.131]  I mean, McCain is admitting it.
[00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:31.992]  Everybody knows that they were arming ISIS, and now they want to say that President Trump
[00:39:33.047 --> 00:39:33.147]  Is
[00:39:56.363 --> 00:39:59.706]  Mattis is the number two guy there, Patrick Shanahan.
[00:39:59.746 --> 00:40:03.008]  Now, he is a defense contractor from Boeing.
[00:40:03.048 --> 00:40:04.729]  He's part of the military-industrial complex.
[00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:08.973]  I don't expect him to be somebody who is on the side of us defending America.
[00:40:08.993 --> 00:40:12.635]  You know, every time it comes to protecting our borders, what do we hear?
[00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:14.977]  We hear, well, that's not a threat.
[00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:19.781]  All these entanglements that we've got abroad, those are the real threats.
[00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:21.542]  There's no legal authority to do this.
[00:40:21.562 --> 00:40:23.624]  You know, when you go back to Syria, they built a dozen
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.781]  Military bases in Syria?
[00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:27.202]  You know, they're occupying a third of the country.
[00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:27.942]  The U.S.
[00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:30.204]  military built a dozen military bases.
[00:40:30.224 --> 00:40:31.605]  Did you know that they're doing that with your money?
[00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:35.408]  Did you know that they also built four air bases there?
[00:40:36.709 --> 00:40:39.090]  Now, who approved that money?
[00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:41.452]  Where did that money come from?
[00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:45.395]  You know, we talk about $5 billion for the wall, and we can't come up with that.
[00:40:46.606 --> 00:40:49.969]  Back in the 1960s, I think it was, it was Everett Dirksen.
[00:40:50.029 --> 00:40:50.930]  He was a Republican.
[00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.032]  That was when they had Republicans coming from Illinois.
[00:40:53.052 --> 00:40:56.655]  And I'm not talking about going all the way back to Abraham Lincoln, but it's probably pretty close.
[00:40:57.876 --> 00:41:00.938]  But he said, yeah, a million dollars here and a million dollars there.
[00:41:00.978 --> 00:41:02.439]  Pretty soon you're talking about real money.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:09.145]  Well, today we just throw around billions of dollars like they're pennies because we've got a $4 trillion expenditure budget that we have.
[00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:19.171]  And yet, the $5 billion, which is chump change, folks, it's one-eighth of a penny of what we spend.
[00:41:20.871 --> 00:41:22.191]  One-eighth of one percent.
[00:41:23.252 --> 00:41:26.292]  And they can't find the money for that, because they don't want our borders protected.
[00:41:26.473 --> 00:41:30.914]  So they say, we can't find the money for it, there's no authority for it, there isn't any risk, and on and on.
[00:41:30.974 --> 00:41:32.214]  They're lecturing President Trump.
[00:41:32.234 --> 00:41:34.775]  You've got Jim Acosta getting in his face, saying, they're not coming here.
[00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:37.847]  They'll dissipate, and it's nothing to be afraid of.
[00:41:37.907 --> 00:41:43.470]  And yet we have more than a caravan coming across that are intercepted each week.
[00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.751]  That's not counting the people who get into this country illegally.
[00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:50.093]  Those are just the people that are caught by Border Patrol.
[00:41:50.593 --> 00:41:52.894]  That's more than a caravan a week is caught.
[00:41:54.835 --> 00:41:56.635]  This is an existential issue, folks.
[00:41:57.576 --> 00:42:00.157]  So are the foreign wars that go forever.
[00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:01.818]  That is also an existential issue.
[00:42:02.614 --> 00:42:04.855]  And the Federal Reserve is an existential issue.
[00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:07.975]  I'm going to play that report for you coming up.
[00:42:08.475 --> 00:42:11.896]  Again, it's a wonderful lie, talking about the creation of the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:12.336 --> 00:42:18.097]  Talking about how many senators at the time said that's going to give them the power to create boom and bust cycles.
[00:42:18.157 --> 00:42:24.099]  And of course, we had Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Fed, say, yeah, we caused the Great Depression.
[00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:25.379]  Sorry about that.
[00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:26.379]  We won't do it again.
[00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:27.259]  Oh, really?
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.620]  I think maybe they will do it again.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.903]  Folks, we still have the specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:34.003 --> 00:42:38.987]  If you haven't been by there to take a look at what we've got, it's an end-of-year total store clearance.
[00:42:39.668 --> 00:42:42.310]  And we've extended our Christmas specials to the end of the year.
[00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:47.874]  You can get free shipping storewide, double Patriot points, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:42:47.934 --> 00:42:49.735]  Take a look at all the daily specials.
[00:42:49.856 --> 00:42:51.277]  We had 24-hour daily specials.
[00:42:51.617 --> 00:42:52.077]  They're back.
[00:42:52.638 --> 00:42:53.779]  Some things are up to 75% off.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.681]  We really do appreciate your support.
[00:42:57.701 --> 00:42:59.963]  We'll be right back with that special Christmas report.
[00:43:00.003 --> 00:43:00.903]  It's a wonderful lie.
[00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:17.676]  If you study why InfoWars is public enemy number one for the globalists, you understand why they're panicking.
[00:43:17.716 --> 00:43:19.717]  You understand what they're scared of.
[00:43:19.777 --> 00:43:21.098]  They're scared of nationalism.
[00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:23.360]  They're scared of patriotism.
[00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:28.682]  They are scared of people that will stand up for their sovereignty and who are territorial.
[00:43:29.442 --> 00:43:44.792]  Because we have these multinational corporations that have slave factories, literal concentration camps in China, like Apple and others, who see us as weak and stupid, and they have this whole leftist ideology that's meant to basically weaken us and divide and conquer us, but it's not working anymore.
[00:43:45.252 --> 00:43:51.476]  And the globalists have been able to track back where the main resistance in the last 20 years came from,
[00:43:52.096 --> 00:44:02.821]  And that main resistance has been my syndicated radio show, the documentary films we've made that have been seen hundreds of millions of times, and the other news operations that we've set up.
[00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:13.825]  And that's why we're under such attack, and that's why we can't give up in the face of the globalist onslaught, because we've already launched the Americana movement, the new renaissance, 1776, worldwide.
[00:44:14.165 --> 00:44:14.846]  It's happening!
[00:44:15.246 --> 00:44:16.466]  This isn't a hoax!
[00:44:16.747 --> 00:44:17.767]  This isn't hype!
[00:44:18.147 --> 00:44:19.388]  Infowars is real!
[00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:29.925]  That's why the enemy media is always saying we're a hoax, or always saying we're fake, or always saying we're a fraud, because they don't know how to counter something that's the opposite of them.
[00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:34.749]  When they say we're a hoax or a fraud, they're talking about themselves.
[00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:38.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can see us here in one of our new state-of-the-art studios.
[00:44:38.751 --> 00:44:40.553]  I was planning by the end of 2018 to be 24 hours a day live.
[00:44:42.654 --> 00:44:43.454]  On radio and TV.
[00:44:43.775 --> 00:44:48.877]  And we only launched two new shows in 2018, CounterThink and The War Room, and they do a great job.
[00:44:49.037 --> 00:44:52.218]  We also, right before that started, launched The Real News with David Knight.
[00:44:52.338 --> 00:44:54.059]  And we've expanded in the face of the attacks.
[00:44:54.119 --> 00:45:00.602]  But I really, in the next three or four months, want to be able to go at least 20 hours a day live by the spring.
[00:45:00.722 --> 00:45:07.905]  And that's going to take major support by you, the audience, to get around the censorship, to get around the boycotts, to get around the globalist lawsuits.
[00:45:08.165 --> 00:45:08.986]  And you've been doing it
[00:45:10.282 --> 00:45:10.803]  So far.
[00:45:11.043 --> 00:45:12.184]  But I need your prayers.
[00:45:12.345 --> 00:45:13.105]  I need your support.
[00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:15.869]  I need your word of mouth that's unstoppable and overrides the censors.
[00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:29.364]  And I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com as we go into the new year where I'm going to extend all the Christmas specials that were the biggest in our history to sell out of all of our products so we don't have to pay inventory tax by January 1st.
[00:45:29.524 --> 00:45:30.105]  Everything is
[00:45:30.145 --> 00:45:30.645]  We're good to go.
[00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:55.124]  These are our biggest deals ever because we're also coming online with a new sponsorship model to augment our sales direct so there's no way the globalists can shut us down.
[00:45:55.204 --> 00:45:57.266]  We aren't just going to continue to fight.
[00:45:57.406 --> 00:46:01.288]  We're going to win thanks to your steadfast prayer and financial support.
[00:46:01.408 --> 00:46:03.250]  So again, the three pillars of this.
[00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:04.851]  Praying to God.
[00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:08.570]  Spreading the word about the articles and videos and taking action.
[00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.330]  Or doing your own show.
[00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:10.010]  Or doing both.
[00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.091]  And then of course, ladies and gentlemen, financial support.
[00:46:13.451 --> 00:46:14.251]  That's a three-legged stool.
[00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:18.292]  You can also add reaching out to local radio and TV stations.
[00:46:18.392 --> 00:46:18.972]  Thanking them.
[00:46:19.732 --> 00:46:20.612]  Thanking their sponsors.
[00:46:20.892 --> 00:46:21.793]  Becoming a sponsor.
[00:46:22.153 --> 00:46:25.973]  As Christians and conservatives and nationalists, we're quiet people that are confident.
[00:46:26.274 --> 00:46:27.374]  We're not like leftist bullies.
[00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:31.035]  Not to bully anybody, you've just got to have your voice be heard.
[00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:39.756]  So, all the Christmas specials that we have are all extended until products sell out right through until January 1st, 2019.
[00:46:40.136 --> 00:46:42.857]  InfoWarsTore.com is the umbrella site for everything.
[00:46:43.017 --> 00:46:45.017]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[00:46:45.057 --> 00:46:46.297]  These are amazing products.
[00:46:46.577 --> 00:46:47.578]  Take advantage of them today.
[00:46:47.618 --> 00:46:50.038]  And to all the listeners that have been supporting us for years, thank you.
[00:46:50.478 --> 00:46:52.218]  What we've done to the globalists is thanks to you.
[00:46:52.538 --> 00:46:53.739]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:54.979]  You are the resistance.
[00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:14.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:21.272 --> 00:47:21.852]  Welcome back!
[00:47:21.992 --> 00:47:30.993]  This last week we saw the 72nd anniversary of It's a Wonderful Life and the 105th anniversary of the Federal Reserve created on December the 21st, 1913.
[00:47:34.417 --> 00:47:40.342]  And I did a report in 2013 called It's a Wonderful Lie, talking about how we were manipulated into having a Federal Reserve.
[00:47:40.362 --> 00:47:44.365]  You know, everybody's asking, can President Trump fire the Fed Chairman?
[00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:51.912]  We need to be asking the question why we even have a Fed Chairman in charge of our economy and what they have been doing to us.
[00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:54.294]  We'll talk a little bit more about that coming up, but I want to play for you.
[00:47:55.014 --> 00:48:01.460]  It's a Wonderful Lie is done on the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Reserve surreptitiously on that Christmas.
[00:48:03.937 --> 00:48:11.838]  Over the last 100 years, the Federal Reserve has created bubbles and burst them, enslaved us with debt, and destroyed our purchasing power through inflation.
[00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:15.799]  Yes, it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers.
[00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:23.641]  There are striking parallels in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life to the lies and tricks that real bankers used to create the Federal Reserve.
[00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:31.822]  Human nature doesn't change, and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look and act a lot like Potter, the banker in the movie.
[00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:40.047]  And many Americans are left like George Bailey, staring into the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin.
[00:48:40.347 --> 00:48:43.569]  Do we live in a country that looks a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls?
[00:48:43.949 --> 00:48:48.332]  What does Frank Capra's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out?
[00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:57.097]  When the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas 100 years ago, it was a culmination of six years of fraud, fear, and manipulation.
[00:48:57.517 --> 00:49:00.599]  I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
[00:49:12.244 --> 00:49:15.406]  There's a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
[00:49:15.466 --> 00:49:16.247]  Is that true?
[00:49:16.267 --> 00:49:19.970]  I am going all out to help in this crisis.
[00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:25.193]  I have just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.
[00:49:26.034 --> 00:49:28.956]  They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
[00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:31.118]  Just took over the bank.
[00:49:32.484 --> 00:49:37.346]  I may lose a fortune, but I am willing to guarantee your people, too.
[00:49:37.927 --> 00:49:42.809]  Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
[00:49:43.209 --> 00:49:44.990]  Oh, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
[00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.250]  Unfortunately, J.P.
[00:49:46.711 --> 00:49:52.613]  Morgan got away with the deception, and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices.
[00:49:53.053 --> 00:49:55.514]  Uh, take during the Depression, for instance.
[00:49:56.155 --> 00:49:58.576]  You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
[00:49:59.289 --> 00:50:00.690]  You saved the building and lawn.
[00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.692]  I saved all the rest.
[00:50:03.313 --> 00:50:05.835]  Yes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.
[00:50:05.855 --> 00:50:08.017]  The envious ones say that, George.
[00:50:08.057 --> 00:50:08.918]  The suckers!
[00:50:09.198 --> 00:50:10.379]  Charles Lindbergh Sr.
[00:50:10.419 --> 00:50:18.446]  warned people at the time of the creation of the Federal Reserve that it would not stop booming bus cycles, but would actually create them in order to benefit its private owners.
[00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:19.507]  Here's what he said.
[00:50:20.171 --> 00:50:28.219]  To cause high prices, all the Federal Reserve Board will do will be to lower the re-discount rate, producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market.
[00:50:28.499 --> 00:50:34.625]  Then, when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions, it can check prosperity in mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest.
[00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:42.113]  It can cause a pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth, or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation.
[00:50:42.941 --> 00:50:50.308]  And in either case, it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions and advanced knowledge of the coming change, either up or down.
[00:50:51.108 --> 00:50:58.015]  This is the strangest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged class by any government that ever existed.
[00:50:58.535 --> 00:51:04.701]  The system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money.
[00:51:05.081 --> 00:51:09.425]  They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage, and they know when to stop panic.
[00:51:10.316 --> 00:51:14.921]  Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control the finance.
[00:51:15.562 --> 00:51:19.887]  As we see in the movie, not all lending institutions have the same motivations.
[00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:23.591]  Now you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop.
[00:51:24.238 --> 00:51:29.921]  You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know?
[00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:33.804]  I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
[00:51:33.864 --> 00:51:38.566]  But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000!
[00:51:39.287 --> 00:51:39.807]  Why?
[00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:43.449]  Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
[00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:46.231]  You have all the papers there, his salary, insurance.
[00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:47.811]  I can personally vouch for his character.
[00:51:48.052 --> 00:51:48.552]  Friend of yours.
[00:51:50.738 --> 00:51:55.763]  You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
[00:51:56.944 --> 00:51:58.285]  What does that get us?
[00:51:58.625 --> 00:52:03.670]  A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
[00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:11.477]  As a former FDIC chair said, all too often the large banks use their models and their algorithms, and if you don't fit in their boxes, you don't get the loan.
[00:52:12.057 --> 00:52:17.359]  And Dodd-Frank legislation is tying the hands of small lenders, shutting out buyers, and shutting down lenders.
[00:52:17.679 --> 00:52:21.820]  Today, there are fewer lenders than at any time the government has kept records.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.320]  10,000 banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:31.603]  This town needs this measly one-horse institution, if only to have some place where people can come without crawling the potter.
[00:52:35.522 --> 00:52:44.246]  If it hadn't been for you... Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody would be a lot better off.
[00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:49.468]  My wife and my kids and my friends and my... Look, little fella, why don't you go off and haunt somebody else?
[00:52:49.688 --> 00:52:53.710]  Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
[00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.912]  Well, I don't know.
[00:52:56.932 --> 00:52:57.632]  I guess you're right.
[00:53:00.257 --> 00:53:02.239]  It's both been better if I'd never been born at all.
[00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:05.581]  Pottersville, the only businesses thriving are vice.
[00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:06.842]  People are angry.
[00:53:07.282 --> 00:53:10.485]  The town is filled with signs like, keep moving, keep off the grass.
[00:53:11.425 --> 00:53:15.668]  The cop actually shoots at George when he's running away and is no threat to anyone.
[00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:16.829]  Stand back!
[00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.411]  Everyone is a renter.
[00:53:19.471 --> 00:53:20.932]  No one has a stake.
[00:53:25.373 --> 00:53:28.254]  Now, you're Arnie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid.
[00:53:28.314 --> 00:53:29.534]  Look, bud, what's the idea?
[00:53:29.634 --> 00:53:31.155]  I live in a shack in Pottersville.
[00:53:31.195 --> 00:53:35.116]  My wife ran away three years ago and took the kid, and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
[00:53:35.316 --> 00:53:39.757]  Private property and everyone having a stake is the antidote to Pottersville.
[00:53:40.198 --> 00:53:41.698]  Here, you're all businessmen here.
[00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.258]  Don't it make them better citizens?
[00:53:43.298 --> 00:53:44.479]  Doesn't it make them better customers?
[00:53:44.759 --> 00:53:51.341]  But whether it's the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a global carbon tax, the global elite don't see you as a stakeholder.
[00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:55.002]  They want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle.
[00:53:55.362 --> 00:54:02.166]  Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
[00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:06.608]  Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
[00:54:07.269 --> 00:54:08.890]  Anyway, my father didn't think so.
[00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:14.513]  People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
[00:54:15.447 --> 00:54:17.868]  Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
[00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.549]  I'm not interested in your book.
[00:54:19.649 --> 00:54:22.170]  I'm talking about the building and loan.
[00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.151]  I know very well what you're talking about.
[00:54:24.171 --> 00:54:26.312]  You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on.
[00:54:26.752 --> 00:54:31.554]  Speaking of riches, do you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy George off?
[00:54:31.715 --> 00:54:32.875]  Let's look at your side.
[00:54:34.636 --> 00:54:35.977]  Young man, 27, 28, married.
[00:54:39.682 --> 00:54:41.023]  Make me say 40 a week.
[00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:41.023]  45.
[00:54:41.063 --> 00:54:41.023]  45.
[00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:42.505]  45.
[00:54:41.103 --> 00:54:42.505]  George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
[00:54:55.817 --> 00:54:56.217]  $20,000 a year?
[00:54:56.958 --> 00:54:59.741]  You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town?
[00:55:00.341 --> 00:55:02.363]  Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes?
[00:55:02.943 --> 00:55:05.566]  A couple of business trips to New York a year?
[00:55:05.826 --> 00:55:07.367]  Maybe once in a while Europe?
[00:55:07.768 --> 00:55:09.189]  You wouldn't mind that, would you, Jones?
[00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:09.870]  Would I?
[00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.312]  Even if George had saved a lot of
[00:55:15.831 --> 00:55:25.261]  Decades later, by even the government's very conservative estimate of inflation, the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947, when the movie was made.
[00:55:25.662 --> 00:55:31.228]  The Fed's deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving.
[00:55:31.818 --> 00:55:39.022]  So what is the answer to all the George Baileys out there a hundred years after the government gave control of our money supply to private bankers like Potter?
[00:55:39.382 --> 00:55:41.904]  Well, Potter had more money than he could spend.
[00:55:42.184 --> 00:55:44.405]  But would any of you want to be Potter?
[00:55:44.805 --> 00:55:49.608]  You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
[00:55:49.628 --> 00:55:50.769]  Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter!
[00:55:52.294 --> 00:55:57.097]  In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
[00:55:57.617 --> 00:56:04.440]  George Bailey finally sees how rich his own life is, as he sees the fruits of relationship, honesty, and compassion.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:04.580]  Hey!
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.162]  Merry Christmas, Mr. Boyd!
[00:56:09.222 --> 00:56:10.342]  Happy New Year to you!
[00:56:10.863 --> 00:56:11.603]  In jail!
[00:56:11.763 --> 00:56:13.504]  Go on home, they're waiting for you!
[00:56:14.861 --> 00:56:21.404]  And if the public can awaken to the lies of the Federal Reserve, if it could even be audited... Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
[00:56:21.484 --> 00:56:26.026]  It would be a huge step to breaking the chains that enslave all of us.
[00:56:26.046 --> 00:56:30.028]  But ultimately, it is God that changes minds and changes hearts.
[00:56:30.108 --> 00:56:35.251]  God hates oppression, and we can and should confidently pray that he will stop it.
[00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:38.252]  I owe everything to George Bailey.
[00:56:39.073 --> 00:56:40.613]  Help him, dear father.
[00:56:41.554 --> 00:56:43.915]  Joseph, Jesus, and Mary.
[00:56:44.773 --> 00:56:46.674]  Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.
[00:56:47.755 --> 00:56:50.117]  Help my son, George, tonight.
[00:56:50.977 --> 00:56:52.699]  He never thinks about himself, God.
[00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:53.759]  That's why he's in trouble.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:55.721]  George is a good guy.
[00:56:55.741 --> 00:56:58.142]  Give him a break, God.
[00:56:58.162 --> 00:57:00.324]  I love him, dear Lord.
[00:57:00.604 --> 00:57:01.705]  Watch over him tonight.
[00:57:02.505 --> 00:57:03.506]  Please, God.
[00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:06.088]  Something's the matter with Daddy.
[00:57:06.788 --> 00:57:08.149]  Please bring Daddy back.
[00:57:15.316 --> 00:57:26.729]  I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
[00:57:27.149 --> 00:57:32.095]  For the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:41.377]  And again, if you want to see that, or pass that around, you'll find it on our BitChute and Brighteon channels, because that was the very first thing that YouTube took down.
[00:57:41.417 --> 00:57:47.042]  You don't talk about the Federal Reserve without having them take you off and deplatform you.
[00:57:47.342 --> 00:57:48.142]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:57:48.182 --> 00:57:49.504]  We've got some Christmas news.
[00:57:49.544 --> 00:57:51.005]  We'll have more news about the border.
[00:57:54.929 --> 00:57:59.271]  We've done incredible things in our time, all of us in the Infowars community.
[00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:02.452]  And that's why we're the number one target by tyrants worldwide.
[00:58:03.312 --> 00:58:05.913]  And we could revel in our time, what we've already done.
[00:58:07.014 --> 00:58:10.355]  But the real battle for the future of civilization is just now heating up.
[00:58:11.236 --> 00:58:14.637]  That's why the censorship and the demonization and the tyranny is out in the open.
[00:58:15.557 --> 00:58:16.978]  Because the controllers are scared.
[00:58:18.183 --> 00:58:24.344]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare to close out 2018, I cannot stress on you enough how I want to salute you.
[00:58:25.085 --> 00:58:27.505]  I cannot stress enough how much I want to thank you.
[00:58:28.105 --> 00:58:31.226]  I cannot stress enough how epic this battle is.
[00:58:31.766 --> 00:58:38.828]  The globalists literally want to capture all of civilization, all of the life process, not just of humans, but of plants and animals.
[00:58:39.548 --> 00:58:40.788]  They want to be God.
[00:58:40.888 --> 00:58:42.029]  They want to play God.
[00:58:42.369 --> 00:58:45.170]  They want to be omnipresent and surveil everything we do.
[00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:49.531]  They want us to take microchips and digital barcodes to buy and sell.
[00:58:50.911 --> 00:58:57.473]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[00:58:59.062 --> 00:59:10.746]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:59:11.267 --> 00:59:19.890]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:25.432]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:32.026]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and you tend to see it, and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:59:32.686 --> 00:59:35.367]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:59:35.387 --> 00:59:37.308]  2018 has been insane.
[00:59:37.328 --> 00:59:43.792]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:59:44.672 --> 00:59:48.334]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[00:59:48.354 --> 00:59:52.436]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:58.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.081 --> 01:00:00.422]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:10.129 --> 01:00:10.610]  News.
[01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.991]  Analysis.
[01:00:12.511 --> 01:00:13.192]  Reports.
[01:00:13.952 --> 01:00:16.094]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:19.657]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:00:23.223 --> 01:00:23.723]  Welcome back.
[01:00:23.763 --> 01:00:29.386]  In this hour, we're going to talk about why President Trump actually can and must do something to move against the Federal Reserve.
[01:00:29.406 --> 01:00:35.468]  Whether firing the chairman is the right move or not, certainly he has cause to fire him.
[01:00:36.288 --> 01:00:42.311]  When you look at what was done this last weekend, I reported before they announced that they were going to raise interest rates.
[01:00:43.331 --> 01:00:47.673]  You had one economist say, and he's not the only one who said it, but I like the way that he put it.
[01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:51.695]  He said, if they raise interest rates, they ought to all be fired.
[01:00:52.771 --> 01:00:54.612]  For malpractice.
[01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:59.175]  And that's exactly what it means to fire somebody for cause.
[01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:14.245]  And we're going to talk a little bit in detail about what that clause about firing for cause actually means in the Federal Reserve Act that was surreptitiously enacted late at Christmas as most of the people had gone home.
[01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:21.630]  Now we have a lot of action that is taking place in Washington, and yet I want to give you, before we
[01:01:22.754 --> 01:01:23.615]  Get back into that.
[01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.696]  Some Christmas update news.
[01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:26.657]  You know, we have Michael Moore.
[01:01:26.677 --> 01:01:29.179]  I saw this today.
[01:01:29.479 --> 01:01:33.482]  He has now put a Christmas tree topper on his Christmas tree this year.
[01:01:34.643 --> 01:01:39.466]  And he's not going to honor anything that is Christian.
[01:01:39.506 --> 01:01:43.970]  He's going to honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg, or as I call her, Darth Vader Ginsburg.
[01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.912]  She's had yet another cancer scare.
[01:01:48.032 --> 01:01:49.494]  But he says that
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.166]  His Christmas tree topper this year is better than an angel or a star over Bethlehem.
[01:01:56.406 --> 01:01:59.430]  It is this Supreme Court justice.
[01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.193]  This authoritarian.
[01:02:02.338 --> 01:02:10.642]  And I said, you know, do you remember when, I tweeted this out on Libertarian, if you want to follow me on Twitter, that's my handle, Libertarian, not Libertarian, but Libertitarian.
[01:02:11.403 --> 01:02:13.704]  I said, remember Obama's very first White House Christmas?
[01:02:14.384 --> 01:02:21.708]  Everybody's freaking out about Melania Trump having red artificial Christmas trees or whatever as a style choice.
[01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:34.943]  But they were bending over backwards to defend President Obama on his very first Christmas, December 2009, when he had ornaments that celebrated Mal and transgenders.
[01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:41.805]  And of course what they did was they picked a guy who was already a controversial figure.
[01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:46.207]  He was a creative director of Barney's New York.
[01:02:47.307 --> 01:02:50.069]  And he had things that he would put up for displays.
[01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:55.092]  Things like a Christmas window display of Margaret Thatcher as a dowdy dominatrix.
[01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:58.314]  Dan Quayle as a ventriloquist dummy and so forth.
[01:02:58.334 --> 01:03:01.996]  So who would you go to to do your Christmas decorations but somebody like that?
[01:03:02.276 --> 01:03:05.258]  And what he came up with was Mal Christmas decorations.
[01:03:05.278 --> 01:03:06.699]  Remember the pictures that they had?
[01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:08.060]  I think they've been taken down now.
[01:03:08.981 --> 01:03:14.044]  But also he put up an ornament of a legendary transvestite.
[01:03:15.976 --> 01:03:18.417]  And just, you know, we're not supposed to be concerned about that.
[01:03:18.457 --> 01:03:23.820]  And so I said, you know, when you look at this and you look at Michael Moore, you know, it was okay to celebrate Mao on Christmas.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:34.565]  It's okay to celebrate that other Marxist who has stood tirelessly to kill as many babies as possible as we celebrate the Nativity.
[01:03:34.585 --> 01:03:38.407]  You can put somebody up there who has presided over the murder of children.
[01:03:39.427 --> 01:03:44.770]  And I said, you can't find three wise men, or women for that matter, in the entire Democrat Party.
[01:03:45.834 --> 01:03:48.857]  And it also tells you what their religion is, doesn't it?
[01:03:49.997 --> 01:03:52.780]  Their religion is to worship government.
[01:03:54.031 --> 01:04:04.357]  I also said, in China, you've got President Xi who demands that inside a church building, if they put up a crucifix, he demands that there be a picture of Mao.
[01:04:04.377 --> 01:04:06.338]  Well, Obama would be proud, right?
[01:04:06.898 --> 01:04:08.259]  He'd take it from Obama's Christmas tree.
[01:04:08.479 --> 01:04:15.943]  No, you have a crucifix in your Chinese church, you have to have on one side a portrait of Mao and on the other side a portrait of President Xi.
[01:04:16.924 --> 01:04:22.667]  But here, the useful idiots, like Michael Moore, worship government voluntarily.
[01:04:23.595 --> 01:04:25.356]  They worship these authoritarians voluntarily.
[01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:31.258]  You know, we had the first ever Arctic bank robbery they put out.
[01:04:31.278 --> 01:04:34.779]  And I thought, is this climate change?
[01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:35.999]  Are they talking about a snow bank?
[01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:38.160]  I didn't know they had banks in the Arctic.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.881]  Actually, this is between Scandinavia and the North Pole.
[01:04:42.821 --> 01:04:44.082]  They had an armed robbery there.
[01:04:45.459 --> 01:04:50.784]  I don't know if they're taking away our climate or if they're taking away the cash.
[01:04:50.844 --> 01:04:53.927]  Maybe that's where Santa Claus keeps his cash, right there at that bank.
[01:04:54.828 --> 01:04:55.589]  Close to the North Pole.
[01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:56.850]  Or maybe he's gone to crypto.
[01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:57.330]  I don't know.
[01:04:57.751 --> 01:05:00.193]  If he's gone to crypto, we may not even have a Christmas this year.
[01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:01.274]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:01.955]  I'm David Knight.
[01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:18.154]  If the Deep State and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[01:05:18.634 --> 01:05:25.638]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America, because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[01:05:26.058 --> 01:05:28.840]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:36.503]  I am very grateful for all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[01:05:36.803 --> 01:05:39.324]  But now I need your help as never before.
[01:05:39.784 --> 01:05:42.605]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:05:42.945 --> 01:05:44.646]  Help me stand up for America.
[01:05:44.826 --> 01:05:47.847]  Because if they get Roger Stone, you may be next.

[01:05:58.566 --> 01:06:00.206]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:17.874]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:18.254 --> 01:06:21.176]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:06:21.956 --> 01:06:24.457]  Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
[01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.210]  Welcome back.
[01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:32.594]  You know, we have Michael Moore putting Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Darth Vader Ginsburg, up on the top of his Christmas tree to honor her.
[01:06:32.654 --> 01:06:37.877]  Better than any angel, anything that has to do with Christianity, of course, right?
[01:06:38.437 --> 01:06:44.761]  Maybe he just put, get the Mao decorations that are left over from the Obama administration from their Christmas tree.
[01:06:45.782 --> 01:06:49.484]  But we have in Scotland something that I think is even crazier.
[01:06:49.524 --> 01:06:54.187]  As we look at all of the political correctness that is surrounding the season,
[01:06:55.202 --> 01:06:57.084]  It goes beyond maybe it's cold outside.
[01:06:57.284 --> 01:07:01.729]  I guess they are saying that in Scotland because it really is cold in Scotland this time of year, especially if you're wearing a kilt.
[01:07:02.249 --> 01:07:08.256]  But I guess years of wearing a kilt has confused the Scottish Parliament on gingerbread men.
[01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:12.961]  They have now banned the term gingerbread men because they said it promotes sexism.
[01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:15.483]  So you've got to have ginger persons.
[01:07:16.573 --> 01:07:23.658]  And we're not talking about redheaded persons, we're talking about... But you know, I think maybe they should just call them gender trans.
[01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:28.001]  Because you know, these cookies don't have any genitals on them.
[01:07:28.781 --> 01:07:34.165]  So there is no objective biological basis to determine what their sex is, right?
[01:07:34.622 --> 01:07:36.984]  And especially even if you flare it out like a skirt or something.
[01:07:37.004 --> 01:07:39.306]  I mean, they already have kilts in Scotland.
[01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:43.369]  So we could just go just like real transgenders, right?
[01:07:43.509 --> 01:07:46.071]  It isn't based on any genitals.
[01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:48.153]  It's based on how you decorate them.
[01:07:48.893 --> 01:07:53.837]  So you could just decorate them and they could be whatever gender you want it to be.
[01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.138]  The gender-bred men.
[01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.539]  Oh, I'm sorry, not men.
[01:07:56.879 --> 01:07:58.501]  The gender-bred persons.
[01:07:58.901 --> 01:07:59.542]  Gender-bred.
[01:08:00.262 --> 01:08:04.425]  Yeah, maybe it's bred as B-R-E-D.
[01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:11.431]  That's what they have bred into the minds of these kids that they have hammered this political correctness into for generations.
[01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:12.391]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:08:13.232 --> 01:08:18.056]  In other Christmas news, I guess travel news, we have the TSA has made it official.
[01:08:18.716 --> 01:08:20.738]  They're not about air safety at all.
[01:08:20.938 --> 01:08:22.199]  It's never been about air safety.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.003]  It has always been about exercising control and harassing people.
[01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:29.920]  It is theater.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.280]  It is security theater.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.941]  And we pointed this out years ago.
[01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:36.642]  We had Jonathan Corbett do a lawsuit.
[01:08:38.222 --> 01:08:42.964]  And he said, you have, he basically defeated the scanners, the body scanners that they had there.
[01:08:44.244 --> 01:08:45.805]  And he sued them over that.
[01:08:45.985 --> 01:08:53.387]  As part of his lawsuit and discovery, he was able to find that going back to 2011, they said there is no threat.
[01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:58.014]  Against any airplanes or airports.
[01:08:58.054 --> 01:09:05.140]  Now this was happening at the same time that Texas was pushing back on all this mandatory manhandling of children and so forth.
[01:09:06.221 --> 01:09:11.705]  Sexually assaulting people as a precondition to traveling in the United States of America.
[01:09:13.126 --> 01:09:18.491]  And you had the Texas House unanimously pass a bill that said you're not going to do that here.
[01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:21.093]  That's an unwarranted search.
[01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:25.184]  And so many different meanings of the word unwarranted.
[01:09:26.305 --> 01:09:34.673]  And to push that back, you had the Lieutenant Governor here in Texas at the time, Dewhurst, a retired CIA guy.
[01:09:34.773 --> 01:09:35.554]  He was a made man.
[01:09:36.015 --> 01:09:40.939]  After he retired the CIA, they set him up in the oil business, the Bushes, and so forth.
[01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:41.800]  He got very wealthy.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.625]  He spent more money than anybody's ever spent to get elected to statewide office here in Texas.
[01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:52.914]  And then he spearheaded the move along with the federal TSA to shut that down in the Senate here in Texas.
[01:09:53.935 --> 01:10:04.081]  But as they were doing that and threatening to turn Texas into a no-fly zone, they also had internal memos that said there is no threat to airports or to airplanes.
[01:10:05.102 --> 01:10:05.962]  Now, how do we know that?
[01:10:06.963 --> 01:10:16.188]  They also posted on Pacer.gov, where they put all the lawsuits up, they posted up on Pacer.gov, by accident, the unredacted lawsuit.
[01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.169]  They didn't want you to see that.
[01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:22.082]  And they left it up there for a while and we saw that and we reported it here at InfoWars.
[01:10:22.102 --> 01:10:23.642]  We're the only news outlet that reported that.
[01:10:23.682 --> 01:10:31.544]  Nobody else wanted to report what they wanted to cover up because they put that up for a while and then they took it down and they replaced it with their redacted version.
[01:10:31.624 --> 01:10:35.665]  So we snapshotted both of those and said, oh, here's what they don't want you to know.
[01:10:36.285 --> 01:10:38.125]  They don't want you to know that there is no threat.
[01:10:38.645 --> 01:10:40.486]  So that's the reality of this.
[01:10:40.586 --> 01:10:42.126]  But now it's gotten more obvious.
[01:10:42.146 --> 01:10:45.487]  You know, one of the things that you could do to help security is to have air marshals.
[01:10:46.351 --> 01:10:46.811]  On the planes.
[01:10:46.891 --> 01:10:48.192]  And locks on the doors.
[01:10:48.392 --> 01:10:49.313]  Simple stuff like that.
[01:10:49.893 --> 01:10:56.557]  Instead of the big expensive machines that are going to bombard you with x-rays or the people are going to sexually harass you to travel.
[01:10:56.937 --> 01:11:05.202]  No, you could have air marshals, undercover agents, and now they're going to basically blow their cover by saying they must sit in the back of the plane.
[01:11:05.222 --> 01:11:07.744]  Why don't they just put a little sign around their neck?
[01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:08.824]  You know.
[01:11:09.104 --> 01:11:10.345]  Here are the air marshals.
[01:11:10.405 --> 01:11:11.346]  Take them out first.
[01:11:12.714 --> 01:11:14.476]  Again, it's not about air safety.
[01:11:15.457 --> 01:11:18.881]  Air safety takes a back seat, literally, to controlling people.
[01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:20.964]  We look at what happened at Gatwick Airport.
[01:11:21.605 --> 01:11:23.046]  That was shut down for days.
[01:11:23.106 --> 01:11:25.950]  They had hundreds of thousands of people that were camping out for a couple of days.
[01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.430]  Couldn't move.
[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:26.731]  Why?
[01:11:26.771 --> 01:11:29.914]  Because they had somebody flying drones.
[01:11:30.888 --> 01:11:31.428]  Around the area.
[01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:37.152]  Every time they would see the drone go up, they would shut down the air traffic because it was too dangerous.
[01:11:37.352 --> 01:11:39.493]  They might hit them, might cause a crash of the plane.
[01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:42.775]  And then they would go to get the drone and they would disappear.
[01:11:43.936 --> 01:11:46.238]  And as they'd pull back, they would reappear some other place.
[01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:48.759]  So it was obvious that they were playing a cat and mouse game with them.
[01:11:48.779 --> 01:11:49.900]  They were doing it deliberately.
[01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:58.005]  They said at the end of last week that they had used high-tech devices in order to find out who this was.
[01:11:59.079 --> 01:12:00.781]  And they arrested a couple of people.
[01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:10.254]  Paul Gate, 47, and his wife Elaine Kirk, 54, spent more than 36 hours being quizzed by detectives over the device that brought Gatwick Airport to its knees.
[01:12:10.315 --> 01:12:11.456]  They then returned home today.
[01:12:13.465 --> 01:12:18.467]  After friends and family insisted that they were not the eco-warriors behind the attack.
[01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:19.807]  And they haven't been charged.
[01:12:19.847 --> 01:12:23.128]  Though they were questioned for quite some time, they returned home without being charged.
[01:12:23.168 --> 01:12:25.729]  Their friends and neighbors say they didn't do it.
[01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:30.410]  So now it looks like for all their vaunted equipment, they had the wrong people.
[01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:32.091]  And they sent them home.
[01:12:33.071 --> 01:12:35.352]  President Trump, meanwhile, says drones are a lot of fun.
[01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:37.330]  Maybe he did it.
[01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:41.292]  No, CNN will probably blame it on him, but he has an alibi.
[01:12:41.312 --> 01:12:41.932]  He was in the U.S.
[01:12:41.972 --> 01:12:42.352]  at the time.
[01:12:43.133 --> 01:12:46.374]  But he says, only a good old-fashioned wall works.
[01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:48.335]  He's talking about the border.
[01:12:48.455 --> 01:12:56.098]  Yeah, we can put drones up and we can watch the people that are coming across the border, but you can't stop them with a drone, right?
[01:12:57.118 --> 01:13:01.000]  And you have to have some way to keep them from getting into the judicial system.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:02.440]  Why?
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.661]  Because the judges will
[01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:08.547]  Work against our interests, and that's why we have this government shutdown.
[01:13:08.807 --> 01:13:11.409]  And I hope it continues for a while.
[01:13:11.469 --> 01:13:18.713]  President Trump has done the right thing, but President Trump needs to understand he doesn't even, he has more power than he even recognizes at this moment.
[01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:27.237]  President Trump and White House Secretary Sarah Sanders have both now said, why is it that we can protect other countries, but we can't protect our borders?
[01:13:27.898 --> 01:13:29.439]  They're getting very close to the answer.
[01:13:30.618 --> 01:13:33.120]  The answer is that there is no problem.
[01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:38.145]  You have the authority and the duty to protect our country at the border, President Trump.
[01:13:39.306 --> 01:13:41.348]  And you don't need the permission of any judges to do it.
[01:13:41.889 --> 01:13:46.032]  You don't need funding from the Mexican government to do it.
[01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:49.055]  And you don't need funding even from the Congress to do it.
[01:13:49.516 --> 01:13:50.837]  You have a defense budget.
[01:13:51.798 --> 01:13:55.962]  How were we able to build a dozen military bases in Syria?
[01:13:57.083 --> 01:14:01.206]  And for air bases in Syria.
[01:14:01.307 --> 01:14:02.608]  How are we allowed to do that?
[01:14:03.068 --> 01:14:05.530]  Where was the money appropriated specifically for that?
[01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:06.050]  It wasn't.
[01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.173]  In general, it was supposedly about the defense of our country.
[01:14:09.933 --> 01:14:17.219]  I can make a much better case that we're defending our country at this border than you can about what's happening in Syria.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.041]  We're supposed to have a vote.
[01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:23.070]  Before we invade another country.
[01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:24.991]  We didn't have that vote under the Constitution.
[01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:34.316]  So all the people saying that President Trump can't do this legally at the border because of posse comitatus or some other imagined legal obstacle to that.
[01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:42.960]  Posse comitatus is about using the military as law enforcement in our country against our citizens.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:47.262]  This would be used to keep people who are not our citizens out of our country.
[01:14:47.302 --> 01:14:48.323]  Because once they get in the country,
[01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:53.562]  They then become the wards of the activist federal judges.
[01:14:55.222 --> 01:15:01.344]  And President Trump needs to understand that he has both the authority and the duty to protect our border.
[01:15:01.424 --> 01:15:07.605]  And that means using the military, using military expenditures to build the border, to build the wall, if necessary.
[01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.386]  I mean, even at the border.
[01:15:10.191 --> 01:15:12.972]  Once the people come across, they said, all right, we're not going to separate families.
[01:15:13.032 --> 01:15:16.254]  If somebody says that this is their child, we don't know.
[01:15:16.294 --> 01:15:19.075]  We don't have any papers or any way to get any information about them.
[01:15:19.536 --> 01:15:27.680]  So instead of separating them, we'll keep them together for a while until we can do some DNA testing or do something to try to determine who these people are.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.022]  They just showed up without any papers at our doorstep, wanting to be our dependents.
[01:15:34.223 --> 01:15:35.444]  And where do they go for all that?
[01:15:36.195 --> 01:15:38.837]  Well, they are taken to a military base.
[01:15:39.697 --> 01:15:43.599]  Where do we find the authority to house people from other countries?
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:49.823]  But we can't find the authority to keep them out of our country, to keep them out of our judicial system.
[01:15:51.204 --> 01:15:52.284]  And then we got Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:15:52.324 --> 01:15:54.445]  What a piece of excrement.
[01:15:54.565 --> 01:15:58.408]  Mocking the people who are donating to this GoFundMe wall.
[01:15:59.068 --> 01:16:01.950]  If our elected representatives won't fund it, we'll fund it ourselves.
[01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:03.991]  Tucker Carlson
[01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:15.799]  The number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a patriot and a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones right now in front of all of us.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:27.232]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[01:16:28.319 --> 01:16:35.768]  In fact, it came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[01:16:36.428 --> 01:16:37.730]  He was right under me on the list.
[01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:44.438]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson, that's why.
[01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:47.213]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:50.056]  I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:53.660]  He was already, obviously, covering all that on air.
[01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:58.005]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[01:16:58.565 --> 01:17:02.390]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:11.255]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:18.638]  In the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[01:17:19.439 --> 01:17:25.122]  But today we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the U.S.
[01:17:26.089 --> 01:17:41.182]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[01:17:42.503 --> 01:17:44.105]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[01:17:44.845 --> 01:17:49.729]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes unaccompanied.
[01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:53.493]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[01:17:54.835 --> 01:18:01.424]  If we go back to 10 years ago, seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about 8-9 million viewers a night.
[01:18:01.964 --> 01:18:03.967]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[01:18:04.327 --> 01:18:05.629]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:07.451]  And what was he talking about?
[01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:11.977]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[01:18:12.017 --> 01:18:13.159]  He was going off their own documents.
[01:18:14.349 --> 01:18:19.115]  Lou Dobbs was taken off the air because he was number one, because he was telling the truth that he was a patriot.
[01:18:19.296 --> 01:18:23.802]  Now he's relegated to Fox Business with maybe a million viewers.
[01:18:23.822 --> 01:18:26.405]  And Tucker Carlson is next, and then Sean Hannity.
[01:18:26.846 --> 01:18:29.769]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:36.315]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[01:18:36.876 --> 01:18:40.799]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[01:18:40.839 --> 01:18:44.782]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:47.685]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[01:18:48.285 --> 01:18:51.628]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:58.554]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:05.353]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[01:19:05.853 --> 01:19:11.636]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[01:19:11.696 --> 01:19:13.457]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas.
[01:19:13.737 --> 01:19:17.399]  Because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[01:19:18.686 --> 01:19:22.349]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[01:19:22.769 --> 01:19:26.792]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous.
[01:19:26.812 --> 01:19:33.698]  Where San Francisco jury is letting an illegal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white, we have to virtue signal.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.441]  This is the real cancer.
[01:19:36.241 --> 01:19:45.287]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds, gay bars, have little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:50.991]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:54.313]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[01:19:54.793 --> 01:19:56.834]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:19:57.014 --> 01:19:58.956]  Just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[01:20:06.337 --> 01:20:09.038]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:29.485]  Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:29.986]  Welcome back.
[01:20:30.006 --> 01:20:30.906]  Let's take a look at the wall.
[01:20:32.307 --> 01:20:35.649]  Because we're told that there's not any money for the wall.
[01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:37.630]  And I don't believe it.
[01:20:38.651 --> 01:20:39.752]  Mark Meadows doesn't believe it.
[01:20:39.792 --> 01:20:44.294]  He said we spend more money on sugar subsidies than we're asking for this.
[01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:50.338]  And when you look at the total amount, as I mentioned, we spend four trillion dollars on the budget.
[01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:55.821]  Five billion dollars is less than one-eighth of one percent.
[01:20:57.382 --> 01:21:01.725]  So if you've got a dollar to spend, that's one-eighth of a penny, if you want to think of it that way.
[01:21:02.481 --> 01:21:04.702]  But there's many other different ways that you can think about this.
[01:21:04.722 --> 01:21:15.288]  I mean, we've got, as Daily Caller points out, the government lost more money bailing out General Motors than is being asked for for the wall.
[01:21:15.308 --> 01:21:25.073]  According to a 2014 Special Inspector General report, American taxpayers took an $11.2 billion loss on its bailout of General Motors.
[01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:27.875]  That's more than twice as much as they're asking for the wall.
[01:21:28.742 --> 01:21:36.604]  After the automaker declared bankruptcy in 2009, the government invested $49.5 billion in the company with a 61% equity share.
[01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:42.206]  Over time, GM's stock price dropped and despite selling back shares, the U.S.
[01:21:42.226 --> 01:21:46.727]  government took these multi-billion dollar losses, over $11 billion.
[01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:51.509]  Now, of course, General Motors was bragging about the fact
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.283]  That they had paid back all that money with interest.
[01:21:55.784 --> 01:21:56.565]  And that was phony.
[01:21:56.685 --> 01:21:57.727]  They had a couple of different accounts.
[01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:01.872]  They had one that was a loan, and then they had another one that was an outright grant, which is what this is talking about.
[01:22:02.032 --> 01:22:06.518]  They've just basically moved the money from one place to the other and said, look, we paid you back.
[01:22:07.379 --> 01:22:11.404]  Kind of like what happened with the banks and the bailout system that we had with that.
[01:22:12.617 --> 01:22:20.759]  The Federal Reserve obligingly took the interest rates down to 0% so they could pay back all that money with 0% loans.
[01:22:20.839 --> 01:22:22.079]  They don't do that for you, do they?
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.180]  Oh, that's right, they don't.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:23.500]  Yeah.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.760]  Especially if you've got a credit card this time of year.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:35.243]  You're going to be paying probably anywhere from 15 to 25% interest and they may go up on that if they say that you represent a credit risk to them.
[01:22:36.027 --> 01:22:43.553]  Yeah, if somebody in your family gets sick and you have a health issue and they say, oh, your credit rating just went down, so we're going to go up on your credit card rate.
[01:22:44.473 --> 01:22:48.837]  Yeah, we do live in Potterville, don't we?
[01:22:49.517 --> 01:22:50.478]  Like it's a wonderful lie.
[01:22:50.798 --> 01:22:59.344]  And I think like George Bailey, we need to say we shouldn't have to go crawling to the Federal Reserve, crawling to Congress in order to live our lives or to grow our economy.
[01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.546]  And yet that's exactly what they're telling us.
[01:23:01.566 --> 01:23:04.168]  We're going to tell you why President Trump can and should fire
[01:23:05.987 --> 01:23:06.668]  The Fed Chair.
[01:23:07.588 --> 01:23:08.169]  In a little bit.
[01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:10.591]  But let's take a look at some of the other things that we've spent money on.
[01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:14.053]  We had the Big Dig.
[01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:14.734]  Remember that?
[01:23:14.894 --> 01:23:15.575]  Up in Boston?
[01:23:16.655 --> 01:23:22.320]  They had a very big project up there, as I point out in Daily Caller.
[01:23:23.641 --> 01:23:25.983]  It was Boston's primary thoroughfare.
[01:23:26.903 --> 01:23:27.624]  And they rerouted it.
[01:23:27.744 --> 01:23:29.325]  They had a lot of financial mismanagement.
[01:23:29.345 --> 01:23:30.626]  They had design flaws in it.
[01:23:31.287 --> 01:23:34.970]  The Federal Highway Administration stepped in and they gave them a bailout.
[01:23:36.172 --> 01:23:38.795]  They said we'll give you $7 billion in grants.
[01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:43.040]  But by the time it was completed in 2010, the total ticket price was $15 billion.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.101]  So we can build a
[01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:59.160]  A failed thoroughfare in Boston that has bad design and mismanagement, but we can't do it to our own wall.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:13.170]  Now I think the icing on the cake for me came when Jimmy Kimmel started making fun of the people who said, alright, Congress, we have voted multiple times for these sellouts like Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn.
[01:24:13.911 --> 01:24:17.635]  Who refused to pass the money just a little bit of this.
[01:24:18.196 --> 01:24:23.822]  I mean, we're talking about a situation where it's 215 miles is all.
[01:24:24.122 --> 01:24:26.444]  And half of that has already got a fence there.
[01:24:26.464 --> 01:24:27.926]  They'll be rebuilding that fence.
[01:24:27.946 --> 01:24:32.010]  You know that works out to 23 million dollars a mile?
[01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:34.592]  It's one of the reasons why we can't get anything done.
[01:24:35.172 --> 01:24:38.675]  You look at what happened in the big dig in Boston and so forth.
[01:24:38.936 --> 01:24:42.279]  If we were to try to build an interstate system today, we couldn't do it.
[01:24:42.339 --> 01:24:42.919]  Why is that?
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.425]  Have we forgotten the technology that is necessary to build something as simple as a road?
[01:24:49.646 --> 01:24:53.229]  And I say as simple as a road because somehow we can in all of our cities.
[01:24:53.269 --> 01:24:54.410]  We can build houses.
[01:24:55.051 --> 01:24:56.652]  We can build skyscrapers.
[01:24:57.602 --> 01:25:01.644]  But we can't figure out how to build simple things like roads and walls.
[01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:03.464]  They're just too expensive.
[01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:10.127]  We overthink, we over-engineer, and we over-spend on everything that the federal government does.
[01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:10.748]  And why is that?
[01:25:10.948 --> 01:25:13.009]  Why do they spend so much more money today?
[01:25:13.389 --> 01:25:15.810]  Well, it's because of the bidding system.
[01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:18.151]  It's because of the inherent corruption in the system.
[01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:25.454]  These projects, these infrastructure projects, we can't get anything built because it is so bloated and corrupt.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.102]  This is why you got situations like Elon Musk with a boring project that he's got where he goes underground with it.
[01:25:33.203 --> 01:25:34.383]  It's basically a good idea.
[01:25:34.443 --> 01:25:41.846]  What I don't like about it is that Elon Musk's business model and his engineering idea is a great idea, quite frankly.
[01:25:42.907 --> 01:25:51.210]  But his business model is always based on government subsidies from you and I and on monopolies.
[01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:58.267]  And as you saw, the CBS reporter driving through that tunnel with them, and she was all excited about, oh, look at how fast this thing is going.
[01:25:58.307 --> 01:26:01.011]  It seemed real fast to her because it was very enclosed.
[01:26:01.051 --> 01:26:02.873]  They were only going 15, 20 miles an hour.
[01:26:05.287 --> 01:26:10.350]  But as she's talking to him, he said, well, you're going to have to have this on autopilot to make sure you don't collide with others.
[01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:12.311]  So all the cars will have to have my autopilot.
[01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.012]  She didn't follow up on that.
[01:26:14.032 --> 01:26:20.135]  So this is something only for people who buy your Tesla cars, right?
[01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.036]  So everybody buy a Tesla car.
[01:26:22.056 --> 01:26:26.478]  Or you'd have to buy some kind of, I guess, an add-on system or something that worked with an equivalent car.
[01:26:27.339 --> 01:26:28.979]  So you'd have to buy into his operating system.
[01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:29.800]  He's going to own that.
[01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:37.055]  You have to have something like that, because you have to go vertical, as he pointed out.
[01:26:37.075 --> 01:26:42.761]  He said, look, we're traveling in a two-dimensional space, but we're living in a three-dimensional space.
[01:26:43.562 --> 01:26:49.388]  And the cities, they can't build the roads out, and they couldn't build the buildings out either, so they built the buildings higher and higher.
[01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:52.050]  But they won't build the roads higher and higher.
[01:26:52.858 --> 01:26:54.459]  That's what he's talking about, a two-dimensional space.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:03.508]  If you go back and you look at envisioning the future that they would have back in the 20s and 30s, the early movies of that, they would show skyscrapers everywhere.
[01:27:03.588 --> 01:27:04.709]  Oh yeah, we got the skyscrapers.
[01:27:04.749 --> 01:27:10.114]  And then they would show multiple layers of roads, which they never built.
[01:27:10.674 --> 01:27:11.715]  They forgot to do that.
[01:27:12.216 --> 01:27:13.196]  They didn't want to do that.
[01:27:14.113 --> 01:27:15.493]  It got too expensive, too corrupt.
[01:27:15.733 --> 01:27:23.475]  The only transportation infrastructure we're going to have now is going to be funded by billionaires who then have monopoly control of our system.
[01:27:23.635 --> 01:27:26.515]  The government no longer wants to provide infrastructure.
[01:27:27.376 --> 01:27:31.176]  Just like we see with this attitude about the border.
[01:27:31.356 --> 01:27:33.457]  They don't want to do anything to serve us.
[01:27:33.677 --> 01:27:36.257]  It's all self-serving about their interests.
[01:27:37.537 --> 01:27:39.618]  And they will let the billionaires
[01:27:40.612 --> 01:27:40.952]  I think so.
[01:28:02.833 --> 01:28:03.934]  Makes perfectly good sense.
[01:28:04.755 --> 01:28:14.507]  But it is a fascist economic model, where the government becomes increasingly more of a police state, a surveillance state, not interested with building infrastructure.
[01:28:15.288 --> 01:28:21.696]  That will be owned and built by their crony capitalist friends, like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.
[01:28:23.115 --> 01:28:24.516]  That's the sad part about that.
[01:28:24.556 --> 01:28:25.437]  But getting back to the wall.
[01:28:25.957 --> 01:28:27.359]  Getting back to what Jimmy Kimmel did.
[01:28:27.599 --> 01:28:28.800]  We've got a clip of Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.581]  We're going to play that for you when we come back.
[01:28:30.721 --> 01:28:32.202]  I went a little bit long on this.
[01:28:32.282 --> 01:28:39.008]  And then we're also going to talk about why we should and could, President Trump could, end the Federal Reserve.
[01:28:39.028 --> 01:28:39.428]  Stay with us.
[01:28:39.728 --> 01:28:40.289]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:45.268 --> 01:28:49.418]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.663]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:29:11.021 --> 01:29:18.033]  If you study why Infowars is public enemy number one for the globalists, you understand why they're panicking.
[01:29:18.053 --> 01:29:20.037]  You understand what they're scared of.
[01:29:20.117 --> 01:29:21.439]  They're scared of nationalism.
[01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:23.723]  They're scared of patriotism.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.043]  They are scared of people that will stand up for their sovereignty and who are territorial.
[01:29:29.783 --> 01:29:45.133]  Because we have these multinational corporations that have slave factories, literal concentration camps in China, like Apple and others, who see us as weak and stupid, and they have this whole leftist ideology that's meant to basically weaken us and divide and conquer us, but it's not working anymore.
[01:29:45.594 --> 01:29:51.818]  And the globalists have been able to track back where the main resistance in the last 20 years came from,
[01:29:52.438 --> 01:30:03.141]  And that main resistance has been my syndicated radio show, the documentary films we've made that have been seen hundreds of millions of times, and the other news operations that we've set up.
[01:30:03.681 --> 01:30:14.184]  And that's why we're under such attack, and that's why we can't give up in the face of the globalist onslaught, because we've already launched the Americana movement, the new renaissance, 1776, worldwide.
[01:30:14.504 --> 01:30:15.184]  It's happening!
[01:30:15.585 --> 01:30:16.825]  This isn't a hoax!
[01:30:17.085 --> 01:30:18.125]  This isn't hype!
[01:30:18.505 --> 01:30:19.726]  Infowars is real!
[01:30:20.697 --> 01:30:30.286]  That's why the enemy media is always saying we're a hoax, or always saying we're fake, or always saying we're a fraud, because they don't know how to counter something that's the opposite of them.
[01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:35.091]  When they say we're a hoax or a fraud, they're talking about themselves.
[01:30:35.451 --> 01:30:38.494]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can see us here in one of our new state-of-the-art studios.
[01:30:39.114 --> 01:30:40.896]  I was planning by the end of 2018 to be 24 hours a day live.
[01:30:42.998 --> 01:30:43.678]  On radio and TV.
[01:30:43.718 --> 01:30:49.239]  And we only launched two new shows in 2018, CounterThink and The War Room, and they do a great job.
[01:30:49.379 --> 01:30:52.560]  We also, right before that started, launched The Real News with David Knight.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:31:00.942]  And we've expanded in the face of the attacks, but I really, in the next three or four months, want to be able to go at least 20 hours a day live by the spring.
[01:31:01.062 --> 01:31:08.244]  And that's going to take major support by you, the audience, to get around the censorship, to get around the boycotts, to get around, you know, the globalist lawsuits.
[01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:09.324]  And you've been doing it
[01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:11.143]  So far.
[01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:12.525]  But I need your prayers.
[01:31:12.685 --> 01:31:13.445]  I need your support.
[01:31:13.505 --> 01:31:16.207]  I need your word of mouth that's unstoppable and overrides the censors.
[01:31:16.648 --> 01:31:29.697]  And I need you to go to infowarestore.com as we go into the new year where I'm going to extend all the Christmas specials that were the biggest in our history to sell out of all of our products so we don't have to pay inventory tax by January 1st.
[01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:30.498]  Everything is
[01:31:30.538 --> 01:31:32.521]  We've got new shipments coming in in February.
[01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:36.025]  We're going to be sold out of a lot of products until February because folks have been coming through.
[01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:38.689]  But a lot of these products we're selling at below cost.
[01:31:38.729 --> 01:31:45.798]  You get store-wide free shipping, a free t-shirt, 50 to 75% off, and double Patriot points on your next order to the 5%, 10% on each dollar.
[01:31:46.479 --> 01:31:55.487]  These are our biggest deals ever because we're also coming online with a new sponsorship model to augment our sales direct so there's no way the globalists can shut us down.
[01:31:55.567 --> 01:31:57.608]  We aren't just going to continue to fight.
[01:31:57.769 --> 01:32:01.632]  We're going to win thanks to your steadfast prayer and financial support.
[01:32:01.752 --> 01:32:03.593]  So again, the three pillars of this.
[01:32:04.634 --> 01:32:05.195]  Praying to God.
[01:32:06.567 --> 01:32:10.368]  Spreading the word about the articles and videos and taking action, or doing your own show, or doing both.
[01:32:10.889 --> 01:32:13.450]  And then of course, ladies and gentlemen, financial support.
[01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:14.610]  That's a three-legged stool.
[01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:22.133]  You can also add reaching out to local radio and TV stations, thanking them, thanking their sponsors, becoming a sponsor.
[01:32:22.513 --> 01:32:26.314]  As Christians and conservatives and nationalists, we're quiet people that are confident.
[01:32:26.634 --> 01:32:27.715]  We're not like leftist bullies.
[01:32:28.575 --> 01:32:29.695]  You don't have to bully anybody.
[01:32:29.735 --> 01:32:31.376]  You've just got to have your voice be heard.
[01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:40.097]  So, all the Christmas specials that we have are all extended until products sell out right through until January 1st, 2019.
[01:32:40.497 --> 01:32:43.218]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site for everything.
[01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:45.358]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[01:32:45.398 --> 01:32:46.638]  These are amazing products.
[01:32:46.938 --> 01:32:47.919]  Take advantage of them today.
[01:32:47.959 --> 01:32:50.379]  And to all the listeners that have been supporting us for years, thank you.
[01:32:50.819 --> 01:32:52.579]  What we've done to the globalists is thanks to you.
[01:32:52.879 --> 01:32:54.100]  You are the Infowar.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320]  You are the resistance.
[01:33:06.335 --> 01:33:10.418]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.424 --> 01:33:23.705]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:23.745 --> 01:33:25.947]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:26.307 --> 01:33:29.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.009 --> 01:33:32.811]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:33:37.717 --> 01:33:38.218]  Welcome back.
[01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:44.103]  You know, on Thursday we had Jimmy Kimmel along with Stephen Colbert.
[01:33:44.143 --> 01:33:49.648]  He seems to be, these two guys, are the Democrat Party's court jesters.
[01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:56.253]  And they're not really funny, but they are partisan and they are weaponized propaganda.
[01:33:57.254 --> 01:34:00.457]  They follow the rules for radicals set up by Saul Alinsky.
[01:34:00.517 --> 01:34:02.959]  One of those rules was that ridicule
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.125]  is the most powerful way to attack somebody, because as Alinsky said, there's no answer to it.
[01:34:09.906 --> 01:34:11.527]  So what you do is you ridicule people.
[01:34:12.428 --> 01:34:16.131]  And Jimmy Kimmel was ridiculing the people who wanted to have the wall built.
[01:34:16.171 --> 01:34:23.178]  You know, we have had multiple elections where we've had people like Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn tell us, yeah, we're going to protect the border.
[01:34:23.919 --> 01:34:24.459]  That's what we're about.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:33.567]  Or Paul Ryan, even though we know that Paul Ryan's been open borders all of his political career, he'll still campaign on getting control of immigration.
[01:34:35.148 --> 01:34:38.050]  And they lie to us, time and time again.
[01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:47.798]  And then we have the Supreme Court coming up with more rulings on Friday, saying that President Trump cannot stop illegal aliens at the border.
[01:34:47.818 --> 01:34:50.861]  The only thing that's going to stop them, folks, is some kind of a physical barrier.
[01:34:51.929 --> 01:35:03.217]  So the American people, especially one individual, Brian Kolfagi, I think is the way you pronounce his name, he was the triple amputee, lost three limbs in Iraq.
[01:35:04.418 --> 01:35:10.002]  And he had a conservative blog or some kind of publication on Facebook.
[01:35:11.152 --> 01:35:13.994]  And they had encouraged him to spend money promoting it.
[01:35:14.034 --> 01:35:20.339]  He had spent over $300,000 at Facebook's urging to promote his conservative organization.
[01:35:20.359 --> 01:35:22.641]  And then they just terminated him without any explanation.
[01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:23.621]  Well, he's back.
[01:35:24.482 --> 01:35:26.103]  And he's back with his GoFundMe campaign.
[01:35:26.123 --> 01:35:28.425]  He wants to raise a billion dollars for the wall.
[01:35:28.865 --> 01:35:31.587]  And people who voted for it are willing to pay for it as well.
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:33.288]  And so Jimmy Kimmel can't ignore that.
[01:35:33.348 --> 01:35:34.089]  It's gotten too big.
[01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:39.453]  First time I saw this, I printed out an article from the preceding evening, and it was $400,000.
[01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:47.773]  And then the next day I was reporting on it and I was on air and the crew came on and said, no, that's actually 4 million now.
[01:35:47.793 --> 01:35:48.474]  I was like, what?
[01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:51.335]  It grew by a factor of 10 in like 12 hours?
[01:35:52.435 --> 01:35:56.396]  And then by the afternoon, we had a story that went up at Infowars.com.
[01:35:56.436 --> 01:35:58.237]  It was up to 5 at that point.
[01:35:59.257 --> 01:36:00.558]  The next day it was up to 10.
[01:36:00.678 --> 01:36:02.158]  Now it is up to 16.2 million.
[01:36:02.178 --> 01:36:03.399]  It grew $100,000 just in the last hour.
[01:36:03.419 --> 01:36:04.999]  So it can't be ignored.
[01:36:10.202 --> 01:36:12.004]  So what are they going to do to try to stop it?
[01:36:12.064 --> 01:36:13.525]  They're going to ridicule it.
[01:36:13.605 --> 01:36:16.908]  They're going to use clowns like Jimmy Kimmel, who said this.
[01:36:17.929 --> 01:36:29.198]  He said the twist in all of this, and the government shut down and so forth, is that the president might not need Mexico or Congress to pay for the wall at all, because there's some very dopey people ready to pay for it themselves.
[01:36:30.399 --> 01:36:33.742]  And he talks about the GoFundMe campaign to the point he was mocking it.
[01:36:34.992 --> 01:36:40.715]  It was only $9 million, but he said, a more useful thing to do with your money would be to go outside and feed it to a bird.
[01:36:41.475 --> 01:36:43.796]  But you do have to admire the sacrifice that they're making.
[01:36:43.836 --> 01:36:48.199]  I mean, a lot of these people are dipping into their meth money for this.
[01:36:49.619 --> 01:36:54.222]  And on top of all that, Trump's Secretary of Defense, General Mattis, surprised everyone and resigned today, is what he said.
[01:36:54.282 --> 01:36:57.904]  So, that is Jimmy Kimmel's take on all this.
[01:36:58.304 --> 01:37:03.686]  Now, Ted Cruz is saying President Trump is not going to capitulate over this $5 billion demand.
[01:37:05.468 --> 01:37:19.852]  As I said before, the sad thing about this is that with the inefficiency, the corruption, and the overspending and overengineering that is endemic to our government anymore, it's basically paralyzed when it comes to infrastructure.
[01:37:20.172 --> 01:37:32.955]  We can't build the infrastructure, not only because we're spending so much money to destroy the infrastructure of other countries and undeclared wars, and rebuilding their infrastructure before we build ours, but it's also because we are so grossly inefficient at what we do.
[01:37:33.035 --> 01:37:34.015]  I seriously doubt
[01:37:35.145 --> 01:37:41.746]  That if we go in and try to rebuild some of the infrastructure in Iraq or Afghanistan that we're paying the kind of money that we're paying for this wall.
[01:37:41.986 --> 01:37:43.047]  $23 million a mile.
[01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:44.247]  I seriously doubt that.
[01:37:45.947 --> 01:37:47.828]  But there is no support.
[01:37:47.848 --> 01:37:51.689]  The reason we have this GoFundMe campaign is because look at what the Republicans in Congress did.
[01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:53.329]  People like Mitch McConnell.
[01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:56.810]  As the Dallas News was pointing out on Friday, they said 60 senators
[01:37:59.299 --> 01:38:03.000]  Uh, do not support the so-called nuclear option, they said.
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:05.201]  Uh, including Mitch McConnell.
[01:38:05.561 --> 01:38:07.161]  Well, I don't know that it's 60 senators.
[01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:09.962]  That is the nuclear option rule is 60 senators.
[01:38:10.662 --> 01:38:11.722]  I don't think they had a head count.
[01:38:12.743 --> 01:38:19.625]  Because you got the majority whip, John Cornyn, of Texas, where a vast majority of these people are coming in.
[01:38:19.965 --> 01:38:21.365]  Doesn't want to protect Texas.
[01:38:22.325 --> 01:38:24.286]  He wants to protect Washington.
[01:38:25.168 --> 01:38:31.889]  See, John Cornyn would like to keep the Washington government that doesn't care about this existential threat to our country.
[01:38:32.069 --> 01:38:33.589]  He wants to keep Washington going.
[01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:36.930]  Let's open Washington and keep the border open at the same time.
[01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:38.410]  We're not going to... Well, close them both.
[01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:47.292]  John Cornyn said Trump's demand to end the filibuster reflects, quote, a desire for immediate gratification without regard for long-term consequences.
[01:38:47.592 --> 01:38:49.352]  In other words, Trump's a baby.
[01:38:49.432 --> 01:38:51.473]  Trump wants it right now, says John Cornyn.
[01:38:51.513 --> 01:38:53.413]  Remember that, Republicans of Texas.
[01:38:54.423 --> 01:38:55.104]  I'll remember that.
[01:38:56.345 --> 01:39:05.152]  He was also mocking President Trump on other issues about the border, as well as foreign policy issues.
[01:39:05.192 --> 01:39:05.773]  John Cornyn.
[01:39:07.814 --> 01:39:09.976]  It's just absolutely amazing to see these people.
[01:39:10.036 --> 01:39:14.760]  And of course, he's joined in all of this by people like Lamar Alexander and Jeff Flake.
[01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:17.042]  I'm glad to see these people going.
[01:39:19.464 --> 01:39:22.467]  It's about time that we see very clearly
[01:39:23.584 --> 01:39:27.945]  The people of the Republican Party who don't want this country to continue.
[01:39:28.985 --> 01:39:31.985]  Mark Meadows said we spend more money on sugar subsidies.
[01:39:32.386 --> 01:39:36.746]  I find it just incomprehensible that we can't secure our nation.
[01:39:37.226 --> 01:39:39.207]  It's time we put this on President Trump's desk.
[01:39:39.287 --> 01:39:40.327]  And they did, in the House.
[01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.567]  Basically because of Mark Meadows.
[01:39:43.267 --> 01:39:46.788]  It wasn't going to be brought up by Paul Ryan, but it was Mark Meadows going to President Trump.
[01:39:46.988 --> 01:39:48.148]  And they did take it to a vote.
[01:39:48.188 --> 01:39:48.868]  They did pass it.
[01:39:48.888 --> 01:39:51.489]  But of course, Mitch McConnell shut it down.
[01:39:52.990 --> 01:40:08.614]  And so as we, the other thing that happened on Friday, later on Friday, we had the Supreme Court, you had John Roberts joining the liberal colleagues on Friday to rule that President Trump cannot stop illegal alien invasion, as the New American pointed out.
[01:40:08.654 --> 01:40:13.855]  In a two-sentence order, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by Bush,
[01:40:15.172 --> 01:40:18.894]  The man who twice helped to rescue Obamacare, that's unconstitutional.
[01:40:19.474 --> 01:40:24.376]  The court blocked the administration's attempt to stop illegal aliens from simply claiming asylum.
[01:40:25.076 --> 01:40:28.838]  Now, any illegal alien who crosses a border can apply for asylum and the U.S.
[01:40:28.858 --> 01:40:30.518]  government can't refuse to hear his case.
[01:40:31.819 --> 01:40:38.121]  And so this is why you have to have a physical border to keep that from happening, to keep them in their country.
[01:40:38.341 --> 01:40:41.703]  That's why using the military to keep them in their country
[01:40:42.774 --> 01:40:45.055]  is not a violation of posse comitatus.
[01:40:45.956 --> 01:40:51.038]  It is a violation of the promise to defend our country not to use the military to do this.
[01:40:51.739 --> 01:40:55.181]  You're keeping foreign citizens in their country.
[01:40:55.261 --> 01:40:57.042]  You're keeping them from entering the country.
[01:40:57.242 --> 01:41:02.685]  You're not using the military for law enforcement against American citizens inside the country.
[01:41:02.865 --> 01:41:04.786]  You're keeping them from coming into the country.
[01:41:06.716 --> 01:41:09.597]  That is the very thing that the military should be used for.
[01:41:09.958 --> 01:41:11.238]  And as they point out, New American.
[01:41:11.498 --> 01:41:15.840]  So here's a message to 158 million people in the world who want to immigrate to the U.S.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:16.480]  The door is open.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.101]  Come on in.
[01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:18.881]  We know this.
[01:41:19.062 --> 01:41:19.342]  Why?
[01:41:19.462 --> 01:41:22.703]  Because we had a Gallup survey.
[01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:24.264]  Went over a couple of years.
[01:41:24.424 --> 01:41:26.525]  Went over 150 different countries.
[01:41:27.105 --> 01:41:31.787]  They found 750 million people who want to change nationalities.
[01:41:32.667 --> 01:41:33.208]  They are
[01:41:34.561 --> 01:41:35.661]  Trans citizens.
[01:41:35.761 --> 01:41:38.402]  They identify as being a citizen of another country, therefore they are.
[01:41:39.903 --> 01:41:44.544]  And we had more than three times as many people want to come to this country.
[01:41:44.904 --> 01:41:47.064]  158 million people said, yeah, I think I'd like to go to America.
[01:41:47.745 --> 01:41:50.445]  They had under 50 million say they'd like to go to Canada.
[01:41:50.465 --> 01:41:56.267]  That was the number two destination of all of these transient trans citizens that are out there.
[01:41:57.327 --> 01:41:59.629]  And so, they're not making this up.
[01:41:59.969 --> 01:42:03.392]  That's 158 million people who told Gallup that they want to come to America.
[01:42:03.732 --> 01:42:04.092]  Why not?
[01:42:05.113 --> 01:42:07.695]  We've got a big welfare magnet to take care of them.
[01:42:07.735 --> 01:42:11.738]  And we've got a Supreme Court that says that President Trump can't stop that.
[01:42:11.798 --> 01:42:26.649]  Now, President Trump needs to understand, as he's taking on the presidential mantle this week, he needs to understand that he has the authority under the Constitution to do this and they can't stop him from doing that.
[01:42:27.786 --> 01:42:36.374]  We have the example of Andrew Jackson who told the Supreme Court, you've made your decision, let's see you enforce it.
[01:42:36.994 --> 01:42:42.219]  And that's what President Trump needs to tell the Supreme Court and especially all of these federal judges.
[01:42:42.259 --> 01:42:49.785]  There's absolutely nothing in the Constitution that gives every single federal judge the power of veto.
[01:42:50.826 --> 01:42:57.353]  To stop the president from doing his constitutionally delegated, specifically delegated power to protect our borders.
[01:42:57.774 --> 01:42:58.434]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.454 --> 01:42:58.795]  Stay with us.
[01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:04.843]  Infowars has changed the world.
[01:43:05.884 --> 01:43:08.907]  Our audience, by supporting us, have truly been in the arena.
[01:43:09.367 --> 01:43:12.651]  That means if you're old, it means if you're young, it means if you're black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:13.411 --> 01:43:25.664]  If you love freedom, and you love justice, and you believe in free market capitalism, and you believe in the Christian ethos, and you believe in Western civilization, and you believe in progress, then you are the man and woman in the arena, and I salute you
[01:43:26.204 --> 01:43:27.265]  As we prepare to close out 2018.
[01:43:28.946 --> 01:43:41.414]  I knew that when they deplatformed us in a massive, draconian, concerted, racketeering operation four and a half months ago, that it was about removing Trump's populist nationalist support base.
[01:43:41.894 --> 01:43:43.355]  The people's support base for him.
[01:43:45.026 --> 01:43:51.650]  And now we see, in just the last few weeks, Michael Savage is having his show cancelled from three hours to one hour, even though it has record ratings.
[01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:56.193]  And Ben Shapiro, never been in talk radio, is being given his show, given his audience.
[01:43:57.134 --> 01:44:02.317]  We see Gab McGinnis being taken off the air for being number one on CRTV, better than Glenn Beck, and others.
[01:44:03.057 --> 01:44:13.224]  Anyone who truly connects with the people and who doesn't apologize for America, from our president to yours truly, is being demonized, being sued, being attacked, being taken off the air.
[01:44:14.608 --> 01:44:20.410]  The globalists are really upset now because they threw everything they had at us in the last few years.
[01:44:20.970 --> 01:44:25.972]  The shadow banning and the lawsuits, the lies, the attacks, the boycotting of our sponsors, and it didn't work.
[01:44:27.232 --> 01:44:35.095]  So now with the deplatforming, we're on talk radio, we're on local TV stations, and we're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com with bigger than ever audiences.
[01:44:36.351 --> 01:44:37.152]  On those platforms.
[01:44:37.332 --> 01:44:41.856]  InfoWars has two or three times the audience ever had, but that's on InfoWars.
[01:44:42.436 --> 01:44:44.738]  It cuts our reach, though, to other platforms.
[01:44:45.499 --> 01:44:46.460]  And that's where you come in.
[01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:55.008]  Now, about two weeks ago, George Soros Media Matters funded Combine, directed by U.S.
[01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:57.370]  intelligence agencies that aren't following Trump's directives.
[01:44:59.096 --> 01:45:09.398]  He legally began launching operations to lie about Infowars and things we've said and done, and to contact radio stations across the country that we're on and say, Alex Jones is fake news.
[01:45:10.339 --> 01:45:11.399]  Alex Jones is fiction.
[01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:13.059]  Announce it's fiction.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.060]  In an attempt to have those stations kick us off the air.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:23.722]  And they misquote statements from 2013, 2015 and say, he's still doing all this, take him off the air.
[01:45:24.997 --> 01:45:28.679]  We're talking about digital Nazis, or digital communists.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.582]  Digital authoritarianism is really the proper term.
[01:45:33.263 --> 01:45:35.644]  And they're doing this because they can't beat us.
[01:45:36.104 --> 01:45:46.852]  And they know from Brazil, to Germany, to the United Kingdom, to Russia, to Italy, to all over the world, nationalist and populist free market candidates are getting elected.
[01:45:47.592 --> 01:45:53.456]  People are aware of the one world government plan to abolish our borders, to abolish our families, to make us debt slaves.
[01:45:53.496 --> 01:45:54.217]  And they're saying no.
[01:45:55.177 --> 01:45:55.859]  That's positive.
[01:45:55.899 --> 01:45:57.181]  We're winning overall globally.
[01:45:57.421 --> 01:45:58.964]  Humanity's coming back from the dead, but...
[01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:05.825]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:46:05.885 --> 01:46:07.125]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:46:07.846 --> 01:46:27.052]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[01:46:28.442 --> 01:46:34.186]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[01:46:34.686 --> 01:46:39.730]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[01:46:40.351 --> 01:46:42.412]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[01:46:42.832 --> 01:46:43.893]  Every order gets free shipping.
[01:46:43.973 --> 01:46:46.775]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[01:46:47.175 --> 01:46:55.842]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[01:46:56.502 --> 01:46:58.204]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:46:58.484 --> 01:46:59.265]  I salute you all.
[01:46:59.426 --> 01:47:01.869]  Now please take action at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:05.793 --> 01:47:08.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.136 --> 01:47:27.737]  Welcome back.
[01:47:28.177 --> 01:47:32.322]  Before we get into why President Trump should, of course, fire
[01:47:33.641 --> 01:47:40.745]  The Fed's Chair Powell and how he has the authority to do that before we get into that and take a look at what's really involved here.
[01:47:40.985 --> 01:47:47.669]  And I also want to talk about LeBron James' comment about the old white NFL owners have a slave mentality.
[01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:50.371]  I'm going to tell you who the real slaves in this equation are.
[01:47:50.491 --> 01:47:52.512]  It's not the millionaire players out there, of course.
[01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:53.692]  A lot of people have made that point.
[01:47:54.293 --> 01:48:00.296]  But they haven't really talked about who the people are who are really enslaved by these professional sports teams.
[01:48:00.736 --> 01:48:01.297]  I'll give you a couple.
[01:48:02.077 --> 01:48:03.479]  Seconds to think about who that is.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:09.766]  But before we get to that, before we talk about the Fed, I just want to remind you of the sales that we have at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:48:10.487 --> 01:48:17.455]  We have brought back all of our 12 Days of Christmas specials, the 24-hour specials that we had, just like the song.
[01:48:17.955 --> 01:48:18.516]  They're all there.
[01:48:18.916 --> 01:48:22.721]  And we've got discounts from 50 to 60% on those specials.
[01:48:22.961 --> 01:48:26.565]  We have some things that are 75% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:31.652]  We're trying to clear the inventory because there's a very large inventory tax here in Texas.
[01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:33.153]  We want to get that done before the end of the year.
[01:48:33.654 --> 01:48:35.116]  So we've got massive discounts.
[01:48:35.156 --> 01:48:37.078]  We have free shipping storewide.
[01:48:37.839 --> 01:48:39.080]  We have double Patriot points.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:43.602]  Of course, that's our award system so that you can get discounts on future purchases.
[01:48:44.042 --> 01:48:45.563]  And you get a free t-shirt with every order.
[01:48:45.743 --> 01:48:46.063]  All of that.
[01:48:46.123 --> 01:48:54.427]  Free shipping, double Patriot points, free t-shirt with every order, and 50 to 75% off the items that are at the store.
[01:48:54.447 --> 01:48:56.729]  So take a look at what we've got at InfoWarsStore.com, folks.
[01:48:56.749 --> 01:49:05.133]  This is a great opportunity to support InfoWars, to support the First Amendment, to support your health and preparedness and that of your family.
[01:49:05.902 --> 01:49:18.932]  A lot of the things that we give at Christmas time are things just for momentary fun, but as we look at the new year and as people start to think about their health, this is a good time to educate your friends and family about how important it is to take care of their health.
[01:49:19.032 --> 01:49:22.475]  We have a lot of very good natural products that will help you with that.
[01:49:23.134 --> 01:49:25.755]  Let's take a look quickly now about this Fed issue.
[01:49:25.775 --> 01:49:34.798]  Of course, we had President Trump, as Bloomberg was reporting over the weekend, had discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
[01:49:35.658 --> 01:49:38.519]  Four people familiar with the matter said, yeah, he's talking about this.
[01:49:38.999 --> 01:49:48.082]  This isn't something that just came up, but this is something that was talked about more this week than it has been in the past.
[01:49:48.182 --> 01:49:48.482]  Why?
[01:49:48.662 --> 01:49:50.843]  Because we've got the Federal Reserve under Powell.
[01:49:51.630 --> 01:49:54.401]  Raising interest rates yet again with a shaky stock market.
[01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:59.490]  With housing markets across the country in very difficult situations.
[01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:06.412]  We've had a lot of markets where, like in the Las Vegas market, they had over 7,000 homes that didn't get a single offer.
[01:50:06.992 --> 01:50:08.293]  This is pretty much unprecedented.
[01:50:08.653 --> 01:50:11.954]  But we have reports of slowing markets all the way across the country.
[01:50:12.234 --> 01:50:16.315]  Dallas, New York, Florida, Las Vegas, other places.
[01:50:16.915 --> 01:50:18.415]  It's getting shaky.
[01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:22.997]  And then you have the Federal Reserve coming in and say, well, yeah, we're going to raise interest rates and I'm not going to stop.
[01:50:23.037 --> 01:50:24.137]  I'm going to do more of it next year.
[01:50:26.062 --> 01:50:29.145]  And now we have them trying to walk this back.
[01:50:29.865 --> 01:50:37.871]  Even though they said that the president has talked privately, according to people that were familiar with the matter, four people they had talked to, Bloomberg said.
[01:50:38.612 --> 01:50:42.255]  He talked privately about firing Powell many times the past few days, said two of the people.
[01:50:43.135 --> 01:50:52.903]  They said any attempt by Trump to push out Powell would have a devastating ripple, undermining investors' confidence in the central bank's ability to shepherd the economy without political interference.
[01:50:52.963 --> 01:50:53.283]  Come on.
[01:50:53.904 --> 01:50:55.385]  Seriously, you think the Federal Reserve
[01:50:56.539 --> 01:50:58.180]  Is it interfering with our economy?
[01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:00.862]  You've got a lot of confidence in the Federal Reserve after what they did?
[01:51:00.883 --> 01:51:07.648]  You've got a lot of economists saying if they raised interest rates before they did, they'd all be fired for malpractice.
[01:51:08.609 --> 01:51:10.510]  And then they go on to say this in the Bloomberg article.
[01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:13.813]  It's unclear how much legal authority the president has to fire Powell.
[01:51:13.913 --> 01:51:14.373]  No, it's not.
[01:51:15.354 --> 01:51:20.078]  The Federal Reserve Act says that governors may be removed for cause by the president.
[01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:24.895]  And then they go on to whine about the separation of politics from monetary policy.
[01:51:24.915 --> 01:51:28.796]  You know, this wall of separation, like we have church and state or something, which is not in the Constitution.
[01:51:29.776 --> 01:51:35.037]  And when Jefferson said that, he meant a wall around the government to keep them out of the church, not the other way around.
[01:51:35.517 --> 01:51:46.540]  Nevertheless, the separation of politics from monetary policy is supposed to instill confidence that Fed officials will do what's right for the economy on the long term, rather than bend to the short-term whims of a politician.
[01:51:48.004 --> 01:51:52.805]  So, how have they been doing in terms of managing the economy, folks?
[01:51:54.026 --> 01:51:56.367]  I mean, look at the Great Recession that we had 10 years ago.
[01:51:57.347 --> 01:52:00.048]  And then they turned around and did exactly the same thing again.
[01:52:01.228 --> 01:52:06.129]  China is allowed to have 10% a year growth for 40 years.
[01:52:06.150 --> 01:52:07.330]  They were just bragging about that.
[01:52:08.134 --> 01:52:17.038]  This last week, we had President Xi saying, look at this, after Deng instituted his reforms, we've had 9.5% per year growth in China.
[01:52:17.458 --> 01:52:23.961]  But here in America, according to the Fed and according to all these experts on Wall Street and Bloomberg, we are going to melt down.
[01:52:24.001 --> 01:52:29.184]  We're going to have uncontrolled inflation if we have more than 2 or 3% growth.
[01:52:30.064 --> 01:52:33.186]  If we get more than that, the Fed has to throttle down the economy.
[01:52:34.235 --> 01:52:36.638]  Except that there's already signs that it's been throttled.
[01:52:36.698 --> 01:52:37.359]  Maybe too much.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:39.302]  And they still continue to raise interest rates.
[01:52:39.562 --> 01:52:41.224]  But why is it that China gets a pass?
[01:52:41.465 --> 01:52:46.011]  Why is it that China can grow three to four times as fast as we can?
[01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:52.371]  In the same way that they're allowed to have tariffs that are ten times what our tariffs are on their products coming into our country.
[01:52:52.391 --> 01:52:59.052]  And when President Trump says, alright, you're going to either lower those tariffs or I'm going to raise our tariffs to your level, they say, look at what Trump is doing!
[01:52:59.652 --> 01:53:00.352]  This is terrible!
[01:53:00.892 --> 01:53:04.893]  He's going to destroy this country because he's raising tariffs up to the level the Chinese have.
[01:53:04.913 --> 01:53:07.634]  Well, if you don't like high tariffs, then why do you like them when China does it?
[01:53:08.754 --> 01:53:11.574]  If you don't like high growth, why do you allow China to have it?
[01:53:11.614 --> 01:53:15.215]  It's because the Federal Reserve and these globalists don't care about America.
[01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:19.531]  And I think that we have to come crawling to them for permission.
[01:53:20.892 --> 01:53:22.954]  I said this the day after the election.
[01:53:24.055 --> 01:53:27.037]  People were talking already about whether or not Trump would fire Janet Yellen.
[01:53:28.077 --> 01:53:28.978]  Wall Street was writing stuff.
[01:53:28.998 --> 01:53:30.439]  They said, oh, no, he's not going to do that.
[01:53:30.459 --> 01:53:32.080]  We've got to keep the Fed independent.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.821]  He's not going to fire Janet Yellen.
[01:53:34.222 --> 01:53:38.605]  And then on December the 14th, 2016, after President Trump was elected on November the 8th,
[01:53:39.892 --> 01:53:45.579]  This article from Fortune said Janet Yellen and the Fed rise interest rates for the first time in 2016.
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:56.412]  At that time, they said they're going to raise it by a quarter of a percentage point to a half a percent, between a half a percent and three quarters of a percent.
[01:53:57.073 --> 01:53:58.114]  Now they've just done it again.
[01:53:59.122 --> 01:54:03.127]  It is now up to two and a quarter to two and a half percent.
[01:54:03.788 --> 01:54:08.915]  So they've gone from a half a percent to two and a quarter from three quarters of a percent to two and a half percent.
[01:54:09.276 --> 01:54:09.616]  Why?
[01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:10.657]  How did they get there?
[01:54:10.878 --> 01:54:13.822]  They've been raising it a quarter every quarter.
[01:54:13.842 --> 01:54:16.004]  A quarter of a percent every quarter.
[01:54:17.125 --> 01:54:23.611]  Since right after President Trump got elected, I said at the time, I talked about it day after day after day.
[01:54:24.212 --> 01:54:26.834]  When they did it the very first time, I said, we have seen this pattern.
[01:54:26.854 --> 01:54:27.515]  I said, you watch.
[01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:32.079]  They're going to do it a quarter per quarter until they burst the bubble that they created.
[01:54:32.179 --> 01:54:34.041]  It's exactly the same thing that Greenspan did.
[01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:35.002]  And they've been doing that.
[01:54:35.943 --> 01:54:37.084]  As Gateway Pundit pointed out,
[01:54:38.035 --> 01:54:41.578]  The Fed and Jerome Powell have increased annual U.S.
[01:54:41.618 --> 01:54:49.183]  debt by half a trillion dollars just in the interest payments by raising these interest rates from a half a percent to two and a half percent.
[01:54:50.104 --> 01:54:53.106]  It's a hundred times what President Trump wants for the wall.
[01:54:53.827 --> 01:54:56.349]  So they can't find five billion dollars to pay for the wall.
[01:54:57.129 --> 01:55:02.674]  But supposedly, you know, we can have welfare payments that are going to pay for all the immigrants who come in.
[01:55:03.584 --> 01:55:12.510]  And we have interest rates that have been raised, so that's going to be another $500 billion more that we have to pay to service that interest rate.
[01:55:13.451 --> 01:55:18.274]  Is that something that would fall in the category of firing the Fed for cause?
[01:55:20.235 --> 01:55:21.877]  They said after he tanked the U.S.
[01:55:21.917 --> 01:55:26.620]  economy by $4 trillion and wiped out one-sixth of the market, is that something that we could fire him for?
[01:55:28.926 --> 01:55:29.908]  This is what Powell has done.
[01:55:29.948 --> 01:55:31.572]  He had his October the 3rd speech.
[01:55:31.612 --> 01:55:36.241]  He said the economy, he's going to continue to raise interest rates, he said at that point in time.
[01:55:37.243 --> 01:55:37.844]  And then you have
[01:55:38.894 --> 01:55:43.395]  Others say the president cannot do it over disagreement over monetary policy.
[01:55:44.095 --> 01:55:46.296]  What does it mean when you say you're going to fire somebody for cause?
[01:55:46.976 --> 01:55:48.756]  You know, you have two different ways that you work for somebody.
[01:55:48.776 --> 01:55:54.498]  You either have at-will employment contracts, which means that you can leave at will or you can be fired at will.
[01:55:54.538 --> 01:55:57.558]  Nobody has to give the employee or the employer doesn't have to give a reason.
[01:55:58.619 --> 01:56:04.000]  If you are somebody like a CEO, you know, like Les Moonves, you know, you get a contract.
[01:56:05.114 --> 01:56:06.015]  And they can't fire you.
[01:56:06.035 --> 01:56:10.818]  You know, if you're Megyn Kelly or some other big executive, they can't fire you without violating that contract.
[01:56:10.838 --> 01:56:14.700]  So they have to show that you have done something wrong.
[01:56:15.621 --> 01:56:20.004]  So if you have a contract, you're going to be fired either for cause or for misconduct.
[01:56:20.044 --> 01:56:21.065]  And those are two different things.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:27.261]  If we take a look at what this means, termination for cause, according to the U.S.
[01:56:27.401 --> 01:56:33.403]  legal website, it refers to the expiration of a contract when one side fails to act in the terms of the contract.
[01:56:34.163 --> 01:56:38.024]  Termination for cause can result from work not being done or being done incorrectly.
[01:56:38.064 --> 01:56:47.846]  Do you think that wiping out $4 trillion of equity in the stock market, one-sixth of the stock market, do you think that that's doing your work correctly?
[01:56:48.786 --> 01:56:50.767]  Or is that something that President Trump could fire them for?
[01:56:52.208 --> 01:56:54.548]  Does it look like they're incompetent or malicious?
[01:56:54.768 --> 01:56:55.429]  That's the question.
[01:56:55.449 --> 01:56:56.549]  The only question in my mind.
[01:56:57.129 --> 01:57:02.750]  The other thing is serious acts or omissions committed by an employee that adversely affect the company's business in a material respect.
[01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:07.311]  So that would be what you would have in a corporation when you talk about for cause.
[01:57:08.331 --> 01:57:09.551]  That's exactly what they're talking about.
[01:57:09.611 --> 01:57:10.971]  Now, misconduct is something else.
[01:57:11.351 --> 01:57:16.892]  Most of these people who are saying that President Trump can't fire the Fed chair say, no, no, he has to commit a crime or something.
[01:57:16.912 --> 01:57:21.173]  He has to have a Me Too violation or something like that before we get rid of him.
[01:57:22.113 --> 01:57:26.475]  And as long as he doesn't have a casting couch, we're Janet Yellen and we can't get rid of him.
[01:57:26.935 --> 01:57:31.396]  Now typically, in these contracts, they include misconduct.
[01:57:32.097 --> 01:57:39.279]  Things like intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance or violation of a law or violating work and safety or harassing somebody.
[01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:40.299]  They typically include that.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.440]  But it doesn't
[01:57:42.498 --> 01:57:45.419]  Limit itself simply to criminal actions like that.
[01:57:45.439 --> 01:57:47.320]  Alright, that's all the time we've got.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.160]  Thank you for listening.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:48.660]  Stay tuned.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:49.981]  We've got Mike Adams coming up.
[01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:52.021]  And I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas.
[01:57:52.982 --> 01:58:01.565]  Many of you watching or listening have either been completely banned off social media or you have been censored.
[01:58:02.389 --> 01:58:11.356]  And we've seen thousands of prominent voices banned off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Instagram in the last two years.
[01:58:12.256 --> 01:58:20.803]  It all started the day after Hillary Clinton, who outspent Donald Trump 10 to 1 in the 2016 election.
[01:58:22.064 --> 01:58:26.127]  America was supposed to be all sewed up for the culture war.
[01:58:26.906 --> 01:58:31.771]  With the deindustrialization, the demoralization, but it didn't happen the way they'd planned it.
[01:58:32.532 --> 01:58:43.803]  And so now they've announced Michael Savage, 20-something years on air, number one in his slot nationwide, is having his show canceled and replaced with Ben Shapiro, who's never even had a talk show on the radio.
[01:58:45.645 --> 01:58:47.788]  Now we see they're trying to take Tucker Carlson off the air.
[01:58:48.666 --> 01:58:52.493]  Now we see Gavin McGinnis, number one on CRTV, taken down.
[01:58:53.234 --> 01:58:59.786]  Whoever's number one on their platform is taken down, because that's who the globalists fear is
