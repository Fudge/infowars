[00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:09.827]  Two of our reporters are on the ground and are walking in to the controlled borders zone.
[00:00:09.847 --> 00:00:12.149]  It's about a 20 minute walk.
[00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:24.242]  They've gotten out of their vehicles and they're traveling down the beach towards where the illegal alien UN-funded horde is beginning to mass in the last 24 hours and have been scaling the fence, throwing rocks at people.
[00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.506]  We're going to have them joining us in about an hour live.
[00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:34.751]  They're also going to be posting exclusive reports to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.937]  So look for that live feed coming up probably in the second hour today.
[00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:47.984]  I don't even at this point know what to say because we know there is a wall
[00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:50.374]  I don't
[00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.474]  Hours before, with the controlled corporate press, he would go to.
[00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:22.236]  He arrested and prosecuted and persecuted whistleblowers, members of the press, the likes of which we've never seen in our history.
[00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:26.257]  There's video of him saying, this is my house, get out of here.
[00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:30.119]  And having somebody that doesn't shut up like Acosta thrown out, which was cheered.
[00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:40.402]  But then a federal judge, recently appointed by Trump, said Acosta was abused and his rights were trampled.
[00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.922]  To be thrown out, and that's another hoax.
[00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:50.484]  Acosta's hard pass, which means he can wander basically anywhere he wants, was taken.
[00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:53.605]  He still has his soft pass to go to the press conferences.
[00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:57.466]  But guess who the mainstream media lobbied a year and a half ago to have their soft pass taken?
[00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:59.287]  Infowars.com.
[00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:05.849]  Thousands of articles, national scandal, with a controlled corporate press weighing in saying Alex Jones is fake.
[00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:16.081]  And Dr. Jerome Corsi needs to be thrown out and the White House buckled and said, okay, they don't get to come to the press conference.
[00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.283]  And now the very same groups all get all upset.
[00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:26.265]  The federal judge sees that in the controlled corporate media and says, let me virtue signal.
[00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:32.468]  You see, anyone that sides with America and with common sense is under attack.
[00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:33.709]  And so these cowards,
[00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:35.514]  We're good to go.
[00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:56.879]  Same thing with the appointment of Whitaker as the acting attorney general.
[00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.223]  He has 210 days for them to start hearings for his official approval.
[00:03:01.283 --> 00:03:03.865]  He's acting AG, has all the powers of the AG.
[00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.627]  The media says that's not true, it's a hoax.
[00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.810]  So it's the same scenario over and over again.
[00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.314]  Republican judges, Democrat judges, ruling against Trump until he gets to the Supreme Court.
[00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:19.985]  And then it's so obvious how fraudulent it is, the Supreme Court has to overrule over and over again.
[00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.926]  The lower courts, there's never any coverage of that.
[00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:22.987]  Let me explain something.
[00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:28.691]  There's something called separation of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:37.257]  And the President, one infinity percent, has control over who comes in the White House and who doesn't.
[00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.559]  The President doesn't have to have a press conference.
[00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.261]  The President could shut down the press office in there.
[00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:45.870]  There wasn't one until about 80 years ago.
[00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.091]  The President can do whatever he wants, but he is always letting the press in.
[00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:59.857]  He kicked Acosta out because Acosta was grabbing the woman, but the media all lined up as liars, as truth assassins, and they said he didn't touch her.
[00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:02.418]  Even though you all saw him do it.
[00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.840]  So, this is the next level.
[00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.042]  This is the next level.
[00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:10.762]  It's not about Acosta and this petty issue.
[00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:11.643]  It's that
[00:04:14.122 --> 00:04:16.384]  Most people are scared that Trump appoints.
[00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:22.229]  And they'll side against him every time they'll side against America because they're cowards and they're scum.
[00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.532]  And they got into the system so that they can be part of the system.
[00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:30.356]  Trump is an outsider coming in trying to desperately wrest control from these special interests.
[00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:31.297]  They're fighting.
[00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:34.079]  They're fighting to maintain control, bloodsuckers.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.441]  We'll be back.
[00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:35.941]  Stay with us.
[00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:36.902]  Special guest straight ahead.
[00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:50.420]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.261]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:56.146]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:07.463]  It is Friday the 16th day of November 2018.
[00:06:08.123 --> 00:06:16.046]  I am your host Alex Jones and we're gonna plunge directly into the insane news.
[00:06:17.806 --> 00:06:19.847]  Let me just read the headlines.
[00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:22.968]  Winter storm Avery causes chaotic
[00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:31.107]  Commutes strand students at school overnight kills nine on slick roads.
[00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:39.214]  A lot of top meteorologists and astrophysicists say that we're looking for a new ice age to begin, at least a mini ice age.
[00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:50.824]  Meanwhile, Celine Dion is now launching a new clothing line where she literally invades a school nursery and turns all the children genderless.
[00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:55.106]  The assault, the rape of the genders accelerates.
[00:06:55.907 --> 00:07:03.670]  Furious Tories rebel and attack their puppet globalist Prime Minister for betraying Britain on a vote of no confidence.
[00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.970]  She can be removed from office today.
[00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:20.316]  The new so-called Brexit deal, three years after the UK voted to pull out of the New World Order and the EU, actually gives the EU total control over the UK and makes them a complete vassal.
[00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:26.686]  So you talk about a really, really slick stab in the back, that's it.
[00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:29.767]  We have Paul Watson joining us to break that down as well.
[00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:35.989]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, migrants, that's illegal aliens, funded by the U.N.
[00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.449]  and U.S.
[00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.089]  taxpayers.
[00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.710]  Migrants are scaling U.S.-Mexico fence.
[00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.890]  Will they be arrested?
[00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.351]  San Diego Tribune.
[00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.932]  Dozens from caravan line up at border seeking asylum.
[00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:58.240]  More caravan migrants arrive in Tijuana, braced for long stay, as more than 50,000 from three different caravans make their way.
[00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:04.923]  Meanwhile, Springdale man arrested after shooting at multiple officers during pursuit.
[00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:06.443]  That's KFSM.
[00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:11.225]  Well, you'd have to read in USA Today and everywhere else to find out who this Springdale man was.
[00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:15.687]  An illegal alien trying to kill a bunch of cops.
[00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:21.073]  But, again, you'll never hear that, though it's in the arrest information.
[00:08:21.373 --> 00:08:27.756]  Meanwhile, Camilla Harris of California draws parallel between ICE and the KKK.
[00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:29.897]  Having a border is the KKK.
[00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:34.319]  Arresting someone shooting and trying to kill cops is KKK.
[00:08:36.107 --> 00:08:41.010]  Meanwhile, Vice President Pence says empire and aggression have no place in Indo-Pacific.
[00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:44.193]  Reuters, a shot across the bow at the Communist Chinese.
[00:08:44.913 --> 00:09:04.967]  Speaking of Communist Chinese, I've told you they're exporting their Mark of the Beast global social score and working with Google and now secretly Facebook, Twitter and of course Apple is chaperoning the whole merger to export global social score with face scanning cameras up to a half a mile away
[00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:08.237]  To ticket you and control your life.
[00:09:08.317 --> 00:09:18.422]  And they just announced in the U.S., Chinese-developed face scanning is going to be deployed, where if they see you on your phone from a half mile away, you'll be given a ticket or it'll be added to your social score.
[00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:20.823]  Meanwhile, Venezuela thinks it's great as well.
[00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:24.444]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens.
[00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:28.486]  A global social score system, Reuters reports, now coming to Venezuela.
[00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.267]  And who designed it?
[00:09:29.687 --> 00:09:33.689]  Chinese telecom giant, building Venezuela's social credit system.
[00:09:34.787 --> 00:09:38.050]  Told you this five years ago, six years ago, now it's in Reuters.
[00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:42.795]  Meanwhile, Professor Warren's Amazon Echo is always recording her conversations.
[00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:45.278]  Judge gives authorities access to Alexa's recordings.
[00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:53.447]  In double murder case, turns out everything 24-7 for over a year, from the time they plugged it in, was recorded at the Amazon databanks.
[00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:56.270]  Co-housed with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:00.785]  That's just some of what we'll be covering there.
[00:10:00.825 --> 00:10:08.588]  Meanwhile, more and more judges are ruling in the UK, Canada, and the United States that atheists have a right to be your preachers!
[00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:11.749]  You heard me right.
[00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:13.149]  They must invade everything.
[00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.851]  The trans movement has a right to tell your five-year-old boy they're really a girl?
[00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:19.313]  And your five-year-old girl, they're really a boy?
[00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:22.976]  They have a right to have men compete in sports and take over women's sports?
[00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:26.940]  And now Christian Church backs atheist pastor amid uproar.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.184]  That's an InfoWars.com article, Kit Daniels.
[00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:33.407]  Yes, we're going to teach you there is no God.
[00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:38.332]  That's the new official religion invading the churches through the ecumenical movement.
[00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:42.776]  Because if you don't teach that, your 501c3 is taken.
[00:10:42.996 --> 00:10:43.656]  It's here.
[00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:47.898]  Meanwhile, Rand Paul warns of censorship of conservatives by big tech.
[00:10:48.338 --> 00:10:49.819]  Of all places, he went to CNN to do it.
[00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:59.043]  Meanwhile, a real journalist releasing real information that exposed criminal activity is now, we've learned, been secretly indicted, as we first reported a year ago.
[00:10:59.103 --> 00:11:02.885]  Now it's confirmed they accidentally released it in a data dump.
[00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:03.846]  The federal judge did.
[00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:10.647]  Assange prosecutor accidentally reveals he has been secretly indicted.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:11.468]  Meanwhile...
[00:11:12.998 --> 00:11:24.682]  The unelected dictator of the European Union, Juncker, has been seen totally drunk, unable to talk again, at the podium wearing a brown shoe and a black shoe, until his aides come over and tell him.
[00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:28.323]  He's also been videotaped again groping women in public.
[00:11:28.883 --> 00:11:31.944]  So all of that is coming up as well.
[00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:34.805]  But now, for this segment and the next,
[00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:49.292]  I'm going to be speaking with David Knight, of the David Knight Show, that kicks off every weekday morning, 8am to 11am, preceding this transmission, the Alex Jones Show, about a story within a story within a story.
[00:11:50.153 --> 00:12:02.681]  Jim Acosta gets up, as you all know, a week and a half ago, and says, less than a week and a half ago, a little over a week and a half ago, I guess about nine days ago, technically, Jim Acosta gets up,
[00:12:03.692 --> 00:12:05.653]  And he says, there is no caravan.
[00:12:05.673 --> 00:12:06.733]  And Trump goes, no, it's real.
[00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:08.634]  And so Acosta says, no, it's not.
[00:12:08.674 --> 00:12:09.615]  It's hundreds of miles away.
[00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:12.036]  So just everything coming out of Acosta's mouth is a lie.
[00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.397]  So after three questions, Trump says, that's enough.
[00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:20.400]  Acosta grabs the mic back from the intern, pushes her arm down, and the whole corporate media says it's not true.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.080]  He didn't touch her.
[00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:23.921]  This is incredible.
[00:12:23.961 --> 00:12:24.942]  Fox News weighs in.
[00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:29.904]  A suit is filed in federal court in a recently appointed judge that Trump nominated.
[00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:36.498]  And the judge, Virtue Signaling, says that Acosta's rights were violated.
[00:12:36.518 --> 00:12:37.318]  We're going to read this.
[00:12:37.638 --> 00:12:38.759]  And the First Amendment was.
[00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:41.321]  So, A, that's a hoax, not a hoax.
[00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:42.541]  He had his hard pass taken.
[00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:45.463]  We can just walk around anywhere he wants, anytime at the White House.
[00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:46.744]  He can get his soft pass.
[00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:53.088]  Plus, mainstream media, including CNN, lobbied to have our soft pass taken a year and a half ago from Jerome Gorsy, which was taken.
[00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:55.670]  So you just heap the hypocrisy on the hypocrisy.
[00:12:57.446 --> 00:12:59.347]  Then, it gets worse.
[00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:09.010]  We go back and see Obama criticizing Trump, saying he's in a war on the press, when Obama used to shut down questioners and say, you're in my house.
[00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.931]  We'll play that in a moment.
[00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:21.635]  And would arrest hundreds of whistleblowers and members of the press, and blocked hundreds of conservative publications from the White House court completely, saying he believed they weren't reporting accurately.
[00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:25.817]  So he says specifically you're banned, because I don't like how you report.
[00:13:26.735 --> 00:13:27.135]  Remember that?
[00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:30.717]  Obama boots reporters from conservative papers.
[00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:35.299]  Obama, who wants surveilled reporters, criticizes Trump over press freedom.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.880]  Flashback.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.602]  Here are all the times Obama kicked reporters out of press events.
[00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:41.422]  This is incredible.
[00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:44.223]  And here he is saying, this is my house, which is true.
[00:13:44.303 --> 00:13:47.305]  He is the executive over the executive branch when he was president.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.282]  And 100% has control over who can come in and out of the White House.
[00:13:52.703 --> 00:14:13.077]  But now, just two years and change later, the entire corporate press, including Fox News and federal judges, come in and say, you can't do that, you abused poor little Jim Acosta, who didn't touch that woman, even though you all saw him do it, and didn't jerk the microphone away, and who never heckles, and he's a perfect little angel, the judge said.
[00:14:13.097 --> 00:14:14.438]  I'm gonna read the ruling to you.
[00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:17.140]  Acosta has been abused!
[00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.391]  This is incredible, because CNN is globalist-run media.
[00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:22.772]  It's force-fed.
[00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:29.094]  We're gonna go to break in a moment, come back with David Knight to get his breakdown of this, but here is Obama saying, this is my house.
[00:14:30.114 --> 00:14:38.277]  The civil rights of LGBT Americans is... Yeah, hold on a second, I... Okay, you know what?
[00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:44.019]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.160]  Hey!
[00:14:47.355 --> 00:15:02.733]  Listen, you're in my house.
[00:15:03.093 --> 00:15:06.037]  It's not respectful when you get invited to somebody.
[00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:17.430]  You're not gonna get a good response from me by interrupting me like this.
[00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.130]  No.
[00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.510]  Shame on you.
[00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.011]  You shouldn't be doing this.
[00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:26.632]  Obama!
[00:15:26.652 --> 00:15:28.553]  Obama!
[00:15:28.573 --> 00:15:31.914]  Obama!
[00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:32.654]  Obama!
[00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:34.254]  Obama!
[00:15:34.274 --> 00:15:34.594]  Obama!
[00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:35.154]  Shame on you.
[00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:36.135]  Same thing Trump said.
[00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:40.556]  Alright, you rolling?
[00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:43.807]  What am I going to say?
[00:15:46.469 --> 00:16:00.741]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:03.383]  That it was basic American free market liberty
[00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:06.953]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[00:16:07.453 --> 00:16:17.382]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of...
[00:16:20.248 --> 00:16:20.868]  Evil regime.
[00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:22.309]  Radical Islam.
[00:16:22.329 --> 00:16:23.730]  The Communist Chinese.
[00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.212]  The evil Junker of the EU.
[00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:28.533]  It's just crazy.
[00:16:29.093 --> 00:16:30.474]  Of course we can beat these people.
[00:16:30.995 --> 00:16:32.576]  Of course they can be stopped.
[00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:36.078]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:39.420]  I always wondered 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.842]  Then about 25 years ago I got politically involved.
[00:16:43.062 --> 00:16:44.043]  23 years ago I got on air.
[00:16:44.123 --> 00:16:44.804]  Then I learned why.
[00:16:44.824 --> 00:16:46.445]  Because you get fired.
[00:16:46.966 --> 00:16:48.247]  Because you get demonized.
[00:16:48.267 --> 00:16:49.307]  Because you get sued.
[00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:50.969]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.311]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[00:16:54.892 --> 00:16:57.194]  And so you'll never stick your head up because you don't want that to happen.
[00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:03.747]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:07.089]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.392]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:13.074]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:18.417]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[00:17:19.218 --> 00:17:20.259]  And that's why.
[00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:26.362]  I know we're going to win because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty.
[00:17:27.022 --> 00:17:29.164]  I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[00:17:29.824 --> 00:17:31.325]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:36.428]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[00:17:36.948 --> 00:17:41.270]  We're going to send a million letters at WriteTrump.com.
[00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.811]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:45.012]  That way, two letters go per person.
[00:17:45.052 --> 00:17:48.774]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[00:17:48.854 --> 00:17:49.355]  I want to send
[00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:56.020]  About 80% of whatever we get in, I hope it'll be a million, that's up to you, to the White House.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.042]  Another 100,000 to Mar-a-Lago, another 100,000 to Trump Tower.
[00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:09.009]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these, and he pays attention to a letter, he sees that as like 10,000 emails, that you took action, that you got involved.
[00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:15.674]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[00:18:17.398 --> 00:18:18.420]  RightTrump.com.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.024]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the President.
[00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:23.148]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[00:18:23.648 --> 00:18:25.171]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.473]  We're going to send it regardless.
[00:18:26.834 --> 00:18:27.415]  It's so easy.
[00:18:27.455 --> 00:18:28.456]  Go spend two minutes.
[00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:29.678]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:32.014]  Sign up, send a letter.
[00:18:32.254 --> 00:18:33.575]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:39.460]  Hopefully you add something to it so that it'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.862]  And regardless, it gets the globalist's attention.
[00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:43.003]  So we're not laying down.
[00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:46.165]  We're not just curling up in a ball in the fetal position and taking all this crap.
[00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:49.168]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against big tech.
[00:18:49.508 --> 00:18:53.071]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:59.076]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[00:18:59.796 --> 00:19:02.360]  I'm going to found an organization very soon as well.
[00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.485]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[00:19:05.505 --> 00:19:10.413]  But this is phase one to show the president we're sending him a million real letters.
[00:19:11.621 --> 00:19:13.041]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:18.163]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at WriteTrump.com.
[00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:22.064]  So go there yourself, text message, email your friends, neighbors, family, and tell them.
[00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:24.405]  Get involved and stand up to Apple.
[00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:25.285]  Stand up to Google.
[00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:26.086]  Stand up to Facebook.
[00:19:26.306 --> 00:19:32.508]  Stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying, America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:33.728]  God bless you all.
[00:19:41.185 --> 00:19:55.508]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:59.169 --> 00:20:04.430]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:20.806]  It was Tucker Carlson a few nights ago that dedicated two segments to the unprecedented attack on the First Amendment on the press by Obama, by the Democrats, and currently Big Tech working with the Democrats.
[00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:24.969]  Congressional hearings saying silence all conservatives off the internet.
[00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:34.935]  And that's how they were able to basically steal the 2018 election, a combination of censorship and fraud.
[00:20:34.995 --> 00:20:36.256]  Meanwhile, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:37.737]  Acosta gets a pass.
[00:20:39.426 --> 00:20:43.850]  Trump judge sides with CNN White House media mess.
[00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:53.379]  Well the mess is that these lower courts always go against Trump and then the higher courts always go with him because Trump's in the right.
[00:20:53.639 --> 00:20:54.900]  He can kick anybody out he wants.
[00:20:55.181 --> 00:21:00.886]  Obama kicked hundreds of different conservative outlets out over the years saying I don't think you're accurate reporting.
[00:21:01.807 --> 00:21:05.070]  He was specifically saying I don't like what you said so you're out.
[00:21:06.283 --> 00:21:10.008]  It's very draconian, it's very authoritarian, but it's the executive branch.
[00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:11.611]  You don't have a right to be in there.
[00:21:13.593 --> 00:21:14.354]  Inside the White House.
[00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:18.740]  You can go around to events, you can ask questions, try to cover things, but you can't be inside the White House.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.383]  Like Obama said, you're in my house.
[00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:21.805]  We played that clip earlier.
[00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:42.877]  But the fact that the media ignores the arrest of hundreds of reporters, the prosecution, the persecution, using the Trading with the Enemy Act, the Sedition Acts, all of the stuff that nobody's ever done except Lincoln in the middle of a huge war, to the press, and the corporate media praised this when their own reporters were being indicted and arrested.
[00:21:44.078 --> 00:21:46.300]  And now Julian Assange, we learn, has a secret indictment.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.322]  We reported on it over a year ago, but next year's news today.
[00:21:51.223 --> 00:21:59.989]  So I don't even know how to describe how insane this is, and we're right in the middle of the story, because Paul Watson blew up the video when they were saying Acosta hadn't touched her.
[00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:08.895]  He zoomed in about double, did nothing else to it, uploaded it to Twitter, and they go, it's a different video format than the original.
[00:22:08.935 --> 00:22:11.897]  That's what happens when you compress it, download it, and re-upload it.
[00:22:13.238 --> 00:22:15.620]  Hundreds of different angles of the same thing!
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.542]  And the White House spokesperson said, look,
[00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:20.838]  Their video's real, it zoomed in.
[00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.140]  The President said that too.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.861]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:22:23.961 --> 00:22:24.862]  Everybody saw it.
[00:22:25.123 --> 00:22:25.943]  Everybody saw it.
[00:22:27.605 --> 00:22:31.749]  So this is next level, where CNN and the rest of the corporate press claims they're free speech.
[00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:41.839]  Claims that they stand with the First Amendment for themselves, but then are advocates for getting rid of it for everybody else.
[00:22:43.035 --> 00:22:53.999]  It's quite a sickening position and it needs to be called out when they have hearings in January where the Democrats are going to witch hunt Trump now as the enemy of the press when he's been the opposite.
[00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:57.080]  He actually goes towards the press.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.500]  He talks.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.480]  He has more press conferences than anybody I've ever seen.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.401]  He's more open and transparent than anybody.
[00:23:02.312 --> 00:23:07.496]  And they turn that around, so when the Republicans have these hearings, when the Democrats have them, the Republicans have got to say, are you kidding?
[00:23:07.897 --> 00:23:12.801]  You're the ones in these very committees that said silence Infowars, and Drudge Report, and Talk Radio.
[00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:14.122]  You people are monsters!
[00:23:14.563 --> 00:23:17.025]  And you think we're so dumb that you're now doing this?
[00:23:17.065 --> 00:23:19.467]  David Knight, this is just so insane.
[00:23:20.663 --> 00:23:30.997]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I think it needs to be said that there's a big difference between taking actions against a specific reporter and taking actions against an entire news organization.
[00:23:31.037 --> 00:23:36.324]  Now that latter is what Barack Obama has done as well, but it's also a difference between speech and conduct.
[00:23:36.664 --> 00:23:39.726]  You know, we should always say, I don't like your speech or whatever.
[00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.106]  You say, I can do anything I want.
[00:23:41.126 --> 00:23:42.307]  I can scream and shout.
[00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:43.708]  I can wave my arms around.
[00:23:43.728 --> 00:23:44.488]  But you hit me.
[00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:45.749]  That's a different thing, right?
[00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:48.931]  And that's really what's going on here in the White House.
[00:23:49.331 --> 00:23:59.517]  It's not just the fact that you've got Jim Acosta constantly trying to seize the stage and grandstand and, you know, draw attention to himself by debating the president.
[00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:02.018]  But it's that when they told him, OK, that's enough.
[00:24:02.238 --> 00:24:03.539]  I've answered two of your questions.
[00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.259]  He starts with a third one.
[00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:04.680]  That's enough.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.961]  The intern tries to take it away and he gets physical with her.
[00:24:08.422 --> 00:24:09.682]  And for that reason, he can be thrown out.
[00:24:09.702 --> 00:24:13.264]  But if we go back to what Obama did, Alex, as you were talking about, going back to 2009,
[00:24:14.904 --> 00:24:21.609]  Obama banned Fox News from a lot of very important interviews and Josh Earnest was up front about it.
[00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:22.489]  He bragged about that.
[00:24:22.509 --> 00:24:24.631]  But of course now Fox News is under different management.
[00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:27.473]  And now they're standing proudly with CNN.
[00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:28.433]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:24:28.473 --> 00:24:31.976]  We had Barack Obama before he became president, about a week before the election.
[00:24:32.556 --> 00:24:36.559]  There were some newspapers that had endorsed his opponent at the time, McCain.
[00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:40.341]  And he threw those reporters off the plane right after he got elected.
[00:24:40.381 --> 00:24:43.283]  He threw a black female reporter out of the White House.
[00:24:43.303 --> 00:24:45.245]  Can you imagine if Trump did something like that?
[00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:50.368]  Well, they actually, she showed up and didn't know at the tarmac and they physically grabbed her and drug her off.
[00:24:50.528 --> 00:24:51.609]  I'll find the photo of that.
[00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:52.930]  It's incredible.
[00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:59.234]  Yeah, and then the clip that you were playing there, played earlier this morning about the, you know, this is my house.
[00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:01.356]  That was a transgender individual.
[00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:02.817]  That was an LGBT event.
[00:25:03.527 --> 00:25:07.651]  And that was a transgender guy that was upset about something that Obama was not doing.
[00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:11.414]  He goes, hey, you know, that's very rude, I'm not going to let you, this is my house, you get out.
[00:25:11.714 --> 00:25:17.259]  So here's the deal, Alex, you know we've got a difference between conduct and speech that they want to ignore.
[00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:23.585]  There's a difference between one reporter and an entire news organization that they want to ignore.
[00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:30.350]  And then there's the difference that the White House is not the public square, and they want to ignore that, because they have a double standard.
[00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:44.400]  Whenever you do anything to these protected mainstream media organizations, then they scream bloody murder that you're attacking their free speech, but then they allow InfoWars to be completely deprogrammed off of Twitter and other places.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.121]  You know, when we talk about the public square, right?
[00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:48.783]  The public square is not the White House.
[00:25:49.123 --> 00:25:51.545]  The public square is not Tucker Carlson's house.
[00:25:52.586 --> 00:25:54.207]  The public square is Twitter.
[00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:56.108]  Jack Dorsey has said that eight times.
[00:25:56.248 --> 00:25:57.589]  Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:25:57.809 --> 00:26:02.892]  A federal judge earlier this year ruled that people attacking Trump, he can't block them on his Twitter.
[00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:12.497]  It's a public square, but the very same type of judiciary then says they can ban any nationalist conservatives they want off of everything.
[00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:14.518]  So this is a huge double standard.
[00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:20.762]  It is cartels of corporations and government working in unison to silence pro-America
[00:26:21.542 --> 00:26:26.383]  Pro-Trump, pro-restoration of the republic media, and that's what makes it an organized crime.
[00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:29.264]  It is a concerted effort to silence us.
[00:26:29.544 --> 00:26:34.306]  Here is Senator Rand Paul speaking about this, of all places, CNN.
[00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:39.527]  There he is in the lion's den of the anti-free speech movement, talking about it.
[00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:43.563]  You know, I think the whole Facebook thing presents a conundrum to us.
[00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:44.944]  It's a privately owned company.
[00:26:45.024 --> 00:26:48.485]  Most time, conservatives, we don't want to over-regulate private businesses.
[00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:53.307]  But they do have sort of a monopoly on this sort of social exchange speech.
[00:26:53.747 --> 00:27:01.270]  So what I've been saying for a while is we need to look at the barriers to entry the government might be creating and see if we can allow them to other companies to bring up.
[00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:06.171]  Not the government starting other companies, but the government getting out of the way to allow competition with Facebook.
[00:27:06.632 --> 00:27:09.993]  I think if it gets so bad that they don't allow conservative viewpoints on Facebook,
[00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:40.113]  I think you will get to a point where people will leave in droves and go to other and I think people already are so if Facebook wants to continue to make money and they make lots of it I would suggest to them that they really really advocate to let conservative opinions and not to somehow censor conservative opinions and you know if they become so politically correct that that any kind of conservative opinion is unacceptable if you are opposed to open borders or something that somehow hate speech or something we're gonna live in a world where people are eventually gonna have to go somewhere else to
[00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:44.975]  Now, there's Rand Paul being very, very nice, showing he really knows what's happening.
[00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:48.336]  I'm going to come back with David and talk about it, but it came out today.
[00:27:49.917 --> 00:27:51.058]  In fact, I didn't see it in my stack.
[00:27:51.078 --> 00:27:51.898]  It's funny I can print that.
[00:27:53.038 --> 00:28:04.583]  Mark Zuckerberg approached the board of Facebook and wanted to remove President Trump in 2017 from Facebook for not wanting to have open borders.
[00:28:04.643 --> 00:28:08.285]  That's the big globalist crime, saying you have a country.
[00:28:09.245 --> 00:28:15.991]  Saying that, yes, Trump's right to ban people from six nations that don't have real passports, that are terror exporters, from the country.
[00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:18.252]  That's one reason they said I was banned, was the Islamophobia.
[00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:29.241]  Yes, I'm afraid of Somalia and Sudan, where they don't even have, you know, electricity or running water, and kill, you know, women, children, have sex slavery, being able to openly just fly here unvetted.
[00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:31.103]  Yes, I think, I think that's the right thing to do.
[00:28:31.343 --> 00:28:32.544]  So they want to ban everybody.
[00:28:32.784 --> 00:28:33.544]  Let's get this straight.
[00:28:33.564 --> 00:28:35.226]  They want to abuse their power, and they are.
[00:28:37.629 --> 00:28:41.293]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:28:41.593 --> 00:28:45.017]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:28:45.378 --> 00:28:54.928]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:28:55.408 --> 00:28:58.833]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[00:28:59.194 --> 00:29:04.161]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:06.584]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:29:06.844 --> 00:29:11.531]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:12.112]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:29:12.512 --> 00:29:16.314]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:29:16.535 --> 00:29:19.196]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:22.778]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:29:23.139 --> 00:29:28.442]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:29:28.522 --> 00:29:32.665]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:29:33.525 --> 00:29:36.307]  Super Silver Wound Gel.

[00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:31.367]  Yep!
[00:30:43.855 --> 00:30:49.097]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[00:30:50.138 --> 00:30:57.020]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:59.722]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:31:00.362 --> 00:31:01.242]  I want to keep going.
[00:31:01.262 --> 00:31:05.584]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:31:05.644 --> 00:31:07.625]  I want to push all the way.
[00:31:08.585 --> 00:31:09.525]  I've committed to do that.
[00:31:09.665 --> 00:31:10.465]  I've prayed for that.
[00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:12.646]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:31:12.686 --> 00:31:15.667]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:18.987]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:20.708]  I will never falter.
[00:31:21.268 --> 00:31:23.308]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:24.308]  I physically will.
[00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:31.490]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.

[00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:27.539]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.

[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.242]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:43.806]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:59.754 --> 00:33:00.395]  Big Brother.
[00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:02.115]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:02.675 --> 00:33:03.816]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:06.036]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:07.397]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:07.937 --> 00:33:12.638]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.222 --> 00:33:16.343]  Take CNN, for example.
[00:33:17.064 --> 00:33:26.051]  It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the Internet, on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say.
[00:33:26.711 --> 00:33:28.893]  Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.
[00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:33.737]  The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet, InfoWars.
[00:33:34.317 --> 00:33:40.602]  You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech, because it was exactly that.
[00:33:41.423 --> 00:33:43.924]  But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.
[00:33:44.004 --> 00:33:49.227]  Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme.
[00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:55.190]  CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him again.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.232]  Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech.
[00:33:58.992 --> 00:34:00.313]  Only when it's their speech.
[00:34:00.733 --> 00:34:08.499]  You'll notice, by the way, that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT if they didn't register as foreign agents.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.341]  Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government.
[00:34:11.762 --> 00:34:12.682]  So is the BBC.
[00:34:13.363 --> 00:34:16.325]  Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national.
[00:34:16.445 --> 00:34:21.087]  This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign agent.
[00:34:21.647 --> 00:34:29.429]  But because RT is owned by Russia, which the left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.
[00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.431]  So call CNN what you will, but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment.
[00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:35.111]  They are not.
[00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:42.874]  Now I want to get David Knight's take on this, but understand folks, it's not about Acosta or this particular story.
[00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:46.160]  It's about the whole thing is a lie.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.362]  And they're practicing lying now at a level 5, 10 times worse than before?
[00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:54.683]  20 times?
[00:34:54.703 --> 00:34:56.083]  I don't know how to quantify.
[00:34:56.103 --> 00:34:58.544]  And they're doing it on every channel now.
[00:34:59.385 --> 00:35:02.466]  Where they'll go on every channel and say Donald Trump hates all Mexicans.
[00:35:03.386 --> 00:35:05.187]  Or Alex Jones is a Nazi.
[00:35:06.407 --> 00:35:10.709]  Or Alex Jones just said kill the press with battle rifles and then not show a clip.
[00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:22.819]  You understand, that level of propaganda is super dangerous, and it shows they've converted the entire corporate press to levels of lying that are just staggering.
[00:35:22.879 --> 00:35:24.661]  They will do anything.
[00:35:25.702 --> 00:35:26.802]  There is no caravan.
[00:35:27.243 --> 00:35:28.424]  I did not touch the woman.
[00:35:30.105 --> 00:35:31.346]  I did not know who she was.
[00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:33.288]  I only asked one question.
[00:35:33.508 --> 00:35:35.349]  Acosta has said all of this.
[00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.072]  And the press, the so-called press, went, yes.
[00:35:38.912 --> 00:35:39.153]  Yes.
[00:35:40.714 --> 00:35:42.035]  He did not touch the woman.
[00:35:42.296 --> 00:35:43.697]  He only asked one question.
[00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.699]  Jim Acosta is very polite.
[00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:51.845]  And then the federal judge said, I've got the ruling right here, Acosta has had his rights grossly violated.
[00:35:52.326 --> 00:35:55.349]  What Trump did is terrible to this man and this institution.
[00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:57.871]  Jim Acosta can act however he wants.
[00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:59.132]  It actually says all this.
[00:36:00.854 --> 00:36:02.276]  So you've got the political class
[00:36:03.638 --> 00:36:04.618]  Lined up against Trump.
[00:36:04.658 --> 00:36:05.799]  And I've got the articles right here.
[00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:13.801]  Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook execs reportedly investigated if they could ban Trump after Zuck was appalled by his call for the Muslim ban.
[00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:15.382]  It wasn't a Muslim ban.
[00:36:15.422 --> 00:36:25.905]  It was six countries that don't even have working airports where Imams give out a piece of paper saying who they are and then they use it to bring terrorists in and smugglers.
[00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:28.966]  Unbelievable!
[00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:31.579]  Insane!
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.961]  Oh, look, could Twitter ban Trump for violating its terms of service?
[00:36:35.021 --> 00:36:36.923]  Company forced to explain why it hasn't.
[00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:39.804]  Twitter explains why it hasn't banned Trump.
[00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:40.445]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:40.465 --> 00:36:41.625]  Why haven't they banned Alex Jones?
[00:36:41.926 --> 00:36:42.746]  Oh, I guess they did!
[00:36:44.267 --> 00:36:49.010]  The point is, they're foaming at the mouth to get everybody's free speech, including the president.
[00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:55.474]  Under Obama, they're arresting reporters en masse and kicking out anybody that, you know, didn't endorse Obama.
[00:36:57.025 --> 00:36:57.645]  And they lie.
[00:36:57.805 --> 00:36:58.505]  It's more lies.
[00:36:58.785 --> 00:37:00.606]  They said he was kicked out of the press corps.
[00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:01.106]  No!
[00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:11.608]  They only took his hard pass, where that disruptor could walk around like Frankenstein in the middle of the German forest, harassing people at the White House 24-7.
[00:37:12.888 --> 00:37:14.329]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:24.191]  So, there's a lot of news, but we're covering this because a federal judge and a whole bunch of other federal judges said Trump can't control the borders.
[00:37:25.674 --> 00:37:28.816]  Now you've got a Democrat Congresswoman like Kamala Harris of California.
[00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:30.337]  She ought to worry about it being on fire.
[00:37:31.618 --> 00:37:33.579]  Or the human feces everywhere, or the bankruptcy.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.041]  She says ICE is the KKK!
[00:37:36.261 --> 00:37:37.262]  That clip's coming up!
[00:37:38.407 --> 00:37:39.928]  This woman has guards at her house.
[00:37:39.988 --> 00:37:41.629]  This woman has guards at the Capitol.
[00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.572]  This woman, though, says our country itself can't have any border.
[00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:47.214]  That means you can't have a country.
[00:37:47.234 --> 00:37:48.855]  Remember, nationalism's dirty.
[00:37:49.375 --> 00:37:50.356]  Nationalism's bad.
[00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:52.418]  Nationalism's something that's evil.
[00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:53.358]  You can't have it.
[00:37:54.019 --> 00:37:55.220]  Of course, they're not getting rid of the nation.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.681]  They're just conquering it.
[00:37:58.302 --> 00:38:05.748]  I'm going to give a nice take on this at the end of this segment and next segment, and then we'll look ahead on who else is joining us today and all the other incredible news that's coming up.
[00:38:06.188 --> 00:38:07.149]  But before I go any further,
[00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:10.678]  We're going to win this fight.
[00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:18.383]  And because the globalists have been caught lying, what they've decided to do is just muddy the waters with so much lying, you get conditioned to just accept it.
[00:38:19.624 --> 00:38:22.106]  That's all they're doing right now, is cult programming.
[00:38:23.687 --> 00:38:25.468]  And it's working on some people, it's not working on others.
[00:38:25.488 --> 00:38:30.752]  They're trying to murder logic, and they're trying to destroy any institution that will stand up and point out they're lying.
[00:38:31.372 --> 00:38:32.233]  You know why they hate them for?
[00:38:32.253 --> 00:38:35.075]  Because we'll show you a stack of history of how Obama was
[00:38:37.068 --> 00:38:38.992]  Hundreds of times meaner to the press than Trump?
[00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:40.334]  Trump fights back!
[00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:42.237]  He lets the press run wild!
[00:38:42.678 --> 00:38:43.920]  Obama had him by the neck!
[00:38:44.942 --> 00:38:46.805]  Absolutely dominating and controlling him!
[00:38:47.026 --> 00:38:47.547]  Like a pimp!
[00:38:50.031 --> 00:38:56.633]  It's just insane how they get ratings and money off Trump, and they get stardom off Trump, and people tune back in because of Trump.
[00:38:56.793 --> 00:39:01.435]  They exist because of Trump, and then they hate the very... It's like the New York Times hating Drudge Report.
[00:39:01.615 --> 00:39:03.655]  The Washington Post, how do we shut down Drudge Report?
[00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:06.756]  He gives too many links to Infowars and Daily Caller.
[00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:08.777]  Meanwhile, half their traffic comes from Drudge.
[00:39:08.997 --> 00:39:10.878]  We hate the very thing that lifts us up!
[00:39:12.618 --> 00:39:13.539]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:16.680]  Briefly, before I go back to David, he'll tell us what's coming up next segment.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.740]  He's got a lot to say on this.
[00:39:19.224 --> 00:39:22.727]  Please financially support InfoWars and get great products at the same time.
[00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:27.831]  We have a huge special on 67% off on Colloidal Silver.
[00:39:27.871 --> 00:39:28.611]  That's at cost.
[00:39:29.092 --> 00:39:31.253]  We have 57% off on SuperMetal Vitality.
[00:39:31.273 --> 00:39:35.116]  50% off on X3, the new, better formula than X2.
[00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:35.697]  It's amazing.
[00:39:36.197 --> 00:39:37.438]  And store-wide free shipping.
[00:39:37.818 --> 00:39:38.819]  That's on the Apparel.
[00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:41.461]  Alexa Pure Breeze, because they ordered too many.
[00:39:41.541 --> 00:39:43.123]  The very best gravity filter out there.
[00:39:43.723 --> 00:39:47.266]  David, I'm ranting here, and I'm going to let you roll next segment, because you've got a lot to say on this.
[00:40:09.065 --> 00:40:10.767]  How do you quantify what's happening here?
[00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:15.195]  This acceleration of the line on purpose in front of everyone.
[00:40:15.235 --> 00:40:15.876]  What is the point?
[00:40:17.264 --> 00:40:19.546]  Well Alex, one level is racketeering.
[00:40:20.027 --> 00:40:25.153]  It's racketeering by the mainstream media and it's racketeering by the social media oligarchs out of Silicon Valley.
[00:40:25.733 --> 00:40:27.635]  They're trying to demonetize any of their competition.
[00:40:27.655 --> 00:40:32.020]  You know, it was just yesterday they took away PayPal from BitChute.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.404]  And of course they tried to do that same thing with Gab, even take them off of the internet.
[00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:38.087]  So this is the level of persecution as you pointed out before.
[00:40:38.607 --> 00:40:42.169]  They're able to put out anything, no matter how obvious their lie.
[00:40:42.229 --> 00:40:45.571]  I mean, when they talk about this whole thing with Jim Acosta and say, he didn't touch her.
[00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:47.712]  No, look, you sped up the video and so forth.
[00:40:47.772 --> 00:40:49.793]  People can do their own experiment.
[00:40:49.893 --> 00:40:52.394]  Everybody's got video editors on their computer now.
[00:40:52.434 --> 00:40:57.897]  All they have to do is just take their original source and just zoom it in and put the two side by side and you can see how it looks.
[00:40:58.217 --> 00:40:59.438]  I mean, don't believe us.
[00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:00.598]  Don't believe your lying eyes.
[00:41:00.638 --> 00:41:02.840]  You don't believe CNN and the rest of the mainstream media.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.342]  It's absolutely amazing how these people collude together to push these lies.
[00:41:07.782 --> 00:41:09.944]  That's why we need people like Julian Assange.
[00:41:10.224 --> 00:41:15.747]  That's why we need people like John Kiriakou that I spoke to in the last half hour of my program.
[00:41:16.167 --> 00:41:18.809]  He's exposing the crimes of these people.
[00:41:19.753 --> 00:41:28.419]  You know, under the Espionage Act of 1917, Barack Obama locked up more people who were whistleblowers and journalists than all the presidents before him combined.
[00:41:29.218 --> 00:41:31.580]  And under that, they came after John Kiriakou.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.441]  And at the center of all that was John Brennan.
[00:41:33.701 --> 00:41:36.984]  After they arrested him, after the Bush administration said, no, he didn't do anything.
[00:41:37.124 --> 00:41:40.767]  We're going to look at whether or not his whistleblowing about torture violated any rules.
[00:41:40.807 --> 00:41:41.987]  They said, no, we're not going to prosecute him.
[00:41:42.428 --> 00:41:47.632]  Brennan gets in with Obama, and he found out with the memos that Brennan said, charge him with espionage.
[00:41:47.792 --> 00:41:49.393]  And they said, he didn't commit any espionage.
[00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:51.735]  They said, charge him with it anyway and make him defend himself.
[00:41:52.435 --> 00:41:53.076]  And what did he do?
[00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:55.238]  He went to these same people.
[00:41:55.679 --> 00:42:01.605]  Mueller, Strzok, ran a sting on him trying to get him involved and entrap him into an espionage thing.
[00:42:01.625 --> 00:42:02.125]  He didn't do it.
[00:42:02.165 --> 00:42:02.626]  He was honest.
[00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:03.166]  And they've done it.
[00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:04.688]  They did it to William Binney.
[00:42:04.708 --> 00:42:05.469]  They've tried it on me.
[00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:06.830]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.171]  When we come back, though...
[00:42:08.832 --> 00:42:12.213]  I was going to mention this in a segment, and you brought it up the key, what Rand Paul was hinting at.
[00:42:12.753 --> 00:42:14.554]  He goes, hey, people ought to build their own thing.
[00:42:14.794 --> 00:42:18.975]  They're trying to destroy every alternative to Facebook and Google.
[00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:20.816]  They're going after Brighteon.
[00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:22.236]  They're going after Infowars.
[00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:23.116]  They're going after us.
[00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:25.897]  That's why the listeners and viewers must stand with us more than ever.
[00:42:26.117 --> 00:42:29.198]  This is a fight for America and our very birthright, folks.
[00:42:29.238 --> 00:42:32.019]  We are fighting true international authoritarianism.
[00:42:32.499 --> 00:42:33.400]  Spread those live links.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.200]  That's how you fight back.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.700]  Stay with us.
[00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:48.183]  Questions are being asked about why the White House reposted what some say is a doctored video of the moment a White House intern tried to take the microphone from CNN's White House correspondent.
[00:42:48.303 --> 00:42:56.072]  The White House is under fire today for reposting what some say is doctored video of CNN's Jim Acosta and his tug-of-war with an intern.
[00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:56.913]  That's enough.
[00:42:56.933 --> 00:42:57.534]  Put down the mic.
[00:42:57.714 --> 00:43:02.099]  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has been accused of sharing fake news.
[00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:03.120]  Here's what happened.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.743]  President Trump held a press conference yesterday.
[00:43:05.763 --> 00:43:06.765]  A lot of people saw this.
[00:43:06.785 --> 00:43:09.748]  He got heated back and forth with Jim Acosta of CNN.
[00:43:09.788 --> 00:43:13.012]  And that spat cost Jim Acosta his press pass.
[00:43:13.272 --> 00:43:14.894]  For real, he's not allowed in the White House anymore.
[00:43:15.094 --> 00:43:17.576]  Acosta has now been banned from the White House.
[00:43:17.696 --> 00:43:21.938]  I tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them.
[00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:24.480]  You are a rude, terrible person.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.241]  You shouldn't be working for CNN.
[00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:37.028]  Breaking right now, the White House has just revoked CNN's chief White House correspondent's credentials, press credentials, after his despicable behavior at today's news conference.
[00:43:37.108 --> 00:43:44.578]  You know, I didn't put my hands on her or touch her, as they're alleging, and it's just unfortunate that the White House is saying this.
[00:43:44.859 --> 00:43:49.205]  The intern reaches for the mic, and there he goes, and hi-yah!
[00:43:50.609 --> 00:44:00.355]  What the allegation is that the video was doctored to pause it for three frames so it looks like he sort of chops down on her arm in sort of an aggressive motion.
[00:44:00.495 --> 00:44:07.179]  They altered this video and take a look here and you see like they sped up his hand.
[00:44:09.238 --> 00:44:11.279]  Mr. President, if I may ask one other question.
[00:44:11.299 --> 00:44:11.740]  Are you worried?
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.300]  That's enough.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.722]  That's enough.
[00:44:16.023 --> 00:44:18.925]  And the White House press secretary tweeted this video.
[00:44:19.045 --> 00:44:21.626]  And where did the White House get that doctored video?
[00:44:21.706 --> 00:44:28.671]  It appears to have originated with the far-right conspiracy site InfoWars, which is a website for the mentally unbalanced.
[00:44:28.691 --> 00:44:31.213]  So that is Sanders' reliable source.
[00:44:31.253 --> 00:44:35.616]  Trouble is, the video came from the far-right wing conspiracy website InfoWars.
[00:44:35.876 --> 00:44:44.678]  CNN is fake news, and to prove it, here's a video from a reputable news source that believes the government is putting plastic liners in juice boxes to turn our sons into gay frogs.
[00:44:45.798 --> 00:44:48.278]  InfoWars denies it doctored the video.
[00:44:48.418 --> 00:44:59.340]  The video originally appears to have come originally from a conspiracy theorist by the name of Paul Joseph Watson, and he's a British guy who works for the website InfoWars.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.320]  Zooming in isn't doctoring.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.561]  Look at the comparison between the original video
[00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:06.402]  And the one I posted.
[00:45:06.642 --> 00:45:07.622]  It isn't doctored.
[00:45:07.822 --> 00:45:08.643]  It isn't sped up.
[00:45:09.103 --> 00:45:10.183]  It isn't slowed down.
[00:45:10.703 --> 00:45:12.464]  All I did was zoom in.
[00:45:12.484 --> 00:45:13.545]  It wasn't doctored.
[00:45:13.845 --> 00:45:15.285]  They gave a close-up view.
[00:45:15.505 --> 00:45:16.466]  That's not doctoring.
[00:45:16.686 --> 00:45:17.646]  That's not doctoring.
[00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:19.267]  That's showing even more clarity.
[00:45:19.607 --> 00:45:21.568]  That's enhancing for the truth.
[00:45:21.828 --> 00:45:23.969]  Here is the president defending Paul Watson just hours ago.
[00:45:24.269 --> 00:45:25.530]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.390]  Give me a break.
[00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.471]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:45:28.751 --> 00:45:30.072]  All that is is a close-up.
[00:45:30.652 --> 00:45:33.394]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:34.494]  I watched that.
[00:45:34.554 --> 00:45:35.615]  I heard that last night.
[00:45:35.935 --> 00:45:37.175]  They made it close-up.
[00:45:37.215 --> 00:45:38.376]  They showed it close-up.
[00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:39.897]  Now look at the original.
[00:45:40.017 --> 00:45:45.840]  Acosta's arm does make contact with the intern, but not as aggressively as in the InfoWars version.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.642]  They sped up Jim Acosta's hand movement to make it look more violent.
[00:45:49.662 --> 00:45:55.446]  This is all complete bulls**t. Because it wasn't doctored, they gave a close-up view.
[00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:58.708]  The White House is circulating a doctored InfoWallz video.
[00:45:58.728 --> 00:46:01.750]  White House press office also put out a doctored version of the video.
[00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.170]  Doctored.
[00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.830]  Doctored.
[00:46:02.931 --> 00:46:03.351]  Doctored.
[00:46:03.411 --> 00:46:04.311]  Doctored video.
[00:46:04.331 --> 00:46:05.292]  A doctored video.
[00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:06.893]  A doctored video.
[00:46:06.993 --> 00:46:09.235]  When you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:46:09.255 --> 00:46:14.538]  Why do you guys circulate obviously doctored videos and then allow the White House to spread misinformation?
[00:46:14.758 --> 00:46:15.838]  Uh, that video's not doctored.
[00:46:15.938 --> 00:46:16.559]  That was a lie.
[00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:17.459]  I don't know who told you that.
[00:46:17.499 --> 00:46:21.700]  There's literally overlays of them showing the original video over the edited video.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.741]  I didn't, uh, put my hands on her or touch her.
[00:46:24.821 --> 00:46:27.562]  I didn't, uh, put my hands on her or touch her.
[00:46:27.642 --> 00:46:30.383]  I didn't, uh, put my hands on her or touch her.
[00:46:30.403 --> 00:46:31.923]  I saw you with my own eyes!
[00:46:32.483 --> 00:46:34.224]  Well, who are you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?
[00:46:41.066 --> 00:46:43.787]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:59.091 --> 00:47:03.112]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:03.132 --> 00:47:04.953]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:05.193 --> 00:47:15.576]  So, what the corporate collaborator Globalist Press is doing is they know the world government's out in the open, they know they're getting rid of our freedoms, they know they're consolidating control of information all over the world.
[00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:19.537]  There's a global social score, market-to-beast system rolling out.
[00:47:19.557 --> 00:47:20.437]  It's in Reuters today.
[00:47:20.457 --> 00:47:22.078]  It's coming to Latin America.
[00:47:22.158 --> 00:47:23.038]  China's putting it in.
[00:47:23.878 --> 00:47:25.999]  Our own media and government's bringing it in as well.
[00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:26.799]  Trump's trying to block it.
[00:47:28.186 --> 00:47:38.380]  They create false consensus where all the corporate media says Jim Acosta didn't touch the woman, all the corporate media says Trump's in a war against the press when it was Obama, and they create a false consensus.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:45.249]  And there's another tactic, we're going to go to David Knight on this, there's another tactic where you don't want to be under the unelected TPP.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.861]  So they just say there is no TPP.
[00:47:48.201 --> 00:47:50.363]  Doesn't matter they're having negotiations on C-SPAN.
[00:47:50.643 --> 00:47:51.943]  Doesn't matter parts of it leak.
[00:47:52.544 --> 00:47:53.785]  They go, it doesn't exist.
[00:47:53.865 --> 00:47:55.666]  Crazy people say there's a TPP.
[00:47:56.346 --> 00:47:58.848]  And then Agenda 21 and something called globalism.
[00:47:59.408 --> 00:47:59.668]  Why?
[00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:05.652]  I mean the day after Trump got elected they had articles going, what is this term globalism and who made it up?
[00:48:05.672 --> 00:48:08.513]  And it was whole articles about it's insane, it doesn't exist.
[00:48:08.994 --> 00:48:11.595]  Doesn't matter there are thousands of books written about globalism.
[00:48:11.635 --> 00:48:13.737]  David Rockefeller called himself a globalist.
[00:48:14.457 --> 00:48:15.818]  They've been using the term for 50 years.
[00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:17.580]  Doesn't mean they want a global government.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.101]  It's here.
[00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:20.803]  But they just changed the subject.
[00:48:20.823 --> 00:48:26.669]  So, you're always debating whether or not it even exists instead of acting on it.
[00:48:26.749 --> 00:48:33.436]  Like, oh, massive censorship is being concerted for election meddling against nationalists and conservatives and others across the world.
[00:48:33.776 --> 00:48:34.957]  And it's admitted it's going on.
[00:48:35.859 --> 00:48:41.383]  And leaders of Google and others have done press conferences two years ago saying, Trump won, we're not going to let it happen again.
[00:48:41.684 --> 00:48:45.046]  And documents came out saying, we're going to suppress nationalists and conservatives.
[00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:47.869]  The good censorship, is what they called it.
[00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:52.552]  So, instead of having a debate in Congress, they just go up and deny it.
[00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:53.954]  The media denies it.
[00:48:54.853 --> 00:48:59.914]  Even as they call for it, and then the Senators go, well, okay, gee, you're not doing it?
[00:49:00.214 --> 00:49:09.097]  And everyone plays along like this isn't happening, because members of Congress know, if they really come out against this, they're going to be targeted.
[00:49:09.377 --> 00:49:13.418]  And everyone else is a coward, except Donald John Trump.
[00:49:13.838 --> 00:49:18.659]  Rand Paul starts to come out a little bit, and you guys ought to stop this, it's a little naughty now.
[00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:23.345]  You know, Matt Gaetz says, oh, you can censor whoever you want.
[00:49:23.506 --> 00:49:26.188]  They totally shadowed that in the next day because he green-lighted it.
[00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:29.631]  Everyone thinks you're going to pat this authoritarianism on the head.
[00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:37.278]  It's a global authoritarian race by the Chai-coms and the big tech companies, the big banks and the EU and others.
[00:49:37.298 --> 00:49:38.479]  There's a big global race.
[00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:41.021]  And our military is not even involved in that race.
[00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:43.623]  So Google's like, we're not even going to talk to you or help you.
[00:49:43.723 --> 00:49:44.204]  Shut up.
[00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:47.567]  Total disrespect of our country and of everything.
[00:49:48.814 --> 00:49:52.138]  And here comes Trump saying, this is a bad deal, why are we acting like chumps?
[00:49:52.558 --> 00:49:58.625]  And all these traders and sellouts go, oh, he's the bad guy, get rid of him and Alex Jones and any of his supporters.
[00:49:58.645 --> 00:49:59.146]  Well, you know what?
[00:50:00.287 --> 00:50:01.769]  I'm not sticking my neck out for Trump.
[00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.094]  I'm sticking it out for my own family and everybody else because I'm not sticking it out.
[00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.557]  Sticking your neck out is going along with this.
[00:50:08.577 --> 00:50:09.217]  That's crazy.
[00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.232]  So, shame on all the cowards out there.
[00:50:12.633 --> 00:50:18.279]  I want to get David Knight's take on this, but here's President Trump again last week saying that's not doctoring.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.584]  And again, he's saying 2 plus 2 equals 4, which is a revolutionary act.
[00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:22.925]  Here it is.
[00:50:23.991 --> 00:50:26.354]  All that was, nobody manipulated it.
[00:50:26.394 --> 00:50:27.215]  Give me a break.
[00:50:27.555 --> 00:50:29.297]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:50:29.577 --> 00:50:30.899]  All that is, is a close-up.
[00:50:31.199 --> 00:50:34.222]  See, that's just, that is just dishonest reporting.
[00:50:34.643 --> 00:50:35.324]  I watched that.
[00:50:35.384 --> 00:50:36.445]  I heard that last night.
[00:50:36.765 --> 00:50:38.007]  They made it close-up.
[00:50:38.047 --> 00:50:39.208]  They showed it close-up.
[00:50:39.588 --> 00:50:41.570]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.551]  I don't hold him for that.
[00:50:43.332 --> 00:50:45.914]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[00:50:46.474 --> 00:50:49.936]  But all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:50:50.177 --> 00:50:51.417]  Because it wasn't doctored.
[00:50:51.738 --> 00:50:53.178]  They gave a close-up view.
[00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:54.419]  That's not doctoring.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.281]  A federal judge says Acosta's been abused.
[00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:07.788]  Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.
[00:51:08.308 --> 00:51:16.375]  Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying that attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim's belief.
[00:51:17.036 --> 00:51:20.018]  It's used by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
[00:51:20.478 --> 00:51:27.304]  We are watching the total gaslighting of the free world by naked tyrants, David Knight.
[00:51:27.404 --> 00:51:27.905]  What do we do?
[00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.431]  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:51:30.611 --> 00:51:34.855]  And they want to get back to the day when they just had ABC, CBS, NBC and NPR.
[00:51:35.435 --> 00:51:37.117]  And they could all say the same thing.
[00:51:37.157 --> 00:51:38.298]  They had the major newspapers.
[00:51:38.318 --> 00:51:39.779]  They would all say the same thing.
[00:51:39.859 --> 00:51:40.600]  Operation Mockingbird.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.441]  You know, the government would give them their talking points.
[00:51:42.502 --> 00:51:50.849]  If they wanted to retain access to the people who are powerful in Washington, then they would not buck that system.
[00:51:51.289 --> 00:51:55.254]  And now we've got new management at Fox News, and they want to be part of that system.
[00:51:55.334 --> 00:51:59.658]  And they have been invited by the new masters of our speech, the corporations.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.223]  One of the things that I find interesting about this, Alex, is that you've got the left
[00:52:05.097 --> 00:52:06.699]  Who hate all corporations.
[00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:12.865]  And you would think that they would be suspicious of the idea that we're going to let major corporations decide what we can and cannot say.
[00:52:13.025 --> 00:52:18.912]  And yet they fall in line because they're so blinded by their partisanship that they fall in line with this and they say, oh, that's a good thing.
[00:52:19.032 --> 00:52:20.373]  It's a private property and so forth.
[00:52:20.413 --> 00:52:20.834]  No, it's not.
[00:52:21.428 --> 00:52:24.550]  You know, as I said before, the White House is not the public square.
[00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:25.991]  Tucker Carlson's house is not the public square.
[00:52:26.011 --> 00:52:28.973]  The Supreme Court has ruled these companies are public square.
[00:52:29.153 --> 00:52:29.613]  They know it.
[00:52:29.893 --> 00:52:37.218]  Under law, they're protected from third-party stuff because they say they're a public commons and only criminal activity should be blocked.
[00:52:37.418 --> 00:52:40.380]  But they jump back and forth and Congress acts like they're ignorant.
[00:52:41.155 --> 00:52:45.316]  That's right, and we've had a Supreme Court decision back in 1946, Marsh v. Alabama.
[00:52:45.876 --> 00:52:55.639]  They threw a Jehovah's Witness off of a company-owned town, but they said, but she was standing in the public square of that town, and even if you own that privately, it's still the public square and you can't do that.
[00:52:55.659 --> 00:52:59.439]  They pretend that that doesn't happen now, even though Jack Dorsey said that he did that.
[00:52:59.459 --> 00:53:04.261]  You pointed out that Facebook said, well, we'll take off, we might take off President Trump back in 2017, earlier this year.
[00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:09.462]  We had Jack Dorsey at Twitter say, I might take Trump off of this.
[00:53:09.482 --> 00:53:19.085]  So we've got federal judges telling Trump that he can't remove trolls off of his personal account, his personal account, but that they can remove him off of the entire thing.
[00:53:19.205 --> 00:53:20.786]  That's what I think that...
[00:53:21.266 --> 00:53:26.330]  What they're saying is they're going to put a gag in our mouth, chain us up, and then let us get pilloried in the town square.
[00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:27.090]  This is how it works.
[00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:34.556]  I can't set foot on any of these big platforms where I'm being lied about, where I'm being attacked, where the Google searches are only giving the negative.
[00:53:34.896 --> 00:53:37.538]  I can't even respond when they call me a Nazi.
[00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:38.899]  You know, all these names.
[00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:42.781]  I can't even respond, and that's the key to the censorship.
[00:53:43.322 --> 00:53:47.765]  And then they want to take away this platform we have so our listeners can respond for us.
[00:53:48.045 --> 00:53:48.766]  My only voice
[00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:53.510]  David's only voice outside of this broadcast is you, listeners and viewers.
[00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.491]  And again, if they can get us, they can get everybody.
[00:53:55.531 --> 00:53:56.972]  This is an epic battle, folks.
[00:53:57.333 --> 00:53:58.434]  And everybody else is scared.
[00:53:58.474 --> 00:53:59.014]  I mean, I'll say it.
[00:53:59.855 --> 00:54:08.582]  Everybody else but Matt Drudge and Donald Trump and Alex Jones and David Knight and Tucker Carlson and a few others are willing to stand up.
[00:54:08.702 --> 00:54:09.603]  Everybody else is scared.
[00:54:10.003 --> 00:54:14.347]  And it's the instinct to be a slave is now taking this country over.
[00:54:14.647 --> 00:54:16.269]  And people praise us for standing up.
[00:54:16.929 --> 00:54:17.529]  Praise us!
[00:54:17.649 --> 00:54:19.030]  This is what you're supposed to do!
[00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:26.712]  You should instinctively be madder than a bull in a china shop over this type of raping of our birthright!
[00:54:27.072 --> 00:54:31.454]  Every time this happens, incredible horrors follow, guaranteed!
[00:54:31.694 --> 00:54:37.195]  The Chai-coms are working with the Dems to build total control grids in America!
[00:54:37.435 --> 00:54:38.796]  It's in Reuters today!
[00:54:39.096 --> 00:54:40.436]  Folks, we're in trouble!
[00:54:40.676 --> 00:54:42.397]  And everybody else goes, yeah, we're in trouble!
[00:54:42.617 --> 00:54:45.998]  Let's roll over and show our yellow bellies to the globalists!
[00:54:46.198 --> 00:54:48.921]  Not me, not what the hell is wrong with people!
[00:54:50.182 --> 00:54:51.704]  Let me tell you how bad this is, Alex.
[00:54:51.724 --> 00:55:03.916]  When I was talking to John Kiriakou, he pointed out that in 2014, Chuck Grassley, who is not just a senator, but he's head of the Judiciary Committee, he realized that they were illegally spying on him and on other people.
[00:55:04.616 --> 00:55:08.580]  And it was a crime, it was an order that was co-signed by Brennan and Clapper.
[00:55:09.381 --> 00:55:12.123]  Hold on, I'm going to hold you over.
[00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:18.887]  It didn't just create felonies every time, it's finally in the news confirming what we reported years ago, but it also violated the separation of powers.
[00:55:19.348 --> 00:55:24.451]  But it wasn't even the executive, it was its own rogue groups criminally spying on their overseers.
[00:55:25.552 --> 00:55:31.896]  And so what they did was, they committed a crime, and then they classified that crime and told him, you can't talk about it.
[00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:34.268]  Now, Grassley could have talked about it.
[00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:36.090]  He didn't have the courage to talk about it.
[00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.191]  He had immunity.
[00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:39.192]  He could have talked about it and not be prosecuted.
[00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:42.775]  People like John Kiriakou did not have immunity.
[00:55:42.875 --> 00:55:43.575]  And he talked about it.
[00:55:43.755 --> 00:55:44.496]  He went to jail.
[00:55:44.596 --> 00:55:47.398]  And they tried to give him a plea bargain.
[00:55:47.418 --> 00:55:48.139]  He said, I'm not going to do it.
[00:55:48.159 --> 00:55:49.640]  I didn't violate any laws here.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.201]  And they said, we're just trying to minimize damage.
[00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:52.702]  And that's what Grassley's doing.
[00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:55.164]  So for four years, he was silent about it.
[00:55:55.544 --> 00:56:01.269]  And then he got the new people in the administration and CIA or whatever to declassify it.
[00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.310]  So he talks about it.
[00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:04.332]  Nobody covers it, basically, on November 1st.
[00:56:04.352 --> 00:56:05.073]  But that is the good news.
[00:56:05.113 --> 00:56:06.314]  Because of all the Khashoggi stuff.
[00:56:06.874 --> 00:56:11.218]  That Grassley was intimidated for years, but now that Trump's in, Trump's really trying to reform this.
[00:56:11.458 --> 00:56:12.319]  That's another example.
[00:56:12.379 --> 00:56:15.542]  I mean, I don't think we can really... But there's no courage, even in the Senate.
[00:56:16.701 --> 00:56:20.729]  I don't think we can over quantify how special Trump is.
[00:56:20.989 --> 00:56:22.111]  I mean, that's why they're so scared of him.
[00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:24.042]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:24.342 --> 00:56:27.364]  I mean, we've got to have the situation as you're pointing out.
[00:56:27.944 --> 00:56:29.726]  It's not dangerous to stand up to these people.
[00:56:29.746 --> 00:56:31.367]  It's dangerous to not stand up to them.
[00:56:32.047 --> 00:56:35.309]  It's even greater for us if we capitulate to this.
[00:56:35.649 --> 00:56:40.353]  And when we talk about free press and free speech, we have to understand that there's a difference.
[00:56:40.373 --> 00:56:44.335]  You know, when we talk about the free press, it's what you are allowed to see and hear, right?
[00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:47.557]  But also, they're coming after free speech.
[00:56:47.858 --> 00:56:52.741]  And that is what they're doing on social media when they try to gag President Trump as an individual citizen.
[00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:57.105]  Or when they gag millions of people, taking them off of social media.
[00:56:57.145 --> 00:57:02.791]  We've got an organization out there that is working with the DCC, the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee.
[00:57:03.252 --> 00:57:05.414]  They bragged about the fact they banned 10,000.
[00:57:05.454 --> 00:57:11.920]  They said, we've got another 80,000 to 90,000 that we're going to ban as well because we just call them bots or we say they're hateful or whatever.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.541]  Stay right there.
[00:57:12.561 --> 00:57:13.802]  This is SPLC.
[00:57:14.163 --> 00:57:15.044]  David, this is so critical.
[00:57:15.644 --> 00:57:18.307]  Just six months ago, they said, oh, people are violating rules or terms.
[00:57:18.327 --> 00:57:20.829]  Now they just say, we don't like any nationalists or conservatives.
[00:57:21.009 --> 00:57:22.570]  We're going to ban hundreds of thousands now.
[00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:26.073]  And they have security meetings in Berlin with the CIA bragging about it.
[00:57:27.695 --> 00:57:32.899]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:57:35.143 --> 00:57:36.704]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:37.345]  It's a good thing.
[00:57:37.385 --> 00:57:40.587]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:43.489]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:57:43.529 --> 00:57:44.670]  I learned what the best was.
[00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:58.600]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:04.064]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:58:04.244 --> 00:58:08.710]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.593]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:58:12.234 --> 00:58:16.620]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:19.972]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:58:20.753 --> 00:58:23.034]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[00:58:23.054 --> 00:58:30.459]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.381]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[00:58:33.962 --> 00:58:35.963]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:36.924]  Texas has that too.
[00:58:37.424 --> 00:58:41.187]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[00:58:41.767 --> 00:58:44.569]  So, he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:51.111]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[00:58:51.471 --> 00:58:53.552]  We normally sell for $249, it's a great deal.
[00:58:54.152 --> 00:58:57.373]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[00:58:57.653 --> 00:58:57.953]  It's $127.
[00:58:58.674 --> 00:59:02.475]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:59:03.342 --> 00:59:04.503]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[00:59:04.563 --> 00:59:06.644]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[00:59:06.684 --> 00:59:07.664]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[00:59:07.824 --> 00:59:08.885]  This is insane.
[00:59:09.225 --> 00:59:10.986]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:59:11.406 --> 00:59:13.387]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[00:59:13.407 --> 00:59:14.788]  Get the best, the best deal.
[00:59:15.168 --> 00:59:17.389]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:18.009]  It's amazing.
[00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:24.133]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:31.718 --> 00:59:34.719]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:59:34.819 --> 00:59:35.439]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:59:53.693 --> 01:00:17.685]  You know, David Knight and I are just apoplectic because it's so insanely obvious that there is a global corporate takeover destroying speech everywhere and we can't seem to
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:22.156]  Get the general public to realize how much danger they're in.
[01:00:22.176 --> 01:00:23.116]  The president gets it.
[01:00:23.736 --> 01:00:24.517]  He understands it.
[01:00:24.597 --> 01:00:26.117]  And then he's under incredible attack.
[01:00:26.537 --> 01:00:33.880]  And now because we've got Trump in there and other nationalists are getting elected, the authoritarians are throwing everything they've got against us now.
[01:00:35.561 --> 01:00:39.722]  And it's basically going to cause a quickening of the authoritarianism.
[01:00:40.642 --> 01:00:42.503]  And maybe that's a good thing, because it'll wake people up.
[01:00:42.603 --> 01:00:43.283]  I don't know, David.
[01:00:43.383 --> 01:00:44.964]  Other points on all this.
[01:00:45.865 --> 01:00:49.749]  Well, you know, Alex, we're talking about what's happening in Florida and Georgia, Arizona and so forth.
[01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:52.211]  These guys don't give up when they lose an election.
[01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:53.693]  They're not giving up about Brexit.
[01:00:53.713 --> 01:00:55.735]  They're not giving up about President Trump's election.
[01:00:56.095 --> 01:00:56.816]  They never quit!
[01:00:57.674 --> 01:01:02.276]  But they are able to use the media and the connections that they have there.
[01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:12.881]  You know, as I was saying before, it's strange to see the left saying, we're going to allow these giant corporations to censor everybody's speech and decide what you're going to be able to say and not say.
[01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:21.964]  And they accept that because these big corporations are saying, we're with you on political correctness, we're with you on the transgender agenda, or whatever, or any kind of identity politics stuff.
[01:01:21.984 --> 01:01:23.125]  Yeah, we check all those boxes.
[01:01:23.465 --> 01:01:34.609]  However, what they don't realize is that they're also working hand-in-glove with the military-industrial complex, with NATO, with the Atlantic Council, and all these neocons that are out there.
[01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:37.390]  They're also running this because they are also globalists.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:45.473]  So, this whole thing about identity politics and political correctness that Silicon Valley buys into, that puts a nice veneer on it for the left, and they like that.
[01:01:45.533 --> 01:01:49.815]  They want people censored on the basis of that, but they don't realize that the larger issue here
[01:01:50.595 --> 01:02:05.509]  Is that the globalists are coming back against everybody that's defeating them, whether it's in Britain with the UK, Brexit, or whether it's President Trump, or whether it's some of these other countries that are trying to defend themselves, as we saw with Emmanuel Macron last week.
[01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:11.791]  Uh, pushing back against anybody who wants to have some say-so and control over their lives.
[01:02:11.831 --> 01:02:16.053]  So they will use any tactic, any technique, and these people are just embracing that.
[01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:22.095]  It's absolutely amazing to see this tyranny where they're able to come after people and they're, as I said before, they're bragging about it.
[01:02:22.296 --> 01:02:23.636]  We're not going to stop at social media.
[01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:26.077]  We're not going to stop until we demonetize people.
[01:02:26.337 --> 01:02:30.479]  We're not going to stop until we absolutely kick off their websites off of the internet.
[01:02:31.906 --> 01:02:33.046]  David, we know where they're going.
[01:02:33.106 --> 01:02:34.147]  It's in Reuters today.
[01:02:34.387 --> 01:02:36.187]  We first broke this almost six years ago.
[01:02:36.247 --> 01:02:40.929]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens.
[01:02:41.489 --> 01:02:45.950]  And the Chinese government, Chinese telecom giant, is building Venezuela's social credit system.
[01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.751]  This is the global system.
[01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:48.871]  China is exporting it.
[01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:50.972]  Google and others are working with them.
[01:02:51.532 --> 01:02:53.692]  And Google won't even work with the Pentagon now.
[01:02:53.752 --> 01:02:56.713]  The decision has been made to go with authoritarianism.
[01:02:57.313 --> 01:02:58.674]  And if Trump can stop this,
[01:02:59.713 --> 01:03:01.617]  He can stop the entire global takeover.
[01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:03.841]  This must be stopped now.
[01:03:04.523 --> 01:03:07.449]  This system is the beginning of the end.
[01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.773]  And if we can't hold the line here, there is no hope.
[01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.680]  You know, Alex, you said Google won't work with the Pentagon and so forth.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:21.426]  They won't show up for congressional hearings, just like Clapper and Brennan won't show up when they're asked to come in and talk about it.
[01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:28.591]  These are the people who really are the government, because they can tell the senators, hey, we're not going to work with you, we're not going to work with the Pentagon, we're not going to work with the senators.
[01:03:28.911 --> 01:03:29.912]  We're in charge here.
[01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:34.175]  The corporations and the CIA that are running this situation.
[01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:40.998]  And that's what's so scary about all this stuff, is that the American people are not getting some of this information.
[01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:46.220]  Even when you have this simple little thing with Jim Acosta and President Trump, it is so obvious, it's so apparent.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.182]  You can see the video, they can run the experiment themselves, do it on their own editor.
[01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:55.744]  Everybody's got a little iMovie editor on their computer, or the equivalent on PCs.
[01:03:55.784 --> 01:04:03.808]  They can prove it to themselves, but they're not interested enough, or they don't have enough time, and they only hear that same echo chamber that is coming out over and over again.
[01:04:06.772 --> 01:04:15.798]  That's what, so... David Knight, great job, and you are here every weekday morning from 8am to 11am Central Standard Time.
[01:04:16.438 --> 01:04:20.321]  And folks can follow everything you're doing there at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:26.485]  And of course, you've got your own big Twitter account that you haven't banned yet, you've had for many years, at Libertarian.
[01:04:26.865 --> 01:04:29.047]  So God bless you, David, great job, have a great weekend.
[01:04:29.787 --> 01:04:30.728]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:04:30.748 --> 01:04:31.809]  All right, we're going to come back.
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.571]  I got so much, I don't know where to start.
[01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:36.392]  Just stay with us.
[01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:41.616]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:42.196]  Go ahead.
[01:04:42.456 --> 01:04:48.057]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:49.338]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:04:49.618 --> 01:04:52.078]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:04:52.098 --> 01:04:53.659]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:04:53.699 --> 01:04:54.339]  I was exhausted.
[01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:57.940]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.901]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:05:02.981 --> 01:05:05.002]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:05.062 --> 01:05:05.562]  Same thing.
[01:05:05.742 --> 01:05:07.823]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:05:07.923 --> 01:05:09.144]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:05:09.324 --> 01:05:11.166]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:05:11.426 --> 01:05:17.430]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:18.571]  You can sleep with it.
[01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:23.174]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:05:23.234 --> 01:05:26.036]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:27.897]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:28.697]  It really works.
[01:05:28.937 --> 01:05:33.460]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:05:35.742 --> 01:05:36.102]  Believe me.
[01:05:42.167 --> 01:05:48.152]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.223]  When I grow up, I want to have a human future for our species.
[01:06:02.263 --> 01:06:04.985]  Not a post-human world already set up by the globalists.
[01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:07.215]  We now take you live to that fight.
[01:06:07.895 --> 01:06:13.997]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:14.378 --> 01:06:18.759]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:22.561]  We are the heart of the resistance because other people were scared.
[01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:24.382]  Or they thought, how do you do that?
[01:06:24.442 --> 01:06:26.083]  How do you build your own radio TV network?
[01:06:26.403 --> 01:06:27.123]  How do you resist?
[01:06:27.543 --> 01:06:29.144]  How do you get a populist president elected?
[01:06:29.224 --> 01:06:29.804]  Well, we did it.
[01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:30.244]  You did it.
[01:06:30.705 --> 01:06:31.385]  The audience did it.
[01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:32.185]  Our affiliates did it.
[01:06:32.565 --> 01:06:33.326]  Our sponsors did it.
[01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:33.926]  God did it.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.101]  And now here we are, under total attack.
[01:06:38.582 --> 01:06:43.926]  The enemy was arrogant before, the corporate press, because they wanted all the advertising money.
[01:06:43.946 --> 01:06:44.706]  We didn't even care about it.
[01:06:45.087 --> 01:06:47.068]  Tried to act like talk radio didn't exist.
[01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.530]  We only had a bigger audience than all corporate news combined.
[01:06:50.811 --> 01:06:57.156]  And then finally, when Hillary lost, and they saw populist winning all over the world, they said, that's it, shut the free speech down now.
[01:06:57.176 --> 01:06:58.897]  And they go, that'll wake them up faster.
[01:06:59.377 --> 01:07:00.998]  No, we'll just deny it to Congress.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.521]  Which is its own giant scandal.
[01:07:04.761 --> 01:07:05.122]  And you know,
[01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:10.516]  Out of the 25 members of the EU, only two countries ever had votes to enter the EU.
[01:07:11.136 --> 01:07:12.357]  And they thought those were trade deals.
[01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:21.305]  Just like the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the North American Union was supposed to be the Trans-American Partnership.
[01:07:21.365 --> 01:07:22.226]  All these different systems.
[01:07:25.659 --> 01:07:26.799]  North American trade deals.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.460]  They're really signing your sovereignty over these international corporate boards.
[01:07:32.121 --> 01:07:45.804]  And the EU is there to suck Europe dry, get rid of the nation-states in their own words, and now set up an EU army we first talked about decades ago to block any nation-states trying to pull out during the financial implosion of the nations.
[01:07:46.224 --> 01:07:54.106]  And then third world populations are brought in and weaponized, put on welfare, so they can burn down any city at the snap of a finger.
[01:07:57.876 --> 01:08:00.438]  And the journey towards total enslavement is then complete.
[01:08:01.939 --> 01:08:10.904]  So Paul Watson, who is a member of UKIP and works on their strategy committee, has been for the last two days at Parliament non-stop.
[01:08:10.944 --> 01:08:12.605]  He came back last night, filed this report.
[01:08:12.665 --> 01:08:13.506]  I just talked to him earlier.
[01:08:13.526 --> 01:08:16.047]  We're gonna be getting him on the show.
[01:08:17.368 --> 01:08:18.629]  But there are big developments.
[01:08:19.659 --> 01:08:24.182]  And just like they do here, we vote something in, they just then ignore it.
[01:08:24.822 --> 01:08:27.464]  The swamp and the bureaucracy just ignores it.
[01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.387]  So Paul's filed a report, The Truth About Brexit.
[01:08:32.787 --> 01:08:38.391]  Then we're going to get into illegal aliens funded by the U.N.
[01:08:38.431 --> 01:08:41.213]  called migrants are scaling the U.S.-Mexico fence.
[01:08:41.373 --> 01:08:42.133]  Will they be arrested?
[01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:44.335]  Our reporters have just arrived on the scene.
[01:08:44.855 --> 01:08:47.257]  That's going to be coming up later live as well.
[01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:56.214]  Also, illegal aliens are involved in more vicious crimes, rapes, shootouts with police, and the media won't even say they're illegal.
[01:08:56.394 --> 01:09:01.236]  But we found the evidence, and we have the shocking dash cam video of that coming up.
[01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:08.939]  But Camilla Harris of the Democrat from California, a member of Congress, she says any border is KKK.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.340]  That is all
[01:09:11.636 --> 01:09:18.139]  Coming up, and the big news, is the world system that's now being put in place for the cashless society.
[01:09:18.159 --> 01:09:20.821]  Reuters is now reporting on it.
[01:09:23.962 --> 01:09:29.745]  Meanwhile, National Guard soldier arrested, charged with smuggling Mexican nationals into the U.S.
[01:09:29.845 --> 01:09:31.806]  Yes, the treason runs deep.
[01:09:33.007 --> 01:09:37.229]  The treason of people involved in human smuggling and selling the nation out.
[01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:40.711]  It's big business doing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:44.554 --> 01:09:45.375]  It's all coming up.
[01:09:45.475 --> 01:09:50.599]  Please don't forget newswars.com, presentplanet.com, infowars.com.
[01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:56.124]  Those are the sites the globalists work around the clock to try to ban and block.
[01:09:56.224 --> 01:09:56.404]  Why?
[01:09:58.732 --> 01:10:08.842]  Because we're pointing out that our country's under attack, and the globalists that are coming in are totally authoritarian, don't pay taxes, and are above the law, and it's a nightmare system.
[01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:14.427]  We're not just getting conquered by something that's better, we're being conquered by something absolutely horrible.
[01:10:15.984 --> 01:10:17.185]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:10:18.026 --> 01:10:26.674]  And then Communist China officially moves in to Latin America with the global ID system and the cashless society, mark of the beast, social credit system.
[01:10:27.034 --> 01:10:28.075]  Reuters is even reporting it.
[01:10:28.116 --> 01:10:33.561]  But first, here is Paul Joseph Watson's report, The Truth About Brexit.
[01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:39.867]  Some will say, well see, they passed it three years ago and it's blocked and the bureaucrats won't do it.
[01:10:41.348 --> 01:10:45.111]  Ten years ago, you couldn't get people to even admit that the UK was in the EU.
[01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:45.952]  They did it by stealth.
[01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:49.896]  And five years ago, people didn't believe that they never voted to not be part of it.
[01:10:51.597 --> 01:10:53.139]  And then three years ago, they voted to get out of it.
[01:10:53.179 --> 01:10:54.340]  Now they're saying you can't get out of it.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.303]  That's the beginning of the end, once people learn they're ruled by outside, unelected powers.
[01:10:58.644 --> 01:10:59.925]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:11:00.717 --> 01:11:05.499]  Let's just be honest, this whole thing was designed to fail from the very beginning.
[01:11:05.579 --> 01:11:09.681]  Theresa May never intended to dignify the referendum result.
[01:11:09.801 --> 01:11:13.663]  I warned that they were going to stab us all in the back from day one.
[01:11:13.723 --> 01:11:16.725]  Theresa May deliberately negotiated a crappy deal.
[01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:21.967]  Knowing it would be rejected so as to create the pretext for cancelling Brexit.
[01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:32.031]  If you enter into a negotiation with no limits on the length to which you'll compromise, that's not a negotiation, that's a capitulation, that's surrender.
[01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:36.333]  From the start, this has been one long process in managed surrender.
[01:11:36.453 --> 01:11:43.176]  My right honourable friend, and she is unquestionably honourable, said that we would leave the customs union.
[01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:46.417]  Annex 2 says otherwise.
[01:11:47.256 --> 01:11:51.260]  My Right Honourable Friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom.
[01:11:52.161 --> 01:11:54.383]  A whole protocol says otherwise.
[01:11:55.304 --> 01:12:00.429]  My Right Honourable Friend said that we would be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
[01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.670]  Article 174 says otherwise.
[01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:10.008]  That's what my right honourable friend says, and what my right honourable friend does no longer match.
[01:12:10.309 --> 01:12:11.230]  This is not Brexit.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.372]  This is a failure of government policy.
[01:12:13.452 --> 01:12:14.513]  It needs to be rejected.
[01:12:14.533 --> 01:12:22.740]  I mean, for God's sake, her chief negotiator, the guy cutting the deal, Ollie Robbins, was a staunch communist who defended Stalin.
[01:12:23.021 --> 01:12:24.222]  What did you expect?
[01:12:24.722 --> 01:12:30.487]  Theresa May is threatening no Brexit whatsoever if her sh** sandwich of a deal gets rejected.
[01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:31.528]  Which it will!
[01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:33.169]  And that was the plan all along.
[01:12:33.429 --> 01:12:37.613]  I knew this is what would happen because it's a tried and tested EU model.
[01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:41.396]  Give people the illusion of choice, the facsimile of democracy.
[01:12:41.476 --> 01:12:42.177]  Let them vote.
[01:12:42.277 --> 01:12:46.040]  But if their vote defies the EU, just sabotage the process.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.763]  Or make them vote again and again and again until you get the result you want.
[01:12:50.944 --> 01:13:01.752]  Citizens across the continent voted to reject the Maastricht Treaty, to reject the Nice Treaty, to reject the EU Constitution, to reject the Lisbon Treaty, to reject the Euro bailout.
[01:13:01.952 --> 01:13:09.295]  Every time the votes were ignored, emphasizing the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the European Union.
[01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:17.199]  We are being asked to sign up to a deal that doesn't really give us Brexit, that portrays the greatest democratic exercise in this country.
[01:13:17.239 --> 01:13:21.281]  But I have to say, tonight, I'm feeling more optimistic.
[01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:23.463]  I'm seeing the resignations.
[01:13:24.003 --> 01:13:32.031]  I think we're getting close to the end of the worst and most duplicitous Prime Minister in British history and that will give us a chance for a fresh start.
[01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:38.758]  This is also about punishing the UK to intimidate other European countries out of pursuing their own form of Brexit.
[01:13:38.778 --> 01:13:43.843]  This is nothing less than a complete and total betrayal of democracy.
[01:13:44.403 --> 01:13:48.586]  Vote to sign up to everything under a different name and be the EU's bitch.
[01:13:48.886 --> 01:13:51.187]  We voted to leave the EU.
[01:13:51.328 --> 01:13:54.129]  This deal de facto keeps us in the EU.
[01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:59.413]  But with no say and no influence, it turns us into a slave state.
[01:13:59.653 --> 01:14:03.938]  And on top of that, we're handing over £39 billion for the privilege.
[01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:05.920]  We're the prostitutes in this exchange.
[01:14:05.961 --> 01:14:08.103]  We're the ones getting bent over and screwed.
[01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:09.605]  Yet we're paying them.
[01:14:09.705 --> 01:14:14.230]  This deal is so awful that we'd be better off staying in the EU.
[01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:16.373]  And that was the plan all along.
[01:14:16.573 --> 01:14:21.516]  Now they're going to push for a second referendum which includes the option of cancelling Brexit.
[01:14:21.596 --> 01:14:27.881]  An option that will serve as a death sentence for the very notion of Great Britain as a democratic country.
[01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:37.767]  Having stuck in the knife May and her globalist cabal are now twisting it by putting the country at risk of the chilling prospect of being ruled by Jeremy Corbyn.
[01:14:37.867 --> 01:14:43.771]  A terrorist sympathiser who thinks that Venezuela's socialist dystopia is a model for the world.
[01:14:46.513 --> 01:14:55.296]  We either vote for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom.
[01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:56.077]  That's the choice.
[01:14:56.117 --> 01:15:00.879]  Theresa May never represented the interests of the United Kingdom to begin with.
[01:15:01.259 --> 01:15:03.580]  So how on earth is she still in power?
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.220]  This is it.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.262]  This is our last chance to appoint a leader whose loyalties lie with their country.
[01:15:09.582 --> 01:15:12.845]  Not with a gaggle of odious technocrats in Brussels.
[01:15:12.905 --> 01:15:18.029]  This is the last chance for Britain to avoid disappearing down a hard left hellhole.
[01:15:18.109 --> 01:15:22.352]  This is the last chance for Britain to avoid a constitutional crisis.
[01:15:22.513 --> 01:15:25.575]  This is sovereignty on the chopping block.
[01:15:25.715 --> 01:15:28.958]  This is democracy hanging by a thread.
[01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:40.732]  There's only three days left for the Mega Sale.
[01:15:41.152 --> 01:15:43.274]  67% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:15:43.374 --> 01:15:45.396]  And don't forget, free shipping storewide.
[01:15:45.456 --> 01:15:46.998]  That all ends in just three days.
[01:15:53.524 --> 01:15:58.286]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[01:15:58.326 --> 01:16:15.295]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[01:16:15.795 --> 01:16:16.436]  But is it true?
[01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:23.842]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[01:16:24.823 --> 01:16:28.367]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[01:16:29.327 --> 01:16:30.709]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[01:16:30.729 --> 01:16:33.852]  And so the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[01:16:34.412 --> 01:16:39.835]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[01:16:40.075 --> 01:16:40.655]  to 3 p.m.
[01:16:40.695 --> 01:16:41.636]  just on my show.
[01:16:41.736 --> 01:16:44.297]  And you got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[01:16:44.337 --> 01:16:44.677]  Central.
[01:16:45.117 --> 01:16:48.539]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:16:48.579 --> 01:16:49.199]  in the War Room.
[01:16:49.419 --> 01:16:51.420]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.601]  They're trying to block that.
[01:16:53.513 --> 01:16:57.316]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[01:16:57.976 --> 01:17:05.121]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.143]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[01:17:08.923 --> 01:17:23.873]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online, kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube, and over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[01:17:24.413 --> 01:17:32.459]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from, trying to shut us down.
[01:17:32.519 --> 01:17:34.540]  That's because we are on target.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.762]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:38.663]  We're exposing their main operation.
[01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:40.765]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[01:17:41.205 --> 01:17:42.066]  That's why you've supported us.
[01:17:42.126 --> 01:17:48.273]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:17:49.454 --> 01:17:51.396]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:55.420]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:08.502]  When we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever, to hand-share those links, to text message people, information you think is particularly important, to get around the censors.
[01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:09.903]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[01:18:10.383 --> 01:18:13.923]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[01:18:14.163 --> 01:18:16.984]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[01:18:17.044 --> 01:18:23.265]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best-rated, best-selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:26.491]  Water filtration.
[01:18:26.592 --> 01:18:27.293]  Air filtration.
[01:18:27.394 --> 01:18:28.937]  Non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:18:29.399 --> 01:18:31.163]  They're all there at TheFloorStore.com.
[01:18:31.183 --> 01:18:31.824]  Patriot apparel.
[01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:32.927]  It's all there.
[01:18:34.226 --> 01:18:46.674]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:46.774 --> 01:18:59.422]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[01:19:00.342 --> 01:19:03.264]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[01:19:03.664 --> 01:19:08.067]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[01:19:08.107 --> 01:19:09.928]  So please take advantage of them today.
[01:19:10.028 --> 01:19:14.891]  M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.652]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[01:19:16.672 --> 01:19:18.113]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[01:19:18.514 --> 01:19:18.854]  3% off.

[01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:21.516]  Highest quality.

[01:19:22.016 --> 01:19:22.516]  Silver Bullet.

[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:36.444]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[01:19:41.546 --> 01:19:44.168]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:00.686 --> 01:20:04.337]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:04.859 --> 01:20:06.263]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.726 --> 01:20:29.273]  So, the caravan that two weeks ago tore down and smashed through Mexican border defenses, running over their military and riot police, injuring many of them, some of them with firearms and Molotov cocktail firebombs, has made it in the last 48 hours, the first vanguard, bussed in.
[01:20:29.853 --> 01:20:32.334]  Would have taken over 100 days for them to get there at 10 miles a day.
[01:20:33.752 --> 01:20:40.676]  But they were bussed in lavishly by UNICEF and by USAID, the State Department funding George Soros.
[01:20:40.716 --> 01:20:41.336]  That's public.
[01:20:42.877 --> 01:20:46.319]  And now they're beginning to mash and promising and taunting military the last two days.
[01:20:46.599 --> 01:20:50.141]  We played the video yesterday saying in Spanish, we're going to run over you.
[01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:51.062]  We are coming.
[01:20:51.622 --> 01:20:52.682]  You will not stop us.
[01:20:52.763 --> 01:20:53.363]  We are here.
[01:20:54.807 --> 01:21:00.470]  And so the first end of the tentacle, the first tip of the spear, has now hit.
[01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:07.513]  And we have two of our reporters that are on the scene, live reports, coming up at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:21:07.533 --> 01:21:10.314]  We're going to be asking locals what they think of what's going on.
[01:21:10.334 --> 01:21:15.556]  We're going to be going and talking to some of the invaders about who's funding them and what's going on.
[01:21:16.077 --> 01:21:21.159]  And we're also going to be, again, showing that imaginary caravan that does not exist.
[01:21:21.559 --> 01:21:22.580]  There's footage from two days ago.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.440]  It does not exist.
[01:21:25.287 --> 01:21:28.368]  And of course, on the news, people are actually climbing over, being allowed to climb over.
[01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:30.029]  The military's not engaging them yet.
[01:21:30.049 --> 01:21:31.329]  Because you can't do that!
[01:21:31.989 --> 01:21:33.710]  Why, that's KKK behavior!
[01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:51.876]  According to Camilla Harris, the Democrat from California, a member of Congress, there's a parallel between ICE and the KKK, even though ICE is about half Hispanic, even though Latin America's collapsed, even though all the countries around Venezuela put up fences because it's collapsed, into a total hellhole.
[01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:56.091]  But don't worry, they have a digital Mark of the Beast that's coming in this week.
[01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.952]  I have the article here, next segment.
[01:21:59.634 --> 01:22:00.274]  No, no, no, no.
[01:22:00.314 --> 01:22:18.608]  There's a nice corridor set up by the UN into our country with the Democrats waiting with open arms in California, covered in human feces and needles and out-of-control crime and ash raining down out of the sky and all the corruption, while she says it's the KKK if we have a border.
[01:22:18.989 --> 01:22:20.229]  Mexico has a border with us.
[01:22:22.579 --> 01:22:33.883]  There's a border with Central America, with Guatemala and Honduras and Belize, but see we can't because Kamala Harris has brown skin so she's a god.
[01:22:34.443 --> 01:22:42.466]  So she can engage in racial baiting and try to demonize America's existence and the American flag and all the rest of the Democrats hate.
[01:22:42.746 --> 01:22:43.326]  So here she is.
[01:22:44.537 --> 01:22:55.120]  Are you aware of the perception of many about how the power and the discretion at ICE is being used to enforce the laws?
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.660]  And do you see any parallels?
[01:22:58.121 --> 01:23:01.021]  I do not see any parallels between... I'm talking about perception.
[01:23:01.041 --> 01:23:02.862]  Officers and agents... I'm talking about perception.
[01:23:03.753 --> 01:23:08.918]  I do not see a parallel between what is constitutionally mandated as it relates to enforcing the law.
[01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:15.685]  Are you aware that there's a perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK?
[01:23:16.245 --> 01:23:17.106]  Is that what you're asking me?
[01:23:17.727 --> 01:23:19.548]  No, I'm very specific about what I'm asking.
[01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:26.095]  Are you aware of a perception that the way that the discretion... I see no parallel.
[01:23:26.115 --> 01:23:26.695]  I'm not finished.
[01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:27.236]  I see none.
[01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:28.116]  I'm not finished.
[01:23:28.777 --> 01:23:29.398]  I'm not finished.
[01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:49.293]  Are you aware that there's a perception that ICE is administering its power in a way that is causing fear and intimidation, particularly among immigrants, and specifically among immigrants coming from Mexico and Central America?
[01:23:49.533 --> 01:23:50.894]  Are you aware of that perception?
[01:23:52.189 --> 01:24:02.035]  I do not see a parallel between the power and the authority that ICE has to do its job and the agents and officers who do it professionally and excellently with lots of compassion.
[01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:09.019]  Sir, how can you be the head of an agency and be unaware of how your agency is perceived by certain communities?
[01:24:09.059 --> 01:24:13.562]  There is a lot of perceptions in the media and in the public that are incorrect about the agency.
[01:24:13.582 --> 01:24:15.623]  But the perception exists, would you agree?
[01:24:16.924 --> 01:24:18.105]  Whether or not it's correct.
[01:24:18.545 --> 01:24:21.147]  And wouldn't you agree then that if that perception exists,
[01:24:22.156 --> 01:24:25.977]  There might need to be some work done to correct the perception.
[01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:30.058]  We're going to back that up and play it again in a moment.
[01:24:30.138 --> 01:24:31.759]  The computer jumped ahead like 10 seconds.
[01:24:31.819 --> 01:24:35.140]  She says the perception that you're KKK and then he responds to it.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.020]  That part, for some reason, wasn't there.
[01:24:39.921 --> 01:24:41.862]  This is a race-baiting KKK member.
[01:24:42.762 --> 01:24:49.024]  This is a racist, Hispanic woman who has a chip on her shoulder against America and white people and she's there
[01:24:50.097 --> 01:24:59.672]  Saying that people trying to get into the country to have anchor babies and get everything free are so scared of the KKK that they're fighting to get into it.
[01:24:59.692 --> 01:25:05.620]  And then they get there and half the agents on average are Hispanic and literally treat them like royalty.
[01:25:06.854 --> 01:25:17.019]  And then if a person shows up with a bunch of unidentified kids, they take the kids away from them until they find out who they are, and this same woman claims they're brutalizing kids, and has compared it to the Nazis.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.301]  This is a monster, race-baiting pig!
[01:25:21.442 --> 01:25:22.122]  That's what she is.
[01:25:23.323 --> 01:25:26.545]  And this is how these people operate.
[01:25:27.985 --> 01:25:29.066]  The full quotes are online.
[01:25:32.435 --> 01:25:36.718]  So let's go ahead and play it from the beginning so you can have it here in context.
[01:25:38.279 --> 01:25:51.508]  I think you would agree as a member of law enforcement that law enforcement, generally speaking, and certainly would be the case with ICE officers and agents, that a great deal of your power is discretionary.
[01:25:52.574 --> 01:26:02.639]  You have limited resources and you make decisions about what you're going to do, but you exercise a great deal of discretion in terms of how you're going to use the limited resources and how you're going to prioritize them.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:15.606]  And then understanding that, I think you would also agree that one's perspective and their bias, if they have bias, will influence their exercise of discretion.
[01:26:16.306 --> 01:26:19.207]  In terms of the power they have and how it will be used and implemented.
[01:26:19.647 --> 01:26:22.808]  So I want to return to the question that Senator Peters asked you.
[01:26:23.728 --> 01:26:29.669]  About the statement you made describing the Democratic Party as liberal-cratic or neo-clannist.
[01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:37.531]  Which was, I think the assumption there was that you were comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:26:38.492 --> 01:26:39.132]  The KKK.
[01:26:40.052 --> 01:26:42.853]  So, you said in response to his question,
[01:26:44.144 --> 01:26:46.426]  You're sorry because the words caused offense.
[01:26:47.607 --> 01:26:51.350]  So, would you not be sorry if no one was offended by your words?
[01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:53.292]  No, it was wrong to do.
[01:26:53.312 --> 01:26:54.513]  Why was it wrong?
[01:26:55.353 --> 01:26:56.434]  Because those are offensive words.
[01:26:57.115 --> 01:26:58.016]  Why are they offensive?
[01:26:58.749 --> 01:27:04.231]  Because they have history in this country and I honestly did not mean it that way.
[01:27:04.571 --> 01:27:06.292]  But please talk about the history.
[01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:20.658]  Here's a woman in the party that founded the KKK that is a total race-baiting party of crime and Blue City sludge and needles and feces and child trafficking and radical Islam supporting and just all the filth.
[01:27:21.598 --> 01:27:22.918]  That would then make those words wrong.
[01:27:48.954 --> 01:27:53.436]  Well, the Klan was what we would call today a domestic terrorist group.
[01:27:53.916 --> 01:27:54.197]  Why?
[01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:57.578]  Why would we call them domestic terrorists?
[01:27:57.598 --> 01:27:58.839]  Because they're race-based scum like you.
[01:27:58.859 --> 01:28:02.580]  Because they tried to use fear and force to change political environments.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.221]  Like anti-Semite Democrats?
[01:28:03.241 --> 01:28:04.021]  It was based on race and ethnicity.
[01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:04.241]  Right.
[01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:19.568]  Are you aware of the perception of many about how the power and the discretion at ICE is being used to enforce the laws?
[01:28:20.748 --> 01:28:22.109]  And do you see any parallels?
[01:28:22.569 --> 01:28:26.290]  I do not see any parallels between... I'm talking about perception.
[01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:32.692]  So there she goes doing the parallel with that flipping it around that we're not the KKK here at the Democratic Party race-based system.
[01:28:33.072 --> 01:28:33.672]  No, no, no.
[01:28:34.132 --> 01:28:36.273]  It's you and you can't have a border or a country.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:40.780]  All right, you rolling?
[01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:44.021]  What am I going to say?
[01:28:46.681 --> 01:29:00.924]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[01:29:01.725 --> 01:29:03.605]  That it was basic American free market liberty
[01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:07.151]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[01:29:07.671 --> 01:29:17.576]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of
[01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.091]  Evil regime.
[01:29:21.591 --> 01:29:22.572]  Radical Islam.
[01:29:22.852 --> 01:29:23.953]  The Communist Chinese.
[01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:27.435]  The evil Juncker of the EU.
[01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:28.776]  It's just crazy.
[01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.818]  Of course we can beat these people.
[01:29:31.218 --> 01:29:32.799]  Of course they can be stopped.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.282]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[01:29:36.742 --> 01:29:39.685]  I always wondered 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[01:29:40.205 --> 01:29:42.326]  Then about 25 years ago, I got politically involved.
[01:29:43.286 --> 01:29:45.027]  23 years ago, I got on air, and then I learned why.
[01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:46.648]  Because you get fired.
[01:29:47.168 --> 01:29:48.449]  Because you get demonized.
[01:29:48.469 --> 01:29:49.509]  Because you get sued.
[01:29:49.529 --> 01:29:51.190]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[01:29:52.591 --> 01:29:54.532]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[01:29:55.092 --> 01:29:57.433]  And so you'll never stick your head up, because you don't want that to happen.
[01:29:58.294 --> 01:30:03.956]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[01:30:03.976 --> 01:30:07.258]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[01:30:08.592 --> 01:30:10.593]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[01:30:10.733 --> 01:30:13.275]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[01:30:13.355 --> 01:30:18.619]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[01:30:19.419 --> 01:30:22.161]  And that's why I know we're going to win.
[01:30:22.301 --> 01:30:29.366]  Because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty, I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[01:30:30.026 --> 01:30:31.567]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[01:30:32.147 --> 01:30:36.630]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:41.492]  We're going to send a million letters at WriteTrump.com.
[01:30:41.552 --> 01:30:43.013]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[01:30:43.854 --> 01:30:45.215]  That way, two letters go per person.
[01:30:45.255 --> 01:30:48.997]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[01:30:49.057 --> 01:30:52.459]  I want to send about 80% of whatever we get in.
[01:30:52.479 --> 01:30:53.819]  I hope it will be a million.
[01:30:53.839 --> 01:30:54.300]  That's up to you.
[01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:56.229]  To the White House.
[01:30:56.269 --> 01:30:57.731]  Another 100,000 in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:30:58.031 --> 01:30:59.272]  Another 100,000 in Trump Tower.
[01:30:59.532 --> 01:31:02.594]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these.
[01:31:02.674 --> 01:31:04.555]  And he pays attention to a letter.
[01:31:04.996 --> 01:31:06.277]  He sees that as like 10,000 emails.
[01:31:07.417 --> 01:31:08.318]  That you took action.
[01:31:08.358 --> 01:31:09.179]  That you got involved.
[01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:15.903]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[01:31:15.923 --> 01:31:16.304]  So again,
[01:31:17.623 --> 01:31:18.644]  RightTrump.com.
[01:31:18.664 --> 01:31:21.227]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the President.
[01:31:21.287 --> 01:31:23.369]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[01:31:23.849 --> 01:31:25.411]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[01:31:25.491 --> 01:31:26.692]  We're going to send it regardless.
[01:31:27.032 --> 01:31:27.613]  It's so easy.
[01:31:27.653 --> 01:31:28.674]  Go spend two minutes.
[01:31:29.154 --> 01:31:29.895]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[01:31:31.278 --> 01:31:32.239]  Sign up and send a letter.
[01:31:32.459 --> 01:31:33.780]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.663]  Hopefully you add something to it so that there'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[01:31:40.103 --> 01:31:42.084]  And regardless, it gets the globalist attention.
[01:31:42.365 --> 01:31:43.205]  So we're not laying down.
[01:31:43.245 --> 01:31:46.347]  We're not just curling up in a ball in a fetal position and taking all this crap.
[01:31:46.707 --> 01:31:49.369]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against Big Tech.
[01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:52.831]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[01:31:53.311 --> 01:31:59.275]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:02.581]  I'm gonna found an organization very soon as well.
[01:32:02.861 --> 01:32:05.707]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[01:32:05.727 --> 01:32:10.637]  But this is phase one to show the president we're sending him a million real letters.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.241]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:13.581 --> 01:32:18.404]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at righttrump.com.
[01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:32.731]  So go there yourself, text message, email your friends, neighbors, family, and tell them, get involved and stand up to Apple, stand up to Google, stand up to Facebook, stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying, America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[01:32:33.272 --> 01:32:33.952]  God bless you all.
[01:32:41.059 --> 01:32:45.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:58.409 --> 01:33:00.130]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:03.492]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:04.092 --> 01:33:05.233]  Alright!
[01:33:12.575 --> 01:33:13.295]  Next segment.
[01:33:13.595 --> 01:33:14.316]  I'm a little bit behind.
[01:33:15.776 --> 01:33:27.380]  I'm gonna get into an incredible window into the world of total big tech surveillance and what they can do once the Internet ID is in place.
[01:33:29.281 --> 01:33:30.741]  Chicago has already done it.
[01:33:31.201 --> 01:33:32.202]  Venezuela's doing it.
[01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:34.402]  Blue cities are all going to do it.
[01:33:37.243 --> 01:33:41.785]  Amusement tax forced on PlayStation gamers in Chicago.
[01:33:43.615 --> 01:33:44.175]  I'm not kidding.
[01:33:46.137 --> 01:33:48.458]  We're going to be getting to that coming up, and it ties into Reuters.
[01:33:49.219 --> 01:33:52.741]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens.
[01:33:52.801 --> 01:33:54.722]  It's the world social scorb.
[01:33:56.944 --> 01:33:58.084]  Get ready for it.
[01:33:59.045 --> 01:34:00.606]  It's going to be nightmarish.
[01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:04.269]  But people won't stand up for themselves, and so it's going to get bad.
[01:34:04.289 --> 01:34:10.493]  Especially because lawmakers on average are like 75 years old and don't know how to find their ass with both hands.
[01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:12.354]  And I'm not saying they're 75 years old.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.722]  They're all a bunch of arrogant lawyers that care more about playing golf than having people pull their chairs out for them.
[01:34:19.502 --> 01:34:20.522]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:34:20.562 --> 01:34:24.263]  The Chi-Coms and Big Tech are running circles around them.
[01:34:24.423 --> 01:34:25.023]  It's sick.
[01:34:27.164 --> 01:34:34.506]  So, we just played a bunch of Camilla Harris, the Democrat kook, the racist race baiter, the KKK lover.
[01:34:35.147 --> 01:34:36.207]  She's in the KKK party.
[01:34:36.887 --> 01:34:39.108]  Draws parallels between ICE and the KKK.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:45.110]  Now let's talk Turkey.
[01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:54.214]  You've got 800 million people in Latin America and the population is set to double in the next 20 years to 1.6 billion.
[01:34:55.775 --> 01:35:04.238]  That 1.8 billion Muslims, they're set to double by 2030 in the next 12 years or 11 years.
[01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:05.158]  Time's flying.
[01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:09.720]  And these are mono-cultures in the Middle East.
[01:35:11.044 --> 01:35:12.545]  Monocultures in North Africa.
[01:35:13.065 --> 01:35:15.285]  Monocultures in Islamic countries in Asia.
[01:35:16.786 --> 01:35:19.067]  Because they don't live in peace with you if you're not a Muslim.
[01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:22.588]  In fact, if you're not the right type of Muslim, you dead!
[01:35:23.748 --> 01:35:32.731]  But the left, oh Zuckerberg's considering banning Trump off Facebook because he banned people from six nations that don't have real passports.
[01:35:34.732 --> 01:35:34.892]  So,
[01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:50.166]  The great crime is stopping the UN and these big corporations that have already looted the third world from stopping the political groups they organize and that have come to your border to get all the free goods and bankrupt your welfare society.
[01:35:51.807 --> 01:36:01.769]  There is hope, though, because in Germany and in Sweden and in Italy, the socialists, in many cases, have been joining
[01:36:02.975 --> 01:36:08.718]  The right-wingers are going, yeah, we don't want our pension funds totally bankrupted.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:12.500]  And so we better stop.
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:19.764]  But see, the globalists are now banning the socialists off Facebook and Twitter and YouTube because they're not little socialist globalists.
[01:36:21.505 --> 01:36:29.450]  But China is now moving into Venezuela to control the invasion of Central and North America and to put in a national ID control grid.
[01:36:31.297 --> 01:36:36.186]  And Google's actually helping the Venezuelan dictatorship suppress their population.
[01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:40.333]  We're going to cover all that in the next segment.
[01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:42.918]  But let's get to this because...
[01:36:44.022 --> 01:36:51.565]  There's not just saying the caravan invasions don't exist, or the UN's not involved, or Soros isn't involved, when it's all public knowledge that's going on.
[01:36:51.885 --> 01:37:03.269]  Soros is separately in Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and Reuters bragging that he's funding the migrant caravans through money he gets from taxpayers via the State Department and the UN.
[01:37:04.636 --> 01:37:11.078]  So they'll have a PR piece in the same New York Times about how great it is that they're funding the migrants, and then another piece saying it doesn't exist.
[01:37:11.098 --> 01:37:12.079]  You're like, well that doesn't make sense.
[01:37:12.419 --> 01:37:15.340]  No, they're training you to accept lies!
[01:37:19.961 --> 01:37:24.783]  And then you have an article, National Guard soldier arrested charged with smuggling Mexican nationals into the U.S.
[01:37:25.463 --> 01:37:28.424]  A migration-related news coverage continues to center around U.S.
[01:37:28.464 --> 01:37:29.405]  troops deployed to the U.S.
[01:37:29.425 --> 01:37:29.665]  border.
[01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:33.270]  Anticipation of migrant caravans along the way to arrival.
[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:38.374]  One service member has reportedly gone against the security grain and smuggled Mexican migrants into the U.S.
[01:37:38.454 --> 01:37:42.638]  Oh, he's gone against the security grain, says the Army Times.
[01:37:42.678 --> 01:37:43.639]  The security grain.
[01:37:43.999 --> 01:37:45.160]  He's violated his orders.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.441]  He's violated his oath.
[01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:51.465]  He's violated federal law with human smuggling and aided and abetted the smuggler groups that brought him up here.
[01:37:51.906 --> 01:37:53.888]  But that's just going against the grain.
[01:37:53.908 --> 01:37:55.849]  Kind of like the U.N.
[01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:56.550]  says NAMBLA.
[01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:58.872]  Want to date your five-year-old daughter is going against the grain.
[01:38:00.336 --> 01:38:09.859]  California National Guardsman, PFC Edward Acosta-Avalob, was arrested November 10th with his car.
[01:38:09.919 --> 01:38:15.500]  It was stopped near San Diego, California, about two miles north of the US-Mexico border, USA reported.
[01:38:15.701 --> 01:38:16.761]  But this is all just now.
[01:38:18.038 --> 01:38:18.698]  We're good to go.
[01:38:34.172 --> 01:38:36.753]  It smashed over the Mexican border two and a half weeks ago.
[01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:37.913]  It was tens of thousands.
[01:38:38.294 --> 01:38:42.555]  Now, dozens from Caravan line up at border, seek asylum, New York Times.
[01:38:42.995 --> 01:38:45.396]  Local news says it's 2,000, according to Border Patrol.
[01:38:45.757 --> 01:38:47.397]  See, dozens means 2,000.
[01:38:47.737 --> 01:38:48.358]  Hundreds means 50,000.
[01:38:48.618 --> 01:38:52.099]  You have to learn how the math works.
[01:38:52.539 --> 01:38:53.439]  Learn how the doublespeak works.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.560]  It's a formula of deception.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.321]  Now, here's another example of a deception.
[01:38:58.301 --> 01:38:58.782]  It's everywhere.
[01:38:59.282 --> 01:39:02.203]  This is out of five news online.
[01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.151]  K-F-S-P.
[01:39:05.112 --> 01:39:09.794]  Springdale man arrested after shooting at multiple officers during pursuit.
[01:39:13.016 --> 01:39:16.297]  So again, Springdale man arrested for shooting at multiple officers during pursuit.
[01:39:18.438 --> 01:39:30.824]  Video captured by Bystander shows the moments when a gunman opened fire on a Washington County deputy who tried to stop him near... It goes on from that point.
[01:39:37.062 --> 01:39:43.387]  So this is Springdale, Arkansas, and he's shooting at the vehicle for them pulling him over.
[01:39:43.407 --> 01:39:44.948]  He's an illegal alien.
[01:39:45.808 --> 01:39:49.071]  He's been deported before, but you've got to dig deep to even learn that.
[01:39:49.911 --> 01:39:50.792]  That's really the headline here.
[01:39:51.512 --> 01:39:55.896]  MSM Nationwide covers and just says, a Springdale man.
[01:39:55.916 --> 01:39:58.437]  It's like when Muslims rape little girls or kill them.
[01:39:58.678 --> 01:40:05.903]  It's always German men, ten German men, kidnapped a four-year-old girl and raped her for days before hanging her.
[01:40:07.065 --> 01:40:09.026]  No, it was a group of Islamists.
[01:40:09.066 --> 01:40:14.770]  And it's the same story.
[01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:17.151]  Never tell you it's an illegal alien.
[01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:20.153]  Never tell you that he gets pulled over.
[01:40:20.654 --> 01:40:23.115]  This is just what he does, you know, in Mexico.
[01:40:24.396 --> 01:40:25.316]  But see him at fullwars.com.
[01:40:28.871 --> 01:40:29.431]  We'll tell you.
[01:40:30.192 --> 01:40:35.776]  Dashcam video shows moment illegal immigrant suspect opens fire on Arkansas police officer.
[01:40:36.236 --> 01:40:37.597]  Fox News is reporting as well.
[01:40:37.917 --> 01:40:47.764]  Newly released dashcam video shows the moments a police officer in Arkansas stared down the barrel of gun during an intense shootout with an illegal immigrant suspect over the weekend.
[01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:54.849]  The driver, 29-year-old Luis Cabos Sinaboy.
[01:40:55.069 --> 01:40:55.710]  How do you say that?
[01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:57.231]  Sinaboy?
[01:40:59.392 --> 01:41:05.994]  C-E-N-O-B-I-O didn't stop and the officer reportedly initiated a brief chase.
[01:41:06.114 --> 01:41:12.036]  After eventually pulling over, he got out of his vehicle and began shooting at Thompson, officials say.
[01:41:14.476 --> 01:41:16.377]  He riddled the police car with bullet holes.
[01:41:16.877 --> 01:41:20.218]  Thompson quickly returned fire and he fled the scene.
[01:41:24.099 --> 01:41:30.545]  The 29-year-old was found by another officer about a half an hour later, and once again, shot at police, officials said.
[01:41:30.825 --> 01:41:36.991]  He was then followed into Fayetteville, where Fayetteville Police and Arkansas State Police joined the pursuit until he was eventually stopped and taken into custody.
[01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:41.415]  If he gets a leftist jury, he'll be let go, like the guy that shot the young lady in the back.
[01:41:41.636 --> 01:41:42.416]  They said, you're allowed to.
[01:41:42.436 --> 01:41:42.837]  Just kill her.
[01:41:43.117 --> 01:41:43.557]  She's white.
[01:41:43.678 --> 01:41:43.898]  Do it.
[01:41:45.083 --> 01:41:45.623]  San Francisco.
[01:41:46.044 --> 01:41:53.970]  Authorities say the 29-year-old had a wound to the left arm and shoulder and was taken into hospital before being handed over to police.
[01:41:55.451 --> 01:42:11.284]  Luis Cabos Bububabo, or Pupu Nubu, however you say it, has been charged with four counts of attempted capital murder, committing a terroristic act, fleeing possession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia.
[01:42:11.504 --> 01:42:14.046]  You have him open and shut, shooting at the police for no reason.
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:16.861]  We don't need a bunch of appeals.
[01:42:17.281 --> 01:42:20.663]  He gets his appeals, and then he gets lethal injection.
[01:42:20.743 --> 01:42:22.444]  Kill this animal dog.
[01:42:23.165 --> 01:42:24.385]  Kill these people.
[01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.647]  I don't care if they're white, black, or Hispanic.
[01:42:27.087 --> 01:42:35.092]  If you're running around for no reason trying to kill people, because they pull you over when you're speeding, then we need to just put these mad dogs down.
[01:42:37.699 --> 01:42:40.906]  There's only three days left for the mega sales.
[01:42:41.227 --> 01:42:43.752]  67% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:43.872 --> 01:42:45.917]  And don't forget, free shipping storewide.
[01:42:46.238 --> 01:42:47.500]  All in, in just three days.
[01:42:53.999 --> 01:42:58.581]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[01:42:58.621 --> 01:43:15.790]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.911]  But is it true?
[01:43:17.811 --> 01:43:24.297]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[01:43:25.298 --> 01:43:28.841]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[01:43:29.821 --> 01:43:31.223]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[01:43:32.156 --> 01:43:37.858]  So the establishment wants us off the air because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[01:43:38.218 --> 01:43:40.318]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[01:43:40.658 --> 01:43:41.119]  to 3 p.m.
[01:43:41.179 --> 01:43:41.999]  just on my show.
[01:43:42.359 --> 01:43:44.780]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:45.140]  Central.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:49.041]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:43:49.061 --> 01:43:49.661]  in the War Room.
[01:43:49.881 --> 01:43:51.882]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[01:43:51.902 --> 01:43:53.102]  They're trying to block that.
[01:43:54.008 --> 01:43:57.791]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported Infowars.
[01:43:58.471 --> 01:44:05.496]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[01:44:06.096 --> 01:44:08.618]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[01:44:09.398 --> 01:44:13.440]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:15.061]  Kick us off PayPal.
[01:44:15.081 --> 01:44:15.962]  Kick us off Facebook.
[01:44:16.042 --> 01:44:16.842]  Kick us off Twitter.
[01:44:16.862 --> 01:44:17.663]  Kick us off YouTube.
[01:44:17.723 --> 01:44:24.287]  And over a hundred other platforms now where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[01:44:24.887 --> 01:44:32.911]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[01:44:32.971 --> 01:44:35.012]  That's because we are on target.
[01:44:35.072 --> 01:44:37.214]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[01:44:37.254 --> 01:44:39.155]  We're exposing their main operation.
[01:44:39.615 --> 01:44:41.276]  And look, I know you guys know that.
[01:44:41.696 --> 01:44:42.857]  That's why you've supported us quickly.
[01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:48.680]  So many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:44:49.941 --> 01:44:51.864]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[01:44:51.884 --> 01:45:05.184]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever, to hand-share those links, to text message people.
[01:45:05.544 --> 01:45:08.965]  Information you think is particularly important, to get around the censors.
[01:45:09.025 --> 01:45:10.386]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[01:45:10.866 --> 01:45:14.427]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[01:45:14.647 --> 01:45:17.028]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[01:45:17.528 --> 01:45:26.231]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[01:45:26.251 --> 01:45:31.613]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, they're all there at infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:31.653 --> 01:45:33.394]  Patriot apparel, it's all there.
[01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:47.149]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:47.269 --> 01:45:59.796]  And we already had a huge mega-sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[01:46:00.817 --> 01:46:03.758]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[01:46:04.158 --> 01:46:08.559]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you the specials.
[01:46:08.579 --> 01:46:15.421]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:15.821 --> 01:46:17.181]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[01:46:17.201 --> 01:46:18.642]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[01:46:19.062 --> 01:46:19.402]  30% off.
[01:46:19.622 --> 01:46:21.222]  Everybody really loves Mercurial Oil Silver.
[01:46:21.402 --> 01:46:22.503]  Highest quality, 67% off.
[01:46:22.523 --> 01:46:23.063]  Silver Bullet.
[01:46:24.563 --> 01:46:30.269]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:30.809 --> 01:46:36.995]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[01:46:40.979 --> 01:46:43.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:56.331 --> 01:47:01.313]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:01.373 --> 01:47:01.933]  Shots fired!
[01:47:02.034 --> 01:47:03.114]  Shots fired!
[01:47:03.194 --> 01:47:03.694]  Jesus!
[01:47:04.395 --> 01:47:07.876]  Shots fired, Kenny.
[01:47:55.051 --> 01:48:02.053]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you can't see this incredible footage, but it's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:48:03.514 --> 01:48:08.175]  But let's just say that this illegal alien does not have the highest IQ.
[01:48:09.736 --> 01:48:10.896]  How do you pronounce his last name?
[01:48:10.916 --> 01:48:12.196]  I don't have the highest IQ either.
[01:48:12.216 --> 01:48:19.879]  29-year-old Luis Cabos Shinabayo Sonobio
[01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:26.812]  So this idiot, 29-year-old Luis Cabos Sinabio, is an illegal alien here.
[01:48:27.732 --> 01:48:40.978]  He's in Arkansas, and the police try to pull him over, so he just gets out of the car and starts trying to kill the police, and then tries to come around into the police car to kill the cop.
[01:48:41.598 --> 01:48:44.460]  Really smart, if you're wanting to get the death penalty.
[01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.991]  For no reason.
[01:48:46.771 --> 01:48:48.673]  All he would have gotten was maybe deported.
[01:48:49.173 --> 01:48:54.778]  Most of the police departments, nothing, because the judges are globalists and leftists in Sanctuary City, and say let him go.
[01:48:54.858 --> 01:49:04.487]  But instead, he tries to kill this cop, races on down the road, other police see him, and he stops and tries to kill them!
[01:49:06.308 --> 01:49:11.073]  Now, normally when illegal aliens kill people in blue cities, they are actually let off.
[01:49:11.193 --> 01:49:12.294]  Every few days I see where
[01:49:13.444 --> 01:49:15.465]  Hit and run, stabbing, shooting.
[01:49:15.565 --> 01:49:17.646]  Shoot a young woman in the back in San Francisco.
[01:49:18.206 --> 01:49:18.986]  They let him go.
[01:49:19.106 --> 01:49:19.767]  No charges.
[01:49:20.307 --> 01:49:27.350]  They said, in fact, there's talk of suits against the state and against the feds for even supporting it.
[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:29.391]  That's right.
[01:49:29.711 --> 01:49:30.951]  She shot a woman in the back.
[01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:31.592]  She's white.
[01:49:32.112 --> 01:49:32.832]  Kill her ass.
[01:49:33.572 --> 01:49:34.853]  And that was a white jury.
[01:49:36.735 --> 01:49:38.076]  That's white prosecutors.
[01:49:38.536 --> 01:49:52.966]  Because there's nothing like a virtue signal saying, you want to take a gun and shoot a woman in the back, as long as they're white, as long as it's in San Francisco, the city of piles of human feces, it's a good thing.
[01:49:54.627 --> 01:49:55.768]  Because this is the cult.
[01:49:55.848 --> 01:49:58.970]  You cannot say any illegal alien is bad, unless they're white.
[01:49:59.410 --> 01:50:03.713]  And they had that German illegal alien running around burning everything down in Colorado for a couple years.
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:09.204]  There's a lot of crazy people fleeing their countries that get here illegally and then they have no identity.
[01:50:09.244 --> 01:50:10.645]  They can do pretty much anything they want.
[01:50:10.665 --> 01:50:14.108]  Remember the railway killer that they confirm he killed 20 plus people?
[01:50:14.349 --> 01:50:15.089]  Mainly Hispanics.
[01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.730]  He was Hispanic.
[01:50:16.851 --> 01:50:22.716]  He just rode around on trains murdering people and no one could ever catch him because he didn't have any identity.
[01:50:22.957 --> 01:50:27.481]  But then everybody else has got to be surveilled 24 hours by the system or we're terrorists.
[01:50:28.735 --> 01:50:40.022]  So dash cam video shows moment illegal immigrant, illegal alien, suspect opens fire on Arkansas police officer and then gets chased down the road and shoots at more police vehicles until he gets shot twice.
[01:50:41.883 --> 01:50:46.406]  And now he's out of any type of condition and is at the jail.
[01:50:47.346 --> 01:50:50.568]  And I'm sure the left will be saying release him immediately.
[01:50:50.608 --> 01:50:51.949]  The article is on Infowars.com.
[01:50:52.309 --> 01:50:55.931]  Watch illegal alien charged with attempted murder after firing at the police.
[01:50:55.971 --> 01:50:57.112]  Let me tell you, he didn't just shoot at him.
[01:50:59.463 --> 01:51:01.324]  He was coming up to the vehicle.
[01:51:02.505 --> 01:51:07.047]  He wasn't risking his life to like fight ISIS that has sex slaves or Al-Qaeda or something.
[01:51:07.067 --> 01:51:09.168]  He wasn't risking his life to fight another military.
[01:51:09.569 --> 01:51:13.291]  He was going out of his way because the cops dared pull him over to try to kill a cop.
[01:51:14.271 --> 01:51:14.912]  On dash cam!
[01:51:18.033 --> 01:51:20.395]  This guy is a real rocket scientist.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:27.205]  He's risking his life for no reason to try to kill a cop because he hates America and police so much.
[01:51:27.506 --> 01:51:28.326]  That's the mindset.
[01:51:28.346 --> 01:51:29.607]  To him, this is evil.
[01:51:30.008 --> 01:51:30.648]  This is bad.
[01:51:30.708 --> 01:51:33.591]  You've seen the different confessions.
[01:51:33.631 --> 01:51:36.133]  Can we pull the guy up that Trump ran ads of that got banned?
[01:51:36.534 --> 01:51:38.976]  Illegal alien, deported repeatedly.
[01:51:39.296 --> 01:51:41.958]  You have anything to say after you killed this cop in cold blood and shot him in the back?
[01:51:42.439 --> 01:51:44.521]  No, I'm just sad I didn't kill more.
[01:51:45.643 --> 01:51:53.985]  Because there's a certain percentage of people in Latin America who've ruined those countries who are into the cult of death and murdering people indiscriminately.
[01:51:55.945 --> 01:52:00.186]  And illegal aliens on average commit twice as much crime as any other group.
[01:52:01.546 --> 01:52:03.186]  Does that mean all the quote immigrants are bad people?
[01:52:03.566 --> 01:52:03.766]  No!
[01:52:04.206 --> 01:52:08.127]  But statistically there are a lot of criminals coming in and that's what Trump said.
[01:52:09.607 --> 01:52:12.768]  And they mainly feed on their own communities.
[01:52:14.346 --> 01:52:16.187]  But we're told it doesn't matter.
[01:52:16.507 --> 01:52:17.567]  Were we able to find that piece?
[01:52:17.587 --> 01:52:19.007]  I forget the name of the band video.
[01:52:19.448 --> 01:52:27.950]  This is the band ad just a few weeks ago in the whole election that's got the guy saying he's just too bad he didn't kill more cops.
[01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:29.111]  It's incredible.
[01:52:30.311 --> 01:52:31.291]  But that's the mindset here.
[01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:39.194]  What I do want to get to since I mentioned San Francisco is this piece I mentioned a few days ago but I didn't get to because NBC
[01:52:40.743 --> 01:52:51.089]  Actually did a good job telling the truth about the disgusting crime-ridden situation in San Francisco Bay Area and and why are blue cities such hell pits?
[01:52:51.129 --> 01:52:57.052]  So we're going to play that report then we did find the other piece but here is this extremely powerful NBC report.
[01:52:59.209 --> 01:53:05.974]  The investigation reveals a dangerous concoction of drug needles, garbage, and even feces lining the streets of downtown.
[01:53:06.134 --> 01:53:13.719]  Investigative reporter Begad Shaban explains why parts of the city are now being compared to some of the worst slums, not just in the country, but in the world.
[01:53:16.363 --> 01:53:18.923]  Terry and Jess, parts of the city aren't just disgusting.
[01:53:18.983 --> 01:53:21.464]  These diseased streets can be dangerous.
[01:53:22.004 --> 01:53:24.264]  Millions of your tax dollars are spent cleaning them.
[01:53:24.444 --> 01:53:29.145]  So why does one of the richest cities in the world have neighborhoods that resemble some of the poorest?
[01:53:29.705 --> 01:53:31.106]  Tonight, we investigate.
[01:53:33.626 --> 01:53:34.386]  You like taking walks?
[01:53:34.526 --> 01:53:36.527]  With my mom and my dad.
[01:53:36.967 --> 01:53:39.807]  Anila Reed is pretty observant for a three-year-old.
[01:53:40.367 --> 01:53:42.168]  This looks like a microphone.
[01:53:42.208 --> 01:53:42.848]  That's what it is.
[01:53:43.148 --> 01:53:43.968]  And rambunctious.
[01:53:47.242 --> 01:53:51.364]  Which might be why she had no problem telling us her thoughts on San Francisco.
[01:53:51.384 --> 01:53:53.666]  You know, someone pooped in there.
[01:53:53.706 --> 01:53:54.826]  You've seen poop sometimes?
[01:53:54.846 --> 01:53:55.607]  Yeah, in garbage.
[01:53:55.667 --> 01:53:58.528]  How does that make you feel?
[01:53:58.548 --> 01:53:59.829]  That makes me angry.
[01:53:59.929 --> 01:54:00.910]  It makes you angry?
[01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.930]  Yeah!
[01:54:02.351 --> 01:54:08.254]  Anila and her fellow preschoolers have to regularly dodge some of the worst of what San Francisco has to offer.
[01:54:08.534 --> 01:54:15.018]  The day we met Anila, she and her class walked right by nearly a dozen drug needles.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.560]  That's the kids singing, by the way.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:21.141]  You've got to start paying attention to the ground, okay?
[01:54:21.261 --> 01:54:21.721]  Okay.
[01:54:21.941 --> 01:54:25.082]  Kim Davenport is Anila's mom and often walks her to school.
[01:54:25.322 --> 01:54:27.003]  It's not safe, it's not healthy.
[01:54:27.103 --> 01:54:29.583]  Feces on the ground, needles.
[01:54:29.803 --> 01:54:32.684]  You've actually had to pull her out of the way to keep her separate.
[01:54:32.704 --> 01:54:33.664]  Yes, of course.
[01:54:33.764 --> 01:54:35.165]  I just had to do that this morning.
[01:54:35.865 --> 01:54:37.447]  So how dirty is the city?
[01:54:38.047 --> 01:54:40.209]  I hit the streets with my producer to find out.
[01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:44.853]  Together, we surveyed 153 blocks of downtown San Francisco.
[01:54:45.354 --> 01:54:50.899]  We spent three days walking up and down every street, inspecting more than 20 miles of the city.
[01:54:51.539 --> 01:54:54.321]  We found trash on every block.
[01:54:54.862 --> 01:54:57.784]  303 piles of feces and 100 needles.
[01:54:58.365 --> 01:55:08.593]  If you do get stuck with these disposed needles, you can get HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B. Dr. Lee Riley is an infectious disease expert at UC Berkeley.
[01:55:08.774 --> 01:55:11.856]  The fecal matter could possibly get into air.
[01:55:12.196 --> 01:55:15.699]  And if you happen to inhale that, it can also go into your intestine.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:18.382]  Which can be deadly, especially for children.
[01:55:18.982 --> 01:55:27.393]  Dr. Riley has researched some of the dirtiest slums in the world, but believes contamination levels in parts of San Francisco may now be even worse.
[01:55:27.793 --> 01:55:34.682]  Much higher than what we see in places like Brazil or Kenya or India.
[01:55:35.923 --> 01:55:43.546]  The neighborhoods we surveyed include the notorious Tenderloin, but also popular tourist spots like Union Square and major hotels.
[01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:48.688]  The area also includes City Hall, schools, playgrounds, and a police station.
[01:55:49.188 --> 01:55:51.369]  We took hundreds of photos and videos.
[01:55:51.569 --> 01:55:52.509]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:55:52.569 --> 01:55:53.009]  That's enough.
[01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:54.910]  It goes on for four more minutes.
[01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:56.971]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:59.892 --> 01:56:02.853]  But you have to understand, Democrats ship the drugs in.
[01:56:03.313 --> 01:56:06.894]  Democrats ship the human trafficking in.
[01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:08.914]  Democrats manage it.
[01:56:09.854 --> 01:56:15.576]  But you think this army, PFC, that got caught bringing illegal aliens in yesterday?
[01:56:16.856 --> 01:56:18.076]  You think this is the only person doing this?
[01:56:18.176 --> 01:56:19.217]  It's big business.
[01:56:19.477 --> 01:56:25.218]  Because once they get here, they get the free welfare, the free housing, the babies are had for free.
[01:56:26.752 --> 01:56:27.633]  They're made citizens.
[01:56:28.293 --> 01:56:33.736]  And then the Democrats and the local mafia, they go get them a job, and they take most of their welfare money.
[01:56:36.298 --> 01:56:45.324]  And then, if they get uppity, then there's a call made to ICE from the sanctuary city, and they say that you've done something illegal, and then ICE is allowed to come in.
[01:56:46.965 --> 01:56:49.166]  So they bring in these people as their slaves.
[01:56:49.706 --> 01:56:50.407]  It's on record.
[01:56:50.907 --> 01:56:51.768]  That's how this works.
[01:56:53.103 --> 01:56:54.145]  And that's why it's getting worse.
[01:56:54.606 --> 01:56:58.732]  And they vote the way they want, they politically do what they're told, but that's the beginning.
[01:57:00.335 --> 01:57:01.917]  This is a permanent underclass.
[01:57:02.959 --> 01:57:03.560]  You bring them in...
[01:57:04.858 --> 01:57:11.882]  You got your yogurt factory, you control them, you shake them down, you know, you got your factory, whatever.
[01:57:12.302 --> 01:57:13.363]  That's how slavery works.
[01:57:13.383 --> 01:57:16.665]  These are sweatshops being set up in America with slaves.
[01:57:17.305 --> 01:57:21.848]  Then you sell them heroin, they rob everybody for the money, and you get it.
[01:57:21.888 --> 01:57:25.730]  That's the Democrat plantation.
[01:57:27.351 --> 01:57:32.454]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[01:57:34.784 --> 01:57:36.345]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[01:57:36.385 --> 01:57:36.986]  It's a good thing.
[01:57:37.026 --> 01:57:40.229]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[01:57:40.789 --> 01:57:43.211]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[01:57:43.231 --> 01:57:44.312]  I learned what the best was.
[01:57:44.992 --> 01:57:58.243]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[01:57:58.744 --> 01:58:03.728]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[01:58:03.888 --> 01:58:08.333]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[01:58:08.833 --> 01:58:11.175]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[01:58:11.876 --> 01:58:16.261]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[01:58:17.919 --> 01:58:19.620]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[01:58:20.401 --> 01:58:22.682]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[01:58:22.702 --> 01:58:30.107]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[01:58:30.308 --> 01:58:33.029]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:35.611]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:36.572]  Texas has that too.
[01:58:37.072 --> 01:58:40.835]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[01:58:41.395 --> 01:58:44.217]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[01:58:46.772 --> 01:58:50.754]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[01:58:51.114 --> 01:58:53.195]  We normally sell for $249 and it's a great deal.
[01:58:53.795 --> 01:58:56.956]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[01:58:57.297 --> 01:58:57.617]  It's $127.
[01:58:58.337 --> 01:59:02.119]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[01:59:02.899 --> 01:59:04.080]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:06.221]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[01:59:06.261 --> 01:59:07.241]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[01:59:07.401 --> 01:59:08.442]  This is insane.
[01:59:08.802 --> 01:59:10.563]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[01:59:11.003 --> 01:59:12.964]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[01:59:12.984 --> 01:59:14.364]  Get the best, the best deal.
[01:59:14.765 --> 01:59:16.966]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[01:59:17.066 --> 01:59:17.586]  It's amazing.
[01:59:17.666 --> 01:59:23.709]  Alexa Pure Pro at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:29.304 --> 01:59:33.416]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:33.938 --> 01:59:35.242]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:59:44.096 --> 01:59:51.540]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:59.644]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:59:59.904 --> 02:00:02.005]  As president, I will make it clear.
[02:00:02.865 --> 02:00:07.646]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:00:08.187 --> 02:00:13.548]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:00:13.588 --> 02:00:16.789]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:00:16.969 --> 02:00:19.970]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:00:20.010 --> 02:00:22.571]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:00:24.935 --> 02:00:26.957]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:00:27.357 --> 02:00:30.661]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:00:31.021 --> 02:00:38.909]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:00:40.836 --> 02:00:41.296]  The U.S.
[02:00:41.356 --> 02:00:44.959]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:00:45.319 --> 02:00:52.944]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:00:53.305 --> 02:00:55.646]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:00:55.666 --> 02:01:00.089]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[02:01:00.309 --> 02:01:04.392]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:01:04.412 --> 02:01:06.634]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:01:10.481 --> 02:01:14.889]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:01:43.368 --> 02:01:53.775]  By the way, I was told Hillary Clinton specifically complained about that video we put out about a week before the election that got 20 million views or so on different platforms.
[02:01:54.696 --> 02:02:02.201]  She particularly did not like that little campaign ad because she'd said she wanted to go to war with Russia and all the rest of it.
[02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:06.844]  Many analysts said that there was a much better chance we'd end up having a war if she was in office.
[02:02:09.806 --> 02:02:11.427]  And that's why they want to solve it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.961]  Now we have a guest joining us who's in the UK, an expert on Brexit.
[02:02:17.841 --> 02:02:20.562]  And their fight is our fight here.
[02:02:22.442 --> 02:02:26.963]  The unelected globalism that they're under is the same globalist we're under.
[02:02:27.783 --> 02:02:38.006]  And so any setback they have in Brazil, or they have in the continent of Europe, or they have in the UK, or they have in Asia or Africa, is a setback for them here as well.
[02:02:38.146 --> 02:02:39.506]  So it is a global fight.
[02:02:40.538 --> 02:02:44.322]  We're involved in a global fight that we are engaged in.
[02:02:44.342 --> 02:02:50.889]  We're going to be looking at all that coming up at the bottom of the hour on this live Friday edition.
[02:02:50.909 --> 02:02:55.815]  But I want to get into the casino gulag system.
[02:02:56.974 --> 02:03:01.235]  And what the whole digital system is going to be like when we come back from break.
[02:03:01.976 --> 02:03:09.138]  An amusement tax forced on PlayStation gamers right here in America.
[02:03:10.358 --> 02:03:12.959]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:32.008]  On the other side of this break and looking at what the panopticonic censorship and control is going to be like as a society and a civilization with the whole global social credit score that is galloping, galloping forward at light speed.
[02:03:34.107 --> 02:03:36.929]  We're also going to look at Juncker, speaking of the EU at the bottom of the hour.
[02:03:37.650 --> 02:03:40.132]  Videos up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:03:40.712 --> 02:03:42.474]  Appears incapable of dressing himself.
[02:03:43.514 --> 02:03:52.301]  Wait till you see this and some of his other antics because as bad as stuff is, you look at who's controlling everything, they're not invincible.
[02:03:53.382 --> 02:03:58.366]  He's wearing black shoe and brown shoe and has to be told by them because he's so incredibly drunk.
[02:03:59.026 --> 02:04:00.187]  We've got some of these other videos.
[02:04:00.588 --> 02:04:02.249]  But he's the unelected head of the EU.
[02:04:05.038 --> 02:04:13.063]  And, you know, there's the EU working with Africa to open the borders up at this migration meeting, so he can bring in more third-world populations he can use as a political weapon.
[02:04:13.804 --> 02:04:20.768]  About 90% of the illegal aliens they bring in and legalize, get put on welfare, and five years after are not off of it.
[02:04:21.508 --> 02:04:25.131]  They want permanent class they control.
[02:04:25.231 --> 02:04:26.652]  It's a very simple equation.
[02:04:27.652 --> 02:04:31.314]  Also coming up, some Christians say, at least I'll be able to go to my church.
[02:04:31.334 --> 02:04:31.374]  No!
[02:04:32.512 --> 02:04:34.473]  Now the courts are going to make you have atheist preachers.
[02:04:34.493 --> 02:04:34.974]  I'm not kidding.
[02:04:53.965 --> 02:04:57.370]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:04:57.671 --> 02:05:03.879]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.209]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:17.691]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[02:05:17.951 --> 02:05:24.853]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[02:05:25.033 --> 02:05:29.414]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[02:05:29.874 --> 02:05:37.256]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:49.102 --> 02:05:54.036]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.926 --> 02:06:21.968]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here in our number three on this worldwide transmission.
[02:06:22.108 --> 02:06:23.568]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.529 --> 02:06:41.915]  I want to go into the netherworld of the digital cashless society and all the unprecedented abuses and control and social engineering that are going to come with it in the architects of this system's own admissions.
[02:06:43.223 --> 02:06:45.324]  So that's coming up in just a few minutes.
[02:06:46.225 --> 02:06:47.806]  First off, I didn't plug last hour.
[02:06:47.826 --> 02:06:49.527]  I get so busy, so focused on the news.
[02:06:50.628 --> 02:06:51.529]  We are listener supported.
[02:06:52.409 --> 02:07:02.436]  And we finance with high quality supplements, with t-shirts, with books, with films, with amazing water filtration systems, with amazing air filtration systems, with everything.
[02:07:03.417 --> 02:07:10.362]  And we go out and find whatever the very best is, whether it's supplements or water filtration or air filtration, and we become dealers in it.
[02:07:11.198 --> 02:07:15.300]  And we become the biggest sellers of it by selling it at the lowest price.
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:17.082]  Let me make a big announcement.
[02:07:17.642 --> 02:07:19.943]  Everyone should do their Christmas shopping now.
[02:07:22.004 --> 02:07:25.547]  For a particular item, that's at infowarestore.com.
[02:07:25.947 --> 02:07:26.947]  Alexa Pure Pro.
[02:07:27.968 --> 02:07:37.834]  Alexa Pure Pro is the top-of-the-line, stainless steel, gravity-fed, water filtration system that cuts out all the garbage, the hundreds of chemicals,
[02:07:39.025 --> 02:07:41.507]  But lets the good minerals and things go through.
[02:07:41.947 --> 02:07:45.330]  Reverse osmosis long term is very, very bad because it cuts everything out.
[02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:47.391]  This leaves the good minerals in.
[02:07:49.313 --> 02:07:51.354]  It's the system I've chosen for my family.
[02:07:51.694 --> 02:07:53.556]  I've bought it for a gift for many people.
[02:07:54.568 --> 02:08:01.193]  There are a lot of companies and units out there that in the past were pretty good companies, but over time they lower quality.
[02:08:01.853 --> 02:08:03.695]  AlexaPure has never done that.
[02:08:03.735 --> 02:08:11.560]  So any water filtration systems you see at InfoWareStore.com are the highest rated, and I've personally used them, and we've gotten great customer reviews for years.
[02:08:12.061 --> 02:08:13.442]  And ProPure is excellent as well.
[02:08:13.922 --> 02:08:18.485]  You know, each system is apples and oranges of the other, but, and it's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:08:19.926 --> 02:08:20.787]  But AlexaPure,
[02:08:23.581 --> 02:08:26.603]  Pro is their big, nice, top-of-the-line stainless steel model.
[02:08:26.703 --> 02:08:27.524]  All their models are great.
[02:08:29.645 --> 02:08:34.468]  But this particular deal is a one-time thing.
[02:08:34.488 --> 02:08:44.415]  I've been selling high-quality water filtration for 20-plus years, and it's an absolute must to have, but this system
[02:08:46.294 --> 02:08:47.315]  He's already the best out there.
[02:08:47.335 --> 02:08:50.857]  They have competitors that are similar to this, that are $350.
[02:08:50.897 --> 02:08:54.219]  Normally at $240, it's a great deal.
[02:08:54.959 --> 02:08:55.239]  Okay?
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:00.182]  But when we discount, it's usually $199 for the big one.
[02:09:02.763 --> 02:09:08.847]  The owner of the company ordered thousands and thousands, a couple thousand extra than they project they'll sell by the end of the year.
[02:09:09.287 --> 02:09:10.328]  They don't want to have to pay.
[02:09:12.042 --> 02:09:16.426]  The state franchise taxes, or the state income taxes, depending on what state you're in.
[02:09:16.446 --> 02:09:17.727]  Texas is called a franchise tax.
[02:09:18.207 --> 02:09:19.809]  Any inventory we have, same thing.
[02:09:20.309 --> 02:09:21.590]  There's a percentage we've got to pay on it.
[02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:24.072]  That's why you hear car dealers say, end of the year, must go.
[02:09:24.112 --> 02:09:25.153]  That is the best deals of the year.
[02:09:25.413 --> 02:09:32.720]  You can probably get three, four, five thousand dollars off a vehicle you couldn't have gotten if it's that year and they've got to pay inventory on it.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:36.563]  And then at first, for a few months, there's not a lot of cars in the dealership because the new ones are coming in.
[02:09:37.103 --> 02:09:37.724]  It's the same thing.
[02:09:39.241 --> 02:09:43.004]  This is top-of-the-line, super-high-quality water filtration system.
[02:09:43.284 --> 02:09:45.066]  The best they've got, the biggest they've got.
[02:09:45.586 --> 02:09:48.648]  Stainless steel, super-high-quality with the filters for $127.
[02:09:48.688 --> 02:09:48.648]  $127.
[02:09:49.169 --> 02:09:56.695]  And I can tell you, we're getting it at their cost, 90-something dollars.
[02:09:57.375 --> 02:09:59.037]  So, it helps fund the Infowar.
[02:09:59.417 --> 02:10:01.038]  You get the best deal ever on a filter.
[02:10:02.419 --> 02:10:03.260]  $200 is a steal.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.702]  That's normally our discount when we're discounting it.
[02:10:05.762 --> 02:10:06.122]  This is $127.
[02:10:08.874 --> 02:10:14.999]  Alex, a pure pro, and maybe you already have a system.
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:17.160]  Give it as a gift.
[02:10:17.801 --> 02:10:19.142]  Explain to people what's going on in the water.
[02:10:20.663 --> 02:10:22.024]  It is a total 360 win.
[02:10:22.104 --> 02:10:33.112]  Fund the InfoWarb, get the Alexa Pure Breeze, and take care of yourself and your children, because the stuff that's in the water is just unspeakable, especially in big cities, but also in rural areas.
[02:10:33.172 --> 02:10:37.075]  If you're getting most well water, unless it's out of an aquifer,
[02:10:38.476 --> 02:10:41.178]  The biggest thing you can do for your family is purify your water.
[02:11:03.519 --> 02:11:07.242]  It's the number one thing to remove so much of the garbage that's out there.
[02:11:07.502 --> 02:11:12.626]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration 127 at InfowarStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:11:12.646 --> 02:11:14.547]  And then separately, please don't forget,
[02:11:22.145 --> 02:11:32.511]  We only have until Sunday with a 67% off on the colloidal silver, 50% off on brain force, 57% off on super metal vitality, and a bunch of other our best-selling items.
[02:11:32.971 --> 02:11:35.533]  We had to end that big store wide, so a lot of stuff was about to sell out.
[02:11:35.573 --> 02:11:42.657]  These are best sellers that are not close to selling out for a while, so we're still able to offer this to you at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:11:44.538 --> 02:11:46.839]  Okay, let's start getting into this right now.
[02:11:53.490 --> 02:12:02.973]  When we talk about taxation and we talk about regulation, it's important to remember what George Washington said, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:12:05.374 --> 02:12:22.120]  And if you look at the models in the last 20 years that the globalist futurists were putting out, they said, look, we're going to make humanity in jobs from farming to industrial work, to load scale labor, obsolete.
[02:12:23.134 --> 02:12:24.795]  We've got a ballooning population.
[02:12:25.635 --> 02:12:29.557]  We're also going to then build a world where humans are obsolete.
[02:12:29.817 --> 02:12:38.821]  But there's nobody at the checkout counter, and there's nobody at the restaurant, and robots cook your food, and a robot waitress comes over, or you program it into a control panel.
[02:12:40.142 --> 02:12:40.682]  It's all there.
[02:12:41.302 --> 02:12:50.507]  And it's being done to make humans obsolete, so then the big industrialized system run by the technocrats can dictate to you
[02:12:52.318 --> 02:13:03.393]  What type of job you get, what type of food you get, when you get to vacation, because you've been made obsolete, and now these big mega-cores, and these big corporate systems,
[02:13:04.761 --> 02:13:20.374]  They have a planned economy and so you now socially have to behave the way they want or you don't get a job, you don't get your ration credits because again you've been put in an artificial construct where humans no longer have any value.
[02:13:20.414 --> 02:13:31.283]  You've let them put you in an artificial biosphere where you are nothing but a complete negative and truly are a parasite not contributing.
[02:13:31.543 --> 02:13:32.624]  And a microcosm is
[02:13:34.485 --> 02:13:37.867]  Forty years ago, they came out with a Texas Instruments calculator.
[02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:43.410]  They come out with a calculator.
[02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:44.150]  Sounds great.
[02:13:44.291 --> 02:13:45.371]  Sounds like it's a lot of fun.
[02:13:45.771 --> 02:13:46.392]  Makes it easy.
[02:13:46.872 --> 02:13:53.596]  People go from knowing how to do arithmetic in their minds and on paper to almost no one knowing how to do basic math now.
[02:13:55.728 --> 02:14:02.752]  You start making the rifles, where they're automated and computerized, where snipers can shoot people at a half mile away better than the best sniper could before.
[02:14:03.092 --> 02:14:05.853]  It puts in Coriolis, it puts in windage, it puts it all in.
[02:14:05.913 --> 02:14:11.876]  But soon, no one knows how to actually shoot a rifle, and people being good riflemen are gone.
[02:14:14.217 --> 02:14:24.843]  Same thing is, they're having more and more crash landings, more and more problems, because pilots really don't know how to fly planes anymore, the younger ones, because everything is really already automated in large aircraft.
[02:14:26.104 --> 02:14:27.865]  Then they make you go to automation in cars.
[02:14:28.145 --> 02:14:30.787]  Then they make you go to automation in trucks.
[02:14:31.367 --> 02:14:32.248]  In the name of safety.
[02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:34.649]  The self-driving cars are already here.
[02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:35.910]  The new Audis are coming out.
[02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:36.931]  New Mercedes this year.
[02:14:37.271 --> 02:14:38.752]  That already control how you drive.
[02:14:39.032 --> 02:14:46.117]  If you get out of the confines it believes you should be driving via its GPS and computerized systems, it simply takes control.
[02:14:48.362 --> 02:14:58.285]  And so we're being inducted into a machine interface takeover that in every case and in every study and every program makes us physically weaker, makes us mentally weaker.
[02:14:59.406 --> 02:15:02.027]  They're getting rid of knowing how to write with a pencil or a pen.
[02:15:02.207 --> 02:15:03.307]  They're getting rid of cursive.
[02:15:03.687 --> 02:15:05.168]  They're getting rid of regular language.
[02:15:05.368 --> 02:15:06.748]  The language is shrinking.
[02:15:07.048 --> 02:15:08.349]  The IQ is dropping.
[02:15:08.589 --> 02:15:10.429]  The sperm count is plunging.
[02:15:10.529 --> 02:15:11.730]  We are dying.
[02:15:13.413 --> 02:15:14.954]  It's not the technology makes us weak.
[02:15:15.234 --> 02:15:19.717]  The technology's been designed from the beginning to take us over.
[02:15:20.657 --> 02:15:22.498]  Almost as if it's been done before.
[02:15:23.299 --> 02:15:27.281]  Almost as if we're just another experiment.
[02:15:28.722 --> 02:15:29.102]  You understand?
[02:15:29.122 --> 02:15:33.044]  When we come back, we're gonna look into this nightmare world and where it's going to take us.
[02:15:33.305 --> 02:15:33.725]  Stay with us.
[02:15:37.799 --> 02:15:40.981]  There's only three days left for the mega-sales.
[02:15:41.301 --> 02:15:43.822]  67% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:15:43.942 --> 02:15:45.963]  And don't forget, free shipping store-wide.
[02:15:46.003 --> 02:15:47.564]  That all ends in just three days.
[02:15:54.085 --> 02:15:58.847]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[02:15:58.867 --> 02:16:15.873]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[02:16:16.354 --> 02:16:16.994]  But is it true?
[02:16:17.914 --> 02:16:24.378]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[02:16:25.379 --> 02:16:28.921]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[02:16:29.882 --> 02:16:31.263]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:34.225]  And so the establishment wants us off the air again.
[02:16:35.197 --> 02:16:40.403]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[02:16:40.743 --> 02:16:41.203]  to 3 p.m.
[02:16:41.243 --> 02:16:42.164]  just on my show.
[02:16:42.324 --> 02:16:44.867]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[02:16:44.907 --> 02:16:45.227]  Central.
[02:16:45.668 --> 02:16:49.132]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:16:49.152 --> 02:16:49.752]  in the War Room.
[02:16:49.992 --> 02:16:51.994]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[02:16:52.435 --> 02:16:53.176]  They're trying to block that.
[02:16:54.073 --> 02:16:57.876]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[02:16:58.537 --> 02:17:05.643]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[02:17:06.163 --> 02:17:08.705]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[02:17:09.486 --> 02:17:13.508]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[02:17:14.108 --> 02:17:15.109]  Kick us off PayPal.
[02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:16.049]  Kick us off Facebook.
[02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.909]  Kick us off Twitter.
[02:17:16.929 --> 02:17:17.550]  Kick us off YouTube.
[02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:24.373]  And over a hundred other platforms now where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[02:17:24.953 --> 02:17:33.017]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[02:17:33.057 --> 02:17:35.098]  That's because we are on target.
[02:17:35.158 --> 02:17:37.299]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[02:17:37.339 --> 02:17:39.220]  We're exposing their main operation.
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:41.341]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[02:17:41.781 --> 02:17:43.542]  That's why you've supported us.
[02:17:43.762 --> 02:17:48.745]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:17:50.005 --> 02:17:51.946]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[02:17:51.966 --> 02:18:02.211]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[02:18:02.571 --> 02:18:03.631]  To hand-share those links.
[02:18:03.691 --> 02:18:05.252]  To text message people.
[02:18:05.632 --> 02:18:07.694]  Information you think is particularly important.
[02:18:07.734 --> 02:18:09.075]  To get around the censors.
[02:18:09.115 --> 02:18:10.456]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[02:18:10.956 --> 02:18:14.478]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[02:18:14.739 --> 02:18:17.581]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:18:17.621 --> 02:18:23.825]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[02:18:26.327 --> 02:18:29.489]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:18:29.749 --> 02:18:31.690]  They're all there at infowarrestore.com.
[02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:32.330]  Patriot apparel.
[02:18:32.970 --> 02:18:33.510]  It's all there.
[02:18:34.791 --> 02:18:42.314]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items.
[02:18:46.136 --> 02:19:00.033]  We already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[02:19:00.894 --> 02:19:03.837]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[02:19:04.237 --> 02:19:08.641]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[02:19:08.661 --> 02:19:15.526]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WordsTour.com, M4WordsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:15.927 --> 02:19:17.368]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[02:19:17.388 --> 02:19:18.749]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.490]  30% off.
[02:19:19.710 --> 02:19:21.331]  Everybody really loves our coiled silver.
[02:19:21.512 --> 02:19:23.914]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[02:19:24.634 --> 02:19:30.977]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:30.997 --> 02:19:37.079]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[02:19:40.441 --> 02:19:43.082]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:06.417 --> 02:20:07.598]  You know, sometimes.
[02:20:17.384 --> 02:20:18.725]  So, it's all admitted.
[02:20:18.905 --> 02:20:20.065]  Nation states can't exist.
[02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.166]  Families can't exist.
[02:20:21.686 --> 02:20:23.427]  They want you as weak and dumb as you can.
[02:20:23.828 --> 02:20:26.249]  Colleges all over Europe, all over the U.S.
[02:20:26.689 --> 02:20:30.071]  If people are upset about anything, they're taught to flop around like two-year-olds.
[02:20:30.372 --> 02:20:34.074]  They play with Play-Doh and construction paper, but they can't have scissors.
[02:20:35.205 --> 02:20:36.306]  This is 20-year-old people.
[02:20:37.567 --> 02:20:40.490]  Meanwhile, young children are being taught that whites are inherently evil.
[02:20:41.130 --> 02:20:47.976]  They showed that video from a public YouTube series where they're taught communism and the hatred of America.
[02:20:50.038 --> 02:20:52.961]  And the hatred of men, white men specifically.
[02:20:53.942 --> 02:20:54.082]  Now,
[02:20:55.845 --> 02:20:59.368]  Let's get into where this is going, because this is the corporatist.
[02:20:59.788 --> 02:21:12.638]  Remember Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, you can pull it up, would not allow their sons, their daughters access to any digital phones, any computers, any iPads, nothing.
[02:21:14.239 --> 02:21:24.187]  They were allowed to technically, with textbooks, learn how they work, and learn with limited programs how the guts worked, but not the propaganda.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:25.821]  They were putting out.
[02:21:26.301 --> 02:21:29.023]  Because Zuckerberg and others, they're the ruling class.
[02:21:29.444 --> 02:21:36.830]  Zuckerberg's employees are ordered to put on VR goggles and hunch over, but he walks bipedally above them.
[02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:38.071]  Maybe we can pull that up.
[02:21:38.652 --> 02:21:39.993]  The shot that tells it all.
[02:21:41.594 --> 02:21:42.695]  So, where is it going?
[02:21:45.698 --> 02:21:46.559]  Where is it going here?
[02:21:46.579 --> 02:21:52.684]  Again, if you're a radio listener, remember, my crew's so good, everything I say they put on screen within seconds.
[02:21:54.266 --> 02:21:55.567]  Or I flip out, which is not good.
[02:21:57.948 --> 02:21:59.489]  I tell you, Steve Jobs didn't let his kids have it.
[02:21:59.569 --> 02:22:00.950]  I tell you, Bill Gates didn't let his kids have it.
[02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:02.991]  I tell you, this stuff, it's true.
[02:22:03.832 --> 02:22:07.574]  Now, TV viewers are like, yeah, we're watching it.
[02:22:07.594 --> 02:22:10.536]  So, I was told this by Max Keiser.
[02:22:10.756 --> 02:22:13.478]  And Max is a great guy, but you notice Max doesn't come on anymore.
[02:22:14.178 --> 02:22:16.119]  Because Max got in some trouble.
[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:20.122]  Max is very good friends with George Soros' sons.
[02:22:21.966 --> 02:22:22.866]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:22:23.906 --> 02:22:25.567]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:22:25.587 --> 02:22:26.127]  I'm going to stop.
[02:22:26.147 --> 02:22:27.227]  I'm about to start saying some things.
[02:22:27.247 --> 02:22:27.867]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:22:28.007 --> 02:22:28.587]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:22:28.687 --> 02:22:29.267]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:22:29.488 --> 02:22:30.228]  I said I wouldn't say it.
[02:22:32.828 --> 02:22:36.269]  Anyways, that's why he told us about this ten years ago, the exact plan.
[02:22:37.449 --> 02:22:39.350]  But I'm not supposed to tell you the part about the soros.
[02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:40.770]  So forget I said that, actually.
[02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:44.010]  See, I never break confidences and now I'm about to do it.
[02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:46.011]  Oh my God.
[02:22:46.051 --> 02:22:48.231]  See, if I ever do stuff like this, people will stop telling me things.
[02:22:48.251 --> 02:22:51.472]  But I... At a certain point, I just...
[02:22:52.768 --> 02:22:54.269]  This is criminal, so I should tell you.
[02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:57.692]  I'm going to go crazy.
[02:22:57.712 --> 02:22:58.472]  I can't handle it anymore.
[02:22:58.753 --> 02:23:00.254]  Why do I have to put up with this?
[02:23:00.534 --> 02:23:02.295]  Why don't people say no to this crap?
[02:23:04.377 --> 02:23:05.778]  I'm not going to tell you what I was going to tell you.
[02:23:05.798 --> 02:23:06.819]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:23:07.099 --> 02:23:09.081]  And I'm not putting an act on here, guys.
[02:23:09.121 --> 02:23:10.382]  I'm actually going crazy right now.
[02:23:11.603 --> 02:23:20.009]  I mean, I went out to eat with my wife last night for her 40th birthday, and her birthday's not yet.
[02:23:23.865 --> 02:23:24.646]  Time to go out till now.
[02:23:26.428 --> 02:23:30.693]  And I had multiple leftists come over and say things to me.
[02:23:31.634 --> 02:23:32.275]  Which is fine.
[02:23:32.976 --> 02:23:37.661]  Except they're so mentally ill and so stupid, they don't know that I'm their friend.
[02:23:37.681 --> 02:23:40.685]  Because you wanted to go to this trendy sushi place.
[02:23:40.985 --> 02:23:42.006]  Doesn't happen most places.
[02:23:42.026 --> 02:23:42.567]  And it was good.
[02:23:43.968 --> 02:24:08.156]  And I'm in there, and I'm like, most people like me, but I don't care that they hate me, it's that they really think I'm the bad guy, when all I'm trying to do is warn everybody, and I've been proven consistently right about all this stuff, over and over and over and over and over and over again, and now it's passé what I cover, because it's all the really bad stuff about to happen now, and is happening.
[02:24:09.642 --> 02:24:11.263]  China's about four years ahead of us.
[02:24:11.703 --> 02:24:13.383]  The EU's about two years ahead of us.
[02:24:13.784 --> 02:24:15.604]  Venezuela is about a year ahead of us.
[02:24:16.985 --> 02:24:20.846]  And there's an exact plan, and I've got all the articles today admitting all of it.
[02:24:21.266 --> 02:24:24.428]  You think I get happy when everything we predicted comes exactly true?
[02:24:27.769 --> 02:24:29.430]  Anyways, Max Keiser is a good guy.
[02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:32.831]  You know, he knows the Soros's and people.
[02:24:32.851 --> 02:24:35.372]  I think he said that on air a few times, so I can say that on air.
[02:24:36.491 --> 02:24:38.293]  And they kind of told him what was coming in the future.
[02:24:38.313 --> 02:24:43.937]  You know, you don't just think Max came up with the casino gulag all by himself.
[02:24:45.278 --> 02:24:47.840]  No, what's going to happen is no one's going to have any jobs.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:49.462]  We're going to be forcefully displaced from them.
[02:24:51.083 --> 02:24:52.564]  Men have been turned into jellyfish.
[02:24:52.644 --> 02:24:57.188]  Women will be on these power trippers that are just worshiping the state and think not having kids is cool.
[02:24:58.009 --> 02:24:58.509]  And we're done.
[02:24:59.510 --> 02:25:03.813]  And then you will be paid, you will be paid
[02:25:04.855 --> 02:25:13.641]  If you win the video games, and that'll be your job that you play all day, but when you lose, you will have to pay money.
[02:25:15.203 --> 02:25:19.906]  But just like Ready Player One that they push on you, that's actually the plan.
[02:25:21.027 --> 02:25:25.130]  But Kaiser told you on the air here 15 years ago, not in Ready Player One.
[02:25:26.573 --> 02:25:28.634]  So, they're really building that.
[02:25:28.794 --> 02:25:29.794]  This isn't a game.
[02:25:30.134 --> 02:25:31.014]  This isn't funny.
[02:25:31.494 --> 02:25:32.495]  This is really happening.
[02:25:32.675 --> 02:25:33.915]  And Kaiser is just one of the sources.
[02:25:35.035 --> 02:25:35.996]  Amusement tax.
[02:25:36.036 --> 02:25:37.696]  This is a Kit Daniels article.
[02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:43.557]  Everyone might want to read this on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:25:43.918 --> 02:25:48.559]  NewsWars.com isn't as blacklisted and blocked, so it'll share better if you share it from NewsWars.com.
[02:25:48.859 --> 02:25:51.260]  And by the way, NewsWars is now a quarter of the size of InfoWars.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:52.660]  It's now a big old
[02:25:53.663 --> 02:25:55.524]  Big ol', big ol' website.
[02:25:55.964 --> 02:25:57.405]  He got a big ol' ding-a-ling.
[02:25:58.105 --> 02:26:03.247]  Amusement tax forced on PlayStation gamers in Chicago.
[02:26:04.508 --> 02:26:09.410]  There's only one cesspit worse than San Francisco or L.A., and that's Chicago, the testbed.
[02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:10.991]  Well, I guess New York's a close third.
[02:26:12.672 --> 02:26:16.993]  Shitty owes $130 billion to public pensions, according to reports.
[02:26:17.073 --> 02:26:17.554]  So now,
[02:26:18.686 --> 02:26:19.487]  It's like drugs.
[02:26:19.827 --> 02:26:29.372]  The left always brings drugs in, then has people use it, then lets the criminals rob poorer areas to pay the money back to the government that brings the drugs in, in the Democrat areas.
[02:26:30.093 --> 02:26:40.759]  Well now, this is their drug on dopamine, and so when you want to sign up for PlayStation every year, and notice it's PlayStation and Microsoft working with the government,
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:46.844]  And other video game companies to totally control your life and tax everything you do.
[02:26:46.904 --> 02:26:48.866]  So it's that seamless integration.
[02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:55.092]  PlayStation gamers are now forced to pay an amusement tax in Chicago as city officials tax everything
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:59.742]  To cover underfunded public pensions.
[02:26:59.942 --> 02:27:02.463]  But don't worry, let's bring in more illegal aliens to bankrupt things.
[02:27:02.483 --> 02:27:03.264]  That'll fix it, right?
[02:27:03.664 --> 02:27:14.029]  Gamers were recently notified that they would have to pay a 9% levy every time they pay for PlayStation subscription services such as PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music!
[02:27:15.029 --> 02:27:21.851]  The city's amusement tax, which used to apply mostly to concert and sporting event tickets, was extended to include streaming services.
[02:27:21.911 --> 02:27:23.312]  That means now your digital devices.
[02:27:23.712 --> 02:27:24.732]  Report to the Chicago Tribune.
[02:27:25.052 --> 02:27:29.374]  That includes charges paid for playing games, according to Chicago Finance Department.
[02:27:30.319 --> 02:27:33.741]  Spotify, Netflix, and Hulu were already collecting the tax on consumers.
[02:27:34.141 --> 02:27:35.743]  Apple, on the other hand, took the city to court.
[02:27:36.343 --> 02:27:38.444]  Chicago, they never pay any tax.
[02:27:38.784 --> 02:27:39.645]  They just run slave camps.
[02:27:40.225 --> 02:27:42.147]  They're on the top of the pyramid, bitches, not the bottom.
[02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:47.690]  Chicago forced the tax on gamers after the city fell $130 million in pension debt.
[02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:48.791]  Now, that's just an example.
[02:27:50.199 --> 02:27:51.962]  And that means total control, total surveillance.
[02:27:52.002 --> 02:27:54.526]  Now here's the big enchilada, as they say.
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:28:01.216]  Venezuela is releasing an ID card that can track and punish citizens.
[02:28:02.048 --> 02:28:09.730]  And then they later admit, okay, it's really the global social score that tracks everything you do, and China built it, and it's coming to America.
[02:28:10.271 --> 02:28:11.991]  Coming to America!
[02:28:12.011 --> 02:28:12.551]  Here's Reuters.
[02:28:13.412 --> 02:28:14.652]  Right here, I just showed you Reuters.
[02:28:15.272 --> 02:28:19.534]  Chinese telecom giant building Venezuela's social credit system!
[02:28:20.134 --> 02:28:23.495]  It's called, wait for it, the Fatherland card!
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:31.103]  We have the Chinese dictator, with the dictator of Venezuela, marching together in a military parade.
[02:28:32.024 --> 02:28:32.964]  Oh yeah, baby!
[02:28:32.984 --> 02:28:35.146]  Oh, they got a plan for you!
[02:28:36.815 --> 02:28:42.536]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[02:28:42.837 --> 02:28:46.858]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[02:28:47.298 --> 02:28:49.518]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[02:28:49.538 --> 02:28:51.659]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[02:28:52.019 --> 02:28:54.019]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[02:28:54.539 --> 02:28:54.780]  Boom!
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:57.320]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[02:28:57.660 --> 02:28:59.221]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[02:28:59.281 --> 02:29:01.101]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[02:29:01.161 --> 02:29:02.281]  You still have a shopfront.
[02:29:02.481 --> 02:29:03.262]  And then what do we see?
[02:29:03.542 --> 02:29:04.302]  Washington Post.
[02:29:04.862 --> 02:29:07.984]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[02:29:09.365 --> 02:29:12.467]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[02:29:12.487 --> 02:29:15.329]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[02:29:15.629 --> 02:29:21.052]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:25.875]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is.
[02:29:26.215 --> 02:29:28.337]  To fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[02:29:28.657 --> 02:29:32.080]  We're not funded by Gulf State dictatorships like CNN is.
[02:29:32.341 --> 02:29:33.422]  We're only funded by you.
[02:29:33.802 --> 02:29:35.824]  By getting the products at infootballstore.com.
[02:29:38.015 --> 02:29:38.155]  E.T.
[02:29:38.495 --> 02:29:39.276]  on in Texas.
[02:29:39.296 --> 02:29:39.897]  You're on the air.
[02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:40.237]  Go ahead.
[02:29:40.837 --> 02:29:41.378]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:41.438 --> 02:29:42.178]  How's it going?
[02:29:42.398 --> 02:29:42.819]  Greetings.
[02:29:43.159 --> 02:29:43.499]  Greetings.
[02:29:43.519 --> 02:29:43.879]  Welcome.
[02:29:43.899 --> 02:29:46.662]  America is for President Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:29:46.842 --> 02:29:56.028]  Anything else, any other person, Hispanic, who wants to consider themselves an American or anything other than a real Jesus Christ believer is a fake and is a terrorist.
[02:29:56.089 --> 02:30:00.352]  So what I'm bringing out to you, brother, is may God bless you, the Infowars team.
[02:30:00.592 --> 02:30:02.173]  I appreciate all of your products.
[02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:05.315]  I just received it on Monday and I see the results.
[02:30:05.495 --> 02:30:06.076]  It's beautiful.
[02:30:06.096 --> 02:30:06.476]  It's awesome.
[02:30:06.516 --> 02:30:07.497]  I've been a long time believer.
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:12.821]  God bless you, Etion.
[02:30:12.982 --> 02:30:14.123]  I never plug Icarin.
[02:30:14.203 --> 02:30:17.786]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there and make it even stronger and better.
[02:30:17.806 --> 02:30:18.787]  What has the best ratings, name it.
[02:30:18.807 --> 02:30:22.229]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[02:30:22.269 --> 02:30:24.952]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[02:30:24.972 --> 02:30:29.215]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler because they're scared of real supplements.
[02:30:29.255 --> 02:30:34.179]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[02:30:34.199 --> 02:30:35.621]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[02:30:37.011 --> 02:30:40.453]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:30:40.953 --> 02:30:43.714]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:30:44.254 --> 02:30:50.037]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:30:50.517 --> 02:30:53.299]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:30:54.019 --> 02:30:57.483]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:30:57.843 --> 02:31:03.909]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:31:04.330 --> 02:31:09.295]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:31:10.034 --> 02:31:13.436]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:31:13.956 --> 02:31:20.500]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:25.842]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:31:26.423 --> 02:31:31.485]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:31:32.066 --> 02:31:36.048]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:31:36.923 --> 02:31:38.684]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[02:31:39.244 --> 02:31:44.425]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[02:32:41.471 --> 02:32:44.133]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.483 --> 02:33:11.365]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[02:33:11.385 --> 02:33:19.672]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[02:33:20.132 --> 02:33:22.614]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[02:33:22.634 --> 02:33:24.095]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:33:24.455 --> 02:33:26.317]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:28.700]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:30.021]  This is all confirmed.
[02:33:30.041 --> 02:33:30.982]  This is not a drill.
[02:33:31.142 --> 02:33:35.066]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:33:35.426 --> 02:33:36.848]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:33:36.948 --> 02:33:37.429]  Apple 100%.
[02:33:37.829 --> 02:33:43.455]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:33:43.915 --> 02:33:48.659]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:33:48.979 --> 02:33:49.840]  This is happening.
[02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:57.787]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:33:57.887 --> 02:34:03.792]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:34:04.232 --> 02:34:12.219]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:34:13.039 --> 02:34:16.622]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:34:16.862 --> 02:34:20.104]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:34:20.324 --> 02:34:27.429]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:34:27.669 --> 02:34:30.330]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:34:30.691 --> 02:34:35.654]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[02:34:35.914 --> 02:34:38.596]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[02:34:39.036 --> 02:34:51.625]  We are now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[02:34:51.925 --> 02:34:57.089]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:34:58.181 --> 02:35:06.906]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:35:06.946 --> 02:35:11.829]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:35:12.189 --> 02:35:17.092]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[02:35:17.432 --> 02:35:25.116]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:35:25.636 --> 02:35:32.360]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:38.183]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[02:35:38.403 --> 02:35:43.145]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:35:43.326 --> 02:35:45.227]  I have given you the transmission.
[02:35:45.347 --> 02:35:45.867]  Now break free!
[02:35:50.001 --> 02:35:59.468]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:35:59.528 --> 02:36:00.629]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:07.414]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:36:07.975 --> 02:36:10.096]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:36:10.597 --> 02:36:15.761]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:36:17.276 --> 02:36:19.217]  Alexander Nikrasov is our guest.
[02:36:19.257 --> 02:36:20.117]  He's been on The Forbes.
[02:36:20.817 --> 02:36:23.578]  He's all over BBC, RT, you name it.
[02:36:24.398 --> 02:36:26.359]  He's a former Kremlin and government advisor.
[02:36:26.499 --> 02:36:29.360]  Always becomes news when he comes on, like we're not allowed to talk to people that ever worked for the Kremlin.
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:32.601]  He's a journalist and broadcaster, and he's an expert.
[02:36:32.881 --> 02:36:35.102]  He's there in the UK on the Brexit.
[02:36:36.022 --> 02:36:39.005]  And wow, did Theresa May not prove that she's a globalist.
[02:36:39.045 --> 02:36:43.189]  Three years after they voted to pull out of the unelected EU, they brought a new system in.
[02:36:43.549 --> 02:36:49.975]  Paul Watson was at Parliament, he's broken it down, saying that it literally makes them a total vassal state of the EU.
[02:36:50.035 --> 02:36:51.836]  It's even worse than the EU.
[02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:56.172]  So, Alexander, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:56.212 --> 02:36:57.553]  You're the expert on this.
[02:36:57.573 --> 02:37:00.775]  We've seen a bunch of resignations, people stepping down.
[02:37:00.795 --> 02:37:02.916]  They're saying she may be removed at any time.
[02:37:02.956 --> 02:37:04.036]  I know you've got the latest.
[02:37:04.737 --> 02:37:12.121]  Break down what's happening and why folks are saying this is such a bad deal, and is what I was just saying about this so-called Brexit deal accurate?
[02:37:14.062 --> 02:37:14.923]  Alex, hi.
[02:37:15.983 --> 02:37:20.366]  Well, first of all, I need to tell you that there's a farce going on out here.
[02:37:21.167 --> 02:37:34.473]  And all these resignations, all these statements, all these people beating their breasts and saying how passionate they are about leaving the European Union, all of it is a game.
[02:37:35.434 --> 02:37:46.219]  What we actually have here is that the so-called deal that Theresa May has come up with means that Britain is not leaving the EU.
[02:37:47.159 --> 02:37:51.403]  It's actually going to stay in the EU, but with one major difference.
[02:37:52.123 --> 02:38:05.515]  If before that it had a voice in the EU and could at least resist some of its pressure, now, according to the new deal, which I think is going to be approved, Britain will have no voice at all.
[02:38:06.296 --> 02:38:11.300]  It will continue to be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
[02:38:12.321 --> 02:38:14.663]  It will continue to be in the Customs Union.
[02:38:15.450 --> 02:38:23.637]  It will continue basically to be in the same position as it is now, but minus all of its voices taken out.
[02:38:24.537 --> 02:38:29.622]  So what we have now is Britain is going to be turned into a vessel state.
[02:38:30.382 --> 02:38:41.411]  Now, what Theresa May is saying is that allegedly this situation will only last for a while while they are trying to negotiate proper terms.
[02:38:42.492 --> 02:38:44.894]  But this situation can last forever.
[02:38:45.871 --> 02:38:49.352]  Technically, it can go on and on and on and on and on.
[02:38:50.392 --> 02:39:02.814]  And, you know, I'm watching how the British media is covering this whole thing, and it reminds me of how your American media has been covering Trump.
[02:39:03.635 --> 02:39:15.477]  You know, everybody talks in exactly the same language, uses exactly the same words, and yet nothing is being said that has anything to do with reality.
[02:39:16.368 --> 02:39:18.509]  So it's very, very similar.
[02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:20.930]  And even the Russian angle is very similar.
[02:39:21.810 --> 02:39:30.274]  As we have in America, the media is saying that Trump won because Russia helped him to win, which is rubbish, of course.
[02:39:30.914 --> 02:39:32.975]  The same thing is here in Britain.
[02:39:33.475 --> 02:39:40.758]  They're saying that Brexit has won because Russia helped it to win, which is amazing if you consider
[02:39:41.536 --> 02:39:59.541]  That the European Union probably spent millions and millions, probably tens and hundreds of millions to keep Britain in the EU to basically try to resist the vote for Brexit and then derail Brexit after the vote for Brexit won.
[02:40:00.501 --> 02:40:07.743]  And we are talking about here, about supposedly Russia having helped to win Brexit by
[02:40:08.496 --> 02:40:11.280]  Supposedly funding it with eight million pounds.
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:14.724]  Now they're investigating this funding.
[02:40:14.744 --> 02:40:21.532]  The National Criminal Agency is investigating this and this is absurd.
[02:40:22.082 --> 02:40:22.902]  This is surreal!
[02:40:23.303 --> 02:40:24.643]  Well, I've also studied it.
[02:40:24.723 --> 02:40:45.151]  Billions of pounds were spent trying to keep people in Brexit, but now, to see these resignations, I've watched the Parliament even admit that in every section May has lied, and it literally does what Hitler couldn't do to England and the UK, literally has them sign everything over to them, and that's what globalists always do, you try to get out from under them, they just double down.
[02:40:46.452 --> 02:40:48.673]  Right now, how do you expect this to unfold?
[02:40:49.994 --> 02:41:02.818]  Well, first of all, the most depressing and worrying thing about this whole idea, about this new deal, is that Britain is being dismantled, basically.
[02:41:03.278 --> 02:41:14.302]  Now, what we have here is that Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, will be basically part of the EU, separate from the rest of Britain.
[02:41:15.062 --> 02:41:18.583]  This is what nobody could have expected.
[02:41:19.164 --> 02:41:23.407]  You know, they're dismantling, slowly, they're dismantling the United Kingdom.
[02:41:24.768 --> 02:41:31.774]  After that, I expect that Scotland will start to talk about independence again.
[02:41:32.034 --> 02:41:41.341]  I mean, technically, we are looking at a scenario where the United Kingdom in a few years' time will be only England and Wales, hopefully, for them.
[02:41:42.142 --> 02:41:44.364]  And this is absolutely outrageous.
[02:41:44.444 --> 02:41:48.227]  And this plan is being sold as if it's a great idea,
[02:41:49.065 --> 02:41:53.669]  That it has been negotiated after, you know, months and months of tough negotiations.
[02:41:53.689 --> 02:41:54.931]  We're going to come back in more to this.
[02:41:54.951 --> 02:41:58.574]  What you're saying is exactly what my sources in Parliament are saying and what the document shows.
[02:41:58.614 --> 02:42:02.097]  And the EU was set up to be a super state to destroy nation states.
[02:42:02.218 --> 02:42:04.440]  And now the UK tries to pull out.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:10.065]  It gets spun by May into something that literally does what Hitler couldn't do.
[02:42:10.646 --> 02:42:12.647]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable.
[02:42:14.049 --> 02:42:18.952]  The good news is, despite the corporate press pushing this is a great deal, people are fighting back.
[02:42:19.112 --> 02:42:21.774]  Our guest will break this down on the other side.
[02:42:22.234 --> 02:42:24.295]  He's on Twitter at Stirring Trouble.
[02:42:25.135 --> 02:42:27.977]  And I butcher his name, but it's Alexander Nekrasov.
[02:42:28.217 --> 02:42:28.978]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:29.098 --> 02:42:33.040]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:34.381]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:42:37.301 --> 02:42:40.803]  There's only three days left for the Mega Sale.
[02:42:41.203 --> 02:42:43.324]  67% off at infowarrestore.com.
[02:42:43.444 --> 02:42:45.465]  And don't forget, free shipping storewide.
[02:42:45.525 --> 02:42:47.086]  That all ends in just three days.
[02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:58.172]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[02:42:58.212 --> 02:43:15.381]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really severe.
[02:43:15.861 --> 02:43:16.502]  But is it true?
[02:43:17.422 --> 02:43:23.929]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:28.514]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[02:43:29.415 --> 02:43:30.796]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[02:43:31.744 --> 02:43:34.845]  So the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[02:43:34.885 --> 02:43:39.886]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming live every day from 11 a.m.
[02:43:40.266 --> 02:43:40.707]  to 3 p.m.
[02:43:40.767 --> 02:43:41.707]  just on my show.
[02:43:41.927 --> 02:43:44.368]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[02:43:44.408 --> 02:43:44.748]  Central.
[02:43:45.208 --> 02:43:48.649]  You got Owen Schroeder, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:43:48.669 --> 02:43:49.249]  in the War Room.
[02:43:49.489 --> 02:43:51.470]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[02:43:51.490 --> 02:43:52.690]  They're trying to block that.
[02:43:53.598 --> 02:43:57.381]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:05.186]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[02:44:05.686 --> 02:44:08.208]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[02:44:09.008 --> 02:44:13.051]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers and not let us advertise online.
[02:44:13.651 --> 02:44:14.592]  Kick us off PayPal.
[02:44:14.672 --> 02:44:15.572]  Kick us off Facebook.
[02:44:15.632 --> 02:44:16.433]  Kick us off Twitter.
[02:44:16.453 --> 02:44:17.273]  Kick us off YouTube.
[02:44:17.334 --> 02:44:23.898]  And over a hundred other platforms now where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[02:44:24.478 --> 02:44:32.322]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding by contacting companies who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[02:44:32.582 --> 02:44:34.603]  That's because we are on target.
[02:44:34.663 --> 02:44:36.825]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[02:44:36.845 --> 02:44:38.746]  We're exposing their main operation.
[02:44:39.266 --> 02:44:40.867]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[02:44:41.287 --> 02:44:42.147]  That's why you've supported us.
[02:44:42.207 --> 02:44:48.291]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:44:49.512 --> 02:44:51.455]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[02:44:51.475 --> 02:45:01.729]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:03.151]  To hand-share those links.
[02:45:03.211 --> 02:45:04.814]  To text message people.
[02:45:05.154 --> 02:45:06.595]  Information you think is particularly important.
[02:45:07.256 --> 02:45:08.596]  To get around the censors.
[02:45:08.636 --> 02:45:09.957]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[02:45:10.478 --> 02:45:14.120]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.062]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[02:45:17.122 --> 02:45:25.828]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best-rated, best-selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[02:45:25.848 --> 02:45:29.030]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:45:29.290 --> 02:45:31.212]  They're all there at infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:31.252 --> 02:45:31.852]  Patriot apparel.
[02:45:32.532 --> 02:45:32.993]  It's all there.
[02:45:34.295 --> 02:45:46.742]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:45:46.862 --> 02:45:59.410]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[02:46:00.410 --> 02:46:03.351]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[02:46:03.751 --> 02:46:08.132]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[02:46:08.172 --> 02:46:15.014]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:15.414 --> 02:46:16.854]  Everybody loves Rainforest.
[02:46:16.874 --> 02:46:18.235]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[02:46:18.655 --> 02:46:18.995]  50% off.
[02:46:19.215 --> 02:46:20.815]  Everybody really loves our Coil Silver.
[02:46:21.035 --> 02:46:23.416]  Highest quality, 67% off, silver bullet.
[02:46:24.156 --> 02:46:30.498]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:30.518 --> 02:46:36.579]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:43.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:59.671 --> 02:47:04.193]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.854 --> 02:47:08.755]  Alexander Nick Rostov is our guest.
[02:47:08.915 --> 02:47:10.175]  He's a former Kremlin official.
[02:47:10.195 --> 02:47:11.836]  He's also a journalist.
[02:47:12.916 --> 02:47:16.198]  And more very respectfully, he goes all over British, UK, and European news.
[02:47:17.338 --> 02:47:23.601]  And I'm just fascinated because they claim there's all this Russian collusion.
[02:47:24.993 --> 02:47:36.056]  In the 2016 election, but Russia's a diverse country like the United States or any big industrial and cultural and economic and technical power.
[02:47:36.836 --> 02:47:40.777]  And most of the stuff there is like here, a bunch of leftist globalists running around foaming at the mouth.
[02:47:41.337 --> 02:47:43.357]  So they go, oh look, there's bots influencing the election.
[02:47:43.917 --> 02:47:45.278]  Even the Wall Street Journal admitted 80% of the bots.
[02:47:47.472 --> 02:47:58.296]  were bought by Democrats, because you can get around campaign laws and go to Russia or England, like Cambridge Analytica, or Canada, and you go and you buy the PR from countries that offer it.
[02:47:58.316 --> 02:48:00.816]  You're not getting it from the country, you're getting it from the company.
[02:48:01.257 --> 02:48:06.958]  Michael Moore went to demonstrations organized by Russian bots, by the Democrats, because they could get around the laws going there.
[02:48:08.299 --> 02:48:11.780]  It's just crazy, and I don't want to go down the Russia rabbit hole, because no one I know buys it.
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:14.281]  And they've now kind of moved on from it, but
[02:48:15.621 --> 02:48:21.283]  When Italy says, we don't want to be under the unelected EU and be flooded by North Africans, they say, oh, Russia did it.
[02:48:21.703 --> 02:48:25.305]  Or Austria says, we're pulling out of the UN treaty because they're flooding us with illegals.
[02:48:25.685 --> 02:48:26.565]  Oh, the Russians did it.
[02:48:27.346 --> 02:48:29.987]  You know, if somebody baked their child a cake, the Russians did it.
[02:48:31.087 --> 02:48:33.088]  People say, I don't have any success except for the Russians.
[02:48:33.148 --> 02:48:38.250]  It's really insulting to everybody out there, and it's pure bull.
[02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:47.592]  Our guest was not just saying this earlier, even The Guardian says, now Brexit really is threatening to tear the UK apart.
[02:48:48.272 --> 02:48:50.193]  Well, that's because that's what it does.
[02:48:50.933 --> 02:48:53.433]  So, we're in this position right now.
[02:48:53.774 --> 02:48:57.354]  Then they say Britain's Populist Party has an Infowars editor for a spokesman.
[02:48:57.374 --> 02:48:58.355]  Jewish leaders are worried.
[02:48:58.915 --> 02:49:02.076]  We have nothing to do with putting down anybody for their ethnicity or religion.
[02:49:02.596 --> 02:49:07.417]  So, this is the weaponization they've got, trying to stop us supporting
[02:49:08.399 --> 02:49:10.219]  The UK and sovereignty existing.
[02:49:10.759 --> 02:49:13.480]  And so if Putin is involved in any conspiracy, it's this.
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:17.421]  It's a public conspiracy of leadership.
[02:49:17.581 --> 02:49:27.243]  And you know, I decided since I've been persecuted for supporting sovereign nations, especially sovereign nations that are promoting the family and Christianity, that I think Putin has done great things.
[02:49:27.323 --> 02:49:31.804]  And I admire the fact that he has gotten the Russians to have children again.
[02:49:31.824 --> 02:49:33.904]  And he's protected the nation from radical Islam.
[02:49:34.164 --> 02:49:35.864]  And then he's proud of their sovereignty.
[02:49:36.184 --> 02:49:36.965]  That's what we need.
[02:49:37.465 --> 02:49:39.685]  And Trump's been doing that too, and they say that's dirty.
[02:49:39.985 --> 02:49:40.205]  No!
[02:49:40.565 --> 02:49:48.147]  The people that tell you you're dirty if you have a country and a culture, they are called the enemy trying to demoralize you to stand down so they can take over.
[02:49:48.227 --> 02:49:53.628]  And the unelected EU and their drunken Nazi heir leader Juncker is an abomination!
[02:49:54.028 --> 02:50:00.290]  The man is basically the king of Luxembourg because his grandfather, the most powerful Nazi after Hitler,
[02:50:01.423 --> 02:50:03.104]  Literally took the country by force!
[02:50:03.144 --> 02:50:04.365]  These people are a joke!
[02:50:04.785 --> 02:50:15.591]  And now an unelected EU lets this drunk slap world leaders in the face, piss on himself, he wears the wrong color shoes, that's the latest video, and grabs women by the ass in public!
[02:50:15.611 --> 02:50:19.433]  I mean, we're ruled by this Botherias in a brown and black shoe.
[02:50:19.753 --> 02:50:20.193]  Back it up.
[02:50:20.233 --> 02:50:20.994]  They come and they tell him.
[02:50:22.313 --> 02:50:22.413]  He's
[02:50:44.047 --> 02:50:47.970]  President Rousifov, who's a great guy, will be coming in with all the news.
[02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.971]  He's been covering Joel Gilbert.
[02:50:49.271 --> 02:51:03.521]  But seriously, I mean, at this point here, I'm ranting, but to be called a Russian agent because I support sovereign nations existing is a load of crap by the very powers that are trying to get rid of our nations.
[02:51:03.961 --> 02:51:04.541]  I'm a traitor?
[02:51:05.526 --> 02:51:06.486]  Because I want the U.S.
[02:51:06.506 --> 02:51:07.387]  to be run by the U.S.?
[02:51:07.927 --> 02:51:10.108]  I'm a traitor because I want Russia to be run by Russians?
[02:51:10.428 --> 02:51:11.829]  I'm a traitor because I want the U.K.
[02:51:11.849 --> 02:51:12.729]  to be run by people there?
[02:51:13.049 --> 02:51:15.390]  I'm a traitor because I want EU states to be free?
[02:51:15.650 --> 02:51:16.250]  How is this?
[02:51:16.270 --> 02:51:20.212]  I know I'm ranting, Alexander.
[02:51:21.672 --> 02:51:22.193]  It's okay.
[02:51:22.973 --> 02:51:23.413]  It's okay.
[02:51:23.453 --> 02:51:30.476]  But, Alex, I think there are several important points we need to make about elections and how the left is
[02:51:31.686 --> 02:51:34.607]  Manipulate all sorts of things.
[02:51:34.667 --> 02:51:39.307]  First of all, you know they say the nation has become deeply divided.
[02:51:40.068 --> 02:51:45.649]  When Trump won the election, they said all the Americans are deeply divided because of Trump's win.
[02:51:46.209 --> 02:51:51.470]  When Brexit won in Britain, they said Britain is deeply divided because of Brexit.
[02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:53.550]  Well, let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:51:54.810 --> 02:51:56.871]  Every nation is divided by elections.
[02:51:57.311 --> 02:51:59.171]  You've got winners and you've got losers.
[02:51:59.895 --> 02:52:07.259]  Unfortunately, the losers, in this case, both with Trump and with Brexit, started to scream, we are divided.
[02:52:07.959 --> 02:52:08.879]  No, they're not divided.
[02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:15.743]  They have to accept that Trump has won the election and that Brexit won the referendum.
[02:52:16.183 --> 02:52:17.344]  But they're not accepting it.
[02:52:17.444 --> 02:52:20.025]  Then secondly, they say it's populism.
[02:52:20.572 --> 02:52:21.392]  It's populism.
[02:52:21.792 --> 02:52:22.913]  Trump is a populist.
[02:52:23.393 --> 02:52:24.553]  Putin is a populist.
[02:52:25.013 --> 02:52:26.214]  Brexit is populism.
[02:52:26.694 --> 02:52:28.994]  It's got nothing to do with populism.
[02:52:29.094 --> 02:52:32.275]  Populism is a left-wing method.
[02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:40.517]  I will remind everyone that populism initiated, originated during the French Revolution in the 18th century.
[02:52:41.618 --> 02:52:49.740]  Populism is when you offer things you can't deliver, and you don't want to deliver, and you don't intend to deliver.
[02:52:50.546 --> 02:52:56.189]  So the leftists have to stop calling right-wingers, conservatives, populists.
[02:52:56.229 --> 02:52:56.669]  They are not.
[02:52:57.350 --> 02:53:02.352]  Populism has always been a left-wing phenomenon.
[02:53:03.373 --> 02:53:09.076]  Populism is when you promise something you don't want to deliver or you're not planning to deliver.
[02:53:09.876 --> 02:53:13.898]  So there's two important points that are always mixing.
[02:53:14.399 --> 02:53:19.001]  And when it comes to the Russian involvement, meddling, in inverted commas,
[02:53:19.645 --> 02:53:32.356]  You see, what they're doing is that when they don't get the result they want, like it happened in America with Trump, like it happened with Brexit, they say that Russia is involved.
[02:53:33.017 --> 02:53:34.418]  They have no proof of that.
[02:53:35.138 --> 02:53:36.680]  They show no proof at all.
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:42.104]  They're standing... I want to talk about this, but what type of hairdryer or dustbuster is that in the background?
[02:53:44.486 --> 02:53:44.747]  Sorry?
[02:53:45.785 --> 02:53:46.866]  It may be a background noise.
[02:53:46.926 --> 02:53:48.647]  It sounds like a vacuum cleaner in the background.
[02:53:49.168 --> 02:53:50.689]  We're having a little fun here, but let's get serious.
[02:53:51.170 --> 02:53:52.190]  There's different definitions.
[02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:56.174]  There's kind of globalist populism, where they create a fake populism and promise things.
[02:53:56.494 --> 02:53:59.397]  Then there's a nationalism, which some would call a populism.
[02:53:59.637 --> 02:54:00.658]  But all I'm saying is...
[02:54:01.258 --> 02:54:08.705]  Interchangeably, there's people that are for a nation-state and a social compact who believe in a culture and an ideal and have a shared background and destiny.
[02:54:09.246 --> 02:54:18.735]  And the globalists are at war with that, and I'm simply saying Russia's the first country in the modern era of, I'd say, the last 25 years or so, at least since the turn of the century,
[02:54:19.355 --> 02:54:25.320]  On the 21st century to say, no, we're not going to be run by foreign multinational powers that are looting us.
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:35.389]  So the only real U.S.-Russia collusion I see is that Trump admired the fact that Putin could kick out foreign controllers and start to restore some prosperity to the country.
[02:54:36.189 --> 02:54:38.491]  And so I'm saying the only real collusion is there.
[02:54:38.792 --> 02:54:43.035]  And I think Putin's even said they did prefer Trump, but they never really explained why that is.
[02:54:43.055 --> 02:54:43.696]  Can you speak to that?
[02:54:45.874 --> 02:54:50.176]  Well, first of all, nobody actually knew that Trump would win.
[02:54:50.917 --> 02:54:54.319]  Now, I definitely can tell you that nobody in the Kremlin knew.
[02:54:54.919 --> 02:55:04.924]  And if you remember the polls that were showing in America that Trump had a 7% chance and Hillary had 93% chance.
[02:55:05.445 --> 02:55:10.867]  How do you think in Russia they could have thought that Trump would win?
[02:55:10.927 --> 02:55:11.828]  It was a surprise.
[02:55:12.532 --> 02:55:20.200]  Now, the reason why Russians wanted Trump to win is because he said that America should be friendly with Russia.
[02:55:20.721 --> 02:55:22.262]  Now, what's wrong with that?
[02:55:22.843 --> 02:55:31.492]  And what's wrong with the Russian people saying, yeah, we'd like that guy, we don't want Hillary, who was making Russia into an enemy?
[02:55:31.913 --> 02:55:33.034]  Now, the problem is this.
[02:55:33.672 --> 02:55:43.239]  The reason why Western governments are so aggressive against Russia is that Russia is technically the only conservative country left in Europe.
[02:55:43.899 --> 02:55:44.840]  Show me another one.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:47.262]  Britain is run by liberals.
[02:55:47.662 --> 02:55:48.823]  They're all neoliberals.
[02:55:48.883 --> 02:55:50.564]  They're even not hiding this.
[02:55:50.584 --> 02:55:54.687]  They're openly saying, we are social liberals.
[02:55:55.147 --> 02:55:56.228]  They're not conservatives.
[02:55:56.744 --> 02:56:08.673]  So if you look at any country across Europe, you would see, apart probably from Poland and Hungary, all the other Western countries in Europe are run by liberals.
[02:56:09.253 --> 02:56:13.396]  And liberals hate Russia because Russia sticks to conservative values.
[02:56:13.937 --> 02:56:23.764]  And that is why we have this new, very strange Cold War, which is more of an information war rather than a Cold War.
[02:56:24.184 --> 02:56:29.428]  And that's why your title, Infowars, is very, very, you know, important now.
[02:56:29.788 --> 02:56:37.873]  Because we have Infowars going on now between the liberals in the West, Russia, and the rest of the world.
[02:56:38.273 --> 02:56:39.634]  Well, I want to ask you this when we come back.
[02:56:39.654 --> 02:56:41.676]  I want to ask you to do one more segment.
[02:56:42.456 --> 02:56:43.457]  And I was just joking around earlier.
[02:56:43.477 --> 02:56:46.160]  I think you have an internal fan on your computer, but it's no big deal.
[02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:47.601]  You're joining us live from the UK.
[02:56:48.122 --> 02:56:53.947]  When we come back, I want to ask you, gut level, where do you see this going with the EU saying, OK, we'll give you Brexit.
[02:56:54.327 --> 02:56:56.129]  We'll just totally take control of your country.
[02:56:56.429 --> 02:56:59.772]  And they're forming an EU army to openly suppress states.
[02:57:00.393 --> 02:57:02.895]  And Macron says we need a military to fight the US.
[02:57:04.133 --> 02:57:08.335]  And Trump made the point, you know, if it wasn't for the US and Russia for that matter, you'd be speaking German.
[02:57:08.755 --> 02:57:10.055]  It's pretty amazing.
[02:57:10.576 --> 02:57:18.599]  And like you said, Hollywood hates Russia because Russia will not teach five-year-old boys how to, you know, give other men fellatio.
[02:57:18.619 --> 02:57:21.180]  I mean, it really comes down to that and to dress like little girls.
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:25.342]  They want Putin to put Russian boys in dresses and teach him how to do that.
[02:57:25.362 --> 02:57:27.102]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:27.803 --> 02:57:33.025]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[02:57:35.262 --> 02:57:36.823]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[02:57:36.863 --> 02:57:37.464]  It's a good thing.
[02:57:37.504 --> 02:57:40.706]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[02:57:41.266 --> 02:57:43.608]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[02:57:43.648 --> 02:57:44.789]  I learned what the best was.
[02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:58.739]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[02:57:59.219 --> 02:58:04.183]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[02:58:04.363 --> 02:58:08.829]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[02:58:09.309 --> 02:58:11.672]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[02:58:12.353 --> 02:58:16.739]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[02:58:18.408 --> 02:58:20.109]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:23.152]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[02:58:23.172 --> 02:58:30.577]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[02:58:30.597 --> 02:58:33.019]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[02:58:33.139 --> 02:58:36.081]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[02:58:36.202 --> 02:58:37.062]  Texas has that too.
[02:58:37.543 --> 02:58:41.325]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[02:58:41.886 --> 02:58:44.708]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[02:58:47.230 --> 02:58:51.216]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[02:58:51.597 --> 02:58:53.680]  We normally sell for $249 and it's a great deal.
[02:58:54.281 --> 02:58:57.566]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[02:58:57.786 --> 02:58:58.106]  It's $127.
[02:58:58.828 --> 02:59:02.613]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[02:59:03.442 --> 02:59:04.622]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[02:59:04.682 --> 02:59:06.763]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[02:59:06.803 --> 02:59:07.784]  I mean, I'm all for a great deal.
[02:59:07.944 --> 02:59:09.004]  This is insane.
[02:59:09.344 --> 02:59:11.105]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[02:59:11.545 --> 02:59:14.906]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family, get the best, the best deal.
[02:59:15.307 --> 02:59:17.507]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[02:59:17.607 --> 02:59:18.128]  It's amazing.
[02:59:18.208 --> 02:59:23.950]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:31.613 --> 02:59:32.636]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:00.243 --> 03:00:02.826]  Alexander Nikrasov is our guest for five more minutes.
[03:00:02.846 --> 03:00:04.307]  I appreciate him joining us.
[03:00:04.327 --> 03:00:05.568]  We've had a good discussion today.
[03:00:06.889 --> 03:00:15.717]  This is just horrifying that Theresa May tried to keep the text of this secret until the 11th hour and we get it and it just is such a flabbergasting power grab.
[03:00:15.737 --> 03:00:19.221]  And then you look at Juncker, if you're a radio listener, I showed the video.
[03:00:20.117 --> 03:00:24.121]  Wearing, on the podium, a brown shoe and a black shoe, can hardly talk.
[03:00:24.742 --> 03:00:29.027]  Shots of him slapping men in the face, grabbing women by the rear end, stumbling around.
[03:00:30.828 --> 03:00:36.575]  And the guy is just a super evil dude, and he just gets to do whatever he wants.
[03:00:36.595 --> 03:00:37.656]  And it's like, really?
[03:00:38.016 --> 03:00:40.118]  The heir to the Nazis stumbling around?
[03:00:41.723 --> 03:00:43.483]  And he's unelected and he rules everything.
[03:00:43.543 --> 03:00:50.245]  And then he said when Trump got elected at Davos with the Chai Com leader, he goes, we will crush America in a statement.
[03:00:50.285 --> 03:00:54.525]  He said, we will, I mean, it's like, and then, and then I'm the enemy and this is the good guy.
[03:00:54.645 --> 03:00:56.946]  I'm the traitor because I don't want nuclear war with Russia.
[03:00:57.286 --> 03:01:00.086]  And if Russia was involved in our business, like China, I'd be against Russia.
[03:01:00.287 --> 03:01:01.147]  It's just not going on.
[03:01:01.227 --> 03:01:07.988]  So Alexander, finishing up here with other tidbits, where do you see this whole Brexit scam going?
[03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:16.814]  Well, Alex, the problem is, of course, that the EU is basically a sinking ship.
[03:01:19.415 --> 03:01:31.922]  Not much is said about this, but the EU has a very, very, I would call it semi-illegal quantitative easing program when it pumps
[03:01:32.657 --> 03:01:42.086]  Up to 80 billion, 80 billion a month of newly created electronic money into its markets to keep them afloat.
[03:01:42.806 --> 03:01:49.032]  If this program would have stopped, this program is by the European Central Bank, but basically it's a German bank.
[03:01:49.933 --> 03:01:52.595]  Germany runs the European Central Bank.
[03:01:53.096 --> 03:01:58.260]  Oh, and Germany came up with the EU plan under, who was the guy's name, Adolf Hitler?
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:01:58.941]  Oh, sorry.
[03:02:00.993 --> 03:02:04.617]  Well, all sorts of nasty dictators came up with the EU plan.
[03:02:04.677 --> 03:02:08.320]  Lenin, Vladimir Lenin, wanted the United States of Europe.
[03:02:08.781 --> 03:02:10.602]  Napoleon wanted the same thing.
[03:02:11.063 --> 03:02:16.008]  Hitler wanted the United States of Europe, sorry, the United Europe, Federal Europe.
[03:02:16.388 --> 03:02:17.389]  But the point is this.
[03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:21.473]  The European Union is a sinking ship.
[03:02:22.375 --> 03:02:31.825]  Britain does not benefit from being part of the European Union simply because Britain is damaged economically by the European Union.
[03:02:32.305 --> 03:02:33.927]  I can tell you that the negative
[03:02:34.508 --> 03:02:41.372]  Trade deficit between Britain and Europe is 40 billion pounds each year.
[03:02:41.873 --> 03:02:46.356]  And you know what it means, 40 billion pounds of a negative trade deficit.
[03:02:46.816 --> 03:02:52.900]  It means that millions of jobs are destroyed in Britain by the European Union.
[03:02:53.180 --> 03:02:54.041]  That's what it means.
[03:02:54.581 --> 03:03:02.386]  And yet, people who want to stop Brexit or destroy Brexit are saying that they want to protect British jobs.
[03:03:03.095 --> 03:03:05.777]  They say that Brexit threatens Britain's jobs.
[03:03:06.338 --> 03:03:11.182]  They say Brexit threatens workers' rights, which is rubbish.
[03:03:12.062 --> 03:03:15.966]  Britain is damaged by the European Union.
[03:03:16.066 --> 03:03:23.912]  And guess why people are now realizing slowly that Theresa May never wanted a proper Brexit?
[03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:30.798]  Because Theresa May has managed to spoil relations with the Trump administration, which is unique in itself.
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:41.225]  And she managed to spoil relations with Russia, which is a key partner of Britain if it really wanted to leave the EU.
[03:03:41.785 --> 03:03:46.007]  Russia would have provided a huge market for British goods.
[03:03:46.528 --> 03:03:52.571]  But Theresa May and her government, they created this semi-war with Russia.
[03:03:53.111 --> 03:03:58.894]  They blame Russia for practically everything that's going wrong in Britain.
[03:03:59.614 --> 03:04:00.794]  And here's the final point.
[03:04:00.894 --> 03:04:05.176]  Russia is not bringing in massive hordes of radical Islamists to replace the population.
[03:04:05.496 --> 03:04:06.576]  The EU is.
[03:04:06.996 --> 03:04:09.597]  Russia is now allowing white South Africans and others to flee there.
[03:04:09.877 --> 03:04:11.077]  And this is not all race-based.
[03:04:11.117 --> 03:04:12.158]  It's religious-based, too.
[03:04:12.578 --> 03:04:14.278]  The left is using racial attacks.
[03:04:14.338 --> 03:04:23.861]  That's what's forcing more of the West to get into the ethno-state mindset, because the left and the cultural Marxists have put us in that position.
[03:04:24.461 --> 03:04:28.624]  At Stirring Trouble on Twitter, Alexander Nekrasov has been our guest.
[03:04:28.944 --> 03:04:31.445]  Come back soon and we look forward to speaking to you.
[03:04:31.465 --> 03:04:31.806]  Thank you.
[03:04:32.106 --> 03:04:33.907]  We'll be right back with Joel Gilbert.
[03:04:33.947 --> 03:04:34.887]  I'll be speaking to him as well.
[03:04:34.947 --> 03:04:35.488]  Stay with us.
[03:04:42.852 --> 03:04:47.975]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez and if you're always on the go like me then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[03:04:48.336 --> 03:04:50.417]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[03:04:52.398 --> 03:05:01.381]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:01.741 --> 03:05:07.964]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[03:05:08.464 --> 03:05:13.285]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[03:05:13.706 --> 03:05:14.626]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:05:15.046 --> 03:05:17.127]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[03:05:17.488 --> 03:05:19.249]  Apple banned your app.
[03:05:19.549 --> 03:05:21.430]  I help, too!
[03:05:21.530 --> 03:05:23.131]  Oh, Oliver.
[03:05:23.311 --> 03:05:29.235]  I hate free speech, too!
[03:05:29.275 --> 03:05:32.677]  We hate free speech!
[03:05:32.857 --> 03:05:34.478]  We hate free speech!
[03:05:34.558 --> 03:05:36.279]  We hate free speech!
[03:05:36.399 --> 03:05:38.100]  We hate free speech!
[03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:40.982]  We are drugged out!
[03:05:41.662 --> 03:05:43.904]  We are following other people's opinions!
[03:05:45.029 --> 03:05:47.311]  We are controlled by the media.
[03:05:47.851 --> 03:05:49.432]  Today it all changes.
[03:05:49.733 --> 03:05:52.195]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[03:05:52.475 --> 03:05:55.337]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[03:05:55.537 --> 03:06:00.061]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[03:06:00.301 --> 03:06:02.923]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[03:06:02.963 --> 03:06:05.465]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[03:06:05.805 --> 03:06:07.746]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:06:08.247 --> 03:06:09.668]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:06:09.888 --> 03:06:11.049]  We have the resources.
[03:06:14.107 --> 03:06:17.770]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:19.231]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[03:06:19.411 --> 03:06:20.992]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[03:06:21.032 --> 03:06:21.913]  They say Trump's crazy.
[03:06:22.113 --> 03:06:23.014]  They say I'm crazy.
[03:06:23.194 --> 03:06:25.396]  But I'm here to show love.
[03:06:25.576 --> 03:06:29.259]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:34.283]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:34.863 --> 03:06:36.645]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:51.566 --> 03:06:56.308]  All right, Joel Gilbert's taking over here in just a few minutes, and he's always got guests and a big show lined up for you when he hosts.
[03:06:56.788 --> 03:07:00.550]  On Fridays in the War Room, comes up at 3 o'clock, the one Troy or Roger Stone and others.
[03:07:01.450 --> 03:07:07.473]  But I want to know, Joel Gilbert looks into Russia and communism and the rest of it, and I think China's the big threat.
[03:07:08.493 --> 03:07:15.016]  There was no real evidence of Russian meddling on behalf of Trump that was evidence of it going on for Hillary.
[03:07:17.822 --> 03:07:22.746]  But then I have people on like Alexander Nekrasov, who formerly worked for the Kremlin as a journalist.
[03:07:24.647 --> 03:07:29.711]  And I see Russia becoming Christian.
[03:07:30.111 --> 03:07:31.953]  I see it standing up against radical Islam.
[03:07:32.953 --> 03:07:35.896]  I see Trump attracted to the idea of business with Russia.
[03:07:36.676 --> 03:07:42.501]  Russia controls so much of the land space and borders with other nations that the only alliance
[03:07:43.903 --> 03:07:48.509]  against the criminal EU and the CHICOMS would be an alliance with Russia.
[03:07:48.549 --> 03:07:49.831]  But I know it's the traditional enemy.
[03:07:49.851 --> 03:07:58.121]  We've been taught to hate Russia and that's because the globalists and others, you know, helped, the proto-globalists and others left us worldwide, helped prop up the Soviet Union.
[03:07:58.561 --> 03:08:01.205]  And I understand they've still got their communists and all their issues over there.
[03:08:02.796 --> 03:08:03.297]  I don't know.
[03:08:18.132 --> 03:08:18.352]  I don't
[03:08:38.490 --> 03:08:39.330]  I mean, I was teasing earlier.
[03:08:39.370 --> 03:08:43.952]  I said, well, don't worry, we've got a former Kremlin guy on because we've got a Russophobe coming up to balance it out.
[03:08:44.192 --> 03:08:45.393]  And I don't mean that as a mean thing.
[03:08:45.433 --> 03:08:49.414]  I mean, that is a serious thing, because I'm definitely phobic of authoritarianism.
[03:08:49.895 --> 03:09:00.699]  I see Google moving into the former headquarters in Eastern Germany and East Berlin of the Stasi, not just companies like Facebook hiring.
[03:09:01.869 --> 03:09:06.074]  That's hiring former high-level Stasi to oppress people.
[03:09:06.114 --> 03:09:09.537]  So who needs Russia when you've got the globalists, the EU, and the Democratic Party?
[03:09:09.978 --> 03:09:16.365]  So what would you say the different power blocks are, Joel Gilbert, a filmmaker, a writer, in your view?
[03:09:19.128 --> 03:09:22.752]  Look, I think that first of all,
[03:09:24.278 --> 03:09:24.858]  Trump only lost
[03:09:39.437 --> 03:09:39.657]  You know,
[03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:06.142]  Russia was their friend, and they wanted an alliance with Russia when they were hardcore Marxist communists.
[03:10:06.202 --> 03:10:17.167]  Now that they've turned Christian and capitalist, they don't like them very much, and they're trying to malign them and put them in the same poor light as they are with Donald Trump.
[03:10:18.127 --> 03:10:21.648]  So, I think things are going to have to shake out over the next couple months.
[03:10:21.668 --> 03:10:25.670]  Let's see how this Brexit thing shakes out, if they can get rid of Theresa May.
[03:10:26.468 --> 03:10:29.672]  And let's see what Trump is going to do now that he's got the midterms behind him.
[03:10:30.092 --> 03:10:33.637]  I think by January, February, a lot of these questions will be answered.
[03:10:44.994 --> 03:10:45.995]  The Deep State and Mueller.
[03:10:46.456 --> 03:10:47.978]  All that, obviously, is front and center.
[03:10:48.018 --> 03:10:48.619]  I agree with you.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:58.512]  But ideologically, to me, I don't assume we have the EU and the CHICOMS and others openly allied with the left, with Hollywood, openly meddling.
[03:10:59.682 --> 03:11:04.667]  We need to go on the offense, Trump needs to go on the offense about that, and say to Americans, do you understand?
[03:11:05.388 --> 03:11:10.133]  UN-funded caravans, CHICOM funding of all this, side with America, idiots!
[03:11:10.573 --> 03:11:15.759]  And I understand with the left, they say America was never great, they hate nationalism, they're making a dirty word.
[03:11:15.799 --> 03:11:19.543]  I guess, just for me, to wrap my mind around,
[03:11:20.839 --> 03:11:31.624]  The fact that we aren't voting 90% for Republicans who are patriots, when the other side is openly allergic to America, it just seems like a no-brainer.
[03:11:31.644 --> 03:11:47.652]  And that just shows how far we've slid, that we have the real realization, Joel, that most Democrats now really have drunk the Kool-Aid, and really hate the country, and really hate capitalism, and really just don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.
[03:11:48.993 --> 03:11:49.734]  Yeah, they are.
[03:11:50.895 --> 03:11:53.117]  Look, with Obama, it was stealth socialism.
[03:11:53.177 --> 03:11:54.338]  He ran as a moderate.
[03:11:54.358 --> 03:11:56.080]  He said, I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:57.561]  I'll obey the Constitution.
[03:11:58.302 --> 03:12:00.224]  Marriage is between man and a woman and God.
[03:12:00.684 --> 03:12:01.305]  It was hidden.
[03:12:01.365 --> 03:12:06.229]  As soon as he took power, of course, he threw everyone under the bus and pursued this radical agenda.
[03:12:06.670 --> 03:12:09.713]  Now the Democrats are openly selling an alternate reality.
[03:12:10.073 --> 03:12:12.215]  This is what socialism and communism is.
[03:12:12.275 --> 03:12:12.816]  This is what
[03:12:13.886 --> 03:12:24.937]  Nazism was, where Venezuela, where you say the government is going to take control of everything, your property, your businesses, and everything's going to work out great for you, just give us the power.
[03:12:25.457 --> 03:12:28.600]  And this alternate reality always fails miserably.
[03:12:29.201 --> 03:12:31.843]  But people are buying into it, just like they did with Obama.
[03:12:31.863 --> 03:12:35.767]  They just clap and cheer, even though they have no idea what he's talking about.
[03:12:36.667 --> 03:12:40.029]  Stacey Abrams, you know, Gillum in Florida.
[03:12:40.449 --> 03:12:42.310]  Open radicals, lost by less than 1%.
[03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:48.393]  That's just one month of organizing and signing up people for registering illegals.
[03:12:48.433 --> 03:12:53.975]  Hey, Tito O'Rourke, excuse me, Beto O'Rourke, he only lost by like two points.
[03:12:54.396 --> 03:12:59.758]  Obviously it was massive fraud, but folks, we can look at France and make fun of them, or California and make fun of them, or New York or Chicago.
[03:13:00.038 --> 03:13:05.101]  Texas has almost brought in somebody that says he hates capitalism and he hates America.
[03:13:06.778 --> 03:13:13.603]  Well, I've got, coming on later on the show, I'm going to interview a gentleman who wrote an article called, uh, is Trump the last Republican president?
[03:13:13.703 --> 03:13:19.888]  Because if they flip Florida and Texas, uh, it's going to be very difficult for a Republican president to win.
[03:13:20.268 --> 03:13:26.413]  And we know that the Democrats, once they take power, will use the tools of state to keep power permanent.
[03:13:26.433 --> 03:13:26.813]  Exactly.
[03:13:27.014 --> 03:13:35.160]  And we'll, we'll turn just like Canada, Sweden, France, Britain, Germany, Venezuela, permanent socialist state, uh, where they,
[03:13:35.925 --> 03:13:39.428]  Break down nationalism for this globalist socialist agenda.
[03:13:39.828 --> 03:13:46.334]  And we lived it for eight years under Obama with a stagnant economy, food stamps, illegals, illegal activity by the government.
[03:13:46.354 --> 03:13:48.316]  He was trying to wreck it the whole time.
[03:13:48.656 --> 03:13:51.719]  But, exactly, I just can't believe people aren't supporting Trump more.
[03:13:52.059 --> 03:13:58.905]  I believe the Republicans really won the midterms, but letting them censor and letting them election meddle and letting them steal in many areas, that's why we lost.
[03:13:59.205 --> 03:14:00.246]  So we gotta take the gloves off.
[03:14:00.286 --> 03:14:02.128]  Joel, you're coming back on the other side to take over.
[03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:03.921]  The next 45 minutes.
[03:14:04.321 --> 03:14:08.486]  Please, listeners, please do not forget that without you supporting us, we're not here.
[03:14:08.847 --> 03:14:11.810]  And that means sharing the articles, sharing the videos.
[03:14:11.850 --> 03:14:15.355]  That means telling friends and family about local radio stations, local TV stations.
[03:14:15.995 --> 03:14:17.838]  You are the way we're able to stand up.
[03:14:17.878 --> 03:14:20.641]  They don't want us on air during this attempted globalist takeover.
[03:14:20.681 --> 03:14:22.103]  But look, nationalists are getting elected everywhere.
[03:14:23.860 --> 03:14:26.101]  We could turn this around very, very quickly, but it's critical.
[03:14:26.161 --> 03:14:27.501]  Infowars continue on.
[03:14:27.661 --> 03:14:28.982]  I know you know all about the globalists.
[03:14:29.522 --> 03:14:32.743]  Your neighbors, your friends, your family, your co-workers, your church members.
[03:14:32.823 --> 03:14:35.684]  I don't care if you're a non-radical Muslim that wants to live in America.
[03:14:35.704 --> 03:14:35.884]  Great.
[03:14:35.924 --> 03:14:36.665]  Tell your imam.
[03:14:37.845 --> 03:14:38.185]  Whatever.
[03:14:38.705 --> 03:14:40.226]  The point is, get involved.
[03:14:40.366 --> 03:14:41.106]  Spread the word.
[03:14:41.446 --> 03:14:42.307]  This is do or die.
[03:14:42.327 --> 03:14:43.667]  People can see how clear this is.
[03:14:44.107 --> 03:14:46.048]  And financially, we make it so easy to support us.
[03:14:46.668 --> 03:14:48.189]  We've got huge sales going right now.
[03:14:49.622 --> 03:14:50.403]  We're good to go!
[03:14:50.423 --> 03:14:51.504]  We're good to go!
[03:14:51.524 --> 03:14:52.004]  We're good to go!
[03:14:52.024 --> 03:14:52.744]  We're good to go!
[03:15:16.423 --> 03:15:17.044]  Or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:17.064 --> 03:15:25.013]  So whether it's InfoWars hoodies or whether it's RainForce Plus, the Amazing Utropic, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:25.414 --> 03:15:35.145]  Okay, Joel Gilbert, filmmaker, author, researcher, is going to come back with the inside take on what needs to happen to keep America free and not under global control.
[03:15:37.332 --> 03:15:40.840]  There's only three days left for the Mega Sale.
[03:15:41.241 --> 03:15:43.386]  67% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:15:43.486 --> 03:15:45.511]  And don't forget, free shipping storewide.
[03:15:45.571 --> 03:15:47.134]  That all ends in just three days.
[03:15:53.621 --> 03:15:58.403]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[03:15:58.423 --> 03:16:15.412]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[03:16:15.892 --> 03:16:16.533]  But is it true?
[03:16:17.453 --> 03:16:23.962]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[03:16:24.944 --> 03:16:28.508]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[03:16:29.450 --> 03:16:30.812]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[03:16:31.772 --> 03:16:34.875]  So the establishment wants us off the air at any cost.
[03:16:34.915 --> 03:16:37.497]  Because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[03:16:37.857 --> 03:16:39.939]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[03:16:40.259 --> 03:16:40.739]  to 3 p.m.
[03:16:40.799 --> 03:16:41.520]  just on my show.
[03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:44.422]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[03:16:44.462 --> 03:16:44.782]  Central.
[03:16:45.223 --> 03:16:48.666]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:16:48.686 --> 03:16:49.286]  in the War Room.
[03:16:49.526 --> 03:16:51.528]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[03:16:51.548 --> 03:16:52.749]  They're trying to block that.
[03:16:53.632 --> 03:16:57.415]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[03:16:58.076 --> 03:17:05.182]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[03:17:05.722 --> 03:17:08.244]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[03:17:09.045 --> 03:17:13.250]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online.
[03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:17.294]  Kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube.
[03:17:17.354 --> 03:17:23.921]  And over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[03:17:24.501 --> 03:17:32.569]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[03:17:32.609 --> 03:17:34.651]  That's because we are on target.
[03:17:34.711 --> 03:17:36.853]  We're exposing the globalist paradigm.
[03:17:36.893 --> 03:17:38.795]  We're exposing their main operation.
[03:17:39.316 --> 03:17:40.897]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[03:17:41.338 --> 03:17:42.959]  That's why you've supported us.
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:48.304]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:17:49.546 --> 03:17:51.489]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[03:17:51.509 --> 03:18:04.849]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever, to hand-share those links, to text message people.
[03:18:05.189 --> 03:18:06.590]  Information you think is particularly important.
[03:18:07.271 --> 03:18:08.612]  To get around the censors.
[03:18:08.652 --> 03:18:09.973]  Nothing can stop the word of mouth.
[03:18:10.493 --> 03:18:14.196]  And yes, to financially support InfoWars.
[03:18:14.276 --> 03:18:16.658]  And we make it easy to support InfoWars.
[03:18:17.158 --> 03:18:25.864]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best-rated, best-selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[03:18:25.884 --> 03:18:29.047]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[03:18:29.067 --> 03:18:31.248]  They're all there at infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:31.288 --> 03:18:31.889]  Patriot apparel.
[03:18:32.549 --> 03:18:33.050]  It's all there.
[03:18:34.332 --> 03:18:46.703]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:46.824 --> 03:18:59.355]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself where we can't even sell products.
[03:19:00.356 --> 03:19:03.297]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[03:19:03.717 --> 03:19:08.098]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you these specials.
[03:19:08.138 --> 03:19:15.000]  So please take advantage of them today at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:16.800]  Everybody loves Brain Force.
[03:19:16.820 --> 03:19:18.621]  If you haven't tried it, get some.
[03:19:18.641 --> 03:19:18.941]  30% off.
[03:19:19.181 --> 03:19:20.801]  Everybody really loves our Coil Silver.
[03:19:21.001 --> 03:19:22.062]  Highest quality, 67% off.
[03:19:22.102 --> 03:19:22.622]  Silver Bullet.
[03:19:24.102 --> 03:19:30.468]  We've got so many other great products at Survival Shield X3, 50% off and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:30.488 --> 03:19:36.553]  Thanks for sharing with InfoWars and thanks for taking care of yourself and your family at the same time by getting these great products a true 360 win.
[03:19:40.797 --> 03:19:43.459]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:00.820 --> 03:20:02.982]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:03.422 --> 03:20:05.084]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.104 --> 03:20:08.608]  And now, your host, Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:11.229 --> 03:20:13.010]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:20.313]  I'm Joel Gilbert, guest hosting this hour, coming from the People's Republic of California, or what's left of it that hasn't burned down.
[03:20:21.493 --> 03:20:25.095]  Thank you to all the people who contacted me on Twitter and by email.
[03:20:25.115 --> 03:20:26.435]  2 a.m.
[03:20:26.755 --> 03:20:28.316]  I'm here in Thousand Oaks, California.
[03:20:28.416 --> 03:20:30.137]  I get a text to evacuate.
[03:20:30.157 --> 03:20:32.638]  Go ahead and put up those couple of photos.
[03:20:32.678 --> 03:20:35.139]  You can see that was the view from my
[03:20:36.099 --> 03:20:37.400]  We're good to go.
[03:20:54.406 --> 03:21:06.552]  The wrath of God spared a conservative filmmaker and sought out other targets, unfortunately, over in Malibu.
[03:21:06.592 --> 03:21:08.073]  That was very tragic.
[03:21:08.093 --> 03:21:08.913]  We're still recovering.
[03:21:09.814 --> 03:21:11.855]  But I want to thank everybody who contacted me.
[03:21:12.575 --> 03:21:13.656]  A lot to cover today.
[03:21:14.616 --> 03:21:16.597]  First of all, I want to comment on the Mueller probe.
[03:21:17.038 --> 03:21:18.679]  It is expanding and not ending.
[03:21:19.239 --> 03:21:23.321]  If you can put up that link, it seems to me the endless investigation of everything
[03:21:24.312 --> 03:21:24.752]  We're good to go.
[03:21:47.802 --> 03:21:50.444]  Two, three, four years down the road, it's going to be old news.
[03:21:50.724 --> 03:21:52.645]  You know, no one wants to bother.
[03:21:53.066 --> 03:21:55.547]  That's the same thing that happened with the IRS interference.
[03:21:55.647 --> 03:22:04.553]  The Democrats used the IRS to interfere in the 2012 election to prevent Republicans from organizing by decimating the Tea Party groups.
[03:22:05.154 --> 03:22:06.835]  No one remembers or even talks about it.
[03:22:06.875 --> 03:22:16.782]  So, I think that's what the Mueller investigation is attempting to achieve, is keep the damn thing going, run out the clock, and all the Spygate guys go free.
[03:22:18.271 --> 03:22:19.812]  Alright, midterm elections.
[03:22:19.852 --> 03:22:21.454]  Did the Republicans win or lose?
[03:22:22.394 --> 03:22:30.421]  The most shocking and alarming thing to me is that several Democrats running as open radicals lost by less than 1%.
[03:22:30.461 --> 03:22:38.067]  Andrew Gillum in Florida, put his picture up there, and of course there he is, nice guy, looks like a nice guy, friendly guy.
[03:22:38.527 --> 03:22:39.928]  Beto O'Rourke in Texas.
[03:22:41.469 --> 03:22:42.350]  Stacey Abrams.
[03:22:42.910 --> 03:22:47.414]  Even one, one of them won, which was Code Pink's Kirsten Sinema in Arizona.
[03:22:48.078 --> 03:22:52.742]  So this is a shocking result, I think, for Republicans.
[03:22:52.842 --> 03:22:59.107]  And we're going to have coming on the air in a few minutes a writer named Brian Jundeff from Denver.
[03:22:59.127 --> 03:23:04.352]  He's a physician and he wrote on American Thinker, Will Trump be the last American president?
[03:23:05.273 --> 03:23:07.675]  And there is definitely a new battlefield.
[03:23:08.795 --> 03:23:15.221]  The Democrats are controlling the emotions of women and minorities with baseless accusations.
[03:23:16.041 --> 03:23:18.522]  Promises of government services and higher taxes.
[03:23:19.062 --> 03:23:28.164]  Now you'd think that a promise of higher taxes would not work, but with half the people not paying taxes, raising taxes means you get more services.
[03:23:29.004 --> 03:23:31.525]  Now they don't tell you that that means you're going to lose your job.
[03:23:32.525 --> 03:23:39.047]  And that's the essence of the Democrat Party of Radical Socialism is they sell an alternate reality.
[03:23:39.987 --> 03:23:43.668]  With this alternate reality, most Western countries have flipped
[03:23:44.457 --> 03:23:49.098]  Permanently into the socialist and globalist world, not nationalist.
[03:23:49.138 --> 03:23:55.060]  That includes our allies, of course, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden.
[03:23:55.620 --> 03:23:58.701]  You have 50% taxes as much as 75%.
[03:23:59.401 --> 03:24:01.742]  Huge amount of immigration from third world countries.
[03:24:02.362 --> 03:24:04.603]  No rights to self-defense through gun ownership.
[03:24:05.243 --> 03:24:08.204]  Free speech is almost eliminated in Sweden.
[03:24:09.004 --> 03:24:10.884]  It's almost a totalitarian country.
[03:24:11.685 --> 03:24:13.065]  Terrible government health care.
[03:24:13.740 --> 03:24:21.424]  This is the future that the Democrats and the Radicals want to bring America into this future of these other Western countries that were unable to resist it.
[03:24:22.324 --> 03:24:29.768]  Trump is calling for nationalism, a re-energizing of our national goals of our Constitution.
[03:24:30.208 --> 03:24:38.592]  But the forces of the media, the money people, George Soros, and globalism have achieved only a 1%, less than 1% difference in these elections.
[03:24:43.464 --> 03:24:59.733]  The alternate reality of socialism, of course, is the idea that the government, you give the government all your property, give it your right to self-defense, give up your guns, and the government will control all the businesses, will break up all these businesses, and it'll be run by the government.
[03:25:00.734 --> 03:25:05.056]  And people have largely gone along with this without realizing how bad it is.
[03:25:06.157 --> 03:25:09.199]  I like to give the example of the Israeli left in Israel.
[03:25:09.239 --> 03:25:11.120]  The leftists sold an alternate reality
[03:25:11.974 --> 03:25:20.537]  Several years ago, 20 years ago, the Israeli left said, hey, let's bring these terrorists in to Israel.
[03:25:20.557 --> 03:25:21.337]  We'll give them land.
[03:25:21.397 --> 03:25:22.317]  We'll give them weapons.
[03:25:22.917 --> 03:25:26.238]  We'll give them a right to bear arms.
[03:25:26.818 --> 03:25:28.799]  And they brought the PLO into Israel.
[03:25:28.839 --> 03:25:30.339]  They set up a country for them.
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:33.400]  And the result was 30 years of war.
[03:25:33.500 --> 03:25:38.742]  Thousands of Israelis dead in the streets because the left sold an alternate reality.
[03:25:39.728 --> 03:25:48.792]  Let's take a quick look at this video of Bernie Sanders and Obama selling the alternate reality, and we'll have our guest after the break.
[03:25:49.072 --> 03:25:49.692]  Let's take a look.
[03:25:50.572 --> 03:26:04.618]  And here is a New Year's resolution that I will keep if elected president, and that is, if Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them.
[03:26:05.953 --> 03:26:13.100]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[03:26:13.900 --> 03:26:20.987]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:26:26.952 --> 03:26:29.074]  Not only will big banks
[03:26:30.100 --> 03:26:37.927]  Not be too big to fail, but big time bankers will not be too big to jail.
[03:26:39.569 --> 03:26:43.813]  Okay, so this is the alternate reality of Marxism and Socialism.
[03:26:44.689 --> 03:26:48.831]  Bernie Sanders wants to break up the banks, break up the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:26:49.371 --> 03:26:54.414]  The state bureaucrats take charge of healthcare, of all these American businesses.
[03:26:55.114 --> 03:27:01.677]  And we saw the result under Obama, a little part of it, economic stagnation, no growth, food stamps for 40 million people.
[03:27:02.555 --> 03:27:07.216]  The mob that you see on the streets chasing down Republicans did not come from nowhere.
[03:27:07.656 --> 03:27:10.037]  The mob was in control for eight years of Obama.
[03:27:10.077 --> 03:27:11.097]  They were the FBI.
[03:27:11.577 --> 03:27:14.598]  They were controlling the Environmental Protection Agency.
[03:27:15.058 --> 03:27:16.519]  They were abusing the IRS.
[03:27:16.599 --> 03:27:18.179]  They were abusing the FISA courts.
[03:27:18.699 --> 03:27:22.741]  So we've been talking about this for eight years almost now.
[03:27:23.421 --> 03:27:26.001]  The Republican establishment is finally waking up.
[03:27:26.061 --> 03:27:28.682]  Lindsey Graham suddenly became a conservative.
[03:27:28.942 --> 03:27:31.743]  Kevin McCarthy, even Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell.
[03:27:32.651 --> 03:27:35.213]  But they're coming around about eight years too late.
[03:27:35.273 --> 03:27:40.657]  We've been talking about this for such a long time that these are radicals and we have to fight them.
[03:27:41.577 --> 03:27:54.246]  Mitt Romney, someone brought him my movie, Dreams for My Real Father, when he was running against Obama and said, you got to call out this guy and explain that his father was a Russian spy and Obama is a total fraud.
[03:27:54.266 --> 03:27:57.028]  And Mitt Romney said, oh, people don't want to talk about that.
[03:27:57.068 --> 03:27:58.469]  They just want to hear about the economy.
[03:27:59.082 --> 03:28:04.852]  Well, the voters in Florida and Texas and Arizona didn't care about the tremendous success with the economy.
[03:28:04.892 --> 03:28:07.758]  They cared about electing radical socialists.
[03:28:08.855 --> 03:28:12.757]  Along with voter fraud, I think America is in grave danger.
[03:28:13.358 --> 03:28:16.099]  And they will not fool around if they get power again.
[03:28:16.139 --> 03:28:18.300]  They will make sure there is no fair election.
[03:28:19.041 --> 03:28:28.446]  After the break, coming up, a doctor who wrote the article for American Thinker called, Is Donald Trump the Last American President?
[03:28:28.966 --> 03:28:32.288]  We're going to talk about why this may be a reality after the break.
[03:28:40.208 --> 03:28:40.848]  All right, you rolling?
[03:28:43.449 --> 03:28:44.069]  What am I going to say?
[03:28:46.750 --> 03:29:00.895]  There is a corporate consortium of anti-free market monopoly men who have allied themselves with Communist China, the dictatorial EU, America hating Hollywood, and others who think Americans are a bunch of dumb chumps who they can walk in here and rob.
[03:29:00.915 --> 03:29:03.656]  But it was basic American free market liberty
[03:29:05.485 --> 03:29:07.227]  That produced all this incredible wealth.
[03:29:07.727 --> 03:29:17.635]  So we should stand up against globalism, not just for the wealth, but because the globalists are so incredibly oppressive and ally themselves with every horrible form of...
[03:29:20.521 --> 03:29:21.141]  Evil regime.
[03:29:21.642 --> 03:29:22.562]  Radical Islam.
[03:29:22.582 --> 03:29:24.003]  The Communist Chinese.
[03:29:24.083 --> 03:29:27.485]  The evil yonker of the EU.
[03:29:27.545 --> 03:29:28.806]  It's just crazy.
[03:29:29.366 --> 03:29:30.847]  Of course we can beat these people.
[03:29:31.268 --> 03:29:32.849]  Of course they can be stopped.
[03:29:33.009 --> 03:29:36.351]  But we have to stand against them and say no to their operation.
[03:29:36.811 --> 03:29:39.713]  I used to always wonder 30 years ago why we couldn't defeat the globalists.
[03:29:40.253 --> 03:29:43.114]  Then about 25 years ago, I got politically involved.
[03:29:43.334 --> 03:29:44.335]  23 years ago, I got on air.
[03:29:44.395 --> 03:29:45.075]  Then I learned why.
[03:29:45.095 --> 03:29:46.696]  Because you get fired.
[03:29:47.256 --> 03:29:48.517]  Because you get demonized.
[03:29:48.537 --> 03:29:49.557]  Because you get sued.
[03:29:49.657 --> 03:29:51.258]  Because you get physically assaulted.
[03:29:52.659 --> 03:29:54.580]  And the globalists are betting you're a bunch of cowards.
[03:29:55.160 --> 03:29:57.501]  And so you'll never stick your head up because you don't want that to happen.
[03:29:58.341 --> 03:30:04.024]  But instead, you have your whole birthright stolen, you become a slave, and you die a thousand deaths instead of one death.
[03:30:04.044 --> 03:30:07.306]  Well, I'd rather die that one death instead of a thousand, but we don't have to die.
[03:30:08.643 --> 03:30:10.625]  We've simply got to get engaged.
[03:30:10.785 --> 03:30:13.347]  They fear the InfoWars audience, because you're not a regular audience.
[03:30:13.407 --> 03:30:18.691]  You are men and women in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about in that beautiful speech.
[03:30:19.472 --> 03:30:22.234]  And that's why I know we're going to win.
[03:30:22.354 --> 03:30:29.420]  Because of you, every race, color, and creed who have red blood, who believe in liberty, I stand with you, you stand with me, and it's amazing.
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:31.581]  That's why we're launching another initiative.
[03:30:32.201 --> 03:30:36.724]  I know it got Trump's attention when I sent 100,000 letters to him a year and a half ago about internet censorship.
[03:30:37.224 --> 03:30:41.546]  We're going to send a million letters at WriteTrump.com.
[03:30:41.627 --> 03:30:43.067]  You can print it off yourself and mail it.
[03:30:43.908 --> 03:30:45.269]  That way, two letters go per person.
[03:30:45.309 --> 03:30:49.051]  But regardless, I'm going to mail it in an envelope to the White House.
[03:30:49.151 --> 03:30:52.513]  I want to send about 80% of whatever we get in.
[03:30:52.533 --> 03:30:53.873]  I hope it will be a million.
[03:30:53.893 --> 03:30:54.354]  That's up to you.
[03:30:55.680 --> 03:30:56.280]  To the White House.
[03:30:56.340 --> 03:30:57.782]  Another 100,000 to Mar-a-Lago.
[03:30:58.082 --> 03:30:59.323]  Another 100,000 to Trump Tower.
[03:30:59.603 --> 03:31:02.665]  So there's no way the President isn't knee-deep in these.
[03:31:02.745 --> 03:31:04.606]  And he pays attention to a letter.
[03:31:05.027 --> 03:31:06.968]  He sees that as like 10,000 emails.
[03:31:07.488 --> 03:31:08.389]  That you took action.
[03:31:08.409 --> 03:31:09.290]  That you got involved.
[03:31:09.390 --> 03:31:15.954]  Separately, when you sign up, we'll be able to send you alerts about the fight against censorship and against the globalists.
[03:31:15.994 --> 03:31:16.375]  So again,
[03:31:17.688 --> 03:31:18.689]  RightTrump.com.
[03:31:18.729 --> 03:31:21.290]  Go read the letter that Roger Stone and I have written to the President.
[03:31:21.350 --> 03:31:23.412]  You can add your own or just send it alone.
[03:31:23.912 --> 03:31:25.433]  Again, print it off, send it yourself.
[03:31:25.553 --> 03:31:26.754]  We're going to send it regardless.
[03:31:27.094 --> 03:31:27.674]  It's so easy.
[03:31:27.714 --> 03:31:28.715]  Go spend two minutes.
[03:31:29.215 --> 03:31:29.935]  Go to RightTrump.com.
[03:31:31.326 --> 03:31:32.286]  Sign it, send a letter.
[03:31:32.526 --> 03:31:33.847]  It'll be legitimately from you.
[03:31:34.127 --> 03:31:39.728]  Hopefully you add something to it so that it'll be a two-page letter, not just our letter, and this will have a big effect.
[03:31:40.168 --> 03:31:42.128]  And regardless, it gets the globalist attention.
[03:31:42.408 --> 03:31:43.269]  So we're not laying down.
[03:31:43.289 --> 03:31:46.409]  We're not just curling up in a ball in the fetal position and taking all this crap.
[03:31:46.769 --> 03:31:49.450]  Trump has said he's getting ready for antitrust action against Big Tech.
[03:31:49.770 --> 03:31:52.871]  He's getting ready to take on the globalist media that is the enemy of the people.
[03:31:53.351 --> 03:31:59.332]  We have to stand with the president now more than ever, and we have to let him know there's a coalition of a million people
[03:31:59.972 --> 03:32:02.636]  I'm going to found an organization very soon as well.
[03:32:02.897 --> 03:32:05.761]  That's another reason to come sign up with us so I can stay in contact with you.
[03:32:05.781 --> 03:32:10.688]  But this is phase one to show the president that we're sending him a million real letters.
[03:32:11.894 --> 03:32:13.315]  It's all about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:13.635 --> 03:32:18.357]  We can do it if you take action and tell others to take action at WriteTrump.com.
[03:32:18.497 --> 03:32:19.397]  So go there yourself.
[03:32:19.758 --> 03:32:22.339]  Text, message, email your friends, neighbors, family, and tell them.
[03:32:22.619 --> 03:32:24.700]  Get involved and stand up to Apple.
[03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:25.560]  Stand up to Google.
[03:32:25.580 --> 03:32:26.360]  Stand up to Facebook.
[03:32:26.581 --> 03:32:29.702]  Stand up to Twitter and let them know America is unifying.
[03:32:30.002 --> 03:32:32.783]  America and the world is organizing and taking action.
[03:32:33.324 --> 03:32:34.004]  God bless you all.
[03:32:40.316 --> 03:32:59.863]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:59.923 --> 03:33:05.165]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Joel Gilbert.
[03:33:05.905 --> 03:33:08.726]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.505 --> 03:33:13.206]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.266 --> 03:33:14.427]  Joel Gilbert with you.
[03:33:14.667 --> 03:33:18.109]  Guest hosting this hour from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:19.350 --> 03:33:19.970]  Please call in.
[03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:22.052]  We'll be taking calls this next couple segments.
[03:33:22.072 --> 03:33:22.592]  877-789-ALEX 877-789-ALEX
[03:33:28.359 --> 03:33:41.184]  2539.
[03:33:29.780 --> 03:33:41.184]  We are discussing the dangers of the slim margin of less than 1% that radical socialists openly received in the election.
[03:33:41.344 --> 03:33:46.886]  Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum almost got elected in Florida.
[03:33:47.206 --> 03:33:56.330]  Of course, Beto O'Rourke in Texas almost took that seat, while Kyrsten Sinema won in Arizona on an open radical platform.
[03:33:57.283 --> 03:34:01.627]  My guest, Brian Jundeff, is a doctor based in Denver.
[03:34:02.027 --> 03:34:03.649]  He's a writer for the American Thinker.
[03:34:03.709 --> 03:34:07.512]  He wrote a piece called, Will Trump be the Last Republican President?
[03:34:09.133 --> 03:34:10.494]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:10.575 --> 03:34:11.275]  Brian, are you there?
[03:34:12.136 --> 03:34:12.816]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:34:12.876 --> 03:34:13.457]  Thank you, Joel.
[03:34:13.697 --> 03:34:14.398]  Good to be with you.
[03:34:15.639 --> 03:34:16.319]  Great to have you.
[03:34:16.379 --> 03:34:22.164]  So, in this article, you wrote about, Will Trump be the last Republican president?
[03:34:22.244 --> 03:34:24.006]  And you broke it down into three parts.
[03:34:24.066 --> 03:34:25.127]  You called it demeanor,
[03:34:25.856 --> 03:34:27.877]  Demographics and deception.
[03:34:28.918 --> 03:34:30.279]  Let's take these one by one.
[03:34:30.299 --> 03:34:32.020]  Let's start with demeanor.
[03:34:32.740 --> 03:34:37.823]  How is this affecting the ability of a Republican to win in the future?
[03:34:37.863 --> 03:34:47.209]  Whether it's Trump, of course, 2020, even if he wins 2024, how does demeanor affect the ability of a Republican to win?
[03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:51.812]  Well, by demeanor, I don't mean it in a derogatory way.
[03:34:51.872 --> 03:34:53.653]  It's a positive demeanor.
[03:34:53.733 --> 03:34:54.954]  It's the fact that Trump
[03:34:55.791 --> 03:35:05.537]  Really was the only of 17 very competent, qualified primary candidates, any of whom could have served as president.
[03:35:06.238 --> 03:35:10.580]  Whether we like their politics or not, most of them all had very good experience.
[03:35:11.121 --> 03:35:12.382]  Trump's the only one that won.
[03:35:12.482 --> 03:35:20.907]  Trump was the only one that could fight back against the media onslaught, against all the forces on the left that were right against him.
[03:35:21.747 --> 03:35:23.489]  And none of the others would have made it.
[03:35:23.689 --> 03:35:29.153]  I think Trump is the only one that could have beaten Hillary Clinton in that election and could have survived.
[03:35:29.913 --> 03:35:32.035]  Imagine if Jeb Bush was president.
[03:35:32.555 --> 03:35:34.797]  He'd be going along with the establishment.
[03:35:34.837 --> 03:35:37.960]  We wouldn't have a quarter of the things we have now.
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:44.224]  Republican presidents wither under that type of pressure, but Trump has the demeanor to fight back.
[03:35:44.305 --> 03:35:48.528]  And if he's criticized, he will punch back harder than
[03:35:49.824 --> 03:35:50.285]  He's hit.
[03:35:50.865 --> 03:35:51.566]  He's a fighter.
[03:35:51.626 --> 03:35:53.207]  He's a street fighter from Queens.
[03:35:54.047 --> 03:35:58.790]  And unless we have somebody with that demeanor, they're not going to survive.
[03:35:59.131 --> 03:36:03.894]  The political environment is very toxic.
[03:36:03.914 --> 03:36:06.656]  95% of media coverage for Trump is negative.
[03:36:07.036 --> 03:36:09.297]  It wouldn't be much better with any other Republican.
[03:36:09.457 --> 03:36:13.080]  Might be 80% negative if it was Kasich or Bush or Rubio.
[03:36:13.980 --> 03:36:16.302]  But Trump can fight back and withstand that.
[03:36:17.239 --> 03:36:26.421]  Yeah, look, you talked about even the ability to become president is going to require a junkyard dog like Trump.
[03:36:26.941 --> 03:36:38.423]  And the old rhino type of Republican candidates, even Ted Cruz, who I know very well, he kind of wanted to go establishment.
[03:36:38.443 --> 03:36:40.203]  He said, I will not go there.
[03:36:40.363 --> 03:36:43.204]  I will not engage in this type of talk.
[03:36:44.252 --> 03:36:44.773]  That's a good question.
[03:37:09.923 --> 03:37:10.783]  Okay, let's talk about the next one.
[03:37:10.824 --> 03:37:11.084]  Yeah, okay.
[03:37:11.124 --> 03:37:11.964]  Next one is demographics.
[03:37:38.433 --> 03:37:42.714]  Go ahead and tell us what you wrote about as regards Texas, Florida.
[03:37:44.175 --> 03:37:56.278]  I can tell you that people in California, the California dream is to move to Texas to get away from the high taxes and the illegal immigrants, you know, driving around without insurance, all the issues.
[03:37:56.798 --> 03:37:59.859]  And I know a lot of New Yorkers who are quite liberal moved to Florida.
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:05.121]  How is that and what other things are possibly going to flip those states
[03:38:05.874 --> 03:38:09.097]  To Democrat states in a future presidential election.
[03:38:10.018 --> 03:38:13.461]  They leave those states, but they bring their liberal values with them.
[03:38:13.881 --> 03:38:23.670]  So they may not like living in a liberal state or a liberal city, but they still have their values with them and they bring them into the voting booth.
[03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:29.095]  So you're having more Democrat voters populating Texas and Florida.
[03:38:29.675 --> 03:38:31.177]  And if you look at the 2016 election,
[03:38:33.624 --> 03:38:37.385]  Trump won by 77 electoral votes.
[03:38:37.745 --> 03:38:40.406]  67 electoral votes are Texas and Florida.
[03:38:40.726 --> 03:38:43.767]  So imagine if those two states are flipped blue.
[03:38:44.727 --> 03:38:46.568]  Then all they need is one more state.
[03:38:46.788 --> 03:38:51.769]  You can pick off Michigan, Ohio, one of the Midwestern states, and it's lights out for Republicans.
[03:38:52.769 --> 03:38:55.150]  And this is not a one-off thing.
[03:38:55.210 --> 03:38:56.350]  This is not transient.
[03:38:56.390 --> 03:38:59.411]  If these people populate these states, they're staying there.
[03:39:00.214 --> 03:39:02.816]  Are they going to change from liberal to conservative?
[03:39:02.896 --> 03:39:03.857]  Not very likely.
[03:39:04.617 --> 03:39:06.779]  So, demographics are shifting.
[03:39:08.020 --> 03:39:09.661]  You have illegal immigration.
[03:39:09.701 --> 03:39:13.584]  You have illegal immigrants populating a lot of the southern states.
[03:39:14.525 --> 03:39:17.387]  A lot of them are voting, whether they shouldn't be or not, but they are.
[03:39:18.368 --> 03:39:21.170]  And they're more than likely going to vote Democrat.
[03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:26.214]  And then you look in Florida that just allowed a million felons to now vote.
[03:39:27.831 --> 03:39:30.512]  Imagine if even 5% of the felons vote.
[03:39:30.612 --> 03:39:31.993]  That's 50,000 votes.
[03:39:32.913 --> 03:39:39.016]  The governor and senator race in Florida were decided by a few tens of thousands of votes.
[03:39:39.517 --> 03:39:42.998]  So if 5% of the felons vote for the Democrat, that's it.
[03:39:44.419 --> 03:39:47.580]  Scott and DeSantis wouldn't have won.
[03:39:47.941 --> 03:39:52.843]  So you're seeing demographic shifts like that that are going to turn these red states blue.
[03:39:53.985 --> 03:40:05.309]  Right, let's mention Georgia, also a very conservative state, and by less than 1% or 1%, an open radical socialist, was still trying to take the governorship.
[03:40:05.882 --> 03:40:12.489]  And I would also argue it's not just lights out for the Republican Party, it's lights out for America.
[03:40:12.649 --> 03:40:13.791]  It's lights out for the U.S.
[03:40:13.811 --> 03:40:14.471]  Constitution.
[03:40:15.132 --> 03:40:25.303]  Obama showed that the Democrats would use the tools of state, IRS, FBI, DOJ, CIA, to suppress and interfere with the will of the people.
[03:40:26.008 --> 03:40:34.736]  Uh, the next, uh, Democrat president will most certainly not allow a fair election and use every tool in their power to keep a permanent hold on power.
[03:40:35.136 --> 03:40:40.060]  So I would argue that's the, uh, the danger is for the Constitution.
[03:40:40.100 --> 03:40:46.866]  They will, uh, eliminate amendment after amendment, appoint radical judges as Obama did.
[03:40:46.906 --> 03:40:47.807]  We got a taste of it.
[03:40:48.978 --> 03:40:50.159]  Last one is deception.
[03:40:50.700 --> 03:40:56.364]  How is the third one going to affect the ability of a Republican to win in the future?
[03:40:56.404 --> 03:40:56.945]  Deception.
[03:40:57.805 --> 03:40:59.947]  Well, deception is the cheating that we're seeing.
[03:41:00.167 --> 03:41:06.933]  You're seeing in California and Arizona and Florida votes that really don't make sense.
[03:41:07.473 --> 03:41:16.340]  When the Republican governor wins in Arizona by 300,000 votes and that doesn't carry down to the Senate race, sure.
[03:41:17.927 --> 03:41:26.353]  I mean, we're talking about the candidate, McSally, not being a strong conservative and being never Trump and all of that.
[03:41:26.433 --> 03:41:37.180]  But still, these traditionally red states all of a sudden have an overwhelming number of blue votes, a lot of them being found at the last minute.
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:40.962]  So the Democrats are trying to literally steal elections.
[03:41:41.002 --> 03:41:42.223]  You're seeing that in Florida.
[03:41:42.263 --> 03:41:43.664]  It's the provisional ballots.
[03:41:44.565 --> 03:41:47.267]  It's not counting voting irregularities, etc.
[03:41:48.326 --> 03:41:51.167]  And what they can't win outright, they will steal.
[03:41:51.727 --> 03:41:58.649]  And again, all it takes is a couple of states where you have these irregularities, and I don't see much pushback.
[03:41:58.929 --> 03:42:00.349]  Where are the Republicans?
[03:42:00.409 --> 03:42:05.011]  The Republican Party is, for the most part, silent on all of this.
[03:42:05.431 --> 03:42:13.293]  But this was the other way around, and this was 2008, and votes were being stolen from Obama.
[03:42:14.582 --> 03:42:15.722]  That's all that we'd hear about.
[03:42:16.103 --> 03:42:18.203]  The Democrats would be outraged.
[03:42:18.243 --> 03:42:20.144]  We've got to jump to a break.
[03:42:20.284 --> 03:42:20.704]  One second.
[03:42:20.764 --> 03:42:23.205]  Call in 877-789-2539.
[03:42:24.906 --> 03:42:32.048]  We're going to take a break and come back for a few minutes with the author of Will Trump Be the Last Republican President?
[03:42:32.088 --> 03:42:33.389]  We'll be right back after the break.
[03:42:36.818 --> 03:42:40.025]  There's only three days left for the mega sales.
[03:42:40.346 --> 03:42:42.871]  67% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:42:42.992 --> 03:42:44.996]  And don't forget, free shipping store-wide.
[03:42:45.076 --> 03:42:46.619]  That all ends in just three days.
[03:42:53.129 --> 03:42:57.911]  When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.
[03:42:57.931 --> 03:43:14.897]  You know, a long time ago, when I'd go on the radio and TV and talk about world government, the plan to microchip the population, the plan to have an EU army invade countries that try to leave it, and the plan to flood our nation with huge migrant caravans, people thought, man, this guy's really sincere.
[03:43:15.377 --> 03:43:16.038]  But is it true?
[03:43:16.958 --> 03:43:23.440]  Even though I would be on air showing people documents and UN reports and Council on Foreign Relations reports and the proof.
[03:43:24.441 --> 03:43:28.002]  Well now all that information we covered decades ago has come true.
[03:43:28.942 --> 03:43:30.283]  And so our credibility is pretty high.
[03:43:31.274 --> 03:43:37.636]  So the establishment wants us off the air, because we're telling people the next chapter of what's coming.
[03:43:37.656 --> 03:43:39.436]  Live every day from 11 a.m.
[03:43:39.816 --> 03:43:40.257]  to 3 p.m.
[03:43:40.297 --> 03:43:41.217]  just on my show.
[03:43:41.377 --> 03:43:43.898]  You got David Knight and the David Knight Show performing in the morning at 8 a.m.
[03:43:43.938 --> 03:43:44.278]  Central.
[03:43:44.738 --> 03:43:47.899]  You got Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others at 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:43:47.999 --> 03:43:48.779]  in the War Room.
[03:43:49.019 --> 03:43:51.020]  We're trying to expand to go at least 20 hours a day.
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:52.220]  They're trying to block that.
[03:43:53.140 --> 03:43:56.923]  And you've seen our information change the world because you supported InfoWars.
[03:43:57.583 --> 03:44:04.728]  We have been able to expose the globalists and let people know there's an alternative to their hegemonic system of absolute despotism.
[03:44:05.228 --> 03:44:07.750]  But to do that, we have to fund ourselves.
[03:44:08.530 --> 03:44:13.232]  And you've seen them systematically take our advertisers, not let us advertise online.
[03:44:13.252 --> 03:44:16.614]  Kick us off PayPal, kick us off Facebook, kick us off Twitter, kick us off YouTube.
[03:44:16.714 --> 03:44:23.437]  And over a hundred other platforms now, where they're even targeting the software companies that our websites and systems run off of.
[03:44:24.017 --> 03:44:32.061]  They're doing audits throughout the system, finding, by contacting companies, who we've actually bought things from to try to shut us down.
[03:44:32.101 --> 03:44:34.122]  That's because we are on target.
[03:44:34.203 --> 03:44:36.344]  We are exposing the globalist paradigm.
[03:44:36.384 --> 03:44:38.265]  We're exposing their main operation.
[03:44:38.825 --> 03:44:40.406]  Look, I know you guys know that.
[03:44:40.826 --> 03:44:41.666]  That's why you've supported us.
[03:44:41.726 --> 03:44:47.770]  But so many people who are listeners have never actually spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:44:49.051 --> 03:44:50.992]  And they've never actually bought any products.
[03:44:51.012 --> 03:45:01.242]  So I'm asking the listeners out there during this time of maximum effort, when we could turn the tide and people take action, to spread the word about InfoWars and NewsWars more than ever.
[03:45:01.622 --> 03:45:02.663]  To hand-share those links.
[03:45:02.723 --> 03:45:04.345]  To text message people.
[03:45:04.665 --> 03:45:06.126]  Information you think is particularly important.
[03:45:06.786 --> 03:45:08.127]  To get around the censors.
[03:45:08.167 --> 03:45:09.508]  Nothing can stop your word of mouth.
[03:45:10.008 --> 03:45:13.310]  And yes, to financially support M4 Wars.
[03:45:13.770 --> 03:45:16.352]  And we make it easy to support M4 Wars.
[03:45:16.652 --> 03:45:25.337]  My philosophy is, go out and find the best rated, best selling products, make them better, and then discount them.
[03:45:25.377 --> 03:45:28.559]  Water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[03:45:28.799 --> 03:45:30.740]  They're all there at M4WarsStore.com.
[03:45:30.780 --> 03:45:31.380]  Patriot apparel.
[03:45:32.060 --> 03:45:32.521]  It's all there.
[03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:46.263]  And right now, we're running a special for only another few days that is 67% off down to 49% off our best-selling items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:46.383 --> 03:45:59.027]  And we already had a huge mega sale where we were offering everything 50% off and free shipping to try to sell most of the stuff out of the warehouse because they're trying to actually shut InfoWars down itself and we can't even sell products.
[03:45:59.927 --> 03:46:02.868]  So a lot of products can't be on super discount because they're almost sold out.
[03:46:03.268 --> 03:46:07.670]  These are best sellers that we do have enough of to offer you the specials.
[03:46:07.710 --> 03:46:14.553]  So please take advantage of them today at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.

[03:46:41.369 --> 03:46:43.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:59.577 --> 03:47:03.299]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:47:03.639 --> 03:47:07.961]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.601 --> 03:47:14.144]  And now, your host, Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:14.184 --> 03:47:15.945]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.965 --> 03:47:20.207]  Joel Gilbert, final segment coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:47:20.747 --> 03:47:26.230]  We are speaking with Dr. Brian Jundeff, a writer for The American Thinker.
[03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:32.465]  Will Trump be the last Republican president based on these states flipping?
[03:47:33.386 --> 03:47:44.616]  Traditional Republican states, Arizona, Florida, Texas, have shown that 49.95% of the electorate are voting for radical socialists.
[03:47:45.056 --> 03:47:46.077]  Let's go to our call.
[03:47:46.117 --> 03:47:47.859]  Let's take Derek in North Carolina.
[03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:51.242]  Question for our guest.
[03:47:55.032 --> 03:47:57.154]  Yeah, just a comment on this exact situation here.
[03:47:57.434 --> 03:47:59.956]  Are these states really flipping?
[03:48:01.257 --> 03:48:02.418]  I don't think that they are.
[03:48:02.438 --> 03:48:07.883]  I don't think that any of us who have been really watching the situation know or think that they are.
[03:48:10.405 --> 03:48:17.851]  There's all this evidence of election pampering, of fraud, and that's just what we're seeing on the surface, what they're blatantly doing.
[03:48:19.132 --> 03:48:20.593]  My thinking is along these lines.
[03:48:20.673 --> 03:48:22.635]  I'm interested to know your thoughts on this.
[03:48:24.962 --> 03:48:36.850]  When President Trump won, there were allegations, or are allegations still to this day, of Russian meddling, and we've got the probe, and it's ongoing, and it's relentless, and it's ridiculous, and it's all bupkis, right?
[03:48:37.970 --> 03:48:41.493]  But what about meddling in the election by U.S.
[03:48:41.773 --> 03:48:43.014]  citizens?
[03:48:43.094 --> 03:48:46.076]  Is that not, then, technically treason?
[03:48:46.756 --> 03:48:49.838]  And that might sound crazy or over-the-top, or maybe not.
[03:48:49.858 --> 03:48:53.780]  I think it's perfectly reasonable to think that because... Alright, alright, thanks for the call.
[03:48:54.121 --> 03:49:01.205]  Look, Dr. Jindef, we know that there's massive voter fraud by Democrats.
[03:49:01.505 --> 03:49:05.708]  We have the alignment of NBC News, the entire media complex.
[03:49:05.728 --> 03:49:09.750]  Don't think they didn't coordinate the release of the Access Hollywood tape was coordinated.
[03:49:10.350 --> 03:49:14.413]  You've got enemies, foreign and domestic, as it says in the Constitution.
[03:49:15.810 --> 03:49:29.719]  Can the Republicans overcome this just massive effort on every level by the leftist media, the Democrat Party, their globalist allies, local fraudulent election officials?
[03:49:30.380 --> 03:49:42.007]  How can, like the caller said, that most people probably don't agree with all this nonsense, but somehow they're able to achieve electoral victory through all these different methods.
[03:49:42.507 --> 03:49:44.549]  Is there a path for Republicans to
[03:49:45.382 --> 03:49:46.743]  Have another Republican president.
[03:49:47.284 --> 03:49:47.764]  And what is it?
[03:49:48.004 --> 03:49:51.587]  Well, there is a path, but we haven't seen it in the past two years.
[03:49:52.148 --> 03:49:59.473]  Yes, the 2016 election, the deep state, the Obama FBI and DOJ tampered in the election.
[03:49:59.533 --> 03:50:04.057]  They tried to prevent Trump from getting elected and disrupt his transition.
[03:50:04.477 --> 03:50:11.163]  And since then, it's been the Russian collusion narrative and trying to undermine his presidency, have him impeached.
[03:50:12.034 --> 03:50:12.795]  I'm not up, Mr. Heather.
[03:50:42.753 --> 03:50:43.493]  Who's stopping him?
[03:50:44.673 --> 03:50:44.853]  Right.
[03:50:44.893 --> 03:50:52.395]  Look, I'll agree that I don't know why I get the theory was Trump was waiting till after the midterms to really clean up the clean house.
[03:50:53.095 --> 03:50:59.676]  Maybe he's just feel somehow neutralized by all these different actors and players coming after him.
[03:50:59.816 --> 03:51:03.757]  Now with the house flipped, there'll be no more investigations of the deep state.
[03:51:04.497 --> 03:51:08.378]  Let's go to Tammy in California from the People's Republic.
[03:51:08.798 --> 03:51:10.078]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:10.098 --> 03:51:10.358]  Go ahead.
[03:51:11.673 --> 03:51:12.954]  Hi Joel, it's Tammy.
[03:51:13.054 --> 03:51:19.097]  I just have to say first and foremost, for those liberals that are looking to go to Texas, Texas doesn't want you.
[03:51:19.117 --> 03:51:22.798]  Okay, so my question is this.
[03:51:23.579 --> 03:51:27.381]  We have been the number one state for fraud for many, many years.
[03:51:27.561 --> 03:51:36.125]  Why is it that Californians don't get off their lazy bums and, you know, do something about all the fraud?
[03:51:36.965 --> 03:51:38.646]  And then in connection with that,
[03:51:41.818 --> 03:51:43.179]  The sealed indictments.
[03:51:43.299 --> 03:51:46.220]  I haven't seen anything with the sealed indictments either.
[03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:49.282]  There's like thousands and thousands.
[03:51:49.322 --> 03:51:54.904]  What kind of fraud do you know about or have you experienced here in California other than what we read about?
[03:51:56.205 --> 03:52:03.408]  Well, I know for a fact there's a lot more Republicans in the inland parts of the state of California because I live there.
[03:52:04.048 --> 03:52:09.351]  And it's difficult for me to fathom that there's more Democrats in this state than there is.
[03:52:10.120 --> 03:52:11.001]  Uh, Republicans.
[03:52:11.241 --> 03:52:19.088]  And so, I've looked at the maps and the way that everything's broken down, and there's a lot less blue on the map in California than there is red.
[03:52:19.268 --> 03:52:26.114]  So, obviously, you know, Gavin Newsom, I'm sorry, but I really don't think he should have won.
[03:52:26.134 --> 03:52:28.375]  I think it was all frauded out.
[03:52:28.636 --> 03:52:37.223]  I think a lot of stuff is frauded out because, I don't know if you've noticed, but Californians always seem to wait, always seem to vote to have their taxes raised.
[03:52:37.845 --> 03:52:38.265]  Really?
[03:52:38.626 --> 03:52:39.967]  Are we that stupid?
[03:52:40.987 --> 03:52:43.349]  So, yeah, I don't understand that.
[03:52:43.649 --> 03:52:44.009]  Why?
[03:52:44.169 --> 03:52:49.293]  And that's one of the most frustrating things for me in this state, is that... Okay, good.
[03:52:49.333 --> 03:52:50.033]  That's a good point.
[03:52:50.093 --> 03:52:50.734]  Thanks for the call.
[03:52:50.774 --> 03:52:54.476]  Look, Dr. Jindeff, I see it everywhere I go.
[03:52:54.496 --> 03:53:04.023]  I don't think I've met very many people here in California, and I do have friends across the board, and they don't want higher taxes.
[03:53:04.743 --> 03:53:05.444]  They don't want
[03:53:06.807 --> 03:53:07.868]  Marijuana legalized.
[03:53:07.908 --> 03:53:12.752]  They don't want illegals coming in and taking over the jobs and reducing wages.
[03:53:13.753 --> 03:53:21.901]  When I was in Chicago filming There's No Place Like Utopia, all the people I met in the inner city, black people, they were almost like conservatives.
[03:53:21.921 --> 03:53:25.964]  They were saying, look, we don't want legal legalization of marijuana.
[03:53:25.984 --> 03:53:27.746]  We want illegals coming in our community.
[03:53:27.946 --> 03:53:28.867]  We want more police.
[03:53:29.620 --> 03:53:50.638]  Yet somehow the Democrats are controlling the emotions of people through their gender and identity politics to earn victories or combined with fraud that are seemingly giving them more and more power to the point, as you say, where we may not get another Republican president.
[03:53:50.878 --> 03:53:56.363]  Do you have a formula that you would recommend for the Republicans that they need to act now
[03:53:57.091 --> 03:54:04.157]  To make sure the Democrats don't continue their march to power that we know they'll never give up next time.
[03:54:05.017 --> 03:54:06.819]  The formula was two years ago.
[03:54:07.059 --> 03:54:11.282]  We gave Republicans control of the White House and both houses of Congress.
[03:54:12.103 --> 03:54:13.824]  And since then, we've had very little.
[03:54:14.245 --> 03:54:17.407]  Yes, we've had two good Supreme Court justices, tax cuts.
[03:54:17.948 --> 03:54:19.169]  The wall is not built.
[03:54:19.909 --> 03:54:21.431]  Obamacare is not repealed.
[03:54:22.211 --> 03:54:25.514]  Republicans in Congress have really dropped the ball on these issues.
[03:54:26.255 --> 03:54:28.316]  And it's not surprising that they lost the House.
[03:54:28.956 --> 03:54:34.078]  And you are correct that once Democrats get control of the White House and Congress, that's it.
[03:54:34.338 --> 03:54:37.059]  They will change the rules and they will never lose power again.
[03:54:37.079 --> 03:54:39.520]  2016 was a fluke.
[03:54:39.740 --> 03:54:41.361]  They all expected Hillary to win.
[03:54:42.081 --> 03:54:42.561]  She didn't.
[03:54:42.742 --> 03:54:43.842]  They were caught off guard.
[03:54:44.302 --> 03:54:45.303]  That won't happen again.
[03:54:46.063 --> 03:54:51.285]  And unless we have a strong candidate that can follow in Trump's footsteps, you'll have a Democrat president,
[03:54:52.065 --> 03:54:57.353]  You'll have at least one House, if not both Houses of Congress and Democrat hands, and that's it.
[03:54:57.974 --> 03:55:02.300]  I don't think Republicans will ever get power again, certainly not with a conservative candidate.
[03:55:02.873 --> 03:55:05.455]  They may get a John McCain type, but that's it.
[03:55:05.675 --> 03:55:06.835]  Yeah, we saw with Obama.
[03:55:06.875 --> 03:55:07.236]  Let me interrupt.
[03:55:07.256 --> 03:55:11.498]  We saw with Obama that once he took power, he just ruled by executive order.
[03:55:11.538 --> 03:55:12.719]  He didn't care about the Congress.
[03:55:13.299 --> 03:55:15.580]  And the media would not challenge these executive orders.
[03:55:16.001 --> 03:55:18.142]  And the courts were in his favor.
[03:55:18.622 --> 03:55:21.504]  So nothing would typically happen with these executive orders.
[03:55:22.304 --> 03:55:28.067]  So you can imagine the next Democrat president simply saying, well, we have to protect the voting.
[03:55:28.087 --> 03:55:28.748]  We have to protect
[03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:35.432]  People from racism, so we're going to change all these rules and kick it down the road.
[03:55:36.033 --> 03:55:43.717]  Let's take another caller for, let's take Jefferson and Virginia.
[03:55:44.057 --> 03:55:46.058]  Jefferson and Virginia, that's another swing state.
[03:55:46.418 --> 03:55:47.659]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:49.940]  Hey Joel, hey Doctor.
[03:55:50.881 --> 03:55:58.685]  I think we have to recognize that all the rules are going out the window and if the Democrats are going to change the rules as soon as they get in power, we might as well do it ourselves.
[03:55:59.642 --> 03:56:05.505]  And there should be a different metric for qualifying for voting, at least in national elections.
[03:56:05.525 --> 03:56:08.467]  There shouldn't be an attempt at anonymity when you vote.
[03:56:08.687 --> 03:56:12.849]  You should have a picture taken when you're voting, and a picture ID should be necessary.
[03:56:13.629 --> 03:56:16.411]  And if you're on public assistance, you shouldn't be allowed to vote.
[03:56:16.431 --> 03:56:19.052]  You're a ward of the state until you get off of public assistance.
[03:56:20.193 --> 03:56:23.615]  Okay, that one's a little tough to do, but thanks for the call.
[03:56:25.078 --> 03:56:36.866]  Look, Dr. Jindeff, can you comment on, we've got about a minute left, the Democrats preventing voter ID laws, trying to keep people on the rolls.
[03:56:37.107 --> 03:56:38.988]  That's been going on for years and years.
[03:56:39.068 --> 03:56:41.109]  Why aren't the Republicans trying to change that?
[03:56:41.129 --> 03:56:47.334]  Or are they so fearful of being charged with racism for forcing people to come with an ID?
[03:56:48.624 --> 03:56:49.845]  That's a really good question.
[03:56:49.905 --> 03:56:50.685]  Why haven't they?
[03:56:50.845 --> 03:56:54.827]  They had both Houses of Congress and the White House for the past two years.
[03:56:55.367 --> 03:56:58.269]  Trump ran on building a wall and repealing Obamacare.
[03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:59.169]  Neither happened.
[03:56:59.589 --> 03:57:01.230]  Trump can't do either of those alone.
[03:57:01.310 --> 03:57:02.631]  He's dependent on Congress.
[03:57:03.171 --> 03:57:10.495]  And unfortunately, he's fighting a battle not only against the Democrats, but against a lot of establishment Republicans.
[03:57:11.215 --> 03:57:14.837]  And unless they're gone and they're going to sign on with the Trump agenda,
[03:57:16.325 --> 03:57:20.028]  He's an army of one.
[03:57:20.268 --> 03:57:24.072]  Thank you for being here and we'll see you next time here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:24.112 --> 03:57:24.892]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:57:27.435 --> 03:57:32.539]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:36.431]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:57:36.471 --> 03:57:37.072]  It's a good thing.
[03:57:37.112 --> 03:57:40.314]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:57:40.895 --> 03:57:43.217]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:57:43.257 --> 03:57:44.398]  I learned what the best was.
[03:57:45.098 --> 03:57:58.349]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[03:57:58.849 --> 03:58:03.813]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[03:58:03.973 --> 03:58:08.437]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[03:58:08.917 --> 03:58:11.279]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[03:58:11.980 --> 03:58:16.344]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[03:58:18.015 --> 03:58:19.656]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[03:58:20.417 --> 03:58:22.698]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[03:58:22.718 --> 03:58:24.140]  That's when you get the best deals on cars.
[03:58:24.580 --> 03:58:30.124]  It's when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[03:58:30.324 --> 03:58:33.046]  $25,000 car, you're probably going to pay $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[03:58:33.626 --> 03:58:34.867]  And that's not counting state taxes.
[03:58:34.907 --> 03:58:35.648]  A lot of states have.
[03:58:35.748 --> 03:58:36.488]  Texas has that too.
[03:58:36.508 --> 03:58:38.830]  Now there's inventory tax, franchise tax.
[03:58:39.250 --> 03:58:40.852]  That's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[03:58:41.432 --> 03:58:44.234]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[03:58:46.789 --> 03:58:50.776]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[03:58:51.156 --> 03:58:53.220]  We normally sell for $249 and it's a great deal.
[03:58:53.240 --> 03:58:54.742]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[03:58:54.782 --> 03:58:54.962]  It's $127.
[03:58:55.002 --> 03:58:58.448]  He's selling them to us every day.
