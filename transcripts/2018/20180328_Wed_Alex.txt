[00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:37.789]  Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Cuomo has come out, along with many others, with a new talking point.
[00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.993]  They say that you never heard anyone say that they want to repeal the Second Amendment or even ban semi-autos.
[00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:50.834]  It's a conspiracy theory made up by yours truly.
[00:00:52.055 --> 00:01:03.519]  That's right, this morning I saw a whole bunch of news articles that just mentioned Jones is insanely claiming someone wants to repeal the Second Amendment and the NRA and Dana
[00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:12.622]  is saying and all these other groups and organizations are just raising an alarm that is crying wolf.
[00:01:15.503 --> 00:01:18.544]  But we have the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court calling for it.
[00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:26.708]  We have the different students at the marches as public figures calling for that right to be stripped from other Americans, to have our basic right to defense raped.
[00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:31.444]  We have all these organizations that have introduced legislation to do it.
[00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:34.025]  You've got areas like Chicago and D.C.
[00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:39.668]  where they had total gun bans until the Supreme Court ruled six years ago in D.C.
[00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:43.971]  v. Heller that they had to allow some gun rights and they still basically haven't done it.
[00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:53.156]  So you see a microcosm here of the incredible disdain that they have for everybody.
[00:01:55.583 --> 00:02:04.311]  When they go, there's no world government, we're just having a world government summit, announcing the world government, and the world army, and the world tax, and by the way, it's authoritarian and unelected.
[00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:09.176]  They would deny there was an EU until the mid-90s, and they officially launched it in 2000.
[00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:10.097]  Remember that?
[00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.540]  I remember being on talk radio in 96.
[00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:19.458]  And they were just then admitting the EU even was being set up, because it was unelected.
[00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:28.569]  People entered trade deals, and suddenly they were told, by the way, the UN is now in control of NATO, and the EU over you.
[00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.052]  And there's an unelected bureaucracy that runs it.
[00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:33.756]  But don't worry, we're going to have elections to a parliament.
[00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:36.035]  That's advisory.
[00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:43.338]  And people go, oh, can I be on the advisory parliament with ceremonial elections to advise the permanent government?
[00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:45.519]  That's how communist countries operate.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.663]  So that's how crazy this is, and how they play these mind games.
[00:02:53.763 --> 00:03:04.311]  But it doesn't work anymore, and even the Council on Foreign Relations and all their top publications admit the New World Order globalism is dead on arrival, their program will never be put back together again.
[00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:18.242]  Doesn't mean they didn't steal trillions, doesn't mean the globalists aren't still big evil organizations, doesn't mean they're not still swindling and taking control of things, but their big world government push with that unelected system everywhere is being revolted against.
[00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:18.962]  And of course it is.
[00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:20.724]  Once it's identified, it's over.
[00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:22.325]  Now, that said,
[00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:29.587]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we return from break, I'm going to roll through everything.
[00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:33.690]  It is incredible the amount of news we've got here.
[00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.054]  Zuckerberg and Microsoft, not just Facebook, caught spying on all your private communications, breaking into your phones.
[00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.416]  I mean, just controlling everything.
[00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:48.299]  They really blew it with this Analytica thing.
[00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.180]  That was the string on the sweater.
[00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:52.525]  It's amazing.
[00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:53.665]  That's all up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:55.887]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:57.568]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:04.793]  I told you back on March 7th and March 8th and 9th that Kim Jong-un had already agreed to Trump's terms ahead of meeting.
[00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:12.017]  And now North Korea and China have announced the terms are already agreed to and were agreed to back in that early March meeting that we told you about.
[00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:13.778]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.580]  Next week's news today.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.986]  That's why they hate us and want us banned, because we have the real sources and we get the real information out to you.
[00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:33.479]  Mattis has come out in a press conference and bragged about killing Russians in Syria, which is just a really terrible thing, and I'm not trying to attack Mattis, but this is bad, as this whole Cold War goes into a hot war with Russia.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.203]  Trump says they will never repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:51.107]  But meanwhile, the left is calling for Infowars to be banned again, saying we're not allowed to criticize the public figures, the high school seniors like David Hogg, that says we're shaking in our boots, and who challenges us to debates, but then won't do it.
[00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:53.750]  He can call me a piece of you-know-what, you name it.
[00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.815]  I've got to treat him like he is the Pope's god.
[00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:00.797]  I mean, like he's the king of the universe.
[00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:02.419]  He's just the master of everything.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.623]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:08.348]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:14.091]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:26.956]  Alright folks, I've been on the phone all morning with my lawyers.
[00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:28.457]  Didn't get to work out this morning.
[00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:43.263]  Or play with my baby daughter as long as I'd like to, because I spent three hours dealing with it and I can't announce it yet, but there's been another dastardly, illegal, fraudulent attempt to take down our YouTube channel with billions of views.
[00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.945]  So it is just ongoing, live time as we speak.
[00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:57.192]  And we're had to have to file injunctions, a bunch of other stuff, but the war for the First Amendment is on right now, ladies and gentlemen, and it is intense.
[00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:03.244]  I've got an announcement to make here.
[00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:08.987]  I am endorsing David Hogg.
[00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.209]  I am endorsing the March for Our Lives.
[00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.870]  I am endorsing George Soros.
[00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:17.933]  I am endorsing Michael Bloomberg.
[00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:20.294]  I am endorsing Michael Moore.
[00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:26.999]  I am endorsing the former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
[00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:31.732]  When they came out and said, repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:37.137]  And you've got them saying, give us financial, take it a mile.
[00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:39.358]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.681]  We want all guns banned except for single-shot black powder.
[00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:46.524]  That's what John Stevens is publicly proposing.
[00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:54.171]  And that is what the same globalists have done in every other nation but the United States and Switzerland.
[00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.756]  They had everything we had 20 years ago in Australia.
[00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:01.977]  They're down to single shots with special licenses.
[00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:05.397]  And the real Crocodile Dundee in the mid-1990s.
[00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:08.538]  This was only in the NRA magazine and I checked it.
[00:08:08.858 --> 00:08:10.158]  It's in newspapers in Australia.
[00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:11.759]  The real Crocodile Dundee.
[00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:12.859]  Looked just like the guy.
[00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:15.340]  Really wrestled crocodiles.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.381]  You know, made Steve Irwin look like a wimp.
[00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:21.641]  And Irwin was an amazing, talented guy as well.
[00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:22.681]  Rest his soul.
[00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:24.802]  Great guy.
[00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:33.513]  He was way out in the bush, in his little farmhouse, and they came and killed him.
[00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:36.576]  He killed three of the federal police as well.
[00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.698]  But he died in a shootout with them taking his guns.
[00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.983]  So when they say they're coming for our guns, folks, they mean it, and it is our American ethos.
[00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:50.007]  And so Paul Watson's doing a video, I was talking to him this morning, saying, listen,
[00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:52.319]  You gotta do a judo move here.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.624]  Trump's poll numbers are up 5 to 10 points, even in the fake polls that oversample Democrats, 15 points on average.
[00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:07.890]  All Republican poll numbers are up in battleground states, in purple states.
[00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.352]  Suddenly they've gained 5 to 10, in some cases 20 points.
[00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:18.537]  The blue wave of Soros money and hysteria had a chance of taking the House of Representatives.
[00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:29.873]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, right now, they have wounded that by their arrogance.
[00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:41.119]  And I was told, off record, by a very interesting, prominent pro-gun person, who said some of it on record, I think I'm going to air the Ted Nugent extended interview tomorrow, we played excerpts, but I think I'm going to air it tomorrow.
[00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:48.022]  It's an hour and a half long, it's amazing, at his house, north of Austin, at his ranch, with his great wife, dogs, and family.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:10:12.195]  He let me in on Inside Baseball that I'd also been told that... He said some of it, I'm not going to get into it all, but 100% Trump goes, oh let's legalize all these people, and the Democrats go, no you're a racist, we must have totally open borders, and one person can have 20 people deep come in, no vetting, and felons can stay, and then nothing happens on DACA.
[00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:18.389]  And that's what Trump is doing, going, oh yeah, take the guns, you're right, sure, you're winning.
[00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:21.430]  And then they run out and go, we're taking them, we're winning, it's over!
[00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.970]  Destroy America!
[00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:29.051]  And I just, rhetorically, I don't like doing that tactic, but that is what Trump's doing.
[00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:30.452]  Everybody needs to know that.
[00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:39.154]  And it is 4-D chess, and I had a discussion with Paul, and he's right.
[00:10:39.594 --> 00:10:41.094]  I endorse David Hogg.
[00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.249]  I don't think he's following gun talking points.
[00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.110]  I think it's totally real.
[00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:51.112]  I think every student at that school is anti-gun.
[00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:54.794]  And I'm glad CNN's banned all those students that wanted to come on that were pro-gun.
[00:10:56.015 --> 00:10:58.236]  And I just think Hogg is a hero.
[00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:04.260]  And I think it's good to say that we're shaking in our boots, wanting to be disarmed and live like folks do in Chicago.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:16.724]  And when he says everyone's shaking and makes a little evil face, that no one's allowed to criticize him when he's up there in front of a jumbotron on every TV station in America, that you do not ever question him.
[00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:20.225]  And I agree with Hogg and his supporters that have called for me being banned off YouTube.
[00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:21.025]  You know what?
[00:11:21.205 --> 00:11:21.706]  They're right.
[00:11:21.886 --> 00:11:23.646]  This isn't 21st century book burning.
[00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:28.608]  But see, I also want to get it straight in my head that Cuomo's right.
[00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:41.942]  You know, the governor's little brother, who gets to do hit-and-runs in front of everybody and run over people's cars and stuff in front of people at a town fair, fall out drunk last year and then not get in trouble.
[00:11:42.343 --> 00:11:42.903]  That's on record.
[00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:44.604]  He's allowed to hit-and-run drunk driving.
[00:11:45.064 --> 00:11:46.425]  He's allowed to read WikiLeaks, too.
[00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:49.946]  He said, I can read WikiLeaks, but if you do, you're going to be arrested.
[00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:55.469]  By the way, Assange had his internet cut off just 30 minutes ago, so they're saying they may SWAT team him at any time.
[00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:56.029]  We'll see.
[00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:57.510]  We'll follow that.
[00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.511]  Pray for Julian Assange, a real hero.
[00:12:00.831 --> 00:12:04.313]  Members of the British Parliament are calling him a sniveling worm today, which is a tip off.
[00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.214]  They're getting ready to move on him.
[00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:10.817]  But Cuomo, he says no one is calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
[00:12:10.978 --> 00:12:12.158]  It's a boogeyman.
[00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:23.946]  So you've got the New York Times front page, you've got the former Supreme Court judges, you've got all these other liberals, Democrats, globalists, everywhere they're in control, they end up taking all the guns.
[00:12:26.735 --> 00:12:33.677]  But Cuomo says it doesn't exist, and that's the new talking point by Democratic strategists, is stop saying that!
[00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:38.218]  Of course we're gonna ban all semi-auto, which is 90 plus percent of firearms.
[00:12:38.498 --> 00:12:49.941]  That's what I keep saying, it's just this Bushmaster, it's just this one rifle, and then magically the shooters always use that one, and they always go to a victim disarmament zone, and always a blue city, always a blue state, always a blue county.
[00:12:51.482 --> 00:12:52.542]  There's always a stand down.
[00:12:57.952 --> 00:13:08.177]  You know, so-called assault rifles of that type are used in less than 2% of the crime, but magically they're used in all school shootings, all real mass shootings.
[00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:14.961]  You may have a gangbanger shoot a couple other gangbangers with a handgun, but all the big ones, all the big productions.
[00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:17.581]  When I say productions, the media.
[00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:18.982]  Hypes is where you go kill people.
[00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.243]  They hype, it's like an option for somebody that wants to commit suicide.
[00:13:22.743 --> 00:13:29.005]  Just like they used to know when somebody jumped off the Empire States Building and it got on the news, you'd have five more people the next day do it.
[00:13:29.365 --> 00:13:31.705]  Until you had to station police up there and plexiglass it off.
[00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:34.466]  Because, oh, somebody just jumped off the Empire States Building, let me do it.
[00:13:34.806 --> 00:13:39.067]  Well, other loons go, well, the number one thing in our news and our culture is school shootings.
[00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:45.029]  And so let me see, I'll just go to a blue state area, I'll be on all these drugs, they'll know I'm coming to kill people.
[00:13:45.836 --> 00:13:53.398]  They'll stand down as usual, 20 plus times beforehand, and then when he goes in to shoot people, they stand down again, and then gun owners get blamed for it.
[00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:59.280]  So Cuomo says nobody's trying to take your guns.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.760]  They've just taken them everywhere else.
[00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:06.802]  This is the level of mind control they think you're under.
[00:14:07.182 --> 00:14:10.883]  Aren't you as Democrats insulted by Cuomo talking to you like this?
[00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:17.358]  But see, they gotta get their people mobilized to take the guns, but at the same time, they want to tell you, so you hesitate.
[00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:18.699]  It's a military tactic.
[00:14:18.739 --> 00:14:19.960]  In World War I, they started doing it.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.581]  The Germans did.
[00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:22.782]  The Austro-Hungarians did.
[00:14:23.283 --> 00:14:28.967]  They would, through loudspeakers, in English and in French, we, and Russian, we are not attacking.
[00:14:28.987 --> 00:14:29.908]  This is not an assault.
[00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:32.129]  Your commanders have laid down their arms.
[00:14:32.229 --> 00:14:32.790]  Surrender.
[00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.811]  We have food.
[00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:34.731]  We have medicine.
[00:14:35.352 --> 00:14:40.336]  As the shells are falling, and a small percentage of the people in the bunkers
[00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:43.794]  And at the guns, would go, you see?
[00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:44.635]  They are friends!
[00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:45.355]  They want to be nice!
[00:14:45.596 --> 00:14:46.396]  I'm your friend!
[00:14:46.496 --> 00:14:46.897]  Help me!
[00:14:47.197 --> 00:14:47.778]  And you get shot.
[00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:51.530]  And so Cuomo's like, no one wants your guns.
[00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.710]  There is no world government.
[00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.691]  No one's coming for your kids.
[00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:55.051]  Liberals love you.
[00:14:55.492 --> 00:14:56.332]  Take your Prozac.
[00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:57.312]  Everything's fine.
[00:14:57.332 --> 00:14:58.173]  Drink your fluoride.
[00:14:58.553 --> 00:14:59.373]  Liberalism's good.
[00:14:59.413 --> 00:15:00.394]  World government's good.
[00:15:00.674 --> 00:15:02.655]  Never mind all the big billionaires that are tax-exempt.
[00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:03.855]  Listen to Zuckerberg.
[00:15:04.076 --> 00:15:04.916]  Listen to Zuckerberg.
[00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:05.696]  Listen to Bezos.
[00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:06.437]  Listen to Bill Gates.
[00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:07.597]  Listen to Warren Buffett.
[00:15:07.637 --> 00:15:08.237]  They love you.
[00:15:08.498 --> 00:15:09.598]  They know how to take care of you.
[00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:10.258]  They love you.
[00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:13.620]  We have coffin apartments ready for you that cost more than regular apartments.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.981]  Lower your standard of living.
[00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:15.622]  It's cool.
[00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:16.843]  It's cool to be a slave.
[00:15:16.903 --> 00:15:17.684]  Excuse me, huh?
[00:15:18.064 --> 00:15:20.326]  I'm a raving mafia scumbag.
[00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:21.187]  Just lay down to me.
[00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:25.351]  So when we come back from break, Como says...
[00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:32.607]  It doesn't exist, and then I'm going to play them saying they want to confiscate our guns and all the signs and the rest of it.
[00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:33.188]  And guess what?
[00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:33.929]  It's in the news now.
[00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:39.814]  Google suddenly today started blocking searches for banned gun signs in videos.
[00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:48.383]  So Google's working around the clock, that's admitted in the news, I've got the articles, to block InfoWars and others just like they block our videos.
[00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:54.580]  From searches and bantams showing other young people at the school saying they stood down.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.700]  They stood down.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.881]  We don't want to turn our guns in.
[00:15:57.421 --> 00:15:58.761]  Those videos were banned.
[00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:01.823]  And now, them saying they want to take your guns.
[00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:09.196]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:17.661]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:22.524]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:16:22.885 --> 00:16:23.605]  We only have 150%.
[00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:24.766]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[00:16:26.607 --> 00:16:28.889]  Well now it's 50% off.
[00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:37.854]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[00:16:37.874 --> 00:16:39.375]  Rain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:41.076]  But the two go together.
[00:16:41.176 --> 00:16:42.857]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:47.580]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:52.404]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:52.684 --> 00:16:57.507]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.
[00:16:57.887 --> 00:17:02.210]  InfoWarsLife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and Real Red Pill today.
[00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:19.742]  We went out and looked.
[00:17:19.782 --> 00:17:20.342]  What is the top?
[00:17:20.422 --> 00:17:20.963]  What is the best?
[00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:22.544]  We'll just put even more product in.
[00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:23.164]  We'll make it better.
[00:17:23.264 --> 00:17:25.706]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it.
[00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:26.126]  Sell it for $60.
[00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:29.549]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:31.790]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.812]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:39.115]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:43.218]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the globals, the rest of it.
[00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:46.680]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.041]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.683]  And I want people that haven't tried, brain-forced, to try it and find out why.
[00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:56.245]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:17:56.545 --> 00:17:57.225]  It's amazing.
[00:17:57.546 --> 00:18:00.567]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:18:00.607 --> 00:18:04.510]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:04.850]  Go ahead.
[00:18:05.764 --> 00:18:07.667]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:18:07.707 --> 00:18:17.105]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:24.442]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:18:24.662 --> 00:18:27.004]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:27.304]  Thank you.
[00:18:27.984 --> 00:18:32.906]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.227]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:37.749]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:18:37.809 --> 00:18:38.789]  They are quality.
[00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.370]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.572]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:18:43.752 --> 00:18:44.112]  Absolutely.
[00:18:44.813 --> 00:18:57.704]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[00:19:02.515 --> 00:19:11.523]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:19.831]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:24.675]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:31.577]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:31.657 --> 00:19:38.739]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.639]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:45.721]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:50.202]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:19:50.342 --> 00:19:53.563]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:19:53.723 --> 00:19:55.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:22.643 --> 00:20:26.790]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:29.033]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.246 --> 00:20:53.115]  So John Paul Stevens comes out three days ago and says repeal the second amendment, ban it down to nothing but black powder, single shot, with a license, pretty much what Australia's done, and every other country the globalists got control of, and every city they have control of, total gun bans, an incredible crime, and government mafia ruling over everyone, and we've got
[00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:57.681]  The marchers and the main students saying, give us an inch, we'll take it a mile.
[00:20:58.521 --> 00:21:00.342]  The signs saying, we're going to ban the guns.
[00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:05.185]  Dianne Feinstein saying, if I could ban all the semi-autos, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:21:05.505 --> 00:21:07.646]  We know the goal of the UN.
[00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:17.031]  In the treaty Obama signed, and the accompanying codices of how it's carried out, because the UN always has these treaties open-ended.
[00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:20.022]  Just like Obamacare was open and they can do whatever they want.
[00:21:20.503 --> 00:21:27.747]  It said, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state and so needs to be abolished.
[00:21:29.749 --> 00:21:32.130]  For the good of the tranquility and peace of the world.
[00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.271]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:21:35.312 --> 00:21:36.593]  That's pretty much an exact quote.
[00:21:36.613 --> 00:21:38.674]  I think I'm paraphrasing the end of it.
[00:21:39.134 --> 00:21:41.376]  My memory is not completely photographic as it once was.
[00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:42.777]  But here we are.
[00:21:44.465 --> 00:21:55.767]  Cuomo, and this is so fundamental, and other ones are running around now, like chickens, who took a large dose of methamphetamine, PCP, LSD, and then had their heads chopped off.
[00:21:58.688 --> 00:22:00.088]  Saying, no one wants your guns!
[00:22:00.328 --> 00:22:00.809]  No, no, no!
[00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:03.609]  So they're back to the old, we don't want your guns!
[00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:04.689]  We're your friends!
[00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:06.250]  We care about you!
[00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:10.373]  There's no world government.
[00:22:10.754 --> 00:22:11.655]  There's nothing going on.
[00:22:11.675 --> 00:22:13.497]  No one's spying on you.
[00:22:13.537 --> 00:22:14.418]  No one's surveilling you.
[00:22:14.578 --> 00:22:20.385]  Don't listen to Alex Jones saying Kim Jong Un already agreed to Trump's terms back in early March, which is now completely confirmed today.
[00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:22.207]  And Jones has incredible sources.
[00:22:22.227 --> 00:22:23.248]  We can't let you know he has those.
[00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:24.469]  He's fake news.
[00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.432]  Oh yeah, that's coming up as well.
[00:22:27.998 --> 00:22:56.846]  So here's Cuomo talking to CNN viewers like they are the biggest morons on the planet, but if you go out, and I've got hours of raw video shot by Millie Weaver and Owen Schroer and others at different rallies around the country, but just the ones last weekend, and I sat there last night after my wife went to bed, there were thunderstorms, so I woke up at about midnight, so I got up, went and ate some cereal, and I'm sitting there in the kitchen and I'm watching these videos,
[00:22:57.788 --> 00:23:01.031]  And I mean, they'll go 10 minutes and nobody even chants or talk.
[00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:03.213]  Then they'll go, we vote!
[00:23:03.533 --> 00:23:04.454]  Turn in the guns!
[00:23:04.714 --> 00:23:05.554]  We vote!
[00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:06.715]  We have the power!
[00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:10.098]  And then no one talks for like 10 minutes.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.744]  And then you see people and no one can even talk.
[00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:24.230]  And then they'll have a minder come over and say, don't talk to them, even if we don't have an Infowars microphone, a flag.
[00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.173]  It says Action 7, whatever.
[00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:28.073]  They don't care.
[00:23:28.093 --> 00:23:34.897]  And you realize, oh my God, even when other leftists try to talk to each other, another one will walk over and say, don't talk to them.
[00:23:35.357 --> 00:23:44.822]  These are like zombie followers, and they all have like slumped shoulders, and little chicken arms, and like big turkey goblet things hanging off their necks.
[00:23:45.242 --> 00:23:47.043]  Black, white, old, young, Hispanic.
[00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:51.385]  And you look at these people's eyes, it looks like their souls were sucked.
[00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:53.346]  It's the opposite of not having light.
[00:23:54.431 --> 00:23:55.812]  There's not even a deadness.
[00:23:55.892 --> 00:23:57.192]  It's like there's nothing there.
[00:23:58.192 --> 00:23:59.493]  They're just empty.
[00:24:01.353 --> 00:24:02.494]  And that's what's going on.
[00:24:02.514 --> 00:24:14.638]  The left is culturally, spiritually, like soul-sucked followers, and then you realize they are true evil.
[00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.280]  I mean, their crowds are ugly, stupid,
[00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:35.695]  And then you've got the upper-caste controller ones that are always smiling with pleasure and kind of grooming little stables of minions and everyone comes over and the men all look beyond effeminate when you look at them.
[00:24:35.715 --> 00:24:47.464]  They're all like standing there, pursing their lips, going, mmm, listening to whatever's said and just stand with all these little arms wobbling around looking like little bizarre overfed chickens or something.
[00:24:47.724 --> 00:24:51.227]  I mean, it's like, thank God we're not these people.
[00:24:52.216 --> 00:25:09.861]  And then you get Hogg and, you know, the art class and the acting class who were at the real shooting, real event, but who are the spokespersons from the acting drama club to go out in their little Hollywood outfits and stuff like they're trying to do a casting call for the, you know, third season of Stranger Things.
[00:25:13.042 --> 00:25:14.402]  And it's a big production!
[00:25:15.062 --> 00:25:16.523]  Kind of like when I saw Hillary Clinton
[00:25:18.007 --> 00:25:25.853]  At her town hall a couple years ago, and I said, that shot in super HD, those are all actors, that's a fake town hall.
[00:25:26.954 --> 00:25:29.036]  WikiLeaks came out, that was a fake town hall.
[00:25:29.376 --> 00:25:31.298]  We know when it's a movie, folks!
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.601]  You can look at a documentary and tell when it's real.
[00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:37.142]  You can just look at it, you know.
[00:25:37.483 --> 00:25:38.644]  You know when something's fake.
[00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.290]  And so what I'm saying is it's synthetic.
[00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.351]  It's AstroTurf.
[00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.351]  And they say that's the big crime.
[00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:46.872]  It's all over the news that they want to shut InfoWars down.
[00:25:47.092 --> 00:25:48.412]  They want to soothe some more.
[00:25:48.612 --> 00:25:55.654]  They want us off YouTube because I made comparisons to the youth marches to Mao Tse-Tung and Hitler, which is totally comparable.
[00:25:55.814 --> 00:25:57.034]  They're even wearing armbands.
[00:25:58.274 --> 00:26:00.635]  And they're funded by a Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.100]  And they want our free speech!
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.621]  I mean, wow, that story's on Infowars.com.
[00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:07.642]  But since I mentioned it, here's Cuomo.
[00:26:08.062 --> 00:26:10.682]  Here's Cuomo saying nobody is going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:11.543]  Here it is.
[00:26:11.563 --> 00:26:16.784]  And you got the President of the United States this morning tweeting that the Second Amendment will never be repealed.
[00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:20.425]  We must have more... Who's calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment?
[00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:21.145]  Who's calling for it?
[00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:22.206]  Justice Stevens did.
[00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:22.826]  He did not.
[00:26:22.866 --> 00:26:26.467]  It was in the context of a conversation about the fastest route to legal change.
[00:26:26.487 --> 00:26:28.327]  And of course, if it hadn't... All right, hit pause.
[00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:28.707]  Hit pause.
[00:26:29.007 --> 00:26:29.808]  He did not.
[00:26:30.508 --> 00:26:30.968]  Go read it.
[00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:33.780]  Headline, repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:34.641]  He did not.
[00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:37.504]  Talk about a mind game.
[00:26:37.544 --> 00:26:37.984]  Let's continue.
[00:26:38.004 --> 00:26:40.887]  If you didn't have a Second Amendment, you wouldn't have Heller.
[00:26:41.107 --> 00:26:42.788]  It would be easier to change the laws.
[00:26:42.988 --> 00:26:43.929]  He's not a politician.
[00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.950]  He's not in office.
[00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.912]  He's not the head of any kind of significant group.
[00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.953]  Oh, he's just a former Supreme Court Justice.
[00:26:49.514 --> 00:26:49.974]  Shut it down.
[00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:51.936]  Let's go out to break with this clip.
[00:26:52.597 --> 00:26:56.660]  I can't get to it all, but this is the Dems, and they're coming at your guns.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.422]  And when we return, all the times they called us Hitler,
[00:27:00.461 --> 00:27:06.485]  But now, if you compare this march to Hitlerian operations, well, then you need to be banned off the internet, which is Hitlerian.
[00:27:06.525 --> 00:27:06.885]  Here it is.
[00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:21.514]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:27:21.654 --> 00:27:25.697]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:26.938]  You've heard people say,
[00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:31.045]  You'll have to pry my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:27:31.225 --> 00:27:31.546]  Okay.
[00:27:35.165 --> 00:27:38.007]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[00:27:38.067 --> 00:27:41.630]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[00:27:41.771 --> 00:27:45.814]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:50.598]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:57.484]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:27:57.584 --> 00:27:57.884]  Enough.
[00:27:58.445 --> 00:27:58.725]  Enough.
[00:27:59.225 --> 00:27:59.545]  Enough.
[00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:02.188]  We say no more!
[00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:06.651]  Even the presentation during the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.
[00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:11.576]  subjected the participants with know-thy-enemy style exposition.
[00:28:11.596 --> 00:28:12.496]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:13.797]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:28:13.978 --> 00:28:19.903]  If you try to take our firearms, it doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:28:20.103 --> 00:28:21.364]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:28:23.152 --> 00:28:30.001]  A great example of how the average liberal SJW is so stupid and uneducated on the matters of gun control.
[00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:31.342]  Enough is enough!
[00:28:31.903 --> 00:28:32.324]  Enough is enough!
[00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:34.306]  Not one of them can tell me what they're marching for.
[00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:37.150]  Do you think the Imperials would want to take the guns in Star Wars?
[00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.752]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:40.033]  I hate Infowars.
[00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:40.774]  This is amazing.
[00:28:40.794 --> 00:28:41.355]  This is amazing.
[00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:43.838]  Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:28:44.238 --> 00:28:50.444]  He says that we want your guns, which we do, but you're still insane if you say we do.
[00:28:50.524 --> 00:28:52.286]  I'm quoting from the legislation right here.
[00:28:52.646 --> 00:28:52.926]  We'll be back.
[00:28:52.986 --> 00:28:53.887]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:09.242]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:29:09.482 --> 00:29:14.183]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[00:29:14.783 --> 00:29:20.624]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:33.626]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[00:29:34.386 --> 00:29:43.073]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:29:43.093 --> 00:29:44.995]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:46.436]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:29:46.476 --> 00:29:47.737]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[00:29:47.937 --> 00:29:49.118]  He doesn't drink anything.
[00:29:49.338 --> 00:29:50.798]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:29:51.318 --> 00:29:52.939]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:54.739]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:57.680]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.580]  This is insane.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.620]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.421]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[00:30:03.861 --> 00:30:05.401]  He says, this is totally free.
[00:30:05.421 --> 00:30:07.242]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[00:30:07.262 --> 00:30:09.122]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:15.924]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[00:30:16.164 --> 00:30:17.504]  All just moderate dose.
[00:30:19.036 --> 00:30:27.028]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[00:30:27.068 --> 00:30:29.451]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:29.491 --> 00:30:30.633]  But thank you for committing.
[00:30:34.697 --> 00:30:40.502]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it, but it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:30:40.522 --> 00:30:45.286]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:55.034]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:56.676]  It's called reap what you sow.
[00:31:03.547 --> 00:31:05.247]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:31:05.847 --> 00:31:07.168]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:32:02.782 --> 00:32:06.644]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:07.204 --> 00:32:14.608]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:20.011]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:20.611 --> 00:32:22.512]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:23.152 --> 00:32:26.574]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:29.836]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:30.536 --> 00:32:37.179]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:45.023]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:45.884 --> 00:32:52.527]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:53.107 --> 00:32:54.188]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:54.548 --> 00:32:56.369]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:57.189 --> 00:33:00.171]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:33:00.691 --> 00:33:21.144]  That's Infowarslife.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show Big Brother
[00:33:22.589 --> 00:33:23.829]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.951]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:28.891]  You want answers?
[00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:31.572]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:38.094]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.615 --> 00:33:44.236]  Well, the greedy Democrats really took the bait, didn't they?
[00:33:45.322 --> 00:33:55.125]  Trump began to signal that he was for reasonable gun restrictions, but we all know they really just want to repeal the Second Amendment, as they've done in countries across the world, taking the right to keep and bear arms away.
[00:33:55.165 --> 00:33:57.426]  That's the great goal of tyrants throughout history.
[00:33:58.046 --> 00:34:00.327]  And so the Democrats then got arrogant.
[00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:01.527]  They had their big marches.
[00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:07.589]  The Department of Education basically took the streets in all 50 states.
[00:34:08.908 --> 00:34:10.790]  Hauling with them the few children they have.
[00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.352]  That's why less than 10% were actually below the age of 18.
[00:34:14.293 --> 00:34:16.195]  And they announced that they want an end to the First Amendment.
[00:34:16.896 --> 00:34:18.557]  They announced they want Infowars banned.
[00:34:18.898 --> 00:34:20.539]  They announced they want Trump dead.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.761]  They announced they want gun owners dead.
[00:34:22.781 --> 00:34:24.783]  They announced that we're shaking in our boots.
[00:34:25.124 --> 00:34:29.108]  They announced that we're scared to debate them, when it's actually they that are scared to debate us.
[00:34:29.988 --> 00:34:31.210]  It is incredible.
[00:34:32.185 --> 00:34:35.426]  And it blew up in their little authoritarian faces.
[00:34:36.346 --> 00:34:37.886]  It blew up in their limbing faces.
[00:34:38.366 --> 00:34:44.248]  And now poll numbers have Trump and Republicans 5 to 15 to 20 points ahead.
[00:34:44.508 --> 00:34:51.470]  And that's even with skewed CNN polls where they sample 25% or 20% depending on the poll.
[00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.110]  More Democrats than Republicans.
[00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.310]  Trump is well above 40%.
[00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.431]  So you know that's 60%.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.901]  And it's the same thing in Gallup and others where, you know, he was 45, now he's 55.
[00:35:03.222 --> 00:35:14.826]  It's amazing to see this blow up in their face in hundreds of different polls that are different variants and different breakdowns of the same disinformation.
[00:35:15.326 --> 00:35:20.988]  Because you see, even with fake polls, they can't just keep lowering it and lowering it and lowering it.
[00:35:23.191 --> 00:35:25.593]  Because there's only so many numbers they can lower.
[00:35:26.013 --> 00:35:27.314]  People won't buy into it anymore.
[00:35:27.714 --> 00:35:30.095]  And so their main thing is the oversampling of Democrats.
[00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:33.918]  But when Trump goes up and up and up, they still have to show that it's going up and up and up.
[00:35:34.218 --> 00:35:42.623]  They try to have it down there at 35-40% to create the illusion that you're losing, that we're going to collapse, that it's all over, as they try to demoralize us.
[00:35:42.643 --> 00:35:43.344]  But it's not working.
[00:35:45.445 --> 00:35:46.926]  So I've said, David Hogg,
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.381]  With that evil little snickering face.
[00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:51.981]  They're scared of us.
[00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:53.382]  They're shaking in their boots.
[00:35:54.922 --> 00:35:56.643]  Folks up there saying, we're gonna get your guns.
[00:35:56.703 --> 00:35:59.404]  That has now blown up spectacularly.
[00:36:00.204 --> 00:36:00.804]  And here's the thing.
[00:36:02.244 --> 00:36:04.225]  We have a right to defend ourselves.
[00:36:07.786 --> 00:36:08.726]  We have a right.
[00:36:10.987 --> 00:36:11.707]  As citizens.
[00:36:12.268 --> 00:36:13.488]  That's what this country is founded on.
[00:36:13.528 --> 00:36:14.268]  It's our ethos.
[00:36:16.429 --> 00:36:16.569]  And
[00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:31.347]  You can't then have holier-than-thou students, because they survived a government stand-down, and another Prozac head, thank God they did, then project onto us that we victimized them and we're guilty!
[00:36:31.827 --> 00:36:44.497]  We shouldn't just not put up with that, we should be angry when a Nazi collaborator, George Soros and the Democratic Party, go and organize that, and then armed men and the National Guard protect their free speech, which I'm all for,
[00:36:46.735 --> 00:36:53.979]  While David Hogg's supporters and CNN and ThinkProgress and the Daily Mail and all of them come out and say, why is InfoWars still up?
[00:36:55.119 --> 00:37:01.202]  He already said none of the kids died and lied about David Hogg and tried to bully him and tried to debate him.
[00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:05.064]  And I'm reading this stuff in all these newspapers last night and today, none of it's true.
[00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:08.554]  Everybody knows it's David Hogg calling me names.
[00:37:08.774 --> 00:37:11.656]  Everybody knows it's him saying, let's debate, and then not doing it.
[00:37:11.956 --> 00:37:18.120]  Everybody knows they took down our YouTube videos of other students saying that there was a stand down, which we now know.
[00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:19.842]  That's why they took our videos down.
[00:37:22.863 --> 00:37:26.566]  But see, we had a platform to sit here and actually play the videos, and so YouTube had to put them back up.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.620]  And now they're just in a tizzy.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.922]  I got a stack of news here saying we want Alex Jones banned and we want him banned right now.
[00:37:35.562 --> 00:37:38.623]  And we've got Don Lemon CNN admits to using students as human shields.
[00:37:39.243 --> 00:37:43.284]  They say you should not be allowed to criticize these victims and these survivors.
[00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:44.605]  So isn't that perfect?
[00:37:45.005 --> 00:37:49.586]  You've got people who are selectively picked because they're anti-gun and their parents are anti-gun.
[00:37:49.826 --> 00:37:52.327]  They're foisted out at high-tech promotion.
[00:37:53.732 --> 00:38:05.782]  They go all over the country on private jets, they bust in all these people, and then I'm not supposed to be able to say, wow, they're calling to take our free speech, they're calling to take our guns, they're calling to take so many of our rights.
[00:38:06.263 --> 00:38:07.124]  This is dangerous.
[00:38:10.787 --> 00:38:11.888]  And then they had all the headlines.
[00:38:18.598 --> 00:38:20.359]  They say Jones must be shut down.
[00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:21.199]  Here it is.
[00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:31.383]  Outrageous right-wing websites compare Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg to Hitler after sick videos emerge of his March for Our Lives speech dubbed with the Nazi leader's voice.
[00:38:32.303 --> 00:38:37.165]  No, it compares Nazi youth rallies to this being funded by a Nazi collaborator.
[00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:42.987]  There isn't a jury in the world that would, in a defamation case, say you can fairly make those comparisons.
[00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.348]  Plus, they're all public figures.
[00:38:46.772 --> 00:38:47.412]  Then it goes in.
[00:38:47.712 --> 00:38:53.175]  The far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones played one of the videos on InfoWars on Tuesday saying it was truly frightening.
[00:38:53.815 --> 00:38:56.356]  And what I said is I don't think he's a Nazi.
[00:38:56.436 --> 00:39:00.838]  I don't think, you know, he's wearing armbands and going with fascist iconography, David Hogg.
[00:39:01.878 --> 00:39:11.842]  But I said you can't lie about the parallels of authoritarianism and youth marches from the communists in China to Hitler and Germany that that's what they do and they use youth movements to take over.
[00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.890]  Here's another one.
[00:39:14.371 --> 00:39:18.354]  YouTube's warnings didn't deter Alex Jones from attacking Parkland survivors.
[00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:36.009]  Think Progress, another yellow journalism fraud, lies and says I said nobody died, that they were actors, crisis actors, lies and says all the regular stuff, and then says Jones needs to be taken off for targeting and harassing students and saying they're Nazis.
[00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:36.670]  Well, you know what?
[00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.951]  I didn't say they were Nazis.
[00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:42.417]  I said you could clearly see the parallels of youth movements and all the rest of it.
[00:39:43.018 --> 00:39:46.399]  And the left does use racial identification to control people.
[00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:49.020]  So that's race-based.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.940]  Look at the Democratic Party.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.761]  But let's play a clip.
[00:39:53.682 --> 00:39:55.882]  Derry McBrain put this together in 30 minutes this morning.
[00:39:56.142 --> 00:39:57.723]  You could have 10 hours of this.
[00:39:58.223 --> 00:40:04.926]  Everybody knows that they say if you make an OK sign, like the black guy would make in the Sprite commercials when I was a kid.
[00:40:05.933 --> 00:40:06.834]  That he's a racist too?
[00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:07.815]  Okay!
[00:40:08.576 --> 00:40:10.338]  Means, hey, this is, how's that food?
[00:40:10.818 --> 00:40:11.759]  Oh, chef, mmm.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.965]  Like, if you kiss the fingers, that's universal, like, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah.
[00:40:17.305 --> 00:40:22.010]  I mean, in Italy, in France, everywhere, that's muah, muah, bon appetit, muah, muah, muah.
[00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:24.653]  And your hand goes up like, this is incredible!
[00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:25.915]  That, it doesn't matter!
[00:40:26.115 --> 00:40:27.837]  They want to take every symbol and say it's racist.
[00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:33.390]  We'll vote on or before the 12th for Donald J. Trump for President!
[00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.790]  Thank you.
[00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.730]  That was Saturday at a rally in Florida.
[00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:07.652]  Trump was asking supporters to raise their hands, vowing to vote for him in the March 15th primary.
[00:41:07.712 --> 00:41:13.953]  But that led to headlines like these, where some compared that moment to something that might have happened at a rally in Nazi Germany.
[00:41:14.294 --> 00:41:16.494]  We all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940.
[00:41:17.134 --> 00:41:19.595]  We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[00:41:19.975 --> 00:41:23.856]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[00:41:24.836 --> 00:41:28.037]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:32.078]  But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[00:41:32.198 --> 00:41:41.180]  So I had one of Hitler's speeches translated into English, and I think this tells us a lot about where Donald Trump is getting his ideas.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.821]  Look at this Hitler speech, and we've translated it for you.
[00:41:44.641 --> 00:41:45.181]  Thank you!
[00:41:45.641 --> 00:41:46.041]  Thank you!
[00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:47.862]  We're gonna make Germany great again!
[00:41:49.562 --> 00:41:50.723]  That I can tell you!
[00:41:50.823 --> 00:41:51.704]  Believe me!
[00:41:52.044 --> 00:41:56.908]  So when people ask why you support Donald Trump, you just tell them.
[00:41:57.229 --> 00:42:00.331]  He's going to take our economy from here to here.
[00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.473]  I don't like that.
[00:42:02.493 --> 00:42:08.198]  My understanding is you want to clear the air because you think you're being unfavorably compared to Donald Trump.
[00:42:09.299 --> 00:42:10.500]  Don't get me wrong, Conan.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.001]  I agree with a lot he says.
[00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:12.661]  A lot.
[00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:14.803]  Like 90% of what he says.
[00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:16.425]  I'm like, this guy gets it.
[00:42:18.052 --> 00:42:21.978]  But it's just... I don't like the way he says it.
[00:42:22.038 --> 00:42:24.201]  It's just... It's crass.
[00:42:24.281 --> 00:42:25.082]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.925]  Trump is very, very crass.
[00:42:26.985 --> 00:42:27.225]  Yeah.
[00:42:27.706 --> 00:42:33.915]  So imagine if I dress up in a Hitler outfit and then I come on my own show and get interviewed, say, by David Knight.
[00:42:35.772 --> 00:42:41.136]  And I say that I'm Hitler, and I endorse David Hogg, and I endorse George Soros.
[00:42:42.116 --> 00:42:43.157]  They would have complete heart attacks.
[00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:44.638]  You know, I think I may actually do that.
[00:42:44.998 --> 00:42:51.722]  Because that's the sick, evil left, where they think they've got free speech, and they've got satire, but no one else does!
[00:42:51.762 --> 00:42:52.823]  They're a bunch of bullies!
[00:42:53.423 --> 00:42:55.144]  And they are like Hitler!
[00:42:55.365 --> 00:42:56.305]  They are the threat!
[00:42:56.625 --> 00:43:00.808]  They are the enemy, and they want our guns, so they can kick our eyeballs in!
[00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:03.910]  There is an issue.
[00:43:05.546 --> 00:43:15.992]  There is a movement, there is a phenomenon, taking place right now, that is the number one issue on this planet.
[00:43:17.153 --> 00:43:20.115]  Not just for humanity, but for all life forms.
[00:43:22.136 --> 00:43:34.364]  Now I've been on air more than 23 years, but only now, studying how we're attacked by mainstream media, and by globalists, and by major governments, do I understand the whole
[00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:36.110]  Continuum.
[00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:37.291]  The ballgame.
[00:43:39.092 --> 00:43:51.543]  So this is some of the most important information you're ever going to hear here, and it's up to you, if you care about yourself and your family, and if you're conscious, if you're not an animal, as the globalists think you are, if you're not dead inside, to listen to me.
[00:43:53.845 --> 00:43:58.489]  I noticed in the last decade the number one thing mainstream media will attack me for
[00:43:59.716 --> 00:44:07.701]  Is when I talk about how the human species, through fluoride and through atrazine and through thousands of other chemicals, is being changed.
[00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:12.564]  Our IQs are being lowered, our sexuality is being confused, our fertility is being destroyed.
[00:44:12.584 --> 00:44:13.505]  And it's a fact.
[00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:26.152]  And I just noticed in the last few years, with all the late night comedy shows and all the Comedy Central shows and the newspapers, 80% of the attacks, including two in the last 24 hours,
[00:44:27.845 --> 00:44:38.341]  Are when I show people Berkeley and Harvard and Princeton and Yale and Cambridge and all these groups.
[00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:48.708]  They're saying the manipulation of the genetics and the hormones, the sexuality of amphibians and fish and mammals and everything is out of control.
[00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:55.893]  Amphibians are collapsing, fish are collapsing, they are asexual or bisexual or they are deformed.
[00:44:57.414 --> 00:45:04.580]  The male frogs, just under a little bit of atrazine, go over to the male frogs, their olfactory's changed, try to have sex with them when they can't, they're dying.
[00:45:05.632 --> 00:45:13.699]  And we would cover that and they would attack it and say we said it when I was actually holding up mainline journals saying it's making the frogs quote gay.
[00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:16.922]  You know, using that term to get people to look at it.
[00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:22.527]  And then I look, just last 24 hours, David Hogg, the spokesperson for gun control,
[00:45:23.912 --> 00:45:33.455]  And, you know, shows with Stephen Colbert and Thomas Middleditch claiming that I'm attacking him for being a beta male when they had a big magazine cover saying the triumph of the beta male.
[00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:36.116]  I was saying they're mainlining and pushing the beta male.
[00:45:36.416 --> 00:45:39.717]  I wasn't attacking Mr. Middleditch or Mike Judge, who's a good friend of mine.
[00:45:39.777 --> 00:45:41.397]  I think Silicon Valley is a really funny show.
[00:45:42.078 --> 00:45:49.160]  I was just saying the media is pushing all this and then misrepresenting what I've said because they don't want you looking at it.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:46:07.177]  They don't want you researching it, because the additives and the chemicals and the whole deal is in the UN UNESCO founding documents in 1947, the same year we got the National Security Act, to carry out this eugenics transhumanist operation.
[00:46:07.577 --> 00:46:10.840]  For example, on Infowars, one of his most famous statements was saying that
[00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:14.564]  Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and it'll turn you gay too.
[00:46:14.644 --> 00:46:16.225]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[00:46:16.365 --> 00:46:17.767]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:46:18.047 --> 00:46:22.151]  Alex Jones said, The globalists are teaching us to turn off our life force.
[00:46:22.971 --> 00:46:29.698]  It's a camouflage so the alpha males that are still left don't notice they're being taken control of and being enslaved.
[00:46:29.878 --> 00:46:30.198]  Yeah.
[00:46:30.939 --> 00:46:31.539]  Is this true?
[00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:32.680]  Is this true, Moptown?
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.302]  Are you enslaving the alpha males?
[00:46:34.462 --> 00:46:36.384]  Because you know I consider myself a bit of an alpha male.
[00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:36.884]  Oh really?
[00:46:37.625 --> 00:46:40.168]  Do you want to debate it or just let them make a big joke out of it?
[00:46:40.468 --> 00:46:43.371]  Because they're scared of us having a discussion.
[00:46:43.631 --> 00:46:47.735]  And I didn't realize this was the heart of their operation until they attacked me so hard.
[00:46:48.156 --> 00:46:54.582]  Almost all their attacks every day are based on this because they want you to not look around you and see what's happening.
[00:46:55.143 --> 00:46:57.325]  What do you as viewers and listeners think we should do?
[00:47:06.371 --> 00:47:09.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:28.461]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:29.782 --> 00:47:30.662]  Or defend free speech?
[00:47:32.443 --> 00:47:33.883]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:34.123 --> 00:47:35.184]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:35.784 --> 00:47:40.565]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:54.949]  I gotta tell ya, Trump really suckered him again, and I was told this, but I still, the audience gets mad, I get mad, I'm just such a straight shooter that I don't play Machiavellian games.
[00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:56.650]  I can get them, I can study them,
[00:47:57.737 --> 00:48:05.664]  But then, with Trump, I don't really have my radar going for that, and he really suckered the Dems in to admit they want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:48:06.225 --> 00:48:09.448]  Remember Feinstein about a month ago, like rubbing her hands together like a witch?
[00:48:09.468 --> 00:48:10.169]  Can we pull that up?
[00:48:10.987 --> 00:48:13.269]  And he's like, listen, put it all on the table, whatever you want.
[00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:14.709]  Hey, it's all on the table, let's do it.
[00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.631]  May not pass, but whatever you want on the table, sure.
[00:48:18.292 --> 00:48:20.033]  And I got that he was neutralizing him.
[00:48:20.113 --> 00:48:27.138]  I talked to Ted Nugent a few days later, talked to some congressmen about my conversation with Ted Nugent, confirmed what went on in meetings.
[00:48:27.818 --> 00:48:39.566]  And the Dems are so delusional, they didn't know they were sitting right next to him in that meeting when she was rubbing her hands together like a giant rat, that he was baiting them to come out and say what they really wanted.
[00:48:40.743 --> 00:48:44.444]  And now the Republicans have gained on average 15 points.
[00:48:44.664 --> 00:48:48.465]  This is unbelievable that they came out.
[00:48:48.505 --> 00:48:50.265]  But listen, they're stealing elections everywhere.
[00:48:50.505 --> 00:48:52.966]  They're throwing more money than ever at these special elections.
[00:48:53.546 --> 00:48:54.847]  And we are in the fight of our lives.
[00:48:54.927 --> 00:48:56.907]  So I don't want to be too confident here.
[00:48:57.747 --> 00:49:00.028]  But I was talking to Paul Watson last night and today.
[00:49:00.048 --> 00:49:00.648]  I agree with him.
[00:49:01.248 --> 00:49:02.408]  All the intel checks out.
[00:49:03.709 --> 00:49:08.750]  I just don't know if I like Trump intellectually and culturally and politically.
[00:49:10.071 --> 00:49:13.572]  Going along with them on the surface to sucker them in.
[00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.374]  What was the clip?
[00:49:17.394 --> 00:49:17.934]  It was about a month ago.
[00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:18.774]  It was a press conference.
[00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:21.955]  It was one of those deals around the big brown table at the White House.
[00:49:23.156 --> 00:49:23.816]  In the West Wing.
[00:49:24.835 --> 00:49:26.237]  And Feinstein sitting next to him.
[00:49:26.737 --> 00:49:27.178]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:28.199]  There she is rubbing her hands together.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.580]  Back that up.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.122]  I want to play that from about a minute ago.
[00:49:31.442 --> 00:49:31.843]  Here a minute.
[00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:35.066]  Because these people just do not even get it.
[00:49:35.106 --> 00:49:36.508]  That's how delusional they are.
[00:49:36.908 --> 00:49:39.471]  But what you get with Trump is something different.
[00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:44.196]  Now the budget started denting my confidence because I know it's not a budget.
[00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:44.937]  The omnibus.
[00:49:44.977 --> 00:49:46.739]  But it's 12 spending bills a year.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.604]  An omnibus is combining two or more and I don't like what's in there.
[00:49:52.624 --> 00:49:54.005]  But he was given it by Congress.
[00:49:54.205 --> 00:49:55.026]  He says it's horrible.
[00:49:55.206 --> 00:49:55.966]  He says they did it.
[00:49:56.507 --> 00:50:00.670]  He's going to hold up all the spending and have a government shutdown and then get the blame for that?
[00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.712]  He understands how precarious our economy is.
[00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:06.195]  It was the lesser of two evil choices.
[00:50:06.675 --> 00:50:09.377]  Because he's not a dictator and he doesn't need to be a dictator.
[00:50:09.637 --> 00:50:12.259]  The point is he doesn't have total control.
[00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:16.503]  So my gut is I have confidence in Trump.
[00:50:17.759 --> 00:50:19.441]  But he doesn't have total control.
[00:50:20.402 --> 00:50:22.844]  Now, the Russia thing, I'm going to get into that a little bit more next hour.
[00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:29.831]  Mattis gave a press conference bragging about bombing those Russians a few months ago, calling them mercenaries, saying they're lucky we don't kill more.
[00:50:30.252 --> 00:50:39.621]  When they went in there and cleaned out ISIS and Al-Qaeda that Obama put in charge, shame on the White House going down this road to try to dip Mueller.
[00:50:40.618 --> 00:50:41.759]  Mueller's full of crap!
[00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:42.600]  Excuse me.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.600]  It's a family show.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.381]  I'm serious, though.
[00:50:44.861 --> 00:50:46.482]  So this is getting dangerous, folks.
[00:50:46.923 --> 00:50:47.883]  And China's the threat.
[00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:53.087]  They got a 40-ship task force threatening our ships, claiming control of the South China Sea.
[00:50:53.748 --> 00:50:56.090]  That's what Japan started World War II with, that type of stuff.
[00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:05.216]  So, China is in control of our telecommunications control grid that controls all the numbers.
[00:51:05.777 --> 00:51:06.717]  EMS, everything.
[00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:08.737]  I told you about that years ago.
[00:51:08.797 --> 00:51:11.358]  It's finally in the news, only because we have Trump in there.
[00:51:11.678 --> 00:51:12.718]  That's the problem!
[00:51:12.918 --> 00:51:17.880]  If the Russians were in control of our telecom switching keys, I'd be going crazy!
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.901]  Apple has given their code keys last month to communist China.
[00:51:25.121 --> 00:51:25.522]  Reuters!
[00:51:26.902 --> 00:51:28.502]  I've had top experts on.
[00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:30.923]  They said, yes, it's the keys to the kingdom!
[00:51:32.398 --> 00:51:33.458]  You know the movie Elysium?
[00:51:33.758 --> 00:51:35.559]  When they get the root key for the space station?
[00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.920]  He goes, he's got the keys to the kingdom!
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.660]  That's what it is!
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.360]  This is insane!
[00:51:44.521 --> 00:51:48.142]  Because there was a global alliance made in the 70s and 80s with the globalists.
[00:51:48.902 --> 00:51:58.345]  Between China, to give them the Panama Canal, to give them everything, to give them control of the deepwater ports, to give them access to our telecoms, everything.
[00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:01.006]  And you know, one of the crew,
[00:52:02.045 --> 00:52:03.346]  Was making a great point, Harrison.
[00:52:03.966 --> 00:52:06.027]  And I saw this in the news at the time, I didn't think to make a point.
[00:52:06.828 --> 00:52:09.989]  Our rockets come back down and land, the boosters.
[00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:17.293]  You know, envisioned by Jules Verne 130 years ago, now it's real.
[00:52:18.774 --> 00:52:20.935]  They launch their rockets, can't even do it from the ocean.
[00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:23.937]  They don't even launch it out towards the ocean with a trajectory so people are safe.
[00:52:24.137 --> 00:52:29.460]  They just shoot them straight up, and then the big boosters fall on people's houses, killing people.
[00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.551]  And the government just goes, they're just people.
[00:52:33.012 --> 00:52:34.653]  That's communist for you.
[00:52:35.073 --> 00:52:45.161]  Children eating, dead dogs in the streets in Venezuela, China with lakes that catch on fire, rivers that catch on fire, rocket boosters that just fall on their cities.
[00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:54.529]  Can you imagine if NASA shot rockets up at a trajectory where it'd fall on top, say, Chicago or L.A.? ?
[00:52:56.428 --> 00:52:57.148]  That's the difference.
[00:52:57.208 --> 00:52:58.428]  The West values life.
[00:52:58.628 --> 00:53:00.909]  And I'm sick of China being defended.
[00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:03.950]  It is the most bloodthirsty, murderous, out-of-control group.
[00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:04.650]  China!
[00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:11.231]  You walk one block out of a rich area, and there are dead bodies on the side of the street.
[00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:15.152]  There are no dogs or birds hopping around because everybody eats them.
[00:53:18.672 --> 00:53:21.073]  And all over the media, China's the answer.
[00:53:21.113 --> 00:53:21.933]  China's great.
[00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:22.793]  China's this.
[00:53:22.893 --> 00:53:24.594]  China, China, China, China, China.
[00:53:25.394 --> 00:53:25.994]  Our rockets
[00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:32.222]  Come back down and land vertically, like something out of science fiction.
[00:53:32.863 --> 00:53:34.804]  Theirs just rained down on their people.
[00:53:35.385 --> 00:53:36.966]  They could go out to an island and do it.
[00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.748]  They could go and aim it at a trajectory.
[00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:40.970]  But see, it gets better boost if it goes straight up.
[00:53:42.471 --> 00:53:43.992]  That's why we have it at Cape Canaveral.
[00:53:44.193 --> 00:53:46.715]  That's why we launch our rockets over the ocean.
[00:53:47.215 --> 00:53:50.978]  And then we clear the ocean out, so in case it does fall, it doesn't kill anybody.
[00:53:51.859 --> 00:53:54.862]  And now we have rocket boosters that come back down and land on the ships.
[00:53:57.492 --> 00:53:59.395]  And see how innovation makes everything we do better?
[00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.900]  That's not how the CHICOM operates!
[00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:05.263]  Let's have a heavy booster that the U.S.
[00:54:05.303 --> 00:54:13.616]  government gave them under Bill Clinton takeoff with ICBM technology and then just have big old giant booster pieces come crashing down killing people!
[00:54:14.977 --> 00:54:21.479]  Bernie Sanders, I want a vacation in China and I had my honeymoon in Russia in 1971.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.440]  These are demons!
[00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:29.301]  Big selfish pig creatures!
[00:54:33.082 --> 00:54:35.163]  Oh my God, help me from these people!
[00:54:36.587 --> 00:54:40.389]  Anyways, don't criticize David Hogg or we'll have you banned.
[00:54:40.429 --> 00:54:42.730]  And then, I'm not exaggerating, I couldn't even read them all.
[00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:46.352]  It was over a hundred articles last night saying, ban me.
[00:54:46.593 --> 00:54:48.273]  When is YouTube gonna ban Jones?
[00:54:48.474 --> 00:54:55.217]  He said David Hogg isn't a student there and nobody died and that David Hogg's Hitler.
[00:54:55.237 --> 00:54:57.999]  He didn't say any of that.
[00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:02.271]  But you guys calling for trying to ban us, that is Hitler!
[00:55:02.511 --> 00:55:05.953]  You degenerate, tortious, interfering scum!
[00:55:06.353 --> 00:55:07.113]  Shame on you!
[00:55:07.353 --> 00:55:19.340]  And anybody that reads crap like that, when you're reading Daily Mail and ThinkProgress and all this other crap, where they're like, YouTube's warnings didn't deter Alex Jones from attacking Parkland survivors, when is he gonna be banned?
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.921]  He's a horrible person, we want him taken down right now!
[00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:24.723]  He's a bad person, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!
[00:55:26.385 --> 00:55:32.968]  And then ThinkProgress has the nerve to say, ThinkProgress is being targeted by ad networks for producing controversial political content.
[00:55:33.648 --> 00:55:41.351]  And then they go on to say, please help us because we're having our advertising cut, when they're the ones running around trying to cut conservative and nationalistic and Christian speech.
[00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:51.415]  These are classic, flaming authoritarians whose chief is a bizarre 89-year-old Dr. Evil Nazi collaborator.
[00:55:52.369 --> 00:55:57.451]  And then they get Anderson Cooper and Cenk Uygur and all these guys to go on the news and say Jones is a liar.
[00:55:58.872 --> 00:56:01.092]  George Soros is a Holocaust survivor.
[00:56:01.993 --> 00:56:03.873]  Now they're saying he fought the Nazis.
[00:56:04.134 --> 00:56:05.054]  I joked and said that.
[00:56:05.094 --> 00:56:06.955]  Now they're, he fought the Nazis.
[00:56:07.175 --> 00:56:13.037]  No, he went on 60 Minutes and admitted he helped round up thousands of Jews and steal their money for the Nazis and kill them.
[00:56:15.778 --> 00:56:17.919]  But don't worry, Cuomo came out today.
[00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:21.962]  And he said, nobody's trying to take your guns.
[00:56:22.182 --> 00:56:23.522]  These aren't the drugs you're looking for.
[00:56:23.582 --> 00:56:24.043]  Move along.
[00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:26.684]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:56:26.704 --> 00:56:27.264]  We're going to win.
[00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:29.185]  We're going to come back, open the phones up, give it some gas.
[00:56:29.205 --> 00:56:30.645]  It's a ton of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:56:30.665 --> 00:56:31.625]  There's so much to get to.
[00:56:31.745 --> 00:56:33.346]  Oh, the Facebook stuff, all of it's coming out.
[00:56:33.406 --> 00:56:33.986]  It's amazing.
[00:56:34.026 --> 00:56:35.067]  The Islamic takeover.
[00:56:35.087 --> 00:56:35.907]  I'm going to break that down.
[00:56:36.167 --> 00:56:36.927]  But we're on the march.
[00:56:36.967 --> 00:56:37.668]  The empire knows it.
[00:56:37.768 --> 00:56:38.928]  I haven't plugged it this hour.
[00:56:39.468 --> 00:56:44.690]  And it's going to sell out at this rate because we've never combined it with free shipping on top of it.
[00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.131]  50% off our number one bestselling product, Brain Force.
[00:56:47.551 --> 00:56:49.292]  Now 20% more in each bottle of Brain Force.
[00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:49.792]  We're good to go.
[00:57:08.922 --> 00:57:11.204]  Together, they're both 50% off.
[00:57:11.224 --> 00:57:15.168]  Buy them individually, but when you buy them together, it's 50% off and free shipping.
[00:57:15.668 --> 00:57:17.210]  So, do you accept the challenge?
[00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.353]  Brain Force Plus and the Real Red Pill Mind and Body Challenge.
[00:57:20.753 --> 00:57:22.635]  Infowarsstore.com is the main site.
[00:57:22.895 --> 00:57:29.241]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements, books, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration, amazing silver products.
[00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:30.102]  It's all there.
[00:57:30.482 --> 00:57:43.852]  And when you fund us, you absolutely let Soros and CNN and all the anti-free speech, authoritarian, lying scum know they'll never break America's will, they'll never break humanity, and they'll never eradicate Christianity.
[00:57:44.052 --> 00:57:50.937]  And we're just now waking up, and you're in the dustbin of history, and we hate your stinking criminal, slimy, filthy guts, maggots!
[00:57:53.607 --> 00:57:58.331]  We know the media has lied about me since the 1960s because I'm a hunter and I'm a gun advocate.
[00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:05.256]  And more and more people are waking up and getting wiser every day, and they're realizing what this fake news thing is all about.
[00:58:05.296 --> 00:58:10.820]  That's why Donald Trump is such an important guy, because he finally put the spotlight on the fake news cockroaches.
[00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:15.524]  And people are getting smarter all the time, and there's more and more support for truth, logic, and common sense.
[00:58:15.604 --> 00:58:16.745]  We celebrate it every damn day.
[00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:26.631]  I think most of the dirtbags on the left hate me because I'm so damn happy.
[00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:29.932]  I mean, I come out here and I got all these bows and arrows.
[00:58:30.232 --> 00:58:39.855]  I literally come out here every day, and I take a pink arrow with my name on it, and I come out here with Chimane, and we shoot our bows every day.
[00:58:39.915 --> 00:58:41.495]  We go to the range a lot.
[00:58:41.775 --> 00:58:44.896]  If you don't do it, you can learn something from Ted Nugent.
[00:58:44.976 --> 00:58:45.856]  It is the following.
[00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:48.477]  Get yourself a bow and arrow.
[00:58:51.556 --> 00:58:59.483]  And when you are looking at your target, and you're preparing to draw your bow, it goes all the way back to the origins of Zen.
[00:59:01.224 --> 00:59:13.534]  And the mystical flight of the arrow, right here, tunes out everything liberal, everything democratic, and you become the path of your arrow of life.
[00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:16.396]  I just hit the booger I was aiming at.
[00:59:16.576 --> 00:59:17.177]  Look out!
[00:59:17.357 --> 00:59:18.198]  Alex in the hole!
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.381]  And it's real touchy trigger, real touchy.
[00:59:21.401 --> 00:59:21.922]  I understand.
[00:59:22.002 --> 00:59:25.444]  Get that top pin in that top peep and squeeze.
[00:59:25.744 --> 00:59:26.225]  Nicely done.
[00:59:26.365 --> 00:59:29.467]  I'm usually dead on with a bow, but I'm actually sweating because Ted Nugent's watching.
[00:59:29.667 --> 00:59:31.909]  It's like guitars, women, and guns, man.
[00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:33.770]  It's got to be fit for you.
[00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:37.512]  All right, let's see.
[00:59:37.592 --> 00:59:37.873]  Okay.
[00:59:37.953 --> 00:59:41.435]  And just zero that in there and just squeeze that sumbitch.
[00:59:42.936 --> 00:59:43.557]  There you go.
[00:59:43.817 --> 00:59:44.717]  Double lungs, brother.
[00:59:45.058 --> 00:59:45.638]  All right, good.
[00:59:45.658 --> 00:59:46.699]  Back straps have landed.
[00:59:47.324 --> 00:59:48.485]  I'm Ted Nugent, full-time.
[00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.246]  Truth is viral.
[00:59:56.851 --> 01:00:02.075]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:16.983 --> 01:00:21.127]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:30.755]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.762]  Shazia Hobbs is going to join us in the next hour.
[01:00:40.483 --> 01:00:43.746]  She is a former Muslim, lived in Islamic captivity,
[01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:50.514]  She has been critical of Islamic mutilization of women.
[01:00:50.834 --> 01:01:00.320]  They cut the genitals off, cut the... I don't want to even get into it, it's so evil.
[01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:11.048]  The point is, is that you've got all these different Soros-funded globalists, like Linda Sorcerer that leads the Women's March, that now funds the anti-gun march, the march to enslave America.
[01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:21.487]  And when Khan was in town, he read her email like it was harassment, saying Khan should speak out against sexual mutilization, and he acted like someone was threatening to mutilate him.
[01:01:22.547 --> 01:01:23.627]  She got her Twitter banned.
[01:01:24.068 --> 01:01:34.791]  So a woman speaking out against women being put into sex slavery, and their genitals being cut off, their clitoris is being cut off, and she's banned.
[01:01:36.511 --> 01:01:47.760]  And Facebook and Twitter and Google work with Pakistan and others to help report on blasphemers that are either Christian or don't believe in God, and atheists get arrested and executed.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.540]  This is in the news.
[01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:50.442]  And the left loves it.
[01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:55.786]  They're in love with Islam and the men enslaving the women and the women wearing the hoods.
[01:01:55.866 --> 01:02:00.489]  And all over German TV, women wear hijabs now, and they teach the women to wear hijabs.
[01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.512]  There's an article today, Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson, German.
[01:02:05.353 --> 01:02:11.175]  Headmaster tells mother of daughter who was bullied by Muslims to cover up with a hijab.
[01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:19.999]  Because in most Austrian and German schools, in fact nationwide in Austria, half of the children are quote migrants.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.921]  Does that give you the level of the invasion?
[01:02:25.161 --> 01:02:25.481]  Half!
[01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.743]  And the Muslims are like, you're not wearing a hijab.
[01:02:29.843 --> 01:02:31.324]  We're going to beat you up.
[01:02:32.705 --> 01:02:34.146]  We're going to physically assault you.
[01:02:34.226 --> 01:02:35.707]  In many cases, we're going to rape you.
[01:02:36.148 --> 01:02:37.809]  And then what does the head of the Green Party say?
[01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:38.630]  She's a woman.
[01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.752]  She said, stop wearing short miniskirts and wear a bracelet saying, don't rape me.
[01:02:41.772 --> 01:02:42.432]  It was a problem, though, obviously.
[01:02:42.452 --> 01:02:44.414]  The men didn't read German and they didn't care.
[01:02:44.434 --> 01:03:01.547]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[01:03:02.381 --> 01:03:09.163]  And the truth is, the left, like a baby duck, that has been imprinted on its mommy.
[01:03:09.183 --> 01:03:10.063]  You ever seen baby duck?
[01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:12.624]  If its mama's not around when it hatches, it thinks a dog is its mama.
[01:03:12.644 --> 01:03:15.705]  It thinks a person is its, you know, its mama.
[01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:17.505]  And will follow you around for the rest of its life.
[01:03:19.686 --> 01:03:20.806]  Basically worshipping you.
[01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.367]  And it's the same thing.
[01:03:25.407 --> 01:03:26.927]  They imprint them in the schools.
[01:03:27.348 --> 01:03:28.248]  They imprint them
[01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.269]  Hating Christians.
[01:03:30.329 --> 01:03:31.192]  Hating guns.
[01:03:31.293 --> 01:03:32.035]  Hating money.
[01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:32.898]  Hating wealth.
[01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:34.022]  Hating masculinity.
[01:03:34.283 --> 01:03:35.025]  Hating strength.
[01:03:35.366 --> 01:03:36.349]  Hating everything.
[01:03:40.091 --> 01:03:41.711]  Except what is anti-Western.
[01:03:41.992 --> 01:03:48.693]  And it doesn't matter if it's a Stone Age religion, and completely patriarchal, and monotheistic, and everything they say they hate.
[01:03:49.514 --> 01:04:08.539]  If it's allied against the West, and if it's vicious, and if it's muscle, and if it can be used to get the rest of the West to get rid of its rights, to then not antagonize our little visitors, if they can use Western hospitality against us, they can win, and they believe then manage Islam.
[01:04:09.537 --> 01:04:12.658]  Which is like managing a good case of brain cancer.
[01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:23.941]  So I'm gonna open the phones up, and I'm gonna take your calls on this subject, on the Russia escalation, on Facebook.
[01:04:24.321 --> 01:04:28.983]  Microsoft knows that Facebook's been caught breaking in your phone, spying on everything you're doing with AI.
[01:04:29.563 --> 01:04:30.443]  Told you that years ago.
[01:04:32.964 --> 01:04:33.624]  Well guess what?
[01:04:36.645 --> 01:04:38.846]  Microsoft just changed the terms of service, so
[01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:42.218]  You're involved with any Microsoft devices.
[01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:47.583]  They say they have a right to access your hard drives and all your information to make sure you're a good person.
[01:04:48.104 --> 01:04:52.268]  And just like Apple and Droid won't let you send cuss words when you're trying to type them, guess what?
[01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:54.029]  They're not going to let you send emails, nothing.
[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:55.431]  Everything you do is going to be read.
[01:04:55.611 --> 01:05:01.517]  They've already been doing it, but old Bill Gates that doesn't pay any taxes, he's about to slap you upside the head.
[01:05:03.686 --> 01:05:07.128]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:05:07.428 --> 01:05:14.172]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:05:14.472 --> 01:05:19.215]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:05:19.235 --> 01:05:19.755]  It's very simple.
[01:05:19.975 --> 01:05:22.117]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[01:05:22.477 --> 01:05:24.318]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[01:05:24.438 --> 01:05:26.199]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:27.280]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.140]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.964]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:05:36.124 --> 01:05:40.264]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:05:40.565 --> 01:05:44.365]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[01:05:44.405 --> 01:05:47.826]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:51.187]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:54.827]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:05:55.067 --> 01:05:57.368]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[01:05:57.668 --> 01:05:58.368]  It's amazing.
[01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.109]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:18.533]  I'm 1776.
[01:06:18.593 --> 01:06:20.715]  You're a white man!
[01:06:21.216 --> 01:06:25.660]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.481 --> 01:06:27.381]  Move, bitch!
[01:06:27.702 --> 01:06:28.843]  Get out the way!
[01:06:30.564 --> 01:06:33.827]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag
[01:06:38.374 --> 01:06:41.857]  This helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:44.920]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.922]  I will not let you down.
[01:06:47.062 --> 01:06:49.964]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:06:50.164 --> 01:06:51.646]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:06:51.686 --> 01:06:53.768]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:06:53.808 --> 01:06:59.553]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:06:59.593 --> 01:07:01.614]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:02.135 --> 01:07:03.136]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:11.318 --> 01:07:20.555]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:07:20.615 --> 01:07:23.500]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently...
[01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:31.611]  Alex Jones!
[01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:34.112]  Scum!
[01:07:35.713 --> 01:07:36.714]  Russian scum!
[01:07:36.734 --> 01:07:45.079]  The Dolores comes to mind.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.120]  Reputation's amazing.
[01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:48.901]  I will not let you down.
[01:07:49.122 --> 01:07:51.903]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:07:56.713 --> 01:08:01.091]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:08:03.857 --> 01:08:08.901]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:08:09.341 --> 01:08:17.727]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:08:17.867 --> 01:08:29.214]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:08:29.335 --> 01:08:30.876]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:08:31.656 --> 01:08:47.549]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:49.870]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:08:50.331 --> 01:08:56.716]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:01.509]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:07.196]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:25.968]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[01:09:26.108 --> 01:09:30.190]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:36.194]  You've heard people say, you'll have to pry my gun from my cold dead hands.
[01:09:36.654 --> 01:09:37.014]  Okay.
[01:09:39.619 --> 01:09:42.280]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.082]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[01:09:46.242 --> 01:09:50.244]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[01:09:50.284 --> 01:09:55.047]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[01:09:55.107 --> 01:10:01.890]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:02.330]  Enough.
[01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:03.171]  Enough.
[01:10:03.691 --> 01:10:03.971]  Enough.
[01:10:04.071 --> 01:10:05.011]  We say no
[01:10:06.272 --> 01:10:06.752]  More!
[01:10:07.273 --> 01:10:11.134]  Even the presentation during the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.
[01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:16.016]  subjected the participants with know-thy-enemy style exposition.
[01:10:16.036 --> 01:10:16.937]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.237]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:10:18.438 --> 01:10:24.360]  If you try to take our firearms, it doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.821]  We will not relinquish them.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:34.445]  A great example of how the average liberal SJW is so stupid and uneducated on the matters of gun control.
[01:10:34.465 --> 01:10:36.286]  Enough is enough!
[01:10:36.346 --> 01:10:36.786]  Enough is enough!
[01:10:36.806 --> 01:10:38.768]  Not one of them can tell me what they're marching for.
[01:10:39.128 --> 01:10:41.610]  Do you think the Imperials would want to take the guns in Star Wars?
[01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:42.470]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.551]  I hate Infowars.
[01:10:43.571 --> 01:10:45.192]  This is amazing.
[01:10:45.252 --> 01:10:45.813]  This is amazing.
[01:10:46.753 --> 01:10:48.294]  Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:10:48.694 --> 01:10:55.058]  He says that we want your guns, which we do, but you're still insane if you say we do.
[01:10:55.098 --> 01:10:56.739]  I'm quoting from the legislation right here.
[01:10:57.099 --> 01:11:08.006]  The Georgia Bureau of Investigations shall seize and take possession of any assault weapon, large capacity magazine, armor-piercing bullet, or incendiary .50 caliber bullet.
[01:11:08.346 --> 01:11:10.307]  Shall seize and take possession of.
[01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:13.229]  That's not voluntary, that's mandatory.
[01:11:13.349 --> 01:11:14.270]  Do you know what an assault weapon is?
[01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:17.614]  Yeah, it's, um, assault weapon.
[01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:23.299]  It's like, um... I kind of do, but kind of don't.
[01:11:23.339 --> 01:11:26.862]  The same amount of people die by assault weapons as do car crashes in a given year.
[01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:27.923]  As what?
[01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:28.804]  Do car crashes.
[01:11:28.864 --> 01:11:29.705]  It's a similar number.
[01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:30.766]  Okay.
[01:11:31.046 --> 01:11:32.768]  It's not actually, but... Or isn't it similar?
[01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:34.249]  Have you ever fired an AR-15?
[01:11:34.809 --> 01:11:38.072]  Yeah, do you know the difference between an AR-15 and an automatic?
[01:11:38.893 --> 01:11:39.594]  Dead lives.
[01:11:41.377 --> 01:11:43.058]  No, that's not the difference.
[01:11:43.078 --> 01:11:43.578]  You don't know.
[01:11:43.598 --> 01:11:47.520]  An AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.301]  It's no different than a hunting rifle or a handgun.
[01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:51.561]  Worst people out there, man.
[01:11:52.182 --> 01:12:01.866]  Take this and also let it be known that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young kids who are about to be in the voting booths are going to destroy your dreams.
[01:12:01.986 --> 01:12:04.687]  We say no more!
[01:12:05.207 --> 01:12:07.248]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:12:11.292 --> 01:12:13.294]  I tell you folks, these are strange days.
[01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:33.312]  If you just joined us, the big news, depending on the poll, 5 to 20 points, on average about 15 points in national polls, where they sample 10 to 15 to 20 points more for Democrats to skew them, to make it look like Americanism and free market is unpopular.
[01:12:35.424 --> 01:12:40.746]  Despite all that, Trump and Republicans across the country, you can pull the articles up, have surged.
[01:12:41.206 --> 01:12:42.866]  The articles are on Infowars.com.
[01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:45.387]  Again, as much as 20 points.
[01:12:45.907 --> 01:12:50.909]  And suddenly, the Democrats have come out and said, nobody wants your guns, we don't want to take any.
[01:12:50.929 --> 01:12:54.470]  Remember Biden when Obama was first running, going nobody wants your handgun?
[01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:57.811]  Not your shotgun, not your semi-auto, nothing.
[01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:59.431]  We don't want to take any of the guns.
[01:12:59.911 --> 01:13:01.652]  Nobody wants to confiscate any of your guns.
[01:13:02.092 --> 01:13:03.452]  Nobody's coming after your guns.
[01:13:03.872 --> 01:13:07.413]  We understand law-abiding citizens stop way more crime than criminals cause.
[01:13:08.393 --> 01:13:11.834]  And a lot of blue-collar Americans were like, well, I want to vote for that black guy.
[01:13:13.314 --> 01:13:14.455]  I want to bring people together.
[01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:15.355]  I kind of like him.
[01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.715]  He's like a Reagan Democrat.
[01:13:18.176 --> 01:13:19.596]  And it was the very same people.
[01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:20.576]  Look it up.
[01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:21.776]  Just type in.
[01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:23.117]  Even Politico admits it.
[01:13:23.417 --> 01:13:23.977]  The same
[01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:29.966]  White people that voted in Obama are the key demographic that voted in Trump.
[01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:32.027]  And they just want prosperity.
[01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:36.731]  And they just want all the bickering and globalism to stop.
[01:13:38.192 --> 01:13:38.713]  And guess what?
[01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:41.695]  It is starting to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:44.277]  Now we've got big Zuckerberg news coming up in the next segment.
[01:13:44.317 --> 01:13:45.178]  This could bring him down.
[01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:46.059]  This is the biggest ever.
[01:13:46.299 --> 01:13:47.219]  This is really important.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:48.741]  And then we're going to open the phones up.
[01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:53.112]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:53.452]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:13:54.172 --> 01:14:02.594]  And I'm going to be really good today and get to a lot of your calls on the Second Amendment, on where this fight's going, has this killed the blue state wave of 2018.
[01:14:02.894 --> 01:14:06.495]  I think it's put a dent in it, but who knows what they're getting ready to pull again.
[01:14:07.535 --> 01:14:10.776]  We've seen a lot of chainery, a lot of shenanigans.
[01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:11.316]  So, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:11.336 --> 01:14:11.376]  877-789-2539.
[01:14:17.731 --> 01:14:20.613]  First time callers, long time callers, you agree, you disagree.
[01:14:21.534 --> 01:14:27.398]  We're going to take your phone calls on any subject you want to talk about, but the guns are front and center and so much more.
[01:14:28.319 --> 01:14:30.981]  Now, I mentioned this, so I'm just going to play it since I talked about it.
[01:14:31.461 --> 01:14:36.065]  This is Cuomo saying to the Supreme Court Justice, first he hopes that
[01:14:37.871 --> 01:14:45.334]  The former congressman on there doesn't know that all these people like Feinstein and folks are calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment.
[01:14:45.754 --> 01:14:51.537]  And then once he knows what is going on, he then tries to change the subject and say, oh, he didn't really mean that.
[01:14:51.617 --> 01:15:02.001]  No, you guys just take the guns, and every Democrat county and state and city and all these other countries have taken the guns, and the exact same formula and your internal documents say that, but now you're going to lie to us again, Cuomo.
[01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:02.882]  Here it is.
[01:15:03.817 --> 01:15:09.241]  Brother, and you got the President of the United States this morning tweeting that the Second Amendment will never be repealed.
[01:15:09.281 --> 01:15:12.884]  We must have more... Who's calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment?
[01:15:12.904 --> 01:15:13.604]  Who's calling for it?
[01:15:13.624 --> 01:15:14.645]  Justice Stevens did.
[01:15:14.705 --> 01:15:15.286]  He did not.
[01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:18.929]  It was in the context of a conversation about the fastest route to legal change.
[01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:22.231]  And of course, if you didn't have a Second Amendment, you wouldn't have Heller.
[01:15:22.471 --> 01:15:25.273]  It would be easier to change the laws if you were a politician.
[01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:29.076]  Remember, they used to say the Second Amendment wasn't a right to keep mayor arms.
[01:15:29.497 --> 01:15:32.038]  Now the Supreme Court ruled, yes it is.
[01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:35.061]  You can go back to what the founder said, he moron knows.
[01:15:35.581 --> 01:15:43.607]  The war started, Cuomo, because people tried to come take the guns in 1775 at Lexington and Concord.
[01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:49.151]  I understand as a ruling family, your family was back in Italy ruling over serfs and slaves.
[01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.753]  You got that instinct, and I don't want little people having stuff.
[01:15:51.993 --> 01:15:58.338]  A lot of great Italians came over here and wanted to get away from people like you, and now they got a second amendment, whether people like you like it or not, Mr. Cuomo.
[01:16:03.053 --> 01:16:03.377]  Yeah.
[01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.423]  Owen Troyer here for InfoWars.com.
[01:16:14.483 --> 01:16:31.520]  Now, I am at City Council today to discuss an incident that happened on December 10, 2017, where I was trying to go to a memorial march for Kate Steinle, but I was met with armed masked men that prevented me from entering and were intimidating and threatening me.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.281]  I'm going to bring this issue to City Council.
[01:16:33.301 --> 01:16:34.342]  Let's see how they take it.
[01:16:35.066 --> 01:16:37.708]  Alright, well I'm going to start by asking the council a question.
[01:16:37.769 --> 01:16:43.454]  Given everything that's happened in the month of March with the bombings and the police officers saying, if you see anything suspicious, say something.
[01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:49.880]  I think we would all agree that masked men walking around with firearms is something suspicious.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.243]  Now I'm going to play this video for the council to review.
[01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:57.872]  That illustrates that exact thing happening.
[01:16:57.932 --> 01:17:03.735]  Now, I am a firm believer in the First Amendment right, so an individual has the right to walk around with their face covered.
[01:17:04.655 --> 01:17:06.276]  I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment right.
[01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:11.018]  I believe in constitutional carry, so you can carry a rifle or whatever firearm you want with you.
[01:17:11.538 --> 01:17:11.919]  However,
[01:17:12.959 --> 01:17:13.700]  According to U.S.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:37.221]  Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 13, Subsection 241, Conspiracy Against Rights states, if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any state, territory, commonwealth, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised them the same, or two or
[01:17:37.261 --> 01:17:49.568]  More and more persons go in disguise or on the premises of another with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured they shall be fined under this title or in prison not more than 10 years.
[01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:59.462]  Well, on December 10th, the video you're witnessing right now, I went to a memorial march for a deceased victim of a violent crime.
[01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:09.064]  And I was met, as you can see in these pictures, by masked men with arms on their triggers of rifles, battering clubs, etc.
[01:18:09.604 --> 01:18:14.466]  Here you can see this man has his finger on the trigger, keeping me from going to a park
[01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:22.774]  A memorial, here's them, with shields and clubs blocking the entrance from a park for a dead person's memorial.
[01:18:22.814 --> 01:18:27.337]  Now, if that doesn't violate the code, I don't know what does.
[01:18:27.997 --> 01:18:38.505]  And I find it timely that we sit here today with you all discussing getting more funding for police, but I did not hear one person make a suggestion to keep violent criminals off the streets.
[01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:50.572]  Well, maybe if we looked into sanctuary city laws and keeping masked men with guns off the streets, we wouldn't have to have a hundred police officers out there every time somebody wants to have a march, which is every weekend.
[01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:55.574]  Now, I'll just say this in closing and provide an illustration for you.
[01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:16.006]  If I was outside, holding a rifle, keeping people from getting into this city council to state their claim, do you think I should be arrested?
[01:19:16.746 --> 01:19:20.547]  I think everybody here would agree, yes, that should be an arrest.
[01:19:20.907 --> 01:19:21.527]  Absolutely.
[01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:26.488]  But for some reason, and I'm not blaming the APD, because I think they're good men and women.
[01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.629]  Most of my experiences with them have been positive.
[01:19:29.369 --> 01:19:43.901]  But if we're not going to arrest armed individuals with masks, brandishing weapons, intimidating people from their free speech, a clear violation of the law, I just want to know why, and I want to know if this city council thinks that that's the type of city that we should live in.
[01:19:44.121 --> 01:19:44.802]  Thank you for your time.
[01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:45.482]  Thank you.
[01:19:46.623 --> 01:19:51.707]  Mayor, if he would provide us with a link, because I couldn't see that.
[01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:53.569]  Absolutely, I'd be happy to.
[01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:54.450]  Thank you.
[01:20:05.839 --> 01:20:11.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.442 --> 01:20:21.962]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:22.502 --> 01:20:24.343]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:33.164]  Alright, I have opened the phones up for a free-for-all.
[01:20:34.405 --> 01:20:35.505]  In the words of Ted Nugent,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.980]  I got me a rock and roll band, so it's a free-for-all.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.001]  I got me a radio TV show, it's a free-for-all.
[01:20:41.481 --> 01:20:43.781]  So these calls I can see are all over the map.
[01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:46.302]  That should be interesting.
[01:20:46.322 --> 01:20:47.062]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:47.082 --> 01:20:48.762]  Those are coming up in the next segment.
[01:20:49.462 --> 01:21:02.965]  And we have a woman, an Islamic woman, who's no longer Islamic, speaking out against sexual mutilation and being banned off Twitter for criticizing Sadiq Khan's support of it.
[01:21:04.028 --> 01:21:04.869]  You heard me right.
[01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:13.014]  And he came here to South by Southwest and attacked this former Muslim woman who was in captivity, sexually mutilated, you name it.
[01:21:14.616 --> 01:21:24.362]  Speaking out against women, having their... And I see liberals online when we talk about this, making jokes, going, how do you cut a woman's genitals off?
[01:21:24.983 --> 01:21:31.608]  Well, it figures none of you leftists living in your mother's basement would know anything about that, but you need to, you know, you say that to my face, I'm gonna punch you in the nose.
[01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.209]  And I'm serious!
[01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:50.637]  I have three daughters and it's not virtue signaling for me to fundamentally say that you fake feminists leading women into bondage under Islam and all the horrible things you do to women because you want to make sure they end up being alone and having the state as their husband.
[01:21:50.997 --> 01:21:52.417]  You make me sick!
[01:21:53.017 --> 01:21:53.958]  You're a con artist!
[01:21:54.378 --> 01:21:55.058]  You're filth!
[01:21:55.358 --> 01:21:56.198]  You're enemies!
[01:21:57.339 --> 01:22:01.440]  And all your guilt tripping and all your crap doesn't work on me and I just want to see
[01:22:03.595 --> 01:22:07.736]  The spell that's over America and the world broken that you globalists have on people.
[01:22:09.377 --> 01:22:11.758]  Because I feel sorry for people that are under your dominion.
[01:22:13.519 --> 01:22:21.481]  Now I want to hit some biggest news yet on Facebook ever and it's so big that I tend to hold back on news like this just because it's so crazy.
[01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:23.182]  I don't even know how to like
[01:22:27.363 --> 01:22:28.964]  Approach it, because there's so many angles.
[01:22:28.984 --> 01:22:30.125]  I got too many words.
[01:22:30.185 --> 01:22:31.466]  It's just too ridiculous.
[01:22:31.486 --> 01:22:35.669]  And I don't want to just chatter and gibber like I do like some crazy monkey.
[01:22:36.389 --> 01:22:38.951]  And in the background noise, I do.
[01:22:39.071 --> 01:22:39.912]  I mean, I'm the worst at that.
[01:22:39.952 --> 01:22:40.392]  I know that.
[01:22:40.932 --> 01:22:44.795]  All these important topics, and I'm just up here gibbering them off, trying to warn you.
[01:22:45.676 --> 01:22:46.556]  That's all I know to do.
[01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:48.057]  I have faith in you.
[01:22:48.678 --> 01:22:50.539]  But this guy is such a scumbag.
[01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:55.763]  And the people running him are such scumbags, and he's such a...
[01:22:57.171 --> 01:23:05.955]  Fake, grinning, clearly a psychotic psychopath, sociopath, power-tripping, reprobate, soulless person.
[01:23:08.397 --> 01:23:16.841]  And then Facebook is such a soul-sucking creature that it makes me want to throw up.
[01:23:18.882 --> 01:23:20.603]  You see, I just started thinking about Zuckerberg.
[01:23:22.644 --> 01:23:24.705]  And if I don't explain this exactly right, it helps them.
[01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:26.571]  Because that's what they do.
[01:23:26.632 --> 01:23:32.275]  They use their own evil to then get us to go along with new programs to clean up the evil that's actually the full takeover.
[01:23:38.439 --> 01:23:39.640]  Yeah, print me that article, please.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:45.343]  Yeah, the London mayor got urged to lead a campaign on female genital mutilation, but he won't do it because he's an islamicist.
[01:23:45.403 --> 01:23:46.604]  He's a Sharia law guy.
[01:23:47.484 --> 01:23:50.046]  And then the poor woman leading it gets banned on Twitter.
[01:23:50.386 --> 01:23:52.768]  I mean, Twitter's real bad, folks!
[01:23:53.348 --> 01:23:54.509]  These aren't liberals!
[01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:58.731]  It's like, was it Colbert?
[01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:00.872]  A couple of those shows made fun of me last year when I went.
[01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:11.077]  Hillary supported the takeover of Libya and now they've killed 50,000 plus black people because the Wahhabis don't think they're human.
[01:24:11.097 --> 01:24:12.317]  You can look that up.
[01:24:12.958 --> 01:24:15.099]  They have a horrible derogatory term I won't use here on air.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.803]  And they said... Yeah, print me that too, thanks.
[01:24:25.344 --> 01:24:25.824]  Talk to the crew.
[01:24:28.976 --> 01:24:32.661]  And when I talk about Hillary saying, I came, I saw, he died, taking Gaddafi out.
[01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:37.206]  He was working with the West, stabilizing all Africa, spending 99% of his money on the people.
[01:24:37.727 --> 01:24:39.409]  Women were outranking men in college.
[01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:40.610]  Women weren't wearing hijabs.
[01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:41.552]  It was incredible.
[01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:51.277]  Six months after they took over, hundreds of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands of slave women, 50 plus thousand dead Africans admittedly just killed because they're black.
[01:24:52.018 --> 01:24:53.679]  Sexual mutilization.
[01:24:54.139 --> 01:24:55.820]  Mutilization, I'm inventing words like Jesse Jackson.
[01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.882]  Sexual mutilation on a mass scale.
[01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:05.727]  And then they made jokes online going, what's a slave block?
[01:25:07.022 --> 01:25:09.985]  Well, they got a block that you march somebody upstairs.
[01:25:10.045 --> 01:25:11.186]  It's called a slave block.
[01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:12.587]  They've had them since Egypt.
[01:25:13.048 --> 01:25:14.709]  And you sell slaves on top of them.
[01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:19.373]  And they've got antique slave blocks in places like Libya.
[01:25:20.307 --> 01:25:26.331]  And places like Tunisia, and now the Muslims have reopened those markets and are selling women on them.
[01:25:26.571 --> 01:25:42.883]  You got that, you evil, slack-jawed, satanic, fake leftist scum that know we have a conscience, so you manipulate our conscience all day and say, turn your guns in or you hurt the kids, or the West hurts women, and all this crud, when West has empowered women.
[01:25:49.591 --> 01:25:54.073]  You know why women got the right to vote, and why all the women got empowered in the West?
[01:25:55.193 --> 01:26:14.162]  Because the secret religion that predates the globalists and the Luciferian system, and it's not a religion I adhere to, but I understand it and I know it, you can call it the Rosicrucian merger with the British Isles and all beyond, mystery religions, but the West worships women.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:23.963]  And in many other ancient cultures that was the case, but in the West, women are worshipped as the Holy Grail.
[01:26:25.664 --> 01:26:31.426]  And so that's why women got empowered in the West, because they're worshipped in the West.
[01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:42.011]  And you go to British war memorials or US war memorials, and you see a goddess always pointing across the street at a war memorial that'll say, 200,000 dead infantrymen.
[01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:45.072]  There'll be another memorial right next to it, 50-something thousand dead
[01:26:46.744 --> 01:26:47.645]  Uh, artillerymen.
[01:26:47.665 --> 01:26:51.788]  And it'll say, a sacrifice to Britannia.
[01:26:52.548 --> 01:26:59.694]  And Britannia's right across, reaching her hand out at the dead men, and the dead men are a sacrifice to Britannia.
[01:27:02.913 --> 01:27:06.137]  And then, and the Hollywood scum all know this.
[01:27:06.177 --> 01:27:07.539]  They're all devil worshippers, folks.
[01:27:07.739 --> 01:27:08.861]  You think they want to empower women?
[01:27:08.881 --> 01:27:10.142]  They want to throw everybody down.
[01:27:10.403 --> 01:27:13.727]  Families, women, anything strong, anything pure, anything good.
[01:27:14.147 --> 01:27:17.091]  That's their power, is sucking the life force out of women!
[01:27:17.712 --> 01:27:18.773]  Sucking it out of the earth!
[01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:19.874]  Killing the earth!
[01:27:20.575 --> 01:27:37.143]  And then they tell you they are earth worshippers, and they love women, and they want to empower women, and they want to save the earth, when they're the ones trying to create a new artificial intelligence and new life to replace women, to replace the planet, to replace the goddess.
[01:27:37.463 --> 01:27:38.864]  These are satanists!
[01:27:39.104 --> 01:27:40.365]  These are enemies!
[01:27:43.246 --> 01:27:47.388]  Interdimensional borders, whatever you want to call them, they want to kill the planet.
[01:27:49.372 --> 01:27:51.093]  And Hitler hated Christianity.
[01:27:52.815 --> 01:27:53.956]  And Hitler hated God.
[01:27:54.056 --> 01:28:01.942]  And Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:28:02.042 --> 01:28:04.404]  And these are the truths they don't want you to know.
[01:28:06.172 --> 01:28:27.775]  It is the most outrageous fraud, if you know anthropology, sociology, cultural ethos, and this whole system, to sit here and say the West treats women bad when they are boarding us with tens of millions of Islamic military-age men whose religion is debasing and enslaving women!
[01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:35.603]  There's a spirit, and the average leftist has now fully downloaded it.
[01:28:35.703 --> 01:28:39.584]  They are, the average leftist is a dumb, stupid, empty zombie.
[01:28:40.604 --> 01:28:41.384]  They are the enemy.
[01:28:42.365 --> 01:28:45.065]  And they will suck your soul so fast.
[01:28:45.545 --> 01:28:46.586]  Because what's a zombie want?
[01:28:46.626 --> 01:28:48.246]  It wants brains, because it ain't got it.
[01:28:48.546 --> 01:28:49.206]  It's metaphysical.
[01:28:49.226 --> 01:28:51.627]  And we're going to come back with the Zuckerberg news in your calls.
[01:28:51.967 --> 01:28:52.467]  Stay with us.
[01:28:52.547 --> 01:28:53.328]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:53.648 --> 01:28:54.748]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:55.048 --> 01:28:56.108]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:56.468 --> 01:28:57.689]  We are the spear!
[01:28:58.329 --> 01:29:01.810]  With your energy and help and God's will, that will slay the globalists!
[01:29:02.813 --> 01:29:10.500]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:29:11.381 --> 01:29:15.424]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:29:15.945 --> 01:29:18.287]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:29:19.068 --> 01:29:22.191]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:29:23.706 --> 01:29:35.833]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:29:36.533 --> 01:29:51.602]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:29:52.583 --> 01:29:56.310]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[01:29:56.852 --> 01:29:58.575]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:58.595 --> 01:30:00.860]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:30:06.462 --> 01:30:08.224]  William Binney is our guest.
[01:30:08.744 --> 01:30:15.650]  He is the former technical leader of the intelligence with NSA before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 after more than 30 years of the agency.
[01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:19.153]  Binney's been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:23.958]  And again, he is the technical advisor for the film Snowden.
[01:30:24.538 --> 01:30:25.399]  It is so amazing.
[01:30:25.719 --> 01:30:30.643]  Again, this was published today at the Director of National Intelligence website.
[01:30:31.423 --> 01:30:36.347]  William Benny, who's been advising the CIA Director and others, let us know the minute it went out.
[01:30:36.387 --> 01:30:48.616]  This is the secret memo that's so troubling that ties into all the perjury and the cabal of Clinton operatives trying to set the President and others up using the might of the surveillance grid that's meant for foreign powers against the American people.
[01:30:48.756 --> 01:30:50.637]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:30:50.838 --> 01:30:52.419]  William Benny, start wherever you think's best.
[01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:59.472]  I'd like to start with some of the things they're talking about on page 15 of that ruling.
[01:31:00.093 --> 01:31:10.543]  Where they talked about NSA having the authority to go in the Upstream program and take down main communications trunks.
[01:31:12.345 --> 01:31:16.409]  And because I think there's some terrorist or dope dealer on there.
[01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:20.172]  And they can capture and keep the entire trunk line.
[01:31:20.513 --> 01:31:22.535]  Capture all the data and keep it all.
[01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:25.177]  And sort it and interrogate it.
[01:31:25.197 --> 01:31:28.721]  That's basically how NSA analysts are able to look at their lovers.
[01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:29.802]  They're cheating on them.
[01:31:29.822 --> 01:31:30.783]  That's how they can do that.
[01:31:31.243 --> 01:31:32.144]  Under that authority.
[01:31:32.184 --> 01:31:33.405]  But that's all done in secret.
[01:31:33.525 --> 01:31:35.507]  The FISA court is a secret.
[01:31:35.547 --> 01:31:36.768]  They're in their ruling.
[01:31:36.868 --> 01:31:38.010]  This is the upstream program.
[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:40.472]  It's the taps on the fiber lines where they take everything.
[01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:52.650]  And that's really what I was trying to say about President Trump when he was being targeted in all the data they were collecting, including his entire staff on this committee and everything.
[01:31:53.010 --> 01:31:58.773]  They were all being spoofed up in this bulk acquisition off the fiber lines in the Upstream program.
[01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:03.156]  And the main slide that would show it, if you could put it up, is the Fairview program.
[01:32:03.716 --> 01:32:07.718]  That is AT&T's tapping points inside the 48 states of the United States.
[01:32:08.368 --> 01:32:14.453]  And you notice all the tap points are distributed with... This is the one that no mainstream media wants to show on TV.
[01:32:15.014 --> 01:32:19.477]  Because this is the one that calls out this business about they're only after foreigners is an obvious lie.
[01:32:19.658 --> 01:32:28.005]  You know, unless you face them and go after them and do something about this, you're not going to correct the problem in the future and people will look back and say, well, they got away with it, so I'll do it too.
[01:32:28.305 --> 01:32:31.768]  That's why I blamed this all on Jerry Ford when he pardoned Nixon, you know?
[01:32:32.308 --> 01:32:35.050]  When he did that, he said every president can do anything he wants.
[01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:36.871]  He's now got to get out of jail free card.
[01:32:36.892 --> 01:32:40.094]  That's the next president, who also wants to be able to do whatever he wants.
[01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:44.617]  So you see, that was where I put the blame right there with Jerry Ford.
[01:32:44.697 --> 01:32:51.062]  And if he'd have let Nixon go to trial and be indicted, then I don't believe that this would have happened.
[01:32:51.382 --> 01:32:54.564]  But we haven't done any indictments of any of these people who've done similar crimes.
[01:32:54.644 --> 01:32:57.507]  And now, for massive crimes, we haven't done any of that.
[01:32:57.527 --> 01:32:59.088]  And that's really what we need to do.
[01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:09.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.506 --> 01:33:26.693]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:27.133 --> 01:33:32.296]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:44.488]  Alright, I gotta hit the Zuckerberg news quickly, but it's very important that I'm going right to John in Texas, Sam in San Francisco, Jeff in Kansas, Cameron in Florida, Eric in Indiana, Daniel in New York, and a bunch of others.
[01:33:44.508 --> 01:33:51.152]  And then we have a woman being censored because she escaped Islam as criticizing sexual mutilization.
[01:33:51.372 --> 01:33:52.513]  Mutilization.
[01:33:52.713 --> 01:33:53.113]  Say it today.
[01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:54.514]  Normally you don't have a problem with words.
[01:33:54.874 --> 01:33:56.335]  Sexual mutilation.
[01:33:57.537 --> 01:33:58.237]  Just crazy.
[01:33:58.297 --> 01:33:59.277]  So that is coming up.
[01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:01.838]  And this is what Linda Sorcerd thinks is a great thing.
[01:34:01.858 --> 01:34:03.998]  This is who leads the women marches.
[01:34:04.059 --> 01:34:05.159]  It's all an abomination.
[01:34:05.759 --> 01:34:13.121]  Now, before we go any further, I don't like sitting up here and plugging stuff.
[01:34:13.861 --> 01:34:14.901]  They had to tell me to plug.
[01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:16.981]  Most talk shows, as you know, plug every segment.
[01:34:17.001 --> 01:34:20.622]  And I get why they do, because the real place people are listening is not during the ad breaks.
[01:34:20.682 --> 01:34:23.143]  It's mainly during the main broadcast.
[01:34:23.769 --> 01:34:27.571]  So if you tune in to Glenn Beck or somebody, he comes into every segment plugging, out of every segment plugging.
[01:34:28.492 --> 01:34:29.953]  And sometimes whole segments are plugs.
[01:34:31.714 --> 01:34:36.417]  I just bring you great products that I know are game changers, that if you'll try them, you're going to want to keep reordering them.
[01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:42.061]  We have a wide selection of t-shirts, books, films, highest quality water filtration, air filtration.
[01:34:44.437 --> 01:34:49.120]  It's all there, and if you shop with the good guys, InfoWarsTore.com, you built this operation.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.302]  That isn't just like you can halfway feel you're in the fight.
[01:34:52.022 --> 01:34:55.764]  Financing us and getting good products at the same time is a total win-win.
[01:34:56.165 --> 01:35:00.007]  So for all of you on the fence, man, you gotta be filtering your children's water.
[01:35:00.948 --> 01:35:06.452]  And if you like a good, healthy pick-me-up that has all the compounds that are good for your brain, Brain Force is amazing.
[01:35:06.732 --> 01:35:11.475]  The real red pill is a fusion of amino acids, key enzymes,
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:24.905]  Vitamins and minerals with preglanone that is a precursor to all your hormones, and it starts lowering your body after 2025, and then you cannot produce the hormones you need.
[01:35:24.925 --> 01:35:27.306]  So it's not hormone replacement, it is preglanone.
[01:35:27.346 --> 01:35:33.368]  It's very powerful, but with all these other things with it, it helps you upload it, and it's an organic, very strong source of it.
[01:35:33.668 --> 01:35:34.388]  It's not synthetic.
[01:35:35.649 --> 01:35:42.292]  It's 50% off, the real red pill by itself or Brain Force, but get them together, the combo has free shipping.
[01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:44.249]  On top of it.
[01:35:44.529 --> 01:35:46.831]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews for both.
[01:35:47.111 --> 01:35:51.215]  No reviews for the Mind and Body Challenge Pack because we just launched the special yesterday.
[01:35:52.757 --> 01:35:55.839]  At current sales rates, we're getting new Brain Force in about two weeks.
[01:35:55.879 --> 01:35:58.181]  We're getting more Red Pill in about a month.
[01:35:59.322 --> 01:36:01.645]  Red Pill will sell out in a couple weeks at this sales rate.
[01:36:02.045 --> 01:36:04.968]  Brain Force probably by Monday or Tuesday and we'll be out for a week.
[01:36:04.988 --> 01:36:05.348]  That's fine.
[01:36:05.868 --> 01:36:07.890]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off.
[01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:08.491]  I'll explain this.
[01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:13.494]  We just went out and said, what are the top healthy nootropics that are seen by the FDA as safe?
[01:36:13.514 --> 01:36:14.415]  They call it GRASS.
[01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:15.956]  There's a law they passed.
[01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:28.069]  And we looked at a couple top-selling formulas and kind of changed them up and then fused them and then made it stronger and then don't charge you retail 80 and then discount it for $59.
[01:36:30.367 --> 01:36:30.607]  No.
[01:36:31.528 --> 01:36:40.291]  You know, we put $10 a product in something, and then we got marketing, other stuff, and let's say it's costing us $15 a bottle, then we sell it to you for $35 or whatever.
[01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:41.491]  Well, right now, it's $19.95.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.583]  And again, I asked him, I said, why are we going to sell this almost at cost?
[01:36:47.603 --> 01:36:51.827]  He said, because it makes it, people buy all the other products when they're in there, and this just helps fund the operation.
[01:36:51.907 --> 01:36:52.407]  And he's right.
[01:36:52.768 --> 01:36:58.253]  But we're selling it for $19.95, and this is better than stuff that sells for $60 discounted.
[01:36:58.313 --> 01:36:59.354]  I mean, it's good.
[01:36:59.975 --> 01:37:00.875]  And that's our philosophy.
[01:37:00.896 --> 01:37:02.537]  100 to 150% markup, not 5 to 7 times industry standard.
[01:37:06.141 --> 01:37:06.902]  Highest quality.
[01:37:07.222 --> 01:37:08.083]  We know we're under the gun.
[01:37:08.123 --> 01:37:09.124]  They're testing everything we do.
[01:37:09.164 --> 01:37:09.785]  They're watching it.
[01:37:10.045 --> 01:37:12.648]  Plus, I would still have it be the very best.
[01:37:13.408 --> 01:37:15.030]  Even if I knew we weren't being tested and under the gun.
[01:37:16.571 --> 01:37:17.172]  Think about that.
[01:37:17.372 --> 01:37:18.373]  So, BrainForcePlus.
[01:37:18.433 --> 01:37:19.795]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:37:19.915 --> 01:37:21.837]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:37:22.117 --> 01:37:22.738]  Or, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:22.898 --> 01:37:24.459]  And, just try it.
[01:37:24.499 --> 01:37:24.820]  It's great.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.661]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[01:37:25.681 --> 01:37:26.682]  An additional 10% off.

[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.461]  So, and you can cancel anytime.
[01:37:32.641 --> 01:37:35.863]  InfoWorksStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:36.063 --> 01:37:39.185]  But do yourself a favor, support free speech, support this fight.
[01:37:39.565 --> 01:37:46.149]  You know, I'm so thankful to you that when people come up and thank me, I say, please stop it, because I want to hug you.
[01:37:46.169 --> 01:37:47.870]  People are like, hey, I want to take a selfie with my wife.
[01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:48.870]  And you know, I love you.
[01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:49.871]  Your son loves you.
[01:37:50.091 --> 01:37:50.791]  We really appreciate you.
[01:37:50.811 --> 01:37:52.732]  Oh, you're so nice to get up from dinner and talk to us.
[01:37:52.772 --> 01:37:53.753]  I'm like, are you kidding?
[01:37:56.121 --> 01:38:01.524]  I went to Chicken Express and the owner was a listener and he was trying to give me free chicken with my kids driving down to San Antonio.
[01:38:02.324 --> 01:38:03.945]  And I said, bro, I'm going to pay for the chicken.
[01:38:05.025 --> 01:38:08.947]  Thank you for being a listener and just a patriot.
[01:38:11.448 --> 01:38:14.970]  I just keep trying to explain, thank you, thank you, thanks to our affiliates.
[01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.712]  Thanks to everybody that has the courage to carry this broadcast.
[01:38:18.172 --> 01:38:19.512]  This is the real fight for the country.
[01:38:19.532 --> 01:38:20.413]  Without you, we're nothing.
[01:38:20.653 --> 01:38:23.554]  So stop thinking it's about me.
[01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:24.375]  It's about you.
[01:38:26.325 --> 01:38:29.886]  And the products you buy are great products, and they fund our operations.
[01:38:29.906 --> 01:38:31.406]  So check out InfoWorksStore.com today.
[01:38:31.466 --> 01:38:32.667]  Okay, I'm going to your calls.
[01:38:32.687 --> 01:38:33.867]  Just send it to Zuckerberg right now.
[01:38:40.088 --> 01:38:46.310]  The globalists have the power because they're ruthless and we're willing to take over.
[01:38:47.998 --> 01:38:49.239]  But it doesn't mean they're that smart.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:59.267]  And good men and women are humble, so they don't think about themselves being in a position of power, so we go into careers, normal people, that are just about our families and our lives and our passions.
[01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:02.910]  The globalist passion is world domination and total control.
[01:39:04.311 --> 01:39:08.194]  As the Chinese dictator said, we are going to have a bloody war with the U.S.
[01:39:08.274 --> 01:39:09.595]  and we're going to have world domination.
[01:39:09.635 --> 01:39:10.096]  That's a quote.
[01:39:12.432 --> 01:39:16.373]  And that's what the Chinese communists want to hear on their power trip, is we're taking over the world!
[01:39:16.673 --> 01:39:20.094]  They're organized against us, they're allied with the big banks in the U.S.
[01:39:20.794 --> 01:39:21.515]  Trump's fighting that.
[01:39:23.355 --> 01:39:29.357]  Well, Zuckerberg, remember, came out in emails a couple years ago, he said, yeah, I spy on anybody I want.
[01:39:29.777 --> 01:39:34.678]  Girlfriends, alumni, you want anything on anybody on the internet, I'll give you everything about them.
[01:39:35.158 --> 01:39:36.599]  Just talking bragging to other friends.
[01:39:37.742 --> 01:39:39.583]  And they go, well, how do you have everybody's personal data?
[01:39:39.603 --> 01:39:41.745]  He goes, these dumb effers, trust me.
[01:39:42.565 --> 01:39:43.446]  Dumb effers.
[01:39:45.007 --> 01:39:47.189]  Now, think about that.
[01:39:47.369 --> 01:40:07.023]  Now, he was chosen by the Harvard alum and the Harvard mafia and the globalists out of all these different systems to let the media promote him, promote this model that was already out there, so the CIA and others could get databases on everybody, but so they could also make huge amounts of money and let the Harvard alumni, that's what the emails are, there's hundreds of them, spy on everybody else in the Harvard mafia.
[01:40:08.018 --> 01:40:10.762]  So what it is, is an NSA that you opt into.
[01:40:11.924 --> 01:40:15.250]  And it's data mining is bigger than the NSA, many experts are saying.
[01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:16.071]  I'm not sure that's true.
[01:40:17.079 --> 01:40:19.020]  But it's definitely the biggest private data mining out there.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:28.405]  Now, they want to do this Analytica deal that's a mid-sized company compared to others, doing data mining open source, all sorts of weird stuff, bad stuff, you name it, on both sides, working for everybody.
[01:40:28.445 --> 01:40:28.985]  Mercenary group.
[01:40:29.646 --> 01:40:33.828]  Well, once you open it up, of course then people go, well, that's Zuckerberg's main job, it's what he does.
[01:40:34.168 --> 01:40:40.171]  So now he's on the rocks, and now it's come out that they're spying on everybody.
[01:40:41.732 --> 01:40:43.353]  And that they're breaking into your phones.
[01:40:44.284 --> 01:40:47.852]  And that they're downloading all your contacts and then integrating that with other databases.
[01:40:48.132 --> 01:40:49.054]  And it's all illegal.
[01:40:49.535 --> 01:40:51.539]  So what has Microsoft announced yesterday?
[01:40:51.559 --> 01:40:52.641]  And I've got the articles right here.
[01:40:54.265 --> 01:40:55.507]  They've already been doing this too!
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:00.203]  So they put it in the terms of service, just like Samsung did three years ago.
[01:41:00.803 --> 01:41:05.427]  Samsung said, we're watching and listening to everything you do in your house, and we're selling to third parties.
[01:41:05.447 --> 01:41:07.368]  They said, so be careful what you say or do.
[01:41:07.929 --> 01:41:08.429]  Wow.
[01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.450]  Wow.
[01:41:10.231 --> 01:41:12.893]  So Microsoft just saw them tank.
[01:41:13.853 --> 01:41:14.734]  $40 billion dropped out of them.
[01:41:14.854 --> 01:41:16.295]  Amazon just lost $40 billion.
[01:41:17.316 --> 01:41:22.938]  This is all coming out that Trump says you're not going to be tax-exempt anymore, you're not going to get $1.48 on every package from taxpayers.
[01:41:23.598 --> 01:41:24.778]  Oh yeah, it's woodshed time.
[01:41:25.039 --> 01:41:27.819]  Trump's delivering that these folks are trying to shut us down and shut him down.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.200]  And screwing over U.S.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]  taxpayers and consumers.
[01:41:31.401 --> 01:41:34.021]  So, that's in the news, and I've got the articles here.
[01:41:34.582 --> 01:41:35.322]  We'll play this clip.
[01:41:36.343 --> 01:41:38.265]  But remember who told you they were spying on all this?
[01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.647]  Remember who told you this was going on?
[01:41:39.907 --> 01:41:42.530]  Remember I told you about the databases because I had NSA whistleblowers?
[01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:49.177]  So here's Zuckerberg in 2009 on BBC with his little psycho fake eyes and little puppy, little baby seal.
[01:41:49.658 --> 01:41:50.899]  Oh, you own your data.
[01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:52.281]  Oh, we don't share it with nobody.
[01:41:52.341 --> 01:41:52.741]  Oh, no.
[01:41:53.462 --> 01:41:55.784]  He'd already written the emails calling you dumb effer back then.
[01:41:56.738 --> 01:41:59.639]  So let's go to this little psychopath frontman for the CIA.
[01:41:59.679 --> 01:42:00.059]  Here he is.
[01:42:00.659 --> 01:42:03.040]  So who is going to own the Facebook content?
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.960]  The person who puts it there or you?
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:14.363]  The person who's putting the content on Facebook always owns the information and that's why this is such an important thing and why Facebook is such a special service that people feel a lot of ownership over.
[01:42:15.143 --> 01:42:16.203]  This is their information.
[01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:16.764]  They own it.
[01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:17.764]  And you won't sell it?
[01:42:18.484 --> 01:42:19.084]  No, of course not.
[01:42:19.104 --> 01:42:22.587]  I mean, they want to share it with only a few people.
[01:42:22.607 --> 01:42:27.830]  So just to be clear, you're not going to sell or share any of the information on Facebook?
[01:42:28.191 --> 01:42:34.755]  What the terms say is just, we're not going to share people's information except for the people that they've asked for it to be shared.
[01:42:34.775 --> 01:42:36.856]  Edward Snowden put that out last week.
[01:42:37.777 --> 01:42:38.778]  Total sociopath.
[01:42:40.496 --> 01:42:41.878]  I say psychopathic.
[01:42:42.318 --> 01:42:43.720]  But the point is, you look at those eyes.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.281]  I mean, you know it's a predator.
[01:42:45.342 --> 01:42:46.102]  It's looking at you.
[01:42:46.423 --> 01:42:47.264]  How do I scam you?
[01:42:47.504 --> 01:42:48.385]  How do I screw you over?
[01:42:48.505 --> 01:42:49.066]  I'm dominant.
[01:42:49.166 --> 01:42:49.566]  I'm God.
[01:42:49.626 --> 01:42:50.267]  I'm Zuckerberg.
[01:42:50.627 --> 01:42:52.710]  And that's the spirit of the left and all of them.
[01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:57.375]  He's got armed guards, tax exempt, huge compounds in Kauai, helicopters.
[01:42:57.635 --> 01:42:59.077]  But he doesn't want you to have guns.
[01:43:02.705 --> 01:43:08.589]  Cold War's Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[01:43:08.769 --> 01:43:12.531]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were.
[01:43:12.591 --> 01:43:15.092]  What were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[01:43:15.193 --> 01:43:17.014]  And we made it even stronger.
[01:43:17.174 --> 01:43:21.917]  Then we cut the price, because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[01:43:22.257 --> 01:43:22.977]  We only have 150%.
[01:43:23.017 --> 01:43:24.118]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[01:43:25.979 --> 01:43:28.260]  Well now it's 50% off.
[01:43:28.821 --> 01:43:37.206]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[01:43:37.246 --> 01:43:38.747]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[01:43:39.067 --> 01:43:40.448]  But the two go together.
[01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:42.229]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:46.951]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:51.454]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[01:43:51.474 --> 01:43:57.378]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[01:43:57.418 --> 01:44:00.420]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[01:44:18.192 --> 01:44:19.113]  We went out and looked.
[01:44:19.153 --> 01:44:19.713]  What is the top?
[01:44:19.793 --> 01:44:20.333]  What is the best?
[01:44:20.694 --> 01:44:21.914]  We'll just put even more product in.
[01:44:21.934 --> 01:44:22.535]  We'll make it better.
[01:44:22.635 --> 01:44:25.076]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it.
[01:44:25.116 --> 01:44:25.497]  Sell it for $60.
[01:44:26.337 --> 01:44:28.919]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:44:29.399 --> 01:44:31.160]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:34.182]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[01:44:36.423 --> 01:44:38.485]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[01:44:38.785 --> 01:44:42.608]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[01:44:42.628 --> 01:44:46.051]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:44:46.511 --> 01:44:49.434]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[01:44:49.674 --> 01:44:53.076]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[01:44:53.317 --> 01:44:55.619]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[01:44:55.919 --> 01:44:56.599]  It's amazing.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:59.362]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:13.410]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:14.411]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:45:14.451 --> 01:45:15.472]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:45:15.512 --> 01:45:20.496]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:45:20.896 --> 01:45:25.901]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:28.103]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:45:28.903 --> 01:45:30.284]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:45:30.404 --> 01:45:34.046]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:45:34.146 --> 01:45:39.128]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:45:39.508 --> 01:45:44.951]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:45:45.351 --> 01:45:50.554]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:45:50.934 --> 01:45:51.874]  And over and over again.
[01:45:51.934 --> 01:45:58.836]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:45:59.056 --> 01:46:01.256]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:46:01.356 --> 01:46:02.916]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:46:02.976 --> 01:46:16.279]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[01:46:16.299 --> 01:46:16.939]  Fertility is key.
[01:46:17.499 --> 01:46:34.092]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:46:34.472 --> 01:46:38.475]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:46:38.495 --> 01:46:43.940]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying, all of a sudden it was like, boom!
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.601]  Started losing weight, all this energy, I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:54.423]  It's as important as vitamin C. You've got to have vitamin C, you've got to have iodine to live, you've got to have water to live.
[01:46:54.623 --> 01:46:58.104]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine.

[01:47:06.327 --> 01:47:08.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.376 --> 01:47:27.858]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:27.878 --> 01:47:40.041]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls, but since I was mentioning it for radio listeners and TV viewers, let me show you the articles, because I mentioned I had the articles backing up what I was saying earlier, so I'll go over some of them.
[01:47:41.112 --> 01:47:41.533]  Report!
[01:47:42.133 --> 01:47:50.121]  Facebook found Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress how the left turned tech giants into their speech police.
[01:47:50.281 --> 01:47:54.646]  Very important article from the Daily Caller from Peter Haysen.
[01:47:54.786 --> 01:47:56.067]  Very important how they document.
[01:47:58.110 --> 01:48:00.192]  It's not Trump that's got big tech working for him.
[01:48:00.272 --> 01:48:01.233]  It's the globalists.
[01:48:02.682 --> 01:48:05.543]  Microsoft comes for the trolls with offensive language ban.
[01:48:05.903 --> 01:48:08.564]  That's Gizmodo, the whole leftist globalist organization.
[01:48:09.765 --> 01:48:10.965]  Oh, they're coming for the trolls!
[01:48:11.285 --> 01:48:21.149]  And then they tell you, oh, we're going to get in your Xbox, we're going to get in all your computers, we have the right to go into your hard drives when you interface with us to make sure you're not being mean to people, we're going to read everything you're doing, we're going to read your email.
[01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:22.870]  It's just incredible.
[01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:25.531]  Just like they say, it's time to ban Jones off the internet!
[01:48:25.791 --> 01:48:27.172]  He's bullying kids!
[01:48:28.055 --> 01:48:29.416]  No, David Hogg's a public figure.
[01:48:30.117 --> 01:48:33.879]  We're wearing armbands, doing fist salutes, saying they're going to take our rights.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.442]  I'm allowed to say that's a fascistic parallel.
[01:48:39.243 --> 01:48:40.344]  I mean, just on its face.
[01:48:40.524 --> 01:48:41.725]  Sue me if you want to, Hogg.
[01:48:41.745 --> 01:48:42.446]  You probably will.
[01:48:43.446 --> 01:48:43.847]  Let's go!
[01:48:45.468 --> 01:48:49.331]  You're the one calling me names, going after me, saying my family's all this and that and everything else.
[01:48:50.291 --> 01:48:54.475]  By the way, my son told me this morning, he said he wants on air.
[01:48:57.708 --> 01:49:00.393]  You know, his mom had gotten a couple of injunctions for him not to be on air.
[01:49:00.793 --> 01:49:01.855]  We talked to lawyers and everything.
[01:49:01.875 --> 01:49:05.061]  I didn't really buck the judge on that, but they're not really constitutional.
[01:49:05.742 --> 01:49:07.485]  And now you got all these other people that are anti-gun.
[01:49:07.505 --> 01:49:09.970]  Well, why can't my son at 15 be pro-gun?
[01:49:11.408 --> 01:49:14.410]  And so the injunctions are over now, and so he's been going on air.
[01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:15.090]  That's him.
[01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:16.831]  Those pieces is Rex.
[01:49:18.192 --> 01:49:21.073]  I just gave him the advice to be nice, but he doesn't like David Hogg.
[01:49:21.553 --> 01:49:25.255]  He reads all the stuff, them trying to take us offline, them saying stuff about us.
[01:49:25.995 --> 01:49:29.117]  You know, so is my 15-year-old allowed to get in the face of an 18-year-old?
[01:49:30.098 --> 01:49:30.478]  We'll see.
[01:49:32.539 --> 01:49:33.219]  So it's amazing.
[01:49:33.239 --> 01:49:38.402]  But continuing, Cambridge Analytica, Whistleblower, Facebook, able to listen to you at home and work through your phone.
[01:49:39.864 --> 01:49:44.509]  How Facebook was able to collect Android text and phone logs and break into your phone, CBS News.
[01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:48.413]  Facebook faces more heat after call.
[01:49:49.113 --> 01:49:51.476]  Text data scraping of Android devices revealed.
[01:49:54.519 --> 01:49:57.202]  You won't believe how much Facebook knows about you, San Francisco Gay.
[01:49:57.682 --> 01:49:59.324]  Oh, you would have known all about it here!
[01:50:00.754 --> 01:50:04.495]  Years ago, Facebook sued for allowing discriminatory housing ads.
[01:50:05.235 --> 01:50:11.857]  Yeah, for gays, or women only, or... See, the liberals are the ones that discriminate now, because they're the new bosses.
[01:50:12.337 --> 01:50:14.198]  We the bosses, we the bosses.
[01:50:15.358 --> 01:50:15.979]  So I can hop.
[01:50:16.279 --> 01:50:17.599]  It's a really cheesy movie, but it's funny.
[01:50:18.519 --> 01:50:22.180]  And, you know, the chicks take over from the Easter Bunny, and then they set up a tyranny.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.122]  He goes, it is a coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat.
[01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:31.992]  And they're just recreating stuff even worse than what was going on before.
[01:50:32.713 --> 01:50:35.854]  And the real liberals, like myself, are sitting back going, man, you people are out of control.
[01:50:36.955 --> 01:50:39.076]  Facebook sued for long discriminatory housing ads.
[01:50:39.936 --> 01:50:40.137]  Yeah.
[01:50:42.058 --> 01:50:44.619]  And the left's like, well, we can say men are women only or gay only.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.701]  Oh, but if you don't bake a cake, it's 500 grand.
[01:50:48.161 --> 01:50:49.382]  Oh, and you want our free speech ban.
[01:50:49.862 --> 01:50:51.843]  Hey, quit thinking so much of yourself.
[01:50:52.683 --> 01:50:54.905]  I'm not obsessing over what you do with your
[01:50:55.939 --> 01:50:57.139]  The in a sausage or whatever.
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.500]  You know, just, I want my freedom.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.221]  I want it now.
[01:51:00.341 --> 01:51:01.121]  Get out of my way.
[01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:01.721]  Just get out.
[01:51:01.981 --> 01:51:03.782]  I don't want to hang out with you globalists or leftists.
[01:51:03.822 --> 01:51:05.343]  I don't want to hang out with anybody, really.
[01:51:05.483 --> 01:51:06.183]  Just leave me alone.
[01:51:06.443 --> 01:51:07.003]  Leave me alone.
[01:51:07.203 --> 01:51:07.764]  Leave me alone.
[01:51:07.804 --> 01:51:08.324]  Leave me alone.
[01:51:08.344 --> 01:51:11.505]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:51:11.545 --> 01:51:12.605]  I really appreciate everybody calling.
[01:51:12.625 --> 01:51:13.746]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:51:14.706 --> 01:51:15.687]  Who is up first here?
[01:51:15.727 --> 01:51:18.788]  We've got John in the great state of Texas.
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:22.161]  Well I want to talk about this bump stock issue.
[01:51:22.181 --> 01:51:24.122]  Because I think Trump is trying to sucker in the left on the bump stocks.
[01:51:24.822 --> 01:51:29.364]  Because basically the ATF has ruled three different times that these do not turn semi-autos into machine guns.
[01:51:50.413 --> 01:51:54.156]  The law states specifically what a semi-auto is and what a machine gun is.
[01:51:55.096 --> 01:52:02.141]  And plus the commentary, the comment section they had before they started debating on this, that 75% of the people were against it.
[01:52:02.662 --> 01:52:07.425]  So I think he knows that the ATF is going to say, unless they change the law, I'll tell you there ain't nothing we can do about it.
[01:52:09.295 --> 01:52:09.895]  Well that's it.
[01:52:09.975 --> 01:52:12.936]  Trump can't act executive unilaterally on the Second Amendment.
[01:52:13.396 --> 01:52:15.036]  I don't even like him implying he can.
[01:52:15.476 --> 01:52:20.998]  And it's true the ATF keeps trying to arrest people if their AR-15 malfunctions and kind of shoots a few extra shots.
[01:52:21.498 --> 01:52:22.918]  We all know about those famous cases.
[01:52:23.298 --> 01:52:28.739]  And that's them trying to legislate as a bureaucracy, which has been found unconstitutional.
[01:52:29.579 --> 01:52:31.380]  But I was told.
[01:52:32.381 --> 01:52:32.621]  It, uh...
[01:52:58.468 --> 01:53:04.654]  I'm about to say bump stocks are worthless pieces of crud.
[01:53:06.696 --> 01:53:07.797]  Yeah, you know, I just lost audio.
[01:53:07.817 --> 01:53:09.078]  Are you guys getting this audio?
[01:53:09.118 --> 01:53:12.701]  Yeah, it's almost like a haunted house in here, the way this audio works.
[01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:14.042]  Yeah, yeah, caller, go ahead.
[01:53:23.777 --> 01:53:28.979]  I just said that I was an infantryman in Vietnam and I never used full-auto once in all the firefights I was in.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.421]  But I have a bump stock and I just like to play with it on the range once in a while.
[01:53:34.502 --> 01:53:37.904]  But all semi-autos can be bump fired.
[01:53:38.304 --> 01:53:40.105]  This is going to affect all semi-autos.
[01:53:40.205 --> 01:53:49.009]  If the ATF should rule, it could affect all semi-automatics because all semi-automatics can fire like machine guns if you bump fire them or put a rubber band around the trigger.
[01:53:52.045 --> 01:54:06.848]  I'm getting every other word you're saying, brother, but I hear what you're saying, and I get even though bump stocks are kind of just a toy and never been used in a crime till Vegas, there was a stand down, it was an Islamic civil war deal spill over from Saudi Arabia, you know, I get all that now, and I think the
[01:54:07.108 --> 01:54:07.789]  The public gets it.
[01:54:07.829 --> 01:54:10.891]  I just don't like Trump even going along with the rhetoric, but I get it.
[01:54:11.231 --> 01:54:21.418]  He was smoking them out of their holes to get them to come out and say what they really wanted, and it's been a spectacular blow up in their face, and it's just woken up the sleeping conservatives and patriots, John.
[01:54:22.039 --> 01:54:23.219]  A great point.
[01:54:23.259 --> 01:54:23.740]  God bless you.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:24.520]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:27.362 --> 01:54:32.166]  Now, let's go ahead and take some more calls here.
[01:54:33.487 --> 01:54:35.948]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Indiana.
[01:54:36.028 --> 01:54:36.689]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:54:40.615 --> 01:54:44.497]  Yeah, I just got fed a couple calls.
[01:54:44.617 --> 01:54:45.177]  Same time.
[01:54:45.758 --> 01:54:47.879]  Got audio about one-tenth of one percent.
[01:54:47.899 --> 01:54:48.739]  I can barely hear you.
[01:54:48.759 --> 01:54:49.339]  I'm gonna try again.
[01:54:49.379 --> 01:54:49.900]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:51.841]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:52.201 --> 01:54:52.921]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:54:54.942 --> 01:54:58.024]  I just wanted to tell you I just ordered me a couple bottles of Brain Force.
[01:54:59.004 --> 01:55:00.004]  New shirt from y'all.
[01:55:00.024 --> 01:55:00.885]  Some Secret 12.
[01:55:01.005 --> 01:55:01.645]  It is great.
[01:55:01.705 --> 01:55:03.046]  I want to give you a little plug in first.
[01:55:03.965 --> 01:55:04.605]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:55:04.645 --> 01:55:12.207]  Without you, they hate the fact that we have community, that we have a culture, that we're building an infrastructure, promoting our ideals of freedom.
[01:55:12.247 --> 01:55:17.448]  They cannot... That's why they want to kill free market to begin with, because it's an engine that does things they don't control.
[01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:22.870]  They hate the great products you guys have, because they're trying to poison us every way they can.
[01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:27.611]  With the chemtrails, oh my God, above where I'm in southern Indiana, it is horrible.
[01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:32.192]  And I take pictures and, you know... Anyway, Second Amendment.
[01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:45.977]  All I gotta say is, they keep trying to repeal this, and there's gonna be more people coming out of the woodworks that are gun owners to protect their family and farms, and everybody's gonna vote, and they ain't gonna come close to us.
[01:55:47.097 --> 01:55:51.099]  And they can keep coming to get it, I'm gonna go buy me some new rifles, just because.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:56:01.645]  Well, look, the bottom line is the ethos of America is that everyone couldn't own weapons unless they were authorized, quote, nobility.
[01:56:02.745 --> 01:56:04.386]  And then in America, we could.
[01:56:04.846 --> 01:56:05.767]  Switzerland, you could.
[01:56:05.887 --> 01:56:07.328]  William Tell is their ethos.
[01:56:07.588 --> 01:56:08.068]  True story.
[01:56:08.269 --> 01:56:10.390]  Look at what happened there with the apple and the crossbow and all of it.
[01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:11.350]  That really happened.
[01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:15.833]  And, you know, they kicked the foreigners out, the globalists out, basically as it was the Germans.
[01:56:16.394 --> 01:56:18.775]  But that's what we've been through as an ethos.
[01:56:18.815 --> 01:56:21.337]  We know when they take your weapons, you're enslaved.
[01:56:22.745 --> 01:56:25.226]  And so that's how the country founded.
[01:56:25.306 --> 01:56:27.907]  Texas happened when Santa Ana come to take the guns.
[01:56:28.327 --> 01:56:29.707]  And so we're back there again.
[01:56:30.428 --> 01:56:33.969]  And they try to push this whole narrative that there can't be one more death by a gun.
[01:56:34.169 --> 01:56:35.249]  There's always going to be criminals.
[01:56:35.269 --> 01:56:41.071]  The idea that we're to blame because somebody else commits a crime is the essence of authoritarianism, Eric.
[01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:43.292]  What do you think of the job Trump's doing overall?
[01:56:44.304 --> 01:56:45.906]  Oh, I mean, I like it.
[01:56:46.046 --> 01:56:51.193]  I like how he's, like you said, I don't like how he goes along with them, but I love how he plays them.
[01:56:51.674 --> 01:56:53.115]  They're so, they're so stupid.
[01:56:53.876 --> 01:56:55.759]  It's like you and I said, these people are stupid.
[01:56:57.350 --> 01:57:00.831]  Absolutely, but you know, it's not a play with this omnibus bill.
[01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:04.471]  That was bad, but that's Congress, and they don't want to stall the economy.
[01:57:04.511 --> 01:57:06.472]  But bottom line, imagine where we'd be with Hillary right now.
[01:57:06.612 --> 01:57:07.832]  We should keep Trump's feet in the fire.
[01:57:08.272 --> 01:57:09.532]  We should be running people for Congress.
[01:57:09.552 --> 01:57:10.513]  We should be educating people.
[01:57:10.553 --> 01:57:11.953]  The war has just begun.
[01:57:11.993 --> 01:57:21.215]  If people really want the Republic back and not to have the Department of Education and the UN and Hollywood running our lives, who they admit in their own videos, their own documents, they hate our guts.
[01:57:21.275 --> 01:57:22.495]  These are globalist elitists.
[01:57:22.955 --> 01:57:27.276]  That have, again, imprinted on hating America, and it's all about who wants it the most.
[01:57:27.316 --> 01:57:30.757]  And they know we're awakening, so they're trying to bully back in right now.
[01:57:30.797 --> 01:57:31.997]  This is their counter-offensive.
[01:57:32.877 --> 01:57:34.258]  So, we're going to see what happens.
[01:57:34.298 --> 01:57:38.639]  Now, I'm going to work during the break on my audio, because I basically don't have it.
[01:57:38.659 --> 01:57:39.459]  So I need to get that fixed.
[01:57:39.679 --> 01:57:40.719]  I just want to make that clear.
[01:57:40.739 --> 01:57:44.840]  I had problems yesterday, and I love everybody, but I need to get this audio fixed.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:46.221]  We'll come back in the next hour.
[01:57:46.241 --> 01:57:47.141]  I've got a bunch of big guests.
[01:57:47.481 --> 01:57:49.882]  InfoWars.com, the audio feeds, video feeds.
[01:57:50.202 --> 01:57:51.242]  Please share them with everybody.
[01:57:54.884 --> 01:57:59.591]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[01:58:00.051 --> 01:58:01.594]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[01:58:01.634 --> 01:58:04.938]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:10.767]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[01:58:12.077 --> 01:58:15.879]  Okay, we want to first take him off the air, and then we're going to take everybody off.
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:16.880]  This is all admitted.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.921]  I told you that a month ago.
[01:58:18.021 --> 01:58:19.262]  It's all happening, as you see.
[01:58:19.602 --> 01:58:22.364]  So, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, go there.
[01:58:22.384 --> 01:58:23.404]  Get the t-shirt of the month.
[01:58:23.484 --> 01:58:27.087]  Trump, Pence, 2020, with the new slogan, Keeping America Great.
[01:58:27.107 --> 01:58:28.187]  I haven't even done an ad for that.
[01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:28.748]  I'm so busy.
[01:58:28.788 --> 01:58:30.689]  That's a one-month limited edition shirt.
[01:58:30.829 --> 01:58:32.370]  It's gone in just a few weeks.
[01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:34.011]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:34.131 --> 01:58:36.833]  In these lawsuits, Alex, I know the costs.
[01:58:37.373 --> 01:58:41.356]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight the Pony lawsuits.
[01:58:41.796 --> 01:58:51.062]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight the lawsuits against you and against InfoWars because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[01:58:51.623 --> 01:59:00.889]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button.
[01:59:01.329 --> 01:59:18.053]  If you just want to help fight for freedom, if you like what we're doing here, and you're not, just don't happen to be in the market for products that you've already got them or you're on auto ship, you can just go to the donate button and send us $25, $100, $150, $200.
[01:59:18.973 --> 01:59:27.215]  We're looking at massive, massive legal costs to fight the globalists and fight the efforts to just shut us down.
[01:59:27.255 --> 01:59:28.295]  So if you love InfoWars,
[01:59:28.795 --> 01:59:30.956]  Hit that donate button.
[01:59:30.996 --> 01:59:31.417]  Exactly.
[01:59:31.457 --> 01:59:34.879]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPB and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[01:59:34.899 --> 01:59:36.059]  We have the listeners doing it.
[01:59:36.179 --> 01:59:44.224]  And we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you, saying you're a Russian agent, and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[01:59:44.244 --> 01:59:44.945]  We're winning.
[01:59:45.005 --> 01:59:46.265]  It's why they're targeting us.
[01:59:46.486 --> 01:59:49.567]  But people need to know this is the war for this republic.
[01:59:49.607 --> 01:59:50.228]  This is it.
[01:59:54.952 --> 01:59:59.062]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.584 --> 02:00:00.887]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:16.858 --> 02:00:22.562]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.802 --> 02:00:25.904]  Alright, I got my little audio piece fixed here.
[02:00:25.924 --> 02:00:28.366]  I was like really straining to hear the callers, but I could hear them.
[02:00:28.806 --> 02:00:29.527]  Got that fixed.
[02:00:30.027 --> 02:00:30.467]  Thank God.
[02:00:30.487 --> 02:00:36.431]  These little flimsy wires, they just break after a few months, and then it's like suddenly the earpieces all go bad.
[02:00:36.872 --> 02:00:39.353]  Just pieces of junk, but side issue.
[02:00:42.596 --> 02:00:43.416]  We were just talking to Eric.
[02:00:43.436 --> 02:00:44.377]  Eric, I appreciate your call.
[02:00:44.397 --> 02:00:45.798]  We're going to go to some other callers here now.
[02:00:47.284 --> 02:00:48.845]  I just talked to Ted Nugent during the break.
[02:00:49.946 --> 02:00:56.670]  He's going to come on tomorrow, and then we're going to air the hour-plus interview I did with him that's very powerful.
[02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:58.131]  I thought he was really on fire.
[02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:02.554]  Show the antidote to the globalist assault on our Second Amendment.
[02:01:03.542 --> 02:01:07.886]  Uncle Ted DeMauro, but still a lot of the show will still be live.
[02:01:07.906 --> 02:01:13.770]  He'll be on live, then we'll air the taped interview that Harrison and Dew and all them put together, doing a great job.
[02:01:14.211 --> 02:01:16.132]  And then we're going to continue with phone calls and things.
[02:01:16.172 --> 02:01:20.295]  Right now, I want to go to Adam in New York, then Jeff, Sam, Jarrett, Cameron, and others.
[02:01:20.716 --> 02:01:22.397]  Adam, thank you for holding and putting up with me.
[02:01:22.417 --> 02:01:22.938]  You're on the air.
[02:01:22.978 --> 02:01:23.278]  Go ahead.
[02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:25.958]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:01:27.319 --> 02:01:28.520]  So, three things really quick.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.661]  I have this theory about Trump.
[02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:31.602]  I want to run past you and see what you think about it.
[02:01:31.622 --> 02:01:36.045]  I want to tell you about upcoming gun rallies coming up this month.
[02:01:36.225 --> 02:01:37.966]  And then I also wanted to plug for you if you allow.
[02:01:38.647 --> 02:01:39.647]  Sure, go ahead brother, thanks.
[02:01:40.928 --> 02:01:42.870]  Alright, so this theory I've had about Trump for a while.
[02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:46.652]  We know that Trump is a brilliant strategist with all the 4D chess and everything.
[02:01:47.653 --> 02:01:53.477]  But with this latest masterstroke that he just pulled, I think my theory is true.
[02:01:54.736 --> 02:01:57.478]  I think that Bruce Wayne is not Batman.
[02:01:58.339 --> 02:01:59.480]  Donald Trump is Batman.
[02:02:00.161 --> 02:02:02.983]  I'm not talking goofy, campy, Adam West Batman.
[02:02:03.003 --> 02:02:10.510]  I'm talking Frank Miller, GD, Batman, who always got a contingency plan and kicks Superman's butt on the regular.
[02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:15.414]  Well, I mean, yeah, he is from Gotham, too.
[02:02:15.874 --> 02:02:19.397]  Also, I wanted to just, really quick, I see upcoming
[02:02:20.826 --> 02:02:25.830]  This group I don't know about, they're called the National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans.
[02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:31.473]  They're trying to get gun rallies going in every state capitol.
[02:02:31.493 --> 02:02:33.435]  Yeah, well I don't know who they are, but I support it.
[02:02:33.675 --> 02:02:35.236]  We need to just get out there.
[02:02:36.517 --> 02:02:42.501]  Yeah, it looks like it's going to be April 14th at every state capitol, so I'm planning on going to one here in New York.
[02:02:45.462 --> 02:02:46.503]  No, I agree.
[02:02:46.563 --> 02:02:47.844]  And on Patriots Day, too.
[02:02:47.884 --> 02:02:49.085]  I don't care if it's one person.
[02:02:49.605 --> 02:02:50.846]  It'll be more than that.
[02:02:50.886 --> 02:02:52.107]  People then see that and more come out.
[02:02:52.567 --> 02:02:54.689]  Everybody should go to their state capitals.
[02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:57.251]  And it doesn't matter if mainstream media doesn't cover you.
[02:02:57.711 --> 02:02:58.552]  Stream it on YouTube.
[02:02:58.572 --> 02:02:59.452]  Stream it on Facebook.
[02:02:59.793 --> 02:03:00.914]  Put it on local TV.
[02:03:01.814 --> 02:03:02.154]  Whatever.
[02:03:02.214 --> 02:03:03.235]  Just get involved.
[02:03:03.615 --> 02:03:05.017]  We've got to get moving here.
[02:03:05.737 --> 02:03:12.680]  But listen, was it a masterstroke by Trump trying to sound political and invading the left to come out with what they really wanted?
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.641]  Or was it them being a bunch of arrogant idiots?
[02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:17.802]  Because, you know, they always go, oh, just be reasonable.
[02:03:17.882 --> 02:03:18.943]  Just don't let kids die.
[02:03:19.203 --> 02:03:24.045]  And then it's always the police stand down in a liberal city and some Prozac head kills people.
[02:03:24.465 --> 02:03:25.626]  And it's still incredibly rare.
[02:03:26.006 --> 02:03:27.947]  I'm not saying it's not horrible, but it's like...
[02:03:29.524 --> 02:03:30.704]  The federal numbers vary.
[02:03:31.005 --> 02:03:31.705]  It's never more than 50.
[02:03:31.825 --> 02:03:33.005]  It's like 37, 48.
[02:03:34.185 --> 02:03:36.826]  It's less than 50 kids a year get shot in mass shootings.
[02:03:36.886 --> 02:03:37.826]  And that's too many!
[02:03:38.527 --> 02:03:43.228]  But it's still incredibly rare and most of it's gangbangers killing each other.
[02:03:43.688 --> 02:03:44.208]  What do you think?
[02:03:45.509 --> 02:03:45.849]  I agree.
[02:03:45.889 --> 02:03:47.009]  I think it's a little bit of both.
[02:03:47.429 --> 02:03:48.069]  And it's interesting.
[02:03:48.089 --> 02:03:57.732]  Yesterday I was watching a show and about 20 minutes, half hour before Paul was on talking about how they're trying to walk stuff back, I started noticing on social media these articles
[02:03:58.559 --> 02:04:12.887]  Um, saying, oh, maybe it's not a good idea we repeal the 2nd Amendment, and then people in the comment section saying, oh, you know, we can't be this radical, this is too far, calling for the repeal and saying... Exactly, they're like, hey guys, don't tell them we're gonna hang them up by their toes and slit their throats.
[02:04:12.947 --> 02:04:13.327]  Exactly.
[02:04:13.627 --> 02:04:14.168]  Let me tell you something.
[02:04:14.648 --> 02:04:18.590]  They got a bunch of camp followers and cowards and idiots and mental patients as their minions.
[02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:24.954]  But when you get mid-level Democrat, they are craven, cowardly, evil parasites.
[02:04:26.047 --> 02:04:28.248]  And I've had them threaten me and go, of course we're evil.
[02:04:28.789 --> 02:04:29.889]  Of course we're running scams.
[02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:30.850]  Of course we own guns.
[02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:37.134]  It's like Al Sharpton's brother just got arrested one day after his anti-gun march, shooting a woman in the head twice.
[02:04:37.734 --> 02:04:39.355]  In a drive-by, reportedly.
[02:04:41.097 --> 02:04:48.521]  I mean, you know, it's like... Of course some gang-banging thug wants your guns.
[02:04:51.303 --> 02:04:52.344]  Great points, God bless you.
[02:04:53.356 --> 02:04:58.319]  They'll be back with more phone calls and then we've got a victim of Islamic terror joining us.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:01.021]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.503 --> 02:05:05.824]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:05:05.844 --> 02:05:07.586]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:08.006 --> 02:05:10.828]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[02:05:46.495 --> 02:05:48.516]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:05:49.787 --> 02:05:52.611]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:54.213]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:05:54.834 --> 02:05:57.398]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:05:58.159 --> 02:06:00.102]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[02:06:21.101 --> 02:06:27.505]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:27.645 --> 02:06:29.126]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.028 --> 02:06:35.270]  Shazia Hobbs joins us for the next 30 minutes, then we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:06:36.051 --> 02:06:45.197]  We've got another special guest joining us from the UK as well, who's been banned from Twitter today, Mr. Robbins.
[02:06:47.301 --> 02:06:47.501]  Ms.
[02:06:47.541 --> 02:06:55.225]  Hobbs is the daughter of a Pakistani Muslim father and Scottish Catholic mother, born in Glasgow, Scotland, and raised in a polygamous home.
[02:06:56.225 --> 02:06:58.026]  She was forced into marriage when she was 18 years old.
[02:06:58.987 --> 02:07:04.650]  She left after almost three years of hell, the only time in her life when she thought of suicide.
[02:07:05.210 --> 02:07:10.052]  She has disavowed by her father and the entire Pakistani community for leaving the marriage.
[02:07:10.672 --> 02:07:13.134]  She has volunteered and worked for BME charities.
[02:07:13.934 --> 02:07:19.076]  And raising awareness and helping women who suffer like she did is something she is very passionate about.
[02:07:19.616 --> 02:07:27.699]  She now writes at Alt News Media about her biggest passion to raise awareness about the abuse of Muslim children by Muslim men.
[02:07:28.859 --> 02:07:34.081]  And again, she is at Alt News Media, altnewsmedia.net.
[02:07:34.661 --> 02:07:35.141]  And so, Ms.
[02:07:35.181 --> 02:07:36.502]  Hobbs, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:07:36.522 --> 02:07:39.983]  I think you should start with your own story, and then the big story I've got here
[02:07:41.226 --> 02:07:42.226]  We should probably pull the clip up.
[02:07:42.246 --> 02:07:43.007]  I forgot to tell the crew.
[02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:43.627]  That's my fault.
[02:07:43.647 --> 02:07:45.048]  Most of the time it looks like I'm mad at the crew.
[02:07:45.088 --> 02:07:48.629]  I'm frustrated with myself because I'm supposed to plan this out as the main producer.
[02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:56.433]  Khan was here a week and a half ago, the Islamic mayor, who's banning women in swimsuit ads in London on buses.
[02:07:56.453 --> 02:07:57.333]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:07:58.494 --> 02:08:00.074]  Protecting all these Islamists coming in.
[02:08:01.455 --> 02:08:05.857]  And he used one of her tweets about
[02:08:07.288 --> 02:08:16.238]  Do something about genital mutilation knowing Trendy's in Austin wouldn't even know about that and going look I'm being threatened with my genitals being cut off and then she got banned off Twitter.
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:19.642]  So Tommy Robinson just got banned today.
[02:08:19.882 --> 02:08:24.247]  This is a giant purge and you keep doing it until they think we're just gonna give up.
[02:08:25.988 --> 02:08:29.112]  London Mayor Sadiq Khan calls for Silicon Valley to end free speech.
[02:08:34.246 --> 02:08:36.768]  So Shazia, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:37.569 --> 02:08:39.490]  I've followed you, I'm already aware of you.
[02:08:40.671 --> 02:08:43.193]  You're very polite, you're very nice, you're very well-spoken.
[02:08:44.054 --> 02:08:48.798]  You just are politely asking the mayor to lead a campaign on female genital mutilation.
[02:08:50.239 --> 02:08:54.683]  And then the left bans you and hates you, and Linda Sorcerer says it doesn't matter.
[02:08:55.063 --> 02:09:01.308]  She said the women not wearing hijabs and wanting to be able to be free in Iran are evil and should shut up.
[02:09:02.529 --> 02:09:02.770]  I mean...
[02:09:04.178 --> 02:09:05.205]  How did the left...
[02:09:06.298 --> 02:09:09.259]  Embrace the most orthodox, oppressive forms of Islam.
[02:09:09.499 --> 02:09:28.143]  We'll get to that, but first, you've got the floor, your story, your awakening, what it's like inside Islam, so that other women who hear it's the ultimate feminist thing to get on a plane to Saudi Arabia and get chained up against a wall for ten years, I mean, they're being told this is the sacrament of the left, this is Gloria Steinem's ambrosia.
[02:09:28.523 --> 02:09:30.103]  How did this warp thing happen?
[02:09:30.123 --> 02:09:31.663]  Is this Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:09:31.703 --> 02:09:34.644]  Is it a form of the left wanting to cuck women?
[02:09:34.664 --> 02:09:35.164]  What's happening?
[02:09:36.164 --> 02:09:37.885]  I'm not really too sure what's happening.
[02:09:38.646 --> 02:09:45.210]  These women live in the West and a lot of them will be free, you know, they have the freedoms in the West.
[02:09:47.071 --> 02:09:51.094]  But there are just as many women that live in the West that don't have freedom.
[02:09:51.454 --> 02:09:54.216]  I was forced into a marriage when I was 18.
[02:09:55.797 --> 02:10:00.840]  It's the only time in my life where I have really seriously contemplated suicide.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:04.502]  It's just, you know, it's awful.
[02:10:07.027 --> 02:10:35.525]  To be forced to marry a man that you don't love, you don't have anything in common with, and then to have the Mayor of London, that he has a platform, he claims to be a feminist, he could be the voice for so many women that he knows that are forced into marriage in his community, taken out of school, not allowed to complete their education, forced to marry, you know, a life of misery, a life of making
[02:10:36.717 --> 02:10:44.844]  I mean, this is the true slavery that women claim, ultra-leftists, that any patriarchy is.
[02:10:44.864 --> 02:10:46.605]  This is, is this not slavery?
[02:10:46.625 --> 02:10:52.029]  I mean, making you, I mean, some women as young as 12, 13, 10, the brother Mohammed, a nine-year-old.
[02:10:52.410 --> 02:10:57.694]  I mean, this is, Pakistan, Turkey's trying to legalize sex with nine-year-old girls.
[02:10:57.774 --> 02:11:00.536]  I mean, it's beyond even enslavement.
[02:11:00.616 --> 02:11:01.357]  It's pedophilia.
[02:11:02.901 --> 02:11:09.925]  And for some strange reason, we don't have feminists marching in their thousands.
[02:11:09.985 --> 02:11:13.687]  We'll have them march in the UK because they don't want Trump to come and visit.
[02:11:14.587 --> 02:11:16.268]  They'll take to the streets for that.
[02:11:16.348 --> 02:11:23.952]  But for women that are forced into marriage, we have a law in the UK now that it's illegal to force your child into marriage.
[02:11:23.972 --> 02:11:25.513]  So where are they protesting for this?
[02:11:30.467 --> 02:11:44.544]  I mean, you deal with just the abuse of children, period, under Islam and the beating of people severely, public torture, you name it, but specifically on the sexual mutilization or women being mutilated when they're babies.
[02:11:45.585 --> 02:11:51.590]  The left makes jokes about this, they make jokes about women being sold on slave blocks after Hillary liberated Libya.
[02:11:52.090 --> 02:12:04.419]  What can you testify to folks goes on inside Islam with young girls, babies and Khan spinning it as if you saying please stop mutilation was summed up a threat on him?
[02:12:04.439 --> 02:12:09.743]  No, you know he read out a few different tweets as well.
[02:12:09.823 --> 02:12:13.006]  He read out one where he said that somebody called him a sparrow.
[02:12:14.301 --> 02:12:16.206]  I don't see anything hateful about that at all.
[02:12:16.327 --> 02:12:20.538]  He read out another one that somebody had called him a pigeon and then he read out...
[02:12:21.198 --> 02:12:28.663]  The tweet that I asked, you know, I asked him, will the full force of the law be brought down on parents who mutilate their daughter's vaginas?
[02:12:28.943 --> 02:12:32.846]  And he read that out as a hate speech, which is just absolute nonsense.
[02:12:33.406 --> 02:12:36.929]  So saying, don't mutilate little girls is the act of hate.
[02:12:37.209 --> 02:12:42.332]  No, you're trying to lovingly stop it, but they transmute it like alchemy that that just sounds hateful.
[02:12:42.772 --> 02:12:45.654]  About stop, stand up for little girls' vaginas.
[02:12:46.755 --> 02:12:49.417]  He knows Western audiences may not know, so it just sounds hateful.
[02:12:49.737 --> 02:12:50.798]  No, he knows full well.
[02:12:53.471 --> 02:12:57.058]  We don't have an exact number of how many girls are
[02:12:58.402 --> 02:12:59.683]  have been cut in the UK.
[02:13:00.064 --> 02:13:03.887]  They estimate the figure at £137,000.
[02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:09.392]  We have FGM clinics open to deal with the aftermath.
[02:13:09.472 --> 02:13:11.674]  We have a zero-tolerance day for FGM.
[02:13:11.734 --> 02:13:18.500]  We have BME charities that are giving funding, but we have not one single parent that has been punished.
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:19.901]  It's child abuse.
[02:13:19.981 --> 02:13:21.842]  If I beat my daughter,
[02:13:22.603 --> 02:13:25.744]  Well, I can see there's one argument for circumcision and another against.
[02:13:25.824 --> 02:13:31.005]  I think people should be able to choose it because there's evidence that it is arcane and bad.
[02:13:31.566 --> 02:13:34.366]  But with women, they're not even saying it's for a health issue.
[02:13:34.386 --> 02:13:39.328]  They say so a woman can't have pleasure later in life cutting their clitoris off.
[02:13:39.368 --> 02:13:40.708]  That's for documentary purposes, folks.
[02:13:40.728 --> 02:13:44.189]  This is an adult show, children's show, but people need to be educated.
[02:13:44.569 --> 02:13:45.589]  It's an informational show.
[02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:48.630]  I mean, that is serious, serious, serious abuse.
[02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:50.831]  There is not even an argument for medical reasons.
[02:13:51.926 --> 02:13:52.506]  There's none.
[02:13:52.646 --> 02:13:54.546]  There's absolutely no reason.
[02:13:55.207 --> 02:13:57.947]  There's no reason for male circumcision either.
[02:14:00.067 --> 02:14:05.408]  We're cutting healthy babies for no reason but to please men.
[02:14:05.428 --> 02:14:12.770]  It's a priest class wanting to be over and controlling procreation.
[02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:13.450]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:18.831]  I'm just saying, with that they claim there's a medical issue.
[02:14:21.354 --> 02:14:23.676]  But under Islam, they just say women shouldn't have pleasure.
[02:14:24.137 --> 02:14:26.759]  So they're not even saying it's medical, is my point.
[02:14:28.621 --> 02:14:29.261]  Yep.
[02:14:29.281 --> 02:14:31.223]  They don't want women to be promiscuous, you know.
[02:14:31.323 --> 02:14:34.986]  So we made it illegal in 1985 in the UK.
[02:14:35.046 --> 02:14:38.949]  We never ever should have had a special law for FGM.
[02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:41.852]  It's child abuse.
[02:14:42.572 --> 02:14:45.014]  And it's just completely wrong.
[02:14:45.335 --> 02:14:46.596]  Why do you think Khan
[02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:53.686]  Misrepresented you and demonized you and sided with the millions of little girls having their genitals cut off.
[02:14:54.866 --> 02:14:56.707]  I have no idea, honestly.
[02:14:56.787 --> 02:14:58.147]  I really don't know why.
[02:14:58.167 --> 02:15:01.488]  I can't understand how he could stand there.
[02:15:01.568 --> 02:15:07.570]  Like, how can he stand there and read that out and think that people are going to believe it's hate speech?
[02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:11.451]  Like, it's just, it's just, it's really bad for you.
[02:15:11.471 --> 02:15:12.612]  But that's what the left does.
[02:15:12.632 --> 02:15:14.112]  They just misrepresent what we say.
[02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:14.792]  That's what they do.
[02:15:15.713 --> 02:15:16.793]  Yeah, that's very true.
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:20.483]  Well, I want to go to break, because I've been asked the questions.
[02:15:20.503 --> 02:15:23.407]  You're a great lady, you have a lot of courage, and you've been leading the international movement to do this.
[02:15:23.447 --> 02:15:25.429]  You've been banned, I know, and blocked on Twitter.
[02:15:25.449 --> 02:15:34.242]  I want to talk about that, and I know they brought you back up after you got attention to this, but people can follow you there on Twitter.
[02:15:34.702 --> 02:15:35.183]  On Twitter.
[02:15:35.503 --> 02:15:37.285]  And we'll tell folks about that on the other side.
[02:15:37.345 --> 02:15:40.228]  But we need to really get in the face of fake feminists.
[02:15:40.528 --> 02:15:42.510]  Because they're not just giving Islam a pass.
[02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:48.315]  They are actively acting like it is the best thing on Earth, but the West is bad.
[02:15:48.836 --> 02:15:51.138]  And that really boils my blood.
[02:15:51.739 --> 02:15:52.459]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:53.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:54.521]  Newswars.com.
[02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:55.342]  Please spread that link.
[02:15:55.823 --> 02:15:56.523]  They hope you don't.
[02:15:56.644 --> 02:15:58.886]  The globalists are trying to censor us just like they're censoring her.
[02:16:02.426 --> 02:16:16.693]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[02:16:19.195 --> 02:16:25.278]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[02:16:26.710 --> 02:16:29.232]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[02:16:30.033 --> 02:16:33.455]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[02:16:34.396 --> 02:16:36.578]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[02:16:38.279 --> 02:16:43.463]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[02:16:45.405 --> 02:16:52.010]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:53.952]  It's up to us personally.
[02:16:55.365 --> 02:17:02.189]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:17:02.710 --> 02:17:04.010]  I expected that to happen.
[02:17:05.171 --> 02:17:06.512]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:17:08.516 --> 02:17:19.444]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[02:17:20.145 --> 02:17:21.686]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[02:17:22.387 --> 02:17:34.016]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[02:17:34.596 --> 02:17:36.778]  And we've already come so far together
[02:17:37.813 --> 02:17:46.816]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[02:17:47.396 --> 02:17:52.798]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[02:17:53.939 --> 02:18:01.801]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[02:18:04.045 --> 02:18:08.789]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[02:18:10.310 --> 02:18:12.312]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[02:18:12.692 --> 02:18:14.293]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[02:18:15.294 --> 02:18:17.956]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[02:18:18.737 --> 02:18:20.578]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[02:18:20.598 --> 02:18:25.502]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[02:18:26.583 --> 02:18:37.375]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[02:18:37.415 --> 02:18:41.380]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[02:18:42.794 --> 02:18:43.455]  Our game changing.
[02:18:43.875 --> 02:18:45.376]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[02:18:45.616 --> 02:18:48.158]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[02:18:48.538 --> 02:18:49.699]  The other equation of probiotic.
[02:18:49.759 --> 02:18:53.321]  It's now stronger and a lower price at importwarshtore.com.
[02:18:53.621 --> 02:18:59.145]  We've got the real red pill that's got preglanone that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[02:18:59.705 --> 02:19:02.966]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[02:19:02.986 --> 02:19:04.067]  It just does incredible things.
[02:19:04.487 --> 02:19:05.948]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[02:19:05.968 --> 02:19:08.949]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[02:19:08.969 --> 02:19:11.570]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:16.852]  That's 4-5 acryloyl silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[02:19:17.493 --> 02:19:20.154]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[02:19:20.894 --> 02:19:28.618]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of coital silver out there.
[02:19:29.058 --> 02:19:35.961]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[02:19:36.001 --> 02:19:37.282]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[02:19:37.482 --> 02:19:38.683]  You can swallow it as well.
[02:19:39.063 --> 02:19:45.046]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:45.666 --> 02:19:47.047]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:19:47.067 --> 02:19:56.670]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWorksStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:19:56.990 --> 02:20:00.051]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:20:06.153 --> 02:20:08.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.650 --> 02:20:26.916]  So, here's Sadiq Khan calling for an end of the First Amendment, dubbing it hate speech at South by Southwest.
[02:20:27.256 --> 02:20:29.157]  The head of YouTube came and gave the same speech.
[02:20:29.938 --> 02:20:32.240]  And I got a big stack of articles calling for me to be banned today.
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:35.303]  I mean, this is the real tyranny we're witnessing here in the U.S.
[02:20:35.343 --> 02:20:36.043]  and worldwide.
[02:20:36.103 --> 02:20:37.324]  But humanity is awakening.
[02:20:37.925 --> 02:20:38.345]  And here is...
[02:20:39.813 --> 02:20:55.241]  Sadiq Khan reading Shazia Hobbs' tweet out of context like he's being harassed when she's calling for him to speak out and be a spokesperson as the Islamic mayor of London against sexual mutilation of little girls.
[02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:56.742]  So here it is.
[02:20:58.943 --> 02:21:05.066]  If you use a knife to mutilate your daughter's vagina, will the full force of the law be brought down on you?
[02:21:05.746 --> 02:21:09.108]  Asking for a Muslim, let's work together to end this hate.
[02:21:10.982 --> 02:21:22.147]  So, if you point out that almost all the girls in Pakistan, you name it, now it's happening to tens of thousands in England, sexual grooming, they spin it, they don't address what they're doing.
[02:21:23.588 --> 02:21:28.070]  Like David Hogg, we're going to ban your guns, you know, we're going to have the Second Amendment, you're shaking in fear.
[02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:30.491]  Okay, well I think that's pretty Hitlerian.
[02:21:31.112 --> 02:21:34.853]  Oh my God, you just talked bad about a child, I want to ban you, you're hateful!
[02:21:35.534 --> 02:21:39.976]  It's like, man, they're drama queens while they're trying to get our rights.
[02:21:42.014 --> 02:21:47.055]  Shazia Hobbs, what was it like going under Islam?
[02:21:47.215 --> 02:21:48.075]  What have you witnessed?
[02:21:48.095 --> 02:21:50.036]  The grooming, all the things.
[02:21:50.236 --> 02:21:51.816]  Why is the left allied with Islam?
[02:21:52.616 --> 02:21:53.996]  You're leading this worldwide movement.
[02:21:54.016 --> 02:21:55.477]  You're being blocked and banned.
[02:21:55.497 --> 02:21:56.717]  You were banned on Twitter for a while.
[02:21:56.737 --> 02:21:57.097]  You're back.
[02:21:57.417 --> 02:21:58.957]  Tell folks how people can follow you on Twitter.
[02:21:59.457 --> 02:22:00.618]  Let's talk about the censorship.
[02:22:02.438 --> 02:22:06.779]  I think my first ban was last summer.
[02:22:08.516 --> 02:22:18.242]  And most of the things that I tweet about, you know, we obviously have a problem with rape gangs in the UK, but the forgotten victims are Muslim children.
[02:22:18.322 --> 02:22:22.264]  Nobody really speaks about the Muslim children that are raped by Muslim men.
[02:22:22.324 --> 02:22:29.729]  So I would tweet about that quite a lot and I would get obviously mass reported and they suspended my account.
[02:22:31.231 --> 02:22:36.594]  I keep coming back because you can always come back through the suspension.
[02:22:37.274 --> 02:22:38.815]  And then I've got a seven-day ban.
[02:22:39.275 --> 02:22:57.163]  The week that Sadiq Khan was in America and he read out the tweet, I was on a seven-day ban for saying that Muslim girls are anally raped by Muslim men so they can still be virgins on their wedding night because virginity is such
[02:22:58.283 --> 02:22:59.223]  An honourable thing.
[02:22:59.624 --> 02:23:03.765]  You have to be a virgin on your wedding night.
[02:23:04.646 --> 02:23:25.414]  So yeah, it's just really strange that all these feminists and Sadiq Khan, like I had said earlier, has said that he's a feminist and he knows that this goes on in our community, but the Pakistani community is not, or the Muslim community is not, you know, Muslim children aren't born with a special shield that protects them from paedophiles and
[02:23:26.218 --> 02:23:33.841]  Whenever you talk about this, you always get people saying, white men rape, white men rape their kids, white men do this, white men do that.
[02:23:33.942 --> 02:23:36.803]  And, you know, the Catholic Church and Jimmy Savile.
[02:23:36.903 --> 02:23:42.325]  And we know, we talk about that, you know, and we're disgusted by it.
[02:23:42.345 --> 02:23:46.767]  So why can't we speak about the Muslim community?
[02:23:46.827 --> 02:23:52.530]  Why, whenever we want to speak about Muslim children and wanting to protect Muslim children,
[02:23:53.647 --> 02:24:02.451]  There's always this deflection that, you know, I look at what Christian, you know, if you're talking about Muslims, then talk about Christians, what they're doing to their children.
[02:24:03.872 --> 02:24:13.416]  But when we do talk about Christian paedophiles or the Catholic Church or football coaches or celebrities, you know, we had the hashtag MeToo.
[02:24:13.436 --> 02:24:16.517]  Nobody then said Muslim men rape too.
[02:24:17.298 --> 02:24:20.079]  You're allowed to discuss that and you're allowed to talk about it.
[02:24:20.279 --> 02:24:22.300]  Nobody then says Muslim men do it too.
[02:24:22.941 --> 02:24:27.924]  It just seems to be when we talk about Muslims, you're not allowed to... Well, that's it.
[02:24:28.164 --> 02:24:29.545]  We were just putting articles on screen.
[02:24:29.986 --> 02:24:36.590]  The New York Times put it in paragraph 12 that it was a gang of Muslim men that just stabbed an old woman to death by the Eiffel Tower.
[02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:38.131]  They will not say it.
[02:24:38.191 --> 02:24:41.933]  They fired police chiefs that admit that 90 plus percent of it is Islamic.
[02:24:42.934 --> 02:24:48.718]  It is true that some of the other gangs are now picking it up because no one ever put up with this treatment of women.
[02:24:48.778 --> 02:24:50.359]  I mean, you know, these type of crimes.
[02:24:52.153 --> 02:25:00.294]  Headmaster tells mother of daughter bullied by Muslims to cover up her face with a hijab so she doesn't get beat up or raped.
[02:25:01.515 --> 02:25:02.695]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:25:03.075 --> 02:25:07.636]  Islamic group asking US residents if they're American citizens is white supremacy.
[02:25:07.676 --> 02:25:08.176]  That's CARE.
[02:25:09.216 --> 02:25:14.737]  New York Times waits 12 paragraphs before noting suspect in Jewish woman's murder is of North African origin.
[02:25:16.337 --> 02:25:18.938]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.401]  And on, why do you think the left is so allied with the most radical forms of Islam?
[02:25:24.421 --> 02:25:29.103]  I have no idea, honestly.
[02:25:29.123 --> 02:25:34.084]  I think they're just, they're brainwashed, you know.
[02:25:34.104 --> 02:25:45.568]  We see it here in the UK, so my little girl is at primary school, she's 10 years old, and they're taught at school that Islam is a religion of peace.
[02:25:46.491 --> 02:25:53.475]  And it's just a really small minority that gives Islam a bad name.
[02:25:54.436 --> 02:25:56.577]  So, you know, my daughter's not, she's not silly.
[02:25:56.617 --> 02:26:03.181]  She knows mum's an ex-Muslim and it's punishable by death.
[02:26:04.762 --> 02:26:07.844]  So they're taught in primary school that it's peaceful.
[02:26:07.864 --> 02:26:09.345]  They don't question it unless
[02:26:10.066 --> 02:26:13.067]  They have people like me.
[02:26:13.207 --> 02:26:14.287]  People just don't question it.
[02:26:14.327 --> 02:26:23.868]  People are quite happy to live their life in a bubble, live for the weekends, whether it's to watch their reality TVs or to go out drinking, socializing.
[02:26:23.948 --> 02:26:24.549]  Well, that's it.
[02:26:24.589 --> 02:26:36.751]  The West has been so open and so free, and we're so free, we're always trying to be better, that we automatically think something outside must be good and pure, and then it comes in and it's like a virus we're not used to and it wipes us out.
[02:26:36.771 --> 02:26:38.391]  I mean, I think that's what this is.
[02:26:39.827 --> 02:26:56.756]  I think it's interesting being taught from primary school and then going to high school and being given the same message and then going to university and still being taught the same message and then you know they become adults and you see it you see it in social media you see
[02:26:57.987 --> 02:27:01.049]  White people that have no idea of what Islam is like.
[02:27:01.109 --> 02:27:03.410]  They've never experienced it.
[02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:05.071]  They might have some nice Muslim neighbors.
[02:27:05.252 --> 02:27:07.773]  You know, it's not to say all Muslim people are bad.
[02:27:07.953 --> 02:27:15.498]  No, that's true, but they're using white guilt to then have Westerners accept any form of criminality or bizarre behavior.
[02:27:16.078 --> 02:27:17.339]  Because we don't want to say anything.
[02:27:17.359 --> 02:27:26.646]  Just like they knew in some towns 4,000 girls recruited, dozens being killed, and the police would do nothing because it was brown men grabbing little girls.
[02:27:27.467 --> 02:27:28.668]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:35.152]  Yeah, I think it's been going on since they arrived in the 60s.
[02:27:35.452 --> 02:27:39.554]  They didn't wake up one day in 1986 and decide to rape white girls.
[02:27:39.614 --> 02:27:43.575]  It's been going on since their arrival and they just don't know how to deal with it.
[02:27:43.615 --> 02:27:45.856]  You know, Rochdale is one of the towns as well.
[02:27:45.896 --> 02:27:53.059]  I've just interviewed one of the dads from Rochdale for Alt News Media and it's still going on.
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:57.001]  Rochdale is known the world over for all the wrong reasons.
[02:27:58.939 --> 02:28:00.421]  And it hasn't, it's not stopped.
[02:28:00.982 --> 02:28:03.626]  The girls are still being groomed, the girls are still being raped.
[02:28:03.946 --> 02:28:12.299]  And if you were to reverse that, you know, and if it was Muslim girls and it was gangs of Christian men grooming and raping them.
[02:28:13.815 --> 02:28:15.235]  Britain would be on fire.
[02:28:15.295 --> 02:28:16.356]  They would be rioting.
[02:28:16.496 --> 02:28:19.657]  So it's not just that it's the brown man that's doing it.
[02:28:19.697 --> 02:28:20.877]  There's a fear.
[02:28:21.397 --> 02:28:29.879]  When Salman Rushdie wrote his book, and they rioted, and they burnt his book, and, you know, the army should have been brought in, and these men should have been arrested.
[02:28:29.899 --> 02:28:33.980]  Well, we've got to go on a break, but I want to do five more minutes with you talking about solutions and ideas, and I want to be clear.
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:39.962]  I don't want to just blame Muslims for this, because there's been periods in Islam where it wasn't like this in some areas where they've not done this.
[02:28:41.314 --> 02:29:00.120]  There is the pedophilia at the top of the British government that loves this and I think that's the alliance is that a lot of these police departments and other groups that's come out are like that the radical Muslims are there because it's giving them cover and we know that a lot of people in the UK are working with the Muslims and going and having sex with these girls as well.
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:01.380]  So that's what this is.
[02:29:02.597 --> 02:29:07.081]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[02:29:07.222 --> 02:29:14.629]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.

[02:29:19.113 --> 02:29:25.075]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[02:29:25.255 --> 02:29:31.618]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:29:31.838 --> 02:29:41.982]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:29:42.142 --> 02:29:48.647]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:29:49.007 --> 02:29:51.649]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[02:29:51.889 --> 02:29:55.212]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.

[02:30:00.496 --> 02:30:02.398]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:03.277 --> 02:30:03.998]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:04.078 --> 02:30:13.624]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:14.204 --> 02:30:19.388]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:19.728 --> 02:30:22.530]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:31.476]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:33.597 --> 02:30:38.401]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:30:38.921 --> 02:30:43.144]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:30:43.865 --> 02:30:52.712]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:53.212 --> 02:30:54.493]  It is amazing!
[02:30:55.894 --> 02:31:00.858]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:08.589]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified libtards on Twitter.
[02:31:08.689 --> 02:31:11.371]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[02:31:11.451 --> 02:31:17.434]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[02:31:17.454 --> 02:31:19.795]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[02:31:19.955 --> 02:31:28.118]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[02:31:28.219 --> 02:31:31.080]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:41.185]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[02:31:41.265 --> 02:31:44.507]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[02:31:44.607 --> 02:31:52.291]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:52.351 --> 02:31:53.372]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:31:53.452 --> 02:31:55.513]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[02:31:55.553 --> 02:31:56.573]  It was hilarious.
[02:31:58.675 --> 02:32:00.876]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[02:32:01.017 --> 02:32:10.825]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[02:32:10.865 --> 02:32:13.268]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[02:32:13.868 --> 02:32:20.294]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[02:32:20.894 --> 02:32:22.516]  Gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[02:32:23.699 --> 02:32:29.987]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[02:32:30.047 --> 02:32:32.170]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:33.692]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[02:32:33.772 --> 02:32:34.012]  Good.
[02:32:34.272 --> 02:32:35.594]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[02:32:35.754 --> 02:32:40.480]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:42.843]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[02:32:43.263 --> 02:32:45.644]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[02:32:45.984 --> 02:32:48.886]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[02:32:48.906 --> 02:32:50.386]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[02:32:50.406 --> 02:32:51.407]  BrainForce Plus.
[02:32:51.487 --> 02:32:54.468]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:54.588 --> 02:33:01.952]  And now, get BrainForce Plus at 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:05.674 --> 02:33:08.315]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.093 --> 02:33:15.094]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:15.194 --> 02:33:17.016]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:45.041]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com, the number one website in the world, it's independent and patriot.
[02:33:45.821 --> 02:33:47.782]  We can put it up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:33:47.802 --> 02:33:49.862]  I'm going to get to that after we finish with our guests and your calls.
[02:33:50.622 --> 02:33:58.244]  You will notice that Bezos Faces Trump's Wrath drops 40 plus billion today and it's still dropping.
[02:33:58.704 --> 02:34:03.845]  I've got some of the latest stock market numbers we're going to get to here in a few minutes.
[02:34:04.505 --> 02:34:07.886]  Bezos did special deals with Bill Clinton and then Obama.
[02:34:09.107 --> 02:34:23.197]  Where he gets $1.48 on every package, he gets a bunch of other stuff that's free, he gets to keep his money offshore, and he funds the Washington Post that calls me a snake oil salesman and is trying to shut down Infowars for selling supplements.
[02:34:23.217 --> 02:34:29.981]  18 of our supplements are brand-named for Amazon and are their best sellers and are excellent, by the way, and we sell them for less.
[02:34:32.523 --> 02:34:34.424]  It's just to show what a fraud Bezos is.
[02:34:34.964 --> 02:34:36.005]  I'm not tax exempt.
[02:34:36.125 --> 02:34:38.146]  I don't get $1.48 on every package like he does.
[02:34:39.046 --> 02:34:45.429]  And then he's got the Washington Post trying to shut us down, trying to harass us, saying shut down Infowars, trying to take our free speech.
[02:34:46.930 --> 02:34:48.491]  And he's selling the exact same stuff.
[02:34:48.691 --> 02:34:51.292]  I mean, just, he's a criminal in my view.
[02:34:53.193 --> 02:35:01.597]  And so, I said this two weeks ago from my White House sources who are just mid-level, but they heard it, that Alex, don't worry.
[02:35:05.467 --> 02:35:06.927]  God, I was told don't worry about John McCain.
[02:35:06.947 --> 02:35:08.448]  He was diagnosed with brain cancer two weeks later.
[02:35:09.848 --> 02:35:11.048]  And I'm not laughing about that.
[02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:12.849]  The point is, it just gets crazy.
[02:35:13.229 --> 02:35:17.010]  And I was told, you don't worry about Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:18.630]  Just watch what happens to Amazon.
[02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:20.030]  That was a couple months ago.
[02:35:21.151 --> 02:35:25.072]  And then I've been sitting back, and now, boy, we're seeing it, aren't we?
[02:35:25.792 --> 02:35:27.692]  So let's show DrudgeReport.com's front page.
[02:35:28.632 --> 02:35:33.494]  Amazon faces the wrath of Trump.
[02:35:33.554 --> 02:35:34.274]  Stocks plunge.
[02:35:35.390 --> 02:35:37.251]  We're going to tell you the inside baseball on that.
[02:35:38.331 --> 02:35:39.212]  But I mean, look.
[02:35:42.654 --> 02:35:44.034]  Bezos was given a chance.
[02:35:44.655 --> 02:35:46.996]  He's had four meetings with Trump that we know of.
[02:35:47.736 --> 02:35:48.717]  And he won't stop.
[02:35:50.257 --> 02:35:53.299]  He won't stop trying to overthrow the country and the First Amendment.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:55.920]  So, okay!
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:57.701]  You get what you want, brother.
[02:35:57.821 --> 02:35:59.142]  You get it now, don't you?
[02:35:59.802 --> 02:36:01.523]  We'll take you to zero if we have to.
[02:36:05.663 --> 02:36:09.725]  I have to say, I am enjoying this though, because Bezos is the worst.
[02:36:10.645 --> 02:36:19.869]  I don't know, Zuckerberg, gosh, see how Zuckerberg thought they'd put out that Analytica story that would not let conservatives have access to databases and not blow up in their face?
[02:36:20.189 --> 02:36:22.510]  These guys just aren't as smart as they think they are.
[02:36:25.291 --> 02:36:27.092]  Yeah, Trump hates Amazon, not Facebook.
[02:36:27.112 --> 02:36:29.333]  That's right, because he knows who's in his business.
[02:36:29.353 --> 02:36:31.594]  Let me tell you something, Zuckerberg's got problems.
[02:36:34.335 --> 02:36:35.856]  Notice I harp on Bezos all day.
[02:36:37.798 --> 02:36:39.600]  Because Bezos is the problem.
[02:36:40.561 --> 02:36:41.261]  He's the jerk.
[02:36:42.603 --> 02:36:46.506]  And he's the guy funding the leftist CIA, the breakaway groups.
[02:36:46.826 --> 02:36:47.767]  I mean, he's lucky.
[02:36:48.868 --> 02:36:51.230]  He's lucky he's not in an orange jumpsuit right now.
[02:36:51.931 --> 02:36:53.733]  Because he is an arrogant cuss.
[02:36:55.902 --> 02:36:56.522]  Have you ever seen him?
[02:36:56.562 --> 02:37:03.307]  He stopped the tickies to have these earlier interviews where he goes... This goofy thing he does everywhere.
[02:37:03.627 --> 02:37:07.049]  And it's a total cover for a flaming psychopath.
[02:37:07.770 --> 02:37:08.310]  In my opinion.
[02:37:10.712 --> 02:37:12.793]  So you keep doing your stuff, BZ.
[02:37:14.334 --> 02:37:16.596]  I mean, why would you take on an American recovery?
[02:37:16.636 --> 02:37:17.937]  He could get even richer in this.
[02:37:18.537 --> 02:37:19.097]  He doesn't care.
[02:37:21.539 --> 02:37:22.600]  So, going back to our guest.
[02:37:23.806 --> 02:37:29.710]  Shazia Hobbs leading the worldwide movement to stop genital mutilation of women under Islam.
[02:37:30.151 --> 02:37:38.036]  We're getting into the grooming, we're getting into, even the London Telegraph says it's a national security issue, that the royal family and all these elites have been caught connected to pedophilia.
[02:37:38.057 --> 02:37:41.659]  And I think that's why they're so allied with the worst elements of Islam.
[02:37:43.521 --> 02:37:46.483]  There's a lot of countries, you know, that weren't doing this to their women that are Islamic.
[02:37:47.125 --> 02:37:57.070]  Just because it's a smokescreen and a kind of mainlining and creating a system of little girls that the pedophiles who aren't Islamic can come be part of.
[02:37:57.090 --> 02:37:58.171]  I think that's what's going on.
[02:37:58.651 --> 02:38:00.072]  Any other key points you want to make?
[02:38:00.112 --> 02:38:01.632]  We salute you, Ms.
[02:38:01.652 --> 02:38:04.814]  Hobbs, for the work you do and everything you do and your courage.
[02:38:04.834 --> 02:38:07.055]  I know you get death threats, you've been banned on Twitter before.
[02:38:08.076 --> 02:38:11.277]  Any other key points you want to make and how do people support the work you're doing?
[02:38:15.806 --> 02:38:20.607]  I don't ask for any money or anything like that.
[02:38:20.627 --> 02:38:41.773]  I just think, speak out if you see it, if you see, you know, young girls, because we know that they target them outside kebab shops, that's like one of the places, kebab workers, taxi drivers, and if you see something and you think it doesn't look right, you know, young girls, they're usually 12, 13, 14,
[02:38:44.634 --> 02:38:56.442]  Hanging about with older men, Pakistani men, Muslim men, white men, you know, report it, do something, don't just ignore it.
[02:38:57.702 --> 02:39:03.406]  Yeah, they're just setting up the same harems they always do.
[02:39:03.466 --> 02:39:07.869]  I mean, you know, I mean, Mohammed had a nine-year-old in his harem, and that's liberal.
[02:39:07.889 --> 02:39:09.810]  I mean, Glorio Statham likes that, I guess.
[02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:11.071]  Yeah.
[02:39:12.296 --> 02:39:18.300]  I think, you know, what we were talking about earlier as well, before the break, that the raw is right at the top.
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:31.148]  So it starts right at the top with our elite, the British elite, you know, whether it's your politicians, lawyers, judges, very, very high up.
[02:39:31.168 --> 02:39:34.370]  They rape children, white men.
[02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:37.571]  And it goes right down to the bottom.
[02:39:38.071 --> 02:39:42.914]  And it goes on to the online street grooming with the Pakistani Muslim men.
[02:39:44.454 --> 02:39:46.916]  And it just, you know, how do we stop it?
[02:39:47.016 --> 02:39:47.336]  How?
[02:39:48.056 --> 02:39:49.997]  It's been allowed to go on for so long.
[02:39:50.017 --> 02:40:04.805]  And I think that we need to hold to account all of the children's safeguarding agencies, the police, you know, it's the more we hear about the rape gangs, and the more we hear, you know, that the police were involved as well.
[02:40:04.865 --> 02:40:04.985]  So
[02:40:05.706 --> 02:40:06.447]  Police are corrupt.
[02:40:06.547 --> 02:40:07.909]  Police are corrupt the world over.
[02:40:07.929 --> 02:40:12.496]  And I think, you know,
[02:40:14.238 --> 02:40:15.519]  We just need to revamp.
[02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:26.207]  It's like yous are doing in America, draining the swamp, and we need to get rid of all, every single person that failed children in the UK, and these rape gangs, social workers, the police.
[02:40:26.688 --> 02:40:28.669]  That's right, we need to drain the pedophile swamp.
[02:40:28.709 --> 02:40:29.370]  Beautifully said.
[02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:31.812]  Well, please join us again if you're ever in Austin.
[02:40:31.832 --> 02:40:34.013]  I hear you're in Texas part of the time.
[02:40:34.033 --> 02:40:35.695]  We'd love to have you in studio.
[02:40:35.715 --> 02:40:36.855]  We'd love to support your work.
[02:40:37.136 --> 02:40:38.737]  Love to have you be an auxiliary reporter.
[02:40:38.757 --> 02:40:43.741]  You know, if you've got a particular trip you want to do, or something you want to go investigate, I might, you know, try to finance that.
[02:40:44.738 --> 02:40:47.922]  You have a lot of courage with the work you've done and what you've gone through in the death threats.
[02:40:48.503 --> 02:40:51.888]  So we salute you and we thank you for the work you're doing.
[02:40:51.908 --> 02:40:54.231]  Again, we'll put up your Twitter, which was banned for a while.
[02:40:54.271 --> 02:40:56.334]  You're back now, so people can...
[02:40:57.754 --> 02:40:59.955]  Follow that right there for TV viewers.
[02:41:00.416 --> 02:41:03.417]  Again, that's Shazia Hobbs.
[02:41:04.938 --> 02:41:06.039]  At Shazia Hobbs.
[02:41:06.219 --> 02:41:12.242]  Shazia is S-H-A-Z-E-E-Y-A Hobbs.
[02:41:12.902 --> 02:41:17.005]  And it's just really critical to stand up for this lady and not let her be suppressed.
[02:41:17.365 --> 02:41:18.726]  So we salute you and God bless you.
[02:41:19.626 --> 02:41:19.986]  Thank you.
[02:41:21.067 --> 02:41:21.487]  Powerful.
[02:41:21.907 --> 02:41:26.070]  Alright, I'm going to come back and get into the whole Bezos thing briefly and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:41:27.103 --> 02:41:32.624]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, Cameron, Sham, Newman, Jeff, Debra.
[02:41:32.824 --> 02:41:33.904]  Debra's first when we come back.
[02:41:35.645 --> 02:41:41.486]  And we're probably going to get an exclusive pop-in from Tommy Robinson, banned completely off Twitter, like Milo Yiannopoulos was.
[02:41:42.006 --> 02:41:45.466]  This is an incredible time to be alive, but I'll tell Bezos and all of you something.
[02:41:47.647 --> 02:41:48.827]  This is a two-way street.
[02:41:50.747 --> 02:41:51.587]  And I'm not arrogant.
[02:41:51.967 --> 02:41:53.808]  I don't know if I'm personally going to win this.
[02:41:53.828 --> 02:41:55.628]  But see, it's not about me personally winning.
[02:41:58.234 --> 02:42:07.545]  I realize this injustice is going on and I realize the only reason I grew up somewhat free was because my forebearers were tough and didn't get pushed around and stood up for decency.
[02:42:08.566 --> 02:42:14.252]  And all the Michael Moores and all the Gloria Steinem's, everybody else has been covering up all this crap.
[02:42:14.813 --> 02:42:15.594]  You better know this.
[02:42:16.295 --> 02:42:17.136]  I know you're trash.
[02:42:18.117 --> 02:42:18.798]  I know you're filth.
[02:42:19.918 --> 02:42:33.601]  I know you're totally fake, psychopathic, people that have written off humanity, and think this is all cute and funny, and I'm sick of you moralizing and grandstanding about how you care about everybody, when everything you do is pure, stinking garbage.
[02:42:35.021 --> 02:42:42.122]  John, I just want you to know, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the Globalist, Michael Moore, Ward Rothschild, the Rockefellers, all of them, listen up.
[02:42:43.802 --> 02:42:45.503]  You hate everybody because you hate yourself.
[02:42:45.563 --> 02:42:46.023]  You're filth.
[02:42:46.383 --> 02:42:46.963]  You're garbage.
[02:42:48.191 --> 02:42:50.756]  So you want us to all exterminate ourselves and depopulate?
[02:42:50.776 --> 02:42:51.337]  I got an idea.
[02:42:51.958 --> 02:42:55.324]  How about you slit your own throat or jam some ice picks in your own eyes?
[02:42:55.805 --> 02:42:57.147]  How about you hang yourself tonight?
[02:42:58.203 --> 02:43:00.685]  If you want us to die, I say you need to die first.
[02:43:01.006 --> 02:43:01.606]  I curse you!
[02:43:02.066 --> 02:43:11.995]  My canary... Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:12.075 --> 02:43:20.122]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:20.462 --> 02:43:25.164]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:25.324 --> 02:43:32.047]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:32.127 --> 02:43:39.211]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:39.291 --> 02:43:46.154]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:46.314 --> 02:43:50.677]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.798 --> 02:43:54.060]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:44:00.325]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:44:00.485 --> 02:44:02.166]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:02.807 --> 02:44:03.427]  Don't thank me.
[02:44:03.487 --> 02:44:04.288]  I'm not a hero.
[02:44:04.528 --> 02:44:05.569]  I have seen the enemy.
[02:44:05.849 --> 02:44:06.930]  I know how evil they are.
[02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:08.091]  I know their commitment.
[02:44:08.291 --> 02:44:10.212]  The only way is to stand against them.
[02:44:10.512 --> 02:44:12.874]  And quite frankly, I am so honored to be under attack.
[02:44:13.174 --> 02:44:14.575]  I am so honored to be demonized.
[02:44:14.835 --> 02:44:20.559]  I am so honored to be one of their main enemies because that means I'm hurting them and I want to go on hurting them.
[02:44:22.196 --> 02:44:32.004]  When I tell our incredible viewers and listeners, please stop thanking me and gushing over me, it's not because I don't want to hear your praise, it's because I'm so humbled by you.
[02:44:32.805 --> 02:44:35.226]  You're the folks that are awake and have saw through the propaganda.
[02:44:35.467 --> 02:44:38.109]  You're the reason we can still stand against the globalists.
[02:44:38.209 --> 02:44:39.350]  You are the InfoWarp.
[02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:42.592]  And what I'm trying to say is, don't think of it
[02:44:43.513 --> 02:44:45.494]  That's heroic to fight the New World Order.
[02:44:46.235 --> 02:44:48.436]  Think of it as survival and a default.
[02:44:48.956 --> 02:44:58.841]  Don't think of it as Alex Jones, some hero out there on the front lines going through all these tribulations, and then you look at me as some unattainable, you know, superhero.
[02:44:58.961 --> 02:45:03.604]  I'm just an average guy that studied history and that wants to stand up against authoritarians like my ancestors.
[02:45:03.944 --> 02:45:06.465]  And you're just like me, and in many cases, better.
[02:45:06.545 --> 02:45:08.086]  Thanks for letting me say my piece, Alex.
[02:45:08.106 --> 02:45:08.607]  I really appreciate it.
[02:45:08.647 --> 02:45:09.907]  No, thank you, my friend.
[02:45:10.007 --> 02:45:11.208]  Look, we're all brothers in arms at this point.
[02:45:11.428 --> 02:45:14.150]  I'm a big fan of yours, and God bless you and your team.
[02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:15.191]  Don't thank me, brother.
[02:45:15.271 --> 02:45:15.771]  I get it.
[02:45:16.031 --> 02:45:17.832]  And you're the people that make the wheels turn.
[02:45:18.313 --> 02:45:19.713]  You got my respect all the way.
[02:45:19.954 --> 02:45:25.958]  From the farmers, to the mechanics, to the fishermen, to the police officers, to everybody else telling the truth and taking action.
[02:45:26.318 --> 02:45:27.178]  We are the people.
[02:45:27.258 --> 02:45:28.399]  We are America.
[02:45:28.459 --> 02:45:29.540]  This is what I was meant to do.
[02:45:29.700 --> 02:45:30.881]  I want to take the attach.
[02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:35.544]  I'm saying, though, when the enemy comes in, when evil comes in like a flood,
[02:45:36.044 --> 02:45:40.149]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it, and you are that standard.
[02:45:40.589 --> 02:45:46.175]  I'm only a focal point of somebody that understands, like somebody that's gotta swim in these boat wrecks.
[02:45:46.316 --> 02:45:50.320]  Somebody's gotta swim a hundred yards underwater to get out and get their kids out.
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.522]  They're not even good swimmers, but they're able to do it in the dark.
[02:45:53.203 --> 02:45:54.505]  It's like it's not courage.
[02:45:54.625 --> 02:45:58.651]  We're gonna die if we don't get through that damn bulkhead and get to the surface.
[02:45:59.272 --> 02:46:00.614]  You think I want to swim through these waters?
[02:46:00.874 --> 02:46:02.035]  You think I like what's going on?
[02:46:02.056 --> 02:46:03.397]  You think I personally enjoy it?
[02:46:03.798 --> 02:46:04.138]  I don't.
[02:46:04.559 --> 02:46:08.344]  But I realize I've got to do this or my family and your family's screwed.
[02:46:09.005 --> 02:46:10.446]  That's why I say, don't thank me.
[02:46:10.526 --> 02:46:11.307]  I'm not a hero.
[02:46:11.327 --> 02:46:12.467]  I don't have courage.
[02:46:12.487 --> 02:46:13.928]  I have seen the enemy.
[02:46:14.208 --> 02:46:15.289]  I know how evil they are.
[02:46:15.309 --> 02:46:16.470]  I know their commitment.
[02:46:16.650 --> 02:46:18.571]  The only way is to stand against them.
[02:46:18.731 --> 02:46:20.573]  So when you call in, celebrate humanity.
[02:46:20.893 --> 02:46:21.833]  Celebrate the awakening.
[02:46:22.234 --> 02:46:31.219]  And celebrate our own cultural and race consciousness of all humans to do better and move forward and defeat the technocrats and the anti-human globalists.
[02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:33.181]  This movement's awakening people worldwide.
[02:46:33.801 --> 02:46:34.862]  Incredible things are happening.
[02:46:35.343 --> 02:46:37.525]  Major governments now realize what's happening.
[02:46:37.986 --> 02:46:39.407]  The worm's turning.
[02:46:39.427 --> 02:46:40.068]  The fight's on.
[02:46:40.709 --> 02:46:41.730]  The empire's striking back.
[02:46:42.471 --> 02:46:44.072]  So let me do this right now.
[02:46:44.092 --> 02:46:47.356]  I want to thank you for being conscious and you for being awake.
[02:46:47.376 --> 02:46:49.778]  And I want to thank you for giving my family a future.
[02:46:49.898 --> 02:46:52.061]  Because we are all in this together.
[02:47:06.644 --> 02:47:11.265]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.508 --> 02:47:26.068]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:26.088 --> 02:47:27.068]  Your call's coming up.
[02:47:28.068 --> 02:47:35.030]  I'm gonna cut us into the next hour, but... I cannot believe the incredible White House information I'm given.
[02:47:37.799 --> 02:47:40.442]  Man, it's just, it's just been dead on accurate.
[02:47:41.363 --> 02:47:45.989]  In fact, I meant to mention this earlier before I get into Bezos and the fact that they're 40 billion down.
[02:47:47.629 --> 02:47:57.078]  And Axios breaks it down that he sees Bezos as his enemy, the Washington Post as a political weapon, he knows Bezos is funding leftist groups.
[02:47:57.438 --> 02:48:01.642]  Well yeah, Bezos is probably behind the scenes doing more funding than Soros right now.
[02:48:02.202 --> 02:48:10.350]  And just because he does that whole fake nice guy act, just because one eye doesn't point the right direction, like a little magic trick, doesn't mean we gotta roll over to Bezos.
[02:48:11.070 --> 02:48:12.532]  America built you, boy!
[02:48:13.604 --> 02:48:15.866]  Now you're getting all this free tax money, all this stuff.
[02:48:16.566 --> 02:48:17.587]  It's the end of the road.
[02:48:19.228 --> 02:48:22.210]  And this is definitely a message to Google and Facebook and everybody else.
[02:48:25.533 --> 02:48:31.177]  So, notice everything you guys does, everything you do blows up in your face.
[02:48:31.217 --> 02:48:37.101]  Like, oh, we're gonna ban the Second Amendment, and like three days later, we didn't mean that, stop, oh my, we're down 10 points of the polls or more.
[02:48:39.083 --> 02:48:40.804]  America doesn't like you.
[02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:44.000]  I don't like you either.
[02:48:47.501 --> 02:48:49.501]  I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
[02:48:49.621 --> 02:48:49.801]  No.
[02:48:50.521 --> 02:48:50.982]  Seriously.
[02:48:51.802 --> 02:48:53.942]  This is just getting more and more insane.
[02:48:54.442 --> 02:48:55.502]  Just stop it.
[02:48:55.942 --> 02:49:00.343]  But see, America's the big bear or the moose that the hunters want to mount.
[02:49:00.363 --> 02:49:01.023]  It's like the elephant.
[02:49:01.344 --> 02:49:05.204]  If we could just get America and run it, we'd... Stop trying to run it.
[02:49:05.444 --> 02:49:05.984]  Love it.
[02:49:06.405 --> 02:49:07.305]  Turn it loose.
[02:49:07.905 --> 02:49:08.445]  Ride it.
[02:49:09.722 --> 02:49:10.343]  Write it!
[02:49:11.103 --> 02:49:12.144]  Like Trump wants to do.
[02:49:12.204 --> 02:49:14.585]  Don't try to get a tiger by the tail.
[02:49:16.687 --> 02:49:20.089]  I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see.
[02:49:22.611 --> 02:49:25.753]  There won't be much left of me when you're few with me.
[02:49:27.654 --> 02:49:31.817]  Now, let's get serious here, because I want to hit this and then move on to your calls.
[02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:37.081]  We are at a historic crossroads.
[02:49:39.557 --> 02:49:44.481]  And it's up to all of us to stay politically active and not let their intimidation get to us.
[02:49:44.501 --> 02:49:48.304]  People go, well, if I speak out, I'll get sued like you or I'll get demonized.
[02:49:48.704 --> 02:49:53.028]  We're not trying to personally always worry about ourselves.
[02:49:54.929 --> 02:49:59.333]  Because if we don't stop worrying, we will lose everything.
[02:49:59.433 --> 02:50:00.914]  You ever figure that out?
[02:50:01.275 --> 02:50:04.097]  See, it's a paradox of my extreme selfishness.
[02:50:07.054 --> 02:50:11.155]  Acting like cowards and rolling over to any pressure is what creates slavery.
[02:50:12.315 --> 02:50:13.515]  It's what creates entropy.
[02:50:13.935 --> 02:50:15.296]  It's what creates stagnation.
[02:50:15.596 --> 02:50:18.856]  It's what creates Venezuela or North Korea.
[02:50:19.436 --> 02:50:21.097]  You don't want that.
[02:50:22.197 --> 02:50:24.537]  You want real change.
[02:50:24.577 --> 02:50:25.838]  You want real debate.
[02:50:26.178 --> 02:50:27.438]  You want real diversity.
[02:50:27.758 --> 02:50:28.998]  Globalism is not diversity.
[02:50:29.078 --> 02:50:33.239]  It's centralized brainwashing and a bunch of groups played off against each other.
[02:50:36.673 --> 02:50:37.874]  And so it's a process.
[02:50:40.137 --> 02:50:51.989]  And we've got Jeff Bezos waging a war against free speech, waging a war against America, waging a war against our recovery.
[02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:54.311]  You've got Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs.
[02:50:54.351 --> 02:50:55.072]  Notice he's out.
[02:50:55.652 --> 02:50:59.657]  He was tweeting six months ago, America will never recover, and laughing.
[02:51:00.822 --> 02:51:03.763]  I'm surprised he didn't get cement shoes for that type of stuff!
[02:51:04.023 --> 02:51:15.046]  And I'm not into that, but I mean, when you're trying to destroy a country, and betting against it with a Chinese communist, who don't care about their people and sell Christians organs, you've signed on to some evil stuff!
[02:51:15.366 --> 02:51:19.907]  So I'm not gonna cry behind the barn at night, if something happens to you.
[02:51:20.007 --> 02:51:23.608]  And I'm not threatening anybody, I'm saying you guys don't get
[02:51:25.148 --> 02:51:36.193]  That a free country gives you an atmosphere to be free and do stuff, and that getting rid of the atmosphere, because you want to dominate people the short term, it will end up eating you in the end.
[02:51:37.994 --> 02:51:41.196]  People have chivalry because they didn't want their wives and children being targeted.
[02:51:41.836 --> 02:51:47.599]  You guys go, let's just get rid of chivalry and start targeting people's wives and children, until it happens to you!
[02:51:48.359 --> 02:51:48.699]  Idiot!
[02:51:49.199 --> 02:51:52.001]  What you don't think, we don't know how to go after your wives and children?
[02:51:53.237 --> 02:51:54.258]  Or that we're scared to?
[02:51:54.818 --> 02:51:55.739]  You moron!
[02:51:55.759 --> 02:51:57.840]  You idiot!
[02:51:58.921 --> 02:52:00.022]  We have rules!
[02:52:00.302 --> 02:52:02.303]  It's called civilization, fool!
[02:52:05.745 --> 02:52:08.447]  Because if men want to kill each other for power, that's one thing.
[02:52:08.807 --> 02:52:10.889]  But why not leave the infrastructure?
[02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:17.712]  But see, you've got an anti-human bent, so you don't like seeing infrastructure, because you don't like competition.
[02:52:18.112 --> 02:52:25.775]  People like Bezos sees you're a good-looking wife, you're a good-looking husband, you're a nice family, you're upwardly mobile, you don't need him, and he feels bad.
[02:52:26.135 --> 02:52:27.815]  He wants to run you!
[02:52:28.096 --> 02:52:29.616]  He wants to break you!
[02:52:29.916 --> 02:52:32.197]  Because he's a fallen bad person!
[02:52:34.178 --> 02:52:35.398]  He is a piece of crap!
[02:52:36.358 --> 02:52:37.219]  He is cancer!
[02:52:37.919 --> 02:52:38.879]  So is Zuckerberg!
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:40.300]  So are these other people!
[02:52:41.578 --> 02:52:44.179]  And they gotta be dealt with, and dealt with strongly.
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:49.060]  So, you wanna fight?
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:50.861]  Better believe you got one, jackasses.
[02:52:51.321 --> 02:52:56.802]  And if you don't think Trump doesn't have a bunch of other stuff up his sleeve, that's why they've been so scared.
[02:52:57.902 --> 02:53:03.164]  He just tried to get them to roll over and become even richer and be... They don't want you to have any of the money.
[02:53:05.163 --> 02:53:07.026]  All these globalists want you poor.
[02:53:07.106 --> 02:53:08.929]  They don't want to share any of it.
[02:53:09.329 --> 02:53:11.353]  They don't think your wealth makes them richer.
[02:53:11.493 --> 02:53:12.034]  They're idiots.
[02:53:12.514 --> 02:53:17.141]  They fundamentally are missing something which allows them to get into positions of power.
[02:53:19.838 --> 02:53:23.720]  But just like, again, cancer can take over the body because it isn't in symbiosis.
[02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:26.141]  It isn't working with everybody else.
[02:53:26.441 --> 02:53:26.981]  It isn't 360.
[02:53:27.101 --> 02:53:28.962]  It isn't non-zero-sum game.
[02:53:29.302 --> 02:53:30.222]  It's not harmonic.
[02:53:30.523 --> 02:53:31.383]  It's not connected.
[02:53:31.583 --> 02:53:32.383]  It's not balanced.
[02:53:32.523 --> 02:53:33.204]  It's bad.
[02:53:33.364 --> 02:53:33.924]  It's evil.
[02:53:34.184 --> 02:53:34.724]  It's filthy.
[02:53:34.964 --> 02:53:35.605]  It smells.
[02:53:35.945 --> 02:53:36.665]  It doesn't work.
[02:53:37.005 --> 02:53:38.666]  It brings you failure.
[02:53:40.767 --> 02:53:42.668]  Of the general species and everything around us.
[02:53:44.809 --> 02:53:45.329]  Like China.
[02:53:47.048 --> 02:53:49.090]  So Trump hates Amazon, not Facebook.
[02:53:49.170 --> 02:53:51.712]  No, he's just going after Facebook later.
[02:53:54.414 --> 02:53:55.575]  Oh, Axios.
[02:53:56.035 --> 02:53:59.058]  They knew that Politico was discredited.
[02:54:00.059 --> 02:54:01.260]  So now they're Axios.
[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:02.401]  Oh, it doesn't sound establishment.
[02:54:02.441 --> 02:54:03.442]  It's Axios.
[02:54:04.763 --> 02:54:06.104]  They're going to tell me how it works.
[02:54:06.404 --> 02:54:07.625]  Oh, Axios, tell me.
[02:54:09.346 --> 02:54:12.009]  Do you remember on
[02:54:13.928 --> 02:54:15.590]  March 8th, it got published on March 9th.
[02:54:16.271 --> 02:54:17.912]  That is almost three weeks ago.
[02:54:17.932 --> 02:54:26.361]  I said I talked to sources and that Kim Jong-un already agreed to the framework of giving up the nukes and everything else before Trump even agrees to meet with him.
[02:54:26.601 --> 02:54:29.925]  That may mean he still may try to back out, but they already have an agreement before this happened.
[02:54:33.047 --> 02:54:35.689]  What was then announced today CNBC?
[02:54:36.130 --> 02:54:48.340]  China claims Kim Jong-un has agreed to denuclearize Korean Peninsula and has already agreed to all of the requests but they want an economic package and a plan to merge the north and south in the next 10 years.
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:59.449]  You got the news three weeks before because I got it directly because they know we're under attack and we get little pieces of news so that folks don't know we're for real.
[02:55:00.273 --> 02:55:05.777]  So, next week, next month's news today, here's a clip from back in March 9th.
[02:55:05.857 --> 02:55:11.561]  It's on Infowars.com, where we laid it all out for you, and now it's all confirmed.
[02:55:11.581 --> 02:55:12.742]  Here it is.
[02:55:12.762 --> 02:55:13.663]  So, here's the statement.
[02:55:14.703 --> 02:55:19.527]  Kim Jong-un has already tacitly agreed to the terms of the Trump meeting.
[02:55:19.847 --> 02:55:25.311]  Trump's not going to go to that meeting without getting an agreement, and without having it be ironclad.
[02:55:25.351 --> 02:55:27.092]  He's not going to go there and not have the victory.
[02:55:30.580 --> 02:55:33.982]  And then I go on for another 10 minutes breaking them down.
[02:55:52.105 --> 02:55:53.385]  So, there you go.
[02:55:53.826 --> 02:55:54.426]  We're going to go to break.
[02:55:54.446 --> 02:55:55.326]  Come back when your phone calls.
[02:55:55.386 --> 02:55:56.366]  Deborah, I'm going to write to you.
[02:55:56.426 --> 02:55:58.567]  Jeff, Sam, Cameron.
[02:55:58.587 --> 02:55:59.027]  But you know what?
[02:55:59.047 --> 02:55:59.848]  I have this new rule.
[02:55:59.868 --> 02:56:01.208]  You hold an hour, you get a free t-shirt.
[02:56:01.668 --> 02:56:03.909]  So, it's hard for the crew to do it, but please get their names and numbers.
[02:56:04.789 --> 02:56:07.450]  Let them, you know, tell us what t-shirt they want or have the crew call them.
[02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:11.572]  And it's a free t-shirt or a free bottle of Brain Force.
[02:56:12.612 --> 02:56:13.752]  That's 50% off right now.
[02:56:13.772 --> 02:56:16.233]  And we appreciate you holding so long.
[02:56:16.253 --> 02:56:17.874]  But I did get eight or nine calls earlier.
[02:56:17.894 --> 02:56:19.474]  And I'm trying to get calls in every day.
[02:56:19.514 --> 02:56:21.335]  And at least I've made that promise come true.
[02:56:22.631 --> 02:56:24.112]  Just so much news to get to.
[02:56:24.132 --> 02:56:26.613]  You know, I'm not vindictive against Bezos.
[02:56:26.673 --> 02:56:34.156]  He just, he's this sociopath, grew up in America, fake liberal, a psychopath, and he thinks everybody doesn't see what he's doing.
[02:56:34.636 --> 02:56:37.698]  And then he's finally, they're getting the fact that we're coming after him.
[02:56:39.138 --> 02:56:46.101]  And then I'm sorry, you're like this twisted, weird, beta alpha male, and you've gotta mount our heads on the walls to feel big.
[02:56:46.181 --> 02:56:47.802]  It's just, you can't, Bezos.
[02:56:48.262 --> 02:56:48.682]  You can't.
[02:56:49.162 --> 02:56:50.143]  And I've told everybody I know.
[02:56:51.581 --> 02:56:56.244]  Yeah, you may buy 5-10% ordering something from somebody direct, but my God, you build your whole future.
[02:56:56.264 --> 02:56:58.105]  And people go, well, why are you on Amazon?
[02:56:58.145 --> 02:57:00.507]  Because then we can't stop the counterfeits from being on it.
[02:57:00.527 --> 02:57:02.148]  We don't promote the fact we sell stuff on Amazon.
[02:57:02.408 --> 02:57:04.649]  We're just there contractually so we can control our goods on there.
[02:57:05.050 --> 02:57:06.510]  Infoworkstore.com is where you get it.
[02:57:07.571 --> 02:57:09.712]  50% off on the Real Red pill.
[02:57:09.793 --> 02:57:10.353]  It's amazing.
[02:57:10.373 --> 02:57:11.434]  It goes great with Brain Force.
[02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:12.174]  That's 50% off.
[02:57:12.594 --> 02:57:13.995]  They're both 50% off by themselves.
[02:57:14.035 --> 02:57:14.796]  Get them together.
[02:57:16.069 --> 02:57:18.671]  They're 50% off, but you get free shipping on top of it.
[02:57:19.051 --> 02:57:20.552]  It is the Mind and Body Challenge Pack.
[02:57:20.913 --> 02:57:23.515]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:23.695 --> 02:57:27.818]  And no reviews yet, because we just launched this special yesterday.
[02:57:27.838 --> 02:57:30.660]  But Brain Force may even sell out by next week.
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:32.081]  So I don't know how long this special can run.
[02:57:32.521 --> 02:57:34.263]  And your purchase makes it all possible.
[02:57:34.283 --> 02:57:37.905]  So when you're at InfoWarsStore.com, check out the thousands of other great items.
[02:57:37.965 --> 02:57:42.829]  Because unlike Bezos, we're rooting for America and free market and a future.
[02:57:43.330 --> 02:57:46.976]  We're not a transhumanist globalist allied with China and everybody else.
[02:57:47.738 --> 02:57:49.320]  They call us schmucks, by the way, because of that.
[02:57:49.341 --> 02:57:50.002]  They think I'm an idiot.
[02:57:52.407 --> 02:57:53.828]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:57:54.008 --> 02:57:56.428]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[02:57:56.588 --> 02:58:03.891]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:58:04.091 --> 02:58:14.394]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:58:14.734 --> 02:58:22.316]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:58:22.576 --> 02:58:32.519]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:58:32.779 --> 02:58:34.720]  And this part is most important.
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:41.262]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:58:41.642 --> 02:58:42.723]  That means it's clean.
[02:58:43.063 --> 02:58:44.084]  That means it's pure.
[02:58:44.204 --> 02:58:47.005]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:58:47.105 --> 02:58:49.707]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:49.887 --> 02:58:51.528]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:58:52.403 --> 02:58:55.845]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[02:58:56.166 --> 02:59:02.910]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:59:03.210 --> 02:59:07.954]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[02:59:07.974 --> 02:59:08.474]  It's very simple.
[02:59:08.714 --> 02:59:10.856]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[02:59:11.216 --> 02:59:13.057]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[02:59:13.157 --> 02:59:16.019]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[02:59:16.840 --> 02:59:18.921]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[02:59:19.001 --> 02:59:19.602]  It's $19.95 right now.
[02:59:21.803 --> 02:59:24.704]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[02:59:25.024 --> 02:59:28.984]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[02:59:29.285 --> 02:59:33.085]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[02:59:33.125 --> 02:59:36.566]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[02:59:37.006 --> 02:59:39.927]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[02:59:40.167 --> 02:59:43.567]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[02:59:43.807 --> 02:59:46.108]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[02:59:46.408 --> 02:59:47.088]  It's amazing.
[02:59:47.408 --> 02:59:49.849]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:56.952 --> 03:00:00.614]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:00.834 --> 03:00:02.235]  He never gives up.
[03:00:02.355 --> 03:00:06.338]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.698 --> 03:00:12.501]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:00:12.621 --> 03:00:14.823]  Worldwide.
[03:00:28.069 --> 03:00:29.350]  All right, Roger Stokes coming up.
[03:00:29.390 --> 03:00:38.275]  He's got the inside doo-doo on Trump coming out and going, hey, look at Amazon's building a house of cards, a taxpayer money.
[03:00:38.875 --> 03:00:39.836]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:00:39.916 --> 03:00:41.777]  We're taking your phone calls right now, though.
[03:00:42.478 --> 03:00:44.599]  Deborah in Nebraska, the great state of Nebraska.
[03:00:44.619 --> 03:00:45.639]  That's where my wife's from.
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:47.360]  Corn-fed beauty.
[03:00:48.501 --> 03:00:50.042]  Deborah, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:00:50.082 --> 03:00:50.442]  Go ahead.
[03:00:51.683 --> 03:00:52.303]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:52.403 --> 03:00:53.444]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:00:53.784 --> 03:00:54.945]  I'm from Omaha.
[03:00:55.872 --> 03:01:00.493]  Um, and I would like to put a challenge out to all the women patriots out there.
[03:01:01.013 --> 03:01:05.954]  If you are in a state where you can open carry your handgun, you need to open carry that handgun.
[03:01:06.814 --> 03:01:13.676]  As a woman, I cannot tell you how many times I have had other women come up to me and say, hey, how are you allowed to do that?
[03:01:14.776 --> 03:01:15.316]  Exactly!
[03:01:15.336 --> 03:01:19.577]  They've created with Hollywood, like everything based in New York or whatever, where guns are banned.
[03:01:19.857 --> 03:01:23.878]  And by openly doing it, it's one of the most revolutionary things you can do.
[03:01:25.305 --> 03:01:26.025]  Exactly.
[03:01:26.045 --> 03:01:33.128]  And I mean, I had one conversation with a woman and she was just curious.
[03:01:33.708 --> 03:01:35.729]  She said, well, why don't you conceal that?
[03:01:35.989 --> 03:01:37.310]  Why don't you have it under your coat?
[03:01:37.930 --> 03:01:39.571]  And I said, well, let me ask you this.
[03:01:40.251 --> 03:01:51.015]  I said, if you and I were to walk out in the parking lot right now and there was a psycho nut job in the parking lot that was looking for a woman to kidnap and rape out of the two of us, who do you think he's going to pick?
[03:01:51.995 --> 03:01:53.756]  And there was this long pause.
[03:01:54.403 --> 03:01:58.904]  And you could almost hear the click in her brain and she said, well, it's not going to be you.
[03:01:59.184 --> 03:02:00.504]  And I said, exactly.
[03:02:01.144 --> 03:02:03.805]  I only need to be a harder target than one other person.
[03:02:05.425 --> 03:02:09.446]  Well, we have to get in the position of, it's not who's carrying a gun openly you got to worry about.
[03:02:09.466 --> 03:02:11.446]  It's the nut job.
[03:02:11.886 --> 03:02:13.666]  It's always some nut job on drugs.
[03:02:13.726 --> 03:02:16.327]  It's always some nut job the police knew about and couldn't bust.
[03:02:16.907 --> 03:02:18.347]  It's always the stand down.
[03:02:18.887 --> 03:02:19.848]  And it's the same story.
[03:02:19.868 --> 03:02:21.908]  But absolutely, I feel good.
[03:02:22.915 --> 03:02:24.036]  We had an open carry march.
[03:02:24.156 --> 03:02:28.179]  I feel good, and statistically, it's come out now.
[03:02:28.219 --> 03:02:31.922]  We've got, what, 25 years of concealed carry or more, starting in Florida and other areas?
[03:02:32.763 --> 03:02:43.671]  Crime drops 30-40% within a few years, and concealed carry owners, because people are all about honor, they're the type that actually go and do it, they have the lowest crime rate of any group, no matter what color they are.
[03:02:43.691 --> 03:02:43.951]  Duh!
[03:02:45.132 --> 03:02:46.933]  The lowest crime rate is concealed carry.
[03:02:46.973 --> 03:02:47.873]  That is a fact!
[03:02:48.033 --> 03:02:48.613]  Exactly!
[03:02:49.054 --> 03:02:53.055]  Good people outnumber bad people 99 to 1!
[03:02:53.515 --> 03:03:05.860]  And it's time for us to get that and with little piglet hog and all the rest of these people get up there as public figures and want to take my free speech when I criticize them to hell with them and they trying to project on me?
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:07.601]  It's like I own a Ford truck.
[03:03:08.598 --> 03:03:12.140]  Well, I know one of the jihadis in Europe used a Ford truck to run people over.
[03:03:12.561 --> 03:03:20.006]  If somebody called me up and said, Alex, you got a Ford truck, and this jihadi just ran over 100 people, I'd say, are you joking?
[03:03:20.566 --> 03:03:23.508]  Again, Louisville Sluggers kill hundreds of people a year.
[03:03:24.209 --> 03:03:30.273]  If I got a Louisville Slugger, which I do, being my son at baseball's backyard, is that Louisville Slugger's fault?
[03:03:30.493 --> 03:03:31.794]  What's the answer, Debra?
[03:03:33.075 --> 03:03:33.956]  No, absolutely not.
[03:03:34.944 --> 03:03:35.885]  Absolutely not.
[03:03:36.025 --> 03:03:39.189]  Again, are we going to blame spoons for making people fat?
[03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:42.733]  Are you going to blame the pencil for making the mistakes?
[03:03:43.594 --> 03:03:44.595]  Seriously, come on.
[03:03:45.216 --> 03:03:49.942]  But as a woman open carrying a gun, that opens up the conversation to other women.
[03:03:51.041 --> 03:03:52.442]  A woman is not going to oppress a man.
[03:03:52.482 --> 03:03:53.042]  No, I totally agree.
[03:03:53.142 --> 03:03:53.863]  I totally agree.
[03:03:53.923 --> 03:03:54.503]  Women need to do it.
[03:03:54.563 --> 03:03:55.104]  And here's the thing.
[03:03:55.424 --> 03:03:57.005]  They act like men are trying to suppress women.
[03:03:57.325 --> 03:04:01.788]  As a father of three girls, nothing... I love it when my girls want to take Jiu-Jitsu.
[03:04:02.108 --> 03:04:04.029]  I love it when they go, Daddy, I want to go shooting.
[03:04:04.189 --> 03:04:05.050]  I love that!
[03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.831]  I love it!
[03:04:05.871 --> 03:04:07.111]  That is an instinct.
[03:04:07.231 --> 03:04:10.974]  I want my girls as beautiful, smart, and as mean as they can be.
[03:04:15.609 --> 03:04:16.069]  Absolutely.
[03:04:16.510 --> 03:04:17.751]  I had talked to one girl.
[03:04:17.791 --> 03:04:20.252]  She came up to me and she goes, well, I have a restraining order.
[03:04:20.753 --> 03:04:22.994]  I'm like, baby, that's just piece of paper.
[03:04:23.054 --> 03:04:24.615]  It is not going to stop a gun or a knife.
[03:04:25.176 --> 03:04:26.117]  You need to get a gun.
[03:04:26.297 --> 03:04:27.217]  I said, do you have a gun?
[03:04:27.277 --> 03:04:28.018]  And she goes, no.
[03:04:28.078 --> 03:04:29.239]  I'm like, why don't you have a gun?
[03:04:29.259 --> 03:04:30.620]  She goes, well, I don't know how to get one.
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:34.823]  So I spent 30 minutes explaining to her, here's how you get your purchase permit.
[03:04:35.143 --> 03:04:36.484]  Here's how you get a concealed carry.
[03:04:36.764 --> 03:04:38.205]  Here's where you can take classes.
[03:04:38.846 --> 03:04:41.868]  You know, you need to protect yourself because the police
[03:04:42.805 --> 03:04:45.188]  Well, and think about if all the women patriots out there were to...

[03:06:19.446 --> 03:06:20.887]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:21.147 --> 03:06:22.307]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:22.827 --> 03:06:27.529]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.109 --> 03:06:37.372]  You know, the motto of the Special Air Services in the UK, the motto of special forces around the world today, is fortune favors the bold.
[03:06:38.339 --> 03:06:42.643]  There's another saying, nobody knows who said it posthumously, but no guts, no glory.
[03:06:43.383 --> 03:06:44.845]  Well, I'm not looking for red carpets.
[03:06:45.425 --> 03:06:46.686]  I'm not looking for jet airplanes.
[03:06:47.066 --> 03:06:49.969]  I'm not looking for people to kiss my old, ugly butt.
[03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:54.172]  But what I am looking for is living my own life.
[03:06:54.232 --> 03:07:01.599]  And all these control freaks and people that want to run my life, want to run your life, I say it's open season on them.
[03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:12.377]  Intellectually, culturally, economically, and if they jump across that line, and they pull the first punch, and they draw the first blood, then we give them everything they want.
[03:07:12.918 --> 03:07:22.365]  And it'll just be like rowing a boat up and down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
[03:07:23.505 --> 03:07:26.988]  Because the tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[03:07:31.443 --> 03:07:38.046]  As strong as the enemy is, they're only strong in their will to be evil.
[03:07:38.106 --> 03:07:39.947]  We are strong in our will to be just.
[03:07:40.428 --> 03:07:41.848]  And we're building a future world.
[03:07:42.208 --> 03:07:43.429]  Now, we ran into that break.
[03:07:44.069 --> 03:07:44.910]  Bumper music didn't fire.
[03:07:44.930 --> 03:07:45.270]  It's fine.
[03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:46.270]  Sorry I cut you off, ma'am.
[03:07:46.951 --> 03:07:48.011]  Deborah, finishing your point.
[03:07:48.612 --> 03:07:49.192]  Absolutely.
[03:07:49.252 --> 03:07:50.793]  What you're saying is what might judge.
[03:07:52.293 --> 03:07:53.994]  And I tell the story because I'm just so busy.
[03:07:54.014 --> 03:07:55.215]  Just like four years ago,
[03:07:57.090 --> 03:07:59.492]  Was the first time I did it, and like three years ago was the last time I did it.
[03:07:59.512 --> 03:08:03.735]  I did it a few, four or five times with him, and it was so much fun to go out to his ranch north of Austin.
[03:08:04.235 --> 03:08:08.538]  Big house, big, big deck all around it, and shooting firearms.
[03:08:08.578 --> 03:08:13.222]  And he brought the whole cast of Silicon Valley to it once, and he brought the cast to another movie to it.
[03:08:14.096 --> 03:08:18.900]  And these people were shaking when we had 50 cows and 223s and you know, M4s and everything.
[03:08:19.381 --> 03:08:30.850]  And within 30 minutes we had these girls, these ladies, um, these starlets, shooting bullseye at 100 and 200 yards and going, whoa, I'm a good person.
[03:08:30.910 --> 03:08:31.711]  I'm not going to kill anybody.
[03:08:32.031 --> 03:08:32.552]  Whoa.
[03:08:32.612 --> 03:08:33.613]  It was, it was crazy.
[03:08:34.653 --> 03:08:37.636]  And he looked at me and he said, this is how I convert people.
[03:08:39.818 --> 03:08:41.419]  And he said, you know, and I said, can I say that story?
[03:08:41.439 --> 03:08:42.600]  He goes, yeah, yeah, you can say that story.
[03:08:43.401 --> 03:08:47.404]  And he said, this is Håkon Vernum, Critter King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt, all that stuff.
[03:08:47.845 --> 03:08:49.126]  He's one of the biggest producers ever.
[03:08:49.146 --> 03:08:51.268]  He's made like $7 million in production.
[03:08:51.488 --> 03:08:52.469]  It's almost as big as Spielberg.
[03:08:52.509 --> 03:08:54.550]  But the point is, he's a very humble guy.
[03:08:54.771 --> 03:08:56.312]  You know, he was the top engineer on the F-18.
[03:08:56.532 --> 03:09:05.880]  He made money off that almost 30 years ago and left with that money and set up what he really wanted to do, animation.
[03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:07.141]  So that's how smart my judge is.
[03:09:07.561 --> 03:09:07.822]  Anyways.
[03:09:09.042 --> 03:09:14.669]  I'm not trying to kiss Mike Judge's butt, but like, photogenically, he kind of looks like a nerd on photos, but personally, he looks like Bruce Willis.
[03:09:14.729 --> 03:09:17.932]  But anyways, and nothing makes the girls more excited, too.
[03:09:18.032 --> 03:09:22.257]  I mean, you know, I was in the middle of a divorce then, so I was a good boy, let me tell you.
[03:09:22.878 --> 03:09:28.384]  But, you know, you get out there with the girls, shoot some guns, and have some beer, and eat some barbecue out in the country, it's a good night.
[03:09:29.145 --> 03:09:36.430]  So, that conversion of those people in 30 minutes each time that we did it was incredible.
[03:09:37.090 --> 03:09:42.394]  And so, that's exactly what Debra's saying, but a lot of women are kind of creeped out by men, and I don't blame them.
[03:09:42.934 --> 03:09:43.755]  I'm creeped out by men.
[03:09:46.357 --> 03:09:57.744]  And so, we need to have you go out and basically show the religion of self-defense and self-empowerment, and there's nothing more human than that, than not being a victim.
[03:09:57.784 --> 03:09:58.645]  Is that what you're saying, Debra?
[03:09:59.719 --> 03:10:01.101]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:10:01.902 --> 03:10:05.548]  You know, I feel very safe.
[03:10:06.184 --> 03:10:09.925]  When I'm carrying my gun because I'm like five foot nothing, way about 120.
[03:10:10.325 --> 03:10:12.146]  So I'm a little person.
[03:10:13.547 --> 03:10:19.689]  And to be out at night, it's very empowering to have my gun and have people know that I have my gun.
[03:10:20.129 --> 03:10:28.792]  I mean, I was walking to my car one night and two guys came up and they saw me and they're kind of, you know, joking with each other going, hey, she's got a gun.
[03:10:28.832 --> 03:10:29.872]  We're not going to mess with her.
[03:10:30.312 --> 03:10:31.493]  I'm like, yeah, that's a good plan.
[03:10:31.513 --> 03:10:32.373]  You better keep walking.
[03:10:35.874 --> 03:10:37.914]  That gun is the equalizer for women.
[03:10:39.755 --> 03:10:40.515]  Plain and simple.
[03:10:40.855 --> 03:10:41.515]  Yeah!
[03:10:41.875 --> 03:10:48.356]  And then the feminists run around and say, take guns from women is the most asinine load of baloney I've ever heard in my life.
[03:10:48.997 --> 03:10:53.877]  And I just tell you, the funnest thing is hearing my older daughter say, Daddy, Daddy, I want to go shooting some more.
[03:10:54.638 --> 03:10:57.898]  And, you know, I'm sitting back in the backyard shooting bows and arrows and BB guns.
[03:10:58.858 --> 03:11:00.239]  And it's just the best thing on earth.
[03:11:00.659 --> 03:11:01.559]  And how the left
[03:11:02.788 --> 03:11:04.669]  Each generation gets more domesticated.
[03:11:04.689 --> 03:11:05.750]  Thank you so much, Deborah.
[03:11:05.770 --> 03:11:06.230]  Great points.
[03:11:06.270 --> 03:11:06.810]  God bless you.
[03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:14.274]  And by the way, she held for over an hour and a half, so get her name and number, and let's send her a free t-shirt or something, because that's what we're doing here.
[03:11:15.855 --> 03:11:18.836]  Let's bring Roger Stone in here, and we'll continue with phone calls, because he wants to take calls.
[03:11:18.996 --> 03:11:26.540]  Roger, I remember talking to another source in Congress about a month ago, and he said, Alex, trust Trump.
[03:11:29.822 --> 03:11:31.863]  I had just talked to Ted Nugent.
[03:11:32.819 --> 03:11:47.172]  And he had said, talked about some private meetings, and I'll leave it at that, he said, you want to talk to this person, and I'd never talked to this individual before about who they were, and I talked to him, it was an off-record meeting, and they said, listen, Trump's for real, he's suckering them on the guns, he just wants them to come out and be anti-gun and say they want to ban the Second Amendment.
[03:11:47.692 --> 03:11:58.642]  And I remember those conversations with Nugent and others, and then it happens a month later, and I'm going, okay, I don't want to put, like, some mantle on Trump of, like, 40 chests, but now I'm starting to buy that.
[03:12:03.390 --> 03:12:12.719]  I was told by another source, hey, don't worry, he's going after Bezos first, because of the Washington Post and how he's getting all this free tax money and everything, and Trump just thinks it's bad anyways.
[03:12:13.219 --> 03:12:15.761]  If Facebook was getting tax money, he'd do it too, but they're not.
[03:12:16.242 --> 03:12:17.783]  And now it's all here.
[03:12:18.284 --> 03:12:21.046]  I mean, wow, this is incredible.
[03:12:21.366 --> 03:12:25.490]  So what can you say about his gun move, going, OK, give us what you want?
[03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:26.791]  And they go, OK, we want to ban the guns.
[03:12:27.592 --> 03:12:34.438]  And people go, oh my God, I mean, I was told that Trump was in meetings and said, watch what I'm going to do and don't get on my ass when I do it.
[03:12:34.658 --> 03:12:46.007]  And you see him in that meeting with Feinstein a month ago, and the Republicans are kind of nodding and smiling because, and then I'm told, like, you can go ahead and even tell people because the left's so delusional they don't even listen to us.
[03:12:46.528 --> 03:12:48.850]  But I mean, I just, I'm not Machiavelli, Roger.
[03:12:48.890 --> 03:12:49.870]  You know, I'm like straight up.
[03:12:50.451 --> 03:12:51.131]  That's my strength.
[03:12:51.171 --> 03:12:52.312]  It's also my weakness.
[03:12:52.332 --> 03:12:53.734]  But geez, you know Trump well.
[03:12:54.034 --> 03:12:55.195]  Is that really what's going on here?
[03:12:56.323 --> 03:13:02.629]  What I think's going on is the media is getting some rhetoric, but the NRA is getting the legislation.
[03:13:02.689 --> 03:13:15.901]  Look, Donald Trump and the Republicans stand no chance whatsoever in the next two elections without the active support of the greatest grassroots political organization probably left in the country, the National Rifle Association.
[03:13:16.021 --> 03:13:18.844]  No, I agree, but is he really massively playing them?
[03:13:18.864 --> 03:13:21.887]  Because I was told he's playing them by Ted Nugent and a congressman.
[03:13:22.475 --> 03:13:24.116]  I think they're both absolutely right, Alex.
[03:13:24.176 --> 03:13:25.796]  I think the President is playing him.
[03:13:25.876 --> 03:13:27.997]  We can count on him on the Second Amendment.
[03:13:28.057 --> 03:13:31.598]  Look, I think this has to be seen within a larger context.
[03:13:32.058 --> 03:13:36.920]  Stormy Daniels getting no traction with the American people at all, despite it all.
[03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:38.140]  In fact, Trump's approval went up.
[03:13:40.021 --> 03:13:43.182]  And you can see why, among many men, that's entirely possible.
[03:13:44.022 --> 03:13:51.805]  At the same time, the real explanation is doubling, 100% increase in the GDP over Barack Obama.
[03:13:52.449 --> 03:13:59.701]  We had 3% GDP when Obama at best averaged 1.5%, and we were told that's what we could expect.
[03:14:00.333 --> 03:14:02.094]  So that's a hundred percent increase.
[03:14:02.114 --> 03:14:03.415]  And the American people feel it.
[03:14:03.815 --> 03:14:05.136]  They're beginning to feel it.
[03:14:05.276 --> 03:14:18.324]  Now, with the prospect of real peace and a settlement of this North Korean menace and a madman who we believe may have the capacity to destroy us, Trump is on the verge of true greatness.
[03:14:18.945 --> 03:14:29.231]  When he threatened a little dictator, you know, he was accused of being bellicose and it was dangerous, but it threatened them to the table.
[03:14:30.386 --> 03:14:31.847]  Skillful diplomacy.
[03:14:32.168 --> 03:14:33.649]  Trump does not want war.
[03:14:34.109 --> 03:14:37.932]  Now, the question most people have asked me, Alex, is what about this spending deal?
[03:14:37.952 --> 03:14:40.173]  Because let's face it, it stinks.
[03:14:41.134 --> 03:14:43.275]  There's so much in there that's just garbage.
[03:14:43.676 --> 03:14:45.617]  Chuck Schumer gets millions for a tunnel.
[03:14:45.957 --> 03:14:47.778]  We get nothing to build the wall.
[03:14:48.519 --> 03:14:49.940]  There's a lot of things wrong with it.
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:55.724]  But I think the president tells us in his own words, and it's both strategically important to understand.
[03:14:56.425 --> 03:15:07.254]  By giving the military build-up that not only Trump has promised, but which the generals want, he's buying the allegiance of our military in what could be a coming constitutional showdown.
[03:15:08.434 --> 03:15:23.126]  And for that reason, plus keeping his faith with and his support for rebuilding our muscle, he's delivered for the military, hopefully peeling them off from some of their intelligence neocon allies.
[03:15:23.766 --> 03:15:24.867]  Is this a chess move?
[03:15:25.027 --> 03:15:25.588]  I think so.
[03:15:26.871 --> 03:15:31.040]  He accepts all the crap that he doesn't like because he has now got the generals.
[03:15:31.481 --> 03:15:32.744]  We know he has the first
[03:15:33.490 --> 03:15:36.352]  Non-civilian Secretary of Defense in memory.
[03:15:36.992 --> 03:15:38.914]  I really think, Alex, that's what's going on.
[03:15:39.674 --> 03:15:40.435]  We'll talk about it.
[03:15:40.495 --> 03:15:42.376]  More calls straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[03:15:42.816 --> 03:15:50.061]  All I know is Trump's gotten a 5, 10, 15, 20 point boost, depending on the poll, once the Democrats said we're going to ban the guns.
[03:15:50.141 --> 03:15:52.503]  I mean, they did get shucked in.
[03:15:52.523 --> 03:15:58.507]  And I love watching Hogg and all the rest of them fall flat on their anti-gun little fascist faces.
[03:16:02.748 --> 03:16:03.609]  There is an issue.
[03:16:05.230 --> 03:16:06.130]  There is a movement.
[03:16:06.731 --> 03:16:07.952]  There is a phenomenon.
[03:16:08.972 --> 03:16:10.093]  Taking place right now.
[03:16:11.934 --> 03:16:15.677]  That is the number one issue on this planet.
[03:16:16.818 --> 03:16:19.760]  Not just for humanity, but for all life forms.
[03:16:21.829 --> 03:16:35.796]  Now I've been on air more than 23 years, but only now, studying how we're attacked by mainstream media, and by globalists, and by major governments, do I understand the whole continuum.
[03:16:36.496 --> 03:16:36.977]  The ballgame.
[03:16:38.778 --> 03:16:51.204]  So this is some of the most important information you're ever going to hear here, and it's up to you, if you care about yourself and your family, and if you're conscious, if you're not an animal, as the globalists think you are, if you're not dead inside, to listen to me.
[03:16:53.502 --> 03:17:07.385]  I noticed in the last decade the number one thing mainstream media will attack me for is when I talk about how the human species through fluoride and through atrazine and through thousands of other chemicals is being changed.
[03:17:07.445 --> 03:17:12.227]  Our IQs are being lowered, our sexuality is being confused, our fertility is being destroyed.
[03:17:12.247 --> 03:17:13.167]  And it's a fact.
[03:17:14.267 --> 03:17:21.549]  And I just noticed in the last few years with all the late night comedy shows and all the Comedy Central shows and the newspapers
[03:17:23.264 --> 03:17:37.997]  80% of the attacks, including two in the last 24 hours, are when I show people Berkeley and Harvard and Princeton and Yale and Cambridge and all these groups.
[03:17:39.076 --> 03:17:48.384]  Saying the manipulation of the genetics and the hormones, the sexuality of amphibians and fish and mammals and everything is out of control.
[03:17:49.145 --> 03:17:55.570]  Amphibians are collapsing, fish are collapsing, they are asexual or bisexual or they are deformed.
[03:17:57.091 --> 03:18:04.258]  The male frogs, just under a little bit of atrazine, go over to the male frogs, their olfactory's changed, try to have sex with them when they can't, they're dying.
[03:18:05.305 --> 03:18:13.368]  And we would cover that and they would attack it and say we said it when I was actually holding up mainline journals saying it's making the frogs quote gay.
[03:18:13.388 --> 03:18:16.590]  You know, using that term to get people to look at it.
[03:18:17.762 --> 03:18:29.906]  And then I look, just last 24 hours, David Hogg, the spokesperson for gun control, and shows with Stephen Colbert and Thomas Middleditch claiming that I'm attacking him for being a beta male.
[03:18:30.226 --> 03:18:35.788]  When they had a big magazine cover saying the triumph of the beta male, I was saying they're mainlining and pushing the beta male.
[03:18:36.108 --> 03:18:39.409]  I wasn't attacking Mr. Middleditch or Mike Judge, who's a good friend of mine.
[03:18:39.449 --> 03:18:41.030]  I think Silicon Valley's a really funny show.
[03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:48.817]  I was just saying the media is pushing all this and then misrepresenting what I've said because they don't want you looking at it.
[03:18:49.197 --> 03:18:51.339]  They don't want you researching it.
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:58.226]  Because the additives and the chemicals and the whole deal is in the UN UNESCO founding documents.
[03:18:59.547 --> 03:19:06.835]  In 1947, the same year we got the National Security Act, to carry out this eugenics transhumanist operation.
[03:19:07.235 --> 03:19:14.262]  For example, on Infowars, one of his most famous statements was saying that, Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[03:19:14.322 --> 03:19:15.903]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[03:19:16.064 --> 03:19:17.405]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[03:19:17.725 --> 03:19:21.829]  Alex Jones said, the globalists are teaching us to turn off our life force.
[03:19:22.650 --> 03:19:29.376]  It's a camouflage so the alpha males that are still left don't notice they're being taken control of and being enslaved.
[03:19:29.557 --> 03:19:29.857]  Yeah.
[03:19:30.598 --> 03:19:31.198]  Is this true?
[03:19:31.278 --> 03:19:32.359]  Is this true?
[03:19:32.419 --> 03:19:33.981]  Are you enslaving the alpha males?
[03:19:34.141 --> 03:19:36.043]  Because you know I consider myself a bit of an alpha male.
[03:19:36.223 --> 03:19:36.583]  Oh really?
[03:19:37.304 --> 03:19:39.846]  Do you want to debate it or just let them make a big joke out of it?
[03:19:40.146 --> 03:19:43.049]  Because they're scared of us having a discussion.
[03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:47.412]  And I didn't realize this was the heart of their operation until they attacked me so hard.
[03:19:47.833 --> 03:19:54.258]  Almost all their attacks every day are based on this because they want you to not look around you and see what's happening.
[03:19:54.819 --> 03:19:57.021]  What do you as viewers and listeners think we should do?
[03:20:06.167 --> 03:20:08.771]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:33.492]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[03:20:33.612 --> 03:20:39.919]  You know, I was saying I was going to give all the callers free t-shirts for holding over an hour and a half, but I was going to keep them on, so I'm sorry I didn't communicate.
[03:20:39.939 --> 03:20:42.622]  So we're going to open the phones back up, because Roger wants to take calls.
[03:20:43.063 --> 03:20:47.508]  For the callers that are already on, they can get back in, or new callers, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, and we're going to get to you coming up here.
[03:20:47.528 --> 03:20:48.229]  You know, Roseanne Barr,
[03:20:53.905 --> 03:20:55.046]  I'm a big John Goodman fan.
[03:20:55.466 --> 03:20:59.809]  I was not a big TV fan in my life, but I did watch that show 25, 30 years ago and it was on.
[03:21:00.249 --> 03:21:03.751]  But she's been on the show six, seven, eight years ago.
[03:21:03.851 --> 03:21:05.152]  She came on four or five times.
[03:21:05.172 --> 03:21:06.412]  She's a listener.
[03:21:06.432 --> 03:21:08.774]  You can even say Roseanne Barr kind of woke up from the show.
[03:21:08.794 --> 03:21:09.594]  She said that on air.
[03:21:10.215 --> 03:21:11.836]  And I haven't been in contact with her for years.
[03:21:11.956 --> 03:21:12.836]  We tweeted at her today.
[03:21:12.856 --> 03:21:13.877]  She said she wants to come on.
[03:21:14.297 --> 03:21:16.558]  So Ted Nugent's on tomorrow and a bunch of other explosive stuff.
[03:21:16.578 --> 03:21:16.879]  But who knows?
[03:21:17.199 --> 03:21:18.960]  Roseanne Barr looks like may be on tomorrow.
[03:21:19.520 --> 03:21:20.521]  But what's interesting is
[03:21:21.772 --> 03:21:25.423]  Top rated shows on ABC, CBS, NBC now about 6-7 million.
[03:21:25.884 --> 03:21:27.509]  Back in their heyday they had like 30 million.
[03:21:27.609 --> 03:21:29.013]  People are sick of the propaganda.
[03:21:30.017 --> 03:21:34.921]  They just premiered her show with double the ratings that ABC gets at other top shows.
[03:21:36.002 --> 03:21:37.724]  18 million in the main demo.
[03:21:38.364 --> 03:21:39.966]  Something like 30 million total.
[03:21:40.646 --> 03:21:41.967]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:21:42.308 --> 03:21:46.711]  And the show is just a little pro-Trump and shows both sides.
[03:21:46.771 --> 03:21:49.314]  Kind of an Archie Bunker deal where there's both sides.
[03:21:49.734 --> 03:21:54.178]  That's how hungry America is to just not be beat over the head.
[03:21:54.658 --> 03:21:56.480]  What does that say to you, Roger Stone?
[03:21:56.520 --> 03:21:57.521]  I know you know Roseanne as well.
[03:21:58.764 --> 03:22:01.389]  You know, she's a woman of enormous class and style.
[03:22:01.689 --> 03:22:05.436]  She's upgraded her look extraordinarily.
[03:22:05.496 --> 03:22:08.401]  She ended up on my best dressed list and she deserves it.
[03:22:09.068 --> 03:22:16.952]  She has to take the brickbats of liberal Hollywood for having an alternative view that is not politically correct.
[03:22:17.412 --> 03:22:25.656]  But because of her talent and because of her fame based on the great success of the show in its first run, she has some leverage.
[03:22:25.937 --> 03:22:29.398]  I had asked her to be on the Alex Jones Show last year.
[03:22:29.839 --> 03:22:31.359]  She was very kind.
[03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:38.703]  She is indeed a viewer and she is certainly a patriot and I think privately a supporter of the president.
[03:22:39.355 --> 03:22:41.136]  Uh, and she was most gracious.
[03:22:41.236 --> 03:22:46.720]  So I'm delighted to see the extraordinary success for a woman of great class.
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:47.941]  And I think, uh, sure.
[03:22:47.981 --> 03:22:54.646]  But I mean, she went on national television, uh, and then said last week she supported Trump.
[03:22:56.004 --> 03:22:58.887]  Yeah, no, I think, but she's not wearing on her sleeve.
[03:22:58.927 --> 03:23:00.388]  That's not the point of the show.
[03:23:00.428 --> 03:23:04.171]  No, no, sure, they bring it up and then she says, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, he's pro-America.
[03:23:04.191 --> 03:23:06.914]  I mean, yeah.
[03:23:06.994 --> 03:23:07.715]  It's refreshing.
[03:23:07.755 --> 03:23:10.998]  You don't see it out of anything created in Hollywood.
[03:23:11.058 --> 03:23:14.781]  She's only able to get away with it because she's a, deservedly, she's a star.
[03:23:14.861 --> 03:23:16.323]  I was about to say, she's really funny.
[03:23:16.343 --> 03:23:17.644]  The point is, is that
[03:23:19.747 --> 03:23:24.028]  Since when in America can't you support the Republican President, or you're a damn demon?
[03:23:24.828 --> 03:23:28.149]  You know, they've got all these videos saying Trump's a Nazi, you're a Nazi, I'm a Nazi.
[03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:35.850]  We put a video out paralleling youth marches and gun control and all this to Hitler, and the media is calling for us to be banned.
[03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:38.190]  How asinine is that?
[03:23:38.250 --> 03:23:44.111]  I mean, Sarah Silverman can dress up like Hitler and go on Colbert and say she supports Trump.
[03:23:44.612 --> 03:23:46.912]  But I've ordered a Hitler uniform.
[03:23:47.773 --> 03:23:59.342]  And I'm going to wear it, and I'm going to endorse Hillary, and I'm going to endorse David Hogg, and I'm going to endorse Michael Moore, and I'm going to endorse gun control, and I'm going to endorse the Democratic Party.
[03:23:59.642 --> 03:24:01.883]  I wonder what they're going to do when I do it, Roger.
[03:24:03.285 --> 03:24:05.546]  Oh, then it would be the worst thing of all time.
[03:24:05.586 --> 03:24:08.368]  Look, a double standard among our liberal friends?
[03:24:08.428 --> 03:24:10.770]  Oh my goodness, who's ever seen that?
[03:24:10.890 --> 03:24:11.711]  Look, the elitists!
[03:24:13.316 --> 03:24:19.183]  I don't think they take any of the movement seriously, and that's to their detriment.
[03:24:19.223 --> 03:24:21.366]  That's how President Trump got elected.
[03:24:21.927 --> 03:24:26.392]  But the elites, I think, are making an enormous mistake.
[03:24:26.973 --> 03:24:28.455]  This attack on guns
[03:24:29.102 --> 03:24:42.292]  Interestingly enough, is the one thing that allows Trump to transcend the Republican base... I was about to say, I was about to say, coming out and saying repeal the Second Amendment, former Supreme Court justices everywhere, and then Cuomo saying they never said it.
[03:24:43.052 --> 03:24:44.253]  What is their problem?
[03:24:44.353 --> 03:24:48.176]  I mean, this was the one thing that could wake up the sleeping giant.
[03:24:48.236 --> 03:24:49.297]  I mean, exactly.
[03:24:49.377 --> 03:24:50.158]  Why did they do that?
[03:24:51.124 --> 03:24:54.926]  Blue-collar Democrats who don't like Republicans but love this country.
[03:24:55.586 --> 03:25:03.809]  Union Democrats, working-class people, who normally aren't touched by the Republican country club set, are riled over this issue.
[03:25:04.169 --> 03:25:06.050]  They have awakened a sleeping giant.
[03:25:06.430 --> 03:25:11.332]  The NRA is the finest oil political machine in the country when it comes to elections.
[03:25:11.392 --> 03:25:18.255]  Republicans who are already conceding the House and running like the lily-livered cowards for the tall grass
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:21.082]  from this president are making an enormous mistake.
[03:25:21.543 --> 03:25:23.224]  We have doubled the GNP.
[03:25:23.244 --> 03:25:32.713]  I was about to say, why is the Republican establishment so cowardly, so addled, so stupid when victory is in our hands, they are running for the hills.
[03:25:33.649 --> 03:25:49.749]  Because they answer to the special interests, and the special interests who control Washington, the defense contractors, and the other grifters within the system, the whole swamp complex, are so threatened by the President that they aren't funded.
[03:25:50.714 --> 03:25:52.114]  They really are a bunch of cowards.
[03:25:52.154 --> 03:26:08.200]  We could have the whole world and build a better system and there's all these chicken craps that follow East Coast, not bashing East Coast people, but East Coast global foundations that really have a heart on for the country because they've always been trying to get control of the country since robber baron days.
[03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:09.180]  They don't get it.
[03:26:09.220 --> 03:26:10.181]  They just got out of the way.
[03:26:10.241 --> 03:26:11.281]  They'd get the whole planet.
[03:26:11.781 --> 03:26:12.702]  Move, bitch!
[03:26:12.982 --> 03:26:14.043]  Get out the way!
[03:26:14.304 --> 03:26:15.465]  Get out the way, bitch!
[03:26:15.665 --> 03:26:16.566]  You see them curtains?
[03:26:16.806 --> 03:26:18.387]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[03:26:18.427 --> 03:26:19.368]  You see those headlights?
[03:26:19.789 --> 03:26:21.050]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.650]  Tell me that!
[03:26:21.931 --> 03:26:23.392]  They don't get it, Roger.
[03:26:23.452 --> 03:26:24.313]  What is their problem?
[03:26:25.932 --> 03:26:29.013]  They are, too, in the thrall of the special interests.
[03:26:29.093 --> 03:26:31.893]  Although, I must say, I'm going to give the devil his due.
[03:26:31.993 --> 03:26:33.094]  Hero of the week.
[03:26:33.534 --> 03:26:42.056]  Senator Mitch McConnell, of all people, has a bill, which means it will become law, he's the leader, to legalize industrial hemp.
[03:26:42.716 --> 03:26:45.016]  This is an enormous step forward.
[03:26:45.096 --> 03:26:48.217]  No THC, way better than cotton, banned for 80 years.
[03:26:48.617 --> 03:26:50.278]  What is Sessions' problem?
[03:26:50.778 --> 03:26:51.998]  I hear he's got dementia.
[03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:54.410]  I hear the same thing.
[03:26:54.770 --> 03:26:58.111]  Congressman, I've spoken to, met with him privately for an hour or more.
[03:26:58.131 --> 03:26:59.672]  Describe him as addled.
[03:27:00.172 --> 03:27:02.093]  Describe him as delusional.
[03:27:02.433 --> 03:27:04.935]  Describe him as obsessed with marijuana.
[03:27:05.055 --> 03:27:05.755]  Obsessed with it.
[03:27:06.796 --> 03:27:13.519]  Obsessed with assets.
[03:27:13.799 --> 03:27:15.420]  That's Trump's biggest problem is Sessions.
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:20.002]  The question is why the president doesn't discharge Mr. Rosenstein and then
[03:27:20.482 --> 03:27:30.136]  Discharge of Mr. Sessions, which would be the correct order to ensure that he get an honest and non-politicized Justice Department.
[03:27:30.936 --> 03:27:38.260]  You know, I know I said I want to hear about Russiagate, but man, we got Mattis saying, yeah, we blow a bunch of Russians up, we'll blow more up in Syria, and they better watch it.
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:39.360]  We're going to get really tough.
[03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:41.881]  I mean, it is like foaming at the mouth.
[03:27:42.222 --> 03:27:50.085]  Meanwhile, it's in the news, the Communist Chinese have the codes to all the telecoms and the big national database that controls all the phone numbers and our satellites.
[03:27:50.646 --> 03:27:53.227]  And I'm just like, how did we ever get in this position?
[03:27:54.946 --> 03:28:09.370]  No, look, the Trump administration has moved ahead on offensive weapons for the Ukrainian forces that the Russians vehemently object to in the diplomatic process and are very angry about.
[03:28:09.770 --> 03:28:14.571]  So much for the idea that Donald Trump is in the pocket of Vladimir Putin.
[03:28:15.271 --> 03:28:17.232]  We've just dispelled these athletes.
[03:28:17.412 --> 03:28:21.253]  I really think, in many cases, this Russophobia
[03:28:22.003 --> 03:28:32.458]  Rhetoric coming from Mattis is meant to kind of bolster that narrative for the American people as kind of almost of a political head fake.
[03:28:32.898 --> 03:28:34.541]  Trump is not soft on the Russians.
[03:28:34.581 --> 03:28:37.505]  He knows exactly who they are and what they are.
[03:28:39.232 --> 03:28:43.716]  When we come back, Julian Assange is now on house arrest at the Paraguayan Embassy.
[03:28:43.996 --> 03:28:45.077]  They've cut his internet off.
[03:28:45.417 --> 03:28:48.160]  They've got members of the Tory thing calling him a worm and stuff.
[03:28:48.500 --> 03:28:51.422]  Are they about to move against one of the greatest living heroes out there?
[03:28:51.783 --> 03:28:56.427]  Because with me, they just try to take my kids and bankrupt me and everything else, but I'm not locked up the tower.
[03:28:57.087 --> 03:28:59.029]  The Tower of London, like Julian Assange.
[03:29:02.432 --> 03:29:04.313]  Pike and Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:29:04.353 --> 03:29:04.654]  Go ahead.
[03:29:05.559 --> 03:29:07.461]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:29:07.501 --> 03:29:16.909]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:29:18.010 --> 03:29:21.373]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:29:21.793 --> 03:29:22.093]  Absolutely.
[03:29:44.605 --> 03:29:57.502]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:30:07.455 --> 03:30:15.361]  On screen you see a Fox News camera inside the World Economic Forum as President Trump meets with world business leaders.
[03:30:15.961 --> 03:30:29.330]  And we've got the HD footage if you're a TV viewer that Dan Lyman shot earlier today as President Trump with three Marine One helicopters, Blackhawks, arrived there in Davos to put in another 18-hour workday.
[03:30:29.390 --> 03:30:34.794]  Works about 15 hours a day when he's regularly back in the U.S., 18 hours a day according to sources.
[03:30:35.094 --> 03:30:40.175]  Dan Lyman, Infowars.com reporter, is on the ground in Davos.
[03:30:40.195 --> 03:30:44.316]  We haven't talked to him for 24 hours, so a lot has transcribed.
[03:30:44.336 --> 03:30:51.417]  You can follow his amazing tweets and information, not just retweeted at RealAlexJones, but also on his Twitter account.
[03:30:51.437 --> 03:30:53.358]  All right, Dan Lyman, wow, a lot's happened.
[03:30:53.638 --> 03:30:56.358]  We'll be rolling this HD footage in the background while you give us a briefing.
[03:30:56.598 --> 03:30:59.939]  Where do you want to start on day one of Davos as President Trump arrives?
[03:31:00.359 --> 03:31:02.640]  It was definitely an interesting day with Trump's arrival.
[03:31:02.840 --> 03:31:13.744]  The helipad was a lot more crowded than it has been on the other days, which is kind of a slap in the face to the other leaders that have been showing up in the past days that people, I guess, weren't as interested in.
[03:31:13.884 --> 03:31:16.906]  It was very crowded out there, but it was great to see him come in.
[03:31:16.946 --> 03:31:17.846]  It was magnificent.
[03:31:18.866 --> 03:31:23.429]  I would say that even the people who don't like him are still fascinated by the prospect that he's in town.
[03:31:23.469 --> 03:31:25.571]  There's a kind of an aura that he brings with him.
[03:31:25.691 --> 03:31:30.113]  There is definitely an awakening and it's happening even at the highest levels, even within Davos.
[03:31:30.133 --> 03:31:33.315]  You have the defectors here and there.
[03:31:33.776 --> 03:31:37.418]  And this video that you're airing right now, I watched that earlier today.
[03:31:37.738 --> 03:31:40.500]  The awe that Trump puts everyone in, he silenced the room.
[03:31:40.600 --> 03:31:43.722]  Someone called it that he had turned Davos into Versailles.
[03:31:44.102 --> 03:31:47.545]  And it was an incredible reception that he received there.
[03:31:47.805 --> 03:31:51.308]  And I think they all know they're in the presence of a lion, a true alpha male.
[03:31:51.368 --> 03:31:54.711]  The caption had something to the effect of, this is true power.
[03:31:55.151 --> 03:31:58.234]  Trump silences a room full of media journalists and globalists.
[03:31:58.674 --> 03:31:59.955]  And it's true.
[03:31:59.995 --> 03:32:01.837]  I mean, these people, they don't shut up.
[03:32:01.917 --> 03:32:03.338]  I hear them talking constantly.
[03:32:03.378 --> 03:32:04.439]  They're always on the phone.
[03:32:04.479 --> 03:32:05.400]  They're talking to each other.
[03:32:05.760 --> 03:32:09.263]  And then when you see Trump coming in the room, it's just like every cell phone is out.
[03:32:09.383 --> 03:32:10.184]  Everyone's in awe.
[03:32:10.544 --> 03:32:25.688]  Trump brings that Trump aura, which translates so great to just the American aura, the power, confidence through strength, and peace as well, and he just brought that into the room, and you could see that in that video and his entrance in general.
[03:32:25.748 --> 03:32:34.410]  The man they said that couldn't beat the establishment, he couldn't beat the globalists, they were all against him, and now they worship the ground that he walks on whether they want to admit it or not.
[03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:35.811]  That happened yesterday.
[03:32:36.412 --> 03:32:38.454]  Suddenly, the heads of Davos said, we love Trump.
[03:32:38.554 --> 03:32:39.495]  I had the headline here.
[03:32:39.515 --> 03:32:40.656]  It was like, we love him.
[03:32:40.716 --> 03:32:41.697]  It's been a great year.
[03:32:41.757 --> 03:32:43.219]  Actually, the world economy's better.
[03:32:43.279 --> 03:32:44.080]  Thank God for Trump.
[03:32:44.420 --> 03:32:46.402]  And it's like suddenly they've all been attacking him.
[03:32:46.703 --> 03:32:48.224]  And then now they all start saying, we love Trump.
[03:32:48.244 --> 03:32:48.785]  We love Trump.
[03:32:48.865 --> 03:32:53.930]  I mean, this just shows how Rockefellers and people were able to bully all these guys into line.
[03:32:54.211 --> 03:32:55.312]  Trump's not even bullying it.
[03:32:55.352 --> 03:32:56.253]  He's just leading.
[03:33:06.056 --> 03:33:10.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.619 --> 03:33:24.700]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:33:25.260 --> 03:33:27.521]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.623 --> 03:33:32.065]  Ain't no mountain high.
[03:33:32.566 --> 03:33:34.008]  Ain't no valley low.
[03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:37.474]  Ain't no river wide enough, baby.
[03:33:37.494 --> 03:33:39.677]  If you need me, call me.
[03:33:39.757 --> 03:33:40.198]  Crank it up.
[03:33:46.024 --> 03:33:56.535]  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being there in a hurry with Bezos 40 billion down today and clobbering all the rest of the globalists.
[03:33:56.555 --> 03:33:58.577]  I want to get the phone calls to Roger Stone here.
[03:33:58.597 --> 03:34:02.801]  He wants to take your calls, Chris and Newman, and a lot of big breaking news here.
[03:34:04.622 --> 03:34:07.764]  Bezos runs the Washington Post, even worse than the New York Times.
[03:34:07.784 --> 03:34:08.945]  Incredibly deceptive.
[03:34:09.586 --> 03:34:10.687]  He's involved with the leftists.
[03:34:10.727 --> 03:34:12.028]  He's trying to overthrow the country.
[03:34:12.508 --> 03:34:14.169]  He's tax-exempt.
[03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:15.610]  He gets $1.48 on every package.
[03:34:16.151 --> 03:34:17.292]  He's so arrogant.
[03:34:18.813 --> 03:34:20.234]  And now Trump's going after him.
[03:34:20.274 --> 03:34:26.819]  But Axios, the folks over at Politico with their new name to confuse people,
[03:34:28.479 --> 03:34:28.679]  I think?
[03:34:47.419 --> 03:34:49.301]  Amazon is an anti-American company.
[03:34:49.862 --> 03:34:50.742]  Facebook is.
[03:34:51.143 --> 03:34:56.187]  They thought they'd go after this, you know, Analytica company, but then that only exposed Facebook's overall business.
[03:34:56.567 --> 03:34:58.569]  So what is the word on this?
[03:34:59.190 --> 03:35:00.891]  And, I mean, how big this is?
[03:35:00.971 --> 03:35:01.972]  Because this is incredible.
[03:35:03.033 --> 03:35:10.440]  How incredible, Alex, that both Bezos and Zuckerberg are in retreat in major, major scandals, in essence.
[03:35:11.409 --> 03:35:11.709]  I think
[03:35:25.632 --> 03:35:38.218]  Tech left strategy of shutting down not only his voice, but firstly our voice, which of course is a magnifier, a megaphone as it were, for him.
[03:35:38.238 --> 03:35:42.841]  I mean, they turned down our volume as the only way they can stop this president.
[03:35:42.981 --> 03:35:47.343]  A free, vibrant, open internet is what allowed the election of Donald Trump.
[03:35:47.723 --> 03:35:53.205]  It will allow a fair 2018 election and would be key to a Trump re-election.
[03:35:53.245 --> 03:36:01.669]  Without it, ABC, NBC, CNN, and the other of the motley crew of mainstream media twister, The Washington Post,
[03:36:02.426 --> 03:36:03.086]  Being the worst.
[03:36:03.226 --> 03:36:08.249]  This very week, this past week, they fabricated a story about me.
[03:36:09.189 --> 03:36:25.076]  Now, as it turns out, based totally on hearsay, two people tell the Post, they told the Special Prosecutor Stone, told us he visited Assange, and one of them said, I told him that I knew about the contents of the WikiLeaks disclosures in advance.
[03:36:25.583 --> 03:36:27.966]  All fabricated for a fake news cycle.
[03:36:28.026 --> 03:36:29.127]  So, I'm with you.
[03:36:29.167 --> 03:36:31.430]  The Washington Post is the worst of the worst.
[03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:36.355]  Bezos is a fish-faced enemy of this administration.
[03:36:36.416 --> 03:36:38.238]  And Trump is taking off the gloves, Alex.
[03:36:40.060 --> 03:36:58.734]  There's an excellent article on the Daily Caller that deals with how Google and the other tech companies are openly in league with the Democrats, and the way they tried to spin it that a mercenary company in the UK that a bunch of people hired did some work for Bannon, so, oh, they invented data mining, and this is how Trump stole it.
[03:36:59.114 --> 03:37:03.638]  And then that just, like a sweater, the string, pulled the whole thing open that
[03:37:04.398 --> 03:37:06.882]  Facebook's this giant data mining company.
[03:37:06.902 --> 03:37:07.924]  They're just idiots.
[03:37:07.984 --> 03:37:10.308]  They don't realize what they're doing.
[03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:15.797]  No, I think that Cambridge Analytica stories have some validity.
[03:37:17.253 --> 03:37:20.156]  Guys are initially financed by the Mercers.
[03:37:20.236 --> 03:37:29.244]  They claim to have the new mousetrap when it comes to finite political targeting of disgruntled and therefore movable voters.
[03:37:30.305 --> 03:37:33.328]  They really, I think, don't have the sizzle.
[03:37:33.368 --> 03:37:37.752]  They have a lot of sizzle, but their product is found wanting in the Ted Cruz campaign.
[03:37:38.243 --> 03:37:43.008]  I think they come to the verge of litigation there.
[03:37:44.270 --> 03:37:52.419]  I was rather shocked to hear that in the end they got a $6 million contract, but now as we turned out to learn, it was to mine data
[03:37:54.160 --> 03:38:04.087]  Uh, through the back door of Facebook and turn it over to Brad Parscale and the, uh, digital Trump team who, and we don't know how or if they used it.
[03:38:04.287 --> 03:38:06.869]  Uh, they said, this is a continuing mystery.
[03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:08.530]  It's a total red, red herring canard.
[03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.930]  It's not even 1.1%.
[03:38:10.311 --> 03:38:11.592]  Of the stuff going on, just like Russia.
[03:38:11.632 --> 03:38:11.972]  Here it is.
[03:38:12.352 --> 03:38:12.732]  Report.
[03:38:12.772 --> 03:38:15.713]  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will testify to Congress.
[03:38:16.054 --> 03:38:17.374]  Here's the article that's excellent.
[03:38:17.694 --> 03:38:21.536]  How the left turned tech giants into their speech police, which is all admitted.
[03:38:21.556 --> 03:38:23.417]  They have all the statements, the videos.
[03:38:23.437 --> 03:38:28.559]  You know, Prager University sued over how they put age restriction on something that shouldn't be.
[03:38:28.579 --> 03:38:30.320]  Well, that's their prerogative.
[03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:34.121]  But when you have videos by Veritas saying our enemy's Alex Jones.
[03:38:34.201 --> 03:38:34.782]  Ban him.
[03:38:35.302 --> 03:38:35.962]  F-rednecks.
[03:38:36.222 --> 03:38:37.103]  F-American flags.
[03:38:37.263 --> 03:38:37.763]  F-veterans.
[03:38:38.303 --> 03:38:44.384]  The judges will let that go forward, because the tortious interference, the racketeering, the lawyers have all looked at it.
[03:38:44.404 --> 03:38:45.845]  That's why we keep building our cases.
[03:38:45.885 --> 03:38:46.665]  They're so strong.
[03:38:47.165 --> 03:38:56.807]  It just keeps getting added, and the selective enforcement, and banning our videos, saying we said David Hogg is a crisis actor, and no one died, and our video doesn't say that.
[03:38:57.327 --> 03:39:00.808]  That's the real case, and I just want Google to back off, but like you said,
[03:39:02.113 --> 03:39:08.977]  He starts bad-mouthing Google for its CIA connections and its NASA satellites and all of its interspatial stuff.
[03:39:09.517 --> 03:39:16.721]  And I mean, what I don't get about Obama and Hillary and Bezos and Zuckerberg is they're so arrogant.
[03:39:17.261 --> 03:39:20.163]  Don't they know Trump has them by the huevos?
[03:39:20.263 --> 03:39:27.947]  I mean, seriously, the way the Global has transferred all the power to the executive, I'm surprised Trump hasn't moved stronger already.
[03:39:27.967 --> 03:39:29.328]  This has got to be freaking them out.
[03:39:30.794 --> 03:39:36.695]  Well, but Alex, let's remember, the folks at Google are dining with the President's son-in-law and his daughter.
[03:39:37.595 --> 03:39:49.178]  And they're professional swamp creatures with the right lobbyists, and perhaps they think they can neutralize this administration through obfuscation of what they've really be done.
[03:39:49.218 --> 03:39:49.678]  Exactly!
[03:39:49.738 --> 03:39:55.359]  Just because they're a clear and present danger and sold out the Chinese like Apple, they're fair game, man.
[03:39:55.419 --> 03:39:56.719]  They need to be wiped out.
[03:39:57.319 --> 03:39:59.560]  And by that, wiped out from their monopoly.
[03:40:00.542 --> 03:40:11.330]  How could you not understand, Alex, the financial, lucrative nature of storing all of our foremost secrets and all of our defense knowledge over in China and making a quick buck?
[03:40:11.690 --> 03:40:13.511]  How could you not understand what it's like to do that?
[03:40:13.531 --> 03:40:16.673]  Well, you know, as a Russian agent, I'm mad Apple's moving and giving them the keys.
[03:40:16.694 --> 03:40:22.458]  And as you said, Chinese telecoms under Obama were giving the index keys to the entire grid to control it and be able to bring it down.
[03:40:22.518 --> 03:40:22.898]  Exactly!
[03:40:23.078 --> 03:40:26.901]  We're such damn Russian agents, we're pissed we just handed the keys over to the GICOMS!
[03:40:28.277 --> 03:40:33.339]  It's really extraordinary as you try to follow these things.
[03:40:34.239 --> 03:40:43.002]  Zuckerberg having his time in the barrel about these disclosures at the same time Bezos is under attack shows me the president knows
[03:40:44.502 --> 03:40:45.943]  You know, who his friends are.
[03:40:46.263 --> 03:40:48.843]  And by the way, we know the Pledge Protection Team and stuff.
[03:40:49.183 --> 03:40:51.404]  It's not just... I didn't tell you guys, I apologize.
[03:40:51.424 --> 03:40:53.124]  Can you get... How could it be Sanders?
[03:40:53.444 --> 03:40:54.664]  Should have pressed Congress there about it.
[03:40:55.185 --> 03:40:57.705]  Them coming out and pointing out, hey, you're all taxpayer funded.
[03:40:57.725 --> 03:40:58.525]  Hey, you're a scam.
[03:40:58.925 --> 03:40:59.966]  Hey, you rip people off.
[03:41:00.046 --> 03:41:02.726]  I mean, that's just the beginning of what Trump can do.
[03:41:02.786 --> 03:41:04.527]  We can actually pull that money from him.
[03:41:04.907 --> 03:41:09.408]  But Bezos just stumbles around with one eye looking over here and the other one over there.
[03:41:09.428 --> 03:41:10.508]  I mean, he just doesn't get it, man.
[03:41:12.583 --> 03:41:15.409]  I must tell you, he owns Whole Foods.
[03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:21.000]  They go head-to-head with us in the nutraceutical industry.
[03:41:21.140 --> 03:41:22.283]  I've used their products.
[03:41:22.842 --> 03:41:24.403]  I've used the InfoWars products.
[03:41:24.863 --> 03:41:26.103]  I've paid both prices.
[03:41:27.084 --> 03:41:42.489]  The products at InfoWars are both less expensive and they're of higher quality and in my case with greater results than the overpriced stuff I bought at Whole Foods where I think I was buying a filler in some case or other.
[03:41:42.509 --> 03:41:43.829]  But let's expand on that.
[03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:47.531]  It's that Bezos has the Washington Post call a snaggle salesman.
[03:41:48.211 --> 03:41:50.272]  For selling some of the same supplements they sell.
[03:41:50.312 --> 03:41:51.833]  He's just a jerk, man.
[03:41:51.853 --> 03:41:54.895]  I don't run around trying to shut down other companies.
[03:41:55.296 --> 03:42:00.819]  I'm just, like, what's this thing about these Ivy League guys that, like, they just want to F everybody over.
[03:42:01.660 --> 03:42:02.280]  They're jerks!
[03:42:03.661 --> 03:42:05.742]  Well, but in this case, correction.
[03:42:05.822 --> 03:42:13.367]  What he really offends him is that we are in the same business and our products are superior to his at a better price.
[03:42:13.775 --> 03:42:24.466]  So he resents our competition, he puts us down as hucksters for selling vitamins and other all-natural nutraceuticals, when he himself is doing the same thing.
[03:42:24.866 --> 03:42:31.453]  It's the classic liberal elitist, do not as I said, do as I said.
[03:42:31.473 --> 03:42:34.115]  And I agree, we're going to come back and take calls, but do you notice how
[03:42:35.632 --> 03:42:39.256]  They call Trump Hitler, you Hitler, me Hitler, all this crap.
[03:42:39.536 --> 03:42:42.279]  We point out youth marches, call them for banning free speech and guns.
[03:42:42.559 --> 03:42:43.280]  It's pretty Hitler.
[03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:45.602]  Then they call for us to be banned, which is even more Hitler.
[03:42:46.423 --> 03:42:47.724]  I mean, that's it.
[03:42:47.745 --> 03:42:50.988]  I mean, you guys really are like Hitler.
[03:42:51.809 --> 03:42:52.710]  You're all race-based.
[03:42:52.730 --> 03:42:53.050]  We're not.
[03:42:53.090 --> 03:42:53.791]  We're free market.
[03:42:53.811 --> 03:42:54.612]  We're idea-based.
[03:42:55.072 --> 03:42:55.653]  You jerks.
[03:42:56.053 --> 03:42:57.154]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[03:42:57.234 --> 03:42:58.596]  Newman, Chris and others, stay with us.
[03:43:04.608 --> 03:43:22.917]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:23.018 --> 03:43:28.420]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:29.301 --> 03:43:29.961]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:30.081 --> 03:43:33.243]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.883 --> 03:43:34.884]  And so much more.
[03:43:35.424 --> 03:43:36.565]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.786 --> 03:43:38.507]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:38.527 --> 03:43:44.212]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:44.332 --> 03:43:45.533]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:45.553 --> 03:43:47.474]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:47.554 --> 03:43:49.936]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:50.156 --> 03:43:51.397]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:51.578 --> 03:43:53.399]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.959 --> 03:43:54.560]  Immune Wall.
[03:43:54.660 --> 03:43:57.282]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:03.067 --> 03:44:05.129]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:44:05.369 --> 03:44:06.710]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:10.473]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:44:10.833 --> 03:44:18.579]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:44:18.780 --> 03:44:23.603]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:44:23.764 --> 03:44:29.228]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:44:29.548 --> 03:44:37.072]  Secret 12 by Infowars Live is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:44:37.332 --> 03:44:41.774]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:44:42.054 --> 03:44:50.898]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:44:51.078 --> 03:44:54.320]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[03:44:54.620 --> 03:44:58.322]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at Infowarslife.com.
[03:44:58.522 --> 03:45:00.602]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:02.343 --> 03:45:11.167]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immunewall.
[03:45:12.423 --> 03:45:14.205]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:45:14.265 --> 03:45:21.393]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:45:21.793 --> 03:45:27.599]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:29.601]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:45:30.202 --> 03:45:49.256]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:45:50.337 --> 03:45:54.459]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[03:45:54.779 --> 03:45:57.320]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[03:45:57.380 --> 03:46:00.081]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[03:46:00.461 --> 03:46:01.521]  As above so below.
[03:46:02.062 --> 03:46:04.903]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[03:46:05.783 --> 03:46:06.884]  Most tiny of scales.
[03:46:07.385 --> 03:46:08.506]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:46:08.906 --> 03:46:10.387]  America is building its wall.
[03:46:10.788 --> 03:46:11.268]  Will it work?
[03:46:11.388 --> 03:46:11.889]  We don't know.
[03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.970]  Is Trump right?
[03:46:13.671 --> 03:46:15.793]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[03:46:16.293 --> 03:46:19.876]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work.
[03:46:20.297 --> 03:46:22.259]  And without this wall, we would all die.
[03:46:22.619 --> 03:46:27.283]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family.
[03:46:27.303 --> 03:46:28.525]  And I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[03:46:29.245 --> 03:46:35.552]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[03:46:36.313 --> 03:46:51.328]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[03:46:51.969 --> 03:46:54.350]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[03:46:54.990 --> 03:46:58.230]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:58.570 --> 03:47:02.291]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[03:47:05.532 --> 03:47:11.753]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.354 --> 03:47:20.075]  Regrets I've had a few
[03:47:22.085 --> 03:47:26.986]  But then again, too few to mention.
[03:47:29.086 --> 03:47:32.807]  I did what I had to do.
[03:47:33.307 --> 03:47:39.689]  Saw it through without exemption.
[03:47:41.649 --> 03:47:45.610]  I planned each charted course.
[03:47:47.010 --> 03:47:51.951]  Each careful step along the byway.
[03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:57.851]  That's what America's about!
[03:48:07.205 --> 03:48:08.946]  The great Frank Sinatra bringing us in.
[03:48:09.547 --> 03:48:12.388]  You know, people don't like Frank Sinatra or they don't like Johnny Cash.
[03:48:12.408 --> 03:48:13.249]  There's something wrong with them.
[03:48:13.889 --> 03:48:18.012]  I know this one guy in media who didn't like them both and I knew that guy had a problem and he did.
[03:48:19.013 --> 03:48:20.153]  Look, I'm a bad person.
[03:48:20.193 --> 03:48:26.477]  We got like 10 minutes left here and I got like 10 calls and I want to get to Newman and Chris and James and Allen and Honeypot and Ryan.
[03:48:26.497 --> 03:48:27.258]  They've all got great points.
[03:48:27.298 --> 03:48:27.898]  Roger Stone's here.
[03:48:27.918 --> 03:48:28.839]  He'll be back during the war room.
[03:48:29.159 --> 03:48:30.340]  Lord Owen Troyer coming up.
[03:48:31.698 --> 03:48:33.639]  But I don't take for granted this First Amendment we've got.
[03:48:33.659 --> 03:48:35.340]  And I don't take for granted the fact that you fund us.
[03:48:35.801 --> 03:48:37.902]  Brain Forge is 50% off our best-selling product.
[03:48:38.302 --> 03:48:39.543]  The Real Red Pill, 50% off.
[03:48:39.683 --> 03:48:40.384]  Both individually.
[03:48:40.664 --> 03:48:42.325]  You can get them together with free shipping.
[03:48:42.425 --> 03:48:47.028]  On top of it, when you buy them together, the Mind & Body Challenge Pack at Infolwerestore.com.
[03:48:47.228 --> 03:48:48.549]  I'm gonna leave it right there to go to your phone calls.
[03:48:48.809 --> 03:48:51.711]  But thank you all for helping us all be free.
[03:48:51.952 --> 03:48:53.332]  God bless you, listeners and viewers.
[03:48:53.593 --> 03:48:55.534]  You are the blood of the resistance.
[03:48:55.954 --> 03:48:56.495]  You are the heart.
[03:48:56.615 --> 03:48:57.435]  You are the guts.
[03:48:57.695 --> 03:48:58.376]  You are the mind.
[03:48:58.416 --> 03:49:01.338]  You are the bones that send you the flesh, the will, the spirit.
[03:49:01.958 --> 03:49:03.979]  You are 1776 reborn.
[03:49:04.399 --> 03:49:05.360]  It's true, look at the world.
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:06.420]  Haha!
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:08.181]  All over the planet, it's exploding.
[03:49:08.401 --> 03:49:08.881]  Haha!
[03:49:09.061 --> 03:49:11.142]  It's not talk, it's not bragging, it's the real thing.
[03:49:11.462 --> 03:49:13.223]  Cause somebody wasn't a sociopath.
[03:49:13.623 --> 03:49:19.325]  Somebody wasn't like a skilled psycho, like trying to scam people and I'll be in control and all.
[03:49:19.505 --> 03:49:21.246]  How about just turn us loose, bitch!
[03:49:22.207 --> 03:49:23.087]  That's what it's all about.
[03:49:23.927 --> 03:49:24.728]  Get out of the way!
[03:49:25.488 --> 03:49:26.248]  Well, it's happening.
[03:49:26.688 --> 03:49:28.929]  Newman in Virginia, you're on the air with Roger Stone.
[03:49:29.270 --> 03:49:30.050]  Go ahead, welcome.
[03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:36.332]  Alex Emmert Jones, this is Daniel Frank Newman from Virginia.
[03:49:36.492 --> 03:49:37.113]  Welcome, brother.
[03:49:37.293 --> 03:49:37.934]  And I need your help.
[03:49:38.614 --> 03:49:39.355]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:49:39.375 --> 03:49:40.075]  I need your help, Alex.
[03:49:41.036 --> 03:49:41.576]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:49:44.179 --> 03:49:47.521]  We can win the Second Amendment argument today, but I need your help.
[03:49:48.202 --> 03:49:49.022]  Alright, tell me how to do it.
[03:49:50.524 --> 03:49:58.950]  You need to tell people, if they want to take our guns, they must want another 9-11 to happen, because that's what Dick Cheney did.
[03:49:59.411 --> 03:50:01.532]  He took the guns from the pilots on 9-11.
[03:50:04.073 --> 03:50:04.454]  That's right.
[03:50:04.494 --> 03:50:05.795]  You trust a pilot to fly a plane.
[03:50:05.815 --> 03:50:07.257]  Before that, a lot of pilots carried guns.
[03:50:07.278 --> 03:50:08.499]  I didn't even know that until it happened.
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:09.981]  They took them away two months before.
[03:50:10.001 --> 03:50:10.762]  That's a great point.
[03:50:13.406 --> 03:50:14.167]  That's a huge point.
[03:50:17.632 --> 03:50:18.854]  Nah, I'm listening, Newman.
[03:50:20.151 --> 03:50:24.934]  Well, I'm just saying, if I can get you to say it, like Mao and Stalin and Hitler... No!
[03:50:25.094 --> 03:50:26.114]  Hitler took the guns!
[03:50:26.214 --> 03:50:27.295]  Stalin took the guns!
[03:50:27.655 --> 03:50:30.276]  Dick Cheney and George W. Bush took the guns from the pilot!
[03:50:30.557 --> 03:50:34.719]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again!
[03:50:34.739 --> 03:50:36.660]  We will not relinquish our firearms!
[03:50:36.860 --> 03:50:39.361]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you got out there on the street!
[03:50:39.661 --> 03:50:41.002]  We will not back down!
[03:50:41.222 --> 03:50:43.463]  This is your direct ultimatum!
[03:50:43.644 --> 03:50:45.985]  Now, feel your hand, you son of a bitch!
[03:50:49.298 --> 03:50:51.259]  That's what you were looking for?
[03:50:51.279 --> 03:50:53.501]  Roger, come on in here.
[03:50:53.841 --> 03:50:56.563]  Alex, first of all, Alex, stop mincing words.
[03:50:57.104 --> 03:50:59.105]  Tell us how you really feel.
[03:50:59.285 --> 03:51:12.575]  Look, the most incredible thing I've seen, Alex, in gotta be 40 years in American politics, is a Supreme Court Justice, John Paul Stevens, openly saying, let's repeal the entire Second Amendment.
[03:51:12.635 --> 03:51:14.296]  And a bunch of other dumb sons of bitches.
[03:51:14.356 --> 03:51:15.037]  Why did they do that?
[03:51:15.097 --> 03:51:16.258]  It was a major miscalculation.
[03:51:16.878 --> 03:51:20.201]  Well, many Americans are saying, who is this guy?
[03:51:20.241 --> 03:51:21.241]  Let me tell you who he is.
[03:51:21.742 --> 03:51:30.388]  He is the only Supreme Court appointment of Gerald Ford, the accidental president who followed Nixon.
[03:51:30.869 --> 03:51:43.258]  Ford was a deeply flawed guardian because, of course, he had, at the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, altered the autopsy records of JFK to move the location.
[03:51:43.298 --> 03:51:45.200]  Yeah, we know he covered up the Warren Commission.
[03:51:46.100 --> 03:51:47.961]  And the New York Times reported all of this.
[03:51:47.981 --> 03:51:50.502]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[03:51:50.542 --> 03:51:51.362]  This is fact.
[03:51:51.762 --> 03:51:57.845]  So he was, and Nixon knew this, so Nixon was able to wheedle a pardon out of him.
[03:51:58.645 --> 03:52:01.406]  But this is the man who gave us John Paul Stevens.
[03:52:01.766 --> 03:52:03.887]  He is a liberal Republican.
[03:52:04.747 --> 03:52:07.068]  He was a... No, I know, but other ones are saying it.
[03:52:07.128 --> 03:52:09.209]  How dumb are they admitting their real plan?
[03:52:09.509 --> 03:52:11.250]  I mean, this may have killed the blue wave.
[03:52:12.179 --> 03:52:13.100]  Well, but think about this.
[03:52:13.140 --> 03:52:22.027]  He's a Supreme Court Justice appointed to the court by a Republican who immediately joins the liberal bloc that wants to take away our guns and our voice.
[03:52:22.527 --> 03:52:23.828]  It is outrageous.
[03:52:24.048 --> 03:52:27.331]  And now this Crip Keeper climbs up from hell to get our guns.
[03:52:27.391 --> 03:52:28.131]  Good luck, buddy.
[03:52:28.151 --> 03:52:30.673]  Because George Washington just had bowling balls here.
[03:52:30.693 --> 03:52:31.254]  You know what?
[03:52:31.654 --> 03:52:32.295]  Thank you, Newman.
[03:52:32.315 --> 03:52:32.855]  Great points.
[03:52:32.915 --> 03:52:35.977]  Chris, in the great state of Texas, you're on the air with Roger Stone.
[03:52:36.017 --> 03:52:36.358]  Go ahead.
[03:52:38.721 --> 03:52:39.441]  Yes, sir.
[03:52:39.461 --> 03:52:40.942]  This is Chris Lowry from Texas.
[03:52:41.002 --> 03:52:45.063]  I just wanted to inform you of the arrest again of C.J.
[03:52:45.103 --> 03:52:48.524]  Grisham, a fellow patriot and a true info warrior.
[03:52:49.225 --> 03:52:56.367]  Him and two other people were arrested yesterday, last night, in the city of Olmos Park, Texas.
[03:52:56.427 --> 03:52:59.908]  They were doing a demonstration, an open carry demonstration.
[03:53:00.589 --> 03:53:04.330]  The day before, he was on the phone with the chief and
[03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:17.499]  The team pretty much threatened him, but also at the very end of the call he was like, no, if you open carry, we will not draw on you, we will not harass you, but that was a big lie.
[03:53:18.239 --> 03:53:19.360]  He was tased in the back.
[03:53:19.380 --> 03:53:20.981]  Well, we'll get Mr. Gresham back on.
[03:53:21.041 --> 03:53:28.426]  He's a great, highly decorated patriot of three wars, and he goes out in the countryside and marches down the road with his AR-15 and they arrest him.
[03:53:28.446 --> 03:53:29.367]  We just showed video of that.
[03:53:30.027 --> 03:53:31.048]  That was like four years ago.
[03:53:31.088 --> 03:53:31.969]  They just did that again?
[03:53:33.547 --> 03:53:34.147]  They did it again.
[03:53:34.287 --> 03:53:34.988]  They did it again.
[03:53:35.068 --> 03:53:36.109]  Him and two other people.
[03:53:36.549 --> 03:53:40.051]  Jim Everard and their camera woman, Joanna Castro.
[03:53:41.032 --> 03:53:44.093]  And so I just wanted to let you know and let everybody else out there know.
[03:53:44.133 --> 03:53:48.576]  I'm sure many InfoWarriors know we're all pretty much smart people here.
[03:53:48.716 --> 03:53:49.697]  You know, we're not dumb.
[03:53:50.137 --> 03:53:55.700]  So, you know, I just wanted to let you know and I wanted to, you know, just say thanks for everything you do.
[03:53:55.781 --> 03:53:59.143]  I know you say don't say thank you, but I got you, man.
[03:53:59.403 --> 03:54:01.264]  You know, you're tip of the spear.
[03:54:01.824 --> 03:54:04.527]  You know, so I just want to get that out to all the NFL Warriors out there.
[03:54:04.867 --> 03:54:05.728]  Well, let me just say this.
[03:54:05.768 --> 03:54:06.529]  God bless you, Chris.
[03:54:07.149 --> 03:54:09.572]  I just want you to focus on how you are the key to everything.
[03:54:10.072 --> 03:54:10.372]  Okay?
[03:54:10.573 --> 03:54:11.293]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:54:11.313 --> 03:54:12.034]  Here's the thing.
[03:54:13.260 --> 03:54:16.642]  And I know you guys are strong-minded, but they're probably going to destroy me in the end.
[03:54:16.662 --> 03:54:20.363]  And I'm not lying to them, and they're going to lie, and so that image will be destroyed.
[03:54:20.744 --> 03:54:22.404]  I should destroy it first before they do it.
[03:54:22.785 --> 03:54:23.765]  You are the future.
[03:54:23.885 --> 03:54:24.826]  You are the resistance.
[03:54:25.146 --> 03:54:25.826]  You are the answer.
[03:54:25.846 --> 03:54:26.907]  So that's why I do that.
[03:54:26.927 --> 03:54:27.527]  But God bless you.
[03:54:27.547 --> 03:54:28.107]  I appreciate you.
[03:54:28.708 --> 03:54:29.968]  It's you, not me.
[03:54:30.168 --> 03:54:33.210]  All of us together, my children, your children, they're the future.
[03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:37.432]  And I've just studied history, and I don't want to make it about me because
[03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:43.151]  Even, they'll kill me, or they'll lobotomize me and roll me out on TV to say whatever they want.
[03:54:43.552 --> 03:54:45.032]  Just forget about Alex Jones.
[03:54:45.933 --> 03:54:47.554]  Just remember, we're all in this together.
[03:54:47.614 --> 03:54:48.434]  That's the secret.
[03:54:49.375 --> 03:54:49.935]  Thank you, Chris.
[03:54:50.515 --> 03:54:53.937]  But yeah, Roger, I feel America's spirit so strong right now.
[03:54:53.957 --> 03:54:59.020]  I was really depressed yesterday, and Paul Watson off-air told me, he said, Alex, our approval ratings are way up.
[03:54:59.060 --> 03:55:00.000]  Conservatives are way up.
[03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:00.761]  This backfired.
[03:55:00.781 --> 03:55:01.741]  Stop being so bummed out.
[03:55:02.101 --> 03:55:05.183]  I just, seeing how openly evil they are gets me freaked out.
[03:55:06.601 --> 03:55:10.255]  Well, but they are they're stuck in their own bullshit.
[03:55:10.496 --> 03:55:11.902]  They're trying to resettle up.
[03:55:14.667 --> 03:55:19.570]  Delusion, delusion, when the public has lost interest, our listeners aren't interested.
[03:55:19.650 --> 03:55:20.810]  It's been debunked.
[03:55:20.890 --> 03:55:21.591]  It's nonsense.
[03:55:22.071 --> 03:55:22.331]  Over.
[03:55:22.832 --> 03:55:25.933]  People now want to focus on the fight we're having.
[03:55:25.953 --> 03:55:27.074]  It's completely clear.
[03:55:27.194 --> 03:55:32.437]  We're the people that want prosperity and guns in America and 57 Chevys and Marilyn Monroe.
[03:55:32.517 --> 03:55:35.418]  Get out of exactly this claim that we're the enemy.
[03:55:35.599 --> 03:55:37.259]  We're the globalists of the foreign power.
[03:55:37.300 --> 03:55:38.020]  They're the enemy.
[03:55:39.595 --> 03:55:43.136]  So, I think they're very much in retreat.
[03:55:44.797 --> 03:55:51.978]  This is why the brazenness of their fake news outlets, smearing you, smearing me, misses the point.
[03:55:52.239 --> 03:55:53.359]  It's not about us.
[03:55:53.679 --> 03:55:57.140]  It's about a larger movement to bring this country back to fundamentals.
[03:55:57.580 --> 03:55:59.661]  It's about a clash with the people.
[03:55:59.721 --> 03:56:06.182]  And that's why I keep telling the audience, support us to do that, but don't mentally make it about InfoWars or even me.
[03:56:06.462 --> 03:56:08.103]  Support us, yes, that's a key focal point.
[03:56:09.424 --> 03:56:10.404]  I can feel the power.
[03:56:10.444 --> 03:56:10.925]  I can see it.
[03:56:10.985 --> 03:56:11.565]  It's you.
[03:56:12.106 --> 03:56:13.286]  You have the power.
[03:56:13.607 --> 03:56:16.509]  That's what I'm trying to tell them is they are the victory.
[03:56:17.403 --> 03:56:20.024]  No, the movement's much larger than any of us.
[03:56:20.064 --> 03:56:23.605]  That's why we ask you to go to InfoWars where we have a donate button now.
[03:56:23.625 --> 03:56:34.148]  If you're not in the market for one of our great products, but you like what we're doing here, and you like the way we confront the globalists and we lead the war, well then send us a generous contribution.
[03:56:34.488 --> 03:56:45.091]  We don't have any... Exactly, support us and spread the word more than ever, but spiritually realize God and you individually with what you're doing in your area, you are the vanguard.
[03:56:45.112 --> 03:56:46.132]  That's all I'm trying to say is
[03:56:47.392 --> 03:56:50.475]  Is that I want to empower people to realize they are the answer.
[03:56:52.196 --> 03:57:02.724]  There's no question, which is why I tell people the single most important thing you can do as you follow InfoWars is find the stories and videos that you find most compelling that are most important.
[03:57:03.084 --> 03:57:06.166]  Pick up those links and put them out on your own social media.
[03:57:06.726 --> 03:57:10.249]  They can strangle us, but they cannot strangle all of us.
[03:57:10.749 --> 03:57:11.510]  And that act
[03:57:13.251 --> 03:57:20.957]  And by the way, we've been destroying them despite all their AI.
[03:57:21.778 --> 03:57:23.999]  I apologize to all these callers, but they're awesome.
[03:57:24.500 --> 03:57:25.361]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:57:26.292 --> 03:57:27.873]  And we're going to have another whole transmission.
[03:57:27.893 --> 03:57:28.653]  The War Room's coming up.
[03:57:28.693 --> 03:57:32.014]  You can call Owen and of course Roger Stone coming up.
[03:57:32.354 --> 03:57:35.276]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find that or local stations in your area.
[03:57:35.696 --> 03:57:36.856]  Another incredible transmission.
[03:57:36.916 --> 03:57:38.377]  Great job of this crew behind the scenes.
[03:57:38.397 --> 03:57:41.358]  But I don't give enough credit to and all of you that make this possible.
[03:57:41.398 --> 03:57:45.540]  We are all in this together and we are rising.
[03:57:45.780 --> 03:57:46.820]  Victory is rising.
[03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:48.881]  Human destiny is unstoppable.
[03:57:52.347 --> 03:57:58.612]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:57:59.474 --> 03:58:11.904]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[03:58:12.564 --> 03:58:23.053]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[03:58:51.912 --> 03:58:55.340]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[03:58:55.681 --> 03:58:59.650]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy.
