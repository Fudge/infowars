[00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.851]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:18.152]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:27.215]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:36.818]  Since my nomination in July, there's been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything, to block my confirmation.
[00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:46.141]  Shortly after I was nominated, the Democratic Senate leader said he would, quote, oppose me with everything he's got.
[00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:53.267]  A Democratic senator on this committee publicly referred to me as evil.
[00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:53.528]  Evil.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.740]  Think about that word.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:13.085]  The Socialist Democrat Piranhas and their secret weapon to derail the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh swarmed and fed upon the rights of the average American citizen while the media paraded Kavanaugh's accuser around as if she was just an average American citizen.
[00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:26.474]  Only when her name leaked out and the story started being told incorrectly did she take a deep breath and come forward and allow her identity to be known and to discuss this.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.722]  She's participating in our process and and she should be thanked for coming forward and it should be investigated fully.
[00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.943]  But now that she has America's attention, who is Christine Blasey Ford?
[00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:52.585]  I jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me and the last time that he did this we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.447]  Well, as Zero Hedge reported, Christine's father has worked and still works for the CIA.
[00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:14.664]  In addition to the other info that has recently surfaced, an article from the site Impious Digest states and cites numerous articles that Christine's father, Ralph G. Blasey Jr., had worked for the CIA and was a vice president at one time.
[00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:22.749]  For the National Savings and Trust Black Budget Bank, allegedly known for funding CIA deep state operations.
[00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:28.873]  Meanwhile, Christine Blasey Ford is being advised by attorneys tied to George Soros.
[00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.154]  It was a bitter feud to the very end.
[00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:32.896]  We're going to fight back.
[00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:33.896]  We are going to resist.
[00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:34.957]  We will not be silent.
[00:02:35.237 --> 00:02:58.084]  Slate writes, Bromwich, a Harvard Law graduate and former federal prosecutor, was known before this hearing for assisting the investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and more recently for representing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired in March by Jeff Sessions two days before his scheduled retirement and for whom Bromwich helped crowdfund legal fees.
[00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:02.425]  This is what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life.
[00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:05.006]  It was hard for me to breathe.
[00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:13.609]  Mom listening to this and she's putting her neck down into her chest so that she sounds like this and it comes out real croaky.
[00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.051]  This is a prepared speech that later she tells you she wrote herself.
[00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:18.851]  No one helped her.
[00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:27.675]  So she's gone over this, re-read it, practiced and has really figured out how to sound kind of croaky so that it sounds like there's mucus there.
[00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:28.955]  And that's practice.
[00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:41.721]  Because if there was any mucus there, for as long as she's going on, and for as traumatic as she says this is, we should not only, one, hear it, but she should be lifting her head up to fight it from coming out.
[00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.002]  And we do not see that.
[00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:48.924]  We see a position that she's forcing her voice to sound as if she does, with no evidence of it.
[00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.645]  This is a manipulation tactic.
[00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:56.329]  There was something particularly odd about Christine Blasey Ford's demeanor.
[00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.973]  The media was quick to dismiss her strange behavior as a result of PTSD.
[00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:06.996]  Have there been other things then that have contributed to the anxiety and PTSD that you suffered?
[00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:21.857]  Well, I think there's sort of biological predispositions that everyone in here has for particular disorders, so I can't rule out that I would have some biological predisposition to be an anxious type person.
[00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:30.343]  But during a break in the hearings, callers in the C-SPAN, who had suffered far more intense sexual abuse, found Ford's demeanor theatric.
[00:04:30.883 --> 00:04:36.506]  I had an older gentleman when I was 16, actually my boyfriend's dad, he raped me.
[00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:41.408]  And his son actually had to pull him off of me, my boyfriend, his brother.
[00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:46.411]  And then I tried to get away and he tried to run me over in the field while I was trying to get away.
[00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.412]  If that wasn't bad enough, then my father raped me.
[00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:52.474]  So I couldn't even tell my father about this stuff, okay?
[00:04:52.474 --> 00:04:54.095]  And I blocked this all out of me.
[00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.756]  Just like they said, eight years I blocked my dad out.
[00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:04.392]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:07.676]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:13.945]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:16.728]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.270]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.752]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:32.714]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:37.386]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:44.590]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.793]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:55.496]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.496 --> 00:05:59.478]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:05.813]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:14.657]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:19.619]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.879]  U.S.
[00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:28.223]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:31.104]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:32.585]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:35.047]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:06:35.047 --> 00:06:37.409]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.510]  This is all confirmed.
[00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.611]  This is not a drill.
[00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:43.875]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:45.416]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:46.297]  Apple 100%.
[00:06:46.297 --> 00:06:51.902]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:06:52.362 --> 00:06:57.426]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:06:57.426 --> 00:06:58.307]  This is happening.
[00:06:58.307 --> 00:07:06.333]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:12.698]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:20.664]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:25.367]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:28.890]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:39.138]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:07:39.138 --> 00:07:44.382]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:47.065]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:54.893]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:15.411]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:20.675]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:25.559]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:34.102]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:41.265]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:46.848]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:08:46.848 --> 00:08:51.490]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.810]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.711]  Now break free!
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:07.982]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:10.523]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:16.804]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:16.804 --> 00:09:19.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:24.566]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:36.563]  Totalitarianism, authoritarianism follows patterns.
[00:09:36.563 --> 00:09:41.806]  This is the seasons.
[00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:45.768]  And we are going into worldwide planetary authoritarianism.
[00:09:45.768 --> 00:09:58.435]  But in the midst of that, humanity is trying to short-circuit the cycle and trying to stop it with populist, nationalist, free-market, Christian, patriot uprisings happening all over the globe.
[00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:06.589]  We found at the tip of the spear, my friends, the most banned broadcast in the world, aided by tyrants and control freaks everywhere.
[00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:11.753]  We are only 33 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:10:11.753 --> 00:10:16.916]  It is the fourth day of October 2018.
[00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.518]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:41.073]  I was almost late getting into the studio today because I was doing deep research the last few hours at home and here at the office shooting a special report that I'm going to air tomorrow titled, Tim Cook is the most dangerous man in the world.
[00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:50.601]  And that will have all the video clips and all the proof and his own speeches saying he wants planetary authoritarianism and that he is
[00:10:52.299 --> 00:10:58.884]  The man between Communist China, the EU, and big tech here in America, leading everything.
[00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:03.007]  And I began to figure this out a few years ago, and I went public with it in the last year.
[00:11:03.007 --> 00:11:07.930]  Of course, then you notice he led the operation to have me de-platformed.
[00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:18.238]  And he's been out further engaging in his activity in the last few days, trying to shore up this theft of the First Amendment.
[00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:31.571]  And so today, later in the hour, I'm going to get into Tim Cook and what he's done.
[00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:40.493]  Because I knew he'd said these things and done these things, but I did a bunch of research last night and this morning, and so did Rob Do.
[00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:45.174]  And it was going to take me five minutes to shoot this video earlier I shot, but I ended up shooting 20 minutes.
[00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:55.832]  And I ended up just spending all this time re-reading what he said and did and watching the clips, and it's just staggering.
[00:11:55.832 --> 00:12:00.993]  He says, yeah, we're helping round up people in China, and I'm all for censorship, and I'm ready for the U.S.
[00:12:00.993 --> 00:12:04.774]  to do it.
[00:12:04.774 --> 00:12:05.594]  I'd forgotten that.
[00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:06.614]  He said that last year.
[00:12:06.614 --> 00:12:13.916]  He went before Congress, and when they had human rights activists there, he made fun of them, and made fun of the Senate.
[00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:27.440]  Now, I'll make fun of corrupt people in the Senate, but as the Senate as a whole, when they were doing good stuff, saying, why are you helping round up dissidents?
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:36.364]  He was very insulting and arrogant, showing he thinks they're a joke and he doesn't respect them because they don't know what they're dealing with.
[00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:38.766]  Well, I do.
[00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:42.768]  And I know exactly what Tim Cook's done.
[00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:46.029]  And it may have me pushing daisies.
[00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:47.110]  I'm going to tell you everything.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.844]  Because I'm not going to sit here and watch this piece of trash get away with this.
[00:12:56.844 --> 00:13:07.872]  I don't know about you, but I'm not going to commit our children and our children's children and their children and humanity to the nightmare system these technocrats are building.
[00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:13.096]  And Tim Cook is at the center of the whole thing just as bad as Bill Gates.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.782]  But I don't see Bill Gates running around openly saying, let's censor Americans and Europeans.
[00:13:21.782 --> 00:13:23.663]  Well, guess what?
[00:13:23.663 --> 00:13:28.005]  Tim Cook's doing it.
[00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:32.567]  And he sits there in glad hands and BS's Trump, makes me sick.
[00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:41.431]  Here's an example of what's coming up.
[00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:46.113]  Anti-meme law could see Mexicans jailed for posting insulting images
[00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:53.964]  And the example given is the famous image of the girlfriend with her boyfriend and he's looking back at the other girl.
[00:13:53.964 --> 00:13:56.145]  That'll get you a couple years in jail.
[00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:57.545]  Europe's already passed the law.
[00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.186]  People said six months ago they'd never do it.
[00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:01.887]  They passed it last month.
[00:14:01.887 --> 00:14:03.207]  The Muslim countries are doing it.
[00:14:03.207 --> 00:14:04.528]  It's happening in Latin America.
[00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:07.949]  This is the London Independent.
[00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:12.298]  Here's another one.
[00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:16.561]  Wikipedia bans Breitbart and Alex Jones Infowars as factual sources.
[00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:24.687]  They said, quote, it's my view that we should not source anything from Breitbart.
[00:14:24.687 --> 00:14:28.770]  See, now remove Breitbart, remove Infowars, remove my name.
[00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.133]  You see, it's a war on language.
[00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:34.254]  Football coach says the reps raped us.
[00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:36.016]  You're fired.
[00:14:36.016 --> 00:14:37.176]  Can't use the word rape.
[00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.798]  It's so, oh, this is named Lynch Hall?
[00:14:40.128 --> 00:14:41.889]  Well, that's an Irish name, but it scares me.
[00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:43.470]  It reminds me of blacks being lynched.
[00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.471]  So, we're going to change the name of the hall.
[00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:47.152]  This is just authoritarianism.
[00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:51.575]  And there's a hysteria of authoritarianism going on.
[00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.716]  And it's all intensifying.
[00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:55.317]  And Tucker Carlson covered it last time.
[00:14:55.317 --> 00:14:58.079]  We've got a clip of that coming up.
[00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.179]  But this is a big deal.
[00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:01.040]  They're coming after everybody now.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.621]  It's global.
[00:15:01.621 --> 00:15:02.361]  It's concerted.
[00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.103]  But it gets worse.
[00:15:06.103 --> 00:15:08.565]  I looked it up, and we were the first people to cover it.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.701]  Ten years ago, Chinese spy chips in U.S.
[00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.842]  devices, InfoWars was first.
[00:15:16.842 --> 00:15:25.405]  And if you go search it, and bing, with InfoWars.com out the side, and search web, or DuckDuckGo or whatever, Google doesn't work.

[00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:06.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:36.309]  So, I have been removed off of the air, or off of major platforms all over the country and all over the world, because the big megacorporations
[00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:57.148]  Don't want to have a real debate about what they're doing and how they're stealing the future of you and your entire family.
[00:20:57.148 --> 00:20:59.429]  And it's because we are tomorrow's news today.
[00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:12.992]  Because we first told folks about wireless chips built in that the communist Chinese could then basically hack into over your wireless network.
[00:21:12.992 --> 00:21:13.952]  We have been penalized.
[00:21:13.952 --> 00:21:14.972]  We have been demonized.
[00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:17.353]  But we were the first to talk about that.
[00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:19.253]  And now it's all over the news today.
[00:21:20.267 --> 00:21:26.170]  Well, what else have we been the first to talk about?
[00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:34.014]  Obama put an internet kill switch in about eight years ago, about two years into his administration.
[00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:38.477]  And it was called the internet kill switch, and we were the first to talk about that.
[00:21:38.477 --> 00:21:39.778]  And Matt Drudge covered it as well.
[00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:41.038]  And people said, oh, that doesn't exist.
[00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:43.099]  And later they said, oh, it does.
[00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:49.523]  Or they can send emergency alerts to all your phones, turn your phones on, turn them off, take over all the radios, all the TVs.
[00:21:51.749 --> 00:22:05.574]  They've had systems like that since the 50s, but local stations would tune to one station that had the antennas and the feeds and the satellite dishes to do it.
[00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.915]  But under Obama, everything got hardwired through it.
[00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:30.742]  And then Obama declared a series of national emergencies that got almost no attention, putting all these different systems under the control of bureaucracies, not under the Congress, and not even under the President, because they were meant to operate in case the President and the Congress were killed.
[00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:35.824]  But as you've seen, Trump is in office, but almost the entire government
[00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.271]  For the first year and a half or so, ignored everything he said and did the opposite.
[00:22:41.271 --> 00:22:45.933]  He got a few things done through executive power, and that turned a lot of things around.
[00:22:45.933 --> 00:22:48.913]  Now he's starting to get a little bit of executive control.
[00:22:48.913 --> 00:22:51.494]  Maybe 30-40%, instead of 10%.
[00:22:51.494 --> 00:23:03.818]  And they're panicking because they know he'll right the ship, you'll be sold on the return of America, and that's it for them, because people will have the epiphany, the absolute awakening,
[00:23:05.595 --> 00:23:11.819]  That the revelation that this was done purposely.
[00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:19.504]  And that's why I bring you this next piece of information.
[00:23:19.504 --> 00:23:22.826]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:24.888]  That's why I've been hammering on this.
[00:23:24.888 --> 00:23:32.313]  Notice you get next week's news today, next month's news today, next year's news today, and not because I'm that smart.
[00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:37.114]  Because I'm studying what the real system's doing.
[00:23:37.114 --> 00:23:42.738]  The big megacorporations, the other power players, and the bureaucracy.
[00:23:42.738 --> 00:23:46.340]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.142]  1776 worldwide.
[00:23:48.142 --> 00:23:49.182]  Self-determination.
[00:23:49.182 --> 00:23:51.004]  Kicking Soros out of Europe.
[00:23:51.004 --> 00:23:56.668]  All the things you first heard here are now household topics.
[00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.429]  That's why I'm slated for destruction.
[00:23:59.864 --> 00:24:03.686]  Not because I'm inaccurate, not because I'm fake, but because I'm real.
[00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:12.849]  And I tell you that so that of this whole spectrum of information you see out there, a lot of people get confused and don't know what to believe.
[00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:14.570]  Folks, don't believe me.
[00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.550]  Believe your memory.
[00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:20.692]  Believe everything I told you has now come true.
[00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:25.274]  Remember about three weeks ago we said Trump needs to declare a civil emergency?
[00:24:26.837 --> 00:24:33.982]  Because we're already under an emergency and under those emergency executive orders only a new emergency can countermand it.
[00:24:33.982 --> 00:24:50.232]  And so you declare a new emergency to end the last emergency and you remove the emergency powers just like he did with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and they called him a dictator because he has dictatorial power over trade that was given to him by the Democrats and Republicans because they thought they'd have Hillary in.
[00:24:53.683 --> 00:24:55.845]  That was done the last few years of Obama.
[00:24:55.845 --> 00:25:00.588]  The President was pretty much made a dictator.
[00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:09.855]  But... But... It's sophisticated.
[00:25:09.855 --> 00:25:11.997]  And the average person just wants to score points.
[00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:16.540]  Because if you're anti-Alex Jones, Google, Facebook, Twitter will promote you.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.361]  That's fine.
[00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:19.722]  Children can be children.
[00:25:19.722 --> 00:25:21.724]  And be magnified by the B system.
[00:25:21.724 --> 00:25:22.925]  I will tell the truth no matter what.
[00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:25.272]  That's my North Star.
[00:25:25.272 --> 00:25:26.533]  I don't want martial law.
[00:25:26.533 --> 00:25:27.774]  I don't want tanks in the streets.
[00:25:27.774 --> 00:25:29.595]  I don't want lining people up and shooting them.
[00:25:29.595 --> 00:25:31.097]  That's what the left wants.
[00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:32.258]  That's what they're pushing.
[00:25:32.258 --> 00:25:37.562]  That's what they've always been desiring.
[00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:41.365]  And so they are trying to overthrow the president and the elected government.
[00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:47.850]  They're trying to use the COG systems that Obama put in place that Trump hasn't gotten rid of
[00:25:48.974 --> 00:26:10.769]  As the takeover mechanism, and they're using Obama and Hillary, still command and controlling, through big tech, through the State Department, and through state-behind networks at the Justice Department, and CIA, to believe they're the legitimate government, blocking Trump, under the rubric of him being a Russian agent with no proof.
[00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:13.611]  As that dissolves, and the economy comes back,
[00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:25.546]  As the economy comes back and as they realize what's happening, the globalists are going into total panic mode.
[00:26:25.546 --> 00:26:26.648]  So I'm going to explain it again.
[00:26:28.274 --> 00:26:32.556]  We've been under civil emergency since 1933 with the War Powers Act.
[00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:35.878]  It got more intense under almost every other president since then.
[00:26:35.878 --> 00:26:50.306]  And since the mid-1960s, we've been under a form of martial law where most of the regular law in due process doesn't operate and presidents declare a new emergency every year to operate outside of the Constitution.
[00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:54.489]  Trump's trying to bring power back to the nation states.
[00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:56.851]  He's trying to educate people about this.
[00:26:56.851 --> 00:27:00.274]  He's giving speeches about power back to the people, back to the states.
[00:27:01.701 --> 00:27:11.209]  But he's faced with martial law that Obama put in place, and now they call it civil emergency, national emergency, 25th Amendment, CNN.
[00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:18.255]  Removing President Trump under 25th Amendment is political Armageddon martial law.
[00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:25.461]  Atlantic Monthly, it's time to talk about presidential succession and removing him under a civil emergency.
[00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:27.083]  They won't call it martial law.
[00:27:30.026 --> 00:27:36.774]  So, I'm not calling for a martial law.
[00:27:36.774 --> 00:27:44.384]  It's like Red Adair learned how to blow up oil well fires that were on explosive fire with explosives.
[00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:50.328]  You'd blow up the fire with fire to take the oxygen out and put the fire out.
[00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:56.912]  I'm saying, under law, under the emergency powers, that I pioneered exposing the last 23 years on air.
[00:27:56.912 --> 00:27:57.633]  Everyone knows that.
[00:27:57.633 --> 00:28:01.015]  They're like, you're the expert on martial law and police stated, now you want it.
[00:28:01.015 --> 00:28:02.996]  No, I don't!
[00:28:02.996 --> 00:28:04.117]  That's not what I said!
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.311]  They're the ones saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:09.111]  They're the ones saying we'll kill you in your houses.
[00:28:09.111 --> 00:28:10.752]  They're the ones gearing up for total war.
[00:28:10.752 --> 00:28:11.992]  They're the ones shooting people.
[00:28:11.992 --> 00:28:13.452]  They're the ones saying civil emergency.
[00:28:13.452 --> 00:28:14.873]  They're the ones saying 25th Amendment.
[00:28:14.873 --> 00:28:16.513]  They're the ones saying remove Trump.
[00:28:16.513 --> 00:28:18.354]  They're the ones saying kill Trump.
[00:28:18.354 --> 00:28:19.074]  Kill his family.
[00:28:19.074 --> 00:28:19.974]  Kill everybody.
[00:28:19.974 --> 00:28:24.315]  No one's safe in their houses.
[00:28:24.315 --> 00:28:26.956]  They're the ones, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:30.457]  And so I'm saying we have to get informed on this and understand it.
[00:28:30.457 --> 00:28:33.478]  And the reason I bring this up will cover, coming up,
[00:28:34.352 --> 00:28:38.294]  Then I'll get into Tim Cook, the most evil man in the world.
[00:28:38.294 --> 00:28:38.715]  Literally.
[00:28:38.715 --> 00:28:42.857]  A key individual.
[00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:46.939]  We're gonna look at why the left's claiming that EAS alert is martial law.
[00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:48.500]  Because you know what?
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.901]  It is!
[00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:51.162]  Exactly!
[00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.663]  And notice we're already under it, dumbasses!
[00:28:53.663 --> 00:28:56.705]  I'm not saying that to our audience, I'm saying that to the little globalist minions.
[00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:02.251]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:07.153]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[00:29:07.153 --> 00:29:12.736]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.

[00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:06.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.723 --> 00:33:25.929]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:34.917]  So, I've got tons of riveting reports, incredible stuff our reporters have discovered, amazing information from InfoWars.com.
[00:33:34.917 --> 00:33:37.699]  And I'm gonna get to it in an hour or two and three and four.
[00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:39.801]  But, I'm gonna go back to this.
[00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:40.982]  We're in World War IV.
[00:33:44.139 --> 00:33:59.607]  Communist China that's killed five times what Hitler killed is in league with Apple and Google and others who've made the decision to go off the edge of a cliff and actually aid China in hacking and spying on the U.S.
[00:33:59.607 --> 00:34:04.489]  Apple and Google have refused to even work with the Pentagon on anything.
[00:34:04.489 --> 00:34:08.591]  Tim Cook has announced that they're officially now in China and that is their future.
[00:34:10.794 --> 00:34:13.435]  I am getting rid of all Apple products in the building.
[00:34:13.435 --> 00:34:18.498]  We always had them because they had cheaper video editing stuff 20 years ago.
[00:34:18.498 --> 00:34:21.579]  The last five years, it's all gone to crap because they focus on phones now.
[00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:22.820]  It's an easy segue.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.741]  Their phones are triple cost.
[00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:26.662]  They have even more problems than ever.
[00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:30.124]  My whole family, everyone is moving to PC and Android.
[00:34:30.124 --> 00:34:34.746]  At least they don't have slave factories in areas like South Korea.
[00:34:36.331 --> 00:34:37.812]  So, we're done.
[00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:40.653]  And I'm not buying anything from China, unless I have to.
[00:34:40.653 --> 00:34:46.955]  Now, that said, Tucker Carlson broke down the censorship against him four hours and more last night.
[00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:47.975]  I'm going to cover that.
[00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:52.617]  But as I said, next segment, I want to have a special message to Tim Cook.
[00:34:52.617 --> 00:34:55.078]  Alex Jones' message to Tim Cook.
[00:34:55.078 --> 00:34:58.519]  You are the most evil man in the world today.
[00:34:58.519 --> 00:34:59.620]  He's key.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.261]  And it hit me a while back.
[00:35:01.261 --> 00:35:04.722]  And then, of course, it became self-fulfilling that he's the one that got me deplatformed.
[00:35:05.669 --> 00:35:08.491]  I don't take that as, Oh God, Alex, why?
[00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:09.972]  You know, your stock's gone down.
[00:35:09.972 --> 00:35:19.598]  You're getting censored by somebody that went to China in four speeches we've got video of and a congressional testimony and speeches here in the US.
[00:35:19.598 --> 00:35:30.726]  It's like seven, eight speeches saying, I'm censoring in China and I want to do it in America.
[00:35:30.726 --> 00:35:35.529]  That's how a tyrant does it, man, is they come to the bar and they set their huevos on the table.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:46.684]  We got video of him making fun of protesters in the Senate last year and making fun of Congress worried about China and human rights abuses.
[00:35:46.684 --> 00:35:53.668]  I mean, he is an arrogant leftist monster.
[00:35:53.668 --> 00:35:54.489]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:54.489 --> 00:36:05.015]  Now, Michael Moore has come out with the wild conspiracy theory the Daily Wire says that
[00:36:06.115 --> 00:36:22.941]  Trump is testing the emergency alert system to everybody's phone that happened yesterday at 2 o'clock, 218 Eastern, because Trump's getting ready for martial law and a civil emergency to stop the election.
[00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:33.165]  And there's an article on Infowars.com where the left went completely crazy and said they're going to smash their phones and how dare Trump rape them this way, forcing this onto them.
[00:36:33.165 --> 00:36:35.606]  But let me give you the facts here right now.
[00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:50.072]  The EAS system is martial law.
[00:36:50.072 --> 00:36:59.205]  We've been under a civil emergency since 1933, the War Powers Act, and then it's been reissued every year since then and it's only gotten more expansive under Obama.
[00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.587]  And they handed dictatorial powers to the presidency.
[00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:14.858]  That's why the left is so panicked and blocking all of Trump's orders and saying he's insane because he could use the dictatorial power to stop all the things they've done like TPP, if he realizes that power.
[00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:21.884]  And then he could have those powers revoked by Congress that have voted to give him those powers.
[00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:26.459]  That's getting rid of martial law.
[00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:29.159]  That's getting rid of civil emergency.
[00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:37.621]  Not calling for martial law like my detractors said I did three weeks ago.
[00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:42.102]  Technically, all of these are civil emergencies.
[00:37:42.102 --> 00:37:48.484]  And you've got the shadow breakaway government operating outside of law to block the president.
[00:37:48.484 --> 00:37:50.084]  And Mike Adams wrote an excellent article
[00:37:51.624 --> 00:38:02.088]  Dealing with this, signed executive order reveals Trump is planning mass arrests, military tribunals for deep state traitors like Comey, Clinton, Obama.
[00:38:02.088 --> 00:38:04.028]  Now that's Mike Adams writing about it from that angle.
[00:38:04.028 --> 00:38:10.430]  I contacted Mike and I said, Mike, you're looking at it from one angle.
[00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.631]  I'm looking at it from this angle over here.
[00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:17.993]  We're already under the civil emergency because his article points out the civil emergency, the martial law provisions.
[00:38:17.993 --> 00:38:20.854]  He names the executive orders that Obama put into power.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.362]  Assessment of national security, emergency preparedness, communications functions.
[00:38:25.362 --> 00:38:27.963]  That's what you just saw Trump do yesterday.
[00:38:27.963 --> 00:38:29.404]  All of this.
[00:38:29.404 --> 00:38:33.846]  Document 3, Executive Order 13852, March 1st, 2018.
[00:38:33.846 --> 00:38:40.249]  Amendments to the Manual for Court Martial United States, which does deal with domestic stuff.
[00:38:40.249 --> 00:38:40.749]  So it's true.
[00:38:40.749 --> 00:38:43.610]  Executive Order 13618.
[00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:44.050]  Executive Order 13818.
[00:38:50.848 --> 00:38:54.849]  Blocking the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuse and corruption.
[00:38:54.849 --> 00:38:57.329]  It's all right there.
[00:38:57.329 --> 00:39:00.770]  What Mike points out is true.
[00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:10.071]  And so, now you've got Michael Moore running around, and there's a kernel of truth there, that the martial law civil emergency's already there.
[00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:16.393]  But Trump didn't walk in and say, oh, I'm the dictator over TPP, signing over our authority to foreign globalist interests and selling on America.
[00:39:16.393 --> 00:39:18.593]  I say we totally are pulling out of this.
[00:39:19.884 --> 00:39:26.209]  And we'll have a big transparent debate about this and renegotiate it if the American people want that.
[00:39:26.209 --> 00:39:37.797]  So see, Moore's mad because he knows the inside baseball and they know that they gave the presidency under Bush and under Obama dictatorial powers.
[00:39:39.625 --> 00:39:46.550]  And so now Trump's got those powers, which I say are unconstitutional, many of them, and Trump's not even using those powers.
[00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:53.796]  He's not even using normal constitutional power to fire people like Rosenstein or Mueller.
[00:39:53.796 --> 00:39:59.240]  He's been incredibly restrained, the opposite of what Michael Moore said he's done.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.523]  So I want to have a debate about the fact that we're still under this civil emergency.
[00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:07.362]  And just educate people so we can have a discussion.
[00:40:07.362 --> 00:40:18.768]  Kind of like I try to educate the President about Google and Apple moving to China and censoring the American people and selling out our secrets and why the globalists don't respect Congress or the President because they've already sold us out so bad they think we'll never figure it out.
[00:40:18.768 --> 00:40:21.029]  Well, I'm here blowing the whistle.
[00:40:21.029 --> 00:40:23.330]  I'm here raising the alarm on the parapet.
[00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:27.433]  Hey, there's enemies lower in the drawbridge at midnight for the enemy to enter the gates.
[00:40:28.553 --> 00:40:39.360]  Arrest those people opening the gate and start firing archers, arrows down at the enemy to pin them down so they don't get that drawbridge completely open.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.700]  We already have the drawbridge open.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.141]  The enemy's already basically entered.
[00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:43.422]  Now, more is pouring in.
[00:40:43.422 --> 00:40:52.988]  I'm trying to fight to get to the controls of the drawbridge to lift that sucker up and then clamp those doors shut as quickly as possible.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.691]  So this country's in an emergency.
[00:40:57.691 --> 00:41:09.235]  The left's running around threatening to kill and killing people and bullying and doxing folks and attacking and lying and using CIA operatives to go make false allegations and destroying due process.
[00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:12.996]  And they're saying they want an open civil emergency on CNN to remove Trump.
[00:41:13.993 --> 00:41:25.379]  They are the ones wanting the illegitimate COG Deep State to make their move on the election, to make their move on the presidency, to make their move on you 33 days out.
[00:41:25.379 --> 00:41:30.342]  Ryerson's getting mailed to the White House, the Pentagon, to Ted Cruz's offices in Houston.
[00:41:30.342 --> 00:41:32.063]  All hell's already breaking loose.
[00:41:32.063 --> 00:41:37.386]  The left is just escalating their violence into stratospheric, thumb-at-the-mouth insanity.
[00:41:37.386 --> 00:41:41.929]  And you better believe you're going to see unbelievable fireworks.
[00:41:43.123 --> 00:41:45.624]  In the next 33 days.
[00:41:45.624 --> 00:41:47.746]  They're trying to pull false flags to blame us.
[00:41:47.746 --> 00:41:51.968]  They're trying to set me up as violent and lying and saying I'm calling for violence.
[00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:53.489]  And then never showing the proof.
[00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:59.493]  They're silencing myself and many others ahead of the big event or events.
[00:41:59.493 --> 00:42:01.674]  So now is the time for maximum vigilance.
[00:42:03.706 --> 00:42:12.550]  Especially because they know that a red wave's coming and all the polls, even their skewed polls show it.
[00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.931]  They know humanity's awoken to them.
[00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:16.392]  They know.
[00:42:16.392 --> 00:42:19.233]  So they're trying to put on a confidence act.
[00:42:19.233 --> 00:42:23.695]  They're trying to sell everybody on going back to sleep.
[00:42:23.695 --> 00:42:24.735]  They're trying to do this.
[00:42:24.735 --> 00:42:26.016]  It's not working.
[00:42:26.016 --> 00:42:27.056]  But here's the thing.
[00:42:27.056 --> 00:42:28.357]  We are in a fight for our lives.
[00:42:29.656 --> 00:42:39.622]  Now, when we come back, the latest on Apple working with China to infiltrate, not just all your code keys to China, which is public, they have the passcodes to everything in your Apple, my office, you name it, everything.
[00:42:39.622 --> 00:42:41.483]  The Chinese government officially has it.
[00:42:41.483 --> 00:42:42.864]  Apple brags about it in plain view.
[00:42:42.864 --> 00:42:43.824]  Tim Cook.
[00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:48.947]  Now they're putting chips in all the devices to break into everything else in your house or business.
[00:42:48.947 --> 00:42:51.909]  Apple products must be banned from all U.S.
[00:42:51.909 --> 00:42:54.451]  government facilities, bare minimum, now.
[00:42:54.451 --> 00:42:56.312]  Tim Cook needs to be clapped in irons.
[00:42:59.289 --> 00:43:03.226]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:13.243]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:43:13.243 --> 00:43:15.244]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:18.685]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:43:18.685 --> 00:43:21.306]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:43:21.306 --> 00:43:23.586]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:43:23.586 --> 00:43:30.549]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:40.896]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:43:40.896 --> 00:43:42.077]  We'll win.
[00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:44.398]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:43:44.398 --> 00:43:52.123]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.

[00:47:28.632 --> 00:47:29.212]  Welcome back.
[00:47:29.212 --> 00:47:30.333]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.333 --> 00:47:33.275]  We're here live Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:47:33.275 --> 00:47:33.876]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:33.876 --> 00:47:34.236]  Central.
[00:47:34.236 --> 00:47:36.418]  Don't forget David Knight with a great broadcast.
[00:47:36.418 --> 00:47:37.819]  He has 8 a.m.
[00:47:37.819 --> 00:47:38.339]  to 11 a.m.
[00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:44.003]  Central in the War Room with Owen Schroeder, Rogers Kellner and others kicking butt from 3 p.m.
[00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:44.624]  to 6 p.m.
[00:47:44.624 --> 00:47:49.247]  More transmissions coming soon as well to expand the M4's lineup against the Globalist.
[00:47:49.247 --> 00:47:52.410]  We're now only 33 days out from this historic
[00:47:53.542 --> 00:47:57.883]  Midterm election and things are just gonna get more intense on from that point.
[00:47:57.883 --> 00:48:09.786]  I said that I would get into China and Apple and their latest mass spying on the American people And I'm going to be doing that but I'm gonna do that at 6 after next hour.
[00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:18.828]  This is just So incredibly important and then Millie Weaver is gonna be joining us She's been going to Trump rallies and boy the folks protesting Trump are
[00:48:21.377 --> 00:48:37.604]  Are illegal aliens wearing Mexico outfits, head to toe, red, white, and green, and saying, we're going to keep Mexico great, we're here to take over for Mexico?
[00:48:37.604 --> 00:48:40.426]  I mean, well then why did you come to the United States?
[00:48:40.426 --> 00:48:41.546]  Oh, it was Mexico!
[00:48:41.546 --> 00:48:43.047]  Yeah, and like five other countries too.
[00:48:44.485 --> 00:48:48.286]  Five other nations claim the Southwest and California, Texas, you name it.
[00:48:48.286 --> 00:48:51.107]  The French, the Russians out in California.
[00:48:51.107 --> 00:48:53.428]  Hell, the Russians had Washington State and Alaska.
[00:48:53.428 --> 00:48:56.669]  Does that mean the Russians get it?
[00:48:56.669 --> 00:48:58.330]  The Spanish?
[00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:02.732]  You know, my ancestors paid for the land.
[00:49:02.732 --> 00:49:11.875]  The Mexican government couldn't kill the Comanche, couldn't take them out, so they brought in the Scot and English and Irish and German settlers.
[00:49:12.878 --> 00:49:20.282]  And then ten years later, tried to take their guns, and well, you got what King George got in 1776, again.
[00:49:20.282 --> 00:49:24.245]  And then Santa Ana got overthrown in his own country, and lost Guatemala.
[00:49:24.245 --> 00:49:26.826]  But these people have no history.
[00:49:26.826 --> 00:49:34.231]  They just, we're in Tennessee, or we're in Ohio at these rallies, and we love Mexico and F-Trump!
[00:49:34.231 --> 00:49:36.072]  We're gonna be playing these videos here on air.
[00:49:36.072 --> 00:49:39.654]  We've blurred them out for TV viewers, and we've bleeped them for radio.
[00:49:40.697 --> 00:49:45.759]  Believe me, it's quite a job, but that is all coming up 15 minutes into the next hour.
[00:49:45.759 --> 00:49:51.682]  And it's the arrogance of the Larry Conquista, Mecha-type folks.
[00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:55.723]  This is taught in the colleges, it's taught in Mexico, and it's just people completely proud.
[00:49:55.723 --> 00:50:04.407]  I mean, can you imagine going to Mexico at one of their presidential election events and marching up in a red, white, and blue soccer outfit and saying, this is my country?
[00:50:04.407 --> 00:50:05.867]  And saying, I piss on Mexico?
[00:50:05.867 --> 00:50:07.288]  You'd get killed.
[00:50:10.094 --> 00:50:12.596]  But see, Mexico has extreme nationalism.
[00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:14.057]  At least they've got that.
[00:50:14.057 --> 00:50:15.217]  There's just no identities.
[00:50:15.217 --> 00:50:20.541]  We're a giant doormat to be walked on.
[00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:25.584]  And listen, it's not like if Mexico was better, if Mexico was like Switzerland.
[00:50:25.584 --> 00:50:29.006]  Second Amendment, you know, free speech, super wealthy, beautiful.
[00:50:29.006 --> 00:50:31.728]  I'd be like, okay, I kind of want to get conquered by you.
[00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.708]  Or it's not even being conquered.
[00:50:32.708 --> 00:50:33.409]  Okay, I'll marry you.
[00:50:35.222 --> 00:50:58.170]  Mexico, man, is the most violent country in the world, falling apart, and can't get its business in order, and then wants to lecture us with this whole anti-America, anti-white thing that it was totally manufactured by the left in this country and implanted down in Mexico.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.464]  See, I said I'd get into all this news, and I haven't, because I'm digressing.
[00:51:02.464 --> 00:51:04.266]  I'll tell you what's coming up, and I'll start getting into it right away.
[00:51:04.266 --> 00:51:04.727]  It's incredible.
[00:51:04.727 --> 00:51:07.371]  The videos are on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:09.651]  Get them.
[00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:11.072]  Everything we do is copyright free.
[00:51:11.072 --> 00:51:14.875]  Re-upload them, cut them up, share them, air them on your local radio station, TV station.
[00:51:14.875 --> 00:51:15.655]  I don't care.
[00:51:15.655 --> 00:51:16.836]  I'm not in competition with anybody.
[00:51:16.836 --> 00:51:21.279]  It's why I have them on Fox News people, why I have them on CRTV people.
[00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:23.040]  I love DrudgeReport.com.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.721]  I love other talk show hosts.
[00:51:24.721 --> 00:51:27.463]  I have hosts on that are on against me every day.
[00:51:27.463 --> 00:51:28.563]  And they're like, you're having me on?
[00:51:28.563 --> 00:51:29.344]  I'm on against you.
[00:51:29.344 --> 00:51:30.585]  I don't care.
[00:51:30.585 --> 00:51:34.427]  Thank God you're out there.
[00:51:34.427 --> 00:51:35.648]  I'm not in competition.
[00:51:38.476 --> 00:51:39.016]  With you.
[00:51:39.016 --> 00:51:40.396]  I'm in competition with the tyrants.
[00:51:40.396 --> 00:51:42.257]  I want to stop them.
[00:51:42.257 --> 00:51:45.818]  Now that said, bombshell.
[00:51:45.818 --> 00:51:47.218]  James Baker testimony.
[00:51:47.218 --> 00:51:54.059]  DNC lawyers were the source to the FBI of Russiagate.
[00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:54.919]  Now we learn.
[00:51:54.919 --> 00:51:57.300]  They're putting this out ahead of Trump releasing it.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.420]  And ahead of the Inspector General.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.300]  Because Trump said they'd be released quickly.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.501]  You notice the Democrats are doing it themselves to have the spin.
[00:52:04.858 --> 00:52:06.539]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, James Baker.
[00:52:06.539 --> 00:52:12.485]  Not the James Baker of Baker-Hostetler, also involved in the Piscate dossier, but the Democrats.
[00:52:12.485 --> 00:52:19.731]  The chief legal counsel, James Baker, for Lisa Page, Andy McCabe, and others.
[00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:22.954]  And look, right there, next to Mueller's main deputy.
[00:52:22.954 --> 00:52:25.816]  Go back, there's Mueller's main deputy with him.
[00:52:25.816 --> 00:52:28.699]  He's their lawyer, too.
[00:52:28.699 --> 00:52:29.680]  Forget his name, the black guy.
[00:52:30.762 --> 00:52:34.225]  There's no pointing at him with his name, but that's the number two guy under Mueller.
[00:52:34.225 --> 00:52:42.271]  They just all openly hang out together, trying to destroy Trump and take over the country, and they all work for Clinton!
[00:52:42.271 --> 00:52:44.133]  I mean, we already knew that.
[00:52:44.133 --> 00:52:45.774]  I know you're like, yeah, we already know that.
[00:52:45.774 --> 00:52:49.598]  I know, but it hasn't come out in the news yet.
[00:52:49.598 --> 00:52:55.262]  Yes, of course, Hillary and the Democrats, along with the blue-blood Republicans, cooked this all up.
[00:52:55.262 --> 00:52:57.824]  I mean, what a sick joke!
[00:52:57.824 --> 00:52:59.586]  These people think they can't be fired!
[00:53:02.196 --> 00:53:03.757]  Because they've got to stay behind network.
[00:53:03.757 --> 00:53:05.638]  They think they're under their own martial law.
[00:53:05.638 --> 00:53:06.459]  They're operating it.
[00:53:06.459 --> 00:53:16.285]  And Trump has to declare his own emergency, not tanks in the streets, to stop them from getting to tanks in the streets, to then remove all that with his new emergency that cuts through it.
[00:53:16.285 --> 00:53:19.507]  That's how they're able to stay in and then revoke the emergency forever.
[00:53:21.727 --> 00:53:23.008]  Oh, but the left goes, don't do that!
[00:53:23.008 --> 00:53:23.849]  That's martial law!
[00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:25.790]  God Jones wants tanks in the streets!
[00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:45.144]  Because they think you're stupid, they think you're dumb, but Trump dare not even fire people that are dereliction of duty and working with the Democrats and way out of bounds and breaking laws and caught lying to Congress and lying to him because, oh, he doesn't want to look like he's being political, you know, getting rid of Mueller and Rosenstein.
[00:53:45.144 --> 00:53:47.786]  He won't even use constitutional power!
[00:53:52.418 --> 00:53:54.780]  I'm laying out the facts.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:54:03.728]  When everything takes over your cell phone, you get an alert from the president, that's done under martial law provisions for an emergency.
[00:54:03.728 --> 00:54:08.473]  Doesn't mean I'm even against getting an EAS alert, but imagine what a tyrant could do with that.
[00:54:08.473 --> 00:54:09.774]  So Michael Moore's upset about it?
[00:54:09.774 --> 00:54:13.898]  Well, your boss put that in, jerk!
[00:54:13.898 --> 00:54:16.120]  So shut your big, fat, ugly head up.
[00:54:19.755 --> 00:54:22.897]  Now there's so much more I haven't gotten to, my head's spinning at this point.
[00:54:22.897 --> 00:54:26.679]  I want to get to Tucker Carlson talking about the censorship.
[00:54:26.679 --> 00:54:28.260]  Millie Weaver's coming up.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:36.025]  We've been interviewing the Iranian opposition group that just wants to make Iran great again, free market, pro-Christian.
[00:54:36.025 --> 00:54:42.109]  They realize that Iran's been taken over by Islamists hundreds of years ago and shouldn't even be Islamic.
[00:54:43.702 --> 00:54:45.803]  And they're for Islam to be there too.
[00:54:45.803 --> 00:54:48.485]  It's just that it's a very powerful interview.
[00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:51.307]  The last one we did, just covering, got millions of views.
[00:54:51.307 --> 00:54:56.170]  This new one, we're going to repost the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:59.393]  Tomorrow's news today, this guy has a good shot of being the next leader.
[00:54:59.393 --> 00:55:03.455]  He's something like 70% in polls in Iran, but they don't let them have elections.
[00:55:03.455 --> 00:55:07.218]  They have fake elections where the, it's like the Politburo and the Communists pick who can run.
[00:55:07.218 --> 00:55:12.502]  In Iran, the Mullahs pick who can run for president and they'll pick like the three and then you can vote on them.
[00:55:14.977 --> 00:55:18.858]  But sometimes if one starts winning they don't like, they'll remove them as well, so that's coming up.
[00:55:18.858 --> 00:55:21.679]  That said, it takes a lot of money to fight a war.
[00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:24.739]  It takes a lot of money to take on Soros and the Globalist.
[00:55:24.739 --> 00:55:26.660]  And I want to win this thing.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.101]  And I think Infowars should stay in the fight.
[00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:42.564]  If people don't go buy a bunch of t-shirts and water filters and air filtration and things you already need and non-gmo heirloom seeds and high quality organic Wake Up America coffee grown in southern Mexico in the high mountains and get the supplements, we will be destroyed.
[00:55:43.519 --> 00:55:46.280]  If you fund us with the millions of listeners we have, we're unstoppable.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:51.061]  So, we've got Happies, the new mood and stress natural herbal formula.
[00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:55.803]  Super concentrated, 50% off out of the gates, so you can try it and see how great it works.
[00:55:55.803 --> 00:55:56.883]  Works a little too good on me.
[00:55:56.883 --> 00:55:59.204]  My wife's like, what the hell are you on?
[00:55:59.204 --> 00:56:01.125]  It's totally natural, but it just smooths you out.
[00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:02.645]  It's not a depressant, it's not a stimulant.
[00:56:02.645 --> 00:56:03.385]  It's the opposite.
[00:56:03.385 --> 00:56:04.426]  It's just relaxing.
[00:56:05.266 --> 00:56:05.786]  Amazing.
[00:56:05.786 --> 00:56:09.428]  Happies, Mood and Stress, our newest product, $22.47.

[00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:16.252]  Also, we're going to have to end.
[00:56:16.252 --> 00:56:19.894]  I said today, just like I ended a week late, the X2 special.
[00:56:19.894 --> 00:56:20.855]  It did end.
[00:56:20.855 --> 00:56:24.877]  I've not come up with new specials yet, but we're about to sell out of Brain Force Plus.
[00:56:24.877 --> 00:56:26.418]  We're very close.
[00:56:26.418 --> 00:56:31.781]  And our other best-selling product, that is Secret 12, the purest, best
[00:56:32.947 --> 00:56:33.848]  Vitamin B12 out there.
[00:56:33.848 --> 00:56:38.894]  Even BuzzFeed tested it and said, okay, it's pure Methylcobalamin B12 and Acetamylcobalamin.
[00:56:38.894 --> 00:56:40.115]  But here's the best in the country.
[00:56:40.115 --> 00:56:41.096]  It's rated number one.
[00:56:41.096 --> 00:56:43.479]  We private label it jerk for less money.
[00:56:43.479 --> 00:56:44.320]  Boom!
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.242]  BuzzFeed rated us number one.
[00:56:46.242 --> 00:56:47.063]  Boom!
[00:56:47.063 --> 00:56:47.644]  Boom!
[00:56:47.644 --> 00:56:48.445]  Boom!
[00:56:48.445 --> 00:56:48.605]  So...
[00:56:52.622 --> 00:57:02.666]  So that's what this is coming down to, ladies and gentlemen, is InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:57:14.733 --> 00:57:17.095]  Alpha Power, better than Super Mel Vitality.
[00:57:17.095 --> 00:57:20.298]  Similar herbs, but different concentrates, different strengths.
[00:57:20.298 --> 00:57:22.820]  One's cold-pressed, one isn't, but it's a larger dose.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.464]  Some people may like, you know, one product over the other.
[00:57:27.464 --> 00:57:28.765]  That's why we got a lot of them.
[00:57:28.765 --> 00:57:33.990]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, but this has really got to be the last day to get the
[00:57:36.502 --> 00:57:40.045]  Rainforest Plus and the Secret 12 for 40% off.
[00:57:40.045 --> 00:57:42.807]  It's just got to stop because we're going to be sold out till December.
[00:57:42.807 --> 00:57:44.869]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:57:44.869 --> 00:57:50.073]  Please stay with us.

[00:59:53.224 --> 00:59:55.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.091 --> 01:00:20.416]  Let's just not do the show today and listen to Keith Whitley.
[01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:41.698]  You know, I try to be calm.
[01:00:41.698 --> 01:00:44.040]  And then I just look at all this news and I get more and more wound up.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.321]  It's just, it's crazy.
[01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:50.485]  We're having our birthrights stolen right in front of us.
[01:00:50.485 --> 01:00:51.766]  I love this part right here.
[01:00:51.766 --> 01:00:56.889]  You know, Trump's got that truth in his eyes.
[01:00:56.889 --> 01:00:59.231]  It's all about.
[01:01:07.657 --> 01:01:08.798]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:13.342]  They write all these articles demonizing me, lying about me constantly.
[01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:14.302]  But I'll guarantee you this.
[01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:19.066]  I might be wrong sometimes, but I believe in what I'm saying, and I'm committed to this 110%.
[01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.648]  The globalists don't like that.
[01:01:21.648 --> 01:01:23.690]  They don't like commitment.
[01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.771]  They don't like people that stand for things.
[01:01:25.771 --> 01:01:32.737]  So sometimes this broadcast is a train wreck, and just 33 days out from this election, usually I blow up maybe every two weeks on the crew.
[01:01:32.737 --> 01:01:33.798]  I've been doing it almost every day.
[01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:40.019]  Because I'll be at home at 8, 9 at night, and I just want to come back to work and fight.
[01:01:40.019 --> 01:01:48.266]  Because what they're doing to people, and how we're losing our birthright, and how evil these globalists are, at a fundamental level, I want to do something.
[01:01:48.266 --> 01:01:52.129]  And I'm mad at myself that I run out of energy.
[01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:55.012]  I'm mad at myself.
[01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.313]  So I'm not on your butt telling you you need to do more.
[01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.895]  All I'm saying is, my God,
[01:01:59.943 --> 01:02:05.028]  Did our ancestors fight and go through all this hell to build one of the most open, free countries in the world?
[01:02:05.028 --> 01:02:08.651]  They sure tell us it's bad all day because they know it's the model of the future.
[01:02:08.651 --> 01:02:11.133]  Doesn't mean we ever did all the stuff we wanted to do.
[01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:17.279]  Doesn't mean we ever got there, but we sure as hell got further than anybody else!
[01:02:17.279 --> 01:02:23.605]  And now countries and groups that are so damn bloodthirsty, I can't even describe it, are taking over!
[01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:37.264]  And you know, it's a family show, but sometimes I've got a big repertoire and a big semantical lexicon in my psychological concordance and my verbiage.
[01:02:37.264 --> 01:02:42.166]  But I gotta tell you right now, sometimes you gotta use the lower English.
[01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:44.187]  Or the Old English.
[01:02:44.187 --> 01:02:44.887]  Or the Saxon.
[01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:47.937]  Because that's what works, and it's true.
[01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:50.478]  They're pissing in our faces.
[01:02:50.478 --> 01:02:52.880]  They're pissing in our faces!
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.421]  They're pissing in our faces!
[01:02:55.421 --> 01:02:56.482]  They're pissing on us!
[01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:59.818]  And I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.982]  It's not about, oh, I'm this big, high and mighty guy.
[01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:05.204]  You better, you know, you're not going to push me around.
[01:03:05.204 --> 01:03:06.626]  They don't want to just piss on us.
[01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:09.109]  They want to run every damn part of our lives.
[01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:11.852]  And you look at that little hunchback demon.
[01:03:11.852 --> 01:03:17.338]  You look at that little gremlin, Tim Cook, who I'm going to tear into next segment.
[01:03:17.338 --> 01:03:18.940]  And that guy's a piece of crap.
[01:03:19.912 --> 01:03:27.316]  You know, the Chi-Coms don't go around and virtue-signal all day how liberal they are, how much they love poor people or weak people.
[01:03:27.316 --> 01:03:29.036]  They work them to death and kill them.
[01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:30.977]  And it's wrong.
[01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:36.380]  And they execute gays if they get too uppity.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.121]  And I think that's wrong.
[01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:40.002]  But you won't hear a damn word out of a Tim Cook.
[01:03:41.604 --> 01:03:54.426]  Because he is a monster, and he enables monstrous activity, and he cheerleads for it, and pushes it at every level.
[01:03:54.426 --> 01:03:56.066]  And he thinks we're stupid!
[01:03:56.066 --> 01:04:00.007]  And I'm not stupid, you dangerous little monster.
[01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:02.868]  You're an authoritarian dirtbag.
[01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:10.869]  Now that said, that said, he's starting to be more honest.
[01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:19.472]  We're going to show you where he calls for the end of free speech in America, and where he cheerleads it in China, and where he says, I'm ready.
[01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:24.973]  And Apple is ready to tailor your country's oppression to whatever you want.
[01:04:24.973 --> 01:04:29.595]  Oh, Apple's always said we're not custom to individuals.
[01:04:29.595 --> 01:04:30.595]  We're custom to ourselves.
[01:04:32.273 --> 01:04:39.995]  But when it comes to authoritarian regimes, they will tailor make it like a handmade suit from the finest London shop.
[01:04:39.995 --> 01:04:50.399]  He will get it done just right and he'll help arrest your Christians and your Buddhists and he'll help take them from their families and he'll help cut their levers out and sell them.
[01:04:50.399 --> 01:04:53.279]  But it's okay because he's gay and he wears skinny jeans.
[01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.012]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:05:01.012 --> 01:05:07.336]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:09.096]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[01:06:06.268 --> 01:06:10.652]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.652 --> 01:06:16.297]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:31.736 --> 01:06:36.081]  All right, let's get into the facts.
[01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:38.984]  Tim Cook is the most evil man in the world.
[01:06:38.984 --> 01:06:43.429]  He's certainly the most dangerous, and I'm going to show you the proof here right now.
[01:06:43.429 --> 01:06:47.133]  Look at DrugsReport.com.
[01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:49.856]  Right there on screen for you.
[01:06:49.856 --> 01:06:52.459]  Bloomberg Businessweek, the big hack.
[01:06:53.464 --> 01:06:58.526]  How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate America's Top Companies.
[01:06:58.526 --> 01:07:08.350]  I'm going to show you articles from 2009, 2011, 2015, 2016, right through to today, from Infowars.com, saying exactly what Bloomberg's got on the cover of Businessweek and the big news.
[01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:28.019]  Now, why is that important?
[01:07:28.019 --> 01:07:34.863]  Tim Cook had already moved to China five years ago, the CEO of Apple.
[01:07:34.863 --> 01:07:42.907]  But Tim Cook, seven months ago, officially became state-run to get total tax exemption.
[01:07:42.907 --> 01:07:45.208]  Yeah, Trump's bad for lowering it to 15 if you live in the U.S.
[01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:48.570]  China goes to zero to counter that.
[01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:49.551]  When they went to zero,
[01:07:50.899 --> 01:08:00.262]  He said, he was quoted in Reuters saying, when you're in China and you partner, the government runs you!
[01:08:00.262 --> 01:08:01.263]  Now let that sink in.
[01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:03.203]  I'm going to show you the articles where he said it.
[01:08:03.203 --> 01:08:07.845]  If you're a TV viewer, radio listeners, I'll give the headlines.
[01:08:07.845 --> 01:08:10.886]  Now, you think about that.
[01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:15.648]  China has killed five times what Hitler did of its own people.
[01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:24.118]  You don't hear a word, not one Hollywood movie about another, because China owns Hollywood.
[01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:27.201]  Our elites positioned China for the takedown of America.
[01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:28.803]  It's a corporate takeover.
[01:08:28.803 --> 01:08:29.844]  This is high treason.
[01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:31.786]  Trump is trying to stop this.
[01:08:31.786 --> 01:08:35.109]  But Tim Cook goes in there and lies to his face.
[01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.671]  We've got solutions as well.
[01:08:36.671 --> 01:08:41.436]  When I started going after Tim Cook, that's when I got deplatformed, and he bragged that he led it.
[01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:48.994]  But that's why he's now denying, oh, I didn't work with any other companies.
[01:08:48.994 --> 01:08:51.516]  Even though he bragged about it and Apple Insider did.
[01:08:51.516 --> 01:08:56.920]  One hour after he decided, Sunday night, Monday morning, 3 a.m.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.546]  Monday morning, strangest thing is I woke up like 3.15, never do that, got on my phone, Alex Jones banned.
[01:09:03.546 --> 01:09:11.092]  And it said with one hour of Tim Cook in a Sunday night meeting with Zuckerberg and others, they made the decision and followed suit.
[01:09:11.092 --> 01:09:13.034]  But now he says he never did it.
[01:09:13.034 --> 01:09:14.435]  Forget about Alex Jones.
[01:09:18.075 --> 01:09:22.416]  He knows it's racketeering.
[01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:28.058]  He knows that he worked with other companies and that's what's illegal.
[01:09:28.058 --> 01:09:29.718]  That's Sherman Antitrust.
[01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:31.359]  That's a Combine.
[01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.539]  That's a cartel.
[01:09:33.539 --> 01:09:36.780]  That is 100% illegal.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.681]  But see, they thought, oh, we've beat up Alex Jones for years in the press.
[01:09:39.681 --> 01:09:40.501]  We'll ban him.
[01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:41.502]  No one will defend him.
[01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:42.782]  And then the president shat.
[01:09:42.782 --> 01:09:45.943]  And they even brag about that like we can't read.
[01:09:47.236 --> 01:09:51.240]  Like all the men are all watching NFL and women are all getting Botox injections.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.321]  They'll never read it.
[01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:52.962]  Well, guess what?
[01:09:52.962 --> 01:09:55.885]  I am, jerk.
[01:09:55.885 --> 01:09:56.486]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:09:56.486 --> 01:09:58.808]  That's why I've got to be banned.
[01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:04.254]  So, he goes and talks to Vice and talks to the reporter.
[01:10:04.254 --> 01:10:07.177]  I was a little sarcastic yesterday.
[01:10:07.177 --> 01:10:07.758]  I apologize.
[01:10:07.758 --> 01:10:08.759]  I think she's actually pretty lady.
[01:10:11.531 --> 01:10:15.094]  Apple CEO Tim Cook praises China's censored internet.
[01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:16.655]  Remember that headline?
[01:10:16.655 --> 01:10:18.176]  In the Global Times.
[01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:22.239]  Officially run by the Chinese Communist and the Washington Post.
[01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:23.160]  Right here.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.761]  Washington Post.
[01:10:24.761 --> 01:10:27.583]  Chinese media welcomes Cook endorsement.
[01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:31.706]  But the Nationalist Global Times declaring the headline, consensus grows.
[01:10:31.706 --> 01:10:37.411]  And then the Chinese dictator said, I'm glad America's tackling fake news like Alex Jones.
[01:10:39.417 --> 01:10:41.219]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:10:41.219 --> 01:10:45.042]  Oh, the Chinese dictator says, oh, good job!
[01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:52.048]  The Pentagon says, well, that's the Pentagon basically wrote that article.
[01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:54.090]  Says, Special Operations wrote that.
[01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:56.752]  Alex Jones is right, China's a threat, and it may be too late.
[01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:59.295]  He's been censored under Chinese government orders.
[01:10:59.295 --> 01:11:02.537]  Oh, but don't listen to the Pentagon and the Washington Times.
[01:11:02.537 --> 01:11:05.240]  They're not cool like Tim Cook.
[01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:09.020]  People who can't you take get attacked and demonized?
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.662]  Yeah, I'm fighting foreign governments to control our media.
[01:11:11.662 --> 01:11:13.383]  You think I care what they say about me?
[01:11:13.383 --> 01:11:14.444]  I'm in a war!
[01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:17.146]  Grow up, people!
[01:11:17.146 --> 01:11:19.848]  We're not here trying to win popularity contests.
[01:11:19.848 --> 01:11:21.509]  We're trying to beat the globalists.
[01:11:21.509 --> 01:11:27.154]  I don't have to drag guns 50-something miles through the snow with no shoes with a trail of blood like Ticonderoga.
[01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:31.157]  I can at least stand up and get lied about in the media to tell the truth and stop these people.
[01:11:34.369 --> 01:11:37.891]  China's got radio stations and TV stations beaming propaganda.
[01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:40.333]  They've got full-page, four-page ads against Trump.
[01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:43.395]  Can you imagine if the Russians did that?
[01:11:43.395 --> 01:11:46.176]  I'd say, arrest them!
[01:11:46.176 --> 01:11:47.617]  Oh, but the Chinese.
[01:11:47.617 --> 01:11:52.180]  No, they're... they have yellow skin, so it's okay.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.501]  And Tim Cook's gay.
[01:11:53.501 --> 01:11:56.162]  He's gay, they're Asian, it's alright.
[01:11:56.162 --> 01:11:57.043]  Oh, well if you say that.
[01:11:57.043 --> 01:11:59.485]  They're killing Buddhists that happen to be yellow-skinned, too.
[01:11:59.485 --> 01:12:00.885]  Well, that's alright.
[01:12:00.885 --> 01:12:03.287]  Because, you know, they're... you know, China did it.
[01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:05.735]  I'm dead and gone.
[01:12:06.428 --> 01:12:20.379]  You know, the worst thing about Tim Cook is his company pays zero tax, then he lobbies all day to have higher taxes than the middle class, because he wants control, and then he, again, runs around, I'm gay, I'm gay, you can't disagree with me, and meanwhile he doesn't care if China kills gays, and it gets even worse.
[01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:30.446]  He has the worst factories where they contract, even the Chinese communists say, in the news, two weeks ago, share the wealth, you pay people two dollars a day, they're working to death, why?
[01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:34.450]  Spend some money with them so we can build something, and Cook goes, no!
[01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.991]  Nothing for you, I'm liberal!
[01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:37.012]  Nothing!
[01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:38.914]  Ha ha ha, liberal!
[01:12:38.914 --> 01:12:41.237]  Ha ha ha, liberal!
[01:12:41.237 --> 01:12:44.040]  And the left just goes, he's gay, death camp!
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.242]  Kill the Christians, death camp!
[01:12:45.242 --> 01:12:46.563]  He's gay, it's okay!
[01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:46.703]  So...
[01:12:47.762 --> 01:12:48.842]  It's trendy, it's funny.
[01:12:48.842 --> 01:12:52.544]  He wears a little, you know, tight shirts, a little, he walks around like he's God.
[01:12:52.544 --> 01:12:53.644]  Oh, liberal, liberal!
[01:12:53.644 --> 01:12:55.045]  That's why he's so evil.
[01:12:55.045 --> 01:12:56.385]  That's why he's so dangerous.
[01:12:56.385 --> 01:12:57.286]  That's why he's so bad.
[01:12:57.286 --> 01:13:02.708]  Because you think of like a bad guy as Hitler or Stalin or Mao in a uniform and tanks and death.
[01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:03.488]  But no!
[01:13:03.488 --> 01:13:08.610]  It's all tech spying on you, tracking you, controlling you.
[01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:13.772]  And so here he is, Apple CEO Tim Cook praises China's internet censorship in the Washington Post.
[01:13:14.906 --> 01:13:15.807]  There's another one.
[01:13:15.807 --> 01:13:20.554]  Tim Cook says Apple had to comply with Chinese censors, and they did do it!
[01:13:20.554 --> 01:13:21.655]  And they'll do it in the U.S.
[01:13:21.655 --> 01:13:22.717]  too!
[01:13:22.717 --> 01:13:25.360]  And the liberal publicans are like, oh, awesome!
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.181]  So cool!
[01:13:26.181 --> 01:13:26.942]  That's last year!
[01:13:29.073 --> 01:13:33.336]  They shut down all the VPNs and helped arrest over 100,000 people.
[01:13:33.336 --> 01:13:34.296]  That's good!
[01:13:34.296 --> 01:13:39.419]  They even gave them the locations, and they even helped with their new apps tracking people in China.
[01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:40.460]  It's good!
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.622]  And he said he'll do it here, and he helped lead taking InfoWars off.
[01:13:44.622 --> 01:13:46.704]  Oh, and now it's Breitbart being taken out of work.
[01:13:46.704 --> 01:13:48.205]  Oh my God, isn't that funny?
[01:13:48.205 --> 01:13:52.347]  The president's mouthpiece from the campaign being taken down now.
[01:13:52.347 --> 01:13:53.488]  Oh, there's not a problem, though.
[01:13:53.488 --> 01:13:55.849]  Nothing wrong.
[01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.571]  Just let Tim Cook do whatever he'll go to the White House, and, you know, maybe
[01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:04.625]  You know, offer the president, you know, a little, you know what, it'll be okay.
[01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:09.188]  Tim Cook says, I mean, I'm sure he'll offer it, the president won't accept it.
[01:14:09.188 --> 01:14:14.653]  Apple CEO backs China's vision of an open internet as censorship reaches new heights.
[01:14:14.653 --> 01:14:15.794]  I love this!
[01:14:15.794 --> 01:14:21.098]  They call it open internet censorship, but Tim Cook says it's a worldwide censorship, see?
[01:14:21.098 --> 01:14:23.200]  That, but open means they run it all.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.584]  They curate it all, like a professor, a curator at a museum.
[01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:30.390]  Brushes off Senators' taunts.
[01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:33.172]  Activists who stand up and say, how dare you help round us up and kill us?
[01:14:33.172 --> 01:14:35.834]  He just laughs at them, laughs at the Senators.
[01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:38.236]  Google won't even show up with congressional testimonies.
[01:14:38.236 --> 01:14:39.637]  It's all so funny.
[01:14:41.055 --> 01:14:42.996]  He says China's the future, not America.
[01:14:42.996 --> 01:14:44.037]  There's another article.
[01:14:44.037 --> 01:14:46.578]  Virtual private networks all shut down.
[01:14:46.578 --> 01:14:50.780]  For the first time, China will host Apple iCloud keys overseas.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.161]  That means your Apple ID over there.
[01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:56.523]  Apple to start putting sensitive encryption keys in China, because they've officially moved there.
[01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:58.084]  Apple's Tim Cook.
[01:14:58.084 --> 01:15:00.885]  Chinese spy chips are found in hardware used by Apple.
[01:15:00.885 --> 01:15:04.707]  Amazon Bloomberg says to break into the military, our government, steal everything.
[01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:05.988]  And Apple helped them do it.
[01:15:05.988 --> 01:15:08.569]  Apple's the main group.
[01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:13.450]  They scan the Samsung chips, they scan the U.S.
[01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.231]  chips, they don't have the spy chips.
[01:15:15.231 --> 01:15:19.673]  But China does, but it's okay because they're Asian and he's gay.
[01:15:19.673 --> 01:15:21.494]  It's okay if they kill dissidents.
[01:15:21.494 --> 01:15:31.498]  It's okay if they spy on you with chips that they may even pay for in the chip in your house and steal all your data and work with Google and their mobile cars that come by and scoop it up and give it to Tim Cook and their alliance.
[01:15:31.498 --> 01:15:39.402]  It's okay if China works with Google to help censor their own public and round them up because Google's liberal and Tim Cook's gay!
[01:15:40.462 --> 01:15:42.323]  Again, as long as you're gay, it's alright.
[01:15:42.323 --> 01:15:44.064]  See how that works?
[01:15:44.064 --> 01:15:45.725]  It's liberal.
[01:15:45.725 --> 01:15:49.866]  So, we've got more here, but, you know, the Chinese-made kitchen appliance is spying on you.
[01:15:49.866 --> 01:15:52.888]  That's Associated Press, but it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay!
[01:15:57.788 --> 01:15:58.989]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:04.372]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.372 --> 01:16:07.273]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.273 --> 01:16:10.855]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.855 --> 01:16:18.419]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:16:27.441 --> 01:16:28.342]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:17:27.478 --> 01:17:28.698]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.698 --> 01:17:32.619]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.619 --> 01:17:34.159]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:34.159 --> 01:17:37.120]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:42.681]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:43.881]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:46.821]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:49.042]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:49.042 --> 01:17:53.482]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:55.823]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:02.112]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:04.713]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.594]  No one else has this from deep earth.
[01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:08.635]  Crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:10.116]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:18:10.116 --> 01:18:11.977]  It's the good halogen.
[01:18:11.977 --> 01:18:14.138]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:18:14.138 --> 01:18:20.681]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:18:20.681 --> 01:18:23.283]  Bio-Truth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:18:23.283 --> 01:18:24.684]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:18:26.004 --> 01:18:31.708]  It's seen as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.509]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:35.070]  We have a combo of those.
[01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:36.451]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:18:36.451 --> 01:18:39.192]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:40.233]  Very simple stuff.
[01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:41.854]  Filter your water.
[01:18:41.854 --> 01:18:43.935]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:18:43.935 --> 01:18:45.396]  Best out there for the price.
[01:18:45.396 --> 01:18:46.477]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:18:47.734 --> 01:18:49.216]  I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[01:18:49.216 --> 01:18:50.116]  I hope we get more.
[01:18:50.116 --> 01:18:51.418]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:52.299]  Survival Store next to it.
[01:18:52.299 --> 01:18:55.522]  InfowarsStore.com or InfowarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:03.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.313 --> 01:20:39.016]  Until just a few years ago, Apple, Google, Facebook would not operate in China because China wanted control over their hardware, over their software, over their users' data.
[01:20:39.016 --> 01:20:45.698]  But Apple and others, enticed to get 0% tax, this year, 2018, have officially moved to China.
[01:20:47.654 --> 01:20:54.036]  And just three months ago, Google told the Pentagon, we're not going to work with you on AI or anything else.
[01:20:54.036 --> 01:20:56.177]  We think America's bad.
[01:20:56.177 --> 01:20:57.397]  That's right.
[01:20:57.397 --> 01:21:03.739]  But oh, the virtue signaling San Francisco elite, China, that again has killed five times what Hitler did.
[01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:05.079]  They're good.
[01:21:05.079 --> 01:21:07.880]  And I told you that I was told by sources inside Google.
[01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:14.930]  That Facebook was going to work with them on the AI and deploy a Chinese social score.
[01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:18.191]  You can actually look it up, where Zuckerberg met a year ago with them and talked about it.
[01:21:18.191 --> 01:21:21.211]  You can also pull up Tim Cook with the Communist Chinese leaders.
[01:21:21.211 --> 01:21:24.472]  And now, this just broke.
[01:21:24.472 --> 01:21:29.273]  Google and Facebook join forces on AI tech.
[01:21:29.273 --> 01:21:37.635]  Tech giant Google and social media giant Facebook were reportedly teaming up, French news agency, to develop a new artificial intelligence technology in China!
[01:21:37.635 --> 01:21:38.155]  Of course!
[01:21:39.704 --> 01:21:50.431]  But don't worry, Trump's family did standard asset protection and estate planning that everybody else does that's wealthy, so that's the big news.
[01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:58.315]  It was 500-something million dollars when his dad died that was given to the children, some included Trump, so that's dirty and bad, so my God, it's terrible.
[01:21:58.315 --> 01:22:07.281]  There's no slave factories, there's no helping round up political dissidents, there's no censorship search engines, there's no banning people's speech in America, but it doesn't matter.
[01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:26.769]  So, Apple's CEO Tim Cook praises China's censorship of the internet and says he wants to do it here, and then goes on vice, and amongst other things says, oh I don't want power, I don't have any power, I'm just a little trendy.
[01:22:26.769 --> 01:22:28.370]  They're camouflaging themselves.
[01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:33.333]  Apple's all about dominance of the internet, all about corporate power, all about control.
[01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:36.676]  Then he goes on, Tim Cook, to say, oh he was curating
[01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:52.734]  Like a person in a museum, not cauterizing, burning out our First Amendment, but curating when we just disappear, or he helps political dissidents be arrested, or, you know, has the worst slave factories in China on record.
[01:22:52.734 --> 01:23:03.196]  They contract out the lowest wages, the social control, forced drugging of the employees, forced abortion, suicide nets, things you can't even imagine in a science fiction dystopia novel.
[01:23:04.551 --> 01:23:13.916]  But it's all done, but it's Tim Cook, and the liberal media loves him, and he wears little skin-tight shirts, and talks about Steve Jobs all day, and how fun it is.
[01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:16.338]  It is the poison apple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:16.338 --> 01:23:17.418]  It's in your face.
[01:23:17.418 --> 01:23:25.683]  So here is a clip of him saying, oh, we didn't coordinate, even though Apple Insider said that they coordinated.
[01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:28.805]  And he bragged that they coordinated, but now because of the racketeering.
[01:23:31.912 --> 01:23:40.041]  Now because of the collusion, now because of the cartel behavior, they're concerned ahead of Trump taking action.
[01:23:40.041 --> 01:23:40.422]  Here it is.
[01:23:41.764 --> 01:23:44.265]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[01:23:44.265 --> 01:23:49.566]  What users want from us, and what we've always provided them, is a curated platform.
[01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.407]  We don't take a political stand.
[01:23:51.407 --> 01:23:53.747]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[01:23:53.747 --> 01:23:58.949]  You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts, etc.
[01:23:58.949 --> 01:24:02.450]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:06.406]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[01:24:06.406 --> 01:24:19.773]  You know, we get into a singular kind of event, but I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[01:24:19.773 --> 01:24:23.034]  Did you coordinate with other tech companies to kick off Alex Jones?
[01:24:23.034 --> 01:24:23.995]  No.
[01:24:23.995 --> 01:24:28.157]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[01:24:28.157 --> 01:24:28.337]  Why not?
[01:24:28.337 --> 01:24:31.819]  We make our decisions independently, and I think that's important.
[01:24:33.891 --> 01:24:35.272]  That was a load of horse manure.
[01:24:35.272 --> 01:24:38.716]  We're going to come back with Millie Weaver in the next segment.
[01:24:38.716 --> 01:24:39.837]  They're on record.
[01:24:39.837 --> 01:24:41.018]  They're on record censoring.
[01:24:41.018 --> 01:24:42.219]  They're on record spying.
[01:24:42.219 --> 01:24:45.142]  They're all on record, the tech giants, lying about it.
[01:24:45.142 --> 01:24:46.123]  Look back in hindsight.
[01:24:51.274 --> 01:24:54.876]  I think there's enough there that we had to curate.
[01:24:54.876 --> 01:24:56.657]  You know, Hitler saw himself as a curator.
[01:24:56.657 --> 01:25:01.920]  He wanted Berlin to be this big museum city with these big massive structures.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:10.425]  And then they called Albert Speer, his head of domestic operations, the curator and the master architect.
[01:25:10.425 --> 01:25:15.168]  And so when you hear stuff like, oh, we're curating, we're ordering your life because we know best, wow!
[01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:23.031]  Oh, but there's enough there, like slave factories in China, like aiding China in spying on its political dissidents, like being tax-exempt.
[01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:29.758]  Oh my God, Trump avoided taxes with his father, legally and lawfully, but Tim Cook goes over there and doesn't pay any tax.
[01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.980]  And that's like, oh, but it's alright, he's gay.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.884]  So it's okay if they kill gays in China, because he's gay.
[01:25:36.884 --> 01:25:38.446]  Oh my God, then it's okay.
[01:25:39.991 --> 01:25:41.192]  He actually looks like a buzzard.
[01:25:41.192 --> 01:25:45.455]  He ought to be sitting up in a tree over some dead rotting flesh he's going to enjoy.
[01:25:45.455 --> 01:25:47.116]  But I'm not going to get into the way Tim Cook looks.
[01:25:47.116 --> 01:25:48.397]  By the way, why were his eyes so big?
[01:25:48.397 --> 01:25:53.201]  We can do a whole other video on only what, LSD does that?
[01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:55.042]  Methamphetamine does that?
[01:25:55.042 --> 01:25:56.684]  Can we go back to his eyes?
[01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:59.986]  Everybody pointed out, even on YouTube, they're like, what's up with that dude's eyes?
[01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:06.051]  Imagine if I was on TV and my pupils were like 90% like I was an owl.
[01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:06.991]  There's a straight on shot.
[01:26:06.991 --> 01:26:07.772]  Go to the straight on shot.
[01:26:09.813 --> 01:26:12.014]  I mean, whoa, dude!
[01:26:12.014 --> 01:26:14.655]  You've got like 90% pupil.
[01:26:14.655 --> 01:26:15.236]  Whoa!
[01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.297]  What's going on there, bro?
[01:26:18.297 --> 01:26:20.098]  What you taking?
[01:26:20.098 --> 01:26:22.479]  Must be some pretty good stuff.
[01:26:22.479 --> 01:26:32.544]  Last time I ever saw pupils that big, the police were arresting one of my neighbors in high school because he took too many hits LSD.
[01:26:32.544 --> 01:26:38.627]  Last time I saw that brother, he's in television lights in Grand Central Station.
[01:26:39.605 --> 01:26:41.706]  With lights blasting in his face.
[01:26:41.706 --> 01:26:45.489]  Boy, if a cop pulled him over, he'd say, son!
[01:26:45.489 --> 01:26:46.490]  You micro-dosing?
[01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.372]  By the way, a micro-dose of LSD doesn't do that.
[01:26:49.372 --> 01:26:50.553]  That is a what?
[01:26:50.553 --> 01:26:51.233]  What?
[01:26:51.233 --> 01:26:53.515]  Three grams of mushrooms?
[01:26:53.515 --> 01:26:56.737]  Two hits of LSD-25 will do that, when you're peaking.
[01:26:58.317 --> 01:26:59.958]  It must be good, whatever that stuff is.
[01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:00.579]  Thank God, boy.
[01:27:00.579 --> 01:27:02.901]  He ain't worried about no slave factories.
[01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:05.203]  In fact, he said we ought to be doing that here.
[01:27:05.203 --> 01:27:09.046]  He said, he goes, I'll follow orders from China, and I'm ready in any other country.
[01:27:09.046 --> 01:27:12.809]  You let us in, baby, we'll put our legs behind our ears.
[01:27:12.809 --> 01:27:16.111]  And we say, we'll do what you, and that means your user does that.
[01:27:16.111 --> 01:27:19.474]  Oh, but they're just a private company, so it's okay.
[01:27:19.474 --> 01:27:26.520]  Oh, by the way, our app was five stars, millions of downloads, number one in news, number three total apps, and they deleted it.
[01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:30.252]  Now it's on Google Play, number one in news.
[01:27:30.252 --> 01:27:31.412]  Oh, he curated!
[01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:51.766]  Oh, that'd be like you're a movie theater owner, and the movie that's got a line around the block, you go, oh, we're pulling that movie, but the movie nobody wants to watch, you know, your Chinese communist thing with a, you know, weird little vulture-like demon hopping around, and, you know, you want to curate us and teach us all about SJW crap and teach us how to hate America, and nobody wants to drink your Kool-Aid, so you just say, you know what?
[01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.848]  I think I'm gonna take my ball and go home.
[01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.333]  Because I'm Tim Cook, and I'm on some hard drugs.
[01:27:58.333 --> 01:28:00.494]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:00.494 --> 01:28:02.156]  Tim Cook is on designer drugs.
[01:28:02.156 --> 01:28:03.717]  And what have I told you about Silicon Valley?
[01:28:03.717 --> 01:28:07.020]  They're the next civilization, and it ain't good.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:13.164]  I know some of the highest level people, let's just say right below the highest level, they said, Alex, you don't understand.
[01:28:13.164 --> 01:28:16.227]  It's nothing but sex and drugs and insanity.
[01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:24.232]  And there's Tim Cook in television camera light blasting his face.
[01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:34.877]  In any state police school they tell you that man is on two or three rails of methamphetamine or he's on at least a large dose of psilocybin mushrooms or LSD.
[01:28:36.837 --> 01:28:38.057]  That's it.
[01:28:38.057 --> 01:28:39.718]  That's the only drugs that do it.
[01:28:39.718 --> 01:28:41.879]  What drugs is Tim Cook on?
[01:28:41.879 --> 01:28:48.542]  And how soon till he gets his ass arrested for helping China at those factories built in spy chips to infiltrate America?
[01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:50.963]  Son, you're on some hard-ass drugs.
[01:28:50.963 --> 01:28:54.324]  You think America's gonna bend over to your commie crap, you little bastard?
[01:28:57.654 --> 01:28:58.874]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.874 --> 01:29:04.256]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:07.158]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.158 --> 01:29:10.739]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:12.574]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[01:33:19.577 --> 01:33:24.460]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.921]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.866 --> 01:33:33.148]  I don't like the fact that he is putting kids in cage.
[01:33:33.148 --> 01:33:35.230]  That's not, that's not, that's inhumane.
[01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:37.031]  If you ask me, it's not right.
[01:33:37.031 --> 01:33:38.613]  I don't like the fact that he's separating families.
[01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.335]  I don't think you would have liked to be separated whenever you were younger.
[01:33:41.335 --> 01:33:42.336]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:33:42.336 --> 01:33:43.737]  And I have a strong bond with my mom.
[01:33:43.737 --> 01:33:46.459]  I would have never pictured myself being separated by my mom.
[01:33:46.459 --> 01:33:50.963]  I would have never, I know, you know, I know the feeling that the kids have.
[01:33:50.963 --> 01:33:51.863]  And it's sad.
[01:33:51.863 --> 01:33:54.405]  Every time I watch the news, there's even more kids being caged up.
[01:33:54.405 --> 01:33:55.747]  That's not right.
[01:33:55.747 --> 01:33:57.368]  Dogs are caged up, not humans.
[01:33:57.608 --> 01:34:02.912]  So are you talking about the issue of people being deported that are here illegally?
[01:34:02.912 --> 01:34:05.114]  No, I'm not saying that, and I'm not saying that.
[01:34:05.114 --> 01:34:09.698]  I'm just saying that he shouldn't cage up kids who have families who support them and love them.
[01:34:09.698 --> 01:34:10.358]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:10.358 --> 01:34:14.442]  I don't think it's right for him to be separating children at such a young age.
[01:34:14.442 --> 01:34:23.369]  So are you talking about the issue where you had all the Times and a bunch of these articles talking about how kids were being separated from their family at the border?
[01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:25.170]  Yeah, I think that's really inhumane.
[01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:26.411]  I don't think it's right.
[01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:39.321]  Did you hear about how the little girl who was pictured on Time Magazine crying, that her parents came out and said that that was fake because they were with her the whole time and she was just kind of having a little temper tantrum?
[01:34:39.321 --> 01:34:45.666]  And they took that picture and they lied and said that she was a child that was being taken from her family when she never was.
[01:34:45.666 --> 01:34:46.427]  Did you hear about that?
[01:34:46.687 --> 01:34:47.647]  Alright, that's one, right?
[01:34:47.647 --> 01:34:47.988]  That's one.
[01:34:47.988 --> 01:34:49.488]  That's one person who lied.
[01:34:49.488 --> 01:34:50.989]  That's one person who lied.
[01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.269]  Hit pause real quick.
[01:34:52.269 --> 01:35:03.313]  We're going to go to Millie Weaver in a little bit in the next hour and then Greg Reese is going to be joining us with amazing investigative PC Dibb, the leader of the main Iranian opposition group that really needs to be heard out.
[01:35:03.313 --> 01:35:08.335]  This is important information that the leftist media doesn't want you to see.
[01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:15.838]  But notice, if you're a radio listener, these young people, these teenagers, they look like about 20 or so, so young adults.
[01:35:17.714 --> 01:35:21.716]  They're wearing Mexico outfits.
[01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:25.317]  They're wearing red, green, and white outfits.
[01:35:25.317 --> 01:35:27.838]  They go into how they love Mexico.
[01:35:27.838 --> 01:35:32.420]  And I would have said, you know, 200,000 people have gotten killed in Mexico the last few years.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:33.680]  Everyone's fleeing up here.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.262]  These are mothers bringing their kids, in some cases, unaccompanied through war zones.
[01:35:38.262 --> 01:35:42.944]  How the hell are we bad for trying to vet who's who?
[01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:45.445]  But it's this entitlement.
[01:35:45.445 --> 01:35:52.147]  It's like you call Kavanaugh a sex assaulter and then they scream at other senators and say, you're a rapist!
[01:35:52.147 --> 01:35:55.567]  So you take one unproven thing and add it to another and another.
[01:35:55.567 --> 01:35:57.068]  It's just hysteria.
[01:35:57.068 --> 01:36:01.969]  And then a father comes over who lost his daughter to an illegal alien drunk driver and they get in his face.
[01:36:01.969 --> 01:36:06.870]  And we've got other videos we haven't aired yet with Millie coming up when she goes to these events in Tennessee and other states.
[01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:08.270]  They're on Infowars.com every day.
[01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:12.914]  Millie and Gavin Wentz, her husband, are on fire, and they've got another crew member with them.
[01:36:12.914 --> 01:36:22.282]  And this is what your support of InfoWars allows us to finance, is getting reporters at these events like what Millie and people like Will Johnson and others are out there doing.
[01:36:22.282 --> 01:36:23.823]  So, just think about that, folks.
[01:36:23.823 --> 01:36:25.304]  Let's go ahead and finish up this clip.
[01:36:25.304 --> 01:36:27.446]  That's not all of them.
[01:36:27.446 --> 01:36:28.927]  That's not all of them.
[01:36:28.927 --> 01:36:29.908]  You can get out of here.
[01:36:29.908 --> 01:36:30.809]  You can get out of here.
[01:36:30.809 --> 01:36:31.730]  You can get out of here.
[01:36:33.156 --> 01:36:37.978]  So I'm going to be in your country, I'm going to get everything free, but you come over and say my daughter got killed by an illegal alien.
[01:36:37.978 --> 01:36:39.358]  You get out of here!
[01:36:39.358 --> 01:36:40.039]  You get out of here!
[01:36:40.039 --> 01:36:41.539]  It's what the illegal aliens walk up to me and say.
[01:36:41.539 --> 01:36:43.760]  You go back to Europe, pilgrim!
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.721]  Your mama married her brother, and I go, how dare you racist?
[01:36:46.721 --> 01:36:47.462]  The National News.
[01:36:47.462 --> 01:36:53.324]  Jones is racist to poor Hispanic woman, and then edits out her calling me a monkey and my parents inbred hillbillies.
[01:36:53.324 --> 01:36:53.624]  And again...
[01:36:54.264 --> 01:36:57.928]  If I saw a bunch of white trash saying stuff like this, I'd be mad at them.
[01:36:57.928 --> 01:37:06.196]  But they're telling Hispanics, you can go out and act like the worst people on earth, and be all entitled, and it's just a bunch of young punks.
[01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:06.557]  Continue.
[01:37:07.979 --> 01:37:09.000]  You're in my space.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.101]  Can I say something?
[01:37:10.101 --> 01:37:10.221]  Yeah.
[01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:13.464]  If you guys don't care, I'm an immigrant.
[01:37:13.464 --> 01:37:14.785]  I'm from Argentina.
[01:37:14.785 --> 01:37:17.167]  I can hear the right way.
[01:37:17.167 --> 01:37:18.808]  You have to understand that.
[01:37:18.808 --> 01:37:19.349]  Go to jail.
[01:37:19.349 --> 01:37:20.189]  Wow, wow, wow.
[01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:21.611]  Hey, come.
[01:37:21.611 --> 01:37:23.953]  Blank it out, YouTube.
[01:37:23.953 --> 01:37:25.934]  Blank it out.
[01:37:25.934 --> 01:37:26.835]  Why were you?
[01:37:26.835 --> 01:37:29.237]  Because they're down in America.
[01:37:29.237 --> 01:37:29.978]  Okay.
[01:37:29.978 --> 01:37:31.419]  Look what one of them did to my daughter.
[01:37:31.419 --> 01:37:32.240]  So what happened?
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.381]  Can you tell us about what happened?
[01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:34.822]  Yeah, this is for the UI in Jonesboro.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.203]  An illegal hit her head on doing over 100 mile an hour and had three of his kids in his car.
[01:37:41.203 --> 01:37:45.447]  And when my grandson was with my daughter, my daughter died.
[01:37:45.447 --> 01:37:47.769]  I don't never get to see my daughter again.
[01:37:47.769 --> 01:37:48.689]  He left the country.
[01:37:48.689 --> 01:37:50.070]  It's sorry.
[01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:54.594]  Sheriff we got let him walk right out of the hospital right out of the county and he's gone.
[01:37:54.594 --> 01:37:55.675]  He's in Mexico.
[01:37:55.675 --> 01:37:57.236]  Our country is so sorry.
[01:37:57.236 --> 01:38:00.579]  They won't go to Mexico and get nobody but they allowed to come here.
[01:38:01.696 --> 01:38:06.678]  So you're really upset because you lost your daughter to the illegal immigration issue?
[01:38:06.678 --> 01:38:07.358]  How would you feel?
[01:38:07.358 --> 01:38:08.899]  On his fourth DUI.
[01:38:08.899 --> 01:38:11.619]  He was on probation for his third DUI.
[01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:13.220]  How would you feel?
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.400]  Is this your grandbaby?
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.301]  This is one of them.
[01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:16.881]  Yeah, I got seven of them.
[01:38:16.881 --> 01:38:18.022]  Wow.
[01:38:18.022 --> 01:38:19.362]  Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
[01:38:19.362 --> 01:38:20.062]  That's horrible.
[01:38:20.062 --> 01:38:21.563]  That's horrible.
[01:38:21.563 --> 01:38:24.604]  Well, there ain't nothing that nobody can say to make me feel any better.
[01:38:26.075 --> 01:38:32.860]  Really, we were joined as we got several new clips with people saying, we're here, Mexico first, we're Mexicans, and we're taking over.
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.782]  Again, with Mexican flags draped on them.
[01:38:34.782 --> 01:38:45.691]  I'm like, listen, nothing against Mexico, but good almighty, you want to come here because it's America, but then say it's Mexico, and then just strut around like you're all proud of it.
[01:38:46.713 --> 01:38:47.735]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:38:47.735 --> 01:38:50.098]  Millie, tell folks where you've been traveling around the country.
[01:38:50.098 --> 01:38:51.460]  These are incredible videos every day.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.947]  I mean, just this weekend you were at Kent State where the Antifa was attacking you and the police.
[01:38:55.947 --> 01:38:57.009]  It's just wild out there.
[01:38:58.294 --> 01:38:59.695]  Yeah, it's definitely wild.
[01:38:59.695 --> 01:39:06.100]  Tensions are heating up in America right now as midterms approach and with this whole Kavanaugh hearing that's been happening.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:10.543]  But we were down in Johnson City, Tennessee at a Donald Trump rally.
[01:39:10.543 --> 01:39:22.952]  And what I will say, Alex, is that although this group of Hispanic protesters were being disrespectful, many of them were saying, you know, F Trump and disrespectful things at this rally.
[01:39:24.526 --> 01:39:31.531]  Overall, I've seen just as many, if not way more, white liberals act just as disrespectful and belligerent.
[01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:32.472]  No, I know, but here's the deal.
[01:39:32.472 --> 01:39:33.993]  I'm not saying you're virtue signaling.
[01:39:33.993 --> 01:39:35.934]  We're obviously saying all the Mexicans aren't like this.
[01:39:35.934 --> 01:39:39.917]  We ran a lot of Hispanic folks that were big Trump supporters and were first-time voters.
[01:39:39.917 --> 01:39:40.777]  Very exciting.
[01:39:40.777 --> 01:39:42.478]  We point out dumbass KKK people.
[01:39:42.478 --> 01:39:45.841]  We point out dumbass Mecha people like these folks.
[01:39:45.841 --> 01:39:53.406]  And we've got those positive videos posted on the site, but also, yeah, the average white liberal running up saying, F you racist, the videos are there.
[01:39:54.465 --> 01:39:59.110]  Yeah, and there were actually a lot of Hispanic Trump supporters at the rally as well.
[01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:06.597]  So what this depicted essentially was we had this girl who is, you know, her parents, her families are illegal.
[01:40:06.597 --> 01:40:10.721]  And she's essentially giving this fake news sob story about the children.
[01:40:10.721 --> 01:40:14.224]  She's a pissed off anchor baby coming here, getting everything free, wasn't enough.
[01:40:14.224 --> 01:40:15.846]  She's running around wearing a Mexican flag.
[01:40:15.846 --> 01:40:18.108]  She's a pissed off, spoiled, rotten anchor baby.
[01:40:19.099 --> 01:40:29.207]  She's touting the fake news that the liberal mainstream media has been saying about children being put in cages down on the border and this is all Trump and it's all so horrible.
[01:40:29.207 --> 01:40:34.351]  Greatly over-exaggerated and not really a clear depiction of what's going down at the border.
[01:40:34.351 --> 01:40:39.375]  Sure, she's a moronic anchor baby with these idiots flipping you off in the background.
[01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:40.776]  So let's get to the next clip.
[01:40:40.776 --> 01:40:46.100]  Tell us about the next group we're going to play off the break, running around saying Mexico first, make Mexico great.
[01:40:47.216 --> 01:40:48.637]  Well, rightfully so.
[01:40:48.637 --> 01:40:53.861]  This father overheard the girl complaining about parents not being able to have their children anymore.
[01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:57.183]  So he's like, hey, I don't get to see my daughter anymore.
[01:40:57.183 --> 01:41:03.327]  My daughter's dead because an illegal immigrant was able to keep coming back into the country, had over three DUIs.
[01:41:03.327 --> 01:41:05.829]  Then his fourth DUI kills his daughter.
[01:41:05.829 --> 01:41:07.710]  So he's just grieving and upset.
[01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:22.714]  Then, shortly after, another group of Hispanic protesters actually interrupted the rally and started chanting F Trump and Viva La Raza in Mexico, and they actually had a Mexican flag, and I caught them as they were leaving.
[01:41:22.714 --> 01:41:32.456]  Police had kind of escorted them away from where the speech was going on, and I decided to interview them as to why they were waving a Mexico flag in America.
[01:41:33.156 --> 01:41:39.043]  And essentially what they say is when I ask them, do you believe in America first or Mexico first?
[01:41:39.043 --> 01:41:40.505]  They say Mexico first.
[01:41:40.505 --> 01:41:43.788]  We're going to play that when we come back.
[01:41:43.788 --> 01:41:44.569]  But Millie.
[01:41:46.187 --> 01:41:57.075]  I can't imagine going to Mexico and seeing somebody that says my daughter's killed by illegals and running up going, shut up, and then running around waving Mexican flags and saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:57.075 --> 01:41:58.716]  Then why aren't you in Mexico?
[01:41:58.716 --> 01:42:00.317]  I just don't understand it.
[01:42:00.317 --> 01:42:04.380]  I can't imagine the entitlement that the left has created in people.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:05.101]  This is a joke!
[01:42:06.607 --> 01:42:11.551]  And she was screaming in this man's face while he had his grandbaby on his shoulders.
[01:42:11.551 --> 01:42:25.503]  And if you notice, when I interviewed the man, the grandbaby had tears in her eyes and she was emotionally distraught because the woman came up screaming and cussing this man out, getting in his face, and I believe that it scared the child.
[01:42:25.503 --> 01:42:27.784]  Well, the baby's white, it deserves it.
[01:42:27.784 --> 01:42:31.808]  And that guy from Argentina too, he's bad because he believes he should have borders.
[01:42:32.645 --> 01:42:40.271]  Meanwhile, she's so concerned about children and their welfare, but then she's going to go scream in a man's face while he has his toddler granddaughter on his shoulders.
[01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:40.711]  That's right.
[01:42:40.711 --> 01:42:41.111]  Stay there.
[01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:43.133]  We're going to come back with the next video with Millie Weaver.
[01:42:43.133 --> 01:42:46.295]  And don't forget, folks, Texas is the reason the president's dead.
[01:42:46.295 --> 01:42:48.557]  Texas is the reason the globals are about to go down.
[01:42:57.253 --> 01:42:57.273]  X2.
[01:43:27.854 --> 01:43:30.275]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[01:43:30.275 --> 01:43:31.976]  Ordered it six months ago.
[01:43:31.976 --> 01:43:32.997]  So I get the price down.
[01:43:32.997 --> 01:43:34.738]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:43:34.738 --> 01:43:35.979]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:35.979 --> 01:43:37.940]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:40.322]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:43:40.322 --> 01:43:41.783]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:43:41.783 --> 01:43:44.144]  I'm sure it's viable still next two.
[01:43:44.144 --> 01:43:45.505]  And we've got a good supply.
[01:43:45.505 --> 01:43:46.546]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[01:43:47.327 --> 01:43:51.632]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:10.905]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:44:10.905 --> 01:44:12.906]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:44:12.906 --> 01:44:16.347]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:44:16.347 --> 01:44:18.968]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:44:18.968 --> 01:44:21.269]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:44:21.269 --> 01:44:28.212]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:44:28.772 --> 01:44:38.537]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:44:38.537 --> 01:44:39.738]  We'll win.

[01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:53.485]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.

[01:46:51.943 --> 01:47:03.850]  From InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:45.988 --> 01:47:49.450]  Now, Millie will break down where this rally was.
[01:47:49.450 --> 01:47:50.910]  She's been to a few of them.
[01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:54.872]  This is anti-Trump protesters declare Mexico first.
[01:47:54.872 --> 01:47:59.354]  A different group of folks with Mexican flags in Mexico outfits.
[01:47:59.354 --> 01:48:02.615]  And again, this shows the issue of globalism.
[01:48:02.615 --> 01:48:08.098]  These are people in the country saying we love Mexico, down with Trump.
[01:48:08.098 --> 01:48:09.238]  It's just insane.
[01:48:09.238 --> 01:48:12.920]  No one would do this anywhere else in the world.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.161]  Unless maybe your country was way superior.
[01:48:17.145 --> 01:48:23.737]  Then I'd be like, if we bordered Switzerland, I'm not saying it's superior, but in some ways it's more beautiful and has a second amendment and the rest of it, I'd be like...
[01:48:24.727 --> 01:48:28.410]  It'd be like if a super hot chick, you know, with 150 IQ said, I'm going to conquer you.
[01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:30.712]  I'd say, well, I'm ready to be conquered.
[01:48:30.712 --> 01:48:31.712]  But I'm married.
[01:48:31.712 --> 01:48:32.613]  My wife is kind of like that.
[01:48:32.613 --> 01:48:38.457]  The point is, what I'm getting at is, it's kind of like if aliens showed up with stuff way better and they weren't enslaving us.
[01:48:38.457 --> 01:48:40.659]  I'd be like, well, I'm ready to work with you.
[01:48:40.659 --> 01:48:48.425]  But if it's illegal aliens that want me to like get a Grim Reaper tattoo on my chest and worship the worst elements of Mexico.
[01:48:48.425 --> 01:48:49.606]  No, I don't want to be part of that.
[01:48:51.199 --> 01:48:56.664]  It's just crazy, the arrogance, the disconnect, the look in these people's eyes.
[01:48:56.664 --> 01:49:00.907]  And like you said, we had the proviso, but we're not attacking Hispanic people for being Hispanics.
[01:49:00.907 --> 01:49:02.809]  These are dumb, brainwashed liberals.
[01:49:02.809 --> 01:49:06.292]  Just like whites act like total monsters, black leftists.
[01:49:06.292 --> 01:49:08.474]  I mean, let's just say it, these people at least look...
[01:49:08.914 --> 01:49:10.014]  Nice.
[01:49:10.014 --> 01:49:14.195]  You know, the whites look like they got their mental patients on average.
[01:49:14.195 --> 01:49:15.335]  And I'm not trying to be mean here.
[01:49:15.335 --> 01:49:18.536]  It's just leftists in general are really a disgusting lot.
[01:49:18.536 --> 01:49:19.756]  And you have some Red Wave.
[01:49:19.756 --> 01:49:23.537]  You have a lot of other powerful videos we're going to get to.
[01:49:23.537 --> 01:49:24.937]  We have my interview with Jesse James.
[01:49:24.937 --> 01:49:26.878]  We haven't aired yet as well.
[01:49:26.878 --> 01:49:28.278]  Will new voters swing the midterms?
[01:49:28.278 --> 01:49:31.099]  I think your interview shows that that's in line with the polls.
[01:49:31.099 --> 01:49:32.519]  But tell us about this next clip, Millie.
[01:49:34.127 --> 01:49:50.807]  Well, that was at the Johnson City, Tennessee rally, where another group of Hispanic protesters decided to interrupt the rally and start running through the crowd chanting, Viva La Raza, Mexico, Mexico, F Trump.
[01:49:50.807 --> 01:49:53.991]  And they essentially were waving a Mexico flag.
[01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:58.694]  At an American rally with our American president.
[01:49:58.694 --> 01:50:06.279]  So essentially some people were upset, but security escorted them out and people instantly kind of crowded around them.
[01:50:06.279 --> 01:50:09.261]  I interviewed and asked what they did that for.
[01:50:09.261 --> 01:50:12.443]  Why are they waving a Mexico flag in America?
[01:50:12.443 --> 01:50:18.247]  And essentially we got to the bottom line where we asked them, do you believe in Mexico first or America first?
[01:50:18.247 --> 01:50:19.928]  And they said Mexico first.
[01:50:20.548 --> 01:50:29.835]  And, essentially, they were upset about even the Mexican President agreeing to the trade deal that Trump had negotiated with Mexico.
[01:50:29.835 --> 01:50:34.318]  We're going to play the video in a minute, but there's this hate of America, and the U.S.
[01:50:34.318 --> 01:50:39.681]  isn't perfect, but the idea that, hey, you know, Mexico actually has a fence and a wall on Guatemala.
[01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:42.784]  You know, Mexico puts people in jail for a year of their illegal aliens.
[01:50:42.784 --> 01:50:47.647]  I mean, they seem to be just, it's like, they just think America's like a doormat or something.
[01:50:49.105 --> 01:50:59.292]  Exactly, and I'm not sure how long this video runs, but I remember at the event there was a gentleman who started talking to the girls and he said, you know, I have German ancestry.
[01:50:59.292 --> 01:51:02.474]  I wouldn't be waving around a German flag.
[01:51:02.474 --> 01:51:07.237]  If you asked me if I were German or American, I would say I'm American 100%.
[01:51:07.237 --> 01:51:08.337]  And that's what I said as well.
[01:51:08.337 --> 01:51:10.158]  I said, I have Irish ancestry.
[01:51:10.158 --> 01:51:14.861]  I would never be waving around an Irish flag in America because I'm American.
[01:51:14.861 --> 01:51:15.582]  Well, it'd be great at St.
[01:51:15.582 --> 01:51:17.183]  Paddy's Day and we all go down and have a good time.
[01:51:17.563 --> 01:51:20.826]  Because that's an event about celebrating heritage.
[01:51:20.826 --> 01:51:22.247]  My daughter's born on Cinco de Mayo.
[01:51:22.247 --> 01:51:23.448]  I love Cinco de Mayo.
[01:51:23.448 --> 01:51:26.470]  I love going and drinking cold beer and eating enchiladas.
[01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:30.434]  So I love to celebrate Mexican heritage, but it doesn't mean that then I hate America.
[01:51:31.513 --> 01:51:33.554]  Well, that's not what they were doing, of course.
[01:51:33.554 --> 01:51:54.347]  They were at an American president's rally, saying Mexico's better, F your president, Viva Mexico, and essentially that Mexico's better, and they have more allegiance to Mexico, and these girls essentially wanted to be able to have dual citizenship, be able to come back and forth between Mexico as they please, and they wanted complete open borders.
[01:51:55.107 --> 01:52:06.392]  Uh, pretty much really heavily liberal-leaning policies when it came to the border, but they just had very disrespectful attitudes towards America and, uh, the people who are Americans of color.
[01:52:06.392 --> 01:52:09.494]  Well, I think it's safe to say you'd get killed in Mexico doing something like this.
[01:52:09.494 --> 01:52:12.875]  Uh, and I'm not saying anybody should hurt these people, I'm just pointing out the obvious.
[01:52:12.875 --> 01:52:13.716]  Let's go ahead and go to the tape.
[01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:18.818]  Why are you waving a Mexican flag like from Mexico?
[01:52:18.818 --> 01:52:19.458]  From Mexico.
[01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:23.523]  We support Mexicans all the way.
[01:52:23.523 --> 01:52:25.285]  So what is the point of it?
[01:52:25.285 --> 01:52:27.247]  Do you guys want to be Americans?
[01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:28.008]  We're not.
[01:52:28.008 --> 01:52:30.290]  No, we're US citizens, but we're just not.
[01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:31.071]  We don't support Trump.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.163]  So do you support America?
[01:52:34.163 --> 01:52:37.947]  I support a good America.
[01:52:37.947 --> 01:52:39.469]  You support a good America?
[01:52:39.469 --> 01:52:40.310]  Yes.
[01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:44.515]  So then why do you guys wave a Mexico flag and not an America flag?
[01:52:44.515 --> 01:52:47.158]  Because we support Mexico and Trump not supporting us.
[01:52:48.405 --> 01:52:51.106]  So, what did you say?
[01:52:51.106 --> 01:52:53.746]  We're supporting our Mexico because Trump doesn't support us.
[01:52:53.746 --> 01:52:54.627]  We support our culture.
[01:52:54.627 --> 01:52:54.767]  Yeah.
[01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:57.087]  We don't think our culture should be deported.
[01:52:57.087 --> 01:53:01.248]  But, okay, so you're US citizens though, right?
[01:53:01.248 --> 01:53:02.809]  Yeah.
[01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:06.370]  So isn't your culture American?
[01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:07.170]  No.
[01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:09.431]  We come from a Mexican lineage.
[01:53:09.431 --> 01:53:11.011]  Therefore, we brought it here into America.
[01:53:11.011 --> 01:53:13.592]  That's why we're a melting pot here in America.
[01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:19.837]  Well, don't you think most people come from different countries, but then they wave the American flag?
[01:53:19.837 --> 01:53:24.401]  For example, many of my ancestors are from Ireland.
[01:53:24.401 --> 01:53:28.004]  I wouldn't go around waving an Irish flag in America.
[01:53:28.004 --> 01:53:29.886]  We all have our own preferences, ma'am.
[01:53:32.208 --> 01:53:33.149]  We're Mexican.
[01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:34.651]  We are Mexican-Americans.
[01:53:34.651 --> 01:53:37.255]  So are you Mexicans first or Americans first?
[01:53:37.255 --> 01:53:37.395]  Yes.
[01:53:37.395 --> 01:53:39.478]  I'm a Mexican first.
[01:53:39.478 --> 01:53:40.699]  I'm a Mexican first.
[01:53:40.699 --> 01:53:43.302]  Because my parents are from Mexico.
[01:53:43.302 --> 01:53:45.445]  So you're Mexican first?
[01:53:45.445 --> 01:53:48.709]  So would you rather be in Mexico or America?
[01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:49.751]  Why can't I be in both?
[01:53:50.771 --> 01:53:51.511]  Whenever I want.
[01:53:51.511 --> 01:53:52.272]  Okay.
[01:53:52.272 --> 01:53:53.412]  It's gonna be above the law.
[01:53:53.412 --> 01:53:56.053]  Is that why you want open borders and stuff?
[01:53:56.053 --> 01:53:56.213]  Yes.
[01:53:56.213 --> 01:53:56.773]  Why not?
[01:53:56.773 --> 01:54:00.394]  Why is Trump's hate so much against Mexico?
[01:54:00.394 --> 01:54:02.535]  What has Mexico ever done to Trump?
[01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:03.395]  Nothing, right?
[01:54:03.395 --> 01:54:07.357]  Well, he just entered- Separating families is a disgrace.
[01:54:07.357 --> 01:54:07.537]  Yes.
[01:54:07.537 --> 01:54:10.038]  Putting children in cages is a disgrace.
[01:54:10.038 --> 01:54:19.061]  So what do you guys think about Trump just negotiating a deal with Mexico, a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that's gonna be mutually beneficial?
[01:54:19.061 --> 01:54:19.701]  He hasn't yet.
[01:54:20.121 --> 01:54:22.525]  He has, we're just waiting for Congress to approve it.
[01:54:22.525 --> 01:54:23.726]  What do you think about it?
[01:54:23.726 --> 01:54:25.208]  I don't think it's right.
[01:54:25.208 --> 01:54:29.053]  Do you think that the Mexican president shouldn't have agreed to terms with him?
[01:54:29.053 --> 01:54:29.774]  Him too.
[01:54:29.774 --> 01:54:30.014]  Really?
[01:54:30.014 --> 01:54:30.255]  Yeah.
[01:54:30.255 --> 01:54:30.355]  Why?
[01:54:30.355 --> 01:54:32.117]  What's bad about the deal?
[01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:46.258]  Alright, well at least I'll give these, ages 15 to 20, I'll give them this.
[01:54:46.258 --> 01:54:48.280]  At least you have the courage to go do it.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.223]  And the girls are all kind of grandstanding and everything, like it's a passion play.
[01:54:51.223 --> 01:54:56.888]  Because they feel like Trump's insulted their heritage, so they're going to throw it back and say we're proud of it.
[01:54:56.888 --> 01:54:57.609]  But see, that's the lie.
[01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:59.671]  They said he's got kids in cages.
[01:54:59.671 --> 01:55:00.892]  That was Obama-era stuff.
[01:55:00.892 --> 01:55:02.234]  They built better systems.
[01:55:02.234 --> 01:55:03.576]  What are you supposed to do?
[01:55:03.576 --> 01:55:08.402]  The point is, is that they feel like they've been insulted, because Trump says all Mexicans are criminals.
[01:55:08.402 --> 01:55:09.483]  Never said it.
[01:55:09.483 --> 01:55:11.465]  So they're believing the lie.
[01:55:11.465 --> 01:55:15.030]  They believe they're good, all proud, here doing this.
[01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:17.513]  It's just an exercise in brainwashing, Milley.
[01:55:19.017 --> 01:55:20.359]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:55:20.359 --> 01:55:34.234]  A lot of them are going off of the fake news and really the fake news mainstream media that's running fake stories like the children in cages or that he called all Mexicans bad words essentially
[01:55:35.026 --> 01:55:43.131]  That is essentially dividing our nation, dividing our country, inciting violence, and at some points even inciting riots.
[01:55:43.131 --> 01:55:58.101]  So what do we do about this problem where we have the mainstream media just blatantly lying and causing warfare between political parties and political groups in America based off of fake news or false information?
[01:55:58.101 --> 01:56:04.425]  That's really the dilemma we're in and it's a matter of trying to get the truth out there, get that real information out there,
[01:56:04.745 --> 01:56:12.113]  So that these people who are so mistaken and misinformed can become rightfully informed.
[01:56:12.113 --> 01:56:14.256]  These people need a dose of the red pill.
[01:56:14.256 --> 01:56:23.726]  They need the truth because maybe if they were to know the truth, they wouldn't have this chip on their shoulder and these anti-American, anti-Trump sentiments.
[01:56:23.886 --> 01:56:29.350]  Absolutely, and all Trump wants is prosperity for everybody, but you can't have collapsed Mexico and no border, and the U.N.
[01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:32.852]  and Soros running it from Guatemala and San Salvador.
[01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:33.412]  That's insane.
[01:56:33.412 --> 01:56:39.096]  We're going to come back and play some of the positive videos you've got that are just amazing.
[01:56:39.096 --> 01:56:40.877]  These are just dynamite, folks.
[01:56:40.877 --> 01:56:45.481]  They're all shadow banned, but they're on Infowars.com and Newswars.com every day.
[01:56:46.385 --> 01:56:50.327]  I want to create tabs on the side of InfoWars that are Millie Weaver, David Knight, everybody.

[01:56:56.470 --> 01:57:00.772]  We're redoing InfoWars in the next few months, kind of like News Wars, but a lot's going on.

[01:59:01.877 --> 01:59:06.582]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.582 --> 01:59:09.865]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.726 --> 01:59:21.729]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.729 --> 01:59:30.272]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.

[01:59:45.246 --> 01:59:46.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.777 --> 02:00:14.246]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.939 --> 02:00:26.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, as a lot of you know, it's been a big national news story.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:33.522]  Tim Cook, two days ago, came out and gave a Vice News interview where he said, he's curating me off the internet.
[02:00:33.522 --> 02:00:35.243]  Hitler called himself a curator.
[02:00:35.243 --> 02:00:43.185]  So I guess when you wipe people out, take their speech, Apple helps suppress people politically with their political speech and helps round them up in China.
[02:00:44.005 --> 02:00:45.586]  I guess he thinks that's cute.
[02:00:45.586 --> 02:00:47.387]  I guess he thinks that's funny.
[02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:58.614]  But now we know that Apple is working with the Chinese government to give all your code keys to the government, they admit that, and putting spy chips in the Apple phones and devices to literally spy on U.S.
[02:00:58.614 --> 02:01:00.095]  citizens and the U.S.
[02:01:00.095 --> 02:01:01.797]  government.
[02:01:01.797 --> 02:01:09.261]  And Tim Cook has come out and said that he is happy to help China censor and that he wants to do it here.
[02:01:09.261 --> 02:01:13.004]  I'm going to break it all down, but here's what's amazing.
[02:01:14.079 --> 02:01:16.561]  Watching the Vice video that we'll roll some of.
[02:01:16.561 --> 02:01:18.922]  This is unaltered.
[02:01:18.922 --> 02:01:24.766]  He is in Grand Central Station in New York with bright lights in his face glaring.
[02:01:24.766 --> 02:01:29.128]  And his pupils are 90% full.
[02:01:29.128 --> 02:01:30.649]  That's LSD.
[02:01:30.649 --> 02:01:33.531]  That's two rails of methamphetamine.
[02:01:33.531 --> 02:01:36.252]  That's a large dose of psilocybin mushrooms.
[02:01:36.252 --> 02:01:40.155]  And then when you know, when you know
[02:01:43.041 --> 02:01:48.283]  About the history of Silicon Valley and hardcore psychedelics and micro-dosing of drugs.
[02:01:48.283 --> 02:01:50.463]  Who knows what synthetic drugs he's on?
[02:01:50.463 --> 02:01:52.304]  Who knows what designer drugs he's on?
[02:01:52.304 --> 02:01:57.165]  But throughout the interview, this guy, in fact, that pause video is even the most powerful.
[02:01:57.165 --> 02:01:58.345]  There's some video there.
[02:01:58.345 --> 02:02:02.667]  That's only 80%, which any cop would say, boy, what are you on?
[02:02:02.667 --> 02:02:08.048]  But then they just, they go from 80 to 90% like he's some type of cartoon character.
[02:02:08.048 --> 02:02:09.829]  So no wonder he's so skinny.
[02:02:10.706 --> 02:02:13.087]  I mean, what is Tim Cook taking?
[02:02:13.087 --> 02:02:14.548]  We know he smoked the dope of tyranny.
[02:02:14.548 --> 02:02:16.610]  We know he's helping China censor people.
[02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:18.731]  But this is really serious for everybody to ask.
[02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:20.832]  Why is he helping censor in America?
[02:02:20.832 --> 02:02:29.097]  Why is he helping now work with Facebook and Google to create AI and suppress the population under a program called Skynet?
[02:02:29.097 --> 02:02:30.238]  Why?
[02:02:30.238 --> 02:02:32.199]  That's a big question and it's in the news today that
[02:02:33.206 --> 02:02:37.410]  Now, Facebook and Google are teaming up with the Chinese in AI.
[02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:38.971]  So this is serious tyranny.
[02:02:38.971 --> 02:02:44.196]  Billy, we're going to come back in a moment and get more to this, but he needs to really explain what's going on with him.
[02:02:44.196 --> 02:02:56.748]  What do you make of Tim Cook and just, he's in the news saying, I want to censor everybody, taking people's speeches, just curating, like there's a museum and if some of us don't live, some of us don't survive, I guess, politically or physically.
[02:02:58.106 --> 02:02:59.366]  Well, I think he's a traitor.
[02:02:59.366 --> 02:03:05.368]  I think he's a sellout to the Chinese, just like the Clintons, just like most of the Democrats are.
[02:03:05.368 --> 02:03:10.330]  And he, being the tech representative he is, we already know they've sold out to the Chinese.
[02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:16.171]  So, as far as his dilated pupils, it could be we're saying LSD.
[02:03:16.171 --> 02:03:17.452]  It could also be cocaine.
[02:03:17.452 --> 02:03:21.553]  It could be Adderall, which people take for ADD.
[02:03:21.553 --> 02:03:24.474]  It could be that he's actually very attractive.
[02:03:24.734 --> 02:03:25.774]  Yeah, I looked that up.
[02:03:25.774 --> 02:03:27.675]  It would take a large dose of Adderall to do that though.
[02:03:49.043 --> 02:03:49.584]  I'm sure.
[02:03:49.584 --> 02:03:51.085]  I'm sure.
[02:03:51.085 --> 02:04:06.058]  I know that college kids tend to use Adderall a bunch to really focus and, you know, and I've known my sister took Adderall before and she just acted really irate and crazy when she was on it and just didn't even act like herself.
[02:04:06.058 --> 02:04:08.340]  So people can act pretty bizarre
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.143]  Sure, but I mean, looking at this, he's in television cameras.
[02:04:12.143 --> 02:04:13.864]  I mean, you're just in regular light right now.
[02:04:13.864 --> 02:04:16.026]  Here, let's zoom in on your eyes.
[02:04:16.026 --> 02:04:17.667]  That won't be painful to anybody, will it?
[02:04:17.667 --> 02:04:19.608]  Let's zoom in, if we can, on Millie Weaver's eyes.
[02:04:19.608 --> 02:04:21.790]  I mean, that's a normal pupil size.
[02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:23.531]  I'm under harsh lights.
[02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:26.754]  Can we zoom in on camera four or some other camera, maybe five?
[02:04:26.754 --> 02:04:27.995]  Okay, so that's a normal pupil.
[02:04:27.995 --> 02:04:28.856]  Let's zoom in on mine.
[02:04:28.856 --> 02:04:30.257]  And here's the thing.
[02:04:30.257 --> 02:04:32.739]  I mean, I've only had a bottle of vodka, so... I'm joking.
[02:04:32.739 --> 02:04:33.099]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:34.025 --> 02:04:36.928]  Typically, I have dilated pupils.
[02:04:36.928 --> 02:04:43.134]  I actually, one time, the police, when I was pulled over, was trying to lighten my eyes and said, am I on drugs?
[02:04:43.134 --> 02:04:44.896]  Because my pupils were dilated.
[02:04:44.896 --> 02:04:47.719]  And it's just usually I have dilated eyes.
[02:04:47.719 --> 02:04:50.842]  And right now, even with the lighting, you can see that my eyes are dilated.
[02:04:50.842 --> 02:04:50.942]  Sure.
[02:04:50.942 --> 02:04:53.224]  Well, what we know is your eyes are 10 times smaller than Tim Cook's.
[02:04:53.224 --> 02:04:54.806]  So he's got some explaining to do.
[02:04:54.806 --> 02:04:55.667]  No wonder he supports tyranny.
[02:04:56.328 --> 02:05:03.811]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[02:05:03.811 --> 02:05:13.054]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:13.054 --> 02:05:22.118]  Containing powerful antioxidants, such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:34.515]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:05:34.515 --> 02:05:43.679]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:05:44.079 --> 02:05:44.379]  We're good.
[02:06:06.298 --> 02:06:10.763]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:14.006]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:38.877]  So there's Tim Cook in his interview lying about me and lying about free speech and lying about censorship.
[02:06:38.877 --> 02:06:41.178]  Looks like he's on about three hits of LSD at least.
[02:06:41.178 --> 02:06:42.780]  Let's go to my eyes right now.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:47.063]  I'm only on one hit of LSD and my eyes aren't even dilated.
[02:06:47.063 --> 02:06:47.724]  They're contracted.
[02:06:47.724 --> 02:06:48.465]  Let's go back.
[02:06:48.465 --> 02:06:51.307]  One hit of LSD and they're still or small.
[02:06:51.307 --> 02:06:51.888]  I'm joking.
[02:06:51.888 --> 02:06:53.789]  I'm not on LSD.
[02:06:53.789 --> 02:06:54.190]  Good lord.
[02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:57.232]  I am a serious conservative, as everyone knows.
[02:06:57.232 --> 02:06:59.414]  I'm out in Silicon Valley with a, admittedly, microdose.
[02:06:59.414 --> 02:07:00.835]  But what is going on with his eyes?
[02:07:00.835 --> 02:07:04.719]  Yes, cocaine, high amounts of methamphetamine, Adderall can do it.
[02:07:04.719 --> 02:07:07.461]  Millie, we were putting a bow on all this.
[02:07:07.461 --> 02:07:08.562]  This is pretty serious.
[02:07:08.562 --> 02:07:12.766]  If I was on TV with, because I slur my words at night.
[02:07:12.766 --> 02:07:17.210]  Even if I had a beer or two, if I get really tired, eat something, about every six, seven hours, I kind of start slowing down.
[02:07:17.210 --> 02:07:18.451]  Oh, has he been drinking?
[02:07:18.451 --> 02:07:18.551]  No.
[02:07:19.272 --> 02:07:26.295]  But if I had pupils that looked like I was a raccoon or something, people would say, whoa, what is Jones on?
[02:07:26.295 --> 02:07:30.397]  And then you look at his methamphetamine buzzard appearance.
[02:07:30.397 --> 02:07:38.421]  I mean, I think we may have like a dangerous meth fiend allied with Communist China that's helping him put spy chips on our computers and helping round up political dissidents.
[02:07:38.421 --> 02:07:39.001]  What do you think, Milley?
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:48.303]  Well, I think that cocaine is very prevalent in wealthy circles, and he could just be on a lot of cocaine.
[02:07:48.303 --> 02:07:56.486]  Now, Alex, in your opinion, since we're doing this forensic analysis of Tim Cook's eyes, did you think that his voice sounded nasally?
[02:07:56.486 --> 02:08:01.687]  Because I know people with cocaine habits sound very nasally when they talk.
[02:08:01.687 --> 02:08:02.788]  Did he sound nasally to you?
[02:08:04.339 --> 02:08:11.178]  He just sounded like a tyrant that's allied with China, but he puts on the whole Nelly act, so then it's okay.
[02:08:11.178 --> 02:08:11.679]  That's what I think.
[02:08:12.970 --> 02:08:17.412]  Yeah, well, regardless of whatever this guy's on, we know that he's a sellout.
[02:08:17.412 --> 02:08:24.194]  We know that him and China are literally collaborating to try to fix or interfere with the midterms.
[02:08:24.194 --> 02:08:33.197]  President Trump addressed that in front of all of these nations, and the Chinese representative just rolled his eyes like, okay, yeah, so what?
[02:08:33.197 --> 02:08:35.118]  You're calling us out on what we're doing.
[02:08:35.118 --> 02:08:39.179]  Of course we're going to try to infiltrate and mess with your midterm elections.
[02:08:39.179 --> 02:08:40.240]  So we've got China.
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:50.013]  On the record, messing with midterms, or trying to, and now we've got the sellout big tech guys who are also trying to mess with the midterms.
[02:08:50.013 --> 02:08:57.423]  What do you think banning Alex Jones off of Facebook and all of these different social media platforms is designed to do?
[02:08:57.984 --> 02:09:08.775]  It's to silence our voices because, hey, Hillary Clinton wouldn't have said, if it weren't for Alex Jones, you know, why why aren't I 20 points ahead?
[02:09:08.775 --> 02:09:13.019]  Oh, if it weren't for Alex Jones, she literally says Alex Jones and Infowars.
[02:09:13.019 --> 02:09:13.600]  Yeah, because.
[02:09:14.511 --> 02:09:32.021]  Not to say that it's just us in an arrogant way, but what I'm saying is the amount of people, you the listeners, sharing the articles, sharing the videos, getting the information out to massive amounts of people, it made a huge impact on the 2016 election.
[02:09:32.021 --> 02:09:38.744]  And you guys have just as much ability to make that exact same impact, if not bigger, during the midterms.
[02:09:38.744 --> 02:09:43.167]  And so that's what they are desperately afraid of and why they're trying to do everything they can
[02:09:43.727 --> 02:09:55.614]  To suppress Infowars, ban Alex Jones and essentially ban conservatives off of social media that are going to be doing the groundwork, the grassroots work to wake people up.
[02:09:58.246 --> 02:10:03.631]  Now, Millie, I want to get to your report, but I also want to play a clip since you mentioned it.
[02:10:03.631 --> 02:10:06.934]  I mean, Hillary gave all these speeches saying, we must shut down fake news.
[02:10:06.934 --> 02:10:08.415]  Alex Jones is fake news.
[02:10:08.415 --> 02:10:09.797]  And we know they meet with big tech.
[02:10:09.797 --> 02:10:15.402]  We've got photos and videos and articles of Tim Cook and all the big tech heads meeting with Obama and pledging Hillary that she would win.
[02:10:15.402 --> 02:10:17.824]  And Tim Cook saying, we'll deliver you the election.
[02:10:17.824 --> 02:10:20.767]  And the head of Google saying, we'll deliver you the election.
[02:10:20.767 --> 02:10:22.509]  I mean, they're doing this.
[02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:24.451]  And now they're engaged in it.
[02:10:24.451 --> 02:10:26.814]  Meanwhile, he's in China admitting he censors.
[02:10:26.814 --> 02:10:34.985]  And then he's involved with his company, Apple, helping put computer chips in to spy on US citizens for the Chinese government.
[02:10:34.985 --> 02:10:36.467]  I mean, look at how far they've gone!
[02:10:36.467 --> 02:10:38.890]  Of course he's arrogant towards Congress.
[02:10:38.890 --> 02:10:40.212]  Of course Tim Cook thinks he's God.
[02:10:41.775 --> 02:10:49.660]  Yeah, because they've essentially compromised many of the US politicians that are in power, especially those on the Democrat side.
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:53.982]  Not to say that there aren't Republican rhinos that have been compromised.
[02:10:53.982 --> 02:10:57.144]  I'm sure there have been, of course.
[02:10:57.144 --> 02:11:04.929]  But I would say a lot of them, like Senator Feinstein, who had a Chinese spy as her driver for a couple decades.
[02:11:04.929 --> 02:11:07.470]  Yeah, you better bet that she's compromised.
[02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:09.972]  You better bet that Hillary Clinton is compromised.
[02:11:09.972 --> 02:11:10.352]  Let's be clear.
[02:11:10.532 --> 02:11:13.254]  China was set up by the globalists as a money laundering base.
[02:11:13.254 --> 02:11:17.398]  A lot of people say, oh, Israel was set up by Western elites as a money laundering base.
[02:11:17.398 --> 02:11:18.079]  Yes, that's true.
[02:11:18.079 --> 02:11:20.100]  It doesn't mean I hate Israel, but it's a fact.
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:21.361]  And Israel's got its problems.
[02:11:21.361 --> 02:11:23.964]  But China's a billion, four hundred million people.
[02:11:23.964 --> 02:11:25.885]  It's the biggest industrial base in the world now.
[02:11:25.885 --> 02:11:29.148]  And if you're a globalist, you can go there and kill people.
[02:11:29.148 --> 02:11:30.910]  You can go there and not pay any taxes.
[02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:33.132]  You can do whatever you want as long as you're part of the party.
[02:11:33.132 --> 02:11:34.032]  It is so corrupt.
[02:11:34.813 --> 02:11:40.735]  And that's why Hillary set up the plan to have me banned off of the internet to set the precedent.
[02:11:40.735 --> 02:11:43.036]  She was going to do this whether she lost or won.
[02:11:43.036 --> 02:11:44.296]  Here's that report breaking it down.
[02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:46.697]  I cannot make this stuff up.
[02:11:46.697 --> 02:11:48.117]  And I tell you all of it.
[02:11:48.117 --> 02:11:54.339]  I could literally keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable.
[02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:56.100]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[02:12:01.664 --> 02:12:10.114]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year.
[02:12:10.114 --> 02:12:14.699]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[02:12:14.699 --> 02:12:15.580]  See how powerful she is?
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:20.966]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel... She made all this up a couple years ago.
[02:12:21.847 --> 02:12:24.309]  And now Breitbart just got banned today.
[02:12:24.309 --> 02:12:25.289]  See how it works?
[02:12:25.289 --> 02:12:26.210]  Because Congress did not.
[02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:29.072]  And if they can get people to put up with this, they're going to make their martial law move.
[02:12:45.154 --> 02:12:51.616]  Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda.
[02:12:51.616 --> 02:12:55.117]  Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge.
[02:12:55.117 --> 02:12:58.658]  They put stay-behind networks in the Defense Department.
[02:12:58.658 --> 02:13:01.579]  Literally shutting me down.
[02:13:01.579 --> 02:13:04.640]  Because I'm a loyal American.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.061]  I'm a Russian agent, as I point out.
[02:13:06.061 --> 02:13:09.202]  The Chinese government puts chips in the damn phones.
[02:13:09.202 --> 02:13:09.822]  Stealing your data.
[02:13:12.604 --> 02:13:19.249]  That chip is the access point in the hardware for the wireless appliances they already have to steal everything you've got.
[02:13:19.249 --> 02:13:20.329]  And Tim Cook's involved.
[02:13:20.329 --> 02:13:20.830]  Guess what, monster?
[02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:22.231]  It's on the cover of Bloomberg now.
[02:13:22.231 --> 02:13:24.713]  There's nothing you can do, scum.
[02:13:35.473 --> 02:13:37.394]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:13:37.394 --> 02:13:39.214]  I will not... You see, there's a litmus test now.
[02:13:39.214 --> 02:13:41.795]  ...be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:13:41.795 --> 02:13:48.057]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[02:13:48.057 --> 02:13:59.780]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment process.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:00.541]  Led by Jim Cooke.
[02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:03.842]  ...the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube... Led by China.
[02:14:03.842 --> 02:14:05.142]  He criticized the government, your banking state.
[02:14:05.162 --> 02:14:09.866]  I'm glad that the Congress and others are looking at Facebook and Twitter and Google because they are the vehicle.
[02:14:27.611 --> 02:14:29.872]  See folks, I was willing to stand up against her.
[02:14:29.872 --> 02:14:30.452]  I believe in you.
[02:14:30.452 --> 02:14:31.393]  I need you to back me.
[02:14:31.393 --> 02:14:32.293]  I need you to back me.
[02:14:54.389 --> 02:14:58.070]  I need you to tell people about the local station.
[02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:03.312]  However you're listening, do it now.
[02:15:03.312 --> 02:15:04.792]  America can beat these people.
[02:15:04.792 --> 02:15:06.053]  It's coming back.
[02:15:06.053 --> 02:15:06.953]  We are the Americans.
[02:15:06.953 --> 02:15:08.173]  Don't listen to them.
[02:15:08.173 --> 02:15:09.914]  We are the Americans!
[02:15:09.914 --> 02:15:11.054]  We're anti-abortion!
[02:15:11.054 --> 02:15:12.234]  We're pro-gun!
[02:15:12.234 --> 02:15:14.955]  We're pro-free speech, not them!
[02:15:14.955 --> 02:15:16.816]  I don't own slave factories in China!
[02:15:16.816 --> 02:15:17.736]  I'm the American, not them!
[02:15:17.736 --> 02:15:18.476]  Stand up for me!
[02:15:24.298 --> 02:15:25.378]  Shame on the mainstream.
[02:15:25.378 --> 02:15:27.719]  Or you'll never stand up for yourselves!
[02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:35.580]  But instead, a cat-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with big tech.
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:45.742]  We'll come back with Milley and these other clubs, and then we've got Gregory's coming in here with some really interesting stuff, trying to bring liberty and freedom to Iran, which would really help free the whole Central Asia, Middle East, would be a positive thing.
[02:15:45.742 --> 02:15:50.123]  And I think the Restart Program is a great group of people, and I'm very excited to be promoting it.
[02:15:51.027 --> 02:15:53.118]  Lord knows our own damn government isn't doing it.
[02:15:53.118 --> 02:15:54.385]  It's all run by a bunch of leftists.
[02:15:55.248 --> 02:16:01.932]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:16:34.296 --> 02:16:42.644]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:18:05.282 --> 02:18:16.111]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:18:16.111 --> 02:18:18.233]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[02:18:37.306 --> 02:18:39.787]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:19:45.554 --> 02:19:47.575]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:19:47.575 --> 02:19:50.876]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:19:50.876 --> 02:19:53.417]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[02:19:53.417 --> 02:19:59.240]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.921]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.173 --> 02:20:19.774]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:19.774 --> 02:20:25.555]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:25.555 --> 02:20:39.918]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[02:20:39.918 --> 02:20:43.839]  They just give me a number
[02:20:45.793 --> 02:20:50.376]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[02:20:59.742 --> 02:21:07.512]  Alright, the Senate is getting ready with Senator Grassley and other Republican leadership to give a press conference on the Kavanaugh nomination.
[02:21:07.512 --> 02:21:09.255]  So we'll go to that as soon as it comes up.
[02:21:09.255 --> 02:21:16.484]  We've got important clips coming up about the Iranian restart movement based out of here in the United States.
[02:21:17.085 --> 02:21:18.686]  Millie Weaver's here with us riding shotgun.
[02:21:18.686 --> 02:21:22.328]  As soon as this press conference goes live, we'll cut to that.
[02:21:22.328 --> 02:21:35.135]  But Millie's shifting gears out of the incredible censorship led by Apple, and how they're openly working with China against the U.S., with Facebook and Google now joining forces on AI.
[02:21:35.135 --> 02:21:38.276]  They've denied the Pentagon access to it, even though the Pentagon paid for it.
[02:21:38.276 --> 02:21:45.000]  Just the belligerency of this shows that Hillary had already made the deal to sell the country out, and they just have no respect for President Trump.
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:47.022]  But the Pentagon knows what's going on.
[02:21:47.022 --> 02:21:49.544]  Not that they're perfect, but at least they're not for selling the country out.
[02:21:49.544 --> 02:21:51.106]  My God, we're in some dark hours here.
[02:21:51.106 --> 02:21:52.107]  But what about this?
[02:21:52.107 --> 02:21:54.270]  Will new voters swing the midterms?
[02:21:54.270 --> 02:22:01.678]  A lot of polls coming out, even their fake polls, show 5, 10, 15 point increase in swing voters, folks that never voted.
[02:22:01.678 --> 02:22:03.600]  And that's what you're finding around the country, isn't it?
[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:26.364]  Exactly and what we found at this Trump rally was that a lot of people who prefer to stay out of politics and don't vote are getting out and they're preparing to vote in the midterms because they realize how important their voice is right now and they like what Trump's doing so they're gonna make sure they get out there and cast their vote.
[02:22:26.364 --> 02:22:27.765]  I talked to people who are in their 30s and
[02:22:29.445 --> 02:22:29.825]  I don't
[02:22:47.265 --> 02:22:59.670]  A record 800,000 people registered to vote last week on National Voter Registration Day, which set a new record for the first day of registration for voting.
[02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:04.432]  Last year, or not last year, but the year before last year, in 2016, the previous record was set at 771,000.
[02:23:09.834 --> 02:23:10.835]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:28.046]  That's what we all want to know.
[02:23:28.046 --> 02:23:40.660]  And many Trump supporters are getting out there and voting and encouraging, Trump's essentially encouraging people who didn't bother with politics before to actually participate.
[02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:44.765]  And it's also these bogus allegations that we've heard from
[02:23:45.505 --> 02:23:59.415]  Dr. Ford on Kavanaugh that's upsetting a lot of people and motivating them to actually... Oh, I know a lot of liberals that were on the fence now and they're totally supporting Trump and everybody because this is so obvious how the whole story falls apart.
[02:23:59.415 --> 02:24:01.096]  Millie Weaver, I'm gonna play some of your reports.
[02:24:01.096 --> 02:24:01.897]  They're great.
[02:24:01.897 --> 02:24:04.939]  There's other reports we don't have time to get to on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:04.939 --> 02:24:05.399]  Keep it up.
[02:24:05.399 --> 02:24:06.480]  You and your team are on fire.
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.081]  God bless you.
[02:24:08.081 --> 02:24:08.701]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:13.205]  You guys can find more of my reports on Millennial Millie on YouTube or on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:17.182]  And plug the Twitter while you still got it, too.
[02:24:17.182 --> 02:24:21.305]  Yeah, my Twitter account is MillieWeaver on Twitter.
[02:24:21.305 --> 02:24:22.506]  So you can find me there.
[02:24:22.506 --> 02:24:25.349]  I've got a little red MAGA hat on and my verification tag.
[02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.849]  All right, keep it up.
[02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:27.110]  Amazing job.
[02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:30.072]  Let's go ahead and go to part of her report, which is basically unedited.
[02:24:30.072 --> 02:24:34.036]  It's just interview after interview of every race, color, and creed saying they support Trump.
[02:24:34.036 --> 02:24:34.376]  Here it is.
[02:24:40.299 --> 02:24:42.660]  Are you guys planning on voting for the midterms?
[02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:43.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:44.401]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:24:44.401 --> 02:24:45.821]  Yes.
[02:24:45.821 --> 02:24:48.883]  We'll be for Trump and probably all Republican.
[02:24:48.883 --> 02:24:49.423]  Yes.
[02:24:49.423 --> 02:24:50.243]  Yes, definitely.
[02:24:50.243 --> 02:24:51.524]  Yes, I dare him.
[02:24:51.524 --> 02:24:52.044]  Definitely.
[02:24:52.044 --> 02:24:53.125]  Yeah.
[02:24:53.125 --> 02:24:56.266]  I probably got to be a little bit more informed, but absolutely, yes.
[02:24:56.266 --> 02:24:58.427]  Who do you plan on voting for and why?
[02:24:58.427 --> 02:24:59.367]  And to keep America great.
[02:24:59.367 --> 02:25:00.228]  I like what he's doing.
[02:25:00.228 --> 02:25:00.748]  I do.
[02:25:00.748 --> 02:25:03.109]  I plan on voting in the midterms.
[02:25:03.109 --> 02:25:03.529]  Absolutely.
[02:25:03.529 --> 02:25:04.009]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:25:04.009 --> 02:25:05.570]  I always vote every election.
[02:25:06.627 --> 02:25:08.648]  Are you going to be voting this midterm election?
[02:25:08.648 --> 02:25:09.188]  Yes, I will.
[02:25:09.188 --> 02:25:11.128]  You better believe it.
[02:25:11.128 --> 02:25:12.429]  I sure will.
[02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:14.749]  Who are you going to be voting for and why?
[02:25:14.749 --> 02:25:18.650]  Marsha Blackburn because I want the Republicans to stay in there.
[02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:19.871]  Absolutely.
[02:25:19.871 --> 02:25:23.111]  I'm going to vote for Marsha.
[02:25:23.111 --> 02:25:24.492]  I plan to.
[02:25:24.492 --> 02:25:24.952]  Yeah?
[02:25:24.952 --> 02:25:25.172]  Yeah.
[02:25:26.189 --> 02:25:26.549]  Why?
[02:25:26.549 --> 02:25:28.090]  Do you usually vote during the midterms?
[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:29.892]  I've never voted in my life.
[02:25:29.892 --> 02:25:33.694]  This year, just because the races I know are so close, I'll make sure I do.
[02:25:33.694 --> 02:25:35.515]  I won't have any excuses, so.
[02:25:35.515 --> 02:25:37.757]  Do you guys typically vote for midterm elections?
[02:25:38.821 --> 02:25:42.062]  I did not last time, no.
[02:25:42.062 --> 02:25:44.263]  I will be this time for sure.
[02:25:44.263 --> 02:25:49.826]  Not really, but I'm going to because this one is Trump and all the good people that are standing up this time around.
[02:25:49.826 --> 02:25:59.810]  I haven't voted before ever and now they, just the corruption and using our intelligence agencies, politically motivated.
[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:00.570]  Yes, I do now.
[02:26:02.085 --> 02:26:04.166]  Have you voted during midterms in the past?
[02:26:04.166 --> 02:26:12.729]  To be totally honest with you, I'm 35, but I guess technically I'm still a millennial, even though I don't identify in that manner.
[02:26:12.729 --> 02:26:16.071]  And wasn't so politically active until Trump came along.
[02:26:16.071 --> 02:26:17.591]  So no, I haven't voted before.
[02:26:17.591 --> 02:26:18.712]  All this has changed my mind.
[02:26:18.712 --> 02:26:19.992]  I have to vote now.
[02:26:19.992 --> 02:26:22.753]  So do you usually vote during the midterms?
[02:26:22.753 --> 02:26:23.694]  I haven't, no.
[02:26:23.694 --> 02:26:24.614]  No?
[02:26:24.614 --> 02:26:27.335]  I think it's a very important time that we do it.
[02:26:27.335 --> 02:26:28.576]  What's the motivating factor?
[02:26:29.336 --> 02:26:31.798]  Uh, to clean up the swamp in Washington.
[02:26:31.798 --> 02:26:38.141]  To keep folks like Maxine Waters and the rest of that tribe out of power.
[02:26:38.141 --> 02:26:39.142]  Or out of absolute power.
[02:26:39.142 --> 02:26:40.482]  All the crazy people?
[02:26:40.482 --> 02:26:42.123]  Yeah, that.
[02:26:42.123 --> 02:26:46.386]  We don't want the Democrats because they're misleading a lot of folks out there.
[02:26:46.386 --> 02:26:48.607]  Just because it's a numbers game and the
[02:26:49.507 --> 02:26:52.749]  The way the Democrats are acting, they don't need control of the Senate.
[02:26:52.749 --> 02:26:57.152]  It's to keep the House in Republican control, really.
[02:26:57.152 --> 02:26:58.113]  And the Senate, too.
[02:26:58.113 --> 02:27:03.757]  The Senate looks like it might hold on a little longer, but it's the House, really, that we're concerned about.
[02:27:03.757 --> 02:27:11.082]  Because anytime you have one or both houses of government that are in the other party's hands, we can't get legislation to go through.
[02:27:11.082 --> 02:27:13.664]  The motivation is to keep this country great again.
[02:27:13.664 --> 02:27:16.746]  To keep the economy and everything going good like Trump's doing.
[02:27:16.746 --> 02:27:18.327]  Are you familiar with the Q?
[02:27:19.770 --> 02:27:21.852]  So QAnon is motivating you?
[02:27:21.852 --> 02:27:22.793]  Absolutely.
[02:27:22.793 --> 02:27:26.416]  Well, I'm a citizen of the United States and that's my right.
[02:27:26.416 --> 02:27:28.398]  Tell them who we're voting for.
[02:27:28.398 --> 02:27:29.540]  By the way, fade this down.
[02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:31.301]  The full report is on mfulworths.com.
[02:27:31.301 --> 02:27:32.903]  I want to say something about the QAnon thing.
[02:27:34.733 --> 02:27:42.058]  I got on board with it back when it popped up last year because I like Dr. Corsi and he thought it was good information and some of it was good information.
[02:27:42.058 --> 02:27:44.139]  Obviously smart people were saying that stuff.
[02:27:44.139 --> 02:27:50.263]  Then it said Mueller's a good guy and all this other stuff and I just don't buy that and I'm allowed to say I think Mueller's bad.
[02:27:50.263 --> 02:27:57.088]  And then I've seen people who say they're with the QAnon thing say horrible things about me that aren't true so I jump on and say, you know, screw you, you're full of crap.
[02:27:58.266 --> 02:28:02.191]  My wife likes the QAnon stuff.
[02:28:02.191 --> 02:28:03.113]  Lionel likes it.
[02:28:03.113 --> 02:28:04.054]  Lionel's a great guy.
[02:28:04.054 --> 02:28:07.859]  A lot of people I know like it and get something good out of it.
[02:28:07.859 --> 02:28:08.540]  And so great!
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:09.061]  Here's the deal.
[02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:09.962]  I'm not anonymous.
[02:28:09.962 --> 02:28:10.523]  I'm on air.
[02:28:10.523 --> 02:28:12.025]  They're coming after me.
[02:28:12.025 --> 02:28:13.086]  This is real.
[02:28:13.086 --> 02:28:13.767]  I'm a patriot.
[02:28:14.548 --> 02:28:22.237]  And then when people get on board with the QAnon thing and are saying, of course he's bad and I'm bad, that's when I started saying, you're full of crap.
[02:28:22.237 --> 02:28:24.440]  Some anonymous person saying something about me.
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:26.722]  We helped launch the whole Trump revolution.
[02:28:26.722 --> 02:28:27.563]  We're the patriots.
[02:28:27.563 --> 02:28:29.025]  We're pro-Second Amendment.
[02:28:29.025 --> 02:28:31.068]  They're going to take our banking away right now.
[02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:34.131]  So I'm not going to get into this whole QAnon fight.
[02:28:35.189 --> 02:28:40.774]  And so I'm going to try to go research it and find some stuff I agree with just to hope.
[02:28:40.774 --> 02:28:42.776]  Fine, okay, Mueller's a great guy.
[02:28:42.776 --> 02:28:43.617]  It's all a big ruse.
[02:28:43.617 --> 02:28:45.338]  Everything's great.
[02:28:45.338 --> 02:28:47.260]  Tell you why Mueller tried to set me up a month ago?
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.721]  God Almighty.
[02:28:48.721 --> 02:28:53.526]  Anyways, we're going to come back with some really good news about how to try to free Iran and the press conference.
[02:28:55.475 --> 02:28:57.336]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[02:33:49.505 --> 02:33:54.801]  And we'll go to this whole movement with Restart and Iran regardless anyway.

[02:34:09.676 --> 02:34:13.280]  Obviously, this is terrorism, political terrorism.
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:15.061]  The wheels have come off of it, but they don't care.
[02:34:15.061 --> 02:34:16.903]  They're just moving forward.
[02:34:16.903 --> 02:34:21.227]  We'll see what's going to happen when this immovable object runs into the unstoppable force.
[02:34:22.483 --> 02:34:27.188]  I want to look at the restart movement here in Iran in just a moment, and so much more.
[02:34:27.188 --> 02:34:32.313]  But first off, you know the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[02:34:32.313 --> 02:34:34.054]  You know they're trying to silence our speech.
[02:34:34.054 --> 02:34:35.055]  You see it everywhere.
[02:34:35.055 --> 02:34:38.739]  Now Breitbart is being removed from everything.
[02:34:38.739 --> 02:34:39.720]  We knew that that was coming.
[02:34:41.463 --> 02:34:42.904]  Now they're going after PayPal.
[02:34:42.904 --> 02:34:46.445]  I filed an emergency injunction so you can still use PayPal at Infowarstore.com.
[02:34:46.445 --> 02:34:48.426]  We have other payment processor systems.
[02:34:48.426 --> 02:34:51.027]  The point is, I have to stop backing down.
[02:34:51.027 --> 02:34:52.467]  I don't want to sue.
[02:34:52.467 --> 02:34:53.988]  I don't want to be litigious.
[02:34:53.988 --> 02:34:56.349]  It's very expensive, but this is the mark of the beast.
[02:34:56.349 --> 02:35:01.611]  Denying conservatives, libertarians, nationalists, Christians from the marketplace of ideas.
[02:35:01.611 --> 02:35:05.812]  They've tried to have major companies come in and take our software away, but we have contracts on it.
[02:35:05.812 --> 02:35:09.894]  This is Silicon Valley assaulting in mass humanity.
[02:35:11.186 --> 02:35:12.750]  Just like I had to end the X2 special.
[02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:13.793]  It's over.
[02:35:13.793 --> 02:35:14.816]  As of this week.
[02:35:14.816 --> 02:35:16.079]  Because it's getting close to selling out.
[02:35:16.079 --> 02:35:17.583]  And it's the last run we have.
[02:35:18.587 --> 02:35:22.730]  Same thing with Brain Force Plus, the Great Nootropic.
[02:35:22.730 --> 02:35:27.352]  50% off, 40% off, 40% off, the Secret 12 Vitamin B12.
[02:35:27.352 --> 02:35:29.674]  Those specials have to end today or tomorrow.
[02:35:29.674 --> 02:35:32.456]  I've just been so busy with news, I haven't come up with new specials.
[02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:37.519]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:35:37.519 --> 02:35:45.464]  And I see the folks wearing the InfoWars shirts all over the place, out there, and it's really, really amazing.
[02:35:46.424 --> 02:35:48.925]  Uh, at the Trump rallies and on the streets.
[02:35:48.925 --> 02:35:50.026]  So choose your own adventure.
[02:35:50.026 --> 02:35:58.209]  You wear a big, loud Trump 2020 shirt, or re-elect Trump, you might get hit in the head with a bike lock, you know, or stabbed in a liberal area, in a fascist area.
[02:35:58.209 --> 02:36:00.250]  You might get your dinner bought for you somewhere else.
[02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:02.050]  But why not just wear a Molon Labe?
[02:36:02.050 --> 02:36:03.751]  The left can't even read, don't even know Latin.
[02:36:03.751 --> 02:36:05.392]  You'll just get friends with that.
[02:36:05.392 --> 02:36:07.152]  Or George Washington's shirt.
[02:36:07.152 --> 02:36:08.173]  Or mean like a Wolverine.
[02:36:10.543 --> 02:36:16.988]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[02:36:16.988 --> 02:36:18.449]  And we got Doug Hagman coming up.
[02:36:18.449 --> 02:36:21.951]  We'll go in a little bit in the next hour as this press conference comes up if you need more time.
[02:36:21.951 --> 02:36:26.374]  Because this is really important, and I saw this go really, really viral too.
[02:36:26.374 --> 02:36:28.196]  I was aware of the Restart Movement.
[02:36:28.196 --> 02:36:33.559]  I was aware that something like half the population is below the age of 25 in Iran.
[02:36:33.559 --> 02:36:35.161]  The Mullahs are very unpopular.
[02:36:35.161 --> 02:36:36.682]  It didn't even used to be an Islamic country.
[02:36:37.947 --> 02:36:39.008]  They want to modernize.
[02:36:39.008 --> 02:36:42.130]  They were building nuclear reactors before the Shah was taken out.
[02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:44.632]  And so, what's really happened to Iran?
[02:36:44.632 --> 02:36:49.696]  Why did the CIA and others actually help put the Mullahs into power, the leftist CIA?
[02:36:49.696 --> 02:36:50.977]  And how could this change?
[02:36:50.977 --> 02:36:54.961]  So, what started it all was spies and sleeper cells to look into the Iranian threat.
[02:36:55.601 --> 02:36:59.142]  That you covered a while back, I'd also covered it, before even mainstream news did.
[02:36:59.142 --> 02:37:07.084]  And then get us into Restart, this big exclusive interview that's on Infowars.com that we're going to post to the top of the page right now so folks can find the whole interview.
[02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:08.845]  We're going to play some excerption.
[02:37:08.845 --> 02:37:15.067]  Tell us about how you went to California to interview the leader who is the main opposition group.
[02:37:15.067 --> 02:37:20.728]  Well it's interesting Alex, you said half the population is under 28 and the Restart movement is very young.
[02:37:20.728 --> 02:37:23.029]  It's pretty much made up of
[02:37:24.252 --> 02:37:29.417]  Young people and women, lots of women doing a lot of courageous things under the regime.
[02:37:29.417 --> 02:37:38.145]  And they reached out to me after that article and said they're being censored for two years and no one's reporting on them, the mainstream media is ignoring them.
[02:37:38.145 --> 02:37:45.932]  And so we responded and I ended up calling the leader and Syed Mohammed and we spoke and I was very
[02:37:47.179 --> 02:37:47.519]  Thank you.
[02:38:05.498 --> 02:38:10.100]  More like Christianity going inward, cleansing the self, working on the self, accepting and loving others.
[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:19.104]  The point is they want a free, open country, they want a modern industrialization, and they don't want the religious dictatorship of the Shiite mullahs.
[02:38:19.104 --> 02:38:21.005]  True, and they're also worried about Reza Pahlavi.
[02:38:21.005 --> 02:38:22.486]  They're worried that Reza Pahlavi is...
[02:38:23.326 --> 02:38:24.848]  Owned by England and Russia.
[02:38:24.848 --> 02:38:27.230]  And they're sick of being under the thumb of England and Russia.
[02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:32.175]  They even come out and say in the interview that they want a 1776 to finally be free from England and Russia.
[02:38:32.175 --> 02:38:32.456]  That's right.
[02:38:32.456 --> 02:38:33.176]  Anglo-American oil.
[02:38:33.176 --> 02:38:34.678]  The British Empire ran them.
[02:38:34.678 --> 02:38:42.086]  Then when they kicked them out, even though they were being pro-America, they sent in Kermit Roosevelt and others with Operation Ajax to overthrow Mohammed Mozedek.
[02:38:42.086 --> 02:38:43.227]  So it's the same story over and over again.
[02:38:43.487 --> 02:38:45.149]  Yes, that's how they feel and they're sick of it.
[02:38:45.149 --> 02:38:45.950]  They want independence.
[02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:46.631]  They want freedom.
[02:38:46.631 --> 02:38:57.463]  Because they were always a wealthy, secular country with the women going to college and fashion and science and now we've put them under the worst Islamic rule.
[02:38:57.463 --> 02:38:58.284]  Yes.
[02:38:58.284 --> 02:39:03.069]  A lot of people even suggest that Thomas Jefferson was very inspired by Cyrus the Great when he was drafting the Constitution.
[02:39:03.069 --> 02:39:03.890]  When you compare the two,
[02:39:04.531 --> 02:39:05.252]  They're very similar.
[02:39:05.252 --> 02:39:12.236]  The best thing that we have that Cyrus the Great didn't, I think, is that ours is protected by God, so it can't be taken away.
[02:39:12.236 --> 02:39:16.338]  And we have the right to bear arms, which is what he gets to talk about in the interview, which is also very interesting.
[02:39:16.338 --> 02:39:20.701]  But this is, I mean, this is like the first or second, it's one of the top opposition groups.
[02:39:21.101 --> 02:39:24.522]  Well, I would say it is the leading opposition group, but they're the only ones being censored.
[02:39:24.522 --> 02:39:34.266]  I've been flooded by thousands of tweets and contacts from this movement, and I've only heard one from someone from Reza Pahlavi and the Mujahideen.
[02:39:34.266 --> 02:39:37.107]  I don't think anyone really cares for the Mujahideen except radical Islam.
[02:39:37.107 --> 02:39:37.627]  Exactly.
[02:39:37.627 --> 02:39:43.809]  So what's happening is the same old global power brokers want to overthrow the Iranian mullahs, but put something
[02:39:45.453 --> 02:39:46.334]  Another globalist thing.
[02:39:46.334 --> 02:39:47.555]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:39:47.555 --> 02:39:48.416]  And they're nationalists.
[02:39:48.416 --> 02:39:51.719]  And it's just like Trump said, we stand with nationalists, not globalists.
[02:39:51.719 --> 02:39:52.860]  And that's exactly what they are.
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:54.742]  They are completely behind Trump.
[02:39:54.742 --> 02:39:58.406]  And they, I would say their language about Trump, they sound just like us.
[02:39:58.406 --> 02:39:59.507]  They sound like American patriots.
[02:39:59.507 --> 02:40:02.550]  They sound like they understand the whole movement that Trump is behind.
[02:40:02.850 --> 02:40:11.273]  Well, because Iran wasn't like this until the last, really, 80 years or so, and then there's been a battle with Islam coming in, trying to take over, and then the Shah, and all those problems.
[02:40:11.273 --> 02:40:20.356]  We're going to cover all that coming up today, but right now, let's go to this press conference with Senator Grassley and others with a big announcement.
[02:40:20.356 --> 02:40:29.939]  Here is that announcement right now, and we'll come back, obviously, from break, and we'll cover more of this, and we'll get to all these amazing clips with the leader of the real only opposition group for research.
[02:40:31.079 --> 02:40:42.205]  What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.
[02:40:42.205 --> 02:40:50.050]  And the second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats.
[02:40:50.934 --> 02:41:01.163]  They've always got a reason why the goal posts need to be moved further down the field, farther down the field, and nothing we could do would satisfy them.
[02:41:01.163 --> 02:41:02.825]  They're dug in.
[02:41:02.825 --> 02:41:05.687]  You've seen it from the beginning.
[02:41:05.687 --> 02:41:12.233]  And with that, I want to turn it over to Chairman Grassley and the members of the committee who I think have done a really outstanding job.
[02:41:12.233 --> 02:41:13.575]  Thank you, Mr. Leader.
[02:41:16.565 --> 02:41:32.876]  Before I say a few words, so I won't have to announce each person after me, in this order will be Hatch, Cornyn, Lee and Tillis, so please just come to the podium and say whatever you want to say and then we'll take questions.
[02:41:32.876 --> 02:41:36.058]  This is the 87th day.
[02:41:36.058 --> 02:41:42.803]  That's three weeks longer than the average of the last three or four nominees to the Supreme Court.
[02:41:43.999 --> 02:41:47.900]  So don't tell me you haven't spent enough time.
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:51.642]  Also, I feel very good about where this nomination is right now.
[02:41:51.642 --> 02:41:56.103]  Now, I don't say that from the standpoint of county votes.
[02:41:56.103 --> 02:42:03.526]  I say that from the standpoint of the qualifications of this candidate and the fact that those qualifications
[02:42:04.815 --> 02:42:10.258]  To be a Supreme Court Justice based upon his 12 years on the D.C.
[02:42:10.258 --> 02:42:17.423]  Circuit without anybody finding any fault with his qualifications to serve there?
[02:42:17.423 --> 02:42:19.644]  But that hasn't been talked about much.
[02:42:19.644 --> 02:42:20.385]  Everything else.
[02:42:22.096 --> 02:42:24.217]  This person is very well qualified.
[02:42:39.125 --> 02:42:40.966]  Because like you said, mainstream media wants to ignore this.
[02:42:40.966 --> 02:42:42.607]  They don't want to hear about the real Iranian opposition.
[02:42:42.607 --> 02:42:46.510]  If you really want to topple the mullahs, you've got to talk to the real opposition.
[02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:48.011]  Infowars.com.
[02:42:48.011 --> 02:42:49.392]  Newswars.com.
[02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:51.753]  Tim Cook and the shycoms think you're stupid.
[02:42:51.753 --> 02:42:53.194]  They think you don't care if we get shut down.
[02:42:53.194 --> 02:42:54.095]  I think different.
[02:42:56.454 --> 02:43:04.978]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.
[02:43:04.978 --> 02:43:08.479]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[02:43:25.427 --> 02:43:29.009]  Best selling product at Infowarslife.com because it works so well.

[02:43:55.044 --> 02:43:58.972]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:09.013]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:09.013 --> 02:44:10.994]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:10.994 --> 02:44:14.455]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.455 --> 02:44:17.056]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.056 --> 02:44:19.357]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.357 --> 02:44:26.300]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:36.647]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:36.647 --> 02:44:37.848]  We'll win.
[02:44:37.848 --> 02:44:40.730]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:47.896]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[02:44:47.896 --> 02:44:51.579]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:44:51.579 --> 02:44:53.160]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:54.020]  We need your support.
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:54.561]  I'm counting on you.
[02:44:55.908 --> 02:44:55.928]  X2.
[02:45:26.508 --> 02:45:31.649]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[02:45:31.649 --> 02:45:33.390]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:34.630]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:38.991]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:38.991 --> 02:45:44.272]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:45:44.272 --> 02:45:46.253]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[02:45:46.253 --> 02:45:48.973]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[02:45:48.973 --> 02:45:50.874]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[02:45:50.874 --> 02:45:52.254]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:45:52.254 --> 02:45:53.615]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[02:45:53.615 --> 02:45:55.195]  InfoWarshore.com right now.
[02:45:55.825 --> 02:46:00.669]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:46:59.759 --> 02:47:02.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:20.151 --> 02:47:25.793]  Well, even CNN's reporting what I was saying last weekend.
[02:47:25.793 --> 02:47:31.834]  Republicans needed a midterm miracle.
[02:47:40.043 --> 02:47:42.064]  Well, at least the Democrats thought that.
[02:47:42.064 --> 02:47:46.705]  And Brett Kavanaugh's persecution, the witch hunt against him, is it.
[02:47:46.705 --> 02:47:55.567]  It's showing that it's energizing voters, waking people up, and it's turning one of the undecided voters and first-time voters against the Democrats.
[02:47:55.567 --> 02:47:59.788]  Which means your giant, ridiculous witch hunt has had the wheels come off of it.
[02:47:59.788 --> 02:48:01.469]  And we're playing part of this press conference.
[02:48:01.469 --> 02:48:05.450]  I can tell you Grassley says they intend to confirm him on Saturday.
[02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:06.510]  They think they have the votes.
[02:48:07.711 --> 02:48:12.733]  And just everything that Ford and others have said has turned out to not be true.
[02:48:12.733 --> 02:48:15.193]  The FBI investigation has said no cooperation.
[02:48:15.193 --> 02:48:18.834]  Let's hear a few minutes of this.
[02:48:18.834 --> 02:48:27.057]  The qualifications to be a Supreme Court justice based upon his 12 years on the D.C.
[02:48:27.057 --> 02:48:34.199]  Circuit without anybody finding any fault with his qualifications to serve there.
[02:48:34.199 --> 02:48:36.420]  But that hasn't been talked about much.
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:37.160]  Everything else.
[02:48:38.871 --> 02:48:40.852]  This person is very well qualified.
[02:48:40.852 --> 02:48:42.173]  It's like you have no criminal record or anything wrong.
[02:48:42.173 --> 02:48:44.735]  The person that brings in the principles of due process.
[02:48:44.735 --> 02:48:45.315]  There's no proof.
[02:48:45.315 --> 02:48:49.838]  The presumption of innocence and readiness to serve are recognized.
[02:48:49.838 --> 02:48:56.263]  So Judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed on Saturday.
[02:48:56.263 --> 02:49:05.229]  Now, this started downhill very quickly on about July the 10th when Schumer said,
[02:49:06.897 --> 02:49:11.938]  That we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination.
[02:49:11.938 --> 02:49:21.480]  And you can look back 87 days, and you can see that everything, whether he's qualified to serve, has been brought up.
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:23.861]  Brought up.
[02:49:23.861 --> 02:49:30.262]  I've tried to commit, and I think I've carried out, what I promised immediately.
[02:49:31.263 --> 02:49:35.766]  That we want to have a fair and thorough process.
[02:49:35.766 --> 02:49:39.768]  We have had a fair and thorough process.
[02:49:39.768 --> 02:49:53.255]  And I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we, the minute I read about who the person was in the Feinstein letter, Dr. Ford, I read about her name in the paper.
[02:49:53.255 --> 02:49:57.417]  We got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted.
[02:49:57.417 --> 02:49:59.819]  And in turn, we provided the same forum
[02:50:00.745 --> 02:50:05.329]  For two years they've been trying to get someone in the American media to interview their leader.
[02:50:28.667 --> 02:50:50.398]  Sayyed Mohamed Hosseini and so they were actually tweeting out his phone number in many many ways and we were actually the first ones to do it and so we called him and we set up an interview and we met him in Anaheim, California where we met him and some friends of his and we had another person there helping to translate for us and it was actually quite amazing.
[02:50:50.398 --> 02:50:54.800]  His answers kind of blew my mind and he spoke like an American patriot and
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:05.904]  And then shortly after that I heard President Trump's speech at the UN talking about nationalists, not globalists, and make America great is suddenly making a lot more sense to me.
[02:51:05.904 --> 02:51:08.165]  I think it's 1776 worldwide.
[02:51:08.165 --> 02:51:09.565]  I think that's it.
[02:51:09.565 --> 02:51:10.626]  And he says that too, doesn't he?
[02:51:10.626 --> 02:51:11.186]  He says that, yeah.
[02:51:12.346 --> 02:51:13.927]  Well, I mean, I've heard of the Restart Movement.
[02:51:13.927 --> 02:51:17.610]  They just want a modernized, regular, secular country.
[02:51:17.610 --> 02:51:22.433]  And the polls show, like you said, half the public population is under the age of 28.
[02:51:22.433 --> 02:51:27.416]  Yeah, and they're fed up with radical Islam, because that's not who they are.
[02:51:27.416 --> 02:51:30.678]  And they know that the world thinks that that's who they are.
[02:51:30.678 --> 02:51:37.503]  And when I asked them a question about radical Islam, when I was editing it, I noticed there was almost like hurt feelings, like they're sick of that.
[02:51:37.503 --> 02:51:40.044]  They're sick of people thinking that they're that, and they're not.
[02:51:40.044 --> 02:51:41.185]  Well, that's what runs their country.
[02:51:41.185 --> 02:51:41.966]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:51:43.147 --> 02:51:45.008]  Let's go to this first clip here.
[02:51:45.008 --> 02:51:50.953]  This is where they talk about President Trump and they talk about the parallels there.
[02:51:50.953 --> 02:51:53.014]  Then we'll get into their view on the Second Amendment.
[02:51:53.014 --> 02:51:55.236]  But this is just a view into the world.
[02:51:55.236 --> 02:51:56.697]  Here it is.
[02:51:56.697 --> 02:52:02.302]  What does Restart think of President Donald Trump?
[02:52:02.302 --> 02:52:09.827]  My response to your question is something I'd like to say to the American people.
[02:52:20.085 --> 02:52:30.012]  The American people must know that before Trump became president, he already had fame and money.
[02:52:30.012 --> 02:52:36.417]  So he is not after these two things.
[02:52:36.417 --> 02:52:39.840]  He wants to make America great and has only one request.
[02:52:42.168 --> 02:52:46.809]  He wants the people to show love.
[02:52:46.809 --> 02:52:52.470]  And Restart knows how hard it was for him to get elected.
[02:52:52.470 --> 02:52:57.611]  Because every media and every leader did not want him to win.
[02:52:57.611 --> 02:53:04.112]  And we knew when this man became president that two things would happen.
[02:53:12.111 --> 02:53:18.296]  The first thing is that the leaders of the world would now have to speak with their heads, not with money.
[02:53:18.296 --> 02:53:30.023]  The second is that turmoil would happen between leaders because Trump would expose them and their lies.
[02:53:36.363 --> 02:53:40.385]  So I repeat, Trump is not after money or fame.
[02:53:40.385 --> 02:53:47.367]  He wants his name to be remembered.
[02:53:47.367 --> 02:53:54.969]  And for his name to be remembered, he has to say what he sees so that the people will trust him.
[02:53:54.969 --> 02:54:00.071]  And if he was dishonest, everything you see happening now would not have happened.
[02:54:01.641 --> 02:54:02.502]  I mean, we should get him.
[02:54:02.502 --> 02:54:03.483]  Hit pause right there.
[02:54:03.483 --> 02:54:04.924]  This guy makes perfect sense.
[02:54:04.924 --> 02:54:06.346]  Because Trump's real.
[02:54:06.346 --> 02:54:07.086]  That's what I always said.
[02:54:07.086 --> 02:54:07.687]  Trump's real.
[02:54:07.687 --> 02:54:09.529]  His name's destroyed if he doesn't deliver.
[02:54:09.529 --> 02:54:09.909]  Yeah.
[02:54:09.909 --> 02:54:11.210]  And he's going to be physically destroyed.
[02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:14.133]  And the enemy's coming after him because they know it's real.
[02:54:14.133 --> 02:54:14.674]  Yeah.
[02:54:14.674 --> 02:54:15.875]  That doesn't mean he's God.
[02:54:15.875 --> 02:54:16.836]  Doesn't mean he can do everything right.
[02:54:16.836 --> 02:54:18.658]  But this guy totally gets it.
[02:54:18.658 --> 02:54:19.919]  Trump is totally committed.
[02:54:19.919 --> 02:54:22.001]  And if he wasn't real, you wouldn't be seeing this.
[02:54:22.001 --> 02:54:22.561]  No.
[02:54:22.561 --> 02:54:23.102]  Let's continue.
[02:54:25.444 --> 02:54:31.246]  And for his name to be remembered, he has to say what he sees so that the people will trust him.
[02:54:31.246 --> 02:54:39.708]  And if he was dishonest, everything you see happening now would not have happened.
[02:54:39.708 --> 02:54:43.309]  Everyone wants to bring him down because they do not want the truth to be exposed.
[02:54:53.388 --> 02:55:02.250]  I've told my people to only trust President Trump and Pompeo.
[02:55:02.250 --> 02:55:08.111]  And we believe that Trump is doing something that will destroy the Iranian regime.
[02:55:08.111 --> 02:55:14.713]  And millions of restart people believe this.
[02:55:14.713 --> 02:55:18.614]  I have told the people that President Trump is like Ronaldo, the famous soccer player.
[02:55:21.381 --> 02:55:27.627]  He looks one way, but shoots the other.
[02:55:27.627 --> 02:55:32.191]  To understand what Trump is doing, we must look at the score.
[02:55:32.191 --> 02:55:36.414]  How many goals he has scored.
[02:55:36.414 --> 02:55:39.877]  One of his goals was North Korea.
[02:55:39.877 --> 02:55:42.379]  Second goal was the embargo on Iran.
[02:55:42.379 --> 02:55:43.761]  Now the government is scared.
[02:55:47.261 --> 02:55:58.245]  Third goal, getting close to Russia and to get Iran away from its claws.
[02:55:58.245 --> 02:56:01.866]  Fourth goal, was getting countries to pay America fairly.
[02:56:01.866 --> 02:56:07.028]  There are many other goals that I could talk about.
[02:56:12.045 --> 02:56:15.909]  So this shows how Trump and the nationalist movement all over the world is exploding.
[02:56:15.909 --> 02:56:17.251]  I've known about Restart for years.
[02:56:17.251 --> 02:56:17.912]  Very exciting.
[02:56:17.912 --> 02:56:23.698]  I know it's one of the, in the top two groups, like you said, the other group is backed by the British and the globalists, and we don't want that.
[02:56:23.698 --> 02:56:26.301]  But obviously, anything's better than Mullahs at this point.
[02:56:26.301 --> 02:56:27.422]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:56:27.422 --> 02:56:33.429]  I would have thought before my research that Reza Pahlavi was a good option, because like you say, in the 70s it was really good.
[02:56:34.029 --> 02:56:37.670]  But everyone's telling me that they just want freedom, and that's globalist.
[02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:55.937]  And it's interesting, there's a group now called Farage Guard, and just appeared September for the first time out of nowhere, and they are the new opposition that the mainstream media is pushing, and it's really only made up of 40 people, all exiles, and they are claiming that the only solution is to get Reza Pahlavi in there, and it just stinks of a globalist setup.
[02:56:56.423 --> 02:56:58.484]  All right, well, big news with Iran.
[02:56:58.484 --> 02:56:59.544]  More of these clips coming up.
[02:56:59.544 --> 02:57:00.865]  And here's the even bigger news.
[02:57:00.865 --> 02:57:02.905]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:57:02.905 --> 02:57:11.729]  Vice President Pence came out against Google moving to China and said it's treason and said they've got to stop all activities now.
[02:57:11.729 --> 02:57:14.030]  And folks, of course it's treason.
[02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:15.610]  What Apple's doing.
[02:57:15.610 --> 02:57:16.330]  What Google's doing.
[02:57:16.330 --> 02:57:17.651]  They're not just moving there.
[02:57:17.651 --> 02:57:22.113]  They're working with SpyTech Against America to censor and helping set up these systems.
[02:57:22.113 --> 02:57:22.733]  That video
[02:57:24.221 --> 02:57:25.102]  It's coming up as well.
[02:57:25.102 --> 02:57:27.424]  Remember, you didn't hear about any of this three months ago.
[02:57:27.424 --> 02:57:30.748]  But you, this powerful audience, put it on the map.
[02:57:30.748 --> 02:57:33.511]  Now I'm being attacked for it, but that's okay.
[02:57:33.511 --> 02:57:35.232]  That's what we're here for, to fight.
[02:57:35.232 --> 02:57:36.694]  We're men, remember?
[02:57:36.694 --> 02:57:38.636]  We gotta do what's right no matter what happens.
[02:57:38.636 --> 02:57:40.658]  But we're seeing fruit in our lifetimes.
[02:57:40.658 --> 02:57:41.999]  Most patriots never see that.
[02:57:45.157 --> 02:57:53.680]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:55.140]  Believe me, I know.
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:59.842]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:57:59.842 --> 02:58:02.923]  But thanks to super male vitality at inputwarestore.com,
[02:58:03.403 --> 02:58:05.085]  I still have that energy.
[02:58:05.085 --> 02:58:25.243]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:58:25.743 --> 02:58:29.725]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:58:53.919 --> 02:58:54.400]  It's you.
[02:58:55.481 --> 02:58:57.663]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:58:57.663 --> 02:59:06.392]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.392 --> 02:59:10.977]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:10.977 --> 02:59:12.418]  You are the info war.
[02:59:12.418 --> 02:59:15.962]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.622 --> 02:59:28.010]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:45.782]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:59:49.259 --> 02:59:55.242]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.242 --> 02:59:58.443]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:59:58.443 --> 03:00:03.646]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.646 --> 03:00:04.746]  We rode a blazing
[03:00:19.973 --> 03:00:26.418]  I said this is an intro like 10 years ago.
[03:00:26.418 --> 03:00:27.379]  I'm glad they brought it back.
[03:00:27.379 --> 03:00:28.420]  They must have done a new one though.
[03:00:31.026 --> 03:00:36.208]  Alright, we're here talking to Greg Reese about his restart interview with the leader of the main Iranian opposition.
[03:00:36.208 --> 03:00:40.790]  You don't get this on other shows, obviously, because that's the type of stuff we cover.
[03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:43.532]  And I want to get into this huge announcement that's on Infowars.com.
[03:00:43.532 --> 03:00:45.592]  They're printing the article right now.
[03:00:45.592 --> 03:00:46.913]  Video's coming up.
[03:00:46.913 --> 03:00:50.374]  That is the Vice President calling Google out for treason.
[03:00:50.374 --> 03:00:51.375]  So, wow!
[03:00:51.375 --> 03:00:52.815]  Nobody was talking about this a few months ago.
[03:00:52.815 --> 03:00:53.556]  Now everybody is.
[03:00:54.537 --> 03:00:56.179]  That's why they want to shut down.
[03:00:56.179 --> 03:00:57.380]  And let's go to this next clip.
[03:00:57.380 --> 03:00:58.901]  There's so many of these clips.
[03:00:58.901 --> 03:01:01.964]  Infowars breaks the censorship window.
[03:01:01.964 --> 03:01:05.127]  They model themselves after Cyrus and this empire.
[03:01:05.127 --> 03:01:13.835]  Kind of the ethos of Iran, kind of like George Washington's ours, or Roland is French, or Arthur is British, explained.
[03:01:15.937 --> 03:01:26.835]  Mythos, or the, kind of like the Jewish people, you know, you would say that it would be somebody like Abraham, or it would be somebody like Moses.
[03:01:26.835 --> 03:01:27.756]  Tell us about Cyrus.
[03:01:28.993 --> 03:01:53.431]  In my research in the last video I did about the history of Persia, Cyrus the Great came after the fall of Babylon, was the founder of the first Persian dynasty, and what he's known for mostly is he created something very similar to what we have in America as far as civil rights for people, where people were allowed to practice whatever religion they wanted, they were allowed to keep their languages and keep their cultures.
[03:01:54.671 --> 03:02:09.237]  I believe the Bible talks a bit about Cyrus and the Jews loved him for this because he was very open and accepting as opposed to the caliphate which wants to put everyone under Islamic rule and in Persia it's been basically the two things back and forth it's been the ideas of Cyrus which is freedom of the individual
[03:02:10.114 --> 03:02:15.076]  And then collectivism, or whatever you want to call radical Islam, a brute brutality.
[03:02:15.076 --> 03:02:19.218]  And it's a restart, is modeling self after that ancient renaissance.
[03:02:19.218 --> 03:02:20.999]  That, and the American Constitution.
[03:02:20.999 --> 03:02:27.282]  They're very clear that they want a first and second amendment, and then they want a base, yes, a combination of the both.
[03:02:27.282 --> 03:02:28.903]  Cyrus the Great and the US Constitution.
[03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:36.840]  Well that sounds like a good opposition group, and like, again, I've followed some of what happens in Iran, I've known about Restart for years, but like you said, it never gets attention.
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:37.341]  No.
[03:02:37.341 --> 03:02:44.091]  They're completely censored, whereas Faraj Guard and the Mujahideen are being talked about in the mainstream media as if they're the only two options.
[03:02:46.209 --> 03:02:47.871]  And Mujahideen's just another radical Islam.
[03:02:47.871 --> 03:02:48.491]  Absolutely.
[03:02:48.491 --> 03:02:50.753]  There's nothing appealing to them, to anyone.
[03:02:50.753 --> 03:02:52.475]  And the other group's kind of like a Soros thing.
[03:02:52.475 --> 03:02:58.940]  The other group completely appears like a globalist setup to just put Russia and England back in power, or keep them in power.
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:02:59.261]  Whichever.
[03:03:00.413 --> 03:03:04.076]  And they've never known freedom, I guess, except for maybe a thousand years ago.
[03:03:04.076 --> 03:03:05.518]  You know, back in the days of Cyrus the Great.
[03:03:05.518 --> 03:03:07.880]  And they want freedom, just like every person.
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:08.600]  Yeah, how long?
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:10.923]  And none of it against Russia, but it's right on their borders, so you get why.
[03:03:10.923 --> 03:03:14.326]  But going back to Tsarist, a couple hundred years, Russia was kind of dominating.
[03:03:14.326 --> 03:03:15.727]  Then the Brits came in.
[03:03:15.727 --> 03:03:16.568]  Yeah.
[03:03:16.568 --> 03:03:18.029]  And I would imagine it's oil.
[03:03:18.029 --> 03:03:21.272]  You know, that's been the game in there for a long time, is to take their resources.
[03:03:21.272 --> 03:03:23.774]  But why shouldn't they be able to control their own resources?
[03:03:23.774 --> 03:03:25.115]  Well, they ought to just sell them to everybody.
[03:03:25.115 --> 03:03:25.295]  Yes.
[03:03:26.161 --> 03:03:27.082]  Yeah.
[03:03:27.082 --> 03:03:28.142]  Well, we'll see what happens.
[03:03:28.142 --> 03:03:30.384]  I want to go out to break with this clip.
[03:03:30.384 --> 03:03:35.807]  Well, we're going to come back with what is Cyrus Empire will look like, a radical Islam clip, refugee crisis.
[03:03:35.807 --> 03:03:36.507]  These are really great.
[03:03:36.507 --> 03:03:40.810]  But the full interview is now on InfoWars.com.
[03:03:40.810 --> 03:03:42.110]  And I forget the exact title.
[03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:44.452]  We can pull it up like Meet the Donald Trump of Iran.
[03:03:44.452 --> 03:03:45.012]  That's right.
[03:03:45.012 --> 03:03:46.113]  Meet the Donald Trump of Iran.
[03:03:46.713 --> 03:03:47.474]  There it is, full interview.
[03:03:47.474 --> 03:03:54.220]  Mikhail Donald Trump of Iran, whose movement has a shot of reviving the Persian nation.
[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:59.304]  I think my headline was, as we didn't go with it, is, whose movement has a shot at making Iran great again.
[03:03:59.304 --> 03:04:01.666]  Yes, and that is, they are using that logo.
[03:04:01.666 --> 03:04:03.308]  If you go on Twitter, you'll see that everywhere.
[03:04:03.308 --> 03:04:04.649]  MIGA, Make Iran Great Again.
[03:04:05.848 --> 03:04:14.615]  That's what really first caught my eye about it, because... Well, how can you be run by globalists, or by some party, and then not have your... I mean, of course your nation's not going to be great.
[03:04:14.615 --> 03:04:14.755]  Right.
[03:04:14.755 --> 03:04:20.520]  The nation has to be run by the people, its values, its culture, and then projecting out with their vision and their plan.
[03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:22.501]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:04:22.501 --> 03:04:27.685]  Because if you don't have a nation state, and you don't have some type of ethos or myth, then you have nothing.
[03:04:27.685 --> 03:04:28.586]  Absolutely.
[03:04:28.586 --> 03:04:34.751]  I would even say it all starts with the family, and then from the family, the community, and if we can't control our own families and our own community, then we are not free.
[03:04:36.736 --> 03:04:37.638]  That's what I'm fighting for.
[03:04:54.246 --> 03:04:58.190]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.190 --> 03:05:01.492]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.492 --> 03:05:07.758]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.758 --> 03:05:10.541]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.261 --> 03:05:15.085]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.085 --> 03:05:21.552]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.552 --> 03:05:26.537]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.270 --> 03:05:31.192]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.192 --> 03:05:38.396]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.396 --> 03:05:43.098]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.098 --> 03:05:49.302]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.302 --> 03:05:53.284]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:05:57.819 --> 03:06:02.786]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:16.369 --> 03:06:18.070]  Greg Reese is our guest coming up.
[03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:19.371]  Doug Hagman takes over.
[03:06:19.371 --> 03:06:21.932]  Huge news on the free speech front.
[03:06:21.932 --> 03:06:26.154]  In fact, will you guys bring me that article in that's from Infowars.com?
[03:06:26.154 --> 03:06:27.135]  I know I printed it during the break.
[03:06:27.135 --> 03:06:27.735]  I forgot to get it.
[03:06:27.735 --> 03:06:29.236]  I'm sorry I did that.
[03:06:29.236 --> 03:06:30.797]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[03:06:30.797 --> 03:06:32.177]  It's a pretty big deal.
[03:06:32.177 --> 03:06:34.579]  The vice president has come out.
[03:06:35.539 --> 03:06:42.741]  And said that we need to stop Google working with the shycoms on drag-and-fly to censor their people and this whole AI system.
[03:06:42.741 --> 03:06:46.603]  But you have Facebook announcing they're merging with Google in China.
[03:06:46.603 --> 03:06:57.926]  So it looks like the stampede to China and authoritarianism, where the globalists don't make them pay any taxes, really has begun in a big, big way.
[03:06:57.926 --> 03:07:02.268]  But for stations that just joined us, Greg, go ahead and
[03:07:03.709 --> 03:07:08.892]  Recap about the Iranian main opposition group.
[03:07:08.892 --> 03:07:21.298]  So for two years, the group Restart has been censored from the mainstream media, while the Faraj Guard, which is pretty much Reza Pahlavi, and the Mujahideen have been offered by the mainstream media as the only two options.
[03:07:21.298 --> 03:07:23.860]  And the reason that's important is Iran's always a global crisis.
[03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:25.501]  You're going to the whole history.
[03:07:25.501 --> 03:07:40.350]  Globalist forces helped put Ayatollah Khomeini in, that's been documented, and actually removed the Shah because he was going the way, again even though he'd been a puppet at first, he was going the way of Mozart actually trying to give the money and power to the people again out of national pride.
[03:07:40.350 --> 03:07:40.830]  Yeah.
[03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:42.871]  And we want the Persians to be great again.
[03:07:42.871 --> 03:07:44.952]  So we're really going back to that same point yet again.
[03:07:44.952 --> 03:07:45.393]  Absolutely.
[03:07:45.993 --> 03:07:57.518]  And my research shows me that Reza Pahlavi's father was actually taking down the Sufi churches and elevating the mullahs, as if he was setting up the 79 revolution.
[03:07:57.518 --> 03:08:05.222]  Because he was strengthening all the mullahs and weakening the Sufi churches, which is the more passive and peaceful and loving churches of Islam over there.
[03:08:05.222 --> 03:08:06.482]  That's right, the more tolerant ones.
[03:08:06.482 --> 03:08:07.443]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:08:07.443 --> 03:08:12.345]  Which is exactly what Cyrus the Great's empire claims that they want, is to be tolerant,
[03:08:13.280 --> 03:08:23.123]  And to be open to all cultures and allow the person to pursue their own heart, which is really what I think every American wants.
[03:08:23.123 --> 03:08:24.924]  So it's a very libertarian, renaissance-based system.
[03:08:24.924 --> 03:08:25.364]  Absolutely.
[03:08:25.364 --> 03:08:26.304]  Let's play a few more of these clips.
[03:08:26.304 --> 03:08:27.725]  The full interview is on Infowars.com.
[03:08:27.725 --> 03:08:28.685]  Folks, you really should share it.
[03:08:28.685 --> 03:08:29.425]  They don't want to get out there.
[03:08:29.425 --> 03:08:30.505]  Doug Agnew is coming up.
[03:08:30.505 --> 03:08:32.066]  Here's just a few minutes.
[03:08:32.066 --> 03:08:35.087]  Right now, let's go to what the Cyrus Empire would look like.
[03:08:35.087 --> 03:08:36.327]  Here it is.
[03:08:36.327 --> 03:08:41.409]  Your plan is to have democratic elections with at least five different political parties to choose from.
[03:08:42.443 --> 03:08:46.546]  Do you plan on taking a leadership role until there are elections?
[03:08:46.546 --> 03:08:47.267]  How does this work?
[03:08:47.267 --> 03:08:49.228]  I want to turn it upside down.
[03:08:49.228 --> 03:08:52.431]  I want to give them a 1776.
[03:08:52.431 --> 03:08:55.393]  I want to bring a 4th of July so that Iran is free from British and Russian control.
[03:09:18.604 --> 03:09:26.426]  I want to draft a new constitution, influenced by Cyrus the Great.
[03:09:26.426 --> 03:09:32.187]  Then, I want to introduce 10 to 15 different parties to the people of Iran, so that they can choose.
[03:09:32.187 --> 03:09:34.948]  Now hit pause real quick.
[03:09:34.948 --> 03:09:36.268]  Also, I mean, study the whole history of this.
[03:09:36.268 --> 03:09:39.409]  Nothing against Islam, all the rest of it, but, you know, they invaded in the last 500, 600 years.
[03:09:41.365 --> 03:09:42.826]  This guy looks Iranian.
[03:09:42.826 --> 03:09:43.988]  He looks Persian.
[03:09:43.988 --> 03:09:48.372]  If you look at the Shiites, they're all literally related to Muhammad.
[03:09:48.372 --> 03:09:50.614]  They're from the Middle East.
[03:09:50.614 --> 03:09:52.616]  So it's like it's an outside group.
[03:09:52.616 --> 03:09:53.456]  It's a royalty.
[03:09:53.456 --> 03:09:54.537]  The Caliphate, I would say.
[03:09:54.537 --> 03:09:57.460]  It's a royal Islamic... Because again, people don't know.
[03:09:57.460 --> 03:09:59.342]  If you're a Shiite, you've got to be related to Muhammad.
[03:09:59.342 --> 03:09:59.842]  Yeah.
[03:09:59.842 --> 03:10:01.284]  So they probably all look the same.
[03:10:01.284 --> 03:10:01.404]  Yeah.
[03:10:03.549 --> 03:10:04.850]  They're not even Iranian!
[03:10:04.850 --> 03:10:05.570]  Right, exactly.
[03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:07.991]  Can you imagine how much that pisses the Iranians off?
[03:10:07.991 --> 03:10:08.931]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:10:08.931 --> 03:10:17.335]  You can see it in his face in the interview, the passion and the anger that he has, that his people have been taken like this, unfairly.
[03:10:17.335 --> 03:10:19.116]  Well, let's continue.
[03:10:19.116 --> 03:10:23.938]  The people will choose five of these parties to represent them.
[03:10:31.261 --> 03:10:41.964]  Next is to create a judicial system from the very beginning.
[03:10:41.964 --> 03:10:51.706]  If any of the parties disagree with any of the new laws, we will not succeed.
[03:10:51.706 --> 03:10:54.266]  For example, the right to bear arms.
[03:10:54.266 --> 03:10:56.987]  This is the first law under Cyrus the Great Empire.
[03:11:01.290 --> 03:11:10.358]  When Iran has the right to bear arms, the government can no longer disrespect the people.
[03:11:10.358 --> 03:11:14.702]  Now the government must lead with wisdom and knowledge, not with force and killing.
[03:11:14.702 --> 03:11:18.245]  If this doesn't happen, I will not return to Iran.
[03:11:18.245 --> 03:11:19.927]  They can go and do whatever the hell they want.
[03:11:26.525 --> 03:11:30.466]  Other oppositions are trying their best to keep this from happening.
[03:11:30.466 --> 03:11:34.327]  They don't want the Iranian people to have guns.
[03:11:34.327 --> 03:11:41.088]  They want to seize control of defenseless Iranian people and guide them towards the wrong path.
[03:11:41.088 --> 03:11:41.588]  Exactly.
[03:11:41.588 --> 03:11:43.109]  He's smart.
[03:11:43.109 --> 03:11:45.109]  The globalists have already primed it now.
[03:11:45.109 --> 03:11:47.029]  Remove it, bring in your Soros control.
[03:11:47.029 --> 03:11:48.570]  But that's perfect sense.
[03:11:48.570 --> 03:11:54.691]  You want all these diverse groups armed because then one gang group can't get centralized control.
[03:11:54.691 --> 03:11:54.831]  Yeah.
[03:11:55.663 --> 03:11:57.465]  And like you said, you go back over a thousand years ago.
[03:11:57.465 --> 03:11:58.866]  It was almost 2000.
[03:11:58.866 --> 03:12:03.209]  The Iranians were one of the first groups to put it in their law that everybody could have weapons.
[03:12:03.209 --> 03:12:04.190]  Absolutely.
[03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:08.774]  Well, I only have one person who's been contacting me from Iran who is against restart.
[03:12:08.774 --> 03:12:09.995]  And their argument was this.
[03:12:09.995 --> 03:12:12.818]  Their argument was we shouldn't have guns.
[03:12:12.818 --> 03:12:14.879]  Only through peace and love will we have freedom.
[03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:16.780]  But the government's going to have them.
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:17.200]  Right.
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:30.283]  And I think there are some American liberals who are into this idea too, that if we just lay down our guns and open our arms to the world, that everyone's going to just... That's like not locking your door at night, or when I'm peace and love, I'm going to leave my car running at the mall.
[03:12:30.283 --> 03:12:30.604]  Right.
[03:12:30.604 --> 03:12:31.664]  It's just not realistic.
[03:12:31.664 --> 03:12:34.084]  You're just living in la-la land if you think that's the case.
[03:12:34.084 --> 03:12:39.526]  Maybe when evil is completely eradicated from the world, which may never happen.
[03:12:39.526 --> 03:12:40.606]  Maybe then, but not now.
[03:12:41.485 --> 03:12:43.008]  Gregg Reese, great job with your report.
[03:12:43.008 --> 03:12:44.611]  The full report is on Infowars.com.
[03:12:44.611 --> 03:12:45.753]  It's powerful.
[03:12:45.753 --> 03:12:46.615]  Everyone should take it.
[03:12:46.615 --> 03:12:50.762]  Email it to everyone they know because we're trying to help other nation states as well.
[03:12:52.042 --> 03:12:56.926]  And it makes me excited, just like America getting freer, the UK getting freer, other countries pulling out of globalism.
[03:12:56.926 --> 03:12:57.767]  This is exciting.
[03:12:57.767 --> 03:12:58.107]  Yes.
[03:12:58.107 --> 03:13:00.429]  And they're really lucky to have a movement like this that's already in the lead.
[03:13:00.429 --> 03:13:01.389]  I think so.
[03:13:01.389 --> 03:13:02.150]  Obviously for real.
[03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.590]  Yeah.
[03:13:02.590 --> 03:13:03.151]  God bless you, man.
[03:13:03.151 --> 03:13:03.511]  Thank you, sir.
[03:13:03.511 --> 03:13:04.032]  Great job.
[03:13:04.032 --> 03:13:05.393]  Okay, we're going to come back.
[03:13:05.393 --> 03:13:09.296]  Doug Hagman with his other crew member is going to have big breaking news for you.
[03:13:09.296 --> 03:13:11.097]  I was told that's all coming up.
[03:13:11.097 --> 03:13:14.700]  Let me just say this now so I get out of their way and let them take over.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:15.521]  I am so excited.
[03:13:16.704 --> 03:13:18.566]  For the president, for the vice president.
[03:13:18.566 --> 03:13:27.374]  Because the central issue is the spy chips that Apple is allowing the Chinese government that runs their factories now to put in all the iPhones and other devices.
[03:13:27.374 --> 03:13:28.215]  This is treason.
[03:13:28.215 --> 03:13:29.616]  And it's the cover of Bloomberg right now.
[03:13:29.616 --> 03:13:30.577]  I've been telling you for years.
[03:13:30.577 --> 03:13:32.239]  It's why I was banned off the internet.
[03:13:33.059 --> 03:13:36.161]  But I've made this, and I'm not bragging, it's how you get stuff done, folks.
[03:13:36.161 --> 03:13:40.864]  We took one for the team, and let me tell you, if this wasn't big national news, I'd be depressed.
[03:13:40.864 --> 03:13:49.170]  But the fact that, yeah, they're pounding me hard and suing me and trying to shut me down and doing a lot of the stuff behind the scenes I won't get into on air for security reasons, but that's because I'm over the target.
[03:13:49.930 --> 03:13:55.854]  And so, Pence, Google should immediately end China's censorship project, Operation Dragonfly.
[03:13:55.854 --> 03:14:03.599]  And then he also gets into the AI, and how they're not working with America, that we built Google, by the way, but how they're working with the shycoms.
[03:14:03.599 --> 03:14:10.043]  The arrogance of Silicon Valley, they've been taking a little bit too much LSD here, folks.
[03:14:10.043 --> 03:14:18.048]  Because, you know, America may be a little slow on waking up, but once we do... So let's go in here for the Vice President.
[03:14:19.389 --> 03:14:28.036]  As we gather here, a new consensus on China is rising across America.
[03:14:28.036 --> 03:14:41.187]  More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving in to the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing's oppression.
[03:14:41.187 --> 03:14:43.850]  But more must follow suit.
[03:14:43.850 --> 03:14:47.573]  For example, Google should immediately end development
[03:14:48.422 --> 03:15:03.305]  of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen the Communist Party's censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.
[03:15:03.305 --> 03:15:12.568]  And Tim Cook and everybody else at Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple, Tim Cook and Apple, you better get ready.
[03:15:12.568 --> 03:15:14.228]  Because you have gone crazy.
[03:15:16.812 --> 03:15:24.816]  You have chosen China because the CFR told you so, and Hollywood told you so, and it doesn't matter if you stole Hollywood and control most of the government.
[03:15:24.816 --> 03:15:26.937]  You're in the political wrong.
[03:15:26.937 --> 03:15:31.239]  And once it's discovered you're working with foreign enemies, that's it, Tim Cook.
[03:15:31.239 --> 03:15:39.443]  I say we stick Tim Cook 18 hours a day in one of his slave factories, and no matter how many drugs he's on, he'll never be able to work with all those poor Chinese slaves.
[03:15:40.501 --> 03:15:42.464]  You dirty monster.
[03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:45.309]  Yeah, he brags that he wants censorship here in America.
[03:15:45.309 --> 03:15:48.434]  You dirty, dirty, dirty tyrant.
[03:15:48.434 --> 03:15:49.376]  He'll be right back.

[03:16:52.936 --> 03:16:54.177]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.177 --> 03:16:58.100]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.100 --> 03:16:59.621]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.621 --> 03:17:02.583]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.583 --> 03:17:08.147]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:18:54.215 --> 03:19:04.797]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:19:04.797 --> 03:19:06.857]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:19:06.857 --> 03:19:09.738]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:09.738 --> 03:19:11.218]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:11.218 --> 03:19:18.040]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow work.
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:19.300]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:29.826]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.826 --> 03:19:46.655]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.655 --> 03:19:49.797]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.957 --> 03:19:57.261]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:57.261 --> 03:20:12.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:18.812]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:23.740 --> 03:20:26.587]  This is Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones in his fourth hour.
[03:20:26.587 --> 03:20:29.975]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, that's my home base.
[03:20:30.931 --> 03:20:37.117]  But it's a pleasure to be sitting in for Alex, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:37.117 --> 03:20:43.043]  I would urge everyone just right out of the gate to support InfoWars and InfoWars Store as well.
[03:20:43.043 --> 03:20:55.775]  I've got a special couple of segments here that I feel very strongly about giving you information that will segue nicely into what you've already heard this broadcast and of course throughout the past, well it's been two weeks since I've sat here.
[03:20:56.275 --> 03:20:58.237]  In this chair, as a matter of fact.
[03:20:58.237 --> 03:20:59.819]  And a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
[03:20:59.819 --> 03:21:01.020]  Of course, the stories of the day.
[03:21:01.886 --> 03:21:04.748]  You've got the Kavanaugh hearing confirmation.
[03:21:04.748 --> 03:21:18.436]  You've got now the one thing that I'm extremely pleased about is the exposure of the Google plans to the exposure of Google's censorship plans that Alex was talking about.
[03:21:18.436 --> 03:21:26.461]  Now, I don't want him to be like rushing back in to grab for the red button to shut me up, but I do want to say this.
[03:21:26.461 --> 03:21:27.981]  When you go back and look at the
[03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:40.519]  Just at the genesis of the censorship, when it began in earnest, you have to go back to the conservative push and the push for the truth, the truth movement.
[03:21:40.519 --> 03:21:47.185]  And of course, Alex Jones was the number one proponent behind the truth movement.
[03:21:47.185 --> 03:21:49.287]  So, by the way, I'm getting some feedback in my ear.
[03:21:49.287 --> 03:21:51.329]  I just want to let the tech know.
[03:21:51.329 --> 03:21:52.050]  But having said that,
[03:21:53.206 --> 03:21:54.106]  He's responsible.
[03:21:54.106 --> 03:22:16.975]  Look, I believe that Alex Jones and Infowars is responsible for the very documents and for the very fines, for example, from the intercept of a couple of days or a day or two ago, or I'm sorry, a month or two ago, that released the information about the censorship search engine in China that's coming to the United States and the background or the framework, the infrastructure there.
[03:22:16.975 --> 03:22:22.277]  But I do believe that when you go back and look at the censorship and look at the evolution of that and the genesis of that,
[03:22:23.101 --> 03:22:26.122]  Alex Jones led the InfoWars, led the charge.
[03:22:26.122 --> 03:22:42.585]  So please understand the reason that InfoWars and people like us are on the receiving end of the most severe of censorship, InfoWars laying the pack on that, is because of the initial genesis and the revelations by InfoWars.
[03:22:42.585 --> 03:22:46.386]  So it's kind of a symbiotic relationship there between cause and effect.
[03:22:46.386 --> 03:22:51.027]  So I just wanted to really make sure everyone knows about that and kind of give a hat tip
[03:22:52.107 --> 03:22:54.469]  I did have gratitude to Alex Jones.
[03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:59.313]  Now with me, I've got Joe Hagman, the co-host of the Hagman Report, with me here.
[03:22:59.313 --> 03:23:02.035]  He's in the office.
[03:23:02.035 --> 03:23:03.436]  I'm in the studio.
[03:23:03.436 --> 03:23:13.144]  We've got some information about how we have effectively infiltrated the opposition, that being the protesters at Capitol Hill.
[03:23:13.144 --> 03:23:15.206]  Of course, we were in Washington, D.C.
[03:23:15.206 --> 03:23:17.908]  last month.
[03:23:17.908 --> 03:23:18.548]  Joe, when was it?
[03:23:18.548 --> 03:23:19.169]  September, right?
[03:23:21.256 --> 03:23:22.417]  You gotta hit the sound.
[03:23:22.417 --> 03:23:24.658]  Your sound's off.
[03:23:24.658 --> 03:23:24.938]  All right.
[03:23:24.938 --> 03:23:26.059]  Is that any better?
[03:23:26.059 --> 03:23:29.620]  We've been traveling a lot lately, and Washington, D.C.
[03:23:29.620 --> 03:23:36.044]  has been one of the destinations where we attended the FAIR Conference, which is the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
[03:23:36.044 --> 03:23:42.527]  And it was filled with policymakers, politicians, you had ICE agents, you had ranchers, you had angel families.
[03:23:43.047 --> 03:23:50.453]  And there we found ourselves right there in the middle of a political circus because this was the beginning of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.
[03:23:50.453 --> 03:23:57.079]  You also had the social media censorship hearings that were ongoing at Capitol Hill also, which Alex Jones was at.
[03:23:57.079 --> 03:24:02.103]  That was when Laura Loomer stood up and made a big ruckus there calling for help from President Trump.
[03:24:02.583 --> 03:24:06.087]  But we learned a number of things on how things work in D.C.
[03:24:06.087 --> 03:24:11.033]  and I guess this might be common sense to others, while it is news to many.
[03:24:11.033 --> 03:24:21.065]  One of the things that we found out and have direct information on is the payment of protesters and how protesting in Washington, D.C., specifically when we're talking about
[03:24:21.565 --> 03:24:21.826]  I think?
[03:24:40.445 --> 03:24:57.587]  On their fine and an extra additional payment on top of that and we have photographs of people who were arrested who had been later seen talking to people with check marks and manila envelopes being handed cash payments and we have at least two examples of that photographically.
[03:24:58.087 --> 03:25:05.316]  Now, we also got confirming evidence or information from another source there that this was the standard operating procedure in Washington, D.C.
[03:25:05.316 --> 03:25:06.918]  and has been for a while.
[03:25:06.918 --> 03:25:10.443]  So, as much as we see with the protests, it's not as organic as you might think.
[03:25:11.574 --> 03:25:13.355]  And that's exactly right.
[03:25:13.355 --> 03:25:16.556]  And people have heard this, obviously, on InfoWars and our show.
[03:25:16.556 --> 03:25:31.460]  But what we have done, just so people understand this, is we've infiltrated, successfully infiltrated, the membership of the ranks, the membership ranks, I should say, of the groups that are casting the payment or giving the payments out.
[03:25:31.460 --> 03:25:35.121]  And based on our findings, and I'll just say this, this is
[03:25:36.141 --> 03:25:38.903]  Professional speculation based on our investigative findings.
[03:25:38.903 --> 03:25:42.184]  So, I'm not gonna say this with any degree of certainty.
[03:25:42.184 --> 03:25:44.506]  This is a preliminary findings.
[03:25:44.506 --> 03:25:57.532]  The money, if you trace it back to its original source, goes back to the firm known as Democracy Alliance, which was created back in 2005 by Democratic political operative Rob Stein.
[03:25:57.532 --> 03:26:04.836]  Alright, so, when you follow the money from the pockets of the billionaires, the liberal billionaires, to the streets,
[03:26:05.496 --> 03:26:16.819]  It goes through probably four or five different hops or hands, maybe, and this is where we've been able to infiltrate and identify the people who are responsible for the payment.
[03:26:16.819 --> 03:26:22.061]  Now, it's not illegal, but it certainly is causing a lot of problems.
[03:26:22.061 --> 03:26:23.981]  No, it's not.
[03:26:23.981 --> 03:26:30.923]  It's business, but does it surprise you the amount of money and how well set up this was?
[03:26:33.883 --> 03:26:53.556]  Yeah, and let me say this, and to give some people an example of the coordination that goes into the optics behind this, and one great example was the, I think it was the VMA Awards that were held in New York City, this is MTV Video Music Awards, and what they did is they had police officers clear the street in front of where this event was being held to bus in paid
[03:26:54.697 --> 03:26:54.877]  Yeah.
[03:27:13.971 --> 03:27:26.002]  Chaos and of this coordination political coordination against Kavanaugh you need to have paid Organization and that's exactly what we see here much like the optics in Hollywood how they control everything to make things look a certain way That's the same thing.
[03:27:26.002 --> 03:27:27.103]  We see in Washington DC.
[03:27:27.103 --> 03:27:37.653]  They control the optics through payment of people actors Activists whatever you want to call them and they do that for the purpose of controlling the optics and it's kind of very similar to how Hollywood works
[03:27:38.357 --> 03:27:42.040]  Alright, we have about a minute left of this segment.
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:54.891]  We find it pretty interesting, and you can comment on this as well, the restrictions in terms of getting into areas of the Capitol, into the executive office buildings, the office buildings themselves, it's pretty restricted.
[03:27:54.891 --> 03:27:56.652]  So, were you surprised?
[03:27:56.652 --> 03:27:58.173]  Yes, I was.
[03:27:58.173 --> 03:28:05.159]  Okay, but a lot of these people that were in there, Joe, they were guests of the Senators and Congress people.
[03:28:06.141 --> 03:28:13.488]  Right, that's another thing we learned is that these tickets are had by the congressmen and senators and they're given out per quota.
[03:28:13.488 --> 03:28:15.930]  You know, each congressman gets ten tickets to give out.
[03:28:15.930 --> 03:28:17.071]  That's just an example.
[03:28:17.071 --> 03:28:23.637]  And it's not like you sign up or register or are able just to show up and say, hey, I would like to attend this event.
[03:28:23.637 --> 03:28:28.481]  You have to be given ticket or authorization, an invitation from a politician.
[03:28:28.481 --> 03:28:29.242]  All that thought, Joe.
[03:28:29.242 --> 03:28:30.243]  There's two elements to this.
[03:28:31.002 --> 03:28:32.043]  Alright, we're up against a break.

[03:30:54.039 --> 03:31:02.423]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.423 --> 03:31:03.884]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:03.884 --> 03:31:08.606]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.606 --> 03:31:13.589]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.829 --> 03:31:33.984]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.484 --> 03:31:38.466]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:31:53.993 --> 03:31:57.915]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:31:59.235 --> 03:32:07.918]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:32:07.918 --> 03:32:09.899]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:32:09.899 --> 03:32:13.360]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:32:13.360 --> 03:32:15.981]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:32:15.981 --> 03:32:18.262]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:32:18.262 --> 03:32:25.225]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:32:25.785 --> 03:32:35.549]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:32:35.549 --> 03:32:36.729]  We'll win.
[03:32:36.729 --> 03:32:39.050]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:46.793]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:32:46.793 --> 03:32:50.494]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[03:32:50.494 --> 03:32:52.054]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:32:52.054 --> 03:32:52.915]  We need your support.
[03:32:52.915 --> 03:32:53.455]  I'm counting on you.
[03:32:57.192 --> 03:33:15.166]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.166 --> 03:33:17.849]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:33:17.849 --> 03:33:20.831]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:20.831 --> 03:33:23.133]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.976 --> 03:33:28.097]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.097 --> 03:33:30.438]  Infowars.com, that's where to go.
[03:33:30.438 --> 03:33:32.278]  Infowarsstore.com as well.
[03:33:32.278 --> 03:33:33.959]  Support the movement by buying the products.
[03:33:33.959 --> 03:33:40.241]  I gotta tell you, I was during the break, I was watching Owen Schroeder on screen and the super male vitality.
[03:33:40.241 --> 03:33:41.301]  He's out throwing baskets.
[03:33:41.301 --> 03:33:46.023]  Let me tell you something, as an old guy, and I'm older than Owen,
[03:33:46.783 --> 03:33:48.704]  This stuff is good stuff.
[03:33:48.704 --> 03:33:49.905]  I feel a lot different.
[03:33:49.905 --> 03:33:50.706]  I take it myself.
[03:33:50.706 --> 03:33:54.288]  As a matter of fact, well, I guess I don't have it right here.
[03:33:54.288 --> 03:33:54.748]  I do have it.
[03:33:54.748 --> 03:33:56.349]  I keep it in my office in the studio.
[03:33:56.349 --> 03:34:01.672]  It's fantastic, especially if you're beyond, you know, middle age like me.
[03:34:01.672 --> 03:34:05.955]  Super Mill Vitality, it will make, I'm going to tell you, you're going to feel a lot different.
[03:34:05.955 --> 03:34:08.556]  So it's, look, I know I don't get paid to say this.
[03:34:08.556 --> 03:34:13.119]  I'm just telling you that it's, it's probably one of the best products I take.
[03:34:13.999 --> 03:34:16.121]  And it works like a charm.
[03:34:16.121 --> 03:34:17.682]  So, super male vitality.
[03:34:17.682 --> 03:34:22.365]  It's just not for guys like Owen, who we had the pleasure of meeting, by the way, in Branson, Missouri.
[03:34:22.365 --> 03:34:24.947]  And in the last segment, I was talking about Washington, D.C.
[03:34:24.947 --> 03:34:26.067]  with my son Joe.
[03:34:26.067 --> 03:34:27.668]  We were there in D.C.
[03:34:27.668 --> 03:34:30.350]  infiltrating the protesting infrastructure.
[03:34:30.350 --> 03:34:32.051]  And, of course, it was a month ago today.
[03:34:32.051 --> 03:34:39.596]  And then we had, I think the following week, we had gone and traveled to Branson, Missouri, where we met David Knight and Owen Schroer.
[03:34:39.596 --> 03:34:41.818]  And I'm not sure if I've been on since that time.
[03:34:42.919 --> 03:34:46.922]  Meeting Owen, and let me tell you, I wouldn't scrap with Owen, okay?
[03:34:46.922 --> 03:34:52.968]  He's a pretty well-built guy, and super male vitality, I'm sure, has a lot to do with it.
[03:34:52.968 --> 03:34:59.534]  And speaking of that, Owen Shroyer is going to be, it's my understanding, going to be at the WalkAway Project October 26th, 27th, and 28th.
[03:35:02.196 --> 03:35:08.759]  And, you know, this is the most important election coming up in our lifetimes, the midterms.
[03:35:08.759 --> 03:35:13.161]  Second only to, perhaps, arguably, the 2016 presidential election.
[03:35:13.161 --> 03:35:16.542]  Obviously that was, on a larger scale, more important.
[03:35:16.542 --> 03:35:21.144]  But relative to elections, this coming midterm election is the most important.
[03:35:21.144 --> 03:35:22.425]  So this walk-away campaign,
[03:35:23.005 --> 03:35:30.891]  I would urge everyone to sign up and visit the March website, the WalkAway March website for the specific details.
[03:35:30.891 --> 03:35:33.914]  But look, follow the WalkAway campaign.
[03:35:33.914 --> 03:35:39.338]  Understand that it's important that we need to support those who are walking away from the Communist Party.
[03:35:39.998 --> 03:35:45.984]  That's right, Communist Party, not Democratic Socialist, not Socialist, not Democratic Party, but the Communist Party.
[03:35:45.984 --> 03:35:54.433]  Having said that, oh, by the way, this is day number 623, for those who are counting, of the Donald J. Trump presidency.
[03:35:54.433 --> 03:35:56.495]  Day 623, I believe it is.
[03:35:56.495 --> 03:35:59.518]  And 33 days away from the midterms for those keeping count at home.
[03:36:00.814 --> 03:36:04.777]  So it's again, it's ever so ever important to really get involved.
[03:36:04.777 --> 03:36:19.066]  But I want to bring Joe back because just to finish our thought about the infiltration and about identifying those people who are involved in the, who are the paymasters of the protesters and who are creating the optics of division and creating the division.
[03:36:19.066 --> 03:36:28.032]  Joe, I had talked five, six years ago when you first came on with me, even before that, about the civil war that the left is stoking or attempting to stoke up.
[03:36:28.892 --> 03:36:30.634]  We see it now.
[03:36:30.634 --> 03:36:39.021]  My only problem, I guess, if it would be a problem, was being about five or six years too early and the sources I had five or six years too early.
[03:36:39.021 --> 03:36:42.744]  But let's get into what's going on at the higher levels.
[03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:44.842]  Yeah, let's do this.
[03:36:44.842 --> 03:36:58.360]  And the political atmosphere and climate has just gotten worse since the campaign of 2016 where you saw people coming and causing violence at Trump rallies and Trump events and the media turning around and blaming it on President Trump himself.
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:37:06.606]  And we've seen this constant flow of information from the mainstream media saying how the right is violent, it's Trump supporters who are violent.
[03:37:06.606 --> 03:37:13.370]  And in the meantime, it's the Antifas and the other groups that are anti-Trump, anti-freedom, anti-American who are the violent ones.
[03:37:13.370 --> 03:37:20.055]  And this is, you know, you have well over a thousand cases of unprovoked violence against Trump supporters for political purposes that have already been documented.
[03:37:20.055 --> 03:37:25.599]  And it's gotten so bad that yesterday Rand Paul's wife wrote a letter talking about how she now sleeps with a gun.
[03:37:26.019 --> 03:37:26.740]  We're good to go.
[03:37:48.554 --> 03:37:51.615]  And yet we still see the calls for violence increasing.
[03:37:51.615 --> 03:37:54.696]  We still see the calls for Trump's assassination increasing.
[03:37:54.696 --> 03:37:56.216]  And who gets banned on Twitter?
[03:37:56.216 --> 03:37:57.717]  It's platforms like Infowars.
[03:37:57.717 --> 03:38:01.058]  It's platforms like Hagman Report on YouTube.
[03:38:01.058 --> 03:38:02.138]  And what?
[03:38:02.138 --> 03:38:09.841]  And Paul Joseph Watson did a great video about this on the censorship last week where he shows that ISIS still has accounts on Twitter and YouTube that are active.
[03:38:09.841 --> 03:38:10.821]  He shows that Antifa
[03:38:11.101 --> 03:38:11.942]  Calling for violence.
[03:38:11.942 --> 03:38:14.724]  The same Hollywood celebrities that called for violence.
[03:38:14.724 --> 03:38:19.407]  Even the Peter Fonda is calling for Barron Trump to be put in a cage with pedophiles.
[03:38:19.407 --> 03:38:21.288]  Untouched, unbanned, nothing wrong.
[03:38:21.288 --> 03:38:29.254]  But you have conservative platforms telling the truth out there, exposing these lies, and they get banned for hate speech, quote-unquote hate speech.
[03:38:30.314 --> 03:38:38.618]  And now we have this Kavanaugh, this whole big controversy that has been created by the globalists, the deep state, over Kavanaugh.
[03:38:38.618 --> 03:38:40.718]  What's going to happen if he gets confirmed?
[03:38:40.718 --> 03:38:49.902]  People are saying there are going to be riots that make the inaugurational riots look like child's play when we see what comes after Kavanaugh is confirmed.
[03:38:49.902 --> 03:38:52.223]  And then you have the 2018 midterm elections.
[03:38:52.223 --> 03:38:57.245]  And the speculation about that is anything from a blue wave to a red wave and any and everything in between.
[03:38:57.845 --> 03:39:06.191]  If it doesn't go the left's way, though, there's one thing that we can guarantee, and that's an increase on the political violence and an increase on the rhetoric of violence that we will hear from the left.
[03:39:06.191 --> 03:39:15.337]  But I see between Kavanaugh, if he gets confirmed, and the election, an increase of violence that we have not seen yet under President Trump.
[03:39:15.337 --> 03:39:16.598]  Not his fault, obviously.
[03:39:17.644 --> 03:39:18.564]  Fantastic summary.
[03:39:18.564 --> 03:39:27.588]  We're seeing this also being mapped out and planned out on various side threads on Twitter, message boards that are password protected.
[03:39:27.588 --> 03:39:36.711]  We've been able to secure alternate identities or identities that lead to infiltrate these message boards.
[03:39:37.951 --> 03:39:47.917]  And we're watching, conducting surveillance, electronic surveillance of some of these, and we're watching the plans, the people making the plans for these demonstrations and riots.
[03:39:47.917 --> 03:39:51.760]  And none of this is happening spontaneously, as you said.
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:53.101]  So, this is where it's at.
[03:39:53.101 --> 03:40:05.749]  And by the way, there was a great article, I just want to toss this in there, here's me near the bottom of the hour here, or near the break, but there was a great article at American Thinker today by Frank Hawkins.
[03:40:07.029 --> 03:40:10.011]  Obama's America on display at Kavanaugh hearings.
[03:40:10.011 --> 03:40:24.836]  So for the people who are intellectually minded and want to really take a look at what's happening, this is what we're seeing out here is Obama's legacy and the divisiveness, the division was not caused by President Donald Trump.
[03:40:24.836 --> 03:40:28.618]  It was caused by Obama and is still being caused by Obama.
[03:40:28.618 --> 03:40:31.179]  Joe, I think you can agree with this.
[03:40:31.179 --> 03:40:33.620]  Pretty much all roads lead back to Obama, don't they?
[03:40:34.981 --> 03:40:53.953]  Well, yeah, and those lead back to, you know, the Brzezinskis, the Soroses, the CFRs, the Bilderberg Groups, the think tanks that really pull the strings behind the scenes for anybody from politicians to lobbyists to policy makers, decision makers across the boards, you know, big business CEOs and whatnot.
[03:40:56.094 --> 03:41:17.305]  You know it's really troubling to see how far many people on the right thought that under President Trump we would see some kind of reprieve and we have at least in the the economy being the big one the regulations that he's rolled back I mean he's done more he's had more accomplished than than we could ever have expected yet at the same time we've seen other areas where the deep state and the left continue to push and continue to make progress pushing
[03:41:17.805 --> 03:41:21.926]  In areas where Trump's getting resistance from inside his own White House.
[03:41:21.926 --> 03:41:27.348]  And this is, you know, deep state, globalist agenda that is going to move forward regardless of who's in office.
[03:41:27.348 --> 03:41:30.248]  And that's what they plan on doing.
[03:41:30.248 --> 03:41:39.991]  Now, we haven't talked about the FISA abuses that Obama was a part of.
[03:41:39.991 --> 03:41:43.672]  And that, of course, that's a whole different story by itself.
[03:41:44.752 --> 03:41:58.001]  All of this in spite of, all of the wins by President Trump, in spite of the opposition, in spite of rigging the election and having the surveillance on the Trump campaign.
[03:41:58.001 --> 03:41:59.702]  And it's just amazing to see all of the wins.
[03:41:59.702 --> 03:42:09.788]  I want to address that and also at the next segment, your concerns, and I think these are reasonable concerns, and people out there, I've been hearing from a lot of people out there,
[03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:17.546]  Your concerns, Joe, and your findings based on your investigation and research on Lindsey Graham's whiplash, you know...
[03:42:19.003 --> 03:42:19.323]  Yeah.
[03:42:19.323 --> 03:42:20.324]  What do you make of that?
[03:42:20.324 --> 03:42:21.464]  I want to talk about Lindsey Graham.
[03:42:21.464 --> 03:42:25.286]  You know, Alex Jones has called him out extensively.
[03:42:25.286 --> 03:42:27.087]  I have called him out extensively on air.
[03:42:27.087 --> 03:42:28.228]  And we're seeing this switch.
[03:42:28.228 --> 03:42:32.490]  He's gone from a deep state operative to some kind of advocate for freedom.
[03:42:32.490 --> 03:42:34.691]  We're going to talk about why that is on the other side.
[03:42:34.691 --> 03:42:35.151]  All right.
[03:42:35.151 --> 03:42:36.872]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman.
[03:42:36.872 --> 03:42:37.972]  The Hagman Report.

[03:46:02.023 --> 03:46:04.064]  Crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[03:46:04.064 --> 03:46:05.545]  It's very hard for me to get.
[03:46:05.545 --> 03:46:07.425]  It's the good halogen.
[03:46:07.425 --> 03:46:09.566]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[03:46:09.566 --> 03:46:16.109]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[03:46:16.109 --> 03:46:18.710]  Bio-True Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:20.111]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[03:46:21.431 --> 03:46:27.135]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[03:46:27.135 --> 03:46:28.936]  So these go incredibly well together.
[03:46:28.936 --> 03:46:30.516]  We have a combo of those.
[03:46:30.516 --> 03:46:31.897]  Just experience it for yourself.
[03:46:31.897 --> 03:46:34.619]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[03:46:34.619 --> 03:46:35.659]  Very simple stuff.
[03:46:35.659 --> 03:46:37.280]  Filter your water.
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:39.361]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[03:46:39.361 --> 03:46:40.822]  Best out there for the price.
[03:46:40.822 --> 03:46:41.903]  When I say it's the last run,
[03:46:43.143 --> 03:46:44.704]  I think it'll be six months to a year until we get more.
[03:46:44.704 --> 03:46:45.545]  I hope we get more.
[03:46:45.545 --> 03:46:46.866]  This is the last run it looks like.
[03:46:46.866 --> 03:46:47.587]  Survival Short Exit 2.
[03:46:47.587 --> 03:46:49.449]  InfoWars4.com or InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.

[03:47:18.454 --> 03:47:23.479]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:23.479 --> 03:47:24.720]  Folks, support the movement.
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:27.162]  I was talking about Supermail Vitality.
[03:47:27.162 --> 03:47:29.324]  I take it, it's one of the best products out there.
[03:47:29.324 --> 03:47:30.285]  I can tell a difference.
[03:47:30.285 --> 03:47:37.272]  You know, I don't throw baskets like Owen Schroer, and we met in Branson, Missouri, here just a couple of weeks ago.
[03:47:37.272 --> 03:47:39.934]  But it does make a difference, both mentally and physically.
[03:47:40.975 --> 03:47:43.596]  Big proponent of that, so visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:43.596 --> 03:47:46.718]  Support this movement and support InfoWars every way you can.
[03:47:46.718 --> 03:47:55.022]  And let me tell you something else, Owen and David Knight are, Owen Schroer and David Knight are two of the greatest people you'll ever meet.
[03:47:55.022 --> 03:47:59.764]  They are genuine in person and behind the scenes and up front.
[03:47:59.764 --> 03:48:05.687]  So a lot of, we really think a lot of both Owen Schroer and David Knight.
[03:48:06.267 --> 03:48:12.272]  This segment here with me is Joe Hagman, the other part, the co-host of the Hagman Report.
[03:48:12.272 --> 03:48:14.374]  HagmanReport.com is our home base.
[03:48:14.374 --> 03:48:18.418]  We have some concerns, or Joe has some concerns, about Lindsey Graham.
[03:48:18.418 --> 03:48:22.882]  And a lot of people out there, and I know Alex Jones does as well, what the heck happened to Lindsey Graham?
[03:48:22.882 --> 03:48:32.170]  And I've often said that maybe McCain's hand, having been dislodged from the orifice, makes a difference.
[03:48:32.170 --> 03:48:32.970]  What do you find, Joe?
[03:48:34.255 --> 03:48:46.483]  Well, I found nothing definitive except to look over Lindsey Graham's past actions and his present actions and what he has been advocating for in the past versus what he's advocating for now.
[03:48:46.483 --> 03:49:01.813]  And I've come to the conclusion that he's either a political opportunist that goes on a winning side, you know, like when Obama was in power he chose to support Obama's policies in Syria and whatnot because, you know, that was the way that could score him the most points and now that Trump's in power.
[03:49:02.533 --> 03:49:03.474]  He's just an opportunist.
[03:49:03.474 --> 03:49:06.135]  He's going to support what Trump supports.
[03:49:06.135 --> 03:49:20.480]  Or there is the more nefarious, you know, the blackmail aspect where he is being blackmailed or switching allegiances behind the scenes based on some kind of controversy or, you know, out of... I don't know what you'd call it.
[03:49:20.480 --> 03:49:21.480]  Walk me through that.
[03:49:21.480 --> 03:49:24.822]  Walk me through that scenario.
[03:49:24.822 --> 03:49:28.503]  The White Hats blackmailing Lindsey Graham would be, in this case, obviously, right?
[03:49:29.173 --> 03:49:31.774]  So blackmail can be used both ways.
[03:49:31.774 --> 03:49:32.975]  Blackmail can be used both ways.
[03:49:32.975 --> 03:49:34.635]  So say there is something on Lindsey Graham.
[03:49:34.635 --> 03:49:42.699]  And we know, and I'm not saying there is, but we know historically, especially as of late in this political arena we call D.C.
[03:49:42.699 --> 03:49:48.622]  with our representatives in the House and the Senate, that many are influenced by many things.
[03:49:48.622 --> 03:49:49.642]  Money from lobbyists.
[03:49:49.642 --> 03:49:52.723]  They are influenced sometimes by personal politics and beliefs.
[03:49:52.723 --> 03:49:56.065]  Other times they are put in positions where they are blackmailed.
[03:49:56.585 --> 03:50:08.272]  And if you can imagine a political party in power blackmailing Lindsey Graham to get X, Y, and Z done while the power regime has changed.
[03:50:08.272 --> 03:50:10.373]  There's a transformation from Obama to Trump.
[03:50:11.774 --> 03:50:16.218]  That same blackmail information could be used by somebody else for other purposes.
[03:50:16.218 --> 03:50:19.500]  I don't know that that's true or that even happens, but that is a possibility.
[03:50:19.500 --> 03:50:21.882]  But something has changed with Lindsey Graham.
[03:50:21.882 --> 03:50:26.125]  In 2015, you have countless examples of him, you know, calling for more troops in Syria.
[03:50:26.125 --> 03:50:41.157]  John McCain and Lindsey Graham, they were a united duo in the mainstream media, constantly war hawking for more troops, more intervention in Syria between Obama administration and even the Trump administration, if you remember, after that last false flag gas attack.
[03:50:41.557 --> 03:50:53.843]  Well, in this Kavanaugh fight, we've seen Lindsey Graham really come out on the side of liberty and freedom, and kind of the opposite of what he's been supporting for the last 10 years as a senator, just from my own observations.
[03:50:53.843 --> 03:50:56.305]  And I don't know why, and it's really bothering me.
[03:50:56.305 --> 03:51:00.587]  And I'm not quick to jump on the Lindsey Graham bandwagon, because for so long I've viewed him
[03:51:01.207 --> 03:51:12.491]  As a political hack, as an enemy, as somebody who is not a friend of the American Constitution or the American way of life, just based on his own policies in Syria and what he had backed under Obama.
[03:51:12.491 --> 03:51:19.213]  But now, he seems to be on the right side of the Constitution, on the right side of history, and I don't know that I buy it.
[03:51:19.213 --> 03:51:21.774]  I'm glad to see it, but what are the reasons behind it?
[03:51:21.774 --> 03:51:24.275]  That's my real concern.
[03:51:24.275 --> 03:51:27.576]  You don't think this was an organic transformation?
[03:51:27.576 --> 03:51:29.257]  I don't think anything in DC is organic.
[03:51:30.251 --> 03:51:39.558]  It could, but look when we're talking about the lack of organic protests and instead they're organized paid protesters and we learn nothing is organic when it comes to Washington, D.C.
[03:51:39.558 --> 03:51:41.100]  Why would this situation be any different?
[03:51:41.100 --> 03:51:49.206]  So all I'm saying is to urge caution before, I mean, you know, send them, give them a phone call, send them a letter, an email saying, you know, thank you for sticking up for freedom.
[03:51:49.206 --> 03:51:54.330]  Thank you for sticking up for the rule of law, the American Constitution, for Kavanaugh and Trump.
[03:51:55.030 --> 03:52:03.535]  But be wary before continuing support for him because he has the history and the propensity to go way off the deep end on the wrong side.
[03:52:03.535 --> 03:52:17.344]  So all I'm saying is as we see him become more of a prominent figure, become more of a vocal supporter for President Trump and the agenda that Trump is pushing, to just be wary and be careful.
[03:52:17.344 --> 03:52:18.304]  I guess we shouldn't, you know...
[03:52:19.686 --> 03:52:25.699]  Call him out or anything, but like I said, just have that discernment and understanding before jumping on the bandwagon.
[03:52:26.707 --> 03:52:29.608]  Very well stated, and I agree with you on that.
[03:52:29.608 --> 03:52:33.229]  Especially when the transformation is so overt.
[03:52:33.229 --> 03:52:35.230]  Yeah.
[03:52:35.230 --> 03:52:36.571]  Exactly.
[03:52:36.571 --> 03:52:41.552]  Now, here we are, and I just want to kind of recap this hour so much.
[03:52:41.552 --> 03:52:47.695]  Of course, Alex Jones was talking initially this hour about Iran and the situation there.
[03:52:47.695 --> 03:52:49.735]  I don't know whether you caught some of that?
[03:52:49.735 --> 03:52:51.676]  Yeah, I did.
[03:52:51.676 --> 03:52:54.037]  Okay, because there were some fantastic video clips.
[03:52:54.037 --> 03:52:54.277]  Go ahead.
[03:52:55.425 --> 03:52:58.189]  Yeah, and real quick, there is something that's up on Hagman Report.
[03:52:58.189 --> 03:53:04.216]  France blames Iran for foiled bomb plot near Paris, freezes Iranian assets.
[03:53:04.216 --> 03:53:10.084]  This is something, you know, in this news media 24-7 Trump news cycle that we have in our mainstream media.
[03:53:10.544 --> 03:53:12.145]  Things like this get lost in the fray.
[03:53:29.097 --> 03:53:32.618]  Yeah, he wants to arm the citizens of Iran, and I couldn't think of a better idea.
[03:53:32.618 --> 03:53:37.919]  I would have to do more vetting and go re-watch that last interview there.
[03:53:37.919 --> 03:53:53.002]  But it's very positive, and we have spoken with author Bill Salus, who's written a number of books about Bible prophecy and the intersection of Bible prophecy and current events, who has said that there is a Christian revolution in Iran, where there are millions of people who are turning to Jesus in Iran.
[03:53:53.482 --> 03:54:01.705]  And that it is being, the church is being oppressed and this information is not making its way to the U.S., to the West, to the churches in the U.S.
[03:54:01.705 --> 03:54:04.426]  And, you know, so is there a revolution?
[03:54:04.426 --> 03:54:07.507]  A populist-type revolution happening in Iran?
[03:54:07.507 --> 03:54:12.408]  I'm tend to leaning in that direction as we're seeing it really take over the Western world with Brexit.
[03:54:12.408 --> 03:54:13.869]  We've seen it throughout Europe.
[03:54:13.869 --> 03:54:20.811]  We still see it in Europe despite the crazy leaders and their push towards a complete de-Westernization of the Western nations.
[03:54:21.451 --> 03:54:26.672]  There is a populist movement, and it's not only isolated to the United States or to the Western Europe.
[03:54:26.672 --> 03:54:29.693]  It is going to be happening across the world, China included.
[03:54:29.693 --> 03:54:31.654]  You're going to see some changes in China.
[03:54:31.654 --> 03:54:32.634]  It might not be immediate.
[03:54:32.634 --> 03:54:34.694]  Maybe it will be a decade.
[03:54:34.694 --> 03:54:40.456]  But this populist movement has legs, and it has legs across the world, and expect to see a lot of things changing in Iran.
[03:54:41.216 --> 03:55:03.534]  And you brought this up earlier, with this movement toward the freedom, this populist movement all across the West, well all across the world, but the backlash in the West and here in America is becoming more and more dangerous as the Democratic Socialists are losing grips on their power, which is why this election is so critical.
[03:55:04.415 --> 03:55:13.924]  However, with this danger, there's a real and clear and present danger of a civil war breaking out based on the deep ideological divide, right?
[03:55:13.924 --> 03:55:23.534]  We know that no transition from a tyrannical government to a government of freedom by the people has been peaceful throughout history.
[03:55:23.994 --> 03:55:24.254]  We're good.
[03:55:39.829 --> 03:55:43.693]  Blood's going to have to be spilled, and this is just historically how it works.
[03:55:43.693 --> 03:55:49.779]  No power has ever transitioned that easily, especially when we're talking about power over nations and geopolitical regions.
[03:55:49.779 --> 03:56:02.010]  But it can be done, and I think there's a willingness of the people in the world, in the overall world, that are just sick and tired of being oppressed, are sick and tired of having oppressed for whether it's religious or class warfare means.
[03:56:02.370 --> 03:56:15.671]  Whatever it may be and they see that this is an opportunity where their voices can be heard they can come together and make a difference and make some actual significant changes if they're willing to sacrifice what they have in their freedom in their lives and put that on the line for that freedom
[03:56:17.442 --> 03:56:17.942]  Exactly.
[03:56:17.942 --> 03:56:20.063]  And folks, that's Joe Hagman.
[03:56:20.063 --> 03:56:27.725]  He's my son and him along with Owen Schroer, the younger, the next generation.
[03:56:27.725 --> 03:56:45.351]  Look, I can't be more proud than I am of my son Joe and people like Owen and others who are actually going to inherit this mission, this mission to make sure freedom stays alive, especially in this day of such hatred, rage and division.
[03:56:46.051 --> 03:56:54.161]  So, Joe, I want to thank you so much for joining me, because you have so much information, and you articulated it very well, and I appreciate that.
[03:56:54.161 --> 03:56:59.367]  And I just want to say, Branson, Missouri, we got a chance, as you said, to meet Owen and to meet David Knight.
[03:56:59.367 --> 03:57:02.251]  David Knight did just a tremendous presentation.
[03:57:02.811 --> 03:57:06.954]  And you can find that presentation available on the DVD.
[03:57:06.954 --> 03:57:08.716]  I think it's Gen6.com.
[03:57:08.716 --> 03:57:12.899]  But just as they are on camera, they are in real life.
[03:57:12.899 --> 03:57:16.821]  And you love to see that because so many people have a persona when on camera.
[03:57:16.821 --> 03:57:22.826]  But when they're just as real in real life as they are on the air, then you know you're dealing with somebody who really cares.
[03:57:22.826 --> 03:57:25.428]  And that's what I got from meeting both of those gentlemen.
[03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:39.423]  And I think we'll be posting a couple of photographs from backstage at Branson with David Knight and Owen Schroer on our website HagmanReport.com and, uh, InfoWars, feel free to use those photographs as well.
[03:57:39.423 --> 03:57:43.128]  But, um, here I've got about, we've got about 90 seconds or less left.
[03:57:43.128 --> 03:57:43.788]  What do you see?
[03:57:47.148 --> 03:57:52.874]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.874 --> 03:58:00.742]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.742 --> 03:58:03.885]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.085 --> 03:58:09.352]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:58:09.352 --> 03:58:12.136]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
