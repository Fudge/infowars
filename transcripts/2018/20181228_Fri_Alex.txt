[00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:19.594]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:51.870]  You know, I had an epiphany yesterday when I went and saw the movie Chaney.
[00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:59.572]  And it was really an illustrative epiphany that I'm going to
[00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.768]  Carry out in the start of the next segment.
[00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.270]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.932]  Obviously, TV viewers will be able to see it.
[00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.435]  And of course, I'm calling the movie Chaney.
[00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.816]  The movie is Vice.
[00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:14.938]  I'm teleprompter free here.
[00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.784]  And I went to see it because I was interested because it was a political, you know, fiction piece.
[00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:29.510]  But I also went because I was told that the movie basically ends with yours truly, which it does.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.303]  Just like the documentary about William F. Buckley did.
[00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.828]  I guess I'm this symbol of all that's wrong in the world to the left.
[00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.112]  And so they have to misrepresent who I am and what I stand for.
[00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:53.777]  But there's one part in the film, and I think the film's well done.
[00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:58.881]  Hollywood's attacking it and giving it bad reviews, or mixed reviews, because
[00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:07.475]  It humanizes Dick Cheney, makes him look like a terrible sociopath, but it still humanizes him to a certain extent.
[00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.456]  Oh, that's kind of an oxymoron, humanizing a sociopath.
[00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:17.578]  And it's a big apology, you know, for the Democrats, a big cover-up.
[00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:22.119]  But there's one part, actually a couple parts.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.701]  They hint at 9-11 being an inside job, and that just means the government stood down and let it happen.
[00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:56.310]  But they also have a scene early on in the beginning that shows an image that I remember seeing last year and I remember wanting to make the point about the photograph and the video we're going to show that was made in the film and pinching myself that I hadn't made that point last year.
[00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.670]  Now, I've actually made this point many, many times.
[00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.211]  When you hear me make the point, you say, okay, yeah, we've heard that a hundred times.
[00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:09.093]  But if you get this point, you get everything.
[00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.073]  Absolutely everything.
[00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.554]  So I tend to get real excited when I cover things like this.
[00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:24.376]  I'm gonna try to be a good boy when we come back and really delve into this for at least one segment, solid.
[00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:29.120]  I owe it to you, I owe it to myself, I owe it to my family to do this.
[00:03:32.623 --> 00:03:34.124]  So we'll do that when we come back from break.
[00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:44.712]  And then this story ties in to the whole rest of the enchilada.
[00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:50.536]  And you know, I've got all the treaties here in my hands.
[00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:52.698]  It's a lot of preparation for this.
[00:03:54.758 --> 00:04:05.801]  And that's really the problem is there's so much information that I tend to just get caught going into each little piece of what I'm covering and proving each little piece instead of just telling you, hey, here it is.
[00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.541]  And then you need to look this for yourself.
[00:04:10.862 --> 00:04:12.762]  But there's a reason they want us off the air.
[00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:19.544]  And I just can't believe that there's enough people in the establishment that even know what's going on.
[00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:22.556]  And they do.
[00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:24.417]  And they're going along with this.
[00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.018]  But they're doing it really out of fear.
[00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.861]  They're not just doing it out of, they want power, or be part of the power structure.
[00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:37.324]  They do it because, you know, you start bucking this, the knives come out.
[00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.147]  But see, the knives are already out.
[00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:50.111]  There is a genocide taking place that dwarfs everything Hitler did.
[00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.053]  Conservatively, 100 to 1.
[00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:55.654]  At least 100 to 1.
[00:04:55.714 --> 00:05:01.378]  Stay with us, we'll break it all down on the other side.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.484]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:15.869]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.691]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits,
[00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:22.332]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:28.815]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:35.138]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:42.663]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:49.788]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[00:05:49.988 --> 00:05:54.371]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[00:05:54.851 --> 00:06:02.216]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:13.717]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:21.801]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:29.004]  It's Friday, December 28th, 2018.
[00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:34.647]  And we've cracked the code.
[00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.989]  We've cracked the globalists, the technocracies,
[00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.363]  Plan to get them to their world government.
[00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:50.267]  And for the globalists, world government is just the beginning.
[00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:59.954]  Now, the decision has been made to slowly poison and dumb down and kill everyone on the planet.
[00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:01.395]  Basically, about 99%.
[00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:04.377]  That's the internal document numbers.
[00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:05.598]  It's about a 99.9% extermination operation.
[00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:12.363]  The college students were told 80% extermination.
[00:07:12.704 --> 00:07:14.886]  Graduate students were told 90% extermination.
[00:07:15.246 --> 00:07:17.769]  Higher-level government officials were told 99% extermination.
[00:07:22.613 --> 00:07:24.795]  And of course, you now see the public rollout of that everywhere.
[00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:30.721]  We spent most of the show yesterday detailing it from the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, the Carnegie Endowment.
[00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:32.382]  Humans are inherently evil.
[00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:32.963]  We have to get rid of them.
[00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:37.052]  And then we have the Malthusian eugenics background of that.
[00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:47.474]  We have the entire British Empire's funding getting behind it in 1855 in a global project that is all detailed in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:52.755]  That's still, they're trying to have it removed off Amazon, but you can also watch for free on YouTube.
[00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:55.336]  But let me just stop there, giving footnotes.
[00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.025]  There's a lot of big news out today.
[00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:04.990]  The EU has announced that we need a planetary world government to stop nation-states.
[00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.610]  That's a quote.
[00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:11.538]  Merkel, disgraced but still the chancellor, but her party's lost power in the parliament.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.123]  Merkel said, quote,
[00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:27.590]  Nations must give up their sovereignty, and that citizens of nations must be ignored, and that outside alliances must team up in an orderly fashion to stop the nations and their peoples.
[00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.312]  These are quotes she gave at a national televised event.
[00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:33.553]  We have links to the video.
[00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:34.213]  It's in German.
[00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.314]  That's called treason!
[00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:42.877]  We're going to ignore the people, we're going to ignore our law, and we're going to take your freedom away and merge with the Middle East.
[00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:46.848]  What have we been telling you for 20 years?
[00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:54.191]  But see, now that it's all happening, we've got to be off the air because the credibility is so high.
[00:08:54.972 --> 00:08:55.952]  That's what I've told my crew.
[00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:59.654]  Just us staying on the air is an incredible victory.
[00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:00.935]  I'm going to talk about that later in the broadcast.
[00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:07.718]  Just you spreading the word in any way is the end of these people.
[00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:09.519]  But you've got to do it.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.000]  Let's stop there.
[00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:21.276]  I'm going to get into a subject of the Exterminism Project, and I'm just going to look at a few of the tentacles.
[00:09:23.758 --> 00:09:25.659]  But two of the larger ones.
[00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:29.902]  And I'm going to look at one third tentacle as well.
[00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:34.205]  But all of these tentacles
[00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:39.621]  need you to opt into them.
[00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.362]  It's a metaphysical rule.
[00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:45.584]  It's like in the Bible, it says the devil has to go up and get permission from God to do certain things.
[00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:48.486]  And so we have to be warned first.
[00:09:48.566 --> 00:10:00.153]  So, in all three of these tentacles, you notice it's a Trojan horse you take in and that you accept and that you acquiesce to.
[00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:08.388]  And now we're entering the phase where even that's being removed, and they're going to Forced.
[00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.411]  So let me get into it.
[00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:17.454]  But first, for TV viewers, radio listeners, obviously I will break it down.
[00:10:17.474 --> 00:10:33.925]  I went to see Vice, the movie about Dick Cheney yesterday, because obviously I wanted to see it, and reportedly the movie ended with yours truly as the ultimate sign of evil, which it does end with yours truly as if I'm Baphomet.
[00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:41.751]  Now, as if here's the new Cheney, here's the new enemy, which I'm the complete opposite of Dick Cheney.
[00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:59.107]  Now, before I get into the tentacles of death that are 100% already in your body, already in your DNA, already killing you right now.
[00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:00.769]  Most of us are walking dead.
[00:11:03.257 --> 00:11:07.559]  This is an absolute fact, and they're about to really accelerate the extermination.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.841]  So far, it's just been ambient.
[00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:15.924]  It's been background, kind of like crickets sawing their feet together.
[00:11:17.765 --> 00:11:21.867]  Or like frogs, or a leaf blower off in the distance.
[00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:27.050]  It's going to be a freight train if you wanted to quantitate it on a sound scale.
[00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.452]  And actually, some of it is sound.
[00:11:33.035 --> 00:11:44.600]  At the microwave frequency that rattles water molecules and rubs them together at a perfect oscillation frequency to rip DNA apart.
[00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:56.185]  And it was designed and the exact oscillation has been chosen to make it the most vicious out of hundreds of combinations that wouldn't be as damaging.
[00:11:58.516 --> 00:11:59.698]  I'm sorry, I haven't gotten to it yet.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:14.015]  But the movie Cheney, Vice, about Cheney, opens up with we get so used to tyranny and so used to oppression.
[00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:22.235]  That we can be standing right next to death itself, and we don't even notice it.
[00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:30.542]  And I remember thinking the same thing when I saw this video and this photo, I'm gonna put on screen now, of a golfer, a group of golfers in Washington State last year.
[00:12:32.203 --> 00:12:35.526]  And you see them playing golf, they're on the putting green.
[00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:43.392]  And as you zoom back, you see
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.083]  That there is giant fires in the background.
[00:12:52.546 --> 00:12:52.826]  So.
[00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.792]  They say an image can say a thousand words.
[00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:00.793]  Well, it certainly has.
[00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:03.295]  We'll put it back on television for viewers.
[00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:04.896]  We can just put the Daily Mail article up if you'd like.
[00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:05.857]  Now.
[00:13:05.877 --> 00:13:08.619]  Or we can roll the video for folks.
[00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:09.800]  We can do that to be nice as well.
[00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:10.581]  Now.
[00:13:12.803 --> 00:13:14.064]  This is illustrative.
[00:13:18.525 --> 00:13:39.462]  Of how you can be right next to a burning inferno with ash raining down on you and you don't even care because everyone else goes on about their business as if it's no big deal and as if it doesn't matter.
[00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:48.440]  Because no one around you behaves like it's serious or something should be done so you don't take action.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.621]  Even though people are dying.
[00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:54.964]  Even though governments won't cut fire breaks as they did before and are allowing it to happen.
[00:13:55.324 --> 00:13:56.985]  Even though it's burning down houses.
[00:13:58.006 --> 00:14:06.191]  You adapt to living in hell instead of changing your environment to make it better and to fix it.
[00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:29.044]  Now, if you can become callous or blind to fires in California or fires in Washington or fires wherever, and not even be upset at the government that has policies in place for 30 years not letting you cut fire breaks that have allowed the epidemic, well, what are you going to do about things you can't see, like gravity?
[00:14:32.103 --> 00:14:36.367]  Or cell phone radiation up to 5G and higher that they admit gives you cancer.
[00:14:36.567 --> 00:14:37.468]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:38.449]  What are you going to do?
[00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:45.776]  Well, everybody knows if you jump off a cliff, you can't see the gravity, the gravity well of planet Earth.
[00:14:45.996 --> 00:14:51.461]  But you know that if you jump off a 200-foot cliff, you're going to probably die.
[00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.962]  You're certainly going to wish you were dead.
[00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:55.465]  You're going to break your legs, your back, your head.
[00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:57.667]  You're going to break most of the bones in your body.
[00:14:59.138 --> 00:15:09.602]  But if a couple hundred yards away there's a giant, fast-moving inferno, well it turned out in this case they had enough time to finish up their 18 holes and get in their car and go, but later the golf course did burn down.
[00:15:09.622 --> 00:15:14.243]  But it doesn't matter, you're gonna finish your game.
[00:15:17.245 --> 00:15:23.867]  And again, it's part of a culture of total and complete selfishness, but if we can get people to understand cell phone radiation,
[00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:27.009]  And things like that are like gravity.
[00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:29.230]  They're there, but you can't see them.
[00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.571]  And they're killing you.
[00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:38.712]  But instead of jumping off a cliff and you die 10 seconds, 20 seconds later when you hit the bottom, with radiation it takes a few years.
[00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:39.693]  20, 30 years.
[00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:40.133]  10 years.
[00:15:40.153 --> 00:15:40.573]  5 years.
[00:15:40.593 --> 00:15:41.633]  Depending on the person.
[00:15:43.413 --> 00:15:44.794]  Some people are more susceptible to it.
[00:15:44.874 --> 00:15:45.554]  Others aren't.
[00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:53.379]  Within that recognizing the threat and being conscious of it, there's a way out of this.
[00:15:54.099 --> 00:16:00.104]  But if you can't see a giant fire coming your direction, how are you ever going to do anything for yourself or your family?
[00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:06.409]  We're ending the year.
[00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:07.770]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.790]  It's been an insane year.
[00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:17.655]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:29.681]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:31.522]  And that the globalists
[00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:38.905]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:44.367]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[00:16:44.907 --> 00:16:47.028]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.349]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.870]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.291]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:58.772]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.533]  But our aircraft didn't have
[00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:05.449]  Radar.
[00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:16.715]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:27.460]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:30.482]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[00:17:31.499 --> 00:17:34.540]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.643]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:48.684]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[00:17:49.085 --> 00:17:51.405]  That's a separate battle.
[00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:53.206]  And so...
[00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.132]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[00:18:00.652 --> 00:18:03.414]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:09.656]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:18.220]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[00:18:20.081 --> 00:18:23.703]  And we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most.
[00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:30.395]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:34.342]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[00:18:35.436 --> 00:18:44.243]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[00:18:44.663 --> 00:18:57.652]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[00:18:57.872 --> 00:18:59.614]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:06.783]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.861]  Until January 1st.
[00:19:09.562 --> 00:19:11.263]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support.
[00:19:11.923 --> 00:19:14.786]  Selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:18.769]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:22.592]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything.
[00:19:23.432 --> 00:19:25.214]  Double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:19:25.614 --> 00:19:26.875]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:30.518]  That is extended, but only a few days left until...
[00:19:31.818 --> 00:19:32.619]  The end of this year.
[00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:45.306]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off storewide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:51.150]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver, or something like that.
[00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.834]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[00:19:57.234 --> 00:19:58.715]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:19:58.895 --> 00:20:00.516]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.761]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:29.622]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:20:30.283 --> 00:20:32.545]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:35.368]  Run on for a long time.
[00:20:36.088 --> 00:20:38.511]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.514]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:20:43.024 --> 00:20:45.825]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:46.186]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:46.706]  I'm here live.
[00:20:46.786 --> 00:20:47.686]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:49.427]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:20:49.507 --> 00:20:51.388]  Okay, let's get right into it.
[00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:12.638]  There is a global program, there is a global operation to establish a planetary world government whose aim is ending war by ending the mass of humanity.
[00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:26.622]  And the answer is bring in world government, have controlled wars, have controlled bioweapons released, cull the populations down to a manageable 400 million is the public number put out by the UN.
[00:21:27.082 --> 00:21:30.624]  Again, more internal documents say 10,000 maybe.
[00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:33.766]  Those people are going to merge the machines and become gods.
[00:21:34.807 --> 00:21:37.028]  And I told you this decades ago, now it's in the news.
[00:21:37.448 --> 00:21:42.270]  The philosophy of the elite, stewards of the earth by reducing population.
[00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:44.391]  And they believe humanity's obsolete.
[00:21:44.431 --> 00:21:47.293]  They will soon merge with silicon and become gods.
[00:21:48.873 --> 00:21:50.954]  This is the cult we're fighting.
[00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:56.677]  But to do that metaphysically, they've got to say, oh, vaccines!
[00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.998]  And then add things to vaccines.
[00:21:59.978 --> 00:22:03.480]  It's compartmentalized where the doctors and scientists aren't even aware of it in most cases.
[00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:19.757]  But then people see the convulsions, the deaths, the cancer, the autism, and then they have a project to manage that and handle that and get the public used, incrementally, to having mass death take place all around them.
[00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:33.285]  So when they first started coming out with cell phone radiation technology 40 years ago, it was already old technology then, there were studies and articles out about how it would vibrate DNA and cause massive DNA damage.
[00:22:33.325 --> 00:22:34.485]  That's what a microwave does.
[00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:37.606]  It rubs molecules together and then heats them up.
[00:22:38.546 --> 00:22:39.987]  So it creates a friction like that.
[00:22:41.367 --> 00:22:46.609]  And they just began to increase it out from that point.
[00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:55.154]  And they noticed testicular cancer in things and truck drivers and other people that would have the old, more high-powered cell phones between their legs.
[00:22:56.715 --> 00:22:58.935]  So they started telling them, hey, don't keep that thing between your legs.
[00:22:59.615 --> 00:23:01.376]  So we have all the old studies.
[00:23:02.556 --> 00:23:16.159]  And then as new studies come out showing increased cancer as the radiation gets stronger, their argument is, well, you've been warned about it, kind of like on the side of a package of cigarettes, it tells you it can give you cancer or cause birth defects.
[00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:19.431]  But see, children aren't opting into this.
[00:23:20.091 --> 00:23:21.012]  And many adults aren't.
[00:23:21.472 --> 00:23:28.038]  But many schools, as you know, put the cell phone towers that are super powerful up on top of the facilities, and they make money off that.
[00:23:28.639 --> 00:23:30.480]  There's been a big pushback, so they've had to back off.
[00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:40.849]  I remember 20 years ago, again, talking about how they were going to put smart meters on the side of your house, and how they were going to spy on you, and how they were going to rip you off.
[00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:41.790]  And now it's all admitted.
[00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:43.612]  And now it's ubiquitous.
[00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.992]  Now they say if you want power, period, you've got to have one of these.
[00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:52.254]  So they're going from making you opt-in to where it's just the way it is.
[00:23:56.275 --> 00:24:12.143]  And so whether it's electricity, or whether it's radiation, whether it's sulfur radiation, it's particles, charged particles, charged wavelengths, blasting out the spectrum and affecting your body in a very damaging way.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.722]  You know, every airline pilot I know is aware of this, no matter how great a shape they were in.
[00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:24.124]  You notice the elite pilots all like to fly at night now.
[00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:29.507]  The big global flights that are 10, 15, 18 hours long are launched at night.
[00:24:30.127 --> 00:24:32.348]  And it's not so you sleep on the plane, boys and girls.
[00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:39.891]  It's because the pilots are refusing to fly the airplanes during the day because there's a water shield up to about 20,000 feet.
[00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:42.473]  I think?
[00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:07.138]  It's the equivalent of many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many chest x-rays.
[00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:18.691]  And airlines even looked 20 years ago into putting lead shielding, but then it would be so expensive and it would emit the radiation that they decided to not do it.
[00:25:21.249 --> 00:25:27.153]  But I mean, I know airline pilots that were in the Air Force 25 years ago that looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:25:27.774 --> 00:25:29.895]  And now they look like they've been in a microwave oven.
[00:25:30.075 --> 00:25:31.296]  They've had dozens of cancers.
[00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:32.817]  And they'll tell you, oh, we're all like this.
[00:25:33.118 --> 00:25:35.359]  And they're sunken in, and their eyes are gone.
[00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:37.521]  It doesn't matter if you wear sunglasses, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:37.801 --> 00:25:41.664]  And they've got cancer all over their body because they've been in space.
[00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:46.167]  Above 20,000 feet, baby, you're in space.
[00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.529]  The gravity still holds you into the Earth, but you're in space.
[00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.210]  Ba-ba.
[00:25:52.042 --> 00:25:53.642]  You're above the real atmosphere.
[00:25:55.903 --> 00:25:58.804]  And so all I'm getting in here is I could talk for 100 hours on this.
[00:26:00.304 --> 00:26:04.466]  But we live in a very small, thin environment on the surface of the Earth.
[00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:08.227]  And most people live below 15,000 feet for a reason.
[00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:12.988]  And just air travel
[00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:16.710]  And you're like, why are all the flights suddenly at night?
[00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.372]  Because the more, you know, the big jets, the big elite pilots, they like living.
[00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:28.135]  Now, let's move on to our children and 5G.
[00:26:29.115 --> 00:26:32.517]  One of the few areas Trump's really doing a bad job on, but he's just all about innovation.
[00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:34.058]  They tell him it's great and he can't see it.
[00:26:34.098 --> 00:26:36.459]  He drinks Diet Coke and he likes Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:39.340]  He's super blue collar.
[00:26:42.383 --> 00:26:45.324]  You know, blue-collar folks, they like to smoke cigarettes, they like to eat Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:26:45.344 --> 00:26:47.805]  You know, it's kind of that attitude.
[00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:48.766]  Tough guy stuff.
[00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:52.127]  But now the 5G's coming in, taxpayer-funded.
[00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:57.329]  There's not just a race with China to put this stuff in, because it can surveil everything you're doing in your house.
[00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:00.530]  Literally look through walls, but also grab all your data.
[00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:09.114]  But they even have LA Times, Wired Magazine, all of them admitting that it's causing massive cancer in all the studies in rats.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:13.275]  Much worse than the old technology, because it's a lot stronger.
[00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:13.775]  Wow!
[00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:18.598]  Something's 20, 30, 40 times stronger, and the old stuff gave you cancer.
[00:27:18.658 --> 00:27:19.579]  What's this gonna do?
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.882]  It's like smoking filterless cigarettes versus filtered, but much worse.
[00:27:24.902 --> 00:27:35.128]  Then I've got all the stacks of news here, where they know it's killing us, but they're going ahead with it, and it's done on purpose.
[00:27:35.449 --> 00:27:35.989]  Well, guess what?
[00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:39.031]  Everybody has a right to not be living under this.
[00:27:39.994 --> 00:27:42.035]  And people have to organize, they have to say no now.
[00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:48.499]  Because it's going to become more and more evident as the autism and the brain damage and the cancer is all exploding.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:56.083]  That just like vaccines that they're spiking on record, they've been called all the world, the UN has, with sterilants and cancer viruses.
[00:27:56.303 --> 00:27:57.244]  Most cancer is viral.
[00:27:58.144 --> 00:28:01.446]  Your body beats it all the time, but then when your immune system gives up, then you're dead.
[00:28:03.428 --> 00:28:07.550]  And it's also a deal with cells replicating as they've replicated so many times and they have more mutations.
[00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.191]  But that's the secondary type of cancer.
[00:28:10.811 --> 00:28:11.872]  Most cancer is viral.
[00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:14.133]  The Rockefeller Foundation discovered it in the 20s.
[00:28:16.234 --> 00:28:18.034]  JFK discovered the research, tried to kill it.
[00:28:18.515 --> 00:28:23.937]  That's even in the JFK movie, that they were getting weaponized cancer out of New Orleans that they'd developed.
[00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:25.518]  Injectable.
[00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:30.180]  And they want you to opt into the vaccine, too.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.201]  Metaphysically, you've got to opt into the 5G.
[00:28:32.801 --> 00:28:34.082]  You've got to opt into the vaccine.
[00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:36.083]  They want you to opt in.
[00:28:36.183 --> 00:28:37.403]  Because then, oh, they didn't kill you.
[00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:38.384]  You opted into it.
[00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.852]  So we got a special guest joining us.
[00:28:42.412 --> 00:28:46.814]  He'll be with us into the next hour, but I'm going to go to him about five minutes into the next segment.
[00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:49.415]  I have to finish this when we come back.
[00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:58.619]  And then we'll look at the big globalist attack on China and why it's been chosen by the NWO to be the center and the seat of world government.
[00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:00.439]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.241]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:29:05.404 --> 00:29:16.053]  The number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a patriot and a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones'd right now in front of all of us.
[00:29:16.653 --> 00:29:27.482]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:36.005]  In fact, it came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:37.967]  He was right under me on the list.
[00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:44.333]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson.
[00:29:44.353 --> 00:29:44.674]  That's why.
[00:29:45.987 --> 00:29:47.469]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[00:29:47.649 --> 00:29:50.312]  And I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[00:29:50.913 --> 00:29:53.896]  He was already, obviously, covering all that on air.
[00:29:54.777 --> 00:29:58.241]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[00:29:58.821 --> 00:30:02.646]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:11.515]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:18.899]  And the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:25.444]  But today we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the U.S.
[00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:41.434]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[00:30:42.754 --> 00:30:44.335]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[00:30:45.096 --> 00:30:49.959]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes unaccompanied.
[00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:53.741]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[00:30:54.991 --> 00:31:01.654]  If we go back to 10 years ago, it seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about 8-9 million viewers a night.
[00:31:02.214 --> 00:31:04.215]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[00:31:04.556 --> 00:31:05.876]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[00:31:06.817 --> 00:31:07.677]  And what was he talking about?
[00:31:07.797 --> 00:31:12.219]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:13.380]  He was going off their own documents.
[00:31:14.548 --> 00:31:15.950]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[00:31:30.626 --> 00:31:36.568]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:41.050]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.031]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[00:31:45.451 --> 00:31:47.912]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[00:31:48.512 --> 00:31:51.873]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[00:31:52.014 --> 00:31:58.776]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[00:31:59.403 --> 00:32:05.585]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:11.866]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[00:32:11.946 --> 00:32:17.648]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas, because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:22.586]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:32.570]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous, where San Francisco jury is letting an illegal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white.
[00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.931]  We have diversity signal.
[00:32:34.651 --> 00:32:35.692]  This is the real cancer.
[00:32:36.493 --> 00:32:45.521]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds at gay bars, have little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[00:32:45.541 --> 00:32:51.226]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[00:32:52.027 --> 00:32:54.549]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.092]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:32:57.272 --> 00:32:59.214]  Just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[00:33:06.545 --> 00:33:11.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.791 --> 00:33:20.352]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:20.492 --> 00:33:25.615]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:38.376]  Steven W. Mosier joins us via video.
[00:33:38.396 --> 00:33:39.897]  Skyper going to him for just a moment.
[00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.320]  He'll ride shotgun with us about 20 minutes in the next hour.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.241]  And he's an expert on China.
[00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:45.242]  Lived there many years.
[00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:46.944]  Pop.org.
[00:33:47.705 --> 00:33:48.626]  He's worked with the U.S.
[00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:49.666]  government, other governments.
[00:33:50.768 --> 00:33:51.748]  My understanding, China.
[00:33:52.654 --> 00:33:57.660]  And again, he witnessed what's really going on in the nation for a long time.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:09.132]  I mean, I'll let him recap his awakening as a liberal over there and actually seeing what the left was embracing and why they thought Communist China was so great and how it is America's great rival.
[00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:13.234]  He is the best-selling author of Bully of Asia.
[00:34:13.894 --> 00:34:16.015]  And he wrote a big article for the New York Post.
[00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:17.035]  That's excellent.
[00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:17.936]  We're going to be getting into.
[00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.557]  And he can also speak about 5G.
[00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:24.918]  But let's finish up just with the documentation, if you're a viewer or listener.
[00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:31.040]  Just like there are some cliffs in Austin that are about a thousand feet tall.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.501]  They're not really mountains, but they call them Mount Bonnell and Mount this, Mount that.
[00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:35.722]  They look like little mountains.
[00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:38.923]  You can go up to the edge of a cliff and you can't see gravity.
[00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:45.963]  But everybody knows, if you jump off, when you hit the bottom in 20 seconds, you're gonna wish you were dead, or you're gonna be dead.
[00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:46.764]  You'll probably be dead.
[00:34:47.444 --> 00:34:48.664]  About 95% of the time.
[00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:52.306]  Maybe you hit a tree or something, or bounce on your way down, you're gonna live.
[00:34:54.587 --> 00:34:57.528]  Now, you can't see gravity, but the planet has it.
[00:34:57.548 --> 00:34:58.468]  We're in a gravity well.
[00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:00.189]  We know how it works.
[00:35:00.669 --> 00:35:04.631]  Big things have gravity, and they suck little things onto their surface.
[00:35:05.431 --> 00:35:05.551]  Now,
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:09.068]  I've got literally U.N.
[00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:10.709]  studies, Chinese studies, U.S.
[00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:13.451]  studies, British studies, telecom studies going back 30 years.
[00:35:13.951 --> 00:35:15.612]  I had them print me whole stacks of these today.
[00:35:16.473 --> 00:35:21.716]  You can just type it in, and it's confirmed, confirmed, gives rats cancer, gives rats cancer, confirmed.
[00:35:21.756 --> 00:35:26.158]  All these new tumors that kill so many people, right on the side of your head you use the cell phone.
[00:35:26.519 --> 00:35:27.659]  They rattle DNA.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:33.543]  Big studies that five minutes of cell phone use against the head raises brain temperature one degree.
[00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:36.805]  It actually heats your brain up.
[00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:39.797]  Now, what does radiation do?
[00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:42.699]  What does microwave radiation do?
[00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:47.623]  When you put a cup of water in it and turn it on for a minute, what makes it hot?
[00:35:47.763 --> 00:35:50.546]  The molecules rub together.
[00:35:51.687 --> 00:35:53.969]  It cooks your brain.
[00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:55.931]  So, here's Wired Magazine.
[00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:57.612]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[00:35:58.693 --> 00:36:00.455]  Big Wireless doesn't want you to know.
[00:36:01.747 --> 00:36:06.949]  EU reflex study shows DNA damage caused by radiation from wireless devices and mobile phones.
[00:36:07.229 --> 00:36:09.210]  This is from the UN themselves.
[00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.170]  Confirmed!
[00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.631]  Mobile phones break DNA.
[00:36:12.731 --> 00:36:13.931]  Scrambled genomes.
[00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:15.332]  Scrambled genome?
[00:36:15.372 --> 00:36:16.792]  What happens when your genome gets scrambled?
[00:36:16.812 --> 00:36:17.852]  It has a name.
[00:36:18.072 --> 00:36:19.373]  It's called cancer.
[00:36:22.176 --> 00:36:23.196]  And it just goes on.
[00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:24.237]  Oh, LA Times.
[00:36:24.277 --> 00:36:26.097]  Well, it causes cancer, but no big deal.
[00:36:26.658 --> 00:36:30.279]  5G service is coming, and so are health concerns at the towers that support it.
[00:36:30.779 --> 00:36:32.140]  Oh yeah, the towers are really bad.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.540]  The cell phones are bad enough.
[00:36:34.581 --> 00:36:36.921]  So, at least there's some consciousness to this.
[00:36:37.882 --> 00:36:41.643]  And then, oh, how adding iodine to salt boosted Americans' IQ.
[00:36:42.623 --> 00:36:43.804]  That's even New York Times.
[00:36:45.816 --> 00:36:49.379]  In raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt, the iodine.
[00:36:50.279 --> 00:36:50.960]  Oh, but the U.S.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.201]  took it out of the salt.
[00:36:52.241 --> 00:36:53.201]  We don't want that.
[00:36:54.402 --> 00:36:55.323]  But China, they had it.
[00:36:55.903 --> 00:36:56.144]  See?
[00:36:56.884 --> 00:37:02.308]  So, everything that's being done to the West, the culture, all of it, is to literally dumb us down.
[00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:04.690]  Make us stupid.
[00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.111]  Make us totally sick.
[00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:06.871]  We're not outside.
[00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:07.552]  We're not in the dirt.
[00:37:07.752 --> 00:37:08.392]  Here's another article.
[00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:13.036]  Bacteria found in dirt stops growth of superbugs, resists antibiotics.
[00:37:14.192 --> 00:37:16.654]  It's the Sashawan University, linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:37:16.994 --> 00:37:21.457]  Oh, if you let your kids play in the dirt and they're outside more, then suddenly you won't need all those antibiotics.
[00:37:21.837 --> 00:37:29.081]  I mean, my dad's really smart black nanny said to my grandmother when he was getting sick as a baby, she says, Ms.
[00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:30.562]  Jones, you're going to kill that baby.
[00:37:31.203 --> 00:37:32.363]  You need to let him play in the dirt.
[00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:32.964]  He's too clean.
[00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:36.606]  You make me clean him all the time, all the rest of it, and he gets sick all the time.
[00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:38.747]  Of course, she then gave him what she called Hindu tea.
[00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:46.845]  Snuck it later, told my grandmother, which was boiled chicken manure, which turns out to be the best antibacterial out there, but gives your body immunity.
[00:37:47.045 --> 00:37:50.947]  He didn't get sick anymore because she boiled chicken crap and fed it to him.
[00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:53.889]  But everybody knew this in the old times.
[00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:55.470]  We've just forgotten it now.
[00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.072]  So the answer is let your kids play in the dirt, not putting them on antibiotics every day.
[00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:01.753]  But the system knows this.
[00:38:01.793 --> 00:38:03.014]  So they're letting you opt in.
[00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:04.715]  The question is, why are they?
[00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:06.236]  Doing this.
[00:38:07.097 --> 00:38:08.659]  Why are they carrying this out?
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.882]  Why is this being allowed?
[00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:13.225]  Because there could be good, clean vaccines, but they're not.
[00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:19.613]  There could be, again, communication systems that aren't as damaging, but they go for the worst.
[00:38:20.414 --> 00:38:20.654]  What's...
[00:38:21.255 --> 00:38:25.098]  Going on here is the larger question.
[00:38:25.499 --> 00:38:28.862]  Now, his book, I read it a couple years ago when it came out, but it's more important than ever.
[00:38:29.202 --> 00:38:33.266]  Bully of Asia, Why China's Dream is the New Threat to World Order.
[00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:36.148]  And I'm not going to go over Mr. Moser's entire background.
[00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:37.750]  We're going to get more into China in the next segment.
[00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.291]  But briefly, since I'm getting into 5G,
[00:38:40.912 --> 00:38:41.553]  Good to be here, Alex.
[00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:41.873]  Enjoy your time.
[00:39:01.315 --> 00:39:03.136]  Yeah, I'm a subscriber.
[00:39:03.636 --> 00:39:09.159]  I was unhappy when YouTube and Big Tech decided that they were going to censor you.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:15.303]  So I responded by subscribing to InfoWars and by encouraging my friends to do so as well.
[00:39:15.343 --> 00:39:16.343]  So thank you, my friend.
[00:39:17.004 --> 00:39:18.244]  Well, I appreciate you, brother.
[00:39:18.284 --> 00:39:23.247]  You know, I noticed when I criticized Apple and Google moving to China this year that that's when the hammer fell.
[00:39:25.373 --> 00:39:26.333]  Yeah.
[00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:33.715]  And they're in trouble because they're in league with a country that wants to dominate not only its own people, but the world.
[00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:40.856]  You know, the Chinese have a system now to monitor 1.4 billion people in their own country.
[00:39:41.636 --> 00:39:46.557]  And they'd like to apply that system to everybody in the world, all seven plus billion of us.
[00:39:47.097 --> 00:39:49.318]  And that's why they're selling these Huawei phones.
[00:39:49.358 --> 00:39:55.139]  That's why they want to set up 5G connections everywhere, because it's a great, great
[00:39:55.834 --> 00:39:57.755]  Data Gathering Enterprise.
[00:39:57.955 --> 00:40:12.284]  It's a great big vacuum cleaner that vacuums up data about where you were born, what your name is, what your face looks like, so they can use face recognition technology, where your bank accounts are, everything they want to compile into one huge database.
[00:40:12.364 --> 00:40:18.568]  And once they have it, of course, they'll be in a position to pressure us in ways that we can only imagine in a horror story now.
[00:40:20.174 --> 00:40:25.365]  And you've been speaking about this forever, so people know about your curriculum vitae, specifically in the School of Life.
[00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:31.337]  In the next few minutes, recap how you got to China, why you went there, and what you discovered in your awakening.
[00:40:32.418 --> 00:40:36.961]  Well, I was the first American allowed to go to China back in 1979, a long time ago.
[00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:41.024]  That's when China was first, what we called it, opening up to the West.
[00:40:41.404 --> 00:40:50.691]  Of course, that opening to the West was a way of getting, stealing, begging, borrowing, stealing Western technology and overtaking us so they could dominate us.
[00:40:51.271 --> 00:40:52.452]  But we were hopeful at the time.
[00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:53.233]  I wound up in a
[00:40:53.753 --> 00:41:11.401]  In a commune in South China, learned very quickly from the people in the commune that communes don't work, that people produce best when they're in family units with family-owned enterprises, providing for themselves and their family and their neighbors, not for the distant government bureaucracy, not for the state.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.623]  But it was a real wake-up call.
[00:41:14.103 --> 00:41:25.340]  My friends in the local village took me to a local hill, which was known as Turtle Mountain, where all of the people who were associated with the old regime were taken and shot in the early 50s.
[00:41:25.821 --> 00:41:27.564]  Simply shot dead without a trial.
[00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:40.738]  Then they took me to a mass grave and that was filled in 1961 and 1962 with the bodies of 400 people who had died during the great Mao Zedong Chairman Mao famine of that year.
[00:41:40.978 --> 00:41:42.298]  They created great communes.
[00:41:42.358 --> 00:41:50.683]  They couldn't feed the people with the produce from the communes and 400 people died in my commune alone.
[00:41:50.803 --> 00:41:53.284]  And of course, throughout China, 45 million people died.
[00:41:53.864 --> 00:41:56.626]  But the real wake up call was when I was in the operating room.
[00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:08.669]  Where they were arresting and bringing in to receive forced abortions women who were illegally pregnant with second children or third children.
[00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:13.891]  Illegal, of course, because the Communist Party had declared these babies to be illegal.
[00:42:14.912 --> 00:42:21.735]  The mothers of these babies were arrested, brought in, tied down on operating tables and given cesarean section abortions.
[00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:22.675]  If you can imagine that.
[00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:24.012]  Think about that.
[00:42:24.052 --> 00:42:37.974]  Think about your wife being arrested for the crime of being pregnant illegally, taken by force by Communist Party officials to a local dirty little clinic, and they're tied down on an operating table.
[00:42:38.738 --> 00:42:48.266]  And given an abortion by Red Army doctors who were brought in from the nearby army base because the local doctors refused to do these operations.
[00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:51.128]  They knew these people were their friends and neighbors.
[00:42:51.649 --> 00:42:54.831]  And so they had to bring in, the Communist Party did have to bring in Red Army.
[00:42:54.871 --> 00:42:56.132]  Stephen W. Mosier, stay right there.
[00:42:56.192 --> 00:42:58.374]  Let's talk about this.
[00:42:58.434 --> 00:42:59.475]  It's a powerful story.
[00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:00.976]  You're going in-depth into it.
[00:43:01.737 --> 00:43:03.058]  What happened?
[00:43:03.538 --> 00:43:06.080]  Since the time of Plato, 2,300 plus years ago,
[00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:12.327]  Elites believe that the Earth was overpopulated.
[00:43:13.348 --> 00:43:21.674]  Now, you could argue that today, but in the time of Plato, there wasn't more than a hundred thousand people on the Greek islands.
[00:43:22.815 --> 00:43:28.320]  But in his Republic, he wrote about humans crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[00:43:29.821 --> 00:43:30.842]  And it was his ideas
[00:43:32.754 --> 00:43:36.495]  2,000 years later, they were picked up by Malthus.
[00:43:37.475 --> 00:43:38.116]  Sir Malthus.
[00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:49.978]  Malthus wanted to herd people in Ireland and in England to pour people into tiny, small, 200-foot apartments so that they would fester with disease and die.
[00:43:49.998 --> 00:43:52.679]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[00:43:52.699 --> 00:43:55.720]  That means you just believe in making things worse.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.341]  So that you get rid of the poor people, you get rid of the dumb people, you get rid of the stupid people.
[00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:09.904]  He predicted that within a hundred years, that was the 1700s, he predicted by the 1800s, the Earth would reach its carrying potential.
[00:44:09.924 --> 00:44:14.985]  And there would be a planetary collapse of the entire human population.
[00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:23.608]  So when you hear about eugenics, and you read about the UN saying we're overpopulated, and you see them pushing for global one-child policies,
[00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:35.826]  Remember that this has been a long-term view of aristocrats, of royalty, of oligarchs, of plutocrats for 2,000 plus years.
[00:44:36.927 --> 00:44:42.392]  And really what they use this for is a way to dehumanize the general public.
[00:44:43.053 --> 00:44:43.813]  Why educate?
[00:44:43.893 --> 00:44:44.894]  Why have sewage?
[00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:48.377]  Why have sanitation if these people are animals to begin with?
[00:44:49.538 --> 00:44:55.763]  But see, once sanitation and things were adopted 150 years ago, infectious diseases went down over 95%.
[00:44:56.584 --> 00:44:59.146]  So then the eugenicists met and they said, what are we going to do?
[00:45:00.146 --> 00:45:03.269]  People aren't dying from infectious diseases, the Malthusian plant's failing.
[00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:08.593]  They said, we'll take all these good scientists and people that have developed all these vaccines and things that are good.
[00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:14.234]  And we'll take control of these with modern medical science through the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:45:14.935 --> 00:45:17.635]  And we'll actually control it and make everything worse.
[00:45:18.396 --> 00:45:20.256]  Cancer was incredibly rare 100 years ago.
[00:45:20.896 --> 00:45:24.717]  By the 20s, the Rockefellers had discovered most of it was viral and weaponized it.
[00:45:25.477 --> 00:45:27.038]  And there's hundreds of other examples.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:38.322]  So when you pull back from this and understand that it's not that environmentalism is bad, it's good, but the bad guys run it, not to help the earth or people, but to control it.
[00:45:38.762 --> 00:45:44.903]  When you realize that vaccine technology is good and real, but that bad guys have it and are adding Trojan horses, then you understand.
[00:45:45.663 --> 00:45:51.784]  Just like computers are good, but then they can be used for bad with Trojan horses to control.
[00:45:51.804 --> 00:45:55.905]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:45:57.225 --> 00:45:58.847]  That's why you have an attack on the family.
[00:45:59.088 --> 00:46:00.590]  That's why you have an attack on the middle class.
[00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.815]  That's why globalists want to make populations poor and stupid and controllable.
[00:46:05.536 --> 00:46:08.099]  Because only one level of the eugenics operation
[00:46:09.594 --> 00:46:11.536]  It says they're actually just going to get rid of the poor people.
[00:46:12.297 --> 00:46:12.957]  That's bad enough.
[00:46:13.498 --> 00:46:21.425]  The truth is they're just using it as an excuse to humanize all life, throw chivalry out the window, and treat their fellow humans like they're animals.
[00:46:22.266 --> 00:46:29.412]  Because the globalists are sociopathic and psychotic in their spectrum, and they project their own hatred on the public.
[00:46:30.353 --> 00:46:50.329]  And their own loathing of themselves on the public, and then cover it, claiming that they're nothing but social Darwinists, carrying out a cleansing of the Earth, when they're the ones with the open-air genetic engineering, they're the ones with the gene splicing, they're the ones with the human-animal chimeras, they're the ones with the atmospheric manipulations, when they're the ones endangering the entire planet.
[00:46:51.129 --> 00:46:52.871]  So as we go into the new year, understand this.
[00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:53.691]  A 2,300-year plan
[00:46:56.053 --> 00:46:58.195]  He's fighting against a plan for a pro-human future.
[00:46:58.555 --> 00:46:59.936]  Choose Renaissance, not death.
[00:47:00.236 --> 00:47:01.277]  Choose Infowars.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.022]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.674 --> 00:47:26.843]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:27.604 --> 00:47:29.047]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.177 --> 00:47:46.122]  Stephen W. Mosier really was one of the first people allowed in by the communists.
[00:47:46.162 --> 00:47:49.945]  Chinese actually lived there and sent to one of their communists because he was a leftist, a liberal.
[00:47:50.786 --> 00:47:52.787]  He was a well-meaning one.
[00:47:53.067 --> 00:48:09.581]  My dad said when he was in college, before that in the 60s, that they were already priming him that China was the future, China was the way to go, and they had Chinese research scientists over here that my dad was working with even in high school, and MD Anderson, but that's a whole other story.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:22.363]  But the globalists chose China as the model for the world, took it from nowhere with no running water in 95% of the country to the industrial and technological juggernaut that it is now.
[00:48:22.883 --> 00:48:32.965]  But it's powerful how Mr. Mosier, who became one of the leading people for orphanages, you name it, in China, had his epiphany from the people themselves.
[00:48:33.045 --> 00:48:34.485]  People think the Chinese are monolithic.
[00:48:35.166 --> 00:48:35.726]  No, they're not.
[00:48:35.786 --> 00:48:37.106]  Not the Taiwanese, not many.
[00:48:37.146 --> 00:48:40.607]  In fact, I can hardly buy Chinese food for myself.
[00:48:42.008 --> 00:48:51.690]  When I go in a Chinese place in Houston or Austin or New York, I was in a Chinese food restaurant last night and they were trying to keep me from paying.
[00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.031]  And they had, of course, Epoch Times being sold at the front.
[00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:59.612]  So most of the Chinese people that are out of China absolutely know how horrible it is.
[00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:00.792]  And they're free market people.
[00:49:01.052 --> 00:49:02.392]  They used to be Christian, a lot of them.
[00:49:02.632 --> 00:49:04.272]  They get killed or Buddhist.
[00:49:04.332 --> 00:49:07.173]  And where's the left saying a word?
[00:49:07.193 --> 00:49:08.133]  I mean, imagine Hitler.
[00:49:08.853 --> 00:49:10.374]  Everybody overuses Hitler.
[00:49:10.474 --> 00:49:11.154]  Oh, it's like Hitler.
[00:49:11.194 --> 00:49:11.674]  It's like Hitler.
[00:49:12.588 --> 00:49:22.594]  But if there was a Hitler around who was still in government, or let's say Hitler died but the Nazis were still in power in Europe, and they were still killing people en masse, you'd be concerned about it.
[00:49:22.654 --> 00:49:23.614]  But not China.
[00:49:23.754 --> 00:49:31.658]  And instead, they're bringing their technology that's been proven to have all these spy chips, all these controls, and are buying off our universities, our governments.
[00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:41.304]  Well, Stephen W. Mosier has been one of the only other big voices out there, other than myself and Bill Gertz, and a few others, who have talked about
[00:49:42.694 --> 00:50:01.671]  What the CFR has said, what the globalists have said, that they're selling us out to China, that they have been holding their hand and positioning them, and now it's finally in the news that they've got spy ships and they're taking Kenya's only port, and they've got 98% of rare earth minerals, and they've got all the major, they've been positioned by traders as part of a larger plan.
[00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:05.394]  We'll talk about that next hour, and get into 5G and his huge article.
[00:50:06.134 --> 00:50:07.535]  That's gone totally viral.
[00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:20.358]  It was like one of the top stories last week, when Drudge Report linked to it, about the Chinese Communist master plan and this dynastic royalty, basically, of the party that got arrested.
[00:50:20.718 --> 00:50:24.239]  How arrest of Chinese princess exposes regime's world domination plot.
[00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:28.681]  So we'll get into that in the 30 minutes next hour, but your personal story is so powerful.
[00:50:29.381 --> 00:50:29.881]  Finish up.
[00:50:30.721 --> 00:50:31.402]  You're awakening.
[00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:32.323]  I don't want to speak for you.
[00:50:32.343 --> 00:50:32.923]  Were you a liberal?
[00:50:32.943 --> 00:50:33.544]  Were you a leftist?
[00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:38.608]  The point was, you meant well, but you drank the Kool-Aid, because I've read your book, and I've had you on several times.
[00:50:39.048 --> 00:50:43.432]  But you describe it best, who you were, and then hopefully other liberals will wake up out there.
[00:50:44.713 --> 00:50:48.495]  Well, I was I was a doctoral candidate at Stanford University.
[00:50:48.575 --> 00:50:52.657]  I was teaching Chinese studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
[00:50:52.697 --> 00:51:07.183]  And yeah, I'd read all the books that were published in the 60s and 70s praising Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party for their claims that they had ended poverty, they had improved the lives of the people in the countryside.
[00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:21.118]  You know, it was typical left-wing illusions, delusions we should say, about a brutal, thuggish, communist regime that when you looked up close and personal, these weren't very nice people.
[00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.319]  This was the new party.
[00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:23.300]  This was the elite.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.764]  These were people who kept the masses oppressed.
[00:51:26.964 --> 00:51:29.186]  They didn't rise up the masses.
[00:51:29.226 --> 00:51:29.607]  They kept
[00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:34.049]  The ordinary people of Preston and they of course have the best of everything.
[00:51:34.129 --> 00:51:43.072]  The now today 90 million members of the Chinese Communist Party absolutely dominate the 1.4 billion Chinese.
[00:51:43.412 --> 00:51:44.653]  They get the best of everything.
[00:51:44.993 --> 00:51:57.198]  Most of the money that's been generated by the export sector of the Chinese economy, which is the only sector of the economy that works by the way, the rest of the Chinese economy is clunky state-owned dinosaurs
[00:51:57.658 --> 00:51:57.758]  Yeah.
[00:52:10.387 --> 00:52:11.048]  Good to go.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:38.567]  And one by one, late at night, usually over a glass of rice wine, they would begin to tell me these horror stories of life under the commune.
[00:52:38.767 --> 00:52:41.009]  You know what they call the Chinese Communist Party?
[00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:42.730]  They call it the Big Landlord.
[00:52:43.516 --> 00:52:52.744]  The Chinese Communist Party and the Red Army came in, killed all the small landlords, the landowners, lined them up over there at that little mountain that I talked about and shot them dead.
[00:52:53.165 --> 00:52:54.746]  But it became the big landlord.
[00:52:54.806 --> 00:52:55.887]  It controlled everything.
[00:52:55.947 --> 00:53:05.256]  The people were producing goods, silk and sugarcane and other things that they were forced to sell to the Chinese Communist Party at fire sale prices.
[00:53:05.536 --> 00:53:07.778]  So they remained poor while the party got rich.
[00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:30.418]  But this one-child policy, I have to tell you about that, Alex, because to see women who are seven, eight, nine months pregnant, and in some cases only days or hours away from giving birth, arrested for the imaginary crime of being pregnant without the permission of the Chinese Communist Party, and then taken away by party officials,
[00:53:30.859 --> 00:53:39.124]  In front of the horrified parents, brothers, sisters, husbands and children of these women, taken away by force.
[00:53:39.705 --> 00:53:41.546]  I went with them to the operating room.
[00:53:41.706 --> 00:53:52.053]  I was there when these women were opened up like tin cans by Caesarean section, by Red Army doctors who would then kill their babies by lethal injection.
[00:53:52.373 --> 00:53:53.474]  This is not abortion.
[00:53:54.175 --> 00:53:57.020]  Alex, as bad as that is, this is infanticide.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:02.149]  This was a killing of nearly full-term healthy babies at birth and there were cases.
[00:54:03.018 --> 00:54:08.703]  That the woman was so far advanced in labor that the baby's head was already crowning.
[00:54:09.043 --> 00:54:15.888]  The baby was already beginning to be born, and what the Red Army doctors did at that point is almost beyond describing.
[00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:26.717]  They would take a hypodermic needle, they would fill it with formaldehyde or alcohol, and they would give the baby a lethal injection into the soft spot of the baby's skull.
[00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:30.663]  Um, killing the baby instantly after it was born.
[00:54:30.963 --> 00:54:42.030]  Now let's be clear, here in America they call it partial birth, but the women volunteer for it, and the baby, under law, cannot leave the canal, or it's a live birth, you can't kill them, though they still do it.
[00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:47.513]  They use a high-powered suction vacuum to punch a hole in the head and suck the brains out.
[00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:54.318]  Yeah, we can't claim any moral superiority over the Chinese in that sense.
[00:54:54.398 --> 00:54:57.680]  I mean, in one sense, we're a democratic country.
[00:54:59.021 --> 00:55:09.388]  We elected the men who appointed the judges who allowed the abortion doctors to go in to the sanctity of the womb with their knives and their suction equipment and kill unborn children.
[00:55:09.768 --> 00:55:11.649]  So in a sense, we're doubly responsible.
[00:55:11.669 --> 00:55:12.530]  The Chinese women
[00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:19.171]  The Chinese families who were devastated by these forced abortions didn't elect these Communist Party leaders.
[00:55:19.211 --> 00:55:20.251]  These leaders... Exactly.
[00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:22.052]  So the evil is being forced on them.
[00:55:22.072 --> 00:55:24.692]  Let's expand on that and we're going to get into the big enchilada when we come back.
[00:55:24.732 --> 00:55:28.253]  The current state of the war with China and the traitors in our own government.
[00:55:28.573 --> 00:55:37.854]  And so Americans can pick which side and others around the world can pick which side they want to be on here with the author, best-selling author, bully of Asia, Stephen W. Mosier.
[00:55:38.174 --> 00:55:40.815]  Why China's Dream is the New Threat to World Order.
[00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:52.464]  The left, David Rockefeller, wrote huge op-eds in the New York Times, praising how great communism is, how wonderful it is.
[00:55:52.844 --> 00:55:54.165]  Why would the ultra-rich do this?
[00:55:54.205 --> 00:55:56.187]  And then why does the left love China?
[00:55:56.207 --> 00:56:04.873]  Because that's where you can really carry out the mass test, have a party that's ready to do it, and just use people like they're lower than animals.
[00:56:06.094 --> 00:56:11.802]  What was it like for you who had drunk the Kool-Aid, as you said, to actually then actually be on the ground?
[00:56:11.842 --> 00:56:12.563]  They trusted you.
[00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:16.528]  You were a fellow traveler, China Studies guy, so you were one of the first to come in.
[00:56:16.548 --> 00:56:18.731]  And then what was it like in the process?
[00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:21.134]  Did it come all at once or was it incremental?
[00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.756]  Well, it took me the better part of a year.
[00:56:24.856 --> 00:56:27.517]  I'm a slow learner when it comes to some very important things.
[00:56:27.597 --> 00:56:41.862]  But by the end of my year in China, I realized that the Chinese Communist Party was a party of tyrants, of thugs, really a mafia that had taken control of the entire country.
[00:56:42.742 --> 00:56:47.486]  And we're not really out for the Chinese people in any sense of the meaning of the word.
[00:56:47.546 --> 00:56:49.707]  They were simply out for themselves.
[00:56:49.787 --> 00:56:53.810]  They were a party that wanted to accumulate as much power and wealth as they could.
[00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:59.034]  But see, George Orwell was a leading socialist and then woke up because he actually got his hands dirty.
[00:56:59.054 --> 00:56:59.954]  You got your hands dirty.
[00:57:00.395 --> 00:57:01.235]  That's the problem now.
[00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:03.197]  So many leftists are in bubble world.
[00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:08.865]  You know, living in the high-rise apartment, going to college forever, on the internet, they never get their hands dirty.
[00:57:08.885 --> 00:57:14.353]  It seems like anybody that gets their hands dirty who isn't evil always starts fighting collectivism.
[00:57:15.919 --> 00:57:29.544]  Yeah, if I could take all of my Stanford University colleagues with me to China and let them live in China for a year, they would come away with a very different view of socialism, of communism in China.
[00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:32.565]  The trouble is they only see China from afar.
[00:57:32.985 --> 00:57:36.746]  They read the propaganda published by the Chinese regime.
[00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.707]  They're alienated from their own country, you see.
[00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:40.788]  That's the other problem.
[00:57:41.428 --> 00:57:45.230]  They're alienated from their own country, their own history, their own culture.
[00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.271]  They've been taught to despise their own history, their own culture.
[00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:49.372]  Let's talk about that!
[00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.333]  How were they inoculated to hate themselves?
[00:57:52.452 --> 00:57:53.052]  The Globalist!
[00:58:13.363 --> 00:58:22.746]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[00:58:23.526 --> 00:58:24.046]  It's that simple.
[00:58:24.707 --> 00:58:25.607]  So, it's epic.
[00:58:25.707 --> 00:58:26.327]  It's amazing.
[00:58:26.547 --> 00:58:28.048]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[00:58:28.628 --> 00:58:31.069]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[00:58:32.669 --> 00:58:33.810]  This is the stuff of legends.
[00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.773]  And I just want listeners to continue to understand something because it's the key.
[00:58:38.353 --> 00:58:40.675]  You are not just part of the info war.
[00:58:41.235 --> 00:58:41.875]  You're the core.
[00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:42.476]  You're the heart.
[00:58:42.576 --> 00:58:43.216]  You're everything.
[00:58:44.037 --> 00:58:45.098]  It's that realization.
[00:58:46.215 --> 00:59:00.649]  Understanding that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling in to C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own... whatever it is.
[00:59:01.289 --> 00:59:06.354]  Just take action today and realize that we're going to win only
[00:59:07.475 --> 00:59:08.276]  If you take action.
[00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.817]  And again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[00:59:09.897 --> 00:59:10.498]  I love you.
[00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:12.420]  I appreciate you.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.462]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[00:59:15.142 --> 00:59:16.243]  I feel like you are me.
[00:59:16.404 --> 00:59:17.925]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[00:59:18.486 --> 00:59:24.251]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:29.456]  What we're covering is the blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[00:59:29.836 --> 00:59:31.758]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[00:59:32.219 --> 00:59:32.659]  So again, what
[00:59:32.859 --> 00:59:35.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:16.987 --> 01:00:18.511]  You need to breathe.
[01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:30.526]  So, Communist China has bought up Hollywood, it's bought up the treasuries.
[01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:31.707]  We're going to get into this next segment.
[01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:40.778]  This is a short little segment, so I want to finish up with Stephen W. Mosier's experiences in China as one of the first Americans, if not the first, to be allowed into the communes.
[01:00:41.419 --> 01:00:43.000]  It's just so riveting and so interesting.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.783]  I've been reading his work for decades.
[01:00:44.803 --> 01:00:45.664]  He's been on, I think,
[01:00:46.204 --> 01:00:47.865]  Ten years ago, and then a few years ago again.
[01:00:47.885 --> 01:00:49.306]  We should get him on routinely.
[01:00:49.586 --> 01:00:51.707]  Pop.org is the website.
[01:00:51.727 --> 01:00:53.748]  And we're not just here gloom and dooming.
[01:00:53.768 --> 01:00:55.349]  We're not bashing the Chinese.
[01:00:55.369 --> 01:01:00.732]  You know, CNN before has said, Trump hates Chinese people.
[01:01:00.753 --> 01:01:01.593]  He hates Asians.
[01:01:02.153 --> 01:01:05.035]  Or I've seen articles, Alex Jones hates Chinese.
[01:01:05.455 --> 01:01:07.156]  No, Chinese people hate communism.
[01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:08.977]  And it's super unpopular.
[01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:10.658]  My sister's Korean adopted.
[01:01:10.698 --> 01:01:14.941]  We don't... David Knight went and got... He already has his own biological children.
[01:01:16.027 --> 01:01:19.811]  See, they went as Christians and adopted their daughter as a baby, starving to death.
[01:01:20.371 --> 01:01:22.413]  She now lives here in the U.S., almost 20 years old.
[01:01:22.493 --> 01:01:23.995]  Great lady from China.
[01:01:24.035 --> 01:01:26.097]  No, we don't hate Chinese people.
[01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:30.821]  We're trying to stop them being aborted and being brainwashed and being turned into weapons against us.
[01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:32.223]  We want to see China free.
[01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.044]  We want humanity unified.
[01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:38.987]  And only real Christianity can do that, which they're executing Christians and blowing up their churches.
[01:01:39.027 --> 01:01:44.489]  But in the four minutes to break, just recapping what you witnessed in China and your message to leftists.
[01:01:44.929 --> 01:01:50.811]  So I've noticed the Mao Youth Brigades that run Antifa, that threaten us and do all sorts of things to other people.
[01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:57.034]  Their operating system is the Confucian centers at the major universities that they now admit are Chinese government run.
[01:01:57.474 --> 01:01:58.814]  We've infiltrated some of the meetings.
[01:01:58.994 --> 01:01:59.775]  They know we've done that.
[01:02:00.615 --> 01:02:12.988]  And they actually have UT chairs that are praising Mao and Communists at these meetings, and the operating system is Maoist for the grassroots globalist movement, not just here, but in Europe, I've noticed.
[01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:15.446]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:21.290]  The Confucian Institutes are a Trojan horse with Chinese characteristics that they're planting all over the world.
[01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.691]  It's not just the United States.
[01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:30.036]  The United States is the favorite target because obviously we're the principal obstacle to China's domination of the world.
[01:02:30.076 --> 01:02:35.980]  If they could get rid of us, they think they can deal with these other what they call the little countries quite easily.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.801]  You know, and that's their view of the world.
[01:02:38.841 --> 01:02:45.304]  Their view of the world is that China is at the center, and if you're not a friend of China, you're an enemy of China.
[01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:47.105]  China doesn't have neighbors.
[01:02:47.645 --> 01:02:49.406]  It doesn't have neighborly relations.
[01:02:49.506 --> 01:02:56.529]  It either has the tributary states, vassal states, or it has enemies, and only those two categories apply.
[01:02:56.929 --> 01:03:02.092]  But if they can deal with us, they believe that Australia and New Zealand and Canada
[01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:09.561]  Great Britain, all the rest will fall like dominoes because China is so much bigger and in their imagination so much more powerful.
[01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:17.311]  And you, I'm not trying to talk you up to folks here, but I remember reading your stuff 20 years ago.
[01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:18.352]  You were warning of all this.
[01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:23.898]  Back when we saw it all happening, and that Clinton is transferring the missile secrets and all the rest of it.
[01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:26.380]  But back then you were kind of a lonely voice.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.581]  You're not too lonely now.
[01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:33.985]  I mean, it looks like Trump and Pence and everybody in the military, and I've had high-level CIA reach out to us and they said, you're dead on.
[01:03:34.425 --> 01:03:37.447]  We're actually helping get the government back from globalists with this China thing.
[01:03:37.768 --> 01:03:39.749]  It's unifying Americans to make a decision.
[01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:46.694]  And the fact that now they realize that there are a lot of Americans aligned with the CHICOMS, that's actually causing a big wake-up.
[01:03:47.972 --> 01:03:51.674]  Yeah, the Chinese Communist Party has learned how to play the American system.
[01:03:52.114 --> 01:03:53.795]  They've learned how to take hostages.
[01:03:53.835 --> 01:03:56.336]  They're taking Canadian hostages right now in China.
[01:03:56.877 --> 01:04:00.498]  They've learned how to hold hostage American companies that want to do business in China.
[01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:07.362]  They've learned how to use Fortune 500 companies lobbyists in Washington to lobby for the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:04:07.682 --> 01:04:09.143]  So they've gotten very clever in doing this.
[01:04:09.243 --> 01:04:11.424]  You know, 20 years ago, Alex, they were they accrued
[01:04:11.884 --> 01:04:16.367]  And they blundered into giving money directly to Clinton's campaign.
[01:04:16.407 --> 01:04:20.209]  They were caught... Oh, at the White House with suitcases of cash?
[01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.629]  Absolutely.
[01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:24.951]  That was crude, and they were caught doing it.
[01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:28.453]  So now they're much more clever in their approach.
[01:04:29.013 --> 01:04:36.137]  These Confucius Institutes, of course, are intended to train the next generation of China watchers to be what?
[01:04:36.377 --> 01:04:37.578]  To be panda huggers.
[01:04:37.858 --> 01:04:41.140]  To be people who haven't learned real Chinese history,
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:51.148]  The brutal history of the Chinese Communist Party, the killing of 100 million Chinese, the starving death of 45 million Chinese, the elimination of 400 million Chinese... Well, stay there then.
[01:04:51.168 --> 01:04:52.709]  You're going to have the floor for the next two segments.
[01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:55.951]  Give us the 35,000 view, then the zero-foot view.
[01:04:56.352 --> 01:05:00.715]  We come back about what we're really facing with the Chai Koms, what their endgame is, and how we stop them.
[01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:20.452]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.
[01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:26.114]  After searching for the incredible ingredients to meet those needs, we're proud to bring you Ultimate Female Force.

[01:06:06.265 --> 01:06:14.212]  And it's all over for this unknown soldier
[01:06:34.455 --> 01:06:46.672]  They talk about the silent majority, but what about the unknown soldiers of liberty out there?
[01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:47.653]  All of you that support us.
[01:06:49.059 --> 01:06:50.840]  Pray for us, we wouldn't be here without you.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:07:00.764]  Stephen W. Mosier is our guest, one of the first Americans ever into Communist China as a Stanford Research Fellow in his best-selling book, Bully of Asia.
[01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:04.166]  Stephen W. Mosier, highly respected, syndicated columnist.
[01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:11.349]  You can read his latest article that's been one of the top stories last week, How Arrest of Chinese Princess Exposes Regime's World Domination Plot.
[01:07:12.327 --> 01:07:16.451]  And you see Google and Apple, about 10 months ago, moved to China.
[01:07:16.891 --> 01:07:21.735]  Trump lowers taxes from 40% to 15% on corporations to match China.
[01:07:21.775 --> 01:07:24.097]  That's a tariff they had, having a lower tax.
[01:07:24.658 --> 01:07:25.478]  It was a reverse tariff.
[01:07:25.779 --> 01:07:26.699]  They go to zero.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.343]  But they throw down the gauntlet and say, even Reuters had their statement.
[01:07:31.564 --> 01:07:32.785]  You must become state-run.
[01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:33.705]  And so Tim Cook said,
[01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.418]  You can have all the code keys to everybody in the world.
[01:07:36.998 --> 01:07:38.179]  This is beyond treason.
[01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:39.119]  This is madness.
[01:07:39.219 --> 01:07:41.820]  Google is helping them with AI, but not the Pentagon.
[01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:49.464]  So it's a big wake-up call to all the old rich guys in both parties playing games that China raced way ahead of us.
[01:07:49.984 --> 01:07:53.726]  And you're not just getting cheap, you know, goods that break before they come out of the package anymore.
[01:07:54.426 --> 01:08:11.017]  The CHICOMs you built up to be your economic takeover leverage have turned around and bitten you in the butt, which was always planned by the Council on Foreign Relations and David Rockefeller, who shed in the 70s when people like Mosier were allowed in because he was on the game plan then.
[01:08:12.509 --> 01:08:14.370]  To set China up to dominate the world.
[01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:19.352]  So, give us the Chi-Com view of the world and what we're currently facing with 5G.
[01:08:19.873 --> 01:08:23.114]  What, uh, because they've been taking our people hostages.
[01:08:23.134 --> 01:08:26.436]  They've been radiating our embassies, killing people.
[01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:27.736]  China's at war with us.
[01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:28.837]  They've been shooting at our ships.
[01:08:29.197 --> 01:08:32.139]  They're damn lucky this woman didn't just get indicted.
[01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:35.920]  I mean, you know, I'm seriously, we're in a war and I think it's Trump sending a little message.
[01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.101]  We're not going to just target your regular soldiers here.
[01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:39.782]  We're going to target your little princess.
[01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:40.903]  So break it down for us.
[01:08:42.011 --> 01:08:45.473]  Well, let's be clear about what China, how China views the world.
[01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:57.619]  Back in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Deng Xiaoping, who was then the supreme leader in China, called his senior Communist Party buddies together, and he said, the old Cold War is over.
[01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:00.560]  The United States has defeated the Soviet Union.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:08.284]  He said the new Cold War is now beginning between China and the United States, and China will win this one.
[01:09:09.241 --> 01:09:14.305]  I wrote a book back 20 years ago called Hegemon, China's Plan to Dominate Asia and the World.
[01:09:14.325 --> 01:09:15.125]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:09:15.566 --> 01:09:19.629]  A lot of people said, oh, China doesn't want to dominate Asia, doesn't want to dominate the world.
[01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:22.511]  It simply wants to join the existing world order.
[01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:26.013]  It wants to cooperate with us in building a more prosperous world.
[01:09:26.393 --> 01:09:31.177]  Well, now, 20 years later, everybody sees that wasn't the plan of China at all.
[01:09:31.577 --> 01:09:35.661]  The plan of China was beginning and end one of domination.
[01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:40.286]  China, the word China in Chinese, Zhongguo, means middle kingdom.
[01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:42.768]  It's a kingdom at the center of the earth.
[01:09:42.848 --> 01:09:49.114]  And the Chinese Communist Party wants China to be the kingdom at the center of the earth again.
[01:09:49.615 --> 01:09:55.621]  It has, the Communist Party has a disdain for the lesser peoples around China's periphery.
[01:09:56.221 --> 01:09:58.846]  Think about the Belt and Road Initiative.
[01:09:58.886 --> 01:10:00.449]  What is the Belt and Road Initiative?
[01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:06.720]  China is spending trillions of dollars building infrastructure in places like Pakistan.
[01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:17.546]  And, and Sri Lanka and India and Djibouti, they're built their first army base, naval base in Africa, in Djibouti, Africa.
[01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:21.488]  They're building infrastructure all around the world.
[01:10:21.928 --> 01:10:27.670]  And that infrastructure is intended to bring the world's economy into China's domain.
[01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:33.253]  It's intended to recenter the world's economy around China, so that China becomes
[01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:37.935]  The place where all goods are manufactured and the rest of the world becomes what?
[01:10:38.255 --> 01:10:43.477]  It becomes a source of raw materials for China and it becomes a source of agricultural products.
[01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:46.117]  But China becomes the factory floor of the world.
[01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:47.278]  That's the goal.
[01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:49.919]  The goal of the Made in China 2025 plan.
[01:10:49.939 --> 01:10:51.900]  By 2025, China wants to dominate robotics and
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.601]  Artificial intelligence.
[01:10:58.082 --> 01:10:59.443]  And now we get to Huawei.
[01:10:59.684 --> 01:11:10.516]  They want to dominate 5G because they know that if they dominate the high tech industries of the future, that is a path to dominating the world of the future.
[01:11:12.182 --> 01:11:21.488]  And is it not, you hinted at this when we went to break, without me even bringing it up, this, this, it's like a baby duck you can imprint on a wolf that's about to eat it.
[01:11:21.788 --> 01:11:22.989]  First thing it sees, it loves.
[01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.712]  The vitriol, I mean you always hear the left hates America.
[01:11:26.852 --> 01:11:28.213]  I don't call them liberals, they're the left.
[01:11:30.003 --> 01:11:50.198]  I'll go out to an event and I'll say, America's coming back, we're getting unemployment down, and we're coming together, and they go, oh, and I go, USA, USA, which you can make fun of the chant, it's like vampires seeing high noon, and they literally, you talk to them, America was never great, it'll never be great, China's great, everybody else is great.
[01:11:50.779 --> 01:11:55.763]  They literally have been taught to hate themselves and hate their heritage.
[01:11:56.892 --> 01:12:01.035]  And I don't even know why everybody wants to get in here, even though we're pretty much already done in many ways.
[01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:03.997]  What's left of the wreckage is so much better.
[01:12:04.517 --> 01:12:07.079]  They've never traveled to these countries.
[01:12:07.099 --> 01:12:10.101]  They've never experienced it, and you can't get through to them.
[01:12:10.801 --> 01:12:16.325]  It's like they have reflected glory from the collapse of America, and they love China's rise.
[01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:21.968]  It's like they're imagining Stockholm Syndrome, like loving your abuser, that they're with the Chai Koms.
[01:12:22.308 --> 01:12:24.430]  When they're the first people, the Chai Koms will get rid of.
[01:12:26.192 --> 01:12:27.112]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:29.814]  You know, and we can talk.
[01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:43.961]  We've probably talked for a long time about how the educational system in this country went 100 years ago from taking American children and teaching them that that America is the greatest experiment in ordered liberty the world has ever seen.
[01:12:44.871 --> 01:12:50.373]  I wrote a speech for President Ronald Reagan once, in which he talked about the city on the hill.
[01:12:50.433 --> 01:13:04.298]  He was a believer in the promise of America, not just for America, but that the lamp of liberty shining from America would lift other countries out of the darkness of tyranny and into the sunlit uplands of freedom and liberty.
[01:13:05.319 --> 01:13:07.259]  People in schools don't learn that anymore.
[01:13:07.499 --> 01:13:09.200]  All they learn, of course, is that we're
[01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:12.148]  Racist, sexist, all those other lies.
[01:13:12.368 --> 01:13:18.971]  You turn on the news, or any movie, it's all how you would demoralize people, and then you learn the Chi-Coms are funding most of it!
[01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:28.136]  I mean, it's just crazy that they found this many collaborators, and it seems to me, if we illustrate this to people, they're gonna come out of it, and like, come on!
[01:13:28.396 --> 01:13:32.578]  It's like, it should be so easy to beat this, is what I'm saying, but we don't have much time, do we?
[01:13:32.598 --> 01:13:35.079]  Because China is about to move into a dominant position.
[01:13:36.314 --> 01:13:44.179]  Well, I will tell you until the election two years ago, I think that that we were five years or maybe 10 years at the outside from a tipping point.
[01:13:44.499 --> 01:13:54.506]  And what I mean by that tipping point is that the world, the geostrategic table would tilt so far in the direction of China that we would never be able to reverse it.
[01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:57.568]  Now, of course, we have a chance, maybe our last chance.
[01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:01.226]  I totally agree.
[01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:13.892]  And so the average leftist, when all Trump has done is pragmatically try to help everybody, and like try to even parlay with this evil, I just cannot believe they're working against their own interests and don't get how incredible this last chance is.
[01:14:15.219 --> 01:14:30.648]  Yeah, when you read the Chinese press, as I do, you see that the Global Times and the People's Daily and the other Chinese newspapers in their criticism of Trump seem to repeat a lot of the things that the leftists in the United States say about our president.
[01:14:30.968 --> 01:14:33.930]  So it's almost as if there's this unholy alliance.
[01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:49.457]  Between American progressives and leftists on the one hand, and of course the Chinese Communist Party on the other, who really aren't, look, let's be clear, these aren't communists in the sense of to everybody according to their need and from everybody according to their ability.
[01:14:49.677 --> 01:14:50.618]  These are fascists.
[01:14:50.918 --> 01:14:57.161]  These are people who want to dominate, who love power above everything else, and who want to dominate not just the poor, downtrodden.
[01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:58.101]  Oh yeah, talk about that.
[01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.943]  How many inner party members are there and what's their average wealth?
[01:15:00.983 --> 01:15:03.284]  I mean, these are fabulously rich communists.
[01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:06.059]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.224]  This is the wealthiest Communist Party in the world.
[01:15:08.244 --> 01:15:10.810]  There are 90 million members of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:15:11.372 --> 01:15:13.517]  And if you want to get ahead in China,
[01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.043]  You have to join the Communist Party.
[01:15:16.404 --> 01:15:20.166]  And once you join the Communist Party, you're basically free to do anything you want.
[01:15:20.707 --> 01:15:26.991]  They have, for example, in Chinese cities, when the local city government runs a little short of cash, they will invent a new tax.
[01:15:27.391 --> 01:15:35.297]  And then the Communist Party members will go from door to door to businesses saying, you owe us another thousand dollars and just collect the money on the spot.
[01:15:35.377 --> 01:15:37.118]  Most much of it winds up in their pockets.
[01:15:37.438 --> 01:15:44.345]  The best example, though, is the former premier, a fellow named Wen, Premier Wen, Wen Jiabao is his full name.
[01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:48.689]  He came into office worth only a few million dollars.
[01:15:48.729 --> 01:15:53.534]  He left office, 10 years later, with 2.3 billion dollars.
[01:15:54.495 --> 01:15:56.256]  2.3 billion dollars in his pocket.
[01:15:56.296 --> 01:15:56.717]  Stay there.
[01:15:56.817 --> 01:16:01.862]  Let's talk about this little princess and how her arrest signals America's surrender is over.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:11.124]  I almost have to just sit back and take a moment of silence to think about how far we've come against the globalists.
[01:16:12.045 --> 01:16:13.906]  Ten years ago, you talk about a private Federal Reserve.
[01:16:13.926 --> 01:16:14.526]  People laughed at you.
[01:16:14.546 --> 01:16:15.487]  Now everybody knows it's private.
[01:16:16.508 --> 01:16:21.411]  Ten years ago, you talk about a private one-world government with a plan for global carbon tax and a plan to break up the family.
[01:16:21.471 --> 01:16:22.932]  People told you you were crazy.
[01:16:24.253 --> 01:16:29.697]  But as 2018 prepares to unleash its mortal coil and give birth to 2019,
[01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:32.782]  We've been proven right.
[01:16:33.562 --> 01:16:44.524]  That's why we're branded as fake news, that's why we're branded as Nazis, and all this made-up crazy crap by the horrible, deceptive corporate media that's sold out to all these multinational interests, like the Chi-Coms and others.
[01:16:45.044 --> 01:16:49.905]  So, I just want to make the statement again that humanity is awakening, thanks to God and all of your action.
[01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:56.626]  We are moving the ball down the field against the globalists, and now, more than ever, people have to realize that we're entering the event horizon.
[01:16:56.786 --> 01:17:00.667]  We've already passed the point of no return, and it's now up to you, InfoWars.
[01:17:01.267 --> 01:17:01.968]  Is in your hands.
[01:17:02.829 --> 01:17:06.532]  And InfoWars has been targeted because we are successful and we tell the truth.
[01:17:06.852 --> 01:17:08.734]  And they want to take us down to get at you.
[01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:12.197]  So just as I am in your hands, you are in our hands.
[01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:14.600]  We have a shared destiny.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.961]  And everyone knows it.
[01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:16.622]  They can feel it.
[01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:17.562]  They can smell it.
[01:17:18.322 --> 01:17:19.524]  And they're coming from everybody.
[01:17:20.145 --> 01:17:27.276]  Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, and myself, and Owen Schroer, and Matt Drudge, and everybody.
[01:17:27.296 --> 01:17:29.720]  They're trying to take everybody, Gavin McGinnis, off the air right now.
[01:17:30.401 --> 01:17:33.225]  But none of those guys were ever able to build their own platform except for Drudge.
[01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:40.464]  That's why you've got to support the InfoWars platform, because this model would mean the death to the globalist program of people being independent.
[01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:45.746]  InfoWars is the renaissance model, not the conquest model, and it's you that funds it and supports it.
[01:17:45.806 --> 01:17:49.648]  So, I'm spreading the word, praying for us, and financially supporting us, getting great products.
[01:17:49.968 --> 01:17:51.789]  InfoWarsStore.com, you make it all possible.
[01:17:52.129 --> 01:17:56.512]  And we have the best deals ever until the end of the year at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:56.752 --> 01:17:57.212]  Thank you all.
[01:18:04.775 --> 01:18:06.877]  We've done incredible things in our time.
[01:18:07.478 --> 01:18:09.099]  All of us in the Infowars community.
[01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:12.282]  And that's why we're the number one target by tyrants worldwide.
[01:18:13.163 --> 01:18:15.745]  And we could revel in our time, what we've already done.
[01:18:16.846 --> 01:18:20.209]  But the real battle for the future of civilization is just now heating up.
[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:24.493]  That's why the censorship and the demonization and the tyranny is out in the open.
[01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:26.816]  Because the controllers are scared.
[01:18:28.032 --> 01:18:34.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare to close out 2018, I cannot stress on you enough how I want to salute you.
[01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.342]  I cannot stress enough how much I want to thank you.
[01:18:37.943 --> 01:18:41.066]  I cannot stress enough how epic this battle is.
[01:18:41.607 --> 01:18:48.674]  The globalists literally want to capture all of civilization, all of the life process, not just of humans, but of plants and animals.
[01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.637]  They want to be God.
[01:18:50.717 --> 01:18:51.878]  They want to play God.
[01:18:52.199 --> 01:18:55.023]  They want to be omnipresent and surveil everything we do.
[01:18:55.323 --> 01:18:59.388]  They want us to take microchips and digital barcodes to buy and sell.
[01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:07.339]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[01:19:08.891 --> 01:19:29.723]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:35.267]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[01:19:36.192 --> 01:19:39.613]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and you tend to see it.
[01:19:39.853 --> 01:19:41.854]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:19:42.514 --> 01:19:45.215]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:19:45.975 --> 01:19:47.155]  2018 has been insane.
[01:19:47.175 --> 01:19:53.617]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:19:54.518 --> 01:19:58.179]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:19:58.199 --> 01:20:02.280]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[01:20:05.891 --> 01:20:08.533]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:32.473 --> 01:20:37.517]  So the globalists couldn't defeat the American system and it was too good an example.
[01:20:37.537 --> 01:20:42.160]  So they exported our jobs and technology to China and let it buy up our entertainment and everything.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:47.524]  So the globalists have a country to run to if they ever lose the war against America or they get indicted.
[01:20:48.686 --> 01:20:49.867]  And that's really where this is.
[01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:54.931]  So, Stephen W. Mosier, expert on China, lived there many years when it first opened up to the West.
[01:20:55.332 --> 01:21:01.937]  Bully of Asia, best-selling author, big article out, New York Post, How Arrest of Chinese Princess Exposes Regime's World Domination Plot.
[01:21:02.798 --> 01:21:04.359]  Don't politely pause or I'll jump in.
[01:21:04.379 --> 01:21:15.889]  In the eight minutes we have left of this segment, get into, you know, how we defeat this, what you think of Trump, what Americans can do, and what the stakes are here, because this is getting crazy.
[01:21:17.762 --> 01:21:19.364]  Well, the stakes, Alex, couldn't be higher.
[01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:23.908]  I mean, this is this is about the big bazooli.
[01:21:23.948 --> 01:21:25.469]  This is about the future of the world.
[01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:33.998]  This is about whether or not our children and grandchildren will be forced to learn Chinese and the collected sayings of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
[01:21:34.718 --> 01:21:53.211]  Because make no mistake, what's happening in China right now with minorities, with the Uyghurs for example, the Turkish minority in the West, where they're being rounded up and sent by a million of them into concentration camps, where they're forbidden to speak their own language, practice their own religion, practice their own culture, they're required to learn Chinese.
[01:21:53.631 --> 01:22:02.377]  That's the model that China would use on its neighbors like the Vietnamese, the Cambodians and the rest, once its influence expands.
[01:22:02.897 --> 01:22:05.678]  So this is this is for the this is for the ballgame.
[01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:27.783]  And the reason why the reason why the Huawei business is so important is Huawei, which means to serve China, is a Chinese company that has been promoted and subsidized by the Chinese Communist Party for the last few decades in order to dominate high tech, specifically the manufacture of smartphones on the one hand and the manufacture of 5G equipment.
[01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:28.484]  5G is the
[01:22:30.664 --> 01:22:38.171]  Of course, fiber to the phone, 100 times faster than 4G, it's going to control everything in the future.
[01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:49.200]  And if you install the 5G switching equipment, which the Chinese company Huawei wants to do around the world, then you can turn those switches on, and you can turn those switches off.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.161]  And I had to laugh the other day.
[01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:59.204]  The Italians were trying to convince the Italians of all people to rip out all of the Huawei equipment that they've installed in Italy.
[01:22:59.744 --> 01:23:02.545]  And the director of telecommunications in Italy said this.
[01:23:02.585 --> 01:23:06.327]  He said, but we like Huawei because it's so cheap and it's so flexible.
[01:23:06.667 --> 01:23:11.008]  Well, the reason it's cheap is it's subsidized by the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:23:11.269 --> 01:23:12.149]  Of course it's cheap.
[01:23:12.569 --> 01:23:13.889]  Because it's spy equipment.
[01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:18.590]  The reason it's flexible, Alex, is because it can be reprogrammed remotely.
[01:23:18.951 --> 01:23:20.351]  Well, isn't that convenient?
[01:23:20.631 --> 01:23:30.173]  The Chinese Communist Party, through Huawei, once it installs this 5G equipment, can reprogram it remotely to do exactly what Beijing wants.
[01:23:30.733 --> 01:23:32.494]  That's why this stuff is so dangerous.
[01:23:33.034 --> 01:23:34.974]  It's going to control everything in the future.
[01:23:35.374 --> 01:23:41.836]  The driverless cars, the freight trains, the power plants, and, of course, weapons systems.
[01:23:44.679 --> 01:23:47.681]  This is beyond something like the Terminator movie.
[01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:50.823]  This is the Communist Chinese dominant.
[01:23:51.124 --> 01:23:55.046]  Because, like you said, they'll sell it, not at cost, at a loss.
[01:23:55.787 --> 01:24:00.590]  As the heart of their global move, a Trojan horse, here's basically free 5G.
[01:24:00.991 --> 01:24:08.156]  Just pay for the basic cost, but we control it, and then the Chinese government is already dominant in rural America.
[01:24:08.196 --> 01:24:11.498]  They've already put it in and are already begging Trump, don't make us take it out.
[01:24:11.878 --> 01:24:13.479]  We want the QICOM 5G.
[01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:28.440]  Well, it's 30-40% cheaper than Cisco Systems or the other manufacturers of 5G equipment because it's paid for, in large part, by the Chinese Communist Party for their own purposes of control, spying, and espionage.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.722]  They've got literal slaves putting this crap together.
[01:24:30.742 --> 01:24:32.363]  Then they ship it over.
[01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:34.305]  Their technicians come over that are operatives.
[01:24:34.785 --> 01:24:36.947]  I can't believe we've even allowed this to happen.
[01:24:38.186 --> 01:24:40.147]  Well, we've gone pretty far down this road.
[01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:48.691]  Finally, we have an administration with people in the administration, like the Trade and Industry Council head, Peter Navarro, who understands.
[01:24:49.286 --> 01:24:51.967]  That China literally wants to kill us.
[01:24:52.007 --> 01:24:59.688]  Peter wrote a few years ago a book called Death by China, which people may have heard of, about how Chinese products can be dangerous to us.
[01:25:00.368 --> 01:25:03.649]  Bicycles that break down when you ride them and kill their owners.
[01:25:04.049 --> 01:25:04.749]  Things like that.
[01:25:04.989 --> 01:25:07.330]  But the 5G stuff is much more dangerous.
[01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:13.311]  It would be not just individual death by China, but it would be the death of our civilization.
[01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:16.532]  Because think about, all of a sudden the trains stop running,
[01:25:16.832 --> 01:25:17.853]  The car stopped running.
[01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:19.155]  The power plant shut down.
[01:25:19.455 --> 01:25:20.377]  The lights go off.
[01:25:20.717 --> 01:25:21.898]  Your cell phone doesn't work.
[01:25:22.299 --> 01:25:23.200]  Everything stops.
[01:25:23.881 --> 01:25:30.509]  And China says, in order for us to turn the lights back on again, you're going to have to demobilize.
[01:25:30.529 --> 01:25:32.191]  You're going to have to build down your military.
[01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:35.656]  You're going to have to hand us, you know, the Western Pacific.
[01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:38.017]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:25:38.057 --> 01:25:39.538]  We're talking about the endgame here.
[01:25:39.778 --> 01:25:54.104]  A century ago, you know, the important things were controlling strategic choke points, like the Panama Canal, like the Straits of Malacca, where the British built Singapore to control entry and egress from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean.
[01:25:54.404 --> 01:26:02.448]  Today, those strategic choke points are going to be controlled by 5G equipment, and we don't want that equipment to be made in China.
[01:26:02.848 --> 01:26:04.591]  Now, we've gotten pretty far down this road.
[01:26:04.971 --> 01:26:17.429]  We're having to go in, I understand, and rip out computer motherboards from many of our military facilities because we haven't paid enough attention to the fact that anything made in China
[01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:27.155]  Of a high tech nature is going to have a backdoor a trapdoor is going to have a chimp embedded in it so that the Chinese can use it remotely to collect information.
[01:26:27.335 --> 01:26:28.536]  That's not just me talking.
[01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:40.283]  I mean the FBI director Christopher Wray earlier this year said that Huawei equipment could be used in a malicious way to modify and steal information to conduct undetected espionage.
[01:26:41.203 --> 01:26:44.165]  That we wouldn't even find out about until months or years later.
[01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:47.147]  So we now know that this is a problem.
[01:26:47.387 --> 01:26:48.968]  We're now finally taking action.
[01:26:49.389 --> 01:26:51.210]  But we couldn't take action fast enough.
[01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:52.891]  And we've got to bring the world along with us.
[01:26:53.451 --> 01:26:56.033]  Because the United States can't stand alone in this.
[01:26:56.073 --> 01:26:59.615]  We have to have Australia, New Zealand, the English-speaking countries with us.
[01:26:59.675 --> 01:27:00.716]  I think they are on board.
[01:27:00.996 --> 01:27:04.679]  We have to get places like South Korea and Japan to join with us as well.
[01:27:04.999 --> 01:27:06.360]  Because if our allies are using 5G equipment,
[01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:13.615]  We really can't be allied with them in the future, because information flows both ways.
[01:27:13.635 --> 01:27:14.796]  Sure, everything's being intercepted.
[01:27:14.816 --> 01:27:21.401]  It's like when we have the Nazi Ultra Code, and of course they didn't know during World War II, that's how we were able to beat them.
[01:27:21.801 --> 01:27:23.982]  This is crazy, and it's all admitted.
[01:27:24.903 --> 01:27:31.548]  When the Chinese people want freedom, China's very weak if we simply stand up to them, and that's why
[01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:37.606]  I'm encouraging leftists and others out there who have this moronic hatred of America.
[01:27:38.306 --> 01:27:40.728]  China doesn't care about you.
[01:27:42.028 --> 01:27:50.834]  America is full of good people on average, and we need to stand against the robber barons, the big corporate elite that have bet on China.
[01:27:51.234 --> 01:27:57.137]  They're the real traitors that set China up to do this in their lust to defeat the American experiment.
[01:27:58.604 --> 01:28:01.445]  I know in my gut, we're going to beat the globalists and the shycoms.
[01:28:02.225 --> 01:28:05.006]  And I'm not a vindictive person, but justice needs to be done.
[01:28:05.066 --> 01:28:14.168]  And those of you that actively serve this, there's a lot of you out there, I know, listening, who are globalists, who serve the shycom operation, you're going to have to pay for what you've done.
[01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:16.609]  So I'm just encouraging everybody now, stop now.
[01:28:17.309 --> 01:28:24.211]  Don't be part of this and realize the alarm's already been pulled, the alarm's already been set, and the resistance has already been triggered.
[01:28:24.791 --> 01:28:26.972]  And I don't think in the end the globalists are going to win.
[01:28:26.992 --> 01:28:27.712]  What do you think, Steven?
[01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.312]  I think we still control our own destiny here.
[01:28:31.753 --> 01:28:36.658]  And certainly the Trump tariffs have done exactly what they were supposed to do.
[01:28:37.318 --> 01:28:40.221]  They have raised the cost for the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:28:40.562 --> 01:28:43.685]  They have brought the Chinese Communist Party to the negotiating table.
[01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:47.809]  And I think we're going to see the trade deficit with China shrink rapidly over the next
[01:28:48.309 --> 01:28:48.990]  A couple years.
[01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:52.775]  If not, the tariffs are going to go up to 25% and I'll tell you what that means.
[01:28:53.055 --> 01:28:57.500]  That means that Apple, which now makes things in China, will be making things in Vietnam.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:57.901]  Amazing.
[01:28:57.921 --> 01:28:59.843]  Stephen W. Mosier, Bully of Asia author.
[01:28:59.863 --> 01:29:00.644]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:29:00.684 --> 01:29:01.185]  We salute you.
[01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:22.981]  I don't know where these markets are going to go, but if the globalists have their way, they're going to go straight down, along with your job, and along with your pay increase, and along with everything you hold dear, because these globalists want to economically capture you and bankrupt you and control you.
[01:29:24.523 --> 01:29:33.431]  But if you use the free energy of word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, creativity, if you tell folks about InfoWars.com,
[01:29:34.924 --> 01:29:39.627]  Or NewsWars.com, or that local radio station that picks us up, or that local TV station that picks us up.
[01:29:39.727 --> 01:29:57.779]  If you spread the word about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the amazing products on every front that make your life better, that make your children's life better, that make your family's life better, then you're stepping out of their control and using your economic and cultural power to smash them.
[01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:04.704]  So I would encourage everyone, Christmas ordering is over, but right through to the New Year, we have a store-wide clearance sale going.
[01:30:05.504 --> 01:30:21.993]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, a free t-shirt with every order, 50 to 75% off many of these items we lose money on, but I believe you're gonna experience how great our fluoride free super blue toothpaste is fortified with a little silver and iodine and other essential oils.
[01:30:22.213 --> 01:30:25.395]  I think you're gonna experience how amazing it is and you're gonna want to reorder it.
[01:30:25.715 --> 01:30:36.080]  I think you're going to experience how amazing our colloidal silver bullet is, or how great RainForce Plus our nootropic is, or how amazing our body's ultimate tumeric formula, 95% cucuminoid.
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:37.241]  No one else even has that.
[01:30:37.341 --> 01:30:39.382]  The anti-inflammation powers are biblical.
[01:30:39.522 --> 01:30:43.724]  I believe in you, and I believe that you want freedom, and you want justice, and you want a future.
[01:30:43.864 --> 01:30:47.525]  And you understand that by financing InfoWars, you can't lose.
[01:30:47.866 --> 01:30:54.529]  Because you get products that are great for you and your family, you get a great deal, and you fund and support an organization totally.
[01:30:55.209 --> 01:31:00.491]  And completely, absolutely turned over to the fight against the globalists.
[01:31:01.191 --> 01:31:01.571]  Committed.
[01:31:02.031 --> 01:31:02.852]  Beyond commitment.
[01:31:03.492 --> 01:31:07.753]  Until my very individuality has been absorbed in the fight.
[01:31:08.134 --> 01:31:09.174]  And that's a damn good feeling.
[01:31:10.034 --> 01:31:11.815]  Because I'm the ultimate individualist.
[01:31:12.595 --> 01:31:13.616]  I'm the ultimate collectivist.
[01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:16.697]  The individual is powerful and is strong.
[01:31:17.117 --> 01:31:28.362]  When the individual chooses God and justice and joins the collective, it's a collective of individuals forming the true collective, not the false collective of the devil, Lucifer, whatever you want to call it that is slavery.
[01:31:28.642 --> 01:31:33.825]  Not a top-down collective, but a collective of common sense and the people that is transcendent.
[01:31:34.825 --> 01:31:39.706]  And it's in that true collective that humanity will reach the stars and go beyond.
[01:31:40.386 --> 01:31:50.889]  So as Christmas passes us, and 2018 goes into legend, into history, it's your chance to financially support the very tip of the spear of the fight against the globalists and get great products at the same time.
[01:31:51.429 --> 01:31:54.190]  A true 360 win, unless you don't take advantage of it.
[01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.970]  Please stay with us.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:08.304]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:32:08.604 --> 01:32:12.627]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:32:13.067 --> 01:32:15.269]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:32:15.309 --> 01:32:17.430]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:19.792]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:32:20.312 --> 01:32:20.552]  Boom!
[01:32:20.833 --> 01:32:23.094]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:32:23.434 --> 01:32:24.995]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:32:25.055 --> 01:32:26.877]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[01:32:26.937 --> 01:32:28.057]  You still have a shopfront.
[01:32:28.258 --> 01:32:29.038]  And then what do we see?
[01:32:29.318 --> 01:32:30.079]  Washington Post.
[01:32:30.619 --> 01:32:33.761]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[01:32:35.122 --> 01:32:38.244]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:32:38.264 --> 01:32:41.085]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:32:41.405 --> 01:32:46.809]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:54.113]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[01:32:54.453 --> 01:32:57.835]  We're not funded by dull state dictatorships like CNN is.
[01:32:58.095 --> 01:33:01.956]  We're only funded by you by getting the products in football store dot com.
[01:33:06.838 --> 01:33:09.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:37.899 --> 01:33:39.820]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:41.922]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:41.962 --> 01:33:42.382]  Central.
[01:33:42.582 --> 01:33:43.263]  We're here live.
[01:33:43.283 --> 01:33:44.944]  Don't forget the War Room at Owen Troyer.
[01:33:46.425 --> 01:33:48.486]  Weekdays, 3 o'clock Central.
[01:33:48.506 --> 01:33:49.427]  David Knight, doing a great job.
[01:33:49.447 --> 01:33:50.487]  David Knight Show, 8 a.m.
[01:33:50.648 --> 01:33:53.309]  every morning from the InfoWars News Center.
[01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:58.733]  The most lied about, the most demonized, the most attacked broadcast in the world because we're over the target.
[01:34:00.891 --> 01:34:06.815]  Well, somebody that has been saying that the economy was going to start going down because of too much debt and all the rest of it.
[01:34:06.835 --> 01:34:09.916]  It's Peter Schiff of Europac.com.
[01:34:10.497 --> 01:34:11.557]  He doesn't need an introduction.
[01:34:11.577 --> 01:34:21.383]  We're going to go to him in just a moment and get his take on this roller coaster stock market that already lost this year's gains and where he sees all of this going here in a moment.
[01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:24.265]  I'm not plugged yet today.
[01:34:25.725 --> 01:34:26.605]  But I'm going to now.
[01:34:27.425 --> 01:34:34.287]  Listeners have really supported the broadcast, and I appreciate that in the face of the Democratic Party, the establishment trying to shut us down.
[01:34:36.027 --> 01:34:40.568]  And so we're having year-end closeout sales that are the biggest sales we've ever had, been around the last month.
[01:34:41.428 --> 01:34:45.549]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, instead of 5%, 10% on your next order.
[01:34:46.349 --> 01:34:52.631]  Storewide free shipping, as I said, 50 to 75% off, and a free gift with every order.
[01:34:53.191 --> 01:34:54.671]  It was free t-shirt, but
[01:34:56.341 --> 01:35:00.504]  20,000 t shirts later, we're out of t shirts in large and extra large.
[01:35:01.044 --> 01:35:02.205]  So we have to stop that now.
[01:35:02.745 --> 01:35:05.747]  So you will get something of comparable value.
[01:35:06.288 --> 01:35:08.989]  A bottle of coal, silver, a bottle of brain force.
[01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:12.972]  I mean, there's a lot of cool free gifts that we're putting in each order.
[01:35:12.992 --> 01:35:17.055]  But regardless, you're funding in full war store dot com.
[01:35:17.835 --> 01:35:23.559]  You're funding an operation that, uh, yeah, we're saw a lot of this at cost to clear out the warehouse.
[01:35:24.741 --> 01:35:26.082]  You've seen the Soros group.
[01:35:26.162 --> 01:35:27.602]  You've seen Hillary, the Democrats.
[01:35:28.042 --> 01:35:29.963]  Shang, he's still got merchant accounts.
[01:35:31.424 --> 01:35:32.184]  Yeah, we had six.
[01:35:32.224 --> 01:35:33.144]  They got us down to one.
[01:35:33.384 --> 01:35:35.145]  We got a couple backups now in contracts.
[01:35:35.185 --> 01:35:37.446]  But this is a war to shut us down.
[01:35:37.546 --> 01:35:39.767]  So my model is this.
[01:35:40.707 --> 01:35:43.168]  About two months ago, I said, we're selling everything at cost or lower.
[01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:44.129]  Clear the warehouse out.
[01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:45.249]  Get operating funds in.
[01:35:45.269 --> 01:35:46.730]  And I'm going to move back to sponsorship.
[01:35:47.725 --> 01:35:48.145]  We're good to go.
[01:36:06.795 --> 01:36:08.176]  Support InfoWars today.
[01:36:08.296 --> 01:36:10.719]  We have very close to selling out a lot of products.
[01:36:10.739 --> 01:36:11.740]  We've sold out a lot of products.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.401]  Still some of our best sellers are there.
[01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:18.446]  Whether it's X2, X3, BrainForce, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:18.966 --> 01:36:22.249]  And a lot of these deals we lose money on, but we're not paying inventory tax.
[01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:27.314]  And it's a big, you know, you-know-what to the globalists that we're able to fund ourselves into the new year.
[01:36:27.334 --> 01:36:29.035]  And now they're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:34.224]  Uh, he's not supposed to talk about it or he'll lose his contract and get sued, but I can talk about it.
[01:36:34.264 --> 01:36:36.628]  And they're, they're taking, you know, everybody off the air.
[01:36:36.668 --> 01:36:37.289]  It's every day.
[01:36:37.329 --> 01:36:39.092]  It's some new top person taking off.
[01:36:39.373 --> 01:36:40.875]  Gavin McGinnis, the list goes on and on.
[01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:43.440]  Uh, all getting ready to try to take the president out.
[01:36:44.411 --> 01:36:45.931]  You can argue about his policies all day long.
[01:36:45.951 --> 01:36:48.312]  The point is, he's really pissed off the establishment.
[01:36:48.332 --> 01:36:51.593]  But, Peter Schipp of Europact.com manages billions.
[01:36:51.673 --> 01:36:54.714]  Of course, he was former chief advisor to Ron Paul.
[01:36:54.754 --> 01:36:57.914]  His dad's a famous patriot, or was a famous patriot, who I was friends with.
[01:36:58.755 --> 01:37:02.695]  But he joins us today to, you know, I guess toot his horn.
[01:37:03.196 --> 01:37:09.657]  He's made a lot of predictions, and he's been saying that this whole gravy train that we've seen the last two years is coming to an end.
[01:37:09.897 --> 01:37:12.078]  And, well, we're on the knife's edge.
[01:37:12.098 --> 01:37:12.578]  I think we've already
[01:37:13.098 --> 01:37:14.879]  Already kind of gone down the roller coaster, haven't we?
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.661]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:37:18.021 --> 01:37:18.562]  Happy New Year.
[01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:20.843]  You know, I'm watching history happen.
[01:37:21.744 --> 01:37:25.326]  Yeah, you know, I don't really want to toot my horn so much as sound the alarm.
[01:37:25.386 --> 01:37:28.428]  And guess what, you know, I've been saying this since Trump was inaugurated.
[01:37:28.828 --> 01:37:31.550]  But, you know, he inherited that big, fat, ugly bubble.
[01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:34.132]  And the problem was, he owns it now.
[01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:38.915]  Because, unfortunately, he called it a boom and claimed credit for it.
[01:37:39.035 --> 01:37:40.536]  But he's going to own the bust.
[01:37:40.936 --> 01:37:45.540]  Remember that what he inherited from Obama was a disaster.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.984]  I mean, that's why Trump was elected, because the recovery was phony.
[01:37:49.344 --> 01:37:54.729]  It was all engineered by cheap money and 0% interest rates and quantitative easing.
[01:37:55.089 --> 01:37:59.353]  That prevented the economy from going through a badly needed restructuring.
[01:37:59.733 --> 01:38:05.639]  It allowed the government to run enormous deficits under Obama without pushing interest rates up.
[01:38:06.119 --> 01:38:12.202]  And it pushed up the value of stocks and real estate so people could feel wealthier even though they weren't.
[01:38:12.682 --> 01:38:16.984]  And all of that, those assets, collateralized all sorts of debt.
[01:38:17.285 --> 01:38:21.947]  We borrowed a lot of money during that time because of these inflated real estate prices.
[01:38:22.407 --> 01:38:22.828]  We're good.
[01:38:44.489 --> 01:38:54.615]  And that means that the arrow is going to come out for the next two years, and we're going to be in a worse recession than the Great Recession when Trump is up for re-election.
[01:38:55.075 --> 01:38:56.456]  And that's going to be very difficult.
[01:38:56.476 --> 01:39:01.819]  You know, the last president to run for re-election during a recession was Jimmy Carter.
[01:39:02.179 --> 01:39:06.862]  And that didn't work out well for Carter, but it worked out well for the nation because we got Ronald Reagan
[01:39:07.302 --> 01:39:09.906]  Well, this time we're going to get the opposite of Ronald Reagan.
[01:39:09.926 --> 01:39:19.601]  We're going to end up with a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren type socialist as president in 2020 with the full support of a socialist Congress.
[01:39:19.641 --> 01:39:22.866]  So I think we have some dark days ahead, unfortunately.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.962]  Well, by the way, I wasn't being mean when I said toot your horn.
[01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:28.023]  I was tooting your horn for you that you were accurate.
[01:39:28.043 --> 01:39:29.265]  But listen, I know Trump's view.
[01:39:29.305 --> 01:39:30.425]  I've read his books about this.
[01:39:31.266 --> 01:39:39.033]  If we're in a global debt bubble acceleration and the big banks were giving the debt to themselves, you know, the free money themselves, Trump's like, we got to grow away out of this.
[01:39:39.053 --> 01:39:40.113]  We got to get some industry back.
[01:39:40.634 --> 01:39:42.175]  I'm damned if I have the bubble go.
[01:39:42.295 --> 01:39:43.176]  I'm damned if I don't.
[01:39:43.356 --> 01:39:43.977]  I should at least
[01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:46.771]  Trying to erect a bubble to the people.
[01:39:46.811 --> 01:39:48.632]  He basically said that.
[01:39:48.652 --> 01:39:52.334]  And then here comes the Federal Reserve with policy that you would agree with.
[01:39:52.814 --> 01:39:54.555]  Back when Obama was there, they should have raised rates.
[01:39:54.796 --> 01:39:55.436]  But they didn't.
[01:39:55.476 --> 01:39:59.138]  So then he raises it, clearly politically, on Trump.
[01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:01.579]  And then that signals the bubble imploding.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.341]  I mean, if we're going to have the bubble implode, I mean, I think that's Trump's argument.
[01:40:05.401 --> 01:40:07.903]  Why not let it expand some more?
[01:40:07.943 --> 01:40:12.605]  So what about the argument that clearly the Federal Reserve has been targeting Trump politically?
[01:40:12.665 --> 01:40:13.386]  Or you disagree with that?
[01:40:14.249 --> 01:40:22.094]  Well, look, I don't think the President has a lot of fans at the Federal Reserve, but I don't know that those guys are smart enough to know how to target him.
[01:40:22.414 --> 01:40:29.379]  But, you know, I actually think that had the Fed not raised rates, it would be worse right now, because the only reason the dollar hasn't imploded
[01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:31.740]  So you're predicting that we're about to do 2008 repeat again?
[01:40:56.331 --> 01:41:00.178]  Well it's not going to be an exact repeat because in 2008 the dollar went up.
[01:41:00.719 --> 01:41:02.943]  This time I think it's going to be a dollar crisis.
[01:41:03.083 --> 01:41:04.445]  Oh yeah, you did predict that too.
[01:41:04.465 --> 01:41:05.307]  The dollar's been going down.
[01:41:05.347 --> 01:41:06.849]  You were on like six months ago and said that.
[01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:09.453]  And the dollar hasn't really gone anywhere.
[01:41:09.653 --> 01:41:17.899]  It's been going sideways because people still believe that the economy is much stronger than it is and that the Fed is going to be able to deliver more rate hikes.
[01:41:18.199 --> 01:41:21.182]  But you know, we haven't had economic growth really under Trump.
[01:41:21.462 --> 01:41:23.364]  We've just spent more borrowed money.
[01:41:23.684 --> 01:41:28.708]  You know, Trump likes to talk about how we're having a resurgence in manufacturing, but we're not.
[01:41:28.988 --> 01:41:30.890]  The manufacturing numbers are terrible.
[01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:34.472]  The trade deficits under Trump are bigger than they've ever been.
[01:41:34.753 --> 01:41:36.234]  We have a record trade deficit.
[01:41:36.434 --> 01:41:37.774]  He's been trying to do something.
[01:41:37.814 --> 01:41:43.636]  Well, let's get to that next segment, but let me ask you this, Peter Schiff, of Europe Pacific, Capital Europe, PAC.com.
[01:41:44.356 --> 01:41:46.437]  The nightmare scenario, though, we'll go to break, talk about it.
[01:41:47.037 --> 01:41:53.759]  I agree with you that if Hillary wouldn't have stolen it from Bernie, even though I hate Bernie and his policies, he would probably have beaten Trump.
[01:41:53.959 --> 01:41:55.099]  America's going that way.
[01:41:55.399 --> 01:41:56.699]  Look at Cortez as a bellwether.
[01:41:56.759 --> 01:41:59.100]  That woman is an idiot, and she won in the last slide.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:05.512]  So I agree with you that if we don't do something right now, we're going to end up basically communist in 2020.
[01:42:05.572 --> 01:42:09.240]  So start getting into that because I think that's scary.
[01:42:10.202 --> 01:42:14.384]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's communism, you know, socialism.
[01:42:14.664 --> 01:42:16.505]  Communism is a form of socialism.
[01:42:16.546 --> 01:42:20.308]  I don't know that it's going to get that dire, but yeah, I mean, that's where we're headed.
[01:42:20.348 --> 01:42:26.171]  I think Bernie getting elected, or Alexander Cortez, or Elizabeth Warren, I mean, they're basically communists.
[01:42:26.211 --> 01:42:29.973]  Like, Hugo Chavez called himself a socialist, and then once he got full power, he was a communist.
[01:42:30.939 --> 01:42:32.400]  Yeah, I mean, look, they're socialists.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.762]  I mean, communism, fascism, they're all forms of socialism.
[01:42:36.122 --> 01:42:40.904]  It's basically a belief that, you know, that the free market doesn't work and that the government should do everything.
[01:42:40.924 --> 01:42:45.367]  And clearly, that's where the heart of the Democratic Party is right now.
[01:42:45.427 --> 01:42:46.948]  And we're moving in that direction.
[01:42:47.308 --> 01:42:50.710]  And that's why I'm afraid that Trump is going to get blamed.
[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:54.552]  This crisis that's going to happen, Trump didn't cause it, right?
[01:42:54.812 --> 01:42:56.253]  No, you've been saying that.
[01:42:56.273 --> 01:42:56.993]  You've been dead on.
[01:42:57.353 --> 01:42:58.334]  And I wanted you to be wrong.
[01:42:58.714 --> 01:42:59.314]  You've been right.
[01:42:59.354 --> 01:43:00.015]  Let's just say it.
[01:43:00.635 --> 01:43:01.658]  Leadership's right so far.
[01:43:01.678 --> 01:43:06.313]  Google's world headquarters.
[01:43:06.333 --> 01:43:08.178]  They've now officially moved to China.
[01:43:09.537 --> 01:43:11.719]  Is on fire right now, if you're a radio listener.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.681]  And so we've got the headline here of the Daily Mail.
[01:43:13.741 --> 01:43:18.126]  Gigantic fire erupts from the roof of Google office in China's Silicon Valley.
[01:43:18.266 --> 01:43:24.312]  A massive fire erupted in a Google office in China, sending dangerous black plumes of smoke rising in the air.
[01:43:24.352 --> 01:43:26.354]  The furious blaze was first reported at 11 a.m.
[01:43:26.414 --> 01:43:32.380]  local time on Wednesday in Zhonggangkan Tech District, also known as China's Silicon Valley in Beijing.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.322]  Google is an AI super weapon.
[01:43:35.542 --> 01:43:38.085]  It is a system that gets the whole world to opt into it.
[01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:40.346]  So they can then game stock markets, economies.
[01:43:40.627 --> 01:43:44.590]  It can then predict what you're going to do with almost total certainty before you do it.
[01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:47.592]  And there's a race between Facebook and Amazon.
[01:43:48.553 --> 01:43:58.119]  And Apple with Google, even though they're all very incestuous and work in and out of each other, to build the first global AI system that they believe will then take over all the markets and take over society.
[01:43:58.139 --> 01:43:59.460]  It's basically already happened.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.002]  Google is the top of the pyramid, right there with Apple.
[01:44:02.262 --> 01:44:04.183]  All things are Google, aren't they?
[01:44:04.303 --> 01:44:15.671]  The global DARPA-controlled and DARPA-designed advanced research project into a human-mass-machine interface to be able to predict the future and then control the future.
[01:44:16.151 --> 01:44:33.041]  That's in the founding documents of Google 1997-1998 and it was in Wired Magazine four years ago they actually released the quote classified Google documents admitting that when they were getting CIA funding and NSA funding they're saying we already have search engines.
[01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:34.021]  This is NSA technology.
[01:44:34.041 --> 01:44:34.441]  They said no.
[01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:42.286]  We're going to get humans to interface with it with their hopes, their dreams, all their actions, dial it into all the other machines and computers and have a lifetime model of the world
[01:44:42.466 --> 01:44:44.788]  We're already deep into the AI war of the 21st century.
[01:44:45.008 --> 01:44:47.409]  These things are already artificially intelligent.
[01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:51.993]  The question is when will they become, if not already, conscious, self-aware, sentient.
[01:44:52.173 --> 01:44:53.474]  So let me tell you what's coming next.
[01:45:05.322 --> 01:45:07.483]  Google has 90 plus percent of all the searches.
[01:45:07.743 --> 01:45:09.965]  They've got over half the advertising on the planet now.
[01:45:10.145 --> 01:45:14.027]  They are getting into every faction and system of supply chain.
[01:45:14.127 --> 01:45:20.470]  They have bragged in internal memos that they can deliver elections to whoever the political structure wants them to.
[01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:22.391]  Why wouldn't you steal their passcode?
[01:45:22.431 --> 01:45:23.772]  Why wouldn't you move to Communist China?
[01:45:23.992 --> 01:45:29.515]  Why wouldn't you help build a censorship system for the Communist Party they've been using for years that's about to go nationwide?
[01:45:29.995 --> 01:45:32.716]  And why not tell Congress, I don't know anything about Dragonfly.
[01:45:32.736 --> 01:45:34.037]  We have lots of projects.
[01:45:34.097 --> 01:45:35.638]  We don't intend to go live with that.
[01:45:35.678 --> 01:45:37.378]  Meanwhile, their internal emails have been released.
[01:45:37.398 --> 01:45:39.439]  They're like, find out whoever did this in FM!
[01:45:39.459 --> 01:45:41.480]  This is our most secret project!
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.602]  Listed top secret beta testing for the rest of the world!
[01:45:44.822 --> 01:45:48.103]  We're competing with Apple for the global social ID.
[01:45:48.824 --> 01:45:51.585]  And Google is not going to let Apple get the global social ID.
[01:45:51.865 --> 01:45:53.506]  We are going to rule the planet!
[01:45:54.406 --> 01:45:56.747]  Our AI system is superior!
[01:46:06.428 --> 01:46:10.370]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:46:12.091 --> 01:46:15.092]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:46:15.212 --> 01:46:17.233]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:46:17.894 --> 01:46:21.716]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:46:22.196 --> 01:46:29.520]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.101]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:46:35.521 --> 01:46:37.722]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:46:37.742 --> 01:46:40.922]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:46:41.162 --> 01:46:51.925]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:46:53.845 --> 01:46:57.206]  I've never missed your show, any day.
[01:46:57.446 --> 01:46:58.387]  I mean, what?
[01:46:58.487 --> 01:47:00.127]  I mean, never!
[01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.961]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:34.496]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:35.477 --> 01:47:39.381]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:39.822 --> 01:47:43.625]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:44.006 --> 01:47:45.667]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:46.688 --> 01:47:47.169]  Alright!
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:55.588]  Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com, billions under management, you know I'm all over CNBC, you name it, has made a lot of accurate predictions.
[01:47:55.648 --> 01:47:59.192]  And he's been talking about the debt and what's happening in the dollar and all the rest of it.
[01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:03.838]  And so, continuing then, what do you expect to see next?
[01:48:04.258 --> 01:48:06.100]  What do you think Trump should do versus
[01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:07.721]  What's been happening?
[01:48:07.741 --> 01:48:14.023]  And you're elaborating on Trump getting the blame for the process that was already going on.
[01:48:14.043 --> 01:48:18.685]  I mean, I know the Federal Reserve at first kind of suckered him in and said, maybe things are going to grow.
[01:48:18.705 --> 01:48:19.565]  Then they said they weren't.
[01:48:20.166 --> 01:48:22.046]  And then they said it would never grow past three percent.
[01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:22.686]  It did.
[01:48:23.086 --> 01:48:24.647]  That kind of made people get more exuberant.
[01:48:24.687 --> 01:48:27.228]  What's what's really going on and what's coming next?
[01:48:27.981 --> 01:48:30.504]  Yeah, you know, first of all, I got a few things in common with you.
[01:48:30.524 --> 01:48:32.706]  You know, CNBC banned me about two years ago.
[01:48:33.246 --> 01:48:34.908]  So I haven't been on there in a long time.
[01:48:34.988 --> 01:48:36.790]  So I have a hard time getting on the mainstream.
[01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:37.631]  What got you banned?
[01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:38.852]  You used to be all over the place.
[01:48:39.553 --> 01:48:40.293]  I have no idea.
[01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:43.777]  You know, the last time I was supposed to be on was a couple of years ago.
[01:48:43.837 --> 01:48:47.460]  I was scheduled to be on with Rick Santelli, who used to invite me on quite a bit.
[01:48:48.101 --> 01:48:49.903]  And then I got canceled last minute.
[01:48:50.752 --> 01:48:52.153]  And I haven't been invited on since.
[01:48:52.733 --> 01:48:57.816]  And Rick had no idea why I got canceled, but that was my last scheduled appearance.
[01:48:58.356 --> 01:49:02.579]  I do, I get on Fox Business every once in a while, but I mean, I'm not on CNN anymore.
[01:49:02.939 --> 01:49:03.880]  I'm not on Bloomberg.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.480]  They banned me.
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:10.123]  They were the first to probably ban me eight, nine years ago after I was on almost every week before the financial crisis.
[01:49:10.163 --> 01:49:13.285]  So they don't like, you know, my opinion getting out there.
[01:49:13.305 --> 01:49:17.167]  But let me just get back to, you know, what we're talking about with Trump.
[01:49:17.467 --> 01:49:18.808]  You know, because Trump
[01:49:19.463 --> 01:49:19.903]  Thank you.
[01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:40.112]  I mean, this is going to be easier than it was blaming Bush for the 2008 crisis.
[01:49:40.412 --> 01:49:44.435]  That's what made it so easy for Obama to beat John McCain.
[01:49:44.735 --> 01:49:59.165]  Well, it's going to be even easier for whoever the Democrats nominate to beat Trump when we are in a massive recession and they're going to blame it on tax cuts, on deregulation, on everything that Trump did is going to get blamed.
[01:49:59.545 --> 01:50:02.567]  What Trump should have done when he was first elected
[01:50:03.067 --> 01:50:13.634]  Instead of trying to be popular and trying to make it easy, he should have basically delivered the bad news and basically said, look, you know, we've had eight years of a phony economy.
[01:50:13.674 --> 01:50:15.976]  In fact, it began long before Obama.
[01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:18.097]  We have to deflate this bubble.
[01:50:18.437 --> 01:50:23.020]  We're going to have to go through a protracted recession to get our economic house in order.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.902]  If we want to make America great again, here's what we need to do.
[01:50:26.222 --> 01:50:27.403]  We need to shrink government.
[01:50:27.443 --> 01:50:28.884]  We need to cut government spending.
[01:50:29.244 --> 01:50:30.746]  We need to rein in entitlements.
[01:50:30.866 --> 01:50:34.189]  We need to cut regulations so we can produce and save.
[01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:35.571]  We need higher interest rates.
[01:50:35.851 --> 01:50:37.393]  The stock market's going to come down.
[01:50:37.433 --> 01:50:39.014]  The real estate market's going to come down.
[01:50:39.355 --> 01:50:45.181]  But if we want to produce again and export and do all these things that we did when we were great, this is what we need to do.
[01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:47.363]  We need to swallow this bitter-tasting medicine.
[01:50:47.703 --> 01:50:48.924]  Let's stop right there though.
[01:51:13.442 --> 01:51:15.864]  I mean, the bubble wasn't getting to the people before.
[01:51:15.964 --> 01:51:17.165]  They couldn't get above 3%.
[01:51:17.606 --> 01:51:23.671]  Trump and the exuberance of getting some industry back and, you know, America first did get a lot of people excited.
[01:51:24.092 --> 01:51:29.377]  And so it did inflate the bubble bigger, way bigger than they thought, which I think kind of scared the Federal Reserve.
[01:51:29.437 --> 01:51:31.018]  I mean, I mean, let's give him some credit.
[01:51:31.058 --> 01:51:32.940]  He sure the hell pumped that bubble up.
[01:51:34.062 --> 01:51:37.386]  I don't want to give somebody credit for pumping a bubble.
[01:51:37.506 --> 01:51:40.028]  I want credit for letting the bubble deflate.
[01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:41.190]  Bubbles are a problem.
[01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:42.831]  They distort the economy.
[01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:49.278]  They can feel good just like drugs, but I don't want to encourage somebody to become a heroin addict because it feels good.
[01:51:49.659 --> 01:51:51.441]  I'm sure you were offered this too.
[01:51:51.501 --> 01:51:52.382]  Let me be conservative.
[01:51:53.357 --> 01:52:00.720]  I could have made the last six, seven years $300 million, literally, going with all the Bitcoin people and everything else.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.820]  I know what people got paid.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:14.586]  I had them offering me a million a month, real companies, just two years ago, and I never endorsed it because I thought at the end of the day it was going to be like the Tulip, you know, fiasco in the Netherlands a couple hundred years ago.
[01:52:14.886 --> 01:52:16.246]  I'm not saying crypto isn't real.
[01:52:16.286 --> 01:52:17.887]  I'm not saying digital currencies aren't okay.
[01:52:18.467 --> 01:52:19.387]  I said it was bad news.
[01:52:19.407 --> 01:52:20.508]  I think marijuana stocks
[01:52:20.968 --> 01:52:25.197]  Long-term or a total bubble, because everybody and their dogs are involved in it.
[01:52:25.257 --> 01:52:28.143]  And some people say, oh, I get offered all this money to promote marijuana stocks.
[01:52:28.203 --> 01:52:28.765]  I'm not doing it.
[01:52:29.246 --> 01:52:30.769]  So I mean, I get what you're saying.
[01:52:30.809 --> 01:52:31.731]  I don't like bubbles either.
[01:52:32.555 --> 01:52:33.175]  I'm just saying.
[01:52:52.986 --> 01:53:00.573]  But, you know, yeah, I applaud the fact that you resisted the temptation to subject your audience to a Ponzi scheme.
[01:53:00.613 --> 01:53:07.699]  I'm sure a lot of people in the crypto universe wanted to get you pumping all those coins so they can dump them on your audience.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:12.063]  And it's good for you that you didn't fall for that, because a lot of people are going to be left behind.
[01:53:12.083 --> 01:53:12.523]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:53:12.543 --> 01:53:13.684]  Years ago, we're not going to say any names.
[01:53:13.905 --> 01:53:15.246]  I wasn't sophisticated like you were.
[01:53:15.786 --> 01:53:19.389]  Eight, nine years ago, he called me and said, hey, you're not just promoting somebody's newsletter.
[01:53:19.469 --> 01:53:20.450]  It's a whole stock deal.
[01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:23.192]  So I had to learn, like, oh, I'm not just promoting a newsletter.
[01:53:23.493 --> 01:53:29.858]  So when it got to Bitcoin, I'm like, and I was kind of when it hit like the biggest thing in the world, bigger than JP Morgan, bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[01:53:30.258 --> 01:53:31.619]  And I'm like, was I wrong?
[01:53:31.659 --> 01:53:34.782]  But then it just went last December straight down.
[01:53:34.802 --> 01:53:38.205]  And I can sit back and tell my audience now, I did not tell you to do it, did I?
[01:53:38.785 --> 01:53:43.209]  But sometimes I go, man, could have sure funded the company with 300 million bucks, but I'd probably go to prison.
[01:53:44.355 --> 01:53:46.095]  Yeah, and you know, we're not finished going down.
[01:53:46.136 --> 01:53:48.216]  I mean, people made money if they got in early.
[01:53:48.596 --> 01:53:53.097]  But of course, those gains are going to equal the losses by all the people who got in late.
[01:53:53.377 --> 01:53:56.518]  And by the time they were trying to pump, pay you to pump it, it was late.
[01:53:56.758 --> 01:54:01.100]  They weren't trying to get you to pump Bitcoin when it was a dollar, or five dollars, or ten dollars.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.500]  No, they were begging me to do it starting two years ago, and then into its peak.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.521]  It was like, just take it, it's a million.
[01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:07.881]  Just come on, it's a great deal.
[01:54:07.901 --> 01:54:09.682]  I had like movie stars calling me and stuff.
[01:54:10.495 --> 01:54:15.960]  Yeah, look, they always end badly, but Bitcoin is just a microcosm for the whole United States.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:18.902]  Our whole economy is a gigantic bubble.
[01:54:19.143 --> 01:54:24.067]  And, you know, had Hillary Clinton won, I don't think the Fed ever would have raised rates again.
[01:54:24.387 --> 01:54:27.570]  They raised rates only one time before Trump was elected.
[01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:28.971]  Sure, so that's my question.
[01:54:28.991 --> 01:54:30.773]  So they clearly did something different because it was Trump.
[01:54:31.761 --> 01:54:38.165]  No, because Trump enabled them to get in a few more hikes by blowing more air into the bubble.
[01:54:38.245 --> 01:54:40.426]  And you talk about the 3% GDP growth.
[01:54:40.726 --> 01:54:42.667]  We only got that for a couple of quarters.
[01:54:42.827 --> 01:54:46.149]  I'm not even sure if we're going to be at 3% for all of 2018.
[01:54:46.269 --> 01:54:48.851]  We didn't get it for 2017.
[01:54:49.731 --> 01:54:54.054]  But whatever the GDP ends up being this year, this is going to be the high watermark.
[01:54:54.074 --> 01:54:54.734]  We're going down.
[01:54:54.774 --> 01:54:58.056]  We're probably going to be in a recession in GDP next year.
[01:54:58.156 --> 01:54:59.157]  And we're not going to get out of it.
[01:54:59.177 --> 01:54:59.877]  That's my next question.
[01:55:00.057 --> 01:55:03.281]  A lot of economists are saying 20% reduction, bare minimum.
[01:55:03.321 --> 01:55:08.007]  Some are saying 50%, and they're predicting great mainstream news.
[01:55:08.608 --> 01:55:10.370]  I'm not saying that's right, because they lie so much.
[01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:12.092]  A Great Depression scenario.
[01:55:13.055 --> 01:55:16.959]  Well, the Great Depression is going to happen after the Democrats get in in 2020.
[01:55:17.019 --> 01:55:21.103]  I mean, you know, because I guess the good news is they're going to screwed up even more.
[01:55:21.363 --> 01:55:25.587]  I mean, if you want to call that good news, because we might have a shot of taking back the country in 2024.
[01:55:26.088 --> 01:55:34.456]  But, you know, Hoover, you know, was in office when the Depression started, but it really didn't become a depression.
[01:55:34.916 --> 01:55:36.257]  So you're predicting stagflation in 2021?
[01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:04.983]  Except not just stagnation, an actual recession.
[01:56:05.283 --> 01:56:10.507]  I'm talking about big inflation and recession at the same time, not just slow growth.
[01:56:10.527 --> 01:56:11.488]  Has that ever happened before?
[01:56:12.697 --> 01:56:13.597]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[01:56:13.637 --> 01:56:17.479]  In the 1970s, I don't think the economy was actually contracting.
[01:56:17.519 --> 01:56:19.340]  I think it was still going up.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.482]  But, you know, a lot of it has to do with the way they calculate inflation.
[01:56:23.522 --> 01:56:29.265]  So it's probably happened, but the government hasn't officially acknowledged it because of the way they score it.
[01:56:29.485 --> 01:56:34.708]  But I think that this time, even the government numbers are going to show a contracting economy.
[01:56:34.728 --> 01:56:35.468]  So let me ask you this then.
[01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.049]  What are you investing in?
[01:56:37.984 --> 01:56:40.427]  Well look, I haven't changed my strategy.
[01:56:40.487 --> 01:56:41.768]  I've been investing the same way.
[01:56:42.209 --> 01:56:45.192]  To me, it's amazing that this bubble has gone on this big.
[01:56:45.232 --> 01:56:55.103]  And again, had Trump not been elected, it would have popped two years ago, and I think the dollar would already be falling, gold would already be taking off, because the Fed would already be back in zero.
[01:56:55.384 --> 01:56:57.226]  They'd already be doing quantitative easing.
[01:56:57.486 --> 01:57:01.229]  So I think people should be getting out of the dollar before the bottom drops out.
[01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:03.291]  Getting out of overpriced U.S.
[01:57:03.331 --> 01:57:04.252]  stocks and bonds.
[01:57:04.612 --> 01:57:08.335]  Getting into better valued assets outside the United States.
[01:57:08.375 --> 01:57:12.259]  There are better valued... Sure, I mean does gold only go up or other commodities go up?
[01:57:12.898 --> 01:57:15.139]  Well, I think all the commodities are ultimately going to go up.
[01:57:15.179 --> 01:57:19.081]  I think gold's going to go up the most, so I think you're going to see a deflation in that.
[01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:30.766]  I think commodity prices will fall in terms of real money, which is gold and silver, but I think prices are going to rise in terms of, you know, all these paper substitutes, like dollars or even euros.
[01:57:30.806 --> 01:57:32.367]  I know you've got to go, but it's a two-minute break.
[01:57:32.387 --> 01:57:37.469]  If you'll do five more minutes, I want to get back into Bitcoin, because I'm not a rocket scientist like you managing billions of dollars.
[01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:39.611]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist.
[01:57:39.631 --> 01:57:40.652]  Just have that common sense.
[01:57:40.692 --> 01:57:41.152]  No, I know.
[01:57:41.212 --> 01:57:43.755]  So I want to hear about Bitcoin, because I agree with you.
[01:57:43.795 --> 01:57:44.556]  Not just Bitcoin.
[01:57:44.576 --> 01:57:45.777]  And people are really pissed when I do this.
[01:57:45.817 --> 01:57:46.498]  I get death threats.
[01:57:46.638 --> 01:57:47.719]  I think it's going to go to zero.
[01:57:47.739 --> 01:57:51.523]  I mean, I just... Let's come back in two minutes and talk about that.
[01:57:53.365 --> 01:57:56.989]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[01:57:57.890 --> 01:58:03.195]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:03.796 --> 01:58:05.357]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[01:58:06.238 --> 01:58:11.924]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:22.276]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[01:58:23.057 --> 01:58:23.578]  It's that simple.
[01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:25.160]  So, it's epic.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:25.841]  It's amazing.
[01:58:26.101 --> 01:58:27.583]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[01:58:28.163 --> 01:58:30.606]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[01:58:32.188 --> 01:58:37.252]  This is the stuff of legends, and I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[01:58:37.872 --> 01:58:40.194]  You are not just part of the info war.
[01:58:40.754 --> 01:58:41.395]  You're the core.
[01:58:41.435 --> 01:58:41.995]  You're the heart.
[01:58:42.095 --> 01:58:42.736]  You're everything.
[01:58:43.536 --> 01:58:56.686]  And it's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own...
[01:58:59.494 --> 01:59:07.796]  Whatever it is, just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[01:59:07.856 --> 01:59:09.316]  Again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[01:59:09.396 --> 01:59:10.017]  I love you.
[01:59:11.117 --> 01:59:11.917]  I appreciate you.
[01:59:11.957 --> 01:59:13.977]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[01:59:13.997 --> 01:59:15.778]  I feel like you are me.
[01:59:15.938 --> 01:59:17.458]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[01:59:17.998 --> 01:59:23.759]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.180]  What we're covering is
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:28.963]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[01:59:29.343 --> 01:59:31.345]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[01:59:31.725 --> 01:59:42.035]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and InfoWars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[01:59:42.355 --> 01:59:42.676]  Do it.
[01:59:43.336 --> 01:59:44.918]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[01:59:44.938 --> 01:59:49.722]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win, we're going to build an incredible world together.
[01:59:49.942 --> 01:59:51.324]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[01:59:55.191 --> 02:00:01.095]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.773 --> 02:00:36.394]  All right, Peter Schiff of Europac.com is our guest.
[02:00:37.095 --> 02:00:42.957]  Looking at all the cryptocurrencies, what happened, who's really behind it, clearly big companies were involved.
[02:00:43.637 --> 02:00:44.898]  It was a pump, it was a dump.
[02:00:45.678 --> 02:00:53.561]  And yeah, they really, I got offered a lot of money over the years, $100,000, you know, a month's advertising, a million advertising, all these different big top groups calling me.
[02:00:53.961 --> 02:00:58.183]  And I could tell, I even told my wife this last year, I said, I'm getting offered.
[02:00:58.703 --> 02:01:07.072]  By five or six companies a day now, millions of dollars a month to advertise this, I go, I think they're just trying to, like, shut me up when it goes down that my name's on it.
[02:01:07.533 --> 02:01:10.716]  So I'm glad I didn't, but you've been an early critic of all this.
[02:01:11.918 --> 02:01:16.583]  What's the post-mortem on the cryptocurrency so far, and will they go to zero?
[02:01:17.432 --> 02:01:27.104]  Well, you know, I think initially when it first got started, there was a lot of well-intentioned people in there that, you know, didn't like the central banks and fiat currencies and were looking for an alternative.
[02:01:27.184 --> 02:01:31.630]  And, you know, I just don't believe that these cryptocurrencies ultimately can be money.
[02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:35.114]  They just don't have the qualities that you need to be money.
[02:01:35.194 --> 02:01:36.196]  But what happened as
[02:01:36.696 --> 02:01:39.337]  A bubble started in these things and the prices went up.
[02:01:39.617 --> 02:01:42.419]  That's when all that money came in to try to profit from it.
[02:01:42.439 --> 02:01:46.480]  And that's when you had all the pump and dumpers and all the scams and the hysteria.
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:55.584]  You know, I had clients, I had to talk clients calling me up when Bitcoin was $15,000, wanting to put their entire IRA because they thought it's going to a million.
[02:01:55.824 --> 02:01:57.305]  You know, I had to talk a lot of people
[02:01:57.905 --> 02:02:08.514]  Out of that, I mean, nobody was calling me up when Bitcoin was $10 or $100, but when it was $10, $15,000, I mean, people kept calling, and there was a lot of hysteria, but it was all a bunch of nonsense.
[02:02:08.874 --> 02:02:12.957]  And yeah, all these currencies, there's 2,000 or so different cryptocurrencies.
[02:02:13.538 --> 02:02:18.602]  None of them have any real value, but as long as people think they're going up, because they think there's a greater fool.
[02:02:18.662 --> 02:02:23.406]  In fact, they don't even know it's a greater fool, because they just think that this is, you know, this revolution.
[02:02:23.726 --> 02:02:35.199]  And I talk to these guys, there's a lot of them here in Puerto Rico where I live that have come down here, and some of these guys are still passionate about it, and I hear them talk about it, and they don't even realize they're saying a bunch of nonsense.
[02:02:35.279 --> 02:02:36.200]  Nothing makes sense.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.343]  But they think I'm just some old fool who doesn't get it.
[02:02:39.563 --> 02:02:42.326]  They're so trapped in their own bubble, they can't see it.
[02:02:42.406 --> 02:02:44.629]  And it's ironic, because nobody can see their own bubble.
[02:02:44.889 --> 02:02:52.254]  The people who are in Bitcoin, oh, they can see the bubble in the dollar or the stock market or the real estate market, but they don't see the bubble in Bitcoin.
[02:02:52.294 --> 02:03:00.119]  Just like a lot of people on Wall Street, Jamie Dimon, you know, he can say, oh, there's a bubble in Bitcoin, but he doesn't see there's a bubble in the stock market or the U.S.
[02:03:00.199 --> 02:03:00.619]  economy.
[02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:02.441]  So it's all in the eye of the beholder.
[02:03:03.321 --> 02:03:09.824]  Reuters and others reported, you know, back last year, 950 billion Bitcoin, just Bitcoin, is bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[02:03:10.564 --> 02:03:14.426]  Obviously there were people extracting everybody else's wealth in the Ponzi scheme.
[02:03:14.786 --> 02:03:17.267]  What's the inside baseball and who made all that money?
[02:03:17.448 --> 02:03:20.609]  I know I wouldn't take it because, I mean, I'm not a criminal.
[02:03:20.769 --> 02:03:23.190]  I might as well just rob banks if I'm going to act like that.
[02:03:23.230 --> 02:03:24.951]  You didn't either, which makes me respect you.
[02:03:25.911 --> 02:03:27.172]  What in the hell?
[02:03:27.612 --> 02:03:29.353]  Who needs to get in trouble here?
[02:03:30.151 --> 02:03:33.172]  Well, remember, a lot of the money is still just on paper, right?
[02:03:33.212 --> 02:03:34.693]  Because it doesn't really exist.
[02:03:34.813 --> 02:03:35.954]  It's just a price.
[02:03:36.014 --> 02:03:37.834]  You know, it's not real until you cash out.
[02:03:38.155 --> 02:03:42.997]  The people who made money were the people who cashed out, who got in early and cashed out.
[02:03:43.017 --> 02:03:45.778]  But the problem is... And is that what brought it down, is that people cashed out?
[02:03:46.755 --> 02:03:47.716]  Well, they started to.
[02:03:47.896 --> 02:03:48.916]  They haven't even finished.
[02:03:48.996 --> 02:03:52.258]  Look, it's still at, you know, $3,600, $3,800, wherever it is.
[02:03:52.338 --> 02:03:53.499]  It's got a ways to go down.
[02:03:53.539 --> 02:03:54.680]  This is still a high price.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:58.542]  But then you had all these companies that got started, all this malinvestment.
[02:03:58.842 --> 02:04:02.485]  People are anticipating institutional demand and all this stuff happening.
[02:04:02.505 --> 02:04:03.685]  This is all malinvestment.
[02:04:03.966 --> 02:04:05.226]  It's all going to be liquidated.
[02:04:05.286 --> 02:04:08.448]  But again, this is a microcosm of the broader economy.
[02:04:08.729 --> 02:04:13.471]  This is just one of the bubbles that has been created by central bankers.
[02:04:13.872 --> 02:04:15.773]  But you have to have a real safe haven.
[02:04:16.113 --> 02:04:21.477]  I think a lot of people who got distracted, they should have been buying gold, and they got caught up in cryptocurrencies.
[02:04:21.517 --> 02:04:26.420]  They should come back to gold while they can, and get into some real safe haven investments.
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:37.408]  That's what I'm trying to do with my clients at Europe Pacific Capital through my asset management company that I run here in Puerto Rico, is really prepare people for the collapse, not only of the fiat currency, but the fiat crypto currency.
[02:04:37.488 --> 02:04:38.169]  All right, well, let's do this thing.
[02:04:38.189 --> 02:04:39.350]  You said you could stay a little bit longer.
[02:04:39.370 --> 02:04:40.370]  Do a few more minutes.
[02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:41.291]  This is a one-minute break.
[02:04:41.871 --> 02:04:43.292]  What will the collapse look like?
[02:04:44.605 --> 02:04:46.606]  Again, going back to this cryptocurrencies for a moment.
[02:04:48.186 --> 02:04:51.347]  How do we get people that are in it out of the brainwashing?
[02:04:51.387 --> 02:04:54.388]  Because it's like a Nigerian phone scam or email scam.
[02:04:54.828 --> 02:04:55.789]  I've had this happen to family.
[02:04:55.989 --> 02:04:59.930]  Once they've been scammed, they don't want to admit they've been scammed and then they stay in the scam.
[02:05:03.416 --> 02:05:08.718]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:05:09.799 --> 02:05:18.223]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:05:19.463 --> 02:05:27.467]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:28.456 --> 02:05:35.523]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:05:36.303 --> 02:05:38.646]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:05:39.386 --> 02:05:40.247]  It really is amazing.
[02:05:40.868 --> 02:05:47.034]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:05:47.494 --> 02:05:50.096]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:52.121]  Of InfoWars.
[02:05:52.963 --> 02:05:54.005]  So please spread the links.
[02:05:54.245 --> 02:05:57.271]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[02:05:57.572 --> 02:06:00.257]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:06:00.858 --> 02:06:01.940]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:03.262]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:06:14.727 --> 02:06:22.234]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:06:22.714 --> 02:06:36.826]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:06:37.267 --> 02:06:40.710]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space.
[02:06:41.070 --> 02:06:45.173]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:06:45.413 --> 02:06:49.396]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[02:06:50.196 --> 02:07:06.328]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[02:07:06.528 --> 02:07:07.248]  InfoWars.
[02:07:07.629 --> 02:07:08.509]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:07:08.809 --> 02:07:09.150]  Today.
[02:07:12.463 --> 02:07:18.008]  All right, I don't want to say he's right, but he's been right before the crash 10 years ago and right now.
[02:07:18.028 --> 02:07:21.651]  And obviously, I know it's a bubble, but he was trying to get industry back.
[02:07:22.192 --> 02:07:24.334]  The CHICOMs get their bubble, everybody else gets their bubble.
[02:07:24.354 --> 02:07:30.259]  And then the Federal Reserve raises rates, clearly trying to target the recovery, which I get is overall a false recovery.
[02:07:30.299 --> 02:07:36.645]  But if it gets Americans to believe in America again, to get some industry back, to secure the border and have sovereignty,
[02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:47.676]  Then, I was trying to get behind the President, and I'm behind him on going after China and their infiltration, and going after the open border, and all the rest of it.
[02:07:47.716 --> 02:08:00.524]  But then you look at the whole situation with the cryptocurrencies, and how people got sucked into that, just like they get sucked into socialism, or communism, or Bernie-ism, or Alexander Cortez-ism.
[02:08:00.984 --> 02:08:03.186]  And I agree exactly with what he's saying.
[02:08:03.246 --> 02:08:04.687]  He's been saying it for a while, but it's clear.
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:10.001]  He was saying this a couple years ago, and I'm like, oh yeah, America's not that dumb to go socialist or communist.
[02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:19.544]  And now, when the left goes super hard left, man, people, bing bing bing bing bing, they want to hear that everything's free and everything's going to be great.
[02:08:20.124 --> 02:08:26.445]  So I kind of like Trump's bubble version of that, because at least it's pro-America, you see, instead of the Venezuelan model.
[02:08:26.505 --> 02:08:28.846]  So, and I'm being honest with the listeners.
[02:08:29.426 --> 02:08:34.949]  You know, I'm like stuck in a mineshaft and there's two tunnels out and both are collapsing, but this one looks a little better.
[02:08:34.969 --> 02:08:37.090]  I'm going to try to crawl up through that.
[02:08:37.190 --> 02:08:40.372]  So I'll dispense with the metaphors here.
[02:08:41.712 --> 02:08:44.494]  The owner and manager of EuroPAC.com, Peter Schiff, Billions Under Management.
[02:08:45.154 --> 02:08:52.498]  What in your brain can Trump do now to change course if you think he's wrong, just for hypothetical discussion, and navigate
[02:08:53.178 --> 02:08:57.119]  Well, first of all, you know, false confidence is a very dangerous thing, whether it's confidence in the economy or confidence in cryptocurrencies.
[02:08:57.239 --> 02:08:59.400]  It causes you to do things that you shouldn't do.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:02.361]  And you can get excited that, yes, the president got a lot of people to be optimistic early on,
[02:09:19.867 --> 02:09:28.951]  But all these people are going to be disappointed when their optimism turns out to be unwarranted, and they're going to take out their frustrations on Trump and other Republicans.
[02:09:28.991 --> 02:09:29.811]  That is the problem.
[02:09:29.851 --> 02:09:33.753]  Now, what could he do now to repair the damage?
[02:09:33.933 --> 02:09:35.313]  I don't know if it's repairable.
[02:09:35.333 --> 02:09:38.335]  I mean, he'd have to come out and basically say, I was wrong.
[02:09:38.635 --> 02:09:39.855]  The economy isn't great.
[02:09:39.895 --> 02:09:41.236]  I didn't make America great again.
[02:09:41.756 --> 02:09:44.898]  Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter,
[02:10:01.901 --> 02:10:04.644]  Literally, he didn't build the bubble, as you said.
[02:10:04.664 --> 02:10:06.805]  If he did that, everything would plunge.
[02:10:06.825 --> 02:10:07.906]  He would be removed.
[02:10:07.926 --> 02:10:09.047]  He would be impeached next week.
[02:10:09.087 --> 02:10:18.656]  No, he didn't build it, but he branded it with a big giant T. I mean, what he should have done is, if he would have bit the bullet day one and used his popularity,
[02:10:19.056 --> 02:10:21.197]  And hey, I am not a career politician.
[02:10:21.237 --> 02:10:21.997]  I'm a statesman.
[02:10:22.277 --> 02:10:25.478]  I'm not doing what's politically... I don't care about my own re-election.
[02:10:25.818 --> 02:10:29.680]  Let's just finally get this house in order and done it day one.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.881]  Yes, the stock market never would have gone up.
[02:10:31.921 --> 02:10:33.521]  We would have had a bear market right away.
[02:10:33.761 --> 02:10:35.322]  We would have gone right into recession.
[02:10:35.362 --> 02:10:41.484]  We would have dealt with our problems instead of kicking the can down the road for a couple more years while the problems got bigger.
[02:10:41.864 --> 02:10:43.045]  Now it's going to be too late.
[02:10:43.085 --> 02:10:46.666]  There's no way we're going to be on the upswing by the time he's up for re-election.
[02:10:46.846 --> 02:10:50.947]  Peter Schiff, here's the existential threat, and you're right in mathematics.
[02:10:51.568 --> 02:10:53.168]  You're absolutely correct, no one denies that.
[02:10:53.608 --> 02:10:54.449]  Who's got a brain?
[02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:57.530]  But food stamp money runs out in like a month.
[02:10:57.610 --> 02:11:08.473]  You've got half the public, lazy people, who absolutely have a heart on for Bernie Sanders, in a good way, and who are delusional.
[02:11:08.954 --> 02:11:12.555]  And so, we're stuck in this bubble, we're stuck in all this crap.
[02:11:13.487 --> 02:11:19.933]  Trump made it so much easier for Bernie Sanders or whoever he, you know, handpicks as his successor to win.
[02:11:19.993 --> 02:11:20.894]  That is the problem.
[02:11:21.215 --> 02:11:28.862]  Things are now going to get so bad and it's all going to be blamed on lower taxes on the rich and corporations and
[02:11:29.202 --> 02:11:29.522]  Sure.
[02:11:59.342 --> 02:12:09.249]  Government-guaranteed jobs, you know, $15 minimum wage, universal basic income... Which will really cause stuff to tank.
[02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:14.553]  Again, they are going to turn this recession into an inflationary depression.
[02:12:14.853 --> 02:12:17.635]  And we have one shot to take our country back, and that's 2024.
[02:12:18.856 --> 02:12:23.359]  Because if we don't turn away from socialism in 2024, we'll never turn away from it.
[02:12:23.459 --> 02:12:24.720]  I mean, it'll be here forever.
[02:12:25.181 --> 02:12:28.363]  Just like the New Deal programs, only this is a much worse deal.
[02:12:29.634 --> 02:12:32.276]  So let me ask you this question, Peter Schiff of Europe Pacific Capital.
[02:12:34.458 --> 02:12:43.905]  Pulling back from this, there's no education program to get to collectivists and they believe in what they're doing, but the controllers know this is about domesticating populations.
[02:12:44.605 --> 02:12:47.848]  Why would the establishment and the big mega banks and the power elite
[02:12:49.332 --> 02:12:52.716]  Build in a socialist system that ends up destroying productivity.
[02:12:52.756 --> 02:13:01.545]  I know it creates a consolidation of power, but why would you want to consolidate something that sucks instead of ride something that's really successful and beautiful?
[02:13:01.985 --> 02:13:11.595]  So I'm always trying to wake the public up, and we've got a great audience and they're amazing, but sometimes I just think what really angers them that we do is sometimes we're able to talk to Congress folks, the President,
[02:13:12.296 --> 02:13:16.840]  That's what worries the elite, is that we might actually try to influence the establishment.
[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:20.803]  Is there any way to get the establishment to put the brakes on collectivism?
[02:13:20.823 --> 02:13:23.065]  And why does the establishment keep pushing for it?
[02:13:24.279 --> 02:13:26.342]  Well, the establishment is changing.
[02:13:26.622 --> 02:13:29.065]  Who is actually in the establishment?
[02:13:29.125 --> 02:13:32.470]  If you look at the Democratic Party, it is shifting to the left.
[02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:35.874]  More and more people are buying into this nonsense.
[02:13:36.194 --> 02:13:39.599]  The establishment is going to look different in 2020 than it has looked in the past.
[02:13:39.639 --> 02:13:40.019]  It's going to be
[02:13:43.283 --> 02:13:48.084]  Much more, you know, socialist-minded, and this legislation is going to come in.
[02:13:48.104 --> 02:13:52.625]  Now, of course, there's always people who are going to be able to survive socialism.
[02:13:52.665 --> 02:14:00.587]  There's always a handful of wealthy people that are well-connected, that manage to preserve their wealth, but the vast majority of people are going to suffer.
[02:14:00.887 --> 02:14:04.228]  The people who are going to suffer the most are the people who think they're going to benefit the most.
[02:14:04.568 --> 02:14:10.449]  It's all the poor or the middle class that are buying into this nonsense that think government's going to make their lives better.
[02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:16.771]  Can you imagine if the Alexandra Cortez's got control of the US, they would have all our nuclear weapons, everything.
[02:14:16.811 --> 02:14:18.212]  This is a global crisis.
[02:14:18.652 --> 02:14:22.994]  It's a good thing she's not 35, otherwise she might be able to run for president and win.
[02:14:23.734 --> 02:14:25.135]  That's how ridiculous this is.
[02:14:25.875 --> 02:14:34.338]  But hopefully the Supreme Court can save us, because if we get a few good justices in there, everything that the Socialists are going to try to do is going to be unconscionable.
[02:14:34.358 --> 02:14:36.239]  And is that why they're so upset, obviously?
[02:14:36.259 --> 02:14:38.360]  Because they are so upset about the Supreme Court.
[02:14:39.987 --> 02:14:40.908]  Well, I guess.
[02:14:40.988 --> 02:14:44.150]  I hope we'll see if the Supreme Court can actually rise to the occasion.
[02:14:44.190 --> 02:14:48.853]  Because in the past, I think the judiciary has been a failure.
[02:14:48.893 --> 02:14:50.674]  I mean, because they've let the people down.
[02:14:50.714 --> 02:14:53.936]  They haven't forced the government to abide by the Constitution.
[02:14:53.976 --> 02:14:56.097]  Because almost everything the government does now is unconstitutional.
[02:14:56.117 --> 02:14:58.299]  Oh yeah, Kavanaugh's already been voting against Trump.
[02:14:58.719 --> 02:15:01.481]  And we've seen socialist decisions just the last week.
[02:15:02.121 --> 02:15:05.183]  Because it's just incredible what a bunch of swamp creatures they are.
[02:15:06.573 --> 02:15:13.895]  But, you know, they might be our last defense against a lot of this stuff that the Democrats are going to pass through Congress and that a socialist will sign.
[02:15:14.275 --> 02:15:19.457]  Maybe the Supreme Court will strike it down because all this stuff is not authorized by the Constitution.
[02:15:19.777 --> 02:15:20.277]  And so we'll see.
[02:15:20.297 --> 02:15:26.499]  You know, we finally had a decent justice, you know, in Texas, said Obamacare was unconstitutional, which it is.
[02:15:26.979 --> 02:15:29.720]  And so hopefully that that decision will survive.
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:30.220]  How long?
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:32.101]  We're almost out of time, but how long do you think
[02:15:32.501 --> 02:15:36.784]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg can hold on with methamphetamine and steroids she's reportedly on.
[02:15:36.844 --> 02:15:37.324]  I don't know.
[02:15:37.524 --> 02:15:38.005]  I don't know.
[02:15:38.025 --> 02:15:42.307]  They're trying to keep her alive, but she should resign at this point.
[02:15:42.347 --> 02:15:46.910]  She's obviously in ill health, but maybe she's trying to hang on until 2021.
[02:15:47.551 --> 02:15:48.471]  All right.
[02:15:48.551 --> 02:15:51.313]  Peter Schiff, Europac.com, another censored patriot.
[02:15:51.693 --> 02:15:52.554]  Amazing info.
[02:15:52.674 --> 02:15:52.974]  Wow.
[02:15:53.154 --> 02:15:54.055]  Talk to us again soon.
[02:15:54.415 --> 02:15:56.096]  We'll be back with a ton of breaking news.
[02:15:56.116 --> 02:15:57.657]  They caught the cop killer, the illegal alien.
[02:15:57.677 --> 02:16:00.159]  I'm sure Mets is pissing themselves right now.
[02:16:04.045 --> 02:16:08.727]  This past weekend, I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[02:16:08.747 --> 02:16:13.970]  And while I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald living section.
[02:16:15.411 --> 02:16:23.015]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe, but it's all packaged very, very slickly.
[02:16:23.875 --> 02:16:25.016]  Here's just one example.
[02:16:25.936 --> 02:16:34.205]  from the Sunday, December 23rd, 2018 Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[02:16:34.965 --> 02:16:41.252]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is and how to set up the flicker ray on your television, right?
[02:16:41.832 --> 02:16:42.413]  I'm not kidding.
[02:16:43.394 --> 02:16:48.839]  But beneath that, there's an article breaking the expectations of boys will be boys.
[02:16:50.043 --> 02:16:53.044]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[02:16:53.445 --> 02:16:55.826]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[02:16:57.327 --> 02:16:58.827]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[02:16:59.388 --> 02:17:01.609]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college.
[02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:02.829]  And boys are depressed.
[02:17:02.889 --> 02:17:04.910]  And boys can't get jobs.
[02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:07.571]  And you know what the problem is?
[02:17:07.812 --> 02:17:08.832]  Boys are boys.
[02:17:08.872 --> 02:17:13.234]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish and how to be in dance class.
[02:17:14.115 --> 02:17:14.375]  That's right.
[02:17:14.395 --> 02:17:16.356]  We need to teach them how to be like girls.
[02:17:18.084 --> 02:17:23.467]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[02:17:23.727 --> 02:17:28.790]  He worries that the people interviewing here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[02:17:30.519 --> 02:17:33.400]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:38.001]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[02:17:38.481 --> 02:17:42.762]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[02:17:42.802 --> 02:17:49.624]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[02:17:50.364 --> 02:17:56.266]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[02:17:58.581 --> 02:18:02.027]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[02:18:02.047 --> 02:18:06.794]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[02:18:08.246 --> 02:18:08.566]  I don't know.
[02:18:32.461 --> 02:18:34.524]  Make sure everybody stayed in line.
[02:18:34.864 --> 02:18:37.847]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[02:18:38.968 --> 02:18:42.612]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[02:18:43.193 --> 02:18:44.855]  The whole human species is under attack.
[02:18:46.198 --> 02:18:53.101]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[02:18:53.881 --> 02:19:02.404]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[02:19:04.286 --> 02:19:09.352]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[02:19:10.273 --> 02:19:19.565]  We're three or four generations into this, and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms.
[02:19:20.726 --> 02:19:23.728]  And help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[02:19:24.568 --> 02:19:25.689]  That's how we're going to save them.
[02:19:26.590 --> 02:19:38.097]  Just like LBJ Bragg, 45 years ago, that he'd have black people voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[02:19:39.093 --> 02:19:40.093]  And that's how they operate.
[02:19:40.754 --> 02:19:44.335]  The article is sickening, and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[02:19:44.896 --> 02:19:49.778]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[02:19:49.878 --> 02:19:53.119]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[02:19:53.439 --> 02:19:56.721]  They're the ones destroying your identity, while claiming they're protecting it.
[02:19:56.801 --> 02:20:01.103]  They're the ones telling you what to be, while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[02:20:06.247 --> 02:20:10.368]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.931 --> 02:20:30.433]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:20:37.836 --> 02:20:44.177]  All right.
[02:20:46.038 --> 02:20:48.578]  I can't even keep track of all the stacks of news I've got here.
[02:20:49.499 --> 02:20:54.840]  California illegal alien that killed another cop has been captured.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:21:01.962]  And, you know, Mexico and Latin America, the people are not wimps.
[02:21:03.553 --> 02:21:09.437]  I mean, most people are real nice and hard working, but there's a certain percentage that are loco.
[02:21:10.698 --> 02:21:11.959]  That's Spanish for crazy.
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:18.283]  And about half the time you see a squad car video, a cop just pulls somebody over and it's an illegal alien.
[02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:19.784]  They just get out and start shooting.
[02:21:21.805 --> 02:21:23.726]  So nobody's saying people are wimps down there.
[02:21:23.786 --> 02:21:27.889]  My God, 200,000 dead the last two years, a couple hundred thousand missing.
[02:21:29.010 --> 02:21:31.211]  Why, the drug cartels even kill little kids now.
[02:21:31.391 --> 02:21:32.172]  Didn't used to do that.
[02:21:37.210 --> 02:21:38.550]  But we never know these cops' names.
[02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:47.253]  You know, they'll show them for like a half day, but it's not like Trayvon Martin or something, where they just build it up and the Justice Department under the Democrats tries to hype it up.
[02:21:48.754 --> 02:21:54.576]  You know, San Francisco reports suspected cop killer arrested in Bakersfield, officials say.
[02:21:54.916 --> 02:22:01.878]  Hell, if it's a San Francisco jury, as long as it's an illegal alien and you shoot a white person, of course this guy wasn't white, you're not going to get in trouble.
[02:22:01.938 --> 02:22:04.299]  And again, I'm not into what color I am.
[02:22:04.379 --> 02:22:04.979]  The left is.
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.323]  I got a whole stack of news here, where they're letting Muslims rape women in Europe.
[02:22:10.804 --> 02:22:16.708]  And even feminists are now going, what is this thing about letting Muslim men do this to women?
[02:22:16.748 --> 02:22:17.989]  It's just sick!
[02:22:19.931 --> 02:22:21.312]  And again, here's the thing.
[02:22:22.473 --> 02:22:23.894]  I don't fetishize the police.
[02:22:25.775 --> 02:22:29.598]  There are some thugs and mental patients and control freaks that try to become police.
[02:22:31.059 --> 02:22:35.323]  And when you get authoritarian regimes, you get bad cops who are put in, and then you're really in trouble.
[02:22:36.701 --> 02:22:48.095]  The whole Hollywood establishment attack on the police of the last decade is to get them to go under globalist control, to be political police like they are in blue cities, to oppress the American people.
[02:22:48.356 --> 02:22:51.480]  It's an attempt to bully police and their unions into submission.
[02:22:53.069 --> 02:22:58.074]  And the fact that the police have bucked that, because I saw them going under globalist control last decade.
[02:22:58.154 --> 02:23:07.583]  I was like, well, the average cop's not your enemy, but they're being taught the Constitution's bad, veterans are bad, gun owners are bad, constitutionalists are bad, Alex Jones is violent.
[02:23:08.163 --> 02:23:11.106]  If you pull somebody over, they've got to get us out of the UN, stick or arrest them.
[02:23:11.767 --> 02:23:13.368]  I was saying, man, these cops are bad.
[02:23:14.049 --> 02:23:17.012]  Not the cops themselves, but what they're being taught is bad.
[02:23:18.587 --> 02:23:22.631]  And man, I noticed when I would criticize the police, they'd have me all over the news.
[02:23:22.691 --> 02:23:24.092]  I thought, oh, this is popular.
[02:23:25.553 --> 02:23:27.835]  No, I was playing into it.
[02:23:30.265 --> 02:23:48.899]  But if I showed a police officer getting killed saving a kid or a firefighter in some burning house, or I showed a cop changing somebody's tire that got run over by a drunk driver, tried to raise money for him, there wouldn't be any views on YouTube, and I'd suddenly get a strike or a suspension.
[02:23:50.481 --> 02:23:57.586]  Man, when I was cop bashing, the Google algorithm was Alex Jones on those videos.
[02:23:58.006 --> 02:23:59.748]  And I finally, about eight, nine years ago, I went,
[02:24:00.748 --> 02:24:02.569]  You know, something weird's going on here.
[02:24:04.890 --> 02:24:11.172]  Because I could fart in the wind and it'd get 10 million views if it was bashing police.
[02:24:11.192 --> 02:24:16.955]  And that's another one of my cardinal sins was figuring that out.
[02:24:18.455 --> 02:24:19.636]  And I'm still figuring stuff out at 45.
[02:24:19.716 --> 02:24:21.317]  Believe me.
[02:24:24.224 --> 02:24:26.445]  And that doesn't mean there aren't jerk police.
[02:24:26.665 --> 02:24:30.147]  It doesn't mean that the power of the state isn't out of control sometimes.
[02:24:30.167 --> 02:24:33.509]  It doesn't mean acid formature seizure targets the wrong people and it's wrong.
[02:24:34.449 --> 02:24:35.150]  I get it, man.
[02:24:38.231 --> 02:24:39.512]  But the cops aren't GMO.
[02:24:40.273 --> 02:24:41.173]  They're not the 5G.
[02:24:41.193 --> 02:24:42.134]  They're not the open border.
[02:24:42.454 --> 02:24:43.674]  They're not the Mexican Mafia.
[02:24:43.714 --> 02:24:44.715]  They're not the CHICOMS.
[02:24:45.235 --> 02:24:47.476]  They're not the problem statistically.
[02:24:49.117 --> 02:24:50.078]  The police kill
[02:24:51.732 --> 02:24:53.094]  A couple thousand people a year.
[02:24:53.615 --> 02:24:56.499]  And you could say a couple hundred might be illegitimate.
[02:24:56.599 --> 02:24:57.120]  Okay, great!
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:58.602]  Catch the cop being wrong?
[02:24:58.782 --> 02:24:59.183]  Fry him!
[02:24:59.243 --> 02:24:59.583]  Fry him!
[02:25:02.548 --> 02:25:06.333]  But statistically, it being the big news story under Obama,
[02:25:07.128 --> 02:25:11.191]  How the cops are all racist and how the cops want to kill black people and blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:11.211 --> 02:25:15.555]  And when a cop gets killed, well, they deserve it because cops are, you know, doing bad stuff.
[02:25:15.615 --> 02:25:29.447]  I mean, when you see that, that's dangerous because that is an attempt to literally overthrow the municipal and state governments with the Strong Cities Initiative created by the UN.
[02:25:29.507 --> 02:25:31.449]  You can't make this up.
[02:25:36.411 --> 02:25:46.582]  I mean, I knew this a decade ago, but three years ago, four years ago, when Attorney General Loretta Lynch came out and was on C-SPAN saying, we're going to have the U.N.
[02:25:46.642 --> 02:25:52.468]  run the police under UNESCO, and we're going to have them take the guns, and the police are our enemy until they're under U.N.
[02:25:52.508 --> 02:25:52.928]  control.
[02:25:53.208 --> 02:25:55.351]  I couldn't believe the clips we were playing.
[02:25:58.925 --> 02:26:05.128]  And the message was, we're going to tell Black Lives Matter to start killing cops till you go under our control.
[02:26:05.308 --> 02:26:06.989]  And the police did not go under their control.
[02:26:10.171 --> 02:26:17.655]  And when I articulated that on air, better than other people, I'm not saying I'm perfect, but when I finally got into gear and figured out what was going on,
[02:26:20.350 --> 02:26:21.852]  Then we got the police as an audience.
[02:26:22.793 --> 02:26:25.677]  And it wasn't just they were an audience, they were giving us information.
[02:26:26.498 --> 02:26:36.990]  And I've just seen the police, through this process, who had been trained to be globalists, who had been trained to do bad things, some of them, I've seen police departments everywhere, like, totally get it the last few years.
[02:26:37.711 --> 02:26:39.312]  And yet, we got a PR problem.
[02:26:39.672 --> 02:26:50.580]  We were maneuvered into this, and now they've totally, in most areas, gotten it, and gotten their balance, and done a judo move on this, and the police are more popular than they've ever been in this country.
[02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:53.122]  Because Americans also got it.
[02:26:54.703 --> 02:27:03.829]  Americans were like, I know mainstream media lies constantly, and all we're hearing is that cops are a bunch of KKK members, including black ones, and they hate everybody, when that's not the truth!
[02:27:05.242 --> 02:27:15.276]  And it's that process where it took so long for me to wake up, so long for the police to wake up, so long for you to wake up, but when we woke up, it was like that.
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:18.881]  It was like...
[02:27:20.376 --> 02:27:31.258]  MSNBC and CNN and Good Morning America and CBS and ABC are saying, well, five more cops got killed today, but you know, cops are doing bad stuff, so they brought it on themselves.
[02:27:31.698 --> 02:27:31.938]  What?
[02:27:32.819 --> 02:27:39.160]  Because somebody else is in another town, another city, another state, they might have done something wrong, and then other people deserve to die?
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:44.041]  That's not American, that's not common sense, and America rejected it.
[02:27:47.085 --> 02:27:49.326]  And so that's one of our big success stories right there.
[02:27:49.366 --> 02:27:54.449]  And I'll tell you another big success story was our military seven years ago telling Obama, we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:58.212]  That came from this show, our listeners, and the military.
[02:27:59.132 --> 02:28:00.573]  Saying, we're not going to be part of this.
[02:28:00.613 --> 02:28:05.516]  And then Rand Paul picked it up, Ted Cruz picked it up to their credit, and then we said no to that whole thing.
[02:28:05.836 --> 02:28:09.038]  And now you see peace breaking out in the Middle East and Trump pulling out.
[02:28:10.859 --> 02:28:11.320]  It's beautiful!
[02:28:12.338 --> 02:28:14.741]  And that's why they can't allow InfoWars to operate.
[02:28:15.101 --> 02:28:22.790]  It's why they can't allow us to be here because they can track back on almost every issue where good things happen to it being InfoWars.
[02:28:23.370 --> 02:28:29.217]  But it would have been any other platform that was big and common sense and trying to figure out the truth.
[02:28:30.959 --> 02:28:32.441]  Anybody, and that's my message to you.
[02:28:33.644 --> 02:28:36.825]  Seriously, start your own radio show, start your own YouTube, start your own Facebook, do whatever.
[02:28:36.845 --> 02:28:45.687]  You're gonna get censored too, but people are looking for common sense, and they're looking for the truth, and we're figuring it out together.
[02:28:45.747 --> 02:28:46.548]  Now, I'm gonna come back.
[02:28:46.588 --> 02:28:48.908]  I'll hit the news and some other big information.
[02:28:48.948 --> 02:28:53.709]  In fact, I got news so big, it's guaranteed to change your life in a big way.
[02:28:53.729 --> 02:28:54.710]  Stay with us.
[02:28:54.730 --> 02:28:55.410]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:55.930 --> 02:28:59.211]  This is the InfoWar, the most censored broadcast in the world.
[02:29:03.786 --> 02:29:05.646]  We're ending the year.
[02:29:06.026 --> 02:29:06.987]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[02:29:07.067 --> 02:29:08.007]  It's been an insane year.
[02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:16.868]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[02:29:17.969 --> 02:29:28.911]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[02:29:29.951 --> 02:29:30.751]  And that the globalists
[02:29:31.878 --> 02:29:38.120]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:43.562]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[02:29:43.582 --> 02:29:46.263]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[02:29:46.603 --> 02:29:48.564]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[02:29:50.224 --> 02:29:52.125]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[02:29:52.145 --> 02:29:54.506]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[02:29:55.366 --> 02:29:57.987]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[02:29:59.367 --> 02:30:00.748]  But our aircraft didn't have
[02:30:02.438 --> 02:30:04.699]  Radar.
[02:30:04.839 --> 02:30:15.963]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[02:30:16.163 --> 02:30:26.727]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[02:30:27.727 --> 02:30:29.708]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[02:30:30.717 --> 02:30:33.760]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:41.866]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[02:30:41.886 --> 02:30:45.469]  For as we're showing, it's Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[02:30:45.529 --> 02:30:46.550]  That's a separate battle.
[02:30:47.351 --> 02:30:47.511]  And so...
[02:30:54.605 --> 02:30:59.386]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[02:30:59.866 --> 02:31:02.627]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[02:31:03.507 --> 02:31:08.888]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[02:31:09.769 --> 02:31:17.451]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[02:31:19.271 --> 02:31:22.852]  And we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most.
[02:31:23.797 --> 02:31:29.621]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[02:31:29.681 --> 02:31:33.544]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[02:31:34.531 --> 02:31:43.474]  And I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[02:31:43.874 --> 02:31:56.877]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[02:31:57.097 --> 02:31:58.818]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[02:31:59.833 --> 02:32:05.980]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out.
[02:32:06.835 --> 02:32:08.116]  Until January 1st.
[02:32:08.797 --> 02:32:10.538]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support.
[02:32:11.138 --> 02:32:14.001]  Selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[02:32:14.521 --> 02:32:17.984]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[02:32:18.744 --> 02:32:21.807]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything.
[02:32:22.647 --> 02:32:24.449]  Double Patriot points on your next order.
[02:32:24.829 --> 02:32:26.090]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:29.753]  That is extended, but only a few days left until...
[02:32:31.047 --> 02:32:31.828]  The end of this year.
[02:32:32.708 --> 02:32:44.537]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[02:32:44.597 --> 02:32:50.361]  And in fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item, like colloidal silver, or something like that.
[02:32:50.401 --> 02:32:56.065]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[02:32:56.465 --> 02:32:57.946]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:58.127 --> 02:32:59.748]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:33:05.808 --> 02:33:12.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.013 --> 02:33:31.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide
[02:33:36.101 --> 02:33:39.044]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:41.566 --> 02:33:47.172]  Alright, a lot of you have been listening for decades.
[02:33:48.273 --> 02:33:54.799]  And so, you'll remember when I began to promote silver when it was like $4 an ounce and gold was $300 an ounce.
[02:33:54.859 --> 02:33:56.801]  And when it hit $2,000 and silver hit $50,
[02:34:01.085 --> 02:34:04.387]  I said to listeners, I said, hey, compared to fiat currencies, this is a great deal.
[02:34:04.947 --> 02:34:11.391]  I said, I'm exiting the market and I believe that you're going to have a 50% correction or more in the next few years.
[02:34:12.552 --> 02:34:13.492]  And that indeed happened.
[02:34:14.313 --> 02:34:15.393]  That 100% happened.
[02:34:16.654 --> 02:34:24.919]  And I remember it well because I was in the process of my ex-wife divorcing me and we had some silver and gold in the safety deposit box and some buried in the backyard.
[02:34:27.526 --> 02:34:29.747]  I'm like, hey, we need to sell this on the market right now.
[02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:31.448]  I've just been announcing it's going to go down.
[02:34:31.468 --> 02:34:32.669]  It's like six years ago.
[02:34:32.689 --> 02:34:34.270]  And she didn't believe me.
[02:34:34.290 --> 02:34:38.112]  So by the time we sold it, it lost about 40% of its value, both the silver and the gold.
[02:34:38.972 --> 02:34:40.313]  But that's just the way things happen.
[02:34:42.774 --> 02:34:47.057]  But I had to tell listeners, even though I could have had a few more years of selling gold,
[02:34:48.055 --> 02:34:53.017]  Even though I believed in it and had a good gut feeling and a good intellectual feeling, I had to say, get out of it.
[02:34:53.557 --> 02:34:58.780]  Clearly, if things go into hyperinflation down the road, silver and gold are going to be back bigger than doubts.
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:05.543]  And I'll try to start promoting it before it goes up to the top again, so that, you know, people can be successful.
[02:35:06.963 --> 02:35:12.666]  A lot of listeners, I mean, when I say a lot of listeners, I got thousands of letters and calls saying, wow, thank you.
[02:35:13.046 --> 02:35:14.227]  We got out of silver and gold.
[02:35:15.382 --> 02:35:19.284]  And we noticed you quit promoting it, even though you were on a network that did, once that happened.
[02:35:19.984 --> 02:35:20.984]  And I said, absolutely.
[02:35:22.145 --> 02:35:38.491]  Now, when I tell you I was offered hundreds of millions of dollars, that sounds like a lot, but Bitcoin hit, just Bitcoin itself, there's over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin hit 95 billion last October.
[02:35:39.991 --> 02:35:41.432]  Now, about this time,
[02:35:42.688 --> 02:35:46.712]  Because there were Bitcoin advertisers on stations we're on in the network, and I'm not saying anybody's bad for doing that.
[02:35:46.732 --> 02:35:47.613]  It's a free country.
[02:35:48.513 --> 02:35:50.095]  But I never took Bitcoin money.
[02:35:52.257 --> 02:35:54.859]  In fact, once some slipped through in advertising and I said, no, give it back.
[02:35:56.381 --> 02:35:59.163]  And it was because it was always a push new currencies or whatever.
[02:35:59.203 --> 02:36:00.525]  And I had a few guests on about it.
[02:36:00.545 --> 02:36:05.910]  And I said, you know, I get cryptocurrency and I get that, you know, it's just fiat like the others.
[02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:08.092]  But I just said, you know, at a gut level,
[02:36:09.466 --> 02:36:11.708]  I feel like the establishment kind of launched this.
[02:36:12.689 --> 02:36:25.078]  Because I got approached by a Soros associate, who I later learned was a high-level Soros associate, and offered a lot of free Bitcoin, a lot of stuff to promote Bitcoin, and a lot of advertisement.
[02:36:25.198 --> 02:36:27.000]  We're talking seven, eight years ago.
[02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:28.301]  And I didn't do it.
[02:36:28.521 --> 02:36:29.962]  But I allowed folks to talk about it.
[02:36:30.062 --> 02:36:31.864]  I just said, you know, I'm not promoting it.
[02:36:31.904 --> 02:36:32.664]  I have a bad feeling.
[02:36:33.505 --> 02:36:38.169]  And I don't want to just make money on something going up, and then other people get hurt when it goes down.
[02:36:39.219 --> 02:36:45.122]  They call me a chump or whatever, but you know, I got good luck in other ways.
[02:36:45.342 --> 02:36:46.982]  I'd rather have healthy kids and a bunch of money.
[02:36:47.002 --> 02:36:47.723]  You know what I mean?
[02:36:47.743 --> 02:36:48.963]  I mean, I think that's how God works.
[02:36:49.083 --> 02:36:52.885]  It's, it's, it's, it's, I just can't go around screwing people over.
[02:36:54.125 --> 02:37:04.470]  The reason I tell this story is I've been offered, so when you turn the money down, it goes up and up, millions of dollars to promote marijuana stocks.
[02:37:06.101 --> 02:37:11.702]  Well, A, I think marijuana's been made so strong now that it causes brain damage in a lot of people.
[02:37:13.022 --> 02:37:16.043]  Are there some people that are already type A personalities that some of it might help them?
[02:37:16.063 --> 02:37:16.223]  Yeah.
[02:37:16.663 --> 02:37:18.744]  Are there thousands of incredible things it does for the body?
[02:37:18.764 --> 02:37:21.204]  Glaucoma, you name it, absolutely.
[02:37:21.304 --> 02:37:22.704]  I'm not questioning people.
[02:37:22.844 --> 02:37:23.464]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:37:25.625 --> 02:37:30.686]  I am not promoting marijuana stocks because I believe it's another bubble.
[02:37:31.744 --> 02:37:40.528]  I heard marijuana stocks being aired by the network the other day, and I said, listen, you air one more marijuana spot, I will leave today, and I have the authorization to.
[02:37:40.548 --> 02:37:46.611]  So what I'm trying to explain to people is, you sell out in little ways, you might as well sell out big.
[02:37:46.671 --> 02:37:50.393]  I mean, if I'm going to screw people, why not start robbing banks like the Globals are kidnapping kids?
[02:37:51.793 --> 02:37:52.674]  I don't want to kidnap kids.
[02:37:52.694 --> 02:37:53.474]  I don't want to rob banks.
[02:37:53.594 --> 02:37:56.015]  See, I'm the guy that wants to be on the other side of that.
[02:37:56.095 --> 02:37:57.816]  It doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[02:37:57.836 --> 02:37:59.777]  It doesn't mean sometimes I hear a rebroadcast.
[02:38:01.621 --> 02:38:04.003]  And I said, women pick the sex of the baby.
[02:38:04.023 --> 02:38:09.968]  And I know full well that women are XX and men are XY and that the sperm that makes it into the egg picks it.
[02:38:09.988 --> 02:38:11.849]  So you can say males do, but then it gets more complex.
[02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:14.572]  What I meant was mitochondrial DNA is done by the woman.
[02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:21.738]  And then in the first few days of the zygote, the female decides the main interlocutor of the genetic expression.
[02:38:21.778 --> 02:38:22.398]  That's what I was studying.
[02:38:22.418 --> 02:38:22.878]  I was going on.
[02:38:23.079 --> 02:38:24.620]  But then I say it doesn't matter.
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:26.902]  It sounds ridiculous because it's wrong.
[02:38:27.262 --> 02:38:29.284]  Men or the sperm that makes it.
[02:38:30.362 --> 02:38:33.443]  An XX or an XY, that decides what the baby's gonna be.
[02:38:34.883 --> 02:38:38.264]  So, what I'm saying is, I make mistakes.
[02:38:38.364 --> 02:38:39.644]  Like, what does sperm do with Bitcoin?
[02:38:39.904 --> 02:38:41.244]  That's just an example of the latest thing.
[02:38:41.264 --> 02:38:42.244]  I heard a rebroadcast.
[02:38:42.264 --> 02:38:43.185]  I'm like, that's not true.
[02:38:43.205 --> 02:38:43.825]  Why did I say that?
[02:38:44.245 --> 02:38:48.846]  Because I was thinking about another study at another level, something else, and I kind of just conflate them together.
[02:38:49.786 --> 02:38:53.027]  So don't sit here and pin your thing on everything I say either.
[02:38:53.627 --> 02:38:56.787]  The difference is, I'm not trying to sell you a bill of goods.
[02:38:57.628 --> 02:38:59.328]  In fact, I'm dying to not do it.
[02:39:00.754 --> 02:39:03.715]  So, let me get to the big enchilada here.
[02:39:05.676 --> 02:39:08.878]  I had 6, 7, 8 companies, half million, million.
[02:39:08.898 --> 02:39:09.818]  These were real companies.
[02:39:10.478 --> 02:39:12.199]  Companies with billions in capital.
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:14.880]  With contracts.
[02:39:15.901 --> 02:39:18.382]  And if you don't believe in us, here's this Hollywood star.
[02:39:18.562 --> 02:39:20.283]  They've made $20 million over this last two months.
[02:39:22.216 --> 02:39:24.297]  And I just said, you know, I'm sorry.
[02:39:24.317 --> 02:39:26.498]  I think this is a tulip bubble.
[02:39:26.779 --> 02:39:27.739]  Oh, that's BS.
[02:39:27.819 --> 02:39:28.860]  It's only going to get even bigger.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:29.780]  It's going to replace everything.
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:32.862]  And I said, no, my gut tells me big banks are involved in this.
[02:39:34.343 --> 02:39:37.525]  And they're going to ride this up and take the money out and then screw all the little people.
[02:39:38.065 --> 02:39:39.226]  And I said, I'm not going to do it.
[02:39:41.007 --> 02:39:43.108]  Because I wasn't sure about Bitcoin eight years ago.
[02:39:43.128 --> 02:39:45.489]  I was sure about it two years ago.
[02:39:46.530 --> 02:39:47.771]  But I had a bad feeling.
[02:39:48.527 --> 02:39:53.932]  And when it hit the biggest thing in the world, I said, maybe I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong, but I'm not going to take any money from it.
[02:39:57.676 --> 02:40:03.341]  Now, I'm not here bragging, hey, I turned down tens of millions of dollars a month, which could have funded everything.
[02:40:03.462 --> 02:40:09.648]  I mean, my goodness, money like that, that's five times the money we make a year.
[02:40:09.708 --> 02:40:11.770]  I mean, it would fund everything.
[02:40:12.759 --> 02:40:15.140]  Well, my employees would all be driving, you know, brand new cars.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:15.620]  But you know what?
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.282]  My employees don't want stuff like that off the blood of old ladies.
[02:40:20.642 --> 02:40:22.383]  And their retirement money stolen.
[02:40:23.003 --> 02:40:28.345]  So, when I tell you that I believe in something, it means I believe in it.
[02:40:29.986 --> 02:40:35.168]  All I got is my... Tony Montana says, there's two things in this world, and I don't break it for anybody.
[02:40:36.044 --> 02:40:37.165]  My word and my balls.
[02:40:37.665 --> 02:40:38.666]  And no women, no kids.
[02:40:38.686 --> 02:40:39.406]  I'm not going to kill any women.
[02:40:39.426 --> 02:40:40.147]  I'm not going to kill any kids.
[02:40:40.747 --> 02:40:42.248]  And you know, I think those are good rules.
[02:40:42.268 --> 02:40:43.349]  You're not going to break my word.
[02:40:43.369 --> 02:40:44.650]  You're not going to break my balls.
[02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:46.431]  I'm not going to screw women and kids over.
[02:40:47.111 --> 02:40:49.473]  I think those are kind of good rules to live my life.
[02:40:49.713 --> 02:40:50.914]  You're another mean, aggressive man.
[02:40:50.934 --> 02:40:51.754]  You want to screw me over?
[02:40:52.155 --> 02:40:53.656]  I will politically kill you.
[02:40:54.278 --> 02:40:55.318]  You want to physically try to kill me?
[02:40:55.598 --> 02:40:55.979]  Good luck.
[02:40:56.019 --> 02:40:56.539]  See what happens.
[02:40:56.819 --> 02:40:58.500]  I'll kill you in a second to defend myself.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.361]  It's just like wiping dust off my shoes.
[02:41:01.921 --> 02:41:03.001]  It's the easiest thing in the world.
[02:41:03.401 --> 02:41:04.902]  Guys think it's impressive to kill people.
[02:41:05.462 --> 02:41:06.623]  That's like wiping your ass.
[02:41:07.283 --> 02:41:08.123]  So secondhand.
[02:41:09.624 --> 02:41:12.065]  Most people don't have what it takes to kill, though.
[02:41:12.485 --> 02:41:15.586]  They have these ingrained systems that hold them back.
[02:41:16.206 --> 02:41:20.508]  And it's those same false instincts that keep them from taking action when they need to.
[02:41:21.328 --> 02:41:23.909]  Well, I am going to take action against them.
[02:41:25.984 --> 02:41:34.269]  And that's why, when I tell you this, it funds our operation, it stands against the globalists, but that's not why it's even important.
[02:41:36.971 --> 02:41:37.531]  It's the truth.
[02:41:38.812 --> 02:41:40.573]  Document cam shot, please, for TV viewers.
[02:41:42.214 --> 02:41:45.896]  How adding iodine to salt boosted Americans' IQs?
[02:41:47.157 --> 02:41:48.898]  That's Discover Magazine, but don't believe them.
[02:41:49.378 --> 02:41:50.699]  The New York Times, 2006.
[02:41:53.490 --> 02:41:56.853]  In raising the world's IQ, the secret is in the salt.
[02:41:56.873 --> 02:42:07.863]  But you read later, it's ionized salt, a small amount of bound iodine, not even fully absorbed, and it talks about 10 to 20 percent.
[02:42:09.104 --> 02:42:11.386]  The average is 15 percent IQ increase.
[02:42:11.786 --> 02:42:14.709]  Increased fertility, increased skin health, everything.
[02:42:15.049 --> 02:42:15.850]  It's the big secret.
[02:42:17.659 --> 02:42:20.000]  The effects of iodine on the intelligence of children.
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:22.301]  The meta-analysis of studies conducted in China.
[02:42:22.621 --> 02:42:29.323]  China adds iodine to the school lunch menu of the water and of the salt.
[02:42:31.544 --> 02:42:34.505]  We started adding it in the 20s but pulled it by the 70s.
[02:42:34.585 --> 02:42:36.786]  Now that's what I'm talking about.
[02:42:36.806 --> 02:42:39.087]  So I don't just tell you this isn't money.
[02:42:39.127 --> 02:42:44.529]  This is your brain, your tissue, your fertility, your ovaries, your testicles, your damn eyeballs.
[02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:49.112]  Get X3, get X2 at m4warstore.com.
[02:42:49.553 --> 02:42:50.133]  It's real.
[02:42:50.193 --> 02:42:52.095]  It's not like Bitcoin or the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:52.235 --> 02:42:52.876]  It's real.
[02:42:53.737 --> 02:42:54.798]  It changes the world.
[02:42:55.679 --> 02:42:57.400]  Your whole family needs it now.
[02:42:57.861 --> 02:42:59.282]  Get it or you're insane!
[02:43:02.805 --> 02:43:04.347]  Since the time of Plato, 2300 plus years ago,
[02:43:08.968 --> 02:43:11.610]  Elites believe that the Earth was overpopulated.
[02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:20.955]  Now, you could argue that today, but in the time of Plato, there wasn't more than a hundred thousand people on the Greek islands.
[02:43:22.115 --> 02:43:27.618]  But in his Republic, he wrote about humans crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[02:43:29.099 --> 02:43:30.120]  And it was his ideas
[02:43:31.297 --> 02:43:35.762]  Two thousand years later, they were picked up by Malthus.
[02:43:36.763 --> 02:43:37.423]  Sir Malthus.
[02:43:38.424 --> 02:43:49.276]  Malthus wanted to herd people in Ireland and in England to pour people into tiny, small, 200-foot apartments so that they would fester with disease and die.
[02:43:49.296 --> 02:43:51.918]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[02:43:52.699 --> 02:43:59.643]  That means you just believe in making things worse, so that you get rid of the poor people, you get rid of the dumb people, you get rid of the stupid people.
[02:44:00.324 --> 02:44:14.292]  He predicted that within a hundred years, that was the 1700s, he predicted by the 1800s, the Earth would reach its carrying potential, and there would be a planetary collapse of the entire human population.
[02:44:14.992 --> 02:44:20.615]  So when you hear about eugenics, and you read about the UN saying we're overpopulated, and you see them pushing for
[02:44:21.656 --> 02:44:22.936]  Global one-child policies.
[02:44:24.337 --> 02:44:35.099]  Remember that this has been a long-term view of aristocrats, of royalty, of oligarchs, of plutocrats for 2,000 plus years.
[02:44:36.219 --> 02:44:41.660]  And really what they use this for is a way to dehumanize the general public.
[02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:43.081]  Why educate?
[02:44:43.161 --> 02:44:44.181]  Why have sewage?
[02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:47.662]  Why have sanitation if these people are animals to begin with?
[02:44:48.842 --> 02:44:55.428]  But see, once sanitation and things were adopted 150 years ago, infectious diseases went down over 95%.
[02:44:55.868 --> 02:44:58.430]  So then the eugenicists met and they said, what are we going to do?
[02:44:59.431 --> 02:45:02.573]  People aren't dying from infectious diseases, the Malthusian plan is failing.
[02:45:02.613 --> 02:45:07.897]  They said, we'll take all these good scientists and people that have developed all these vaccines and things that are good.
[02:45:08.718 --> 02:45:13.544]  And we'll take control of these with modern medical science through the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:45:14.225 --> 02:45:16.949]  And we'll actually control it and make everything worse.
[02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:19.572]  Cancer was incredibly rare 100 years ago.
[02:45:20.193 --> 02:45:24.018]  By the 20s, the Rockefellers had discovered most of it was viral and weaponized it.
[02:45:24.799 --> 02:45:26.341]  And there's hundreds of other examples.
[02:45:28.001 --> 02:45:37.606]  So when you pull back from this and understand that it's not that environmentalism is bad, it's good, but the bad guys run it, not to help the earth or people, but to control it.
[02:45:38.046 --> 02:45:44.189]  When you realize that vaccine technology is good and real, but that bad guys have it and are adding Trojan horses, then you understand.
[02:45:44.949 --> 02:45:51.092]  Just like computers are good, but then they can be used for bad with Trojan horses to control.
[02:45:51.112 --> 02:45:55.194]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[02:45:56.525 --> 02:45:58.147]  That's why you have an attack on the family.
[02:45:58.367 --> 02:45:59.889]  That's why you have an attack on the middle class.
[02:46:00.190 --> 02:46:04.115]  That's why globalists want to make populations poor and stupid and controllable.
[02:46:04.836 --> 02:46:07.399]  Because only one level of the eugenics operation
[02:46:08.897 --> 02:46:10.819]  It says they're actually just gonna get rid of the poor people.
[02:46:11.599 --> 02:46:12.240]  That's bad enough.
[02:46:12.780 --> 02:46:20.707]  The truth is they're just using it as an excuse to humanize all life, throw chivalry out the window, and treat their fellow humans like they're animals.
[02:46:21.547 --> 02:46:28.693]  Because the globalists are sociopathic and psychotic in their spectrum, and they project their own hatred on the public.
[02:46:29.634 --> 02:46:49.629]  And their own loathing of themselves on the public, and then cover it, claiming that they're nothing but social Darwinists, carrying out a cleansing of the Earth, when they're the ones with the open-air genetic engineering, they're the ones with the gene splicing, they're the ones with the human-animal chimeras, they're the ones with the atmospheric manipulations, when they're the ones endangering the entire planet.
[02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:52.171]  So as we go into the new year, understand this.
[02:46:52.191 --> 02:46:53.051]  A 2,300-year plan
[02:46:55.353 --> 02:46:57.496]  He's fighting against a plan for a pro-human future.
[02:46:57.836 --> 02:46:59.218]  Choose renaissance, not death.
[02:46:59.538 --> 02:47:00.579]  Choose Infowars.
[02:47:06.746 --> 02:47:09.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:38.063 --> 02:47:48.709]  There's seven and a half billion of us on a small planetoid on a tiny galaxy deep, deep on the edge of the universe.
[02:47:48.729 --> 02:47:52.531]  All right, I want to hit some final stories.
[02:47:52.611 --> 02:47:53.672]  Matt Bracken's going to take over.
[02:47:53.692 --> 02:47:54.872]  I'm going to host some in the next hour.
[02:47:55.553 --> 02:47:56.673]  California legal alien.
[02:47:58.414 --> 02:47:59.895]  Cop killer taken into custody.
[02:48:00.355 --> 02:48:00.936]  We covered this
[02:48:02.205 --> 02:48:04.246]  On Monday, but it's getting big news now.
[02:48:04.647 --> 02:48:06.568]  Next day's news today.
[02:48:07.208 --> 02:48:12.652]  Group touted by Democrats for bombshell Russia report was behind Alabama Senate race tricks.
[02:48:13.813 --> 02:48:20.057]  The Democrats went and funded Russian bots, which just means you go hire a company in Russia and then it geolocates.
[02:48:20.997 --> 02:48:28.602]  I could go get an apartment in Moscow and hook up servers and, you know, push stuff and they go, Oh, look, Putin's behind it, which we told you was going on.
[02:48:28.902 --> 02:48:29.903]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[02:48:31.912 --> 02:48:39.373]  And then I met this guy once at a charity event that I got invited to that I never talked about on air.
[02:48:40.874 --> 02:48:44.214]  And LeeAnn McAdoo interviewed him and so did Jakari Jackson after I had a chance to meet him.
[02:48:44.875 --> 02:48:50.876]  And just a month ago I said, you know, who's that oldest World War II vet in Austin, the black guy?
[02:48:51.256 --> 02:48:52.136]  He's really cool.
[02:48:52.696 --> 02:48:54.336]  I want you to get him in studio.
[02:48:54.376 --> 02:48:55.957]  We're going to drink Jack Daniels together.
[02:48:55.977 --> 02:48:57.037]  Because he drank
[02:48:57.737 --> 02:49:00.059]  Couple shots of Jack Daniels, smokes cars every day.
[02:49:00.599 --> 02:49:01.480]  Said he was never sick.
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:02.681]  Hurt his leg.
[02:49:03.302 --> 02:49:05.483]  They put him in a rehabilitation center.
[02:49:05.503 --> 02:49:06.604]  He caught pneumonia and died.
[02:49:07.885 --> 02:49:10.988]  And I got really mad when I heard this this morning.
[02:49:11.008 --> 02:49:14.070]  Because I wanted to interview him and he's dead now.
[02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:17.053]  But also, my YouTube's gone.
[02:49:17.993 --> 02:49:18.494]  35,000 videos.
[02:49:18.834 --> 02:49:19.595]  So we couldn't find it.
[02:49:19.615 --> 02:49:21.876]  Took them hours to even find the interviews today.
[02:49:22.757 --> 02:49:23.558]  In our own servers.
[02:49:24.919 --> 02:49:25.039]  And
[02:49:28.228 --> 02:49:29.769]  I just had a feeling about a couple months ago.
[02:49:29.809 --> 02:49:31.390]  I said, let's get him in studio.
[02:49:31.410 --> 02:49:34.871]  They're like, well, you know, he's kind of old.
[02:49:35.272 --> 02:49:37.333]  Let's smoke cigars and drink Jack Daniels together.
[02:49:38.433 --> 02:49:39.034]  He's dead now.
[02:49:39.934 --> 02:49:42.235]  African-American, 112 years old.
[02:49:42.896 --> 02:49:44.376]  Richard Overton will play that in a minute.
[02:49:44.396 --> 02:49:45.597]  So I can't talk to him now.
[02:49:48.558 --> 02:49:49.599]  Not mad that we didn't get him on.
[02:49:49.619 --> 02:49:52.180]  And I mumbled a lot of orders around here.
[02:49:53.181 --> 02:49:57.203]  Hell, he might have already been in rehabilitation center two months ago, but, uh,
[02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:05.010]  It's just, 103's forever when you're just a little kid, so Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:07.151]  That's the Gravedigger song, Willie Nelson.
[02:50:08.651 --> 02:50:15.733]  But man, 112's forever when you're just 45, so... Richard Overton, live forever.
[02:50:18.053 --> 02:50:24.155]  And see, to me, somebody like him, a World War II combat vet, got in when he was older.
[02:50:25.075 --> 02:50:25.555]  Volunteer.
[02:50:27.344 --> 02:50:29.525]  That's the kind of person that gets me excited.
[02:50:29.845 --> 02:50:31.866]  Not some stupid-ass Hollywood person.
[02:50:31.886 --> 02:50:32.367]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:33.667 --> 02:50:36.369]  Let me stop right there, because I didn't plug this properly earlier.
[02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:43.872]  And it's so incredibly important that if I don't plug it properly, people aren't going to listen to me and the solutions.
[02:50:46.513 --> 02:50:49.835]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[02:50:50.135 --> 02:50:54.057]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water.
[02:50:56.257 --> 02:50:57.077]  To sustain life.
[02:50:58.678 --> 02:51:00.418]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[02:51:00.518 --> 02:51:04.719]  There is one good halogen in the body and it's pure atomic iodine.
[02:51:05.259 --> 02:51:07.280]  Most forms are bound so you don't absorb them.
[02:51:07.980 --> 02:51:20.803]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken down type are better than nothing because your body recognizes it and takes it on and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine and the other bad ones.
[02:51:23.764 --> 02:51:23.884]  And
[02:51:25.319 --> 02:51:27.620]  There's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:28.860]  How about physical wealth?
[02:51:29.821 --> 02:51:31.861]  When I forget to take my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:33.442]  We have X2.
[02:51:33.522 --> 02:51:38.824]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[02:51:39.244 --> 02:51:40.745]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[02:51:41.837 --> 02:51:52.925]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize, and this other form of iodine, and the other form, all three, so that it's better absorbable.
[02:51:53.065 --> 02:51:54.126]  That's X3.
[02:51:54.486 --> 02:51:55.507]  We have a limited supply of X2.
[02:51:55.707 --> 02:51:56.487]  It's our final run.
[02:51:57.308 --> 02:51:58.149]  But here are the headlines.
[02:51:58.689 --> 02:52:01.691]  How adding iodine to salt boosts an American IQ.
[02:52:02.992 --> 02:52:05.674]  That's Discovery Magazine, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:07.984 --> 02:52:09.866]  And then we've got the New York Times.
[02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:13.929]  Now again, this is from 12 years ago.
[02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:18.732]  In raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[02:52:18.812 --> 02:52:19.253]  But it's not.
[02:52:19.273 --> 02:52:24.957]  It says right here, adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[02:52:25.858 --> 02:52:27.619]  Boosted IQ 10 to 20 points.
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:29.261]  Increased fertility.
[02:52:30.552 --> 02:52:31.413]  China's doing it.
[02:52:31.713 --> 02:52:36.156]  The effects of iodine on intelligence in children's and meta-analysis of studies conducted in China.
[02:52:36.476 --> 02:52:40.178]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[02:52:42.860 --> 02:52:43.720]  Why do I say that?
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:59.490]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation, major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[02:53:01.218 --> 02:53:05.959]  Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, thought they were having a genetic breakdown.
[02:53:05.979 --> 02:53:12.480]  The truth was they weren't getting iodine because it had been played out of their soil so it wasn't in the produce.
[02:53:16.741 --> 02:53:23.583]  You fund us and you get atomic iodine with the other two types of iodine so it's fully absorbable.
[02:53:25.383 --> 02:53:28.564]  That's why we have survival fuel of X3.
[02:53:31.107 --> 02:53:35.413]  And we still have X2 that is just the pure atomic iodide, but this has the vitamin C to stabilize it.
[02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:37.270]  The other two types.
[02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:51.353]  And again, it's not as strong as X2, because some of the scientists and experts explained to us that we should probably reduce, even though it's FDA approved, the level we had, the amount that was in there, because some people might overuse it.
[02:53:51.713 --> 02:53:59.314]  And it's very powerful, so that's why this is weaker, but it has the other two iodines and the vitamin C, so it's more absorbable.
[02:53:59.374 --> 02:53:59.794]  It's better.
[02:54:00.374 --> 02:54:03.455]  I can keep selling X2 until the cows come home, and it's there.
[02:54:03.835 --> 02:54:05.155]  But this, this is the best.
[02:54:06.991 --> 02:54:16.153]  We're in talks to develop something with a major university scientist that's got an added patented ingredient that does a little something special to the upload, but we're always improving.
[02:54:16.633 --> 02:54:21.935]  X3, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:22.235 --> 02:54:25.195]  Okay.
[02:54:28.216 --> 02:54:29.516]  Let's go ahead and get into this.
[02:54:29.556 --> 02:54:31.037]  And I kind of already mentioned it.
[02:54:31.837 --> 02:54:35.598]  I met this fellow, thought he was pretty smart, amazing, and he was like a hundred and
[02:54:36.844 --> 02:54:37.645]  Nine years old.
[02:54:38.565 --> 02:54:40.467]  Richard Overton, World War II vet.
[02:54:41.908 --> 02:54:46.691]  And, uh, drank, worked all day, drank a little bit of whiskey, smoked cigars, just a really smart, funny guy.
[02:54:46.751 --> 02:54:47.211]  He's dead.
[02:54:47.231 --> 02:54:48.352]  Died of pneumonia.
[02:54:49.813 --> 02:54:52.995]  And here's a couple clips of LeeAnn McAdoo and Jakari Jackson interviewing him.
[02:54:53.415 --> 02:54:55.977]  So another American legend has gone on to the Lord.
[02:54:56.017 --> 02:54:56.417]  Here it is.
[02:54:57.198 --> 02:54:56.417]  109.
[02:54:57.218 --> 02:55:02.201]  109.
[02:54:57.838 --> 02:55:02.201]  Trying to make run on 10.
[02:55:04.103 --> 02:55:05.083]  I think I'll make it.
[02:55:05.624 --> 02:55:05.884]  Yeah.
[02:55:06.698 --> 02:55:07.038]  I hope.
[02:55:08.079 --> 02:55:11.500]  So do you think the world is better now or back then?
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:18.003]  The world is a whole lot better, but some things are getting a little different.
[02:55:18.943 --> 02:55:23.045]  People are getting a little stronger, getting a little meaner.
[02:55:23.625 --> 02:55:30.908]  They're shooting the police, and they're killing each other, and they're having fires every night.
[02:55:32.367 --> 02:55:34.370]  No, that didn't happen when I was in the country.
[02:55:35.432 --> 02:55:36.613]  That wasn't happening.
[02:55:37.194 --> 02:55:38.276]  But now it's happening.
[02:55:39.317 --> 02:55:43.263]  Well, I read somewhere that you like coffee with whiskey in it.
[02:55:43.984 --> 02:55:45.106]  It's good medicine.
[02:55:45.126 --> 02:55:46.488]  That's what I take it for.
[02:55:46.608 --> 02:55:48.651]  My daddy taught me how to do that.
[02:55:49.446 --> 02:55:51.347]  So what do you think about the Second Amendment?
[02:55:51.708 --> 02:55:57.832]  Do you think that's important for us nowadays, or do you think we should do away with the right to bear arms?
[02:55:58.592 --> 02:56:01.154]  No, I think everything's getting something.
[02:56:01.474 --> 02:56:05.277]  It was better here for a while, but it seems like it's kind of changing a little bit.
[02:56:06.498 --> 02:56:06.798]  Yeah?
[02:56:06.818 --> 02:56:13.122]  I don't know whether it's the people changing it or just God changing it.
[02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:15.104]  He don't go the bad way, He go the good way.
[02:56:16.335 --> 02:56:19.357]  Some of these things are getting pretty bad in places.
[02:56:20.617 --> 02:56:23.839]  Do you think the world is more free now?
[02:56:23.979 --> 02:56:26.361]  Yes, it's getting better.
[02:56:27.821 --> 02:56:29.062]  It's getting better, of course.
[02:56:29.082 --> 02:56:34.985]  Some of you had things go up and down, some of you had things go down.
[02:56:35.065 --> 02:56:38.207]  You just got to live through what's coming.
[02:56:39.116 --> 02:56:46.302]  Well, before we go, is there anything you want to say to the veterans, to the young veterans, or to the young people out there?
[02:56:46.342 --> 02:56:54.610]  You've got a lot of wisdom, so... Yes, I'm still their friend.
[02:56:54.650 --> 02:56:56.431]  They want me to go back to Washington.
[02:56:56.491 --> 02:57:01.316]  I didn't want to go, but they want me to go back again, talk to the president, so...
[02:57:03.112 --> 02:57:06.833]  I'll go back and see what's going on, but I want everything to be lovely.
[02:57:06.853 --> 02:57:10.375]  I don't want nothing to be crossed up where I don't like.
[02:57:10.855 --> 02:57:15.716]  Well, how does that make you feel, being the oldest living World War II veteran?
[02:57:16.337 --> 02:57:19.338]  I just can't believe it.
[02:57:19.478 --> 02:57:20.278]  I can't feel it.
[02:57:20.358 --> 02:57:21.418]  I just can't believe it.
[02:57:22.559 --> 02:57:24.499]  But see, it mainly got to do with it.
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:28.141]  You got to go up and ask God about that situation.
[02:57:28.561 --> 02:57:28.801]  Yeah.
[02:57:28.821 --> 02:57:30.201]  I don't know how I'm going to live.
[02:57:30.421 --> 02:57:31.882]  I'll have to live five more years.
[02:57:33.005 --> 02:57:37.469]  Wow, Richard Overton is now dead, but part of history.
[02:57:37.509 --> 02:57:39.451]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:57:53.061 --> 02:57:56.704]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[02:57:57.605 --> 02:58:02.910]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:03.490 --> 02:58:05.052]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[02:58:05.952 --> 02:58:11.617]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[02:58:12.598 --> 02:58:21.981]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[02:58:22.741 --> 02:58:23.261]  It's that simple.
[02:58:23.922 --> 02:58:24.842]  So, it's epic.
[02:58:24.922 --> 02:58:25.542]  It's amazing.
[02:58:25.782 --> 02:58:27.283]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[02:58:27.863 --> 02:58:30.284]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[02:58:31.904 --> 02:58:36.967]  This is the stuff of legends, and I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[02:58:37.587 --> 02:58:39.888]  You are not just part of the info war.
[02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:41.109]  You're the core.
[02:58:41.149 --> 02:58:41.709]  You're the heart.
[02:58:41.810 --> 02:58:42.430]  You're everything.
[02:58:43.250 --> 02:58:56.398]  It's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own...
[02:58:59.221 --> 02:59:07.504]  Whatever it is, just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[02:59:07.564 --> 02:59:09.025]  Again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[02:59:09.125 --> 02:59:09.725]  I love you.
[02:59:10.825 --> 02:59:11.645]  I appreciate you.
[02:59:11.665 --> 02:59:13.666]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[02:59:13.686 --> 02:59:15.467]  I feel like you are me.
[02:59:15.627 --> 02:59:17.147]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[02:59:17.707 --> 02:59:23.489]  I just want everybody to realize out of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[02:59:23.929 --> 02:59:24.890]  What we're covering is
[02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:28.652]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[02:59:29.033 --> 02:59:30.994]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[02:59:31.435 --> 02:59:41.743]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and InfoWars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[02:59:42.063 --> 02:59:42.404]  Do it.
[02:59:43.024 --> 02:59:44.625]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[02:59:44.645 --> 02:59:47.428]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win.
[02:59:47.468 --> 02:59:49.409]  We're going to build an incredible world together.
[02:59:49.630 --> 02:59:51.031]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[02:59:55.037 --> 03:00:01.001]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.247 --> 03:00:14.769]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[03:00:21.474 --> 03:00:25.615]  Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[03:00:27.236 --> 03:00:31.057]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[03:00:32.738 --> 03:00:36.199]  So, Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:44.802]  Gravedigger, when you dig my grave, would you make it shallow?
[03:00:47.815 --> 03:00:48.695]  What's the old saying?
[03:00:48.715 --> 03:00:53.579]  When I die, bury me under the old apple tree, so I might touch your lips again.
[03:00:59.017 --> 03:01:02.759]  A lot of people fought and died in the West to have some semblance of freedom.
[03:01:03.559 --> 03:01:05.340]  We give up on them, we give up on ourselves.
[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:07.421]  Matt Bracken's taken over.
[03:01:07.481 --> 03:01:14.604]  You know, we had this amazing World War II vet that I had a chance to meet four or five years ago at an event that I then got our crew to interview a few times.
[03:01:15.145 --> 03:01:18.506]  He's dead, Richard Overton, but just a really interesting, smart guy.
[03:01:19.126 --> 03:01:20.707]  Let's look at the negative end of this.
[03:01:20.767 --> 03:01:22.268]  Some spoiled, rotten man
[03:01:24.028 --> 03:01:25.989]  Running around screaming at people in a business.
[03:01:26.029 --> 03:01:27.530]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:01:28.050 --> 03:01:29.431]  A Paul Joseph Watson article.
[03:01:30.071 --> 03:01:32.352]  Throwing a fit because somebody misidentifies them.
[03:01:32.913 --> 03:01:35.434]  And, you know, whether they got a wee-wee or a pee-pee.
[03:01:36.435 --> 03:01:37.155]  This is video.
[03:01:37.195 --> 03:01:40.197]  Transgender goes nuts in store after being misgendered.
[03:01:40.637 --> 03:01:43.678]  California, it's a crime to misgender somebody.
[03:01:44.379 --> 03:01:46.960]  So you got two million people in slave camps in China.
[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:49.942]  You got the whole world government breaking loose on us.
[03:01:51.499 --> 03:02:03.366]  Millions dying of flesh-eating bacteria, and everybody's got to kiss the ass of, you know, people that want to say, like, I don't give a flying, you know what, if you think you're a woman, a man, a polka-dotted Easter bunny.
[03:02:03.987 --> 03:02:06.148]  But it doesn't mean I got to kiss your ass all day.
[03:02:06.168 --> 03:02:08.789]  And they take our openness as this.
[03:02:09.090 --> 03:02:09.470]  Here it is.
[03:02:13.832 --> 03:02:16.815]  Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.
[03:02:16.835 --> 03:02:17.816]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:02:17.836 --> 03:02:18.837]  It is ma'am.
[03:02:18.897 --> 03:02:21.480]  I can call the police if you'd like me to.
[03:02:21.580 --> 03:02:23.142]  You need to settle down.
[03:02:23.282 --> 03:02:24.243]  Oh, hit pause again.
[03:02:24.263 --> 03:02:27.847]  I want to restart this because we had trouble with the computer.
[03:02:28.407 --> 03:02:33.152]  I mean, this guy looks, let's back it up, this guy looks like Hulk Hogan.
[03:02:33.773 --> 03:02:36.575]  Now Hulk Hogan had long hair, but it's dude.
[03:02:38.348 --> 03:02:42.352]  So, it's like Police Academy where they got beards, you know, and they're doing the stakeout on hookers.
[03:02:42.992 --> 03:02:45.074]  I mean, dude, you got big wide shoulders.
[03:02:45.094 --> 03:02:50.920]  It's like the transgender guy comes in and, you know, they fired the nurse and he says, listen, I want a pap smear.
[03:02:51.581 --> 03:02:56.505]  And she says, listen, you got an anaconda in your pants.
[03:02:57.887 --> 03:03:00.669]  And they said, listen, you do the pap smear, you give in to the mental illness.
[03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.750]  Here, I'm sorry.
[03:03:02.171 --> 03:03:02.951]  Let's go back to it.
[03:03:02.991 --> 03:03:03.272]  Here it is.
[03:03:04.019 --> 03:03:05.180]  We're not doing credit.
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:06.521]  Excuse me, sir.
[03:03:06.561 --> 03:03:09.683]  There's a young man in here.
[03:03:09.763 --> 03:03:11.464]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:03:11.645 --> 03:03:13.966]  It is ma'am.
[03:03:14.106 --> 03:03:15.107]  God, the mental illness.
[03:03:15.387 --> 03:03:17.909]  You need to settle down and mind your business, okay?
[03:03:18.249 --> 03:03:18.670]  Ma'am.
[03:03:18.990 --> 03:03:20.511]  Big-ass bully, ma'am.
[03:03:20.731 --> 03:03:22.372]  No, you said sir.
[03:03:22.953 --> 03:03:23.853]  Once again, it's ma'am.
[03:03:24.014 --> 03:03:26.075]  I said both of you guys, Mr. General.
[03:03:26.095 --> 03:03:28.197]  Right beforehand, you f****** said sir.
[03:03:29.281 --> 03:03:29.981]  God, these people.
[03:03:30.041 --> 03:03:33.083]  Take it outside if you want to call me sir!
[03:03:33.143 --> 03:03:35.164]  Take it outside, bitch!
[03:03:35.184 --> 03:03:35.884]  Let's go!
[03:03:35.904 --> 03:03:38.806]  I'll kick some stuff down.
[03:03:38.866 --> 03:03:40.567]  I wish that woman touches me.
[03:03:40.607 --> 03:03:41.487]  Get clapped!
[03:03:41.507 --> 03:03:42.588]  I need your corporate number!
[03:03:43.028 --> 03:03:46.550]  Because I'm going to talk to all of your friends.
[03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:47.631]  I'm a woman!
[03:03:47.651 --> 03:03:49.872]  I need your corporate number now!
[03:03:49.992 --> 03:03:51.333]  Pay for my sex change!
[03:03:52.633 --> 03:03:53.774]  Get it for me now!
[03:03:53.794 --> 03:03:54.634]  Get it for me now!
[03:03:57.145 --> 03:03:58.708]  I'm a six foot three woman!
[03:03:58.729 --> 03:04:00.412]  I'm gonna beat your ass!
[03:04:00.452 --> 03:04:01.614]  Stop calling me a man!
[03:04:01.875 --> 03:04:03.318]  Because quite clearly I am not!
[03:04:03.538 --> 03:04:05.122]  So what you are is a mental patient.
[03:04:08.990 --> 03:04:16.215]  That is a nice purse he's got.
[03:04:16.676 --> 03:04:18.117]  He's so special.
[03:04:18.177 --> 03:04:19.178]  Oh my God!
[03:04:19.578 --> 03:04:21.799]  You're some clerk at a place and I look like a man.
[03:04:21.819 --> 03:04:24.562]  I got a giant head and a big ol' brow ridges.
[03:04:24.602 --> 03:04:27.003]  And you know, it's a blonde haired dude.
[03:04:27.023 --> 03:04:29.465]  And you, I, you are bad!
[03:04:29.705 --> 03:04:30.586]  I am God!
[03:04:30.686 --> 03:04:32.988]  The entire LGBTQ community!
[03:04:33.048 --> 03:04:34.609]  The entire LGBTQ community!
[03:04:36.365 --> 03:04:41.306]  That says our kids belong to them!
[03:04:41.426 --> 03:04:46.787]  I'm gonna call the entire LGBT community!
[03:04:47.787 --> 03:04:49.008]  I'm marching here!
[03:04:49.028 --> 03:04:52.348]  I'm gonna beat your ass!
[03:04:53.248 --> 03:04:54.249]  I'm a woman!
[03:04:54.929 --> 03:04:55.969]  Don't you see it?! !
[03:05:03.615 --> 03:05:04.756]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:05:05.277 --> 03:05:06.438]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:06.998 --> 03:05:08.059]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:05:08.520 --> 03:05:09.621]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:10.562 --> 03:05:14.806]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:15.466 --> 03:05:18.669]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:19.270 --> 03:05:27.337]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.258 --> 03:05:37.621]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:05:38.301 --> 03:05:42.203]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:05:42.263 --> 03:05:48.164]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:05:48.225 --> 03:05:51.045]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:05:51.245 --> 03:05:52.486]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:52.746 --> 03:05:55.767]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:05:58.399 --> 03:06:05.745]  So, I don't want to say 9 times out of 10 because that would be lying.
[03:06:26.929 --> 03:06:44.023]  It was a couple weeks ago, I spent a couple hours of time I shouldn't have trying to find a cross-burning, a poop swastika, an N-words get-out, a Jewish temple, tombstones knocked over that was real.
[03:06:44.403 --> 03:06:50.027]  And I found one, the despicable Pittsburgh shooting that we decried.
[03:06:50.528 --> 03:06:51.549]  But that's it.
[03:06:52.269 --> 03:06:53.330]  And I mean, thank God.
[03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:54.271]  I wish there were none.
[03:06:58.155 --> 03:07:09.500]  But then it begins to come out that, remember, Michael Moore, after Trump was elected, was part of a couple thousand people at Trump Tower in New York who went there because of a Russian bot.
[03:07:10.381 --> 03:07:14.863]  An actual Russian company was hired by Democrats, because you can hire British companies or Russian companies.
[03:07:14.883 --> 03:07:16.263]  And let's say it, Russia's wide open.
[03:07:16.303 --> 03:07:20.345]  You can hire Russian companies to do any damn thing you want.
[03:07:20.365 --> 03:07:21.866]  You can hire Nigerian ones, too.
[03:07:22.326 --> 03:07:23.067]  You can hire U.S.
[03:07:23.127 --> 03:07:23.607]  companies, too.
[03:07:25.501 --> 03:07:27.883]  I mean, Russia does a lot of online chicanery.
[03:07:30.245 --> 03:07:34.248]  And so, they were doing it during the Roy Moore fiasco.
[03:07:35.949 --> 03:07:39.812]  And remember, oh my God, the Russian bots were promoting Roy Moore.
[03:07:39.852 --> 03:07:41.153]  They were doing it really obvious.
[03:07:41.473 --> 03:07:44.055]  The time I said, you can pull it up, I said, this is fake.
[03:07:46.294 --> 03:07:49.516]  You know, stuff like, Putin appreciate Roy Moore.
[03:07:49.596 --> 03:07:50.897]  Good job, Roy Moore.
[03:07:50.997 --> 03:07:51.998]  Oh yes, oh good.
[03:07:52.358 --> 03:07:54.339]  We get you fur cap in Moscow.
[03:07:54.439 --> 03:07:56.201]  I mean, it was redonkulous.
[03:07:56.641 --> 03:08:02.265]  Leading back to Facebook pages with Russians going, Comrade Moore, you good for us.
[03:08:02.385 --> 03:08:04.966]  I mean, do you really think that's real?
[03:08:06.167 --> 03:08:08.749]  It's the Chai Coms putting chips in all your stuff, not the Russians.
[03:08:09.109 --> 03:08:10.850]  If the Russians did this, I'd be against them.
[03:08:11.231 --> 03:08:14.333]  You think I got some sycophantic love affair with the Russkies?
[03:08:15.865 --> 03:08:18.468]  Well, we reported this days ago, but now Fox News is reporting it.
[03:08:26.696 --> 03:08:40.103]  A cyber security company that participated in the disinformation campaign against the Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate race reportedly pinned a Senate report touted as a bombshell about Russia's social media operations in the 2016 presidential election.
[03:08:40.624 --> 03:08:50.189]  New Knowledge's leading firm on Russian-related cyber issues was one of two firms whose report on Russia activities during the presidential election was published by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:08:51.397 --> 03:08:53.118]  And they even talked about me in there with no proof.
[03:08:53.759 --> 03:09:03.846]  Turns out it was Democrats funding private companies in Russia, they're just PR firms, to then run the ads for Roy Moore.
[03:09:05.507 --> 03:09:06.568]  The scale was massive.
[03:09:06.608 --> 03:09:19.558]  New knowledge researchers wrote of Russian disinformation, with the alleged campaign reaching 1.26 million people on Facebook, posting 10.4 million tweets on Twitter, uploading 1,000 videos of YouTube, and reaching over 20 million users on Instagram.
[03:09:21.578 --> 03:09:23.659]  But it turns out it was all staged by the Democrats.
[03:09:25.019 --> 03:09:28.300]  So, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, best-selling author.
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:38.144]  He joins us to take over for the hour, but the time I have left with him... What do you make of the current time-space, or battle-space we're in?
[03:09:38.184 --> 03:09:38.504]  Because...
[03:09:39.437 --> 03:09:41.459]  Clearly Trump is operating on his own now.
[03:09:41.500 --> 03:09:45.024]  He's getting rid of the people that were compromised, that were double agents.
[03:09:45.224 --> 03:09:50.710]  I even had sources, high level, they got very threatening two weeks before he started firing people.
[03:09:51.091 --> 03:09:54.935]  They already knew it was coming and I was basically told, you better roll over against Trump.
[03:09:54.976 --> 03:09:55.776]  I'm not going to do it.
[03:09:56.875 --> 03:10:00.978]  Um, because I think Trump's the best in the country, obviously at hand here.
[03:10:01.038 --> 03:10:09.604]  But let's just say the battle, Matt Bracken, is now joined and with him moving and even CNN saying, oh my God, he's following his instincts.
[03:10:10.244 --> 03:10:15.228]  And you've got Giuliani saying, obviously investigate, don't investigate, indict!
[03:10:15.548 --> 03:10:23.253]  Get a grand jury and panel on Robert Mueller for destroying tens of thousands of emails and being the mule for Uranium One.
[03:10:23.334 --> 03:10:25.075]  I mean, now is the time of offense.
[03:10:25.575 --> 03:10:33.477]  Not just on censorship, not just on China, but every indicator we see now, and other sources I have, say that Trump is about to move.
[03:10:33.897 --> 03:10:35.037]  So what does that signify?
[03:10:35.057 --> 03:10:35.997]  Do you agree, A.B.?
[03:10:36.398 --> 03:10:39.858]  And then the next, how will the globalists counter-strike?
[03:10:40.118 --> 03:10:42.339]  Mack Bracken of EnemiesFarAndDomestic.com.
[03:10:43.959 --> 03:10:45.580]  Well, the battle goes on.
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:54.942]  Every time that I read or hear that Mueller's probe is about to wind up, I just roll my eyes, because Mueller's never going to go away.
[03:10:55.817 --> 03:11:03.788]  As long as Trump is president, there's going to be... Sure, he's using that as the feeder to get stuff outside of the law to feed to the Democrats in their 80 investigations.
[03:11:05.249 --> 03:11:06.491]  Well, he's the shield.
[03:11:06.531 --> 03:11:14.101]  He's the sword and shield of the, you know, the Deep State, Uranium One, you know, all going back to Benghazi and Uranium One and even further than that.
[03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:24.164]  As long as there's an ongoing investigation, that gives the corrupt deep staters that are still running the DOJ cover to say, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. President.
[03:11:24.605 --> 03:11:27.149]  We just can't give you that unredacted information.
[03:11:27.896 --> 03:11:32.737]  So we're in a battle of parallel narratives, you know, that are hermetically sealed parallel narratives.
[03:11:32.757 --> 03:11:36.979]  And that's why they want InfoWars and you off the air, because they're getting ready to make their big move.
[03:11:36.999 --> 03:11:37.899]  That's what let's just understand.
[03:11:37.979 --> 03:11:38.799]  This is the fight now.
[03:11:39.079 --> 03:11:45.441]  When they magnify what we say, when they cut up the clips and get them out, when they email their friends and family, when they word of mouth, that's the power.
[03:11:45.481 --> 03:11:47.501]  They want us shut down ahead of the big event.
[03:11:49.122 --> 03:11:51.422]  Well, and I think that, yeah, for sure.
[03:11:51.662 --> 03:11:57.064]  And I think that we've only got a couple weeks until the Democrat Congress is installed.
[03:11:57.797 --> 03:12:00.218]  And in the meantime... No, let's be clear.
[03:12:00.278 --> 03:12:01.118]  We have six days.
[03:12:02.279 --> 03:12:02.519]  Right.
[03:12:02.719 --> 03:12:03.299]  Yeah, days.
[03:12:03.879 --> 03:12:07.001]  And so this is a huge poker game going on.
[03:12:07.061 --> 03:12:10.542]  It's like two guys in a swimming pool doing a breath-holding contest.
[03:12:11.178 --> 03:12:15.363]  But the people that are going to suffer are obviously, you know, the president.
[03:12:15.383 --> 03:12:15.944]  He's fine.
[03:12:16.544 --> 03:12:19.808]  And these wealthy millionaire deep state guys, they're fine.
[03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:22.632]  So they're putting pressure on their minions.
[03:12:23.132 --> 03:12:28.719]  They're basically, you know, saying to the federal employees that are out of work, we're using you as pawns.
[03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:36.664]  Meanwhile, we're ringing the bell in Central America saying, come to America with a kid and you'll get straight to a hospital.
[03:12:36.684 --> 03:12:39.325]  Yeah, they're trying to weigh down our borders and collapse our sovereignty.
[03:12:39.626 --> 03:12:43.788]  This nation is literally at war by traitors inside and without.
[03:12:43.808 --> 03:12:46.550]  And that's my point is, I don't want COG to be implemented.
[03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:47.510]  I don't want martial law.
[03:12:47.570 --> 03:12:51.153]  I'm the guy that's against all that when the Democrats want it, or bad Republicans.
[03:12:51.193 --> 03:12:53.294]  But they're bringing us to the crisis, Matt.
[03:12:53.734 --> 03:12:56.156]  And at a certain point, it becomes dereliction of duty if we don't
[03:12:56.676 --> 03:13:00.658]  Tell the president, in our own words, sir, you're greenlighted to do whatever you have to.
[03:13:02.299 --> 03:13:04.740]  Well, and so far he is holding strong.
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:12.864]  I mean, like, for example, you know, not folding on the border, although I think that 5 billion, I don't know where that number ever came from.
[03:13:12.904 --> 03:13:15.326]  I think he should have just stuck with 25 billion.
[03:13:15.446 --> 03:13:17.067]  Let me ask you this and let you take over.
[03:13:18.047 --> 03:13:19.529]  How do we greenlight the President?
[03:13:19.549 --> 03:13:22.933]  Because he's looking for our approval, not out of some wimpiness.
[03:13:22.973 --> 03:13:25.275]  He wants to know, do we have the stomach for this?
[03:13:25.315 --> 03:13:31.382]  I mean, we're facing CHICOM-funded collapse of our border, with a bunch of traders trying to collapse our stock market.
[03:13:31.442 --> 03:13:35.226]  So, I'm not the one looking for, you know, obviously it makes me a target to call for this.
[03:13:35.586 --> 03:13:38.870]  I'm just saying, either we either just give up, or we go to the next level.
[03:13:40.595 --> 03:13:50.385]  Well, I wish that he would fly Air Force One to Fort Huachuca, then take the choppers down to the border, where it only looks like a cattle fence.
[03:13:50.405 --> 03:13:55.691]  You know, it's three strands of rusty barbed wire separating Mexico from America.
[03:13:56.031 --> 03:14:02.377]  They keep showing San Diego or El Paso, places where there is a wall, but half of the border is made to just walk over.
[03:14:03.410 --> 03:14:04.591]  Yeah, this is Cloward Piven on steroids.
[03:14:04.631 --> 03:14:06.932]  This is, you know, endgame of Cloward Piven.
[03:14:06.972 --> 03:14:08.813]  For people that aren't familiar, you know, it's basically
[03:14:28.306 --> 03:14:34.791]  Crush a capitalist society by open borders and massive welfare until it becomes Venezuela.
[03:14:35.211 --> 03:14:40.414]  People have to remember, you know, the deep state elites, they don't care if it turns into Venezuela.
[03:14:40.454 --> 03:14:42.816]  Venezuela's great if your name is Chavez or Maduro.
[03:14:42.856 --> 03:14:44.037]  No, they get off on that.
[03:14:44.717 --> 03:14:45.818]  They consolidate control.
[03:14:45.858 --> 03:14:46.659]  They're a bunch of jerks.
[03:14:48.197 --> 03:14:48.417]  Right.
[03:14:48.497 --> 03:14:54.901]  Then they live in a castle and everybody else is a slave living out in, you know, in Mad Max shantytowns.
[03:14:55.441 --> 03:14:57.523]  But that's fine if you're still in the castle.
[03:14:58.063 --> 03:14:59.444]  So that's what we're watching.
[03:14:59.544 --> 03:15:04.647]  And it's really a question of waking people up to this, red-pilling people.
[03:15:04.667 --> 03:15:12.171]  All right, you're taking over, but just bottom line, how pathetic is the left, not joining the president trying to secure the country?
[03:15:12.211 --> 03:15:14.433]  I mean, it's so clear they should join us.
[03:15:16.024 --> 03:15:18.367]  Yeah, well, I mean, this is a golden opportunity.
[03:15:18.467 --> 03:15:33.326]  I think that with the police officer shot out in California and the border still wide open and more caravans forming up in Honduras, I think the president should take this show on the road, go down to the border where it's actually, you know, wide open
[03:15:33.846 --> 03:15:36.367]  And people need to understand, the fence is about to... No, I agree.
[03:15:36.387 --> 03:15:37.867]  That's the smartest thing you ever said.
[03:15:38.247 --> 03:15:41.448]  The president should encamp on the border where we're under attack.
[03:15:41.648 --> 03:15:47.290]  America... because I've got all the articles, vetoes like, we've got thousands being released today, the border's open, come to America!
[03:15:47.490 --> 03:15:48.210]  Collapse it!
[03:15:48.270 --> 03:15:48.590]  Yay!
[03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:49.431]  America sucks!
[03:15:49.691 --> 03:15:50.511]  Piss all over it!
[03:15:50.551 --> 03:15:50.931]  Hold on!
[03:15:50.971 --> 03:15:51.371]  Yes!
[03:15:51.931 --> 03:15:57.453]  Folks, Matt Bracken takes over in the war room in about 45 minutes in fullwars.com forward slash show.
[03:15:57.813 --> 03:15:59.954]  If you don't spread the links, the globalists win!
[03:16:00.214 --> 03:16:01.094]  Spread the links!
[03:16:04.175 --> 03:16:06.276]  We've done incredible things in our time.
[03:16:06.897 --> 03:16:08.518]  All of us in the Infowars community.
[03:16:08.538 --> 03:16:11.700]  And that's why we're the number one target by tyrants worldwide.
[03:16:12.561 --> 03:16:15.162]  And we could revel in our time, what we've already done.
[03:16:16.263 --> 03:16:19.605]  But the real battle for the future of civilization is just now heating up.
[03:16:20.486 --> 03:16:23.888]  That's why the censorship and the demonization and the tyranny is out in the open.
[03:16:24.809 --> 03:16:26.230]  Because the controllers are scared.
[03:16:27.435 --> 03:16:33.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare to close out 2018, I cannot stress on you enough how I want to salute you.
[03:16:34.321 --> 03:16:36.762]  I cannot stress enough how much I want to thank you.
[03:16:37.343 --> 03:16:40.465]  I cannot stress enough how epic this battle is.
[03:16:41.026 --> 03:16:48.071]  The globalists literally want to capture all of civilization, all the life process, not just of humans, but of plants and animals.
[03:16:48.792 --> 03:16:50.033]  They want to be God.
[03:16:50.133 --> 03:16:51.273]  They want to play God.
[03:16:51.614 --> 03:16:54.415]  They want to be omnipresent and surveil everything we do.
[03:16:54.735 --> 03:16:58.777]  They want us to take microchips and digital barcodes to buy and sell.
[03:17:00.158 --> 03:17:06.722]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[03:17:08.291 --> 03:17:29.139]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:17:30.499 --> 03:17:34.661]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[03:17:35.595 --> 03:17:39.017]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[03:17:39.257 --> 03:17:41.258]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:17:41.938 --> 03:17:44.619]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:46.560]  2018 has been insane.
[03:17:46.580 --> 03:17:53.044]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:17:53.924 --> 03:17:57.586]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:17:57.606 --> 03:18:01.688]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[03:18:02.958 --> 03:18:04.840]  Most people have heard of the Streisand effect.
[03:18:04.860 --> 03:18:12.386]  It was probably 10 years ago or more that Barbara Streisand had this huge mansion on the edge of the ocean.
[03:18:13.307 --> 03:18:14.788]  And somebody had just reported about it.
[03:18:15.669 --> 03:18:18.011]  And so she tried to have them basically shut down.
[03:18:18.371 --> 03:18:21.414]  And that drew a million times more attention to it all.
[03:18:22.054 --> 03:18:31.498]  But the social engineers, because I read about it in the news, they actually openly talk about how to censor conservatives and nationalists, and how to make sure people don't care about them.
[03:18:31.778 --> 03:18:36.180]  And they say, well, as long as we censor a lot of them at one time, it won't matter.
[03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:39.722]  And they'll give it more attention at first, but then later everybody will forget about it.
[03:18:39.802 --> 03:18:41.282]  Because the public's dumb and doesn't have a memory.
[03:18:41.643 --> 03:18:44.504]  They're betting on you not valuing information.
[03:18:44.824 --> 03:18:46.885]  And there are thousands of channels out there, tens of thousands.
[03:18:47.637 --> 03:18:53.702]  But InfoWars is what they've targeted particularly because we've got their number and we know about their criminal plans.
[03:18:54.223 --> 03:18:59.588]  So of all the ways you can spread the word about InfoWars, the newest and one of the coolest is hiding in plain view.
[03:18:59.748 --> 03:19:00.849]  But why did I think of this?
[03:19:01.269 --> 03:19:02.170]  Text the word NEWS
[03:19:03.411 --> 03:19:04.471]  To the number 3-3-2-2-2.
[03:19:04.491 --> 03:19:15.675]  And we will send you one alert a day of the most important breaking news for you to hopefully spread, everybody you know, to cause that chain reaction of communication they fear so much.
[03:19:15.695 --> 03:19:27.039]  And if you want to get live breaking news feeds, when it's not just my main show every day, but emergency live reports we do almost every day, when we do those, we will send you a text that we're going live.
[03:19:27.139 --> 03:19:28.179]  Hopefully you'll spread it.
[03:19:28.379 --> 03:19:29.179]  That's what's really key.
[03:19:29.679 --> 03:19:30.380]  Text the word SHOW
[03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:32.220]  To the number 3-3-2-2-2.
[03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:36.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, nothing can stop you when you take action.
[03:19:37.321 --> 03:19:39.282]  Nothing can stop you when you resist the globalists.
[03:19:39.822 --> 03:19:43.583]  They are counting on you being weak, and having no memory, and not taking action.
[03:19:44.043 --> 03:19:50.164]  When you make it fun to fight these bastards, and realize it's an info war, you're unstoppable, and we will defeat these people.
[03:19:50.585 --> 03:19:52.505]  Everything is now in your hands.
[03:19:53.025 --> 03:19:56.526]  Text to those numbers, and spread those links, and we will win.
[03:20:06.246 --> 03:20:08.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.568 --> 03:20:18.632]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:18.672 --> 03:20:20.233]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:20:20.413 --> 03:20:25.396]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:38.448 --> 03:20:42.849]  Okay, Matt Bracken here for the last hour here on Monday between the holidays.
[03:20:42.869 --> 03:20:45.410]  This is kind of off week.
[03:20:45.610 --> 03:20:58.274]  Everybody's taking stock, looking back at 2018, lessons learned, looking ahead to 2019, what's going to be better, what's going to be worse, personally, nationally, politically, everything.
[03:21:00.295 --> 03:21:02.115]  For show prep, I usually watch the show.
[03:21:02.536 --> 03:21:03.636]  I figure that's a good idea.
[03:21:04.326 --> 03:21:13.453]  And I was I was really I was watching the the the discussion with Peter Schiff really closely and a lot of what he said.
[03:21:14.273 --> 03:21:16.755]  We're talking about cryptocurrencies and so forth.
[03:21:16.795 --> 03:21:23.880]  But at the macro level, I think that he he and I see is exactly what's happening in terms of cycles.
[03:21:25.161 --> 03:21:30.605]  I think that we are going to have a recession and Trump is going to take the full blame for it.
[03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:36.083]  This is going to set up a socialist coming in in 2020, just as Peter Schiff said.
[03:21:36.704 --> 03:21:57.638]  Anybody that didn't see that hour, it would really be great to go back and listen to the podcast or watch the show, especially like the last 10 or 15 minutes, because I think that Schiff's, what do you call it, the ball, the crystal ball, I think it's in pretty clear focus there.
[03:21:58.683 --> 03:22:02.866]  That discussion with Alex was just pure gold, so to speak.
[03:22:03.766 --> 03:22:08.029]  And, you know, I was really thinking that that was dead on.
[03:22:09.329 --> 03:22:18.935]  Right in the last segment, Alex was talking about Judge Roy Moore and the fake Russian bots used to basically trash Roy Moore.
[03:22:20.007 --> 03:22:33.953]  And I had the idea back then during the during the Kavanaugh hearings that Roy Moore was really a rollout for the strategy that they tried to apply to Kavanaugh, you know, with bringing out the babes.
[03:22:34.033 --> 03:22:39.395]  If one of them has any credibility, then anybody can make any charge.
[03:22:39.615 --> 03:22:42.656]  And they just become it just becomes a pig pile.
[03:22:43.377 --> 03:22:48.739]  And there's no way to get out of it in the limited time at the end of a of a of a campaign.
[03:22:49.571 --> 03:22:53.381]  And this was exactly what they tried to do against Judge Kavanaugh.
[03:22:53.963 --> 03:22:56.550]  And fortunately, he was able to actually fight his way back.
[03:22:56.951 --> 03:22:58.354]  You know, local Alabama race.
[03:22:59.239 --> 03:23:01.601]  The National Party wasn't interested in helping him.
[03:23:01.661 --> 03:23:03.882]  Nobody came to Roy Moore's defense.
[03:23:04.302 --> 03:23:06.484]  But have you noticed that those women all disappeared?
[03:23:07.044 --> 03:23:09.846]  The ones that were, you know, claiming all the things about Roy Moore.
[03:23:10.546 --> 03:23:11.847]  Now, I don't know the man.
[03:23:11.867 --> 03:23:13.268]  I wasn't there.
[03:23:13.808 --> 03:23:22.394]  But it seems like there are a lot of parallels between those two cases of using old allegations as a strategy to take somebody out.
[03:23:23.374 --> 03:23:27.417]  But, you know, we're going to so we just need to look in the look to the future now.
[03:23:28.675 --> 03:23:31.738]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, obviously she's on life support.
[03:23:32.899 --> 03:23:34.981]  I don't know how long she's going to be able to hang in there.
[03:23:35.542 --> 03:23:43.129]  But this is one of the big cards that's going to be played when she finally can't be dragged on a stretcher to the Supreme Court.
[03:23:43.789 --> 03:23:44.990]  When she finally flatlines.
[03:23:47.569 --> 03:23:54.615]  The Democrats are going to go absolutely crazy because they think that they've turned the tide against Trumpism.
[03:23:55.136 --> 03:24:02.422]  That with the Congress coming in, they're going to be able to move forward with all these investigations and try to impeach him.
[03:24:02.943 --> 03:24:12.892]  Whether they succeed in impeaching him and kicking him out or just crippling him the way that Bill Clinton was impeached but not removed by the Senate.
[03:24:14.127 --> 03:24:19.448]  They figure he'll be he'll be a hamstrung lame duck through to 2020.
[03:24:20.228 --> 03:24:31.611]  With the economy, the bubble popping and we're probably going to see in a wild swings in the stock market, but trending massively down because I think Schiff is right.
[03:24:32.171 --> 03:24:35.271]  You know, and some things you just can't blame on the president.
[03:24:35.712 --> 03:24:42.533]  But as Schiff said, the president, I think, made a mistake by claiming a lot of the credit for just, you know,
[03:24:43.562 --> 03:24:45.703]  International business cycles that are happening.
[03:24:46.223 --> 03:24:55.767]  If you're claiming credit for the ride up, then you're going to take the blame on the ride down because they're going to be able to keep quoting all of his, you know, I'm responsible for the economy.
[03:24:56.207 --> 03:24:56.927]  Isn't it great?
[03:24:57.387 --> 03:25:01.869]  So when the economy tanks, this is going to be used as ammunition against him.
[03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:05.471]  So I think that's going to weigh heavily against him in 2020.
[03:25:06.949 --> 03:25:29.228]  Then we get a Kamala Harris or a Bernie Sanders for four years at least as president, and they're going to, like FDR did after the stock market crashed in 1929 with Herbert Hoover, they're going to think that accelerating socialism is the way to fix it, and all it's going to do is lead us into a Great Depression.
[03:25:29.829 --> 03:25:33.392]  But unlike the 1930s, where there was a level of social cohesion,
[03:25:34.136 --> 03:25:37.521]  No, I'm not saying that America was all it was, you know, a social utopia.
[03:25:38.182 --> 03:25:44.231]  But even even, you know, given Jim Crow laws and so forth, there is a social stability.
[03:25:45.054 --> 03:25:46.815]  There was no EBT system.
[03:25:47.075 --> 03:25:59.498]  There weren't people with the short attention spans driven by video games and smartphones that when things turn really ugly, they're going to turn to looting the way that they never did in the 1930s.
[03:25:59.598 --> 03:26:09.701]  So where I would differ from Schiff, Schiff thinks that 19 the 2024 will be the big chance for our last chance to pull back with a conservative president.
[03:26:10.376 --> 03:26:22.402]  But I think that four years of a Bernie Sanders or a Kamala Harris is going to result in Venezuela conditions leading to anarchy, looting and civil war.
[03:26:22.963 --> 03:26:30.707]  So in a sense, I'm unfortunately feeling that Trump is more of a reprieve than a salvation.
[03:26:31.428 --> 03:26:37.570]  I think that the Titanic has hit the iceberg and changing captains at this point.
[03:26:38.611 --> 03:26:48.914]  It's like focusing in on the bridge of the Titanic and arguing about which captain's going to be in control for the next hour when the ship's taken on water the whole time.
[03:26:49.535 --> 03:26:51.275]  And that's where I do agree with Schiff.
[03:26:51.836 --> 03:26:56.197]  And no matter who is the president, these trends are going to continue.
[03:26:56.757 --> 03:26:58.258]  If it's Trump, he'll be blamed.
[03:26:58.938 --> 03:27:05.603]  Then they're going to turn on the socialist jets after Trump and drive it straight into the ground.
[03:27:06.244 --> 03:27:08.986]  That's unfortunately what I think is going to happen.
[03:27:10.387 --> 03:27:15.050]  Maybe not the next segment, because I have some other things on my mind, but we're going to be taking calls.
[03:27:15.691 --> 03:27:16.992]  So the call-in numbers are 877-789-2539.
[03:27:17.152 --> 03:27:17.472]  That's 789-ALEX.
[03:27:24.886 --> 03:27:27.107]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:27:27.688 --> 03:27:31.671]  And we'll be taking calls maybe after the bottom of the hour or coming up to the end.
[03:27:32.532 --> 03:27:41.219]  But the next segment I've got another subject to switch over to, a couple more subjects, and I'll maybe tease them a little bit here.
[03:27:41.339 --> 03:27:47.704]  You might notice I'm kind of a gold bug myself, like Chef, and I'm wearing something new today.
[03:27:48.573 --> 03:28:02.469]  There's a really awesome website that I've been going to forever and it's more than a website because the guy's like a nexus with translators that he puts subtitles on videos like in the same news cycle.
[03:28:04.631 --> 03:28:08.613]  It's no good if you subtitle a foreign video that's two or three weeks old.
[03:28:09.113 --> 03:28:23.901]  If you can do it in that 24-48 hour period when it's still newsworthy, like say, the beheadings in Morocco, and you subtitle and translate Italian, German, Swedish videos, it's really important for our cause.
[03:28:24.522 --> 03:28:28.844]  And that website is VladTest.com, and I've been
[03:28:29.712 --> 03:28:32.902]  Looking for a long time for a symbol for the resistance.
[03:28:33.585 --> 03:28:35.190]  A symbol for the dissident right.
[03:28:35.371 --> 03:28:36.534]  For the counter-jihad.
[03:28:37.199 --> 03:28:42.303]  And this was Vlad's idea for a long time, and I'm going to talk about that in the next segment.
[03:28:42.944 --> 03:28:48.749]  A symbol for the resistance, the counter-jihad, alt-right, dissident-right.
[03:28:49.289 --> 03:28:50.470]  And we'll be back in a little bit.
[03:28:50.530 --> 03:28:55.755]  We'll talk about that, and then we'll be taking your calls maybe at the end of this segment or the next segment.
[03:28:56.235 --> 03:29:00.659]  So I'm Matt Bracken, and we'll be right back on the other side of these commercial spots.
[03:29:04.349 --> 03:29:06.190]  We're ending the year.
[03:29:06.570 --> 03:29:07.550]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:08.551]  It's been an insane year.
[03:29:09.851 --> 03:29:17.434]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[03:29:18.515 --> 03:29:29.459]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[03:29:30.499 --> 03:29:31.300]  And that the globalists
[03:29:32.421 --> 03:29:38.665]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[03:29:38.685 --> 03:29:44.149]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[03:29:44.689 --> 03:29:46.810]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[03:29:47.151 --> 03:29:49.132]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[03:29:50.793 --> 03:29:52.674]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[03:29:52.694 --> 03:29:55.076]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[03:29:55.936 --> 03:29:58.538]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[03:29:59.919 --> 03:30:01.320]  But our aircraft didn't have
[03:30:02.984 --> 03:30:05.225]  Radar.
[03:30:05.385 --> 03:30:16.512]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[03:30:16.712 --> 03:30:28.139]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[03:30:28.299 --> 03:30:30.260]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:34.321]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[03:30:35.221 --> 03:30:42.424]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[03:30:42.444 --> 03:30:48.465]  Because we're shelling Germans, paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[03:30:48.866 --> 03:30:51.166]  That's a separate battle.
[03:30:52.607 --> 03:30:52.987]  And so...
[03:30:55.168 --> 03:30:59.931]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[03:31:00.411 --> 03:31:03.193]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[03:31:04.073 --> 03:31:09.457]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[03:31:10.317 --> 03:31:17.922]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[03:31:19.844 --> 03:31:23.505]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[03:31:24.326 --> 03:31:30.188]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[03:31:30.228 --> 03:31:34.110]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[03:31:35.094 --> 03:31:44.020]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[03:31:44.440 --> 03:31:57.428]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[03:31:57.649 --> 03:31:59.370]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[03:32:00.362 --> 03:32:08.646]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[03:32:09.346 --> 03:32:14.568]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[03:32:15.068 --> 03:32:18.550]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job, too.
[03:32:19.310 --> 03:32:26.654]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[03:32:27.114 --> 03:32:29.295]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[03:32:30.015 --> 03:32:32.398]  Until the end of this year.
[03:32:33.259 --> 03:32:41.409]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[03:32:42.449 --> 03:32:45.111]  And of course, so many other great items.
[03:32:45.151 --> 03:32:50.917]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[03:32:50.957 --> 03:32:55.220]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[03:32:55.561 --> 03:32:56.622]  A true 360 win.
[03:32:57.022 --> 03:32:58.483]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:58.663 --> 03:33:00.365]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:08.752]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.814 --> 03:33:29.095]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.635 --> 03:33:33.156]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:37.017 --> 03:33:49.359]  Okay, at the end of the last segment, I was talking about this cross around my neck, and you might notice something a little bit unusual about it, in that it's not completely symmetrical on all four sides.
[03:33:50.575 --> 03:33:53.338]  It's actually got a sharp point at the bottom.
[03:33:54.078 --> 03:34:01.646]  And the point of this, literally, is that it's a cross, but it also symbolizes armed resistance.
[03:34:01.906 --> 03:34:02.566]  It's a weapon.
[03:34:03.607 --> 03:34:08.252]  And this is something that I really hadn't been aware of.
[03:34:08.292 --> 03:34:14.498]  I know some history of Spain, but I didn't understand the significance of this cross.
[03:34:15.499 --> 03:34:15.619]  Now,
[03:34:16.801 --> 03:34:30.167]  The Muslims, the Arabs invaded Spain in the early 700s, and in no time at all, they conquered almost all of Spain, except for a little sliver there in the north.
[03:34:30.907 --> 03:34:37.170]  So 95% of Spain was under firm Muslim control very quickly.
[03:34:38.390 --> 03:34:45.033]  It then took 700 years for the reconquest of Spain to kick the Muslims out.
[03:34:45.965 --> 03:34:58.288]  And the turning point came in the middle of the 800s, and now this is legend, myth, a religious belief, but this is a very powerful part of the Spanish mentality.
[03:34:58.848 --> 03:35:10.811]  They believe that after the time of Jesus and the Apostles, that the Apostles went to the different countries of the emerging Christendom, and that St.
[03:35:10.891 --> 03:35:13.992]  James was delegated to watch over Spain.
[03:35:14.072 --> 03:35:15.332]  This is a belief, a legend,
[03:35:16.801 --> 03:35:18.981]  And it wasn't until St.
[03:35:19.041 --> 03:35:27.603]  James arrived on the scene and he led the battles against the Muslims that they began to have victories.
[03:35:27.683 --> 03:35:34.824]  Now, it still took 700 years of constant warfare and fighting, but eventually all of the Muslims were expelled from Spain.
[03:35:35.424 --> 03:35:45.446]  This was the only country until Israel where a country under Islamic control was retaken and the Muslims were kicked out.
[03:35:46.508 --> 03:35:51.531]  I mean, now you can say, well, they got to Austria, they got to France, right, but they were never in control.
[03:35:51.811 --> 03:35:57.494]  These were like invasions that were military invasion forces that were thrown right out.
[03:35:58.470 --> 03:36:01.312]  But Spain was under complete Islamic domination.
[03:36:01.672 --> 03:36:07.155]  Sharia law, dimitude of, you know, slavery, horrible Islamic control.
[03:36:07.815 --> 03:36:12.697]  Don't let anybody tell you the PC lies that, oh, Spain under Islam was great.
[03:36:13.138 --> 03:36:16.779]  That would be like if the Nazis had won in Germany and got to write the history books.
[03:36:17.300 --> 03:36:19.561]  You know, that would be quite different than what we know.
[03:36:20.259 --> 03:36:28.102]  But this symbol, the reason I'm mentioning it, I became aware of it because of the Vlad Tepes blog website.
[03:36:29.722 --> 03:36:37.385]  The website's very critical to the counter-jihad because, as I said, he has translators who on a voluntary basis
[03:36:38.138 --> 03:36:41.662]  Subtitle these videos, you know, immediately as soon as they come out.
[03:36:41.982 --> 03:36:56.117]  So I go there every day and I share links, you know, on Facebook, on FreeZoxy now has its own web hosting service called Zox.ee, which is very slick, where Vlad Tepes is putting up his videos.
[03:36:56.618 --> 03:36:59.341]  But this is what I'm hoping to accomplish today.
[03:37:00.021 --> 03:37:03.767]  If people are going to look for a symbol, I think this is a good one.
[03:37:04.268 --> 03:37:06.491]  It can be on t-shirts, it can be on hats.
[03:37:06.891 --> 03:37:09.655]  I'd like to get stickers for my AR-15s.
[03:37:10.236 --> 03:37:14.743]  I mean, I think that it's a perfect antidote to the cultural Marxist
[03:37:15.359 --> 03:37:18.701]  It's a lie that's been told most of all of my life.
[03:37:19.082 --> 03:37:22.344]  And I'll give you some examples of these cultural Marxist lies.
[03:37:22.404 --> 03:37:25.286]  Remember, Marxists lie all the time.
[03:37:25.346 --> 03:37:26.046]  It's what they do.
[03:37:26.106 --> 03:37:33.351]  It's like Takiyah to Islam is what socialists and communists, globalists do with lying.
[03:37:33.972 --> 03:37:35.613]  They've perverted our faith.
[03:37:36.293 --> 03:37:42.798]  One of the examples I can give is the intentional mistranslation of the commandment
[03:37:43.368 --> 03:37:53.631]  From thou shalt not murder, which is a literal translation, to thou shalt not kill, which twists that commandment into a suicidal pacifism.
[03:37:53.651 --> 03:37:55.591]  I mean, thou shalt not kill?
[03:37:55.811 --> 03:37:56.131]  Really?
[03:37:56.531 --> 03:38:04.253]  Then you have to get rid of the police, get rid of the military, and if somebody's doing a home invasion, you just let them come in because you won't kill them.
[03:38:04.593 --> 03:38:05.634]  That's insanity.
[03:38:05.694 --> 03:38:06.574]  That's suicidal.
[03:38:07.285 --> 03:38:09.826]  Another example is turn the other cheek.
[03:38:10.326 --> 03:38:16.789]  Turn the other cheek was only ever intended in a personal family sense, you know, among friends, among your neighbors.
[03:38:17.209 --> 03:38:24.351]  It never meant that if the Nazis are invading, if the Japanese are invading, just turn the other cheek and let them come in.
[03:38:24.371 --> 03:38:33.515]  So this is the terrific job that the cultural Marxists have done to turn Christianity, which was never a suicide pact,
[03:38:34.136 --> 03:38:34.336]  I think?
[03:38:51.178 --> 03:38:59.966]  By great debating points, by writing speeches, you know, by sending emissaries with letters.
[03:39:00.546 --> 03:39:04.910]  Spain came back to Christianity because of this.
[03:39:05.671 --> 03:39:09.114]  There was a fighting part of this.
[03:39:09.414 --> 03:39:11.275]  There was a fighting part of this ideology.
[03:39:11.736 --> 03:39:18.742]  And it was to take the cross and make it a fighting tool, in a sense.
[03:39:19.766 --> 03:39:25.850]  In Spain, in almost every church, you'll see icons or statuary of St.
[03:39:25.890 --> 03:39:32.594]  James riding a white horse with a sword in his hand and the moors underneath of the hooves of his horse.
[03:39:33.275 --> 03:39:34.255]  His name is St.
[03:39:34.355 --> 03:39:36.016]  James Matamoros.
[03:39:36.517 --> 03:39:38.078]  It means, kill the moors.
[03:39:38.478 --> 03:39:44.882]  In almost every city, in every Spanish-speaking country, there is a town called Matamoros.
[03:39:45.482 --> 03:39:53.730]  You know, it wasn't... the reconquest didn't happen because the Muslims voluntarily converted to Christianity.
[03:39:54.130 --> 03:39:59.956]  It didn't happen because, you know, the priests out-debated them or gave such great sermons.
[03:40:01.087 --> 03:40:10.249]  The Spanish won and expelled the Muslims because they finally decided the only way is to organize militarily and drive them out with the sword.
[03:40:10.709 --> 03:40:18.791]  So my goal here in this segment is to encourage anybody who makes bumper stickers, hats, t-shirts, you can go online.
[03:40:18.831 --> 03:40:23.712]  I just found these, you know, copied off of, you know, right off of images online.
[03:40:24.192 --> 03:40:25.792]  But that's the symbol.
[03:40:26.292 --> 03:40:31.375]  Usually you'll see it with these little fleur-de-lis kind of things on the top.
[03:40:31.915 --> 03:40:35.897]  But that's the symbol that won Spain back from Islam.
[03:40:36.317 --> 03:40:42.921]  And if we're going to win this fight, it's going to take something like a reconquest eventually.
[03:40:43.281 --> 03:40:47.183]  And it starts in the mind with throwing off this
[03:40:47.823 --> 03:40:52.327]  It's a pacifist mentality that, you know, we should just turn the other cheek.
[03:40:52.387 --> 03:40:56.390]  If somebody's going to invade your country, cross your borders, oh, it's okay.
[03:40:56.711 --> 03:40:57.651]  We can't resist.
[03:40:58.012 --> 03:41:03.256]  Just let them come in and take over because, God forbid, we should ever fight back.
[03:41:04.490 --> 03:41:14.433]  One of the last things that Jesus said to his apostles was, you know, when I was, this was in the Garden of Gethsemane, right there at the end, you know, with Peter and the cock crowing and all of that.
[03:41:15.013 --> 03:41:21.035]  He said, when you were broke and you were shoeless, you know, when you had no money, no purse, did you need anything?
[03:41:21.075 --> 03:41:21.755]  They said, no.
[03:41:22.275 --> 03:41:25.156]  But he said, now you're going out on the road to spread the faith.
[03:41:25.919 --> 03:41:31.560]  And you have a purse, you know, basically to support yourself, you're going to need a sword.
[03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:33.681]  And they said, we have two swords.
[03:41:33.701 --> 03:41:34.921]  You said, OK, that's enough.
[03:41:35.121 --> 03:41:38.061]  So Jesus never said, be a pacifist.
[03:41:38.481 --> 03:41:41.582]  And if somebody wants to rob you, just let them have it.
[03:41:42.082 --> 03:41:51.544]  That would have meant no Christianity because it would have been a suicidal bunch of foolish pacifists, you know, like Quakers going into Comanche territory.
[03:41:51.544 --> 03:41:52.104]  We're good to go.
[03:42:18.499 --> 03:42:24.184]  If we just sit in a corner in the fetal position, sucking our thumb, we're going to lose.
[03:42:25.044 --> 03:42:30.209]  We need to push back against the cultural Marxists and the Islamists.
[03:42:30.649 --> 03:42:37.214]  They're not going to just suddenly come to their senses and realize that our culture is better.
[03:42:37.394 --> 03:42:38.275]  They're not going to.
[03:42:38.335 --> 03:42:39.396]  We have to fight for it.
[03:42:39.916 --> 03:42:42.619]  If we want to keep it, we have to fight for it.
[03:42:43.159 --> 03:42:46.101]  And all around us, we see people ready to surrender.
[03:42:46.562 --> 03:42:47.863]  And I'm not ready to surrender.
[03:42:48.583 --> 03:42:55.369]  Anyway, it gets me spun up thinking about this, but I'm going to be back in the next segment and we'll be taking calls then.
[03:42:56.010 --> 03:43:00.074]  So, let me see you on the other side of this.
[03:43:02.035 --> 03:43:09.082]  This past weekend, I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[03:43:10.390 --> 03:43:14.313]  And while I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald living section.
[03:43:15.754 --> 03:43:20.537]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe.
[03:43:21.197 --> 03:43:23.359]  It's all packaged very, very slickly.
[03:43:24.219 --> 03:43:34.527]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23, 2018, Section E living area, which should be how to not live.
[03:43:35.307 --> 03:43:41.589]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker right on your television, right?
[03:43:42.149 --> 03:43:42.769]  I'm not kidding.
[03:43:43.709 --> 03:43:49.191]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[03:43:50.391 --> 03:43:53.372]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[03:43:53.792 --> 03:43:56.173]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[03:43:57.683 --> 03:43:59.165]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[03:43:59.746 --> 03:44:05.414]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college and boys are depressed and boys can't get jobs and...
[03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:07.891]  You know what the problem is?
[03:44:08.151 --> 03:44:09.172]  Boys are boys.
[03:44:09.212 --> 03:44:13.556]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish, and how to be in dance class.
[03:44:14.457 --> 03:44:16.739]  That's why we need to teach them how to be like girls.
[03:44:18.441 --> 03:44:23.846]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[03:44:24.086 --> 03:44:29.131]  He worries that the people they interview in here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[03:44:30.857 --> 03:44:33.739]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[03:44:34.860 --> 03:44:38.363]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[03:44:38.823 --> 03:44:43.106]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[03:44:43.146 --> 03:44:49.971]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[03:44:50.712 --> 03:44:56.616]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[03:44:58.922 --> 03:45:02.366]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[03:45:02.386 --> 03:45:07.130]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[03:45:08.587 --> 03:45:08.887]  I don't know.
[03:45:32.802 --> 03:45:34.883]  Make sure everybody stayed in line.
[03:45:35.223 --> 03:45:38.185]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[03:45:39.305 --> 03:45:42.947]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[03:45:43.528 --> 03:45:45.189]  The whole human species is under attack.
[03:45:46.540 --> 03:45:53.443]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[03:45:54.243 --> 03:46:02.746]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[03:46:04.628 --> 03:46:09.692]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[03:46:10.593 --> 03:46:19.901]  We're three or four generations into this, and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms.
[03:46:21.082 --> 03:46:24.063]  And help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[03:46:24.903 --> 03:46:26.043]  That's how we're going to save them.
[03:46:26.924 --> 03:46:38.427]  Just like LBJ Bragg, 45 years ago, that he'd have black people voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[03:46:39.431 --> 03:46:40.452]  And that's how they operate.
[03:46:41.112 --> 03:46:44.675]  The article is sickening and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[03:46:45.236 --> 03:46:47.217]  Parents want their sons to be who he is.
[03:46:47.778 --> 03:46:50.140]  Not what society should say it should be.
[03:46:50.220 --> 03:46:53.463]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[03:46:53.783 --> 03:46:57.086]  They're the ones destroying your identity while claiming they're protecting it.
[03:46:57.166 --> 03:47:01.509]  They're the ones telling you what to be while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[03:47:05.613 --> 03:47:08.235]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.632 --> 03:47:31.814]  Okay, last segment.
[03:47:31.934 --> 03:47:34.594]  I'll be going to calls in just a moment.
[03:47:34.634 --> 03:47:41.836]  And before I do, it's one last chance to mention that it's the end of year clearance sale at the InfoWars store.
[03:47:42.576 --> 03:47:46.197]  So before all the new inventory comes in, they're clearing it out.
[03:47:46.317 --> 03:47:49.398]  So there's just crazy screaming deals going on.
[03:47:49.498 --> 03:47:52.599]  Half off, 60% off, all over the place.
[03:47:53.619 --> 03:47:55.360]  And I want to also mention
[03:47:56.329 --> 03:48:05.494]  Uh, this cross of Matamoros, the Saint James Cross, the what I hope becomes a symbol of the dissident alt-right.
[03:48:06.081 --> 03:48:07.162]  The Counter Jihad.
[03:48:07.902 --> 03:48:12.425]  You can get it at the VladTepesBlog.com.
[03:48:13.145 --> 03:48:21.831]  I'll be supporting a really key note in the Counter Jihad, which is VladTepesBlog.com.
[03:48:22.411 --> 03:48:30.216]  Anyway, let's go to calls now, and I see right on top of the list is Pastor Sam in Mexico City.
[03:48:30.996 --> 03:48:33.338]  Go ahead, Pastor Sam, if you're there.
[03:48:34.457 --> 03:48:36.357]  First of all, a big Amen, brother.
[03:48:36.538 --> 03:48:39.038]  It's a good interpretation of the Scripture on your part.
[03:48:39.718 --> 03:48:53.722]  I just shot my 30th lesson today, verse of the day for Gospel Gunslingers, and we are going through the entire Bible and redefining everything that has been changed under cultural Marxism, like you say.
[03:48:54.202 --> 03:48:57.602]  We have to rediscover the warrior faith of our forefathers.
[03:48:58.243 --> 03:49:04.064]  I wanted to talk to you about the rumbles of war in Latin America and South America, especially the Guyanas.
[03:49:04.557 --> 03:49:10.381]  Which are right now in collapse, and that's right next door to Venezuela.
[03:49:10.401 --> 03:49:13.143]  In fact, part of Venezuela is a Guyana.
[03:49:13.183 --> 03:49:14.544]  That was Spanish Guyana.
[03:49:15.224 --> 03:49:26.091]  Now there are three Guyanas that are sovereign nations still, and there was just a no-confidence vote in the first one, which is where Jim Jones' compound was.
[03:49:26.652 --> 03:49:28.793]  In Guyana, the English-speaking
[03:49:29.608 --> 03:49:35.712]  And they had a vote of no confidence in their parliament, which basically means that the government is being dissolved.
[03:49:36.112 --> 03:49:39.254]  It's forcing new elections right in the middle of the president's term.
[03:49:40.075 --> 03:49:53.104]  And one day after that happened, the Venezuelans intercepted Guyana-authorized oil research ships and tried to land their military helicopter on the deck of a Guyana ship.
[03:49:53.804 --> 03:49:56.126]  So the rumblings of war are there.
[03:49:56.746 --> 03:49:58.267]  The Venezuelan military
[03:49:59.066 --> 03:50:04.229]  Is really feeling their oats now that they've got backing both from Russia and from China.
[03:50:05.010 --> 03:50:07.391]  And all three of these nations are in collapse.
[03:50:07.951 --> 03:50:13.354]  Eastern Guyana, French... Wait a second.
[03:50:13.554 --> 03:50:18.917]  Are those Russian bombers, did they just visit Venezuela or are they rotating in and out and staying?
[03:50:18.977 --> 03:50:21.059]  Those blackjack bombers.
[03:50:21.179 --> 03:50:23.520]  Do you know if they're in Venezuela or if they just visited?
[03:50:24.372 --> 03:50:29.476]  That's a very good question, Matt, because there's disinformation coming out in the news.
[03:50:29.897 --> 03:50:38.504]  The Venezuelan Constitution, as if anybody there respects it, said that foreign military bases cannot be built on the mainland.
[03:50:38.744 --> 03:50:52.034]  However, Venezuela has possession of territorial islands, and the plan is for the Russians to build a base on a northern island north of Maracaibo and Caracas in the Caribbean.
[03:50:52.355 --> 03:50:53.736]  And so that island
[03:50:54.369 --> 03:50:54.709]  I think so.
[03:51:11.164 --> 03:51:17.130]  Yeah, this reminds me of Grenada when we we did the Grenada intervention in 1983.
[03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:23.936]  And that's when the Cubans were building bomber capable runways in on the island of Grenada.
[03:51:24.036 --> 03:51:27.379]  So that led to a military intervention under Reagan.
[03:51:27.439 --> 03:51:28.520]  So I wonder what
[03:51:29.088 --> 03:51:31.589]  What military preparations are being made?
[03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:41.035]  You know, if Venezuela, I've heard that they're acting against Colombia also because of all the rampant smuggling and the people going back and forth across the border.
[03:51:42.035 --> 03:51:48.719]  Yeah, war could definitely be coming to the northern littoral of South America, that's for sure.
[03:51:50.757 --> 03:52:00.020]  I've got to get some other calls in the next few minutes, so can you wind us up with a, kind of come to a conclusion, so then I can take another call or that wouldn't be fair.
[03:52:00.920 --> 03:52:01.960]  Yes, sir, 30 seconds.
[03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:02.940]  Two things.
[03:52:03.220 --> 03:52:09.082]  First of all, December the 1st, Jair Bolsonaro, the Trumpist president, takes over the presidency of Brazil.
[03:52:09.542 --> 03:52:13.463]  The Donald is waiting for that to happen before major military conflagration.
[03:52:14.091 --> 03:52:17.474]  Second, the President of Columbia is a total Bushite.
[03:52:17.774 --> 03:52:25.519]  He's a puppet of the prior President, Alvaro Uribe, who Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he cannot be trusted.
[03:52:25.559 --> 03:52:28.922]  He's a warmonger, even though there are migrants coming into his country.
[03:52:29.242 --> 03:52:30.483]  Thanks for taking my call, Matt.
[03:52:31.884 --> 03:52:32.264]  Thank you.
[03:52:32.284 --> 03:52:37.668]  So we'll keep an eye on South America because, you know, this is a test of the Monroe Doctrine.
[03:52:37.688 --> 03:52:39.650]  A lot of people have been saying, you know, what the heck?
[03:52:40.700 --> 03:52:42.921]  Allowing the Russians and Chinese to take over.
[03:52:42.981 --> 03:52:45.822]  I mean, China controls both ends of the Panama Canal.
[03:52:47.002 --> 03:52:48.843]  Essentially, they control the canal, therefore.
[03:52:49.563 --> 03:52:53.325]  And Russians are building bomber bases along the coast of Venezuela.
[03:52:53.365 --> 03:52:54.625]  This is pretty serious stuff.
[03:52:56.086 --> 03:52:57.146]  Jerome in New York.
[03:52:57.986 --> 03:53:00.787]  Come on, if you're still there, Jerome.
[03:53:01.328 --> 03:53:02.208]  Yeah, I'm here, Matt.
[03:53:02.248 --> 03:53:03.368]  Hey, Happy New Year to you.
[03:53:03.568 --> 03:53:04.269]  Good talking to you.
[03:53:04.889 --> 03:53:05.329]  You too.
[03:53:05.709 --> 03:53:06.449]  Happy New Year.
[03:53:07.190 --> 03:53:07.810]  Thank you so much.
[03:53:08.419 --> 03:53:16.923]  I'd say I don't hardly ever disagree with you, but there's one thing here I want to kind of disagree with you on as far as Trump losing the election behind the economy issue.
[03:53:16.963 --> 03:53:18.104]  I don't think he will.
[03:53:18.384 --> 03:53:20.725]  It's all about that border down there.
[03:53:21.325 --> 03:53:27.148]  If he don't have that border taken care of, he don't have a chance in hell, excuse me, he don't have a chance to get out to win in 2020.
[03:53:27.328 --> 03:53:30.270]  And the Democrats, he knows it, so does the Democrats.
[03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:32.951]  That's why they're going to burn it to the ground before they give him a nickel.
[03:53:34.614 --> 03:53:43.277]  Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see if he maintains the government shutdown with a Democrat Congress because he still has the power of the veto.
[03:53:43.997 --> 03:53:46.498]  No bill can be passed without his signature.
[03:53:46.518 --> 03:53:51.080]  So all he has to do is not sign it, which they call a pocket veto.
[03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:54.281]  So I think he should hold firm on the wall.
[03:53:54.321 --> 03:53:57.462]  In fact, he might say every day is going to be another billion I want.
[03:53:58.162 --> 03:54:00.003]  Don't negotiate down, negotiate up.
[03:54:01.263 --> 03:54:01.923]  Thanks, Jerome.
[03:54:01.983 --> 03:54:03.904]  I do think that is key, the border.
[03:54:04.879 --> 03:54:06.540]  Bob in Tennessee.
[03:54:06.620 --> 03:54:07.260]  Go ahead, Bob.
[03:54:09.622 --> 03:54:09.962]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:09.982 --> 03:54:10.522]  Just one thing.
[03:54:10.542 --> 03:54:12.703]  First of all, how proud I am.
[03:54:12.923 --> 03:54:13.824]  I'm a veteran myself.
[03:54:14.004 --> 03:54:16.405]  But I go with the last caller here.
[03:54:16.485 --> 03:54:19.446]  I think it's time to press this attack.
[03:54:19.506 --> 03:54:20.727]  And here's why I say this.
[03:54:21.447 --> 03:54:26.430]  Look, if 4% of the population wins against the British, surely a polarity of folks
[03:54:26.997 --> 03:54:30.898]  Well, they're winning on the numbers in a sense, demographically, because look at California.
[03:54:30.918 --> 03:54:32.539]  California used to be solid Republican.
[03:54:49.930 --> 03:54:54.151]  And now it's got, you know, they say a few million illegal aliens.
[03:54:54.211 --> 03:55:03.995]  I think that for districting congressional districts, they count the illegals and they're doing this vote harvesting door to door.
[03:55:04.075 --> 03:55:04.535]  It's like
[03:55:05.223 --> 03:55:06.184]  It's over for this country.
[03:55:26.909 --> 03:55:29.550]  I mean, there will never be another Republican president.
[03:55:29.610 --> 03:55:33.031]  That's another reason why the border wall is so critical.
[03:55:33.572 --> 03:55:41.395]  Demographically, we're just being swamped, and the people coming in are going to vote Democrat 80% forever, and their children.
[03:55:41.415 --> 03:55:43.976]  So, thanks for the call there.
[03:55:44.656 --> 03:55:46.657]  Jason in Michigan, we've still got some time.
[03:55:47.317 --> 03:55:48.618]  Jason in Michigan, go ahead.
[03:55:48.638 --> 03:55:52.199]  Hi, Merry Christmas to everybody and Happy New Year.
[03:55:53.420 --> 03:55:54.340]  Back at you, go ahead.
[03:55:55.003 --> 03:55:55.884]  I have a few topics.
[03:55:56.104 --> 03:55:57.867]  I'll just roll through as fast as I can.
[03:55:58.768 --> 03:56:06.598]  First of all, to get through the Schiff real quick, Peter Schiff is definitely a perma-bear and a broken clock is right twice a day.
[03:56:07.199 --> 03:56:08.821]  He's definitely a big gold and silver bug.
[03:56:09.523 --> 03:56:33.435]  And I think that if gold and silver were to reach their true value instead of their paper value, that the people who control the banks would be very unhappy with the way that a lot of people who have been saving their silver for years and years that are technically poor now would be all of a sudden in a new tax bracket, and that would make everybody very unhappy that's in the upper tax bracket to suddenly have all these new people popping in.
[03:56:33.855 --> 03:56:38.958]  But on the topic of South America, I brought up this configuration impending.
[03:56:39.548 --> 03:56:52.277]  In the South Caribbean with Alex a few weeks ago, and basically, you know, the United States has made a lot of omelets, and it takes a lot of breaking of eggs to make those omelets, and a lot of those eggs have come from South America.
[03:56:52.397 --> 03:57:01.523]  So they do have some reasons to be mad at us, but we definitely need to avoid the whole Russia-China buildup.
[03:57:01.563 --> 03:57:03.364]  There is some serious stuff going on down there.
[03:57:03.404 --> 03:57:08.828]  If you study Fitbit maps, you can see all these little islands where there's this crazy military activity going on.
[03:57:09.466 --> 03:57:14.848]  Obama gave two little pieces of rock in the South Caribbean to Russia, so that is Russian territory.
[03:57:14.888 --> 03:57:21.691]  They get a 200-mile naval radius around that, and they have turned that into little islands with little airstrips.
[03:57:22.091 --> 03:57:24.132]  There's all sorts of crazy stuff going on down there.
[03:57:24.552 --> 03:57:26.553]  You brought up the Panama Canal with China.
[03:57:26.953 --> 03:57:35.596]  They just launched their new smart city stuff down in Cologne on the inner, in the South Caribbean side of that, and they totally have
[03:57:36.963 --> 03:57:42.845]  Okay, Jason, we're going to let you go there, because we're just plain running out of time, but I'm certainly going to keep my eye on the South Caribbean.
[03:57:42.865 --> 03:57:46.587]  I've been down there a couple times, and it's very interesting.
[03:57:46.627 --> 03:57:51.388]  We'll definitely keep a strong weather eye on Venezuela.
[03:57:53.369 --> 03:57:54.489]  We're ending the year.
[03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:56.570]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[03:57:56.650 --> 03:57:57.591]  It's been an insane year.
[03:57:58.891 --> 03:58:06.414]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming, and the lawsuits, the demonization, and the attacks, and everything else, because of one thing.
[03:58:07.532 --> 03:58:18.479]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers, understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[03:58:19.499 --> 03:58:23.582]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down.
[03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:27.691]  If we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[03:58:27.711 --> 03:58:33.112]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[03:58:33.132 --> 03:58:35.833]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[03:58:36.173 --> 03:58:38.133]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[03:58:39.794 --> 03:58:41.674]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[03:58:41.714 --> 03:58:44.075]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[03:58:44.935 --> 03:58:47.576]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[03:58:48.936 --> 03:58:52.017]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[03:58:54.400 --> 03:58:59.730]  And so they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany.
