[00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.413]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:17.094]  Mainstream Media.
[00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:18.774]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.015]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.375]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:27.657]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:33.138]  And now, a word from our sponsors.
[00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.489]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:36.509]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.350]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.150]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.810]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.992]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:51.517]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:53.278]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:57.140]  It's time I get confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:00:58.496 --> 00:01:03.263]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:05.966]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:08.870]  It was almost as if it were a planned imposal.
[00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.573]  It's just pancakes.
[00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:15.119]  They took the baby out of incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.780]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.881]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:25.181]  U.S.A.
[00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:28.302]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.982]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.663]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:34.223]  Some former U.S.
[00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.003]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:39.584]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:45.426]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:46.866]  Russian scum!
[00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:47.826]  Denied everything.
[00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.127]  He called it all fake news.
[00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.248]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.408]  This is a national emergency.
[00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.970]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.071]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:05.192]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:10.915]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:14.037]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:17.038]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:21.020]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:23.522]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.880]  Yes it is, my friends.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.461]  Wow.
[00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.341]  Here we are, Wednesday, the ninth day of May, 2018.
[00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:32.062]  I'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:34.583]  Then Roger Stone, Owen Schroer in the War Room.
[00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:39.944]  Zach from High Level Intelligence in the U.S.
[00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:46.166]  will be joining us with his take on the unprecedented Israeli strike yesterday.
[00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:56.970]  Just south of Damascus, at one of their largest air bases, killing a bunch of Syrians, Iranians, and reportedly maybe even some Russians.
[00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:03.953]  Israel lost it within an hour of Trump withdrawing from the Iran deal, but very little coverage.
[00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:09.956]  I went on CNN last night, five hours after, six hours after, zero coverage.
[00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:14.718]  Which is really bizarre, but I've got a take on why that's happening.
[00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:37.334]  We've got Beth Chapman of course who works with Dog the Bounty Hunter to break down how bizarre it is as well that Google is coming in saying that they're gonna ban bail bondsmen and bail bonds ads just like we now know Broward County's gone from lying to defending it that the shooter there Nicholas Cruz
[00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:50.100]  Was in a anti-racism program where criminals that had committed a bunch of crimes were threatened to kill people are not sent to jail or juvenile detention.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.540]  They're just basically turned loose.
[00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.041]  And so that he was actually protected.
[00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:55.682]  That's incredible.
[00:03:55.702 --> 00:04:00.123]  So that ties into Europe letting Muslims rape children as young as 10 years old.
[00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:03.844]  Finland's Supreme Court just ruled on Tuesday.
[00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:05.544]  No, no, it was Monday.
[00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:07.125]  I saw it on Tuesday that
[00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.143]  Muslims are allowed to rape children because it's their culture.
[00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:14.126]  Talk about hospitality.
[00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:17.370]  When I say that on air, it sounds insane.
[00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.433]  It doesn't sound real, but it's mainstream news.
[00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:20.254]  They're very proud of it.
[00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:22.117]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:23.599]  Leo Zegami is going to be on.
[00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:29.694]  For at least 45 minutes of the second hour to take your phone calls and here's the deal.
[00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:36.356]  A lot of people claimed rappers and other folks they've been on secret societies are in elite secret societies.
[00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:42.699]  Zagami, we never make a big deal about what he's been on the show, but Zagami has been in the real Illuminati.
[00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:44.859]  At least a large branch of it in Rome.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.902]  His family's aristocratic and part of the establishment and I know people that also are, let's just say on the
[00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:53.874]  We're good to go.
[00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:08.665]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.166]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:10.587]  Go ahead.
[00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:10.967]  Yes.
[00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:12.128]  Hi, Alex.
[00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:18.433]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:22.616]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:24.318]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:31.384]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.326]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:39.889]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:47.753]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:05:47.773 --> 00:05:53.596]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:59.038]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.120]  And it's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:19.219]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:22.945]  Well, three U.S.
[00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:33.248]  hostages that have been held in North Korea for a long, long time are on their way back with the director of the CIA, now the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo.
[00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:34.908]  Another big victory for Trump.
[00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:41.649]  Another signal that North Korea is going to denuclearize and begin the process of merging with the South.
[00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.690]  I first told you that on March 8th.
[00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:57.260]  A full month before it was ever in the news that they had already agreed tacitly to Trump's demands under the massive maximum pressure sanctions, as Trump dubbed it.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:10.710]  And I also said that the South also was in talks with them to merge in a 10-year plan with the North, starting with an economic trade deal and coal-powered stations.
[00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.072]  That's word for word what I told you.
[00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:33.224]  And then last night I noticed in the Associated Press that South Korea handed over a thumb drive with a reunification economic plan to start now and to go over the next 10 years ahead of full unification with a Part 2 10-year plan, but the first 10-year plan to begin coal-powered stations and factories.
[00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:36.436]  Word for word.
[00:07:37.097 --> 00:07:45.443]  And I asked the source from the White House, State Department connected, why I was given this in March while I was on vacation in Colorado for a week.
[00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:49.206]  And they said, because we want to boost your credibility.
[00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.048]  Because they're trying to destroy your credibility, son.
[00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:54.970]  That's what these giant disinfo campaigns are all about.
[00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:04.277]  We're going to keep giving you pieces of intelligence ahead of others because CNN and MSNBC and Soros can't stand it, son.
[00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:07.588]  And there you go!
[00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:31.623]  Speaking of that demonization campaign, let's first play a clip of the embattled, corrupt governor of New York's brother, the same governor's right-hand man who's been caught reportedly savagely beating women and calling them brown slaves, as a champion of the MeToo movement, of course.
[00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:47.805]  And then he's got his little brother on CNN, who's known to be a drunk driver, hit-and-run individual, who hit-and-run right in front of the town square, but he's allowed to.
[00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:48.565]  He's a Como.
[00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:54.647]  Here's a guy saying, I'm a horrible, evil person, with Roger Stone last night.
[00:08:55.007 --> 00:09:04.010]  But before we go to that clip, here he is telling you, like you're a dog, that you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.350]  Here it is.
[00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:10.295]  Also interesting is, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:11.335]  It's different for the media.
[00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:14.256]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:18.237]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:19.138]  Joining us now, CNN.
[00:09:19.398 --> 00:09:20.798]  And then it wasn't full disclosure.
[00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:23.359]  It was a total whitewash with diversionary stuff.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.661]  He didn't cover CNN being given the questions ahead of time.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.182]  CNN giving the questions to Donna Brazile ahead of time.
[00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:44.510]  He didn't cover stuff like that, or Hillary actually running CNN, the New York Times, MSNBC, with her staff daily telling them what headlines to have, how to cover things.
[00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.051]  Sounds exhausting, doesn't it?
[00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:51.014]  But Cuomo's back, saying, well, Alex Jones is such a horrible person.
[00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:53.556]  He said those horrible things about the Sandy Hook parents.
[00:09:55.239 --> 00:10:10.024]  No, I never said anything about the Sandy Hook parents other than my listeners pointed out anomalies that many people, including myself, thought meant it could be staged.
[00:10:10.084 --> 00:10:12.965]  And we have that right as citizens under the First Amendment.
[00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:20.868]  Paul Watson got on me, Aaron Dykes got on me, and we've released the emails from the year after saying we think this is bull.
[00:10:22.253 --> 00:10:25.436]  And we don't like it, and we think these families look legitimate.
[00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:28.959]  And so I said, you know, I respect you guys, and I started softening my stance.
[00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:37.327]  But I'm allowed to question things when we have babies in incubators that never happen to get us into a war that kills millions of people.
[00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:41.451]  You got Hillary lying about being in combat in Serbia, being shot at on tarmac.
[00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:42.031]  It's not true.
[00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:44.513]  Ryan Williams lying about being shot down in helicopters.
[00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:50.047]  Lies about WMDs that killed hundreds of thousands more, including tens of thousands of our troops.
[00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:58.030]  And now Newsweek, CNN, last week admitting that the White Helmets have lost U.S.
[00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:06.613]  funding because they are ISIS-Al Qaeda connected and have been caught staging the fake chemical attack that almost took us to war three weeks ago.
[00:11:09.474 --> 00:11:13.215]  So see, I question that because the White Helmets have been caught doing it before.
[00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:16.603]  No matter how many Netflix TV shows they have.
[00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:24.689]  And again, we reported that in Broward County there was a police stand down according to witnesses we had on and local news clips.
[00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:27.731]  Now it's confirmed.
[00:11:27.972 --> 00:11:39.760]  Broward Superintendent Defends Program which shielded school shooter over four years, Nicholas Cruz, from arrest as he vandalized, as he attacked, as he threatened to kill and murder people with firearms.
[00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:44.863]  The police were called 22 times.
[00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:46.484]  The FBI was called three times.
[00:11:49.066 --> 00:12:08.019]  Now what does CNN and Como do when I have local news clips that they don't want seen, that national news doesn't cover, but are on three local TV stations, and we have two students on, saying the exact same thing, that there were deputies standing down everywhere, not just one, not just two, not just four, but more than ten.
[00:12:10.261 --> 00:12:11.742]  What are they going to do?
[00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:31.750]  They're going to say that I said no one died in Florida at Parkland, and they have the Washington Post saying that I attacked a woman with the same name as Emma Gonzalez, but with no link, no proof, total lie.
[00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.931]  They're never going to drop this.
[00:12:34.318 --> 00:12:36.220]  So I'm going to make films about it all.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.342]  I'm going to go knock on doors.
[00:12:39.462 --> 00:12:40.723]  I'm going to visit everybody.
[00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:45.827]  I'm going to make this a huge issue because they want it to be my Waterloo and it's not.
[00:12:46.387 --> 00:12:49.410]  And my top lawyer, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country,
[00:12:50.762 --> 00:12:51.623]  Went to a D.C.
[00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:59.771]  conference over the weekend, and I'm trying to get him to write an article or come on the show about it, and he said, no, they're definitely trying to set a precedent, set a statute to overturn the First Amendment.
[00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:00.952]  He didn't believe this before.
[00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:12.524]  Using you, claiming you're causing violence and threats on people, he said, I have saw multiple law professors on the stage saying, Alex Jones killed people
[00:13:13.886 --> 00:13:15.568]  At the pizzeria in D.C.
[00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:21.212]  It's now that I killed people and people died from Pizzagate that I didn't even create.
[00:13:23.414 --> 00:13:27.097]  And they're saying that I got people killed in connection to Sandy Hook.
[00:13:27.117 --> 00:13:29.679]  So they're basically saying I killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.501]  This is a way to defame me.
[00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:37.886]  So it is next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:47.371]  And when they set the precedent, they were saying this on the stage, they're going to say they can preemptively ban entire groups of people from speech and overturn the First Amendment.
[00:13:48.012 --> 00:13:49.032]  So it's now official.
[00:13:51.013 --> 00:13:55.036]  And my lawyer, Mark Balin, didn't fully believe me when I was telling him this.
[00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.396]  He said, no, it's true.
[00:13:56.557 --> 00:13:57.057]  I was there.
[00:13:57.537 --> 00:13:58.818]  I saw it at a top conference.
[00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:03.069]  They are saying they're going to end the First Amendment.
[00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.350]  And that you killed people at the pizza place.
[00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:09.711]  That is just insane.
[00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:14.292]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I killed people.
[00:14:14.532 --> 00:14:16.292]  He walked over to these professors after they spoke.
[00:14:16.692 --> 00:14:17.892]  He said, nobody died there.
[00:14:19.913 --> 00:14:21.193]  And they did nothing to say.
[00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:22.873]  They know it's not true.
[00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:25.194]  It's cuckoo-level disinfo.
[00:14:25.894 --> 00:14:29.735]  But let's go out to break with Roger Stone on Cuomo, where he's demonizing.
[00:14:29.775 --> 00:14:30.055]  Here it is.
[00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.101]  What do you say is the best reason to read Roger Stone's book?
[00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:42.006]  Well, what's interesting to me is when I post the link to buy this book on Google, within hours, they call it spam.
[00:14:42.307 --> 00:14:45.669]  When I post an ad to buy it at Amazon or Barnes & Noble,
[00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:49.391]  They call it, you know, they reject the ad.
[00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:53.294]  This kind of internet censorship is very, very dangerous.
[00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:54.975]  It's what we're experiencing in InfoWars.
[00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:56.717]  I do a show that... Who's Gary, by the way?
[00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:57.377]  Who is...?
[00:14:57.977 --> 00:14:58.698]  The tech left.
[00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:00.399]  The large tech left?
[00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:01.020]  Yes, indeed.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.802]  So, I do a show, as you do, five days a week.
[00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:04.542]  It's a lot of work.
[00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:09.726]  I can't get my show loaded on YouTube, my InfoWars show, because it's controversial.
[00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:10.947]  I'm against censorship.
[00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:12.909]  You know what the problem is with InfoWars.
[00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:17.033]  You know what Alex Jones has done in the interest of publicity.
[00:15:17.073 --> 00:15:19.235]  And you're familiar with the First Amendment, I believe.
[00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:19.736]  Yeah.
[00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:25.201]  Well, on that basis, I don't think anybody should say... Just because you have the right to say something doesn't mean it's right to say it.
[00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:26.783]  Millions and millions of people are watching.
[00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:28.164]  Him smearing the Newtown people?
[00:15:28.184 --> 00:15:28.825]  You can't be unbelieving.
[00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:33.853]  I disagree with some of the things he has said, but even he has backed off that.
[00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:40.864]  The point is censorship, and we're struggling to stay alive because we can be arbitrarily censored, and that is dangerous.
[00:15:41.866 --> 00:15:43.827]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you for making the case.
[00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:48.349]  Your book is Stone's Rules, How to Win in Politics, Business, and Style.
[00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:49.289]  Roger Stone.
[00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:52.670]  The book's available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.051]  That helps us fund our operation.
[00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:55.232]  But CNN knows.
[00:15:55.352 --> 00:16:00.434]  CNN has quarterbacked trying to get YouTube to ban us using lies they put out about us.
[00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:01.814]  It's tortious interference.
[00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:02.695]  Bake it.
[00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:05.576]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:19.400]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.404]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.922]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:53.304]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:19:53.444 --> 00:19:59.568]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:19:59.748 --> 00:20:01.969]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:08.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.953 --> 00:20:26.154]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:20:26.654 --> 00:20:29.115]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:29.615 --> 00:20:32.035]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.116 --> 00:20:37.877]  Chaos is hanging around.
[00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.638]  A tree to the ground.
[00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:43.999]  Shattered from the sound.
[00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:48.520]  The death machine ain't slowing down.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.241]  It's gaining power.
[00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.152]  So, it's official.
[00:20:53.613 --> 00:20:59.665]  My lawyer went to a big Democrat lawyer convention, and they openly said they're going to end the First Amendment.
[00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:09.970]  And they're going to ban all conservatives from speech and they're going to use yours truly as the test case of disinformation and lies to create the case law and the cases.
[00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:18.297]  And they are saying that I murdered people and I have killed people at the pizza place in D.C.
[00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:23.601]  That is the level on the stage, law professors saying I murdered people in D.C.
[00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.043]  or I caused murders in D.C.
[00:21:26.778 --> 00:21:29.499]  This is the magnitude of, I mean, they're making their move.
[00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:33.899]  My lawyer last, yesterday, was verbally shaking his head over the phone.
[00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:35.880]  He said he just couldn't believe it.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.160]  He'd never seen anything like it.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.721]  Total lying hysteria.
[00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:44.561]  Speaker after speaker after speaker.
[00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:51.143]  And you call the ACLU, you call other big groups, and they go, we know they're attacking Jones.
[00:21:51.183 --> 00:21:52.523]  We know they're ending the First Amendment.
[00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:53.483]  We're not getting involved.
[00:21:56.152 --> 00:21:57.313]  They're making their move, folks.
[00:21:58.033 --> 00:22:02.575]  That's why they had this professor in Slate Magazine Friday say, censorship isn't enough.
[00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:09.059]  Jones must be banned from the internet and all school children must be taught he is evil.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:24.948]  And then there were multiple news articles without me even looking out of Kansas City and out of Austin, Texas, written the same
[00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:31.984]  With a local grandfather and a father going to the school and teaching the girls how evil I am last week.
[00:22:32.404 --> 00:22:33.945]  And the girls becoming sick.
[00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:35.606]  Each article said they became sick.
[00:22:35.906 --> 00:22:36.926]  They put the template out.
[00:22:37.286 --> 00:22:38.687]  They probably didn't even visit the schools.
[00:22:40.088 --> 00:22:42.409]  And then you're reading in the paper, the girls became frightened.
[00:22:42.449 --> 00:22:43.369]  They became sick.
[00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.170]  They were shown Alex Jones.
[00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.872]  This is like I'm living in a 1984 movie.
[00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:54.575]  We must go to all the schools and teach the children he is evil.
[00:22:56.314 --> 00:22:58.715]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:01.496]  Cue Rod Serling, please.
[00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.900]  Now that said, let me tell you all the news coming up today.
[00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:13.282]  Why are they mad?
[00:23:17.133 --> 00:23:29.140]  Because all over the foreign press, including the German news and even the British news, even though they're so controlled, it still came out that the rebels launched the last three chemical attacks and then got caught doing the fourth one.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:42.527]  And the kids that they showed that supposedly died are fully alive on international television, including Germany's top TV station, saying, we were told we'd be given dates and candy if they could spray water on us.
[00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:44.989]  And they put green makeup on them to make them look dead.
[00:23:45.768 --> 00:23:47.128]  And it's the exact kids on TV.
[00:23:48.189 --> 00:23:51.470]  They're flying 15 of them around Europe on a tour right now.
[00:23:58.332 --> 00:24:03.073]  And then Trump saw it last week and withdrew U.S.
[00:24:03.493 --> 00:24:07.035]  support of over $50 million a year to the White Helmets.
[00:24:09.595 --> 00:24:14.677]  Now, of course, this broke three weeks ago with respected investigative journalists out of the UK.
[00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:19.720]  But now even CBS News is having to report it.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.141]  And do you know in the internal Google documents that came out late last year that Mike Cernovich got us?
[00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:28.183]  In November when he came and visited with his wife?
[00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:31.624]  Google said, no, those are real documents.
[00:24:32.824 --> 00:24:33.644]  And we made a mistake.
[00:24:33.664 --> 00:24:34.945]  We're not going to ban Alex Jones.
[00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:43.768]  And the documents were millions of dollars to hire third-party firms to go and manipulate their algorithm because Google didn't want to touch its algorithm then.
[00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:44.548]  They've now broken it.
[00:24:44.808 --> 00:24:45.789]  It doesn't even work anymore.
[00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:46.649]  It's all screwed up.
[00:24:48.294 --> 00:24:57.456]  They broke the algorithm, but at least last winter they weren't ready to do it, so they were hiring companies to downvote InfoWars, oh, and Ron Paul.
[00:24:59.817 --> 00:25:05.398]  Now there's the article, you can scroll down if you're a TV viewer, visiting InfoWars.com and actually see the documents.
[00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:17.601]  And why did they say, they said, they exposed that the chemical weapons attacks were staged by ISIS and the White Helmets.
[00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:28.922]  Oh, and a year later, because that was last April, the articles from November, December, they launched it again and it didn't work.
[00:25:29.082 --> 00:25:31.964]  All the fake videos that CNN showed are now admittedly fake.
[00:25:33.004 --> 00:25:36.366]  I mean, it's not as if you need to be a weapons inspector that actually goes there to know that.
[00:25:36.586 --> 00:25:39.288]  You can watch the videos, but the weapons inspectors did get there.
[00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.930]  And the rebels
[00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:49.066]  We're shooting at the American inspectors because they didn't want them in there to prove it didn't even happen.
[00:25:50.767 --> 00:26:02.097]  Now, that's good news because the last three times they launched real chemical attacks.
[00:26:03.838 --> 00:26:05.139]  And they killed a bunch of innocent people.
[00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:10.283]  So at least this time they got a little more moral, I guess, in ISIS, where they didn't have any chemicals.
[00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:13.446]  And so they just said it happened.
[00:26:14.462 --> 00:26:16.082]  But if you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this.
[00:26:16.142 --> 00:26:38.969]  I'm showing CBS News admitting the rebels staged a chemical attack that didn't even happen, and ran a bunch of neighborhood kids through the local hospital, and then kicked the regular doctors out, the White Helmets did at gunpoint, and then had their guys dress up in white lab coats, and then do some of the worst acting I've seen.
[00:26:40.089 --> 00:26:43.130]  I mean, a 10-year-old, you know, kids in a 10-year-old play,
[00:26:44.349 --> 00:26:46.631]  Ten-year-olds in a play can do a better job than this.
[00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:48.792]  This is the height of bad acting.
[00:26:48.972 --> 00:26:50.133]  And now we know it's acting.
[00:26:50.473 --> 00:26:51.334]  So why do they hate us?
[00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:55.757]  Because every time, we're one of the only outlets in the U.S.
[00:26:55.777 --> 00:26:56.697]  that will tell you the truth.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.780]  And they know truth's infectious.
[00:27:03.902 --> 00:27:09.886]  Just like we told you the day after it happened, we had two different students on.
[00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:12.948]  We showed videos from three different newscasts of other students
[00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:22.333]  In Parkland saying there were deputies all over the place, they lined their cars up, they waited 10-15 minutes outside till it was all over.
[00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:26.837]  David Hogg was at home.
[00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:28.659]  He didn't get there till after.
[00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:34.750]  He wasn't there until after so he couldn't have shot the videos inside?
[00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.610]  I'm not even saying that!
[00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.030]  The students were saying this!
[00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.391]  And then Hogg later admitted it!
[00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:40.151]  No, I was at home and rode my bike!
[00:27:40.671 --> 00:27:43.112]  Well, how are you there going, he's outside shooting right now!
[00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:44.792]  I'm in there with a teacher!
[00:27:47.193 --> 00:27:48.353]  I don't know what went on there.
[00:27:48.413 --> 00:27:49.273]  I mean, people died.
[00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:50.974]  And I'm not saying Hogg's a crisis actor.
[00:27:51.134 --> 00:27:53.674]  I'm saying that they didn't want that out.
[00:27:54.195 --> 00:27:55.815]  And that's why they want us off the air.
[00:27:57.847 --> 00:27:58.667]  But here's the good news.
[00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:00.908]  Everybody knows how to watch this stuff now.
[00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:02.629]  Infowars is just big.
[00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:11.993]  And these old, crotchety, brain-dead globalists, who've got one foot in the grave, they think they can shut us up, and then shut everybody else up.
[00:28:12.513 --> 00:28:13.053]  Good luck!
[00:28:13.633 --> 00:28:14.994]  You're the ones collapsing.
[00:28:15.314 --> 00:28:16.514]  You're the ones falling apart.
[00:28:16.815 --> 00:28:19.956]  Trump's talking about not giving you your press credentials, because you're certainly not press.
[00:28:21.436 --> 00:28:21.937]  CNN?
[00:28:24.298 --> 00:28:26.218]  He won't shut up even after he goes to you.
[00:28:26.499 --> 00:28:27.059]  You take over
[00:28:27.918 --> 00:28:28.459]  His events?
[00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:29.500]  Absolutely.
[00:28:30.121 --> 00:28:31.283]  Fake news is working overtime.
[00:28:31.323 --> 00:28:36.110]  Just reported that despite the tremendous success we're having with the economy and all the other things.
[00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.313]  91% of the network news about me is negative.
[00:28:38.373 --> 00:28:38.633]  Fake.
[00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:42.479]  Why do we work so hard if working with the media when it's corrupt?
[00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:44.939]  Take away credentials?
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.921]  Yeah, see, they want to take away our entire First Amendment.
[00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:50.301]  Trump's just talking about kicking them out of the White House.
[00:28:50.822 --> 00:28:51.902]  And that's not censorship.
[00:28:52.282 --> 00:28:54.503]  It's CNN calling for InfoWars to be shut down.
[00:28:55.223 --> 00:29:01.606]  They're an un-American criminal organization that's bankrolled by George Soros and other crown bosses.
[00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:10.193]  Well, Mark John Randazza is one of the top anti-slapback lawyers, slapback lawyers in the country.
[00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:13.734]  And of course, he's buddies with the great Mike Cernovich.
[00:29:13.814 --> 00:29:17.435]  So, Mark, what do you think's really going on as one of the leading experts on this?
[00:29:17.656 --> 00:29:18.536]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:32.862]  Step one is to recognize that our First Amendment jurisprudence, the roster of people who are on it, who have protected freedom of expression, are by and large conscripts.
[00:29:33.722 --> 00:29:34.103]  I think so.
[00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:53.104]  When you've been wrongfully sued, you're saying it's really a holy duty of your Americana to do this.
[00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:53.785]  Bingo.
[00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:55.087]  And it's a privilege.
[00:29:55.447 --> 00:29:58.751]  Now, of course, those privileges don't come cheap.
[00:29:58.831 --> 00:30:00.713]  Freedom isn't free, as they say.
[00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:06.420]  So, I would say that, you know, you have enough of an audience here, I would say, to crowdfund your defense.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:25.667]  Not only because that helps defray the cost, but, you know, when you see a crowdfunded defense that raises a lot of money really quickly, the plaintiff's lawyers might start to see that your amount of support is greater than they think.
[00:30:26.722 --> 00:30:30.743]  The other thing I would make sure that you do is, you know, not give in to any of them.
[00:30:30.803 --> 00:30:42.927]  I mean, this is, you know, I'm not saying anything about any particular case, but when I see a coordinated effort to try to shut down any player in the marketplace of ideas, it's a form of terrorism.
[00:30:43.067 --> 00:30:54.571]  It's a, it is, and I don't use that term lightly, but it is a, it is an attempt to abuse the court system in order to erase ideas you don't like that you're not comfortable fighting in the marketplace of ideas.
[00:30:55.171 --> 00:30:56.451]  Don't let them get away with it.
[00:30:56.572 --> 00:30:59.372]  And all of your viewers should not let them get away with it.
[00:30:59.432 --> 00:31:06.115]  But more importantly is people who don't agree with you shouldn't let them get away with it either.
[00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:19.899]  And when you can harness people to get together in order to protect freedom of expression, people who will say, my tribe is freedom of expression, not my tribe is people that believe in what I believe in or people who don't.
[00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:23.882]  I don't really care whose free speech rights it is that are being trampled.
[00:31:23.902 --> 00:31:25.503]  I will stand up to protect them.
[00:31:25.523 --> 00:31:29.766]  Whether it's Randa Jarrar, who I find to be one of the most reprehensible human beings in America.
[00:31:30.247 --> 00:31:34.650]  Whether it's the Nazi Party, the KKK, or whether it's the Communist Party.
[00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.692]  Every one of them has an equal right to be there.
[00:31:38.273 --> 00:31:47.800]  And the intellectual texture of America, the strength of America, the idea of America, erodes and begins to grow a cancer if we don't protect that.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:56.924]  So nobody should be cheering bogus lawsuits against anybody just because it's going to shut somebody up that they don't like.
[00:31:57.564 --> 00:32:00.886]  Anyone who is on the side of doing that, that's our common enemy.
[00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:04.329]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:33:16.275 --> 00:33:18.441]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:18.942 --> 00:33:24.076]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:25.297]  Just got an email back, so I was a little bit late getting into the seat here, from the Washington Post, where they put out an article, very sneakily, very devilishly, very underhandedly, saying that I said there's another Emma Gonzalez who's a crisis actor, who isn't a crisis actor, and that she's getting death threats.
[00:34:27.838 --> 00:34:31.480]  We never said it, none of our guests ever said it, it's a total fraud.
[00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:43.026]  And here's the smart mouth response we got back from the reporter at pakwetatwashpost.com or Visos.
[00:34:44.963 --> 00:34:46.404]  Disinformation Command Center.
[00:34:46.424 --> 00:34:47.945]  Hi, Kit.
[00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:52.427]  Ryan told me he gets his news from the blogosphere and people like Alex Jones.
[00:34:53.047 --> 00:34:56.569]  As the piece notes, he prefers to follow people who publish conspiracy theories.
[00:34:57.189 --> 00:34:58.930]  And that's where he learned about Emma.
[00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.531]  Hope that clears things up.
[00:35:00.851 --> 00:35:07.955]  Yeah, you just republished the same thing in this email that you put out in your so-called publication.
[00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:11.377]  And again, it's not the stuff's even hurting me.
[00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:18.027]  This is how they continue to put it out, and then you'll see these individuals on TV going, Just stop, Alex!
[00:35:18.087 --> 00:35:19.648]  Look what you did to Emma!
[00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:22.331]  Stop saying she's a crisis actor!
[00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:24.393]  Stop saying no one died!
[00:35:24.533 --> 00:35:25.675]  My goodness, man!
[00:35:25.695 --> 00:35:28.798]  The Washington Post is begging you to quit!
[00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:58.686]  And that's the tactic they use, and that's why America hates these people so much, that they had to be propped up by the richest man in the world, who made $12 billion two weeks ago in one day, Bezos, the big sweatshop owner, that now owns Whole Foods, as the quality plummets there on record, and you got Carlos Slim, the corrupt kingpin that made, some say $9 billion, some say $6 billion, but over $6 billion on the Obama phones!
[00:35:59.166 --> 00:36:01.207]  See, behind every little free goodly,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.981]  Find everything fun for all the little freebies.
[00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:08.861]  There's some type of screw job by these guys.
[00:36:09.581 --> 00:36:11.902]  All their money always comes from inside deals.
[00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:22.504]  This poor woman, after he learned about it on Alex Jones that she was a crisis actor, is now under attack and being threatened.
[00:36:22.544 --> 00:36:23.764]  Look what Jones has done.
[00:36:24.525 --> 00:36:27.105]  We heard from some guy he got it from Jones.
[00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:28.505]  Show where I said it!
[00:36:29.206 --> 00:36:30.666]  That's how they fence the lie.
[00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:38.492]  You know, when you steal something, you go to a pawn broker, a pawn shop, and they fence the theft.
[00:36:39.373 --> 00:36:42.613]  They put a layer of deceptions.
[00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:49.795]  They go, oh, I talked to a guy who says he heard it from you, and now we're gonna say it.
[00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.855]  And I heard from a guy, there's WMDs in Iraq.
[00:36:53.695 --> 00:36:56.776]  And I heard from a guy, the moon's made out of cheese.
[00:36:58.131 --> 00:36:59.692]  Okay, let me hit some of the big headlines.
[00:37:00.353 --> 00:37:02.414]  We got a jam-packed guest today.
[00:37:03.275 --> 00:37:04.075]  Leo Zegami.
[00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:16.904]  We advertised him as a best-selling author on the Vatican that predicted that this current head of the Jesuit order would become the next Pope and that you would have two Popes at one time.
[00:37:16.924 --> 00:37:22.148]  And he just predicted everything because he has been a member of the real Illuminati.
[00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:26.071]  And, you know, we never really advertised Zegami as that.
[00:37:28.424 --> 00:37:44.175]  But he really is somebody who has been, let's just say, at the first few levels of groups that maybe only a few thousand people are in, the real P2, the real outer circles of the Illuminati.
[00:37:45.276 --> 00:37:57.165]  He's also been inside the Knights of Malta, he's been inside high-level Islamic orders, and I never really advertised him as, you know, inside a real Illuminati operative coming up today.
[00:37:58.214 --> 00:38:03.678]  An exclusive discussion with an Illuminati operative, or former Illuminati operative, Leo Zagami.
[00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:06.000]  But that's really who he is.
[00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:08.122]  I've been to Rome, I've met with him.
[00:38:08.982 --> 00:38:10.944]  He's led us into places nobody else could get into.
[00:38:10.964 --> 00:38:14.026]  He knows the Swiss Guard, all of it.
[00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:19.851]  But the real proof is, I've known Zagami for 12 years, none of his work longer.
[00:38:21.513 --> 00:38:27.117]  The real proof of the pudding is his predictions, his accuracy, his everything.
[00:38:27.137 --> 00:38:29.238]  He almost won the Italian Senate race.
[00:38:29.678 --> 00:38:34.741]  They threw him in a mental institution for a week and put it in the news so that he didn't win by a few points.
[00:38:34.802 --> 00:38:40.945]  So he's quite a mover and shaker over in Italy, over in Rome.
[00:38:43.547 --> 00:38:46.869]  So this will be an interesting discussion with Leo.
[00:38:46.889 --> 00:38:50.512]  You know, he didn't think he was coming on about that today, just about the Vatican and take your phone calls.
[00:38:54.338 --> 00:38:59.240]  Why not have him get into why he knows all this?
[00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:02.522]  By the way, I said get him on at 15 after.
[00:39:02.622 --> 00:39:04.323]  Let's go ahead and get him on about 10 after.
[00:39:04.403 --> 00:39:09.725]  I've got a few things I've got to cover at the start of the next hour, but then I want to go right to him so he can break this down, because this is really inside.
[00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:11.246]  You want the inside baseball?
[00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:11.866]  This is coming up.
[00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:14.107]  This is the type of thing I should promote for like a week coming up.
[00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:17.269]  Then I just get so close to the info, I'm kind of like, okay, Leo Zoghami.
[00:39:19.912 --> 00:39:21.033]  Or the other big guest we have on.
[00:39:22.073 --> 00:39:26.696]  But, a little bit of pre-hype here, something I don't normally do because it definitely warrants it.
[00:39:27.957 --> 00:39:37.723]  Beth Chapman, the National President of the Bounty Hunter Association, talking about Google saying no to Bell's bondsman ads and how that's part of this agenda to legalize crime around the country and the world.
[00:39:38.144 --> 00:39:40.385]  And will you guys pull from yesterday's stack, my whole stack on that?
[00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:41.726]  Okay.
[00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:46.389]  And then also how they're legalizing Islamic crime and how they're, how the,
[00:39:49.244 --> 00:39:56.008]  Parkland shooter was also in a similar program and allowed to make death threats and vandalize and physically attack people because his last name was Cruz.
[00:39:57.188 --> 00:39:58.389]  You know, he wasn't even Hispanic.
[00:39:58.969 --> 00:40:02.751]  They went, oh, we're not going to put you in this, uh, you know, jail.
[00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:06.393]  We're just going to let you roam free because we're not racist.
[00:40:06.433 --> 00:40:06.773]  That's right.
[00:40:06.793 --> 00:40:07.934]  An anti-racism program.
[00:40:08.214 --> 00:40:13.857]  They stood down on purpose at every level physically that day for years while he threatened to kill everybody.
[00:40:14.137 --> 00:40:15.238]  He was known as a school shooter.
[00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:24.440]  And our crime was exposing it so they lied and said we said no one died and it was fake to again lie to you.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.341]  But guess what?
[00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.602]  Everybody knows the White Helmet staged the attacks now.
[00:40:29.403 --> 00:40:30.404]  That's CBS News.
[00:40:30.524 --> 00:40:31.705]  Everybody knows it.
[00:40:32.025 --> 00:40:34.246]  Everybody knows that Broward County stood down.
[00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:37.328]  Evidence is pointing towards on purpose to let it happen.
[00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:41.191]  Another blue city where all these things happen so they can blame gun owners.
[00:40:42.152 --> 00:40:42.752]  Yet again.
[00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.494]  How bombshell is that?
[00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:50.563]  Now, when we come back, Trump's getting three hostages back.
[00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:54.886]  Israel struck Syria yesterday at one of their major airports.
[00:40:54.906 --> 00:40:55.867]  Almost no coverage of that.
[00:40:56.127 --> 00:40:56.928]  That says something.
[00:40:57.688 --> 00:41:01.491]  We're going to have Zach popping in to cover that and more in the next segment.
[00:41:02.492 --> 00:41:15.661]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, if you believe in this broadcast and you want to stand against the rushing torrent of globalist disinformation and attempts to shut us down,

[00:42:33.524 --> 00:42:34.765]  Turmeric is well known.

[00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:41.071]  Bodies, whole body support.

[00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:16.408]  The fan favorite is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:16.488 --> 00:43:23.952]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[00:43:24.012 --> 00:43:28.774]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:29.495]  As you age,
[00:43:29.835 --> 00:43:30.276]  We all do.
[00:43:30.516 --> 00:43:34.641]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:36.083]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:40.208]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[00:43:40.228 --> 00:43:47.917]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[00:43:48.718 --> 00:43:57.704]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and change your mood that often comes with time and age.
[00:43:57.884 --> 00:44:06.030]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.351]  It is Alpha Power.

[00:44:15.337 --> 00:44:17.258]  Go and read the five-star review.
[00:44:17.278 --> 00:44:18.819]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:19.039]  Go ahead.
[00:44:35.687 --> 00:44:37.529]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:40.592]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:44:41.433 --> 00:44:42.554]  It just gets old, man.
[00:44:42.875 --> 00:44:44.577]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:44:45.277 --> 00:44:47.359]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.604]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:44:51.624 --> 00:44:52.885]  Do you understand?
[00:44:52.905 --> 00:44:54.046]  I'm ringing the alarm.
[00:44:54.907 --> 00:44:57.229]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:58.669]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.830]  Us being shut down?
[00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.131]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:45:01.551 --> 00:45:02.572]  You know what, Alex?
[00:45:02.632 --> 00:45:03.693]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:45:03.713 --> 00:45:04.553]  Hey, Frank!
[00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:10.177]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:45:10.477 --> 00:45:14.779]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.881]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:45:18.141 --> 00:45:18.522]  You understand?
[00:45:18.602 --> 00:45:19.883]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:20.243 --> 00:45:21.363]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:22.364 --> 00:45:27.287]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:45:27.947 --> 00:45:28.668]  Do you understand?
[00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:29.929]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:45:30.329 --> 00:45:31.790]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:45:35.256 --> 00:45:37.118]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:45:37.138 --> 00:45:37.439]  Go ahead.
[00:45:37.539 --> 00:45:41.384]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:45:41.544 --> 00:45:46.550]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:52.678]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[00:45:53.519 --> 00:46:01.827]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:46:02.448 --> 00:46:05.331]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:46:06.011 --> 00:46:09.655]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:46:09.735 --> 00:46:17.022]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immuno wall, I'm just
[00:46:17.222 --> 00:46:21.363]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:46:21.783 --> 00:46:25.084]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:46:25.764 --> 00:46:30.025]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[00:46:30.525 --> 00:46:36.107]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well at water.
[00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:40.688]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:46:41.564 --> 00:46:42.865]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:46:43.045 --> 00:46:48.367]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:46:48.387 --> 00:46:49.747]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:46:49.767 --> 00:46:49.907]  Yeah.
[00:46:50.068 --> 00:46:51.948]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:46:51.988 --> 00:46:52.809]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:54.529]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:46:54.569 --> 00:46:55.530]  We really appreciate you.
[00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:56.590]  Keep up the fight.
[00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.031]  We need to take California back.
[00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:58.451]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:46:58.491 --> 00:46:59.532]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[00:46:59.572 --> 00:47:00.212]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:47:06.414 --> 00:47:09.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.121]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:36.424]  Everyone knows that I'm a big supporter of President Trump.
[00:47:37.264 --> 00:47:40.967]  And that I like what he's doing, bringing sovereignty back to the country.
[00:47:40.987 --> 00:47:48.951]  You know a man by his enemies, George Soros, Hillary, the globalists, they have been de-industrializing this country by design for decades.
[00:47:49.512 --> 00:47:52.614]  So I'm still a big Trump supporter, but when he struck,
[00:47:53.803 --> 00:47:55.624]  The Syrian airbase last year.
[00:47:55.824 --> 00:48:04.270]  I said, listen, that may satiate the warmongers, but we know that the White Helmets and ISIS and Al Qaeda have been caught staging chemical attacks before.
[00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:05.531]  And then U.S.
[00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:06.291]  and U.N.
[00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:09.433]  inspectors went and said it was the rebels again.
[00:48:10.174 --> 00:48:10.894]  They have the motive.
[00:48:10.934 --> 00:48:13.396]  Well, this year in April, they were pulling out.
[00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:14.377]  The Russians were leaving.
[00:48:14.937 --> 00:48:15.337]  The U.S.
[00:48:15.377 --> 00:48:16.418]  was announcing they were leaving.
[00:48:17.219 --> 00:48:21.742]  Yesterday, the final pockets of ISIS in Syria were pushed out.
[00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:23.543]  That was announced in the morning.
[00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:33.109]  Trump gives a speech, within an hour of it, Israel starts launching missiles at a large airbase south of Damascus, the capital of Syria.
[00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:45.012]  And what's even crazier is, six hours later, I'm going to bed, after I'd even covered it, so it's about eight hours after it happened, and no coverage on CNN.
[00:48:45.632 --> 00:48:51.213]  Almost no coverage anywhere, but a little bit on Fox, a little bit on Infowars.com, Trudge Report had a link.
[00:48:52.486 --> 00:48:54.207]  What if Iran responds?
[00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:55.967]  Well, a missile got fired.
[00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.148]  We're now learning from a country outside Saudi Arabia.
[00:48:59.768 --> 00:49:03.169]  And almost hit the Imperial Palace.
[00:49:03.649 --> 00:49:10.211]  So Zach, who again is an expert on the Middle East, expert on Libya, soon may be revealing his identity to everybody.
[00:49:10.251 --> 00:49:12.372]  He's been on television and been in print before.
[00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:13.752]  He's a known quantity to us.
[00:49:14.112 --> 00:49:16.953]  He's got a lot of information for us about how dangerous this is.
[00:49:17.393 --> 00:49:19.674]  I shot a live video after Trump's speech yesterday at about 4.
[00:49:21.554 --> 00:49:26.199]  Right as this was starting, not even knowing, saying this could trigger a large Israeli-Iran war.
[00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:28.081]  People are like, oh, you're being a warmonger.
[00:49:28.101 --> 00:49:36.269]  Well, now mainline analysts are saying that, but I think we pretty much have a war with missiles, ICBMs being fired out of, you know, Yemen.
[00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:40.258]  Clearly by Iranian-connected forces into Riyadh.
[00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:43.121]  These tit-for-tats going back and forth.
[00:49:43.141 --> 00:49:47.064]  So is this Israeli response a tit-for-tat from missiles fired months ago?
[00:49:47.104 --> 00:49:49.766]  Or is it part of the larger Saudi Arabian civil war?
[00:49:50.146 --> 00:49:51.147]  Zach, thanks for joining us.
[00:49:52.728 --> 00:49:59.350]  Yes, Alex, it's great to be back on and be able to connect some dots here, provide some context to the situation that's going on, because what's going on is very critical.
[00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.290]  What's occurring as we speak is Iraq 2.0.
[00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:06.371]  The war that Iran is in full effect now, and it's just beginning.
[00:50:06.391 --> 00:50:14.873]  What we have to understand is it's no coincidence that Israel strikes this town in Kiswah, just south of Damascus.
[00:50:15.353 --> 00:50:18.154]  I mean, really within minutes after Trump signs
[00:50:19.594 --> 00:50:21.774]  The changes there, getting rid of the Iran deal.
[00:50:22.335 --> 00:50:25.635]  This is very dangerous, and I'm going to put this in the pretext.
[00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:26.575]  I'm going to pretext with this.
[00:50:27.276 --> 00:50:36.397]  I support Donald Trump, I like Donald Trump, but he does not receive blind trust, because what's going on right now in Iran is on behalf of the Saudi Arabians and has to do with the military-industrial complex 100%.
[00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:40.918]  Okay, the hypocrisy is so amazing in its entirety.
[00:50:41.418 --> 00:50:43.779]  So, let's just get people some context here.
[00:50:44.259 --> 00:50:47.881]  So it's Saudi Arabia, Israel, and deep state elements of our U.S.
[00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:50.103]  government that have pulled off 9-11.
[00:50:50.723 --> 00:50:53.444]  But now, ever since then, Iran is this culprit.
[00:50:53.845 --> 00:50:56.706]  It's unbelievable, and it's a huge, huge problem.
[00:50:56.766 --> 00:50:59.328]  And the idea that, oh, you're being sensational, this isn't a war.
[00:50:59.728 --> 00:51:05.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are striking missile sites in Syria that are Iran-ran.
[00:51:05.712 --> 00:51:08.834]  Fifteen soldiers cut forces out of Iran, being killed.
[00:51:08.874 --> 00:51:09.874]  Two civilians there.
[00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:16.418]  You have the Houthis in Yemen shooting Scuds there at Riyadh, and even ballistic missiles.
[00:51:16.438 --> 00:51:17.799]  A lot of stuff was shut down.
[00:51:17.979 --> 00:51:19.120]  Firefights in the country.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.061]  It's going down.
[00:51:22.842 --> 00:51:23.563]  It's no big deal.
[00:51:23.663 --> 00:51:24.964]  People are acting like nothing's going on.
[00:51:24.984 --> 00:51:25.864]  This is everything.
[00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:36.492]  This is the perpetuation of war in the Middle East, the military industrial complex... By the way, when I talked to you last night, just a few hours into this, you said, look at the amnesia, look how there's no coverage.
[00:51:36.652 --> 00:51:37.873]  And that's critical.
[00:51:37.973 --> 00:51:40.876]  And now, a day later, there's almost no coverage of this.
[00:51:41.136 --> 00:51:42.377]  What does that signify?
[00:51:43.793 --> 00:51:44.414]  It's crazy.
[00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:45.615]  People can't connect the two dots.
[00:51:45.955 --> 00:51:48.918]  All of a sudden, Saudi Arabia is our closest ally?
[00:51:49.438 --> 00:51:50.099]  How could that be?
[00:51:50.259 --> 00:51:52.981]  I ran bad Saudi Arabia good.
[00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:54.242]  Folks, I've got some news for you.
[00:51:54.523 --> 00:51:56.925]  Saudi Arabia is bad, bad, bad news.
[00:51:56.985 --> 00:51:59.807]  But we want to go over there, wave swords, build this empire.
[00:51:59.907 --> 00:52:00.268]  I get it.
[00:52:00.288 --> 00:52:01.649]  If we're going to work, they're going to reform.
[00:52:01.689 --> 00:52:01.969]  I get it.
[00:52:02.189 --> 00:52:05.653]  But we're talking about destabilizing the Middle East and really carrying out the plan.
[00:52:05.673 --> 00:52:06.653]  We've got a big problem here.
[00:52:07.634 --> 00:52:09.416]  I've got a big problem right here with Donald Trump.
[00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:14.599]  What happened to Donald Trump on the stage telling Hillary Clinton that, uh, you know,
[00:52:15.672 --> 00:52:20.276]  It's a good thing a guy like you wouldn't be in office, and he cuts her off and says, yeah, because you'd be in jail.
[00:52:20.656 --> 00:52:21.977]  Well, here's the thing, bud.
[00:52:22.078 --> 00:52:23.819]  You are in office, and she's not in jail.
[00:52:23.879 --> 00:52:25.280]  And in fact, we're starting a new war.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.321]  So what's going on here?
[00:52:26.401 --> 00:52:29.164]  For all the good you're doing, and you're doing good, this is not good.
[00:52:29.524 --> 00:52:32.646]  And I'm not going to have blind allegiance here, because this is a war.
[00:52:32.687 --> 00:52:33.968]  This is about global peace.
[00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:39.032]  And what's going on here is nothing more than doing the bidding of the Saudi Arabias, because they are the highest bidders at the table.
[00:52:39.132 --> 00:52:40.113]  And they are not our friends.
[00:52:40.513 --> 00:52:41.315]  They are the highest bidders.
[00:52:41.335 --> 00:52:43.319]  We are business partners, but we are not friends.
[00:52:43.419 --> 00:52:45.764]  It's so... The hypocrisy is amazing.
[00:52:46.124 --> 00:52:47.808]  And this is the big issue.
[00:52:47.928 --> 00:52:51.014]  They stress and stress and stress that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.
[00:52:51.355 --> 00:52:51.836]  Is that right?
[00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:54.082]  All right, well let me speak to the listeners right now.
[00:52:54.102 --> 00:52:56.003]  We're all Second Amendment supporters, right?
[00:52:56.364 --> 00:52:57.844]  We're Second Amendment supporters here.
[00:52:58.065 --> 00:53:01.987]  We understand the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
[00:53:02.307 --> 00:53:08.511]  So we've been running this whole line of the, when it comes to the nukes, the whole nana nana boo boo, we have nukes but you can't two game.
[00:53:08.932 --> 00:53:09.672]  How can that be?
[00:53:09.892 --> 00:53:11.073]  Let's look at track records.
[00:53:11.153 --> 00:53:19.078]  If I was a sovereign country, you better believe I'm trying to get nukes, and how are you going to have the moral high ground and tell me that I can't use them when you're the only entity
[00:53:19.498 --> 00:53:20.739]  Well, here's the other issue.
[00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:26.363]  If the globalists weren't globalists and doing this to actually promote American values, it'd still be wrong, but it wouldn't be as bad.
[00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:36.990]  The globalists hate America and hate our freedom are the ones trying to destabilize the Middle East and kick out good actors or neutral actors, put bad ones in to work with Turkey to try to conquer Europe.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.041]  And the country's under, like we talked about, amnesia.
[00:53:42.142 --> 00:53:47.264]  It's a very frightening amnesia with the apocalypse of information and all the collage of chaos, everything that's going on.
[00:53:47.664 --> 00:53:50.245]  And you'll hear these people, and they'll come out, and this will be the justification.
[00:53:50.626 --> 00:53:54.607]  Well, the lawmakers in Iran are burning American flags and chanting, Death to America.
[00:53:54.627 --> 00:53:55.868]  Well, I've got a newsflash for you.
[00:53:55.888 --> 00:53:58.009]  I'll take you to 100 college campuses as we speak.
[00:53:58.169 --> 00:54:01.373]  Let me explain that psychological warfare equation and dialectic.
[00:54:01.433 --> 00:54:03.695]  The big mega foundations, Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller,
[00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:24.356]  All fund, hate America, hate the police, hate the military, hate free market when they're the ultra-rich, because they want a domesticated population.
[00:54:24.376 --> 00:54:25.437]  That's all declassified.
[00:54:25.717 --> 00:54:40.728]  They have America do their dirty work, then they own publications worldwide that then demonize America and blame it, telling people that Americans all back this, so when they bring America down to China, down the road, the world accepts it as a good thing.
[00:54:40.949 --> 00:54:42.430]  So that's how sophisticated this is.
[00:54:43.556 --> 00:54:44.016]  Absolutely.
[00:54:44.036 --> 00:54:48.798]  The idea that this is about peace and cleaning things up, this is about money and oil.
[00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:54.040]  Unfortunately, the greatest export in this country is war and entertainment.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.681]  And sadly, they have merged.
[00:54:55.941 --> 00:54:56.862]  And the public has bought it.
[00:54:57.362 --> 00:54:57.902]  They have bought it.
[00:54:58.182 --> 00:54:58.542]  What is this?
[00:54:58.622 --> 00:54:59.363]  Perpetual war?
[00:54:59.403 --> 00:55:00.463]  We're just going to build an empire?
[00:55:00.763 --> 00:55:02.004]  I'm not here to stick up for Iran.
[00:55:02.044 --> 00:55:03.904]  I'm America first, truly, through and through.
[00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:04.665]  That's just the way it is.
[00:55:05.045 --> 00:55:12.048]  But the idea, if we're going to look at track record, and see who's in the empire-building business, it's very clear here.
[00:55:12.468 --> 00:55:24.153]  So we have to stand up, and we can backtrack on certain fronts here, but what's going on here is this weird military-industrial complex, empire-building, in conjunction with Saudi Arabia to take over the Middle East as we take over the rest of the world, and eventually... Sure, sure.
[00:55:24.393 --> 00:55:27.575]  This is what Wesley Clark broke down ten years ago, but let's give him...
[00:55:29.133 --> 00:55:39.781]  Near term, short term, near future, how this can kick off into a wider war very quickly if the Iranians or the Syrians, as you said in our text messages, even flinch.
[00:55:41.162 --> 00:55:45.646]  Okay, so we see how crazy what went on in Syria is.
[00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:49.889]  Obvious false flag, completely fabricated, terrible acting.
[00:55:51.573 --> 00:55:52.113]  We're good.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:13.801]  We're good to go.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.282]  Well, where was that military industrial complex creature created and funded?
[00:56:44.822 --> 00:56:45.782]  Oh yeah, Saudi Arabia.
[00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:47.463]  Like, give me a break here!
[00:56:48.003 --> 00:56:49.364]  We got big, big problems here!
[00:56:49.644 --> 00:56:52.905]  And it's all, I understand the enthusiasm, I understand the momentum.
[00:56:52.925 --> 00:56:54.586]  Sure, well let's, Zach, stay there.
[00:56:54.706 --> 00:57:05.271]  We're coming back in two minutes to put bookends on this, and then give them the latest on Mueller and what your take is on that, your intel is on that, and then Leo Zegami's gonna join us inside the Vatican, inside
[00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:09.604]  A very deep branch of the Masonic Illuminati.
[00:57:10.085 --> 00:57:10.566]  For real.
[00:57:10.626 --> 00:57:11.226]  That's coming up.
[00:57:11.627 --> 00:57:12.388]  Please don't forget.
[00:57:12.408 --> 00:57:13.729]  They're trying to censor us.
[00:57:13.749 --> 00:57:14.570]  They're trying to block us.
[00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:17.634]  On the local AM you're listening to or FM, please support them.
[00:57:17.654 --> 00:57:19.496]  Please spread the word about the local station.
[00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.698]  Same thing for local cable, local TV.
[00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:22.840]  Please spread the word.
[00:57:24.082 --> 00:57:25.202]  Buy it and add the newspaper.
[00:57:25.443 --> 00:57:26.123]  Put up a billboard.
[00:57:26.163 --> 00:57:26.803]  This is a war.
[00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:28.684]  We need your help, so thank you all for your help.
[00:57:29.024 --> 00:57:30.324]  And please shop with the good guys.
[00:57:31.205 --> 00:57:40.268]  50% off our entire family of Super Blue fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine toothpaste and our Ultimate Bodies turmeric formula.

[00:57:40.808 --> 00:57:43.409]  I decided to do that even though supplies are running low.
[00:57:43.649 --> 00:57:46.030]  I want to get those of you off the fence that haven't tried it.
[00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:47.110]  I think you're going to get hooked.
[00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.771]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:57:48.811 --> 00:57:49.231]  Stay with us.

[00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:09.905]  Listen to all these incredible 5 star reviews from verified buyers.
[00:58:10.265 --> 00:58:13.369]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:23.000]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy and wake up positive regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.443]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:58:25.663 --> 00:58:27.364]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:58:27.564 --> 00:58:30.226]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[00:58:30.466 --> 00:58:35.009]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:41.393]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:58:41.833 --> 00:58:46.376]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:58:46.836 --> 00:58:47.977]  That helps with focus, too.
[00:58:48.417 --> 00:58:49.398]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[00:58:49.898 --> 00:58:54.021]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:58.484]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[00:58:58.764 --> 00:59:00.305]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:59:00.565 --> 00:59:01.206]  For the better.
[00:59:01.626 --> 00:59:05.408]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:07.490]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:08.771]  I hope this lasts.
[00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:11.672]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:59:11.972 --> 00:59:18.093]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:59:18.373 --> 00:59:23.315]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:59:23.775 --> 00:59:27.095]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:59:27.696 --> 00:59:32.717]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:59:33.277 --> 00:59:35.098]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[00:59:35.358 --> 00:59:35.898]  Not anymore.
[00:59:36.278 --> 00:59:37.459]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:39.860]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.481]  I will definitely buy this again.
[00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:45.603]  Head to InfoWarStore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[00:59:46.303 --> 00:59:48.484]  That's InfoWarStore.com.
[00:59:55.587 --> 01:00:00.249]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:21.227 --> 01:00:25.751]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:32.215]  Alright, Zach is a highly connected intel individual.
[01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:34.077]  Really smart, like to have him on, has a lot of courage.
[01:00:34.837 --> 01:00:38.240]  Soon he'll be hopefully coming on the show and revealing his identity.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.181]  He's got to think about getting out of the military entirely.
[01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:42.683]  If he's going to do that, he's got a lot of stuff going on.
[01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:44.685]  But if you've got
[01:00:45.902 --> 01:00:49.125]  Trump's starting to diverge from what he said he would do, unless you look at it like this.
[01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:57.331]  The deal six years ago was made by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dempsey, to block Obama turning the entire Middle East over to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:00:57.811 --> 01:01:06.078]  And our own military started working with the Russians to block the full takeover, because most of the rebels, 90 plus percent, were ISIS, al-Nusra, slash Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:07.018 --> 01:01:07.859]  Rebranded Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.683]  And the deal was that Iran would then pull out, and then Assad would have elections,
[01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:21.555]  Once that was over, and we first learned about this from Colonel Schaefer and others and Tosh Plumling, and then years later it came out that that unofficial deal was made.
[01:01:22.075 --> 01:01:24.076]  So Trump could argue Iran's not pulling out.
[01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:28.018]  That's what Israel said this week is, you pull out or we're going to start attacking you.
[01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:33.280]  So I'm not defending what Trump did, but I mean, it looks like that's the deal here.
[01:01:33.381 --> 01:01:41.384]  And some could say, Israel's saying, through unofficial sources, that Iran was readying offensive missiles and pointing them at Israel.
[01:01:42.839 --> 01:01:45.960]  My issue here is, should we just have sanctions on Iran?
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.940]  Should we go that direction?
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.281]  This immediate escalation is beyond saber-rattling.
[01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:54.082]  And then how does Korea then play into that equation?
[01:01:54.402 --> 01:02:02.144]  How much of this is ahead of the Korean deal with Trump making statements like, Trump, United States no longer makes empty threats.
[01:02:02.225 --> 01:02:03.385]  We'll put that up on screen, please.
[01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:03.665]  Go ahead.
[01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:07.311]  Yeah, well, let's just get one thing clear.
[01:02:07.351 --> 01:02:08.912]  Not offensive missile movements.
[01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:10.933]  That would be complete defensive missile movements.
[01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.434]  Iran's not perpetuating anything.
[01:02:12.754 --> 01:02:22.299]  I mean, listen, I'm not pro-Iran, but the idea that they're launching attacks, or like, yeah, they're getting ready for Qaddafi 2.0, they're getting ready for Iraq 2.0.
[01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:24.260]  If you were them, you'd be doing the same thing there.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.462]  But, you know, and here's the thing.
[01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.464]  They all say trust the plan.
[01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:29.545]  Yeah, let's trust the plan.
[01:02:30.085 --> 01:02:34.690]  The plan was lock her up, not keep it up when it comes to military-industrial conflicts.
[01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.811]  This is a problem.
[01:02:36.051 --> 01:02:38.614]  This is a real, real problem here, because he's doing a lot of good.
[01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:41.797]  And if you want to go to the Korean Peninsula, we spoke about it six months ago.
[01:02:41.817 --> 01:02:46.922]  Nobody uttered these words, strategic patience, until me, until yourself and I were on air
[01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:51.868]  We first laid out what the new policy was and I confirmed that with Pchenik and a bunch of others.
[01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:59.358]  In fact, we should go back on all the shows you were on and show how you were dead on months before and so was I. Just so folks know why we're under such attack.
[01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:01.459]  A hundred percent.
[01:03:01.539 --> 01:03:05.921]  So I got a real problem with, you know, perpetuating military industrial complex building.
[01:03:06.262 --> 01:03:10.504]  Meanwhile, Hussein, Huma, and Hillary are chilling fist bumping with Richard Branson.
[01:03:11.945 --> 01:03:14.047]  Lock her up, not keep it up.
[01:03:14.267 --> 01:03:15.147]  That was the plan.
[01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:17.028]  So they want to talk about trust the plan, this and that.
[01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:17.889]  This is ridiculous.
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.509]  I don't know.
[01:03:34.156 --> 01:03:44.362]  Well, Trump said he does what he says he's going to do, and so far as presidents go, I haven't seen any president in modern history that has followed through on what they said as much as Trump.
[01:03:44.762 --> 01:03:48.985]  But on foreign policy, he's breaking, and we know, because they kill you if you don't.
[01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:52.447]  But if he starts breaking on this, what else will he break on?
[01:03:52.487 --> 01:03:54.228]  We'll see if Iran comes to the table.
[01:03:54.568 --> 01:03:59.771]  We'll see if carrying a big stick and being very, very clear makes them start to back down.
[01:04:00.172 --> 01:04:01.532]  I don't think that's enough for Saudi Arabia.
[01:04:01.573 --> 01:04:03.174]  Like you've said, they're going to want a wider war.
[01:04:03.554 --> 01:04:06.936]  They want to get their foot on the neck of Iran, and that's not going to happen.
[01:04:08.194 --> 01:04:08.534]  Well, yeah.
[01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:10.856]  That's like saying, coming to the table.
[01:04:10.896 --> 01:04:12.197]  Coming to the table for what?
[01:04:12.657 --> 01:04:17.400]  Are we not going to admit that 9-11 was an inside job, which has been your life's work?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.883]  Are we not going to admit that the military-industrial complex is ransomware?
[01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.595]  They're going to put something worse in.
[01:04:39.615 --> 01:04:42.216]  They're going to break it up in five parts and have civil wars.
[01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:42.896]  We all know that.
[01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:44.577]  Zach, thanks for popping in with us.
[01:04:44.597 --> 01:04:46.998]  Pop in for a full hour on Sunday if you can.
[01:04:47.038 --> 01:04:48.259]  I know you've got some time then.
[01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:55.603]  We'll be back with Leo Zegami, a real former member of the Illuminati, P2 Masonic Lodge, inside the Vatican.
[01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:59.965]  That's why he is the guy that, years before anybody else, laid out the entire blueprint.
[01:05:00.385 --> 01:05:02.166]  Next year's news today, InfoWars.
[01:05:04.022 --> 01:05:07.344]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[01:06:04.913 --> 01:06:05.754]  Good evening, everybody.
[01:06:08.539 --> 01:06:09.920]  There's not even the same universe.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.521]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[01:06:13.681 --> 01:06:20.803]  People around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[01:06:21.123 --> 01:06:21.924]  They're freaking out.
[01:06:22.524 --> 01:06:25.625]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.762]  What's different at this point, Doug, than me?
[01:06:33.882 --> 01:06:35.482]  I have two words for you.
[01:06:35.522 --> 01:06:37.743]  But you're drunk.
[01:06:56.743 --> 01:06:59.364]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:01.924]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:07:02.064 --> 01:07:05.005]  He said we smell like sulfur.
[01:07:05.105 --> 01:07:07.225]  Ain't that something?
[01:07:07.345 --> 01:07:09.626]  I'm not just being tacky.
[01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:12.326]  Call me Margaret Mead and Samoa.
[01:07:12.367 --> 01:07:19.228]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like that.
[01:07:36.044 --> 01:07:40.185]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:07:40.906 --> 01:07:42.446]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:42.546 --> 01:07:43.646]  There it is.
[01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:11.352]  There's a lot of flies in here, and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[01:08:11.632 --> 01:08:19.894]  We've all heard of Spider-Man, but what about Snyder Man, who calls the women that work for him brown slaves, reportedly, and roughs them up?
[01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:22.874]  There's nothing more liberal than that, I guess.
[01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:27.415]  ...investigation for more than four months into
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:45.048]  The Weinstein Company and our investigation, as demonstrated by the petition filed yesterday, uncovered a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment, intimidation, discrimination, and abuse at the Weinstein Company.
[01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:52.872]  This white mamba might be the one to save us.
[01:08:53.313 --> 01:08:57.215]  Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
[01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:15.827]  Have you forsaken us?
[01:09:16.007 --> 01:09:20.130]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:09:33.322 --> 01:09:37.246]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09:38.427 --> 01:09:43.091]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:49.148]  All right, we're already halfway into this segment, so I'm going to get our guest starting at the next segment.
[01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:56.131]  Best-selling author, been in a major branch of the Real Illuminati, P2, Masonic Lodge, all of that.
[01:09:56.651 --> 01:10:03.094]  Leo Zagami chronicled everything four, five, six years before it happened, just like he said it would happen.
[01:10:05.825 --> 01:10:06.165]  We're good to go.
[01:10:25.723 --> 01:10:36.273]  It's all coming up today, and I first wanted to get into how he got into all this, what he experienced, and then what he learned when he was trying to go into these different groups and try to actually do good.
[01:10:36.994 --> 01:10:38.696]  So, that is coming up with Leo Zagami.
[01:10:38.716 --> 01:10:41.659]  I've been listening to him for 13, 14 years.
[01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:43.420]  Been having him on for close to 10.
[01:10:44.081 --> 01:10:46.323]  Been with him and worked on projects in Rome.
[01:10:46.804 --> 01:10:48.385]  He's just got amazing contacts there.
[01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:54.105]  Some of what he told me and showed me later came true as well while I was there and it was off record.
[01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:57.987]  Maybe he'll talk about some of that, you know, three, four years later here with us today.
[01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:03.901]  And then, the last few segments for Leo Zegami, I tend to open the phones up for quick questions.
[01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:08.564]  Just a particular question about the Vatican, about different branches of the Illuminati.
[01:11:08.584 --> 01:11:16.450]  Because you've got all the fake Illuminati, and you've got all the rock stars saying that, you know, they're in it, or... I mean, what is the Illuminati for real?
[01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:22.534]  What does it come out of with Adam Weishaupt, the Ingolstadt University, Jesuit priest, all of that.
[01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:24.856]  We're going to be discussing it with Leo Zegami.
[01:11:26.445 --> 01:11:30.486]  Coming up in the next segment, powerful information, so please stay with us.
[01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:49.150]  Then after he leaves us, there is a major move worldwide to criminalize everything, get you into the criminal system, and when they spit you out, have the Democrats and similar labor parties, liberal parties all over the world,
[01:11:50.527 --> 01:11:59.689]  Legalize or quasi-legalize your felony background, but you can only work when you work through guilds or you work through unions they control.
[01:11:59.729 --> 01:12:14.333]  So I'm going to break down the move towards the criminal union, the unionization of criminals through the deep state, which is a final Illuminati plan, even if we go back to the Jacobins and the French Revolution.
[01:12:16.038 --> 01:12:22.001]  We've got the president of the National Bounty Hunter Association, one of the stars of Dog the Bounty Hunter Show, joining us.
[01:12:22.862 --> 01:12:34.208]  And we're going to walk through Google saying they won't take advertisements from bail bondsmen because it's used against minorities, just like Nicholas Cruz, the shooter from Parkland.
[01:12:35.849 --> 01:12:42.973]  For four and a half years, since early 2013, he could commit vandalism, crimes, physically attack people.
[01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:47.003]  Threatened to murder everyone on a routine basis.
[01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:51.264]  Until the FBI was called three times, the police 22 times.
[01:12:51.705 --> 01:12:55.286]  Then his foster parents, both in a year period, mysteriously died.
[01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:58.147]  He's on drugs in government care.
[01:12:59.447 --> 01:13:04.449]  And then he's released to go kill, and the Sheriff's Department, including the head resource officer, stands down.
[01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:09.911]  And then 10 other plus officers stand down, just as our witnesses we had on the day after reported.
[01:13:11.843 --> 01:13:13.865]  Again, let the Muslims rape whoever they want.
[01:13:13.945 --> 01:13:15.186]  I've got a stack of news on that.
[01:13:15.526 --> 01:13:16.127]  All over Europe.
[01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:16.567]  Finland.
[01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:19.369]  High court legalizing sex with 10-year-old children.
[01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.950]  Rape.
[01:13:22.032 --> 01:13:30.899]  See, once you're a protected class in the global order, if you're a criminal, you can carry it out as long as you pay your dues to them and are part of their system.
[01:13:30.919 --> 01:13:33.542]  So they're going into a final phase of lawlessness.
[01:13:34.909 --> 01:13:36.090]  Which has always been their plan.
[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:44.154]  Like Hillary's saying, black people are animals and need to be brought to heel and need to all be put in prison for three times longer for the same amount of cocaine as a white person.
[01:13:44.634 --> 01:13:51.958]  That's so they can put them in there, have them radicalize in the prisons under the globalist controlled Islamic movement, put chips on their shoulders, take them out.
[01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:56.760]  Not let them be productive members of the society until the next phase kicks in.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:05.665]  Be a strong man for the globalists under strong cities, under the UN, under the Democratic Party, and then you will have your crimes forgiven.
[01:14:06.345 --> 01:14:12.708]  You will be given amnesty, but like a gladiator, you've got to fight in the arena and win to get it.
[01:14:14.089 --> 01:14:16.210]  So they're forming the Legion of Doom.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:23.005]  So when I finally break that down later, we should take a few minutes from this breakdown and put it on that, because I think I just laid it out there pretty good.
[01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:27.189]  And I've figured out their operations from studying history, and you don't get that anywhere else.
[01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.110]  That's why they particularly want to shut us down.
[01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.251]  Now, I want to break here.
[01:14:31.432 --> 01:14:32.273]  We're listener-supported.
[01:14:33.214 --> 01:14:38.058]  And you stand with your will and your support and your strength against the globalists.
[01:14:38.579 --> 01:14:39.720]  And we make it easy to do.
[01:14:41.601 --> 01:14:50.828]  You talk about frustrating Soros, Hillary, the New World Order, the fact that they took all our sponsors, the fact that Google came after us, the fact that they banned us advertising online on most platforms.
[01:14:51.409 --> 01:14:52.970]  Got a big story on that coming out in the next few days.
[01:14:53.831 --> 01:15:06.201]  You still come to Infowarsstore.com or High Quality Shopping Cart online and get game-changing supplements, the top air filters, the top water filters at the lowest prices, non-GMO heirloom seeds, emergency shortwave radios, firearms accessories.

[01:15:21.831 --> 01:15:22.471]  So I'm doing it.

[01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:48.753]  It is next level.
[01:15:48.773 --> 01:15:48.993]  50% off.
[01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:49.793]  Bodies.
[01:15:50.173 --> 01:15:51.334]  This is only running for a week.
[01:15:51.734 --> 01:15:55.295]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:15:55.775 --> 01:15:57.736]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:15:57.996 --> 01:15:59.897]  If you haven't tried these products, you really should.
[01:16:00.217 --> 01:16:00.757]  We'll be back!
[01:16:03.443 --> 01:16:03.804]  Pardon me?
[01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:07.427]  I think you are full of conspiracies and I don't think that you are helping our country.
[01:16:07.467 --> 01:16:09.669]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[01:16:09.929 --> 01:16:12.932]  Like, give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[01:16:13.952 --> 01:16:15.454]  That water is making the frogs skate.
[01:16:18.337 --> 01:16:26.386]  It might look like we're out in a bush somewhere, but 15 feet on either side, we're surrounded by agriculture, and the runoff ends up in this river.
[01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:32.173]  All of the algae is the result of all the nutrients, because a lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture.
[01:16:32.613 --> 01:16:36.077]  And once those fertilizers get into the water, you get these blooms of algae.
[01:16:36.878 --> 01:16:42.643]  Our data so far suggests that the mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones.
[01:16:43.143 --> 01:16:49.428]  And those stress hormones cause immunosuppression, which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.
[01:16:49.448 --> 01:16:54.072]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:16:54.832 --> 01:16:59.376]  It seems that even the tough bullfrog isn't doing so well with the toxins in this water.
[01:17:05.515 --> 01:17:06.415]  I got a chant going.
[01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:08.416]  I got a chant going.
[01:17:08.816 --> 01:17:09.717]  What about gay frogs?
[01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:10.677]  It's not funny!
[01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:12.758]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[01:17:13.418 --> 01:17:14.498]  GAY FROGS!
[01:17:14.899 --> 01:17:19.040]  Hayes is testing the effects of chemicals like atrazine, a common herbicide.
[01:17:19.981 --> 01:17:24.362]  We have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.
[01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:25.923]  Specimen zero one.
[01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:36.014]  These animals that we know are genetic males have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life, and many of these genetic males now are turning into females.
[01:17:36.975 --> 01:17:46.199]  And quite frankly, if you're a genetic male, it'd be nice if you developed as a genetic male, and now we have a chemical very common in the environment that's effectively sex-reversing animals.
[01:17:46.699 --> 01:17:52.302]  Now obviously it's not fair to judge a guy on one isolated dumbass clip, so here's a bunch of them.
[01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:54.504]  Alex is anti-gay.
[01:17:54.964 --> 01:17:57.166]  He's saying the chemicals are making people gay.
[01:17:57.646 --> 01:17:59.648]  Folks, it's making the frogs gay.
[01:17:59.988 --> 01:18:03.291]  Two-thirds of the frogs down in Houston are bisexual.
[01:18:03.572 --> 01:18:05.133]  Do you understand that?
[01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.894]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:18:06.954 --> 01:18:07.675]  Boom, boom!
[01:18:07.715 --> 01:18:08.496]  Screw this crap!
[01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:17.584]  The one that's sort of remarkable is this pair.
[01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:20.598]  These are both males.
[01:18:21.159 --> 01:18:25.701]  The one on the bottom, acting as the female, we affectionately refer to as Darnell.
[01:18:26.441 --> 01:18:31.304]  He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female, he lays eggs like a female.
[01:18:32.224 --> 01:18:37.367]  He, she has been exposed to atrazine all of her, his, her life.
[01:18:37.387 --> 01:18:38.807]  I don't even really know how to reference it.
[01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:40.668]  This is Darnell's third clutch.
[01:18:41.248 --> 01:18:43.890]  So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.
[01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:45.871]  You can see eggs in the bottom.
[01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:48.313]  This is actually her second clutch for today.
[01:18:48.873 --> 01:18:52.476]  He or she has been copulating for getting close to 24 hours now.
[01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:57.560]  This is probably one of the most remarkable things I've seen in my work.
[01:18:58.621 --> 01:19:08.188]  Jones has argued that the government has the ability to control tornadoes, and that tap water is a gay bomb, and that they are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:10.430]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:11.751]  FROGS!
[01:19:14.273 --> 01:19:15.254]  I am worried.
[01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:18.956]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water.
[01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:26.760]  And the level of atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.101]  You know what?
[01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:31.863]  I guess it makes sense that Donald Trump wants to impress Alex Jones.
[01:19:32.143 --> 01:19:35.865]  Why would he want to drain the swamp if not to eradicate all those gay frogs?
[01:19:36.866 --> 01:19:37.646]  You stay there.
[01:19:37.866 --> 01:19:39.187]  You two stay where you are.
[01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:42.368]  It's not just a problem with frogs we should be concerned about.
[01:19:42.388 --> 01:19:47.089]  The water that's causing their problems is the same water that we're drinking and using to water our crops.
[01:20:06.445 --> 01:20:10.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.848 --> 01:20:30.069]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.109 --> 01:20:35.530]  Alright, Leo Zagami is our guest.
[01:20:36.767 --> 01:20:42.289]  And he's been just an incredible, accurate predictor, years ahead of time, of exactly what was going to happen in the Vatican.
[01:20:42.809 --> 01:20:44.289]  He's written a whole bunch of best-selling books.
[01:20:44.309 --> 01:20:45.810]  You can find them at leozugami.com.
[01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:51.311]  And he's, you know, exposed the Vatican Illuminati angle.
[01:20:51.551 --> 01:21:04.095]  And I think it's fair to say that he's been in one of the major subgroups, or actual internal group subgroups, of the classical Adam Weishaupt Illuminati that tells people you're getting into the empowerment of humanity,
[01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:05.115]  I don't
[01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:33.493]  Tell folks about yourself some, so they can understand how you've been able to predict there'd be two popes.
[01:21:33.713 --> 01:21:35.915]  That it'd be this particular Jesuit pope.
[01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:40.498]  That they would then attack the church and try to bring it down and call for open borders with Islam.
[01:21:40.518 --> 01:21:43.441]  Because clearly, you've proven yourself the last 15 years.
[01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:45.362]  That's why you've been under such attack.
[01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:47.644]  So let's talk some about Leo Zegami.
[01:21:48.264 --> 01:21:54.950]  Really Illuminati insider, by defining herself, what you would call the so-called globalist Illuminati.
[01:21:55.470 --> 01:22:00.232]  Versus the counterfeit of just people organically wanting real illumination.
[01:22:00.552 --> 01:22:02.152]  Give us your insider breakdown, please.
[01:22:03.713 --> 01:22:05.914]  Well, the two things are interconnected.
[01:22:06.034 --> 01:22:09.755]  In reality, Illuminati should stand for illumination.
[01:22:09.795 --> 01:22:18.498]  The problem is that once you have this illumination, it's very easy then to prevaricate on others and enslave others.
[01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:24.560]  So the problem is that you are tempted by those black forces and that black magic that
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:51.474]  Yeah, I mean, I was lucky enough to be born in a family that for more than a thousand years has been involved in such things because of bloodlines, both from my father's side and my mother's side in Sicily and in the UK, both in Scotland and in England.
[01:22:52.034 --> 01:23:04.303]  Where the aristocracy, as you know, still exists, and where we have a very different perspective from, of course, the classical approach you can have maybe in the U.S., where it's a very young country.
[01:23:04.923 --> 01:23:18.413]  But even in the U.S., as you know, certain bloodlines are cultivated in your universities, and the elite, of course, is part of certain secret societies, like the Skull and Bones, for example, that then bring up
[01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.233]  Thank you.
[01:23:49.216 --> 01:24:05.834]  It created for me at one point friction with certain organizations when I saw that the Vatican was not only indulging in Satanism, but promoting it and working within the New Age with these Jesuits actively.
[01:24:06.135 --> 01:24:10.920]  That's why the Jesuits are behind things like, for example,
[01:24:11.328 --> 01:24:25.234]  The World Council of Churches that is going to now organize this gathering in Geneva on the 21st of June with Pope Francis, which in the Illuminati calendar is a very important event, Alex, because
[01:24:25.839 --> 01:24:49.959]  Even myself, in my years in the Illuminati, in this organization, I was always dealing with ecumenical work, with the World Council of Churches, and the different branches of the various... And what you're saying is the heart of the Illuminati is the ecumenical movement to basically mix all religions together to bring down Christianity, which this new Pope is pushing a world religion.
[01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:58.587]  Specifically, describe the level of the Illuminati that you got into, the real Illuminati, and what that was like and what you discovered.
[01:24:58.847 --> 01:25:03.051]  Without getting into, I know you can't get into the secrets, but anything criminal you'd be forced to talk about.
[01:25:04.653 --> 01:25:04.893]  Of course.
[01:25:05.073 --> 01:25:12.279]  I mean, the secret might be the handshake or the password or the initiation and its contents, certain words.
[01:25:12.379 --> 01:25:23.988]  But in reality, the network that I've been part of had important members like Alicia Jelly, for example, Monte Carlo Loggi with Ezio Gioncchia.
[01:25:24.388 --> 01:25:27.791]  Comandante Giorgio Balestieri used to be in charge of the Rotary Club.
[01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:29.492]  In New York.
[01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:38.602]  And many other powerful figures connected to the Vatican Knights of Malta and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, because these are also part of the Illuminati.
[01:25:39.002 --> 01:25:42.907]  And then there is, of course, Giuliano Di Bernardo, Academy of the Illuminati.
[01:25:43.107 --> 01:25:46.650]  Of course, these organizations are not recruiting on the Internet, Alex.
[01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:48.753]  What you see recruiting on the Internet
[01:25:49.293 --> 01:25:50.354]  Often is a scam.
[01:25:50.634 --> 01:25:56.559]  And I want to warn, really, a lot of our viewers that these scams are increasing, unfortunately.
[01:25:56.659 --> 01:26:04.726]  And a lot of people send emails every day saying, I joined the Illuminati, I gave money to a Nigerian, and then he stole my money.
[01:26:05.587 --> 01:26:09.430]  I want to make you understand that there is no recruiting in the Illuminati.
[01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:12.252]  In the Illuminati, you are chosen and then brought.
[01:26:12.312 --> 01:26:14.134]  You can't ask to become an Illuminati.
[01:26:14.154 --> 01:26:16.376]  It's them who ask you to become one.
[01:26:17.009 --> 01:26:22.456]  And of course, they feel a great privilege because at that point, they know that they are in an elite club.
[01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:25.841]  When I was in the Monte Carlo Lodge, I was surrounded by people.
[01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:41.277]  And it's just like the Italian Mafia, that's why there's P2, there's Masonic Elements, there's La Cosa Nostra.
[01:26:41.577 --> 01:26:42.937]  But then it all ties together.
[01:26:42.957 --> 01:26:46.739]  They have yearly meetings in London with the Queen, who they see as the head of the whole thing.
[01:26:47.079 --> 01:26:49.760]  Still, even the Japanese come and give fealty to that.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.502]  But just to explain how this global system works, you've got famously people
[01:26:55.649 --> 01:26:55.970]  I don't know.
[01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:14.411]  Totally made up.
[01:27:14.672 --> 01:27:17.415]  You don't have an aristocratic background, or you don't have the bloodlines.
[01:27:17.615 --> 01:27:19.498]  You'll never get in the actual inner Illuminati.
[01:27:19.778 --> 01:27:23.803]  You can actually become a serbonaut, even in the military, or a lawyer, or proven you're loyal.
[01:27:24.284 --> 01:27:30.252]  But it's all a hierarchical system, a shadow aristocratic global eugenics program.
[01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:53.919]  Yeah, I mean, in the end, you see even people, I remember in Monte Carlo arriving with millions and millions, maybe nobody, people who had recently made money and they were, of course, kneeled down to aristocrats who were maybe bankrupt and just wanted their money to then give them a knighthood and then basically welcome them in this club, which is very exclusive.
[01:27:54.392 --> 01:28:06.962]  And now, for example, in Monte Carlo, they have a control system which basically controls this Priory of Zion, which is not the Priory of Zion of Dan Brown.
[01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:15.569]  It's basically an organization born in the beginning of the 50s out of a political right-wing ideology, anti-communist.
[01:28:17.318 --> 01:28:20.621]  That was involved with certain Knights Templars and Masonic groups.
[01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:34.554]  And this is now in Monte Carlo, controlling large branches of the Illuminati with the Supreme Council of the Illuminati, which is formed of four members, a quadrillion.
[01:28:36.923 --> 01:28:41.326]  And they make the initiations in the church, the Anglican Church in Monte Carlo.
[01:28:41.466 --> 01:28:42.046]  Imagine that!
[01:28:42.547 --> 01:28:43.907]  All right, Leo Zagami.
[01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:45.709]  I tell you, spot on information.
[01:28:46.209 --> 01:28:49.331]  We'll now jump forward from this and why he decided to go public.
[01:28:49.711 --> 01:29:00.378]  We'll lay out the latest moves in the Vatican, which are very frightening, really incredibly disastrous things happening, as this evil devil pope, false prophet, takes full control of the church.
[01:29:00.398 --> 01:29:00.798]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.039 --> 01:29:04.702]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[01:29:05.123 --> 01:29:10.249]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:13.874]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[01:29:14.294 --> 01:29:17.818]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:29.703]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[01:29:30.343 --> 01:29:41.086]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[01:29:41.386 --> 01:29:46.788]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:50.409]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.390]  It's a 360 win.
[01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:58.052]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[01:29:58.333 --> 01:29:59.693]  So please go to the site now.
[01:30:00.133 --> 01:30:01.714]  We need your support.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:11.662]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their hammerlock, their complete monopoly on political discourse in this country.
[01:30:11.982 --> 01:30:23.526]  Donald Trump's election, in fact the entire sea change in American politics, was only made possible through a robust and vibrant alternative media allowed through an unfettered internet.
[01:30:23.866 --> 01:30:43.713]  This is not only about the 2016 and 2020 elections, it's about the slow motion coup that's going on in this country, where a fabricated dossier can be used to justify legally the illegal surveillance, the unconstitutional surveillance on the Republican candidate for President of the United States.
[01:30:43.993 --> 01:30:52.176]  But you see, those who are the perps in that crime don't want any discussion of that crime in the mainstream or the alternative media.
[01:30:52.216 --> 01:30:59.999]  And that is why they seek, through a very, I think, duplicitous strategy of lawfare,
[01:31:00.939 --> 01:31:03.480]  And censorship to shut us down.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:15.424]  The key to this, of course, is the lawsuits, and I'm facing one from an Obama-blessed Front Call Project democracy, who are suing me and Donald Trump.
[01:31:15.724 --> 01:31:20.046]  The allegation being that we worked with the Russians to hack
[01:31:20.866 --> 01:31:24.627]  Uh, the Democratic National Committee and give that material to WikiLeaks.
[01:31:24.787 --> 01:31:30.709]  That is as unprovable in a court of law as it will be unprovable in the court of public opinion.
[01:31:30.989 --> 01:31:32.570]  Because it's a fairy tale.
[01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.870]  A falsehood.
[01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:35.151]  A lie.
[01:31:35.591 --> 01:31:36.411]  A canard.
[01:31:36.811 --> 01:31:39.092]  A steaming plate of, well, you know.
[01:31:40.192 --> 01:31:54.044]  The point here, of course, is that if they can silence us, if they can take us off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, it becomes much easier to drive their false narrative about the 2016 election.
[01:31:55.285 --> 01:32:13.424]  They're false narrative about the unconstitutional activities going on today, whether it is raiding Donald Trump's lawyer's office or whether it is the illegal surveillance of the Republican candidate for president under FISA warrants that were fabricated in their rationale, fabricated in their purpose.
[01:32:13.845 --> 01:32:16.568]  And then, of course, there's the Second Amendment.
[01:32:17.228 --> 01:32:21.571]  Silence us before you attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights.
[01:32:22.132 --> 01:32:22.912]  This is a struggle.
[01:32:23.112 --> 01:32:25.794]  This is the single most important struggle.
[01:32:26.215 --> 01:32:26.515]  Why?
[01:32:26.575 --> 01:32:35.081]  Because without our voice, all other issues, trade, immigration, the economy, we are at an enormous disadvantage.
[01:32:35.521 --> 01:32:38.764]  The real story here is that the American left
[01:32:39.224 --> 01:32:41.806]  No longer is interested in dialogue or debate.
[01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:43.808]  They can't win a debate.
[01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.529]  They don't want a debate.
[01:32:45.829 --> 01:32:47.671]  They don't want a discussion of issues.
[01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:54.717]  Their answer when we raise facts and arguments is silence them, censor them, close them down.
[01:32:55.157 --> 01:32:57.799]  That's why you know they have lost.
[01:32:58.299 --> 01:32:58.680]  Thank you.
[01:33:05.866 --> 01:33:08.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.365 --> 01:33:30.491]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:33.334]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.059 --> 01:33:52.250]  The toll-free number to join us to ask a question of Leo Zegami on the Illuminati, the total coming out of evil happening at the Vatican, you name it, is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:33:52.531 --> 01:34:00.035]  No matter how much it makes most Catholics upset, no matter how much it hurts them, this Pope is going for broke.
[01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:03.317]  And if you want to understand the Illuminati religion, they believe they're going to become
[01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:24.371]  But they have to transcend humanity and create a cataclysm and carry out Armageddon themselves against humanity to then merge with machines and transcend this social Darwinistic battle of the gods or Guter Dameron, Ragnarok.
[01:34:26.992 --> 01:34:30.233]  And so you see pathos in the Associated Press and everybody making fun of me.
[01:34:30.653 --> 01:34:32.814]  Alex Jones invents a new boogeyman for Trump to fight.
[01:34:34.733 --> 01:34:44.420]  Well, three days after I said that, Trump announced that he's having a big meeting coming up about the dangers of AI displacing humans, robots, how they've built an anti-human future.
[01:34:46.022 --> 01:34:47.763]  I mean, I knew the president was concerned about this.
[01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:52.627]  Because the decision had been made to build this new anti-human future, this depopulation.
[01:34:54.368 --> 01:34:56.810]  So they make the jokes about all these serious things.
[01:34:57.190 --> 01:34:58.531]  We'll tie that into it as well.
[01:34:58.591 --> 01:35:00.653]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:35:02.005 --> 01:35:03.346]  877-789-2539.
[01:35:03.607 --> 01:35:05.349]  First time callers, by the way.
[01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:08.712]  And I'm asking just a quick, clear question so I get a lot of people in.
[01:35:10.134 --> 01:35:11.555]  We'll have two little segments after that.
[01:35:12.316 --> 01:35:13.177]  So, again, that's the number.
[01:35:13.197 --> 01:35:13.438]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:16.601]  Now, just condensing this, the 33,000 foot view now, looking at this,
[01:35:22.153 --> 01:35:24.996]  From your inside perspective, where is it going?
[01:35:25.496 --> 01:35:27.138]  Correct me if you think I'm wrong about my statements.
[01:35:27.879 --> 01:35:32.023]  What's happening with the takeover of the entire church apparatus by the Jesuits?
[01:35:32.363 --> 01:35:36.728]  And what do you expect to happen next, as you've made so many absolutely on-target predictions?
[01:35:38.865 --> 01:35:41.748]  Well, you're absolutely right regarding artificial intelligence.
[01:35:41.808 --> 01:35:53.520]  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised about Donald J. Trump's stand after, on Sunday, I made my first public speech in English language, partly based on this dangerous, dangerous subject, which is the AI.
[01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:54.521]  Yes.
[01:36:11.795 --> 01:36:20.658]  Want to empower these machines because, as you said, then they will upload their own soul into them because they are demonic.
[01:36:20.678 --> 01:36:22.138]  They are based on matter.
[01:36:22.419 --> 01:36:26.940]  And so that's where they're going towards the complete control of matter.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.321]  But in the process, of course, they are losing the spirit.
[01:36:30.681 --> 01:36:35.663]  And of course, their own connection with God, because they are completely satanic.
[01:36:35.963 --> 01:36:38.944]  And Pope Francis in Geneva is going to outline
[01:36:39.574 --> 01:36:42.455]  His own program for the One World Religion.
[01:36:42.975 --> 01:36:44.336]  And this is no joke.
[01:36:44.416 --> 01:37:01.702]  I mean, this is the final stage of something that already John Paul II started when he went to Geneva also and said that the ecumenism path we are following is irreversible and we are going towards something, of course, that is going to unite us all.
[01:37:02.162 --> 01:37:03.142]  What does this mean?
[01:37:03.162 --> 01:37:07.524]  It means that they are destroying Christianity
[01:37:07.924 --> 01:37:10.945]  Because they want to embrace every other religion.
[01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:20.227]  In the meantime, they are, of course, using Islam as their Trojan horse to destroy the West and to destroy the last remains of Christianity.
[01:37:20.307 --> 01:37:28.590]  I was, as I said, in England and in London last weekend, and there were three stabbings, one murder.
[01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:34.231]  Actually, one kid was murdered, a 17-year-old child killed.
[01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:36.632]  Another one, 13 and 15-year-old, were brutally
[01:37:38.913 --> 01:37:46.739]  And this is happening in London, a city where I lived many years in peace, that now is starting to employ private policemen.
[01:37:46.839 --> 01:37:52.923]  And that is the thing, Alex, that is going to distinguish the future citizens of mankind.
[01:37:53.003 --> 01:37:58.507]  Because the Illuminati have the money and the resources to employ these mercenaries and these private police.
[01:37:58.807 --> 01:37:59.367]  We don't.
[01:37:59.547 --> 01:38:01.489]  The poor people will be on one side.
[01:38:02.069 --> 01:38:03.269]  We're good to go.
[01:38:31.803 --> 01:38:43.836]  The moment I stepped off the plane, I could only see the images of Trump criticized by the British TV on his stand on weapons, criticizing London and what is happening in London.
[01:38:44.176 --> 01:38:52.746]  They didn't talk about their own problem, which is, of course, what Trump said was confirmed during the weekend while I was there.
[01:38:53.286 --> 01:39:07.257]  So, I think that we need to outline the hypocrisy of these people that live surrounded by big high fences, electric fences, and of course with the mercenaries defending them.
[01:39:07.677 --> 01:39:10.119]  And the Pope is the same kind of subject.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:18.446]  He criticizes the weapons, but then he has the highest... he criticizes wars, then he has the highest wars, and he has the most lethal weapons.
[01:39:18.766 --> 01:39:30.876]  I mean, this is complete hypocrisy and of course they are going towards implementing this hypocrisy because they feel that people are brainwashed enough to accept all this.
[01:39:31.217 --> 01:39:42.566]  Thanks to InfoWars, thanks to the alternative media, Drudge Report and so on, we have a possibility and this possibility has to empower us with the resistance.
[01:39:43.347 --> 01:39:44.108]  When I see
[01:39:44.668 --> 01:39:55.472]  That the head of the World Council of Religions is criticizing the religious right and he is basically politicizing religion.
[01:39:56.253 --> 01:40:00.594]  This demonstrates that they want to push the liberal ideology.
[01:40:00.814 --> 01:40:04.356]  They want to embrace as many immigrants as they can in Europe.
[01:40:05.126 --> 01:40:10.972]  But it's obvious that the situation is becoming more and more dangerous every day.
[01:40:10.992 --> 01:40:16.238]  In Italy, in the last week, a group of Nigerians attacked an Italian in the street.
[01:40:16.958 --> 01:40:28.110]  Then we had a group of gypsies entering a bar and then beating up even an handicapped person in a bar in Rome.
[01:40:29.271 --> 01:40:32.593]  We have a situation which is completely out of control.
[01:40:32.653 --> 01:40:34.975]  There is... And what is the endgame?
[01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:43.982]  Because the globalists on record kept the third world poor, neutralized them being industrialized, now they're openly flooding, where the tourism is almost dead everywhere.
[01:40:44.022 --> 01:40:45.223]  It's all just hellish.
[01:40:45.603 --> 01:40:49.226]  I was over in Rome three years ago and it was just like, it totally changed.
[01:40:49.566 --> 01:40:50.987]  People crapping all over the street.
[01:40:51.908 --> 01:40:53.669]  Every tree had like 30 people under it.
[01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:56.992]  Just bizarre, just hordes spilling over.
[01:40:57.932 --> 01:40:59.973]  Towns collapsing, just insanity.
[01:41:02.294 --> 01:41:11.899]  Their process was outlined by the ideology of this Count Calergi that 100 years ago basically planned.
[01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:21.404]  He was one of the people who gave birth to this pan-European movement to the basis of the EU and then his plan is to mix all the races
[01:41:22.064 --> 01:41:24.086]  He himself was half Japanese.
[01:41:24.106 --> 01:41:27.590]  He had a bit of problems in the society back then.
[01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:28.931]  Very Eritrean.
[01:41:28.971 --> 01:41:35.016]  And again, slowly tell folks about that European Royal and the plans.
[01:41:35.137 --> 01:41:36.278]  It's even on Wikipedia.
[01:41:36.798 --> 01:41:44.002]  To forcibly merge Europe with the rest of the planet to build this utopia, which Europe has now adopted.
[01:41:44.022 --> 01:41:46.504]  And of course, he was one of the founders of the Olympics as well.
[01:41:46.844 --> 01:41:48.045]  Hitler believed in this plan.
[01:41:48.345 --> 01:41:49.986]  People heard that Hitler was going to exterminate everybody.
[01:41:50.046 --> 01:41:51.007]  No, just certain groups.
[01:41:51.987 --> 01:41:53.068]  Tell folks about that plan again.
[01:41:54.949 --> 01:41:57.871]  Their plan is to destroy the ethnicity.
[01:41:58.011 --> 01:41:59.932]  Sure, but the name of the plan, so people can Google it.
[01:42:00.953 --> 01:42:03.194]  The plan is called Calergy Plan.
[01:42:03.534 --> 01:42:04.675]  It's K-A-L-E-R-G-Y.
[01:42:05.485 --> 01:42:07.586]  L.E.R.G.I.
[01:42:08.006 --> 01:42:08.747]  Calergi.
[01:42:09.727 --> 01:42:19.351]  And it's named after Count Calergi, who is also a guy after who we have an award which is given every year.
[01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:24.973]  And of course, they have given this award to people like Pope Francis and Angela Merkel, amongst others.
[01:42:25.634 --> 01:42:25.714]  And
[01:42:26.654 --> 01:42:27.595]  Do you think
[01:42:44.457 --> 01:42:48.419]  They will, with the artificial intelligence, control everything.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.101]  They still need some slaves to do the ordinary work.
[01:42:52.362 --> 01:42:54.383]  But they definitely don't need any problem.
[01:42:54.583 --> 01:42:58.985]  So the destruction of sovereignty and then the destruction of ethnicity is fundamental.
[01:42:59.005 --> 01:42:59.386]  That's right.
[01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:00.206]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:00.266 --> 01:43:00.706]  Amazing.
[01:43:00.726 --> 01:43:01.287]  Leo Zegami.
[01:43:02.558 --> 01:43:03.999]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:44:07.031 --> 01:44:10.132]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:44:10.172 --> 01:44:10.692]  You're on the air.
[01:44:10.712 --> 01:44:11.852]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:11.892 --> 01:44:12.712]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:44:12.932 --> 01:44:13.532]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:13.832 --> 01:44:14.212]  Good, man.
[01:44:14.232 --> 01:44:15.032]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:15.112 --> 01:44:15.673]  Hey, hey.
[01:44:15.773 --> 01:44:20.173]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:20.393 --> 01:44:26.754]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Violent Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:26.774 --> 01:44:28.595]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:44:28.675 --> 01:44:34.836]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:35.896 --> 01:44:37.116]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:37.176 --> 01:44:41.178]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:41.578 --> 01:44:43.179]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:43.619 --> 01:44:44.379]  And exactly.
[01:44:44.399 --> 01:44:48.681]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:48.981 --> 01:44:49.241]  Boom!
[01:44:49.401 --> 01:44:52.222]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:52.282 --> 01:44:52.802]  It's amazing.
[01:44:52.882 --> 01:44:57.104]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:02.398 --> 01:45:06.741]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:12.365]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[01:45:12.965 --> 01:45:15.647]  Now the product is BODY's Whole Body Support.
[01:45:15.948 --> 01:45:21.211]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:21.251 --> 01:45:24.934]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[01:45:25.805 --> 01:45:33.570]  It's got the black pepper which makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:40.814]  Now we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:46.037]  People have been taking turmeric and noticed elevated moods, increased energy,
[01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:52.625]  And that's aside from all the other factors, all the other benefits that we're talking about in this promo.
[01:45:52.785 --> 01:45:53.626]  It's 50% off.
[01:45:53.666 --> 01:45:56.350]  And as I said, I was taking turmeric anyway.
[01:45:57.316 --> 01:45:58.297]  It's curcumin.
[01:45:58.537 --> 01:46:00.138]  It's the powder used in curry.
[01:46:00.499 --> 01:46:02.460]  You know, you wouldn't be able to take it naturally.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:08.165]  It'd make you sneeze and cough, but we've got it in a 120-capsule bottle right here.
[01:46:08.205 --> 01:46:10.047]  Just got this fresh shipped in today.
[01:46:10.067 --> 01:46:11.988]  There's an article in Spectator Health.
[01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:19.475]  The article reads, daily consumption of curcumin improves the memory and mood of people with mild age-related memory loss, according to a new study.
[01:46:20.433 --> 01:46:22.936]  By the University of California in Los Angeles.
[01:46:23.536 --> 01:46:29.642]  Found in turmeric, curcumin has previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in lab studies.
[01:46:30.243 --> 01:46:35.849]  It's also been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in India where curcumin is a dietary staple
[01:46:36.529 --> 01:46:38.950]  Again, because it's in all the cooking, in all the curries.
[01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:43.232]  I have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's and better cognitive performance.
[01:46:43.592 --> 01:46:44.573]  I take it anyway.
[01:46:44.733 --> 01:46:46.373]  So I just got this fresh today.
[01:46:46.493 --> 01:46:48.534]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.
[01:46:48.774 --> 01:46:49.034]  It's just $29.95.
[01:46:49.214 --> 01:46:52.496]  Again, big, big chunky bottle.
[01:46:52.516 --> 01:46:54.056]  120 capsules in this bottle.
[01:46:54.657 --> 01:46:58.959]  It is BODYS, the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.
[01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.780]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.320]  Get it today.
[01:47:06.832 --> 01:47:09.595]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.802]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[01:47:39.052 --> 01:47:43.194]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:43.234 --> 01:47:45.255]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:47:45.515 --> 01:47:47.896]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com are the main sites.
[01:47:48.256 --> 01:47:56.659]  LeoZagami.com is his amazing site.
[01:48:09.269 --> 01:48:14.197]  Here's an article he wrote for Infowars four years ago, three years ago.
[01:48:14.217 --> 01:48:18.163]  Report EU intentionally collapsing European countries with illegals.
[01:48:18.384 --> 01:48:23.071]  The Kalergi plan started in the 70s but dreamed up in the 20s.
[01:48:24.249 --> 01:48:28.592]  And you can read all about it at Infowars.com.
[01:48:29.272 --> 01:48:30.893]  Absolutely vital to know that.
[01:48:31.394 --> 01:48:33.695]  Now, I see some callers that disagree.
[01:48:33.715 --> 01:48:34.436]  We'll go to them first.
[01:48:34.536 --> 01:48:40.140]  Frank in California, Eric in Canada, William in Florida, Marshall, a bunch of others.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.421]  We're getting your calls up on the board.
[01:48:42.922 --> 01:48:44.823]  Not all of these disagree, but I see a few that disagree.
[01:48:46.044 --> 01:48:49.826]  Frank asks, how do we know Leo is not still a Mason and giving us disinfo?
[01:48:49.846 --> 01:48:50.747]  Well, let's stop right there.
[01:48:52.273 --> 01:48:53.014]  It's the weirdest thing.
[01:48:53.034 --> 01:48:56.276]  I'm like on Discovery Channel and History Channel with shows about the Masons.
[01:48:56.936 --> 01:49:01.959]  I talk about how a lot of the founders were Masons, and I had grandfathers and great-grandfathers, great-grandfathers.
[01:49:02.039 --> 01:49:03.300]  One of them was like a 33rd degree Mason.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:04.681]  Texas was founded by Masons.
[01:49:04.721 --> 01:49:05.601]  They were good people.
[01:49:06.622 --> 01:49:11.825]  George Washington was a Mason, but he wrote about the Illuminati and BISOP, and his letters are at the Library of Congress.
[01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:12.726]  You can look them up online.
[01:49:13.066 --> 01:49:14.307]  Read them in HD, written by him.
[01:49:15.461 --> 01:49:17.142]  And he sounds like Leo Zegami, sounds like me.
[01:49:17.222 --> 01:49:22.165]  So there's these movements of enlightenment, if you know what all this goes back to, and it goes back to the old universities.
[01:49:22.225 --> 01:49:23.766]  They were just secret societies.
[01:49:24.527 --> 01:49:26.668]  And then you have this evil force trying to take them over.
[01:49:26.688 --> 01:49:27.748]  There's always been good and bad.
[01:49:28.429 --> 01:49:31.251]  So this is more of an aristocratic thing we're discussing.
[01:49:31.511 --> 01:49:34.553]  What matters is Zegami's been accurately predicting these things.
[01:49:35.053 --> 01:49:37.835]  He admits he was brought up and came into all this.
[01:49:38.475 --> 01:49:42.998]  And so the way people always change the subject online, we don't do this, is infighting.
[01:49:43.678 --> 01:49:46.839]  Who cares if he was a really bad guy, and I've met him, and I think he's a good guy.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.180]  He's maternal, so have I. Nobody's perfect.
[01:49:50.401 --> 01:49:53.742]  But, you judge a tree by its fruits, but it's like, what are you going to do with the info?
[01:49:54.182 --> 01:49:54.903]  Did Zogami?
[01:49:55.814 --> 01:49:57.435]  Hey Alex, Leo, how are you guys doing today?
[01:49:57.455 --> 01:49:59.557]  Yeah, basically you already threw it all out, Alex.
[01:50:26.311 --> 01:50:43.925]  I am still a Freemason, but Freemasonry is not a Unitarian force.
[01:50:44.365 --> 01:50:46.407]  I'm on the Christian side of Freemasonry.
[01:50:46.447 --> 01:50:47.327]  I have my own order.
[01:50:47.367 --> 01:50:48.408]  I'm very open about it.
[01:50:48.448 --> 01:50:49.629]  I write books about it.
[01:50:49.649 --> 01:50:53.252]  I've published dozens of these books all over the world.
[01:50:53.872 --> 01:51:16.535]  So I don't think that I'm being secretive about my Masonic membership, but also my world within it, and the controversies that have brought me out of certain lodges, against certain people, and even receive an accusation of espionage and being arrested in Oslo, Norway, because of all this war that I am conducting, when I came out in the open with certain names.
[01:51:17.576 --> 01:51:22.261]  I've been always very transparent and you can find all this information in my books.
[01:51:22.501 --> 01:51:29.787]  So I invite people to just go and read them and see that I always be open about what I'm doing.
[01:51:29.807 --> 01:51:35.553]  As an answer to his question, the Masonic Order is just an ancient school predating Solomon.
[01:51:35.913 --> 01:51:37.594]  Solomon was the wisest man in the world.
[01:51:37.674 --> 01:51:41.038]  His father was King David, the man who's own heart.
[01:51:42.339 --> 01:51:47.265]  All this secretive stuff, though, just breeds, you know, globalism, New World Order.
[01:51:47.285 --> 01:51:48.466]  We're here exposing it.
[01:51:49.147 --> 01:51:49.848]  That's the whole point.
[01:51:50.489 --> 01:51:53.032]  And so he's going to do more good inside of it than outside of it.
[01:51:53.252 --> 01:51:55.655]  And again, the average Mason is what they call a porch Mason.
[01:51:55.675 --> 01:51:59.119]  They're not aware that the whole orders, most of the orders have been taken over.
[01:51:59.159 --> 01:51:59.800]  Correct, Leo?
[01:52:00.871 --> 01:52:01.491]  Absolutely.
[01:52:01.531 --> 01:52:03.333]  Porch Mason or Window Mason.
[01:52:03.373 --> 01:52:09.777]  Somebody that stands at the window of an institution that they barely know, or they participate in a social way.
[01:52:09.797 --> 01:52:14.860]  There is a lot of good masons that do a lot of good for people all over the United States.
[01:52:15.541 --> 01:52:25.167]  So we need to really recover our relation with the good side of Freemasonry, that unfortunately, like all the other institutions, Alex, have been... Exactly.
[01:52:25.227 --> 01:52:30.731]  It's the Illuminati that tells you the masons are all bad, so good people desert it, and then the evil can take it over.
[01:52:31.992 --> 01:52:36.475]  Yeah, the evil has taken over, especially in certain states like Colorado.
[01:52:36.535 --> 01:52:45.760]  Freemasonry is in the hands of liberals that let Muslims take over the lodges, teach all kinds of... Absolutely, and that's what they did to get Christians out of it.
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:50.903]  They exposed some of the arms of it that are Luciferian, because before it was colleges.
[01:52:51.224 --> 01:52:52.685]  You had to get in the secret society to be in the college.
[01:52:52.705 --> 01:52:55.987]  They didn't just give you mathematics to anybody, so you had to be sworn into the order.
[01:52:57.007 --> 01:52:59.048]  Back when colleges were partly religious.
[01:52:59.088 --> 01:53:01.288]  So of course they've all got those ancient myths.
[01:53:01.628 --> 01:53:02.568]  Mithra, all of it.
[01:53:02.968 --> 01:53:04.669]  Saturn, Saturnalia, all of that.
[01:53:04.909 --> 01:53:08.870]  But the thing is Christians, by the Middle Ages, were running it.
[01:53:09.570 --> 01:53:13.291]  And then now you've deserted it, as Washington said, and the whole thing's falling apart.
[01:53:13.531 --> 01:53:16.712]  And now it is the total darkness, the anti-Illuminati.
[01:53:16.892 --> 01:53:17.532]  Frank, anything else?
[01:53:19.541 --> 01:53:25.045]  No, I've been listening to both of you guys since about, well, you Alex, since about 2003.
[01:53:25.125 --> 01:53:29.107]  I don't think Leo got on until a little bit after that, but appreciate the answer.
[01:53:29.228 --> 01:53:42.236]  And I guess one more question is, so, you know, like you said, doing things in darkness versus doing things in light, you know, secret society versus open society.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.163]  Leo, any comment on that?
[01:53:48.224 --> 01:53:54.329]  I was told by a high-level Mason when I was a kid on a hunting trip, one of the head guys in Dallas, he said, don't join it, it's been taken over, it's no longer what it was.
[01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:57.632]  And by then the takeover had pretty much been complete.
[01:53:57.752 --> 01:54:00.675]  I know about the New World Order and the Illuminati from Masons.
[01:54:01.315 --> 01:54:03.718]  And that's what Zagami's telling you, correct Zagami?
[01:54:04.895 --> 01:54:15.944]  Yeah, and I think that, as I said, in my books I've been very open about how these things happened, about the fact that we are living in an age where I myself don't believe in secrecy anymore.
[01:54:16.004 --> 01:54:30.476]  I think this secrecy might mislead also the idea of remasonry of certain groups, also Illuminati sects, that need to be open about their endeavors, because then we can understand if they're really on the good side or the bad side.
[01:54:30.516 --> 01:54:30.776]  That's right.
[01:54:30.936 --> 01:54:31.817]  All right, Frank, thank you.
[01:54:31.877 --> 01:54:32.598]  Real quick, Eric.
[01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:35.894]  Let's go to Eric in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:36.995 --> 01:54:37.495]  Hey, how are you?
[01:54:37.855 --> 01:54:38.455]  Good, sir, go ahead.
[01:54:39.476 --> 01:54:47.240]  I just wanted to ask, well, based on what Jordan Maxwell said, he said in 1871, the United States was no longer united, it was divided because of the war.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:53.623]  In Delaware, they made it a corporation, and that we don't get to elect, they select for us.
[01:54:54.343 --> 01:55:00.226]  So, I want to know why he, if he thinks that left-hand paths Freemasons have selected Trump and put him in power.
[01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:09.398]  I mean, I personally think that Trump has the Jacobin, Satanic, Luciferian, anti-progressive.
[01:55:09.678 --> 01:55:11.699]  They call themselves the progressive because they're anti-progressive.
[01:55:12.899 --> 01:55:14.320]  Trump is a Renaissance force.
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:18.482]  They are an anti-Renaissance force, a Satanic force in the main.
[01:55:19.042 --> 01:55:21.483]  But I think Trump is, you know, obviously a worldly person.
[01:55:21.503 --> 01:55:22.564]  I think he's influenced by both.
[01:55:22.844 --> 01:55:24.564]  His great sin is he wants prosperity.
[01:55:24.825 --> 01:55:25.885]  He's not anti-human.
[01:55:26.285 --> 01:55:27.726]  What's your view on that, Leo Zegami?
[01:55:28.797 --> 01:55:36.124]  Well, from the inside, I can tell you that only the conservative and Christian side of Freemasons and Illuminati supports Donald J. Trump.
[01:55:36.224 --> 01:55:40.508]  It is a growing side, though, because a lot of Masons are finally coming out.
[01:55:40.889 --> 01:55:49.037]  But at the same time, here in Italy, there have been Freemasons that are coming out in support of Trump, even if he's a foreign president.
[01:55:49.537 --> 01:55:51.358]  Got punished within their lodges.
[01:55:51.398 --> 01:55:58.622]  This happened in the Grand Lodge of Italy, in the lodge, the two lodges they have in London, which operate abroad.
[01:55:58.703 --> 01:55:59.463]  Absolutely.
[01:55:59.483 --> 01:56:02.765]  Look, the power structure is coming after me big time for supporting Trump.
[01:56:02.785 --> 01:56:06.747]  And you see things turning around with him because he really is trying to be good.
[01:56:06.767 --> 01:56:07.648]  I think that's self-evident.
[01:56:07.688 --> 01:56:08.228]  Thank you, Eric.
[01:56:08.929 --> 01:56:10.469]  Let's jam in one more before we go to break here.
[01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:11.930]  We'll do one more segment with Leo Zegami.
[01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:13.031]  Got to have him back soon.
[01:56:13.911 --> 01:56:15.132]  Let's talk to William in Florida.
[01:56:15.152 --> 01:56:15.913]  You're on the air with Leo.
[01:56:15.933 --> 01:56:16.173]  Go ahead.
[01:56:18.356 --> 01:56:19.257]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:19.297 --> 01:56:20.258]  Good afternoon, Leo.
[01:56:20.638 --> 01:56:44.600]  My question is about, because Leo knows the bloodlines of the aristocracy, is there a possibility that somebody's out there with either Persian or basically coming from the Muslim side of the house and the Anglo side of the house that can be brought up to perhaps bring Israel and the Middle East into a state of peace?
[01:56:45.464 --> 01:56:49.566]  Oh, some new Abrahamic covenant to fix the old breach?
[01:56:49.606 --> 01:56:53.369]  I think they're planning two world wars, more world wars, to have us all destroy each other.
[01:56:53.409 --> 01:56:53.869]  But, Leah?
[01:56:55.848 --> 01:57:01.350]  Well, there is, for example, a Grand Lodge of Iran operating in exile.
[01:57:01.851 --> 01:57:14.976]  The problem with this Grand Lodge of Iran, which is a minority of a few hundred members, not more, is that at the moment they've been largely influenced by liberals and by democrats.
[01:57:15.317 --> 01:57:18.298]  In fact, they operate mainly from California.
[01:57:19.095 --> 01:57:25.478]  So they will not be really, I think, the right solution for Iran, for example.
[01:57:26.219 --> 01:57:34.943]  When they criticize today Trump for being so harsh with Iran, we have to remember that his policies with North Korea gave great results.
[01:57:35.323 --> 01:57:38.545]  So we need to operate the same policies also with Iran.
[01:57:39.526 --> 01:57:40.348]  Hold on, hold on, Leo.
[01:57:40.368 --> 01:57:41.309]  We gotta come to a break.
[01:57:41.349 --> 01:57:41.730]  Two minutes.
[01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:42.151]  We're back.
[01:57:42.191 --> 01:57:42.832]  William, stay there.
[01:57:42.852 --> 01:57:44.255]  I'll let you have a comeback to that.
[01:57:44.275 --> 01:57:46.419]  A few more calls on the other side with Leo Zegami.
[01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:47.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:49.144]  Third hour starts in just two minutes.
[01:57:49.204 --> 01:57:51.448]  Please spread the word on every station you're listening.
[01:58:42.025 --> 01:58:46.847]  You always thought you could put an air press on nails because of all the active things you do?
[01:58:47.448 --> 01:58:49.529]  Recolored in seven luscious hues.
[01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:56.152]  Just... Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:58:56.192 --> 01:59:01.515]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:59:01.915 --> 01:59:03.636]  These signals being sent through time.
[01:59:06.337 --> 01:59:08.319]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:59:08.899 --> 01:59:12.042]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[01:59:12.942 --> 01:59:18.126]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[01:59:18.747 --> 01:59:27.594]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[01:59:28.174 --> 01:59:33.439]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[01:59:34.019 --> 01:59:39.341]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[01:59:39.942 --> 01:59:41.983]  Only you can defeat the Globalist.
[01:59:42.243 --> 01:59:43.123]  We're in this together.
[01:59:43.143 --> 01:59:47.625]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[01:59:47.725 --> 01:59:55.949]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:59.990]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:12.875 --> 02:00:16.898]  When I grow up, I don't want to see the planet turn into a technocracy.
[02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:39.253]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:39.673 --> 02:00:41.975]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.563 --> 02:00:47.026]  Alright, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:47.046 --> 02:00:47.926]  I've got an article here.
[02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:53.432]  Catholic University opens sex-segregated prayer space for Muslim students.
[02:00:54.433 --> 02:01:01.599]  And I've got a whole stack of news here where Muslims can rape girls in places like Finland and the high court says it's okay.
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:03.942]  Leo Zagami is our guest.
[02:01:04.861 --> 02:01:05.902]  Take a few more calls.
[02:01:06.382 --> 02:01:07.343]  I want to go to this caller.
[02:01:07.403 --> 02:01:09.665]  Is there any sign of resistance to the Pope within the church?
[02:01:09.685 --> 02:01:16.571]  But briefly, how does the Orthodox Church and what's happening inside Russia tie into the whole global system, Leo?
[02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:19.150]  No, very much.
[02:01:19.290 --> 02:01:36.754]  Because within the World Council of Churches, they never really managed to pin under their control Kirill, the Patriarch of Russia, and basically that Orthodox faction which takes their orders from Moscow.
[02:01:37.014 --> 02:01:43.875]  Because the Orthodox tradition is mostly autonomous, Alex, but is divided in three main factions.
[02:01:44.455 --> 02:01:53.401]  One is under Istanbul, Constantinople and Bartolomeo I. Then there is Daniel in Romania and then we have Kirill in Russia.
[02:01:53.942 --> 02:02:13.815]  And they had a lot of squabbles between each other because each one of course is close geopolitically to the spheres of influence that of course on one side is Russia and in the last few years of course the controversy with NATO which supports Bartolomeo and Daniel from Romania.
[02:02:14.475 --> 02:02:31.459]  We have actually a fight within the Orthodox Church, but we can say that Kirill from Russia is definitely the only independent Christian at the moment who is not subject to the influence of the World Council of Churches.
[02:02:31.559 --> 02:02:36.420]  Though he's starting to have some relationship with Pope Francis,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:43.888]  And of course they came together in Cuba and later on, more and more, there is this coming together.
[02:02:44.128 --> 02:02:55.220]  But Kirill will always be, like we saw also at the inauguration date with President Putin, he's a religious man.
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:03:02.105]  And today we had also Netanyahu in Moscow marching with Vladimir Putin.
[02:03:02.425 --> 02:03:07.809]  In this particular moment in the Middle East, this is a very powerful message.
[02:03:08.129 --> 02:03:14.334]  Netanyahu marching in the March of Victory with Vladimir Putin, the newly elected president.
[02:03:14.414 --> 02:03:16.175]  OK, we've got to jump because I want to get to one more.
[02:03:16.295 --> 02:03:17.396]  Greg in Maryland.
[02:03:17.436 --> 02:03:18.117]  Greg, you're on the air.
[02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:18.497]  Go ahead.
[02:03:21.138 --> 02:03:22.119]  My question is this.
[02:03:24.281 --> 02:03:24.841]  I'm Catholic.
[02:03:24.901 --> 02:03:26.162]  I was raised Catholic.
[02:03:26.422 --> 02:03:27.203]  I'm 68 years old.
[02:03:28.184 --> 02:03:38.992]  Every week at the homily, the priests, no matter who it is, from what parish, whatever church, he tells us we must support this Pope, that the Pope is doing a lot of good things.
[02:03:39.693 --> 02:03:40.714]  I think differently.
[02:03:40.794 --> 02:03:42.195]  I will not follow this Pope.
[02:03:43.256 --> 02:03:44.457]  And I told a priest that.
[02:03:46.178 --> 02:03:49.441]  My question then is, is there any sign of resistance
[02:03:50.174 --> 02:04:00.444]  Within the Catholic Church, because I haven't seen any, to the things this Pope is teaching, and particularly in the United States, is there any reason?
[02:04:00.464 --> 02:04:01.265]  Greg, great question.
[02:04:01.285 --> 02:04:02.947]  I'll keep you on for an hour, but we've got to jump real fast.
[02:04:03.067 --> 02:04:03.708]  Lee, I've got one minute.
[02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:20.925]  Well, in the US, the resistance is headed by Cardinal Burke, who was kicked out of his position from the Knights of Malta and might even risk to be kicked out of the Catholic Church if he continues his crusade against Pope Francis.
[02:04:21.425 --> 02:04:24.188]  Within Rome, we have a lot of dissent.
[02:04:24.688 --> 02:04:31.153]  And a lot of episodes is the first time in history that we had the posters put all over Rome against the Pope.
[02:04:31.213 --> 02:04:36.138]  I think maybe in old times, but in modern history, we never had this happening.
[02:04:36.418 --> 02:04:38.479]  People always loved the Pope in Rome.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.101]  But now things are changing.
[02:04:44.602 --> 02:04:49.864]  There's a massive rebellion and that's why he's consolidating power.
[02:04:49.904 --> 02:04:51.344]  LeoZagami.com.
[02:04:51.665 --> 02:04:52.845]  Amazing books and info there.
[02:04:53.065 --> 02:04:55.046]  Look forward to having you back very, very soon.
[02:04:55.386 --> 02:04:56.546]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[02:04:56.566 --> 02:04:58.247]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:58.267 --> 02:04:59.627]  All right, there goes Leo Zagami.
[02:04:59.687 --> 02:05:00.227]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.247 --> 02:05:02.408]  We're going to have the President of the National Union of Body...
[02:05:05.612 --> 02:05:23.923]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:05:24.003 --> 02:05:29.427]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:05:30.307 --> 02:05:30.988]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:05:31.428 --> 02:05:34.250]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:35.871]  And so much more.
[02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:37.572]  It is concentrated.
[02:05:37.793 --> 02:05:39.514]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:05:39.534 --> 02:05:45.219]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:05:45.319 --> 02:05:46.520]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:48.482]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:05:48.562 --> 02:05:50.944]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:05:51.144 --> 02:05:52.405]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:05:52.585 --> 02:05:54.406]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:05:54.967 --> 02:05:55.567]  Immune Wall.
[02:05:55.668 --> 02:05:56.969]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:58.290]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:14.017 --> 02:06:15.137]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:15.198 --> 02:06:20.920]  We're now into the third hour.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:30.203]  InfoWars.com, PresidentPlanet.com and NewsWars.com are the main sites.
[02:06:30.463 --> 02:06:30.923]  Now,
[02:06:43.015 --> 02:06:45.016]  Beth Chapman's with us to the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:45.877 --> 02:06:54.143]  She is the president of the National Bounty Hunters Association, also one of the co-stars on Dog the Bounty Hunter Show.
[02:06:55.183 --> 02:06:59.266]  And the website's pbus.com.
[02:06:59.526 --> 02:07:03.529]  She's the president of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States, to be specific.
[02:07:04.209 --> 02:07:08.452]  And she's on with us about an incredible story that broke yesterday.
[02:07:08.612 --> 02:07:12.415]  Google has banned ads from bail bonds services.
[02:07:13.595 --> 02:07:18.618]  Saying that it's racist because some minorities get bailed out.
[02:07:20.159 --> 02:07:34.946]  And it's the same thing with this new anti-racism deal that they've had, where they let people that commit crimes, that vandalize, that physically attack, like the Parkland shooter, out over and over again and never go to jail.
[02:07:36.587 --> 02:07:40.189]  That's an anti-racism program called the Promise Program in Coward County.
[02:07:41.601 --> 02:07:43.341]  So what's behind this larger operation?
[02:07:43.421 --> 02:07:49.943]  I read a stack of news yesterday where major courts in Europe are ruling Muslims can rape girls as young as 10 because of their culture.
[02:07:49.983 --> 02:07:57.824]  There is a move to legalize crimes being committed by certain groups of people, but also keep them from getting out of jail.
[02:07:57.884 --> 02:08:05.245]  So what's really behind this and where is this leading?
[02:08:05.385 --> 02:08:07.826]  I see it as a way, as the Democrats
[02:08:09.244 --> 02:08:18.677]  Push for policies that put more people in prison, like Hillary saying black people are animals and they need to be brought to heel and giving them triple sentences for the same amount of cocaine a white person uses.
[02:08:19.827 --> 02:08:20.367]  Hi, how are you?
[02:08:47.245 --> 02:08:49.566]  I'm just trying to figure out what Google's doing.
[02:08:49.626 --> 02:08:55.527]  First they want to ban gun ads and Christian ads and take Christian holidays out of their calendars and now Apple's doing it.
[02:08:55.987 --> 02:08:58.888]  I mean, and then now they're trying to ban bail bonds ads.
[02:08:58.908 --> 02:09:00.368]  I mean, you're an expert on this.
[02:09:00.388 --> 02:09:01.929]  You're the president of one of the biggest groups.
[02:09:02.409 --> 02:09:03.669]  What are you thinking is happening?
[02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:11.211]  Well, the attack on cash bail is part of a well-coordinated attack on the judicial system.
[02:09:11.966 --> 02:09:18.855]  You know, since before the founding of this country, Bill has allowed communities to protect themselves and to secure that the defendants come back to court.
[02:09:19.536 --> 02:09:29.629]  I mean, I think that, you know, I call it the Hug Us Hug campaign, you know, because basically we've shifted all of the sympathy from the victim
[02:09:30.521 --> 02:09:31.882]  Now to the accused.
[02:09:48.238 --> 02:10:03.173]  They've gotten a lot of people to buy into this, that people are languishing in jail because they're poor, and that the wicked, evil bail bondsmen across this country are preying on minorities and on communities that are impoverished.
[02:10:03.714 --> 02:10:05.436]  And it's just simply not so.
[02:10:06.116 --> 02:10:08.637]  You know, this is a free enterprise country.
[02:10:09.258 --> 02:10:14.420]  The fact is that Google and Facebook, in my opinion, have gotten too big.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.500]  They're too big.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.121]  They have too much power.
[02:10:17.721 --> 02:10:27.806]  And, you know, for them to be able to shut down mom-and-pop operations that have basically been in this country since its founding should scare the hell out of a lot of you in this country.
[02:10:29.224 --> 02:10:29.824]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:29.964 --> 02:10:32.246]  They want only centralized government to have power.
[02:10:32.626 --> 02:10:40.750]  They hate the idea of systems where trained, armed citizens, basically under the militia system, go out and get the criminals.
[02:10:41.050 --> 02:10:45.453]  They hate the fact that it works so much better than even centralized law enforcement agencies.
[02:10:45.493 --> 02:10:51.916]  And most law enforcement agencies respect and appreciate bounty hunters and bail bondsmen and women from my study.
[02:10:51.936 --> 02:10:56.199]  But can you talk about that relationship and this real undermining of
[02:10:57.499 --> 02:10:58.780]  Of our system, and I totally agree.
[02:10:59.201 --> 02:11:03.625]  And the left and the communists, they always want destabilization.
[02:11:03.665 --> 02:11:09.890]  They always want to get rid of the death penalty, too, so their people can get out of prison once they've engaged in the political takeover.
[02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:17.917]  Antifa, all of this, and you see Bezos and all these billionaires using the communist playbook to take control of society, and I agree.
[02:11:18.177 --> 02:11:19.198]  They're all too big.
[02:11:19.418 --> 02:11:20.519]  They need to be broken up now.
[02:11:22.288 --> 02:11:34.575]  Absolutely, and I'm glad you brought up Antifa, because when you trace this stuff all the way back to its sources and its origins, and a frequent friend of yours, Lee Stranahan, basically helped me break it down.
[02:11:34.895 --> 02:11:36.336]  This goes all the way back to Antifa.
[02:11:36.676 --> 02:11:38.337]  This goes back to Angela Davis.
[02:11:39.017 --> 02:11:46.461]  This is all a larger movement where we are to believe as Americans that
[02:11:46.861 --> 02:11:51.284]  You know, we are cruel and unusual to the people that we put in jail.
[02:11:51.924 --> 02:11:58.809]  And, you know, I think that we have to be mindful of the fact that, you know, look, Chicago does not have Val Bonham.
[02:11:59.369 --> 02:12:00.850]  They have zero accountability.
[02:12:01.251 --> 02:12:05.634]  And as you can see, on a day-to-day basis, you know, their crime is through the roof.
[02:12:05.994 --> 02:12:07.715]  Their recidivism is through the roof.
[02:12:08.075 --> 02:12:13.000]  They have repeat offenders going in and out of the jail there with a revolving door.
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:17.124]  You know, we just cannot allow our country to become lawless.
[02:12:17.725 --> 02:12:32.279]  And if we do what the left wants, and just to break it down even further, what they want is a person who's accused of a crime, they want them to go into the jail, do a deep questionnaire, determine if they're a risk or not.
[02:12:32.939 --> 02:12:37.001]  They're taking the human element out of the equation.
[02:12:37.041 --> 02:12:41.323]  They don't even want to let the judges have discretion to set bail.
[02:12:41.743 --> 02:12:49.966]  They want this eight-question risk assessment from the Arnold Foundation to basically be their guide.
[02:12:50.387 --> 02:12:53.768]  You know, look, I've been in this business for almost 35 years.
[02:12:53.808 --> 02:12:55.309]  My husband's been in it, you know, 45 years.
[02:12:56.389 --> 02:13:03.391]  But it has taken a long time for us to understand criminal behavior, human nature mixed in with criminal behavior.
[02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:04.232]  What are they going to do?
[02:13:04.292 --> 02:13:06.032]  What's the drug going to tell them to do?
[02:13:06.592 --> 02:13:07.973]  You know, what's their next move?
[02:13:08.253 --> 02:13:18.176]  You have to realize, people who are addicted to opiates and heroin and things like that, those people are going to commit somewhere between four and six felonies.
[02:13:18.676 --> 02:13:20.978]  And Beth, that's so central.
[02:13:20.998 --> 02:13:21.959]  Let's expand on this.
[02:13:21.979 --> 02:13:25.242]  We ask why there's all this crime in areas of the country.
[02:13:25.322 --> 02:13:26.663]  It's in all the blue areas.
[02:13:26.703 --> 02:13:27.824]  It's all the Democrat areas.
[02:13:36.151 --> 02:13:45.519]  And from human smuggling to drug dealing to child prostitution, everywhere Democrats are in control, criminals don't get sentences at all on purpose.
[02:13:45.939 --> 02:13:47.220]  The crime rate explodes.
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:49.021]  The Democrats are in armored fortresses.
[02:13:49.422 --> 02:13:51.383]  They know what they're doing.
[02:13:51.423 --> 02:13:54.786]  And now this is an attack on the judicial system to make it far worse.
[02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:59.930]  They just want to get rid of it entirely and take our guns like Chicago, New York, D.C.
[02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:02.232]  and other areas so we can't protect ourselves further.
[02:14:02.612 --> 02:14:03.653]  Why are they doing that?
[02:14:05.546 --> 02:14:09.388]  You know, I think that it's part of the bigger funding issues.
[02:14:09.408 --> 02:14:14.332]  You know, like, for instance, I have a bill right now that's going through the House of Representatives.
[02:14:14.412 --> 02:14:15.252]  It's House Bill 2152.
[02:14:16.873 --> 02:14:22.397]  They give millions and millions and millions of dollars to these social groups.
[02:14:23.698 --> 02:14:25.118]  Like $200 million.
[02:14:25.199 --> 02:14:27.260]  It's huge money from the Bern JAG grant.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:30.162]  And they don't have to account for any of that money.
[02:14:31.403 --> 02:14:40.189]  Look, we don't even give grants to the military unless we know how many tanks they're going to buy, are they going to use a bulletproof vest, are they buying ammo.
[02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:44.212]  They have to report and they have to account for every dime and dollar that they get.
[02:14:44.573 --> 02:14:51.898]  But these liberal social justice groups that our government is giving the Burn Shack Grant monies to, they don't have to account for it at all.
[02:14:51.938 --> 02:14:55.761]  And they're giving millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars.
[02:14:56.301 --> 02:15:07.304]  And I think that this was just a bigger, you know, I don't want to use the word conspiracy, but, you know, it was just a bigger plan to basically, you know, put the government in control of everything.
[02:15:07.364 --> 02:15:07.904]  Absolutely.
[02:15:07.944 --> 02:15:12.226]  Beth Chapman, obviously, is very famous for her TV shows.
[02:15:12.266 --> 02:15:15.286]  She was the youngest licensed bail bondsman person ever in Colorado.
[02:15:15.947 --> 02:15:18.167]  She also, of course, is married to Dog the Bounty Hunter.
[02:15:18.547 --> 02:15:20.048]  Pbus.com.
[02:15:20.108 --> 02:15:23.769]  She is the president of the Professional Bail Agency of the United States organization.
[02:15:24.409 --> 02:15:33.715]  This is a war on law and order, and this is all part of the globalist move to consolidate federally under the U.N., the Strong Cities Initiative.
[02:15:34.055 --> 02:15:35.456]  It's all been announced.
[02:15:35.476 --> 02:15:40.860]  They're attacking sheriff's departments, trying to get rid of sheriff's departments, have them consolidate under cities, which is backwards.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:43.622]  It goes from the states to the counties, then to the cities.
[02:15:44.222 --> 02:15:54.009]  They are basically obliterating our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our American system, and they're targeting right now the bounty hunters and bail bonds folks in this country.
[02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:55.830]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:58.211]  Ladies and gentlemen, NewsWars.com.
[02:15:58.491 --> 02:15:59.492]  Please spread that link.
[02:15:59.612 --> 02:16:00.852]  NewsWars.com.
[02:16:02.853 --> 02:16:17.101]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:25.726]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[02:16:27.147 --> 02:16:29.670]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[02:16:30.471 --> 02:16:33.874]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[02:16:34.835 --> 02:16:36.997]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[02:16:38.699 --> 02:16:43.844]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[02:16:45.805 --> 02:16:52.408]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:54.389]  It's up to us personally.
[02:16:55.790 --> 02:17:02.634]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:04.435]  I expected that to happen.
[02:17:05.615 --> 02:17:06.956]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:17:08.942 --> 02:17:19.868]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[02:17:20.569 --> 02:17:22.110]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:34.437]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[02:17:35.017 --> 02:17:37.199]  And we've already come so far together
[02:17:38.223 --> 02:17:47.249]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[02:17:47.809 --> 02:17:53.232]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[02:17:54.373 --> 02:18:02.258]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[02:18:04.471 --> 02:18:09.216]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[02:18:10.737 --> 02:18:12.739]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[02:18:13.119 --> 02:18:14.721]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[02:18:15.722 --> 02:18:18.364]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[02:18:19.165 --> 02:18:20.987]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[02:18:21.027 --> 02:18:25.931]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[02:18:27.012 --> 02:18:37.807]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[02:18:37.847 --> 02:18:41.812]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[02:18:43.234 --> 02:18:43.874]  Our game changing.
[02:18:44.294 --> 02:18:45.795]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[02:18:45.995 --> 02:18:47.156]  The other equation of probiotic.
[02:18:47.196 --> 02:18:50.757]  It's now stronger and a lower price in fullwarestore.com.
[02:18:51.077 --> 02:18:56.620]  We've got the real red pill that's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:01.522]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids, just does incredible things.
[02:19:01.962 --> 02:19:03.422]  Look into the real red pill for yourself.
[02:19:03.442 --> 02:19:06.404]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[02:19:06.424 --> 02:19:08.965]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:19:09.505 --> 02:19:14.310]  That's 4 to 5 of Choletal Silver and Iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[02:19:14.931 --> 02:19:29.407]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of Choletal Silver out there, Silver Sol Nano Silver Iodine
[02:19:29.807 --> 02:19:33.410]  The ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[02:19:33.450 --> 02:19:34.751]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[02:19:34.952 --> 02:19:36.133]  You can swallow it as well.
[02:19:36.533 --> 02:19:42.818]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:43.139 --> 02:19:44.500]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:54.148]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:19:54.448 --> 02:19:57.511]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:20:06.293 --> 02:20:08.904]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.259 --> 02:20:26.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:26.821 --> 02:20:28.202]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.663 --> 02:20:42.693]  Coming up in the next segment, Christy Mazurek, one of the ladies that got reportedly abused by the New York AG, the disgraced Me Too guy, is going to be joining us.
[02:20:42.914 --> 02:20:46.897]  She joined Roger Stone during the war room yesterday with Ellen Schreuer.
[02:20:46.937 --> 02:20:48.518]  I thought it was pretty powerful.
[02:20:49.198 --> 02:20:50.279]  What is it about these guys?
[02:20:50.299 --> 02:20:50.840]  But here's the deal.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.201]  Roughing up girls you're dating?
[02:20:54.087 --> 02:20:54.948]  It's a bad thing to do.
[02:20:56.729 --> 02:20:57.989]  And if it's true, she's getting in a lot of trouble.
[02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:59.991]  Calling them brown slaves and all this.
[02:21:01.091 --> 02:21:03.153]  Well, that's not illegal, but it's scummy.
[02:21:04.794 --> 02:21:15.080]  But what about covering up for Weinstein with... Now they're saying seven women that went to the police and said that he raped them.
[02:21:15.221 --> 02:21:20.904]  Well, we already have his driver of many years, his assistant of many years, two different witnesses, saying he raped women all the time.
[02:21:21.304 --> 02:21:22.665]  He liked women that weighed like 95 pounds.
[02:21:22.685 --> 02:21:23.466]  He'd get on top of them.
[02:21:25.129 --> 02:21:27.871]  I'm digressing, I'm going to ask Beth Chapman about that as well.
[02:21:28.452 --> 02:21:35.578]  Again, she's married a dog to Bounty Hunter, super famous in her own right, the youngest Bales-Bondsman person ever in Colorado history and so much more.
[02:21:35.598 --> 02:21:36.899]  Everybody knows who she is.
[02:21:36.919 --> 02:21:43.864]  She's been a gymnast, ice skater, nightclub singer, waitress, clerk in her early life besides being a Bounty Hunter and a Bales-Bondsman.
[02:21:44.325 --> 02:21:46.827]  And Google's saying we want it basically gotten rid of.
[02:21:47.992 --> 02:21:49.313]  You can't advertise with us.
[02:21:49.353 --> 02:21:59.437]  And that's what Matt Drudge called it and coined it, you know, ten years ago was these online gulags, these online ghettos where they want to kick us all off the main web and then they're coming for that later.
[02:22:00.217 --> 02:22:01.377]  They're coming for our websites later.
[02:22:01.397 --> 02:22:02.098]  They're coming after me.
[02:22:03.178 --> 02:22:07.520]  So, Beth Chapman, looking at this, I think you absolutely nailed it.
[02:22:08.516 --> 02:22:15.597]  They're trying to make criminal activity legal, and so many Democratic leaders, it turns out, are involved in all these crimes.
[02:22:16.237 --> 02:22:20.258]  And they were protecting the shooter at Parkland for years when he said he was going to come kill everybody.
[02:22:20.638 --> 02:22:22.999]  The policeman called 22 times, the FBI three times.
[02:22:23.439 --> 02:22:24.619]  It's the same every time.
[02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:26.439]  Why do they protect criminals?
[02:22:27.199 --> 02:22:29.220]  For me, they are a criminal group.
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:34.561]  They are a criminal group at the top, and below that, a bunch of lazy people that want handouts.
[02:22:34.581 --> 02:22:35.081]  What do you think?
[02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:37.750]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:22:37.811 --> 02:22:39.191]  I think a lot of them are criminals.
[02:22:39.231 --> 02:22:44.073]  Look, let's just talk about Bob Hertzberg, Senator Bob Hertzberg in California.
[02:22:44.493 --> 02:22:48.035]  He is the guy who is pushing Senate Bill 10, which is the No Money Bail Act.
[02:22:48.435 --> 02:23:01.500]  You know, even though the California District Attorney's Association is against it, the California Alliance of Judges have come out against it, the Sheriff's Department has come out against it, the Klaus Kids Foundation, you know Mark Klaus,
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:02.660]  I don't know.
[02:23:21.911 --> 02:23:23.672]  You know, squeaking through the cracks over there.
[02:23:23.732 --> 02:23:26.693]  But, you know, their credibility is at question.
[02:23:26.733 --> 02:23:34.536]  A lot of these guys, look at Anthony Weiner, you know, these guys were all people who had criminal behavior going on in their own homes, in their own background.
[02:23:34.936 --> 02:23:37.778]  This AG from New York is absolutely outrageous.
[02:23:37.818 --> 02:23:43.480]  Right now, Governor Cuomo is taking the bite out of crime, literally.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.061]  Because he has tied the hands of law enforcement.
[02:23:47.421 --> 02:23:51.642]  They know that on a minor crime or misdemeanor, no one's going to jail.
[02:23:52.203 --> 02:23:53.523]  They don't let them put them in jail.
[02:23:53.543 --> 02:23:56.024]  They'll only let them get a ticket.
[02:23:56.464 --> 02:24:08.748]  Even currently, right now, if you go and you steal from a big box retailer, Walmart, Kmart, Target, whatever, you have to steal over $1,000 worth of merchandise before they can even call the police on you.
[02:24:08.968 --> 02:24:15.358]  And for folks that don't know, that drives up the prices for everybody else, and it makes for where everything's locked up and you can't look at it.
[02:24:15.739 --> 02:24:18.263]  And I mean, I'm in stores all the time and see people stealing.
[02:24:18.323 --> 02:24:19.224]  It's epidemic!
[02:24:20.748 --> 02:24:20.928]  Yeah.
[02:24:50.708 --> 02:24:51.228]  We're good to go.
[02:25:15.846 --> 02:25:19.368]  You know, but what about the guy that works hard every day who went out and bought that car?
[02:25:19.769 --> 02:25:31.916]  He should just be disregarded because this, you know, poor thug... Well, when I was growing up in Dallas, and I only lived there one year when I was 16, I had my car stolen twice, and the cops would laugh and wouldn't even come out.
[02:25:31.937 --> 02:25:39.822]  And then when I got my car with the engine and the wheels all off of it, insurance wouldn't even cover it all, and I ended up having to get a worse vehicle each time.
[02:25:39.842 --> 02:25:44.885]  And then now, I've been in Austin, and now we're getting all the crime is starting up.
[02:25:45.245 --> 02:25:47.126]  And to the left, it's all funny.
[02:25:47.166 --> 02:25:48.366]  It's all hilarious to them.
[02:25:48.386 --> 02:25:50.687]  And I think it's really part of a mental illness.
[02:25:50.747 --> 02:26:00.631]  I'm sure you've seen the Project Veritas videos of Democrats behind the scenes all over the country admitting to committing incredible crimes and covering up children being raped in schools.
[02:26:00.711 --> 02:26:03.312]  I mean, it's just crazy how corrupt they are.
[02:26:03.352 --> 02:26:05.994]  And then the whole criminal-in-chief, Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:07.694 --> 02:26:11.796]  Well, then you've got Senator Whitmire, I think is his name, there in Texas.
[02:26:12.501 --> 02:26:26.467]  You know, they're just now starting this hug-a-thug campaign there in Texas, and so you're going to start to see a lot more of this, unfortunately, because it is sweeping out of Harris County, and it's going over to Austin and Galveston and to Dallas.
[02:26:26.927 --> 02:26:31.750]  And you know, these social groups are basically coming through and they're suing, you know.
[02:26:31.810 --> 02:26:35.671]  Oh, you left Otis the town drunk in jail for too long.
[02:26:36.011 --> 02:26:37.292]  Look, we have an obligation.
[02:26:37.312 --> 02:26:41.514]  If you pick up someone who is drunk, they are
[02:26:44.077 --> 02:26:51.567]  You supposedly just let them go kill somebody.
[02:26:51.967 --> 02:26:53.069]  Let them kill somebody else.
[02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:54.551]  Where is this all going?
[02:26:54.611 --> 02:26:59.197]  Can't people see Democrats and leftist countries always wreck everything?
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:01.640]  Yeah, they do.
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:08.602]  But listen, that's a good point, but do you remember in the show Andy Griffith, Otis would come in and put himself in jail?
[02:27:09.022 --> 02:27:11.922]  And then in the morning when he was sober, he'd release himself.
[02:27:12.303 --> 02:27:16.984]  The fact is that when police put people in jail, we have to let them come down.
[02:27:17.004 --> 02:27:18.364]  We have to let them sober up.
[02:27:18.704 --> 02:27:24.885]  You cannot just release them back into the community in the way that you got them, or that's recklessly endangering your whole community.
[02:27:25.245 --> 02:27:27.466]  Like, we have just gone off the rails.
[02:27:28.203 --> 02:27:37.816]  You're really making me think, you know, that's why for decades the illegal aliens get let go for drunk driving, then for more serious crimes in San Francisco lets the guy go, admits he shot the young woman in the back and killed her.
[02:27:38.257 --> 02:27:44.185]  I mean, it started with the illegal aliens, and now it's just gonna be all these people are able to commit any crimes they want.
[02:27:45.814 --> 02:27:46.014]  Yep.
[02:27:46.735 --> 02:27:51.921]  And in the state of California, you know, they're going through going, well, we're suffering because we have so many people in jail.
[02:27:52.221 --> 02:27:56.966]  Well, they're suffering the bad effects of their three strikes and their outlaw that came, you know, many, many years ago.
[02:27:57.447 --> 02:28:01.912]  But moreover, they sentenced people for far too much crime or for far too much time.
[02:28:02.572 --> 02:28:04.593]  You know, their time doesn't fit the crime.
[02:28:04.994 --> 02:28:08.496]  There's a lot of things that could be done to alleviate jail overcrowding.
[02:28:08.836 --> 02:28:09.977]  Oh, I agree, I agree.
[02:28:09.997 --> 02:28:14.580]  They'll put non-violent marijuana people in for a couple years and then let an aggravated felon out.
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:16.341]  And the Democrats do it on purpose.
[02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:18.102]  They do it on purpose, Beth!
[02:28:19.588 --> 02:28:20.028]  That's right.
[02:28:20.148 --> 02:28:23.170]  And you know, my husband is famous for catching a guy named Andrew Luster.
[02:28:23.530 --> 02:28:25.631]  He was the Max Factor cosmetics heir.
[02:28:26.212 --> 02:28:28.653]  He had 185 counts of rape and poisoning.
[02:28:29.033 --> 02:28:32.175]  Right now in the state of California, he is eligible to be released.
[02:28:33.027 --> 02:28:37.971]  Under the Prop 47 realignment, reinvestment crap.
[02:28:37.991 --> 02:28:41.494]  This guy has 86 counts of rape and poisoning.
[02:28:41.934 --> 02:28:45.217]  And he could be freed at any time under Jerry Brown's new regime.
[02:28:45.977 --> 02:28:50.121]  And they let Cruz kill all those people in Florida.
[02:28:50.141 --> 02:28:50.621]  Amazing.
[02:28:51.342 --> 02:28:53.263]  Beth Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:28:53.303 --> 02:28:56.426]  Please join us again in the near future in studio or via Skype.
[02:28:56.466 --> 02:28:56.986]  God bless you.
[02:28:58.287 --> 02:28:58.948]  Thank you, Scott.
[02:28:58.988 --> 02:28:59.308]  Bye-bye.
[02:29:03.155 --> 02:29:03.755]  Alpha Power.
[02:29:04.116 --> 02:29:04.916]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:29:05.156 --> 02:29:11.119]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.342]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:29:16.222 --> 02:29:24.167]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:29:24.707 --> 02:29:28.089]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:29:29.029 --> 02:29:31.750]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:29:32.311 --> 02:29:34.011]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:29:34.371 --> 02:29:39.454]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and I say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:29:39.754 --> 02:29:44.716]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product.
[02:29:47.797 --> 02:29:48.077]  In them.
[02:29:48.478 --> 02:29:49.518]  Nobody else does that.
[02:29:49.578 --> 02:29:52.360]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:29:52.661 --> 02:29:54.662]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:29:55.062 --> 02:30:00.406]  The second shipment is now in at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:30:03.772 --> 02:30:04.513]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:04.573 --> 02:30:14.139]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:14.739 --> 02:30:19.903]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:20.243 --> 02:30:23.025]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:23.245 --> 02:30:31.991]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:34.112 --> 02:30:53.200]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:53.701 --> 02:30:55.001]  It is amazing!
[02:30:56.382 --> 02:31:01.364]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:05.121]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:05.161 --> 02:31:05.501]  Go ahead.
[02:31:06.402 --> 02:31:08.303]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:08.343 --> 02:31:18.669]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:31:18.849 --> 02:31:22.191]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:31:22.731 --> 02:31:25.094]  For the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:31:25.294 --> 02:31:27.636]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:31:27.696 --> 02:31:27.957]  Thank you.
[02:31:28.617 --> 02:31:33.542]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[02:31:33.562 --> 02:31:34.864]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[02:31:35.424 --> 02:31:38.407]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:31:38.447 --> 02:31:39.428]  They are quality.
[02:31:39.769 --> 02:31:41.030]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:44.233]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:31:44.393 --> 02:31:44.954]  Absolutely.
[02:31:45.434 --> 02:31:58.346]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:03.189 --> 02:32:06.771]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:32:07.052 --> 02:32:13.736]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[02:32:14.036 --> 02:32:18.179]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:23.933]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[02:32:24.334 --> 02:32:25.334]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[02:32:25.354 --> 02:32:30.438]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com.
[02:32:30.778 --> 02:32:36.562]  Local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.

[02:32:52.690 --> 02:32:58.192]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[02:32:58.592 --> 02:33:00.793]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:01.153 --> 02:33:02.374]  Please shop with the good guys.
[02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:10.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.548 --> 02:33:19.651]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.619 --> 02:33:28.981]  All right, we're getting her lined up on the phone line right now.
[02:33:29.041 --> 02:33:34.464]  Christy Mazurek, one of the reported victims of Schneiderman, the creepy George Soros man.
[02:33:35.224 --> 02:33:38.026]  They're helping protect everybody in Harvey Weinstein in New York.
[02:33:39.427 --> 02:33:40.868]  Well, we're getting her on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:40.888 --> 02:33:43.750]  We're running two, really three giant sales right now.
[02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:45.271]  They're gonna have to end early next week.
[02:33:46.291 --> 02:33:50.294]  Superbloom is our super popular
[02:33:51.550 --> 02:34:00.376]  Fluoride-free, high-quality, fortified with colloidal silver and iodine and tea tree oil and peppermint oil and so much more concentrated to it that people love it.
[02:34:01.938 --> 02:34:05.260]  But only a few percentage of the listeners buy products from us.
[02:34:07.141 --> 02:34:09.643]  But we've noticed this is our best-selling product.
[02:34:09.683 --> 02:34:11.745]  It's not our main profit center because it's so inexpensive.
[02:34:13.592 --> 02:34:17.035]  But we've noticed that when we offer it at 40-50% off, we get a lot of new customers.
[02:34:17.075 --> 02:34:30.084]  So, even though it's going to sell out the next few weeks, long before I get more towards the end of June, I am selling Super Blue toothpaste, built by my dad, the dentist and oral surgeon, but made by the biggest organic producer of toothpaste in the country.
[02:34:31.165 --> 02:34:32.586]  We have them produce it for us.
[02:34:33.927 --> 02:34:41.653]  For 50% off, that means the mouthwash, the children's toothpaste, the adult toothpaste, the immune gargle, all of it, and our ultimate turmeric formula, 50% off, bodies.
[02:34:44.318 --> 02:34:46.560]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:50.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, body's whole body support.
[02:34:51.764 --> 02:34:53.005]  At info or store dot com.
[02:34:53.405 --> 02:34:55.987]  The autoimmune boosting the inflammation.
[02:34:56.688 --> 02:34:58.389]  Lowering all of its legendary.
[02:35:01.852 --> 02:35:03.433]  95% for human and level. 95%
[02:35:09.465 --> 02:35:11.747]  Curcumin and Lebel, nobody else that we know of has that.
[02:35:11.787 --> 02:35:13.148]  The average leading competitor has a 3%.
[02:35:13.408 --> 02:35:17.131]  But if you've taken real turmeric, folks, you will experience it well.
[02:35:17.572 --> 02:35:19.733]  We set out to bring you the very strongest out there.
[02:35:20.134 --> 02:35:27.680]  To be honest, out of thousands of brands that's so popular, there's two or three others I've gone out and looked at that claim they've got something as strong.
[02:35:29.017 --> 02:35:35.379]  One of them claimed stronger, and I had the company expert look at it, and they said it's impossible for there to be that much in here, period.
[02:35:35.959 --> 02:35:39.261]  But it's amongst the best, and it's discounted massively at a regular price.
[02:35:39.781 --> 02:35:43.042]  But at $26 or $29, you can't beat it.
[02:35:43.222 --> 02:35:43.542]  Okay.
[02:35:44.942 --> 02:35:54.706]  Now, Kristi Mazurek is a political activist and president of Successful Strategies, Inc., a public relations and business development firm.
[02:35:55.649 --> 02:35:59.270]  And of course you've seen her on television talk shows across the country, nationally.
[02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:17.455]  And I'm not going to get into her whole long bio, but she is a respected lady amongst the four women coming out saying that the former New York Attorney General, who's now resigned, was super aggressive, super crazy, and abusive.
[02:36:17.855 --> 02:36:20.456]  And other women have said that he called them brown slaves.
[02:36:21.983 --> 02:36:26.027]  All I know is he protected Weinstein in that investigation.
[02:36:26.067 --> 02:36:26.667]  That's confirmed.
[02:36:27.128 --> 02:36:32.033]  With all these women coming forward saying Weinstein raped them, and we've got the driver that worked for him 20 years.
[02:36:32.073 --> 02:36:37.197]  We've got his valet, his assistant, saying he raped women.
[02:36:37.317 --> 02:36:41.541]  So that right there puts a big black cloud over Schneiderman.
[02:36:42.363 --> 02:36:44.265]  But you look at the photos and videos of him.
[02:36:44.305 --> 02:36:47.007]  I mean, he looks like a crazed loon to me.
[02:36:47.027 --> 02:36:49.450]  I mean, he's got that American psycho look.
[02:36:49.470 --> 02:36:51.231]  So I believe Christine Masaryk.
[02:36:51.752 --> 02:36:54.514]  And the weird thing is the Democrats have kicked off this whole Me Too thing.
[02:36:54.534 --> 02:37:00.360]  Because I guess they know it hurt Hillary that, you know, she had connections to Bill and all that.
[02:37:01.693 --> 02:37:02.433]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:37:31.351 --> 02:37:39.537]  I came to meet Eric Shniderman when he was a state senator in 2008 when I was working for a man, Assemblyman Dennis Gaberzak.
[02:37:40.818 --> 02:37:48.023]  I and six other employees of the former disgraced Assemblyman are suing him and the state of New York
[02:37:48.638 --> 02:38:03.084]  And Eric Schneiderman, for the past eight years, has tried to cover up all the salacious text messages, inappropriate videos, aggressive sexual attacks and assaults on my former female colleagues.
[02:38:03.984 --> 02:38:08.426]  Kind of as a way to cover up for his pal, Dennis Gaberzak.
[02:38:09.918 --> 02:38:10.258]  Wow.
[02:38:10.619 --> 02:38:17.403]  So, Christy, Masaryk is our guest, and already now, you're saying it's expanding past the four women.
[02:38:17.423 --> 02:38:25.749]  You're saying already that he's been involved covering up, just like we know he's done with the infamous Harvey Weinstein.
[02:38:26.970 --> 02:38:36.196]  Well, Alex, I can speak to, just in my first-hand experience, serving in the Assembly in 2008 as a Communications Director.
[02:38:36.981 --> 02:38:58.732]  Since that time, there have been dozens of women who have come forward with complaints, and through either Shelley Silver, the former Assembly Speaker, along with the Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, they covered up, paid off, settled out of court, or bullied these women to back down.
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:02.982]  Many of them lost their jobs, including myself, Alex.
[02:39:03.382 --> 02:39:14.409]  When I went to the Speaker's office, my pay was cut in half by Assemblyman Gaberzak, and I waited patiently because I knew a leopard doesn't change their spots.
[02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:19.852]  It took a few years, and several women reached out to me and said, will you help?
[02:39:20.392 --> 02:39:21.533]  We gathered together.
[02:39:21.853 --> 02:39:25.095]  We launched our formal complaint in December of 2013.
[02:39:26.846 --> 02:39:38.095]  An ethics commission found Assemblyman Gaberzak guilty of violations of a public officer and fined him $100,000 in December of 2015.
[02:39:38.956 --> 02:39:41.038]  Guess why I haven't had my day in court, Alex?
[02:39:41.718 --> 02:39:43.720]  Two words, Eric Schniderman.
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:48.144]  And it's the same words time and time and time again, and now everybody knows why.
[02:39:49.076 --> 02:39:58.204]  You know, if we do a live report about something silly like meteorites or volcanoes or something, Google doesn't block it, YouTube doesn't block it, it gets a million views.
[02:39:58.705 --> 02:40:01.207]  But something like this, they demonetize it, they block it.
[02:40:01.227 --> 02:40:04.450]  We can see them shadow ban when you were on with Roger Stone last night.
[02:40:04.930 --> 02:40:07.253]  They just banned that video where it's on the site.
[02:40:08.113 --> 02:40:10.634]  On YouTube, but no one can basically share it.
[02:40:11.114 --> 02:40:35.744]  It didn't go out to the subscribers, so I'm just adding to the ongoing cover-up that I was told by folks that were saying I should get you on because you're so credible, that it's much, much bigger like an iceberg beneath the surface of the cover-ups and the behavior, and really a club of men who engage in this type of abusive behavior, and that he's been promoted to this high position to then cover it up on a statewide basis.
[02:40:37.434 --> 02:40:39.884]  As I said, he was a state senator at the time.
[02:40:41.815 --> 02:40:52.202]  My service, there were at least two other assemblymen who had complaints from more than one female employee lingering.
[02:40:52.602 --> 02:40:57.946]  Fidel Lopez is one, Micah Kellner is another, and of course Mr. Gabrzak.
[02:40:58.406 --> 02:41:09.634]  Eric has gone so far using the Attorney General's office to stifle us and to make us miss critical timelines so we are forced into appeals.
[02:41:10.279 --> 02:41:14.000]  I have always said to my attorney, I will fight this to the Supreme Court.
[02:41:14.420 --> 02:41:17.081]  I don't live if I'm living in a cardboard box.
[02:41:17.581 --> 02:41:27.623]  Because in the time since I filed this notice of claim, Mr. Schneiderman has come back with his Attorney General's office and levied charges against me for election law violations.
[02:41:28.163 --> 02:41:37.786]  I am the daughter of a former Erie County legislator, Director of Veterans Affairs, and my family has been in public service for seven decades.
[02:41:38.366 --> 02:41:51.186]  I think I know how to run a campaign cleanly, and I don't find it too coincidental that when I went after Assemblyman Gaberzak, Eric Schneiderman and the Democrats here in Erie County came after me.
[02:41:52.116 --> 02:41:55.758]  Wow, so they're not letting us promote your interview with Stone.
[02:41:56.238 --> 02:42:02.320]  I'm sure they'll try to block this, but it's going out on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds of TV stations and more than now 80 cable stations.
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:17.566]  We're growing, but people really should get mad because it's not just the sexual harassment or reportedly slapping women around that did have consensual sex and then calling them slaves, but it's the cover-up and the repercussions and the persecution and just the gangsterish behavior.
[02:42:18.827 --> 02:42:19.347]  They're bullies.
[02:42:19.747 --> 02:42:20.848]  They're absolutely bullies.
[02:42:21.898 --> 02:42:34.553]  And they know that, especially, I appreciate the Me Too movement, but as I said to Roger yesterday, coming after people almost a decade ago, it was the Me First movement.
[02:42:35.496 --> 02:42:39.338]  And they tried to stifle, tried to stifle, and it kind of imploded.
[02:42:39.758 --> 02:42:45.881]  But the former assemblyman and other colleagues have a friend in Eric Schneiderman, who's a little devil.
[02:42:46.221 --> 02:42:46.622]  That's right.
[02:42:46.662 --> 02:42:48.162]  Christy Mazurek, stay with us.
[02:42:48.202 --> 02:42:54.205]  I want to come back and talk about the next shoe to drop, what you think is coming next, and how do you ever become the star of the MeToo movement?
[02:42:54.506 --> 02:42:56.186]  I mean, that's what makes it even sicker.
[02:42:56.627 --> 02:42:59.128]  We'll be right back, breaking down the crazed maniac.
[02:43:02.455 --> 02:43:06.019]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:43:06.299 --> 02:43:12.986]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[02:43:13.286 --> 02:43:17.430]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.
[02:43:18.479 --> 02:43:23.182]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[02:43:23.582 --> 02:43:24.582]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[02:43:24.602 --> 02:43:35.789]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, Ford slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[02:43:35.829 --> 02:43:37.990]  And when you financially go to Infowarsstore.com,
[02:43:38.570 --> 02:43:44.314]  When you take advantage of the huge sales and the great products for everything in your life, it's about making your life better.
[02:43:44.954 --> 02:43:47.116]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds, springtime's here.
[02:43:47.676 --> 02:43:51.619]  The highest quality books, films, Patriot apparel to spread the word.
[02:43:51.959 --> 02:43:57.443]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[02:43:57.863 --> 02:44:00.045]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:00.405 --> 02:44:01.626]  Please shop with the good guys.
[02:44:06.394 --> 02:44:18.238]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[02:44:18.898 --> 02:44:28.221]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[02:44:28.421 --> 02:44:33.243]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[02:44:33.763 --> 02:44:43.047]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[02:44:43.888 --> 02:44:48.630]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:50.170]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[02:44:50.771 --> 02:44:57.074]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[02:44:57.114 --> 02:44:57.894]  Here's my problem.
[02:44:58.414 --> 02:45:06.861]  When I do take the bodies and the extuate things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear, I tend to get mad.
[02:45:07.241 --> 02:45:08.402]  I know, I'm the same issue.
[02:45:08.682 --> 02:45:08.842]  Yeah.
[02:45:09.463 --> 02:45:12.285]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[02:45:12.385 --> 02:45:14.047]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[02:45:15.047 --> 02:45:20.053]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[02:45:20.373 --> 02:45:25.638]  This is an incredible time to be alive, and I'm glad you mentioned that, because bodies have just come back in.
[02:45:25.818 --> 02:45:29.362]  It's 25% off, and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[02:45:29.642 --> 02:45:31.064]  We went out with the top labs.
[02:45:31.244 --> 02:45:33.586]  We want the strongest concentrate.
[02:45:34.347 --> 02:45:38.628]  Of it out there, and Mike, you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products.
[02:45:38.948 --> 02:45:43.829]  You were saying that you really like bodies and you think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric.
[02:45:44.549 --> 02:45:45.350]  It's just incredible.
[02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:54.472]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[02:45:55.012 --> 02:45:55.492]  This is key.
[02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:59.473]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem, and you have inflammation of the brain.
[02:45:59.533 --> 02:46:01.053]  They call that something down the road.
[02:46:01.093 --> 02:46:03.534]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[02:46:03.954 --> 02:46:05.555]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[02:46:05.595 --> 02:46:07.115]  They call that something else down the road.
[02:46:07.135 --> 02:46:12.537]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say it's inflammation in the brain.
[02:46:12.917 --> 02:46:15.578]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[02:46:15.719 --> 02:46:16.399]  That's exactly right.
[02:46:16.759 --> 02:46:22.381]  Now, your product is an extract and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[02:46:22.621 --> 02:46:27.063]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICP-MS mass spec testing.
[02:46:27.683 --> 02:46:30.884]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[02:46:31.224 --> 02:46:36.646]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:38.347]  Well, that's another reason.
[02:46:38.407 --> 02:46:45.389]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals test if you don't.
[02:46:45.529 --> 02:46:45.949]  Exactly.
[02:46:46.090 --> 02:46:53.016]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[02:46:53.277 --> 02:46:57.821]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[02:47:05.729 --> 02:47:08.352]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:21.802]  Christy Mazurek.
[02:47:22.382 --> 02:47:23.603]  Mainstream media.
[02:47:25.165 --> 02:47:26.286]  Government cover-ups.
[02:47:27.767 --> 02:47:28.688]  You want answers?
[02:47:29.669 --> 02:47:30.650]  Well, so does he.
[02:47:31.591 --> 02:47:37.897]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:39.859 --> 02:47:43.202]  Christy Mazurek, like Zurich, Switzerland, is our guest.
[02:47:44.462 --> 02:47:50.285]  I love how I butchered her name a little bit so it sounded like the guy from the state senate she'd been fighting with.
[02:47:50.305 --> 02:47:53.366]  And I was like, that name sounds very similar.
[02:47:53.386 --> 02:47:55.787]  And then one of the producers is like, it's Zurich.
[02:47:56.187 --> 02:47:56.988]  Ma Zurich.
[02:47:57.068 --> 02:47:58.628]  Like Zurich, Switzerland.
[02:47:58.788 --> 02:48:00.269]  Did I finally get it right, Christy?
[02:48:01.149 --> 02:48:02.350]  Hey, that's okay.
[02:48:02.370 --> 02:48:06.892]  You know, it's a Polish last name, so I have to cut some people some slack.
[02:48:07.272 --> 02:48:10.073]  But I do know Eric Schneiderman knows how to say my name.
[02:48:10.374 --> 02:48:13.195]  Because he certainly has said it a lot in the last five years.
[02:48:13.928 --> 02:48:14.228]  I bet.
[02:48:14.248 --> 02:48:16.730]  So again, you know the inside baseball.
[02:48:16.770 --> 02:48:18.231]  Somebody from the start exposing this.
[02:48:18.731 --> 02:48:26.235]  When the House of Cards comes down, which is now happening, it's way more than just these four women saying that he got really vicious with them, called them names.
[02:48:27.096 --> 02:48:29.197]  Did you ever hear anything like this from other people?
[02:48:29.377 --> 02:48:30.958]  Because the guy looks like a crazy maniac.
[02:48:30.998 --> 02:48:35.521]  I mean, I'm not into guys, but if I was a girl, he looks really creepy.
[02:48:37.362 --> 02:48:38.983]  Well, let's just say this.
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:48.167]  I find it really disingenuous and insincere when people are saying they're so shocked to hear that this has happened.
[02:48:48.187 --> 02:49:01.478]  I was rolling in the streets of Albany for several years, and Mr. Shnarderman was never at a loss for trying to track down a new date, so to speak.
[02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:04.611]  Well, I know folks that know him.
[02:49:04.631 --> 02:49:05.931]  I was talking to some lawyers that know him.
[02:49:05.951 --> 02:49:07.592]  They say he is a maniac.
[02:49:07.872 --> 02:49:08.593]  Just period.
[02:49:08.733 --> 02:49:12.015]  He's bouncing off the walls.
[02:49:13.155 --> 02:49:19.579]  You know, as I mentioned to you, I'm facing election law violations and I want to be very candid about that.
[02:49:20.099 --> 02:49:27.103]  I am facing two felonies for taking photographs with two different candidates, with my father
[02:49:27.659 --> 02:49:37.323]  Who is a silver and bronze star decorated Vietnam veteran who, as I mentioned, was a county legislator and a director of Veterans Affairs.
[02:49:37.763 --> 02:49:39.064]  And it was for a campaign.
[02:49:39.644 --> 02:49:43.286]  The candidates didn't know what those pictures are going to be used for.
[02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:45.327]  So that's the comedy of it.
[02:49:45.767 --> 02:49:47.247]  Yeah, but hold on, hold on.
[02:49:47.287 --> 02:49:49.068]  I mean, what weird esoteric law is this?
[02:49:49.088 --> 02:49:50.469]  Because they're recriminating against you now.
[02:49:50.489 --> 02:49:51.989]  I guess they've been recriminating against other women.
[02:49:52.009 --> 02:49:55.371]  But how is it a crime to take a photo with your father and then use it in a campaign ad?
[02:49:56.645 --> 02:49:59.867]  Uh, well, they're claiming I co-ordinated.
[02:50:00.267 --> 02:50:03.569]  Well, I actually have spoken to the attorneys.
[02:50:03.709 --> 02:50:06.071]  Yeah, but aren't you allowed to take photos for your campaign?
[02:50:07.132 --> 02:50:08.693]  You know, it's crazy, isn't it?
[02:50:08.953 --> 02:50:09.733]  At my own home.
[02:50:10.274 --> 02:50:14.936]  I can't have my father come to my residence and take a photograph of the candidate.
[02:50:15.957 --> 02:50:20.540]  So, so that's the type of things he charges women with that speak up is just weird.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:23.582]  Just like he's been suing Trump, what is it, 50-something times?
[02:50:24.241 --> 02:50:24.762]  For sure.
[02:50:25.042 --> 02:50:25.543]  For sure.
[02:50:25.563 --> 02:50:36.916]  And again, how he has done it, and it's not just, I think I'm one of the few females that he's come after in the political realm, but as you know, there have been numerous
[02:50:37.826 --> 02:50:53.569]  Politicians, former politicians that have come under his umbrella of election law violation, and they wind up getting fines, but it's after several years of intimidation by state police investigators, the FBI, the Inspector General's office, the U.S.
[02:50:53.629 --> 02:51:02.551]  Attorney's office, hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that I and my colleagues have had to pay out, to no end.
[02:51:03.131 --> 02:51:04.931]  And just to have this schmuck
[02:51:05.595 --> 02:51:10.017]  Run amok of people's lives knowing what I knew about him.
[02:51:10.177 --> 02:51:10.938]  Let me bring this up.
[02:51:11.238 --> 02:51:24.385]  Have you seen Samantha Bee, her interview with him last year, worshipping him as the white python, weird sexual references, saying she's got a crush on him, he's the ultimate man for standing up for women.
[02:51:24.825 --> 02:51:29.528]  Here's a little boil down of Samantha Bee and her worship fest of Schneiderman.
[02:51:29.548 --> 02:51:29.848]  Here it is.
[02:51:30.595 --> 02:51:36.296]  Today is November 8th, which means Donald Trump was elected president exactly 100 years ago.
[02:51:36.316 --> 02:51:37.836]  I'm kidding.
[02:51:37.916 --> 02:51:38.776]  It's only been a year.
[02:51:38.796 --> 02:51:40.377]  Oh my, where'd this come from?
[02:51:45.858 --> 02:51:49.218]  President Bonespur has had more endurance than predicted.
[02:51:49.458 --> 02:51:51.459]  Okay, so that's the intro to the original piece.
[02:51:51.479 --> 02:51:55.479]  Here's our little boil-down that our own John Gonzales put together.
[02:51:55.499 --> 02:51:57.600]  We've all heard of Spider-Man.
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.520]  Well, here's Schneiderman.
[02:51:59.161 --> 02:52:02.977]  We've been conducting an investigation for more than four months into...
[02:52:04.429 --> 02:52:20.620]  The Weinstein Company and our investigation, as demonstrated by the petition filed yesterday, uncovered a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment, intimidation, discrimination, and abuse at the Weinstein Company.
[02:52:21.841 --> 02:52:28.425]  This white mamba might be the one to save us.
[02:52:28.866 --> 02:52:32.748]  Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
[02:52:39.062 --> 02:52:41.706]  Have you forsaken us?
[02:52:55.490 --> 02:53:01.495]  How did the House of Cards, with you exposing him for over a decade, how did the House of Cards begin to fall for him?
[02:53:01.535 --> 02:53:07.800]  And now these four women close to him saying he's this demonic maniac, calling him racial slurs, brutalizing him.
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:15.126]  He says it's all just playtime, that he reportedly just runs around like you said, like a maniac, hitting on one woman after the next.
[02:53:15.646 --> 02:53:20.349]  He looks like the Joker, you know, out of DC Comics or Marvel, whatever it is.
[02:53:21.509 --> 02:53:23.210]  How did the House of Cards begin to unravel?
[02:53:23.490 --> 02:53:29.834]  I mean, I guess as he became more and more this big celebrity and took on the leadership of the Me Too movement, was it just too much for these women?
[02:53:31.274 --> 02:53:45.102]  I think what happens, and I have been in contact with other females who have been victims of sexual harassment by former senators and former assembly people, and I think what happens is they're
[02:53:45.649 --> 02:53:46.149]  Courage!
[02:53:46.970 --> 02:53:55.474]  These guys that are constantly victimizing people, constantly bullying people, threatening them with their jobs, they think they're untouchable.
[02:53:56.194 --> 02:54:02.197]  Even though that there's this underlying undulation of women finally saying enough is enough.
[02:54:02.397 --> 02:54:04.278]  And I think that was the fatal flaw.
[02:54:04.818 --> 02:54:14.483]  I think in recent weeks, I know I've spoken to the New York Times, I know that I've had numerous conversations with a former elected official's victims, Vito Lopez,
[02:54:15.114 --> 02:54:15.354]  Really?
[02:54:15.374 --> 02:54:15.534]  Hmm.
[02:54:34.522 --> 02:54:39.326]  I don't see that in the case with Bill Cosby, and I certainly don't see it in the case with Harvey Weinstein.
[02:54:39.646 --> 02:54:40.647]  Well, let's talk about this.
[02:54:40.807 --> 02:54:47.232]  How much credibility does it give it, though, that Trump, four years ago, tweeted that, oh, look at, you know, the governor getting caught.
[02:54:47.593 --> 02:54:49.754]  Look at, which is consensual.
[02:54:49.774 --> 02:54:50.635]  Suddenly we have an issue.
[02:54:50.655 --> 02:54:51.316]  Now he's a creep.
[02:54:51.636 --> 02:54:55.739]  And then you've got, you've got Weiner, the big pervert, going after underage girls.
[02:54:55.779 --> 02:54:57.861]  That is super evil and disgusting.
[02:54:57.901 --> 02:55:02.225]  But the point is, how known is Schneiderman that back when Trump put that out,
[02:55:03.145 --> 02:55:08.266]  You know, he wasn't even as powerful as he is now, so it sounds like Schneiderman is just known as a maniac.
[02:55:08.286 --> 02:55:10.947]  I mean, what other shoes do you think are gonna drop?
[02:55:11.227 --> 02:55:13.247]  What else do you know about Schneiderman?
[02:55:14.687 --> 02:55:18.508]  You know, I... Well, I think I'll say this.
[02:55:19.068 --> 02:55:28.730]  Now that he has left the building, New York State is a better place for it, and the females that work for New York State can finally begin to feel safer.
[02:55:28.970 --> 02:55:29.430]  Not safe,
[02:55:29.991 --> 02:55:33.393]  Because there's many creeps still around, and the cover-up still continues.
[02:55:33.793 --> 02:55:45.520]  So what I think this does is it begins to unravel this kind of yarn, this knitted kind of afghan that's been going on, where I'll cover your back if you cover mine.
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:47.841]  I think this begins the unraveling.
[02:55:48.562 --> 02:55:50.643]  And I do think that more victims are going to come out.
[02:55:51.203 --> 02:55:59.368]  And I had a sick feeling in my stomach thinking, I truly hope this hasn't reached a level of horrific violence.
[02:55:59.758 --> 02:56:00.780]  This is bad enough.
[02:56:01.582 --> 02:56:07.373]  I just hope that there wasn't some horrific activity going on.
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:17.345]  Well, they're a bunch of gangsters, and Cuomo's tied to it all as well, and his brother at CNN isn't just, on record, hit-and-run, and drunk, and then gets away with it because of who he is.
[02:56:17.365 --> 02:56:18.766]  Supposedly, it gets a lot worse.
[02:56:19.586 --> 02:56:30.672]  That's why they're trying to be the leaders of the MeToo movement, and put it out there, because they know they're so guilty of stuff that they hope that somehow gives them credibility as leaders of it, so no one will suspect that they're covering up for Harvey Weinstein.
[02:56:31.292 --> 02:56:31.872]  You name it.
[02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:34.234]  Any other points you'd like to make, Christy?
[02:56:36.104 --> 02:56:37.565]  Alex, you are spot on.
[02:56:37.765 --> 02:56:41.626]  And I watched and witnessed with my own position.
[02:56:42.506 --> 02:56:43.826]  It was a series of things.
[02:56:44.527 --> 02:56:46.767]  Once the heat started coming on, you were fired.
[02:56:47.748 --> 02:56:49.868]  Or you were told to quit.
[02:56:49.888 --> 02:56:55.110]  And anybody that you went to also had some skeletons and baggage.
[02:56:55.550 --> 02:57:02.572]  And as I mentioned to Roger, it was like Shane Roloff in the halls of the New York State Legislature.
[02:57:03.693 --> 02:57:03.833]  Wow.
[02:57:05.091 --> 02:57:08.614]  Hopefully come back with us to chronicle this as you've been exposing it from the beginning.
[02:57:08.634 --> 02:57:09.174]  A lot of courage.
[02:57:09.194 --> 02:57:10.295]  We appreciate that, Christy.
[02:57:10.315 --> 02:57:14.558]  Do people want to email you or call you or contact you or read what you've put out before?
[02:57:14.578 --> 02:57:15.959]  Where's the best place for them to visit?
[02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:20.522]  Google is a great place.
[02:57:20.582 --> 02:57:24.145]  I know that Google's giving me a problem with sharing some of my stuff.
[02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:32.395]  But my story is pretty well documented out there, and I've let Eric Schneiderman in the Attorney General's office take his swings first.
[02:57:33.436 --> 02:57:39.040]  They can reach out to me on Facebook through you folks there, and they're more than welcome to email me.
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:40.061]  All right.
[02:57:40.161 --> 02:57:42.862]  Christy Mazurek, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:57:43.123 --> 02:57:43.923]  We'll be in contact.
[02:57:43.943 --> 02:57:44.283]  Thank you.
[02:57:45.144 --> 02:57:45.604]  Thank you.
[02:57:46.145 --> 02:57:52.329]  Speaking of New York, Lionel is going to be co-hosting the 4th Hour with me, former prosecutor, author Mike

[03:00:44.758 --> 03:00:47.319]  Just doing a great job and I appreciate him hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:47.339 --> 03:00:50.581]  We're gonna be launching more syndicated shows soon on TV and cable.
[03:00:51.241 --> 03:00:55.803]  We already have gotten over 300 TV stations and now it's over 80 cable stations.
[03:00:56.263 --> 03:00:58.244]  Just as we went on some new satellites a few months ago.
[03:00:58.644 --> 03:01:00.525]  But they're all like, they're 10 hours a day live.
[03:01:01.564 --> 03:01:02.424]  You just re-air that?
[03:01:03.204 --> 03:01:06.205]  We really want you after 6 to go to at least Midnight Live.
[03:01:06.785 --> 03:01:12.647]  We want to just put you on a whole sub-channels we have and put a few hours of your main shows on our other channel and then promote it.
[03:01:14.127 --> 03:01:20.989]  You see, they've seen Sinclair make the move with billions of dollars with libertarian nationalist media into local TV.
[03:01:21.909 --> 03:01:25.090]  Just like in the late 70s, early 80s, AM was going out everywhere.
[03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:29.471]  Some smart folks went, we'll put conservative broadcasting, Roger Ailes,
[03:01:30.860 --> 03:01:31.421]  On AM.
[03:01:32.162 --> 03:01:33.743]  We'll be able to buy them up for nothing.
[03:01:34.844 --> 03:01:37.287]  We'll get the advertising and we'll relaunch a revolution.
[03:01:37.327 --> 03:01:39.989]  Not that Limbaugh's perfect, but it was a lot better than the Democrats and the Globalists.
[03:01:40.430 --> 03:01:41.391]  That was the internet of the day.
[03:01:42.412 --> 03:01:43.212]  Was AM radio.
[03:01:43.673 --> 03:01:47.257]  And now it's still there today because it's got something people can't find anywhere else.
[03:01:47.917 --> 03:01:52.161]  And then now they've got the FM translators and their own websites and it's a multimedia thing.
[03:01:52.362 --> 03:01:53.983]  That's what I came out of in the 90s.
[03:01:55.250 --> 03:01:58.012]  But now, I always thought, why have my own channel on cable?
[03:01:58.052 --> 03:02:01.475]  It's so expensive, it's like a glamour thing, and people just want it on demand anyways.
[03:02:01.715 --> 03:02:14.164]  I said, I want to go right to UHF, VHF, and they told me about five years ago, they go, oh, you can't, yeah, you can't have your own channel and then also go directly to UHF, VHF, and local cable under the rules because you get paid off the carriage rides, you got to pay for the channel.
[03:02:14.204 --> 03:02:14.945]  I said, that's a scam.
[03:02:15.865 --> 03:02:16.406]  I'm going to go.
[03:02:18.206 --> 03:02:24.509]  Directly to TV, directly to radio, directly to UHF, directly to VHF, directly to cable.
[03:02:25.029 --> 03:02:26.049]  But I never got around to it.
[03:02:26.089 --> 03:02:31.632]  Building studios, trying to hire people, got the wrong satellite a few years ago, only got on like, you know, 30-something stations.
[03:02:32.892 --> 03:02:34.033]  Now doing this, we hit it.
[03:02:34.093 --> 03:02:34.393]  It's like...
[03:02:35.822 --> 03:02:37.383]  And George Soros is upset.
[03:02:37.403 --> 03:02:38.923]  He's got articles out saying, shut me down.
[03:02:39.343 --> 03:02:40.104]  So here's the problem.
[03:02:40.144 --> 03:02:42.384]  They know we're launching right now.
[03:02:42.404 --> 03:02:43.185]  We're launching.
[03:02:43.225 --> 03:02:45.205]  They're trying to blow us up on the tarmac.
[03:02:45.886 --> 03:02:54.889]  But as soon as I get other shows ready and the crews hired to run them, we're going to try to go 20, 24 hours a day live by the end of the year because the stations want it.
[03:02:55.569 --> 03:03:04.251]  So hopefully Lionel and others will be part of these roundtable broadcasts, but I wanted to just briefly, and we're going to come back and I've got another question for him, and then he's going to take over, ask him, what do you think of that plan?
[03:03:04.271 --> 03:03:08.792]  Because they see Sinclair spending $2 billion to go Libertarian-Conservative-Local.
[03:03:09.032 --> 03:03:11.233]  That brings value to UHF-EHF-Cable.
[03:03:11.513 --> 03:03:12.253]  They know the model.
[03:03:12.313 --> 03:03:13.974]  That's got the Democrats totally panicking.
[03:03:14.194 --> 03:03:16.494]  Well, that's the model I intuitively wanted to follow.
[03:03:18.315 --> 03:03:23.856]  Well, not only does that scare them, but what's scaring them is that there is an existential threat
[03:03:24.594 --> 03:03:27.235]  That they are facing as to the usual platform.
[03:03:27.515 --> 03:03:45.904]  You know, Alex, I've been now this is my 30th year and I started in talk radio when Rush Limbaugh came about and before the conservative and I use that term just for shorthand purposes before conservative programming took over.
[03:03:46.524 --> 03:03:50.526]  Then once it became popular with Rush, everybody wanted to duplicate it.
[03:03:51.007 --> 03:03:53.728]  Well, now, as we're seeing regular
[03:03:54.631 --> 03:03:59.855]  Traditional mainstream media entertainment and news platforms are dying.
[03:04:00.316 --> 03:04:03.899]  They are facing, yet again, an existential threat.
[03:04:04.579 --> 03:04:16.950]  What you, and I'm not saying it just because you're here, but it helps, what you represent is something that is, forget the conservative message, it's beyond that.
[03:04:17.430 --> 03:04:21.733]  So it's not that people can say, oh, you want to hear the Alex Jones series or channel?
[03:04:21.994 --> 03:04:22.314]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:22.674 --> 03:04:23.415]  Is he conservative?
[03:04:24.282 --> 03:04:26.406]  Maybe it's bigger than that.
[03:04:26.987 --> 03:04:31.074]  Do you know that most people believe what we're saying?
[03:04:31.274 --> 03:04:32.997]  Forget we, you're saying.
[03:04:33.763 --> 03:04:36.184]  What you're doing is you're transcending left and right.
[03:04:36.605 --> 03:04:38.866]  And that's why I ask you to stay right there because this is so credible.
[03:04:39.446 --> 03:04:42.248]  They try to say we're Republican or Democrat, put us in a box.
[03:04:42.568 --> 03:04:43.909]  We're Sandy Hook deniers, which I'm not.
[03:04:44.409 --> 03:04:47.351]  They do that to hope to brand it because really it's just freedom.
[03:04:47.651 --> 03:04:58.578]  It's real diversity and you're about to see hundreds and hundreds of new shows on UHF VHF cable that aren't Alex Jones as people figure this out because they still have a monopoly on cable but not for long.
[03:04:58.598 --> 03:04:58.998]  We'll be back.
[03:05:03.644 --> 03:05:06.825]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:05:07.285 --> 03:05:08.605]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:05:09.086 --> 03:05:20.529]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:30.213]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:05:30.634 --> 03:05:36.476]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:05:36.696 --> 03:05:41.359]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:05:41.859 --> 03:05:44.180]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:45.801]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:05:46.241 --> 03:05:55.868]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:05:55.968 --> 03:05:58.110]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:05:58.650 --> 03:06:03.514]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:06:15.399 --> 03:06:19.293]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:19.875 --> 03:06:21.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:49.582 --> 03:06:55.633]  I was late getting back in the chair from that short break because they were handing me piles of new TV affiliates coming in.
[03:06:55.653 --> 03:06:59.480]  And saying, look at these, look at these, you gotta cut promos for all these.
[03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:00.341]  They all want promos.
[03:07:01.462 --> 03:07:08.644]  And we're talking about 20 station, 15 station group, 30 station group, 5 cable station group, 10 cable station group.
[03:07:09.424 --> 03:07:11.105]  Little towns, big cities, I don't care.
[03:07:11.225 --> 03:07:12.625]  And by the way, we're free to air.
[03:07:13.325 --> 03:07:18.187]  Meaning on the TV side, I want to work it on the radio too, all the ads, you can take them all.
[03:07:18.447 --> 03:07:20.367]  I'll just plug a few minutes each hour on products.
[03:07:20.868 --> 03:07:21.768]  Because I just want to reach people.
[03:07:21.788 --> 03:07:29.170]  So what Lionel's getting at here, prosecutor, lawyer, started out on talk radio, been on the top TV station in New York for many years.
[03:07:30.798 --> 03:07:54.717]  Is that, as they try to kick us off the internet, as they try to have total control over the cable channels, everyone just tunes out, and so UHF, VHF, and local cable, the basic cables figured out, what I've been saying for five years, put local programming on that's actually interesting, put a talk radio style format of taking calls, covering news, live and real, unscripted,
[03:07:56.090 --> 03:07:57.091]  It'll get huge ratings.
[03:07:57.311 --> 03:07:57.932]  Well, it is.
[03:07:58.012 --> 03:08:09.442]  But then every station can't pay or find their own host, so you have some local news mixed in with it, but then you have an Alex Jones or a Lionel, you know, or a Matt Drudge, if he was to come back, on and on and on.
[03:08:10.303 --> 03:08:18.711]  And all these great talents from talk radio that's consolidated and kicked them off, they just go now to their own programs to television, locally or nationally,
[03:08:19.051 --> 03:08:23.019]  And it's like AM radio was about to go bankrupt in the late 70s, 80s.
[03:08:23.299 --> 03:08:25.263]  Talk radio comes along in 1980, 81, 82.
[03:08:26.325 --> 03:08:28.750]  Bruce Fine, Rush Limbaugh, Roger Ailes.
[03:08:29.784 --> 03:08:40.269]  So now you see Sinclair, if Stacey has just joined us, I know I just said this earlier but some stations don't carry that five minutes, two billion dollars being invested in putting on nationalist conservative television locally.
[03:08:40.669 --> 03:08:44.611]  And the media acts like that's illegal, like in the controlled corporate leftist media.
[03:08:44.851 --> 03:08:48.853]  They go, oh look this is horrible, oh look Sinclair put out news packages that were pro-Trump.
[03:08:49.193 --> 03:08:50.934]  What do you think all the other news channels do?
[03:08:50.954 --> 03:08:53.495]  They put out pro-Hillary, anti-Trump packages.
[03:08:53.755 --> 03:08:55.156]  So yeah, they're packaging this.
[03:08:55.856 --> 03:08:58.077]  That's Sinclair though, not with InfoWars.
[03:08:58.357 --> 03:09:03.100]  This is the next level of openness and freeness and I thought they'd be hungry for it.
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:04.900]  It's like piranhas.
[03:09:05.501 --> 03:09:06.421]  They get results.
[03:09:06.501 --> 03:09:07.902]  The station owners are patriots.
[03:09:07.942 --> 03:09:10.223]  They get that we're not what CNN says we are.
[03:09:10.623 --> 03:09:12.144]  So we're reaching a critical tipping point.
[03:09:12.184 --> 03:09:12.624]  Here's the deal.
[03:09:12.984 --> 03:09:14.245]  They all have their own websites.
[03:09:14.505 --> 03:09:15.825]  They all have their own podcast.
[03:09:16.105 --> 03:09:17.206]  They all have their own things.
[03:09:17.266 --> 03:09:22.387]  And so when you're free to air, they pick you up, they repackage it and put it back out in whole or part.
[03:09:22.727 --> 03:09:25.268]  Now, they think they're censoring you on the web.
[03:09:25.528 --> 03:09:32.109]  You're all over these other platforms going out on the web as well, and it becomes a total synergy building those communities.
[03:09:32.129 --> 03:09:36.290]  So, Lionel, I wanted to get your take on this, and then I wanted to move on to one other subject as you take over.
[03:09:37.251 --> 03:09:37.851]  Well, a couple of things.
[03:09:37.891 --> 03:09:40.632]  What you're talking about, Alex, is doing almost modular programming.
[03:09:40.652 --> 03:09:42.172]  You know, in the old days, we called it a donut.
[03:09:42.910 --> 03:09:43.591]  I'll give you an example.
[03:09:43.731 --> 03:09:46.973]  Years ago, remember there was a guy named Jim Dance, our dance brother?
[03:09:47.053 --> 03:09:49.275]  He was a fisherman or something.
[03:09:49.315 --> 03:09:50.236]  He had a Tennessee hat.
[03:09:50.276 --> 03:09:50.476]  Yes.
[03:09:51.377 --> 03:09:56.361]  This guy years ago would say, listen, I will go to a radio station or TV station.
[03:09:56.521 --> 03:09:57.562]  I'll give you my show.
[03:09:57.962 --> 03:09:59.363]  Just give me two minutes of commercials.
[03:09:59.744 --> 03:10:03.727]  And I'll make deals with Shakespeare, Rods and Reals, or Evan Rood.
[03:10:03.867 --> 03:10:05.268]  The guy made a fortune!
[03:10:05.528 --> 03:10:07.850]  And they said, you can't make money selling fishing.
[03:10:08.170 --> 03:10:08.611]  Oh yeah?
[03:10:09.211 --> 03:10:10.132]  Well, here you come along.
[03:10:10.152 --> 03:10:18.435]  And by the way, that's what I thought about that guy who was on every channel in Dallas when I was a kid, and in every hotel room I ever got in for a decade later in any other city.
[03:10:18.735 --> 03:10:29.040]  I thought, hey, direct sale, when they started taking my sponsors ten years ago, their attacks on me made us innovate, and you just literally picked my brain about who I was inspired by.
[03:10:30.465 --> 03:10:33.326]  He always amazed me when somebody comes along.
[03:10:33.606 --> 03:10:34.826]  Let me also tell you something, Alex.
[03:10:35.106 --> 03:10:36.466]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:10:36.907 --> 03:10:46.409]  If you go to anybody of any of the supposed liberal bastions, whether it's Moonves or Iger or whoever is in charge of NBC, I don't know.
[03:10:46.909 --> 03:10:50.830]  And you said, listen, businessman to businessman, here's what I'm doing.
[03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:51.990]  They'll say, we're in.
[03:10:52.643 --> 03:10:53.304]  We're in.
[03:10:53.624 --> 03:10:54.504]  Look at Roseanne.
[03:10:54.725 --> 03:10:55.965]  Look at Roseanne and Bob Iger.
[03:10:55.985 --> 03:10:57.146]  How smart they are on ABC.
[03:10:57.727 --> 03:10:58.867]  Tim Allen's coming back.
[03:10:59.828 --> 03:11:00.408]  It works.
[03:11:00.669 --> 03:11:02.170]  They don't care about this.
[03:11:02.410 --> 03:11:06.052]  If you think they're ideologically connected, you're nuts.
[03:11:06.473 --> 03:11:14.038]  Because what you're going to do is, but the only thing you've got to do, Alex, remember I'm telling you this, and if you ever violate this, I will haunt you.
[03:11:14.518 --> 03:11:15.199]  I will haunt you.
[03:11:15.219 --> 03:11:20.022]  And if I pre-disease you, I will walk through your house with chains and haunt you day and night.
[03:11:20.794 --> 03:11:24.381]  You've got to give them more Alex than you've ever done.
[03:11:24.622 --> 03:11:25.724]  You can't dilute it.
[03:11:26.125 --> 03:11:29.111]  The moment somebody says, you know, could you just?
[03:11:29.351 --> 03:11:29.772]  That's it.
[03:11:29.932 --> 03:11:30.213]  I'm out.
[03:11:30.945 --> 03:11:34.428]  Because they want you to be bigger than ever.
[03:11:35.049 --> 03:11:37.611]  I know a lot about, also, professional wrestling.
[03:11:37.951 --> 03:11:39.412]  You talk about professional wrestling.
[03:11:39.833 --> 03:11:44.317]  NASCAR, name the particular, these quote, niche programming.
[03:11:44.577 --> 03:11:45.758]  That is so big!
[03:11:45.978 --> 03:11:47.059]  Talk to Vince McMahon about that.
[03:11:47.079 --> 03:11:48.921]  I was about to say, I was about to say, none of it's niche.
[03:11:49.261 --> 03:11:53.405]  The big centralizers, like I've told Clear Channel, guaranteed models.
[03:11:53.965 --> 03:11:56.948]  Instead of them, you know, going bankrupt, we could triple their profits.
[03:11:57.248 --> 03:11:58.149]  They know that, too.
[03:11:58.809 --> 03:12:04.131]  And they won't do it because they're owned by big global corporations that want it all to fail.
[03:12:04.431 --> 03:12:07.051]  They want it to be all about the big centralized ad agencies.
[03:12:08.532 --> 03:12:11.853]  But instead, they won't give in to reality, so they're all dying.
[03:12:12.313 --> 03:12:14.773]  They're all dying, and it's totally insane.
[03:12:15.434 --> 03:12:16.654]  Let me show you how stupid this is.
[03:12:16.894 --> 03:12:18.915]  You know about the no-buy list, right?
[03:12:18.975 --> 03:12:19.815]  You've heard about that?
[03:12:20.235 --> 03:12:20.455]  Okay.
[03:12:20.915 --> 03:12:23.836]  There are companies, there are people like, for example, Michael Savage.
[03:12:24.759 --> 03:12:31.783]  They're into the control and they're into thinking they're part of the establishment by joining these elites that are actually screwing them over.
[03:12:31.803 --> 03:12:33.424]  That's what CNN, MSNBC, they're all about.
[03:12:47.031 --> 03:12:48.513]  We tell you who you can have on.
[03:12:48.813 --> 03:12:50.375]  We tell you who you can go on.
[03:12:50.655 --> 03:12:54.319]  We tell, you know, people like Ben Shapiro, don't go on Alex Jones' show.
[03:12:54.379 --> 03:12:55.460]  It's all about gatekeeping.
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:12:56.881]  That brings me to this next video.
[03:12:56.921 --> 03:13:03.668]  Here is Cuomo with his corrupt brother covering up for Weinstein and all the rest of it through the AG, which you're going to cover, I know, coming up.
[03:13:05.390 --> 03:13:07.751]  He says, oh, you can't be on with Alex Jones.
[03:13:07.791 --> 03:13:09.091]  He says Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[03:13:09.352 --> 03:13:11.893]  Totally out of context, twisting what I said, blah, blah, blah.
[03:13:12.353 --> 03:13:13.853]  So it's like, oh, that's the bad guy.
[03:13:13.873 --> 03:13:22.937]  And then Stone's talking about censorship, but here they are trying to brand that we're these evil people, when it's CNN that lied us into a war that killed millions of people.
[03:13:22.977 --> 03:13:23.277]  Here it is.
[03:13:24.386 --> 03:13:27.549]  What do you say is the best reason to read Roger Stone's book?
[03:13:27.869 --> 03:13:35.455]  Well, what's interesting to me is when I post the link to buy this book on Google, within hours, they call it spam.
[03:13:35.755 --> 03:13:42.860]  When I post an ad to buy it at Amazon or Barnes & Noble, they call it, you know, they reject the ad.
[03:13:43.301 --> 03:13:46.743]  This kind of internet censorship is very, very dangerous.
[03:13:46.803 --> 03:13:48.425]  It's what we're experiencing and for worse.
[03:13:48.865 --> 03:13:49.706]  I do a show that...
[03:13:50.046 --> 03:13:50.826]  By the way, who is?
[03:13:51.407 --> 03:13:52.147]  The tech left.
[03:13:52.367 --> 03:13:53.808]  The large tech left?
[03:13:53.888 --> 03:13:54.448]  Yes, indeed.
[03:13:54.929 --> 03:13:57.230]  So, I do a show, as you do, five days a week.
[03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.990]  It's a lot of work.
[03:13:58.471 --> 03:14:03.213]  I can't get my show loaded on YouTube, my InfoWars show, because it's controversial.
[03:14:03.533 --> 03:14:04.394]  I'm against censorship.
[03:14:04.414 --> 03:14:06.355]  You know what the problem is with InfoWars.
[03:14:06.395 --> 03:14:10.477]  You know what Alex Jones has done in the interest of publicity.
[03:14:10.517 --> 03:14:12.679]  And you're familiar with the First Amendment, I believe.
[03:14:12.979 --> 03:14:13.119]  Yeah.
[03:14:13.519 --> 03:14:15.721]  Well, on that basis, I don't think anybody should be saying it.
[03:14:15.741 --> 03:14:18.623]  Just because you have the right to say something doesn't mean it's right to say it.
[03:14:18.723 --> 03:14:20.204]  Millions and millions of people are watching.
[03:14:20.244 --> 03:14:21.606]  Him smearing the Newtown people?
[03:14:21.626 --> 03:14:22.766]  You can't be on board with that.
[03:14:22.887 --> 03:14:27.290]  I disagree with some of the things he has said, but even he has backed off that.
[03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:34.296]  The point is censorship, and we're struggling to stay alive because we can be arbitrarily censored, and that is dangerous.
[03:14:35.302 --> 03:14:37.263]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you for making the case.
[03:14:37.283 --> 03:14:41.826]  Your book is Stone's Rules, How to Win in Politics, Business, and Style.
[03:14:42.206 --> 03:14:44.247]  Roger Stone, thank you very much for being here.
[03:14:44.347 --> 03:14:58.015]  The book is available at Infowarsstore.com, but just how they don't show it, I supposedly say, any of it, oh, he's the bad guy, you're not allowed to, you know, he deserves to be preemptively censored, but once they set that precedent, it's everybody.
[03:14:58.615 --> 03:15:00.036]  Once we're all deplatformed, Lionel.
[03:15:01.226 --> 03:15:09.918]  You know, one of the things which I would love for you to do one time, and it's easy for me to say this because it's your money, but I'd love to say, okay, tell you what you do.
[03:15:10.479 --> 03:15:15.526]  Let's get an amount and you pick the charity of your choice and I'll pick the charity of my choice, whatever it is.
[03:15:16.915 --> 03:15:22.096]  Show me where I said whatever it is you think I said, because I'm telling you I didn't say it.
[03:15:22.637 --> 03:15:23.057]  Repeat.
[03:15:23.637 --> 03:15:28.758]  It's a blanket... Show me where I say there's Martian bases with human slaves.
[03:15:29.218 --> 03:15:31.399]  Never said it.
[03:15:31.419 --> 03:15:31.399]  $100,000.
[03:15:31.459 --> 03:15:32.239]  Show me where I said it.
[03:15:32.279 --> 03:15:32.799]  They can't do it.
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:42.382]  Or better yet, listen Cuomo, I don't even know what you think I said, but I know I didn't say it.
[03:15:43.343 --> 03:15:50.948]  I know that whatever you think I said, I didn't say it, so I dare you to tell me, because you don't listen to me!
[03:15:52.689 --> 03:15:53.089]  Exactly.
[03:15:53.149 --> 03:15:53.950]  Lionel's coming up.
[03:15:54.010 --> 03:15:55.571]  He's loaded for bear on the other side.
[03:15:55.891 --> 03:15:56.932]  LionelMedia.com.
[03:15:57.032 --> 03:15:57.952]  NewsWars.com.
[03:15:58.333 --> 03:15:59.853]  Spread all the live video links, folks.
[03:15:59.894 --> 03:16:00.394]  It's critical.
[03:16:05.851 --> 03:16:08.333]  Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[03:16:08.433 --> 03:16:11.474]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[03:16:11.554 --> 03:16:14.376]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[03:16:14.436 --> 03:16:15.917]  What is the latest from the UK?
[03:16:16.037 --> 03:16:24.582]  Look, remember in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[03:16:24.602 --> 03:16:28.784]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[03:16:28.824 --> 03:16:31.486]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[03:16:31.586 --> 03:16:33.147]  It would have been mad!
[03:16:33.727 --> 03:16:41.431]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[03:16:41.471 --> 03:16:43.872]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[03:16:44.452 --> 03:16:46.193]  Trust Middle England.
[03:16:46.614 --> 03:16:48.054]  Trust Middle America.
[03:16:48.074 --> 03:16:51.856]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[03:16:52.196 --> 03:16:56.078]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[03:16:56.618 --> 03:16:57.519]  All I can tell her
[03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:06.888]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[03:17:06.908 --> 03:17:07.969]  Let's put it like this.
[03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:17.359]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:23.200]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:36.463]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[03:17:36.503 --> 03:17:38.583]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[03:17:38.803 --> 03:17:39.903]  You're a leading expert on this.
[03:17:39.983 --> 03:17:41.864]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[03:17:42.104 --> 03:17:43.024]  Why are they trying to flood?
[03:17:44.124 --> 03:17:45.265]  Because they hate Christianity.
[03:17:45.905 --> 03:17:56.870]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[03:17:56.930 --> 03:17:57.750]  They deny that.
[03:17:58.170 --> 03:18:01.832]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[03:18:01.892 --> 03:18:03.092]  They want to get rid of it.
[03:18:03.593 --> 03:18:06.014]  They want to replace it with the globalist project.
[03:18:06.314 --> 03:18:11.536]  And the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[03:18:11.856 --> 03:18:13.597]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[03:18:14.332 --> 03:18:19.533]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[03:18:19.573 --> 03:18:25.595]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[03:18:25.895 --> 03:18:34.177]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[03:18:34.217 --> 03:18:39.959]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[03:18:39.999 --> 03:18:41.159]  And look, what's really happening here?
[03:18:41.659 --> 03:18:43.480]  You know, don't underestimate
[03:18:44.060 --> 03:18:47.123]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[03:18:47.383 --> 03:18:48.444]  The victory of Brexit.
[03:18:48.725 --> 03:18:49.646]  The victory of Trump.
[03:18:50.266 --> 03:18:51.127]  You know, we're winning.
[03:18:51.467 --> 03:18:52.528]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[03:18:52.768 --> 03:19:00.396]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[03:19:00.476 --> 03:19:01.277]  And you know something?
[03:19:01.817 --> 03:19:02.618]  If we can resist,
[03:19:03.417 --> 03:19:12.545]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[03:19:12.585 --> 03:19:14.306]  So don't get down, everybody.
[03:19:14.607 --> 03:19:15.467]  Don't get depressed.
[03:19:15.788 --> 03:19:18.290]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[03:19:19.127 --> 03:19:24.869]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops.
[03:19:25.209 --> 03:19:28.030]  And you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[03:19:28.290 --> 03:19:28.950]  You're amazing.
[03:19:29.170 --> 03:19:29.870]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:31.291]  I know you're very busy.
[03:19:31.311 --> 03:19:35.192]  But that's as the EU has said, they'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[03:19:35.232 --> 03:19:38.613]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[03:19:39.868 --> 03:19:52.512]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[03:19:52.872 --> 03:19:58.353]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[03:19:58.833 --> 03:20:00.174]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[03:20:06.295 --> 03:20:10.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.698 --> 03:20:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:30.761]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[03:20:30.881 --> 03:20:33.222]  Alrighty, Lionel back with you.
[03:20:34.119 --> 03:20:35.020]  Is that Rockwell?
[03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:38.002]  Somebody's watching me!
[03:20:38.442 --> 03:20:40.163]  That's my Ethel Merman.
[03:20:41.865 --> 03:20:44.987]  I want to pick up where I left off with Alex.
[03:20:45.247 --> 03:20:52.152]  And this is so, so critical because sometimes it's very important for us to figure out exactly just what it is we're talking about.
[03:20:53.092 --> 03:20:54.393]  Because I hate labels.
[03:20:54.854 --> 03:20:59.937]  Once you label something, then you spend your time deciding whether you're in the label.
[03:21:00.538 --> 03:21:03.460]  It's like, for example, I'm a country music fan.
[03:21:04.321 --> 03:21:06.564]  George Jones is my, is, is God.
[03:21:07.024 --> 03:21:07.825]  I mean, God!
[03:21:08.666 --> 03:21:11.249]  Not to be disrespectful to God, of course, or to George Jones.
[03:21:11.950 --> 03:21:16.114]  And I got friends of mine that say, yeah, but do you think that maybe Johnny Cash, is it more of a torch and twang?
[03:21:16.335 --> 03:21:17.656]  Is it more of a rockabilly?
[03:21:17.876 --> 03:21:19.118]  Would you, I said, would you stop?
[03:21:19.198 --> 03:21:20.820]  Who cares what it's called?
[03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:22.201]  I just like it.
[03:21:22.562 --> 03:21:23.102]  That's it.
[03:21:23.843 --> 03:21:24.564]  Now leave me alone.
[03:21:25.527 --> 03:21:26.507]  Is it conservative?
[03:21:26.747 --> 03:21:28.568]  Is it libertarian?
[03:21:28.868 --> 03:21:30.408]  Are you paleo-conservative?
[03:21:30.648 --> 03:21:32.808]  Are you more of a Rockefeller Republican?
[03:21:32.948 --> 03:21:34.369]  I don't even know what that means!
[03:21:34.589 --> 03:21:35.369]  I don't know!
[03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:37.389]  I hate these labels!
[03:21:38.509 --> 03:21:43.950]  What I love, and what I think you love, is this thing called the truth.
[03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:48.471]  This brutal, unvarnished truth.
[03:21:49.391 --> 03:21:53.432]  And you hear people say, you know, I don't want any bias in the media.
[03:21:53.852 --> 03:21:54.692]  And that sounds good.
[03:21:55.305 --> 03:21:57.586]  But I think what we're trying to say is something a little bit different.
[03:21:58.167 --> 03:22:01.148]  I want analysis.
[03:22:01.389 --> 03:22:05.611]  If I think I broke my leg, and some doctor hands me an x-ray and says, what do you think?
[03:22:05.651 --> 03:22:07.552]  I say, well, I don't know what this is.
[03:22:07.792 --> 03:22:08.673]  Well, it's the truth.
[03:22:09.353 --> 03:22:10.594]  Yeah, but I don't know how to read this.
[03:22:11.154 --> 03:22:12.515]  Well, let me get the x-ray tech.
[03:22:12.535 --> 03:22:13.796]  Let me get a radiologist in here.
[03:22:13.916 --> 03:22:14.677]  He'll help you.
[03:22:15.357 --> 03:22:18.879]  He'll comment and analyze the truth.
[03:22:19.159 --> 03:22:20.060]  That's what we're doing.
[03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:21.060]  It's what I'm doing.
[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:22.241]  It's what I'd like to think I'm doing.
[03:22:22.841 --> 03:22:23.722]  May not be perfect.
[03:22:24.542 --> 03:22:28.625]  Because I don't want somebody just telling me, just handing me something and saying, you figure it out.
[03:22:29.005 --> 03:22:31.767]  Sometimes I need somebody to say, what does this mean?
[03:22:32.608 --> 03:22:34.589]  And you take a risk with that, I realize that.
[03:22:35.410 --> 03:22:38.312]  But I want you to understand that's what I like.
[03:22:38.913 --> 03:22:40.013]  And I like what Alex says.
[03:22:40.093 --> 03:22:41.274]  I like what Alex tells me.
[03:22:42.055 --> 03:22:42.835]  What does that mean?
[03:22:43.256 --> 03:22:44.857]  I don't know when this was.
[03:22:45.603 --> 03:22:56.174]  And I know right now the telepathic staff is so incredible, because I'm on with David Knight, and sometimes I'll say something, and the words aren't even out of my mouth, and they've got the graphic of the story that I'm talking about.
[03:22:56.234 --> 03:22:59.017]  And how they do this, I have no idea.
[03:22:59.197 --> 03:22:59.778]  And it's scary.
[03:22:59.798 --> 03:23:00.879]  But I'll give you an example.
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:08.187]  Years ago, and I don't know when, I was listening to Alex, and he talked about, and he says, you know,
[03:23:09.495 --> 03:23:11.516]  Um, I think it might have been Comcast.
[03:23:11.697 --> 03:23:12.137]  I don't know.
[03:23:12.197 --> 03:23:17.660]  But they're listening in to you on your home cable boxes.
[03:23:18.421 --> 03:23:21.783]  And I thought, and I never, I never questioned him.
[03:23:21.863 --> 03:23:22.503]  At first I did.
[03:23:22.543 --> 03:23:24.084]  I thought, this guy's making this up.
[03:23:24.664 --> 03:23:25.465]  They don't do that.
[03:23:25.765 --> 03:23:31.649]  Well, that lasted about a couple hours until they kept handing us these stories one after another.
[03:23:32.069 --> 03:23:34.890]  This was 15 years ago.
[03:23:35.091 --> 03:23:35.871]  I don't even know.
[03:23:35.891 --> 03:23:37.192]  I don't even know.
[03:23:38.812 --> 03:23:41.494]  And I thought to myself, this is amazing.
[03:23:42.295 --> 03:23:44.577]  Look at this.
[03:23:44.597 --> 03:23:44.577]  2013.
[03:23:46.959 --> 03:23:54.184]  And I could have sworn it was even before, that could have been yet, there was a story even before that, I'm thinking 95.
[03:23:54.445 --> 03:23:55.385]  I know it sounds crazy.
[03:23:56.826 --> 03:23:58.388]  But it was one story after another.
[03:23:58.408 --> 03:24:00.649]  And the first time I met Alex, I gotta tell you this.
[03:24:02.071 --> 03:24:04.533]  It was in New York, there was an event called the Talkers Magazine.
[03:24:05.173 --> 03:24:06.294]  It's a yearly summit.
[03:24:07.119 --> 03:24:08.280]  All the talk radio people.
[03:24:08.340 --> 03:24:16.986]  And I said, listen, I asked the publisher at the time, please let me introduce Alex, please.
[03:24:17.447 --> 03:24:18.667]  You gotta let me do it.
[03:24:19.348 --> 03:24:19.968]  OK, I will.
[03:24:20.048 --> 03:24:21.229]  No, you don't understand.
[03:24:21.529 --> 03:24:24.852]  There can be no mistake, no room for error.
[03:24:25.112 --> 03:24:29.055]  OK, now let go of my throat because I get kind of excited.
[03:24:29.810 --> 03:24:33.953]  And the first time I met him, I said, you are in good hands.
[03:24:34.233 --> 03:24:37.436]  Because the first time Alex looked at me, he looked at me like, who the hell is this guy?
[03:24:37.456 --> 03:24:38.637]  Because these people don't know.
[03:24:39.217 --> 03:24:40.558]  They've been doing talk radio.
[03:24:40.578 --> 03:24:42.280]  They're a bunch of scaredy cats.
[03:24:42.860 --> 03:24:44.602]  Talk radio is dying.
[03:24:45.122 --> 03:24:46.483]  It's dying.
[03:24:47.044 --> 03:24:48.585]  It used to be so exciting.
[03:24:49.285 --> 03:24:52.168]  But I walked up and I said, let me, I introduced him and I'm in this room.
[03:24:52.348 --> 03:24:53.408]  We're right there on 3rd Avenue.
[03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:54.069]  Don't forget this.
[03:24:54.730 --> 03:24:57.712]  I said, let me tell you one thing among others.
[03:24:58.305 --> 03:25:00.106]  That Alex does, which I love with the most.
[03:25:00.726 --> 03:25:02.147]  I'm a lawyer by profession.
[03:25:02.287 --> 03:25:02.907]  Trial lawyer.
[03:25:03.027 --> 03:25:04.408]  I love citation.
[03:25:04.608 --> 03:25:06.669]  Don't just tell me that's what the law is.
[03:25:07.089 --> 03:25:08.009]  Show me the law.
[03:25:08.650 --> 03:25:12.391]  Don't tell me what you think your interpretation of the Second Amendment is.
[03:25:12.851 --> 03:25:13.492]  Show me.
[03:25:14.172 --> 03:25:14.712]  Cite it.
[03:25:15.132 --> 03:25:16.053]  Chapter and verse.
[03:25:16.913 --> 03:25:22.916]  Whether he knows it or not, whether he's just inadvertently doing it, he always gives citation.
[03:25:23.536 --> 03:25:24.376]  Here's the story.
[03:25:24.617 --> 03:25:25.117]  Just now.
[03:25:26.117 --> 03:25:27.698]  It's a part of the show.
[03:25:28.536 --> 03:25:32.077]  Alex's middle name is, don't take my word for it, this is what's happened.
[03:25:32.157 --> 03:25:33.338]  This is what somebody's saying.
[03:25:33.518 --> 03:25:34.838]  And that's some fly-by-night.
[03:25:35.418 --> 03:25:39.940]  That's some kid in the middle of his basement covered in Cheeto dust with a laptop.
[03:25:40.220 --> 03:25:44.001]  These are somewhat, and quasi sometimes, legitimate stories.
[03:25:45.221 --> 03:25:49.622]  And I remember at the time, people in the room, they were looking around like, this guy's crazy.
[03:25:49.722 --> 03:25:50.443]  You've heard this!
[03:25:50.803 --> 03:25:53.184]  That Alex Jones, he's crazy!
[03:25:53.924 --> 03:25:54.544]  I love this.
[03:25:55.191 --> 03:25:57.213]  And I found myself saying, crazy, huh?
[03:25:57.833 --> 03:25:58.894]  Name one thing.
[03:25:59.194 --> 03:25:59.574]  Go ahead.
[03:25:59.695 --> 03:26:02.317]  And I know that they don't know what they're talking about.
[03:26:02.337 --> 03:26:06.720]  You see, because what we do is we believe stuff and we repeat stuff.
[03:26:06.940 --> 03:26:07.661]  Let me explain.
[03:26:07.821 --> 03:26:08.722]  What do I mean by that?
[03:26:09.742 --> 03:26:13.325]  There are things that we say sometimes and we don't even know why we say it.
[03:26:13.585 --> 03:26:14.346]  We just say them.
[03:26:14.846 --> 03:26:19.290]  We just say them because we think we know what we're talking about.
[03:26:20.351 --> 03:26:21.311]  A friend of mine is a physician.
[03:26:21.351 --> 03:26:23.093]  He told me in medical school there was this one
[03:26:24.238 --> 03:26:26.720]  Professor who told him, how do you know what you know?
[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:29.261]  How do you know this?
[03:26:31.062 --> 03:26:35.965]  How do you know Alex Jones is whatever, like Cuomo just did with Roger Stone.
[03:26:36.045 --> 03:26:36.706]  How do you know?
[03:26:37.226 --> 03:26:38.347]  What exactly was it?
[03:26:38.487 --> 03:26:38.967]  I don't know.
[03:26:39.267 --> 03:26:43.550]  I, I just kind of, well, I, I heard.
[03:26:43.730 --> 03:26:44.911]  Yeah, but one in particular.
[03:26:45.051 --> 03:26:45.451]  Name it.
[03:26:45.931 --> 03:26:46.672]  I've got time.
[03:26:47.092 --> 03:26:47.472]  Tell me.
[03:26:48.633 --> 03:26:51.234]  Well, you know, he just says stuff.
[03:26:51.294 --> 03:26:52.255]  What does he say?
[03:26:54.741 --> 03:26:57.542]  Well, you know, and they don't know.
[03:26:58.762 --> 03:27:04.643]  Because within his community, this particular meme, this trope, this idea, it's just passed around.
[03:27:05.704 --> 03:27:09.464]  And the thing that I and I'm telling you, and I don't know if I've ever told you this.
[03:27:10.005 --> 03:27:13.165]  See, I was red pilled on 9-11.
[03:27:13.485 --> 03:27:16.906]  I was here in New York and my world changed.
[03:27:18.207 --> 03:27:20.127]  But I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[03:27:20.487 --> 03:27:22.648]  I didn't even know what I was seeing.
[03:27:23.168 --> 03:27:24.448]  I was traumatized.
[03:27:25.186 --> 03:27:40.132]  I mean, it was a surreal, you will never, I will never be able to tell you what it is like, what it was like when you're in this city and the whole world is looking at you and I'm thinking, is this a movie set?
[03:27:40.352 --> 03:27:41.993]  Is this, is this happening?
[03:27:42.013 --> 03:27:44.714]  This is, this is not supposed to be happening.
[03:27:45.434 --> 03:27:50.476]  The smell, the smell of this pretty, for days it was everywhere.
[03:27:51.456 --> 03:27:53.057]  Just, it would, believe me.
[03:27:53.795 --> 03:27:55.796]  It was like a night of the living dead.
[03:27:55.976 --> 03:27:57.277]  People were zombified.
[03:27:58.577 --> 03:28:00.858]  And I remember at the time saying, you know, I don't understand.
[03:28:00.899 --> 03:28:03.120]  There's something that doesn't make any sense.
[03:28:03.820 --> 03:28:10.383]  I'm here and I see what's going on, but I'm looking out on the news and I don't know.
[03:28:11.644 --> 03:28:12.324]  I don't see it.
[03:28:13.084 --> 03:28:14.145]  And this was before Alex.
[03:28:14.185 --> 03:28:16.246]  I heard about Alex, kind of, but I didn't.
[03:28:17.367 --> 03:28:20.808]  He didn't mean as much to me as he would then.
[03:28:21.529 --> 03:28:22.349]  And I remember at the time,
[03:28:24.770 --> 03:28:30.992]  I'll never forget, I was on the air and we're talking, we're just talking, and I happened to look at something and they kept talking about this flight 93.
[03:28:31.092 --> 03:28:47.977]  I remember I'm going crazy, but when we return, I will explain to you how this moment happened, why Alex is critical, why InfoWars is critical, why all of this is critical, and why you must do everything in your power to support it.
[03:28:48.857 --> 03:28:49.297]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:02.133 --> 03:29:09.801]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:10.702 --> 03:29:14.746]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:15.247 --> 03:29:17.589]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:18.390 --> 03:29:21.514]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:23.021 --> 03:29:35.147]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:35.848 --> 03:29:50.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:51.916 --> 03:29:55.597]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsTore.com what it could do for your family.
[03:29:55.617 --> 03:29:57.878]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:57.898 --> 03:30:00.718]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:30:03.799 --> 03:30:04.259]  Good morning.
[03:30:04.739 --> 03:30:05.819]  My name is Andrew Grossman.
[03:30:06.199 --> 03:30:08.140]  I'm a partner at the law firm Baker Hostetler.
[03:30:08.300 --> 03:30:12.141]  I represent Alex and InfoWars in the lawsuit that was filed by Brendan Gilmore.
[03:30:12.421 --> 03:30:21.103]  This morning, we asked the District Court to dismiss Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit, to require Mr. Gilmore to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding to his lawsuit,
[03:30:21.523 --> 03:30:26.445]  And to sanction Mr. Gilmour for using a federal court to wage a publicity stunt.
[03:30:26.485 --> 03:30:28.026]  Now let me be clear about this.
[03:30:28.406 --> 03:30:32.128]  Mr. Gilmour's claims against Alex Jones and Infowars are legally defective.
[03:30:32.348 --> 03:30:35.649]  We are confident that the suit will be thrown out of court.
[03:30:36.049 --> 03:30:39.631]  But make no mistake, vexatious lawsuits like this one are dangerous.
[03:30:40.351 --> 03:30:43.033]  Because they seek to chip away at our cherished First Amendment rights.
[03:30:43.453 --> 03:30:47.056]  The First Amendment gives all Americans the right to have their say on today's news.
[03:30:47.516 --> 03:30:56.723]  Alex Jones thought it was strange that Mr. Gilmour was popping up in all the media coverage on the events in Charlottesville, with what seemed like the same anti-Trump talking points every time.
[03:30:56.743 --> 03:30:59.705]  And that is exactly what Mr. Jones questioned.
[03:30:59.725 --> 03:31:04.829]  Was the media, with Mr. Gilmour's eager assistance, spinning the story against President Trump?
[03:31:05.649 --> 03:31:13.880]  That is the kind of probing question that every cable news analyst, every columnist, and every American who cares about what's going on in this country asks every day.
[03:31:14.480 --> 03:31:18.225]  They try to make sense of what they see reported in the news, and then they say what they think.
[03:31:18.706 --> 03:31:21.449]  The First Amendment absolutely protects that speech.
[03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:23.131]  Now, Mr. Gilmour disagrees.
[03:31:23.792 --> 03:31:27.075]  He obviously opposes Alex Jones's political viewpoint.
[03:31:27.595 --> 03:31:32.800]  He says that InfoWars is not what he considers to be responsible journalism and that it can therefore be suppressed.
[03:31:33.440 --> 03:31:39.686]  His lawyers say that the law should distinguish between speech that informs the public and speech that they think misinforms the public.
[03:31:40.166 --> 03:31:49.373]  But the whole point of the First Amendment is that people like Mr. Gilmour and his lawyers do not get to decide whether their political opponents are allowed to have a voice.
[03:31:49.954 --> 03:31:53.557]  They do not get to decide what the public is allowed to hear.
[03:31:54.097 --> 03:32:00.482]  That fundamental misunderstanding of our First Amendment rights is just one of the reasons that Mr. Gilmour's suit has to be thrown out.
[03:32:00.803 --> 03:32:04.826]  As a matter of principle, no one should be able to drag their political opponents
[03:32:05.166 --> 03:32:12.152]  And that's why we're asking the court to find that Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit is what the law calls a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
[03:32:12.232 --> 03:32:16.215]  If the court agrees, Mr. Gilmore will be required to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding.
[03:32:32.368 --> 03:32:34.830]  And will be subject to additional monetary sanctions.
[03:32:35.491 --> 03:32:37.812]  Mr. Gilmour brought these consequences on himself.
[03:32:38.413 --> 03:32:43.136]  He left it the chance to file a lawsuit instead of exercising his own First Amendment rights to talk back.
[03:32:43.857 --> 03:32:56.867]  We can only hope that he will come to understand the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' words, that when it comes to fighting perceived falsehoods and fallacies, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.
[03:32:57.447 --> 03:32:58.968]  And with that, I'll turn it back to Alex.
[03:32:59.208 --> 03:32:59.489]  Thank you.
[03:33:06.236 --> 03:33:08.855]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.666 --> 03:33:24.788]  You want answers?
[03:33:24.808 --> 03:33:31.652]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:31.752 --> 03:33:35.454]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:35.514 --> 03:33:36.455]  I'm honored to be here.
[03:33:36.475 --> 03:33:37.776]  Honored to be here.
[03:33:37.796 --> 03:33:39.257]  I want to pick up where I left off.
[03:33:40.257 --> 03:33:41.598]  You know, we all go through these moments.
[03:33:41.618 --> 03:33:43.339]  I don't want to keep calling it the red pill moment.
[03:33:43.539 --> 03:33:45.380]  But you know what I'm talking about.
[03:33:45.401 --> 03:33:47.842]  It's so apropos.
[03:33:48.963 --> 03:33:50.684]  Why this show is so critical and why
[03:33:51.960 --> 03:33:55.739]  Because I'll tell you one thing, you know, when Trump was running, he said,
[03:33:56.636 --> 03:33:57.716]  I'm going to do a couple of things here.
[03:33:58.316 --> 03:34:02.418]  One, I'm going to talk about... I'm interested in Obama's birth certificate.
[03:34:02.458 --> 03:34:03.758]  I thought, wow!
[03:34:04.498 --> 03:34:05.218]  Oh my God!
[03:34:05.638 --> 03:34:10.340]  And I had no reason necessarily to believe one way or the other, but I love this guy!
[03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:12.880]  He's actually daring to touch the third rail?
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:14.161]  Oh my God.
[03:34:14.561 --> 03:34:15.221]  Oh, wheezy.
[03:34:15.641 --> 03:34:17.962]  Oh, I'm coming to you, honey.
[03:34:17.982 --> 03:34:19.982]  You know, I'm having a French stand for a moment.
[03:34:20.022 --> 03:34:21.102]  What are you kidding me?
[03:34:21.483 --> 03:34:22.943]  He's actually going to talk about that?
[03:34:23.635 --> 03:34:25.736]  The birth certificate?
[03:34:25.876 --> 03:34:27.317]  We don't talk about that!
[03:34:28.058 --> 03:34:31.220]  I want to talk about it because I'm wacky that way.
[03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:34.442]  If you tell me I can't do something, guess what I want to do?
[03:34:34.902 --> 03:34:36.703]  Teddy said I'm going to get the vaccines.
[03:34:37.183 --> 03:34:38.224]  Vaccines!
[03:34:38.484 --> 03:34:39.745]  Oh my God!
[03:34:39.825 --> 03:34:40.465]  You kidding?
[03:34:40.785 --> 03:34:42.807]  I'm even going to pick Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[03:34:42.827 --> 03:34:43.387]  Remember that?
[03:34:43.707 --> 03:34:44.728]  Whatever happened to that one?
[03:34:44.828 --> 03:34:46.589]  Anyway, I thought this is great.
[03:34:47.189 --> 03:34:47.589]  Why?
[03:34:48.029 --> 03:34:49.970]  Because I have something about vaccines?
[03:34:50.250 --> 03:34:52.711]  Because I have something about birth certificates?
[03:34:52.731 --> 03:34:53.071]  Do I know?
[03:34:53.331 --> 03:34:53.571]  No!
[03:34:53.931 --> 03:35:00.072]  Because I want to talk about things that people tell me I can't talk about.
[03:35:00.973 --> 03:35:07.014]  Because as soon as you tell me that, as soon as parents say, when you remember when you were a kid, they say, none of your business.
[03:35:07.034 --> 03:35:07.754]  Don't worry about that.
[03:35:07.795 --> 03:35:08.275]  You're a kid.
[03:35:08.355 --> 03:35:09.335]  That's what I want to talk about.
[03:35:09.475 --> 03:35:09.735]  Why?
[03:35:09.895 --> 03:35:10.475]  Because.
[03:35:10.835 --> 03:35:11.796]  Because I'm your parent.
[03:35:11.876 --> 03:35:12.516]  That's the end.
[03:35:12.576 --> 03:35:13.336]  That's what I want to do.
[03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:15.610]  So I was telling you this.
[03:35:15.911 --> 03:35:17.671]  So after 9-11, I was on the air.
[03:35:17.691 --> 03:35:18.892]  They kept talking about this Flight 93.
[03:35:19.012 --> 03:35:21.673]  And I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.
[03:35:21.693 --> 03:35:22.913]  I'm on Google Images.
[03:35:22.933 --> 03:35:24.154]  I'm thinking, where the hell is Flight 93?
[03:35:24.914 --> 03:35:25.454]  Where is it?
[03:35:25.935 --> 03:35:27.475]  I keep seeing this hole in the ground.
[03:35:27.615 --> 03:35:28.235]  I didn't know.
[03:35:28.736 --> 03:35:29.556]  I didn't know.
[03:35:30.116 --> 03:35:31.297]  I see this hole in the ground.
[03:35:32.357 --> 03:35:32.817]  What is this?
[03:35:32.877 --> 03:35:34.158]  Anybody see Flight 93?
[03:35:34.438 --> 03:35:35.018]  Yeah.
[03:35:35.318 --> 03:35:35.979]  I keep seeing this.
[03:35:36.359 --> 03:35:37.699]  I thought it was a barbecue or something.
[03:35:37.719 --> 03:35:41.201]  It's just fire trucks, and there's this dimpled divot with steam.
[03:35:41.221 --> 03:35:42.161]  I don't know what the hell this is.
[03:35:42.481 --> 03:35:44.322]  I'm looking for a plane crash.
[03:35:45.712 --> 03:35:47.612]  And somebody with me said, no, no, that's it.
[03:35:47.632 --> 03:35:49.573]  I said, what do you mean, that's it?
[03:35:50.273 --> 03:35:51.073]  That's what I saw.
[03:35:51.113 --> 03:35:52.613]  I said, where the hell's the plane?
[03:35:53.193 --> 03:35:54.354]  Where's the plane?
[03:35:54.594 --> 03:35:55.674]  I'm just asking.
[03:35:56.434 --> 03:35:57.694]  And I got these calls.
[03:35:57.714 --> 03:35:59.355]  People said, what are you getting at?
[03:35:59.375 --> 03:36:01.035]  I said, what do you mean, what am I getting at?
[03:36:01.055 --> 03:36:02.635]  I'm asking, where's the plane?
[03:36:03.795 --> 03:36:05.876]  Oh, oh, you're one of them, huh?
[03:36:06.216 --> 03:36:06.696]  Who?
[03:36:07.496 --> 03:36:08.116]  One of those.
[03:36:08.516 --> 03:36:09.777]  Who were you talking about?
[03:36:10.217 --> 03:36:11.737]  The conspiracy people.
[03:36:12.415 --> 03:36:12.895]  The who?
[03:36:13.576 --> 03:36:15.577]  You're a conspiracy theorist!
[03:36:16.497 --> 03:36:19.879]  I'm not even... I'm not saying there's a conspiracy.
[03:36:20.019 --> 03:36:23.180]  It takes two people confederating together, agreeing to do something.
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:24.681]  I don't even know.
[03:36:24.861 --> 03:36:26.402]  I'm asking where's a plane?
[03:36:26.682 --> 03:36:30.524]  How did I get from where's the plane to I'm a conspiracy theorist?
[03:36:31.284 --> 03:36:32.325]  And I was off and running.
[03:36:32.705 --> 03:36:36.187]  And I'm walking around here and I said, does anybody know where the plane is?
[03:36:36.467 --> 03:36:38.088]  Don't talk about the plane!
[03:36:38.708 --> 03:36:39.688]  Why can't I talk about it?
[03:36:39.708 --> 03:36:40.929]  Because you can't!
[03:36:41.556 --> 03:36:42.696]  You just accept it!
[03:36:43.097 --> 03:36:44.397]  Just don't talk about it!
[03:36:45.998 --> 03:36:47.398]  I thought, this is nuts!
[03:36:47.898 --> 03:36:49.539]  I have no ulterior motive!
[03:36:49.899 --> 03:36:50.419]  And then... Aha!
[03:36:52.880 --> 03:36:53.280]  Alex!
[03:36:54.260 --> 03:36:55.221]  He understood!
[03:36:55.241 --> 03:36:57.982]  He said, I'm thinking the same thing!
[03:36:58.422 --> 03:37:02.323]  Better yet, I meet a lot of other people who look around and say, you know what?
[03:37:02.923 --> 03:37:07.325]  Not for nothing, as we say in Hell's Kitchen here, but I want to know where the plane is too.
[03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:10.501]  And that was one of my moments.
[03:37:10.561 --> 03:37:14.602]  These things, these things that just say, I'm not alone.
[03:37:16.022 --> 03:37:17.422]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[03:37:18.082 --> 03:37:19.543]  Take the Schneiderman case.
[03:37:20.143 --> 03:37:21.343]  Eric Schneiderman, right?
[03:37:21.623 --> 03:37:22.183]  Big story.
[03:37:22.443 --> 03:37:22.663]  I know.
[03:37:22.683 --> 03:37:23.124]  Look at that.
[03:37:23.284 --> 03:37:23.724]  That's it.
[03:37:24.284 --> 03:37:26.464]  Just this magic disappearing.
[03:37:26.764 --> 03:37:26.985]  OK.
[03:37:27.465 --> 03:37:28.325]  Eric Schneiderman.
[03:37:29.065 --> 03:37:29.945]  Eric Schneiderman.
[03:37:30.185 --> 03:37:31.406]  I'm not trying to be.
[03:37:31.966 --> 03:37:32.786]  This is called the
[03:37:33.945 --> 03:37:35.086]  I'm hitting my machine here.
[03:37:35.366 --> 03:37:51.242]  I'm not trying to be, um, whenever somebody does this, you always have to say something like, well, I'm not saying all cops are bad, or I'm not saying, well, I gotta be, you know, I'm not saying that, you know, that the me too thing is, oh, no, no, I'm not saying, okay, let me get that out of the way.
[03:37:52.170 --> 03:37:53.811]  This guy's a lousy date.
[03:37:53.851 --> 03:37:55.992]  He's a vicious, horrible person.
[03:37:56.032 --> 03:38:01.375]  He's a punk, a thug, a perv, a skeevy degenerate.
[03:38:01.895 --> 03:38:03.516]  And he's hurt people, women.
[03:38:03.896 --> 03:38:05.617]  And he should go to jail if necessary.
[03:38:05.737 --> 03:38:09.659]  But that is not systematic sex trafficking.
[03:38:10.619 --> 03:38:15.442]  We're confusing this guy with big stuff.
[03:38:16.622 --> 03:38:17.963]  And let me ask you this question.
[03:38:18.945 --> 03:38:25.150]  How come Ronan Farrow all of a sudden overnight is the, what is he, the Mike Wallace of his generation?
[03:38:25.631 --> 03:38:27.232]  Who keeps giving him this stuff?
[03:38:27.652 --> 03:38:29.374]  Ronan Farrow was walking around.
[03:38:29.394 --> 03:38:32.497]  He was on that horrible show on MSDNC.
[03:38:32.557 --> 03:38:33.257]  Remember that one?
[03:38:33.598 --> 03:38:34.338]  It was horrible!
[03:38:34.959 --> 03:38:44.487]  It was so bad I'd rather lick a belt sander or drink bleach or suck a hospital mop or a bar rag than watch that horrible Ronan Farrow
[03:38:45.177 --> 03:38:48.299]  Oh, and by the way, don't tell me he looks like Frank Sinatra.
[03:38:48.419 --> 03:38:49.380]  I don't want to hear that!
[03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:54.283]  I don't know where you got that from, all you armchair Mendelian geneticists.
[03:38:54.323 --> 03:38:56.245]  Don't tell me he looks like Sinatra.
[03:38:56.825 --> 03:39:01.628]  I don't know where you people got this crazy idea that he looks like Frank Sinatra.
[03:39:01.808 --> 03:39:03.630]  He looks exactly like Woody Allen.
[03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.791]  Exactly.
[03:39:05.071 --> 03:39:06.452]  Don't even... What are you doing?
[03:39:06.632 --> 03:39:07.412]  Don't look at that.
[03:39:07.512 --> 03:39:08.153]  Don't look at him.
[03:39:08.213 --> 03:39:08.933]  Look the other way.
[03:39:09.033 --> 03:39:10.014]  Avert your eyes.
[03:39:10.354 --> 03:39:10.675]  Don't.
[03:39:11.215 --> 03:39:12.516]  Because you can't.
[03:39:13.775 --> 03:39:17.997]  Remember, another rule of two is never trust your instincts if you watch mainstream media.
[03:39:18.257 --> 03:39:22.360]  So all of a sudden, Ronan Farrow comes along and he's got the Harvey Weinstein story.
[03:39:22.980 --> 03:39:24.181]  I mean, he's got him.
[03:39:24.581 --> 03:39:26.262]  I mean, debt to rights.
[03:39:27.743 --> 03:39:29.604]  Did you do that yourself, Ronan?
[03:39:29.784 --> 03:39:31.345]  How did you get all these people?
[03:39:31.845 --> 03:39:33.306]  OK, I'm buying it.
[03:39:33.866 --> 03:39:36.207]  Hey, NBC, I kind of work for you.
[03:39:36.888 --> 03:39:39.349]  Do you want to hear this thing I've done?
[03:39:39.629 --> 03:39:40.209]  No!
[03:39:41.430 --> 03:39:41.670]  What?
[03:39:41.890 --> 03:39:42.611]  No!
[03:39:44.528 --> 03:39:47.289]  No, don't you want this big... Not Harvey Weinstein!
[03:39:47.749 --> 03:39:48.549]  What are you, nuts?
[03:39:48.949 --> 03:39:50.690]  We're MSDNC!
[03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:52.330]  He's Hillary's guy!
[03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:53.191]  No!
[03:39:53.791 --> 03:39:54.491]  Get out of here!
[03:39:55.211 --> 03:39:56.011]  Okay, New Yorker.
[03:39:57.812 --> 03:39:58.932]  Pulitzer Prize?
[03:39:59.873 --> 03:40:01.473]  They're a news organization.
[03:40:02.073 --> 03:40:10.316]  I mean, does anybody realize there's a news... Oh, and by the way, today NBC cleared itself of any wrongdoing involving Matt Lauer.
[03:40:10.476 --> 03:40:11.356]  Did you see that one?
[03:40:12.188 --> 03:40:13.348]  Oh, yeah, you probably missed it.
[03:40:13.549 --> 03:40:14.389]  I know what you're thinking.
[03:40:14.549 --> 03:40:15.029]  Wait a minute.
[03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:16.850]  How can they clear themselves?
[03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.550]  Simple.
[03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:21.011]  You hire a couple of law firms and you pay them to clear you.
[03:40:21.831 --> 03:40:33.635]  And you ask your employees, hey, by the way, we're going to have some of our law, our lawyer, law firms going to ask you some questions and we want you to answer the question.
[03:40:33.775 --> 03:40:38.157]  Oh, your job's not on the line, by the way, but it wants you to answer these questions.
[03:40:38.672 --> 03:40:39.952]  You know about Matt Lauer?
[03:40:40.252 --> 03:40:42.353]  We had no idea about Matt Lauer.
[03:40:43.113 --> 03:40:47.234]  There was a... Meredith Vieira was joking about finding sex toys.
[03:40:47.494 --> 03:40:49.055]  Look, I know it's a family show.
[03:40:49.795 --> 03:40:58.537]  NBC, understand this, NBC didn't know about this when everybody knew about Matt Lauer in the world.
[03:40:59.318 --> 03:41:00.218]  Everybody.
[03:41:00.819 --> 03:41:01.880]  It's ridiculous.
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:03.541]  They had roasts for this guy.
[03:41:03.561 --> 03:41:07.604]  They were laughing about his prowess and his Lothario status.
[03:41:07.985 --> 03:41:09.966]  So these people cleared themselves.
[03:41:10.066 --> 03:41:14.129]  OK, so Ronan Farrow, he's like, he's mister now.
[03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:15.991]  He's I guess NBC doesn't want him.
[03:41:16.011 --> 03:41:17.312]  He says, where else do I go?
[03:41:17.592 --> 03:41:21.015]  And all of a sudden he gets another expose, I guess.
[03:41:21.976 --> 03:41:28.120]  He just, you know, gumshoe, shoe leather, you know, detective journalism.
[03:41:28.481 --> 03:41:30.202]  And he exposes Eric Schneiderman.
[03:41:31.050 --> 03:41:38.735]  Now, Eric Schneiderman, a while back, was responsible for killing the NXIVM investigation.
[03:41:39.275 --> 03:41:40.216]  Why is that?
[03:41:41.036 --> 03:41:41.957]  I don't know.
[03:41:42.437 --> 03:41:43.618]  Isn't that weird?
[03:41:43.638 --> 03:41:45.579]  I think it's strange.
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:50.522]  And we have... And by the way, you notice how euphemisms work?
[03:41:50.582 --> 03:41:51.483]  Let me explain.
[03:41:52.584 --> 03:41:57.967]  When you want something to seem kind of eh, eh, you call it something else.
[03:41:57.987 --> 03:41:59.428]  You use a euphemism.
[03:42:00.228 --> 03:42:06.453]  For example, NXIVM is Wholesale Human Sex Trafficking.
[03:42:08.155 --> 03:42:14.540]  But if you call it a sex cult, it's like the old George Carlin football, baseball.
[03:42:14.981 --> 03:42:20.085]  If you call it a cult, well, cult sounds almost voluntary.
[03:42:20.466 --> 03:42:22.828]  Almost, you know about it.
[03:42:23.188 --> 03:42:26.090]  You kind of agreed to it.
[03:42:26.991 --> 03:42:27.592]  It's a cult.
[03:42:28.718 --> 03:42:29.878]  Found yourself in.
[03:42:30.058 --> 03:42:32.419]  It's a, it's a, it's a cult, you, oops!
[03:42:33.839 --> 03:42:39.761]  When this woman, Allison Mack, starts talking, and she is, oh ho ho!
[03:42:40.541 --> 03:42:42.362]  It all starts tumbling down.
[03:42:43.042 --> 03:42:48.863]  So do you think all our friend there, uh, Mr. uh, Mr. Schneiderman's a limited hangout?
[03:42:49.284 --> 03:42:51.104]  I'll explain more coming up.
[03:43:02.632 --> 03:43:04.935]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:43:04.975 --> 03:43:06.697]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:43:07.137 --> 03:43:09.960]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:22.121]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:22.561 --> 03:43:31.690]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:37.718]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:43:37.939 --> 03:43:43.106]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:43:43.387 --> 03:43:45.350]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:45.650 --> 03:43:47.673]  Bought these, sold out in a month.
[03:43:48.917 --> 03:43:51.740]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:51.940 --> 03:43:53.342]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:53.963 --> 03:43:56.526]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:43:57.287 --> 03:43:59.249]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:59.810 --> 03:44:00.591]  Get yours today.
[03:44:00.911 --> 03:44:02.113]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:44:02.413 --> 03:44:07.619]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowarslife.
[03:44:08.380 --> 03:44:11.681]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:44:12.521 --> 03:44:19.882]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:44:20.562 --> 03:44:27.604]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:44:27.744 --> 03:44:32.905]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:44:33.565 --> 03:44:51.895]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Maca root from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[03:44:52.695 --> 03:44:56.197]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[03:44:56.817 --> 03:45:01.560]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle today.
[03:45:03.641 --> 03:45:08.082]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:08.302 --> 03:45:13.003]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:13.603 --> 03:45:19.444]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:45:19.884 --> 03:45:32.466]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:33.226 --> 03:45:41.934]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[03:45:41.954 --> 03:45:43.836]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:44.156 --> 03:45:45.277]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:45.297 --> 03:45:46.579]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:46.779 --> 03:45:47.960]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:49.640]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:51.761]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:51.781 --> 03:45:53.561]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:53.921 --> 03:45:56.522]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:56.562 --> 03:45:57.422]  This is insane.
[03:45:57.822 --> 03:45:59.462]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:45:59.702 --> 03:46:02.263]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:02.623 --> 03:46:04.223]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:04.263 --> 03:46:06.084]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:06.104 --> 03:46:07.964]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:08.824 --> 03:46:14.746]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:15.006 --> 03:46:16.346]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:17.875 --> 03:46:25.861]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:25.901 --> 03:46:28.283]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:28.323 --> 03:46:29.865]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:33.519 --> 03:46:36.361]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:36.741 --> 03:46:39.343]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:39.363 --> 03:46:44.126]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:44.586 --> 03:46:50.730]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:53.852]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:54.212 --> 03:46:55.513]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:06.318 --> 03:47:10.522]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.394 --> 03:47:27.258]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[03:47:27.839 --> 03:47:31.082]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[03:47:34.415 --> 03:47:35.015]  Alrighty, my friends.
[03:47:35.075 --> 03:47:35.795]  Lionel with you.
[03:47:35.815 --> 03:47:36.536]  Glad to be here.
[03:47:36.696 --> 03:47:37.636]  Honored to be here.
[03:47:37.696 --> 03:47:39.056]  This August.
[03:47:40.217 --> 03:47:44.838]  I keep saying radio because it's like I say album and I don't really mean to.
[03:47:45.138 --> 03:47:46.178]  It's age, I guess.
[03:47:46.959 --> 03:47:47.959]  But I want to finish off.
[03:47:47.979 --> 03:47:50.640]  You know what that thing called limited hangout is, don't you?
[03:47:50.660 --> 03:47:59.002]  It's a great concept because what I'm doing is I'm looking at this Schneiderman case here and I'm thinking to myself, you know, you're making this out to be what it's not.
[03:47:59.522 --> 03:48:00.323]  He's a creep.
[03:48:00.863 --> 03:48:01.543]  He's horrible.
[03:48:02.242 --> 03:48:04.185]  He's hit women, hurt women.
[03:48:04.726 --> 03:48:09.413]  One woman had a, like, almost tinnitus in her ear, and, I mean, this guy's a brute!
[03:48:10.154 --> 03:48:15.102]  But it's not systemic, systematic international sex trafficking!
[03:48:16.383 --> 03:48:19.105]  But they're making it sound like, OK, we got Schneiderman.
[03:48:19.245 --> 03:48:20.726]  OK, folks, nothing to see here.
[03:48:21.086 --> 03:48:21.846]  Let's move on.
[03:48:21.886 --> 03:48:22.827]  It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:48:22.867 --> 03:48:23.427]  Wait a minute.
[03:48:23.467 --> 03:48:23.748]  Hold on.
[03:48:24.028 --> 03:48:25.008]  What about NXIVM?
[03:48:26.209 --> 03:48:27.650]  You mean the antacid?
[03:48:27.770 --> 03:48:28.150]  No.
[03:48:28.771 --> 03:48:30.692]  Upstate New York, Alice and Mac.
[03:48:30.752 --> 03:48:31.573]  What about that?
[03:48:32.013 --> 03:48:33.494]  What about Harvey Weinstein?
[03:48:33.874 --> 03:48:35.435]  Oh, you're going to love this one.
[03:48:36.135 --> 03:48:37.076]  This is the best one.
[03:48:37.722 --> 03:48:38.923]  Harvey Weinstein.
[03:48:38.943 --> 03:48:41.484]  We're looking around here and everybody's asking Cy Vance.
[03:48:41.904 --> 03:48:44.646]  You know Cyrus Vance, Secretary of State under Carter?
[03:48:44.726 --> 03:48:45.486]  This is his son.
[03:48:45.506 --> 03:48:50.309]  They ask Cy Vance, hey, what's happening with the Harvey Weinstein case?
[03:48:51.930 --> 03:48:54.231]  Well, we'll get to it.
[03:48:54.251 --> 03:48:55.711]  What do you mean we'll get to it?
[03:48:56.192 --> 03:48:58.813]  Woman after woman coming forward with this guy.
[03:48:59.253 --> 03:49:00.134]  What's going on?
[03:49:00.774 --> 03:49:02.615]  So all of a sudden they say, well, guess what?
[03:49:03.115 --> 03:49:05.517]  We're going to be impaneling a grand jury.
[03:49:05.697 --> 03:49:06.077]  Great!
[03:49:06.570 --> 03:49:07.690]  We're going to get to the bottom of that!
[03:49:08.210 --> 03:49:09.631]  This sexual predator.
[03:49:09.871 --> 03:49:10.611]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:49:11.111 --> 03:49:12.212]  They're not looking at that.
[03:49:12.712 --> 03:49:15.272]  They're going more of a Capone style.
[03:49:15.893 --> 03:49:21.254]  And I read this the other day in Deadline or one of the entertainment columns.
[03:49:21.974 --> 03:49:22.475]  I said, what?
[03:49:23.195 --> 03:49:23.735]  Capone?
[03:49:23.755 --> 03:49:24.255]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:49:24.275 --> 03:49:26.416]  We're going to go after we're going to go after him.
[03:49:26.456 --> 03:49:30.537]  You know, more of a Capone thing, you know, you know, the financial.
[03:49:30.857 --> 03:49:31.037]  I said,
[03:49:31.661 --> 03:49:32.922]  This sex predator?
[03:49:33.242 --> 03:49:36.545]  This guy who was the tip of the iceberg?
[03:49:37.165 --> 03:49:37.505]  Him?
[03:49:38.066 --> 03:49:40.347]  You're going after him for some kind of financial irregularity?
[03:49:40.568 --> 03:49:40.828]  Yeah!
[03:49:41.108 --> 03:49:44.791]  And he hired Ben Brafman, who probably is the best criminal defense lawyer.
[03:49:45.151 --> 03:49:47.072]  He was responsible for getting DSK.
[03:49:47.673 --> 03:49:49.114]  Remember Dominic Strauss-Kahn?
[03:49:49.174 --> 03:49:49.954]  Remember that guy?
[03:49:50.034 --> 03:49:51.295]  He handled his case and others.
[03:49:51.836 --> 03:49:58.861]  And now he gets Alan Dershowitz, who's Trump's BFF all of a sudden, to get him to handle the
[03:49:59.969 --> 03:50:01.550]  Kind of the search warrant issue.
[03:50:02.350 --> 03:50:06.072]  I thought, you son of a... That's what you're doing?
[03:50:06.853 --> 03:50:10.655]  Now, I'm thinking to myself, this is odd.
[03:50:11.355 --> 03:50:12.876]  It's like, enough with Schneiderman.
[03:50:13.216 --> 03:50:14.197]  He's small potatoes.
[03:50:14.237 --> 03:50:14.737]  He's nothing.
[03:50:14.757 --> 03:50:18.619]  I know you're throwing him out like, oh boy, we got the big, the big tuna here.
[03:50:18.959 --> 03:50:19.400]  Sorry.
[03:50:20.300 --> 03:50:21.301]  What's going on here?
[03:50:22.301 --> 03:50:23.142]  And imagine this.
[03:50:23.782 --> 03:50:28.865]  I'm just saying, imagine a movie or a novel that I wrote.
[03:50:29.517 --> 03:50:33.083]  And in my novel, there's this character named Harvey Weinstein.
[03:50:34.786 --> 03:50:38.392]  And Harvey Weinstein says, I want everybody to understand something.
[03:50:38.773 --> 03:50:40.335]  I better not be going down.
[03:50:41.528 --> 03:50:47.993]  I better not be going down in terms of, you know, being sent up the river, cracking rocks upstate.
[03:50:48.474 --> 03:50:50.095]  Don't you think you're going to lower the boom on me?
[03:50:50.235 --> 03:50:51.456]  Do you know who I am?
[03:50:52.017 --> 03:50:53.358]  Hey, Hillary, remember me?
[03:50:53.378 --> 03:50:55.119]  Hey, Clinton, remember me?
[03:50:55.199 --> 03:50:58.202]  Hey, DNC, I was your boy.
[03:50:58.782 --> 03:51:00.984]  I was the one with all the fundraisers.
[03:51:01.324 --> 03:51:02.965]  I was the one who put out the message.
[03:51:03.266 --> 03:51:06.308]  Anytime you needed money from me, I took care of you.
[03:51:06.808 --> 03:51:08.270]  I was a part of the deep state.
[03:51:08.690 --> 03:51:09.691]  I was a part of it.
[03:51:10.331 --> 03:51:10.851]  Oh, me?
[03:51:10.871 --> 03:51:12.032]  The news?
[03:51:12.352 --> 03:51:16.894]  We were under the rubric, under the umbrella of the entertainment arm of this.
[03:51:17.174 --> 03:51:28.520]  I know I'm just bastardizing the great Frank Zappa's line, but he said something to the effect that entertainment or Hollywood is the entertainment branch of the Pentagon.
[03:51:29.494 --> 03:51:32.136]  And all of a sudden, you're going after me?
[03:51:32.176 --> 03:51:33.477]  You knew all about me!
[03:51:34.018 --> 03:51:35.179]  And what about you, Bill?
[03:51:35.619 --> 03:51:36.380]  What have you done?
[03:51:36.780 --> 03:51:39.603]  They're lowering the boom on Schneiderman?
[03:51:39.903 --> 03:51:41.905]  Look at what Bill Clinton was accused of doing!
[03:51:42.125 --> 03:51:43.446]  Does any of this make any sense?
[03:51:43.586 --> 03:51:44.547]  Oh, wait a minute, hold on.
[03:51:44.707 --> 03:51:46.268]  I guess I'm a conservative.
[03:51:46.729 --> 03:51:50.192]  I guess I'm a conservative because I'm asking questions.
[03:51:51.072 --> 03:51:55.136]  So Harvey Weinstein is... I'm just saying, in my novel,
[03:51:56.036 --> 03:52:04.462]  In my character, Harvey Weinstein would be saying, don't you even think of this, because I know a lot of stuff.
[03:52:05.162 --> 03:52:12.187]  So if I've got to, you know, get caught, if I've got to go down, then you better hit me with something that I can deal with.
[03:52:12.508 --> 03:52:13.468]  But not this.
[03:52:14.109 --> 03:52:19.893]  Lo and behold, now there's some financial thing, because what he knows
[03:52:21.212 --> 03:52:22.113]  In Hollywood?
[03:52:22.614 --> 03:52:23.835]  Look at Corey Feldman.
[03:52:23.895 --> 03:52:24.916]  Remember Corey Feldman?
[03:52:25.076 --> 03:52:26.177]  Oh, Corey's a nut!
[03:52:26.898 --> 03:52:30.141]  See, whenever we don't like you, or we don't like what you're saying, you're crazy.
[03:52:30.762 --> 03:52:31.643]  Pedophilia?
[03:52:32.223 --> 03:52:32.964]  Hollywood?
[03:52:33.304 --> 03:52:34.486]  Hollyweird?
[03:52:34.766 --> 03:52:35.687]  Pedawood?
[03:52:36.448 --> 03:52:40.031]  Oh my god, it's unbelievable!
[03:52:40.352 --> 03:52:41.653]  And let me tell you something also.
[03:52:42.874 --> 03:52:44.536]  Something which nobody ever thinks about.
[03:52:45.461 --> 03:53:00.732]  The great people out there, you could call them the Anons or the Crowdsourcers, you've got people who are able to look now at all kinds of people and notice whether that unique little mark, that unique little brand, whether it appears elsewhere.
[03:53:01.272 --> 03:53:06.256]  So you have this, I call it guerrilla grand juries, people who are
[03:53:07.921 --> 03:53:09.002]  Like yours truly.
[03:53:09.162 --> 03:53:11.425]  Like Mr. Jones and his incredible team.
[03:53:11.825 --> 03:53:17.270]  Individuals who are saying to law enforcement agencies, you know what, thanks a lot, but we don't trust you.
[03:53:17.651 --> 03:53:18.271]  We'll do it.
[03:53:18.992 --> 03:53:20.153]  Citizen journalism.
[03:53:20.213 --> 03:53:21.815]  Vigilante journalism.
[03:53:22.416 --> 03:53:24.017]  Civilian journalism.
[03:53:24.498 --> 03:53:25.719]  We'll get to the bottom of this.
[03:53:26.650 --> 03:53:34.914]  And if that Eric Schneiderman is not a limited hangout, if he is not the sacrificial lamb to kind of throw you off the scent, like the rodeo clown.
[03:53:34.934 --> 03:53:36.194]  Remember what a rodeo clown does?
[03:53:36.494 --> 03:53:40.216]  Charging bulls coming this way, he gets in the way and says, hey, over here!
[03:53:41.137 --> 03:53:42.217]  Stormy Daniels.
[03:53:43.318 --> 03:53:44.318]  Stormy Daniels.
[03:53:44.918 --> 03:53:47.259]  You know, I remember years ago, there was Cool Hand Luke.
[03:53:47.700 --> 03:53:51.081]  Remember the scene where he escapes, the dogs are after him.
[03:53:51.361 --> 03:53:52.282]  You know, Paul Newman.
[03:53:52.642 --> 03:53:55.023]  And it was either Cool Hand Luke or another one, I forget.
[03:53:55.819 --> 03:54:04.666]  The guy who was out, the escapee, went into a livestock pen and took manure and rubbed it all over him so that the dogs would lose his scent.
[03:54:04.686 --> 03:54:06.047]  I'm thinking, what a way to go.
[03:54:06.708 --> 03:54:09.590]  Stormy Daniels is that manure we keep rubbing on ourselves.
[03:54:09.790 --> 03:54:10.791]  It throws us off.
[03:54:11.371 --> 03:54:13.953]  Chris Cuomo and those people are throwing you off the scent.
[03:54:14.614 --> 03:54:16.415]  And we're saying, wait a minute, hold on, no, no, no, no.
[03:54:16.835 --> 03:54:17.556]  We're adults.
[03:54:18.096 --> 03:54:21.399]  I want to go back to that Schneiderman case, because let me tell you something.
[03:54:22.270 --> 03:54:38.566]  At the tip, at the top, at the very point of the prism of the biggest story that will bring everything down for reasons that we will never understand because we're not sexual predators.
[03:54:39.617 --> 03:54:57.486]  Wholesale, institutional, systemic, systematic, systematized, organized, sexual trafficking, abuse of children in levels and areas that I guess they figured we've got nothing to worry about.
[03:54:58.146 --> 03:54:59.046]  We've got nothing to worry about.
[03:54:59.086 --> 03:55:06.350]  So what they're doing is they're doing everything in their power to keep this suppressed, to divert your attention.
[03:55:07.339 --> 03:55:28.467]  And can you remember any time, I read an article, it was February or so, from the right after Harvey Weinstein, 71, remember the number, 71 leaders of industry, CEOs, Hollywood type entertainment had to either quit or were fired or facing criminal charges.
[03:55:28.847 --> 03:55:32.368]  We're talking about an infection, a metastatic
[03:55:33.962 --> 03:55:40.627]  Tumor, a cancer with angiogenesis that builds new vascularity, new bloodlines.
[03:55:41.067 --> 03:55:51.756]  It's this tumor, this fetid, rank, horrible, sexual predation tumor from the Catholic Church, to institutions, to music, to whatever it is.
[03:55:52.336 --> 03:55:59.862]  And anywhere you go, where you scratch, where you pull somebody, you run the risk of exposing the lot of it.
[03:56:00.242 --> 03:56:02.724]  And that's what we're looking at right now.
[03:56:03.587 --> 03:56:06.048]  And what they're doing is they're throwing some sacrificial lamb.
[03:56:06.228 --> 03:56:07.789]  They're going to sacrifice Schneiderman.
[03:56:07.969 --> 03:56:10.091]  They're going to make him think like, OK, we got him.
[03:56:10.351 --> 03:56:11.211]  Nothing to see here.
[03:56:11.231 --> 03:56:13.752]  It's like when Al Capone used to turn himself in.
[03:56:13.833 --> 03:56:14.853]  OK, you got me.
[03:56:15.173 --> 03:56:16.154]  There's no crime here.
[03:56:16.574 --> 03:56:17.134]  I'm leaving.
[03:56:17.615 --> 03:56:18.575]  We're not done with this.
[03:56:19.335 --> 03:56:20.136]  Let me tell you something.
[03:56:20.436 --> 03:56:21.337]  This is usual.
[03:56:21.377 --> 03:56:22.917]  Watch what they do to women.
[03:56:22.977 --> 03:56:24.198]  The real me tours.
[03:56:24.558 --> 03:56:25.859]  They marginalize them.
[03:56:26.488 --> 03:56:34.974]  You should see what women will say over the years who were told, we will ruin your career, we will do everything in our power, you don't touch us!
[03:56:35.975 --> 03:56:42.780]  And you can call it Illuminati, whatever it is, I don't know and I'm not here to diagnose historically why people do this.
[03:56:43.601 --> 03:56:49.205]  But everything that you've heard, everything that you've heard about how horrible it is, it's worse.
[03:56:49.465 --> 03:56:51.507]  And let me also tell you something, be very careful.
[03:56:52.116 --> 03:56:54.477]  There is a big difference between suspicion and proof.
[03:56:54.937 --> 03:56:57.138]  Know when to be the cop, and know when to be the jury.
[03:56:57.438 --> 03:57:00.360]  Know the difference between probable cause and reasonable doubt.
[03:57:00.780 --> 03:57:02.440]  Because a lot of people jump the gun.
[03:57:02.741 --> 03:57:12.245]  They jump the gun, they get excited, they've never been involved in any kind of prosecution, they think any time there's any evidence of something, they go berserk, okay?
[03:57:12.785 --> 03:57:13.685]  Be careful.
[03:57:14.005 --> 03:57:15.206]  Be scrupulous.
[03:57:15.826 --> 03:57:16.367]  Focus.
[03:57:16.787 --> 03:57:32.776]  Just because somebody's acting weird, just because somebody's posting something strange, just because somebody may have a design on that you may think is reminiscent of something, does not mean they're part of some wholesale pedophilery.
[03:57:33.237 --> 03:57:36.899]  All right, that being said, thank you so very much, Alex Jones.
[03:57:36.999 --> 03:57:39.761]  Thank you for allowing me to share this moment with you.

[03:58:31.913 --> 03:58:37.075]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
