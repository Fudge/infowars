[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.943]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:31.448]  You know, it's days like these when the plate isn't just full, it's so overwhelming that I feel like I'm letting everybody down.
[00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:41.252]  And then I get overheated, and I get really, really hyper, and my brain speeds up, and I get gassed on, and I have great things to say, and I interrupt them.
[00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:50.310]  Because, that's why I always thank you for putting up with me, because it's just, it makes my brain explode.
[00:00:50.310 --> 00:01:00.955]  Every article, because my brain makes connections in memory to a larger picture, and I'm basically like Robbie the Robot with smoke coming out of my ears.
[00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:05.997]  So thanks for putting up with me when I say that, because just one of these articles has
[00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:28.600]  Hundreds of data points with it that give me chills up my back and then I'm sitting here at home and last night and this morning and in the office looking at all this and just every story and the way the mainstream media responds to it and tries to lie is crazy.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.883]  You know we tell you that we're next year's news today.
[00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:34.483]  Roger Stone has been saying since
[00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:54.303]  January of 2017, one year ago, he has been saying that the key to bringing Obama, Hillary, and all of them to justice is the illegal FISA warrant, which they then lied and said they didn't have.
[00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:58.206]  First they said they were surveilling, then they said they weren't.
[00:01:58.206 --> 00:01:59.787]  Then they said we were crazy and made it up.
[00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:04.731]  Remember all the CNN clips?
[00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:05.792]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.638]  And I kept saying, this is the key to everything.
[00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:28.211]  I agreed with Roger that the fact that they were spying illegally on the campaign, and then were doing it when he was president-elect, and then the day he gets elected, it's the front page of the New York Times that they were spying on Trump Tower, and then they lie about it to Congress and say it's preposterous.
[00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:32.214]  Clapper, Brennan, Comey, in front of Congress.
[00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:33.075]  We have all the clips.
[00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.697]  We're going to play them today.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.784]  Now, Congress has the classified FISA warrant directed by the President.
[00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:49.847]  It wasn't just Comey that went with the fake fuse and GPS.
[00:02:49.847 --> 00:03:07.879]  The President of the United States directed that the frontrunner and the Republican nominee be spied on for espionage with no proof, with a fake dossier, and then lied about it to Congress.
[00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:12.898]  And lied about it to the American people.
[00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:15.639]  And now it's all blown up in their face.
[00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.399]  And they just hope like Gruber.
[00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.300]  Why do I harp on Gruber so much?
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.241]  The top strategist to get Obamacare passed.
[00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:29.103]  And he said, I was hired to deceive people that this was going to triple prices on average within five years.
[00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:32.524]  And I was hired because I'm the best at lying.
[00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.705]  And thank God the public has no memory.
[00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:36.905]  These are quotes.
[00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:38.366]  They don't want you to have a memory.
[00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:47.007]  And here, right here now, we have Congress, we have Senators, we have the FBI coming out.
[00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.690]  It's all right here.
[00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.256]  Congress' confident bombshell FISA abuse memo will be released soon, resulting in major criminal indictment of major officials.
[00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:00.993]  I believe there are people who will go to jail over the Intel Memo.
[00:04:00.993 --> 00:04:06.734]  Worse than Watergate, shocking House Intel Memo reveals FISA abuse by senior DOJ and FBI.
[00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:09.634]  And notice, Trump had this from the time he got into office.
[00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:11.535]  He doesn't release secret stuff, though.
[00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:15.876]  He's waiting for it to be released through proper channels.
[00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:22.697]  Law enforcement was so upset, they leaked to us a previous mass surveillance program
[00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:32.886]  Of Trump, all his residences, and my residence, and my private office!
[00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:34.248]  We broke that last year.
[00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:36.010]  So, yeah, next year's news today...
[00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:38.976]  And then it goes on and on and on.
[00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:42.318]  And then we have the Roger Stone articles from back in March of last year.
[00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:45.540]  Trump wiretapping a scandal bigger than Watergate.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.563]  Roger Stone go after the fraud of the FISA warrant.
[00:04:49.563 --> 00:04:51.164]  Again, that's how smart Roger is.
[00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:55.266]  The more and more I realize that guy is scary how dead on he is.
[00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:56.567]  We've got even bigger news too.
[00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:57.188]  Just stay with us.
[00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:00.425]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:10.567]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:19.089]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:27.851]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:49.546]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:52.227]  It is amazing!
[00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:57.189]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.462]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:19.445]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:20.226]  Or you're mine.
[00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:34.537]  It's Friday, the 19th day of January, 2018.
[00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:38.141]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:45.167]  Sean Hennedy last night said that the Russia investigation is over and is officially blown up in their face.
[00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:48.930]  I agree that it's a double head tap.
[00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.813]  What we just saw, the first unstoppable salvo
[00:06:53.103 --> 00:07:17.050]  Was all the Fusion GPS coming out with the husbands and wives in the Justice Department and FBI, a very close-knit group of less than 30 people at the top, the Deputy Director of the FBI, the head of the Russia operations, or inside of the Justice Department, all connected by the way to the Communist Chinese, smoke-screening and blaming Russia for their operations.
[00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.511]  They went in, created the fake dossier,
[00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:28.374]  Used it to get the fake FISA warrant, and now we know Obama directed the warrant.
[00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:31.596]  Unprecedented, beyond Nixonian.
[00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:37.780]  Congress has the memo, it's classified, but they are trying to look at how they're going to release it.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.421]  Notice Trump knew all this day one.
[00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:41.142]  He got elected, he got briefings.
[00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:44.845]  Once he was president, that's why they were so scared on the 20th, he could see it all.
[00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:51.767]  And that's why when he said, I think it's going to come out Obama was spying on me.
[00:07:51.767 --> 00:07:53.627]  And they said, you're insane.
[00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:55.688]  Comey said it was insane.
[00:07:55.688 --> 00:08:00.010]  We're going to get those clips in front of Congress two weeks later.
[00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:02.755]  What was that?
[00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:14.063]  Early February, he said the President, he pulled the headline, Comey, it's insane to say that Obama ordered spying or knew about spying on Trump.
[00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:17.986]  The spying didn't exist, he said, and Obama wasn't involved.
[00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:21.669]  It was insane!
[00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:22.529]  There it is.
[00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.891]  Comey called Trump crazy.
[00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:26.832]  He was both crazy and insane.
[00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:28.694]  After Obama wiretapping claims report.
[00:08:28.694 --> 00:08:29.134]  There it is.
[00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.235]  Video from the Hill.
[00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:33.172]  When did I tell you?
[00:08:33.172 --> 00:08:35.313]  I told you, let's see if my memory has precision.
[00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:42.215]  I told you February, but I guess he testified again in the fifth month last year, but he also did it in February.
[00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:43.296]  So there you go.
[00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:44.616]  Multiple testimonies.
[00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:49.918]  So, crazy, insane, hearing after hearing after hearing after hearing.
[00:08:49.918 --> 00:08:52.239]  And contradicting himself, hearing over hearing.
[00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:55.119]  There was no secret memos.
[00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:56.380]  He didn't leak to the press.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.841]  There was a secret memo.
[00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.262]  He did leak to the press.
[00:08:59.262 --> 00:09:01.264]  Perjury, perjury, perjury, perjury.
[00:09:01.264 --> 00:09:05.087]  As bad as Brennan's saying, the NSA has never spied on any U.S.
[00:09:05.087 --> 00:09:06.188]  citizen, period.
[00:09:06.188 --> 00:09:07.589]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.172]  It's like saying New York City doesn't exist.
[00:09:11.172 --> 00:09:12.633]  Dallas, Texas doesn't exist.
[00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:15.876]  Your mama didn't exist.
[00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:17.617]  Bananas aren't yellow.
[00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:19.319]  Bears aren't brown.
[00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:20.340]  The sky isn't blue.
[00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.922]  There it is, yeah, in March.
[00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:25.984]  Trump's baseless wiretap claim.
[00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:30.988]  Remember the hysteria in January, February, March, and April?
[00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:34.571]  And CNN clip, Alex Jones is the one.
[00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:45.681]  He's the insane person that says the president was being wiretapped and the White House is using InfoWars as a source.
[00:09:54.514 --> 00:09:57.095]  The White House wasn't using us as a source.
[00:09:57.095 --> 00:10:02.336]  Obama was the source when he was president-elect, when Trump was president-elect.
[00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:08.218]  They were in the news saying, we spied on Trump and have total proof he's a Russian.
[00:10:08.218 --> 00:10:12.299]  So Trump goes, well, it's illegal to leak that if you have it, but I know that isn't true.
[00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:19.400]  So you're lying also about fake leaked intelligence, which is doubly criminal.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.401]  And now we know it was worse than we thought.
[00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:30.084]  Because they're dumb enough to even say in memos, we gotta set the president-elect up, we gotta stop him.
[00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:35.186]  Because that's in the new FISA they got when Obama was outgoing.
[00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:43.610]  Then there's previous FISA and previous surveillance that wasn't even authorized going on during the campaign, obviously.
[00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.851]  This is unbelievable.
[00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.253]  New York Times needs to come clean on wiretap headline.
[00:10:52.728 --> 00:11:16.327]  Yeah, that was September of last year, pointing out that on January 20th, one year ago, tomorrow, that they said they were wiretapping the president, but then again, CNN said that I literally made it up, and that there was no report saying it, even though there were thousands.
[00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:18.369]  So see, my crime is a memory.
[00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:30.025]  Gruber said we can screw these people over and triple their rates and rob them, thank God they're so stupid, and thank God they have no memories.
[00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:32.567]  A memory is everything.
[00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:37.370]  If you're good-natured, love God, have a good memory, and are hard-working, the universe is yours.
[00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.834]  And they all bet on you not having a memory.
[00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:43.375]  And so now,
[00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:49.617]  We have congressional investigations, we have congressmen and women that have seen the memos.
[00:11:49.617 --> 00:11:53.418]  They say the venom is vicious.
[00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:58.559]  And that it's Obama directing the whole operation.
[00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:00.940]  Well of course, he's the president.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.081]  You don't think they're going to carry out stuff this criminal if it wasn't a direct order.
[00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:15.034]  For months and months and months, every day of every week last year, they said that Trump was in shame in congressional testimony.
[00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.856]  Crazy!
[00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:18.277]  Mueller said he was crazy!
[00:12:18.277 --> 00:12:20.158]  Comey said he was crazy!
[00:12:20.158 --> 00:12:22.420]  Everybody said he was crazy!
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:28.644]  And now... It's all imploding.
[00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:34.868]  Comey called Trump crazy and outside the realm of normal, while the president thought there was something wrong with his FBI director.
[00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:36.810]  Their toxic relationship revealed.
[00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:43.593]  And now everything Trump said confirmed in royal flush yet again.
[00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:48.976]  Congressman confident bombshell FISA abuse memo will be released soon.
[00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:52.358]  Will result in criminal charges of top officials.
[00:12:52.358 --> 00:12:56.220]  I believe people are going to go to jail.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.201]  Worse than Watergate.
[00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:01.583]  We're going to play these clips coming up in the next segment.
[00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:06.126]  But we need to have the big headline on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:13:08.268 --> 00:13:11.132]  Because it seems like nobody else is doing this.
[00:13:11.132 --> 00:13:12.293]  We've got to do it yet again.
[00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:13.214]  I'm not complaining.
[00:13:13.214 --> 00:13:17.119]  I just don't get how people don't see the forest for the trees here.
[00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:23.548]  The headline, Trump 100% vindicated in saying he was illegally spied on.
[00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:41.687]  Because they illegally went and lied with fake dossiers knowingly in meetings, saying it's an insurance policy to then go get a warrant to authorize with parallel construction what they were already doing for over a year and a half illegally.
[00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.647]  And all that's coming out.
[00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:52.017]  So we need to go and show screenshots of the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN just like I just did on TV.
[00:13:52.017 --> 00:14:00.800]  If you're a radio listener, they're putting up dozens of articles saying Trump's insane, Trump's crazy, didn't happen, and then it's exactly as he said!
[00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:05.693]  And ram that down their throat, because that's the medicine to the poison.
[00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:11.617]  That's the medicine to the lies of them saying, we're fake news, the president's insane, he's fake, he's dangerous.
[00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.217]  No.
[00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:13.218]  Over and over.
[00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:15.500]  You'll never have a growth rate of 3%.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.720]  Roared past that.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.962]  New York Times Krugman full of prunes.
[00:14:19.962 --> 00:14:21.884]  You just won the Fake News Awards.
[00:14:21.884 --> 00:14:24.085]  Telling America we'd never be great again.
[00:14:24.085 --> 00:14:27.627]  Demoralizing us like Tokyo Rose in World War II.
[00:14:27.627 --> 00:14:28.548]  Unbelievable!
[00:14:31.485 --> 00:14:36.728]  And now all of it proven yet again in your stinking faces.
[00:14:36.728 --> 00:14:38.889]  Take that!
[00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:43.331]  People ask, how can suddenly things one year later be so much better?
[00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:47.733]  Be turning around so quickly because it was artificial suppression.
[00:14:47.733 --> 00:14:50.234]  That's what globalism is.
[00:14:50.234 --> 00:14:56.837]  China has been picked as the industrial base and the place to have prosperity for the elite, not the people.
[00:14:56.837 --> 00:14:58.118]  It's an economic war.
[00:14:58.118 --> 00:14:59.138]  This has been a 21st century war.
[00:15:01.058 --> 00:15:02.359]  And guess what?
[00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:07.624]  Patriots just recaptured the country to a certain extent.
[00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:08.164]  That's all.
[00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:09.245]  We're just Americans.
[00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:10.126]  Trump's an American.
[00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:11.127]  I'm an American.
[00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:13.208]  Rand Paul's an American.
[00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.530]  You're an American.
[00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.311]  You could be Hispanic, black, white, whatever.
[00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.152]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:17.152 --> 00:15:25.159]  If you like America, if you want prosperity, if you want to have freedom, if you want to have a decent life, you believe America's had some really great things about it?
[00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.682]  And you don't want foreign, multinational, secret corporations running your life?
[00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.339]  You're an American.
[00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:33.200]  Let's come in for the big win here, folks.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.561]  We can do it.
[00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:42.704]  We've turned the tide, but I'm telling you, they've created a super PAC called, I am going to assassinate President Donald Trump.
[00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:49.947]  And it was filed in that den of globalist evil, Chicago.
[00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:53.428]  We'll be back with all of this and then even bigger news.
[00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:55.589]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:56.850]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.352]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow.
[00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:02.953]  And like all of you out there, I have problems sleeping.
[00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:10.598]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip-flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache, or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[00:16:10.598 --> 00:16:18.643]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the pad and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:23.146]  MyPillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:27.609]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed, it's about how much of that quality sleep we get.
[00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:30.511]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.
[00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:31.952]  I have a 10-year warranty.
[00:16:31.952 --> 00:16:37.616]  You can wash and dry MyPillow and I give you a 60-day money-back guarantee so you have nothing to lose.
[00:16:37.616 --> 00:16:39.197]  And here's my best offer ever.
[00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:42.079]  You can buy one of MyPillows and get one absolutely free.
[00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:43.200]  Go to MyPillow.com
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.982]  Or call 800-870-0305 and use promo code GCN.
[00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:48.904]  That's MyPillow.com or 800-870-0305 with promo code GCN.
[00:16:57.472 --> 00:17:03.335]  Here's a special message for those of you who owe the IRS at least $10,000 or more in back taxes.
[00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:09.458]  The IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax debt by thousands of dollars.
[00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:13.300]  Call the Federal Tax Management Helpline that has been set up for you.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.762]  800-503-8625.
[00:17:15.762 --> 00:17:19.184]  Stop the wage garnishments, levies, and tax liens now.
[00:17:19.184 --> 00:17:23.586]  Once you've qualified and enrolled, the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you.
[00:17:23.786 --> 00:17:30.013]  These unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden.
[00:17:30.013 --> 00:17:34.819]  The IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs.
[00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:38.743]  You may qualify for substantial savings, so get the help you
[00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:39.103]  We're good.
[00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:08.054]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:16.462]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:21.126]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:28.107]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:35.288]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:42.310]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.790]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.011]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:50.211 --> 00:18:56.553]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:18.878]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:19:18.878 --> 00:19:20.979]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:19:20.979 --> 00:19:24.702]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.183]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:19:26.423 --> 00:19:32.227]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:34.609]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[00:19:42.554 --> 00:19:51.740]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.183]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.154]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:22.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:29.803]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:20:29.803 --> 00:20:35.046]  So, let's go over the anatomy of one of the biggest frauds and one of the biggest fake news stories of 2017.
[00:20:35.046 --> 00:20:36.386]  That was mainstream media establishment.
[00:20:42.045 --> 00:20:47.227]  You know what whole media, telling you that Trump was never wiretapped, period.
[00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:57.892]  Trump Tower was it, no one in his entourage was spied on, despite the fact that they bragged that they'd done it at the end of the campaign and when he was president-elect.
[00:20:57.892 --> 00:21:02.533]  And so here's an article out of Newsweek just last year, December 30th.
[00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:04.434]  Did Obama wiretap Trump?
[00:21:04.434 --> 00:21:06.455]  No.
[00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:09.696]  But it was just one of the right's top conspiracy theories of 2017.
[00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:15.958]  So this is just 20 days ago.
[00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:21.703]  They're still saying this didn't happen when it's all admitted.
[00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:24.145]  Imagine who reads this.
[00:21:24.145 --> 00:21:26.086]  The most gullible people.
[00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:28.949]  Now, if you guys pull that InfoWars article back up, please, I can give them the date.
[00:21:28.949 --> 00:21:30.350]  Thank you.
[00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:36.936]  Here is an Adan Salazar article from March of last year when we were hammering
[00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:42.490]  Then with the truth, so was Drudge Report.
[00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:51.172]  New York Times editor blames InfoWars for Trump wiretap claims after reporting on wiretaps.
[00:21:51.172 --> 00:21:57.054]  And he goes on to say that I made it up.
[00:21:57.054 --> 00:22:01.055]  So what they do is when they want to say something's fake, they just go, oh, that came from Jones.
[00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:08.558]  Because they want to discredit us at the same time, turn us into a symbol of falsehood when we're the symbol of truth.
[00:22:08.558 --> 00:22:09.298]  That's what we attempt to be.
[00:22:10.768 --> 00:22:17.212]  And then, project the lie again, regurgitate the lie onto Trump and the American people.
[00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:30.240]  Knowing full well his paper ran 20 plus articles in January, saying that they'd wiretapped the President, and that we've gone over all those articles just from the New York Times, saying it in January alone.
[00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:36.505]  But as soon as he became the president, he said, that's illegal and it's not true.
[00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:38.646]  And they went, you're insane.
[00:22:38.646 --> 00:22:39.967]  You're crazy.
[00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.608]  Here's the FBI director.
[00:22:41.608 --> 00:22:43.409]  No one ever spied on you.
[00:22:43.409 --> 00:22:46.391]  You're crazy.
[00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:57.559]  Then we think it's the DEA gives us the documents of Trump and myself being spied on for eight years by Obama.
[00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:02.362]  I knew it was real database because it was phone numbers I had in my private office that nobody had.
[00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:14.502]  And it said Alex Jones' private office number, Trump's private office number, Trump's private apartment at Mar-a-Lago number, and I had Trump's number at Mar-a-Lago as private number.
[00:23:14.502 --> 00:23:18.745]  I'm sitting there going, my God, this is real!
[00:23:18.745 --> 00:23:26.392]  And you notice the media didn't touch that when we released screenshots with our numbers blacked out.
[00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:31.951]  Because they knew it was Pulitzer Prize level information.
[00:23:31.951 --> 00:23:37.057]  Oh, Roger Stone convinced Obama administration got FISA warrant to monitor him.
[00:23:37.057 --> 00:23:39.620]  And now that was last year, early last year.
[00:23:41.698 --> 00:23:45.780]  April of last year, all of it proven, and what did Stone say over and over again?
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:57.344]  Next year's news today, he said they got an illegal FISA with illegal B.S., and they're spying on everybody, including you, Alex, and including Trump and his whole family, and they're lying about it, and they've perjured themselves to Congress.
[00:23:57.344 --> 00:23:58.684]  We have them cut and dry.
[00:23:58.684 --> 00:24:02.786]  They will go to jail if Trump moves on this, and every time he talks to the President,
[00:24:04.363 --> 00:24:07.144]  He says, sir, the FISA court was illegal.
[00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:08.844]  They had illegal wiretapping before.
[00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:10.025]  They lied to do it.
[00:24:10.025 --> 00:24:11.025]  You've got to go after them.
[00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:16.087]  You've got them cut and dry, just like they got Nixon for illegal spying.
[00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.387]  Cut and dry!
[00:24:17.387 --> 00:24:19.148]  And now you see it.
[00:24:19.148 --> 00:24:22.829]  That's why they hate us, folks, because we are technical.
[00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:27.030]  We're on the level with what's really going on, talking to the experts.
[00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.211]  That's why they want to shut down.
[00:24:29.178 --> 00:24:41.832]  And I just keep saying that, because it's like, alert, alert, alert, alert, where, you know, the base is being attacked, and I just keep going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just letting you know that this is going on, in between the information we put out.
[00:24:41.832 --> 00:24:43.734]  But we're at a red alert level here.
[00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:48.299]  This is a full-on civil war with hardcore criminals that sold us out to the Communist Chinese.
[00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:50.602]  Obama's a Communist Chinese agent, all of them.
[00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:53.253]  These people are hardcore criminals.
[00:24:53.253 --> 00:24:54.794]  And you suddenly see it in the news.
[00:24:54.794 --> 00:24:57.315]  Chinese communists have taken over every university.
[00:24:57.315 --> 00:24:59.136]  Chinese communists have bought up Hollywood.
[00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:01.138]  Twitter takes the orders of the communist Chinese.
[00:25:01.138 --> 00:25:01.818]  Google.
[00:25:01.818 --> 00:25:08.902]  I mean, they tell them what to censor in America.
[00:25:08.902 --> 00:25:11.964]  All that undercover video is coming out.
[00:25:11.964 --> 00:25:14.766]  So.
[00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.887]  This is from March.
[00:25:15.887 --> 00:25:17.427]  We can put the Infowars article back up.
[00:25:17.427 --> 00:25:18.388]  Great job finding that.
[00:25:18.388 --> 00:25:19.889]  There's a bunch of these videos.
[00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:20.689]  But here is CNN.
[00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:32.977]  Memorializing the fact that they say that I made it up that Trump was being spied on and that I was Trump's source.
[00:25:32.977 --> 00:25:42.101]  Memorializing what lying scum, and by the way Anderson Cooper is leftist foundation CIA and I can tell you right now that that New York Times editor
[00:25:44.788 --> 00:25:45.828]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:45.828 --> 00:25:48.469]  These are the enemies of this country.
[00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:49.330]  Arrogant.
[00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.730]  Conceited.
[00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.651]  Think they're invincible.
[00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:54.171]  Guess what?
[00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.912]  You're just men like everybody else.
[00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:59.473]  In fact, you're traitorous men.
[00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:00.394]  You're globalist.
[00:26:00.394 --> 00:26:01.814]  You were hired because you hate the country.
[00:26:01.814 --> 00:26:05.075]  You were hired because you actually enjoy kicking America while it was down.
[00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:07.136]  Well, guess what, buddy?
[00:26:07.136 --> 00:26:08.056]  Both of you.
[00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:09.217]  We're not down anymore.
[00:26:09.217 --> 00:26:09.617]  We've been
[00:26:10.843 --> 00:26:14.925]  Stomped pretty bad, but we're up and awake now, and we're politically gonna get you back.
[00:26:14.925 --> 00:26:16.766]  You understand that?
[00:26:16.766 --> 00:26:17.927]  You started it!
[00:26:17.927 --> 00:26:19.768]  You're gonna get it now, scum!
[00:26:19.768 --> 00:26:26.972]  Everything you did to my family, everybody else, what you've done to Trump, what you've done to the veterans, what you've done to the old people, all your crap's coming to an end!
[00:26:26.972 --> 00:26:27.892]  You got that?
[00:26:27.892 --> 00:26:37.878]  It doesn't mean some utopia's coming, but we're not out to piss all over the country and break its back so we can teach it a lesson like you globalists are.
[00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:44.674]  Let's go to these two traitors, back in March, memorializing the truth.
[00:26:44.674 --> 00:26:51.822]  Because we have a memory, and we're going to keep hammering them when people start going to prison, and they're never going to stop trying to get the president.
[00:26:51.822 --> 00:26:56.047]  You can't play this game where, oh, it's going to cause a civil war if we send Hillary and all of them to prison.
[00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:58.249]  Mr. President, they're not going to stop.
[00:26:58.249 --> 00:26:59.370]  They already started a civil war.
[00:27:00.071 --> 00:27:01.613]  They've all got to go to prison.
[00:27:01.613 --> 00:27:06.958]  They're saying you're a dictator, we all need to be shut down, take our free speech, and then say you're doing that.
[00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:09.040]  They've already launched their operations.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.243]  Phil Mudd's on TV saying he's going to kill you.
[00:27:12.243 --> 00:27:14.525]  All we can do is go after them now!
[00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:15.806]  Turn the dogs loose!
[00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:16.707]  They started it!
[00:27:16.707 --> 00:27:17.468]  They did it!
[00:27:17.468 --> 00:27:18.749]  They're the foreign power!
[00:27:18.749 --> 00:27:19.650]  They're the enemy!
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.651]  They're the traitors!
[00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:21.692]  Get them!
[00:27:21.692 --> 00:27:22.953]  Get them!
[00:27:22.953 --> 00:27:23.494]  Here's the clip.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:33.242]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on this kind of fringe right-wing media.
[00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.771]  And then there's the New York Times.
[00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:45.578]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:27:45.578 --> 00:27:50.964]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:27:50.964 --> 00:27:57.770]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:11.114]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:11.514]  Nothing!
[00:28:11.514 --> 00:28:13.975]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story!
[00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:21.377]  And it just goes on and on, and now we know, it's in the FISA document, the President directed it himself, of course he did!
[00:28:21.377 --> 00:28:26.679]  I mean, you don't just think we thought that, right?
[00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:27.419]  You don't think
[00:28:28.697 --> 00:28:32.960]  That once he was president-elect, and once he was president, he didn't get all that information.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.783]  And you don't just think, oh, I'm the source for the president?
[00:28:36.783 --> 00:28:38.584]  How about the president's the source?
[00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:45.730]  You people are sick, man!
[00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.072]  Enemies of everything decent.
[00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:53.436]  Just a group of knuckle-dragging thug criminals who thought they could rape this country forever.
[00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:56.418]  We'll be back with the congressional preparation for criminal charges.
[00:28:58.024 --> 00:29:04.788]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.

[00:29:27.847 --> 00:29:32.969]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:38.671]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[00:32:02.822 --> 00:32:10.907]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:16.210]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.732]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:18.732 --> 00:32:22.954]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:22.954 --> 00:32:25.396]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:26.076 --> 00:32:33.319]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:41.382]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:41.382 --> 00:32:48.565]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:48.565 --> 00:32:50.025]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:51.846]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:05.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.426 --> 00:33:37.835]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:41.436]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:44.938]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:33:44.938 --> 00:33:46.719]  In a few minutes, we're going to go to Trump.
[00:33:48.207 --> 00:33:58.451]  Who has just started speaking live at a pro-life demonstration and true women's march ahead of what's coming up with the George Soros financed situations.
[00:33:58.451 --> 00:34:06.553]  We're going to play his remarks and then I'm going to get back into just how huge this is right now.
[00:34:06.553 --> 00:34:10.315]  Just how ultra massive this is right now.
[00:34:11.221 --> 00:34:14.622]  That Congress has now seen the FISA memos.
[00:34:14.622 --> 00:34:16.222]  Obama ordered it illegally.
[00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:17.222]  They lied to get it.
[00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:21.063]  We have their other memos where they admit it's a setup to get the president.
[00:34:21.063 --> 00:34:24.444]  Then we have them perjuring themselves to Congress last year saying they never did it.
[00:34:24.444 --> 00:34:28.045]  That's Comey to Congress.
[00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:31.385]  I mean, this is major perjury.
[00:34:31.385 --> 00:34:39.467]  Not to mention Obama directing spy agencies against candidate, nominee, president-elect.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:46.784]  And then leaving stay-behind networks in government to try to stop the return of the country that's been under globalist control.
[00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:53.209]  We are literally involved in a counter-coup, taking our country back.
[00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:55.030]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.931]  Look at the economy, look at everything.
[00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:09.460]  And then, Bono, and the U2, that's gotten millions and millions of dollars a month, really billions in the aggregate, billions and billions, off of
[00:35:10.456 --> 00:35:39.786]  African aid packages and others and of course he used to give 0.8% under criticism he started giving 1.2% so this is a guy that steals money even bigger than the Clintons from black people but then he has a virtue signaling video with the KKK marching at the White House that calls for opening our borders to everybody so they destroy the third world then flood us I mean it's just again upside down world everything they say it's the opposite
[00:35:41.741 --> 00:35:46.485]  And just look at this monster.
[00:35:46.485 --> 00:35:51.468]  Look at the monsters that are people like Bono that just prey on people.
[00:35:51.468 --> 00:35:52.909]  It's unspeakable.
[00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:54.450]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.673]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and go to the President's ongoing remarks.
[00:35:58.673 --> 00:36:02.276]  They're live right now at the Women's March.
[00:36:02.276 --> 00:36:03.177]  Pence is also there.
[00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:03.497]  Here it is.
[00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:12.910]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.910]  That's so nice.
[00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.891]  Sit, please.
[00:36:15.891 --> 00:36:19.893]  We have tens of thousands of people watching us right down the road.
[00:36:19.893 --> 00:36:20.974]  Tens of thousands.
[00:36:20.974 --> 00:36:24.896]  So I congratulate you, and at least we picked a beautiful day.
[00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:27.197]  You can't get a more beautiful day.
[00:36:27.197 --> 00:36:32.160]  I want to thank our Vice President, Mike Pence, for that wonderful introduction.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.743]  I also want to thank you and Karen for being true champions for life.
[00:36:37.743 --> 00:36:38.864]  Thank you, and thank Karen.
[00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:57.318]  Today, I'm honored and really proud to be the first president to stand with you here at the White House to address the 45th March for Life.
[00:36:57.318 --> 00:36:59.139]  That's very, very special.
[00:36:59.139 --> 00:37:01.541]  45th March for Life.
[00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:04.783]  And this is a truly remarkable group.
[00:37:04.783 --> 00:37:08.425]  Today, tens of thousands of family, students and patriots
[00:37:09.628 --> 00:37:14.930]  And really, just great citizens gather here in our nation's capital.
[00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:28.054]  You come from many backgrounds, many places, but you all come for one beautiful cause, to build a society where life is celebrated, protected, and cherished.
[00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:32.035]  The March for Life is a movement born out of love.
[00:37:32.035 --> 00:37:33.636]  You love your families.
[00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:35.757]  You love your neighbors.
[00:37:35.757 --> 00:37:36.717]  You love our nation.
[00:37:37.626 --> 00:37:48.641]  And you love every child, born and unborn, because you believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.
[00:37:56.187 --> 00:38:00.289]  We know that life is the greatest miracle of all.
[00:38:00.289 --> 00:38:08.394]  We see it in the eyes of every new mother who cradles that wonderful, innocent, and glorious newborn child in her loving arms.
[00:38:08.394 --> 00:38:23.542]  I want to thank every person here today and all across our country who works with such big hearts and tireless devotion to make sure that parents have the care and support they need to choose life.
[00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:34.134]  Because of you, tens of thousands of Americans have been born and reached their full God-given potential.
[00:38:34.134 --> 00:38:36.335]  Because of you.
[00:38:36.335 --> 00:38:40.838]  You're living witnesses of this year's March for Life theme.
[00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:45.481]  And that theme is, Love Saves Lives.
[00:38:53.434 --> 00:39:02.740]  As you all know, Roe vs. Wade has resulted in some of the most permissive abortion laws anywhere in the world.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:14.368]  For example, in the United States, it's one of only seven countries to allow elective late-term abortions, along with China, North Korea, and others.
[00:39:14.368 --> 00:39:17.851]  Right now, in a number of states, the laws allow a baby to be born
[00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:25.457]  From his or her mother's womb in the ninth month.
[00:39:25.457 --> 00:39:27.118]  It is wrong.
[00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:28.138]  It has to change.
[00:39:28.138 --> 00:39:29.238]  This is incredible.
[00:39:29.238 --> 00:39:31.898]  Americans are more and more pro-life.
[00:39:31.898 --> 00:39:34.099]  You see that all the time.
[00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:39.900]  In fact, only 12% of Americans support abortion on demand at any time.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.760]  This is too powerful.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.321]  Under my administration, we will always defend the very first right
[00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:48.523]  In the Declaration of Independence.
[00:39:48.523 --> 00:39:52.307]  And that is the right to life.
[00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:52.987]  Wow.
[00:39:52.987 --> 00:39:56.710]  He's the first sitting president since Roe v. Wade to actually go to one of these events.
[00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.951]  He pledged he would.
[00:39:57.951 --> 00:39:59.293]  He just continues.
[00:39:59.293 --> 00:40:00.694]  And their sacrament is this.
[00:40:00.694 --> 00:40:02.195]  This is the heart of the globalist operation.
[00:40:02.195 --> 00:40:04.938]  It's been exactly one year since I took the oath of office.
[00:40:04.938 --> 00:40:05.478]  This is totally real.
[00:40:05.478 --> 00:40:06.099]  This is the final proof.
[00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:09.041]  And I will say, our country is doing really well.
[00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:11.744]  Our economy is perhaps the best it's ever been.
[00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.192]  You look at the job numbers.
[00:40:14.192 --> 00:40:17.797]  You look at the companies pouring back into our country.
[00:40:17.797 --> 00:40:21.343]  You look at the stock market at an all-time high.
[00:40:21.343 --> 00:40:22.344]  Unemployment, 17-year low.
[00:40:24.412 --> 00:40:32.799]  Unemployment for African American workers at the lowest mark in the history of our country.
[00:40:32.799 --> 00:40:39.364]  Unemployment for Hispanic at a record low in history.
[00:40:39.364 --> 00:40:43.307]  Unemployment for women, think of this, at an 18 year low.
[00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:47.703]  We're really proud of what we're doing.
[00:40:47.703 --> 00:40:59.149]  And during my first week in office, I reinstated a policy first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, the Mexico City Policy.
[00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:14.577]  I strongly supported the House of Representatives' pain-capable bill, which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide.
[00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:23.432]  And I call upon the Senate to pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing.
[00:41:23.432 --> 00:41:25.453]  Yes!
[00:41:25.453 --> 00:41:29.997]  Don't even tell the women, they can just have the baby and get paid by the adoption groups hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:41:29.997 --> 00:41:31.358]  Don't tell the women that.
[00:41:31.358 --> 00:41:33.600]  They just, they harvest the baby.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.903]  I signed an executive order to protect religious liberty.
[00:41:40.287 --> 00:41:42.769]  They've been using the IRS to bully churches, absolutely.
[00:41:42.769 --> 00:41:43.429]  Very proud of that.
[00:41:43.429 --> 00:41:44.690]  He promised me personally he would do that.
[00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:56.297]  I am announcing that we have just issued a new proposal to protect consciences, rights, and religious freedoms of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.
[00:41:56.297 --> 00:41:57.017]  So important.
[00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:03.500]  But it won't be live when we come back, but we're going to play all of it.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.201]  I'm going to preempt stuff if we have to.
[00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:25.669]  He just keeps popping up and keeps delivering every day, winning, winning, winning, and sanctifying life, and glorifying it, and humanizing babies, and humanizing families, and talking about how humans are good, and then that makes people act good, and it makes people have vision, and it makes them believe, and then you see it happen.
[00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:33.439]  We've been under conscious demoralization, just like a foreign military does to its enemy.
[00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:35.481]  And it's stopping!
[00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:42.866]  And the enemies are just, like, completely out of control, frothing at the mouth, not knowing what to do.
[00:42:42.866 --> 00:42:45.188]  You can see it's a spiritual war.
[00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:46.890]  And I'm not judging everybody that's had abortions.
[00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.271]  A lot of people that mean well have them.
[00:42:48.271 --> 00:42:49.512]  I'm not judging you.
[00:42:49.512 --> 00:42:54.716]  I'm saying that people that push it and love it at their level, it is their greatest sacrament.
[00:42:54.716 --> 00:42:56.037]  They don't just like raping babies.
[00:42:57.912 --> 00:43:03.899]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:43:03.899 --> 00:43:08.064]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:43:08.064 --> 00:43:14.311]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:23.240]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.105]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:43:29.105 --> 00:43:41.236]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:43:41.896 --> 00:43:48.201]  Macaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.

[00:44:01.424 --> 00:44:16.030]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:23.573]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:44:24.153 --> 00:44:35.297]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:44:35.297 --> 00:44:41.539]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:43.960]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:51.547]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:44:51.547 --> 00:44:55.650]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:58.556 --> 00:45:03.200]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:10.847]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[00:45:10.847 --> 00:45:14.791]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:21.213]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:45:21.213 --> 00:45:27.814]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:45:27.814 --> 00:45:37.937]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:45:38.177 --> 00:45:44.979]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:45:44.979 --> 00:45:47.860]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver and Iodine.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.461]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:56.462]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:58.363]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:59.103 --> 00:46:04.247]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:46:04.247 --> 00:46:09.031]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:17.718]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:46:17.718 --> 00:46:21.081]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[00:46:21.201 --> 00:46:26.444]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:46:26.444 --> 00:46:33.767]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:46:33.767 --> 00:46:37.669]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:42.391]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:45.973]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:46:46.633 --> 00:46:48.135]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:12.586 --> 00:47:22.114]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:47:22.114 --> 00:47:23.515]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:47:23.515 --> 00:47:28.239]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:35.606]  They take the tissue of the babies and then they grow the tissue in these vats and then they harvest it.
[00:47:36.883 --> 00:47:43.512]  They grind it up into vaccine material, into flavor testing for Pepsi, into thousands of products we know of.
[00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:45.675]  We are literally ingesting our own children.
[00:47:46.914 --> 00:47:54.236]  And it's done not from a position of eugenics, even at the base level, to get rid of poor people as it's pushed, and to make society better.
[00:47:54.236 --> 00:47:55.317]  No, no.
[00:47:55.317 --> 00:47:57.197]  It's done to dehumanize everything.
[00:47:57.197 --> 00:48:02.099]  And Trump, in the times I've talked to him, would say, you know, I know they're targeting churches of the IRS.
[00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:03.879]  We're going to stop that.
[00:48:03.879 --> 00:48:05.540]  And we're going to stop partial birth abortion.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.500]  We're going to go back to the states.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.001]  And that's constitutional.
[00:48:09.001 --> 00:48:10.001]  And we're going to save children.
[00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:11.521]  And I'd say, well, I'm a Christian, sir.
[00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.362]  Yes, I'm really glad that you're saying that.
[00:48:14.002 --> 00:48:18.464]  But I still kind of half-way believe the media that he was this big liberal somehow, and this was rhetoric.
[00:48:18.464 --> 00:48:19.565]  I'm like, sure.
[00:48:19.565 --> 00:48:26.508]  Let's get the tax cuts, stabilize the country, and I'm sure that's going to be great.
[00:48:26.508 --> 00:48:31.391]  But then Trump, three or four times I've talked to him, brings up the energy at churches.
[00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:40.270]  And the people praying, I mean he talks like, especially in black churches, he's like, man you feel the energy in here?
[00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.612]  And he gets high off of it.
[00:48:43.612 --> 00:48:51.337]  And Trump didn't used to pick that up in the elite churches he went to and stuff where it's all just a social gathering.
[00:48:51.337 --> 00:48:54.659]  And Trump likes the average people and he's into energy.
[00:48:55.455 --> 00:48:57.517]  Positive energy.
[00:48:57.517 --> 00:49:00.380]  He's like the opposite of a psychic vampire.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:05.144]  You know, I've only been around Trump a couple times and not even really able to talk to him.
[00:49:05.144 --> 00:49:07.266]  And it's like you feel the energy.
[00:49:07.266 --> 00:49:09.488]  Same thing with his wife with even more energy.
[00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:12.711]  And you're almost like can't hardly walk up to him.
[00:49:12.711 --> 00:49:14.413]  It's not like any Hollywood stars.
[00:49:14.413 --> 00:49:15.494]  I've ever seen any of it.
[00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:17.175]  It's like when they turn it on, man, it's like.
[00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:20.400]  And the globalists know it.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.601]  And he's been a sleeper cell for 50 years.
[00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:24.742]  His dad was a big anti-globalist patriot.
[00:49:24.742 --> 00:49:27.023]  Gave huge amounts of money to the John Birch Society.
[00:49:27.023 --> 00:49:28.684]  He fought Naptangat.
[00:49:28.684 --> 00:49:31.845]  He has been literally preparing for this his whole life.
[00:49:31.845 --> 00:49:35.567]  This is unbelievable.
[00:49:35.567 --> 00:49:41.570]  I mean, this is... I just... Let me tell you, their final thing is abortion.
[00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.091]  It's their whole cult, their whole system.
[00:49:44.091 --> 00:49:47.833]  And when you go after that like he's doing, there's no way
[00:49:48.891 --> 00:49:50.412]  He's with the Illuminati.
[00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:52.573]  There's no way he's with this system.
[00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.714]  There is no way.
[00:49:54.714 --> 00:49:55.534]  No way.
[00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:56.614]  And he'd be doing this.
[00:49:56.614 --> 00:49:57.435]  Zero.
[00:49:57.435 --> 00:49:58.135]  Zero.
[00:49:58.135 --> 00:50:00.456]  And of course, my gut tells me that too.
[00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:02.877]  And the churches, their gut tells them that.
[00:50:02.877 --> 00:50:04.438]  The real churches.
[00:50:04.438 --> 00:50:08.499]  That's why they, oh, he liked hot women when he's, you know, or most of that's made up.
[00:50:08.499 --> 00:50:09.340]  Whatever.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.041]  King David, you know, had his best friend killed so he could have his wife.
[00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:13.642]  He repented of it later.
[00:50:13.642 --> 00:50:14.962]  He did it out of the flesh.
[00:50:14.962 --> 00:50:16.203]  He wasn't inherently evil.
[00:50:17.113 --> 00:50:24.735]  Trump hasn't done one one hundredth what King David, a man after God's own heart, the prototype of Christ did.
[00:50:24.735 --> 00:50:31.217]  But what you judge a man by is the fruits and by the man's enemies, and by his fruits and by his enemies.
[00:50:31.217 --> 00:50:40.280]  You know this man, so many Christians have said, predestined to win, can't be stopped, all this stuff, they feel it in the spirit, and I'm kind of like, come on, let's not be that optimistic.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:40.760]  And now,
[00:50:42.157 --> 00:50:43.658]  I mean, they're going to try to kill him.
[00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:44.619]  We already know that.
[00:50:44.619 --> 00:51:02.570]  They're like demons crawling around their bellies right now, or the pigs running over the edge of the cliff, when Christ tells Legion, not the name of the demon, but we are Legion, out of him, and the demons run into the pigs, and they run off the edge of a cliff.
[00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.832]  That's what these people are doing, the Democrats, the Globalists, all of them, and then they're slaves.
[00:51:10.077 --> 00:51:19.343]  Because they get the left into this elitism that we're the intellectuals, everybody else are country bumpkins, people that believe in God are idiots, blah, blah, blah, and then we're going to run society and we know best.
[00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:21.064]  That's your average liberal means well.
[00:51:21.064 --> 00:51:31.390]  But above them are really dark controllers who know and who are into the occult and into dark energy and into death and into being evil and into being selfish.
[00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:35.512]  And when you pull back and see them, it's sick.
[00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:37.554]  And you just thank God you're not those people.
[00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:39.648]  This is so historic.
[00:51:39.648 --> 00:51:40.890]  I didn't even know this was going to happen.
[00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.513]  There had been rumors of it, and just boom, it pops up.
[00:51:43.513 --> 00:51:46.517]  So I don't even know if he's still speaking, because we weren't playing it live.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.681]  But now we've got to pause from earlier.
[00:51:49.681 --> 00:51:54.705]  I haven't even plugged this hour because I'm just, I can't even plug products in the middle of stuff like this.
[00:51:54.705 --> 00:51:55.806]  Please support the show.
[00:51:55.806 --> 00:51:56.726]  MFullRestore.com.
[00:51:56.726 --> 00:51:57.287]  We won't be here.
[00:51:57.287 --> 00:51:58.367]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:51:58.367 --> 00:51:59.088]  Let's go back.
[00:51:59.088 --> 00:52:01.089]  The President's delivering.
[00:52:01.089 --> 00:52:01.810]  You're delivering.
[00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:02.650]  Here he is.
[00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:14.978]  Today I'm announcing that we have just issued a new proposal to protect consciences, rights, and religious freedoms of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.
[00:52:14.978 --> 00:52:15.719]  So important.
[00:52:16.747 --> 00:52:29.637]  I have also just reversed the previous administration's policy that restricted states' efforts to direct Medicaid funding away from abortion facilities that violate the law.
[00:52:29.637 --> 00:52:32.239]  Exactly what he told me on the phone a year ago.
[00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:33.099]  Boom.
[00:52:33.099 --> 00:52:33.640]  That's it.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.700]  See that?
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:40.705]  We are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society.
[00:52:41.403 --> 00:52:48.345]  But this movement can only succeed with the heart and the soul and the prayer of the people.
[00:52:48.345 --> 00:52:50.166]  A pro-human future.
[00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:57.569]  Here with us today is Mariana Donadio from Greensboro, North Carolina.
[00:52:57.569 --> 00:52:59.649]  Where is Mariana?
[00:52:59.649 --> 00:53:00.049]  Hello.
[00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:02.710]  Come on up here, Mariana.
[00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.311]  Come.
[00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.492]  Nice to see you.
[00:53:06.492 --> 00:53:07.472]  People are the foundation.
[00:53:08.326 --> 00:53:12.750]  Mariana was 17 when she found out she was pregnant.
[00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.873]  At first, she felt like she had no place to turn.
[00:53:15.873 --> 00:53:23.159]  But when she told her parents, they responded with total love, total affection, total support.
[00:53:23.159 --> 00:53:24.620]  Great parents?
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.461]  Great?
[00:53:25.461 --> 00:53:27.083]  I thought you were going to say that.
[00:53:27.083 --> 00:53:29.565]  I had to be careful.
[00:53:29.565 --> 00:53:33.969]  Mariana bravely chose life and soon gave birth to her son.
[00:53:35.023 --> 00:53:38.446]  She named him Benedict, which means blessing.
[00:53:38.446 --> 00:53:42.369]  Mariana was so grateful for her parents' love and support.
[00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:43.710]  Hit pause.
[00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.011]  Thanks.
[00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:45.132]  Did you see Trump just go...
[00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:51.114]  Doing good and good energy, that's the secret to Trump.
[00:53:51.114 --> 00:53:53.116]  He's getting high off of this.
[00:53:53.116 --> 00:53:55.638]  He's getting energy off of doing good.
[00:53:55.638 --> 00:54:00.643]  Not off everybody praising him up there, but off of delivering on what he said he would do.
[00:54:00.643 --> 00:54:11.754]  When he signed the tax cut that knocked out much of Obamacare, he went... When he pushed that thing out, he signed it, he... See, this is what being honorable is about.
[00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:16.281]  It's spiritual.
[00:54:16.281 --> 00:54:18.562]  It's getting closer to God each time you do good.
[00:54:18.562 --> 00:54:21.922]  And maybe 30, 40 years ago, Trump wasn't that close to God.
[00:54:21.922 --> 00:54:23.583]  But he's getting a lot closer.
[00:54:23.583 --> 00:54:26.343]  And this is all of our journeys we're talking about here.
[00:54:26.343 --> 00:54:28.023]  This is just amazing.
[00:54:28.023 --> 00:54:31.504]  And let's go back to the President.
[00:54:31.504 --> 00:54:42.106]  As fortunate as her, she joined with others in her community to start a maternity home to care for homeless women who were pregnant.
[00:54:42.739 --> 00:54:44.040]  That's great.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.163]  They named it Room at the Inn.
[00:54:47.163 --> 00:54:59.115]  Today, Mariana and her husband, Don, are the parents of six beautiful children, and her eldest son, Benedict, and her daughter, Maria, join us here today.
[00:54:59.115 --> 00:55:00.116]  Where are they?
[00:55:00.116 --> 00:55:00.716]  Come on over.
[00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:09.721]  Praising families, praising real wealth, not Hollywood red carpets.
[00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:11.762]  This is the opposite of Satanism.
[00:55:11.762 --> 00:55:21.987]  Over the last 15 years, Room at the Inn has provided housing, childcare, counseling, education, and job training to more than 400 women.
[00:55:21.987 --> 00:55:25.068]  Even more importantly, it has given them hope.
[00:55:25.068 --> 00:55:27.850]  It has shown each woman that she is not forgotten.
[00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:37.492]  That she is not alone, and she really now has a whole family of people who will help her succeed.
[00:55:37.492 --> 00:55:43.293]  That hope is the true gift of this incredible movement that brings us together.
[00:55:43.293 --> 00:55:44.774]  He just said the family's well, see?
[00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:53.855]  It is the gift of friendship, the gift of mentorship, and the gift of encouragement, love, and support.
[00:55:53.855 --> 00:55:56.156]  Those are beautiful words and those are beautiful gifts.
[00:55:57.606 --> 00:56:04.048]  And most importantly of all, it is the gift of life itself.
[00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:16.852]  That is why we march, that is why we pray, and that is why we declare that America's future will be filled with goodness, peace, joy, dignity, and life.
[00:56:17.592 --> 00:56:20.174]  For every child of God.
[00:56:20.174 --> 00:56:20.734]  Hit pause again.
[00:56:20.734 --> 00:56:21.495]  We gotta go to break.
[00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:28.759]  Thank you to the... I told you when I was there a year ago, before I even tweeted out, the New York Times member said, how did you know what he would speak about it?
[00:56:28.759 --> 00:56:29.600]  I didn't.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.040]  I felt it.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.342]  I said he's gonna bring God back into the covenant.
[00:56:33.342 --> 00:56:35.864]  He's gonna declare that people have value again.
[00:56:35.864 --> 00:56:40.767]  He's gonna say that families have value, that the states have value, that the power is the people, and that
[00:56:44.386 --> 00:56:48.227]  Again, we're not gonna be transhumanists, we're not gonna go down this road.
[00:56:48.227 --> 00:56:55.989]  And now he's doing a ritual up there of love's coming into America, decency, honor, life, the family.
[00:56:55.989 --> 00:56:59.631]  He's literally engaged in a ritual.
[00:56:59.631 --> 00:57:02.511]  A Christian ritual.
[00:57:02.511 --> 00:57:05.792]  Saying, we're bringing the light back in.
[00:57:05.792 --> 00:57:09.013]  We're bringing God back in.
[00:57:09.013 --> 00:57:11.034]  Last night I was talking to one of the top writers in the country.
[00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:17.684]  And I was talking about a big project we're working on that's very, very important.
[00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:18.765]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:57:18.765 --> 00:57:25.588]  And it's a simple thing, but it's key.
[00:57:25.588 --> 00:57:29.390]  And it spells it all out right here.
[00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:35.273]  I said, thanks for believing in a human future and fighting for it.
[00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:37.134]  And we go on to talk about that.
[00:57:37.134 --> 00:57:39.155]  We're fighting for a human future.
[00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.098]  Which side are you on?

[00:59:40.126 --> 00:59:40.826]  Immune Wall.

[00:59:51.886 --> 01:00:03.616]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.616 --> 01:00:06.258]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:06.258 --> 01:00:08.920]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.242]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.876 --> 01:00:18.177]  You know, the left puts out a lot of different lies.
[01:00:18.177 --> 01:00:23.679]  They claim the president doesn't mean what he says, he's a liar, he never keeps his promises.
[01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:26.260]  But that lie's kind of receding because it's so ridiculous.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:32.103]  Now they just go, okay, he is keeping all his promises, or trying as hard as he can, and he's insane.
[01:00:32.103 --> 01:00:38.885]  So continuing with the speech that has been live, but we've been pausing it during the breaks, the president at the March for Life.
[01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:43.147]  Other presidents, Reagan would never go, it was seen as too incendiary.
[01:00:45.077 --> 01:00:46.798]  It's kind of in the back halls of things.
[01:00:46.798 --> 01:00:50.180]  Yeah, we don't really want all these black people to have kids, do we?
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.542]  I'm not saying Reagan was like that, but that's kind of the attitude of the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:56.583]  And, oh, you know, too many brown people or whatever.
[01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:58.524]  And that's really what Margaret Sanger and the left's all about.
[01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:07.489]  That's why they want to manage the left so they can make sure they kill as many brown people as possible while using those that live as weapons against the whites to have total control.
[01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:09.610]  And then George Herbert Walker Bush wouldn't do it.
[01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.011]  George W. Bush wouldn't do it.
[01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:13.552]  None of them would ever attend any of these big pro-life events.
[01:01:13.552 --> 01:01:14.453]  Well, guess what he did?
[01:01:16.738 --> 01:01:22.741]  He said, give me a year, maybe two, we'll turn this whole thing around, Alex.
[01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:30.164]  And he's about to go on the attack, starting in 48 hours.
[01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:39.268]  In the first two days he was in office, he signed executive orders getting us out of the TPP, visited the CIA, turned the coal back on, he did hundreds of things in the first two days.
[01:01:39.268 --> 01:01:41.569]  What's he gonna do someday?
[01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:44.130]  Day number one.
[01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:45.811]  First year is salvage.
[01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:52.844]  Next year is savage.
[01:01:52.844 --> 01:02:01.046]  Oh, and the savaging is going to begin, and they're racing to kill him right now.
[01:02:01.046 --> 01:02:12.908]  Let's play a few more minutes of the President, where he was invoking life, humanity having value, we're not trash, we're not ugly, we're not garbage, we're connected to God, we're beautiful creative creatures, and when we believe that, we then can have that.
[01:02:12.908 --> 01:02:15.849]  It's not like Oprah Winfrey's secret that you want a big house or a car, you get it.
[01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:19.402]  It's the secret of, we already have it.
[01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.026]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[01:02:26.647 --> 01:02:30.590]  The President there, as he has just wrapped up his remarks at the March for Life.
[01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:41.858]  Of course, he's speaking from the Rose Garden, and he had next to him a woman named Mariana Donatio, who was his example of someone who bravely chose life when she found out that she was 17 years old and pregnant.
[01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:48.003]  That person now has six children, married, and helps run an organization called Room at the Inn.
[01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:54.868]  The President began his remarks as the first in his position to ever, in all of its years of existence,
[01:02:57.446 --> 01:02:59.768]  It's just reality is so epic.
[01:02:59.768 --> 01:03:03.452]  People overuse the word epic, but this is getting epic.
[01:03:03.452 --> 01:03:05.614]  It's like we had a 107 fever.
[01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:09.658]  We were falling apart a year ago.
[01:03:09.658 --> 01:03:15.324]  And now, we're out mowing the yard.
[01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.205]  Got a nice tan.
[01:03:16.205 --> 01:03:19.809]  There's still a lot of bad things going on in the neighborhood.
[01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:31.179]  But, as a country, we're on the mend, and it's a dramatic, miraculous recovery, and then you look at the nastiness of the Democrats.
[01:03:31.179 --> 01:03:33.281]  The nastiness of the globalists.
[01:03:33.281 --> 01:03:39.386]  The Pope saying, open your borders, and, you know, oh, and attacking Catholics that criticize pedophilia in the Catholic Church.
[01:03:39.386 --> 01:03:44.470]  He came out and said, it's not going on, leave us alone.
[01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:45.111]  Truly evil.
[01:03:48.188 --> 01:03:53.210]  And Justin Trudeau puts pro-lifers on notice that their views won't be tolerated in public.
[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:54.791]  You're not allowed to put it out on the internet.
[01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:55.611]  Not allowed to demonstrate.
[01:03:55.611 --> 01:03:57.512]  You have no rights in Canada.
[01:03:57.512 --> 01:04:00.913]  Man, talk about authoritarianism.
[01:04:00.913 --> 01:04:02.394]  That was what Trudeau said yesterday.
[01:04:02.394 --> 01:04:03.875]  Will you guys print me that?
[01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.115]  Get the video if you can.
[01:04:05.115 --> 01:04:09.257]  Now we've got a blitzkrieg of video coming up.
[01:04:09.257 --> 01:04:13.739]  And just incredible breaking news on so many fronts and what's happened with the FISA.
[01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:27.709]  Warrant and what was filed to get it they say is Exponentially worse than the memos with the deputy director McCabe saying we got to set the president up We can't let him get into office.
[01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:32.653]  We got to have an insurance policy And making stuff up.
[01:04:32.653 --> 01:04:37.577]  I mean this is Obama directing Viciously saying stop him.
[01:04:37.577 --> 01:04:38.418]  They're so arrogant.
[01:04:38.418 --> 01:04:40.179]  They don't even do it the right way.
[01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:42.942]  They were gonna be corrupt They're just like get him set him up
[01:04:44.244 --> 01:04:44.845]  Here's the order!
[01:04:44.845 --> 01:04:47.027]  Like, yes, master!
[01:04:47.027 --> 01:04:48.488]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:04:48.488 --> 01:04:52.792]  And all you Democrats that signed on to this, you don't even get anything out of this.
[01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:54.274]  You're just idiots.
[01:04:54.274 --> 01:04:54.814]  We'll be back.
[01:04:54.814 --> 01:04:55.275]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.051 --> 01:05:09.135]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:05:09.135 --> 01:05:10.516]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:10.516 --> 01:05:13.857]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[01:06:39.136 --> 01:06:40.777]  This is the fight.
[01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:48.260]  This is how, without violence, we carry out violence against the liars, the scum, the control freaks, and their victims.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:58.425]  I think that they're gonna run us over, because I feel sorry for the victims of globalism, but a lot of them are dangerous, brainwashed, bug-eyed, heathen.
[01:06:58.425 --> 01:07:05.488]  And I gotta keep telling them, I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if you wanna fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:07:07.202 --> 01:07:08.902]  And isn't it funny?
[01:07:08.902 --> 01:07:19.505]  As soon as decent people started fighting back across the world, evil started falling just like dominoes.
[01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:30.849]  Evil always seems unstoppable when it's running wild, taking over, until it runs into real resistance.
[01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:32.169]  And then it doesn't ever know what to do.
[01:07:33.459 --> 01:07:36.442]  Because it believes its own delusion.
[01:07:36.442 --> 01:07:38.644]  Like CNN and MSNBC and all of them.
[01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:44.029]  Can we queue up that clip one more time of Anderson Cooper and the New York Times editor?
[01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:57.821]  Saying, I made up the FISA fake warrant, and I made up the wiretapping, and Comey says I'm crazy, and says Trump's crazy, says everybody's crazy that says it.
[01:07:57.821 --> 01:07:59.843]  When it was already on record then,
[01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:09.454]  Just like they thought they'd tell you Obamacare was free, and then once they got it passed, they said, oh, it's as cheap as a cable bill.
[01:08:09.454 --> 01:08:13.536]  Then they said you could keep your doctor, then they said they never said you could keep your doctors.
[01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:18.899]  Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:24.562]  We're putting the articles on screen for TV viewers.
[01:08:24.562 --> 01:08:28.164]  You want me to subject the audience, the radio audience, to Comey's voice?
[01:08:29.346 --> 01:08:34.668]  Let's try to grab that, because he said crazy in one and insane in another.
[01:08:34.668 --> 01:08:38.909]  One was a March hearing, one was like a little bit later than that.
[01:08:38.909 --> 01:08:42.771]  And then I'm going to just run through these clips.
[01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:44.531]  I've got to stop pontificating.
[01:08:44.531 --> 01:08:49.273]  But former Secret Service agent, FISA memo will destroy image of benevolent Obama.
[01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:54.793]  Call me to teach ethical leadership course at William & Mary.
[01:08:54.793 --> 01:09:01.278]  That's like Jeffrey Dahmer will teach a course on not being a cannibal.
[01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:05.442]  Or I don't know.
[01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:07.584]  Just crazy.
[01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:11.748]  Chicago man files a PAC called I'm gonna assassinate President Donald J. Trump.
[01:09:13.953 --> 01:09:17.494]  California AG says we'll prosecute employers who cooperate with ICE.
[01:09:17.494 --> 01:09:20.115]  You know, that's a federal jurisdiction.
[01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:22.616]  Illegals on the border.
[01:09:22.616 --> 01:09:31.599]  And so then to say, if you follow federal law, and don't hire illegals or reporters or whatever, we're gonna prosecute you.
[01:09:31.599 --> 01:09:33.739]  That's called racketeering.
[01:09:33.739 --> 01:09:36.380]  The very definition.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:42.402]  If you follow the law,
[01:09:44.741 --> 01:10:00.076]  And if you don't commit crimes under our little thing here, our little La Cosa Nostra, our little thing here in California, in these cities, we're going to prosecute you, says the Attorney General.
[01:10:04.215 --> 01:10:10.496]  See, they passed laws in Illinois and California to let illegal aliens vote, but then the AGs would never sign off on it.
[01:10:10.496 --> 01:10:13.437]  They would just kind of disappear them, or the governor would sign them.
[01:10:13.437 --> 01:10:23.939]  But now they're so hyped up and crazy, they're like, listen, we're not even going to convict people that shoot women in the back and basically admit they did it.
[01:10:23.939 --> 01:10:29.160]  And they've got illegal aliens in these hearings, was one this week saying, when I get out of here, I'm going to kill more people.
[01:10:31.442 --> 01:10:33.683]  And the left's like, we're going to release you.
[01:10:33.683 --> 01:10:40.066]  Because it's such an in-your-face thing that the Democrat sheriff got voted out.
[01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:43.088]  A black sheriff here in Travis County.
[01:10:43.088 --> 01:10:44.448]  Just pointing out, you know, everybody's a racist.
[01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:45.489]  He was a huge racist.
[01:10:45.489 --> 01:10:47.630]  He would deport on average three people a week.
[01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.751]  Rapist, arsonist, murderers.
[01:10:49.751 --> 01:10:52.872]  He would give them to ICE out of hundreds and hundreds of illegals arrested.
[01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:54.673]  And they voted him out, man.
[01:10:54.673 --> 01:10:56.454]  Democrats said, no sir, buddy.
[01:10:57.918 --> 01:11:01.420]  Illegal who killed cops wishes he'd kill more of the mother effers.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.641]  I will break out soon and I will kill more.
[01:11:03.641 --> 01:11:04.541]  Yeah, there's video.
[01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:05.261]  We never played it.
[01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.142]  I should have.
[01:11:06.142 --> 01:11:07.242]  Laughing!
[01:11:07.242 --> 01:11:10.444]  I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[01:11:10.444 --> 01:11:20.849]  The Attorney General says, you stand up to that, you report somebody who's illegal, even if they just raped your daughter, I'm gonna put you in prison.
[01:11:20.849 --> 01:11:21.389]  Whoa!
[01:11:22.637 --> 01:11:23.738]  Whoa!
[01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:27.221]  You don't use the proper pronoun for someone, man or woman.
[01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:30.203]  You call somebody man or woman and they didn't want to be called, you're going to jail.
[01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:31.064]  What?
[01:11:31.064 --> 01:11:36.948]  This sounds like the Tea Party, you know, out of Alice in Wonderland.
[01:11:36.948 --> 01:11:38.049]  But they're not crazy.
[01:11:38.049 --> 01:11:42.633]  They're overturning everything to create destruction.
[01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:44.594]  Here's that clip from CNN, though.
[01:11:44.594 --> 01:11:51.300]  Again, last March, saying that we made up the illegal spying, which is all confirmed and triplicate.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:51.580]  Here it is.
[01:11:52.512 --> 01:12:01.188]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on the kind of fringe right-wing media.
[01:12:05.734 --> 01:12:13.537]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:18.919]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:25.722]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[01:12:26.062 --> 01:12:39.086]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[01:12:39.086 --> 01:12:39.466]  Nothing.
[01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:43.807]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[01:12:43.807 --> 01:12:47.708]  I mean, those guys look like they'd kill you for a stick of bubblegum.
[01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:50.549]  I mean, they look disingenuous.
[01:12:50.549 --> 01:12:53.450]  But of course, they also are disingenuous and big fat liars.
[01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:54.330]  Just look at these two.
[01:12:55.657 --> 01:12:57.459]  Think they're in love with themselves?
[01:12:57.459 --> 01:13:03.687]  So here is Congressman Gates and others are saying they have seen the FISA document.
[01:13:03.687 --> 01:13:11.637]  It is something they say is so criminal, so over the top, that these people are all going to go to jail if the Attorney General does his job.
[01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:11.918]  Here it is.
[01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:16.055]  I think that this will not end just with firings.
[01:13:16.055 --> 01:13:18.797]  I believe there are people who will go to jail.
[01:13:18.797 --> 01:13:29.884]  I was very persuaded by the evidence, and it also became clear to me why Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham felt it so important to refer this matter for criminal prosecution.
[01:13:29.884 --> 01:13:35.047]  You don't get to try to undermine our country, undermine our elections, and then simply get fired.
[01:13:35.047 --> 01:13:40.010]  So I think there will be criminal implications here, and we have to underscore the point that you and Jim Jordan just made.
[01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:48.637]  Every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information.
[01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:51.819]  So you know they're going to fight against release to the American people.
[01:13:51.819 --> 01:13:53.601]  What are the Democrats so afraid of?
[01:13:53.601 --> 01:14:02.048]  Why don't they want the American people to know the truth about what was going on with the government, how that impacted the President, his transition, his campaign?
[01:14:02.048 --> 01:14:09.774]  And it just seems interesting to me that Democrats don't want us to know what the entire basis was in the first place for the Mueller probe.
[01:14:10.014 --> 01:14:19.442]  They want to drag this out through the midterm elections to try to embarrass this president and distract this Congress from the critical work we've got to do to save this great country.
[01:14:19.442 --> 01:14:21.304]  Let's release the documents.
[01:14:21.304 --> 01:14:28.330]  And the full clips are up on Infowars.com of Gates, of Jim Jordan, going over it all.
[01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.432]  It's classified so they can't release it yet.
[01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.813]  The Democrats fought.
[01:14:31.813 --> 01:14:37.257]  They had the Democrat cabal inside the FBI, Democrat cabal inside the Justice Department, directed by Hillary and Obama.
[01:14:38.018 --> 01:14:49.888]  We had that map last week that we kept showing, or this week, you know, that shows like the crime chart, and it's all confirmed now, right down to the American people, right to the FISA court, right to the whole system.
[01:14:49.888 --> 01:15:00.016]  And so just like they had that compartmentalized in Congress, the Democrats are like, no, no, no, don't, don't look at the warrant, because it's got El Presidente's fingerprints on it.
[01:15:00.016 --> 01:15:01.237]  Now there's the map.
[01:15:01.237 --> 01:15:04.180]  So you've got Lynch and Comey under Obama.
[01:15:05.575 --> 01:15:20.966]  And then you've got Sally Yates, and you've got Andrew McCabe, and you've got Orr, and Carlin, and Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok, and Baker, and PriceTap, and then Fusion GPS, and the Russian dossier.
[01:15:20.966 --> 01:15:27.191]  They pay for it, they create it, the group of their underlings do it, they get paid government money to create the fabrication.
[01:15:28.214 --> 01:15:28.694]  The fraud.
[01:15:28.694 --> 01:15:40.083]  And then they shovel it out through the media, and now the Democrats in Congress, like Peter Shipp and the rest of them, fight like drowning rats.
[01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:48.349]  Scrabbling, scrabbling as the water rises in an attempt to get out their bee-red eyes, rubbing their rat-like hands together.
[01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:53.733]  What are we going to do politically as the water of truth rises?
[01:15:56.542 --> 01:15:57.763]  Hear that?
[01:15:57.763 --> 01:16:03.147]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:03.147 --> 01:16:06.049]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:09.612]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:18:56.701 --> 01:19:00.125]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:04.090]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:07.434]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:07.434 --> 01:19:09.977]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:09.977 --> 01:19:14.342]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:19:14.702 --> 01:19:24.045]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:24.045 --> 01:19:31.248]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:32.248 --> 01:19:37.311]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:44.954]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:19:44.954 --> 01:19:49.857]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:19:49.857 --> 01:19:52.778]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:13.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.152 --> 01:20:23.860]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.985]  So, we talk a lot about how there's parallel universes and the global is controlled media
[01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:41.375]  Claims that we are living in some fake echo chamber, libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, common sense people, and they're living in the real world.
[01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:59.590]  Well really, this FISA document, and the fact that Congress has it, and the fact that Obama did order the illegal spying with false info on Trump, has been out now for a couple days, and there's been almost no news coverage of it, except on places like DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:21:02.495 --> 01:21:07.156]  And Newsweek is saying that it's a conspiracy theory, still.
[01:21:07.156 --> 01:21:12.138]  That none of this existed, nobody ever spied on the President or anybody else.
[01:21:12.138 --> 01:21:22.480]  Even when it's now admitted in Congressional testimony, and Comey's been caught perjuring himself, it just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:30.503]  And now we've got Hannity coming out saying, you know, disband the Russiagate, it's a total fraud.
[01:21:30.503 --> 01:21:32.043]  And they spin it, oh you're scared of it!
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:38.944]  No, it's a total fraud created by Democrat Party holdovers inside the Justice Department.
[01:21:38.944 --> 01:21:40.785]  We now understand it's a total fraud.
[01:21:40.785 --> 01:21:44.347]  There's nothing to fear, but I'll tell you this, I say leave it there.
[01:21:44.347 --> 01:21:50.451]  It's so embarrassing to the establishment, but President Trump reportedly is agreeing to meet with Mueller?
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:22:04.908]  I'm sure the President knows what he's doing, but he better record it, because Mueller will come out and tell a lie, just like Comey did, because Mueller is involved with the Communist Chinese, the Russians, he has waivers from the Justice Department to do so.
[01:22:04.908 --> 01:22:06.610]  These are the bad actors.
[01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:10.512]  They're really bad people.
[01:22:10.512 --> 01:22:13.694]  This is a very, very critical time to be alive right now.
[01:22:13.694 --> 01:22:15.556]  Let's play a clip of Hannity talking about this.
[01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:31.390]  Now at the end of all of this, we're going to learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel Robert Mueller and his band of Democratic witch hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately.
[01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:34.232]  And here's why Strzok and Page are connected to everything.
[01:22:34.232 --> 01:22:40.597]  What we're learning tonight is that these two trumpeting individuals, they're at the heart and soul and center of it all.
[01:22:40.597 --> 01:22:43.680]  We still have 9,600 texts.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.982]  Let's put that map back up if we can to the different players.
[01:22:46.914 --> 01:22:54.197]  Hannity, I'm not criticizing Hannity because he's got more courage than anybody else on mainstream television, but this is still watered down.
[01:22:54.197 --> 01:22:59.579]  Most of these people are involved with the Russians and the Chinese and covering up previous Clinton crimes.
[01:22:59.579 --> 01:23:08.043]  So they're not just creating a fraud to derail the election of a patriotic great president.
[01:23:08.043 --> 01:23:09.403]  They're not just witch hunters.
[01:23:09.403 --> 01:23:11.144]  They're not just haters.
[01:23:11.144 --> 01:23:16.546]  They organized criminal activity to defraud the American voter of this recovery.
[01:23:17.762 --> 01:23:20.624]  So it's much, much worse than what Hannity's saying.
[01:23:20.624 --> 01:23:23.866]  The Russia investigation's been dead for months.
[01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:26.769]  It's like shooting an old dead horse 50 more times.
[01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:30.011]  It's still a dead horse.
[01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:37.556]  The issue is, what are these people going to dig up next, and are we going to sit there and put up with them?
[01:23:37.556 --> 01:23:42.620]  I know Hannity doesn't want to sound too extreme, but they are extreme.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.981]  Obama ran this whole thing.
[01:23:43.981 --> 01:23:45.022]  He needs to go to prison.
[01:23:46.274 --> 01:23:48.235]  These people aren't above the law.
[01:23:48.235 --> 01:23:49.176]  These aren't Americans.
[01:23:49.176 --> 01:23:51.838]  These are globalists.
[01:23:51.838 --> 01:23:53.600]  Oh, it'll cause a civil war.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.782]  They're already trying to cause one.
[01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.743]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:02.086]  We have to attack them legally and lawfully.
[01:24:02.086 --> 01:24:04.167]  We have to go after Soros.
[01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:05.629]  We have to defeat them all.
[01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:09.732]  They're not going to stop.
[01:24:09.732 --> 01:24:12.394]  Like World War II, you don't just kick Hitler back into Germany.
[01:24:12.394 --> 01:24:14.035]  He's going to reconstitute and attack again.
[01:24:20.111 --> 01:24:25.034]  You don't just kick the Japanese out of the Pacific Islands, you gotta go all the way to Tokyo!
[01:24:25.034 --> 01:24:27.556]  They started it!
[01:24:27.556 --> 01:24:30.417]  You think I wanna keep going up against these people when they're after me?
[01:24:30.417 --> 01:24:30.718]  No!
[01:24:30.718 --> 01:24:32.479]  But whatever has to happen is gonna happen.
[01:24:32.479 --> 01:24:35.120]  We're going all the way against these people, period.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.121]  We have to do it.
[01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:38.402]  There's no other choice.
[01:24:38.402 --> 01:24:47.008]  They've all gotta politically hang for their crimes.
[01:24:47.008 --> 01:24:47.628]  And incidentally,
[01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:55.212]  You know what the punishment for treason is.
[01:24:55.212 --> 01:24:58.255]  These are the foreign individuals that took our country over.
[01:24:58.255 --> 01:25:03.779]  They're the ones that corrupted everything, almost to the point of the country's death, and they're still trying to strangle the country today.
[01:25:03.779 --> 01:25:06.961]  We must stand against them.
[01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:10.624]  All right, moving along.
[01:25:10.624 --> 01:25:19.791]  Just looking into an area of total fraud, total disingenuousness, total upside-down world is Bono.
[01:25:21.031 --> 01:25:26.135]  Of YouTube, that I guess might have been cool 30 years ago.
[01:25:26.135 --> 01:25:42.328]  That is the propaganda arm of the UN, the globalists, every pump and dump scheme, every scam to go have African aid, and then you learn that Bono's charity gives less than 1%, and under pressure, he gives 1.2%.
[01:25:42.328 --> 01:25:47.452]  Bono's One Foundation gives under 1%, under fire.
[01:25:47.452 --> 01:25:48.613]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:25:48.613 --> 01:25:49.734]  Daily Mail, you name it.
[01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:53.837]  He's worse than the Clintons.
[01:25:53.837 --> 01:25:58.562]  They gave like two and a half percent to Haiti and stole all the rest.
[01:25:58.562 --> 01:25:59.123]  Doesn't matter though.
[01:25:59.123 --> 01:26:03.988]  He can virtue signal and have a big music video showing dead kids washing up on the shore.
[01:26:03.988 --> 01:26:09.114]  It's our fault Muslims are killing each other and showing the KKK marching.
[01:26:13.865 --> 01:26:25.628]  This guy's so dialed into everything on Spotify or on your car, you have to go in and program it not to force feed you Bono songs.
[01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:28.428]  You can look it up in the news, they default force feed you him.
[01:26:28.428 --> 01:26:35.230]  I mean, they are the biggest globalist whores on the planet.
[01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:36.830]  And they're the ones
[01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:57.297]  Robbing the world and then having graphics of Moloff cocktails telling you to go out and burn down cracker land.
[01:26:57.297 --> 01:27:05.101]  Fight back with a Moloff cocktail and stop being a slave of the system.
[01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:14.543]  That's right, don't get the tax cuts, don't get the healthcare, don't get a stabilized economy, don't get a world built for people that believes in people, no.
[01:27:14.543 --> 01:27:21.026]  And then a bunch of iconography about death.
[01:27:21.026 --> 01:27:29.350]  Oh, but then showing you a bunch of children of the world all living together, but under who?
[01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.770]  Under who?
[01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:33.012]  Who's gonna run the big world government?
[01:27:33.012 --> 01:27:35.033]  Who's gonna control the big world government?
[01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:36.999]  Who's going to direct it?
[01:27:36.999 --> 01:27:39.180]  Oh, it's a secret TPP.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.221]  It's a secret directorate.
[01:27:41.221 --> 01:27:42.382]  You can't even know what it is.
[01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:51.687]  It's kind of like, oh, Congress can't even see the FISA warrant against Trump because it's the Fusion GPS and was directed by Obama.
[01:27:51.687 --> 01:27:58.531]  We know Susan Rice and all of them that were unmasking, privately going into everybody's data, their phones, their emails.
[01:27:58.531 --> 01:28:05.095]  They were just sitting in the White House, peering over Ivanka Trump and peering over Melania Trump.
[01:28:06.425 --> 01:28:08.246]  Pouring over Don Jr.
[01:28:08.246 --> 01:28:12.929]  and Donald Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.
[01:28:12.929 --> 01:28:19.073]  Just in there, beavering away, and then leaking stuff to the press, but 90% false.
[01:28:19.073 --> 01:28:27.499]  But enough truth in it to make it believable in something beyond the East German spousy could ever have imagined.
[01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:37.942]  And then they still have the New York Times and CNN saying none of it's true, none of it's true, as they have hearings and admit it's all true.
[01:28:37.942 --> 01:28:46.287]  As they hang on by their fingernails, but the wind gets stronger and stronger, and now they're hanging on by one hand, and they're never gonna hang on.
[01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.729]  Even if they kill the president, they're done.
[01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:50.490]  The globalists are done.
[01:28:50.490 --> 01:28:53.512]  This current crop of criminals screwed the pooch.
[01:28:53.512 --> 01:28:54.372]  You have been defeated.
[01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.633]  You have been defeated.
[01:28:56.033 --> 01:28:56.934]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:56.934 --> 01:28:59.335]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:07.461]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.461 --> 01:29:09.402]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:09.402 --> 01:29:13.104]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:13.104 --> 01:29:17.828]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:17.828 --> 01:29:22.291]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:22.931]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:26.433 --> 01:29:27.234]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:29:27.234 --> 01:29:29.055]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:29.055 --> 01:29:30.695]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:30.695 --> 01:29:33.517]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:33.517 --> 01:29:35.818]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:35.818 --> 01:29:40.320]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.262]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:44.262 --> 01:29:48.044]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:48.044 --> 01:29:48.364]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:29:48.364 --> 01:29:49.785]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:57.302 --> 01:30:02.446]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:30:02.446 --> 01:30:07.229]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:15.916]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:30:15.916 --> 01:30:19.158]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:30:19.418 --> 01:30:24.662]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:30:24.662 --> 01:30:31.969]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:30:31.969 --> 01:30:35.872]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:30:35.872 --> 01:30:40.616]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:30:40.616 --> 01:30:44.179]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:45.799]  We're good to go.
[01:31:07.233 --> 01:31:11.876]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:31:11.876 --> 01:31:14.217]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:31:14.217 --> 01:31:15.998]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:31:15.998 --> 01:31:21.261]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:31:21.261 --> 01:31:22.882]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:31:23.622 --> 01:31:29.225]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:31:29.225 --> 01:31:31.066]  Secret 12.
[01:31:31.066 --> 01:31:32.226]  Optimal absorption.
[01:31:32.226 --> 01:31:37.369]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:31:37.369 --> 01:31:42.451]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:31:42.451 --> 01:31:43.292]  Optimum levels.
[01:31:44.805 --> 01:31:51.413]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:32:05.251 --> 01:32:16.079]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:32:16.079 --> 01:32:18.200]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.203]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.404]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[01:32:23.644 --> 01:32:29.448]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:32:29.448 --> 01:32:31.830]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:37.273]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:32:37.273 --> 01:32:40.235]  Infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[01:32:40.235 --> 01:32:48.961]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:32:48.961 --> 01:32:53.404]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:32:59.549 --> 01:33:02.191]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.313 --> 01:33:25.197]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:25.197 --> 01:33:27.319]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.319 --> 01:33:29.641]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:29.641 --> 01:33:33.605]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[01:33:33.605 --> 01:33:34.766]  And we are back live!
[01:33:43.974 --> 01:33:55.951]  You know, Bono and you two have a lot of nerve putting out a new music video saying that the president is a KKK member and that members of his staff at home go home at night to their families and hang up their KKK robes.
[01:33:55.951 --> 01:33:59.576]  It's simply incredible because there's no proof, there's no truth.
[01:34:00.117 --> 01:34:14.257]  to it, but on top of that it's defamation, it's slander, it's an attempt to create race war that we know is in the WikiLeaks, where the Democrats talk about creating culture war and race war as a way to maintain control, but the biggest issue is the Daily Mail and others report
[01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:25.839]  That U2 is on record and Bono keeping 99% or more of the money from mainly African charities they run.
[01:34:25.839 --> 01:34:28.821]  So they have these big music telethons broadcast worldwide.
[01:34:28.821 --> 01:34:30.683]  Sometimes they raise over a billion dollars.
[01:34:30.683 --> 01:34:34.526]  They keep 99% personally.
[01:34:34.526 --> 01:34:38.409]  Bono's one foundation under fire for giving little over 1%.
[01:34:38.409 --> 01:34:40.251]  First it was 0.8, now they give 1.2.
[01:34:42.032 --> 01:34:44.835]  Think about what a monster he is.
[01:34:44.835 --> 01:34:46.596]  But!
[01:34:46.596 --> 01:34:48.698]  Lowest black unemployment ever recorded.
[01:34:48.698 --> 01:34:51.580]  Trump targeting abortion, which targets mainly blacks.
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.741]  52% being aborted.
[01:34:52.741 --> 01:34:56.625]  Trump trying to move factories back into the African-American areas.
[01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:59.047]  All that's the proof.
[01:34:59.047 --> 01:34:59.948]  Doesn't matter.
[01:34:59.948 --> 01:35:02.009]  Bono says he's KKK.
[01:35:02.009 --> 01:35:08.035]  Think about how that's a perfect cover for what he is really up to.
[01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:08.175]  Now,
[01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:17.095]  Joining us is an amazing lady with billions of views of her videos and articles just on Facebook and Twitter alone.
[01:35:17.095 --> 01:35:18.896]  Most of you know who she is.
[01:35:18.896 --> 01:35:20.977]  I've followed her for years.
[01:35:20.977 --> 01:35:26.881]  And she's able to mobilize conservatives, libertarians, Christians, just people that are common sense, activist mommy.
[01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:39.362]  To be able to go look at what's happening in the schools, where they're teaching children to masturbation, where children's magazines are teaching little girls about anal sex, so that they depopulate.
[01:35:39.362 --> 01:35:42.342]  Just all sorts of incredible things.
[01:35:42.342 --> 01:35:53.005]  The latest thing is the promotion of sex toys to little girls, and also prosthetic penises, so that they can learn to be transgender.
[01:35:53.005 --> 01:35:56.046]  Even Camille Paglia, who's more of a liberal lesbian, says this is child abuse.
[01:35:56.846 --> 01:36:03.669]  Meanwhile, no leftist criticism of Turkish state moving to legalize marrying girls age 9.
[01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:08.932]  Netflix hosting shows about sex with children and how great it is.
[01:36:08.932 --> 01:36:10.813]  Salon pushing it.
[01:36:10.813 --> 01:36:12.894]  They're not getting banned from Twitter.
[01:36:12.894 --> 01:36:15.135]  She has been banned from Twitter.
[01:36:16.754 --> 01:36:28.884]  And we've been contacted by Twitter, and they said if you use the T word, must use transgender, if you use the name that that community created themselves, you will be banned.
[01:36:28.884 --> 01:36:32.707]  And I said to the guys, we documented it all, took the phone calls, recorded it, told them we were.
[01:36:32.707 --> 01:36:38.911]  I said, let's watch the process of this when there's new words, and they've called, there's new words.
[01:36:38.911 --> 01:36:40.172]  So what it is, is just training.
[01:36:41.132 --> 01:36:43.593]  And pretty soon they'll tell you what you gotta do or you're gone.
[01:36:43.593 --> 01:36:45.973]  But we're making a documentary out of it, letting Twitter know that.
[01:36:45.973 --> 01:36:56.856]  We've infiltrated them, as you know, in Project Veritas as well, where they go, oh, we do what the Communist Chinese tell us, and what the Democrats tell us, and we record women naked and we save it on our computers, ha ha ha.
[01:36:56.856 --> 01:36:58.497]  It's all very, very funny to them.
[01:36:58.497 --> 01:37:00.157]  And they're the new ruling class.
[01:37:00.157 --> 01:37:02.498]  They're the technocrats.
[01:37:02.498 --> 01:37:06.819]  So, put into abstentia, put into the memory hole.
[01:37:06.819 --> 01:37:08.660]  And people say, well, that's their own platform.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.580]  But they're discriminatory.
[01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:13.206]  The left sues you if you don't bake a gay couple's cake.
[01:37:13.206 --> 01:37:15.747]  I mean, I'd do it, because I just think it's free market.
[01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:17.709]  But the point is, if you want to, it should be your right.
[01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:19.630]  Oh, that's a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar fine.
[01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:26.174]  But if you want to say you're a Christian and teaching five-year-old girls how to have anal sex is wrong, you're banned.
[01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:29.056]  So the activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, joins us.
[01:37:29.776 --> 01:37:34.680]  I don't know if you saw Trump about an hour ago giving the first ever Republican speech to the Right to Life march.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.861]  This is a pretty seismic deal.
[01:37:53.676 --> 01:38:04.503]  They don't know what to do about Trump because it seems like he's breaking their will and giving everybody else the courage to stand against this cultural jihad to shut down free speech that the left's been on.
[01:38:04.503 --> 01:38:07.505]  So thanks for joining us.
[01:38:07.505 --> 01:38:09.386]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:38:09.386 --> 01:38:09.986]  It's good to have you.
[01:38:09.986 --> 01:38:10.927]  Where do you want to start?
[01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:16.250]  I mean, the censorship, the latest sexualization of children, what's going on?
[01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.050]  Oh, you tell me.
[01:38:24.161 --> 01:38:25.626]  I did not use the T-word.
[01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:30.830]  You know, we're going to do something here.
[01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:33.211]  I know you do big videos and big shows all the time.
[01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:35.191]  That's probably on our end, but we're going to get your phone number.
[01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:36.692]  It's great to be able to see you on Skype.
[01:38:36.692 --> 01:38:42.634]  We're going to call you right back on backup and get you on that way because we're going to check our Skype system here or whatever.
[01:38:42.634 --> 01:38:43.875]  It's been having some issues.
[01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:46.315]  Seems to be better in that studio, but maybe it's just me.
[01:38:46.315 --> 01:38:47.676]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:38:47.676 --> 01:38:50.437]  We're going to figure that out and see if we can get her on air with us.
[01:38:50.437 --> 01:38:51.618]  But I mean, just think about this.
[01:38:51.618 --> 01:38:57.840]  I really just wanted to have her on because she's someone who's been put into a memory hole.
[01:38:58.982 --> 01:39:02.183]  See someone who's been shot off into space.
[01:39:02.183 --> 01:39:04.284]  And you know InfoWars is next.
[01:39:04.284 --> 01:39:07.145]  You know Paul Watson's next.
[01:39:07.145 --> 01:39:11.006]  And we've got video of them saying, hey, we're censoring Jones on YouTube.
[01:39:11.006 --> 01:39:12.206]  We don't want people sharing the videos.
[01:39:12.206 --> 01:39:16.647]  You just got to go to his Alex Jones channel to find him.
[01:39:16.647 --> 01:39:19.368]  And if we see something trending, we block it.
[01:39:19.368 --> 01:39:22.289]  Because they know there's major lawsuit liability for them.
[01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.470]  So they have to act like they're still allowing us to be there.
[01:39:25.285 --> 01:39:31.629]  They have the congressional hearings with the Twitter, Facebook, and Google executives where they're sitting there in everyone's face.
[01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:34.811]  But there's one way you can stop them.
[01:39:34.811 --> 01:39:40.394]  And that is to continue to support us on AM and FM stations, local TV stations more and more picking us up.
[01:39:40.394 --> 01:39:41.995]  That's our big push this year.
[01:39:41.995 --> 01:39:43.897]  We're getting some new satellites we'll announce the next month.
[01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:49.712]  And just as important as that, it's critical for you to financially support us.
[01:39:49.712 --> 01:39:52.093]  We've got some huge specials running right now.
[01:39:52.093 --> 01:39:53.814]  They're going to have to end very, very soon.
[01:39:53.814 --> 01:40:01.017]  We are selling out of Survival Shield X2, the Good Halogen with the True Atomic Nation Iodine, and Secret 12.
[01:40:01.017 --> 01:40:09.361]  That's the InfoWars Life Core Combo Pack, and it's 40% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:09.361 --> 01:40:11.742]  The InfoWars Life Core Combo Pack.
[01:40:13.166 --> 01:40:15.910]  Is 40% off right now.
[01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:22.358]  There's no reviews because we just launched a special yesterday, but both these items have thousands of five-star reviews individually.
[01:40:22.358 --> 01:40:28.866]  It averaged, what, 96% score for X2 and Secret 12 by third-party sites like Power Reviews.
[01:40:30.592 --> 01:40:39.779]  Get your Survival Shield X2 and your Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:39.779 --> 01:40:42.961]  And without your support, we will not be here.
[01:40:42.961 --> 01:40:51.848]  So, when you get a t-shirt, when you get a book, when you get an air filter, a water filter, when you get into the other materials that are there, thousands of great items, it makes it all possible.
[01:40:51.848 --> 01:40:55.211]  Here's a Survival Shield X2 review.
[01:40:55.211 --> 01:40:56.212]  Excellent to the max.
[01:40:57.398 --> 01:41:01.324]  Says wrongfully accused hippies out of Maryland.
[01:41:01.324 --> 01:41:05.090]  Wow, we are so excited with this one.
[01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:07.914]  It is so vigorous, life-affirming taste.
[01:41:07.914 --> 01:41:10.659]  We always buy this as soon as we run out.
[01:41:12.315 --> 01:41:16.498]  Continuing, this is from Candice, non-disclosed location.
[01:41:16.498 --> 01:41:17.619]  This stuff is the best.
[01:41:17.619 --> 01:41:19.280]  Never go a day without it.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:19.941]  Five stars.
[01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:21.342]  Five stars.
[01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:23.504]  Clean and efficient product.
[01:41:23.504 --> 01:41:23.884]  Love it.
[01:41:23.884 --> 01:41:25.245]  Five stars.
[01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.367]  We just print the latest reviews in order.
[01:41:27.367 --> 01:41:29.248]  We're not even cherry-picking these.
[01:41:29.248 --> 01:41:30.689]  Here's another one from
[01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:33.392]  Jar Slav.
[01:41:33.392 --> 01:41:34.873]  Five stars.
[01:41:34.873 --> 01:41:36.535]  He's from an out of his clothes location.
[01:41:36.535 --> 01:41:37.877]  Verified purchaser.
[01:41:37.877 --> 01:41:43.943]  I purchased this one and I am talking with some other supplements from InfoWars and working great.
[01:41:43.943 --> 01:41:45.004]  Tastes amazing.
[01:41:45.004 --> 01:41:48.488]  And now all my family is taking it every morning.
[01:41:48.488 --> 01:41:49.108]  That's on Secret 12.
[01:41:50.475 --> 01:41:52.056]  Here's another one.
[01:41:52.056 --> 01:41:55.519]  This is Never Felt Better, Charles.
[01:41:55.519 --> 01:41:56.499]  Undisclosed.
[01:41:56.499 --> 01:41:58.221]  Here's another one, Leon.
[01:41:58.221 --> 01:42:00.923]  Says, love the taste and very easy to take.
[01:42:00.923 --> 01:42:02.724]  They're all talking about secret 12.
[01:42:02.724 --> 01:42:05.486]  People say, why does pure B12 taste so good?
[01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:07.067]  It's like a precursor to your whole body.
[01:42:07.067 --> 01:42:08.428]  You got to have it.
[01:42:08.428 --> 01:42:09.989]  X2 is just incredible.
[01:42:09.989 --> 01:42:12.171]  I take it in water, take it right under the tongue.
[01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:15.894]  And again, if you want to do something for yourself,
[01:42:17.737 --> 01:42:20.439]  More vitamin C and more high-quality iodine.
[01:42:20.439 --> 01:42:24.502]  You die without both of these, and a vitamin C is plentiful.
[01:42:24.502 --> 01:42:33.769]  Iodine is just one of the things that people are so deficient in, and not the bound iodine, the sodium iodine, the other garbage out there, but the real iodine.
[01:42:33.769 --> 01:42:36.211]  We've got true atomic pure iodine.
[01:42:36.211 --> 01:42:37.912]  Available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:40.914 --> 01:42:44.078]  Oh, and we have the new Pollen Block that folks are really loving.
[01:42:44.078 --> 01:42:45.199]  Check out Pollen Block.
[01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:47.562]  It's a Japanese quail egg.
[01:42:47.562 --> 01:42:49.944]  The quailers have a special diet.
[01:42:49.944 --> 01:42:51.046]  They don't know why.
[01:42:51.046 --> 01:42:52.728]  It's so good for seasonal distress.
[01:42:52.728 --> 01:42:55.210]  You know, the stuff with the sinuses.
[01:42:56.031 --> 01:42:57.633]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:42:57.633 --> 01:43:00.215]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[01:43:00.215 --> 01:43:07.722]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:43:07.722 --> 01:43:17.872]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:43:18.352 --> 01:43:26.194]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:43:26.194 --> 01:43:36.395]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:43:36.395 --> 01:43:38.436]  And this part is most important.
[01:43:38.436 --> 01:43:44.917]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:43:45.257 --> 01:43:46.700]  That means it's clean.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.823]  That means it's pure.
[01:43:47.823 --> 01:43:50.728]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:43:50.728 --> 01:43:53.534]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:43:53.534 --> 01:43:55.157]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:43:56.471 --> 01:43:57.252]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:57.252 --> 01:44:07.399]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:07.399 --> 01:44:15.926]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:15.926 --> 01:44:24.713]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:26.789 --> 01:44:34.993]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:34.993 --> 01:44:46.378]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:46.378 --> 01:44:49.059]  It is amazing!
[01:44:49.059 --> 01:44:54.021]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:44:57.006 --> 01:45:01.387]  Fill your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life.
[01:45:01.387 --> 01:45:09.469]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:45:09.469 --> 01:45:14.770]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:17.290]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:21.511]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:45:21.511 --> 01:45:23.952]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:31.872]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:45:31.872 --> 01:45:39.955]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:45:39.955 --> 01:45:47.138]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:45:47.138 --> 01:45:48.598]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:45:48.598 --> 01:45:50.399]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:54.706]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:45:54.706 --> 01:45:56.428]  That's Infowarslife.com
[01:45:58.721 --> 01:46:17.112]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm actually speaking for hours on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:23.396]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:46:23.396 --> 01:46:24.777]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:24.777 --> 01:46:27.339]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:46:27.999 --> 01:46:29.539]  And so much more.
[01:46:29.539 --> 01:46:30.880]  It is concentrated.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.620]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:38.422]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:46:38.422 --> 01:46:39.642]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:46:39.642 --> 01:46:41.663]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:46:41.663 --> 01:46:44.243]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:46:44.243 --> 01:46:45.684]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:46:45.684 --> 01:46:48.044]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:46:48.044 --> 01:46:48.765]  Immune Wall.
[01:46:48.765 --> 01:46:50.205]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:50.205 --> 01:46:51.365]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:47:00.498 --> 01:47:03.100]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:18.223 --> 01:47:23.009]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:47:23.009 --> 01:47:24.751]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:24.751 --> 01:47:26.413]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:26.413 --> 01:47:31.138]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.373 --> 01:47:37.234]  Look at this report from LifeSite.
[01:47:37.234 --> 01:47:46.697]  Facebook says group wanting to burn alive Christian mom meets community standards, but she's banned from Twitter.
[01:47:46.697 --> 01:47:55.981]  So we're going to talk to a lady who's reached billions of people and who they're targeting and who's been banned from Twitter, the activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston.
[01:47:55.981 --> 01:48:03.244]  So Elizabeth, let's get into why you're so hated, why you're so feared, and why they're trying to ban you.
[01:48:05.205 --> 01:48:09.849]  Hi Alex, I'm so sorry about the technical problems we've had.
[01:48:09.849 --> 01:48:18.317]  Look, you know, I don't toe the line and I am pushing back against some of their pet agendas.
[01:48:18.317 --> 01:48:30.127]  I push back against the feminazis and the LGBT agenda and the slaughtering of children through abortion, brainwashing our children to think Islam is a religion of peace.
[01:48:30.945 --> 01:48:38.876]  These are the things that I address on my platform through articles and videos that I create.
[01:48:41.539 --> 01:48:44.301]  You know, I am being censored frequently.
[01:48:44.301 --> 01:48:55.027]  I last year was banned from Facebook for first three days and then seven days for quoting just simply what the Bible says about homosexuality.
[01:48:55.027 --> 01:49:03.472]  That was a worldwide story that hit Fox & Friends and Drudge Report and the New York Times and of course Facebook apologized.
[01:49:04.148 --> 01:49:07.390]  And they restored my account back to me.
[01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:13.972]  And right now there's a story going that there's a group on Facebook called I Will Find Activist Mommy and Burn Whoever Runs It Alive.
[01:49:25.217 --> 01:49:39.810]  And people, hundreds, thousands of people have reported it and Facebook said that that death threat does not go against their community standards and they're not going to remove the group from Facebook.
[01:49:39.810 --> 01:49:51.440]  It's amazing and the same stuff happens to me, it happens to Trump, it happens to everybody who's prominently just promoting traditionalist values that are not being tolerated, that are under siege and I noticed they let
[01:49:52.389 --> 01:49:56.971]  Transgenders use the other T word that we can't use or we're banned.
[01:49:56.971 --> 01:50:01.192]  So it's also very discriminatory that that term's in newspapers.
[01:50:01.192 --> 01:50:11.736]  And I was reading, it says, Wikipedia says, Twitter decided in 2017 that it was a hate word, even though it's a word that comes from that very group.
[01:50:11.736 --> 01:50:17.958]  So even if we buckle under and only use words they use, they'll then tell us that we can't use a word but they can.
[01:50:17.958 --> 01:50:20.079]  This is true authoritarianism.
[01:50:21.428 --> 01:50:24.089]  It is George Orwell's 1984 for sure.
[01:50:24.089 --> 01:50:28.351]  The thing is though, Alex, I don't use that term.
[01:50:28.351 --> 01:50:31.413]  And that's not why I'm banned from Twitter.
[01:50:31.413 --> 01:50:42.158]  The reason Twitter banned me is because I said that a transgender teenager who committed suicide, poor child, committed suicide
[01:50:42.981 --> 01:50:52.505]  He claimed it was because the high school that he attended did not allow him to change his sex, his name, until he was 16.
[01:50:52.505 --> 01:51:00.188]  That was the policy of the school, and supposedly that was the reason that this boy was so unhappy and committed suicide.
[01:51:00.188 --> 01:51:06.130]  I made the comment on Twitter with this article four months ago, Alex.
[01:51:06.130 --> 01:51:10.192]  Four months ago, they just found this and decided to make an issue of it.
[01:51:10.852 --> 01:51:25.717]  I made the comment that the LGBT community is responsible and is harming transgender teenagers by not getting them the psychological and emotional help and counseling that they need.
[01:51:25.717 --> 01:51:36.100]  Forty percent of transgenders attempt to commit suicide versus four percent of the non-transgender, of the general population.
[01:51:36.955 --> 01:51:59.793]  And it clearly transgenders need to get psychological and emotional counseling and it's not being offered to them because the LGBT community is enabling these young people and it's making them feel that they are entitled to their sex changes and their name changes.
[01:51:59.793 --> 01:52:01.595]  I made that type of a comment.
[01:52:02.259 --> 01:52:05.220]  And now I am banned from Twitter for seven days.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:09.302]  You know, they are in essence putting me through sensitivity training right now.
[01:52:09.302 --> 01:52:10.862]  Wow.
[01:52:10.862 --> 01:52:21.727]  And expanding on that, the gay community, which I don't hate anybody, on average diverse group of people, but on average they have the highest level of suicide globally of any group.
[01:52:22.677 --> 01:52:26.619]  And it's not because folks are being mean to them, it's because that community is being mean to them.
[01:52:26.619 --> 01:52:29.441]  I've seen the studies, I've witnessed it for myself.
[01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:33.963]  I've had friends, family, neighbors that are gay, you go to their party, they're being meaner than hell to each other.
[01:52:33.963 --> 01:52:37.325]  I mean, a lot of gay people are really mean.
[01:52:37.325 --> 01:52:43.929]  And let's not lie about that, and let's not lie about how they treat each other, and that lesbians have the highest level of abusing each other.
[01:52:44.249 --> 01:52:46.871]  And I don't hate women that like women.
[01:52:46.871 --> 01:52:51.995]  The whole point is, they don't want to discuss why they have the highest rates of drug use, suicide.
[01:52:51.995 --> 01:53:01.763]  And then in that group, the transgenders are even bigger, and you've got them going into four and five-year-olds in England, telling them you may be something else, and then having major mental illness problems.
[01:53:01.763 --> 01:53:03.024]  Well, of course!
[01:53:03.024 --> 01:53:05.506]  They are sexualizing children.
[01:53:05.506 --> 01:53:07.247]  It's a giant experiment.
[01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:10.750]  It's being run by the Tavistock Institute, and of course it's creating big problems.
[01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.792]  And you point out, as Camille Paglia does,
[01:53:13.012 --> 01:53:26.101]  Yeah, one of the things Alex, one of the things that really has drawn a lot of attention to my platform, I don't know if you heard about it last year, is that I burned a Teen Vogue magazine when Teen Vogue was
[01:53:37.082 --> 01:53:40.906]  Teaching teenagers, kids, how to sodomize one another.
[01:53:40.906 --> 01:53:44.190]  Oh yeah, tell folks about that.
[01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:51.378]  Yeah, they printed a tutorial online of how to have anal sex.
[01:53:52.319 --> 01:53:57.542]  And I was livid, as were millions of parents.
[01:53:57.542 --> 01:54:13.210]  And so I filmed a quick two-minute video, burned a Teen Vogue magazine, called it smut, and called upon the public to go to their stores and their libraries and make sure that Teen Vogue was not
[01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:14.751]  We're good to go.
[01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:43.868]  And by the way, I totally agree, and you've done a great job, that's why they fear you.
[01:54:43.868 --> 01:54:51.492]  Look at how the Metro, the biggest paper in London, printed cartoons of children having sex and told parents to sexualize their children.
[01:54:51.492 --> 01:54:56.674]  We've got countless examples of this in the news, in the TV shows, on Netflix.
[01:54:56.674 --> 01:55:02.237]  This is clearly, in my view, a mainlining of pedophilic culture.
[01:55:02.237 --> 01:55:02.757]  What do you think?
[01:55:04.196 --> 01:55:05.357]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:05.357 --> 01:55:12.443]  I'm sure you're familiar with the book written in, I believe, 1958 called The Naked Communist.
[01:55:12.443 --> 01:55:13.083]  Yes.
[01:55:13.083 --> 01:55:23.872]  And they lay out goals of the Communist Party USA and one of their goals, number 40, is discredit the family as an institution.
[01:55:24.412 --> 01:55:28.493]  Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
[01:55:28.493 --> 01:55:41.038]  Goal number 25 is break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.
[01:55:41.038 --> 01:55:53.722]  Our local law enforcement are cowards, straight up cowards, because they will not enforce the good and decent obscenity laws that are on our books.
[01:55:54.466 --> 01:56:02.656]  Nationwide, every state, every city has great obscenity laws, but no one is enforcing them.
[01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:04.138]  This has to stop.
[01:56:04.138 --> 01:56:09.785]  And now we have pornographic, grassy, gender-bending sex ed.
[01:56:10.425 --> 01:56:14.928]  In our elementary schools and middle schools and high schools.
[01:56:14.928 --> 01:56:23.754]  That's why we started something called Sex Ed Sit Out and I want to ask all of your listeners please to go to Facebook right now.
[01:56:23.754 --> 01:56:28.697]  A bunch of us moms have started a movement called Sex Ed Sit Out and on April 23rd
[01:56:30.712 --> 01:56:37.922]  We are going to pull our children out of the public schools in protest of the pornographic sex ed in the schools.
[01:56:37.922 --> 01:56:44.891]  Please go to Facebook search bar at the top and type in sex ed spit out and like our page and get involved in our movement.
[01:56:45.632 --> 01:57:07.009]  Please come back on for that as soon as we get our Skype fix for yours or whatever it is or phone because absolutely we see this big pushback against this all over the world and they always said oh you're just ignorant you're like Amish or something you don't want people knowing about their body parts give me a break they are sexualizing they are trying to teach young people
[01:57:08.188 --> 01:57:15.934]  Deviant fetish behavior because the left has fetishized sexualizing children.
[01:57:15.934 --> 01:57:20.217]  Even Salon, even the New York Times are promoting pedophilia.
[01:57:20.217 --> 01:57:21.878]  That is the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:57:21.878 --> 01:57:27.603]  I want to come back in two minutes to five more minutes with the activist mommy about where she sees the state.
[01:57:28.763 --> 01:57:30.386]  of the fight today.
[01:57:30.386 --> 01:57:34.292]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:57:34.292 --> 01:57:35.654]  A lot of huge news there.
[01:57:35.654 --> 01:57:37.677]  The way those articles get out is you spreading them.
[01:57:37.677 --> 01:57:38.378]  I know you know that.

[02:00:06.835 --> 02:00:15.320]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:19.263]  That's right, we've been under globalism, our country was under TPP, really was lost its sovereignty.
[02:00:19.263 --> 02:00:21.004]  Trump's turning that around.
[02:00:21.004 --> 02:00:26.107]  Pretty soon we'll have to not play those ladders anymore because they won't be accurate, but we're in the middle of a civil war right now.
[02:00:26.107 --> 02:00:27.208]  What an amazing lady.
[02:00:28.516 --> 02:00:31.258]  Daria, one of our producers, said, why don't you get Activist Mommy on?
[02:00:31.258 --> 02:00:32.518]  And I go, I've been watching her for years.
[02:00:32.518 --> 02:00:34.019]  That lady's really on point.
[02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:36.180]  She leads all these major attacks.
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:37.401]  And they're wanting her dead now.
[02:00:37.401 --> 02:00:38.421]  I said, absolutely.
[02:00:38.421 --> 02:00:40.363]  So I want to get her on any time she wants to come on.
[02:00:40.363 --> 02:00:42.244]  Just an amazing individual.
[02:00:42.244 --> 02:00:46.406]  And I wanted to ask her in this short segment before Peter Schiff joins us on the economy.
[02:00:46.886 --> 02:00:47.666]  We're not flogging it!
[02:01:07.571 --> 02:01:17.379]  The sleeping majority of everybody out there, every race, color, and creed that loves just being decent and trying to not be overtaken by the leftist agenda.
[02:01:17.379 --> 02:01:18.740]  We have to get aggressive.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:19.981]  We have to get out in the field.
[02:01:19.981 --> 02:01:20.822]  We have to take action.
[02:01:20.822 --> 02:01:27.427]  So where are we right now at this juncture, this fight, in your really expert, embattled, frontline view?
[02:01:27.427 --> 02:01:29.709]  And what can people do in the culture war?
[02:01:31.581 --> 02:01:48.089]  Well, Alex, as you're saying, the radical left has waged war against the natural family, you know, father and mother and child, and has waged war against really all things decent.
[02:01:48.089 --> 02:01:49.630]  And we must wake up.
[02:01:50.459 --> 02:01:56.005]  As a culture, as parents, and push back against this indoctrination.
[02:01:56.005 --> 02:02:00.610]  You know, one person burned a Teen Vogue magazine and look at the shockwaves.
[02:02:00.610 --> 02:02:02.152]  Look at what happened.
[02:02:02.152 --> 02:02:12.143]  One person pushing back in your sphere of influence, whether it's going to your city council meeting and saying, no, we're not going to have men in the girls' locker rooms.
[02:02:12.803 --> 02:02:34.397]  Whatever God is calling you to do, use the voice and the passion that He's given you and answer that call and push back against this attack on the family, the attack on decency, the attack on everything that's made America good, and let's work together to make America great again.
[02:02:34.397 --> 02:02:35.598]  I mean, ultimately,
[02:02:36.403 --> 02:02:40.086]  You know, this is a spiritual problem that we have in this nation.
[02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:42.648]  We need to return to our Creator.
[02:02:42.648 --> 02:02:46.030]  We need to turn from our sin and our selfishness.
[02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:57.178]  And we need to get back to the way the Founding Fathers believed our nation should be run as one nation under God.
[02:02:57.178 --> 02:02:57.759]  You're right.
[02:02:57.759 --> 02:03:01.862]  And again, they use our strength against us that America is open, Christianity is tolerant,
[02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:22.455]  And then they've gone from tolerance to now we have to adopt all the things that the left's doing, including hundreds of new bizarre fetishes that are even being taught in school, like being married to a car, having sex with a car, burning your eyeballs out with Drano, and then the government pays for you to be blind, or paying to have sex changes.
[02:03:22.955 --> 02:03:25.138]  I mean, I don't pay for people's nose jobs.
[02:03:25.138 --> 02:03:29.603]  How did we ever get in this position of just these people dictating everything to us?
[02:03:29.603 --> 02:03:36.150]  And not even the average leftist, but these would-be cultural kings.
[02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:37.272]  Oh yeah, you're so right.
[02:03:37.272 --> 02:03:40.555]  I mean, Alex, facts and science and truth matter.
[02:03:42.406 --> 02:03:47.413]  Because I say 2 plus 1 equals 5 doesn't mean, doesn't make it true.
[02:03:47.413 --> 02:03:55.863]  And, you know, this trendy new, you know, phrase that people want to say gender is binary and it's on a spectrum.
[02:03:55.863 --> 02:03:56.985]  No, no.
[02:03:56.985 --> 02:04:00.650]  Biologically, scientifically, we are XXX.
[02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:02.151]  We're good.
[02:04:18.186 --> 02:04:24.088]  As you know, they're firing professors that just point out men and women in the whole mammal species have these chromosomes.
[02:04:24.088 --> 02:04:24.368]  It's crazy.
[02:04:40.515 --> 02:04:43.279]  Activist Mommy, please join us again very soon.
[02:04:43.279 --> 02:04:50.151]  God bless you and good luck with all your work and thank God for our great president today with what we saw at that Pro-Life March.
[02:04:50.151 --> 02:04:50.872]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:50.872 --> 02:04:51.473]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.148 --> 02:05:01.136]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:05:01.136 --> 02:05:05.301]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:05:05.301 --> 02:05:11.549]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:05:13.311 --> 02:05:20.476]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:20.622]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:29.301 --> 02:06:31.343]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:31.343 --> 02:06:33.424]  Roger Stone is joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:33.424 --> 02:06:49.517]  He was the first to report on Obama using Fusion GPS to basically illegally, fraudulently get warrants against candidate Trump, nominee Trump, President-elect Trump, and then I guess ongoing when he was a President, Trump knew about it as the President.
[02:06:49.517 --> 02:06:52.840]  He said it's classified, I can't tell you, but they've spied on me.
[02:06:54.958 --> 02:06:56.619]  And we broke all that news last year.
[02:06:56.619 --> 02:06:59.301]  CNN attacked us, you name it, said it wasn't true.
[02:06:59.301 --> 02:07:05.245]  And now members of Congress that have seen the memo say it's Obama directly ordering it.
[02:07:05.245 --> 02:07:09.288]  And just like in the other memos, they say we gotta stop Trump.
[02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:11.769]  They admit it's a fraud.
[02:07:11.769 --> 02:07:15.812]  It's the arrogance of narcissistic criminals that always brings them down.
[02:07:15.812 --> 02:07:21.196]  Their boldness is something that makes them successful.
[02:07:22.506 --> 02:07:32.878]  And the fact that they leave a trail of destruction behind them and ruin every business they're in or family, they don't care because they're just on to the next scam.
[02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:38.164]  So we're dealing with narcissists, sociopaths, psychopaths, and then mercenaries that'll work for them.
[02:07:38.164 --> 02:07:39.766]  And they just ruin civilization.
[02:07:41.482 --> 02:07:43.204]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:07:43.204 --> 02:07:49.149]  Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com, American businessman, investor, broker, billions under management.
[02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:50.170]  I'm not going to get into his bio.
[02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:50.851]  Everybody knows him.
[02:07:50.851 --> 02:07:55.715]  Best-selling author, run for Senate, things like that.
[02:07:55.715 --> 02:07:59.058]  Was Ron Paul's chief economic advisor.
[02:07:59.058 --> 02:08:00.039]  Always liked getting him on.
[02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:03.142]  I wanted to get him on about the fact that
[02:08:04.582 --> 02:08:07.786]  I predicted that if Trump got in, we'd see the economy explode.
[02:08:07.786 --> 02:08:13.592]  Because, I mean, I knew we had artificial globalist policies in place suppressing our economy.
[02:08:13.592 --> 02:08:23.843]  And I know the whole world's a bubble and all the rest of it, but if you remove the rope tied around us at the dock on the boat, it's going to start running out there into the ocean.
[02:08:23.843 --> 02:08:26.546]  Now, I know that China's a big bubble and we're a big bubble, but
[02:08:28.618 --> 02:08:51.156]  I gotta tell ya, we've had some debates here with Mr. Schiff, who's also believed that there was some chances of big growth, and then we've had some other folks who didn't think that, thought there's no way because of demographic cliffs, and I get demographic cliffs, but if you've got things artificially suppressed here, and then built up there, then if Trump comes in and removes a bunch of regulations and taxes, won't that at least in the interim boost things?
[02:08:51.156 --> 02:08:52.297]  I think you're seeing that.
[02:08:52.297 --> 02:08:53.838]  Krugman said it would never get above 3%.
[02:08:53.838 --> 02:08:54.058]  It's at 3.3.
[02:08:54.058 --> 02:08:54.319]  You see
[02:08:58.837 --> 02:09:02.621]  Trump giving his number one award to the New York Times for betting against America.
[02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:05.564]  So I agree the fundamentals are crazy.
[02:09:05.564 --> 02:09:06.485]  I'm not an economist.
[02:09:06.485 --> 02:09:08.908]  I just study this stuff.
[02:09:08.908 --> 02:09:12.592]  And at the same time, aren't you glad things haven't blown up yet?
[02:09:12.592 --> 02:09:14.214]  The question is, will they?
[02:09:14.214 --> 02:09:14.975]  What's going to happen?
[02:09:14.975 --> 02:09:17.177]  And then what's happening with cryptocurrencies?
[02:09:18.198 --> 02:09:23.365]  Seeming like that bubble is starting to bust as regulators start to go after them.
[02:09:23.365 --> 02:09:28.472]  So we'll find out about this and a lot more from Peter Schiff at Europact.com.
[02:09:28.472 --> 02:09:29.553]  Peter, good to have you back with us.
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.621]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:09:31.621 --> 02:09:34.763]  Happy New Year to you and your audience.
[02:09:34.763 --> 02:09:35.464]  I agree with you.
[02:09:35.464 --> 02:09:38.947]  The economy is going to blow up, but it's going to blow up like a bomb.
[02:09:38.947 --> 02:09:40.368]  It's not a good thing.
[02:09:40.368 --> 02:09:41.949]  It's a bad thing.
[02:09:41.949 --> 02:09:48.314]  Unfortunately, that's what Trump has inherited from Obama, but it's not even really just Obama.
[02:09:48.314 --> 02:09:49.375]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:49.375 --> 02:09:57.422]  It's the monetary policy that has been passed like a baton from Clinton to Bush to Obama and now to Trump.
[02:09:57.902 --> 02:09:59.523]  And we're near the end of the game.
[02:09:59.523 --> 02:10:02.305]  And unfortunately, Trump's going to be the fall guy.
[02:10:02.305 --> 02:10:05.428]  This thing is all going to collapse while he's president.
[02:10:05.428 --> 02:10:07.489]  And he owns the stock market bubble.
[02:10:07.489 --> 02:10:11.192]  He and the Republicans own the economy now, thanks to these tax cuts.
[02:10:11.192 --> 02:10:15.755]  They're not going to make any difference, but they are going to give the Democrats a reason to blame it all
[02:10:16.435 --> 02:10:17.817]  On Trump and the Republicans.
[02:10:17.817 --> 02:10:20.260]  But we are getting closer to this collapse.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:21.841]  You mentioned GDP growth.
[02:10:21.841 --> 02:10:30.331]  Last year, the economy, the way they measure a GDP, will probably end up being a little bit above 2.5% for the year, which is about the same as we were getting.
[02:10:30.331 --> 02:10:35.196]  You know, a little bit better maybe than the average of the last four years under Obama.
[02:10:35.196 --> 02:10:37.379]  But there were years that Obama had higher than that.
[02:10:37.919 --> 02:10:50.564]  But the important thing is if you look at what's happening in the dollar, for example, last year was the first year in five years that the dollar went down, and it was the biggest decline in 14 years.
[02:10:50.564 --> 02:10:54.026]  We had the biggest drop against the Chinese Yuan in nine years.
[02:10:54.486 --> 02:10:59.810]  And in fact, I think this year we're going to fall to an all-time record low against the yuan.
[02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:06.715]  I think we're going to hit record lows against other major currencies like the euro and the yen maybe by 2019 or 2020.
[02:11:06.715 --> 02:11:07.836]  Look at the bond market.
[02:11:07.836 --> 02:11:10.498]  We're at about a four-year high now in 10-year treasuries.
[02:11:12.179 --> 02:11:13.740]  But bond prices are rising.
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:14.721]  Look at oil.
[02:11:14.721 --> 02:11:17.603]  Oil's now back at $63, $64 a barrel.
[02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:20.465]  We've had a huge increase, but we're just getting started.
[02:11:20.465 --> 02:11:22.106]  Gold is on the verge of breaking out.
[02:11:22.106 --> 02:11:23.427]  Hasn't really done it yet.
[02:11:23.427 --> 02:11:25.508]  We're still trading around $13.40.
[02:11:25.508 --> 02:11:33.294]  But what's happening is inflation is rearing its ugly head in a big way, and this is going to help push up interest rates.
[02:11:33.294 --> 02:11:36.216]  And what Trump has done, or the Republicans with these tax cuts,
[02:11:36.616 --> 02:11:43.623]  They're not going to help the economy because the economy has so many other headwinds that are going to hit it, but they are going to push up the deficit.
[02:11:43.623 --> 02:11:45.524]  The budget deficits are going to soar.
[02:11:45.524 --> 02:11:47.747]  The trade deficits are at record highs.
[02:11:47.747 --> 02:11:48.587]  They're going to soar.
[02:11:48.587 --> 02:11:54.173]  These rising twin deficits, increasing interest rates is reminiscent of 1987 before the market crashed.
[02:11:55.834 --> 02:11:59.536]  But the problem is we are more dependent now than we ever have been.
[02:11:59.536 --> 02:12:08.621]  The Federal Reserve made the mistake of creating a huge bubble economy that completely depends on extremely low interest rates to survive.
[02:12:08.621 --> 02:12:09.942]  Peter, let's come back to that in a moment.
[02:12:09.942 --> 02:12:10.902]  Let's come back in a moment.
[02:12:10.902 --> 02:12:15.285]  I agree with you on the fundamentals and you predicted a lot of things accurately before, but this is what I'm getting at.
[02:12:16.045 --> 02:12:25.591]  What was Trump supposed to do when they already had it planned to go down, admittedly, when Hillary got in and kind of organize our collapse and use that for social control?
[02:12:25.591 --> 02:12:37.219]  What is Trump supposed to do when he's trying to end globalist control, NTPP, stabilize the border, get people believing in humanity again, doing a lot of really good positive things to return sovereignty?
[02:12:37.219 --> 02:12:42.783]  He's using a bubble against their bubble, and I see a lot of these policies actually deploying money back to the people.
[02:12:42.783 --> 02:12:43.523]  The average family, $13,000.
[02:12:47.146 --> 02:12:49.387]  Alex, this is going to backfire.
[02:12:49.387 --> 02:12:52.008]  He's like the Jimmy Carter in reverse.
[02:12:52.008 --> 02:12:58.731]  I think we're going to have an extremely liberal president, either a Bernie Sanders or someone like him in 2020.
[02:12:58.731 --> 02:13:04.194]  What Trump should have done is leveled with the American people, like he kind of did when he was a candidate.
[02:13:04.194 --> 02:13:05.875]  He talked about how bad things were.
[02:13:06.175 --> 02:13:08.897]  But he didn't really say what needed to be done to fix it.
[02:13:08.897 --> 02:13:13.601]  But at least he said, we have a bubble in the stock market, you know, the economy is a mess.
[02:13:13.601 --> 02:13:16.423]  I mean, all that was true and that's why he got elected.
[02:13:16.423 --> 02:13:21.908]  But after he got elected, he became a cheerleader for the very economy that he correctly criticized.
[02:13:21.908 --> 02:13:23.449]  And now he has set everybody up.
[02:13:23.789 --> 02:13:31.535]  He has raised everybody's expectations so high that when everything comes crashing down, not only will he get blamed, but everyone's going to be disappointed.
[02:13:31.535 --> 02:13:36.638]  What he should have done, the moment he was sworn in, is he should have leveled with everybody and said, you know what?
[02:13:36.638 --> 02:13:37.779]  This is a disaster.
[02:13:37.779 --> 02:13:38.820]  It is a mess.
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:41.582]  I am going to fix this, but it's not going to be fun.
[02:13:41.582 --> 02:13:44.824]  The medicine that we're going to swallow right now is not going to taste good.
[02:13:44.824 --> 02:13:45.725]  But here's the problem.
[02:13:45.725 --> 02:13:51.269]  He knows the people were already demoralized by the globalists, by Obama, and all this other crud.
[02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:57.411]  You know, you're saying, oh, the economy's not really growing any faster, you know, than on Obama.
[02:13:57.411 --> 02:14:01.752]  Well, it does show 3.3%, and everybody I know is seeing a difference.
[02:14:01.752 --> 02:14:03.512]  Record low black unemployment.
[02:14:03.512 --> 02:14:13.975]  I mean, I think exuberance can bring us out of this and break the back of the globalists and show that they were the ones suppressing things, and then we can reorganize things.
[02:14:13.975 --> 02:14:22.637]  I agree, you're absolutely right about the Federal Reserve and all of it, but man, if he came in here and tanked the stock market with a reset like you're talking about, they
[02:14:22.637 --> 02:14:24.778]  He might really be able to impeach his butt.
[02:14:24.778 --> 02:14:25.318]  No.
[02:14:25.318 --> 02:14:27.539]  He campaigned and said it was a bubble.
[02:14:27.539 --> 02:14:28.659]  It wasn't his bubble.
[02:14:28.659 --> 02:14:29.560]  Now it's his bubble.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.560]  That's the problem.
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.442]  But if he would have said it's a bubble and it's going down, it wouldn't have been his fault.
[02:14:34.442 --> 02:14:38.883]  Because part of the cure for the economy is deflating these bubbles.
[02:14:38.883 --> 02:14:40.184]  It has to be done.
[02:14:40.184 --> 02:14:42.144]  Someone has to rip this band-aid off.
[02:14:42.144 --> 02:14:45.346]  And he was elected to do it.
[02:14:45.346 --> 02:14:46.446]  Isn't he doing that?
[02:14:46.446 --> 02:14:50.668]  Getting rid of the write-off for state income tax and for property tax?
[02:14:51.548 --> 02:14:53.469]  No, he's not coming close to doing that.
[02:14:53.469 --> 02:14:56.271]  These are gimmicking tax cuts that run up the deficit.
[02:14:56.271 --> 02:15:00.214]  They are not real tax cuts because we're not having cuts in government spending.
[02:15:00.214 --> 02:15:02.756]  You said we have record low black unemployment.
[02:15:02.756 --> 02:15:07.819]  Black unemployment was falling under Obama, too, because blacks were leaving the labor force.
[02:15:07.819 --> 02:15:08.840]  And that hasn't changed.
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:11.942]  You have record low labor force participation rate.
[02:15:11.942 --> 02:15:14.443]  Hardly any blacks are working, I mean, percentage-wise.
[02:15:14.443 --> 02:15:15.704]  So that's why they're not unemployed.
[02:15:15.704 --> 02:15:17.085]  Look how many are in prison.
[02:15:17.085 --> 02:15:18.926]  So this is not some kind of contract.
[02:15:18.926 --> 02:15:19.287]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:15:19.287 --> 02:15:21.328]  Black unemployment almost doubled under Obama.
[02:15:21.408 --> 02:15:21.578]  I think.
[02:15:23.513 --> 02:15:29.656]  No, the unemployment rate doubled for everybody at the beginning because, you know, and then it all, then it started to come down.
[02:15:29.656 --> 02:15:37.320]  But the reason it came down was because so many people left the labor force and so many people accepted crappy, low-paying, part-time jobs.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:38.381]  And that is what's going on.
[02:15:38.381 --> 02:15:39.841]  That hasn't changed under Trump.
[02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:45.564]  Alright, well listen, anybody accuses me of being a cheerleader for the economy, this is the balancing of it out.
[02:15:45.564 --> 02:15:48.746]  I hope Peter Schiff's wrong, he's a smart guy.
[02:15:48.746 --> 02:15:49.666]  What's gonna happen then?
[02:15:49.666 --> 02:15:50.827]  How will the implosion look?
[02:15:50.827 --> 02:15:52.388]  I mean, let's war game that when we come back.
[02:15:54.534 --> 02:15:56.475]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:56.475 --> 02:16:01.797]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:16:01.797 --> 02:16:03.378]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:16:03.378 --> 02:16:11.742]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:11.742 --> 02:16:17.425]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:16:17.605 --> 02:16:19.426]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:16:19.426 --> 02:16:21.668]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:16:21.668 --> 02:16:26.091]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:16:26.091 --> 02:16:28.293]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:19:34.525 --> 02:19:36.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:17.310 --> 02:20:21.692]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:21.692 --> 02:20:30.277]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:30.277 --> 02:20:32.198]  Alright, Peter Schiff is our guest.
[02:20:32.198 --> 02:20:34.159]  He's made a lot of accurate predictions over the years.
[02:20:35.438 --> 02:20:39.500]  But I want to positively say he's made some that didn't come true.
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:49.025]  I totally agree with what he's saying about a big bubble and, you know, the stock market mainly helping really wealthy people, except it makes them bring new jobs here, hire more folks, raise wages.
[02:20:49.025 --> 02:20:51.066]  We are seeing thousands of companies come back.
[02:20:51.066 --> 02:20:52.847]  I think we're seeing some positive things, but...
[02:20:53.467 --> 02:20:56.809]  He's basically up here saying that there's a giant bubble.
[02:20:56.809 --> 02:21:07.314]  Well, you just heard him earlier, if you were tuned in, that Trump's helped pump it up now and that he's going to be the fall guy when it implodes, discrediting capitalism and bringing in basically a communist.
[02:21:07.314 --> 02:21:08.895]  Is that what you're getting at, Mr. Schiff?
[02:21:08.895 --> 02:21:13.418]  A. And then B, how will the bubble go down in different scenarios?
[02:21:13.418 --> 02:21:16.159]  And how far will the market go down if your scenario is right?
[02:21:16.159 --> 02:21:20.522]  Because I'll be honest with you, it gets a little scary when the market's gaining a thousand points in a week.
[02:21:20.522 --> 02:21:22.883]  I mean, that does kind of get me a little concerned.
[02:21:23.697 --> 02:21:27.461]  Yeah, you know, this is the same thing that happened under George W. Bush, right?
[02:21:27.461 --> 02:21:28.843]  He inherited a bubble.
[02:21:28.843 --> 02:21:37.373]  Instead of leveling with the American public, he pretended everything was great, and then the bigger bubble that was inflated while he was president collapsed.
[02:21:37.373 --> 02:21:43.040]  Except that he got a second term, because his bubble didn't really pop until the end of his second term.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:49.224]  I think Trump's is going to pop during his first term because this one is much bigger and we don't have as much time.
[02:21:49.224 --> 02:21:51.666]  But here's how it's going to go down.
[02:21:51.666 --> 02:21:55.209]  So what's going to happen is interest rates are going to keep rising.
[02:21:55.209 --> 02:21:57.090]  Commodity prices are going to keep rising.
[02:21:57.090 --> 02:21:58.671]  The dollar is going to keep falling.
[02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:02.874]  So you're going to start to see pickups in the official inflation rate.
[02:22:02.874 --> 02:22:08.779]  And so rising consumer prices and rising interest rates are going to start to be a powerful headwind
[02:22:09.179 --> 02:22:23.903]  For the economy, because Americans are going to be spending a lot more money on basic necessities, if they have an adjustable rate mortgage, costs are going up, credit card debt, auto loans, all this cheap money is going to be gradually going away, and the economy is going to be weakening.
[02:22:23.903 --> 02:22:27.264]  And as the economy is weakening, unemployment is going to start to pick up.
[02:22:27.264 --> 02:22:28.444]  Now the Fed's going to see this.
[02:22:28.444 --> 02:22:33.986]  The Fed's going to see the economy slowing down, and if they continue to raise rates, it will go into recession.
[02:22:35.365 --> 02:22:37.427]  That is better than the alternative.
[02:22:37.427 --> 02:22:52.279]  But the alternative, if the Federal Reserve decides that they want to prevent a recession or maybe fight off a recession, if it happens and they don't recognize it in time, if they want to prop up the stock market, then what they have to do is call off the rate hikes.
[02:22:52.279 --> 02:22:54.541]  In fact, I think they have to go back to zero.
[02:22:54.541 --> 02:23:00.045]  They have to launch QE4 in order to keep interest rates from really spiking and to prop up the market.
[02:23:00.045 --> 02:23:02.087]  But that will set off a currency crisis.
[02:23:02.367 --> 02:23:12.351]  The dollar will plunge, not just make new lows, but destroy the old lows, and that will set off an economic crisis that's far worse than the financial crisis or the recession.
[02:23:12.351 --> 02:23:14.752]  Okay, well let me throw this at you then.
[02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:21.275]  They say China, some numbers, 5, 6, 7, 8 times the amount of state-sponsored pumping money into it.
[02:23:21.275 --> 02:23:23.596]  They execute you if you criticize the markets over there.
[02:23:24.356 --> 02:23:28.220]  China's going to lower their taxes to basically zero to incentivize companies to stay.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:34.226]  How can China's bubble just continue to go up and up and up and up and up when they've got all their problems?
[02:23:34.226 --> 02:23:36.529]  And then you're saying that our bubble isn't going to work.
[02:23:36.529 --> 02:23:45.098]  I mean, I really hope you're wrong because they've got news articles out there where they call the stock market and say, wow, why'd the market jump?
[02:23:45.098 --> 02:23:47.140]  Well, Jones came out and said, Comey admitted
[02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:49.662]  You know, Trump not under criminal investigation.
[02:23:49.662 --> 02:24:04.358]  Well, he really did say that, but I mean, I know this show actually affects markets, and I get it's all a house of cards, but good Lord, man, if they've got house of cards that are much, much bigger and out of control over in China, I'm just, I don't like trying to pull the house of cards down.
[02:24:05.479 --> 02:24:08.921]  Well, remember, China now has record trade surpluses.
[02:24:08.921 --> 02:24:10.222]  We have record deficits.
[02:24:10.222 --> 02:24:12.943]  The Chinese people save 30% of what they earn.
[02:24:12.943 --> 02:24:14.424]  We barely save 3%.
[02:24:14.424 --> 02:24:16.165]  Our savings rates at a 10-year low.
[02:24:16.165 --> 02:24:18.846]  The Chinese government isn't in debt.
[02:24:18.846 --> 02:24:19.727]  They have assets.
[02:24:19.727 --> 02:24:22.468]  They got trillions and trillions of dollars of assets.
[02:24:22.468 --> 02:24:23.389]  We have liabilities.
[02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:24.990]  They're the biggest owners of our debt, aren't they?
[02:24:25.987 --> 02:24:28.349]  They own our debt, but they own other debt.
[02:24:28.349 --> 02:24:35.693]  But they don't have Social Security, they don't have Medicare, they don't have all these unfunded liabilities the way we do.
[02:24:35.693 --> 02:24:37.335]  Chinese rely on themselves.
[02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.276]  Americans rely on the government.
[02:24:39.276 --> 02:24:41.017]  We have got a much bigger bubble.
[02:24:41.017 --> 02:24:42.958]  They actually have a vibrant economy.
[02:24:42.958 --> 02:24:54.226]  Yes, there are problems in that economy, but a lot of it has to do with their misguided efforts to prop up the dollar so they can keep selling Americans products that we can't afford and that we'll never pay for.
[02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:57.529]  I'm not being critical of this.
[02:24:57.529 --> 02:24:59.251]  I think investors should invest wherever they like.
[02:24:59.251 --> 02:25:01.393]  I know you're Euro-Pacific capital.
[02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:07.620]  I know you're all about investing all over the world, but are you betting on America having a downturn because you've got more foreign investments?
[02:25:08.678 --> 02:25:12.782]  I am, and actually, you know, a lot of our strategies have beaten the U.S.
[02:25:12.782 --> 02:25:23.972]  market over the last two years, despite the fact that it's gone up, and we're beating it again in a lot of strategies this year, because the dollar is so weak, that gives you a huge tailwind when now you're investing internationally.
[02:25:23.972 --> 02:25:26.435]  So, for all the years the dollar was strengthening,
[02:25:27.235 --> 02:25:30.537]  It was, you know, that was eating away at international returns.
[02:25:30.537 --> 02:25:34.078]  But the dollar is about to lose all of that strength, and then some.
[02:25:34.078 --> 02:25:38.340]  So now, if you're bullish on the stock market, there's no reason to be invested in the U.S.
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:38.940]  market.
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:43.302]  We're going to make so much more money, and we are making much more money in emerging markets, right?
[02:25:43.302 --> 02:25:47.704]  But in your modeling, lower dollar brings back more manufacturing jobs.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:48.920]  No, it doesn't.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:55.123]  The lower dollar is going to bring record high trade deficits because it's going to increase what we have to pay to import the things that we can't do.
[02:25:55.123 --> 02:26:04.367]  Peter, I've got to say though, man, I think betting against America, I just have a gut feeling that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:26:04.927 --> 02:26:06.349]  I'm not betting against America.
[02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:10.254]  I'm betting against the socialists and the central bankers who would destroy America.
[02:26:10.254 --> 02:26:12.817]  In the long run, maybe America is going to come back.
[02:26:12.817 --> 02:26:14.839]  But first, we're going to have to pay the piper.
[02:26:14.839 --> 02:26:16.361]  This is a gigantic bubble.
[02:26:16.361 --> 02:26:18.303]  Trump was right when he was a candidate.
[02:26:18.303 --> 02:26:19.505]  The air is coming out.
[02:26:19.505 --> 02:26:19.985]  No, I know.
[02:26:19.985 --> 02:26:21.647]  Trump sounded like he was a candidate.
[02:26:22.438 --> 02:26:26.479]  And then they got mad at him saying, you know, the real estate's too high, all this stuff hurts average families.
[02:26:26.479 --> 02:26:27.359]  You're right.
[02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:31.741]  But I'm just saying, being right intellectually is good.
[02:26:31.741 --> 02:26:34.161]  But, I mean, you're a successful, wealthy guy.
[02:26:34.161 --> 02:26:40.343]  The average family and hardworking people that are working two, three jobs, a collapse is going to, at least in the short term, hurt them bad.
[02:26:41.087 --> 02:26:42.468]  No, but it's going to happen now anyway.
[02:26:42.468 --> 02:26:43.368]  It's going to happen worse.
[02:26:43.368 --> 02:26:46.310]  When the dollar collapses, it wipes out the middle class.
[02:26:46.310 --> 02:26:47.951]  People are going to be impoverished.
[02:26:47.951 --> 02:26:49.151]  And they're going to blame Trump.
[02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:52.553]  You know, there are a lot of people who voted for Trump out of frustration.
[02:26:52.553 --> 02:26:53.594]  He promised a lot.
[02:26:53.594 --> 02:26:54.675]  He talked big.
[02:26:54.675 --> 02:26:56.295]  He is not going to deliver.
[02:26:56.295 --> 02:26:58.216]  And that is going to be used against him.
[02:26:58.216 --> 02:27:00.438]  And it's going to ultimately be used against the country.
[02:27:01.198 --> 02:27:01.598]  We're good to go.
[02:27:17.445 --> 02:27:18.865]  This is a disaster.
[02:27:18.865 --> 02:27:23.547]  We had a chance to defuse this if Trump would have owned up to the problems of the economy.
[02:27:23.547 --> 02:27:24.687]  They weren't his fault.
[02:27:24.687 --> 02:27:32.229]  He could have blamed it all on his predecessor and he could have finally put politics aside and done the right thing for this country.
[02:27:32.229 --> 02:27:37.690]  Instead he acted just like all the other presidents who have just, you know, continued to kick the can down the road.
[02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:44.012]  I don't think he acted like all of them on social issues, like marching with pro-life, nobody's done that.
[02:27:44.012 --> 02:27:48.013]  The border, the veterans, I mean, he's really delivering on a lot of fronts.
[02:27:48.013 --> 02:27:57.477]  No, no, I'm talking about big cuts to government spending, dealing with entitlements, getting in and cutting Social Security and Medicare so we don't have massive... No, no, I agree, that's got to start.
[02:27:57.477 --> 02:27:58.437]  There's been some cutting.
[02:27:59.158 --> 02:28:00.719]  No, there hasn't been.
[02:28:00.719 --> 02:28:05.481]  Government spending is growing under Trump.
[02:28:05.481 --> 02:28:06.741]  They're not cutting anything.
[02:28:06.741 --> 02:28:11.263]  They're increasing spending and they're reducing revenues to finance that spending.
[02:28:11.263 --> 02:28:15.725]  That means the government is going to rely on inflation and debt to finance even more.
[02:28:15.725 --> 02:28:15.845]  Sure.
[02:28:15.845 --> 02:28:19.127]  Yeah, but models show these type of tax cuts a lot of times bring in higher tax receipts.
[02:28:19.887 --> 02:28:21.027]  They're not going to do that.
[02:28:21.027 --> 02:28:23.008]  They never do that.
[02:28:23.008 --> 02:28:28.510]  The tax receipts won't be enough to cover the decline, but meanwhile the economy is going to fall.
[02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:35.633]  Higher interest rates and higher consumer prices, which are a consequence of the tax cuts, are going to be a bigger drag on the economy.
[02:28:35.633 --> 02:28:38.494]  We've got to have you back up soon to really flesh this out.
[02:28:38.494 --> 02:28:42.356]  Man, I feel like jumping off a cliff now.
[02:28:42.356 --> 02:28:43.817]  Seriously, I'll never commit suicide.
[02:28:43.817 --> 02:28:44.737]  Hillary, don't get me.
[02:28:44.737 --> 02:28:45.757]  I was just joking.
[02:28:45.757 --> 02:28:46.738]  All right, Peter Schiff.
[02:28:47.979 --> 02:28:51.680]  If he's right, it'll be a great time for investors to buy stuff up.
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:52.700]  Like the Communist Chinese.
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:54.200]  We'll be back.

[02:29:55.117 --> 02:30:15.089]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:30:15.089 --> 02:30:17.211]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[02:30:21.193 --> 02:30:22.234]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[02:30:38.765 --> 02:30:47.951]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:30:47.951 --> 02:30:52.394]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:30:56.867 --> 02:31:15.271]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:31:15.271 --> 02:31:21.552]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:31:21.552 --> 02:31:22.672]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:31:22.672 --> 02:31:25.493]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[02:31:26.153 --> 02:31:27.693]  And so much more.
[02:31:27.693 --> 02:31:29.054]  It is concentrated.
[02:31:29.054 --> 02:31:30.774]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:31:30.774 --> 02:31:36.575]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:31:36.575 --> 02:31:37.795]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:31:37.795 --> 02:31:39.816]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:31:39.816 --> 02:31:42.396]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:31:42.396 --> 02:31:43.836]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:31:43.836 --> 02:31:46.197]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:46.917]  Immune Wall.
[02:31:46.917 --> 02:31:48.357]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:48.357 --> 02:31:49.517]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:54.696 --> 02:31:56.578]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:56.578 --> 02:31:57.819]  Go ahead.
[02:31:57.819 --> 02:31:59.740]  Oh Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:09.128]  Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:32:09.927 --> 02:32:16.709]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:32:16.709 --> 02:32:18.949]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:32:18.949 --> 02:32:20.010]  Thank you.
[02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:22.510]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:26.831]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:32:26.831 --> 02:32:29.852]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:32:29.852 --> 02:32:31.153]  They are quality.
[02:32:31.153 --> 02:32:32.893]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:32:32.893 --> 02:32:35.774]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:32:35.774 --> 02:32:36.314]  Absolutely.
[02:32:36.534 --> 02:32:58.142]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:58.142 --> 02:33:00.803]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.018 --> 02:33:10.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:18.506]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:18.506 --> 02:33:22.329]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:22.329 --> 02:33:26.392]  Next year's news today.
[02:33:26.392 --> 02:33:28.013]  I'm quite honest about this.
[02:33:28.013 --> 02:33:28.814]  I like Roger Stone.
[02:33:28.814 --> 02:33:29.934]  I've known him about three years.
[02:33:29.934 --> 02:33:31.796]  I met him at a JFK event like seven years ago.
[02:33:33.277 --> 02:33:34.898]  No, no, he is for over a decade.
[02:33:34.898 --> 02:33:42.920]  He's a best-selling author, a whole bunch of best-selling books, but I knew he worked in a bunch of administrations, but this is not a butt-kissing operation.
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:51.624]  When listeners think that I'm talking about how we're tomorrow's news today to just keep tooting our horn, the globalists want to control narratives.
[02:33:51.624 --> 02:33:53.364]  They know what's really going on.
[02:33:53.364 --> 02:33:57.746]  It's not that hard once you get studied and get your mind in the game to know what's really going on.
[02:33:57.746 --> 02:34:00.787]  They just don't want anybody saying it so they can keep people in the dark.
[02:34:03.268 --> 02:34:12.853]  But we have our listeners, we have our guests, we have our crew, all of us together, our private intelligence network, promoting Americana and freedom.
[02:34:12.853 --> 02:34:25.019]  And you heard Peter Schiff earlier about this big bubble we're in, and oh, this and that, and he's heavily invested in China, which is fine, and you know, he thinks that that's gonna beat the American economy, and he'd like America to reform, I get it.
[02:34:25.019 --> 02:34:27.680]  But Trump is delivering in this bubble
[02:34:28.894 --> 02:34:32.895]  Real incentives, real jobs, real build-up in this country.
[02:34:32.895 --> 02:34:46.679]  And culturally, he's not allowing them to censor, he's trying to block them, he's promoting pro-life, he's promoting taking care of the veterans, sovereignty, tax cuts for families, like Putin's done so people have more kids.
[02:34:46.679 --> 02:34:48.440]  I really don't see any fault in this man.
[02:34:50.157 --> 02:34:54.500]  And everybody wants to kill him or destroy him because they're playing along with it.
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:58.423]  And it's easy to take the middle road because things are so volatile.
[02:34:58.423 --> 02:34:59.904]  I'm betting on America.
[02:34:59.904 --> 02:35:02.326]  I'm betting on Trump.
[02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:08.651]  And I'm not going to let him break my will, especially not now that he did that pro-life march that no Republican would ever do.
[02:35:08.651 --> 02:35:14.415]  And called for the states to take control of the situation, which is constitutional, and for an end to partial birth abortion.
[02:35:14.415 --> 02:35:15.636]  The other presidents don't do that.
[02:35:15.636 --> 02:35:16.857]  The other Republicans don't.
[02:35:16.857 --> 02:35:19.219]  We are breaking their back.
[02:35:20.626 --> 02:35:24.669]  So the money is a side issue.
[02:35:24.669 --> 02:35:27.912]  And it is all crazy town.
[02:35:27.912 --> 02:35:33.216]  But I look at what Trump's doing, he's taking this mess and trying to get stuff to the people.
[02:35:33.216 --> 02:35:36.879]  And trying to make it cool to have a job and work and be honorable.
[02:35:36.879 --> 02:35:41.703]  Now that said, that's where I stand.
[02:35:41.703 --> 02:35:44.765]  And so I'm just gonna continue to even support more.
[02:35:44.765 --> 02:35:46.867]  Now, getting back to Roger Stone.
[02:35:46.867 --> 02:35:48.589]  Roger Stone, we looked it up in
[02:35:49.662 --> 02:35:57.207]  January, in February, in March, in April, in May, in June, until the point I said, stop it!
[02:35:57.207 --> 02:35:57.627]  Shed.
[02:35:57.627 --> 02:36:07.114]  The key is the illegal getting of the FISA warrant, the fake dossier, the targeting, them lying about it, perjuring to Congress, Comey saying Trump is crazy, quote, insane.
[02:36:07.114 --> 02:36:08.315]  The key is that.
[02:36:08.315 --> 02:36:15.780]  We have them open and shut beyond Nick Sonian, who we work for, the only member of the so-called plumbers to not go to jail because he wasn't involved.
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:17.061]  The point is, is that
[02:36:19.008 --> 02:36:33.952]  That Roger is absolutely the person that broke this, all of this, and now Congress, Jim Jordan, Gates, and I know Roger helped get elected, is saying they've seen it, Obama ran it, devastating, they're going to prison.
[02:36:33.952 --> 02:36:44.495]  They said major officials are going to prison because they're so dumb, like the memos reportedly have them going, we can't let him get in, he's bad, let's make stuff up, we need an insurance policy.
[02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:46.616]  It's the President saying it!
[02:36:47.336 --> 02:36:48.577]  And Rice and all them.
[02:36:48.577 --> 02:36:53.241]  So Stone, you have been absolutely on target like nobody else I know.
[02:36:53.241 --> 02:36:54.462]  It's just true.
[02:36:54.462 --> 02:36:54.863]  It's true.
[02:36:54.863 --> 02:36:59.467]  I mean, I really respected you before, but it's getting crazy how accurate we are.
[02:36:59.467 --> 02:37:07.213]  Without getting into sources and things, because obviously you didn't just pull this out of your rear end, you have advised the President the whole time, this is the proper course.
[02:37:07.213 --> 02:37:08.594]  So what's the next shoe to drop?
[02:37:08.594 --> 02:37:12.698]  Because, I mean, this is amazing, the crimes they've committed.
[02:37:14.028 --> 02:37:19.790]  Well, Alex, it's the biggest abuse of power that we've ever seen in American history by any president.
[02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:23.192]  It makes what happened in Watergate pale in comparison.
[02:37:23.192 --> 02:37:40.419]  Essentially, Barack Obama, working with the Clintons, doctored up a phony dossier to use it as a rationale to convince the FISA court to issue warrants to conduct political espionage on the Republican candidate for president and his campaign.
[02:37:41.138 --> 02:37:45.162]  That is a constitutional crisis like we have never had.
[02:37:45.162 --> 02:37:47.224]  And now they are busted.
[02:37:47.224 --> 02:37:48.565]  Red handed.
[02:37:48.565 --> 02:37:55.232]  Back when Circa News first reported that 30,000 Americans were illegally under surveillance.
[02:37:55.948 --> 02:38:04.814]  And the court had even admonished the NSA not to do it, that it violated the Fourth Amendment, and they did it anyway.
[02:38:04.814 --> 02:38:10.237]  The great lesson of Watergate, as you know, Alex, is no person is above the law.
[02:38:10.237 --> 02:38:11.378]  Well, we're about to find out.
[02:38:12.483 --> 02:38:15.184]  Mr. Clapper, Mr. Brennan, Ms.
[02:38:15.184 --> 02:38:20.626]  Rice, Valerie Jarrett, this list goes on and on of the co-conspirators.
[02:38:20.626 --> 02:38:22.226]  They need to see jail time.
[02:38:22.226 --> 02:38:24.347]  Our Constitution isn't some joke.
[02:38:24.347 --> 02:38:30.349]  We are a nation of laws and they cheated to try to steal an election.
[02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:31.089]  That's right.
[02:38:31.089 --> 02:38:32.910]  I know some of it was sources.
[02:38:34.292 --> 02:38:38.716]  The president obviously never told you classified information, but once he got in he knew he was being spied on.
[02:38:38.716 --> 02:38:39.757]  He even said that.
[02:38:39.757 --> 02:38:51.768]  The boldness of them on CNN, on MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, you and I by name, I already played the clips twice today, I'm not going to play them again, saying Jones and Stone are liars.
[02:38:51.768 --> 02:38:53.890]  They're the source to the president they were being spied on.
[02:38:53.890 --> 02:38:54.511]  No!
[02:38:54.511 --> 02:38:57.394]  They said when he was president-elect they were spying on him.
[02:38:57.694 --> 02:39:01.016]  Then they pulled that back and said they weren't, and then acted like they never said it.
[02:39:01.016 --> 02:39:05.559]  I mean, the level of lying in plain view is crazy!
[02:39:05.559 --> 02:39:12.484]  No, I remember when they asked Clapper about this under oath, he started to tell them and say, well, it's too sensitive, I can't talk about it.
[02:39:12.484 --> 02:39:14.886]  Of course, that's why we have congressional hearings.
[02:39:14.886 --> 02:39:17.508]  They are so busted, Alex.
[02:39:17.508 --> 02:39:23.312]  And the arrogance of it all revived around the fact that since Hillary was going to surely win,
[02:39:23.992 --> 02:39:26.453]  There'd be no exposure on their emails.
[02:39:26.453 --> 02:39:27.594]  That was the arrogance.
[02:39:27.594 --> 02:39:28.794]  They were sure.
[02:39:28.794 --> 02:39:29.194]  Where is it?
[02:39:29.194 --> 02:39:30.175]  I've got it around here.
[02:39:30.175 --> 02:39:31.115]  Where's my Madam President?
[02:39:31.115 --> 02:39:32.516]  I guess they already hung it back up.
[02:39:32.516 --> 02:39:40.119]  They were so sure of the Madam President that why not just do whatever they want and run roughshod because they were planning to shut down the press, arrest everybody.
[02:39:40.119 --> 02:39:44.361]  I mean, they told folks they were coming after us as soon as they got in.
[02:39:44.361 --> 02:39:45.882]  They were going to go full authoritarian.
[02:39:45.882 --> 02:39:46.322]  Oh, there it is.
[02:39:46.322 --> 02:39:47.303]  I didn't see it there.
[02:39:47.303 --> 02:39:50.464]  They were going to go full authoritarian, but it didn't work, did it?
[02:39:50.464 --> 02:39:52.245]  I mean, this is epic.
[02:39:53.970 --> 02:39:56.832]  And the dissembling.
[02:39:56.832 --> 02:40:02.617]  Look at the USA Today headline that says, Trump claim of wiretapping debunked.
[02:40:02.617 --> 02:40:03.998]  No, no it wasn't debunked.
[02:40:03.998 --> 02:40:10.042]  In fact, Judge Andrew Napolitano was right on the money when he said that Trump had been spied on.
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:14.281]  So it is amazing how the worm has turned.
[02:40:14.281 --> 02:40:25.025]  And I think in all honesty, huge credit has to go to Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Matt Gaetz, Congressman DeSantis.
[02:40:25.025 --> 02:40:27.306]  These guys have done a great job.
[02:40:27.306 --> 02:40:34.869]  They have been dogged while the country club Republicans were too busy at their cocktail parties talking about how embarrassing Donald Trump is.
[02:40:35.249 --> 02:40:41.890]  These guys understood their constitutional duty as members and they have, and trade unions should be added as well.
[02:40:41.890 --> 02:40:42.310]  That's right.
[02:40:42.310 --> 02:40:45.171]  They were not sunshine patriots.
[02:40:45.171 --> 02:40:46.751]  No, they were, they were fighters.
[02:40:46.751 --> 02:40:48.632]  They know why they got to Congress.
[02:40:48.632 --> 02:40:53.553]  They didn't get to Washington and get lost in the system and decide that it's go along to get along.
[02:40:53.553 --> 02:40:54.933]  They weren't afraid to make waves.
[02:40:54.933 --> 02:40:57.393]  I think huge credit's got to go to those guys.
[02:40:57.393 --> 02:40:58.414]  And Nunes too.
[02:40:58.414 --> 02:40:59.914]  All of them are presidential material now.
[02:41:01.228 --> 02:41:07.131]  But at the same time, someone needs to examine Adam Schiff, because he appears to be part of a cover-up.
[02:41:07.131 --> 02:41:13.634]  How is it that every Democrat on the Intelligence Committee voted against the release of these materials?
[02:41:13.634 --> 02:41:20.537]  How is it that no Democratic member of the House has bothered to go to a special room that they've set up where you can examine those documents?
[02:41:20.537 --> 02:41:23.058]  By the way, that's the next question.
[02:41:23.058 --> 02:41:25.940]  Nunes, Jordan, they're all trying to get it released.
[02:41:27.250 --> 02:41:28.051]  Just release it.
[02:41:28.051 --> 02:41:32.074]  I mean, you know, what's the word on what's in that file?
[02:41:32.074 --> 02:41:43.303]  Well, what we know, Alex, is that they went to the FISA court in July asking for the surveillance of Trump and his team, myself included.
[02:41:43.303 --> 02:41:47.067]  And they were shocked when the judge said no.
[02:41:47.067 --> 02:41:49.168]  Then they came back several months later.
[02:41:49.168 --> 02:41:53.952]  They didn't tell a different judge that the court had already denied this.
[02:41:53.952 --> 02:41:54.593]  That's the key.
[02:41:55.288 --> 02:41:57.949]  And they buffaloed him into approving it.
[02:41:57.949 --> 02:42:02.390]  And then they were actually laughing about how dumb the judge was afterwards.
[02:42:02.390 --> 02:42:12.512]  So it's the connecting of the dots between the phony dossier and the government funding of that after it passed from Republican hands.
[02:42:12.512 --> 02:42:17.253]  It's the organized criminality of what they did there, paying for it, lying to Congress.
[02:42:17.253 --> 02:42:20.714]  Comey and all of them said that they weren't involved and said it was insane.
[02:42:20.714 --> 02:42:22.294]  I mean, there's that whole other area.
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:29.383]  Yeah, you've got, you've had perjury in front of the Congress most definitely on the part of Comey extensively.
[02:42:29.383 --> 02:42:37.286]  He sat in the same seat that I sat in in front of the House Intelligence Committee and he lied his derriere off.
[02:42:37.286 --> 02:42:41.287]  But it's okay, he's about to teach a course on ethics.
[02:42:41.287 --> 02:42:44.869]  Yeah, from prison.
[02:42:44.869 --> 02:42:47.530]  Seriously, let's talk about when is this going to come out and what does it say?
[02:42:47.530 --> 02:42:49.471]  The word is it's got Obama on it.
[02:42:49.471 --> 02:42:52.072]  Obama actually basically ordered the judge to do it.
[02:42:52.072 --> 02:42:52.692]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.949 --> 02:42:59.653]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:43:54.022 --> 02:43:57.443]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:43:57.443 --> 02:44:01.405]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:44:01.405 --> 02:44:04.746]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:44:04.746 --> 02:44:07.287]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:44:07.287 --> 02:44:11.629]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:44:12.009 --> 02:44:21.372]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:44:21.372 --> 02:44:28.535]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:44:29.555 --> 02:44:34.617]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:44:34.617 --> 02:44:42.259]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:44:42.259 --> 02:44:47.161]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[02:44:47.161 --> 02:44:49.462]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:44:55.295 --> 02:44:56.715]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:56.715 --> 02:44:58.076]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:58.076 --> 02:44:59.276]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:59.276 --> 02:45:04.557]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:04.557 --> 02:45:18.100]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:19.460]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:45:20.380 --> 02:45:21.901]  Spreading disease around.
[02:45:21.901 --> 02:45:24.462]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:24.462 --> 02:45:25.783]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.783 --> 02:45:26.884]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:45:26.884 --> 02:45:28.224]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:28.224 --> 02:45:32.707]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:32.707 --> 02:45:35.888]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:35.888 --> 02:45:39.050]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:40.111]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:45:40.111 --> 02:45:40.931]  Living Defense.
[02:45:40.931 --> 02:45:42.032]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:43.072]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:45:43.072 --> 02:45:45.093]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:45:46.635 --> 02:45:47.678]  You support the broadcast.
[02:45:47.678 --> 02:45:49.022]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:45:49.022 --> 02:45:51.269]  Thank you, Dr. Groot from the Global Healing Center.
[02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:53.235]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:45:55.703 --> 02:45:57.364]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:45:57.364 --> 02:45:58.305]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[02:45:58.305 --> 02:46:12.913]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:46:12.913 --> 02:46:19.437]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely
[02:46:19.557 --> 02:46:20.498]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:46:20.498 --> 02:46:21.018]  Well, thank you.
[02:46:21.018 --> 02:46:25.923]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but instead it says Won't Tread on Me.
[02:46:25.923 --> 02:46:28.885]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:46:28.885 --> 02:46:32.168]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:46:32.168 --> 02:46:38.413]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:46:38.413 --> 02:46:40.675]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:46:41.556 --> 02:46:48.425]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:46:48.425 --> 02:46:57.676]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:57.676 --> 02:47:00.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.031 --> 02:47:20.772]  Well, talking to Roger Stone, he just got invited to speak to the Oxford Union.
[02:47:20.772 --> 02:47:23.133]  I was invited to speak to that.
[02:47:23.133 --> 02:47:26.674]  I was in the middle of a contentious divorce, so I just couldn't go.
[02:47:26.674 --> 02:47:27.154]  I couldn't do it.
[02:47:27.154 --> 02:47:28.435]  I had to be with my children.
[02:47:28.435 --> 02:47:30.435]  But I do want to probably re-accept that.
[02:47:30.435 --> 02:47:35.957]  Of course, there was other invitations that were accompanying that were more secretive.
[02:47:35.957 --> 02:47:37.517]  And then Cambridge invited me right after.
[02:47:37.517 --> 02:47:39.078]  That's kind of two warring factions.
[02:47:39.078 --> 02:47:42.039]  A little bit of the whole...
[02:47:43.996 --> 02:47:46.578]  Underground stuff that goes on that I'm not involved in.
[02:47:46.578 --> 02:47:49.200]  That's another reason I've not gotten involved in at all.
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:50.701]  There's a lot of old secret societies.
[02:47:50.701 --> 02:47:51.402]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:47:51.402 --> 02:47:55.025]  But Roger Stone joins us right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:58.032 --> 02:48:01.873]  Just recapping the bombshell news that I want to get into.
[02:48:01.873 --> 02:48:15.857]  Why in heavens would Trump agree, as they're saying he is, to meet with Mueller unless it's to chew him out and interrogate him about how he got a Justice Department waiver to be in business with the Russians and to chew him out about how he colluded with Hillary?
[02:48:15.857 --> 02:48:17.998]  I mean, I wouldn't answer any of his questions.
[02:48:17.998 --> 02:48:21.939]  If it's to dress him down and maybe videotape it, then I would do it.
[02:48:21.939 --> 02:48:24.260]  Why in Hades would Trump meet with him?
[02:48:25.475 --> 02:48:30.760]  You know, Alex, I had dinner with our mutual friend, Judge Andrew Napolitano, the other night, and he put it best.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.242]  This is a perjury trap.
[02:48:33.242 --> 02:48:40.428]  The president would have to have a death wish to walk into such a one-sided inquiry.
[02:48:40.428 --> 02:48:41.629]  It's almost suicidal.
[02:48:42.453 --> 02:48:49.195]  I don't understand why the President, his lawyers said they're now negotiating over his testimony.
[02:48:49.195 --> 02:48:51.876]  I'm praying that he will change his mind.
[02:48:51.876 --> 02:48:53.457]  It's just not in his interest.
[02:48:53.457 --> 02:49:07.041]  But what it proves, once again, is that having run the whole gamut on Russian collusion and found nothing, we're back to the firing of Comey again as the pretext for Trump's impeachment.
[02:49:07.641 --> 02:49:10.843]  Oh, he obstructed justice or he perjured himself.
[02:49:10.843 --> 02:49:13.184]  Well, don't give it to them, Mr. President.
[02:49:13.184 --> 02:49:15.806]  They need you to incriminate yourself.
[02:49:15.806 --> 02:49:20.508]  That's what they're going to try to trick you into doing, saying something that they can twist.
[02:49:20.508 --> 02:49:22.910]  I am praying that the president changes his mind.
[02:49:23.646 --> 02:49:26.768]  Well, he just knows he hasn't done anything, so he thinks, why not?
[02:49:26.768 --> 02:49:27.809]  They'll make something up.
[02:49:27.809 --> 02:49:29.230]  He's got to videotape the whole thing.
[02:49:29.230 --> 02:49:32.372]  I mean, Comey made up memos, said he didn't perjure himself.
[02:49:32.372 --> 02:49:36.055]  This is a group created by Clinton's people, by Rosenstein.
[02:49:36.055 --> 02:49:36.716]  It's a joke.
[02:49:36.716 --> 02:49:37.676]  They should all be arrested.
[02:49:37.676 --> 02:49:39.157]  And that's my next question.
[02:49:39.157 --> 02:49:46.603]  What is the next shoe to drop with Jordan and Gates and all of them saying, next is criminal charges for high-level officials?
[02:49:46.603 --> 02:49:47.844]  I know we don't like to have
[02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:51.461]  Internal stuff like this, it could trigger a civil war.
[02:49:51.461 --> 02:49:53.841]  The Democrats are already pushing a civil war.
[02:49:53.841 --> 02:49:56.762]  I mean, we have to smash these criminals down.
[02:49:56.762 --> 02:49:59.443]  And I know it's dangerous to go up against these thugs and say that on air.
[02:49:59.443 --> 02:50:01.084]  Whatever, somebody's got to do it.
[02:50:01.084 --> 02:50:02.604]  They'll never going to go away.
[02:50:02.604 --> 02:50:09.946]  You don't have Hitler start World War II, and then in 1945, when you're closing in on Berlin, let him go ahead and stay in Berlin.
[02:50:09.946 --> 02:50:11.967]  You know he's going to reconstitute and attack again.
[02:50:11.967 --> 02:50:12.767]  You've got to get him.
[02:50:14.031 --> 02:50:22.496]  Well, what I learned yesterday, Alex, is that Rod Rosenstein, the de facto Attorney General of this country, left a time bomb.
[02:50:22.496 --> 02:50:29.601]  They had the President sign a document that changed the order of succession, the order of authority at the Justice Department.
[02:50:29.601 --> 02:50:38.767]  So, in other words, if the President ordered Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel in Uranium One, and he declined, he would need to resign.
[02:50:39.227 --> 02:50:40.909]  It would then go to Rosenstein.
[02:50:40.909 --> 02:50:50.300]  Well, that's a dead letter, but if the President fired Rosenstein, it now doesn't go to the Solicitor General, as it did under Nixon in the Archibald Cox filing.
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:54.926]  It goes to a woman named Nancy Brands, a deep stater, a Bushite.
[02:50:56.207 --> 02:50:57.989]  Then it goes to another Bushite.
[02:50:57.989 --> 02:50:59.830]  Then it goes to another Bushite.
[02:50:59.830 --> 02:51:02.873]  The President would have to get six deep in his own administration.
[02:51:02.873 --> 02:51:07.997]  So they're preparing shark teeth of BS to just continually work against him and the country.
[02:51:07.997 --> 02:51:10.399]  Well then what does he do about a manifest fraud like that?
[02:51:10.399 --> 02:51:14.783]  I mean this organized Clinton cabal that's still involved in mutinous hijacking.
[02:51:15.748 --> 02:51:20.573]  Well, I would fire Jeff Sessions immediately, and I'd get myself a fighting Attorney General.
[02:51:20.573 --> 02:51:22.435]  Let's be clear, Sessions did this.
[02:51:22.435 --> 02:51:26.119]  Sessions just enabled the Clintonoids to stay in power.
[02:51:26.119 --> 02:51:32.345]  Yeah, basically, I'm sure they said, we're making some structural changes at the Justice Department, Mr. President.
[02:51:32.345 --> 02:51:32.966]  Just sign this.
[02:51:33.567 --> 02:51:34.588]  It's unimportant.
[02:51:34.588 --> 02:51:35.710]  It's just unimportant.
[02:51:35.710 --> 02:51:37.412]  And they go, by the way, McCabe's your best friend.
[02:51:37.412 --> 02:51:40.096]  He's real reasonable when he led the cabal against you.
[02:51:40.096 --> 02:51:41.959]  I mean, exactly.
[02:51:41.959 --> 02:51:43.481]  It's like, McCabe likes you, sir.
[02:51:43.481 --> 02:51:44.122]  He's very fair.
[02:51:44.122 --> 02:51:46.346]  And then McCabe's leading the cabal against you.
[02:51:46.346 --> 02:51:46.947]  They don't tell him that.
[02:51:47.631 --> 02:51:53.555]  It's time for 5am raids at their apartments to seize their computer records.
[02:51:53.555 --> 02:52:00.179]  Mueller, Comey, McCabe, and Rosenstein all need government visits from the FBI.
[02:52:00.179 --> 02:52:04.282]  There's very honest men and women who work at the agency at the lower levels.
[02:52:04.702 --> 02:52:06.424]  The rotten crowd is at the top.
[02:52:06.424 --> 02:52:09.126]  This place needs a house cleaning desperately.
[02:52:09.126 --> 02:52:12.469]  Well, I know you and Dr. Jerome Coursey have amazing FBI contacts.
[02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:16.352]  You helped round up in the 80s a big Russian network and everything else.
[02:52:16.352 --> 02:52:18.594]  You were working for Nixon and all these other anti-communists.
[02:52:18.594 --> 02:52:19.955]  You're well known for that.
[02:52:19.955 --> 02:52:21.236]  You know a lot of FBI agents.
[02:52:21.236 --> 02:52:24.359]  What is the word from them on what's happening and going on?
[02:52:25.592 --> 02:52:26.873]  Well, now they're cheering.
[02:52:26.873 --> 02:52:30.794]  Most of the agents that I know were dejected during this election.
[02:52:30.794 --> 02:52:33.396]  They knew exactly what was going on, and they hated it.
[02:52:33.396 --> 02:52:38.178]  But they're company men, and they're mid-level and low-level men and women.
[02:52:38.178 --> 02:52:42.980]  Now, many of them are very pleased to see Peter Stroke and his lover,
[02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:44.701]  Well, that's my next question.
[02:53:01.209 --> 02:53:02.269]  Who's going to go to prison?
[02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:06.510]  Because you don't usually hear these congressmen and women saying, folks are going to prison.
[02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:13.472]  The stuff in this memo is 50 times worse is what they're saying than what was in the emails and texts where they're like, let's frame the president.
[02:53:13.472 --> 02:53:15.352]  I mean, that's incredible proof right there.
[02:53:15.352 --> 02:53:17.613]  This is way worse and just insane.
[02:53:17.613 --> 02:53:19.333]  They're saying, what's the word?
[02:53:19.333 --> 02:53:20.174]  Do you have any intel?
[02:53:20.174 --> 02:53:21.734]  And who's going to get indicted?
[02:53:22.754 --> 02:53:27.404]  I think the key thing for people to understand is this is the use of the U.S.
[02:53:27.404 --> 02:53:32.897]  government's authority and power for purposes of partisan political espionage.
[02:53:33.686 --> 02:53:36.707]  Ten times worse than what happened in Watergate.
[02:53:36.707 --> 02:53:39.668]  And I have to believe that this goes all the way to Obama.
[02:53:39.668 --> 02:53:48.692]  There's no way that the Obama NSA was wiretapping Americans, surveilling Americans, without the authority of Obama himself.
[02:53:48.692 --> 02:53:50.593]  Which means Valerie Jarrett knew.
[02:53:50.593 --> 02:53:52.914]  Which means Susan Rice knew.
[02:53:52.914 --> 02:53:55.195]  Brandon Clapper, right on down the line.
[02:53:55.535 --> 02:54:02.902]  This entire nest of criminals needs to be indicted, convicted, tried, and sent away.
[02:54:02.902 --> 02:54:04.263]  We are a nation of laws.
[02:54:04.263 --> 02:54:08.647]  Let me remind you liberals once again, no person is above the law.
[02:54:08.647 --> 02:54:09.308]  Sound familiar?
[02:54:11.274 --> 02:54:15.237]  You're going to host about 20 minutes to the next hour, then Leanne Mackett is going to be riding the shotgun with you.
[02:54:15.237 --> 02:54:19.200]  So we'll be right back to Roger Stone in the fourth hour.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:22.462]  I've got a bunch of emergency issues to deal with.
[02:54:22.462 --> 02:54:24.664]  Some good, some bad, and some very ugly.
[02:54:24.664 --> 02:54:30.849]  So I will not be hosting the fourth hour, and Roger's got big news that he is about to be on top of as well.
[02:54:30.849 --> 02:54:32.750]  So more with Roger Stone coming up in a few minutes.
[02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:36.033]  Remember, they are working around the clock.
[02:54:37.813 --> 02:54:42.877]  They are working around the clock to block us, shut us down, you name it.
[02:54:42.877 --> 02:54:43.737]  Okay?
[02:54:43.737 --> 02:54:47.860]  And when the history books are written, we'll tell you about the behind-the-scenes stuff, but we can't do that, obviously.
[02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:50.482]  Because the enemy's watching and it helps them.
[02:54:50.482 --> 02:54:54.004]  Just know this, we need your prayers, we need your support, we need everything.
[02:54:54.004 --> 02:54:57.106]  Roger Stone's going to come back in two and a half minutes after this break.
[02:54:57.106 --> 02:54:59.708]  Before I go any further, I hardly even plug.
[02:54:59.708 --> 02:55:01.089]  I didn't even plug in the first hour.
[02:55:01.089 --> 02:55:02.070]  That's my fault.
[02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:03.571]  If I plug enough, we can fund ourselves.
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:08.361]  I get so obsessed with the info, I'll skip breaks, you name it.
[02:55:08.361 --> 02:55:11.722]  I just need you to go, hey, Alex has delivered.
[02:55:11.722 --> 02:55:12.782]  He's standing up.
[02:55:12.782 --> 02:55:13.643]  He's under attack.
[02:55:13.643 --> 02:55:14.343]  He's fighting for us.
[02:55:14.343 --> 02:55:15.363]  We're fighting for him.
[02:55:15.363 --> 02:55:16.504]  He's got great supplements.
[02:55:16.504 --> 02:55:22.826]  He's got great non-GMO heirloom seeds and water filters and books and videos and t-shirts and you name it.
[02:55:22.826 --> 02:55:29.808]  Let's go spend some time, economically, getting great products at great prices and supporting the info war.
[02:55:30.984 --> 02:55:34.668]  We got a big nut to crack because I understand equilibrium.
[02:55:34.668 --> 02:55:36.891]  We're not going to stay the same.
[02:55:36.891 --> 02:55:38.833]  We're going to either shrink or get bigger.
[02:55:38.833 --> 02:55:41.036]  And if we shrink, we'll be destroyed.
[02:55:41.036 --> 02:55:42.998]  I need to surge this year.
[02:55:42.998 --> 02:55:49.045]  That means I've already told my wife I'm going to have to start working 18 hours a day again, no matter what it does to my body.
[02:55:49.045 --> 02:55:51.028]  And even though I love my children more than anything,
[02:55:52.133 --> 02:55:53.594]  At least week on, week off.
[02:55:53.594 --> 02:55:58.378]  When my children, one week on and off with my ex-wife, some of them, I'm gonna work 18 hours a day.
[02:55:58.378 --> 02:56:01.741]  I'm gonna work 12 hours a day the other times when they're home.
[02:56:01.741 --> 02:56:05.124]  And so, you're about to see my full commitment.
[02:56:05.124 --> 02:56:08.306]  I am preparing to go into absolute maniac mode.
[02:56:08.306 --> 02:56:11.789]  Like I'm dying if I don't win, because I'm gonna die if we don't win.
[02:56:11.789 --> 02:56:15.032]  All of us are gonna be screwed over by these control freaks.
[02:56:15.032 --> 02:56:18.014]  And so, just commit to spread the articles, the videos.
[02:56:18.014 --> 02:56:19.275]  Commit to go to InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:20.489 --> 02:56:22.851]  We have a big sale that's going to have to end when it sells out.

[02:57:12.547 --> 02:57:15.768]  It's amazing what it's doing for me during this whole cedar season.
[02:57:15.768 --> 02:57:16.428]  It's incredible.
[02:57:16.428 --> 02:57:17.568]  It's 51% off out of the gate.
[02:57:17.568 --> 02:57:17.588]  $17.76.

[02:57:27.075 --> 02:57:33.462]  If not, we'll go down swinging, and we can hold out probably two, three years.
[02:57:33.462 --> 02:57:35.304]  We're a long game war here.
[02:57:35.304 --> 02:57:36.906]  We've got it all algorithmed out.
[02:57:36.906 --> 02:57:41.771]  Commit now to support us, or we'll be a great example like the Alamo for the bigger victory.
[02:57:41.771 --> 02:57:42.612]  Either way, it's God's plan.
[02:57:44.116 --> 02:57:48.741]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[02:57:48.741 --> 02:57:56.390]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[02:57:56.390 --> 02:58:00.355]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:58:00.555 --> 02:58:06.758]  Prepare this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[02:58:06.758 --> 02:58:13.361]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:58:13.361 --> 02:58:23.486]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:58:23.626 --> 02:58:30.531]  The Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:58:30.531 --> 02:58:33.393]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.
[02:58:33.393 --> 02:58:37.016]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[02:58:37.016 --> 02:58:42.019]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:42.019 --> 02:58:43.921]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:47.308 --> 02:59:05.698]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:59:05.698 --> 02:59:11.981]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:59:11.981 --> 02:59:12.761]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:59:12.761 --> 02:59:15.903]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:59:16.583 --> 02:59:18.124]  And so much more.
[02:59:18.124 --> 02:59:19.465]  It is concentrated.
[02:59:19.465 --> 02:59:21.206]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:59:21.206 --> 02:59:27.009]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:59:27.009 --> 02:59:28.230]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:30.251]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:59:30.251 --> 02:59:32.832]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:59:32.832 --> 02:59:34.273]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:59:34.273 --> 02:59:36.634]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:59:36.634 --> 02:59:37.335]  Immune Wall.
[02:59:37.335 --> 02:59:38.776]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:38.776 --> 02:59:39.936]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:48.692 --> 03:00:00.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.781 --> 03:00:10.128]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:10.128 --> 03:00:17.174]  Alright, the often amazing, always incredible Leanne McAdoo is coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:17.614 --> 03:00:21.718]  Final segment with Roger Stone because he's got big breaking things he has to beaver away at.
[03:00:21.718 --> 03:00:25.702]  We'll be back on The War Room at three o'clock today in one hour central.
[03:00:25.702 --> 03:00:28.084]  Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:28.084 --> 03:00:32.368]  I barely plugged during the show today because the bigger the news day, the more big things are happening.
[03:00:32.368 --> 03:00:35.091]  I just can't get focused on it, but we need to fund our operation.
[03:00:35.091 --> 03:00:38.935]  You talk about brain forage, you talk about the products you love, Roger, but separate from that,
[03:00:40.822 --> 03:00:43.425]  Clearly we're delivering on bringing back America.
[03:00:43.425 --> 03:00:44.966]  Clearly we're under attack.
[03:00:44.966 --> 03:00:49.871]  And I'm not bitching, I'm just letting folks know we're under attack because we're telling the truth.
[03:00:49.871 --> 03:00:51.052]  We've changed the world here.
[03:00:51.752 --> 03:00:58.018]  But all the things, Obama's lawyers suing you, all the attacks, I mean, they're trying to destroy us.
[03:00:58.018 --> 03:00:59.740]  This is total war.
[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:02.122]  So I want to thank the listeners for their support as we enter 2018.
[03:01:02.122 --> 03:01:08.248]  But I want to just remind them, as I told you on election night, man, yeah, I'm glad Trump got elected.
[03:01:08.248 --> 03:01:10.050]  Now the fight is on.
[03:01:10.050 --> 03:01:12.292]  Because we've got to make sure this success happens.
[03:01:12.292 --> 03:01:12.993]  He gets that too.
[03:01:13.613 --> 03:01:15.694]  Or they're going to destroy his name, our name.
[03:01:15.694 --> 03:01:18.454]  They're going to demonize capitalism, Christianity.
[03:01:18.454 --> 03:01:20.755]  This is the big battle right now.
[03:01:20.755 --> 03:01:22.435]  A lot of folks are betting on China.
[03:01:22.435 --> 03:01:24.016]  They're hoping this stalls out.
[03:01:24.016 --> 03:01:29.477]  They're hoping to get a Jimmy Carter type elected if, you know, in a few years, if this thing stalls.
[03:01:29.477 --> 03:01:32.278]  So this is a total death battle.
[03:01:32.278 --> 03:01:36.659]  So let's do that call to arms for support, Roger, in your own words, for InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:36.659 --> 03:01:38.119]  Because we need folks to commit.
[03:01:39.522 --> 03:01:50.673]  You know what I'm finding, Alex, is that a lot of people are really liking the expanding program David Knight in the Morning with Real News, the war room that Owen Schroeder and I are doing together, and of course they love to tune in for you.
[03:01:50.673 --> 03:01:54.157]  None of this is possible without listener and viewer support.
[03:01:54.157 --> 03:02:01.384]  As I say almost every day, some people have the impression that we have rich right-wing fat cats writing checks to subsidize
[03:02:01.544 --> 03:02:07.549]  I noticed Breitbart got the fat cats, and some of them are good or whatever, but notice there was treachery in Machiavelli.
[03:02:07.549 --> 03:02:08.310]  We get zero of that here.
[03:02:08.310 --> 03:02:08.730]  Zero.
[03:02:26.932 --> 03:02:33.438]  We have total independence in InfoWars, but that's because the people we work for are the people who buy these products.
[03:02:33.438 --> 03:02:40.065]  We don't have any one person who determines what's said on InfoWars, other than the Editor-in-Chief.
[03:02:40.065 --> 03:02:43.528]  This is the most independent media operation I've ever worked with.
[03:02:43.528 --> 03:02:46.711]  And that's why it's so important that people support us at the store.
[03:02:46.711 --> 03:02:49.314]  Where, by the way, my book, The Making of the President 2016,
[03:02:50.495 --> 03:03:00.743]  Which outlines the role that Infowars played in the nomination of Donald Trump so that he could become president can be gotten at a better price than if you went to Amazon.
[03:03:00.743 --> 03:03:05.827]  So folks, please go to the store, support us, and the expansion will be even greater.
[03:03:06.227 --> 03:03:12.628]  When I was in Austin, I got a tour of the studio in construction, which will be state-of-the-art.
[03:03:12.628 --> 03:03:20.610]  And it will just make for much better, stronger, pro-freedom commissions, broadcasts from Austin and around the globe.
[03:03:20.610 --> 03:03:25.431]  And even though that studio is the cutting edge, even Fox News doesn't have one like this, $600,000.
[03:03:25.431 --> 03:03:28.032]  It's another private jet or a mansion.
[03:03:28.032 --> 03:03:28.772]  It goes back into this.
[03:03:29.432 --> 03:03:30.433]  It's the satellites.
[03:03:30.433 --> 03:03:32.795]  We're about to pay for three new satellites.
[03:03:32.795 --> 03:03:35.597]  We have thousands of TV stations that are literally there.
[03:03:35.597 --> 03:03:37.398]  We have to do at least three.
[03:03:37.398 --> 03:03:39.179]  It's a million and a half bucks a year.
[03:03:39.179 --> 03:03:42.382]  This closed captioning is $100,000 a year.
[03:03:42.382 --> 03:03:43.603]  We don't have the money right now.
[03:03:43.603 --> 03:03:46.265]  So I've got to hustle, do some things.
[03:03:46.265 --> 03:03:47.786]  We've got one satellite right now.
[03:03:47.786 --> 03:03:48.927]  It's not the one stations want.
[03:03:48.927 --> 03:03:51.128]  We've already got a bunch of stations picking it up.
[03:03:51.128 --> 03:03:53.150]  So we're in a big push right now, folks.
[03:03:53.150 --> 03:03:54.411]  I'm about to sign big checks.
[03:03:57.930 --> 03:03:59.731]  And soon I'll be able to talk about the stuff behind the scenes.
[03:03:59.731 --> 03:04:01.072]  It's been unbelievable.
[03:04:01.072 --> 03:04:02.252]  And I don't bitch about the attacks.
[03:04:02.252 --> 03:04:06.555]  I expected them, but it's just, if people could see it, you'd really support.
[03:04:06.555 --> 03:04:09.197]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:04:09.197 --> 03:04:09.977]  Get the supplements.
[03:04:09.977 --> 03:04:11.058]  They're life-changing.
[03:04:11.058 --> 03:04:14.740]  But what you know is life-changing is the information warfare.
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:17.662]  All right, Roger, we'll talk to you in the war room in an hour.
[03:04:17.662 --> 03:04:25.006]  Leanne McAdoo's coming up with live transmission from Florida to cover so many issues, go through a raft of clips, and more.
[03:04:25.006 --> 03:04:25.307]  And again,
[03:04:26.121 --> 03:04:27.102]  They're trying to censor.
[03:04:27.102 --> 03:04:27.962]  They're trying to block.
[03:04:27.962 --> 03:04:36.509]  They got the algorithms, but they can't stop you and your email, on your Twitter, Facebook, Google, to your neighbors, your friends, your family saying, hey, this is the show they don't want you to hear.
[03:04:36.509 --> 03:04:39.231]  This is the one they want to shut down.
[03:04:39.231 --> 03:04:40.792]  Spread those links.
[03:04:40.792 --> 03:04:44.135]  Even if you can't buy the products or don't want to, that's fine.
[03:04:44.135 --> 03:04:45.977]  Just spread the links and pray for us.
[03:04:45.977 --> 03:04:47.117]  Thank you all for what you've done.
[03:04:47.117 --> 03:04:48.839]  Those of you that have been steadfast, we want to thank you.
[03:04:48.839 --> 03:04:50.820]  We'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:51.261]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.028 --> 03:04:54.829]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:54.829 --> 03:05:04.975]  The new product at Infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:04.975 --> 03:05:10.479]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:10.479 --> 03:05:13.501]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:05:13.501 --> 03:05:22.287]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:24.366 --> 03:05:32.568]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:32.568 --> 03:05:43.950]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:46.631]  It is amazing!
[03:05:46.631 --> 03:05:51.592]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:05:54.508 --> 03:05:59.496]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:21.752 --> 03:06:28.257]  I am Leigh Ann McAdoo coming to you live and last minute from my studio here in Florida.
[03:06:28.257 --> 03:06:29.818]  So good to be back with you all.
[03:06:29.818 --> 03:06:33.000]  We've got so much to talk about.
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:37.583]  Obviously the big bombshell right now is this FISA memo.
[03:06:37.583 --> 03:06:41.065]  Everyone's talking about it except of course the establishment media.
[03:06:41.065 --> 03:06:42.646]  They don't want to talk about this.
[03:06:42.646 --> 03:06:44.448]  They don't think it's a big deal.
[03:06:44.448 --> 03:06:49.251]  Something that whispers and rumblings that this could send people to jail.
[03:06:49.875 --> 03:06:50.496]  That's great.
[03:07:04.645 --> 03:07:08.787]  Show that they're putting on is what we're being told that the Republicans have nothing.
[03:07:08.787 --> 03:07:24.413]  So I'm really interested to find out what's going on and we'll play a little flashback video because just last week we had former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino saying something is about to happen that there is something
[03:07:24.893 --> 03:07:30.838]  A brewing, an explosive scandal ready to burst dealing with this dirty dossier.
[03:07:30.838 --> 03:07:39.845]  So imagine being Hillary Clinton and the DNC and people who thought this dossier was going to bring down Trump and it's actually backfiring.
[03:07:39.845 --> 03:07:46.671]  And man, this is a scandal that is, they're saying it's going to really finally undo President Obama's
[03:07:47.611 --> 03:07:49.932]  Save your image once and for all.
[03:07:49.932 --> 03:07:56.915]  So I want to go ahead and play that clip with Dan Bongino where he's talking about what's breaking this week.
[03:08:01.539 --> 03:08:02.880]  Gosh, where do we start with this case?
[03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:04.480]  This is the biggest mess.
[03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:07.022]  I'm telling you it's the most explosive scandal.
[03:08:07.022 --> 03:08:09.863]  It's getting ready to burst with this OIG report coming out now.
[03:08:09.863 --> 03:08:14.525]  But on this specific incident, it's about the Trump transition record emails with GSA.
[03:08:14.525 --> 03:08:16.206]  Why not get a warrant?
[03:08:16.206 --> 03:08:20.568]  I was a federal investigator for 12 years and a local police officer for four.
[03:08:20.568 --> 03:08:22.009]  Well, worked with the police department for four.
[03:08:22.009 --> 03:08:22.649]  Two years as a cop.
[03:08:23.229 --> 03:08:29.252]  Why not get a warrant in the most consequential counterintelligence investigation in American history?
[03:08:29.252 --> 03:08:30.373]  Why not?
[03:08:30.373 --> 03:08:32.354]  Basically because this is a hoax.
[03:08:32.354 --> 03:08:36.536]  I said to you before the show, we're asking all the wrong questions here.
[03:08:36.536 --> 03:08:41.439]  The question du jour has been, was the dossier used to get a warrant on Trump?
[03:08:41.439 --> 03:08:42.259]  Wrong question.
[03:08:42.259 --> 03:08:43.480]  Important question, but the wrong one.
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:47.466]  The real question is, why get a warrant at all?
[03:08:47.466 --> 03:08:50.150]  Why was the Trump team being spied on?
[03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:55.938]  Nobody has pointed out one single predicate crime to point out why Donald Trump's team is being spied on.
[03:08:55.938 --> 03:08:56.239]  Not one.
[03:08:57.310 --> 03:08:57.890]  Exactly.
[03:08:57.890 --> 03:09:00.352]  I mean, are the Democrats okay with this?
[03:09:00.352 --> 03:09:01.172]  Are they okay?
[03:09:01.172 --> 03:09:13.538]  Because it was President Obama and his DOJ and his buddies that were actually involved in this scandal and surveilling a citizen, a private citizen at that point.
[03:09:13.538 --> 03:09:17.300]  President Trump hadn't even clenched the nomination.
[03:09:19.332 --> 03:09:28.985]  You know, for some reason, even with the votes against releasing this and declassifying this FISA memo, saying, no, no, no, the American people, they don't need to know about this.
[03:09:28.985 --> 03:09:29.325]  Why?
[03:09:29.325 --> 03:09:34.292]  I mean, are they okay with this abuse of power, this apparent abuse of power?
[03:09:35.299 --> 03:09:43.002]  You know, I guess that means that they're going to let the tyrant Trump turn around and do the same thing coming up in 2018 and 2020.
[03:09:43.002 --> 03:09:47.984]  I mean, this is a real problem, and that is why people are saying this is huge.
[03:09:47.984 --> 03:09:57.988]  The American people need to know, at the very least, release the memo so that it will stop all the conspiracy theories that are going to play out because of this.
[03:09:57.988 --> 03:10:03.511]  Now, this is a memo circulating on the Hill, but it was written by Republicans, classified by Republicans.
[03:10:05.103 --> 03:10:06.744]  Why don't they just get it declassified?
[03:10:06.744 --> 03:10:10.667]  They're putting it on the Democrats to declassify it.
[03:10:10.667 --> 03:10:13.469]  So it is kind of a game that's being played right now.
[03:10:13.469 --> 03:10:23.176]  A lot of people are also saying, well, why doesn't the president just declassify that original FISA order in the first place so we can see who was really behind all of this?
[03:10:24.036 --> 03:10:29.478]  I feel like if the president were to do something like that, he would still be turned into the enemy.
[03:10:29.478 --> 03:10:30.678]  He would be demonized.
[03:10:30.678 --> 03:10:34.339]  It wouldn't make as big of a splash.
[03:10:34.339 --> 03:10:38.021]  And we all know that President Trump has a flair for the dramatic.
[03:10:38.021 --> 03:10:47.624]  So perhaps he is, you know, holding out to really, really underscore and completely rewrite the legacy of the former president and his administration.
[03:10:48.364 --> 03:11:09.255]  And so many people are saying that this is going to be completely devastating and that once and for all it's going to be the toughest pill to swallow for the media who has just really been riding on this Russian collusion narrative and trying, you notice when it all sort of circled back around to the Democrats with this dossier, that kind of got pushed away, kind of got silenced.
[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:13.441]  You know, it's interesting that this broke last night.
[03:11:13.441 --> 03:11:19.143]  I couldn't get any sleep because the release the memo hashtag went viral on Twitter.
[03:11:19.143 --> 03:11:24.025]  The fact that that was even allowed to go viral on Twitter was very interesting in itself.
[03:11:24.025 --> 03:11:28.666]  Maybe Jack must have been asleep or something to allow that to go viral.
[03:11:28.666 --> 03:11:36.809]  But this this memo is naming and shaming those who sought to deliberately undermine and obstruct Trump's presidency.
[03:11:36.809 --> 03:11:38.110]  So this is a big deal.
[03:11:38.850 --> 03:11:44.956]  And so let's go to another video that we have Congressman Matt Gaetz.
[03:11:44.956 --> 03:11:49.480]  He's actually talking to Fox News, explaining a little bit about this FISA memo.
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:53.844]  It's a long clip, so we'll just try to get into the meat of it here.
[03:11:53.844 --> 03:11:56.787]  He's saying that this could end the Mueller investigation once and for all.
[03:11:57.619 --> 03:11:58.859]  Have you seen the memo, sir?
[03:11:58.859 --> 03:11:59.940]  Yes or no?
[03:11:59.940 --> 03:12:06.102]  I have, and I share the concerns that have just been expressed by Congressman Meadows and Congressman Jordan.
[03:12:06.102 --> 03:12:21.626]  Our republic is in jeopardy if we allow this type of a palace coup environment to continue to persist, and that's why I'm one of the members of Congress who will be encouraging today Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes to release the memo.
[03:12:21.626 --> 03:12:23.427]  We can have a vote in the Intelligence Committee.
[03:12:23.747 --> 03:12:30.030]  A vote of the full House of Representatives, and this is a matter of such importance that I think we need to do it immediately.
[03:12:30.030 --> 03:12:34.893]  I mean, listening to some of this reaction, characterize what's in the memo.
[03:12:34.893 --> 03:12:36.234]  What's it say?
[03:12:36.234 --> 03:12:42.577]  Unfortunately, I can't get into the specific details in a top-secret document, but that's why we have to release it.
[03:12:42.577 --> 03:12:48.200]  I don't think it's appropriate for just members of Congress to be horrified by the activities that were
[03:12:49.060 --> 03:12:50.761]  One comment said it was like the KGB.
[03:12:50.761 --> 03:12:51.721]  This is really strong language.
[03:13:09.866 --> 03:13:19.609]  Is the suggestion that the abuse on behalf of federal government was indeed spying on Americans without their knowledge and without proper legal authority?
[03:13:19.609 --> 03:13:21.450]  Yes or no?
[03:13:21.450 --> 03:13:24.150]  Again, that would get into the specific contents of the memo.
[03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:25.011]  I can tell you that
[03:13:26.171 --> 03:13:30.073]  We can never live in a country where this type of thing happens.
[03:13:30.073 --> 03:13:37.216]  And particularly the authentication processes that are laid out in the memo are of such fiction.
[03:13:37.216 --> 03:13:41.919]  They are so laughable that they would never withstand scrutiny from the public.
[03:13:41.919 --> 03:13:48.502]  And what I'm worried about is that the cast of characters identified in this memo is not a group of people who are gone.
[03:13:49.222 --> 03:13:51.763]  Many of these people are still in our government.
[03:13:51.763 --> 03:13:55.623]  They still wield influence, and that's why we've got to get this information out in public.
[03:13:55.623 --> 03:13:59.524]  But you just said people will be fired at the FBI and Department of Justice, right?
[03:13:59.524 --> 03:14:00.404]  Possibly worse.
[03:14:00.404 --> 03:14:06.985]  I think that there could be people who could face criminal consequences as a result of the activities that are laid out in this memo.
[03:14:06.985 --> 03:14:15.267]  And it's easy to see after reading this memo why Senator Grassley and why Senator Graham wanted to refer this matter for criminal prosecution.
[03:14:15.267 --> 03:14:16.027]  Laws were broken.
[03:14:16.227 --> 03:14:18.628]  This is a big deal here.
[03:14:18.628 --> 03:14:19.509]  Will we see it?
[03:14:19.509 --> 03:14:20.810]  Yes or no?
[03:14:20.810 --> 03:14:21.370]  Yes.
[03:14:21.370 --> 03:14:37.119]  I have every confidence after speaking with Paul Ryan and Devin Nunes that after we go through the right procedures and provide the adequate notice to the executive branch that we will release this memo but we need the public to continue to call for it and I'm encouraged that within the last half
[03:14:37.199 --> 03:14:37.439]  Absolutely.
[03:14:37.439 --> 03:14:38.240]  Thank you for your time.
[03:15:01.974 --> 03:15:02.414]  Right.
[03:15:02.414 --> 03:15:10.579]  The American people deserve to know if there is evidence of illegal FBI and DOJ buying on the Trump campaign.
[03:15:10.579 --> 03:15:11.759]  At the behest of whom?
[03:15:11.759 --> 03:15:12.820]  Hillary Clinton?
[03:15:12.820 --> 03:15:14.101]  President Barack Obama?
[03:15:14.101 --> 03:15:15.942]  Who ordered this?
[03:15:15.942 --> 03:15:19.304]  Whose heads are going to roll with this memo?
[03:15:19.304 --> 03:15:20.664]  We do want to know.
[03:15:20.664 --> 03:15:23.466]  This is something that's, you know, pretty incredible.
[03:15:24.026 --> 03:15:26.748]  And we're going to have more on this in a minute.
[03:15:26.748 --> 03:15:35.675]  I want to get into Cuomo talking about, you can just see the nerves there trying to, you know, tell us why this is so important.
[03:15:35.675 --> 03:15:37.257]  Why do the American people need to know?
[03:15:37.257 --> 03:15:46.284]  Now, sneaky Dianne Feinstein released the whole Glenn Simpson testimony with Fusion GPS because she felt pressured by some person.
[03:15:46.284 --> 03:15:48.385]  You know, American people needed to know that.
[03:15:48.385 --> 03:15:51.628]  But we'll get into this a little bit more right after this short break.
[03:15:52.725 --> 03:15:53.525]  This is Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.525 --> 03:15:55.326]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[03:15:55.326 --> 03:15:56.986]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[03:15:56.986 --> 03:15:59.806]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[03:15:59.806 --> 03:16:02.087]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[03:16:02.087 --> 03:16:06.608]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[03:16:06.608 --> 03:16:10.549]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[03:16:10.549 --> 03:16:14.310]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[03:16:14.310 --> 03:16:14.630]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:16.370]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.795 --> 03:16:23.676]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[03:16:23.676 --> 03:16:26.898]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[03:16:26.898 --> 03:16:28.518]  Savory and delicious.
[03:16:28.518 --> 03:16:31.340]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:31.340 --> 03:16:32.000]  Awesome.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:35.102]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[03:16:35.102 --> 03:16:36.663]  NASA PAC Technology.
[03:16:36.663 --> 03:16:37.283]  Bacon.
[03:16:37.283 --> 03:16:41.445]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[03:16:41.445 --> 03:16:42.866]  Or warm and served.

[03:18:05.699 --> 03:18:10.983]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:18:10.983 --> 03:18:13.524]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:13.524 --> 03:18:17.747]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:17.747 --> 03:18:20.189]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.

[03:19:56.336 --> 03:19:58.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:14.039 --> 03:20:18.912]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:20:18.912 --> 03:20:22.521]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:22.521 --> 03:20:22.882]  Alright.
[03:20:23.570 --> 03:20:25.372]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.372 --> 03:20:31.578]  I am Leigh-Anne McAdoo hosting the fourth hour and we've got a lot of clips to run through here.
[03:20:31.578 --> 03:20:38.684]  Let's talk about this looming government shutdown that is, you know, got everyone's feathers ruffled.
[03:20:38.684 --> 03:20:43.369]  Of course, we know no matter what, it is going to be blamed on the Republicans.
[03:20:43.369 --> 03:20:46.532]  Well, they just wouldn't cow to the demands of the Democrats.
[03:20:47.752 --> 03:20:49.433]  We know that's going to happen either way.
[03:20:49.433 --> 03:21:02.435]  So today at today's White House press briefing, this was kind of brought up like, you know, you want to say this is Schumer's shutdown because the Democrats are refusing to work with the Republicans.
[03:21:02.435 --> 03:21:07.576]  But, you know, the Republicans control the House and the Senate and the White House.
[03:21:07.576 --> 03:21:10.337]  So, you know, can't the Republicans just get this done?
[03:21:11.598 --> 03:21:14.182]  No, that's not really how it works.
[03:21:14.182 --> 03:21:24.217]  And so the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, actually slammed Jim Acosta and said, come on, buddy, you know as well as everyone, that's just not how it works.
[03:21:28.499 --> 03:21:32.002]  You said this was the Schumer shutdown.
[03:21:32.002 --> 03:21:37.205]  How can it be the Schumer shutdown when Republicans control the White House, the House, and the Senate?
[03:21:37.205 --> 03:21:38.947]  Come on, you know the answer to that as well as anybody.
[03:21:38.947 --> 03:21:44.150]  I mean, I have to laugh when people say that, oh, we control the House, the Senate, the White House, why can't you get this done?
[03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:48.934]  You know as well as anybody that it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass an appropriations bill, right?
[03:21:48.934 --> 03:21:49.274]  You know that.
[03:21:49.594 --> 03:21:50.095]  I know that.
[03:21:50.095 --> 03:21:57.143]  Okay, so if you only have 51 votes in the Senate, then you have to have Democrat support in order to keep the government, to fund the government.
[03:21:57.143 --> 03:21:58.104]  So that's the answer to your question.
[03:21:58.104 --> 03:22:01.608]  The President asked Congress to come up with a solution for the Dreamers.
[03:22:01.608 --> 03:22:06.032]  Congress was in the room, members of Congress were in the room with the President last week.
[03:22:06.032 --> 03:22:08.735]  It seemed to be a fairly productive meeting.
[03:22:08.735 --> 03:22:10.698]  And then the whole process got blown up.
[03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:21.586]  It seems that the whole process was blown up by the president's comments.
[03:22:21.586 --> 03:22:36.798]  When Republicans tried to add a discussion about Obamacare to the funding process in 2013, we are accused by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of inserting a non-fiscal, a non-financial issue into the spending process in order to shut the government down.
[03:22:36.798 --> 03:22:37.278]  How is that not
[03:22:37.278 --> 03:22:37.959]  Not exactly.
[03:22:58.464 --> 03:22:58.704]  Right.
[03:22:58.704 --> 03:23:04.608]  And of course, so if there's no compromise on the budget by midnight, this shutdown will be finalized.
[03:23:04.608 --> 03:23:12.554]  And, you know, like Mulvaney points out, they're trying to push something on DACA and the Dreamers, and it's just not necessary.
[03:23:12.554 --> 03:23:18.978]  Now, yeah, maybe if we were dealing with the former administration and many administrations before this one, it does take
[03:23:19.702 --> 03:23:22.284]  Forever, to get anything done in Congress.
[03:23:22.284 --> 03:23:26.187]  But the President already said he had that open door, transparent meeting.
[03:23:26.187 --> 03:23:27.428]  All the press was invited in.
[03:23:27.428 --> 03:23:31.571]  He said, look, I'm going to sign whatever you guys send me.
[03:23:31.571 --> 03:23:32.231]  Whatever you send me.
[03:23:32.231 --> 03:23:35.293]  If you guys are able to work together and compromise, I'm going to sign it.
[03:23:35.293 --> 03:23:36.915]  We're not going to be going back and forth.
[03:23:36.915 --> 03:23:40.637]  So we can hold off on dealing with the Dreamers.
[03:23:40.637 --> 03:23:44.180]  We don't need to wrap that up in this budget.
[03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:46.962]  It doesn't have anything to do with keeping the government open.
[03:23:47.302 --> 03:23:55.927]  So the Democrats are trying to derail and hold the government hostage in order to get the demands of their illegal immigrants met.
[03:23:55.927 --> 03:23:57.108]  Totally crazy.
[03:23:57.108 --> 03:23:59.990]  So I was seeing this narrative coming up on Twitter.
[03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:02.251]  Well, you know, the Republicans control everything.
[03:24:02.251 --> 03:24:04.292]  Why don't they just pass it?
[03:24:04.292 --> 03:24:06.713]  And that's not how it works.
[03:24:06.713 --> 03:24:08.855]  But CNN and Jim Acosta
[03:24:09.675 --> 03:24:11.596]  He was just going to run with this narrative.
[03:24:11.596 --> 03:24:21.578]  Can you imagine if they would have just ran with this narrative and Mulvaney never would have checked them and said, come on, that's not, you know that you need 60 votes to be able to pass this through the Senate.
[03:24:21.578 --> 03:24:25.519]  Why would you even put out that fake news, that propaganda?
[03:24:25.519 --> 03:24:27.880]  But that's what we're dealing with here.
[03:24:27.880 --> 03:24:36.462]  So there's a video actually by John Bowne where he talks about Jim Acosta being compared to Charles Manson working for the PSYOP organization.
[03:24:36.462 --> 03:24:37.342]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[03:24:39.207 --> 03:24:39.908]  Nothing to see here, folks.
[03:24:39.908 --> 03:24:43.030]  Just more yellow journalism being force-fed to you by the Gellin Organization offshoot.
[03:24:59.121 --> 03:24:59.661]  We're good to go.
[03:25:16.212 --> 03:25:21.036]  CBS Newsweek and the New York Times were in Wisner's back pocket.
[03:25:21.036 --> 03:25:30.243]  Phil Graham of the Washington Post ran the cabal of journalists for Wisner that would control the public mind, an operation that continues to this very day.
[03:25:30.243 --> 03:25:38.750]  Edward Bernays said, we are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested.
[03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:44.415]  Are these PSYOP organizations not the very definition of an enemy of the people?
[03:25:44.415 --> 03:25:45.476]  Thomas Jefferson wrote,
[03:25:45.996 --> 03:25:49.737]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[03:25:49.737 --> 03:25:54.878]  So, from the very beginning, our freedom has been predicated on truth.
[03:25:54.878 --> 03:26:07.621]  The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.
[03:26:07.621 --> 03:26:13.003]  The enemy of the people was how the President of the United States called the free press in 2017.
[03:26:15.287 --> 03:26:26.652]  Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies.
[03:26:26.652 --> 03:26:34.015]  It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase, enemy of the people, that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use.
[03:26:35.095 --> 03:26:53.361]  Telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of quote Annihilating such individuals unquote who disagreed with a supreme leader And if it's okay to compare the president of the United States to Joseph Stalin who was responsible for the deaths of roughly
[03:26:53.581 --> 03:26:56.603]  Mr. President, did you say that you want more people to come in from Norway?
[03:26:56.603 --> 03:26:59.804]  Did you say that you wanted more people to come in from Norway?
[03:26:59.804 --> 03:27:01.425]  Is that true, Mr. President?
[03:27:01.425 --> 03:27:03.366]  I want them to come in from everywhere.
[03:27:03.366 --> 03:27:03.987]  Everywhere.
[03:27:03.987 --> 03:27:05.467]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[03:27:19.735 --> 03:27:25.058]  Just Caucasian or white countries, sir, or do you want people to come in from other parts of the world where there are people of color?
[03:27:25.058 --> 03:27:46.330]  When the gloves completely came off after the quiet suffocation of the 65-year-old Smith-Munn Act that was tucked away in Obama's 2013 NDAA, unshackling Obama's State Department to allow total propaganda to run like a feral cat through the collective consciousness of the United States,
[03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:59.272]  The Smith Month Modernization Act of 2012, passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, will allow the CIA to flood America with more government propaganda.
[03:27:59.272 --> 03:28:06.354]  Frank Church revealed in 1975 how the establishment media works hand in glove with the CIA.
[03:28:06.354 --> 03:28:12.015]  I thought that it was a matter of real concern.
[03:28:13.835 --> 03:28:30.196]  That planted stories intended to serve a national purpose abroad came home and were circulated here and believed here because this would mean that
[03:28:31.576 --> 03:28:37.684]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States by channeling it through some foreign country.
[03:28:37.684 --> 03:28:41.889]  You see, sensationalism has always sold papers.
[03:28:41.889 --> 03:28:47.997]  And of course that cultish disinfo has only increased ever since the repeal of the Smith-Month Modernization Act.
[03:28:48.477 --> 03:28:52.680]  We will have some more real news for you coming up right after this break.

[03:32:24.142 --> 03:32:32.848]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[03:32:33.328 --> 03:32:34.629]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:14.563 --> 03:33:16.705]  You found it.
[03:33:16.705 --> 03:33:21.830]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:23.953]  It's the InfoWar.
[03:33:23.953 --> 03:33:25.374]  And now, Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.374 --> 03:33:26.976]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.976 --> 03:33:31.820]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, hosting live from my Florida studio.
[03:33:31.820 --> 03:33:38.187]  And the only reason I'm able to do this is because of the listeners out there who help support this broadcast.
[03:33:38.747 --> 03:33:45.931]  You allow Alex Jones to not just drop me like a hotcake when I have to come here and take care of some family responsibilities.
[03:33:45.931 --> 03:33:51.614]  I'm able to Skype in and to still be with you guys on a remote basis.
[03:33:52.327 --> 03:33:54.428]  Thank you so much for the support.
[03:33:54.428 --> 03:34:03.851]  And so, of course, none of that is possible without your visiting the InfoWars store, signing up for the newsletter to see all sorts of new and exciting products that we're launching.
[03:34:03.851 --> 03:34:08.472]  One of those being the new InfoWars Shirt of the Month Club.
[03:34:08.472 --> 03:34:11.253]  This is new to me, so I'm really excited about this.
[03:34:11.253 --> 03:34:14.754]  This is every month we're going to be releasing exclusive new shirts.
[03:34:15.274 --> 03:34:18.037]  So you can sign up for this Shirt of the Month Club.
[03:34:18.037 --> 03:34:20.540]  You'll be receiving limited edition shirts.
[03:34:20.540 --> 03:34:25.145]  You'll also be saving 20% on those shirts from the retail price.
[03:34:25.145 --> 03:34:28.688]  You just need to order by the 1st and it'll be on its way on the 10th.
[03:34:29.713 --> 03:34:31.934]  So these shirts are going to be exclusive to the program.
[03:34:31.934 --> 03:34:33.675]  You're not going to be able to find them anywhere else.
[03:34:33.675 --> 03:34:37.336]  They're not going to be, you know, just willy-nilly out there in the store.
[03:34:37.336 --> 03:34:46.940]  As an added bonus, Alex Jones, wow, he is going to sign a random 10 shirts to show his support for the fans that make the Info War possible.
[03:34:46.940 --> 03:34:50.062]  I know when I get back to the studio in Austin, I will sign some of these.
[03:34:51.122 --> 03:34:57.587]  T-shirts as well, just to kind of entice you all to sign up for this Shirt of the Month Club.
[03:34:57.587 --> 03:34:59.328]  These are going to be exclusive.
[03:34:59.328 --> 03:35:10.957]  And the first shirt of this program is the best-selling, Won't Tread on Me, but instead of the typical color in yellow, it's going to come exclusively in red.
[03:35:10.957 --> 03:35:16.882]  So you'll be supporting the Info War, and you're also going to be getting exclusive gear that's going to help you spread the truth.
[03:35:17.722 --> 03:35:20.963]  This is the InfoWars t-shirt of the month program.
[03:35:20.963 --> 03:35:23.023]  Sign up for it today.
[03:35:23.023 --> 03:35:29.445]  I'm hoping to get back in the studio next month, maybe March, and I'm going to sign some of those t-shirts randomly too.
[03:35:29.445 --> 03:35:32.046]  I mean, I'm not even going to ask for Alex's permission.
[03:35:32.046 --> 03:35:35.486]  I'm just going to sign them and we'll send them out.
[03:35:35.486 --> 03:35:37.587]  You know, I wanted to talk about something that just
[03:35:38.622 --> 03:35:43.964]  I couldn't stop laughing, really, about this very sad Gallup poll that is making the rounds today.
[03:35:43.964 --> 03:35:51.126]  As if we care what the rest of the world thinks about President Trump's leadership style.
[03:35:51.126 --> 03:35:55.027]  But apparently that's big news for some of these other media outlets out there.
[03:35:55.487 --> 03:35:58.028]  So, it's a poll.
[03:35:58.028 --> 03:36:00.589]  Under Trump, global approval of U.S.
[03:36:00.589 --> 03:36:03.471]  leadership hits historical low.
[03:36:03.471 --> 03:36:07.112]  It's a historical low of 30% in 2017.
[03:36:07.112 --> 03:36:10.954]  This is other nations' approval of the U.S.
[03:36:10.954 --> 03:36:12.815]  leadership under President Trump.
[03:36:12.815 --> 03:36:24.860]  And so they're saying this measure signals an 18-point drop from just a year earlier when 48% approved of the national influence under former President Barack Obama.
[03:36:25.729 --> 03:36:28.695]  Wow, so what does this mean?
[03:36:28.695 --> 03:36:33.784]  This means that nearly half of the world likes it when the U.S.
[03:36:33.784 --> 03:36:34.325]  leads
[03:36:35.254 --> 03:37:00.124]  By capitulating and kowtowing and, you know, bowing down to militant ISIS commanders and bankrolling state sponsors of terrorists in Iran and sending them billions of dollars in unmarked bills and, you know, saying, hey guys, don't spend this money on acquiring a nuclear weapon or sponsoring any terrorisms, am I right?
[03:37:00.124 --> 03:37:02.005]  You know, the strategic patience
[03:37:02.697 --> 03:37:13.964]  That the leadership style of Obama, he exercised that strategic patience with a nuclear armed madman, rocket man, the baby, right?
[03:37:13.964 --> 03:37:20.749]  And so this is the soft leadership style that apparently nearly half of the world would prefer.
[03:37:20.749 --> 03:37:32.096]  They like that sellout teleprompter president, Obama, who, you know, turned us basically into the United States of apologists.
[03:37:32.580 --> 03:37:38.542]  So it's no wonder that these globalists and these leaders around the world prefer that Obama.
[03:37:38.542 --> 03:37:42.484]  They prefer the guy that was such a great negotiator that he got the U.S.
[03:37:42.484 --> 03:37:48.366]  tied up in all these really bad deals that President Trump is now having to undo.
[03:37:48.366 --> 03:37:49.967]  So what does this say?
[03:37:49.967 --> 03:37:57.150]  That in just one year, this approval rating around the world could just tank.
[03:37:57.150 --> 03:37:57.830]  Oh my goodness.
[03:37:57.830 --> 03:38:01.372]  What could Trump possibly have done to rattle these guys?
[03:38:02.822 --> 03:38:04.862]  He's cut funding to terrorists.
[03:38:04.862 --> 03:38:13.284]  He stopped sending billions of dollars to the United Nations to help support these nations that absolutely do not have our best interests at heart.
[03:38:13.284 --> 03:38:19.725]  They don't respect us when it comes time to make decisions that are going to serve American interests.
[03:38:19.725 --> 03:38:28.687]  He's putting America first in these trade negotiations and putting American safety first with immigration versus, you know, the demands of illegal immigrants.
[03:38:28.687 --> 03:38:31.267]  He has allowed our generals to actually
[03:38:32.068 --> 03:38:34.690]  Decide when to strike terrorists.
[03:38:34.690 --> 03:38:39.532]  So in just a year, we're seeing the near defeat of ISIS.
[03:38:39.532 --> 03:38:41.954]  He's bringing jobs back to the United States.
[03:38:41.954 --> 03:38:44.615]  You know, we got a soaring stock market.
[03:38:44.615 --> 03:38:47.217]  He respects the flag, the rule of law.
[03:38:47.217 --> 03:38:49.978]  So no wonder these globalists don't like him.
[03:38:49.978 --> 03:38:52.059]  They're like, wait, you're making America great again?
[03:38:52.059 --> 03:38:54.261]  We had just destroyed you.
[03:38:55.021 --> 03:38:56.061]  Man.
[03:38:56.061 --> 03:39:00.422]  So anyway, here's to President Trump's approval rating continuing to tank around the globe.
[03:39:00.422 --> 03:39:03.543]  Screw you guys, because Obama's gone.
[03:39:03.543 --> 03:39:04.483]  No.
[03:39:04.483 --> 03:39:05.963]  I want to go ahead and play this clip.
[03:39:05.963 --> 03:39:08.404]  Is it already going?
[03:39:08.404 --> 03:39:11.324]  The FCC manipulating the response of the masses.
[03:39:11.324 --> 03:39:13.285]  Alex Jones report.
[03:39:13.285 --> 03:39:22.827]  I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed.
[03:39:22.827 --> 03:39:23.367]  That I can tell you.
[03:39:24.489 --> 03:39:31.797]  Remember F. Lee Bailey, the famous corrupt lawyer, known for big problems, million dollar fines, you name it.
[03:39:31.797 --> 03:39:34.000]  Remember F. Lee Bailey on the O.J.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:34.860]  Simpson trial?
[03:39:34.860 --> 03:39:36.202]  They had a white guy do it.
[03:39:36.202 --> 03:39:39.525]  Get up and say the N-word over and over and over again to the black jury.
[03:39:40.286 --> 03:39:43.008]  And that's how they got him off.
[03:39:43.008 --> 03:39:45.629]  He said the N-word 41 times.
[03:39:45.629 --> 03:39:48.451]  I want to go to YouTube and grab it for documentary purposes.
[03:39:48.451 --> 03:39:51.613]  They aired it on Court TV, ABC, NBC, NBC.
[03:39:51.613 --> 03:39:57.516]  But I remember years later airing it on Talk Radio and the station manager coming and saying, you don't do that.
[03:39:57.516 --> 03:39:58.437]  And that's the big issue.
[03:39:59.753 --> 03:40:07.400]  CNN, MSNBC, broadcast, you name it, on CBS, ABC, they are saying every 10 minutes, they're playing the clip.
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:17.470]  Sometimes every minute of quoting the president when he says he didn't say it, saying these are S-H-U-K-T countries.
[03:40:18.190 --> 03:40:19.551]  We've got Acosta saying it.
[03:40:19.551 --> 03:40:22.173]  We've got them all saying it on CNN, you name it.
[03:40:22.173 --> 03:40:27.656]  Again, just like F. Lee Bailey saying the N-word over and over and over and over again.
[03:40:27.656 --> 03:40:34.341]  You can't use it, but if a liberal, fraudulent, corrupt lawyer, in my view, wants to use it to manipulate a jury...
[03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:39.531]  Clearly a guilty man go free, as we now know.
[03:40:39.531 --> 03:40:45.996]  If you want to do that, you are a bad person if you're not the establishment.
[03:40:45.996 --> 03:40:47.557]  But if you're the establishment, you can.
[03:40:47.557 --> 03:41:01.427]  So CNN to Inflame Emotions, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, they're all quoting the president as saying this and saying it to get people out of their comfort zone on mainstream TV to suddenly hear them cussing.
[03:41:02.856 --> 03:41:08.061]  If ICUS or a caller slips through, our stations complain.
[03:41:08.061 --> 03:41:12.605]  We've lost affiliates before, because the FCC will selectively fine them.
[03:41:12.605 --> 03:41:19.591]  Or Howard Stern, if he wants to say SHIT, he had to leave Terrestrial Radio, because sometimes it would slip through.
[03:41:19.591 --> 03:41:27.518]  But now mainstream media, they can all do it, because the executives are saying go full bore, do whatever you want.
[03:41:28.427 --> 03:41:29.228]  Take them out.
[03:41:29.228 --> 03:41:35.318]  That's why they've got former Democrat governors on Infowars.com saying they will punch out the president.
[03:41:36.618 --> 03:41:38.179]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:41:38.179 --> 03:41:39.060]  Go kill Republicans.
[03:41:39.060 --> 03:41:40.160]  This is what they say.
[03:41:40.160 --> 03:41:41.181]  And people are getting attacked.
[03:41:41.181 --> 03:41:42.942]  Hot coffee is getting thrown on them.
[03:41:42.942 --> 03:41:43.703]  They're getting shot.
[03:41:43.703 --> 03:41:44.704]  They're getting beat up.
[03:41:44.704 --> 03:41:46.805]  They're getting their families assaulted.
[03:41:46.805 --> 03:41:51.128]  And they think it's funny as they usher this country towards civil war.
[03:41:51.128 --> 03:42:00.755]  And notice the left hadn't come out that I've seen and denied the new documents that came out from the Soros group trying to trigger martial law and race riots when Obama had only a year left in office.
[03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:03.290]  See?
[03:42:03.290 --> 03:42:05.371]  That story up on Infowars.com.
[03:42:05.371 --> 03:42:08.533]  Incredible!
[03:42:08.533 --> 03:42:12.576]  I believe the President that he didn't say it, but we've seen them lie about him over and over again.
[03:42:12.576 --> 03:42:19.241]  I could say that sources say the President snorts methamphetamine in the White House off hookers' rear ends.
[03:42:19.241 --> 03:42:24.024]  Not true, but if I said it on CNN, they would all parrot it to give it credibility.
[03:42:25.279 --> 03:42:26.320]  And it's the same thing.
[03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:29.242]  You never hear them say those things on television.
[03:42:29.242 --> 03:42:39.290]  They're not supposed to under the FCC, but they're doing it because they want to stick the knife in, turn the edge, and then put salt in the wound.
[03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:40.892]  Total manipulation.
[03:42:52.364 --> 03:42:55.786]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:42:55.786 --> 03:42:59.747]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:42:59.747 --> 03:43:03.089]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:03.089 --> 03:43:05.630]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:10.352]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:43:10.352 --> 03:43:12.713]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:12.713 --> 03:43:19.096]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:19.716 --> 03:43:27.919]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:27.919 --> 03:43:32.960]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:39.943]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:43:40.603 --> 03:43:45.505]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[03:43:45.505 --> 03:43:48.667]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:43:48.667 --> 03:43:59.492]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:44:02.441 --> 03:44:07.064]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:07.064 --> 03:44:09.405]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:44:09.405 --> 03:44:11.186]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:11.186 --> 03:44:16.469]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:18.090]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:24.435]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:44:24.435 --> 03:44:26.277]  Secret 12.
[03:44:26.277 --> 03:44:27.418]  Optimal absorption.
[03:44:27.418 --> 03:44:32.562]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:44:32.562 --> 03:44:37.747]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:44:37.747 --> 03:44:38.488]  Optimum levels.
[03:44:39.913 --> 03:44:44.075]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[03:44:44.075 --> 03:44:48.677]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[03:44:48.677 --> 03:44:52.538]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:45:09.065 --> 03:45:15.191]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[03:45:15.191 --> 03:45:21.798]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[03:45:21.798 --> 03:45:31.948]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[03:45:32.168 --> 03:45:38.975]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[03:45:38.975 --> 03:45:41.837]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[03:45:41.837 --> 03:45:45.461]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[03:45:45.461 --> 03:45:50.446]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:50.446 --> 03:45:52.368]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:53.028 --> 03:45:58.194]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[03:45:58.194 --> 03:46:02.960]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[03:46:02.960 --> 03:46:07.565]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and
[03:46:07.725 --> 03:46:11.648]  And releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[03:46:11.648 --> 03:46:15.151]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[03:46:15.151 --> 03:46:20.396]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[03:46:20.396 --> 03:46:27.302]  Floralife supports your body's core where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[03:46:27.702 --> 03:46:31.606]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[03:46:31.606 --> 03:46:36.330]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[03:46:36.330 --> 03:46:44.417]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.

[03:46:56.276 --> 03:47:04.547]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:04.547 --> 03:47:09.754]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:47:09.754 --> 03:47:11.596]  Watch me!
[03:47:11.596 --> 03:47:13.599]  Watch me!
[03:47:13.599 --> 03:47:14.100]  I got it!
[03:47:15.909 --> 03:47:17.550]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:18.570]  This is the last segment.
[03:47:18.570 --> 03:47:19.430]  I'll be with you.
[03:47:19.430 --> 03:47:23.831]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo coming live from Florida.
[03:47:23.831 --> 03:47:29.433]  And right now we are really witnessing the media crumbling.
[03:47:29.433 --> 03:47:30.253]  They're in a panic.
[03:47:30.253 --> 03:47:32.814]  The only thing they've got is name-calling.
[03:47:32.814 --> 03:47:34.915]  There's so much winning with President Trump.
[03:47:34.915 --> 03:47:42.397]  He's really trying to bring people together and actually attempting to be the most transparent administration ever by holding these open-door meetings.
[03:47:43.617 --> 03:47:49.279]  And Jim Acosta wants to say, well, you know, we could have got DACA, Trump said, but then he used bad language.
[03:47:49.279 --> 03:47:51.000]  So it's off the table now.
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:58.142]  I mean, all of these excuses and it's people are wearing is wearing us down.
[03:47:58.142 --> 03:47:59.762]  I mean, people are really tired of this.
[03:47:59.762 --> 03:48:05.564]  And so it's not a wonder that trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low.
[03:48:05.564 --> 03:48:11.586]  People know and believe that they are being lied to, that stories are being made up, that videos are being edited.
[03:48:12.167 --> 03:48:15.960]  And that's why people couldn't get enough of Trump's fake news awards.
[03:48:15.960 --> 03:48:17.947]  And they were like, yes, please do this.
[03:48:18.664 --> 03:48:43.449]  And so I guess in an effort to, you know, undo some of that apparent bias that has earned them top billing on the fake news awards, we have the New York Times and CNN, other outlets actually talking to real life Trump supporters and not just the crazy circus freaks that they try to find at every rally to say, well, look, I told you they're all racist.
[03:48:44.156 --> 03:48:54.359]  No, they're actually talking to just your average American, educated, cares about their country, concerned with what's happening here.
[03:48:54.359 --> 03:49:01.821]  And these were done this week, Wednesday, Thursday, in a series of letters to the editor in the New York Times.
[03:49:01.821 --> 03:49:02.641]  And they just
[03:49:03.251 --> 03:49:03.751]  We're good to go.
[03:49:25.004 --> 03:49:27.987]  Admitting they don't normally give a voice to Trump supporters.
[03:49:27.987 --> 03:49:30.830]  So again, and they're doing this in the spirit of open debate.
[03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:37.916]  So all of these, these are really great if you've got the ability to access these New York Times articles and read some of them.
[03:49:37.916 --> 03:49:44.162]  They make a really good case for giving this president high marks for his progress.
[03:49:44.162 --> 03:49:50.608]  They talk about him nearly defeating ISIS, cutting taxes for middle class families, making those great court appointments.
[03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.449]  We're good.
[03:50:06.099 --> 03:50:07.561]  Um, you know, newsflash!
[03:50:07.561 --> 03:50:10.924]  Not everyone is Hillary Clinton's deplorables.
[03:50:10.924 --> 03:50:15.848]  A lot of Trump supporters are well informed and care about the country.
[03:50:15.848 --> 03:50:25.397]  And so this was, you know, it seemed as if it's an effort by the New York Times to be more fair and balanced, but that's not what's happening here.
[03:50:25.397 --> 03:50:27.359]  When CNN goes and wants to talk to those
[03:50:27.919 --> 03:50:30.441]  Former Democrats who switched and vote for Trump.
[03:50:30.441 --> 03:50:32.883]  Oh, well, we want to hear how do you feel a year later?
[03:50:32.883 --> 03:50:34.525]  Were you happy with your decision?
[03:50:34.525 --> 03:50:35.465]  They don't care.
[03:50:35.465 --> 03:50:48.136]  I mean, it's just like the drive-by journalism they did right after the election when they went out to places and painted all the Trump voters as these poor people in these factory towns who just
[03:50:48.696 --> 03:50:52.398]  We're duped by this president and he's not really going to do anything for them.
[03:50:52.398 --> 03:50:58.401]  Lo and behold, a year later, jobs are coming back, more money in people's pockets.
[03:50:58.401 --> 03:51:01.023]  And so what's really happening here is the media
[03:51:01.889 --> 03:51:06.210]  Is trying to regain a lot of that lost audience they had.
[03:51:06.210 --> 03:51:10.871]  And they want to bring in those Trump supporters and say, look guys, we know we've been unfair.
[03:51:10.871 --> 03:51:12.912]  We're going to give you a shot.
[03:51:12.912 --> 03:51:17.913]  We're going to let you air your grievances and print your letters to the editor.
[03:51:17.913 --> 03:51:23.655]  We're going to hire some conservative columnists like Bret Stephens at the New York Times.
[03:51:23.655 --> 03:51:28.556]  But what they don't tell you is that these conservative columnists are never Trumpers.
[03:51:29.156 --> 03:51:41.487]  So even though they're trying to get away from their coastal, elitist, liberal bias that they've really been pegged with, they're trying to say, you know, we're being more fair about it.
[03:51:41.487 --> 03:51:42.427]  They're never Trumpers.
[03:51:42.427 --> 03:51:53.497]  So any story that you're going to get out of these outlets, even though they're giving a conservative slant, they're going to be filtered through that negative, never Trumper bias.
[03:51:54.077 --> 03:51:55.999]  And so that's what's happening here.
[03:51:55.999 --> 03:52:02.504]  This is to try to regain some of that objectivity for the 2018 elections coming up.
[03:52:02.504 --> 03:52:02.884]  2018 and 2020.
[03:52:02.884 --> 03:52:09.669]  They want to try and dupe us into believing that they are now, all of a sudden, going to be objective.
[03:52:09.669 --> 03:52:20.838]  Because, again, after the repeal, or the Smith Month Modernization Act in 2012 went into effect in 2013, that was really when you could see the media
[03:52:21.860 --> 03:52:22.240]  We're good.
[03:52:42.759 --> 03:52:44.360]  pushing propaganda on U.S.
[03:52:44.360 --> 03:52:44.961]  citizens.
[03:52:44.961 --> 03:52:52.966]  They were pumping it out to the rest of the world, but, you know, they weren't supposed to be pushing propaganda on the United States.
[03:52:52.966 --> 03:52:55.368]  That was revealed at the church hearings.
[03:52:55.368 --> 03:53:05.315]  And so then with this Smith-Month Modernization Act signed by, you know, good old President Obama, they're allowed to push propaganda now.
[03:53:05.315 --> 03:53:07.236]  They don't have to hide it.
[03:53:07.236 --> 03:53:11.099]  And by golly, they sure have been, especially with this dirty dossier.
[03:53:12.159 --> 03:53:14.540]  Now, I want to go to another clip.
[03:53:14.540 --> 03:53:17.540]  This one is Rob Dew and Alex Jones.
[03:53:17.540 --> 03:53:29.123]  They talk about, you know, speaking of propaganda, think about Silicon Valley, Twitter, Facebook, how they're controlling the information that we are allowed to read and to speak.
[03:53:29.123 --> 03:53:33.244]  It's all a form of that control and that psyop machine.
[03:53:33.244 --> 03:53:36.745]  So let's go to this report by Alex Jones and Rob Dew.
[03:53:37.398 --> 03:53:46.784]  Knowing the power of the people, knowing that was coming on the internet, they created these things so people would make it big, and then now they come in and censor it while they want to censor any other site.
[03:53:46.784 --> 03:53:47.765]  These are internet ghettos.
[03:53:47.765 --> 03:53:53.749]  But it's a fraud, it's racketeering, it's fake advertising, it's discrimination.
[03:53:53.749 --> 03:53:54.909]  We hit them there.
[03:53:54.909 --> 03:53:56.931]  But like Matt Drudge said, and as I've said,
[03:53:57.984 --> 03:54:01.065]  We've got to create our own websites like InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com.
[03:54:01.065 --> 03:54:03.565]  We've got to create our own platforms.
[03:54:03.565 --> 03:54:11.007]  And listeners have to go to those platforms realizing and share that info, realizing that it's all up to us.
[03:54:11.007 --> 03:54:24.730]  If you go to NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and if you go there and if you share those links on the enemy's platforms with your own email, your own by hand, they can't stop us.
[03:54:25.470 --> 03:54:27.171]  So at the end of the day, it's up to you.
[03:54:27.171 --> 03:54:29.792]  But they are already ratcheting us down.
[03:54:29.792 --> 03:54:33.174]  But because we fought so hard, we've stayed the same size last year.
[03:54:33.174 --> 03:54:35.195]  Which has completely confounded them.
[03:54:35.195 --> 03:54:36.576]  So they're in panic mode.
[03:54:36.576 --> 03:54:39.017]  That's why they have congressional hearings and everything else.
[03:54:39.017 --> 03:54:41.238]  Because it's not working.
[03:54:41.238 --> 03:54:42.039]  Well, the answer is...
[03:54:42.999 --> 03:54:48.541]  Sue Congressman Quigley saying shut us down as fake news for civil rights violations.
[03:54:48.541 --> 03:54:50.282]  And we're behind the scenes suing people.
[03:54:50.282 --> 03:54:51.782]  There'll be public lawsuits, don't worry.
[03:54:51.782 --> 03:54:53.683]  But we're doing it.
[03:54:53.683 --> 03:54:58.364]  You were ahead of your time by creating, you created a social media platform years ago.
[03:54:58.364 --> 03:54:59.945]  It ended up, you know, kind of dying.
[03:54:59.945 --> 03:55:03.786]  Well, it got infiltrated and it wasn't all fancy with CIA money.
[03:55:03.786 --> 03:55:04.146]  Right, right.
[03:55:04.146 --> 03:55:05.287]  You didn't have CIA backing.
[03:55:05.287 --> 03:55:07.327]  You didn't have the push to the front.
[03:55:07.327 --> 03:55:12.089]  But still, it's people that need to make things like that, like their own social media sites to
[03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:17.727]  Take away... And then Gab did and Google bans it on there and then calls for it to be shut down.
[03:55:17.727 --> 03:55:18.811]  Right, they don't want competition.
[03:55:19.662 --> 03:55:24.666]  And it's like, hey, if you don't like what the people are saying on Gab, don't respond to them, or don't follow them.
[03:55:24.666 --> 03:55:26.087]  But it's way beyond all that.
[03:55:26.087 --> 03:55:29.029]  We're under total criminal censorship attack.
[03:55:29.029 --> 03:55:29.730]  Oh, yeah.
[03:55:29.730 --> 03:55:34.514]  Bezos is making a billion dollars every two days off the scams he runs and government funding.
[03:55:34.514 --> 03:55:37.256]  The Washington Post is literally the enemy of this country.
[03:55:37.256 --> 03:55:38.617]  Because we keep being reasonable.
[03:55:38.617 --> 03:55:38.777]  Right.
[03:55:38.777 --> 03:55:43.321]  You know, we keep just kind of looking at the facts and the evidence and, oh, debating this and polishing that.
[03:55:43.321 --> 03:55:48.745]  The globalists are absolutely in total war against the recovery, against the president, against all of us.
[03:55:49.085 --> 03:55:49.385]  Yeah.
[03:55:49.385 --> 03:55:53.507]  No more just sitting there like pundits analyzing this.
[03:55:53.507 --> 03:55:55.947]  And James O'Keefe hit it on the head.
[03:55:55.947 --> 03:55:58.468]  They use the word S-H-I-T-T-Y.
[03:55:58.468 --> 03:55:59.709]  Because we can't do that.
[03:55:59.709 --> 03:56:01.469]  We're not upper class elite liberals.
[03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:04.070]  They're allowed to say it because it's a documentary and they're okay.
[03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.630]  We can't.
[03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:06.631]  And then three hours later they come out with the same thing.
[03:56:06.631 --> 03:56:07.591]  Oh, Trump said this.
[03:56:07.591 --> 03:56:08.292]  Who do we have?
[03:56:08.292 --> 03:56:11.613]  We have people, according to people familiar with their reactions.
[03:56:12.466 --> 03:56:14.187]  Those people weren't even in the meeting!
[03:56:14.187 --> 03:56:16.969]  According to people familiar with their... People in the meeting say they didn't say it!
[03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:18.870]  Of course they're lying garbage!
[03:56:18.870 --> 03:56:21.632]  They film people that only want social media power.
[03:56:21.632 --> 03:56:26.094]  They get the dopamine of getting promoted so they don't care what the truth is.
[03:56:26.094 --> 03:56:28.276]  There could be a cure for death.
[03:56:28.276 --> 03:56:29.557]  These people don't want it.
[03:56:29.557 --> 03:56:33.939]  They have chosen people in these things that are literally pure scum.
[03:56:33.939 --> 03:56:37.081]  And so some say the answer is leave Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[03:56:37.081 --> 03:56:37.942]  And I agree.
[03:56:37.942 --> 03:56:39.663]  The president needs to break it up
[03:56:40.223 --> 03:56:48.527]  Google, Facebook, and Twitter are a greater threat than Hitler who wanted to conquer the world because they're scientific, they're committed, they're evil, they're using psychology.
[03:56:48.527 --> 03:56:49.688]  So I agree.
[03:56:49.688 --> 03:56:51.969]  It's now time to shut down Google.
[03:56:51.969 --> 03:56:53.349]  They want to shut our speech down?
[03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:54.150]  It just hit me.
[03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.410]  Fine!
[03:56:55.322 --> 03:57:01.026]  It is time to have congressional hearings and all of it and not just break it up.
[03:57:01.026 --> 03:57:08.331]  It's time for Google, Facebook, Twitter and all these groups as criminal international crime syndicates with everybody's personal data.
[03:57:08.331 --> 03:57:14.655]  We're going to break next Monday, sharing our photos, our videos, turning our cameras on, recording it as intelligence agencies.
[03:57:14.655 --> 03:57:22.580]  It's time for Facebook, Google, Twitter to be shut down as criminal operations, just like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[03:57:22.580 --> 03:57:25.102]  It is time to shut them down.
[03:57:29.144 --> 03:57:32.025]  All right, that's going to do it for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:32.025 --> 03:57:33.766]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[03:57:33.766 --> 03:57:38.808]  Now Roger Stone is going to be coming up next on The War Room with a lot of bombshell information.
