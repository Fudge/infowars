[00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.970]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:46.227 --> 00:01:00.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, the 14th day of February 2018, Valentine's Day.
[00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:09.549]  And if you're a TV viewer, I have my little valentine to all of you that I've decided to tweet out here in the next 10-15 minutes at relalexjones.
[00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.911]  Document cam shot please.
[00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:20.728]  And it's got President Trump in a tuxedo, pointing his finger, saying, I want you on my side of the wall.
[00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:21.789]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:31.581]  That reminds me of one of the Blaze chicklets named Allie, one of the teleprompter readers, but she says some decent stuff over there.
[00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:44.824]  And I noticed that she has this whole thing, as I was sent this by one of my crew members this morning, about how I'm going to say something really radical and that something you're not supposed to say, but we should celebrate, you know, male masculinity and it's something we need.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:01.372]  I'm so sick of everybody harping to Hollywood and the mental patient facilities that are in control of the universities and other areas and then we respond to it like we're radical standing up against it.
[00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.275]  They're the radicals and Tucker Carlson
[00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:07.740]  Totally and completely gets this.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.107]  He came out and said, why is CNN, this is something I've pointed out many times, why is... I was meaning to make this point yesterday and he made it last night.
[00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:19.150]  Not like we're plagiarizing each other, we're in the zeitgeist.
[00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.855]  Why are CNN and all the train stations and all the airports?
[00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.557]  Because they pay to be there.
[00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:47.654]  And that's why the crappiest food that nobody else wants to eat anymore, except I guess the President, because he's a throwback in a good way, McDonald's, is all you can find at a lot of these road stops that are in the middle of the highway, in places like Oklahoma and Kansas and other areas, from back from the time that they walled off the exits to the little towns, because I guess they couldn't pay the state off or whatever, that's how that worked.
[00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:48.494]  And so,
[00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.454]  It's illustrative of how they're trying to look like they're the establishment.
[00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:19.278]  They're trying to look like they are the standard.
[00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:27.587]  But it'd be like the old Soviet Union in the 1970s picking up a copy of Pravda and going, oh look, it's on all the newsstands.
[00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.429]  Because it's being shoveled at you.
[00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:35.014]  And I know the listeners and audience get this, but people like
[00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:40.998]  This Allie chick, who I guess like a year ago, we invited on the show once, she's like, oh, I wouldn't be involved with you.
[00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:43.140]  I was already going to come on air and make that point today.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.583]  And when I gave them the clip, they said, oh, that's kind of a teleprompter reading person that, you know, thinks they're above InfoWars.
[00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.286]  And I said, that's the point I'm even going to make without even knowing who she is.
[00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:53.827]  I could watch it.
[00:03:53.827 --> 00:03:54.968]  Didn't even know she was.
[00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.109]  They were trying to set her up for the show.
[00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.592]  I was going to make the point that this is the, this is why we may not win the fight.
[00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:07.415]  Because we're here like, oh my gosh, they said families are bad, but hey, we're radical, we're saying they're okay.
[00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:09.095]  No, they're the radicals.
[00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:18.539]  That's totally cult-like to have the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, all yesterday, it's all a talking point, say best friends are bad, families are bad.
[00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:25.462]  They're now admitting their plan, but saying it authoritatively, like we're supposed to grovel and say, oh, you're right.
[00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:27.303]  Stop your man-spreading, stop your
[00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.480]  It's ridiculous.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.581]  Ignore all of it.
[00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.042]  Who cares what these people think?
[00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:35.604]  Who cares about their bullying?
[00:04:35.604 --> 00:04:46.892]  I wouldn't be as successful as I was if all these other people that have come and gone figured out people want authenticity and being real and being hardcore and being genuine.
[00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:55.377]  So thank God, I guess, in the competition of media that all these ding-dings like Glenn Beck, who's failing, and his minions don't even get what America wants.
[00:04:55.377 --> 00:04:57.299]  They bet on Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.487]  MycoZx is back!

[00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:01.298]  We've got it.
[00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:07.804]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:12.208]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:17.833]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:37.884]  There is a point that I don't make enough here before I get into all the masses of critical and quite frankly earth-shaking, riveting information.
[00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:42.347]  And it's that so many people want to be part of the establishment.
[00:06:42.347 --> 00:06:45.068]  They want to be at the coolest part of the country club.
[00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:48.330]  They want to have the biggest house on the hill.
[00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.033]  They want to be part of the coolest organizations.
[00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:54.014]  They want to walk the red carpet.
[00:06:54.787 --> 00:07:07.735]  It's a whole cottage industry in every town and city to have little red carpets and little award ceremonies and little events where people go fawning, wanting to feel like they've arrived in the cool part of society.
[00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:10.917]  And that's a natural function of humanity and it's good to honor people.
[00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:19.021]  You know, for serious things they've done, like graduating, or donating to the poor, or inventing vital things.
[00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:33.289]  But it's become an artificiality that's used to control us and direct us by the system, celebrating these grand falloons, to quote a famous literary genius.
[00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:53.581]  They become these big ridiculous things that are meant to just be advertising to celebrate our own enslavement and to make us enjoy being part of the whole servitude-based system that Kurt Vonnegut and others wrote so eloquently against.
[00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:55.969]  On what I'd call the true left.
[00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:02.791]  The modern left is the exact opposite of what the left under Thomas Jefferson or somebody like Kurt Vonnegut would actually be.
[00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:06.432]  So again, all these terms are interchangeable and completely twisted.
[00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:16.455]  But what we must do is scientifically and empirically study the real political systems of the world and then develop our own terms for them.
[00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:21.016]  I began calling things about 18 years ago neo-feudalistic fascism.
[00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:41.137]  And now you see that term is in popular use, even in university published papers, and I see it everywhere, that the globalists have set up a new form of neo-feudalism, a new form of corporate colonialism, another term I've used, coined, over
[00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:43.838]  The population of the entire globe.
[00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:56.248]  They exploit the third world and then weaponize them politically with globalist prepackaged propaganda for their area to then make them hate the West, make them want to invade the West, and then have incentives for them to invade the West.
[00:08:56.248 --> 00:08:58.510]  Free housing, health care, you name it.
[00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:14.019]  To then use them as the new subgroup to drive down wages, drive cultural divides, and then bring in a large police state to protect the indigenous population from the new client state group that has been brought in to be a state within a state.
[00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:15.079]  This is all part of the...
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:16.840]  We're good to go.
[00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:52.322]  So everything else must be sabotaged with the psychological warfare programs, with the computer algorithms, with the fast trading systems that game every system, turning what was casinos into absolute invincible frauds in the final equation.
[00:09:52.322 --> 00:10:01.326]  Trump has attempted to sabotage that and direct that huge cornucopia of wealth, at least partially, back at the people, and that has been the great crime that he has committed.
[00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:02.086]  So that said,
[00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:08.918]  So many people want to tune into what they think is the establishment.
[00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:14.644]  And they want to tune into what is basically being aired in the airports.
[00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:17.526]  And that's not cool.
[00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:19.888]  CNN is uncool all over the world.
[00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:24.752]  Their ratings have gone from low to basically not even existent.
[00:10:24.752 --> 00:10:29.757]  But they still pay large amounts of money to be in those
[00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:37.486]  Government and corporate control facilities to have the look that they're ubiquitous.
[00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:38.608]  They're the bottom line.
[00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:41.310]  They're the real news because they're the fake news.
[00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:50.320]  But I've seen Jake Tapper, when he attacked me just a few weeks ago, he said InfoWars is a terrible, and they looked down at his notes, said terrible news organization.
[00:10:52.278 --> 00:10:55.259]  He didn't want to say fake news because they first tried to launch that.
[00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:56.540]  It blew up in their face.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:07.826]  So you notice they'll have a satellite cut out or they'll cut out a Trump speech or they'll cut a congressman off if they say fake news because it damaged them so much and invokes memories of everything they've done.
[00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:09.787]  And this is the key.
[00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:12.168]  This is Gruber said, thank God you don't have memories.
[00:11:12.168 --> 00:11:13.869]  Thank God you're so effing stupid.
[00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:18.071]  Thank God you have the memory of a goldfish and don't remember they were going to double and triple prices on you.
[00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:21.130]  Thank God you're so stupid.
[00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.412]  Zuckerberg said that too.
[00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:25.074]  You're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:11:25.074 --> 00:11:27.577]  Now why do I raise that again?
[00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:33.664]  Because if you have a memory
[00:11:34.684 --> 00:11:34.864]  I don't
[00:11:51.448 --> 00:12:09.037]  Real realignment and discredit it, you discredit the voters themselves and say they're idiots, influenced by the Russians, but more importantly, you change the subject of the fake polls and the rigged debates that all came out in WikiLeaks and the almost three million dollars that couldn't beat five hundred million dollars.
[00:12:09.037 --> 00:12:14.100]  And the entire political and pundit and polling and political system knowing
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.600]  It's out.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.581]  It failed.
[00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:18.841]  It's over.
[00:12:18.841 --> 00:12:20.282]  They've lost control.
[00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:21.302]  They're not worth working.
[00:12:21.302 --> 00:12:22.862]  They're not worth being hired.
[00:12:22.862 --> 00:12:27.984]  They've got to go prove they can beat the American people back into submission.
[00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:34.366]  They've got to prove they can beat the Scots and the Brits back into submission with the Brexit.
[00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:44.270]  They've got to prove they can beat the Catalonians back into submission, and the French, and the Spanish, and everybody else, and the Brazilians, and the list goes on and on.
[00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.950]  But they can't.
[00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.853]  So they move on to culture war, race war, all this other stuff, and it's all failing.
[00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:59.177]  But remember, we all should not just sit here and defend against the Russian narrative, which is this phony $3 bill.
[00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:02.119]  Yes, we should defend against it, but only with a modicum.
[00:13:03.403 --> 00:13:14.348]  With a moderate little slices, just laugh at it, then discredit each piece and move on, instead of it being the giant narrative, even responding to it, because that gives them the power.
[00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:16.469]  We have the power as the independent new media.
[00:13:16.469 --> 00:13:17.390]  We have the audience.
[00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.190]  You are the people.
[00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.211]  You have the audience.
[00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:21.672]  You have the common sense, the light, the dark of the night.
[00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:23.513]  Why are we obsessing over it so much?
[00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:32.257]  Why do we live to cover every angle of this soap opera, baking us a slave of the fraud they created, instead of going, oh, they brought up Russiagate because
[00:13:32.637 --> 00:13:38.480]  They don't want you to see five clips of Democrats we're about to show you years ago saying the exact same thing Trump said on immigration.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.101]  Or they don't want you to remember them crying on election night.
[00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:42.942]  Well, let's show some of that.
[00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:44.783]  Or they don't want you to remember their fake polls.
[00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.424]  Or they don't want you to remember them calling for world government.
[00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:53.960]  Or they don't want you to remember Hillary calling black super predators that must be brought like dogs to heal.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.105]  Or Africans being told they can't have cars or air conditioning and they're being globally sabotaged.
[00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:12.138]  You see, we must take control of the narrative that there's a planetary corporate world government dictating an end to the family and everyone being run by AI computers and a hellish world that's already been decided.
[00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.532]  We have to do that.
[00:14:18.532 --> 00:14:20.213]  And I have failed.
[00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:23.896]  I knew this a year and a half ago, and I knew it today.
[00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:30.100]  And I said they're creating their whole false narrative where even if we respond to it, we lose.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.880]  You're ready with Tucker Carlson.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.701]  I'm going to play that club.
[00:14:32.836 --> 00:14:36.459]  And so now, here we are, deep into the fake narrative.
[00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.982]  They're failing in their overall story, but it doesn't matter.
[00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:47.109]  They distracted us into Russia world, which was their plan to begin with, instead of this, from Tucker Carlson, exposing how they're frauds.
[00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:47.430]  Here it is.
[00:14:48.319 --> 00:14:50.841]  If you've ever been to an American airport, you may have noticed something.
[00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:52.662]  Everyone's watching CNN.
[00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:53.643]  They don't have a choice.
[00:14:53.643 --> 00:15:10.514]  Well, that may have made sense 20 years ago when CNN had a centrist reputation, but these days the channel has strayed so far to the left and is constantly proponing wacky Russia-related conspiracy theories, along with strange spiritual advice from resident philosopher-poet Chris Cuomo, you gotta wonder what's going on.
[00:15:10.894 --> 00:15:17.299]  Airports feel like a lesser version of hell with dirty seats, overpriced food, and propaganda posing as news on CNN.
[00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:21.962]  So why is this network, this channel, in every airport in America?
[00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:29.568]  We decided to find out, in a surprisingly large number of cases, the reason is that CNN is literally paying to have you watch them.
[00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:32.130]  CNN has a special package called CNN Airport.
[00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.172]  It combines news, sports, and travel.
[00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:37.354]  In at least 60 airports, CNN has signed agreements to show the channel.
[00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.335]  In Miami, for example,
[00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:43.401]  CNN Airport pays the airport authority a minimum of 150 grand a year.
[00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:52.932]  In Minneapolis, the airport authorities there told us, quote, CNN covers the costs related to the TVs and infrastructure and pays us for the opportunity to be in our facility.
[00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:56.676]  Which raises the question, how much would you have to be paid to watch CNN?
[00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:01.236]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:30.915]  Hear that?
[00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:36.296]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:39.197]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:08.631]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:16.997]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:17.485]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:22.648]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:36.638]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.638 --> 00:18:43.642]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.642 --> 00:18:47.585]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:51.870]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:19:09.344 --> 00:19:20.191]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:22.313]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:19:22.313 --> 00:19:26.295]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:33.560]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.942]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:38.584]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:19:38.584 --> 00:19:39.184]  That's my dad.
[00:19:39.504 --> 00:19:40.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:30.590]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.230]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:38.853]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.853 --> 00:20:50.778]  You know, I've learned how the globalists roll stuff out, and I've just sat there every day looking at hundreds of news articles and watching hundreds of different news reports or boildowns of how they operate.
[00:20:52.003 --> 00:21:03.472]  And we've always known what their plan is for about 20 years with smart appliances and smart homes to totally surveil us and totally control us.
[00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:08.636]  And we even knew how they were going to try to get us to accept it.
[00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:19.585]  Now, about four years ago, the terms of service with smart TVs, that's any TV you buy, told you to watch what you say and do, you're being watched.
[00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:20.806]  This happened over the weekend.
[00:21:21.937 --> 00:21:26.580]  We're not going to go to it yet until the bottom of the next hour.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.044]  And it is exactly how you would think they would do it right out of a science fiction movie.
[00:21:32.044 --> 00:21:45.894]  How are they going to roll out that your television, not just with a camera or microphone already embedded, but how are you going to roll it out to announce to everybody they're being watched inside their houses?
[00:21:48.427 --> 00:21:53.050]  By their Kinect systems, by their PlayStations, by the TV itself, by the TV screen.
[00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:06.218]  Because they have the patents and the new TV screens just put a little diode chip in and then it uses the screen itself like a chip that's picking up light for HD video and photos.
[00:22:06.218 --> 00:22:09.580]  They rolled it out over the weekend.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.641]  And a listener pointed it out.
[00:22:11.641 --> 00:22:14.283]  And so we're going to put a big article together on this.
[00:22:14.283 --> 00:22:17.405]  We've already got the video and the intel.
[00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:22.956]  And it's coming up, bottom of the next hour, maybe the next hour.
[00:22:22.956 --> 00:22:26.437]  There you go.
[00:22:26.437 --> 00:22:29.178]  We're putting on screen for TV viewers.
[00:22:29.178 --> 00:22:30.538]  Just give me a minute.
[00:22:30.538 --> 00:22:31.579]  Print it all for me.
[00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:40.161]  Because I knew this was coming out, and Rob Dew ran in earlier before the show and brought it up to me, and we're collating all the data just so we'll be spot on when we give it to you.
[00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:42.082]  Because they're going to roll this out.
[00:22:42.082 --> 00:22:43.022]  This was a beta test.
[00:22:44.804 --> 00:22:47.266]  They're going to see what people do and how they respond.
[00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:56.031]  And then they're going to ratchet up the propaganda and have somebody down the road announce from mainstream news, you know, this is no big deal.
[00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:57.032]  This is a fun new thing.
[00:22:57.032 --> 00:23:05.757]  But by the way, it's not just that your Alexa or your Siri is watching and listening to you and saying, watch your mouth.
[00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:06.958]  Everything is watching you.
[00:23:08.203 --> 00:23:11.424]  There it is, CIA turns Samsung Smart TVs into listening devices.
[00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:13.124]  WikiLeaks dump reveals.
[00:23:13.124 --> 00:23:14.745]  And that was last year we reported that.
[00:23:14.745 --> 00:23:17.705]  We first reported it to Samsung four years ago.
[00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:19.006]  Had it in their terms of service.
[00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:20.686]  It's not just Samsung.
[00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:21.766]  This is ubiquitous.
[00:23:21.766 --> 00:23:22.867]  But let's stop right there.
[00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:27.668]  Yeah, go ahead and print me all those articles so I can give people some context.
[00:23:27.668 --> 00:23:32.129]  But we are... We are...
[00:23:33.737 --> 00:23:48.106]  The world leader in exposing this AI takeover, because the AI's eyes, ears, nose, fingers, you know, it's touch, is all the technology.
[00:23:48.106 --> 00:24:02.495]  And it's not that technology's bad, it's that it's been designed and is being rolled out to predict what we're going to do, control our lives, and be able to manipulate stimula, the stimulus,
[00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:07.760]  So that we are totally programmable.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.642]  The globalists have decided we don't have free will.
[00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:12.064]  They say they do because they're ascendant.
[00:24:12.064 --> 00:24:19.253]  We don't have free will and so from birth they're trying to keep us from ever being somewhat self-aware and becoming conscious.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.542]  You know, all the ancients and all the leaders and all the spiritual folks were trying to attain higher consciousness.
[00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:31.604]  The entire globalist system is about suppressing higher consciousness.
[00:24:31.604 --> 00:24:42.768]  And I'm just here going, uh, hey, NSA whistleblowers came to me 20 years ago because nobody else was covering this and said, kid, you want to know what's going on?
[00:24:42.768 --> 00:24:45.449]  And told me everything.
[00:24:45.449 --> 00:24:49.411]  And I went on air and told you everything before I even had documents.
[00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:49.531]  And
[00:24:50.913 --> 00:24:52.274]  You know who that got me as an audience?
[00:24:52.274 --> 00:24:55.057]  The CIA, the Pentagon.
[00:24:55.057 --> 00:25:15.835]  That was suddenly when my audience got big, was when the government agencies started all listening, and then they'd go home and buy my products at night, like police chiefs and CIA deputy directors, and you've heard the stories from dev group SEALs and everybody else here about how they didn't know what was going on until 15 years ago in a secret operation, the CIA section chief said, listen, you gotta listen to Alex Jones.
[00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:21.389]  He knows what's going on, and it wasn't because I was that smart.
[00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:28.472]  I was just an uncontrolled guy on talk radio that was on, you know, 30, 40 stations or so, back when I was 25 years old.
[00:25:28.472 --> 00:25:36.956]  I was on 100 stations by the time I was 27, and I'd talk about it.
[00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:46.499]  So pretty soon I had engineers showing up, the parking lot going, here's the plans, and here's the Scientific Atlantic cable box, break it open son.
[00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:49.461]  There'd be, you see that camera, you see that microphone?
[00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:52.804]  First it was a microphone, they said they're about to put cameras in it in two years.
[00:25:52.804 --> 00:25:54.826]  Here's the port for the camera.
[00:25:56.479 --> 00:26:04.468]  He says it'll be 10 years before this is even used, but it's being used now for market research just to set the precedent that everything's being surveilled illegally.
[00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:07.692]  Now, see, back then I went and told people that, and the media flipped out.
[00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:10.355]  I had people come and physically attack me, death threats.
[00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:13.138]  I mean, it was like, boy, we're gonna kill you.
[00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:13.999]  You keep talking about this.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.061]  Because back then, something could have been done.
[00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:19.164]  It would have shocked Congress, or shocked the local state legislators.
[00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:19.945]  Let's do something!
[00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.706]  Why are there hidden cameras and microphones?
[00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:24.809]  You know, in 1997, this is incredible!
[00:26:24.809 --> 00:26:25.710]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.730]  The whole country woke up!
[00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.651]  We didn't allow it!
[00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:28.252]  But instead...
[00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:34.376]  They just made fun of it, and made fun of it, and made fun of it, till it's everywhere now.
[00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:45.827]  Just like CNBC said, well, at the World Government Summit, where corporations were making agreements on the future of the planet, the decision was made that all humans will merge with machines for the betterment of the carbon footprint.
[00:26:45.827 --> 00:26:48.590]  That's what the full report, not just CNBC, if you go actually read what they wrote.
[00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:56.295]  And then, you know, a decade later, the CIA director goes, okay, your appliance is watching you, big deal.
[00:26:56.295 --> 00:27:05.522]  And a couple of years later, Amazon goes, you know, 99% of the time when you're a Prime member, we can guess exactly what you're doing before we even order it.
[00:27:05.522 --> 00:27:09.325]  And then, oh, Samsung Smart TV records personal conversations and sends them to third parties.
[00:27:09.325 --> 00:27:10.006]  Can you imagine?
[00:27:10.006 --> 00:27:18.693]  You've got admitted bugs in your house, recording everything you're doing with endless bandwidth on bandwidths you're paying for.
[00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:23.335]  Collating it all.
[00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:31.696]  But everybody now knows I was right, but I'm still the bad guy and I'm even kookier, see?
[00:27:31.696 --> 00:27:35.577]  Like if I was a prospector and I said, I found a comstock mine.
[00:27:35.577 --> 00:27:39.278]  It's probably got 50 tons of gold in it.
[00:27:39.278 --> 00:27:43.559]  Everybody goes and gets in there and they go, it's got 50 tons of gold.
[00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:45.239]  It's like, let's kill that old man.
[00:27:45.239 --> 00:27:47.200]  He, he, he steered us wrong.
[00:27:51.647 --> 00:27:54.590]  Well, you're not telling us good news like about gold, you're telling us about bad news.
[00:27:54.590 --> 00:28:01.675]  No, it was gold for your family and gold for the future of the country and the world if we had done something about this.
[00:28:01.675 --> 00:28:03.417]  And it wasn't me that did it.
[00:28:03.417 --> 00:28:08.021]  It was the engineers.
[00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:15.607]  You know, I had two other times, I had sons of former NSA and corporate guys, AT&T, Time Warner.
[00:28:17.288 --> 00:28:21.833]  Once I had a son come to me, and I used to do events a few times a year, people could come talk to me.
[00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.296]  He said, you remember my dad coming to see me about 10 years ago?
[00:28:26.933 --> 00:28:28.575]  Uh, he described him and everything.
[00:28:28.575 --> 00:28:30.656]  You guys met in the parking garage where you were at.
[00:28:30.656 --> 00:28:33.719]  And I said, yeah, he said, yeah, my dad died about two weeks after that.
[00:28:33.719 --> 00:28:36.180]  Just so you know, they killed him, but I'm glad he did it.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.941]  And let me tell you more.
[00:28:36.941 --> 00:28:39.383]  He told me before he died and he was telling me everything.
[00:28:39.383 --> 00:28:40.884]  It's about trends and future things.
[00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:42.665]  They can see it and control it, know it.
[00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:45.608]  And they've already, they're going to put, they're putting nanotech already in the food.
[00:28:45.608 --> 00:28:47.069]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.299]  And they got big corporations involved in it, like Starbucks, and I'm just like, whoa, whoa.
[00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:54.663]  I mean, folks, we're not in Kansas.
[00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:56.687]  We're in a super advanced technology already.
[00:28:59.807 --> 00:29:00.608]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:02.429]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:02.429 --> 00:29:04.070]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.892]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[00:30:02.256 --> 00:30:20.644]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:30:20.644 --> 00:30:26.926]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:28.047]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:30:28.047 --> 00:30:30.888]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[00:30:31.548 --> 00:30:33.069]  And so much more.
[00:30:33.069 --> 00:30:34.430]  It is concentrated.
[00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.250]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:41.973]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.194]  A citrus peel blend.

[00:30:45.195 --> 00:30:47.796]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:49.217]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:30:49.217 --> 00:30:51.598]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:52.298]  Immune Wall.
[00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:53.739]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:31:00.237 --> 00:31:03.721]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:15.235]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[00:31:15.235 --> 00:31:16.116]  This is pollen blood.
[00:31:17.117 --> 00:31:29.781]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:34.103]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[00:31:34.103 --> 00:31:38.124]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet.
[00:31:38.584 --> 00:31:48.673]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.796]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[00:32:00.063 --> 00:32:03.484]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:07.445]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:10.786]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:32:10.786 --> 00:32:13.326]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:18.048]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:32:18.048 --> 00:32:20.408]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:32:20.408 --> 00:32:26.810]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:35.613]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:35.613 --> 00:32:40.674]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:32:40.674 --> 00:32:47.637]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:32:48.297 --> 00:32:53.201]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:56.063]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:56.063 --> 00:32:57.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:30.010]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:43.554]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to present to you first, on air,
[00:33:45.999 --> 00:34:09.627]  That the announcement is set to be made imminently that all new televisions, and the technology is already going into basically everything, will have the screens themselves being the camera chip and will videotape you digitally and take photos of you in live time.
[00:34:09.627 --> 00:34:11.028]  You'll be unable to turn them off.
[00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:20.269]  We're going to get to all the documentation claims coming up next hour.
[00:34:20.269 --> 00:34:23.912]  And the reason I go over that is Media Matters and George Soros will take just that part.
[00:34:23.912 --> 00:34:25.733]  They won't show any documentation.
[00:34:25.733 --> 00:34:29.876]  And they'll say I made it up even though it's set to be announced.
[00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:33.559]  And the reason I know that is I know how their algorithm operates.
[00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:43.728]  They made the announcement over the weekend during a major sport event as a beta test.
[00:34:45.137 --> 00:34:54.884]  And then they will, generally within a month, make the announcement to the world.
[00:34:54.884 --> 00:35:00.828]  But then they'll say, did ESPN screw up telling you about it?
[00:35:00.828 --> 00:35:08.534]  They always make it about, oh, TiVo admits that they rewound and replayed a record number of Janet Jackson's breasts popping out.
[00:35:09.818 --> 00:35:13.980]  Was it right that they told you they're listening and watching what you do and tracking it?
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.581]  But that's just digitally.
[00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:23.345]  And then of course if they don't like episodes of TV programs I'm on, they admittedly go in and erase them off your DVRs.
[00:35:23.345 --> 00:35:24.225]  Now there it is.
[00:35:24.225 --> 00:35:27.567]  Jackson's stunt most replayed moment ever.
[00:35:27.567 --> 00:35:29.228]  CNN.
[00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:31.729]  But then, that in 2004 became the controversy
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.492]  Of, oh, does that scare you that we're watching everything you do?
[00:35:40.492 --> 00:35:42.153]  Well, it's beyond that.
[00:35:42.153 --> 00:35:43.533]  You'll say, I don't care if you watch me.
[00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:47.815]  They use the data against you.
[00:35:47.815 --> 00:35:56.898]  So they're just slowly rolling this out, slowly having discussions about it.
[00:35:56.898 --> 00:35:59.299]  And they admit there's no turning it off.
[00:35:59.299 --> 00:36:00.019]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:36:01.187 --> 00:36:05.048]  All the new modern televisions and many other appliances are watching you.
[00:36:05.048 --> 00:36:12.389]  It's the screen itself, and you can't turn it off, and they admit they're spying on you, and they're using it against you.
[00:36:12.389 --> 00:36:17.030]  But everybody's so in love with the screen sickness, down with the sickness, what are they gonna do?
[00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:25.591]  But we've got the video, not just of them announcing it, but it inside your house.
[00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:27.712]  Don't show it yet.
[00:36:27.712 --> 00:36:30.092]  Inside your house, watching you.
[00:36:32.534 --> 00:36:34.355]  When you don't know.
[00:36:34.355 --> 00:36:36.576]  And it's all done as cute and fun.
[00:36:36.576 --> 00:36:39.458]  And next it'll be the sports fans you know.
[00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:47.882]  Oh look, let's tune into the Johnsons or the Changs house or the Smiths house or the Sanchez's house.
[00:36:47.882 --> 00:36:50.944]  And then oh look, they're on the couch, yay!
[00:36:50.944 --> 00:36:55.547]  And no matter what you do, oh we're just gonna look in your house now.
[00:36:55.547 --> 00:37:01.230]  But it's all done in your face.
[00:37:02.765 --> 00:37:07.892]  Now, I don't want to get sidetracked with that, but it is a big announcement.
[00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:14.863]  And again, they want to just slip it out during sports shows and go, oh, look there, your TV watches you.
[00:37:14.863 --> 00:37:16.966]  That's a fancy new fun thing.
[00:37:16.966 --> 00:37:18.989]  Look, the folks getting watched are happy about it.
[00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.091]  And it's a new technology.
[00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:22.772]  It's always the newest thing.
[00:37:22.772 --> 00:37:25.334]  Why, they told folks going to a death camp was the newest thing.
[00:37:25.334 --> 00:37:26.374]  People would line up for it.
[00:37:26.374 --> 00:37:28.116]  Or have an autonomous car.
[00:37:28.116 --> 00:37:30.457]  It tracks everything you go and taxes you by the mile.
[00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:33.599]  But only the fanciest Audis and Mercedes have it.
[00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:38.282]  Well, let me line up to get that!
[00:37:38.282 --> 00:37:48.449]  And it's all purposely directed and organized to tax you, to control you, to make you desperate, to make you alone, to make you obsolete.
[00:37:51.618 --> 00:37:55.141]  The New York Times.
[00:37:55.141 --> 00:38:00.645]  It's fascinating to ban best friends and maybe even friendship itself.
[00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.606]  That's how we'll make people happy.
[00:38:02.606 --> 00:38:07.230]  Don't go outdoors, don't have friends, don't have contact sports.
[00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.193]  Just look at your phone and then you get the internal documents in there like
[00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:26.434]  Fifteen years ago, right when Facebook's getting launched, our mission is to keep them within a contained system, to keep them depressed, to keep them desperate, and only interacting with our bots and our systems in phase one.
[00:38:26.434 --> 00:38:33.519]  In phase two, we'll then phase out really most human activity and real contact and phase in mainly bots.
[00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:40.612]  Then we'll phase out third-party advertising and only advertise goods and services that vertically integrate our control system.
[00:38:40.612 --> 00:38:44.153]  I'm paraphrasing with documents, they're public, came out last year.
[00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:51.535]  And then finally, we will phase out products all along the line and only allow them to have the products we want for
[00:38:52.583 --> 00:39:03.868]  Social engineering towards the larger goals of our unified program under the Transnational Agreements, TPP, IMF, World Bank, WTO Agreements, and then it lists them.
[00:39:03.868 --> 00:39:10.691]  It is all in board meetings with the top technicians, the top engineers, the top psych warfare people.
[00:39:11.551 --> 00:39:16.974]  And they create a private global government secret combine that you're going to live under.
[00:39:16.974 --> 00:39:20.836]  And we're already 14 phases that I know of into these things.
[00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:23.957]  They have meetings every two to three years to finish their systems.
[00:39:23.957 --> 00:39:35.943]  They've got four or five competing world government models, but are run by the same people only to see which one's working the best to then finally merge what works best in all of the systems together into the super grid.
[00:39:35.943 --> 00:39:38.264]  I mean, you're getting the actual plan right now.
[00:39:40.322 --> 00:39:45.143]  And see, why does all this other news matter when you know the master plan?
[00:39:45.143 --> 00:39:47.424]  But then you've got to ask, who do they get to run it?
[00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:59.027]  Well, communist Chinese, they found, are the most godless, bloodthirsty, cold about it, and will just do whatever they're told and actually have a fetish to kill their own people.
[00:39:59.027 --> 00:40:06.608]  So, I mean, they patented putting people in slave cages and shelling them around the world 500 years ago.
[00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:12.914]  It's unbelievable.
[00:40:12.914 --> 00:40:16.838]  So, that's why the Vatican has come out and said they are the model of human rights.
[00:40:16.838 --> 00:40:19.601]  They are the epitome of goodness and decency.
[00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:21.603]  That was the Pope yesterday in a big announcement.
[00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:24.286]  China, best example of church's social doctrine.
[00:40:24.286 --> 00:40:26.108]  Beijing, defends human dignity.
[00:40:26.108 --> 00:40:26.748]  The Pope says.
[00:40:27.745 --> 00:40:39.076]  And I thought you'd want to know about that because every day or so we see another Catholic priest, including the Deputy Pope, indicted for trafficking more than 100 small boys, some of which were found dead.
[00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:40.978]  This is out of the Idaho Statesman.
[00:40:40.978 --> 00:40:45.943]  Hundreds of child porn images, LSD, ecstasy found in Boise priest's home.
[00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.886]  Prosecutor says, but that's not the issue.
[00:40:48.886 --> 00:40:50.027]  The headline should be.
[00:40:52.998 --> 00:41:02.780]  This retired senior priest talked in message boards about his desires to rape and kill children that he would kidnap.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:08.261]  And of course, you dig deeper into the situation, you'll find more.
[00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:20.844]  And that ties into this report about the top Democrat donor in California with all these witnesses saying he gets black men that are not on drugs, gets them on drugs just to see them dehumanized and desperate.
[00:41:22.611 --> 00:41:25.416]  And then they die.
[00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:30.064]  They found one guy, a young man, dead at his house and they've got the diaries and it's all very, very sad.
[00:41:30.064 --> 00:41:33.149]  And again, you have to understand with the left...
[00:41:34.776 --> 00:41:37.517]  Sucking a soul is their God.
[00:41:37.517 --> 00:41:41.780]  And if you can take somebody, and they're so anti-black, I don't know what it is.
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.921]  They're always getting caught shipping black kids out of Haiti.
[00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:45.722]  They particularly like them.
[00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:50.524]  There was the Rolling Stones got caught with a dead black Haitian kid back in the 70s in New York.
[00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:52.805]  It's hard to even find that report.
[00:41:52.805 --> 00:41:55.687]  Killed in a voodoo ritual, but it's some weird stuff, man.
[00:41:55.687 --> 00:41:58.448]  And I guess in voodoo, the thing you want's a black.
[00:41:58.448 --> 00:42:03.070]  And if you can't get away with doing sacrifice itself, I'm not saying this nice person with those little rainbow ties doing that.
[00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.171]  I'm just saying that's what goes on.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.542]  This is a big part of it.
[00:42:08.542 --> 00:42:13.105]  You can read about justice for Gamal Moore.
[00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:19.529]  Family wants answers and escorts death at donor's home.
[00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:24.833]  Ed Buck is a well-known Democrat contributor, one of the biggest in California.
[00:42:27.452 --> 00:42:33.198]  And then it goes on, according to a July 31st Coroner's Report, Buck's apartment was riddled with drug paraphernalia, according to items.
[00:42:33.198 --> 00:42:37.242]  24 syringes containing brown residue, 5 glass pipes, it goes on.
[00:42:37.242 --> 00:42:41.526]  And then they've got the witnesses and other black men, and we've got the diaries and all the rest of it.
[00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:47.091]  A number of gay black men have claimed Buck would invite them to his house, then pay them several hundred dollars to take drugs.
[00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:50.434]  He'd like to get them addicted, and then watch them disintegrate.
[00:42:51.255 --> 00:42:52.077]  Uh, and there you have it.
[00:42:52.077 --> 00:42:55.482]  But it's okay because, like Harvey Weinstein, he's liberal.
[00:42:55.482 --> 00:42:57.385]  But see, see, that's who they've got working for them.
[00:42:57.385 --> 00:42:58.106]  That's their army.
[00:42:59.568 --> 00:43:04.493]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:04.493 --> 00:43:10.198]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[00:43:10.198 --> 00:43:13.181]  Now the product is bodies, whole body support.

[00:46:00.185 --> 00:46:02.146]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.466]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:46:03.466 --> 00:46:04.666]  Why is this so good?
[00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:09.948]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:46:09.948 --> 00:46:23.491]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:24.852]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:46:25.652 --> 00:46:27.293]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:46:27.293 --> 00:46:29.854]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:31.174]  These are all parasites.
[00:46:31.174 --> 00:46:32.275]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:46:32.275 --> 00:46:33.615]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:46:33.615 --> 00:46:38.097]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:41.279]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:44.460]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.500]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.321]  Living Defense.
[00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:47.421]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:47.421 --> 00:46:48.442]  And folks, you can't lose.

[00:46:52.023 --> 00:46:53.065]  You support the broadcast.
[00:46:53.065 --> 00:46:54.406]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:46:54.406 --> 00:46:56.669]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:46:56.669 --> 00:47:03.358]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[00:47:03.358 --> 00:47:05.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:33.577]  Remember a few years ago, Ralph Reicherman of the Scorpions said that he'd been at parties where people got killed as part of ritual sacrifice.
[00:47:33.577 --> 00:47:36.619]  He said, well, TMZ took it out of context.
[00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:38.561]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:42.624]  There have been a lot of mysterious deaths in and around Hollywood, rock stars, you name it.
[00:47:42.624 --> 00:47:44.405]  They're constantly catching people under the occult.
[00:47:44.405 --> 00:47:49.089]  There's been all these incredible ritual murders that we've seen that are carried out.
[00:47:49.089 --> 00:47:50.951]  When Charlie Manchin does it for Satan,
[00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:54.514]  We say, oh, he's mentally ill.
[00:47:54.514 --> 00:47:56.757]  Well, of course he's mentally ill.
[00:47:56.757 --> 00:48:02.867]  But these things go on and they try to act like it's a witch hunt and these things don't go on.
[00:48:02.867 --> 00:48:05.511]  Well, it's not Russian interference we have in this country.
[00:48:07.509 --> 00:48:30.641]  It's globalists involved in every aspect of our lives, dehumanizing us, trying to corrupt our children, trying to attack our families, and they're now so out in the open, they're trying to normalize saying, don't say father and mother, don't say Jesus Christ, don't even say you have a family, don't have Trump say family and church during his State of the Union, that that's hateful and bad.
[00:48:32.537 --> 00:48:37.203]  And that Communist China is a great, the best example of human rights, according to the Pope!
[00:48:37.203 --> 00:48:40.166]  It's all sick jokes!
[00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:44.231]  Bringing in 10 million radical Islamists into Europe and letting them do whatever they want!
[00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:46.114]  That's all satanic!
[00:48:48.832 --> 00:48:52.756]  Snopes is out saying, well, the new portrait of the president doesn't have sperm on him.
[00:48:52.756 --> 00:49:01.325]  It looks like sperm painted, but it's, it's, it's, you know, and yes, the artist does paint sperm on some of his other paintings, but the, the, the info wars is wrong.
[00:49:01.325 --> 00:49:02.786]  It's not sperm.
[00:49:02.786 --> 00:49:04.948]  They can't even lying.
[00:49:04.948 --> 00:49:06.810]  They have to admit the truth.
[00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.012]  Let's play a Mr. Mr. Scorpions.
[00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:09.313]  Here it is.
[00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:13.655]  I went to one one time and it seemed really bad.
[00:49:13.655 --> 00:49:15.536]  Was it like a donkey show or?
[00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:20.179]  No, actually, you know, I think they actually kill people there and stuff.
[00:49:20.179 --> 00:49:24.602]  They pay like up to like a hundred thousand people to see people get... Executed?
[00:49:24.602 --> 00:49:25.202]  No, no, no, no.
[00:49:25.202 --> 00:49:30.186]  He paid a hundred thousand dollars to see people killed.
[00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:31.666]  Now, did he really, was he really involved in that?
[00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.348]  Is he trying to be shocking?
[00:49:33.348 --> 00:49:36.369]  The point is... I...
[00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:40.063]  Just, that's not the best version video they found.
[00:49:40.063 --> 00:49:45.066]  We've got a lot better one on Infowars.com, in an article.
[00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:47.707]  Dealing with it, we'll put back on screen so I can give you the headline.
[00:49:47.707 --> 00:49:50.809]  Former Scorpions bass player admits going to stuff parties.
[00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:55.132]  Hostile movie reflects elite murder parties.
[00:49:55.132 --> 00:49:58.074]  Now obviously he tried to backtrack on that one.
[00:49:58.074 --> 00:49:59.415]  The point is, is that
[00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:18.810]  Look at what ISIS is into, murdering hundreds of thousands of people, putting little girls into sex slavery, cutting hearts out, making a bunch of Africans in Libya eat pieces of their dead comrades, believing it will send them to hell.
[00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:26.434]  We've played that video before, right before the election, given to us by intelligence sources.
[00:50:26.434 --> 00:50:28.175]  This is stuff grabbed off satellite feeds.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.601]  I've got hours of it back there.
[00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:32.842]  You want to see ISIS?
[00:50:32.842 --> 00:50:36.744]  If they aren't devil worshippers, I don't know what is.
[00:50:36.744 --> 00:50:38.684]  They're into evil.
[00:50:38.684 --> 00:50:40.765]  They're into pushing boundaries.
[00:50:40.765 --> 00:50:58.454]  Now, if you just joined us, I got into this Catholic priest, retired senior priest, big liberal in the community, who was talking on message boards about how he wanted to kidnap and how he desired to rape and kill children.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.097]  And so they found hundreds of child porn images, LSD, ecstasy, in the priest's home.
[00:51:07.608 --> 00:51:12.769]  And of course, the investigation will probably stop right there, but that's just the daily bust that's going on that I mentioned.
[00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:17.891]  Democrat donors and what people say is going on inside their houses and the dead body that's found and all the rest of it.
[00:51:17.891 --> 00:51:28.873]  But if you're part of the establishment, like Joe Scarborough, and there's a young intern where their brain's bashed out and you're inside your office in the middle of the night, well, there's not even going to be an autopsy here.
[00:51:28.873 --> 00:51:30.354]  We're not even going to look at this.
[00:51:30.354 --> 00:51:31.274]  They called it an autopsy.
[00:51:31.274 --> 00:51:35.215]  They just said, oh, she hit her head.
[00:51:36.963 --> 00:51:41.064]  And so we're going to leave it at that because, see, you're part of the establishment.
[00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:44.125]  You get to not be investigated.
[00:51:44.125 --> 00:51:45.705]  You get to do what you want.
[00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:52.206]  Now, before we go to break, let me tell you what's coming up in the jam-packed next hour.
[00:51:52.206 --> 00:51:59.848]  There's a new Feinstein flashback about how DACA would be a horrible idea and all the common sense reasons it's not good.
[00:52:01.072 --> 00:52:03.232]  And she said it would turn the U.S.
[00:52:03.232 --> 00:52:05.013]  into Mexico's welfare state.
[00:52:05.013 --> 00:52:06.693]  That's what globalism is.
[00:52:06.693 --> 00:52:09.253]  Then we got Bill Clinton's flashback.
[00:52:09.253 --> 00:52:10.414]  Talks about Trump.
[00:52:10.414 --> 00:52:12.554]  We are a nation of laws.
[00:52:12.554 --> 00:52:14.454]  And then I want to tie it into news stories that are out.
[00:52:14.454 --> 00:52:18.115]  EU chief, we need open borders to stop populism.
[00:52:18.115 --> 00:52:20.776]  We're an unelected EU.
[00:52:20.776 --> 00:52:21.556]  We're authoritarian.
[00:52:21.556 --> 00:52:22.416]  We're tax-exempt.
[00:52:22.416 --> 00:52:27.057]  We're run by the heir to the Nazi throne, Juncker.
[00:52:27.057 --> 00:52:28.357]  And so we're going to bring in people
[00:52:29.687 --> 00:52:33.691]  That we're going to let vote to stop the natives from controlling us.
[00:52:33.691 --> 00:52:35.672]  We don't have the votes to make you stay in the dictatorships.
[00:52:35.672 --> 00:52:40.537]  We're going to bring people in, put them on welfare, your money, and pay them to be your enemy.
[00:52:40.537 --> 00:52:42.499]  That's coming up.
[00:52:42.499 --> 00:52:46.502]  We're also going to get into what we told you, what was it, three or four months ago.
[00:52:46.502 --> 00:52:48.704]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:52:48.704 --> 00:52:51.927]  Romney to announce Senate run on social media.
[00:52:51.927 --> 00:52:52.948]  So he is running.
[00:52:52.948 --> 00:52:55.590]  So he can get position and then run against Trump.
[00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.191]  That's coming up.
[00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:01.792]  We also are going to get into Intel Chiefs sound alarm on China's threat.
[00:53:01.792 --> 00:53:02.573]  Yes, they do.
[00:53:02.573 --> 00:53:04.814]  But, oh, the Atlantic.
[00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.275]  Remember we told you this four years ago?
[00:53:06.275 --> 00:53:07.576]  Well, now it's being announced.
[00:53:07.576 --> 00:53:11.118]  China's dystopian tech could be contagious.
[00:53:11.118 --> 00:53:17.041]  Their People's Republic social credit scheme might have consequences for life in cities everywhere.
[00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:18.182]  And they say it's coming here.
[00:53:18.182 --> 00:53:19.062]  You're not a good globalist.
[00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:19.983]  You can't buy or sell.
[00:53:21.192 --> 00:53:22.413]  You can't travel, you can't live.
[00:53:22.413 --> 00:53:23.333]  I think I heard of that before.
[00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:32.639]  And Google tests a smart replay robot, reply robot, that will chat to your friends so you can keep on top of your social life without the effort.
[00:53:32.639 --> 00:53:34.720]  Yes, AI will even wipe your butt for you.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.241]  And you're like, oh, I don't care.
[00:53:37.241 --> 00:53:38.062]  We can use technology.
[00:53:38.062 --> 00:53:39.923]  It's being designed to totally control you.
[00:53:39.923 --> 00:53:41.284]  And of course, this little shmiblet.
[00:53:42.534 --> 00:53:48.679]  Because I've been under Qatari attack for six years.
[00:53:48.679 --> 00:53:59.549]  We've even had, we know, funded Islamic groups out of Qatar, have funded lawsuit campaigns against us behind the scenes, and of course failed, and other things that we'll be able to reveal very, very soon.
[00:53:59.549 --> 00:54:02.071]  The Young Turks were mainly funded by Qatar.
[00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:04.032]  CNN's massively funded by Qatar.
[00:54:05.493 --> 00:54:09.756]  Not anymore, Trump put it into that, but Qatar-backed spy operation on U.S.
[00:54:09.756 --> 00:54:10.216]  Jews.
[00:54:10.216 --> 00:54:14.918]  It's out of the Free Beacon, puts Al Jazeera in congressional crosshairs.
[00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:17.119]  Oh yeah, I've been around Al Jazeera reporters.
[00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:24.763]  They are globalist, leftist, foundation, CIA, Tavistock Institute cutouts.
[00:54:24.763 --> 00:54:25.924]  And so, there you go.
[00:54:25.924 --> 00:54:28.945]  And of course, will American leftist Jews do anything about this?
[00:54:28.945 --> 00:54:30.406]  Probably not.
[00:54:30.406 --> 00:54:31.347]  But there you go.
[00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.596]  Pretty sick.
[00:54:33.596 --> 00:54:36.739]  And we've got economic news, tech news, the volcanic news.
[00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:38.381]  Yellowstone's getting really intense.
[00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:40.202]  That is all coming up in the second hour.
[00:54:40.202 --> 00:54:49.872]  But at the bottom of the hour, I'm not going to push it, but I want to get all my documents together and all my little duckies in a little quackable happy row.
[00:54:49.872 --> 00:54:55.297]  We're going to exclusively reveal to you that your televisions, whether you turn them on or off,
[00:54:58.083 --> 00:54:59.284]  We're good to go.
[00:55:24.206 --> 00:55:25.887]  I tried back when nobody knew what was going on.
[00:55:25.887 --> 00:55:27.448]  Boy, could have really turned it around then.
[00:55:27.448 --> 00:55:29.089]  Now they're rolling it out.
[00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:30.330]  Ubiquitous.
[00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.011]  100% rollout.
[00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:37.375]  So, we can get a wave on this and hopefully have some debate about this and stop the screen sickness and so much more.
[00:55:38.607 --> 00:55:40.408]  So, we're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:55:40.408 --> 00:55:42.488]  Screen sickness is another term I coined.
[00:55:42.488 --> 00:55:43.428]  That's what it is.
[00:55:43.428 --> 00:55:44.709]  Lowers your IQ, lowers everything.
[00:55:44.709 --> 00:55:51.611]  We're going to discuss it all, especially stuff that they're not to challenge you, not to bring in complex thought processes.
[00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:53.951]  You could turn the video off and listen to the show.
[00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:56.072]  It'll get you thinking, just like reading a book will.
[00:55:56.072 --> 00:56:01.393]  But the flicker rates, everything, still lowers your consciousness, lowers your brainwave.
[00:56:01.393 --> 00:56:04.934]  Once you're in that highly suggestible state, this is on record, they can fully program you.
[00:56:04.934 --> 00:56:07.695]  So just at your own peril, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:08.948 --> 00:56:11.150]  All right.
[00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.412]  Huge special.
[00:56:12.412 --> 00:56:17.737]  We haven't had this in about, I don't know, a month or so, but it's so popular, we're bringing it back.
[00:56:17.737 --> 00:56:18.678]  All Super Blue.
[00:56:18.678 --> 00:56:24.744]  That's the colloidal silver and iodine fortified Made in America organic toothpaste.
[00:56:24.744 --> 00:56:26.866]  All Super Blue products at the InfoWare store.
[00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:30.490]  50% off for a very limited time.
[00:56:31.491 --> 00:56:33.633]  And you can find out all about it for adults.
[00:56:33.633 --> 00:56:34.974]  We have a children's as well.
[00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:36.735]  It's the best toothpaste out there.
[00:56:36.735 --> 00:56:38.777]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:56:38.777 --> 00:56:39.678]  Find out about it.
[00:56:39.678 --> 00:56:40.639]  Your children deserve it.
[00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:43.541]  And we think it's the best toothpaste ever.
[00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:45.362]  Here's some of the reviews.
[00:56:45.362 --> 00:56:50.787]  This is Best Toothpaste by Sandra, an undisclosed location, verified buyer.
[00:56:50.787 --> 00:56:53.109]  This has got to be the very best toothpaste that I have ever found.
[00:56:54.181 --> 00:56:56.183]  If you've not tried it, you need to get this toothpaste.
[00:56:56.183 --> 00:56:58.165]  My gums have never felt so good.
[00:56:58.165 --> 00:57:00.187]  My teeth are squeaky clean.
[00:57:00.187 --> 00:57:04.311]  When using Super Blue toothpaste, I am fixing to order some more.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.981]  BioPQQ, more CoQ10 than DNA Force.
[00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:20.541]  We call it DNA Force Plus at a reduced price.
[00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:28.203]  We got a big deal on this, so it's a couple hundred dollars less than leading competitors sold at medical clinics, as if the prescription they're not.
[00:57:28.203 --> 00:57:29.263]  $69.95, you cannot get a better deal.
[00:57:29.263 --> 00:57:31.403]  This is galactic good.
[00:57:31.403 --> 00:57:35.664]  Also Icarin for liver and kidney detox, 50% off out of the gates, only $19.95.
[00:57:35.664 --> 00:57:40.065]  Infowarstore.com, you cannot fund a more hardcore pro-human
[00:57:40.565 --> 00:57:41.706]  We're good to go.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.746]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:57:54.746 --> 00:57:59.531]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:08.220]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.464]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:58:11.704 --> 00:58:16.948]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:58:16.948 --> 00:58:24.254]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:28.178]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:58:28.178 --> 00:58:32.902]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:58:32.902 --> 00:58:36.965]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a
[00:58:37.425 --> 00:58:40.967]  50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:58:40.967 --> 00:58:45.169]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:58:45.169 --> 00:58:53.393]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:53.393 --> 00:58:58.075]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:58:58.075 --> 00:58:59.576]  Optimum levels.
[00:59:00.646 --> 00:59:05.288]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:59:05.288 --> 00:59:07.609]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:09.389]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:59:09.389 --> 00:59:14.671]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:59:14.671 --> 00:59:16.292]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:59:17.012 --> 00:59:22.638]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory and lethargy.
[00:59:22.638 --> 00:59:24.479]  Secret 12.
[00:59:24.479 --> 00:59:25.641]  Optimal absorption.
[00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:30.786]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:59:30.786 --> 00:59:35.971]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:59:35.971 --> 00:59:36.711]  Optimum levels.
[00:59:38.132 --> 00:59:42.275]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[00:59:42.275 --> 00:59:47.438]  Head to Infowarslife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:52.880]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:59.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.404 --> 01:00:04.487]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:21.114]  So, we've got new flashbacks that intrepid investigators have ferreted out from television archives that are being dumped online more and more.
[01:00:21.114 --> 01:00:26.196]  Very, very useful for the folks that are willing to pound through all the old C-SPAN video.
[01:00:26.196 --> 01:00:28.537]  Everything C-SPAN's ever aired has been put up.
[01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:32.319]  Everything ABC, CBS, NBC, they're all just posting it.
[01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:40.943]  And you go in there and it is just a treasure trove of, back when they knew America was somewhat awake,
[01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:45.597]  At least the globalism and open borders.
[01:00:45.597 --> 01:00:51.325]  How they camel-nosed under the tent flap and would sit there and say the exact same things that Donald Trump is saying today.
[01:00:51.325 --> 01:00:53.609]  He's just actually doing something about it.
[01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:56.293]  So we've got a Feinstein new flashback that's coming up.
[01:00:57.338 --> 01:00:58.599]  And so much more.
[01:00:58.599 --> 01:01:02.243]  And then, of course, the big news, the ultimate big brother news, bottom of the hour.
[01:01:02.243 --> 01:01:03.984]  But right now, I'm gonna go to this video.
[01:01:03.984 --> 01:01:08.168]  We must reclaim our republic because that's what it's all about.
[01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:11.912]  We must reclaim our republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:11.912 --> 01:01:15.275]  And I was thinking about that line in that song.
[01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.596]  Proud to be an American?
[01:01:26.596 --> 01:01:32.600]  And the flag still stands for freedom?
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.221]  And they can't take that away.
[01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:41.386]  And I remember growing up hearing that and thinking, I love America, but that's a little cheesy.
[01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:47.290]  But as you get older, you learn that's how criminals operate.
[01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:52.334]  Is that once they get control, they want to take everything away from you.
[01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:53.414]  And modern liberals
[01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.676]  Are just criminals.
[01:01:56.676 --> 01:02:00.357]  And studies show that.
[01:02:00.357 --> 01:02:09.179]  Depending on the studies, six to nine times more likely British, US studies, Canadian studies, by liberal universities.
[01:02:09.179 --> 01:02:13.260]  By the psychology departments.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.201]  That they're way meaner.
[01:02:16.201 --> 01:02:17.982]  Give way less charity.
[01:02:17.982 --> 01:02:18.562]  And steal.
[01:02:21.058 --> 01:02:22.302]  And it's because they're weak!
[01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:36.345]  Where the money was taken from the investors from Freddie and Fannie, the two large mortgage giants.
[01:02:36.345 --> 01:02:41.730]  The Treasury put it into their general fund, and then we watched the accounting.
[01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:48.735]  We did an Excel chart, which shows exactly how the money was diverted into health and Medicare.
[01:02:48.735 --> 01:02:57.783]  And the dollar flows are dramatically a pattern that confirms when the money was taken out of Fannie and Freddie, Treasury shuffled it off and did this.
[01:02:58.283 --> 01:03:03.527]  Commerce and housing and then it ends up in their line items for expenditures and health and Medicare.
[01:03:03.527 --> 01:03:05.389]  And I've looked at the federal law and you've covered it.
[01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:06.890]  It's totally illegal.
[01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:08.111]  Totally illegal.
[01:03:08.111 --> 01:03:11.434]  And this also proves why it's so important right now.
[01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:14.557]  It's time for all these gangster thugs of the Democratic Party that want to fight.
[01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:15.617]  It's time they start getting one.
[01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:18.079]  Of course, they'll just blow up a school and say we did it.
[01:03:18.079 --> 01:03:22.023]  No, I mean it's time politically for them to get their asses indicted for this and everything else.
[01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:37.269]  This shows, Alex, that Obamacare was bankrupt, and if the Obama administration had not illegally taken money that was never appropriated for this purpose, looted it, and robbed the investors.
[01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:38.450]  I mean, there's lawsuits on this.
[01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:43.013]  The investors were... This is the biggest theft of corporate dividends in U.S.
[01:03:43.013 --> 01:03:44.333]  financial history.
[01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:51.618]  And the system seeks to arrest the development of individuals so they can control them throughout their lives.
[01:03:53.168 --> 01:04:11.214]  I thought it critical, absolutely critical to talk about the psychology of these people.
[01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:17.216]  And just that line, the flag still stands for freedom, and they can't
[01:04:18.345 --> 01:04:21.026]  Take that away.
[01:04:21.026 --> 01:04:42.275]  So part of taking America back is having a wall, is having visas, is having sovereignty, and is supporting the men and women who served in our military and who serve in it now, not because you're in a cult of worshipping the military, but because you understand the globalist
[01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:49.840]  We want to take that away from you and demoralize the nation so we can be controlled.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.487]  And everything Trump's doing is to stop the demoralization.
[01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:07.180]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.743]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:05:11.743 --> 01:05:14.865]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:05:14.865 --> 01:05:17.987]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:05:19.488 --> 01:05:32.334]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:47.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:05:48.381 --> 01:05:52.643]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it can do for your family.
[01:05:52.643 --> 01:05:54.384]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.825]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:05:56.825 --> 01:06:15.112]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.694 --> 01:06:26.941]  You know, Tucker Carlson is the slickest, in a good way, smartest person on television right now.
[01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:32.325]  Sean Hannity is the most dogged and has the most courage.
[01:06:32.325 --> 01:06:39.751]  But Lou Dobbs, in his massive knowledge of politics, of business, of everything, really is the master.
[01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:40.652]  And that's all on Fox.
[01:06:42.003 --> 01:06:45.066]  Fox tried to be anti-Trump until about six months ago.
[01:06:45.066 --> 01:06:47.327]  They lost about half their viewers and almost killed him.
[01:06:47.327 --> 01:06:52.312]  And then that attempt failed and now the floodgates are open again to tell the truth.
[01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.193]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[01:06:54.193 --> 01:06:57.156]  But think about where we'd be if it wasn't for Fox News.
[01:06:57.156 --> 01:07:04.682]  And the only reason I say that is, the globalists are constantly in their public white papers scheming how to bring down Fox.
[01:07:04.682 --> 01:07:08.985]  And how to pressure Murdoch to do it.
[01:07:08.985 --> 01:07:10.487]  But Murdoch has hedged his bets.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.565]  And he's now burrowed in with Trump, talking to him every day, I'm told.
[01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:20.689]  And really knows how to be a sycophant, trying to lick his rear end.
[01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:25.213]  I'm sorry to use a gross term like that, but I want this to get to the President, so I just said it.
[01:07:25.213 --> 01:07:30.899]  Murdoch is trying to not just brown nose, but kiss the rose of Venus' shame.
[01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:48.668]  He's up there pitching, sir, just, it's like utilities, but you need to be able to have people that are able to create monopolies, and we need to be able to just come in and shut down all the alternative media, and then it'll be Fox News everywhere, sir, and that's what he's openly promoting to Facebook and Twitter.
[01:07:48.668 --> 01:07:55.434]  I mean, I heard about this six months ago from sources, that Murdoch's in there constantly, meeting with him all the time, on the phone with him every day.
[01:07:56.155 --> 01:08:07.762]  And that Murdoch's got a plan to have Trump block the monopolies of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, which they're trying to set up, which Obama set up with his so-called net neutrality move, which wasn't net neutrality.
[01:08:07.762 --> 01:08:10.263]  We had somewhat of net neutrality before.
[01:08:10.263 --> 01:08:13.865]  The FCC had done its job getting out of the way.
[01:08:13.865 --> 01:08:16.707]  And I've interviewed former heads of the FCC, former general counsels.
[01:08:16.707 --> 01:08:18.568]  I mean, we've got the experts here.
[01:08:18.568 --> 01:08:20.989]  I don't just, you know, look at mainstream media.
[01:08:20.989 --> 01:08:21.750]  I do my own research.
[01:08:23.024 --> 01:08:28.666]  So what Obama did a year and a half ago was really bad, turning the internet over to Soros and the UN and the globalists.
[01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:31.507]  Trump comes in, he's kind of blocked that, but not even fully.
[01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:33.567]  It's regulatory, it's hard to do once it was in play.
[01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:42.450]  I mean, Obama federalized the next elections coming up, put it under Homeland Security rule, and all 50 Attorney Generals, including Democrats, wrote letters saying, please reverse it.
[01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:43.531]  And Trump hadn't done that.
[01:08:43.531 --> 01:08:44.151]  Maybe Trump...
[01:08:45.131 --> 01:08:46.832]  He wants to have Homeland Security in control.
[01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.552]  I think that's unconstitutional.
[01:08:48.552 --> 01:08:49.432]  I think it's dangerous.
[01:08:49.432 --> 01:08:51.613]  And he doesn't control that bureaucracy.
[01:08:51.613 --> 01:08:55.494]  If he thinks he'll have them guard it, it's full of globalists.
[01:08:55.494 --> 01:08:56.635]  They're going to steal the election.
[01:08:56.635 --> 01:08:58.335]  Look at what happened with Roy Moore.
[01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.016]  So, sorry, this gets into complexities.
[01:09:01.016 --> 01:09:02.837]  See, this isn't like your regular radio show.
[01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:04.257]  You're just inside my head right now.
[01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:11.719]  I was about to cover all these big subjects and I was just thinking how thankful I was to Tucker Carlson that he's so smart.
[01:09:11.719 --> 01:09:14.640]  It's good to have other brains out there like that.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.821]  I'm exhausted a lot of the time.
[01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:23.743]  And I'm very thankful to know there's Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and out there.
[01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.164]  Thank God.
[01:09:25.164 --> 01:09:26.004]  They're not perfect.
[01:09:26.004 --> 01:09:26.944]  I'm not perfect either.
[01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.305]  But they're not out to get you.
[01:09:28.305 --> 01:09:31.446]  And then we wouldn't be here without Matt Drudge.
[01:09:31.446 --> 01:09:33.367]  Fox would have buckled.
[01:09:33.367 --> 01:09:35.308]  And all this would have buckled if Drudge wasn't there.
[01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:36.088]  Drudge is the
[01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:48.742]  The cornerstone, the linchpin, the secret sauce, the... But you know, if you look at God's plan, if I wasn't here, we wouldn't be here.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:50.764]  If you weren't here, we wouldn't be here.
[01:09:50.764 --> 01:09:59.771]  Our active audience, if Drudge wasn't there, if Trump hadn't been there to seize the moment with the catalyst, the final headstone,
[01:10:01.345 --> 01:10:05.047]  Capstone, not to use an Illuminati term, they just grab every term and make it theirs.
[01:10:05.047 --> 01:10:07.708]  I mean, Trump is the capstone of the relaunch of the Republic.
[01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:09.629]  He's the nose cone on the rocket.
[01:10:09.629 --> 01:10:11.811]  Infowars is the fuel.
[01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:15.052]  And all of us are just as important as the other some parts.
[01:10:15.052 --> 01:10:16.893]  There isn't some elitism here.
[01:10:16.893 --> 01:10:18.174]  There isn't some competition.
[01:10:18.174 --> 01:10:24.938]  This is a death battle with anti-human, satanic, monopolistic scumbag forces.
[01:10:25.967 --> 01:10:29.828]  Who are spewing race and culture division and just evil.
[01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:38.310]  We have to declare our race, our religion, whoever you are, whatever you stand for, because the globalists want to outlaw it all and override it.
[01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:41.030]  Doesn't mean our cultures are perfect.
[01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.971]  But man, they're real and they came from somewhere real.
[01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:50.653]  We better hold on to them like we've been thrown off a ship in a storm and we found a barrel or we found some driftwood.
[01:10:50.653 --> 01:10:51.693]  We better hold on to that.
[01:10:52.938 --> 01:10:57.941]  We can't swim for three, four days before we hit land.
[01:10:57.941 --> 01:10:59.642]  That's why they say you can't have mother and father.
[01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:03.544]  You can't have, you know, terms like family.
[01:11:03.544 --> 01:11:04.505]  You can't have church.
[01:11:04.505 --> 01:11:07.667]  Because they try to take all that over.
[01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:10.769]  But now in their final phase, they want to get rid of it even existing.
[01:11:10.769 --> 01:11:15.091]  So all you've got's that television and all you've got's that smartphone.
[01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:16.472]  And that's why they want to get me off here.
[01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.794]  Because I know this is an evil medium.
[01:11:18.794 --> 01:11:20.675]  But I'm jacking into the Matrix every day.
[01:11:21.783 --> 01:11:31.386]  If you're watching, I'm in here bathed in these lights and jacketed in all this electronics and uplinks and all the rest of it because it's a war and it doesn't matter what happens to me.
[01:11:31.386 --> 01:11:35.227]  What matters is the continuum of the species.
[01:11:35.227 --> 01:11:40.429]  Now that is an anti-collectivist statement.
[01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:43.750]  I am anti-collectivist because I am a total collectivist.
[01:11:45.231 --> 01:11:51.253]  I am anti-collectivist because I am a 1000% total collectivist.
[01:11:51.253 --> 01:12:01.878]  It is the sum individual parts that are the strength, the vigor, the wisdom, the force, and the will of the group to act in the good of the group.
[01:12:01.878 --> 01:12:04.879]  That doesn't mean suborning my individual fire.
[01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:12.635]  My Promethean fire to the globalists who have fallen so that they can play God.
[01:12:12.635 --> 01:12:17.900]  I will give my individual will and strength and full measure for the collective.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.261]  1000%.
[01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:21.064]  And that is the secret.
[01:12:21.064 --> 01:12:22.606]  I am a total collectivist!
[01:12:23.831 --> 01:12:29.793]  And that means I believe in the individual and I believe in all of your success and all of your will and all of your strength.
[01:12:29.793 --> 01:12:33.114]  Because the strength of the whole is the strength of the individual.
[01:12:33.114 --> 01:12:35.694]  It is not the strength of the individual, it is the strength of the whole.
[01:12:35.694 --> 01:12:37.735]  That's ass backwards!
[01:12:37.735 --> 01:12:42.016]  We go from subatomic particles and build upward to the structure of the universe.
[01:12:42.016 --> 01:12:47.497]  The great structure of the universe is not that which then goes down into the foundations of it.
[01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:51.939]  It comes up from the foundations into it.
[01:12:51.939 --> 01:12:53.019]  And these are the great secrets.
[01:12:54.997 --> 01:13:00.999]  The spark of creativity, the spark of genesis comes from the man and the woman.
[01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:10.742]  And you attack those, the progenitor of our species in its space leap.
[01:13:10.742 --> 01:13:15.464]  Your great great great great great great great great grandmother is alive in you right now.
[01:13:15.464 --> 01:13:24.487]  She has time jumped by her will, her genes, her genetics, her everything to survive through all this in you today.
[01:13:27.765 --> 01:13:28.666]  And what does she want?
[01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.567]  She wants you to be successful.
[01:13:30.567 --> 01:13:32.248]  She wants you to move forward.
[01:13:32.248 --> 01:13:35.491]  And she loves your great-great-grandchildren who aren't even born.
[01:13:35.491 --> 01:13:40.915]  And she'll give everything she's got just to make sure you don't die.
[01:13:40.915 --> 01:13:45.238]  And by that, you have to die so that it doesn't die.
[01:13:45.238 --> 01:13:45.998]  You will die.
[01:13:45.998 --> 01:13:50.201]  The only death is giving up on that continuum.
[01:13:50.201 --> 01:13:53.023]  That's the death I fear.
[01:13:53.023 --> 01:13:56.546]  The Satanist is a cancer that is cut off from the collective.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:04.805]  So it always seeks to build a artificiality of what it believes we are.
[01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:18.433]  It wants to build the counterfeit so it builds a collective directed by globalist kingpins and inbred globalists who are totally obsessed with control as if that is what built all this.
[01:14:18.433 --> 01:14:20.435]  That builds Venezuela.
[01:14:20.435 --> 01:14:22.396]  That builds North Korea.
[01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:25.158]  That builds Nazi Germany.
[01:14:25.158 --> 01:14:26.619]  That destroys planets.
[01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:32.898]  That destroys star systems!
[01:14:32.898 --> 01:14:34.699]  And you know it has.
[01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:36.781]  In your heart, it's all written there.
[01:14:36.781 --> 01:14:39.323]  The long course of human events.
[01:14:39.323 --> 01:14:46.028]  The long course of our different struggles and our different embryonic phases and our different adventures together.
[01:14:46.028 --> 01:14:51.432]  That's such a long road that we can't even imagine.
[01:14:53.274 --> 01:15:05.239]  This Genesis is a new Genesis, but the Genesis of many, and the enemy knows it, and the enemy's pissed at all times, because even if they blow this planet up, they didn't stop anything.
[01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:16.624]  Seeds are blown in the wind, some fall on rocks, some fall on the dirt, some are eaten by the birds, but some grow up into huge trees and create galaxies of more life.
[01:15:16.624 --> 01:15:19.165]  And as long as you bow down to God,
[01:15:20.373 --> 01:15:25.116]  From which all of this flows, you're in good hands.
[01:15:25.116 --> 01:15:27.377]  And you cannot lose.
[01:15:27.377 --> 01:15:34.281]  And so all of these artificial constructs and everything that's been put in place is to separate you from God.
[01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:38.563]  Because God is all there is, all there ever was, and all there ever will be.
[01:15:39.772 --> 01:15:44.117]  And that is the war on for your soul, the war on for your mind.
[01:15:44.117 --> 01:15:51.665]  We're going to go back in the time machine on the Democrats with some new flashbacks where they've got egg on their face dealing with globalism and open borders.
[01:15:51.665 --> 01:15:55.789]  And then the next phase of Big Brother revealed here exclusively.
[01:15:57.643 --> 01:16:01.386]  One out of four people listening to my voice right now could die from heart disease.
[01:16:01.386 --> 01:16:06.089]  This could be your last year and you don't even know it because you don't know the early warning signs.
[01:16:06.089 --> 01:16:09.191]  If you think you're safe because your cholesterol levels are normal, think again.
[01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:14.014]  Because studies show that 75% of heart attack patients also had normal cholesterol levels.
[01:16:14.014 --> 01:16:19.498]  Let me introduce you to Strauss Heart Drops, a world-famous heart and brain formula made in Canada.

[01:19:10.299 --> 01:19:18.825]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:27.591]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:39.892]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:19:39.892 --> 01:19:49.274]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:19:49.274 --> 01:19:51.955]  It is amazing!
[01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:56.916]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:20:02.105 --> 01:20:14.493]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.493 --> 01:20:18.296]  The telescreens were always on, even when your television was off.
[01:20:18.296 --> 01:20:19.517]  Austin, Texas.
[01:20:19.517 --> 01:20:21.998]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:21.998 --> 01:20:25.621]  It's Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:26.897 --> 01:20:31.861]  Coming up, next segment, if Kit Daniels is ready with the article, he's awesome.
[01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:33.742]  I said, we'll go with the story tomorrow.
[01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:34.643]  I want to codify it.
[01:20:34.643 --> 01:20:35.504]  We already have all the facts.
[01:20:35.504 --> 01:20:36.685]  This is so big.
[01:20:36.685 --> 01:20:40.788]  He said, I can get it done in a couple hours with the patents, with the documents.
[01:20:40.788 --> 01:20:45.291]  And so he's in there rushing to get it up, and then we'll kind of typo it and stuff once it's out.
[01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:49.334]  But this is certainly drudge worthy, since we're talking about drudge.
[01:20:49.334 --> 01:20:52.917]  It is, in my humble opinion, so important.
[01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:56.145]  What you're about to see coming up.
[01:20:56.145 --> 01:21:00.469]  I may have to push it to the last segment of this hour, but I promise, this hour, we're going to cover it.
[01:21:00.469 --> 01:21:02.431]  Because I don't want to rush Kit.
[01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:04.412]  We've got the video, we're going to air all of it.
[01:21:04.412 --> 01:21:07.375]  You know me, folks, I'll say, coming up, that I cover it right then.
[01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:09.277]  I'm not one of those guys that plants hooks.
[01:21:09.277 --> 01:21:17.084]  I mean, I'll say we're going to break, this is coming up next, because that's what's coming up next, but I'm not like, the suspense, dun-dun-dun-dun, and then the suspense is the meal.
[01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:22.657]  BuzzFeed wrote some article where they claimed, Oh Jones, you know, the suspense is the meal.
[01:21:22.657 --> 01:21:24.218]  There's never really any substance.
[01:21:24.218 --> 01:21:25.838]  It's all just the suspense of it.
[01:21:25.838 --> 01:21:27.099]  Oh, there's no substances.
[01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:34.602]  You know, just all your TVs now are watching you in live time and have built in secret cameras behind the screen or use the entire screen to watch you with.
[01:21:35.422 --> 01:21:41.144]  Information over power line through your house, remote turning your TV on, and watching you even if it wants to.
[01:21:41.144 --> 01:21:43.505]  That's all in the patents and now it's been announced.
[01:21:43.505 --> 01:21:44.706]  Just wait.
[01:21:44.706 --> 01:21:46.506]  There's no meat and potatoes there.
[01:21:46.506 --> 01:21:50.508]  Tomorrow's news today, like Trump's gonna win the election.
[01:21:50.508 --> 01:21:53.329]  Or they gave the questions to Hillary Clinton weeks before.
[01:21:53.329 --> 01:21:54.250]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:54.990]  We broke it first.
[01:21:57.617 --> 01:21:59.999]  I know rehearsed answers when I see it.
[01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:06.863]  And I know about CNN's relationship with the Clinton campaign, and I know she was running the New York Times, the Washington Post, all of it.
[01:22:06.863 --> 01:22:15.990]  She had herself and her staff, you gotta hand her the amount of work she was doing, on the phone basically all the time, like hours a day, with all these newspapers, telling them what to do!
[01:22:17.486 --> 01:22:30.534]  We have internal documents and video from Veritas where the New York Times has a, what was it, one of the vice presidents of YouTube's communicating with them about how to censor me in live time.
[01:22:30.534 --> 01:22:34.817]  They have congressional hearings where they go, InfoWars was top story, I saw it at lunch.
[01:22:34.817 --> 01:22:37.619]  Sir, we saw it, we took it down.
[01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.340]  Good, do it quicker next time.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.601]  We've got the AI, sir, but it's got problems.
[01:22:41.601 --> 01:22:42.362]  We're almost ready.
[01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:44.593]  How long is that on?
[01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:46.914]  We need to talk in private session, sir.
[01:22:46.914 --> 01:22:55.236]  We're almost ready to launch it now.
[01:22:55.236 --> 01:23:04.038]  This is beyond Communist China, and then it's in the news that Communist China is where they tested it, and they're bringing it here!
[01:23:04.038 --> 01:23:11.080]  And the Pope is saying Communist China is the ultimate humanitarian organization and the example of human dignity!
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.546]  If human dignity means getting 80 plus million people killed, damn right!
[01:23:18.546 --> 01:23:21.150]  80 million plus people.
[01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:23.352]  Millions shot, millions their organs sold.
[01:23:24.485 --> 01:23:29.207]  Not counting the millions of babies force-aborted little girls, but, oh, the feminists don't have a word to say about that.
[01:23:29.207 --> 01:23:32.068]  Oh, aborting most of the girls, that's very liberal.
[01:23:32.068 --> 01:23:33.789]  It's all sick!
[01:23:33.789 --> 01:23:39.791]  They tell you they're feminists, Harvey Weinstein, because he's reportedly raping women every couple of days.
[01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:40.552]  That's what he likes.
[01:23:40.552 --> 01:23:48.355]  90-pound little women that look like they're 12, who are 18, some of them 16, and he just rapes them reportedly.
[01:23:49.738 --> 01:23:54.279]  And the feminists are defending him because raping little girls is liberal!
[01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:58.120]  Look at Roman Polanski, look at the Hollywood protecting him.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:03.101]  What they tell you, they're fighting, they're doing.
[01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:05.002]  Comprende?
[01:24:05.002 --> 01:24:06.022]  Comprehend it?
[01:24:06.022 --> 01:24:17.345]  I know you know, but understand when I say the globalist technocracy is typecasting, is psychologically coming up with a certain type of person they want to run things.
[01:24:20.029 --> 01:24:22.454]  It is the pedophile.
[01:24:22.454 --> 01:24:28.886]  Because somebody that wants to abuse children will abuse humanity, they will abuse life, they will abuse anything.
[01:24:28.886 --> 01:24:30.890]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip here as I mentioned it.
[01:24:32.005 --> 01:24:33.466]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:24:33.466 --> 01:24:35.388]  This is a flashback of so many.
[01:24:35.388 --> 01:24:38.490]  This is a new one on Infowars.com today.
[01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:46.436]  And this is Feinstein flashback, day when Americans could be the welfare state for Mexico is gone.
[01:24:46.436 --> 01:24:47.116]  Here it is.
[01:24:47.116 --> 01:24:49.358]  This is from many, many years ago, 1993.
[01:24:49.358 --> 01:24:49.698]  Here it is.
[01:24:51.024 --> 01:24:55.347]  Come to these two borders, you have to remember a couple of things.
[01:24:55.347 --> 01:25:10.918]  In Mexico, there is no welfare, there is no AFDC, there is no SSI, there is no Medicaid, there is no Social Security, there is no Medicare, and there's a 58 cent an hour minimum wage.
[01:25:10.918 --> 01:25:14.241]  Mexico does nothing to enforce its border.
[01:25:15.141 --> 01:25:24.465]  It is my view that if we are going to have a North American Free Trade Agreement, that Mexico must do its share.
[01:25:24.465 --> 01:25:31.448]  Because the day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone.
[01:25:31.448 --> 01:25:33.109]  We simply can't afford it.
[01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:38.615]  And I think you've seen the figures to state and local governments of what the cost is.
[01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:42.239]  It's over $2 billion in California alone.
[01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:48.085]  And I have those figures, if you want them in specific, in my purse.
[01:25:48.085 --> 01:25:53.792]  And that's why the issue is now joined with 2 million illegal immigrants.
[01:25:54.944 --> 01:25:57.186]  It's a competition for space.
[01:25:57.186 --> 01:26:06.354]  Whether the space is a job, the space is a home, a place in a classroom, it becomes a competition for space.
[01:26:06.354 --> 01:26:09.296]  This is a country that's based on immigration.
[01:26:09.296 --> 01:26:10.757]  And we all know that.
[01:26:10.757 --> 01:26:19.885]  And yet, at times, you become so overtaxed, you have to concentrate on saying, the people who should be here are those who come legally at this time.
[01:26:19.885 --> 01:26:23.548]  And we've got to, for the time being, enforce our borders.
[01:26:25.265 --> 01:26:29.128]  But see, under globalism, I can play you Obama, I can play you Bill Clinton, I can play you Hillary.
[01:26:29.128 --> 01:26:30.449]  We've all heard the clips.
[01:26:30.449 --> 01:26:33.552]  But that's a new one that's come up from C-SPAN.
[01:26:33.552 --> 01:26:34.773]  And here's the deal.
[01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:48.824]  You can't have a high standard of living here, and a high tax rate, and then bring in a bunch of people, or you get a wall-wall-west collapse, and people are back living in slave camps and crapping all over themselves.
[01:26:48.824 --> 01:26:54.028]  And you don't raise up the Third World Studies Show by lowering to its level, or merging with it.
[01:26:54.028 --> 01:26:54.669]  You become it.
[01:26:55.595 --> 01:26:57.996]  That's just a fact.
[01:26:57.996 --> 01:27:09.378]  And when you politically take in these people and program them to be anti-white, anti-American, so that globalists can take over, it's over.
[01:27:09.378 --> 01:27:10.499]  The society will fall.
[01:27:10.499 --> 01:27:15.860]  And this, according to the EU's own chief, is their geopolitical plan.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:22.302]  Article, it's on newswars.com by Dan Lyman, EU chief, we'd open borders to stop populism.
[01:27:22.302 --> 01:27:23.582]  Oh, you don't like the unelected EU?
[01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:37.396]  Well, let's bring in 10 million people, 80% of military-age men, let them do whatever the hell they want, give them free housing, throw old people out of their government housing, because you've got to have an incentive to bring them here.
[01:27:37.396 --> 01:27:48.839]  Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, delivered remarks in Vienna in which he warned against the destructive motions of those who oppose the ongoing migrant invasion and denounce the rise of populism in Europe.
[01:27:48.839 --> 01:27:53.340]  And these are irregular troops coming in to be the muscle of the left.
[01:27:54.824 --> 01:28:05.706]  Now before we go to break and come back with this huge breaking news, we are doing 50% off our super high quality colloidal silver fortified and iodine fortified

[01:28:16.405 --> 01:28:18.146]  It costs us a lot to make it.

[01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:42.415]  That's about to end.

[01:32:37.768 --> 01:32:39.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.226 --> 01:33:17.287]  Resistance to pirates is obedience to God.
[01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:22.429]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.429 --> 01:33:25.329]  Okay, the next segment's about a minute longer.
[01:33:25.329 --> 01:33:29.371]  The segments are all about 10 minutes, but the next segment's 10 minutes, 50 seconds long.
[01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:33.572]  And so I'm gonna break the big news at the start of the next segment, and it is big news.
[01:33:34.486 --> 01:33:42.913]  A lot of people drum up how big their news is going to be, and it's not really that big a news, and then people just get used to hearing, this is big news, this is big news.
[01:33:42.913 --> 01:33:44.654]  This isn't just big news.
[01:33:44.654 --> 01:33:50.138]  It's about you being concerned about it, and it's about you making it big news.
[01:33:50.138 --> 01:33:59.326]  Because so much of the psychological warfare out there is about just getting you to acquiesce, getting you to break your back politically, getting you to give in, give up, demoralize you.
[01:33:59.326 --> 01:34:00.347]  But I'll give you the headline.
[01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:09.832]  It just went live on InfoWars.com and it's a smattering of the info we're gonna cover in the next segment and the backstory and how big it is.
[01:34:09.832 --> 01:34:11.753]  But the story just went live.
[01:34:11.753 --> 01:34:14.733]  Hit refresh on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:21.354]  We're uploading it to our other sites right now like NewsWars.com.
[01:34:21.354 --> 01:34:26.855]  Exclusive ESPN admits to watching you through your TV.
[01:34:26.855 --> 01:34:29.916]  Ultimate Big Brother technology rolled out on unsuspecting fans.
[01:34:31.616 --> 01:34:33.797]  We have the video.
[01:34:33.797 --> 01:34:34.697]  This is nowhere.
[01:34:34.697 --> 01:34:37.418]  A listener sent us this.
[01:34:37.418 --> 01:34:39.998]  We found another source, confirmed it.
[01:34:39.998 --> 01:34:45.300]  This is unbelievable.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.941]  So, and this is them watching them in another country.
[01:34:49.941 --> 01:34:51.542]  And they don't even describe what's happening.
[01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:52.462]  It's meant to be a mystery.
[01:34:52.462 --> 01:34:54.282]  We looked it up.
[01:34:54.282 --> 01:34:56.203]  So you wonder how they're gonna roll this out on you?
[01:34:57.042 --> 01:34:57.863]  Just boom!
[01:34:57.863 --> 01:34:58.884]  Oh yeah!
[01:34:58.884 --> 01:35:00.806]  In a nice, fun atmosphere.
[01:35:00.806 --> 01:35:02.668]  Not having a debate about is it good, is it bad.
[01:35:02.668 --> 01:35:03.909]  Just suddenly, it's here!
[01:35:03.909 --> 01:35:10.716]  It's like you're Austria in 1939 and suddenly the Nazis just march in.
[01:35:10.716 --> 01:35:12.818]  You don't announce it.
[01:35:12.818 --> 01:35:13.960]  You just are there.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.101]  Oh hey, we're watching your house!
[01:35:16.954 --> 01:35:18.497]  And you're like, oh, everybody knows they're doing that.
[01:35:18.497 --> 01:35:18.958]  Oh, really?
[01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:22.525]  I was the crazy kid for warning you exactly how they do it 20 years ago.
[01:35:22.525 --> 01:35:27.916]  My point is, they want to just to get you ready like a frog in a boiling pot where it's kind of bubbling and you kind of just pass out and die.
[01:35:29.093 --> 01:35:30.734]  Come on, froggies, get out of the pot.
[01:35:30.734 --> 01:35:34.377]  Froggie, froggie, I used to be one of your little froggie in the pot.
[01:35:34.377 --> 01:35:34.737]  Come on.
[01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:35.257]  No, no, no.
[01:35:35.257 --> 01:35:36.958]  You don't want to roll your eyes back.
[01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:37.879]  I can't pick you up.
[01:35:37.879 --> 01:35:38.779]  You have to get on your own.
[01:35:38.779 --> 01:35:40.000]  It's called free will.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.301]  Come, froggie.
[01:35:41.301 --> 01:35:42.802]  You little froggie.
[01:35:42.802 --> 01:35:43.443]  Nice, happy.
[01:35:43.443 --> 01:35:45.244]  Hop off and enjoy yourself.
[01:35:45.244 --> 01:35:46.865]  But you've got to get out of the pot.
[01:35:50.896 --> 01:35:53.237]  You got the globalist Cajun there with the seasoning.
[01:35:53.237 --> 01:35:54.977]  I'm not Cajuns, but they eat frogs.
[01:35:54.977 --> 01:35:56.958]  You know what I mean?
[01:35:56.958 --> 01:35:58.558]  This is serious business, folks.
[01:35:58.558 --> 01:36:03.360]  I don't have to explain to you how it's bad the TVs are watching and listening to you, right?
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.080]  Right, right.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.300]  Remember still that's bad?
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.800]  Remember 1984?
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.161]  Remember?
[01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:11.942]  I'm going to cover that too coming up.
[01:36:11.942 --> 01:36:13.202]  But I haven't done proper plugging.
[01:36:13.202 --> 01:36:18.184]  I did like a one-minute plug last hour, one-minute plug just now because we need to fund our operation.
[01:36:18.184 --> 01:36:18.644]  We are
[01:36:19.918 --> 01:36:23.522]  Launching three different satellite uplinks.
[01:36:23.522 --> 01:36:25.604]  Now, we've got two right now.
[01:36:25.604 --> 01:36:31.550]  We're going to do one more so we can really service all the cable and TV stations in North America.
[01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:33.932]  And then I want to get on one that goes into Europe and everywhere else.
[01:36:33.932 --> 01:36:35.253]  And these aren't just the satellites.
[01:36:35.253 --> 01:36:37.516]  I'll be announcing what it does soon.
[01:36:37.516 --> 01:36:40.999]  They're the big ones, the big giant dishes for the best HD.
[01:36:40.999 --> 01:36:42.621]  Then there's the systems that
[01:36:44.775 --> 01:36:47.718]  Galaxy 16, you name it, that blasts the entire U.S.
[01:36:47.718 --> 01:36:52.162]  where a small dish can see it, but also all the TV stations, all of them can get it.
[01:36:52.162 --> 01:36:54.884]  We got a bunch wanting the show.
[01:36:54.884 --> 01:36:57.566]  So, we're lining up all sorts of stuff right now.
[01:36:57.566 --> 01:36:59.648]  We got two links up now.
[01:36:59.648 --> 01:37:00.449]  Three will be up soon.
[01:37:02.588 --> 01:37:12.251]  By next month, I'm gonna announce the rollout to stations, the push for listeners to call their local UHF, VHF stations.
[01:37:12.251 --> 01:37:19.814]  And believe me, all you gotta do is with your local UHF and VHF, most of them are on basic cable.
[01:37:19.814 --> 01:37:29.157]  And basic cable is, the little secret is, is more than half the viewers on a regular cable sign-up are watching basic.
[01:37:30.373 --> 01:37:32.595]  The bottom 40 channels or so.
[01:37:32.595 --> 01:37:34.856]  And I looked at the numbers.
[01:37:34.856 --> 01:37:40.000]  People like Glenn Beck spend $25 million or $20 million a year, depending on the year, to have their own glamour channel.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.001]  Oh, look, I have a channel.
[01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:45.324]  Because I was offered... Beck was trying to get out of his channel a few years ago.
[01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:47.005]  The people that were involved in it tried to see if I won.
[01:37:47.005 --> 01:37:52.589]  And I said, I don't have that much money, A, and B, what, be channel 1,800 or something?
[01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:54.490]  And then, OK, people want us, here we are.
[01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.852]  They want to find us in fullwars.com.
[01:37:56.852 --> 01:37:59.074]  There was some huge audience already tuning through there.
[01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:08.468]  Like there is on basic cable systems and UHF and VHF, people that haven't been reached, really, by talk radio or by the internet, that I'm all about it.
[01:38:08.468 --> 01:38:12.612]  People are like, yeah, well, there's kind of an uneducated group on average watching broadcast TV now.
[01:38:12.612 --> 01:38:14.313]  There's all sorts of people watching.
[01:38:14.313 --> 01:38:16.696]  The point is I want to reach people, period.
[01:38:17.639 --> 01:38:28.442]  Folks asked why I went with old Voice of America transmitters that got bought out by private groups when the US stopped transmitting at hundreds of thousands of watts and shortwave into Europe and Africa and everywhere.
[01:38:28.442 --> 01:38:29.963]  They said there's no money in that.
[01:38:29.963 --> 01:38:31.123]  Why are you going to pay $10,000 a month to be on...
[01:38:34.244 --> 01:38:39.326]  Four or five different transmitters, ten hours a day, blasting all over the world.
[01:38:39.326 --> 01:38:44.307]  Because I get letters from missionaries, and letters from African children, and letters from Eastern Europe.
[01:38:44.307 --> 01:38:45.567]  They're listening!
[01:38:45.567 --> 01:38:46.968]  They've got their shortwaves out.
[01:38:46.968 --> 01:38:48.528]  It's a giant audience.
[01:38:48.528 --> 01:38:50.269]  They used to hear the voice of America.
[01:38:50.269 --> 01:38:51.109]  Now that's gone.
[01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:52.689]  They get the real voice of America.
[01:38:52.689 --> 01:38:53.570]  See how that works?
[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:55.850]  I don't care about the money.
[01:38:55.850 --> 01:39:01.432]  The money is to put fuel in this operation to crush globalists.
[01:39:01.432 --> 01:39:01.612]  But,
[01:39:02.932 --> 01:39:08.997]  TV wise, I don't want to even name these stations, because we're not going to list the stations.
[01:39:08.997 --> 01:39:15.222]  People will figure it out local, the listeners will promote the stations, so they don't get harassed, so the globalists don't list their number.
[01:39:15.222 --> 01:39:20.066]  It's not big harassment, but it's enough to get some stations to turn you off.
[01:39:20.066 --> 01:39:22.348]  One of the smartest things I ever did about
[01:39:23.769 --> 01:39:28.312]  Five years ago it was decided to not list our affiliates or only our older, hardcore affiliates.
[01:39:28.312 --> 01:39:31.134]  More than half our affiliates aren't listed on AM radio.
[01:39:31.134 --> 01:39:34.136]  Man, when I did that, it got real good.
[01:39:34.136 --> 01:39:42.962]  Because they know the listeners are going to promote it anyways, it's going to get high ratings, they want to do the right thing, they want to put us on, but they don't want the controversy of being singled out to be targeted.
[01:39:42.962 --> 01:39:44.744]  And it's the same thing.
[01:39:44.744 --> 01:39:47.305]  We have got some of the biggest TV stations in the country
[01:39:48.306 --> 01:39:50.667]  Ready to pick this up.
[01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:52.428]  And some of them are already doing it.
[01:39:52.428 --> 01:39:53.869]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:39:53.869 --> 01:40:01.293]  And we're seeing big financial returns as well to help fund the operation, but not big enough to fund the big expansion I want to do.
[01:40:01.293 --> 01:40:03.634]  I don't want to just sit here and kind of grow a little under attack.
[01:40:03.634 --> 01:40:07.717]  I want to go like, I want to be like the doomsday, but in a good way of talk show.
[01:40:07.717 --> 01:40:12.839]  It's like every time in my life they tried to crush me or suppress me, I explode and get twice as powerful after.
[01:40:12.839 --> 01:40:14.900]  And we're going through a doomsday metamorphosis right now.
[01:40:16.701 --> 01:40:21.903]  And around here all people are getting hired, equipment's going in, satellites, I mean it's happening.
[01:40:21.903 --> 01:40:31.667]  And so I need you to make sure that my next mutation, your next mutation, is very successful and very destructive and destabilizing to the New World Order.
[01:40:32.487 --> 01:40:36.973]  I mean, our full commitment is total war and information with truth against the enemy.
[01:40:36.973 --> 01:40:40.977]  I'm not risking my life and doing this at half measures and playing games and any of this crap.
[01:40:40.977 --> 01:40:43.280]  We're 100% attack the enemy.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.942]  And we're not that perfect or any of that.
[01:40:44.942 --> 01:40:47.025]  We're just, you make us possible.
[01:40:47.025 --> 01:40:48.747]  So I need you to go to infowarestore.com.
[01:40:50.276 --> 01:41:01.926]  And just look at the water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, super high quality, fortified, fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver, and all of it 50% off right now.
[01:41:01.926 --> 01:41:05.449]  And Icarin, the liver and kidney detox, it's so amazing.
[01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:13.396]  Strongest formula out there from our research of the known concentrated herbs and compounds to flush that garbage out and give your body the boost it needs.
[01:41:13.396 --> 01:41:15.638]  And CellForce will be known as DNAForce Plus soon.
[01:41:16.539 --> 01:41:19.240]  For $69.95, that's one of our more expensive products.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:26.263]  Leading competitors are $200 or $300 for formulas not as strong, because the BioPQQ and CoQ10 is expensive, but they mark stuff up seven times.
[01:41:26.263 --> 01:41:30.585]  Oh no, we got $35 worth of product in the bottle, and that's $69.
[01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:33.766]  That's 100% markup.
[01:41:33.766 --> 01:41:41.690]  This is like, you want the real CoQ10 and BioPQQ, this is like nuclear bomb level, and it's not on the bad stuff in your body, and it's not
[01:41:42.799 --> 01:41:43.959]  The synthetic crap.
[01:41:43.959 --> 01:41:45.820]  That's why it's more expensive for us.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.040]  So it's all available.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:50.261]  We have the Info Wars Daily Digestive Pack, 50% off.
[01:41:50.261 --> 01:41:53.241]  On the Carnivore, it'll help digest meat and protein.
[01:41:53.241 --> 01:41:55.942]  And the Florali 15 billion, a great probiotic deal.
[01:41:55.942 --> 01:41:57.162]  It's an amazing deal.
[01:41:57.162 --> 01:41:57.942]  And so much more.
[01:41:57.942 --> 01:42:00.023]  We also have a new partnership with Spike Tactical.
[01:42:00.023 --> 01:42:06.004]  SpikeTactical.com, with all their top-of-the-line rifles and accessories, Patriot-owned, all made in America.
[01:42:06.784 --> 01:42:08.786]  Uh, that is 5% off.
[01:42:08.786 --> 01:42:12.549]  Additionally, that's us with some of the Spikes Tactical Gear here in Austin, Texas.
[01:42:12.549 --> 01:42:14.691]  We never kind of cycle through the end of the promo, though.
[01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:15.632]  Maybe, it's not your fault.
[01:42:15.632 --> 01:42:17.053]  I always go to it next to a break.
[01:42:17.053 --> 01:42:19.495]  Maybe we should go to the end of the promo so folks can see some of that.
[01:42:19.495 --> 01:42:23.178]  And see our own buddy Tim Fuget there.
[01:42:23.178 --> 01:42:25.100]  And Pat loves wearing those pink glasses as a joke.
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.501]  That's Pat, one of the crew members there.
[01:42:27.501 --> 01:42:31.323]  They've got just all these amazing, amazing firearms.
[01:42:31.323 --> 01:42:34.605]  So, they've got the compressor, the suppressors, all of it.
[01:42:34.605 --> 01:42:44.291]  Infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139, or SpotsTactical.com, and then a percentage of the proceeds of that goes to fund us.
[01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.431]  Again, we'll be right back.
[01:42:45.431 --> 01:42:48.333]  Infowars.com is the main news site.
[01:42:48.333 --> 01:42:51.475]  PrisonPlanet.tv, I want to thank you all for being members there as well.
[01:42:51.475 --> 01:42:53.696]  We'll be back with the giant news, I promise, straight ahead.
[01:42:57.711 --> 01:43:05.195]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:05.195 --> 01:43:18.401]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:19.341 --> 01:43:31.237]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:31.237 --> 01:43:37.204]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:46.972]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:43:46.972 --> 01:43:55.138]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:01.387]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:01.387 --> 01:44:09.473]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:09.473 --> 01:44:14.756]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:44:14.756 --> 01:44:17.298]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:17.298 --> 01:44:21.521]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:23.963]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:44:24.643 --> 01:44:31.868]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:44:31.868 --> 01:44:39.952]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:39.952 --> 01:44:47.137]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:44:47.137 --> 01:44:48.598]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:44:48.598 --> 01:44:50.399]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:54.687]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:44:54.687 --> 01:44:56.411]  That's Infowarslife.com
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.164]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:03.164 --> 01:45:08.888]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.

[01:46:18.207 --> 01:46:24.489]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:46:24.489 --> 01:46:25.270]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:28.431]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:30.612]  And so much more.
[01:46:30.612 --> 01:46:31.973]  It is concentrated.
[01:46:31.973 --> 01:46:33.794]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:46:33.794 --> 01:46:39.517]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:46:39.517 --> 01:46:40.738]  A citrus peel blend.

[01:46:42.759 --> 01:46:45.340]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:46.781]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:46:46.781 --> 01:46:49.143]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:46:49.143 --> 01:46:49.843]  Immune Wall.

[01:47:01.579 --> 01:47:04.204]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.317 --> 01:47:26.222]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:26.222 --> 01:47:27.984]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.984 --> 01:47:30.667]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:30.667 --> 01:47:35.132]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[01:47:45.931 --> 01:47:57.916]  I've covered a lot of crazy, bizarre, but real news over the years, and I gotta tell you, this one tops them all.
[01:47:57.916 --> 01:48:02.878]  Because it's so in your face, but at the same time, so stealthy.
[01:48:02.878 --> 01:48:05.339]  And I'll explain in a moment.
[01:48:05.339 --> 01:48:07.040]  Here's the article, it's on Infowars.com.
[01:48:08.473 --> 01:48:11.636]  We're about to exclusively play the video.
[01:48:11.636 --> 01:48:21.624]  This aired live over the weekend, but no one picked it up, no one paid attention, no one thought it was a big deal, because it was beta-tested, targeting the perfect audience.
[01:48:21.624 --> 01:48:23.105]  Exclusive!
[01:48:23.105 --> 01:48:32.853]  ESPN admits to watching you through your television, Ultimate Big Brother Technology, rolled out on unsuspecting fans.
[01:48:32.853 --> 01:48:35.335]  And then we've got the patents and the backstory of it,
[01:48:36.715 --> 01:48:43.873]  So we're not just going to give you the story first, we're going to give you the rest of the story so as a population we can have a debate about this.
[01:48:43.873 --> 01:48:44.715]  But I wanted to read...
[01:48:46.052 --> 01:48:50.934]  From the early chapters of 1984, which is not an owner's manual.
[01:48:50.934 --> 01:48:53.295]  Somebody ought to explain that to the technocracy.
[01:48:53.295 --> 01:49:08.441]  This is former OSS propagandist and super spy Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, head of the Communist Party in England at the time, writing about what they were planning after he defected
[01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:13.544]  Back to the West, and then blew their entire operation, causing thousands of arrests.
[01:49:13.544 --> 01:49:15.405]  That's just recently been declassified.
[01:49:15.405 --> 01:49:29.414]  So let's hear from the former head of the Communist Party, UK, head of the Fabian Socialists, which was the Communist Party, who decided to stop their plan because they were theorizing all this, and he later wrote non-fiction books before he died, or white papers admitting it.
[01:49:29.414 --> 01:49:33.997]  So let's read the quote by the top super spy, double agent.
[01:49:33.997 --> 01:49:37.439]  He thought of the telescreens with its never-sleeping ear.
[01:49:39.468 --> 01:49:45.299]  They would spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head, you could still outwit them.
[01:49:45.299 --> 01:49:50.930]  With all their cleverness, they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking.
[01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:55.121]  Facts at any rate could not be kept hidden.
[01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.982]  They could be tracked down by inquiry.
[01:49:56.982 --> 01:49:59.023]  They could be squeezed out of you by torture.
[01:49:59.023 --> 01:50:06.748]  But if the object was not to stay alive, but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make?
[01:50:06.748 --> 01:50:09.310]  They could not alter your feelings for that matter.
[01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:12.912]  You could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to.
[01:50:12.912 --> 01:50:26.963]  They could lay bare the utmost detail, everything that you had done or said or thought, but the inner heart, those workings were mysterious, even to yourself, remained impregnable.
[01:50:26.963 --> 01:50:31.907]  And then he thinks he's having sex with his girlfriend, even in the woods, and of course he wasn't, they were videotaping that.
[01:50:31.907 --> 01:50:35.210]  Now, that's a really smart guy telling you what they were planning.
[01:50:37.734 --> 01:50:45.178]  And Aldous Huxley wrote his Brave New World and later Brave New World revisited and said, oh, my brother actually runs the UN program, we're really going to do this.
[01:50:45.178 --> 01:50:47.279]  So, and today they're doing it.
[01:50:47.279 --> 01:50:50.761]  So, here's the article on Infowars.com in the video.
[01:50:50.761 --> 01:50:53.863]  Exclusive ESPN admits to watching you through your TV.
[01:50:53.863 --> 01:50:56.284]  Now, there's all these patents and the
[01:50:58.539 --> 01:51:02.283]  Owners Manuals and the Terms of Service when you get a quote new TV, it's really a computer.
[01:51:02.283 --> 01:51:04.084]  Do you think a smart phone's a computer?
[01:51:04.084 --> 01:51:05.666]  No, these are big computers.
[01:51:05.666 --> 01:51:07.748]  Says we're selling your data, we're watching you.
[01:51:07.748 --> 01:51:10.150]  All the big smart TV companies for four years.
[01:51:10.150 --> 01:51:12.232]  Paul Watson broke that four years ago.
[01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:17.277]  But Samsung said watch what you say, we're watching, we're listening, we're videotaping you, and we're selling the data.
[01:51:18.098 --> 01:51:19.859]  The third parties and governments.
[01:51:19.859 --> 01:51:25.303]  And the news was, look, Kuk Infowars doesn't like the fact we're watching.
[01:51:25.303 --> 01:51:27.785]  But see, it's one thing to admit it's in the terms of service.
[01:51:27.785 --> 01:51:29.206]  It's another thing to roll it out.
[01:51:29.206 --> 01:51:30.067]  Well, how do you do it?
[01:51:30.067 --> 01:51:34.710]  You don't say we're going to have a debate about TVs watching you and security concerns, now hackers can get in.
[01:51:34.710 --> 01:51:35.871]  No, no, you don't do that.
[01:51:37.028 --> 01:51:39.690]  You just suddenly... Oh!
[01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:41.852]  Your TiVo's watching what you do in real time.
[01:51:41.852 --> 01:51:44.254]  That was, you know, back in 2004 with Janet Jackson.
[01:51:44.254 --> 01:51:45.956]  It knows what you're watching, what you're doing.
[01:51:45.956 --> 01:51:48.178]  It can erase stuff off your DVR.
[01:51:48.178 --> 01:51:52.501]  Well, all these years later... 14 years later...
[01:51:55.157 --> 01:51:57.418]  Now they go, oh, look at our Serbian player.
[01:51:57.418 --> 01:51:58.819]  He's amazing.
[01:51:58.819 --> 01:52:00.940]  We'll show you the video in a moment.
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:02.281]  He's an amazing individual.
[01:52:02.281 --> 01:52:04.202]  Let's look at his family.
[01:52:04.202 --> 01:52:12.227]  Thanks to the amazing technology of new smart TVs, let's look at them inside their house in Serbia right now.
[01:52:12.227 --> 01:52:18.711]  Now again, that's just them rolling out to you that TVs are watching you and TVs are listening.
[01:52:18.711 --> 01:52:22.773]  So what this is, is a propaganda piece.
[01:52:22.773 --> 01:52:23.694]  So this is how the listener
[01:52:24.921 --> 01:52:26.261]  Saw it and sent it to us.
[01:52:26.261 --> 01:52:32.724]  Saturday night, I was watching the Arizona NCAA basketball game with Bill Walton, the color guy.
[01:52:32.724 --> 01:52:35.224]  You'd have to find this.
[01:52:35.224 --> 01:52:38.966]  They flashed a family of one of the players watching the game in a living room.
[01:52:38.966 --> 01:52:40.066]  It was an odd photo.
[01:52:40.066 --> 01:52:42.807]  No one was smiling and looking obviously oblivious.
[01:52:42.807 --> 01:52:48.429]  Get this, Bill Walton, the useful idiot, said that it was taken with incredible new technology through the television.
[01:52:49.366 --> 01:52:54.308]  Talk about slipping it in there and breaking it to us when we're unaware.
[01:52:54.308 --> 01:52:55.068]  Insane.
[01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:56.909]  You gotta find this clip.
[01:52:56.909 --> 01:52:58.309]  Well, thank you, sir, because we did.
[01:52:58.309 --> 01:53:00.690]  Now, let's get into it.
[01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:01.711]  I have all the patents.
[01:53:01.711 --> 01:53:03.952]  I have all the facts.
[01:53:03.952 --> 01:53:09.574]  They'll come out and say we made this up or that's no big deal because they don't want you to have a debate about it.
[01:53:09.574 --> 01:53:12.435]  But we have the patent where the entire screen
[01:53:15.035 --> 01:53:22.602]  Uh, is, is a chip, basically, that takes your photo, and they have little cameras hidden in the middle that take your photo.
[01:53:22.602 --> 01:53:24.384]  We can put those news articles up on screen.
[01:53:24.384 --> 01:53:26.026]  We have them all in the news article.
[01:53:26.026 --> 01:53:35.054]  But the point is they admit they're watching and listening to you, and now they're rolling it out on national television.
[01:53:35.054 --> 01:53:36.856]  And here's one of the patents from 2012.
[01:53:39.343 --> 01:53:42.384]  Where the LED display itself is the camera.
[01:53:42.384 --> 01:53:44.745]  So you can't turn it off, you can't deactivate it.
[01:53:44.745 --> 01:53:47.766]  The screen itself is the camera.
[01:53:47.766 --> 01:53:49.207]  We'll get into that patent number, US13-989,655.
[01:53:49.207 --> 01:53:56.390]  There's hundreds of these and the CIA chief admitting they're doing it.
[01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:59.731]  The point is though, this is how they're rolling it out.
[01:53:59.731 --> 01:54:05.874]  So let's go ahead and show the clip here of this unfolding.
[01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:09.892]  And then we'll get into the particular player and the rest of it.
[01:54:09.892 --> 01:54:10.892]  Here it is.
[01:54:10.892 --> 01:54:11.592]  Shows it to him.
[01:54:11.592 --> 01:54:12.232]  Comes right back.
[01:54:12.232 --> 01:54:15.413]  Go one way and come back in the other and get in the air.
[01:54:15.413 --> 01:54:18.414]  This guy is a perfect example of a conference of champions.
[01:54:18.414 --> 01:54:21.935]  His hometown, northwest of Belgrade, the capital.
[01:54:21.935 --> 01:54:26.176]  350,000 people right there on the Danube River and tonight...
[01:54:27.036 --> 01:54:30.177]  Their family, his family, is watching in the living room at home.
[01:54:30.177 --> 01:54:37.579]  And one of the great new technologies that we have here at ESPN is that we can look at you in your house through your TV.
[01:54:37.579 --> 01:54:38.899]  So, hi everybody!
[01:54:38.899 --> 01:54:40.380]  It's 6 in the morning there.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:42.981]  They're watching right now at 6 a.m.
[01:54:42.981 --> 01:54:46.141]  Oh, and it's even, I guess they're a Muslim family, so it's cuter.
[01:54:46.141 --> 01:54:51.563]  You know, the Muslims that came in through Albania, took over most of the area, kill all the Christians that don't convert.
[01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:57.294]  And so you got the little girl there in the burka, so this is even more liberal.
[01:54:57.294 --> 01:55:00.635]  This is, put little girls in hoods, this is even better.
[01:55:00.635 --> 01:55:04.756]  So, this Arizona Wildcats versus USC Trojans college basketball game.
[01:55:04.756 --> 01:55:09.537]  Player, Dusan Ristic, center for the Arizona Wildcats.
[01:55:09.537 --> 01:55:13.157]  You just saw it for yourself.
[01:55:13.157 --> 01:55:19.278]  And they just slip it in where even when I talk about it, it's a game, they're having fun, it's a family.
[01:55:19.278 --> 01:55:22.219]  And they do it to wow you and go, oh look, they're in another country.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:28.628]  Isn't this just all fun?
[01:55:28.628 --> 01:55:33.196]  And so you see these folks that until just the last 50 years and four different invasions were Christians.
[01:55:36.806 --> 01:55:43.553]  And you've got the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Muslims all sitting there, and they won't be in another generation because it's forced, and it's just a total invasion.
[01:55:43.553 --> 01:55:48.779]  And again, if people were invading Africa and taking over, making people convert to something, I'd be against it.
[01:55:48.779 --> 01:55:50.982]  But it's just, everything's propaganda now.
[01:55:50.982 --> 01:55:58.210]  We've got the Muslim family, and oh look, we snapped a picture of them through their TV, thanks to the great new technology, and of course it's all just a big computer.
[01:55:58.650 --> 01:55:59.991]  You're like, oh, it's just like Skype.
[01:55:59.991 --> 01:56:09.677]  It's just like, yeah, but it's two-way, and you can't turn it off, and I've got all the patents, and we told you about it first, and does anybody care about this?
[01:56:09.677 --> 01:56:14.600]  Remember when I covered this in 2012, CIA chief will spawn you through your dishwasher?
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:22.244]  And remember then, three years ago, Comey said, oh, I cover up my webcam, because people can dial in and hack that.
[01:56:22.244 --> 01:56:26.087]  Yeah, it's not just the government, or corporations are the real ones doing it, it's the criminals!
[01:56:28.422 --> 01:56:29.823]  There's another one!
[01:56:29.823 --> 01:56:34.887]  Washington Times, Big Brother Alert, Cameras in the Cable Box to Monitor TV Viewers, 2013.
[01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:38.309]  We broke all this in 1997.
[01:56:38.309 --> 01:56:43.493]  We had the first articles in the early 10,000s, early 2000s, and we're just breaking it all.
[01:56:43.493 --> 01:56:52.359]  But remember Tevo, Jackson's stunt, most replayed moment ever, and I said, see, it's watching what you watch and tracking you, but that's nothing compared to how it's totally
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.161]  Controlling your life and physically watching you.
[01:56:57.161 --> 01:56:58.101]  And here's another one.
[01:56:58.101 --> 01:57:01.363]  CIA turned Samsung smart TVs into listening devices.
[01:57:01.363 --> 01:57:04.584]  That just broke last year in the latest CIA hacks.
[01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:05.425]  Well, of course they are.
[01:57:05.425 --> 01:57:08.006]  Because the TV is designed to do it.
[01:57:08.006 --> 01:57:10.687]  Why your smart TV is the perfect way to spy on you.
[01:57:10.687 --> 01:57:11.488]  London Telegraph.
[01:57:12.248 --> 01:57:26.405]  Last year, but again, I told you this 20 years ago, and my only point is, I told you they'd incrementally just put it in place, and then announce it, probably through sports, like it's fun and no big deal, and your children are growing up like it's not even a big deal!
[01:57:27.746 --> 01:57:35.635]  At least the George Orwell-Winston Smith character in 1984 recognizes it, but he says in the book, Oh, but the children, they're growing into this.
[01:57:35.635 --> 01:57:37.216]  They don't even know the difference.
[01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:41.981]  With another generation or two, it'll be impossible for humanity to ever awaken again.
[01:57:41.981 --> 01:57:43.763]  And that's the plan.
[01:57:43.763 --> 01:57:45.885]  Total soul-sucking.
[01:57:45.885 --> 01:57:46.406]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.546 --> 01:57:51.029]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:57:51.029 --> 01:58:02.537]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[01:58:02.537 --> 01:58:03.437]  This is Pollen Block.
[01:58:04.438 --> 01:58:17.106]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:58:17.106 --> 01:58:21.428]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:25.431]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[01:58:25.911 --> 01:58:36.001]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[01:59:51.574 --> 02:00:01.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.836 --> 02:00:12.299]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[02:00:12.299 --> 02:00:17.400]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.996 --> 02:00:29.438]  All I want is a future for my children and your children.
[02:00:29.438 --> 02:00:44.129]  But we have to be individuals so we can't be controlled by false combines, corporations, cults and groups that want to overwrite what our true cultural and genetic background expression is.
[02:00:44.129 --> 02:00:45.250]  Because that is slavery.
[02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:54.897]  We have to come together in new systems that are organically produced and directed by the true spirit and beauty and will of the people guided by God's spirit.
[02:00:58.339 --> 02:01:00.360]  God's hand.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.440]  God's finger.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.360]  And that's where we are.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:06.841]  And you see the Vatican coming out and saying, we worship communism.
[02:01:06.841 --> 02:01:08.322]  It is the ultimate form of goodness.
[02:01:08.322 --> 02:01:10.282]  China is so loving to its people.
[02:01:10.282 --> 02:01:11.983]  And you're like, this is upside down.
[02:01:11.983 --> 02:01:14.183]  That's what Satanism is.
[02:01:14.183 --> 02:01:23.326]  Torturing small children to death and drinking their blood while they beg for mommy over long periods of time is liberal and loving and a sacrament of the modern Catholic Church because it's not
[02:01:24.554 --> 02:01:27.617]  Christian, it's not Catholic, it's globalists that have taken it over.
[02:01:27.617 --> 02:01:32.121]  Vatican, China, best example of church and social doctrine.
[02:01:32.121 --> 02:01:37.927]  And then today, hundreds of child porn images, LSD, ecstasy found in Boise Priest's home.
[02:01:37.927 --> 02:01:48.758]  Prosecutor says, well how they found out about him is he was trying to get online to find people who would help him kidnap because he desired to rape and kill children.
[02:01:49.861 --> 02:01:58.989]  Prosecutor Kathleen Guzman said in the probable cause hearing earlier, you like how pedophile arrest and devil worshipper arrest are up.
[02:01:58.989 --> 02:02:00.110]  I've got to do the numbers.
[02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:01.051]  I looked at it last year.
[02:02:01.051 --> 02:02:04.534]  It's like 400% last time I checked.
[02:02:04.534 --> 02:02:09.538]  And the media has all these headlines, Jones is hoaxing people.
[02:02:09.538 --> 02:02:12.861]  There's no move against pedophiles.
[02:02:12.861 --> 02:02:14.643]  Well, tell that to Prosecutor Guzman.
[02:02:16.647 --> 02:02:33.252]  Because you can bet, as they kick the door in on ringleaders, see what Trump's doing with the Patriots and the intelligence agencies that are Patriots, there's bad guys in there too, but in the white hat secret societies as they're called, it isn't just the FBI liberals that call it a secret society, that's all these agencies are.
[02:02:33.252 --> 02:02:37.974]  There's like a 50 CIA, 6 or 7 big ones I know of, 5 FBI's.
[02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:50.894]  There's a leftist FBI, a communist FBI, a Christian FBI, a veteran FBI, a Mormon FBI, and a lot of them overlap each other.
[02:02:50.894 --> 02:02:52.155]  There's a straight-up FBI.
[02:02:52.155 --> 02:02:56.337]  Most of those people end up just doing the grunt work.
[02:02:56.337 --> 02:02:57.437]  Oh, you're a good person?
[02:02:57.437 --> 02:03:02.699]  Oh, you really care about... Oh, you'll deal with bank robberies and kidnappings when they come up and white-collar crime.
[02:03:02.699 --> 02:03:03.520]  Bye-bye.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:06.241]  Oh, no, you go deal with some guy that stole a million dollars, not a billion.
[02:03:06.241 --> 02:03:07.001]  You just go over there.
[02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:08.302]  That's how it works.
[02:03:08.302 --> 02:03:09.002]  And that's how it works.
[02:03:09.952 --> 02:03:14.996]  It's all test.
[02:03:14.996 --> 02:03:21.302]  But it's just like Christ on the cross next to the thief.
[02:03:21.302 --> 02:03:23.083]  One guy listens to him and the other doesn't.
[02:03:23.083 --> 02:03:25.205]  The other guy says, I want absolution.
[02:03:25.205 --> 02:03:26.486]  I want to be with you in paradise.
[02:03:26.486 --> 02:03:28.928]  He says, you'll be with me tonight in paradise.
[02:03:28.928 --> 02:03:30.489]  He gives up the ghost.
[02:03:30.489 --> 02:03:34.032]  Because I know people who aren't bad souls.
[02:03:35.615 --> 02:03:39.196]  Who've done a lot of horrible things, but it's like King David's spirit.
[02:03:39.196 --> 02:03:44.817]  He did it because of the circumstance, the system, the seduction, the peer pressure, the deception.
[02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:49.258]  But when the deception was revealed, they understood and repented and were generally bad.
[02:03:49.258 --> 02:03:53.178]  It didn't mean they did bad things when, oh, I repent, the little magic ceremony.
[02:03:53.178 --> 02:04:00.840]  It meant they actually did repent and then saw it and then didn't do it again.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:01.700]  At least that sin.
[02:04:03.797 --> 02:04:07.840]  But some of the best people fighting evil are those that have done evil.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.501]  Because they know how the enemy operates.
[02:04:09.501 --> 02:04:10.441]  They know the lies.
[02:04:10.441 --> 02:04:13.223]  They know how you don't get power out of it.
[02:04:13.223 --> 02:04:21.609]  You get... Affliction.
[02:04:21.609 --> 02:04:22.449]  That's the archetype.
[02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:31.457]  It's why for all the cheesiness of Star Wars, they went and did Joseph Campbell stuff and Carl Jung, the emperor, to get his power.
[02:04:31.457 --> 02:04:39.746]  Darth Vader, any of it, has to lose arms, legs, be mutated, be ugly, like Hitler being nerve gas in World War I, to get the power they have to give up their humanity, they have to become ugly.
[02:04:41.530 --> 02:04:44.154]  You can't have something beautiful and pure that does all this evil.
[02:04:44.154 --> 02:04:48.420]  You can get the power, but you're going to give up your real power to get it.
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.106]  The only question is how many of us were evil for a while before we pulled out and kept some of our humanity.
[02:04:53.106 --> 02:04:53.727]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.727 --> 02:04:54.108]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.607 --> 02:05:02.592]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:05:02.592 --> 02:05:06.735]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:05:06.735 --> 02:05:13.001]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:05:14.782 --> 02:05:21.926]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:05:21.926 --> 02:05:27.769]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:05:27.769 --> 02:05:39.916]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:05:40.596 --> 02:05:46.879]  Makaru from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.

[02:06:07.555 --> 02:06:12.225]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.781 --> 02:06:20.285]  Do you agree with Nancy Pelosi when she says he wants to make America white again and that's what this is about?
[02:06:20.285 --> 02:06:23.428]  I think a lot of President Trump's rhetoric is racist.
[02:06:23.428 --> 02:06:29.473]  And let's be very clear.
[02:06:29.473 --> 02:06:35.037]  When someone uses the phrase chained migration, it is intentional in trying to demonize families.
[02:06:35.037 --> 02:06:38.760]  Literally trying to demonize families and make it a racist slur.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.581]  It is not right.
[02:06:39.761 --> 02:06:40.602]  We're good to go.
[02:06:55.319 --> 02:07:03.925]  Why is it that the Democrats think Americans are dying to listen to them turn any term they can get their grubby little paws on into a weapon of racism?
[02:07:03.925 --> 02:07:18.575]  One would think that for every person duped into being angry about the term chain migration, there are five people furious that a white senator would even twist the words chain migration in order to foment racism and division.
[02:07:18.575 --> 02:07:24.619]  My friend who's a great comedy writer, Jim Downey, he's accused of being a right-wing writer, a comedy writer, if there is such a thing.
[02:07:25.739 --> 02:07:29.322]  He says, no, no, I just think the way that the Democrats handle things is poor.
[02:07:29.322 --> 02:07:37.469]  The way they try to pick out little pieces of a population that, well, we represent the Hispanics, we represent the LGBT or something.
[02:07:37.469 --> 02:07:39.811]  And they're not speaking to everyone at once.
[02:07:39.811 --> 02:07:45.695]  And it's almost demeaning to say, I'm choosing you because you're a splinter group or you're a certain minority group.
[02:07:46.936 --> 02:07:55.260]  There's almost a resentment that somehow you're separated again by a politician, you know, that you're my people, I'm in control of you, I represent you.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:08:03.485]  Instead of thinking that each citizen has a right to be respected as a citizen first, someone under the laws of the country.
[02:08:03.485 --> 02:08:13.850]  Chain migration simply means that legalized or green card carrying family members are able to sponsor immigrant family members, thus creating a chain that goes on forever.
[02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.671]  But the Democrats think otherwise.
[02:08:15.971 --> 02:08:18.792]  I have sinned against you, my lord.
[02:08:18.792 --> 02:08:34.837]  Like a guilty TV evangelist that won't let up on pornography, the minds of the Democrats are brimming with racism as a means to play political football, inserting their virtues signaling madness into an immigration debate that requires compromise and sanity.
[02:08:34.837 --> 02:08:45.161]  I think chain migration is another word that's been weaponized by critics, mostly on the right of the debate, to sort of generate ill will toward immigrants, even those who are coming legally.
[02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:56.981]  You're saying when they get here, because these people are more vulnerable, if they come in on this program, they're then subject to exploitation more easily?
[02:08:56.981 --> 02:09:00.022]  What I'm saying is... We're just not getting the nexus to terrorism.
[02:09:00.022 --> 02:09:07.264]  The nexus to terrorism is that if you have a visa program, it is easily exploited by malafide actors, including terrorists.
[02:09:07.264 --> 02:09:08.545]  But you don't understand that.
[02:09:09.325 --> 02:09:09.766]  I don't know.
[02:09:09.766 --> 02:09:12.548]  He didn't come in on the visa lottery program.
[02:09:12.548 --> 02:09:14.910]  He came in as an extended family-based immigrant.
[02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:32.385]  But I'm saying with respect to the diversity visa program, which is also at play here, that program is, as the State Department IG found 15 years ago, and as the GAO confirmed in 2007, exploitable by terrorists or malafide actors because the criteria are so low and easily faked.
[02:09:33.986 --> 02:09:34.847]  It's a lottery.
[02:09:34.847 --> 02:09:37.510]  So, there's multiple levels.
[02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:39.192]  It's just, it's an open door.
[02:09:39.192 --> 02:09:39.953]  It's problematic.
[02:09:39.953 --> 02:09:41.275]  It needs to shut.
[02:09:41.275 --> 02:09:49.644]  The White House website reports under our current immigration system, around 70% of legal immigrants admitted to the United States every year
[02:09:49.864 --> 02:09:53.206]  Do so based on family ties rather than merit.
[02:09:53.206 --> 02:10:07.052]  A recent joint report from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security found that roughly three in four individuals convicted of international terrorism-related charges since September 11, 2001 were foreign-born.
[02:10:07.052 --> 02:10:16.117]  As the report outlines, a number of these terrorists were able to enter the United States on the basis of family ties and extended family chain migration.
[02:10:16.317 --> 02:10:25.145]  This is why the average American cringes whenever the Democrats speak, touting their vague racist sentiments over our national security.
[02:10:25.145 --> 02:10:34.673]  Don't you think most Americans were a wee bit insulted after former President Obama chose a portrait artist that depicted black people beheading white people?
[02:10:34.673 --> 02:10:37.075]  Is that what the Democrats call unity?
[02:10:37.075 --> 02:10:39.918]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:10:42.645 --> 02:10:50.153]  It's the Democratic Party that opposed the Civil Rights Act of Eisenhower and of Richard Nixon when he was Vice President.
[02:10:50.153 --> 02:10:59.643]  It's the Democratic Party that threatened my grandmother and called us n-word lovers in East Texas because they were for desegregation.
[02:10:59.643 --> 02:11:00.764]  And it was their great victory
[02:11:01.755 --> 02:11:13.323]  To then, after the Republican Southern Strategy, to come in and rebrand themselves as the ones fighting racism, but they just taught all the minorities how to be incredible, tribal, racist, hate-mongers.
[02:11:13.323 --> 02:11:20.568]  And so, now you've got the Democratic Party openly, massively pushing race war in this country.
[02:11:20.568 --> 02:11:25.032]  It is truly sickening, and it shows how diabolical they are.
[02:11:25.032 --> 02:11:26.052]  Roger Stone's here with us.
[02:11:26.052 --> 02:11:28.614]  We're gonna go to other topics in a moment, but just putting bookends on this.
[02:11:30.583 --> 02:11:36.648]  Chain migration with the State Department under the UN, previously told Trump killed this six months ago.
[02:11:36.648 --> 02:11:41.292]  Under Obama, the UN, this is mainstream news, decided who was allowed to come in.
[02:11:41.292 --> 02:11:53.402]  They certified it under the migrant operation, and then they brought the people in who would have many convictions, 30, 40 deportations, rapes, murders, killings, and then the left gets up there.
[02:11:53.402 --> 02:11:58.406]  When I can't go to Mexico and get free healthcare or be a criminal and allowed in, or I have to leave when they sack, I can't go anywhere.
[02:11:58.626 --> 02:12:04.614]  But the idea that if we have a border and vet anybody, when we're so open that we're bad, people aren't buying this!
[02:12:16.710 --> 02:12:17.331]  We're good to go.
[02:12:38.104 --> 02:12:38.925]  African-Americans.
[02:12:38.925 --> 02:12:40.746]  Because they want a kept population.
[02:12:40.746 --> 02:12:41.166]  It's true.
[02:12:41.166 --> 02:12:45.850]  It's the Republicans who are good, a lot of bad ones, that are trying to emancipate people.
[02:12:45.850 --> 02:12:58.479]  It's the Democrats of the KKK trying to keep them under control and spewing all the race crap, knowing it's going to turn the average white person racist when they see the president on TV with a guy showing black women cutting white people's heads off.
[02:12:58.479 --> 02:13:01.101]  And I'm telling folks not to buy into this, but this is getting ridiculous.
[02:13:01.701 --> 02:13:13.367]  You know, what's interesting and heartening to me as I travel, Alex, is that I find more and more individual black people, just people, who come up to me and say, you know, you're absolutely right.
[02:13:13.367 --> 02:13:15.408]  The Democrats left us behind.
[02:13:15.408 --> 02:13:16.688]  We like what you're saying.
[02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:18.309]  We want to own a piece of the American pie.
[02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:22.870]  I want to own my own factory, a guy said to me when I was in Florida.
[02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:24.991]  I don't want to be an employee.
[02:13:24.991 --> 02:13:26.231]  I want to be an employer.
[02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:30.472]  And notice Trump kept showing, not the little cliche of, look, this black guy's a doctor.
[02:13:30.472 --> 02:13:31.532]  Of course black guy can be a doctor.
[02:13:31.532 --> 02:13:36.353]  Of course the left made fun of the black brain surgeon that Trump has hired.
[02:13:36.353 --> 02:13:37.954]  Oh, actually he's just a total black guy.
[02:13:37.954 --> 02:13:44.835]  Trump showed all those black entrepreneurs from nowhere that have hundreds and hundreds of employees and are making all this money and helping America.
[02:13:44.835 --> 02:13:47.596]  He was lionizing the black entrepreneur.
[02:13:47.596 --> 02:13:48.176]  That's what they hate.
[02:13:48.436 --> 02:13:52.101]  No, the Democratic Party is the party of the poverty pimps.
[02:13:52.101 --> 02:14:05.258]  They seek to make black people reliant on the welfare state, as opposed to proposing policies that are pro-growth and pro-opportunity.
[02:14:05.458 --> 02:14:18.125]  Let me ask you this, what do you make of Bill Murray coming out and saying political correctness is evil, it's suppressing minorities, it's turning him into just an identity instead of a person, that there's leaders they put over him that basically control them and enslave them?
[02:14:18.125 --> 02:14:21.566]  I mean, he clearly went out on a limb here with the facts.
[02:14:21.566 --> 02:14:26.349]  I mean, he's right about the facts, but they're going to try to attack him even though he's, quote, a leftist icon.
[02:14:26.349 --> 02:14:29.310]  He can now see what's going on and speaking out against him.
[02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:30.451]  That's got to really shake him up.
[02:14:30.831 --> 02:14:33.834]  Well, I also think the context is important because he's absolutely right.
[02:14:33.834 --> 02:14:38.058]  It makes comedy impossible to do because they're hypersensitive.
[02:14:38.058 --> 02:14:39.599]  You can't make a joke.
[02:14:39.599 --> 02:14:41.060]  There are no jokes.
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:42.742]  They take everything verbatim.
[02:14:42.742 --> 02:14:45.485]  When I was in England, I just heard the same thing over and over again.
[02:14:45.485 --> 02:14:46.005]  Racist!
[02:14:46.005 --> 02:14:46.445]  Racist!
[02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:46.826]  Racist!
[02:14:46.826 --> 02:14:47.526]  You're a racist!
[02:14:47.526 --> 02:14:48.367]  You're a racist!
[02:14:48.367 --> 02:14:49.028]  You're a Russian!
[02:14:49.028 --> 02:14:49.668]  You're a racist!
[02:14:49.668 --> 02:14:50.189]  You're a racist!
[02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.809]  You're a Russian!
[02:14:50.809 --> 02:14:52.291]  They slide the Russian thing in there.
[02:14:52.671 --> 02:14:52.932]  No.
[02:14:52.932 --> 02:14:55.856]  It's like seven or eight racists and then a Russian.
[02:14:55.856 --> 02:14:57.378]  But they're the racists.
[02:14:57.378 --> 02:14:59.501]  They're the ones who gave us the 1994 crime bill.
[02:14:59.501 --> 02:15:00.943]  It is ours.
[02:15:00.943 --> 02:15:03.266]  I guess the next thing is going to be rapists.
[02:15:03.266 --> 02:15:03.927]  That fits them.
[02:15:03.927 --> 02:15:05.449]  Russian rapists.
[02:15:05.449 --> 02:15:09.154]  I mean, look, the 1994 crime bill was given to us by Bill and Hillary.
[02:15:09.915 --> 02:15:19.258]  You know, if you are caught with rock cocaine, the mandatory penalties are much harsher than if you are caught with powdered cocaine.
[02:15:19.258 --> 02:15:20.759]  This is a Clinton policy.
[02:15:20.759 --> 02:15:22.539]  That is a racist policy.
[02:15:22.539 --> 02:15:24.940]  It was Hillary who played the dog whistle.
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:28.942]  It was Hillary who said black people needed to be brought to heel.
[02:15:28.942 --> 02:15:29.982]  So I'm heartened.
[02:15:29.982 --> 02:15:37.144]  Yesterday there was a terrific demonstration against a number of Republican pastors against the Congressional Black Caucus.
[02:15:37.144 --> 02:15:38.585]  That community is waking up.
[02:15:39.758 --> 02:15:40.239]  That's right.
[02:15:40.239 --> 02:15:44.305]  And of course, when you were talking about the crime bill, she said blacks are animals that have to be controlled.
[02:15:44.305 --> 02:15:46.088]  Horrible racist stuff with video.
[02:15:46.088 --> 02:15:49.874]  Google then would, Clinton crime bill, would block that and not let you see it.
[02:15:49.874 --> 02:15:50.555]  So they're Googles.
[02:15:50.555 --> 02:15:51.776]  They're trying to cover up what she said.
[02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:52.518]  Blacks were animals.
[02:15:52.518 --> 02:15:53.119]  We'll be back.
[02:15:55.509 --> 02:16:01.373]  Here's a special message for those of you who owe the IRS at least $10,000 or more in back taxes.

[02:17:00.402 --> 02:17:02.363]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:17:57.785 --> 02:18:00.387]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[02:18:00.387 --> 02:18:15.000]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:22.547]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:18:23.087 --> 02:18:34.250]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:40.492]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:18:40.492 --> 02:18:42.913]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:18:43.653 --> 02:18:50.498]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:18:50.498 --> 02:18:55.041]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:56.363 --> 02:19:16.333]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:19:16.333 --> 02:19:18.474]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:19:18.474 --> 02:19:22.456]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:22.456 --> 02:19:23.477]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[02:19:59.119 --> 02:20:09.943]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.943 --> 02:20:10.823]  Just some good ol' boys.
[02:20:10.823 --> 02:20:12.464]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.464 --> 02:20:14.125]  Just a good ol' boy.
[02:20:14.125 --> 02:20:15.825]  Never meanin' no harm.
[02:20:15.825 --> 02:20:17.106]  Never meanin' no harm.
[02:20:20.054 --> 02:20:30.201]  The mountain might get them, but the establishment never will.
[02:20:30.201 --> 02:20:31.361]  God's the mountain.
[02:20:48.283 --> 02:20:52.348]  We're under God's plan, not the establishment.
[02:20:52.348 --> 02:20:54.991]  There's some good old boys.
[02:20:54.991 --> 02:20:56.312]  You know, my mama loves me.
[02:20:56.312 --> 02:20:58.555]  All right, we're back live here.
[02:20:58.555 --> 02:21:03.921]  Roger Stone riding a shotgun with me to this hour, right into the next hour, right into the next hour.
[02:21:05.905 --> 02:21:12.167]  Roger, former head of the Trump campaign, best-selling author, political strategist, best buddies of Richard Nixon, you name it.
[02:21:12.167 --> 02:21:15.367]  The only member of the Plumbers not to go to jail because you weren't involved.
[02:21:15.367 --> 02:21:18.968]  A piece of living history here with us, involved in 10 campaigns.
[02:21:18.968 --> 02:21:20.169]  Big stuff during the break.
[02:21:20.169 --> 02:21:24.630]  You're about to give folks, I know next hour we host the fourth hour, but start giving us the hors d'oeuvre.
[02:21:26.042 --> 02:21:36.566]  Or all of your great aplomb about the huge moment we're at and the battle inside Trumplandia and the things that are unfolding right now.
[02:21:36.566 --> 02:21:43.388]  Well, Alex, I think the truth is General John Kelly is toast.
[02:21:43.388 --> 02:21:49.350]  I think there's evidence... By the way, you said that first six months ago, but now it's... But now I think it's manifest.
[02:21:49.350 --> 02:21:55.252]  It's very clear that he knew about the allegations of spousal abuse against Rob Porter.
[02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:58.733]  Uh, and that he promoted Porter anyway.
[02:21:58.733 --> 02:22:11.548]  The reason for this is because Kelly aspires to be Secretary of Defense sometime in the next two to three years, and you can't leave a position in Trump world unless you have someone to take your place.
[02:22:11.548 --> 02:22:14.231]  So Porter was being groomed to be the next
[02:22:14.771 --> 02:22:15.992]  White House Chief of Staff.
[02:22:15.992 --> 02:22:28.662]  Porter has been one of those staffers actively involved in blocking the President from seeing InfoWars, The Daily Caller, Breitbart, any conservative alternative media, Gateway Pundit, a lot of other... But particularly InfoWars.
[02:22:28.662 --> 02:22:33.245]  Particularly, because we don't want the President to learn any inconvenient truths.
[02:22:33.245 --> 02:22:38.610]  He might watch InfoWars and get the facts, and then when he gets the facts, he acts on them.
[02:22:38.610 --> 02:22:40.291]  He says, why are we doing this?
[02:22:40.291 --> 02:22:41.472]  Or how come I don't know about this?
[02:22:42.012 --> 02:22:47.074]  So, they try to make their lives easier by hiding certain things from the President.
[02:22:47.074 --> 02:22:51.896]  Now the question is, who will replace Kelly?
[02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:57.098]  And there's a number of factions kind of swirling around with their own candidates.
[02:22:57.098 --> 02:23:01.000]  And the President, being Donald Trump, is playing his cards very close to the vest.
[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:09.085]  We can confirm that he asked Tom Barrack, the chairman of Colony Capital, a real estate opportunity fund in Los Angeles.
[02:23:09.085 --> 02:23:09.726]  His best friend.
[02:23:09.726 --> 02:23:11.247]  Barrack's literally his best friend.
[02:23:11.247 --> 02:23:12.568]  He's the B.B.
[02:23:12.568 --> 02:23:14.789]  Robozo of this administration.
[02:23:14.789 --> 02:23:19.332]  Someone the president confides in, someone the president trusts completely.
[02:23:19.332 --> 02:23:28.479]  But Mr. Barrack, who had a bad experience in government during the Reagan days, you know, and who's worth a couple billion on his own, declined this high honor.
[02:23:28.979 --> 02:23:33.781]  He'll support the President in any way he can, but he's kind of a shadow consigliere.
[02:23:33.781 --> 02:23:41.983]  I think he's someone the President goes to for solid advice, and somebody the President knows he can speak to, and there's zero chance of a leak.
[02:23:41.983 --> 02:23:44.244]  Tom Barrack's the most loyal guy in the world.
[02:23:44.244 --> 02:23:50.866]  He's an enormously capable guy, and he'd be a great White House Chief of Staff, but I don't think he is interested in the job.
[02:23:50.866 --> 02:23:52.587]  He's not a sadomasochist.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:58.403]  Well, he's also, you know, his loyalty is to Donald Trump personally.
[02:23:58.403 --> 02:24:02.906]  And he knows that this is combat duty at his age and his station of life.
[02:24:02.906 --> 02:24:04.787]  I don't think he wants to take this on.
[02:24:04.787 --> 02:24:06.989]  And same thing Trump almost did because of this.
[02:24:06.989 --> 02:24:09.030]  And people say, OK, Chief of Staff, who cares?
[02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:11.432]  The point is, is it's now all coming out.
[02:24:11.432 --> 02:24:15.234]  Kelly's now, you know, free game out there with what's happening.
[02:24:15.234 --> 02:24:16.115]  How does this affect
[02:24:17.923 --> 02:24:27.045]  Well, we gotta hope that the new White House Chief of Staff, depending on who that is, it will lift the Iron Curtain.
[02:24:27.045 --> 02:24:38.488]  I mean, I had somebody, a good friend, a friend of this show, who was with the President at Mar-a-Lago and said that he has these four guys who go everywhere and they're like minders.
[02:24:38.488 --> 02:24:40.388]  They look identical, they dress identical.
[02:24:41.228 --> 02:24:45.670]  Their job is to intercept anybody who's trying to talk to or give anything to the president.
[02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:54.912]  If you're having a conversation with the president, say, in a cocktail party type setting, they're suddenly there, you know, with their ears.
[02:24:54.912 --> 02:24:59.954]  If you try to hand the president something, a letter, a piece of paper, they'll say, I'll take that.
[02:24:59.954 --> 02:25:03.255]  So, you know, they're trying to keep the president in a cocoon.
[02:25:03.255 --> 02:25:04.255]  I've known him 40 years.
[02:25:04.255 --> 02:25:06.036]  He doesn't like being in a cocoon.
[02:25:06.596 --> 02:25:08.257]  He likes to know everything.
[02:25:08.257 --> 02:25:14.639]  And when he finds out things that he should have known, but nobody told him, that really makes him angry.
[02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.920]  So, who are they talking about?
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:19.361]  Jack Posobiec likes Congressman Gates, your friend.
[02:25:19.361 --> 02:25:22.061]  Well, Matt Gates, I think, is a great guy.
[02:25:22.061 --> 02:25:30.464]  I think he's of great value to us in Congress, because unlike most of those guys, with the obvious exceptions of Trey Gowdy... He's not a coward.
[02:25:30.464 --> 02:25:31.865]  So I'm asking you, who is good then?
[02:25:32.105 --> 02:25:34.246]  Well, let's see, a number of people here.
[02:25:34.246 --> 02:25:40.727]  David Urban, who is allegedly in line for the job of ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was considered previously.
[02:25:40.727 --> 02:25:42.448]  He's a Trump loyalist.
[02:25:42.448 --> 02:25:46.809]  Some people believe that they misunderstand his politics.
[02:25:46.809 --> 02:25:49.070]  He was the chief of staff to Senator Arlen Specter.
[02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:52.792]  Who is the toughest, smartest, most difficult member of the Senate?
[02:25:52.792 --> 02:25:57.536]  If you can manage the Senate Office of Ireland's Secretary, you can manage the White House.
[02:25:57.536 --> 02:25:59.537]  Whether Urban would take the job, I don't know.
[02:25:59.537 --> 02:26:06.803]  Wayne Berman, veteran Republican rainmaker, veteran of both the Reagan and Bush administrations.
[02:26:06.803 --> 02:26:09.505]  Sean Hannity's been advocating Berman.
[02:26:09.505 --> 02:26:16.450]  Mick Mulvaney, current member of the Cabinet, although I think he aspires to go back home and run for Governor.
[02:26:16.450 --> 02:26:17.931]  Those are some of the names.
[02:26:17.931 --> 02:26:18.872]  So let's shift gears then.
[02:26:19.212 --> 02:26:20.593]  The big issue.
[02:26:20.593 --> 02:26:26.317]  Talk about Benedict Arnold marries Judas Iscariot and has an evil goblin baby.
[02:26:26.317 --> 02:26:29.118]  Bannon is on TV saying, oh, women are taking over.
[02:26:29.118 --> 02:26:30.199]  Trump's a misogynist.
[02:26:30.199 --> 02:26:32.200]  He's the ultimate leftist now, darling.
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:40.145]  But he goes on Breitbart Radio still and goes, I love the president, I love the president, to that audience, and then runs around stabbing him in the back, just foaming at the mouth.
[02:26:40.145 --> 02:26:48.591]  And the word is, and I've been hearing this, that he is, like, making stuff up to the council, even though he wasn't involved in the campaign when all this Russia stuff supposedly happened.
[02:26:49.552 --> 02:26:51.034]  I don't believe... How about Baby Bannon?
[02:26:51.034 --> 02:26:52.175]  We're talking about Steve Bannon.
[02:26:52.175 --> 02:27:04.090]  Look, as I've said here, pardon me, Bannon's actions are a stunning betrayal to a man who elevated him to the highest possible honors you could have in public service.
[02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:07.715]  And I understand that he is cooperating with Mueller.
[02:27:08.235 --> 02:27:11.236]  I believe he has an interview with Mueller this week.
[02:27:11.236 --> 02:27:14.557]  But I don't believe this has anything whatsoever to do with Russia, Alex.
[02:27:14.557 --> 02:27:21.279]  I think that he is trying to entrap the president in some kind of business-related thing.
[02:27:21.279 --> 02:27:25.660]  You've been saying don't meet with him, and now the White House lawyers had said they would meet, now they're saying no, no.
[02:27:26.542 --> 02:27:28.403]  The lawyers come around to my point of view.
[02:27:28.403 --> 02:27:29.544]  That's absolutely true.
[02:27:29.544 --> 02:27:32.526]  Where the president is on this, we still don't know.
[02:27:32.526 --> 02:27:34.667]  But being Donald Trump, he left himself that out.
[02:27:34.667 --> 02:27:40.130]  Even when he said, I'll meet with Mueller, I'm not afraid to meet with Mueller, subject of course to the agreement of my lawyers.
[02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:42.092]  So he left himself an out.
[02:27:42.092 --> 02:27:43.913]  This is the most obvious perjury trap.
[02:27:43.913 --> 02:27:46.174]  Mueller ought to have his ass indicted.
[02:27:46.174 --> 02:27:49.816]  And all these FBI top people giving money to Fusion GPS.
[02:27:49.816 --> 02:27:53.579]  I said that was always the issue of Justice Department funding that, Hillary giving,
[02:27:54.919 --> 02:27:56.460]  McCabe's wife of half a million.
[02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:59.662]  They ought to all be indicted right now, man.
[02:27:59.662 --> 02:28:00.922]  Arrogant.
[02:28:00.922 --> 02:28:02.603]  There's no question about this.
[02:28:02.603 --> 02:28:09.947]  I don't think that the Trump administration can survive until the president gets control of his own Justice Department.
[02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:12.288]  He does not have control of the Justice Department.
[02:28:12.288 --> 02:28:13.409]  And what do they have on?
[02:28:15.129 --> 02:28:17.310]  On the Attorney General.
[02:28:17.310 --> 02:28:19.530]  He's just... He's out to lunch.
[02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:23.711]  I can't tell whether he is compromised, Alex, or whether he is senile.
[02:28:23.711 --> 02:28:25.311]  Addled?
[02:28:25.311 --> 02:28:27.672]  Maybe had a stroke?
[02:28:27.672 --> 02:28:28.592]  But he's not himself.
[02:28:28.592 --> 02:28:30.812]  He's not the guy I knew in the campaign.
[02:28:30.812 --> 02:28:33.793]  He's not the guy who was really the leader on immigration issues.
[02:28:33.793 --> 02:28:34.973]  He's a different person.
[02:28:34.973 --> 02:28:39.254]  That means that Rod Rosenstein continues to be the de facto Attorney General.
[02:28:39.254 --> 02:28:40.334]  And that guy is a rat.
[02:28:40.754 --> 02:28:41.595]  He is a quizlet.
[02:28:41.595 --> 02:28:50.624]  He was one of the key captains running the whole fake Russiagate situation who created the special turdlet known as Robert Globalist Butt Boy.
[02:28:50.624 --> 02:28:51.105]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.689 --> 02:28:58.252]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:28:58.252 --> 02:29:00.394]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:29:00.394 --> 02:29:02.375]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:29:02.375 --> 02:29:04.437]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[02:29:56.710 --> 02:30:00.193]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:30:00.193 --> 02:30:11.701]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:30:11.701 --> 02:30:12.622]  This is Pollen Block.
[02:30:13.602 --> 02:30:26.266]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[02:30:26.266 --> 02:30:30.588]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:34.609]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet.
[02:30:35.069 --> 02:30:39.532]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:01.368 --> 02:31:05.152]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:31:05.152 --> 02:31:09.717]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:31:09.717 --> 02:31:12.861]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:31:12.861 --> 02:31:15.964]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:31:17.478 --> 02:31:30.301]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:45.364]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:31:46.365 --> 02:31:50.070]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it can do for your family.
[02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:52.374]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:31:52.374 --> 02:31:54.637]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:31:56.628 --> 02:32:01.773]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:32:01.773 --> 02:32:06.558]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:32:06.558 --> 02:32:15.246]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:32:15.246 --> 02:32:18.589]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:23.972]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:32:23.972 --> 02:32:31.275]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:32:31.275 --> 02:32:35.197]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:32:35.197 --> 02:32:39.920]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:43.482]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[02:32:44.142 --> 02:32:45.624]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.989 --> 02:33:19.850]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:19.850 --> 02:33:26.174]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.174 --> 02:33:33.519]  All right, I was talking to Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, Trump confidant, about what he thinks Trump's doing wrong.
[02:33:33.519 --> 02:33:36.300]  Because we can talk about what Trump's doing good all day.
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:39.602]  We know he's a good guy over all the globos for attacking and they're out to get him.
[02:33:41.377 --> 02:33:45.220]  We were talking during the break and I was making the points that Rand Paul's right.
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:46.841]  We've got too much debt.
[02:33:46.841 --> 02:33:49.422]  But China's had five times the debt.
[02:33:49.422 --> 02:33:52.144]  When you actually look at their rigged economy, they're expanding.
[02:33:52.144 --> 02:33:54.005]  They're building real infrastructure.
[02:33:54.005 --> 02:33:55.907]  And we're in a debt war right now.
[02:33:55.907 --> 02:33:57.588]  And the whole world's just going into more debt.
[02:33:57.588 --> 02:33:58.829]  So now it's fiat.
[02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:05.233]  If we use debt building to actually rebuild infrastructure, we know that creates real jobs that are based on people.
[02:34:05.233 --> 02:34:07.314]  And America was built with bubbles.
[02:34:07.314 --> 02:34:08.735]  Let's not lie about that.
[02:34:08.735 --> 02:34:10.917]  And then I see Roy Blankfein of Goldman Sachs.
[02:34:12.078 --> 02:34:19.825]  Bragging earlier last year saying, oh, I was in China, their infrastructure is much bigger, much better, you know, you can forget it.
[02:34:19.825 --> 02:34:21.627]  And so I'm for infrastructure.
[02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:23.769]  So I understand Rand Paul's perspective.
[02:34:23.769 --> 02:34:25.150]  I understand the other perspective.
[02:34:26.482 --> 02:34:31.924]  Beyond being a pragmatist, I'm looking at the reality of how they're trying to maneuver the U.S.
[02:34:31.924 --> 02:34:33.964]  into being de-industrialized, being shut down.
[02:34:33.964 --> 02:34:35.505]  I see the exuberance.
[02:34:35.505 --> 02:34:38.425]  I see everything coming back with them trying to block it.
[02:34:38.425 --> 02:34:47.468]  So, you could say Trump's right to go ahead and let there be a bubble for the people to build infrastructure and bring back optimism, especially all the other countries are going to keep inflating anyway, so it's not going to matter.
[02:34:48.288 --> 02:34:54.173]  The problem is, though, that then it's Goldman Sachs again who's trying to sabotage it.
[02:34:54.173 --> 02:34:57.056]  Well, they can't just stop the funding from happening.
[02:34:57.056 --> 02:35:01.019]  They'll make sure it goes to what they want and does nothing.
[02:35:01.019 --> 02:35:04.342]  Because they've got a big raging, you know what, for this country.
[02:35:04.342 --> 02:35:05.563]  They run the whole New World Order.
[02:35:05.563 --> 02:35:07.985]  They run the whole Hollywood globalist system.
[02:35:07.985 --> 02:35:11.708]  And the very same globalist funded the takedown of Russia before.
[02:35:11.708 --> 02:35:13.850]  This is the takedown of America so they can dictate
[02:35:14.470 --> 02:35:17.131]  The terms of surrender to the people, this globalist clique.
[02:35:17.131 --> 02:35:22.294]  So, where do you stand in that whole navigation of that situation?
[02:35:22.294 --> 02:35:30.318]  Making the right decision to accelerate the economy, like a shot to the heart of adrenaline, the defibrillator isn't working, the person's gonna die, hit him with adrenaline, get it going.
[02:35:30.318 --> 02:35:33.199]  He hit us with a small shot, it got us going, we're getting better.
[02:35:33.199 --> 02:35:36.500]  They're trying to bring us back into a coma, he's back with the shot again.
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:41.483]  Again, how do you describe that whole situation?
[02:35:42.003 --> 02:35:44.804]  Well, first of all, let's talk about what the President's done right.
[02:35:44.804 --> 02:35:57.067]  This tax cut, the biggest tax cut in American history, even though the House and Senate Republicans did load it up with some Christmas tree aspects for Wall Street, is still going to turbocharge the economy.
[02:35:57.067 --> 02:36:01.708]  It still has the potential, once it gets traction, to really, I think,
[02:36:02.748 --> 02:36:08.551]  Put us in a great position for 2018 and beyond politically, plus get the economy really cooking.
[02:36:08.551 --> 02:36:12.854]  If they give the president his plan for inversion, that will only speed things up.
[02:36:12.854 --> 02:36:18.217]  I must tell you, though, Alex, I'm very disappointed in the infrastructure proposal that he unveiled yesterday.
[02:36:18.217 --> 02:36:21.439]  This was written by Goldman Sachs.
[02:36:21.439 --> 02:36:24.201]  What it does is it shifts responsibilities back to the states.
[02:36:24.821 --> 02:36:31.966]  It gives mandates to the states, it forces the states into public-private partnerships, but it doesn't give the states anything.
[02:36:31.966 --> 02:36:35.729]  It doesn't give them a line of credit, it doesn't give them any funding.
[02:36:35.729 --> 02:36:40.052]  It's an excuse for Goldman Sachs to sell more muni bonds, is what it is.
[02:36:40.052 --> 02:36:42.513]  Now this is the brainchild of Gary Cohn.
[02:36:42.513 --> 02:36:44.194]  Let me remind you who he is.
[02:36:44.194 --> 02:36:46.136]  So instead of nationalism, we'll talk about him.
[02:36:46.556 --> 02:36:51.498]  Instead of nationalism, it's globalism, in run around Trump, right to the states.
[02:36:51.498 --> 02:36:52.179]  Exactly.
[02:36:52.179 --> 02:36:56.081]  And what they've done here, remember, Gary Cohn is the President's Chief Economic Advisor.
[02:36:56.081 --> 02:37:00.203]  He's the guy who wanted the President to sign the Paris Climate Accord.
[02:37:00.203 --> 02:37:02.724]  And he openly bad-mouths the President when he thinks he's not watching.
[02:37:03.204 --> 02:37:08.128]  He also is the guy who wanted the carbon tax credits.
[02:37:08.128 --> 02:37:09.789]  Tried to sell the President on that.
[02:37:09.789 --> 02:37:10.689]  Rejected.
[02:37:10.689 --> 02:37:14.352]  Now Mr. Cohen would very much like to be the White House Chief of Staff.
[02:37:14.352 --> 02:37:18.995]  I believe he is the candidate of the President's son-in-law and daughter.
[02:37:18.995 --> 02:37:22.617]  And he's a liberal Democrat from Goldman Sachs.
[02:37:22.617 --> 02:37:25.119]  This would be a classic mistake.
[02:37:25.119 --> 02:37:27.581]  And I think rank-and-file Trump supporters would revolt.
[02:37:28.672 --> 02:37:32.898]  Expanding on that, Netanyahu obviously is a friend of America overall.
[02:37:32.898 --> 02:37:36.362]  People demonize him so much because they don't like him as a nationalist.
[02:37:36.362 --> 02:37:42.190]  They're trying to indict him for his wife having government chefs for dignitary meetings cook food at their house.
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:45.895]  I thought presidents... I mean, that's the dirt they've got.
[02:37:46.876 --> 02:37:49.299]  And so now the police want indictments.
[02:37:49.299 --> 02:37:50.300]  They want to take him out.
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:52.302]  It's in the Soros documents of WikiLeaks.
[02:37:52.302 --> 02:37:55.726]  They want to overthrow Israel and have the UN come in with the Vatican.
[02:37:55.726 --> 02:38:01.633]  I mean, all these Israel haters better get it through their head that that's just a bunch of PR hype.
[02:38:01.633 --> 02:38:05.497]  Israel's a bunch of different diverse groups of political views and religious views.
[02:38:06.198 --> 02:38:14.223]  And, you know, Saudi Arabia won't take one Palestinian or one Muslim from Syria or Libya.
[02:38:14.223 --> 02:38:19.026]  And so this, I mean, you can see they're trying to take down nationalists everywhere.
[02:38:19.026 --> 02:38:26.170]  Hillary's in an article today on Infowars.com, I hadn't gotten to, where they say, we will, you know, have the new world order.
[02:38:26.170 --> 02:38:26.930]  We're going to win.
[02:38:26.930 --> 02:38:28.371]  I forgot to cover that.
[02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:30.212]  You know, we're unstoppable.
[02:38:30.212 --> 02:38:32.213]  I mean, it's so obvious what's happening.
[02:38:32.213 --> 02:38:32.834]  What do you make of that?
[02:38:33.609 --> 02:38:35.590]  Well, look, they're fighting the tide of history.
[02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:36.811]  That's their problem.
[02:38:36.811 --> 02:38:41.633]  What's amazing, in all honesty, was you talk about Russian interference in our election.
[02:38:41.633 --> 02:38:49.437]  The Obama administration poured hundreds of millions of dollars and deeply interfered in the Israeli elections to take down Netanyahu's party.
[02:38:49.437 --> 02:38:52.059]  And they failed, against all odds.
[02:38:52.059 --> 02:38:55.301]  This is their plan B, these trumped-up, ridiculous charges.
[02:38:56.522 --> 02:38:57.823]  He gave a gratuity to a chef.
[02:38:57.823 --> 02:38:58.665]  Let's put him in jail.
[02:38:58.665 --> 02:38:59.907]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:38:59.907 --> 02:39:01.228]  It's absurd.
[02:39:01.228 --> 02:39:06.095]  But he's emerging as a major Trump ally.
[02:39:06.095 --> 02:39:10.742]  If you watch that joint press conference with the president last week, you notice where they went.
[02:39:11.503 --> 02:39:27.906]  Immediately, he praises the president for moving the capital to Jerusalem, and then the president goes into a direct attack on the Iranian nuclear deal, which is the greatest fraud in American history, and now he says, Mr. President, we have your back.
[02:39:27.906 --> 02:39:31.787]  If you decide to unravel that, we are with you.
[02:39:31.787 --> 02:39:34.148]  This is the kind of guy you may have to deal with.
[02:39:34.148 --> 02:39:37.308]  Because, again, racist on all sides.
[02:39:37.308 --> 02:39:40.769]  Racist blacks say all whites are bad, and racist whites say all blacks are bad, or whatever.
[02:39:41.249 --> 02:39:57.055]  But really, you look at the Nazi collaborator Soros documents and all the rest of it, it's all these weird, crazy, anti-Jewish, leftist Jews who have a fetish for bringing down Israel and a fetish for attacking the West, Christianity, any of it.
[02:39:57.055 --> 02:39:59.136]  What are they getting out of it?
[02:39:59.136 --> 02:40:05.359]  Why do they, in this little tiny country, want to blow it up and hand it over to people that will be killing each other forever, fighting over who controls it?
[02:40:05.879 --> 02:40:13.486]  And like, since when does NBC and CNN praise North Korea, how beautiful the dictator's daughter is, and how horrible our vice president is?
[02:40:13.486 --> 02:40:16.788]  I mean, it's not North Korea buttering their bread.
[02:40:16.788 --> 02:40:19.751]  Where is the hatred of America and the love of North Korea?
[02:40:19.751 --> 02:40:21.953]  Why just hate Israel for no reason?
[02:40:21.953 --> 02:40:26.577]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on, and it's like so crazy.
[02:40:28.362 --> 02:40:31.203]  But it's really, I hate to say it, it's all about Trump.
[02:40:31.203 --> 02:40:34.123]  In other words, anything he is for, they're against.
[02:40:34.123 --> 02:40:44.806]  They weren't upset when Barack Obama was picked up on a hot mic saying to Vladimir Putin, wait till after the elections, I'll have much more flexibility in giving you whatever you want, essentially.
[02:40:44.806 --> 02:40:45.586]  Where were they then?
[02:40:45.586 --> 02:40:47.126]  Why weren't they going crazy then?
[02:40:47.126 --> 02:40:48.927]  Can you imagine if Trump said that?
[02:40:48.927 --> 02:40:53.488]  David Brock yesterday announces that he's filing a complaint with the FEC over allegations
[02:40:54.368 --> 02:40:58.771]  That the president had sex with a porn star and then paid her off.
[02:40:58.771 --> 02:41:03.634]  Brock, where were you when Bill Clinton paid $750,000 to Paula Jones?
[02:41:03.634 --> 02:41:10.498]  That was a non-consensual... Even if Trump did that, it's not a Federal Elections Commission violation.
[02:41:10.498 --> 02:41:13.860]  Twelve years ago, something like that happened.
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:16.902]  It's absurd, but there's no consistency there.
[02:41:16.902 --> 02:41:19.084]  In other words, these people are demented.
[02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:27.107]  I mean, if it was like an airplane full of small children with Bill Clinton and Jerry Epstein... No, then that wouldn't be an issue.
[02:41:27.107 --> 02:41:28.187]  You've got to cover that up.
[02:41:28.187 --> 02:41:28.588]  Yeah.
[02:41:28.588 --> 02:41:31.309]  No, look, it's the hypocrisy of these people.
[02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:33.129]  I mean, the whole left would want to cover that up.
[02:41:33.129 --> 02:41:36.670]  The hypocrisy of this is extraordinary.
[02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:40.652]  So where is it all going as they just battle and battle and get crazier and crazier?
[02:41:41.738 --> 02:41:52.885]  Well, the way this usually works, unfortunately, is when you have an outsider like Donald Trump, first they try to discredit you, then they try to destabilize you, and then they co-opt you.
[02:41:52.885 --> 02:41:54.886]  Sure, there's some things I'm disappointed in.
[02:41:54.886 --> 02:41:56.787]  I don't know why we're still in Syria.
[02:41:56.787 --> 02:41:58.848]  I don't know why we're still in Afghanistan.
[02:41:58.848 --> 02:42:02.150]  I think the generals are misleading the president on that.
[02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:06.093]  Yes, everything in Afghanistan will collapse when we withdraw.
[02:42:06.093 --> 02:42:08.114]  But that's true if we withdraw tomorrow?
[02:42:08.294 --> 02:42:17.600]  It's a collapse-filled society of inbred, let's just, the facts are they're almost all inbred mental patient cavemen from planet Pop-Tart.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:23.344]  Right, and it's all going to collapse into the toilet when we leave, no matter when that is.
[02:42:23.344 --> 02:42:28.867]  So we're just buying time with American dollars, which are borrowed, and American lives.
[02:42:28.867 --> 02:42:29.868]  Makes no sense to me.
[02:42:29.868 --> 02:42:35.492]  The president was elected as a non-interventionist on the foreign policy front.
[02:42:35.492 --> 02:42:35.992]  He's got the
[02:42:36.372 --> 02:42:39.435]  Well, the globalists just use it as a way to sap the U.S.
[02:42:39.435 --> 02:42:43.659]  We pull out, it'll make Pakistan and China go in there and get sapped even worse.
[02:42:43.659 --> 02:42:51.267]  It's a sabotage against our country that we're even in, cesspool, crap hole, you-know-what hole, devil's den.
[02:42:51.267 --> 02:42:52.428]  We'll be right back, stay with us.

[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:02.273]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:19.967]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[02:47:19.967 --> 02:47:24.693]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[02:47:24.693 --> 02:47:29.338]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:47:29.338 --> 02:47:32.743]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[02:47:33.743 --> 02:47:34.884]  All right, Roger Stone is here.
[02:47:34.884 --> 02:47:38.426]  He's going to be hosting the 4th Hour right under the war room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:47:38.426 --> 02:47:40.727]  Doing some plugging, I said, hey, I got a plug coming in.
[02:47:40.727 --> 02:47:42.928]  He said, oh, I want to talk about Brain Force.
[02:47:42.928 --> 02:47:45.590]  I've tried a lot of nootropics, a lot of natural brain pills.
[02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:48.992]  I know you're into herbology and Chinese medicine, the rest of it.
[02:47:48.992 --> 02:47:57.636]  But we just set out looking at whatever the best sellers were already, fusing two or three of the top brands together, and then cutting the price massively.
[02:47:57.636 --> 02:47:58.957]  So you're getting one of $50, $60, $70 nootropic.
[02:48:00.858 --> 02:48:03.459]  For like $30 right now, Brain Force Plus.
[02:48:03.459 --> 02:48:05.699]  Tell folks what you think about it.
[02:48:05.699 --> 02:48:06.460]  Here's the thing.
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:10.601]  I just did a tour of the United Kingdom where it was intense.
[02:48:10.601 --> 02:48:12.261]  I did three major speeches.
[02:48:12.261 --> 02:48:15.842]  I did Oxford, I did Durham, and I did Cambridge.
[02:48:15.842 --> 02:48:23.745]  And then I did media events in between, including an extraordinary beatdown of the BBC where they tried to trip me up and I destroyed them.
[02:48:23.745 --> 02:48:25.705]  It wouldn't have been possible without Brain Force.
[02:48:25.705 --> 02:48:27.966]  The thing I like about this, Alex, is it gives you
[02:48:28.746 --> 02:48:36.331]  A mental clarity and a mental lift, the ability to work another six hours, but then you're not so amped up that you can't sleep.
[02:48:36.331 --> 02:48:38.573]  It has no carryover effect.
[02:48:38.573 --> 02:48:40.975]  You're not jittery, you're not amped up.
[02:48:40.975 --> 02:48:47.339]  You can sleep that night and then I pop one as soon as I start to have mental fatigue and I'm like, oh, I'm done for the day.
[02:48:47.339 --> 02:48:49.240]  Two of these and you're like back on the rampart.
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:55.605]  And I was about to say, I was bragging that I hadn't had the flu in like eight years, but this is the record since like 1999.
[02:48:55.605 --> 02:48:58.127]  Boom, got it three days ago and I've still been at work.
[02:48:58.627 --> 02:49:05.454]  All the rest of it, I said, man, I am, I am dying because I had coffee this morning and a little bit of tea, uh, you know, iced tea with lunch.
[02:49:05.454 --> 02:49:08.857]  We got Cabo Bob's today for the crew for Valentine's Day for everybody.
[02:49:08.857 --> 02:49:11.700]  Uh, and you know, great local joint of Patriots.
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:13.762]  You're like, dude, your own product, Brain Force.
[02:49:13.762 --> 02:49:14.703]  Let's take one.
[02:49:14.703 --> 02:49:15.724]  So we're doing it right now.
[02:49:16.404 --> 02:49:22.869]  Not as a staged event here, this is what we're really doing because I got a long way to go and a short time to get there and a lot of work behind the scenes.
[02:49:22.869 --> 02:49:27.513]  He's about to be hosting for hours and hours and I, you know, fever went away yesterday.
[02:49:27.513 --> 02:49:34.117]  I was up here with 101 fever or so on air, 103 the day before, but I still feel like I've been run over by a freight train today.
[02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:37.561]  Everybody else has been getting this stuff sick for a week.
[02:49:37.561 --> 02:49:38.742]  I'm blessed.
[02:49:38.742 --> 02:49:47.730]  I had the flu and it's my own fault because I should have gotten immune wall sooner than I did and it hung on for a month and then when I hit the immune wall
[02:49:48.797 --> 02:49:54.198]  Uh, which, and it's the olive, it's the olive leaf oil that's in there, which is really hard to find in a quality.
[02:49:54.198 --> 02:49:55.339]  Uh, I turned the corner on that.
[02:49:55.339 --> 02:49:56.199]  See, you know your stuff.
[02:49:56.199 --> 02:50:03.901]  That's why you ought to be on, like, ahead of our operations promotions, because you, you really are, and I've seen your suitcases full of this stuff, and like you said, wow, your stuff really is top line.
[02:50:03.901 --> 02:50:08.562]  Now, we go out and, you're right, if I took, see, I'm so arrogant, and I was saying this last week before I got sick.
[02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:11.310]  I'm like, I've got the flu and everybody else has it, see?
[02:50:11.310 --> 02:50:14.051]  And I go, but I don't even take my own stuff because there's so much of it.
[02:50:14.051 --> 02:50:18.292]  I take the X2 always, and then I take some rainforest when I need it, and I take Supermel here and there.
[02:50:18.292 --> 02:50:20.393]  And I've got all these, but there's so many great products.
[02:50:20.393 --> 02:50:24.454]  I'm like, I have been taking the allergy pollen blocks, it's really helped.
[02:50:24.454 --> 02:50:27.435]  But then I ask myself, wow, allergies today, oh, where's my pollen block?
[02:50:27.435 --> 02:50:32.416]  It's like crazy, it really works, but we're not, you're like Trump, I'm like Trump, I don't even ever take aspirin.
[02:50:32.416 --> 02:50:34.736]  But this isn't, well, I take aspirin from a plant too.
[02:50:34.736 --> 02:50:36.577]  This is from Mother Nature, we should be taking it more.
[02:50:36.877 --> 02:50:41.862]  Well, if you go back and you looked at our shows on Monday, you know, I was losing my voice.
[02:50:41.862 --> 02:50:50.651]  I was raspy, I was tired, I hit the silver colloidal formula, and my voice... You called me and you said, Bullitt is incredible!
[02:50:50.651 --> 02:51:00.420]  Yeah, it really, his stuff works, a couple chops, I do it, you know... Listen, listen, it was, what was it, Sunday night, it was Sunday night, I did the show, went,
[02:51:01.121 --> 02:51:09.503]  Dropped my children off, they're visiting their mother, and I'm driving home, and I'm like, man, as much as they punched me in the chest, that's where it starts, this flu.
[02:51:09.503 --> 02:51:09.823]  Yep.
[02:51:09.823 --> 02:51:12.683]  And then I went to bed and woke up with a fever, and I just went in and drank half a bottle.
[02:51:12.683 --> 02:51:14.484]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:51:14.484 --> 02:51:20.225]  It is toxic, it's why I kill stuff, but it's approved, all that stuff, and I mean, but approved low dosages.
[02:51:20.225 --> 02:51:23.786]  I went boom, gargled that, and it was like immediately got a lot better.
[02:51:23.786 --> 02:51:26.166]  I think that's why I wasn't so ill as most of the people.
[02:51:26.226 --> 02:51:29.607]  We've had members of the crew that have had a flu in a decade.
[02:51:29.607 --> 02:51:30.668]  They've been sick for two weeks.
[02:51:30.668 --> 02:51:31.628]  Well, it's the synergy.
[02:51:31.628 --> 02:51:40.271]  In other words, if you do mineral fusion, and you stack it with immune wall and the silver colloidal, it just torques up your own natural immunity like that.
[02:51:40.271 --> 02:51:41.092]  You feel like a new person.
[02:51:41.892 --> 02:51:44.613]  Well, silver's an antiviral, it's an antibacterial.
[02:51:44.613 --> 02:51:48.974]  Above 30 parts per million, as they can get it a lot smaller, it is very toxic.
[02:51:48.974 --> 02:51:51.255]  30 parts, it's seen as generally safe.
[02:51:51.255 --> 02:51:52.915]  But all antibiotics are poison, folks.
[02:51:52.915 --> 02:51:53.615]  Let's not lie to you.
[02:51:53.615 --> 02:51:58.617]  You know, but that's why the ancients, every culture said the royalty ate off silver, even above gold.
[02:51:58.617 --> 02:52:05.519]  You know, the silver spoon in the mouth of your baby, because they knew even keeping food in silver containers made it last longer.
[02:52:06.158 --> 02:52:07.880]  Yeah, it's a great product.
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:16.887]  And as you point out, when people, you can go to the drugstore by the way, you can go to Walmart or CVS, and you'll find formulas that say they do the same thing as our stuff.
[02:52:16.887 --> 02:52:29.218]  And by the way... And they use fillers, they use substandard ingredients... Just like the Liberty Movement led this, I remember being on air 23 years ago, and people calling me, because I was like, I don't need vitamins, I don't need nothing, I'm working out every day, I'm in great shape, yeah, I'm 23 years old.
[02:52:30.399 --> 02:52:33.667]  They're like, the coil silver, Alex, is incredible for topical or incredible for that.
[02:52:33.667 --> 02:52:34.389]  I'm like, yeah, whatever.
[02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:35.392]  And finally, I researched it.
[02:52:35.392 --> 02:52:38.038]  My dad's, you know, a doctor, chemist, and world surgeon.
[02:52:38.991 --> 02:52:46.016]  He said, no son, it's an ancient, you know, known antibiotic, you know, it's real, but it's gotta, you can't be too small a particle.
[02:52:46.016 --> 02:52:56.224]  They say it's better, and so I started having the sponsors, and then like 10 years later, you start seeing it at CVS, Walgreens, now you go in hospitals, they're not spraying iodine, they're spraying silver to kill germs, because iodine quit working.
[02:52:56.224 --> 02:52:58.906]  I'm not knocking iodine, I don't want to go on a whole rant, but absolutely.
[02:52:58.906 --> 02:53:05.191]  Infowars, with our audience, we, the Liberty Movement first, we pioneered silver, and like you said, it's everywhere now.
[02:53:05.811 --> 02:53:11.794]  Yeah, it's interesting because the mainstream media makes fun of us for promoting a line of natural supplements.
[02:53:11.794 --> 02:53:15.276]  The point I don't think they get is we have no corporate sponsors.
[02:53:15.276 --> 02:53:17.817]  There's nobody saying, Alex, you can't say that.
[02:53:17.817 --> 02:53:19.798]  Alex, you can't cover that subject.
[02:53:19.798 --> 02:53:21.039]  It's too sensitive.
[02:53:21.039 --> 02:53:24.281]  So it gives us journalistic freedom and it pays for the expansion.
[02:53:24.281 --> 02:53:26.922]  Folks, I have seen the new studio here in construction.
[02:53:27.962 --> 02:53:29.043]  It's state-of-the-art.
[02:53:29.043 --> 02:53:30.384]  It will just blow your mind.
[02:53:30.384 --> 02:53:31.204]  The satellite uplink?
[02:53:31.204 --> 02:53:32.485]  Yeah, it's going to be unreal.
[02:53:32.485 --> 02:53:33.506]  But let's go further.
[02:53:33.506 --> 02:53:37.569]  Jeff Bezos, $112 billion, bought Whole Foods, bought everything.
[02:53:37.569 --> 02:53:38.669]  He's downgrading the quality.
[02:53:38.669 --> 02:53:41.091]  It's his own people that made it.
[02:53:41.091 --> 02:53:44.853]  And Jeff Bezos, I know supplements now.
[02:53:44.853 --> 02:53:48.215]  I mean, I've been into them for 10 years, longer, but I've been really into it for like 7.
[02:53:49.770 --> 02:53:50.690]  I know the brands in there.
[02:53:50.690 --> 02:53:54.431]  I know the manufacturers where they've got $1 in the product and it's $40.
[02:53:54.431 --> 02:53:57.012]  Ours has got $15 a product and it's $35.
[02:53:57.012 --> 02:53:57.552]  I can show it.
[02:53:57.552 --> 02:53:59.613]  I'm going to start showing this with the blurred out contracts.
[02:53:59.613 --> 02:54:01.553]  We've even got people that have agreed to do it at the companies.
[02:54:01.553 --> 02:54:05.454]  And I'm going to show what we're doing at the same factories versus what they're doing.
[02:54:05.454 --> 02:54:16.117]  And then he's got his own Washington Post attacking me saying I'm ripping people off that supplements are a scam when he's the biggest supplement seller in the world and has some great names.
[02:54:16.897 --> 02:54:19.098]  He has the very best in their third party.
[02:54:19.098 --> 02:54:22.140]  He's come out with all his own labeled stuff that's pure crap.
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:22.981]  So I'm coming after him.
[02:54:22.981 --> 02:54:24.822]  I mean, he is just a monster, man.
[02:54:24.822 --> 02:54:25.643]  He is a monster.
[02:54:25.643 --> 02:54:26.944]  He doesn't even want... I hate him.
[02:54:26.944 --> 02:54:28.364]  Just get him off screen.
[02:54:28.364 --> 02:54:33.688]  I like the idea of taking some of the Whole Foods products and combining them with ours and just going head to head in terms of the...
[02:54:33.868 --> 02:54:34.669]  Quality.
[02:54:34.669 --> 02:54:36.089]  We know all the manufacturers.
[02:54:36.089 --> 02:54:37.170]  We know who's making it.
[02:54:37.170 --> 02:54:38.491]  We know who private labels.
[02:54:38.491 --> 02:54:41.613]  So there used to be hundreds of products, a lot of great companies.
[02:54:41.613 --> 02:54:42.954]  Now they're getting rid of all that.
[02:54:42.954 --> 02:54:44.315]  It's all their private label.
[02:54:44.315 --> 02:54:45.716]  It doesn't even say Whole Foods.
[02:54:45.716 --> 02:54:48.338]  They're bringing in to displace everything.
[02:54:48.338 --> 02:54:51.900]  And I'm just saying we know everything he's involved in is crap.
[02:54:51.900 --> 02:54:57.464]  Well, the other thing I think we do that the others do is you constantly are taking the best of the old and the new.
[02:54:57.464 --> 02:54:59.005]  In other words, you get some of the finest
[02:55:00.045 --> 02:55:11.797]  Chinese herbs have been used for centuries and have a proven efficacy, and then you blend them with cutting-edge nutraceuticals that are modern, and you come up with formulas that are really outstanding.
[02:55:11.797 --> 02:55:12.757]  You really are smart.
[02:55:12.757 --> 02:55:14.960]  I'm not just saying that because I didn't know you were this big of an herbologist.
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:16.321]  That's exactly what I want.
[02:55:16.321 --> 02:55:22.427]  Whatever's documented, confirmed, high quality, but whatever the latest, hottest, proven stuff is, so everybody buys it and it works great.
[02:55:22.927 --> 02:55:27.028]  I mean, I want something to really work good, because you're going to want to buy it over and over again.
[02:55:27.028 --> 02:55:28.609]  Doesn't Bezos get that?
[02:55:28.609 --> 02:55:31.149]  Don't sell somebody a bottle of crap.
[02:55:31.149 --> 02:55:33.930]  Sell them something good and they'll buy it for life, but he thinks you're dumb.
[02:55:33.930 --> 02:55:35.370]  Well, go to the testimonials, folks.
[02:55:35.370 --> 02:55:41.112]  You can see on the site, not hundreds, thousands of people who say, I love brain force.
[02:55:41.152 --> 02:55:45.113]  Well here's the special since we did an infomercial, which I never do, which we should do, because it funds the operation.
[02:55:45.113 --> 02:55:46.813]  Please support our local farmers as well.
[02:55:46.813 --> 02:55:49.614]  Limited time sale of CellForce InfoWars Life.

[02:56:00.737 --> 02:56:00.937]  It's
[02:56:15.674 --> 02:56:18.335]  Tell us what's coming up in the next hour you're gonna be hosting, Roger Stone.
[02:56:37.844 --> 02:56:39.946]  Well, we're going to do a total breakdown.
[02:56:39.946 --> 02:56:45.051]  We're going to kind of give a scorecard in the race to become White House Chief of Staff.
[02:56:45.051 --> 02:56:49.895]  Who's in, who's out, who's under consideration, who's taking themselves out of consideration.
[02:56:49.895 --> 02:56:54.099]  We're going to talk about Jeff Sessions, who's now attacking a Republican U.S.
[02:56:54.099 --> 02:56:59.825]  Senator for supporting President Donald Trump's position on state-legalized marijuana.
[02:57:00.305 --> 02:57:03.167]  We're going to bring you the very latest on Julian Assange.
[02:57:03.167 --> 02:57:12.712]  We're waiting with bated breath for a decision by a British court that could lift the outstanding warrant against him and clear the way to freedom.
[02:57:12.712 --> 02:57:15.774]  And we're going to talk about the latest on John Brennan.
[02:57:15.774 --> 02:57:19.796]  John Brennan is the former CIA director and he, Alex, is the perp.
[02:57:20.636 --> 02:57:22.258]  in the entire Russian collusion.
[02:57:22.258 --> 02:57:24.780]  He is the main conspirator.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:33.086]  This is the evil brainchild of this Islamic convert, this traitor, who is now, by the way, a paid consultant.
[02:57:33.086 --> 02:57:40.532]  All right, I'm going to do five more minutes with you because I agree we have to cover Russia to decipher it and expose it, but aren't we in a trap letting them even change the subject?
[02:57:40.532 --> 02:57:43.695]  Haven't they won on Russiagate even though they've failed in a way I'll talk about?

[03:00:04.529 --> 03:00:12.174]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight!
[03:00:12.174 --> 03:00:14.236]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.236 --> 03:00:16.337]  Because there is a war on.
[03:00:16.337 --> 03:00:16.998]  For your mind.
[03:00:23.846 --> 03:00:27.820]  Roger Stone is going to talk about a key question I have at the moment.
[03:00:27.820 --> 03:00:28.282]  He's taking over.
[03:00:28.282 --> 03:00:29.386]  He's going to get in the chair right here.
[03:00:31.198 --> 03:00:38.145]  The head of the war room, he's also going to call us coming up, but we were ranting about Whole Foods during the break and he's like, man, you're really pissed at Bezos.
[03:00:38.145 --> 03:00:44.310]  I'm like, man, the stuff he did to publishing, the stuff he said to us, how he gets all these government contracts, $1.48 on every product he ships.
[03:00:44.310 --> 03:00:45.611]  Nobody else gets that.
[03:00:45.611 --> 03:00:46.953]  How he oppresses everybody.
[03:00:46.953 --> 03:00:54.480]  And then how he's got the Washington Post writing a whole bunch of articles saying, I'm a con artist because I sell supplements when he's the biggest supplement seller in the world.
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:55.400]  He knows they're great.
[03:00:56.141 --> 03:01:16.194]  And then he's adulterating them according to his own employees and lowering the quality, and then you go, oh yeah, let me tell you, just because you would even go in there and you saw what olive leaf extract go from 25, 30 bucks, as it should be, to 70-something dollars, knowing people need it during the cold season, and then realizing, wait, Alex has got it concentrated at a third the price.
[03:01:16.194 --> 03:01:17.035]  Again, that's what I mean.
[03:01:17.035 --> 03:01:22.859]  He gives you adulterated crap for way over the price, and then I guess we are dumb, because the public wants to get F'd.
[03:01:22.859 --> 03:01:25.281]  Well, I won't be like that, man, and I'm sick of Bezos.
[03:01:26.481 --> 03:01:29.504]  Yeah, so I was going to the airport on my way to Austin.
[03:01:29.504 --> 03:01:32.987]  I've still got this residual cough, which is the hangover from the flu.
[03:01:32.987 --> 03:01:40.713]  I beat the flu with immune wall and the silver bullet, but I knew I needed some olive leaf tincture.
[03:01:40.713 --> 03:01:41.434]  You know, it's an oil.
[03:01:41.434 --> 03:01:44.156]  But the Roman soldiers, it's their secret.
[03:01:44.156 --> 03:01:44.276]  $75?
[03:01:44.276 --> 03:01:46.458]  I'm not paying $75.
[03:01:46.458 --> 03:01:48.400]  I put it back and I headed for the airport.
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:51.682]  And again, you said what it used to be just a few years ago was 20, 30 bucks.
[03:01:52.964 --> 03:02:00.232]  So I figured I'd just wait till I got to Austin and get some, which I did.
[03:02:00.232 --> 03:02:01.794]  The guy's a rip-off artist.
[03:02:01.794 --> 03:02:02.695]  It's outrageous.
[03:02:02.695 --> 03:02:04.136]  And the quality is just not there.
[03:02:04.136 --> 03:02:04.356]  He uses
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:08.861]  I'm ranting, but I just don't get the Satanism.
[03:02:31.598 --> 03:02:39.243]  Well, it's also why in the AT&T-Time Warner merger, I don't want them to spin off CNN.
[03:02:39.243 --> 03:02:41.504]  Because I don't want Bezos to buy it.
[03:02:41.504 --> 03:02:43.586]  I don't want Soros to buy it.
[03:02:43.586 --> 03:02:45.847]  I'd like to see them reform it from the inside.
[03:02:45.847 --> 03:02:47.008]  It's not making money.
[03:02:47.008 --> 03:02:48.509]  It's not getting ratings.
[03:02:48.509 --> 03:02:50.870]  This isn't ideologically driven.
[03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:54.153]  The new owners might want to make a profit on their cable news network.
[03:02:55.168 --> 03:02:59.851]  And he used to make money with Tucker Carlson and Pat Buchanan were on there, like, when they used to be 80% global, now it's 20%.
[03:02:59.851 --> 03:03:01.052]  You at least want to debate?
[03:03:01.052 --> 03:03:03.434]  They don't want to debate.
[03:03:03.434 --> 03:03:05.795]  Why do you think Tucker has people on he disagrees with?
[03:03:05.795 --> 03:03:06.876]  Well, and he destroys them.
[03:03:06.876 --> 03:03:13.981]  If you saw that footage of him with the surfer dude congressman from California, Eric Swalwell, he destroyed him.
[03:03:13.981 --> 03:03:17.464]  Well, when he accused him of being a Soviet agent and the Soviet Union doesn't even exist anymore?
[03:03:17.464 --> 03:03:19.185]  Yeah, he was sputtering.
[03:03:19.185 --> 03:03:23.288]  But it just reminds people, don't Swalwell that, it's covered with Schiff.
[03:03:24.446 --> 03:03:48.132]  You know, maybe one more segment or how about when I come back you just you just address it because I understand the Russiagate thing's important because they made it the whole world as you said almost two years ago when they started you said doesn't matter it's not real they're gonna continue to hype it till it's the only issue out there but it doesn't matter if it's disproven because now they've sucked you in
[03:03:49.707 --> 03:03:51.189]  To their argument.
[03:03:51.189 --> 03:04:05.830]  And so I think about the amount of time we've spent on this instead of pre-market, taking care of our veterans, exposing radical Islam, exposing all the high-tech spying, exposing the fluoride in the water, all the things I didn't cover.
[03:04:06.471 --> 03:04:15.337]  Because I defend, it's like if, you know, Congressman Schiff says that, you know, I'm hiding a zoo full of monkeys up my ass.
[03:04:15.337 --> 03:04:18.420]  I shouldn't have to, sorry for that, but that's just what it feels like.
[03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:20.001]  That's what he feels like as a monkey, actually.
[03:04:20.001 --> 03:04:22.623]  You know, it's like, it's ridiculous.
[03:04:22.623 --> 03:04:25.024]  I used to tell you two years ago, stop getting mad.
[03:04:25.024 --> 03:04:26.826]  You know, it's bull until he did it to me, and it's like...
[03:04:27.646 --> 03:04:30.187]  They know it's a lie, and they know they're the globalist traitors.
[03:04:30.187 --> 03:04:31.508]  So now I know why you're pissed.
[03:04:31.508 --> 03:04:33.908]  So when we come back, let's talk about that.
[03:04:33.908 --> 03:04:38.090]  Speaking of Carlson, I'm going to play this powerful clip where he said, how much would you get to be paid to watch CNN?
[03:04:38.090 --> 03:04:38.730]  So that's coming up.
[03:04:38.730 --> 03:04:40.571]  I'm going to get Roger Stone's take on that.
[03:04:40.571 --> 03:04:43.652]  And as they know, with this flu, when you get rid of it, it has this cough for two weeks.
[03:04:43.652 --> 03:04:45.313]  So that's what we're enjoying here.
[03:04:45.313 --> 03:04:47.674]  He'll be moved over here soon with a cough button right here.
[03:04:47.674 --> 03:04:48.454]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.454 --> 03:04:51.535]  And thank you, Lord Bezos, for oxygen.
[03:04:51.535 --> 03:04:53.096]  Oh, your eyes point different directions.
[03:04:54.904 --> 03:04:58.306]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:58.306 --> 03:05:02.289]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:05:02.289 --> 03:05:05.631]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:05.631 --> 03:05:08.153]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:08.153 --> 03:05:12.896]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:05:12.896 --> 03:05:15.237]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:05:15.237 --> 03:05:21.642]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:22.242 --> 03:05:30.452]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:30.452 --> 03:05:35.517]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:35.517 --> 03:05:42.485]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:05:43.126 --> 03:05:48.048]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWarsLife.
[03:05:48.048 --> 03:05:51.070]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:51.730]  It was a beautiful day.
[03:05:51.730 --> 03:05:52.611]  The sun beat down.
[03:06:30.823 --> 03:06:44.039]  We don't mean to be on a Whole Foods Jag now that Bezos has taken over a year and a half ago, but you were talking about a liver cleanse releasing the toxins, a real liver cleanse, you've done ours, what it does to you versus a fake liver cleanse, and then we'll get into the big Russia question I was going to get to.
[03:06:44.039 --> 03:06:44.520]  Go ahead.
[03:06:44.520 --> 03:06:49.786]  Yeah, no, when you do a real liver cleanse using milk thistle and other quality products,
[03:06:50.507 --> 03:06:52.248]  You're going to be angry.
[03:06:52.248 --> 03:06:56.810]  You're going to remember things you were mad about five years ago that you should have just unloaded.
[03:06:56.810 --> 03:06:57.711]  It's a temporary thing.
[03:06:57.711 --> 03:06:58.631]  It's like a cleansing.
[03:06:58.631 --> 03:07:01.152]  You've got to review these things and then it's done.
[03:07:01.152 --> 03:07:02.113]  Here's what I noticed.
[03:07:02.113 --> 03:07:09.357]  I bought a liver cleanse product from Whole Foods six months ago because I'd been on the road, I was eating too much, I was drinking too much.
[03:07:10.177 --> 03:07:11.258]  And I didn't get angry at all.
[03:07:11.258 --> 03:07:13.939]  In fact, I didn't feel anything whatsoever.
[03:07:13.939 --> 03:07:17.801]  Leading me to believe that most of what I was taking was just filler, was nonsense.
[03:07:17.801 --> 03:07:23.684]  You take our, uh, our, uh, uh, uh, Icarin, I guess you'd call it, which I've now done once.
[03:07:23.684 --> 03:07:29.707]  We have Icarin, we also have the liquid, uh... I mean, you will be in a-hole that afternoon, but by nighttime, you'll feel great.
[03:07:29.707 --> 03:07:31.408]  That's how you know it's working.
[03:07:31.408 --> 03:07:35.050]  And your, your urine will be dark brown, because it's actually sucking stuff out.
[03:07:35.290 --> 03:07:37.431]  Yeah, no, look, it's a total cleansing.
[03:07:37.431 --> 03:07:42.873]  But even in Chinese medicine, the liver is the harborer of all negative emotions.
[03:07:42.873 --> 03:08:00.079]  And it just brings up to the surface, psychologically as well as physically... Well, your brain's connected to your gut, and I'm proving that that was actually scientifically based, because when those toxins get brought back out, not through your whole body, but being excreted through the kidneys and liver, a lot of it was held there, which is helping flushing it out of the body.
[03:08:00.079 --> 03:08:02.500]  Your body, just like a bad smell, brings back a memory.
[03:08:03.520 --> 03:08:09.843]  Your brain goes, ooh, I remember when I had that, because it can tell the chemicals subconsciously way more than our conscious mind is.
[03:08:09.843 --> 03:08:11.444]  It remembers all those insults.
[03:08:11.444 --> 03:08:14.946]  It's like, remember the day Roger drank that half bottle of vodka?
[03:08:14.946 --> 03:08:16.347]  Yeah, with Alex on election night.
[03:08:17.649 --> 03:08:19.109]  And the champagne.
[03:08:19.109 --> 03:08:19.870]  Yeah.
[03:08:19.870 --> 03:08:23.251]  Hey, getting serious, I said I would play this clip, so let's go to it.
[03:08:23.251 --> 03:08:33.314]  This is Tucker Carlson, just one of his genius minute and a half deals, where I knew this, I pointed this out, and I've talked about it, but I should make a bigger deal out of it.
[03:08:33.314 --> 03:08:36.715]  CNN pays hundreds of thousands of dollars, and for the TVs.
[03:08:37.515 --> 03:08:46.487]  Hundreds of TVs per major airport to again make you look like they're real news and just like the sun comes out in the morning, it's a big CNN over your head like the Truman Show.
[03:08:46.487 --> 03:08:50.051]  So let's play this clip as that House of Cards continues its downward spiral.
[03:08:50.759 --> 03:08:53.381]  Well, if you've ever been to an American airport, you may have noticed something.
[03:08:53.381 --> 03:08:55.202]  Everyone's watching CNN.
[03:08:55.202 --> 03:08:56.163]  They don't have a choice.
[03:08:56.163 --> 03:09:13.076]  Well, that may have made sense 20 years ago when CNN had a centrist reputation, but these days the channel has strayed so far to the left and is constantly promoting wacky Russia-related conspiracy theories, along with strange spiritual advice from resident philosopher-poet Chris Cuomo, you gotta wonder what's going on.
[03:09:13.436 --> 03:09:19.837]  Airports feel like a lesser version of hell with dirty seats, overpriced food, and propaganda posing as news on CNN.
[03:09:19.837 --> 03:09:24.498]  So why is this network, this channel, in every airport in America?
[03:09:24.498 --> 03:09:28.259]  We decided to find out in a surprisingly large number of cases.
[03:09:28.259 --> 03:09:32.100]  The reason is that CNN is literally paying to have you watch them.
[03:09:32.100 --> 03:09:34.660]  CNN has a special package called CNN Airport.
[03:09:34.660 --> 03:09:37.221]  It combines news, sports, and travel in at least six
[03:09:37.461 --> 03:09:39.863]  60 airports, CNN has signed agreements to show the channel.
[03:09:39.863 --> 03:09:44.708]  In Miami, for example, CNN Airport pays the airport authority a minimum of $150,000 a year.
[03:09:44.708 --> 03:09:55.478]  In Minneapolis, the airport authorities there told us, quote, CNN covers the costs related to the TVs and infrastructure and pays us for the opportunity to be in our facility.
[03:09:55.478 --> 03:09:59.221]  Which raises the question, how much would you have to be paid to watch CNN?
[03:10:00.282 --> 03:10:01.743]  Roger, that's a great question.
[03:10:01.743 --> 03:10:04.564]  How much would you have to be paid to be on CNN?
[03:10:04.564 --> 03:10:05.724]  Well, it's interesting.
[03:10:05.724 --> 03:10:10.826]  When I was in Britain, The Guardian wrote that Stone has been banned on CNN.
[03:10:10.826 --> 03:10:17.809]  In fact, I was banned on both CNN and MSNBC, and I have appeared on both of them since the ban.
[03:10:17.809 --> 03:10:22.631]  So, quite obviously, when you make news, they are forced to cover you.
[03:10:22.631 --> 03:10:27.433]  On the other hand, you couldn't pay me enough to have to associate with Anna Navarro.
[03:10:27.433 --> 03:10:27.513]  Ugh!
[03:10:28.493 --> 03:10:31.078]  And it goes on and on, like we need them.
[03:10:31.078 --> 03:10:35.125]  It's the Streisand effect, trying to suppress you, myself and others.
[03:10:35.125 --> 03:10:38.431]  It only opened this up to even more intellectual audiences.
[03:10:38.431 --> 03:10:41.536]  Let me tell you, they try to ban you, the big thinkers.
[03:10:42.726 --> 03:10:45.787]  If they weren't already paying attention, they really start paying attention.
[03:10:45.787 --> 03:10:48.147]  Yeah, no, there's no question.
[03:10:48.147 --> 03:10:59.410]  As soon as I was banned for life on Twitter, the number of people going to the Stone Cold Truth website, the number of people reading my stuff on the InfoWars site quadrupled almost overnight.
[03:10:59.410 --> 03:11:00.150]  They'll find you.
[03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:01.190]  It's the free market.
[03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.950]  They'll find you.
[03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:04.191]  If you're not at Twitter, they'll go find you someplace else.
[03:11:04.191 --> 03:11:07.652]  Which shows we gave them all the value, like Drudge has always said.
[03:11:09.352 --> 03:11:13.794]  The problem is Google's argued, the Federal Election Commission and others, they want Gab.
[03:11:13.794 --> 03:11:15.295]  It's just libertarian.
[03:11:15.295 --> 03:11:19.257]  They're gay people, communists, conservatives, they're all on there.
[03:11:19.257 --> 03:11:21.178]  They want that banned from Google.
[03:11:22.816 --> 03:11:26.577]  Because it's competition, it's not about liberal or conservative, they're a bunch of jerks!
[03:11:26.577 --> 03:11:30.999]  Look, I have promised a lawsuit on this, and believe me, it's coming.
[03:11:30.999 --> 03:11:35.100]  I was conferring with our friend Milo recently, he's going to join me in this lawsuit.
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:37.461]  But we're not going to hit them where they expect us to come.
[03:11:37.461 --> 03:11:38.661]  We're not stupid.
[03:11:38.661 --> 03:11:42.382]  But this is coming, folks, and it's going to be bloody.
[03:11:42.382 --> 03:11:43.022]  Politically.
[03:11:43.022 --> 03:11:43.483]  Politically.
[03:11:43.483 --> 03:11:47.504]  Alright, let's get to my big question, I'm going to punch you out of here and let you take over.
[03:11:50.350 --> 03:11:53.415]  I know this, and you even said this and others said this.
[03:11:53.415 --> 03:11:55.498]  It doesn't matter if the Russiagate thing isn't true.
[03:11:55.498 --> 03:11:57.501]  Obviously, it's insane.
[03:11:57.501 --> 03:11:58.602]  Are you Martian agents?
[03:11:58.602 --> 03:12:00.686]  Why do you prove a negative?
[03:12:00.686 --> 03:12:01.607]  Do you rape your wife?
[03:12:01.607 --> 03:12:03.650]  Well, she doesn't say I do.
[03:12:03.650 --> 03:12:04.952]  It's just made up crap.
[03:12:04.952 --> 03:12:05.713]  Like, do I have...
[03:12:06.474 --> 03:12:08.377]  PCP in my pants pocket.
[03:12:08.377 --> 03:12:09.498]  Well, no, I don't.
[03:12:09.498 --> 03:12:10.579]  Well, you know, how do you prove you don't?
[03:12:10.579 --> 03:12:11.120]  You'll show us.
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:17.148]  Well, no, I'm not going to get up and show you there's not PCP or how there's not kidnapped kids, you know, in my office.
[03:12:17.148 --> 03:12:21.113]  The point is that I'm flying around with Jerry Epstein and say I'm a pedophile and say I like kids.
[03:12:21.113 --> 03:12:23.756]  Well, then you can accuse me of that because, you know, I'm into it, but I'm not.
[03:12:24.497 --> 03:12:25.798]  The Russia thing.
[03:12:25.798 --> 03:12:26.818]  It's all been disproven.
[03:12:26.818 --> 03:12:27.678]  It goes on and on.
[03:12:27.678 --> 03:12:29.599]  They've been caught in all these crimes.
[03:12:29.599 --> 03:12:37.962]  The system's scared to go after them with all their Russian collusion, all their payoffs to, you know, Orr, to his wife, who got hired for the job, two million dollars, on and on and on.
[03:12:39.395 --> 03:12:46.019]  So, aren't we, by even responding and getting into the whole soap opera, still letting them control the narrative?
[03:12:46.019 --> 03:12:48.381]  Because we're in their narrative, in their world.
[03:12:48.381 --> 03:12:54.524]  I mean, if they came out and all said, we're raping baby dragons, you know, in their pink patooties, you know, every night.
[03:12:54.524 --> 03:12:57.006]  Do we, like, go and have whole shows when they accuse us?
[03:12:57.006 --> 03:13:01.369]  Well, we saw Stone in the Woods with a pink dragon, and we saw Alex with one on top of the house.
[03:13:01.789 --> 03:13:03.069]  Where's the proof?
[03:13:03.069 --> 03:13:05.790]  We're not having sex with pink dragons.
[03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:07.410]  We're not robbing banks.
[03:13:07.410 --> 03:13:08.490]  Roger Stowe keeps robbing banks.
[03:13:08.490 --> 03:13:10.331]  Well, there's no proof of robbing banks.
[03:13:10.331 --> 03:13:12.011]  There's not even banks being robbed.
[03:13:12.011 --> 03:13:23.613]  So the point is, it's like at a certain point we have to disengage and make it where we set the parameter of the globalists are corrupt, Hillary's a fraud, we're going to retake America, we're on the march, lock her up.
[03:13:23.613 --> 03:13:27.474]  We need to get back on the offensive with our own narratives that are reality-based.
[03:13:28.674 --> 03:13:30.094]  Alex, I think that is happening.
[03:13:30.094 --> 03:13:33.675]  What you're looking for is consistency among the voters, and there isn't any.
[03:13:33.675 --> 03:13:38.496]  So the Democrats and the Liberals, first of all, they have no positive message whatsoever.
[03:13:38.496 --> 03:13:39.916]  They've got nothing to sell.
[03:13:39.916 --> 03:13:45.557]  They're not for anything other than the status quo and the continued downward spiral of America.
[03:13:45.557 --> 03:13:55.859]  So, their polls are showing that there's still a majority of Americans, despite all the evidence to the contrary, who believe that the Russians colluded to elect Donald Trump.
[03:13:57.159 --> 03:14:06.922]  The same polls in the next poll, the same polls now show a majority of Americans believe that the Obama administration was illegally spying on Donald Trump.
[03:14:06.922 --> 03:14:08.383]  So we're winning this fight.
[03:14:08.383 --> 03:14:11.804]  They're happening at the same time, but we're winning this fight.
[03:14:11.804 --> 03:14:13.325]  So you have to do two things at once.
[03:14:13.325 --> 03:14:17.026]  You have to push back against their phony narrative, and you need to lay out the facts.
[03:14:17.026 --> 03:14:19.707]  But what we really need, more than anything else,
[03:14:20.507 --> 03:14:23.710]  Is a Justice Department committed to the rule of law?
[03:14:23.710 --> 03:14:25.652]  We're exposing the bad guys!
[03:14:25.652 --> 03:14:31.277]  It's absolutely clear, Uranium One is the largest treasonous crime in American history!
[03:14:31.277 --> 03:14:36.021]  Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, these men should be in prison!
[03:14:36.021 --> 03:14:40.104]  Jeff Sessions, wherever you are, wake the F up!
[03:14:40.104 --> 03:14:40.985]  That's my next question.
[03:14:42.066 --> 03:14:43.587]  What are the big narratives?
[03:14:43.587 --> 03:14:44.628]  Rebuilding jobs?
[03:14:44.628 --> 03:14:46.609]  The family?
[03:14:46.609 --> 03:14:51.492]  I know it's radical, but Valentine's Day is about men and women loving each other and it's okay for men to be men.
[03:14:51.492 --> 03:14:52.353]  Ooh, I'm so radical.
[03:14:52.353 --> 03:14:55.154]  No, they're radical telling us that we shouldn't even say that.
[03:14:55.154 --> 03:14:55.775]  They're the cult.
[03:14:57.730 --> 03:15:00.992]  The good news is that people respond to actual results.
[03:15:00.992 --> 03:15:03.953]  Two million new jobs have been created by this president.
[03:15:03.953 --> 03:15:10.918]  This economy is really beginning to cook, and his tax cuts even haven't had a chance to reach critical mass yet.
[03:15:10.918 --> 03:15:14.140]  That's why they're deliberately raising interest rates, trying to kill it.
[03:15:14.140 --> 03:15:15.641]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[03:15:15.641 --> 03:15:24.687]  If they're successful and spike the economy, when you come back, I know you've got a lot on your plate, but when you come back and you're hosting, if they successfully derail the economy, how do they get away from that narrative?
[03:15:25.327 --> 03:15:38.851]  When we play all the clips of them trying to dynamite us going over the bridge, and they're like, Wile E. Coyote, and they actually blow up the Roadrunner, what happens to Wile E. Coyote is like, this blows up and a rock goes... I mean, what happens?
[03:15:38.851 --> 03:15:41.371]  We'll get to it on the other side.
[03:15:41.371 --> 03:15:42.732]  They're on the wrong side of history.
[03:15:42.732 --> 03:15:43.792]  They're losing.
[03:15:43.792 --> 03:15:45.592]  That's why they're so nasty.
[03:15:45.592 --> 03:15:46.233]  That's right.
[03:15:46.233 --> 03:15:47.413]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:47.413 --> 03:15:48.793]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:48.793 --> 03:15:51.294]  They extinguished themselves with their own political evil.
[03:15:53.837 --> 03:15:58.959]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:58.959 --> 03:16:04.661]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:16:04.661 --> 03:16:09.863]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:16:09.863 --> 03:16:11.804]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:16:11.804 --> 03:16:14.185]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:16:14.185 --> 03:16:15.145]  See guidelines.
[03:16:15.145 --> 03:16:18.426]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:16:18.426 --> 03:16:20.367]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:16:20.367 --> 03:16:21.928]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:16:23.672 --> 03:16:25.573]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[03:16:25.573 --> 03:16:28.795]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[03:16:28.795 --> 03:16:30.396]  Savory and delicious.
[03:16:30.396 --> 03:16:33.238]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:33.238 --> 03:16:33.898]  Awesome.

[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:38.541]  NASA PAC Technology.

[03:16:43.324 --> 03:16:44.765]  Or warm and served.

[03:16:53.925 --> 03:16:55.887]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:16:55.887 --> 03:17:01.211]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:17:01.211 --> 03:17:02.793]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:17:02.793 --> 03:17:11.160]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:17:25.516 --> 03:17:27.699]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[03:17:59.923 --> 03:18:05.646]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[03:18:05.646 --> 03:18:08.608]  Now the product is bodies, whole body support.

[03:18:36.658 --> 03:18:38.939]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.

[03:18:47.288 --> 03:18:53.372]  The ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:18:58.316 --> 03:19:09.824]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[03:19:09.824 --> 03:19:10.725]  This is Pollen Block.
[03:19:11.725 --> 03:19:24.393]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:24.393 --> 03:19:28.715]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[03:19:28.715 --> 03:19:32.718]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[03:19:33.178 --> 03:19:43.266]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:19:43.266 --> 03:19:46.408]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[03:19:50.511 --> 03:19:52.272]  888-253-3139 You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.200 --> 03:20:21.162]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live with Roger Stone.
[03:20:21.162 --> 03:20:24.765]  I was going to be pulling out here and having him take over, and he will be taking over.
[03:20:24.765 --> 03:20:29.369]  But through this hour, the end of the Alex Jones Show, into the next, with the War Room, I'll be hosting.
[03:20:29.369 --> 03:20:32.351]  Roger will be here, of course, and Owen Schroyer.
[03:20:32.351 --> 03:20:35.013]  We had an NSA shooting with three people shot earlier today.
[03:20:35.013 --> 03:20:35.834]  We were watching that.
[03:20:35.834 --> 03:20:37.835]  They said it didn't look like it was terror-related.
[03:20:37.835 --> 03:20:39.476]  We'll have more of that in a minute.
[03:20:39.476 --> 03:20:42.038]  It does not appear to be terrorism, but what remains a mystery.
[03:20:42.939 --> 03:20:47.990]  But I saw this about 30 minutes ago and it said several shot and I hoped it was just drug related or something.
[03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:50.856]  I hope nobody was hurt but report of active shooter at
[03:20:53.587 --> 03:20:56.549]  Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Miami.
[03:20:56.549 --> 03:21:03.914]  Authorities are investigating an incident and they're saying that says 20 to 50 people might be injured.
[03:21:03.914 --> 03:21:04.154]  U.S.
[03:21:04.154 --> 03:21:09.798]  Coast Guard and Palm Beach County are sending helicopters to help.
[03:21:09.798 --> 03:21:14.922]  A number of people could be seen loaded into ambulances on a stretcher.
[03:21:14.922 --> 03:21:17.464]  Let's roll a few minutes of Fox News coverage of this right now.
[03:21:18.531 --> 03:21:25.875]  It was a normal fire drill, I guess.
[03:21:25.875 --> 03:21:28.977]  Normally, we keep one every month.
[03:21:28.977 --> 03:21:30.417]  And we were just assuming it's that one.
[03:21:30.417 --> 03:21:32.398]  But then, the second drill went off in my pod.
[03:21:32.398 --> 03:21:34.159]  We just all assumed that it was a normal drill.
[03:21:34.159 --> 03:21:37.341]  But as we're walking out, we start hearing, like, pop shots.
[03:21:37.341 --> 03:21:39.562]  And no one seemed to be worried about it.
[03:21:39.562 --> 03:21:41.863]  People thought that it was just another, like, intense drill.
[03:21:41.863 --> 03:21:45.125]  They told us about a drill before where they were going to be shooting blanks.
[03:21:46.067 --> 03:21:51.032]  So we heard the shots, like, hey, it's just that joke.
[03:21:51.032 --> 03:21:53.695]  How did you get out of the school safely?
[03:21:53.695 --> 03:21:57.199]  We took the back route across.
[03:21:57.199 --> 03:22:00.402]  They're saying 20 to 50 people may have been injured.
[03:22:00.402 --> 03:22:02.865]  I mean, these are victim disarmament zones.
[03:22:02.865 --> 03:22:07.289]  It's like the media advertises, this is where you go where no one's harmed to shoot you.
[03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:11.914]  And then it's almost always some crazed leftist or weird Islamist that's done it.
[03:22:11.914 --> 03:22:16.779]  And the left keeps saying, if you expose us on the memo, there'll be big massacres blamed on you.
[03:22:16.779 --> 03:22:18.601]  They're basically blaming Oklahoma City.
[03:22:18.601 --> 03:22:24.047]  It's too early to tell, but they covered up the Islamic connections to Vegas and other events.
[03:22:24.047 --> 03:22:27.550]  Roger, I mean, just first looks at this, you're from Florida right now.
[03:22:27.550 --> 03:22:27.991]  You live there.
[03:22:28.191 --> 03:22:29.612]  This is my home county.
[03:22:29.612 --> 03:22:32.293]  I actually have relatives who live in Parkland.
[03:22:32.293 --> 03:22:39.037]  I just got a text from my wife that fortunately nobody we know, no one in our family is involved in this incident.
[03:22:39.037 --> 03:22:47.982]  The Broward County Sheriff's Office, an incredibly able group of people, crimes down in every category in my home county under the BSO.
[03:22:47.982 --> 03:22:49.122]  They are on the scenes.
[03:22:49.122 --> 03:22:53.445]  We're waiting for more information, but this will be hyped tomorrow.
[03:22:54.545 --> 03:23:04.293]  Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer and Anna Navarro will be using this yet again as an excuse to take away our firearms.
[03:23:04.293 --> 03:23:08.036]  It's a shame that the left constantly seeks to benefit from tragedy.
[03:23:08.664 --> 03:23:15.750]  And if there is any Islamic connection, you can bet your bottom dollar that there'll be no coverage of it, just like San Bernardino.
[03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:19.633]  Fort Hood, they said for, what, five years it was not an Islamic attack.
[03:23:19.633 --> 03:23:21.594]  He pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda.
[03:23:21.594 --> 03:23:22.055]  He did it.
[03:23:22.055 --> 03:23:25.758]  He shot 14 people, killed 14 people, shot more than that.
[03:23:25.758 --> 03:23:31.742]  So Stoneman Douglas High School, right now we're watching all of this unfold.
[03:23:31.742 --> 03:23:34.665]  And they're saying it could still be an active shooter, but I don't think they know right now.
[03:23:39.998 --> 03:23:41.880]  Alex, we're praying for the families.
[03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:48.005]  I mean, this has got to be a horrific thing to send your kids to school and then turn on the TV and see this kind of thing.
[03:23:48.005 --> 03:23:50.607]  But mark my words, you're absolutely right.
[03:23:50.607 --> 03:23:53.909]  If there's an Islamic connection, we won't ever learn about it.
[03:23:53.909 --> 03:23:55.491]  They'll just cover it up.
[03:23:55.491 --> 03:24:00.134]  And they'll be using this tomorrow to beat the drums to end our Second Amendment rights.
[03:24:00.134 --> 03:24:02.196]  There we have the images of children being marched out.
[03:24:02.196 --> 03:24:03.477]  I'll put that on screen.
[03:24:03.477 --> 03:24:05.339]  Children being marched out with their hands up.
[03:24:05.979 --> 03:24:13.181]  Showing that the police still don't know then, we can just punch that up if you'd like, we still don't know who supposedly did this.
[03:24:14.327 --> 03:24:18.070]  So let's go back to more of this coverage.
[03:24:18.070 --> 03:24:23.394]  I'm about less than a half a mile from the actual school, but let me just show you how much police presence is here.
[03:24:23.394 --> 03:24:26.796]  If we can go back here, Scott, I'm showing them how much police presence.
[03:24:26.796 --> 03:24:33.101]  We've got Fort Lauderdale, Coral Springs, Broward Sheriff's deputies in the corner over there.
[03:24:33.101 --> 03:24:39.526]  We've got parents, you can see parents arriving here trying to figure out exactly where their child is.
[03:24:39.946 --> 03:24:43.048]  But deputies and police officers have been arriving.
[03:24:43.048 --> 03:24:52.252]  We just saw the command post, the SWAT team command post just drive through here and set up a spot closer to the school.
[03:24:52.252 --> 03:24:59.156]  So we are on exactly Coral Ridge Drive here and Holmberg is across the street.
[03:24:59.156 --> 03:25:03.518]  You know, ever since Columbine, I don't like the mindset of waiting to see who the shooter is.
[03:25:04.138 --> 03:25:08.723]  You know, waiting outside, and then going in, and then have everybody march out with their hands up.
[03:25:08.723 --> 03:25:11.626]  You know, in the old days, as long as they had a tower shooter, you'd just storm in there and kill them.
[03:25:12.816 --> 03:25:15.437]  And we still don't know what happened in Las Vegas.
[03:25:15.437 --> 03:25:24.943]  I mean, it's only, frankly, through the incredible investigative reporting of Laura Loomer that we found out about all these discrepancies in the coroner's report.
[03:25:24.943 --> 03:25:26.724]  Oh, the shooter was 6'4".
[03:25:26.724 --> 03:25:27.904]  Oh, no, he wasn't.
[03:25:27.904 --> 03:25:28.405]  He was 6'3".
[03:25:28.405 --> 03:25:32.147]  Now, there's multiple shooters and there's women in the hotel we first broke in.
[03:25:32.147 --> 03:25:38.290]  And we told the hostage rescue team that he had ISIS connections, which have now come out.
[03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:42.032]  And the room service bill showed that two people were dining in the room.
[03:25:42.032 --> 03:25:43.633]  So who's the second person?
[03:25:43.633 --> 03:25:49.957]  Again, I know it's a prostitute who said that he said that he was under MKUltra mind control.
[03:25:49.957 --> 03:25:52.519]  You notice they now say they don't know what happened.
[03:25:52.519 --> 03:25:57.722]  We were all conspiracy theorists for questioning it, for talking about it, for going over it.
[03:25:57.722 --> 03:26:01.705]  But now, now Roger, it's all out in the open.
[03:26:01.705 --> 03:26:05.247]  We're not conspiracy theorists, we're conspiracy realists.
[03:26:05.247 --> 03:26:06.828]  We go where the facts lead us, that's all.
[03:26:08.012 --> 03:26:12.536]  Let's go back to Fox 7 in Miami and hear more of what witnesses are saying right now.
[03:26:12.536 --> 03:26:15.439]  A girl from his class was shot.
[03:26:15.439 --> 03:26:17.781]  And where were you when this all happened?
[03:26:17.781 --> 03:26:19.122]  In my classroom.
[03:26:19.122 --> 03:26:22.185]  I was really nearby the exit.
[03:26:22.185 --> 03:26:25.147]  And you're hearing this happen in the freshman building is what we're hearing.
[03:26:25.147 --> 03:26:25.368]  Yeah.
[03:26:26.088 --> 03:26:27.929]  And what are your friends saying?
[03:26:27.929 --> 03:26:30.290]  Are they still inside of the school?
[03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:33.352]  No, all my friends were able to evacuate.
[03:26:33.352 --> 03:26:35.933]  Now, as a parent, this has got to be the most frightening thing.
[03:26:35.933 --> 03:26:36.634]  Oh, it's very frightening.
[03:26:36.634 --> 03:26:44.017]  I was coming here to pick her up and I still have my son that is on West Plain Middle School.
[03:26:44.017 --> 03:26:44.798]  Is he still there?
[03:26:45.478 --> 03:26:57.533]  Yeah, I tried to call him and then the teacher got the phone and then he said everything's okay but they're still locked up for, you know, until they feel that it's safe to go out.
[03:26:57.533 --> 03:27:01.518]  So I still have a son over there on the middle school.
[03:27:02.159 --> 03:27:04.821]  As a parent, as a father, it's hit hard.
[03:27:04.821 --> 03:27:06.543]  No, you never think that it's going to happen to you.
[03:27:06.543 --> 03:27:14.070]  You know, the things that you see on the movies and all of a sudden you see on the middle of everything and then it's very, it's very sad.
[03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:18.534]  It's very sad because, you know, you still don't know what's going on inside there.
[03:27:18.534 --> 03:27:23.158]  And I'm happy because my daughter is here, my son is okay, but I'm very, you know, upset.
[03:27:23.158 --> 03:27:24.379]  Sad for what?
[03:27:24.379 --> 03:27:26.321]  For this, for that, for the parents.
[03:27:27.659 --> 03:27:30.041]  All right, we're going to continue to have live coverage of this tragedy.
[03:27:30.041 --> 03:27:31.182]  Pray for those that have been shot.
[03:27:31.182 --> 03:27:33.904]  We're saying 20 to 50 have been shot.
[03:27:33.904 --> 03:27:35.465]  So it shows they don't really know what's going on.
[03:27:35.465 --> 03:27:37.847]  Hopefully it's not a number of anybody that's been killed.
[03:27:37.847 --> 03:27:43.051]  But we'll follow that here at InfoWars for the next 30 minutes with Roger covering all the news.
[03:27:43.051 --> 03:27:47.674]  He's got lined up into the war room with Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone coming up.
[03:27:47.674 --> 03:27:50.156]  So again, we'll continue to analyze this in real time.
[03:27:50.156 --> 03:27:54.239]  But I've got to tell you, the Democrats have been caught in false flags before.
[03:27:55.444 --> 03:28:02.650]  I'm not saying this is a false flag, but they've been talking about massacres and things, and people don't leave them alone, and it will release the memo.
[03:28:02.650 --> 03:28:15.482]  So, if there are massacres, and they keep threatening massacres, that makes them suspects when they've been threatening massacres, and who knows what mentally ill person they've wound up, or what's happening, or is this gang-related.
[03:28:15.482 --> 03:28:16.183]  We don't know.
[03:28:16.183 --> 03:28:19.065]  The media will say that I said it's a false flag and the Democrats did it.
[03:28:19.065 --> 03:28:19.646]  I did not say that.
[03:28:20.725 --> 03:28:24.226]  We're simply questioning the long history that these folks have.
[03:28:24.226 --> 03:28:33.969]  Roger Stone takes over for the next two segments and then he'll move to the other studio and be hosting with Owen Schroyer with The War Room that kicks off 3 to 6 Central.
[03:28:33.969 --> 03:28:35.189]  This is InfoWars Live.
[03:28:35.189 --> 03:28:42.072]  Here's truly Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and of course PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:28:42.072 --> 03:28:45.673]  A ton of news we didn't cover today, but we covered a you-know-what ton.
[03:28:45.673 --> 03:28:47.733]  So, more up straight ahead.
[03:28:47.733 --> 03:28:49.554]  Pray for those right now at the
[03:28:50.334 --> 03:28:52.855]  School, public school in Miami, Florida.
[03:28:52.855 --> 03:28:53.835]  Stay with us.
[03:28:53.835 --> 03:28:54.735]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:54.735 --> 03:28:57.136]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:57.136 --> 03:29:05.258]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[03:29:05.258 --> 03:29:07.079]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:29:07.199 --> 03:29:10.901]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[03:29:10.901 --> 03:29:15.644]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.

[03:29:23.715 --> 03:29:28.837]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:29:28.837 --> 03:29:34.538]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:29:34.538 --> 03:29:39.740]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:41.681]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:29:41.681 --> 03:29:44.081]  Holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing.
[03:29:44.081 --> 03:29:45.022]  See guidelines.
[03:29:45.022 --> 03:29:48.303]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:29:48.303 --> 03:29:50.243]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:29:50.243 --> 03:29:51.804]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[03:29:58.015 --> 03:30:02.699]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:30:02.699 --> 03:30:05.261]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[03:30:05.261 --> 03:30:10.346]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:30:10.346 --> 03:30:12.248]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[03:30:12.248 --> 03:30:14.029]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:30:14.029 --> 03:30:19.314]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:30:19.314 --> 03:30:20.915]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[03:30:21.636 --> 03:30:27.263]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:30:27.263 --> 03:30:29.105]  Secret 12.
[03:30:29.105 --> 03:30:30.266]  Optimal absorption.
[03:30:30.266 --> 03:30:35.412]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:30:35.412 --> 03:30:40.598]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:30:40.598 --> 03:30:41.319]  Optimum levels.
[03:30:42.820 --> 03:30:49.543]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:14.181]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:31:14.181 --> 03:31:16.304]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:31:16.304 --> 03:31:20.308]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:20.308 --> 03:31:21.330]  And I want to thank everybody that has.

[03:31:32.577 --> 03:31:35.359]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[03:31:54.191 --> 03:31:57.613]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:31:57.613 --> 03:32:01.574]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:32:01.574 --> 03:32:04.916]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:32:04.916 --> 03:32:07.437]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:32:07.437 --> 03:32:11.799]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:32:12.159 --> 03:32:21.544]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:21.544 --> 03:32:28.708]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:29.708 --> 03:32:34.770]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:32:34.770 --> 03:32:42.412]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:32:42.412 --> 03:32:47.333]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[03:32:47.333 --> 03:32:50.254]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:32:57.415 --> 03:33:09.567]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.567 --> 03:33:13.931]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:13.931 --> 03:33:18.435]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:18.435 --> 03:33:21.698]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:24.164 --> 03:33:25.725]  Welcome back.
[03:33:25.725 --> 03:33:31.710]  You're on the Alex Jones Show here at Freedom Command Central.
[03:33:31.710 --> 03:33:40.958]  And we're going to break down for you the internal struggle over who will be President Donald Trump's next Chief of Staff.
[03:33:40.958 --> 03:33:50.706]  Now, you may remember when Reince Priebus, the former Republican National Chairman, was Donald Trump's Chief of Staff, general chaos ensued.
[03:33:51.466 --> 03:34:03.631]  Anybody could stroll into the Oval Office without an appointment, without being on the presidential schedule, and just inadvertently drop paper for which there was no tracking system.
[03:34:03.631 --> 03:34:12.194]  Chaos ensued, and it was a process like this that gave you, for example, Rod Rosenstein as the Deputy Attorney General.
[03:34:12.194 --> 03:34:15.516]  Rosenstein was promoted for that job by Priebus.
[03:34:15.516 --> 03:34:20.338]  There was clearly no vetting to show that Rosenstein was a rat.
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:23.002]  That's why we're stuck with him.
[03:34:23.002 --> 03:34:28.628]  Then General John Kelly came in, pushed by Steve Bannon.
[03:34:28.628 --> 03:34:41.020]  The first thing that Kelly did was to purge Anthony Scaramucci, who enjoyed a warm personal relationship with the president and wasn't afraid to go out and take the president's critics on in public.
[03:34:41.761 --> 03:34:47.224]  Then, ironically, the next person that Kelly purged was his patron, Steve Bannon.
[03:34:47.224 --> 03:34:54.228]  The man who got Kelly to DHS and then got him into the White House Chief of Staff job.
[03:34:54.228 --> 03:34:56.550]  Bannon was gone.
[03:34:56.550 --> 03:35:08.977]  Now, it is abundantly clear that General Kelly knew about credible claims of spousal abuse by White House Cabinet Secretary Rob Porter.
[03:35:10.736 --> 03:35:22.000]  We know that the FBI gave their background report, which is required for security clearance, to the Chief of Staff, Priebus, in June.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:26.082]  That Priebus passed the information on to his successor in July.
[03:35:26.082 --> 03:35:32.484]  And very clearly, Kelly knew about these allegations, but promoted Porter anyway.
[03:35:32.484 --> 03:35:32.844]  Why?
[03:35:32.844 --> 03:35:33.785]  It's very simple.
[03:35:34.605 --> 03:35:46.174]  You see, Mr. Porter was Mr. Kelly's, General Kelly's, candidate for Chief of Staff after Kelly moves on to be the Secretary of Defense.
[03:35:46.174 --> 03:36:02.486]  Yes, it is widely thought inside the Trump circle that General Pettis, currently the first military non-civilian Secretary of Defense in recent memory, will not fill out the entire term and General Kelly aspires to that job.
[03:36:03.326 --> 03:36:12.429]  I can tell you, as a long-time veteran of Trump world, that you can't leave the job you're in now unless you have a candidate to replace you.
[03:36:12.429 --> 03:36:24.374]  And Mr. Porter, a Bush Republican whose father, Roger Porter, is among the president's most vicious critics, a veteran anti-Trumper, was in line for the job.
[03:36:25.314 --> 03:36:26.915]  Until now.
[03:36:26.915 --> 03:36:31.458]  General Kelly is, to use a colloquial term, toast.
[03:36:31.458 --> 03:36:32.598]  And he knows it.
[03:36:32.598 --> 03:36:35.800]  And he's begun telling intimates that he's leaving.
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:42.824]  Meanwhile, a search goes on to find somebody who will take this soul-crushing job.
[03:36:42.824 --> 03:36:45.885]  This is an all-consuming job.
[03:36:45.885 --> 03:36:49.107]  And yes, Donald Trump is a tough taskmaster.
[03:36:49.107 --> 03:36:51.609]  He wants the best, and he wants it now.
[03:36:52.429 --> 03:37:18.717]  Now, as I reported on the show earlier, we know that he felt out his best friend Tom Barrack, the chairman of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate opportunity fund, about taking this job, but that Barrack, who would have been excellent in terms of his managerial skills and his shrewd political judgments and his loyalty to Donald Trump personally, declined this high honor.
[03:37:19.477 --> 03:37:30.304]  Now, the president also has felt out his current cabinet officer, Mick Mulvaney, who is getting high marks inside the administration.
[03:37:30.304 --> 03:37:36.448]  But Mulvaney aspires to go back to his native Oklahoma to run for governor.
[03:37:36.448 --> 03:37:38.069]  And that leaves him out.
[03:37:38.989 --> 03:37:46.673]  Sean Hannity has advocated the appointment of one of the great Washington wise men, Wayne Berman.
[03:37:46.673 --> 03:38:06.784]  Now, although Berman has a long history of raising money for establishment Republican candidates like John McCain and George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, Berman was a longtime lobbyist and advisor to Donald Trump, someone the president knows, likes and trusts.
[03:38:07.324 --> 03:38:12.508]  Berman is also among the most capable and discreet individuals in Washington.
[03:38:12.508 --> 03:38:14.869]  This is Sean Hannity's candidate.
[03:38:14.869 --> 03:38:19.012]  Whether Berman is under consideration, we don't know.
[03:38:19.012 --> 03:38:23.316]  Also reportedly in the running is David Urban.
[03:38:23.996 --> 03:38:34.962]  David Urban is a former choir boy, Catholic, NRA member, whose father was an iron worker from Western Pennsylvania.
[03:38:34.962 --> 03:38:39.005]  He is a veteran of some distinction.
[03:38:39.005 --> 03:38:46.149]  But more importantly, he ran a terrific campaign on the ground in Pennsylvania, a crucial state for Donald Trump.
[03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:57.300]  Early on, Urban desired to be Republican National Chairman, a job for which he was passed over, and now reportedly in line to be Ambassador of Saudi Arabia.
[03:38:57.300 --> 03:39:05.568]  Urban would also be an excellent and most capable choice, a man capable of enormous discretion, but super organized.
[03:39:05.568 --> 03:39:08.952]  And then there's the one candidate that disturbs me the most.
[03:39:09.702 --> 03:39:13.565]  That would be Goldman Sachs alum, Gary Cohn.
[03:39:13.565 --> 03:39:22.932]  Now, Mr. Cohn, you may recall, was the Trump advisor who wanted the President to sign the Paris Climate Accords.
[03:39:22.932 --> 03:39:38.224]  He incredibly gave an interview to the New York Post that said that the President was flying to Europe to, quote, get smart, and that his views on the matter of global warming were, quote, evolving, close quote.
[03:39:39.485 --> 03:39:44.826]  At that time, Mr. Cohn aspired to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[03:39:44.826 --> 03:39:49.348]  That isn't going to happen in the wake of his performance.
[03:39:49.348 --> 03:40:00.230]  He is a great advocate of carbon credits, carbon tax credits, another lousy liberal idea that would benefit Goldman Sachs, but not the American people.
[03:40:00.230 --> 03:40:02.791]  He was unable to sell the president on that either.
[03:40:03.451 --> 03:40:08.333]  You can clearly see his fingerprints over the president's new infrastructure plan.
[03:40:08.333 --> 03:40:12.874]  It was written for, by, and with Goldman Sachs.
[03:40:12.874 --> 03:40:16.715]  The good news is that it's not going to pass in its current form.
[03:40:16.715 --> 03:40:18.736]  The president's instincts are exactly right.
[03:40:18.736 --> 03:40:24.478]  We need to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our airports, our infrastructure.
[03:40:24.998 --> 03:40:26.900]  But we need better tools to do it.
[03:40:26.900 --> 03:40:38.211]  This plan, the Goldman Sachs plan, the Gary Cohn plan, is designed to allow Goldman Sachs to sell more municipal bonds and little else.
[03:40:38.211 --> 03:40:45.338]  So there you have it, an inside the beltway breakdown on those who might be the president's next chief of staff.
[03:40:46.199 --> 03:40:51.523]  Reportedly, the President's son-in-law and his daughter are pushing Gary Cohn.
[03:40:51.523 --> 03:40:57.887]  How a liberal Democrat from Goldman Sachs got inside the building to begin with is hard to say.
[03:40:57.887 --> 03:41:06.053]  I want to remind you that everything we do here at InfoWars is listener and viewer sponsored through the InfoWars.com store.
[03:41:07.053 --> 03:41:13.676]  These are the very best all-natural products that you can get, and the prices today are slashed.

[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:25.561]  A stunning 25% off.
[03:41:25.561 --> 03:41:28.763]  Mental clarity, mental energy.
[03:41:28.763 --> 03:41:34.045]  When you get to that dip in the afternoon, you think you're done for the day, and you just don't know how you're gonna

[03:41:42.968 --> 03:41:45.609]  It's very subtle, and you're not amped up.

[03:41:59.253 --> 03:42:03.435]  You helped pay for the extraordinary expansion we've got going on here at InfoWars.
[03:42:03.435 --> 03:42:07.177]  I saw and toured the new state-of-the-art studio.
[03:42:07.177 --> 03:42:09.698]  This is going to rock.
[03:42:09.698 --> 03:42:18.563]  And when you combine it with these incredibly expensive but very effective satellites that Alex Jones is bringing online, well, we're expanding the truth.
[03:42:18.563 --> 03:42:20.564]  We're expanding the First Amendment.
[03:42:20.564 --> 03:42:21.064]  So, folks,
[03:42:21.704 --> 03:42:24.988]  It's a 360 win, as Alex Jones would say.
[03:42:24.988 --> 03:42:26.069]  Help yourself.
[03:42:26.069 --> 03:42:27.030]  Help us.
[03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:31.235]  We are the tip of the spear, but we only win if you go to the store.

[03:42:40.105 --> 03:42:41.246]  Many thanks.
[03:42:41.246 --> 03:42:41.987]  I'll be right back.
[03:42:53.962 --> 03:42:58.904]  I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:42:58.904 --> 03:43:04.625]  And this is basically a product that I've been taking anyway before we even launched our own version of it.
[03:43:04.625 --> 03:43:07.586]  Now the product is bodies, whole body support.
[03:43:07.586 --> 03:43:12.888]  This is available right now at a massive 50% discount at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:12.888 --> 03:43:16.569]  It's the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market.

[03:43:25.846 --> 03:43:33.591]  Now, we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically proven to have.
[03:43:33.591 --> 03:43:35.632]  So, I just got this fresh today.
[03:43:35.632 --> 03:43:37.933]  Literally, the seal's not even being opened on it.
[03:43:37.933 --> 03:43:39.294]  It's just $29.95.
[03:43:39.294 --> 03:43:41.716]  Again, big, big, chunky bottle.
[03:43:41.716 --> 03:43:44.597]  120 capsules in this bottle.
[03:43:44.597 --> 03:43:45.238]  It is bodies.
[03:43:46.258 --> 03:43:52.360]  The ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:53.680]  Get it today.
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:58.482]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:43:58.482 --> 03:44:02.263]  But instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:44:02.263 --> 03:44:06.805]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:44:06.805 --> 03:44:09.946]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:44:09.946 --> 03:44:13.067]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:44:14.574 --> 03:44:27.399]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:44:27.399 --> 03:44:42.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[03:44:58.095 --> 03:45:09.602]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[03:45:09.602 --> 03:45:10.523]  This is pollen block.
[03:45:11.503 --> 03:45:24.169]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:24.169 --> 03:45:28.491]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[03:45:28.491 --> 03:45:32.493]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[03:45:32.953 --> 03:45:43.060]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:46.182]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[03:46:58.336 --> 03:47:00.957]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.548 --> 03:47:23.680]  This is Bernie Sanders, and I know a lot of my supporters may not believe this, but I listen to Roger Stone whenever he's on InfoWars.
[03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:30.106]  It's a great program, at least in my opinion.
[03:47:30.106 --> 03:47:31.387]  Welcome back.
[03:47:37.848 --> 03:47:43.509]  I'm Roger Stone, and yes, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:43.509 --> 03:48:03.473]  Well, it seems like Attorney General Jeff Sessions is attacking Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado because Gardner is holding up the judicial appointments of the administration because he objects to the fact that Jeff Sessions seeks to
[03:48:04.833 --> 03:48:15.640]  Crack down on state legalized marijuana in complete opposite of the president's stated position in the presidential campaign.
[03:48:16.863 --> 03:48:21.225]  Make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is not a fan of marijuana.
[03:48:21.225 --> 03:48:31.390]  On the other hand, he very clearly said, time and time again, that he realizes that millions of Americans are using it for medicinal purposes.
[03:48:31.390 --> 03:48:39.775]  He realizes that it is greatly superior to opioids, and he believes the people should decide, the states should decide.
[03:48:40.975 --> 03:48:46.299]  29 states have legalized some form of legal marijuana.
[03:48:46.299 --> 03:48:52.662]  Only 9 states have legalized so-called recreational marijuana.
[03:48:52.662 --> 03:48:57.045]  Now people say to me, well Stone, what are you, some kind of pothead?
[03:48:57.045 --> 03:48:57.926]  Let me be pretty clear.
[03:48:58.926 --> 03:49:02.989]  My grandfather and my father both died of cancer.
[03:49:02.989 --> 03:49:07.992]  They both had to go through both radiation and chemotherapy.
[03:49:07.992 --> 03:49:10.853]  I saw them waste away to nothing.
[03:49:10.853 --> 03:49:14.435]  I saw the horrific pain they were trying to deal with.
[03:49:14.435 --> 03:49:16.377]  And I saw how the opioids
[03:49:17.497 --> 03:49:29.044]  That the doctors gave them, in the case of my grandfather, an early generation of it, robbed them of any quality of life in their twilight years.
[03:49:29.044 --> 03:49:38.810]  And then one of my cousins, who is active on Instagram, recommended to me, well, why don't you get your grandfather some marijuana?
[03:49:38.810 --> 03:49:39.411]  Which I did.
[03:49:40.211 --> 03:49:42.213]  And I saw his appetite return.
[03:49:42.213 --> 03:49:44.074]  I saw him put on weight.
[03:49:44.074 --> 03:49:53.683]  And it seemed to me that he was able to manage his exit from this world, his departure from this mortal coil, with some dignity.
[03:49:53.683 --> 03:49:57.066]  That's why I think this is an important fight.
[03:49:57.066 --> 03:50:03.571]  I don't know what's wrong with Jeff Sessions, but the president said he's for medicinal marijuana.
[03:50:03.571 --> 03:50:07.595]  He told me this personally in a telephone call several months ago.
[03:50:08.275 --> 03:50:13.401]  And this policy is completely inconsistent with what the president says he's for.
[03:50:14.560 --> 03:50:18.701]  It will also politically be a disaster.
[03:50:18.701 --> 03:50:25.663]  In key swing states, many of them have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes.
[03:50:25.663 --> 03:50:41.767]  I think many libertarian voters voted for Donald Trump because they were reassured by his position that he would protect the access of millions of Americans who have come to rely on cannabis for medicine.
[03:50:42.347 --> 03:50:46.210]  No, it's Jeff Sessions who's out of step.
[03:50:46.210 --> 03:50:58.081]  And kudos for a great senator, Cory Gardner, standing up for principle, standing up for President Donald Trump's position on cannabis.
[03:50:59.864 --> 03:51:22.490]  We also have exciting news, because I have long thought that former CIA Director John Brennan is the chief strategist, the quarterback, the diabolical evil genius behind the entire phony Russian collusion narrative.
[03:51:23.530 --> 03:51:26.234]  I figured this out back during the campaign.
[03:51:26.234 --> 03:51:40.013]  It was October when I saw a New York Post story in which Brennan was predicting that the Russians would attempt to interfere with the election and help to assist in the election of Donald Trump.
[03:51:41.274 --> 03:51:46.238]  Mr. Brennan spoke a little too soon and he exposed himself.
[03:51:46.238 --> 03:52:02.689]  Now, courageous House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is focused like a laser beam on the question of whether Mr. Brennan has lied under oath about his knowledge of the so-called dirty dossier.
[03:52:02.689 --> 03:52:10.214]  This is the dossier created first at the behest of a Republican hedge fund manager who was
[03:52:10.854 --> 03:52:12.655]  Supporting Marco Rubio.
[03:52:12.655 --> 03:52:21.740]  But then this hot potato, this turd, got passed on to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.
[03:52:21.740 --> 03:52:28.083]  And then ultimately was passed on to the FBI by none other than John McCain.
[03:52:28.823 --> 03:52:33.845]  By the way, Senator, did you know it was a fabrication when you passed it on?
[03:52:33.845 --> 03:52:45.568]  And it has been the centerpiece, as we know, the rationale that they used legally to get warrants on Donald Trump and his associates.
[03:52:45.568 --> 03:52:48.029]  Now, it seems odd that
[03:52:49.108 --> 03:53:08.556]  Adam Schiff, you know, Schiff for brains, and his sidekick, Eric, pretty boy Swalwell, keep insisting that there was additional information that warranted these warrants and the surveillance of the Republican candidate for president.
[03:53:08.556 --> 03:53:10.497]  I'd like to see their memo.
[03:53:10.497 --> 03:53:13.639]  I'm anxious to see their counter-memo.
[03:53:13.639 --> 03:53:16.400]  Pretty clear to me that they loaded it up
[03:53:17.088 --> 03:53:40.982]  With sensitive and classified information in an extraordinary game of chicken, where they don't want us to know the facts, so they put some classified information in there, trying to goad the president into blocking it, so they can say, ah, you see, we're hiding this.
[03:53:42.327 --> 03:53:43.731]  Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53:43.731 --> 03:53:44.432]  I apologize.
[03:53:44.432 --> 03:53:46.097]  I've just got to take a little run here.
[03:53:46.097 --> 03:53:47.279]  So I was getting my wallet keys.
[03:53:47.279 --> 03:53:47.841]  I forgot those.
[03:53:48.664 --> 03:53:49.865]  All right.
[03:53:49.865 --> 03:53:51.066]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[03:53:51.066 --> 03:53:56.531]  Now, this is an extended game of chicken that's going on.
[03:53:56.531 --> 03:54:10.543]  I want them to release the Democrats' phony memo, because members of Congress that I know, who have seen it, tell me it is ridiculous, that it's tortured.
[03:54:10.543 --> 03:54:16.307]  And more important, it doesn't produce any additional information that proves Russian collusion.
[03:54:17.168 --> 03:54:23.055]  Incredibly, I watched Eric Swalwell the day before yesterday with Tucker Carlson.
[03:54:23.055 --> 03:54:25.398]  And when Tucker kept saying, where's your evidence?
[03:54:25.398 --> 03:54:28.682]  You've had a year and a half of this and you've produced nothing.
[03:54:28.682 --> 03:54:33.588]  And Swalwell said, well, if they just let us question witnesses.
[03:54:34.756 --> 03:54:38.277]  I was in front of the committee for four hours straight.
[03:54:38.277 --> 03:54:41.377]  I answered every question they had.
[03:54:41.377 --> 03:54:49.039]  They have had unfettered access to any witness they want who's of any significance whatsoever.
[03:54:49.039 --> 03:54:50.879]  They're empty-handed, folks.
[03:54:50.879 --> 03:54:53.240]  They have nothing.
[03:54:53.240 --> 03:55:00.341]  And now the noose is tightening around John Brennan, the quarterback of this entire evil scheme.
[03:55:01.561 --> 03:55:05.845]  Side note, you may remember General James Clapper.
[03:55:05.845 --> 03:55:11.710]  He's another one of the ringleaders in this phony Russian collusion delusion.
[03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:22.718]  He's the guy who testified under oath in front of the Senate that, oh no, America doesn't have any metadata collection program.
[03:55:22.718 --> 03:55:26.161]  We're not collecting information on the American people.
[03:55:27.282 --> 03:55:37.030]  That is until Edward Snowden released materials that proved that Clapper was what I would call a stone-cold liar.
[03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:39.892]  So now you may ask, where is Clapper?
[03:55:39.892 --> 03:55:41.593]  Is he in federal prison?
[03:55:41.593 --> 03:55:43.535]  Is he in... where is he?
[03:55:43.535 --> 03:55:45.196]  I'll tell you where he is.
[03:55:45.196 --> 03:55:48.198]  He's teaching ethics at Vermont College.
[03:55:49.059 --> 03:55:50.580]  Extraordinary.
[03:55:50.580 --> 03:56:00.303]  So, in other words, when you point to a situation like this, when I was interviewed by the BBC, they asked me why I don't believe the intelligence community.
[03:56:00.303 --> 03:56:06.385]  When I cited this example, well, they edited that out of my BBC interview.
[03:56:06.385 --> 03:56:07.586]  How convenient.
[03:56:08.746 --> 03:56:35.825]  Once again, folks, if you like our expanded coverage here at InfoWars, if you're liking The Real News with David Knight, if you love what Owen Schroyer and I are doing at The War Room, if you like the way Alex Jones gets right to the point and brings you the very best news that the mainstream media won't cover, remember that none of it is at all possible without your loyal support at the InfoWars store.
[03:56:36.505 --> 03:56:41.486]  We don't have any corporate sponsors telling us what we can cover and what we can't.
[03:56:41.486 --> 03:56:44.627]  We don't have any conservative fat cats.
[03:56:44.627 --> 03:56:51.968]  There is no George Soros or Jeff Bezos standing in the wings supplementing the work that we do here.
[03:56:51.968 --> 03:56:54.649]  We can only count on you.
[03:56:54.649 --> 03:57:02.671]  And Alex Jones has really gone the extra mile to provide some of the greatest all-natural products on the market.
[03:57:03.231 --> 03:57:06.813]  They're greatly superior to what you can get at Whole Foods.
[03:57:06.813 --> 03:57:07.493]  I know.
[03:57:07.493 --> 03:57:09.214]  I've used both.
[03:57:09.214 --> 03:57:20.920]  And if you were watching the show earlier, you've heard my first-hand testimonial of my reliance on Brain Force Plus, on Immune Wall, on Silver Bullet.
[03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:22.441]  So do yourself a favor.
[03:57:22.441 --> 03:57:25.223]  Help us expand the revolution.
[03:57:25.223 --> 03:57:27.764]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:57:27.764 --> 03:57:29.665]  We will fight for you.
[03:57:29.665 --> 03:57:31.446]  But you need to have our back.
[03:57:32.006 --> 03:57:36.087]  And you can have our back by going to the InfoWars store now.
[03:57:36.087 --> 03:57:37.188]  God bless you.
[03:57:37.188 --> 03:57:38.588]  God bless America.
[03:57:38.588 --> 03:57:40.749]  Let's make America great again.
[03:57:46.856 --> 03:57:48.777]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:57:48.777 --> 03:57:59.301]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:57:59.301 --> 03:58:05.744]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:58:05.744 --> 03:58:08.125]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:58:08.866 --> 03:58:09.346]  Thank you.
[03:58:09.346 --> 03:58:09.627]  Absolutely.
[03:58:25.889 --> 03:58:38.796]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:58:44.804 --> 03:58:53.046]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[03:58:53.046 --> 03:58:54.266]  A 360 win.
[03:58:54.266 --> 03:59:00.847]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[03:59:00.847 --> 03:59:08.349]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:59:08.769 --> 03:59:13.830]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:19.932]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:59:19.932 --> 03:59:27.734]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:59:27.734 --> 03:59:34.936]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:59:34.936 --> 03:59:35.736]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:59:35.916 --> 03:59:38.338]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[03:59:38.338 --> 03:59:40.320]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[03:59:40.320 --> 03:59:47.788]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:59:47.788 --> 03:59:50.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
