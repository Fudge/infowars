[00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.791]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:14.435]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:44.034]  Since the end of the Civil War, we have not seen a Republican president, two years into his term, keep the House of Representatives and the U.S.
[00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:44.354]  Senate.
[00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:55.363]  But we've seen a major political realignment, not just here but around the world, against globalism, against modern, collectivist, corporate, crony capitalism.
[00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:21.123]  We have seen a major political realignment, but they've got the New York Times and the usual suspects, The Hill, coming out and saying, top analysts, dims, now favored to take the house in the midterms, but embarrassed by all of their fake predictions before, they say this is a soft prediction.
[00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:27.071]  So they are creating the illusion that the Democrats are going to win.
[00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:29.514]  And, of course, San Francisco just passed a law.
[00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:34.620]  They did this, too, several years ago.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.185]  But then the state threatened them, so they removed it because it was going to bring federal regulators in.
[00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.348]  And they said, listen, just cover up.
[00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.534]  Just go ahead and let the illegals vote and vote the names of dead people on the voter registration rolls.
[00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:50.235]  Don't make it so obvious.
[00:01:50.855 --> 00:02:00.363]  But towns in Illinois, towns in Vermont, towns in New Hampshire, towns in California, towns in a whole bunch of states.
[00:02:01.223 --> 00:02:08.789]  Last time I saw, 14 states were passing or had passed laws so that illegal aliens could vote.
[00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.411]  There's NBC News.
[00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:12.612]  But if you go to Snopes,
[00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:21.168]  Funded by George Soros, it says that I have made that up, and that Trump has made that up, and that Democrats don't want illegals to be able to vote.
[00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:35.392]  A year and a half ago, Illinois passed it in the legislature, and then the governor didn't sign it, saying, even though I agree everyone in the country deserves representation, we have to change the federal law.
[00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:41.154]  So they play this, they play this mind game.
[00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:45.905]  Where they're bringing in all these illegal aliens.
[00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:48.467]  They're brainwashing them into being collectivists.
[00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:50.889]  A lot of them are coming out of Venezuela and other communist countries.
[00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.975]  And then they turn around and play this game where they go, nobody's trying to let illegals vote.
[00:02:57.995 --> 00:02:58.676]  That's just insane.
[00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:00.117]  And Trump's insane.
[00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:01.098]  Nobody voted illegally.
[00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.461]  And we have countless videos all over the country of the Democrats.
[00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:08.744]  Project Veritas and others have gone and just bragging, oh yeah, we bust the homeless around.
[00:03:08.804 --> 00:03:10.226]  We bust the illegals around.
[00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:15.480]  And we get them to vote, you know, ten times for Democrats on average.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.581]  That's the standard.
[00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:20.704]  About ten polling places is what they visit a day, and they get them out, call everything else.
[00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:29.609]  See, illegal aliens, though, on average are more moral than the homeless folks, and there's not actually a huge illegal alien voting problem.
[00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.613]  That's why they're legalizing it, and then the illegals will go vote.
[00:03:36.752 --> 00:03:42.957]  That's why Obama said during the campaign, six months before the election, 2016, he said, oh, it's the responsibility of immigrants to vote.
[00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.561]  And to vote as much as they can, repeatedly.
[00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:48.522]  Wasn't even veiled.
[00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:54.388]  Because they want to tell the illegals, yes, you're allowed to vote.
[00:03:54.428 --> 00:04:03.716]  That's why the Democrats are first making it, we don't need any citizenship to get a driver's license, and then with that driver's license, you can vote.
[00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:11.692]  And then other states try to pass citizenship laws to get a driver's license, or at least green card.
[00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:13.795]  And they say, oh my god, that's insane.
[00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:15.617]  No one wants to have illegals vote.
[00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:18.802]  This is the game they play, hoping you're stupid.
[00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:24.610]  So a whole bunch of big cities have already legalized illegals voting, like Chicago, San Francisco.
[00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:30.355]  And I just wanted to start the broadcast with that today, because they say there's this big Democrat wave, and oh my gosh, they're going to win.
[00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.797]  And the only way they're going to win is with massive election fraud.
[00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:37.560]  So we need to be at the polling places, watching and documenting this, Project Veritas type stuff.
[00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:40.322]  We need to be out there exposing it.
[00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:43.945]  And every patriot needs to absolutely vote.
[00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:48.088]  And go get your grandma, your grandpa, put them in the wheelchair if you have to, out of the nursing home.
[00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.810]  Take them down there and have them vote.
[00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.198]  Because this is the critical fight to try to save this country non-violently, and Trump's doing a great job getting ready to revoke these traders' security clearances.
[00:04:57.218 --> 00:05:00.582]  We'll look at all that, the Israeli shoot-down of a Syrian plane, and more, straight ahead.
[00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:09.788]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:15.592]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[00:05:15.952 --> 00:05:22.616]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:26.519]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.962]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:32.663]  And my only message is this.
[00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:36.006]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:44.332]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:47.675]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:48.596]  We already have the power.
[00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:53.760]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.041]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.622]  We are the resistance!
[00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:08.806]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:14.469]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:49.284]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:55.145]  I am your host Alex Jones, and we are going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:59.926]  Paul Watson is coming up co-hosting in the fourth hour today.
[00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:14.649]  Now, Trump is definitely moving in the right direction now with the move to pull the security clearances of the traitors, like Clapper,
[00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:20.000]  Brennan, Comey, and many others.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:32.487]  Because these are deep state, CHICOM funded, globalists, who see America as their enemy, and as their happy hunting ground, with a bunch of gullible schmucks they can feed off of.
[00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:43.553]  Kevin Clapper, I'm gonna play the clip in a moment, and others, get up on television, on the Communist News Network, and tell you,
[00:07:44.784 --> 00:07:51.467]  On Wolf Blitzer's program, when Wolf Blitzer is a known Mossad Israeli agent, that's declassified.
[00:07:52.148 --> 00:08:01.672]  And when Anderson Cooper isn't just a famous blue-blood robber baron family, the Astors, he's CIA.
[00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:06.935]  The point is it's not CIA, it's Globalist Foundations in Foreign Interest.
[00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:13.917]  That basically combine in CNN as an information warfare operation against America.
[00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:20.839]  They're paid by Gulf states, they're paid by Communist China, billions of dollars to engage in their criminal activity against this country.
[00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:24.740]  And so Trump is now exposing that whole situation.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.381]  But when they say, oh, it's a national security threat for you to do this, but we don't care.
[00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:30.881]  It's no big deal.
[00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.082]  We don't get security briefings anymore.
[00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:49.840]  It allows them to talk to people who are still inside the government, the stay-behind networks that they admit they have, three or four levels down, blocking Trump at every level and engaging in mutiny and complete and total sabotage.
[00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:59.009]  So they can start being indicted right away when they still leak classified info about the peace deals in North Korea,
[00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:01.742]  Or what's happening in Syria.
[00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.523]  They're working against U.S.
[00:09:03.703 --> 00:09:04.103]  interest.
[00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:06.263]  And that's not rhetoric when we say it.
[00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:22.527]  Brennan, in college and then out of college, was a devout member of the Communist Party, voted for Communist Party presidential candidates USA, and told New Yorker magazine just a few years ago that he was proud to vote Communist.
[00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:25.607]  That's right.
[00:09:27.548 --> 00:09:29.128]  He then converted to the most radical
[00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:36.110]  This is a form of Islam that Al-Qaeda and ISIS follow when he was the CIA section chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.873]  This is public information, the FBI has released it, that he converted to Wahhabism.
[00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.556]  So of course Obama put him in charge.
[00:09:45.777 --> 00:09:48.819]  And he says, oh, I don't even need it, but don't take it.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.621]  Trying to play mind games.
[00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:58.366]  He absolutely wants that security clearance so he can continue to be given classified information by
[00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:01.309]  Other criminals inside the government.
[00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:08.916]  I'm going to explain something again, because I'm starting to see Tucker Carlson talk about it, Sean Hannity, that's a good thing, and the President starting to hammer, because it's fact.
[00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:16.204]  The Office of Personnel Management, 21 million names, people are like, Alex, you have hundreds of articles, they're all important, why are you telling us something you say every day?
[00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:20.649]  Because, I said, you expose global government, it's corporate, free market,
[00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:28.017]  But not for the general public, tax-exempt, and that it wants you poor living under socialism, but it is exempt, it will fall.
[00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:29.558]  It's falling worldwide.
[00:10:30.118 --> 00:10:37.702]  They thought we were that dumb, they could bring in a planetary corporate government, tax-exempt above the law, to then raise our taxes, and break up our families, and dumb us down.
[00:10:39.343 --> 00:10:39.984]  It's the same thing.
[00:10:40.544 --> 00:10:46.267]  Hillary, in secret meetings with Putin, now admitting it, saying she bonded with him, did secret uranium deals with him.
[00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:47.528]  It's over for them!
[00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.109]  We have the Ace of Spades, play it.
[00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:53.274]  So I will battering ram this stuff until it gets out there.
[00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:59.660]  And then the Chai comms and the Office of Personnel Management, 21 million names given by Obama to the Chinese.
[00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:01.982]  Those names aren't in one place.
[00:11:02.502 --> 00:11:05.625]  Those names are in computer vaults that aren't even wired to the internet.
[00:11:06.926 --> 00:11:10.430]  They were downloaded and they were delivered to the Communist Chinese.
[00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:11.751]  We know that.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.243]  And they're using it for an infiltration model of the universities as their command bases with a Maoist plan.
[00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:20.423]  This is all coming out now.
[00:11:20.943 --> 00:11:22.424]  Even the Washington Post had a report on it.
[00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:24.365]  It's basically a loyalty test two months ago.
[00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:33.969]  That all 50 major public schools in the United States had basically gone under full QICOM control and that they found that they would put them in charge with their operatives.
[00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:51.478]  Not just people from China, but their operatives, if they had pledged loyalty to the Communist Party, had pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist, and had pledged loyalty to the Council on Foreign Relations, and then they would put them in the hiring facilities at the schools to then bring in all their people.
[00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:54.940]  We are close to death as a nation.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.021]  We are completely overrun.
[00:11:57.522 --> 00:11:59.403]  Trump is a last-ditch effort to turn this around.
[00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:01.025]  People say, well, why doesn't he just come out and say all that?
[00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:04.187]  Because if he says it too quickly, it'll crash the stock market.
[00:12:04.207 --> 00:12:05.408]  It'll sound completely insane.
[00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:15.157]  That's why these Chi-Com globalist operatives, the big banks allied with the unelected EU, the Communist Chinese, this was all at Davos a year and a half ago, go back.
[00:12:15.477 --> 00:12:16.038]  China admitted.
[00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:16.998]  They said, we're all merged.
[00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.360]  We will defeat America as a combination.
[00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:22.303]  Okay?
[00:12:24.238 --> 00:12:25.921]  So, so, it's here.
[00:12:25.941 --> 00:12:29.626]  And you have to understand, the globalists set China up to do this.
[00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.547]  This has all been planned.
[00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.176]  And so, Trump now moving against these people is absolutely critical.
[00:12:37.332 --> 00:12:38.112]  They are arrogant.
[00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:38.813]  They are traitors.
[00:12:38.853 --> 00:12:40.474]  They are the worst people on the planet.
[00:12:40.494 --> 00:12:45.497]  If you're a TV viewer, just look at this photo of these guys testifying to Congress.
[00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:47.358]  Brennan, Clapper, and Cummings.
[00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.900]  Look at the insane mental illness arrogance of these people.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:13:04.928]  They were all hired and vetted because in college they wrote thesis, especially Clapper and Brennan, on how much they hated capitalism, how much they hated America, and how much they had been thoroughbred prepared to bring the country down.
[00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:10.862]  Now there it is, New Yorker Magazine.
[00:13:11.282 --> 00:13:13.622]  CIA director reveals he was a communist sympathizer.
[00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:17.804]  Voted for the communist presidential candidate twice.
[00:13:18.784 --> 00:13:20.365]  Snopes says it's not true.
[00:13:21.085 --> 00:13:32.169]  Snopes says that if the fire department Catholic crosses are Nazi, they say they control reality.
[00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.230]  This is what they do.
[00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:39.364]  This is their sick behavior.
[00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:43.445]  But these are the people that think America is theirs.
[00:13:43.665 --> 00:13:44.326]  Look at them.
[00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:46.826]  Pledged to destroy you.
[00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:48.867]  Pledged for total control.
[00:13:49.847 --> 00:13:51.407]  And they thought that they had won.
[00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:54.208]  We are still in the thick of a very serious battle, but that's happening.
[00:13:54.228 --> 00:13:56.749]  We're going to come back and play all the clips of them freaking out about it.
[00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:04.631]  Also, we're going to look at the Denver Post runs an article calling, demanding for Trump to be executed.
[00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:07.899]  This is the insane situation we're in.
[00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:15.085]  Also, there's a big Disinfo article by George Soros in Media Matters saying that Alex Jones pantomimed shooting Robert Mueller.
[00:14:15.325 --> 00:14:15.785]  No, I didn't.
[00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:23.851]  Any more than saying Texas and OU football teams have the Red River shootout, and so that means they're all going to go shoot each other.
[00:14:24.772 --> 00:14:28.575]  I said politically, it's high noon with the globalists, and we're not going to flinch.
[00:14:28.975 --> 00:14:31.497]  And in the information war, we're blowing the hell out of them.
[00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:34.239]  Everybody knows when you say, boy, you know,
[00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:42.380]  Tackler killed that guy, or Trump's killing it, or Trump's slaughtering the deep staters.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.120]  It doesn't mean that.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.801]  They're the ones calling for violence everywhere, every day.
[00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:46.922]  We're calling for peace.
[00:14:46.982 --> 00:14:50.383]  Last thing I want is Mueller to end up being a martyr.
[00:14:50.403 --> 00:14:57.466]  That's the only card they've got, is killing Obama, or Mueller, calling him Mueller, and just all of it.
[00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:58.426]  That's all they've got.
[00:14:59.807 --> 00:15:01.508]  Wound up mental patient killing Hillary.
[00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.868]  We certainly don't want that.
[00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:07.731]  We want them very, very healthy so they can all be indicted and then end up getting sent to prison.
[00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:11.192]  We're going to go to break and come back with all this news and more on the other side.
[00:15:12.192 --> 00:15:12.833]  I did it again.
[00:15:13.193 --> 00:15:13.813]  We are running.
[00:15:14.273 --> 00:15:15.554]  This is the biggest special ever.
[00:15:15.574 --> 00:15:17.735]  I keep escalating them because you respond, you like it.
[00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:20.938]  Uh, but we have to sell a lot of product to fund the operation at sales like this.
[00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:22.340]  We will have new sales tomorrow.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.945]  This is the last day for Defeat the Democrat censorship plan to destroy InfoWars.
[00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:30.609]  Super sale at 67% off and store-wide free shipping.
[00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.971]  It's gotta end today.
[00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:33.372]  It'll probably go down tonight because...
[00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:37.475]  I got a couple new products that are coming in, some new specials that are limited, but still really good.
[00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:38.195]  We're gonna run tomorrow.
[00:15:38.455 --> 00:15:43.897]  But right now, this is unbelievable sale on DNA Force, Alpha Power, all these big specials.
[00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:48.159]  X2, you need to experience all these great products for yourself and help fund this operation.

[00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:55.122]  Take advantage of this incredible sale and find out how game-changing these products are.
[00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:58.544]  A lot of great t-shirts as well at mfulworestore.com.
[00:15:58.944 --> 00:16:00.245]  Alright, tomorrow's the news today.
[00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:01.005]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:05.337]  The deep state is making its move.
[00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:13.589]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA are all on television saying we need the military to remove the president.
[00:16:14.463 --> 00:16:19.585]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.045]  And why?
[00:16:20.465 --> 00:16:33.550]  Because he went and had a summit, a year and a half plus into office, that he should have had a month into office, with Vladimir Putin, and met with him privately, just like he did with Theresa May, and dozens of other world leaders, like the communist Chinese dictator.
[00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.871]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:45.613]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[00:16:45.693 --> 00:16:50.515]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.415]  It's incredible!
[00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:53.015]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.976]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:58.497]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[00:16:59.693 --> 00:17:11.279]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.300]  The EU is unelected.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.301]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:18.963]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[00:17:19.003 --> 00:17:19.943]  We have nothing on them.
[00:17:20.383 --> 00:17:23.065]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:24.806]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:29.591]  It's America first, our military, our borders, our everything.
[00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:31.373]  That's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[00:17:31.813 --> 00:17:33.775]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[00:17:34.276 --> 00:17:41.163]  Democrat Appellate Court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:42.845]  They hate flyover country.
[00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:43.946]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:45.887]  The universities hate America.
[00:17:46.027 --> 00:17:46.887]  They hate free speech.
[00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:49.069]  They're the party of globalism.
[00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:51.210]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:57.555]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[00:17:57.775 --> 00:17:58.735]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[00:17:59.076 --> 00:18:00.336]  They're the ones of fake news.
[00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:01.737]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[00:18:01.817 --> 00:18:05.180]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:11.384]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[00:18:11.764 --> 00:18:12.445]  They're the enemy.
[00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:31.378]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be meeting with him and talking to him, that he's a traitor, and that the military needs to remove him?
[00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:34.201]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:37.905]  It's just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[00:18:38.265 --> 00:18:39.327]  They openly admit it.
[00:18:39.767 --> 00:18:41.189]  They are the clear and present danger.
[00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.371]  They're the globalists.
[00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:43.252]  They're the deep state.
[00:18:43.512 --> 00:18:48.518]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.220]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:51.522]  We're sovereign.
[00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:53.144]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:56.966]  Russia has the same enemy as us, George Soros.
[00:18:56.986 --> 00:19:05.831]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does it make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:09.492]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[00:19:10.013 --> 00:19:12.874]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:14.655]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[00:19:14.995 --> 00:19:17.156]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.116]  But they're not.
[00:19:18.537 --> 00:19:21.078]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[00:19:21.938 --> 00:19:24.580]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:31.485]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:32.506]  And so is Trump.
[00:19:32.826 --> 00:19:36.769]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:40.251]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:44.154]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:46.396]  They are the threat to this nation.
[00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:50.779]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:54.401]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:55.822]  The year is 2018.
[00:19:56.683 --> 00:19:57.544]  History's happening now.
[00:19:58.024 --> 00:19:59.525]  Choose which side you're on.
[00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.863]  We are drugged out!
[00:20:16.504 --> 00:20:18.768]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:20:19.935 --> 00:20:22.197]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:20:22.737 --> 00:20:24.298]  Today, it all changes.
[00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.140]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.201]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:20:30.422 --> 00:20:34.944]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:20:35.185 --> 00:20:38.066]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:40.368]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:20:40.688 --> 00:20:42.649]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:43.129 --> 00:20:44.550]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.692]  We have the resources for
[00:20:47.472 --> 00:20:49.814]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:50.475]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:18.373 --> 00:21:21.234]  George Soros runs the corporate media in this country.
[00:21:22.274 --> 00:21:29.257]  Media Matters puts out their spin against President Trump, against myself and others, and the media takes it and then expands on that.
[00:21:30.697 --> 00:21:35.719]  They had congressional hearings last week where they said that I said no one died at Parkland and that they were all crisis actors.
[00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:36.979]  Never said that.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.940]  Total fraud, total lie, doesn't matter.
[00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:45.702]  Well, the latest thing was an allegory yesterday where I 100% said politically
[00:21:48.447 --> 00:21:50.688]  We are destroying the deep state and the globalists.
[00:21:52.448 --> 00:21:53.929]  Like the Red River Shootout.
[00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:56.990]  UT versus Oklahoma.
[00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.730]  They play up at the Cotton Bowl in Texas.
[00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.871]  North Texas.
[00:22:00.271 --> 00:22:01.851]  Halfway between the two schools.
[00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:03.712]  And they call it the Red River Shootout.
[00:22:03.732 --> 00:22:05.252]  Does that mean people are shooting anybody?
[00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:09.694]  I don't want anything to happen to Robert Mueller.
[00:22:09.714 --> 00:22:12.334]  I don't want anything to happen to Hillary.
[00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:17.536]  The only way they could beat us now is a big false flag against Hillary or Obama or Mueller.
[00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:26.041]  I said, politically, it's high noon, and I'm marching in against Robert Mueller.
[00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:39.231]  And then, I said, when it comes time for them to politically draw, we're going to, just like I was five years old, dressed up in a cowboy outfit after Christmas, like a Western.
[00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:43.955]  A five-year-old would understand what I was saying.
[00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:46.177]  We call for peace.
[00:22:46.337 --> 00:22:46.697]  We call
[00:22:47.813 --> 00:22:48.713]  For not having violence.
[00:22:49.114 --> 00:22:50.955]  The Democrats are in the news every day.
[00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:54.596]  Denver Post publishing stuff calling for Trump's execution.
[00:22:56.117 --> 00:23:00.579]  Mudd goes on TV of the CIA and FBI and says the deep state's going to kill Trump.
[00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:01.580]  We all know about it.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.420]  We've all seen it.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.701]  It takes hours to go over it.
[00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:05.882]  How they want to kidnap his family and rape his kids.
[00:23:07.483 --> 00:23:12.245]  So Media Matters says Alex Jones pantomimes shooting Robert Mueller.
[00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:15.347]  Because even they knew it was clear that I wasn't
[00:23:16.448 --> 00:23:30.822]  Saying I physically wanted to do it, but because I made the motion politically, they then said, oh my gosh, look, he's threatening the special counsel and Lord Rosenstein and all the rest of it.
[00:23:31.183 --> 00:23:36.848]  But then by the time it gets to the Hill, that's got a special hatred for me, Alex Jones threatens Mueller.
[00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.251]  You're going to get it or I'm going to die trying.
[00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:43.956]  But the good part about this is, I did this on purpose yesterday.
[00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:46.618]  In a split second, I said, I'm so mad at him.
[00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:48.839]  Pull up articles on this guy, search engine.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.102]  Jeffrey Epstein was given immunity by Mueller.
[00:23:54.703 --> 00:24:01.327]  He was a informant for a decade, blackmailing politicians and others on the Alita Express sex plane.
[00:24:02.921 --> 00:24:04.523]  So you guys took the bait.
[00:24:04.703 --> 00:24:06.545]  Hook, line, and shanker.
[00:24:06.665 --> 00:24:09.508]  And I wanted to wait because Media Matters ran it last night.
[00:24:09.588 --> 00:24:10.469]  Nobody picked it up.
[00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:15.835]  And I was kind of upset this morning because now it'll chain reaction though.
[00:24:15.895 --> 00:24:17.237]  Now it's in.
[00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.366]  The hill and it's proliferating.
[00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:22.287]  Yeah!
[00:24:23.448 --> 00:24:24.629]  Got you, baby!
[00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:30.536]  Oh, you took the bait, sweetheart.
[00:24:32.317 --> 00:24:33.278]  And that's what I'm saying.
[00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.901]  At high noon, I'm gonna get you politically.
[00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:38.244]  I'm gonna get you good.
[00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:42.029]  Gonna get you fast, before you ever knew what hit ya.
[00:24:42.449 --> 00:24:43.590]  No matter what happened to me.
[00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.831]  You see what I just did?
[00:24:45.611 --> 00:24:46.512]  See what I just did?
[00:24:46.532 --> 00:24:49.114]  I knew they love lies.
[00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:52.937]  So they'd take what I said and act like I said I was gonna shoot Mueller.
[00:24:53.137 --> 00:24:54.218]  The last thing I'd ever do.
[00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.701]  In fact, I hope he gets all his medical checkups.
[00:24:58.021 --> 00:24:59.302]  Lives a long time in federal prison.
[00:25:00.503 --> 00:25:04.446]  Hope he spends the next 30 years of his miserable, evil, traitorous life in there.
[00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:10.191]  With his uranium deals to Russia and all the rest of his covering up for the Clintons and the Bushes and 9-11.
[00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:10.851]  He's a monster.
[00:25:11.952 --> 00:25:12.992]  He knows where the bodies are buried.
[00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:20.534]  So, now they took the bait.
[00:25:20.674 --> 00:25:23.034]  They took what I said that was 100% an allegory.
[00:25:23.074 --> 00:25:29.276]  I said politically, I'll meet him at high noon and defeat him and that we're going to win this thing politically.
[00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:32.284]  Like Red River Shootout is a sports analogy.
[00:25:32.624 --> 00:25:33.044]  Are they really?
[00:25:34.145 --> 00:25:39.550]  Is the Texas University, UT going up to Dallas and meeting the OU folks?
[00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.451]  Are they shooting each other?
[00:25:40.471 --> 00:25:40.731]  No.
[00:25:42.072 --> 00:25:43.413]  Any moron would know what I said.
[00:25:45.675 --> 00:25:47.296]  But see, that's not why I did it.
[00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:50.792]  I did it because I knew they'd jump on it.
[00:25:51.672 --> 00:26:01.495]  And I said the Jeffrey Epstein stuff right in the short clip so they'd have trouble editing it, and now the fact that he protected the Clintons and the pedophile rigs is all over the news.
[00:26:02.275 --> 00:26:04.836]  Oh, this is luscious!
[00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:06.316]  I told you, Mauler!
[00:26:07.537 --> 00:26:09.157]  I told you, you wicked devil.
[00:26:09.677 --> 00:26:10.658]  I told you.
[00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:17.780]  So, Sonny Boy, that's how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.982]  You walked into that one, didn't you Soros, you old Nazi collaborator dirtbag?
[00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.083]  As y'all folks go, this guy's crazy.
[00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:35.885]  He's going up against this criminal Mueller that, you know, does all this stuff.
[00:26:35.905 --> 00:26:36.605]  What's he thinking?
[00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:41.527]  Folks, we're going to lose if we are afraid of these people.
[00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:51.552]  And I already told you, I wasn't an active participant in almost all of it, but one, but I'm guilty for paying for abortions, usually after the fact.
[00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:53.246]  And I feel guilty.
[00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:55.907]  So whatever happens to me, I deserve.
[00:26:56.507 --> 00:26:57.308]  But let's be clear.
[00:26:57.968 --> 00:27:01.269]  I didn't let people fly around on airplanes for a decade raping little kidnapped girls.
[00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:04.010]  I didn't want part of that and using it to blackmail everybody.
[00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.851]  That's who needs to get in trouble.
[00:27:07.611 --> 00:27:08.851]  And he's going to get in trouble.
[00:27:09.652 --> 00:27:12.093]  And you're all going to get in trouble that sell this globalism.
[00:27:13.693 --> 00:27:15.054]  So I'm going to explain again.
[00:27:15.094 --> 00:27:15.894]  I'm a shock troop.
[00:27:16.974 --> 00:27:21.115]  I am hitting the barbed wire, I'm hitting the beaches, it's my job and I'm here to do it.
[00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:23.755]  And if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it 110%.
[00:27:24.215 --> 00:27:25.616]  Everybody just needs to understand that.
[00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:33.257]  And when it's all said and done, if I get killed or set up or put in prison, it isn't because they won or they had power.
[00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:37.338]  It's because I chose to step into the arena to bring them down on me.
[00:27:38.098 --> 00:27:41.479]  Because I've got even bigger plans in fifth dimensional chess.
[00:27:41.939 --> 00:27:43.499]  I don't know if Trump plays it, but I do.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.683]  When I go with my instincts and my gut with these people, I can beat them every single time.
[00:27:49.703 --> 00:28:08.595]  They're all these Ivy League candy ashes that all get up there and try to show off to each other how tough they are, and they go along with the system, and then they sell out to the Chi-Coms and the big banks, and they all have a trained heart on for the Midwest and America and Texas and Christians and gun owners, and they think we are idiots.
[00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:12.478]  We broke five days before anybody else that Tony Podesta
[00:28:13.587 --> 00:28:24.311]  In between all of his pedophile art, which he put in the Washington Post, in fact, and all his other sick behavior, got immunity to testify against Manafort and, you know, tell a bunch of big fish stories.
[00:28:26.051 --> 00:28:26.732]  Look at that face.
[00:28:26.752 --> 00:28:27.772]  Looks like Dennis Hastert, doesn't he?
[00:28:30.011 --> 00:28:41.999]  See, their undoing would be, they did a coming out in 2007, 2009, where they had all these directors and all these people and all these lobbyists come out and say, oh, I got pictures of naked kids on my walls, I like it.
[00:28:42.999 --> 00:28:45.321]  He had that in the Washington Post in 2007.
[00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:48.483]  So now it's all coming out, see, and it's all this sick crew.
[00:28:48.963 --> 00:28:58.810]  Now, I've never gotten any intel that Mueller actually diddles the kids himself, but he sure videotapes it all in the big mansions and the jet aircraft and they use it to totally blackmail all the billionaires.
[00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:09.141]  Alex Jones here with unbelievably critical information concerning the future of our Republic.
[00:29:09.821 --> 00:29:17.343]  A year and a half ago, just a few months into President Trump being in office, the globalists panicked because the economy began to turn around.
[00:29:19.643 --> 00:29:32.247]  Former Obama administration officials, former deputy heads of the Defense Department and others went to the Pentagon and to Congress and were even in major news publications like Atlantic Monthly
[00:29:33.246 --> 00:29:40.591]  Developing a public plan for a military coup against the president or a 25th amendment removal.
[00:29:41.472 --> 00:29:48.856]  I covered it at the time and mainstream corporate media attacked me and said it wasn't true because they didn't want to have major attention on it.
[00:29:48.937 --> 00:29:52.499]  They only wanted it in establishment publications like Atlantic Monthly.
[00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:55.061]  They did not want to be seen by the general public.
[00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:57.242]  They didn't want to have a debate about it early on.
[00:29:57.482 --> 00:30:03.126]  They wanted to build their false case over the next year or so and then make their move on the president.
[00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:06.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now making that move.
[00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:12.494]  In the last 24 hours, we've seen the former head of the CIA Brennan say that Trump is nothing short of treasonous.
[00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:13.955]  When it's Brennan that's the traitor.
[00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:19.920]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has said that the military needs to take him out.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.660]  Where are they?
[00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:21.861]  Needs to remove them.
[00:30:22.482 --> 00:30:26.045]  Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA and the FBI,
[00:30:26.685 --> 00:30:26.905]  We're good.
[00:30:52.588 --> 00:30:55.429]  And the globalists know that as everything we've talked about
[00:31:14.036 --> 00:31:14.196]  It's
[00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:40.621]  Defeat the Democrat-Globalist censorship plan.

[00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:19.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven ourselves.
[00:32:19.402 --> 00:32:20.342]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:32:20.402 --> 00:32:23.244]  And we have this great crew standing in the face of this.
[00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:30.228]  And we have you, the listeners, and the viewers that support us, that make it possible, that pray for us, that share the articles and videos, and amplify our work.
[00:32:30.528 --> 00:32:31.449]  You are the InfoWars.
[00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:44.221]  Americana and true freedom and true Western civilization and true Christianity is the light of the world and we're bringing it back into the world boldly and the enemy is attacking us because they know we have the answer.
[00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.604]  We have the light in the dark of the night and so do all of you.
[00:32:47.884 --> 00:32:48.745]  So I ask you today
[00:32:49.065 --> 00:32:50.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:24.412 --> 00:33:26.973]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[00:33:27.993 --> 00:33:29.733]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:37.035]  I am your kamikaze patriot.
[00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:39.296]  We're winning the war.
[00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:40.996]  We've already defeated the globalists.
[00:33:42.877 --> 00:33:45.178]  Unless they try to totally launch a new world war.
[00:33:45.198 --> 00:33:47.078]  And they'll lose that as well.
[00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:48.959]  They're done.
[00:33:49.239 --> 00:33:50.019]  They already know they're defeated.
[00:33:51.618 --> 00:33:55.540]  They're just figuring out some alternate ending where they can get out of this with their hides.
[00:34:01.242 --> 00:34:04.644]  There's nothing like karmic enforcement, isn't there?
[00:34:27.253 --> 00:34:28.133]  Hard to turn that off.
[00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:31.435]  That's the guy from the Eagles.
[00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:32.616]  His own solo career.
[00:34:32.836 --> 00:34:33.736]  Good stuff, man.
[00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:35.337]  Taking a ride.
[00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:41.460]  Mueller ain't gonna beat the rap, he ain't gonna beat the ride.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.041]  Because the ride is the rap, brother.
[00:34:49.104 --> 00:34:50.964]  Unbelievable lies.
[00:34:51.225 --> 00:34:53.906]  I made it totally clear that I wasn't threatening Mueller.
[00:34:56.084 --> 00:35:02.126]  Physically, I was threatening him metaphysically, politically, culturally.
[00:35:03.147 --> 00:35:04.467]  You want to assassinate my name?
[00:35:05.568 --> 00:35:06.908]  Brother, I'm an open book.
[00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:09.629]  You are not.
[00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.210]  And now the season has come.
[00:35:13.651 --> 00:35:15.352]  The season of exposure.
[00:35:17.632 --> 00:35:18.693]  Seasons of the abyss.
[00:35:21.792 --> 00:35:25.495]  Where your protection of massive international pedophile rings are coming out.
[00:35:26.796 --> 00:35:30.398]  And I love how the media picks this up and doesn't even deny it.
[00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:44.789]  Because it's even in the New York Times that he let Epstein get off with sex with seven-year-olds and over a decade of recording billionaire men having sex with girls 16 down to 7.
[00:35:46.766 --> 00:36:02.307]  And go into these Mediterranean islands and these Islamic caliphate bases with these sheiks that have modern harems to kidnap Western women and children and then the Caribbean islands and Clinton constantly on the aircraft.
[00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:03.409]  It's just disgusting.
[00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:10.049]  And Hillary's first job was protecting pedophiles and making jokes about it.
[00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:17.013]  But seven men gang-raped an 11-year-old girl till her cervix shattered and her guts came out.
[00:36:19.014 --> 00:36:21.315]  The woman has been here, in studio with me.
[00:36:22.896 --> 00:36:33.182]  Grabbed off her bicycle, outside Little Rock, taken to a cornfield, and raped for a day and a half by seven men, drunk on whiskey, local Richie Rich boys.
[00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:35.872]  Hillary got recorded.
[00:36:35.892 --> 00:36:36.592]  We played the recording.
[00:36:36.972 --> 00:36:41.955]  She knew they were guilty, but they passed a lot of checkers, and she thought it was so funny, and she cackles like a witch.
[00:36:42.336 --> 00:36:48.540]  Because, hey, you make your bones when you start protecting local rich boys that rape little girls, don't you?
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.982]  That's how you show the higher-ups you're ready to play ball.
[00:36:53.303 --> 00:37:01.128]  Her dad was a mob boss up in Chicago on record, and they sent their little girl down there to run some things on those hay seeds in Little Rock.
[00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:16.002]  And in Hot Springs, where the Mafia was actually really based, since the 20s, and ran the moonshine nationwide out in bottles of so-called mineral water on those trains.
[00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.103]  They'd deliver them right down here to Austin, right down to Houston.
[00:37:21.363 --> 00:37:23.444]  And the folks would load them off and ship them all over.
[00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:24.944]  I know because I had family involved.
[00:37:25.124 --> 00:37:28.305]  Shane Steiner's great-grandfather, Buck, ran it in Texas.
[00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:30.226]  Small world.
[00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:37.751]  But the whole point is, is that he sent his little daughter down there.
[00:37:38.952 --> 00:37:41.434]  She was in Time Live Books as a senior in high school.
[00:37:41.514 --> 00:37:42.635]  Time Live Magazine.
[00:37:42.915 --> 00:37:44.777]  They said this will be the first woman president.
[00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:48.831]  That smart little daughter of that mob boss, boy.
[00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:52.673]  She got kicked off the Watergate committee for creating lies about Nixon.
[00:37:53.374 --> 00:37:54.835]  She was an assistant on the committee.
[00:37:55.175 --> 00:38:01.118]  And then she went right down to Arkansas and said, they said, little girl, you got to represent pedophiles.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.022]  You got to represent them to show you're on the dark side.
[00:38:07.382 --> 00:38:10.384]  And she said, let me bathe in their pain.
[00:38:10.404 --> 00:38:13.426]  It's all an allegory.
[00:38:13.466 --> 00:38:14.127]  Hollywood knows it.
[00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:14.667]  It's their religion.
[00:38:19.462 --> 00:38:20.843]  George Lucas wrote episode 4.
[00:38:22.604 --> 00:38:24.586]  Star Wars is super cheesy except for the allegories.
[00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:27.668]  And then what does he tell the newly minted Darth Vader?
[00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:28.629]  What does Palpatine tell him?
[00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:33.152]  He goes, you must go to the Jedi Temple and kill all the younglings.
[00:38:33.452 --> 00:38:36.714]  Only then will you be powerful enough in the dark side.
[00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:39.176]  Go kill 400, 500 little kids.
[00:38:40.197 --> 00:38:43.940]  And then your journey towards the dark side will be complete.
[00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:50.065]  So they told Hillary, Go forth and represent the pedophiles!
[00:38:50.145 --> 00:38:51.205]  Defend them!
[00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:54.427]  And them having their will with children!
[00:38:55.248 --> 00:38:56.809]  Prove yourself, woman!
[00:38:57.289 --> 00:38:58.590]  Defile the children!
[00:39:01.831 --> 00:39:02.752]  Kill the child.
[00:39:03.172 --> 00:39:04.053]  Corrupt them all.
[00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:11.757]  Yes, hell awaits you.
[00:39:12.878 --> 00:39:14.599]  The jaws of hell open wide.
[00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:18.982]  The tongue slithers out.
[00:39:20.764 --> 00:39:22.465]  Hillary thinks she's the mouth of the tongue.
[00:39:22.845 --> 00:39:24.687]  Hillary is the hors d'oeuvre.
[00:39:25.287 --> 00:39:28.610]  Hillary is the rat servant of evil.
[00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:30.912]  Twisted and fallen.
[00:39:31.793 --> 00:39:32.914]  Prepared for hell.
[00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:39.239]  We're going to go to break because I want to come back and play all these clips of them panicking in full retreat.
[00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:46.881]  And the reason I'm poking the fetid pedophile nest is because it must be done.
[00:39:47.402 --> 00:39:53.984]  We have to stop living in fear of political correctness, being called Nazis, being called homophobes, being called all this made-up crud.
[00:39:55.965 --> 00:39:58.126]  Oh gosh, don't oppose them, they'll call you names.
[00:39:58.526 --> 00:39:58.946]  Good!
[00:40:01.778 --> 00:40:06.840]  I look at Mueller and his crooked little entourage coming into Congress and everyone groveling.
[00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:12.583]  You walk in your house and somebody's got a dog visiting and it rolls over, it's scared and it pees on itself.
[00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:20.107]  I watch America roll over on its back, show its belly and pee on itself in front of Mueller and I'm not doing it.
[00:40:22.412 --> 00:40:26.535]  I said politically, metaphysically, I'm banging heads with these people.
[00:40:26.895 --> 00:40:28.056]  Like a big battering ram.
[00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:30.978]  Drawing me back, beating the drums.
[00:40:31.138 --> 00:40:31.858]  Boom!
[00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:35.541]  I want to ram my head into their soul.
[00:40:36.502 --> 00:40:39.564]  I want to split my skull when theirs shatters.
[00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:46.208]  I want to stumble back and fall dead with my ancestors that were honorable as the enemy is defeated before me.
[00:40:46.789 --> 00:40:47.369]  Metaphysically.
[00:40:50.962 --> 00:40:52.483]  I want to play chicken.
[00:40:53.544 --> 00:40:56.646]  I want to stay on the road, true, like the North Star.
[00:40:57.047 --> 00:40:57.487]  Committed.
[00:40:58.347 --> 00:40:59.228]  Destined to victory.
[00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:03.871]  Destined to lay in the halls of those that were honorable.
[00:41:05.252 --> 00:41:06.493]  As an example to the future.
[00:41:08.035 --> 00:41:08.495]  I will!
[00:41:12.438 --> 00:41:12.878]  You will.
[00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:14.559]  This is spiritual.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.980]  This is the epic choice.
[00:41:16.381 --> 00:41:17.682]  And those monsters
[00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:20.592]  At the Clinton-controlled FBI at the top.
[00:41:21.392 --> 00:41:29.456]  I'm not defending the FBI, but if you sit there and say the whole FBI is corrupt, or even half of it's corrupt, you're helping the globalists, because the average person isn't corrupt in the FBI.
[00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:33.158]  I've looked into it and studied it, and they hear they're all corrupt, they think we're then full of bull.
[00:41:33.198 --> 00:41:44.564]  No, it's the top, like Trump said, of this globalist, George Herbert Walker Bush, CIA, most of them are actually CIA foundation people, they're not even FBI, that are at the top, and these are bad people.
[00:41:47.688 --> 00:41:49.229]  And they think they've broken your will.
[00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:50.911]  No!
[00:41:52.232 --> 00:41:56.615]  You will not break their will unless you commit 1 trillion percent.
[00:41:57.996 --> 00:41:58.877]  Squared to infinity.
[00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:07.524]  These are people that revel in the innocence and pain of children.
[00:42:07.944 --> 00:42:17.152]  I am more than honored to let them know that I challenge them on the field, I take them on the field, I will break them on the field.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.540]  I cannot lose.
[00:42:20.161 --> 00:42:23.682]  If I defeat them and survive and die at 92 years old, I win.
[00:42:24.082 --> 00:42:26.163]  If I am destroyed next week, I win.
[00:42:26.703 --> 00:42:29.864]  As long as my soul is pointed at God, I am victorious.
[00:42:29.884 --> 00:42:31.345]  And that's all I want you to understand.
[00:42:31.365 --> 00:42:34.686]  We're going to come back.
[00:42:35.206 --> 00:42:41.008]  I promise to get to all these clips, but Trump is now taking the gloves off and symbolically saying they don't have clearances.
[00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:42.069]  They're the enemy.
[00:42:44.036 --> 00:42:44.757]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:44.837 --> 00:42:46.840]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.602]  We're hated because of our spirit.
[00:42:49.343 --> 00:42:50.985]  We're hated because we don't live in fear.
[00:42:51.786 --> 00:42:53.648]  We're hated because we love God.
[00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.352]  These people are pathetic.
[00:42:56.392 --> 00:42:58.475]  They live in nothing but fear and insecurity.
[00:42:59.416 --> 00:43:00.157]  They fear the light.
[00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:00.858]  We love the light.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.641]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[00:43:07.441 --> 00:43:15.443]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[00:43:15.863 --> 00:43:24.866]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the President.
[00:43:25.726 --> 00:43:33.193]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[00:43:33.493 --> 00:43:36.976]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[00:43:37.456 --> 00:43:44.302]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[00:43:45.223 --> 00:43:54.993]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out the Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:59.157]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[00:43:59.777 --> 00:44:06.984]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[00:44:07.865 --> 00:44:25.101]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[00:44:25.842 --> 00:44:30.887]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[00:44:31.408 --> 00:44:37.434]  It's the Communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[00:44:37.735 --> 00:44:39.056]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:40.177]  They're the real traitors.
[00:44:40.618 --> 00:44:43.321]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen
[00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:46.545]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night.
[00:44:58.962 --> 00:44:59.102]  It's
[00:45:21.932 --> 00:45:26.794]  Who's a Wahhabist, who was an admitted communist in college, voted as a communist after he was in college.
[00:45:27.314 --> 00:45:32.656]  This anti-American piece of garbage has been caught illegally spying on the president back when he was in the campaign.
[00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:35.478]  Then once he was president-elect, he's been caught lying to Congress.
[00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:42.760]  This guy is saying that Trump is treasonous and that Trump needs to be politically paralyzed and removed.
[00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:43.821]  They want
[00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:51.014]  25th Amendment invoked and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[00:45:51.374 --> 00:45:53.336]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[00:45:53.776 --> 00:46:08.066]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the President and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the Republic.
[00:46:08.427 --> 00:46:09.888]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[00:46:09.908 --> 00:46:11.229]  So many great things are happening.
[00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:14.151]  We're making the nation great again and these traitors can't stand it.
[00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:17.474]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[00:46:17.934 --> 00:46:21.478]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[00:46:21.818 --> 00:46:29.786]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[00:46:29.906 --> 00:46:30.627]  Spread the article.
[00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:31.567]  Spread the videos.
[00:46:31.807 --> 00:46:36.291]  Subscribe to the new official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:53.944]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've backed InfoWars for more than 20 years and I want to thank you all.
[00:46:54.164 --> 00:46:59.786]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfoWarStore.com and support the InfoWar while getting great products.
[00:47:00.046 --> 00:47:00.887]  God bless you all.
[00:47:06.469 --> 00:47:09.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.449 --> 00:47:46.033]  So, I told you three years ago, when Trump was beginning his run, that this would be a move to expose the deep state and how they control people.
[00:47:46.554 --> 00:47:50.496]  Namely, money laundering, drug dealing, pedophilia, things like that.
[00:47:50.596 --> 00:47:53.637]  Classic corrupt intelligence agency type operations.
[00:47:53.897 --> 00:47:56.819]  It's not enough now to say some guy's cheating on his wife or vice versa to control him.
[00:47:57.399 --> 00:48:00.801]  You don't get in the club unless, you know, you're having sex with 15-year-old chicks.
[00:48:01.981 --> 00:48:03.162]  You know, young ladies.
[00:48:04.102 --> 00:48:05.383]  And then it just goes down from there.
[00:48:06.977 --> 00:48:08.198]  To killing two-year-olds.
[00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:11.562]  And so that's all coming out now.
[00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:14.444]  That's all coming out.
[00:48:15.305 --> 00:48:15.886]  And they're scared.
[00:48:16.166 --> 00:48:16.667]  And they should be.
[00:48:17.247 --> 00:48:20.330]  Because it's now a metaphysical death battle.
[00:48:21.592 --> 00:48:22.452]  Versus good and evil.
[00:48:24.194 --> 00:48:24.635]  Political.
[00:48:26.256 --> 00:48:26.637]  Cultural.
[00:48:27.998 --> 00:48:28.438]  To the death.
[00:48:28.498 --> 00:48:30.821]  The Democrats have said, we're going to fight with the Republicans to the death.
[00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:35.673]  That I write articles going, oh my god, the Democrats are saying they're going to kill all the Republicans.
[00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:38.554]  When they say, to the death, it means all the way to the end.
[00:48:38.655 --> 00:48:46.600]  But then they explain, in the Denver Post, in the LA Times, in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and everywhere else, they want to kidnap Trump's family.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.240]  They want to kill him.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.041]  They want to kill me.
[00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:49.081]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:49.341 --> 00:48:49.942]  Here's the headline.
[00:48:49.982 --> 00:48:51.203]  Infowars.com has it.
[00:48:51.723 --> 00:48:57.106]  Denver Post runs the letter, which means they selected it and agree with it, to the editor demanding Trump's execution.
[00:48:58.567 --> 00:49:00.669]  Meanwhile, I say politically is an allegory.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:06.775]  I will fight to the death to bring down Mueller at a high noon showdown like a western movie.
[00:49:06.795 --> 00:49:09.299]  And they go, oh, he wants to kill him.
[00:49:09.419 --> 00:49:10.220]  Oh, Jones wants violence.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.403]  Well, I'm all against violence, offensively.
[00:49:12.443 --> 00:49:13.144]  Everybody knows that.
[00:49:14.758 --> 00:49:18.342]  But Deep State launches a civil war and starts trying to hunt everybody down.
[00:49:18.403 --> 00:49:20.946]  Well, I don't think we're going to let them execute Order No.
[00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:22.408]  66 and just sit here flat-footed, are we?
[00:49:22.908 --> 00:49:28.575]  No, that's a whole other ball of wax, another kettle of fish, a whole other country in its entirety.
[00:49:28.996 --> 00:49:32.400]  A country that we know well that the enemy does not know well.
[00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:39.367]  The enemy just knows raping children on aircraft, and then, you know, setting and doing nasty things.
[00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:42.989]  They don't know the business of fighting.
[00:49:44.289 --> 00:49:47.911]  They know the business of sending men that'll fight, do their dirty work, under false pretenses.
[00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:49.352]  But that is coming to an end.
[00:49:49.612 --> 00:49:51.113]  That whole age is coming to an end.
[00:49:53.074 --> 00:49:58.217]  It's the battle of the gods, the Guta Dhammarong, if you look at it from one perspective.
[00:49:59.517 --> 00:50:00.198]  Okay, so.
[00:50:01.181 --> 00:50:04.043]  Trump is pointing out these are globalists, these are traitors.
[00:50:04.283 --> 00:50:06.505]  Oh, Clapper says, oh, let me keep my security clearance.
[00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:09.547]  Brennan says, let me keep my security clearance, but I don't even ever use it anymore.
[00:50:09.567 --> 00:50:10.328]  It's no big deal.
[00:50:10.368 --> 00:50:10.828]  Yeah, right.
[00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:23.037]  That's what lets you communicate with the people you put in power, like Reality Winner, the lady that hated white people, she was white, member of ISIS, the top secret security clearance, those type of folks.
[00:50:23.956 --> 00:50:27.117]  The mental patients that are trained like baby ducks imprinting on America hate.
[00:50:27.437 --> 00:50:32.560]  It's Rand Paul, the real patriot, who said, revoke their security clearances!
[00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:41.964]  A powerful alliance between Trump and Paul forming, ah, I told you a year and a half ago as we were working on that.
[00:50:41.984 --> 00:50:46.045]  And I know Matt Drudge was seminal on all that as well.
[00:50:47.006 --> 00:50:48.366]  Matt Drudge more seminal than us.
[00:50:49.047 --> 00:50:50.347]  Matt Drudge isn't on the internet.
[00:50:50.387 --> 00:50:51.568]  He's doing things behind the scenes.
[00:50:56.328 --> 00:50:57.749]  Never talking, just keeps walking.
[00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:04.752]  Now, continuing here, Deep State in uproar over security clearance review of Obama officials.
[00:51:04.792 --> 00:51:17.218]  They want to communicate and command with their stay-behind networks, their operatives, their embedded mutinous organizations, trying to sabotage the country as they become more desperate, as the nation comes back from the dead, now that the succubus has been removed from our neck.
[00:51:18.059 --> 00:51:24.862]  But first, before we go there, let's look at Clapper, former head of all the intelligence agencies,
[00:51:28.024 --> 00:51:31.587]  Office of National Intelligence telling Congress we've never spied on anyone in the U.S.
[00:51:32.027 --> 00:51:32.628]  even once.
[00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:39.773]  That's like saying the sun never went up or never set, or that fishies never swam in the ocean, or that mommy didn't love baby.
[00:51:42.035 --> 00:51:45.198]  Or that Obama isn't an Islamicist, American-hating mental patient.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.522]  So, here he is lying to Congress.
[00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:59.238]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:01.080]  No, sir.
[00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:03.102]  It does not?
[00:52:05.024 --> 00:52:05.865]  Not wittingly.
[00:52:07.246 --> 00:52:13.793]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:18.455]  I mean, hell, even under the warrants they do it to millions.
[00:52:18.955 --> 00:52:22.080]  Because you can have a warrant on one person and it scoops up like 10 million, they were saying.
[00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:24.004]  Okay, so that's a whopper of a lie.
[00:52:24.024 --> 00:52:25.626]  It's like saying bananas aren't yellow.
[00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:27.786]  School buses aren't yellow.
[00:52:27.806 --> 00:52:29.867]  I mean, the flag isn't red, white, and blue.
[00:52:29.927 --> 00:52:31.768]  I mean, Infowars isn't the tip of the spear.
[00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:33.068]  It's just, it's upside down world.
[00:52:33.928 --> 00:52:44.812]  So let's go ahead and go to him on CNN, which has no viewers, but is the communications surveillance command base of the Chi-Coms, the Islamicists, who openly pay for CNN, and the rest of it.
[00:52:44.852 --> 00:52:45.752]  Here's a clapper.
[00:52:46.392 --> 00:52:47.533]  He's got the clap all right.
[00:52:48.473 --> 00:52:51.434]  Fires back at Trump for revoking security clearances.
[00:52:52.273 --> 00:52:53.534]  I thought Trump was talking about it.
[00:52:53.594 --> 00:52:54.334]  He should revoke them.
[00:52:54.574 --> 00:52:55.474]  Didn't he just talk about it?
[00:52:56.295 --> 00:52:57.555]  CNN can't even get their headlines right.
[00:52:57.595 --> 00:52:57.935]  Here it is.
[00:52:58.656 --> 00:53:11.561]  I think it's off the top of my head it's kind of a sad commentary where for political reasons this is kind of a petty way of retribution I suppose for speaking out against
[00:53:12.935 --> 00:53:13.977]  Oh, you're so concerned.
[00:53:23.394 --> 00:53:35.498]  Sarah Sanders, one of the words she used, I'll just fill you in as you're getting this information, she referred to you guys all as politicizing, and that you've monetized, essentially monetized your security clearance by... That's enough of it, yeah.
[00:53:35.738 --> 00:53:43.661]  They're the Democrat cabal, Susan Rice, all of them, that illegally surveilled Trump, got caught doing it, and all the text messages, how much they hate Trump, it's all come out!
[00:53:44.662 --> 00:53:50.203]  You're the scum, you're the filth that the globalists found to try to sell the country out, and at the end you're getting your butts kicked, politically.
[00:53:50.844 --> 00:53:51.564]  And you don't like it.
[00:53:55.302 --> 00:53:56.662]  But man, you talk about lies.
[00:53:56.742 --> 00:53:57.963]  Just, just, just listen to that.
[00:53:58.803 --> 00:53:59.503]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:00.023 --> 00:54:04.944]  They communicate with their deep state operatives that still are in the government with the national security clearance.
[00:54:05.565 --> 00:54:09.886]  They talk to them now and give them orders or get classified info or leak it.
[00:54:09.966 --> 00:54:10.566]  It's a felony.
[00:54:11.486 --> 00:54:13.767]  Trump is doing this to stop them leaking.
[00:54:13.927 --> 00:54:14.547]  There's the headline.
[00:54:14.767 --> 00:54:19.268]  Trump is revoking security clearances of traders to stop the leaking.
[00:54:20.868 --> 00:54:21.288]  That's it!
[00:54:22.469 --> 00:54:23.289]  Should have done it earlier.
[00:54:24.275 --> 00:54:26.975]  But let me tell you, these sacks of crap aren't going to stop leaking.
[00:54:27.816 --> 00:54:31.756]  And you better believe they got surveillance up the yin-yang now, legally and lawfully.
[00:54:32.256 --> 00:54:33.957]  And so they're all getting set up right now.
[00:54:34.017 --> 00:54:35.317]  And they're too psycho to know it.
[00:54:35.757 --> 00:54:37.817]  You always run into these weird egomaniacs.
[00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:39.718]  They have this fake confidence, but there's nothing behind it.
[00:54:41.518 --> 00:54:42.618]  They never built anything themselves.
[00:54:42.638 --> 00:54:44.319]  They were just hired by traitors to be traitors.
[00:54:45.239 --> 00:54:48.319]  And then you're like, dude, you're about to get your ass handed to you.
[00:54:48.859 --> 00:54:52.240]  And then as soon as the fight starts politically, they start begging for mama.
[00:54:53.814 --> 00:54:55.394]  When their head meets the political concrete.
[00:54:59.696 --> 00:54:59.956]  Sorry.
[00:55:00.836 --> 00:55:01.856]  Here's Wolf Blitzer.
[00:55:01.896 --> 00:55:04.177]  Everybody knows I'm pro-Israel.
[00:55:05.437 --> 00:55:07.198]  I think Netanyahu is a lot better than the other folks over there.
[00:55:07.238 --> 00:55:08.478]  I think they have a right to be over there.
[00:55:08.498 --> 00:55:10.479]  Because every time I say this, they say I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:15.000]  I say George Soros hates Jews and shipped him off to death camps and in the WikiLeaks wants to overthrow Israel.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:19.421]  The New York Times last week said, I hate Israel because I'm anti-Semitic because I don't like George Soros.
[00:55:19.761 --> 00:55:20.822]  I don't like a Nazi Jew.
[00:55:22.442 --> 00:55:22.762]  Whatever.
[00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:26.245]  But I point out that, I mean, Will Blitzer worked for the Israeli government.
[00:55:26.445 --> 00:55:29.006]  He was in Shin Bet and Mossad.
[00:55:29.627 --> 00:55:31.448]  And he's a high-level intelligence operative of Israel.
[00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:35.811]  The word is he now obviously works for the Ford Foundation, the CIA, and the leftist arm.
[00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:40.113]  But the point is, look, dude, you don't need to be running U.S.
[00:55:40.153 --> 00:55:40.454]  media.
[00:55:40.654 --> 00:55:44.536]  Just like we don't need some CIA dude over there, you know, in Israel being their main anchor.
[00:55:45.834 --> 00:55:47.395]  You're an American or you're not, Blitzer.
[00:55:47.975 --> 00:55:48.375]  It's simple.
[00:55:48.775 --> 00:55:53.437]  And I'm not against Israel, but Israel should not be involved in our internal politics.
[00:55:53.457 --> 00:55:55.158]  And we shouldn't be involved in Israel's, by the way.
[00:55:55.658 --> 00:55:56.259]  Just like Trump said.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.741]  Don't want to turn it over to the Palestinians to burn it all down in one day?
[00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:02.982]  No.
[00:56:03.462 --> 00:56:04.122]  Don't want a peace deal?
[00:56:04.142 --> 00:56:04.362]  Yes.
[00:56:04.382 --> 00:56:05.583]  Am I against all the Muslims?
[00:56:05.643 --> 00:56:05.803]  No.
[00:56:06.183 --> 00:56:07.704]  But the Muslims are run by the globalists.
[00:56:07.724 --> 00:56:08.304]  It's all on record.
[00:56:08.344 --> 00:56:09.064]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[00:56:09.624 --> 00:56:10.225]  Let's go to...
[00:56:12.059 --> 00:56:18.042]  Wolf Blitzer, the Shin Bet, he's a double intelligence, Shin Bet Mossad operative.
[00:56:18.122 --> 00:56:24.325]  By the way, if you read deeply, when Shin was founded in 1980, they hired him because he'd be a Middle East analyst.
[00:56:24.365 --> 00:56:26.826]  I mean, he is an Israeli intelligence officer.
[00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:27.186]  Here it is.
[00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:35.550]  You remove security clearances from a James Clapper, for example, and you say, you know what, we're not going to bother talking to that person anymore.
[00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:37.871]  That's a potential national security threat.
[00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:40.733]  So there you go.
[00:56:40.813 --> 00:56:41.834]  National security threat.
[00:56:41.854 --> 00:56:42.335]  Yeah, right.
[00:56:43.435 --> 00:56:44.356]  Let's play another club here.
[00:56:44.676 --> 00:56:46.878]  Let's go to ABC's Terry Moran.
[00:56:47.879 --> 00:56:48.940]  Spars with Sarah Sanders.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.240]  Here it is.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:57:10.293]  The President is exploring these mechanisms to remove security clearance because they politicize and in some cases actually monetize their public service and their security clearances and making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the President is extremely inappropriate.
[00:57:10.613 --> 00:57:15.096]  The President contends to the fact that people with security clearances are making these baseless charges.
[00:57:15.436 --> 00:57:31.182]  So what they're doing is, they're using their security clearance to get classified info, then spin it to try to kill peace deals in Korea, Middle East, you name it.
[00:57:31.242 --> 00:57:32.782]  I mean, these are saboteurs.
[00:57:33.303 --> 00:57:36.264]  So Trump would be involved in dereliction of duty if he didn't do this.
[00:57:36.584 --> 00:57:37.664]  This is a good first start.
[00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:39.825]  Now you know these crooks aren't going to stop.
[00:57:40.365 --> 00:57:40.885]  It's all happening.
[00:57:40.965 --> 00:57:42.446]  Trump is a nationalist.
[00:57:43.046 --> 00:57:44.046]  The country's coming back.
[00:58:00.114 --> 00:58:08.360]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him through a military coup, or through the 25th Amendment.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.440]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.801]  It's all happening right now.
[00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:20.768]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[00:58:21.448 --> 00:58:29.574]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[00:58:30.254 --> 00:58:30.875]  They're the traitors.
[00:58:31.636 --> 00:58:33.638]  They may be successful removing our president.
[00:58:33.979 --> 00:58:36.341]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:36.822 --> 00:58:41.688]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[00:58:41.948 --> 00:58:44.411]  We are in the middle of the second American Revolution.
[00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:47.475]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[00:58:47.915 --> 00:58:52.020]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.262]  We just keep boosting the sales.

[00:59:32.596 --> 00:59:32.957]  All of it.
[00:59:32.977 --> 00:59:34.837]  We're coming through the storm thanks to you.

[00:59:41.581 --> 00:59:43.822]  This is the battle for the future.
[00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:45.302]  This is the war for the future.
[00:59:45.663 --> 00:59:49.144]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[00:59:49.464 --> 00:59:49.784]  Thank you.
[00:59:50.125 --> 00:59:50.705]  I'm counting on you.
[00:59:51.025 --> 00:59:51.486]  I salute you.
[00:59:56.936 --> 01:00:00.843]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:19.548 --> 01:00:27.131]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.151 --> 01:00:31.272]  All right, I'm going to air a breakdown of a previous report I did.
[01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:33.493]  We're going to come back and get into all the news I haven't hit yet.
[01:00:33.513 --> 01:00:36.494]  And we're going to open the phones up about the balance of the broadcast today.
[01:00:36.855 --> 01:00:38.575]  So get ready for me to give the number out in the next segment.
[01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:39.696]  I want to talk to all of you.
[01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.877]  But there's so much to get to coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:43.752 --> 01:00:45.133]  I wanted to get to this boil down.
[01:00:45.733 --> 01:00:48.655]  Social media Godzilla vaporizing the Constitution.
[01:00:48.675 --> 01:00:50.396]  It's a really critical report.
[01:00:50.476 --> 01:00:51.136]  It's coming up.
[01:00:51.837 --> 01:00:55.159]  There's a lot of key stories breaking at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:00:55.179 --> 01:00:56.600]  We'll break it all down the other side of the break.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.120]  But here is this report.
[01:00:58.681 --> 01:01:01.943]  Trump derangement syndrome has reached new peaks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:02.063 --> 01:01:05.285]  It has even hit the likes of Google.
[01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.952]  Alex Jones breaks it down.
[01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:16.835]  Google is using its worldwide monopoly power of 93% of all searches to engage in fraud.
[01:01:18.236 --> 01:01:26.459]  Worldwide searches for the term idiot return the top results for Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States.
[01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:33.662]  Remember just a month ago, ahead of primary elections in California?
[01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:38.616]  The top search term for Republican candidates was Nazi.
[01:01:39.156 --> 01:01:50.098]  And Google officially, at the top of their page, under politics, had a voter guide section that said, the ideology of Republicans is Nazism.
[01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:52.138]  And it goes on and on from there.
[01:01:52.578 --> 01:02:04.360]  President Trump is essentially shadow banned on Twitter right now, as are almost all the conservatives or nationalists, where you have to go directly to his page or be directly following him
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:12.924]  Meanwhile, the left is calling for violence, attacking people on a daily basis for wearing Make America Great Again hats.
[01:02:13.905 --> 01:02:15.746]  We're seeing all these calls to kill the president.
[01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:31.057]  This is a soft civil war taking place by multinational corporations and communist China that now owns Hollywood, that is pumping out nothing but pure anti-American, anti-free market, anti-Trump, anti-infowars garbage.
[01:02:31.657 --> 01:02:35.640]  The president must move for antitrust hearings against Google.
[01:02:39.663 --> 01:02:47.550]  We as a people must not let the internet infrastructure we built be hijacked by world government backed up by Communist China.
[01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:54.476]  Think about how arrogant they are to have the executives of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as subsidiary.
[01:02:55.417 --> 01:03:00.684]  In Congress on Tuesday, claiming that they don't censor anybody unless they call for violence.
[01:03:01.485 --> 01:03:03.046]  It's total garbage.
[01:03:03.587 --> 01:03:07.732]  Myself, Paul Watson, Ben Shapiro now starting to be censored.
[01:03:07.752 --> 01:03:11.316]  At first he was all for me being censored, but now he's freaking out.
[01:03:12.237 --> 01:03:14.518]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're going after everybody.
[01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:15.678]  They're making their move.
[01:03:16.158 --> 01:03:17.939]  We're only a couple months out from the midterms.
[01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:20.060]  This is a big campaign issue.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.821]  Trump needs to make it a big campaign issue instead of being flat-footed.
[01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.762]  Because the Congress is sitting on its butt.
[01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:35.205]  You watch these hearings, the Republicans get circles run around them by these executives that are lying under oath, and it's disgusting.
[01:03:35.825 --> 01:03:36.766]  We know what they're doing.
[01:03:37.826 --> 01:03:41.107]  There's a big zero-hedge article on Infowars.com that lays it all out.
[01:03:41.808 --> 01:03:45.249]  The tracker systems that can show you how you're shadow banned, what's happening.
[01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.170]  People need to get informed on this.
[01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.130]  They need to get aggressive.
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.210]  They need to take action.
[01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:51.491]  Google is a broken search engine.
[01:03:52.492 --> 01:04:00.274]  There was a big scandal when they protected Hillary Clinton back during the campaign and would put nothing but positive search results up for her and would bury stuff against her.
[01:04:00.655 --> 01:04:02.455]  And CNN gave her the questions ahead of time.
[01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:04.416]  But with all that rigging, they still failed.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.843]  This time, the amount of censorship and rigging is 50 times what it was.
[01:04:09.863 --> 01:04:12.144]  I mean, it's just, it's a whole other universe.
[01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:18.768]  And people need to take action because we've just gotten conditioned to accept this censorship as part of what they do.
[01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:24.172]  No, it's criminal, it's racketeering, it's discriminatory, and it's out of control.
[01:04:25.052 --> 01:04:37.404]  We have Google set up by the CIA on record in Qatel, a part of the infrastructure of this country, handed over to private companies who made hundreds of billions of dollars off the American taxpayer that helped pay for it.
[01:04:37.644 --> 01:04:40.887]  And our infrastructure, Google is NSA infrastructure.
[01:04:41.407 --> 01:04:45.911]  And then now that deep state apparatus is being used in war against the people.
[01:04:46.432 --> 01:04:48.474]  It couldn't get more obvious.
[01:04:51.607 --> 01:04:53.651]  Next year's news today, InfoWars.
[01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:56.275]  We'll be back live in T-minus 60 seconds.
[01:04:56.375 --> 01:05:01.304]  Please spread all the live links and tell folks about local stations you're listening to, or the Globeless will win.
[01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:09.462]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[01:05:10.103 --> 01:05:15.264]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:22.286]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:26.207]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[01:05:26.947 --> 01:05:30.648]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:32.348]  And my only message is this.
[01:05:32.608 --> 01:05:35.669]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[01:05:36.509 --> 01:05:43.991]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[01:05:44.511 --> 01:05:47.352]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[01:05:47.372 --> 01:05:48.292]  We already have the power.
[01:05:48.532 --> 01:05:53.433]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:56.715]  InfoWars is on the front line and so are you.
[01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:58.256]  We are the resistance!
[01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:18.517]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:19.257 --> 01:06:20.717]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.138]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:22.658 --> 01:06:27.380]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:36.063]  Well, the Hollywood Reporter and many others are reporting.
[01:06:36.303 --> 01:06:37.944]  There's a link up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:06:38.524 --> 01:06:40.145]  There's a link up on InfoWars.com.
[01:06:41.104 --> 01:06:55.768]  That all the big Hollywood stars in the whole Luciferian heaven are wanting Gunn, the director that sent out hundreds of tweets praising raping babies, raping little girls, how great pedophilia is.
[01:06:56.228 --> 01:07:01.749]  All these other actors and directors came to his defense, turned out their Twitter pages, praised pedophilia.
[01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:05.730]  They did skits of raping one-year-old babies as they begged for mercy.
[01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.731]  Isn't that the subway guy that got convicted of pedophilia?
[01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:09.831]  I mean, is it like a clone?
[01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:14.768]  Is this like an alien invasion of weird child raping clones?
[01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:16.049]  Don't run.
[01:07:16.089 --> 01:07:16.950]  We want your children.
[01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:18.232]  Your children belong to us.
[01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:21.335]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic for the media runs with that and is serious.
[01:07:21.355 --> 01:07:22.536]  We're going to be looking at that.
[01:07:23.057 --> 01:07:25.179]  We're going to be covering so many other issues.
[01:07:25.219 --> 01:07:30.405]  But what do you think about Trump moving to pull the national security clearances of the CLAP?
[01:07:31.675 --> 01:07:34.918]  And Brennan and all these other people that ran the illegal spying on him.
[01:07:34.938 --> 01:07:35.838]  They've been caught lying.
[01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.220]  I think it's a really important issue to cover.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.763]  Also, there was an article about this on Infowars.com yesterday.
[01:07:41.783 --> 01:07:44.064]  And there was a big buzz about it.
[01:07:45.025 --> 01:07:47.607]  Drudge was linked to the NBC report itself.
[01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:49.468]  We'll be covering this later in the hour.
[01:07:49.488 --> 01:07:55.433]  NBC promotes parents who refuse to assign gender to their three-year-old twins.
[01:07:56.834 --> 01:07:57.774]  And I was talking to my wife.
[01:07:57.814 --> 01:08:00.016]  She has a friend she went to college with in Seattle.
[01:08:04.158 --> 01:08:11.160]  She went to Washington State, who makes her kids wear gray uniforms, and then messes with them about their gender.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:23.603]  I mean, in my view, this is just child abuse by really weirdos that buy into whatever the latest fad is of the Tavistock Institute to break down society and screw their children up.
[01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:26.163]  I mean, it's admitted ugly architecture, ugly art.
[01:08:26.843 --> 01:08:28.884]  The breakdown of the family is a MI6.
[01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:33.712]  CIA Foundation Program for Depopulation.
[01:08:34.272 --> 01:08:43.521]  My film Endgame 2.0, an internet-only video I put out, like, nine years ago, with several professors that were researching all this.
[01:08:45.503 --> 01:08:46.043]  Get into it.
[01:08:46.063 --> 01:08:52.009]  And if you call somebody a boy or girl, or if you buy pink clothes for your girl, or blue clothes for your boy, you're a bad person.
[01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:55.152]  And then you go to Target, and they've gotten rid of the girls and boys sections.
[01:08:56.021 --> 01:08:56.562]  In many areas.
[01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:58.367]  So gender neutral preschool.
[01:08:58.387 --> 01:09:03.299]  This is sexualization of children by telling them that they're not a gender.
[01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.063]  This is such abuse.
[01:09:07.168 --> 01:09:09.889]  As Camille Pagli and many others have pointed out, it's just incredible.
[01:09:09.909 --> 01:09:10.590]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:16.193]  Also, turns out, of course, every time there's another shooting in the U.S.
[01:09:16.253 --> 01:09:17.913]  or Canada or the U.K.
[01:09:18.013 --> 01:09:20.915]  or Germany, there's one every week, somebody's screaming, Allah Akbar.
[01:09:20.935 --> 01:09:23.716]  They go, well, they were just mentally ill, screaming, Allah Akbar.
[01:09:24.437 --> 01:09:27.978]  But it turns out the gentleman that shot a bunch of people and killed
[01:09:29.735 --> 01:09:35.998]  A couple folks, 10-year-old and 18-year-old woman and injuring 13 others, went out to a Christian-Greek meeting.
[01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:40.321]  Turns out he was named Faisal Hussein.
[01:09:42.202 --> 01:09:46.044]  So, isn't that just precious as usual?
[01:09:46.544 --> 01:09:50.607]  Also, Russia's new nuclear weapon able to wipe out an area the size of Texas or France.
[01:09:51.107 --> 01:09:52.187]  More on what the U.S.
[01:09:52.227 --> 01:09:53.408]  calls the Satan Missile.
[01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:54.589]  We'll be looking at that.
[01:09:55.666 --> 01:09:59.349]  But we shouldn't talk to Russia, according to the Democrats, that they can talk to Russia, but you can't.
[01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:04.212]  Denver Post runs a letter to the editor demanding Trump execution.
[01:10:06.273 --> 01:10:12.858]  Trump's lawyers have allowed the government to get a hold of the bombshell Michael Cohen tapes because they say they've listened to them, they're all exonerating.
[01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:13.478]  There's nothing there.
[01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:16.941]  Judge grants immunity for five witnesses in Manafort case.
[01:10:17.761 --> 01:10:23.746]  We told you that last... Not this last Sunday, but Sunday before last, so that's...
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.302]  Nine days before it's in CNN.
[01:10:27.862 --> 01:10:28.583]  That's why they hate us.
[01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:30.464]  So there's all that news.
[01:10:31.385 --> 01:10:34.108]  Venezuela's inflation to reach 1 million percent.
[01:10:35.849 --> 01:10:36.770]  IMF forecast.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.412]  Wow, that's, that's, that communism is really great.
[01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:44.157]  And, and, and, and, and, and I call her Congresswoman.
[01:10:45.973 --> 01:10:46.754]  That's how my brain works.
[01:10:46.814 --> 01:10:48.316]  I just jump to what I know is going to happen.
[01:10:48.816 --> 01:11:03.472]  I mean, things might change, but right now I'm not going to say about a 90% chance that Congresswoman Cortez, I keep calling her Congresswoman because it's like a 90% Democrat district there in New York City.
[01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:06.155]  So nobody thinks the Republicans are going to win.
[01:11:07.412 --> 01:11:10.754]  She likes Venezuela, and she wants the exact same policies that did that.
[01:11:10.774 --> 01:11:15.016]  And people go, oh, but we've got 1% that has 70% of the wealth, or 65%.
[01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:25.762]  Well, that's because technically, the way taxes work, I own all this equipment, and buildings, and things.
[01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:30.285]  And so you could technically, the way the IRS says it, say that I have $4 million worth of equipment.
[01:11:30.805 --> 01:11:31.906]  Truth is, I could probably sell it for $800,000.
[01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:35.048]  We had it actually appraised last year.
[01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:38.399]  So I'm not really worth $4 million.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.863]  But the IRS says just my equipment in here is $4 million.
[01:11:43.063 --> 01:11:46.546]  And I've got to like amortize it out, accrue it, and pay for it.
[01:11:46.987 --> 01:11:53.073]  So when I buy a piece of equipment because it's just with a company set up, then I'm paying taxes on that.
[01:11:53.113 --> 01:11:54.354]  So it's the same thing.
[01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:59.479]  Like you hear about somebody who, oh, you know, Bezos is worth $155 billion because of his stock.
[01:12:02.312 --> 01:12:03.493]  Well, that stock's highly inflated.
[01:12:04.013 --> 01:12:05.354]  But Bezos is a globalist.
[01:12:05.394 --> 01:12:06.255]  He doesn't want wealth.
[01:12:06.295 --> 01:12:07.976]  He doesn't want prosperity for you.
[01:12:08.036 --> 01:12:09.297]  He wants to lift the ladder up.
[01:12:10.137 --> 01:12:11.298]  They want an austere system.
[01:12:11.338 --> 01:12:16.401]  Obama goes around and gives speeches in South America and Africa and Asia, saying, you gotta be poor, it's for the earth, get used to it.
[01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:22.045]  So, people look at capitalism and they go, oh, well, it's got problems too.
[01:12:22.445 --> 01:12:23.826]  Well, of course it's got problems.
[01:12:25.127 --> 01:12:29.410]  Just the trickle down from it gives us all the science, technology, free will choices.
[01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:37.881]  But the point I'm getting at is, you'll hear somebody's net worth is, you know, $100 billion.
[01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:44.484]  That's all the infrastructure and the buildings they own and everything leveraged up on the stock market.
[01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:49.606]  And if you got down to their liquid assets, you know, it might be, if you're worth $100 billion, it might be $10 billion.
[01:12:50.487 --> 01:12:51.347]  But that's not even the issue.
[01:12:51.387 --> 01:12:52.508]  It's not a class envy thing.
[01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:57.650]  Those rich guys know that you're involved in class envy, that everybody is, that they've manipulated it.
[01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:03.536]  So people think if somebody's got a million-dollar house and a nice car, you know, they're ultra-rich and they stole it somehow.
[01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:08.641]  That's the type of person you want that actually gets services and actually builds companies and does things.
[01:13:09.402 --> 01:13:12.665]  It's the ultra-rich who are .0000000042 last time we did the numbers.
[01:13:17.076 --> 01:13:21.798]  Who actually have about 80% of the wealth in that top 1%.
[01:13:22.438 --> 01:13:31.001]  So if you've got 65 to 70% of the wealth being 1%, but almost all of that wealth is in the point way out there.
[01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:32.662]  It's like 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
[01:13:33.822 --> 01:13:34.942]  It's 8 or 9 zeros, then 4, 2.
[01:13:35.222 --> 01:13:38.404]  That's just the back of the envelope deal.
[01:13:38.444 --> 01:13:40.244]  So it's actually a 0.0000 group that has
[01:13:43.826 --> 01:13:46.289]  Well over 55%, 60% of the wealth.
[01:13:46.769 --> 01:13:55.760]  And then you've got the other 1% that's got maybe 10, 15% of that maybe, and then they're the ones that actually build stuff and buy things and, you know, actually everybody then lives off of.
[01:13:57.261 --> 01:14:01.906]  And that's how that works, is there's going to be people that own things, that do things, that innovate things, that have things.
[01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:03.909]  But just because you own an apartment building,
[01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:07.273]  And then people live in that and everything.
[01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:09.714]  It doesn't mean like, oh, look, he owns that.
[01:14:09.794 --> 01:14:12.016]  He owns you because you live in an apartment building.
[01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:13.236]  It's all part of the infrastructure.
[01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.058]  It's not like, well, what about their wealth?
[01:14:15.138 --> 01:14:17.219]  It's the value of all the stuff they've got.
[01:14:17.439 --> 01:14:26.645]  But most of what they've got is infrastructure, ships carrying goods, satellites with communication, farms and food and trucks delivering it and all this stuff.
[01:14:28.446 --> 01:14:33.389]  But under a true free market system, which we'll never approach purely because things are always somewhat crony,
[01:14:34.684 --> 01:14:42.062]  But moving towards a renaissance economy and a conquest economy, things just exponentially get cheaper, there's more of everything.
[01:14:42.363 --> 01:14:42.964]  It's unlimited!
[01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:45.927]  The problem is decadence comes with that.
[01:14:46.867 --> 01:15:04.115]  So the globalists have decided to get control of things and try to keep you at a very low level so you never get too ambitious, you never get too uppity in their terms, so they can keep you at a, you know, $10,000 a year on welfare and just in a horrible ghetto, no man in the house, totally controlled, your kids, you know, fuel the prison industry.
[01:15:05.137 --> 01:15:08.099]  And then you can point at that and say, look at capitalism, it sucks.
[01:15:08.519 --> 01:15:15.963]  We've never even attained 10% capitalism and look a little bit of it just like, like, whoa, humans can do anything.
[01:15:16.403 --> 01:15:22.746]  But socialism and communism creates total nightmare centralizations with crazy people running everything.
[01:15:24.647 --> 01:15:26.428]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:15:26.508 --> 01:15:28.870]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.210]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:31.151]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:33.453 --> 01:15:35.354]  Oh, and I'm going to give the number out.
[01:15:35.594 --> 01:15:38.915]  It's always important to give the number out.
[01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:39.655]  I forgot to do that.
[01:15:40.795 --> 01:15:50.178]  The number for first-time callers in this hour, everybody can call in the third hour, is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:50.198 --> 01:15:51.418]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:51.498 --> 01:15:52.459]  We are the hated.
[01:15:52.539 --> 01:15:53.399]  We are the vaunted.
[01:15:53.779 --> 01:15:55.960]  We are the deplorables.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.980]  We are the people that the globalists hate.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.741]  Because we believe in humanity, and we are going to destroy them.
[01:16:02.751 --> 01:16:13.696]  Any student of military history, in all of recorded time, will tell you that stealth and sneak attack is absolutely critical in any offensive war.
[01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:18.818]  The Democrats, the CHICOM's funding them, Hollywood,
[01:16:19.824 --> 01:16:31.973]  The whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[01:16:32.733 --> 01:16:33.674]  NATO is their army.
[01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:37.477]  Right now, the Democrats are making their move.
[01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:47.266]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the president using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[01:16:47.786 --> 01:16:55.653]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[01:16:55.953 --> 01:17:00.656]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:14.362]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[01:17:14.782 --> 01:17:25.827]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:29.629]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[01:17:30.049 --> 01:17:35.373]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:37.655]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[01:17:37.975 --> 01:17:42.298]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:46.000]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.783]  But you could see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[01:17:50.283 --> 01:17:52.486]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[01:17:52.526 --> 01:17:54.167]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:55.589]  The economy's turning around.
[01:17:55.969 --> 01:18:02.116]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:05.280]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.901]  All the things Trump's killed.
[01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:14.766]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[01:18:15.006 --> 01:18:16.567]  He's acting as our real president.
[01:18:16.908 --> 01:18:19.489]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:19.769 --> 01:18:21.030]  He really is the president now.
[01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:28.535]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood, thought they had this country.
[01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:34.099]  The communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[01:18:34.379 --> 01:18:35.180]  They're the big threat.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.082]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[01:18:38.362 --> 01:18:40.683]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:45.947]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[01:18:46.427 --> 01:18:48.568]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:52.131]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[01:18:52.751 --> 01:18:59.739]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk before they finally make their move.
[01:19:00.119 --> 01:19:05.685]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[01:19:05.725 --> 01:19:07.367]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[01:19:07.668 --> 01:19:08.649]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:19:09.009 --> 01:19:09.930]  They are the globalists.
[01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.591]  They are the enemy.
[01:19:10.811 --> 01:19:25.680]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:34.566]  This is a war against America, trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[01:19:35.006 --> 01:19:35.646]  We're good to go.
[01:20:06.863 --> 01:20:09.625]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.965 --> 01:20:34.600]  We walk the streets at night.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.301]  We go where eagles dare.
[01:20:38.441 --> 01:20:39.601]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:44.543]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the sites they hope you don't visit.
[01:20:45.063 --> 01:20:46.244]  And I'm going to go over some of those stories.
[01:20:46.304 --> 01:20:54.226]  Next segment is your calls on any big issue, as long as you're a first-time caller, on what do you think of them trying to pull the security clearances of these global traders.
[01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:54.987]  I say right on.
[01:20:55.427 --> 01:20:57.808]  What do you make of the escalating situation in Syria?
[01:20:58.728 --> 01:20:59.749]  So many other big issues.
[01:20:59.769 --> 01:21:03.030]  We're going to be getting into Venezuela, inflation to reach 1 million percent.
[01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:05.351]  IMF forecast, what a heavenly place.
[01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:08.632]  Network coverage of Trump immigration policy, 92 percent.
[01:21:09.112 --> 01:21:10.593]  Negative Washington Times reports.
[01:21:11.773 --> 01:21:12.774]  It's all coming up.
[01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:20.042]  But first, I want to go back, because Hillary Clinton and her foundation has a couple billion dollars in it.
[01:21:20.302 --> 01:21:21.443]  Democratic Party's bankrupt.
[01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:25.326]  They're having the worst fundraising of their modern existence.
[01:21:26.027 --> 01:21:37.217]  They've got lots of people in mainstream newspapers that told you Trump would lose, are saying there's going to be a big blue wave, and oh, top expert says, you know, in the Hill, that there's going to be a big blue wave victory.
[01:21:38.004 --> 01:21:40.546]  The same old newspaper says that I said I want to shoot Mueller.
[01:21:40.686 --> 01:21:41.246]  Never said that.
[01:21:42.026 --> 01:21:46.609]  I said, metaphysically, politically, it's high noon, political shootout, and we're going to win.
[01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:48.310]  Or we're going to die trying.
[01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:55.815]  It doesn't mean like, again, Red River shootout, UT, Oklahoma, Red River shootout, and people are up at Dallas shooting each other.
[01:21:58.208 --> 01:21:59.489]  That's how desperate they are.
[01:22:00.409 --> 01:22:04.270]  So we'll be discussing it all coming up at 877-789-2539.
[01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.391]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:22:07.151 --> 01:22:16.335]  But I wanted to go back because Snopes, run by George Soros and others, says that Brennan was never in the Communist Party, didn't vote Communist, even though he told New Yorker Magazine he did.
[01:22:17.995 --> 01:22:22.357]  And they say that, you know, Trump says that Mexicans are all criminals and rapists.
[01:22:22.377 --> 01:22:24.998]  Now he said we have a lot of criminals coming across who aren't vetted.
[01:22:25.638 --> 01:22:26.979]  People like, you know, rapists and criminals.
[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:28.770]  It's all games.
[01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:32.371]  But they set themselves up like, here's the highest thing in the universe.
[01:22:32.971 --> 01:22:35.412]  It's not Infowars, it's not Drudge, it's not even the New York Times.
[01:22:35.852 --> 01:22:36.092]  It's Snopes!
[01:22:36.112 --> 01:22:53.137]  It's aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[01:22:55.799 --> 01:22:56.359]  That's what they're doing.
[01:22:56.459 --> 01:23:07.843]  But then, I decided, just last week when Hillary said, oh I'm so tired I can hardly stand up, to kind of go get a compilation of clips of her saying she can't walk, she's tired.
[01:23:08.243 --> 01:23:15.545]  And then I found some I didn't even know about, from 2012 with her falling down, and all her people jump up and block all the cameras.
[01:23:15.805 --> 01:23:18.806]  Like they were already drilling then that she was collapsing in advance.
[01:23:18.886 --> 01:23:20.326]  So, it was worse than I thought.
[01:23:20.807 --> 01:23:21.907]  Here's the latest compilation.
[01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:24.774]  Now we have to keep it going.
[01:23:24.974 --> 01:23:26.154]  We cannot stop.
[01:23:26.314 --> 01:23:29.195]  And we have to be supporting each other.
[01:23:29.215 --> 01:23:35.516]  You know, it's kind of exhausting to be part of protesting and marching and demonstrating.
[01:23:35.536 --> 01:23:37.357]  Oh, she cares about women.
[01:23:38.737 --> 01:23:45.779]  I've been back there listening to Randy and I'm so exhausted I can barely stand here.
[01:23:45.799 --> 01:23:46.860]  She looks like she's dying.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.180]  There she is, falling down.
[01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:52.001]  This is who we're ruled by.
[01:23:52.993 --> 01:23:54.214]  She tells us we're bad.
[01:23:54.234 --> 01:23:55.475]  She uses guilt to control us.
[01:23:55.515 --> 01:23:57.277]  And we bow and say, what do we do?
[01:23:57.297 --> 01:23:58.317]  She won't call us names.
[01:23:58.938 --> 01:24:01.660]  Oh, the lady that represents dictators and pedophiles and everybody.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.020]  Oh.
[01:24:02.721 --> 01:24:03.902]  Oh, tell us about Epstein.
[01:24:03.922 --> 01:24:05.003]  Oh, tell us about Mueller.
[01:24:05.283 --> 01:24:05.403]  Oh.
[01:24:06.344 --> 01:24:07.004]  Tell us, Mueller.
[01:24:07.024 --> 01:24:07.885]  Oh, you're so scary.
[01:24:08.265 --> 01:24:10.627]  You ran hidden cameras on the airplane while they rape little kids.
[01:24:10.687 --> 01:24:11.608]  Oh, you're so scary.
[01:24:11.828 --> 01:24:12.589]  You help rape kids.
[01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:13.589]  Oh, Mueller, we're so scared.
[01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:14.030]  No!
[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.532]  I'm scared of not going after you, and I am going to do it.
[01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.588]  So I found a compilation that's pretty powerful online.
[01:24:20.628 --> 01:24:23.570]  I want to plug the YouTube channel here as well.
[01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:27.131]  Irrefutable proof Hillary Clinton has a seizure disorder.
[01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:28.572]  William Ramsey.
[01:24:29.492 --> 01:24:31.733]  And this is stuff I didn't even know about from C-SPAN.
[01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:36.856]  If you're a radio listener, when she's falling down in 2011, 2012 and stuff, she's got a bunch of stuff.
[01:24:36.876 --> 01:24:37.676]  I never even saw this.
[01:24:40.197 --> 01:24:45.619]  There are people like just like stand up like body snatchers and all like get real aggressive and start grabbing the cameras.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.460]  So this is
[01:24:48.097 --> 01:24:49.877]  This is like seven years ago.
[01:24:49.897 --> 01:24:51.038]  Well, here it is.
[01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:56.519]  This is a video of Hillary Clinton fainting in 2012, where she suffered a concussion.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:08.281]  The minute she falls down, all the Democrats get up like zombies and turn the camera off.
[01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:10.181]  This happened to our reporters, too, in Austin.
[01:25:10.962 --> 01:25:12.402]  It's like they're all trained.
[01:25:13.846 --> 01:25:14.526]  Is there a god?
[01:25:14.566 --> 01:25:21.308]  It's like, has all these brain tumors and it's like... Like, she's our goddess, prop her up!
[01:25:22.588 --> 01:25:26.449]  She came, she saw, countries died, Africa died, she's our blood witch.
[01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:31.090]  From July 22nd, 26th, where she has an involuntary pedigmal seizure.
[01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:38.631]  It was a wonderful, meaningful endorsement in every way, and I was very proud of it.
[01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:44.742]  She's learning how to make it a big joke.
[01:25:44.762 --> 01:25:46.742]  You guys have got to try the cold chai.
[01:25:47.202 --> 01:25:50.583]  It is delicious, isn't it?
[01:25:50.823 --> 01:25:53.004]  She actually distracted, got to try the cold chai.
[01:25:53.544 --> 01:25:54.524]  Seriously trained evil.
[01:25:54.784 --> 01:25:55.804]  Like, I'm having a convulsion.
[01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:56.804]  Try the cold chai.
[01:25:59.245 --> 01:26:02.726]  They're like, you ship the weapons to Turkey out of Benghazi.
[01:26:02.826 --> 01:26:03.246]  Turkey?
[01:26:03.286 --> 01:26:04.386]  I don't even eat turkeys.
[01:26:04.406 --> 01:26:05.366]  They're like, Thanksgiving?
[01:26:06.867 --> 01:26:07.467]  Let's go back to it.
[01:26:13.516 --> 01:26:14.757]  This is the traitor they've got.
[01:26:14.797 --> 01:26:16.899]  You guys have got to try the cold chai.
[01:26:17.199 --> 01:26:18.940]  This is where evil takes you?
[01:26:19.861 --> 01:26:20.461]  Look at these women.
[01:26:20.662 --> 01:26:22.303]  They're all like, look mentally ill.
[01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.384]  They're all groveling.
[01:26:23.584 --> 01:26:24.384]  They all hate men.
[01:26:24.424 --> 01:26:25.625]  They wonder why they're so unhappy.
[01:26:26.086 --> 01:26:27.267]  I mean, this is, this is who they are.
[01:26:27.287 --> 01:26:27.627]  Continue.
[01:26:29.615 --> 01:26:37.521]  Here, Hillary Clinton goes blank and forgets what she's saying.
[01:26:37.541 --> 01:26:41.384]  About healthcare, we need to make what we've got work really well.
[01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:42.785]  And improve it.
[01:26:43.205 --> 01:26:43.886]  And get the cost down.
[01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:45.627]  And improve the giant screw job that's Obamacare.
[01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:48.489]  And she starts having a seizure.
[01:26:48.509 --> 01:26:50.291]  Now I want to mention two other things.
[01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:52.856]  What do the following three videos have in common?
[01:26:53.357 --> 01:26:56.500]  Every time Hillary Clinton hears loud noises, she seizes up.
[01:27:10.743 --> 01:27:18.626]  At this rally on August 4th, 2016, Hillary Clinton is seen seizing up while her Secret Service supporters step forward.
[01:27:19.186 --> 01:27:24.107]  One of her agents on the far right, as you'll see, pulled something out of his jacket pocket.
[01:27:24.588 --> 01:27:26.088]  Anti-seizure injector.
[01:27:26.248 --> 01:27:28.889]  Okay, here we are!
[01:27:32.662 --> 01:27:38.393]  A rotting, wart covered brain and she can't turn loose of power.
[01:27:38.594 --> 01:27:41.760]  He grabs with his right arm inside his jacket pocket for something.
[01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:51.759]  On August 15, 2016, Hillary Clinton visited Joe Biden's home in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:57.203]  You can see her walk in unsteadily towards Joe Biden and the woman he's hugging here.
[01:27:57.623 --> 01:28:00.525]  But during the whole video, Hillary Clinton cannot stand upright.
[01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:05.729]  She keeps grabbing for a railing and even grabs for a table inside the house.
[01:28:05.869 --> 01:28:06.350]  Watch closely.
[01:28:07.719 --> 01:28:10.300]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.560]  Well, come on, let's get it.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:12.860]  Hi!
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.261]  How are you?
[01:28:15.301 --> 01:28:16.861]  Hi, I'm just waiting.
[01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:17.621]  More children.
[01:28:17.641 --> 01:28:21.242]  More blood.
[01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.442]  This is what evil does for us.
[01:28:22.503 --> 01:28:24.383]  This is where I grew up.
[01:28:24.483 --> 01:28:25.343]  I love it.
[01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:27.024]  Top of fifth street.
[01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:29.704]  And then she controls the party and has all the money.
[01:28:30.084 --> 01:28:35.806]  So she still is who they're gonna run.
[01:28:35.846 --> 01:28:37.006]  She says, I have a dark art.
[01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:39.560]  I've seen your heart, Hillary.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.180]  I guess I do.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.901]  Look at what a wack job she is and all of her demon followers.
[01:28:42.981 --> 01:28:44.082]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:28:44.202 --> 01:28:47.143]  We're gonna come back with your phone calls and a bunch of news straight ahead.
[01:28:47.343 --> 01:28:49.043]  Whatever you do, spread those live links.
[01:28:49.063 --> 01:28:49.824]  The enemy hates it.
[01:29:03.223 --> 01:29:08.804]  Alex Jones here with unbelievably critical information concerning the future of our Republic.
[01:29:09.484 --> 01:29:17.006]  A year and a half ago, just a few months into President Trump being in office, the globalists panicked because the economy began to turn around.
[01:29:19.306 --> 01:29:31.889]  Former Obama administration officials, former deputy heads of the Defense Department and others went to the Pentagon and to Congress and were even in major news publications like Atlantic Monthly
[01:29:32.904 --> 01:29:40.269]  Developing a public plan for a military coup against the president or a 25th amendment removal.
[01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:48.534]  I covered it at the time and mainstream corporate media attacked me and said it wasn't true because they didn't want to have major attention on it.
[01:29:48.595 --> 01:29:52.177]  They only wanted it in establishment publications like Atlantic Monthly.
[01:29:52.497 --> 01:29:54.719]  They did not want to be seen by the general public.
[01:29:54.739 --> 01:29:56.920]  They didn't want to have a debate about it early on.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.784]  They wanted to build their false case over the next year or so and then make their move on the president.
[01:30:03.544 --> 01:30:05.666]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're now making that move.
[01:30:05.786 --> 01:30:12.150]  In the last 24 hours, we've seen the former head of the CIA Brennan say that Trump is nothing short of treasonous.
[01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:13.610]  When it's Brennan that's the traitor.
[01:30:14.151 --> 01:30:19.594]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has said that the military needs to take him out.
[01:30:19.694 --> 01:30:20.315]  Where are they?
[01:30:20.635 --> 01:30:21.515]  Needs to remove them.
[01:30:22.136 --> 01:30:25.718]  Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA and the FBI,
[01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:26.778]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.267 --> 01:30:55.108]  And the globalists know that as everything we've talked about
[01:31:13.815 --> 01:31:13.955]  It's
[01:31:37.518 --> 01:31:40.280]  Defeat the Democrat-Globalist censorship plan.
[01:31:40.541 --> 01:31:41.281]  Supersale.

[01:32:17.182 --> 01:32:19.043]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven ourselves.
[01:32:19.063 --> 01:32:20.003]  That's why we're under attack.
[01:32:20.063 --> 01:32:22.903]  And we have this great crew standing in the face of this.
[01:32:23.184 --> 01:32:29.865]  And we have you, the listeners, and the viewers that support us, that make it possible, that pray for us, that share the articles and videos, and amplify our work.
[01:32:30.185 --> 01:32:31.085]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:32:31.585 --> 01:32:43.869]  Americana and true freedom and true Western civilization and true Christianity is the light of the world and we're bringing it back into the world boldly and the enemy is attacking us because they know we have the answer.
[01:32:44.129 --> 01:32:47.270]  We have the light in the dark of the night and so do all of you.
[01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:53.512]  So I ask you today to stand firm and hold fast with Infowars now more than ever.
[01:32:53.793 --> 01:32:54.793]  It's an incredible journey.
[01:32:55.213 --> 01:33:00.595]  History is happening now and all of you are in the arena right beside me in this historic fight.
[01:33:01.135 --> 01:33:02.696]  Thank you, and I salute you.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.162]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.626 --> 01:33:18.010]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.768 --> 01:33:25.812]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:33:26.252 --> 01:33:34.639]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:33:34.779 --> 01:33:46.148]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:33:46.248 --> 01:33:47.770]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:33:48.570 --> 01:34:04.464]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:34:04.525 --> 01:34:06.767]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:13.633]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.378]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:24.001]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:34:24.282 --> 01:34:25.382]  I like Venezuela.
[01:34:25.682 --> 01:34:27.023]  I don't like InfoWars.
[01:34:27.283 --> 01:34:28.344]  They're always right.
[01:34:28.684 --> 01:34:29.124]  Shut them down.
[01:34:29.144 --> 01:34:35.948]  They tell your kids they gotta love Justin Bieber, and then your children are turned into mindless vassals.
[01:34:36.148 --> 01:34:42.652]  They look up to some twit instead of looking up to Nikola Tesla, or looking up to Magellan.
[01:34:42.952 --> 01:34:47.215]  I mean kids, Magellan's a lot cooler than Justin Bieber!
[01:34:47.255 --> 01:34:51.998]  He circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet!
[01:34:52.358 --> 01:34:55.981]  He was killed by wild NATOs before they got back to Portugal!
[01:34:56.241 --> 01:35:04.567]  And when they got back there was only like 11 people alive of the 200 and something crew and the entire ship was rotting down to the waterline!
[01:35:04.967 --> 01:35:06.188]  That's destiny!
[01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:07.069]  That's will!
[01:35:07.429 --> 01:35:08.891]  That's striving!
[01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:11.193]  That's being a trailblazer and explorer!
[01:35:11.593 --> 01:35:12.714]  Going into space!
[01:35:12.954 --> 01:35:13.655]  Mathematics!
[01:35:13.755 --> 01:35:14.656]  Quantum mechanics!
[01:35:14.696 --> 01:35:15.977]  The secrets of the universe!
[01:35:16.197 --> 01:35:16.938]  It's all there!
[01:35:17.138 --> 01:35:18.940]  Life is fiery with its beauty!
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.781]  It's incredible detail!
[01:35:21.061 --> 01:35:22.022]  Tuning into it!
[01:35:22.122 --> 01:35:23.564]  They want to shatter your mind!
[01:35:23.744 --> 01:35:25.485]  Talking about Justin Bieber!
[01:35:31.493 --> 01:35:32.954]  Boy, I'd love to put that together.
[01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:36.638]  So many of those.
[01:35:38.279 --> 01:35:39.160]  Justin Bieber.
[01:35:39.841 --> 01:35:41.482]  They don't want you talking about the serious universe.
[01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:53.813]  They want you to talk about, oh, I'm going to teach my one-year-old, they might really be a girl if they're a boy, or boy if they're a girl, serious child abuse, all admittedly for depopulation, creating total mental illness.
[01:35:54.858 --> 01:35:56.319]  Blue State Collapse.
[01:35:56.819 --> 01:35:58.420]  There's more articles on that that have come out.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.941]  Okay, so here's what I'm going to do.
[01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:02.282]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now, one after the other.
[01:36:02.302 --> 01:36:05.644]  And then we're going to get into some of the positive news.
[01:36:05.804 --> 01:36:10.267]  South Korea considers withdrawing some forces from demilitarized zone.
[01:36:12.268 --> 01:36:14.910]  North Korea dismantling key missile facilities report.
[01:36:16.169 --> 01:36:18.090]  But that's Reuters, that's Voice of America.
[01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:19.630]  You're not going to hear that in the Washington Post.
[01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:25.612]  No, they just tell us how Trump's plan to denuclearize the peninsula is a failure.
[01:36:26.732 --> 01:36:30.353]  And then they use their national security clearances to create false info.
[01:36:31.294 --> 01:36:32.174]  And Trump's trying to pull those.
[01:36:32.554 --> 01:36:33.394]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[01:36:33.474 --> 01:36:38.376]  officially comes out and says China is in a war with us, a cold war, and is our enemy.
[01:36:38.996 --> 01:36:39.876]  Well, that's about time.
[01:36:39.896 --> 01:36:41.057]  They've been announcing that for years.
[01:36:42.197 --> 01:36:44.338]  They took Obama's sellout to him as weakness.
[01:36:46.368 --> 01:36:49.670]  Hasbro is to move a lot of its factories back to Mexico and the U.S.
[01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:51.932]  because of Trump's new tariffs on them.
[01:36:51.952 --> 01:36:55.014]  See, they have tariffs on us, we have tariffs on them.
[01:36:55.034 --> 01:37:03.399]  Nigel Farage says conservatives need more loop-headed socialists like Cortez.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.001]  Yeah, she says they're gonna have a big red victory.
[01:37:06.341 --> 01:37:07.742]  People said, oh, she's saying blue-red.
[01:37:07.762 --> 01:37:08.683]  No, no, she's a red.
[01:37:08.703 --> 01:37:10.965]  People are like, in fact, can we pull that clip up?
[01:37:10.985 --> 01:37:12.886]  I meant to play it yesterday.
[01:37:12.906 --> 01:37:14.347]  She's like, she's like,
[01:37:15.379 --> 01:37:22.886]  I'm here with Bernie Sanders, he's got even bigger Mr. Ed teeth than me, and we're going to turn this state red.
[01:37:22.906 --> 01:37:24.688]  Everybody's like, oh.
[01:37:25.308 --> 01:37:29.913]  Which I always thought, it should be, they are the reds, they should be red, we're blue, but whatever.
[01:37:29.933 --> 01:37:40.843]  I mean, look at Sanders, what a swindling, he owns three $1 million houses, drives $100,000 cars, is just a consummate fake slimeball.
[01:37:42.278 --> 01:37:45.059]  And he just slithers around with a slime trail behind him.
[01:37:45.419 --> 01:37:48.801]  And then he's got this lady that comes actually from a rich family, poses as a barista.
[01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:49.401]  It's all fake.
[01:37:50.221 --> 01:37:51.182]  But she's still an idiot.
[01:37:52.122 --> 01:37:55.243]  And I'd love to have a powerful woman in power, but this is a moron.
[01:37:55.263 --> 01:37:56.084]  Go to Venezuela, lady.
[01:37:56.444 --> 01:37:59.805]  Venezuela's inflation to reach 1 million percent IMF forecast.
[01:38:01.766 --> 01:38:02.906]  That's the Weimar Republic.
[01:38:02.946 --> 01:38:04.547]  It's already at several hundred thousand percent.
[01:38:06.004 --> 01:38:08.726]  They've already eaten their dogs and cats a few years ago, the zoo animals.
[01:38:08.786 --> 01:38:10.247]  It's a thousand a week, starved to death.
[01:38:10.267 --> 01:38:12.069]  But we need this here.
[01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.950]  Everything's free, though.
[01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:15.752]  There's nothing to buy or have, but it's all free.
[01:38:17.693 --> 01:38:22.537]  Like Sanders said, I go to the shopping center and there's 30 types of deodorant.
[01:38:22.718 --> 01:38:24.479]  I don't need that, okay?
[01:38:25.119 --> 01:38:27.742]  I, uh, honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
[01:38:27.762 --> 01:38:29.243]  We had our way with some Christians.
[01:38:30.224 --> 01:38:32.305]  I am superior to you!
[01:38:34.347 --> 01:38:35.248]  Bernie Sanders!
[01:38:38.275 --> 01:38:44.496]  I'll teach you flyover country, a thing or two about swindling colleges and stealing the money.
[01:38:46.397 --> 01:38:51.899]  But excuse me, let me get back to what I was saying.
[01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:52.959]  Here is the clip.
[01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:56.111]  Hello everybody!
[01:38:56.392 --> 01:39:03.138]  I'm so excited to be hopping on here at Senator Sanders' account and we're here in Kansas City to rally for Brent Welder.
[01:39:03.158 --> 01:39:05.299]  We're gonna flip this seat red in November.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.961]  Oh yeah.
[01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:10.064]  We're gonna flip this seat red in November.
[01:39:12.383 --> 01:39:13.724]  Hi, everybody!
[01:39:13.784 --> 01:39:18.767]  All the big banks and the Chinese government and the EU fund socialism to screw you over and enslave you.
[01:39:19.027 --> 01:39:20.448]  Hi, everybody!
[01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:22.490]  I'm here with this blood-drinking criminal.
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:24.531]  Oh, hi, everyone!
[01:39:24.551 --> 01:39:24.591]  Hi!
[01:39:26.152 --> 01:39:28.214]  Oh, Venezuela's collapsing.
[01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:29.474]  Four million are on their way here.
[01:39:29.855 --> 01:39:31.476]  Oh, hi, everybody!
[01:39:31.696 --> 01:39:33.998]  Here, let's hear what she's saying on Face the Nation right now.
[01:39:35.117 --> 01:39:37.819]  She ran an extraordinary campaign.
[01:39:37.899 --> 01:39:42.724]  She ran an extraordinary... Listen, I never had a paying job till I was 44.
[01:39:43.985 --> 01:39:47.708]  And we swindled companies and bankrupt colleges.
[01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:48.869]  Hold on, back him up!
[01:39:53.110 --> 01:39:54.731]  Other people aren't criminals like me.
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.614]  I think I'm over them because I have a criminal instinct.
[01:39:57.814 --> 01:40:01.677]  Look, I can F everybody over because they're not awake till I'm a criminal.
[01:40:01.977 --> 01:40:05.320]  I mean, just look at these people.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:05.780]  Go back.
[01:40:06.141 --> 01:40:06.601]  Start over.
[01:40:06.621 --> 01:40:09.764]  She ran an extraordinary campaign.
[01:40:10.424 --> 01:40:16.770]  And the reason that she won is she ran on ideas that were relevant to the working people in her district.
[01:40:17.757 --> 01:40:23.461]  She put together a strong grassroots campaign, and she worked her tail off.
[01:40:24.161 --> 01:40:32.046]  And any candidate in America... And any candidate in America, when I actually won the primaries, Hillary stole it, and I went along with it.
[01:40:32.467 --> 01:40:33.728]  Extraordinary campaign.
[01:40:34.308 --> 01:40:36.109]  And I want war with Russia!
[01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:39.491]  I just signed a bill, shut him up, shut me up!
[01:40:39.932 --> 01:40:41.333]  To have war with them!
[01:40:41.353 --> 01:40:46.256]  Because they're Christian now, and I have a heart on for Christians.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.380]  Let's hear more from The Muppet.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:56.603]  ...absolutely does bring up new voters and in fact we found this here in New York... Oh, like illegal aliens voting?
[01:40:56.623 --> 01:40:58.624]  With them legalizing it in San Francisco and New York?
[01:40:59.104 --> 01:41:01.445]  ...over the last off-year midterm primary.
[01:41:01.785 --> 01:41:09.128]  So for us, this is about inspiring people to the polls, giving them something to vote for, creating hope... Free stuff!
[01:41:09.208 --> 01:41:17.391]  ...and knowing that so long as there are working-class Americans who believe in a prosperous and just future, we will have hope no matter how red the district.
[01:41:17.742 --> 01:41:24.665]  You know, if she said, Bezos pays no taxes, it's 150 million, almost no taxes, or Google, or I'd be like, oh really?
[01:41:24.765 --> 01:41:26.446]  Oh, you want the trillion companies?
[01:41:26.986 --> 01:41:28.327]  And I'd be listening, oh, oh.
[01:41:28.767 --> 01:41:30.027]  Trump wants them to pay taxes too.
[01:41:30.487 --> 01:41:35.109]  But no, it's all like, we are going to give you free stuff and that's how the deal works.
[01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:36.190]  Okay, it's good.
[01:41:38.183 --> 01:41:38.984]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:41:39.004 --> 01:41:40.005]  We're coming back with your phone calls.
[01:41:40.765 --> 01:41:42.967]  Listen, I'm here at your sufferance.
[01:41:43.147 --> 01:41:44.348]  I'm here because you fund us.
[01:41:44.849 --> 01:41:46.090]  I won't exist without you.
[01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.850]  Figure it out.
[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:48.111]  You are the Infowar.
[01:41:48.372 --> 01:41:54.277]  That isn't me patting you on the head going, oh, you know, we're really here because of you.
[01:41:54.297 --> 01:41:54.937]  Thanks a lot.
[01:41:55.197 --> 01:41:56.438]  It's like people thank me.
[01:41:56.839 --> 01:41:58.400]  I'm fighting for my life and my futures.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.021]  You couldn't get me out of this fight.
[01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:01.983]  A bunch of pedophiles want to run my life.
[01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:02.984]  Think they're better than me?
[01:42:03.024 --> 01:42:03.564]  They've got to fight.
[01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:04.385]  They're going to get one.
[01:42:04.505 --> 01:42:04.865]  I love it.
[01:42:05.566 --> 01:42:08.709]  I don't wanna fight, why don't I just go all the way out crazed, you know what I mean?
[01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:11.993]  It's not like I'm trying to have bravado or chutzpah or being macho here.
[01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:15.657]  You're gonna fight, man, might as well just get into it, you know what I mean?
[01:42:16.698 --> 01:42:19.361]  Because when you start overthinking stuff, once you're in a fight, that's when you lose.
[01:42:19.962 --> 01:42:27.250]  Any fight I've ever been in, not that I'm the toughest guy around, I don't sit there and think about, a lot of guys punch you, and then they sit, or they slam your head in the ground, and they stand back and see what happened.
[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:29.633]  By that time, I've knocked their head off, politically.
[01:42:30.393 --> 01:42:33.657]  And that's what I'm saying right now, is I'm not looking for who's winning the game.
[01:42:33.777 --> 01:42:35.319]  I'm going after them hard.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:42.324]  And then we can count our money when the dealin's done to quote, uh, who is that old country singer?
[01:42:43.404 --> 01:42:43.905]  The Gambler.
[01:42:44.765 --> 01:42:45.306]  What's his name?
[01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:46.206]  I popped my head in a minute.
[01:42:46.586 --> 01:42:47.527]  I didn't even get to our plugs.
[01:42:48.287 --> 01:42:49.548]  I was gonna end the big sale yesterday.
[01:42:49.688 --> 01:42:51.369]  I've been so busy, haven't launched it in sale.
[01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:53.110]  Biggest sale we've ever done.
[01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:53.771]  67% off, 50% off.
[01:42:54.031 --> 01:42:54.851]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:42:54.871 --> 01:42:55.872]  We got products you need.

[01:42:59.214 --> 01:43:00.275]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.302]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[01:43:08.082 --> 01:43:16.085]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[01:43:16.525 --> 01:43:25.509]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the president.
[01:43:26.369 --> 01:43:33.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[01:43:34.138 --> 01:43:37.623]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[01:43:38.103 --> 01:43:44.971]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[01:43:45.872 --> 01:43:55.661]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out the Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[01:43:55.982 --> 01:43:59.805]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[01:44:00.426 --> 01:44:07.632]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[01:44:08.513 --> 01:44:25.770]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[01:44:26.491 --> 01:44:31.535]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[01:44:32.056 --> 01:44:38.101]  It's the communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[01:44:38.381 --> 01:44:39.702]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[01:44:40.022 --> 01:44:40.823]  They're the real traitors.
[01:44:41.263 --> 01:44:52.673]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen has called for a military coup against the president because he is a traitor working with the chi-coms, working with the multinational corporations.
[01:44:53.033 --> 01:45:01.318]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night and said Trump is a traitor.
[01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:09.483]  He needs to be overthrown for meeting with the Russian leader and being nice, at least in the things he said, but not in Trump's actions.
[01:45:09.623 --> 01:45:10.243]  It's incredible.
[01:45:10.683 --> 01:45:18.708]  And then we've got, of course, Rabid Wolf Blitzer attacking Senator Rand Paul for pointing out that Trump's just trying to stop a new Cold War.
[01:45:18.968 --> 01:45:19.448]  We're good to go.
[01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:51.662]  25th Amendment invoked, and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[01:45:52.022 --> 01:45:53.983]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[01:45:54.423 --> 01:46:08.711]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view, and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the President, and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the Republic.
[01:46:09.071 --> 01:46:10.572]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[01:46:10.672 --> 01:46:11.872]  So many great things are happening.
[01:46:12.073 --> 01:46:14.794]  We're making the nation great again, and these traitors can't stand it.
[01:46:15.154 --> 01:46:18.136]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[01:46:18.577 --> 01:46:22.140]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:30.486]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[01:46:30.606 --> 01:46:31.286]  Spread the article.
[01:46:31.326 --> 01:46:32.226]  Spread the videos.

[01:46:51.112 --> 01:46:54.573]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've backed InfoWars for more than 20 years and I want to thank you all.
[01:46:54.813 --> 01:47:00.439]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfoWarStore.com and support the InfoWar while getting great products.
[01:47:00.699 --> 01:47:01.520]  God bless you all.
[01:47:06.425 --> 01:47:09.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.898 --> 01:47:27.060]  On a warm summer's evening, on a train bound for Norway, I met up with a gambler.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:35.241]  We were both too tired to sleep, so we took turns of staring out the window at the darkness.
[01:47:35.741 --> 01:47:40.062]  The boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
[01:47:40.442 --> 01:47:42.563]  He said, son, I've made a life.
[01:47:43.542 --> 01:47:47.024]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up in just a moment.
[01:47:47.204 --> 01:47:50.226]  But let's hear this one little part about Kenny Rogers.
[01:47:50.266 --> 01:47:54.449]  Knowing when to hold him, knowing to fold him, knowing to walk away, knowing to run.
[01:48:15.664 --> 01:48:18.465]  This piece of news makes me so sick that
[01:48:45.073 --> 01:48:46.574]  Last night, my mother brought it up.
[01:48:46.674 --> 01:48:47.615]  She was over for dinner.
[01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:48.716]  Wonderful person.
[01:48:48.736 --> 01:48:49.316]  She brought it up.
[01:48:49.877 --> 01:48:51.418]  She'd seen it on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:55.101]  And I got so angry, I didn't yell or anything.
[01:48:55.121 --> 01:48:57.503]  I just said, I can't eat my food now.
[01:48:57.723 --> 01:48:58.944]  And I got up and went to my bedroom.
[01:48:59.704 --> 01:49:01.125]  I wanted to take a shower after work anyways.
[01:49:01.145 --> 01:49:01.886]  I hadn't taken a shower yet.
[01:49:01.946 --> 01:49:02.887]  And I just said, that's it.
[01:49:02.907 --> 01:49:03.507]  I can't eat.
[01:49:03.527 --> 01:49:03.967]  And I left.
[01:49:04.708 --> 01:49:05.589]  And everybody was fine.
[01:49:05.609 --> 01:49:06.769]  The kids were all sitting around the table.
[01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:09.471]  My three daughters and my son and my wife.
[01:49:10.172 --> 01:49:10.953]  My dad was over there.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:13.640]  And it wasn't that my mom made me mad.
[01:49:14.401 --> 01:49:24.403]  It was just that I hadn't covered it yesterday and I knew about it and I'd seen the report and it made my mind explode with understanding.
[01:49:25.304 --> 01:49:31.245]  And then there's that frustration when you're trying to explain a lifetime of knowledge on the air.
[01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:34.446]  It's not like you're on some power trip.
[01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:35.506]  It's that you suck.
[01:49:36.547 --> 01:49:37.707]  You can't explain it.
[01:49:38.601 --> 01:49:47.566]  How bad it is, like the way the parents are dressed, the get-ups the kids are in, just everything says an encyclopedia of knowledge.
[01:49:48.787 --> 01:50:00.734]  And then you just read what's right below the surface and it's like... It's a cult of screwing children up.
[01:50:04.019 --> 01:50:06.781]  And it's a cult of just weirdos, man.
[01:50:06.801 --> 01:50:11.664]  And I've read Skinner, I've read Pavlov.
[01:50:11.924 --> 01:50:17.048]  I mean, some of those guys kept their kids in boxes until they committed suicide at 12.
[01:50:19.168 --> 01:50:25.578]  You know, lobotomies with ice picks and just the weird cult of this group calling themselves doctors.
[01:50:26.158 --> 01:50:33.809]  And then now they got 30% of people on psychotropics that eat your brain and cause psychotic breaks and massively increase depression and suicide.
[01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:35.452]  The insert says it.
[01:50:41.431 --> 01:50:50.734]  And then you look at the weird, soft zombies that don't even know what they're doing, that are the followers of this, and they all, whether they be black, white, or Hispanic, but they're mainly white.
[01:50:52.254 --> 01:51:00.337]  The men all have this weird, like, you know, that cult look, like you saw in Wild Wild Country, or whatever, with the Rajni Bhagwan.
[01:51:01.357 --> 01:51:09.180]  And it's like... The defense mechanisms are lowering.
[01:51:10.854 --> 01:51:16.897]  And you've got these leftist cults that like smile and give people these attention as long as they do these terrible things.
[01:51:16.957 --> 01:51:22.260]  I mean, look, I don't, if you're a lesbian and you like women, I'm a guy, I kind of figure that, I like women too, I kind of, can't be a hypocrite.
[01:51:23.381 --> 01:51:28.384]  I kind of, I get where you're coming from, but, you know, lesbian like, Samuel Paglia studied history.
[01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:30.262]  She's got PhDs.
[01:51:30.662 --> 01:51:38.846]  She'll tell you, it's abuse, man, to take kids and sexualize them when they're three years old, four years old, and say, you're really a girl if you're a boy, or vice versa, or you could be something else.
[01:51:39.246 --> 01:51:41.987]  It just, it makes them think about sex before they're even thinking about it.
[01:51:42.248 --> 01:51:44.309]  It ruins their creativity.
[01:51:44.349 --> 01:51:45.409]  It ruins their future.
[01:51:45.449 --> 01:51:46.830]  It steals their soul.
[01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:56.295]  And then NBC and everybody else puts this out, and in school admission forms all over the Western world, they say,
[01:51:57.881 --> 01:51:58.982]  Don't say mother or father.
[01:51:59.082 --> 01:52:00.823]  Someone else might not have a mother or father.
[01:52:00.863 --> 01:52:04.145]  So see, we can't be male because somebody else doesn't like being a male.
[01:52:04.205 --> 01:52:05.005]  We can't be female.
[01:52:05.365 --> 01:52:15.592]  This, it's all created to create a bunch of confused, screwed up people that the system can control.
[01:52:15.612 --> 01:52:16.892]  And it's so predatory.
[01:52:16.912 --> 01:52:25.998]  And then you see the left, not just in this video, but the one we shot at the, I went into a pizza place about six months ago.
[01:52:26.874 --> 01:52:41.709]  And there was this young man behind the counter and he said, I saw your Millie Weaver video of the Drag Queen Festival in Austin at a hotel.
[01:52:41.729 --> 01:52:43.951]  And he said, you know, we're not bad.
[01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:44.912]  We're having a great time.
[01:52:44.992 --> 01:52:45.533]  It's fun.
[01:52:45.613 --> 01:52:46.334]  You ought to love it.
[01:52:46.574 --> 01:52:48.876]  And then he was like trying to be, to me and my wife, like,
[01:52:49.838 --> 01:52:56.922]  Alluring to us and was just doing these weird feminine facsimiles to us like dancing around behind the counter We're trying to pay for this pizza.
[01:52:56.942 --> 01:53:03.986]  We're picking up And I said listen, I don't hate you for who you are individually But I said at that drag queen festival.
[01:53:04.006 --> 01:53:13.112]  They had three-year-olds putting money in the g-strings and in the thongs of obese men and they had shots of men totally naked and
[01:53:13.891 --> 01:53:16.512]  With only glitter on their genitals hanging down.
[01:53:16.532 --> 01:53:17.433]  I don't even want to show it.
[01:53:17.753 --> 01:53:26.338]  With like three-year-old kids standing next to men with, you know, we're talking Louisville Sluggers, man, hanging down with silver glitter all over it.
[01:53:26.478 --> 01:53:28.999]  I mean, you know, yeah, there's some of it.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.341]  It's like, what the hell, man?
[01:53:32.361 --> 01:53:33.722]  It's like, oh, be nice to us.
[01:53:33.742 --> 01:53:35.803]  And then like, we're going to teach your kids this.
[01:53:36.524 --> 01:53:38.345]  And it's pure evil.
[01:53:38.965 --> 01:53:42.427]  And then Hollywood's promoting pedophilia and all this is going on.
[01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:47.331]  But that guy I talked to behind the counter, he was drunk on it.
[01:53:50.191 --> 01:53:56.313]  And then like, looking at me and my wife, my gorgeous wife, who wasn't even dolled up that day, but you know, she was, she's sexy.
[01:53:56.793 --> 01:54:02.834]  And the guy was like looking at her, and he looked at her, and he went like this, he went... Go to a shot of me.
[01:54:03.774 --> 01:54:05.295]  The guy behind the counter goes like this to my wife, he goes...
[01:54:06.545 --> 01:54:07.366]  Like, I'm the woman.
[01:54:07.686 --> 01:54:10.128]  It's this, it's like, I'm a man, I'm a woman, I'm everything.
[01:54:10.548 --> 01:54:14.831]  It's like this weird, we're taking control of reproduction, we're taking control of the species, and it's just like...
[01:54:17.216 --> 01:54:18.537]  And then these families sit there.
[01:54:18.577 --> 01:54:19.777]  So my son did a video on it.
[01:54:19.797 --> 01:54:21.038]  Exposed evil.
[01:54:21.698 --> 01:54:22.178]  Exposed.
[01:54:22.338 --> 01:54:25.980]  Evil pedophile plot to sexualize and destroy children by normalizing mental illness.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.160]  And that's exactly what it is.
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.121]  And this is how they sell the whole thing.
[01:54:29.141 --> 01:54:31.962]  So Rex Jones' report is up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:32.402 --> 01:54:39.385]  I'm going to go to Billy and David and Tyler and Andrew and Mike and John and Jim and Justin and Rick and Kevin and everybody else.
[01:54:39.445 --> 01:54:40.126]  No female caller.
[01:54:40.146 --> 01:54:40.846]  We should get some of those.
[01:54:40.866 --> 01:54:41.706]  Sometimes we have all women.
[01:54:41.726 --> 01:54:42.367]  Sometimes we have no women.
[01:54:42.447 --> 01:54:43.227]  It seems to be either or.
[01:54:43.827 --> 01:54:45.608]  But whatever issue you want to cover, we want to talk to you.
[01:54:45.628 --> 01:54:46.048]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:54:46.068 --> 01:54:54.733]  There's big stories up on newswars.com I want to get to too, but let me just play this clip since I mentioned it of ABC News.
[01:54:56.914 --> 01:54:57.574]  ABC News.
[01:54:58.855 --> 01:54:59.475]  NBC News.
[01:54:59.815 --> 01:55:02.957]  Promotes parents who refuse to assign gender to their three-year-olds.
[01:55:03.317 --> 01:55:04.658]  Well, you're not assigning
[01:55:05.558 --> 01:55:06.518]  But you're not being the parent.
[01:55:06.538 --> 01:55:08.519]  You're letting the state and the media be the parent.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.941]  But they have assigned a gender.
[01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:12.341]  It's rainbow outfits.
[01:55:12.861 --> 01:55:14.322]  It's we've sexualized our kids.
[01:55:14.662 --> 01:55:18.224]  We're injecting them into this whole lobby.
[01:55:18.884 --> 01:55:21.265]  And it's a thing about corrupting kids, in my view.
[01:55:22.026 --> 01:55:22.466]  It's sick.
[01:55:22.486 --> 01:55:25.868]  And it's all declassified, a program to end population.
[01:55:25.928 --> 01:55:31.430]  So, just like we didn't get rid of fire ants, you created things so they don't mate or whatever.
[01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:32.511]  This is the plan.
[01:55:32.551 --> 01:55:32.871]  Here it is.
[01:55:36.158 --> 01:55:37.399]  Are we a normal family?
[01:55:37.679 --> 01:55:41.182]  We have two kids, order Domino's for dinner sometimes.
[01:55:41.202 --> 01:55:42.042]  Alright, I'm ready to go.
[01:55:42.362 --> 01:55:44.304]  In many ways, we... Hit pause.
[01:55:45.044 --> 01:55:46.485]  By the way, they say they let their kids choose.
[01:55:46.525 --> 01:55:48.867]  They got the boy dressed up like a girl and vice versa.
[01:55:48.907 --> 01:55:49.547]  That's what they do.
[01:55:51.108 --> 01:55:53.210]  And so, you just can't sit there with your son...
[01:55:55.694 --> 01:55:57.516]  You just have, you can't stand it.
[01:55:57.556 --> 01:55:59.178]  You've got to do the brainwashing.
[01:55:59.398 --> 01:55:59.738]  Continue.
[01:56:16.897 --> 01:56:26.404]  And a lot of you'll say, well, this won't happen.
[01:56:26.704 --> 01:56:28.205]  No, they got your kids in the schools right now.
[01:56:28.705 --> 01:56:32.648]  I got a stack of news of folks paralyzed, killed from vaccines to go to college.
[01:56:32.668 --> 01:56:33.609]  Just today it popped up.
[01:56:34.489 --> 01:56:36.511]  They're going to put in your body what they want.
[01:56:36.611 --> 01:56:37.592]  They run your life.
[01:56:37.652 --> 01:56:38.552]  They've got your kids.
[01:56:38.853 --> 01:56:40.173]  And these people are just rolling over.
[01:56:40.214 --> 01:56:41.474]  They're just the Stockholm syndrome.
[01:56:41.715 --> 01:56:42.015]  Here it is.
[01:56:47.739 --> 01:56:48.600]  Oh, how beautiful.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.764]  Raising... They tell your kids, you're not a boy or girl, you're just an it.
[01:56:54.685 --> 01:56:56.386]  All the chemicals, the water, you will be.
[01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:01.971]  These kids are prisoners, in my view.
[01:57:05.694 --> 01:57:07.495]  Can't tell what's a boy, can't tell what's a girl.
[01:57:07.536 --> 01:57:10.318]  Just... total victimization.
[01:57:11.613 --> 01:57:18.535]  But at a satanic level, even if the parents don't get it consciously, there's nothing like feeding off the energy of a child, and like, destroying the order.
[01:57:19.276 --> 01:57:19.836]  That's power.
[01:57:20.336 --> 01:57:26.958]  So who's powerless, man and woman, who... So I think that knowing the sex or the gender of your child is important to other people, partially, just because it's part of the social script?
[01:57:27.799 --> 01:57:30.500]  No, it ain't part of the social script, it's part of biology and mammals, lady.
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.261]  Because they have no idea that some children are she, and some children are he?
[01:57:35.521 --> 01:57:36.081]  Alright!
[01:57:36.382 --> 01:57:37.222]  So now they're playing the game.
[01:57:38.174 --> 01:57:38.734]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:57:38.794 --> 01:57:39.795]  They control reality.
[01:57:39.815 --> 01:57:40.615]  They control your children.
[01:57:40.635 --> 01:57:43.237]  We'll be back with our number three with your phone call straight ahead.
[01:57:43.817 --> 01:57:44.637]  Newswars.com.
[01:57:52.801 --> 01:57:53.462]  It's all happening.
[01:57:54.982 --> 01:57:56.103]  Trump is a nationalist.
[01:57:57.163 --> 01:57:58.084]  The country's coming back.
[01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:08.056]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him for a military coup, or for the 25th Amendment.
[01:58:08.176 --> 01:58:09.116]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:09.456 --> 01:58:10.477]  It's all happening right now.
[01:58:10.997 --> 01:58:20.444]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[01:58:21.144 --> 01:58:29.270]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:30.570]  They're the traitors.
[01:58:31.331 --> 01:58:33.331]  They may be successful removing our president.
[01:58:33.652 --> 01:58:36.012]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:36.493 --> 01:58:41.355]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[01:58:41.635 --> 01:58:44.076]  We are in the middle of a second American Revolution.
[01:58:44.436 --> 01:58:47.137]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[01:58:47.597 --> 01:58:51.699]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[01:58:51.719 --> 01:58:54.301]  We just keep boosting the sales.

[01:58:56.802 --> 01:59:02.385]  It's Defeat the Democrat Slash Globalist Plan to Censor Infowars and the Web Super Sale.

[01:59:32.268 --> 01:59:32.629]  All of it.
[01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:34.510]  We're coming through the storm thanks to you.
[01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:35.891]  Shop with the good guys.
[01:59:36.151 --> 01:59:36.912]  Pay it forward.
[01:59:37.232 --> 01:59:41.435]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:42.055 --> 01:59:43.516]  This is the battle for the future.
[01:59:43.856 --> 01:59:44.977]  This is the war for the future.
[01:59:45.337 --> 01:59:48.819]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:49.480]  Thank you.
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:51.101]  I'm counting on you and I salute you.
[01:59:56.644 --> 02:00:03.588]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:09.391 --> 02:00:13.173]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:00:17.987 --> 02:00:29.693]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:00:29.713 --> 02:00:31.274]  Scum!
[02:00:31.954 --> 02:00:34.375]  Russian scum!
[02:00:34.475 --> 02:00:39.598]  Until worse comes to mind.
[02:00:43.686 --> 02:00:45.150]  Your reputation is amazing.
[02:00:45.611 --> 02:00:46.954]  I will not let you down.
[02:00:47.095 --> 02:00:49.982]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:00:54.977 --> 02:01:08.001]  There is a scientific declassified plan developed by the British government a hundred years ago to break down the family, to create asexualization in humans, but to do that first they've got to confuse the gender.
[02:01:08.581 --> 02:01:17.024]  And what's crazy is you can go read Pavlov, you can go read Skinner, you can go read all this in textbooks written 70, 80, 90 years ago.
[02:01:17.864 --> 02:01:20.965]  And then you've got these parents trying to conform with the system
[02:01:21.906 --> 02:01:26.388]  Telling their young boys you might be a girl or boy, their young girls vice versa.
[02:01:27.248 --> 02:01:34.611]  And seriously abusing children when there is really no even gender activity going on outside of genetics until they hit puberty.
[02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:42.554]  All the studies show you sexualize children earlier, you lower IQs, you stump them, you really screw them up for life.
[02:01:43.334 --> 02:01:47.696]  So this is the full push and it's being done scientifically.
[02:01:48.599 --> 02:01:50.179]  And it's very abusive to children.
[02:01:50.219 --> 02:01:51.240]  It's very, very shameful.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:52.160]  It's very, very sick.
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:02:02.362]  And behind it all is the North American Man Boy Love Association, who seek to emancipate your children so that pot-bellied men can have sex with them.
[02:02:02.402 --> 02:02:04.262]  And Hollywood's really upset right now.
[02:02:04.282 --> 02:02:08.123]  We have a special guest coming up towards the end of the hour who's exposing all this.
[02:02:08.143 --> 02:02:10.984]  But now they're saying, bring Mr. Gunn, the director, back.
[02:02:12.404 --> 02:02:14.785]  And, you know, so what if he said he wants to rape little kids?
[02:02:14.805 --> 02:02:15.405]  It's no big deal.
[02:02:16.636 --> 02:02:32.864]  So this is the final closet that is to be opened by the Subway founder, and by Mr. Gunn, and by Dennis Astert, and by all of these people that are there psychotroping their children and, in my view, feeding off their spirits.
[02:02:34.705 --> 02:02:37.046]  The weak seek the power and the essence of the children.
[02:02:39.968 --> 02:02:42.109]  And those of us that have stood down have allowed this to happen.
[02:02:44.187 --> 02:02:45.008]  Suffer the little children.
[02:02:45.028 --> 02:02:46.970]  Alright, I'm done talking about that.
[02:02:48.331 --> 02:02:57.899]  I just want to be fair to these callers so I'm going to wait for the next segment and then I'm going right to Billy, right to Dave, right to Tyler, right to Andrew, right to Mike, right to John, right to Jim, Justin, Rick, Kevin and others.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.483]  And like I said, sometimes it's like all women, sometimes it's all men.
[02:03:01.543 --> 02:03:09.169]  It's like you see a kind of either or when they call in, but we also, we don't really screen your calls except for phone quality and that you've actually got an issue that you want to cover.
[02:03:11.052 --> 02:03:16.557]  There, but we want to discuss these issues all with you in detail when we start the next segment.
[02:03:17.317 --> 02:03:20.740]  I'm Owen Moore Stenehame.
[02:03:23.222 --> 02:03:28.666]  It was 11 years ago that the globalists were doing a bunch of stuff behind the scenes trying to shut me down.
[02:03:29.347 --> 02:03:30.107]  They were in the news.
[02:03:30.167 --> 02:03:33.070]  We were bringing in like three, four million dollars a year total.
[02:03:33.991 --> 02:03:34.611]  That meant profit.
[02:03:34.631 --> 02:03:35.992]  I was making a few hundred thousand dollars a year.
[02:03:36.472 --> 02:03:37.232]  That's not my goal.
[02:03:37.252 --> 02:03:38.333]  Nothing wrong with wealth.
[02:03:38.973 --> 02:03:39.774]  But that wasn't my goal.
[02:03:39.794 --> 02:03:40.734]  It was just more wealth.
[02:03:41.474 --> 02:03:43.755]  And they demonized me and said, Jones just wants to make money.
[02:03:43.795 --> 02:03:44.956]  So I made a declaration.
[02:03:45.016 --> 02:03:47.037]  I said, I'll try to build something big.
[02:03:48.769 --> 02:03:50.830]  And we ratcheted up, you know, $60 million a year.
[02:03:51.230 --> 02:04:00.592]  But when your products are only marked up on sale 20, 30, 40 percent, and you have all these expenses, you know, you're bringing in to fund your operation $20 million a year.
[02:04:00.652 --> 02:04:05.153]  So then you spend it all, and then George Soros sues you, and all the rest of it takes place.
[02:04:05.193 --> 02:04:14.376]  But I know we can take this to a billion-dollar level if I just was a harder worker and actually more hungry for temporal success.
[02:04:14.796 --> 02:04:16.136]  Not that I want the temporal success.
[02:04:16.156 --> 02:04:17.817]  That's my weakness, is I don't care about it.
[02:04:18.673 --> 02:04:23.235]  My car runs good and I got medical care taken care of and I can get food I want and go on a trip twice a year.
[02:04:24.215 --> 02:04:25.616]  Money's like something to mess with.
[02:04:25.676 --> 02:04:26.856]  It's like, oh God, yeah.
[02:04:26.876 --> 02:04:28.457]  But then I realize I've got to get it.
[02:04:29.657 --> 02:04:30.358]  And you've got it.
[02:04:31.578 --> 02:04:34.519]  And the enemy obsesses on the fact that you buy our products constantly.
[02:04:34.639 --> 02:04:36.320]  Oh God, shut him down.
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:37.280]  Don't get the t-shirts.
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.141]  Don't get the supplements.
[02:04:38.301 --> 02:04:40.282]  Oh, you don't need water filtration.
[02:04:40.482 --> 02:04:43.163]  You know, Hogg says,
[02:04:45.171 --> 02:04:48.854]  He says the NRA are Russian agents in his latest article.
[02:04:53.057 --> 02:04:55.438]  I'm a Russian agent like I'm an Easter Bunny.
[02:04:59.301 --> 02:05:01.583]  You know, my family fought the Russians.
[02:05:04.122 --> 02:05:09.186]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[02:05:09.846 --> 02:05:15.010]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[02:05:15.351 --> 02:05:22.036]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[02:05:22.756 --> 02:05:25.939]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[02:05:26.679 --> 02:05:30.382]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[02:05:30.922 --> 02:05:32.083]  And my only message is this.
[02:05:32.344 --> 02:05:35.406]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[02:05:36.247 --> 02:05:43.752]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[02:05:44.253 --> 02:05:47.095]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[02:05:47.115 --> 02:05:48.036]  We already have the power.
[02:05:48.276 --> 02:05:53.180]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.441]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[02:05:56.721 --> 02:05:58.021]  We are the resistance!
[02:05:58.041 --> 02:06:05.303]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:05.343 --> 02:06:07.583]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.313 --> 02:06:32.800]  Obviously we're covering the waterfront here.
[02:06:34.034 --> 02:06:36.636]  Trump is now striking at the heart of the situation.
[02:06:36.656 --> 02:06:45.604]  These globalists that are anti-American, working for the chat coms, the EU, the Hollywood Combine, trying to say the president's a traitor, leaking info.
[02:06:46.204 --> 02:06:52.810]  It's twisted, but they use their security clearance to be able to talk to people that are in government to command the shadow forces.
[02:06:53.591 --> 02:07:01.778]  By cutting their security clearances, like they tried to do with Trump's cabinet to stop him, by cutting their security clearances, if they then communicate,
[02:07:02.358 --> 02:07:05.741]  With their operatives, they can be indicted.
[02:07:05.761 --> 02:07:08.743]  There's a bigger enchilada to all this.
[02:07:08.823 --> 02:07:16.029]  And notice the control media is like, oh, they don't even use their clearances, Comey and Brennan and Clapper and all the rest of these traitors.
[02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:18.031]  Yes, they do.
[02:07:19.072 --> 02:07:21.834]  That's how they talk to their operatives in the government.
[02:07:26.442 --> 02:07:26.962]  Finally!
[02:07:28.003 --> 02:07:35.349]  Only now do you begin to imagine how we encompass your doom!
[02:07:40.413 --> 02:07:42.054]  Your season has come to an end.
[02:07:42.074 --> 02:07:43.315]  A new season is here.
[02:07:46.858 --> 02:07:49.640]  Because we know humanity faces big challenges soon.
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.861]  We have to get ready for those.
[02:07:53.363 --> 02:07:54.704]  We have to get ready to make the jump.
[02:07:59.172 --> 02:08:03.397]  Time for this solar system is coming to an end.
[02:08:04.839 --> 02:08:05.841]  Everything counts down.
[02:08:06.842 --> 02:08:07.803]  Everything's been laid out.
[02:08:09.405 --> 02:08:11.428]  We've got maybe a hundred years to make the jump.
[02:08:15.553 --> 02:08:16.114]  But evil...
[02:08:17.572 --> 02:08:24.237]  Resonates with these low-level people to try to freeze us here and keep us here, delay us here.
[02:08:24.277 --> 02:08:24.958]  It's not happening.
[02:08:25.418 --> 02:08:26.859]  You will not stop the progress.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:38.588]  Our ancestors in their purity, and by purity I mean not pious purity, but genetic purity in the raw
[02:08:39.474 --> 02:08:47.840]  primordial system they came from, their will has a dimensional weight that punches through anything these satanists do.
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:49.481]  We just have to call upon it.
[02:08:51.903 --> 02:08:58.548]  It's like a thousand foot Hoover Dam and the weight of all that water behind it, and no wonder the enemy wants to keep us dumbed down.
[02:08:59.408 --> 02:09:04.572]  Even a mentally retarded person can call on ancestral will and dominate.
[02:09:06.263 --> 02:09:09.966]  In fact, sometimes even stronger than someone that doesn't have an extra chromosome.
[02:09:10.266 --> 02:09:12.047]  And those anomalies have been noticed.
[02:09:12.087 --> 02:09:15.090]  The enemy can feel the full will.
[02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:19.853]  And to these fallen individuals, the will of humanity is a very frightening thing.
[02:09:20.194 --> 02:09:21.775]  It is frightening.
[02:09:24.277 --> 02:09:25.157]  It's the fear of God.
[02:09:26.178 --> 02:09:32.203]  God fashioned us, made us in his image, knew us before we were in our mother's womb.
[02:09:35.302 --> 02:09:39.686]  God created these enemies to test his people.
[02:09:42.529 --> 02:09:47.754]  And then you're not scared of Mueller, Mueller, all these little people.
[02:09:50.557 --> 02:09:51.618]  Once you step past them,
[02:09:53.698 --> 02:09:57.341]  All of eternity is before you, and it's all a giant loop.
[02:09:57.481 --> 02:09:59.883]  You're like, the past, the present, the future, all of it.
[02:10:00.324 --> 02:10:02.345]  And you're like, it's not just the past, the present, the future.
[02:10:02.566 --> 02:10:04.407]  That's only one spectrum, third dimension.
[02:10:04.687 --> 02:10:09.932]  Then you can delve as deep as you want to go, and you're like, the Satanists want to serve this?
[02:10:10.592 --> 02:10:13.395]  Why the secrets of Satanism take 30 seconds to know?
[02:10:14.015 --> 02:10:17.838]  To even look into the heights of higher dimensions in God is just...
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.741]  Is Valhalla to the next level?
[02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:23.903]  And then you wonder, how could they do this?
[02:10:24.223 --> 02:10:27.285]  Because they were given power in this dimension.
[02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:35.111]  Think about that.
[02:10:35.631 --> 02:10:41.395]  If you were a schoolmaster that served evil, and you knew a new generation was coming that would open the stars.
[02:10:43.356 --> 02:10:44.157]  If you knew that,
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:49.142]  But you were serving evil, you would try to cripple and control those people.
[02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:55.085]  And even though you know they were more advanced than you, you would then try to like shatter their minds, but then steal their ideas.
[02:10:55.525 --> 02:10:59.127]  And that's what this is, a cosmic con game coming to an end.
[02:11:00.907 --> 02:11:04.049]  And it doesn't mean some utopia comes after this.
[02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:05.730]  That is not what's going to happen.
[02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:08.051]  It's simply the next level.
[02:11:09.522 --> 02:11:15.205]  And then we'll look past this in the future together and we'll say that was what we were fighting.
[02:11:16.046 --> 02:11:19.348]  We'll laugh together when we are at the next level together.
[02:11:19.368 --> 02:11:21.970]  We were worried about that.
[02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:23.150]  Look at that!
[02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:29.414]  Because nothing is given.
[02:11:29.754 --> 02:11:30.995]  Everything has to be achieved.
[02:11:37.073 --> 02:11:38.494]  People go, that sounds fantastical.
[02:11:38.794 --> 02:11:40.316]  Have you looked where you are?
[02:11:41.897 --> 02:11:43.118]  You're at the way station.
[02:11:43.958 --> 02:11:46.540]  You're at the lily pad, the big pond.
[02:11:49.363 --> 02:11:53.065]  And out beyond is the mountains and the sky and the universe.
[02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:56.968]  It's endless, the potential God's given you, but it's free will.
[02:11:57.689 --> 02:12:00.331]  God isn't going to let demons into the fourth dimension.
[02:12:04.714 --> 02:12:05.315]  Not going to happen.
[02:12:07.793 --> 02:12:16.799]  But it's very freeing once you have stared over the Misty Mountains, once you have seen the potential and know there's really good in the universe, not just evil.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:24.985]  It's a great comforter to know no matter what happens to these little frail bodies, these ugly things, that there's a bigger plan.
[02:12:28.541 --> 02:12:34.803]  And then you go, oh my God, it's like birds, cowbirds, go and kick out the eggs of other birds and lay their eggs.
[02:12:34.863 --> 02:12:35.684]  It's the same deal.
[02:12:36.224 --> 02:12:43.147]  Once you get it, you're like, oh my God, this demon thing is telling me how corrupt I am because I have a conscience and I know I'm not perfect, so I'm listening.
[02:12:43.187 --> 02:12:44.187]  Oh yeah, I want to be better, you're right.
[02:12:44.587 --> 02:12:46.908]  But that's, it's a lie.
[02:12:51.710 --> 02:13:00.980]  And once you don't listen to the devil, the accuser, always accusing you, always telling you how you're bad, always telling you how you're failed, always telling you how you're ugly, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, because it knows you've got a soul.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.721]  It knows you've got that ping.
[02:13:02.781 --> 02:13:04.043]  It can, it can hack that.
[02:13:04.103 --> 02:13:06.485]  It can send, it doesn't have that, but it knows you've got it.
[02:13:06.525 --> 02:13:14.574]  So it just keeps telling you how you're a Nazi and how you're this and how you're that and how you're fallen and how you're, so you kind of get off balance and give it your power when the minute
[02:13:15.799 --> 02:13:20.801]  You go, I'm not perfect, but I love God and I want justice and I want a future and I want whatever the next level is.
[02:13:20.841 --> 02:13:21.722]  My God, I can feel it.
[02:13:21.942 --> 02:13:22.842]  Whatever it is, it's good.
[02:13:22.882 --> 02:13:24.263]  I want to go up, not down.
[02:13:28.325 --> 02:13:28.585]  You're free.
[02:13:35.502 --> 02:13:41.227]  I'm going to shut up here, because they got a special... I didn't have a guest today, but I wanted to get this one guest on about Hollywood apologizing for pedophilia.
[02:13:41.267 --> 02:13:43.108]  And notice, we're forcing it all out in the open.
[02:13:43.649 --> 02:13:45.170]  They tried to normalize it a few years ago.
[02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:45.550]  It didn't work.
[02:13:45.570 --> 02:13:46.991]  So they're like, oh, it doesn't exist.
[02:13:49.453 --> 02:13:53.717]  Oh, and the off-record stuff I've gotten about Pizzagate, I took it to lawyers in D.C.
[02:14:06.075 --> 02:14:10.297]  You know, it's the people that were abused that are then the procurers of the other kids.
[02:14:11.038 --> 02:14:12.318]  And they actually think it's love.
[02:14:13.899 --> 02:14:16.240]  They're the lower level people that were raped as children.
[02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:19.702]  And then they go out and they recruit others and they think it's love.
[02:14:19.722 --> 02:14:25.665]  Because like, you know, a guy thinks dating women is what you do because that's the love they experienced or whatever.
[02:14:25.685 --> 02:14:29.567]  And then they sit there and it's so sick.
[02:14:29.687 --> 02:14:30.708]  It's so unbelievable.
[02:14:34.571 --> 02:14:37.573]  I remember 30 years ago I was getting politically involved.
[02:14:41.035 --> 02:14:41.736]  27 years ago.
[02:14:42.896 --> 02:15:02.389]  And all these old timers, these guys were like colonels in the army and air force generals and I'd go to these meetings when I was like 18 and and you'd like go in there be some three-star general and there were like 20 dudes and an IHOP with a presentation on the wall about the you know the plan to Satanist to get the kids and you're like
[02:15:03.129 --> 02:15:04.290]  These people are crazy.
[02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:06.512]  But then they knew everything else I already knew.
[02:15:06.532 --> 02:15:12.537]  So I was like, I still like, like, they're like, there's a place called Bohemian Grove, and that's just the outer levels of it.
[02:15:12.577 --> 02:15:17.941]  And it's a Faustian ritual they do to put the cares of their Satanism off on a child.
[02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:22.365]  And it's symbolic, but it's an outer ritual for the lesser magic of the deeper ritual.
[02:15:22.725 --> 02:15:23.525]  And you're sitting there.
[02:15:24.346 --> 02:15:40.144]  You know with the former Marine Corps three-star general or a former three-star Air Force weapons head or you know and they're like telling you this stuff and you're like what and they're like listen we they tried to recruit us you're gonna have to get ready and you know I knew all this stuff
[02:15:41.627 --> 02:15:43.429]  And then it just all turned out to be real.
[02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:50.236]  I remember being four years old with like an FBI agent and an army colonel and all these people at my dad's house.
[02:15:50.576 --> 02:15:53.199]  And they're all sitting around the table talking about this and how do we beat it.
[02:15:53.599 --> 02:15:56.402]  And just all these decades later, 40 years later, it's all true.
[02:15:57.343 --> 02:15:57.823]  It's all true.
[02:15:57.843 --> 02:16:00.406]  I mean, I was so blessed to be born into people that knew what was happening.
[02:16:02.662 --> 02:16:04.723]  The deep state is making its move.
[02:16:05.363 --> 02:16:12.985]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA, are all on television saying, we need the military to remove the president.
[02:16:13.845 --> 02:16:18.987]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum, 25th Amendment, to remove him from office.
[02:16:19.027 --> 02:16:19.367]  And why?
[02:16:19.847 --> 02:16:32.965]  Because he went and had a summit, a year and a half plus into office, that he should have had a month into office, with Vladimir Putin, and met with him privately, just like he did with Theresa May, and dozens of other world leaders, like the communist Chinese dictator.
[02:16:33.246 --> 02:16:36.270]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[02:16:37.211 --> 02:16:44.993]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth, Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[02:16:45.073 --> 02:16:49.895]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[02:16:50.015 --> 02:16:50.795]  It's incredible.
[02:16:51.155 --> 02:16:52.395]  But here's the big takeaway.
[02:16:53.056 --> 02:16:55.356]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[02:16:55.656 --> 02:16:57.877]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[02:16:59.082 --> 02:17:10.646]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[02:17:11.466 --> 02:17:12.667]  The EU is unelected.
[02:17:13.287 --> 02:17:15.648]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[02:17:16.388 --> 02:17:18.329]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[02:17:18.369 --> 02:17:19.309]  We have nothing on them.
[02:17:19.770 --> 02:17:22.431]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[02:17:22.651 --> 02:17:24.211]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[02:17:25.032 --> 02:17:26.012]  It's America first.
[02:17:26.352 --> 02:17:30.754]  Our military, our borders, our everything, that's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[02:17:31.195 --> 02:17:33.155]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[02:17:33.636 --> 02:17:34.116]  Democrat,
[02:17:35.276 --> 02:17:40.578]  Appellate court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[02:17:41.098 --> 02:17:42.219]  They hate flyover country.
[02:17:42.379 --> 02:17:43.319]  They hate bitter clingers.
[02:17:43.839 --> 02:17:45.260]  The universities hate America.
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:46.260]  They hate free speech.
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:48.441]  They're the party of globalism.
[02:17:48.761 --> 02:17:50.601]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[02:17:50.841 --> 02:17:56.944]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[02:17:57.164 --> 02:17:58.104]  It's all in the WikiLeaks!
[02:17:58.444 --> 02:17:59.725]  They're the ones of fake news.
[02:17:59.785 --> 02:18:01.125]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[02:18:01.186 --> 02:18:04.547]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[02:18:04.587 --> 02:18:10.771]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[02:18:11.151 --> 02:18:11.831]  They're the enemy.
[02:18:12.572 --> 02:18:25.519]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be
[02:18:25.859 --> 02:18:26.900]  Meeting with him and talking to him?
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.260]  That he's a traitor?
[02:18:28.741 --> 02:18:30.762]  And that the military needs to remove him?
[02:18:31.402 --> 02:18:33.603]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[02:18:34.504 --> 02:18:37.285]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[02:18:37.666 --> 02:18:38.706]  They openly admit it!
[02:18:39.146 --> 02:18:40.607]  They are the clear and present danger.
[02:18:40.947 --> 02:18:41.748]  They're the globalists.
[02:18:41.808 --> 02:18:42.608]  They're the deep state.
[02:18:42.908 --> 02:18:47.891]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[02:18:48.171 --> 02:18:49.592]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[02:18:49.872 --> 02:18:50.873]  We're sovereign.
[02:18:51.133 --> 02:18:52.514]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[02:18:53.374 --> 02:18:54.815]  Russia has the same enemy as us.
[02:18:55.715 --> 02:18:56.355]  George Soros.
[02:18:56.375 --> 02:19:05.198]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does that make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[02:19:05.538 --> 02:19:08.880]  It's the multinationals working with the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:12.241]  It's Hollywood owned by the shycoms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[02:19:12.601 --> 02:19:14.021]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[02:19:14.382 --> 02:19:16.542]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[02:19:16.902 --> 02:19:17.503]  But they're not.
[02:19:17.903 --> 02:19:20.444]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[02:19:21.304 --> 02:19:23.946]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[02:19:24.627 --> 02:19:30.872]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[02:19:31.092 --> 02:19:31.893]  And so is Trump.
[02:19:32.213 --> 02:19:36.156]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[02:19:36.377 --> 02:19:39.679]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:43.523]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[02:19:43.863 --> 02:19:45.784]  They are the threat to this nation.
[02:19:46.865 --> 02:19:50.148]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[02:19:50.668 --> 02:19:53.790]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[02:19:54.311 --> 02:19:55.191]  The year is 2018.
[02:19:56.072 --> 02:19:56.933]  History's happening now.
[02:19:57.393 --> 02:19:58.894]  Choose which side you're on.
[02:20:05.839 --> 02:20:08.501]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:23.641]  When I first got involved, 27 years ago.
[02:20:24.041 --> 02:20:25.641]  Been on there about 23 years now.
[02:20:26.521 --> 02:20:29.242]  Hard to believe, almost 25 actually.
[02:20:29.262 --> 02:20:29.542]  24, God.
[02:20:31.062 --> 02:20:38.584]  I wasn't like bragging, oh I was like going to meetings with like, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, multi-star Marine Corps Generals.
[02:20:39.084 --> 02:20:44.765]  When I first got on air, I'd have like routinely, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore on.
[02:20:45.485 --> 02:20:49.086]  And you think, you think I'm saying all this, he would say all this on air.
[02:20:50.316 --> 02:21:01.068]  And the point was, even though those guys, judge, advocate, generals, you name it, I had them all on, even though they were so high-powered, they couldn't get it published anywhere.
[02:21:02.455 --> 02:21:05.716]  I mean, you talked about world government, the CFR, 25 years ago.
[02:21:06.636 --> 02:21:08.576]  There was no coverage where they call you anti-Semitic.
[02:21:08.616 --> 02:21:10.136]  I'm like, what does it have to do with anti-Semites?
[02:21:10.797 --> 02:21:11.477]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:21:11.497 --> 02:21:13.217]  It's like calling Trump anti-Semitic.
[02:21:13.237 --> 02:21:16.238]  You see, like, Rob Reiner, Trump is anti-Semitic!
[02:21:16.278 --> 02:21:18.338]  It's like, moving the U.S.
[02:21:18.498 --> 02:21:20.318]  Embassy to Jerusalem?
[02:21:20.818 --> 02:21:23.319]  His daughter's married to Orthodox Jews?
[02:21:28.380 --> 02:21:29.620]  Again, none of it's even real.
[02:21:31.403 --> 02:21:33.324]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:21:34.344 --> 02:21:35.445]  Think of what we've got now.
[02:21:35.485 --> 02:21:36.725]  World government's been exposed.
[02:21:38.026 --> 02:21:43.768]  The plan for planetary government, the eugenics program, the depopulation program, that's all been exposed.
[02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:50.451]  The plan under UNESCO to get rid of genders, the whole Brave New World operation.
[02:21:51.926 --> 02:22:01.613]  We are so far along now in being proven right, but they could flip it and make it where, well, no one cares anymore.
[02:22:01.793 --> 02:22:03.254]  Okay, you were proven right, let's just move on.
[02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:03.995]  No.
[02:22:06.277 --> 02:22:13.362]  You know, I said we're having a special guest on, but I promised to go to these calls, so let's get Alexander on the last segment in five minutes, the next hour, because I've got to take calls this segment and the next.
[02:22:13.402 --> 02:22:14.363]  I've got to get to all these people.
[02:22:14.743 --> 02:22:16.564]  Billy in Indiana, I really appreciate you holding.
[02:22:16.604 --> 02:22:17.525]  I thank you for holding.
[02:22:17.545 --> 02:22:19.146]  I appreciate that.
[02:22:19.186 --> 02:22:19.627]  You're on the air.
[02:22:19.667 --> 02:22:19.967]  Go ahead.
[02:22:21.665 --> 02:22:24.487]  Yeah, first time caller here, just wanted to say hello.
[02:22:25.148 --> 02:22:26.088]  Long time listener.
[02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:33.273]  I guess my biggest thing would be, I want to know really why the president doesn't just start firing some of these people.
[02:22:33.353 --> 02:22:36.896]  I mean, the majority of Americans are behind him and they clearly show him.
[02:22:40.273 --> 02:22:47.156]  He's so innocent that he just thinks it's dumb and they keep lying to him as lawyers that he's finally fired, telling him everything's okay.
[02:22:47.216 --> 02:22:47.616]  I agree.
[02:22:47.676 --> 02:22:59.161]  They could steal the election in three months and they're going to start impeachment if he, just like Lionel, who used to be a Democrat, he supports Trump now because he's a patriot, he has to move now.
[02:22:59.221 --> 02:23:00.161]  They've committed the crimes.
[02:23:00.502 --> 02:23:02.022]  It's dereliction of duty if he doesn't.
[02:23:02.843 --> 02:23:08.405]  But you understand, cutting off their security clearances, they're using those to communicate with their operatives.
[02:23:09.719 --> 02:23:11.861]  They're sleeper cells that they embedded.
[02:23:12.042 --> 02:23:17.928]  They've been on the news saying they put thousands of their people in to block the Make America Great Again agenda.
[02:23:18.208 --> 02:23:25.096]  Can you imagine when Trump's only got 20% control, 30% control maybe now, of the executive and everything's already turned around like halfway.
[02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:28.059]  Can you imagine if we actually had him as the executive what would happen?
[02:23:29.645 --> 02:23:30.486]  Oh, it would be amazing.
[02:23:30.526 --> 02:23:33.290]  I mean, the country would change around in no time at all.
[02:23:33.450 --> 02:23:35.032]  Yeah, we already had half the world's wealth.
[02:23:35.072 --> 02:23:35.853]  We are it.
[02:23:36.434 --> 02:23:37.536]  Because we had that freedom.
[02:23:37.556 --> 02:23:38.297]  We were a Christian.
[02:23:38.417 --> 02:23:38.897]  Exactly.
[02:23:39.278 --> 02:23:40.199]  So, they're pissed.
[02:23:40.219 --> 02:23:40.840]  Can you imagine?
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.944]  They know if he can... Look, if you read British government stuff...
[02:23:44.724 --> 02:23:49.988]  From 200 years ago, before the 1812 war, they said the American system's too successful.
[02:23:50.349 --> 02:23:51.950]  If it's successful, it'll kill monarchy.
[02:23:51.970 --> 02:23:57.234]  Well, that means it'll kill plutocracy or oligarchy or banker monopoly.
[02:23:57.655 --> 02:24:00.017]  They cannot have you turned loose, brother.
[02:24:00.237 --> 02:24:01.278]  You're too powerful.
[02:24:03.223 --> 02:24:04.304]  Absolutely, I agree.
[02:24:04.544 --> 02:24:06.105]  And I just want to put one more plug, Alex.
[02:24:06.125 --> 02:24:16.310]  You don't see any of that crazy stuff here in Indiana with all these people going crazy and taking people's hats and spitting on them and stuff, because I'm telling you, that wouldn't apply here in Indiana, because we wish somebody would over here.
[02:24:17.446 --> 02:24:29.854]  I know the Midwest is on fire, and that's why they hate you so much, because it's just, it's good, whether they're white, Hispanic, old, young, they came here to work and be farmers, and they're just real unassuming.
[02:24:29.914 --> 02:24:40.261]  The vibe, I was just in Omaha, and all those German and Polish and Irish and Italian immigrants, and it just, the vibe was just so serene, and, but the problem is,
[02:24:41.181 --> 02:24:42.703]  They're all serene and calm.
[02:24:42.803 --> 02:24:44.084]  They don't know they're under attack.
[02:24:44.484 --> 02:24:45.906]  We've got to get those people moving.
[02:24:45.946 --> 02:24:46.826]  So yes, I agree.
[02:24:47.307 --> 02:24:48.888]  In the Midwest, that's what the globalists hate.
[02:24:48.928 --> 02:24:49.849]  Spiritually, they hate you.
[02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:51.731]  Because you're confident.
[02:24:51.931 --> 02:24:53.312]  You don't want their elitism.
[02:24:54.053 --> 02:24:54.714]  They hate you.
[02:24:54.814 --> 02:24:56.776]  So how do I get the Midwest to get in the fight?
[02:24:58.496 --> 02:25:04.382]  Well, I mean, I would absolutely say, I mean, at least where I'm at, Alex, you have a huge following here, whether you know it or not.
[02:25:04.682 --> 02:25:06.684]  No, no, I was in, I was mobbed in Omaha.
[02:25:06.724 --> 02:25:07.304]  I was mobbed.
[02:25:07.525 --> 02:25:09.827]  But what I'm saying is, all of you should start YouTube channels.
[02:25:10.207 --> 02:25:11.769]  All of you should start talk radio shows.
[02:25:12.029 --> 02:25:12.709]  It's not me.
[02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:13.150]  You understand?
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:14.912]  I am crap compared to you.
[02:25:15.572 --> 02:25:19.276]  Compared to all the men and women listening out there, I am nothing.
[02:25:19.316 --> 02:25:19.676]  You understand?
[02:25:19.716 --> 02:25:21.498]  I'm only here to tell you how strong you are.
[02:25:22.754 --> 02:25:28.065]  Absolutely, but I mean, you should also know too, there's tons of other YouTube channels that they censor all the time.
[02:25:29.147 --> 02:25:31.070]  So launch more, go on Mike Adams' platform.
[02:25:31.111 --> 02:25:32.814]  I'll just say this, I don't say this to have a death wish.
[02:25:32.894 --> 02:25:33.335]  I want to live to be 100.
[02:25:34.775 --> 02:25:37.237]  Don't let them if they destroy me or kill me soon.
[02:25:38.017 --> 02:25:39.258]  Don't think of that as a defeat.
[02:25:39.859 --> 02:25:42.781]  Just think of it as a victory and how much stronger you're going to be.
[02:25:42.821 --> 02:25:43.781]  They can't silence you.
[02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:46.443]  I want everybody to understand, I've chosen what I've done.
[02:25:46.863 --> 02:25:50.906]  But you have to understand the beautiful person you are, Billy.
[02:25:51.567 --> 02:25:52.147]  God bless you.
[02:25:52.207 --> 02:25:53.528]  David in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:25:53.548 --> 02:25:54.108]  Thanks for holding.
[02:25:54.128 --> 02:25:54.849]  Go ahead, David.
[02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:56.510]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:57.251 --> 02:25:57.531]  Welcome.
[02:25:58.532 --> 02:26:02.895]  Mr. Jones, calling in from the liberal state of Connecticut.
[02:26:04.485 --> 02:26:09.007]  Just want to say thank you for everything that you do.
[02:26:09.407 --> 02:26:14.709]  Being a voice that nobody wants to hear is always pushed down.
[02:26:15.529 --> 02:26:22.712]  You know, there's a lot of topics out there that are real topics and you're the voice that
[02:26:25.795 --> 02:26:28.996]  That needs to be heard, that everybody's afraid to... Well, let me be clear.
[02:26:30.117 --> 02:26:33.638]  And listen, I say this to every caller that says it because it's the truth.
[02:26:34.178 --> 02:26:35.779]  The mindset is you've got to flip this.
[02:26:36.299 --> 02:26:38.200]  Thank you for your brotherhood, your kinship.
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:39.060]  I feel it, brother.
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.400]  I love you.
[02:26:40.801 --> 02:26:42.661]  But listen, don't thank me.
[02:26:42.781 --> 02:26:43.542]  I'm like a person...
[02:26:44.642 --> 02:26:48.083]  Trapped in a ship sinking, and I'm trying to get my family out to get oxygen.
[02:26:48.483 --> 02:26:49.543]  I'm doing this to survive.
[02:26:49.583 --> 02:26:50.504]  This is normal.
[02:26:51.284 --> 02:26:56.185]  So don't think of it as some exemplary thing that I'm up here standing against these people.
[02:26:56.245 --> 02:26:57.925]  There's no way but through them.
[02:26:58.426 --> 02:26:59.706]  I don't want to take on Mueller.
[02:26:59.806 --> 02:27:00.966]  I don't want to take on Hillary.
[02:27:01.306 --> 02:27:02.607]  I don't want them to do these things.
[02:27:02.687 --> 02:27:03.987]  I don't want to put my kids on the line.
[02:27:04.067 --> 02:27:06.888]  But I'm gonna lose them anyways, brother, if I don't do this.
[02:27:06.908 --> 02:27:09.768]  You understand, like, I want everybody to know there's a point of no return.
[02:27:10.008 --> 02:27:11.989]  There's nothing left to lose but everything.
[02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:16.530]  There's nothing to do but get right with God and take action.
[02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:17.230]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:19.431]  I totally agree.
[02:27:19.591 --> 02:27:25.272]  They're pumping all that transgender stuff to our kids up here and it's a horrible thing.
[02:27:25.352 --> 02:27:29.713]  Mainline public schools are sexualizing your children nationwide.
[02:27:31.273 --> 02:27:31.794]  Exactly.
[02:27:33.234 --> 02:27:33.554]  No!
[02:27:35.694 --> 02:27:42.056]  There's nothing more powerful to a kid, to an awkward kid that doesn't have many friends,
[02:27:42.543 --> 02:27:47.206]  Then to turn to this, that's already been ceded to them in schools, you know.
[02:27:47.286 --> 02:27:49.268]  And if you go back 20 years ago, 10 years ago, well 20 years ago,
[02:28:02.507 --> 02:28:09.412]  You might have DCF knocking on your door, talking about your son's addresses or something of that nature.
[02:28:09.532 --> 02:28:10.153]  Well, exactly.
[02:28:10.393 --> 02:28:11.333]  How this works is this.
[02:28:11.934 --> 02:28:16.657]  First, they put him in dresses, but really, they want a genderless system.
[02:28:18.351 --> 02:28:21.413]  How do you think everything rests on Brave New World?
[02:28:21.613 --> 02:28:24.255]  He was a top family in England, the Huxleys.
[02:28:24.535 --> 02:28:25.656]  His brother ran the U.N.
[02:28:25.696 --> 02:28:27.477]  He was the head eugenicist, head transhumanist.
[02:28:27.917 --> 02:28:30.979]  He wrote what his brother told him, the M.I.O.S.S.
[02:28:31.019 --> 02:28:33.201]  plan, that M.I.6 plan was.
[02:28:34.682 --> 02:28:35.883]  And so, that's it.
[02:28:36.063 --> 02:28:41.246]  This is a scientific plan to literally fry our children's brains.
[02:28:41.646 --> 02:28:45.829]  And transgenders have the highest suicide rate there is out there because they've been preyed on.
[02:28:45.869 --> 02:28:46.810]  They're not the bad people.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:50.021]  It's the system doing this to people.
[02:28:50.881 --> 02:28:53.902]  There's always been men raised by women that felt feminine and everything.
[02:28:54.282 --> 02:28:55.363]  Humans have both aspects.
[02:28:55.403 --> 02:28:56.443]  We're not attacking those people.
[02:28:56.763 --> 02:28:58.504]  It's that it's artificially being projected.
[02:28:58.524 --> 02:28:59.084]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:02.705 --> 02:29:13.549]  Any student of military history, in all of recorded time, will tell you that stealth and sneak attack is absolutely critical in any offensive war.
[02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:31.924]  The Democrats, the CHICOM's funding them, Hollywood, the whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[02:29:32.704 --> 02:29:33.625]  NATO is their army.
[02:29:34.125 --> 02:29:37.428]  Right now, the Democrats are making their move.
[02:29:38.407 --> 02:29:47.214]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the president using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[02:29:47.734 --> 02:29:55.601]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[02:29:55.901 --> 02:30:00.604]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[02:30:01.485 --> 02:30:14.311]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[02:30:14.731 --> 02:30:25.776]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[02:30:26.616 --> 02:30:29.578]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[02:30:29.998 --> 02:30:35.342]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[02:30:35.782 --> 02:30:37.603]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[02:30:37.923 --> 02:30:42.266]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:45.948]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:49.731]  But you could see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[02:30:50.231 --> 02:30:52.434]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[02:30:52.474 --> 02:30:54.116]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[02:30:54.316 --> 02:30:55.537]  The economy's turning around.
[02:30:55.918 --> 02:31:02.085]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[02:31:02.425 --> 02:31:05.048]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[02:31:05.729 --> 02:31:06.850]  All the things Trump's killed.
[02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:14.738]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[02:31:14.958 --> 02:31:16.520]  He's acting as our real president.
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:19.443]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[02:31:19.743 --> 02:31:20.984]  He really is the president now.
[02:31:21.365 --> 02:31:28.472]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood thought they had this country.
[02:31:28.812 --> 02:31:34.033]  The Communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[02:31:34.313 --> 02:31:35.173]  They're the big threat.
[02:31:35.693 --> 02:31:38.014]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[02:31:38.314 --> 02:31:40.614]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[02:31:41.135 --> 02:31:45.896]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[02:31:46.376 --> 02:31:48.516]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[02:31:48.796 --> 02:31:52.077]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[02:31:52.697 --> 02:31:59.706]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk before they finally make their move.
[02:32:00.066 --> 02:32:05.634]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[02:32:05.694 --> 02:32:07.336]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[02:32:07.616 --> 02:32:08.617]  They admit they're doing it.
[02:32:08.978 --> 02:32:09.879]  They are the globalists.
[02:32:09.939 --> 02:32:10.560]  They are the enemy.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:25.634]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[02:32:26.075 --> 02:32:34.523]  This is a war against America trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[02:32:34.983 --> 02:32:35.604]  We're good to go.
[02:33:06.849 --> 02:33:09.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.956 --> 02:33:33.588]  Alright, I want to take a bunch of your calls ahead of a special guest joining us, and I'm just going to leave it at this.
[02:33:34.009 --> 02:33:35.550]  We did not get rid of yesterday's special.
[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:40.771]  I haven't done new specials yet.
[02:33:40.791 --> 02:33:42.332]  67% off, 50% off the lowest special.
[02:33:42.352 --> 02:33:44.332]  A lot of those are at cost.
[02:33:44.873 --> 02:33:45.813]  They're great products, man.
[02:33:45.853 --> 02:33:51.155]  If you just use them, like the X2 or the Rainforge, you'll see how great they are, the Make America Coffee.
[02:33:52.415 --> 02:33:54.516]  I mean, they sell the same stuff at Whole Foods.
[02:33:54.556 --> 02:33:56.016]  I get it from the Chiapas Farmers.
[02:33:56.136 --> 02:33:58.037]  It's like right on the border with Guatemala.
[02:33:58.857 --> 02:34:00.818]  They sell it for $5 more at Whole Foods.
[02:34:05.376 --> 02:34:08.400]  You know, we sell it and make like $6 a bag on the one pound bags.
[02:34:09.641 --> 02:34:10.722]  It's really just great coffee.
[02:34:10.742 --> 02:34:12.484]  Something you want to reorder every month.
[02:34:13.305 --> 02:34:17.891]  But if you just think about us and fund us, we won't have to worry about this and we can move forward to the future.
[02:34:18.291 --> 02:34:20.894]  Let me just go back and I'm going to your calls and talk about something here.
[02:34:21.876 --> 02:34:23.538]  When I talk about how 25, 26, 27 years ago,
[02:34:27.319 --> 02:34:36.143]  I was involved in the Liberty Movement for the pro-Second Amendment property rights because I'd gone to community college ahead of paying money for a big college.
[02:34:36.383 --> 02:34:44.747]  I could have got into UT and had the grades and all the rest of it, but I just wanted to go to community college so I could keep the jobs.
[02:34:44.787 --> 02:34:48.709]  I had two jobs as a salesman and also as a dental hygienist at that time.
[02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:50.910]  Before that, I worked at a golf course.
[02:34:50.930 --> 02:34:53.332]  I had a lot of jobs.
[02:34:55.208 --> 02:35:01.074]  I'd already read, let's not exaggerate, 500 history books or so, and a lot of timeline books about things.
[02:35:01.094 --> 02:35:01.855]  I already knew a lot.
[02:35:02.956 --> 02:35:08.682]  So when I went to college and heard all this anti-American, anti-human, race-baiting garbage, I knew that was authoritarian.
[02:35:09.203 --> 02:35:13.107]  And then when I got invited, because I went to some pro-Second Amendment rallies and things,
[02:35:14.448 --> 02:35:14.648]  I don't
[02:35:33.570 --> 02:35:38.693]  Major generals and stuff, and I'm like, these people were running all over the country warning everybody.
[02:35:39.033 --> 02:35:40.454]  They weren't even selling books.
[02:35:41.395 --> 02:35:52.842]  In the case of Benton Parton and Roy and Admiral Moore, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and I'm like, you know, you walk into some little restaurant, there's 30 people there, and there's the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[02:35:54.039 --> 02:35:56.363]  You know, who ran nerve gas attacks on the North and stuff.
[02:35:56.383 --> 02:35:57.886]  I mean, this is not like a candy ash.
[02:35:58.307 --> 02:36:04.217]  And he's warning about world government to plan to overthrow America, and he's some 87-year-old dude up there, and he wasn't senile at all.
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:08.382]  You realize, man, something serious going on here.
[02:36:08.523 --> 02:36:10.645]  And I talk about seeds.
[02:36:11.366 --> 02:36:19.515]  Think how far we've come from nobody knowing this stuff 30 years ago to now we are taking the planet back and the enemy is on their heels.
[02:36:19.955 --> 02:36:21.137]  That's why we should be celebrating.
[02:36:21.197 --> 02:36:23.960]  But the enemy is going to strike back is what I'm saying.
[02:36:25.161 --> 02:36:25.442]  And so
[02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:42.575]  I remember my uncle, my mom's brother, who never even talked about this, my grandma talked about how highly decorated he was in Vietnam and then he was super humble Christian and drove a bread truck in San Antonio and I remember we dug into his chest and it was like,
[02:36:43.507 --> 02:36:46.669]  I remember talking to one of the guys in the Army, I said, you know somebody that has seven Silver Stars?
[02:36:46.689 --> 02:36:47.990]  They're like, no, we don't know anybody that has those.
[02:36:48.531 --> 02:36:50.953]  But they couldn't do Congressional Medal of Honors, because then it would be on the news.
[02:36:51.313 --> 02:36:58.018]  He ran black ops in Laos, Cambodia, helicopter missions, all these stuff in Central America, South America, all this other stuff as an Army officer.
[02:36:58.619 --> 02:37:03.863]  When he had his funeral a few years ago, they had his Army buddies up there talking about, oh, it's a 25-year career in the Army.
[02:37:03.883 --> 02:37:05.404]  And my parents were like, they knew about it.
[02:37:05.424 --> 02:37:07.826]  They were looking at me like, I was in the Army five years.
[02:37:08.246 --> 02:37:10.768]  And it's like, all those people that did that type of stuff.
[02:37:10.808 --> 02:37:13.130]  And I remember my uncle, William Forrest Hammond,
[02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:20.912]  He was telling me how the whole world really worked when I'd go down there and spend a week in San Antonio.
[02:37:20.932 --> 02:37:39.159]  And he'd say, he'd just lean over and he'd say something like, because he'd get back at like, you know, noon after working all night driving a bread truck, and I'd say, you're a pilot, a jet pilot, helicopter pilot, you've got, you've got degrees, you were, you know, you know, starring, you know, guy on the football team at LSU.
[02:37:39.199 --> 02:37:42.220]  Why do you, he said, well, this is just a humble job I want to do.
[02:37:43.533 --> 02:37:49.317]  And I remember before he died, I said, what made you down in Guatemala turn against the system?
[02:37:50.558 --> 02:37:59.244]  But I remember picking him up in Dallas at an Air Force base, you know, their jeep had been blown up in Guatemala, whatever, whenever he got out of the government and everything, and his partner got killed.
[02:38:00.125 --> 02:38:07.731]  And he said, Alex, there's always a level of evil and a point you won't go along with, forever claim of good, they say.
[02:38:07.751 --> 02:38:08.551]  And I said, well, what was it?
[02:38:08.571 --> 02:38:10.653]  He said, well, I can't tell you, but the children.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:26.950]  I said what he said the orphanages what they were doing to the children in the orphanages in Guatemala and I said he goes I can't tell you and so you know it's like
[02:38:31.294 --> 02:38:33.655]  At the bottom of this rabbit hole is abuse of children.
[02:38:34.495 --> 02:38:36.276]  The whole thing is about hurting children.
[02:38:36.596 --> 02:38:42.699]  Because children are innocent, they're close to God, and if they can torture children and hurt children, they get everything.
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:48.941]  And most of the guys he knew in the government became Christians.
[02:38:50.122 --> 02:38:59.546]  Because they were in the middle of this and saw evil, and there are no atheists in foxholes, and that's the enemy's problem is, that's why they want machines running everything, is because
[02:39:01.650 --> 02:39:12.232]  People that are lied to and get compartmentalized into things and do things that are corrupt because they're ordered to and it's for a greater good, they think, they finally come up to grips with the real evil.
[02:39:17.974 --> 02:39:18.834]  And they won't do it anymore.
[02:39:21.274 --> 02:39:28.796]  And so he told me, he said, yeah, most of the guys we serve with, most people that were in Latin America doing things after that, he said they almost all became Christians because
[02:39:32.648 --> 02:39:37.212]  He told my mom how they would like take LSD and fly helicopters into combat and stuff, you know, all the rest of it.
[02:39:37.492 --> 02:39:40.254]  So this was, this is how I listened to Jimi Hendrix taking LSD, flying helicopters.
[02:39:40.274 --> 02:39:42.256]  You know, this wasn't like Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[02:39:42.276 --> 02:39:47.641]  And then he saw stuff so bad in Latin America that he became absolutely born again.
[02:39:48.741 --> 02:39:49.522]  And that's what we're fighting.
[02:39:51.224 --> 02:39:54.066]  He told me, he said, pedophiles rule the world, Alex.
[02:39:58.976 --> 02:40:03.018]  And he was let in on the thing they were about to move against Obama five years ago.
[02:40:04.539 --> 02:40:05.399]  He was let in on that.
[02:40:09.321 --> 02:40:11.262]  And then a bunch of those people died just like that.
[02:40:13.143 --> 02:40:13.483]  All dead.
[02:40:14.584 --> 02:40:14.844]  One week.
[02:40:15.744 --> 02:40:16.285]  All over the country.
[02:40:16.925 --> 02:40:17.125]  Dead.
[02:40:18.206 --> 02:40:21.087]  So that's kind of the backstory of the war that's going on here.
[02:40:21.647 --> 02:40:22.668]  This war is big.
[02:40:22.728 --> 02:40:23.488]  This war is deep.
[02:40:23.728 --> 02:40:24.529]  This war is long.
[02:40:25.401 --> 02:40:28.404]  But ask yourselves, do you support torturing children to death?
[02:40:28.984 --> 02:40:35.190]  Because if you serve Hillary and the Globalists and Mueller, you are signed on to that and never forget it.
[02:40:38.953 --> 02:40:40.374]  Got an Anthroplex testimonial.
[02:40:41.195 --> 02:40:44.918]  We've got questions on Beef Shapiro, InfoWars version of Proud Boys.
[02:40:45.178 --> 02:40:46.900]  Let's talk to Mike in Massachusetts.
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:47.701]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:40:47.721 --> 02:40:48.061]  Go ahead.
[02:40:50.223 --> 02:40:51.064]  Great to talk to you.
[02:40:51.904 --> 02:40:52.245]  Welcome.
[02:40:52.265 --> 02:40:52.525]  Go ahead.
[02:40:53.427 --> 02:40:55.828]  First, I got a couple of plugs I want to make, and then I have a couple of points.
[02:40:56.428 --> 02:41:00.249]  I've been taking the Survival Shield and the Selenium for at least a year now, and they're both great.
[02:41:00.909 --> 02:41:02.369]  I also want to mention the app.
[02:41:02.409 --> 02:41:06.490]  If anybody hasn't gotten it yet, you should definitely get it, because it is way better than the last app.
[02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:08.531]  It's a really great app.
[02:41:08.951 --> 02:41:10.131]  The last plug is for your beard.
[02:41:10.632 --> 02:41:11.572]  Keep the beard, Alex.
[02:41:11.632 --> 02:41:12.252]  Don't get rid of it.
[02:41:12.312 --> 02:41:13.152]  I'm telling you, keep it.
[02:41:13.192 --> 02:41:15.693]  Well, it's not itching now, but I'm going to get it trimmed today, actually.
[02:41:16.913 --> 02:41:17.973]  I know they get itchy, but keep it.
[02:41:17.993 --> 02:41:18.994]  I'm telling you, it treats you well.
[02:41:20.353 --> 02:41:30.397]  One thing that I saw on the Infowars.com site that I didn't hear you talk about yet, maybe I just missed it, is Dr. Shiva Ayodhuri getting assaulted in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
[02:41:30.457 --> 02:41:31.258]  I was with him that day.
[02:41:31.278 --> 02:41:33.419]  I was actually the guy that... Yeah, we covered it.
[02:41:33.459 --> 02:41:36.840]  Like, Weird Lepus comes up and punches him and knocks the thing into his mouth, and yeah.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:39.501]  Right, yeah, I was the guy that tackled him.
[02:41:39.521 --> 02:41:42.583]  But to give the police credit, usually they let Antifa attack people.
[02:41:42.623 --> 02:41:43.363]  This time they arrested him.
[02:41:44.414 --> 02:41:46.415]  Yeah, they did arrest him this time, which was good.
[02:41:47.716 --> 02:41:51.298]  And it was... Sheba is an absolute savage.
[02:41:51.918 --> 02:41:57.661]  He goes out there, he follows Elizabeth Warren around, he gives the racist stuff right back to the liberals.
[02:41:57.701 --> 02:42:01.423]  And when he does, you look at him in line, and they're not really sure how to take it.
[02:42:01.483 --> 02:42:08.726]  Some are confused, some kind of look like those rusty wheels are starting to turn a little bit, and others just kind of get enraged, like the guy that attacked them.
[02:42:08.746 --> 02:42:13.629]  But yeah, if we can get more people, if anybody's listening in Massachusetts,
[02:42:14.096 --> 02:42:14.897]  Get a hold of Shiva.
[02:42:14.937 --> 02:42:19.281]  Get a hold of any candidate that is out there that might be pro-Trump.
[02:42:19.441 --> 02:42:20.162]  Small government.
[02:42:20.222 --> 02:42:20.823]  Get a hold of them.
[02:42:20.843 --> 02:42:21.644]  They will talk to you.
[02:42:21.664 --> 02:42:24.466]  You can get a hold of them on Facebook, and they'll definitely talk to you.
[02:42:24.506 --> 02:42:25.307]  They'll give you signs.
[02:42:25.327 --> 02:42:26.328]  Put a sign in your yard.
[02:42:26.348 --> 02:42:27.409]  Stand on a corner.
[02:42:27.449 --> 02:42:27.990]  Hold a sign.
[02:42:28.010 --> 02:42:29.331]  You've got to get out there and help.
[02:42:30.092 --> 02:42:37.039]  The next thing I want to talk about is, now, the last caller, Billy, the first caller, Billy, he asked,
[02:42:37.719 --> 02:42:38.600]  How to get in the fight?
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:43.824]  Well, Alex, I think it's time to have a InfoWars version of Proud Boys.
[02:42:44.165 --> 02:42:52.532]  You have a very large base of InfoWarriors, and I think that it would be something that could blow off.
[02:42:52.812 --> 02:42:55.635]  But how do I stop Infiltrators getting in it and triggering violence?
[02:42:55.675 --> 02:42:57.656]  Because they already say I'm for violence, even aren't.
[02:42:57.676 --> 02:42:58.597]  But we'll talk more about it.
[02:42:58.617 --> 02:43:00.479]  We've got a special guest coming up and more calls in.
[02:43:00.519 --> 02:43:01.400]  Paul Watson, stay with us.
[02:43:02.956 --> 02:43:07.098]  This country is now officially in a state of civil war.
[02:43:07.878 --> 02:43:15.901]  Multiple members of Congress, rabid Democrats, have called for a military coup against President Donald J. Trump.
[02:43:16.321 --> 02:43:25.324]  We also have former Deputy Director of the FBI and Deputy Director of the CIA coming out and calling for the, quote, deep state to remove the President.
[02:43:26.184 --> 02:43:33.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you saw that going on in Russia, our news media would accurately say that they were in a state of civil war.
[02:43:33.930 --> 02:43:37.432]  If you saw that happening in the EU, that would be an accurate assumption.
[02:43:37.893 --> 02:43:44.758]  Even a few weeks ago, USA Today interviewed professors that said they believe we were already in the early stages of a civil war.
[02:43:45.678 --> 02:43:55.442]  I have been ridiculed for pointing out the Democrats the last year and a half were quietly planning it in their own policy papers funded by George Soros and others.
[02:43:55.783 --> 02:43:59.584]  But now it's out in the open and this country is in maximum danger.
[02:44:00.205 --> 02:44:07.448]  They are trying to induce Trump derangement syndrome onto CNN and MSNBC and NPR audiences.
[02:44:08.328 --> 02:44:25.565]  To believe the hysteria that Russia wants to build walls, that Russia wants to expand our military, that Russia wants to bring our economy back, that Russia wants to devastate its own oil and gas imports as Trump has done, that Russia wants Trump to ship anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to attack Russians?
[02:44:26.286 --> 02:44:31.350]  The truth is, Trump's been too hardcore on Russia, because Russia hasn't done anything to the U.S.
[02:44:31.851 --> 02:44:37.896]  It's the communist Chinese that are on record owning Hollywood, owning our national debt, and trying to basically break this country up.
[02:44:38.176 --> 02:44:39.497]  They're allied with the Democrats.
[02:44:39.817 --> 02:44:40.638]  They're the real traitors.
[02:44:41.058 --> 02:44:52.468]  That's why Congressman Stephen Cohen has called for a military coup against the president, because he is a traitor, working with the chi-coms, working with the multinational corporations.
[02:44:52.828 --> 02:45:01.114]  That's why Phil Mudd of the CIA and the FBI has come out on CNN just last night and said Trump is a traitor.
[02:45:01.174 --> 02:45:09.280]  He needs to be overthrown for meeting with the Russian leader and being nice, at least in the things he said, but not in Trump's actions.
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:10.061]  It's incredible.
[02:45:10.481 --> 02:45:19.544]  And then we've got, of course, Rabbid Wolf Blitzer attacking Senator Rand Paul for pointing out that Trump's just trying to stop a new Cold War from taking place.
[02:45:19.584 --> 02:45:27.246]  And then former CIA Director Brennan, who's a Wahhabi-ist, who was an admitted communist in college, voted as a communist after he was in college.
[02:45:27.766 --> 02:45:33.108]  This anti-American piece of garbage has been caught illegally spying on the president back when he was in the campaign.
[02:45:33.148 --> 02:45:35.929]  Then once he was president-elect, he's been caught lying to Congress.
[02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:39.670]  This guy is saying that Trump is treasonous.
[02:45:40.470 --> 02:45:43.216]  And that Trump needs to be politically paralyzed and removed.
[02:45:43.697 --> 02:45:44.258]  They want...
[02:45:45.736 --> 02:45:51.459]  The 25th Amendment invoked, and they're calling for people inside Trump's cabinet to call for him to be removed.
[02:45:51.819 --> 02:45:53.800]  This isn't just a civil war they've kicked off.
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:46:08.507]  It is an attempted coup that is in plain view, and the public and everyone else must respond by calling Congress, calling the President, and calling other individuals in our government and telling them, stand by the election, stand by the voters, stand by the Republic.
[02:46:08.867 --> 02:46:10.368]  My goodness, the country's coming back.
[02:46:10.488 --> 02:46:11.669]  So many great things are happening.
[02:46:11.869 --> 02:46:14.590]  We're making the nation great again, and these traitors can't stand it.
[02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:17.934]  That said, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack as well.
[02:46:18.375 --> 02:46:21.939]  As you see thousands of articles a week saying, shut us down, take us off the air.
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:30.270]  Without you spreading the word, the articles, the videos, without you buying products at InfoWarsStore.com, they will defeat us as a key outpost in the fight against globalism.
[02:46:30.350 --> 02:46:31.070]  Spread the articles.
[02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:32.011]  Spread the videos.
[02:46:32.251 --> 02:46:36.734]  Subscribe to the new official InfoWars app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:46:36.754 --> 02:46:37.815]  Sign up for our free newsletter.
[02:46:38.175 --> 02:46:42.337]  Spread our articles to everyone you know continually as an act of resistance against the globalists.
[02:46:42.478 --> 02:46:50.843]  And financially buy the equivalent of Information Warfare war bonds at InfoWarsStore.com when you buy products that will empower you and your family.
[02:46:50.903 --> 02:46:54.385]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've backed InfoWars for more than 20 years and I want to thank you all.
[02:46:54.625 --> 02:47:00.233]  But now it's more critical than ever to go to InfoWarStore.com and support the Info War while getting great products.
[02:47:00.494 --> 02:47:01.335]  God bless you all.
[02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:09.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.042 --> 02:47:27.963]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:28.423 --> 02:47:30.804]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:33.485 --> 02:47:40.167]  Alexander is a very successful Republican patriot analyst and consultant.
[02:47:40.447 --> 02:47:41.287]  Worked with Trump in 2016.
[02:47:42.227 --> 02:47:45.228]  And the last year he's gone public because he knows the culture war is so intense.
[02:47:45.248 --> 02:47:48.209]  We didn't have any guests today, but I wanted to get him on because I noticed on his Twitter
[02:47:49.847 --> 02:48:04.230]  I saw a bunch of so-called Hollywood stars, that whole Aleister Crowley, you know, they're stars, they're gods, they're goddesses, defending James Gunn and his hundreds of tweets about raping little children and how great it is Senator Ted Cruz has rightly called for a criminal investigation.
[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.550]  My God.
[02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:09.911]  Now Hollywood's counter-defending him, they're talking about reinstating him.
[02:48:10.551 --> 02:48:18.113]  So here's the deal, even if he's not into this stuff, you say fire people that say that
[02:48:19.324 --> 02:48:22.125]  If a woman doesn't say no, but is drunk, it's not rape.
[02:48:22.145 --> 02:48:23.945]  I mean, I don't do that myself or whatever.
[02:48:24.085 --> 02:48:25.866]  I mean, I'm married, but that's not rape.
[02:48:26.826 --> 02:48:37.768]  Or Trump saying a woman jumping on him, like an Elvis Presley concert, and, you know, the women are throwing their panties at you, and okay, they jump on you so you can grab them.
[02:48:40.289 --> 02:48:40.929]  That's not rape.
[02:48:41.329 --> 02:48:42.990]  So, but that's the end of the world.
[02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.810]  Remove the president.
[02:48:45.785 --> 02:48:49.408]  All these women that have gone public in between his divorces said, oh, he treated me really nice.
[02:48:49.988 --> 02:48:51.029]  He was super sweet to me.
[02:48:51.610 --> 02:48:52.971]  And he gave me all this nice stuff.
[02:48:53.031 --> 02:48:55.213]  By the way, I'm going to get a million dollars now to talk about it.
[02:48:55.293 --> 02:48:57.395]  I mean, it's like, wow.
[02:48:58.135 --> 02:48:59.236]  But I'll give the women credit.
[02:48:59.296 --> 02:49:00.297]  They can't get any of them.
[02:49:00.317 --> 02:49:01.218]  There's like only three of them.
[02:49:03.027 --> 02:49:06.069]  to say that he did anything, but I'm not just here to defend Trump.
[02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:21.001]  If real stuff came out on Trump, I would cover it, but you've got Epstein and Mueller protecting him and the pedophilia, and now that we're digging into more of the tweets of these Hollywood people, it's everywhere.
[02:49:21.041 --> 02:49:21.481]  It's like a
[02:49:23.146 --> 02:49:29.868]  Right of passage, it's like a sign, a gang sign, that, hey, we're into defiling children.
[02:49:30.129 --> 02:49:31.909]  We want to abort as many as we can.
[02:49:32.789 --> 02:49:38.251]  You've got Gloria Steinem of the CIA, by the way, she wrote that in her own book, saying, you know, I love aborting kids.
[02:49:38.331 --> 02:49:39.152]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[02:49:39.172 --> 02:49:41.573]  I mean, this is really a sacrament is what I'm saying.
[02:49:41.833 --> 02:49:44.754]  And I'm not judging you if you had an abortion and didn't know what was going on or whatever.
[02:49:44.794 --> 02:49:45.474]  None of us are perfect.
[02:49:45.814 --> 02:49:46.114]  But it's
[02:50:05.029 --> 02:50:10.552]  Allie Alexander, I've seen some of the great stuff you've been putting out, playing this out there at Allie Alexander at Allie.
[02:50:11.393 --> 02:50:12.893]  What's your take on this situation?
[02:50:12.914 --> 02:50:15.475]  I mean, they may actually reinstate this guy.
[02:50:15.515 --> 02:50:20.558]  This may be the coming out of the closet for, you know, whether he's into child molestation or not.
[02:50:20.598 --> 02:50:24.160]  He's certainly pushing it as a fetish in the whole fantasy realm.
[02:50:25.191 --> 02:50:35.743]  You know, it's really interesting because here you have ordinary Americans, parents, child advocates, sensible people saying that this man should not have this job.
[02:50:35.863 --> 02:50:42.330]  And then, you know, there's some fringe elements of these far-right social conservatives who, you know, hate gay marriage.
[02:50:42.370 --> 02:50:43.511]  They're for traditional marriage.
[02:50:43.531 --> 02:50:44.272]  They're against that.
[02:50:44.292 --> 02:50:45.173]  They're against Trump.
[02:50:45.494 --> 02:50:46.335]  But they're for
[02:50:46.915 --> 02:50:55.537]  This guy, who has tens of thousands of tweets connected to the deletion because of his pedophile commentary, saying, well, it's a free speech issue.
[02:50:55.557 --> 02:50:58.458]  Well, one, Alex, the government's not involved in this issue.
[02:50:58.518 --> 02:50:59.718]  It's not a free speech issue.
[02:51:00.098 --> 02:51:02.079]  And secondly, it's just common sense.
[02:51:02.199 --> 02:51:04.279]  Should this man be working around children?
[02:51:04.559 --> 02:51:05.980]  No one's calling for him to be jailed.
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:07.460]  No one's saying he should never work again.
[02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:10.781]  We're simply saying that he should not work around children.
[02:51:10.801 --> 02:51:12.141]  Well, Ali, I don't want to disagree with you.
[02:51:12.441 --> 02:51:15.643]  And I think you're overall 95% right, but Ted Cruz is right.
[02:51:16.563 --> 02:51:19.405]  I don't have a lot of time, but I read what Mike Cernovich tweeted.
[02:51:19.425 --> 02:51:25.148]  I didn't just believe it, and though I trust Mike, he's a really good source, good guy, good father, person, good husband.
[02:51:25.488 --> 02:51:29.190]  I went and looked for myself in the Wayback Machine because he deleted it.
[02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:38.696]  And man, dude, I spent like an hour Saturday reading this crap, and it's like how fun it is to rape little girls, how fun it is to do that with little boys, how good it is to kill them.
[02:51:39.176 --> 02:51:41.417]  I mean, this is like a freakazoid, man.
[02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:44.199]  He was sending out hundreds of tweets.
[02:51:44.339 --> 02:51:47.241]  So I get we're not saying take his free speech away.
[02:51:47.621 --> 02:51:49.362]  I'm just saying, do you agree with Ted Cruz?
[02:51:49.402 --> 02:51:50.323]  He should be investigated.
[02:51:51.039 --> 02:51:52.820]  Absolutely, and that's the difference here.
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:53.960]  We're not prejudging.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.421]  We're simply saying there is enough evidence to warrant an escalation.
[02:51:57.501 --> 02:52:01.963]  If I sent out a hundred tweets saying I want to kidnap and rape kids, I need to get a frickin' warrant.
[02:52:02.703 --> 02:52:04.004]  My house needs to get raided.
[02:52:04.824 --> 02:52:05.364]  Damn right.
[02:52:05.424 --> 02:52:11.686]  And Alex, it's actually a felony in America to purport anything as child porn and put that out there, which he did.
[02:52:12.026 --> 02:52:13.387]  So on the face of that... Let's be clear.
[02:52:13.407 --> 02:52:16.868]  Even if it isn't child porn, if you purport it and label it that, it's a crime.
[02:52:17.714 --> 02:52:18.594]  Yep, that's a felony.
[02:52:18.835 --> 02:52:24.277]  So, you know, it looks like, I mean, it's obvious that this James Gunn guy should not be working around children.
[02:52:24.317 --> 02:52:26.138]  He probably committed a felony.
[02:52:26.558 --> 02:52:35.562]  Worse is he's connected to a gentleman by the name of Hudson Huddleston, who just last month pleaded guilty to housing gigabytes and gigabytes of child porn.
[02:52:35.882 --> 02:52:41.965]  And this is the man who gave him the video that was purported as 100 PPS girls touching themselves.
[02:52:42.245 --> 02:52:47.008]  So this guy is a part of this network, and like you're talking about, we believe that there's a rite of passage.
[02:52:47.048 --> 02:52:54.613]  We believe that this is funny to the sick people who are actually doing it, and this is why it's so baffling to the rest of us in middle of America.
[02:52:54.993 --> 02:52:56.394]  And it's been our restraint.
[02:52:57.264 --> 02:53:01.688]  Well, they're on some Russian witch hunt, or, you know, we're telling our kids they have a gender witch hunt.
[02:53:02.449 --> 02:53:18.664]  It's total sexualization of children, and you look at Hollywood standing ovation for Polanski, with Weinstein in the background standing ovation, and then him on 50-plus flights, Bill Clinton on 23 flights, with a guy that was up to seven-year-old girls.
[02:53:18.764 --> 02:53:19.905]  I mean, let me be honest with you.
[02:53:20.425 --> 02:53:23.427]  I have a real instinct to not get on an airplane and go after these guys.
[02:53:23.908 --> 02:53:43.722]  I mean, you read about the snuff films and the torture of little girls, I mean, and the Italian news reported on thousands of VHS tapes shipped into LA, that's their main source, with, like, Russian porn shot in Russia of two-year-old toddlers gang-raped by a line of men with horse-level Johnsons.
[02:53:43.782 --> 02:53:44.643]  I don't mean to be gross here.
[02:53:45.023 --> 02:53:46.865]  And then they blow the little boys' heads off.
[02:53:47.625 --> 02:53:49.607]  And this is confirmed FBI files.
[02:53:50.467 --> 02:53:56.272]  I mean, Hollywood is literally watching two-year-old boys gang-raped by men and their heads blown off.
[02:53:56.652 --> 02:53:58.354]  And then Salon says it's cute and funny.
[02:54:00.555 --> 02:54:02.917]  I hate to be like that, Ollie, but this is what's going on.
[02:54:02.937 --> 02:54:05.099]  We're a family show, but this is what they're doing.
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:06.020]  Yeah.
[02:54:06.613 --> 02:54:08.254]  I mean, it really breaks my heart.
[02:54:08.574 --> 02:54:09.875]  You know, this is not my issue.
[02:54:10.175 --> 02:54:10.956]  This isn't an issue.
[02:54:10.976 --> 02:54:16.199]  But, you know, when I saw Mike, like you, when I saw Mike on this issue, I said, OK, well, I'm going to take it a little seriously.
[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:23.344]  And what I couldn't live with, Alex, is knowing that any other conservative out there would mislabel this as a free speech issue.
[02:54:23.404 --> 02:54:28.127]  If we're not going to protect the children in politics and media, what the hell are we doing here?
[02:54:28.487 --> 02:54:29.608]  What the hell are we doing here?
[02:54:29.668 --> 02:54:31.349]  No, man, I totally, what I'm telling, exactly.
[02:54:31.529 --> 02:54:35.011]  I would hear this 20, 20, like I said earlier, 25 years ago from major generals.
[02:54:35.611 --> 02:54:37.172]  And I thought, this old guy's crazy.
[02:54:37.632 --> 02:54:40.614]  And then, but this is how they compromise people.
[02:54:41.377 --> 02:54:41.537]  Yep.
[02:54:42.158 --> 02:54:48.081]  And this is, and look, we've seen in the past year, what was that, that actress from Superman, she was a part of the sex cult.
[02:54:48.322 --> 02:54:51.904]  She was actually the number two in charge of branding people, branding people.
[02:54:52.164 --> 02:54:58.849]  By the way, I said last year before the NXIVM cult broke, I was told by high level sources, they starve women because they're the goddess.
[02:54:58.869 --> 02:54:59.869]  This is what the Satanists believe.
[02:55:00.210 --> 02:55:03.112]  If they can make a woman starve herself and then they brand them.
[02:55:03.192 --> 02:55:04.252]  I didn't even know the name of the group.
[02:55:04.392 --> 02:55:08.075]  I said on air, Harvey Weinstein brands women and starves them to death.
[02:55:08.415 --> 02:55:09.776]  And the Huffington Post attacked me.
[02:55:09.796 --> 02:55:10.937]  It was later confirmed.
[02:55:11.577 --> 02:55:18.443]  Yeah, and what I'm being told in Hollywood now is, it's amazing, is when this story broke, people were reaching out to me.
[02:55:18.463 --> 02:55:20.825]  They said, Ali, how can we talk to you confidentially?
[02:55:20.845 --> 02:55:24.188]  I had to give my Wicker account, my Signal account, ProtonMail.
[02:55:24.248 --> 02:55:27.291]  Oh, I've had Corey Feldman, all of them, call me 10 years ago, yeah.
[02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:33.773]  Yeah, the tips are rolling in now, and they're like, Ali, Disney is considering rehiring James Gunn.
[02:55:33.953 --> 02:55:42.098]  There's a million dollars in walking money out there to push a narrative that he needs to be rehired because it's just you Trumpists that are opposed to him.
[02:55:42.118 --> 02:55:44.659]  But let's be honest, why are these pedophile apologists?
[02:55:44.679 --> 02:55:46.940]  Let's not say he's a pedophile, he just says he loves raping children.
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:47.221]  Right.
[02:55:48.161 --> 02:55:50.062]  Why does he look like the Subway founder?
[02:55:50.082 --> 02:55:55.706]  Because they all, and I don't want to be mean to white people, but like, when whites do things that are wrong, I'll say it.
[02:55:56.086 --> 02:55:59.848]  Why are, like most of the pedophiles we see, white or Hispanic?
[02:56:00.749 --> 02:56:02.570]  I don't see a lot of black pedophiles in the news.
[02:56:03.851 --> 02:56:12.937]  Well, I mean, you know, culturally speaking, uh, the black community is, is generally, uh, I don't know how else to put this, but less sexually deviant than some of these other cultures.
[02:56:12.977 --> 02:56:17.200]  Black men on average like souped up, super hot women that are super, yeah, that's what I like.
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:18.221]  It's like a powerful woman.
[02:56:18.821 --> 02:56:22.804]  Like that's the whole conquest is a big old juicy woman, but not like some kid.
[02:56:22.864 --> 02:56:23.645]  I mean, who the hell, yeah.
[02:56:24.457 --> 02:56:29.040]  Yeah, it's an archaic, traditional role of a man and a woman that most black men like.
[02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:39.486]  And, you know, it is kind of weird when you look at the physiology of some of these people, you know, these creeps, be it, you know, the sex cults, be it the pedophiles, you know, be it all kinds of other people.
[02:56:39.506 --> 02:56:41.327]  So let's say it, why are most of the pedophiles white?
[02:56:41.447 --> 02:56:45.670]  Because when it comes to bashing whites, most of the time it's bull, but what's wrong with white people?
[02:56:47.049 --> 02:56:47.669]  Well, I don't know.
[02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:49.650]  I think that there's, you know... No, I don't know you.
[02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:54.372]  You don't want to go there, but the criminology shows, like, 80% of convicted pedophiles are white males.
[02:56:55.392 --> 02:56:55.573]  Yeah.
[02:56:56.013 --> 02:56:57.313]  So what is going on with white people?
[02:56:58.634 --> 02:56:58.994]  I don't know.
[02:56:59.194 --> 02:57:00.094]  It's the network, dude.
[02:57:00.174 --> 02:57:00.875]  It's the network.
[02:57:02.515 --> 02:57:03.496]  Well, I'm a white male.
[02:57:03.636 --> 02:57:05.717]  I don't want to frickin' have sex with a kid.
[02:57:06.477 --> 02:57:07.217]  I'd rather die.
[02:57:07.277 --> 02:57:11.419]  I have no attraction to children other than, like, I want to protect them and I want to kill people that want to hurt them.
[02:57:11.819 --> 02:57:12.919]  I want to... I'll be honest.
[02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:15.481]  I want to kill pedophiles!
[02:57:15.561 --> 02:57:15.661]  God!
[02:57:20.447 --> 02:57:21.268]  Ali, I know I'm ranting.
[02:57:21.308 --> 02:57:23.349]  We're going to come back for a break, but where do you think this ends?
[02:57:23.369 --> 02:57:26.851]  Because this is all this coming out of them, them bragging about everything.
[02:57:26.891 --> 02:57:27.732]  What do you think is going on here?
[02:57:28.432 --> 02:57:29.633]  This is us versus them.
[02:57:29.713 --> 02:57:32.194]  If they win this, then it's going to become normalized.
[02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:34.316]  If we win this, we change Hollywood.
[02:57:35.196 --> 02:57:35.957]  And that's how they do it.
[02:57:36.037 --> 02:57:38.138]  Oh, we're just teaching the kid their sexuality.
[02:57:38.158 --> 02:57:42.040]  Oh, we're just like, oh, we love pizza and all these weird school things.
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:43.221]  Like, I love pizza.
[02:57:43.261 --> 02:57:44.722]  I'm going to show your kid hardcore porn.
[02:57:46.043 --> 02:57:46.843]  God, this is sick.
[02:57:47.744 --> 02:57:48.504]  This is so sick.
[02:57:48.524 --> 02:57:49.045]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:52.543 --> 02:57:53.204]  It's all happening.
[02:57:54.745 --> 02:57:55.866]  Trump is a nationalist.
[02:57:56.907 --> 02:57:57.828]  The country's coming back.
[02:57:59.534 --> 02:58:07.800]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him through a military coup, or through the 25th Amendment.
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:08.860]  It's unbelievable.
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:10.241]  It's all happening right now.
[02:58:10.741 --> 02:58:20.188]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[02:58:20.868 --> 02:58:29.014]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[02:58:29.674 --> 02:58:30.294]  They're the traitors.
[02:58:31.075 --> 02:58:33.055]  They may be successful removing our president.
[02:58:33.396 --> 02:58:35.756]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:36.237 --> 02:58:41.099]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[02:58:41.379 --> 02:58:43.820]  We are in the middle of the second American Revolution.
[02:58:44.200 --> 02:58:46.901]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[02:58:47.341 --> 02:58:51.447]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[02:58:51.507 --> 02:58:53.690]  We just keep boosting the sales.

[02:59:35.909 --> 02:59:36.650]  Pay it forward.

[02:59:41.012 --> 02:59:43.254]  This is the battle for the future.
[02:59:43.614 --> 02:59:44.735]  This is the war for the future.
[02:59:45.095 --> 02:59:48.577]  And I need all of you to commit even more to this fight.
[02:59:48.898 --> 02:59:49.218]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.538 --> 02:59:50.879]  I'm counting on you, and I salute you.
[02:59:54.723 --> 03:00:00.649]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.145 --> 03:00:26.671]  Let's go!
[03:00:27.270 --> 03:00:32.754]  As we told you two years ago before Trump won, this is a war on pedophiles because that's their operating system.
[03:00:32.794 --> 03:00:33.754]  It's how they control people.
[03:00:34.495 --> 03:00:40.459]  So Victor Brzezinski wrote about it, The Technotronic Era and others, how they control the criminal elements they thought for overall control.
[03:00:40.959 --> 03:00:42.120]  Ali Alexander's our guest.
[03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:43.121]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[03:00:43.161 --> 03:00:44.642]  More of your calls as well after he leaves us.
[03:00:45.122 --> 03:00:45.983]  I've been ranting here.
[03:00:46.383 --> 03:00:52.467]  You have come out and pointed out, rightfully so, in articles that they are calling for his rehiring James Gunn.
[03:00:53.408 --> 03:00:56.470]  And just the sickening nature of this
[03:00:57.450 --> 03:01:08.277]  Where they say that if somebody ever makes a crass joke or Roseanne Barr makes a joke About I never knew that the lady she made fun of was part african-american.
[03:01:08.297 --> 03:01:16.702]  I even know that She's got a point though like they can do all this But then when we say something we get fired or we get blackballed.
[03:01:17.162 --> 03:01:18.683]  Where do you see this ending?
[03:01:19.463 --> 03:01:25.027]  with their doubling down to defend James Gunn and his pedophilia obsession
[03:01:25.899 --> 03:01:28.680]  Yeah, I mean, this is a war over territory.
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.900]  This is power dynamics.
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:37.663]  So what a lot of people see is that they believe that Mike Cernovich and other people, you and I, are holding the left to their standards.
[03:01:37.703 --> 03:01:41.845]  And there is, I think, a proper role for that and a time for that.
[03:01:42.225 --> 03:01:45.086]  This situation happens to be about protecting children.
[03:01:45.146 --> 03:01:46.246]  It's a risk assessment.
[03:01:46.486 --> 03:01:54.629]  We don't want to put people who have an interest in advocating for pedophilia or associate it with pedophile networks or child pornographers.
[03:01:55.350 --> 03:01:59.334]  But where this broader is going is that we have to hold them to their standards.
[03:01:59.374 --> 03:02:00.575]  We absolutely have to.
[03:02:00.836 --> 03:02:07.023]  It's only through mutually assured destruction did Russia and the United States come to the negotiating table.
[03:02:07.063 --> 03:02:08.184]  It's peace through strength.
[03:02:08.224 --> 03:02:13.350]  Reagan said, you know what, I'll take you out, I'll take you out, I'll take you out, or you can have the hand of friendship.
[03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:20.836]  And, you know, the USSR folded in, they became the modern Russia, and, you know, they're still working some of that stuff out.
[03:02:20.936 --> 03:02:23.158]  But, you know, this is what we need the left to understand.
[03:02:23.178 --> 03:02:24.419]  We want you to be our neighbors.
[03:02:24.459 --> 03:02:25.700]  We want you to be our brothers.
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:26.921]  We want you to be our sisters.
[03:02:26.941 --> 03:02:31.384]  Stop endorsing the most insane, evil faction of your control arm.
[03:02:31.484 --> 03:02:40.492]  And here's this Dan Harmon, you know, big comedian, with a Showtime special we now learned seven, eight years ago, where he breaks in a house and rapes a baby.
[03:02:41.272 --> 03:02:47.214]  And he's apologizing for it now, but imagine if you or I or anybody else did that, it'd be over, and it should be.
[03:02:47.734 --> 03:02:50.935]  Again, what is this rite of passage that they're all engaged in?
[03:02:50.975 --> 03:02:56.017]  Here's a one-minute clip of this blurb of him simulated raping a baby, which people say, oh, well, it's not real.
[03:02:56.077 --> 03:02:59.618]  In lesser magic, in Bohemian Grove, it's a mock human sacrifice.
[03:02:59.978 --> 03:03:05.180]  This is what they do, is they sell it to you in the public, and it's even better than doing it in reality.
[03:03:05.220 --> 03:03:05.600]  Here it is.
[03:03:06.660 --> 03:03:08.441]  Thank you for being such a good patient.
[03:03:10.254 --> 03:03:12.996]  For taking all the sleeping pills I prescribed to you.
[03:03:14.517 --> 03:03:21.021]  So that later tonight, when I'm crawling in your window, I can count on you to sleep like a baby.
[03:03:25.064 --> 03:03:27.645]  While I do everything but sleep with yours.
[03:03:27.665 --> 03:03:33.489]  Then the baby cries as he wipes it.
[03:03:38.826 --> 03:03:47.045]  So to them, this is the ultimate power, is to get in the face of our genetics, the face of our instincts, and to rape our children in front of us.
[03:03:48.447 --> 03:03:49.288]  It's not funny.
[03:03:49.628 --> 03:03:50.669]  It's not a joke.
[03:03:51.049 --> 03:03:57.714]  This normalizes, this hurts children, this scars children, this changes people's sexuality, their relationship with God and church.
[03:03:58.175 --> 03:04:05.381]  It is disgusting, and conservatives and freedom-loving Americans have a right to speak out against this, and that's why we've put up a petition.
[03:04:05.441 --> 03:04:07.743]  Disney, do not rehire James Gunn.
[03:04:07.863 --> 03:04:08.703]  Let's talk about that.
[03:04:08.883 --> 03:04:09.304]  Talk about it.
[03:04:09.344 --> 03:04:11.305]  I should have had you on up front about that emergency.
[03:04:11.325 --> 03:04:13.507]  Tell at Disney not to rehire James Gunn.
[03:04:13.527 --> 03:04:14.288]  Where do people find it?
[03:04:15.569 --> 03:04:16.790]  Millions need to sign this right now.
[03:04:17.296 --> 03:04:22.339]  Millions need to sign it because there's 300,000 people on the other side of this petition trying to get him rehired.
[03:04:22.359 --> 03:04:25.321]  There's a million dollars of walking money in Hollywood PR money.
[03:04:25.702 --> 03:04:29.164]  There's Ben Shapiro and the National Review and other people advocating for it.
[03:04:29.464 --> 03:04:32.346]  We need hundreds of thousands of Americans to stand with us.
[03:04:32.726 --> 03:04:35.748]  Infowars, myself, Mike Cernovich, Jack Pasopic.
[03:04:36.129 --> 03:04:39.811]  We need to stand against the normalization of the sexualization of children.
[03:04:39.831 --> 03:04:41.092]  Sure, how do they find the petition?
[03:04:41.592 --> 03:04:42.853]  Twitter.com slash ALI.
[03:04:43.013 --> 03:04:43.834]  You can find the link.
[03:04:43.894 --> 03:04:44.975]  It goes to change.org.
[03:04:46.377 --> 03:04:49.719]  We've got one up there from Paul Watson as well to stop the shadowbanning.
[03:04:50.079 --> 03:04:51.860]  All right, Ali Alexander, thank you so much.
[03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:52.840]  Introduce Paul Watson.
[03:04:53.201 --> 03:04:56.082]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:56.122 --> 03:04:57.543]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:57.563 --> 03:05:00.505]  As Paul Watson's video breaks down, pedophiles rule the world.
[03:05:00.525 --> 03:05:01.105]  Let's change that.
[03:05:03.869 --> 03:05:08.950]  Anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[03:05:09.591 --> 03:05:14.752]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[03:05:15.112 --> 03:05:21.774]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines.
[03:05:22.474 --> 03:05:25.695]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[03:05:26.435 --> 03:05:30.116]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now and collapsing our borders.
[03:05:30.676 --> 03:05:31.837]  And my only message is this.
[03:05:32.097 --> 03:05:35.158]  Everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[03:05:35.998 --> 03:05:43.481]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[03:05:44.001 --> 03:05:46.842]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power.
[03:05:46.862 --> 03:05:47.762]  We already have the power.
[03:05:48.002 --> 03:05:52.904]  But we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[03:05:53.744 --> 03:05:56.187]  InfoWars is on the front line, and so are you.
[03:05:56.467 --> 03:05:57.788]  We are the resistance!
[03:05:57.808 --> 03:06:09.099]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:14.845]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:06:31.824 --> 03:06:34.165]  Alright, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:06:34.205 --> 03:06:35.405]  Paul Watson's taking over.
[03:06:35.445 --> 03:06:38.006]  I got Tyler, I got John, I got Rick, I got Kevin.
[03:06:38.306 --> 03:06:39.406]  It's hard to get Paul on air.
[03:06:39.426 --> 03:06:40.386]  He's a very shy guy.
[03:06:40.406 --> 03:06:45.328]  Everybody gets to see him on YouTube with his hundreds of millions of views because I'm proud of the fact that I made him get on air.
[03:06:45.788 --> 03:06:48.989]  Paul, I'm going to take a few calls and let you take over here, but I promise to go these calls.
[03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:56.251]  What is front and center on your guns up view here today that you're going to be covering?
[03:06:59.864 --> 03:07:03.205]  Media censorship as Ali is exposed today.
[03:07:03.565 --> 03:07:06.947]  They're now literally shadow banning Republican congressmen.
[03:07:06.987 --> 03:07:08.287]  It's got down to that level.
[03:07:08.707 --> 03:07:15.630]  We've confirmed through doing searches on Twitter when you're logged out of a Twitter account, you search in my full name, what comes up.
[03:07:15.890 --> 03:07:17.811]  Not my official verified account, Alex.
[03:07:18.391 --> 03:07:20.212]  Like literally 10 parody accounts.
[03:07:20.272 --> 03:07:21.412]  That's what comes up, okay?
[03:07:21.692 --> 03:07:22.533]  That's deliberate.
[03:07:22.873 --> 03:07:27.715]  People need to realize how much this matters because this can shift millions of votes.
[03:07:27.755 --> 03:07:30.336]  The algorithm changes can shift millions of votes.
[03:07:30.796 --> 03:07:38.179]  And you know, to be honest Alex, when I look at the articles we've put out over the past couple of weeks that we've worked really hard on, the petitions that we've put out,
[03:07:38.739 --> 03:07:44.023]  Those articles on InfoWars get the least comments out of anything else on the front page of InfoWars.
[03:07:44.364 --> 03:07:46.565]  I don't think people get how important this is.
[03:07:46.866 --> 03:07:52.230]  It might not be that important to their day-to-day lives, but it's important to winning elections.
[03:07:52.650 --> 03:07:54.192]  This is crucial.
[03:07:54.272 --> 03:07:57.274]  They've done studies through professors Robert Epstein and others.
[03:07:57.594 --> 03:08:00.637]  This can shift millions of votes on election day.
[03:08:02.458 --> 03:08:13.121]  And Twitter bragged a few years ago, we're delivering all votes to Obama, all votes to Hillary, and they are massively shadow banning, as you said, members of Congress, everybody now, ahead of the midterms.
[03:08:13.221 --> 03:08:18.783]  This is the big issue, not just for Trump to get re-elected, or for the 2018, but for free speech.
[03:08:18.863 --> 03:08:20.183]  And the same thing's happening in Europe.
[03:08:20.603 --> 03:08:22.644]  How do we force this issue out?
[03:08:24.471 --> 03:08:29.093]  Well, obviously, we've got the ear of some people in the Trump administration to get this out.
[03:08:29.153 --> 03:08:30.413]  They need to talk about it more.
[03:08:30.453 --> 03:08:31.874]  They need to put it on the front burner.
[03:08:32.134 --> 03:08:35.335]  We need to get questions in Parliament in the UK, which we're working on.
[03:08:35.915 --> 03:08:38.056]  And, I mean, come on, you can sign a petition.
[03:08:38.436 --> 03:08:41.838]  For God's sake, it's got, what, 14,000 signatures?
[03:08:41.858 --> 03:08:44.139]  It should have 200,000 signatures.
[03:08:44.159 --> 03:08:45.599]  It takes 30 seconds.
[03:08:46.079 --> 03:08:52.322]  Alex, they could get 300,000 people to sign a petition to rehire James Gunn, a paedophile apologist.
[03:08:52.802 --> 03:08:54.243]  Come on, at least we can get $100,000.
[03:08:54.663 --> 03:08:59.347]  Well, that's because they shadow ban us everywhere and conservatives and libertarians are awake.
[03:08:59.787 --> 03:09:01.188]  They think, oh, everybody's awake.
[03:09:01.268 --> 03:09:03.009]  No, it's a total war.
[03:09:03.450 --> 03:09:06.212]  So people need to go to change.org, they need to sign that petition.
[03:09:06.652 --> 03:09:08.553]  But regardless, Trump is aware of it.
[03:09:08.573 --> 03:09:10.074]  He's just trying to get the economy going.
[03:09:10.495 --> 03:09:11.715]  He's fighting on so many fronts.
[03:09:11.776 --> 03:09:16.019]  But then the question is, how do we even respond to Google, Twitter, Facebook?
[03:09:16.059 --> 03:09:19.121]  The censorship is exponentially big.
[03:09:19.241 --> 03:09:20.642]  They're getting ready to make their move, Paul.
[03:09:20.942 --> 03:09:25.063]  Just like they covered up the Islamic attack of Fazeel Hussain in Toronto.
[03:09:26.963 --> 03:09:28.664]  Yeah, that's something else I'm going to cover.
[03:09:28.864 --> 03:09:36.345]  Because of course, every time there's a mass shooting in the US or Canada or wherever, immediately the left become inflamed with fury.
[03:09:36.605 --> 03:09:39.266]  They say, why aren't they calling this terrorism?
[03:09:39.326 --> 03:09:41.786]  My God, this is an obvious sign of white supremacy.
[03:09:42.346 --> 03:09:43.327]  What happened this time?
[03:09:43.667 --> 03:09:46.447]  It took them 24 hours to release this guy's name.
[03:09:46.967 --> 03:09:47.868]  He's obviously Muslim.
[03:09:47.908 --> 03:09:49.108]  He was in Afghanistan.
[03:09:49.128 --> 03:09:49.948]  He was in Pakistan.
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:51.701]  And what did the left say?
[03:09:51.781 --> 03:09:54.724]  Oh how dare you even suggest this was a terrorist attack?
[03:09:54.945 --> 03:10:03.193]  They had like a PR firm with lawyers put out a press release from the family within minutes after his name being released saying oh it's just mental issues.
[03:10:03.634 --> 03:10:07.638]  Now we find out, and this is being reported in like one Canadian news outlet,
[03:10:08.268 --> 03:10:12.973]  That he was an ISIS supporter, he liked jihadist material online.
[03:10:13.213 --> 03:10:15.875]  This was obviously an Islamic terror attack.
[03:10:15.895 --> 03:10:20.800]  And they think that as long as they can just say, oh, mental illness, and everyone will move on, that it's going to disappear from the radar.
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:23.803]  This is total perception reality management we're facing.
[03:10:24.163 --> 03:10:27.086]  Paul Watson, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.

[03:10:58.177 --> 03:10:59.137]  Infowarstore.com.

[03:11:00.358 --> 03:11:01.439]  Okay, Paul, I'm going to be listening.
[03:11:01.479 --> 03:11:02.140]  Take over, my friend.
[03:11:03.721 --> 03:11:10.186]  All right, first up, let's stay on this issue of government censorship of information, because an absolutely shocking development over the weekend.
[03:11:10.726 --> 03:11:15.390]  Bearing in mind, in the UK, violent crime is soaring, acid attacks, stabbings are soaring.
[03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:19.573]  The other day, we had an acid attack on a three-year-old toddler
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.541]  In a shop, they're calling it, oh, this was a community tensions.
[03:11:23.561 --> 03:11:25.622]  They don't want to talk about the reason behind it.
[03:11:25.942 --> 03:11:30.323]  A three-year-old toddler got doused with acid by three assailants in a shop.
[03:11:30.803 --> 03:11:32.704]  We've got massive problems with violent crime.
[03:11:33.144 --> 03:11:37.865]  Between February and April, I believe it was, we had a higher murder rate than New York in London.
[03:11:38.565 --> 03:11:40.046]  Sadiq Khan has no answers.
[03:11:40.086 --> 03:11:42.907]  He's like, oh, I put out a report about it a couple of months ago.
[03:11:43.447 --> 03:11:44.827]  He reduced stop and search.
[03:11:44.907 --> 03:11:46.548]  Theresa May reduced stop and search.
[03:11:46.568 --> 03:11:47.428]  This is what led to it.
[03:11:48.277 --> 03:11:49.837]  Massive problems with violent crime.
[03:11:50.178 --> 03:11:51.938]  What's the government's response to that?
[03:11:52.638 --> 03:11:54.439]  Is it to increase stop and search?
[03:11:54.479 --> 03:11:56.859]  Well, they've said they're going to do that, whether it's having an effect.
[03:11:56.999 --> 03:11:58.060]  So far, it isn't.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:03.821]  What else are they going to respond to with this situation in the UK, in London, with violent crime?
[03:12:04.281 --> 03:12:06.522]  Well, they're not going to tackle violent crime head on.
[03:12:06.782 --> 03:12:10.223]  They're going to tackle people talking about violent crime.
[03:12:10.643 --> 03:12:17.345]  Headline, New British Information Unit fighting, quote, alternative news promoting government approved facts.
[03:12:18.115 --> 03:12:34.627]  So they're not spending money on police patrolling the streets to stop actual crimes, they're spending money on online commissar bureaucrats searching for false narratives about violent crime in the UK and burying them in Google's algorithm.
[03:12:34.927 --> 03:12:43.573]  This is another example of governments, this is so incredibly Orwellian, using their power to decide what information appears at the top of Google search results.
[03:12:43.653 --> 03:12:44.214]  Listen to this.
[03:12:45.799 --> 03:12:50.121]  The British government has a new unit fighting alternative news websites, i.e.
[03:12:50.302 --> 03:12:56.425]  us, Breitbart, whoever, driving their stories down search engine results and pushing the official government narrative to the top.
[03:12:57.226 --> 03:13:05.890]  Civil servant and government communication boss Alex Aitken said the Cabinet Office's new Rapid Response Unit sounds like some kind of SWAT team.
[03:13:05.951 --> 03:13:10.153]  No, it's to fight fake news, which, as you'll find out in a moment, isn't even fake.
[03:13:10.891 --> 03:13:15.253]  Which has begun a pilot, is not a fake news unit, as it was dubbed when first reported in April.
[03:13:15.773 --> 03:13:30.498]  In a blog post, and this was an official post on the government website, he described how the taxpayer-funded unit, quote, monitors news and information being shared and engaged with online, and seeks to tackle narratives from outside the mainstream media, which the establishment does not favour.
[03:13:31.158 --> 03:13:37.801]  So they get into it, and they reveal what this fake news was that they're tackling, and why it's so important to tackle it.
[03:13:38.487 --> 03:13:47.432]  Describing a specific example, he explained how the government has sought to downplay a crime wave sweeping the UK and the rising murder rate in London.
[03:13:47.712 --> 03:13:53.695]  Which is a fact that the murder rate in London is rising, has been for the last 18 months.
[03:13:53.976 --> 03:14:01.520]  It's a fact that acid attacks have tripled and quadrupled over the past few months in London and in the UK in general.
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:03.921]  It's a fact that stabbings are rising.
[03:14:04.561 --> 03:14:05.542]  Yet they're devoting
[03:14:06.426 --> 03:14:16.529]  Actual taxpayer money to create a propaganda unit to police content online to bury these stories even though they're completely factual.
[03:14:16.909 --> 03:14:23.011]  We warned you from the very beginning this whole fake news moral panic wasn't about actually tackling fake news.
[03:14:23.976 --> 03:14:28.200]  There are some fringe websites that deliberately put out news that they know to be fake.
[03:14:28.641 --> 03:14:30.442]  They're not being targeted, nobody cares about that.
[03:14:30.783 --> 03:14:34.927]  They're doing it to shift narratives and to manipulate public opinion.
[03:14:35.167 --> 03:14:38.390]  That's what the fake news narrative was created for in the first place.
[03:14:39.171 --> 03:14:43.535]  So it describes the specific example of what they're devoting money to, to fight.
[03:14:44.184 --> 03:14:53.446]  Says, in early April, a number of articles from US and UK outlets reported on murder rates in London outstripping New York for the first time based on selective use of data.
[03:14:53.866 --> 03:14:54.746]  That happened!
[03:14:55.326 --> 03:14:56.806]  It was widely reported.
[03:14:57.146 --> 03:15:03.688]  So they say, oh, if you take it from these parameters, then it didn't technically outstrip the murder rate in New York.
[03:15:03.928 --> 03:15:05.628]  You know, it was a few murders short.
[03:15:06.568 --> 03:15:10.909]  Yet the general trend from parameters that were selected and reported on
[03:15:11.727 --> 03:15:15.449]  Yes, the murder rate did outstrip New York at the beginning of this year.
[03:15:15.809 --> 03:15:18.930]  There you see, I think it's CBS News reporting on it right there.
[03:15:19.250 --> 03:15:22.552]  So this isn't even fringe alternative websites.
[03:15:22.572 --> 03:15:24.813]  This is actually mainstream media websites.
[03:15:25.113 --> 03:15:38.639]  But because they don't like the narrative that London, that the UK has a soaring violent crime problem, they're devoting actual taxpayer money not to solve that violent crime problem with new police officers, with new policing methods,
[03:15:39.483 --> 03:15:39.643]  No.
[03:15:39.883 --> 03:15:55.677]  They're using the money to create propaganda units to police content online and downvote it in Google search rankings results because if they can just pretend it's not happening, if they can just manipulate people into thinking it's not happening, then maybe it's not happening.
[03:15:56.238 --> 03:15:57.259]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:15:57.279 --> 03:15:58.040]  We'll be back with more.
[03:15:58.060 --> 03:16:00.602]  This is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[03:16:03.775 --> 03:16:04.735]  What should we call you?
[03:16:04.775 --> 03:16:08.716]  Should we call you a Starbucks whistleblower?
[03:16:08.936 --> 03:16:11.077]  Or a Starbucks ex?
[03:16:11.397 --> 03:16:13.577]  Patriotic barista?
[03:16:14.217 --> 03:16:15.197]  I could feel it already.
[03:16:15.578 --> 03:16:16.558]  There is division.
[03:16:16.598 --> 03:16:21.019]  This has not done anything good for Starbucks or for our store.
[03:16:21.079 --> 03:16:22.559]  And it's not going to help.
[03:16:22.639 --> 03:16:25.680]  Especially when they start expanding it to other companies.
[03:16:25.700 --> 03:16:27.200]  Because we know this is just the start.
[03:16:30.487 --> 03:16:34.871]  Learning a session on race bias and creating a welcoming environment to all.
[03:16:35.251 --> 03:16:36.512]  It sounds super great, right?
[03:16:36.832 --> 03:16:37.753]  This is their own words.
[03:16:37.953 --> 03:16:42.137]  This training was developed with guidance by national and local experts.
[03:16:42.597 --> 03:16:43.478]  They're talking experts.
[03:16:44.178 --> 03:16:45.359]  So it sounds really good.
[03:16:45.419 --> 03:16:45.960]  We're positive.
[03:16:45.980 --> 03:16:46.680]  We're going to do it.
[03:16:47.221 --> 03:16:50.744]  And then we look at the experts who are actually devising this
[03:16:52.771 --> 03:17:01.997]  We have Cheryl Flynn, Cheryl Eiffel, president of the director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, served on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[03:17:02.657 --> 03:17:08.020]  We have Heather McGee, president of DEMO, a left-leaning public policy organization.
[03:17:08.420 --> 03:17:08.941]  Guess what?
[03:17:09.041 --> 03:17:12.243]  She also served on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[03:17:13.123 --> 03:17:16.105]  Bryan Stevenson, lawyer, social justice
[03:17:17.287 --> 03:17:21.953]  And you guessed it, he also serves on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[03:17:22.293 --> 03:17:23.394]  And it doesn't just stop there.
[03:17:23.795 --> 03:17:31.064]  There are a few more names of experts who are also connected directly, like you said, Alex, to George Soros and these left-leaning policies.
[03:17:31.224 --> 03:17:34.067]  And what was funny was there was no other races that were involved.
[03:17:34.107 --> 03:17:35.289]  It was only black.
[03:17:36.230 --> 03:17:38.311]  No Hispanic, no Asian, nothing.
[03:17:38.431 --> 03:17:39.992]  It was just black versus white.
[03:17:40.032 --> 03:17:48.459]  And then we got to this video by Stanley Nelson, which I'd like to mention, he was the director and writer of the documentary The Black Panther, Vanguard of the Revolution.
[03:17:48.479 --> 03:17:53.763]  So he had this video, he made this video for Starbucks, specifically it's called The Story of Access.
[03:17:54.183 --> 03:17:55.684]  You can find it right on the website.
[03:17:56.285 --> 03:17:58.066]  And we had to watch it all together.
[03:17:58.086 --> 03:17:59.047]  It was so uncomfortable.
[03:17:59.187 --> 03:18:04.431]  They showed horrible scenes from the 60s, showing discrimination against blacks in public places.
[03:18:06.460 --> 03:18:07.241]  We're good to go.
[03:18:38.123 --> 03:18:38.924]  That's all they want.
[03:18:59.637 --> 03:19:00.758]  Nothing changed in America.
[03:19:00.838 --> 03:19:02.118]  We don't get credit for anything.
[03:19:02.178 --> 03:19:10.122]  Just makes me think that if a small percentage of the black Americans feel like this, this can be really critical to our future.
[03:19:10.142 --> 03:19:11.123]  They have to wake up.
[03:19:11.243 --> 03:19:12.403]  They have to be red pills.
[03:19:12.463 --> 03:19:21.888]  And what's funny is at the end of the day of the training, we were left with, I would say, probably about 1% of strategy on how to deal with problem customers.
[03:19:22.808 --> 03:19:28.151]  Everything else was pretty much race-baiting, victim, shove-in-your-face propaganda.
[03:19:29.531 --> 03:19:30.291]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:30.751 --> 03:19:35.593]  And you can see that the pressure from Black Lives Matter is ultimately going to tank this company.
[03:19:35.633 --> 03:19:42.274]  Because now, heck, I'm going to tell everyone to come in with their chessboards, their Dunkin' Donuts, and they should just have lunch right in Starbucks.
[03:19:42.395 --> 03:19:47.016]  Because, heck, we invite every single person who walks through that store as a customer now.
[03:19:47.276 --> 03:19:51.937]  I don't see how anyone could listen and know that all of this training was from these lovely
[03:19:52.077 --> 03:19:54.819]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:29.433]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:29.834 --> 03:20:34.817]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:35.417 --> 03:20:35.917]  We're back.
[03:20:35.977 --> 03:20:38.178]  It is the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:38.198 --> 03:20:44.582]  We're going to talk about what happened in Toronto on Sunday night and how the media is basically covering it up at this point.
[03:20:45.022 --> 03:20:46.463]  They did from moment one.
[03:20:46.503 --> 03:20:49.245]  It took us 24 hours to even learn the name of the shooter.
[03:20:50.171 --> 03:21:02.163]  We're also going to talk about a UN plan which actually originates from 2001, where they talk about worst case scenario, flooding the United States with 600 million migrants by 2050.
[03:21:02.903 --> 03:21:04.965]  600 million.
[03:21:04.985 --> 03:21:09.089]  1.4 billion migrants in terms of Europe by 2050.
[03:21:09.690 --> 03:21:11.772]  This was the plan all along.
[03:21:11.792 --> 03:21:12.593]  We're going to get into that.
[03:21:13.447 --> 03:21:22.178]  Well, we're talking about how the UK government has set up a fake news propaganda fighting unit, which in and of itself is putting out propaganda.
[03:21:23.179 --> 03:21:30.889]  Now, we've got a massive crime problem in the UK, a massive violent crime problem in the 12 months to March, and these numbers have only gotten worse since.
[03:21:32.682 --> 03:21:38.366]  443,000 crimes out of 4.6 million resulted in a charge or summons, so the actual criminals are not being charged.
[03:21:38.886 --> 03:21:49.734]  Over the same time period, sexual offences have risen by 31%, nothing to do with Uber, I'm sure, knife and sharp implement attacks by 16% and homicides by 12%.
[03:21:51.377 --> 03:21:57.998]  Overall, the number of recorded crimes rose by 11% to 5.5 million offences, highest level in more than 10 years.
[03:21:58.359 --> 03:21:59.319]  It's a major problem.
[03:21:59.599 --> 03:22:00.519]  It's a real problem.
[03:22:00.799 --> 03:22:02.539]  And what's the government doing about it?
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:06.080]  They've set up a unit within the government.
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:10.241]  They've actually devoted resources to fight alternative news.
[03:22:10.661 --> 03:22:13.042]  What's their example of alternative news?
[03:22:13.442 --> 03:22:14.242]  The fact that for a
[03:22:14.702 --> 03:22:21.686]  Brief time earlier this year, the UK, London specifically, outstripped New York for murders, okay?
[03:22:22.486 --> 03:22:34.933]  Completely factual claim, was widely reported, yet that is the example they cite of harmful, fake news that they need to take on, that they need to devote actual taxpayer money.
[03:22:35.513 --> 03:22:37.234]  This is from the official government website.
[03:22:37.595 --> 03:22:41.757]  It says, sensationalist in nature, these stories quickly spread via social media.
[03:22:42.754 --> 03:22:43.935]  It's CBS News!
[03:22:43.955 --> 03:22:46.217]  We literally had a headline five minutes ago.
[03:22:46.377 --> 03:22:51.141]  CBS News reporting on the fact that London has outstripped New York for murders.
[03:22:51.321 --> 03:22:54.024]  Or it did, at least for a time, beginning earlier this year.
[03:22:54.044 --> 03:22:55.525]  There you see it.
[03:22:55.885 --> 03:22:58.467]  London's murder rate surpasses New York's for the first time ever.
[03:22:58.868 --> 03:23:00.549]  Complete factual story.
[03:23:00.889 --> 03:23:07.315]  That's the example of fake news that they cite, that they need to tackle, that they need to downgrade.
[03:23:07.873 --> 03:23:09.674]  And in this article they get into it.
[03:23:10.154 --> 03:23:17.216]  This is what they consider harmful, and this is what they have manipulated Google search results to downvote.
[03:23:17.276 --> 03:23:18.896]  They actually brag about that fact.
[03:23:19.276 --> 03:23:31.500]  If you read the original government blog on this, which is linked in this Breitbart article, they brag about how they now have the power to easily manipulate Google search results to make sure this fake news
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:35.144]  That London has a violent crime problem, which isn't happening of course.
[03:23:35.524 --> 03:23:36.446]  Stabbings every day.
[03:23:36.766 --> 03:23:40.811]  Literally two days ago a toddler acid attacked in a store.
[03:23:41.311 --> 03:23:42.633]  No, no, none of that's happening.
[03:23:42.933 --> 03:23:43.875]  It's all fake news.
[03:23:44.195 --> 03:23:47.940]  It's all alternative media spreading lies and harmful information.
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:51.544]  They're literally devoting government resources to bury it.
[03:23:52.088 --> 03:24:00.295]  This illustrates the fact that the whole fake news moral panic from the very beginning was not to actually tackle fake news.
[03:24:00.655 --> 03:24:03.398]  It was to reassert government narratives.
[03:24:03.758 --> 03:24:08.242]  That's what it's been about from the very beginning, which is why we have all this hysteria.
[03:24:09.125 --> 03:24:10.286]  about Russian bots.
[03:24:10.707 --> 03:24:19.214]  They're now saying that the walk away movement in America, which encourages minorities, members of LGBT community, etc, to not vote Democrat.
[03:24:19.615 --> 03:24:30.685]  Now they're saying that's Russian bots, David Hogg, CNN, you actually drill into the CNN article, they cite discredited research from a bias organization to make that claim.
[03:24:31.511 --> 03:24:35.253]  Okay, so Russian bots are spreading walk-away campaign information.
[03:24:36.013 --> 03:24:43.096]  People literally send me videos, YouTube videos, every day of black people talking about why they're joining this walk-away program.
[03:24:43.677 --> 03:24:50.940]  So have Russian bots, like, created deep, fake YouTube videos of black people talking about how they're joining this movement?
[03:24:51.260 --> 03:24:52.741]  Is that the level we've reached?
[03:24:53.286 --> 03:25:11.817]  It's absolute hysterical absurdist nonsense, but it goes to the heart of the problem that we're dealing with, which is the elite, the establishment, the legacy media, are so panicked that they're losing their influence over the minds of the American people, of people in general, because nobody trusts them anymore!
[03:25:12.378 --> 03:25:12.738]  Okay?
[03:25:12.798 --> 03:25:22.784]  You destroyed your own credibility, then you created this fake news moral panic to deflect from the true causes of why people no longer trust what you say.
[03:25:23.576 --> 03:25:26.499]  OK, you stopped being impartial a long time ago.
[03:25:26.759 --> 03:25:31.584]  You handed your networks over to activists and look what happens.
[03:25:32.144 --> 03:25:33.285]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:25:33.606 --> 03:25:44.676]  And this is a tweet I put out earlier today, which really gets to the heart of this in terms of this whole social media censorship issue, which is the left as the entire system rigged in their favour.
[03:25:44.736 --> 03:25:47.619]  Still, the entire system is rigged in their favour.
[03:25:47.919 --> 03:25:48.760]  They have Hollywood.
[03:25:49.133 --> 03:25:54.435]  They have these big events, these awards events where people get up, give speeches, they push the same narratives.
[03:25:54.795 --> 03:26:05.379]  They have the mainstream media, which pushes this fake news hysteria, this fake moral panic, which covers up things like the motive behind the Toronto shooting being Islamic terrorism.
[03:26:05.759 --> 03:26:06.859]  They have academia.
[03:26:07.139 --> 03:26:08.620]  They have the education system.
[03:26:09.426 --> 03:26:17.432]  Here in Britain, we tried to hire somebody to run free schools, a guy called Toby Young, who was a Conservative.
[03:26:17.912 --> 03:26:27.580]  They dug up his old tweets from 10 years previously, in which he made some edgy jokes, which, by the way, were nowhere near anything that James Gunn came out with, and were nothing to do with children.
[03:26:27.980 --> 03:26:31.923]  But they couldn't have one Conservative in the education system.
[03:26:32.203 --> 03:26:33.984]  It petrified them that much.
[03:26:34.405 --> 03:26:36.146]  They control the education system.
[03:26:36.406 --> 03:26:38.688]  And as we've seen, they control social media.
[03:26:39.201 --> 03:26:51.012]  To the point now where if you're logged out of Twitter, and most newbies will be as they come to Twitter, or they at least won't follow me, for example, if they try to search my name in Twitter, what comes up?
[03:26:51.713 --> 03:26:52.634]  Parody accounts.
[03:26:52.934 --> 03:26:55.336]  I have a verified account on Twitter with 882,000 followers.
[03:26:59.013 --> 03:27:10.178]  Twitter has broken its own search engine to bury people like me because they're so petrified, frightened of new people coming across our information.
[03:27:10.698 --> 03:27:17.181]  So again, they're not doing this to stop us talking to each other in our own echo chambers in Twitter.
[03:27:17.201 --> 03:27:18.121]  You can still do that.
[03:27:18.601 --> 03:27:22.483]  They're doing it to stop new people from coming in and discovering my information.
[03:27:22.503 --> 03:27:24.564]  They may see a YouTube video of mine.
[03:27:25.259 --> 03:27:26.780]  Say, oh, I'll see what he's all about.
[03:27:26.821 --> 03:27:28.102]  I love what he's saying on Twitter.
[03:27:28.502 --> 03:27:29.143]  Type in my name.
[03:27:29.303 --> 03:27:30.003]  Oh, he's not there.
[03:27:30.104 --> 03:27:30.644]  He's not there.
[03:27:30.684 --> 03:27:31.405]  We can't find him.
[03:27:32.606 --> 03:27:34.568]  10 different parody accounts are there.
[03:27:34.608 --> 03:27:35.248]  You can look at them.
[03:27:35.288 --> 03:27:37.590]  You can't look at my original verified account.
[03:27:37.951 --> 03:27:45.217]  Now it's got to the level, and I tweeted about this earlier, where they're shadow banning conservative members of Congress.
[03:27:45.358 --> 03:27:49.541]  Matt Gaetz and Alexander, who was just on the show, tweeted about this.
[03:27:50.182 --> 03:27:51.103]  He said, insanity.
[03:27:52.113 --> 03:27:59.101]  Both of Matt Gaetz's accounts have been taken out of not just the autocomplete, but won't even register when properly tagged.
[03:27:59.761 --> 03:28:05.588]  Government relations suicide considering the oversight powers he'll have if GOP remain retains House majority.
[03:28:06.289 --> 03:28:13.272]  So a Republican congressman now is being shadow banned by Twitter, and anyone can check this out.
[03:28:13.312 --> 03:28:14.572]  They can no longer hide it.
[03:28:14.872 --> 03:28:15.533]  It's obvious.
[03:28:15.913 --> 03:28:23.896]  You obviously had Project Veritas getting members of Twitter on record admitting this months ago, but Twitter denied it.
[03:28:23.936 --> 03:28:26.137]  They said, oh, it's just a few random outliers.
[03:28:26.497 --> 03:28:28.098]  No, they can't hide it anymore.
[03:28:28.498 --> 03:28:33.480]  This is clear political discrimination, which is why we're trying to bring this issue
[03:28:34.306 --> 03:28:36.489]  To the front and centre of Congressional hearings.
[03:28:36.529 --> 03:28:39.052]  To the front and centre of Parliamentary inquiries.
[03:28:39.332 --> 03:28:40.073]  Because as I've said...
[03:28:41.304 --> 03:28:45.206]  Algorithm manipulation can manipulate millions of people.
[03:28:45.446 --> 03:28:48.427]  It can change the outcome of entire elections.
[03:28:48.727 --> 03:28:49.907]  They've proven it in India.
[03:28:50.168 --> 03:28:52.408]  The biggest democratic election in history.
[03:28:52.789 --> 03:28:57.290]  They could manipulate the search results on Google and change the outcome of the election.
[03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:58.351]  This is massive.
[03:28:58.631 --> 03:29:00.191]  We need to continue to talk about it.
[03:29:00.231 --> 03:29:01.952]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:02.572 --> 03:29:06.614]  Any student of military history in all of recorded time
[03:29:07.554 --> 03:29:13.498]  We'll tell you that stealth and sneak attack is absolutely critical in any offensive war.
[03:29:14.779 --> 03:29:31.812]  The Democrats, the CHICOM's funding them, Hollywood, the whole EU unelected bureaucracy is in a combine against nation states and against free market capitalism in a global corporate takeover backed up by paramilitary UN force.
[03:29:32.572 --> 03:29:33.513]  NATO is their army.
[03:29:33.993 --> 03:29:34.394]  Right now!
[03:29:35.094 --> 03:29:37.295]  The Democrats are making their move.
[03:29:38.236 --> 03:29:47.081]  For the last year and a half, in policy papers, they said we're going to overthrow the President using the military, or using 25th Amendment, and we're going to build the case through made-up Russia collusion.
[03:29:47.601 --> 03:29:55.466]  When I would point out the white papers, they'd say, oh, that's crazy, it doesn't exist, because they wanted to build up their forces and get geared up and get ready to make their move.
[03:29:55.766 --> 03:30:00.469]  Now, that President Trump's been in a little over a year and a half, and we enter the summer of rage,
[03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:14.175]  Congressmen, Senators, former CIA Deputy Directors, FBI Deputy Directors, you name it, former CIA Directors, they're all over the news saying, we're making our move, Trump is a Russian agent, we're going to remove him from office.
[03:30:14.595 --> 03:30:25.640]  This is insane, and they've got a bunch of cowardly Republicans who want to sit on the fence, in case this coup is successful, going, oh yeah, maybe it is bad he met with Putin, maybe he is selling us out.
[03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:29.441]  Trump has been crushing Russia with our energy deals.
[03:30:29.861 --> 03:30:35.202]  Trump has been crushing Russia shipping heavy anti-tank weapons into Ukraine against the Russians.
[03:30:35.642 --> 03:30:37.463]  Trump has been putting massive sanctions on them.
[03:30:37.783 --> 03:30:42.124]  But his rhetoric is friendly to make Russia capitulate and make a deal.
[03:30:42.524 --> 03:30:45.805]  And quite frankly, it's offensive and probably not right what the president's doing.
[03:30:46.125 --> 03:30:49.586]  But you could see it in America's interest, but kind of in an imperial way.
[03:30:50.106 --> 03:30:52.288]  Trump is so pro-America, it's insane.
[03:30:52.348 --> 03:30:53.989]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[03:30:54.190 --> 03:30:55.411]  The economy's turning around.
[03:30:55.771 --> 03:31:01.936]  The traitors of globalism in the Democratic Party and the blue-blood Republicans are the ones that are anti-nation-state.
[03:31:02.276 --> 03:31:05.099]  They're the ones transferring power to the UN and the TPP.
[03:31:05.599 --> 03:31:06.700]  All the things Trump's killed.
[03:31:06.940 --> 03:31:14.585]  America was basically wearing a ball and chain, and Trump has removed it, and he's returning power back to the states, back to the people.
[03:31:14.825 --> 03:31:16.386]  He's acting as our real president.
[03:31:16.727 --> 03:31:19.308]  Even if you don't agree with some of what he says or does, it doesn't matter.
[03:31:19.589 --> 03:31:20.829]  He really is the president now.
[03:31:21.230 --> 03:31:28.354]  And the bureaucracy, and the lobbyists, and the globalists, and the chi-coms that own our debt and control Hollywood, thought they had this country.
[03:31:28.695 --> 03:31:33.918]  The communist Chinese newspapers admit they're at war with us right now, economically and building up militarily.
[03:31:34.198 --> 03:31:34.999]  They're the big threat.
[03:31:35.559 --> 03:31:37.883]  Russia can't even keep its own country together.
[03:31:38.183 --> 03:31:40.486]  It's being targeted by Soros just like we are.
[03:31:40.987 --> 03:31:45.774]  And that's the only truth in the Russian collusion, is that Russia has the same enemies that America has.
[03:31:46.254 --> 03:31:48.397]  And Russia is being targeted just like we are.
[03:31:48.678 --> 03:31:51.962]  And they're making their move against the President right now.
[03:31:52.563 --> 03:31:59.572]  They've been hyping it and, you know, pushing that they're going to remove him so long to get you punch drunk for when they finally make their move.
[03:31:59.933 --> 03:32:05.500]  But all of us, as Americans, need to understand they've tried to create race wars, class wars, sex wars.
[03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:07.202]  They've tried to divide us every way they can.
[03:32:07.482 --> 03:32:08.483]  They admit they're doing it.
[03:32:08.844 --> 03:32:09.745]  They are the globalists.
[03:32:09.805 --> 03:32:10.406]  They are the enemy.
[03:32:10.626 --> 03:32:25.495]  And it's up to us to call Congress, to call talk radio, to get involved more now than ever against all the internet censorship that they're trying to bring in ahead of a coup against the president and a coup against the electorate in this country that elected him.
[03:32:25.936 --> 03:32:34.381]  This is a war against America trying to have its own self-determination, just like Theresa May is trying to say they're not going to follow the vote for Brexit right now in England.
[03:32:34.861 --> 03:32:36.302]  Or Catalan in Spain.
[03:32:36.642 --> 03:32:38.142]  This fight is humanity's fight.
[03:32:38.382 --> 03:32:39.042]  It's your fight.
[03:32:39.242 --> 03:32:41.923]  And I stand with you at the brink of history.
[03:32:42.223 --> 03:32:44.604]  We're winning, but the enemy is counter striking.
[03:32:44.964 --> 03:32:52.547]  Whatever you do, take action and spread the link to Infowars.com forward slash show and let people know the battle to save America is happening now.
[03:32:52.887 --> 03:33:01.850]  And this is your wartime broadcast channel during this civil war between patriots of America and the globalists and their collaborating servants.
[03:33:05.706 --> 03:33:08.291]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:53.142 --> 03:33:54.570]  On my own, like Tarzan, boy
[03:33:57.871 --> 03:33:59.832]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:59.852 --> 03:34:03.933]  Before we go back to the news, I want to tell you about some of the specials at importwarsstore.com.
[03:34:04.293 --> 03:34:14.656]  Because again, the point I make over and over again, despite all this censorship, despite all this algorithm manipulation, despite all this shadow banning, they can't get to us with the boycotts.
[03:34:15.136 --> 03:34:27.440]  Just this morning, a George Soros front group opened up a new boycott campaign against Nigel Farage, trying to get him kicked off LBC, his main gig on what is mainstream radio here in the UK.
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:27.720]  OK.
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:29.541]  No particular reason for it.
[03:34:29.601 --> 03:34:30.661]  Oh, he's a right-wing bigot.
[03:34:31.342 --> 03:34:39.785]  Meanwhile, the guy pushing this, Owen Jones, literally three days ago on his own network, gave a platform to an admitted communist.
[03:34:40.225 --> 03:34:45.347]  He's saying that Nigel Farage is an extremist for talking about the issues he talks about.
[03:34:45.887 --> 03:34:48.108]  Nothing whatsoever he said is extremist.
[03:34:48.148 --> 03:34:50.949]  In fact, he's known as being quite mild on some issues.
[03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:52.050]  He gets criticised for that.
[03:34:52.842 --> 03:35:05.631]  Meanwhile, the guy behind this boycott campaign, Owen Jones, literally gives a platform to an admitted communist, somebody who advocates a system that killed at least 90 million people, if not more.
[03:35:06.012 --> 03:35:06.952]  So who's the extremist?
[03:35:07.793 --> 03:35:09.534]  Who's giving the extremists the platform?
[03:35:09.734 --> 03:35:12.456]  We're going to jump to Alex Jones, who wants to chime in with a comment here.
[03:35:12.536 --> 03:35:12.797]  Alex?
[03:35:14.037 --> 03:35:16.840]  Yes, Paul, I'm just driving down the road here along Lake Long.
[03:35:16.860 --> 03:35:20.082]  You were just making such a great point about all the censorship.
[03:35:21.116 --> 03:35:22.297]  Uh, and the things they're doing.
[03:35:22.417 --> 03:35:28.362]  Matt Gaetz has congressional hearings that he cleared for congressmen in good light last week.
[03:35:29.303 --> 03:35:35.168]  And they had YouTube go, yes, Alex Jones had his channel taken down for saying no one died at Parkland.
[03:35:36.129 --> 03:35:38.511]  Well, they said that, but our site was put back up.
[03:35:38.551 --> 03:35:39.271]  That was a lie.
[03:35:39.492 --> 03:35:40.292]  You know, we just said it.
[03:35:40.372 --> 03:35:41.233]  It's protected space.
[03:35:41.253 --> 03:35:41.713]  We didn't.
[03:35:42.954 --> 03:35:45.977]  And then Gaetz literally did over 100 interviews.
[03:35:46.477 --> 03:35:47.018]  On purpose.
[03:35:48.312 --> 03:35:54.857]  Uh, he didn't just get quoted saying that I said no one did it, even after it was admitted that I didn't say that.
[03:35:55.598 --> 03:36:01.803]  So it's just funny that he's being shadow banned now, uh, after he grovels to the system.
[03:36:01.843 --> 03:36:04.224]  And that's the point, is now congressional candidates.
[03:36:05.265 --> 03:36:10.309]  Trump, every Republican, every nationalist, is now being censored.
[03:36:11.250 --> 03:36:17.835]  Just like four months ago, News Corp said, you know, the new head of News Corp, uh, Disney bought it, said,
[03:36:18.846 --> 03:36:21.648]  We are going to ban Wikileaks and Alex Jones.
[03:36:22.469 --> 03:36:30.035]  Once that precedent is set, we're going to ban liberal, conservative, everybody, and we're going to make all this big profit off it.
[03:36:30.095 --> 03:36:35.840]  And you've got the dealer, you know, the head of Newsweek saying, we're going to have a pay internet now.
[03:36:36.381 --> 03:36:39.303]  This is their sick takeover happening right now.
[03:36:39.363 --> 03:36:40.304]  Back to you, Paul Watson.
[03:36:42.105 --> 03:36:46.810]  That's exactly right, Alex, and another facet of this censorship issue is Patreon.
[03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:54.918]  Patreon have banned the accounts of numerous people on the right, Conservatives, Libertarians, whoever, stopped their fundraising source at the source.
[03:36:55.539 --> 03:37:01.945]  Absolutely incredible double standard, given that Patreon, and this is in a new Breitbart article by Alan Bakari, which is
[03:37:03.092 --> 03:37:07.594]  Stripe, PayPal, Patreon, the right is being banned from online fundraising.
[03:37:08.015 --> 03:37:20.061]  Meanwhile, Patreon literally allows fundraising for Antifa groups, notedly called terrorist groups, designated terrorist groups by the Department of Homeland Security, by the FBI.
[03:37:20.401 --> 03:37:25.483]  They've literally put out FBI field reports of them stashing explosives on university campuses.
[03:37:26.004 --> 03:37:32.607]  There was an admitted acid attack targeting Trump supporters during the presidential inauguration.
[03:37:32.967 --> 03:37:34.448]  By an Antifa member.
[03:37:34.848 --> 03:37:36.808]  These people are allowed on Patreon.
[03:37:37.008 --> 03:37:40.249]  They're allowed to raise money for their admitted extremism.
[03:37:40.709 --> 03:37:43.890]  Meanwhile, anyone on the right is being banned by Patreon.
[03:37:43.930 --> 03:37:51.673]  And this is why people need to support us by getting the products out in 4WarsStore.com because we're not subject to those kind of boycott campaigns.
[03:37:52.113 --> 03:37:53.653]  We're funded only by you.
[03:37:53.713 --> 03:38:01.996]  This is how we've been able to survive for this long and to thrive in the face of all this underhanded, dirty tricks and the rest of it.
[03:38:02.586 --> 03:38:09.248]  So we've got numerous specials out in footballstore.com right now, including Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel.
[03:38:09.788 --> 03:38:13.629]  This addresses burns, scrapes, cuts and wounds, which are a natural part of life.
[03:38:13.669 --> 03:38:15.290]  And again, I was talking about this last week.
[03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:18.150]  I wore some new shoes, which are about a size too small.
[03:38:18.611 --> 03:38:21.151]  Totally scraped the skin off the back of my foot.
[03:38:21.211 --> 03:38:23.352]  This would have been, this would have come in handy for me.
[03:38:24.654 --> 03:38:27.676]  It is the Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel from InfoWars Life.
[03:38:27.696 --> 03:38:32.460]  You can reduce the threat of infection and irritation with a portable, affordable and easy-to-use solution.
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:38.744]  It's based on the powerful SilverSol technology that revolutionised the colloidal nano-silver market.
[03:38:39.244 --> 03:38:41.006]  It is Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel.
[03:38:41.566 --> 03:38:49.552]  It is available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, where we also have Super Silver Wound Gel bullet points.
[03:38:50.202 --> 03:38:54.629]  Which again is an advanced patented technology that has forever changed the colloidal nanosilver market.
[03:38:55.631 --> 03:38:58.235]  You can get that right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:38:58.255 --> 03:39:00.018]  Essentially it's armour for your wounds.
[03:39:00.519 --> 03:39:04.225]  It's the protective barrier that guards the wounds and helps keep them from getting infected.
[03:39:05.012 --> 03:39:06.893]  Again, you're going to need to buy this stuff anyway.
[03:39:06.933 --> 03:39:08.394]  Who doesn't use this stuff anyway?
[03:39:08.434 --> 03:39:10.455]  So why not buy it from us and support us?
[03:39:10.795 --> 03:39:13.597]  Because again, we're not subject to all these boycott campaigns.
[03:39:13.877 --> 03:39:21.080]  We're not subject to the mass organised outrage mobs that have taken down numerous other conservative outlets and commentators.
[03:39:21.521 --> 03:39:22.101]  We also have
[03:39:23.004 --> 03:39:26.826]  Defeat the Democrat censorship sale still ongoing with free shipping.
[03:39:27.247 --> 03:39:32.029]  That's up to 67% off storewide right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:39:48.709 --> 03:39:52.033]  We are able to thrive, we're able to prosper, but only to a certain extent.
[03:39:52.073 --> 03:39:53.395]  We need your support more than ever.
[03:39:53.415 --> 03:39:54.816]  They're coming for us more than ever.
[03:39:54.836 --> 03:40:01.364]  You've seen the intensification of the attacks against us, so please get the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:40:02.465 --> 03:40:06.470]  Now we've got about three minutes left in this segment, so I want to get into what happened in Toronto quickly.
[03:40:07.518 --> 03:40:12.662]  So it took them about 24 hours, at least, to name the culprit in the Toronto shooting.
[03:40:12.702 --> 03:40:15.804]  Again, two girls killed, aged 10 and 18.
[03:40:16.284 --> 03:40:26.552]  Fourteen others injured during this attack on a restaurant area in the Greek Christian Orthodox area of Toronto, known as Greek Town, on Sunday night.
[03:40:27.609 --> 03:40:41.380]  After an almost 24-hour delay in releasing his name, as soon as Hussein, his name is Faisal Hussein, was publicly identified, his family, and lawyers noted this, his family released a statement that sounded like it had been written by a lawyer, okay?
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:53.930]  This was not coming directly from the family, this is what they'd been told to put out, immediately claiming that he had mental issues, that he had depression, and that was the only motivation behind his rampage.
[03:40:54.571 --> 03:40:56.813]  Absolute unbridled BS.
[03:40:57.808 --> 03:41:01.969]  Of course, the left comes out after every mass shooting, whether it be in Canada or the US.
[03:41:02.730 --> 03:41:09.652]  If it's a white guy, they immediately come out and say, how dare you not categorise this as terrorism?
[03:41:10.172 --> 03:41:16.614]  Even though, if it becomes obvious very quickly, it has no connection to political motivations whatsoever, okay?
[03:41:16.774 --> 03:41:21.636]  To be a terrorist attack, it has to be either religiously or politically motivated.
[03:41:21.856 --> 03:41:22.576]  We're not saying
[03:41:23.368 --> 03:41:26.469]  That the victims didn't suffer terror from what happened.
[03:41:26.709 --> 03:41:31.071]  We're saying it wasn't a terrorist attack in the terms of the very definition of terrorism.
[03:41:31.351 --> 03:41:31.631]  Okay?
[03:41:31.931 --> 03:41:33.692]  This one looks like it was.
[03:41:34.732 --> 03:41:42.815]  The Toronto Sun's Joe Warmington has spoken to his law enforcement sources and he said they're still looking at a potential jihadi-inspired mission.
[03:41:43.796 --> 03:41:51.919]  Files being reviewed by police include concern Hussein expressed support for a website that was seen as pro-ISIS, a police source told Warmington.
[03:41:52.620 --> 03:42:02.058]  Intelligence officials are also looking at residences Hussein had in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as other online activities that suggest he may have been radicalised.
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:03.361]  So again,
[03:42:04.232 --> 03:42:15.479]  They came out, in fact you had journalists, you had Canadian journalists come out and express absolute horror at the fact that this wasn't a white guy because it meant they couldn't immediately run with this narrative.
[03:42:15.839 --> 03:42:23.503]  They were more angry over Fox News suggesting that this may have been a terrorist attack than they were the terrorist attack itself.
[03:42:23.903 --> 03:42:30.067]  So again, despite the fact that law enforcement say this guy was pro-ISIS, he visited jihadist websites,
[03:42:30.706 --> 03:42:36.608]  He had houses in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but this obviously looks like an Islamic terror motivated attack.
[03:42:37.128 --> 03:42:40.229]  Despite all that, the media has largely buried it.
[03:42:40.449 --> 03:42:48.391]  They ran with this PR statement written by a lawyer for the family that said it was just mental illness, and now they're hoping that everybody's gonna move on.
[03:42:48.431 --> 03:42:49.411]  Well, we're not gonna move on.
[03:42:49.431 --> 03:42:56.393]  We're gonna continue to look at this and try and get to the bottom of it and stop them from covering up what looks like an Islamic terror attack.
[03:42:57.013 --> 03:43:05.141]  The deep state is making its move.
[03:43:05.781 --> 03:43:13.428]  Multiple members of Congress, the FBI, the CIA are all on television saying we need the military to remove the president.
[03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:19.413]  We need a coup in this country, bare minimum 25th amendment, to remove him from office.
[03:43:19.454 --> 03:43:19.794]  And why?
[03:43:20.254 --> 03:43:33.350]  Because he went and had a summit, a year and a half plus into office, that he should have had a month into office, with Vladimir Putin, and met with him privately, just like he did with Theresa May, and dozens of other world leaders, like the communist Chinese dictator.
[03:43:33.651 --> 03:43:36.674]  Think about that, calling it treason, calling it traitorous.
[03:43:37.637 --> 03:43:45.423]  That Trump was nice to Putin in his language, when in truth, Trump has been crushing Russia with expanded U.S.
[03:43:45.483 --> 03:43:50.326]  energy sales, by shipping missiles into Ukraine to fight the Russians, with all these sanctions.
[03:43:50.446 --> 03:43:51.227]  It's incredible!
[03:43:51.587 --> 03:43:52.808]  But here's the big takeaway.
[03:43:53.488 --> 03:43:55.810]  Hiding in plain view that they hope you don't pay attention to.
[03:43:56.090 --> 03:43:58.292]  The Democrats are the party of globalism.
[03:43:59.488 --> 03:44:11.077]  Along with the blue-blood Republicans like George Herbert Walker Bush and his New World Order speech, globalism is about taking national sovereignty away and transferring it to the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN.
[03:44:11.897 --> 03:44:13.098]  The EU is unelected.
[03:44:13.699 --> 03:44:16.061]  It's in a trade war with us with giant tariffs on us.
[03:44:16.821 --> 03:44:18.742]  Canada, China, they all have huge tariffs.
[03:44:18.782 --> 03:44:19.722]  We have nothing on them.
[03:44:20.182 --> 03:44:22.843]  Trump is 100% fighting for the country.
[03:44:23.083 --> 03:44:24.623]  The country's coming back from the dead.
[03:44:25.443 --> 03:44:26.444]  It's America first.
[03:44:26.764 --> 03:44:31.165]  Our military, our borders, our everything, that's what you do when you strengthen the nation.
[03:44:31.605 --> 03:44:33.586]  The globalists are about weakening the nation.
[03:44:34.066 --> 03:44:34.526]  Democrat,
[03:44:35.687 --> 03:44:40.991]  Appellate court, Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in schools on the West Coast because it's a hate symbol.
[03:44:41.512 --> 03:44:42.633]  They hate flyover country.
[03:44:42.793 --> 03:44:43.754]  They hate bitter clingers.
[03:44:44.274 --> 03:44:45.675]  The universities hate America.
[03:44:45.836 --> 03:44:46.676]  They hate free speech.
[03:44:47.017 --> 03:44:48.878]  They're the party of globalism.
[03:44:49.179 --> 03:44:51.020]  They're the party of the New World Order.
[03:44:51.260 --> 03:44:57.346]  They're the party of destroying America's sovereignty, breaking our families up, demoralizing us, creating racial strife.
[03:44:57.566 --> 03:44:58.527]  It's all in the WikiLeaks!
[03:44:58.867 --> 03:45:00.129]  They're the ones of fake news.
[03:45:00.209 --> 03:45:01.530]  They're the ones that rig the debates.
[03:45:01.610 --> 03:45:04.973]  They're the ones that steal billions of dollars and launder money with their foundations.
[03:45:05.013 --> 03:45:11.199]  They're the ones caught in child sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein and Lolita Express and all the rest of it.
[03:45:11.580 --> 03:45:12.240]  They're the enemy.
[03:45:12.981 --> 03:45:31.174]  And then they turn around and point their finger at Trump, who's clearly America first, classic Americana, and the country coming back from the dead, and say because he met with the second biggest nuclear arms country in the world, he better be meeting with him and talking to him, that he's a traitor, and that the military needs to remove him?
[03:45:31.834 --> 03:45:33.996]  That sounds like something out of the old Soviet Union!
[03:45:34.916 --> 03:45:37.700]  Just like the left's calling for me to be banned and taken off the air.
[03:45:38.060 --> 03:45:39.122]  They openly admit it.
[03:45:39.562 --> 03:45:41.004]  They are the clear and present danger.
[03:45:41.365 --> 03:45:42.166]  They're the globalists.
[03:45:42.226 --> 03:45:43.047]  They're the deep state.
[03:45:43.327 --> 03:45:48.313]  And now this hype even has some conservatives going, well, I guess he should have been tougher on Putin.
[03:45:48.594 --> 03:45:50.035]  Yeah, we're a nation.
[03:45:50.296 --> 03:45:51.317]  We're sovereign.
[03:45:51.557 --> 03:45:52.939]  We're being taken over by Russia.
[03:45:53.780 --> 03:45:56.761]  Russia has the same enemy as us, George Soros.
[03:45:56.781 --> 03:46:05.603]  A lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros, for instance, with multi-billion, but does that make him, his posture, the posture of the United States?
[03:46:05.943 --> 03:46:09.264]  It's the multinationals working with the chi-coms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[03:46:09.804 --> 03:46:12.665]  It's Hollywood owned by the chi-coms trying to overthrow the U.S.
[03:46:13.005 --> 03:46:14.425]  Not the Russians and not Trump.
[03:46:14.785 --> 03:46:16.946]  If the Russians were doing any of this, I'd be their enemy.
[03:46:17.306 --> 03:46:17.906]  But they're not.
[03:46:18.326 --> 03:46:20.867]  They're trying to stabilize themselves just like we are.
[03:46:21.727 --> 03:46:24.388]  Every sovereign nation in the world is under globalist attack.
[03:46:25.028 --> 03:46:31.289]  Infowars is on the front lines fighting against that and promoting true open free societies and free market capitalism.
[03:46:31.489 --> 03:46:32.309]  And so is Trump.
[03:46:32.609 --> 03:46:36.550]  And I stand with him against all the bullies and all the followers and all the cowards.
[03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:40.071]  And I know we're going to continue to win thanks to all of you in the Infowars.
[03:46:40.271 --> 03:46:43.931]  But make no mistake, they're making their move and they are the enemy.
[03:46:44.271 --> 03:46:46.192]  They are the threat to this nation.
[03:46:47.292 --> 03:46:50.576]  It's sovereignty and our people's safety and prosperity.
[03:46:51.076 --> 03:46:54.199]  I'm Alex Jones, reporting for duty in the battle for the Republic.
[03:46:54.720 --> 03:46:55.621]  The year is 2018.
[03:46:56.482 --> 03:46:57.343]  History's happening now.
[03:46:57.823 --> 03:46:59.325]  Choose which side you're on.
[03:47:06.672 --> 03:47:09.315]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.153 --> 03:47:22.839]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.179 --> 03:47:26.883]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:29.338 --> 03:47:35.123]  We're live in this final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show up on Infowars.com.
[03:47:35.143 --> 03:47:36.544]  We have a big headline.
[03:47:37.064 --> 03:47:41.427]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[03:47:42.008 --> 03:47:42.969]  Sounds like a big number.
[03:47:43.029 --> 03:47:44.470]  Well, it's the UN's own numbers.
[03:47:45.230 --> 03:47:57.300]  The 2001 UN strategy document is getting fresh attention in light of the migrant crisis because it outlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of billions of migrants in order to maintain population levels.
[03:47:57.904 --> 03:48:01.106]  This is the same argument we hear over and over again.
[03:48:01.766 --> 03:48:03.067]  Fertility is collapsing.
[03:48:03.607 --> 03:48:04.788]  People are getting older.
[03:48:04.828 --> 03:48:05.909]  People are living longer.
[03:48:05.949 --> 03:48:07.870]  We need to replace them.
[03:48:08.110 --> 03:48:09.911]  They actually use the word replacement.
[03:48:10.231 --> 03:48:12.332]  This is a big bugbear of the left.
[03:48:12.372 --> 03:48:16.775]  They say, oh, only the alt-right talks about replacing white people, right?
[03:48:17.055 --> 03:48:17.435]  Well, no.
[03:48:17.795 --> 03:48:21.538]  The United Nations talks about it in this document from 2001.
[03:48:21.898 --> 03:48:27.201]  This is 17 years old now, but it's more relevant than ever.
[03:48:27.805 --> 03:48:29.627]  It's called replacement migration.
[03:48:29.667 --> 03:48:31.209]  That's literally what they call it.
[03:48:31.850 --> 03:48:34.213]  Is it a solution to declining and ageing populations?
[03:48:34.633 --> 03:48:40.480]  The plan seeks to offset population decline and population ageing, resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.
[03:48:41.454 --> 03:48:56.305]  So basically, they set out to answer who's going to fulfil all the pension obligations in Western countries, given that the population is getting older and older and governments are basically running out of money and can't fulfil those obligations.
[03:48:56.605 --> 03:48:59.968]  Their solution is to import hundreds of millions of migrants!
[03:49:00.628 --> 03:49:03.430]  Because they all get jobs and pay taxes, don't they?
[03:49:03.671 --> 03:49:04.411]  Well, no, they don't.
[03:49:04.871 --> 03:49:08.054]  In fact, I made a video, which is embedded in this article at the bottom,
[03:49:09.048 --> 03:49:17.770]  Call the truth about migrants 2018, which I put out last week, pointing to the fact that you can look at any of these countries, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, wherever.
[03:49:18.470 --> 03:49:23.091]  And in some cases, the majority of the population that's on benefits are migrants.
[03:49:23.792 --> 03:49:24.052]  Okay.
[03:49:24.352 --> 03:49:29.413]  In many cases, it takes them for in fact, I think is the Netherlands, where after four years,
[03:49:30.240 --> 03:49:32.962]  25% of migrants were in employment, the rest weren't.
[03:49:33.363 --> 03:49:44.272]  So this idea, this notion that we need to import vast numbers of people to pay the taxes, to do the menial labour jobs, doesn't even make sense because most of them are on welfare anyway.
[03:49:45.153 --> 03:49:53.480]  So this strategy document sets out six potential scenarios for each country or region of the world necessary to meet this goal of replacing the population.
[03:49:54.304 --> 03:49:57.526]  And they take each country in a case-by-case basis.
[03:49:57.586 --> 03:50:10.533]  If you look at the United States, and this is linked in the article, under the most extreme scenario, the report states it would be necessary, this is a quote, it would be necessary to have 593 million immigrants from 1995 to 2050, which is an average of 10.8 million a year.
[03:50:10.553 --> 03:50:11.694]  It goes on to say by 2050,
[03:50:20.183 --> 03:50:33.387]  Out of the United States' total population of 1.1 billion, which is what they imagine it to be in 2050, 775 million, or 73%, would be immigrants or their descendants.
[03:50:34.448 --> 03:50:35.488]  Then they look at Europe.
[03:50:35.528 --> 03:50:47.652]  They say, even in the lowest case scenario, one of the lowest case scenario, the document asserts that at least 159 million migrant workers will need to enter by 2025, which is now only seven years away,
[03:50:48.351 --> 03:50:51.854]  To maintain the current balance of four to five workers for a pensioner.
[03:50:52.935 --> 03:51:05.707]  Now in terms of the EU, the European Union, under the worst case scenario, they talk about 1.4 billion migrants being needed to flood Europe by 2050, which is an average of 25 million a year.
[03:51:07.577 --> 03:51:17.182]  And that would mean that Europe's population in 2050 would be 2.3 billion, of which 1.7 billion, almost three quarters, would be migrants or their descendants.
[03:51:17.562 --> 03:51:20.223]  This is an official UN strategy document from 2001.
[03:51:21.744 --> 03:51:24.965]  Obviously, these numbers are completely crazy, completely fantastical.
[03:51:25.766 --> 03:51:28.087]  It isn't anything like those levels yet.
[03:51:28.387 --> 03:51:33.990]  But again, it shows the motivation that they would even talk about this 17 years ago.
[03:51:34.010 --> 03:51:35.430]  And it has happened to some extent.
[03:51:36.051 --> 03:51:36.791]  Now, what we've had
[03:51:37.498 --> 03:51:53.443]  Two million plus migrants come into Europe over the past few years, above and beyond the ones that were coming in anyway, when they opened up the floodgates after this, you know, contrived media hoax about these refugees, when the vast majority of them were never refugees in the first place, they were economic migrants.
[03:51:54.301 --> 03:52:05.433]  You've had at least 2 million come into Germany alone, hundreds of thousands come into other European countries, and we've seen the problems that that's created in terms of integration or lack thereof.
[03:52:06.013 --> 03:52:14.362]  Sex crimes against women soaring, violent attacks on German citizens soaring, and in fact Reuters did a report a few months ago
[03:52:15.077 --> 03:52:21.800]  Where they confirmed that 90% of the increase in violent crime in Germany was responsible for migrants.
[03:52:22.180 --> 03:52:24.761]  Migrants were responsible for that 90% increase.
[03:52:25.441 --> 03:52:34.265]  So given the giant problems that we've had in Europe, not just with terror attacks, but with acid attacks, with sex attacks, with stabbings, etc, etc.
[03:52:34.565 --> 03:52:36.486]  I'm going to go on to talk about more of those in a second.
[03:52:37.366 --> 03:52:38.947]  That's just with a few million.
[03:52:39.671 --> 03:52:40.652]  Over the past few years.
[03:52:41.053 --> 03:52:45.397]  They're talking about 1.4 billion migrants entering Europe by 2050.
[03:52:45.477 --> 03:52:49.281]  That isn't just a security issue, it's a cultural issue.
[03:52:49.621 --> 03:52:52.424]  If you import Africa, you become Africa.
[03:52:53.024 --> 03:52:57.089]  It's bye-bye European culture, it's bye-bye Western civilization.
[03:52:57.309 --> 03:52:58.350]  That's just a fact.
[03:52:58.770 --> 03:53:01.513]  And here we have the UN talking about it as far back as 2001.
[03:53:03.530 --> 03:53:17.160]  Mirroring what French President Macron said recently when he argued that mass migration was Europe's destiny and that hundreds of millions of Africans will continue to flood into the continent, in his own words, for many years to come.
[03:53:17.701 --> 03:53:21.303]  Now if millions of Africans are flooding into Europe, Europe becomes Africa.
[03:53:21.523 --> 03:53:26.287]  That's not even debatable because these people aren't being integrated.
[03:53:26.707 --> 03:53:33.831]  Okay, you can have skilled, limited immigration and you can successfully integrate those people if it's done over a long stretch of time.
[03:53:34.111 --> 03:53:39.814]  If you have millions of people suddenly pouring in from an alien culture which has no respect for women,
[03:53:40.413 --> 03:53:45.877]  Which is a dominant, aggressively patriarchal culture, which is supposedly the thing that the left hates.
[03:53:46.397 --> 03:53:49.479]  But they've made an alliance with the Islamists to topple the West.
[03:53:49.999 --> 03:53:51.240]  Then you turn into that.
[03:53:51.661 --> 03:53:53.262]  OK, you can't integrate those people.
[03:53:53.522 --> 03:53:54.983]  You can't assimilate those people.
[03:53:55.323 --> 03:54:04.829]  The massive problems that Europe's having right now has proven that in triplicate, which is why even these welfare havens are now having to harden their borders in many cases.
[03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:06.731]  But this is the UN talking about it.
[03:54:07.011 --> 03:54:08.612]  As far back as 2001, it was their plan all along.
[03:54:11.394 --> 03:54:19.300]  Meanwhile in Italy, where they have actually imposed border controls, Italy's Matteo Salvini decries dirty business of illegal immigration.
[03:54:20.021 --> 03:54:24.985]  If governments do their job, he said, the dirty business of illegal immigration can be stopped.
[03:54:25.518 --> 03:54:27.138]  Now this is what's key about this article.
[03:54:27.598 --> 03:54:36.380]  Since Salvini imposed these proper border controls, actually having a border, having laws, migrant deaths have dropped dramatically.
[03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:41.762]  So having hot, strong border controls actually saves lives.
[03:54:41.842 --> 03:54:43.222]  It saves the lives of migrants.
[03:54:43.662 --> 03:54:48.343]  So when the left, when the fake virtue signallers whine and bitch all day about us,
[03:54:49.122 --> 03:54:52.606]  Having no emotions about us not caring about people's lives, no.
[03:54:52.926 --> 03:54:59.713]  You're the one who's responsible for these people dying because you said, come along, we can take you all, and what happened?
[03:54:59.993 --> 03:55:01.535]  People dying, people drowning.
[03:55:02.095 --> 03:55:07.260]  But as of the first week of July, migrant sea deaths in the Mediterranean numbered 1,058, which is less than half
[03:55:10.627 --> 03:55:15.649]  2,258 CVETs registered during the same six-month period of 2017.
[03:55:16.089 --> 03:55:29.914]  So because he's disincentivised them coming over in the first place, because he's disincentivised the NGOs working with the criminal people smugglers, he's saved half the amount of people who would have otherwise have died.
[03:55:31.054 --> 03:55:39.217]  Italy's immigration numbers have undergone a sharp decline thanks to its new populist government, and figures for the first half of the year reflect an 80% decline over the same period of 2017.
[03:55:40.740 --> 03:55:47.023]  So because he disincentivised them risking their lives and coming over in these boats, he saved their lives.
[03:55:47.183 --> 03:55:56.987]  He saved a thousand at least, a thousand lives as a result of having an actual border policy, which every other European government should now mirror.
[03:55:57.267 --> 03:56:08.352]  It's not only humanitarian, it's in the best interest of both the people coming from those countries, because generally they tend to be the middle class of those countries who can afford to pay the people smugglers to come over in the first place.
[03:56:09.013 --> 03:56:09.653]  So we're actually
[03:56:10.686 --> 03:56:20.132]  Fostering a brain drain in those countries, which is harming those countries, and we're fostering a rise in violent crime, sex attacks, lack of assimilation in our own countries.
[03:56:20.612 --> 03:56:24.035]  So having strong borders is a win-win for everybody.
[03:56:24.195 --> 03:56:27.717]  That's why we need to mirror Salvini's policy all across the continent.
[03:56:28.958 --> 03:56:30.639]  Otherwise you get situations like this.
[03:56:31.739 --> 03:56:37.263]  Headline, very low sentences for Afghan migrants after bloody gang rape of 13 year old girl in Sweden.
[03:56:37.802 --> 03:56:44.565]  Three Africans filmed and shared on social media their prolonged bloody group violence at the 13-year-old girl in Bastera, Sweden.
[03:56:45.125 --> 03:56:47.306]  So they basically raped this poor girl for hours.
[03:56:48.306 --> 03:56:50.807]  They were, I believe, 16, 17 years old.
[03:56:50.887 --> 03:56:51.908]  One of them was younger than that.
[03:56:52.645 --> 03:56:58.370]  They got eight months in juvenile detention, they appealed that, and now they get four months, okay?
[03:56:58.771 --> 03:57:11.502]  They're Somalis, but they've got Swedish nationality, so they literally get four months in juvenile detention for raping a girl, 13-year-old girl, to the point of her bleeding, traumatized for life.
[03:57:11.803 --> 03:57:15.306]  After four months in juvenile detention, they'll be out on the streets.
[03:57:15.586 --> 03:57:16.387]  That's Sweden.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:26.302]  That's who you don't want to be like, and that's why the Sweden Democrats are polling first place ahead of the national elections in Sweden coming up in September.
[03:57:26.942 --> 03:57:30.543]  Absolutely huge election, and we'll be sure to keep monitoring that.
[03:57:30.563 --> 03:57:33.264]  In fact, I'm going to have some guests on about that in the near future.
[03:57:33.724 --> 03:57:35.484]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour, though.
[03:57:35.504 --> 03:57:37.825]  Coming up, War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:38.045 --> 03:57:39.545]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:39.925 --> 03:57:41.426]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:41.626 --> 03:57:42.366]  Don't go away.
[03:57:52.341 --> 03:57:53.004]  It's all happening.
[03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:55.675]  Trump is a nationalist.
[03:57:56.719 --> 03:57:57.643]  The country's coming back.
[03:57:59.329 --> 03:58:07.615]  The globalist forces in this country, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans, are openly saying they want to remove him through a military coup, or through the 25th Amendment.
[03:58:07.715 --> 03:58:08.655]  It's unbelievable.
[03:58:08.995 --> 03:58:10.036]  It's all happening right now.
[03:58:10.536 --> 03:58:20.003]  That's why it's more important than ever that every viewer, every listener, to local radio, to TV, or over the internet, understand, your voice isn't just critical, it's essential.
[03:58:20.683 --> 03:58:28.829]  If you don't stand up and speak out, and stand up against these bullies, and point out that it's the globalists that are the ones that sold out America, not Trump, and that they're the enemy,
[03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:30.110]  They're the traitors.
[03:58:30.871 --> 03:58:32.874]  They may be successful removing our president.
[03:58:33.194 --> 03:58:35.557]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:36.058 --> 03:58:40.905]  Trump is so real, he's so hardcore, and it's so unbelievable to see that we are at this point.
[03:58:41.185 --> 03:58:43.628]  We are in the middle of the second American Revolution.
[03:58:44.009 --> 03:58:46.713]  This time, not against King George III, but against the globalists.
[03:58:47.153 --> 03:58:51.263]  We're running a special for a week that is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[03:58:51.283 --> 03:58:53.870]  We just keep boosting the sales.
[03:58:54.250 --> 03:58:54.431]  67% off.
[03:58:54.631 --> 03:58:56.295]  Up to 67% off.
[03:58:56.376 --> 03:58:59.664]  It's defeat the Democrat-slash-globalist plan to censor
