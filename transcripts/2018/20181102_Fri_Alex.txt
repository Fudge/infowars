[00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:08.339]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:22.164]  Four days until the November 6, 2018 election.
[00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:28.506]  And we've got the United Nations officially through its subgroups suing Trump
[00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:35.637]  And leftist federal judges standing by to claim we have no right to a border.
[00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:52.342]  The violent, armed, Molotov cocktail-throwing hordes, spun up and created at UN command bases in Central and South America, have a right to smash through Mexican police, smash through the borders, and be trucked in
[00:00:53.422 --> 00:01:01.746]  To the United States to arrive literally, literally a day and a half to two days before the first group set to hit McAllen, Texas.
[00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.267]  This is unbelievable.
[00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:11.111]  And Jon Stewart goes on CNN to make jokes and goes, Trump acts like this is Road Warrior beyond Thunderdome.
[00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.772]  There's nothing happening anywhere.
[00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:17.034]  No, the French interior minister said that France is basically already collapsed.
[00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.456]  And if they don't reverse things now, they'll be gone in five years, civilization.
[00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:28.581]  Thousands of cars burned tonight in Sweden and Germany and in Spain.
[00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.943]  Truck attacks, car murders, stabbings, acid attacks.
[00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:35.205]  Every country, sometimes seven a day is the average in England.
[00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:41.289]  It is just total carjacking, rape, murder, total insanity.
[00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.531]  Mexico's collapsed in most areas.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.101]  And they're there telling you that everything is fine.
[00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:56.503]  Like you showed some video yesterday, Crew, where they're driving in Germany down the road at night and there's just dozens of burning cars as you're driving through them.
[00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:03.325]  I mean, this is the total insanity lawlessness with the millions of people coming in with the big snakes.
[00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:10.186]  And that's all the United Nations run and coordinated.
[00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:12.427]  Federal government funds it.
[00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:14.456]  Big banks chip in.
[00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:15.557]  It goes to the U.N.
[00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:16.617]  The U.N.
[00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:17.737]  gives it to the NGOs.
[00:02:18.217 --> 00:02:19.778]  Soros doesn't spend his own money.
[00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:21.898]  Soros doesn't do that.
[00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:25.379]  And by the way, what's the big ultimate sin?
[00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.781]  It's to say who is funding.
[00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:36.462]  Oh, Lou Dobbs might get fired.
[00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.002]  He had judicial watch on.
[00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:41.167]  And they said that the U.S.
[00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:42.628]  should cut funding off the U.N.
[00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:43.748]  because it's the group running it.
[00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:46.609]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the Veritas bombshell.
[00:02:47.709 --> 00:03:06.074]  They went into the Beto O'Rourke campaign at the level next to the very highest level, where they discussed the head of the campaign coordinating, siphoning off the record, now $80-something million that Beto has gotten from Hollywood and the globalists,
[00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.455]  To bring the Honduran caravans in that they talk about already being in Texas.
[00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:18.040]  One thing Michael Moore said that was true is he said, oh, these caravans are always coming.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.763]  Yeah, they're getting more militarized, more out of control every day.
[00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:27.569]  James O'Keefe is joining us with world exclusive information at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.312]  We're going to be playing a lot of this footage, but guess what else?
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.963]  We have at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:39.747]  This really needs to go out worldwide because this isn't even hidden.
[00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.468]  But no one's covering this.
[00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.293]  UN MasterCard supplying migrants with prepaid bank cards.
[00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.894]  That's right, if you're an American patriot or pro-America or pro-gun, MasterCard won't let you bank online with them.
[00:03:53.194 --> 00:04:07.904]  But if you are armed, 80-plus percent military-age males that are throwing Molotov cocktails at police and putting people's eyes out, and you've got kidnapped kids with you, well then, they're absolutely all about it.
[00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:11.846]  This is from the United Nations itself.
[00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:15.008]  This isn't a press release by the UNHCR.
[00:04:18.547 --> 00:04:22.414]  Meanwhile Trump's on TV saying, well I feel like Soros and the UN might be involved.
[00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:28.978]  That's because Trump knows the public isn't even ready for this.
[00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:32.060]  We are under world government corporate invasion.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.123]  And if they break through with these groups, the next groups will be ten times bigger exponentially.
[00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:38.884]  It's all here.
[00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:39.485]  We have them.
[00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:43.387]  Oh, and guess who else Project Veritas found out is running Democrat campaigns?
[00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:45.268]  The CIA.
[00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:48.090]  Groups put behind by Obama.
[00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:48.891]  Oh!
[00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:50.012]  Oh!
[00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:50.932]  We'll be back!
[00:04:53.188 --> 00:05:03.114]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:03.174 --> 00:05:05.435]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:12.119]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:18.622]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:19.082 --> 00:05:24.685]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:32.369]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:46.079]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.362]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:53.565]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:07.396]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:20.444]  Four days.
[00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:22.625]  It's November 2nd, 2018.
[00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:26.387]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:30.230]  And this country is under coordinated
[00:06:31.184 --> 00:06:35.008]  Multinational combined cartel attack.
[00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:51.947]  The globalist shycomps, the unelected EU, the megabanks, the America-hating Hollywood propaganda corps, and giant third-world populations already fed on by the globalists, now weaponized and turned into political engines of destruction.
[00:06:52.961 --> 00:07:04.011]  And now, in hundreds of newspapers and on every comedy channel and on every late night comedy show, so many announcements, so many statements, I can't even watch them all.
[00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:13.861]  I've seen 30 plus articles today from the New York Times, the Washington Post, I've seen clips of Michael Moore on
[00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:25.862]  Nightly News and on late night shows saying white people are inherently bad and need to be removed from the face of the earth.
[00:07:26.202 --> 00:07:26.823]  Give up!
[00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:27.804]  Give up!
[00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:33.129]  Literally trying to invoke minorities who are 90% of the world population.
[00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:34.350]  Whites are minority globally.
[00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:45.351]  Weaponize and believe that literal, Hitler-level, race-based politics are good, and whites are inherently bad.
[00:07:48.813 --> 00:07:51.234]  This is just staggering.
[00:07:53.355 --> 00:08:02.441]  And you notice the progenitors, the leaders of this are almost exclusively white communists and socialists, who work for big megabanks, who are tax-exempt.
[00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:10.121]  All the big white billionaires all have tax-exempt schemes offshore and pay up to zero tax.
[00:08:11.903 --> 00:08:18.927]  Bono got in trouble only giving 0.8% of money he raised for Africans to them, so he went up to 1.1.
[00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.729]  98.9% of the billions goes right in his pocket.
[00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:24.291]  And I point that out
[00:08:30.103 --> 00:08:32.985]  Because you have to understand, these are monsters.
[00:08:35.107 --> 00:08:39.811]  If you look at where the most liberal people live, it is in the most white areas.
[00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:42.573]  They've done big national news stories, there's maps of it.
[00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.362]  These people are crazy.
[00:08:46.903 --> 00:08:52.227]  Hillary Clinton said blacks are animals that must be made to heal and are super predators.
[00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:53.068]  Should I play the clip?
[00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.229]  You know, I think I will.
[00:08:54.389 --> 00:09:03.176]  But first, let's play Oprah Winfrey, the only black person, other than Vernon Jordan,
[00:09:05.114 --> 00:09:21.712]  Who is allowed in to the yearly eugenics meeting in New York City that David Rockefeller always chaired with Ted Turner and all the rest of them where they openly discuss race-specific bioweapons to wipe out Africans.
[00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.776]  This woman is a monster.
[00:09:26.376 --> 00:09:26.996]  You're like, but wait a minute.
[00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:27.996]  She wants to get the whites.
[00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:29.556]  I'll play a clip of her saying that.
[00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:30.556]  Whites need to all die.
[00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:32.457]  Get rid of these white people.
[00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:33.057]  They need to die out.
[00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:34.077]  True white genocide statement.
[00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:37.458]  But then she really has a covert beyond the Nazi program.
[00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:48.100]  Because they're going after Europe and middle classes and uppity groups that can undermine a hegemonic centralized control.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.320]  A vertical integration.
[00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:58.197]  And then they target the third world, keep them de-industrialized, dumbed down, and then weaponize them racially and politically to come in and conquer the West.
[00:09:58.857 --> 00:10:03.078]  Then when the West is on its knees, burning, the bioweapons will be released.
[00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:11.021]  Within a matter of months, the world population will be reduced by 80% according to their operational guideline plans.
[00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:15.263]  I'm giving you the most classified information in the world right now.
[00:10:16.943 --> 00:10:17.703]  Which you just were told.
[00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:19.104]  I can even give you
[00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:22.099]  Places where they've slipped up and admitted it.
[00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:39.667]  And then I can give you the public admissions for their next level, below the actual command level, where they are given a false operational dogma that is still draconian, world population reduction, end of the family, we have to reduce world population through sterilization.
[00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:42.869]  That's the next level of need to know that it goes down from there.
[00:10:43.349 --> 00:10:46.610]  And you can see them now beginning to propagandize the levels below that.
[00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:51.753]  Everything I told you about 20 plus years ago is now becoming mainstream and they're mainlining it to you.
[00:10:53.323 --> 00:10:55.884]  As they prepare to go operational.
[00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:02.925]  Trump is hated because he believes we can go to space and have a civilization and bring everybody up.
[00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:11.047]  But he's going to be tough with the third world populations and tough with other groups that have already been weaponized for everyone's survival.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.408]  And he's going to be tough with the corrupt elites and the chi-coms and others.
[00:11:15.388 --> 00:11:19.289]  And he, along with a leadership group that's countervailing this,
[00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:24.626]  A believes you can't carry out this extermination and not have a nuclear war that comes as a side issue.
[00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:28.769]  And it's just too dangerous to even carry out the operation.
[00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:34.642]  Trump does not want to kill all the black people and all the Hispanics and all the Asians.
[00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:37.063]  He believes in unlimited expansion.
[00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:39.325]  So you're being given what's really going on.
[00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:47.471]  Oprah Winfrey goes to meetings with the top world leaders and even leaks that they're establishing world government to carry out forced population reduction.
[00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:48.772]  That's in the London Guardian.
[00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:50.233]  That's in the Associated Press.
[00:11:50.513 --> 00:11:51.333]  That's the plan.
[00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:55.857]  There is only two black people that are allowed in these meetings.
[00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.587]  With hundreds of billionaires.
[00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:04.430]  And then Michael Moore sits up there and says, whites are inherently bad.
[00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.971]  What's that got to do with whites?
[00:12:07.672 --> 00:12:09.573]  It's going to make them become super racist.
[00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:11.894]  And then they're all going to get persecuted.
[00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:16.076]  And then people will go along with this.
[00:12:16.217 --> 00:12:17.757]  But most whites are going to get wiped out as well.
[00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.339]  But you see, here's the larger operation.
[00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.883]  More and people know what they're doing.
[00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:36.884]  They want a ticket in the bunkers, luxury bunkers, swimming pools, shopping centers, everything that we built, the taxpayers.
[00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:39.386]  They want their golden ticket into those things.
[00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:42.127]  You're never going to get into those, Moore.
[00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:44.869]  Hillary, all of you, your plan's blown.
[00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:45.809]  You'll never pull it off.
[00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.990]  You'll never execute it.
[00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:52.253]  But you have to understand, Michael Moore is a monster.
[00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:55.129]  Oprah Winfrey is a monster.
[00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:57.690]  These are monstrous evil people.
[00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:02.512]  Trump has to first give America its identity, that it's okay to have a country.
[00:13:02.912 --> 00:13:04.053]  It's okay to be proud of yourself.
[00:13:04.373 --> 00:13:10.056]  And then we're all together unifying around liberty and freedom and justice, things that Martin Luther King totally agreed with.
[00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:19.720]  They have rejected that and overthrown it, but you have to destroy that idea by posing as if you're it, but if you actually look at it, it's 180 degrees the opposite.
[00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:28.226]  Michael Moore calls on angry white American guys to give it up because they're demographically doomed.
[00:13:28.246 --> 00:13:33.247]  See, they're making it about demographics, not about being Christian or being capitalist or being exceptionalist.
[00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:37.748]  They are fanatical about this because they know their time is up.
[00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:42.930]  Oh, when the Republicans finally took over and ended Jim Crow and all that 40 years ago?
[00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.270]  Yeah.
[00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:45.636]  You guys are sick filth.
[00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:50.359]  He used to claim he represented poor white guys losing all their jobs up in Michigan and poor blacks.
[00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:51.160]  He doesn't now.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.362]  The establishment hates blacks even more than they hate poor white people.
[00:13:55.062 --> 00:13:59.666]  And what you're getting is the total truth and everybody knows it deep down and you know it at your intellectual level.
[00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:03.168]  So remember, are we good enough to understand these monsters?
[00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:03.968]  Yes.
[00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:05.369]  That's why they're censoring us.
[00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.933]  Because we red pill more people than anybody but Trump.
[00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:13.135]  Now let's go ahead and play a clip of Oprah Winfrey.
[00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.432]  Sam, we need all these old white people to die.
[00:14:16.452 --> 00:14:16.973]  They're old.
[00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:17.693]  They're bad.
[00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:19.455]  That's Nazi talk.
[00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:20.276]  They're just all bad.
[00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:20.977]  We need them to die.
[00:14:21.017 --> 00:14:21.337]  Here it is.
[00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:26.201]  As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem's not solved.
[00:14:26.602 --> 00:14:36.691]  There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.
[00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.211]  They just have to die.
[00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:50.060]  Meanwhile, she meets with the most racist, hardcore leaders of the BioPort, of the Cold Springs Harbor, the people that founded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, that created Hitler.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.162]  She is on the team.
[00:14:54.343 --> 00:14:56.765]  And it's just incredible.
[00:14:56.805 --> 00:15:04.831]  When we come back, Michael, the Pig Goblin, Moore, and others are just... The New York Times, everything is just white, surrenderingly evil.
[00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:05.572]  We've got to get rid of them.
[00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.608]  And it's not even good to be a friend with a white person.
[00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:12.032]  And then it's otherwise going, yes, you're right, we're inherently evil.
[00:15:12.293 --> 00:15:23.487]  This is the most Hitlerian bizarreness that anyone could ever imagine, and it just comes out of these ultra-rich, race-baiting, class-baiting trash.
[00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:31.762]  But see, they have trouble getting people to get into class warfare, because immigrants coming here want to become successful and independent and wealthy, or follow their dreams.
[00:15:32.302 --> 00:15:35.204]  So the class warfare isn't working because Venezuela and everywhere else fails.
[00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:37.386]  So now they're just going to go, let's just go with race.
[00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:39.548]  Pure racial identity politics.
[00:15:39.588 --> 00:15:40.368]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:41.649]  We have their battle plans.
[00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.671]  And then now it's all over the news.
[00:15:44.071 --> 00:15:45.312]  They're trying to start a race war.
[00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:46.473]  Every movie, every show.
[00:15:46.733 --> 00:15:49.616]  These people are psychological terrorists.

[00:19:56.261 --> 00:20:00.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.207 --> 00:20:20.369]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:35.630]  The reason I am the most deplatformed person in the world, and under unmitigated continual attack, is because I've done my research, I have the best sources, and I'm on target.
[00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.991]  And I believe in humanity.
[00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:39.152]  I believe in you.
[00:20:39.992 --> 00:20:44.395]  And so, we're laying out incredibly frightening information here.
[00:20:45.715 --> 00:20:46.976]  Because it's incredibly true.
[00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:49.398]  But it's not to scare you.
[00:20:50.238 --> 00:20:58.843]  It's so that you know what's going on and you have a chance to speak out and get involved and outside the Hollywood mind control bubble and realize what's happening.
[00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:01.424]  They think you're stupid.
[00:21:02.044 --> 00:21:02.745]  That's an understatement.
[00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:15.712]  The UN openly in Europe and openly in Central and South America and North America has been running the breakdown plan has been running the breakdown plan
[00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:29.969]  To open up our borders and conquer nation-states by the UN controlling billions of unwashed, uneducated, violent, brainwashed, third-world populations.
[00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.949]  Period.
[00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:37.415]  Because the UN manages and runs these groups, because leftist groups manage and run these groups in the client countries.
[00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:42.720]  Once the UN gets them into your nation, they then control them.
[00:21:44.491 --> 00:22:10.530]  And of course, inside the Beto campaign, Project Veritas got the video of them saying, from the highest levels of the campaign, we are giving them credit cards, prepaid credit cards, everything, hiring them transportation, giving them food at every stop of the way, and they're already giving Hondurans, that's code for Venezuelans, the aid packages when they got to the Texas border.
[00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.412]  And this was shot recently.
[00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.571]  There's already caravans in McAllen every day.
[00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:23.133]  Five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, we shot the video and showed the locals admitting it.
[00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:24.273]  We broke it.
[00:22:24.934 --> 00:22:27.134]  Drudge Report broke it nationally.
[00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:30.716]  So when I get up here and I say this is the U.N.
[00:22:31.096 --> 00:22:32.936]  and they go, oh my God, Jones is insane.
[00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:33.677]  He says the U.N.
[00:22:33.717 --> 00:22:34.697]  and Soros are involved.
[00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:40.179]  It's like saying that turkeys are involved with Thanksgiving.
[00:22:42.938 --> 00:22:45.139]  Or that football's involved with the NFL.
[00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.160]  Or that Superman wears a stupid red cape.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.481]  I mean, this is... Now they're saying the caravan doesn't exist.
[00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:53.241]  But that didn't work the last few days.
[00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:57.483]  So now they're saying, okay, there's always been caravans, and it's illegal to stop them.
[00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:00.104]  And the UN is funding lawsuits against Trump.
[00:23:00.344 --> 00:23:06.946]  And watch, you'll have some federal judges say, you've got to let them come on through and physically kill police and military and bearded by over the head.
[00:23:06.966 --> 00:23:08.227]  And Trump's a terrorist.
[00:23:08.507 --> 00:23:11.007]  He can't put people in temporary tents before he ships them back.
[00:23:11.408 --> 00:23:11.868]  Which is Rex 84.
[00:23:14.718 --> 00:23:22.484]  Which the left spun, and I misunderstood 25 years ago when I was researching, was Reagan's plan for martial law and putting everybody in camps.
[00:23:22.544 --> 00:23:39.877]  No, it was the communists had a plan, the Democrats they discovered, to trigger revolutions in Latin America and get communists in, and then flood up with tens of millions of people collapsing the Southwest, and then causing riots, race-based riots nationwide, and Ronald Reagan said, that ain't happening, Jack!
[00:23:40.137 --> 00:23:41.358]  Get a plan ready to stop it!
[00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:45.550]  And Trump just implemented RECS 84.
[00:23:46.831 --> 00:23:50.032]  The UN and the globalists started all this.
[00:23:53.034 --> 00:23:54.435]  State of national emergency.
[00:23:54.695 --> 00:23:55.555]  What did I tell you?
[00:23:56.576 --> 00:24:04.901]  The day they smashed over the Mexican border and attacked the police, I said this is UN run and Trump will declare an emergency next Monday.
[00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:10.924]  But the details will remain classified because these operations aren't classified.
[00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:13.463]  I don't think the U.N.
[00:24:13.763 --> 00:24:18.665]  and the traitors in our government, the stay-behind CIA networks, don't all know this information as well.
[00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:22.026]  So they know how to try to stop the Readiness Plan.
[00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:28.289]  That's why you better believe Trump isn't just going to go with the original plans to stop this U.N.
[00:24:28.349 --> 00:24:29.249]  communist invasion.
[00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.711]  They want to break our will.
[00:24:33.051 --> 00:24:34.191]  They want to break our borders.
[00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:38.433]  And you better believe John Brennan and Clapper and all of these dirtbags are behind it.
[00:24:38.673 --> 00:24:40.414]  And Brennan is commanding Beethoven.
[00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:45.011]  Brennan is his National Security Advisor.
[00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:46.573]  I can tell you that's secret information.
[00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:48.875]  But now it's not.
[00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:54.259]  And you notice that Beto is now quarterbacking the invasion point being Texas.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.663]  They've chosen Southern California, but they want to have the clash.
[00:24:58.703 --> 00:25:00.085]  So they've chosen McCallum.
[00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.147]  Nobody needs to know.
[00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.632]  Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies for caravans and aliens.
[00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:17.375]  Hell, the UN just announced hundreds of millions MasterCard supplying migrants with UN funding with prepaid bank cards.
[00:25:18.276 --> 00:25:20.837]  NewsWars.com right now!
[00:25:22.025 --> 00:25:27.870]  Now, coming up, we're going to have the exclusive breakdown with the amazing James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:28.471]  It was on this break.
[00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:33.255]  But here's some of the boil-down of the incredible footage they caught just days ago in Texas.
[00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:35.397]  Beto, under U.N.
[00:25:35.837 --> 00:25:42.604]  command, working for Soros, breaching Texas's walls, literally assaulting us as an operative.
[00:25:42.764 --> 00:25:43.124]  Here it is.
[00:25:43.504 --> 00:25:44.125]  What's happening?
[00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:44.806]  What's happening?
[00:25:45.426 --> 00:25:48.569]  So there's, like, uh, you know, that migrant caravan?
[00:26:17.652 --> 00:26:24.095]  Dominique Chacon is a field manager for the Beto O'Rourke Senate campaign in the campaign's headquarters in El Paso.
[00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:28.678]  He got the tip about the migrants and marshaled the campaign staff to act.
[00:26:29.318 --> 00:26:32.820]  Whether or not it was legal did not seem to concern him.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.863]  I have a clear distance between me organizing riots and the campaign.
[00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:47.458]  I'm turning my attention to the Lone Star State.
[00:26:47.659 --> 00:26:50.800]  Congressman Beto O'Rourke, a rising Democratic star.
[00:26:50.961 --> 00:26:57.344]  The kind of bitterness and name-calling and partisanship that has, unfortunately, defined so much of the national conversation.
[00:26:57.444 --> 00:27:02.948]  You can add more to it, or you can stay focused on the future and why you did this in the first place.
[00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:06.670]  We're not allowed to organize rides, and that's a huge, like, legal inability.
[00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.253]  So they wouldn't let us do that, like, and so I just went around and did it according to this other email.
[00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:13.054]  But make it sort of documented.
[00:27:13.515 --> 00:27:14.659]  Can I have your driver's license?
[00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:15.181]  Yeah.
[00:27:15.723 --> 00:27:16.868]  And then being nice.
[00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.835]  And then being professional.
[00:27:22.523 --> 00:27:26.425]  I'm James O'Keefe here in El Paso, Texas, on the Mexico-United States border.
[00:27:26.866 --> 00:27:31.268]  Our latest investigation is on Beto O'Rourke, and this one is a blockbuster.
[00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:47.558]  These videos you're about to see appear to show Beto's campaign workers and staff, all the way up to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, knowingly using campaign resources and funds to help assist subsidized illegal aliens entering the United States.
[00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:50.118]  Some of them from the migrant caravan.
[00:27:50.138 --> 00:27:52.259]  Now, a lot of serious legal issues in this video.
[00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:58.240]  Section 1001 violations, FEC violations, a lot of serious questions that need to be answered.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.240]  The voters of Texas are going to want those answers from Beto O'Rourke.
[00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:03.881]  Check this out.
[00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:06.581]  Let's stop right there.
[00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.321]  They're getting the real meat and potatoes there.
[00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:10.942]  The full videos, hours of it, are on Infowars.com.
[00:28:10.962 --> 00:28:12.942]  We're coming up with James O'Keefe on the other side.
[00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:13.742]  But here's the key.
[00:28:14.603 --> 00:28:15.683]  It's compartmentalized.
[00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:17.003]  And they've got this in more offices.
[00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:20.922]  You notice he's telling the low-levels, oh, it's my idea, do this.
[00:28:21.662 --> 00:28:24.883]  You know, here's the prepaid cards, here's the food we're going to get them.
[00:28:25.183 --> 00:28:26.523]  And they ask, is this okay?
[00:28:26.803 --> 00:28:28.564]  He goes, oh yeah, the head of the campaign knows.
[00:28:28.864 --> 00:28:29.364]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:34.005]  We have the UN press release about the prepaid credit cards and all of it.
[00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:41.307]  And I've been down to McAllen over and over again, where the buses come in and the Border Patrol's ordered by Obama, executive order in the UN, to allow this to happen.
[00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:46.549]  Trump has ended that, so now they're going to just slam across the border with force, like they did in Mexico.
[00:28:46.969 --> 00:28:48.911]  This is treason by O'Rourke!
[00:28:49.091 --> 00:28:50.193]  Literal treason!
[00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:51.054]  He should be arrested!
[00:28:55.464 --> 00:28:57.645]  I mean, these people get mailed these devices.
[00:28:57.725 --> 00:28:59.306]  It turns out they're fake devices.
[00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:03.008]  And it's all over the news that, oh my God, Trump's got to be impeached.
[00:29:03.428 --> 00:29:05.309]  You know, his hateful rhetoric's causing it.
[00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:10.992]  Anybody could mail themselves something, or have it delivered, and then say they're a victim.
[00:29:11.032 --> 00:29:12.512]  And it starts in the hierarchy of the Democrats.
[00:29:12.532 --> 00:29:14.893]  George Soros, the Clintons, Obama, right down.
[00:29:15.214 --> 00:29:17.255]  I mean, take this package that got mailed to me today.
[00:29:17.275 --> 00:29:18.115]  Dr. McCambshot, please.
[00:29:19.256 --> 00:29:19.796]  I mean, right here.
[00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:21.396]  What is this?
[00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:22.017]  They were telling me.
[00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:24.098]  I mean, did a Democrat mail this to me?
[00:29:24.118 --> 00:29:26.040]  Because it says Alex Jones.
[00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:31.024]  Hillary Clinton, 50 Dark Heart Lane, Globalist California, 90666.
[00:29:32.485 --> 00:29:34.547]  How in the hell do they have our real address?
[00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:37.669]  Gosh, that even looks more real than what they mailed.
[00:29:37.749 --> 00:29:39.650]  And of course, just like CNN did.
[00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.292]  We're not going to treat this like it's a real bomb.
[00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:42.273]  Let's just get right in here.
[00:29:42.953 --> 00:29:44.534]  Wow, that looks a lot more real.
[00:29:44.834 --> 00:29:46.176]  Whoa, Hillary's face is on it.
[00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:47.857]  That means she sent it.
[00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.671]  They put right-wing stuff on there, whatever that means, the right-wing Senate.
[00:29:51.991 --> 00:29:52.872]  Hillary sent this.
[00:29:52.912 --> 00:29:53.712]  Her picture's on it.
[00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.393]  Clearly, Democrats just sent me this bomb.
[00:29:56.633 --> 00:29:57.514]  Oh my gosh, what is this?
[00:29:57.534 --> 00:29:58.554]  They just dynamite.
[00:29:58.894 --> 00:29:59.895]  Twin dynamites.
[00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:00.895]  Here in Austin.
[00:30:00.975 --> 00:30:02.076]  We've been sent dynamite.
[00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:02.576]  Hold on, Alex.
[00:30:02.596 --> 00:30:02.776]  Hold on.
[00:30:02.796 --> 00:30:03.036]  No, no.
[00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:05.097]  In fact, whoever sent this is a bomber.
[00:30:05.497 --> 00:30:06.378]  Doesn't matter it's fake.
[00:30:06.618 --> 00:30:07.618]  Doesn't matter it's satire.
[00:30:07.838 --> 00:30:09.879]  Doesn't matter it didn't really happen.
[00:30:10.139 --> 00:30:11.060]  The clock is ticking.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.640]  There's a clock.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.001]  Hillary's picture's on it.
[00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:14.661]  These aren't road flares.
[00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:15.842]  These are TNT dynamite.
[00:30:15.962 --> 00:30:17.963]  Hillary Clinton tried to bomb Infowars.
[00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:20.185]  Okay, Owen, you were sent this to Alex Jones.
[00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:20.906]  Hold on, Alex.
[00:30:20.926 --> 00:30:25.551]  Look at what the... This is to Alex Jones, but from Soros Headquarters.
[00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:26.932]  Alex, read that.
[00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:27.312]  What is that?
[00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:31.977]  Soros Headquarters, 666 Hale Highway, Bathamette, New York.
[00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:32.918]  Oh my gosh, and look at this.
[00:30:32.938 --> 00:30:34.600]  This actually came in the priority mail.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.542]  This is an official priority mail box.
[00:30:36.662 --> 00:30:38.103]  Clearly official.
[00:30:38.164 --> 00:30:40.005]  I mean, look at how... I mean, Alex...
[00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:41.506]  This is amazing.
[00:30:41.827 --> 00:30:42.947]  This was just dropped off.
[00:30:43.127 --> 00:30:44.808]  George Soros sent me a bomb.
[00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.429]  This was just dropped off by the mail.
[00:30:46.449 --> 00:30:47.209]  Let's look in it now.
[00:30:47.229 --> 00:30:48.150]  Or somebody in his house did.
[00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:48.590]  I don't know.
[00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.090]  It just got dropped off by the mail.
[00:30:50.151 --> 00:30:50.651]  Okay, whoa!
[00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:52.352]  I'm not even worried about it.
[00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:53.012]  Oh my gosh!
[00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:53.892]  Oh, another bomb?
[00:30:53.912 --> 00:30:54.493]  Oh my gosh!
[00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:57.894]  And look, it's got a microchip on it.
[00:30:57.914 --> 00:30:58.875]  It's got some circuitry.
[00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:00.395]  It's counting down here.
[00:31:00.415 --> 00:31:01.536]  Oh, it says bomb!
[00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:02.336]  It even says bomb!
[00:31:02.396 --> 00:31:02.797]  Oh no!
[00:31:03.957 --> 00:31:04.597]  It says bomb on it.
[00:31:04.617 --> 00:31:05.958]  Hold on, I'm really scared.
[00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.699]  Oh, George Soros is on it!
[00:31:07.979 --> 00:31:08.940]  Uh, mine's ticking.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.900]  Yours is ticking as well?
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.540]  It's ticking.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.441]  This one says bomb.
[00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:11.981]  What does that mean?
[00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:17.504]  Well, I got this box here and it's from Debbie Wasserman Schultz from Fraud Florida.
[00:31:17.644 --> 00:31:19.145]  Oh, it's another bomb.
[00:31:19.605 --> 00:31:21.026]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz sent you a bomb.
[00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:22.026]  She's got her face on it.
[00:31:22.426 --> 00:31:23.207]  She looks a little cross-eyed.
[00:31:23.227 --> 00:31:24.628]  Hold on, we got a broadcast from the road.
[00:31:24.648 --> 00:31:25.628]  Everybody get out of the office!
[00:31:26.128 --> 00:31:27.209]  Everybody get out of the office!
[00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:30.952]  Oh my God, it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz, cross-eyed.
[00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:31.832]  Well, that's definitely her.
[00:31:31.932 --> 00:31:32.953]  That's a real picture of her.
[00:31:33.073 --> 00:31:34.654]  So that's left-wing, folks.
[00:31:34.714 --> 00:31:38.975]  This is the rhetoric of Soros and Schultz and Hillary, you know, saying we're all evil and fake news.
[00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:44.718]  This caused someone who's their supporter to send us these bombs that are set to detonate.
[00:31:45.018 --> 00:31:47.339]  This one's set to detonate at 5.10 today.
[00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:49.820]  This one's set to detonate in about 30 seconds.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.860]  This one's set, this just says bomb.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.081]  These are clear bombs.
[00:31:53.541 --> 00:31:54.882]  I mean, just look at this.
[00:31:54.922 --> 00:31:56.743]  High, high circuitry here.
[00:31:56.943 --> 00:31:57.984]  Very complex.
[00:31:58.104 --> 00:32:04.388]  I mean, this is not the work of an... It'll take weeks until after the election to figure out what Democrats sent us this, but we've got clues here.
[00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:07.250]  But this has been satire before they said we put out a fake bomb hoax.
[00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.092]  No, it's the Democrats that have been caught that did that.
[00:32:10.712 --> 00:32:19.398]  And they're the ones, and we're just illustrating how anybody could just deliver crap like this and then say it's real, but all the experts say it's not, and they're still breathlessly doing this.
[00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:20.779]  This is their false flag.
[00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:21.640]  This is ridiculous.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.500]  Oh, these aren't real?
[00:32:22.821 --> 00:32:23.361]  These aren't real?
[00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:24.561]  No, no.
[00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:25.602]  No, this is a bombing.
[00:32:26.022 --> 00:32:27.662]  Didn't you see CNN?
[00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:29.563]  Exactly, a bombing happened.
[00:32:29.743 --> 00:32:30.403]  This is a bombing.
[00:32:31.223 --> 00:32:36.185]  And why don't we, we should be like Jayco on CNN when he said he was in the Gulf War getting bombed.
[00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:37.025]  He wasn't.
[00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:38.305]  Or the babies in incubators.
[00:32:38.405 --> 00:32:40.386]  Boom!
[00:32:41.186 --> 00:32:45.447]  It's a bombing!
[00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:47.008]  It's a real bomb!
[00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:47.648]  Get down!
[00:32:55.845 --> 00:33:10.410]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.191 --> 00:33:16.392]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:16.872 --> 00:33:19.353]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:19.853 --> 00:33:22.214]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.188 --> 00:33:29.092]  He gets attacked, he gets lied about, he gets targeted, he gets sued, he gets arrested.
[00:33:29.112 --> 00:33:32.615]  It always falls to pieces because he's so effective.
[00:33:33.395 --> 00:33:35.938]  He's James O'Keefe and the heroes at Project Veritas.
[00:33:36.278 --> 00:33:37.499]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.323]  And he joins us to talk about one of the biggest
[00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.447]  Blockbuster bombshells I've ever seen.
[00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:48.649]  It's posted on InfoWars.com in a big Zero Hedge article.
[00:33:49.369 --> 00:33:50.490]  It's at Veritas.com.
[00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.032]  You've got to get it out to everybody.
[00:33:53.472 --> 00:34:04.600]  Separately, our reporting from a UN press release, bizarrely enough, at NewsWars.com and EuropeWars, shows the UN and Visa giving them prepaid credit cards.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.341]  So it's confirmed.
[00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:06.221]  And the UN's funding it.
[00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:06.782]  That's admitted.
[00:34:07.642 --> 00:34:21.230]  But here's James O'Keefe showing that the main invasion point is going to be McAllen, Texas, where Obama used to have the buses come in by the dozens every few hours and bring in whole families, whole groups of individuals.
[00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:25.293]  The Washington Post reported many end up being put into sex smuggling.
[00:34:26.153 --> 00:34:27.474]  And Trump says, no, we have a border.
[00:34:27.514 --> 00:34:28.395]  We checked, we'll come across.
[00:34:28.615 --> 00:34:32.938]  So here's this rampaging mob coming up and they undercover inside
[00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:44.206]  The Beto O'Rourke campaign have found devastating information that absolutely must sink O'Rourke.
[00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:48.128]  And if it goes all the way to the top, which of course we know it does, he really should be indicted and arrested.
[00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.450]  This isn't just violating campaign finance law.
[00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.372]  This is literally being a Benedict Arnold.
[00:34:53.632 --> 00:34:54.693]  Thank you for joining us, James.
[00:34:54.713 --> 00:34:55.813]  You've only got eight minutes.
[00:34:55.833 --> 00:34:56.494]  You've got the floor.
[00:34:56.734 --> 00:34:57.434]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:34:58.755 --> 00:35:02.738]  This is a pretty amazing video, and you know we've been releasing videos
[00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:05.228]  The last two weeks on different races.
[00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:10.355]  Yesterday in Florida, Gillum fired his staffer for saying Florida's a cracker state.
[00:35:10.395 --> 00:35:14.761]  So when they say that our videos are fake, well, they fire the people that we featured in the video.
[00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.484]  I'm not the source of this information.
[00:35:16.905 --> 00:35:18.587]  They are the source of this information.
[00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:19.749]  So in Texas,
[00:35:20.433 --> 00:35:21.533]  This is last night.
[00:35:22.033 --> 00:35:32.895]  We just confirmed yesterday morning, I'm actually in El Paso right now, we just confirmed this Jody Casey is the campaign manager for Beto O'Rourke.
[00:35:32.915 --> 00:35:36.456]  It's a hundred million dollar operation now because they raised all this money.
[00:35:36.896 --> 00:35:44.817]  She told our undercover reporter not to worry about using campaign funds to pay for the illegal migrant.
[00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:47.598]  This after her staff was on tape.
[00:35:48.178 --> 00:35:57.581]  Saying that they have to lie, mask, break the law in violation of campaign finance law to use the funds to pay for the migrants.
[00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:01.262]  So we have the campaign manager on tape saying, don't worry about doing it.
[00:36:01.602 --> 00:36:05.223]  And we have the staffers on tape doing it and talking about doing it.
[00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.864]  This is not my proposition.
[00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:08.504]  I did not date them.
[00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:11.745]  They volunteered this information to us.
[00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:14.483]  When they did not know they were being recorded, Alex.
[00:36:14.563 --> 00:36:24.331]  So now I went to confront the campaign manager, Jody, Casey is her name, and she gave me no comment when I took my camera out and asked her about the videos.
[00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:25.952]  Did the videos become a phenomenon?
[00:36:26.933 --> 00:36:31.797]  The videos have become a phenomenon and they're viral right now, but we're looking for responses from Beto.
[00:36:32.538 --> 00:36:33.318]  This is incredible.
[00:36:33.939 --> 00:36:37.142]  I need every person in America, not just every Texan, listening.
[00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:43.551]  To go to InfoWars.com and get the Zero Hedge article, because I think it's one of the best and has it all laid out.
[00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:47.252]  Go to ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:48.952]  Go to ZeroHedge.com.
[00:36:48.992 --> 00:36:49.792]  I don't care where you go.
[00:36:49.972 --> 00:36:55.953]  Go get the articles and email them, text message them to 50 people.
[00:36:56.193 --> 00:37:00.374]  You want to beat these folks in a war to destroy our country, that's what it is.
[00:37:00.394 --> 00:37:01.254]  The UN is running this.
[00:37:01.514 --> 00:37:03.655]  Soros is running this to break down Europe, to break down the US.
[00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:04.855]  It's their admitted plan.
[00:37:05.635 --> 00:37:19.692]  When they've got this socialist globalist married to a billion dollar lady, always these rich limousine liberals trying to destroy our country, trying to bring in these criminals, it's up to everyone to get these videos out.
[00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:27.067]  But again, as you just said, James O'Keefe, trying to get Beto O'Rourke to respond, our listeners shouldn't wait.
[00:37:27.748 --> 00:37:29.728]  Don't wait for InfoWars or Veritas to do it.
[00:37:29.768 --> 00:37:36.231]  You must all go to his campaign stops, wherever you are, with a camera, with your cell phone, and bring this up to this monster.
[00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:42.493]  Everyone must go peacefully confront this Benedict Arnold, because we know these orders are coming from the top.
[00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:50.464]  Alex, one of the people, one of the readers, probably one of your readers, actually called up the El Paso newspaper this morning.
[00:37:50.964 --> 00:37:58.866]  And because they made the phone call to the local paper in El Paso, the El Paso media is now assigning a reporter to the story.
[00:37:58.906 --> 00:38:07.929]  So the only way that we're going to really get accountability, and this is a violation of campaign finance law, this is a very big deal, what they're on tape saying and doing here.
[00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:22.458]  They're relying on forms, on federal forms, using prepaid cards, their word, not mine, they're calling them prepaid debit cards, cash disbursements to pay for the migrant caravan people.
[00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:23.758]  This is against the law.
[00:38:23.778 --> 00:38:28.940]  So you guys calling up the local media in Texas and saying, have you guys seen this?
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.660]  You guys covering this?
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:38.443]  That can make a huge difference because the only way Beto is going to be forced to respond is if his friends at the Texas Tribune and others are asking him tough questions.
[00:38:38.936 --> 00:38:39.256]  That's right.
[00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:40.896]  And let's be absolutely clear here.
[00:38:41.137 --> 00:38:42.717]  You've got your lawyers that check all this.
[00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:45.498]  It clearly violates campaign finance law.
[00:38:45.918 --> 00:38:47.798]  He's saying, hey, it's coming from the head campaign person.
[00:38:47.838 --> 00:38:48.398]  It's OK.
[00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:50.739]  They're falsifying forms.
[00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:56.700]  And then they're giving money to people that have traversed our border illegally and other borders illegally.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.962]  And they are aiding and abetting groups that have been caught smuggling children, human trafficking.
[00:39:02.222 --> 00:39:03.962]  So this is illegal on so many fronts.
[00:39:03.982 --> 00:39:07.543]  And then if you've got Beto and his campaign being advised by Brennan
[00:39:08.483 --> 00:39:14.886]  And this is the Democratic Party literally coordinating to flood our borders and create a civil emergency.
[00:39:15.927 --> 00:39:18.108]  Yeah, they've raised so much money.
[00:39:18.128 --> 00:39:20.069]  I don't even know what the number is now.
[00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:23.230]  I'm guessing it's at least $80, if not $100 million.
[00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.091]  No, you're right.
[00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:25.231]  It was $87 million two days ago.
[00:39:25.251 --> 00:39:26.512]  They now estimate it's over $100 million.
[00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:29.650]  So it's a hundred million dollars that they've raised.
[00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.511]  And just so everyone knows who Jody Miller is, she talks to Beto every day.
[00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:34.991]  She is the campaign manager.
[00:39:35.031 --> 00:39:36.032]  I'm a field organizer.
[00:39:36.412 --> 00:39:39.493]  The other two people we have on tape are field organizers.
[00:39:39.813 --> 00:39:44.074]  These are the troops of a campaign that administer day-to-day activities.
[00:39:44.214 --> 00:39:46.955]  Jody actually manages the entire operation.
[00:39:47.015 --> 00:39:48.375]  She runs the whole campaign.
[00:39:48.755 --> 00:39:50.556]  And the fact that she's in the video,
[00:39:51.657 --> 00:39:53.638]  Don't worry that this is happening.
[00:39:53.658 --> 00:40:02.766]  The fact that the field organizers, Dominique and this woman named Reyes, are on tape saying that there are text messages that prove Jody knows about it.
[00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:05.468]  This is a big deal.
[00:40:05.508 --> 00:40:08.751]  This may be the biggest thing we've ever done and don't take my word for it.
[00:40:09.111 --> 00:40:11.233]  I've had Dinesh D'Souza text me today.
[00:40:11.293 --> 00:40:12.834]  I've had Dana Lash text me.
[00:40:12.854 --> 00:40:14.996]  I've had all these people texting me saying this is
[00:40:15.623 --> 00:40:29.250]  It's such a big story, and I hope that all this comes out in a couple days before the election, but it requires all of you listening right now, share this video to everyone that you know.
[00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.231]  It's the only way that we're going to get accountability.
[00:40:33.084 --> 00:40:39.850]  And I cannot stress to people enough, the UN came up with a plan 20 plus years ago with Peter Sutherland, who died this year.
[00:40:40.611 --> 00:40:47.336]  It's all, they wrote books about it, to build these migrant bases, to build these leftist refugee camps where they brainwash them for sometimes up to a year.
[00:40:47.817 --> 00:40:56.484]  Then they bring them into your country, leftist groups get them, go sign them up for welfare, anchor babies, and the Democrats extract part of the money off of them to build an infrastructure
[00:40:57.285 --> 00:41:06.092]  Out of our welfare state, and then they go to totally implode the borders as France's internal minister just said, France is on the verge of collapse.
[00:41:06.452 --> 00:41:08.554]  Thousands of fires a night, murders, deaths.
[00:41:08.874 --> 00:41:20.003]  This is 21st century warfare being directed by multinationals and what you and your crew have done is give us the total proof and the victory, but now everyone must move the ball down the field
[00:41:21.247 --> 00:41:22.329]  Real fast and then we have left.
[00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:23.991]  Please give us updates over the weekend.
[00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:26.795]  Monday I'm going to be doing seven days a week live here, obviously the next four days.
[00:41:27.976 --> 00:41:29.358]  I will Alex.
[00:41:29.378 --> 00:41:31.261]  The truth is manifestly damning.
[00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:32.342]  The truth is not mine.
[00:41:32.382 --> 00:41:33.404]  I'm not the source of this.
[00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:34.745]  We'll keep this credit.
[00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:37.608]  I didn't selectively edit anything.
[00:41:37.668 --> 00:41:39.250]  I put my credibility on the line on this.
[00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:40.451]  I've got 12 lawyers.
[00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:41.852]  I will go under oath.
[00:41:42.332 --> 00:41:44.053]  These recordings are real.
[00:41:44.174 --> 00:41:45.174]  It's not my words.
[00:41:45.355 --> 00:41:46.856]  You can see the list moving.
[00:41:46.896 --> 00:41:48.177]  They always change the subject.
[00:41:48.217 --> 00:41:49.758]  You destroyed Akron.
[00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:51.299]  You've devastated all their operations.
[00:41:51.319 --> 00:41:52.100]  You exposed Hillary.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.664]  You have taken us over the line to win and so have the audience.
[00:41:56.784 --> 00:41:58.045]  All of us together are on a team.
[00:41:58.505 --> 00:42:00.667]  Other big bombshells coming in the next four days, James?
[00:42:01.527 --> 00:42:03.128]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:42:03.168 --> 00:42:07.071]  Let's let this one play out today and see if we can get some comments from Beto.
[00:42:07.672 --> 00:42:08.873]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:12.415]  Again, projectveritasaction.com.
[00:42:12.515 --> 00:42:14.917]  Visit projectveritasaction.com.
[00:42:15.277 --> 00:42:18.680]  Folks, InfoWarsArmy, everybody, peacefully in information warfare.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.081]  Infiltrate these groups.
[00:42:20.141 --> 00:42:21.142]  Come back over the weekend.
[00:42:21.182 --> 00:42:27.487]  I want to hear about how you guys have infiltrated this Democrat CIA operation with your own spy and how they're crapping their britches.
[00:42:29.864 --> 00:42:32.585]  James O'Keefe, ladies and gentlemen, I am so excited right now.
[00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:37.287]  When we come back, we'll go over more of the video that he's talking about and what's happening.
[00:42:37.547 --> 00:42:41.829]  The articles are on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:42:42.369 --> 00:42:42.709]  Get them.
[00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:43.770]  Get them out.
[00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.170]  Nobody needs to know.
[00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.972]  Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies.
[00:42:48.412 --> 00:42:49.432]  Caravan aliens.
[00:42:49.512 --> 00:42:50.753]  Of course, that's what they're doing.
[00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:58.216]  An energized quantum state.
[00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:02.099]  Or an energized atomic state.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.580]  What does that mean?
[00:43:04.662 --> 00:43:05.963]  It means it's pure.
[00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:14.092]  And it means the properties of what it does in the body, in interaction with other properties, is pure.
[00:43:14.973 --> 00:43:16.515]  Is unadulterated.
[00:43:16.595 --> 00:43:17.195]  Is original.
[00:43:17.415 --> 00:43:18.597]  Is first generation.
[00:43:20.154 --> 00:43:31.222]  This has been quite a quest for InfoWars when we discovered that there's a whole UN world government plan to remove even crappy forms of iodine out of food so that people can't absorb it.
[00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:36.986]  When I say crappy forms, I mean types that are bound to other elements so your body doesn't get absorption.
[00:43:37.787 --> 00:43:43.471]  This is an essential element in the body, just like vitamin C, just like oxygen, just like water.
[00:43:44.634 --> 00:43:58.237]  At first, doing research, we got the best seaweed base that was still weak, and we had issues with supply, and then leftists found out six years ago that we were involved, that it was Infowars, so they cut us off.
[00:43:58.997 --> 00:44:07.098]  And then we came into X2 that was from oil and gas drilling at about 7,000 to 12,000 feet, getting pure crystals for truly pure iodine.
[00:44:07.218 --> 00:44:09.879]  We had to go through the DEA to get it, and all these controls.
[00:44:11.075 --> 00:44:15.545]  Then the oil companies caught on that we were getting it, and they tried to jack up prices and cause us problems.
[00:44:15.585 --> 00:44:18.792]  And I didn't want to raise prices, so I cut my contract off of them.
[00:44:19.973 --> 00:44:27.457]  And we went out and did a huge industry research and found out we could get the same deep-earth crystals, probably even purer.
[00:44:27.497 --> 00:44:29.978]  You're talking about like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, you know, percent purer.
[00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:38.502]  And then the chemists and others explained to us that you need other types of basic iodine to make sure it gets fully absorbed.
[00:44:38.562 --> 00:44:40.764]  So this has all three types of iodine.
[00:44:42.208 --> 00:44:51.738]  And then it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that doesn't let it oxidize and basically keeps it in its energetic state, or its quantum state, its atomic state.
[00:44:51.978 --> 00:44:58.505]  Again, atomic doesn't mean radioactive, that just means it's pure on the periodic table.
[00:44:58.585 --> 00:44:59.405]  This is X3.
[00:44:59.966 --> 00:45:01.387]  I am so excited about X3.
[00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:08.595]  That out of the gauge we're bringing it to you at 50% off in the 1 ounce and the 2 ounce bottles.
[00:45:08.615 --> 00:45:10.835]  Now we didn't have X2 in the 2 ounce bottle.
[00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:13.396]  We do for X3 so you can stock up on it.
[00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:18.077]  It really is beyond game changing.
[00:45:18.177 --> 00:45:19.857]  It's essential.
[00:45:21.017 --> 00:45:27.178]  Survival Shield X3, nascent tri-iodine in 2 ounce and in 1 ounce bottles.
[00:45:27.678 --> 00:45:32.359]  And you don't just get a key element that's essential to human life on this planet.
[00:45:33.677 --> 00:45:38.200]  You also fund an operation that's promoting the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the whole nine yards.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:51.648]  I mean, quite frankly, I've got all these scientific documents and all these notes from chemists and all these facts, but I'm just going to tell the viewers, just like our information has changed the world, just like it pisses the establishment off, anything I'm going to bring you is the very best.
[00:45:52.288 --> 00:45:53.329]  It's like any of our products.
[00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.090]  I'm like, what is the top product?
[00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.151]  What is the best tested?
[00:45:56.471 --> 00:45:57.752]  What is absolutely highest rated?
[00:45:58.272 --> 00:46:02.335]  I want to put a formula out stronger and better and lower the price.
[00:46:03.035 --> 00:46:04.116]  We're always innovating.
[00:46:04.156 --> 00:46:05.177]  We're always researching.
[00:46:05.818 --> 00:46:16.108]  But quite frankly, it's been oppression and it's the people trying to block our supply chain that made us go out and really do the hard work to discover what is the very best documented form of iodine.
[00:46:16.768 --> 00:46:22.434]  And it's all three types fused together, energized by a small amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it.
[00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:26.861]  Three forms of iodine is better than one.
[00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:29.982]  And so that's why X3 is so amazing.
[00:46:30.502 --> 00:46:37.666]  That's why all the results we've got and the trials we have with the crew and others are so breathtakingly cool.
[00:46:37.766 --> 00:46:43.868]  If you like X2, you're going to love X3 and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:44.189 --> 00:46:44.789]  The next level.
[00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:59.262]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.247 --> 00:47:15.528]  You found it.
[00:47:15.548 --> 00:47:18.149]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.311]  It's the Infowar.
[00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:24.633]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:24.993 --> 00:47:30.977]  This is not a spectator sport.
[00:47:32.097 --> 00:47:36.940]  The entire Democratic Party works for multinational tax-exempt foundations.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.163]  They created the UN to transfer national power into their own coffers.
[00:47:42.045 --> 00:47:44.187]  They have organized the collapse of the third world.
[00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:45.788]  They have weaponized them.
[00:47:45.808 --> 00:47:48.611]  They have taught the third world to hate America.
[00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:51.193]  They have taught them to hate white people.
[00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:53.415]  Now most of them don't down in those countries.
[00:47:53.455 --> 00:47:54.516]  They see through the communists.
[00:47:54.836 --> 00:48:04.125]  But they take the worst of the communists, the worst of the dumbed down, they organize them, they train them, and they fund them each step of the way so they don't take the big paycheck and run off.
[00:48:04.977 --> 00:48:09.339]  They get paid up to $1,000 per leg.
[00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.479]  This is all public U.N.
[00:48:11.559 --> 00:48:12.120]  operations.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.222]  And now you see the next leg funded by the U.N.
[00:48:18.982 --> 00:48:31.347]  and funded by MasterCard, mainstream news, press release from the U.N., at the Texas leg in McAllen and in El Paso.
[00:48:33.456 --> 00:48:36.758]  This is a civil war inside of our country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:55.169]  And then, they play dumb, and if you mention George Soros is involved, his Open Society Foundation, he gets taxpayer money through the UN, then he has his little criminal NGO do it, they call you an anti-Semite, then Louie Gohmert had to go on Lou Dobbs' Let's Not and say it's not racist?
[00:48:56.448 --> 00:48:57.910]  To say that George Soros is funding it?
[00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.032]  No, it's not racist to say that the sky is blue.
[00:49:00.573 --> 00:49:03.576]  But that's the level of how dumb they think you are.
[00:49:03.596 --> 00:49:08.962]  And it all rests on you not knowing that these are giant invasion forces.
[00:49:09.563 --> 00:49:12.646]  In the last six years, they've brought 15 million.
[00:49:16.997 --> 00:49:26.621]  Military-age men out of North Africa and out of the Middle East, the worst of the worst of those countries, and the burning and the raping and the killing is unbelievable.
[00:49:27.622 --> 00:49:31.864]  The Interior Minister of France said yesterday, we are collapsing.
[00:49:32.644 --> 00:49:36.285]  We must start now to reverse this or we will not have a civilization.
[00:49:36.826 --> 00:49:39.407]  Within five years, we will be a failed state.
[00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:50.854]  Yes, if you import a failed state into your country, and the left teaches them to hate you, it's called 21st century warfare.
[00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:57.015]  Listen to Shan, there's not rhetoric strong enough to say what's going on.
[00:49:57.835 --> 00:49:58.916]  How would you take down America?
[00:49:58.956 --> 00:49:59.796]  Not with nuclear weapons.
[00:50:00.316 --> 00:50:01.016]  You'd kill yourself.
[00:50:01.456 --> 00:50:02.017]  You wouldn't take it?
[00:50:02.077 --> 00:50:02.997]  No, you want to capture it.
[00:50:03.677 --> 00:50:06.678]  So you bring the third world you've already enslaved in,
[00:50:07.793 --> 00:50:10.435]  And you have Michael Moore say white people are inherently bad?
[00:50:10.715 --> 00:50:12.176]  You have Don Lemon say they're inherently bad?
[00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:20.462]  Even the UN admits persecution of Christians doubled about 10 years ago.
[00:50:20.542 --> 00:50:22.023]  It doubled again in the last few years.
[00:50:22.684 --> 00:50:26.066]  And the Islamicists are killing millions of their own people a year.
[00:50:26.407 --> 00:50:33.372]  But Don Lemon says that white males are the most violent group in the world and shows some fake pie charts.
[00:50:40.293 --> 00:50:44.574]  No, the least violent group in the world are Japanese people.
[00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:47.495]  And then you go down the line from there.
[00:50:50.816 --> 00:50:56.838]  Whites are like number three in the world under groups on average for lowest crime rate.
[00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:58.019]  That's a fact, everybody knows it.
[00:50:58.959 --> 00:51:07.402]  But again, the idea that we're all guilty and we're bad, so then everyone has to come in and then these weird, big, fat, neurotic white people
[00:51:09.207 --> 00:51:14.689]  Sit there and look at the demographic numbers and say, we'll just turn them all into racists, and then they'll come after everybody.
[00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:25.293]  So what headline do I come up with, with James O'Keefe pleading with you to get the videos at InfoWars.com out to everybody?
[00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:36.218]  I'm gonna take that video, I'm gonna put it out, and I'm gonna say, Beto O'Rourke caught generaling, quarterbacking, the US invasion leg,
[00:51:38.544 --> 00:51:42.767]  Democrats on the border, planning to fight U.S.
[00:51:42.827 --> 00:51:47.591]  military and border patrol and aid armed invaders, and Beto's at the center of it!
[00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:48.271]  Really?
[00:51:48.331 --> 00:51:48.852]  No kidding?
[00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.113]  A leftist globalist?
[00:51:53.535 --> 00:51:54.916]  With Brennan as his advisor?
[00:51:56.738 --> 00:51:57.238]  Of course!
[00:51:58.419 --> 00:52:07.746]  You don't just think the Democrats now hoard, it is now over a hundred million, a hundred million, the most expensive Senate campaign ever, outspending Ted Cruz three to one,
[00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:12.206]  You don't just think that money accidentally got sent down here.
[00:52:12.366 --> 00:52:15.167]  It's all coming out of multinationals.
[00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:17.248]  It's out of China's subsidiaries.
[00:52:17.668 --> 00:52:19.008]  It's all illegal.
[00:52:19.228 --> 00:52:21.089]  And no one ever prosecutes the Democrats.
[00:52:22.149 --> 00:52:24.270]  They commit whatever crimes they want.
[00:52:28.492 --> 00:52:29.712]  I am speechless at this point.
[00:52:30.292 --> 00:52:32.993]  We've got hours and hours of video up on Infowars.com.
[00:52:33.213 --> 00:52:37.675]  But what do I call that last segment of James O'Keefe begging you?
[00:52:39.229 --> 00:52:39.869]  To take action.
[00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.870]  And I know you've been taking action.
[00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:45.833]  But you've got to hammer your entire phone list.
[00:52:46.533 --> 00:52:57.139]  There's ways to get into your phones, depending on what type it is, and you can put an InfoWars.com link to Beto Bombshell's new viral video show, Staffers Use Campaign Funds to Illegally Aid Migrant Caravans.
[00:52:57.179 --> 00:52:57.559]  Of course!
[00:52:57.779 --> 00:52:59.400]  They've been funding it every step of the way!
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:00.721]  U.S.
[00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:03.082]  money has from the Democrats that they stole from taxpayers.
[00:53:05.885 --> 00:53:07.065]  How do you describe that?
[00:53:07.105 --> 00:53:08.126]  How do you deal with that?
[00:53:08.246 --> 00:53:11.967]  They just have the mainstream media up there going, Trump's an evil man.
[00:53:11.987 --> 00:53:13.927]  He's going to hurt the little children they're trying to come up.
[00:53:13.967 --> 00:53:16.808]  Meanwhile, show the footage of them throwing rocks at U.S.
[00:53:16.828 --> 00:53:17.468]  helicopters.
[00:53:19.189 --> 00:53:22.750]  And Trump, the dramatic footage, we even got to that last night in the speech, very powerful.
[00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.011]  He said, yeah, if you throw rocks at the military, we're going to shoot you.
[00:53:28.191 --> 00:53:30.033]  And what that is, is not a call for violence.
[00:53:30.573 --> 00:53:34.658]  He's telling these mainly military-age men, a lot of them on video, saying, yeah, I can't wait.
[00:53:34.958 --> 00:53:35.539]  I got deported.
[00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:36.199]  I'm going back to the U.S.
[00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:36.980]  to kill more cops.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:37.781]  That's a quote.
[00:53:38.956 --> 00:53:44.220]  He's telling these military-aged men, you will be treated as military operatives.
[00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:45.341]  Let's play that clip in a moment.
[00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:46.002]  Let's play that first.
[00:53:46.642 --> 00:53:57.291]  You will be treated, you're a bunch of tough guys, you ran through the police, you ran through the military, you've shown you're in a man's world, you hold up kids in front of you while you do it.
[00:53:57.491 --> 00:54:00.954]  We've seen that with the Palestinians and the Islamicists, you little dirtbags.
[00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:05.687]  And so you do that up front, we're putting you on notice.
[00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:09.372]  That's called a shot across the bow.
[00:54:10.193 --> 00:54:11.595]  That's a warning.
[00:54:12.056 --> 00:54:12.977]  The first one's free.
[00:54:13.498 --> 00:54:14.920]  You better be glad we're giving it to you.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:32.683]  And I'm telling you, it's time for these out-of-control criminals like Brennan and O'Rourke, and all these people trying to destroy our country, and trying to bring in a third-world population they control and they suck off of as a permanent underclass, to know that they are going to be brought to justice.
[00:54:32.963 --> 00:54:36.764]  And Trump has put out an image saying, after the election, sanctions.
[00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:38.444]  It isn't just a message to Iran.
[00:54:41.225 --> 00:54:42.525]  It isn't just a message to Iran.
[00:54:46.949 --> 00:54:48.390]  It's a message to all you criminals.
[00:54:49.732 --> 00:54:54.476]  That you have pushed so far, you people are so crazy, and it's our fault for not putting you in your place.
[00:54:55.357 --> 00:54:56.538]  Sanctions are coming.
[00:54:59.702 --> 00:55:00.442]  November 6th.
[00:55:02.044 --> 00:55:02.524]  Get ready.
[00:55:05.007 --> 00:55:05.147]  Now.
[00:55:07.481 --> 00:55:10.462]  Isn't Trump a bad man for standing up for our country in its darkest hour?
[00:55:10.922 --> 00:55:13.323]  We should just collapse into Venezuela and let the U.N.
[00:55:13.383 --> 00:55:13.683]  run us.
[00:55:14.404 --> 00:55:15.624]  We don't need a civilization.
[00:55:15.684 --> 00:55:17.245]  Only elites behind big armored walls.
[00:55:17.545 --> 00:55:19.726]  How dare Trump be so bad?
[00:55:20.026 --> 00:55:21.226]  Hollywood cares about us.
[00:55:21.746 --> 00:55:23.147]  The Rockefellers care about us.
[00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:24.507]  The Chi-Coms care about us.
[00:55:27.969 --> 00:55:29.229]  Trump's standing up for this country.
[00:55:29.729 --> 00:55:31.370]  This country's been totally sold out by traitors.
[00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:34.071]  It's like Ulysses coming home after being gone for 30 years.
[00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.552]  You traitors are in big trouble.
[00:55:37.523 --> 00:55:38.403]  So read your Iliad.
[00:55:39.144 --> 00:55:45.686]  Let's go to the President talking about we'll fire on those trying to kill people with rocks, just like they do in the Middle East.
[00:55:45.706 --> 00:55:45.986]  Here it is.
[00:55:46.506 --> 00:55:58.249]  But I will tell you this, anybody throwing stones, rocks, like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico, we will consider that a firearm.
[00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.011]  Because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.
[00:56:04.554 --> 00:56:08.457]  Which, as you know, it was very violent a few days ago.
[00:56:08.517 --> 00:56:09.478]  Very, very violent.
[00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:13.201]  That break-in, it was a break-in of a country.
[00:56:13.421 --> 00:56:14.622]  They broke into Mexico.
[00:56:16.143 --> 00:56:22.288]  And you look at what's happening in Guatemala, just to mention Guatemala along with El Salvador and Honduras.
[00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:25.971]  It's disgraceful that those countries aren't able to stop this.
[00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:28.433]  Because they should be able to stop it before it starts.
[00:56:29.434 --> 00:56:33.036]  We're seeing civilization level collapse.
[00:56:34.025 --> 00:56:37.726]  And our president is on fire to defend this republic.
[00:56:37.946 --> 00:56:38.826]  He loves the mission.
[00:56:40.126 --> 00:56:46.948]  And we've barely gotten a few hundred troops in place so far, and the left is filing suits trying to stop them, saying we have no right to a border!
[00:56:46.968 --> 00:56:56.390]  And there come the people that eat your pension fines, and to be used up by the system and used by permanent underclass by the left who want slaves.
[00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:03.956]  They're all fleeing Venezuelan communism, and they're coming here waving their foreign flags, and we're going to do that again here.
[00:57:05.397 --> 00:57:06.859]  Please don't forget we're Lister-supported.
[00:57:06.879 --> 00:57:09.862]  When you get t-shirts, books, films, it makes what we do here possible.
[00:57:10.959 --> 00:57:13.441]  And please don't forget we have the very best supplements out there.
[00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:23.166]  We have developed an even better iodine with the Deep Earth Crystal Source and two other types and a tiny bit of vitamin C that keeps it from oxidizing to be even better than X2.
[00:57:23.526 --> 00:57:27.108]  It's ultimate iodine, 50% off, out of the gates and free shipping.
[00:57:27.128 --> 00:57:28.609]  I want you to see how amazing it is.
[00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:32.972]  X3 Survival Shield exclusively at InfoWarsLives.com.
[00:57:32.992 --> 00:57:33.032]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:33.052 --> 00:57:34.292]  Whatever you do.
[00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:42.880]  Share the live video stream at Infowars.com.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:43.761]  Three words.
[00:57:44.782 --> 00:57:46.464]  Energized quantum state.
[00:57:48.025 --> 00:57:48.546]  Two words.
[00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:50.287]  X3.
[00:57:51.769 --> 00:57:56.093]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[00:57:56.553 --> 00:57:57.414]  That's for good reasons.
[00:57:58.295 --> 00:57:59.476]  We've done our research.
[00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.378]  We've seen how they're targeting the people.
[00:58:03.524 --> 00:58:03.784]  I don't know.
[00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:30.884]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[00:58:31.444 --> 00:58:35.346]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[00:58:35.847 --> 00:58:36.067]  Folks,
[00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.692]  Everything we do makes the Globals pull their hair out for a reason.
[00:58:40.913 --> 00:58:43.955]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[00:58:44.135 --> 00:58:46.477]  They are completely into iodine.
[00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:48.899]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.583]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[00:58:53.603 --> 00:58:55.645]  X1, X2 are great.
[00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.840]  X3 is the next level.
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.582]  It has the Deep Earth Crystals, the other two types, and a little bit of Vitamin C to energize it.
[00:59:02.983 --> 00:59:06.545]  It's available in 2-ounce and 1-ounce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:06.725 --> 00:59:13.829]  And from the very start, 50% off and free shipping because I want you to get it, and I want you to take it, and I want you to see what it does.
[00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:18.652]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, X3.
[00:59:19.152 --> 00:59:20.233]  Now again, it's an element.
[00:59:20.293 --> 00:59:21.734]  It takes a few weeks to kick in.
[00:59:21.754 --> 00:59:25.016]  A lot of people detoxify about three weeks in.
[00:59:25.076 --> 00:59:25.816]  So be ready for that.
[00:59:25.856 --> 00:59:26.577]  Consult your physician.

[01:00:09.393 --> 01:00:11.194]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.394 --> 01:00:13.355]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:15.977 --> 01:00:19.479]  Jody, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas Action.
[01:00:19.899 --> 01:00:20.340]  How are you?
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:28.085]  Hi, we have your campaign staffers on tape admitting to using campaign money to pay for migrants.
[01:00:28.805 --> 01:00:29.966]  And I just have to ask you,
[01:00:32.276 --> 01:00:34.817]  Well, we already have you on tape.
[01:00:35.618 --> 01:00:37.099]  This is your campaign workers.
[01:00:38.059 --> 01:00:39.620]  I'd like to get your comment, ma'am.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.000]  Thank you.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:40.801]  I said no comment.
[01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:43.542]  Well, this video is about to go public.
[01:00:43.582 --> 01:00:56.250]  It just made me really concerned, because I know that we're using some of the campaign resources to help with the migrants, and I just didn't want anyone to get in trouble with that.
[01:00:56.330 --> 01:01:00.572]  I didn't want them to ask me any questions about people using resources.
[01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:09.937]  I don't know.
[01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:13.381]  It was a tough kind of question.
[01:01:13.982 --> 01:01:15.423]  They said it was fine.
[01:01:15.484 --> 01:01:16.705]  I need to... Yeah.
[01:01:16.785 --> 01:01:18.947]  I don't want to get there.
[01:01:19.808 --> 01:01:20.289]  I told you.
[01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.050]  Yeah.
[01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.513]  I have the messages to prove it, so...
[01:01:25.706 --> 01:01:27.928]  They're not advertising it.
[01:01:27.948 --> 01:01:31.991]  They're using campaign funds to pay for it.
[01:01:46.724 --> 01:01:48.766]  He said don't worry about using campaign resources.
[01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:50.147]  It's a violation of section 1001.
[01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.089]  It's an FEC violation.
[01:01:52.569 --> 01:01:53.870]  Do you have any comment?
[01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:58.234]  Excuse me, do you have any comment?
[01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:02.778]  Alright guys, we'll see you on the internet.
[01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:09.855]  Well, you just saw Jody, the campaign manager, repeatedly saying she doesn't have a comment.
[01:02:10.315 --> 01:02:12.295]  We have all their people on video.
[01:02:12.836 --> 01:02:13.896]  There's nothing much to say.
[01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:17.457]  The video speaks for itself, and now they'll have to answer for it.
[01:02:18.037 --> 01:02:23.819]  Reporting outside of the Beto campaign headquarters in El Paso, Texas, is James O'Keefe from Project Veritas Action.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.441]  Obama ran the open borders.
[01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:32.042]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:32.422]  Obama
[01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:36.724]  It said, let in whoever can come to the border.
[01:02:37.564 --> 01:02:40.365]  This has been going on for six, seven years.
[01:02:41.185 --> 01:02:42.405]  And now Trump's trying to stop it.
[01:02:43.706 --> 01:02:45.466]  So they act like it's not going on.
[01:02:46.326 --> 01:02:48.086]  Ladies and gentlemen, we come back from break.
[01:02:49.427 --> 01:02:51.087]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:02:51.107 --> 01:02:56.428]  The only other place it is, is at Mastercard's website.
[01:02:57.668 --> 01:03:03.029]  They officially brag that they are working with the UN to fund the migrant invasion
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:09.555]  With $1,000 per league.
[01:03:09.575 --> 01:03:10.316]  $1,000 per leg.
[01:03:12.098 --> 01:03:21.507]  Some of these people have gone up to six legs from Venezuela and are now on the final leg of the Venezuelan invasion force.
[01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:23.149]  They're calling them Hondurans.
[01:03:23.689 --> 01:03:25.271]  That's the last country they smash through.
[01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:27.734]  By the time they get here, they'll call them Mexicans.
[01:03:28.573 --> 01:03:35.079]  Almost all of them are Venezuelans and Hondurans waving their own flags and declaring the destruction of our nation.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.906]  Screaming down with the USA, burning American flags because they're who the UN organized.
[01:03:42.466 --> 01:03:44.188]  So of course, Beto O'Rourke
[01:03:45.427 --> 01:03:50.913]  And his campaign offices are like, to the low levels, is it alright to give him money and all this stuff?
[01:03:51.213 --> 01:03:53.916]  Well, of course it's okay to give him prepaid credit cards.
[01:03:54.717 --> 01:03:56.719]  I talked to the higher-ups, they say it's alright.
[01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.321]  It's meant to be compartmentalized.
[01:03:58.361 --> 01:04:01.884]  Like, does Don Corleone know we're running whorehouses?
[01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:03.626]  No, the Don doesn't know.
[01:04:03.646 --> 01:04:04.547]  Well, then I'm not going to do it.
[01:04:04.727 --> 01:04:05.969]  Well, the Don said it was alright.
[01:04:08.752 --> 01:04:10.574]  It's called compartmentalization, need to know.
[01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:12.455]  It's all right here.
[01:04:12.595 --> 01:04:13.616]  Look at this.
[01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:16.178]  UN MasterCard supplying migrants with prepaid bank cards.
[01:04:16.779 --> 01:04:18.780]  That is europe.infowars.com.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.403]  It's linked up on infowars.com.
[01:04:21.643 --> 01:04:23.885]  But look, people are like, oh yeah, right, Alex Jones.
[01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:25.846]  It's been unearthed.
[01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:27.628]  Look at this.
[01:04:27.848 --> 01:04:28.228]  Unearthed.
[01:04:28.889 --> 01:04:34.293]  Officially, MasterCard and George Soros to explore private sector solutions to societal challenges.
[01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:35.855]  That was in January.
[01:04:37.489 --> 01:04:38.811]  Eleven months ago.
[01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:43.657]  Oh Soros, he's not involved and it says he's directly funding with MasterCard the U.N.
[01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:45.339]  operation with taxpayer money.
[01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:48.142]  And here it is from MasterCard.
[01:04:49.304 --> 01:04:50.826]  From the MasterCard website.
[01:04:53.547 --> 01:05:02.838]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:05:02.878 --> 01:05:05.161]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:11.848]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:18.332]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:05:18.792 --> 01:05:24.395]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:05:25.116 --> 01:05:32.079]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:45.784]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:05:46.304 --> 01:05:50.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:05:50.566 --> 01:05:53.266]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:06:06.224 --> 01:06:08.145]  Coming up, I'm going to open the phones.
[01:06:08.606 --> 01:06:10.267]  In fact, I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:06:10.307 --> 01:06:16.670]  It's the bottom of the hour, and I'm going to go to your calls on these big subjects.
[01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:20.032]  That's right.
[01:06:20.533 --> 01:06:22.434]  We are back live here, four days out.
[01:06:24.155 --> 01:06:27.117]  When you study this, and you know basically every angle of it,
[01:06:28.166 --> 01:06:34.249]  And you turn on the news or you read the New York Times and it says George Soros is not involved with the UN.
[01:06:34.669 --> 01:06:36.810]  George Soros is not involved with open borders.
[01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.271]  George Soros is not involved with the migrant caravan.
[01:06:39.711 --> 01:06:40.612]  No one's funding it.
[01:06:40.672 --> 01:06:41.592]  It's all by itself.
[01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.675]  And then you can pull up Forbes, AP, Reuters, Dallas Morning News.
[01:06:48.635 --> 01:06:54.058]  This year George Soros is going, I'm helping the poor migrants with the UN and we're funding it.
[01:06:55.626 --> 01:07:02.348]  So it's a positive article, they admit he's doing it, but if we say it's wrong or illegal to be doing this human smuggling, they go, we're not doing anything!
[01:07:02.368 --> 01:07:05.388]  In fact, there's not even caravans.
[01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:08.169]  But then Michael Moore told the truth in a twisted way.
[01:07:08.209 --> 01:07:11.310]  He said, these caravans have been going on for many years.
[01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:14.570]  That's right, there's caravans already smashed across.
[01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.171]  The Border Patrol can't stop them.
[01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:18.511]  They're outgunned 100 to 1.
[01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:23.012]  In Beto O'Rourke's so-called town, we're in carpet bags.
[01:07:24.253 --> 01:07:24.973]  In El Paso,
[01:07:26.718 --> 01:07:40.501]  And there's the Project Veritas video on InfoWars.com going viral right now of Beto O'Rourke's campaign people admitting that they're giving them the prepaid credit cards and food and bus tickets and everything else to go to the next destination.
[01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:41.762]  What do they say?
[01:07:41.842 --> 01:07:47.203]  Catholic Charities and other, well we call them churches and then the guy laughs.
[01:07:49.584 --> 01:07:55.645]  The left then manages the groups they bring in, put them in cheap housing and then milk the welfare off of them.
[01:07:57.469 --> 01:08:13.937]  They'll then put them in factories working, owned by Democrats, in towns they control where there's no inspection, and then they don't even give them their paychecks, and they tell them, you don't complain about this or we'll have you shipped back to Venezuela.
[01:08:15.117 --> 01:08:15.998]  This is all on record.
[01:08:16.338 --> 01:08:17.658]  This is how the Democrats work, folks.
[01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:22.161]  They bring in really poor Muslim groups and have them work in factories.
[01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:25.082]  It's always run by a liberal Muslim who's over it.
[01:08:26.016 --> 01:08:28.799]  Very, very, very sick.
[01:08:29.519 --> 01:08:35.545]  These are sick, exploitive, evil people that will destroy what middle class and economy we have.
[01:08:35.585 --> 01:08:36.526]  This is their plan.
[01:08:38.608 --> 01:08:42.631]  And it is mind-boggling that we've gotten to this point.
[01:08:44.293 --> 01:08:47.336]  And you've got the illegal alien invaders, the military, it's men all over.
[01:08:48.524 --> 01:09:08.318]  Burning, and killing, and attacking, and blocking roads, and carjacking, and the French domestic minister, interior minister said yesterday, we have already collapsed in many cities, civilization is gone, the roads aren't working, everything is collapsing, if we don't start now, stopping this, we will collapse completely in five years.
[01:09:09.419 --> 01:09:13.562]  That's... red alert, red alert, red alert!
[01:09:14.843 --> 01:09:16.024]  This is the plan!
[01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:36.778]  The multinationals are collapsing the first world to bring in a new age of total tyranny, where there's a huge group of poor people and a tiny group of owners, and all the big tech heads and all the big elites pay no taxes, and they fund race-based politics everywhere.
[01:09:38.559 --> 01:09:43.142]  And now, hundreds of times worse than I've ever seen,
[01:09:44.284 --> 01:09:48.467]  Every globalist paper is, whites are inherently an evil group.
[01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:58.734]  Whites must be genocided, whites must be removed, whites are the problem, and it's always big, giant, evil, fat demons, like Michael Moore, who are white.
[01:10:00.395 --> 01:10:02.296]  New York Times, should I give up on white people?
[01:10:03.437 --> 01:10:05.238]  White people are the number one terror threat in the world.
[01:10:06.079 --> 01:10:07.840]  White people, I mean, I've got all these clips.
[01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:13.044]  Oprah Winfrey, we need to get rid of, kill all these, all you old white people, they need to just die!
[01:10:15.401 --> 01:10:23.224]  But she's meeting at the most elite UN global secret meetings for world population reduction, and her job is to target Africans.
[01:10:23.264 --> 01:10:24.705]  These are sick people, folks.
[01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:26.046]  They're targeting everybody.
[01:10:27.426 --> 01:10:27.946]  Oh, but look!
[01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:37.751]  Texas Voter Info, Beto O'Rourke gets almost half of his donations from Soros, Act Blue, according to federal documents.
[01:10:40.512 --> 01:10:41.052]  There's another one.
[01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:46.945]  Cash Assistance Empowers Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Greece.
[01:10:49.647 --> 01:10:57.252]  That's officially from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Group that brings in the invaders and brainwashes them.
[01:10:57.372 --> 01:11:00.414]  UN Mastercard Supplying Migrants with Prepaid Bank Cards.
[01:11:00.835 --> 01:11:01.475]  Where did we get this?
[01:11:01.535 --> 01:11:02.436]  At NewsWorks.com?
[01:11:04.497 --> 01:11:06.439]  Or did Dan Lyman with the great work he does get that?
[01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:07.840]  He got it from...
[01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:11.971]  Mainstream news.
[01:11:12.972 --> 01:11:17.855]  Oh, from MasterCard itself in press releases.
[01:11:18.436 --> 01:11:27.182]  MasterCard and George Soros to explore, this was nine months ago, private sector solutions to societal challenges.
[01:11:28.363 --> 01:11:29.004]  Oh, and look.
[01:11:30.267 --> 01:11:30.807]  There it is.
[01:11:30.927 --> 01:11:32.408]  World Refugee Day.
[01:11:32.808 --> 01:11:34.148]  Mastercard.com.
[01:11:34.168 --> 01:11:34.689]  Here, zoom in.
[01:11:35.049 --> 01:11:36.869]  Mastercard.com.
[01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:48.973]  It says they're working all over the world, from North Africa to the Middle East, to Central and South America, North America, on track to support the migrants.
[01:11:49.834 --> 01:11:55.716]  They always show a little girl, not military age men, raping or burning her house down, or burning her car up.
[01:11:56.886 --> 01:11:59.908]  Coming to help you have flexibility and dignity.
[01:12:00.848 --> 01:12:02.349]  They don't want to help in their own third world country.
[01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:02.829]  No, no, no.
[01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.551]  They're gonna bring them here and they're gonna control them.
[01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:11.334]  MasterCard prepaid debt cards provide refugees with mobility, flexibility, and dignity.
[01:12:11.614 --> 01:12:12.274]  And where it's from?
[01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.055]  MasterCard.com.
[01:12:14.095 --> 01:12:15.316]  And guess who they list in here?
[01:12:15.676 --> 01:12:19.678]  George Soros!
[01:12:20.119 --> 01:12:23.520]  Who they say isn't involved in anything.
[01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.442]  No, no, he didn't do anything.
[01:12:29.076 --> 01:12:38.540]  New York Times, Alex Jones must be taken completely off the air for defaming George Soros and saying he's funding open borders.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.681]  Well, that's just insane.
[01:12:39.701 --> 01:12:41.622]  He's only in thousands of interviews saying it for 25, 30 years.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.081]  And of course, Beto.
[01:12:46.022 --> 01:12:46.482]  Beto.
[01:12:46.842 --> 01:12:47.203]  Peto.
[01:12:47.223 --> 01:12:48.263]  Whatever his stupid name is.
[01:12:48.343 --> 01:12:48.884]  Beta male.
[01:12:49.284 --> 01:12:49.785]  Globalist.
[01:12:50.045 --> 01:12:51.506]  He's married to a billionaire heiress.
[01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.087]  He's filthy rich.
[01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:54.468]  His mother's a famous Democrat.
[01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:56.510]  He gets up and says, my mother's a Republican.
[01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.731]  100% pure lies!
[01:12:58.751 --> 01:13:00.353]  But he did tell the truth.
[01:13:00.393 --> 01:13:05.997]  He said, I think we need to ban all of the semi-automatic rifles.
[01:13:08.513 --> 01:13:09.374]  He hates you.
[01:13:10.575 --> 01:13:12.317]  He just lives to destroy Texas.
[01:13:12.857 --> 01:13:14.119]  They hate strength.
[01:13:14.219 --> 01:13:14.979]  They hate honor.
[01:13:15.019 --> 01:13:15.660]  They hate will.
[01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:20.805]  They don't want to bring in migrants and get them into America and make them love America and we love them.
[01:13:21.045 --> 01:13:32.156]  They want to poison them with leftist venom while he gets up to the public and tells them, I'm red, white, and blue.
[01:13:33.848 --> 01:13:36.070]  Sounds like a cross between Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama.
[01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:36.850]  He's a joke.
[01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:38.311]  He's a hit-and-run criminal.
[01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:39.412]  He's a fraud.
[01:13:39.672 --> 01:13:51.060]  He's the enemy of this country, and he's been caught lying on federal forms to take campaign money from all sorts of multinational groups and then give it to human smugglers.
[01:13:53.802 --> 01:13:55.243]  Human smugglers!
[01:13:58.305 --> 01:14:01.447]  We just put up with the Democrats, let them do whatever they want, so why shouldn't they?
[01:14:01.467 --> 01:14:02.448]  They're gonna steal, steal big!
[01:14:04.124 --> 01:14:07.488]  George Soros Mastercard to partner to aid migrants and refugees.
[01:14:07.508 --> 01:14:07.728]  Reuters!
[01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:07.728]  2017!
[01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:11.172]  Almost two years ago.
[01:14:19.226 --> 01:14:21.407]  Right after Trump gets elected, Reuters.
[01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:40.839]  But I tell you this, Trump tells you this, oh that he's funding them with these cards and cash, and we track the groups back that it's him, publicly, it's not even hidden, and they just go, man I tell ya, we gotta do something about the right-wing lie machine, yeah that Lou Dobbs needs to get fired, that Matt Drudge is evil, yeah Trump's crazy, he said that there's a group bringing him in.
[01:14:40.859 --> 01:14:43.701]  That's preposterous!
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:57.024]  Thousands of articles with George Soros bragging that he overthrew the elected government and put Nazis in Ukraine who literally heil Hitler.
[01:15:01.246 --> 01:15:03.827]  How did you feel working to round up the Jews with your godfather?
[01:15:04.287 --> 01:15:05.087]  I felt nothing.
[01:15:05.147 --> 01:15:06.708]  It was happy making time.
[01:15:07.488 --> 01:15:09.089]  Actually, it was the best time of my life.
[01:15:09.109 --> 01:15:10.909]  Do you feel any guilt?
[01:15:11.429 --> 01:15:11.669]  No.
[01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:13.490]  Actually, I feel no guilt.
[01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:15.491]  It's quite nice, actually.
[01:15:16.587 --> 01:15:21.749]  How dare Jones talk about him, the Holocaust survivor, that he helped the Nazis?
[01:15:22.089 --> 01:15:23.850]  There's nothing that Jones won't do!
[01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:28.732]  Oh my gosh!
[01:15:28.752 --> 01:15:32.813]  New York Times yesterday, huge article, the right wing's crazy!
[01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.374]  They think Soros has power!
[01:15:35.734 --> 01:15:39.976]  He gave $32 billion this year to crush America.
[01:15:41.177 --> 01:15:43.497]  Can American red blood and common sense beat $32 billion?
[01:15:45.305 --> 01:15:48.347]  The Republicans aren't even spending a billion on the whole campaign.
[01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:51.329]  They got us outnumbered 30 plus to one.
[01:15:52.891 --> 01:16:05.820]  What I'm about to break down is so simple and so apparent, so prima facie, that I almost don't want to play 2001 Space Odyssey music to build it up.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.300]  You know what?
[01:16:07.241 --> 01:16:09.323]  Simplicity and truth deserves it.
[01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:18.549]  Introducing Survival Shield X3, iodine in an energized quantum state, or an atomic state.
[01:16:18.569 --> 01:16:20.770]  That doesn't mean radioactive, it means elemental.
[01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:32.793]  All three forms, including deep earth crystal iodine, two other forms and a tiny amount of vitamin C, to stop it from oxidizing and keep it in that state of true purity.
[01:16:33.313 --> 01:16:37.994]  So that when it hits your cells, when it goes into your body, it has the amazing effect.
[01:16:39.144 --> 01:16:41.124]  We all need oxygen to live on this planet.
[01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:43.045]  We all need water to live.
[01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:43.745]  We all need food.
[01:16:44.565 --> 01:16:53.087]  But there are other key building blocks, other key elements, that if we don't have them, well, we got a big problem.
[01:16:54.127 --> 01:16:58.808]  And Survival Shield X3 is the next level of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:59.288 --> 01:17:06.210]  And what we've been able to develop and come up with takes the game-changing, trailblazing,
[01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:12.086]  Things that we witnessed with X2, and it takes it to a whole other level.
[01:17:12.287 --> 01:17:23.699]  We have a two ounce bottles, we have a one ounce bottles, and this is the best thing of scientists, chemists, researchers, to come up with a formula that is beyond true iodine.
[01:17:23.759 --> 01:17:27.484]  It is all forms of it, energized,
[01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:37.400]  Active and ready to energize the body the iodine in x3 comes from thousands of feet below the earth's surface hit
[01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:44.915]  From the oxygenation and radiation and toxins that are on the surface for tens of thousands of years.
[01:17:44.935 --> 01:17:53.980]  X3, ladies and gentlemen, is the, from our research, ultimate form of true atomic iodine.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:18:00.724]  Fused with other forms of iodine and vitamin C to keep it in its energetic state.
[01:18:02.031 --> 01:18:09.239]  Look, I've got piles of papers and research and scientists I've been talking to for years, and to try to put it all in just a few minutes is impossible.
[01:18:09.799 --> 01:18:10.740]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:14.644]  The globalists are pumping our environment full of bad halogens.
[01:18:14.825 --> 01:18:17.247]  Fluoride is just part of that.
[01:18:17.968 --> 01:18:22.713]  Iodine is the good halogen that the human body absolutely has to have to operate.
[01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:27.046]  And they have done everything they can to take that out of the environment.
[01:18:27.506 --> 01:18:34.389]  So our quest to bring people the very best supplements, the very best nutraceuticals, it was clear that iodine was critical.
[01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:38.891]  And we've gone through several permutations, and our research just gets better and better and better.
[01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:41.352]  And every time you reformulate, you give it a new name.
[01:18:42.012 --> 01:18:44.193]  Well, X3 is a quantum leap.
[01:18:45.618 --> 01:18:47.279]  From X1 and X2.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.221]  And it's simply incredible.
[01:18:49.921 --> 01:18:52.163]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:57.647]  I want you to go research it, look at the facts for yourself, but it is amazing.
[01:18:58.428 --> 01:19:05.333]  And what it's done for my stamina, my focus, my libido, everything is just incredible.
[01:19:05.353 --> 01:19:06.294]  And then I realized why.
[01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:16.404]  The globalists have wanted to get it out of the food and out of the water and out of the food chain for 50, 60 years because iodine, for me, is like oxygen.
[01:19:18.343 --> 01:19:19.143]  It energizes.
[01:19:19.323 --> 01:19:20.523]  It gives life.
[01:19:20.643 --> 01:19:21.804]  It's everything.
[01:19:22.444 --> 01:19:30.185]  In your quest to have a better life for you, your family, your children, your wife, your husband, your co-workers, the military, police, you need to take care of yourselves.
[01:19:30.305 --> 01:19:32.605]  And iodine is the missing link.
[01:19:32.886 --> 01:19:33.166]  It's X3.
[01:19:33.186 --> 01:19:35.466]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:19:36.066 --> 01:19:44.528]  In 2-ounce and 1-ounce, it's 50% off out of the gates and free shipping as our newest special at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:44.788 --> 01:19:46.528]  I want you to experience.
[01:19:47.268 --> 01:19:50.834]  This critical element that you're supposed to have for yourself.
[01:19:56.184 --> 01:19:58.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.657 --> 01:20:25.403]  You see, ladies and gentlemen... It's hard to turn music that pretty off, isn't it?
[01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:36.731]  I've actually read the history books that even had scans in them of big broad page newspapers in England 250 years ago.
[01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:37.211]  240 years ago.
[01:20:37.231 --> 01:20:37.631]  200 years ago.
[01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:39.112]  And they were worried about one group.
[01:20:44.557 --> 01:20:52.842]  They weren't worried about the French, or the Spanish Empires, the Portuguese Empires, or the Dutch Empire that they were back and forth fighting with, usually allied with the Dutch.
[01:20:54.442 --> 01:20:57.924]  They were worried about Napoleon, you know, some during that period.
[01:20:59.005 --> 01:21:01.927]  But they were worried about the American system.
[01:21:04.748 --> 01:21:11.352]  Because they said, if you let everybody not have to get government licenses, you don't have to be a lord under the royal system, if everybody can go out
[01:21:12.278 --> 01:21:12.999]  I mean, prosperous.
[01:21:13.739 --> 01:21:17.003]  All the invention, all the science, everything's gonna come out of this country.
[01:21:18.564 --> 01:21:23.469]  When the US was only like 20 years old, it was already so successful that everyone was jealous of it.
[01:21:25.444 --> 01:21:32.185]  Except strangely enough, historically, there was this weird thing, because the Czars were usually in competition with the British Empire, so they kind of liked the U.S.
[01:21:33.165 --> 01:21:36.706]  And the French did as well, but that was mainly playing empires off against each other.
[01:21:36.746 --> 01:21:42.847]  But they talked about the American system, and we've got to, quote, strangle it in its crib.
[01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.448]  I mean, why does everybody want to get here, if it's so bad?
[01:21:48.768 --> 01:21:54.089]  Because we had a little more freedom, a lot more freedom in some cases than other places, to innovate.
[01:21:55.578 --> 01:22:01.502]  If you were born in Italy 200 years ago, 100 years ago, if you weren't from the right class, you went nowhere.
[01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:05.786]  You didn't have a chance to get out of what your family had been for thousands of years.
[01:22:06.526 --> 01:22:08.568]  And it's the same thing all over the world.
[01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:10.618]  It's like that in Japan.
[01:22:11.378 --> 01:22:13.539]  It's like that in everywhere.
[01:22:14.099 --> 01:22:17.481]  And America had this idea, and the idea spread.
[01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:20.523]  People didn't wear jackets like this and outfits like this.
[01:22:20.783 --> 01:22:21.984]  People didn't have universities.
[01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:23.284]  They didn't have three branches of government.
[01:22:23.545 --> 01:22:25.746]  They didn't have the way Supreme Courts are set up and everything.
[01:22:26.006 --> 01:22:26.666]  We did that!
[01:22:27.267 --> 01:22:27.807]  We did it!
[01:22:28.107 --> 01:22:28.647]  We did it!
[01:22:29.328 --> 01:22:31.369]  And it didn't take militaries or anything.
[01:22:33.362 --> 01:22:41.084]  To enforce that, it was better, it worked better, everyone imitated it, because everyone imitates success.
[01:22:43.685 --> 01:22:55.529]  Now fast forward, we've become decadent, we've become corrupt, we've been infiltrated by really bad groups that want to use our power, to project power, but at the same time are fearful of the power, that it might rise again.
[01:22:55.549 --> 01:23:02.531]  And these sick, evil, monopoly men have to be dealt with.
[01:23:04.462 --> 01:23:08.084]  And everything we're dealing with now is the overhang of the Robber Baron's attempt.
[01:23:09.665 --> 01:23:17.510]  About 120 years ago, they had full-page articles in Banking Digest that I've read on air and shown you years ago.
[01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:21.653]  I need to go back through all the stuff I used to do over a decade ago just proving this stuff existed.
[01:23:22.233 --> 01:23:23.714]  But back then it was an open conspiracy.
[01:23:23.734 --> 01:23:27.517]  It was, Americans are more literate than anyone else in the world on average.
[01:23:27.677 --> 01:23:29.598]  They're all reading and they're addicted to it.
[01:23:30.078 --> 01:23:33.781]  And the culture is about being rugged and individual and very aggressive and indomitable.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.470]  And they've got statements like, the Greek Iliads may have been fantasy, but we've actually raised what looks like, you know, the 300.
[01:23:43.932 --> 01:23:44.693]  It's stuff like that.
[01:23:45.768 --> 01:23:48.250]  And it's just like everywhere they won't put up with our crap.
[01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:50.352]  No one will lay that down to us.
[01:23:51.173 --> 01:23:52.634]  Now the blacks are picking it up.
[01:23:53.035 --> 01:23:58.539]  I mean, it's got these racist statements like that, that the blacks were being empowered and becoming free with Christian groups.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.642]  And they're just like, we got to get a handle on this right now.
[01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:08.608]  And globalism and everything you've seen is an attempt to seduce, overtake, use America's power.
[01:24:09.719 --> 01:24:17.722]  Small geographically, 4% of the world's population, we had half the wealth, 54% in 1958.
[01:24:22.164 --> 01:24:23.645]  So you know why I'm frustrated all the time?
[01:24:26.132 --> 01:24:42.125]  It's outrageously ridiculous how obvious this is and that Trump is Americana and is very, very pragmatic and is just like, why take the most powerful, beautiful, awesome, cool thing and crap all over it because you're intimidated by it?
[01:24:42.485 --> 01:24:44.226]  Why not ride the thing to victory?
[01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:52.553]  And why does Hollywood have this... I don't want to be profane here on air, but it's the only term that works.
[01:24:55.049 --> 01:24:58.530]  Why do they have the needle, you know what, syndrome?
[01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:02.571]  Where they've just got to run everything in the ground.
[01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:04.172]  Man, these are bad people!
[01:25:05.232 --> 01:25:09.433]  And the left and the globalists are in a concerted effort with, who do I always tell you?
[01:25:10.174 --> 01:25:16.436]  The chi-coms, the UN, the top megabanks, the propagandist Hollywood scum, the unelected EU.
[01:25:16.776 --> 01:25:20.957]  And that's the combine with huge third world populations they've enslaved and exploited.
[01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:42.756]  That they are then rampaging into Europe and rampaging into America because they want to fully capture our republics and not have real voting anymore by the outsider checkmate to literally exploit the West and turn us into giant warmock juggernaut hellships.
[01:25:44.016 --> 01:25:45.597]  You think Hitler was bad?
[01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:50.519]  If the United States goes pure evil like they've been trying to do, we are screwed.
[01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:55.858]  We have a responsibility to not let these people take over.
[01:25:56.459 --> 01:26:02.444]  Just like Lindsey Graham, finally, after McCain was gone, could be himself, and he said, my God, this is crap.
[01:26:03.044 --> 01:26:07.968]  And I tell you right now, you sure want power, and I hope you don't ever get it, because you're evil!
[01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:12.472]  And suddenly, everybody goes from hating him to loving him, because he's being real!
[01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:14.774]  And he's saying, you people want a power?
[01:26:14.955 --> 01:26:15.915]  You hate America?
[01:26:16.075 --> 01:26:17.577]  You're a bunch of damn liars!
[01:26:18.498 --> 01:26:19.919]  Because it's what they are!
[01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:25.751]  I don't dislike these poor folks, but let me tell you something.
[01:26:26.832 --> 01:26:31.274]  In almost all of Latin America now, they make the women go to factories and they give these kids U.N.
[01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:34.956]  run formula where their brains are like a third smaller.
[01:26:35.677 --> 01:26:44.862]  There's big scandals all over the world where they have microloans and encourage women to go to work, but they have to sign off and take all these vaccines and drink this milk that doesn't have enough protein or fat.
[01:26:45.362 --> 01:26:49.204]  And you've got giant... You know the IQ of Latin America is going straight down.
[01:26:49.524 --> 01:26:50.665]  Our IQ is going straight down.
[01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:57.955]  So, you've got a bunch of, like, people that didn't get the milk they needed for their brains.
[01:26:58.595 --> 01:27:10.998]  They're the worst of the worst in those countries, organized by the UN to slam in with Reuters and AP and Forbes and Soros saying, we're going to bring America and Europe down with these invasion forces.
[01:27:11.338 --> 01:27:13.919]  And then it happens, and I'm showing you Reuters last segment.
[01:27:14.139 --> 01:27:15.339]  I'm showing you!
[01:27:16.359 --> 01:27:18.160]  And Lou Dobbs isn't even allowed to say it!
[01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:24.994]  He's allowed to say it's great if he's George Soros, but Lou Dobbs can't go, oh look, Soros says he's funding it!
[01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.637]  Because George Soros dropped.
[01:27:31.471 --> 01:27:48.359]  In January of this year, $32 billion he bought into PayPal, he bought into Facebook, he bought into Twitter, he bought into all the major groups, he funded all the Democrats with double, triple the money they've ever had, and that's just the beginning.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.022]  They allowed this foreign, Nazi-collaborating globalist to dump $32 billion on the thing
[01:27:55.570 --> 01:28:00.072]  The Republicans haven't dumped one billion in this election cycle, and they're doing everything they can to fight this.
[01:28:00.472 --> 01:28:01.273]  They're the rich elite.
[01:28:02.253 --> 01:28:02.813]  These Democrats.
[01:28:03.413 --> 01:28:03.674]  Global.
[01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:08.736]  He's doing it with your taxpayer money he's swindled over the years.
[01:28:10.737 --> 01:28:14.818]  He's matching funds from the UN that they get from the US, and we're fighting 32 to 1.
[01:28:18.703 --> 01:28:19.143]  And guess what?
[01:28:19.183 --> 01:28:20.584]  We're still kicking their butt.
[01:28:21.485 --> 01:28:23.106]  So, that's why I'm so wound up, folks.
[01:28:23.246 --> 01:28:26.948]  This is our country really under 21st century warfare attack.
[01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.669]  And let me tell you who's listening.
[01:28:28.969 --> 01:28:30.230]  The president knows it's true.
[01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:40.797]  Because... I mean, I've done more studying than those generals he's got in that room with him on all these actual programs.
[01:28:41.829 --> 01:28:43.211]  Most of these guys play golf all day.
[01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:44.974]  I'm telling you what's going on here.
[01:28:45.655 --> 01:28:47.538]  And so the military, everybody's tuned in.
[01:28:47.799 --> 01:28:49.161]  So let the left not know what's going on.
[01:28:49.201 --> 01:28:49.481]  We know.
[01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.132]  I'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[01:28:57.152 --> 01:28:59.714]  We have a global exclusive right now.
[01:29:00.254 --> 01:29:10.401]  We have Andrew Torba, the CEO and founder of the only independent pro-free speech libertarian site in the world that allows social media activity, and that's Gap.
[01:29:10.742 --> 01:29:12.863]  Speak freely is their motto.
[01:29:13.484 --> 01:29:20.689]  Now we all know about the tragic events in Pittsburgh where 11 innocent people were gunned down by a psychotic anti-Semite.
[01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:31.015]  But now, Andrew Torba, who set up Gab so that everyone would have free speech, is being deplatformed, losing his server provider, losing PayPal.
[01:29:31.515 --> 01:29:33.296]  They're trying to take him offline.
[01:29:33.336 --> 01:29:40.300]  And CNN is spending more time demonizing Mr. Torba and the First Amendment than they are talking about the 11 that are dead.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:40.780]  And why?
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:47.364]  Because four minutes before this monster went in, he said to the world that he was going in.
[01:29:48.064 --> 01:29:52.409]  As if that means Mr. Torba's bad if somebody on a message board posted that.
[01:29:52.529 --> 01:29:57.535]  So we've been de-platformed, he's being de-platformed, big media with big tech wants to silence their competition.
[01:29:57.695 --> 01:29:59.077]  They always say, go build your own thing.
[01:29:59.597 --> 01:30:00.418]  And then they come after it.
[01:30:00.699 --> 01:30:02.881]  So Mr. Torba, thank you for giving us the time this Sunday.
[01:30:03.302 --> 01:30:04.022]  You've got the floor.
[01:30:04.062 --> 01:30:05.124]  Please break down what's happened.
[01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:07.816]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:30:07.996 --> 01:30:14.718]  First, I just want to say I'm heartbroken and disgusted by this awful attack, this awful showcase of violence.
[01:30:15.298 --> 01:30:23.360]  I've been praying, my family's been praying, our community has been praying for these victims and for their families and for their friends and for the community in Pittsburgh.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:29.481]  With that said, we've also been working with the Department of Justice and with the FBI very closely.
[01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:31.081]  We've been fully cooperative.
[01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:35.022]  GAAP stands for Individual Liberty and for Free Expression for All People.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:44.044]  We have hundreds of thousands of users from all around the world, from all different backgrounds, races, religions, beliefs, that express themselves on our site.
[01:30:45.245 --> 01:30:50.648]  I believe, fundamentally, that the answer to bad speech is always going to be more speech.
[01:30:51.348 --> 01:31:01.213]  In this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI now have concrete evidence for a motive that they can now use in a case to seek justice against this awful monster.
[01:31:02.269 --> 01:31:10.633]  We have always welcomed everybody, and we will continue to fight for free speech on the internet in the face of tyranny from the mainstream media smear attacks.
[01:31:11.094 --> 01:31:21.919]  Because for some reason, instead of focusing on the victims, instead of focusing on what happened, instead of focusing on this monster, they're focusing on Gab as a scapegoat.
[01:31:22.459 --> 01:31:23.560]  Gab did not kill anybody.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.861]  No social media post has ever killed anybody.
[01:31:26.651 --> 01:31:27.191]  No, no.
[01:31:28.252 --> 01:31:31.053]  The only person that is responsible here is the individual.
[01:31:31.614 --> 01:31:34.735]  And I just think it's disgusting that Gab is now being attacked.
[01:31:35.535 --> 01:31:36.296]  I'm being smeared.
[01:31:36.336 --> 01:31:39.837]  My face is being put up next to this guy as if I'm the terrorist.
[01:31:40.658 --> 01:31:44.560]  We're receiving death threats and enough hate on the Internet ourselves.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.021]  We wish nothing but
[01:31:48.141 --> 01:31:49.082]  Good for the world.
[01:31:49.542 --> 01:31:50.623]  We welcome all people.
[01:31:50.683 --> 01:31:51.363]  We always have.
[01:31:52.004 --> 01:31:54.926]  And we are all about individual liberty and free expression.
[01:31:55.627 --> 01:32:01.271]  We are fighting for the very things that, you know, those in the armed service fight to defend every day as well.
[01:32:01.771 --> 01:32:16.882]  And I think that if people can give their lives to defend these freedoms and these liberties that we cherish, I think that we'll be able to stand tall and take these attacks from the mainstream media, this onslaught, and this coordinated collusion from Silicon Valley to no platform us from the Internet.
[01:32:17.603 --> 01:32:18.684]  Gab is not going anywhere.
[01:32:19.084 --> 01:32:19.884]  We are not afraid.
[01:32:20.525 --> 01:32:22.826]  We will not bow down to the mainstream media.
[01:32:22.866 --> 01:32:23.666]  We will not cower.
[01:32:24.207 --> 01:32:27.769]  We are going to continue to fight, and the power of the people will propel us.
[01:32:28.749 --> 01:32:30.110]  We will continue to build.
[01:32:31.135 --> 01:32:33.136]  Whatever it takes, we're going to stay online.
[01:32:33.316 --> 01:32:35.338]  I don't care how long it takes, I don't care what it takes.
[01:32:35.998 --> 01:32:48.366]  We're going to provide a place where people can speak freely, under the protections of the First Amendment of the United States, without the tyranny of big tech, without the tyranny of the media, deciding what is real news and what isn't, and who can speak and who cannot.
[01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:58.692]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.162 --> 01:33:17.303]  Live, raw and unfiltered.
[01:33:18.324 --> 01:33:20.085]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.527 --> 01:33:24.768]  We're really doing it.
[01:33:25.929 --> 01:33:28.471]  We saw the globalists building their plan to abolish the country.
[01:33:29.191 --> 01:33:31.393]  For decades, the CFR was sucking us dry.
[01:33:32.393 --> 01:33:33.434]  We began to warn people.
[01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:34.355]  We built defenses.
[01:33:35.095 --> 01:33:35.916]  Things came true.
[01:33:36.576 --> 01:33:37.677]  Our credibility went way up.
[01:33:38.217 --> 01:33:38.938]  They censored us.
[01:33:39.298 --> 01:33:41.479]  Credibility went up even more because we told you it was coming.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.781]  Now the UN invasion force is here.
[01:33:45.623 --> 01:33:47.784]  And so, it's just incredible.
[01:33:49.025 --> 01:33:50.605]  We didn't just sit there on the bench.
[01:33:50.785 --> 01:33:51.926]  You didn't sit there on the bench.
[01:33:52.646 --> 01:33:54.827]  You got made fun of by your neighbors, by your family.
[01:33:55.727 --> 01:33:58.889]  Every cartoon movie made fun of New World Order, global government people.
[01:33:59.569 --> 01:34:01.510]  Now, yeah, world government's here.
[01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:03.711]  There's gonna be a world cashless society.
[01:34:03.751 --> 01:34:04.691]  You don't do what we say.
[01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:06.032]  You don't buy and sell.
[01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:08.593]  Our credibility just went up even more.
[01:34:10.334 --> 01:34:11.014]  So did the Bibles.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:13.580]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.101]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're a believer in reality.
[01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:20.202]  But let me put out the big quantum statement.
[01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:40.307]  If you don't choose America, if you don't choose Trump, if you don't choose sovereignty, if you don't choose what works in capitalism, and the sovereignty of the nation we paid for and built, and if you believe we're the worst thing in the world, then you're an idiot.
[01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:51.031]  I mean, the Chinese Communists don't have nursing homes for 99% of the public.
[01:34:51.612 --> 01:34:52.512]  There isn't daycare.
[01:34:52.552 --> 01:34:55.995]  The children are chained to power poles, and there's piles of crap everywhere.
[01:34:56.476 --> 01:35:00.299]  You go work 15 hours, then you go sleep in a container, and maybe you get one meal a day.
[01:35:01.277 --> 01:35:02.557]  They want us to compete with that.
[01:35:02.617 --> 01:35:04.458]  You don't compete with it by going to its level.
[01:35:04.558 --> 01:35:08.599]  You demand they have projects for their own people and build them up.
[01:35:08.659 --> 01:35:09.480]  They're not doing that.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:15.742]  They're only building up the weapons systems and the industrial power of the CHICOMS to leverage out the U.S.
[01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:19.683]  and Europe because traitors in our own government went over there and set it up!
[01:35:22.024 --> 01:35:23.264]  And I... Yeah, back out.
[01:35:23.304 --> 01:35:25.385]  That's a photo of kids chained up at the power poles.
[01:35:26.428 --> 01:35:27.229]  We're at the light pulse.
[01:35:27.349 --> 01:35:30.091]  So that's what goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:31.032 --> 01:35:38.960]  And the globalists are totally cold-blooded and they know that you have a conscience.
[01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:47.067]  And so you see what the mainstream media always little cropped photos from a bigger photo of a woman holding her kid up
[01:35:47.935 --> 01:35:49.836]  And there's a riot cop in front of her with a club.
[01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:54.459]  They don't pull the picture back, and you see guys throwing rocks at him ten feet behind her.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.463]  It just looks like he's about to hit a woman in the head, meanwhile he's just got a shield, because five rocks are coming at him!
[01:36:00.623 --> 01:36:02.284]  But she's up there with the kid!
[01:36:02.604 --> 01:36:04.306]  She ought to have her ass thrown in prison!
[01:36:06.507 --> 01:36:15.433]  But you see, all the photos that the media, you've seen all over in the last few months, in the last few weeks, two-year-old baby held up,
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.221]  There's the riot cop.
[01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:19.342]  But you notice he's not like this at her.
[01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:20.062]  He's not about to hit her.
[01:36:20.262 --> 01:36:21.583]  He's just like this with a shield.
[01:36:22.504 --> 01:36:24.505]  And then you see another photo of it.
[01:36:24.785 --> 01:36:25.526]  Oh my God.
[01:36:26.066 --> 01:36:28.888]  And there is the group of people throwing firebombs.
[01:36:29.708 --> 01:36:33.911]  And rocks and helicopters and just all of the insanity.
[01:36:36.272 --> 01:36:40.015]  And every last area that hasn't collapsed, it's got to be taken over.
[01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:41.376]  It's got to be taken over.
[01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:42.556]  It's got to be run down.
[01:36:42.636 --> 01:36:43.617]  It's got to be controlled.
[01:36:46.365 --> 01:36:49.427]  The Democrats are there to organize them, the Socialists are there to control them.
[01:36:51.969 --> 01:36:56.732]  Paul Joseph Watson, viral video, shows migrant caravan members throwing rocks at helicopter.
[01:36:56.793 --> 01:36:57.113]  Get it!
[01:36:57.333 --> 01:36:58.874]  Infowars.com, get it out!
[01:36:59.234 --> 01:37:11.663]  Project Veritas has released unbelievable video out of the main headquarters down in South Texas, where Beto's supposedly from, Pito's from, I'm sorry, Beto's is the name of Pito.
[01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:17.172]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:20.276 --> 01:37:21.799]  And he's there with the UN.
[01:37:21.819 --> 01:37:23.782]  50% of his funds come from Soros.
[01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:24.943]  That's Associated Press.
[01:37:26.306 --> 01:37:33.692]  And Mastercard and the UN funding all the illegals coming up to El Paso and McAllen where they're already there.
[01:37:33.732 --> 01:37:35.193]  They say, we've got a new caravan today.
[01:37:35.213 --> 01:37:37.414]  Everybody's like, well the caravan hasn't gotten there yet.
[01:37:37.755 --> 01:37:38.996]  There's caravans every day.
[01:37:39.356 --> 01:37:40.377]  We've been down there for years.
[01:37:41.618 --> 01:37:48.423]  I begged listeners five years ago when we first got footage to make it a big deal and Drudge linked to it and still no one covered it.
[01:37:50.347 --> 01:37:53.870]  Hundreds of buses a day, loaded with people.
[01:37:54.090 --> 01:38:00.014]  But on local news, it's like, the United Nations is here, running the refugee program, helping with the children.
[01:38:00.335 --> 01:38:01.596]  Bunch of military-age men behind them.
[01:38:02.516 --> 01:38:05.479]  And I'm like, the UN, the UN, here's the document, the UN runs it.
[01:38:06.139 --> 01:38:08.061]  Shut up, Jones, the UN runs it.
[01:38:08.141 --> 01:38:09.942]  Oh yeah, right, sure.
[01:38:10.362 --> 01:38:17.408]  Hey look, they're killing cops all over the US, saying they've got to go under Strong Cities Initiative, where the UN is the new police board and runs them.
[01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:25.751]  And people go, oh, you're insane when it's Loretta Lynch officially doing it.
[01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:29.452]  So that's what I'm getting at here is folks, listen.
[01:38:31.052 --> 01:38:32.093]  We're under invasion.
[01:38:32.533 --> 01:38:38.774]  It's a consortium of corporations and dictatorships working in tandem to conquer what's left of the free world.
[01:38:39.275 --> 01:38:41.055]  And it doesn't mean America and Europe's perfect.
[01:38:41.735 --> 01:38:43.176]  But let me tell you something.
[01:38:43.236 --> 01:38:43.916]  We go down.
[01:38:44.929 --> 01:38:54.456]  Katie, bar the door, because these globalists have got some really bad plans for you and your family, and they lie to you, show arrogantly, and they tell you these things.
[01:38:54.556 --> 01:38:55.157]  It's insane.
[01:38:55.257 --> 01:38:58.079]  Now, I'm going to give the number up.
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:03.883]  When we come back, I'm going to air this piece that I asked one of our great editors, McBrain, to put together this morning.
[01:39:03.903 --> 01:39:06.625]  He did it very quickly, where Jon Stewart
[01:39:07.489 --> 01:39:12.232]  Has come out from hiding, crawled out from under the rock he's hiding under, with a nice guy act.
[01:39:12.252 --> 01:39:12.952]  He's the good cop.
[01:39:13.473 --> 01:39:15.114]  You know his brother's one of the top globalists.
[01:39:16.234 --> 01:39:17.355]  And, oh yeah.
[01:39:18.015 --> 01:39:20.477]  And, oh, he's there with Dave Chappelle, so it's alright.
[01:39:20.837 --> 01:39:22.998]  Dave Chappelle wants to bring everybody together, white and black.
[01:39:23.259 --> 01:39:28.122]  Man, I went to one of his shows, the most anti-white, racist crap I ever heard.
[01:39:28.722 --> 01:39:30.363]  I left with my wife halfway into it.
[01:39:32.503 --> 01:39:38.465]  So let me tell you, he's got what he says in public, and then when he says something in an arena, I was like, my God, I'm getting out of here.
[01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:47.367]  But the point is, is that they're up there, the cool guys, and we come back, and man, they say Trump's crazy.
[01:39:47.427 --> 01:39:55.649]  It's like he says it's Mad Max and Thunderdome, when it's great in the Middle East, and it's great in North Africa, it's great in Latin America, and we need to bring all these people in.
[01:39:55.929 --> 01:39:57.210]  What the hell is he talking about?
[01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:01.151]  So we're gonna juxtapose what he said with the video and the audio coming up.
[01:40:03.032 --> 01:40:04.354]  Then I'm going to give the number out right now.
[01:40:04.374 --> 01:40:10.842]  I'm going to take your calls throughout the entire third hour ahead of Joel Gilbert coming up at
[01:40:11.877 --> 01:40:13.919]  This number, but I want to take first-time callers.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:17.063]  They haven't done that in about a week.
[01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:17.824]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:40:17.844 --> 01:40:18.184]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:40:18.745 --> 01:40:25.832]  First-time callers, or if you've been on hold at the end of the show and I didn't get to you and I apologize, you too are on.
[01:40:26.033 --> 01:40:30.458]  So, been on hold, haven't gone on in the last few weeks, or first-time caller, 877-789-2539.
[01:40:34.724 --> 01:40:39.770]  I want to go to Border Patrol or Regular Army or I don't want to think Classified or Secret.
[01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:40.831]  Believe me, I already know all of it.
[01:40:40.851 --> 01:40:41.912]  I'm not bragging, I just do.
[01:40:42.653 --> 01:40:46.077]  But about what you think about the border deployment, is it enough?
[01:40:46.177 --> 01:40:47.778]  Only a few hundred have showed up so far.
[01:40:48.519 --> 01:40:50.281]  Fifteen thousand are supposed to be there in the next month.
[01:40:50.582 --> 01:40:51.222]  That's not enough.
[01:40:51.262 --> 01:40:52.023]  They're busting them up.
[01:40:52.223 --> 01:40:53.745]  They're going to hit in the next two or three days.
[01:40:54.186 --> 01:40:55.867]  They're already hitting right now, as I told you.
[01:40:56.628 --> 01:41:04.592]  But the big, aggressive, militarized ones with firebombs and ball-off cocktails and guns, including AK-47s, these are a U.N.
[01:41:04.632 --> 01:41:08.894]  jihadi invasion force with hardcore commies holding up their kids right in front of them.
[01:41:09.775 --> 01:41:11.195]  So, what's your take on that?
[01:41:11.215 --> 01:41:13.977]  You'll go to the head of the line, at least for the first few calls.
[01:41:13.997 --> 01:41:14.317]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[01:41:14.337 --> 01:41:14.557]  And then,
[01:41:21.766 --> 01:41:22.847]  People are like, man, why are you so fired up?
[01:41:24.509 --> 01:41:26.451]  The globalists are trying to literally destroy me.
[01:41:26.551 --> 01:41:27.633]  I'm just a loyal American.
[01:41:27.673 --> 01:41:28.574]  It's all happening.
[01:41:29.074 --> 01:41:32.338]  The Democrats are literally globalist invasion force leaders.
[01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:33.880]  I mean, I'm a loyal American.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.381]  Pick your side, people!
[01:41:35.541 --> 01:41:36.543]  This isn't rhetoric!
[01:41:38.032 --> 01:41:41.915]  They want me off the air, and you off the air, and thousands of others ahead of this!
[01:41:42.115 --> 01:41:43.496]  They're planning bombs!
[01:41:43.536 --> 01:41:44.977]  They're planning false flags!
[01:41:45.177 --> 01:41:46.478]  They're planning mass shootings!
[01:41:46.699 --> 01:41:47.980]  They're planning race riots!
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.521]  Every Hollywood show, every movie is race war!
[01:41:50.762 --> 01:41:53.003]  This is total globalist BS!
[01:41:56.126 --> 01:41:57.367]  And we need your financial support.
[01:41:58.308 --> 01:42:00.269]  Plus, you need the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:00.369 --> 01:42:07.452]  If you don't wear your colors proud, we've got shirts that'll only help you meet Patreons that say things like Molon Labe or things like that.
[01:42:07.472 --> 01:42:08.713]  Or, you want to really get in the fight...
[01:42:10.265 --> 01:42:11.546]  They'll try to kill you in Blueberry.
[01:42:11.666 --> 01:42:13.646]  It's amazing to see how criminal they are.
[01:42:14.007 --> 01:42:17.248]  Or a Trump Pants 2020 shirt, or an Alex Jones shirt, or an InfoWars shirt.
[01:42:17.528 --> 01:42:30.433]  We've got incredible designs of George Washington, French and Indian War, and just all sorts of other really cool, the InfoWars Tiananmen Square Tank Man shirt, and Re-Elect 45 shirt, and Forbidden Information shirts.
[01:42:30.453 --> 01:42:33.835]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:34.475 --> 01:42:35.536]  And, X3.
[01:42:36.855 --> 01:42:40.456]  They tried to suppress us, but that which did not stop us only made us stronger.
[01:42:40.916 --> 01:42:50.538]  We now have X3, even better deep-earth crystals, with two other forms of iodine for activation, a tiny amount of vitamin C to make it come into the magic formula of X3.
[01:42:55.679 --> 01:42:57.879]  An energized quantum state.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:01.820]  Or an energized atomic state.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.260]  What does that mean?
[01:43:04.341 --> 01:43:05.441]  It means it's pure.
[01:43:06.661 --> 01:43:18.250]  And it means the properties of what it does in the body in interaction with other properties is pure, is unadulterated, is original, is first generation.
[01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:30.934]  This has been quite a quest for Info Wars when we discovered that there's a whole UN world government plan to remove even crappy forms of iodine out of food so that people can't absorb it.
[01:43:30.954 --> 01:43:36.656]  When I say crappy forms, I mean types that are bound to other elements so your body doesn't get absorption.
[01:43:37.496 --> 01:43:43.158]  This is an essential element in the body, just like vitamin C, just like oxygen, just like water.
[01:43:44.326 --> 01:43:57.932]  At first, doing research, we got the best seaweed base that was still weak, and we had issues with supply, and then leftists found out six years ago that we were involved, that it was Infowars, so they cut us off.
[01:43:58.672 --> 01:44:06.776]  And then we came into X2 that was from oil and gas drilling at about 7,000 to 12,000 feet, getting pure crystals for truly pure iodine.
[01:44:06.916 --> 01:44:09.577]  We had to go to the DEA to get it, all these controls.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.225]  Then the oil companies caught on that we were getting it, and they tried to jack up prices and cause us problems.
[01:44:15.265 --> 01:44:18.629]  And I didn't want to raise prices, so I cut my contract off with them.
[01:44:19.650 --> 01:44:27.179]  And we went out and did a huge industry research and found out we could get the same deep earth crystals, probably even purer.
[01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:29.621]  You're talking about like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, you know, percent purer.
[01:44:31.028 --> 01:44:38.169]  And then the chemists and others explained to us that you need other types of basic iodine to make sure it gets fully absorbed.
[01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:40.510]  So this has all three types of iodine.
[01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:51.412]  And then it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that doesn't let it oxidize and basically keeps it in its energetic state, or its quantum state, its atomic state.
[01:44:51.812 --> 01:44:56.793]  Again, atomic doesn't mean radioactive, that just means it's pure on the periodic table.
[01:44:58.237 --> 01:44:59.298]  This is X3.
[01:44:59.638 --> 01:45:08.285]  I am so excited about X3 that out of the gate we're bringing it to you at 50% off in the 1 ounce and the 2 ounce bottles.
[01:45:08.305 --> 01:45:10.506]  Now we didn't have X2 in a 2 ounce bottle.
[01:45:10.526 --> 01:45:13.108]  We do for X3 so you can stock up on it.
[01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:17.592]  It really is beyond game changing.
[01:45:17.672 --> 01:45:19.613]  It's essential.
[01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:26.839]  Survival Shield X3, nascent tri-iodine in 2 ounce and in 1 ounce bottles.
[01:45:28.134 --> 01:45:32.078]  You don't just get a key element that's essential to human life on this planet.
[01:45:33.319 --> 01:45:37.884]  You also fund an operation that's promoting the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the whole nine yards.
[01:45:38.184 --> 01:45:51.177]  I mean, quite frankly, I've got all these scientific documents and all these notes from chemists and all these facts, but I'm just going to tell the viewers, just like our information has changed the world, just like it pisses the establishment off, anything I'm going to bring you is the very best.
[01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:52.999]  It's like any of our products.
[01:45:53.119 --> 01:45:54.780]  I'm like, what is the top product?
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:55.820]  What is the best tested?
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.421]  What is absolutely highest rated?
[01:45:57.961 --> 01:46:02.063]  I want to put a formula out stronger and better and lower the price.
[01:46:02.724 --> 01:46:03.804]  We're always innovating.
[01:46:03.844 --> 01:46:04.885]  We're always researching.
[01:46:05.485 --> 01:46:15.811]  But quite frankly, it's been oppression and it's the people trying to block our supply chain that made us go out and really do the hard work to discover what is the very best documented form of iodine.
[01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:23.133]  And it's all three types fused together, energized by a small amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it.
[01:46:23.153 --> 01:46:26.534]  Three forms of iodine is better than one.
[01:46:27.454 --> 01:46:29.674]  And so, that's why X3 is so amazing.
[01:46:30.194 --> 01:46:37.336]  That's why all the results we've got and the trials we have with the crew and others are so breathtakingly cool.
[01:46:37.436 --> 01:46:43.558]  If you like X2, you're gonna love X3 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:43.878 --> 01:46:44.478]  The next level.
[01:46:55.658 --> 01:47:01.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.664 --> 01:47:05.344]  Big Brother.
[01:47:05.805 --> 01:47:07.025]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:07.606 --> 01:47:08.706]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:09.507 --> 01:47:10.928]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:11.188 --> 01:47:12.249]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:12.829 --> 01:47:17.612]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.594 --> 01:47:22.936]  So, it's in the WikiLeaks, two years ago plus,
[01:47:24.398 --> 01:47:29.648]  Where you've got top psychological warfare professors sending Hillary emails saying, we gotta go race war, we gotta go culture war.
[01:47:29.768 --> 01:47:30.930]  Every level, everybody's fighting.
[01:47:31.471 --> 01:47:32.754]  Kneeling near the national anthem.
[01:47:33.115 --> 01:47:33.856]  Whites are bad.
[01:47:33.876 --> 01:47:34.738]  America's bad.
[01:47:35.138 --> 01:47:36.280]  Just to cause total division.
[01:47:37.534 --> 01:47:41.296]  Because people want prosperity, and we can't deal with Trump's message.
[01:47:41.316 --> 01:47:42.277]  You just make it race war.
[01:47:42.757 --> 01:47:45.799]  Well, FODO, NFL cheerleader, takes a knee during National Anthem.
[01:47:46.299 --> 01:47:49.801]  She'll get lots of attention from the media, and she's saying America's bad.
[01:47:49.821 --> 01:47:50.702]  She's saying she's bad.
[01:47:51.362 --> 01:47:53.523]  Because, quote, minorities are the majority now in most areas.
[01:47:53.844 --> 01:47:54.504]  It's your country.
[01:47:55.705 --> 01:47:59.387]  But they don't want you to identify with private property and right to self-defense and all this.
[01:47:59.407 --> 01:48:01.308]  No, they want you to identify with socialism and communism.
[01:48:01.328 --> 01:48:04.170]  That's what Michael Moore says.
[01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:05.991]  The demographics of white people dying
[01:48:08.052 --> 01:48:15.375]  He means, oh, we think we can brainwash minorities because they're stupid, he thinks, into supporting not wanting what made America great.
[01:48:16.816 --> 01:48:17.356]  Bill Kristol.
[01:48:17.396 --> 01:48:20.298]  Lazy, white, working class Americans should be replaced by immigrants.
[01:48:20.318 --> 01:48:22.279]  Remember that?
[01:48:23.379 --> 01:48:25.120]  New York Times op-ed this week.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.521]  Brags of replacing embittered white conservative minority.
[01:48:28.681 --> 01:48:29.802]  Literal white genocide.
[01:48:33.304 --> 01:48:33.704]  Opinion.
[01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:35.545]  We can replace them.
[01:48:35.805 --> 01:48:36.225]  White people.
[01:48:38.131 --> 01:48:40.552]  And you go, oh my god, they say get rid of whites, it's white genocide.
[01:48:41.292 --> 01:48:43.453]  Michelle Goldberg, I should say, is almost white.
[01:48:44.653 --> 01:48:46.914]  And then it's like, oh, they're crazy, they say we want to replace them.
[01:48:47.934 --> 01:48:51.295]  Michael Moore tells angry white American guys to give it up!
[01:48:52.255 --> 01:48:53.255]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:48:53.316 --> 01:48:53.956]  Well, I agree.
[01:48:53.976 --> 01:48:58.017]  Doesn't seem to be a bunch of weird, evil white people doing all this.
[01:48:58.817 --> 01:49:00.658]  How can I cure my white guilt?
[01:49:00.758 --> 01:49:01.358]  New York Times.
[01:49:02.725 --> 01:49:03.905]  Do whatever we say, that's how you do it.
[01:49:04.326 --> 01:49:07.827]  See, now it's like, ooh, you're bad, everyone's, you're white.
[01:49:08.167 --> 01:49:12.448]  They're all like KKK now because they got taught it's okay to be racist if it's a white, see?
[01:49:12.788 --> 01:49:15.269]  We're gonna, don't be scared, do whatever we say.
[01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:17.730]  But it's not minorities that are even doing it.
[01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:22.291]  It's weird white controllers getting some minorities to get into this weird cult.
[01:49:22.371 --> 01:49:23.152]  This is sick.
[01:49:23.792 --> 01:49:24.952]  God, this is so cold-blooded.
[01:49:25.472 --> 01:49:27.413]  Can my children be friends with white people?
[01:49:27.453 --> 01:49:27.953]  New York Times.
[01:49:28.353 --> 01:49:29.754]  Probably not, she says.
[01:49:29.874 --> 01:49:30.374]  They're bad.
[01:49:32.136 --> 01:49:33.077]  Inherently a group.
[01:49:33.657 --> 01:49:35.399]  White women, come get your people.
[01:49:35.439 --> 01:49:35.739]  That's right.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:40.563]  Oh, the establishment gets women scared and says, come with us and we won't kill you.
[01:49:41.504 --> 01:49:43.206]  Like Humongous says in Road Warrior.
[01:49:43.966 --> 01:49:44.907]  Just give us the gas.
[01:49:45.207 --> 01:49:45.988]  Spare your lives.
[01:49:46.749 --> 01:49:47.890]  It's a reasonable proposition.
[01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:50.992]  And you know what happens when they try to... Humongous kills them.
[01:49:51.933 --> 01:49:52.954]  Bring in the radical Muslims.
[01:49:53.014 --> 01:49:54.155]  It's so good in their countries.
[01:49:55.456 --> 01:49:56.117]  Thanks, Islam.
[01:49:58.413 --> 01:50:01.316]  Why white supremacists are chugging milk and why geneticists are alarmed?
[01:50:01.416 --> 01:50:03.077]  I'm not joking.
[01:50:03.138 --> 01:50:03.858]  Milk is racist.
[01:50:03.878 --> 01:50:04.439]  New York Times.
[01:50:05.079 --> 01:50:06.240]  They make everything racist.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:06.701]  Don Lemon.
[01:50:07.261 --> 01:50:08.723]  Whites are the biggest terrorists.
[01:50:08.763 --> 01:50:09.604]  They're the inherent evil.
[01:50:11.065 --> 01:50:15.029]  He word for word says, you don't want to talk about people as a group, but whites are evil.
[01:50:16.130 --> 01:50:16.991]  That's all just lately.
[01:50:18.772 --> 01:50:23.417]  And now in Fort Worth, Texas, someone put up, it's okay to be white flyers.
[01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.119]  We put them out saying it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black.
[01:50:27.419 --> 01:50:28.360]  Nobody bet on that.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.161]  It's great to be human was the full buster.
[01:50:32.282 --> 01:50:34.783]  And oh, everyone agrees, this is bad.
[01:50:35.303 --> 01:50:36.584]  Oh no, white is bad.
[01:50:36.604 --> 01:50:39.125]  And they just go find the people.
[01:50:41.311 --> 01:50:43.973]  The followers, the slaves, the idiots, like virtue signal.
[01:50:44.474 --> 01:50:45.695]  I think it's very frightening.
[01:50:45.935 --> 01:50:48.597]  They're just all over the news saying whites are inherently bad.
[01:50:48.617 --> 01:50:50.579]  And then look, he's a good leftist.
[01:50:50.659 --> 01:50:51.920]  He tears it down.
[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:56.004]  What did they show in the New York Times yesterday about Soros?
[01:50:56.044 --> 01:50:58.306]  Yeah, he gave 32 billion this year to crush Trump.
[01:51:00.427 --> 01:51:07.794]  And it shows in Hungary, Soros activists pulling down with metal scrapers.
[01:51:09.124 --> 01:51:10.165]  With metal scrapers.
[01:51:12.026 --> 01:51:17.128]  The Soros sign put up during the campaign saying Soros has spent billions trying to overthrow our country.
[01:51:17.528 --> 01:51:18.969]  Let's not let this guy do this to us.
[01:51:19.009 --> 01:51:21.070]  Let's vote for our sovereignty and control our borders.
[01:51:21.551 --> 01:51:26.153]  But the good Soros people, thank God, they came out and they all tore down that billboard.
[01:51:26.173 --> 01:51:26.573]  Yay!
[01:51:29.608 --> 01:51:39.512]  And this person walks over, it's not okay to be white, I'm an old weird white lady, I'm gonna virtue signal, and I'm gonna walk over and I'm gonna tear that down.
[01:51:40.132 --> 01:51:47.435]  We pull up yesterday's New York Times, it was something like, uh, Soros, once the target of the fringe, now mainstream right wing attack him.
[01:51:47.735 --> 01:51:54.057]  He didn't do anything, he just gave 32 billion this year, all other Republican spending outnumbered 30 to 1, 32 to 1.
[01:51:56.365 --> 01:51:58.127]  My God, he's just 32 billion.
[01:51:58.608 --> 01:52:01.150]  He just funds half of O'Rourke and a UN invasion force.
[01:52:01.471 --> 01:52:02.852]  My goodness, why are they upset?
[01:52:02.872 --> 01:52:07.878]  Yeah, the New York Times did a whole video attacking me and Glenn Beck about it.
[01:52:08.298 --> 01:52:09.780]  You show the New York Times articles what I'm saying.
[01:52:11.849 --> 01:52:15.791]  It's titled, you know, once fringe who attacks Soros, now it's mainline Republican.
[01:52:16.371 --> 01:52:21.575]  And then it says, yeah, he basically runs everything, but we're tearing down signs against him.
[01:52:21.615 --> 01:52:22.615]  So don't worry.
[01:52:22.655 --> 01:52:22.915]  There it is.
[01:52:22.955 --> 01:52:25.637]  How vilification of George Soros moved from the fringes to mainstream.
[01:52:25.657 --> 01:52:26.157]  Now scroll down.
[01:52:27.518 --> 01:52:29.699]  Or I guess you've got the video up there.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:35.303]  There's an article and the article is him pulling down signs saying he's against free speech.
[01:52:36.944 --> 01:52:40.166]  I mean, you talk about solid gold.
[01:52:42.022 --> 01:52:44.523]  But again, that's what the left's all about, is contradicting.
[01:52:44.943 --> 01:52:46.904]  How dare him say Soros is behind it.
[01:52:47.024 --> 01:52:48.105]  I have Soros in Reuters.
[01:52:48.585 --> 01:52:49.525]  Document Cam, shot, please.
[01:52:50.746 --> 01:52:59.950]  Funding the Middle Eastern, the African, and the Latin American invasions, with MasterCard paying them thousands of dollars per leg to do it.
[01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:01.591]  That's Reuters!
[01:53:01.671 --> 01:53:03.712]  Two years ago, Reuters!
[01:53:04.172 --> 01:53:04.792]  Reuters!
[01:53:05.092 --> 01:53:06.653]  But don't worry, people
[01:53:07.659 --> 01:53:10.020]  They've rejected it, so now they're denying he's behind it.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:10.981]  He's not behind it.
[01:53:11.221 --> 01:53:12.722]  It's not illegal to fund human smuggling.
[01:53:12.962 --> 01:53:13.942]  There's nothing going on.
[01:53:14.182 --> 01:53:15.083]  He didn't do anything.
[01:53:15.103 --> 01:53:17.644]  But then we've got Jon Stewart.
[01:53:19.685 --> 01:53:21.506]  Jon Stewart, that little sweetsie.
[01:53:23.387 --> 01:53:24.788]  And he's just up there being nice.
[01:53:24.808 --> 01:53:29.870]  He's like, Trump says the borders are collapsing, and it's like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.
[01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:30.751]  That's ridiculous.
[01:53:31.131 --> 01:53:32.692]  It's far worse, Mr. Stewart.
[01:53:32.932 --> 01:53:33.292]  Here it is.
[01:53:34.445 --> 01:53:35.806]  Not much in the midterms.
[01:53:36.367 --> 01:53:39.769]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:43.933]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:53:47.896 --> 01:53:56.163]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:53:56.523 --> 01:53:56.844]  Muslims.
[01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:05.032]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:08.594]  Guys, do me a favor.
[01:54:09.635 --> 01:54:10.796]  Bring me yesterday's stack, please.
[01:54:12.357 --> 01:54:15.240]  Because I want to go through it, because I'm going to show people like I did yesterday.
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.101]  Because I'm going to do it.
[01:54:19.443 --> 01:54:21.324]  Soros' people pulling down billboards.
[01:54:21.385 --> 01:54:23.826]  Yes, you found the version of the video in the New York Times.
[01:54:23.846 --> 01:54:26.989]  There's an article of the same headline that is an article.
[01:54:27.529 --> 01:54:29.291]  And it's got them pulling down the billboards.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.260]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:32.361]  I know there's a video.
[01:54:38.522 --> 01:54:41.163]  You're hearing Jeopardy music now in the background, folks, because I sure am.
[01:54:41.663 --> 01:54:42.163]  There it is.
[01:54:42.824 --> 01:54:44.064]  Oh, that's a video.
[01:54:47.825 --> 01:54:48.665]  Okay, let's do this.
[01:54:48.705 --> 01:54:49.606]  We had the video yesterday.
[01:54:49.646 --> 01:54:50.866]  I want to play the video, then.
[01:54:52.307 --> 01:54:54.287]  We're going to play the video, then I'm going to come out there.
[01:54:54.307 --> 01:54:55.027]  No big deal.
[01:54:56.928 --> 01:55:00.409]  And I'm going to get it out of my yesterday's stack.
[01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:10.207]  Because yesterday, STAC has them with the photo of activists in Hungary pulling down the billboards.
[01:55:11.528 --> 01:55:13.609]  Because I have to show everyone what I say.
[01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:15.710]  Because they say it doesn't exist.
[01:55:15.871 --> 01:55:16.391]  I will show you.
[01:55:16.651 --> 01:55:21.814]  But again, George Soros MasterCard to partner to aid migrants and refugees.
[01:55:22.255 --> 01:55:23.736]  Reuters reporting on it all.
[01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:27.078]  Officially Reuters, officially MasterCard is announcing
[01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:37.201]  And I have MasterCard officially announcing that they are paying for it all with George Soros from MasterCard.com.
[01:55:38.362 --> 01:55:39.423]  But they say it doesn't exist.
[01:55:39.463 --> 01:55:41.104]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[01:55:41.124 --> 01:55:43.006]  That's MasterCard.com.
[01:55:43.587 --> 01:55:45.128]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:45.448 --> 01:55:46.809]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:46.889 --> 01:55:48.251]  With George Soros funding it.
[01:55:48.471 --> 01:55:49.692]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:49.912 --> 01:55:51.053]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:51.233 --> 01:55:53.335]  Telling you, their enemy, that it isn't happening.
[01:55:54.916 --> 01:55:55.997]  Let's go to the New York Times piece.
[01:55:56.017 --> 01:55:56.298]  Here it is.
[01:55:57.230 --> 01:55:57.930]  George Soros.
[01:55:58.331 --> 01:56:02.113]  The caravan I feel that all these people are being paid on.
[01:56:02.153 --> 01:56:04.995]  I believe it's paid for by George Soros.
[01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:10.858]  George Soros, the billionaire Democratic fundraiser who has long been villainized in certain right-wing circles.
[01:56:10.958 --> 01:56:13.980]  Billionaire George Soros bankrolls the resistance.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.423]  He's been the target of anti-semitic smears and is often at the center of conspiracy theories.
[01:56:19.623 --> 01:56:20.724]  Who's behind the puppets?
[01:56:21.084 --> 01:56:22.045]  Who's the puppet master?
[01:56:23.177 --> 01:56:23.958]  George Soros.
[01:56:24.498 --> 01:56:31.463]  Accused of everything from secretly influencing left-wing policy to funding a caravan of migrants going north toward the United States.
[01:56:31.763 --> 01:56:33.705]  Well, who do you think is behind these caravans?
[01:56:33.765 --> 01:56:35.746]  A lot of speculation that it's George Soros.
[01:56:35.786 --> 01:56:36.587]  George Soros.
[01:56:36.607 --> 01:56:37.267]  George Soros.
[01:56:37.287 --> 01:56:38.348]  The likes of Soros.
[01:56:38.448 --> 01:56:41.330]  These fabulations have been common on the fringes for years.
[01:56:41.491 --> 01:56:44.633]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[01:56:44.813 --> 01:56:49.214]  But now, his name saturates nearly every corner of the GOP ecosystem.
[01:56:49.554 --> 01:56:52.615]  You hear it from voters in small towns in Southern Illinois.
[01:56:52.715 --> 01:56:53.176]  Soros.
[01:56:53.256 --> 01:56:56.156]  George Soros, I believe, is paying all these people.
[01:56:56.277 --> 01:56:58.917]  On primetime newscasts on Fox... George Soros.
[01:57:01.118 --> 01:57:02.698]  Even from the President himself.
[01:57:02.899 --> 01:57:03.779]  George Soros!
[01:57:04.079 --> 01:57:09.861]  The longtime investor and philanthropist became the target of misinformation and conspiracies starting in the 1990s.
[01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:17.943]  Extremists in the US and Europe cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world.
[01:57:18.243 --> 01:57:21.924]  A front man for the House of Rothschild called George Soros.
[01:57:22.485 --> 01:57:23.485]  Bilderberg Group.
[01:57:24.085 --> 01:57:28.568]  But Soros is no longer only invoked in fringe anti-Semitic conspiracies.
[01:57:29.029 --> 01:57:37.835]  In 2004, he became a target for Republicans more broadly, when he donated $27 million in an effort to defeat then-President George W. Bush.
[01:57:37.915 --> 01:57:42.038]  If we re-elect President Bush, we are telling the world that we've...
[01:57:49.208 --> 01:57:51.329]  Let's go to Jason in New Mexico.
[01:57:51.389 --> 01:57:51.910]  Fire away.
[01:57:51.970 --> 01:57:53.050]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:55.832]  Shout out to you, the crew, and all those that work behind the scenes.
[01:57:55.852 --> 01:58:06.597]  And I will tell everybody to commit to the super blue toothpaste and the Survival Shield X2 so you don't turn into a transsexual gay toad and run as a... Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[01:58:06.657 --> 01:58:06.837]  Hey!
[01:58:08.338 --> 01:58:11.339]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:15.201]  I'm not gonna have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[01:58:15.301 --> 01:58:21.864]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[01:58:21.904 --> 01:58:26.266]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[01:58:26.366 --> 01:58:32.809]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to to see it at work on a daily basis.
[01:58:33.089 --> 01:58:36.671]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[01:58:36.691 --> 01:58:39.212]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[01:58:39.292 --> 01:58:43.533]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[01:58:43.613 --> 01:58:53.257]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product, and I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and it's like, oh, I just throw away $10.
[01:58:53.618 --> 01:58:57.799]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste, especially if you love your kids.
[01:58:57.839 --> 01:58:59.100]  Why would you give them fluoride?
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:00.760]  Yeah, yeah, just go look.
[01:59:01.161 --> 01:59:02.441]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[01:59:02.541 --> 01:59:17.086]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed, contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[01:59:17.426 --> 01:59:18.646]  0.01, harmful if swallowed.
[01:59:18.786 --> 01:59:19.947]  They put that in the water.
[01:59:19.987 --> 01:59:21.347]  Yeah, that's if you love the kids though.
[01:59:21.367 --> 01:59:23.108]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend your money.
[01:59:23.128 --> 01:59:23.808]  Yeah, you know what, good point.
[01:59:23.828 --> 01:59:25.929]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[01:59:25.949 --> 01:59:26.529]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:33.793]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[01:59:33.813 --> 01:59:38.576]  The War Room.
[01:59:38.696 --> 01:59:41.298]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:50.684]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.138 --> 02:00:00.719]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:07.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.888 --> 02:00:14.052]  All right, the amazing crew was able to find the New York Times article that I talked about.
[02:00:14.072 --> 02:00:22.800]  There's an accompanying video of a similar headline where they show Soros activists in Hungary pulling down the billboards.
[02:00:24.386 --> 02:00:25.747]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:26.287 --> 02:00:26.807]  There they are.
[02:00:26.887 --> 02:00:28.088]  You don't criticize him.
[02:00:28.148 --> 02:00:29.069]  You don't have speech.
[02:00:29.729 --> 02:00:30.930]  And then I've got the newscast.
[02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:32.150]  I'm going to play it at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:39.054]  We're going to start taking your calls now of where they're pulling down signs in Fort Worth that say it's okay to be white.
[02:00:39.675 --> 02:00:42.016]  As the New York Times and others say, it's bad to be white.
[02:00:42.036 --> 02:00:43.577]  So those clips are coming up.
[02:00:43.637 --> 02:00:45.138]  Now I want to go to a lot of your calls.
[02:00:45.258 --> 02:00:52.322]  Abraham and Jeff and LaVonna and Alex and Robert and Kathy and JD and Joshua and Kevin and Matt and Andrew and others.
[02:00:53.823 --> 02:00:57.845]  In fact, out of the gates, I'm told Abraham disagrees with me.
[02:00:58.105 --> 02:00:58.525]  Oh, what?
[02:00:59.106 --> 02:01:00.626]  Soros isn't funding it?
[02:01:01.247 --> 02:01:04.488]  The New York Times said so, but a year ago said he was?
[02:01:04.508 --> 02:01:07.089]  And here's what happens.
[02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:09.390]  They know they're doing all this.
[02:01:11.311 --> 02:01:15.973]  But they play this game in the controlled media where they go, the sky is not blue.
[02:01:16.654 --> 02:01:20.135]  So you debate them that the sky is blue instead of going, you're just a bunch of lying scum.
[02:01:20.175 --> 02:01:21.196]  Get out of my life.
[02:01:23.370 --> 02:01:26.612]  But then you finally say, get out of my life, and they go, we'll take down all other media but us.
[02:01:27.453 --> 02:01:33.977]  And we'll implode your borders and take your pension funds, and then you'll finally worship Alexander Soros.
[02:01:35.338 --> 02:01:38.580]  Oh, then Soros wants to bring in the poor people to help them.
[02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:41.122]  He plunges third world currencies.
[02:01:41.162 --> 02:01:42.943]  He robs pension funds.
[02:01:42.983 --> 02:01:44.304]  He is just a monster.
[02:01:45.905 --> 02:01:48.747]  But he's liberal, so it's okay.
[02:01:50.128 --> 02:01:52.610]  But he represents this whole class of bloodsuckers.
[02:01:53.916 --> 02:01:56.537]  Alright, Abraham Jeff Lovano.
[02:01:57.117 --> 02:01:59.058]  Abraham, I'm told, disagrees.
[02:01:59.238 --> 02:01:59.739]  That's great.
[02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.680]  Tell me about the border crisis.
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:02.840]  Tell me how I'm a bad person.
[02:02:04.741 --> 02:02:05.221]  Can you hear me?
[02:02:06.322 --> 02:02:07.642]  Yep, said I was going to.
[02:02:09.263 --> 02:02:10.504]  Alright, are you able to hear me, Alex?
[02:02:10.944 --> 02:02:11.444]  Yes, I can.
[02:02:11.484 --> 02:02:12.285]  I can really hear you.
[02:02:13.065 --> 02:02:13.505]  Oh, yes.
[02:02:14.286 --> 02:02:21.449]  I somehow disagree with all this decrying by the President, you know, pretty much exclamating violence.
[02:02:22.498 --> 02:02:29.201]  Because Mexico has been helping out a lot to deter all the migrants that are running to Mexico.
[02:02:29.221 --> 02:02:43.748]  I mean, Pompeo just went two weeks ago to speak to the Mexican leaders, and that's the reason why the president, or incoming president of Mexico, he's giving asylum and trying to stop as many migrants to come up here.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:47.581]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:02:47.641 --> 02:02:53.763]  He actually bragged when he was president-elect that part of the UN plan that he was going to help crush our borders and flood the US.
[02:02:54.163 --> 02:02:55.604]  But he's only giving lip service now.
[02:02:57.404 --> 02:02:59.925]  I thought the guy down in Brazil was a Trump-type guy.
[02:02:59.945 --> 02:03:03.747]  I thought the new Mexican president was a socialist.
[02:03:14.974 --> 02:03:20.477]  Mexicans have hope for a change in the country, and this guy, he's been on the front lines for a long time.
[02:03:20.997 --> 02:03:28.961]  He's actually there to help the people of Mexico, so... Well, I guess the collapsing border with Guatemala, I think that'll help you much?
[02:03:30.361 --> 02:03:36.784]  No, we just need to upgrade the whole country's awareness of... You know, how about we just move all of Venezuela to Mexico and not the U.S.?
[02:03:37.104 --> 02:03:38.985]  You think moving Venezuela to you would help?
[02:03:39.925 --> 02:03:43.307]  Well, there's Mexican television that is
[02:03:44.091 --> 02:03:44.831]  It's Ukraine.
[02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:45.611]  That's Soros.
[02:03:45.671 --> 02:03:46.772]  It's in Mexico.
[02:03:47.372 --> 02:03:48.692]  Mexico has been infiltrated.
[02:03:49.352 --> 02:03:51.172]  Well that's exactly what's going on.
[02:03:51.873 --> 02:03:55.033]  Look, these big multinationals are collapsing all our countries.
[02:03:55.333 --> 02:03:56.434]  They're totally exploitive.
[02:03:57.314 --> 02:03:59.074]  And I hope your president is better than what I heard.
[02:03:59.494 --> 02:04:02.415]  He had a bunch of socialist policies, but you never know.
[02:04:02.815 --> 02:04:03.875]  I appreciate your call, Abraham.
[02:04:03.895 --> 02:04:04.295]  God bless.
[02:04:04.335 --> 02:04:05.275]  I was told you disagreed.
[02:04:05.635 --> 02:04:06.876]  Sounds like you just differed a bit.
[02:04:06.896 --> 02:04:07.496]  Then that's fine.
[02:04:07.536 --> 02:04:08.056]  I love to hear it.
[02:04:08.076 --> 02:04:08.576]  God bless you.
[02:04:08.596 --> 02:04:09.296]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:10.516 --> 02:04:12.777]  And I'm not even demonizing all these people that are trying to come up.
[02:04:13.672 --> 02:04:25.121]  But they are handpicked by the UN and vetted and brainwashed, and maybe 5% is women and children who they just hold up as a vanguard to move forward, while they throw rocks at helicopters and attack police.
[02:04:25.141 --> 02:04:26.923]  That in one minute!
[02:04:28.043 --> 02:04:33.648]  And then, I will go to your phone calls, and I will also, on the other side of this quick break,
[02:04:36.172 --> 02:04:36.612]  It too.
[02:04:37.072 --> 02:04:37.573]  That's right.
[02:04:38.533 --> 02:04:39.774]  It's not okay to be white, folks.
[02:04:39.994 --> 02:04:40.414]  I agree.
[02:04:41.194 --> 02:04:42.595]  I agree with Don Lemon of the New York Times.
[02:04:42.715 --> 02:04:43.995]  Whites are inherently evil.
[02:04:44.576 --> 02:04:46.016]  Martin Luther King was wrong.
[02:04:46.697 --> 02:04:48.658]  You don't look at people based on what they stand for and do.
[02:04:49.698 --> 02:04:50.959]  It's all about what color you are.
[02:04:51.199 --> 02:04:51.839]  And whites are bad.
[02:04:53.106 --> 02:04:59.110]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:04:59.490 --> 02:05:02.092]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:02.692 --> 02:05:06.134]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:06.394 --> 02:05:10.657]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:11.097 --> 02:05:14.360]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:25.485]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:26.246 --> 02:05:34.770]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:44.975]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:05:49.837 --> 02:05:50.258]  21st century war.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:05.265]  You're witnessing the attempt to take down the Republic.
[02:06:05.526 --> 02:06:09.534]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:11.137 --> 02:06:13.802]  Folks, we've got some really great news as we go to your phone calls here.
[02:06:15.151 --> 02:06:23.658]  There are evil Americans trying to stop Beto and George Soros who have been caught funding the caravan and the UN and MasterCard funding them.
[02:06:24.258 --> 02:06:30.563]  We have an undercover video that these evil people shot showing the treason, I mean the lovingness of Beto.
[02:06:31.404 --> 02:06:33.225]  What a monster this guy is.
[02:06:33.806 --> 02:06:35.127]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:35.147 --> 02:06:35.947]  Project Veritas.
[02:06:36.268 --> 02:06:37.729]  James O'Keefe almost in the first hour.
[02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:41.392]  Please get it out to everybody you know right now.
[02:06:42.839 --> 02:06:49.221]  And get out to these veto events with signs, you name it, exposing the fact that he's done this.
[02:06:49.341 --> 02:06:50.022]  It is incredible.
[02:06:50.042 --> 02:06:56.084]  And then you've got the New York Times, the Washington Post, Michael Moore, I haven't even played the clip yet, saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:06:56.644 --> 02:06:59.245]  This is the nastiness of these people.
[02:07:00.525 --> 02:07:01.786]  Let's play Michael Moore first.
[02:07:02.725 --> 02:07:07.067]  Going on the nightly news shows, the nightly comedy shows, spewing this crap.
[02:07:07.808 --> 02:07:12.891]  No, they know that immigrants, either legal or illegal, don't like communism or socialism.
[02:07:14.451 --> 02:07:15.632]  They know the free market works.
[02:07:15.892 --> 02:07:17.433]  They don't want to be on welfare on average.
[02:07:17.893 --> 02:07:19.634]  So they're going to go with race-based class warfare.
[02:07:21.415 --> 02:07:25.758]  And you look at the New York Times and all of them saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:07:26.618 --> 02:07:28.039]  This is just outrageous.
[02:07:28.099 --> 02:07:29.680]  It's so clear what they're doing.
[02:07:31.067 --> 02:07:44.153]  But then meanwhile somebody puts up it's okay to be white and proud virtue signaling people in Fort Worth go pull it down when it's a counter to what the leftists are doing, inherently saying whites are bad.
[02:07:44.553 --> 02:07:49.216]  If people were saying blacks were inherently bad, it'd be okay to say blacks are okay.
[02:07:49.336 --> 02:07:50.216]  It's okay to be human.
[02:07:51.297 --> 02:07:52.477]  But see, you can't do that.
[02:07:52.597 --> 02:07:54.178]  Think about how crazy that is.
[02:07:54.558 --> 02:07:56.079]  Like, it's okay to be Jewish.
[02:07:57.318 --> 02:07:58.278]  It's okay to be black.
[02:07:58.378 --> 02:07:59.939]  It's okay to be Islamic.
[02:08:00.019 --> 02:08:04.181]  But don't say it's okay to be white, because Michael Moore will get upset.
[02:08:04.221 --> 02:08:04.621]  Here he is.
[02:08:05.402 --> 02:08:10.844]  But they are fanatical about this, because they know their time is up.
[02:08:11.144 --> 02:08:16.407]  And he's sort of the angry white guy, which actually I'm really Trump's demographic.
[02:08:16.587 --> 02:08:18.628]  Yeah, you're a Michigan angry white guy.
[02:08:18.648 --> 02:08:21.469]  I'm an angry white guy, over 50, with a high school education.
[02:08:22.129 --> 02:08:22.930]  So that's me.
[02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:31.916]  So if I couldn't speak to my fellow angry white American guys who are semi-uneducated like me... Dudes!
[02:08:32.536 --> 02:08:34.077]  Give it up!
[02:08:34.557 --> 02:08:38.240]  We've been running the show for 10,000 years!
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:39.421]  It's like...
[02:08:40.101 --> 02:08:51.011]  It's like, we've had a long run as men, running everything, and the Yankees could never win as many pennants as we've won in these 10,000 years as men.
[02:08:51.451 --> 02:08:53.213]  So, why don't we just take a break?
[02:08:54.013 --> 02:08:56.636]  Let the majority gender run the show.
[02:08:56.896 --> 02:08:59.378]  Just to see how it would go.
[02:08:59.418 --> 02:09:00.519]  What are you scared of?
[02:09:02.941 --> 02:09:05.544]  So, I've never seen such pandering in my life.
[02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:12.336]  That's the whole Hillary line, that women are going to empower things, as if men and women are different, and that we're not together.
[02:09:12.756 --> 02:09:21.924]  And that, just open your borders up to Islam, where women are slaves, and then this idea that white people have been running the show for 10,000 years?
[02:09:22.084 --> 02:09:22.584]  Excuse me?
[02:09:24.546 --> 02:09:32.773]  I mean, up until about 500 years ago, Africa was running Africa, Asia was running Asia, and a few empires were running white people, and it was all diverse groups.
[02:09:33.153 --> 02:09:35.115]  Just the way they dumb this down,
[02:09:36.772 --> 02:09:40.813]  And the way they push this agenda is so countervailing reality.
[02:09:41.973 --> 02:09:43.713]  And then as if whites are bad.
[02:09:44.073 --> 02:09:47.214]  Why is everybody trying to get into the white areas, then, if Europeans are so bad?
[02:09:50.095 --> 02:09:52.755]  Again, and... Oh, give it up!
[02:09:53.135 --> 02:09:54.335]  Venezuela just collapsed!
[02:09:55.236 --> 02:09:58.536]  And they're coming this way, so let's let them run things!
[02:09:59.616 --> 02:10:01.237]  Yeah, get on welfare... No.
[02:10:01.877 --> 02:10:02.297]  Here's the key.
[02:10:04.352 --> 02:10:05.113]  Jeff Bezos.
[02:10:06.294 --> 02:10:06.935]  Zuckerberg.
[02:10:07.916 --> 02:10:08.536]  Eric Schmidt.
[02:10:11.139 --> 02:10:11.860]  Jack Dorsey.
[02:10:13.442 --> 02:10:14.243]  George Soros.
[02:10:15.504 --> 02:10:18.367]  All these billionaires like Oprah Winfrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:10:18.787 --> 02:10:19.308]  He's a billionaire.
[02:10:21.371 --> 02:10:23.871]  It's good to have open borders, yeah, I like it.
[02:10:23.992 --> 02:10:25.892]  I wear Hitler belt too.
[02:10:26.692 --> 02:10:36.794]  They're just using race-based politics, because if you think third world populations are more altruistic and higher and mightier than Christian Europeans, boy, you're in for a grave mistake.
[02:10:37.254 --> 02:10:40.975]  They can't get their act together killing each other, and they're coming up here like locusts.
[02:10:45.455 --> 02:10:48.216]  And they're going to be organized by George Soros and company.
[02:10:49.974 --> 02:10:51.395]  Who said this is the plan to conquer.
[02:10:52.195 --> 02:10:54.557]  But you got another late night host looking at Michael Moore.
[02:10:55.037 --> 02:10:56.999]  Yeah, let's give women a chance to run things.
[02:10:57.079 --> 02:10:58.760]  As if women haven't been running things for a minute.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.280]  We're humans.
[02:11:00.261 --> 02:11:00.841]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:11:01.321 --> 02:11:04.884]  No, it's big mega banks and big tech companies that are tax exempt.
[02:11:05.464 --> 02:11:18.253]  Mainly a bunch of old evil white men with a bunch of evil Chinese men who suppress their own people, who are organizing third world populations to use the fact that we have voting to bring them in, make them dependent, have them vote to destroy their future!
[02:11:19.053 --> 02:11:24.037]  Michael Moore doesn't say, let's give the Chinese communists, almost all males, running slave factories.
[02:11:24.277 --> 02:11:26.819]  Let's leave your women and your peasants a chance to run things.
[02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:28.220]  Which would be a good idea, actually.
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:29.260]  No!
[02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:32.243]  Oh no, he doesn't talk about people that killed five times what Hitler did.
[02:11:32.483 --> 02:11:36.266]  It's all about America's bad, and you need to roll over and have race bases.
[02:11:36.306 --> 02:11:42.290]  This guy's giving you a Hitler lesson in how race-based systems are good and whites are bad.
[02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:46.333]  It's all going on in front of you like you're an idiot.
[02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:50.011]  What a monstrous pig!
[02:11:51.872 --> 02:11:53.673]  Huge article, Infowars.com.
[02:11:56.834 --> 02:11:59.816]  It's okay to be white signs pop up in Fort Worth neighborhood.
[02:12:00.056 --> 02:12:04.138]  Origin of the signs and the intended meaning of the words a mystery.
[02:12:04.858 --> 02:12:05.699]  Laugh out loud.
[02:12:05.739 --> 02:12:07.860]  No, you're saying whites are bad.
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.921]  All, I mean, hundreds of articles a day.
[02:12:09.981 --> 02:12:11.242]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:12:11.622 --> 02:12:12.542]  The white problem.
[02:12:12.682 --> 02:12:13.143]  Opinion.
[02:12:13.183 --> 02:12:14.143]  Can we replace them?
[02:12:14.463 --> 02:12:15.144]  New York Times.
[02:12:16.957 --> 02:12:19.158]  Bill Kristol, lazy white working class, the problem.
[02:12:19.178 --> 02:12:19.898]  We need to replace him.
[02:12:19.938 --> 02:12:22.838]  New York Times, replacing white people, the key.
[02:12:23.859 --> 02:12:26.940]  And don't worry, this old white lady, she watches TV all day.
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:28.600]  How can I cure my white guilt?
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.800]  Get rid of whites, New York Times.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.821]  People are like, hey, it's okay to be white.
[02:12:32.181 --> 02:12:35.682]  Imagine if there was, everywhere on TV, it's blacks are inherently evil, they're inherently bad.
[02:12:35.922 --> 02:12:39.263]  I'd be like, it's okay to be black, but you don't say it about white.
[02:12:40.343 --> 02:12:44.444]  We ought to do a test where we hang up signs that say it's okay to be Jewish, it's okay to be white.
[02:12:45.595 --> 02:12:46.456]  It's okay to be black.
[02:12:47.437 --> 02:12:48.498]  And it's okay to be Muslim.
[02:12:49.719 --> 02:12:50.580]  It's okay to be Buddhist.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.762]  And I guarantee you, we have vans and hidden cameras.
[02:12:52.922 --> 02:12:53.523]  We're gonna do this.
[02:12:54.304 --> 02:13:02.932]  Man, the white people are gonna come out and they're gonna just go, pull on the white ones and then run over to the black ones and go, because this is about cuckolding.
[02:13:03.452 --> 02:13:05.735]  Here is the CBS News report that's on Infowars.com.
[02:13:07.011 --> 02:13:13.853]  Homeowners in one North Fort Worth neighborhood woke up to an unsettling sight, and now they can't figure out if it was a prank or something more.
[02:13:13.873 --> 02:13:15.253]  Kim Olsen has joined us.
[02:13:15.313 --> 02:13:17.393]  At the very least, this thing, Ken, I saw the signs.
[02:13:17.733 --> 02:13:18.353]  It's concerning.
[02:13:19.014 --> 02:13:19.654]  I saw them.
[02:13:19.714 --> 02:13:22.954]  They're wondering why, you know, and exactly what was the intention.
[02:13:22.975 --> 02:13:23.655]  I saw them.
[02:13:23.675 --> 02:13:25.195]  The neighborhood seemed to have been tagged.
[02:13:25.555 --> 02:13:32.317]  To cause a debate that you people are an anti-white cult, and we've all just accepted this super-Hitlerian, anti-Martin Luther King garbage?
[02:13:32.597 --> 02:13:33.317]  Here, let's play it again.
[02:13:33.337 --> 02:13:34.077]  This is so insane.
[02:13:34.837 --> 02:13:37.759]  People woke up to something really unsettling today, okay?
[02:13:40.121 --> 02:13:46.125]  Every newspaper says whites are inherently evil and it's above Hitler, but somebody did it, why did they do it?
[02:13:46.145 --> 02:13:48.707]  To show what a cult you people are!
[02:13:49.147 --> 02:13:51.449]  How you corporate media regurgitate this crap!
[02:13:51.469 --> 02:13:51.929]  Here it is!
[02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:59.274]  Owners in one north Fort Worth neighborhood woke up to an unsettling sight and now they can't figure out if it was a prank or something more.
[02:13:59.394 --> 02:14:00.475]  Ken Molestina is joining us.
[02:14:00.755 --> 02:14:02.836]  At the very least, this thing, Ken, I saw the signs.
[02:14:03.176 --> 02:14:05.157]  It's concerning, at the least.
[02:14:05.197 --> 02:14:09.100]  They're wondering why, you know, and exactly what was the intention in all of this.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.002]  The neighborhood seemed to have been tagged with handfuls of signs printed on paper.
[02:14:13.042 --> 02:14:16.044]  Those signs read, it's okay to be white.
[02:14:16.084 --> 02:14:17.305]  That's what was printed on them.
[02:14:17.325 --> 02:14:18.906]  But no one knows who put them up.
[02:14:19.997 --> 02:14:20.938]  Somebody tell Don Lemon.
[02:14:20.978 --> 02:14:24.961]  Here's what it looked like along Waverly Lane in North Fort Worth early Thursday morning.
[02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:32.987]  Cell phone video and pictures taken of the area show the signs reading, it's okay to be white, posted onto lampposts and other pieces of public property.
[02:14:33.307 --> 02:14:38.951]  By the time we got there, all of the signs except for this one were gone, but it didn't stay up too much longer.
[02:14:38.971 --> 02:14:39.452]  Oh, good.
[02:14:39.472 --> 02:14:43.295]  Lemon Bob is white and is all that you're going to get in this neighborhood.
[02:14:44.429 --> 02:14:45.030]  Yay!
[02:14:45.110 --> 02:14:45.892]  Get rid of free speech!
[02:14:45.912 --> 02:14:46.132]  Yay!
[02:14:52.034 --> 02:14:53.655]  And I don't care what color you are.
[02:14:54.256 --> 02:14:55.957]  I don't care what religion you are.
[02:14:55.997 --> 02:14:57.258]  But it's not okay to be white.
[02:14:57.358 --> 02:14:59.700]  I don't care what your economic status is.
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:02.442]  You judge people by how they act.
[02:15:02.943 --> 02:15:07.726]  What no one seems to be able to answer is who put them up and what exactly was the intention of the message.
[02:15:07.746 --> 02:15:08.687]  Martin Luther King said that.
[02:15:08.707 --> 02:15:09.548]  That's how brainwashed she is.
[02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:14.271]  She pulls them down because, lady, everywhere the corporate media is saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:15:14.572 --> 02:15:19.996]  It's literally Hitler stuff upside down run by the New York Times and Carlos Slim.
[02:15:21.343 --> 02:15:24.025]  So that we all hate ourselves, and then, okay, overrun me!
[02:15:24.085 --> 02:15:24.505]  I'm your slave!
[02:15:24.705 --> 02:15:25.126]  I'm white!
[02:15:25.146 --> 02:15:27.327]  It's like Thulsa Doom says, come to me, my child.
[02:15:28.288 --> 02:15:28.748]  You're white!
[02:15:28.768 --> 02:15:29.809]  And I'm like, oh my gosh!
[02:15:30.449 --> 02:15:30.909]  I'm sorry!
[02:15:30.929 --> 02:15:32.210]  Whatever you say, everything's yours!
[02:15:33.491 --> 02:15:35.272]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[02:15:35.312 --> 02:15:35.693]  That's it!
[02:15:36.153 --> 02:15:36.993]  I've been busy, I've done it.
[02:15:37.114 --> 02:15:39.295]  I'm festooning everywhere, on video.
[02:15:39.555 --> 02:15:40.696]  But it's okay to be white science.
[02:15:40.936 --> 02:15:42.317]  And I'm doing it today!
[02:15:43.017 --> 02:15:43.978]  I'm going crazy!
[02:15:44.739 --> 02:15:45.399]  Everyone do it!
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.581]  God almighty, this is insane!
[02:15:49.322 --> 02:15:51.103]  Meanwhile, Oprah Winfrey wants to exterminate black people.
[02:15:58.303 --> 02:16:02.407]  I personally buy high-quality, storable food every decade or so.
[02:16:02.427 --> 02:16:11.395]  And even though the best quality food that we sell at InfoWareStore.com lasts more than 25 years, every 10 years or so, I give it away to the homeless and know they're getting high-quality food.
[02:16:12.739 --> 02:16:17.803]  But the reason I do that is because I know we could have a nuclear war, we could have an asteroid hit, an earthquake.
[02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:24.348]  It's normal for everything above grasshoppers, ants up to humans, to take care of yourself, to not count on FEMA.
[02:16:24.849 --> 02:16:36.278]  President Trump's great, but you see things like Hurricane Michael devastating the coastline, like a nuclear bomb went off, and you learn the government takes weeks or months, or in the case of Puerto Rico, over a year to get all the power back on.
[02:16:37.449 --> 02:16:38.650]  And that's because they're not God.
[02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:39.971]  They can't fix everything.
[02:16:40.331 --> 02:16:42.292]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:16:42.692 --> 02:16:45.114]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they can't food.
[02:16:45.794 --> 02:16:47.355]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:16:48.716 --> 02:16:51.378]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:16:51.658 --> 02:16:58.582]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top, most respected companies out there.
[02:16:58.662 --> 02:17:06.087]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:17:07.219 --> 02:17:08.680]  There's been some big fights over this.
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:20.484]  In fact, it's been a couple years since I was able to actually offer you 35% off the already discounted price we have, where there's even very little profit for us or for my Patriot.
[02:17:20.504 --> 02:17:25.366]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:17:25.867 --> 02:17:27.787]  We have those incredible sale prices back.
[02:17:28.127 --> 02:17:31.269]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[02:17:31.949 --> 02:17:33.390]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:17:33.430 --> 02:17:37.873]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:17:38.133 --> 02:17:40.114]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:17:40.694 --> 02:17:43.176]  Bottom line, you support the M4 with the products.
[02:17:43.516 --> 02:17:44.317]  You put it in your attic.
[02:17:44.357 --> 02:17:45.277]  You put it in your garage.
[02:17:45.637 --> 02:17:46.938]  You take it with you when you go camping.
[02:17:46.978 --> 02:17:57.705]  But you always know if something bad happens, a hurricane, an earthquake, a tornado, whatever the case is, or maybe you lose your job, God forbid, you've got that three-month, that six-month, that year supply.
[02:17:57.945 --> 02:17:59.125]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:17:59.526 --> 02:18:01.047]  If stuff happens, you could feed your whole block.
[02:18:01.767 --> 02:18:11.371]  We've also got great air filtration and water filtration produced by the very same people, Alexa Pure Breeze, Alexa Pure Water Filtration, are the same folks that bring you my Patriot Supply.
[02:18:11.711 --> 02:18:18.874]  They only started about 10 years ago, but within a few years, they were one of the dominant companies, the top three, because of quality and great service and low prices.
[02:18:19.474 --> 02:18:25.597]  InfoWarsTore.com has their full spectrum, the lowest price you'll find it anywhere, under the name InfoWars Select.
[02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:28.438]  We also have the full Patriot Supply catalog there as well.
[02:18:28.458 --> 02:18:29.439]  But whatever you do,
[02:18:30.359 --> 02:18:50.736]  Realize that almost metaphysically, well not even almost, when we become self-sufficient at carpentry, or at farming, or at marksmanship, or at hand-to-hand combat, or at communication, or at web mastering, whatever it is, or being an electrician, a blacksmith, a gunsmith, when we learn these tools it activates parts of our minds and empowers us.
[02:18:51.136 --> 02:18:54.899]  And when you have the self-defense implements, the water filtration,
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:55.960]  We're good
[02:19:14.838 --> 02:19:19.605]  To restore the Republic and empower free market systems and defend Christianity and so much more.
[02:19:20.306 --> 02:19:25.013]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:19:25.314 --> 02:19:27.517]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsSelect.
[02:19:27.817 --> 02:19:30.682]  High quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:19:56.022 --> 02:20:07.129]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.149 --> 02:20:12.272]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.932 --> 02:20:14.113]  Alex Baldwin!
[02:20:15.254 --> 02:20:17.136]  You would be very useful to me.
[02:20:18.857 --> 02:20:20.778]  I just heard Alec Baldwin got arrested.
[02:20:21.759 --> 02:20:25.582]  And I asked, and I wasn't surprised why, fighting over a parking space.
[02:20:26.442 --> 02:20:34.609]  Well, I'm sure the 600 million illegals the UN officially wants to bring in in the next 20 years will make it easier for you to find parking spots there, buddy.
[02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:37.950]  Hilarious!
[02:20:37.970 --> 02:20:38.810]  Let's get serious though.
[02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:41.273]  Well, right back to your calls, but I haven't finished this video.
[02:20:41.773 --> 02:20:49.441]  The real grand finale in Fort Worth is... Fort Worthians woke up this morning to terrible, horrible Nazi evil.
[02:20:49.942 --> 02:20:51.623]  That white people are okay.
[02:20:52.384 --> 02:20:54.967]  Even though it's in the New York Times, I just showed you that we're inherently evil.
[02:20:54.987 --> 02:20:55.947]  We're the worst thing on earth.
[02:20:56.308 --> 02:20:58.090]  Michael Moore, we just go away and die.
[02:20:58.970 --> 02:21:01.253]  Oprah Winfrey, just old white people just die.
[02:21:02.503 --> 02:21:05.046]  Die, die, die, my darling.
[02:21:05.486 --> 02:21:07.468]  Don't say a single word.
[02:21:08.769 --> 02:21:11.112]  And so here's the grand finale of that, and we'll go back to your calls.
[02:21:11.612 --> 02:21:22.584]  Here is the leftist race-baiting orgy with a bunch of virtue-signaling white people falling over themselves to fall off a rhetorical cliff.
[02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:26.640]  District 4 Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:35.974]  I condemn any type of literature, sign that is posted, that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:21:38.419 --> 02:22:06.847]  I'm against any literature, posting, you just, if somebody finds it offensive, well I find your big ol' ugly cracker head, and that stupid ass UT Longhorn thing you've got on your shirt, another butt-kissing establishment wannabe Texan, you probably just got her like 10 years ago, but you go, I'm a big ol' tough Texan over here, I don't like nothing that people don't like, so if anybody don't like it, I'm offended.
[02:22:08.302 --> 02:22:09.942]  By that Bevo on your shirt.
[02:22:11.163 --> 02:22:11.763]  I'm not really.
[02:22:12.143 --> 02:22:16.004]  My family all went to UT, but the point is, I'm offended by that!
[02:22:17.004 --> 02:22:17.824]  That taken off!
[02:22:19.125 --> 02:22:21.025]  Like a white kid in a Black Panther outfit.
[02:22:21.305 --> 02:22:23.346]  One person was offended, they got rid of it!
[02:22:24.666 --> 02:22:25.906]  That was Mark Dyson, it was a joke.
[02:22:26.166 --> 02:22:27.307]  You people are sick!
[02:22:27.947 --> 02:22:28.767]  God Almighty!
[02:22:31.328 --> 02:22:32.469]  Let's hear from him again.
[02:22:32.509 --> 02:22:34.330]  Go ahead.
[02:22:34.430 --> 02:22:37.391]  District 4 Councilman Cary Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:22:37.411 --> 02:22:42.874]  That could be any type of literature sign that... Hey, start over again.
[02:22:43.254 --> 02:22:45.875]  Cary Moon's not taking it lightly.
[02:22:45.895 --> 02:22:58.602]  Now, they're in every publication in the country saying white people are inherently evil, and it's a bunch of weird commie professors doing it, who almost every one of them is a gut-flexing fat-ass white dude.
[02:23:00.472 --> 02:23:03.614]  With a ding-dong you can't find with magnifying glass.
[02:23:04.355 --> 02:23:09.959]  But because they told everybody what's real, people are starting to say, stop saying that.
[02:23:10.419 --> 02:23:11.540]  Well, I don't like it.
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.382]  And I ain't taking it down lightly.
[02:23:14.402 --> 02:23:19.345]  I'd love to walk into that guy's office and say, what frickin' planet do you live on, you idiot?
[02:23:19.805 --> 02:23:24.789]  That if anybody's offended by anything, I don't take it lightly.
[02:23:25.913 --> 02:23:27.414]  Well, let me tell you something, boy.
[02:23:27.875 --> 02:23:29.436]  I don't take people like you lightly!
[02:23:29.616 --> 02:23:31.938]  You're crapping all over our country, you piece of crap!
[02:23:33.159 --> 02:23:33.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:34.961 --> 02:23:37.383]  And I really don't like fake Texas Tuk-Tuv.
[02:23:41.727 --> 02:23:41.967]  Sorry.
[02:23:42.868 --> 02:23:43.929]  The election's gotten a little bit fired up.
[02:23:44.489 --> 02:23:45.270]  Control ourselves.
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:48.192]  We don't want to fully transform.
[02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:49.353]  Let's go back to him.
[02:23:49.393 --> 02:23:49.714]  Here he is.
[02:23:51.326 --> 02:23:54.267]  District 4 Councilman Cary Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:23:54.287 --> 02:24:03.610]  I condemn any type of literature sign that is posted that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:14.953]  All of this comes on the heels of a recent report sent to council members about anti-immigrant activity in other parts of the city involving, quote, the placement of defamatory banners and flyers on public property.
[02:24:15.353 --> 02:24:16.474]  There's just not a place for this.
[02:24:17.734 --> 02:24:20.015]  Yeah, America's not a place for free speech.
[02:24:20.415 --> 02:24:29.699]  Fort Worth probably shipped in 500,000 illegal aliens the last few years, and they're all over the place, sleeping in your backyard and crapping on your front porch.
[02:24:30.399 --> 02:24:34.901]  And some people in America believe you can say something about that.
[02:24:35.441 --> 02:24:37.082]  We ain't gonna stand for it.
[02:24:37.922 --> 02:24:41.443]  And we're really glad there's censoring everybody.
[02:24:41.463 --> 02:24:44.725]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:24:44.745 --> 02:24:45.265]  I'm out of control.
[02:24:46.138 --> 02:24:49.460]  But just, this guy is the most triggering babbling butt I've ever seen.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:50.160]  Let's go back to him.
[02:24:52.021 --> 02:24:57.923]  Well the councilman said this kind of activity is considered a class C misdemeanor and those responsible could face a citation.
[02:24:58.264 --> 02:25:07.728]  He also said instead of ripping the signs down, neighbors should call police immediately and leave those signs up since they are considered to be evidence and then just let the police investigate the situation.
[02:25:08.342 --> 02:25:09.583]  I think I'm gonna call the police on myself.
[02:25:09.983 --> 02:25:11.044]  Yes, 9-1-1.
[02:25:11.984 --> 02:25:15.767]  You never arrest anybody else putting up stuff for rock bands or for, you know...
[02:25:17.403 --> 02:25:22.245]  Whatever the case may be, maybe a garage sale, maybe a lemonade stand.
[02:25:22.846 --> 02:25:32.570]  But you know, if somebody has political speech that's the most protected, well we gotta shut that down right now.
[02:25:33.330 --> 02:25:35.191]  As long as we talk like this.
[02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:40.814]  There's just a lot of people that want to act like they're from the South or Texas where they do it more and more like a virtue signal.
[02:25:40.834 --> 02:25:42.995]  So it's like, hang on, Dale.
[02:25:44.416 --> 02:25:48.059]  I think I'm gonna go to, that's it, I'm going to Fort Worth.
[02:25:48.099 --> 02:25:48.619]  I can't help it.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:49.560]  I gotta do it.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:50.401]  I gotta do it myself there.
[02:25:50.801 --> 02:25:52.102]  I gotta see this guy.
[02:25:52.302 --> 02:25:55.024]  I mean this guy is a, oh my god.
[02:25:55.625 --> 02:25:56.025]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:57.886 --> 02:26:01.209]  This, finish it and I promise I'm going to your calls after the break.
[02:26:01.249 --> 02:26:02.470]  I swear I'm a bad person.
[02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:04.071]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:26:04.111 --> 02:26:04.952]  Just please go to it.
[02:26:06.786 --> 02:26:08.947]  Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:26:09.267 --> 02:26:18.292]  I condemn any type of literature, sign that is posted, that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:26:18.833 --> 02:26:29.619]  All of this comes on the heels of a recent report sent to council members about anti-immigrant activity in other parts of the city involving, quote, the placement of defamatory banners and flyers on public property.
[02:26:30.039 --> 02:26:34.982]  There's just not a place for this in Fort Worth, and it's not indicative of the true forest spirit.
[02:26:36.095 --> 02:26:41.996]  Well, the councilman said this kind of activity is considered a Class C misdemeanor and those responsible could face a citation.
[02:26:42.336 --> 02:26:51.259]  He also said instead of ripping the signs down, neighbors should call police immediately and leave those signs up since they are considered to be evidence and then just let the police investigate.
[02:26:51.299 --> 02:27:01.221]  Yeah, when you get a couple hundred thousand people attacking police with kidnapped kids, running around screaming, we're criminals, we're gonna kill cops when we get there, funded by international groups, you just let them all go.
[02:27:02.557 --> 02:27:08.139]  But if somebody tried Texas to put up a sign, you call police.
[02:27:11.059 --> 02:27:15.241]  Just like Europe, where for 10 years, you bitch about your daughter being raped, you get arrested.
[02:27:15.681 --> 02:27:17.941]  You fight somebody trying to rape your wife, you go to jail.
[02:27:18.181 --> 02:27:18.562]  Let me hear you.
[02:27:18.762 --> 02:27:21.462]  Let's just pull this sign down right here.
[02:27:21.802 --> 02:27:22.703]  What the hell?
[02:27:22.743 --> 02:27:24.723]  You think this is America?
[02:27:25.183 --> 02:27:27.744]  White people are not okay.
[02:27:28.204 --> 02:27:30.305]  Is that clear, boy?
[02:27:32.128 --> 02:27:34.169]  Look at her, she'll show your ass.
[02:27:34.529 --> 02:27:37.290]  I guess she kind of gets that gunslinger stance after she pulls it down.
[02:27:37.770 --> 02:27:39.430]  She can't really, she's like, yeah, why?
[02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:41.111]  I'm a good person.
[02:27:41.611 --> 02:27:46.072]  First Amendment, wipe my big old butt with that right now.
[02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:50.234]  God, we're screwed.
[02:27:55.501 --> 02:27:56.462]  I hadn't seen this.
[02:27:56.522 --> 02:27:58.604]  I saw the Drudge Link this morning and didn't click it.
[02:27:58.624 --> 02:27:59.425]  I didn't have time.
[02:27:59.445 --> 02:28:02.167]  I was dealing with the kid stuff.
[02:28:02.688 --> 02:28:04.349]  He told me I have to play it.
[02:28:04.469 --> 02:28:07.332]  It's the most insane crap I've had.
[02:28:07.392 --> 02:28:08.413]  These people.
[02:28:09.333 --> 02:28:10.114]  Oh my god.
[02:28:10.234 --> 02:28:12.316]  I think they may conquer Texas.
[02:28:12.937 --> 02:28:13.877]  I just, I don't know.
[02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:16.240]  But it's fine to let everybody go to hell.
[02:28:17.501 --> 02:28:19.723]  At a certain point, good lord.
[02:28:30.279 --> 02:28:32.360]  Call the police immediately!
[02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:37.083]  We got people exercising free speech around here against the rape gangs.
[02:28:38.283 --> 02:28:39.664]  We ain't gonna put up with that.
[02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:42.766]  All right, I'm a bad person, but I'll go to your calls.
[02:28:43.306 --> 02:28:49.949]  If the hair lips the Admiral and the water don't rise over Bear Creek straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:28:52.651 --> 02:28:58.454]  What I'm about to break down is so simple and so apparent, so prima facie,
[02:29:00.916 --> 02:29:05.503]  That I almost don't want to play 2001 Space Odyssey music to build it up.
[02:29:05.624 --> 02:29:06.024]  You know what?
[02:29:06.986 --> 02:29:08.989]  Simplicity and truth deserves it.
[02:29:10.114 --> 02:29:17.961]  Introducing Survival Shield X3, iodine in an energized quantum state, or an atomic state.
[02:29:18.301 --> 02:29:20.523]  That doesn't mean radioactive, it means elemental.
[02:29:21.144 --> 02:29:32.533]  All three forms, including deep earth crystal iodine, two other forms with a tiny amount of vitamin C, to stop it from oxidizing and keep it in that state of true purity.
[02:29:33.074 --> 02:29:37.738]  So that when it hits your cells, when it goes into your body, it has the amazing effect.
[02:29:38.888 --> 02:29:40.869]  We all need oxygen to live on this planet.
[02:29:40.889 --> 02:29:42.769]  We all need water to live.
[02:29:42.789 --> 02:29:43.470]  We all need food.
[02:29:44.290 --> 02:29:52.833]  But there are other key building blocks, other key elements, that if we don't have them, well, we got a big problem.
[02:29:53.873 --> 02:29:58.554]  And Survival Shield X3 is the next level of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:59.035 --> 02:30:05.937]  And what we've been able to develop and come up with takes the game-changing, trailblazing,
[02:30:07.570 --> 02:30:11.813]  Things that we witnessed with X2, and it takes it to a whole other level.
[02:30:11.994 --> 02:30:23.442]  We have a two ounce bottles, we have a one ounce bottles, and this is the best thing of scientists, chemists, researchers, to come up with a formula that is beyond true iodine.
[02:30:23.482 --> 02:30:27.185]  It is all forms of it, energized,
[02:30:28.428 --> 02:30:30.751]  Active and ready to energize the body.
[02:30:31.231 --> 02:30:35.977]  The iodine in X3 comes from thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:30:36.938 --> 02:30:44.666]  Hidden from the oxidation and radiation and toxins that are on the surface for tens of thousands of years.
[02:30:45.788 --> 02:30:53.738]  X3, ladies and gentlemen, is the, from our research, ultimate form of true atomic iodine.
[02:30:54.119 --> 02:31:00.468]  Fused with other forms of iodine and vitamin C to keep it in its energetic state.
[02:31:01.758 --> 02:31:08.983]  Look, I've got piles of papers and research and scientists I've been talking to for years, and to try to put it all in just a few minutes is impossible.
[02:31:09.523 --> 02:31:10.463]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:31:11.064 --> 02:31:14.386]  The globalists are pumping our environment full of bad halogens.
[02:31:14.546 --> 02:31:15.607]  Fluoride is just part of that.
[02:31:17.708 --> 02:31:22.411]  Iodine is the good halogen that the human body absolutely has to have to operate.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:26.763]  And they have done everything they can to take that out of the environment.
[02:31:27.243 --> 02:31:33.630]  So our quest to bring people the very best supplements, the very best nutraceuticals, it was clear that iodine was critical.
[02:31:34.611 --> 02:31:38.634]  And we've gone through several permutations and our research just gets better and better and better.
[02:31:38.915 --> 02:31:41.097]  And every time you reformulate, you give it a new name.
[02:31:41.757 --> 02:31:43.940]  Well, X3 is a quantum leap.
[02:31:45.345 --> 02:31:47.006]  From X1 and X2.
[02:31:47.686 --> 02:31:48.967]  And it's simply incredible.
[02:31:49.648 --> 02:31:51.889]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:57.372]  I want you to go research it, look at the facts for yourself, but it is amazing.
[02:31:58.173 --> 02:32:05.077]  And what it's done for my stamina, my focus, my libido, everything is just incredible.
[02:32:05.097 --> 02:32:06.018]  And then I realized why.
[02:32:06.778 --> 02:32:16.151]  The globalists have wanted to get it out of the food and out of the water and out of the food chain for 50, 60 years because iodine, for me, is like oxygen.
[02:32:18.152 --> 02:32:18.972]  It energizes.
[02:32:19.712 --> 02:32:20.592]  It gives life.
[02:32:21.113 --> 02:32:21.633]  It's everything.
[02:32:22.253 --> 02:32:32.374]  In your quest to have a better life for you, your family, your children, your wife, your husband, your co-workers, the military, the police, you need to take care of yourselves, and iodine is the missing link.
[02:32:32.695 --> 02:32:32.975]  It's X3.
[02:32:32.995 --> 02:32:35.275]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:32:35.875 --> 02:32:44.357]  In 2-ounce and 1-ounce, it's 50% off out of the gates and free shipping as our newest special at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:44.597 --> 02:32:46.317]  I want you to experience.
[02:32:47.077 --> 02:32:52.000]  This critical element that you're supposed to have for yourself.
[02:32:56.042 --> 02:32:58.784]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:10.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:10.771 --> 02:33:12.092]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.387 --> 02:33:27.448]  Alright, I'm going right to your calls now and I really appreciate everybody holding.
[02:33:27.468 --> 02:33:31.830]  I'll go a little bit in the next hour to take some time away from the great Joel Gilbert so I get to all of you.
[02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:34.851]  But, this is very cut and dry.
[02:33:35.872 --> 02:33:47.777]  Our Christian open society that Europe and the United States ended slavery worldwide except for some areas of Islam, which the left totally ignores, and communist China.
[02:33:48.177 --> 02:33:50.178]  And then they sit there and tell us how we're bad all day.
[02:33:50.198 --> 02:33:53.280]  They have all these weird virtues signaling white people.
[02:33:54.887 --> 02:33:58.148]  Strutting around on television, it's like Monty Python comedy.
[02:33:58.949 --> 02:34:00.129]  This is super dangerous.
[02:34:00.149 --> 02:34:01.070]  This is super bad.
[02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:02.330]  These people are out of control.
[02:34:04.151 --> 02:34:06.872]  Now, tomorrow, 3 p.m.
[02:34:06.972 --> 02:34:20.478]  Central, and probably earlier if the false flag or something goes off, we've got people live on the border that are going to be Skyping in, and I'm not going to announce for intel reasons and security reasons where or why, but you'll want to tune in tomorrow, 3 p.m.
[02:34:20.498 --> 02:34:20.818]  Central.
[02:34:21.919 --> 02:34:24.020]  And you could better bet your bottom dollar
[02:34:24.909 --> 02:34:26.070]  You can bet your boots.
[02:34:27.532 --> 02:34:28.413]  You can bet your horse.
[02:34:30.375 --> 02:34:39.944]  You can bet your horse, your boots, your last dollar, and my right arm, that if I can get on air at midnight tonight, if something happens, I'll be down here.
[02:34:40.945 --> 02:34:44.409]  And you can bet, if something goes off, God forbid, in the morning, I'll be here.
[02:34:44.689 --> 02:34:47.772]  Just watch Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:34:49.653 --> 02:34:55.978]  I'll be here by three tomorrow to go for five, six hours live with a bunch of big guests who've already got lined up and stuff I'm not going to get into on air yet.
[02:34:56.038 --> 02:34:57.320]  So let's go write your phone calls right now.
[02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:59.421]  And then Sunday, the regular four to 6 p.m.
[02:35:00.042 --> 02:35:02.264]  And then we're going to go from 8 a.m.
[02:35:02.304 --> 02:35:03.645]  to midnight on Monday night.
[02:35:04.325 --> 02:35:10.291]  And then we're going to go for 24 hours from 8 a.m.
[02:35:10.311 --> 02:35:10.931]  to 8 a.m.
[02:35:11.231 --> 02:35:12.312]  on Tuesday into Wednesday.
[02:35:13.894 --> 02:35:15.475]  And this will be a day long remembered.
[02:35:18.359 --> 02:35:21.880]  Because if we can beat them here, we're gonna win no matter what.
[02:35:22.681 --> 02:35:26.382]  But if we can beat them, and this midterm is Waterloo, baby.
[02:35:27.942 --> 02:35:31.424]  It's, uh... That's how to go to your calls.
[02:35:31.444 --> 02:35:32.484]  This is such an epic time.
[02:35:35.045 --> 02:35:37.786]  Just choose what side you're on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:37.806 --> 02:35:39.126]  And I know the audience knows that.
[02:35:40.046 --> 02:35:43.608]  I'm talking to people who are part of the power structure, or think they are.
[02:35:44.128 --> 02:35:47.089]  You are not successful because you are a idiot.
[02:35:49.016 --> 02:35:49.897]  Serving the system.
[02:35:50.337 --> 02:35:52.018]  Have you been to Communist China?
[02:35:52.859 --> 02:35:54.119]  Do you know how evil they are?
[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:54.800]  How cold?
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:00.704]  You know our tech leader allied with them and our bloodthirsty little creeps that pay no taxes and then lecture everybody all day?
[02:36:01.044 --> 02:36:02.765]  These people are horrible!
[02:36:03.326 --> 02:36:05.547]  What type of crazy people would help them?
[02:36:08.509 --> 02:36:09.150]  But I know why.
[02:36:10.083 --> 02:36:14.346]  They offered me a million, they offered me three million, they offered me ten million dollars a year!
[02:36:14.426 --> 02:36:15.487]  And you say, well, why don't you say who?
[02:36:15.527 --> 02:36:18.709]  Well, I'm a business guy and I'm a journalist.
[02:36:18.769 --> 02:36:21.751]  If something's off-record meeting, it's not criminal, I don't release it.
[02:36:24.933 --> 02:36:26.974]  And I haven't had them try to buy me off in about ten years.
[02:36:27.655 --> 02:36:28.896]  Some of that just started up again.
[02:36:32.098 --> 02:36:36.361]  But, let's just say this.
[02:36:38.436 --> 02:36:44.940]  I hear people that sell out for nothing, and they sell out to be on the local news being traitors to humanity.
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.023]  And it's pathetic, and it's sick, and it's disgusting.
[02:36:49.043 --> 02:36:51.204]  People go, well, God, you turned down $10 million?
[02:36:53.605 --> 02:36:57.088]  For my children's birthright, and then we made way more than $10 million a year.
[02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:05.573]  But it wasn't then $10 million a year so I could drive around in a Ferrari or have a helicopter or a private jet, which I don't have.
[02:37:07.367 --> 02:37:15.089]  It was to take that money and put it back in to try to do something, and try to fight back, and try to change the world, and that's what I'm looking for.
[02:37:15.549 --> 02:37:18.750]  And George Soros, with his hundreds of billions of stolen money, he knows that.
[02:37:19.651 --> 02:37:21.691]  But for evil, he's putting it all down against us.
[02:37:22.051 --> 02:37:26.632]  Well, I've only got millions, thanks to you supporting me, and I'm putting it down on the table.
[02:37:27.493 --> 02:37:30.634]  With my name, my blood, the whole nine yards on it, baby.
[02:37:31.634 --> 02:37:33.835]  Because these guys are pieces of crap.
[02:37:33.955 --> 02:37:34.915]  They're really evil.
[02:37:35.751 --> 02:37:38.852]  So to me, it's not even a hard choice to just go all in against them.
[02:37:40.792 --> 02:37:45.233]  If it was some foreign elite trying to make stuff better and was better than our establishment, I'd say, let's get married to these people.
[02:37:45.653 --> 02:37:46.433]  Let's get in bed with them.
[02:37:46.453 --> 02:37:47.513]  That's what old alliances do.
[02:37:47.853 --> 02:37:51.854]  I'm ready to climb in bed with something good that makes the country and humanity better.
[02:37:52.154 --> 02:37:53.114]  This ain't it, man.
[02:37:53.514 --> 02:37:54.834]  I ain't getting in bed with that.
[02:37:55.755 --> 02:37:56.635]  You think I want to die?
[02:37:56.655 --> 02:37:58.355]  You think I want to work 18 hours a day?
[02:37:58.375 --> 02:37:59.975]  You think Trump wants to work 20 hours a day?
[02:38:00.475 --> 02:38:01.096]  That titan?
[02:38:02.096 --> 02:38:02.856]  He's a titan!
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.222]  They're scared to hell of him.
[02:38:05.402 --> 02:38:07.044]  He only uncloaked the last four years.
[02:38:07.725 --> 02:38:10.088]  And played silly so they didn't know what they were dealing with.
[02:38:10.128 --> 02:38:13.352]  The real Donald Trump is fire-breathing liberty.
[02:38:14.694 --> 02:38:21.101]  God sent, as the last doorstop to pure evil, a foot in the door before God closes it.
[02:38:21.322 --> 02:38:22.163]  And you reject Trump?
[02:38:24.534 --> 02:38:25.254]  Katie, bar the door.
[02:38:25.494 --> 02:38:26.554]  My spirit's never wrong.
[02:38:26.795 --> 02:38:31.235]  My spirit says, get behind Trump a trillion percent, Jones, and do it now.
[02:38:31.816 --> 02:38:37.397]  And my spirit's like all the time when I intellectually question something, and it's always BS anyways, and I find out Trump's right.
[02:38:37.857 --> 02:38:40.598]  Then I learn later just how right Trump was.
[02:38:41.298 --> 02:38:42.758]  That's why the enemy cannot stand him.
[02:38:43.038 --> 02:38:45.839]  We must get behind Trump, absolutely committed behind him.
[02:38:46.259 --> 02:38:47.039]  Total alignment!
[02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:53.131]  And that's why I said that at the start of the show yesterday.
[02:38:53.171 --> 02:38:55.573]  I said I am in total alignment with the president.
[02:38:55.953 --> 02:38:57.454]  That means total alignment!
[02:39:02.418 --> 02:39:03.578]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call.
[02:39:04.919 --> 02:39:12.685]  It's been all the longest year I've... Let's talk to Lavona in Texas.
[02:39:12.705 --> 02:39:13.666]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:39:13.706 --> 02:39:13.966]  Go ahead.
[02:39:15.492 --> 02:39:16.292]  Hello, Alex.
[02:39:17.353 --> 02:39:21.014]  I just wanted to say first off that I got a few words for Michael Moore.
[02:39:21.494 --> 02:39:27.076]  It is okay to be white, but it's also okay to wipe them granny beads out from under your chin and find a treadmill.
[02:39:28.417 --> 02:39:40.281]  And I wanted to say that why all of these military and everything, why can't we just do what they did to everybody at the protests at the Tea Party?
[02:39:40.301 --> 02:39:43.102]  You know, you can use flash bang grenades, you can use the
[02:39:44.963 --> 02:39:47.365]  Sound waves that they use to push people away.
[02:39:47.385 --> 02:39:50.308]  Again, that was leftist police doing that to test it out.
[02:39:50.689 --> 02:39:51.870]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:53.311]  And I'm not even saying do that.
[02:39:53.792 --> 02:39:57.115]  But if you don't stem this tide, it's going to collapse all of Latin America into us.
[02:39:57.135 --> 02:39:58.877]  And this is a military attack.
[02:40:00.118 --> 02:40:00.838]  Yes, I know.
[02:40:00.999 --> 02:40:07.105]  And if it's good enough for the American citizen, why can't we just try that first before we go blowing people away?
[02:40:09.554 --> 02:40:10.195]  No, I agree.
[02:40:10.335 --> 02:40:12.236]  Trump, you understand, he doesn't want to shoot them.
[02:40:12.356 --> 02:40:22.904]  He's telling them in the rules of war that I consider you a military force, you've hurt people, you've killed people, you're criminal, and if you try to hit us with deadly weapons, we're going to defend ourselves.
[02:40:23.284 --> 02:40:24.445]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:40:24.465 --> 02:40:35.734]  Because Trump knows that there's a good chance they're going to have snipers hidden on the Soros side to shoot a few migrants, a few invaders, to make Trump look bad, so he has to be up front
[02:40:36.673 --> 02:40:36.953]  Amen.
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:56.521]  Amen.
[02:40:56.921 --> 02:41:03.447]  And we also know that Trump doesn't like to televise and signal to everybody what his game plan is in the long run.
[02:41:03.567 --> 02:41:04.688]  Well, that's actually true.
[02:41:04.728 --> 02:41:08.211]  It's almost bad what I do, because what I do is I kind of let people in on the Trump dimension.
[02:41:08.531 --> 02:41:09.572]  Not that I even have to talk to Trump.
[02:41:09.592 --> 02:41:10.813]  That's why Trump's really into the show.
[02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:13.716]  Me and Trump, the enemy already picked up on this three years ago.
[02:41:13.736 --> 02:41:14.617]  It's like we're synced.
[02:41:15.237 --> 02:41:16.038]  Like word for word.
[02:41:16.058 --> 02:41:18.100]  He'll be giving a speech and I'm saying the exact same thing.
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:19.681]  I'm not just saying that to act cool.
[02:41:19.741 --> 02:41:20.662]  It's really freaky.
[02:41:20.762 --> 02:41:21.583]  It's getting weird.
[02:41:22.822 --> 02:41:25.684]  All right, well thank you Alex, and I want to say this real quick for you.
[02:41:25.824 --> 02:41:28.345]  I love your Secret 12 and I can't wait to order some more.
[02:41:28.645 --> 02:41:29.706]  Thank you, God bless you.
[02:41:29.726 --> 02:41:30.226]  God bless your crew.
[02:41:30.246 --> 02:41:30.587]  Thank you, ma'am.
[02:41:30.707 --> 02:41:32.248]  Thank you, God bless you, sweetheart.
[02:41:32.288 --> 02:41:35.470]  Yeah, it is the best rated vitamin B12 in the country.
[02:41:36.450 --> 02:41:39.372]  BuzzFeed got it, sent it to Mark Cuban's testing lab in San Francisco.
[02:41:39.392 --> 02:41:47.977]  They tested everything, found, okay, it's pure, there's no contaminants, like Jones says, but here is the best B12 in the world, and Jones's is more.
[02:41:49.058 --> 02:41:49.558]  Which is a lie.
[02:41:50.592 --> 02:41:53.214]  My B12 was $10 less and the same stuff, private label.
[02:41:54.635 --> 02:42:00.959]  So they just underhandedly, without knowing, gave me the top rating in the world out of hundreds of items B12s tested for Secret 12.
[02:42:01.819 --> 02:42:04.821]  So thanks a lot, Charlie Wurzel, moron.
[02:42:04.841 --> 02:42:10.365]  All right, we're gonna go to break and then I'm gonna get five calls into this next segment.
[02:42:10.885 --> 02:42:11.566]  We're gonna go to Jeff.
[02:42:13.706 --> 02:42:15.728]  Matt, Joshua, Kathy, everybody.
[02:42:16.528 --> 02:42:20.491]  Rich, Andrew, JD, everyone holding, I will get to you.
[02:42:20.511 --> 02:42:25.255]  But speaking of that, we got a Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:42:26.869 --> 02:42:35.898]  But then they explained to us, you need to put the other two types of iodine in, because it aids in its upload, and a tiny bit of this certain type of vitamin C, keep from oxidizing.
[02:42:35.978 --> 02:42:36.518]  Well, we have it.
[02:42:36.558 --> 02:42:37.519]  The ultimate iodine.
[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:38.841]  Tri-Iodine.
[02:42:38.881 --> 02:42:40.002]  Survival Shield 3.
[02:42:40.722 --> 02:42:43.345]  It's now available 50% off and free shipping.

[02:43:52.810 --> 02:44:00.835]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:44:01.275 --> 02:44:06.198]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[02:44:06.618 --> 02:44:09.860]  Molds have been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:10.961]  That makes me get puffy.
[02:44:12.201 --> 02:44:24.650]  But if I use just one little container of Angelus, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:28.753]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[02:44:29.114 --> 02:44:31.936]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[02:44:32.336 --> 02:44:33.497]  So, again, just twist it off.
[02:44:35.482 --> 02:44:38.545]  Even a dummy like me can put it under.
[02:44:39.365 --> 02:44:45.390]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that.
[02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:52.977]  But when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, it's something good to do.
[02:44:53.597 --> 02:44:56.159]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[02:44:57.501 --> 02:45:00.183]  I have found that the times I've used it,
[02:45:03.112 --> 02:45:05.272]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[02:45:05.793 --> 02:45:06.273]  So there you go.
[02:45:06.373 --> 02:45:08.333]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[02:45:08.453 --> 02:45:11.434]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[02:45:11.834 --> 02:45:15.375]  All I know is over the years I've tried some other products, they haven't done anything.
[02:45:15.395 --> 02:45:16.915]  Ageless has a massive effect.
[02:45:17.415 --> 02:45:21.856]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[02:45:21.876 --> 02:45:23.136]  It's good for men and women.
[02:45:23.856 --> 02:45:28.097]  And you fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:45:28.137 --> 02:45:30.718]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[02:45:32.124 --> 02:45:32.965]  I'm a human being.
[02:45:33.065 --> 02:45:33.847]  I have dignity.
[02:45:34.127 --> 02:45:35.009]  I'm gonna resist.
[02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:37.112]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[02:45:37.172 --> 02:45:38.675]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[02:45:38.715 --> 02:45:40.118]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[02:45:50.552 --> 02:45:51.173]  So there you go.
[02:45:52.034 --> 02:45:53.755]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[02:45:53.795 --> 02:45:56.478]  Not as good as a woman or somebody that's good at this stuff.
[02:45:56.979 --> 02:45:58.160]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.261]  It already feels good.
[02:45:59.601 --> 02:46:00.222]  Feels cool.
[02:46:01.143 --> 02:46:02.404]  It's pretty much dry now.
[02:46:03.165 --> 02:46:04.606]  I'll go back and look at the time lapse.
[02:46:05.047 --> 02:46:05.807]  It's pretty dramatic.
[02:46:06.228 --> 02:46:07.229]  At least the past one I've done it.
[02:46:07.249 --> 02:46:07.990]  We'll see what happens here.
[02:46:08.730 --> 02:46:14.995]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[02:46:15.075 --> 02:46:18.278]  It's all amazing cutting edge at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:46:18.818 --> 02:46:21.240]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts.
[02:46:21.681 --> 02:46:22.722]  There's a lot of different specials.
[02:46:22.742 --> 02:46:31.449]  You can also sign up to be a distributor, and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful, capitalist, and free again.
[02:46:32.109 --> 02:46:32.950]  Wars are expensive.
[02:46:33.010 --> 02:46:33.730]  We're fighting one.
[02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.531]  We're winning.
[02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:35.551]  Thanks for your support.
[02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:39.594]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us, and this one is a big winner.
[02:46:40.034 --> 02:46:43.396]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfowarsYes.com.
[02:46:43.416 --> 02:46:45.818]  You can also find banners at Infowars.com.
[02:46:46.458 --> 02:46:52.162]  Just say yes to health, vitality, and opportunity only at InfowarsYes.com.
[02:46:55.925 --> 02:46:58.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.804 --> 02:47:25.905]  We're gonna go to Matt right now.
[02:47:25.925 --> 02:47:29.086]  We'll talk about caravan migrants and Jade Helm.
[02:47:29.847 --> 02:47:47.736]  But, again, if you just joined us, even Mastercard.com says they're working with George Soros to fund the caravan and other caravans for years, as they're giving them all $1,000 per leg, which is what I've read in USAID documents that Judicial Watch got.
[02:47:49.397 --> 02:47:49.657]  And then,
[02:47:50.714 --> 02:47:54.675]  They have all these articles saying we're insane while it's in the news and admit it.
[02:47:54.795 --> 02:47:56.856]  It's just, it's a tactic.
[02:47:58.837 --> 02:48:00.357]  Where they go, it's good, we're doing it.
[02:48:00.398 --> 02:48:01.498]  We go, well we don't like that.
[02:48:01.718 --> 02:48:02.918]  Oh, we're not doing that, you're crazy.
[02:48:05.819 --> 02:48:07.680]  And so people start tuning out mainstream media.
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:10.601]  And then they just go, we'll just censor everyone.
[02:48:11.642 --> 02:48:12.322]  It's crazy.
[02:48:12.362 --> 02:48:14.102]  These people, I don't see what they're doing working.
[02:48:14.943 --> 02:48:18.164]  Matt in Nebraska, thanks for calling, thanks for holding her on the air, welcome.
[02:48:19.982 --> 02:48:30.735]  I just wondered if you know any connections with Jade Helms and what's going down with the troops, if it's gonna do like what they were talking about, like turning on political dissidents instead of the migrants?
[02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:35.681]  Well that's a great question and that would take hours to get into, but here's what happened four years ago with Jade Helms.
[02:48:37.045 --> 02:48:45.935]  They released the map from CENTCOM that showed Texas is hostile, and conservative Utah is hostile, and Orange County is hostile.
[02:48:45.995 --> 02:48:47.096]  It was meant to provocateur us.
[02:48:47.777 --> 02:48:52.221]  And I said, I believe this is a provocateuring operation to get us to cover it.
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:49:00.204]  Show that we sound anti-military when it says Texas is seen as hostile and that really if you turn it sideways it's a map of the Middle East.
[02:49:00.924 --> 02:49:02.065]  Which at one level it was.
[02:49:02.125 --> 02:49:02.965]  It turned out I was correct.
[02:49:03.626 --> 02:49:07.388]  But it was also mastering the human domain to get the military
[02:49:08.408 --> 02:49:18.797]  To go out and practice working with social media and things during civil unrest or a collapse in the Southwest, because Obama was even claiming it at the time, but he wasn't going to stop the collapse with the immigrant caravans.
[02:49:19.118 --> 02:49:21.680]  But the Border Patrol really didn't follow his orders, so it didn't happen.
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:23.361]  It would be to facilitate it.
[02:49:23.882 --> 02:49:31.208]  So it was a multi-layered psy-op to make us come out against the military, which was super-patriot then, and it's now, for them to know their main mission
[02:49:31.949 --> 02:49:32.049]  Yeah.
[02:49:32.069 --> 02:49:32.309]  And then, uh...
[02:49:59.893 --> 02:50:03.137]  Also, CNN, I always like how they ask their guests.
[02:50:03.157 --> 02:50:11.585]  They're trying to get a guest to agree to Trump saying his rhetoric is the cause of the killings and everything else that's going on in hate.
[02:50:12.166 --> 02:50:18.773]  They're just trying to get the one guest to say they agree with him and it's going to throw Trump into impeachment or whatever.
[02:50:18.793 --> 02:50:19.894]  It's ridiculous.
[02:50:22.119 --> 02:50:24.420]  Is anti-semitic or anything else is asinine.
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:25.321]  Trump likes people.
[02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:26.641]  He loves black people.
[02:50:27.182 --> 02:50:28.342]  He loves white people.
[02:50:28.382 --> 02:50:29.102]  He loves Asians.
[02:50:29.122 --> 02:50:30.603]  He loves hard-working, smart people.
[02:50:30.903 --> 02:50:32.064]  He loves Jews.
[02:50:32.804 --> 02:50:35.366]  The orthodox, hard-working Jews he knows and people he loves them.
[02:50:35.926 --> 02:50:39.107]  And so the white supremacists hate Trump because of that.
[02:50:39.127 --> 02:50:40.228]  Well, let's think about this.
[02:50:41.929 --> 02:50:43.890]  Saudi Arabia has trillions of dollars.
[02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:46.091]  It has a million, two million person.
[02:50:47.346 --> 02:50:49.227]  Well, let's be technical.
[02:50:49.267 --> 02:50:55.608]  Two 500,000 person camps and one 1,000,000 person camps that can house 2,000,000 people in air-conditioned two-bedroom tents.
[02:50:56.929 --> 02:50:57.669]  No one's in them.
[02:50:57.689 --> 02:50:58.949]  We don't even know what they're for.
[02:50:59.029 --> 02:51:00.790]  They don't take one illegal alien.
[02:51:00.810 --> 02:51:02.470]  They don't take one refugee.
[02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:05.751]  But then we're supposed to take and you're supposed to take millions of these people.
[02:51:06.331 --> 02:51:08.172]  Why are they okay but we're not okay?
[02:51:08.752 --> 02:51:11.893]  And it's the same thing that we're bad and we're causing violence.
[02:51:12.833 --> 02:51:14.513]  It's just absolute crap.
[02:51:14.553 --> 02:51:15.414]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[02:51:17.958 --> 02:51:30.787]  I'm not here to pay for you in Venezuela who voted for commies and collapsed your country and now you're a mother with 90% men coming up here waving your baby in front of me saying, I hate America, pay for my crap.
[02:51:33.248 --> 02:51:39.893]  While the men with you throw rocks at helicopters because you're a bunch of anti-American trash that was not everybody's trash down there.
[02:51:39.933 --> 02:51:41.554]  They go and they get the worst.
[02:51:41.954 --> 02:51:42.674]  They vet them.
[02:51:42.734 --> 02:51:43.575]  They prepare them.
[02:51:43.835 --> 02:51:44.936]  They ship them up here.
[02:51:46.465 --> 02:51:48.006]  It's a frickin' snake bite, man!
[02:51:48.026 --> 02:51:49.467]  These people are nothing but poison!
[02:51:51.669 --> 02:51:53.191]  If you want to collapse, bring them in!
[02:51:53.731 --> 02:51:54.992]  These are the scum!
[02:51:55.713 --> 02:51:57.674]  You know, just like the Cuban boatlift in, you know, 1980.
[02:51:58.335 --> 02:52:02.058]  They dumped out their mental patients, their criminals, their mentally ill.
[02:52:03.581 --> 02:52:03.921]  Honest.
[02:52:04.141 --> 02:52:05.563]  That's not representative of Cuban-Americans.
[02:52:06.123 --> 02:52:09.386]  People like Ted Cruz are, you know, representative of that.
[02:52:09.406 --> 02:52:09.946]  I love Cubans.
[02:52:10.486 --> 02:52:12.008]  But this is what they do.
[02:52:12.388 --> 02:52:17.492]  This is Fidel Castro and the ghost of Hugo Chavez taking a giant dump on us.
[02:52:18.513 --> 02:52:22.796]  And make no mistake, at least half these people are from Venezuela.
[02:52:22.816 --> 02:52:24.437]  And it's all going to come out.
[02:52:25.518 --> 02:52:26.859]  That's where the first camps were set up.
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:29.942]  A year ago, they began the Elite Frog Invasion Force.
[02:52:32.344 --> 02:52:33.685]  Okay, we got callers in Texas.
[02:52:33.705 --> 02:52:34.125]  We got callers.
[02:52:34.145 --> 02:52:35.987]  The problem is there's so many damn callers.
[02:52:36.387 --> 02:52:37.508]  That's a good problem to have.
[02:52:38.489 --> 02:52:42.872]  Let's talk to Jose in Texas.
[02:52:43.153 --> 02:52:43.933]  Or is that Joshua?
[02:52:44.874 --> 02:52:45.775]  Joshua in Texas.
[02:52:45.795 --> 02:52:46.195]  You're on the air.
[02:52:46.235 --> 02:52:46.535]  Go ahead.
[02:52:47.716 --> 02:52:47.976]  Hello.
[02:52:48.717 --> 02:52:49.037]  Welcome.
[02:52:50.218 --> 02:52:52.440]  Yes, this is Joshua.
[02:52:53.521 --> 02:52:55.322]  I'm from Brownsville, Texas.
[02:52:55.482 --> 02:52:56.163]  I'm on the border.
[02:52:56.463 --> 02:52:57.764]  Yes, I know Brownsville well.
[02:52:59.626 --> 02:53:01.387]  One of the issues I was wanting to say is that
[02:53:02.115 --> 02:53:08.039]  Boca Chica Beach is right next to the Rio Grande River and it's easy for people to cross that area.
[02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:16.845]  I'm thinking we're going to need to have either the Naval or Coast Guard area to be protecting that area because that's an easy area to cross.
[02:53:16.865 --> 02:53:22.989]  By the way, since I was a little kid, I got on a Brownsville and would go across to Mexico and now, as you know, it's not as very safe anymore.
[02:53:23.930 --> 02:53:28.333]  No, I know that for sure because I usually go to fishing there and I have to carry a rifle all the time.
[02:53:30.245 --> 02:53:33.527]  Oh, but you shouldn't be... Beto says you shouldn't have a rifle.
[02:53:34.588 --> 02:53:39.491]  Well, that's why I don't... I didn't vote for him anyway, so... What are people saying with this?
[02:53:39.511 --> 02:53:42.213]  I mean, look, I love it if somebody's really from a community.
[02:53:42.233 --> 02:53:43.474]  He tried to join the Hispanic Caucus.
[02:53:43.494 --> 02:53:44.074]  They said no.
[02:53:44.494 --> 02:53:45.635]  Another thing, it's Irish folks.
[02:53:45.655 --> 02:53:49.057]  I'm part Irish, but an Irish guy's 6'4", saying he's Mexican.
[02:53:49.618 --> 02:53:52.259]  I've heard the Hispanics are really rejecting this fakeness.
[02:53:52.579 --> 02:53:55.581]  Because Ted Cruz doesn't try to sit there and say, oh, look, I'm Latino.
[02:53:55.601 --> 02:53:56.342]  He's just an American.
[02:53:56.362 --> 02:53:57.983]  But people see authentically.
[02:53:58.303 --> 02:53:59.384]  What are people saying about Beto?
[02:54:00.475 --> 02:54:05.938]  Well, I've seen a lot of people posting up signs here in Brownsville to support him and everything.
[02:54:05.958 --> 02:54:12.843]  I haven't really asked many people about questions of that, but there's a lot of people here that do support Trump down here and Ted Cruz.
[02:54:13.203 --> 02:54:15.464]  I agree, but that's what I, but they're scared to say it, aren't they?
[02:54:16.325 --> 02:54:21.268]  Yeah, like, well, we can't even say it because we have neighbors next to us that are anti-Trump supporters.
[02:54:21.288 --> 02:54:21.808]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:54:21.828 --> 02:54:25.070]  If I was Hispanic and I liked Bidos, beat offs,
[02:54:26.437 --> 02:54:27.878]  Policy's better, I would go for him.
[02:54:28.619 --> 02:54:36.885]  But if he verts his signal, imagine if I was Alex Jones my whole life, then I run for office in the Valley and I say, I'm Alejandro.
[02:54:37.906 --> 02:54:42.069]  It's patron, it's a cheap trick, it's gross.
[02:54:43.129 --> 02:54:45.631]  I guess it doesn't work on me because I'm also half Asian, so.
[02:54:47.333 --> 02:54:51.155]  Man, all I know is I'm half free and the other half wants to be free.
[02:54:51.195 --> 02:54:52.797]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Joshua.
[02:54:53.678 --> 02:54:58.041]  Okay, let's talk to Kathy in Oklahoma.
[02:54:58.061 --> 02:54:59.241]  Kathy, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:55:00.102 --> 02:55:01.302]  Yeah, hi Alex, thanks.
[02:55:02.303 --> 02:55:07.766]  I'm going to kind of rush through because I don't want to start coughing, and this is important.
[02:55:08.647 --> 02:55:22.815]  I've got about three ideas, they're all kind of nebulous together there, but for stopping this invasion before they ever get on our ground, they involved initially
[02:55:24.402 --> 02:55:49.957]  Um, LRAD, um, the, uh, audio crowd dispersal weapons that are non-lethal at our border, and also to dominate some, or down there at the, uh, Honduras-Mexico border, where they can flip those things on and run them back away from the, uh, knockin' their gates down.
[02:55:50.837 --> 02:55:51.718]  That also...
[02:55:53.010 --> 02:56:02.515]  I'm thinking this is technologically viable, that it seems like these things could be mounted on at least helicopters, if not on AWACS planes.
[02:56:03.496 --> 02:56:14.481]  I don't know if they'd be fine-tunable enough to use on AWACS, but to stop those caravans and just turn them around and herd them right straight back south.
[02:56:14.501 --> 02:56:18.163]  Well, ma'am, let me assure you that the Pentagon has stuff to control crowds.
[02:56:18.984 --> 02:56:21.065]  Now, let me give you the real news.
[02:56:22.771 --> 02:56:27.993]  If you could stop lightning striking that causes a forest fire, would you not just stop the lightning that struck, right?
[02:56:30.133 --> 02:56:33.374]  Well, also try to do something about the tinder, but yeah.
[02:56:33.575 --> 02:56:36.976]  Sure, yeah, fire breaks and cut out the undergrowth, exactly.
[02:56:37.596 --> 02:56:38.196]  So that's what you do.
[02:56:38.216 --> 02:56:42.918]  But if you could magically, you're talking about a real solution, I'm saying hypothetically, you'd stop the lightning strike, okay?
[02:56:43.998 --> 02:56:46.419]  If we cut the UN funding that goes to the US,
[02:56:47.359 --> 02:56:52.662]  USAID that goes to the UN funding and then goes to Soros and the other foundations, it's the heads off the snake.
[02:56:53.022 --> 02:57:03.287]  Instead of having our military and everything get used up battling this and having to face kids, it's criminals and the Democratic Party and others organizing this with the UN on record and then doing this.
[02:57:03.307 --> 02:57:07.249]  So what you do is, you go after the source of it.
[02:57:08.649 --> 02:57:10.150]  And I'm advising the President
[02:57:11.638 --> 02:57:16.079]  To use covert operations and covert action against the leadership of this.
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:25.542]  The courts are controlled and the globalists keep playing these games and it's time for the president to use covert action against Soros and against Hillary and all of them.
[02:57:25.782 --> 02:57:27.123]  I want covert action.
[02:57:28.503 --> 02:57:36.545]  Anything else is dereliction of duty and I'm telling the patriots and the CIA and the Pentagon and everyone else, I want covert action and I want it now!
[02:57:37.246 --> 02:57:38.406]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:57:42.293 --> 02:57:42.993]  Three words.
[02:57:44.034 --> 02:57:45.715]  Energized quantum state.
[02:57:47.256 --> 02:57:47.776]  Two words.
[02:57:49.397 --> 02:57:49.537]  X3.
[02:57:50.998 --> 02:57:55.341]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[02:57:55.781 --> 02:57:56.661]  And it's for good reasons.
[02:57:57.522 --> 02:57:58.703]  We've done our research.
[02:57:59.003 --> 02:58:00.684]  We've seen how they're targeting the people.
[02:58:01.971 --> 02:58:03.592]  And how they're trying to suppress the population.
[02:58:03.732 --> 02:58:06.293]  And one of their biggest attacks is fluoridation of water.
[02:58:06.713 --> 02:58:07.794]  The bad halogen.
[02:58:07.814 --> 02:58:10.915]  There's a bunch of bad halogens, but fluoride is chief amongst them.
[02:58:10.935 --> 02:58:13.857]  And then they electrify it into an acid base.
[02:58:14.857 --> 02:58:16.338]  So it's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:58:17.771 --> 02:58:30.145]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[02:58:30.705 --> 02:58:34.870]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[02:58:35.110 --> 02:58:35.350]  Folks,
[02:58:37.279 --> 02:58:39.941]  Everything we do makes the Gloveless pull their hair out for a reason.
[02:58:40.162 --> 02:58:43.224]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[02:58:43.384 --> 02:58:45.706]  They are completely into iodine.
[02:58:46.147 --> 02:58:48.148]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[02:58:49.469 --> 02:58:52.852]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[02:58:54.374 --> 02:58:55.475]  X1, X2 were great.
[02:58:56.611 --> 02:58:58.072]  X3 is the next level.
[02:58:58.092 --> 02:59:01.835]  It has the Deep Earth Crystals, the other two types, and a little bit of Vitamin C to energize it.
[02:59:02.236 --> 02:59:05.798]  It's available in 2-ounce and 1-ounce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:05.978 --> 02:59:13.064]  And from the very start, 50% off and free shipping because I want you to get it, and I want you to take it, and I want you to see what it does.
[02:59:13.764 --> 02:59:17.908]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, X3.
[02:59:18.408 --> 02:59:19.409]  Now again, it's an element.
[02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:20.970]  It takes a few weeks to kick in.
[02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:24.272]  A lot of people detoxify about three weeks in.
[02:59:24.313 --> 02:59:25.073]  So be ready for that.
[02:59:25.113 --> 02:59:25.834]  Consult your physician.
[02:59:26.554 --> 02:59:31.096]  Start your journey today at InfoWarsLife.com with our newest product that I'm the most excited about ever.
[02:59:31.737 --> 02:59:32.377]  X3!
[02:59:32.797 --> 02:59:36.739]  Just like our info changes the world, this changes your body and your life.
[02:59:37.919 --> 02:59:38.260]  X3.
[02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:39.020]  You can't lose.
[02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:41.061]  It helps fund the info war and it's great for you.
[02:59:46.123 --> 02:59:50.065]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:59.818 --> 03:00:03.701]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[03:00:03.822 --> 03:00:08.586]  A little secret.
[03:00:08.686 --> 03:00:17.793]  No, make no mistake, we've got people inside Soros' organization.
[03:00:17.813 --> 03:00:22.477]  We've got people inside all the Democratic Party operations.
[03:00:23.799 --> 03:00:26.301]  But you've also got to know they've got people in our organizations.
[03:00:27.287 --> 03:00:30.709]  You also gotta know, these people are mad dogs when it comes to power.
[03:00:30.729 --> 03:00:36.112]  So, folks who don't know what covert action is, that means taking the gloves off.
[03:00:37.093 --> 03:00:39.495]  These people have already taken the gloves off against this country.
[03:00:39.535 --> 03:00:40.455]  They're out of control.
[03:00:41.156 --> 03:00:44.498]  And I don't want to put myself in the position of calling for things like that.
[03:00:45.238 --> 03:00:53.723]  And however the president and others see fit to take care of it, I'm just signaling that this is too extreme, what's going on.
[03:00:53.783 --> 03:00:55.865]  As the president said, we'll shoot your ass.
[03:00:56.505 --> 03:00:58.147]  If you start attacking police and military.
[03:00:58.667 --> 03:01:10.778]  You're attacking our country, you're even worse because you're taking kids with you, you're funded by international war criminals, and we just can't sit here and be candy asses anymore, and then let them stage an event and we all apologize for it.
[03:01:11.198 --> 03:01:12.439]  You're the authors of this!
[03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:22.368]  And for those little children down there, the professors and the operatives and the leftist intelligence operatives,
[03:01:24.724 --> 03:01:26.325]  Who aren't real intelligence operatives.
[03:01:28.607 --> 03:01:35.792]  The Democrats ran more than 30 congressional candidates to the news today that were CIA.
[03:01:36.352 --> 03:01:39.335]  And not military CIA, not real CIA.
[03:01:39.675 --> 03:01:43.277]  The type of CIA that, you know, buys off a university for the shycomps.
[03:01:43.778 --> 03:01:44.679]  We mean traitors.
[03:01:45.799 --> 03:01:47.981]  And they're so pissed Veritas has infiltrated them.
[03:01:51.323 --> 03:01:51.944]  And Veritas
[03:01:53.462 --> 03:01:57.305]  Isn't candy-ass white shoe boy leftists that have a heart on for America.
[03:01:57.365 --> 03:01:58.646]  They're real people.
[03:01:59.507 --> 03:02:03.610]  Trained in tactics and ready to go in.
[03:02:04.431 --> 03:02:06.432]  And they are mopping the floor with you.
[03:02:07.073 --> 03:02:10.495]  Just like every time I've tried to infiltrate something, it's just victory.
[03:02:11.716 --> 03:02:14.278]  Because good people are smarter and stronger than evil.
[03:02:14.699 --> 03:02:16.280]  We get on the field, it's game over.
[03:02:19.557 --> 03:02:27.982]  And, you know, you guys think the left only has former intelligence operatives and people that are training folks to take on the globalists?
[03:02:28.062 --> 03:02:30.003]  We have the real people that have actually done it.
[03:02:31.223 --> 03:02:38.547]  We don't have the traitors that sit behind desks at Harvard and Yale and at the Ford Foundation who have a real hatred of this country.
[03:02:38.647 --> 03:02:40.348]  We have the patriots.
[03:02:42.169 --> 03:02:47.712]  But I don't want people to think that folks that are in intelligence agencies are the answer.
[03:02:48.213 --> 03:02:48.813]  I'm organic.
[03:02:50.956 --> 03:02:52.577]  I didn't go to some defense school.
[03:02:52.697 --> 03:02:54.958]  I didn't sit there and get sent to some CIA school.
[03:02:55.419 --> 03:03:00.422]  I actually went to the school of reality and actually read the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books.
[03:03:00.942 --> 03:03:06.305]  And I actually went out and did the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of missions and the training in the real world by doing it.
[03:03:07.146 --> 03:03:09.027]  And that's why we're so dangerous.
[03:03:09.587 --> 03:03:11.769]  It's because we are on our own.
[03:03:13.069 --> 03:03:20.534]  And because we're on our own, we built the paradigm of the new resistance and the model of crushing the globalists.
[03:03:21.923 --> 03:03:22.943]  That's how innovation works.
[03:03:23.744 --> 03:03:50.153]  It doesn't come out of some weird, twit, inbred, mentally ill woman whose mommy and daddy are mental patients who got donated a bunch of money and they're trust fund kids and they've got some existential thing because at the country club when they were kids, you know, some good-looking wasp made them look bad and they're a little hunchback wasp and so now they hate wasp and they're reliving five years old when someone was rude to mommy.
[03:03:54.901 --> 03:03:56.423]  That's, I mean, let me tell you something.
[03:03:56.603 --> 03:04:00.146]  The average leftist CIA person is a mental patient.
[03:04:01.047 --> 03:04:07.814]  But they revel their little CIA card that they can get into databases and look into what you're doing or where you're going.
[03:04:07.834 --> 03:04:13.819]  And they just feel so, this is a sick, evil ruling class of extreme racists.
[03:04:16.962 --> 03:04:17.083]  And...
[03:04:20.757 --> 03:04:26.318]  I can tell you that they have such a backlog of material with the lawyers that they don't even know what to release.
[03:04:26.358 --> 03:04:27.359]  We have everything.
[03:04:28.439 --> 03:04:28.979]  Everything.
[03:04:29.779 --> 03:04:32.720]  On the New York Times, on the Washington Post, on Hillary.
[03:04:33.140 --> 03:04:36.821]  Because all the thinkers that were conned and were... Here's the secret when I come back.
[03:04:37.361 --> 03:04:37.861]  When I come back.
[03:04:38.881 --> 03:04:39.322]  The secret.
[03:04:40.062 --> 03:04:40.722]  The big secret.
[03:04:41.382 --> 03:04:41.942]  What they fear.
[03:04:42.662 --> 03:04:43.143]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:44.403 --> 03:04:45.243]  They're undoing.
[03:04:45.263 --> 03:04:46.083]  They're doom.
[03:04:46.783 --> 03:04:48.964]  The day of doom is here!
[03:04:52.816 --> 03:05:02.086]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:02.146 --> 03:05:04.428]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:05.029 --> 03:05:11.095]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:11.756 --> 03:05:17.599]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:18.059 --> 03:05:23.662]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:24.382 --> 03:05:31.346]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:32.486 --> 03:05:45.059]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:45.580 --> 03:05:49.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:49.844 --> 03:05:52.547]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:05:54.500 --> 03:05:55.180]  Big Brother.
[03:05:55.620 --> 03:05:56.881]  Mainstream media.
[03:05:57.421 --> 03:05:58.462]  Government cover-ups.
[03:05:59.322 --> 03:06:00.743]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:01.023 --> 03:06:02.083]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:02.663 --> 03:06:07.165]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.505 --> 03:06:08.826]  Get your motor running.
[03:06:08.846 --> 03:06:12.447]  Head out on the highway.
[03:06:12.467 --> 03:06:13.808]  Looking for adventure.
[03:06:15.168 --> 03:06:20.230]  And whatever might come our way!
[03:06:21.511 --> 03:06:23.692]  Nothing's gonna make it happen.
[03:06:31.214 --> 03:06:37.261]  I'm going right back to your calls.
[03:06:37.281 --> 03:06:38.462]  The big secret is this.
[03:06:39.984 --> 03:06:49.415]  There are a lot of people that serve the government corporations and systems that were half awake but didn't know what to do and weren't sure and now they see the full evil of the Democrats.
[03:06:50.424 --> 03:06:58.471]  They may have a bunch of illegal aliens and drug addicts and criminals on their side, but real confident people are now deciding, I'm not part of this.
[03:06:59.031 --> 03:07:01.914]  And they're joining the ranks of Make America Great Again.
[03:07:02.894 --> 03:07:05.737]  And so that's why there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[03:07:06.037 --> 03:07:07.478]  You can't suppress excellence.
[03:07:08.059 --> 03:07:08.599]  You can't do it.
[03:07:09.099 --> 03:07:10.280]  You can kill a few of its leaders.
[03:07:11.434 --> 03:07:14.116]  Who love life, but are ready to take one for the team.
[03:07:14.777 --> 03:07:16.678]  Like, I love life so much I'm willing to die.
[03:07:17.259 --> 03:07:22.823]  I'll never commit suicide, but that's why they can't stand it, because they know I literally have no fear of them.
[03:07:24.064 --> 03:07:26.526]  Because I have fear of them having victory.
[03:07:26.606 --> 03:07:27.287]  That's my fear.
[03:07:27.827 --> 03:07:32.591]  I have fear of these people that want to molest our children, literally running things.
[03:07:32.611 --> 03:07:37.515]  A bunch of devil worshipper perverts that got control of the media, and now they want to run our lives?
[03:07:37.535 --> 03:07:37.575]  No!
[03:07:41.090 --> 03:07:41.931]  J.D.
[03:07:41.991 --> 03:07:44.133]  in the great state of Texas, thanks for holding your Earl Trooper.
[03:07:44.173 --> 03:07:44.633]  God bless you.
[03:07:44.653 --> 03:07:44.953]  Go ahead.
[03:07:44.973 --> 03:07:48.136]  Hey, it's a pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[03:07:48.396 --> 03:07:54.921]  I'm going to get right to the point, dispense with the pleasantries, although I would like to tell you how long I've been listening and all of that.
[03:07:55.642 --> 03:08:09.493]  I'm going to say that for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[03:08:11.075 --> 03:08:15.198]  What I'm getting at is the Globalist Elite Playbook.
[03:08:16.379 --> 03:08:19.740]  Have you ever read Fundamental Laws by the Rose Cross Order?
[03:08:21.461 --> 03:08:22.282]  The Rosicrucians?
[03:08:23.183 --> 03:08:23.483]  Yes.
[03:08:23.643 --> 03:08:24.103]  Yeah, I've read it.
[03:08:25.124 --> 03:08:26.945]  It's the 68th Convocation.
[03:08:28.326 --> 03:08:32.488]  I read some Rosicrucian books about 20 years ago, but yeah, I know about it.
[03:08:33.529 --> 03:08:34.109]  Okay, yeah.
[03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:38.552]  So just to refresh a little bit for everyone else to know, what's
[03:08:39.773 --> 03:08:51.883]  One of the things in their books, they think that they have the real collegiate Bible, and that the commoners have just what everyone else sees out there as the irregular or whatever Bibles are available.
[03:08:52.523 --> 03:09:00.429]  They really believe that in their collegiate Bible, that they're following something that's kind of good.
[03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:01.810]  It's kind of like rat poison.
[03:09:01.931 --> 03:09:06.174]  It's mostly good food, but there's 10% there that just is warped.
[03:09:07.242 --> 03:09:16.866]  And really, you know, it explains the great seal that they devised that's on our money, and it explains, like, the triangle around the eye.
[03:09:16.986 --> 03:09:34.114]  Sure, it's a Gnostic Christian order, and then there's actually multiple Rosicrucian systems, many of which are very evil, but then there's also some that's come out of it, like the New America and the New Atlantis and things, so it gets very confusing.
[03:09:35.265 --> 03:09:36.587]  Exactly, yes.
[03:09:37.267 --> 03:09:43.494]  It's really esoteric and it's one of those things where you kind of have to back up a paragraph and read it over.
[03:09:45.736 --> 03:09:55.206]  But, you know, I just wanted to say, you know, I've been a big fan of all of you guys and all of the hard work and the background people that you just mentioned before.
[03:09:56.167 --> 03:09:56.788]  And lastly,
[03:09:57.738 --> 03:10:07.545]  I know that they're trying to use the Sandy Hook thing to discredit you and basically, you know, boil you down to a vitamin salesman, and that's exactly how they work.
[03:10:07.925 --> 03:10:23.275]  And I want all of your listeners to know, and they probably already do, that that is the only one thing that they're trying to drill home, and the rest of everything else that you've got going on is true authentic American
[03:10:24.909 --> 03:10:26.030]  Well sure, exactly.
[03:10:26.250 --> 03:10:34.719]  They look at a compendium of work, and then misrepresent what I've said about things, and then they make it bad that we fund ourselves, and it's all funded by Soros.
[03:10:34.759 --> 03:10:39.383]  They filed a new Sandy Hook lawsuit yesterday, and because they got mad that some of the suits have been thrown out.
[03:10:39.803 --> 03:10:41.485]  So that's why people supporting us is so critical.
[03:10:41.525 --> 03:10:42.186]  God bless you, J.D.
[03:10:42.226 --> 03:10:43.027]  I appreciate that call.
[03:10:44.724 --> 03:10:48.145]  Yeah, you get into all this esoteric stuff, and it's pretty complex.
[03:10:48.205 --> 03:10:53.846]  I just know I love God, and I believe in white children, black children, pretty little Hispanic children, everybody.
[03:10:53.866 --> 03:10:54.386]  I love everybody.
[03:10:55.366 --> 03:11:00.307]  I just want to have it, but I don't want people weaponized against me because I'm from Europe, and then I'm a bad person.
[03:11:00.827 --> 03:11:05.307]  So, we have to stand up for ourselves, no matter what color you are, where you came from.
[03:11:05.327 --> 03:11:07.548]  We have to see the bigger picture, and who's behind what.
[03:11:09.128 --> 03:11:13.889]  Okay, let's go ahead and... Etion.
[03:11:15.822 --> 03:11:17.263]  ET on in Texas.
[03:11:17.303 --> 03:11:17.743]  You're on the air.
[03:11:17.783 --> 03:11:18.123]  Go ahead.
[03:11:18.683 --> 03:11:19.224]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:19.284 --> 03:11:20.044]  How's it going?
[03:11:20.224 --> 03:11:20.644]  Greetings.
[03:11:20.985 --> 03:11:21.345]  Greetings.
[03:11:21.385 --> 03:11:21.625]  Welcome.
[03:11:21.685 --> 03:11:24.526]  America is for President Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:11:25.046 --> 03:11:35.411]  Anything now, any other person, Hispanic, who wants to consider themselves an American or anything other than a real Jesus Christ believer is a fake and is a terrorist.
[03:11:36.391 --> 03:11:37.592]  I come from California.
[03:11:38.512 --> 03:11:40.713]  I made my move back to Texas for this reason.
[03:11:41.153 --> 03:11:44.695]  I see the Rio Grande Valley falling because of their belief
[03:11:45.359 --> 03:11:47.480]  Well, that's awesome.
[03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:48.701]  Say it slower.
[03:11:48.821 --> 03:11:50.402]  What's the name of your YouTube channel?
[03:12:14.006 --> 03:12:15.387]  Um, calabazo first.
[03:12:15.627 --> 03:12:18.850]  C-A-L-A-B-A-S-O first.
[03:12:18.930 --> 03:12:20.431]  Sure, what does calabazo mean in Spanish?
[03:12:20.491 --> 03:12:20.891]  I forget.
[03:12:21.892 --> 03:12:24.974]  Um, it's supposed to be like a squash, pumpkin.
[03:12:26.215 --> 03:12:29.377]  Um, I kind of made it into my own, just for that purpose.
[03:12:30.609 --> 03:12:31.209]  Well, that's good.
[03:12:31.270 --> 03:12:31.850]  What do you think?
[03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:32.931]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[03:12:32.951 --> 03:12:35.553]  They organized a bunch of communists in South America.
[03:12:35.653 --> 03:12:36.354]  March them up.
[03:12:36.854 --> 03:12:38.555]  It's openly run by the UN, the Democrats.
[03:12:38.595 --> 03:12:44.720]  I mean, this is insanely obvious that our whole media tries to cover it up, even though a year ago Soros said he was doing it.
[03:12:46.782 --> 03:12:47.242]  Okay, yeah.
[03:12:47.623 --> 03:12:51.305]  So, we know we've been infiltrated.
[03:12:51.406 --> 03:12:55.409]  We're being torn down by our own people.
[03:12:55.969 --> 03:12:58.091]  What is important is
[03:12:58.755 --> 03:13:05.982]  Many people will not understand, especially the Hispanic people, will not understand who George Soros is.
[03:13:06.422 --> 03:13:12.207]  Everything that he's done has worked perfectly towards his plan, except in our eyes, the ones that are open.
[03:13:12.227 --> 03:13:14.109]  He is an anti-Christian demon.
[03:13:17.185 --> 03:13:17.865]  Correct, yes.
[03:13:18.366 --> 03:13:21.207]  And what we must do, we must continue pushing what we're doing.
[03:13:21.667 --> 03:13:22.808]  I thank you for your call, Alex.
[03:13:23.168 --> 03:13:24.748]  I appreciate all of your products.
[03:13:24.969 --> 03:13:28.170]  I just received it on Monday, and I see the results.
[03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:28.910]  It's beautiful.
[03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:29.471]  It's awesome.
[03:13:29.751 --> 03:13:34.553]  I've been a longtime listener, and I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with y'all.
[03:13:34.853 --> 03:13:36.014]  God bless you, Etion.
[03:13:51.732 --> 03:13:55.995]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler, because they're scared of real supplements.
[03:13:56.015 --> 03:14:01.859]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:03.821]  So Ikra and Infowarshore.com.
[03:14:03.901 --> 03:14:04.782]  Look, I've got...
[03:14:05.618 --> 03:14:06.558]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:14:06.578 --> 03:14:07.419]  What do you think about this?
[03:14:07.439 --> 03:14:08.819]  Alex Jones does Boss Hogg in whiteface.
[03:14:35.074 --> 03:14:36.375]  Yeah, you're pretty funny.
[03:14:36.415 --> 03:14:37.275]  I can do a boss hug.
[03:14:38.035 --> 03:14:39.236]  You'll trigger the whole world.
[03:14:40.216 --> 03:14:42.877]  But seriously, my point is this.
[03:14:43.057 --> 03:14:53.702]  I'd like to talk about what I call Operation Suppository being activated right now with Caesar Sayoc, Michael Moore, and the Pope.
[03:14:53.902 --> 03:15:04.186]  When Caesar Sayoc came out, rolled out, and it all blew up, and no pun intended, and was revealed to be a total fraud, framing the right,
[03:15:05.183 --> 03:15:15.514]  Um, a few days later, Michael Moore magically comes up with footage of this guy at a rally, and that's been all over news I haven't heard about.
[03:15:15.534 --> 03:15:16.956]  Oh yeah, no, I should have mentioned it here.
[03:15:16.996 --> 03:15:19.198]  Yeah, no, it's just funny that Michael Moore magically had that footage.
[03:15:20.479 --> 03:15:26.566]  He has this footage, and then he's visiting the Pope, of all people.
[03:15:27.675 --> 03:15:38.942]  And Steve Pchenik, um, on The War Room, brought out an interesting point, saying Caesar Syoc, his name means Emperor, first name, and last name, Master of Chaos.
[03:15:40.063 --> 03:15:40.563]  No, it's true.
[03:15:40.603 --> 03:15:41.764]  We should get Pchenik back on.
[03:15:41.804 --> 03:15:42.284]  Great point.
[03:15:42.304 --> 03:15:49.308]  Well, we know the Pope is a pedophile master, and Michael Moore looks like the biggest, fattest, ugliest pedophile I ever saw.
[03:15:49.328 --> 03:15:50.329]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[03:15:51.966 --> 03:15:56.754]  Senator Warren's family has long told stories that they have some Native American heritage.
[03:15:56.794 --> 03:16:00.019]  Now, some people don't believe that, and his name is Donald Trump.
[03:16:00.538 --> 03:16:01.418]  Breaking news this morning.
[03:16:01.458 --> 03:16:07.620]  Senator Elizabeth Warren has released results of a DNA test showing she does have Native American ancestry.
[03:16:07.780 --> 03:16:17.663]  Massachusetts Senator and possible presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren released results of a DNA test she says proves she has some Native American heritage.
[03:16:17.783 --> 03:16:20.964]  Strong evidence that she has Native American heritage.
[03:16:20.984 --> 03:16:24.365]  DNA analysis proves she has Native American heritage.
[03:16:24.525 --> 03:16:28.768]  Elizabeth Warren can now officially say that she is part Native American.
[03:16:28.929 --> 03:16:32.051]  It's past time to separate politics from fact.
[03:16:32.571 --> 03:16:38.176]  And the fact is, the people calling Warren a liar just don't have a leg to stand on.
[03:16:38.336 --> 03:16:45.462]  President Trump, who calls her Pocahontas, has suggested he would pay a million dollars to a charity if she took a DNA test to prove her heritage.
[03:16:45.502 --> 03:16:48.204]  When told of the test results today, here's what President Trump said.
[03:16:48.544 --> 03:16:49.144]  Who cares?
[03:16:50.185 --> 03:16:50.745]  Who cares?
[03:16:50.945 --> 03:16:51.425]  Who cares?
[03:16:51.505 --> 03:16:52.005]  Who cares?
[03:16:52.085 --> 03:16:52.645]  You care!
[03:16:52.745 --> 03:16:53.466]  You care!
[03:16:53.766 --> 03:16:56.487]  You're literally the only person who cares!
[03:16:56.507 --> 03:17:05.210]  I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you're an Indian.
[03:17:08.397 --> 03:17:16.526]  Donald Trump promised he'd donate $1 million to charity if Senator Elizabeth Warren could prove she had Native American ancestry.
[03:17:16.667 --> 03:17:18.909]  Well, the DNA results are in!
[03:17:22.446 --> 03:17:22.946]  She is!
[03:17:23.947 --> 03:17:28.450]  Even though Elizabeth Warren took the test, now he says he's not going to pay the million dollars.
[03:17:28.690 --> 03:17:34.775]  When confronted about his million dollar pledge this afternoon, he chickened out.
[03:17:34.815 --> 03:17:36.856]  The president is scoffing at the results.
[03:17:37.236 --> 03:17:37.576]  How much?
[03:17:37.737 --> 03:17:38.597]  One one thousand?
[03:17:38.877 --> 03:17:40.158]  Do you owe her an apology?
[03:17:40.178 --> 03:17:42.240]  What about the money that you owe her?
[03:17:42.260 --> 03:17:43.701]  She owes the country an apology.
[03:17:43.801 --> 03:17:46.082]  We don't have to wait for the president's DNA.
[03:17:46.383 --> 03:17:46.863]  He is 100% douche.
[03:17:51.221 --> 03:17:53.082]  Elizabeth Warren taking the bait.
[03:17:53.522 --> 03:17:58.583]  Now, if the president likes to call my mom a liar, what do the facts say?
[03:17:58.883 --> 03:18:02.884]  The facts suggest that you could absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree.
[03:18:03.224 --> 03:18:05.105]  This is absolute pure bull.
[03:18:05.305 --> 03:18:07.746]  Don't believe the crap you see from these people.
[03:18:07.986 --> 03:18:08.846]  The fake news.
[03:18:09.818 --> 03:18:11.139]  I'm an Indian outlaw.
[03:18:11.860 --> 03:18:13.942]  Half Cherokee and Choctaw.
[03:18:14.082 --> 03:18:15.664]  My baby, she's a Chippewa.
[03:18:16.184 --> 03:18:17.486]  She's a one-of-a-kind.
[03:18:17.766 --> 03:18:22.590]  Elizabeth Warren is whiter than your average white person.
[03:18:22.711 --> 03:18:27.896]  My papa had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do.
[03:18:30.491 --> 03:18:31.572]  That's embarrassing.
[03:18:31.872 --> 03:18:34.353]  Pocahontas is on the warpath!
[03:18:34.393 --> 03:18:35.734]  They call her Pocahontas.
[03:18:36.094 --> 03:18:36.594]  Pocahontas!
[03:18:36.834 --> 03:18:39.435]  What does Warren translate into Cherokee as?
[03:18:39.455 --> 03:18:44.858]  Spreading bull?
[03:18:46.679 --> 03:18:51.381]  If Senator Warren sets the standard, you too could claim a minority preference.
[03:18:51.401 --> 03:18:55.403]  But I knew my father's family didn't like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware.
[03:18:55.903 --> 03:18:57.243]  So my parents had to allow it.
[03:19:07.501 --> 03:19:12.244]  Most white Americans have more Native American blood than Senator Warren.
[03:19:12.424 --> 03:19:15.146]  She's potentially 1, 1000th and 24th Indian, which is 0.09%.
[03:19:21.075 --> 03:19:25.079]  I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage.
[03:19:25.259 --> 03:19:30.023]  The university actually celebrated her as the first minority woman to receive tenure.
[03:19:30.343 --> 03:19:34.407]  Warren posed as a victim because on the left, victimhood is power.
[03:19:34.567 --> 03:19:36.869]  Warren is trying to play the victim.
[03:19:36.949 --> 03:19:38.410]  I'm 13% victim.
[03:19:38.490 --> 03:19:39.351]  I'm 21% victim.
[03:19:39.972 --> 03:19:44.516]  Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you, DNA and me.
[03:19:45.316 --> 03:19:45.837]  Are you in?
[03:19:46.818 --> 03:19:47.999]  Hell f***ing yes I'm in.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:19:59.161]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.864 --> 03:20:08.565]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.165 --> 03:20:12.907]  What a bummer.
[03:20:13.247 --> 03:20:17.929]  I just missed a Ted Nugent call an hour ago.
[03:20:17.949 --> 03:20:19.429]  I was looking at my phone.
[03:20:19.889 --> 03:20:21.930]  I missed the President's call, Ted Nugent's call.
[03:20:21.950 --> 03:20:23.511]  It just gets worse and worse from here.
[03:20:25.572 --> 03:20:26.792]  It's fun to be in the fight, though, isn't it?
[03:20:27.953 --> 03:20:29.493]  Not name-dropping, but I am name-dropping.
[03:20:30.513 --> 03:20:31.274]  Oh, there he is again.
[03:20:32.894 --> 03:20:34.274]  Hey, Daria, come get it.
[03:20:34.294 --> 03:20:35.755]  He's asking for the right hotline number.
[03:20:37.135 --> 03:20:38.855]  You were hearing it, but I didn't hear what you said.
[03:20:38.876 --> 03:20:39.796]  We've got like three hotlines.
[03:20:39.816 --> 03:20:40.396]  Just come take it.
[03:20:41.956 --> 03:20:43.517]  Poor Gilbert's about to get preempted.
[03:20:43.797 --> 03:20:44.737]  Just come on in here and get it.
[03:20:44.757 --> 03:20:49.478]  Because you're telling me those mics you use are distorted.
[03:20:49.538 --> 03:20:50.198]  I can't hear a word.
[03:20:50.799 --> 03:20:51.139]  There you go.
[03:20:51.159 --> 03:20:51.959]  Go ahead and text him the number.
[03:20:53.407 --> 03:20:54.788]  Poor Gilbert's getting preempted.
[03:20:54.828 --> 03:20:55.308]  That's okay.
[03:20:55.328 --> 03:20:56.108]  He can join us tomorrow.
[03:20:56.128 --> 03:20:56.969]  Good old Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:56.989 --> 03:20:58.630]  He's always amped up and ready to go.
[03:20:59.370 --> 03:21:01.051]  Who's up next here?
[03:21:02.932 --> 03:21:04.473]  Who's been holding the longest now here?
[03:21:05.674 --> 03:21:05.974]  Rich?
[03:21:08.655 --> 03:21:09.136]  Brad?
[03:21:09.236 --> 03:21:09.716]  Stephanie?
[03:21:13.998 --> 03:21:15.139]  Andrew's been holding the longest.
[03:21:15.299 --> 03:21:16.219]  Andrew in Florida.
[03:21:16.239 --> 03:21:17.220]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:17.560]  Go ahead.
[03:21:18.821 --> 03:21:20.242]  Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[03:21:21.813 --> 03:21:26.757]  And all I can say is that I feel like it's déjà vu all over again from 2016.
[03:21:27.737 --> 03:21:29.158]  You know, you feel the confidence.
[03:21:29.419 --> 03:21:40.306]  If you're looking at the early voting numbers that are happening in Florida, Texas, Georgia, the states that they keep saying are all going to go blue, you know, I'm starting to feel déjà vu.
[03:21:40.407 --> 03:21:43.289]  This is exactly what happened last time, last cycle.
[03:21:43.829 --> 03:21:44.990]  All the polls were cooked.
[03:21:45.250 --> 03:21:50.614]  If you look at the samples for the polls now, that CNN, USA Today, everybody,
[03:21:55.135 --> 03:21:58.857]  I believe there's been one poll that has brought DeSantis up in Florida.
[03:21:59.357 --> 03:22:00.078]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:22:00.118 --> 03:22:00.838]  Here's the problem.
[03:22:01.759 --> 03:22:04.961]  When we zig-de-zagged, they put out totally fake polls for Hillary.
[03:22:05.361 --> 03:22:06.822]  They know she was behind from the beginning.
[03:22:06.842 --> 03:22:10.685]  That made them really scared, so they overcompensated, tried to steal a bunch of states.
[03:22:11.858 --> 03:22:19.806]  Now, they still keep over-sampling, but they're not doing it as much, and they're engaged in massive fraud and massive spending.
[03:22:20.227 --> 03:22:26.293]  So I agree, gut-level and looking at all the tea leaves, I think we barely keep the House, even gain a seat or two in the Senate.
[03:22:27.196 --> 03:22:35.299]  The problem is that they are in just flame-throwing lies right now, and just doing so many things.
[03:22:35.359 --> 03:22:40.141]  So, can our red wave overtake their blue seawall?
[03:22:40.221 --> 03:22:41.021]  Thank you for calling.
[03:22:41.701 --> 03:22:53.946]  Well, joining us, ladies and gentlemen, with just three and a half days left to the big decision, what they're calling the most important election in modern history, is the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, for this segment and the next.
[03:22:54.486 --> 03:22:55.950]  Uncle Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:22:55.990 --> 03:23:02.387]  I know you've been campaigning hard up there in Michigan, and I just wanted to get your take on what your gut level is thinking right now.
[03:23:03.208 --> 03:23:12.714]  Well, more important than my take, Alex, is truth, logic, and common sense, and the pulse of, you know, honest, conscientious, working hard, playing hard America.
[03:23:12.754 --> 03:23:20.699]  We talk about this every time, but these are just outrageous, bizarro world times that we're dealing with right now.
[03:23:20.739 --> 03:23:31.666]  So let me share with you, from the sacred swamps of Michigan, and by the way, Alex, I hope you know, and I know you do, that I don't get out of my tree stand on November 2nd for just anybody.
[03:23:31.846 --> 03:23:32.266]  I know that.
[03:23:32.786 --> 03:23:49.694]  This is so important, and you're right, I am busting my ass to get truth, logic, and common sense back into my beloved birth state of Michigan, the epicenter of productivity and work ethic and family pride and earning your own way and helping your neighbors.
[03:23:49.734 --> 03:23:55.657]  I mean, when I was born in 1948, Michigan was the example the whole world looked at.
[03:23:55.677 --> 03:23:58.798]  The only other powerhouse close to it was Texas.
[03:23:58.858 --> 03:23:59.939]  I mean, you guys were everything.
[03:24:00.635 --> 03:24:20.205]  Sure, and now that I'm a Texan, I'm still up here in Michigan because can you imagine a worse curse that you would hang your head in shame than when the media during the 2016 election constantly referred to my state, my original home and birth state of Michigan, as a reliably blue state?
[03:24:21.426 --> 03:24:22.307]  We're good to go.
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:40.661]  And the pulse!
[03:24:41.322 --> 03:24:53.952]  I get around the campfire from great entrepreneurial families, just dedicated generous loving families that donate to these children's charities and these military charities that we donate these hunts for auctions.
[03:24:54.392 --> 03:24:57.575]  And Alex, you're not alone!
[03:24:58.546 --> 03:25:00.208]  I'm not alone.
[03:25:00.569 --> 03:25:13.304]  You're damn right we're radical because the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, the Declaration of Independence, rugged individualism is radical in a world of sheep where tyrants and
[03:25:13.404 --> 03:25:14.005]  We're good to go.
[03:25:41.599 --> 03:25:49.211]  And heartbreak around the Nugent campfire every day from men and women and families, young kids, special needs kids, Alex.
[03:25:49.852 --> 03:25:57.343]  They can't believe that there's a political party in America that doesn't believe in America first!
[03:25:58.847 --> 03:25:59.607]  Let me stop you.
[03:25:59.668 --> 03:26:00.669]  Let me stop you, Ted.
[03:26:00.909 --> 03:26:01.529]  You're on fire.
[03:26:02.571 --> 03:26:13.302]  We have Democratic leaders like Michael Moore and like Cuomo of New York saying America was never great and it's not gonna be great and they really aren't Americans.
[03:26:13.342 --> 03:26:17.066]  They hate this country like baby ducks that imprinted on evil.
[03:26:17.146 --> 03:26:18.207]  What's wrong with them?
[03:26:19.016 --> 03:26:27.145]  Well, I've got a bunch of theories, but I've dealt with them, and I've got to tell you, it's really, it's so strange, because I'm a logic guy.
[03:26:27.185 --> 03:26:28.247]  You know, 1 and 1 equals 2.
[03:26:28.627 --> 03:26:30.930]  I don't care how uncomfortable you are with the number 2.
[03:26:30.970 --> 03:26:31.710]  1 and 1 equals 2.
[03:26:34.033 --> 03:26:34.613]  I think?
[03:27:04.754 --> 03:27:10.681]  Not in America would be against the President providing security at our borders.
[03:27:10.921 --> 03:27:17.990]  This is Planet of the Apes, Cuckoo's Nest, Clockwork Dayglo, Orange, Twilight Zone, Zombieland USA.
[03:27:19.171 --> 03:27:20.672]  Thank you for raising hell.
[03:27:21.032 --> 03:27:23.733]  Thank you for spotlighting cockroaches in Texas.
[03:27:24.274 --> 03:27:32.918]  I pray to God we haven't been infiltrated in Texas by a bunch of escaped Californians and Washingtons and Oregonians and left-wing goofballs.
[03:27:33.438 --> 03:27:42.583]  I hope that we vote for Ted Cruz, who is a constitutionalist, and Beto O'Rourke is an America-hating, sanctuary-city, gun-controlling,
[03:27:45.947 --> 03:27:46.728]  I think so.
[03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:09.273]  America is standing strong because we have a calorie... Ted, stay there.
[03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:11.716]  I know you've been kicking ass up in Michigan.
[03:28:11.736 --> 03:28:12.336]  We've got to go to break.
[03:28:12.356 --> 03:28:13.618]  I think we've got to go in like five minutes.
[03:28:13.938 --> 03:28:15.519]  We're going to come back and have you finish up on it.
[03:28:15.539 --> 03:28:16.280]  I'm sure you heard it.
[03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:16.761]  You may not.
[03:28:17.161 --> 03:28:19.323]  Beto O'Rourke got caught working for Soros.
[03:28:19.383 --> 03:28:20.144]  It's mainstream news.
[03:28:20.184 --> 03:28:20.905]  Project Veritas.
[03:28:21.385 --> 03:28:23.847]  With MasterCard, he's funding the whole thing.
[03:28:24.067 --> 03:28:29.772]  They've already got caravans hitting, and they're giving them $1,000 credit cards, including smuggled kids.
[03:28:30.132 --> 03:28:31.193]  They got the videos.

[03:28:38.419 --> 03:28:40.341]  Turns out she's a lifelong Democrat.
[03:28:40.561 --> 03:28:42.342]  He wants to ban all semi-autos.
[03:28:42.743 --> 03:28:45.445]  Ted Nugent, the titan of America.
[03:28:45.865 --> 03:28:48.067]  Straight ahead, only three and a half days out.

[03:29:49.179 --> 03:29:51.500]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:53.301 --> 03:29:54.622]  Kevin Jackson's our guest.
[03:29:55.743 --> 03:30:02.287]  Fox News, former contributor, got fired for, well, I'll read some of the quotes here, but here's the issue.
[03:30:02.667 --> 03:30:03.707]  It's all selective.
[03:30:03.767 --> 03:30:07.950]  Libertarians, nationalists, conservatives, we can't say anything.
[03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:20.997]  But the left, major antifa groups with hundreds of thousands of followers can say, don't just kill Ted Cruz or Vice President Pence, led by this New York City professor, leading groups in DC.
[03:30:22.122 --> 03:30:23.602]  We need to kill the staff.
[03:30:24.062 --> 03:30:30.744]  We need to, is what those Twitter accounts from Antifa were saying, kill the staff for serving Ted Cruz.
[03:30:30.944 --> 03:30:34.024]  This is bizarre bullying, and it's getting crazier and crazier.
[03:30:34.044 --> 03:30:39.285]  So I want to ask Kevin Jackson, what do you think peak Trump derangement syndrome will look like?
[03:30:39.345 --> 03:30:46.286]  Because it's getting crazier and wilder, and their wish to persecute people and censor people is so authoritarian.
[03:30:46.406 --> 03:30:47.787]  A, how bad will it get?
[03:30:47.867 --> 03:30:49.787]  And B, how big will the backlash be?
[03:30:49.887 --> 03:30:57.056]  I think you're going to see somebody get killed and eventually the left is going to finally wake up and start seeing just how crazy they are.
[03:30:57.096 --> 03:30:58.718]  Look, it's already starting in academia.
[03:30:59.159 --> 03:31:04.666]  You got professors that said we have raised a bunch of feral animals here and we can't handle it.
[03:31:04.706 --> 03:31:05.707]  So you have groups like
[03:31:06.921 --> 03:31:12.465]  I can't recall the name now, but there's a group of professors that formed that said, we've gone too far.
[03:31:12.485 --> 03:31:19.270]  You know, we let this political correctness, this snowflake generation take it to a level that's untenable.
[03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:20.691]  And so they're chasing him out.
[03:31:20.731 --> 03:31:25.274]  Remember the professor that they wanted to have only blacks on campus day up at Evergreen College?
[03:31:25.674 --> 03:31:27.175]  And this white professor didn't get the word.
[03:31:27.195 --> 03:31:28.016]  So he's on campus.
[03:31:28.296 --> 03:31:31.358]  They chased him off that college and he never went back.
[03:31:31.858 --> 03:31:33.279]  So that's the type of thing you're seeing.
[03:31:33.779 --> 03:31:35.941]  And look, we're talking about name calling.
[03:31:36.382 --> 03:31:40.317]  Look, there's nobody on the planet that gets called worse names than a black conservative.
[03:31:40.377 --> 03:31:42.485]  I could give you 50 without even breaking a sweat.
[03:31:43.383 --> 03:31:44.463]  And I'll clean one up for you.
[03:31:44.483 --> 03:31:46.984]  I get called Coon Butt Negro in a different way.
[03:31:47.704 --> 03:31:53.086]  Step and Fetch and Uncle Tom Cooler the Man, Opera Thomas, Rush Limbaugh wannabe, all kinds of things.
[03:31:53.986 --> 03:31:55.126]  And they get worse than that.
[03:31:55.146 --> 03:32:03.729]  It's funny, I was talking about this the other day, Alex, and it's okay for a white person to call a black man the N-word as long as you're directing it at a conservative.
[03:32:03.789 --> 03:32:06.690]  Blacks allow it and white leftists will allow it.
[03:32:06.990 --> 03:32:07.710]  The tolerance
[03:32:08.130 --> 03:32:08.390]  I think?
[03:32:28.591 --> 03:32:32.772]  More beatings and finally killings, I think, with us being the victims.
[03:32:33.373 --> 03:32:36.734]  And then finally, we start fighting back and then it starts happening to them.
[03:32:36.774 --> 03:32:42.176]  And I think once that occurs, when we start whooping that butt, then you're gonna see guys going, okay, you better leave him alone.
[03:32:42.456 --> 03:32:47.977]  I mean, when you ask me how ridiculous can it get, I will tell you, whatever we are right now, wait a day.
[03:32:48.338 --> 03:32:49.618]  It'll get even more ridiculous.
[03:32:55.797 --> 03:33:00.400]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.591 --> 03:33:21.236]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.340 --> 03:33:28.142]  Let me tell you, we just had a four-minute break, and if he could repeat what he said on air, it's unbelievable.
[03:33:28.542 --> 03:33:30.262]  Ted Nugent is on fire.
[03:33:31.003 --> 03:33:32.083]  The force is with him.
[03:33:32.583 --> 03:33:36.024]  I was getting into Beto and the big Veritas thing that they're running with the UN.
[03:33:36.585 --> 03:33:38.525]  Soros, it's all confirmed, they're funding it.
[03:33:38.585 --> 03:33:39.746]  It's all over drudge.
[03:33:39.826 --> 03:33:41.766]  It's breaking.
[03:33:42.386 --> 03:33:46.968]  He was just talking about how amazing it is spiritually, at a gut level, to be fighting this tyranny.
[03:33:47.008 --> 03:33:52.570]  So, Uncle Ted, if you could just repeat what you said during the break, that'd be amazing.
[03:33:53.240 --> 03:34:07.339]  Well, you know, it's simple to do, because I live the American dream with all my heart and soul, and I'm 70 years having the time of my life, so I appreciate freedom because I do so much work with the military and generous Americans who know that freedom is not free.
[03:34:08.059 --> 03:34:11.304]  And I'm having the greatest hunting season of my life.
[03:34:11.804 --> 03:34:21.249]  And every day we share a campfire with the heroes of the military and their families and children's charities, and the love and the positive spirit is over the top.
[03:34:21.709 --> 03:34:32.495]  And I think that God loves me a little bit more the more I fight for freedom and fight for His individual rights that He's provided us, and how the Founding Fathers wrote them down.
[03:34:32.915 --> 03:34:37.918]  I'm killing some great bucks with some beautiful, mystical flights of the arrow, and my point
[03:34:39.398 --> 03:34:40.999]  That this is a culture war.
[03:34:41.019 --> 03:34:42.541]  You've talked about it forever.
[03:34:42.581 --> 03:34:44.162]  You've raised hell forever.
[03:34:44.222 --> 03:34:51.608]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, the people listening, I know they clenched their fist and they shouted out loud, glory, glory, hallelujah.
[03:34:51.648 --> 03:34:53.809]  We the people experimenting in self-government.
[03:34:53.849 --> 03:34:58.193]  But there are people listening to us right now who don't vote.
[03:34:59.557 --> 03:35:03.159]  And Nancy Pelosi would like to thank you for not voting.
[03:35:03.640 --> 03:35:13.866]  Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Charlie Schumer and Eric Holder and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would like to thank all good Americans who don't vote.
[03:35:14.286 --> 03:35:19.089]  Because when you don't vote Constitution and logic and truth and common sense,
[03:35:19.609 --> 03:35:23.350]  You literally are voting for the Democrats who hate America.
[03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:28.971]  In the past, Alex, when we said how the Democrats hate America, people would say, oh, that's over the top.
[03:35:29.011 --> 03:35:31.612]  That rhetorical outrage is unacceptable.
[03:35:32.032 --> 03:35:39.994]  Now people are waking up that when you are angry at a president who says America first, you hate America.
[03:35:40.254 --> 03:35:41.634]  When you listen to the president
[03:35:42.443 --> 03:35:53.495]  ...proclaim his pride for being a nationalist, because I'm a nationalist, you're a nationalist, we are all nationalists, we believe in America, and then the media inserts the word, white!
[03:35:54.438 --> 03:35:56.940]  Alex, the president never said that.
[03:35:56.980 --> 03:35:58.401]  He said, I'm a nationalist.
[03:35:58.741 --> 03:36:06.006]  I love America, which means every ethnicity, every gender, every religion, every creed, every color, every walk of life.
[03:36:06.367 --> 03:36:12.471]  And the media goes berserk with their dishonesty to actually turn a loving
[03:36:16.766 --> 03:36:18.929]  It's Don Lemon and all those punks.
[03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:20.171]  Racists!
[03:36:20.592 --> 03:36:26.401]  So, this is the time to be radical because a cultural war is radical and freedom is worth it.
[03:36:26.862 --> 03:36:28.384]  Now is the time to vote.
[03:36:28.805 --> 03:36:32.030]  And if you've ever been suspicious or confused,
[03:36:32.905 --> 03:36:40.749]  If you do not vote Republican, you might as well wipe your ass with the Constitution because that's what the Democrats believe in.
[03:36:41.009 --> 03:36:43.311]  They don't believe in sanctuary for Americans.
[03:36:43.771 --> 03:36:47.593]  They believe in sanctuary for invaders of America.
[03:36:47.933 --> 03:36:54.598]  So I could go on, but I know I'm repeating the common sense, the truth, and the logic that you let loose every day.
[03:36:54.638 --> 03:37:10.368]  And again, we the people who are in the asset column, who make sacrifices and take risks and work our asses off to be of benefit to our family and our neighborhood, our country, the earth, the environment, our fellow man all over the world, when you're in the asset column, you're an asset for everybody!
[03:37:10.889 --> 03:37:14.391]  Beto O'Rourke wants you to be in the liability column!
[03:37:14.491 --> 03:37:15.452]  On fire, Ted Nugent.
[03:37:15.532 --> 03:37:17.173]  Ted, the few minutes we have left.
[03:37:44.298 --> 03:37:49.241]  The Democrats have come out and said, as you said, you can't even say we're a country that exists.
[03:37:49.721 --> 03:37:51.282]  You can't have mothers and fathers.
[03:37:52.222 --> 03:37:53.403]  Everything we do is bad.
[03:37:53.443 --> 03:37:54.403]  America was never great.
[03:37:54.423 --> 03:37:55.264]  It'll never be great.
[03:37:56.224 --> 03:37:57.945]  As I mentioned earlier, that's the governor of New York.
[03:37:58.005 --> 03:38:00.407]  These people are crazy.
[03:38:01.207 --> 03:38:05.830]  And I just can't believe they've got so many people to buy into their weirdness that it's neck and neck.
[03:38:06.650 --> 03:38:09.153]  And they're literally saying the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[03:38:09.213 --> 03:38:12.277]  Judge people about what they do and what they say and what they stand for.
[03:38:12.677 --> 03:38:15.701]  Like you listen to music, whether it's blacks playing it or whites playing it.
[03:38:16.081 --> 03:38:16.582]  We love it.
[03:38:16.822 --> 03:38:19.085]  If food's good, I don't care who owns the restaurant, I'm going there.
[03:38:19.646 --> 03:38:23.090]  And they turn around when we're the ones promoting classic Americana and they invoke...
[03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:35.882]  Race war, and they say kill our president all over the news, and they say we're the ones, and then they say Trump, who's pro-Israel, it's his fault some idiot went, some demon went and killed people.
[03:38:35.962 --> 03:38:37.702]  It just doesn't hold water.
[03:38:37.742 --> 03:38:38.523]  So let me ask you this.
[03:38:39.903 --> 03:38:45.664]  Gut level, I think if everybody goes and votes, we're still fighting a tsunami of fraudulent votes, but I still think we hold the House and Senate.
[03:38:46.044 --> 03:38:47.384]  What does the left do then?
[03:38:47.444 --> 03:38:51.405]  Because they are in war mode, and at a certain point,
[03:38:52.603 --> 03:38:54.024]  How do we respond to that?
[03:38:54.064 --> 03:39:06.954]  How does the President respond with tens of thousands of people marching up here, funded by the UN, to attack police and military to try to run over our border, and leftist groups shooing the President saying, you can't stop this.
[03:39:07.054 --> 03:39:08.615]  I mean, this is existential.
[03:39:08.836 --> 03:39:10.457]  They're making their move on the Republic.
[03:39:11.479 --> 03:39:14.582]  Well, I'll make it perfectly clear, and I know I echo what you believe in.
[03:39:14.642 --> 03:39:15.963]  I know what you're made out of, Alex.
[03:39:16.003 --> 03:39:17.765]  I know what your listeners are made out of.
[03:39:18.085 --> 03:39:22.549]  They're good, decent, law-abiding, conscientious, generous Americans.
[03:39:22.589 --> 03:39:27.434]  That's everybody in my band, my family, my brothers, my sisters, my crew, everybody around my campfire.
[03:39:27.754 --> 03:39:33.376]  All my fellow National Rifle Association members, we have a group called HunterNation.org.
[03:39:33.737 --> 03:39:41.740]  Everybody go to HunterNation.org and help us fight to get our private property and we the people's wildlife back in the control of science.
[03:39:42.260 --> 03:39:43.480]  HunterNation.org.
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:44.501]  But that's an example.
[03:39:45.221 --> 03:39:47.183]  We do not believe in violence.
[03:39:47.243 --> 03:39:48.524]  We denounce violence.
[03:39:48.824 --> 03:39:54.008]  I would protect Don Lemon from violence, even though he's a soulless punk.
[03:39:54.368 --> 03:39:55.249]  He's a liar.
[03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:56.229]  He's a racist.
[03:39:56.570 --> 03:40:00.893]  But I would protect him from violence, and I denounce all violence.
[03:40:01.693 --> 03:40:02.314]  However,
[03:40:03.081 --> 03:40:06.503]  We also believe in the right to self-defense.
[03:40:07.403 --> 03:40:27.953]  And I just did a special event with the Law Enforcement Heroes of America, so God bless law enforcement, God bless the military and the first responders, and we the people who are doing our moral, intellectual, and spiritual obligation as citizens of America to research the candidates, hold them to a constitutional fire,
[03:40:28.773 --> 03:40:31.997]  And vote to make America great.
[03:40:32.317 --> 03:40:37.483]  Constitutional, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, be the best that you can be.
[03:40:37.603 --> 03:40:43.069]  It's alive and well, but if we don't vote, the Democrats have lost their soul.
[03:40:43.450 --> 03:40:44.171]  They're just
[03:40:44.771 --> 03:40:46.073]  They have no bottom, Ted.
[03:40:46.093 --> 03:40:46.593]  They have no bottom.
[03:40:46.613 --> 03:40:47.834]  And I'm going to ask you this question next.
[03:40:47.934 --> 03:40:58.344]  We don't want violence with the 80-plus percent military-age men, with women using kids as shields, like Islamic terrorists, you know, with kids as suicide bombers.
[03:40:59.195 --> 03:41:03.459]  But Trump said they almost killed a couple of Mexican police and military.
[03:41:03.479 --> 03:41:04.480]  A few were in critical condition.
[03:41:04.500 --> 03:41:06.482]  They beat them over the head with clubs, firebombs.
[03:41:08.103 --> 03:41:11.406]  And Trump said, you throw big rocks at people, that's a deadly weapon.
[03:41:11.426 --> 03:41:12.207]  We're going to shoot back.
[03:41:12.908 --> 03:41:14.649]  That's not a violent call.
[03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:17.852]  If you're going to let them know they can come attack, they're going to do it.
[03:41:17.932 --> 03:41:21.495]  Tens of thousands of armed people using kids as shields coming up.
[03:41:22.136 --> 03:41:24.439]  Who are about to attack our border and our country.
[03:41:24.459 --> 03:41:26.823]  I mean, what is Trump supposed to do?
[03:41:26.923 --> 03:41:28.265]  I think that's a shot across the bow.
[03:41:28.585 --> 03:41:31.069]  He's being honest, saying, what do we do?
[03:41:31.129 --> 03:41:33.652]  Just sit there and let them throw bricks at the military and police?
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:35.541]  Well, I'll leave you with this, Alex.
[03:41:35.601 --> 03:41:45.086]  Thanks for letting me bring my voice and the voice of everybody I know, just great, great Americans across this country on your radio program and to share it on the airwaves of America.
[03:41:45.126 --> 03:41:46.087]  But let me leave you with this.
[03:41:46.207 --> 03:41:48.328]  I support President Trump's every move.
[03:41:48.768 --> 03:41:51.750]  I support President Trump in everything he does and says.
[03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:57.834]  We don't want someone presidential because the fake presidential guys got us into this mess.
[03:41:57.914 --> 03:41:59.094]  We want a hellraiser.
[03:41:59.354 --> 03:42:00.435]  We want a constitutional
[03:42:00.815 --> 03:42:02.976]  We want a we the people, earn your own way guy.
[03:42:02.996 --> 03:42:04.136]  That's what Donald Trump is.
[03:42:04.416 --> 03:42:05.457]  And I'll leave you with this.
[03:42:05.517 --> 03:42:20.041]  I'm on my way to my tree stand right now and I will kill more deer this year because the Hunters for the Hungry program has for 27 years donated 250 million hot meals of venison every year, Alex, to soup kitchens and homeless shelters.
[03:42:20.301 --> 03:42:24.742]  And I'll leave you with a couple of stanzas of the Democrats' new national anthem.
[03:42:24.762 --> 03:42:29.224]  My name is Ted Nugent and this is the Democrat National Anthem.
[03:42:40.676 --> 03:42:41.737]  Let me say bye to you, Ted.
[03:42:41.777 --> 03:42:43.059]  I've never heard you on fire.
[03:42:44.220 --> 03:42:47.424]  During the break, he said he'd shoot the best he's ever shot with a bow, so that's all I wanted to say.
[03:42:47.804 --> 03:42:49.206]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[03:42:49.246 --> 03:42:49.847]  Stay with us.

[03:43:25.526 --> 03:43:26.126]  But guess what?

[03:43:39.611 --> 03:43:41.312]  Support the InfoWars.

[03:43:58.257 --> 03:44:03.522]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:44:04.683 --> 03:44:11.429]  The globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:11.709 --> 03:44:14.131]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:14.792 --> 03:44:15.653]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:15.673 --> 03:44:20.017]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:44:20.057 --> 03:44:22.038]  I want to push all the way.
[03:44:22.999 --> 03:44:23.940]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:24.881]  I've prayed for that.
[03:44:25.441 --> 03:44:27.063]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:44:27.103 --> 03:44:28.664]  But you've got to back us.
[03:44:28.724 --> 03:44:30.105]  And I promise you this.
[03:44:30.966 --> 03:44:33.408]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[03:44:33.988 --> 03:44:35.109]  I will never falter.
[03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:37.731]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:44:38.011 --> 03:44:38.732]  I physically will.
[03:44:39.152 --> 03:44:45.918]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:44:57.135 --> 03:44:57.716]  Globalists.
[03:44:57.916 --> 03:44:59.340]  You know what a globalist is, right?
[03:44:59.621 --> 03:45:00.804]  You know what a globalist is.
[03:45:02.047 --> 03:45:02.768]  A globalist!
[03:45:03.755 --> 03:45:10.838]  Is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much.
[03:45:11.678 --> 03:45:12.218]  And you know what?
[03:45:12.258 --> 03:45:13.159]  We can't have that.
[03:45:13.639 --> 03:45:14.679]  You know, they have a word.
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:16.920]  It sort of became old-fashioned.
[03:45:17.260 --> 03:45:18.941]  It's called a nationalist.
[03:45:19.441 --> 03:45:20.362]  And I say, really?
[03:45:20.642 --> 03:45:22.142]  We're not supposed to use that word.
[03:45:22.182 --> 03:45:22.923]  You know what I am?
[03:45:23.083 --> 03:45:24.263]  I'm a nationalist, okay?
[03:45:24.303 --> 03:45:30.325]  I'm a nationalist.
[03:45:30.345 --> 03:45:30.565]  Nationalist.
[03:45:31.166 --> 03:45:31.506]  Nothing...
[03:45:33.745 --> 03:45:35.385]  Use that word.
[03:45:36.306 --> 03:45:41.569]  Use that word.
[03:45:42.049 --> 03:45:42.530]  Wow.
[03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:43.930]  I'm a nationalist.
[03:45:44.170 --> 03:45:45.611]  Nationalist.
[03:45:46.172 --> 03:45:46.492]  Wow.
[03:45:46.672 --> 03:45:47.512]  Use that word.
[03:45:48.053 --> 03:45:49.133]  Whoa.
[03:45:49.994 --> 03:45:52.215]  Did I just hear him say word country?
[03:45:53.156 --> 03:45:53.996]  Okay.
[03:45:55.457 --> 03:45:56.117]  Oh my god.
[03:45:56.738 --> 03:45:57.318]  Oh.
[03:45:59.531 --> 03:46:01.092]  We're going to talk about that word tonight.
[03:46:01.212 --> 03:46:07.295]  It is a favorite of the alt-right and is loaded with nativists and racial undertones.
[03:46:07.536 --> 03:46:10.817]  And globalists, well, globalists have been used as a slur.
[03:46:11.338 --> 03:46:13.319]  Trump says, nationalism.
[03:46:13.339 --> 03:46:14.580]  They'll go, mmm.
[03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:17.081]  Trump says, make America great again.
[03:46:17.181 --> 03:46:18.162]  Mmm.
[03:46:19.062 --> 03:46:23.625]  And it's like you're in junior high and the cool kids are trying to make you feel like
[03:46:24.980 --> 03:46:26.561]  You're stupid and you're not in the cool club.
[03:46:26.962 --> 03:46:28.043]  Like you're three years old.
[03:46:28.103 --> 03:46:31.386]  Like, do you want to stick your finger in the light socket?
[03:46:31.786 --> 03:46:32.507]  No.
[03:46:33.167 --> 03:46:35.309]  Do you want to eat out of the dog bowl?
[03:46:35.449 --> 03:46:36.711]  Yucky.
[03:46:37.772 --> 03:46:39.433]  Like you're talking to an 18-month-old.
[03:46:40.694 --> 03:46:44.598]  I mean, if anybody in this world is a dumbass dickhead, it's him.
[03:46:45.118 --> 03:46:46.700]  God, what an un-American piece of filth.
[03:46:55.848 --> 03:46:58.570]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.518 --> 03:47:19.761]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:20.481 --> 03:47:23.323]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.104 --> 03:47:27.805]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.845 --> 03:47:33.968]  Joel Gilbert coming to you for the rest of this hour from the People's Republic of California, looking for a big win.
[03:47:34.028 --> 03:47:39.211]  I'm predicting a big win for the Republicans on Tuesday for the midterms.
[03:47:39.592 --> 03:47:41.433]  But watch out for the Democrats.
[03:47:41.493 --> 03:47:42.713]  I just got this in the mail.
[03:47:43.154 --> 03:47:44.935]  Maxine Waters' sample ballot.
[03:47:44.975 --> 03:47:46.135]  There's the sample ballot.
[03:47:46.816 --> 03:47:49.137]  And she actually shows people how to vote.
[03:47:49.177 --> 03:47:52.259]  She checks for people, the actual
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:47:54.720]  Put an X in every single box.
[03:47:54.780 --> 03:47:58.181]  This is how Democrats feel about the electorate.
[03:47:58.201 --> 03:47:59.361]  They have to be told what to do.
[03:47:59.401 --> 03:48:00.082]  They're like sheep.
[03:48:00.622 --> 03:48:04.262]  They tell them, put your X right here, telling them how to vote.
[03:48:04.442 --> 03:48:11.544]  This is the low IQ, as Donald Trump says, Maxine Waters considers her constituents to be low IQ.
[03:48:11.964 --> 03:48:14.485]  So she's actually filling out the ballot for them.
[03:48:16.974 --> 03:48:17.974]  Anyway, look for a big win.
[03:48:17.994 --> 03:48:22.255]  I think Trump has proven over two years that he's going to bring the economy around.
[03:48:22.295 --> 03:48:23.495]  He cares about America.
[03:48:23.555 --> 03:48:27.356]  He's established the emotional bond with his Republican base.
[03:48:27.856 --> 03:48:30.617]  And I'm looking for a huge win on Tuesday.
[03:48:30.677 --> 03:48:35.878]  But watch out for the Democrats not accepting the results of democracy, as they did not in 2012.
[03:48:37.278 --> 03:48:40.039]  They took to the streets to protest democracy.
[03:48:40.079 --> 03:48:41.059]  Look for more of the same.
[03:48:41.079 --> 03:48:44.480]  I want to bring on Larry Klayman to talk about this
[03:48:45.589 --> 03:48:48.832]  Result of this horrific attack in Pittsburgh.
[03:48:49.012 --> 03:48:50.453]  I'm originally from Pittsburgh.
[03:48:51.033 --> 03:48:55.737]  When I was six years old, I used to go to the Tree of Life Synagogue, actually, in Pittsburgh.
[03:48:55.777 --> 03:48:58.780]  I remember it quite well, even though I was young.
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:01.702]  And I was shocked that there was no security there.
[03:49:02.843 --> 03:49:04.344]  Gun control doesn't matter anymore.
[03:49:04.364 --> 03:49:07.567]  Don't forget, Larry, people can print guns on your printer.
[03:49:07.767 --> 03:49:10.249]  So you take away all the guns and people are going to print them.
[03:49:11.983 --> 03:49:22.410]  Larry, you wrote an article about the Jewish left, saying that the leftist Jews are a danger to other Jewish people and even to Israel.
[03:49:22.971 --> 03:49:36.540]  Now, people today think of prominent Jewish leftists like Chuck Schumer, Dan Feinstein, Adam Schiff, Bernie Sanders, and even more embarrassing, some of the media like Dana Milbank from Washington Post and Jeff Zucker.
[03:49:37.578 --> 03:49:54.211]  CNN, but they don't know or realize, just like there are a lot of black conservatives, people identify today, black people with supporting Democrats, there are a lot of black conservatives, a lot of conservative Jews, all the way back to Barry Goldwater, of course big donors like Sheldon Adelson.
[03:49:55.292 --> 03:50:01.637]  Tell us about your piece, why these leftist Jews are a danger to the people.
[03:50:02.509 --> 03:50:04.170]  Well, let me say this, Joel.
[03:50:04.250 --> 03:50:05.350]  Like you, I'm Jewish.
[03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:06.270]  I'm Messianic.
[03:50:06.771 --> 03:50:08.551]  But I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage.
[03:50:08.631 --> 03:50:09.392]  I'm a Zionist.
[03:50:09.432 --> 03:50:09.952]  You know that.
[03:50:10.672 --> 03:50:11.873]  I believe in the state of Israel.
[03:50:12.413 --> 03:50:14.514]  And most Jews are not to the left.
[03:50:14.714 --> 03:50:17.115]  Most Jews are either conservative or moderate.
[03:50:17.775 --> 03:50:20.216]  And what's happening right now is the Jewish left.
[03:50:20.256 --> 03:50:22.177]  You see it in the universities, the professors.
[03:50:22.217 --> 03:50:25.698]  You see it on the cable networks like CNN, MSNBC.
[03:50:26.573 --> 03:50:31.276]  You see it with individuals like George Soros, who's not really, in his heart, Jewish at all.
[03:50:31.296 --> 03:50:33.817]  He's actually an anti-Semite in his own right.
[03:50:33.877 --> 03:50:35.598]  He's funding a lot of this activity.
[03:50:36.059 --> 03:50:43.823]  He and his dad actually took away property from Jews going to their deaths in concentration camps during World War II to save their own skin.
[03:50:43.843 --> 03:50:46.505]  I couldn't look at myself in the mirror after that.
[03:50:46.945 --> 03:50:50.107]  I would rather die in a concentration camp than sell out my own people.
[03:50:50.728 --> 03:50:54.670]  Well, here's what's happening, is that people are getting the wrong impression
[03:50:55.293 --> 03:51:15.130]  That Jewish people are against democracy, that they're against the Trump administration that was rightfully voted in to power, and even the lunatic like this neo-Nazi who killed 11 Jewish people at the synagogue that you used to attend to, cited Jewish people as the reason for bringing radical Muslim terrorists into this country.
[03:51:15.190 --> 03:51:15.651]  And you know what?
[03:51:16.412 --> 03:51:21.356]  Regrettably, there's some truth to that, because you have the Anti-Defamation League, which is very far left,
[03:51:22.337 --> 03:51:33.846]  They were actually aiding the Council for American-Islamic Relations, which has terrorist links, in opposing President Trump's greater degree of vetting of immigration from Muslim countries.
[03:51:33.886 --> 03:51:39.871]  Not all Muslims are terrorists, we know that, and we're not trying to ban all Muslims from the United States, but this was reasonable.
[03:51:39.911 --> 03:51:44.995]  And there you have these leftist Jewish groups that are in fact sowing the seeds of their own destruction.
[03:51:45.035 --> 03:51:47.257]  These people, if it had been
[03:51:48.206 --> 03:51:52.228]  After World War II, it's still getting on to boxcars, thinking that they were going to summer camp.
[03:51:52.828 --> 03:51:57.350]  They're not just naive, but they have a visceral hatred to conservatives.
[03:51:57.390 --> 03:52:00.472]  And we have to relate to what's happened to our black friends.
[03:52:00.512 --> 03:52:02.112]  I have many black conservative friends.
[03:52:02.233 --> 03:52:13.098]  One is Demetric Penny, a police officer in Dallas who brought a case against the ultimate anti-Semite, Louis Farrakhan, when Farrakhan incited death against his fellow police officers there.
[03:52:14.545 --> 03:52:19.388]  He was vilified, his Uncle Tom, a house end, everything else, his lives were threatened.
[03:52:20.028 --> 03:52:21.869]  So we Jews have to stand up.
[03:52:21.969 --> 03:52:22.829]  We don't stand for that.
[03:52:22.869 --> 03:52:30.013]  We are not Jews like Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Saul Alinsky, or the other people that you've mentioned.
[03:52:30.073 --> 03:52:31.974]  We believe in democracy.
[03:52:32.034 --> 03:52:33.054]  We believe in freedom.
[03:52:33.695 --> 03:52:37.957]  This land is our land, both here and in Israel, and most Jews are not
[03:52:38.627 --> 03:52:41.148]  radical leftists and that's unfortunately what's happening.
[03:52:41.188 --> 03:52:45.991]  So I'm forming a group and you're welcome to join and other Christians are welcome to join as well.
[03:52:46.771 --> 03:52:48.112]  Like I said, I'm a Jewish Christian.
[03:52:48.212 --> 03:52:49.512]  Let's bring everybody together.
[03:52:49.532 --> 03:53:03.279]  It's going to be called the Coalition of the Jewish Right and you can find that at freedomwatchusa.org because I'm sick and tired of seeing the Jewish left destroy the fabric of this country and we have to call it like it is.
[03:53:03.299 --> 03:53:04.880]  You and I can do it because we're both Jewish.
[03:53:05.430 --> 03:53:07.490]  But if someone else did it, they'd be called anti-Semitic.
[03:53:07.971 --> 03:53:10.851]  But the reality is, we have a problem within our own people.
[03:53:11.391 --> 03:53:14.672]  They're not only trying to destroy the fabric of American society, but of Israel.
[03:53:15.032 --> 03:53:15.212]  Yeah.
[03:53:15.652 --> 03:53:25.234]  Well, Larry, I think there's a big difference between Jewish people being, we have a lot of conservative Jews, probably most are conservative, we have people that are liberal.
[03:53:25.694 --> 03:53:33.036]  The thing that bothers me, and I find particularly distressful and embarrassing, is when people like Dianne Feinstein, Adam Schiff,
[03:53:33.836 --> 03:53:44.459]  Are just pathological liars that get on TV every day and lie about America, lie about Brett Kavanaugh, lie about the president.
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:54:01.665]  Do these Jewish leaders have a special responsibility to be at least be truthful and not try to disseminate lies and making their names associated with other Jewish people look bad?
[03:54:01.965 --> 03:54:03.165]  I find it embarrassing.
[03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:08.632]  Well, and you and I don't worry about appearances, you know, Joel, but here's the thing.
[03:54:08.712 --> 03:54:25.221]  I mean, after the massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue, it was Jewish leaders from that synagogue, Jewish leaders like Adam Schiff, to use the term leaders loosely, like Jake Tapper on CNN, who's also Jewish, and others who branded the president an anti-Semite.
[03:54:25.261 --> 03:54:27.943]  This is the most pro-Jewish president in modern history.
[03:54:28.603 --> 03:54:29.463]  He loves Israel.
[03:54:29.583 --> 03:54:32.525]  To the contrary, our last president, Obama, was an anti-Semite.
[03:54:33.146 --> 03:54:38.414]  He identified with his half-Muslim self rather than all of the people.
[03:54:38.594 --> 03:54:39.755]  In fact, I said that once.
[03:54:39.795 --> 03:54:40.677]  I was vilified for it.
[03:54:40.717 --> 03:54:41.418]  I said it on the mall.
[03:54:42.593 --> 03:54:46.255]  Mr. President, get up off your knees, put the Quran down, and come out with your hands up.
[03:54:46.316 --> 03:54:47.356]  I said that figuratively.
[03:54:47.376 --> 03:54:48.757]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:54:49.157 --> 03:55:03.266]  Obviously, you were being facetious, but Obama put this Iran deal in place, he snubbed Bibi Netanyahu, he was interested in Muslim outreach, and was very friendly with Israel's worst enemies, including Hamas.
[03:55:03.846 --> 03:55:08.969]  Whereas Trump, as they say, he's almost, like you said, Bill Clinton was the first black president, Trump is the first
[03:55:09.631 --> 03:55:18.934]  Jewish president because he moved the embassy to Jerusalem and he's so interested, he understands the dynamic in the Middle East and why Israel is an asset to U.S.
[03:55:18.954 --> 03:55:19.494]  security.
[03:55:20.534 --> 03:55:23.615]  That's what triggered it with me and that's why I'm speaking out and forming this group.
[03:55:23.635 --> 03:55:36.999]  That was the final straw that broke the camel's back, the Jewish camel's back I might say, because to actually attack the one president who is a friend of the Jewish people in modern history, I mean Jimmy Carter was no friend,
[03:55:37.765 --> 03:55:39.587]  And neither was Barack Obama.
[03:55:40.187 --> 03:55:47.553]  And someone who has moved that embassy to Jerusalem and to have leftist Jews call him an anti-Semite is the pot calling the kettle black.
[03:55:48.234 --> 03:55:52.297]  And I'm sorry to say it, but our people have disgraced our own people.
[03:55:52.417 --> 03:55:54.339]  And I don't consider these people Jews anymore.
[03:55:54.439 --> 03:55:55.159]  I really don't.
[03:55:55.700 --> 03:55:58.162]  Because they don't live by the tenets of the Ten Commandments.
[03:55:59.065 --> 03:56:09.391]  Well, we've seen this phenomenon in England and other far-left movements, the British Labour Party, where the far-left cozies up to the radical left and they become anti-semitic themselves.
[03:56:09.711 --> 03:56:14.974]  Is this what's happening to the Democrat Party despite having several prominent Jewish leaders?
[03:56:15.915 --> 03:56:16.375]  That's true.
[03:56:16.415 --> 03:56:21.918]  I mean, look at Bernie Sanders, who despises Israel, who disclaims his Jewish heritage.
[03:56:21.938 --> 03:56:25.520]  This is a guy who took his honeymoon in Moscow, okay?
[03:56:25.540 --> 03:56:27.221]  I mean, Moscow, the home of
[03:56:28.038 --> 03:56:28.959]  In effect, atheism.
[03:56:28.979 --> 03:56:31.881]  He worshipped the state rather than worshipping God.
[03:56:32.522 --> 03:56:34.243]  And he's just one example among many.
[03:56:34.323 --> 03:56:36.225]  Adam Schiff is an absolute disgrace.
[03:56:36.305 --> 03:56:38.607]  The congressman from West Hollywood.
[03:56:39.247 --> 03:56:42.229]  And he's somebody who, you know, lies through his teeth.
[03:56:42.250 --> 03:56:45.532]  And he got up there last Sunday with Jake Tapper and some others.
[03:56:45.832 --> 03:56:47.834]  Also, Tom Steyer from California.
[03:56:47.854 --> 03:56:48.735]  His dad was Jewish.
[03:56:49.295 --> 03:56:51.737]  And they just trashed Trump for being an anti-Semite.
[03:56:51.757 --> 03:56:52.398]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[03:56:52.538 --> 03:56:53.679]  They are the anti-Semites.
[03:56:54.292 --> 03:57:00.998]  Because they're the ones who are besmirching Judeo-Christian heritage, thought, and the religion.
[03:57:01.038 --> 03:57:02.379]  Because if you're a true Jew...
[03:57:03.451 --> 03:57:04.772]  You would never act this way.
[03:57:07.695 --> 03:57:08.996]  We only got a few seconds left.
[03:57:09.236 --> 03:57:24.590]  Larry, you're pointing out your starting organization called the Jewish Right, helping to point out that there are so many Jewish conservatives and patriots in this country, and not letting these radical leftists speak for Jewish people against the president.
[03:57:24.930 --> 03:57:25.891]  Well, thanks for being here.
[03:57:27.173 --> 03:57:28.756]  Go to freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:57:28.796 --> 03:57:30.861]  We had a short show today, but I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
[03:57:31.402 --> 03:57:34.008]  Everyone get out and vote, vote, vote!
[03:57:41.698 --> 03:57:47.423]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[03:57:47.723 --> 03:57:51.747]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[03:57:52.187 --> 03:57:54.389]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[03:57:54.429 --> 03:57:56.551]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[03:57:56.911 --> 03:57:58.913]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[03:57:59.433 --> 03:57:59.674]  Boom!
[03:57:59.954 --> 03:58:02.216]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[03:58:02.556 --> 03:58:04.117]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[03:58:04.177 --> 03:58:05.999]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[03:58:06.059 --> 03:58:07.180]  You still have a shopfront.
[03:58:07.380 --> 03:58:08.161]  And then what do we see?
[03:58:08.441 --> 03:58:09.202]  Washington Post.
[03:58:09.742 --> 03:58:12.884]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[03:58:14.245 --> 03:58:17.347]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[03:58:17.367 --> 03:58:20.209]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[03:58:20.509 --> 03:58:25.933]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:26.233 --> 03:58:33.238]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[03:58:33.558 --> 03:58:36.980]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[03:58:37.241 --> 03:58:39.462]  We're only funded by you by getting the products
[03:58:39.943 --> 03:58:46.510]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:48.412]  Victor, you're calling, go ahead.
[03:58:48.512 --> 03:58:49.954]  Yes, hi Alex.
[03:58:50.054 --> 03:58:56.281]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[03:58:56.481 --> 03:58:59.385]  I've ordered several of the products over and over.
