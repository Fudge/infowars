[00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:16.265]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:20.808]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:24.971]  Four days until the November 6, 2018 election.
[00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:59.461]  And we've got the United Nations officially, through its subgroups, suing Trump, and leftist federal judges standing by to claim we have no right to a border, and that the violent, armed, Molov cocktail-throwing hordes, spun up and created at UN command bases in Central and South America, have a right to smash through Mexican police, smash through the borders, and be trucked in
[00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:09.305]  to the United States to arrive literally, literally a day and a half to two days before the first group set to hit McAllen, Texas.
[00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:11.767]  This is unbelievable.
[00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:18.670]  And Jon Stewart goes on CNN to make jokes and goes, Trump acts like this is Road Warrior beyond Thunderdome.
[00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.931]  There's nothing happening anywhere.
[00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:24.153]  No, the French interior minister said that France is basically already collapsed.
[00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:28.956]  And if they don't reverse things now, they'll be gone in five years, civilization.
[00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:36.240]  Thousands of cars burned tonight in Sweden and Germany and in Spain.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.422]  Truck attacks, car murders, stabbings, acid attacks.
[00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:44.445]  Every country, sometimes seven a day is the average in England.
[00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:49.869]  It is just total carjacking, rape, murder, total insanity.
[00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.630]  Mexico's collapsed in most areas.
[00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.521]  And then they're telling you that everything is fine.
[00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:04.385]  Like you showed some video yesterday, Crew, where they're driving in Germany down the road at night and there's just dozens of burning cars as you're driving through them.
[00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:11.229]  I mean, this is the total insanity lawlessness with the millions of people coming in with the big snakes.
[00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:18.413]  And that's all the United Nations run and coordinated.
[00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:19.534]  Federal government funds it.
[00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.692]  Big banks chip in.
[00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:22.693]  It goes to the U.N.
[00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:23.753]  The U.N.
[00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:25.313]  gives it to the NGOs.
[00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:27.854]  Soros doesn't spend his own money.
[00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:30.514]  Soros doesn't do that.
[00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:34.855]  And by the way, what's the big ultimate sin?
[00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:42.037]  It's to say who is funding.
[00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.578]  Oh, Lou Dobbs might get fired.
[00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.118]  He had judicial watch on.
[00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:48.287]  And they said that the U.S.
[00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:49.789]  should cut funding off the U.N.
[00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:51.250]  because it's the group running it.
[00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the Veritas bombshell.
[00:02:54.813 --> 00:03:13.190]  They went into the Beto O'Rourke campaign at the level next to the very highest level, where they discussed the head of the campaign coordinating, siphoning off the record, now $80-something million that Beto has gotten from Hollywood and the globalists,
[00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:22.194]  To bring the Honduran caravans in that they talk about already being in Texas.
[00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:25.396]  One thing Michael Moore said that was true is he said, oh, these caravans are always coming.
[00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:30.119]  Yeah, they're getting more militarized, more out of control every day.
[00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.581]  James O'Keefe is joining us with world exclusive information at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:38.424]  We're going to be playing a lot of this footage, but guess what else?
[00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.684]  We have at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:47.488]  This really needs to go out worldwide because this isn't even hidden.
[00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:49.670]  But no one's covering this.
[00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.395]  UN MasterCard supplying migrants with prepaid bank cards.
[00:03:55.367 --> 00:04:00.291]  That's right, if you're an American patriot or pro-America or pro-gun, MasterCard won't let you bank online with them.
[00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:15.642]  But if you are armed, 80-plus percent military-age males that are throwing Molotov cocktails at police and putting people's eyes out, and you've got kidnapped kids with you, well then, they're absolutely all about it.
[00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:20.186]  This is from the United Nations itself.
[00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:22.007]  This is in a press release by the UNHCR.
[00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.523]  Meanwhile Trump's on TV saying, well I feel like Soros and the UN might be involved.
[00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:36.519]  That's because Trump knows the public isn't even ready for this.
[00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:39.922]  We are under world government corporate invasion.
[00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:45.166]  And if they break through with these groups, the next groups will be ten times bigger exponentially.
[00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.047]  It's all here.
[00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:46.768]  We have them.
[00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:50.931]  Oh, and guess who else Project Veritas found out is running Democrat campaigns?
[00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:53.033]  The CIA.
[00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.815]  Groups put behind by Obama.
[00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:56.796]  Oh!
[00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.376]  Oh!
[00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:58.037]  We'll be back!
[00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:09.596]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:12.459]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:18.505]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:25.430]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.736]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:38.661]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:39.802 --> 00:05:52.834]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:57.077]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:57.077 --> 00:05:59.780]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:26.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.741]  Four days.
[00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:31.321]  It's November 2nd, 2018.
[00:06:31.321 --> 00:06:34.262]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:37.343]  And this country is under coordinated
[00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:42.850]  Multinational combined cartel attack.
[00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:59.043]  The globalist shycomps, the unelected EU, the megabanks, the America-hating Hollywood propaganda corps, and giant third world populations already fed on by the globalists, now weaponized and turned into political engines of destruction.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:12.153]  And now, in hundreds of newspapers and on every comedy channel and on every late night comedy show, so many announcements, so many statements, I can't even watch them all.
[00:07:12.153 --> 00:07:20.963]  I've seen 30 plus articles today from the New York Times, the Washington Post, I've seen clips of Michael Moore on
[00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:33.323]  Nightly News and on late night shows saying white people are inherently bad and need to be removed from the face of the earth.
[00:07:33.323 --> 00:07:34.304]  Give up!
[00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:35.385]  Give up!
[00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:40.290]  Literally trying to invoke minorities who are 90% of the world population.
[00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.472]  Whites are minority globally.
[00:07:42.844 --> 00:07:55.916]  Weaponize and believe that literal, Hitler-level, race-based politics are good and whites are inherently bad.
[00:07:55.916 --> 00:08:00.460]  This is just staggering.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:09.547]  And you notice the progenitors, the leaders of this are almost exclusively white communists and socialists, who work for big megabanks, who are tax-exempt.
[00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:19.003]  All the big white billionaires all have tax-exempt schemes offshore and pay up to zero tax.
[00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:26.089]  Bono got in trouble only giving 0.8% of money he raised for Africans to them, so he went up to 1.1.
[00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.852]  98.9% of the billions goes right in his pocket.
[00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:31.394]  And I point that out
[00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:42.203]  Because you have to understand, these are monsters.
[00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:47.487]  If you look at where the most liberal people live, it is in the most white areas.
[00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.689]  They've done big national news stories, there's maps of it.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.002]  These people are crazy.
[00:08:54.002 --> 00:08:59.547]  Hillary Clinton said blacks are animals that must be made to heal and are super predators.
[00:08:59.547 --> 00:09:00.508]  Should I play the clip?
[00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:01.489]  You know, I think I will.
[00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:10.298]  But first, let's play Oprah Winfrey, the only black person, other than Vernon Jordan,
[00:09:12.193 --> 00:09:28.801]  Who is allowed in to the yearly eugenics meeting in New York City that David Rockefeller always chaired with Ted Turner and all the rest of them where they openly discuss race-specific bioweapons to wipe out Africans.
[00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:33.474]  This woman is a monster.
[00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:34.155]  You're like, but wait a minute.
[00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:35.636]  She wants to get the whites.
[00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:36.778]  I'll play a clip of her saying that.
[00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:38.319]  Whites need to all die.
[00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:39.580]  Get rid of these white people.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.241]  They need to die out.
[00:09:40.241 --> 00:09:41.422]  True white genocide statement.
[00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:45.986]  But then she really has a covert beyond the Nazi program.
[00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:50.271]  Because they're going after Europe and middle classes and uppity groups.
[00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:57.236]  That can undermine a hegemonic centralized control, a vertical integration.
[00:09:57.236 --> 00:10:05.965]  And then they target the third world, keep them de-industrialized, dumbed down, and then weaponize them racially and politically to come in and conquer the West.
[00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:10.169]  Then when the West is on its knees, burning, the bioweapons will be released.
[00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:18.703]  Within a matter of months, the world population will be reduced by 80% according to their operational guideline plans.
[00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:25.432]  I'm giving you the most classified information in the world right now, which you just were told.
[00:10:25.432 --> 00:10:29.197]  I can even give you places where they've slipped up and admitted it.
[00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:47.028]  And then I can give you the public admissions for their next level, below the actual command level, where they are given a false operational dogma that is still draconian, world population reduction, end of the family, we have to reduce world population through sterilization.
[00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:50.450]  That's the next level of need to know that it goes down from there.
[00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.112]  And you can see them now begin to propagandize the levels below that.
[00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:58.855]  Everything I told you about 20 plus years ago is now becoming mainstream and they're mainlining it to you.
[00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:04.322]  As they prepare to go operational.
[00:11:04.322 --> 00:11:10.506]  Trump is hated because he believes we can go to space and have a civilization and bring everybody up.
[00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:18.171]  But he's going to be tough with the third world populations and tough with other groups that have already been weaponized for everyone's survival.
[00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:22.494]  And he's going to be tough with the corrupt elites and the chi-coms and others.
[00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:26.397]  And he, along with a leadership group that's countervailing this,
[00:11:27.643 --> 00:11:32.775]  A believes you can't carry out this extermination and not have a nuclear war that comes as a side issue.
[00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.882]  And it's just too dangerous to even carry out the operation.
[00:11:36.877 --> 00:11:42.542]  Trump does not want to kill all the black people and all the Hispanics and all the Asians.
[00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:44.664]  He believes in unlimited expansion.
[00:11:44.664 --> 00:11:46.985]  So you're being given what's really going on.
[00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:54.792]  Oprah Winfrey goes to meetings with the top world leaders and even leaks that they're establishing world government to carry out forced population reduction.
[00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:56.133]  That's in the London Guardian.
[00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:57.614]  That's in the Associated Press.
[00:11:57.614 --> 00:11:59.055]  That's the plan.
[00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:02.959]  There is only two black people that are allowed in these meetings.
[00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:08.267]  With hundreds of billionaires.
[00:12:08.267 --> 00:12:12.269]  And then Michael Moore sits up there and says, whites are inherently bad.
[00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:14.771]  What's that got to do with whites?
[00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:17.472]  It's going to make them become super racist.
[00:12:17.472 --> 00:12:20.734]  And then they're all going to get persecuted.
[00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:26.237]  And then people will go along with this, but most whites are going to get wiped out as well.
[00:12:26.237 --> 00:12:32.261]  But you see, here's the larger operation.
[00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:33.982]  More and people know what they're doing.
[00:12:34.778 --> 00:12:44.702]  They want a ticket in the bunkers, luxury bunkers, swimming pools, shopping centers, everything that we built, the taxpayers.
[00:12:44.702 --> 00:12:46.803]  They want their golden ticket into those things.
[00:12:46.803 --> 00:12:49.725]  You're never going to get into those, Moore.
[00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:52.026]  Hillary, all of you, your plan's blown.
[00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:53.166]  You'll never pull it off.
[00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:56.447]  You'll never execute it.
[00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:59.349]  But you have to understand, Michael Moore is a monster.
[00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:02.688]  Oprah Winfrey is a monster!
[00:13:02.688 --> 00:13:06.810]  These are monstrous evil people!
[00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.631]  Trump has to first give America its identity.
[00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:10.011]  It's okay to have a country.
[00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:11.472]  It's okay to be proud of yourself.
[00:13:11.472 --> 00:13:15.254]  And then we're all together unifying around liberty and freedom and justice.
[00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:17.395]  Things that Martin Luther King totally agreed with.
[00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:19.576]  They have rejected that and overthrown it.
[00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:23.457]  But you have to destroy that idea by posing as if you're it.
[00:13:23.457 --> 00:13:26.819]  But if you actually look at it, it's 180 degrees the opposite.
[00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:35.950]  Michael Moore calls on angry white American guys to give it up because they're demographically doomed.
[00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:41.616]  See, they're making it about demographics, not about being Christian or being capitalist or being exceptionalist.
[00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:45.100]  They are fanatical about this because they know their time is up.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.226]  Oh, when the Republicans finally took over and ended Jim Crow and all that 40 years ago?
[00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:50.386]  Yeah.
[00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:53.138]  You guys are sick filth.
[00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:57.661]  He used to claim he represented poor white guys losing all their jobs up in Michigan and poor blacks.
[00:13:57.661 --> 00:13:58.742]  He doesn't now.
[00:13:58.742 --> 00:14:02.164]  The establishment hates blacks even more than they hate poor white people.
[00:14:02.164 --> 00:14:07.268]  And what you're getting is the total truth and everybody knows it deep down and you know it at your intellectual level.
[00:14:07.268 --> 00:14:10.790]  So remember, are we good enough to understand these monsters?
[00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.391]  Yes.
[00:14:11.391 --> 00:14:13.692]  That's why they're censoring us.
[00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:18.055]  Because we red pill more people than anybody but Trump.
[00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:20.237]  Now let's go ahead and play a clip of Oprah Winfrey.
[00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.551]  Sam, we need all these old white people to die.
[00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:24.151]  They're old.
[00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:24.812]  They're bad.
[00:14:24.812 --> 00:14:26.573]  That's Nazi talk.
[00:14:26.573 --> 00:14:27.414]  They're just all bad.
[00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:28.095]  We need them to die.
[00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:29.416]  Here it is.
[00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:33.699]  As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem's not solved.
[00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:43.787]  There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.
[00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:46.329]  They just have to die.
[00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:58.131]  Meanwhile, she meets with the most racist, hardcore leaders of the BioPort, of the Cold Springs Harbor, the people that founded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, that created Hitler.
[00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.432]  She is on the team.
[00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:03.892]  And it's just incredible.
[00:15:03.892 --> 00:15:12.674]  When we come back, Michael, the Pig Goblin, Moore, and others are just... The New York Times, everything, is just, whites are inherently evil, we gotta get rid of them.
[00:15:13.464 --> 00:15:16.507]  And it's not even good to be a friend with a white person.
[00:15:16.507 --> 00:15:19.390]  And then it's otherwise going, yes, you're right, we're inherently evil.
[00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:30.601]  This is the most Hitlerian bizarreness that anyone could ever imagine, and it just comes out of these ultra-rich, race-baiting, class-baiting trash.
[00:15:31.755 --> 00:15:39.400]  But see, they have trouble getting people to get into class warfare, because immigrants coming here want to become successful and independent and wealthy, or follow their dreams.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.964]  So the class warfare in working in Venezuela and everywhere else fails, so now they're just going to go, let's just go with race.
[00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:46.686]  Pure racial identity politics.
[00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:47.766]  It's in the WikiLeaks!
[00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:49.307]  We have their battle plans!
[00:15:49.307 --> 00:15:51.169]  And then now it's all over the news!
[00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:52.490]  They're trying to start a race war!
[00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.831]  Every movie, every show!
[00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:56.693]  These people are psychological terrorists!
[00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:01.074]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:06.456]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:09.358]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.358 --> 00:16:12.939]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:20.503]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:34.439]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:40.321]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:46.844]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:50.886]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:10.872]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.913]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:05.695]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.695 --> 00:18:16.964]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:26.788]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.788 --> 00:18:32.870]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.451]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:40.573]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:42.335]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.335 --> 00:18:52.302]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:54.944]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.944 --> 00:18:59.668]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:02.649]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:04.810]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.752]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[00:19:20.237 --> 00:19:29.361]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:49.618]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:19:49.618 --> 00:19:51.639]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:54.962]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:57.484]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:19:57.484 --> 00:20:03.368]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:26.136]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:27.480]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:43.732]  The reason I am the most deplatformed person in the world, and under unmitigated continual attack, is because I've done my research, I have the best sources, and I'm on target.
[00:20:43.732 --> 00:20:45.493]  And I believe in humanity.
[00:20:45.493 --> 00:20:47.074]  I believe in you.
[00:20:47.074 --> 00:20:52.817]  And so, we're laying out incredibly frightening information here.
[00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:54.078]  Because it's incredibly true.
[00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:57.320]  But it's not to scare you.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:06.965]  It's so that you know what's going on and you have a chance to speak out and get involved and outside the Hollywood mind control bubble and realize what's happening.
[00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:09.146]  They think you're stupid.
[00:21:09.146 --> 00:21:10.687]  That's an understatement.
[00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:22.794]  The UN openly in Europe and openly in Central and South America and North America has been running the breakdown plan has been running the breakdown plan
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:37.650]  To open up our borders and conquer nation-states by the UN controlling billions of unwashed, uneducated, violent, brainwashed, third-world populations.
[00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.770]  Period.
[00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.975]  Because the UN manages and runs these groups, because leftist groups manage and run these groups in the client countries.
[00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:50.219]  Once the UN gets them into your nation, they then control them.
[00:21:51.590 --> 00:22:18.204]  And of course, inside the Beto campaign, Project Veritas got the video of them saying, from the highest levels of the campaign, we are giving them credit cards, prepaid credit cards, everything, hiring them transportation, giving them food at every stop of the way, and they're already giving Hondurans, that's a code for Venezuelans, the aid packages when they got to the Texas border.
[00:22:18.204 --> 00:22:20.485]  And this was shot recently.
[00:22:21.749 --> 00:22:25.210]  There's already caravans in McAllen every day.
[00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:30.512]  Five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, we shot the video and showed the locals admitting it.
[00:22:30.512 --> 00:22:32.033]  We broke it.
[00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:35.894]  Drudge Report broke it nationally.
[00:22:35.894 --> 00:22:38.195]  So when I get up here and I say this is the U.N.
[00:22:38.195 --> 00:22:40.055]  and they go, oh my God, Jones is insane.
[00:22:40.055 --> 00:22:40.816]  He says the U.N.
[00:22:40.816 --> 00:22:42.136]  and Soros are involved.
[00:22:42.136 --> 00:22:47.278]  It's like saying that turkeys are involved with Thanksgiving.
[00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:53.398]  Or that football's involved with the NFL.
[00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:56.059]  Or that Superman wears a stupid red cape.
[00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:58.860]  I mean, this is... Now they're saying the caravan doesn't exist.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.621]  But that didn't work the last few days.
[00:23:00.621 --> 00:23:04.942]  So now they're saying, okay, there's always been caravans, and it's illegal to stop them.
[00:23:04.942 --> 00:23:07.443]  And the UN is funding lawsuits against Trump.
[00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:14.065]  And watch, you'll have some federal judges say, you've got to let them come on through and physically kill police and military and beard-guy over the head.
[00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:15.586]  And Trump's a terrorist.
[00:23:15.586 --> 00:23:18.507]  He can't put people in temporary tents before he ships them back.
[00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:18.987]  Which is Rex 84.
[00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:29.643]  Which the left spun, and I misunderstood 25 years ago when I was researching, was Reagan's plan for martial law and putting everybody in camps.
[00:23:29.643 --> 00:23:47.236]  No, it was the Communists had a plan, the Democrats they discovered, to trigger revolutions in Latin America and get Communists in, and then flood up with tens of millions of people collapsing the Southwest, and then causing riots, race-based riots nationwide, and Ronald Reagan said, that ain't happening, Jack!
[00:23:47.236 --> 00:23:48.457]  Get a plan ready to stop it!
[00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:53.930]  And Trump just implemented RECS 84.
[00:23:53.930 --> 00:24:00.113]  The UN and the globalists started all this.
[00:24:00.113 --> 00:24:01.794]  State of national emergency.
[00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:03.675]  What did I tell you?
[00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:12.720]  The day they smashed over the Mexican border and attacked the police, I said this is UN run and Trump will declare an emergency next Monday.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.003]  But the details will remain classified because these operations aren't classified.
[00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:26.065]  I don't think the UN and the traitors in our government, the stay-behind CIA networks, don't all know this information as well.
[00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:30.527]  So they know how to try to stop the Readiness Plan.
[00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:38.731]  That's why you better believe Trump isn't just going to go with the original plans to stop this UN communist invasion.
[00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:40.152]  They want to break our will.
[00:24:40.152 --> 00:24:41.553]  They want to break our borders.
[00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:45.775]  And you better believe John Brennan and Clapper and all of these dirtbags are behind it.
[00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:47.516]  And Brennan is commanding Beethoven.
[00:24:49.628 --> 00:24:52.151]  Brennan is his National Security Advisor.
[00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:55.155]  I can tell you that's secret information.
[00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:56.837]  But now it's not.
[00:24:56.837 --> 00:25:01.662]  And you notice that Beto is now quarterbacking the invasion point being Texas.
[00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:05.807]  They've chosen Southern California, but they want to have the clash.
[00:25:05.807 --> 00:25:07.129]  So they've chosen McCallum.
[00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:11.211]  Nobody needs to know.
[00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:15.996]  Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies for caravans and aliens.
[00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:25.385]  Hell, the UN just announced hundreds of millions MasterCards supplying migrants with UN funding with prepaid bank cards!
[00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:27.948]  NewsWars.com right now!
[00:25:29.107 --> 00:25:34.973]  Now, coming up, we're going to have the exclusive breakdown with the amazing James O'Keefe of Project Veritas.
[00:25:34.973 --> 00:25:35.753]  It was on his break.
[00:25:35.753 --> 00:25:40.738]  But here's some of the boil-down of the incredible footage they caught just days ago in Texas.
[00:25:40.738 --> 00:25:42.940]  Beto, under U.N.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:49.847]  command, working for Soros, breaching Texas's walls, literally assaulting us as an operative.
[00:25:49.847 --> 00:25:50.607]  Here it is.
[00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:53.510]  What's happening?
[00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.231]  What's happening?
[00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:10.767]  Thanks for the address.
[00:26:17.483 --> 00:26:21.006]  I think it's between me organizing rights and the campaign.
[00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:58.060]  I'm turning my attention to the lone star state, Congressman Beto O'Rourke, a rising Democratic star.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:04.543]  The kind of bitterness and name-calling, partisanship that has, unfortunately, defined so much of the national conversation.
[00:27:04.543 --> 00:27:10.087]  You can add more to it, or you can stay focused on the future and why you did this in the first place.
[00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:13.829]  We're not allowed to organize rides, and that's a huge, like, legal liability.
[00:27:13.829 --> 00:27:17.651]  So they wouldn't let us do that, like, until I just went around to this other email.
[00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:18.752]  Is there a documentation?
[00:27:20.614 --> 00:27:22.119]  Can I get a driver's license?
[00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:22.962]  Yeah.
[00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:24.246]  And then be nice.
[00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:25.811]  And then be confessional.
[00:27:29.622 --> 00:27:33.965]  I'm James O'Keefe here in El Paso, Texas, on the Mexico-United States border.
[00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:38.888]  Our latest investigation is on Beto O'Rourke, and this one is a blockbuster.
[00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:54.657]  These videos you're about to see appear to show Beto's campaign workers and staff, all the way up to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, knowingly using campaign resources and funds to help assist subsidized illegal aliens entering the United States.
[00:27:55.237 --> 00:27:57.239]  Some of them from the migrant caravan.
[00:27:57.239 --> 00:27:59.721]  Now, a lot of serious legal issues in this video.
[00:27:59.721 --> 00:28:05.685]  Section 1001 violations, FEC violations, a lot of serious questions that need to be answered.
[00:28:05.685 --> 00:28:09.849]  The voters of Texas are going to want those answers from Beto O'Rourke.
[00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:11.750]  Check this out.
[00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.712]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:15.453]  They're getting the real meat and potatoes there.
[00:28:15.453 --> 00:28:18.075]  The full videos, hours of it, are on Infowars.com.
[00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:20.077]  We're coming up with James O'Keefe on the other side.
[00:28:20.077 --> 00:28:21.698]  But here's the key.
[00:28:21.698 --> 00:28:24.100]  It's compartmentalized, and they've got this in more offices.
[00:28:25.097 --> 00:28:28.760]  You notice he's telling the low levels, oh, it's my idea, do this.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.881]  You know, here's the prepaid cards.
[00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:32.282]  Here's the food we're going to get them.
[00:28:32.282 --> 00:28:33.903]  And they ask, is this OK?
[00:28:33.903 --> 00:28:34.624]  He goes, oh, yeah.
[00:28:34.624 --> 00:28:35.965]  The head of the campaign knows.
[00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:36.545]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:41.149]  We have the UN press release about the prepaid credit cards and all of it.
[00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:42.750]  And I've been down to McAllen over and over again.
[00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.771]  This is treason by O'Rourke!
[00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:44.551]  Literal treason!
[00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.332]  He should be arrested!
[00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:01.960]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:10.060]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.764]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.764 --> 00:31:19.769]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:40.138]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.924]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:26.924 --> 00:33:32.288]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.288 --> 00:33:37.311]  He gets attacked, he gets lied about, he gets targeted, he gets sued, he gets arrested.
[00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:40.493]  It always falls to pieces because he's so effective.
[00:33:40.493 --> 00:33:45.997]  He's James O'Keefe and the heroes at Project Veritas, projectveritas.com.
[00:33:45.997 --> 00:33:49.420]  And he joins us to talk about one of the biggest
[00:33:50.427 --> 00:33:53.069]  Blockbuster bombshells I've ever seen.
[00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:56.452]  It's posted on InfoWars.com in a big Zero Hedge article.
[00:33:56.452 --> 00:33:57.733]  It's at Veritas.com.
[00:33:57.733 --> 00:34:00.555]  You've got to get it out to everybody.
[00:34:00.555 --> 00:34:11.724]  Separately, our reporting from a UN press release, bizarrely enough, at NewsWars.com and EuropeWars, shows the UN and Visa giving them prepaid credit cards.
[00:34:11.724 --> 00:34:12.465]  So it's confirmed.
[00:34:12.465 --> 00:34:13.345]  And the UN's funding it.
[00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:13.866]  That's admitted.
[00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:28.571]  But here's James O'Keefe showing that the main invasion point is going to be McAllen, Texas, where Obama used to have the buses come in by the dozens every few hours and bring in whole families, whole groups of individuals.
[00:34:28.571 --> 00:34:33.255]  The Washington Post reported many end up being put into sex smuggling.
[00:34:33.255 --> 00:34:34.596]  And Trump says, no, we have a border.
[00:34:34.596 --> 00:34:35.716]  We check people coming across.
[00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:40.040]  So here's this rampaging mob coming up and they undercover inside
[00:34:41.038 --> 00:34:51.366]  The Beto O'Rourke campaign have found devastating information that absolutely must sink O'Rourke.
[00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:55.529]  And if it goes all the way to the top, which of course we know it does, he really should be indicted and arrested.
[00:34:55.529 --> 00:34:57.891]  This isn't just violating campaign finance law.
[00:34:57.891 --> 00:35:00.713]  This is literally being a Benedict Arnold.
[00:35:00.713 --> 00:35:01.814]  Thank you for joining us, James.
[00:35:01.814 --> 00:35:02.935]  You've only got eight minutes.
[00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:03.835]  You've got the floor.
[00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.857]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:09.820]  This is a pretty amazing video, and you know we've been releasing videos
[00:35:10.464 --> 00:35:12.366]  The last two weeks on different races.
[00:35:12.366 --> 00:35:17.493]  Yesterday in Florida, Gillum fired his staffer for saying Florida is a cracker state.
[00:35:17.493 --> 00:35:21.918]  So when they say that our videos are fake, well they fire the people that we featured in the video.
[00:35:21.918 --> 00:35:23.981]  I'm not the source of this information.
[00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:26.024]  They are the source of this information.
[00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:26.845]  So in Texas,
[00:35:27.512 --> 00:35:29.132]  This is last night.
[00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:31.813]  We just confirmed yesterday morning.
[00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:33.694]  I'm actually in El Paso right now.
[00:35:33.694 --> 00:35:40.016]  We just confirmed this Jody Casey is the campaign manager for a beta award.
[00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:43.997]  It's a hundred million dollar operation now because they raised all this money.
[00:35:43.997 --> 00:35:52.079]  She told our undercover reporter not to worry about using campaign funds to pay for the illegal migrant.
[00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:54.660]  This after her staff was on tape.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:04.686]  Saying that they have to lie, mask, break the law in violation of campaign finance law to use the funds to pay for the monument.
[00:36:04.686 --> 00:36:08.688]  So we have the campaign manager on tape saying, don't worry about doing it.
[00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:12.351]  And we have the staffers on tape doing it and talking about doing it.
[00:36:12.351 --> 00:36:14.472]  This is not my proposition.
[00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:16.133]  I did not bait them.
[00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.535]  They volunteered this information to us.
[00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:21.665]  When they did not know they were being recorded, Alex.
[00:36:21.665 --> 00:36:31.672]  So now I went to confront the campaign manager, Jody, Casey is her name, and she gave me no comment when I took my camera out and asked her about the videos.
[00:36:31.672 --> 00:36:33.013]  Has this become a phenomenon?
[00:36:33.013 --> 00:36:39.617]  The videos have become a phenomenon and they're viral right now, but we're looking for a response from Beto.
[00:36:39.617 --> 00:36:41.038]  This is incredible.
[00:36:41.038 --> 00:36:44.221]  I need every person in America, not just every Texan, listening.
[00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:51.036]  To go to InfoWars.com and get the Zero Hedge article, because I think it's one of the best and has it all laid out.
[00:36:51.036 --> 00:36:54.959]  Go to ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:36:54.959 --> 00:36:56.100]  Go to ZeroHedge.com.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.081]  I don't care where you go.
[00:36:57.081 --> 00:37:03.286]  Go get the articles and email them, text message them to 50 people.
[00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:07.510]  You want to beat these folks in a war to destroy our country, that's what it is.
[00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.611]  The UN is running this.
[00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:10.953]  Soros is running this to break down Europe, to break down the US.
[00:37:10.953 --> 00:37:11.953]  It's their admitted plan.
[00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:26.774]  When they've got this socialist globalist married to a billion dollar lady, always these rich limousine liberals trying to destroy our country, trying to bring in these criminals, it's up to everyone to get these videos out.
[00:37:27.984 --> 00:37:34.827]  But again, as you just said, James O'Keefe, trying to get Beto O'Rourke to respond, our listeners shouldn't wait.
[00:37:34.827 --> 00:37:36.867]  Don't wait for InfoWars or Veritas to do it.
[00:37:36.867 --> 00:37:43.510]  You must all go to his campaign stops, wherever you are, with a camera, with your cell phone, and bring this up to this monster.
[00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:49.592]  Everyone must go peacefully confront this Benedict Arnold, because we know these orders are coming from the top.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:58.062]  Alex, one of the people, one of the readers, probably one of your readers, actually called up the El Paso newspaper this morning.
[00:37:58.062 --> 00:38:06.005]  And because they made the phone call to the local paper in El Paso, the El Paso media is now assigning a report to the story.
[00:38:06.005 --> 00:38:15.008]  So the only way that we're going to really get accountability, and this is a violation of campaign finance law, this is a very big deal, what they're on tape saying and doing here.
[00:38:16.212 --> 00:38:29.899]  They're relying on forms, on federal forms, using prepaid cards, their word, not mine, they're calling them prepaid debit cards, cash disbursements to pay for the migrant caravan people.
[00:38:29.899 --> 00:38:30.880]  This is against the law.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.063]  So you guys calling up the local media in Texas and saying, have you guys seen this?
[00:38:36.063 --> 00:38:36.783]  You guys covering it?
[00:38:36.783 --> 00:38:45.548]  That can make a huge difference because the only way Beto is going to be forced to respond is if his friends at the Texas Tribune and others are asking him tough questions.
[00:38:46.018 --> 00:38:48.219]  That's right, and let's be absolutely clear here.
[00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:50.799]  You've got your lawyers that check all this.
[00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:53.020]  It clearly violates campaign finance law.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.180]  He's saying, hey, it's coming from the head campaign person, it's okay.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:09.304]  They're falsifying forms, and then they're giving money to people that have traversed our border illegally and other borders illegally, and they are aiding and abetting groups that have been caught smuggling children, human trafficking.
[00:39:09.304 --> 00:39:14.625]  So this is illegal on so many fronts, and then if you've got Beto and his campaign being advised by Brennan
[00:39:15.565 --> 00:39:23.013]  And this is the Democratic Party literally coordinating to flood our borders and create a civil emergency.
[00:39:23.013 --> 00:39:25.236]  Yeah, they've raised so much money.
[00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:27.178]  I don't even know what the number is now.
[00:39:27.178 --> 00:39:30.401]  I'm guessing it's at least $80, if not $100 million.
[00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.242]  No, you're right.
[00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:32.423]  It was $87 million two days ago.
[00:39:32.423 --> 00:39:33.665]  They now estimate it's over $100 million.
[00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:40.715]  So it's a hundred million dollars that they've raised, and just so everyone knows who Jody Miller is, she talks to Beto every day.
[00:39:40.715 --> 00:39:42.195]  She is the campaign manager.
[00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:43.556]  I'm a field organizer.
[00:39:43.556 --> 00:39:46.977]  The other two people we have on paper are field organizers.
[00:39:46.977 --> 00:39:51.378]  These are the troops of a campaign that administer day-to-day activities.
[00:39:51.378 --> 00:39:53.818]  Jody actually manages the entire operation.
[00:39:53.818 --> 00:39:55.479]  She runs the whole campaign.
[00:39:55.919 --> 00:40:00.824]  And the fact that she's in the video saying, don't worry that this is happening.
[00:40:00.824 --> 00:40:10.392]  The fact that the field organizers, Dominique and this woman named Reyes, are on tape saying that there are text messages that prove Jodi knows about it.
[00:40:10.392 --> 00:40:13.155]  This is a big deal.
[00:40:13.155 --> 00:40:14.616]  This may be the biggest thing we've ever done.
[00:40:14.616 --> 00:40:16.257]  And don't take my word for it.
[00:40:16.257 --> 00:40:18.459]  I've had Dinesh D'Souza text me today.
[00:40:18.459 --> 00:40:20.021]  I've had Dana Lash text me.
[00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:22.183]  I've had all these people texting me saying this is
[00:40:22.773 --> 00:40:36.480]  It's such a big story, and I hope that all this comes out in a couple days before the election, but it requires all of you listening right now, share this video to everyone that you know.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.401]  It's the only way that we're going to get accountability.
[00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:47.778]  And I cannot stress to people enough, the UN came up with a plan 20 plus years ago with Peter Sutherland who died this year.
[00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.459]  It's all, they wrote books about it.
[00:40:49.459 --> 00:40:54.984]  To build these migrant bases, to build these leftist refugee camps where they brainwash them for sometimes up to a year.
[00:40:54.984 --> 00:41:03.651]  Then they bring them into your country, leftist groups get them, go sign them up for welfare, anchor babies, and the Democrats extract part of the money off of them to build an infrastructure
[00:41:04.432 --> 00:41:13.600]  out of our welfare state and then they go to totally implode the borders as France's internal minister just said, France is on the verge of collapse.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.042]  Thousands of fires a night, murders, deaths.
[00:41:16.042 --> 00:41:27.171]  This is 21st century warfare being directed by multinationals and what you and your crew have done is give us the total proof and the victory but now everyone must move the ball down the field
[00:41:28.157 --> 00:41:29.639]  Real fast and then we have left.
[00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:31.281]  Please give us updates over the weekend.
[00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:35.125]  Monday I'm going to be doing seven days a week live here, obviously the next four days.
[00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.527]  I will Alex.
[00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.470]  The truth is manifestly damning.
[00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:42.434]  The truth is not, I'm not the source of this business and we'll keep this credit historically.
[00:41:43.354 --> 00:41:46.637]  I didn't selectively edit anything, and I put my credibility on the line on this.
[00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.118]  I've got 12 lawyers.
[00:41:48.118 --> 00:41:49.499]  I will go under oath.
[00:41:49.499 --> 00:41:51.321]  These recordings are real.
[00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:52.521]  It's not my words.
[00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:54.043]  You can see the lips moving.
[00:41:54.043 --> 00:41:56.024]  They always change the subject.
[00:41:56.024 --> 00:41:56.925]  You destroyed Akron.
[00:41:56.925 --> 00:41:58.486]  You've devastated all their operations.
[00:41:58.486 --> 00:41:59.307]  You exposed Hillary.
[00:41:59.307 --> 00:42:03.951]  You have taken us over the line to win, and so have the audience.
[00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:05.652]  All of us together are on a team.
[00:42:05.652 --> 00:42:07.814]  Other big bombshells coming in the next four days, James?
[00:42:08.697 --> 00:42:10.338]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:42:10.338 --> 00:42:14.820]  Let's let this one play out today and see if we can get some comments from Beto.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.181]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:42:16.181 --> 00:42:19.663]  Again, ProjectVeritasAction.com.
[00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:22.424]  Visit ProjectVeritasAction.com.
[00:42:22.424 --> 00:42:26.326]  Folks, InfoWarsArmy, everybody, peacefully in information warfare.
[00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:27.287]  Infiltrate these groups.
[00:42:27.287 --> 00:42:28.327]  Come back over the weekend.
[00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:34.651]  I want to hear about how you guys have infiltrated this Democrat CIA operation with your own spy and how they're crapping their britches.
[00:42:37.011 --> 00:42:40.193]  James O'Keefe, ladies and gentlemen, I am so excited right now.
[00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:44.717]  We come back, we'll go over more of the video that he's talking about and what's happening.
[00:42:44.717 --> 00:42:49.540]  The articles are on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.341]  Get them.
[00:42:50.341 --> 00:42:51.402]  Get them out.
[00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.403]  Nobody needs to know.
[00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:55.565]  Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies.
[00:42:55.565 --> 00:42:56.666]  Caravan aliens.
[00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:57.887]  Of course, that's what they're doing.
[00:42:59.249 --> 00:43:08.555]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.555 --> 00:43:11.437]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.437 --> 00:43:17.461]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:24.384]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:30.687]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.687 --> 00:43:37.610]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:51.796]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:56.038]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.038 --> 00:43:58.739]  X3, now available at mploreslife.com.
[00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:03.280]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:10.343]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:44:10.343 --> 00:44:15.164]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[00:45:01.434 --> 00:45:09.977]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.
[00:45:09.977 --> 00:45:13.459]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[00:45:23.002 --> 00:45:29.405]  I know from using this myself the last few months and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being
[00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:30.685]  We're good to go.

[00:46:56.071 --> 00:47:03.813]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:03.813 --> 00:47:06.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.394 --> 00:47:22.575]  You found it.
[00:47:22.575 --> 00:47:25.638]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:25.638 --> 00:47:27.720]  It's the Infowar.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.242]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.242 --> 00:47:32.143]  This is not a spectator sport.
[00:47:39.227 --> 00:47:44.154]  The entire Democratic Party works for multinational tax-exempt foundations.
[00:47:44.154 --> 00:47:49.221]  They created the UN to transfer national power into their own coffers.
[00:47:49.221 --> 00:47:51.845]  They have organized the collapse of the third world.
[00:47:51.845 --> 00:47:52.986]  They have weaponized them.
[00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:55.750]  They have taught the third world to hate America.
[00:47:56.511 --> 00:47:58.852]  They have taught them to hate white people.
[00:47:58.852 --> 00:48:00.592]  Now most of them don't down in those countries.
[00:48:00.592 --> 00:48:01.972]  They see through the communists.
[00:48:01.972 --> 00:48:12.135]  But they take the worst of the communists, the worst of the dumbed down, they organize them, they train them, and they fund them each step of the way so they don't take the big paycheck and run off.
[00:48:12.135 --> 00:48:16.996]  They get paid up to a thousand dollars per leg.
[00:48:16.996 --> 00:48:20.717]  This is all public UN operations.
[00:48:20.717 --> 00:48:23.798]  And now you see the next leg funded by the UN
[00:48:26.129 --> 00:48:40.642]  And funded by MasterCard, mainstream news, press release from the UN, at the Texas leg in McAllen and in El Paso.
[00:48:40.642 --> 00:48:46.187]  This is a civil war inside of our country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:46.187 --> 00:48:51.372]  And then, they play dumb, and if you mention George Soros is involved, his Open Society Foundation,
[00:48:52.657 --> 00:48:56.900]  He gets taxpayer money through the UN, then he has his little criminal NGO do it.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:05.246]  They call you anti-Semite, then Louie Gohmert had to go on Lou Dobbs Last Night and say it's not racist to say that George Soros is funding it.
[00:49:05.246 --> 00:49:07.728]  No, it's not racist to say that the sky is blue.
[00:49:07.728 --> 00:49:10.750]  But that's the level of how dumb they think you are.
[00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:16.714]  It all rests on you not knowing that these are giant invasion forces.
[00:49:16.714 --> 00:49:19.837]  In the last six years, they've brought 15 million.
[00:49:24.147 --> 00:49:34.776]  Military-age men out of North Africa and out of the Middle East, the worst of the worst of those countries, and the burning and the raping and the killing is unbelievable.
[00:49:34.776 --> 00:49:39.800]  The Interior Minister of France said yesterday, we are collapsing.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.984]  We must start now to reverse this or we will not have a civilization.
[00:49:43.984 --> 00:49:46.566]  Within five years, we will be a failed state.
[00:49:47.981 --> 00:50:01.186]  Yes, if you import a failed state into your country, and the left teaches them to hate you, it's called 21st century warfare!
[00:50:01.186 --> 00:50:04.987]  Listen, understand, there's not rhetoric strong enough to say what's going on.
[00:50:04.987 --> 00:50:06.108]  How would you take down America?
[00:50:06.108 --> 00:50:07.468]  Not with nuclear weapons.
[00:50:07.468 --> 00:50:08.609]  You'd kill yourself.
[00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:09.229]  You wouldn't take it?
[00:50:09.229 --> 00:50:10.830]  No, you want to capture it.
[00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.831]  So you bring the third world you've already enslaved in
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.862]  And you have Michael Moore say white people are inherently bad?
[00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:23.526]  You have Don Lemon say they're inherently bad?
[00:50:23.526 --> 00:50:27.709]  Even the UN admits persecution of Christians doubled about 10 years ago.
[00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:29.831]  It doubled again the last few years.
[00:50:29.831 --> 00:50:33.554]  And the Islamists are killing millions of their own people a year.
[00:50:33.554 --> 00:50:40.539]  But Don Lemon says that white males are the most violent group in the world and shows some fake pie charts.
[00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:53.484]  No, the least violent group in the world are Japanese people.
[00:50:53.484 --> 00:50:57.965]  And then you go down the line from there.
[00:50:57.965 --> 00:51:04.007]  Whites are like number three in the world under groups on average for lowest crime rate.
[00:51:04.007 --> 00:51:06.107]  That's a fact, everybody knows it.
[00:51:06.107 --> 00:51:14.569]  But again, the idea that we're all guilty and we're bad, so then everyone has to come in and then these weird, big, fat, neurotic white people
[00:51:16.357 --> 00:51:22.940]  Sit there and look at the demographic numbers and say, we'll just turn them all into racists, and then they'll come after everybody.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:33.024]  So what headline do I come up with, with James O'Keefe pleading with you to get the videos at InfoWars.com out to everybody?
[00:51:33.024 --> 00:51:43.369]  I'm gonna take that video, I'm gonna put it out, I'm gonna say, Beto O'Rourke caught generaling, quarterbacking, the US invasion leg,
[00:51:45.694 --> 00:51:49.977]  Democrats on the border, planning to fight U.S.
[00:51:49.977 --> 00:51:55.100]  military and border patrol and aid armed invaders, and Beto's at the center of it!
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.480]  Really?
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.221]  No kidding?
[00:51:56.221 --> 00:52:00.684]  A leftist globalist?
[00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.886]  With Brennan as his advisor?
[00:52:03.886 --> 00:52:05.587]  Of course!
[00:52:05.587 --> 00:52:14.913]  You don't just think the Democrats now poured, it is now over a hundred million, a hundred million, the most expensive Senate campaign ever, outspending Ted Cruz three to one,
[00:52:16.175 --> 00:52:19.520]  You don't just think that money accidentally got sent down here.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.645]  It's all coming out of multinationals.
[00:52:22.645 --> 00:52:24.828]  It's out of China's subsidiaries.
[00:52:24.828 --> 00:52:26.410]  It's all illegal.
[00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:29.315]  And no one ever prosecutes the Democrats.
[00:52:29.315 --> 00:52:31.418]  They commit whatever crimes they want.
[00:52:35.632 --> 00:52:37.434]  I am speechless at this point.
[00:52:37.434 --> 00:52:40.377]  We've got hours and hours of video up on Infowars.com.
[00:52:40.377 --> 00:52:47.764]  But what do I call that last segment of James O'Keefe begging you to take action?
[00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:52.948]  And I know you've been taking action, but you've got to hammer your entire phone list.
[00:52:53.689 --> 00:53:04.344]  There's ways to get into your phones, depending on what type it is, and you can put an InfoWars.com link to Beto Bombshell's new viral video show, Staffers Use Campaign Funds Illegally Aid Migrant Caravan.
[00:53:04.344 --> 00:53:04.944]  Of course!
[00:53:04.944 --> 00:53:07.608]  They've been funding it every step of the way!
[00:53:07.608 --> 00:53:07.949]  U.S.
[00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:10.252]  money has from the Democrats that they stole from taxpayers.
[00:53:13.035 --> 00:53:14.276]  How do you describe that?
[00:53:14.276 --> 00:53:15.396]  How do you deal with that?
[00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:19.178]  They just have the mainstream media up there going, Trump's an evil man.
[00:53:19.178 --> 00:53:21.119]  He's going to hurt the little children they're trying to come up.
[00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:23.980]  Meanwhile, show the footage of them throwing rocks at U.S.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.341]  helicopters.
[00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:31.063]  And Trump, the dramatic footage, we even got to that last night in the speech, very powerful.
[00:53:31.063 --> 00:53:33.164]  He said, yeah, if you throw rocks at the military, we're going to shoot you.
[00:53:35.342 --> 00:53:37.724]  And what that is, is not a call for violence.
[00:53:37.724 --> 00:53:42.108]  He's telling these mainly military-age men, a lot of them on video, saying, yeah, I can't wait.
[00:53:42.108 --> 00:53:42.709]  I got deported.
[00:53:42.709 --> 00:53:43.369]  I'm going back to the U.S.
[00:53:43.369 --> 00:53:44.470]  to kill more cops.
[00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.931]  That's a quote.
[00:53:46.087 --> 00:53:51.672]  He's telling these military-age men, you will be treated as military operatives.
[00:53:51.672 --> 00:53:52.533]  Let's play that clip in a moment.
[00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:53.794]  Let's play that first.
[00:53:53.794 --> 00:54:04.644]  You will be treated, you're a bunch of tough guys, you ran through the police, you ran through the military, you've shown you're in a man's world, you hold up kids in front of you while you do it.
[00:54:04.644 --> 00:54:08.107]  We've seen that with the Palestinians and the Islamicists, you little dirtbags.
[00:54:10.253 --> 00:54:13.197]  And so you do that up front, we're putting you on notice.
[00:54:13.197 --> 00:54:17.343]  That's called a shot across the bow.
[00:54:17.343 --> 00:54:19.206]  That's a warning.
[00:54:19.206 --> 00:54:20.668]  The first one's free.
[00:54:20.668 --> 00:54:22.070]  You better be glad we're giving it to you.
[00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:40.130]  And I'm telling you, it's time for these out-of-control criminals like Brennan and O'Rourke and all these people trying to destroy our country and trying to bring in a third-world population they control and they suck off of as a permanent underclass to know that they are going to be brought to justice.
[00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:44.391]  And Trump has put out an image saying, after the election, sanctions.
[00:54:44.391 --> 00:54:48.372]  It isn't just a message to Iran.
[00:54:48.372 --> 00:54:49.672]  It isn't just a message to Iran.
[00:54:54.099 --> 00:54:56.860]  It's a message to all you criminals.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:02.503]  That you have pushed so far, you people are so crazy, and it's our fault for not putting you in your place.
[00:55:02.503 --> 00:55:06.846]  Sanctions are coming.
[00:55:06.846 --> 00:55:09.187]  November 6th.
[00:55:09.187 --> 00:55:09.647]  Get ready.
[00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:18.072]  Isn't Trump a bad man for standing up for our country in its darkest hour?
[00:55:18.072 --> 00:55:20.533]  We should just collapse into Venezuela and let the U.N.
[00:55:20.533 --> 00:55:21.533]  run us.
[00:55:21.533 --> 00:55:22.833]  We don't need a civilization.
[00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.694]  Only elites behind big armored walls.
[00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:27.174]  How dare Trump be so bad?
[00:55:27.174 --> 00:55:28.895]  Hollywood cares about us.
[00:55:28.895 --> 00:55:30.335]  The Rockefellers care about us.
[00:55:30.335 --> 00:55:35.097]  The Chi-Coms care about us.
[00:55:35.097 --> 00:55:36.877]  Trump's standing up for this country.
[00:55:36.877 --> 00:55:38.538]  This country's been totally sold out by traitors.
[00:55:38.538 --> 00:55:42.379]  It's like Ulysses coming home after being gone for 30 years.
[00:55:42.379 --> 00:55:43.699]  You traitors are in big trouble.
[00:55:44.673 --> 00:55:46.294]  So read your Iliad.
[00:55:46.294 --> 00:55:52.840]  Let's go to the President talking about we'll fire on those trying to kill people with rocks, just like they do in the Middle East.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.681]  Here it is.
[00:55:53.681 --> 00:56:07.272]  But I will tell you this, anybody throwing stones, rocks, like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico, we will consider that a firearm.
[00:56:07.272 --> 00:56:10.175]  Because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.
[00:56:11.704 --> 00:56:18.166]  Which, as you know, that was very violent a few days ago, very, very violent.
[00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:20.567]  That break-in, it was a break-in of a country.
[00:56:20.567 --> 00:56:23.288]  They broke into Mexico.
[00:56:23.288 --> 00:56:30.450]  And you look at what's happening in Guatemala, just to mention Guatemala along with El Salvador and Honduras.
[00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:36.453]  It's disgraceful that those countries aren't able to stop this, because they should be able to stop it before it starts.
[00:56:36.453 --> 00:56:40.174]  And the United States, we're seeing civilization level collapse.
[00:56:41.175 --> 00:56:45.096]  And our president is on fire to defend this republic.
[00:56:45.096 --> 00:56:47.276]  He loves the mission.
[00:56:47.276 --> 00:56:54.118]  And we've barely gotten a few hundred troops in place so far, and the left is filing suits trying to stop them, saying we have no right to a border!
[00:56:54.118 --> 00:57:03.540]  And there come the people that eat your pension fines, and to be used up by the system and used by permanent underclass by the left who want slaves.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:12.548]  They're all fleeing Venezuelan communism, and they're coming here waving their foreign flags, and we're going to do that again here.
[00:57:12.548 --> 00:57:14.030]  Please don't forget we're listener supported.
[00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:17.013]  When you get t-shirts, books, films, it makes what we do here possible.
[00:57:18.112 --> 00:57:20.993]  And please don't forget we have the very best supplements out there.
[00:57:20.993 --> 00:57:30.676]  We have developed an even better iodine with a deep-earth crystal source and two other types and a tiny bit of vitamin C that keeps it from oxidizing to be even better than X2.
[00:57:30.676 --> 00:57:34.278]  It's ultimate iodine, 50% off, out of the gates and pre-shipping.
[00:57:34.278 --> 00:57:36.558]  I want you to see how amazing it is.
[00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:40.120]  X3 Survival Shield exclusively at InfoWarsLives.com.

[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.440]  Whatever you do,
[00:57:44.602 --> 00:57:47.988]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:59.733]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:57:59.733 --> 00:58:02.395]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:06.699]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:58:06.699 --> 00:58:14.206]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:58:14.206 --> 00:58:16.608]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[00:58:20.046 --> 00:58:22.248]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:58:22.248 --> 00:58:23.128]  They called it U.N.
[00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:24.750]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:25.290]  2030 Agenda.
[00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:37.219]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:38.780]  It's the David Knight Show!
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:41.823]  Never miss your show, any day.
[00:58:41.823 --> 00:58:43.003]  I mean, what?
[00:58:43.003 --> 00:58:43.804]  I mean, never!
[00:58:50.543 --> 00:58:56.586]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.586 --> 00:58:59.507]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[00:59:53.382 --> 00:59:56.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.131 --> 01:00:14.533]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[01:00:14.533 --> 01:00:16.554]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.554 --> 01:00:21.116]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:21.116 --> 01:00:25.058]  Jody, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas Action.
[01:00:25.058 --> 01:00:25.518]  How are you?
[01:00:25.518 --> 01:00:33.962]  Hi, we have your campaign staffers on tape admitting to using campaign money to pay for migrants.
[01:00:33.962 --> 01:00:35.122]  And I just have to ask you,
[01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:40.792]  Well, we already have you on tape.
[01:00:40.792 --> 01:00:43.234]  This is your campaign workers.
[01:00:43.234 --> 01:00:44.815]  I'd like to get your comment, ma'am.
[01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:45.216]  Thank you.
[01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:46.937]  I said no comment.
[01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:48.759]  Well, this video is about to go public.
[01:00:48.759 --> 01:00:58.447]  It just made me really concerned because I know that we're using some of the campaign resources to help with the migrants.
[01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.609]  And I just didn't want anyone to get in trouble with that.
[01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:05.833]  I didn't want them to ask me any questions about people using resources.
[01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.226]  Um, those are kind of questions.
[01:01:14.226 --> 01:01:15.127]  They said it was fine.
[01:01:15.127 --> 01:01:16.107]  I need to see this.
[01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:16.848]  Oh my, okay.
[01:01:16.848 --> 01:01:17.268]  I told you.
[01:01:17.268 --> 01:01:17.628]  Yeah.
[01:01:17.628 --> 01:01:18.809]  I have the message to prove it.
[01:01:38.844 --> 01:01:44.627]  Andrea Reyes says that she would tell you, they're not advertising it, they're using campaign funds to pay for- I have no comment.
[01:01:44.627 --> 01:01:46.968]  Well actually you did comment, you're in the video right here.
[01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:48.849]  I'll play you, there you are.
[01:01:51.872 --> 01:01:53.954]  He said don't worry about using campaign resources.
[01:01:53.954 --> 01:01:55.356]  It's a violation of section 1001.
[01:01:55.356 --> 01:01:57.739]  It's an FEC violation.
[01:01:57.739 --> 01:01:59.120]  Do you have any comment?
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:06.589]  Excuse me, do you have any comment?
[01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.931]  Alright guys, we'll see you on the internet.
[01:02:09.884 --> 01:02:15.486]  Well, you just saw Jody, the campaign manager, repeatedly saying she doesn't have a comment.
[01:02:15.486 --> 01:02:18.006]  We have all their people on video.
[01:02:18.006 --> 01:02:19.087]  There's nothing much to say.
[01:02:19.087 --> 01:02:23.208]  The video speaks for itself, and now they'll have to answer for it.
[01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:31.690]  Reporting outside of the Beto campaign headquarters in El Paso, Texas, is James O'Keefe from Project Art Dons Action.
[01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.631]  Obama ran the open board.
[01:02:34.631 --> 01:02:37.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:37.592]  Obama
[01:02:39.997 --> 01:02:42.658]  Instead, let in whoever can come to the border.
[01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:46.340]  This has been going on for six, seven years.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:51.483]  And now Trump's trying to stop it, so they act like it's not going on.
[01:02:51.483 --> 01:02:54.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, we come back from break.
[01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.085]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:02:56.085 --> 01:03:02.828]  The only other place it is, is at Mastercard's website.
[01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:08.191]  They officially brag that they are working with the UN to fund the migrant invasion
[01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:09.802]  With $1,000 per league.
[01:03:09.802 --> 01:03:10.103]  $1,000 per leg.
[01:03:17.259 --> 01:03:26.661]  Some of these people have gone up to six legs from Venezuela and are now on the final leg of the Venezuelan invasion force.
[01:03:26.661 --> 01:03:28.842]  We're calling them Hondurans.
[01:03:28.842 --> 01:03:30.382]  That's the last country they smashed through.
[01:03:30.382 --> 01:03:33.723]  By the time they get here, they'll call them Mexicans.
[01:03:33.723 --> 01:03:40.205]  Almost all of them are Venezuelans and Hondurans waving their own flags and declaring the destruction of our nation.
[01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:47.609]  Screaming, down with the USA, burning American flags, because they're who the UN organized.
[01:03:47.609 --> 01:03:49.354]  So of course, Beto O'Rourke.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:56.366]  And his campaign offices are like, to the low levels, is it alright to give him money and all this stuff?
[01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:59.890]  Well, of course it's okay to give him prepaid credit cards.
[01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:02.253]  I talked to the higher-ups, they say it's alright.
[01:04:02.253 --> 01:04:03.514]  It's meant to be compartmentalized.
[01:04:03.514 --> 01:04:07.379]  Like, does Don Corleone know we're running whorehouses?
[01:04:07.379 --> 01:04:08.820]  No, the Don doesn't know.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.861]  Well, then I'm not going to do it.
[01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:11.143]  Well, the Don said it was alright.
[01:04:13.925 --> 01:04:16.107]  It's called compartmentalization, need to know.
[01:04:16.107 --> 01:04:17.768]  It's all right here.
[01:04:17.768 --> 01:04:18.849]  Look at this.
[01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:21.931]  UN MasterCard supplying migrants with prepaid bank cards.
[01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:25.213]  That is europe.infowars.com.
[01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:26.814]  It's linked up on infowars.com.
[01:04:26.814 --> 01:04:29.596]  But look, people are like, oh yeah, right, Alex Jones.
[01:04:29.596 --> 01:04:32.378]  It's been unearthed.
[01:04:32.378 --> 01:04:34.040]  Look at this, unearthed.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:39.984]  Officially, MasterCard and George Soros to explore private sector solutions to societal challenges.
[01:04:39.984 --> 01:04:41.025]  That was in January.
[01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:44.424]  Eleven months ago.
[01:04:44.424 --> 01:04:48.868]  Oh Soros, he's not involved and it says he's directly funding with MasterCard the U.N.
[01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:50.849]  operation with taxpayer money.
[01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:54.472]  And here it is from MasterCard.
[01:04:54.472 --> 01:04:55.653]  From the MasterCard website.
[01:04:58.516 --> 01:05:02.759]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:05:02.759 --> 01:05:06.241]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:08.003]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:11.285]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:18.069]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:23.153]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[01:05:23.473 --> 01:05:29.599]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:32.581]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:32.581 --> 01:05:33.682]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:33.682 --> 01:05:37.386]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:37.386 --> 01:05:39.508]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:39.508 --> 01:05:40.809]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:40.809 --> 01:05:41.890]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:43.552]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:43.552 --> 01:05:45.954]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:46.454 --> 01:05:47.574]  I will never falter.
[01:05:47.574 --> 01:05:50.115]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:50.115 --> 01:05:51.055]  I physically will.
[01:05:51.055 --> 01:06:11.380]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at folklorestore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.200]  Coming up, I'm going to open the phones.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.381]  In fact, I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:21.830]  It's the bottom of the hour, and I'm gonna go to your call on these big subjects.
[01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:25.671]  That's right.
[01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:29.313]  We are back live here, four days out.
[01:06:29.313 --> 01:06:34.695]  When you study this, and you know basically every angle of it, and you turn on the news,
[01:06:35.836 --> 01:06:39.838]  Or you read the New York Times and it says George Soros is not involved with the U.N.
[01:06:39.838 --> 01:06:41.998]  George Soros is not involved with open borders.
[01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.859]  George Soros is not involved with the migrant caravan.
[01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:45.840]  No one's funding it.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.481]  It's all by itself.
[01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:53.803]  And then you can pull up Forbes, AP, Reuters, Dallas Morning News.
[01:06:53.803 --> 01:06:58.485]  This year, George Soros is going, I'm helping the poor migrants with the U.N.
[01:06:58.485 --> 01:06:59.205]  and we're funding it.
[01:07:00.779 --> 01:07:07.541]  So it's a positive article, they admit he's doing it, but if we say it's wrong or illegal to be doing this human smuggling, they go, we're not doing anything!
[01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:11.301]  In fact, there's not even caravans.
[01:07:11.301 --> 01:07:13.362]  But then Michael Moore told the truth in a twisted way.
[01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:17.543]  He said, these caravans have been going on for many years.
[01:07:17.543 --> 01:07:21.104]  That's right, there's caravans already smashed across.
[01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:22.544]  The Border Patrol can't stop them.
[01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:24.865]  They're outgunned, 100 to 1.
[01:07:24.865 --> 01:07:30.146]  In Beto O'Rourke's so-called town, where he carpetbags, in El Paso,
[01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:46.394]  And there's the Project Veritas video on Infowars.com going viral right now of Beto O'Rourke's campaign people admitting that they're giving them the prepaid credit cards and food and bus tickets and everything else to go to the next destination.
[01:07:46.394 --> 01:07:46.994]  What do they say?
[01:07:46.994 --> 01:07:54.756]  Catholic Charities and other, well we call them churches and then the guy laughs.
[01:07:54.756 --> 01:08:00.798]  The left then manages the groups they bring in, put them in cheap housing and then milk the welfare off of them.
[01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:20.286]  They'll then put them in factories working, owned by Democrats, in towns they control where there's no inspection, and then they don't even give them their paychecks, and they tell them, you don't complain about this or we'll have you shipped back to Venezuela.
[01:08:20.286 --> 01:08:21.487]  This is all on record.
[01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:22.847]  This is how the Democrats work, folks.
[01:08:22.847 --> 01:08:27.708]  They bring in really poor Muslim groups and have them work in factories.
[01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:30.229]  It's always run by a liberal Muslim who's over it.
[01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:34.672]  Very, very, very sick.
[01:08:34.672 --> 01:08:40.758]  These are sick, exploitive, evil people that will destroy what middle class and economy we have.
[01:08:40.758 --> 01:08:43.761]  This is their plan.
[01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:49.467]  And it is mind-boggling that we've gotten to this point.
[01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:52.490]  And you've got the illegal alien invaders, the military, it's men all over.
[01:08:53.697 --> 01:09:14.566]  Burning, and killing, and attacking, and blocking roads, and carjacking, and the French domestic minister, interior minister said yesterday, we have already collapsed in many cities, civilization is gone, the roads aren't working, everything is collapsing, if we don't start now, stopping this, we will collapse completely in five years.
[01:09:14.566 --> 01:09:19.988]  That's... red alert, red alert, red alert!
[01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.189]  This is the plan!
[01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:43.720]  The multinationals are collapsing the first world to bring in a new age of total tyranny, where there's a huge group of poor people and a tiny group of owners, and all the big tech heads and all the big elites pay no taxes, and they fund race-based politics everywhere.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.304]  And now, hundreds of times worse than I've ever seen,
[01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:54.359]  Every globalist paper is, whites are inherently an evil group.
[01:09:54.359 --> 01:10:05.608]  Whites must be genocided, whites must be removed, whites are the problem, and it's always big, giant, evil, fat demons, like Michael Moore, who are white.
[01:10:05.608 --> 01:10:08.590]  New York Times, should I give up on white people?
[01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:11.232]  White people are the number one terror threat in the world.
[01:10:11.232 --> 01:10:13.754]  White people, I mean, I've got all these clips.
[01:10:13.754 --> 01:10:18.198]  Oprah Winfrey, we need to get rid of, kill all these, all you old white people that need to just die!
[01:10:20.555 --> 01:10:28.422]  But she's meeting at the most elite UN global secret meetings for world population reduction, and her job is to target Africans.
[01:10:28.422 --> 01:10:29.883]  These are sick people, folks.
[01:10:29.883 --> 01:10:32.585]  They're targeting everybody.
[01:10:32.585 --> 01:10:34.907]  Oh, but look!
[01:10:34.907 --> 01:10:45.716]  Texas Voter Info, Beto O'Rourke gets almost half of his donations from Soros, Act Blue, according to federal documents.
[01:10:45.716 --> 01:10:46.217]  Here's another one.
[01:10:48.615 --> 01:10:54.800]  Cash Assistance Empowers Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Greece.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.547]  That's officially from the European Union's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Group that brings in the invaders and brainwashes them.
[01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:05.990]  UN Mastercard Supplying Migrants with Prepaid Bank Cards.
[01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.690]  Where did we get this?
[01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:09.653]  At newswars.com?
[01:11:09.653 --> 01:11:12.195]  Or did Dan Lyman, with the great work he does, get that?
[01:11:12.195 --> 01:11:12.996]  He got it from...
[01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:18.152]  Mainstream news.
[01:11:18.152 --> 01:11:23.598]  Oh, from MasterCard itself in press releases.
[01:11:23.598 --> 01:11:33.550]  MasterCard and George Soros to explore, this was nine months ago, private sector solutions to societal challenges.
[01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:34.151]  Oh, and look.
[01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:37.983]  There it is, World Refugee Day.
[01:11:37.983 --> 01:11:39.344]  Mastercard.com.
[01:11:39.344 --> 01:11:40.204]  Here, zoom in.
[01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:43.206]  Mastercard.com.
[01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:55.014]  It says they're working all over the world, from North Africa to the Middle East, to Central and South America, North America, on track to support the migrants.
[01:11:55.014 --> 01:12:02.039]  They always show a little girl, not military age men, raping or burning your house down, or burning your car up.
[01:12:02.039 --> 01:12:05.021]  Coming to help you have flexibility and dignity.
[01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:07.536]  They don't want to help in their own third world country.
[01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:09.058]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.799]  They're going to bring them here and they're going to control them.
[01:12:10.799 --> 01:12:16.785]  MasterCard prepaid debt cards provide refugees with mobility, flexibility, and dignity.
[01:12:16.785 --> 01:12:19.247]  And we're just from MasterCard.com.
[01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:20.848]  And guess who they listed here?
[01:12:20.848 --> 01:12:29.756]  George Soros, who they say isn't involved in anything.
[01:12:29.756 --> 01:12:31.578]  No, no, he didn't do anything.
[01:12:34.246 --> 01:12:41.012]  New York Times, Alex Jones must be taken completely off the air for defaming George Soros.
[01:12:41.012 --> 01:12:42.293]  Insane!
[01:12:42.293 --> 01:12:43.734]  He's funding open borders.
[01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:44.875]  Wow, that's just insane.
[01:12:44.875 --> 01:12:46.757]  He's only in thousands of interviews saying it for 25, 30 years.
[01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:51.195]  And of course, Beto.
[01:12:51.195 --> 01:12:51.995]  Beto.
[01:12:51.995 --> 01:12:52.395]  Peto.
[01:12:52.395 --> 01:12:53.496]  Whatever his stupid name is.
[01:12:53.496 --> 01:12:54.437]  Beta male.
[01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:55.197]  Globalist.
[01:12:55.197 --> 01:12:57.359]  He's married to a billionaire heiress.
[01:12:57.359 --> 01:12:58.259]  He's filthy rich.
[01:12:58.259 --> 01:12:59.880]  His mother's a famous Democrat.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.142]  He gets up and says, my mother's a Republican.
[01:13:02.142 --> 01:13:03.923]  100% pure lies!
[01:13:03.923 --> 01:13:05.544]  But he did tell the truth.
[01:13:05.544 --> 01:13:11.148]  He said, I think we need to ban all of the semi-automatic rifles.
[01:13:13.647 --> 01:13:14.608]  He hates you.
[01:13:14.608 --> 01:13:18.031]  He just lives to destroy Texas.
[01:13:18.031 --> 01:13:19.372]  They hate strength.
[01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:20.173]  They hate honor.
[01:13:20.173 --> 01:13:21.354]  They hate will.
[01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:26.199]  They don't want to bring in migrants and get them into America and make them love America and we love them.
[01:13:26.199 --> 01:13:36.148]  They want to poison them with leftist venom while he gets up to the public and tells them,
[01:13:39.002 --> 01:13:41.324]  Sounds like a cross between Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama.
[01:13:41.324 --> 01:13:42.204]  He's a joke.
[01:13:42.204 --> 01:13:43.705]  He's a hit-and-run criminal.
[01:13:43.705 --> 01:13:44.826]  He's a fraud.
[01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:58.935]  He's the enemy of this country, and he's been caught lying on federal forms to take campaign money from all sorts of multinational groups and then give it to human smugglers.
[01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:03.458]  Human smugglers!
[01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:06.540]  We just put up with the Democrats, let them do whatever they want, so why shouldn't they?
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.601]  They're gonna steal, steal big!
[01:14:09.258 --> 01:14:12.762]  George Soros Mastercard to partner to aid migrants and refugees.
[01:14:12.762 --> 01:14:12.923]  Reuters!
[01:14:12.923 --> 01:14:13.704]  2017!
[01:14:13.704 --> 01:14:16.347]  Almost two years ago.
[01:14:24.397 --> 01:14:26.618]  Right after Trump gets elected, Reuters.
[01:14:26.618 --> 01:14:46.003]  But I tell you this, Trump tells you this, oh that he's funding them with these cards and cash, and we track the groups back, that it's him publicly, it's not even hidden, and they just go, man I tell ya, we gotta do something about the right-wing lie machine, yeah that Lou Dobbs needs to get fired, that Matt Drudge is evil, yeah Trump's crazy, he said that there's a group bringing him in.
[01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:48.844]  That's preposterous!
[01:14:51.594 --> 01:15:06.401]  Thousands of articles with George Soros bragging that he overthrew the elected government and put Nazis in Ukraine who literally Heil Hitler.
[01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:09.422]  How did you feel working to round up the Jews with your godfather?
[01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.302]  I felt nothing.
[01:15:10.302 --> 01:15:12.643]  It was happy making time.
[01:15:12.643 --> 01:15:14.264]  Actually, it was the best time of my life.
[01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:16.605]  Do you feel any guilt?
[01:15:16.605 --> 01:15:17.425]  No.
[01:15:17.425 --> 01:15:19.346]  Actually, I feel no guilt.
[01:15:19.346 --> 01:15:20.627]  It's quite nice, actually.
[01:15:21.744 --> 01:15:27.246]  How dare Jones talk about him, the Holocaust survivor, that he helped the Nazis?
[01:15:27.246 --> 01:15:29.027]  There's nothing that Jones won't do!
[01:15:29.027 --> 01:15:33.909]  Oh my gosh!
[01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:36.970]  New York Times yesterday, huge article.
[01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.190]  The right wing's crazy!
[01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.871]  They think Soros has power!
[01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:46.334]  He gave $32 billion this year to crush America.
[01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:48.655]  Can American red blood and common sense beat $32 billion?
[01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:54.181]  The Republicans aren't even spending a billion on the whole campaign.
[01:15:54.181 --> 01:15:56.163]  They got us outnumbered 30 plus to 1.
[01:15:57.856 --> 01:15:59.056]  Hear that?
[01:15:59.056 --> 01:16:04.438]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.438 --> 01:16:07.338]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:10.919]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.919 --> 01:16:18.501]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:16:23.082 --> 01:16:25.523]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:33.838]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.838 --> 01:16:36.879]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.879 --> 01:16:42.801]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.801 --> 01:16:46.603]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:47.863]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.863 --> 01:16:49.204]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:55.406]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.406 --> 01:16:56.847]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.507 --> 01:17:02.310]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:08.174]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.221]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:02.221 --> 01:19:05.502]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.502 --> 01:19:11.764]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.764 --> 01:19:14.545]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:19.108]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.108 --> 01:19:25.574]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.574 --> 01:19:30.538]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.202]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.202 --> 01:19:42.406]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.406 --> 01:19:47.629]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:53.332]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.332 --> 01:19:57.294]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.388 --> 01:20:09.835]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.835 --> 01:20:23.446]  See, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:20:29.039 --> 01:20:33.461]  It's hard to turn music that pretty off, isn't it?
[01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:44.125]  I've actually read the history books that even had scans in them of big broad page newspapers in England 250 years ago.
[01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:45.445]  240 years ago.
[01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:46.946]  200 years ago.
[01:20:46.946 --> 01:20:49.787]  And they were worried about one group.
[01:20:49.787 --> 01:20:58.030]  They weren't worried about the French, or the Spanish Empires, the Portuguese Empires, or the Dutch Empire that they were back and forth fighting with, usually allied with the Dutch.
[01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:04.214]  They were worried about Napoleon, you know, some during that period.
[01:21:04.214 --> 01:21:09.978]  But they were worried about the American system.
[01:21:09.978 --> 01:21:15.642]  Because they said, if you let everybody not have to get government licenses, you don't have to be a lord under the royal system.
[01:21:15.642 --> 01:21:23.787]  If everybody can go out and be prosperous, all the invention, all the science, everything's going to come out of this country.
[01:21:23.787 --> 01:21:24.228]  When the U.S.
[01:21:24.228 --> 01:21:28.711]  was only like 20 years old, it was already so successful that everyone was jealous of it.
[01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:38.372]  Except strangely enough, historically, there was this weird thing, because the Czars were using competition with the British Empire, so they kind of liked the U.S.
[01:21:38.372 --> 01:21:41.975]  And the French did as well, but that was mainly playing empires off against each other.
[01:21:41.975 --> 01:21:48.079]  But they talked about the American system, and we've got to, quote, strangle it in its crib.
[01:21:48.079 --> 01:21:54.024]  I mean, why does everybody want to get here, if it's so bad?
[01:21:54.024 --> 01:21:59.328]  Because we had a little more freedom, a lot more freedom in some cases than other places, to innovate.
[01:22:00.799 --> 01:22:06.763]  If you were born in Italy, 200 years ago, 100 years ago, if you weren't from the right class, you went nowhere.
[01:22:06.763 --> 01:22:11.747]  You didn't have a chance to get out of what your family had been for thousands of years.
[01:22:11.747 --> 01:22:13.789]  And it's the same thing all over the world.
[01:22:14.778 --> 01:22:16.599]  It's like that in Japan.
[01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:19.321]  It's like that in everywhere.
[01:22:19.321 --> 01:22:22.783]  And America had this idea, and the idea spread.
[01:22:22.783 --> 01:22:26.006]  People didn't wear jackets like this and outfits like this.
[01:22:26.006 --> 01:22:27.226]  People didn't have universities.
[01:22:27.226 --> 01:22:28.767]  They didn't have three branches of government.
[01:22:28.767 --> 01:22:31.229]  They didn't have the way Supreme Courts are set up and everything.
[01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:32.110]  We did that!
[01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:33.330]  We did it!
[01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:34.551]  We did it!
[01:22:34.551 --> 01:22:36.593]  And it didn't take militaries or anything
[01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:40.871]  to enforce that.
[01:22:40.871 --> 01:22:41.771]  It was better.
[01:22:41.771 --> 01:22:42.652]  It worked better.
[01:22:42.652 --> 01:22:48.914]  Everyone imitated it because everyone imitates success.
[01:22:48.914 --> 01:22:49.614]  Now, fast forward.
[01:22:49.614 --> 01:22:50.515]  We've become decadent.
[01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:52.795]  We've become corrupt.
[01:22:52.795 --> 01:23:00.778]  We've been infiltrated by really bad groups that want to use our power to project power, but at the same time are fearful of the power that it might rise again.
[01:23:00.778 --> 01:23:07.761]  And these sick, evil monopoly men have to be dealt with.
[01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:14.887]  And everything we're dealing with now is the overhang of the Robber Baron's attempt.
[01:23:14.887 --> 01:23:22.751]  About 120 years ago, they had full page articles in Banking Digest that I've read on air and shown you years ago.
[01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:27.454]  I need to go back through all the stuff I used to do over a decade ago just proving this stuff existed.
[01:23:27.454 --> 01:23:28.954]  But back then it was an open conspiracy.
[01:23:28.954 --> 01:23:32.896]  It was Americans are more literate than anyone else in the world on average.
[01:23:32.896 --> 01:23:35.298]  They're all reading and they're addicted to it.
[01:23:35.298 --> 01:23:39.020]  And the culture is about being rugged and individual and very aggressive and indomitable.
[01:23:40.362 --> 01:23:49.157]  And they've got statements like, the Greek Iliads may have been fantasy, but we've actually raised what looks like, you know, the 300.
[01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:49.898]  It's stuff like that.
[01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:53.552]  And it's just like everywhere they won't put up with our crap.
[01:23:53.552 --> 01:23:56.395]  No one will lay that down to us.
[01:23:56.395 --> 01:23:58.257]  Now the blacks are picking it up.
[01:23:58.257 --> 01:24:03.882]  I mean, it's got these racist statements like that, that the blacks were being empowered and becoming free with Christian groups.
[01:24:03.882 --> 01:24:07.825]  And they're just like, we got to get a handle on this right now.
[01:24:07.825 --> 01:24:13.830]  And globalism and everything you've seen is an attempt to seduce, overtake, use America's power.
[01:24:14.941 --> 01:24:22.273]  Small geographically, 4% of the world's population, we had half the wealth, 54% in 1958.
[01:24:22.273 --> 01:24:28.884]  So you know why I'm frustrated all the time?
[01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:47.702]  It's outrageously ridiculous how obvious this is and that Trump is Americana and is very, very pragmatic and is just like, why take the most powerful, beautiful, awesome, cool thing and crap all over it because you're intimidated by it?
[01:24:47.702 --> 01:24:52.325]  Why not ride the thing to victory?
[01:24:52.325 --> 01:24:57.769]  And why does Hollywood have this, I don't want to be profane here on air, but it's the only term that works.
[01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:05.113]  Why do they have the needle, you know what, syndrome?
[01:25:05.113 --> 01:25:07.814]  Where they've just got to run everything in the ground.
[01:25:07.814 --> 01:25:10.475]  Man, these are bad people!
[01:25:10.475 --> 01:25:15.398]  And the left and the globalists are in a concerted effort with, who do I always tell you?
[01:25:15.398 --> 01:25:22.002]  The chi-coms, the UN, the top megabanks, the propagandist Hollywood scum, the unelected EU.
[01:25:22.002 --> 01:25:26.184]  And that's the combine with huge third world populations they've enslaved and exploited.
[01:25:27.469 --> 01:25:49.247]  That they are then rampaging into Europe and rampaging into America because they want to fully capture our republics and not have real voting anymore by the outsider checkmate to literally exploit the West and turn us into giant warmock juggernaut hellships.
[01:25:49.247 --> 01:25:51.749]  You think Hitler was bad?
[01:25:51.749 --> 01:25:55.752]  If the United States goes pure evil like they've been trying to do, we are screwed.
[01:25:57.537 --> 01:26:01.680]  We have a responsibility to not let these people take over.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:08.284]  Just like Lindsey Graham finally, after McCain was gone, could be himself, and he said, my God, this is crap.
[01:26:08.284 --> 01:26:14.388]  And I tell you right now, you sure want power, and I hope you don't ever get it, because you're evil!
[01:26:14.388 --> 01:26:17.890]  And suddenly everybody goes from hating him to loving him, because he's being real!
[01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.172]  And he's saying, you people want a power?
[01:26:20.172 --> 01:26:21.292]  You hate America?
[01:26:21.292 --> 01:26:23.714]  You're a bunch of damn liars!
[01:26:23.714 --> 01:26:25.135]  Because it's what they are!
[01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:32.052]  I don't dislike these poor folks, but let me tell you something.
[01:26:32.052 --> 01:26:36.575]  In almost all of Latin America now, they make the women go to factories and they give these kids U.N.
[01:26:36.575 --> 01:26:40.917]  run formula where their brains are like a third smaller.
[01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:50.561]  There's big scandals all over the world where they have microloans and encourage women to go to work, but they have to sign off and take all these vaccines and drink this milk that doesn't even have enough protein or fat.
[01:26:50.561 --> 01:26:54.743]  And you've got giant, you know the IQ of Latin America is going straight down.
[01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:55.884]  Our IQ is going straight down.
[01:26:57.355 --> 01:27:03.817]  So, you've got a bunch of, like, people that didn't get the milk they needed for their brains.
[01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:16.541]  They're the worst of the worst in those countries, organized by the UN to slam in with Reuters and AP and Forbes and Soros saying, we're going to bring America and Europe down with these invasion forces.
[01:27:16.541 --> 01:27:19.362]  And then it happens, and I'm showing you Reuters last segment.
[01:27:19.362 --> 01:27:20.523]  I'm showing you!
[01:27:20.523 --> 01:27:23.384]  And Lou Dobbs isn't even allowed to say it!
[01:27:24.352 --> 01:27:33.500]  He's allowed to say it's great if he's George Soros, but Lou Dobbs can't go, oh look, Soros says he's funding it!
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.862]  Because George Soros dropped.
[01:27:36.693 --> 01:27:53.823]  In January of this year, $32 billion he bought into PayPal, he bought into Facebook, he bought into Twitter, he bought into all the major groups, he funded all the Democrats with double, triple the money they've ever had, and that's just the beginning.
[01:27:53.823 --> 01:27:58.246]  They allowed this foreign, Nazi-collaborating globalist to dump $32 billion on the thing
[01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:05.693]  The Republicans haven't dumped one billion in this election cycle, and they're doing everything they can to fight this.
[01:28:05.693 --> 01:28:07.454]  They're the rich elite.
[01:28:07.454 --> 01:28:08.634]  These Democrats.
[01:28:08.634 --> 01:28:11.595]  Global.
[01:28:11.595 --> 01:28:15.956]  He's doing it with your taxpayer money he's swindled over the years.
[01:28:15.956 --> 01:28:20.058]  He's matching funds from the UN that they get from the US, and we're fighting 32 to 1.
[01:28:23.925 --> 01:28:24.406]  And guess what?
[01:28:24.406 --> 01:28:26.708]  We're still kicking their butt.
[01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:28.449]  So that's why I'm so wound up, folks.
[01:28:28.449 --> 01:28:32.193]  This is our country really under 21st century warfare attack.
[01:28:32.193 --> 01:28:34.195]  And let me tell you who's listening.
[01:28:34.195 --> 01:28:36.838]  The president knows it's true.
[01:28:36.838 --> 01:28:46.027]  Because... I mean, I've done more studying than those generals he's got in that room with him on all these actual programs.
[01:28:47.051 --> 01:28:48.715]  Most of these guys play golf all day.
[01:28:48.715 --> 01:28:50.901]  I'm telling you what's going on here.
[01:28:50.901 --> 01:28:53.006]  And so the military, everybody's tuned in.
[01:28:53.006 --> 01:28:54.429]  So let the left not know what's going on.
[01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:54.670]  We know.
[01:28:57.398 --> 01:29:04.164]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:08.447]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[01:29:08.447 --> 01:29:13.051]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[01:29:27.242 --> 01:29:31.125]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:36.109]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:40.933]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[01:29:47.418 --> 01:29:47.979]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.979 --> 01:29:50.281]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:05.619]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:30:05.619 --> 01:30:08.760]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.421]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:30:11.421 --> 01:30:15.722]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:30:15.722 --> 01:30:23.203]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:30:23.203 --> 01:30:25.624]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:30:29.073 --> 01:30:31.294]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:30:31.294 --> 01:30:32.155]  They called it U.N.
[01:30:32.155 --> 01:30:33.496]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:30:33.496 --> 01:30:34.316]  2030 Agenda.
[01:30:34.316 --> 01:30:46.243]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:30:46.243 --> 01:30:48.625]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:51.306]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:30:51.306 --> 01:30:52.787]  I mean, what?
[01:30:52.787 --> 01:30:53.427]  I mean, never!
[01:30:58.297 --> 01:31:01.000]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.345]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:31:07.345 --> 01:31:09.107]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[01:31:09.107 --> 01:31:15.693]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[01:31:15.913 --> 01:31:16.173]  I think so.
[01:31:33.626 --> 01:31:34.086]  I think so.
[01:31:58.141 --> 01:32:06.551]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:08.013]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:08.013 --> 01:32:12.718]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.718 --> 01:32:17.724]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.944 --> 01:32:38.093]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:32:38.593 --> 01:32:42.275]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:33:01.284 --> 01:33:03.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.967 --> 01:33:23.569]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[01:33:23.569 --> 01:33:28.753]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.753 --> 01:33:31.134]  We're really doing it.
[01:33:31.134 --> 01:33:34.396]  We saw the globalists building their plan to abolish the country.
[01:33:34.396 --> 01:33:37.618]  For decades, the CFR is sucking us dry.
[01:33:37.618 --> 01:33:40.300]  We began to warn people, we built defenses.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.781]  Things came true.
[01:33:41.781 --> 01:33:43.442]  Our credibility went way up.
[01:33:43.442 --> 01:33:44.523]  They censored us.
[01:33:44.523 --> 01:33:47.285]  Credibility went up even more, because we told you it was coming.
[01:33:47.285 --> 01:33:48.986]  Now the UN invasion force is here.
[01:33:50.845 --> 01:33:54.247]  And so, it's just incredible.
[01:33:54.247 --> 01:33:56.008]  We didn't just sit there on the bench.
[01:33:56.008 --> 01:33:57.869]  You didn't sit there on the bench.
[01:33:57.869 --> 01:34:00.950]  You got made fun of by your neighbors, by your family.
[01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:04.792]  Every cartoon movie made fun of New World Order, global government people.
[01:34:04.792 --> 01:34:06.753]  Now, yeah, world government's here.
[01:34:06.753 --> 01:34:08.974]  There's gonna be a world cashless society.
[01:34:08.974 --> 01:34:09.975]  You don't do what we say.
[01:34:09.975 --> 01:34:11.996]  You don't buy and sell.
[01:34:11.996 --> 01:34:13.757]  Our credibility just went up even more.
[01:34:13.757 --> 01:34:16.238]  And so did the Bibles.
[01:34:17.965 --> 01:34:19.025]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:19.025 --> 01:34:23.506]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're a believer in reality.
[01:34:23.506 --> 01:34:28.588]  But let me put out the big quantum statement.
[01:34:28.588 --> 01:34:45.512]  If you don't choose America, if you don't choose Trump, if you don't choose sovereignty, if you don't choose what works in capitalism, and the sovereignty of the nation we paid for and built, and if you believe we're the worst thing in the world, then you're an idiot.
[01:34:48.567 --> 01:34:56.835]  I mean, the Chinese Communists don't have nursing homes for 99% of the public.
[01:34:56.835 --> 01:34:57.776]  There isn't daycare.
[01:34:57.776 --> 01:35:01.700]  The children are chained to power poles, and there's piles of crap everywhere.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.504]  You go work 15 hours, then you go sleep in a container, and maybe you get one meal a day.
[01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:07.840]  They want us to compete with that.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.760]  You don't compete with it by going to its level.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.882]  You demand they have projects for their own people and build them up.
[01:35:13.882 --> 01:35:14.883]  They're not doing that.
[01:35:14.883 --> 01:35:21.006]  They're only building up the weapons systems and the industrial power of the CHICOMS to leverage out the U.S.
[01:35:21.006 --> 01:35:27.248]  and Europe because traitors in our own government went over there and set it up!
[01:35:27.248 --> 01:35:28.529]  And I... Yeah, back out.
[01:35:28.529 --> 01:35:30.610]  That's a photo of kids chained up at the power poles.
[01:35:31.633 --> 01:35:32.574]  We're at the light pulse.
[01:35:32.574 --> 01:35:36.236]  So that's what goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:36.236 --> 01:35:45.222]  And the globalists are totally cold-blooded and they know that you have a conscience.
[01:35:45.222 --> 01:35:52.267]  And so you see what the mainstream media always little cropped photos from a bigger photo of a woman holding her kid up
[01:35:53.137 --> 01:35:55.498]  And there's a riot cop in front of her with a club.
[01:35:55.498 --> 01:36:00.219]  They don't pull the picture back, and you see guys throwing rocks at him ten feet behind her.
[01:36:00.219 --> 01:36:05.840]  It just looks like he's about to hit a woman in the head, meanwhile he's just got his shield, because five rocks are coming at him!
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.800]  But she's up there with the kid!
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.721]  She ought to have her ass thrown in prison!
[01:36:11.721 --> 01:36:20.643]  But you see, all the photos that the media has seen all over in the last few months, in the last few weeks, two-year-old baby held up,
[01:36:21.581 --> 01:36:23.162]  There's the riot cop.
[01:36:23.162 --> 01:36:24.583]  You notice he's not like this at her.
[01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:25.484]  He's not about to hit her.
[01:36:25.484 --> 01:36:27.726]  He's just like this with a shield.
[01:36:27.726 --> 01:36:30.007]  And then you see another photo of it.
[01:36:30.007 --> 01:36:31.288]  Oh my God.
[01:36:31.288 --> 01:36:34.931]  And there is the group of people throwing firebombs.
[01:36:34.931 --> 01:36:41.496]  And rocks and helicopters and just all of the insanity.
[01:36:41.496 --> 01:36:45.339]  And every last area that hasn't collapsed, it's got to be taken over.
[01:36:45.339 --> 01:36:46.680]  It's got to be taken over.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.861]  It's got to be run down.
[01:36:47.861 --> 01:36:48.842]  It's got to be controlled.
[01:36:51.587 --> 01:36:57.172]  The Democrats are there to organize them, the Socialists are there to control them.
[01:36:57.172 --> 01:37:02.016]  Paul Joseph Watson, viral video, shows migrant caravan members throwing rocks at helicopter.
[01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:02.556]  Get it!
[01:37:02.556 --> 01:37:04.458]  Infowars.com, get it out!
[01:37:04.458 --> 01:37:16.888]  Project Veritas has released unbelievable video out of the main headquarters down in South Texas, where Beto's supposedly from, Pito's from, I'm sorry, Beto's the name of Pito.
[01:37:21.212 --> 01:37:25.478]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:25.478 --> 01:37:27.021]  And he's there with the UN.
[01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:29.304]  50% of his funds come from Soros.
[01:37:29.304 --> 01:37:30.165]  That's Associated Press.
[01:37:31.528 --> 01:37:38.953]  And Mastercard and the UN funding all the illegals coming up to El Paso and McAllen where they're already there.
[01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.434]  They say, we've got a new caravan today.
[01:37:40.434 --> 01:37:42.975]  Everybody's like, well, the caravan hasn't gotten there yet.
[01:37:42.975 --> 01:37:44.556]  There's caravans every day.
[01:37:44.556 --> 01:37:46.838]  We've been down there for years.
[01:37:46.838 --> 01:37:53.642]  I begged listeners five years ago when we first got footage to make it a big deal and Drudge linked to it and still no one covered it.
[01:37:55.549 --> 01:37:59.312]  Hundreds of buses a day, loaded with people.
[01:37:59.312 --> 01:38:05.217]  But on local news, it's like, the United Nations is here, running the refugee program, helping with the children.
[01:38:05.217 --> 01:38:07.739]  A bunch of military-age men behind them.
[01:38:07.739 --> 01:38:11.342]  And I'm like, the UN, the UN, here's the document, the UN runs it.
[01:38:11.342 --> 01:38:13.384]  Shut up, Jones, the UN runs it.
[01:38:13.384 --> 01:38:15.586]  Oh yeah, right, sure.
[01:38:15.586 --> 01:38:22.632]  Hey look, they're killing cops all over the US, saying they've got to go under Strong Cities Initiative, where the UN is the new police board and runs them.
[01:38:27.332 --> 01:38:32.015]  And people go, oh, you're insane when it's Loretta Lynch officially doing it.
[01:38:32.015 --> 01:38:36.278]  So that's what I'm getting at here is folks, listen.
[01:38:36.278 --> 01:38:37.759]  We're under invasion.
[01:38:37.759 --> 01:38:44.504]  It's a consortium of corporations and dictatorships working in tandem to conquer what's left of the free world.
[01:38:44.504 --> 01:38:46.945]  And it doesn't mean America and Europe's perfect.
[01:38:46.945 --> 01:38:48.466]  But let me tell you something.
[01:38:48.466 --> 01:38:49.127]  We go down.
[01:38:50.151 --> 01:38:59.780]  Katie, bar the door, because these globalists have got some really bad plans for you and your family, and they lie to you, show arrogantly, and they tell you these things.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.461]  It's insane.
[01:39:00.461 --> 01:39:04.545]  Now, I'm going to give the number up.
[01:39:04.545 --> 01:39:09.129]  When we come back, I'm going to air this piece that I asked one of our great editors, McBrain, to put together this morning.
[01:39:09.129 --> 01:39:09.770]  He did it very quickly.
[01:39:10.947 --> 01:39:17.473]  Where Jon Stewart has come out from hiding, crawled out from under the rock he's hiding under, with a nice guy act.
[01:39:17.473 --> 01:39:18.734]  He's the good cop.
[01:39:18.734 --> 01:39:21.456]  You know, his brother's one of the top globalists.
[01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:23.237]  And, oh yeah.
[01:39:23.237 --> 01:39:26.060]  And, oh, he's there with Dave Chappelle, so it's alright.
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.482]  Dave Chappelle wants to bring everybody together, white and black.
[01:39:28.482 --> 01:39:33.947]  Man, I went to one of his shows, the most anti-white, racist crap I ever heard.
[01:39:33.947 --> 01:39:35.568]  I left with my wife halfway into it.
[01:39:37.708 --> 01:39:43.729]  So let me tell you, he's got what he says in public, and when he says something in an arena, I was like, my God, I'm getting out of here.
[01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:52.651]  But the point is, is that they're up there, the cool guys, and we come back, and man, they say Trump's crazy.
[01:39:52.651 --> 01:39:59.132]  It's like he says it's Mad Max and Thunderdome when it's great in the Middle East, and it's great in North Africa, it's great in Latin America.
[01:39:59.132 --> 01:40:01.152]  We need to bring all these people in.
[01:40:01.152 --> 01:40:02.452]  What the hell is he talking about?
[01:40:02.452 --> 01:40:06.353]  So we're gonna juxtapose what he said with the video and the audio coming up.
[01:40:08.354 --> 01:40:09.616]  I'm going to give the number out right now.
[01:40:09.616 --> 01:40:14.904]  I'm going to take your calls throughout the entire third hour ahead of Joel Gilbert coming up.
[01:40:17.082 --> 01:40:17.502]  This number.
[01:40:39.946 --> 01:40:45.008]  I want to go to Border Patrol or Regular Army or I don't want to think Classified or Secret.
[01:40:45.008 --> 01:40:46.068]  Believe me, I already know all of it.
[01:40:46.068 --> 01:40:46.728]  I'm not bragging.
[01:40:46.728 --> 01:40:47.849]  I just do.
[01:40:47.849 --> 01:40:51.390]  But about what you think about the border deployment, is it enough?
[01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.730]  Only a few hundred have showed up so far.
[01:40:53.730 --> 01:40:55.791]  Fifteen thousand are supposed to be there in the next month.
[01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:56.451]  That's not enough.
[01:40:56.451 --> 01:40:57.432]  They're busting them up.
[01:40:57.432 --> 01:40:59.392]  They're going to hit in the next two or three days.
[01:40:59.392 --> 01:41:01.073]  They're already hitting right now, as I told you.
[01:41:01.833 --> 01:41:09.857]  But the big, aggressive, militarized ones with firebombs and fallout cocktails and guns, including AK-47s, these are a U.N.
[01:41:09.857 --> 01:41:15.000]  jihadi invasion force with hardcore commies holding up their kids right in front of them.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.441]  So, what's your take on that?
[01:41:16.441 --> 01:41:19.222]  You'll go to the head of the line, at least for the first few calls.
[01:41:19.222 --> 01:41:19.543]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[01:41:19.543 --> 01:41:20.963]  And then, people are like, why are you so fired up?
[01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:31.771]  The globalists are trying to literally destroy me.
[01:41:31.771 --> 01:41:32.891]  I'm just a loyal American.
[01:41:32.891 --> 01:41:34.271]  It's all happening.
[01:41:34.271 --> 01:41:37.652]  The Democrats are literally globalist invasion force leaders.
[01:41:37.652 --> 01:41:39.293]  I mean, I'm a loyal American.
[01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.753]  Pet your side, people!
[01:41:40.753 --> 01:41:43.254]  This isn't rhetoric!
[01:41:43.254 --> 01:41:47.335]  They want me off the air, and you off the air, and thousands of others ahead of this!
[01:41:47.335 --> 01:41:48.755]  They're planning bombs!
[01:41:48.755 --> 01:41:50.416]  They're planning false flags!
[01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:51.916]  They're planning mass shootings!
[01:41:51.916 --> 01:41:53.497]  They're planning race riots!
[01:41:53.497 --> 01:41:55.977]  Every Hollywood show, every movie is race war!
[01:41:55.977 --> 01:41:58.098]  This is total globalist BS!
[01:42:01.334 --> 01:42:03.518]  And we need your financial support.
[01:42:03.518 --> 01:42:05.581]  Plus, you need the products at importwarstore.com.
[01:42:05.581 --> 01:42:12.572]  If you don't wear your colors proud, we've got shirts that'll only help you meet patriots that say things like Molon Labe or things like that.
[01:42:12.572 --> 01:42:13.954]  Or, you want to really get in the fight,
[01:42:15.486 --> 01:42:17.147]  They'll try to kill you in blue areas.
[01:42:17.147 --> 01:42:17.687]  I'm serious.
[01:42:17.687 --> 01:42:19.228]  It's amazing to see how criminal they are.
[01:42:19.228 --> 01:42:22.749]  Or a Trump Peds 2020 shirt, or an Alex Jones shirt, or an InfoWars shirt.
[01:42:22.749 --> 01:42:35.674]  We've got incredible designs of George Washington, French and Indian War, and just all sorts of other really cool, the InfoWars Tiananmen Square Tank Man shirt, and Re-Elect 45 shirt, and Forbidden Information shirts.
[01:42:35.674 --> 01:42:38.515]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.062]  X3.
[01:42:42.062 --> 01:42:46.126]  They tried to suppress us, but that which did not stop us only made us stronger.
[01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:57.338]  We now have X3 even better deep-earth crystals with two other forms of iodine for activation, a tiny amount of vitamin C to make it come into the magic formula of X3.
[01:42:57.338 --> 01:43:01.222]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:43:02.566 --> 01:43:11.249]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:43:11.249 --> 01:43:13.230]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:16.691]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:19.312]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:43:19.312 --> 01:43:21.593]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:43:21.593 --> 01:43:28.536]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:43:29.096 --> 01:43:33.968]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com
[01:43:35.174 --> 01:43:38.876]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:43:38.876 --> 01:43:40.057]  We'll win.
[01:43:40.057 --> 01:43:42.378]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:43:42.378 --> 01:43:48.282]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[01:43:48.282 --> 01:43:50.123]  And you're right, to the market.
[01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:53.825]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[01:43:53.825 --> 01:43:55.366]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:43:55.366 --> 01:43:56.266]  We need your support.
[01:43:56.266 --> 01:43:56.987]  I'm counting on you.
[01:43:56.987 --> 01:44:04.131]  The Globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:06.251]  That it lowers IQ.
[01:44:06.251 --> 01:44:09.132]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.132 --> 01:44:15.854]  And on our quest to bring, our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:15.854 --> 01:44:22.095]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.095 --> 01:44:27.697]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:28.397 --> 01:44:35.419]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:35.419 --> 01:44:49.504]  But, chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.504 --> 01:44:53.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:53.745 --> 01:44:56.446]  X3, now available at mfullerslife.com.

[01:47:00.864 --> 01:47:09.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.888 --> 01:47:14.710]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[01:47:14.710 --> 01:47:16.391]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:16.391 --> 01:47:18.052]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:22.794]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.815 --> 01:47:41.486]  So, it's in the WikiLeaks, two years ago plus, where you've got top psychological warfare professors sending Hillary emails saying, we gotta go race war, we gotta go culture war, every level, everybody's fighting, kneeling near the national anthem, whites are bad, America's bad, just to cause total division.
[01:47:42.739 --> 01:47:47.962]  Because people want prosperity and we can't deal with Trump's message to just make it race war.
[01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:51.503]  Well, photo NFL cheerleader takes a knee during National Anthem.
[01:47:51.503 --> 01:47:55.045]  She'll get lots of attention from the media and she's saying America's bad.
[01:47:55.045 --> 01:47:56.586]  She's saying she's bad.
[01:47:56.586 --> 01:47:59.067]  Because quote minorities are the majority now in most areas.
[01:47:59.067 --> 01:48:00.908]  It's your country.
[01:48:00.908 --> 01:48:04.630]  But they don't want you to identify with private property and right to self-defense and all this.
[01:48:04.630 --> 01:48:08.532]  No, they want you to identify with socialism and communism.
[01:48:08.532 --> 01:48:11.213]  What Michael Moore says the demographics of white people dying
[01:48:13.274 --> 01:48:22.019]  He means, oh, we think we can brainwash minorities because they're stupid, he thinks, into supporting not wanting what made America great.
[01:48:22.019 --> 01:48:22.599]  Bill Kristol.
[01:48:22.599 --> 01:48:27.102]  Lazy white working class Americans should be replaced by immigrants.
[01:48:27.102 --> 01:48:28.603]  Remember that?
[01:48:28.603 --> 01:48:30.444]  New York Times op-ed this week.
[01:48:30.444 --> 01:48:33.886]  Brags of replacing embittered white conservative minority.
[01:48:33.886 --> 01:48:38.508]  Literal white genocide.
[01:48:38.508 --> 01:48:39.529]  Opinion.
[01:48:39.529 --> 01:48:41.010]  We can replace them.
[01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:41.450]  White people.
[01:48:43.336 --> 01:48:46.497]  And you go, oh my God, they say get rid of whites, it's white genocide.
[01:48:46.497 --> 01:48:49.859]  Michelle Goldberg, I should say, is almost white.
[01:48:49.859 --> 01:48:53.140]  And then it's like, oh, they're crazy, they say we want to replace them.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:57.462]  Michael Moore tells angry white American guys to give it up.
[01:48:57.462 --> 01:48:58.542]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:48:58.542 --> 01:48:59.183]  Well, I agree.
[01:48:59.183 --> 01:49:04.025]  Doesn't seem to be a bunch of weird, evil white people doing all this.
[01:49:04.025 --> 01:49:05.986]  How can I cure my white guilt?
[01:49:05.986 --> 01:49:06.566]  New York Times.
[01:49:07.947 --> 01:49:09.528]  Do whatever we say, that's how you do it.
[01:49:09.528 --> 01:49:13.369]  See, now it's like, ooh, you're bad, everyone's, you're white.
[01:49:13.369 --> 01:49:17.990]  They're all like KKK now because they got taught it's okay to be racist if it's a white, see?
[01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:22.972]  We're gonna, don't be scared, do whatever we say, but it's not minorities that are even doing it.
[01:49:22.972 --> 01:49:27.573]  It's weird white controllers getting some minorities to get into this weird cult.
[01:49:27.573 --> 01:49:29.014]  This is sick.
[01:49:29.014 --> 01:49:30.694]  God, this is so cold-blooded.
[01:49:30.694 --> 01:49:32.615]  Can my children be friends with white people?
[01:49:32.615 --> 01:49:33.555]  New York Times.
[01:49:33.555 --> 01:49:34.956]  Probably not, she says.
[01:49:34.956 --> 01:49:35.596]  They're bad.
[01:49:37.338 --> 01:49:38.859]  Inherently a group.
[01:49:38.859 --> 01:49:40.660]  White women, come get your people.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:41.660]  That's right.
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:46.703]  Oh, the establishment gets women scared and says, come with us and we won't kill you.
[01:49:46.703 --> 01:49:49.184]  Like Humongous says in Road Warrior.
[01:49:49.184 --> 01:49:51.945]  Just give us the gas, spill your lives.
[01:49:51.945 --> 01:49:53.106]  It's a reasonable proposition.
[01:49:53.106 --> 01:49:57.148]  And then you know what happens when they try to... Humongous kills them.
[01:49:57.148 --> 01:50:00.670]  Bring in the radical Muslims, it's so good in their countries.
[01:50:00.670 --> 01:50:03.631]  Thanks, Islam.
[01:50:03.631 --> 01:50:06.653]  Why white supremacists are chugging milk and white geneticists are alarmed?
[01:50:06.653 --> 01:50:06.953]  I'm not...
[01:50:07.918 --> 01:50:08.358]  Joking.
[01:50:08.358 --> 01:50:09.099]  Milk is racist.
[01:50:09.099 --> 01:50:10.300]  New York Times.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.481]  They make everything racist.
[01:50:11.481 --> 01:50:12.462]  Don Lemon.
[01:50:12.462 --> 01:50:13.983]  Whites are the biggest terrorists.
[01:50:13.983 --> 01:50:16.265]  They're the inherent evil.
[01:50:16.265 --> 01:50:21.329]  He word for word says, you don't want to talk about people as a group, but whites are evil.
[01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:23.971]  That's all just lately.
[01:50:23.971 --> 01:50:30.236]  And now in Fort Worth, Texas, someone put up, it's okay to be white flyers.
[01:50:30.236 --> 01:50:32.658]  We put them out saying it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black.
[01:50:32.658 --> 01:50:34.539]  Nobody bit on that.
[01:50:34.539 --> 01:50:36.341]  It's great to be human, was the full poster.
[01:50:37.498 --> 01:50:40.519]  And oh, everyone agrees, this is bad.
[01:50:40.519 --> 01:50:41.820]  Oh no, white is bad.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:49.683]  And they just go find the people, the followers, the slaves, the idiots, to like virtue signal.
[01:50:49.683 --> 01:50:51.143]  I think it's very frightening.
[01:50:51.143 --> 01:50:53.824]  There's just all over the news saying whites are inherently bad.
[01:50:53.824 --> 01:50:55.865]  And then look, he's a good leftist.
[01:50:55.865 --> 01:50:57.165]  He tears it down.
[01:50:57.165 --> 01:51:01.247]  What did they show in the New York Times yesterday about Soros?
[01:51:01.247 --> 01:51:03.468]  Yeah, he gave 32 billion this year to crush Trump.
[01:51:05.612 --> 01:51:14.340]  And it shows, in Hungary, Soros activists pulling down with metal scrapers.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.242]  With metal scrapers.
[01:51:17.242 --> 01:51:22.747]  The Soros sign put up during the campaign saying Soros has spent billions trying to overthrow our country.
[01:51:22.747 --> 01:51:24.248]  Let's not let this guy do this to us.
[01:51:24.248 --> 01:51:26.770]  Let's vote for our sovereignty and control our borders.
[01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:31.394]  But the good Soros people, thank God, they came out and they all tore down that billboard.
[01:51:31.394 --> 01:51:31.795]  Yay!
[01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:45.338]  And this person walks over, it's not okay to be white, I'm an old weird white lady, I'm gonna virtue signal, and I'm gonna walk over and I'm gonna tear that down.
[01:51:45.338 --> 01:51:52.944]  We pull up yesterday's New York Times, it was something like, uh, Soros, once the target of the fringe, now mainstream right-wing attacking.
[01:51:52.944 --> 01:51:59.289]  He didn't do anything, he just gave 32 billion this year, all other Republican spending outnumbered 30 to 1, 32 to 1.
[01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:03.812]  My God, he's just 32 billion.
[01:52:03.812 --> 01:52:06.673]  He just funds half of O'Rourke and a UN invasion force.
[01:52:06.673 --> 01:52:08.074]  My goodness, why are they upset?
[01:52:08.074 --> 01:52:13.398]  Yeah, the New York Times did a whole video attacking me and Glenn Beck about it.
[01:52:13.398 --> 01:52:14.979]  If you show the New York Times articles what I'm saying.
[01:52:17.394 --> 01:52:21.577]  It's titled, you know, once fringe to attack Soros, now it's mainline Republican.
[01:52:21.577 --> 01:52:26.821]  And then it says, yeah, he basically runs everything, but we're tearing down signs against him.
[01:52:26.821 --> 01:52:27.861]  So don't worry.
[01:52:27.861 --> 01:52:28.162]  There it is.
[01:52:28.162 --> 01:52:30.864]  How vilification of George Soros moved from the fringes to mainstream.
[01:52:30.864 --> 01:52:32.745]  Now scroll down.
[01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:34.986]  I guess you've got the video up there.
[01:52:34.986 --> 01:52:41.371]  There's an article and the article is him pulling down signs saying he's against free speech.
[01:52:41.371 --> 01:52:45.374]  I mean, you talk about solid gold.
[01:52:47.247 --> 01:52:50.148]  But again, that's what the left's all about, is contradicting.
[01:52:50.148 --> 01:52:52.229]  How dare him say Soros is behind it.
[01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:53.790]  I have Soros in Reuters.
[01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:55.951]  Document Cam, shot, please.
[01:52:55.951 --> 01:53:05.415]  Funding the Middle Eastern, the African, and the Latin American invasions with MasterCard paying them thousands of dollars per leg to do it.
[01:53:05.415 --> 01:53:07.576]  That's Reuters two years ago!
[01:53:07.576 --> 01:53:09.377]  Reuters!
[01:53:09.377 --> 01:53:10.317]  Reuters!
[01:53:10.317 --> 01:53:11.858]  But don't worry, people
[01:53:12.864 --> 01:53:15.265]  They've rejected it, so now they're denying he's behind it.
[01:53:15.265 --> 01:53:16.425]  He's not behind it.
[01:53:16.425 --> 01:53:18.166]  It's not illegal to fund human smuggling.
[01:53:18.166 --> 01:53:19.407]  There's nothing going on.
[01:53:19.407 --> 01:53:21.507]  He didn't do anything.
[01:53:21.507 --> 01:53:24.909]  But then we've got Jon Stewart.
[01:53:24.909 --> 01:53:28.710]  Jon Stewart, that little sweetsie.
[01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:30.011]  He's just up there being nice.
[01:53:30.011 --> 01:53:32.732]  He's like, Trump says the borders are collapsing.
[01:53:32.732 --> 01:53:35.093]  It's like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.
[01:53:35.093 --> 01:53:36.333]  That's ridiculous.
[01:53:36.333 --> 01:53:38.154]  It's far worse, Mr. Stewart.
[01:53:38.154 --> 01:53:38.494]  Here it is.
[01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:41.571]  Not much in the midterms.
[01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:45.432]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:53:45.432 --> 01:53:53.095]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:53:53.095 --> 01:53:56.296]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:54:07.353 --> 01:54:12.477]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:54:12.477 --> 01:54:14.839]  Guys, do me a favor.
[01:54:14.839 --> 01:54:17.581]  Bring me yesterday's stack, please.
[01:54:17.581 --> 01:54:20.464]  Because I want to go through it, because I'm going to show people like I did yesterday.
[01:54:20.464 --> 01:54:24.647]  Because I'm going to do it.
[01:54:24.647 --> 01:54:26.609]  Soros' people pulling down billboards.
[01:54:26.609 --> 01:54:29.050]  Yes, you found the version of the video in the New York Times.
[01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:32.733]  There's an article of the same headline that is an article.
[01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:34.495]  And it's got them pulling down the billboards.
[01:54:35.845 --> 01:54:36.926]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:54:36.926 --> 01:54:43.729]  I know there's a video.
[01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:46.870]  You're hearing Jeopardy music now in the background, folks, because I sure am.
[01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:48.031]  There it is.
[01:54:48.031 --> 01:54:50.612]  Oh, that's the video.
[01:54:50.612 --> 01:54:53.933]  Okay, let's do this.
[01:54:53.933 --> 01:54:54.854]  We had the video yesterday.
[01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:57.515]  I want to play the video, then.
[01:54:57.515 --> 01:54:59.516]  We're going to play the video, then I'm going to come out there.
[01:54:59.516 --> 01:55:02.137]  No big deal.
[01:55:02.137 --> 01:55:05.639]  And I'm going to get it out of my yesterday's stack.
[01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:16.753]  Because yesterday, Stack has them with the photo of activists in Hungary pulling down the billboards.
[01:55:16.753 --> 01:55:19.675]  Because I have to show everyone what I say.
[01:55:19.675 --> 01:55:21.076]  Because they say it doesn't exist.
[01:55:21.076 --> 01:55:21.856]  I will show you.
[01:55:21.856 --> 01:55:27.460]  But again, George Soros, MasterCard, to partner to aid migrants and refugees.
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:32.283]  Reuters, reporting on it all, officially Reuters, officially MasterCard is announcing
[01:55:36.897 --> 01:55:43.559]  And I have MasterCard officially announcing that they are paying for it all with George Soros from MasterCard.com.
[01:55:43.559 --> 01:55:44.660]  But they say it doesn't exist.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.340]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.781]  That's MasterCard.com.
[01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:50.642]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:50.642 --> 01:55:52.082]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:52.082 --> 01:55:53.663]  With George Soros funding it.
[01:55:53.663 --> 01:55:55.104]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:55.104 --> 01:55:56.424]  MasterCard.com.
[01:55:56.424 --> 01:56:00.125]  Telling you, their enemy, that it isn't happening.
[01:56:00.125 --> 01:56:01.206]  Let's go to the New York Times piece.
[01:56:01.206 --> 01:56:01.506]  Here it is.
[01:56:02.435 --> 01:56:03.536]  George Soros.
[01:56:03.536 --> 01:56:07.379]  The caravan I feel that all these people are being paid off.
[01:56:07.379 --> 01:56:10.421]  I believe it's paid for by George Soros.
[01:56:10.421 --> 01:56:16.426]  George Soros, the billionaire Democratic fundraiser who has long been villainized in certain right-wing circles.
[01:56:16.426 --> 01:56:19.408]  Billionaire George Soros bankrolls the resistance.
[01:56:19.408 --> 01:56:24.812]  He's been the target of anti-Semitic smears and is often at the center of conspiracy theories.
[01:56:24.812 --> 01:56:26.293]  Who's behind the puppets?
[01:56:26.293 --> 01:56:27.254]  Who's the puppet master?
[01:56:28.399 --> 01:56:29.700]  George Soros.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:36.986]  Accused of everything from secretly influencing left-wing policy to funding a caravan of migrants going north toward the United States.
[01:56:36.986 --> 01:56:38.968]  Well, who do you think is behind these caravans?
[01:56:38.968 --> 01:56:41.010]  A lot of speculation that it's George Soros.
[01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:41.830]  George Soros.
[01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:42.511]  George Soros.
[01:56:42.511 --> 01:56:43.672]  The likes of Soros.
[01:56:43.672 --> 01:56:46.714]  These fabulations have been common on the fringes for years.
[01:56:46.714 --> 01:56:49.857]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[01:56:50.017 --> 01:56:54.759]  But now, his name saturates nearly every corner of the GOP ecosystem.
[01:56:54.759 --> 01:56:57.921]  You hear it from voters in small towns in southern Illinois.
[01:56:57.921 --> 01:56:58.461]  Soros.
[01:56:58.461 --> 01:57:01.483]  George Soros, I believe, is paying all these people.
[01:57:01.483 --> 01:57:04.244]  On primetime newscasts on Fox... George Soros.
[01:57:04.244 --> 01:57:05.285]  George Soros.
[01:57:05.285 --> 01:57:06.025]  George Soros.
[01:57:06.325 --> 01:57:08.106]  Even from the President himself.
[01:57:08.106 --> 01:57:09.286]  George Soros!
[01:57:09.286 --> 01:57:16.068]  The longtime investor and philanthropist became the target of misinformation and conspiracies starting in the 1990s.
[01:57:16.068 --> 01:57:23.451]  Extremists in the US and Europe cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world.
[01:57:23.451 --> 01:57:27.693]  A frontman for the House of Rothschild called George Soros.
[01:57:27.693 --> 01:57:28.693]  Bilderberg Group.
[01:57:29.293 --> 01:57:34.775]  But Soros is no longer only invoked in fringe anti-Semitic conspiracies.
[01:57:34.775 --> 01:57:43.117]  In 2004, he became a target for Republicans more broadly, when he donated $27 million in an effort to defeat then-President George W. Bush.
[01:57:43.117 --> 01:57:57.761]  If we re-elect President Bush, we are telling the world that we've... We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.901 --> 01:57:59.962]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:57:59.962 --> 01:58:02.824]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:58:02.824 --> 01:58:04.325]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.325 --> 01:58:11.150]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:12.411]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:22.937]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.937 --> 01:58:39.747]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.747 --> 01:58:42.909]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.029 --> 01:58:52.337]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:58:52.337 --> 01:58:58.062]  Years ago, InfoWarsLive created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:58.062 --> 01:59:05.949]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:05.949 --> 01:59:09.092]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:59:09.292 --> 01:59:17.314]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:17.314 --> 01:59:26.277]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:26.457 --> 01:59:38.325]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro balancing properties.
[01:59:38.325 --> 01:59:43.128]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:43.128 --> 01:59:51.833]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.833 --> 01:59:54.495]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.449 --> 02:00:04.331]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:04.331 --> 02:00:09.396]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.396 --> 02:00:17.364]  All right, the amazing crew was able to find the New York Times article that I talked about.
[02:00:17.364 --> 02:00:26.113]  There's an accompanying video of a similar headline where they show Soros activists in Hungary pulling down the billboards.
[02:00:27.677 --> 02:00:29.558]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:29.558 --> 02:00:30.179]  There they are.
[02:00:30.179 --> 02:00:31.440]  You don't criticize him.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.021]  You don't have speech.
[02:00:33.021 --> 02:00:34.261]  And then I've got the newscast.
[02:00:34.261 --> 02:00:35.382]  I'm going to play it at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:35.382 --> 02:00:42.967]  We're going to start taking your calls now of where they're pulling down signs in Fort Worth that say it's OK to be white.
[02:00:42.967 --> 02:00:45.329]  As the New York Times and others say, it's bad to be white.
[02:00:45.329 --> 02:00:46.910]  So those clips are coming up.
[02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:48.551]  Now, I want to go to a lot of your calls.
[02:00:48.551 --> 02:00:55.596]  Abraham and Jeff and LaVonna and Alex and Robert and Kathy and JD and Joshua and Kevin and Matt and Andrew and others.
[02:00:57.096 --> 02:01:01.399]  In fact, out of the gates, I'm told Abraham disagrees with me.
[02:01:01.399 --> 02:01:02.400]  Oh, what?
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.541]  Soros isn't funding it?
[02:01:04.541 --> 02:01:07.943]  The New York Times said so, but a year ago said he was?
[02:01:07.943 --> 02:01:11.666]  And here's what happens.
[02:01:11.666 --> 02:01:14.608]  They know they're doing all this.
[02:01:14.608 --> 02:01:19.952]  But they play this game in the controlled media where they go, sky is not blue.
[02:01:19.952 --> 02:01:24.475]  So you debate them that the sky is blue instead of going, you're just a bunch of lying scum, get out of my life.
[02:01:26.664 --> 02:01:30.246]  But then you finally say, get out of my life, and they go, we'll take down all other media but us.
[02:01:30.246 --> 02:01:38.632]  And we'll implode your borders and take your pension funds, and then you'll finally worship Alexander Soros.
[02:01:38.632 --> 02:01:42.294]  Oh, then Soros wants to bring in the poor people to help them.
[02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:44.455]  He plunges third world currencies.
[02:01:44.455 --> 02:01:46.277]  He robs pension funds.
[02:01:46.277 --> 02:01:49.198]  He is just a monster.
[02:01:49.198 --> 02:01:53.421]  But he's liberal, so it's okay.
[02:01:53.421 --> 02:01:55.903]  But he represents this whole class of bloodsuckers.
[02:01:57.213 --> 02:02:00.394]  Alright, Abraham Jeff Lovano.
[02:02:00.394 --> 02:02:02.515]  Abraham, I'm told, disagrees.
[02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:03.655]  That's great.
[02:02:03.655 --> 02:02:05.016]  Tell me about the border crisis.
[02:02:05.016 --> 02:02:08.017]  Tell me how I'm a bad person.
[02:02:08.017 --> 02:02:09.597]  Can you hear me?
[02:02:09.597 --> 02:02:10.038]  Yep.
[02:02:10.038 --> 02:02:12.559]  I said I was going to you.
[02:02:12.559 --> 02:02:14.219]  Alright, are you able to hear me, Alex?
[02:02:14.219 --> 02:02:14.779]  Yes, I can.
[02:02:14.779 --> 02:02:16.340]  I can really hear you.
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:17.560]  Oh, yes.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:24.723]  I somehow disagree with all this decrying by the President, you know, pretty much exclamating violence.
[02:02:25.774 --> 02:02:32.497]  Because Mexico has been helping out a lot to deter all the migrants that are running to Mexico.
[02:02:32.497 --> 02:02:47.044]  I mean, Pompeo just went two weeks ago to speak to the Mexican leaders, and that's the reason why the president, or incoming president of Mexico, he's giving asylum and trying to stop as many migrants to come up here.
[02:02:47.956 --> 02:02:50.917]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:02:50.917 --> 02:02:57.459]  He actually bragged when he was president-elect that part of the UN plan that he was going to help crush our borders and flood the US.
[02:02:57.459 --> 02:03:00.480]  But he's only giving lip service now.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:03.241]  I thought the guy down in Brazil was a Trump-type guy.
[02:03:03.241 --> 02:03:06.702]  I thought the new Mexican president was a socialist.
[02:03:18.271 --> 02:03:24.274]  Mexicans have hope for a change in the country, and this guy, he's been on the front lines for a long time.
[02:03:24.274 --> 02:03:33.678]  He's actually there to help the people of Mexico, so... Well, I guess the collapsing border with Guatemala, I think that'll help you much?
[02:03:33.678 --> 02:03:40.380]  No, we just need to upgrade the whole country's awareness of... You know, how about we just move all of Venezuela to Mexico and not the U.S.?
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:43.222]  You think moving Venezuela to you would help?
[02:03:43.222 --> 02:03:46.603]  Well, there's Mexican television that is
[02:03:47.367 --> 02:03:52.628]  It's a crime that's in Mexico, and Mexico has been infiltrated.
[02:03:52.628 --> 02:03:55.149]  Well that's exactly what's going on.
[02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:58.630]  Look, these big multinationals are collapsing all our countries.
[02:03:58.630 --> 02:04:00.590]  They're totally exploitive.
[02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:02.951]  And I hope your president is better than the one I heard.
[02:04:02.951 --> 02:04:06.092]  He had a bunch of socialist policies, but you never know.
[02:04:06.092 --> 02:04:07.192]  I appreciate your call, Abraham.
[02:04:07.192 --> 02:04:07.612]  God bless.
[02:04:07.612 --> 02:04:08.912]  I was told you disagreed.
[02:04:08.912 --> 02:04:10.813]  Sounds like you just differed a bit, but that's fine.
[02:04:10.813 --> 02:04:11.373]  I love to hear it.
[02:04:11.373 --> 02:04:11.873]  God bless you.
[02:04:11.873 --> 02:04:13.813]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:16.074]  And I'm not even demonizing all these people that are trying to come up.
[02:04:16.954 --> 02:04:28.424]  But they are hand-picked by the UN and vetted and brainwashed, and maybe 5% is women and children who they just hold up as a vanguard to move forward, while they throw rocks at helicopters and attack police.
[02:04:28.424 --> 02:04:31.327]  That in one minute!
[02:04:31.327 --> 02:04:36.932]  And then, I will go to your phone calls, and I will also, on the other side of this quick break,
[02:04:39.446 --> 02:04:40.346]  It too.
[02:04:40.346 --> 02:04:41.807]  That's right.
[02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.288]  It's not okay to be white, folks.
[02:04:43.288 --> 02:04:43.668]  I agree.
[02:04:43.668 --> 02:04:46.009]  I agree with Don Lemon and the New York Times.
[02:04:46.009 --> 02:04:47.849]  Whites are inherently evil.
[02:04:47.849 --> 02:04:49.970]  Martin Luther King was wrong.
[02:04:49.970 --> 02:04:52.971]  You don't look at people based on what they stand for and do.
[02:04:52.971 --> 02:04:54.472]  It's all about what color you are.
[02:04:54.472 --> 02:04:55.112]  And whites are bad.
[02:04:56.161 --> 02:05:05.451]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.451 --> 02:05:08.334]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:14.361]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.041 --> 02:05:21.287]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.287 --> 02:05:27.593]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.593 --> 02:05:34.520]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:48.687]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.687 --> 02:05:52.949]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.949 --> 02:05:55.670]  X3, now available at mfortworthslife.com.
[02:05:55.670 --> 02:06:03.373]  21st century war.
[02:06:05.819 --> 02:06:08.802]  You're witnessing the attempt to take down the Republic.
[02:06:08.802 --> 02:06:14.406]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.406 --> 02:06:16.128]  Folks, we've got some really great news.
[02:06:16.128 --> 02:06:17.069]  We got your phone calls here.
[02:06:18.424 --> 02:06:27.531]  There are evil Americans trying to stop Beto and George Soros who have been caught funding the caravan and the UN and MasterCard funding them.
[02:06:27.531 --> 02:06:34.676]  We have undercover video that these evil people shot showing the treason, I mean the lovingness of Beto.
[02:06:34.676 --> 02:06:37.097]  What a monster this guy is!
[02:06:37.097 --> 02:06:41.340]  It's up on InfoWars.com, Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, almost the first hour.
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:44.683]  Please get it out to everybody you know right now.
[02:06:46.096 --> 02:06:50.780]  And get out to these veto events with signs, you name it.
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:53.322]  Exposing the fact that he's done this, it is incredible.
[02:06:53.322 --> 02:06:59.927]  And then you've got the New York Times, the Washington Post, Michael Moore, I haven't even played the clip yet, saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:06:59.927 --> 02:07:03.810]  This is the nastiness of these people.
[02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:05.071]  Let's play Michael Moore first.
[02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:11.081]  Going on the nightly news shows, the nightly comedy shows, spewing this crap.
[02:07:11.081 --> 02:07:17.725]  No, they know that immigrants, either legal or illegal, don't like communism or socialism.
[02:07:17.725 --> 02:07:19.166]  They know the free market works.
[02:07:19.166 --> 02:07:21.167]  They don't want to be on welfare on average.
[02:07:21.167 --> 02:07:24.709]  So they're going to go with race-based class warfare.
[02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:29.892]  And you look at the New York Times and all of them saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:07:29.892 --> 02:07:31.393]  This is just outrageous.
[02:07:31.393 --> 02:07:32.954]  It's so clear what they're doing.
[02:07:34.343 --> 02:07:47.833]  But then meanwhile, somebody puts up, it's okay to be white, and proud virtue signaling people in Fort Worth go pull it down when it's a counter to what the leftists are doing, inherently saying whites are bad.
[02:07:47.833 --> 02:07:52.636]  If people were saying blacks were inherently bad, it'd be okay to say blacks are okay.
[02:07:52.636 --> 02:07:54.597]  It's okay to be human.
[02:07:54.597 --> 02:07:55.878]  But see, you can't do that.
[02:07:55.878 --> 02:07:57.840]  Think about how crazy that is.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.361]  Like, it's okay to be Jewish.
[02:08:00.615 --> 02:08:01.655]  It's okay to be black.
[02:08:01.655 --> 02:08:03.296]  It's okay to be Islamic.
[02:08:03.296 --> 02:08:05.436]  But don't say it's okay to be white.
[02:08:05.436 --> 02:08:07.497]  Because Michael Moore will get upset.
[02:08:07.497 --> 02:08:09.458]  Here he is.
[02:08:09.458 --> 02:08:14.419]  But they are fanatical about this because they know their time is up.
[02:08:14.419 --> 02:08:19.860]  And this sort of the angry white guy, which actually I'm really Trump's demographic.
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:21.921]  Yeah, you're a Michigan angry white guy.
[02:08:21.921 --> 02:08:24.762]  I'm an angry white guy over 50 with a high school education.
[02:08:25.382 --> 02:08:26.263]  So that's me.
[02:08:26.263 --> 02:08:34.650]  So if I could just speak to my fellow angry white American guys who are semi-uneducated like me.
[02:08:34.650 --> 02:08:35.811]  Dudes!
[02:08:35.811 --> 02:08:37.853]  Give it up!
[02:08:37.853 --> 02:08:41.556]  We've been running the show for 10,000 years!
[02:08:41.556 --> 02:08:42.717]  It's like...
[02:08:43.397 --> 02:08:54.722]  It's like, we've had a long run as men, running everything, and the Yankees could never win as many pennants as we've won in these 10,000 years as men.
[02:08:54.722 --> 02:08:57.304]  So, why don't we just take a break?
[02:08:57.304 --> 02:09:00.185]  Let the majority gender run the show.
[02:09:00.185 --> 02:09:02.686]  Just to see how it would go.
[02:09:02.686 --> 02:09:06.208]  What are you scared of?
[02:09:06.208 --> 02:09:08.809]  So, I've never seen such pandering in my life.
[02:09:09.707 --> 02:09:16.052]  That's the whole Hillary line, that women are going to empower things, as if men and women are different, and that we're not together.
[02:09:16.052 --> 02:09:25.359]  And that, just open your borders up to Islam, where women are slaves, and then this idea that white people have been running the show for 10,000 years?
[02:09:25.359 --> 02:09:27.841]  Excuse me?
[02:09:27.841 --> 02:09:36.427]  I mean, up until about 500 years ago, Africa was running Africa, Asia was running Asia, and a few empires were running white people, and it was all diverse groups.
[02:09:36.427 --> 02:09:38.409]  Just the way they dumb this down,
[02:09:40.049 --> 02:09:45.253]  And the way they push this agenda is so countervailing reality.
[02:09:45.253 --> 02:09:47.354]  And then as if whites are bad.
[02:09:47.354 --> 02:09:53.379]  Why is everybody trying to get into the white areas if Europeans are so bad?
[02:09:53.379 --> 02:09:56.441]  Again, and... Oh, give it up!
[02:09:56.441 --> 02:09:58.523]  Venezuela just collapsed!
[02:09:58.523 --> 02:10:02.906]  And they're coming this way, so let's let them run things!
[02:10:02.906 --> 02:10:05.168]  Yeah, get on welfare... No.
[02:10:05.168 --> 02:10:05.608]  Here's the key.
[02:10:07.648 --> 02:10:22.084]  Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jack Dorsey, George Soros, all these billionaires like Oprah Winfrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:10:22.084 --> 02:10:22.585]  He's a billionaire.
[02:10:24.648 --> 02:10:27.269]  It's good to have open borders, yeah, I like it.
[02:10:27.269 --> 02:10:29.969]  I wear Hitler belt too.
[02:10:29.969 --> 02:10:40.531]  They're just using race-based politics, because if you think third world populations are more altruistic and higher and mightier than Christian Europeans, boy, you're in for a grave mistake.
[02:10:40.531 --> 02:10:48.672]  They can't get their act together killing each other, and they're coming up here like locusts.
[02:10:48.672 --> 02:10:51.493]  And they're going to be organized by George Soros and company.
[02:10:53.254 --> 02:10:55.479]  Who said this is the plan to conquer?
[02:10:55.479 --> 02:10:58.326]  But you got another late-night host looking at Michael Moore.
[02:10:58.326 --> 02:11:02.095]  Yeah, let's give women a chance to run things, as if women haven't been running things for a minute.
[02:11:02.095 --> 02:11:02.576]  We're humans.
[02:11:03.533 --> 02:11:04.594]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:11:04.594 --> 02:11:22.345]  No, it's big mega-banks and big tech companies that are tax-exempt, mainly a bunch of old evil white men with a bunch of evil Chinese men who suppress their own people, who are organizing third-world populations to use the fact that we have voting to bring them in, make them dependent, and have them vote to destroy their future!
[02:11:22.345 --> 02:11:27.568]  Michael Moore doesn't say, let's give the Chinese communists, almost all males, running slave factories.
[02:11:27.568 --> 02:11:31.491]  Let's leave your women and your peasants a chance to run things, which would be a good idea, actually.
[02:11:32.171 --> 02:11:35.754]  No, oh no, he doesn't talk about people that killed five times what Hitler did.
[02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:39.578]  It's all about America's bad and you need to roll over and have race bases.
[02:11:39.578 --> 02:11:46.404]  This guy's giving you a Hitler lesson in how race-based systems are good and whites are bad.
[02:11:46.404 --> 02:11:51.268]  It's all going on in front of you like you're an idiot.
[02:11:51.268 --> 02:11:55.151]  What a monstrous pig.
[02:11:55.151 --> 02:11:56.612]  Huge article, InfoWars.com.
[02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:03.331]  It's okay to be white signs pop up in Fort Worth neighborhood.
[02:12:03.331 --> 02:12:08.153]  Origin of the signs and the intended meaning of the words a mystery.
[02:12:08.153 --> 02:12:09.013]  Laugh out loud.
[02:12:09.013 --> 02:12:11.395]  No, you're saying whites are bad.
[02:12:11.395 --> 02:12:13.256]  All, I mean, hundreds of articles a day.
[02:12:13.256 --> 02:12:14.896]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:12:14.896 --> 02:12:15.957]  The white problem.
[02:12:15.957 --> 02:12:16.457]  Opinion.
[02:12:16.457 --> 02:12:17.738]  Can we replace them?
[02:12:17.738 --> 02:12:20.239]  New York Times.
[02:12:20.239 --> 02:12:20.839]  Bill Kristol.
[02:12:20.839 --> 02:12:22.000]  Lazy white working class.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:22.460]  The problem.
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:23.220]  We need to replace them.
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.141]  New York Times.
[02:12:24.141 --> 02:12:25.582]  Replacing white people.
[02:12:25.582 --> 02:12:26.022]  The key.
[02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:30.413]  And don't worry, this old white lady, she watches TV all day.
[02:12:30.413 --> 02:12:31.974]  How can I cure my white guilt?
[02:12:31.974 --> 02:12:33.455]  Get rid of whites, New York Times.
[02:12:33.455 --> 02:12:35.477]  People are like, hey, it's okay to be white!
[02:12:35.477 --> 02:12:39.180]  Imagine if there was everywhere on TV, it's blacks are inherently evil, they're inherently bad.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:43.623]  I'd be like, it's okay to be black, but you don't say it about white.
[02:12:43.623 --> 02:12:51.770]  We ought to do a test where we hang up signs that say it's okay to be Jewish, it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black, and it's okay to be Muslim.
[02:12:52.984 --> 02:12:54.284]  It's okay to be Buddhist.
[02:12:54.284 --> 02:12:57.585]  And I guarantee you, if you have vans and hidden cameras, we're going to do this.
[02:12:57.585 --> 02:13:06.728]  Man, the white people are going to come out and they're going to just go, pull on the white ones and then run over to the black ones and go, oh, because this is about cuckolding.
[02:13:06.728 --> 02:13:09.009]  Here is the CBS News report that's on InfoWars.com.
[02:13:10.425 --> 02:13:17.171]  Owners in one North Fort Worth neighborhood woke up to an unsettling sight, and now they can't figure out if it was a prank or something more.
[02:13:17.171 --> 02:13:18.592]  Penn Molestino has joined us.
[02:13:18.592 --> 02:13:22.295]  At the very least, this thing, Ken, I saw the signs, it's concerning.
[02:13:22.295 --> 02:13:23.035]  I saw at least.
[02:13:23.035 --> 02:13:26.278]  They're wondering why, you know, and exactly what was the intention.
[02:13:26.278 --> 02:13:26.978]  I saw them.
[02:13:26.978 --> 02:13:28.219]  The neighborhood seemed to have been tagged.
[02:13:28.219 --> 02:13:28.840]  Hit pause.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:35.885]  To cause a debate that you people are an anti-white cult, and we've all just accepted this super-Hitlerian, anti-Martin Luther King garbage?
[02:13:35.885 --> 02:13:36.626]  Here, let's play it again.
[02:13:36.626 --> 02:13:37.367]  This is so insane.
[02:13:38.107 --> 02:13:42.912]  People woke up to something really unsettling today, okay?
[02:13:42.912 --> 02:13:49.438]  Now, every newspaper says wives are inherently evil and it's above Hitler, but somebody didn't- why did they do it?
[02:13:49.438 --> 02:13:52.421]  To show what a cult you people are!
[02:13:52.421 --> 02:13:54.763]  How you corporate media regurgitate this crap!
[02:13:54.763 --> 02:13:55.804]  Here it is!
[02:13:55.804 --> 02:14:02.551]  Voters in one North Fort Worth neighborhood woke up to an unsettling sight and now they can't figure out if it was a prank or something more.
[02:14:02.671 --> 02:14:04.032]  Senator Malacina has joined us.
[02:14:04.032 --> 02:14:07.614]  At the very least, this thing, Ken, I saw the signs, it's concerning.
[02:14:07.614 --> 02:14:08.475]  At the least.
[02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:12.398]  They're wondering why, you know, and exactly what was the intention in all of this.
[02:14:12.398 --> 02:14:16.321]  The neighborhood seemed to have been tagged with handfuls of signs printed on paper.
[02:14:16.321 --> 02:14:19.383]  Those signs read, it's okay to be white.
[02:14:19.383 --> 02:14:20.604]  That's what was printed on them.
[02:14:20.604 --> 02:14:22.185]  But no one knows who put them up.
[02:14:23.274 --> 02:14:24.254]  Somebody tell Don Lemon.
[02:14:24.254 --> 02:14:28.296]  Here's what it looked like along Waverly Lane in North Fort Worth early Thursday morning.
[02:14:28.296 --> 02:14:36.600]  Cell phone video and pictures taken of the area show the signs reading, it's okay to be white, posted onto lampposts and other pieces of public property.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:42.223]  By the time we got there, all of the signs except for this one were gone, but it didn't stay up too much longer.
[02:14:42.223 --> 02:14:42.743]  Oh good.
[02:14:42.743 --> 02:14:46.645]  I'm about as white and as old as you're gonna get in this neighborhood.
[02:14:47.706 --> 02:14:48.387]  Yay!
[02:14:48.387 --> 02:14:49.088]  Get rid of free speech!
[02:14:49.088 --> 02:14:49.168]  Yay!
[02:14:49.168 --> 02:14:50.130]  But it's not okay to be white.
[02:15:04.662 --> 02:15:11.026]  What no one seems to be able to answer is who put them up and what exactly was the intention of the message.
[02:15:11.026 --> 02:15:11.986]  Martin Luther King said that.
[02:15:11.986 --> 02:15:13.127]  That's how brainwashed she is.
[02:15:13.127 --> 02:15:17.850]  She pulls them down because, lady, everywhere the corporate media is saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:15:17.850 --> 02:15:24.614]  It's literally Hitler stuff upside down, run by the New York Times and Carlos Slim.
[02:15:24.614 --> 02:15:27.376]  So that we all hate ourselves and then, OK, overrun me.
[02:15:27.376 --> 02:15:28.016]  I'm your slave.
[02:15:28.016 --> 02:15:28.416]  I'm white.
[02:15:28.416 --> 02:15:30.578]  It's like Folsom Doom says, come to me, my child.
[02:15:31.564 --> 02:15:32.044]  You're white!
[02:15:32.044 --> 02:15:33.726]  And I'm like, oh my gosh!
[02:15:33.726 --> 02:15:34.207]  I'm sorry!
[02:15:34.207 --> 02:15:34.867]  Whatever you say!
[02:15:34.867 --> 02:15:36.769]  Everything's yours!
[02:15:36.769 --> 02:15:38.591]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[02:15:38.591 --> 02:15:39.432]  That's it!
[02:15:39.432 --> 02:15:40.373]  I've been busy, I've done it.
[02:15:40.373 --> 02:15:42.835]  I'm festooning everywhere, on video.
[02:15:42.835 --> 02:15:44.217]  But it's okay to be white science.
[02:15:44.217 --> 02:15:46.299]  And I'm doing it today!
[02:15:46.299 --> 02:15:48.000]  I'm going crazy!
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.582]  Everyone do it!
[02:15:49.582 --> 02:15:52.605]  God almighty, this is insane!
[02:15:52.605 --> 02:15:54.387]  Meanwhile, Oprah Winfrey wants to exterminate black people.
[02:15:55.194 --> 02:16:01.538]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:16:01.538 --> 02:16:04.580]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:10.504]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:16:10.504 --> 02:16:14.287]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:16:14.287 --> 02:16:15.568]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:16:15.568 --> 02:16:16.909]  Who do we fight for?
[02:16:16.909 --> 02:16:23.113]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:16:23.113 --> 02:16:24.534]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:16:25.254 --> 02:16:31.939]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[02:16:55.314 --> 02:16:56.535]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.535 --> 02:17:00.456]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.456 --> 02:17:01.997]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.997 --> 02:17:04.958]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.958 --> 02:17:10.521]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.521 --> 02:17:11.721]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.721 --> 02:17:14.663]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.663 --> 02:17:16.884]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:24.958 --> 02:17:31.724]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[02:17:31.724 --> 02:17:36.007]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[02:17:56.437 --> 02:18:00.679]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:18:00.679 --> 02:18:04.161]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.161 --> 02:18:05.942]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:05.942 --> 02:18:09.204]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.204 --> 02:18:15.988]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:15.988 --> 02:18:21.071]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:18:21.511 --> 02:18:27.513]  The globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.513 --> 02:18:30.494]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.494 --> 02:18:31.594]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.594 --> 02:18:35.415]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.415 --> 02:18:37.436]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.436 --> 02:18:38.736]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.736 --> 02:18:41.457]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.457 --> 02:18:43.878]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:44.378 --> 02:18:45.519]  I will never falter.
[02:18:45.519 --> 02:18:48.040]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:48.980]  I physically will.
[02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:56.163]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:18:56.163 --> 02:19:04.547]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.547 --> 02:19:05.007]  Believe me.
[02:19:05.387 --> 02:19:10.691]  I know, I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.691 --> 02:19:15.955]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.955 --> 02:19:30.166]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive.
[02:19:30.546 --> 02:19:36.609]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.609 --> 02:19:40.592]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:19:40.592 --> 02:19:44.274]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:19:44.274 --> 02:19:49.256]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:19:49.256 --> 02:19:51.998]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:19:51.998 --> 02:19:54.459]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:59.276 --> 02:20:09.184]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.184 --> 02:20:16.189]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.189 --> 02:20:17.390]  Alex Baldwin!
[02:20:18.536 --> 02:20:22.138]  You'll be very useful to me.
[02:20:22.138 --> 02:20:25.039]  I just heard Alec Baldwin got arrested.
[02:20:25.039 --> 02:20:27.340]  And I asked, and I wasn't surprised why.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:29.721]  Fighting over a parking space.
[02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:40.686]  Well, I'm sure the 600 million illegals the UN officially wants to bring in in the next 20 years will make it easier for you to find parking spots there, buddy.
[02:20:40.686 --> 02:20:41.267]  Hilarious.
[02:20:41.267 --> 02:20:42.347]  Let's get serious, though.
[02:20:42.347 --> 02:20:45.068]  Going right back to your calls, but I haven't finished this video.
[02:20:45.068 --> 02:20:47.530]  The real grand finale in Fort Worth is
[02:20:48.891 --> 02:20:53.195]  Fort Worthians woke up this morning to terrible, horrible Nazi evil.
[02:20:53.195 --> 02:20:55.657]  That white people are okay.
[02:20:55.657 --> 02:20:58.260]  Even though it's in the New York Times, I just showed you that we're inherently evil.
[02:20:58.260 --> 02:20:59.561]  We're the worst thing on earth.
[02:20:59.561 --> 02:21:01.323]  Michael Moore, we could just go away and die.
[02:21:01.323 --> 02:21:05.807]  Oprah Winfrey, just old white people just die.
[02:21:05.807 --> 02:21:08.770]  Die, die, die, my darling.
[02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:10.692]  Don't say a single word.
[02:21:12.025 --> 02:21:14.866]  And so here's the grand finale of that, and we'll go back to your calls.
[02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:26.969]  Here is the leftist race-baiting orgy with a bunch of virtue-signaling white people falling over themselves to fall off a rhetorical cliff.
[02:21:26.969 --> 02:21:30.250]  District 4 Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:39.793]  I condemn any type of literature, sign that is posted, that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:21:39.793 --> 02:21:40.573]  Oh, and pause again!
[02:21:41.696 --> 02:22:09.328]  I'm against any literature, posting, you just, if somebody finds it offensive, well I find your big ol' ugly cracker head, and that stupid ass UT Longhorn thing you've got on your shirt, another butt-kissing establishment wannabe Texan, your family probably just got her like 10 years ago, but you go, I'm a big ol' tough Texan over here, I don't like nothing that people don't like, so anybody don't like it.
[02:22:09.328 --> 02:22:10.129]  I'm offended.
[02:22:11.578 --> 02:22:14.439]  By that Bevo on your shirt.
[02:22:14.439 --> 02:22:15.459]  I'm not really.
[02:22:15.459 --> 02:22:20.281]  My family all went to UT, but the point is, I'm offended by that!
[02:22:20.281 --> 02:22:22.382]  Now take it off!
[02:22:22.382 --> 02:22:24.563]  Like a white kid in a Black Panther outfit.
[02:22:24.563 --> 02:22:27.944]  One person was offended, they got rid of it!
[02:22:27.944 --> 02:22:29.445]  That was Mark Dyson, it was a joke.
[02:22:29.445 --> 02:22:31.226]  You people are sick!
[02:22:31.226 --> 02:22:32.026]  God Almighty!
[02:22:34.605 --> 02:22:37.246]  Let's hear from him again.
[02:22:37.246 --> 02:22:37.707]  Go ahead.
[02:22:37.707 --> 02:22:40.688]  District 4 Councilman Cary Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:22:40.688 --> 02:22:46.531]  That could be any type of literature sign that... Start over again.
[02:22:46.531 --> 02:22:49.152]  Cary Moon's not taking it lightly.
[02:22:49.152 --> 02:23:01.879]  Now they're in every publication in the country saying white people are inherently evil and it's a bunch of weird commie professors doing it who almost every one of them is a gut-flexing fat-ass white dude.
[02:23:03.749 --> 02:23:07.632]  With a ding-dong you can't find with magnifying glass.
[02:23:07.632 --> 02:23:13.695]  But because they told everybody what's real, people are starting to say, stop saying that.
[02:23:13.695 --> 02:23:14.836]  Well, I don't like it.
[02:23:14.836 --> 02:23:17.678]  And I ain't taking it down lightly.
[02:23:17.678 --> 02:23:23.082]  I'd love to walk into that guy's office and say, what freaking planet do you live on, you idiot?
[02:23:23.082 --> 02:23:28.065]  That if anybody's offended by anything, I don't take it lightly.
[02:23:29.192 --> 02:23:31.153]  Well, let me tell you something, boy.
[02:23:31.153 --> 02:23:32.753]  I don't take people like you lightly.
[02:23:32.753 --> 02:23:36.415]  You're crapping all over our country, you piece of crap!
[02:23:36.415 --> 02:23:38.236]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:38.236 --> 02:23:44.999]  And I really don't like fake Texas Tuk-Tuv.
[02:23:44.999 --> 02:23:46.119]  Sorry.
[02:23:46.119 --> 02:23:47.560]  The election's gotten a little bit fired up.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.560]  We control ourselves.
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:51.921]  We don't want to fully transform.
[02:23:51.921 --> 02:23:52.662]  Let's go back to him.
[02:23:52.662 --> 02:23:52.962]  Here he is.
[02:23:54.602 --> 02:23:57.804]  District 4 Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:23:57.804 --> 02:24:07.449]  That could be any type of literature, a sign that is posted, that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:24:07.449 --> 02:24:18.655]  All of this comes on the heels of a recent report sent to council members about anti-immigrant activity in other parts of the city involving, quote, the placement of defamatory banners and flyers on public property.
[02:24:18.655 --> 02:24:20.116]  There's just not a place for this.
[02:24:20.116 --> 02:24:20.636]  Hit the pause again.
[02:24:21.016 --> 02:24:23.698]  Yeah, America's not a place for free speech.
[02:24:23.698 --> 02:24:33.684]  Fort Worth probably shipped in 500,000 illegal aliens the last few years, and they're all over the place, sleeping in your backyard and crapping on your front porch.
[02:24:33.684 --> 02:24:38.727]  And some people in America believe you can say something about that.
[02:24:38.727 --> 02:24:41.208]  We ain't gonna stand for it.
[02:24:41.208 --> 02:24:47.272]  And we're really glad there's censoring everybody.
[02:24:47.272 --> 02:24:48.012]  I said I got to get calls.
[02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:48.533]  I'm out of control.
[02:24:49.397 --> 02:24:52.764]  But just, this guy is the most triggering baboon butt I've ever seen.
[02:24:52.764 --> 02:24:53.405]  Let's go back to it.
[02:24:55.247 --> 02:25:01.553]  Well the councilman said this kind of activity is considered a class C misdemeanor and those responsible could face a citation.
[02:25:01.553 --> 02:25:11.042]  He also said instead of ripping the signs down neighbors should call police immediately and leave those signs up since they are considered to be evidence and then just let the police investigate the situation.
[02:25:11.042 --> 02:25:13.284]  I think I'm gonna call the police on myself.
[02:25:13.284 --> 02:25:15.286]  Yes 9-1-1.
[02:25:15.286 --> 02:25:19.049]  You never arrest anybody else putting up stuff for rock bands or for you know
[02:25:20.683 --> 02:25:36.609]  Whatever the case may be, maybe a garage sale, maybe a lemonade stand, but you know, if somebody has political speech that's the most protected, well we gotta shut that down right now.
[02:25:36.609 --> 02:25:38.769]  As long as we don't act like this.
[02:25:38.769 --> 02:25:44.091]  There's this thing of people who want to act like they're from the South or Texas where they do it more and more like a virtue signal.
[02:25:44.091 --> 02:25:46.132]  So it's like, hang on there.
[02:25:48.255 --> 02:25:51.377]  I think I'm going to go to, that's it, I'm going to Fort Worth.
[02:25:51.377 --> 02:25:52.218]  I can't help it.
[02:25:52.218 --> 02:25:52.758]  I've got to do it.
[02:25:52.758 --> 02:25:54.059]  I've got to do it myself there.
[02:25:54.059 --> 02:25:55.560]  I've got to see this guy.
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:58.302]  I mean, this guy is a, oh my God.
[02:25:58.302 --> 02:26:00.864]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:00.864 --> 02:26:04.526]  Just finish it and I promise I'm going to your calls after the break.
[02:26:04.526 --> 02:26:05.847]  I swear I'm a bad person.
[02:26:05.847 --> 02:26:07.388]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:26:07.388 --> 02:26:08.249]  Just please go to it.
[02:26:10.066 --> 02:26:12.227]  Councilman Kerry Moon isn't taking it lightly.
[02:26:12.227 --> 02:26:22.113]  I condemn any type of literature, sign that is posted, that may be offensive to some folks.
[02:26:22.113 --> 02:26:33.279]  All of this comes on the heels of a recent report sent to council members about anti-immigrant activity in other parts of the city involving, quote, the placement of defamatory banners and flyers on public property.
[02:26:33.279 --> 02:26:35.781]  There's just not a place for this in Fort Worth.
[02:26:35.781 --> 02:26:38.242]  And it's not indicative of the true forest spirit.
[02:26:39.335 --> 02:26:45.618]  Well, the councilman said this kind of activity is considered a class C misdemeanor and those responsible could face a citation.
[02:26:45.618 --> 02:26:54.543]  He also said instead of ripping the signs down, neighbors should call police immediately and leave those signs up since they are considered to be evidence and then just let the police investigate.
[02:26:54.543 --> 02:27:04.609]  Yeah, when you get a couple hundred thousand people attacking police with kidnapped kids, running around screaming, we're criminals, we're gonna kill cops when we get there, funded by international groups, you just let them walk through.
[02:27:05.834 --> 02:27:14.316]  But if somebody tried Texas to put up a sign, you call police.
[02:27:14.316 --> 02:27:18.956]  Just like Europe, where for 10 years you bitch about your daughter being raped, you get arrested.
[02:27:18.956 --> 02:27:21.437]  You fight somebody trying to rape your wife, you go to jail.
[02:27:21.437 --> 02:27:25.077]  Let me, let's just pull this sign down right here.
[02:27:25.077 --> 02:27:26.018]  What the hell?
[02:27:26.018 --> 02:27:28.458]  You think this is America?
[02:27:28.458 --> 02:27:31.519]  White people are not okay.
[02:27:31.519 --> 02:27:33.559]  Is that clear, boy?
[02:27:35.404 --> 02:27:35.805]  Look at her!
[02:27:35.805 --> 02:27:37.026]  She'll show your ass!
[02:27:37.026 --> 02:27:37.827]  Look at that!
[02:27:37.827 --> 02:27:41.051]  I guess she kind of gets that gunslinger stance after she pulls it down.
[02:27:41.051 --> 02:27:41.551]  She can't wait.
[02:27:41.551 --> 02:27:44.895]  She's like, yeah, well, I'm a good person.
[02:27:44.895 --> 02:27:48.480]  First Amendment, wipe my big old butt with that right now.
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.384]  Hey, boy.
[02:27:52.384 --> 02:27:53.526]  God, we're screwed.
[02:27:58.757 --> 02:27:59.798]  I hadn't seen this.
[02:27:59.798 --> 02:28:01.899]  I saw the Drudge Link this morning and didn't click it.
[02:28:01.899 --> 02:28:02.720]  I didn't have time.
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:05.962]  I was dealing with the kid stuff.
[02:28:05.962 --> 02:28:07.743]  You told me I have to play it.
[02:28:07.743 --> 02:28:10.665]  It's the most insane crap I've ever seen.
[02:28:10.665 --> 02:28:12.606]  These people.
[02:28:12.606 --> 02:28:13.487]  Oh my God.
[02:28:13.487 --> 02:28:16.208]  I think they may conquer Texas.
[02:28:16.208 --> 02:28:17.189]  I just, I don't know.
[02:28:17.189 --> 02:28:20.771]  But fine, let everybody go to hell.
[02:28:20.771 --> 02:28:22.993]  At a certain point, good Lord.
[02:28:33.579 --> 02:28:36.060]  Call the police immediately!
[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:41.521]  We got people exercising free speech around here against the rape gangs.
[02:28:41.521 --> 02:28:42.941]  We ain't gonna put up with that.
[02:28:42.941 --> 02:28:46.582]  Alright, I'm a bad person, but I'll go to your calls.
[02:28:46.582 --> 02:28:53.264]  If the hair lifts the admiral and the water don't rise over Bear Creek straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:28:55.475 --> 02:28:56.676]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.676 --> 02:29:00.599]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.599 --> 02:29:02.140]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:05.103]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.103 --> 02:29:10.667]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.667 --> 02:29:11.868]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.868 --> 02:29:14.810]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:17.032]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:17.032 --> 02:29:21.475]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:13.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:13.972 --> 02:33:15.273]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.273 --> 02:33:24.180]  Alright, I'm going to write your calls down.
[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:29.944]  I really appreciate everybody holding.
[02:33:29.944 --> 02:33:36.049]  I'll go a little bit in the next hour to take some time away from the great Joel Gilbert so I get to all of you.
[02:33:36.049 --> 02:33:38.071]  But, this is very cut and dry.
[02:33:39.142 --> 02:33:51.453]  Our Christian open society that Europe and the United States ended slavery worldwide except for some areas of Islam, which the left totally ignores, and communist China.
[02:33:51.453 --> 02:33:53.354]  And then they sit there and tell us how we're bad all day.
[02:33:53.354 --> 02:33:59.880]  They have all these weird virtue signaling white people strutting around on television.
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:02.262]  It's like Monty Python comedy.
[02:34:02.262 --> 02:34:03.443]  This is super dangerous.
[02:34:03.443 --> 02:34:04.404]  This is super bad.
[02:34:04.404 --> 02:34:05.565]  These people are out of control.
[02:34:07.421 --> 02:34:10.243]  Now, tomorrow, 3 p.m.
[02:34:10.243 --> 02:34:23.775]  Central, and probably earlier if the false flag or something goes off, we've got people live on the border that are going to be Skyping in, and I'm not going to announce for intel reasons and security reasons where or why, but you'll want to tune in tomorrow, 3 p.m.
[02:34:23.775 --> 02:34:25.196]  Central.
[02:34:25.196 --> 02:34:28.199]  And you can better bet your bottom dollar.
[02:34:28.199 --> 02:34:30.821]  You can bet your boots.
[02:34:30.821 --> 02:34:31.682]  You can bet your horse.
[02:34:33.666 --> 02:34:44.215]  You can bet your horse, your boots, your last dollar, and my right arm, that if I can get on air at midnight tonight, if something happens, I'll be down here.
[02:34:44.215 --> 02:34:47.958]  And you can bet, if something goes off, God forbid, in the morning, I'll be here.
[02:34:47.958 --> 02:34:50.740]  Just watch Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:34:52.930 --> 02:34:59.315]  I'll be here by three tomorrow to go for five, six hours live with a bunch of big guests who've already got lined up and stuff I'm not going to get into on air yet.
[02:34:59.315 --> 02:35:00.596]  So let's go write your phone calls right now.
[02:35:00.596 --> 02:35:03.318]  And then Sunday, the regular four to 6 p.m.
[02:35:03.318 --> 02:35:05.580]  And then we're going to go from 8 a.m.
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:07.582]  to midnight on Monday night.
[02:35:07.582 --> 02:35:12.946]  And then we're going to go for 24 hours.
[02:35:12.946 --> 02:35:13.587]  From 8 a.m.
[02:35:13.587 --> 02:35:14.507]  to 8 a.m.
[02:35:14.507 --> 02:35:17.170]  on Tuesday into Wednesday.
[02:35:17.170 --> 02:35:18.751]  And this will be a day long remembered.
[02:35:21.636 --> 02:35:25.958]  Because if we can beat them here, we're gonna win no matter what.
[02:35:25.958 --> 02:35:31.199]  But if we can beat them, and this midterm is Waterloo, baby.
[02:35:31.199 --> 02:35:34.721]  It's, uh... That's how I go to your calls.
[02:35:34.721 --> 02:35:38.322]  This is such an epic time.
[02:35:38.322 --> 02:35:41.083]  Just choose what side you're on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:41.083 --> 02:35:43.303]  And I know the audience knows that.
[02:35:43.303 --> 02:35:47.405]  I'm talking to people who are part of the power structure, or think they are.
[02:35:47.405 --> 02:35:50.366]  You are not successful because you are a idiot.
[02:35:52.293 --> 02:35:53.615]  Serving the system.
[02:35:53.615 --> 02:35:56.138]  Have you been to Communist China?
[02:35:56.138 --> 02:35:57.479]  Do you know how evil they are?
[02:35:57.479 --> 02:35:58.600]  How cold?
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:04.327]  You know our tech leader allied with them and our bloodthirsty little creeps that pay no taxes and then lecture everybody all day?
[02:36:04.327 --> 02:36:06.590]  These people are horrible!
[02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:11.796]  What type of crazy people would help them?
[02:36:11.796 --> 02:36:12.416]  But I know why.
[02:36:13.362 --> 02:36:17.683]  They offered me a million, they offered me three million, they offered me ten million dollars a year!
[02:36:17.683 --> 02:36:18.804]  And you say, well, why don't you say who?
[02:36:18.804 --> 02:36:22.025]  Well, I mean, I'm a business guy and I'm a journalist.
[02:36:22.025 --> 02:36:28.187]  If something's off-record meeting, it's not criminal, I don't release it.
[02:36:28.187 --> 02:36:30.908]  And I haven't had them try to buy me off in about ten years.
[02:36:30.908 --> 02:36:35.349]  Some of that just started up again.
[02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:39.631]  But, let's just say this.
[02:36:41.713 --> 02:36:48.838]  I hear people that sell out for nothing, and they sell out to be on the local news being traitors to humanity.
[02:36:48.838 --> 02:36:52.320]  And it's pathetic, and it's sick, and it's disgusting.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:37:03.588]  People go, well, God, you turned down $10 million for my children's birthright, and then we made way more than $10 million a year.
[02:37:03.588 --> 02:37:08.832]  But it wasn't $10 million a year so I could drive around in a Ferrari or have a helicopter or a private jet, which I don't have.
[02:37:10.623 --> 02:37:18.827]  It was to take that money and put it back in to try to do something, and try to fight back, and try to change the world, and that's what I'm looking for.
[02:37:18.827 --> 02:37:22.928]  And George Soros, with his hundreds of billions of stolen money, he knows that!
[02:37:22.928 --> 02:37:25.329]  But for evil, he's putting it all down against us!
[02:37:25.329 --> 02:37:30.772]  Well, I've only got millions, thanks to you supporting me, and I'm putting it down on the table!
[02:37:30.772 --> 02:37:34.913]  With my name, my blood, the whole nine yards on it, baby!
[02:37:34.913 --> 02:37:37.234]  Because these guys are pieces of crap.
[02:37:37.234 --> 02:37:38.175]  They're really evil.
[02:37:39.028 --> 02:37:44.051]  So to me, it's not even a hard choice to just go all in against them.
[02:37:44.051 --> 02:37:48.935]  If it was some foreign elite trying to make stuff better and was better than our establishment, I'd say, let's get married to these people.
[02:37:48.935 --> 02:37:49.735]  Let's get in bed with them.
[02:37:49.735 --> 02:37:51.136]  That's what old alliances do.
[02:37:51.136 --> 02:37:55.439]  I'm ready to climb in bed with something good that makes the country and humanity better.
[02:37:55.439 --> 02:37:56.780]  This ain't it, man.
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:59.022]  I ain't getting in bed with that.
[02:37:59.022 --> 02:37:59.942]  You think I want to die?
[02:37:59.942 --> 02:38:01.664]  You think I want to work 18 hours a day?
[02:38:01.664 --> 02:38:03.745]  You think Trump wants to work 20 hours a day?
[02:38:03.745 --> 02:38:05.386]  That titan?
[02:38:05.386 --> 02:38:06.147]  He's a titan!
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:08.662]  They're scared to hell of him.
[02:38:08.662 --> 02:38:13.407]  He only unclothed the last four years and played silly so they'd know what they were dealing with.
[02:38:13.407 --> 02:38:17.972]  The real Donald Trump is fire-breathing liberty.
[02:38:17.972 --> 02:38:24.599]  God sent, as the last doorstop to pure evil, a foot in the door before God closes it.
[02:38:24.599 --> 02:38:25.440]  And you reject Trump?
[02:38:28.754 --> 02:38:30.054]  My spirit's never wrong.
[02:38:30.054 --> 02:38:35.078]  My spirit says, get behind Trump a trillion percent, Jones, and do it now.
[02:38:35.078 --> 02:38:41.121]  And my spirit's like all the time when I intellectually question something, and it's always BS anyways, and I find out Trump's right.
[02:38:41.121 --> 02:38:44.583]  Then I learn later just how right Trump was.
[02:38:44.583 --> 02:38:46.304]  That's why the enemy cannot stand him.
[02:38:46.304 --> 02:38:49.526]  We must get behind Trump, absolutely committed behind him.
[02:38:49.526 --> 02:38:50.247]  Total alignment!
[02:38:54.906 --> 02:38:56.447]  And that's why I said that at the start of the show yesterday.
[02:38:56.447 --> 02:38:59.210]  I said I am in total alignment with the President.
[02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:05.775]  That means total alignment!
[02:39:05.775 --> 02:39:06.916]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call.
[02:39:06.916 --> 02:39:16.044]  It's been all the longest year I've... Let's talk to LaVona in Texas.
[02:39:16.044 --> 02:39:17.045]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:39:17.045 --> 02:39:17.305]  Go ahead.
[02:39:18.817 --> 02:39:24.842]  Hello Alex, I just wanted to say first off the bat, I got a few words for Michael Moore.
[02:39:24.842 --> 02:39:31.748]  It is okay to be white, but it's also okay to wipe them granny beads out from under your chin and find a treadmill.
[02:39:31.748 --> 02:39:43.637]  And I wanted to say that, why all of these military and everything, why can't we just do what they did to everybody at the protest at the Tea Party?
[02:39:43.637 --> 02:39:46.460]  You know, you can use flash bang grenades, you can use the
[02:39:48.291 --> 02:39:50.612]  Sound waves that they use to push people away.
[02:39:50.612 --> 02:39:53.634]  And again, that was leftist police doing that to test it out.
[02:39:53.634 --> 02:39:55.235]  Because exactly, exactly.
[02:39:55.235 --> 02:39:57.136]  And I'm not even saying do that.
[02:39:57.136 --> 02:40:00.498]  But if you don't stem this tide, it's going to collapse all of Latin America into us.
[02:40:00.498 --> 02:40:03.460]  And this is a military attack.
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:04.340]  Yes, I know.
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.662]  And it's good enough for the American citizen.
[02:40:07.662 --> 02:40:10.424]  Why can't we just try that first before we go blowing people away?
[02:40:12.898 --> 02:40:13.679]  No, I agree.
[02:40:13.679 --> 02:40:15.700]  Trump, you understand, he doesn't want to shoot them.
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:26.628]  He's telling them in the rules of war that I consider you a military force, you've hurt people, you've killed people, you're criminal, and if you try to hit us with deadly weapons, we're going to defend ourselves.
[02:40:26.628 --> 02:40:27.809]  It's the right thing to do.
[02:40:27.809 --> 02:40:39.118]  Because Trump knows that there's a good chance they're going to have snipers hidden on the Soros side to shoot a few migrants, a few invaders, to make Trump look bad, so he has to be up front
[02:40:40.017 --> 02:40:40.297]  Amen.
[02:40:59.128 --> 02:41:00.249]  Amen.
[02:41:00.249 --> 02:41:07.394]  And we also know that Trump doesn't like to televise and signal to everybody what his game plan is in the long run.
[02:41:07.394 --> 02:41:08.055]  That's actually true.
[02:41:08.055 --> 02:41:11.858]  It's almost bad what I do, because what I do is I kind of let people in on the Trump dimension.
[02:41:11.858 --> 02:41:12.919]  Not that I even have to talk to Trump.
[02:41:12.919 --> 02:41:14.520]  That's why Trump's really into the show.
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:17.082]  Me and Trump, the enemy already picked up on this three years ago.
[02:41:17.082 --> 02:41:18.583]  It's like we're synced.
[02:41:18.583 --> 02:41:19.404]  Like word for word.
[02:41:19.404 --> 02:41:21.785]  He'll be giving a speech and I'm saying the exact same thing.
[02:41:21.785 --> 02:41:23.086]  I'm not just saying that to act cool.
[02:41:23.086 --> 02:41:24.107]  It's really freaky.
[02:41:24.107 --> 02:41:24.908]  It's getting weird.
[02:41:26.169 --> 02:41:26.429]  All right.
[02:41:26.429 --> 02:41:27.289]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:41:27.289 --> 02:41:29.170]  And I want to say this real quick for you.
[02:41:29.170 --> 02:41:31.971]  I love your Secret 12 and I can't wait to order some more.
[02:41:31.971 --> 02:41:32.451]  Thank you.
[02:41:32.451 --> 02:41:33.351]  God bless your crew.
[02:41:33.351 --> 02:41:34.031]  Thank you, ma'am.
[02:41:34.031 --> 02:41:34.391]  Thank you.
[02:41:34.391 --> 02:41:35.632]  God bless you, sweetheart.
[02:41:35.632 --> 02:41:39.773]  Yeah, it is the best rated vitamin B12 in the country.
[02:41:39.773 --> 02:41:40.713]  BuzzFeed got it.
[02:41:40.713 --> 02:41:42.734]  Sent it to Mark Cuban's testing lab in San Francisco.
[02:41:42.734 --> 02:41:44.694]  They tested everything, found, OK, it's pure.
[02:41:44.694 --> 02:41:46.835]  There's no contaminants, like Jones says.
[02:41:46.835 --> 02:41:49.736]  But here is the best B12 in the world.
[02:41:49.736 --> 02:41:52.397]  And Jones's is more.
[02:41:52.397 --> 02:41:52.877]  Which is a lie.
[02:41:53.936 --> 02:41:57.958]  My B-12 was $10 less and the same stuff, private label.
[02:41:57.958 --> 02:42:05.162]  So they just underhandedly, without knowing, gave me the top rating in the world out of hundreds of Ottoman B-12s tested for Secret 12.
[02:42:05.162 --> 02:42:08.163]  So thanks a lot, Charlie Wurzel, moron.
[02:42:08.163 --> 02:42:14.246]  All right, we're gonna go to break and then I'm gonna get five calls into this next segment.
[02:42:14.246 --> 02:42:14.907]  We're gonna go to Jeff.
[02:42:17.051 --> 02:42:19.854]  Matt, Joshua, Kathy, everybody.
[02:42:19.854 --> 02:42:23.857]  Rich, Andrew, JD, everyone holding, I will get to you.
[02:42:23.857 --> 02:42:28.582]  But speaking of that, we got a Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:42:30.216 --> 02:42:39.299]  But then they explained to us, you need to put the other two types of iodine in, as it ages and it's upload, and a tiny bit of this certain type of vitamin C, keep from oxidizing.
[02:42:39.299 --> 02:42:39.899]  Well, we have it.
[02:42:39.899 --> 02:42:41.220]  The ultimate iodine.
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:42.220]  Tri-Iodine.
[02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:44.041]  Survival Shield 3.
[02:42:44.041 --> 02:42:46.742]  It's now available 50% off and free shipping.
[02:42:46.742 --> 02:42:47.682]  Introductory offer.
[02:42:47.682 --> 02:42:49.203]  DimpleWarStore.com.
[02:42:49.203 --> 02:42:49.683]  With 100% reviews. 100%.
[02:42:55.276 --> 02:43:01.780]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:08.604]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:43:08.604 --> 02:43:24.134]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.

[02:44:53.057 --> 02:45:01.945]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:45:03.658 --> 02:45:06.782]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:45:06.782 --> 02:45:09.465]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:45:09.465 --> 02:45:13.750]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:21.259]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:45:21.259 --> 02:45:23.561]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:27.111 --> 02:45:29.312]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:45:29.312 --> 02:45:32.354]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:45:32.354 --> 02:45:44.282]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:44.282 --> 02:45:45.823]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:45:45.823 --> 02:45:48.685]  Never miss your show, any day.

[02:45:56.553 --> 02:45:59.635]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents knew they canned food.
[02:45:59.635 --> 02:46:02.577]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.577 --> 02:46:05.519]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:05.519 --> 02:46:10.102]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[02:46:11.129 --> 02:46:20.273]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:46:59.246 --> 02:47:01.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:28.171 --> 02:47:29.251]  We're out of Matt right now.
[02:47:29.251 --> 02:47:33.172]  We'll talk about caravan migrants and Jade Helm.
[02:47:33.172 --> 02:47:51.016]  But, again, if you just joined us, even Mastercard.com says they're working with George Soros to fund the caravan and other caravans for years, as they're giving them all $1,000 per leg, which is what I've read in USAID documents that Judicial Watch got.
[02:47:54.025 --> 02:47:58.126]  They have all these articles saying we're insane while it's in the news and admit it.
[02:47:58.126 --> 02:48:02.168]  It's just, it's a tactic.
[02:48:02.168 --> 02:48:03.729]  Where they go, it's good, we're doing it.
[02:48:03.729 --> 02:48:05.069]  We go, well, we don't like that.
[02:48:05.069 --> 02:48:09.150]  Oh, we're not doing that, you're crazy.
[02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:12.012]  And so people start tuning out mainstream media.
[02:48:12.012 --> 02:48:14.973]  And then they just go, we'll just censor everyone.
[02:48:14.973 --> 02:48:15.693]  It's crazy.
[02:48:15.693 --> 02:48:18.274]  These people, I don't see what they're doing working.
[02:48:18.274 --> 02:48:20.335]  Matt in Nebraska, thanks for calling.
[02:48:20.335 --> 02:48:21.255]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:48:21.255 --> 02:48:21.495]  Welcome.
[02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:34.681]  I just wondered if you know any connections with Jade Helms and what's going down with the troops, if it's going to do like what they were talking about, like turning on political dissidents instead of the migrants?
[02:48:34.681 --> 02:48:39.026]  Well that's a great question and that would take hours to get into, but here's what happened four years ago with Jade Helms.
[02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:49.315]  They released the map from CENTCOM that showed Texas is hostile, and conservative Utah is hostile, and Orange County is hostile.
[02:48:49.315 --> 02:48:51.115]  It was meant to provocateur us.
[02:48:51.115 --> 02:48:55.558]  And I said, I believe this is a provocateuring operation to get us to cover it.
[02:48:56.644 --> 02:49:04.269]  Show that we sound anti-military when it says Texas is seen as hostile and that really if you turn it sideways it's a map of the Middle East.
[02:49:04.269 --> 02:49:05.469]  Which at one level it was.
[02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:06.950]  It turned out I was correct.
[02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:10.732]  But it was also mastering the human domain to get the military
[02:49:11.733 --> 02:49:22.462]  To go out and practice working with social media and things during civil unrest or a collapse in the Southwest, because Obama was even claiming it at the time, but he wasn't going to stop the collapse with the immigrant caravans.
[02:49:22.462 --> 02:49:25.445]  But the Border Patrol really didn't follow his orders, so it didn't happen.
[02:49:25.445 --> 02:49:27.206]  It would be to facilitate it.
[02:49:27.206 --> 02:49:34.552]  So it was a multi-layered PSYOP to make us come out against the military, which was super-patriot then, and it's now, for them to know their main mission
[02:49:35.273 --> 02:49:35.393]  Yeah.
[02:49:35.393 --> 02:49:35.633]  And then, uh...
[02:50:03.217 --> 02:50:06.501]  Also, CNN, I always like how they ask their guests.
[02:50:06.501 --> 02:50:15.510]  They're trying to get a guest to agree to Trump saying his rhetoric is the cause of the killings and everything else that's going on in Haiti.
[02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:22.318]  They're just trying to get the one guest to say they agree with him and it's going to throw Trump into impeachment or whatever.
[02:50:22.318 --> 02:50:23.219]  It's ridiculous.
[02:50:25.447 --> 02:50:27.788]  Is anti-semitic or anything else is asinine.
[02:50:27.788 --> 02:50:28.709]  Trump likes people.
[02:50:28.709 --> 02:50:30.510]  He loves black people.
[02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:31.711]  He loves white people.
[02:50:31.711 --> 02:50:32.451]  He loves Asians.
[02:50:32.451 --> 02:50:34.232]  He loves hard-working smart people.
[02:50:34.232 --> 02:50:36.153]  He loves Jews.
[02:50:36.153 --> 02:50:39.255]  The orthodox hard-working Jews he knows and people he loves them.
[02:50:39.255 --> 02:50:42.477]  And so the white supremacists hate Trump because of that.
[02:50:42.477 --> 02:50:45.258]  Well, let's think about this.
[02:50:45.258 --> 02:50:47.440]  Saudi Arabia has trillions of dollars.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:49.421]  It has million, two million person.
[02:50:50.674 --> 02:50:52.595]  Well, let's be technical.
[02:50:52.595 --> 02:51:00.257]  Two 500,000 person camps and one 1,000,000 person camps that can house 2,000,000 people in air-conditioned two-bedroom tents.
[02:51:00.257 --> 02:51:01.017]  No one's in them.
[02:51:01.017 --> 02:51:02.357]  We don't even know what they're for.
[02:51:02.357 --> 02:51:04.158]  They don't take one illegal alien.
[02:51:04.158 --> 02:51:06.378]  They don't take one refugee.
[02:51:06.378 --> 02:51:09.659]  But then we're supposed to take and you're supposed to take millions of these people.
[02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:12.080]  Why are they okay but we're not okay?
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:15.941]  And it's the same thing that we're bad and we're causing violence.
[02:51:15.941 --> 02:51:17.901]  It's just absolute crap.
[02:51:17.901 --> 02:51:18.742]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[02:51:21.303 --> 02:51:36.593]  I'm not here to pay for you in Venezuela who voted for commies and collapsed your country and now you're a mother with 90% men coming up here waving your baby in front of me saying, I hate America, pay for my crap.
[02:51:36.593 --> 02:51:43.278]  While the men with you throw rocks at helicopters because you're a bunch of anti-American trash that was not everybody's trash down there.
[02:51:43.278 --> 02:51:45.279]  They go and they get the worst.
[02:51:45.279 --> 02:51:46.059]  They vet them.
[02:51:46.059 --> 02:51:47.160]  They prepare them.
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:48.281]  They ship them up here.
[02:51:49.793 --> 02:51:51.375]  It's a freaking snake bite, man!
[02:51:51.375 --> 02:51:54.999]  These people are nothing but poison!
[02:51:54.999 --> 02:51:57.061]  If you want to collapse, bring them in!
[02:51:57.061 --> 02:51:59.064]  These are the scum!
[02:51:59.064 --> 02:52:01.666]  You know, just like the Cuban boatlift in, you know, 1980.
[02:52:01.666 --> 02:52:05.451]  They dumped out their mental patients, their criminals, their mentally ill.
[02:52:06.909 --> 02:52:07.489]  Honest.
[02:52:07.489 --> 02:52:09.471]  That's not representative of Cuban-Americans.
[02:52:09.471 --> 02:52:12.754]  People like Ted Cruz are, you know, representative of that.
[02:52:12.754 --> 02:52:13.975]  I love Cubans.
[02:52:13.975 --> 02:52:15.736]  But this is what they do.
[02:52:15.736 --> 02:52:21.841]  This is Fidel Castro and the ghost of Hugo Chavez taking a giant dump on us.
[02:52:21.841 --> 02:52:26.144]  And make no mistake, at least half these people are from Venezuela.
[02:52:26.144 --> 02:52:28.846]  And it's all going to come out.
[02:52:28.846 --> 02:52:30.568]  That's when the first camps were set up.
[02:52:30.568 --> 02:52:33.270]  A year ago, they began the leapfrog invasion force.
[02:52:35.689 --> 02:52:37.049]  Okay, we got callers in Texas.
[02:52:37.049 --> 02:52:37.490]  We got callers.
[02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:39.730]  The problem is there's so many damn callers.
[02:52:39.730 --> 02:52:41.751]  That's a good problem to have.
[02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:46.492]  Let's talk to Jose in Texas.
[02:52:46.492 --> 02:52:48.213]  Or is that Joshua?
[02:52:48.213 --> 02:52:49.113]  Joshua in Texas.
[02:52:49.113 --> 02:52:49.553]  You're on the air.
[02:52:49.553 --> 02:52:51.034]  Go ahead.
[02:52:51.034 --> 02:52:52.034]  Hello.
[02:52:52.034 --> 02:52:53.535]  Welcome.
[02:52:53.535 --> 02:52:56.836]  Yes, this is Joshua.
[02:52:56.836 --> 02:52:58.816]  I'm from Brownsville, Texas.
[02:52:58.816 --> 02:52:59.776]  I'm on the border.
[02:52:59.776 --> 02:53:02.937]  Yes, I know Brownsville well.
[02:53:02.937 --> 02:53:04.698]  One of the issues I was wanting to say is that
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:12.265]  Boca Chica Beach is right next to the Rio Grande River and it's easy for people to cross that area.
[02:53:12.265 --> 02:53:20.211]  I'm thinking we're going to need to have either a Naval or Coast Guard area to be protecting that area because that's an easy area to cross.
[02:53:20.211 --> 02:53:27.257]  By the way, since I was a little kid I got on a Brownsville and would go across to Mexico and now as you know it's not as very safe anymore.
[02:53:27.257 --> 02:53:31.680]  No, I know that for sure because I usually go to fishing there and I have to carry a rifle all the time.
[02:53:33.573 --> 02:53:37.936]  Oh, but you shouldn't be... Beto says you shouldn't have a rifle.
[02:53:37.936 --> 02:53:42.940]  Well, that's why I don't... I didn't vote for him anyway, so... What are people saying with this?
[02:53:42.940 --> 02:53:45.562]  I mean, look, I love it if somebody's really from a community.
[02:53:45.562 --> 02:53:46.843]  He tried to join the Hispanic Caucus.
[02:53:46.843 --> 02:53:47.824]  They said no.
[02:53:47.824 --> 02:53:48.985]  And I don't think it's Irish folks.
[02:53:48.985 --> 02:53:49.565]  I'm part Irish.
[02:53:49.565 --> 02:53:52.968]  But an Irish guy, 6'4", saying he's Mexican.
[02:53:52.968 --> 02:53:56.090]  I've heard the Hispanics are really rejecting this fakeness.
[02:53:56.090 --> 02:53:58.932]  Because Ted Cruz doesn't try to sit there and say, oh, look, I'm Latino.
[02:53:58.932 --> 02:53:59.713]  He's just an American.
[02:53:59.713 --> 02:54:02.715]  But people see, authentically, what are people saying about Beto?
[02:54:03.806 --> 02:54:09.289]  Well, I've seen a lot of people posting up signs here in Brownsville to support him and everything.
[02:54:09.289 --> 02:54:16.552]  I haven't really asked many people about questions of that, but there's a lot of people here that do support Trump down here and Ted Cruz.
[02:54:16.552 --> 02:54:18.753]  I agree, but they're scared to say it, aren't they?
[02:54:19.639 --> 02:54:24.641]  Yeah, like, well, we can't even say it because we have neighbors next to us that are anti-Trump supporters.
[02:54:24.641 --> 02:54:25.121]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:31.964]  If I was Hispanic, and I like Beato's, Beatoff's, uh, policies better, I would go for him.
[02:54:31.964 --> 02:54:40.927]  But if he virtues signal, imagine if I was Alex Jones my whole life, and then I run for office in the Valley, and I say, I'm, I'm, I'm Alejandro.
[02:54:40.927 --> 02:54:44.188]  It's, it's, it's patron, it's, it's, it's a cheap trick.
[02:54:44.188 --> 02:54:46.469]  It's, it's, it's gross.
[02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:48.870]  I guess it doesn't work on me because I'm also half Asian, so.
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:54.503]  Man, all I know is I'm half free and the other half wants to be free.
[02:54:54.503 --> 02:54:55.043]  God bless you.
[02:54:55.043 --> 02:54:57.025]  I appreciate your call, Joshua.
[02:54:57.025 --> 02:55:01.408]  Okay, let's talk to Kathy in Oklahoma.
[02:55:01.408 --> 02:55:02.029]  Kathy, you're on the air.
[02:55:02.029 --> 02:55:02.569]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:02.569 --> 02:55:03.650]  Yeah.
[02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:04.270]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:04.270 --> 02:55:05.631]  Thanks.
[02:55:05.631 --> 02:55:11.976]  I'm going to kind of rush through because I don't want to start coughing, and this is important.
[02:55:11.976 --> 02:55:13.818]  I've got about three ideas.
[02:55:13.818 --> 02:55:16.320]  They're all kind of nebulous together there.
[02:55:17.609 --> 02:55:22.771]  For stopping this invasion before they ever get on our ground.
[02:55:22.771 --> 02:55:38.475]  They involved, initially, LRAD, the audio crowd dispersal weapons, that are non-lethal, at our border.
[02:55:38.475 --> 02:55:46.918]  And also to donate some down there at the Honduras-Mexico border, where they can
[02:55:47.782 --> 02:55:54.146]  Put those things on and run them back away from the, uh, knockin' their gates down.
[02:55:54.146 --> 02:56:06.833]  But also, I'm thinking this is technologically viable, that it seems like these things could be mounted on at least helicopters, if not on AWACS planes.
[02:56:06.833 --> 02:56:10.936]  I don't know if they'd be fine-tunable enough to use on AWACS.
[02:56:10.936 --> 02:56:12.877]  But to stop those caravans,
[02:56:13.744 --> 02:56:17.888]  And just turn them around and herd them right straight back south.
[02:56:33.468 --> 02:56:36.914]  Well, also try to do something about the tender, but yeah.
[02:56:36.914 --> 02:56:40.941]  Sure, yeah, fire breaks and cut out the undergrowth, exactly.
[02:56:40.941 --> 02:56:46.210]  So that's what you do, but if you could magically, you're talking about a real solution, I'm saying hypothetically, you'd stop the lightning strike, okay?
[02:56:47.313 --> 02:56:48.413]  If we cut the U.N.
[02:56:48.413 --> 02:56:52.034]  funding that goes to USAID, that goes to U.N.
[02:56:52.034 --> 02:56:56.355]  funding, and then goes to Soros and the other foundations, it's a heads-off thing.
[02:56:56.355 --> 02:57:04.738]  Instead of having our military and everything get used up battling this and having to face kids, it's criminals and the Democratic Party and others organizing this with the U.N.
[02:57:04.738 --> 02:57:06.638]  on record, and then doing this.
[02:57:06.638 --> 02:57:11.960]  So what you do is, you go after the source of it.
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:13.480]  And I'm advising the President
[02:57:14.966 --> 02:57:20.768]  To use covert operations and covert action against the leadership of this.
[02:57:20.768 --> 02:57:29.110]  The courts are controlled and the globe will keep playing these games and it's time for the president to use covert action against Soros and against Hillary and all of them.
[02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:31.830]  I want covert action.
[02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:40.573]  Anything else is dereliction of duty and I'm telling the patriots and the CIA and the Pentagon and everyone else, I want covert action and I want it now!
[02:57:40.573 --> 02:57:41.733]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:57:45.396 --> 02:57:47.737]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:47.737 --> 02:57:49.897]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:57:49.897 --> 02:57:53.838]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:57:53.838 --> 02:58:05.321]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:58:05.321 --> 02:58:14.424]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:58:14.924 --> 02:58:20.710]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:26.136]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:58:26.136 --> 02:58:28.418]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:58:28.418 --> 02:58:30.440]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:58:31.681 --> 02:58:34.704]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:58:34.704 --> 02:58:36.727]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:58:36.727 --> 02:58:40.051]  We sold it at 50% off until it sold out.
[02:58:40.051 --> 02:58:42.574]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[02:58:42.574 --> 02:58:44.837]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[02:58:46.383 --> 02:58:50.625]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.625 --> 02:58:54.106]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.106 --> 02:58:55.867]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:55.867 --> 02:58:59.269]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.269 --> 02:59:05.932]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:05.932 --> 02:59:10.994]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:59:11.334 --> 02:59:17.461]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.461 --> 02:59:20.444]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.444 --> 02:59:21.526]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.526 --> 02:59:25.370]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.370 --> 02:59:26.051]  I want to push.
[02:59:26.331 --> 02:59:27.371]  All the way.
[02:59:27.371 --> 02:59:28.652]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.652 --> 02:59:31.373]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.373 --> 02:59:34.314]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.314 --> 02:59:35.635]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.635 --> 02:59:37.956]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:37.956 --> 02:59:38.916]  I physically will.
[02:59:38.916 --> 02:59:48.760]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullrestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:51.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.147 --> 03:00:09.831]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[03:00:09.831 --> 03:00:15.494]  A little secret.
[03:00:15.494 --> 03:00:19.136]  No, make no mistake, we've got people inside Soros' organization.
[03:00:19.136 --> 03:00:25.119]  We've got people inside all the Democratic Party operations.
[03:00:25.119 --> 03:00:27.620]  But you've also got to know they've got people in our organizations.
[03:00:28.635 --> 03:00:32.058]  You also gotta know, these people are mad dogs when it comes to power.
[03:00:32.058 --> 03:00:38.422]  So, folks who don't know what covert action is, that means taking the gloves off.
[03:00:38.422 --> 03:00:40.864]  These people have already taken the gloves off against this country.
[03:00:40.864 --> 03:00:42.485]  They're out of control.
[03:00:42.485 --> 03:00:46.568]  And I don't want to put myself in the position of calling for things like that.
[03:00:46.568 --> 03:00:55.134]  And however the President and others see fit to take care of it, I'm just signaling that this is too extreme, what's going on.
[03:00:55.134 --> 03:00:57.196]  As the President said, we'll shoot your ass.
[03:00:57.836 --> 03:00:59.998]  If you start attacking police and military.
[03:00:59.998 --> 03:01:12.549]  You're attacking our country, you're even worse because you're taking kids with you, you're funded by international war criminals, and we just can't sit here and be candy asses anymore, and then let them stage an event and we all apologize for it.
[03:01:12.549 --> 03:01:14.991]  You're the authors of this!
[03:01:14.991 --> 03:01:23.679]  And for those little children down there, the professors and the operatives and the leftist intelligence operatives,
[03:01:26.058 --> 03:01:29.940]  Who aren't real intelligence operatives.
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:37.683]  The Democrats ran more than 30 congressional candidates to the news today that were CIA.
[03:01:37.683 --> 03:01:41.004]  And not military CIA, not real CIA.
[03:01:41.004 --> 03:01:45.106]  The type of CIA that, you know, buys off your university for the chi-coms.
[03:01:45.106 --> 03:01:47.126]  We mean traitors.
[03:01:47.126 --> 03:01:52.649]  And they're so pissed Veritas has infiltrated them.
[03:01:52.649 --> 03:01:53.269]  And Veritas
[03:01:54.773 --> 03:01:58.676]  Isn't candy ass white shoe boy leftists that have a heart on for America.
[03:01:58.676 --> 03:02:05.762]  They're real people trained in tactics and ready to go in.
[03:02:05.762 --> 03:02:08.404]  And they are mopping the floor with you.
[03:02:08.404 --> 03:02:13.047]  Just like every time I've tried to infiltrate something, it's just victory.
[03:02:13.047 --> 03:02:16.030]  Because good people are smarter and stronger than evil.
[03:02:16.030 --> 03:02:17.611]  We get on the field, it's game over.
[03:02:20.888 --> 03:02:29.391]  And, you know, you guys think the left only has former intelligence operatives and people that are training folks to take on the globalists?
[03:02:29.391 --> 03:02:32.572]  We have the real people that have actually done it.
[03:02:32.572 --> 03:02:39.975]  We don't have the traitors that sit behind desks at Harvard and Yale and at the Ford Foundation who have a real hatred of this country.
[03:02:39.975 --> 03:02:43.496]  We have the patriots.
[03:02:43.496 --> 03:02:49.539]  But I don't want people to think that folks that are in intelligence agencies are the answer.
[03:02:49.539 --> 03:02:50.139]  I'm organic.
[03:02:52.287 --> 03:02:54.028]  I didn't go to some defense school.
[03:02:54.028 --> 03:02:56.750]  I didn't sit there and get sent to some CIA school.
[03:02:56.750 --> 03:03:02.273]  I actually went to the school of reality and actually read the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books.
[03:03:02.273 --> 03:03:08.477]  And I actually went out and did the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of missions and the training in the real world by doing it.
[03:03:08.477 --> 03:03:10.918]  And that's why we're so dangerous.
[03:03:10.918 --> 03:03:14.400]  It's because we are on our own.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:21.845]  And because we're on our own, we built the paradigm of the new resistance and the model of crushing the globalists.
[03:03:23.254 --> 03:03:25.075]  That's how innovation works.
[03:03:25.075 --> 03:03:51.467]  It doesn't come out of some weird, twit, inbred, mentally ill woman whose mommy and daddy are mental patients who got donated a bunch of money and they're trust fund kids and they've got some existential thing because at the country club when they were kids, you know, some good looking wasp made them look bad and they're a little hunchback wasp and so now they hate wasps and they're reliving five years old when someone was rude to mommy.
[03:03:56.232 --> 03:03:57.933]  That's, I mean, let me tell you something.
[03:03:57.933 --> 03:04:09.162]  The average leftist CIA person is a mental patient, but they revel their little CIA card and that they can get into databases and look into what you're doing or where you're going.
[03:04:09.162 --> 03:04:18.289]  And they just feel so, this is a sick, evil ruling class of extreme racist.
[03:04:18.289 --> 03:04:25.515]  And I can tell you that they have such a backlog of material with the lawyers.
[03:04:26.601 --> 03:04:27.681]  That they don't even know what to release.
[03:04:27.681 --> 03:04:29.762]  We have everything.
[03:04:29.762 --> 03:04:31.102]  Everything.
[03:04:31.102 --> 03:04:34.463]  On the New York Times, on the Washington Post, on Hillary.
[03:04:34.463 --> 03:04:38.684]  Because all the thinkers that were conned and were... Here's the secret when I come back.
[03:04:38.684 --> 03:04:40.244]  When I come back.
[03:04:40.244 --> 03:04:40.964]  The secret.
[03:04:40.964 --> 03:04:42.704]  The big secret.
[03:04:42.704 --> 03:04:43.965]  What they fear.
[03:04:43.965 --> 03:04:45.745]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:45.745 --> 03:04:46.585]  They're undoing.
[03:04:46.585 --> 03:04:48.105]  They're doom.
[03:04:48.105 --> 03:04:50.306]  The day of doom is here!
[03:04:54.215 --> 03:05:03.503]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:03.503 --> 03:05:06.385]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:06.385 --> 03:05:12.430]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:13.090 --> 03:05:19.336]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:19.336 --> 03:05:25.642]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:25.642 --> 03:05:32.689]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:32.689 --> 03:05:32.869]  But!
[03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:46.734]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:46.734 --> 03:05:50.995]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:50.995 --> 03:05:53.676]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:05:55.814 --> 03:05:56.955]  Big Brother.
[03:05:56.955 --> 03:05:58.756]  Mainstream media.
[03:05:58.756 --> 03:06:00.657]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:00.657 --> 03:06:02.319]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:02.319 --> 03:06:04.000]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:08.823]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.823 --> 03:06:11.265]  Get your motor running.
[03:06:11.265 --> 03:06:13.767]  Head out on the highway.
[03:06:13.767 --> 03:06:16.509]  Looking for adventure.
[03:06:16.509 --> 03:06:19.891]  And whatever might come our way!
[03:06:19.891 --> 03:06:22.833]  Haha!
[03:06:22.833 --> 03:06:25.035]  Nothing's gonna make it happen.
[03:06:32.273 --> 03:06:38.620]  We're going right back to your calls.
[03:06:38.620 --> 03:06:41.322]  The big secret is this.
[03:06:41.322 --> 03:06:50.732]  There are a lot of people that serve the government, corporations, and systems that were half awake but didn't know what to do and weren't sure, and now they see the full evil of the Democrats.
[03:06:51.755 --> 03:07:00.360]  They may have a bunch of illegal aliens and drug addicts and criminals on their side, but real confident people are now deciding, I'm not part of this.
[03:07:00.360 --> 03:07:04.202]  And they're joining the ranks of Make America Great Again.
[03:07:04.202 --> 03:07:07.364]  And so that's why there's no put the genie back in the bottle.
[03:07:07.364 --> 03:07:09.385]  You can't suppress excellence.
[03:07:09.385 --> 03:07:10.425]  You can't do it.
[03:07:10.425 --> 03:07:16.129]  You can kill a few of its leaders who love life but are ready to take one for the team.
[03:07:16.129 --> 03:07:18.010]  Like I love life so much I'm willing to die.
[03:07:18.595 --> 03:07:25.380]  I'll never commit suicide, but that's why they can't stand it, because they know I literally have no fear of them.
[03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:27.922]  Because I have fear of them having victory.
[03:07:27.922 --> 03:07:29.143]  That's my fear.
[03:07:29.143 --> 03:07:33.927]  I have fear of these people that want to molest our children, literally running things.
[03:07:33.927 --> 03:07:39.110]  A bunch of devil worshipper perverts that got control of the media and now they want to run our lives?
[03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:42.433]  No!
[03:07:42.433 --> 03:07:43.334]  J.D.
[03:07:43.334 --> 03:07:45.515]  in the great state of Texas, thanks for holding your real trooper.
[03:07:45.515 --> 03:07:46.016]  God bless you.
[03:07:46.016 --> 03:07:46.276]  Go ahead.
[03:07:47.557 --> 03:07:49.899]  Hey, it's a pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[03:07:49.899 --> 03:07:56.984]  I'm going to get right to the point, dispense with the pleasantries, although I would like to tell you how long I've been listening and all of that.
[03:07:56.984 --> 03:08:12.415]  I'm going to say that for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[03:08:12.415 --> 03:08:16.478]  What I'm getting at is the globalist elite playbook.
[03:08:17.698 --> 03:08:22.800]  Have you ever read Fundamental Laws by the Rose Cross Order?
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:24.500]  The Rosicrucians?
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:24.961]  Yes.
[03:08:24.961 --> 03:08:26.441]  Yeah, I've read it.
[03:08:26.441 --> 03:08:28.262]  It's the 68th Convocation?
[03:08:28.262 --> 03:08:34.844]  I read some Rosicrucian books about 20 years ago, but yeah, I know about it.
[03:08:34.844 --> 03:08:39.886]  Okay, yeah, so just to refresh a little bit for everyone else to know, what's
[03:08:41.104 --> 03:08:53.856]  One of the things in their books, they think that they have the real collegiate Bible and that the commoners have just what everyone else sees out there as the irregular whatever Bibles are available.
[03:08:53.856 --> 03:09:01.783]  They really believe that in their collegiate Bible that they're following something that's kind of good.
[03:09:01.783 --> 03:09:03.264]  It's kind of like rat poison.
[03:09:03.264 --> 03:09:07.508]  It's mostly good food, but there's 10% there that just is warped.
[03:09:08.556 --> 03:09:18.318]  And really, you know, it explains the great seal that they devised that's on our money, and it explains, like, the triangle around the eye.
[03:09:18.318 --> 03:09:35.442]  Sure, it's a Gnostic Christian order, and then there's actually multiple Rosicrucian systems, many of which are very evil, but then there's also some that's come out of it, like the New America and the New Atlantis and things, so it gets very confusing.
[03:09:36.596 --> 03:09:38.597]  Exactly, yes.
[03:09:38.597 --> 03:09:47.059]  It's really esoteric and it's one of those things where you kind of have to back up a paragraph and read it over.
[03:09:47.059 --> 03:09:57.462]  But, you know, I just wanted to say, you know, been a big fan of all of you guys and all of the hard work and the background people that you just mentioned before.
[03:09:57.462 --> 03:09:58.102]  And lastly,
[03:09:59.069 --> 03:10:09.255]  I know that they're trying to use the Sandy Hook thing to discredit you and basically, you know, boil you down to a vitamin salesman, and that's exactly how they work.
[03:10:09.255 --> 03:10:24.603]  And I want all of your listeners to know, and they probably already do, that that is the only one thing that they're trying to drill home, and the rest of everything else that you've got going on is true authentic American
[03:10:26.220 --> 03:10:27.581]  Well sure, exactly.
[03:10:27.581 --> 03:10:36.070]  They look at a compendium of work, and then misrepresent what I've said about things, and then they make it bad that we fund ourselves, and it's all funded by Soros.
[03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:41.134]  They filed a new Sandy Hook lawsuit yesterday, and because they got mad that some of the suits have been thrown out.
[03:10:41.134 --> 03:10:42.856]  So that's why people supporting us is so critical.
[03:10:42.856 --> 03:10:43.557]  God bless you, J.D.
[03:10:43.557 --> 03:10:44.358]  I appreciate that call.
[03:10:46.038 --> 03:10:49.539]  Yeah, you get into all this esoteric stuff, and it's pretty complex.
[03:10:49.539 --> 03:10:55.181]  I just know I love God, and I believe in white children, black children, pretty little Hispanic children, everybody.
[03:10:55.181 --> 03:10:56.682]  I love everybody.
[03:10:56.682 --> 03:11:02.163]  I just want to have it, but I don't want people weaponized against me because I'm from Europe, and then I'm a bad person.
[03:11:02.163 --> 03:11:06.665]  So, we have to stand up for ourselves, no matter what color you are, where you came from.
[03:11:06.665 --> 03:11:10.446]  We have to see the bigger picture, and who's behind what.
[03:11:10.446 --> 03:11:15.208]  Okay, let's go ahead and... Etion.
[03:11:17.156 --> 03:11:18.617]  ET on in Texas.
[03:11:18.617 --> 03:11:19.117]  You're on the air.
[03:11:19.117 --> 03:11:20.018]  Go ahead.
[03:11:20.018 --> 03:11:20.618]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:20.618 --> 03:11:21.538]  How's it going?
[03:11:21.538 --> 03:11:22.299]  Greetings.
[03:11:22.299 --> 03:11:22.679]  Greetings.
[03:11:22.679 --> 03:11:23.019]  Welcome.
[03:11:23.019 --> 03:11:26.380]  America is for President Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:27.141]  Anything else?
[03:11:27.141 --> 03:11:37.725]  Any other person, Hispanic, who wants to consider themselves an American or anything other than a real Jesus Christ believer is a fake and is a terrorist.
[03:11:37.725 --> 03:11:38.926]  I come from California.
[03:11:38.926 --> 03:11:42.487]  I made my move back to Texas for this reason.
[03:11:42.487 --> 03:11:46.029]  I see the Rio Grande Valley falling because of their belief
[03:11:46.690 --> 03:11:48.831]  Well, that's awesome.
[03:11:48.831 --> 03:11:50.132]  Say it slower.
[03:11:50.132 --> 03:11:51.713]  What's the name of your YouTube channel?
[03:12:15.317 --> 03:12:16.958]  Um, calabazo first.
[03:12:16.958 --> 03:12:20.261]  C-A-L-A-B-A-S-O first.
[03:12:20.261 --> 03:12:21.822]  Sure, what does calabazo mean in Spanish?
[03:12:21.822 --> 03:12:23.223]  I forget.
[03:12:23.223 --> 03:12:27.546]  Um, it's supposed to be like a squash, pumpkin.
[03:12:27.546 --> 03:12:30.708]  Um, I kind of made it into my own, just for that purpose.
[03:12:31.923 --> 03:12:32.583]  Well, that's good.
[03:12:32.583 --> 03:12:33.204]  What do you think?
[03:12:33.204 --> 03:12:34.285]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[03:12:34.285 --> 03:12:36.966]  They organized a bunch of communists in South America.
[03:12:36.966 --> 03:12:38.187]  March them up.
[03:12:38.187 --> 03:12:39.929]  It's openly run by the UN, the Democrats.
[03:12:39.929 --> 03:12:48.094]  I mean, this is insanely obvious that our whole media tries to cover it up, even though a year ago Soros said he was doing it.
[03:12:48.094 --> 03:12:48.935]  Okay, yeah.
[03:12:48.935 --> 03:12:52.717]  So, we know we've been infiltrated.
[03:12:52.717 --> 03:12:57.280]  We're being torn down by our own people.
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:59.422]  What is important is
[03:13:00.086 --> 03:13:07.754]  Many people will not understand, especially the Hispanic people, will not understand who George Soros is.
[03:13:07.754 --> 03:13:13.561]  Everything that he's done has worked perfectly towards his plan, except in our eyes, the ones that are open.
[03:13:13.561 --> 03:13:15.443]  He is an anti-Christian demon.
[03:13:18.496 --> 03:13:19.697]  Correct, yes.
[03:13:19.697 --> 03:13:22.999]  And what we must do, we must continue pushing what we're doing.
[03:13:22.999 --> 03:13:24.499]  I thank you for your call, Alex.
[03:13:24.499 --> 03:13:26.300]  I appreciate all of your products.
[03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:28.462]  I just received it on Monday.
[03:13:28.462 --> 03:13:29.662]  Man, I see the results.
[03:13:29.662 --> 03:13:30.283]  It's beautiful.
[03:13:30.283 --> 03:13:31.083]  It's awesome.
[03:13:31.083 --> 03:13:36.166]  I've been a longtime listener and I hope to hear from you again and I will always keep in touch with y'all.
[03:13:36.166 --> 03:13:37.347]  God bless you, Etion.
[03:13:37.907 --> 03:13:39.188]  Yeah, I never plug Icarin.
[03:13:39.188 --> 03:13:42.770]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there and make it even stronger and better.
[03:13:42.770 --> 03:13:44.031]  What has the best rating statement.
[03:13:44.031 --> 03:13:47.533]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[03:13:47.533 --> 03:13:57.339]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician because these products aren't like... A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler because they're scared of real supplements.
[03:13:57.339 --> 03:14:03.622]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[03:14:03.622 --> 03:14:05.243]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[03:14:05.243 --> 03:14:06.104]  Look, I've got
[03:14:06.940 --> 03:14:07.901]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:14:07.901 --> 03:14:08.762]  What do you think about this?
[03:14:08.762 --> 03:14:10.163]  Alex Jones does Boss Hogg and Whiteface.
[03:14:36.388 --> 03:14:37.749]  Yeah, you're pretty funny.
[03:14:37.749 --> 03:14:39.369]  I can do a boss hug.
[03:14:39.369 --> 03:14:41.550]  You'll trigger the whole world.
[03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:44.391]  But seriously, my point is this.
[03:14:44.391 --> 03:14:54.836]  I'd like to talk about what I call Operation Suppository being activated right now with Caesar Sayoc, Michael Moore, and the Pope.
[03:14:54.836 --> 03:15:05.500]  When Caesar Sayoc came out, rolled out, and it all blew up, and no pun intended, and was revealed to be a total fraud, framing the right,
[03:15:06.494 --> 03:15:16.845]  Um, a few days later, Michael Moore magically comes up with footage of this guy at a rally, and that's been all over news I haven't heard about.
[03:15:16.845 --> 03:15:18.307]  Oh yeah, no, I should have mentioned it here.
[03:15:18.307 --> 03:15:21.790]  Yeah, no, it's just funny that Michael Moore magically had that footage.
[03:15:21.790 --> 03:15:27.897]  He has this footage, and then he's visiting the Pope, of all people.
[03:15:28.989 --> 03:15:41.382]  And Steve Pchenik on The War Room brought out an interesting point saying Cesar Sayoc, his name means emperor, first name, and last name, master of chaos.
[03:15:41.382 --> 03:15:41.922]  No, it's true.
[03:15:41.922 --> 03:15:43.143]  We should get Pchenik back on.
[03:15:43.143 --> 03:15:43.644]  Great point.
[03:15:43.644 --> 03:15:50.671]  Well, we know the Pope is a pedophile master, and Michael Moore looks like the biggest, fattest, ugliest pedophile I ever saw.
[03:15:50.671 --> 03:15:51.672]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[03:15:53.726 --> 03:15:54.946]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.946 --> 03:16:00.328]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.328 --> 03:16:03.230]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.230 --> 03:16:06.811]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[03:17:24.438 --> 03:17:28.380]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.380 --> 03:17:29.901]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.901 --> 03:17:32.863]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.863 --> 03:17:38.426]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.426 --> 03:17:39.627]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.627 --> 03:17:42.568]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:19:04.084 --> 03:19:08.786]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.786 --> 03:19:11.868]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.348 --> 03:19:14.030]  I still have that energy.

[03:20:08.257 --> 03:20:16.499]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.499 --> 03:20:19.300]  What a bummer, I just missed a Ted Nugent call an hour ago.
[03:20:19.300 --> 03:20:20.820]  I was looking at my phone.
[03:20:20.820 --> 03:20:23.321]  I don't know if I looked at how I missed the President's call, Ted Nugent's call.
[03:20:23.321 --> 03:20:26.901]  It just gets worse and worse from here.
[03:20:26.901 --> 03:20:28.202]  It's fun to be in the fight though, isn't it?
[03:20:28.202 --> 03:20:31.903]  I'm not name-dropping, but I am name-dropping.
[03:20:31.903 --> 03:20:34.283]  Oh, there he is again.
[03:20:34.283 --> 03:20:35.704]  Hey, Daria, come get him.
[03:20:35.704 --> 03:20:37.104]  He's asking for the right hotline number.
[03:20:38.524 --> 03:20:40.245]  You were hearing it, but I didn't hear what you said.
[03:20:40.245 --> 03:20:41.226]  We've got like three hotlines.
[03:20:41.226 --> 03:20:43.467]  Just come take it.
[03:20:43.467 --> 03:20:44.948]  Or Gilbert's about to get preempted.
[03:20:44.948 --> 03:20:47.449]  Just come on in here and get it.
[03:20:47.449 --> 03:20:50.931]  Because you're telling me those mics you use are distorted.
[03:20:50.931 --> 03:20:52.191]  I can't hear a word.
[03:20:52.191 --> 03:20:52.471]  There you go.
[03:20:52.471 --> 03:20:54.953]  Go ahead and text him the number.
[03:20:54.953 --> 03:20:56.233]  Or Gilbert's getting preempted.
[03:20:56.233 --> 03:20:56.713]  That's okay.
[03:20:56.713 --> 03:20:57.534]  You can join us tomorrow.
[03:20:57.534 --> 03:20:58.394]  Good old Joel Gilbert.

[03:21:00.776 --> 03:21:04.337]  Who's up next here?
[03:21:04.337 --> 03:21:07.079]  Who's been holding the longest now here?
[03:21:07.079 --> 03:21:07.339]  Rich?
[03:21:10.017 --> 03:21:15.381]  Brad, Stephanie.
[03:21:15.381 --> 03:21:16.421]  Andrew has been holding on.
[03:21:16.421 --> 03:21:17.642]  It's Andrew in Florida.
[03:21:17.642 --> 03:21:18.623]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:21:18.623 --> 03:21:20.204]  Go ahead.
[03:21:20.204 --> 03:21:23.186]  Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[03:21:23.186 --> 03:21:27.428]  And all I can say is that I feel like it's deja vu all over again from 2016.
[03:21:27.428 --> 03:21:38.836]  You know, you feel the confidence if you're looking at the early voting numbers that are happening in Florida, Texas, Georgia, the states that they keep saying are all going to go blue.
[03:21:39.451 --> 03:21:41.792]  You know, I'm starting to feel deja vu.
[03:21:41.792 --> 03:21:45.213]  This is exactly what happened last time, last cycle.
[03:21:45.213 --> 03:21:46.614]  All the polls were cooked.
[03:21:46.614 --> 03:22:00.679]  If you look at the samples for the polls now, that CNN, USA Today, everybody, has been... I'm hearing... I believe there's been one poll that has Ron DeSantis up in Florida.
[03:22:00.679 --> 03:22:01.460]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:22:01.460 --> 03:22:02.040]  Here's the problem.
[03:22:03.154 --> 03:22:04.375]  When we zigged, they zagged.
[03:22:04.375 --> 03:22:06.757]  They put out totally fake polls for Hillary.
[03:22:06.757 --> 03:22:08.238]  They know she was behind from the beginning.
[03:22:08.238 --> 03:22:13.261]  That made them really scared, so they overcompensated, tried to steal a bunch of states.
[03:22:13.261 --> 03:22:21.627]  Now, they still keep oversampling, but they're not doing it as much, and they're engaged in massive fraud and massive spending.
[03:22:21.627 --> 03:22:27.692]  So I agree, gut level, looking at all the tea leaves, I think we barely keep the House, even gain a seat or two in the Senate.
[03:22:28.578 --> 03:22:36.760]  The problem is that they are in just flame-throwing lies right now, and just doing so many things.
[03:22:36.760 --> 03:22:41.621]  So, can our red wave overtake their blue seawall?
[03:22:41.621 --> 03:22:43.082]  Thank you for calling.
[03:22:43.082 --> 03:22:55.345]  Well, joining us, ladies and gentlemen, with just three and a half days left to the big decision, what they're calling the most important election in modern history, is the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, for this segment and the next.
[03:22:55.865 --> 03:22:57.369]  Uncle Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:22:57.369 --> 03:23:03.766]  I know you've been campaigning hard up there in Michigan, and I just wanted to get your take on what your gut level is thinking right now.
[03:23:04.605 --> 03:23:14.153]  Well, more important than my take, Alex, is truth, logic, and common sense, and the pulse of, you know, honest, conscientious, working hard, playing hard America.
[03:23:14.153 --> 03:23:22.139]  We talk about this every time, but these are just outrageous, bizarro world times that we're dealing with right now.
[03:23:22.139 --> 03:23:33.248]  So let me share with you, from the sacred swamps of Michigan, and by the way, Alex, I hope you know, and I know you do, that I don't get out of my tree stand on November 2nd for just anybody.
[03:23:33.248 --> 03:23:33.648]  I know that.
[03:23:34.168 --> 03:23:51.116]  This is so important, and you're right, I am busting my ass to get truth, logic, and common sense back into my beloved birth state of Michigan, the epicenter of productivity and work ethic and family pride and earning your own way and helping your neighbors.
[03:23:51.116 --> 03:23:57.319]  I mean, when I was born in 1948, Michigan was the example the whole world looked at.
[03:23:57.319 --> 03:24:00.180]  The only other powerhouse close to it was Texas.
[03:24:00.180 --> 03:24:01.321]  I mean, you guys were everything.
[03:24:02.031 --> 03:24:21.601]  Sure, and now that I'm a Texan, I'm still up here in Michigan because can you imagine a worse curse that you would hang your head in shame than when the media during the 2016 election constantly referred to my state, my original home and birth state of Michigan, as a reliably blue state?
[03:24:22.822 --> 03:24:23.823]  We're good to go.
[03:24:41.182 --> 03:24:55.790]  And the pulse I get around the campfire from great entrepreneurial families, just dedicated, generous, loving families that donate to these children's charities and these military charities that we donate these hunts for auctions.
[03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:58.952]  And Alex, you're not alone!
[03:24:59.925 --> 03:25:01.966]  I'm not alone.
[03:25:01.966 --> 03:25:04.447]  You're damn right we're radical.
[03:25:04.447 --> 03:25:20.595]  Because the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, the Declaration of Independence, rugged individualism is radical in a world of sheep where tyrants and dictators and despots used to rule the day till we met the punks at Concord Bridge and cut them in half.
[03:25:21.235 --> 03:25:27.799]  That radical independent spirit is alive and well, which is why we've got Donald Trump in the White House.
[03:25:27.799 --> 03:25:32.342]  And I know that your listening audience is already cocked, locked, and ready to rock that glock, doc.
[03:25:32.342 --> 03:25:37.526]  We're tuned in to the Constitution that only the Republicans represent.
[03:25:37.526 --> 03:25:39.227]  Everybody knows that.
[03:25:39.227 --> 03:25:50.514]  But the pain and anger and heartbreak around the Neutron campfire every day from men and women and families, young kids, special needs kids, Alex.
[03:25:51.258 --> 03:25:58.702]  They can't believe that there's a political party in America that doesn't believe in America first!
[03:25:58.702 --> 03:26:00.342]  Let me stop you.
[03:26:00.342 --> 03:26:02.303]  Let me stop you, Ted.
[03:26:02.303 --> 03:26:03.964]  You're on fire.
[03:26:03.964 --> 03:26:13.249]  We have Democratic leaders like Michael Moore and like Cuomo of New York saying America was never great and it's not going to be great.
[03:26:13.249 --> 03:26:14.729]  And they really aren't Americans.
[03:26:14.729 --> 03:26:18.531]  They hate this country like baby ducks that imprinted on evil.
[03:26:18.531 --> 03:26:19.592]  What's wrong with them?
[03:26:20.399 --> 03:26:28.571]  Well, I got a bunch of theories, but I've dealt with them, and I gotta tell you, it's really, it's so strange, because I'm a logic guy.
[03:26:28.571 --> 03:26:30.033]  You know, 1 and 1 equals 2.
[03:26:30.033 --> 03:26:32.596]  I don't care how uncomfortable you are with the number 2.
[03:26:32.596 --> 03:26:34.619]  1 and 1 equals 2.
[03:26:34.619 --> 03:26:35.580]  Venice is food.
[03:26:36.001 --> 03:26:42.105]  I have the right to keep and bear arms, and a nation without secure borders isn't a nation anymore.
[03:26:42.105 --> 03:26:48.928]  And you don't provide sanctuary to criminals, you provide sanctuary for your citizens.
[03:26:48.928 --> 03:26:55.012]  What we're doing at the border right now, and I'm talking to some Marines and some Air Force and some Coast Guard and some U.S.
[03:26:55.012 --> 03:26:56.693]  Army Rangers and the U.S.
[03:26:56.693 --> 03:27:05.178]  Navy, they're at my camp right now, Alex, and they are, they can't, in their heart, they can't believe that anyone
[03:27:05.838 --> 03:27:12.321]  Not in America would be against the President providing security at our borders.
[03:27:12.321 --> 03:27:19.485]  This is Planet of the Apes, Cuckoo's Nest, Clockwork Dayglo Orange, Twilight Zone, Zombieland USA.
[03:27:19.485 --> 03:27:22.426]  So Alex, thank you for raising hell.
[03:27:22.426 --> 03:27:25.168]  Thank you for spotlighting cockroaches in Texas.
[03:27:25.168 --> 03:27:29.430]  I pray to God we haven't been infiltrated in Texas by a bunch
[03:27:29.790 --> 03:27:30.291]  We're good.
[03:27:47.247 --> 03:27:48.547]  We're good to go.
[03:28:06.574 --> 03:28:10.738]  America is standing strong because we have a Calvary... Ted, stay there.
[03:28:10.738 --> 03:28:13.220]  I know you've been in... You've been kicking ass up in Michigan.
[03:28:13.220 --> 03:28:13.800]  We gotta go to break.
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:15.322]  I think I gotta go in like five minutes.
[03:28:15.322 --> 03:28:16.943]  We're gonna come back and have you finish up on it.
[03:28:16.943 --> 03:28:17.684]  I'm sure you heard it.
[03:28:17.684 --> 03:28:18.544]  You may not.
[03:28:18.544 --> 03:28:20.786]  Beto O'Rourke got caught working for Soros.
[03:28:20.786 --> 03:28:21.567]  It's mainstream news.
[03:28:21.567 --> 03:28:22.308]  Project Veritas.
[03:28:22.788 --> 03:28:25.449]  With MasterCard, he's funding the whole thing.
[03:28:25.449 --> 03:28:31.511]  They've already got caravans hitting, and they're giving them $1,000 credit cards, including smuggled kids.
[03:28:31.511 --> 03:28:32.351]  They got the video.
[03:28:32.351 --> 03:28:37.712]  So we're going to go to break for three minutes, come back and get your take on Beto O'Rourke should be arrested.
[03:28:37.712 --> 03:28:39.793]  This guy, and he says his mom's a Republican.
[03:28:39.793 --> 03:28:41.934]  Turns out she's a lifelong Democrat.
[03:28:41.934 --> 03:28:44.134]  He wants to ban all semi-autos.
[03:28:44.134 --> 03:28:47.235]  Ted Nugent, the Titan of America.
[03:28:47.235 --> 03:28:49.476]  Straight ahead, only three and a half days out.
[03:28:49.476 --> 03:28:50.036]  Stay with us.
[03:28:53.268 --> 03:28:56.850]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.850 --> 03:29:00.431]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.

[03:31:53.715 --> 03:32:03.018]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:03.018 --> 03:32:05.879]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.879 --> 03:32:11.901]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.601 --> 03:32:18.847]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.847 --> 03:32:25.153]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.153 --> 03:32:32.080]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.221 --> 03:32:46.248]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:46.248 --> 03:32:50.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:50.510 --> 03:32:57.173]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:32:57.173 --> 03:33:00.455]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.988 --> 03:33:22.437]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.733 --> 03:33:29.936]  Let me tell you, we just had a four-minute break, and if he could repeat what he said on air, it's unbelievable.
[03:33:29.936 --> 03:33:32.397]  Ted Nugent is on fire.
[03:33:32.397 --> 03:33:33.978]  The force is with him.
[03:33:33.978 --> 03:33:37.980]  I was getting into Beto and the big Veritas thing that they're running with the UN.
[03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:39.961]  Soros, it's all confirmed, they're funding it.
[03:33:39.961 --> 03:33:41.222]  It's all over drudge.
[03:33:41.222 --> 03:33:43.783]  It's breaking.
[03:33:43.783 --> 03:33:48.406]  He was just talking about how amazing it is spiritually, at a gut level, to be fighting this tyranny.
[03:33:48.406 --> 03:33:53.969]  So, Uncle Ted, if you could just repeat what you said during the break, that'd be amazing.
[03:33:54.620 --> 03:34:12.684]  Well you know it's simple to do because I live the American dream with all my heart and soul and I'm 70 years having the time of my life so I appreciate freedom because I do so much work with the military and generous Americans who know that freedom is not free and I'm having the greatest hunting season of my life
[03:34:13.204 --> 03:34:18.707]  And every day we hear a campfire with the heroes of the military and their families and children's charities.
[03:34:18.707 --> 03:34:22.650]  And the love and the positive spirit is over the top.
[03:34:22.650 --> 03:34:34.297]  And I think that God loves me a little bit more the more I fight for freedom and fight for His individual rights that He's provided us and how the founding fathers wrote them down.
[03:34:34.297 --> 03:34:39.740]  I'm killing some great bucks with some beautiful mystical flights of the arrow and my point being
[03:34:40.797 --> 03:34:42.399]  That this is a culture war.
[03:34:42.399 --> 03:34:43.981]  You've talked about it forever.
[03:34:43.981 --> 03:34:45.602]  You've raised hell forever.
[03:34:45.602 --> 03:34:53.031]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, the people listening, I know they clenched their fist and they shouted out loud, glory, glory, hallelujah.
[03:34:53.031 --> 03:34:55.233]  We the people experiment in a self-government.
[03:34:55.233 --> 03:34:59.578]  But there are people listening to us right now who don't vote.
[03:35:00.936 --> 03:35:05.039]  And Nancy Pelosi would like to thank you for not voting.
[03:35:05.039 --> 03:35:15.667]  Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Charlie Schumer and Eric Holder and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would like to thank all good Americans who don't vote.
[03:35:15.667 --> 03:35:20.471]  Because when you don't vote Constitution and logic and truth and common sense,
[03:35:20.991 --> 03:35:25.073]  You literally are voting for the Democrats who hate America.
[03:35:25.073 --> 03:35:30.396]  In the past, Alex, when we said how the Democrats hate America, people would say, oh, that's over the top.
[03:35:30.396 --> 03:35:33.417]  That rhetorical outrage is unacceptable.
[03:35:33.417 --> 03:35:41.641]  Now people are waking up that when you are angry at a president who says America first, you hate America.
[03:35:41.641 --> 03:35:43.022]  When you listen to the president
[03:35:43.829 --> 03:35:47.791]  Proclaim his pride for being a nationalist, because I'm a nationalist.
[03:35:47.791 --> 03:35:49.051]  You're a nationalist.
[03:35:49.051 --> 03:35:50.132]  We are all nationalists.
[03:35:50.132 --> 03:35:51.632]  We believe in America.
[03:35:51.632 --> 03:35:55.794]  And then the media inserts the word white.
[03:35:55.794 --> 03:35:56.815]  Alex!
[03:35:56.815 --> 03:35:58.355]  The president never said that.
[03:35:58.355 --> 03:36:00.116]  He said, I'm a nationalist.
[03:36:00.116 --> 03:36:07.760]  I love America, which means every ethnicity, every gender, every religion, every creed, every color, every walk of life.
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:13.082]  And the media goes berserk with their dishonesty to actually turn a
[03:36:18.134 --> 03:36:20.937]  It's Don Lemon and all those punks.
[03:36:20.937 --> 03:36:21.978]  Racists!
[03:36:21.978 --> 03:36:28.226]  So this is the time to be radical because a culture war is radical and freedom is worth it.
[03:36:28.226 --> 03:36:30.168]  Now is the time to vote.
[03:36:30.168 --> 03:36:33.432]  And if you've ever been suspicious or confused,
[03:36:34.284 --> 03:36:42.413]  If you do not vote Republican, you might as well wipe your ass with the Constitution because that's what the Democrats believe in.
[03:36:42.413 --> 03:36:45.177]  They don't believe in sanctuary for Americans.
[03:36:45.177 --> 03:36:48.981]  They believe in sanctuary for invaders of America.
[03:36:49.341 --> 03:36:56.027]  So I could go on, but I know I'm repeating the common sense, the truth, and the logic that you let loose every day.
[03:36:56.027 --> 03:37:08.598]  And again, we the people who are in the asset column, who make sacrifices and take risks and work our asses off to be a benefit to our family and our neighborhood, our country, the earth, the environment, our fellow man all over the world.
[03:37:08.598 --> 03:37:12.282]  When you're in the asset column, you're an asset for everybody.
[03:37:12.282 --> 03:37:15.845]  Beto O'Rourke wants you to be in the liability column.
[03:37:15.885 --> 03:37:16.945]  On fire, Ted Nugent.
[03:37:16.945 --> 03:37:18.566]  Ted, the few minutes we have left.
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:51.102]  The Democrats have come out and said, as you said, you can't even say we're a country that exists.
[03:37:51.102 --> 03:37:53.604]  You can't have mothers and fathers.
[03:37:53.604 --> 03:37:54.824]  Everything we do is bad.
[03:37:54.824 --> 03:37:55.805]  America was never great.
[03:37:55.805 --> 03:37:57.605]  It'll never be great.
[03:37:57.605 --> 03:37:59.386]  As I mentioned earlier, that's the governor of New York.
[03:37:59.386 --> 03:38:02.588]  These people are crazy.
[03:38:02.588 --> 03:38:07.210]  And I just can't believe they've got so many people to buy into their weirdness that it's neck and neck.
[03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:10.614]  And they're literally saying the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[03:38:10.614 --> 03:38:14.058]  Judge people about what they do and what they say and what they stand for.
[03:38:14.058 --> 03:38:17.483]  Like you listen to music, whether it's blacks playing it or whites playing it.
[03:38:17.483 --> 03:38:18.204]  We love it.
[03:38:18.204 --> 03:38:21.028]  If food's good, I don't care who owns the restaurant, I'm going there.
[03:38:21.028 --> 03:38:24.473]  And they turn around when we're the ones promoting classic Americana and they invoke...
[03:38:25.819 --> 03:38:37.362]  Race war, and they say kill our president all over the news, and they say we're the ones, and then they say Trump, who's pro-Israel, it's his fault some idiot went, some demon went and killed people.
[03:38:37.362 --> 03:38:39.123]  It just doesn't hold water.
[03:38:39.123 --> 03:38:41.304]  So let me ask you this.
[03:38:41.304 --> 03:38:47.425]  Gut level, I think if everybody goes and votes, we're still fighting a tsunami of fraudulent votes, but I still think we hold the House and Senate.
[03:38:47.425 --> 03:38:48.846]  What does the left do then?
[03:38:48.846 --> 03:38:52.787]  Because they are in war mode, and at a certain point,
[03:38:53.985 --> 03:38:55.446]  How do we respond to that?
[03:38:55.446 --> 03:39:08.436]  How does the President respond with tens of thousands of people marching up here, funded by the UN, to attack police and military, trying to run over our border, and leftist groups shooing the President, saying, you can't stop this.
[03:39:08.436 --> 03:39:10.218]  I mean, this is existential.
[03:39:10.218 --> 03:39:11.839]  They're making their move on the Republic.
[03:39:12.881 --> 03:39:16.025]  Well, I'll make it perfectly clear, and I know I echo what you believe in.
[03:39:16.025 --> 03:39:17.406]  I know what you're made out of, Alex.
[03:39:17.406 --> 03:39:19.468]  I know what your listeners are made out of.
[03:39:19.468 --> 03:39:23.973]  They're good, decent, law-abiding, conscientious, generous Americans.
[03:39:23.973 --> 03:39:28.819]  That's everybody in my band, my family, my brothers, my sisters, my crew, everybody around my campfire.
[03:39:29.139 --> 03:39:35.128]  All my fellow National Rifle Association members, we have a group called HunterNation.org.
[03:39:35.128 --> 03:39:43.619]  Everybody go to HunterNation.org and help us fight to get our private property and we the people's wildlife back in the control of science.
[03:39:43.619 --> 03:39:44.921]  HunterNation.org.
[03:39:44.921 --> 03:39:45.903]  But that's an example.
[03:39:46.583 --> 03:39:48.625]  We do not believe in violence.
[03:39:48.625 --> 03:39:50.206]  We denounce violence.
[03:39:50.206 --> 03:39:55.770]  I would protect Don Lemon from violence, even though he's a soulless punk.
[03:39:55.770 --> 03:39:56.691]  He's a liar.
[03:39:56.691 --> 03:39:57.952]  He's a racist.
[03:39:57.952 --> 03:40:03.055]  But I would protect him from violence, and I denounce all violence.
[03:40:03.055 --> 03:40:03.696]  However,
[03:40:04.463 --> 03:40:08.787]  We also believe in the right to self-defense.
[03:40:08.787 --> 03:40:29.344]  And I just did a special event with the Law Enforcement Heroes of America, so God bless law enforcement, God bless the military and the first responders, and we the people who are doing our moral, intellectual, and spiritual obligation as citizens of America to research the candidates, hold them to a constitutional fire,
[03:40:30.160 --> 03:40:33.703]  And vote to make America great.
[03:40:33.703 --> 03:40:38.988]  Constitutional, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, be the best that you can be.
[03:40:38.988 --> 03:40:44.833]  It's alive and well, but if we don't vote, the Democrats have lost their soul.
[03:40:44.833 --> 03:40:45.554]  They're just
[03:40:46.294 --> 03:40:47.475]  They have no bottom, Ted.
[03:40:47.475 --> 03:40:47.995]  They have no bottom.
[03:40:47.995 --> 03:40:49.315]  And I'm going to ask you this question next.
[03:40:49.315 --> 03:41:00.580]  We don't want violence with the 80 plus percent military age men, with women using kids as shields, like Islamic terrorists, you know, with kids as suicide bombers.
[03:41:00.580 --> 03:41:04.881]  But Trump said they almost killed a couple of Mexican police and military.
[03:41:04.881 --> 03:41:05.902]  A few were in critical condition.
[03:41:05.902 --> 03:41:07.862]  They beat them over the head with clubs, firebombs.
[03:41:09.483 --> 03:41:14.264]  And Trump said, you throw big rocks at people, that's a deadly weapon, we're going to shoot back.
[03:41:14.264 --> 03:41:16.425]  That's not a violent call.
[03:41:16.425 --> 03:41:19.285]  If you're going to let them know they can come attack, they're going to do it.
[03:41:19.285 --> 03:41:25.827]  Tens of thousands of armed people using kids as shields coming up, who are about to attack our border and our country.
[03:41:25.827 --> 03:41:28.307]  I mean, what is Trump supposed to do?
[03:41:28.307 --> 03:41:29.968]  I think that's a shot across the bow.
[03:41:29.968 --> 03:41:35.029]  He's being honest, saying, what do we do, just sit there and let them throw bricks at the military and police?
[03:41:35.759 --> 03:41:36.980]  Well, I'll leave you with this, Alex.
[03:41:36.980 --> 03:41:46.505]  Thanks for letting me bring my voice and the voice of everybody I know, just great, great Americans across this country on their radio program and to share it on the airwaves of America.
[03:41:46.505 --> 03:41:47.586]  But let me leave you with this.
[03:41:47.586 --> 03:41:50.147]  I support President Trump's every move.
[03:41:50.147 --> 03:41:53.509]  I support President Trump in everything he does and says.
[03:41:53.509 --> 03:41:59.293]  We don't want someone presidential because the fake presidential guys got us into this mess.
[03:41:59.293 --> 03:42:00.733]  We want a hellraiser.
[03:42:00.733 --> 03:42:01.834]  We want a constitutional
[03:42:02.194 --> 03:42:04.375]  We want a we the people, earn your own way guy.
[03:42:04.375 --> 03:42:05.796]  That's what Donald Trump is.
[03:42:05.796 --> 03:42:06.896]  And I'll leave you with this.
[03:42:06.896 --> 03:42:21.683]  I'm on my way to my tree stand right now and I will kill more deer this year because the Hunters for the Hungry program has for 27 years donated 250 million hot meals of venison every year, Alex, to soup kitchens and homeless shelters.
[03:42:21.683 --> 03:42:26.145]  And I'll leave you with a couple of stanzas of the Democrats' new national anthem.
[03:42:26.145 --> 03:42:30.627]  My name is Ted Nugent and this is the Democrat National Anthem.
[03:42:39.609 --> 03:42:45.591]  Let me say bye to you Ted, I never heard you on fire.
[03:42:45.591 --> 03:42:49.151]  During the break he said he shoots the best he's ever shot with a bow, so that's what I wanted to say.
[03:42:49.151 --> 03:42:51.232]  We'll be back, straight ahead, stay with us.
[03:42:53.291 --> 03:43:00.773]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[03:46:57.228 --> 03:47:15.873]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.873 --> 03:47:21.875]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Joel Gilbert!
[03:47:21.875 --> 03:47:24.696]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:27.470 --> 03:47:29.231]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.231 --> 03:47:35.394]  Joel Gilbert coming to you for the rest of this hour from the People's Republic of California looking for a big win.
[03:47:35.394 --> 03:47:40.956]  I'm predicting a big win for the Republicans on Tuesday for the midterms.
[03:47:40.956 --> 03:47:42.857]  But watch out the Democrats.
[03:47:42.857 --> 03:47:44.518]  I just got this in the mail.
[03:47:44.518 --> 03:47:46.359]  Maxine Waters sample ballot.
[03:47:46.359 --> 03:47:48.179]  There's the sample ballot.
[03:47:48.179 --> 03:47:50.560]  And she actually shows people how to vote.
[03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:53.642]  She checks for people, the actual
[03:47:54.542 --> 03:47:56.162]  Put an X in every single box.
[03:47:56.162 --> 03:47:59.583]  This is how Democrats feel about the electorate.
[03:47:59.583 --> 03:48:00.783]  They have to be told what to do.
[03:48:00.783 --> 03:48:02.004]  They're like sheep.
[03:48:02.004 --> 03:48:05.824]  They tell them, put your X right here, telling them how to vote.
[03:48:05.824 --> 03:48:13.326]  This is the low IQ, as Donald Trump says, Maxine Waters considers her constituents to be low IQ.
[03:48:13.326 --> 03:48:15.867]  So she's actually filling out the ballot for them.
[03:48:18.357 --> 03:48:19.377]  Anyway, look for a big win.
[03:48:19.377 --> 03:48:23.678]  I think Trump has proven over two years that he's going to bring the economy around.
[03:48:23.678 --> 03:48:24.938]  He cares about America.
[03:48:24.938 --> 03:48:29.239]  He's established the emotional bond with his Republican base.
[03:48:29.239 --> 03:48:32.039]  And I'm looking for a huge win on Tuesday.
[03:48:32.039 --> 03:48:38.661]  But watch out for the Democrats not accepting the results of democracy, as they did not in 2012.
[03:48:38.661 --> 03:48:41.461]  They took to the streets to protest democracy.
[03:48:41.461 --> 03:48:42.461]  Look for more of the same.
[03:48:42.461 --> 03:48:45.862]  I want to bring on Larry Klayman to talk about this
[03:48:46.972 --> 03:48:50.394]  Result of this horrific attack in Pittsburgh.
[03:48:50.394 --> 03:48:52.396]  I'm originally from Pittsburgh.
[03:48:52.396 --> 03:48:57.159]  When I was six years old, I used to go to the Tree of Life Synagogue, actually, in Pittsburgh.
[03:48:57.159 --> 03:49:00.862]  I remember it quite well, even though I was young.
[03:49:00.862 --> 03:49:04.224]  And I was shocked that there was no security there.
[03:49:04.224 --> 03:49:05.745]  Gun control doesn't matter anymore.
[03:49:05.745 --> 03:49:09.147]  Don't forget, Larry, people can print guns on your printer.
[03:49:09.147 --> 03:49:11.629]  So you take away all the guns and people are going to print them.
[03:49:13.365 --> 03:49:24.353]  Larry, you wrote an article about the Jewish left, saying that the leftist Jews are a danger to other Jewish people and even to Israel.
[03:49:24.353 --> 03:49:37.903]  Now, people today think of prominent Jewish leftists like Chuck Schumer, Dan Feinstein, Adam Schiff, Bernie Sanders, and even more embarrassing, some of the media like Dana Milbank from Washington Post and Jeff Zucker.
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:56.675]  CNN, but they don't know or realize, just like there are a lot of black conservatives, people identify today, black people with supporting Democrats, there are a lot of black conservatives, a lot of conservative Jews, all the way back to Barry Goldwater, of course big donors like Sheldon Adelson.
[03:49:56.675 --> 03:50:03.020]  Tell us about your piece, why these leftist Jews are a danger to the people.
[03:50:03.874 --> 03:50:05.615]  Well, let me say this, Joel.
[03:50:05.615 --> 03:50:06.816]  Like you, I'm Jewish.
[03:50:06.816 --> 03:50:08.157]  I'm Messianic.
[03:50:08.157 --> 03:50:09.998]  But I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage.
[03:50:09.998 --> 03:50:10.818]  I'm a Zionist.
[03:50:10.818 --> 03:50:12.039]  You know that.
[03:50:12.039 --> 03:50:13.780]  I believe in the state of Israel.
[03:50:13.780 --> 03:50:16.102]  And most Jews are not to the left.
[03:50:16.102 --> 03:50:19.144]  Most Jews are either conservative or moderate.
[03:50:19.144 --> 03:50:21.625]  And what's happening right now is the Jewish left.
[03:50:21.625 --> 03:50:23.607]  You see it in the universities, the professors.
[03:50:23.607 --> 03:50:27.089]  You see it on the cable networks like CNN, MSNBC.
[03:50:27.952 --> 03:50:32.675]  You see it with individuals like George Soros, who's not really, in his heart, Jewish at all.
[03:50:32.675 --> 03:50:35.256]  He's actually an anti-Semite in his own right.
[03:50:35.256 --> 03:50:37.438]  He's funding a lot of this activity.
[03:50:37.438 --> 03:50:45.242]  He and his dad actually took away property from Jews going to their deaths in concentration camps during World War II to save their own skin.
[03:50:45.242 --> 03:50:48.324]  I couldn't look at myself in the mirror after that.
[03:50:48.324 --> 03:50:52.107]  I would rather die in a concentration camp than sell out my own people.
[03:50:52.107 --> 03:50:54.468]  Well, here's what's happening.
[03:50:54.468 --> 03:50:56.049]  People are getting the wrong impression.
[03:50:56.676 --> 03:51:16.553]  That Jewish people are against democracy, that they're against the Trump administration that was rightfully voted into power, and even the lunatic like this neo-Nazi who killed 11 Jewish people at the synagogue that you used to attend to, cited Jewish people as the reason for bringing radical Muslim terrorists into this country.
[03:51:16.553 --> 03:51:17.794]  And you know what?
[03:51:17.794 --> 03:51:22.738]  Regrettably, there's some truth to that, because you have the Anti-Defamation League, which is very far left,
[03:51:23.699 --> 03:51:35.268]  They were actually aiding the Council for American-Islamic Relations, which has terrorist links, in opposing President Trump's greater degree of vetting of immigration from Muslim countries.
[03:51:35.268 --> 03:51:41.293]  Not all Muslims are terrorists, we know that, and we're not trying to ban all Muslims from the United States, but this was reasonable.
[03:51:41.293 --> 03:51:46.397]  And there you have these leftist Jewish groups that are in fact sowing the seeds of their own destruction.
[03:51:46.397 --> 03:51:48.639]  These people, if it had been
[03:51:49.588 --> 03:51:54.209]  After World War II, we'd still get onto boxcars, thinking that they were going to summer camp.
[03:51:54.209 --> 03:51:58.770]  They're not just naive, but they have a visceral hatred to conservatives.
[03:51:58.770 --> 03:52:01.890]  And we have to relate to what's happened to our black friends.
[03:52:01.890 --> 03:52:03.611]  I have many black conservative friends.
[03:52:03.611 --> 03:52:14.473]  One's Demetric Penny, a police officer in Dallas who brought a case against the ultimate anti-Semite, Louis Farrakhan, when Farrakhan incited death against his fellow police officers there.
[03:52:15.288 --> 03:52:21.410]  And he was vilified, his Uncle Tom, a house end, everything else, his lives were threatened.
[03:52:21.410 --> 03:52:23.351]  So we Jews have to stand up.
[03:52:23.351 --> 03:52:24.251]  We don't stand for that.
[03:52:24.251 --> 03:52:31.454]  We are not Jews like Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Saul Alinsky, or the other people that you've mentioned.
[03:52:31.454 --> 03:52:33.415]  We believe in democracy.
[03:52:33.415 --> 03:52:35.075]  We believe in freedom.
[03:52:35.075 --> 03:52:39.317]  This land is our land, both here and in Israel, and most Jews are not
[03:52:39.992 --> 03:52:42.553]  radical leftists, and that's unfortunately what's happening.
[03:52:42.553 --> 03:52:48.195]  So I'm forming a group, and you're welcome to join, and other Christians are welcome to join as well.
[03:52:48.195 --> 03:52:49.496]  Like I said, I'm a Jewish Christian.
[03:52:49.496 --> 03:52:50.916]  Let's bring everybody together.
[03:52:50.916 --> 03:53:04.681]  It's going to be called the Coalition of the Jewish Right, and you can find that at freedomwatchusa.org, because I'm sick and tired of seeing the Jewish left destroy the fabric of this country, and we have to call it like it is.
[03:53:04.681 --> 03:53:06.262]  You and I can do it, because we're both Jewish.
[03:53:06.812 --> 03:53:09.354]  But if someone else did it, they'd be called anti-Semitic.
[03:53:09.354 --> 03:53:12.777]  But the reality is, we have a problem within our own people.
[03:53:12.777 --> 03:53:16.420]  They're not only trying to destroy the fabric of American society, but of Israel.
[03:53:16.420 --> 03:53:17.040]  Yeah.
[03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:27.089]  Well, Larry, I think there's a big difference between Jewish people being, we have a lot of conservative Jews, probably most are conservative, we have people that are liberal.
[03:53:27.089 --> 03:53:34.435]  The thing that bothers me, and I find particularly distressful and embarrassing, is when people like Dianne Feinstein, Adam Schiff,
[03:53:34.975 --> 03:53:35.915]  No, absolutely not.
[03:54:05.492 --> 03:54:10.095]  Well, and you and I don't worry about appearances, you know, Joel, but here's the thing.
[03:54:10.095 --> 03:54:26.624]  I mean, after the massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue, it was Jewish leaders from that synagogue, Jewish leaders like Adam Schiff, to use the term leaders loosely, like Jake Tapper on CNN, who's also Jewish, and others who branded the president an anti-Semite.
[03:54:26.624 --> 03:54:29.986]  This is the most pro-Jewish president in modern history.
[03:54:29.986 --> 03:54:30.966]  He loves Israel.
[03:54:30.966 --> 03:54:33.908]  To the contrary, our last president, Obama, was an anti-Semite.
[03:54:34.528 --> 03:54:39.956]  He identified with his half-Muslim self rather than all of the people.
[03:54:39.956 --> 03:54:41.178]  In fact, I said that once.
[03:54:41.178 --> 03:54:42.080]  I was vilified for it.
[03:54:42.080 --> 03:54:42.801]  I said it on the mall.
[03:54:43.976 --> 03:54:47.698]  Mr. President, get up off your knees, put the Quran down, and come out with your hands up.
[03:54:47.698 --> 03:54:48.759]  I said that figuratively.
[03:54:48.759 --> 03:54:50.539]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:54:50.539 --> 03:54:55.502]  Obviously, you were being facetious, but Obama put this Iran deal in place.
[03:54:55.502 --> 03:54:57.843]  He snubbed Bibi Netanyahu.
[03:54:57.843 --> 03:55:05.227]  He was interested in Muslim outreach and was very friendly with Israel's worst enemies, including Hamas.
[03:55:05.227 --> 03:55:09.649]  Whereas Trump, as they say, he's almost, like you said, Bill Clinton was the first black president.
[03:55:09.649 --> 03:55:11.790]  Trump is the first Jewish president.
[03:55:12.381 --> 03:55:20.327]  Because he moved the embassy to Jerusalem, and he's so interested, he understands the dynamic in the Middle East, and why Israel is an asset to U.S.
[03:55:20.327 --> 03:55:21.547]  security.
[03:55:21.547 --> 03:55:25.010]  Well, and that's what triggered it with me, and that's why I'm speaking out and forming this group.
[03:55:25.010 --> 03:55:28.572]  That was the final straw that broke the camel's back.
[03:55:28.572 --> 03:55:31.054]  The Jewish camel's back, I might say.
[03:55:31.054 --> 03:55:39.160]  Because to actually attack the one president who is a friend of the Jewish people in modern history, I mean, Jimmy Carter was no friend.
[03:55:39.160 --> 03:55:40.921]  And neither was Barack Obama.
[03:55:41.565 --> 03:55:49.613]  And someone who has moved that embassy to Jerusalem and to have leftist Jews call him an anti-Semite is the pot calling the kettle black.
[03:55:49.613 --> 03:55:53.778]  And I'm sorry to say it, but our people have disgraced our own people.
[03:55:53.778 --> 03:55:55.800]  And I don't consider these people Jews anymore.
[03:55:55.800 --> 03:55:57.081]  I really don't.
[03:55:57.081 --> 03:55:59.544]  Because they don't live by the tenets of the Ten Commandments.
[03:56:00.447 --> 03:56:11.093]  Well, we've seen this phenomenon in England and other far-left movements, the British Labour Party, where the far-left cozies up to the radical left and they become anti-semitic themselves.
[03:56:11.093 --> 03:56:17.277]  Is this what's happening to the Democrat Party despite having several prominent Jewish leaders?
[03:56:17.277 --> 03:56:17.797]  That's true.
[03:56:17.797 --> 03:56:23.320]  I mean, look at Bernie Sanders, who despises Israel, who disclaims his Jewish heritage.
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:26.922]  This is a guy who took his honeymoon in Moscow, okay?
[03:56:26.922 --> 03:56:28.583]  I mean, Moscow, the home of
[03:56:29.423 --> 03:56:30.364]  In effect, atheism.
[03:56:30.364 --> 03:56:33.908]  He worshipped the state rather than worshipping God.
[03:56:33.908 --> 03:56:35.710]  And he's just one example among many.
[03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:37.673]  Adam Schiff is an absolute disgrace.
[03:56:37.673 --> 03:56:40.616]  The congressman from West Hollywood.
[03:56:40.616 --> 03:56:43.639]  And he's somebody who, you know, lies through his teeth.
[03:56:43.639 --> 03:56:47.224]  And he got up there last Sunday with Jake Tapper and some others.
[03:56:47.224 --> 03:56:49.246]  Also, Tom Steyer from California.
[03:56:49.246 --> 03:56:50.087]  His dad was Jewish.
[03:56:50.672 --> 03:56:53.134]  And they just trash Trump for being an anti-Semite.
[03:56:53.134 --> 03:56:53.895]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[03:56:53.895 --> 03:56:55.657]  They are the anti-Semites.
[03:56:55.657 --> 03:57:02.423]  Because they are the ones who are besmirching Judeo-Christian heritage, thought, and the religion.
[03:57:02.423 --> 03:57:03.404]  Because if you're a true Jew...
[03:57:04.817 --> 03:57:09.081]  You would never act this way.
[03:57:09.081 --> 03:57:10.622]  We only got a few seconds left.
[03:57:10.622 --> 03:57:26.314]  Larry, you're pointing out you're starting an organization called The Jewish Right, helping to point out that there are so many Jewish conservatives and patriots in this country, and not letting these radical leftists speak for Jewish people against the president.
[03:57:26.314 --> 03:57:27.275]  Well, thanks for being here.
[03:57:28.536 --> 03:57:30.177]  Go to freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:57:30.177 --> 03:57:32.757]  We had a short show today, but I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
[03:57:32.757 --> 03:57:37.979]  Everyone get out and vote, vote, vote!
[03:57:37.979 --> 03:57:48.842]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:57:50.549 --> 03:57:53.692]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:57:53.692 --> 03:57:56.354]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:57:56.354 --> 03:58:00.637]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:58:00.637 --> 03:58:08.143]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:58:08.143 --> 03:58:10.565]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[03:58:13.985 --> 03:58:16.206]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:58:16.206 --> 03:58:19.246]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:58:19.246 --> 03:58:31.169]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:58:31.169 --> 03:58:33.510]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:58:33.510 --> 03:58:36.430]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:58:36.430 --> 03:58:37.491]  I mean, what?
[03:58:37.491 --> 03:58:38.331]  I mean, never!
[03:58:44.235 --> 03:58:48.378]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:58:48.378 --> 03:58:55.422]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:58:55.422 --> 03:59:00.245]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:59:00.245 --> 03:59:07.129]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[03:59:07.549 --> 03:59:07.989]  We're good to go!
[03:59:31.500 --> 03:59:32.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
