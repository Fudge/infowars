[00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.060]  Junior Brown and the Surf Medley.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.921]  Steel guitar.
[00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:24.823]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:29.025]  You know, when I was 18, you could go down here to Junior Brown at the Continental Club for $2.
[00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:33.226]  Al, of course, he's a big hit in Nashville.
[00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:36.187]  He's one of those guys that's a 30-year overnight success.
[00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:38.868]  Listen to that.
[00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:40.229]  He plays Surf Medley better than anybody.
[00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:44.664]  Ben Garrison's our guest.
[00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:49.769]  I got pretty wound up today on air, and everybody knows that Ben behind the scenes, that's not an act with me.
[00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.433]  I've studied history, so I know real authoritarianism when I see it.
[00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:58.437]  And I see the globalists that run our country allied with communist China.
[00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:04.342]  They're totally ruthless, and all of you that are siding with Hollywood, mainstream media,
[00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:08.547]  I don't even hate you.
[00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:09.989]  I hate the controllers.
[00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.156]  I am frustrated that I'm not smart enough, that's it, to save you.
[00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:20.262]  And I don't mean that as some goody-two-shoes thing, you know, some savior complex.
[00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:22.485]  I mean, I need to save you to get my family out of this.
[00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:25.349]  See, I think of you as myself because I know we're all interconnected.
[00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:32.767]  And Ben Garrison, top editorial cartoonist in the world, and it really is true.
[00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:34.688]  You don't want to say that until you realize it.
[00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.290]  He's here with us, and we're taking some phone calls.
[00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.490]  Paul Watson's about to take over.
[00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.811]  We're going to go to Pennsylvania.
[00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:43.314]  We're going to talk to Holly, who's been holding very patiently about the omnibus.
[00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:44.895]  As Garrison said, he's right.
[00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:45.995]  It's not a budget.
[00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:47.516]  That's for the year.
[00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:50.398]  It's one of 12 bills a year when they combine them for spending.
[00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:51.819]  Everybody got on my ass.
[00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.480]  I love the audience is so informed.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.703]  I said, it's just... Holly, you're on the air with Ben Garrison.
[00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:57.023]  Go ahead.
[00:01:57.843 --> 00:01:58.363]  Hi, Ben.
[00:01:58.404 --> 00:01:59.504]  Hi, Alex.
[00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:00.765]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:09.069]  Real quick, how about a bumper sticker that says gun-free zones are where the shootings happen?
[00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.990]  Well, that's totally true.
[00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:18.718]  There are some good public schools in this country with some good people at them, but if they're blue city areas, the police always stand down.
[00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:24.042]  Why would you send your child to the only place they statistically might get killed by a lunatic?
[00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:26.785]  Because the media advertises that's where a lunatic goes.
[00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:27.585]  Ben Garrison.
[00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:31.128]  Yeah, isn't that the case?
[00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:41.336]  You know, I've noticed another thing you mentioned about Hollywood is that you watch these movies and you see them, if somebody brings out a gun, oh, do you have a permit for that?
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.684]  And I always think the perfect line is, yes, my permit is a Second Amendment.
[00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:48.986]  They've demonized these guns.
[00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:53.971]  And boy, you watch Bill Maher, I watch him every week because I like to see what the enemies are doing.
[00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.174]  He's really pushing this idea that
[00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.531]  Gun ownership should be a privilege.
[00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:14.018]  Now, if they ever do that, where they make gun ownership a privilege, you might as well kiss your guns goodbye, because they'll make the permit process and the testing so elaborate and impossible, the fees, the fines... It'll be like New York City, where only basically the mafia and a few thousand have it.
[00:03:14.338 --> 00:03:15.438]  Well, exactly.
[00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:18.400]  I watched Bill Maher two weeks ago when I was in Colorado, just happened to catch it.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.521]  He's like, it's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:23.842]  Well, that's what the Supreme Court Justice came out and said.
[00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:24.363]  I mean, they...
[00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:28.597]  Don't they get that we've been warning people forever and they were denying that, Ben?
[00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:47.286]  They keep pushing gradually, but now they seem to be going all out, which is actually in a way is good because all that's going to do is tighten our grip on our weapons are going to tighten the more they come out and say that.
[00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.811]  It's going to be okay.
[00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.532]  Well, let's get it on then.
[00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:52.533]  Come and try to take them.
[00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:53.314]  See what happens.
[00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:55.716]  All right, Ben Garrison, we salute you.
[00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:57.097]  We appreciate you.
[00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:00.660]  People can go to grrgraphics.com.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.160]  You're busy.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.560]  I'm busy.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.381]  We talked a year ago.
[00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.262]  I sold some of your books.
[00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:07.885]  I've got a whole plan to fund our operation and yours with limited edition prints.
[00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.126]  They're valuable to the audience.
[00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:10.447]  They become collectors.
[00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:13.069]  We need, you and I both, are so busy.
[00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.530]  Believe me.
[00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.251]  We need to get together.
[00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:16.272]  We need to launch a plan.
[00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:17.972]  And it's non-exclusive.
[00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.033]  You can sell whatever you want anywhere else.
[00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:25.175]  I want to do a deal with you with your best prints, so people can hang these in their shops, their businesses, their churches.
[00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.235]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:29.256]  So let's get on the phone today or tomorrow.
[00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.997]  Let's just have it happen, because I don't do it and a year goes by.
[00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:34.418]  And let's do that, because we've all got to come together.
[00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:40.760]  The audience wants to support the economy of freedom, support free speech, and you're one of our leading voices, so thank you so much.
[00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:41.731]  Thank you.
[00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:45.517]  Alex, can I make a quick shout out to my friend Corey Simpson in Seattle?
[00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:47.660]  He's your biggest fan and he buys all your stuff.
[00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:49.503]  And he's really devoted to you.
[00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:51.205]  So I just had to mention his name.
[00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:52.086]  Absolutely.
[00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:52.848]  God bless him.
[00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:54.530]  All right, I'll introduce Paul Watson.
[00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.632]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:56.152]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:12.599]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:20.906]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:25.751]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:32.674]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:39.817]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:46.780]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:51.282]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:54.624]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:55.825]  You can run on for a long time
[00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:22.855]  We're back live.
[00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:24.616]  Paul Watson's riding shotgun.
[00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:25.697]  I'm getting out of here in a segment.
[00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:26.778]  We're taking calls with Paul.
[00:06:26.818 --> 00:06:28.099]  He's got a big guest coming up.
[00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.590]  Don't forget, BrainForce Plus is 50% off our best-selling product and free shipping.
[00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.090]  You can also get the Real Red Pill.
[00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.131]  It's got free shipping.
[00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:41.072]  Now, they're both 50% off, but you've got to get them together to get the free shipping.
[00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:44.152]  You can get Red Pill, the Real Red Pill.
[00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:46.333]  It's 50% off.
[00:06:46.353 --> 00:06:48.973]  You can get BrainForce at 50% off, but get them together, free shipping.
[00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:49.893]  They go together.
[00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:52.394]  It takes about seven days for the Red Pill to kick in.
[00:06:52.414 --> 00:06:56.795]  It takes about 30 minutes for BrainForce to kick in, but that is a huge discount.
[00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:03.560]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, and you absolutely, by buying the products with us, have changed the whole game.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.880]  They're panicking, they don't know what to do.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.741]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.942]  Paul, tell us what you got coming up today, my friend.
[00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:22.966]  We've got Roaming Millennial coming up at the bottom of the hour, Alex, but before I get into that, I want to talk about this Second Amendment issue because, you know, they got new polls out today which show that
[00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:29.599]  The lead that Democrats had for the House going into the midterms, it was 15 points back in October.
[00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.102]  Everybody's been saying for months the Republicans are going to get an absolute shellacking.
[00:07:33.142 --> 00:07:34.123]  They're going to lose the House.
[00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:40.187]  Now, the polls say that lead is down to five points, almost within the margin of error.
[00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:45.691]  And typically in the past, if Democrats are slightly ahead in the polls, they've lost the House.
[00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:47.653]  So they have to be way ahead to win it.
[00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:53.497]  That's all, Alex, taken place over the last couple of months or so, especially in the last month.
[00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.494]  And I think it's related to this Second Amendment issue, okay?
[00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:02.939]  The march for our lives, as we know, was basically a recruitment voter drive for Democrats.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.083]  You know, less than 10% of the attendees were kids.
[00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.520]  They're doing it to recruit voters.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.960]  They don't care about gun violence.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.901]  I mean, it would be naive to think that they do.
[00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:13.281]  It's all about power, OK?
[00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:14.422]  So that's why they're doing it.
[00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:17.583]  But again, this Second Amendment issue is so toxic.
[00:08:18.003 --> 00:08:21.004]  They're not going to get significant gun control through this year.
[00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:24.766]  Maybe they'll get it next year if they get the House, but they're not going to get it this year.
[00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:32.549]  What single issue, Alex, would get Republicans out to vote in the midterms above all others?
[00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.929]  What fear would get them out to vote?
[00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:37.270]  Well, it would be the confiscation of their firearms.
[00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.831]  This is backfiring.
[00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:43.592]  It's backfiring big time, especially now that we see the true face of it.
[00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.814]  With this call, you know, you saw the protest signs on Saturday.
[00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:47.994]  Ban all guns.
[00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:49.835]  We're going to take them from your cold, dead hands.
[00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:50.575]  You've got the
[00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:55.087]  New York Times editorial today, op-ed, repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:56.868]  This is going to backfire.
[00:08:56.928 --> 00:09:01.112]  This is working in our favour because it might get Republicans out to vote.
[00:09:01.412 --> 00:09:06.576]  It might give them an issue, you know, a point on which to vote which they don't have right now.
[00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:10.219]  This is going to backfire and the polls suggest that it already is.
[00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:12.621]  So far from being worried about this,
[00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:16.580]  We should be supporting the Parkland students.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:29.225]  We should be encouraging them to continue getting up on national media platforms, calling for all guns to be banned, doing it in the kind of vulgar language that we've seen from David Hogg recently, because it's not good PR.
[00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:32.946]  It's blowing up in their faces, and the polls are beginning to show that.
[00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:36.548]  Trump's approval is up again as well, by the way, on a CNN poll.
[00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:41.208]  I think we really need to support the Parkland students.
[00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:48.513]  We need to amplify those who are calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment, because tactically, it's going to work in our favor.
[00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:51.435]  Paul, I know Gallup.
[00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:56.698]  I know the other major polls generally sample 9 to 15 points more Democrat.
[00:09:56.978 --> 00:09:57.939]  They claim there's more Democrats.
[00:09:57.979 --> 00:09:58.739]  That's not really true.
[00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:05.723]  And we saw that during the presidential campaign, and they admitted that it was fake, and that Trump was actually generally about 5, 10 points ahead.
[00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:12.418]  The problem is, I'm looking at their actions and the way they're behaving.
[00:10:12.838 --> 00:10:14.579]  They know short term this is going to hurt them.
[00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:17.420]  I think they're winding up jihadi attacks.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.401]  I think they know about other mental patients that are going to attack.
[00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:22.522]  Broward Cowards stood down.
[00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:24.482]  We believe the attack happened, but they stood down.
[00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:28.784]  And I think just like Vegas was tied to jihadis, that's now been confirmed.
[00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:33.865]  And we now have the Pulse nightclub father and son reportedly being FBI informants.
[00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:35.466]  We first broke that back when it happened.
[00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:45.631]  I think they've got some crazies they're watching that they know are getting ready to do something big that they're going to let attack and they've set this precedent saying never again, not one more.
[00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:55.256]  I agree the Stormy Daniels thing about consensual sex 11 years ago and him treating her great and then talking about not wearing a condom is so humiliating.
[00:10:55.517 --> 00:10:59.099]  How could you not feel sorry for the president who never claimed he was a goody two-shoes?
[00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.340]  It's like breaking into somebody's bedroom.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.440]  It's pure harassment.
[00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:03.321]  It's stalking.
[00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:07.702]  So yeah, that's got him even in CNN polls that sample twenty-something percent more Democrat.
[00:11:07.982 --> 00:11:09.923]  It's got him up, you know, five, six, seven points.
[00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:11.163]  Same thing with Gallup.
[00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:12.403]  Same thing with Mason Dixon.
[00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:15.184]  Same thing with, you know, all of these.
[00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:26.807]  I'm just saying, I don't think we can be too confident though, because Soros has successfully overthrown dozens of countries, including Ukraine four years ago, and they've got a plan.
[00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:28.627]  I agree they're arrogant.
[00:11:28.727 --> 00:11:30.388]  Why would you have Tarr?
[00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:35.310]  Go on and say, we're going to give us an inch, we'll take you a mile.
[00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:40.614]  Why would you have the former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens say, repeal the Second Amendment, mass gun confiscation?
[00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:44.577]  Why would you have Democrats say, we don't care, don't turn your guns in, we'll kill you?
[00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:48.640]  I'm going to ask you that question in a moment and let you take over with all the great job you're doing.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.563]  Paul Watson at Prison Planet on Twitter, one of the hottest Twitter accounts out there, despite the censorship.
[00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:56.165]  But let's go to Tar admitting Saturday their game plan.
[00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:01.502]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take.
[00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:03.103]  Like right now.
[00:12:03.904 --> 00:12:04.685]  Sign our petition.
[00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:07.248]  It takes two seconds, and it matters.
[00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:11.132]  We will take the big, and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting.
[00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:15.796]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:18.980]  We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here for real change.
[00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:22.424]  Again, she's up there.
[00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:25.806]  The very same group that funded Madonna to be there a year before the Women's March is funding this.
[00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:26.867]  Total astroturf.
[00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:30.650]  They tried to ban us from criticizing them a month ago, saying they were astroturf.
[00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.571]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:35.213]  Private jets, money, everything, Paul.
[00:12:35.794 --> 00:12:37.075]  What is their ace in the hole?
[00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:38.756]  Or are they just crazy?
[00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:41.957]  And think they can finally announce we're coming to take your guns.
[00:12:42.317 --> 00:12:43.637]  What type of strategy is that?
[00:12:43.657 --> 00:12:45.477]  Because Bill Maher said ban them two weeks ago.
[00:12:45.717 --> 00:12:46.697]  The New York Times said it.
[00:12:46.737 --> 00:12:47.137]  CNN.
[00:12:47.438 --> 00:12:51.098]  They're now, as a talking point, saying, fine, we're taking everything.
[00:12:51.358 --> 00:12:54.879]  Do they think psychologically we'll go, okay, just take the semi-autos?
[00:12:55.159 --> 00:13:04.781]  Do they, because we get the formula worldwide from where you live to Australia was to first ban the semi-autos, then ban people up to 21, you know, and then register.
[00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:06.301]  I mean, we know the formula, Paul.
[00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:18.566]  Well, I've seen other activists, prominent people within this March for Our Lives movement, saying to these others who are saying, yeah, let's just take all the guns, we'll take it from your cold dead hands.
[00:13:18.606 --> 00:13:21.930]  We saw the protest signs as well, saying basically we're going to do it violently.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.161]  They're saying, no, no, what are you doing?
[00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:25.902]  Stop saying that.
[00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:34.045]  Stop admitting that this is the true agenda because that's going to cause a massive resentment, a massive revolt amongst Republicans.
[00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:36.647]  And they'll go out and vote in these midterms.
[00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:40.949]  These polls, they've gone from 15 points Democrats in front.
[00:13:41.309 --> 00:13:42.569]  Everyone's pessimistic.
[00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:43.510]  It was a lost cause.
[00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.631]  Now it's down to a five point lead.
[00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.452]  It's almost within the margin of error.
[00:13:47.752 --> 00:13:50.474]  And it's happened while this gun control narrative has built up.
[00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:54.616]  So you've got people within that movement saying, what on earth are you doing?
[00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:56.397]  Saying we're going to take all the guns.
[00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:56.837]  Exactly.
[00:13:57.218 --> 00:13:58.558]  If you give us an inch, we'll take a mile.
[00:13:58.598 --> 00:13:59.159]  What are you doing?
[00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.560]  So I think it's a massive strategic error.
[00:14:02.061 --> 00:14:04.302]  Also, the other factor that I've pointed to is
[00:14:04.963 --> 00:14:19.823]  Never in this discussion of, oh, we're going to confiscate all the guns, we're going to repeal the Second Amendment, is the question of what consequences are you going to see if you take 300 million guns from roughly 70 million American gun owners
[00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:26.889]  Even if, Alex, 1% of those people resisted, and the media is going to be all like, oh, you're calling for civil war.
[00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:27.089]  No.
[00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:37.479]  We're asking, what will the potential consequences be if you have police or whoever, military confiscating millions and millions of guns from people who don't want to give them up?
[00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.591]  That question is never asked.
[00:14:39.652 --> 00:14:41.173]  It's never part of this narrative.
[00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:43.055]  So that's another issue.
[00:14:43.335 --> 00:14:46.417]  But I think it's a massive strategic error on their part.
[00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:49.860]  We've seen the teeth of this movement.
[00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:50.761]  I totally agree.
[00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:55.826]  So then why is Trump paying it lip service and finally starting to go sideways here?
[00:14:57.236 --> 00:14:59.879]  Well why did he sign the omnibus bill?
[00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:00.620]  It's the same thing.
[00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.243]  The base needs to hold his feet to the fire.
[00:15:03.283 --> 00:15:07.989]  We've done it before with Syria where that was a mistake and then they backtracked from it.
[00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:09.050]  It hasn't happened since.
[00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:12.014]  So don't give them that inch in the first place.
[00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:14.957]  That's one thing we can do, put pressure on Trump also.
[00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:18.902]  Alex, don't interrupt the enemy when it's making a mistake.
[00:15:19.062 --> 00:15:20.744]  They're making a huge mistake right now.
[00:15:21.044 --> 00:15:23.688]  Let's give them a platform to keep saying the same thing.
[00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:28.213]  Because it's working against their favor politically right now and in the polls.
[00:15:28.393 --> 00:15:28.773]  That's right.
[00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:33.719]  Trump is a populist, a free market classic America, but really kind of a libertarian liberal.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.660]  He was anti-war.
[00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:39.082]  He is kind of a liberal, but in a good way.
[00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:46.044]  And so his wife and his daughters are telling him to do the gun control, and it's horrible advice, Trump.
[00:15:46.184 --> 00:15:47.425]  It's terrible advice.
[00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:48.945]  Alright, I'm sorry to the other callers.
[00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:49.465]  We're out of time.
[00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:50.286]  Paul's taking over.
[00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:51.846]  Chris and everybody else, we love you.
[00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:52.506]  Put them all on hold.
[00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:53.287]  Give them a free t-shirt.
[00:15:53.527 --> 00:15:54.027]  Whatever they want.
[00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:54.467]  They're awesome.
[00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:55.387]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:55.627 --> 00:15:56.868]  Great job to the crew, by the way.
[00:15:57.128 --> 00:15:58.549]  The war room's coming up in 45 minutes.
[00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:00.349]  But first, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:01.970]  Spread the live links right now.
[00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.470]  We're changing...
[00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:22.864]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:22.964 --> 00:16:28.368]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:29.929]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:33.192]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:34.812]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.373 --> 00:16:36.493]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:38.434]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:44.156]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:45.457]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:47.398]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.498 --> 00:16:49.879]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.339]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.340]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.481]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:55.901]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.041 --> 00:16:57.202]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:02.728 --> 00:17:06.170]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:13.215]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics, or brain pills, are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:18.259]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:18.799]  It's very simple.
[00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:19.940]  We went out and looked.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.540]  What is the top?
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.161]  What is the best?
[00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:22.742]  We'll just put even more product in.
[00:17:22.762 --> 00:17:23.362]  We'll make it better.
[00:17:23.482 --> 00:17:25.243]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:17:25.283 --> 00:17:26.324]  We put $10 in it, and sell it for $30.
[00:17:26.444 --> 00:17:27.185]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:35.010]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.313]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:17:39.593 --> 00:17:43.416]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:46.878]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:17:47.318 --> 00:17:50.240]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.903]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:17:54.123 --> 00:17:56.424]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:17:56.724 --> 00:17:57.425]  It's amazing.
[00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:00.167]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:06.511]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:14.456]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:18:15.156 --> 00:18:19.879]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.381]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:26.444]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:18:27.244 --> 00:18:29.706]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:37.028]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:18:37.628 --> 00:18:44.869]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:52.391]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:54.031]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:56.212]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:57.052 --> 00:19:00.016]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:19:00.536 --> 00:19:02.258]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.300]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.801]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:09.202]  Go ahead.
[00:19:09.302 --> 00:19:09.582]  Yes.
[00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:10.723]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:10.863 --> 00:19:17.068]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:17.268 --> 00:19:21.251]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:21.492 --> 00:19:22.933]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:30.019]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:32.941]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:33.821 --> 00:19:38.522]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:38.562 --> 00:19:46.384]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:46.404 --> 00:19:52.225]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:57.666]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:00.747]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:10.666]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:36.012]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:36.252 --> 00:20:37.433]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:37.893 --> 00:20:42.437]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:49.862]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take.
[00:20:50.836 --> 00:20:51.456]  Like right now.
[00:20:52.277 --> 00:20:53.018]  Sign our petition.
[00:20:53.758 --> 00:20:55.619]  It takes two seconds, and it matters.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.502]  We will take the big, and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting.
[00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:04.226]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:07.368]  We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here for real change.
[00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:11.905]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:21:11.945 --> 00:21:12.705]  Mike Cernovich is here.
[00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:14.346]  Your phone call is coming up next segment.
[00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:19.749]  I'm going to get into Russia with him as well and what Trump's up to and what his information is on what's happening inside the Trump administration.
[00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:27.634]  But you were getting into the incredible persecution of conservatives, libertarians, of just nationalists, of just free speech activists.
[00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:29.215]  You're a lawyer in your own right.
[00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:33.097]  I know you've looked over some of the lawsuits against us, and I'm not just putting a good face on it.
[00:21:33.557 --> 00:21:34.418]  These will cost money.
[00:21:34.438 --> 00:21:35.138]  We've got to beat them.
[00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:39.501]  But my lawyers tell me, some of the top guys in the country defamation-wise, they say
[00:21:41.243 --> 00:21:42.744]  We've never seen suits like these.
[00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:48.146]  These are defamatory themselves, but it's defamation protected by court because it's in a lawsuit.
[00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:54.448]  And again, they even say, Jones says that they were connected to the FBI, that Umar Mateen was.
[00:21:54.488 --> 00:21:56.049]  Well, that was in the news then, it's in the news now.
[00:21:56.949 --> 00:22:04.315]  So, it's just next level, this intimidation, and where they're going, and it makes me ask, what's the next step?
[00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:07.998]  Just in the violent rhetoric, and where are the Republicans?
[00:22:08.358 --> 00:22:09.219]  Where is Trump?
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.301]  It's just crazy.
[00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:16.021]  Well, I mean, the next step is for them, for us to be assassinated.
[00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:18.842]  I mean, there's no, there's no nice way to put it.
[00:22:19.323 --> 00:22:23.845]  We all know that the Family Research Council shooting happened in 2013.
[00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:28.988]  A man, Floyd Lee Corkins, went on to the SPLC target list website.
[00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:31.789]  He went in to murder as many people.
[00:22:31.829 --> 00:22:32.510]  This is what he said.
[00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.791]  He said, I want to kill as many people, he said.
[00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:38.253]  He said he wanted to kill as many people as possible.
[00:22:39.102 --> 00:22:44.227]  And he said this to the FBI, and the only reason he was stopped was by a good guy with a gun.
[00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:53.936]  So the SPLC has actually, directly, in ways that you and I never have, even though the fake news wants to say otherwise, directly incited a mass shooter.
[00:22:54.296 --> 00:22:55.037]  Media doesn't care.
[00:22:55.297 --> 00:22:56.218]  They don't talk about that.
[00:22:56.478 --> 00:22:57.379]  They don't report that.
[00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:03.345]  Instead, they'll dox four young Jewish women because they don't like the mom, Pamela Geller,
[00:23:04.505 --> 00:23:14.953]  The left's always been dirty and bad worldwide and I thought that maybe they were nicer here, but really it's just time in the phase for them to go into the red terror.
[00:23:16.454 --> 00:23:18.395]  Yeah, every day that I wake up
[00:23:19.282 --> 00:23:23.344]  Is for me a relief that I haven't been murdered or targeted.
[00:23:23.424 --> 00:23:26.225]  I haven't been targeted for assassination, of course.
[00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:27.265]  There's no question.
[00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:28.926]  The Family Research Council happened.
[00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:37.709]  I mean, if you, if somebody said they went on our website and they clicked on a target list and they went to commit a shooting, oh my God.
[00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:41.310]  Because they called it a targeting list for those that don't know.
[00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:42.656]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:42.676 --> 00:23:46.979]  So the SPLC literally has a target list, and then a man goes on a mass shooting.
[00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:49.561]  The SPLC has never apologized to the victims.
[00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:51.902]  They have not disavowed that shooting.
[00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:55.065]  They try to pretend it doesn't happen, and the media is complicit.
[00:23:55.365 --> 00:24:04.991]  There are maybe four or five articles, tops on it, and they bury the lead about how that was a direct incitement by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:09.174]  And now the Southern Poverty Law Center had 10,000 people hired by YouTube and Google to censor us.
[00:24:09.494 --> 00:24:11.896]  What do you make of that whole purge that's still ongoing?
[00:24:12.876 --> 00:24:16.998]  Well, my YouTube channel, I was gaining 1,500 new subscribers a day.
[00:24:17.738 --> 00:24:32.864]  My videos were doing 20,000 views a day, and now I actually hardly even do much on YouTube because my videos are doing like 1,500 views, 2,000 views, because the SPLC has unsubscribed people and gutted my YouTube channel.
[00:24:32.884 --> 00:24:33.865]  They've already taken over.
[00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:35.026]  We're good to go.
[00:24:44.662 --> 00:24:50.288]  Yeah, I actually, this was last week, I have 66,000 subscribers even after the unsubscribes.
[00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:53.712]  I had three live viewers, Alex, when I went and did a live stream.
[00:24:53.832 --> 00:24:55.394]  No, no, I saw you link to that show.
[00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:56.155]  That's impossible.
[00:24:56.415 --> 00:25:00.860]  They're not even, that means three people had to be on your YouTube page to see it.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.341]  That's called shadow banning.
[00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:05.485]  You were not able to hit any of the subscribers.
[00:25:06.488 --> 00:25:12.355]  Yeah, and it's interesting, and then I'll point that out, and then suddenly, like, the next day, then I'll get a couple hundred or something.
[00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:16.400]  And then, you know, because they think that we're going to forget about it and not pay attention, right?
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:22.387]  So three live viewers on a 66,000 subscriber channel, it just doesn't really add up.
[00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:26.452]  So what they're doing is they're trying to play a PSYOP.
[00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:31.343]  Hey, hey, we're banned from our main channel from streaming still, so at least you get your three.
[00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.405]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:25:32.485 --> 00:25:33.307]  It's here, folks.
[00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:37.036]  It's here, and it's the so-called left, the champions of speech that are doing it.
[00:25:38.106 --> 00:25:50.309]  Yeah, I actually unpublished every YouTube video that I'd ever done because what they'd done is they went back to someone's channel, he was actually Wayne Dupree, African-American, very powerful man, powerful voice.
[00:25:50.929 --> 00:25:52.489]  They found a video from four years ago.
[00:25:52.929 --> 00:26:00.951]  So they're going through every video and watching every video with a fine-tooth comb and if you say one wrong word or one foul language or
[00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:05.213]  You know, there's a word that begins with C. That was common during the election.
[00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:11.876]  They've decided now that if you say anything like that, even four years ago, they'll ban you or they'll, you know, they'll suspend it.
[00:26:11.936 --> 00:26:13.337]  So that's where we are, Alex.
[00:26:13.357 --> 00:26:14.077]  That's why I told people that.
[00:26:14.097 --> 00:26:16.218]  Let me ask you this, because I'm asking a lot of questions.
[00:26:16.259 --> 00:26:17.099]  What's on your radar?
[00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:18.099]  What's next?
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.461]  How'd the big gun grab march go yesterday?
[00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:21.181]  I know you made the point.
[00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:22.942]  Where are the Republicans in the funding?
[00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:24.483]  I mean, this is the real fight.
[00:26:24.503 --> 00:26:25.723]  This is bigger than the election 2016.
[00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:27.884]  People better understand that.
[00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:30.886]  Yeah, it was a highly successful march.
[00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:38.457]  And the left has shown that they can mobilize and organize and bust people in less than a month.
[00:26:38.957 --> 00:26:43.219]  So if the Democrats can get 800,000 people out into Washington, D.C.
[00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:46.740]  alone, and they can have coordinated marches all throughout the country,
[00:26:47.748 --> 00:26:50.230]  That shows that they can bust people in.
[00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.492]  There is going to be a major blue wave in November.
[00:26:53.872 --> 00:26:54.973]  There's no question about it.
[00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:56.374]  The Republicans don't want to win.
[00:26:56.914 --> 00:27:02.598]  Trump, Trump went on stage with Charlie Kirk and said, oh, Antifa, is it really a big deal?
[00:27:03.018 --> 00:27:03.739]  You know who?
[00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:05.560]  Oh, they just get too much attention.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.103]  Despite the fact that multiple Trump supporters have been assaulted and almost murdered.
[00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:15.807]  And in fact, that there's a pending criminal case in New York where an Antifa terrorist attempted to murder.
[00:27:15.847 --> 00:27:17.328]  He's charged with mob action.
[00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:34.642]  Oh no, I saw Trump in that interview that he did, and it was on Fox last Friday, and I'm not trying to attack Trump, it's true, they go, you know, they really attack us on campus, and we're being shut down nationwide, our 20,000 campus groups.
[00:27:34.963 --> 00:27:36.924]  Trump goes, yeah, but you're still really popular.
[00:27:37.245 --> 00:27:40.988]  The left, nobody really agrees with them, and the guest host is like,
[00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:43.229]  No, they're attacking us and shutting us down.
[00:27:43.609 --> 00:27:45.891]  He's there telling the president, we're under attack.
[00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.132]  We need federal funding to be pulled from these universities.
[00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:57.197]  These universities are out of control, saying no whites on the weekend, no whites on the commons, and it's weird white teachers leading this classic racism crap.
[00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:00.299]  I mean, Trump, have they compromised him?
[00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:05.282]  Because I got to be honest here, he's still doing a lot of great things, but man, I mean, he is starting to really slide.
[00:28:05.442 --> 00:28:07.143]  What in the hell is going on, Mike?
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:19.068]  Well, I'll tell you the truth that nobody really wants to hear, and it's cost me thousands of followers, and I'm fine with that, so I don't want anybody to blame you for what I'm about to say, but I'll just tell you the truth.
[00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:25.033]  If Alec Baldwin makes fun of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, Trump will tweet about it.
[00:28:25.694 --> 00:28:28.696]  If a Trump supporter in a Trump hat is knocked unconscious,
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.742]  Trump says it's no big deal.
[00:28:31.122 --> 00:28:37.991]  I just don't see him caring about the patriots who are on the front lines really making things happen.
[00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:40.955]  Does he know how much those people love him and how important they are?
[00:28:40.975 --> 00:28:42.557]  Because I know for a fact he does.
[00:28:42.577 --> 00:28:44.720]  I think he's in a bubble and doesn't know.
[00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:49.396]  Well, I'm only going to apologize for him for so much.
[00:28:50.156 --> 00:28:50.656]  No, I hear you.
[00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:51.136]  Well, you know what?
[00:28:51.176 --> 00:28:51.517]  You know what?
[00:28:51.537 --> 00:28:52.417]  Because it's fair to do.
[00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:55.638]  Let's look at the negative of Trump when we come back and go to phone calls.
[00:28:55.658 --> 00:29:01.299]  Because what I've been told is you've got to get on his butt, and us just blindly supporting him makes him go to sleep.
[00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:02.720]  So let's go after Trump when we come back.
[00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:16.327]  I was talking to Steven Seagal last night and this morning and he had some very heartfelt, very, I think, compelling things to say that just at a gut level rang true to me.
[00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:18.868]  Plus what we've seen what's been done to the president, now admitted.
[00:29:18.928 --> 00:29:23.469]  Some women offered up two million big Democratic Party donors to say that Trump raped them.
[00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:25.049]  The women have recorded this.
[00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:26.350]  I know the FBI has it.
[00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.810]  We first broke that months ago.
[00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:28.830]  That's now been in the news.
[00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.791]  So we know there's a bunch of foul play going on.
[00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:34.652]  I don't know personally about this latest thing or what happened.
[00:29:35.572 --> 00:29:36.793]  One, I think this person's a great person.
[00:29:36.813 --> 00:29:37.914]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[00:29:38.394 --> 00:29:42.277]  I just know Steven Seagal and his lawyers, a former, you know, star prosecutor.
[00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:44.058]  What they're saying, I've followed.
[00:29:44.758 --> 00:29:45.559]  It has gone on.
[00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:46.639]  The story's very vague.
[00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:47.440]  A lot of it's wrong.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.721]  Now things are being added.
[00:29:48.741 --> 00:29:53.304]  The thing that I find interesting is this woman is saying she was in my movie.
[00:29:53.664 --> 00:29:55.645]  There's no record of her being in my movie.
[00:29:55.906 --> 00:29:56.846]  She doesn't have a credit.
[00:29:57.126 --> 00:29:58.027]  We've looked through the movie.
[00:29:58.067 --> 00:29:59.148]  She's not in the movie.
[00:29:59.508 --> 00:30:02.190]  She says she came to my home in Beverly Hills.
[00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.670]  Guess what?
[00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.952]  I didn't have a home in Beverly Hills.
[00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:06.893]  I think these are all made-up stories.
[00:30:07.754 --> 00:30:19.882]  And, you know, I not only resent it, but this is something that is designed to destroy my life, destroy my income, destroy my marriage, destroy my children and my children's lives.
[00:30:20.142 --> 00:30:21.583]  And it is evil, but they're good.
[00:30:22.103 --> 00:30:26.144]  We have 90-95% fake journalism, fake news.
[00:30:26.164 --> 00:30:31.286]  90-95% of the news in the American eye is fake news.
[00:30:31.386 --> 00:30:35.387]  So nobody, as I said to you before, nobody knows what's true and what's not.
[00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:44.509]  And when you're in a situation like that where you don't know what's true and what's not, how can you weather the storm?
[00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:45.869]  How can you walk forward?
[00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.530]  How can you do anything?
[00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:51.175]  Yeah, and know that you're right about what you're doing.
[00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:53.478]  How can you make a decision and know that you're right?
[00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:57.483]  You know, like I say, there's a deeper, deeper, darker picture here going on.
[00:30:58.265 --> 00:31:03.252]  And what's really happening, in my opinion, is not just the witch hunt and the McCarthyism.
[00:31:03.772 --> 00:31:14.959]  But it's also, I believe, and I shouldn't be the one to say this, but I will, and I'm sure you'll confirm it, I'm also being persecuted for my political views and my political affiliation.
[00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:18.902]  There is a secret society within our government.
[00:31:18.922 --> 00:31:21.283]  This is a full coup d'etat right now.
[00:31:21.643 --> 00:31:23.364]  It's just secret.
[00:31:23.384 --> 00:31:31.910]  And Congress is interviewing informants right now that are talking about this, and they are completely confirming that the sole purpose of this
[00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:43.361]  Our secret society is to overthrow Trump and destroy anyone who is friends with Trump or supporting Trump, and particularly supporting Putin.
[00:31:43.881 --> 00:31:52.169]  And once they do this, their agenda is to be able to overthrow the America that is there now and start a war with Russia.
[00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:57.174]  That's what we all are starting to see.
[00:32:07.423 --> 00:32:10.524]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:32:10.564 --> 00:32:11.084]  You're on the air.
[00:32:11.104 --> 00:32:11.645]  Thanks for holding.
[00:32:11.885 --> 00:32:13.125]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:32:13.345 --> 00:32:13.966]  Hey, brother.
[00:32:14.246 --> 00:32:14.606]  Good, man.
[00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:15.746]  Thank you for calling.
[00:32:15.786 --> 00:32:20.588]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:32:20.788 --> 00:32:27.171]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:29.291]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:32:29.311 --> 00:32:36.054]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:32:36.394 --> 00:32:37.515]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:32:37.575 --> 00:32:41.579]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.581]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:44.762]  And exactly.
[00:32:44.782 --> 00:32:49.027]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:32:49.387 --> 00:32:49.647]  Boom!
[00:32:49.807 --> 00:32:52.630]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.231]  It's amazing.
[00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:57.515]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:33:08.337 --> 00:33:11.078]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.906 --> 00:33:28.127]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:28.547 --> 00:33:33.710]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:35.672 --> 00:33:37.393]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[00:33:37.473 --> 00:33:42.155]  Mike Cernovich is our guest, but I'm very thankful for President Trump.
[00:33:43.175 --> 00:33:52.079]  I like the things he's done on NAFTA and GATT, the TPP and tariffs on China, and the $4 trillion, the stock market, the 2 million new jobs.
[00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:52.939]  I'm not going to go through that all.
[00:33:52.959 --> 00:33:53.640]  It'll take a long time.
[00:33:54.844 --> 00:33:58.226]  Markedly, in the last month, I've seen some big changes.
[00:33:58.306 --> 00:34:00.487]  But the big one isn't even that omnibus.
[00:34:00.507 --> 00:34:02.168]  Because he got handed that by Congress.
[00:34:02.528 --> 00:34:03.848]  That would have stalled the whole government.
[00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:04.789]  It's big pork barrel.
[00:34:04.849 --> 00:34:07.670]  I'm not saying I absolve him, but I understand why he did it.
[00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.111]  Because he's the cheesy Star Trek.
[00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:11.372]  It's like the Kobayashi Maru.
[00:34:11.392 --> 00:34:13.433]  I saw an article where it's like there's no good choice.
[00:34:14.473 --> 00:34:19.616]  Probably the least of the... But I get the principal choice still shut the government down, but they would have blamed him.
[00:34:20.538 --> 00:34:22.178]  But now Russia vows revenge.
[00:34:22.218 --> 00:34:22.759]  The U.S.
[00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:24.459]  only understands force.
[00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:26.740]  That's a Kit Daniels article, breaking it down.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.321]  Kicking all these diplomats out, calling them spies.
[00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:33.702]  No proof saying these people got nerve gassed by Russia over in the U.K.
[00:34:35.122 --> 00:34:39.844]  Meanwhile, China flies bombers and fighters near Taiwan, threatens attacks against our ships.
[00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:40.884]  That's Reuters.
[00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:59.367]  Meanwhile, we've got the big news here being reported that even the FCC is talking about how the Communist Chinese have infiltrated the companies inside the United States that control, through one central system, all of our phones and all the phone number indexes.
[00:35:00.027 --> 00:35:01.067]  That's just one example.
[00:35:01.588 --> 00:35:02.228]  Overhaul of U.S.
[00:35:02.248 --> 00:35:05.670]  telecommunications database sparks fear of catastrophic failure.
[00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.692]  That's not a free beacon, but you've got to read all the way on page three
[00:35:12.892 --> 00:35:13.172]  I don't know.
[00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:32.346]  Pretty soon he'll be back to Hillary Clinton.
[00:35:33.147 --> 00:35:38.312]  And they're out to get him, and it's his supporters fighting hard and under attack, and the bullying and all of it.
[00:35:38.352 --> 00:35:40.494]  He needs to fire up and get more aggressive.
[00:35:40.874 --> 00:35:43.036]  He needs to be exposing election fraud in the states.
[00:35:43.617 --> 00:35:44.738]  He needs to be out there.
[00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:49.082]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are full steam ahead.
[00:35:49.722 --> 00:35:53.025]  And the more he rolls over to them, the worse they get.
[00:35:54.223 --> 00:35:57.744]  And so, again, I think Trump looks at mainstream media too much.
[00:35:57.784 --> 00:35:59.544]  I think the old Republican leadership does.
[00:36:00.105 --> 00:36:00.765]  They don't matter.
[00:36:01.245 --> 00:36:09.667]  I go out there in the country, and the young people, the Hispanic folks, the black folks, the white folks, they don't know who these senators and congressmen are.
[00:36:09.927 --> 00:36:10.687]  They know who I am.
[00:36:11.247 --> 00:36:16.569]  They know who Steven Crowder is, who's just exploding, by the way, to Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich.
[00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:18.389]  They know who Jack Posobiec is.
[00:36:18.429 --> 00:36:19.609]  They know who my son is.
[00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.230]  That's who's popular.
[00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:21.870]  I'll be sitting there
[00:36:23.553 --> 00:36:27.316]  Again, with famous people who are national TV hosts.
[00:36:27.396 --> 00:36:28.937]  No one knows who they are, they know who I am.
[00:36:29.177 --> 00:36:43.647]  And I'm not bragging, it's just Trump 71, he's dialed into mainstream news, and what Mike Cernovich said about he's obsessed with what Alec Baldwin does on stupid programs like Saturday Night Live, instead of
[00:36:44.548 --> 00:36:49.075]  When his people rally by the thousands and get physically attacked, that's the meat and potatoes.
[00:36:49.135 --> 00:36:50.016]  That's the issues.
[00:36:50.337 --> 00:36:55.284]  Instead he thinks he'll virtue signal with Melania and go, good job kids protesting for safety.
[00:36:56.095 --> 00:36:57.336]  As if he's going to neutralize it.
[00:36:57.396 --> 00:36:59.238]  No, they're calling for his head.
[00:36:59.538 --> 00:37:04.982]  They're run by savage political operatives and get programmed and get a talking point sheet on record.
[00:37:05.302 --> 00:37:07.424]  They're not going to listen to you being nice to them.
[00:37:07.965 --> 00:37:14.470]  So, Mike Cernovich, what in Hades, before we go to Jeremy, Rick and everybody else who I promise I'm going to go to, what do you think is really going on with Trump?
[00:37:16.112 --> 00:37:17.272]  Well, you nailed it.
[00:37:17.292 --> 00:37:19.173]  It isn't that Trump doesn't care.
[00:37:19.193 --> 00:37:27.455]  It's that he is still in that old media bubble and he doesn't actually know who matters and who is influential.
[00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:33.336]  There's a reason that these groups are going after you and not Fox News.
[00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:37.417]  There's a reason that they want to destroy you.
[00:37:37.437 --> 00:37:40.178]  It is, again, you and I have talked about it.
[00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:42.039]  I wrote this article.
[00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:42.821]  It bothered people.
[00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:46.069]  I was kind of like, what it's like being famous and people go, oh, you're full of yourself.
[00:37:46.089 --> 00:37:47.071]  I'm like, no, actually, I don't.
[00:37:47.151 --> 00:37:48.194]  I want to be less famous.
[00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:50.480]  I'm actually trying to keep a lower profile.
[00:37:51.147 --> 00:37:57.770]  But we're more recognizable than almost anybody that you see on the so-called news.
[00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.391]  People are talking about the Stormy Daniels ratings.
[00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:04.713]  Well, when I went on 60 Minutes, 15 million people tuned in to watch.
[00:38:05.014 --> 00:38:07.955]  The most since Michelle and Barack Obama had done their special.
[00:38:08.295 --> 00:38:13.578]  I was the biggest ratings drop 60 Minutes had had other than Barack Obama inauguration.
[00:38:13.638 --> 00:38:16.199]  And Pele lost his job after it.
[00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:22.076]  He was, well, because they realized that, and that's why they won't debate us.
[00:38:22.616 --> 00:38:25.621]  They realized that the truth is on our side.
[00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:26.962]  Look what happened to Megyn Kelly!
[00:38:27.103 --> 00:38:28.545]  She totally botched it.
[00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:30.047]  She lost that show right after the interview.
[00:38:31.155 --> 00:38:37.960]  Exactly, and Trump was obsessed with Megyn Kelly for years, even though he didn't realize she was a paper tiger.
[00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:49.409]  These people are paper tigers who frame us, and they lie to us, and if we don't let them lie about us, and we actually say, no, actually, what you're bringing up isn't true, here's what's actually really true.
[00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.652]  Oh, so, you know, you're actually bringing up- You said Hillary fell down.
[00:38:52.672 --> 00:38:53.653]  He goes, yeah, she did.
[00:38:54.744 --> 00:38:55.344]  He doesn't understand
[00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:24.048]  New media at all.
[00:39:24.908 --> 00:39:40.042]  Here's a great example that I use, which is, why has Trump given multiple exclusive interviews to the New York Times, but he's never sat down with Bill Mitchell, who, you know, you're a controversial guy, I'm a controversial guy, even though the media lies about us, like I understand.
[00:39:40.122 --> 00:39:46.307]  But Mitchell is very well spoken, looks great, right down the line, the perfect kind of guy to be in the Trump administration.
[00:39:46.327 --> 00:39:46.367]  No.
[00:39:47.967 --> 00:39:48.187]  Right.
[00:39:48.267 --> 00:39:53.992]  Trump could just give the guy an interview and completely change Bill Mitchell's business overnight.
[00:39:54.112 --> 00:39:57.254]  Bill Mitchell would get ten times bigger and that'd be nothing but good for Trump.
[00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:58.735]  Exactly.
[00:39:58.936 --> 00:40:00.477]  And Trump doesn't care about Bill Mitchell.
[00:40:00.797 --> 00:40:04.360]  Bill Mitchell's on there, you know, Trump cheerleader, leads the Trump cheerleading squad.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.340]  Trump doesn't care.
[00:40:05.601 --> 00:40:07.782]  Trump doesn't say, you know what, Bill, you're a great guy.
[00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:11.165]  I want to do an interview with you, somebody who actually likes me.
[00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:13.166]  Could you imagine Bill Mitchell as press secretary?
[00:40:13.187 --> 00:40:14.948]  I mean, he's good on every topic.
[00:40:15.934 --> 00:40:16.434]  Exactly.
[00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:20.936]  So even if that's not an administration job, there's no reason Trump can't sit down with him.
[00:40:21.477 --> 00:40:22.998]  That's new media.
[00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:24.098]  Sit down with Bill Mitchell.
[00:40:24.138 --> 00:40:26.659]  Give Bill Mitchell that one-hour exclusive interview.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.460]  But they don't want to do that.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.701]  Bannon went on 60 Minutes.
[00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:36.504]  I told Bannon, I said, Bannon, you need to try to go on the Joe Rogan podcast or Dave Rubin or something during the Don Jr.
[00:40:36.524 --> 00:40:36.704]  stuff.
[00:40:36.764 --> 00:40:39.025]  And I said, you should go on Alex Jones and do new media.
[00:40:39.085 --> 00:40:40.126]  Bannon didn't get it either.
[00:40:40.947 --> 00:40:44.894]  No, they think like you get on the establishment, you've arrived.
[00:40:44.954 --> 00:40:45.174]  No.
[00:40:45.715 --> 00:40:49.061]  The few times I get on these big things, the audience doesn't even like it.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.643]  Unless you totally overthrow the tables, like I did on Piers Morgan.
[00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:54.443]  It's a joke!
[00:40:54.743 --> 00:41:01.448]  If I go on one little Christian station in Alabama and plug my videos, I would sell a thousand copies.
[00:41:01.588 --> 00:41:03.730]  I'd go on CNN and plug it and sell none!
[00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.751]  There's zombies watching!
[00:41:05.811 --> 00:41:06.872]  It's background noise!
[00:41:07.212 --> 00:41:08.393]  It's elevator music!
[00:41:09.214 --> 00:41:10.414]  People are not listening!
[00:41:11.275 --> 00:41:19.501]  Well, yeah, and actually NBC wanted to do a big interview with me, and I told the guy, who seemed like a nice guy, I said, I go, look man, no offense, but
[00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:26.949]  I'm just bored with people coming in and trying to bring up irrelevant stuff because it doesn't move the needle for me.
[00:41:27.009 --> 00:41:31.195]  Being on NBC, for me, just doesn't move the needle at all.
[00:41:31.216 --> 00:41:33.158]  60 Minutes, I didn't sell any books, Alex.
[00:41:33.439 --> 00:41:34.340]  15 million people watched.
[00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:36.123]  I sold zero books.
[00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:37.422]  None at all.
[00:41:37.702 --> 00:41:43.266]  So I'm thinking, I went on HBO Vice, they spent 13 hours with me.
[00:41:43.286 --> 00:41:43.767]  13 hours.
[00:41:44.267 --> 00:41:58.258]  I didn't sell one book of Gorilla Mindset from that video, but when I come on your show and I talk about how Gorilla Mindset has over a thousand reviews on Amazon, and also a hundred just like that, people go, oh wow, over a thousand reviews on Amazon?
[00:41:58.618 --> 00:42:01.581]  Because we have an awake, active audience.
[00:42:01.781 --> 00:42:02.802]  It's a totally different world.
[00:42:03.422 --> 00:42:04.603]  And that's why they hate InfoWars.
[00:42:04.643 --> 00:42:05.083]  Not because of me.
[00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:08.606]  It's because of all the guests and that we're awake and we have an audience that's awake.
[00:42:08.866 --> 00:42:10.888]  That's why I keep telling the audience, you're the secret.
[00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.329]  Stop telling me how great I am.
[00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:21.737]  They see InfoWars and other outlets like ours and yours as focal points of awake people and that's what they want to shut down is that we're able to come together and realize we're not alone.
[00:42:22.628 --> 00:42:23.989]  Well, and they hate the liberals, too!
[00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.631]  They hate Dave Rubin.
[00:42:25.651 --> 00:42:28.133]  Dave Rubin's channel is constantly under attack.
[00:42:28.493 --> 00:42:33.957]  They hate Joe Rogan because Joe Rogan is talking about Seth Rich and saying, man, this is really weird.
[00:42:34.238 --> 00:42:37.100]  The problem is Joe is so popular right now.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.561]  That's why I worry about him.
[00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:40.102]  I think they might frame him for something.
[00:42:40.483 --> 00:42:45.287]  Joe's so popular that they can't go after him the way they've gone after the Rubin report.
[00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:46.748]  So Dave Rubin is a liberal.
[00:42:47.108 --> 00:42:48.430]  Jordan Peterson is a liberal.
[00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:55.219]  So even if you're a liberal, if you're waking people up and getting people to think for themselves and not be zombies, they're gonna target you.
[00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:58.403]  So it isn't even a war on conservatives per se.
[00:42:58.443 --> 00:42:59.744]  It's a war on independence.
[00:43:00.925 --> 00:43:01.825]  It's a war on independence.
[00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:02.546]  We'll be back with calls.
[00:43:03.186 --> 00:43:09.288]  InfoWars Life BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason.
[00:43:09.488 --> 00:43:13.249]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling nootropics were.
[00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:15.810]  What were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.750]  And we made it even stronger.
[00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.612]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[00:43:22.972 --> 00:43:24.932]  We only have a hundred and fifty percent.
[00:43:25.253 --> 00:43:26.413]  Then it helps fund our operation.
[00:43:26.713 --> 00:43:28.995]  Well now it's 50% off.
[00:43:29.535 --> 00:43:37.941]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about 7 days to kick in.
[00:43:37.961 --> 00:43:39.482]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.164]  But the two go together.
[00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:42.945]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[00:43:43.305 --> 00:43:47.668]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off.
[00:43:48.869 --> 00:43:52.512]  And free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:43:52.773 --> 00:43:57.597]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out.

[00:44:14.155 --> 00:44:19.339]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:22.461]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:31.427]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:44:33.548 --> 00:44:41.632]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:44:41.752 --> 00:44:52.637]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:44:53.137 --> 00:44:54.438]  It is amazing!
[00:44:55.819 --> 00:45:00.801]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.

[00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:10.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.574 --> 00:47:19.515]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:47:19.975 --> 00:47:20.456]  A lie!
[00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:22.577]  No man is obsolete!
[00:47:22.877 --> 00:47:24.698]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:47:24.738 --> 00:47:27.640]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.083]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:47:33.443 --> 00:47:35.104]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:47:35.124 --> 00:47:36.264]  A crawling insect!
[00:47:36.645 --> 00:47:40.707]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:47:41.287 --> 00:47:42.387]  I am a human being!
[00:47:42.788 --> 00:47:49.989]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.250]  I don't care!
[00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.710]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.091]  I'm a human being!
[00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:54.831]  I exist!
[00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:59.032]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:01.577]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[00:48:01.977 --> 00:48:04.718]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:48:05.138 --> 00:48:12.560]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:18.222]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[00:48:19.903 --> 00:48:23.384]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:48:23.964 --> 00:48:25.705]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:27.025 --> 00:48:32.730]  Alright, we got phones loaded with great people with great comments about the gun grabbing, about Trump on Russia, you name it.
[00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:33.890]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[00:48:33.931 --> 00:48:37.353]  Mike, you were getting to a point where we hit break, finish up with that, and then I was getting into Russia.
[00:48:38.094 --> 00:48:44.059]  How the more he expands operations against Russia, the more they say, oh look, you're just backing off, you know, to get us off your back.
[00:48:44.139 --> 00:48:45.400]  And then it's just made up.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.601]  I'm not in love with Russia.
[00:48:47.121 --> 00:48:50.704]  Communist China is so, so in control of our country at so many levels.
[00:48:51.084 --> 00:48:54.867]  I just wish Americans realized how perilous the situation was.
[00:48:54.887 --> 00:48:55.568]  So please continue.
[00:48:57.068 --> 00:49:00.472]  Yeah, Trump is not a bad person.
[00:49:00.512 --> 00:49:05.118]  The issue is he surrounded himself with really dumb advisors.
[00:49:05.198 --> 00:49:07.521]  I don't know, for example, if you saw the GOP ad.
[00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:10.745]  I don't want to single it out too much because it's a good kid, a high school kid.
[00:49:11.065 --> 00:49:14.990]  But the GOP goes, oh, this kid is going to use his tax cut to pay for college.
[00:49:15.883 --> 00:49:19.047]  And the answer is like, well, no, the college is too expensive to do that.
[00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:22.510]  And two, tax cuts aren't how you get the youth vote.
[00:49:22.911 --> 00:49:25.433]  But if you're in the GOP, that's what they think.
[00:49:25.453 --> 00:49:26.314]  Oh, tax cuts.
[00:49:26.334 --> 00:49:32.761]  They don't realize no college kids can't write Trump and chalk on the sidewalk without facing death threats.
[00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:34.122]  That's what matters to me.
[00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:35.464]  The issue is the free speech.
[00:49:35.504 --> 00:49:37.246]  The issue is the authoritarian left.
[00:49:37.567 --> 00:49:39.289]  The issue is that they're out of control.
[00:49:39.569 --> 00:49:45.657]  But the old elites are so used to living in freedom, they have no idea we've got a giant Bolsheviks infection.
[00:49:47.198 --> 00:49:52.245]  Our leg is rotting off with green pus coming out, and the Republican establishment is playing golf.
[00:49:53.444 --> 00:49:56.726]  Yeah, you wear a Trump hat on college campus, they'll kick you out of class.
[00:49:57.046 --> 00:50:03.689]  There was a student kicked out of class for claiming that there were only two genders, even though that was the topic of the discussion for debate.
[00:50:04.249 --> 00:50:06.150]  There's nothing from this from the Republicans.
[00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.371]  There's nothing from this from Trump.
[00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:13.114]  So the issue is that Trump has buffoons all around him, GOP stooges.
[00:50:13.814 --> 00:50:20.838]  His number one advisor is now a guy by the name of Johnny DeStefano, whose previous job was driving John Boehner to spray tans.
[00:50:21.498 --> 00:50:31.924]  That's who he has, that's kind of the running inside joke is, how Johnny DeStefano, whose last job was taking John Boerner to his spray tan appointments, how does that become Trump's chief advisor?
[00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:34.802]  Well, it really does say it all.
[00:50:35.042 --> 00:50:37.142]  So these people are telling Trump.
[00:50:37.563 --> 00:50:41.464]  And this is why I threw a big fit about the omnibus bill.
[00:50:41.484 --> 00:50:43.664]  People go, Cernovich, you're fair weather, you're this.
[00:50:43.684 --> 00:50:45.465]  And I go, first of all, I'm not fair weather or anything.
[00:50:45.565 --> 00:50:46.245]  I don't work for the GOP.
[00:50:46.265 --> 00:50:46.985]  I don't work for Trump.
[00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:48.246]  I work for the people.
[00:50:48.626 --> 00:50:55.488]  And my job is that when you turn into a Mike Cernovich transmission, you don't know what you're going to get because you know that I always bring the fire.
[00:50:56.135 --> 00:51:08.505]  So what I told people, though, is if you supported Trump signing the omnibus bill, Johnny DeStefano and all these other advisors are going to say, see, see, Don, you know, we told you that this was no big deal.
[00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:09.566]  Your base wouldn't care.
[00:51:09.586 --> 00:51:11.568]  And then Trump will say, oh, yeah, you guys are real smart.
[00:51:11.588 --> 00:51:12.449]  You guys are real right.
[00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:15.171]  I get more to understand that we don't stay on Trump.
[00:51:15.631 --> 00:51:17.373]  He will get influenced by the people around him.
[00:51:18.288 --> 00:51:18.829]  Exactly.
[00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:24.014]  So when we push back and then that gets on Fox News, Trump goes, well, wait a minute.
[00:51:24.034 --> 00:51:25.736]  You guys told me this was a good idea.
[00:51:25.756 --> 00:51:28.599]  You guys told me that the people weren't going to care.
[00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:29.641]  And they do care.
[00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.063]  So that's why we have to raise.
[00:51:32.123 --> 00:51:32.704]  Holy heck.
[00:51:33.436 --> 00:51:46.605]  Whenever Trump does something like the Omnibus Bill, but likewise we don't want to be negative, and when he does great things, and he's done many amazing things... Sure, all the stuff he was planning for 20 years, China, the economy, all this he's doing is that's what he believes in.
[00:51:47.046 --> 00:51:57.893]  But the problem is he only watches basically Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, as you said the New York Times, they try to keep Infowars, your material, away from him, and so that's why this is happening.
[00:51:57.913 --> 00:52:02.897]  We've come so far, I want to go to some phone calls here, but what about the Russia situation?
[00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:10.431]  I mean, that is really dangerous because there's no evidence Russian nerve gas these people and now we're just barreling towards war.
[00:52:11.877 --> 00:52:22.699]  Yeah, well, they've always wanted World War III, and it looks like we're now going to have a proxy war in Syria, and it'll be the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
[00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:28.421]  I don't know if you saw this, but there are things that you can watch that if you're woke, you know what is happening.
[00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:38.443]  So there was a bunch of news footage of Saudi anti-air strike missiles shooting so-called Iranian missiles, and then that went viral.
[00:52:38.603 --> 00:52:39.803]  And you're like, well, wait a minute.
[00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.992]  Why is that clip going viral?
[00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:48.128]  So, we'll talk about the Trump-Russian diplomats, but something important yesterday happened that all woke people noticed.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:56.066]  Is, whenever you're starting to see a new messaging, you're like, oh wait a minute, they got their talking points now from the deep state.
[00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.829]  Oh that's how, I mean, they still attack us with stuff that Podesta wrote two years ago.
[00:52:59.849 --> 00:53:03.531]  You know, gay frogs, nobody died at Newtown, all, exactly.
[00:53:03.772 --> 00:53:07.695]  So you see the new talking points coming out that Saudi Arabia's gonna help in Syria.
[00:53:08.015 --> 00:53:11.057]  Saudi Arabia's got weapons to fight Iran if Iran attacks them.
[00:53:11.437 --> 00:53:13.139]  It's the idea that Iran's getting ready to attack.
[00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:14.786]  Exactly.
[00:53:15.126 --> 00:53:19.310]  So you're now seeing these great viral videos, and I retweeted one of the videos yesterday.
[00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:23.514]  They go, the Houthi rebels and Yemen backed by Iran.
[00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:27.158]  So you're like, wait a minute, now they're doing this brilliant propaganda.
[00:53:28.058 --> 00:53:30.919]  Because they're going to propagandize us into war.
[00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:32.759]  So war is coming.
[00:53:32.779 --> 00:53:42.302]  The movie is turning dark and it's going to be, there isn't even an article, Saudi Arabia opened up planes to Israeli airspace for the first time.
[00:53:42.642 --> 00:53:45.503]  So now the Saudis and the Israelis in the United States
[00:53:45.683 --> 00:53:49.846]  And the Saudis are secretly meeting with Israel every day in Cairo.
[00:53:49.946 --> 00:53:50.487]  Exactly.
[00:53:50.907 --> 00:53:52.528]  And so they know how to put pressure on Trump.
[00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:54.130]  A lot of wild stuff behind the scenes.
[00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.150]  Getting him all confused.
[00:53:55.491 --> 00:53:56.632]  Telling him the war is coming.
[00:53:56.652 --> 00:53:57.772]  He's got to defend America.
[00:53:58.133 --> 00:53:59.153]  Get it all rolling.
[00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:02.096]  And they go, sir, this will get us out of the Russia thing.
[00:54:02.116 --> 00:54:03.056]  Even though it's not true.
[00:54:03.737 --> 00:54:06.179]  Be hard line with Russia, which is in Syria.
[00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:07.920]  And then get with Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.821]  And exactly.
[00:54:08.841 --> 00:54:09.722]  And the whole thing unfolds.
[00:54:10.779 --> 00:54:12.980]  Yeah, so we're headed towards World War III.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:21.562]  I've told people that you're crazy if you're not stocking up survival food, survival water, nascent iodine.
[00:54:21.983 --> 00:54:23.263]  I have it.
[00:54:23.323 --> 00:54:25.364]  I use the InfoWars iodine.
[00:54:25.384 --> 00:54:26.824]  People go, what supplements do you take?
[00:54:27.184 --> 00:54:34.126]  And I go, I take like 50 different supplements and I do take the iodine because we have to realize that it's coming.
[00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:35.947]  And I'm not a doomsday person.
[00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:40.901]  When people watch me, if anything, they're like, why aren't you freaking out more?
[00:54:40.941 --> 00:54:42.402]  This is a bigger deal than you make it out to be.
[00:54:42.943 --> 00:54:45.644]  But people have to have canned foods or survival foods.
[00:54:45.724 --> 00:54:50.387]  I was about to say, even mainstream news admits that the billionaires are fleeing to New Zealand.
[00:54:50.467 --> 00:54:51.967]  They built the bases years ago.
[00:54:52.328 --> 00:54:53.148]  Now they're leaving.
[00:54:53.448 --> 00:54:54.209]  That's in the news.
[00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:55.109]  The jets are leaving.
[00:54:55.149 --> 00:54:56.070]  They're saying we're gone.
[00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:57.691]  What are they thinking?
[00:54:58.751 --> 00:55:01.853]  All this travel from Argentina to Antarctica.
[00:55:02.688 --> 00:55:02.868]  Right?
[00:55:02.929 --> 00:55:04.411]  What's going on there in an article?
[00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:07.235]  There's all this travel and all of a sudden this newfound interest.
[00:55:07.675 --> 00:55:08.717]  What's going on?
[00:55:08.737 --> 00:55:14.265]  So when you watch the news, you're like, wait a minute, the news is now telling us
[00:55:14.986 --> 00:55:18.067]  That we should like Saudi Arabia, even though they sponsored 9-11.
[00:55:18.367 --> 00:55:22.049]  We just did, how big of an arms deal now with the Saudis?
[00:55:22.089 --> 00:55:22.929]  I think one billion.
[00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:25.650]  The Saudis are going to get nuclear technology.
[00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:27.551]  Oh, the Saudis like Israel now.
[00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:31.373]  They're going to let Israel, for the first time, use their airspace.
[00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:37.035]  Oh, and the Saudis are shooting down missiles by rebels in Yemeni, given to them by Iran.
[00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:41.457]  So anybody intelligence sees, the table is being set for World War III.
[00:55:43.393 --> 00:55:50.739]  Well, I gotta tell you, it's an incredible time to be alive, and we got the left and the globalists trying to shut down free speech, trying to take our Second Amendment.
[00:55:51.319 --> 00:55:55.422]  World War III, Iran vows to obliterate Israel in 25 years as Middle East tensions escalate.
[00:55:56.143 --> 00:55:57.123]  It's all insane.
[00:55:57.143 --> 00:55:58.665]  You know, I promise to go to all these calls.
[00:55:58.685 --> 00:56:08.272]  We'll go to Greg, I'll go to Jeremy, I promise, and a few others, and I'll try to go some into the next guest that's coming on to guest host with us, Gerald Cilente, always informative, but a few more minutes with Mike Cernovich.
[00:56:08.592 --> 00:56:09.193]  Just briefly,
[00:56:09.813 --> 00:56:12.474]  We've got to pray, we've got to be involved, we've got to reach out to the White House.
[00:56:12.974 --> 00:56:14.454]  You've got to call talk radio.
[00:56:14.494 --> 00:56:15.554]  You know, they hate info wars.
[00:56:15.574 --> 00:56:19.695]  If we can force a story out, the thing gets picked up by the rest of talk radio and then Fox News.
[00:56:20.216 --> 00:56:22.396]  And so get these issues out.
[00:56:22.436 --> 00:56:25.437]  However you see them, however you take what we've said, make up your own mind.
[00:56:25.457 --> 00:56:27.697]  Because we're not giving you talking points, we're just having a discussion.
[00:56:28.157 --> 00:56:38.480]  And let's raise this alarm about World War III, about a new Cold War with Christian Russia, about the police state here at home, about the attack on free speech, about the gun grabbers, about George Soros who just realized that
[00:56:40.242 --> 00:56:42.323]  Most of us can't afford a bunker to run in New Zealand.
[00:56:42.363 --> 00:56:43.023]  I know I can't.
[00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:46.564]  So please, let's pray for peace and let's pray for a greater way.
[00:56:46.844 --> 00:56:49.305]  Briefly, before we go to break, come back in a few more minutes with Mike Cernovich and calls.
[00:56:50.746 --> 00:56:54.067]  We sell products here to fund our operation and we have the great nootropic...
[00:56:54.867 --> 00:57:02.732]  Brain Force, which is about to sell out in the next few days, but I'm going ahead and doing 50% off, because more comes in in two weeks.
[00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:02.732]  $19.95.
[00:57:02.812 --> 00:57:06.415]  Other leading nootropics are like $50, $60 that are a similar formula.
[00:57:06.435 --> 00:57:07.655]  This is really high quality stuff.
[00:57:08.136 --> 00:57:10.037]  Normally at $39, it's a good deal.
[00:57:10.057 --> 00:57:11.758]  $19.95, it's unprecedented.
[00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:14.440]  Infowarrestore.com, Brain Force Plus.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.901]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:18.182]  It becomes a loss leader then.
[00:57:18.622 --> 00:57:19.523]  Cancel any time.
[00:57:20.143 --> 00:57:21.524]  And we have the real red pill.
[00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:22.385]  It's the preglanone.
[00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.666]  We'll be back in just two minutes with your phone calls.
[00:57:24.686 --> 00:57:25.107]  Stay with us.
[00:57:52.369 --> 00:57:55.811]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy.
[00:57:56.111 --> 00:58:02.854]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[00:58:03.174 --> 00:58:07.896]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[00:58:07.916 --> 00:58:08.437]  It's very simple.
[00:58:08.657 --> 00:58:10.798]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best.
[00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:13.019]  We'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:14.880]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.960]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.821]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:24.664]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line new Tropic for $19.95.
[00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:28.945]  Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average.
[00:58:29.245 --> 00:58:33.026]  We need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the Globals, the rest of it.
[00:58:33.086 --> 00:58:36.506]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:39.867]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[00:58:40.127 --> 00:58:43.528]  And I want people that haven't tried Brain Force to try it and find out why.
[00:58:43.768 --> 00:58:46.049]  It's got 6,000-plus five-star reviews.
[00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:47.049]  It's amazing.
[00:58:47.369 --> 00:58:49.970]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:58:52.478 --> 00:58:54.320]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:54.701]  Go ahead.
[00:58:55.602 --> 00:58:57.504]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:58:57.544 --> 00:59:07.876]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:59:08.057 --> 00:59:11.421]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:12.121]  Absolutely.
[00:59:34.315 --> 00:59:47.587]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:59:54.693 --> 01:00:00.578]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.937 --> 01:00:21.660]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.281]  Well, we knew it!
[01:00:35.003 --> 01:00:43.827]  Going back a month ago, we knew the Democrats were organizing select young people to go out and be anti-gun spokespersons to launch a nationwide youth movement against guns.
[01:00:44.227 --> 01:00:59.495]  We played clips earlier of movements being launched on MSNBC to have young people bully their parents into signing pledges that they will, in fact here it is right here, promise to kids, contract, that I
[01:01:00.959 --> 01:01:05.701]  We will vote for legislative leaders who support our children's safety over guns.
[01:01:06.581 --> 01:01:08.562]  But I thought it's guns protecting our children.
[01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:11.704]  I thought it was Broward County, Coward County, standing down.
[01:01:12.684 --> 01:01:13.945]  Why are you blaming gun owners?
[01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.346]  Mass shootings only kill 40-something people a year.
[01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:17.346]  It's still too many.
[01:01:17.666 --> 01:01:26.370]  But why are you hyping all this and then saying, I as a father, that protect my children with firearms, or that police officers that protect people, that somehow we're collectively to blame?
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.531]  When a jihadi runs over somebody,
[01:01:31.735 --> 01:01:32.876]  They don't say the truck's to blame.
[01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:35.998]  So now we have definitive proof that this is astroturf.
[01:01:36.558 --> 01:01:46.645]  Now we have definitive proof, funded by Soros, the Women's March, the Democratic Party, that less than 10%, even MSNBC admits, we're about to play the club, of the people at those events.
[01:01:48.615 --> 01:01:52.199]  At these anti-gun events were actually even young people.
[01:01:52.219 --> 01:01:55.503]  It was mainly the Department of Education and government workers and Democrats.
[01:01:55.743 --> 01:02:05.614]  The exact same speakers, the same crowds we saw at Linda Sorcerer and the Women's March that Soros spent $287 million on the day after Trump's inauguration.
[01:02:05.974 --> 01:02:06.595]  I was there.
[01:02:07.075 --> 01:02:09.617]  I saw hundreds of buses just on the streets I was.
[01:02:09.817 --> 01:02:12.919]  And we didn't block them from marching to the mall the day before.
[01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:13.880]  They beat us up.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.080]  They attacked women and children.
[01:02:15.341 --> 01:02:16.962]  They wouldn't let people into the Trump event.
[01:02:17.382 --> 01:02:22.025]  And CNN showed the rally before the gates even opened and said no one was there to hear Trump.
[01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:24.247]  That's the weaponized evil.
[01:02:24.547 --> 01:02:27.529]  That's the globalists and CNN and MSNBC.
[01:02:28.169 --> 01:02:30.331]  So let's go to MSNBC admitting
[01:02:31.463 --> 01:02:46.082]  One more piece of evidence that this was totally synthetic astroturf, and when I pointed that out a month ago, they made a good run at banning me off YouTube, and still thousands of other channels, like the Health Ranger and others, are still banned, and thousands of gun channels are being banned.
[01:02:46.382 --> 01:02:47.523]  This is the assault.
[01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:48.505]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:53.298]  Talk about the makeup of this crowd in the protests this weekend.
[01:02:53.758 --> 01:02:54.578]  Who was there?
[01:02:54.998 --> 01:02:56.238]  How many first-timers?
[01:02:56.619 --> 01:02:59.919]  And what impact do you think it's going to have in the long run in American politics?
[01:03:00.719 --> 01:03:01.900]  Well, these are great questions, Joe.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:12.462]  I mean, first and foremost, I think it's important to note here that while young people mobilize people to participate, what's really interesting is that less than 10% of the people in the crowd were actually under the age of 18.
[01:03:13.462 --> 01:03:16.783]  So that's 90% of the people there who actually can vote today.
[01:03:17.703 --> 01:03:26.188]  Most, you know, in addition to that, I think what's really important is that it turned out over a quarter of the people who had never participated in a protest before.
[01:03:26.729 --> 01:03:31.272]  So these are people who are mobilizing around the issue, potentially.
[01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:36.695]  And finally, I think what's really interesting is that 16% of them were politically moderate.
[01:03:36.975 --> 01:03:41.518]  And that's the highest percentage of moderates that I've seen at any of these protest events since the inauguration.
[01:03:41.538 --> 01:03:42.238]  So let's stop right there.
[01:03:42.539 --> 01:03:44.520]  Yeah, they call themselves moderate because they're told.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.226]  You're moderate, you're not anti-gun, and the schools organize them, and they say, I'm going to give you all your credit for the year.
[01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:54.689]  Hogg brags that he's getting all his credits by not going to school and doing this.
[01:03:55.169 --> 01:04:01.816]  So they basically get given their diplomas if they go out, they get given their grades if they do this.
[01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:06.623]  But hiding in plain view, there is the facts.
[01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.183]  Jack Posobiec was there.
[01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:10.264]  He shot the video of just one road.
[01:04:10.604 --> 01:04:11.764]  Looks like a hundred buses.
[01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:13.405]  But I was in D.C.
[01:04:13.865 --> 01:04:16.306]  I left that Saturday after the inauguration on Friday.
[01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:23.968]  And it took us two hours to get to the airport because there were so many buses going out of town.
[01:04:24.709 --> 01:04:29.630]  And they were just, I mean, I saw hundreds of buses just on the routes where I was getting out.
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.211]  And it was a million, million and a half women.
[01:04:33.588 --> 01:04:34.989]  And they were Department of Education.
[01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:36.390]  They were wearing the stupid pink hats.
[01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:37.391]  They were there.
[01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:39.352]  And this is who they are.
[01:04:39.452 --> 01:04:40.573]  This is the government.
[01:04:40.613 --> 01:04:41.754]  This is the bureaucrats.
[01:04:42.114 --> 01:04:43.856]  These are the people that want to run this country.
[01:04:43.876 --> 01:04:44.896]  They want Cloward and Pevin.
[01:04:45.437 --> 01:04:47.278]  We'll talk with Jack Posobiec how we counter it.
[01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.460]  Is Trump starting to go sideways on us?
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.142]  The big news on China and their warships threatening blood and war.
[01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:54.543]  I forgot that part.
[01:04:54.943 --> 01:04:55.744]  Bloody battle.
[01:04:56.104 --> 01:04:57.125]  The Chinese dictator.
[01:04:58.266 --> 01:04:59.146]  Xi Jinping.
[01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:00.447]  It's all coming up.
[01:05:00.467 --> 01:05:00.948]  Stay with us.
[01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:08.819]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:05:08.879 --> 01:05:10.320]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:10.721]  Go ahead.
[01:05:10.841 --> 01:05:11.121]  Yes.
[01:05:11.561 --> 01:05:12.282]  Hi, Alex.
[01:05:12.382 --> 01:05:18.587]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:22.770]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:24.452]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:05:24.832 --> 01:05:31.518]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:34.460]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:40.044]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:05:40.084 --> 01:05:47.909]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:05:47.929 --> 01:05:53.753]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:05:53.893 --> 01:05:59.197]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:05:59.297 --> 01:06:02.299]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:06:15.741 --> 01:06:16.422]  Big Brother.
[01:06:16.822 --> 01:06:18.123]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:18.663 --> 01:06:19.804]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:20.545 --> 01:06:22.026]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:23.407]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:23.928 --> 01:06:28.651]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.402 --> 01:06:41.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Posobiec joins us for the hour.
[01:06:41.785 --> 01:06:44.387]  I intend to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.668]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:46.049 --> 01:06:54.015]  Jack Posobiec, of course, has led Citizens4Trump.com, one of the top three biggest citizen Trump organizations out there.
[01:06:54.496 --> 01:06:56.938]  He also got outed as being a naval intelligence.
[01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:57.919]  Not that that was a bad thing.
[01:06:58.439 --> 01:07:02.200]  Last year they said the president tweets him, but he's really in naval intelligence.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.961]  He should be kicked out of the Navy because the president likes him.
[01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:07.502]  That's how whacked out the globalists are.
[01:07:08.002 --> 01:07:09.663]  He's on Twitter at Jack Posobiec.
[01:07:10.023 --> 01:07:11.323]  He's a great investigative journalist.
[01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:16.985]  He shot video of hundreds, it's like an hour-long video of him walking down the road, hundreds of these buses.
[01:07:17.805 --> 01:07:20.806]  I mean, just every major road is just filled with them.
[01:07:21.626 --> 01:07:23.847]  BuzzFeed and others admit Soros is funding it.
[01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:26.508]  The Million Mom March, all of it is funding it.
[01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:39.011]  So I want to get his take on the Supreme Court Justice coming out, John Paul Stevens, former Justice, saying it's time to repeal the Second Amendment and have nationwide gun confiscation.
[01:07:39.252 --> 01:07:42.294]  You can read it in his editorial article in the New York Times.
[01:07:43.095 --> 01:07:46.998]  We've also got Washerman Schultz wants background checks for ammunition buyers.
[01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:49.540]  It just goes on and on.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.462]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:56.446]  Sociologists, less than 10% of the marchers for lives, participants were children.
[01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:01.913]  Trump set sights to extrajudicially ban bump stocks.
[01:08:01.973 --> 01:08:03.214]  He is really appeasing them.
[01:08:03.254 --> 01:08:04.195]  That is a huge mistake.
[01:08:05.095 --> 01:08:09.238]  So we've got all those reports on what's happening on that front.
[01:08:09.498 --> 01:08:12.579]  This is quite a time to be alive.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:23.126]  And also, if you just joined us, I should have led the broadcast with this, but the open calls to repeal the Second Amendment all over CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, everywhere.
[01:08:24.326 --> 01:08:32.392]  China sends massive Navy for South China Sea war games after President Xi Jinping vows to wage bloody battle for world domination.
[01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:39.637]  So Posobiec can specifically speak to this as he's lived in China, he's been in the Navy, he's been stationed over there, he's been in Naval Intelligence.
[01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:43.160]  Russia, China, Eclipse, US in hypersonic missiles.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.842]  Promoting fears the hill FCC wants Chinese tech out of u.s.
[01:08:47.902 --> 01:08:48.683]  Phones and routers.
[01:08:49.023 --> 01:08:53.586]  I told you about that 15 years ago, so you get next year's news today now.
[01:08:53.646 --> 01:09:05.533]  It's mainstream news from the FCC Yeah, folks Russia is not the issue other than their hypersonic Satan missile That's what we call it and the rest of it by the way if you think they really got stuff faster
[01:09:08.009 --> 01:09:10.270]  The stuff you see is US 1980s technology.
[01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:12.151]  But it doesn't matter, we can all still kill each other.
[01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:12.952]  It's stupid.
[01:09:13.312 --> 01:09:16.593]  Six countries are planning state boycotts of the 2018 World Cup.
[01:09:18.694 --> 01:09:21.116]  Child gangs fight for garbage on Venezuela streets.
[01:09:21.176 --> 01:09:22.116]  More video of that.
[01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:25.538]  You know, the heaven of socialism that Bernie Sanders wants to give us.
[01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:34.988]  That is just some of what we've got, and Obama and Hillary violated federal laws coming out in the news, with Facebook fully behind them in both campaigns.
[01:09:35.028 --> 01:09:35.429]  That's right.
[01:09:35.469 --> 01:09:37.213]  So this Cambridge Analytica thing...
[01:09:39.056 --> 01:09:47.941]  They work for everybody, but by the media going after this and telling the big secret that Facebook's a giant data mining, the Democrats are blowing up their own ship.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:50.463]  Jack Posobiec, there's a lot to cover.
[01:09:50.503 --> 01:09:54.726]  Congratulations on getting married and all the great stuff you're doing, and still doing the great work.
[01:09:54.766 --> 01:09:56.667]  I see it's so prolific as you reach millions a day.
[01:09:56.687 --> 01:10:02.130]  I know you've got a lot of exciting stuff you're going to be announcing soon we can't get into on air, but congratulations on all your great work.
[01:10:02.771 --> 01:10:06.233]  What do you want to tackle first of that palette of information I just laid out?
[01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:12.397]  Thanks Alex, I appreciate your kind words there, and my wife appreciates it as well.
[01:10:12.857 --> 01:10:18.545]  We just had the March for Our Lives here in Washington DC, that video I shot on Saturday.
[01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:23.972]  Of course, the March for Our Lives got huge coverage in the mainstream media, the press,
[01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:28.295]  But the March for Life, the pro-life march that was just held last month in D.C.
[01:10:28.315 --> 01:10:31.018]  that I also attended, was not covered in the mainstream media.
[01:10:31.358 --> 01:10:35.402]  It was covered, if they did, they gave a thimble worth of coverage to it.
[01:10:35.742 --> 01:10:37.824]  And they covered a little bit of President Trump's remarks.
[01:10:37.864 --> 01:10:41.026]  President Trump has been called the greatest pro-life president we've ever had.
[01:10:41.627 --> 01:10:42.708]  But the media didn't cover that.
[01:10:42.748 --> 01:10:44.529]  Instead, they covered this thing.
[01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:52.036]  And so we were told, you know, we were told that this was spontaneous, that it was an organic outflowing of passion and emotion.
[01:10:52.176 --> 01:10:53.237]  That was a lie.
[01:10:53.297 --> 01:10:54.197]  That was a lie.
[01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.018]  That is a lie.
[01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.640]  Yeah, as I went there, I mean, you could see the level of organization.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:06.144]  And Alex, to be quite honest, I've never seen so much organization for a private event, and I've never seen so much security as they had.
[01:11:06.184 --> 01:11:11.267]  This was presidential-level security they had there, from private security services, from D.C.
[01:11:11.327 --> 01:11:15.870]  police, and from National Guard military vehicles that were brought out onto the streets of D.C.
[01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.231]  This was something that D.C.
[01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.753]  hasn't seen this level of security since President Trump's inauguration.
[01:11:20.773 --> 01:11:21.353]  I know you saw that.
[01:11:21.493 --> 01:11:23.175]  And by the way, you were there, I was there.
[01:11:23.716 --> 01:11:26.679]  They ordered the Capitol Police, the D.C.
[01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:30.683]  Police, to stand down at most of the entrances and not let people in.
[01:11:31.044 --> 01:11:31.985]  That came out on the news.
[01:11:32.025 --> 01:11:32.706]  The police said that.
[01:11:32.766 --> 01:11:34.187]  So Trump is classy.
[01:11:34.428 --> 01:11:40.775]  He gave massive protection to this Soros march when the Democrats wouldn't give us protection.
[01:11:41.994 --> 01:11:45.678]  That's exactly right, and of course there were no issues with this march whatsoever.
[01:11:45.698 --> 01:11:50.222]  Now, one interesting thing that was going on as well is that this game they're playing with the numbers.
[01:11:50.242 --> 01:11:55.167]  They're trying to say that this was bigger, but actually the women's march was much bigger in this event.
[01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:55.968]  This only had about 200,000.
[01:11:56.008 --> 01:11:56.569]  The way they did it was
[01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:04.334]  They crammed everyone onto Pennsylvania Avenue instead of the big, wide Washington Mall, the National Mall that's right there.
[01:12:04.634 --> 01:12:12.438]  So you can still get that background shot of Capitol Hill, but the street itself, it's a DC street, it's much more narrow, so it seems like it's a lot of people.
[01:12:12.499 --> 01:12:14.740]  It was actually almost half the size of the Women's March.
[01:12:15.696 --> 01:12:17.797]  And by the way, this is something I noticed with mainstream media.
[01:12:17.837 --> 01:12:19.797]  They've only got, you know, 10 anti-gunners out.
[01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:23.438]  They get them all together and then shoot up towards the Capitol here in Austin.
[01:12:23.618 --> 01:12:24.278]  It's the same trick.
[01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:30.979]  You could tell those over-the-head shots were in streets, all crammed in at the stage like it was a rock concert.
[01:12:31.619 --> 01:12:35.240]  And again, the Capitol Police estimated 300 to 400,000, as you said.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.281]  CNN and others claimed a million.
[01:12:37.601 --> 01:12:38.121]  You were there.
[01:12:38.201 --> 01:12:38.741]  You're estimating 200,000.
[01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:42.591]  I'd say 200-250 tops.
[01:12:42.631 --> 01:12:47.335]  I mean, even that street itself, you can see that some of the lanes are blocked off from security cordons.
[01:12:47.695 --> 01:12:49.817]  Of course, they built major barricades around this whole thing.
[01:12:50.098 --> 01:12:51.519]  They built a wall, as a matter of fact.
[01:12:51.819 --> 01:12:55.462]  And you couldn't get anywhere near the stage because of the way it was all crammed in.
[01:12:55.482 --> 01:12:56.964]  So they had TVs all over the place.
[01:12:57.684 --> 01:13:03.249]  I kind of ducked out after a little while because it was clear that they weren't even allowing people to get up to the front.
[01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:04.711]  They just wanted their TV shots.
[01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:07.241]  You were there.
[01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:13.205]  I was watching on C-SPAN as they rolled loops of Ted Nugent, myself, Dana Loesch, and the crowd would chant.
[01:13:13.225 --> 01:13:14.186]  I saw that, yes.
[01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:15.607]  How bizarre was it to actually be there?
[01:13:16.828 --> 01:13:27.115]  You know, it was really weird because when they showed Dana Loesch and yourself and Ted Nugent and everybody else, you know, I saw that and I said, yeah, I don't really have a problem with anything any one of these people are saying.
[01:13:27.475 --> 01:13:30.057]  But then I realized that you could hear the crowd.
[01:13:30.097 --> 01:13:31.698]  They were being urged to boo.
[01:13:31.758 --> 01:13:33.219]  They were being urged to sort of
[01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:37.042]  Uh, see, see everyone who is pro-gun as an enemy.
[01:13:37.142 --> 01:13:39.243]  Everyone who talks about this as an enemy.
[01:13:39.263 --> 01:13:42.065]  So they were urging people to boo these videos.
[01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:46.248]  They were urging people to see, uh, see anyone as pro-Second Amendment as an enemy.
[01:13:46.268 --> 01:13:48.090]  And that's, that's essentially what was trying to come up.
[01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:49.604]  Oh, that's another thing.
[01:13:49.624 --> 01:13:50.545]  Can we queue up the sheriff?
[01:13:50.565 --> 01:13:53.567]  I went and looked at Paul Watson's article on Infowars.
[01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:55.269]  I went and looked at Steven Crowder's articles.
[01:13:55.289 --> 01:13:57.130]  I looked at stuff you tweeted that night.
[01:13:57.731 --> 01:14:00.873]  And it looked like about a third of the signs said, we're going to ban all the guns.
[01:14:01.434 --> 01:14:03.856]  We're going to kill you if you don't turn your guns in.
[01:14:04.276 --> 01:14:06.298]  And then I heard talk like that from the speakers.
[01:14:06.678 --> 01:14:07.679]  I saw other people's.
[01:14:07.759 --> 01:14:11.802]  This is a new theme where they're not denying they want to ban the Second Amendment.
[01:14:12.503 --> 01:14:15.726]  What do you make of this calls to ban it and calls for violence?
[01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:30.173]  Well you know what's interesting is that you know I've talked to so many people in law enforcement and the military about this and I'd say a good sizable amount of them are saying that they would not follow that order if that was ever given in our country.
[01:14:30.573 --> 01:14:41.680]  That people need to understand there are so many police officers, so many American military members that know that they swore an oath to the Constitution and that includes the Second Amendment and if that was ever given you'd see a lot of badges
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:49.503]  Uh, in, in dustbins and trash bins, if that actually happened, they were trying to confiscate guns because they're not, they're just not going to do it.
[01:14:49.543 --> 01:14:59.308]  That being said, there may be troops, there may be police that would, of course, continue with that, with that order, would comply with that order, so you'd get this huge split kind of situation.
[01:15:00.508 --> 01:15:01.469]  Just like happened in Russia in 1917.
[01:15:01.569 --> 01:15:04.330]  I was just going to say that, yeah, exactly like Russia.
[01:15:05.546 --> 01:15:10.249]  They get the central government and they kind of cut off the food and over a couple years make us all turn everything in.
[01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:11.889]  That is a real scenario.
[01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:13.490]  They're talking about a civil war.
[01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:14.891]  We're not the ones pushing this.
[01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:23.616]  Why do you think they're suddenly going from denying they want the guns to officially saying in the New York Times, everywhere, we want to completely ban them and confiscate them?
[01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:26.992]  They're overreaching, as the left always does.
[01:15:27.032 --> 01:15:29.794]  They're overreaching and telling you for once what they truly believe.
[01:15:29.894 --> 01:15:34.077]  Usually, Obama was smart enough to say that, oh, we just want regulations.
[01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:36.559]  Then you actually saw the regulations and realized how bad it was.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.262]  Now they're coming out and specifically just saying what it is.
[01:15:40.483 --> 01:15:41.303]  They want to ban guns.
[01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:42.064]  They want to ban AR-15s.
[01:15:42.284 --> 01:15:44.466]  They want to ban what they call assault weapons.
[01:15:45.106 --> 01:15:46.207]  Well, yeah.
[01:15:46.307 --> 01:15:49.090]  Now they want to ban all the semi-autos, but now they just say ban them all!
[01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:51.943]  In fact, that's what he argues.
[01:15:52.003 --> 01:15:56.107]  John Paul Stevens says go back to only black powder that all citizens can have.
[01:15:56.127 --> 01:15:58.609]  I mean, talk about a recipe for crime and enslavement.
[01:15:58.809 --> 01:16:00.010]  We'll be back with Jack Posobiec.
[01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:02.131]  Stay with us.

[01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:10.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:41.374]  Jack Posobiec, prolific writer, researcher, investigative journalist.
[01:20:42.535 --> 01:20:45.517]  Very soon he'll be announcing a big national gig that he's going to be doing.
[01:20:45.537 --> 01:20:46.297]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:20:46.337 --> 01:20:50.039]  But tomorrow's news, or next month's news today, is our specialty.
[01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:56.843]  And we're just really excited to see the things that are happening in the media, in libertarian, nationalistic, conservative media.
[01:20:57.203 --> 01:21:05.908]  Now, I want to shift gears into an area where you've got expertise, living in China, being in the Navy, in the South China Sea, doing clandestine things that you obviously can't get into, Jack.
[01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:11.692]  With your great career in the Navy and now fighting for the Republic right here in America.
[01:21:12.153 --> 01:21:14.174]  What do you make of this headline?
[01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:18.458]  China sends massive Navy for South China Sea war games with their president.
[01:21:19.879 --> 01:21:24.583]  Xi Jinping vows to wage bloody battle for world domination.
[01:21:26.222 --> 01:21:30.465]  Again, that ties into FCC wants Chinese tech out of U.S.
[01:21:30.505 --> 01:21:31.386]  phones routers.
[01:21:31.726 --> 01:21:41.394]  They're able to kill our entire phone grid because they control the database, ladies and gentlemen, through this Swiss and Dutch companies that the Chinese own and control.
[01:21:41.874 --> 01:21:46.657]  Apple is now merging with Communist China officially, giving them the keys to the kingdom.
[01:21:46.697 --> 01:21:47.658]  That's mainstream news.
[01:21:48.059 --> 01:21:49.440]  Talk about a national security threat.
[01:21:50.325 --> 01:21:51.846]  Look, I'm not a Russophile.
[01:21:53.206 --> 01:21:54.186]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:59.868]  I intend to go over there sometime and meet my bosses, supposedly, but they're becoming Christian, they're becoming Nationalist.
[01:22:00.288 --> 01:22:01.909]  Hollywood hates them because they're Christian.
[01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:05.550]  And I see all the things the President's doing with no proof.
[01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.571]  I don't know.
[01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:29.854]  China has a footprint thousands of times more intense in the U.S.
[01:22:30.354 --> 01:22:31.814]  They're taking over rare earth minerals.
[01:22:31.854 --> 01:22:33.255]  They've got the huge Navy.
[01:22:33.535 --> 01:22:34.655]  They've got submarines.
[01:22:35.616 --> 01:22:39.517]  Their actual ground forces dwarf the Russians.
[01:22:40.297 --> 01:22:41.157]  They're in our business.
[01:22:41.177 --> 01:22:42.498]  They're buying up Hollywood.
[01:22:43.018 --> 01:22:44.479]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[01:22:44.579 --> 01:22:47.440]  All I'm saying is I'm all about dealing with foreign enemies.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.360]  I'm all about U.S.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:48.900]  dominance.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.241]  We're projecting the American way of life.
[01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:53.802]  But I see Russia lined up more and more with us.
[01:22:55.283 --> 01:22:58.408]  And would the Trump Nationalist Agenda show what is Trump doing?
[01:22:58.488 --> 01:22:59.609]  Virtue signaling to the left?
[01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:03.455]  Virtue signaling to neutralize Mueller and his fake investigation?
[01:23:03.515 --> 01:23:06.239]  I mean, I see this as a serious problem.
[01:23:06.279 --> 01:23:09.183]  So, A, what do you make of Trump on this front?
[01:23:10.262 --> 01:23:11.022]  I'm not mad at him.
[01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:11.542]  I trust him.
[01:23:11.562 --> 01:23:12.403]  He's doing a great job.
[01:23:12.483 --> 01:23:13.443]  Lightyear is better than Hillary.
[01:23:13.483 --> 01:23:13.943]  Thank God.
[01:23:14.163 --> 01:23:14.864]  The globalists hate him.
[01:23:14.884 --> 01:23:17.124]  But still, what is going on here?
[01:23:18.065 --> 01:23:22.286]  It isn't very Trumpian to give in to his critics and then destroy detente with Russia.
[01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:24.387]  And then what's the big enchilada with China?
[01:23:24.407 --> 01:23:24.967]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:23:26.661 --> 01:23:30.002]  Well Alex, the President is trying to walk a fine line when it comes to Russia.
[01:23:30.062 --> 01:23:42.127]  He's trying to essentially, as you've said, appease some of these critics of Russia, appease some of what's going out in terms of the Skripal situation, whether or not Skripal and his daughter are dead or not, we don't even know.
[01:23:42.607 --> 01:23:51.370]  They're trying to appease critics, they're trying to push back on the Russia collusion narrative by being a little bit more heavy-handed when it comes to Russia on the diplomatic front.
[01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:53.231]  That being said, the U.S.
[01:23:53.531 --> 01:24:07.678]  and Russia are also both involved in military operations in Syria, where they've got to fly a lot of de-confliction, they've got to make sure there are situations where we're not killing Russian soldiers, and obviously we don't want Russia, you know, attacking any of our troops that are on the ground there.
[01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:10.500]  We do have troops on the ground in Syria, even though it's not talked about a lot.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.421]  So we have to be very vigilant of that.
[01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:17.303]  And there is a lot of information and operation sharing that goes on just for that deconfliction.
[01:24:17.643 --> 01:24:26.247]  Now, at the same time, what China is doing and turning around is, while all of this is happening, Trump is trying to use China as leverage on North Korea right now.
[01:24:26.547 --> 01:24:28.267]  They know that he needs their leverage.
[01:24:28.307 --> 01:24:31.029]  That's why Kim Jong-un is in Beijing right now.
[01:24:31.049 --> 01:24:33.730]  He took the armored train up there, the same one his dad used to ride.
[01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:35.770]  And they're using all of this
[01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:42.173]  To go and lay claim, really solidify their claim to the South China Sea.
[01:24:42.213 --> 01:24:52.477]  They see it as the Chinese lake, and they've drawn lines saying essentially that all of the Pacific should be part of China, should be China's sphere of influence, and they're really laying down their markers hard.
[01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:53.097]  I think so.
[01:25:15.373 --> 01:25:20.415]  Unprecedented for China, by the way, to do this kind of exercise so far off of the Chinese coast.
[01:25:20.475 --> 01:25:26.077]  And normally, you know, we used to joke that the Chinese Navy was a brown water navy because they stayed so close to the coast.
[01:25:26.357 --> 01:25:31.719]  Well, this is the first time that China is getting into the blue water in such a major show of force like this.
[01:25:31.979 --> 01:25:34.260]  You could almost compare this in some ways.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.641]  It's not quite as big yet.
[01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:43.364]  But if you remember back to our history, the great white fleet of Teddy Roosevelt in the early part of the 19th century, just about excuse me, 20th century, just about 100 years ago.
[01:25:44.324 --> 01:25:47.508]  That was really showing the US's dominance around the world.
[01:26:03.064 --> 01:26:04.626]  Central Atlantic, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:09.951]  And China now sees itself modeling that in a major breakout into the world.
[01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:13.315]  But unlike the U.S., we just declared we had navigation rights.
[01:26:13.695 --> 01:26:18.420]  They are declaring they control not just the South China Sea, but all the way down into the Philippines.
[01:26:19.181 --> 01:26:21.764]  We haven't seen this since the Japanese did this in World War II.
[01:26:23.294 --> 01:26:24.114]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:24.154 --> 01:26:41.679]  In fact, a lot of this territory is the same territory where World War II was fought, all the way from Iwo Jima, from Okinawa, which is very close to this area, to Taiwan, which of course is still under a major part of conflict between the two countries, and all the way down to the Philippines, which the U.S.
[01:26:41.719 --> 01:26:44.200]  took in the Spanish-American War of 1898.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:51.904]  Now it's coming back to that's exactly right next to where the Philippines had had their territorial claims.
[01:26:51.924 --> 01:26:52.324]  That's right.
[01:26:52.384 --> 01:26:56.867]  And the Chinese are studying that and their war planners are admitting they're preparing for war.
[01:26:56.887 --> 01:26:59.528]  Here's the quote by Xi Jinping, the dictator.
[01:27:00.328 --> 01:27:04.051]  He's ready for bloody, to wage bloody battle for world domination.
[01:27:04.151 --> 01:27:07.212]  I mean, talk about incredible rhetoric.
[01:27:07.252 --> 01:27:08.033]  What is going on there?
[01:27:09.022 --> 01:27:15.924]  The last time that China got involved in this area, they had a skirmish with the Vietnamese in the 1970s over some of these islands.
[01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:24.607]  And they won, but they had a very bloody time of it because they had trouble getting their supplies out to sea there for these island battles.
[01:27:24.627 --> 01:27:30.989]  So what they're using now with these islands that they've created, these artificial islands, are going to be outposts, coaling stations, supply stations.
[01:27:31.449 --> 01:27:31.769]  Let's be clear.
[01:27:47.961 --> 01:27:52.105]  And let's be clear, our Navy's bragged that they only had a brown water Navy, now they have a blue water Navy.
[01:27:52.325 --> 01:27:57.410]  They've got a blue water Navy in their merchant fleet, which is Chinese intelligence, as you know.
[01:27:57.751 --> 01:28:03.636]  And they're more projected than we are, globally, into every sector of the planet.
[01:28:03.897 --> 01:28:04.137]  Go ahead.
[01:28:05.194 --> 01:28:06.035]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:28:06.055 --> 01:28:14.065]  And this is something that we see with North Korea as well, that these civilian ships will be used for intelligence collection and occasionally with special forces.
[01:28:14.326 --> 01:28:20.173]  In China, they're referred to sort of as the little green men, basically irregulars or un-uniformed members.
[01:28:20.473 --> 01:28:20.733]  We're good.
[01:28:39.151 --> 01:28:43.135]  Now they're going in and buying off all the local governments in Africa, Latin America, Asia.
[01:28:43.555 --> 01:28:45.097]  And now they're building artificial islands.
[01:28:45.157 --> 01:28:51.563]  Now they're preparing all sorts of low-cost attack drones to take on our larger ships.
[01:28:51.663 --> 01:28:54.786]  I mean, China is in a stand-up military mode.
[01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:59.851]  And thank God Trump's standing against them because previously Hillary was on their payroll.
[01:29:00.071 --> 01:29:00.471]  Stay with us.
[01:29:00.491 --> 01:29:00.892]  We'll be back.
[01:29:13.737 --> 01:29:22.787]  We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him, and the free system that allowed it to happen in American history.
[01:29:23.287 --> 01:29:32.177]  From the highest levels of government to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us.
[01:29:32.737 --> 01:29:37.661]  But the ultimate insult is that they think we're so stupid that we'll let them get away with it.
[01:29:38.141 --> 01:29:54.474]  These saboteurs, slashing away with their leaks and sneers, their phony accusations and gagging sanctimony, drive their daggers through the heart of our future, poisoning our belief that honest custody of our institutions will ever again be possible.
[01:29:55.094 --> 01:29:59.118]  So they can then build their utopia from the ashes of what they burned down.
[01:29:59.818 --> 01:30:00.018]  No.
[01:30:00.579 --> 01:30:06.203]  Their fate will be failure, and they will perish in the political flames of their own fires.
[01:30:07.144 --> 01:30:13.249]  We are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedom's safest place.
[01:30:13.289 --> 01:30:15.951]  You know, I just heard that National Rifle Association ad.
[01:30:17.152 --> 01:30:20.993]  Airing on the radio side, TV side.
[01:30:21.013 --> 01:30:23.994]  We had a video ad going with Dana Lash.
[01:30:24.014 --> 01:30:25.195]  I always call her Losh.
[01:30:25.995 --> 01:30:26.955]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[01:30:27.115 --> 01:30:27.695]  Dana Lash.
[01:30:27.715 --> 01:30:29.656]  Great, smart, syndicated radio host.
[01:30:30.556 --> 01:30:31.016]  Great lady.
[01:30:31.557 --> 01:30:38.059]  Very successful spokesperson for the NRA that the left wants to basically kill and says is a witch and burn her, literally.
[01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:43.660]  They heard that ad running and Media Matters wrote stories about it.
[01:30:44.381 --> 01:30:45.521]  George Soros' outfit.
[01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:51.042]  Saying, oh look, the National Rifle Association is spending money with Alex Jones.
[01:30:51.122 --> 01:30:56.724]  Like, they're the arbiter, they're the boss, they're the god, and ooh, if they say it's bad, it's bad.
[01:30:57.364 --> 01:30:58.365]  No, morons.
[01:30:59.125 --> 01:31:00.105]  I like that ad.
[01:31:01.165 --> 01:31:05.207]  So, I have part of the radio ads on the network, so I run that ad.
[01:31:05.527 --> 01:31:07.547]  Even though one of those ads is about $1,000 a minute, I run it.
[01:31:11.207 --> 01:31:12.167]  And eat $1,000 every time.
[01:31:12.727 --> 01:31:13.588]  Comprende?
[01:31:14.848 --> 01:31:16.749]  I pay to air the NRA.
[01:31:17.829 --> 01:31:18.450]  Figure that out?
[01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:20.751]  So you guys don't get it, do you?
[01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:22.852]  I'm not doing this for money.
[01:31:23.512 --> 01:31:25.032]  I'm not doing this for my shelf.
[01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:29.034]  I don't sit there and calculate the work I do about me personally.
[01:31:29.394 --> 01:31:31.375]  It's about my children and the future.
[01:31:32.035 --> 01:31:32.916]  I'm a kamikaze.
[01:31:33.928 --> 01:31:35.790]  I don't care what you do to me financially.
[01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.411]  I don't care how you come after me.
[01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:38.492]  I'm committed.
[01:31:39.033 --> 01:31:42.916]  Because I know you're bad people and I want to get you off of our collective backs.
[01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:48.982]  Isn't that something you can now understand, dumbos?
[01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:05.119]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.881]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:18.889]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:25.074]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:25.094 --> 01:32:28.495]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:28.915 --> 01:32:34.737]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:32:34.957 --> 01:32:39.619]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:42.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.120]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.402]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:32:49.622 --> 01:32:51.544]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:26.221 --> 01:33:31.327]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:31.868 --> 01:33:34.191]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.667 --> 01:33:51.770]  Alright folks, I want to open the phones up specifically for Jack Posobiec on the Second Amendment attack, on the omnibus spending bill, on the Communist Chinese.
[01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:59.512]  But if you want to get hysterical, if you want to get upset, if you've studied history, like I have, it's addicting.
[01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:09.995]  The Communist Chinese, funded by Goldman Sachs and the big banks, have gone from 90% of their public being basically dirt farmers with no electricity
[01:34:12.387 --> 01:34:23.845]  To 300, 400 million people that are industrialized and a total economic takeover based on how enslaved the Chinese people are.
[01:34:24.798 --> 01:34:32.780]  And the fact that our media ignores that it's authoritarian, the fact that they ignore that they're the biggest mass murderers in history, the fact that they ignore that they're in every country in the world.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:39.882]  I mean, it was even in the Washington Post a month ago that they caught Chinese intelligence basically running UT.
[01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:42.542]  Well, yeah, you show up with $100 million.
[01:34:42.962 --> 01:34:44.403]  The Chinese don't play games, folks.
[01:34:44.423 --> 01:34:46.403]  They just start giving people million-dollar checks.
[01:34:47.363 --> 01:34:48.864]  And it's so embarrassing for UT.
[01:34:48.924 --> 01:34:50.004]  I knew about this a couple years ago.
[01:34:52.628 --> 01:34:55.709]  It's so embarrassing to UT because they got into all the DARPA stuff.
[01:34:57.369 --> 01:34:59.069]  This stuff's not really guarded, okay?
[01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:00.870]  I know what's at UT.
[01:35:01.770 --> 01:35:02.610]  I shouldn't even know.
[01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:09.332]  I was let into a DARPA area 16 years ago and I couldn't believe the guy let me in.
[01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:10.672]  I said, are you crazy?
[01:35:11.092 --> 01:35:12.232]  And he later went to MIT.
[01:35:12.512 --> 01:35:13.412]  He's one of their top people.
[01:35:14.353 --> 01:35:15.693]  And he said, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:35:15.813 --> 01:35:16.693]  They don't care.
[01:35:17.173 --> 01:35:20.574]  And I was, I was shown incredible stuff.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:24.540]  And again, the rooms weren't classified.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.701]  They had DARPA on the wall.
[01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:29.081]  It was the terminals that went to buildings outside Austin.
[01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:32.382]  And it was primate research.
[01:35:32.602 --> 01:35:36.423]  And let's just say it was like a nightmare.
[01:35:36.443 --> 01:35:37.843]  I only looked at it for a couple minutes.
[01:35:38.163 --> 01:35:41.423]  And I was just getting a late night tour of the psychology department.
[01:35:42.044 --> 01:35:44.324]  The communist Chinese were given control of that.
[01:35:45.224 --> 01:35:46.064]  In fact, type it in.
[01:35:46.424 --> 01:35:49.505]  UT caught getting Chinese government intelligence money.
[01:35:50.774 --> 01:35:55.277]  I'm just using UT as a microcosm of two miles from where we broadcast from, okay?
[01:35:56.258 --> 01:36:16.172]  That's what I'm getting at, how crazy all this is, and how they've got this giant blue water merchant navy that's really intelligence and military operatives, and they're buying everybody off, they bought up Hollywood, they're moving against everybody, and Trump is absolutely right to be standing up against them and having our ships go to the South China Sea.
[01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:17.292]  They've always gone through there.
[01:36:20.049 --> 01:36:23.291]  The last time somebody said no was the Japanese, so this is such a big deal.
[01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:27.173]  And then to see Russia being, who's being demonized.
[01:36:27.233 --> 01:36:33.196]  If the Russians were blocking the North Sea and saying we couldn't navigate through it, I'd say that's an act of war.
[01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:37.299]  If the Russians had bought up most of Hollywood, I'd be very upset.
[01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:39.060]  If the Russians were involved at UT,
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:46.027]  In the physics department, in the psychology department, which is really the department of war, I would be very upset.
[01:36:46.127 --> 01:36:47.909]  They are in our business.
[01:36:47.929 --> 01:36:52.254]  Jack Posobiec, you know, not wearing your Naval Intelligence hat, but just as a patriot and a citizen, as a reporter.
[01:36:54.016 --> 01:36:56.218]  How do we quantify how big this threat is?
[01:36:56.278 --> 01:37:02.162]  Because I'm not defending Russia, but the distraction of Russia is, for me, is a major issue.
[01:37:02.182 --> 01:37:06.905]  Because we're looking at a group that can barely get their stoplights working nationwide.
[01:37:06.945 --> 01:37:08.586]  It has major collapse issues.
[01:37:08.966 --> 01:37:10.727]  That's why Soros is on their ass, in my view.
[01:37:10.807 --> 01:37:11.808]  Give me your expert opinion.
[01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:20.574]  And I look at China, who is just leveraging their hard-working people that are slaves, and our media rolling on a red carpet, and it just makes me get angry.
[01:37:21.874 --> 01:37:25.455]  Yeah, Alex, what people don't understand is how much of U.S.
[01:37:25.515 --> 01:37:36.280]  trade and how much of world trade and just in terms of goods and products are going through the South China Sea, that are going through merchant shipping lanes through the Straits of Malacca there, that are coming up through.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:46.524]  So pretty much almost all of the world's oil is coming through a lot of these areas, so much in terms of energy, so much in terms of just our regular consumer products.
[01:37:46.884 --> 01:37:47.104]  All right.
[01:38:05.912 --> 01:38:06.853]  We're good to go.
[01:38:31.147 --> 01:38:37.551]  We live in the 21st century, but still something like 95% of goods are shipped on the on the seas.
[01:38:37.931 --> 01:38:44.075]  So any of the goods that you're getting, especially with China there, what they're how they have their economy set up isn't is a manufacturer.
[01:38:44.276 --> 01:38:46.377]  They don't have the raw material themselves.
[01:38:46.397 --> 01:38:47.277]  They don't have raw minerals.
[01:38:47.298 --> 01:38:48.678]  They don't have the raw resources.
[01:38:48.959 --> 01:38:54.342]  They purchase it from us and places like Africa, other different countries around the world.
[01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:56.744]  They manufacture it and then they ship it back out.
[01:38:57.084 --> 01:38:58.585]  So they understand
[01:38:59.025 --> 01:39:00.567]  And clearly they're gearing up!
[01:39:16.929 --> 01:39:27.899]  They're gearing up for war and saying for war, and they're the ones belligerently saying they control the South China Sea, which is a blockade of Japan and the Philippines and Taiwan and everybody else.
[01:39:27.939 --> 01:39:29.540]  I mean, we have to respond to this.
[01:39:30.081 --> 01:39:35.485]  This is just outrageously aggressive, and I think they're arrogant because the CFR said the Chinese century's coming.
[01:39:36.306 --> 01:39:37.387]  The globalists bet on this.
[01:39:37.768 --> 01:39:39.009]  Davos bets on this.
[01:39:39.329 --> 01:39:43.093]  They say that Xi Jinping is basically their globalist god.
[01:39:43.574 --> 01:39:50.201]  And so, I think it's that arrogance of the globalists that has empowered the communist Chinese to be this delusional.
[01:39:51.263 --> 01:39:56.866]  What it is, Alex, is they see the Chinese as going to be the winners regardless, one way or the other.
[01:39:56.926 --> 01:40:02.229]  They all view, the people in this sort of the Wall Street set, the New York set, they view the U.S.
[01:40:02.269 --> 01:40:03.110]  as in decline.
[01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:03.870]  They think the U.S.
[01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:08.393]  doesn't have a chance of coming back to power, coming back to dominance.
[01:40:08.453 --> 01:40:11.835]  And they're doing everything they can to make us decline.
[01:40:11.855 --> 01:40:12.595]  Sorry, you're absolutely right.
[01:40:12.616 --> 01:40:13.136]  Start over, sorry.
[01:40:13.596 --> 01:40:19.920]  Right, so they've decided to pin their hopes and pin their dreams and pin all of our economic successes.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.301]  They're putting their money in China.
[01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:22.601]  They're putting their money overseas.
[01:40:22.841 --> 01:40:23.942]  They're investing in China.
[01:40:24.042 --> 01:40:27.124]  All the foreign direct investment they're putting out is going into China.
[01:40:27.444 --> 01:40:32.367]  They're filling up the coffers of the Chinese army, the Chinese military, which gets so much of this money.
[01:40:32.587 --> 01:40:33.147]  And they know it.
[01:40:33.187 --> 01:40:40.572]  They know exactly what they're doing because they've decided that America should be on the decline, that China is the future, and they want to be in bed with these leaders.
[01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:48.295]  You know, I jumped in there because as an American I get so upset, but it's not just about an ego, like they're a football team, we're a football team.
[01:40:48.615 --> 01:40:50.015]  They sell Christians organs.
[01:40:50.056 --> 01:40:51.096]  They sell Buddhist organs.
[01:40:51.476 --> 01:40:53.037]  Mao killed 80 plus million people.
[01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.638]  They've killed tens of millions since.
[01:40:54.898 --> 01:41:07.805]  They now have a dictator in Xi Jinping, and our media defends it, and it just shows how authoritarian they are when they have these kids marches over 16 dead, trying to take our rights, and you know the communist Chinese are on record, Jack.
[01:41:08.988 --> 01:41:09.849]  Funding Hollywood.
[01:41:09.929 --> 01:41:10.889]  Funding liberal media.
[01:41:10.949 --> 01:41:11.950]  Funding universities.
[01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:17.734]  Literally pushing this anti-America agenda to make sure with regulations and control.
[01:41:39.308 --> 01:41:40.729]  Now what you just said is so critical.
[01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:59.481]  You're a naval officer, a patriot, a successful guy in the free market of ideas, one of the biggest Trump organizations out there, and you're laying out what is known fact in the Pentagon, what is known fact in Hollywood, the globalist Lloyd Blankfein bragged a few months ago and said you'll never build America's infrastructure, you're done, it's over, China's the future.
[01:41:59.621 --> 01:42:00.342]  Well notice, he's out.
[01:42:01.002 --> 01:42:11.290]  Trump is literally standing up and trying to just be fair and get us some industry, some jobs, some future when everything's been decided to sell out America.
[01:42:12.091 --> 01:42:16.354]  And this is an anti-American 21st century war to de-industrialize us.
[01:42:16.514 --> 01:42:17.495]  It's a fact!
[01:42:17.955 --> 01:42:28.944]  And it's being orchestrated and funded by the Communist Chinese at the universities with literal Mao youth brigades as the model to intimidate us into submission.
[01:42:29.224 --> 01:42:33.746]  How could all Americans not join Trump and us to say no to this, Jack?
[01:42:35.007 --> 01:42:42.270]  Yeah, you know, I've actually talked to some folks over in Europe, people that, family members of mine and friends in Poland, that said, don't give up your rights.
[01:42:42.650 --> 01:42:43.190]  Don't do it.
[01:42:43.611 --> 01:42:44.711]  This is what they make you do.
[01:42:44.751 --> 01:42:47.812]  They make you think it's smart, but don't give up your rights.
[01:42:48.133 --> 01:42:49.193]  Never give up your rights.
[01:42:49.513 --> 01:42:50.774]  Jack, you just hit it.
[01:42:51.554 --> 01:42:56.460]  Why is Eastern Europe, the most on fire sector of the world, awake to what's happening?
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.361]  We'll talk about that.
[01:42:57.721 --> 01:43:00.264]  Poland, Hungary, they get it, they understand it.
[01:43:00.564 --> 01:43:01.866]  What's happening in the East?
[01:43:01.946 --> 01:43:02.446]  We'll be back.
[01:43:02.767 --> 01:43:04.188]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:05.710]  You can't survive without it.
[01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:06.831]  But where do you get it?

[01:45:05.961 --> 01:45:12.724]  We went out and looked at what the top nootropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.

[01:45:22.969 --> 01:45:24.730]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60.

[01:46:02.213 --> 01:46:04.995]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:46:05.635 --> 01:46:09.177]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:46:09.597 --> 01:46:12.539]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:46:12.939 --> 01:46:14.920]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.903]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:46:20.203 --> 01:46:22.284]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:46:22.544 --> 01:46:28.948]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:29.568 --> 01:46:36.796]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:37.757 --> 01:46:42.422]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:46:42.822 --> 01:46:49.809]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:54.915]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[01:47:22.578 --> 01:47:24.980]  You know, I said I'd go to calls, but our guest is leaving us here.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.803]  I'm gonna open the phones up for Ben Garrison coming up.
[01:47:29.163 --> 01:47:30.203]  He likes to take phone calls.
[01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:32.365]  Maybe we'll take a few here with Jack Passovec.
[01:47:32.385 --> 01:47:33.526]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:47:33.546 --> 01:47:33.766]  877-789-Alex.
[01:47:33.786 --> 01:47:34.706]  First-time callers, again, 877-789-2539.
[01:47:34.726 --> 01:47:37.068]  I promise, yesterday I ended the show with like 15 callers on hold.
[01:47:37.088 --> 01:47:39.249]  I will get to all your calls, at least those that call in right now.
[01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:52.017]  Look, I'm going to go back to Jack Posobiec here in just a moment.
[01:47:52.557 --> 01:47:53.437]  I'm going to lay it out to you.
[01:47:55.017 --> 01:47:56.117]  I've studied the Renaissance.
[01:47:56.257 --> 01:47:57.698]  I've studied Western Civilization.
[01:47:58.158 --> 01:47:59.078]  I've studied China.
[01:47:59.618 --> 01:48:00.458]  I've studied Japan.
[01:48:00.558 --> 01:48:01.739]  I've studied Latin America.
[01:48:01.759 --> 01:48:02.479]  I've studied it all.
[01:48:02.939 --> 01:48:04.099]  Not because I was a bookworm.
[01:48:04.199 --> 01:48:08.080]  It was so incredibly interesting when I was 10 years old and started reading history books.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.060]  I've read thousands of history books.
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.801]  I haven't read one in a couple of years.
[01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:12.461]  I'm too busy now.
[01:48:12.981 --> 01:48:15.001]  But I've got my world database.
[01:48:15.521 --> 01:48:18.122]  And when you know history, that's why Posobiec is so smart.
[01:48:19.298 --> 01:48:23.440]  He immediately started saying the Communist Chinese are modeling after U.S.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:26.421]  expansion, after William McKinley and the Spanish-American War.
[01:48:26.961 --> 01:48:32.943]  Now, that's actually what the Naval War College and all of them actually understand and what the Chinese War College has said.
[01:48:33.263 --> 01:48:35.944]  So he's not telling you something classified, but that's actually the thinking.
[01:48:36.925 --> 01:48:37.885]  This is going on.
[01:48:39.066 --> 01:48:42.667]  The decision has been made that China is the model for global domination.
[01:48:45.177 --> 01:48:49.501]  If China was free market and China treated people with respect, I don't care.
[01:48:50.762 --> 01:48:52.764]  The left has made America go into decline.
[01:48:53.005 --> 01:48:55.507]  They're using leftist controls to make us sabotage.
[01:48:55.827 --> 01:48:57.669]  China has zero taxes on the elite.
[01:48:58.049 --> 01:49:00.872]  China has it all set up so we can't compete.
[01:49:00.972 --> 01:49:02.574]  That's how evil the left is.
[01:49:02.674 --> 01:49:04.696]  They are out to destroy the country.
[01:49:04.956 --> 01:49:09.981]  They want your guns, they want your churches, they want your life, they want to break you, they want to dominate you.
[01:49:11.738 --> 01:49:14.700]  And the decision has been made by the big banks in Hollywood to do this.
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:18.383]  That's why this is such a war and why it's so critical.
[01:49:19.764 --> 01:49:21.325]  And that's why things are so serious.
[01:49:21.365 --> 01:49:22.466]  But I want to get into Eastern Europe.
[01:49:23.106 --> 01:49:24.407]  Article came out this weekend.
[01:49:24.687 --> 01:49:29.210]  The head of the Hungarian parliament came out and laid out they want to end our families.
[01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:30.351]  They're erasing all culture.
[01:49:30.631 --> 01:49:31.212]  They're the enemy.
[01:49:31.252 --> 01:49:31.852]  We must stop it.
[01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.013]  Why does Eastern Europe get it?
[01:49:33.193 --> 01:49:34.414]  We'll talk to Jack Posobiec in a moment.
[01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:36.656]  But first, we are running.
[01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:43.673]  A special 50% off on Brain Force, which is the ultimate nootropic out there for the price.
[01:49:44.193 --> 01:49:47.514]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $50 to $80.
[01:49:47.554 --> 01:49:48.515]  They're not even as strong.
[01:49:48.755 --> 01:49:49.795]  They're not even as organic.
[01:49:50.976 --> 01:49:58.258]  Brain Force, ladies and gentlemen, all said and done, cost us over $10 a bottle.
[01:49:58.898 --> 01:50:00.659]  At $19.95, that's insane.
[01:50:00.939 --> 01:50:03.640]  The average supplement has a seven-time markup.
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:05.381]  It's a great deal at $35.
[01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:08.971]  It's 50% off right now.
[01:50:08.992 --> 01:50:08.971]  $19.95.
[01:50:09.552 --> 01:50:11.173]  See how great it is.
[01:50:11.714 --> 01:50:12.995]  Natural, healthy pickup.
[01:50:13.495 --> 01:50:14.236]  The key elements.
[01:50:14.556 --> 01:50:15.917]  Some of the stuff's prescription in Europe.
[01:50:16.318 --> 01:50:17.579]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:17.699 --> 01:50:18.820]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.223]  We have a special running with the real red pill.
[01:50:22.603 --> 01:50:23.364]  That takes a week.
[01:50:23.604 --> 01:50:24.645]  It's a 7-day challenge.
[01:50:25.646 --> 01:50:26.927]  Brain Force kicks in in 30 minutes.
[01:50:28.456 --> 01:50:34.981]  But we have the BrainForce Plus Real Red Pill Mind and Body Challenge Pack, 50% off, in store for a limited time.
[01:50:35.301 --> 01:50:46.029]  We're giving you a powerful combo pack to help you boost your body, your mind, to the limits healthily with BrainForce Plus and the Real Red Pill with the Mind and Body Challenge.
[01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:52.994]  The combo pack features BrainForce Plus and the Real Red Pill together for an impressive 50% off savings, and I should add, free shipping.
[01:50:53.014 --> 01:50:54.696]  You can get them both 50% off by themselves.
[01:50:54.956 --> 01:50:56.077]  Get free shipping when you get them together.
[01:50:57.244 --> 01:51:09.217]  With Brain Force Plus supporting supercharging your state of mind, and the Red Pill supporting healthy aging and cognitive function, these formulas together can help you push your mind and body to the next level.
[01:51:09.958 --> 01:51:12.480]  Together, these products have an average of 4.7 out of 5 star rating.
[01:51:18.373 --> 01:51:22.376]  So again, together these products have an average of 4.7 out of 5 star rating.
[01:51:22.416 --> 01:51:27.859]  These powerful products are some of the most advanced formulas yet to help you change your mind and body.
[01:51:28.199 --> 01:51:36.825]  Get the BrainForce Plus, the real red pill, together with the Mind and Body Challenge at InfoWorksStore.com, BrainForceLife.com, 30% off and free shipping.
[01:51:36.865 --> 01:51:38.666]  We got books, t-shirts, videos.
[01:51:39.286 --> 01:51:43.531]  Radio, water filtration, all of it's just high quality products that you and your family need.
[01:51:43.791 --> 01:51:51.721]  David Hogg on C-SPAN goes, you notice Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are bad for you and that give you cancer, and then he sells you water filters.
[01:51:52.442 --> 01:51:55.345]  Hogg, you caught me in my slick deception.
[01:51:55.365 --> 01:51:55.886]  Now see, Hogg...
[01:51:57.438 --> 01:52:02.884]  Teleprompter readers, actors, Decepticons, they're always thinking of the angle or the scam.
[01:52:02.924 --> 01:52:07.129]  See, with me, it's all slamming into you straight on, straight shooting.
[01:52:07.509 --> 01:52:09.211]  That's how old-fashioned Texans do it.
[01:52:09.532 --> 01:52:09.732]  See?
[01:52:10.593 --> 01:52:12.175]  Yes, I filter my water.
[01:52:12.475 --> 01:52:14.377]  Yes, the water's full of glyphosates and poison.
[01:52:14.678 --> 01:52:16.219]  Yes, we have the very highest rated
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:18.721]  Ravity Fed Filters and other systems.
[01:52:18.741 --> 01:52:20.522]  We have six or seven of the best companies out there.
[01:52:20.542 --> 01:52:21.483]  They're all apples and oranges.
[01:52:21.503 --> 01:52:22.224]  Some are better at this.
[01:52:22.504 --> 01:52:23.044]  Some are better than that.
[01:52:23.064 --> 01:52:25.586]  But whatever the highest rated stuff is, I go become a distributor.
[01:52:25.706 --> 01:52:26.867]  I get the best sales of it.
[01:52:26.927 --> 01:52:30.189]  I get the lowest price to buy it in bulk so we can fund the operation.
[01:52:31.735 --> 01:52:37.518]  So yes, David Hogg's like, notice he says the water's got toxins, and that you should filter it, and then he sells filters.
[01:52:38.158 --> 01:52:39.079]  Oh my gosh!
[01:52:39.279 --> 01:52:40.139]  Oh my God!
[01:52:40.499 --> 01:52:41.740]  Oh, wow, you figured!
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.901]  Again, he thinks that's a scam.
[01:52:44.361 --> 01:52:46.382]  See, you can't cheat an honest man, they used to say.
[01:52:47.123 --> 01:52:51.745]  But it's always the people that are into scams and deception that see everything else as a scam.
[01:52:52.145 --> 01:52:54.226]  Yes, Hogg, we're selling water filters.
[01:52:54.607 --> 01:52:55.727]  I really believe you need them.
[01:52:55.767 --> 01:52:56.447]  The studies show it.
[01:52:56.467 --> 01:52:57.428]  All right, enough of me.
[01:52:57.448 --> 01:53:00.710]  We got this little segment and one more with Jack Posobiec, then calls coming up.
[01:53:02.037 --> 01:53:12.725]  Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Russia to a great extent, rediscovering Christian roots, rejecting Islamic invasion, rejecting Soros.
[01:53:13.926 --> 01:53:17.169]  I read the statements of the speeches of the presidents and prime ministers.
[01:53:17.249 --> 01:53:18.229]  It's like Infowars.
[01:53:18.289 --> 01:53:22.793]  It's like Jack Posobiec, the eugenics, the end of our family, the global corporate takeover.
[01:53:23.173 --> 01:53:25.175]  What is going on in the East?
[01:53:26.311 --> 01:53:35.833]  Well, Alex, in Eastern Europe, they've been through this so many times before with different invasions, whether it be from the Ottoman Turks, whether it be from the Huns in Central Asia that have come through.
[01:53:36.193 --> 01:53:46.436]  They've fought for their civilization, they've fought for their culture so many times, and they just got over the communist, essentially Soviet, occupation of Eastern Europe with the Warsaw Pact.
[01:53:46.696 --> 01:54:03.193]  They're still digging out from under that and that's why they understand and are so sensitive to any of these takeover attempts, any of these foreign ideologies that are being pushed on top of them by these people that are going after, they're trying to change this and they're trying to stop anyone who speaks out against it.
[01:54:03.213 --> 01:54:05.395]  They're trying to shut anyone down who is a whistleblower.
[01:54:05.435 --> 01:54:06.296]  We now know, of course,
[01:54:07.256 --> 01:54:13.498]  One piece of information that my sources are telling me, Alex, is you mentioned Cambridge Analytica earlier and the investigation.
[01:54:13.578 --> 01:54:22.041]  What I've heard is that actually they're trying to tie that back to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and his activity that had gone on during the election.
[01:54:22.081 --> 01:54:29.944]  They're trying to tie it back, say that he took stolen documents and posted them on Facebook and posted them on Twitter and that Cambridge Analytica was driving the whole thing.
[01:54:30.164 --> 01:54:33.685]  And they're trying to use this to pin down a charge on
[01:54:34.165 --> 01:54:38.990]  Assange to essentially indict him, and Mueller knows this, and Mueller is looking at this.
[01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:41.092]  This is something that MI6 really wants.
[01:54:41.132 --> 01:54:42.073]  This is something that U.S.
[01:54:42.113 --> 01:54:43.694]  secret agencies want.
[01:54:44.235 --> 01:54:47.498]  The intel agencies have wanted for a long time to get Assange under something.
[01:54:47.758 --> 01:54:54.485]  They're trying to pin this all on Assange to shut him up, to shut down WikiLeaks, because they don't want anyone essentially.
[01:54:54.525 --> 01:54:55.946]  And what was their crime, right?
[01:54:56.207 --> 01:54:58.529]  They told you what the leaders were doing.
[01:55:01.013 --> 01:55:04.880]  Jack, you talk about the instinct in Eastern Europe to stand up against being overrun.
[01:55:05.881 --> 01:55:11.290]  How do we reach out to the average leftist that's brainwashed so they understand you are being enslaved.
[01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:12.312]  You are a chump.
[01:55:12.693 --> 01:55:14.356]  You are buying Soros propaganda.
[01:55:16.087 --> 01:55:21.350]  You know, one thing I like to do is to say, why is it that all of these celebrities agree with you?
[01:55:21.431 --> 01:55:34.839]  Why is it that when everyone in power, everyone in the mainstream media agrees with every single one of the talking points that you're saying, are you really being rebellious when you've got this entire establishment that's echoing the exact same talking points and phrases that you are?
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:44.666]  And I've noticed that with some of them, with the ones that are at least willing to have some of that introspection, they will actually kind of consider that and say, you know, that's weird, I didn't think about it that way.
[01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:49.291]  And again, less than 10% MSNBC admits were actually under the age of 18.
[01:55:49.491 --> 01:55:52.613]  This is giant, ridiculous astroturf.
[01:55:53.073 --> 01:55:54.253]  And I go back to that question.
[01:55:54.874 --> 01:55:56.154]  Trump on the omnibus bill.
[01:55:56.174 --> 01:56:00.156]  You know, giving lip service to the gun control.
[01:56:01.037 --> 01:56:02.037]  What do you think he's doing there?
[01:56:03.518 --> 01:56:05.499]  You know, I think it's appeasement, Alex.
[01:56:05.539 --> 01:56:06.880]  He's trying to appease the left.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.021]  He's trying to say that he's doing something that's bipartisan.
[01:56:10.061 --> 01:56:12.663]  I agree, but that only encourages these people.
[01:56:13.682 --> 01:56:22.412]  They said, there was one student that gave a speech at the March for Our Lives and said, if you give us an inch on bump stocks, we will take a mile.
[01:56:22.472 --> 01:56:24.394]  That was specifically what the quote was.
[01:56:26.456 --> 01:56:27.597]  Yeah, that was Delaina Tarr.
[01:56:27.678 --> 01:56:29.680]  Do we have that clip of her?
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:30.180]  Here she is.
[01:56:31.762 --> 01:56:35.106]  There are so very many things, so many steps to take.
[01:56:36.075 --> 01:56:36.715]  Like right now.
[01:56:37.515 --> 01:56:38.256]  Sign our petition.
[01:56:38.996 --> 01:56:40.836]  It takes two seconds, and it matters.
[01:56:41.336 --> 01:56:44.737]  We will take the big, and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting.
[01:56:45.397 --> 01:56:49.418]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[01:56:49.438 --> 01:56:52.619]  We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here for real change.
[01:56:53.879 --> 01:56:54.299]  And there you go.
[01:56:54.759 --> 01:56:58.560]  I mean, they just, I said that and my ears went straight up.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.461]  My antenna went straight up and said, there it is.
[01:57:00.781 --> 01:57:01.901]  That's the signal right there.
[01:57:02.984 --> 01:57:05.826]  We gotta go to break, do five more minutes with you, because I want to ask you a critical question.
[01:57:05.846 --> 01:57:09.810]  I want to ask the audience this question, and I want to ask them to think about this.
[01:57:10.791 --> 01:57:23.702]  Why, after decades of saying they don't want to confiscate the guns, they don't want to repeal the Second Amendment, why suddenly, at the march to grab your guns, at the march to enslave America, on the New York Times, former Supreme Court justices,
[01:57:25.407 --> 01:57:28.409]  Why are they suddenly admitting they want to confiscate the guns?
[01:57:28.909 --> 01:57:30.010]  Why are they now admitting it?
[01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:34.913]  Because when they finally get to the point of doing it, they've got to go from denying it to doing it.
[01:57:34.973 --> 01:57:35.433]  That's why.
[01:57:35.493 --> 01:57:36.334]  That's my answer.
[01:57:36.694 --> 01:57:38.035]  I'm going to ask Pacific what he thinks.
[01:57:39.076 --> 01:57:40.096]  Your phone call's coming up.
[01:57:40.516 --> 01:57:42.898]  Please spread the live links, however you're watching or listening.
