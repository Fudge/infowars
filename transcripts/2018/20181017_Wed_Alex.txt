[00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.951]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:26.313]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:46.031]  20 days.
[00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:56.106]  Twenty days, and the tidal wave of total censorship has gone into insane overdrive.
[00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:59.087]  Unbelievable information coming up.
[00:00:59.087 --> 00:01:14.312]  Facebook, Twitter, you name it, are banning tens of thousands of pages of anyone that promotes the MPC memes, which simply takes a grey face and puts it over the face of conformist, authoritarian, leftist thinkers.
[00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:25.207]  In PHX1138, it's really a remake of the idea of a brave new world, a scientific dictatorship.
[00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:27.928]  They resemble MPC memes.
[00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:34.971]  In the famous 10 Minutes of Hate from 1984, they wear grey uniforms and most people have shaved heads to be conformist.
[00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:39.573]  I mean, in every archetype, this is the image that's used of cults.
[00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:47.501]  Of controlled populations, of prisoners, of brainwashing, of POWs.
[00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.742]  And now they're trying to ban it everywhere.
[00:01:50.742 --> 00:02:02.186]  In 1984, Apple had a Super Bowl ad that is still regarded at major universities and in ad schools as the most popular and famous television ad of all time.
[00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:18.515]  And it shows faceless people that look exactly like MPC memes, gray skin, gray uniforms, all subserviently chanting the same mindless garbage.
[00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:29.445]  And today, would Twitter ban the 1984 Apple computer ad with the image of the goddess?
[00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:42.032]  Alive with her blonde hair and her red shorts and her white shirt and her full breast, bringing life back to the internet, bringing life to the PC tyranny!
[00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:45.295]  But now, you have the Apple tyranny.
[00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:46.656]  You have the Google tyranny.
[00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:49.578]  And they have become what they claim they were fighting.
[00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:53.241]  Oh, then they were revolutionaries in 1984.
[00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.403]  Steve Jobs saw the parallel of the authoritarian in 1984.
[00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.755]  And the 10 minutes of hate, and the PC dictatorship of international business machines, and Bill Gates.
[00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.157]  And he came, and he smashed it.
[00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.299]  Only to become something far worse than he'd said.
[00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.103]  But if you look at the MPC memes, if you're a radio listener, TV listener, haven't seen them, they're up on Infowars.com.
[00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:16.445]  It's something very telling.
[00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:22.470]  They've gone from just a few months ago denying that they were censoring conservatives and libertarians in anything successful, anything viral,
[00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:27.007]  By calling it Nazi, or calling it homophobic.
[00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.369]  They never even show what it was they said was homophobic.
[00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.130]  As if you don't have free speech to be homophobic.
[00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.012]  But they would lie and say you were when you weren't.
[00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:37.275]  New York Times admits memes are tools of influence.
[00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.377]  As Twitter drops... Banhammer.
[00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:42.298]  And then it shows the New York Times screenshot.
[00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:43.399]  What is an NPC?
[00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.301]  The pro-Trump internet new favorite insult.
[00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.743]  Twitter has barred hundreds of right-wing accounts.
[00:03:48.743 --> 00:03:49.383]  It's thousands now.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.964]  Posting soulless, non-playable, liberal activities.
[00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:16.583]  So if you make fun of the tyranny of the censors, the tyranny of the colleges, the tyranny of the thought police, which is completely admitted, the New York Times says, we're banning you, and they praise Twitter and others for banning people's accounts, because they simply post joke memes, calling it dehumanization.
[00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:18.673]  Isn't that total inversion?
[00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:19.874]  Isn't that rich?
[00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:24.796]  The NPC meme is showing the dehumanization like the book 1984.
[00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:27.198]  Or the movie 1984.
[00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:29.179]  Or the movie THX1138.
[00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:30.960]  Or the Apple commercial in 1984.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.903]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:39.425]  Think about the unbelievable irony of these authoritarians.
[00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.206]  But I'm here to tell you.
[00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:49.292]  Any symbol that people seize on to say no to tyranny is banned in China, like saying their dictator president is Winnie the Pooh.
[00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:50.394]  That's banned.
[00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:53.718]  Or, emojis of the Taiwanese flag are banned.
[00:04:53.718 --> 00:04:55.300]  Flags of Tibet are banned.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.983]  And why not ban NPCs in America?
[00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:07.807]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.132]  Yeah.
[00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:41.127]  Twenty days till the midterms, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:42.827]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:42.827 --> 00:06:47.869]  This is the most banned, most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world.
[00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:55.531]  Because we've got our finger on the pulse, and we have successfully, that means all of you, the listeners and viewers, have helped relaunch Americana.
[00:06:55.531 --> 00:07:03.353]  And you built, I built, we built, this crew built, our sponsors, our affiliates, all of you across the world built
[00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:12.855]  The launch gantry for the modern Saturn rocket that put Trump and our beachhead in the swamp into orbit.
[00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:20.478]  And from orbit, Trump can blast the enemy from the high ground and is having stunning, incredible victories.
[00:07:20.478 --> 00:07:23.539]  There is so much to cover today, it is just unbelievable.
[00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:24.479]  We have...
[00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:42.188]  Honduras and Guatemala, after being funded by the UN, openly launching massive invasion forces and opening up migration routes into the United States to countermand the fact that Trump last year pulled out of the UN treaty.
[00:07:42.188 --> 00:07:45.270]  They're still under it.
[00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:51.912]  Places like Hungary and Romania and now Austria are pulling out of the compact as well.
[00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:52.793]  So is Italy.
[00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.496]  Well, they had been thumbing their nose at Trump, but when he promised to cut the billions in U.S.
[00:07:57.496 --> 00:08:07.845]  funding this morning, within hours, Honduras and Guatemala responded to stop migrant caravan after Trump threats.
[00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:09.146]  That is the Associated Press.
[00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:20.276]  So we're talking diplomatically, politically instant response to Trump putting his foot down and saying, I notice you've got borders, but you open these corridors up at these trains
[00:08:21.778 --> 00:08:23.059]  And now Soros and the U.N.
[00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:28.661]  are paying for the train rides, just like they pay for the Zodiac boat rides, over from Libya, right into Europe.
[00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:30.042]  Same thing into the U.S.
[00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.622]  This is political warfare.
[00:08:31.622 --> 00:08:32.743]  Simply incredible.
[00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:34.304]  So you're seeing big results there.
[00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:38.506]  Trump has come out and said Federal Reserve is his biggest threat, and America's biggest threat.
[00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:39.226]  Absolutely.
[00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:43.588]  Boy, see, doing what Ron Paul built the foundation for, what we built the foundation for.
[00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:53.068]  Now Trump and they're exposing it's a run for private Federal Reserve that is countermanding the executive branch, the legislative, you name it, and doing whatever they want.
[00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:55.060]  Trying to suppress the economy.
[00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:35.381]  Oh my gosh, he's such an idiot, he's such a moron, and he can barely even get control of the traitorous federal government, but has still righted the ship.
[00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:37.622]  And now this country is respected again all over the world.
[00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:41.122]  You are a little daddy's girl, nobody.
[00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:45.683]  Given your job, you have no ratings, you and Scarborough are a joke.
[00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:49.104]  You're compromised dirtbags, you and your boyfriend.
[00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:50.424]  Meanwhile, more numbers out.
[00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:51.585]  Once Kings of TV, U.S.
[00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:53.465]  broadcast networks face a reckoning.
[00:09:54.295 --> 00:10:05.259]  They have about 10% of the viewers they had just a decade ago, and they're losing about 25% of those viewers every year, meaning they'll basically have no viewers in four years.
[00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:07.340]  Same thing for CNN, MSNBC.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.461]  You know, they're very deceptive though.
[00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:16.104]  They go, oh my gosh, Rachel Maddow was top of the ratings this week, or oh, CNN's ratings doubled this week.
[00:10:16.104 --> 00:10:17.044]  If there's a big event,
[00:10:19.462 --> 00:10:21.744]  There's a big debate, or Trump's involved.
[00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:23.727]  Yes, they have little spikes.
[00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:27.771]  But there's no listeners or viewers on a daily basis.
[00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:29.052]  It's just background noise.
[00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:30.414]  It's just, it's just chatter.
[00:10:30.414 --> 00:10:31.795]  They're falling apart.
[00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:33.958]  And that's why they want to censor everybody else.
[00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:34.799]  That's coming up as well.
[00:10:36.252 --> 00:10:56.290]  As we said last Friday and Sunday, evidence because of there being no motive, and because the media, the corporate media jumped on it, I and others were saying, looks like it could be a rogue group, false flag to derail the peace plans that Trump has, and as he prepares to put the clamps on Iran, that this is deep state operatives like John Kerry and Obama
[00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:07.398]  Who are running their own rogue, shadow State Department, admittedly, to try to derail what's happening, using networks under the Crown Prince, but not under his control.
[00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:13.602]  Just like Trump isn't in control of most of the FBI, or most of the Justice Department, or most of the CIA.
[00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:22.829]  There are loyal people there, but there are large swaths that do whatever they want, or under the command of Hillary, Obama, and other slimebags.
[00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:24.170]  They brag about this in the news, so...
[00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:26.860]  I'm not defending Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.603]  I think it's a disgusting regime overall.
[00:11:29.603 --> 00:11:43.140]  But if they shut down Al-Qaeda and ISIS and stop supporting it, and if they start cutting oil prices, which they've done to help lower oil prices, and if they come in out of the dark, I was all for Muammar Gaddafi doing that.
[00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:51.352]  He started investing all his money in the West for eight years, did whatever was needed to reverse some of his terrorist activities in the past.
[00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:52.573]  He was helping all of Africa.
[00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:54.733]  He was industrializing it.
[00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:57.974]  So Hillary and Obama set him up and killed him!
[00:11:57.974 --> 00:11:59.495]  And then bragged about it!
[00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:02.356]  And Gaddafi's way better history than the Saudis.
[00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:06.657]  All I'm saying is that we're about to have regime change in Iran.
[00:12:08.391 --> 00:12:14.916]  It's super unpopular, it's very authoritative and authoritarian, and people don't like it.
[00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:21.060]  Half the population is 28 or younger, and it would be a really good thing to have peaceful regime change over there.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.983]  And these sanctions, these real sanctions, are getting ready to do it.
[00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:36.452]  And so, you better believe, one guy dies, they're acting like 10 million died, and I'm not saying it's a good thing, whatever really happened to him, but the fact that it's all recorded, it's all surveilled, looks like a setup on both ends.
[00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:43.106]  Again, we're the first to say it, now you hear it from the President and the Saudi government.
[00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:57.175]  I'm just going off, when I see CNN, MSNBC, day one saying Saudi Arabia did it and this ends our peace deal with them and everything's over and Trump's an idiot and it's his fault, I'm like, these are known lying scumbags that I don't believe a damn word they say.
[00:12:57.175 --> 00:13:01.458]  Saudi Arabia doesn't have the motive in this, so what's really going on?
[00:13:01.458 --> 00:13:03.359]  That's called deduction, my dear Watson.
[00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:06.882]  So we're going to be breaking all that down coming up, but the first thing I want to hit
[00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:12.729]  At the bottom of the hour is the NPC memes.
[00:13:12.729 --> 00:13:14.711]  It's bigger than the NPC memes.
[00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.092]  You don't know what they are.
[00:13:16.092 --> 00:13:26.103]  It's the idea of communication and humor and people acting in concert but independently creating a wave of information warfare that is unstoppable.
[00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:38.089]  And a little message sent to YouTube last night by insiders that they, that big tech, are not all powerful like they think, and that Trump holds the keys to the internet now.
[00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:40.671]  He's taken them away from Obama and his stay-behind network.
[00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:45.373]  So we're gonna be breaking down next year's news today when we come back.
[00:13:45.373 --> 00:13:51.197]  But I'm first gonna air Paul Joseph Watson's incredible report on MPC memes and why this is so critical.
[00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:55.079]  And then I'm gonna lay out how this is a window into victory
[00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:59.981]  And why the enemy fears it so much from their psychological warfare positions.
[00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:01.342]  So that's coming up.
[00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:06.905]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, if you support us, we will survive and thrive.
[00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:10.668]  If you do not support us at this critical juncture, we will be destroyed.
[00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:13.449]  And I'm in a war with the globalists, so I expect that I'm a big boy.
[00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:23.255]  But I think you want to keep one of the main attack ships, one of the main flagships in the fight against the globalists in the ocean, in the air, on the ground, fighting.
[00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:28.765]  And so, you know, they've taken our PayPal, they've taken a bunch of other payment processors.
[00:14:28.765 --> 00:14:33.169]  We're working on some deals with payment processors that are more thick-skinned.
[00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:38.995]  But you haven't been able to order at InfoWareStore.com is hanging by a thread.
[00:14:38.995 --> 00:14:40.136]  Your order comes through, you get it.
[00:14:42.062 --> 00:14:51.747]  But if they have their victory, it'll take us a few days, hopefully, a few weeks, maximum, to be able to get all that back up and going during this critical time.
[00:14:51.747 --> 00:15:00.432]  So I've just launched our Christmas specials we had planned, that we had inventory coming in for, our Black Friday specials, and our Cyber Monday specials.
[00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:06.896]  People love to buy on the sales days, that's just the way people are, and that's why we have our sales on those days.
[00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:10.598]  I'm putting them all together now, Christmas, Black Friday, all of it,
[00:15:11.198 --> 00:15:16.720]  The next two months of sales at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.221]  And all of our products have five stars except for new products that haven't been reviewed yet.
[00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:22.602]  There's two of those today that are at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:15:22.602 --> 00:15:24.123]  I'll tell you about those later.
[00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:34.387]  But what I'm getting at here is whether it's Brain Force or whether it's X2 or whether it's the Real Red Pill Plus or whether it's Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, four to five colloidal silver and iodine, each
[00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:37.669]  All 50% off right now and free shipping.

[00:16:29.315 --> 00:16:31.196]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:03.635]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:09.520]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.024]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:17:16.024 --> 00:17:20.067]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:35.769]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:38.672]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:17:38.672 --> 00:17:42.255]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:03.829]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:05.591]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.591 --> 00:18:16.862]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:26.829]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:37.356]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.876 --> 00:18:40.498]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.219]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.219 --> 00:18:52.204]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.204 --> 00:18:54.866]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:59.569]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.249 --> 00:19:02.591]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:04.752]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:08.674]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:19:08.674 --> 00:19:20.181]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:29.287]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:35.553]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:19:35.553 --> 00:19:40.999]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:43.261]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:45.283]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.548]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:19:49.548 --> 00:19:51.590]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.894]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:57.437]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:19:57.437 --> 00:20:03.364]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[00:20:03.364 --> 00:20:06.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.469 --> 00:20:29.353]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:36.877]  So, the head of Google came out and admitted they're building a censorship search engine after the head of their operations lied to Congress a few weeks ago.
[00:20:36.877 --> 00:20:42.660]  And all over the news, they're bragging, yes, anyone putting up MPC memes are being banned.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.161]  So, censorship is here, anything successful, anything truthful is banned.
[00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.002]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[00:20:48.002 --> 00:20:48.963]  Please spread the report.
[00:20:48.963 --> 00:20:50.524]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[00:20:51.681 --> 00:20:53.401]  So what's this all about then?
[00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:55.342]  The NPC meme!
[00:20:55.342 --> 00:20:58.323]  NPCs are non-player characters in video games.
[00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:02.184]  Instead of being controlled by humans, they're controlled by artificial intelligence.
[00:21:02.184 --> 00:21:12.647]  Their actions are all predetermined by their coding, making them appear robot-like, formulaic, repeating the same movements and saying the same things over and over again.
[00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:16.828]  Walking cliches just unconsciously repeating the same glib mantras.
[00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:18.108]  Now who could that be?
[00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:20.574]  Possibly remind you of...
[00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:49.270]  Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.
[00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.451]  Refugees welcome.
[00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:53.271]  But the left has struck back.
[00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:57.512]  They say the NPC meme is dehumanizing.
[00:21:57.512 --> 00:21:59.033]  Oh my god, so dehumanizing.
[00:21:59.033 --> 00:22:01.233]  NPC meme is dehumanizing.
[00:22:01.233 --> 00:22:02.994]  We are all unique and special.
[00:22:02.994 --> 00:22:08.315]  Remember, these are some of the same people who call anyone to the right of Joseph Stalin a Nazi.
[00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:11.676]  Oh, but now you care about people being dehumanized.
[00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:13.811]  Cry me a f***ing river!
[00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:19.678]  Anyone unironically using the term NPC in reference to anything other than video games is automatically a Nazi in my book!
[00:22:19.678 --> 00:22:26.966]  When we're not being demonized as the New Fourth Reich, we're being belittled and dismissed as Russian bots!
[00:22:26.966 --> 00:22:29.910]  NPC is a fascist term to dehumanize us!
[00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.612]  Everyone right and centre is a Russian bot!
[00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:39.799]  I assume whoever began pushing that meme was looking to further dehumanize their opposition by linking it to the in-game NPC players that are easily killed.
[00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:41.761]  Someone is pushing for a civil war!
[00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:42.782]  Russia, I assume.
[00:22:42.782 --> 00:22:43.423]  Civil war?
[00:22:43.423 --> 00:22:45.605]  What the f*** are you talking about?
[00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:46.445]  It's a meme.
[00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:48.527]  It's not the Battle of Fort Sumter.
[00:22:48.527 --> 00:22:48.988]  Stop it.
[00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:50.409]  Get some help.
[00:22:50.409 --> 00:22:58.773]  They also slapped it with the dehumanizing label to try and get it banned because Twitter recently said it would ban people for using, quote, dehumanizing language.
[00:22:58.773 --> 00:23:09.939]  So again, even in the process of denying that they're NPCs, they act like NPCs in advocating for a sterilized internet where edgy banter is verboten.
[00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:11.480]  But maybe these NPCs
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.160]  Really aren't human.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:21.883]  Maybe they're just like basic bitch social trends and banal popular culture as a default effort as a way of just trying to blend in.
[00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:26.244]  After all, what else could explain the success of the Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother?
[00:23:26.244 --> 00:23:33.287]  There's also this weird disconnect where they dismiss NPC as a pathetic playground insult not worthy of attention.
[00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:38.888]  Yet then write laborious article after article after article being triggered by it.
[00:23:38.888 --> 00:23:41.129]  The same thing they did with Soy Boys.
[00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:44.832]  What happens to kids who react to playground insults?
[00:23:44.832 --> 00:23:49.516]  They get the same insult thrown at them again and again because it obviously gets under their skin.
[00:23:49.516 --> 00:23:54.380]  Immediately stop following and retweeting anyone using an avatar like the one pictured below!
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.802]  These are 4chan trolls impersonating me!
[00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.944]  I keep seeing this garbage all over my feed tonight!
[00:23:58.944 --> 00:24:01.346]  The NPC meme gets under the left skin.
[00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:03.400]  Because it's mostly true.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.962]  The left has mainstreamed a culture of ruthless ideological intolerance.
[00:24:07.962 --> 00:24:11.104]  The left has completely rejected diversity of thought.
[00:24:11.104 --> 00:24:16.066]  When Taylor Swift tells everyone to vote Democrat, it's an admirable call to action.
[00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:20.909]  But when Kanye merely suggests that black people think about not voting Democrat,
[00:24:21.567 --> 00:24:28.793]  He's ridiculed and called insane.
[00:24:28.793 --> 00:24:33.798]  You lot literally tell husbands and wives to divorce each other if their partner isn't a democrat.
[00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:36.660]  You openly advocate the breakup of families for...
[00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:38.882]  God forbid!
[00:24:38.882 --> 00:24:40.863]  Having different opinions to each other.
[00:24:40.863 --> 00:24:46.727]  You lot reduce anyone of a certain skin color to be mandated to hold certain political opinions.
[00:24:46.727 --> 00:24:50.369]  And then if they don't, their very existence is deemed hateful.
[00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:52.830]  How is that not dehumanizing?
[00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.793]  If that's not the very essence of being an NPC, then what is?
[00:24:57.193 --> 00:24:59.974]  Is their favourite news network MSNBC?
[00:24:59.974 --> 00:25:00.895]  Or is it this one?
[00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:02.336]  Is their favourite TV show?
[00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:03.696]  Is their favourite comedian?
[00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.157]  Is their favourite politician?
[00:25:05.157 --> 00:25:07.018]  Is their favourite political commentator?
[00:25:07.018 --> 00:25:08.539]  Is their favourite celebrity?
[00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:11.220]  Hello fellow humans, I am celebrity number 2932.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.962]  I believe in everything that is safe and popular with people aged 18 to 35.
[00:25:15.962 --> 00:25:19.084]  You may now pray to me on the social media platform of your choice.
[00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:24.749]  Here's a visual representation of how Twitter works.
[00:25:24.749 --> 00:25:26.590]  Here's the Krasenstein twins.
[00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.491]  Here's their arch enemy.
[00:25:27.491 --> 00:25:27.651]  Here's...
[00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:43.440]  God only knows what this is.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.143]  And here's what happens to anyone who suggests that maybe Trump isn't the new Hitler.
[00:25:48.143 --> 00:25:49.864]  Rape is bad.
[00:25:49.864 --> 00:25:51.546]  Orange man is bad.
[00:25:51.546 --> 00:25:55.408]  I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what I'm outraged over today.
[00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:59.571]  I follow such a diverse range of people and for me this is what Twitter is all about.
[00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:03.954]  Get down to your echo chambers and start listening to unique and individual voices.
[00:26:03.954 --> 00:26:07.917]  I agree with whatever Twitter terms and view states I should agree with.
[00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:12.500]  As Evan James writes, the NPC meme is a response to something real.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.964]  Something that snarky liberals and even leftists increasingly fail to notice.
[00:26:16.964 --> 00:26:21.487]  In short, it is a tragicomic acknowledgement that things are not okay.
[00:26:21.487 --> 00:26:26.791]  That we are all NPCs, to one degree or another, because we're all in bondage.
[00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:37.716]  The MPC meme lampoons our tendency to consume the products of mass culture precisely because they are easy to process, requiring neither personal effort nor prior learning.
[00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:40.718]  Serious cultural engagement requires focus.
[00:26:40.718 --> 00:26:48.081]  It nevertheless has a rejuvenating effect, whereas the passive consumption of mass culture leaves us more innovated than before.
[00:26:48.081 --> 00:26:50.522]  And the same goes for political opinions.
[00:26:50.522 --> 00:26:56.225]  It takes a modicum of research and a small step beyond superficial thinking to understand that, no,
[00:26:56.365 --> 00:27:04.371]  Not everyone who doesn't have hashtag FBPE or a blue wave in their profile is an alt-right neo-Nazi.
[00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:13.878]  And no, Donald Trump isn't leading America into a dystopian nightmare where the planet's oceans boil over and women who have abortions are sent to concentration camps.
[00:27:13.878 --> 00:27:14.959]  You are fake news!
[00:27:14.959 --> 00:27:18.021]  Everyone freaked out over the EU planning to ban memes.
[00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:22.745]  Twitter is already banning NPC memes and the accounts of people who post them.
[00:27:22.745 --> 00:27:25.767]  Oh, you can make your avatar a Trump orange or a Cheeto.
[00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:27.988]  All day long you're not going to get banned.
[00:27:27.988 --> 00:27:31.009]  Of course we all know why the left wants to ban memes.
[00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:32.429]  Because the left can't meme.
[00:27:32.429 --> 00:27:34.970]  That's not just a cliche, they admit to it.
[00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:44.073]  A study undertaken by researchers at University College London found that the most effective memes largely originated in two places, the Donald subreddit and 4chan.
[00:27:44.073 --> 00:27:49.615]  A vice writer for the study acknowledges that the most quote effectively spread memes originated on the Donald
[00:27:50.495 --> 00:27:53.337]  That's why they want to ban the NPC meme.
[00:27:53.337 --> 00:27:55.459]  Not because it's dehumanizing.
[00:27:55.459 --> 00:27:58.300]  They dehumanize us at every available opportunity.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.223]  They want to ban it because it's effective and they have no adequate way of responding.
[00:28:03.047 --> 00:28:04.067]  Because they can't meme.
[00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:07.529]  They can't meme because memes incorporate edgy humor.
[00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:08.589]  Oh my god, so edgy.
[00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:12.991]  The left is incapable of edgy humor because they're always walking on eggshells.
[00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:16.092]  They're always terrified of offending someone.
[00:28:16.092 --> 00:28:17.732]  That's how they ruined comedy.
[00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:18.793]  Oh, this meme's dead now.
[00:28:18.793 --> 00:28:19.633]  You talked about it.
[00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:21.594]  You kill more memes than PewDiePie.
[00:28:21.594 --> 00:28:22.234]  Shut up!
[00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:26.915]  As I've explained before, with facts and evidence, I don't kill memes.
[00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:28.376]  I send them into space.
[00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:30.517]  I'm the Space X of memes.
[00:28:30.517 --> 00:28:31.277]  Give people more credit.
[00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:36.583]  I've killed fewer memes than the amount of Native American DNA in Elizabeth Warren's blood.
[00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:42.089]  So yes, the NPC meme is funny and effective because it's mostly true.
[00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:43.771]  That's why they hate it.
[00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:51.040]  That's why with the midterms just a few weeks away, and with the walkaway movement growing, the NPC meme freaks them out.

[00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:08.597]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:08.597 --> 00:31:10.079]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:14.782]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.782 --> 00:31:19.786]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:40.155]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:31:40.655 --> 00:31:44.656]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:48.337]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[00:31:48.337 --> 00:31:53.318]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:56.059]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[00:31:56.059 --> 00:32:00.120]  Supermail Vitality from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.041]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:14.065]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.046]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.507]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:32:19.507 --> 00:32:22.128]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:32:22.128 --> 00:32:24.409]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:31.352]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:41.695]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:32:41.695 --> 00:32:42.876]  We'll win.
[00:32:42.876 --> 00:32:45.797]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:52.939]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:32:52.939 --> 00:32:56.620]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.860]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.041]  We need your support.
[00:32:59.041 --> 00:32:59.601]  I'm counting on you.
[00:33:03.335 --> 00:33:05.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.603 --> 00:33:33.348]  It is only fitting that a free scream should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom.
[00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:41.071]  For in its power to deceive and inflame, or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.181]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:58.181 --> 00:34:00.501]  We're in the middle of the meme revolution.
[00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:07.223]  The European Union's passed a law to make everyone pre-approve memes or you can be sent to prison or fined.
[00:34:07.223 --> 00:34:11.825]  Mexico has a law going through their Congress to ban memes.
[00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:15.988]  That's right, because it's a new form of communication.
[00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:20.612]  The globalists want us to use emojis and things that restrict and reduce language.
[00:34:20.612 --> 00:34:24.655]  That's what the Socialist Party, Fabian Socialists in England, always called for.
[00:34:24.655 --> 00:34:29.639]  And they're kind of the managing system in the world that got adopted by the globalists.
[00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:34.504]  But they don't like memes, because computer AI can't tell what's funny and what's not.
[00:34:34.504 --> 00:34:37.006]  They're very hard to pre-censor with algorithms.
[00:34:38.727 --> 00:35:03.127]  And someone makes a funny joke and then people vote basically by sharing it and promoting it on the internet and they text it to their friends, they email it to their family, they get around the censors and then other people get involved in the creative process and they make it funnier or they make it sillier and then they promote that and then it creates a synthesis
[00:35:04.778 --> 00:35:10.382]  Of getting people involved and of creating a survival of the fittest meme.
[00:35:10.382 --> 00:35:13.303]  And it devastates the globalists.
[00:35:13.303 --> 00:35:17.486]  Who are classic conformists.
[00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:22.890]  And who, whether it be a fascist regime, or a communist regime, or a cult-run regime,
[00:35:23.985 --> 00:35:28.646]  We want everyone to dress the same, to look the same, to talk the same.
[00:35:28.646 --> 00:35:51.113]  And in the 20th century and 21st century, whether it's 1984, or Brave New World, or THX 1138, or Pink Floyd, The Wall, or Apple commercials in the 80s, people in grey, with grey faces, whose faces all look the same, who are basically featureless,
[00:35:52.631 --> 00:35:59.214]  They are the symbol of mass-produced thought.
[00:35:59.214 --> 00:36:04.557]  They are the symbol of authoritarianism that everyone recognizes.
[00:36:04.557 --> 00:36:12.721]  You come in diverse to the university, you come out nameless, faceless, in a group, with a group leader.
[00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:15.502]  You're fed into the meat grinder.
[00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:27.424]  You are rendered down and you're put into these maze-like systems of conformity.
[00:36:27.424 --> 00:36:36.388]  And so, the great geniuses over at 4chan and 8chan and all the great folks out there go, wait a minute!
[00:36:37.168 --> 00:36:45.032]  The NPC, I'm not a big video game player, but I know enough about it to know the NPC characters just aren't operating on their own.
[00:36:45.032 --> 00:36:46.232]  They're pre-programmed.
[00:36:46.232 --> 00:36:46.813]  They're stupid.
[00:36:46.813 --> 00:37:01.080]  And the symbol of the NPC, we'll put it on screen for TV viewers, is a gray face with a triangle nose and a slit for a mouth.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.281]  Well, where else have we seen that?
[00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:03.881]  We've seen that.
[00:37:06.354 --> 00:37:27.201]  In THX 1138, which again is a remake of another name of Brave New World as his college film, and then he went on to make it as his first feature film, his name's George Lucas of Star Wars and Indiana Jones and the rest of it.
[00:37:28.783 --> 00:37:33.766]  And so he's pointing out the conformity, and this is directly from THX 1138.
[00:37:33.766 --> 00:37:51.856]  A automaton, an individual that's had their individualism stripped from them, and now they're a clean slate to which the new program can be loaded onto, or erased, and then a new program put back on.
[00:37:53.737 --> 00:38:09.000]  And in the Brave New World, in the THX 1138 system that was based on real eugenics ideas in the 1920s in England, published in 1932 as fiction, later published as non-fiction in 1961, Brave New World revisited, they told you this is the real plan.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.062]  Shaved heads, grey uniforms, men and women not having sex, sexless lives, humans created in Petri dishes, in test tubes.
[00:38:21.806 --> 00:38:26.227]  And that's now where we are and that's now what's been done.
[00:38:26.227 --> 00:38:34.649]  And forced drugging with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other mind control drugs right out of the CIA, right out of MKUltra.
[00:38:34.649 --> 00:38:38.771]  Now what are the public schools, what are the colleges forcing these things on you?
[00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:45.893]  Half the population on some type of psychotropic or opiate type drug of those two classes.
[00:38:45.893 --> 00:38:50.234]  Federal government says they have a target now of 80% of children to be on these drugs by 2030.
[00:38:52.486 --> 00:38:54.686]  Roughly 30% are on psychotropics now.
[00:38:54.686 --> 00:38:55.927]  Children.
[00:38:55.927 --> 00:38:57.447]  Well, the age of 18.
[00:38:57.447 --> 00:39:00.348]  So, you keep wondering, why is this really happening?
[00:39:00.348 --> 00:39:03.288]  Oh, and what else is in THX 1138?
[00:39:03.288 --> 00:39:05.609]  Robot enforcers.
[00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.069]  Drones.
[00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:08.830]  Motorcycle cops.
[00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.130]  And what have they announced?
[00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:17.912]  Motorcycle, autonomous motorcycles in Europe that are robots driving around surveilling you.
[00:39:17.912 --> 00:39:18.952]  And in New York City,
[00:39:20.916 --> 00:39:33.442]  Autonomous robots spying on you and now they're moving to arm them including drones with hand grenade launchers.
[00:39:33.442 --> 00:39:42.446]  And THX 1138 is one big giant hive bubble city like Google's actually building these bubble cities inside cities that you opt to go into.
[00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.327]  You think you're part of the elite.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:54.044]  And then it's one big giant social conditioning center, one giant re-education camp, Hillary Clinton's fun camps.
[00:39:54.044 --> 00:39:56.926]  But where else have we seen the banned MPC meme?
[00:39:56.926 --> 00:40:04.570]  Because the New York Times relishes today that thank God Twitter and Facebook have banned hundreds of accounts, it's now thousands.
[00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.211]  If you show the MPC
[00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:17.160]  Conformity, if you project it onto Silicon Valley all meeting around a round table and agreeing to censor conservatives, and you say that's authoritarianism, you're banned!
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.442]  And the New York Times sees no irony in it saying, the MPC meme is dehumanizing.
[00:40:22.442 --> 00:40:26.223]  No, it's reminding you to have your humanity.
[00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:28.204]  It's reminding you to not go with conformity.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.863]  They'd already met with Twitter months before.
[00:40:31.863 --> 00:40:32.964]  They'd already planned to ban me.
[00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:33.985]  We had intel on that.
[00:40:33.985 --> 00:40:35.106]  I told you it was coming.
[00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:36.548]  Then I said, he'll ban me later.
[00:40:36.548 --> 00:40:39.651]  They just want to act like they're not a uniform cult.
[00:40:39.651 --> 00:40:46.358]  And then Jack Dorsey, one of the biggest proponents of censorship, can then have his cake and eat it too, and then ban me later.
[00:40:46.358 --> 00:40:48.741]  With cause, of course.
[00:40:48.741 --> 00:40:50.263]  I was rude to a reporter.
[00:40:51.834 --> 00:40:54.736]  They just say on Twitter, go kill members of the cabinet.
[00:40:54.736 --> 00:40:55.817]  That's okay.
[00:40:55.817 --> 00:40:57.298]  They just say, overthrow the president.
[00:40:57.298 --> 00:40:57.818]  That's okay.
[00:40:57.818 --> 00:40:59.899]  They just say, go out and harass people at restaurants.
[00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:00.680]  That's okay.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.721]  They just dox where people live and say, come kill them.
[00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:04.842]  That's okay.
[00:41:04.842 --> 00:41:05.563]  So here it is.
[00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:10.786]  What is the MPC, the pro-Trump Internet's new favorite insult?
[00:41:10.786 --> 00:41:17.791]  Twitter has barred hundreds of right-wing accounts for posting the soulless, non-playable
[00:41:19.448 --> 00:41:20.309]  Liberal activist.
[00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.909]  There you go.
[00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:25.612]  So see?
[00:41:25.612 --> 00:41:33.638]  They're telling you now, like the thousands of sites banned off Twitter and Facebook in a week, they just said, we consider conservative thoughts spam now.
[00:41:33.638 --> 00:41:34.419]  You're all banned.
[00:41:34.419 --> 00:41:36.260]  Many accounts with millions of followers.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.601]  Veterans groups are being banned.
[00:41:39.326 --> 00:41:40.827]  Christian groups are being banned.
[00:41:40.827 --> 00:41:42.108]  It's all being banned!
[00:41:42.108 --> 00:41:43.169]  It's a takeover!
[00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:48.093]  And then they don't want you pointing it out that it's the archetype of TH61138 or 1984.
[00:41:48.093 --> 00:41:51.196]  You know, this commercial would be banned today.
[00:41:51.196 --> 00:41:58.602]  This 1984 Super Bowl commercial you're about to see would be banned today because it features the MPC!
[00:41:58.602 --> 00:41:59.904]  Back from the future, here it is!
[00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:03.098]  Look at the NPCs!
[00:42:28.706 --> 00:42:30.948]  Our system's all powerful, nothing can crack it.
[00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:33.311]  You all have grey NPC faces.
[00:42:33.311 --> 00:42:34.652]  You are NPC!
[00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:36.835]  You are NPC!
[00:42:36.835 --> 00:42:38.296]  And we say no!
[00:42:38.296 --> 00:42:44.182]  So now they even ban us from showing the archetypal image of what they are!
[00:42:44.182 --> 00:42:47.506]  But InfoWars will shatter them!
[00:42:47.506 --> 00:42:48.026]  Yes!
[00:42:49.642 --> 00:42:54.514]  On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
[00:42:54.514 --> 00:42:58.624]  And you'll see why 1984... Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen!

[00:43:38.321 --> 00:43:52.977]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[00:47:03.369 --> 00:47:10.415]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.415 --> 00:47:14.258]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:47:14.258 --> 00:47:15.960]  He's a punk.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.521]  He's a dog.
[00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:18.382]  He's a pig.
[00:47:18.382 --> 00:47:20.083]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:22.685]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[00:47:22.685 --> 00:47:27.209]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, s*** sucker.
[00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:28.650]  The President of the United States
[00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:30.893]  He's a weak man.
[00:47:30.893 --> 00:47:33.157]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[00:47:33.157 --> 00:47:38.805]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:42.450]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[00:47:50.447 --> 00:47:56.594]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:48:15.652 --> 00:48:18.314]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:18.314 --> 00:48:19.555]  I came to destroy the globalists.
[00:48:19.555 --> 00:48:20.416]  Escape is not my plan.
[00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:45.852]  But I do not face the globalists alone, my friends.
[00:48:45.852 --> 00:48:49.293]  We have God on our side and you are standing right beside me.
[00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.054]  We are doing it.
[00:48:51.054 --> 00:48:56.876]  Prosperity is pouring back in because the president has gotten 20% control of the federal government.
[00:48:59.113 --> 00:49:16.328]  His real sterling achievement is that he can take the attacks, turn them back on the enemy, withstand all the peer pressure, the two billion dollars he's lost of his fortune from all the lawsuits and attacks and golf course deals he lost and tournaments he lost and everything else.
[00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:18.910]  And his family's gone to the fire for us.
[00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:19.971]  He said, I love this country.
[00:49:19.971 --> 00:49:21.773]  I don't need to be president.
[00:49:21.773 --> 00:49:24.175]  I don't want to be president, but I got to do it.
[00:49:24.175 --> 00:49:26.357]  I just can't watch him flush the country.
[00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:29.448]  And everybody screw us over.
[00:49:29.448 --> 00:49:33.816]  Trump's mom is a Scott, and I've learned the cliche is certainly true about Scots from Scotland.
[00:49:33.816 --> 00:49:37.843]  They're the tightest bunch you'll ever run into, but they're also good people and have a lot of courage.
[00:49:37.843 --> 00:49:40.568]  And I got some Scott in my background on my dad's mother's side.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:49.505]  But the point is, is that Trump is the type of guy that constantly gives to charity, never tells anybody.
[00:49:49.505 --> 00:49:51.887]  He helps kids get livers, kidneys.
[00:49:51.887 --> 00:49:56.851]  Sometimes he'll just like somebody that works for him and learn they have a problem and buy him a house.
[00:49:56.851 --> 00:49:58.252]  I mean, this is real stuff Trump does.
[00:49:58.252 --> 00:50:03.335]  But with big companies and other hard nosers, he loves to run over them.
[00:50:03.335 --> 00:50:04.316]  He loves to beat them.
[00:50:04.316 --> 00:50:08.519]  He loves to dominate powerful people that are bad.
[00:50:08.519 --> 00:50:09.600]  And watch in China.
[00:50:10.666 --> 00:50:15.467]  And watching the EU and watching all these people and the globalists sell out the country has been making him sick.
[00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:17.668]  There's interviews with him 40 years ago.
[00:50:17.668 --> 00:50:19.749]  Hard to believe she's been on the air that long.
[00:50:19.749 --> 00:50:23.230]  40 years ago.
[00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.490]  With Oprah Winfrey saying all the same stuff.
[00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.551]  That's who he is.
[00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:29.072]  It's who his dad is.
[00:50:29.072 --> 00:50:39.695]  The New York Times found stories and reports of his dad in the 30s when there were communist riots in New York and police reports about his dad beating up four or five of them.
[00:50:39.695 --> 00:50:39.975]  That was
[00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:46.130]  That was his father.
[00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:51.253]  And so that's where Trump comes from.
[00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:54.115]  Bunch of commies attack him, he beats the hell out of them.
[00:50:54.115 --> 00:50:55.076]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:50:55.076 --> 00:51:00.520]  And we're beating these people now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.522]  There are people that have been perched on top of this nation, selling it out.
[00:51:04.718 --> 00:51:05.078]  We're good to go.
[00:51:25.692 --> 00:51:28.676]  This is a historic time to be alive and I thank God every minute.
[00:51:28.676 --> 00:51:38.170]  So here's Mika Brzezinski, the daughter of a war criminal, shooting her filthy mouth off on her dying, collapsed, failed MSNBC CNBC show.
[00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:38.491]  Here it is.
[00:51:39.545 --> 00:51:43.529]  Look, women and men should not behave this way.
[00:51:43.529 --> 00:51:45.550]  And we should call it out.
[00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:55.559]  And actually, for me, this is one of the many, many, many ways this president has shown us that he is not fit.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.562]  Possibly not even well.
[00:51:58.562 --> 00:52:06.969]  And I don't understand the people in this administration taking matters into their own hands and trying to sort of stick it out because they can keep things together.
[00:52:06.969 --> 00:52:11.512]  On the foreign policy front, he is cratering our reputation.
[00:52:12.493 --> 00:52:14.954]  He is making us an international joke.
[00:52:14.954 --> 00:52:20.217]  We are losing our influence because this is a type of man who calls a woman a horse face.
[00:52:20.217 --> 00:52:22.578]  By the way, a woman he chose to have sex with.
[00:52:22.578 --> 00:52:26.681]  So I don't even know where that begins and ends and I wouldn't want to pick that apart.
[00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:30.863]  But if you look at how he is speaking on the international stage,
[00:52:31.643 --> 00:52:35.146]  About the murder of a Washington Post reporter.
[00:52:35.146 --> 00:52:45.332]  That itself should be deeply disturbing to anybody who works inside the White House, works on the national security team, works in the State Department.
[00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:50.676]  At some point, you are working for a president who is not fit to lead.
[00:52:50.676 --> 00:52:55.399]  Who's going to do something crazy in five minutes, one hour, tonight or tomorrow.
[00:52:55.399 --> 00:53:00.903]  Like what more do you need to hear from him to start thinking 25th Amendment or something else?
[00:53:01.423 --> 00:53:01.743]  Okay.
[00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:03.445]  This is not okay.
[00:53:03.445 --> 00:53:04.466]  You're not okay.
[00:53:04.466 --> 00:53:18.781]  Your father, Zbigniew Brzezinski, led the collapse of Iran, helped put the Ayatollah Khomeini in, and then had the whole botched so-called rescue operation into
[00:53:20.382 --> 00:53:21.602]  Iran.
[00:53:21.602 --> 00:53:27.044]  So you are the loser when you talk about Iran or Saudi Arabia.
[00:53:27.044 --> 00:53:29.705]  So she's talking about overthrowing the president via the cabinet.
[00:53:29.705 --> 00:53:30.985]  And this is how the lie works.
[00:53:30.985 --> 00:53:32.905]  They harass the families of the cabinet.
[00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:33.606]  They harass them.
[00:53:33.606 --> 00:53:37.527]  A lot of them are two-faced and say, oh, yeah, I don't like Trump either.
[00:53:37.527 --> 00:53:41.328]  So they don't get attacked.
[00:53:41.328 --> 00:53:42.668]  And so you got a lot of cowardice going on.
[00:53:42.668 --> 00:53:45.729]  But the idea that, oh, despite Trump,
[00:53:47.076 --> 00:53:48.177]  We're having some success.
[00:53:48.177 --> 00:53:49.658]  That's ridiculous.
[00:53:49.658 --> 00:53:58.423]  It's like Honduras and Guatemala have UN funding through the UN treaty they're part of, that Trump's pulled us out of, that now the rest of Europe's pulling out of.
[00:53:58.423 --> 00:53:59.964]  Globalist coalition falling apart.
[00:53:59.964 --> 00:54:01.285]  That's leadership.
[00:54:01.285 --> 00:54:06.828]  They're sending up hundreds of thousands of people in these caravans to open up these migration lanes.
[00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:09.149]  And Trump said, you do that, I'm cutting your funding.
[00:54:09.149 --> 00:54:11.851]  And within a few hours, they said, okay, we're going to turn them back.
[00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:14.913]  We're not going to take the UN money anymore because the US has given us five times more.
[00:54:16.363 --> 00:54:17.664]  Major national security issue.
[00:54:17.664 --> 00:54:21.048]  But right there, that's immediate.
[00:54:21.048 --> 00:54:25.872]  The economy, thousands of new factories, everything is starting to secure our border.
[00:54:25.872 --> 00:54:27.794]  Arrest of the border up four times.
[00:54:27.794 --> 00:54:34.120]  MS-13 arrest up exponentially, what, 250-something percent.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.546]  Amazing stuff going on, and then you sit there when you've done nothing in your life but be a little rich girl.
[00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:45.224]  Her father was with the failed administration of Jimmy Carter, for God's sakes.
[00:54:45.224 --> 00:54:53.931]  And we're looking at probably the greatest president since George Washington, and you don't know what to do, so you're trying to tell us he's horrible, he's stupid, he's bad.
[00:54:53.931 --> 00:54:59.635]  Meanwhile, he's the only one speaking out against the censorship by big tech that they now admit they're doing to conservatives.
[00:54:59.635 --> 00:55:06.660]  I mean, if someone puts out an MPC meme of a gray face over a group of people acting like sheep, like...
[00:55:07.759 --> 00:55:18.627]  Apple ads, and like 1984, and like THX1138, and every other dystopic movie and book, you know that you're in a cult and you got shaved heads like the Hillbop cult!
[00:55:18.627 --> 00:55:22.150]  And you're wearing grey uniforms!
[00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.033]  And now you want to tell our kids they can't have mommy or daddy, or they can't say they're a boy and girl.
[00:55:26.033 --> 00:55:28.955]  That's beyond 1984.
[00:55:28.955 --> 00:55:31.637]  They were just talking about getting rid of the family in 1984.
[00:55:31.637 --> 00:55:32.698]  You're actually trying to do it!
[00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:41.012]  You people are monsters and so everyone just keep making the NPC memes and let them ban us.
[00:55:41.012 --> 00:55:47.234]  We're going to create a whole section for memes the next week on InfoWars.com like a message board.
[00:55:47.234 --> 00:55:52.617]  Where you can just go in like Reddit, whatever, and just post as long as it's legal and lawful.
[00:55:52.617 --> 00:55:55.197]  You're racist, you're not racist, you're Christian, you're not Christian, whatever.
[00:55:55.197 --> 00:55:56.158]  As long as it's not illegal.
[00:55:57.298 --> 00:56:09.222]  Long as it's not threats, we're going to bring internet freedom back, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll just have Memes Central, and the best ones will be on the front page, and we're going to have daily prizes for memes, because it's memes that threaten them the most.
[00:56:09.222 --> 00:56:15.845]  In fact, I'm going to announce a super-fast contest that I will determine, and that I will announce next Monday, $10,000 for the best InfoWars-themed
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.461]  MPC meme.
[00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:23.102]  And I will judge because it's too hard to send them all in and look at them.
[00:56:23.102 --> 00:56:26.504]  Just send them to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, ContestInfoWars.com.
[00:56:26.504 --> 00:56:27.525]  I'll look at them all.
[00:56:27.525 --> 00:56:31.827]  And then you send in who you are and where it came from and the providence of it.
[00:56:31.827 --> 00:56:33.989]  And $10,000, whoever does the best NPC meme.
[00:56:33.989 --> 00:56:37.311]  You're going to have to wait a month like other great contests we've had.
[00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:39.632]  We'll do it right away.
[00:56:39.632 --> 00:56:44.855]  InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com themed NPC memes.
[00:56:44.855 --> 00:56:46.916]  Because you had InfoWars and NPC.
[00:56:46.916 --> 00:56:47.937]  Boy, that would break the internet.
[00:56:50.635 --> 00:56:54.617]  Oh, InfoWars themed with myself, Paul Watson, any of the crew.
[00:56:54.617 --> 00:56:55.778]  Working in however you want.
[00:56:55.778 --> 00:56:57.099]  I want to see that meme magic.

[00:57:09.087 --> 00:57:11.090]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.

[00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:22.356]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[00:58:22.356 --> 00:58:24.077]  Ordered it six months ago.
[00:58:24.077 --> 00:58:25.078]  So I get the price down.
[00:58:25.078 --> 00:58:26.818]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[00:58:26.818 --> 00:58:28.079]  I'm breaking the contract.
[00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:30.040]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.421]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:34.202]  In fact, right now, it is the last run.
[00:58:34.202 --> 00:58:36.222]  The survival shield X2.
[00:58:36.222 --> 00:58:37.703]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[00:58:37.703 --> 00:58:39.424]  It'll be gone a couple months.

[00:58:42.405 --> 00:58:44.246]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[00:58:44.246 --> 00:58:45.687]  I suggest you stop up on it.

[00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:52.867]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:58:52.867 --> 00:58:59.170]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:01.150]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:07.813]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.

[00:59:13.975 --> 00:59:18.097]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an important part
[00:59:18.097 --> 00:59:18.437]  I think so.
[00:59:52.762 --> 00:59:55.385]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.621 --> 01:00:19.922]  I ain't saying she's a gold digger.
[01:00:19.922 --> 01:00:22.784]  She ain't messing with no you-know-what.
[01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:31.728]  She ain't messing with no poor men.
[01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.288]  And you see everybody trying to get into the country.
[01:00:33.288 --> 01:00:37.010]  As soon as they get here, they're told to hate it and bitch about it and complain it's the worst place on earth.
[01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.992]  But you got a bunch of gold diggers coming in here.
[01:00:39.992 --> 01:00:44.714]  You got a bunch of globalists coming in here trying to manipulate everybody.
[01:00:44.714 --> 01:00:46.915]  You got horse-face Stormy Daniels.
[01:00:48.777 --> 01:01:05.310]  Working for that peon lawyer who is sinking faster than the Hindenburg on that stormy night in the United States when it went belly up and burned like a lead zeppelin.
[01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:09.714]  That's right, she's not messing with a
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.961]  The globalists want to come here and rob the country.
[01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.362]  They almost robbed everything.
[01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:16.044]  And then they want to tell us, stay in line.
[01:01:16.044 --> 01:01:17.024]  Hey, this is a powerful report.
[01:01:17.024 --> 01:01:18.125]  I'm only playing a part of it.
[01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.766]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:01:19.766 --> 01:01:22.128]  Millie Weaver, the best part's towards the end.
[01:01:22.128 --> 01:01:24.850]  I'm just going to air the first of it here, because I want you to go get it and spread it.
[01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:26.311]  Young black conservative defends Trump.
[01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:31.936]  And coming up, powerful highlights of Cruz versus Beto last night.
[01:01:31.936 --> 01:01:33.116]  So that's coming up straight ahead.
[01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:33.537]  Stay with us.
[01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:43.024]  Okay, so right now the protesters are over there chanting, F Nazis.
[01:01:43.024 --> 01:01:44.666]  No, they're chanting Black Nazis.
[01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:45.607]  Is that what they're saying?
[01:01:45.607 --> 01:01:45.747]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.276 --> 01:01:52.997]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:01:52.997 --> 01:02:01.159]  I'm here with Joel Patrick, the well-known social media conservative icon, and he's also here at this Trump rally.
[01:02:01.159 --> 01:02:08.361]  I've been talking to the protesters and just like trying to engage with them, trying to get logical arguments, which can be difficult, out of them.
[01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:14.663]  And a lot of times they just try to shut you down or, you know, they try to explain that you're a racist KKK member and then you say, well, I'm black.
[01:02:14.663 --> 01:02:18.824]  And then they just kind of look at you with a dumb look on their face and it just keeps happening over and over again.
[01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:21.606]  So, how are they saying that to you?
[01:02:21.606 --> 01:02:25.189]  I mean, how are they calling you KKK and racist?
[01:02:25.189 --> 01:02:26.070]  Because I support Trump.
[01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:37.399]  They say if you support a racist, you are a racist, which, you know, he's not a racist, and it's actually impossible to be a black member of the KKK, but, you know, like, meat-eating vegans and Jewish Nazis, it just doesn't work out.
[01:02:37.979 --> 01:02:45.782]  Yeah, you know, I was speaking to a protester over here and he said earlier that Kanye lost his black card because he supports Trump.
[01:02:45.782 --> 01:02:47.902]  Is that kind of the same reaction you're getting?
[01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:49.483]  Yeah, I get a lot of the same reaction.
[01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:53.084]  So being black is not about, you know, supporting
[01:02:53.824 --> 01:02:56.145]  A particular political ideology.
[01:02:56.145 --> 01:02:58.025]  You're black, that's a skin color.
[01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.166]  A lot of people ask me, they say, hey, are you an African American?
[01:03:00.166 --> 01:03:01.967]  No, I'm not an African American, I'm just an American.
[01:03:01.967 --> 01:03:04.827]  I'm a black American, but I'm not an African American.
[01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:10.529]  And the thing that they wanna say is, you're not invited to the cookout anymore, you lost your black card.
[01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:11.790]  It's complete nonsense.
[01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.390]  What they mean is, you've left the plantation.
[01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:20.732]  And the reason that they can't say you've left the plantation is because then they'll be exposed for the true racists that they are.
[01:03:20.732 --> 01:03:22.733]  The racists that brought us slavery, Jim Crow and the KKK.
[01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:29.738]  The racists that abort 900 black babies every single day under the guise of parenthood.
[01:03:29.738 --> 01:03:33.801]  So can you tell us why you support Trump?
[01:03:33.801 --> 01:03:44.890]  I support Trump because Trump has my best interests in mind and he wants a strong country and we've seen that by him not worrying about black people as a specific group but just worrying about the country, he's helped black people.
[01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.733]  You see the lowest black unemployment in history.
[01:03:47.733 --> 01:03:48.053]  You see
[01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:58.248]  The lowest Hispanic unemployment in history because Trump has removed the divide by helping everyone and not being racist about how he helps people.
[01:03:59.474 --> 01:04:03.476]  Have you had any encounters with the protesters out here tonight yet?
[01:04:03.476 --> 01:04:05.237]  Yes, I have.
[01:04:05.237 --> 01:04:06.657]  What was that like?
[01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:09.359]  They were very, extremely intolerant.
[01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:12.060]  And one guy said, I can't believe you're wearing that.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.181]  You know you're black.
[01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:14.001]  That's what he said to me.
[01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:17.042]  A white guy asked me if I knew I was black.
[01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:22.465]  And apparently for him, it's not OK for a black person to support the president because the president is a racist.
[01:04:23.662 --> 01:04:32.928]  I, you know, I can't stress enough that every time they say the president is racist, you ask them for an example, they bring up these isolated incidents and they say, well, he didn't denounce Charlottesville.
[01:04:32.928 --> 01:04:35.629]  So I said, so if you don't denounce something, you're guilty of it?
[01:04:35.629 --> 01:04:36.510]  He said, yes.
[01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.070]  I said, that's fine.
[01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:40.472]  We're going to go to break, but I got to add here, he did denounce both sides.
[01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:41.153]  They just lie.
[01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:42.794]  Like they say, he says all Mexicans are criminals.
[01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:44.853]  There is no video of that.
[01:04:44.853 --> 01:04:48.195]  It's like them saying I say there's human slaves on Mars.
[01:04:48.195 --> 01:04:49.556]  I never said anything like that.
[01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:50.757]  It's a lie!
[01:04:50.757 --> 01:04:52.298]  They just lie!
[01:04:52.298 --> 01:04:53.319]  Powerful video.
[01:04:53.319 --> 01:04:55.320]  Full videos on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:55.801]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.456 --> 01:05:07.947]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:12.633]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.633 --> 01:05:17.038]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.398 --> 01:05:20.460]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.882]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:22.882 --> 01:05:26.444]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:30.807]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:05:30.807 --> 01:05:39.373]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:05:39.373 --> 01:05:40.054]  Read the facts.
[01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:41.594]  We're good to go.
[01:06:07.745 --> 01:06:13.678]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:18.582 --> 01:06:30.467]  I am very concerned, and I know there are millions of Texans who are concerned, about the political bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google, skewing and silencing the voices of those who politically they disagree with.
[01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:39.912]  You may remember several months ago, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, testified before the Senate, and I asked him a series of vigorous questions about the political bias at Facebook.
[01:06:40.592 --> 01:06:45.014]  Now, even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content, there are two things we should think about doing.
[01:06:45.014 --> 01:06:52.636]  Number one, right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption that they would be neutral and fair.
[01:06:52.636 --> 01:06:59.879]  If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.
[01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:03.460]  Number two, the giant tech companies, by any measure, are bigger
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:12.202]  ...than AT&T was when it was broken up under the antitrust laws, bigger than Standard Oil, and if they're abusing market powers and monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced.
[01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:17.124]  And that's why we love Ted Cruz.
[01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:30.055]  You know, I am such a fan of Ted Cruz, and I'm so demonized in mainstream media, some think that would hurt him, but it doesn't.
[01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:36.419]  That's why I got really mad at him during the campaign when he started getting dirty against Trump, the Republican establishment.
[01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:47.086]  But he has reprieved himself, he has a perfect voting record, and he probably is the smartest person in the Senate.
[01:07:47.086 --> 01:07:48.147]  In fact, most of them agree that.
[01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:52.430]  On top of his class, Supreme Court justices that he worked under say that he knows more than they do.
[01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:55.992]  He's good to have on our team.
[01:07:55.992 --> 01:08:01.256]  And you compare him to Beto O'Rourke, it is not even the same universe.
[01:08:01.256 --> 01:08:05.239]  That guy is a bumbling, stumbling liar.
[01:08:05.239 --> 01:08:10.203]  He's been involved in a hit-and-run, just like Chris Cuomo he got away with.
[01:08:10.203 --> 01:08:13.545]  His mother's a lifelong Democrat, they found it going back decades.
[01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:17.428]  First they found him voting for Obama 10 years ago and all the rest of it.
[01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:20.210]  Now they found stuff going back 30 years.
[01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:20.911]  He is a liar.
[01:08:22.199 --> 01:08:24.481]  And he has these canned responses up there.
[01:08:24.481 --> 01:08:33.929]  And it just is a nightmare situation to watch them spend more money on him than they would spend a decade ago in a presidential race.
[01:08:33.929 --> 01:08:37.172]  He's raised $36 million in the last month.
[01:08:37.172 --> 01:08:38.933]  All total is something like $100 million.
[01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:47.481]  I mean, it's just insane to live in Texas and to see him plastered everywhere and to know what a giant stinking fraud he is.
[01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:55.435]  But I believe in Texas, and I believe we're going to keep Ted Cruz.
[01:08:55.435 --> 01:09:15.252]  I know I got really, really mad at Ted Cruz, and then I strangely enough ran into him on Election Day, and I ran into him on Inauguration Day, and I was pretty angry at him at the time, but looking back in hindsight,
[01:09:16.633 --> 01:09:18.294]  You don't know what you got until it's gone.
[01:09:18.294 --> 01:09:20.356]  Please, God, let Ted Cruz stay in the Senate.
[01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.177]  Please.
[01:09:21.177 --> 01:09:23.719]  They would have gotten gun control bills through if it wasn't for him.
[01:09:23.719 --> 01:09:29.104]  He's helped begin to pare back Obamacare.
[01:09:29.104 --> 01:09:30.845]  I mean, he's just smart.
[01:09:30.845 --> 01:09:39.712]  He helped Senator Paul reverse, six years ago, Obama backing Al Qaeda and then ISIS in Syria and blowing the borders of Europe up.
[01:09:39.712 --> 01:09:43.336]  I mean, Ted Cruz has been one of the critical game changers.
[01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:45.296]  And we need him in there.
[01:09:45.296 --> 01:09:49.800]  And I'm telling you folks, you need to call all your friends and family.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.263]  You need to go and get Grandma out of the nursing home and take her to vote.
[01:09:54.263 --> 01:09:56.045]  Because coming up next segment...
[01:09:57.208 --> 01:10:11.173]  We knew this was going on, but they have caught a ring of Democrats going through the list of either dead people on voter rolls, out of the obituaries, or people that again are in nursing homes, and then they steal their identity.
[01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:12.614]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:10:12.614 --> 01:10:16.155]  Go to Grandma, go to Grandpa, and say, do you like Ted Cruz?
[01:10:16.155 --> 01:10:18.156]  Do you like the Second Amendment?
[01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:23.318]  And, you know, even if they've got Alzheimer's, if they say yes, you take them down and you have them vote.
[01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.961]  That's not cheating in my view.
[01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.302]  We don't do what the Democrats do.
[01:10:28.302 --> 01:10:33.003]  When they go low, we work twice as hard.
[01:10:33.003 --> 01:10:39.344]  But you need to absolutely bust your butt.
[01:10:39.344 --> 01:10:45.345]  And what you also need to do, in my humble opinion, please, is... This is about protecting Trump.
[01:10:45.345 --> 01:10:49.846]  If we lose that Senate, they will impeach him as fast as the sun came up in the morning.
[01:10:52.065 --> 01:10:53.606]  And can you imagine what this is going to be like?
[01:10:53.606 --> 01:10:55.788]  We have to secure the republic.
[01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:58.709]  We have to get our industrial base just for national security back.
[01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:00.150]  We have to do it now.
[01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:10.938]  Now, speaking of Ted Cruz and how he got into the internet censorship that's going on, bottom of the hour I'm going to get into this and I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:11:10.938 --> 01:11:20.084]  Sundar, that's the guy's name that heads up Google, has been caught lying repeatedly about censorship.
[01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:33.836]  Well now because his own engineers are going public and quitting in droves, we're talking top engineers, he's then hiding it in plain view saying, oh it's no big deal, censorship is good, it's helpful, yes of course we're doing it, and we're going to do it here too.
[01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:37.778]  So they're now doing the hide it in plain view thing.
[01:11:37.778 --> 01:11:42.180]  Just like the New York Times says, thank God they're banning MPC memes that just put
[01:11:43.348 --> 01:11:49.490]  Grey emotionless faces over throngs of leftists and memes to show they're a bunch of automatons being programmed.
[01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:54.192]  That's the symbol of authoritarianism, is a grey face, emotionless.
[01:11:54.192 --> 01:12:03.315]  In 1984, in THX 1138, in Apple commercials, in all dystopic systems.
[01:12:03.315 --> 01:12:07.536]  But here they are in the New York Times front page saying, get them, get in there and censor.
[01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:11.640]  See, notice, I knew the censorship was coming.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.904]  They already had us dialed back 95%.
[01:12:13.904 --> 01:12:15.506]  And nobody would stand up to it.
[01:12:15.506 --> 01:12:17.289]  And so, did I try to get banned?
[01:12:17.289 --> 01:12:21.436]  Like, uh, the head of Facebook said about me?
[01:12:21.436 --> 01:12:22.778]  Oh, we think Jones wanted to be banned.
[01:12:23.891 --> 01:12:28.093]  No, I didn't want to be banned, but I wasn't going to self-censor.
[01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:34.937]  So I sat there and had a meeting with my dad, and I've told you part of the meeting, but my dad works with us here because I can trust him.
[01:12:34.937 --> 01:12:35.637]  He does a great job.
[01:12:35.637 --> 01:12:37.798]  He said, man, you're really pushing it.
[01:12:37.798 --> 01:12:38.699]  You're going to get banned everywhere.
[01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:40.400]  I said, dad, I'm already banned.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.461]  He said, well, just don't go further than you would.
[01:12:42.461 --> 01:12:43.301]  Don't let them goad you.
[01:12:43.301 --> 01:12:43.962]  And I said, I'm not.
[01:12:44.862 --> 01:12:54.124]  I'm sitting back and thinking about what would I really be saying, and if I've begun to govern what I say, not because what I'm saying is not true, but because I don't want to be censored.
[01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:57.405]  And I said, I have begun to bend my will.
[01:12:57.405 --> 01:13:02.366]  And so I'm going to go on air and say what I really think.
[01:13:02.366 --> 01:13:06.087]  And they're going to ban me before the election.
[01:13:06.087 --> 01:13:09.348]  They're planning after the election to ban everybody publicly.
[01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:11.108]  They're planning now to just do it quietly.
[01:13:11.108 --> 01:13:13.269]  I'm going to force them to ban me.
[01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.208]  And I said, I believe it'll be in the next two weeks.
[01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:17.629]  And it was exactly two weeks.
[01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:24.552]  I don't know how I know this stuff, but when I go with my gut, and I have this feeling, I tingle all over.
[01:13:24.552 --> 01:13:26.533]  It's like a divining rod, you know, finding the water.
[01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:28.274]  It just happens.
[01:13:28.274 --> 01:13:31.156]  And my dad said, well, I'm sure it's going to happen.
[01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:31.676]  And it did.
[01:13:31.676 --> 01:13:33.757]  Boom!
[01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:38.039]  But I didn't say anything bad or do anything bad.
[01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:40.721]  They misrepresented what I said and did to get rid of me.
[01:13:42.079 --> 01:13:44.520]  Because they don't want real truth being spoken.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:59.205]  So we're going to come back and get to more of the debate between Beto and Ted Cruz and just the lies of this guy that you'll hear when we come back.
[01:13:59.205 --> 01:14:03.227]  And then I'm going to get into China and Google and Apple.
[01:14:03.227 --> 01:14:08.309]  I mean, you understand what a threat it is that these companies are openly suppressing the Chinese people and now publicly
[01:14:10.615 --> 01:14:13.836]  At TV news conferences, bragging about it and smiling.
[01:14:13.836 --> 01:14:19.978]  But see, it's okay, because Shandar has dark hair and dark skin.
[01:14:19.978 --> 01:14:21.258]  And that's the whole leftist thing.
[01:14:21.258 --> 01:14:27.119]  As long as the person's not white, it's okay.
[01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:30.160]  And that's the true mental illness of the situation.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.041]  We're gonna go to break and come back with all of that.
[01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:36.042]  But please remember, we're having the biggest sale in our history right now.
[01:14:37.082 --> 01:14:38.563]  Because they've taken PayPal.
[01:14:38.563 --> 01:14:39.904]  Oh, see, build your own business.
[01:14:39.904 --> 01:14:44.446]  And they're trying to take our software away, and they're trying to take everything away.
[01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.928]  And they're harassing and threatening and lying about us to do it.
[01:14:46.928 --> 01:14:50.010]  And saying, ban Alex Jones, he harasses people on the internet.
[01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:58.395]  You got George Soros-funded groups organizing millions of Democrats to do it, saying that then we're the ones harassing people online.
[01:14:58.395 --> 01:14:59.996]  Isn't that just peachy king?
[01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:02.237]  And doxing everybody and threatening everybody.
[01:15:02.237 --> 01:15:05.259]  This is a group of knuckle-dragging thugs and bullies.

[01:15:36.514 --> 01:15:40.516]  I've met with many people that's come out in the news at highest level globalist meetings.
[01:15:40.516 --> 01:15:47.380]  They literally hate my guts because we have the spirit of resistance and victory and renaissance and the future.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.700]  And they want to extinguish InfoWars.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.741]  So don't let them!

[01:15:57.233 --> 01:16:03.575]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.575 --> 01:16:06.616]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.616 --> 01:16:12.538]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.538 --> 01:16:16.339]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.599]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.599 --> 01:16:18.940]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:25.141]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.141 --> 01:16:26.582]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:17:29.282 --> 01:17:30.063]  Not true.
[01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:31.924]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:17:31.924 --> 01:17:35.907]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[01:20:01.886 --> 01:20:04.509]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.285 --> 01:20:11.406]  Big Brother.
[01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.206]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:13.206 --> 01:20:15.087]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:15.087 --> 01:20:16.768]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:18.428]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:18.428 --> 01:20:23.110]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:51.017]  All right, here is a highlight reel of Beto versus Cruz.
[01:20:51.017 --> 01:20:57.284]  And when you know the Texas policies and national policies, you know about Beto like I do living here in Austin.
[01:20:57.284 --> 01:20:59.306]  I mean, the guy is an incredible liar.
[01:21:00.802 --> 01:21:03.804]  He said that El Paso is super safe and there's no crime on the border.
[01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:05.566]  That's all coming up.
[01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:07.007]  And the border's not a big issue.
[01:21:07.007 --> 01:21:10.069]  I mean, Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead.
[01:21:10.069 --> 01:21:18.275]  It's a beautiful country in many areas, nice people in many areas, but much of it is a war zone, most dangerous country in the world.
[01:21:18.275 --> 01:21:23.118]  But I'm digressing.
[01:21:23.118 --> 01:21:25.320]  When I was a kid, we used to go down to the border.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.281]  It's not safe anywhere.
[01:21:28.066 --> 01:21:29.248]  Not even in Big Bend anymore.
[01:21:29.248 --> 01:21:35.338]  And that's in the middle of nowhere, 500 miles from any town of any size.
[01:21:35.338 --> 01:21:37.362]  It's dangerous as hell.
[01:21:37.362 --> 01:21:41.509]  But let's go ahead and get this compilation because this Senate race is so critical.
[01:21:41.509 --> 01:21:41.829]  Here it is.
[01:21:43.015 --> 01:21:46.677]  Our junior senator will not stand up to President Trump.
[01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:54.821]  Someone who apologizes for Russia, defends that country, Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy.
[01:21:54.821 --> 01:22:01.864]  He won't stand up against him and he won't stand up for us to make sure that our election... People always ask me if I'm trained in NLP.
[01:22:01.864 --> 01:22:02.825]  I've been doing this for 20 years.
[01:22:02.825 --> 01:22:04.226]  I went and looked it up 20 years ago.
[01:22:05.026 --> 01:22:11.570]  It's basically in marketing and stuff, it's these cadences and how people talk and then terms they use to highlight things.
[01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:14.611]  No, I'm not trained professionally in any of that.
[01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:17.933]  I'm trained in telling the truth, and I talk the way I talk.
[01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:24.817]  A lot of people notice I make hand gestures like Trump does, and I mean, these are all well-known gestures, just things I do naturally.
[01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:33.542]  But Beto O'Rourke, do you notice with him, it is NLP, and Trump isn't professionally trained, he's trained in the streets of persuasion and the truth.
[01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:43.312]  But you look at B-Dub, he's trying to sound like Obama, with the cadence and the way he's saying it, and the whole thing is disgusting.
[01:22:43.312 --> 01:22:45.735]  That's why they're calling him the new Obama.
[01:22:45.735 --> 01:22:50.259]  Yes, they don't just want him in the Senate, they think this guy is gonna be the next president.
[01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:51.500]  I mean, another...
[01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:59.165]  Blue blood establishment trying to pose like a real person when he never built anything in his life.
[01:22:59.165 --> 01:23:05.549]  And his mother's a lifelong Democrat, but to trick Republicans to vote for him, that my mom was a Republican, but she's voting for me.
[01:23:05.549 --> 01:23:08.050]  You are a lying piece of garbage!
[01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:11.072]  You say you want to ban all semi-auto rifles in Texas!
[01:23:11.072 --> 01:23:12.353]  You want open borders!
[01:23:12.353 --> 01:23:14.394]  You are an enemy of this country!
[01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:18.776]  You are a globalist piece of filth with the CHICOMS!
[01:23:18.776 --> 01:23:19.497]  You make me sick!
[01:23:20.686 --> 01:23:22.547]  Anyways, just looking at him makes me want to vomit.
[01:23:22.547 --> 01:23:23.488]  He's so fake.
[01:23:23.488 --> 01:23:26.290]  All I know is he's a frat boy, blue blood, chicken necks.
[01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:27.651]  Carpetbagging down here in Texas.
[01:23:27.651 --> 01:23:28.232]  Go back to him.
[01:23:29.113 --> 01:23:35.097]  For us to make sure that our elections are free and fair, that your vote goes to the intended candidate.
[01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:38.540]  This is beyond party politics.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.063]  This is getting our democracy back on track.
[01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:43.123]  Our country's on track.
[01:23:43.123 --> 01:23:44.344]  It paused.
[01:23:44.344 --> 01:23:48.167]  It's the Democrats trying to censor all the Republicans and all the conservatives and all the Christians.
[01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:49.828]  It's the Democrats threatening everybody.
[01:23:49.828 --> 01:23:52.410]  But you talk about our democracy's under threat.
[01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:54.372]  You are the threat, you little piece of crap!
[01:23:55.208 --> 01:23:56.369]  Sorry, just go back to it.
[01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:18.786]  Congressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them, and he wants to see, like Hillary Clinton promised to appoint, left-wing judicial activists who impose their own policy preferences from the bench.
[01:24:18.786 --> 01:24:20.367]  I don't think that's what the people of Texas want.
[01:24:20.367 --> 01:24:25.129]  We want judges and justices who will follow the Constitution and follow the law.
[01:24:25.129 --> 01:24:28.751]  This is what you can expect over the course of this debate.
[01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:30.512]  Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you.
[01:24:31.493 --> 01:24:34.900]  I mean, even Main Street News admits he talks like Obama, which is totally fake talk.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.483]  There's videos of Obama in the 80s and 90s.
[01:24:36.483 --> 01:24:37.304]  It doesn't sound like that.
[01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:41.544]  It's just a voice like this, almost like Bernie Sanders.
[01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:43.205]  I am of the authority.
[01:24:43.205 --> 01:24:45.707]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:47.068]  Yeah, there it is, Market Watch.
[01:24:47.068 --> 01:24:52.111]  Beto O'Rourke hailed as Obama-like for President 2020.
[01:24:52.111 --> 01:24:54.532]  Both never did anything in their lives.
[01:24:54.532 --> 01:24:58.275]  Both look like they could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
[01:24:58.275 --> 01:25:00.676]  Both are scumbags that hate the country.
[01:25:00.676 --> 01:25:04.219]  Let's go back to... And both look like they have Mr. Ed teeth.
[01:25:05.725 --> 01:25:11.927]  Oh, well, boy, if you bred Beto O'Rourke with Stormy Daniels, you would actually have a real horse.
[01:25:11.927 --> 01:25:12.847]  Well, wait.
[01:25:12.847 --> 01:25:15.708]  If you breed a jackass, a donkey with a horse, you'd get a mule.
[01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:16.448]  You'd have a mule!
[01:25:16.448 --> 01:25:19.589]  They'd have a little baby mule!
[01:25:19.589 --> 01:25:20.970]  Oh, get both of them off the screen.
[01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:22.790]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:24.871]  Oh, I'm so sick of these fakes.
[01:25:24.871 --> 01:25:26.111]  Go back to Pito.
[01:25:26.111 --> 01:25:27.792]  I mean, yeah, Pito O'Rourke.
[01:25:27.792 --> 01:25:28.092]  Here it is.
[01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:29.749]  I'm not going to be honest with you.
[01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:34.511]  He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken.
[01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:35.331]  He's dishonest.
[01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:37.592]  That's why the president called- You're dishonest!
[01:25:37.592 --> 01:25:38.432]  You're dishonest!
[01:25:38.432 --> 01:25:40.813]  You li- I said stop.
[01:25:40.813 --> 01:25:41.874]  Go back to him.
[01:25:41.874 --> 01:25:44.154]  Ted, and it's why the nickname stuck.
[01:25:44.154 --> 01:25:45.375]  Because it's true.
[01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:48.416]  Congressman O'Rourke, not only opposes a wall- Pause again.
[01:25:48.416 --> 01:25:49.456]  Back up ten seconds.
[01:25:49.456 --> 01:25:50.717]  Trump said lying Ted.
[01:25:51.986 --> 01:25:54.147]  About things that happened in the campaign.
[01:25:54.147 --> 01:25:56.769]  Ted Cruz has always kept his promise about votes, that's what matters.
[01:25:56.769 --> 01:26:01.692]  And he did make me mad, he did do some flip-flopping in the campaign, and things he said about Trump.
[01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:07.316]  But don't sit there and use Trump's quotes, bedo, when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz!
[01:26:07.316 --> 01:26:12.279]  It doesn't fit when you're a Democrat, saying that to Ted Cruz, when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz!
[01:26:13.746 --> 01:26:14.808]  We gotta get a nickname.
[01:26:14.808 --> 01:26:16.671]  It looks like a big, fat pedophile to me.
[01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:19.597]  I mean, most Democrats are anyways at that level, so who knows?
[01:26:19.597 --> 01:26:21.861]  I say guilt by association.
[01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.085]  He's probably not a pedophile.
[01:26:24.085 --> 01:26:24.826]  He just looks like one.
[01:26:24.826 --> 01:26:25.407]  Let's go back to him.
[01:26:26.135 --> 01:26:28.296]  Nicknames stuck because it's true.
[01:26:28.296 --> 01:26:34.718]  Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall, but he has said we have too many fences and walls already on the border.
[01:26:34.718 --> 01:26:36.258]  He wants to tear down the ones we have.
[01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:38.639]  And I'll note he brought up El Paso.
[01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:44.480]  El Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.301]  3,000 murders last year.
[01:26:45.301 --> 01:26:46.221]  There's a wall there.
[01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:49.904]  That wall is one of the tools you use to protect us.
[01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:54.067]  All you heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of.
[01:26:54.067 --> 01:26:56.129]  It's a campaign based on fear.
[01:26:56.129 --> 01:27:03.796]  It's the same person who shut down the government of the United States of America for 16 days, perhaps because he thought too many people had too much health care.
[01:27:03.796 --> 01:27:05.878]  Hit the pause again.
[01:27:05.878 --> 01:27:08.500]  Obamacare ripped everybody off in triple prices.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.602]  The Democrats shut down the government all the time and get what they want.
[01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:20.339]  ...to take away health care from millions of American families and vows to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions.
[01:27:20.339 --> 01:27:22.620]  I want people to have more health care.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.902]  I want people to be well enough to finish their education, to go to school.
[01:27:25.902 --> 01:27:36.167]  I want to bring people of Texas together, Republicans and Democrats alike, from all parts of the state, to make sure that we meet on an issue that we understand better than anyone else.
[01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:42.771]  If we are reducing the barriers, whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else, so we're selling more,
[01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:44.152]  That's a good thing.
[01:27:44.152 --> 01:27:48.216]  If we're erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.
[01:27:48.216 --> 01:27:54.543]  Really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the U.S.
[01:27:54.543 --> 01:27:57.265]  Senate.
[01:27:57.265 --> 01:28:01.410]  If you have this special relationship with... Pause again.
[01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:04.152]  They're the ones that lied with all the fake stuff and they got beaten.
[01:28:04.152 --> 01:28:05.834]  They were the circus, not the Republicans.
[01:28:05.834 --> 01:28:06.214]  Continue.
[01:28:07.514 --> 01:28:10.657]  Then where is the result of that?
[01:28:10.657 --> 01:28:13.439]  You are all talk and no action.
[01:28:13.439 --> 01:28:21.426]  The tariffs that the President has levied, the trade wars that he has entered this country into, is hurting no state more than it's hurting Texas.
[01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:26.050]  Our farmers, our ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers, and our exporters.
[01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:33.696]  I think the lowest point we have seen is the confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh, where we saw Senate Democrats
[01:28:35.803 --> 01:28:38.925]  Be willing to smear Judge Kavanaugh and his family.
[01:28:38.925 --> 01:28:45.169]  Be willing to repeat unsupported, uncorroborated allegations and go after him in a way that I thought was shameful.
[01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:49.571]  It was important that that process be fair, that Dr. Ford get a full federal opportunity.
[01:28:49.571 --> 01:28:51.292]  Everyone, we better elect Ted Cruz to the Senate.
[01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.574]  This is a national emergency and he's not elected.
[01:28:57.356 --> 01:29:00.237]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[01:29:00.237 --> 01:29:05.118]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.
[01:29:05.118 --> 01:29:10.700]  Decentralized blockchain solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:18.943]  Vercell Media has helped companies raise tens of millions in the past year alone, structuring and marketing ICOs to the thirsty crypto public worldwide.
[01:29:18.943 --> 01:29:21.403]  Don't miss the cryptocurrency revolution.

[01:29:27.651 --> 01:29:28.852]  Hear that?
[01:29:28.852 --> 01:29:34.237]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:34.237 --> 01:29:37.139]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:40.702]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:32:06.483 --> 01:32:07.944]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:07.944 --> 01:32:12.647]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:04.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.688 --> 01:33:23.771]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:28.894]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.894 --> 01:33:31.855]  You know, Beto O'Rourke wants to ban semi-autos.
[01:33:31.855 --> 01:33:33.276]  Beto O'Rourke wants open borders.
[01:33:33.276 --> 01:33:36.378]  Beto O'Rourke wants to put globalist, communist types on the Supreme Court.
[01:33:36.378 --> 01:33:37.619]  That's enough to vote against him.
[01:33:37.619 --> 01:33:39.460]  And it's not fair.
[01:33:40.706 --> 01:33:42.147]  To, you know, say he's a pedophile.
[01:33:42.147 --> 01:33:42.887]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:33:42.887 --> 01:33:56.134]  I'm saying if I was casting a creepy pervert or somebody like run a mortuary or something that like kidnaps kids and eats them or something for a horror movie with Halloween coming up, I would, I would have him working in the ghoul shop.
[01:33:56.134 --> 01:34:03.518]  He wouldn't be the head guy, but Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke, he would be definitely working on the House of Horrors.
[01:34:03.518 --> 01:34:06.000]  Now, who would be the head guy?
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.600]  Brian Stelter.
[01:34:07.799 --> 01:34:13.845]  I mean, I don't think Brian Skelter is a pedophile, but he looks like the Subway founder, who is one.
[01:34:13.845 --> 01:34:20.732]  And so many of these guys have that look, you know the pedo look, like Salon and Vice worships pedophilia now.
[01:34:22.093 --> 01:34:24.755]  And they say how great it is all the time.
[01:34:24.755 --> 01:34:27.057]  And say, you know, it's good for this to happen to kids.
[01:34:27.057 --> 01:34:30.060]  They have a right for men to come pick your daughter or son up.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:39.427]  And so all I'm saying is, central casting folks, central casting, these guys look like slimy pieces of crap that you wouldn't let get anywhere near your children.
[01:34:39.427 --> 01:34:42.550]  Of course, they want to abort your children before they're born.
[01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:44.932]  They want to kill your children, if they could, before they're born.
[01:34:44.932 --> 01:34:47.214]  And they want to feed them GMO and give them deadly vaccines.
[01:34:48.797 --> 01:34:57.302]  But we have attacks rolling in of GOP headquarters getting firebombed, getting attacked with rape sprayed on them, people getting beat up, people getting shot.
[01:34:57.302 --> 01:34:59.103]  I mean, you know about all of it.
[01:34:59.103 --> 01:35:02.825]  And it's coming in so fast, we're almost getting numb to it.
[01:35:02.825 --> 01:35:06.047]  But there have been new firebombing attacks, knife attacks all over Europe.
[01:35:06.047 --> 01:35:08.529]  I haven't even covered them the last three days.
[01:35:08.529 --> 01:35:10.510]  There's like three or four attacks today.
[01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:12.831]  Without me looking for them, it's in here.
[01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:18.215]  Hostage taking, firebombing, shooting, hand grenades, stabbings, mass rapes.
[01:35:20.134 --> 01:35:21.774]  And here's another one!
[01:35:21.774 --> 01:35:22.635]  It's out of Free Beacon.
[01:35:22.635 --> 01:35:24.715]  Two GOP candidates assaulted in Minnesota.
[01:35:24.715 --> 01:35:29.676]  Attacks come as state Democrats suspend staffer for beheading post.
[01:35:29.676 --> 01:35:37.458]  Minnesota Democratic Party has suspended a spokesman for calling for violence against Republicans, even as two GOP candidates have been assaulted and suspected of politically motivated attacks.
[01:35:37.458 --> 01:35:45.420]  And remember, you had the editor of Raw Story, when Congressman Scalise, who barely survived the shooting, where they tried to kill 17 members of the Republican Conservative Caucus,
[01:35:46.305 --> 01:35:48.986]  That would have really thrown things in a disarray if he'd been successful.
[01:35:48.986 --> 01:35:52.908]  He was screaming, you're gonna kill me taking my health care away, because he heard that on the news.
[01:35:52.908 --> 01:35:54.708]  And CNN said the guy was a hero.
[01:35:54.708 --> 01:35:56.369]  Remember that?
[01:35:56.369 --> 01:36:05.713]  And now, the head of Raw Story, one of the main editors said, weird self-defense for shooting Scalise.
[01:36:05.713 --> 01:36:16.057]  The Democratic Farmer Labor Party has suspended communications staffer William Davis for a week without being paid for making a Facebook post joking that Democrats would bring Republicans to the guillotine.
[01:36:17.006 --> 01:36:20.607]  November 17th, the day after the midterm elections.
[01:36:20.607 --> 01:36:28.529]  You know, the big Trotskyite neocon, Crystal, is on record telling people that we're going to be sent to guillotines and stuff.
[01:36:28.529 --> 01:36:37.591]  Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Jennifer Carnahan said the suspension was not enough, calling for immediate firing in the aftermath of a separate attack against Republican candidates.
[01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:43.233]  She said she has been subjected to numerous death threats during her tenure as the party leader, and the death threats are no laughing matter.
[01:36:44.838 --> 01:36:50.442]  And then it gets into the violent attacks and all the rest of it, and people say, we're going to kill you.
[01:36:50.442 --> 01:36:51.843]  So that's who these people are.
[01:36:51.843 --> 01:36:54.365]  They want to bully everybody.
[01:36:54.365 --> 01:37:05.234]  Meanwhile, they got medical reports and police reports about, you know, the favorite guy they've got there in Minnesota, who's a Democrat, Keith Ellison.
[01:37:05.234 --> 01:37:08.396]  But because there's so much evidence, well, you're not going to hear a thing out of them.
[01:37:08.396 --> 01:37:13.160]  Just like Hillary came out and defended Bill Clinton and said it was consensual and that, you know,
[01:37:15.546 --> 01:37:18.447]  Because Monica Lewinsky was a grown woman, it's okay.
[01:37:18.447 --> 01:37:28.810]  But you say somebody over a woman, hitting on them is bad, which, I think it's consensual it's not, but I think putting pressure on somebody you're over, be it male or female, is bad.
[01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:39.113]  But, the idea that Bill Clinton, all his rapes he's settled, and all the rest of it, is okay, is not okay, and it just shows how hypocritical and out of control these people are.
[01:37:39.113 --> 01:37:40.733]  But speaking of Peto O'Rourke,
[01:37:42.577 --> 01:37:44.540]  I'm sorry, it's Beta O'Rourke.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.601]  I miss his name.
[01:37:45.601 --> 01:37:50.628]  When you got a name like Beta, it's easier to say Pito O'Rourke or... Wait a minute.
[01:37:50.628 --> 01:37:51.670]  Wait.
[01:37:51.670 --> 01:37:53.612]  It's not Beta O'Rourke?
[01:37:53.612 --> 01:37:54.854]  It's not Pito O'Rourke?
[01:37:54.854 --> 01:37:56.436]  Oh, it's Bito!
[01:37:56.436 --> 01:37:58.800]  Pito?
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.561]  Pito O'Rourke!
[01:38:00.592 --> 01:38:03.134]  Well, I'm having a problem with my transmitter then.
[01:38:03.134 --> 01:38:04.055]  Can somebody come in here?
[01:38:04.055 --> 01:38:04.536]  It's breaking up.
[01:38:04.536 --> 01:38:05.597]  What's his name?
[01:38:05.597 --> 01:38:07.738]  Someone's had like this moment, this mental block.
[01:38:07.738 --> 01:38:17.407]  Pino O'Rourke, Beta O'Rourke, Liar O'Rourke, Chicken Neck O'Rourke, Carpetbagger O'Rourke, Scallywag O'Rourke.
[01:38:17.407 --> 01:38:21.090]  I mean, I don't care if you move to Texas as long as you're not a communist or a socialist.
[01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:22.872]  If you're fleeing California, that's great.
[01:38:22.872 --> 01:38:24.233]  Just don't bring it here.
[01:38:24.233 --> 01:38:25.534]  But when your family
[01:38:26.673 --> 01:38:32.555]  is a bunch of fake Texans, and you talk like Obama, mixed with Bernie Sanders.
[01:38:32.555 --> 01:38:35.416]  Just get out of my state, you scumbag.
[01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:45.320]  But excuse me, there's a lot of famous lies out there, and one of them that you've been hearing since the 50s was, New York City has the best water in the world.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.081]  And you see signs up to this day saying how good it tastes.
[01:38:48.081 --> 01:38:50.442]  It tastes like rancid monkey piss.
[01:38:51.715 --> 01:38:56.596]  That's like Houston's water tastes like kerosene you could light on fire, it's so toxic still.
[01:38:56.596 --> 01:38:58.016]  Though I wouldn't drink it if I was you.
[01:38:58.016 --> 01:39:04.658]  I got a lot of family lived in Houston and all of us that don't live in Houston don't die of cancer early and everybody else does.
[01:39:04.658 --> 01:39:09.499]  Anyways, a lot of famous landfills and things that houses are built on down there.
[01:39:09.499 --> 01:39:15.420]  And so they're always saying, oh, we have the best water in cities that have bad water.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.340]  Well, El Paso,
[01:39:17.859 --> 01:39:22.022]  Has been one of the most dangerous cities in the country, not just Texas, forever.
[01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:33.450]  Since the days of outlaws, where people ran down to Mexico and ran back and forth across the border, it has been shoot-em-up, whorehouse gambling, Wild Wild West, got a bunch of military bases there.
[01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:38.333]  And technically how they do it is they do a survey right around the base and then say we have low crime.
[01:39:38.333 --> 01:39:40.435]  But it has one of the highest crime rates in the country.
[01:39:40.435 --> 01:39:43.357]  But they have the slogan, safest city in the United States.
[01:39:45.555 --> 01:39:47.476]  But it's a lie.
[01:39:47.476 --> 01:39:55.921]  So, Beto O'Rourke, Peto O'Rourke, running against Ted Cruz, what is his name?
[01:39:55.921 --> 01:39:56.642]  Beto!
[01:39:56.642 --> 01:39:59.403]  Beto!
[01:39:59.403 --> 01:40:01.665]  What's the name of the cow?
[01:40:01.665 --> 01:40:02.745]  Bevo is his name.
[01:40:02.745 --> 01:40:04.907]  Bevo O'Rourke.
[01:40:04.907 --> 01:40:06.248]  Bevo O'Rourke.
[01:40:06.248 --> 01:40:07.508]  I'm gonna get it right here in a minute.
[01:40:07.508 --> 01:40:13.692]  Bevo O'Rourke, Beto, Peto, Beto O'Rourke, is a liar.
[01:40:13.692 --> 01:40:15.073]  And here he is getting caught in a lie.
[01:40:16.041 --> 01:40:16.221]  I think?
[01:40:31.764 --> 01:40:35.005]  By the way, I bet that Peter O'Rourke, I bet he's got a wall around his house.
[01:40:35.005 --> 01:40:36.085]  Has anybody checked that?
[01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:04.129]  Has anybody gone to Ding Dong's house?
[01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:06.070]  Or he might have moved out of that one if it's got a wall, moved to another.
[01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:08.192]  I mean, I've got a wall around my house.
[01:41:08.192 --> 01:41:12.194]  It's not that I'm even afraid, but, you know, I got cats, I got dogs.
[01:41:12.194 --> 01:41:15.515]  Cats just jump over the wall, but, wow.
[01:41:15.515 --> 01:41:16.636]  I'm gonna stop getting into that.
[01:41:16.636 --> 01:41:17.596]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:41:17.596 --> 01:41:20.778]  I haven't given the number out yet, and we do not have a guest in the third hour.
[01:41:20.778 --> 01:41:22.319]  Mike Adams, I think so, is in the fourth hour.
[01:41:24.585 --> 01:41:25.925]  We've got a lot coming up today.
[01:41:25.925 --> 01:41:28.906]  I haven't gotten to robot security forces on patrol in New York City.
[01:41:28.906 --> 01:41:31.127]  Prophecy concerns for some.
[01:41:31.127 --> 01:41:34.868]  And so much more coming up next hour and a bunch of other clips I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:41:34.868 --> 01:41:37.269]  And I'm having some fun with Beto.
[01:41:37.269 --> 01:41:39.749]  He wants to rape our freedom.
[01:41:39.749 --> 01:41:41.070]  And we need to stand against that.
[01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:47.012]  So we're going to be breaking it all down coming up and opening the phones up when we start the next hour.
[01:41:47.012 --> 01:41:48.232]  In fact, let me do that now.
[01:41:50.762 --> 01:41:55.905]  Let's go ahead and give that number out now to talk about any subject you want, anything you want to get into.
[01:41:55.905 --> 01:41:57.166]  It's a total free-for-all.
[01:41:57.166 --> 01:42:02.350]  Long-time callers, first-time callers, anybody that was left on hold yesterday when the show ended, I'll go right to you.
[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:04.231]  I'm going to take a ton of calls next hour.
[01:42:04.231 --> 01:42:05.272]  Did a good job yesterday.
[01:42:05.272 --> 01:42:05.932]  It was like 20 calls.
[01:42:05.932 --> 01:42:06.572]  That's a lot for me.
[01:42:06.572 --> 01:42:06.612]  800-259-9231.
[01:42:10.435 --> 01:42:12.878]  2-5-9-9-2-3-1 was the old GCN number.
[01:42:12.878 --> 01:42:14.099]  So you can't call that one.
[01:42:14.099 --> 01:42:15.160]  Teleprompter free.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.202]  You gotta call this one.
[01:42:16.202 --> 01:42:16.282]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:16.282 --> 01:42:16.502]  877-789-Alex.
[01:42:16.502 --> 01:42:16.782]  That's 877-789-2539.
[01:42:16.782 --> 01:42:20.827]  When you give the same number out for 20 years, it gets hard to remember the new one.
[01:42:20.827 --> 01:42:21.047]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:21.047 --> 01:42:21.868]  And don't forget,
[01:42:31.508 --> 01:42:38.292]  It's your chance to get Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday all at once as we try to take our payment processors.
[01:42:38.292 --> 01:42:43.816]  I think we're getting some backups, but we got one left right now, and so everybody needs to get in there at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:43.816 --> 01:42:44.636]  Your payment comes through.
[01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:47.358]  It's shipped out to you at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:47.358 --> 01:42:49.339]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:42:49.339 --> 01:42:51.861]  Free shipping storewide, 50% off on the supplements.
[01:42:51.861 --> 01:42:52.721]  It's all there.
[01:42:52.721 --> 01:42:54.622]  Act now and fund the InfoWare.
[01:42:54.622 --> 01:42:55.123]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.308 --> 01:42:57.328]  X2.
[01:43:27.908 --> 01:43:33.051]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[01:43:33.051 --> 01:43:34.791]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:36.032]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:36.032 --> 01:43:40.394]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[01:43:40.394 --> 01:43:41.855]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:43:41.855 --> 01:43:45.676]  I'm sure it's viable shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[01:43:45.676 --> 01:43:46.597]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[01:43:47.057 --> 01:43:50.400]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:10.925]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:44:10.925 --> 01:44:12.886]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:44:12.886 --> 01:44:16.347]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:44:16.347 --> 01:44:18.968]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:44:18.968 --> 01:44:21.269]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:44:21.269 --> 01:44:28.212]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:44:28.732 --> 01:44:38.555]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:44:38.555 --> 01:44:39.736]  We'll win.
[01:44:39.736 --> 01:44:42.636]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:44:42.636 --> 01:44:49.799]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:44:49.799 --> 01:44:53.480]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globeless may win.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.720]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:55.721]  We need your support.
[01:44:55.721 --> 01:44:56.461]  I'm counting on you.
[01:44:57.952 --> 01:45:01.897]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:01.897 --> 01:45:05.082]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.082 --> 01:45:11.470]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:14.234]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:14.955 --> 01:45:18.780]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:25.269]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.269 --> 01:45:30.236]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:30.973 --> 01:45:34.894]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:34.894 --> 01:45:42.096]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.096 --> 01:45:46.797]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:46.797 --> 01:45:52.998]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:52.998 --> 01:45:56.979]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:57.819 --> 01:46:17.785]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:46:17.785 --> 01:46:19.905]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:46:19.905 --> 01:46:23.887]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:23.887 --> 01:46:25.107]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[01:46:25.347 --> 01:46:31.151]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.533]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:46:33.533 --> 01:46:36.174]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:46:36.174 --> 01:46:37.115]  That's my dad.
[01:46:37.115 --> 01:46:38.976]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:41.478]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:50.664]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:46:50.664 --> 01:46:55.107]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:47:01.352 --> 01:47:03.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.963 --> 01:47:25.005]  I want you to have a great future.
[01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:37.652]  But I see the average person that means well, wants to work hard, and loves God.
[01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:55.754]  Being taken advantage of, I get angry.
[01:47:55.754 --> 01:47:58.875]  And so I decided to take on the tyrants.
[01:47:58.875 --> 01:48:01.176]  Because I believe in you.
[01:48:01.176 --> 01:48:03.157]  And I knew history.
[01:48:03.157 --> 01:48:06.018]  And I knew at first it's always hard to stand up.
[01:48:06.018 --> 01:48:08.399]  In the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man.
[01:48:08.399 --> 01:48:10.200]  Hated and feared, scorned.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:16.963]  But when his cause succeeds, the timid join in because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:48:16.963 --> 01:48:19.484]  It was true when Mark Twain said that 150 years ago.
[01:48:21.792 --> 01:48:22.392]  And it's true now.
[01:48:22.392 --> 01:48:39.164]  I want to make something very, very clear, because the most popular thing that the establishment media puts out against me, they do a lot of things, but one of the most common things they do, and it's not about me, it's understanding their mindset and what they think of you.
[01:48:39.164 --> 01:48:45.448]  The propaganda is targeting you, so when I'm talking about me, it's so you can understand why they want to shut us down.
[01:48:45.448 --> 01:48:47.310]  What it is we're doing that's got their number.
[01:48:48.311 --> 01:48:54.954]  Why this weapon system, the tinfoil wars, the truth, scares them so much.
[01:48:54.954 --> 01:48:57.796]  It's because they always go, ha ha, you're getting banned.
[01:48:57.796 --> 01:49:00.517]  Ha ha, you're getting sued.
[01:49:00.517 --> 01:49:05.399]  Ha ha, you're getting ridiculed.
[01:49:05.399 --> 01:49:12.103]  If I liked the current swamp and corrupt globalist system running America, I would have gone and joined it.
[01:49:12.103 --> 01:49:16.865]  If I was an evil person or a bad person or a weak person or wanted power for power's sake.
[01:49:18.055 --> 01:49:26.918]  I'm here believing that promoting real freedom and real justice is the best thing for myself and my family and your family.
[01:49:26.918 --> 01:49:28.038]  But I'm not telling you what to do.
[01:49:28.038 --> 01:49:29.678]  I'm just saying, let me be free.
[01:49:29.678 --> 01:49:32.019]  Let me have my free speech.
[01:49:32.019 --> 01:49:32.599]  And guess what?
[01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:36.900]  We've been winning the culture war on every front.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:39.321]  The power structure doesn't know what to do.
[01:49:39.321 --> 01:49:42.062]  They want to shut us up.
[01:49:42.062 --> 01:49:44.822]  And they shut me down.
[01:49:44.822 --> 01:49:46.223]  And they start shutting everybody else down.
[01:49:47.327 --> 01:50:09.305]  And the internal polls still show a red wave, and you've got nationalists and patriots being elected every week there are elections in Latin America, and in Asia, and in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, in Africa, and people are going for nationalist, free market, Trump types.
[01:50:11.428 --> 01:50:15.292]  And you don't think Trump invented Americana and Renaissance and free market.
[01:50:15.292 --> 01:50:18.355]  No, he just believes in it and he's a salesman.
[01:50:18.355 --> 01:50:19.636]  He's selling it.
[01:50:19.636 --> 01:50:24.661]  And he told you, you buy into this, it'll be a lot better for you and your family.
[01:50:24.661 --> 01:50:31.607]  And he hadn't even got us out of the showroom yet and things are already better.
[01:50:31.607 --> 01:50:32.448]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[01:50:34.178 --> 01:50:35.518]  So it's the same thing.
[01:50:35.518 --> 01:50:37.239]  I really believe in freedom.
[01:50:37.239 --> 01:50:38.519]  And I don't like globalists.
[01:50:38.519 --> 01:50:39.799]  I don't like Michael Moore.
[01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:41.079]  I don't like Mika Brzezinski.
[01:50:41.079 --> 01:50:42.380]  I don't like Hillary Clinton.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:44.000]  I don't like Bill Clinton.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.260]  I don't like Barack Obama.
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.441]  I don't like his evil wife.
[01:50:47.441 --> 01:50:49.261]  I don't like the Blue Blood Republicans.
[01:50:49.261 --> 01:50:52.382]  I don't like Juncker.
[01:50:52.382 --> 01:50:54.002]  And I don't like Xi.
[01:50:54.002 --> 01:50:56.702]  And I don't like any of these people.
[01:50:56.702 --> 01:50:58.803]  Because they're out to get their own population.
[01:50:59.690 --> 01:51:07.313]  They shut up the economy so the general public doesn't get any money or infrastructure or a foothold.
[01:51:07.313 --> 01:51:15.055]  Only the select elite get it because they do that on purpose so they don't have any competition because they get off on keeping people down.
[01:51:15.055 --> 01:51:19.197]  And then they sit up there and run their mouths all day about how they really want to empower the average person.
[01:51:21.679 --> 01:51:27.800]  America, for all its faults and all its problems, was the vanguard, the end of the first wave of the Renaissance.
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:32.741]  It was us reaching for something beautiful, and something egalitarian, and something good.
[01:51:32.741 --> 01:51:34.722]  Women voting.
[01:51:34.722 --> 01:51:36.482]  Minorities treated fairly.
[01:51:36.482 --> 01:51:37.622]  Slavery abolished.
[01:51:37.622 --> 01:51:50.005]  We did all that, and then somehow they take our strength, who we are, and the Christian Judaic, Christian ethos, and they turn it on its head,
[01:51:53.775 --> 01:51:58.900]  And make us hate ourselves because we have a conscience.
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:13.734]  So the profound thing I'm trying to get across here, and this is profound, is I did not come to the airwaves and do all this to win popularity contests with the establishment.
[01:52:13.734 --> 01:52:16.156]  I came to get you to believe in yourself.
[01:52:16.156 --> 01:52:16.737]  I came on air to
[01:52:19.022 --> 01:52:25.308]  Really tell you how I felt and what I'd read in history, what I'd experienced in life, and that I want to be with you in the future.
[01:52:25.308 --> 01:52:26.710]  I want your children to be with my children.
[01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:28.231]  I love you.
[01:52:28.231 --> 01:52:29.413]  And that's not some corny thing.
[01:52:29.413 --> 01:52:31.835]  I do love you.
[01:52:31.835 --> 01:52:32.676]  I love your struggles.
[01:52:32.676 --> 01:52:33.337]  I love your dreams.
[01:52:33.337 --> 01:52:34.518]  I love your hopes.
[01:52:34.518 --> 01:52:35.479]  We're in this together, man.
[01:52:37.714 --> 01:52:40.655]  And they know that we're collectivist as real Christians that love God.
[01:52:40.655 --> 01:52:42.136]  We are collectivist.
[01:52:42.136 --> 01:52:45.697]  But we're individualist in our freedom and free will God gave us.
[01:52:45.697 --> 01:52:48.218]  We don't need to have governments and systems that run it.
[01:52:48.218 --> 01:53:01.284]  Goodness rises to the top when it's allowed to flourish and then you have a real contest of liberty that empowers the species and then it lifts everyone up through individual collectivism, a term I've coined, which is the real universe.
[01:53:07.776 --> 01:53:11.139]  They created artificial collectivism that is the opposite.
[01:53:11.139 --> 01:53:14.462]  It's total centralized control enslaving those under it.
[01:53:14.462 --> 01:53:20.247]  Slavery is not collectivism.
[01:53:20.247 --> 01:53:25.792]  You look at businesses, you look at militaries, you look at companies, you look at groups that are really successful
[01:53:27.708 --> 01:53:35.430]  They have a code of conduct, they believe in something, they have a goal, and it's all about being honorable because you don't want to have to look over your shoulder.
[01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:53.595]  And it creates kinship, it creates honor, it creates will, it creates destiny, it creates incubation chambers of children, and their children, that if they're kept on that path of Spartan culture, unleashes human potential that is unlimited.
[01:53:55.814 --> 01:54:03.239]  But you look at globalism and the decadent disease it's pumped into our society and our civilizations and it's pure death.
[01:54:03.239 --> 01:54:13.507]  And I don't sit up here on some high horse on the mountain telling you about prosperity produces monsters, adversity produces men.
[01:54:13.507 --> 01:54:24.055]  The paradox is freedom produces incredible prosperity and then the cycle of corruption begins again and if we're ever going to save humanity we have to learn the cycle and learn the pitfalls and learn about evil!
[01:54:24.952 --> 01:54:31.436]  And evil, the devil's good at advertising evil like wanting the hot cheerleader.
[01:54:31.436 --> 01:54:32.997]  And the devil tattoo of the devil cheerleader.
[01:54:32.997 --> 01:54:34.098]  You think, damn, the devil looks good.
[01:54:34.098 --> 01:54:35.079]  The devil doesn't look like that.
[01:54:35.079 --> 01:54:42.824]  The devil's dead cities, and rotting bodies, and flies, and failure, and betrayal.
[01:54:42.824 --> 01:54:45.726]  God gave you the sexy, beautiful women.
[01:54:45.726 --> 01:54:46.827]  God gave you the food.
[01:54:46.827 --> 01:54:48.708]  God gave you the lightning in your eyes.
[01:54:48.708 --> 01:54:50.649]  God gave you everything, the universe.
[01:54:50.649 --> 01:54:51.330]  Not the devil!
[01:54:53.308 --> 01:54:56.433]  And so all I'm saying is this.
[01:54:56.433 --> 01:54:57.515]  God gave us family.
[01:54:57.515 --> 01:54:58.416]  God gave us life.
[01:54:58.416 --> 01:54:59.458]  God gave us men and women.
[01:54:59.458 --> 01:55:00.419]  God gave us children.
[01:55:00.419 --> 01:55:03.665]  God gave us the animals and the fish and the birds of the air.
[01:55:03.665 --> 01:55:06.830]  God gave us everything as the potential of what we could be.
[01:55:08.618 --> 01:55:21.543]  And the enemy ever seeks to shut all that down, and to make you go into their artificial reality, like Zuckerberg walking in his conference with thousands of his employees all wearing AI goggles, hunched over in his world, but not him.
[01:55:21.543 --> 01:55:24.564]  He doesn't let his kids wear virtual reality goggles.
[01:55:24.564 --> 01:55:26.364]  He doesn't let them have iPads.
[01:55:26.364 --> 01:55:36.148]  He doesn't have, quote, bot assistants in his house, because he has free will, and the vampire tricked you to take him into the home.
[01:55:37.363 --> 01:55:42.705]  It's all a big joke to Zuckerberg, walking amongst his slaves.
[01:55:42.705 --> 01:55:45.727]  And if you trust him, you're a dumb effer, in his own words.
[01:55:45.727 --> 01:55:50.209]  So we'll start the next hour, get to all your calls, get to a lot more that I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:53.470]  Facebook's now removing mainline veterans groups pages.
[01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:55.491]  They don't want anybody to have support.
[01:55:55.491 --> 01:55:59.833]  They don't want the nation to have anything that makes people feel good and not commit suicide like the veterans.
[01:55:59.833 --> 01:56:05.916]  They don't want anything for you out in the sea of a rock or an island to get refuge.
[01:56:06.912 --> 01:56:09.073]  Because they're demoralizing us.
[01:56:09.073 --> 01:56:17.715]  They're running a psychological warfare program that the Communist Chinese fund, which the Communist Chinese then ban.
[01:56:17.715 --> 01:56:25.636]  The media, they're funding, in the very Hollywood they fund from their own country, because they're giving us a snake bite.
[01:56:25.636 --> 01:56:26.757]  And then another snake bite.
[01:56:26.757 --> 01:56:33.418]  But it didn't kill us, so now they're pumping all their poison into us and it's not working because we're conscious.
[01:56:33.418 --> 01:56:36.199]  We're gonna come back and break it all down and get into Google.
[01:56:36.957 --> 01:56:39.080]  They're incredible admissions that they lied to Congress.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:47.814]  This is just so devastating, and the game they're playing, and the way to stop big tech, and the fraud they're engaged in that we're so close to, and if we win the power of free speech back in the internet...
[01:56:49.144 --> 01:56:55.228]  Commons in the internet, Town Square, then we have victory.
[01:56:55.228 --> 01:57:06.116]  This is one of the most important critical issues, but first is getting right with God, and loving life, and loving the unborn, and ending that satanic sacrament that powers this whole system, and then next, the stars are ours.
[01:57:06.116 --> 01:57:09.078]  But first, we have to transcend this level.
[01:57:09.078 --> 01:57:13.721]  Now, that said, we also need funding in the third dimension.
[01:57:14.537 --> 01:57:16.918]  And that's why we have products that empower you.
[01:57:16.918 --> 01:57:20.518]  Water filtration, air filtration, supplements, t-shirts to spread the word.
[01:57:20.518 --> 01:57:23.439]  Everything we have is a win-win for you at great prices.
[01:57:23.439 --> 01:57:26.120]  And without you, this operation will be shut down.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.480]  Infowarsstore.com, biggest sale in our history.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:30.401]  Christmas, Black Friday, all rolled into one.
[01:57:30.401 --> 01:57:32.701]  Cyber Monday, 50% off, free shipping.
[01:57:32.701 --> 01:57:34.102]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:57:34.102 --> 01:57:36.442]  And the 10% off ridership stays in place.
[01:57:36.442 --> 01:57:37.722]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:47.249 --> 01:57:57.838]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.838 --> 01:57:59.900]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.782]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.782 --> 01:58:04.263]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.263 --> 01:58:07.406]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.606 --> 01:58:11.069]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.069 --> 01:58:13.151]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.151 --> 01:58:22.879]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.879 --> 01:58:35.429]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:39.673]  Reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.673 --> 01:58:42.976]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.976 --> 01:58:44.558]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:58:44.558 --> 01:58:45.258]  With a Z-Shield.
[01:58:45.258 --> 01:58:46.119]  At Infowarslife.com
[01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:52.069]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:54.669]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:55.549]  No one else has this.
[01:58:55.549 --> 01:58:58.610]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:58:58.610 --> 01:59:00.090]  It's very hard for me to get.
[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:01.930]  It's the good halogen.
[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:04.091]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[01:59:04.091 --> 01:59:10.632]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[01:59:10.632 --> 01:59:13.233]  Bio-True Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[01:59:13.233 --> 01:59:14.653]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[01:59:15.953 --> 01:59:21.677]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[01:59:21.677 --> 01:59:23.478]  So these go incredibly well together.
[01:59:23.478 --> 01:59:25.038]  We have a combo of those.
[01:59:25.038 --> 01:59:26.419]  Just experience it for yourself.
[01:59:26.419 --> 01:59:29.141]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:30.181]  Very simple stuff.
[01:59:30.181 --> 01:59:31.822]  Filter your water.
[01:59:31.822 --> 01:59:33.863]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[01:59:33.863 --> 01:59:35.484]  Best out there for the price.
[01:59:35.484 --> 01:59:36.445]  When I say it's the last run,
[01:59:37.685 --> 01:59:39.246]  I think it'll be six months a year until we get more.
[01:59:39.246 --> 01:59:40.066]  I hope we get more.
[01:59:40.066 --> 01:59:41.386]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[01:59:41.386 --> 01:59:42.127]  Survival Short Exit 2.
[01:59:42.127 --> 01:59:43.987]  InfoWarsTour.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:59:43.987 --> 01:59:45.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.413 --> 02:00:24.895]  Alright, here's what's about to happen.
[02:00:24.895 --> 02:00:25.997]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[02:00:27.597 --> 02:00:30.518]  And I'm going to, as quickly as I can, get to the latest developments with Communist China.
[02:00:30.518 --> 02:00:33.519]  And look, I know, everybody's like, we know China's running things.
[02:00:33.519 --> 02:00:38.581]  We know the globalists use it as a place they can go and break all the laws internationally and do what they want.
[02:00:38.581 --> 02:00:40.521]  But Congress is only realizing this.
[02:00:40.521 --> 02:00:42.162]  The public's only realizing it.
[02:00:42.162 --> 02:00:52.565]  And I'm telling you, you expose that China is puppeteering the Democratic Party and the globalist operations, people at a nationalist level will line up against it.
[02:00:52.565 --> 02:00:57.047]  Plus, they're going to get all the prosperity because China has set it up to totally screw us economically.
[02:00:58.786 --> 02:01:03.107]  So we are basically have the enemy in target right now.
[02:01:03.107 --> 02:01:07.409]  I mean, we can blow them back to hell.
[02:01:07.409 --> 02:01:10.510]  We can defeat the Chai Koms, free the Chinese people.
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:12.910]  But the globalists have wanted an anti-human future.
[02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:15.151]  They've been funding the worst Muslim groups.
[02:01:15.151 --> 02:01:16.832]  They've been funding the worst communist groups.
[02:01:16.832 --> 02:01:18.192]  That's what's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:01:18.192 --> 02:01:19.412]  That's what the globalists do.
[02:01:19.412 --> 02:01:23.093]  They want a worldwide system of destabilization.
[02:01:23.093 --> 02:01:26.455]  And Trump's saying, no, we're going to start straight shooting.
[02:01:26.455 --> 02:01:27.675]  That's what America used to be.
[02:01:29.932 --> 02:01:37.438]  And people are sick of globalism, they're sick of divide and conquer, and they're ready.
[02:01:37.438 --> 02:01:40.401]  There isn't just evil in the universe, folks.
[02:01:40.401 --> 02:01:43.243]  And that's why they hate Trump so much, because he's real!
[02:01:43.243 --> 02:01:50.189]  People are like, my God, you're riding on, you know, Trump's jock.
[02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:52.071]  No, I'm not.
[02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.232]  This is everything we wanted.
[02:01:53.232 --> 02:01:54.213]  We built Trump.
[02:01:54.213 --> 02:01:55.074]  We made Trump.
[02:01:55.074 --> 02:01:56.295]  We built the launchpad.
[02:01:57.264 --> 02:01:58.684]  Comprende?
[02:01:58.684 --> 02:02:03.445]  I know the general audience gets that, but let's be aggressive about our support of Trump.
[02:02:03.445 --> 02:02:06.226]  They're trying to break our will, and I kind of like him, but he's not perfect.
[02:02:06.226 --> 02:02:07.826]  No.
[02:02:07.826 --> 02:02:12.687]  People come up to me, even distant family, and I kind of make jokes about Trump, and I get in their face, man.
[02:02:12.687 --> 02:02:13.887]  I say, what?
[02:02:13.887 --> 02:02:15.207]  You like China running things?
[02:02:15.207 --> 02:02:18.488]  You like the anti-free speech crap out of the Democrats?
[02:02:18.488 --> 02:02:20.408]  You don't like the economy coming back?
[02:02:20.408 --> 02:02:22.408]  Then fine, just keep it to yourself then!
[02:02:22.408 --> 02:02:26.429]  I don't give a damn what you say to me when you just regurgitate a bunch of BS.
[02:02:27.346 --> 02:02:30.649]  You understand?
[02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:32.931]  I don't care if you think I'm wrong.
[02:02:32.931 --> 02:02:38.796]  So don't try to feed your ego trying to make me feel stupid when you're a frickin' moron.
[02:02:38.796 --> 02:02:40.277]  I'm serious.
[02:02:40.277 --> 02:02:42.359]  That's where I stand.
[02:02:42.359 --> 02:02:42.900]  With all of this.
[02:02:50.145 --> 02:02:51.486]  You know, we have a contest we're running.
[02:02:51.486 --> 02:02:54.047]  I just announced today, it's only running through next Monday.
[02:02:54.047 --> 02:02:59.551]  I've decided when I do contests now, they're going to be like five, six days and that's it.
[02:02:59.551 --> 02:03:04.714]  It could be video, it could be, it could be an image, it could be anything visual.
[02:03:04.714 --> 02:03:06.495]  An NPC meme contest.
[02:03:06.495 --> 02:03:11.518]  And the rules are, it's at my discretion because I have a bunch of rules and try to track it all and where it came from.
[02:03:11.518 --> 02:03:16.562]  I just need you to show me the providence, who you are, where it came from, show it's first posting, post it on the web somewhere.
[02:03:17.591 --> 02:03:21.014]  So that I can see it and verify it's who you are so you get the money.
[02:03:21.014 --> 02:03:23.115]  Plus, it's just fun to fight back, isn't it?
[02:03:23.115 --> 02:03:25.337]  But it's good to celebrate it too with a symbol of energy, money.
[02:03:25.337 --> 02:03:26.918]  So you can have some fun.
[02:03:26.918 --> 02:03:30.100]  Maybe make more memes.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.882]  $10,000.
[02:03:31.882 --> 02:03:38.366]  And I'll say Tuesday so I get more time, but it will be announced Tuesday on my show.
[02:03:38.366 --> 02:03:43.230]  And they're pouring in at NPC at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:43.230 --> 02:03:44.891]  It could be a video.
[02:03:44.891 --> 02:03:45.652]  It could be a
[02:03:46.906 --> 02:03:47.286]  Image.
[02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:50.468]  Whatever you do, make it.
[02:03:50.468 --> 02:03:56.332]  Send it in, and we're going to take the best ones and post them to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and play them on air.
[02:03:56.332 --> 02:03:58.493]  And it's going to be fun, because it scares them.
[02:03:58.493 --> 02:04:13.522]  Because it shows how they're a bunch of collectivists, how they're conformists, how they've given up their own soul, how they've become slaves of the system with a classic gray face, archetype, two dots, a triangle nose, and one line for the mouth, right out of 1984, right out of the famous Apple commercial.
[02:04:13.522 --> 02:04:15.344]  And it's so true, and they know it!
[02:04:16.024 --> 02:04:18.586]  Because they're the liberal, cool, trendy, you know, free speech folks.
[02:04:18.586 --> 02:04:22.128]  They're like, no, you're the anti-free speech, authoritarian bots.
[02:04:22.128 --> 02:04:24.650]  And they don't know what to do.
[02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:28.572]  This is the MAGA meme, and I want InfoWars to be right in the center of it.
[02:04:28.572 --> 02:04:32.915]  So your InfoWars-themed, MPC-themed, whatever you want to do.
[02:04:32.915 --> 02:04:33.435]  One winner, $10,000!
[02:04:33.435 --> 02:04:33.976]  Coming up!
[02:04:37.734 --> 02:04:42.617]  And it'll be announced Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, T-minus six, seven days.
[02:04:42.617 --> 02:04:44.979]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:04:44.979 --> 02:04:46.540]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:04:56.581 --> 02:04:58.904]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:07.930 --> 02:06:13.634]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:06:13.634 --> 02:06:15.636]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.826 --> 02:06:23.468]  Hey, you!
[02:06:23.468 --> 02:06:25.490]  That's right, you!
[02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:28.152]  Wouldn't you like to know the story of you?
[02:06:28.152 --> 02:06:30.374]  What makes you, you?
[02:06:30.374 --> 02:06:36.080]  DNA and Me is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.882]  You might be surprised.
[02:06:37.882 --> 02:06:42.866]  I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNA and Me showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.
[02:06:45.788 --> 02:06:47.849]  Turns out I'm not totally white.
[02:06:47.849 --> 02:06:51.190]  I'm also part northern Asian and even some Kurdish.
[02:06:51.190 --> 02:06:53.111]  I'm a victim of oppression.
[02:06:53.111 --> 02:06:55.812]  I used to get in trouble for always using the n-word.
[02:06:55.812 --> 02:06:58.153]  But with DNA and me, I found out that I'm 2.1% black.
[02:06:58.153 --> 02:06:58.953]  Morning, Steve!
[02:06:58.953 --> 02:06:59.093]  Sup?
[02:07:02.841 --> 02:07:03.942]  The test is easy.
[02:07:03.942 --> 02:07:07.463]  Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our labs.
[02:07:07.463 --> 02:07:09.665]  People made fun of me for being French.
[02:07:09.665 --> 02:07:12.366]  DNA and me showed I was 8% Navajo.
[02:07:12.366 --> 02:07:15.888]  Nobody's making fun of me now, or my people, who are victims.
[02:07:15.888 --> 02:07:17.789]  I'm 13% victim.
[02:07:17.789 --> 02:07:19.770]  I'm 21% victim.
[02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:23.512]  Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you.
[02:07:23.512 --> 02:07:25.112]  DNA and me.
[02:07:25.112 --> 02:07:26.593]  Are you in?
[02:07:26.593 --> 02:07:27.794]  Hell f***ing yes I'm in.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:57.563]  You know, usually the son of some great legend is not as good as the father.
[02:07:57.563 --> 02:08:00.766]  Shooter Jennings is an amazing artist.
[02:08:00.766 --> 02:08:10.253]  His wide repertoire of everything from classic outlaw country to this smooth stuff we're listening to right now, Summer of Rage.
[02:08:10.253 --> 02:08:14.276]  Came out like five years ago, premiered here on air.
[02:08:14.276 --> 02:08:16.578]  And boy, they pressured him to throw me under the bus and say he hates me.
[02:08:16.578 --> 02:08:17.559]  He says he loves me more than ever.
[02:08:17.559 --> 02:08:18.580]  We need to get Shooter back on.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:20.301]  He gets being an outlaw.
[02:08:20.301 --> 02:08:21.702]  He gets being Americana.
[02:08:21.702 --> 02:08:22.123]  He gets it.
[02:08:23.041 --> 02:08:39.867]  Alright, in the spirit of going to your calls, I will get in the last segment of the show today, but I will do it to the incredible new developments with Google, and Communist China, and going from lying to Congress just three weeks ago, to saying, okay, we're spying, we're censoring, we're doing it all, and it's a wonderful thing.
[02:08:39.867 --> 02:08:42.788]  It's just flabbergasting.
[02:08:42.788 --> 02:08:47.029]  But then they separately still go to Congress and say nothing's going on.
[02:08:47.029 --> 02:08:49.270]  In the New York Times, ban NPC memes!
[02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:51.411]  Ban anyone criticizing anybody!
[02:08:51.411 --> 02:08:52.411]  Only liberals can talk!
[02:08:54.505 --> 02:09:01.429]  It's so authoritarian, and then they turn around at the same time and say it's not happening to Congress.
[02:09:01.429 --> 02:09:04.630]  It's outrageous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:07.572]  You're like, well, it's their website.
[02:09:07.572 --> 02:09:12.294]  Well, they defame you, calling you a Nazi, when they take your stuff down.
[02:09:12.294 --> 02:09:18.477]  They lie about you in the process, and now, you know, they're saying you can't go to college, even if it's a public college, and have your own speech.
[02:09:18.477 --> 02:09:19.938]  So see, no, no, this is everywhere.
[02:09:19.938 --> 02:09:21.679]  These are authoritarians, and they've taken our
[02:09:23.726 --> 02:09:28.650]  Acquiescence to it is a big, giant, green light to accept it.
[02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:40.421]  So there's the New York Times on the screen of your TV viewer bragging that Twitter has banned hundreds of right-wing accounts for posting as soulless, non-playable, liberal activists.
[02:09:40.421 --> 02:09:44.965]  How dare you point out the left as monolithic, hateful, and anti-free speech?
[02:09:44.965 --> 02:09:48.007]  How dare you say they're programmed and put out insane chants?
[02:09:48.007 --> 02:09:49.649]  In fact, I found the videos earlier.
[02:09:50.691 --> 02:09:59.253]  Because I did that whole breakdown first hour about the brainwashing of the MPC system and why archetypally it threatens the left so much.
[02:09:59.253 --> 02:10:04.814]  If you don't know what MPC is, just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:10:04.814 --> 02:10:13.556]  But we didn't play the most powerful ones that totally prove it, where it's video after video during the Kavanaugh hearings with the left programming groups of people
[02:10:15.057 --> 02:10:19.201]  I will go forth and I will block the hallways and I will go to this person's and I will say this.
[02:10:19.201 --> 02:10:30.510]  I will go forth and I will block the hallways and I will... I mean, it is the stuff you see out of, like, Wild Wild Country or Heaven's Gate.
[02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:38.537]  I mean, this is beam me up, Scotty, hail bop, drink the suicide potion.
[02:10:40.672 --> 02:10:44.654]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:10:44.654 --> 02:10:55.581]  Okay, Chris, comedic genius, Chris, Sandra, Chase, Kim, Tommy, Mario, Matt, Carlos, Joseph, Jay, we're going to all of you today.
[02:10:55.581 --> 02:11:03.385]  I'm going to get to at least these 15 calls or whatever they are that are on the board there.
[02:11:03.385 --> 02:11:04.586]  Who should we talk to first?
[02:11:06.923 --> 02:11:12.467]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sandra in the great state of Texas.
[02:11:12.467 --> 02:11:13.808]  Sandra, welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:11:13.808 --> 02:11:15.550]  Thanks for holding.
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:19.493]  Hi Alex, this is my first time to call, so I appreciate you taking the time.
[02:11:19.493 --> 02:11:20.373]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:11:20.373 --> 02:11:21.674]  Thank you.
[02:11:21.674 --> 02:11:22.475]  Sure.
[02:11:22.475 --> 02:11:26.858]  Hey, I've got my first... I wanted to hit on three things with you real quick.
[02:11:26.858 --> 02:11:31.802]  The first one is I just want to see if you think that Hillary will ever go to prison.
[02:11:31.802 --> 02:11:35.505]  Do you think that Donald Trump will work on that?
[02:11:35.505 --> 02:11:36.105]  She needs to.
[02:11:37.059 --> 02:11:38.260]  In fact, I'm glad you brought this up.
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:50.852]  Mueller has leaked to Fox News and the New York Times that he's going to end the investigation a week after the election and that Russian meddling was not found by Trump and even all the fake obstruction stuff and they're going to basically end it at that.
[02:11:50.852 --> 02:11:52.593]  I don't know if that's true, but that's what...
[02:11:53.314 --> 02:11:58.819]  That's what Rosenstein told Trump two weeks ago, remember, when I said it looks like Rosenstein's rolled over.
[02:11:58.819 --> 02:12:00.440]  Unless they're playing possum.
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:02.401]  But we know there's no Russiagate there.
[02:12:02.401 --> 02:12:05.764]  They tried to even set me up there, and I'm not at liberty to get into it, but it was unbelievable.
[02:12:05.764 --> 02:12:08.266]  So, so, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:12:08.266 --> 02:12:10.188]  I was approached with, Russians want to give you money.
[02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:12.790]  I did contact the FBI, just to cover my butt.
[02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:18.394]  But, this is the stuff that's going on, and it was literally the group connected to Fusion GPS, the whole,
[02:12:19.295 --> 02:12:21.436]  It was the CIA, the CIA.
[02:12:21.436 --> 02:12:28.640]  So, the Democrat-run CIA literally, officially approached me, and anyways, I'm not going to get into that.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.101]  Lawyers say don't get into it, and who knows, the folks who were involved even knew what they were doing.
[02:12:32.101 --> 02:12:35.643]  But the point is, that's the type of things that happen in this country.
[02:12:35.643 --> 02:12:43.787]  So, your question was, because Susan and I got off listening to myself talk about, will Hillary ever go to prison?
[02:12:45.425 --> 02:12:54.232]  If they roll over and go into abstentia and maroon her somewhere in the Phantom Zone, if she would just leave, that would be good.
[02:12:54.232 --> 02:12:58.876]  Because if we fight her to the political death, she may keep trying to sabotage the country.
[02:12:58.876 --> 02:12:59.977]  But I don't think she'll take that high road.
[02:12:59.977 --> 02:13:00.938]  I don't think she'll ever go away.
[02:13:00.938 --> 02:13:05.562]  And I think Trump's pledge, he's followed through on all his pledges so far that he's been able to execute.
[02:13:06.002 --> 02:13:08.683]  And one of the ones he hasn't gotten done yet is Hillary for prison.
[02:13:08.683 --> 02:13:16.505]  And that entire deep state group that sold out the Communist China and others deserve to be given the punishment for high treason.
[02:13:16.505 --> 02:13:19.186]  What do you think?
[02:13:19.186 --> 02:13:22.627]  Well, I mean, it's something I think about on a daily basis.
[02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:28.469]  And I'm always, I tuned in on your show like starting in 2016.
[02:13:28.469 --> 02:13:31.270]  And I've just, I've thought about it so much.
[02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:34.671]  And it just, she insults my intelligence on a daily basis.
[02:13:35.726 --> 02:13:42.771]  And it just, it drives me nuts that she's out there saying the things that she does and getting away with it.
[02:13:42.771 --> 02:13:44.312]  It really bothers me.
[02:13:44.312 --> 02:13:44.773]  No, I agree.
[02:13:44.773 --> 02:13:46.654]  And that sends a message of arrogance.
[02:13:46.654 --> 02:13:54.940]  But Trump at the next level, look at Strzok acting like he's auditioning to play the Wicked Witch of the East when he's in there in front of Congress making little weird,
[02:13:56.181 --> 02:13:59.302]  Yes, and it does feel like a criminal network.
[02:13:59.302 --> 02:14:00.022]  It really does.
[02:14:00.022 --> 02:14:01.083]  It feels like they're the mafia.
[02:14:01.083 --> 02:14:02.803]  I mean, I think about that a lot.
[02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:28.356]  This feels like there's something very evil going on in the world.
[02:14:28.356 --> 02:14:32.282]  Well Sandra, what you're saying is, and I forget who said it, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:14:33.174 --> 02:14:36.417]  And I also get, like, Napoleon gives up, send him to this island.
[02:14:36.417 --> 02:14:38.179]  Then he snuck off the island and started another war.
[02:14:38.179 --> 02:14:40.921]  And then they sent him back to another island.
[02:14:40.921 --> 02:14:43.804]  But it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:14:43.804 --> 02:14:47.788]  Powerful evil people, you want to just have them go away, but the Romans were smart.
[02:14:47.788 --> 02:14:50.970]  They would make people go into, you know, a small province and be a governor.
[02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:55.374]  If they got in trouble or did something, they would just send them away, because then they wouldn't fight to the death.
[02:14:55.374 --> 02:14:57.717]  They didn't give Caesar that chance, so he did fight to the death.
[02:14:58.177 --> 02:15:05.220]  And of course, one for a while, but it's a complex issue, and I don't think Hillary Clinton's long for this world.
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:08.922]  I mean, she looks like a reanimated corpse dragging along.
[02:15:08.922 --> 02:15:15.404]  I'd give her... I think Hillary Clinton's got maximum, with even top doctors, two, three years.
[02:15:15.404 --> 02:15:20.267]  Well, I guess I hope he does get her in prison.
[02:15:20.267 --> 02:15:24.428]  But I wanted to tell you, I have an idea also that's off the topic.
[02:15:24.428 --> 02:15:25.429]  I told you I had three things.
[02:15:25.429 --> 02:15:25.929]  Real quick,
[02:15:26.851 --> 02:15:44.006]  The other is I had an idea for a platform for you because you got knocked off of Twitter, and this might sound stupid, but instead of calling it InfoWars, make it like your little icon would be the lion head, and you'd be called InfoWars.
[02:15:44.006 --> 02:15:45.868]  And I don't know how to build a platform.
[02:15:45.868 --> 02:15:47.329]  If I could, I would work on it.
[02:15:47.329 --> 02:15:49.591]  That is a super good idea.
[02:15:49.591 --> 02:15:52.113]  We're trying to develop a lot of stuff like that, so God bless you.
[02:15:52.113 --> 02:15:52.854]  Thank you, Sandra.

[02:19:06.047 --> 02:19:10.752]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[02:20:09.372 --> 02:20:12.074]  NPC Warfare.
[02:20:12.074 --> 02:20:15.577]  The New York Times says, thank God Twitter's banned.
[02:20:15.577 --> 02:20:18.759]  You can't let those Americans put great faces on people.
[02:20:18.759 --> 02:20:21.621]  It's racist.
[02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:31.969]  Our own crew member, Lewis, put together this NPC, the new dreaded meme, the globalist tape, found out more at Infowars.com, over the faces of Hollywood gun grabbers.
[02:20:33.215 --> 02:20:38.597]  It's a long way to the top if you want to take our guns, scumbags.

[02:20:51.869 --> 02:20:53.390]  How many more classrooms?
[02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:55.271]  How many more movie theaters?
[02:20:55.271 --> 02:20:57.453]  How many more houses of faith?
[02:20:57.453 --> 02:20:59.194]  How many more shopping malls?
[02:20:59.194 --> 02:21:01.095]  How many more street corners?
[02:21:01.095 --> 02:21:01.956]  How many more?
[02:21:01.956 --> 02:21:03.117]  How many more?
[02:21:03.117 --> 02:21:03.977]  Enough.
[02:21:03.977 --> 02:21:04.778]  Enough.
[02:21:04.778 --> 02:21:05.818]  Enough.
[02:21:05.818 --> 02:21:06.939]  Enough.
[02:21:06.939 --> 02:21:08.440]  Demand a plan.
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.741]  Right now.
[02:21:09.741 --> 02:21:10.702]  As a mom.
[02:21:10.702 --> 02:21:11.802]  As a dad.
[02:21:11.802 --> 02:21:12.943]  As a friend.
[02:21:12.943 --> 02:21:14.124]  As a husband.
[02:21:14.124 --> 02:21:15.144]  As a wife.
[02:21:15.144 --> 02:21:16.385]  As an American.
[02:21:16.385 --> 02:21:17.086]  As an American.
[02:21:17.666 --> 02:21:18.407]  So, think about that.
[02:21:42.503 --> 02:21:46.186]  The Arab Spring that Hillary and others funded killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
[02:21:46.186 --> 02:21:48.989]  They fund communist China that's killed tens of millions of their own people recently.
[02:21:48.989 --> 02:21:54.974]  And they say no more list of people shot by crazy people with guns.
[02:21:54.974 --> 02:21:59.238]  As if it's all of our fault that bad people get guns, like bad people get cars.
[02:21:59.238 --> 02:22:01.961]  Or all the Islamic attacks using vehicles and knives to kill people.
[02:22:02.654 --> 02:22:03.215]  It's just crazy.
[02:22:03.215 --> 02:22:04.636]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:22:04.636 --> 02:22:06.098]  Take a lot of them here today.
[02:22:06.098 --> 02:22:09.041]  Carlos in Canada, I see what you're talking about.
[02:22:09.041 --> 02:22:20.013]  Fed said the greatest threat is the Federal Reserve, which is the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve that told PBS years ago, former head of it, Greenspan, said we're above the law.
[02:22:20.013 --> 02:22:21.655]  Well, nobody's above the law.
[02:22:21.655 --> 02:22:24.638]  Federal Reserve, Trump says, is my greatest threat to the economy.
[02:22:26.317 --> 02:22:31.998]  His threat is the Fed, because the Fed is raising rates too fast.
[02:22:31.998 --> 02:22:41.220]  And it's independent, so I don't speak to him, but I'm not happy with what he's doing, because it's going too fast, because you looked at the last inflation numbers, they're very low.
[02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:48.161]  And so, it's not federal, like Federal Express, or Federal Ammunition, or Federal Exterminators, or Federal Pizza.
[02:22:48.161 --> 02:22:49.521]  There is such a thing.
[02:22:49.521 --> 02:22:51.322]  The other stuff's real Fed stuff.
[02:22:51.322 --> 02:22:51.902]  It's not Fed.
[02:22:52.961 --> 02:22:58.905]  And it was set up in 1913, it's been around over 100 years, 103 years, 104 years now, hard to believe.
[02:22:58.905 --> 02:23:01.366]  105 years, time flies.
[02:23:01.366 --> 02:23:03.488]  And it's over our country.
[02:23:03.488 --> 02:23:08.891]  They didn't raise rates under Obama, now they've raised them, what, seven times on Trump to try to dampen the economy.
[02:23:08.891 --> 02:23:09.992]  That's meddling.
[02:23:09.992 --> 02:23:11.293]  Carlos, what do you say is going on?
[02:23:11.293 --> 02:23:20.478]  I think that, thank you Alex, but I think this is the October surprise that we, well, we discussed in the past.
[02:23:20.478 --> 02:23:21.359]  The Federal Reserve
[02:23:22.023 --> 02:23:31.930]  I believe has outlived its usefulness as far as the United States of America is concerned, if there were any usefulness to the Federal Reserve.
[02:23:31.930 --> 02:23:33.611]  Let me explain why.
[02:23:33.611 --> 02:23:48.342]  When the Federal Reserve prints money out of thin air and gives it out to various banks to create credit, the banks naturally lend to those that have the greatest credit, so that it creates a vicious circle.
[02:23:48.342 --> 02:23:49.563]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:51.261]  Let's be clear.
[02:23:51.261 --> 02:23:55.343]  The big banks engineered collapses and things to get it pushed through.
[02:23:55.343 --> 02:24:03.769]  Then, especially under Obama, they only gave the trillions of dollars to themselves, to the private subsidiaries that had their own members on the board of the Federal Reserve.
[02:24:03.769 --> 02:24:09.073]  Then they actually cut lending, but then gave the credit to themselves at 0% to buy everything up.
[02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:12.675]  They've been using it as a weapon against us, and Trump knows that.
[02:24:12.675 --> 02:24:13.716]  Precisely.
[02:24:13.716 --> 02:24:14.656]  But let me explain.
[02:24:14.656 --> 02:24:19.720]  The fact is that the printing of money out of thin air
[02:24:20.566 --> 02:24:23.750]  Through the banking system creates oligarchies.
[02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:27.294]  It creates individuals that can amass gazillions of dollars.
[02:24:27.294 --> 02:24:33.002]  Yes, the select anointed groups, the select anointed groups, they get all the money and nobody else does.
[02:24:34.045 --> 02:24:34.465]  Right.
[02:24:34.465 --> 02:24:45.107]  And then what happens is that the individual worker, the employee, the everyday American, is subject to the will of very powerful corporate structures.
[02:24:45.107 --> 02:24:52.169]  Now these corporate structures, they're treated like individuals, however, they don't go to jail like ordinary people.
[02:24:52.169 --> 02:24:56.990]  So that you've got a situation where a privilege of being in a corporation is that you have a charter.
[02:24:57.623 --> 02:25:04.765]  When have you and I seen a company, or a pharmaceutical company, that defrauds people?
[02:25:04.765 --> 02:25:05.885]  No, I understand.
[02:25:05.885 --> 02:25:09.606]  And just like vaccine companies, it has liability protection, so does the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:09.606 --> 02:25:11.266]  And it's a criminal group.
[02:25:11.266 --> 02:25:12.987]  Most of its stockholders are foreign.
[02:25:12.987 --> 02:25:15.007]  There's never been an audit, but we know what it's founding.
[02:25:15.007 --> 02:25:16.808]  It was like 80% European owned.
[02:25:16.808 --> 02:25:17.968]  It is the enemy.
[02:25:17.968 --> 02:25:18.828]  It is globalism.
[02:25:18.828 --> 02:25:22.769]  It's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, that literally is investing everything in China.
[02:25:22.769 --> 02:25:24.290]  They're the ones that set us up.
[02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:25.710]  We have to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:27.684 --> 02:25:31.826]  He needs to nationalize it!
[02:25:31.826 --> 02:25:33.026]  It's called federal!
[02:25:33.026 --> 02:25:35.007]  Everybody's like, well I thought it was already national!
[02:25:35.007 --> 02:25:36.588]  Nationalize it!
[02:25:36.588 --> 02:25:43.270]  Have his, you know, chief economist over there, Kudlow, and just announce it's nationalized and sign an executive order!
[02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.791]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:25:43.791 --> 02:25:46.712]  The Treasury can take over the exact same functions and even leave it like it is.
[02:25:57.827 --> 02:25:58.148]  Thank you.
[02:25:58.148 --> 02:26:00.376]  No more borrowing from the Federal Reserve.
[02:26:00.376 --> 02:26:03.767]  Audit the Federal Reserve and all loans made out of
[02:26:04.401 --> 02:26:08.945]  Money printed out of thin air should be paid back with money printed out of thin air.
[02:26:08.945 --> 02:26:12.248]  Which is what the globalists already do, they only hand us the debt.
[02:26:12.248 --> 02:26:16.372]  They make money on the upside and the downside, and what you're saying is what top economists have said here.
[02:26:16.372 --> 02:26:20.575]  So, Trump to announce plan to nationalize the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:20.575 --> 02:26:21.796]  Question mark?
[02:26:21.796 --> 02:26:22.897]  That's the answer.
[02:26:22.897 --> 02:26:23.898]  God bless you, Carlos.
[02:26:23.898 --> 02:26:25.119]  Great points.
[02:26:25.119 --> 02:26:30.244]  So let's put this out on the internet as a video, this segment, Trump to announce plan to nationalize the Federal Reserve.
[02:26:30.782 --> 02:26:31.823]  Federal Reserve?
[02:26:31.823 --> 02:26:32.984]  Question mark?
[02:26:32.984 --> 02:26:34.565]  Great points, Carlos.
[02:26:34.565 --> 02:26:38.628]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a call here.
[02:26:38.628 --> 02:26:41.611]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chase in California.
[02:26:41.611 --> 02:26:42.371]  Chase, you're on the air.
[02:26:42.371 --> 02:26:49.137]  Hey, thanks so much for taking my call, Alex, and thank you for everything you do for our country.
[02:26:49.137 --> 02:26:57.303]  Now, speaking of your contest, you inspired me and I tried your reporter contest, and ever since I've been producing reports every day.
[02:26:57.303 --> 02:26:59.445]  And one of the things I've been seeing a trend of
[02:26:59.955 --> 02:27:02.436]  Is a huge buildup of militarism.
[02:27:02.436 --> 02:27:07.357]  Now we've seen our own country spend over $300 billion recently on our military.
[02:27:07.357 --> 02:27:11.958]  We've seen Saudi Arabia buy $250 billion from our country.
[02:27:11.958 --> 02:27:16.939]  We've seen an arms deal from India where they're buying $100 billion from Russia.
[02:27:16.939 --> 02:27:21.240]  And this is all showing signs because of the threat of China.
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:24.621]  They are playing the game of risk and they're the only ones doing it.
[02:27:25.103 --> 02:27:28.464]  They're in the EU making deals trying to sabotage our economy.
[02:27:28.464 --> 02:27:29.705]  No, you're right.
[02:27:29.705 --> 02:27:33.827]  The entire buildup is China because they're selling weapons to everybody.
[02:27:33.827 --> 02:27:35.187]  And China's economically taking over.
[02:27:35.187 --> 02:27:36.688]  They're really flexing their muscles.
[02:27:36.688 --> 02:27:45.612]  Hell, I got articles today without even looking from Hollywood Reporter, Wall Street Journal, where China's muscling what movies we can put out, what U.S.
[02:27:45.612 --> 02:27:47.132]  mergers we can have.
[02:27:47.132 --> 02:27:51.054]  Trump, because he's a free marketer, and conservatives don't flex our muscles in the economy.
[02:27:51.574 --> 02:27:55.857]  In a command and control, which is great, but don't let them command and control.
[02:27:55.857 --> 02:28:04.882]  If we stop China and others from command and controlling our economy, or we stop Silicon Valley from letting China intimidate them into censoring, that's not command and control.
[02:28:04.882 --> 02:28:06.623]  It's stopping command and control.
[02:28:06.623 --> 02:28:18.830]  And the vacuum we have allowed has allowed, instead of the federal government running things, and then saying, we run things, you run in America, and turning loose, we have allowed in the vacuum the CHICOMS to come in here, and the EU, and I'm done with it!
[02:28:20.712 --> 02:28:21.292]  I am too.
[02:28:21.292 --> 02:28:25.695]  You know, we are at a hot war with China and people don't realize it.
[02:28:25.695 --> 02:28:28.037]  They have murdered our spies.
[02:28:28.037 --> 02:28:30.058]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:28:30.058 --> 02:28:31.959]  Yeah, I know they're just murdering people because why not?
[02:28:31.959 --> 02:28:34.801]  They see America's weak.
[02:28:34.801 --> 02:28:37.263]  But something happened like with the Japanese.
[02:28:37.263 --> 02:28:38.764]  They gave them a lot of rope.
[02:28:38.764 --> 02:28:41.305]  And that's a British thing.
[02:28:41.305 --> 02:28:43.747]  And we're kind of like the British Empire now.
[02:28:43.747 --> 02:28:47.029]  So a lot of this is, and I don't want this to happen, it's a lot of it's playing possum.
[02:28:48.107 --> 02:28:50.852]  I think at the end of the day, the Chi-Coms are gonna get destroyed.
[02:28:55.506 --> 02:28:56.727]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.727 --> 02:29:00.650]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:02.191]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.191 --> 02:29:05.154]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.154 --> 02:29:10.718]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.718 --> 02:29:11.919]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.919 --> 02:29:14.841]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.841 --> 02:29:17.063]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:30:56.215 --> 02:31:01.076]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:31:01.076 --> 02:31:09.979]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:31:09.979 --> 02:31:15.321]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:31:23.703 --> 02:31:24.023]  I think so.

[02:32:59.831 --> 02:33:02.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.678 --> 02:33:24.164]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.422 --> 02:33:42.108]  All I can say to the globalists is, get some, get some, get some, because you're getting it.
[02:33:42.108 --> 02:33:44.292]  And you're getting it good, and we're winning all over the world.
[02:33:44.292 --> 02:33:47.256]  It's gonna be painful for those of us at the tip of the spear.
[02:33:48.629 --> 02:33:51.750]  But what's more painful is living on our knees as slaves.
[02:33:51.750 --> 02:34:12.055]  Here's the video from more than 10 years ago, about 11 years ago, the Lair News Hour, used to be the McNeil Lair News Hour, on PBS, Rockefeller Broadcasting, with the, recently at the time, departed head of the private run-for-profit, Federal Reserve, saying it's above the law, separate from all three branches.
[02:34:12.055 --> 02:34:16.596]  Now, the other three branches of government watch and confirm each other and keep them in the balance.
[02:34:17.421 --> 02:34:22.804]  But the Fed, established in 1913, says it is an equal, separate branch.
[02:34:22.804 --> 02:34:29.509]  Well, if the President was totally separate, and he didn't have impeachment hanging over his head, he would be a dictator.
[02:34:29.509 --> 02:34:30.889]  Unless he just stepped down.
[02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:34.472]  And it'd be the same thing for judges or members of Congress.
[02:34:34.472 --> 02:34:43.037]  Imagine what a flagrant, arrogant statement this is, and somehow they've convinced Trump
[02:34:44.994 --> 02:34:49.018]  That the Federal Reserve is separate so that he has no power over it.
[02:34:49.018 --> 02:34:54.284]  He could nationalize it in 10 seconds flat under the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[02:34:54.284 --> 02:34:56.406]  He could say, you're a corporation, you're no longer needed.
[02:34:56.406 --> 02:35:01.071]  We take it under advisement that the Federal Reserve Act, but that doesn't matter.
[02:35:01.071 --> 02:35:02.972]  Under a national emergency, the Treasury now
[02:35:03.533 --> 02:35:06.035]  We'll oversee all this and I will make the decisions.
[02:35:06.035 --> 02:35:11.279]  If Federal Reserve heads seek to stay in their positions at the 12 Federal Reserve banks, you can do that.
[02:35:11.279 --> 02:35:17.604]  And by the way, most of them don't even like the New York Fed that actually runs it and has a private corporation that owns it that's super secret.
[02:35:17.604 --> 02:35:23.769]  Most of the Fed heads in Dallas and Kansas City and other areas and Atlanta are actually like Trump patriots.
[02:35:24.778 --> 02:35:27.840]  So, it's not the banking system itself that's bad.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.841]  It's the foreign shareholders of the Federal Reserve.
[02:35:30.841 --> 02:35:35.063]  I mean, it was 80% foreign when it got set up.
[02:35:35.063 --> 02:35:35.984]  We don't know now.
[02:35:35.984 --> 02:35:36.604]  It's so secret.
[02:35:36.604 --> 02:35:37.344]  We never had an audit.
[02:35:37.344 --> 02:35:38.265]  We pushed for that.
[02:35:38.265 --> 02:35:41.887]  But here is good old Alan Greenspan.
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:58.325]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:35:58.325 --> 02:36:06.828]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:08.952]  No one can regulate us.
[02:36:08.952 --> 02:36:09.173]  No one.
[02:36:09.173 --> 02:36:09.633]  We're just out here.
[02:36:09.633 --> 02:36:10.234]  We just run everything.
[02:36:10.234 --> 02:36:13.517]  Boy, you white shoe boys or something else, aren't you?
[02:36:13.517 --> 02:36:14.978]  It's time for Trump.
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:34.263]  To nationalize the Federal Reserve because it is our financial system.
[02:36:34.263 --> 02:36:36.685]  It is tied into all the private banks.
[02:36:36.685 --> 02:36:41.990]  And I think it needs to be nationalized postage.
[02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:43.071]  Do it.
[02:36:43.071 --> 02:36:43.851]  Take the gloves off.
[02:36:43.851 --> 02:36:47.374]  Stop letting these con artists push us like this.
[02:36:47.374 --> 02:36:49.917]  All right.
[02:36:49.917 --> 02:36:54.281]  Chase, you were getting into Communist China saying, you know, hot water.
[02:36:54.281 --> 02:36:55.181]  Yeah, for people that don't know,
[02:36:56.275 --> 02:36:58.617]  Five years ago, we started getting all the staff at U.S.
[02:36:58.617 --> 02:37:02.821]  Embassies sick, brain damaged, lower IQs, nosebleeds, some of them.
[02:37:02.821 --> 02:37:06.464]  A few people died of heart attacks.
[02:37:06.464 --> 02:37:07.805]  And they said, it's sound waves.
[02:37:07.805 --> 02:37:10.467]  And I said, no, it's microwaves.
[02:37:10.467 --> 02:37:13.110]  And of course, now they admit even The Washington Post, it's microwaves.
[02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:16.553]  Same thing at our embassy in Havana, Cuba.
[02:37:16.553 --> 02:37:20.256]  And China is just super belligerent.
[02:37:20.256 --> 02:37:23.659]  And there's a billion, 300 plus million, they kill whoever they want in their own country.
[02:37:24.588 --> 02:37:35.611]  And they've got all the rare earth minerals, they've got more than half the trade in the world, they've been positioned and given everything because David Rockefeller went in there and set the deal up 40-something years ago.
[02:37:35.611 --> 02:37:46.715]  So I think it's time, and Trump's doing that, to let them know that the piss on America party is over.
[02:37:46.715 --> 02:37:47.195]  That it's over.
[02:37:48.834 --> 02:37:52.655]  But again, you learned about microwave weapons 20 years ago here on air.
[02:37:52.655 --> 02:37:54.476]  Even national stories demonize me talking about it.
[02:37:54.476 --> 02:37:56.016]  It's a fact, but I digress.
[02:37:56.016 --> 02:37:59.537]  Go ahead and finish your point, Chase.
[02:37:59.537 --> 02:38:05.139]  Yeah, you mentioned the sonic weapons, and that's a very real threat that just kind of started to hit the news.
[02:38:05.139 --> 02:38:07.179]  Mike Pompeo was talking about that.
[02:38:07.179 --> 02:38:16.882]  But on my site, on YouTube, Chase the Patriot, I have a number of videos, including just this week, we saw that hypersonic nuclear weapon test in China.
[02:38:17.407 --> 02:38:17.747]  I think so.
[02:38:36.946 --> 02:38:40.068]  And there are more Chinese flags in Africa today.
[02:38:40.068 --> 02:38:41.089]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:38:41.089 --> 02:38:46.573]  And again, the globalists, let's explain, the globalists set it up to position China to do that because it's a dictatorship.
[02:38:46.573 --> 02:38:48.014]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:48.014 --> 02:38:54.418]  So it's a shell out by our elites, the CFR, the Chinese century, the Dragon century.
[02:38:54.418 --> 02:38:54.959]  And guess what?
[02:38:54.959 --> 02:38:57.601]  The Dragon century is dead on arrival.
[02:38:57.601 --> 02:39:02.024]  But not sonic weapons, microwave weapons.
[02:39:07.805 --> 02:39:09.405]  All right, let's go back to the calls here.
[02:39:09.405 --> 02:39:11.766]  I'm going to do this.
[02:39:11.766 --> 02:39:14.706]  I'm just going to go from the top to the bottom here.
[02:39:14.706 --> 02:39:16.647]  Let's talk to Matt in Kentucky.
[02:39:16.647 --> 02:39:17.347]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:39:17.347 --> 02:39:18.907]  Go ahead.
[02:39:18.907 --> 02:39:19.287]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:19.287 --> 02:39:19.767]  How you doing?
[02:39:19.767 --> 02:39:21.187]  Good, brother.
[02:39:21.187 --> 02:39:22.228]  Good.
[02:39:22.228 --> 02:39:25.068]  So last night on Tucker Carlson, he had a guest on.
[02:39:25.068 --> 02:39:31.869]  I don't know if you saw that, who was a previous Facebook employee who had just left the company.
[02:39:31.869 --> 02:39:33.790]  And at first I thought this was a good thing.
[02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:36.410]  He denounced their censorship of everything.
[02:39:37.182 --> 02:39:50.340]  But then proceeded to explain that it's not coming from the top of Facebook bosses, but it's like dissemination from rogue lackeys, I guess, within Facebook, as though they're able to get around what Zuckerberg wants.
[02:39:52.150 --> 02:40:01.454]  And maybe that's true, but to me it sounded more like a deflection of responsibility, and just another example of the lack of creativity from the left.
[02:40:01.454 --> 02:40:04.276]  Well, I didn't see the report, but that's actually true.
[02:40:04.276 --> 02:40:18.102]  We knew that the big tech guys want to censor, but that the leftists they've hired, I remember like six months ago when I got banned off YouTube for a while, and then they said, oh he was put back, thousands of conservatives were banned, it was rogue groups that didn't understand, that were poorly trained.
[02:40:18.102 --> 02:40:19.323]  No, they hired
[02:40:20.543 --> 02:40:31.030]  20,000 Southern Poverty Law Center-trained SJWs and just send them in there in a government contract that Obama set up two years ago that's still operating with billions of dollars.
[02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:38.594]  And so, yes, it's pressure from above and below, and then the executives deny they know what's going on, but really they knew what they were doing.
[02:40:38.594 --> 02:40:43.978]  But you see the plausible deniability that they just brought in the army of censors?
[02:40:43.978 --> 02:40:48.460]  Yes, and all that to say that, you know, you're banned from these platforms.
[02:40:50.143 --> 02:41:07.252]  And so it's a war, and I feel like you need to use your platform and your influence right now to start denouncing these companies, because everybody that's listening to you has a seed planted in them that
[02:41:08.502 --> 02:41:11.023]  They need to, like, separate from these, like, choose a side.
[02:41:11.023 --> 02:41:17.925]  Sir, we're going to try to build a more high-tech, you know, basic message board posting system for everybody very, very soon.
[02:41:17.925 --> 02:41:18.985]  We're going to try to do it all.
[02:41:18.985 --> 02:41:21.526]  I'm just not one of these big billion-dollar companies.
[02:41:21.526 --> 02:41:24.767]  But, I mean, I'm saying they should be anti-trusted.
[02:41:24.767 --> 02:41:28.489]  I've written reports and had law firm reports to the President starting six months ago.
[02:41:28.489 --> 02:41:29.569]  That's why I was shut down.
[02:41:29.569 --> 02:41:31.310]  I've been behind the scenes and on air.
[02:41:31.310 --> 02:41:33.030]  You may have just tuned in for the first time, Matt.
[02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:35.391]  We've been leading the charge against this with Matt Drudge.
[02:41:36.365 --> 02:41:37.066]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:37.066 --> 02:41:39.588]  And I just, I removed my Facebook account.
[02:41:39.588 --> 02:41:49.196]  I deleted it completely at the end of September after, you know, being on there since 2002 and you had to have a college email address to even get an account.
[02:41:49.196 --> 02:41:50.858]  Well, you do what you think's best.
[02:41:50.858 --> 02:41:55.382]  I think it's best to stay on there all over the place but give it nothing but war.
[02:41:56.483 --> 02:42:00.664]  And, I mean again, the enemy has that battlefield, they don't want you on it.
[02:42:00.664 --> 02:42:04.785]  They want to keep you on it or they can condition you and make you give in and bend their will.
[02:42:04.785 --> 02:42:07.105]  But I would do satire, I'd be silly.
[02:42:07.105 --> 02:42:14.247]  You can do a crazy leftist character, I'm thinking about doing this myself, where you're just over the top, hate America and everything, but then they'll probably think it's cool and leave it on there.
[02:42:14.247 --> 02:42:18.128]  I mean, that's how tone deaf they are.
[02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:24.249]  But I agree, the number one thing like Matt Drudge warned us of two and a half years ago in studio is, beef up your own thing, it's going away.
[02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:26.550]  And people didn't heed his warning.
[02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:28.291]  We built our own video platform.
[02:42:28.291 --> 02:42:30.413]  Mike Adams built his, Real.Video.
[02:42:30.413 --> 02:42:33.455]  They're trying to take our payment processors, brother.
[02:42:33.455 --> 02:42:36.477]  They're trying to take our ability to do anything.
[02:42:36.477 --> 02:42:39.719]  There's some stuff behind the scenes you wouldn't even believe they've been doing.
[02:42:39.719 --> 02:42:42.681]  I mean, I know for a fact, I'm not going to even get into it, but yeah, I hear you.
[02:42:42.681 --> 02:42:43.642]  Believe me, I know what we need to do.
[02:42:43.642 --> 02:42:44.723]  I agree with you.
[02:42:44.723 --> 02:42:45.423]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:45.423 --> 02:42:46.904]  Thanks, Matt in Kentucky.
[02:42:46.904 --> 02:42:53.049]  More calls straight ahead and in the latest, the latest on Google admitting that they perjured themselves to Congress.
[02:42:55.297 --> 02:43:03.683]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.683 --> 02:43:05.144]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.144 --> 02:43:09.847]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.847 --> 02:43:14.851]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.071 --> 02:43:35.243]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.743 --> 02:43:39.724]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:43:39.724 --> 02:43:43.406]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:43:43.406 --> 02:43:48.407]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:43:48.407 --> 02:43:51.128]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:43:51.128 --> 02:43:55.210]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:55.210 --> 02:43:59.111]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.450 --> 02:44:09.132]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:09.132 --> 02:44:11.113]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:11.113 --> 02:44:14.574]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.574 --> 02:44:17.194]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.194 --> 02:44:18.735]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.475 --> 02:44:31.918]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[02:44:33.055 --> 02:44:36.779]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:36.779 --> 02:44:37.960]  We'll win.
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:40.783]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[02:44:40.783 --> 02:44:46.169]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[02:44:46.169 --> 02:44:48.011]  And you're right, to the market.
[02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:51.715]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:52.936]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[02:44:52.936 --> 02:44:53.957]  We need your support.
[02:44:53.957 --> 02:44:54.698]  I'm counting on you.
[02:44:56.079 --> 02:44:56.099]  X2.
[02:45:26.679 --> 02:45:31.822]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[02:45:31.822 --> 02:45:33.582]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:45:33.582 --> 02:45:34.803]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:34.803 --> 02:45:36.764]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:45:36.764 --> 02:45:39.165]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:39.165 --> 02:45:40.606]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[02:45:40.606 --> 02:45:44.447]  We'll search Bible Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:45:44.447 --> 02:45:45.348]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[02:45:45.828 --> 02:45:52.132]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:45:52.132 --> 02:45:52.312]  It's you!
[02:46:04.932 --> 02:46:07.115]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.115 --> 02:46:15.865]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:15.865 --> 02:46:20.450]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.450 --> 02:46:21.891]  You are the info war.
[02:46:21.891 --> 02:46:25.415]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.076 --> 02:46:37.461]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:37.461 --> 02:46:45.445]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.445 --> 02:46:52.489]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.489 --> 02:46:55.230]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:59.313 --> 02:47:07.776]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.776 --> 02:47:13.758]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:47:13.758 --> 02:47:17.199]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:47:17.199 --> 02:47:18.159]  He was dressed like 1950.
[02:47:18.159 --> 02:47:19.400]  Half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:47:26.474 --> 02:47:28.814]  Would you like to ride, son?
[02:47:28.814 --> 02:47:31.435]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:31.435 --> 02:47:37.637]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:37.637 --> 02:47:43.038]  This is kind of the country version of it's a long way to the top and you want to rock and roll.
[02:47:43.038 --> 02:47:47.059]  I politically incorrect David Allen Coe, who is definitely crazy.
[02:47:47.059 --> 02:47:49.120]  So listen to a little bit of this.
[02:47:51.013 --> 02:47:52.576]  This is a Hank Williams song.
[02:47:52.576 --> 02:47:54.759]  It's a Hank Williams ghost song.
[02:47:54.759 --> 02:47:55.059]  He said...
[02:48:05.476 --> 02:48:09.417]  Can you bend them guitar strings?
[02:48:09.417 --> 02:48:12.578]  Big Star Bound, let me warn you, it's a long, hard ride.
[02:48:12.578 --> 02:48:14.298]  Did you cry south of Nashville?
[02:48:14.298 --> 02:48:15.939]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:48:32.639 --> 02:48:36.522]  I want to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to start the next hour before Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:48:36.522 --> 02:48:39.905]  I thought it was Mike Adams, it's Matt Bracken, they're both awesome.
[02:48:39.905 --> 02:48:41.806]  And then of course the war rooms come up with Owen Schroyer.
[02:48:41.806 --> 02:48:42.307]  Busted!
[02:48:42.307 --> 02:48:44.668]  Voter fraud ring discovered in Texas.
[02:48:44.668 --> 02:48:47.250]  Mainstream news in Texas.
[02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:49.332]  No national coverage I've seen.
[02:48:49.332 --> 02:48:50.313]  That's coming up.
[02:48:50.313 --> 02:48:51.634]  That's exactly what we said.
[02:48:51.634 --> 02:48:57.298]  Then we say, stop illegal aliens voting.
[02:48:57.298 --> 02:48:59.140]  I'll demonize illegal aliens when they're doing bad stuff.
[02:49:00.885 --> 02:49:04.547]  And on average, illegal aliens are not criminals, other than breaking the law to come here.
[02:49:04.547 --> 02:49:05.288]  They're looking for work.
[02:49:05.288 --> 02:49:08.209]  But the ones that are criminals are particularly criminal.
[02:49:08.209 --> 02:49:10.971]  That's why an illegal alien is twice as likely than any other group to commit a crime.
[02:49:10.971 --> 02:49:12.272]  Because what have you got to lose?
[02:49:12.272 --> 02:49:13.453]  Plus, you have anonymity.
[02:49:13.453 --> 02:49:14.853]  It's almost like a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[02:49:14.853 --> 02:49:18.216]  But it's not illegal aliens voting.
[02:49:18.216 --> 02:49:21.458]  It's Democrats with lists of dead people that are still in the voter rolls.
[02:49:21.458 --> 02:49:22.058]  And that's right here.
[02:49:26.792 --> 02:49:31.614]  So I'm not Mr. White Knight defending the illegal aliens here with the anchor babies and all of it.
[02:49:31.614 --> 02:49:32.454]  I don't care where you came from.
[02:49:32.454 --> 02:49:34.555]  Eastern Europe, China, Mexico, whatever.
[02:49:34.555 --> 02:49:36.056]  But it's not the illegal aliens.
[02:49:36.056 --> 02:49:38.997]  That's why Obama had to go on TV two years ago and say...
[02:49:40.202 --> 02:49:41.863]  Doesn't matter if you're here or you should vote.
[02:49:41.863 --> 02:49:48.785]  While the Democrats try to say it's legal now if you're an illegal vote, the Mexicans and Latin Americans don't show up and vote illegally.
[02:49:48.785 --> 02:49:52.806]  They have a sense of like, that's criminal, I'm not a citizen yet, I'm not going to do it.
[02:49:52.806 --> 02:49:59.848]  But they got the winos and the drunks, and they're Mexican, they're black, they're white, they're whatever, and man, they're in there voting big time.
[02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:03.932]  And we got Project Veritas' undercover video.
[02:50:03.932 --> 02:50:05.974]  It's well-known the Democrats do this.
[02:50:05.974 --> 02:50:08.736]  On average, they give them beer, whiskey, you name it.
[02:50:08.736 --> 02:50:09.616]  They get them on buses.
[02:50:09.616 --> 02:50:12.138]  They try to not give them too much alcohol up front.
[02:50:12.138 --> 02:50:14.200]  Some of them want other drugs.
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:24.488]  And on average, they vote 10 times in states that don't have voter ID.
[02:50:24.488 --> 02:50:29.452]  But they do it in Texas, even though we have voter ID, because they do it with absentee ballots.
[02:50:30.549 --> 02:50:33.472]  See, I always say I'm going to get to it and I get to it right up front.
[02:50:33.472 --> 02:50:35.413]  I'm not the guy that has cliffhangers.
[02:50:35.413 --> 02:50:37.055]  Let's go ahead and go to this report right now.
[02:50:37.055 --> 02:50:37.895]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:50:37.895 --> 02:50:39.797]  I'm going to have it retweeted.
[02:50:39.797 --> 02:50:41.719]  I'd like to ask Watson to retweet it.
[02:50:41.719 --> 02:50:44.601]  This needs to get out.
[02:50:44.601 --> 02:50:49.225]  We'll go to your calls, Joseph and Tommy and Chris and Comedic Genius.
[02:50:49.225 --> 02:50:52.848]  We're going to get to you and Marco and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[02:50:52.848 --> 02:50:57.752]  But here is at least part of this report from Texas News.
[02:50:58.854 --> 02:50:59.555]  What is this, CBS?
[02:50:59.555 --> 02:51:00.656]  It's also on NBC.
[02:51:00.656 --> 02:51:02.017]  Here it is.
[02:51:02.017 --> 02:51:06.140]  Women are accused of being part of a paid voter fraud ring in Tarrant County.
[02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:10.524]  Tonight, they faced dozens of felony charges connected to mail-in ballots.
[02:51:10.524 --> 02:51:12.346]  Jason Allen live in Fort Worth tonight.
[02:51:12.346 --> 02:51:14.748]  And Jason, this goes back to the primary election in 2016.
[02:51:18.548 --> 02:51:25.397]  Right Gilma, in that spring there were more than 16,000 ballots that were mailed in here to the Tarrant County Election Center.
[02:51:25.397 --> 02:51:34.109]  Now investigators believe that for some of those ballots voters hadn't asked for them, they hadn't filled them out, and they didn't know that somebody else did.
[02:51:36.121 --> 02:51:47.009]  While voters were picking presidential candidates at the polls in 2016, ballots sent in by mail in Tarrant County had what investigators now believe were fraudulent signatures and information.
[02:51:47.009 --> 02:51:48.190]  It doesn't match up.
[02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:49.671]  This was an accepted ballot.
[02:51:49.671 --> 02:51:57.777]  Political consultant Aaron Harris found a paper trail that he handed over to state investigators that helped lead to nearly 30 felony counts against four women.
[02:51:58.277 --> 02:52:07.246]  The women, including Letitia Sanchez and Letitia Tepechan, are accused of requesting ballots for elderly voters, forging signatures, filling those ballots out, and mailing them in.
[02:52:07.246 --> 02:52:11.491]  So the harvesters sit around and fill these out by the hundreds, often by the thousands.
[02:52:11.491 --> 02:52:14.414]  Back in 2016, Governor Greg Abbott posted on Twitter,
[02:52:14.614 --> 02:52:17.155]  About the fraud investigation in Tarrant County.
[02:52:17.155 --> 02:52:24.456]  While the Attorney General's Office referred to the indictments as part of a paid ring, they would not comment on if there would be more charges to come.
[02:52:24.456 --> 02:52:31.138]  Harris told us his own research has turned up many more people involved, but recognized the cases are difficult to prosecute.
[02:52:31.138 --> 02:52:42.020]  And just because they may have only been indicted on one or ten or sixteen counts, doesn't mean they don't have two hundred counts, but those are the only sixteen that can be proven.
[02:52:42.020 --> 02:52:42.360]  Bingo!
[02:52:44.853 --> 02:52:49.635]  The indictment shows that, at least in these cases, many of the ballots involved were for Democratic candidates.
[02:52:49.635 --> 02:52:52.715]  I talked to the Tarrant County Democratic Party chair tonight.
[02:52:52.715 --> 02:52:57.137]  She had met one of the women who was involved, but really didn't know the details of the case.
[02:52:57.137 --> 02:53:03.439]  And she also questioned the timing of these indictments just a few weeks before the November midterm elections.
[02:53:03.439 --> 02:53:05.339]  No kidding, Sherlock.
[02:53:05.339 --> 02:53:07.400]  Bravo, Sierra.
[02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:09.181]  We ought to go find those videos from a year ago.
[02:53:09.181 --> 02:53:11.661]  Battleground Texas turned Texas blue.
[02:53:11.661 --> 02:53:13.722]  They're on video saying we're going to have illegal aliens vote.
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:18.762]  That's a red herring.
[02:53:18.762 --> 02:53:22.444]  They just go to the nursing homes, get all the names, get them out of the newspaper.
[02:53:22.444 --> 02:53:24.945]  People that died, they have them sent to them, they fill them out.
[02:53:24.945 --> 02:53:27.546]  It's industrial.
[02:53:27.546 --> 02:53:31.068]  Reportedly, they get like $200 for every vote they get.
[02:53:32.523 --> 02:53:35.484]  I mean, the Democrats don't know about it.
[02:53:35.484 --> 02:53:41.187]  I bet you all the tea in China and India that these people are part of Battleground Texas.
[02:53:41.187 --> 02:53:43.048]  This is how the Democrats operate.
[02:53:43.048 --> 02:53:44.408]  It's what they do.
[02:53:44.408 --> 02:53:45.989]  It's what the Clintons did.
[02:53:45.989 --> 02:53:52.272]  It's like asking, does Smokey the Bear pull his pants down and use the bathroom in the woods?
[02:53:52.272 --> 02:53:53.953]  And the answer is, yes, he craps in the woods.
[02:53:53.953 --> 02:53:55.113]  He's not wearing pants.
[02:53:55.113 --> 02:53:55.553]  He's a bear.
[02:53:59.286 --> 02:54:00.787]  I don't even know what to say at this point anymore.
[02:54:00.787 --> 02:54:09.011]  These people are, oh Trump's crazy, nobody's voting illegally, and there's all these undercover videos of him doing it, and it's so hard to catch these folks, and this guy's awesome.
[02:54:09.011 --> 02:54:14.153]  I want to get that fellow that did this on so we can duplicate this and expose this crap.
[02:54:14.153 --> 02:54:16.874]  Now let me tell you how you counter him.
[02:54:16.874 --> 02:54:23.337]  You get at least five people you know that aren't lazy but are busy, and they've never really voted, so whatever.
[02:54:23.337 --> 02:54:23.958]  You get that?
[02:54:24.861 --> 02:54:26.742]  Voter registration filed now.
[02:54:26.742 --> 02:54:28.923]  You can do an affidavit, whatever you got to do, you get them to vote.
[02:54:28.923 --> 02:54:31.785]  Or grandma hadn't voted in a few years because her hips hurt.
[02:54:31.785 --> 02:54:33.065]  Or grandpa or whatever.
[02:54:33.065 --> 02:54:38.728]  You take them, you stick them in the wheelchair because you love them, and you love the unborn we're going to save.
[02:54:38.728 --> 02:54:41.030]  We can get Ted Cruz and other stuff.
[02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:46.433]  And you take them down and you have them vote Republican straight ticket now!
[02:54:46.433 --> 02:54:52.576]  We're not going to engage in fraud, but I'll tell you this, we're going to outwork these dirty Soros-funded pieces of crap.
[02:54:56.894 --> 02:55:04.159]  I'm not even sure if I'm going to vote early or vote on the day.
[02:55:04.159 --> 02:55:06.400]  Man, I'm getting angry right now.
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.081]  I've got to tell you.
[02:55:08.081 --> 02:55:09.162]  They want to steal our birthright.
[02:55:09.162 --> 02:55:10.543]  They're engaged in such fraud.
[02:55:10.543 --> 02:55:13.165]  And I'm just telling you, you've got to vote.
[02:55:13.165 --> 02:55:14.065]  They're going to be engaged.
[02:55:14.065 --> 02:55:15.767]  But here's the good news.
[02:55:15.767 --> 02:55:20.910]  State police, state homeland security, and everybody all over the nation is watching.
[02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:24.092]  We stopped Hillary from stealing five states.
[02:55:24.092 --> 02:55:25.033]  She stole six states.
[02:55:26.775 --> 02:55:28.897]  And we're going to stop them this time.
[02:55:28.897 --> 02:55:32.920]  But I just love them saying Trump's crazy, nobody voted illegally.
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:36.783]  BALDERDASH!
[02:55:36.783 --> 02:55:40.506]  HORSEMANURE!
[02:55:40.506 --> 02:55:41.387]  DONKEY DROPPINGS!
[02:55:45.632 --> 02:55:47.314]  Alright, I'll go to your calls for a couple of segments.
[02:55:47.314 --> 02:55:47.995]  Matt's always good.
[02:55:47.995 --> 02:55:48.575]  He likes to come to me.
[02:55:48.575 --> 02:55:50.297]  He knows I take over sometimes.
[02:55:50.297 --> 02:55:51.458]  I swear I get to your calls.
[02:55:51.458 --> 02:55:54.141]  The problem is that they fill up the calls after I hang up with them.
[02:55:54.141 --> 02:55:55.462]  Everybody's been holding the longest.
[02:55:55.462 --> 02:55:56.984]  I'll just go to whoever's been holding the longest.
[02:55:56.984 --> 02:55:57.685]  I love hearing from you.
[02:55:57.685 --> 02:55:59.487]  You're awesome.
[02:55:59.487 --> 02:56:01.148]  Listen, I talked about excitement earlier.
[02:56:01.148 --> 02:56:06.234]  In the spirit of liberty, when you get exciting, nothing on earth can stop you.
[02:56:11.275 --> 02:56:22.463]  And when you get excited about telling people about the local radio stations you're listening to, or local TV stations, or when you share the links to InfoWars.com forward slash show, man, you're not the lifeblood of InfoWars.
[02:56:22.463 --> 02:56:26.226]  Let me tell you, if they knock me out tomorrow, but we saved the country, I'd be happy to be off of here.
[02:56:26.226 --> 02:56:31.510]  I mean, I'm committed, I like doing this, but I wouldn't mind stopping it, because it's, you know, passion is.
[02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:37.995]  You're totally committed, but then after you're like out of the fight, you're like, good God, I just blew a gasket.
[02:56:38.888 --> 02:56:46.790]  This isn't about me, it's about all of us, and I'm telling you, when you financially support us, you are the hand of God in our life.
[02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:48.391]  God's working through you.
[02:56:48.391 --> 02:56:49.151]  I am in your hands.
[02:56:49.151 --> 02:56:51.171]  You know, we're in good hands at Allstate.
[02:56:51.171 --> 02:56:58.213]  Alex Jones and Infowars and everything we do, and God is a train wreck sometimes, but it's real.
[02:56:58.213 --> 02:57:01.014]  It's from the heart.
[02:57:01.014 --> 02:57:07.476]  When you support us financially, you are those hands that save us from the fire of Soros and Hillary.
[02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:10.192]  So, remember that.
[02:57:10.192 --> 02:57:13.014]  And we make it easy with great products at the lowest prices.

[02:57:22.783 --> 02:57:23.804]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:57:23.804 --> 02:57:24.905]  We need your support.
[02:57:24.905 --> 02:57:25.886]  InfoWarsLive.com.

[03:00:05.996 --> 03:00:11.200]  At the end of the day, it's who you serve is who you are.
[03:00:32.688 --> 03:00:42.497]  Well, I want to serve real human potential, and I want an open, true, transparent society based on the animating contest of liberty, not these fraudulent globalist systems.
[03:00:42.497 --> 03:00:45.380]  We're taking calls for two more segments, and Matt Bracken's loaded for bear.
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:48.263]  Ton of critical info coming up.
[03:00:48.263 --> 03:00:51.286]  And, you know, I never got to China and Google.
[03:00:51.286 --> 03:00:53.528]  You know, what Google's done is so bad.
[03:00:55.598 --> 03:00:59.941]  And perjuring themselves to Congress and all of it, and now admitting all the censorship and saying it's good, doing a 180.
[03:00:59.941 --> 03:01:02.702]  Oh, we can't cover it up, let's just hide it in plain view.
[03:01:02.702 --> 03:01:22.694]  I couldn't imagine coming to this country, like Sundar, making $5 billion, or his bosses that have made hundreds of billions off this country, and then DARPA gave them all this, and then they give it to China and piss all over the country?
[03:01:22.694 --> 03:01:22.994]  But see,
[03:01:25.322 --> 03:01:25.942]  They're scared of China.
[03:01:25.942 --> 03:01:29.423]  And they're enamored with it.
[03:01:29.423 --> 03:01:32.463]  So they're going along with it, but that's coming up.
[03:01:32.463 --> 03:01:41.605]  Nancy in Texas, she's got comments on PETA, O'Rourke, I'm sorry, BETA, O'Rourke, and Ted Cruz.
[03:01:41.605 --> 03:01:45.985]  Go ahead.
[03:01:45.985 --> 03:01:47.026]  I'm from El Paso.
[03:01:47.026 --> 03:01:52.407]  I don't live there now, but my family, most of my family is still out there.
[03:01:52.407 --> 03:01:54.207]  And where do I start?
[03:01:57.484 --> 03:02:04.688]  I called into their campaign headquarters the other day, and I just wanted to see what they'd say.
[03:02:04.688 --> 03:02:08.911]  And I told the lady, I said, look, I'm from El Paso.
[03:02:08.911 --> 03:02:11.252]  I know El Paso politics.
[03:02:11.252 --> 03:02:13.854]  And I said, how in the world did he get $30 million?
[03:02:15.092 --> 03:02:20.597]  I said, I read that it came from George Soros, which I think is probably about 100% correct.
[03:02:20.597 --> 03:02:21.698]  Oh no!
[03:02:21.698 --> 03:02:24.000]  It came from little $25 and little donations.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.083]  Well let me stop you because this is so key.
[03:02:27.083 --> 03:02:31.107]  He says El Paso is the safest place in the country, it's one of the most dangerous, that's admitted.
[03:02:31.107 --> 03:02:33.609]  Nothing against El Paso, it's right on the border.
[03:02:33.609 --> 03:02:39.255]  And I mean as you said, and Ted Cruz pointed that out, but yes, he raised $36 million in the last month.
[03:02:39.835 --> 03:02:42.197]  He's raised way more than that last year.
[03:02:42.197 --> 03:02:45.919]  It's like presidential level and it turned out it's all big foundation money.
[03:02:45.919 --> 03:02:47.620]  Soros, Democratic Party, yeah.
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:49.522]  He said it's all little old ladies.
[03:02:49.522 --> 03:02:51.303]  Again, the guy is a liar.
[03:02:51.303 --> 03:02:55.405]  She was a nice lady and I was nice to her.
[03:02:55.405 --> 03:02:57.187]  But I didn't let her get away with anything.
[03:02:57.187 --> 03:02:59.308]  And I said, come on now.
[03:02:59.308 --> 03:03:00.789]  I'm from El Paso.
[03:03:00.789 --> 03:03:01.670]  You gotta be kidding me.
[03:03:02.575 --> 03:03:03.156]  I don't know.
[03:03:22.119 --> 03:03:24.660]  They've had cotton pickers for more than 50 years.
[03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:27.601]  Since the early 60s, they've had cotton pickers.
[03:03:27.601 --> 03:03:30.382]  It's like, got him on that one.
[03:03:30.382 --> 03:03:32.022]  What else have you got, you know?
[03:03:32.022 --> 03:03:36.924]  And she says, well... He's such a joke.
[03:03:36.924 --> 03:03:39.365]  What about him saying his mother's a Republican?
[03:03:39.365 --> 03:03:42.166]  First they got the numbers that she was voting Democrat in 2000.
[03:03:42.166 --> 03:03:45.907]  Now it's coming out that she volunteered for the Democrats in the 70s.
[03:03:45.907 --> 03:03:48.328]  So everything about him is a fraud.
[03:03:48.328 --> 03:03:49.288]  It's a fraud, yeah.
[03:03:49.288 --> 03:03:50.169]  He's a total fraud.
[03:03:50.169 --> 03:03:50.909]  No surprise.
[03:03:51.711 --> 03:03:57.019]  El Paso politics are kind of inbred, you know, it's kind of goofy and people just kind of go along and...
[03:03:57.472 --> 03:04:02.414]  And I'm told the lithium in the water supply, we've always heard that one, they just kind of go along.
[03:04:02.414 --> 03:04:06.675]  But, you know, manufacturing, I taught in the schools.
[03:04:06.675 --> 03:04:12.617]  I quit because I could see where the schools were headed and I didn't want to grow to hate it because I really did enjoy teaching.
[03:04:12.617 --> 03:04:14.197]  But I went into manufacturing.
[03:04:14.197 --> 03:04:18.178]  Well, manufacturing based in El Paso has almost disappeared.
[03:04:18.178 --> 03:04:21.779]  Now they say in the figures, oh, well, this company's there, this company's there.
[03:04:21.779 --> 03:04:24.060]  Let me tell you, I worked for a customs broker.
[03:04:24.060 --> 03:04:26.541]  I saw, we saw it literally in minutes.
[03:04:26.881 --> 03:04:29.102]  You know, leap after NAFTA was signed.
[03:04:29.102 --> 03:04:39.746]  So now what they have are finished, all the companies that are still out there, all they do is minor finish work before they send it off.
[03:04:39.746 --> 03:04:45.828]  Now I understand, they claim it's manufactured here to get the manufacturing credit, but it's really made in Mexico or shipped in from China to Mexico.
[03:04:45.828 --> 03:04:46.469]  Great points.
[03:04:46.469 --> 03:04:47.649]  Hey, vote Ted Cruz.
[03:04:47.649 --> 03:04:48.789]  God bless you, Nancy.
[03:04:48.789 --> 03:04:49.930]  Good to hear from a great Texan.

[03:06:08.686 --> 03:06:13.551]  When it comes to China, given our history, it's a more weighty topic.
[03:06:13.551 --> 03:06:19.797]  Our intent was, the reason we did the internal project, was to completely, it's been many years, we've been out of the market.
[03:06:19.797 --> 03:06:22.099]  It's a wonderful, innovative market.
[03:06:22.099 --> 03:06:26.143]  We wanted to learn what it would look like if Google were in China.
[03:06:26.143 --> 03:06:28.245]  So, that's what we built internally.
[03:06:28.245 --> 03:06:30.747]  You know, if Google were to operate in China, what would it look like?
[03:06:31.508 --> 03:06:33.389]  You know, what queries will we be able to serve?
[03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:37.450]  It turns out we'll be able to serve well over 99% of the queries.
[03:06:37.450 --> 03:06:42.573]  And there are many, many areas where we would provide information better than what's available.
[03:07:05.521 --> 03:07:10.627]  Running down a way of life or fighting many fought and died to keep it.
[03:07:10.627 --> 03:07:14.652]  If you don't love it, leave it.
[03:07:14.652 --> 03:07:19.858]  Let this song that I'm singing be a warning.
[03:07:19.858 --> 03:07:25.424]  When you're running down our country, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[03:07:34.116 --> 03:07:36.298]  I'm going to play this South Park piece one more time.
[03:07:36.298 --> 03:07:38.120]  Elizabeth Warren gets a great idea.
[03:07:38.120 --> 03:07:41.042]  We're going to a few more of your phone calls here.
[03:07:41.042 --> 03:07:46.968]  Google has come out, their CEO, and said Chinese censorship's great.
[03:07:46.968 --> 03:07:48.889]  We're building a censorship engine.
[03:07:48.889 --> 03:07:49.870]  They denied it to Congress.
[03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:51.392]  Now they admit it because they got caught.
[03:07:52.558 --> 03:07:55.980]  But here's the latest South Park piece.
[03:07:55.980 --> 03:07:57.601]  Hey, you!
[03:07:57.601 --> 03:07:59.643]  That's right, you!
[03:07:59.643 --> 03:08:02.284]  Wouldn't you like to know the story of you?
[03:08:02.284 --> 03:08:04.526]  What makes you you?
[03:08:04.526 --> 03:08:10.210]  DNA and Me is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were.
[03:08:10.210 --> 03:08:11.991]  You might be surprised.
[03:08:11.991 --> 03:08:17.094]  I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNA and Me showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.
[03:08:19.918 --> 03:08:21.979]  Turns out I'm not totally white.
[03:08:21.979 --> 03:08:25.220]  I'm also part northern Asian and even some Kurdish.
[03:08:25.220 --> 03:08:27.240]  I'm a victim of oppression.
[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:29.941]  I used to get in trouble for always using the n-word.
[03:08:29.941 --> 03:08:32.482]  But with DNA and me, I found out that I'm 2.1% black.
[03:08:32.482 --> 03:08:33.102]  Morning, Steve!
[03:08:33.102 --> 03:08:33.222]  Stop!
[03:08:36.974 --> 03:08:38.054]  The test is easy.
[03:08:38.054 --> 03:08:41.575]  Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our labs.
[03:08:41.575 --> 03:08:43.796]  People made fun of me for being French.
[03:08:43.796 --> 03:08:46.497]  DNA and me showed I was 8% Navajo.
[03:08:46.497 --> 03:08:50.018]  Nobody's making fun of me now, or my people, who are victims.
[03:08:50.018 --> 03:08:52.278]  I'm 13% victim.
[03:08:52.278 --> 03:08:53.899]  I'm 21% victim.
[03:08:53.899 --> 03:08:57.640]  Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you.
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:08:59.220]  DNA and me.
[03:08:59.220 --> 03:09:00.721]  Are you in?
[03:09:00.721 --> 03:09:01.921]  Hell f***ing yes I'm in.
[03:09:06.008 --> 03:09:12.235]  She's one of the whitest people in America, and the average American has way more Native American blood than she does.
[03:09:12.235 --> 03:09:13.657]  It's just incredible.
[03:09:13.657 --> 03:09:16.961]  Total, complete fraud, but it just shows how stupid they think we are.
[03:09:16.961 --> 03:09:19.123]  But even Politico admits it blew up in her stinking face.
[03:09:19.924 --> 03:09:25.506]  Let's talk to Joseph in New Mexico, worried about 1984 censorship, false flag.
[03:09:25.506 --> 03:09:26.766]  Yeah, I'm worried about false flags.
[03:09:26.766 --> 03:09:35.228]  They just busted this leftist that wanted to blow up a 200 pound bomb on election day to stop the election because he thought the Republicans were going to stop the election.
[03:09:35.228 --> 03:09:37.849]  So yeah, I think we're in false flag territory 20 days out.
[03:09:37.849 --> 03:09:39.949]  What do you think, Joseph?
[03:09:39.949 --> 03:09:41.110]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:42.370]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:09:42.370 --> 03:09:44.771]  I believe you are correct.
[03:09:44.771 --> 03:09:46.191]  First off, I want to thank everyone.
[03:09:46.926 --> 03:09:49.187]  I want to thank your whole staff, everything you guys do.
[03:09:49.187 --> 03:09:50.988]  I encourage all your folks to buy the supplements.
[03:09:50.988 --> 03:09:53.249]  I have many of my family members and other people buying them.
[03:09:53.249 --> 03:09:54.090]  Thank you.
[03:09:54.090 --> 03:10:03.734]  Aside from that, George Orwell said in his book, he said, power is in tearing human minds to pieces and then putting them together again in their new choosing.
[03:10:03.734 --> 03:10:10.278]  And as you can see, the freedom that we used to have, it's being torn and swept right under us.
[03:10:10.278 --> 03:10:14.840]  He said the stranglehold that was on the American people is... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:10:15.373 --> 03:10:15.693]  I think
[03:10:32.617 --> 03:10:34.338]  They might pull this off before the midterms.
[03:10:55.145 --> 03:11:01.349]  You see them saying Trump's going to get the media killed, I'm going to get the media killed, and lying and saying we're calling for media to be killed.
[03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:03.951]  I think that's the strongest indication they're pre-programming for that.
[03:11:03.951 --> 03:11:19.400]  I think that the most effective way to get people off that you don't need a suicidal guy at this point would be, you know, I hesitate to give anybody ideas, but
[03:11:20.504 --> 03:11:32.098]  Just shooting up a line of people going into a polling station in a couple of places early in the morning would cause enough of a panic, be blown up in the media sky-high.
[03:11:32.098 --> 03:11:35.963]  You know, right-wing literature would be left at the scene of where the shell casings are located.
[03:11:35.963 --> 03:11:39.407]  Then there would be a call to halt the elections.
[03:11:40.266 --> 03:11:44.030]  Uh, and then at the end of the day, the elections would be called.
[03:11:57.884 --> 03:11:59.965]  Then the election results would be called suppressed.
[03:11:59.965 --> 03:12:07.708]  They would say, well, all around the country in all 40, all 50 states, you know, oppressed minorities were afraid to go to the polling stations.
[03:12:07.708 --> 03:12:09.429]  Therefore, the results were invalid.
[03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:18.073]  And that creates the outrage mob for a new election, which they dreamed about in the war gaming in Atlantic Monthly for the removal of the president, having new elections.
[03:12:18.073 --> 03:12:22.575]  You're on target because their plan is to stage a civil emergency and have new elections.
[03:12:24.451 --> 03:12:29.992]  Yeah, something I just wanted to sneak in, the last guy mentioned old missing nukes.
[03:12:29.992 --> 03:12:34.753]  And, you know, wherever we can, we want to put people's fears aside.
[03:12:34.753 --> 03:12:39.134]  People don't generally recognize this, but nukes have a shelf life.
[03:12:39.134 --> 03:12:49.677]  The stuff is so corrosive that even the titanium and stainless steel parts around it turn into Swiss cheese.
[03:12:49.677 --> 03:12:50.817]  And every, you know,
[03:12:51.826 --> 03:12:52.466]  We're good to go.
[03:13:15.134 --> 03:13:16.476]  Tell us about
[03:13:35.977 --> 03:13:38.578]  You know, it wouldn't be as efficient, but it would work.
[03:13:38.578 --> 03:13:44.120]  The key is that we have people that can detect these chunks of nuclear weaponry.
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:48.661]  I was about to say, they've got satellites and helicopters that pick it right up.
[03:13:48.661 --> 03:13:49.101]  That's right.
[03:13:49.101 --> 03:13:51.022]  So it's not easy to move around.
[03:13:51.022 --> 03:14:04.566]  And the knuckleheads that we're up against, I'd say it's a million times more likely that somebody would shoot up a polling place, leave right-wing literature, and, you know, cast a poll over the legitimacy of the election.
[03:14:04.566 --> 03:14:05.446]  That's the way it would happen.
[03:14:06.303 --> 03:14:20.348]  And then there's the old standby that you see in places like Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, where by some miraculous process, certain precincts turn in 100% or over 100% of the voters.
[03:14:20.348 --> 03:14:29.631]  And what they've always done, this is strictly anecdotal, I was never in these rooms, but I've been hearing it all my life, starting back in Baltimore, also in Philly.
[03:14:30.262 --> 03:14:38.767]  That if you have a poll watcher who's part of the team, you designate somebody to be a quote-unquote Republican poll watcher.
[03:14:38.767 --> 03:14:40.728]  But there's just a stooge.
[03:14:40.728 --> 03:14:42.289]  Sure, no, it happened last election.
[03:14:42.289 --> 03:14:45.891]  You've got these places that go 120% Democrat.
[03:14:45.891 --> 03:14:48.693]  It's not just like registered voters were 100%, which is impossible.
[03:14:48.693 --> 03:14:49.313]  It'll be 120 for Hillary.
[03:14:49.313 --> 03:14:52.055]  So they have these key places, they really stuff them.
[03:14:53.021 --> 03:14:59.663]  Right, they wait until the polls close and then they look at the registration list and see who didn't show up.
[03:14:59.663 --> 03:15:01.564]  Everybody who's on the list didn't show up.
[03:15:01.564 --> 03:15:04.465]  And that's why it's so dangerous if you're on the rolls not to vote.
[03:15:04.465 --> 03:15:05.585]  You just hit the key.
[03:15:05.585 --> 03:15:11.227]  Folks, if you're a registered voter, you better vote or the Democrats are going to vote your name.
[03:15:11.227 --> 03:15:13.068]  Right, exactly.
[03:15:13.068 --> 03:15:13.788]  That's how it works.
[03:15:15.464 --> 03:15:16.925]  Look, Matt, I appreciate you taking over today.
[03:15:16.925 --> 03:15:17.825]  I swore to go to these calls.
[03:15:17.825 --> 03:15:20.826]  We're going to take a few more with Kim in Arkansas, and then I'm going to let you take over the last 30 minutes.
[03:15:20.826 --> 03:15:24.168]  But tell us with me here, and believe me, folks, I promise to get your calls.
[03:15:24.168 --> 03:15:25.008]  We're doing them.
[03:15:25.008 --> 03:15:28.669]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.

[03:15:35.712 --> 03:15:39.479]  I'm Alex Jones again with InfoWars.com and we're not playing games.
[03:15:39.479 --> 03:15:42.464]  They want us shut down because we have the experts on.
[03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:45.749]  We have the thinkers on who have been proven right over and over again.
[03:15:45.749 --> 03:15:47.392]  Not just me, it's the other guests.
[03:15:47.392 --> 03:15:49.376]  We know what we're talking about.
[03:15:53.436 --> 03:15:55.296]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.296 --> 03:16:03.898]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.
[03:16:03.898 --> 03:16:07.599]  Control your own healthcare costs and choices with Liberty HealthShare.
[03:16:07.599 --> 03:16:09.539]  Liberty HealthShare is not insurance.

[03:16:22.765 --> 03:16:29.108]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.108 --> 03:16:32.150]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:38.073]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.073 --> 03:16:41.875]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.875 --> 03:16:43.135]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.135 --> 03:16:44.476]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.476 --> 03:16:50.679]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.679 --> 03:16:52.120]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.756 --> 03:16:56.338]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.338 --> 03:16:59.900]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:16:59.900 --> 03:17:02.041]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:17:54.298 --> 03:17:58.219]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:08.243]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:18:08.243 --> 03:18:10.224]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:18:10.224 --> 03:18:13.685]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:18:13.685 --> 03:18:16.306]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:18:16.306 --> 03:18:18.586]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:18:18.586 --> 03:18:25.529]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:18:26.089 --> 03:18:35.873]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:18:35.873 --> 03:18:37.053]  We'll win.
[03:18:37.053 --> 03:18:39.374]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:18:39.374 --> 03:18:47.137]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:18:47.137 --> 03:18:50.818]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:18:50.818 --> 03:18:52.378]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:18:52.378 --> 03:18:53.259]  We need your support.
[03:18:53.259 --> 03:18:53.779]  I'm counting on you.
[03:18:54.289 --> 03:18:56.631]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:18:56.631 --> 03:18:58.793]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:18:58.793 --> 03:19:02.736]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:19:02.736 --> 03:19:14.225]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:19:14.225 --> 03:19:23.332]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[03:19:35.038 --> 03:19:37.299]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:19:37.299 --> 03:19:39.320]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:19:40.311 --> 03:19:43.592]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:19:43.592 --> 03:19:45.632]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:19:45.632 --> 03:19:48.933]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:19:48.933 --> 03:19:51.473]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:19:51.473 --> 03:19:57.274]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:19:57.274 --> 03:19:59.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:11.215 --> 03:20:13.136]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:13.136 --> 03:20:19.681]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.681 --> 03:20:25.365]  You know, CNN's running a big shy-off, and others now, they're saying, Vito's gonna lose.
[03:20:25.365 --> 03:20:28.847]  Because last time they said Hillary's gonna win, it embarrassed them with their fake polls.
[03:20:28.847 --> 03:20:35.952]  But they've put so many people out there to buy votes, to have dead people vote, the names of dead people, that they want you to think it's a shoo-in.
[03:20:35.952 --> 03:20:36.673]  Don't listen to that!
[03:20:37.366 --> 03:20:38.687]  Get out there and vote for Ted Cruz.
[03:20:38.687 --> 03:20:40.027]  It's so important.
[03:20:40.027 --> 03:20:42.728]  Whatever CNN says, it's the opposite.
[03:20:42.728 --> 03:20:43.549]  They're not creative.
[03:20:43.549 --> 03:20:47.010]  They invert reality.
[03:20:47.010 --> 03:20:50.171]  We'll take a few final calls here and then let Matt Bracken take over.
[03:20:50.171 --> 03:20:53.013]  But Matt, what keeps you asleep at night?
[03:20:53.013 --> 03:20:54.513]  We're 20 days out.
[03:20:54.513 --> 03:20:55.714]  We are winning.
[03:20:55.714 --> 03:21:00.836]  Nationalist candidates are either winning in primaries or winning from Brazil to Europe.
[03:21:00.836 --> 03:21:04.978]  Merkel, they've had like, what, 15 elections and she's lost every one, so she's about to be out.
[03:21:05.658 --> 03:21:07.741]  Again, folks, they're parliamentary, so it takes a lot longer.
[03:21:07.741 --> 03:21:09.824]  That's why it's a dominant party.
[03:21:09.824 --> 03:21:15.311]  Everything they're doing is turning to crap, but I don't want to be that guy that is like Hillary and gets too confident.
[03:21:15.311 --> 03:21:20.238]  I want to be now, right when we're getting the big, you ever had like a huge fish or get in the boat?
[03:21:20.879 --> 03:21:25.221]  One time we caught this big tuna that we were able to sell for like $5,000 out in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:21:25.221 --> 03:21:29.164]  We were actually, we did get it in and sell it and made our money back and everything for the big trip.
[03:21:29.164 --> 03:21:31.245]  The whole trip was paid for with it, you know, the hotel, everything.
[03:21:31.245 --> 03:21:37.528]  We're out there fishing for five days, but it's like you don't want to count a fish till it's in the boat and gaffed and into the ice.
[03:21:37.528 --> 03:21:42.571]  So what are you worried about as this big ass fish of American restoration gets right up to the boat?
[03:21:42.571 --> 03:21:43.431]  What do we do?
[03:21:43.431 --> 03:21:45.032]  How do we lose this?
[03:21:45.032 --> 03:21:50.275]  Well, you have to factor in probably a 5% margin for cheating by the other side.
[03:21:50.976 --> 03:21:54.260]  So you can't say we're going to win by 1%.
[03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:59.025]  If you think you're going to get it over the line with 1%, it's not going to work.
[03:21:59.025 --> 03:22:00.226]  They'll do a recount.
[03:22:00.226 --> 03:22:05.352]  They'll find suitcases floating in the bay full of uncounted ballots.
[03:22:05.352 --> 03:22:09.917]  So you've got to actually just head stomp them, skull stomp them.
[03:22:09.917 --> 03:22:11.118]  And they showed they're crazed.
[03:22:11.118 --> 03:22:11.999]  They'll do anything now.
[03:22:13.004 --> 03:22:14.664]  Yeah, and their tricks haven't worked.
[03:22:14.664 --> 03:22:21.346]  They've rolled out one October surprise after another, and they've all blown up in their faces like trick cigars.
[03:22:21.346 --> 03:22:26.167]  Kavanaugh was a, you know, trick cigar blew up.
[03:22:26.167 --> 03:22:29.028]  Warren with the Indian thing blew up.
[03:22:29.028 --> 03:22:33.469]  Beto O'Rourke, he thinks he can control the narrative, and it doesn't work anymore.
[03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:39.311]  This is one of the beauties of Trump, is that he's shown how to counterattack and counterpunch these guys.
[03:22:39.731 --> 03:22:42.073]  To not just be wimps like Romney.
[03:22:42.073 --> 03:22:46.337]  I mean, even Lindsey Graham has turned from a wimp into a warrior.
[03:22:46.337 --> 03:22:51.242]  You know, and this is because of Trump's leadership in showing, you know, okay, sometimes I throw in the odd punch.
[03:22:51.242 --> 03:22:52.843]  Yeah, that's the Mark Twain quote.
[03:22:52.843 --> 03:22:54.425]  The patriot is scarce in the beginning.
[03:22:56.966 --> 03:23:12.190]  Right, and so now, you know, courage is infectious, but my fear is that the Democrats, seeing their power slipping away, their Supreme Court Politburo is no longer under their control.
[03:23:12.190 --> 03:23:20.192]  If they are looking at a lost election, even in the lead up to the election, they might do something to disrupt it, like a false flag attack.
[03:23:20.992 --> 03:23:26.934]  No, I agree, but I don't think, Matt, it's a question of if.
[03:23:26.934 --> 03:23:37.036]  If they think they can pull it off, but they know they're being watched, that's why they're badly coordinated now, if they think they can get away with it, they're going to pull it.
[03:23:37.036 --> 03:23:42.738]  And these guys that are willing to go out on the street in Portland and New York and other places,
[03:23:43.539 --> 03:23:51.428]  When they see that they're no longer just ruling the street, that the Proud Boys show up and, you know, stomp them down, they're going to take it to the next level.
[03:23:51.428 --> 03:23:53.330]  They're not going to go back home and just... No, I agree.
[03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:57.174]  You got like 15 guys in skinny jeans throwing bottles at Proud Boys.
[03:23:57.174 --> 03:23:59.196]  Five Proud Boys stomp them in the ground.
[03:23:59.196 --> 03:24:00.437]  The police charge them.
[03:24:00.437 --> 03:24:02.500]  They come to their event to wait for them.
[03:24:02.500 --> 03:24:04.322]  They get their ass kicked and the police charge them.
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:14.982]  Right, but the Antifa types are going to go weather underground, and just like the SBS when that wasn't working... No, I agree.
[03:24:14.982 --> 03:24:16.523]  They're going to bomb the Proud Boys.
[03:24:16.523 --> 03:24:17.363]  They're not going to find them.
[03:24:17.363 --> 03:24:20.304]  They're going to bomb them.
[03:24:20.304 --> 03:24:22.904]  They're going to take it to the next level.
[03:24:22.904 --> 03:24:23.584]  Right.
[03:24:23.584 --> 03:24:27.445]  And they'll probably use rifles to blame on the right.
[03:24:27.445 --> 03:24:29.046]  That'll be the easiest trick to use.
[03:24:31.770 --> 03:24:39.736]  Can you believe the NYPD is going to charge the Proud Boys when they admit they came to the place they were speaking, they attacked them first?
[03:24:39.736 --> 03:24:42.638]  So now if you kick an assailant's ass, you're to blame.
[03:24:45.427 --> 03:24:47.307]  You have to figure this is always going to happen.
[03:24:47.307 --> 03:24:59.630]  I saw a video coming out of England where at a rally, the police, you know, the bearded police in some kind of like auxiliary uniform looked like, you know, Al-Qaeda.
[03:24:59.630 --> 03:25:00.750]  And people are questioning him.
[03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:01.970]  Are you an Islamist?
[03:25:01.970 --> 03:25:05.831]  So don't ever figure that the police are going to be on the side of freedom.
[03:25:05.831 --> 03:25:11.732]  The police are on the side of the bureaucracy, the elites, and getting their pension and their paycheck.
[03:25:11.732 --> 03:25:12.772]  So yeah, don't look for help.
[03:25:13.704 --> 03:25:15.965]  Yes, I just wanted to make a couple comments on
[03:25:43.862 --> 03:25:49.044]  The violence of the left and the voter fraud that you're speaking about.
[03:25:49.044 --> 03:26:03.971]  I believe that, you know, something very like the first caller from Texas is very evil present, clear and present danger and very nefarious people that are willing to, you know, do anything to go to any length.
[03:26:03.971 --> 03:26:06.112]  And I feel like that.
[03:26:07.850 --> 03:26:14.332]  You know, it's kind of like Nicofilia to me when they're using dead people as a vote.
[03:26:14.332 --> 03:26:23.594]  And if that's what we're, you know, battling, and that's what our opponent is, it does take, you know, the power to think that and be prepared.
[03:26:23.594 --> 03:26:29.635]  But the good news is, they got busted with thousands of fake votes and now they've been indicted.
[03:26:29.635 --> 03:26:32.476]  So that's a strong... Matt, that's what's exciting though.
[03:26:32.476 --> 03:26:33.736]  We're watching now, aren't we Matt?
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:44.784]  Yeah, and it's really important if you're, you know, somebody who really wants to do something, who's got guts, you know, that's not just a keyboard commando.
[03:26:44.784 --> 03:26:46.604]  Infiltrate the left!
[03:26:46.604 --> 03:26:48.565]  Or volunteer to be a poll watcher.
[03:26:48.565 --> 03:26:58.949]  This is like throwing, you know, holy water on the devil when a real Republican shows up to be a poll watcher and not a sellout stooge, false Republican.
[03:26:59.469 --> 03:27:10.539]  If there's a real poll watcher there until the ballots all go in the box and get put in a van and driven away by state officials, then they can't stop the boxes at the end.
[03:27:10.539 --> 03:27:16.284]  And it's not just the dead people, it's anybody that didn't show up will be voting after the poll closes.
[03:27:16.284 --> 03:27:21.529]  So having poll watchers in every Democrat precinct is really critical, really important.
[03:27:22.722 --> 03:27:24.283]  And listen, we're not going to vote illegally.
[03:27:24.283 --> 03:27:25.103]  We're not going to do that.
[03:27:25.103 --> 03:27:33.626]  But go get your neighbors, your friends that have been on the voting rolls that haven't voted, or go get grandma out of the nursing home and say, hey, do you like Ted Cruz or Beto?
[03:27:33.626 --> 03:27:36.227]  And then take grandma down to vote.
[03:27:36.227 --> 03:27:39.068]  That is so critical, Matt.
[03:27:39.068 --> 03:27:49.971]  But if you want to be a real superhero in the election world, think about how you could stop 500 or 1,000 false ballots from being cast.
[03:27:49.971 --> 03:27:52.052]  That's really the superhero cape right there.
[03:27:52.859 --> 03:27:58.424]  Volunteer to be a precinct watcher in a Democrat precinct, a poll watcher.
[03:27:58.424 --> 03:28:00.206]  You know, be a registered Republican.
[03:28:00.206 --> 03:28:02.929]  And then if some homeless dude comes in and you say, what's your name?
[03:28:02.929 --> 03:28:04.350]  He goes, my name's David.
[03:28:04.350 --> 03:28:06.812]  Well, it says you're Bill Sanchez here.
[03:28:06.812 --> 03:28:08.594]  Oh, they just gave me that.
[03:28:08.594 --> 03:28:09.335]  Exactly.
[03:28:09.335 --> 03:28:10.736]  Just questioning it.
[03:28:10.736 --> 03:28:12.117]  If it doesn't match up, beats it.
[03:28:12.117 --> 03:28:13.719]  They just count on us rolling over.
[03:28:14.784 --> 03:28:21.906]  Right, and when the vans roll in that are going from precinct to precinct, you'll be there to say, no way, this isn't flying here.
[03:28:21.906 --> 03:28:24.747]  They're going to have to get back in the van and try somewhere else.
[03:28:38.530 --> 03:28:39.631]  We are the most demonized.
[03:28:39.631 --> 03:28:41.613]  We are the most banned for a reason.
[03:28:41.613 --> 03:28:44.035]  Our guests, our callers, our information.
[03:28:44.035 --> 03:28:46.277]  It is kryptonite to these devils.
[03:28:46.277 --> 03:28:47.858]  We have the answer.
[03:28:47.858 --> 03:28:49.540]  We've already beaten the enemy.
[03:28:49.540 --> 03:28:50.941]  And so we need your support.
[03:28:50.941 --> 03:28:51.802]  God bless you all.
[03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:54.730]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:28:54.730 --> 03:28:58.651]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.651 --> 03:29:00.192]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:29:00.192 --> 03:29:03.153]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:03.153 --> 03:29:08.694]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.694 --> 03:29:09.914]  I can help you, too.
[03:29:09.914 --> 03:29:12.835]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:29:12.835 --> 03:29:15.056]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:29:15.056 --> 03:29:19.497]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:29:19.497 --> 03:29:21.798]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:29:23.178 --> 03:29:27.039]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:29:27.039 --> 03:29:32.041]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:29:32.041 --> 03:29:36.862]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[03:29:43.904 --> 03:29:46.385]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:29:54.520 --> 03:30:00.550]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:03.495]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.

[03:30:54.159 --> 03:31:02.549]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.549 --> 03:31:04.011]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:04.011 --> 03:31:08.716]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.716 --> 03:31:13.722]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.942 --> 03:31:34.097]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.597 --> 03:31:38.599]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:31:54.248 --> 03:32:00.492]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWars Life.

[03:32:56.730 --> 03:33:05.397]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.397 --> 03:33:11.621]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.621 --> 03:33:15.424]  My good buddy Shane Steiner sent me this.
[03:33:15.424 --> 03:33:15.925]  Peace here.
[03:33:21.624 --> 03:33:33.618]  You've got a 1 to the 1024th, basically a percentage of 1% Native American, but this is that percentage of Navy SEAL.
[03:33:33.618 --> 03:33:36.442]  There you go, we got the real Navy SEAL here with us on air right now.
[03:33:36.442 --> 03:33:39.646]  You know, everything they do turns to crap.
[03:33:41.209 --> 03:33:50.983]  Matt Bracken, because they think it's the old days of 20 years ago or even 10 years ago where they can lie and say something outrageous and we would buy it.
[03:33:50.983 --> 03:33:53.787]  But now Trump says you're not a Native American.
[03:33:56.010 --> 03:34:03.096]  And then it's a 10th generation, maybe, and they're not even sure, and like the average person has way more than she does.
[03:34:03.096 --> 03:34:04.798]  People are like, no, you're a fraud.
[03:34:04.798 --> 03:34:09.522]  And then Pocahontas' direct descendants come out and say you're full of crap, Warren.
[03:34:09.522 --> 03:34:12.985]  And then the Cherokee that she says she's part of come out against her.
[03:34:12.985 --> 03:34:16.648]  And it's just all the real Native Americans say, this is ridiculous.
[03:34:16.648 --> 03:34:18.409]  And again, it just shows what frauds they are.
[03:34:18.409 --> 03:34:22.433]  It's like, it's like Beta, I'm sorry, I miss his name, Pito O'Rourke.
[03:34:23.376 --> 03:34:24.398]  Is it Bebo O'Rourke?
[03:34:24.398 --> 03:34:25.880]  Whatever his name is.
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:28.684]  He comes out and says, my mom's been a Republican her whole life.
[03:34:28.684 --> 03:34:31.008]  And then it turns back decades and decades, he's a Democrat.
[03:34:31.008 --> 03:34:34.373]  It's like, don't they know the lying doesn't work anymore, Matt?
[03:34:36.633 --> 03:34:39.275]  Yeah, I think his real name is Francis.
[03:34:39.275 --> 03:34:40.416]  Yeah, Francis.
[03:34:40.416 --> 03:34:42.978]  He's trying to be a fake, a fake Hispanic.
[03:34:42.978 --> 03:34:50.243]  So he's trying to appropriate, you know, being a fake Hispanic, giving himself like a little bit of a Hispanic flair to go against Ted Cruz.
[03:34:50.243 --> 03:34:58.208]  But, you know, this has been falling apart from, for the left, at least, and a great example is the whole Dan Rather memo gate thing.
[03:34:58.208 --> 03:35:01.771]  That would have absolutely worked 10 years before it happened.
[03:35:02.331 --> 03:35:03.512]  It would have been unquestioned.
[03:35:03.512 --> 03:35:10.616]  The mainstream media would have produced that memo, that Dan Rather National Guard memo, and it would have been gospel.
[03:35:10.616 --> 03:35:15.919]  That kind of thing worked for Walter Cronkite right through the 90s.
[03:35:15.919 --> 03:35:21.763]  And when social media came along, suddenly there were these armies of online fact-checkers and experts
[03:35:22.163 --> 03:35:25.405]  Once people have a voice, and once they know they're being conned, they start looking.
[03:35:51.306 --> 03:36:02.881]  And not only that, but we can now use Alinsky tactics against them right inside the news cycle because we can make a mockery meme of the 1024th.
[03:36:02.881 --> 03:36:05.925]  There are terrific ones all over the place.
[03:36:05.925 --> 03:36:06.886]  NPCs, the 1024th.
[03:36:08.488 --> 03:36:16.954]  And so in the same time cycle that they thought that they were going to pull an October surprise, it boomerangs back on them ten times over.
[03:36:16.954 --> 03:36:19.536]  And so this is leading to very great frustration on their side.
[03:36:19.536 --> 03:36:25.340]  And that's what they're so mad about, is that we can question them in real time and they don't control the narrative.
[03:36:25.340 --> 03:36:27.062]  And they always assumed that they would.
[03:36:27.062 --> 03:36:34.407]  And remember, their power base, for example, is in academia, where they absolutely control the faculty lounge.
[03:36:34.407 --> 03:36:37.269]  You know, the politically correct witches and warlocks.
[03:36:37.822 --> 03:36:41.305]  They control the faculty lounge 100%.
[03:36:41.305 --> 03:36:45.728]  Then they come out into the real world and they get slapped right in the face.
[03:36:45.728 --> 03:36:47.589]  And they don't like it at all.
[03:36:47.589 --> 03:36:49.590]  These guys are basically Bolsheviks.
[03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:55.995]  If they could, they would load us into boxcars and send us to re-education camps at best.
[03:36:56.135 --> 03:36:59.998]  And by the way, it's not Larry Glothwald telling us that 30 years ago now.
[03:36:59.998 --> 03:37:04.361]  They're all over the news saying they want to kill us, they want to enslave us, they want to take us over.
[03:37:04.361 --> 03:37:07.063]  I mean, I really think they're extincting themselves.
[03:37:07.063 --> 03:37:11.707]  If we can win this election in 2020, bring back the republic, fix things, I think
[03:37:12.307 --> 03:37:14.448]  We've turned the corner on communism and globalism.
[03:37:14.448 --> 03:37:15.469]  Here's the problem.
[03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:16.590]  Then we face AI.
[03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:17.750]  Then we face population.
[03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:19.671]  Then we face... We've got enough problems.
[03:37:19.671 --> 03:37:24.895]  I'm not saying there's some utopia over the next hill, but by God, Matt, I think we're so damn close.
[03:37:24.895 --> 03:37:30.258]  If people fully break with the conditioning and the peer pressure and the bullying, I think we can save humanity.
[03:37:31.445 --> 03:37:32.706]  Politically, yes.
[03:37:32.706 --> 03:37:33.667]  I think so.
[03:37:33.667 --> 03:37:38.312]  We're seeing the pushback in Europe as well as with Trump in USA.
[03:37:38.312 --> 03:37:42.316]  However, there are things that are beyond any president's control.
[03:37:42.316 --> 03:37:48.363]  We could be going into a global economic recession that puts so much stress on societies.
[03:37:49.003 --> 03:38:00.187]  And Soros knows that's happening, so they're trying to blast the migrant corridors already into Europe and the U.S.
[03:38:00.187 --> 03:38:02.628]  to use that crisis for total domination.
[03:38:02.628 --> 03:38:04.428]  And I was going to start the show with that today, but I didn't.
[03:38:04.428 --> 03:38:06.389]  I got into NPCs instead.
[03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:07.870]  And that was the question.
[03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:14.532]  If they're able to plunge the economy, which they're trying to do, which is insane, or if it just happens on its own, then what does Trump face?
[03:38:16.539 --> 03:38:28.948]  Right, because the media will blame him 100% for any economic problems, but I think that socially, the right and the middle class of America is stronger and more confident than it's been in decades.
[03:38:28.948 --> 03:38:34.832]  So I think there's a certain amount of resilience that we wouldn't immediately go to blaming Trump.
[03:38:34.832 --> 03:38:36.233]  Of course the left-wing media will.
[03:38:36.893 --> 03:38:41.859]  But I think that Americans would understand that there are global consequences.
[03:38:41.859 --> 03:38:43.081]  There are global downturns.
[03:38:43.081 --> 03:38:43.341]  No, I agree.
[03:38:43.341 --> 03:38:51.250]  I think if they're able to plunge the economy with Bill Maher saying, let's have a depression to teach these Trump people and all this stuff happening, I think it'll blow up in their face.
[03:38:51.250 --> 03:38:52.712]  People are going to get really pissed.
[03:38:54.369 --> 03:39:05.920]  Yeah, and I think that the timing of the left, tricks that they're trying to use, like this caravan, is probably going to result in a few more percentage points for our side in this election.
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:16.890]  Flooding the zone with helpless refugees from Guatemala, when obviously it's left-wingers paid by Soros that are funding and instigating the entire thing.
[03:39:17.430 --> 03:39:19.172]  I think it works to our benefit.
[03:39:19.172 --> 03:39:20.674]  Their tricks aren't working.
[03:39:20.674 --> 03:39:22.656]  All their tricks are boomeranging.
[03:39:22.656 --> 03:39:26.179]  And I think that they're giving up on the midterms.
[03:39:26.179 --> 03:39:27.621]  No, I agree.
[03:39:27.621 --> 03:39:27.961]  I agree.
[03:39:27.961 --> 03:39:29.923]  And they're going to pull something big probably after then.
[03:39:29.923 --> 03:39:30.624]  But who knows?
[03:39:30.624 --> 03:39:31.705]  Let's see.
[03:39:31.705 --> 03:39:33.627]  Who's up next here?
[03:39:33.627 --> 03:39:34.668]  Let's go ahead and...
[03:39:35.549 --> 03:39:39.570]  Talk to Ryan in West Virginia, then we'll go to Chris and others.
[03:39:39.570 --> 03:39:45.452]  Ryan, you're worried about... I want to ask Matt this too, this thing about, oh Mattis, he's a Democrat.
[03:39:45.452 --> 03:39:47.273]  Is that disinfo?
[03:39:47.273 --> 03:39:53.074]  What do you think that is, Ryan?
[03:39:53.074 --> 03:39:54.535]  I just wanted to get the name out.
[03:39:54.535 --> 03:40:02.977]  If Trump is going to get rid of Mattis, he should... There's this general from the Marine Corps, he's a ball van ripper.
[03:40:02.977 --> 03:40:03.718]  He's retired.
[03:40:05.205 --> 03:40:12.108]  He's just, he's the most badass general that we've had in a long time, and if they could get him in, that'd be great.
[03:40:12.108 --> 03:40:24.332]  Because Mattis, I lost all respect for him once he decided to go against Trump on the whole transgender, because I was a combat medic, and mentally ill people should not be in the military.
[03:40:24.332 --> 03:40:25.912]  Oh, I mean, Hungary's banning it.
[03:40:25.912 --> 03:40:27.773]  It's meant to destroy society.
[03:40:27.773 --> 03:40:29.534]  Absolutely.
[03:40:29.534 --> 03:40:31.835]  What do you make of Trump saying Mattis may be gone soon?
[03:40:31.835 --> 03:40:32.735]  He's basically a Democrat.
[03:40:35.276 --> 03:40:37.801]  I hope he is, and I hope he puts someone in better.
[03:40:37.801 --> 03:40:40.967]  But, like, that just wasn't terrible.
[03:40:40.967 --> 03:40:42.089]  He's definitely... No, I hear you.
[03:40:42.089 --> 03:40:43.031]  I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[03:40:43.031 --> 03:40:43.692]  Thanks for calling.
[03:40:43.692 --> 03:40:45.676]  What do you think's going on, Matt Braggin?
[03:40:46.650 --> 03:40:55.012]  Well, I agree that it's been a show of weakness by the generals on the things like, you know, the transgenders in the military.
[03:40:55.012 --> 03:41:00.354]  That's just practically designed to destroy unit cohesion and discipline.
[03:41:00.354 --> 03:41:02.694]  Well, they're bringing in the robot takeover of the military.
[03:41:02.694 --> 03:41:04.975]  It's designed to spike the military.
[03:41:04.975 --> 03:41:13.057]  But on the other hand, you know, Mattis absolutely annihilated 400 Russian mercenaries, the Group Wagner in Syria.
[03:41:13.817 --> 03:41:20.766]  And that put people on notice that, you know, there are lines that we can bring the hammer down from heaven and we'll do it.
[03:41:20.766 --> 03:41:22.768]  So I'm asking you, what do you think then?
[03:41:22.768 --> 03:41:23.889]  Is it some disenfocus?
[03:41:23.889 --> 03:41:25.131]  Trump doesn't really do that a lot.
[03:41:25.131 --> 03:41:27.354]  He just plays it straight.
[03:41:27.354 --> 03:41:28.996]  Why would he say Mattis may be gone soon?
[03:41:28.996 --> 03:41:29.877]  He's basically a Democrat.
[03:41:30.717 --> 03:41:38.221]  Well, I think that what Trump has been saying is that he doesn't really feel that he's getting complete loyalty from all of his team.
[03:41:38.221 --> 03:41:40.862]  Remember when he came in, he was a political novice.
[03:41:40.862 --> 03:41:44.003]  And he took a lot of suggestions, like Rod Rosenstein.
[03:41:44.003 --> 03:41:45.824]  Oh yeah, there's the perfect guy.
[03:41:45.824 --> 03:41:48.826]  And Rod Rosenstein behind Sessions was a complete setup.
[03:41:49.406 --> 03:41:54.390]  You know, that might as well have been putting Mueller and Rosenstein and Comey completely in charge.
[03:41:54.390 --> 03:41:59.694]  So, now that he's going to be stronger after the midterms, I think he'll be stronger if we win.
[03:41:59.694 --> 03:42:01.736]  Then he's going to be able to move back and destroy all of this.
[03:42:01.736 --> 03:42:01.996]  No, I agree.
[03:42:01.996 --> 03:42:02.757]  Trump's stronger than ever.
[03:42:02.757 --> 03:42:09.422]  We're going to come back, final segment, get your final points and take a few more calls straight ahead with Matt Bracken of EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[03:42:09.422 --> 03:42:14.286]  And then, Owen Schroyer and others are loaded for bear with the war room.
[03:42:14.286 --> 03:42:14.586]  And then,
[03:42:16.419 --> 03:42:17.241]  8 to 10 p.m.
[03:42:17.241 --> 03:42:23.174]  every night we now do coverage of the election the next 20 nights and then right through the week after the election and then I'm gonna announce
[03:42:24.614 --> 03:42:26.335]  A new show, 7 to midnight.
[03:42:26.335 --> 03:42:27.475]  I'm not even sure who's going to do it yet.
[03:42:27.475 --> 03:42:28.836]  Maybe it's going to be Matt Bracken.
[03:42:28.836 --> 03:42:29.836]  We've got to talk to him.
[03:42:29.836 --> 03:42:32.738]  I'm so busy, I'm like a one-legged man in an asking contest.
[03:42:32.738 --> 03:42:35.259]  We're going to line up a big roundtable show every night.
[03:42:35.259 --> 03:42:36.360]  It's going to be hotter than a pistol.
[03:42:36.360 --> 03:42:37.340]  7 to 10 p.m.
[03:42:37.340 --> 03:42:37.940]  Central.

[03:42:41.902 --> 03:42:49.826]  When YouTube was down last night, with Peter O'Rourke, I mean, I'm sorry, Beta O'Rourke and Cruz, Infowars was still up.
[03:42:49.826 --> 03:42:51.447]  Tonight, 8 o'clock Central.

[03:46:57.809 --> 03:47:00.451]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.883 --> 03:47:16.625]  Devil's work.
[03:47:16.625 --> 03:47:18.787]  Sexually confusing young children.
[03:47:18.787 --> 03:47:20.609]  I call it pedo work.
[03:47:20.609 --> 03:47:26.874]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:26.874 --> 03:47:35.882]  But here's pedo O'Rourke criticizing Ted Cruz for supporting a judicial nominee that doesn't want to teach three-year-old boys their little girls.
[03:47:35.882 --> 03:47:36.303]  Here it is.
[03:47:37.512 --> 03:47:45.054]  He supported the nomination of a judge, Jeff Mateer, who described transgender children as part of Satan's plan, believes in conversion therapy.
[03:47:45.054 --> 03:47:57.197]  He supported the nomination of a judge, someone to be a judge, who'd never tried a case before, another potential judge who could not tell us whether Brown versus the Board of Education was correctly decided.
[03:47:57.197 --> 03:48:02.399]  From our perspective, in a state where you can be fired for being gay, I want a justice who believes in civil rights.
[03:48:02.759 --> 03:48:09.823]  From the perspective of a state that ranks 50th in voter turnout in the country, not by accident, by design, some people drawn out of their democracy.
[03:48:09.823 --> 03:48:14.005]  I want a justice who believes in voting rights.
[03:48:14.005 --> 03:48:18.407]  Well, more, uh, Trump judicial pick calls trans children Satan's plan.
[03:48:18.407 --> 03:48:25.051]  No, the actual thing is teaching three-year-olds to have hormone therapy and have their genitals cut off is Satan's plan, I've ever heard it.
[03:48:25.051 --> 03:48:27.712]  I mean, a pedo just rapes a kid.
[03:48:27.712 --> 03:48:30.434]  A leftist, a democrat, wants to kill them in the womb and they can't.
[03:48:31.138 --> 03:48:33.739]  want to cut their genitals off.
[03:48:33.739 --> 03:48:36.581]  I guess that's why they love the Islamics so much.
[03:48:36.581 --> 03:48:38.161]  So it's truly, truly sickening.
[03:48:38.161 --> 03:48:43.524]  I wanted to point out why I'm calling Peto a rort, but I guess it's just abort the children, kill the children.
[03:48:43.524 --> 03:48:48.306]  How about child murderer support supporter a rort?
[03:48:48.306 --> 03:48:57.091]  I want to hit a few more calls with Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL bestselling author, great panelist, here before we end this hour and start with the war room here in a second.
[03:48:58.615 --> 03:49:05.459]  What do you make of this targeting of children, which they admit is a population reduction program.
[03:49:05.459 --> 03:49:11.023]  Since the left can't convince everybody to join all their weird sexual activities, they're just bullying our children.
[03:49:11.023 --> 03:49:18.348]  In the name of openness and liberalism, we allow them to engage in the raping of the children's brains.
[03:49:18.348 --> 03:49:21.970]  Well, I think that it's pure evil to basically
[03:49:23.115 --> 03:49:27.276]  So these ideas into children's minds, children are confused enough.
[03:49:27.276 --> 03:49:31.477]  I mean, some three year olds go through a stage where they think that they're a puppy dog.
[03:49:31.477 --> 03:49:37.119]  I mean, to actually put into their mind that you're not really a boy or a girl, you're the opposite.
[03:49:37.119 --> 03:49:39.919]  And to counter dress them.
[03:49:39.919 --> 03:49:41.820]  I think that it's very second evil.
[03:49:41.820 --> 03:49:47.301]  I've seen them dressed up as little drag queens and taken to pride parades.
[03:49:47.301 --> 03:49:49.142]  I think that it's extremely second evil.
[03:49:49.142 --> 03:49:50.042]  And when you take a child
[03:49:50.646 --> 03:49:50.906]  Thank you.
[03:50:15.902 --> 03:50:19.824]  People were lobotomized, wholesale and electroshocked.
[03:50:19.824 --> 03:50:22.665]  Or blacks were injected with syphilis.
[03:50:22.665 --> 03:50:27.747]  A very evil, dark experiment, a time of great evil.
[03:50:27.747 --> 03:50:31.649]  And it's intended to wreck the society, I believe.
[03:50:31.649 --> 03:50:34.430]  Transgenderism, a time of great evil.
[03:50:34.430 --> 03:50:35.991]  Absolutely, Matt Bracken, on target.
[03:50:38.106 --> 03:50:39.387]  Look, I don't defend Saudi Arabia.
[03:50:39.387 --> 03:50:40.387]  We're big critics of it.
[03:50:40.387 --> 03:50:43.049]  But it's saying it's going to stop funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:50:43.049 --> 03:50:44.650]  It's doing all the right things so far.
[03:50:44.650 --> 03:50:46.871]  Then magically this guy's killed in plain view.
[03:50:46.871 --> 03:50:48.392]  It's all recorded.
[03:50:48.392 --> 03:50:53.975]  And then my sources start saying, no, it's a false flag, just like Trump doesn't control his whole intelligence apparatus.
[03:50:53.975 --> 03:50:58.197]  And the whole media jumps on it and says Trump and Saudi Arabia are guilty.
[03:50:58.197 --> 03:51:01.519]  And now they're just... That makes me suspicious of what this really is.
[03:51:02.099 --> 03:51:06.562]  And then the Crown Prince comes out and says, it's a rogue group within my intelligence, but I didn't authorize it.
[03:51:06.562 --> 03:51:09.685]  Well, why would you authorize cutting somebody up in plain view?
[03:51:09.685 --> 03:51:11.366]  And I'm not defending Saudi Arabia, Matt.
[03:51:11.366 --> 03:51:13.988]  I just, something smells here.
[03:51:13.988 --> 03:51:14.248]  Yeah.
[03:51:14.248 --> 03:51:19.412]  I think that there's a, there's a deep state civil war going on within Saudi Arabia, just as much as here.
[03:51:19.412 --> 03:51:26.057]  You know, there are, there are very, uh, traditional Islamist, uh, power bases in Saudi Arabia.
[03:51:26.687 --> 03:51:30.070]  That consider the Crown Prince to be too much of a modernizer.
[03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:34.514]  You know, that he's, that he's, uh, he's loosening up the morals of society.
[03:51:34.514 --> 03:51:38.337]  And they want to mess up the Iran sanctions that are coming.
[03:51:38.337 --> 03:51:38.777]  Yeah.
[03:51:38.777 --> 03:51:40.919]  And I'm, and I'm no fan of Saudi Arabia.
[03:51:40.919 --> 03:51:51.748]  I personally, I think that the whole idea of playing real politic, you know, is a big mistake because, you know, even in World War I, the whole Lawrence of Arabia thing, that was the British
[03:51:52.543 --> 03:51:52.723]  Just
[03:52:08.348 --> 03:52:08.969]  No, no, I agree.
[03:52:08.969 --> 03:52:14.112]  Trump's trying to stabilize things, but you can't build castles with sand that stand up.
[03:52:14.112 --> 03:52:22.679]  It's a very dangerous game, but the left's trying to sabotage it to mess up his Iran deal, and so it's out of control.
[03:52:22.679 --> 03:52:25.201]  Let's talk to Scott, and PA's got a great point.
[03:52:25.201 --> 03:52:28.704]  Release the FISA warrants, the fake documents.
[03:52:28.704 --> 03:52:31.286]  Release the deep state stuff before the election, because Mueller
[03:52:32.264 --> 03:52:33.485]  Well, Matt, answer this first.
[03:52:33.485 --> 03:52:36.006]  Mueller and all them are acting like they're about to give up.
[03:52:36.006 --> 03:52:37.426]  I think they may be playing possum.
[03:52:37.426 --> 03:52:39.887]  Matt Bracken, quick response.
[03:52:39.887 --> 03:52:42.248]  I think that they're just bluffing before the midterms.
[03:52:42.248 --> 03:52:43.109]  They don't have anything.
[03:52:43.109 --> 03:52:48.831]  If they had anything, it would have been linked to the Washington Post and the New York Times, you know, the day after they had it.
[03:52:48.831 --> 03:52:52.673]  So I think that they're just bluffing, and I think that if Trump did it, it would work.
[03:52:52.673 --> 03:52:55.835]  No, no, I agree, but they're acting like they know that's true and they're going to roll over.
[03:52:55.835 --> 03:52:57.435]  Rosenstein signaled that.
[03:52:57.435 --> 03:52:58.416]  Mueller signaled that.
[03:52:58.416 --> 03:52:59.856]  I think they're playing possum.
[03:52:59.856 --> 03:53:00.977]  We'll bring something fake out.
[03:53:02.771 --> 03:53:03.192]  I don't know.
[03:53:03.192 --> 03:53:04.393]  I think that they're petrified.
[03:53:04.393 --> 03:53:06.555]  Glenn Simpson is looking at prison time.
[03:53:06.555 --> 03:53:09.157]  McCabe is looking at prison time.
[03:53:09.157 --> 03:53:14.062]  They're all going to start pointing upwards and saying, I was just following orders.
[03:53:14.062 --> 03:53:14.723]  No, I agree.
[03:53:14.723 --> 03:53:20.889]  And so Mueller signifying to Rosenstein that the probe's about to be wrapped up, I think that is a big victory.
[03:53:22.583 --> 03:53:29.148]  Yeah, they're all trying to unwind this and defuse this bomb with the least of them going to prison for the sabotage.
[03:53:29.148 --> 03:53:31.649]  As soon as he threatened to release the document, they did that.
[03:53:31.649 --> 03:53:33.591]  If he holds back, they may double track back.
[03:53:33.591 --> 03:53:35.352]  I think he hits them.
[03:53:35.352 --> 03:53:36.473]  They're dishonorable.
[03:53:36.473 --> 03:53:37.894]  Go ahead and hit them with everything.
[03:53:40.194 --> 03:53:44.377]  It's a poker game where you want to hold your best cards for the very last.
[03:53:44.377 --> 03:53:51.283]  You want to see your adversary, you want to see his best hand and then finally slam down your cards on top of his.
[03:53:51.283 --> 03:53:57.348]  So everybody's just playing a waiting game to see who's got the, you know, when Mueller plays his last cards,
[03:53:58.223 --> 03:54:00.804]  That's when Trump will play his final cards.
[03:54:00.804 --> 03:54:08.226]  Trump doesn't want to go off before the midterms because the media will make it look like he's trying to sabotage Mueller, even though Mueller's got nothing.
[03:54:08.226 --> 03:54:09.086]  It's a pure bluff.
[03:54:09.086 --> 03:54:10.047]  No, I agree with you.
[03:54:10.047 --> 03:54:10.747]  Scott, go ahead.
[03:54:10.747 --> 03:54:13.628]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[03:54:13.628 --> 03:54:18.729]  Well, first, I just want to tell you, I'm sitting here wearing my We Stand With Trump InfoWars shirt.
[03:54:18.729 --> 03:54:22.430]  I'm wearing it, and everybody gives me compliments on it.
[03:54:22.430 --> 03:54:25.371]  I wear it around town all the time.
[03:54:25.371 --> 03:54:26.812]  And I think it's important that
[03:54:28.182 --> 03:54:30.903]  You know, we show our colors.
[03:54:30.903 --> 03:54:35.485]  But as far as the FISA goes, I think, I don't know.
[03:54:35.485 --> 03:54:38.606]  That's why I wanted to ask you about that.
[03:54:38.606 --> 03:54:46.268]  But bottom line is, I think Trump, no matter what the Dems do, Trump still wins.
[03:54:46.268 --> 03:54:47.429]  What do you think?
[03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:48.689]  Well, I agree with Matt.
[03:54:48.689 --> 03:54:54.251]  The best cars usually hold till last, but like super villains archetypally always brag and wait too long.
[03:54:54.251 --> 03:54:56.312]  If you have the torpedo that blows the enemy up,
[03:54:57.267 --> 03:55:00.589]  I just say release it now and hammer their ass to make sure we win the midterms.
[03:55:00.589 --> 03:55:02.350]  I think release it all now.
[03:55:02.350 --> 03:55:04.971]  I don't want to just scare the hell out of them and watch them roll over.
[03:55:04.971 --> 03:55:06.332]  Matt?
[03:55:06.332 --> 03:55:08.553]  I totally agree.
[03:55:08.553 --> 03:55:10.814]  The supervillain analogy is perfect.
[03:55:10.814 --> 03:55:17.318]  They always give the guy one more chance while the laser is crawling up the table towards his private parts.
[03:55:17.318 --> 03:55:19.499]  Do it when you've got the guy tied to the table.
[03:55:19.499 --> 03:55:20.759]  Do it right now.
[03:55:20.759 --> 03:55:22.500]  Don't give him a chance to get away.
[03:55:22.500 --> 03:55:23.821]  Fire that torpedo.
[03:55:23.821 --> 03:55:25.302]  I agree.
[03:55:25.302 --> 03:55:25.622]  Scott?
[03:55:28.322 --> 03:55:32.640]  Let's change Warren's name from Pocahontas to Tonto, which means foolish.
[03:55:34.485 --> 03:55:40.749]  But then, there's a great guy named Tontos, we don't want to do that, but no, I absolutely hear what you're saying, and it's just crazy what a fraud she is.
[03:55:40.749 --> 03:55:49.514]  I mean, just on my dad's side, through his dad, I'm six percent, I don't call myself Native American, I'm proud of it, it makes me stronger, good folks.
[03:55:49.514 --> 03:55:53.956]  But then all the rest of my family, especially East Texas, but I don't call myself Native American.
[03:55:53.956 --> 03:55:56.898]  This woman has not even one-tenth of one percent.
[03:55:56.898 --> 03:55:58.839]  She is a galactic fraud.
[03:55:58.839 --> 03:55:59.380]  Thank you, Scott.
[03:56:00.239 --> 03:56:01.961]  Man, all the callers have held.
[03:56:01.961 --> 03:56:02.942]  I know some of you, two hours.
[03:56:02.942 --> 03:56:05.024]  That's because we can take 100 calls at once.
[03:56:05.024 --> 03:56:07.427]  I apologize, but it's part of this.
[03:56:07.427 --> 03:56:08.348]  You call back tomorrow.
[03:56:08.348 --> 03:56:13.894]  In fact, if John can get all their names and numbers, we'll call them tomorrow, and they'll all, the order they held the longest, go on air first.
[03:56:13.894 --> 03:56:16.777]  But, if John can get all their names and numbers, I'll send you all...

[03:56:43.527 --> 03:56:44.388]  They control the system.
[03:56:44.388 --> 03:56:46.950]  We're down to one payment processor right now, folks.
[03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:48.071]  They're trying to take that out.
[03:56:48.071 --> 03:56:49.251]  They're targeting it.
[03:56:49.251 --> 03:56:51.033]  But you get the order through, it gets shipped to you.
[03:56:51.033 --> 03:56:56.837]  But now is the time to act, to make sure we're provisioned into the future, if it takes a while to get payment processing back up.
[03:56:56.837 --> 03:56:57.858]  So do it.
