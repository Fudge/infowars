[00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:08.971]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:16.676]  When a person dies and is buried, it seems a certain voodoo priest who will have the power to bring him back to life.
[00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:17.616]  How horrible.
[00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.178]  It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own.
[00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:28.999]  You see them sometimes, walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring.
[00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.820]  You mean like Democrats?
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:42.230]  And the candidate looked around for a podium from which to give his speech, and the only thing he could find was a pile of that stuff that Bess Truman took 35 years trying to get Harry to call fertilizer.
[00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:50.540]  So, he got up on the mound, and when they came back, he gave his speech.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.122]  And at the end of it, the farmer said, that's the first time I ever heard a Republican speech.
[00:00:55.122 --> 00:01:00.345]  And the candidate said, that's the first time I've ever given a Republican speech from a Democratic platform.
[00:01:05.043 --> 00:01:07.224]  Trump's just signed a thing that'll save millions of people!
[00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:08.765]  RACIST!
[00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:09.905]  The economy's coming back!
[00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.446]  RACIST!
[00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.728]  All the numbers say the Republicans are gonna win Congress in the midterms!
[00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:15.889]  RACIST!
[00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:19.891]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:22.152]  RACIST!
[00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:26.577]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:28.379]  It must be racist!
[00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.022]  MS-13 can't torture little girls in desperation!
[00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.143]  RACIST!
[00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:36.087]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:36.948]  RACIST!
[00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:55.048]  I had a conversation the other day with a friend who's also an advocate in the LGBTQ community in Florida who rightly took me to task for my tweets mocking Ann Coulter using transgender stereotypes.
[00:01:55.048 --> 00:02:00.330]  I apologize to my friend and I want to apologize to the trans community and to Ann.
[00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.552]  Those tweets were wrong and horrible.
[00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:11.016]  I look back today at some of the ways I've talked casually about people and gender identity and sexual orientation and I wonder who that even was.
[00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.810]  Will the left take out one of its propaganda mouthpieces?
[00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.411]  MSNBC host Joy Reid is under the microscope after recently fending off a homophobic rant posted to her blog she claims was fabricated.
[00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:38.454]  Now Joy Reid has been outed yet again by the PC social media police as having supported the 9-11 documentary Loose Change and siding with none other than public enemy number one Alex Jones.
[00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:39.254]  BuzzFeed writes,
[00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:53.503]  A March 22, 2006 post to her web blog, ReadBlog, archived by the Wayback Machine entitled, The Official Story, links to Loose Change 9-11, a viral 80-minute web video originally released in 2005.
[00:02:55.004 --> 00:03:06.057]  Loose Change, which was produced in part by InfoWars' Alex Jones, alleged that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were, in fact, planned by the U.S.
[00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:06.938]  government.
[00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.622]  The central claims in Loose Change have been widely debunked.
[00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:20.969]  Of course, BuzzFeed references popular mechanics, blatant In-Q-Tel CIA propaganda, and Vanity Fair, a far-left polarizing rag.
[00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:29.755]  Both of them using the mass media phenomenon known as expectation bias to stop the public from asking relevant questions.
[00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:31.596]  And of course, there is no mention
[00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:35.459]  The fundamental question is, do you believe the official story of 9-11, the Post reads?
[00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:35.839]  If you do, great.
[00:03:56.954 --> 00:04:01.579]  If you don't, then everything that happened after that is called into serious question.
[00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:11.770]  Even if you're agnostic, or you tend to believe that Al-Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the government had no warning, such a thing could happen.
[00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.413]  It's worth taking a second look.
[00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:15.514]  You gotta ask yourself,
[00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.314]  Where is all this going?
[00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:42.662]  When Roseanne's American anomaly of a TV show that spoke to 12 million viewers per episode came to a grinding halt, while Joy Reid can barely muster 1 million viewers, exceeded the left's tolerant muzzle on homophobia, and was given the platform and the time to come up with a shady excuse about it, and continues to keep her job, and has now been outed as one of them.
[00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:51.734]  The boundaries of Gestapo's social media PC culture are closing in on our dying process of free speech.
[00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:57.022]  What happened to the public arena where ideas were met with either a majority... That's right, we'll be back.
[00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:58.224]  That's John Bowne reporting.

[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.802]  It's Friday, June 1st, 2018.
[00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:48.145]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:49.746]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:49.746 --> 00:06:53.428]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:56.190]  If you're a TV viewer, you'll be able to see this.
[00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.192]  If you're a radio listener, you can go pull it up yourself.
[00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:04.235]  Democrats panic as indictments of Comey, Clinton, and McCabe loom.
[00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:18.230]  And then we have a special report where I break down my DOJ and White House sources saying Trump, as of the first of the year, had made the decision to take the gloves off.
[00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:29.473]  You heard that from Ali Alexander, who's worked at the highest levels of the Republican Party, that he was told the same thing, that Trump actually... Well, I was told not to share the full details of it, but let's just say he blew up.
[00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:37.659]  The Trump you see in Publix, the real Trump, where he's all focused and zenned out, but then there's the other Trump.
[00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.561]  And let's just say he turns things over and things.
[00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.641]  And he's made the decision he is coming after them.
[00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.662]  And boy, does he have the goods.
[00:07:47.662 --> 00:07:48.522]  So the fight is on.
[00:07:48.522 --> 00:07:50.202]  That's why you're seeing all this insanity.
[00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:52.183]  There's that headline, March 18th.
[00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:54.283]  There's another one.
[00:07:54.283 --> 00:07:56.024]  March 17th is when I got the news.
[00:07:57.096 --> 00:07:57.576]  Breaking!
[00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:01.117]  Trump preparing mass indictments of Clinton Crime Network.
[00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:08.220]  The United States is only weeks away from rebirth, but more battles lie ahead.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.560]  You might want to go read those articles.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.420]  You might want to go see those.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.901]  Why?
[00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:18.063]  Zero Hedge has a very nice boil down, as they do.
[00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:24.885]  And the Washington Post and others, and the Wall Street Journal, are all reporting
[00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:28.763]  About the interrogation of Comey about McCabe.
[00:08:28.763 --> 00:08:35.289]  Comey's thrown him under the bus and gone on national television and said, well, you know, it's not good to lie.
[00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.212]  And McCabe has lied.
[00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:45.337]  Yeah, he lied to the Justice Department, he lied to Congress, he lied to everybody else that leaked criminal information.
[00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:47.079]  That is, the leaking was criminal.
[00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:48.840]  And so you see Comey moving away.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.261]  Comey directed this.
[00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:53.960]  So the rats have left the sinking ship.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:01.405]  They're now on pieces of driftwood fighting with each other over the scarce space as the storm blows in and the waves begin to crash.
[00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:05.588]  And the little piece of driftwood they're on isn't holding them up anymore.
[00:09:05.588 --> 00:09:08.911]  And more and more they're underwater gasping, gasping, gasping for air.
[00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.433]  Those few seconds when the driftwood pops back up from under the waves.
[00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:27.140]  Ah, the little rat hands, little rat paws, little rat fingernails dug in, dug into the driftwood, but now the driftwood's pulling apart their little, little claws, their little red eyes darting about as they hit all the panic buttons and, Destroy Alex Jones!
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.961]  Destroy Trump!
[00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:29.442]  Destroy the Americans!
[00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:30.382]  Crush them!
[00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:31.943]  Sue them!
[00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:33.363]  Lie about them!
[00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:34.284]  Help us!
[00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:44.061]  Let's see, you got fake lawsuits against me, and then your top people in Hollywood get indicted for rape.
[00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:46.621]  I'll take that tit for tat.
[00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.822]  Because we're going to give a lot more than we get.
[00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:53.804]  I believe in giving.
[00:09:53.804 --> 00:09:55.804]  And now Trump believes in giving.
[00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.665]  Giving you hell.
[00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:02.866]  So, fill your hand.
[00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:04.687]  We're going to go over all of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:09.088]  The indictments loom.
[00:10:09.088 --> 00:10:14.370]  No more, leave us alone, we'll leave you alone.
[00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.690]  Trump already tried that.
[00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.793]  What did Giuliani say three weeks ago, and then again two weeks ago, then again a week ago?
[00:10:20.793 --> 00:10:23.054]  Drop it now, stop it now, it's fake.
[00:10:23.054 --> 00:10:32.758]  Get out of the way, stop trying to sabotage, stop trying to lie about it, stop trying to side with foreign governments, or we're going to tear you apart.
[00:10:34.878 --> 00:10:38.460]  We're going to tear you apart and Trump means it.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.142]  And that's why all the world from Saudi Arabia to North Korea, they're listening.
[00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:48.885]  It was always part of the negotiation that North Korea would try to ask for too much or weasel out of it.
[00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:50.566]  And Trump would say the summit's off.
[00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.468]  And then four days later, the summit's back on because North Korea rolled back over.
[00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:55.769]  And they might try that game again.
[00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:04.764]  There's a new sheriff in town and things are different and we're getting 30 years of suppressed technology fast-tracked in medicine.
[00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:06.906]  It's not going to be just there.
[00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:23.380]  I have been told by high-level sources before Trump even got in that he has been briefed by the generals on the suppressed technologies in close to free energy, beyond quantum computing, stuff that makes maglev trains look like tinker toys,
[00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:33.067]  Incredible sciences in plants, in farming.
[00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:40.551]  But the biggest area is energy, advanced spacecraft.
[00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:46.634]  I mean, Trump is really looking at starting to turn this loose.
[00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:47.595]  Globalists don't like that.
[00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:52.854]  The globals are like, oh, the Chinese have lasers that can kill our satellites.
[00:11:52.854 --> 00:11:56.997]  Yeah, well, we had them in 1975.
[00:11:56.997 --> 00:12:15.588]  We had in orbit by 1978 over a hundred drone attack ships that just sit there with their power off, waiting with large loads of DU shabbo rounds, meteor guns from orbit.
[00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:31.356]  Now they had that in the 70s, they accidentally declassified it in 92, in a debate on C-SPAN, so then Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars, when it was secret to talk about it, Colonel Bowman.
[00:12:31.356 --> 00:12:33.437]  Okay, now you know the truth.
[00:12:33.437 --> 00:12:39.100]  We are 45 years ahead of the Chai Komsh.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.541]  Everything you see on the battlefield that we have is 30 to 40 years old.
[00:12:43.442 --> 00:12:49.765]  Just like they had the B-2 bomber for 20 years in active duty?
[00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:54.007]  In service before it was shown to people in 1989?
[00:12:54.007 --> 00:13:06.352]  My dad saw B-2 bombers, Apache helicopters, and stealth fighters when he was 10 years old in military drills that happened south of Dallas.
[00:13:07.776 --> 00:13:12.660]  When I was a kid, driving outside Dallas, I saw stealth fighters.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.322]  These stealth fighters you see today, but they were gray.
[00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:23.089]  Three of them, flying at like 200 feet above the ground over farmland.
[00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:26.291]  That was 35 plus years ago.
[00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:36.454]  So, just understand, the globalists had captured America and they had all those systems and were suppressing it and stealing all our technology.
[00:13:36.454 --> 00:13:38.195]  It's all stopping.
[00:13:38.195 --> 00:13:39.796]  There'll be no Chinese century.
[00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:42.517]  As long as it's communist.
[00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:46.199]  I welcome a Chinese century and renaissance, but not under the communists.
[00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:54.904]  There'll be none of that.
[00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:58.306]  Notice the crews in there of your TV viewer just searching whatever I say and they're actually finding it.
[00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:01.954]  I'm surprised how much of this is now coming out.
[00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:06.977]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can never keep somebody alive for sure, because an artery might blow.
[00:14:06.977 --> 00:14:08.998]  You know, it's like putting new parts in an old car.
[00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.459]  So many parts are going bad, you've got to put all new parts in it.
[00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:17.962]  But they can stall death 50 years now, in most cases, and if you can do that, that's basically close to immortality.
[00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:19.876]  And that's the big secret.
[00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:21.337]  And they don't want you to have that.
[00:14:21.337 --> 00:14:23.438]  Well, Trump wants you to have that.
[00:14:23.438 --> 00:14:29.381]  I told you the most important thing at the inauguration was life extension technologies and other technologies.
[00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:31.902]  And I told you it'd be in a speech, and it was.
[00:14:31.902 --> 00:14:33.643]  Because we're dialed in.
[00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:35.884]  I don't have to talk to the president to know what he's doing.
[00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:38.245]  We are jacked into the same spirit.
[00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.485]  And the enemy knows it.
[00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:41.606]  They cannot stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:42.787]  And Trump is for real.
[00:14:42.787 --> 00:14:43.807]  And he's delivering.
[00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:44.728]  He's not out to get you.
[00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:48.386]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:51.929]  We're going to come back and get into the looming indictments and how these are going to go down, reportedly.
[00:14:52.987 --> 00:14:55.148]  And so much more of the Deep State.
[00:14:55.148 --> 00:15:01.710]  They are in prime attack mode right now because they are cornered rats on that piece of beech wood, driftwood.
[00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.231]  Please remember, we are Lister Supported.
[00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.432]  We're gonna have to end this special early next week.
[00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:10.414]  We have free shipping on all of our best-selling nutraceutical items and many other items, like storable food.
[00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:18.036]  But if you'll just try Brain Force and see what a good, clean, high-quality, natural boost for your brain is, it's incredible.
[00:15:18.036 --> 00:15:19.137]  If you'll get Alpha Power,
[00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:20.498]  50% off.
[00:15:20.498 --> 00:15:23.120]  We sold out of Alpha Power and we had it at 30% off.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.940]  It's back in.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.303]  Libido, stamina, energy, mind.
[00:15:27.303 --> 00:15:29.684]  But they all are different formulas that hit from different angles.
[00:15:29.684 --> 00:15:31.966]  Different people like different formulas better.
[00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:33.927]  Rainforce, Alpha Power, 50% off.
[00:15:33.927 --> 00:15:35.669]  X2, 50% off.
[00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:37.490]  But only when you get it with Biotrue Selenium.
[00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.011]  It's also 50% off.
[00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:39.571]  They go together.
[00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:43.294]  The new product, the real red pill, plus now with energy.

[00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:57.017]  The tip of the spear, the dreaded information warfare attack system that the globalists absolutely shake in fear of, you, by funding us, will bring them down.
[00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:02.819]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:16.122]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:16.122 --> 00:20:16.742]  Watch me!
[00:20:16.742 --> 00:20:17.242]  Watch me!
[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.671]  Watch me!
[00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:20.552]  I got something!
[00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.373]  I got it!
[00:20:22.373 --> 00:20:24.354]  Watch me!
[00:20:24.354 --> 00:20:25.675]  I got it!
[00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:27.257]  Hey!
[00:20:27.257 --> 00:20:30.799]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:34.082]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[00:20:34.082 --> 00:20:36.343]  Oh yeah!
[00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:37.404]  I got soul!
[00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.866]  And I'm super bad!
[00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:41.327]  I got soul!
[00:20:41.327 --> 00:20:46.791]  And I'm super bad!
[00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:47.572]  I got something!
[00:20:59.784 --> 00:21:09.368]  You know why the globalists are saying Alex Jones's sponsors have been taken, Alex Jones is being sued, Alex Jones is a loser, Alex Jones is failing?
[00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:13.070]  Because they want to project the idea to their faltering, failing
[00:21:14.562 --> 00:21:21.127]  Race-baiting, politically correct culture of destruction that they're winning when they're losing.
[00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:29.472]  When their program of demoralizing this country and sabotaging it has the wheels coming off.
[00:21:29.472 --> 00:21:33.875]  You know in China, they execute gays.
[00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:40.140]  Did you know in Russia, it's tolerated but you don't push it on kids.
[00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:52.780]  So our media puts out travel alerts if you're going to go to the World Cup or any other event in Russia, because the Russians might be mean to you if you are two guys and you kiss in public.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.520]  I've looked into that.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.560]  That's not really the case.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.822]  But what I'm getting at here is, is that China kills gays.
[00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:06.182]  The Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, Al-Qaeda kills them.
[00:22:06.182 --> 00:22:07.822]  You never hear about that.
[00:22:07.822 --> 00:22:09.643]  It's all about how Russia does this.
[00:22:12.023 --> 00:22:20.165]  Some talk show host, some liberal talk show host, ten years ago or five years ago on her blog said something about the gay mafia.
[00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:25.886]  And everybody can all get upset about it and get their feathers all in a big ruffle.
[00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:29.567]  It's all just simulated civil rights.
[00:22:29.567 --> 00:22:31.848]  Starbucks is funding all this race-baiting garbage.
[00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:42.188]  So that that's an ideology, a corporate ideology to control their people and to distract them from real issues like unionizing or higher wages.
[00:22:42.188 --> 00:22:45.130]  It's all distractionary.
[00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:52.936]  Meanwhile, Democrats panic as indictments of Comey, Clinton and McCabe loom.
[00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:57.159]  That was an Infowars.com exclusive on March 18th and March 17th.
[00:22:57.159 --> 00:23:01.463]  Two different articles when I had been told that no, they're going for the indictments, they have it.
[00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:04.597]  They are in the White House.
[00:23:04.597 --> 00:23:06.777]  They are working with the Justice Department.
[00:23:06.777 --> 00:23:10.119]  They know the Inspector General is bringing all this information out.
[00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:19.062]  And it won't matter what old twinkle toes Jeff Sessions does, because this is going to move forward.
[00:23:19.062 --> 00:23:22.643]  And this information is going to be completely damning.
[00:23:22.643 --> 00:23:24.384]  And it's coming out very soon.
[00:23:25.964 --> 00:23:27.786]  Well then there's a new article out today.
[00:23:27.786 --> 00:23:34.254]  Comey grilled as feds seriously consider charging McCabe in criminal referral.
[00:23:34.254 --> 00:23:35.055]  Washington Post.
[00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:39.743]  Wall Street Journal, we're going to cover it all in the last segment of this hour.
[00:23:39.743 --> 00:23:42.264]  But not now, because I should have said this right up front.
[00:23:42.264 --> 00:23:47.367]  I'm never really good at plugging, so I've got to tune into each segment, because you never know what's coming up.
[00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:55.291]  Dinesh D'Souza just got his pardon announcement yesterday from the President of the United States, something CNN called very dangerous.
[00:23:55.291 --> 00:24:02.615]  Yes, Clinton pardoned cocaine dealers, sex traffickers, hundreds of pardons.
[00:24:02.615 --> 00:24:05.957]  Obama did similar things, but the media would never really cover that much.
[00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:19.411]  Oh my gosh, but a filmmaker and a former member of Reagan's cabinet, Reagan advisor, an amazing American success story, he didn't fill out a PAC form on five donations he gave.
[00:24:19.411 --> 00:24:24.615]  Oh my gosh, and it came out in his divorce.
[00:24:24.615 --> 00:24:29.879]  And so Dinesh D'Souza, the second biggest documentary maker in the world, how do you deal with him?
[00:24:29.879 --> 00:24:32.321]  Oh, just throw his butt in prison for nine months, that'll go well.
[00:24:34.534 --> 00:24:35.936]  You know, we really pushed it to Trump.
[00:24:35.936 --> 00:24:41.243]  He didn't even know that Arpaio had been convicted by a judge of contempt he was facing here in prison.
[00:24:41.243 --> 00:24:44.647]  And I know a lot of folks pushed D'Souza.
[00:24:44.647 --> 00:24:48.432]  In fact, I personally pushed Stone.
[00:24:48.432 --> 00:24:49.533]  I'm just bragging, this is true.
[00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:50.294]  I don't know how people did it.
[00:24:51.937 --> 00:24:52.898]  Other people did as well.
[00:24:52.898 --> 00:24:56.080]  I said, deSouza, deSouza, deSouza, deSouza, deSouza.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.061]  Because that'll bring all that up and show the hypocrisy.
[00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:01.743]  I know for a fact Stone brought that up to Trump, because he told me he did.
[00:25:01.743 --> 00:25:06.846]  And CNN's real scared, they go, you can just bring it up to Trump, then he looks into it, he makes the decision.
[00:25:06.846 --> 00:25:08.447]  That hadn't been done in 100 years.
[00:25:08.447 --> 00:25:15.012]  Presidents used to make the decision, but they have a pardoning board, you know, that the president gives it to them and they decide.
[00:25:15.012 --> 00:25:20.275]  No, the president has that executive power, and they can't stand watching him use that veto.
[00:25:22.008 --> 00:25:25.249]  And the only person that can veto the president is the public.
[00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:29.130]  If they think it's bad, then they'll support impeachment in Congress.
[00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:38.933]  The only reason the president can't have his veto over the legislative and judicial is in terms of impeachment or crimes he's committed.
[00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:42.174]  He cannot pardon himself.
[00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:45.815]  And the fact that he's exercising that is mooey delicious.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.921]  I mean, it is really, really, really good.
[00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:52.621]  And he's doing it for all sorts of good people.
[00:25:52.621 --> 00:25:55.222]  Martha Stewart, totally political.
[00:25:55.222 --> 00:25:57.683]  That was, Comey did that.
[00:25:57.683 --> 00:25:59.664]  He would never go after real kingpins.
[00:25:59.664 --> 00:26:03.205]  They knew exactly what, you know, all these Ponzi scheme operators were doing.
[00:26:03.205 --> 00:26:04.045]  They knew all about it.
[00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:04.765]  They were involved.
[00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:10.387]  They were on the boards of the law firms that would then certify the stuff that Madoff was doing to say they had protection.
[00:26:10.387 --> 00:26:13.748]  But then Martha Stewart, she didn't insider trade selling $800,000 in stock.
[00:26:16.437 --> 00:26:21.620]  No, but she misled investigators, which wasn't even true.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.903]  Oh, and he's talking about Blagojevich, too, who did nothing compared to them.
[00:26:24.903 --> 00:26:31.026]  Oh, imagine getting Blagojevich out so he can testify.
[00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:32.247]  You guys want to fight?
[00:26:32.247 --> 00:26:33.728]  You want to take the gloves off?
[00:26:33.728 --> 00:26:35.990]  Trump's putting brass knuckles on.
[00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.970]  You started the fight.
[00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.691]  You took the gloves off.
[00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:41.213]  You've been ticking this country while it's been down forever.
[00:26:41.213 --> 00:26:42.314]  Now, get ready.
[00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:48.340]  Because Trump's like a big old bear, and he's getting up on his hind legs, and you know what that means.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.381]  He's gonna chew your head off.
[00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:52.801]  Couple bites.
[00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.101]  Bye-bye.
[00:26:54.101 --> 00:26:55.122]  He's got the people.
[00:26:55.122 --> 00:26:56.162]  He's got the law.
[00:26:56.162 --> 00:26:57.182]  He's got the history.
[00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.943]  He's delivered in a year and a half.
[00:26:58.943 --> 00:27:00.223]  Everything's turning around.
[00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:01.363]  You're crapping your britches.
[00:27:01.363 --> 00:27:03.164]  4% growth rate's coming.

[00:28:46.976 --> 00:28:48.017]  They have a term for it.
[00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:51.060]  It's where you get it in the wild.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.961]  It's beyond organic.

[00:31:05.618 --> 00:31:06.198]  Thanks for calling.
[00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:07.639]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:11.241]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:31:11.241 --> 00:31:19.986]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:36.256]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:45.385]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:50.271]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:55.536]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.

[00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:26.142]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:26.142 --> 00:33:27.643]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.453 --> 00:33:43.361]  Make no mistake, we're all living in one of the most important times in human history, as populist and nationalist pro-free market forces reawaken and ignite in our darkest hour and see success everywhere.
[00:33:43.361 --> 00:33:51.226]  And we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Dinesh D'Souza, the second highest grossing documentary filmmaker in history, best-selling author,
[00:33:52.026 --> 00:34:06.534]  And for that, falsely imprisoned, as the President has pointed out, announcing his pardon yesterday for a nine-month false prison sentence for getting five friends to donate, Hillary, again, billions of dollars, hundreds of millions in laundered money at her foundation.
[00:34:06.534 --> 00:34:07.194]  Unbelievable.
[00:34:07.194 --> 00:34:12.737]  That eschews a few, you know, $30,000 or something, not even illegal from my view, didn't fill out paperwork.
[00:34:12.737 --> 00:34:14.398]  Well, now he joins us for this segment.
[00:34:15.278 --> 00:34:25.942]  We really appreciate him coming on to talk about how he heard about it, what's going on, and has he talked to the president yet, and what does he make of CNN and others calling it dangerous?
[00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:41.269]  You know, Mark Rich is a cocaine dealer, all these other money launderers, sex traffickers get pardoned, but oh you, you bad, bad man, a political prisoner of the left, nine months in prison because they were scared of your next film.
[00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:42.109]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:34:43.554 --> 00:34:44.755]  Hey, it's a pleasure.
[00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:54.582]  You know, I think, Alex, that when we hear words like dangerous from CNN, we have to learn to decode or translate what they actually mean.
[00:34:54.582 --> 00:35:02.748]  So what they mean is that Mark Rich, no matter whether he's an arms dealer or a drug trafficker, he's not dangerous to them.
[00:35:03.428 --> 00:35:15.635]  In fact, he's on their side in the sense that he is willing to lavish tens of millions of dollars into progressive and left-wing causes.
[00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:17.937]  I actually am dangerous to them.
[00:35:17.937 --> 00:35:18.257]  Why?
[00:35:18.257 --> 00:35:22.599]  Because I'm actually out there undermining their ideology at every turn.
[00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:26.742]  And so to pardon me is to unleash me in an even bigger way.
[00:35:26.742 --> 00:35:31.765]  So when I hear these kinds of things from CNN, far from trying to refute them,
[00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:38.811]  I essentially look behind the curtain and I go, I know why you're saying that and in a certain sense you're right.
[00:35:38.811 --> 00:35:39.832]  Incredible.
[00:35:39.832 --> 00:35:44.136]  And of course the word is that the president told you that he wants to unleash you.
[00:35:44.136 --> 00:35:44.857]  Can you talk about that?
[00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:56.316]  Yeah, I was in my study two days ago, working away, and the phone rang, you know, unknown caller, and I picked it up, and it was the White House operator.
[00:35:56.316 --> 00:36:15.069]  She just goes, she confirmed it was me, I hold the line for the President of the United States, and Trump comes on, and the first thing he said to me was, hey, Dinesh, you know, I'm sitting here with John Kelly, Chief of Staff, and we both want to let you know that we think that you're a great voice for freedom and for America.
[00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:21.655]  And he said, I gotta tell you man to man that, you know, your case, you know, you got screwed.
[00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:23.897]  He goes, you should have gotten it.
[00:36:23.897 --> 00:36:25.099]  It was a technicality.
[00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.541]  You should have gotten a fine and move on with life.
[00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:31.365]  But no, these guys went after you with everything they got.
[00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:33.287]  And he goes, it was a terrible injustice.
[00:36:33.287 --> 00:36:36.530]  He goes, the good thing is, you know, I'm in a position to correct it.
[00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.251]  So I want to,
[00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:39.193]  I want to clear your slate.
[00:36:39.193 --> 00:36:41.376]  I'm going to give you a full pardon tomorrow morning.
[00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:47.124]  And I want you to go out there and just do what you're doing at an even bigger scale than ever.
[00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:58.485]  And boy, that's going to upset the young Turks and others who would, in debates with you, defend Hillary and all her crimes, but say you're a criminal and have the audience hiss at you.
[00:36:58.485 --> 00:37:07.789]  I mean, these people are incredible in the way they're trying to persecute people and destroy people that they intellectually can't fight.
[00:37:07.789 --> 00:37:10.791]  Of course, you had your big film coming out for 2016.
[00:37:10.791 --> 00:37:14.852]  They wanted to stop you putting it out, so they put you in prison and bragged about it.
[00:37:14.852 --> 00:37:16.353]  I mean, that is just frightening.
[00:37:19.294 --> 00:37:29.300]  Well, what's happened is that the left in America is using the judicial system to, what you may call it, create the American version of the show trial.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:37.585]  Now, of course, in the Stalinist show trials, they literally would torture people, pull out their fingernails, and this kind of thing.
[00:37:37.585 --> 00:37:39.526]  The American version doesn't look like that.
[00:37:39.526 --> 00:37:41.267]  The American version is something like this.
[00:37:42.107 --> 00:37:46.351]  Hey Dinesh, we're going to charge you with exceeding the campaign finance law.
[00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:53.177]  But just in case you're thinking of pleading not guilty, we have an ace up our sleeve.
[00:37:53.177 --> 00:37:56.701]  We're ready to drop on you a second charge.
[00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:59.243]  Not that you did anything different or wrong.
[00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:01.225]  We're not claiming you had made a second offense.
[00:38:01.665 --> 00:38:04.507]  We're going to re-describe your offense in another way.
[00:38:04.507 --> 00:38:07.688]  So we're now going to say you filed a false document.
[00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:11.230]  And that happens to carry a penalty of five years in federal prison.
[00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.472]  So, how would you like to take a chance to completely ruin your life?
[00:38:15.472 --> 00:38:21.495]  Well, if you don't want to do that, why don't you plead guilty to the first charge and we will drop the second charge.
[00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:24.456]  And they go, oh look he admits he did it, he's so evil!
[00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.231]  They did, exactly.
[00:38:52.231 --> 00:39:04.819]  So they then put on the robe and played with false neutrality, and act as if this is something that I just fessed up to, as opposed to the fact that they had me over a barrel.
[00:39:04.819 --> 00:39:13.385]  And the thing to remember about this kind of bludgeon, this plea bargain bludgeon, is it tends to pressure not just the guilty, but even the innocent.
[00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:13.926]  Of course it does.
[00:39:14.426 --> 00:39:26.456]  In the limited time we have, hopefully you'll come on for 30 minutes or a full hour in the near future, but I know you're really the man of the hour right now as you're being kind of released like the Kraken, you know, out of your political no-man's land, thank God.
[00:39:26.456 --> 00:39:28.458]  Of course, you've got a new film, new book coming out.
[00:39:28.458 --> 00:39:32.321]  They never shackled you completely, but you are now absolutely being magnified.
[00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:38.526]  I'm so excited that, you know, Trump sees that as he's like releasing a great intellectual mind against the enemy.
[00:39:38.526 --> 00:39:39.147]  This is a war.
[00:39:40.208 --> 00:39:42.810]  Anything else Trump told you, what'd you say to him?
[00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:44.312]  If someone was private, that's fine.
[00:39:44.312 --> 00:39:45.633]  But that's what Trump's told me before.
[00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:49.338]  He said, we need you in there fighting hard, press the attack, keep it up.
[00:39:49.338 --> 00:39:51.059]  We're gonna make America great again.
[00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:57.466]  And then to see how the president's turning the country around now, and how it's just panicking these people.
[00:39:57.466 --> 00:39:58.648]  They're pulling their hair out, Dinesh.
[00:39:59.827 --> 00:40:10.530]  I think the broader issue here, Alex, that Trump is well aware of is what you can call the gangsterization of politics that has occurred under Obama and Hillary.
[00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:14.091]  Now, this was not the way American politics used to be.
[00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:20.072]  So, I can't really imagine Jimmy Carter, you know, he was an ideological nincompoop.
[00:40:20.072 --> 00:40:21.953]  You know, he had his own problems.
[00:40:23.133 --> 00:40:29.874]  I don't see him, you know, trying to lock up his political opponents any more than, say, George H.W.
[00:40:29.874 --> 00:40:32.915]  Bush would dream of locking up Michael Moore.
[00:40:32.915 --> 00:40:34.755]  It was a different era.
[00:40:34.755 --> 00:40:40.756]  But with Obama, we got this sort of Linsky-ite idea that, look, let's just use the IRS against him.
[00:40:40.756 --> 00:40:44.437]  Let's just weaponize the Justice Department and the FBI.
[00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:46.197]  Let's secretly tape them.
[00:40:46.197 --> 00:40:48.358]  Let's put a spy in the campaign.
[00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:50.198]  So you can see here on my case,
[00:40:50.858 --> 00:40:56.547]  In a sense, as a miniature of some of this larger problem of the gangsterism.
[00:41:04.451 --> 00:41:14.959]  The Washington Post, they're all reporting that they are looking at indictments of McCabe for lying, for illegally leaking, for all of this, and that leads back to Comey.
[00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:24.707]  I've heard, and I don't know if you've heard, that they are seriously going for the juggler now, not because we're being political gangsters, but because these gangsters have gone too far and have to be dealt with.
[00:41:24.707 --> 00:41:26.589]  They're too dangerous to not prosecute.
[00:41:28.103 --> 00:41:32.225]  Well, let me give you a small glimpse of my own dealing with the Comey FBI.
[00:41:32.225 --> 00:41:39.088]  So they created a file on me, and the Congressional Oversight Committee wanted to get the file.
[00:41:39.088 --> 00:41:52.173]  But the FBI kept saying, we can't give it because it has the names of confidential informants, it'll inhibit our ability to do our work, national security is at stake, the case is still pending, all lies.
[00:41:52.173 --> 00:41:55.395]  And when you get the file, and they finally got a redacted version of it,
[00:41:56.155 --> 00:42:01.679]  But then when you look in the file, you see the reason why they were so reluctant to cough it up.
[00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:09.604]  And the answer is, right in the file, it says, Dinesh D'Souza is a right-wing provocateur who made a movie critical of the Obama administration.
[00:42:09.604 --> 00:42:14.507]  In other words, my political bona fides are in the file.
[00:42:14.507 --> 00:42:20.852]  And the FBI highlighted that to signal to the Holder Justice Department, hey, here's a political enemy.
[00:42:20.852 --> 00:42:22.733]  You may want to go after this guy.
[00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:24.394]  So this is the dirty stuff
[00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:25.455]  Exactly!
[00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:29.637]  Even MSNBC when they were persecuting tens of thousands of Christians with the IRS said, well of course we are!
[00:42:29.637 --> 00:42:30.657]  You're racist!
[00:42:30.657 --> 00:42:32.898]  They just dehumanize us like the Nazis did.
[00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:35.239]  They persecute us, but I think the worm's turning.
[00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:39.021]  And you agree though that we can't take the, you know, not take the gloves off now.
[00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:42.123]  We have to go after them because they've actually committed the crimes.
[00:42:43.638 --> 00:42:46.942]  Yes, I think, you know, we don't want to become like them.
[00:42:46.942 --> 00:42:51.426]  I don't think you'd necessarily have to fight gangsterism by becoming a gangster.
[00:42:51.426 --> 00:42:55.050]  But on the other hand, you do have to fight gangsterism by becoming tough.
[00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.852]  And you do have to enforce the law.
[00:42:56.852 --> 00:42:57.272]  That's right.
[00:42:57.272 --> 00:42:58.273]  Dinesh D'Souza, amazing.
[00:42:58.273 --> 00:42:58.554]  Thank you.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.361]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.361 --> 00:43:06.642]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.642 --> 00:43:12.904]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:15.685]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:20.248]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.248 --> 00:43:26.712]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.712 --> 00:43:31.676]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.423 --> 00:43:36.346]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:43.550]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.253]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:54.457]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:58.440]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.614 --> 00:44:04.458]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:13.365]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.365 --> 00:44:18.709]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:13.332]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:13.332 --> 00:45:16.194]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:16.194 --> 00:45:17.694]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:20.816]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:21.036 --> 00:45:24.499]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.499 --> 00:45:26.581]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:36.289]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[00:47:03.385 --> 00:47:06.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.596 --> 00:47:31.120]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.341]  Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people!
[00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:34.881]  RACIST!
[00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:36.022]  The economy's coming back!
[00:47:36.022 --> 00:47:37.562]  RACIST!
[00:47:37.562 --> 00:47:40.824]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms!
[00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.004]  RACIST!
[00:47:42.004 --> 00:47:45.906]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[00:47:45.906 --> 00:47:46.086]  RACIST!
[00:47:47.106 --> 00:47:48.267]  RACIST!
[00:47:48.267 --> 00:47:52.689]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[00:47:52.689 --> 00:47:53.990]  It must be racist!
[00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:57.092]  MSRT can't torture little girls to death for Satan!
[00:47:57.092 --> 00:47:58.253]  RACIST!
[00:47:58.253 --> 00:48:02.175]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[00:48:02.175 --> 00:48:03.056]  RACIST!
[00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:16.672]  People asked on the internet, as I was looking at YouTube this morning, as that meme goes viral, they said, was that edited?
[00:48:16.672 --> 00:48:19.314]  And I'm like, no, that's live.
[00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:20.675]  And did you guys script that?
[00:48:20.675 --> 00:48:21.295]  No.
[00:48:21.295 --> 00:48:36.364]  That's why Owen's so great, is that we can riff off each other as the joke, because there's so many good things happening, and then that's all mainstream corporate media does, is just increase racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist!
[00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:40.300]  And speaking of that, Starbucks training.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:46.584]  Employees forced to watch video after video of white cops attacking blacks.
[00:48:46.584 --> 00:48:54.047]  Imagine if you made workers watch videos of black people attacking white people in racially motivated attacks.
[00:48:54.047 --> 00:48:58.229]  I mean, it happens on both sides, but it is about 10 times more often black on white.
[00:48:58.229 --> 00:48:59.850]  That's FBI numbers.
[00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:00.751]  And that's done because
[00:49:02.668 --> 00:49:07.330]  Some of the leftist groups, the new Black Panther party head, I've had him on from Houston.
[00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:12.893]  He said in the newspaper, don't go engage in crime in the black area, go mug a white person.
[00:49:12.893 --> 00:49:14.994]  Remember that a few years ago?
[00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:18.636]  That story's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:49:18.636 --> 00:49:21.738]  It's an excellent information liberation article.
[00:49:21.738 --> 00:49:23.939]  It's got our video and report with the whistleblower in it.
[00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:29.002]  Starbucks training employees forced to watch video after video of white cops attacking blacks.
[00:49:30.282 --> 00:49:33.784]  You know the number one killer of blacks is black folks, right?
[00:49:33.784 --> 00:49:34.745]  And I wish it wasn't happening.
[00:49:34.745 --> 00:49:37.446]  Well, number one after abortuaries, I'm sorry.
[00:49:37.446 --> 00:49:43.649]  Many areas, over 70% of blacks get aborted, but the average is down to like 47%, Reverend Schultz has corrected me.
[00:49:43.649 --> 00:49:44.370]  He was on a few weeks ago.
[00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.692]  We want to get him back on, by the way.
[00:49:47.692 --> 00:49:51.654]  He exposes the genocide going on against black people particularly, but
[00:49:53.578 --> 00:50:04.346]  You look at this, I mean, imagine if a company said, we're worried about racism, so we're going to show you black people on world star hip-hop site doing the knockout game.
[00:50:04.346 --> 00:50:07.868]  And these people died after they were hitting their head at the concrete.
[00:50:07.868 --> 00:50:14.393]  Or we're going to show you black folks coming in and saying all this racist stuff and shooting people.
[00:50:14.393 --> 00:50:18.596]  Can you imagine that?
[00:50:18.596 --> 00:50:19.457]  Can you imagine?
[00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:21.838]  I mean, that is nothing but to create racial division.
[00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:22.499]  That's coming up.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:34.104]  Some of the other guests we've got, remember the 30-year-old teenager that would move out of his parents' house that got kicked out by the court last week and he came in studio?
[00:50:34.104 --> 00:50:40.126]  Mike Rotondo is going to be joining us coming up today.
[00:50:40.126 --> 00:50:41.046]  He'll be popping in.
[00:50:41.046 --> 00:50:44.148]  Is that going to be on Skype or phone?
[00:50:44.148 --> 00:50:47.509]  Oh, good, because we don't want to lose any of the effect.
[00:50:47.509 --> 00:50:51.090]  And he's thanked me and USA Today, saying he's now moved out of the house.
[00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.171]  People said, oh, why'd you give him $3,000?
[00:50:54.517 --> 00:51:08.127]  Just because I did it voluntarily, ladies and gentlemen, and because no one else was giving him any money, and they were just saying, look at this slob, but not making a big deal out of people having to pay for abortions in many counties, like Travis County, where I live.
[00:51:08.127 --> 00:51:11.130]  You have to pay for that as a taxpayer.
[00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:19.296]  In many other areas, people have to pay millions and millions and millions and millions a year in San Francisco for thousands over the years of sex changes.
[00:51:19.296 --> 00:51:22.678]  You just move to San Francisco, you want to have a sex change.
[00:51:23.578 --> 00:51:25.900]  And then I gotta pay for it?
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:31.046]  So, again, I just wanted to really investigate this guy, and not just see him one-dimensionally.
[00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:44.300]  And I gotta say, I think he's a little autistic behaving, because he's got that same kind of satisfied, stupid intelligence, because he's smart, he's witty, but at the same time, you can't get through to him.
[00:51:47.256 --> 00:51:54.620]  So, we'll see what happens with him, but he always wants the perfect thing to do, and he can never figure out exactly what it is he's going to do.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.340]  And that's the problem.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.322]  You need to just get out there in life and take the bull by the horns.
[00:51:59.322 --> 00:52:09.848]  You know, if the star cheerleader doesn't want to go out with you, because she's a senior and you're a freshman, then move on.
[00:52:09.848 --> 00:52:13.710]  Don't end up never dating a girl because you were scared of rejection.
[00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:18.713]  By the way, you might find out the little nerd girls a lot more fun than the star cheerleader.
[00:52:18.713 --> 00:52:21.055]  So, you know, that's what this stuff comes down to.
[00:52:21.055 --> 00:52:22.796]  But I digress.
[00:52:22.796 --> 00:52:28.160]  I want to get into the really positive news when we start the next hour.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:33.264]  And I really want you to join me for this because Trump is for real.
[00:52:33.264 --> 00:52:34.204]  He isn't out to get us.
[00:52:34.204 --> 00:52:35.565]  He really believes in Americana.
[00:52:35.565 --> 00:52:36.566]  He really wants free market.
[00:52:36.566 --> 00:52:38.327]  Doesn't mean he isn't kind of a strong man.
[00:52:38.327 --> 00:52:40.189]  Doesn't mean that, you know, he isn't.
[00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:44.177]  Have some issues with military dalliances.
[00:52:44.177 --> 00:52:52.341]  But he's really got the tiger by the tail and has so far been steering it with masterful aplomb.
[00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:57.963]  And this is Providence happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:57.963 --> 00:53:03.186]  And the position is really polishing him out.
[00:53:03.186 --> 00:53:08.889]  And I see something really, really strong coming out of Trump.
[00:53:08.889 --> 00:53:10.490]  And the more we get behind him, the better.
[00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:17.021]  If we desert him because he can't do 100% of what we want, enemy forces will slide into the gap.
[00:53:17.021 --> 00:53:18.903]  But they hate Trump legitimately.
[00:53:18.903 --> 00:53:24.066]  I saw a photo yesterday that I wanted to tweet out.
[00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:25.267]  Then I got locked out on my Twitter.
[00:53:25.267 --> 00:53:30.691]  I had to change the passcode because somebody was sending unauthorized stuff in my name.
[00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:32.993]  And so I couldn't tweet it.
[00:53:32.993 --> 00:53:34.074]  Let me see if I can find it.
[00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:42.363]  Maybe show it on my phone to TV viewers, but just this image of Trump, I think is the most iconic.
[00:53:42.363 --> 00:53:45.645]  I think really captures him.
[00:53:45.645 --> 00:53:46.866]  See if I can find it.
[00:53:46.866 --> 00:53:47.586]  We'll go to it in a minute.
[00:53:47.586 --> 00:53:50.108]  I want to find this shot in HD.
[00:53:50.108 --> 00:54:04.777]  I think this shot right here, because he looks really old and he looks completely dedicated and you can see the determination and how he's giving himself completely to this and killing himself.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.464]  That's the real Trump right there.
[00:54:10.464 --> 00:54:12.645]  He's killing himself.
[00:54:12.645 --> 00:54:14.487]  And they know he's got a good spirit.
[00:54:14.487 --> 00:54:17.249]  And he is working 18 hours a day, giving it his 110%.
[00:54:17.249 --> 00:54:21.593]  Something I can't even do at 44 years old.
[00:54:21.593 --> 00:54:23.114]  And I'm known for energy.
[00:54:23.114 --> 00:54:24.596]  And that's Trump right there.
[00:54:24.596 --> 00:54:27.618]  And he is, like he said, he changed during the campaign.
[00:54:27.618 --> 00:54:29.440]  And he changed even more.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.823]  And this really is America's chance at reprieve.
[00:54:34.377 --> 00:54:35.418]  That photo right there.
[00:54:35.418 --> 00:54:37.179]  I want to get that photo.
[00:54:37.179 --> 00:54:39.501]  I want to blow it up and put it on the wall.
[00:54:39.501 --> 00:54:43.545]  Because I'm telling you folks, you know a man by his enemies.
[00:54:43.545 --> 00:54:47.208]  And you know how much they hate him because they know how real he is.
[00:54:47.208 --> 00:54:52.492]  Turns out Obama's been spying on him the whole eight years.
[00:54:52.492 --> 00:54:56.996]  And Trump knows all about the pedophiles and the globalists and the devil worshippers and the whole thing.
[00:54:59.446 --> 00:55:03.327]  And he's really trying his best because they wanted destabilization in North Korea.
[00:55:03.327 --> 00:55:05.167]  They want destabilization worldwide.
[00:55:05.167 --> 00:55:07.168]  They want society falling apart.
[00:55:07.168 --> 00:55:08.928]  They want us to be on Prozac.
[00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:11.149]  They want us to be depressed.
[00:55:11.149 --> 00:55:12.769]  It's in their own documents.
[00:55:12.769 --> 00:55:16.110]  The heads of Facebook have gone public and said, I was wrong.
[00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:18.250]  We designed it to depress you and hurt you.
[00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:19.650]  And I apologize.
[00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.491]  Sean Parker, you won't get that out of Zuckerberg.
[00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:25.132]  I got a big stack of articles here.
[00:55:25.132 --> 00:55:27.072]  Tech titans tiptoe towards monopoly.
[00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:38.598]  And they admit, even in the Wall Street Journal, that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon want a monopoly and want to shut everybody else down.
[00:55:38.598 --> 00:55:40.499]  No wonder they push race war.
[00:55:40.499 --> 00:55:45.980]  They are so villainous, people.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.401]  It's all coming up.
[00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:51.622]  And it's serious.
[00:55:51.622 --> 00:55:55.123]  And Trump is just simply trying to give us a fair shake.
[00:55:56.363 --> 00:56:04.045]  By a group of corporate globalists that are teaching Americans how to hate themselves, how to hate their country, and how to disintegrate.
[00:56:04.045 --> 00:56:09.406]  They were going to bring us down when Hillary got in so bad and have culture and race and sexist wars.
[00:56:09.406 --> 00:56:12.007]  And they're still going ahead with the plan even though she was defeated.
[00:56:12.007 --> 00:56:16.868]  And it's consciously evil.
[00:56:16.868 --> 00:56:23.750]  And that's why they changed the subject to Russia and to Julian Assange and to Alex Jones and to Roger Stone because they got their butt handed to them in the election.
[00:56:24.793 --> 00:56:35.897]  And it got proven that they're in there getting foreign funding from the Chinese Communists, and the Vatican, and the EU, and Hollywood, by the billions, and that they have a culture of hating America.
[00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:37.838]  Because they're tyrants!
[00:56:37.838 --> 00:56:46.541]  Because they know there's a spark in America of free market, and self-defense, and 57 Chevys, and you know, all of it.
[00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:52.763]  And Muhammad Ali, and Marilyn Monroe, they know there's something special in America, that real melting pot.
[00:56:55.029 --> 00:57:00.654]  They want us to be domesticated and stupid and fearful.
[00:57:00.654 --> 00:57:03.137]  It's their plan, and they failed.
[00:57:03.137 --> 00:57:05.860]  They bet wrong.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:10.804]  So we gotta be all in right now, ladies and gentlemen, and move forward.
[00:57:10.804 --> 00:57:12.066]  And it's spreading all over the world.
[00:57:13.117 --> 00:57:19.623]  We have some big challenges coming down the road with the AI and all the rest of it and population and out of control, you know, tech giants and all of it.
[00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:24.068]  But at least we're starting to wake up out of the coma and have got a shot.
[00:57:24.068 --> 00:57:32.817]  Whatever you do, if you're listening on local radio, watching on local TV or reading our news articles or watching us on live streams on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, please spread those live links.

[00:57:37.481 --> 00:57:43.233]  On internet, I want to go free to air on radio soon where everybody can take commercials, because I just want to reach people.
[00:57:43.233 --> 00:57:44.255]  Second hour coming up.
[00:57:44.255 --> 00:57:47.902]  Please, have you told somebody to listen today to bypass the censors?
[00:57:53.343 --> 00:57:59.046]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:06.931]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.931 --> 00:58:10.093]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:10.273 --> 00:58:15.558]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:18.321]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[00:58:27.469 --> 00:58:39.324]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[00:58:50.168 --> 00:58:57.134]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[00:58:57.134 --> 00:59:05.900]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.
[00:59:06.861 --> 00:59:20.889]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.

[00:59:30.655 --> 00:59:32.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:05.064]  You think abortions from rape are a high number?
[01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:15.106]  And nobody's saying make it illegal.
[01:00:15.106 --> 01:00:18.627]  Wow.
[01:00:18.627 --> 01:00:24.848]  Someone on here taking time to watch this feed and put in a comment that she hopes trucks run us over.
[01:00:24.848 --> 01:00:26.349]  That's the liberal mentality.
[01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:27.729]  I don't like you, I hope you die.
[01:00:29.432 --> 01:00:30.793]  Hey, I'm willing to debate.
[01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.874]  How you like me now?
[01:00:33.874 --> 01:00:35.715]  How you like me now?
[01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.396]  How you like me now?
[01:00:37.396 --> 01:00:38.536]  How you like me now?
[01:00:38.536 --> 01:00:40.937]  How you like me now?
[01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:43.118]  How you like me now?
[01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:46.920]  How you like me now?
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.842]  How you like me now?
[01:00:49.842 --> 01:00:50.482]  I remember!
[01:01:07.352 --> 01:01:09.013]  Yeah, let's put the live feed up.
[01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:22.998]  I should have told you during the last hour, I said Dinesh D'Souza on, I got distracted, that Owen Troyer and Rob Dew and some of the crew went down to the biggest abortuary in Central Texas.
[01:01:22.998 --> 01:01:24.318]  It's off of 290 Eastbound.
[01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:31.826]  Right before I-35.
[01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:37.250]  And it looks like a few dozen or so supporters, we just plugged it once yesterday on air, showed up.
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.391]  And we can show you the sign.
[01:01:38.391 --> 01:01:39.212]  Government funding.
[01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:40.373]  Planned Farenthood.
[01:01:40.373 --> 01:01:41.954]  500 million a year.
[01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:45.137]  And they've killed millions of people.
[01:01:45.137 --> 01:01:47.519]  NRA?
[01:01:47.519 --> 01:01:48.580]  Zero government funding.
[01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:54.396]  So it just shows you where the real death is and what's really going on.
[01:01:54.396 --> 01:01:58.360]  And when we showed up out there a couple years ago, we plugged it about a week out.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:06.146]  That's why the communists showed up, who also then proceeded to tell us that they killed their kids, that they were devil worshipers.
[01:02:06.146 --> 01:02:07.367]  So it was quite interesting.
[01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:10.550]  So do see some of the comments when we just launched this feed.
[01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:13.813]  We'll post a live feed, InfoWars NRA.
[01:02:16.209 --> 01:02:24.536]  You know, protest the, uh, I don't know what they're calling the event, but InfoWars protest Planned Parenthood death camp.
[01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:26.858]  Maybe post that to InfoWars.com if folks want to watch the feed.
[01:02:26.858 --> 01:02:29.220]  And they usually cap us on Facebook.
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:34.285]  We used to do Facebook Live and it would get the average video about a million views.
[01:02:34.285 --> 01:02:39.810]  And Facebook reached out to me and they said, come up to New York and meet with some Facebook executives and don't be mean to Zuckerberg and play ball.
[01:02:40.973 --> 01:02:45.698]  And then when we didn't, they dialed it back to 100,000 could watch, and then now it's like 1,000 can watch, but it doesn't matter.
[01:02:45.698 --> 01:02:52.664]  Everybody else grabs it and routinely it goes viral, and hundreds of thousands or millions see it, because you can't stop the signal, but it always caps at about 680-something people.
[01:02:55.302 --> 01:02:58.483]  No matter how many want to tune in, everybody says it kicks them off, it won't let them.
[01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:01.044]  But anyways, the feed just went live.
[01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:02.105]  Let's go to a few minutes of it.
[01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:06.046]  People are in the comments saying, we hope trucks run you over and kill you.
[01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:07.267]  Oh, I know, you're such liberals.
[01:03:07.267 --> 01:03:17.090]  You care about children so much that you want people to have a government-funded assisted suicide, but don't want people to have the right who are terminally ill to take experimental treatments.
[01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:17.570]  They can save them.
[01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:20.191]  Because you people are part of a death cult.
[01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:21.512]  You're control freak rats.
[01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:25.888]  Let's continue here with this live feed right now.
[01:03:25.888 --> 01:03:26.128]  Here we go.
[01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:39.685]  Because that's what they're doing.
[01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:45.467]  They're spending our tax money on, not just on illegal wars that we've been doing for many years, you know.
[01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:46.588]  We've been doing that.
[01:03:46.588 --> 01:03:49.749]  Not declaring war on people and setting up bases in their countries.
[01:03:49.749 --> 01:03:57.231]  But, you know, $500 million a year goes to Planned Parenthood from our federal government to basically, you know, kill babies.
[01:03:57.231 --> 01:04:01.812]  Because Planned Parenthood likes to say that, oh, we do all kinds of women's health things.
[01:04:01.812 --> 01:04:03.113]  And they do do some of that.
[01:04:04.011 --> 01:04:09.096]  But when you have people call them up and ask for ultrasounds and stuff like that, they're like, oh no, we don't do that.
[01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:09.957]  We don't do that.
[01:04:09.957 --> 01:04:11.779]  Even though they say ultrasound is one of our main things.
[01:04:11.779 --> 01:04:15.282]  Alright, we'll continue to give you some shots out there, but nice families.
[01:04:15.282 --> 01:04:16.904]  Go interview the lady, dude.
[01:04:16.904 --> 01:04:17.425]  With her daughter.
[01:04:17.425 --> 01:04:18.165]  That's interesting.
[01:04:18.165 --> 01:04:23.611]  This guy's interesting too, but... We will come back in a little while with more of that.
[01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:25.052]  Here with Owen Schroyer, has to say.
[01:04:25.052 --> 01:04:26.714]  I guess he's probably out there with a live feed as well.
[01:04:26.714 --> 01:04:27.655]  We haven't seen Owen yet.
[01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:36.731]  Blackest of the black, dark of the night, come to me my bleeding light.
[01:04:36.731 --> 01:04:41.854]  Soon she comes, she comes now, into her oblivion.
[01:04:41.854 --> 01:04:45.377]  How about we actually try to save some shoulder by getting out there right now?
[01:04:45.377 --> 01:04:47.538]  We'll be back.
[01:04:47.538 --> 01:04:50.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:08.074]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:08.074 --> 01:05:12.775]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:17.557]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.557 --> 01:05:20.598]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:05:20.598 --> 01:05:23.019]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:26.580]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.841]  Winner's Sun is the result
[01:05:27.981 --> 01:05:28.401]  We're good to go.
[01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:09.530]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:19.577]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[01:06:19.577 --> 01:06:21.719]  How many did I adopt?
[01:06:21.719 --> 01:06:23.040]  I kill my kids!
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.221]  I kill my kids!
[01:06:28.975 --> 01:06:35.181]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[01:06:35.181 --> 01:06:37.143]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:40.926]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[01:06:40.926 --> 01:06:43.269]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:44.710]  I don't think so.
[01:06:47.412 --> 01:06:51.217]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:06:51.217 --> 01:06:53.060]  I pay for them.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.162]  Upwards of 50.
[01:06:55.162 --> 01:06:55.583]  Really?
[01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:56.424]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.331]  You, you piece of s***!
[01:07:07.331 --> 01:07:09.152]  Bunch of misogynist motherf***ers!
[01:07:09.152 --> 01:07:11.172]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[01:07:11.172 --> 01:07:13.293]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[01:07:13.293 --> 01:07:18.254]  I'm being aggressive?
[01:07:18.254 --> 01:07:29.917]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[01:07:29.917 --> 01:07:34.958]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:48.158]  And right now, that was a couple years ago, when the Commie Devil Whispers showed up to protest us when we were having a pro-life rally outside the biggest mortuary in Central Texas, where Owen Schroer and the crew are today.
[01:07:48.158 --> 01:07:53.962]  But the Commie Devil Whispers didn't show up today, because they got their butt handed to them last time, politically.
[01:07:53.962 --> 01:07:56.823]  When they physically attacked us, they were made to look like idiots.
[01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.384]  We're going to be going to Owen here in a few minutes.
[01:07:58.384 --> 01:08:01.786]  But first, drumroll please!
[01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.828]  I told you two weeks ago,
[01:08:04.994 --> 01:08:21.644]  From sources in the meeting with Kudlow and the President, that when the new quarter comes out, because you get the quarterly numbers after the quarter ends, it would be at 4%.
[01:08:21.644 --> 01:08:24.325]  But that they wanted to be careful and not overestimate it.
[01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:27.027]  Well, guess what?
[01:08:27.027 --> 01:08:28.488]  May jobless rate is at 3.8%.
[01:08:28.488 --> 01:08:30.509]  Black unemployment at a record low.
[01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:40.587]  And the word is very, very soon you're gonna hear of the 4.0.
[01:08:40.587 --> 01:08:43.568]  The word is it may even be higher.
[01:08:43.568 --> 01:08:45.788]  They said conservatively, 4%.
[01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:53.869]  Remember, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Barack Obama, they all said you'll never get to three.
[01:08:53.869 --> 01:08:55.230]  Obama never got to three.
[01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.190]  He said, what are you gonna do?
[01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:56.950]  Wave a magic wand.
[01:08:56.950 --> 01:09:00.951]  Can we pull up the magic wand quote, please?
[01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:02.871]  The magic wand quote.
[01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:07.805]  You know, these sycophant globalists love power.
[01:09:07.805 --> 01:09:11.749]  I could care less about Hollywood or power or all that crap.
[01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:20.357]  But I savor patriots having a foothold in the swamp and having Trump.
[01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:20.938]  I savor it.
[01:09:23.843 --> 01:09:43.193]  And they are just pulling their hair out because they want to run our lives, brainwash our kids, deny us medical care, put us into the death panels, case for killing granny, Bill Gates all of them and admit it, and then they say, oh, Trump's bad for letting people get experimental care of their facing death.
[01:09:43.193 --> 01:09:43.693]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:09:43.693 --> 01:09:46.995]  Here's Obama saying Trump cannot wave a magic wand.
[01:09:46.995 --> 01:09:48.336]  Right now, growth is what?
[01:09:48.336 --> 01:09:48.356]  3.3?
[01:09:48.356 --> 01:09:49.236]  Estimates are?
[01:09:52.958 --> 01:10:00.883]  Internally from the White House, 4 to 4.1, maybe even 4.2 when the numbers come out in about a month.
[01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:10.230]  And remember, you heard it here first, next year's news today, tomorrow's news today, the dreaded InfoWars.
[01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:14.312]  Here's Obama saying, huh, what's Trump going to have some magic wand?
[01:10:14.312 --> 01:10:15.873]  Besides, he's never going to be president.
[01:10:15.873 --> 01:10:17.995]  Remember Alec Baldwin?
[01:10:17.995 --> 01:10:20.596]  Oh, Alec Baldwin, you're very useful to me.
[01:10:24.673 --> 01:10:30.175]  We now take you live.
[01:10:30.175 --> 01:10:31.896]  What they call in Team America, FAG?
[01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:33.556]  And it stood for something?
[01:10:33.556 --> 01:10:39.918]  Uh, like the, um... Yeah, yeah, the What Actors Guild?
[01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:41.359]  Yeah, Film Actors Guild.
[01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:42.979]  We now take you live to FAG.
[01:10:42.979 --> 01:10:47.541]  And then, Kim Jong-il goes, Ah, Alec Baldwin!
[01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:50.922]  He goes, Yes sir, I'll take care of it right away, sir.
[01:10:50.922 --> 01:10:53.143]  I mean, you're not getting what you want.
[01:10:54.019 --> 01:11:02.424]  And then symbolically, it's Michael Moore with the explosives, trying to blow up the Team America.
[01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:08.788]  So here is Obama saying, you can't have cars, you can't have TVs, you can't have air conditioning to Africans.
[01:11:08.788 --> 01:11:09.188]  Remember that?
[01:11:09.188 --> 01:11:11.770]  But he also says, you just can't wave a magic wand.
[01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:14.151]  Well, it's not a magic wand.
[01:11:14.151 --> 01:11:21.836]  If I've been chained up in a prison for my life, you know, in shackles for 10 years, and then you take me out of the shackles that I can now walk around.
[01:11:23.339 --> 01:11:26.020]  In fact, let's hear a message from Fagg first.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:29.301]  Sean Penn and others.
[01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:30.681]  Download that, I want to play it.
[01:11:30.681 --> 01:11:36.263]  Oh, and I love how it's going to be all over George Soros Media Matters today.
[01:11:36.263 --> 01:11:38.244]  Jones and another homophobic rant.
[01:11:38.244 --> 01:11:43.125]  Oh, but you don't say that about New America because they are South Park folks in Hollywood.
[01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:44.946]  Even though they're a different vein to that and I tend to like them.
[01:11:45.933 --> 01:11:47.033]  They're irreverent.
[01:11:47.033 --> 01:11:48.294]  They have a right to make the joke.
[01:11:48.294 --> 01:11:49.374]  It's funny.
[01:11:49.374 --> 01:11:50.814]  And I'm going to make the joke.
[01:11:50.814 --> 01:11:55.695]  Not because I hate people that have different lifestyles than others.
[01:11:55.695 --> 01:11:56.415]  It's ridiculous.
[01:11:56.415 --> 01:11:58.776]  But I will play stuff like this.
[01:11:58.776 --> 01:12:05.157]  You know, I didn't used to because I'm a more serious broadcast, but I'm going to start playing stuff like this because I'm going to do what I want.
[01:12:05.157 --> 01:12:11.879]  I'm going to exercise the First Amendment and you're going to get used to it, George Soros, you evil scrotum head.
[01:12:13.305 --> 01:12:15.046]  It's a self-propelled scrotum.
[01:12:15.046 --> 01:12:19.810]  Have you seen him in France three days ago, trying to have the EU take over and have authoritarianism?
[01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:23.493]  And he just looked like a big old rotting bag of pus.
[01:12:23.493 --> 01:12:24.174]  Excuse me.
[01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:25.134]  Let's go to Obama.
[01:12:25.134 --> 01:12:26.315]  Here it is.
[01:12:26.315 --> 01:12:36.623]  When somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:12:36.623 --> 01:12:38.004]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[01:12:38.004 --> 01:12:38.605]  What are you going to do?
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.981]  There's no answer to it.
[01:12:42.981 --> 01:12:47.523]  He just says, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[01:12:47.523 --> 01:12:50.565]  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:53.187]  What magic wand do you have?
[01:12:53.187 --> 01:12:57.770]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:08.376]  And of course, within months it all turned around because they were artificially, I'm going to use the analogy again.
[01:13:08.376 --> 01:13:09.217]  I've done this myself.
[01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:12.868]  You got your boat tied up.
[01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:15.108]  You're getting gas.
[01:13:15.108 --> 01:13:16.409]  You're tied up in two or three places.
[01:13:16.409 --> 01:13:17.909]  You start driving off.
[01:13:17.909 --> 01:13:20.470]  You forgot one and the boat's like, and it won't move.
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.311]  You go, Oh, I'm tied up in the dock.
[01:13:22.311 --> 01:13:25.252]  So Trump went over and said, America, it's okay for you to have jobs.
[01:13:25.252 --> 01:13:27.152]  He called a bunch of corporations said, move back.
[01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:29.773]  He said, Hey, we're going to get lower taxes here on corporations.
[01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.514]  So you don't, you know, move overseas.
[01:13:31.514 --> 01:13:32.294]  And all of a sudden,
[01:13:34.045 --> 01:13:39.752]  It'd be like if you had your sunroof open and it was raining and water was falling on you, and Obama goes, oh, what are you going to do?
[01:13:39.752 --> 01:13:41.734]  Wave a magic wand to close that sunroof?
[01:13:41.734 --> 01:13:42.395]  And I'm like, no.
[01:13:42.395 --> 01:13:46.180]  I just hit the button.
[01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:52.764]  And that's how dumb they think you are.
[01:13:52.764 --> 01:13:55.225]  So let's hear that from Obama one more time.
[01:13:55.225 --> 01:14:00.848]  Then we're going to go to Owen Schroer live at the abortuary, outside of it, making some great points.
[01:14:00.848 --> 01:14:05.750]  Here, let's go ahead now and play Obama again, one more time, two years ago.
[01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.510]  Here it is.
[01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:17.256]  And when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:14:17.256 --> 01:14:18.657]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[01:14:18.657 --> 01:14:19.257]  What are you going to do?
[01:14:22.008 --> 01:14:23.629]  There's no answer to it.
[01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:28.173]  He just says, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[01:14:28.173 --> 01:14:31.215]  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:14:31.215 --> 01:14:32.556]  What magic wand do you have?
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.521]  And usually the answer is, you don't have to.
[01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:37.621]  I'm going to stop there.
[01:14:37.621 --> 01:14:39.461]  I love the power trip of Obama.
[01:14:39.461 --> 01:14:45.443]  I'm not, even when Trump was in the lead then, as the lead candidate, I'm not even going to dignify and give him advertisement.
[01:14:45.443 --> 01:14:49.724]  The power trip that, oh, you're so important, Obama.
[01:14:49.724 --> 01:14:53.044]  And then they say Obama was shell-shocked when Trump won.
[01:14:53.044 --> 01:14:56.065]  And Ben Rhodes, there's that video that just got released from him that night, he can't talk.
[01:14:58.322 --> 01:15:00.823]  These people are control freaks.
[01:15:00.823 --> 01:15:02.243]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:15:02.243 --> 01:15:06.384]  I told you Trump would win if we could stop the election fraud.
[01:15:06.384 --> 01:15:21.367]  They stole six states, tried to steal five, but Homeland Security locally caught Homeland Security breaking into the computers and in live time blocked them in five states.
[01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:22.448]  Of course they were trying to steal.
[01:15:22.448 --> 01:15:23.708]  They stole the nomination from Bernie.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.362]  They don't always like to be poor.
[01:15:29.362 --> 01:15:30.982]  My buddy Sanders, very smart.
[01:15:30.982 --> 01:15:38.225]  So when we come back we'll have Ben Rhodes all sad and we'll go to Owen Schreier live on the scene.
[01:15:38.225 --> 01:15:40.966]  It's all coming up today.
[01:15:40.966 --> 01:15:42.366]  We're going to win, win, win.
[01:15:42.366 --> 01:15:46.588]  You're going to get so tired of winning you're going to say please stop and we're not going to do it.
[01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:48.368]  Bing bing bong bong bing.
[01:15:48.368 --> 01:15:50.049]  Bing bing bong bong bing.
[01:15:50.049 --> 01:15:51.729]  Bing bing bong bong bing.

[01:17:58.342 --> 01:18:05.986]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:18:05.986 --> 01:18:13.890]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.992]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:18:17.612 --> 01:18:22.257]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:18:22.257 --> 01:18:26.382]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:18:26.382 --> 01:18:29.545]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:18:29.545 --> 01:18:34.310]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:37.314]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:52.842]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.

[01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:03.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:16.525]  The answer to 1984.
[01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:17.726]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:17.726 --> 01:20:30.295]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.295 --> 01:20:36.359]  Savannah Hernandez is out there as well with Owen Schroyer and Rob Dew at the abortuary.
[01:20:36.359 --> 01:20:38.381]  She's talking to some of the crowd.
[01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:41.463]  We're gonna pop in and hear what she has to say, then I'm gonna get into
[01:20:43.103 --> 01:20:52.768]  The devastating success that Trump's having bringing the country back from the dead because we had a bunch of globalist vampires drinking our blood!
[01:20:52.768 --> 01:20:57.690]  Imagine about a thousand little vampire bats supping on us and Trump's already kicked about half of them off.
[01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:04.734]  They're hopping around, biting him, crapping themselves, flipping out, rolling around, having little fits of anger.
[01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:08.336]  But he just every day is just basically swatting more of them off.
[01:21:09.813 --> 01:21:14.818]  Some of them are flying up against the wall and breaking their backs and then vomiting up the blood they stole and flipping out in it.
[01:21:14.818 --> 01:21:20.584]  I mean, they're just, just think of the Democrats as little demonic vampire bats having convulsions.
[01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:25.989]  Let's go to Savannah Hernandez and hear who she's talking to in Austin at the abortuary that we're there exposing.
[01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:26.269]  Go ahead.
[01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:30.534]  Outside of that, I can't really find a justification for murdering babies.
[01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:48.612]  At the same time, I would really appreciate it if pro-life groups or those who are generally opposed to the practice of abortion would help crowdfund medical science to the point where we can increase the date of viability for the unborn.
[01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:53.794]  Because while I do believe that women should have a choice to evict
[01:21:54.854 --> 01:21:56.074]  I've never heard that idea!
[01:21:56.074 --> 01:21:56.454]  Wow, a new idea!
[01:22:17.964 --> 01:22:21.947]  Going back to Owen Fine, I mean, what were our stats that we put up here, Owen?
[01:22:21.947 --> 01:22:29.773]  I think we put that 75 million children are killed from Planned Parenthood and the NRA has killed zero.
[01:22:29.773 --> 01:22:36.218]  I mean, you know, a lot of people do argue that the NRA, all the blood of the children, mass shootings, it's on their hands.
[01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:38.360]  What do you have to say about that as a gun owner?
[01:22:39.986 --> 01:22:51.193]  Well, I mean, I'm no real fan of the NRA anyway, but I don't think they've ever murdered anybody, and I feel like it's just unfair to paint them as that kind of an organization.
[01:22:51.193 --> 01:22:56.977]  I feel it's, uh, the type of personal attack that... He's got a gun on his head like the NRA?
[01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:58.678]  ...doesn't have a real argument.
[01:22:58.678 --> 01:23:02.180]  I feel like the left really demonizes gun owners, you know?
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.662]  Meanwhile, they're promoting the killing of millions of babies.
[01:23:04.662 --> 01:23:09.105]  I mean, like, as a gun owner in America, I guess, like, how do you feel about that?
[01:23:09.605 --> 01:23:13.708]  Well, I mean, I don't really believe it's just the left that's doing that either.
[01:23:13.708 --> 01:23:21.894]  I feel like the right is also promoting a whole lot of child murder in the form of the wars that the United States engages in across the world.
[01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:24.656]  And that's both a left and a right thing.
[01:23:24.656 --> 01:23:28.920]  So, if you're gonna care about babies, you should care about the weather and not in the
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:29.840]  I don't know.
[01:23:51.306 --> 01:23:58.728]  An I-35 on the west side of I-35, on the eastbound side of the frontage road.
[01:23:58.728 --> 01:24:00.248]  You really can't miss it.
[01:24:00.248 --> 01:24:03.308]  Planned Parenthood protests in Austin.
[01:24:03.308 --> 01:24:09.690]  And it is 201 East Bend White Boulevard, Building B, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:16.011]  Okay, now getting back to the collapse of the globalists.
[01:24:17.768 --> 01:24:18.488]  Unprecedented!
[01:24:18.488 --> 01:24:23.689]  Trump aims to defy midterm campaign history.
[01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:25.689]  And then the even bigger news.
[01:24:25.689 --> 01:24:33.711]  Trey Gowdy's recent activity highlights deep state action against Devin Nunes.
[01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:36.671]  It's now being confirmed and we've got indictments being readied.
[01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:43.473]  That's even in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post for McCabe.
[01:24:43.473 --> 01:24:44.833]  So this circle in the wagons
[01:24:46.747 --> 01:24:51.131]  These federal prosecutors and these Clinton people and even some of these conservatives have been playing a double game.
[01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:54.854]  It's coming to an end.
[01:24:54.854 --> 01:24:58.977]  So we're going to review what Trey Gowdy's really done versus his rhetoric.
[01:24:58.977 --> 01:25:00.538]  Coming up, start of the next segment.
[01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:08.525]  But since I mentioned it, we mentioned Ben Rhodes, one of the chief strategists for Hillary's campaign, after the word came that she lost.
[01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:11.027]  She threw such a fit, we first broke that the day after.
[01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:15.409]  That she was drunk, throwing things, attacking Podesta.
[01:25:15.409 --> 01:25:17.230]  This was all confirmed, like, a year later.
[01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:18.872]  We broke this here.
[01:25:18.872 --> 01:25:21.614]  The day of the election, that she threw a fit.
[01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:23.135]  That's why they're so mad, folks.
[01:25:23.135 --> 01:25:24.736]  We've got the sources.
[01:25:24.736 --> 01:25:25.117]  They don't.
[01:25:25.117 --> 01:25:26.538]  They just lie.
[01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:30.661]  And that she wouldn't even concede, basically, and then they had to basically sedate her.
[01:25:30.661 --> 01:25:33.103]  And remember she wasn't seen for weeks?
[01:25:33.103 --> 01:25:34.665]  Only popped up for a few seconds a few days later?
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.921]  Totally whacked out of her mind.
[01:25:36.921 --> 01:25:37.942]  And here's Ben Rhodes.
[01:25:37.942 --> 01:25:41.024]  This just got released from the night of the election.
[01:25:41.024 --> 01:25:42.985]  2.30 in the morning when they know it's all over.
[01:25:42.985 --> 01:25:46.828]  HBO footage of Ben Rhodes on election night is as bad as people said it was.
[01:25:46.828 --> 01:25:50.510]  Let's go ahead and roll it with the space alien Megyn Kelly.
[01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:52.052]  She looks like a bleached out grey alien.
[01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:54.493]  Here it is.
[01:25:54.493 --> 01:26:00.337]  I just came outside to try to process all this.
[01:26:00.337 --> 01:26:05.161]  It's a lot to process.
[01:26:06.656 --> 01:26:15.982]  I mean, uh... It already printed.
[01:26:15.982 --> 01:26:26.570]  I can't even... Madam President, uh... Remember Newsweek?
[01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.850]  I can't...
[01:26:31.983 --> 01:26:34.324]  That's all these people do is put on this nice guy act.
[01:26:34.324 --> 01:26:39.647]  These are the nastiest people that are on the WikiLeaks scheming.
[01:26:39.647 --> 01:26:44.450]  I can't... I can't put it into words.
[01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.932]  I don't know what the words are.
[01:26:47.932 --> 01:26:59.779]  Well, the words are you tried to run a demonic female version of the Crypt Keeper with a laundry list of bloodthirsty activity and betrayal and pedophile protection that the world's ever seen.
[01:27:01.328 --> 01:27:14.857]  And you're all in the WikiLeaks, thousands of pages they want to divert us from, bragging about race war, bragging about division, bragging about the Democratic Party going to own women and all their money.
[01:27:14.857 --> 01:27:18.240]  And so then you don't get all the things you thought you got.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.123]  You didn't get to pee pee all over America to feel like a big boy.
[01:27:23.123 --> 01:27:25.265]  He wanted to look like a dog rubbing its butt on the carpet.
[01:27:25.265 --> 01:27:27.126]  He just wanted to kind of scoot around America forever.
[01:27:27.126 --> 01:27:29.788]  And it's just, again, they thought they had us intimidated.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.061]  They don't understand we were asleep.
[01:27:33.061 --> 01:27:38.567]  So now they're doubling down the intimidation, the threats, the lawsuits, the attacks, and they go, you're supposed to go away!
[01:27:38.567 --> 01:27:43.932]  You're supposed to just fold up!
[01:27:43.932 --> 01:27:46.275]  I'm not going away.
[01:27:46.275 --> 01:27:47.056]  Ever.
[01:27:47.056 --> 01:27:52.881]  I don't care what you do, what you pull, I'm breathing air, I'm above ground, I'm attacking you.
[01:27:53.942 --> 01:27:55.803]  And I'm promoting freedom.
[01:27:55.803 --> 01:28:05.410]  When we come back, we've got Savannah Hernandez out there at the scene of the abortuary talking to some other ladies, and we'll hear what she has to say on the other side.
[01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.391]  We're just picking up their Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter feeds.
[01:28:07.391 --> 01:28:10.033]  It's better than us using Skype, but then they can't hear us.
[01:28:10.033 --> 01:28:11.014]  We're kind of staring into that.
[01:28:11.014 --> 01:28:13.215]  We have it posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:13.215 --> 01:28:17.999]  If you want to see the InfoWars slash NRA demonstration, People's NRA,
[01:28:18.699 --> 01:28:18.979]  I don't
[01:28:32.287 --> 01:28:33.848]  Not the other way around.
[01:28:33.848 --> 01:28:34.788]  It's not the scalpels.
[01:28:34.788 --> 01:28:39.611]  It's not scalpel control or vacuum cleaner control or acid control.
[01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:43.693]  You know, they pump acid in, the baby flops around for about 30 minutes, then they chop it up.
[01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.354]  So we're going to be looking at all of that.
[01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:50.936]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.

[01:33:35.475 --> 01:33:37.496]  We have broken their back!
[01:33:37.496 --> 01:33:38.436]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:33:38.436 --> 01:33:41.297]  Let's go!
[01:33:41.297 --> 01:33:43.397]  Come on!
[01:33:43.397 --> 01:33:45.038]  Come on!
[01:33:45.038 --> 01:33:45.658]  Come on!
[01:33:45.658 --> 01:33:46.298]  Come on!
[01:33:46.298 --> 01:33:46.938]  Come on!
[01:33:46.938 --> 01:33:48.179]  Come on!
[01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:48.839]  Come on!
[01:33:48.839 --> 01:33:49.459]  Come on!
[01:33:49.459 --> 01:33:50.559]  Come on!
[01:33:56.370 --> 01:34:02.772]  So, you've been on YouTube for years and you don't know who I am.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:30.962]  I'm primitive, I'm real, I know the enemy, and if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[01:34:30.962 --> 01:34:34.702]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.023]  You'll never defeat God!
[01:34:37.023 --> 01:34:38.323]  You'll never win!
[01:34:38.323 --> 01:34:42.264]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[01:34:42.264 --> 01:34:49.446]  You guys know who he is?
[01:34:49.446 --> 01:34:50.766]  You know Alex Jones has ample awards?
[01:34:52.773 --> 01:35:19.957]  Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones 
Alex Jones
[01:35:28.507 --> 01:35:29.548]  Repent now!
[01:35:29.548 --> 01:35:30.409]  Repent now!
[01:35:30.409 --> 01:35:32.731]  I know your mustache is cool!
[01:35:32.731 --> 01:35:34.872]  You got little girlfriend glasses!
[01:35:34.872 --> 01:35:36.934]  You scare me so bad!
[01:35:36.934 --> 01:35:42.559]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:35:42.559 --> 01:35:45.441]  And I wanted to share this momentous occasion
[01:35:55.049 --> 01:36:05.063]  With Roger Stone, again, former top advisor to Trump of 40 years, patriot, former head of the campaign that has turned the whole world around.
[01:36:05.063 --> 01:36:09.789]  We just had the North Korean delegation go into the White House 15 minutes ago.
[01:36:09.789 --> 01:36:11.131]  They're meeting with the president.
[01:36:11.914 --> 01:36:16.135]  The globalist left is beside themselves trying to sabotage it.
[01:36:16.135 --> 01:36:20.596]  The out-of-control neocons, Bolton, are trying to sabotage it.
[01:36:20.596 --> 01:36:21.836]  It's incredible.
[01:36:21.836 --> 01:36:25.577]  Unemployment, 3.8, the lowest ever recorded in modern history.
[01:36:25.577 --> 01:36:31.379]  The word from inside the Kudlow meeting, soon, 4% growth rate will be announced.
[01:36:31.379 --> 01:36:32.999]  And now, the reason Roger's here with us.
[01:36:34.946 --> 01:36:41.671]  Comey grilled as feds seriously consider charging McCabe in criminal referral.
[01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:45.534]  That's out of the Washington Post and that's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:49.457]  Oh yes, the word is going back to around Christmas or after Trump said that's it.
[01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:53.720]  They're not suing for peace, no quarter given, no taken.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.783]  We're going on ramming speed and Roger's got his ear to the ground on this.
[01:36:57.783 --> 01:37:02.526]  You saw the Dinesh D'Souza, pardon, genius.
[01:37:02.526 --> 01:37:05.728]  It's not a convicted coke dealer or weapons trafficker.
[01:37:05.728 --> 01:37:07.270]  That's why the media is upset.
[01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:08.290]  So much to cover.
[01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:09.972]  Trey Gowdy is now being outed as
[01:37:10.652 --> 01:37:15.296]  Basically working for the Deep State to shield the FBI and Justice Department.
[01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:21.861]  So it's all happening and it's such a big deal to see this unfolding.
[01:37:21.861 --> 01:37:28.186]  It's a real celebration because I think you can mark the last few weeks as the breaking of the Deep State's back.
[01:37:28.186 --> 01:37:29.247]  That doesn't mean they're not going to
[01:37:29.827 --> 01:37:34.248]  Savagely trying to tear the heads off of the low-hanging fruit because they can't get at POTUS.
[01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:36.068]  He's broken through their mind control.
[01:37:36.068 --> 01:37:38.369]  He's broken through all their demonization and control.
[01:37:38.369 --> 01:37:41.909]  He's broken through them trying to attack anybody that supports him.
[01:37:41.909 --> 01:37:49.271]  And in their rage, anybody like Stone or myself have been chosen for destruction.
[01:37:49.271 --> 01:37:51.931]  So I'm just saying, I want to keep going in the fight.
[01:37:51.931 --> 01:37:54.732]  We are beginning to win, but the battle is raging.
[01:37:54.732 --> 01:37:56.112]  2018 is everything.
[01:37:56.112 --> 01:37:56.832]  Now, unprecedented.
[01:37:56.852 --> 01:37:59.433]  President Trump aims to defy midterm campaign history.
[01:37:59.433 --> 01:38:01.773]  The Democrats are panicking even in their fake polls.
[01:38:01.773 --> 01:38:09.575]  The Republicans are neck and neck or ahead, which means they're 10 points ahead, which means only massive election fraud can stop us now.
[01:38:09.575 --> 01:38:11.055]  We're removing the neocons.
[01:38:11.055 --> 01:38:12.815]  We're removing the leftist scum.
[01:38:12.815 --> 01:38:14.076]  We are turbocharging.
[01:38:14.076 --> 01:38:16.536]  It will not be the communist Chinese century.
[01:38:16.536 --> 01:38:21.317]  It will be the new American century and not the one Dick Cheney talked about.
[01:38:21.317 --> 01:38:23.037]  This is winning.
[01:38:23.037 --> 01:38:24.158]  Stone, I can feel it.
[01:38:24.158 --> 01:38:25.098]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:28.274]  Well, Alex, I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:38:28.274 --> 01:38:35.570]  You know, it takes an ocean liner a substantial amount of time to turn, but the president is now finally on offense.
[01:38:36.584 --> 01:38:50.532]  And I think a majority of Americans now realize that Mueller is the criminal, Comey is the criminal, Brennan is a criminal, McCabe is a criminal, and these people must be brought to justice.
[01:38:50.532 --> 01:39:01.659]  That the Washington Post prints an op-ed from the psychopath, criminal John Brennan, a traitor, and the man who I believe is the perpetrator of the phony dossier,
[01:39:02.239 --> 01:39:05.660]  Who lied about it under oath in front of the Congress.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:09.761]  The folks at the Washington Post should really be ashamed of themselves.
[01:39:09.761 --> 01:39:11.101]  But you're right.
[01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:15.122]  The forces of freedom are on the move.
[01:39:15.122 --> 01:39:20.383]  Rudy Giuliani is exactly the wartime conciliary the President needed.
[01:39:20.383 --> 01:39:28.345]  And I believe when the Inspector General's report is finally rendered, Jeff Sessions is going to get his walking papers.
[01:39:28.345 --> 01:39:31.406]  The single worst Attorney General in U.S.
[01:39:31.406 --> 01:39:31.766]  history.
[01:39:31.926 --> 01:39:33.348]  And they've signaled the whole deal.
[01:39:33.348 --> 01:39:35.350]  Giuliani goes, oh, we're not getting rid of him yet.
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:37.353]  The AG report comes out, we'll see.
[01:39:37.353 --> 01:39:41.818]  And then, torpedoes away, they're all gone, and lavish indictments.
[01:39:41.818 --> 01:39:49.228]  But, as the Wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating yet, how could the enemy grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:39:50.182 --> 01:39:51.943]  Well, they're trying even as we speak.
[01:39:51.943 --> 01:40:14.015]  This morning, I believe that as many of two of my former associates were in front of a grand jury in Washington, D.C., where they are being pressured into bearing false witness against me as the special prosecutor comes up with no evidence of Russian collusion, no evidence of trafficking in allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks.
[01:40:14.435 --> 01:40:20.657]  No evidence of advanced knowledge of John Podesta's emails being published.
[01:40:20.657 --> 01:40:29.880]  So now they seek to concoct some other phony offense in an attempt to squeeze me into testifying against the President.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.181]  In other words, they want me to be a rat.
[01:40:32.181 --> 01:40:36.743]  They want me to perjure myself to help bring down the President.
[01:40:36.743 --> 01:40:38.984]  That is not going to happen.
[01:40:38.984 --> 01:40:40.024]  Zero chance.
[01:40:40.524 --> 01:40:46.968]  And I would remind anyone who's headed to the grand jury, perjury before the grand jury is a crime.
[01:40:46.968 --> 01:40:48.288]  Tell the truth.
[01:40:48.288 --> 01:40:52.011]  I urge everyone to simply tell the truth.
[01:40:52.011 --> 01:40:59.555]  You were all over the news last night and this morning knowing it's dangerous that the president, old 45, old reliable,
[01:41:01.471 --> 01:41:02.071]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:03.992]  No one deserves a pardon more than that great patriot, General Mike Flynn.
[01:41:27.839 --> 01:41:29.821]  His entire indictment is a fraud.
[01:41:29.821 --> 01:41:33.926]  The FBI themselves conceded that he hadn't lied.
[01:41:33.926 --> 01:41:36.950]  This is a vendetta left over from the Obama administration.
[01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:45.746]  I believe Mike Flynn is not only a great patriot, but a man whose greatest public service to this country lies ahead of him, not behind him.
[01:41:45.746 --> 01:41:53.588]  If there is one person who deserves a pardon more than any other, and by the way, the President can issue a pardon at any time.
[01:41:53.588 --> 01:42:03.769]  Prior to conviction, prior to indictment, after conviction, after a guilty plea, at any time, the President can issue a pardon.
[01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:06.990]  We learned that in the Ford pardon of Richard Nixon.
[01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:12.633]  Do you remember about a year ago, I said, next time you talk to 45, I said, you ought to bring up D'Souza?
[01:42:12.633 --> 01:42:19.398]  And I'm not saying we did that, I know we did, and we're credited with the Sheriff O'Pio, because he didn't even know that that had happened with that judge.
[01:42:19.398 --> 01:42:21.559]  The judge was self-convicting him.
[01:42:21.559 --> 01:42:24.461]  I'm just going from memory, but didn't you bring it up to the President about D'Souza?
[01:42:25.556 --> 01:42:28.879]  I have suggested that, although it was some time ago.
[01:42:28.879 --> 01:42:33.982]  So either he retained it or perhaps someone more recently recommended it to him.
[01:42:33.982 --> 01:42:38.905]  But this is an extraordinary miscarriage of justice.
[01:42:38.905 --> 01:42:44.169]  Dinesh D'Souza made a made a violated a federal campaign finance law.
[01:42:45.241 --> 01:42:48.905]  Roseanne Barr has, pardon me, that's incorrect.
[01:42:48.905 --> 01:42:50.066]  Roseanne O'Donnell.
[01:42:50.066 --> 01:42:53.790]  O'Donnell has violated the exact same law.
[01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:54.570]  By millions.
[01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:55.151]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:55.812]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.301 --> 01:43:04.945]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:43:04.945 --> 01:43:12.849]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:43:12.849 --> 01:43:15.931]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:21.216]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:43:21.216 --> 01:43:25.361]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:43:25.361 --> 01:43:28.504]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:43:28.504 --> 01:43:33.269]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:43:33.269 --> 01:43:36.333]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:43:36.713 --> 01:43:51.799]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:43:51.799 --> 01:43:53.319]  That is critical to this fight.

[01:44:58.533 --> 01:45:02.498]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.498 --> 01:45:05.782]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.782 --> 01:45:12.051]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.051 --> 01:45:14.834]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.555 --> 01:45:19.377]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.377 --> 01:45:25.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.803]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.573 --> 01:45:35.476]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.476 --> 01:45:42.681]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.681 --> 01:45:47.404]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.404 --> 01:45:53.609]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.609 --> 01:45:57.572]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.564 --> 01:46:05.491]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[01:46:05.491 --> 01:46:14.279]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:29.247]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.

[01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.034]  Who is that man?
[01:47:41.034 --> 01:47:41.654]  Is that Elvis?
[01:47:58.928 --> 01:48:05.072]  All right, back to Roger Stone, and then coming up... Big Magazine's host of the fourth hour.
[01:48:05.072 --> 01:48:09.134]  We're trying to get Katie Hopkins on.
[01:48:09.134 --> 01:48:11.695]  She'll be on next week from Russia.
[01:48:11.695 --> 01:48:17.739]  Mike Rotondo, the 30-year-old who got evicted out of his parents' house.
[01:48:17.739 --> 01:48:19.260]  I love taking control of the news cycle.
[01:48:20.208 --> 01:48:22.229]  Some of the listeners are like, why would you give that bum $3,000?
[01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:24.510]  Someone to see what he was like.
[01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:33.575]  And I wanted to point out that the welfare stuff he was doing off his parents was nothing compared to people getting sex changes paid for by taxpayers or abortions or all the anchor babies.
[01:48:33.575 --> 01:48:40.098]  And then now he's moved out of his house and I got hundreds of news article headlines talking about how
[01:48:41.445 --> 01:48:46.890]  The left pays for sex changes with our tax money and for anchor babies, so don't say this guy's the biggest enemy in the world.
[01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:50.873]  So I took that, and God, let's not exaggerate, because mainstream media is worthless.
[01:48:50.873 --> 01:48:56.177]  They would charge millions of dollars, millions and millions, to be on the front page of USA Today.
[01:48:56.177 --> 01:48:57.578]  Worthless crap.
[01:48:57.578 --> 01:48:58.980]  Hundreds of thousands for a full-page ad.
[01:48:59.838 --> 01:49:16.432]  I just do that stunt, and I'm in hundreds and hundreds of publications, Good Morning America everywhere, pointing out that they are funding Anchor Babies, they have everything free, and all this other crap, and then I've got conservatives going, Jones is an idiot, funding that deadbeat.
[01:49:18.055 --> 01:49:19.816]  Okay, I got millions of dollars advertising for $3,000?
[01:49:19.816 --> 01:49:22.897]  Yeah, I'm real stupid.
[01:49:22.897 --> 01:49:23.958]  I'm real dumb.
[01:49:23.958 --> 01:49:26.459]  Why doesn't everybody else show me how it's all done?
[01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:29.801]  When I told you Trump was gonna win, I told you 5G'd give you cancer.
[01:49:29.801 --> 01:49:30.841]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[01:49:30.841 --> 01:49:33.002]  It's all right here anyways.
[01:49:33.002 --> 01:49:34.503]  We're telling the truth.
[01:49:34.503 --> 01:49:35.824]  The globalists know the truth.
[01:49:35.824 --> 01:49:37.064]  They use it against you.
[01:49:37.064 --> 01:49:38.625]  We're showing you the hat trick.
[01:49:38.625 --> 01:49:43.087]  We're showing you how there's a table, and you think he's getting a rabbit out of the empty hat.
[01:49:43.087 --> 01:49:46.369]  There's a door opening in the table, and there's a rabbit under there.
[01:49:47.042 --> 01:49:50.926]  And there's a hot blonde assistant under there too, doing my toenails.
[01:49:50.926 --> 01:49:57.351]  And the point is, is that he's reaching down into it, and he's getting a rabbit out of that, then the trap closes and he pulls it out.
[01:49:57.351 --> 01:50:00.955]  It's that simple.
[01:50:00.955 --> 01:50:02.416]  We had rain coming into the car.
[01:50:02.416 --> 01:50:05.439]  Trump's closing the sunroof.
[01:50:05.439 --> 01:50:06.460]  He's untying the boat.
[01:50:07.998 --> 01:50:11.781]  Now, Roger is going to not be here next week, but the week after.
[01:50:11.781 --> 01:50:15.724]  That's when we're gonna do a Friday 24-hour broadcast, or a long broadcast.
[01:50:15.724 --> 01:50:20.528]  Then we're gonna come back on Saturday and go to midnight, and then come back Sunday.
[01:50:20.528 --> 01:50:26.692]  So it's gonna be three days of expanded transmissions to just chronicle the incredible history and time we're in.
[01:50:26.692 --> 01:50:28.074]  But here's the thing.
[01:50:28.074 --> 01:50:31.516]  People ask why I'm such a maniac sometimes.
[01:50:31.516 --> 01:50:34.839]  When you unlock areas in you where you decide to not be afraid,
[01:50:36.527 --> 01:50:49.358]  And when you decide to take action and you have victory, but then the enemy turns up the heat, your brain begins to flip the switches for you to be very aggressive, very smart, very decisive, very on target.
[01:50:49.358 --> 01:50:54.343]  And for all these other men that act like they're strong or just want money, women are looking for that.
[01:50:54.343 --> 01:50:56.465]  People are looking for daredeviling.
[01:50:56.465 --> 01:50:57.746]  They're looking for trailblazing.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.342]  They're looking for real strength.
[01:51:01.342 --> 01:51:03.624]  And I'm not saying I'm the biggest, baddest guy around the world.
[01:51:03.624 --> 01:51:09.948]  I'm just saying when it comes to blowing holes in enemy operations, really trying to promote freedom, you know, Trump's up there.
[01:51:09.948 --> 01:51:10.909]  Infowars is down here.
[01:51:10.909 --> 01:51:13.651]  You got Roger Stone, Drudge, all these other great trailblazers.
[01:51:13.651 --> 01:51:17.354]  We're in this special college together.
[01:51:17.354 --> 01:51:19.015]  We're in this brotherhood, this sisterhood.
[01:51:19.015 --> 01:51:21.297]  But I'll tell the listeners, don't thank me.
[01:51:21.297 --> 01:51:24.259]  You are the blood of this operation.
[01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:27.872]  Without you, there's nothing.
[01:51:27.872 --> 01:51:35.199]  So when I say I salute you, when I say I thank you, I run into these families that are just in awe when they meet me.
[01:51:35.199 --> 01:51:36.740]  It's like, you're in awe of me?
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.081]  I'm just a red-blooded American like you.
[01:51:38.081 --> 01:51:39.122]  You love what we're doing.
[01:51:39.122 --> 01:51:39.783]  You're supporting us.
[01:51:39.783 --> 01:51:41.204]  You get your family attacking you.
[01:51:41.204 --> 01:51:43.186]  You get fired for saying you love America.
[01:51:43.186 --> 01:51:44.607]  You get fired for being pro-gun.
[01:51:44.607 --> 01:51:46.649]  You get harassed.
[01:51:46.649 --> 01:51:48.651]  I know real liberals at UT.
[01:51:48.651 --> 01:51:49.492]  One guy I know has been a big
[01:51:51.028 --> 01:51:53.131]  A film editor and also produced pretty big movies.
[01:51:53.131 --> 01:51:54.293]  He said he didn't like Hollywood anymore.
[01:51:54.293 --> 01:51:57.176]  Even though he was making a million bucks a year, he came back.
[01:51:57.176 --> 01:51:58.839]  He's going to be a psychologist.
[01:51:58.839 --> 01:52:00.421]  His dad's a famous medical doctor.
[01:52:00.421 --> 01:52:04.126]  One of the top kidney doctors in the world.
[01:52:04.126 --> 01:52:06.068]  And I've known him since college.
[01:52:06.068 --> 01:52:07.570]  And he's Jewish.
[01:52:08.592 --> 01:52:09.593]  And I'm not going to say his name.
[01:52:09.593 --> 01:52:11.694]  He's a good friend of mine since college.
[01:52:11.694 --> 01:52:12.854]  And he's really classy.
[01:52:12.854 --> 01:52:13.775]  He's a classical liberal.
[01:52:13.775 --> 01:52:14.815]  He just loves everybody.
[01:52:14.815 --> 01:52:16.296]  He's nice and smart.
[01:52:16.296 --> 01:52:20.358]  They kicked him out of the psychology department and said, no whites allowed.
[01:52:20.358 --> 01:52:24.181]  And they're on record saying, and we don't want Jews in here either.
[01:52:24.181 --> 01:52:25.901]  That's UT.
[01:52:25.901 --> 01:52:30.044]  The political correctness has gone to cuckoo land, folks.
[01:52:30.044 --> 01:52:31.585]  It's crazy.
[01:52:31.585 --> 01:52:33.646]  And the globalists and the communist Chinese funding it.
[01:52:34.542 --> 01:52:35.243]  Have a plan.
[01:52:35.243 --> 01:52:36.864]  UT is run by the Chinese Communist.
[01:52:36.864 --> 01:52:37.964]  That's in the news now.
[01:52:37.964 --> 01:52:39.165]  So I'm going back to Roger Stone in this segment.
[01:52:39.165 --> 01:52:44.389]  The point is, is that the left has gone completely insane.
[01:52:44.389 --> 01:52:50.473]  Everybody's going to get persecuted unless we stand up to this and say no.
[01:52:50.473 --> 01:52:52.195]  And it's now time.
[01:52:52.195 --> 01:52:52.975]  You better do it.
[01:52:52.975 --> 01:52:54.416]  You better decide which side you're on.
[01:52:54.416 --> 01:52:56.237]  Plus, we're turning the tide.
[01:52:56.237 --> 01:52:59.300]  Now, people like me and Roger might get drilled in the ground, but it doesn't matter.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:00.040]  We are still fighting.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.302]  But if you pray for us, if you financially support us,
[01:53:03.928 --> 01:53:07.149]  We will absolutely rip holes in them because they're attacking us.
[01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:08.070]  We're in the spotlight.
[01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:12.991]  So every dollar you support us with is like a million dollars in regular political warfare.
[01:53:12.991 --> 01:53:19.374]  I mean, you cannot deliver munitions to the front where soldiers are killing more of the enemy politically.
[01:53:19.374 --> 01:53:21.095]  I mean, you give us weapons.
[01:53:21.095 --> 01:53:22.655]  We are the kamikaze pilots.
[01:53:22.655 --> 01:53:23.956]  We are the daredevils.
[01:53:23.956 --> 01:53:25.776]  We are flying the Death Star Trench.
[01:53:25.776 --> 01:53:27.177]  We've already blown up Death Stars.
[01:53:28.732 --> 01:53:31.713]  We've already blown up- on the side of our helmets is Death Stars.
[01:53:31.713 --> 01:53:32.933]  You understand that?
[01:53:32.933 --> 01:53:33.994]  That's why they hate us.
[01:53:33.994 --> 01:53:35.494]  We've already aced their head.
[01:53:35.494 --> 01:53:39.795]  We've already blown them- the enemy snipers have pictures of us on their sleeves.
[01:53:39.795 --> 01:53:40.636]  They're looking for us.
[01:53:40.636 --> 01:53:41.136]  Where are they?
[01:53:41.136 --> 01:53:41.816]  Get them, get them!
[01:53:41.816 --> 01:53:44.937]  There's bounties out.
[01:53:44.937 --> 01:53:48.918]  There's a $15 million political bounty from Soros out on me.
[01:53:48.918 --> 01:53:51.479]  He's already spent $15 million, I've confirmed.
[01:53:51.479 --> 01:53:52.719]  Yeah!
[01:53:52.719 --> 01:53:54.200]  I know, I'm proud to be in this position.

[01:54:16.047 --> 01:54:20.128]  If you're not investing in information warfare using the truth, you're crazy!
[01:54:20.968 --> 01:54:30.341]  Roger, I'm ranting, only four minutes left of this segment, but StoneColdTruth.com, you have your legal defense, people should support it, they should buy your book, and InfoWareStore.com, Stone's Rules.
[01:54:30.341 --> 01:54:32.263]  They should understand that, you know, we are the champions.
[01:54:32.263 --> 01:54:36.870]  None of us are perfect, but we've been chosen now as figureheads of the left for us to be destroyed.
[01:54:38.157 --> 01:54:39.457]  No, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:54:39.457 --> 01:54:45.819]  The two most important things I think people can do, go to stonedefensefund.com, make a contribution.
[01:54:45.819 --> 01:54:49.701]  Go to the donate button at the InfoWars store, make a contribution.
[01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:50.921]  $100, $200, $500, $10, it doesn't matter.
[01:54:50.921 --> 01:54:52.221]  But we need your support.
[01:54:52.221 --> 01:54:54.222]  I got a bill from my attorney this morning for $40,000.
[01:55:01.324 --> 01:55:09.749]  Just for the motion to dismiss the harassment lawsuit filed against me by that Obama front organization in Washington, D.C.
[01:55:09.749 --> 01:55:16.974]  The whole purpose here, Alex, is to bankrupt you, bankrupt InfoWars, bankrupt me, bankrupt the Stone family.
[01:55:16.974 --> 01:55:23.938]  So, StoneDefenseFund.com, InfoWarsStore.com, where the donate button can easily be found.
[01:55:23.938 --> 01:55:26.339]  You are the lifeblood of this revolution.
[01:55:26.339 --> 01:55:28.861]  We cannot soldier on without your support.
[01:55:30.643 --> 01:55:33.306]  This is not a spectator sport.
[01:55:33.306 --> 01:55:34.408]  This is total participation.
[01:55:34.408 --> 01:55:35.409]  I'm not bitching at the audience.
[01:55:35.409 --> 01:55:36.170]  They've been great.
[01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:37.612]  They've supported us, the affiliates, everybody.
[01:55:37.612 --> 01:55:38.573]  But this is it.
[01:55:38.573 --> 01:55:39.414]  This is history.
[01:55:39.414 --> 01:55:40.035]  This is happening.
[01:55:40.035 --> 01:55:40.275]  Roger.
[01:55:41.155 --> 01:55:44.976]  From your sources, I have separate sources that said no, Trump's pissed, the gloves are off.
[01:55:44.976 --> 01:55:51.677]  I've talked to a lot of other sources, they say that Trump is, these are criminals, everybody knows it's criminals, you better indict their asses.
[01:55:51.677 --> 01:55:53.198]  And the word is, they're closing in.
[01:55:53.198 --> 01:55:59.759]  So, on this particular Death Star, this is the big one, how far until we get up to the exhaust port just below the main port?
[01:55:59.759 --> 01:56:03.540]  How long do we fire those photon torpedoes right down the shaft?
[01:56:04.974 --> 01:56:06.836]  Well, I think there are two things to watch for.
[01:56:06.836 --> 01:56:09.859]  One is the coming Inspector General's report.
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:18.047]  I think that that's going to decapitate a number of people in the forefront of the deep state takedown of Donald Trump.
[01:56:18.047 --> 01:56:24.693]  Secondarily, keep an eye on the decision by Judge Ellis of Virginia regarding the Manafort indictment.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:42.683]  And also keep an eye on this recent legal opinion by Professor Stephen Calabresi that Mark Levin and Sean Hannity have talked so extensively about that questions the entire unconstitutionality of Mr. Mully's very appointment.
[01:56:42.683 --> 01:56:46.704]  Therefore, any action on his part would be unconstitutional.
[01:56:46.704 --> 01:56:48.924]  Those are the three things to watch carefully.
[01:56:48.924 --> 01:56:51.885]  Armageddon is just around the corner.
[01:56:53.118 --> 01:56:57.943]  Armageddon for the deep state, because this is not your regular president in the swamp going along with corruption.
[01:56:57.943 --> 01:57:00.366]  He plans to pull the rotten teeth very soon, doesn't he?
[01:57:01.476 --> 01:57:02.516]  It sure looks that way.
[01:57:02.516 --> 01:57:06.117]  I think his patience are really worn thin.
[01:57:06.117 --> 01:57:09.398]  He's tired of being a punching bag for the mainstream media.
[01:57:09.398 --> 01:57:11.498]  He's tired of the abuses.
[01:57:11.498 --> 01:57:14.359]  The real squeeze is on Donald Trump Jr.
[01:57:14.359 --> 01:57:15.099]  right now.
[01:57:15.099 --> 01:57:17.020]  Never mind Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:20.440]  Yeah, we're under the microscope and that pressure's coming.
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:27.302]  But they're really trying to squeeze Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot in my opinion, and that is the line.
[01:57:27.942 --> 01:57:32.968]  That if crossed, will mean nuclear war against Mr. Mueller.
[01:57:32.968 --> 01:57:33.809]  But he can't help it.
[01:57:33.809 --> 01:57:39.436]  Mueller's so used to having America down with his boot on our neck, he just thinks he can't be defeated.
[01:57:39.436 --> 01:57:43.961]  That old rotten brain up there has no idea what he's about to go under.
[01:57:43.961 --> 01:57:46.384]  We will defeat you, you globalist trash.

[01:58:54.626 --> 01:58:57.828]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:57.828 --> 01:59:01.550]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:06.232]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.232 --> 01:59:09.514]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.394 --> 01:59:21.403]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.403 --> 01:59:29.930]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:59:31.559 --> 01:59:40.601]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:59:44.903 --> 01:59:46.183]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.743 --> 02:00:09.026]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[02:00:09.026 --> 02:00:15.251]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:16.912]  I love how they try to spin it.
[02:00:16.912 --> 02:00:21.756]  Oh, Republicans have all three branches of government.
[02:00:21.756 --> 02:00:23.738]  Only because there's enough of them following their oaths.
[02:00:25.034 --> 02:00:26.795]  We don't have Hollywood.
[02:00:26.795 --> 02:00:28.515]  We don't have the Chi-Coms.
[02:00:28.515 --> 02:00:29.916]  We don't have the big banks.
[02:00:29.916 --> 02:00:31.236]  We don't have the big corporations.
[02:00:31.236 --> 02:00:32.817]  We don't have Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:00:32.817 --> 02:00:34.097]  We don't have all the universities.
[02:00:34.097 --> 02:00:39.199]  We don't have that mass trying to bring down the country.
[02:00:39.199 --> 02:00:47.261]  We, in a last-ditch effort, have part of Congress, part of the courts, and the executive.
[02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:49.362]  Trump doesn't have real trifecta yet.
[02:00:49.362 --> 02:00:52.103]  He gets a hold and even gains seats
[02:00:53.410 --> 02:00:57.673]  Coming up in the midterms that are only, my God, only a few months away.
[02:00:57.673 --> 02:01:00.696]  This is such an incredible time to be alive.
[02:01:00.696 --> 02:01:06.961]  If we can hold on, we have really, for this phase of the war, won.
[02:01:06.961 --> 02:01:11.244]  Doesn't mean we can rest, but I mean, this is just, this is nail biting.
[02:01:11.244 --> 02:01:13.106]  Roger, get back into Donald Trump Jr.
[02:01:13.106 --> 02:01:14.267]  They are honing in on him.
[02:01:14.267 --> 02:01:20.212]  I mean, I would say you're, they've said you're the main target right now, but I agree they're, they're, they're, they're,
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.841]  Well, why do you say he's the main target?
[02:01:22.841 --> 02:01:24.941]  I know they've really been going after him.
[02:01:24.941 --> 02:01:29.043]  Their arrogance is just unbridled.
[02:01:29.043 --> 02:01:31.044]  They're so foolish.
[02:01:31.044 --> 02:01:35.846]  Sources tell me that that is their real primary focus, Donald Trump Jr.
[02:01:35.846 --> 02:01:42.648]  I want to address something you just said, Alex, which is things in Washington cannot be viewed in terms of Republican-Democrat.
[02:01:42.648 --> 02:01:44.229]  That's outmoded thinking.
[02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:46.710]  This is patriots versus globalists.
[02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:48.811]  This is outsiders versus insiders.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.162]  The Deep State Conspiracy is a bipartisan criminal conspiracy.
[02:01:54.162 --> 02:01:56.162]  Party label means nothing.
[02:01:56.162 --> 02:01:58.783]  People say to me, Robert Mueller is a registered Republican.
[02:01:58.783 --> 02:01:59.764]  So what?
[02:01:59.764 --> 02:02:02.184]  He's committed crimes on behalf of the Clintons.
[02:02:02.184 --> 02:02:05.786]  His party registration is unimportant.
[02:02:05.786 --> 02:02:07.546]  Party labels mean nothing.
[02:02:07.546 --> 02:02:08.927]  Paul Ryan.
[02:02:08.927 --> 02:02:10.087]  Mitch McConnell.
[02:02:10.087 --> 02:02:12.408]  These guys are in bed with the Deep State.
[02:02:12.961 --> 02:02:15.784]  Their party registration is immaterial.
[02:02:15.784 --> 02:02:18.526]  What we need is not a Republican majority.
[02:02:18.526 --> 02:02:21.690]  What we need is an American majority.
[02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:23.932]  And we're headed in that direction.
[02:02:23.932 --> 02:02:26.955]  So don't view things in terms of the parties.
[02:02:26.955 --> 02:02:33.901]  No, right now, even though all three branches of government are technically Republican, you have Republicans like
[02:02:35.083 --> 02:02:39.786]  Lindsey Graham suggesting that Robert Mueller cannot be fired.
[02:02:39.786 --> 02:02:44.748]  Lindsey, I know you can't read very well, but he's entirely fireable.
[02:02:44.748 --> 02:02:47.630]  He serves at the pleasure of the executive.
[02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:54.133]  And the idea that any one person is above the law is a repugnant... Well, they're even trying to imply Trump can't do pardons now.
[02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:56.514]  It's just pure BS.
[02:02:56.514 --> 02:03:02.337]  No, but it's perfectly alright for Barack Obama to pardon drug dealers and other psychopaths.
[02:03:02.337 --> 02:03:03.258]  And communist bombers.
[02:03:04.427 --> 02:03:05.207]  Precisely.
[02:03:05.207 --> 02:03:23.916]  But when Donald Trump uses the pardon power to pardon, say, Jack Johnson, the black boxer, something that Barack Obama has done, I've urged the President to give a posthumous pardon for Marcus Garvey, who I think was harassed by the federal government.
[02:03:23.916 --> 02:03:26.037]  There would be an act of justice.
[02:03:26.037 --> 02:03:26.557]  Absolutely.
[02:03:26.557 --> 02:03:27.637]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:03:29.318 --> 02:03:32.220]  It's beyond just the fact that Trump can do this.
[02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:37.283]  He's doing it for good people that aren't drug dealers, that aren't arms dealers, that aren't sex traffickers.
[02:03:37.283 --> 02:03:42.486]  And Obama and Clinton all did that and the media didn't even cover it.
[02:03:42.486 --> 02:03:45.228]  I mean, it's just outrageous how criminal these people are.
[02:03:46.089 --> 02:03:54.315]  Well, and they criticized Trump today for not going through the normal pardon process of application being made and going through committees.
[02:03:54.315 --> 02:04:02.920]  Have they forgotten the Mark Rich pardon by Bill Clinton where money was paid to the Clinton Foundation?
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:05.983]  But again, that's the bureaucracy taking control from the President.
[02:04:05.983 --> 02:04:07.283]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:07.283 --> 02:04:11.106]  So it's a perfect example of the double standard.
[02:04:11.106 --> 02:04:15.349]  No, we are in for an epic battle in the days and weeks ahead.
[02:04:16.147 --> 02:04:17.268]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:04:17.268 --> 02:04:25.193]  There comes a point where when I first learned that federal prosecutors were sifting through every molecule of my being, it upset me.
[02:04:25.193 --> 02:04:31.097]  Now all it's done is elevate my ability and my willingness to fight.
[02:04:31.097 --> 02:04:32.818]  I am ready to fight.
[02:04:33.476 --> 02:04:35.898]  This is an abomination.
[02:04:35.898 --> 02:04:39.982]  There is no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks hijinks.
[02:04:39.982 --> 02:04:43.665]  This is nonsense spurred on by the mainstream media.
[02:04:43.665 --> 02:04:45.767]  So let's get it on.
[02:04:45.767 --> 02:04:47.568]  I am so ready.
[02:04:47.568 --> 02:04:50.211]  But I need the support of the Infowar audience.
[02:04:50.211 --> 02:04:50.831]  That's right.
[02:04:50.831 --> 02:04:51.211]  All right.
[02:04:51.211 --> 02:04:51.932]  Great job, Roger.
[02:04:51.932 --> 02:04:55.155]  We're going to come back in an update on the 30-year-old that got evicted from his parents' house.

[02:06:11.477 --> 02:06:12.978]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.978 --> 02:06:18.242]  Well, I tell ya!
[02:06:36.610 --> 02:06:41.152]  It was just a few days ago that we had Mike Rotondo here in studio with us.
[02:06:41.152 --> 02:06:45.153]  He's the 30-year-old that last week got evicted out of his parents' house.
[02:06:45.153 --> 02:06:53.517]  And my point was, let's humanize him, and I still gave him a stiff talking to here about baby bird getting out of the nest.
[02:06:53.517 --> 02:07:00.580]  But I said, listen, we pay, really it's billions a year for taxpayer-paid abortions, taxpayer-paid for sex changes.
[02:07:01.795 --> 02:07:12.842]  All this stuff, and billions and billions for anchor babies, illegal aliens from all over the world come in, or they come in on work visas or travel visas and have their babies here from China, Mexico, you name it.
[02:07:12.842 --> 02:07:16.604]  That's never demonized or attacked as free-loading or lazy or bad.
[02:07:16.604 --> 02:07:20.927]  At least he was doing it with his parents, and that's still bad enough.
[02:07:20.927 --> 02:07:26.490]  I'd rather have my kids with me at 30 than, you know, suicided or something, or Lord knows what, or on the street on drugs.
[02:07:26.490 --> 02:07:27.371]  The point is that
[02:07:28.755 --> 02:07:30.516]  I gave him a stiff talking to.
[02:07:30.516 --> 02:07:35.440]  But I wanted to get those other talking points in on the back of his story.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:47.389]  Because then I could get hundreds of newspapers to quote me saying, he's not a welfare queen compared to these people on a Richter scale, he's a 2 or a 3, whereas the Anchor Babies are a 10.
[02:07:47.389 --> 02:07:48.990]  Or these big corporations.
[02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.810]  Anchor Babies are like a 9.
[02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:57.696]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, paying no tax, having the laws written where they pay no tax basically, and then lecturing middle class people who are not paying enough taxes.
[02:07:59.537 --> 02:08:00.438]  There's like an 11.
[02:08:00.438 --> 02:08:03.880]  So there's the headline of your radio listener, and I'll read it to you from USA Today.
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:09.205]  Hundreds of publications picked it up, and we got that point in over the media.
[02:08:09.205 --> 02:08:11.226]  Can you guys put the USA Today back up for me just real quick?
[02:08:11.226 --> 02:08:12.147]  Thanks.
[02:08:12.147 --> 02:08:16.591]  That 30-year-old man finally moves out of his parents' house thanks to Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.591 --> 02:08:20.694]  Well, thanks to the listeners, thanks to the producers getting him in here.
[02:08:20.694 --> 02:08:25.598]  It was just a great way, one of those little golden moments where I had an idea, I did it,
[02:08:26.767 --> 02:08:29.468]  Grabbed control of it, it blew up.
[02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:38.952]  Kind of like I knew that when Hillary couldn't open the can of pickles, so they already had it open, a can of pickles, a jar of pickles, a glass jar that they pop.
[02:08:38.952 --> 02:08:41.454]  And I knew that everyone would know they popped.
[02:08:41.454 --> 02:08:50.157]  I knew they'd make, I was sitting there at the breakfast table after I worked out with Pat Riley, at my house at like nine in the morning, about to come into the office.
[02:08:50.157 --> 02:08:53.319]  And I'm sitting there, this is a couple years ago, obviously the middle of campaign, two years ago.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:55.262]  And I said, I got an idea.
[02:08:55.262 --> 02:08:59.188]  And I went and got a jar of pickles out of the deal.
[02:08:59.188 --> 02:09:01.051]  There was actually a couple of them.
[02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:01.753]  And I tested one.
[02:09:01.753 --> 02:09:02.594]  I said, see how it pops?
[02:09:02.594 --> 02:09:03.616]  With Hillary, it doesn't pop.
[02:09:03.616 --> 02:09:05.178]  And I said, on air you'd hear it pop.
[02:09:05.178 --> 02:09:06.280]  They're going to think this is stupid.
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:07.002]  They're going to pick it up.
[02:09:07.002 --> 02:09:07.943]  It's going to be all over the news.
[02:09:09.252 --> 02:09:16.118]  And then everyone's going to pop the pickles and know that it was fake for her, that she, you know, and he's like, really?
[02:09:16.118 --> 02:09:16.538]  That'll be big.
[02:09:16.538 --> 02:09:17.739]  And I said, watch.
[02:09:17.739 --> 02:09:22.984]  It's those little golden juices where you just have this idea spontaneously.
[02:09:22.984 --> 02:09:24.145]  It follows through.
[02:09:24.145 --> 02:09:26.046]  You hijack the news cycle.
[02:09:26.767 --> 02:09:29.970]  And we did it again with Mike Rotondo.
[02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:35.335]  So Mike, thanks for helping us get millions of dollars in free advertising here on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:35.335 --> 02:09:39.839]  Now you're learning capitalism, or maybe you already knew it, but you thought it was generous, the $3,000.
[02:09:39.839 --> 02:09:41.120]  I think it was well worth it.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.603]  So thank you for being involved in this, my friend.
[02:09:43.603 --> 02:09:49.408]  Thank you, again, for the $3,000 that's made it so that I can move out without going on the streets.
[02:09:49.408 --> 02:09:51.170]  Who is this Jedi you're with?
[02:09:52.882 --> 02:09:54.242]  I, uh, I'm Tony.
[02:09:54.242 --> 02:10:00.184]  I, uh, I actually went to Mike's house cause he lives around the corner from where I stay.
[02:10:00.184 --> 02:10:02.685]  Uh, cause I was watching InfoWars.
[02:10:02.685 --> 02:10:03.945]  I'm a fan of your show.
[02:10:03.945 --> 02:10:12.868]  I was watching InfoWars and, um, I decided to stop by after work one day and, uh, I stopped by and, uh, he wasn't home, but his mother was there.
[02:10:12.868 --> 02:10:19.690]  When I told her my last name, he, uh, she told me, um, wow, my family has that same exact last name.
[02:10:21.299 --> 02:10:29.082]  And through a conversation, I ended up finding out that me and Mike are cousins, and that I did not even know that until that day.
[02:10:29.082 --> 02:10:30.722]  So she told me to stop.
[02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.523]  You guys do have a family resemblance.
[02:10:32.523 --> 02:10:34.083]  What is the Rotunda name?
[02:10:34.083 --> 02:10:35.043]  What's the lineage of that?
[02:10:35.043 --> 02:10:37.324]  Well, mine's Mastropool.
[02:10:37.324 --> 02:10:41.225]  Would have been Mastodonopalo, but it's Mastropool.
[02:10:41.225 --> 02:10:43.586]  His mother's, I believe, father.
[02:10:47.385 --> 02:10:48.405]  That's my mother's side.
[02:10:48.405 --> 02:10:55.387]  Your mother's, yeah, your mother's father's... My mother's mother's father?
[02:10:55.387 --> 02:10:56.168]  Yes.
[02:10:56.168 --> 02:10:58.869]  Something like that.
[02:10:58.869 --> 02:11:00.909]  I'm a Heinz 57.
[02:11:00.909 --> 02:11:01.949]  Tell me what your backgrounds are.
[02:11:01.949 --> 02:11:03.910]  That's interesting.
[02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:14.613]  I'm Italian, Irish, German, and we have a little bit of, I believe my sister just did ancestry.
[02:11:14.613 --> 02:11:16.754]  So you have a strong, you have a powerful liver.
[02:11:18.086 --> 02:11:18.306]  Huh?
[02:11:18.306 --> 02:11:21.487]  You have a powerful liver.
[02:11:21.487 --> 02:11:25.148]  Oh, yeah, yeah, stuff, yeah.
[02:11:25.148 --> 02:11:29.409]  Yeah, but basically, people ask me, it's just Irish-Italian.
[02:11:29.409 --> 02:11:31.090]  Well, there you go.
[02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:35.231]  So, it turns out you guys are distantly related, so you've come over and helped him.
[02:11:35.231 --> 02:11:36.331]  Where are you now, Mike?
[02:11:36.331 --> 02:11:38.412]  I mean, you've moved out now.
[02:11:39.707 --> 02:11:45.234]  Right now we are in, um, Tony here's sister's son's house?
[02:11:45.234 --> 02:11:46.055]  Or son's room?
[02:11:46.055 --> 02:11:47.437]  Yeah, my sister's house.
[02:11:47.437 --> 02:11:49.680]  This is my nephew's room.
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:52.023]  He's got the camera and the microphone.
[02:11:52.023 --> 02:11:52.804]  Now I understand.
[02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:54.306]  I'm saying, where are you moving?
[02:11:54.306 --> 02:11:55.988]  You're like in a hotel room or something?
[02:11:55.988 --> 02:11:57.911]  What are you going to get in your little baby bird nest?
[02:11:58.974 --> 02:12:08.003]  I'm going into an Airbnb for the next week or so, but Tony here said that after that I can stay with him for a long term, you know, a long period of time.
[02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:09.084]  That's nice of Tony.
[02:12:09.084 --> 02:12:10.025]  And he'll help you get a job.
[02:12:10.025 --> 02:12:12.167]  Maybe you guys can be reporters or something.
[02:12:12.167 --> 02:12:18.113]  What I'm asking you is, though, is don't you want to get your own nest?
[02:12:18.113 --> 02:12:20.275]  Because, you know, when you bring girls over or anything, you don't want, you know.
[02:12:21.903 --> 02:12:29.830]  But then you gotta take them out, you gotta buy the movie, and then you come back and nothing's done!
[02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:30.770]  You didn't get anything done!
[02:12:30.770 --> 02:12:31.611]  I don't know.
[02:12:31.611 --> 02:12:34.553]  Tell them you're liberal and they're racist and they don't buy you dinner.
[02:12:34.553 --> 02:12:35.294]  You gotta try that.
[02:12:35.294 --> 02:12:41.659]  Maybe.
[02:12:41.659 --> 02:12:43.861]  But you gotta understand, Mike, you gotta give to get.
[02:12:43.861 --> 02:12:46.183]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:46.183 --> 02:12:46.683]  Right.
[02:12:46.683 --> 02:12:48.705]  You can also go Dutch or whatever they call it.
[02:12:48.705 --> 02:12:50.467]  Is that what it's called where both people pay?
[02:12:51.577 --> 02:13:02.562]  Yeah, or I could go out with a woman who has very strong beliefs for women's rights and... Well, when I was a teenager, there were some housewives in the neighborhood that bought... Yeah, they'd take me out to dinner and stuff.
[02:13:02.562 --> 02:13:05.583]  Just as I was helping them paint their toenails.
[02:13:05.583 --> 02:13:07.264]  That's right.
[02:13:07.264 --> 02:13:09.245]  But that's a bit about it for... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:13:10.094 --> 02:13:11.895]  Was that a secret up until now?
[02:13:11.895 --> 02:13:13.256]  No, I'm just... I'm joking!
[02:13:13.256 --> 02:13:14.536]  You think I'm really that cool?
[02:13:14.536 --> 02:13:16.597]  Let's get serious.
[02:13:16.597 --> 02:13:27.082]  Here, all I'm saying is, I just... Well, you have a baby, and we want to get you back on your feet so you can get reunited with your ex, at least the point to be with your son, right?
[02:13:27.082 --> 02:13:28.423]  But that's not related to that.
[02:13:28.423 --> 02:13:33.605]  You can't take a father who's involved with a child out of that child's life.
[02:13:33.605 --> 02:13:38.367]  But if you got a job and you're back on your feet again, the court will let you start being with your son again.
[02:13:38.367 --> 02:13:39.108]  That's how that works.
[02:13:40.211 --> 02:13:41.392]  I disagree.
[02:13:41.392 --> 02:13:45.076]  I think that your child is a right and your child's right to a father is a right.
[02:13:45.076 --> 02:13:47.018]  Listen, I'm sure you got screwed over.
[02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:53.826]  I'm saying they won't be able to stop you if you... You basically said the court adjudicated you as having a screw loose.
[02:13:53.826 --> 02:13:55.027]  I'm saying prove them wrong.
[02:13:58.716 --> 02:14:03.917]  Mike, do you think I might be just a little bit smart?
[02:14:03.917 --> 02:14:04.858]  I'm not even that smart.
[02:14:04.858 --> 02:14:06.878]  I'm trying to give you basic advice.
[02:14:06.878 --> 02:14:08.178]  What's your buddy's name again?
[02:14:08.178 --> 02:14:09.679]  What's your name again, brother?
[02:14:09.679 --> 02:14:10.019]  Tony.
[02:14:10.019 --> 02:14:11.399]  Tony, an InfoWars listener.
[02:14:11.399 --> 02:14:12.799]  Can you get some sense into this guy?
[02:14:12.799 --> 02:14:18.441]  Yeah, he's going to be staying after he gets done with his B&B.
[02:14:18.441 --> 02:14:19.841]  I'm going to talk to him.
[02:14:19.841 --> 02:14:21.281]  I work.
[02:14:21.281 --> 02:14:25.322]  He's going to get a job and he's going to help pay for the food and the lights and all that, right?
[02:14:25.322 --> 02:14:25.842]  Yes.
[02:14:25.842 --> 02:14:27.803]  Or I want you to slap him upside his head right now.
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:30.140]  Yeah.
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:34.322]  In a month, if he's being a deadbeat, are you going to slug him in the face for me?
[02:14:34.322 --> 02:14:35.322]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:14:35.322 --> 02:14:36.482]  Hey, we can make money that way.
[02:14:36.482 --> 02:14:43.224]  I tell you what, Mike, if you don't get a job in the next month and start contributing, how about I pay you $5,000 to knock your teeth out?
[02:14:43.224 --> 02:14:45.905]  We can sign a contract.
[02:14:45.905 --> 02:14:47.346]  I'd rather have my teeth.
[02:14:47.346 --> 02:14:49.846]  It's going to cost a lot more than $5,000 to fix my teeth.
[02:14:49.846 --> 02:14:51.007]  Well, no, it'll be legal and lawful.
[02:14:51.007 --> 02:14:54.948]  I mean, in some states it might be illegal, but I'll knock your teeth out for $10,000.
[02:14:54.948 --> 02:14:55.428]  How's that sound?
[02:14:58.282 --> 02:14:59.803]  Just the front teeth.
[02:14:59.803 --> 02:15:06.305]  How about I break your nose?
[02:15:06.305 --> 02:15:07.645]  I'm just joking.
[02:15:07.645 --> 02:15:10.626]  I'm just getting a sound bite.
[02:15:10.626 --> 02:15:12.627]  Mike, I actually like you.
[02:15:12.627 --> 02:15:14.087]  You know what I think we're gonna do with you and Tony?
[02:15:14.087 --> 02:15:16.788]  I think we're gonna both hire you guys as auxiliary reporters.
[02:15:16.788 --> 02:15:17.288]  How's that sound?
[02:15:18.174 --> 02:15:21.095]  I would love that, personally, because I like your show.
[02:15:21.095 --> 02:15:22.875]  Me, personally, I would love that.
[02:15:22.875 --> 02:15:23.795]  I like your show, too.
[02:15:23.795 --> 02:15:26.716]  I just don't think I'm a reporter-type person.
[02:15:26.716 --> 02:15:31.417]  Hey, if I say you are and you want to make money, use your noggin.
[02:15:31.417 --> 02:15:33.618]  Tony, it's a package deal.
[02:15:33.618 --> 02:15:35.298]  I want you guys out there.
[02:15:35.298 --> 02:15:39.719]  I'm going to send you both to cover the Swedish bikini team.
[02:15:39.719 --> 02:15:41.419]  We'll do that internet for free.
[02:15:41.419 --> 02:15:43.300]  I'm thinking about going into comedy.
[02:15:44.349 --> 02:15:45.310]  Alright, now I'm serious.
[02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:50.274]  I'm gonna make you guys top sponsors of the Swedish bikini team this year.
[02:15:50.274 --> 02:15:52.296]  And I'll have you both there as oil boys.
[02:15:52.296 --> 02:15:52.797]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:55.327 --> 02:15:58.868]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[02:15:58.868 --> 02:16:01.088]  Fire your stockbroker and hire yourself.
[02:16:01.088 --> 02:16:05.069]  I'm Scott Bauer and I've been a professional trader for over 25 years.
[02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:10.390]  I've traded for Goldman Sachs and was the first Amazon market maker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
[02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:17.072]  I'm also the CEO here at Prosper Trading Academy, the leading educational firm teaching people how to trade the markets.

[02:17:29.216 --> 02:17:29.836]  Listen up!
[02:17:29.836 --> 02:17:38.500]  Before you sign up for some garbage program or awkward in-person seminar, you really need to hear about the online trader program that everyone's talking about.
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:42.802]  This is the program that allows you to get your account funded with someone else's money.
[02:17:42.802 --> 02:17:43.242]  That's right!
[02:17:43.542 --> 02:17:48.766]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:18:05.356 --> 02:18:16.204]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:18:16.204 --> 02:18:18.325]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:18:18.325 --> 02:18:22.308]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:22.308 --> 02:18:29.573]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:18:29.573 --> 02:18:31.954]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:18:31.954 --> 02:18:34.576]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:18:34.776 --> 02:18:37.379]  That's my dad, with a little silver and iodine as well.
[02:18:37.379 --> 02:18:40.363]  Infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[02:18:40.363 --> 02:18:49.074]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:18:49.074 --> 02:18:53.520]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:19:01.504]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:19:01.504 --> 02:19:02.084]  Thanks for calling.
[02:19:02.084 --> 02:19:03.506]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:19:03.506 --> 02:19:07.129]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:15.876]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was
[02:19:15.896 --> 02:19:32.181]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:19:32.641 --> 02:19:41.245]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:19:41.245 --> 02:19:46.148]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:19:46.148 --> 02:19:51.750]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:19:59.352 --> 02:20:09.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:22.130]  You know, a little bird told me that at the Pentagon, they actually called what's happening Operation 1776 Worldwide.
[02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:27.194]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:28.723 --> 02:20:36.129]  Isn't that funny that what Trump's doing is now being called 1776 worldwide?
[02:20:36.129 --> 02:20:37.870]  Where did I hear that?
[02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:43.995]  You watch, in the next year or so, you'll hear that term 1776 worldwide.
[02:20:43.995 --> 02:20:44.916]  Think about that!
[02:20:44.916 --> 02:20:46.717]  That's the power of ideas!
[02:20:50.063 --> 02:20:58.830]  Flesh and blood can go, but ideas, as long as humanity survives itself, are eternal.
[02:20:58.830 --> 02:21:11.159]  Alright, let's go back to Mike Rotondo and his cousin, distant cousin Tony, who's a listener, heard about it, went over and helped him.
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:16.022]  Mike, I'm telling you, I know you probably didn't get a fair shake.
[02:21:16.022 --> 02:21:21.426]  You'll get your son at least partially back if you get a job, show you got a place, show you're on your feet.
[02:21:21.426 --> 02:21:24.388]  I talked to you on air and in person about what happened to you in court, I get it.
[02:21:24.388 --> 02:21:25.809]  You got railroaded.
[02:21:25.809 --> 02:21:35.756]  But I'm saying, you have a right, sure, but you have to position yourself to show that, even if that's not a fair deal, there's hoops you gotta jump through in life, okay?
[02:21:35.756 --> 02:21:38.078]  It's like lifting weights, that's how you get stronger, okay?
[02:21:38.078 --> 02:21:39.839]  So that's all I'm saying, and then I'm like, hey,
[02:21:41.704 --> 02:21:45.066]  How would you like to do, occasionally, I'll say, I want you to go cover this.
[02:21:45.066 --> 02:21:48.709]  It can't be, well, you know, I'll say, hey, in a month I want you to go cover this.
[02:21:48.709 --> 02:21:54.633]  And I'll pay you both 500 bucks, and I'll send you the camera or whatever, or you can hire a camera guy, I'll pay them, and I want you to go cover this.
[02:21:54.633 --> 02:21:59.177]  Or I want you to go do personal on the street, and I want you to ask the questions I give you.
[02:21:59.177 --> 02:22:03.160]  We're talking a couple hours of work, you can send us the raw footage or get an editor, and you make money.
[02:22:04.161 --> 02:22:05.982]  And then you get known, and then it's fun.
[02:22:05.982 --> 02:22:08.462]  If you agree with our politics or like it, you could do that.
[02:22:08.462 --> 02:22:12.724]  But it's all like, well, I don't know, I'll do it this way, I'll do it that way.
[02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:21.246]  On getting yourself right with the court with your kid, on trying to get you a job, on trying to give you advice, you're like, well, well, I don't really see myself as this or that.
[02:22:21.246 --> 02:22:23.287]  Well, then what do you see yourself as?
[02:22:23.287 --> 02:22:27.888]  And hopefully when you're living with Tony here, he can, like, show you how to get this done.
[02:22:27.888 --> 02:22:30.649]  So let me hear from you, and I want to hear from Tony about his ideas.
[02:22:30.649 --> 02:22:30.869]  Go ahead.
[02:22:34.154 --> 02:22:38.235]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[02:22:38.235 --> 02:22:53.980]  I was talking to him personally about how much I like InfoWars and I thought, you know, when I heard you ask him to do some reporting for you, I was like, damn, that sounds like a really cool job.
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.761]  That's something I would like to do.
[02:22:55.761 --> 02:22:56.981]  I actually said that to him.
[02:22:57.828 --> 02:22:59.249]  Long before I even heard about it.
[02:22:59.249 --> 02:22:59.609]  It's a conspiracy.
[02:22:59.609 --> 02:23:00.169]  It's a conspiracy.
[02:23:00.169 --> 02:23:02.190]  Yeah, I really, I really don't.
[02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:08.294]  Yeah, conspiracies like Trump's going to win and we're going to go about 3% growth rate and G5 gives you brain cancer.
[02:23:08.294 --> 02:23:10.215]  Sure, it's not conspiracy theories.
[02:23:10.215 --> 02:23:11.216]  Yeah.
[02:23:11.216 --> 02:23:14.617]  I would really, yeah, no, I think that's great.
[02:23:14.617 --> 02:23:19.580]  Like to me, to me, that's a, that's a very, very good job.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:26.404]  Almost, I would almost classify it as like a dream job because I've been watching you for a very long time.
[02:23:28.343 --> 02:23:31.465]  Over, I'd say at least eight or nine years.
[02:23:31.465 --> 02:23:33.487]  Mike, what do you say to that?
[02:23:33.487 --> 02:23:43.715]  I say, Tony, if I, after this week where I iron out some legal matters, if I kickstart my business, would you do that with me?
[02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:44.375]  Yes, I would.
[02:23:44.375 --> 02:23:46.577]  Yes, I would.
[02:23:46.577 --> 02:23:47.778]  Now you've got to do that.
[02:23:47.778 --> 02:23:50.500]  No, I definitely would.
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:52.281]  Make an opportunity.
[02:23:52.281 --> 02:23:53.782]  You know, Mike, you are so funny.
[02:23:53.782 --> 02:23:55.644]  When we called you, Mike Rotonda,
[02:23:56.755 --> 02:23:58.937]  This week to get you back on, you're like, I'm really busy.
[02:23:58.937 --> 02:23:59.877]  I'm kind of big now.
[02:23:59.877 --> 02:24:01.038]  I got a lot of calls coming in.
[02:24:01.038 --> 02:24:02.719]  That's not what I said at all.
[02:24:02.719 --> 02:24:07.563]  You have such a ridiculous Cheshire Cat smile on your face.
[02:24:07.563 --> 02:24:12.086]  I mean, I'm really trying to figure out, because let me tell you something, you're weird in a good way.
[02:24:12.086 --> 02:24:18.771]  But I'm just showing how opportunity, people pass by opportunity all the time, don't even know it.
[02:24:18.771 --> 02:24:21.493]  But you've got to be positive enough to seize on it.
[02:24:21.493 --> 02:24:24.536]  See, I invest in you, actually give you the stuff I want you to do.
[02:24:25.635 --> 02:24:30.556]  I got so much on my plate, and all these great reporters have filed reports from England and Millie Weaver and all this.
[02:24:30.556 --> 02:24:31.557]  I've even played their reports.
[02:24:31.557 --> 02:24:32.677]  Paul Watson, everything.
[02:24:32.677 --> 02:24:34.198]  But I've got you on right now.
[02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.898]  I'm not bragging.
[02:24:35.898 --> 02:24:37.278]  I'm saying I've got you on.
[02:24:37.278 --> 02:24:42.120]  I'm trying to believe there's value in you.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.081]  Tony seems like a great guy, but you're just sitting there smiling like this is a big joke.
[02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:53.532]  Well, Tony's a great guy, I guess I'm not then.
[02:24:53.532 --> 02:24:55.554]  No, you're a good guy.
[02:24:55.554 --> 02:24:59.577]  I just don't see myself as a reporter.
[02:24:59.577 --> 02:25:08.824]  I just don't see that as something that... First, honestly, Alex, I was talking to a lot of people today, because today was the day I had to be out by noon, and I had CNN call me and I said,
[02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:11.692]  I'm really not doing this anymore.
[02:25:11.692 --> 02:25:12.452]  I'm really not.
[02:25:29.966 --> 02:25:36.828]  Change your worldview, and I don't want to say rehabilitate you, but I'm saying I would like to see you successful.
[02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:38.408]  I wouldn't want you to be a laughingstock.
[02:25:38.408 --> 02:25:43.429]  I want to make the globalists a laughingstock who have created a culture that produces people like you.
[02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:45.410]  You understand that?
[02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:53.112]  Yeah, the people who are, you know, out there thinking, oh, Mike Rotundo, what a laughingstock, living with his parents, got a job, you know, etc.
[02:25:54.784 --> 02:25:56.885]  I don't think those people's opinions matter.
[02:25:56.885 --> 02:26:05.028]  I don't think that... No, I know, but do you realize the judo, I'm not that smart, but when we do things right, when we hit holes in ones, we hit them.
[02:26:05.028 --> 02:26:18.253]  Okay, so what I'm saying to you is, what I'm getting at here is that do you understand that you can't just do everything perfectly the way your brain has it all figured out the way you want to go?
[02:26:18.253 --> 02:26:20.734]  That's how you end up being 30 years old in your parents' house.
[02:26:24.571 --> 02:26:32.276]  I think that that's how I mean, I understand that there's a lot of people who go through their whole lives like that and never wind up achieving those goals.
[02:26:32.276 --> 02:26:38.660]  But I think that I learned a lot simply by failing at those goals.
[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:44.084]  And I've learned a lot of really unique things that a lot of people I don't think have an opportunity to learn.
[02:26:44.084 --> 02:26:46.426]  I'm sure we learn from everything, don't we?
[02:26:46.426 --> 02:26:47.126]  Going back to Tony.
[02:26:47.126 --> 02:26:50.709]  Tony, you seem to like your distant cousin, Mr. Rotondo.
[02:26:50.709 --> 02:26:53.150]  I mean, what would you describe him like when he's not on air?
[02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:54.251]  Because I can't figure him out.
[02:26:55.723 --> 02:26:59.346]  Um, I can describe him as a really nice, quiet guy.
[02:26:59.346 --> 02:27:04.791]  I didn't know Mike prior to going to the house that day.
[02:27:04.791 --> 02:27:07.914]  I learned he was my cousin that day.
[02:27:07.914 --> 02:27:09.535]  So he lived around the corner from me.
[02:27:09.535 --> 02:27:12.377]  I didn't know that until that day.
[02:27:12.377 --> 02:27:15.320]  You know, he looks a little bit like Vlad the Impaler.
[02:27:16.738 --> 02:27:17.478]  A little bit.
[02:27:17.478 --> 02:27:20.240]  I'll get rid of the beard and the mustache when I'm back.
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.282]  Otherwise, he's got good manners.
[02:27:24.282 --> 02:27:25.282]  He's a good, nice guy.
[02:27:25.282 --> 02:27:26.563]  He's been really nice to me.
[02:27:26.563 --> 02:27:28.204]  He's easy to talk to with me.
[02:27:28.204 --> 02:27:30.625]  I think he's just a good dude.
[02:27:30.625 --> 02:27:31.125]  Well, good.
[02:27:31.125 --> 02:27:35.127]  What are you going to do in a month if he hasn't given you money for the groceries he's eaten and the power and the water?
[02:27:35.127 --> 02:27:37.669]  I already put a deposit down.
[02:27:37.669 --> 02:27:39.069]  He put a deposit down.
[02:27:39.069 --> 02:27:39.410]  He did.
[02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:45.253]  And I hope that he's working by then.
[02:27:46.448 --> 02:27:54.412]  Maybe, like you've already been saying, going the route that you have laid out.
[02:27:54.412 --> 02:27:56.773]  You know, you guys spoke.
[02:27:57.813 --> 02:27:59.915]  You know, it's just not, I mean, I came back from Ohio myself.
[02:27:59.915 --> 02:28:03.257]  Do you understand, let's do one more segment with you guys and we have another news, I appreciate it.
[02:28:03.257 --> 02:28:09.142]  Do you understand, Mike, I want to rub the media's nose in you being successful.
[02:28:09.142 --> 02:28:20.931]  Because they are the ones trying to make everybody like this, trying to arrest people's development, trying to break down the culture that pay them for all this free crap, for all these slobs, and then they point at you, like you're the bad guy to cover for what they are.
[02:28:20.931 --> 02:28:24.374]  I want you to transcend these people.
[02:28:24.374 --> 02:28:25.175]  Alex, you're telling me
[02:28:26.269 --> 02:28:34.396]  Straighten up, fly right, do these things, and you can have XYZ in a conventional and well-established way.
[02:28:34.396 --> 02:28:40.260]  And that's a very hard argument to... That's a very hard... It's hard to argue with that.
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:40.881]  Well, hold on.
[02:28:40.881 --> 02:28:44.704]  Let me hear the rest when we come back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:28:44.704 --> 02:28:48.247]  We'll be right back as we try to see where this guy's gonna go in the future.
[02:28:48.247 --> 02:28:50.309]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:52.791]  Tomorrow's news today, changing the world together.
[02:28:55.202 --> 02:28:58.884]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:28:58.884 --> 02:29:01.366]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:29:01.366 --> 02:29:03.588]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.
[02:29:03.588 --> 02:29:10.312]  The Biffy Bag is a pocket-sized disposable toilet that fits in your glove box, tackle box, toolbox, backpack or purse.
[02:29:10.312 --> 02:29:15.035]  The Biffy Bag has everything you need for a sanitary and comfortable relief experience.
[02:29:15.035 --> 02:29:18.838]  It's ready to use in just seconds and just toss it in the trash when you're done.

[02:29:25.462 --> 02:29:30.527]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:29:30.527 --> 02:29:35.891]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[02:29:35.891 --> 02:29:43.938]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[02:29:43.938 --> 02:29:49.382]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[02:29:49.382 --> 02:29:51.384]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:29:51.384 --> 02:29:53.246]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:59.853]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:59.853 --> 02:30:01.636]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:01.636 --> 02:30:12.909]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:22.874]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:22.874 --> 02:30:28.816]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:28.816 --> 02:30:33.918]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.918 --> 02:30:36.539]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.539 --> 02:30:38.260]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:43.062]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:30:43.302 --> 02:30:48.247]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:48.247 --> 02:30:50.890]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:50.890 --> 02:30:56.135]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:30:56.135 --> 02:31:00.139]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[02:31:00.139 --> 02:31:02.861]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[02:31:02.861 --> 02:31:07.206]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[02:31:07.646 --> 02:31:10.068]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:31:10.068 --> 02:31:13.089]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.
[02:31:13.089 --> 02:31:18.192]  bottles, Immune Gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen, or wherever you go.
[02:31:18.192 --> 02:31:24.896]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentist recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[02:31:24.896 --> 02:31:32.461]  As a powerful hand purifier or oral cleansing formula, just a small spray will help you stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[02:31:33.001 --> 02:31:40.208]  With powerful, yet simple ingredients, Immune Gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.

[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.302]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:55.902 --> 02:32:03.527]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:03.527 --> 02:32:11.452]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:11.452 --> 02:32:14.534]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:15.154 --> 02:32:19.819]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:19.819 --> 02:32:23.964]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:23.964 --> 02:32:27.087]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:27.087 --> 02:32:31.852]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:31.852 --> 02:32:34.896]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:35.316 --> 02:32:50.145]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:50.145 --> 02:32:51.926]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:51.926 --> 02:32:58.850]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:32:58.850 --> 02:33:01.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.019 --> 02:33:09.180]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:10.440]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:11.240]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:12.041]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.041 --> 02:33:12.701]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.701 --> 02:33:15.722]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.722 --> 02:33:25.306]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:33:25.306 --> 02:33:27.166]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:33:27.166 --> 02:33:30.908]  It's confirmed there are recent shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[02:33:32.318 --> 02:33:36.683]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:33:36.683 --> 02:33:37.144]  J.F.
[02:33:37.144 --> 02:33:39.847]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[02:33:39.847 --> 02:33:42.810]  It was almost as if there were plants in a boat.
[02:33:42.810 --> 02:33:44.152]  It just pancaked.
[02:33:44.152 --> 02:33:48.898]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the front lawns.
[02:33:49.658 --> 02:33:51.679]  I think this is a national security affair.
[02:33:51.679 --> 02:33:55.602]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[02:33:55.602 --> 02:33:59.084]  Operated in areas that we can't control.
[02:33:59.084 --> 02:34:00.084]  UFO!
[02:34:00.084 --> 02:34:02.225]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:34:02.225 --> 02:34:03.206]  Is it one world?
[02:34:03.206 --> 02:34:04.707]  The central bank is in charge.
[02:34:04.707 --> 02:34:06.888]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[02:34:06.888 --> 02:34:10.150]  But some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:13.492]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[02:34:13.692 --> 02:34:19.296]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[02:34:19.296 --> 02:34:20.697]  Russian scum!
[02:34:20.697 --> 02:34:21.657]  Denied everything!
[02:34:21.657 --> 02:34:23.138]  He called it all fake news!
[02:34:23.138 --> 02:34:26.020]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:28.061]  This is a national emergency.
[02:34:28.061 --> 02:34:33.825]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[02:34:33.825 --> 02:34:35.366]  This is a theme to high level a little.
[02:34:37.887 --> 02:34:41.388]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:34:41.388 --> 02:34:42.128]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:35:01.553 --> 02:35:08.417]  Mike Rotondo, the 30-year-old evicted out of his parents' house last week that the media made like the ultimate evil slob on the planet.
[02:35:08.417 --> 02:35:15.060]  Hillary, funding the Arab Spring, bragging about it, killing over a million people, putting hundreds of thousands of women and children into sex slavery.
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:16.221]  That's trendy and fun!
[02:35:16.221 --> 02:35:21.944]  The slave auctions are back open after being closed for over 100 years in North Africa.
[02:35:21.944 --> 02:35:25.526]  But him living with his parents, he's the worst guy in the world.
[02:35:25.526 --> 02:35:26.687]  I think he's eccentric.
[02:35:26.687 --> 02:35:29.228]  I think he's a little bit spoiled.
[02:35:29.228 --> 02:35:30.309]  But I gotta tell you something.
[02:35:31.872 --> 02:35:39.078]  I was just reading during the break, hundreds of more articles, and they describe people camped outside his house following him around.
[02:35:39.078 --> 02:35:41.780]  And I was reading where none of, he won't talk to any of them.
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:46.144]  So he's smart enough to not talk to mainstream media now, but to talk to us.
[02:35:46.144 --> 02:35:47.185]  I think that's a good thing.
[02:35:47.185 --> 02:35:52.670]  I'm just saying, sometimes you have to do other jobs, Mike, before you can then do your dream job.
[02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:59.715]  And I think you're a character, not just the news and the future, during your 15 minutes here, but for a way to you to see how the media works.
[02:36:00.652 --> 02:36:03.134]  I think you're not like a fixer-upper.
[02:36:03.134 --> 02:36:06.116]  I think you're more of an experiment for me to see how that goes.
[02:36:06.116 --> 02:36:11.580]  So if you show interest or whatever's going on, we can talk about doing some one-off reporting.
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:13.341]  Maybe you could cover stuff you like.
[02:36:13.341 --> 02:36:15.282]  And then we can air it or not.
[02:36:15.282 --> 02:36:18.084]  We put it out on the internet, but we can pay attention to it or not.
[02:36:18.084 --> 02:36:22.607]  I just think it's interesting and I think something synergistic is happening here.
[02:36:22.607 --> 02:36:26.710]  I didn't just want to say a jar of pickles about Hillary and the pop to just get on the news.
[02:36:29.130 --> 02:36:46.944]  The whole train of thought, it's usually when I'm exercising and there's a lot of blood in my brain, and I'm operating at a higher level, I envisioned how they would attack it, how it would be picked up, how everyone would do it, how they would find they were lying, and like Jimmy Kimmel, basically apologizing, and saying it's true, Alex Jones is right, the jar pops.
[02:36:46.944 --> 02:36:54.130]  And it's something stupid, but see, it's not stupid, it's something everyone can experience, that Hillary couldn't open a jar of pickles.
[02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:54.430]  You see?
[02:36:56.095 --> 02:36:57.817]  So that's how this works.
[02:36:57.817 --> 02:36:59.960]  It just shows how everything with her is fake.
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:01.601]  That's not how you open them anyways.
[02:37:01.601 --> 02:37:07.208]  And so I knew, though, that it would feed into the weird comic system.
[02:37:07.208 --> 02:37:08.910]  This is almost like mentally ill.
[02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:13.835]  I'm not explain all this stuff I do, but I really have the time energy to actually envision stuff.
[02:37:13.835 --> 02:37:15.257]  I just kind of rampage forward.
[02:37:15.257 --> 02:37:16.879]  But you get what I'm saying here, my friend.
[02:37:19.136 --> 02:37:32.007]  Alex, one of the last things that I said to my son before I was no longer able to see him was that, you know, you may find or you may hear that you're not going to see me anymore and that you're not going to see me, you know, ever again.
[02:37:32.007 --> 02:37:37.472]  And I told him that, you know, that that isn't true and to know that isn't true.
[02:37:37.472 --> 02:37:38.913]  And I want to see through that.
[02:37:41.435 --> 02:37:44.097]  I want to see it through with my rights to him.
[02:37:44.097 --> 02:37:51.404]  I want to see it through that I have the right to my child, and that my child has the right... And what, you've lost him for what, six years?
[02:37:51.404 --> 02:37:52.565]  Eight months.
[02:37:52.565 --> 02:37:54.666]  Okay, so you had him those years ago, eight months.
[02:37:54.666 --> 02:37:58.189]  Well, yeah, because you could lose pretty much in a year, year and a half.
[02:37:58.189 --> 02:38:00.351]  You need to, right now, just get going.
[02:38:00.351 --> 02:38:06.616]  You need to get a job, you need to get your place, you need to show that, and you need to stop trying to be a legal eagle yourself.
[02:38:06.616 --> 02:38:08.058]  I'm all for pros saying people know what they're doing.
[02:38:08.678 --> 02:38:11.500]  And if you got a good judge, they'll let you be pro se and let you be fair.
[02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:18.264]  But man, come on, you just gotta go, hey, I got a job now, everything's great, I didn't abuse my ex, you know, because I've looked at your case, there's none of that.
[02:38:18.264 --> 02:38:20.686]  The fact is, well, what did the court say then?
[02:38:20.686 --> 02:38:24.268]  You told me some of it privately, but I mean, how did this happen that eight months ago you lost your son?
[02:38:25.478 --> 02:38:29.461]  They connected some mental health issues I had.
[02:38:29.461 --> 02:38:34.504]  The most recent was probably early 2010.
[02:38:34.504 --> 02:38:38.566]  Who says mental health issues?
[02:38:38.566 --> 02:38:43.850]  I don't want to hear your... I mean, what is it?
[02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:46.832]  It was like stress-related.
[02:38:46.832 --> 02:38:51.995]  I was very hard on myself for weeks and not quite months, but nearly months.
[02:38:51.995 --> 02:38:54.777]  So did you go see a counselor and get it paid for via government?
[02:38:56.318 --> 02:39:07.613]  No, I saw a psychologist who wrote me a bill for a lifetime of mental health issues and that really, I guess you could say, didn't work for me.
[02:39:07.613 --> 02:39:11.438]  If you don't tell me the story, I can't help you because here's the thing.
[02:39:12.523 --> 02:39:13.444]  It's like Russian roulette.
[02:39:13.444 --> 02:39:15.826]  Some psychologists are great, some are terrible.
[02:39:15.826 --> 02:39:17.847]  It's all their own cult, it's all their own system.
[02:39:17.847 --> 02:39:21.690]  You know, it's some truth to it, but it's all just their template over reality.
[02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:22.952]  It's delusion.
[02:39:22.952 --> 02:39:24.633]  They're trying to play God, a lot of them.
[02:39:24.633 --> 02:39:26.454]  But did you hurt yourself?
[02:39:26.454 --> 02:39:27.495]  Did you get put in jail?
[02:39:27.495 --> 02:39:29.036]  Did you do anything wrong?
[02:39:29.036 --> 02:39:38.244]  Or did you just go have a breakdown, put in with the government because you didn't want to pay for the bill, got them to help you, and so then they adjudicated you incompetent and took your son?
[02:39:38.244 --> 02:39:39.125]  Because that's how that works.
[02:39:39.585 --> 02:39:40.665]  There's nothing for free.
[02:39:40.665 --> 02:39:50.907]  They want to get you on welfare, they want to get you in the system to take your child to say that you are a moron so they can break up families.
[02:39:50.907 --> 02:39:53.668]  I haven't had any issues since about eight years ago.
[02:39:53.668 --> 02:39:55.888]  How did you get in with them?
[02:39:55.888 --> 02:39:57.349]  Okay, you had an issue.
[02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:59.009]  How many years ago?
[02:39:59.009 --> 02:40:00.249]  Eight years ago?
[02:40:00.249 --> 02:40:06.771]  Yeah, eight years ago, but there was no significant... And is that when the... I mean, how old's your son?
[02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:07.091]  He's eight.
[02:40:08.314 --> 02:40:10.775]  Okay, so recently you had this issue.
[02:40:10.775 --> 02:40:13.557]  They used whatever was in the psychology record.
[02:40:13.557 --> 02:40:15.138]  You had the issue of your son.
[02:40:15.138 --> 02:40:16.579]  Tell me what the judge said.
[02:40:16.579 --> 02:40:17.939]  Just communicate.
[02:40:17.939 --> 02:40:21.762]  Why did you lose your son?
[02:40:21.762 --> 02:40:23.222]  I don't remember exactly what the judge said.
[02:40:23.222 --> 02:40:24.503]  It was kind of a blur.
[02:40:26.875 --> 02:40:32.177]  It was basically the findings were that it can only be supervised visitation with a mental health professional.
[02:40:32.177 --> 02:40:35.699]  So it meant I had to pay a professional for their time.
[02:40:35.699 --> 02:40:36.739]  I get it.
[02:40:36.739 --> 02:40:38.139]  Stop worrying about the money.
[02:40:38.139 --> 02:40:40.220]  The money will come.
[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:40.660]  I get it.
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:41.881]  Did you hurt yourself?
[02:40:41.881 --> 02:40:43.842]  Did you hurt your son?
[02:40:43.842 --> 02:40:46.063]  No.
[02:40:46.063 --> 02:40:48.023]  I was an excellent father since he was a baby.
[02:40:48.023 --> 02:40:50.404]  Yeah.
[02:40:50.404 --> 02:40:51.845]  So what, did you get a new boyfriend or something?
[02:40:53.766 --> 02:40:54.326]  That did happen.
[02:41:13.604 --> 02:41:24.911]  If you man up and start getting a job and become a reporter and kick ass, I will look, if you follow that stuff, at getting you a lawyer and exploring what went on.
[02:41:24.911 --> 02:41:29.014]  And if I find out your telling truth about you and your son, I will help you get a lawyer.
[02:41:29.014 --> 02:41:32.136]  Just the fact your ex sees this, things will start changing.
[02:41:32.136 --> 02:41:36.539]  But you've got to man up and stop trying to act like a baby and have it your way.
[02:41:36.539 --> 02:41:39.941]  Manning up is what I'm doing, Alex, by standing up for the government, which I'm not afraid of.
[02:41:40.669 --> 02:41:45.533]  I know, but if I know how to help you, and if I see you're telling the truth, there's ways to do this.
[02:41:45.533 --> 02:41:47.235]  You understand?
[02:41:47.235 --> 02:41:50.197]  Have you ever ridden a bull?
[02:41:50.197 --> 02:41:50.557]  The what?
[02:41:50.557 --> 02:41:53.400]  Have you ever ridden a bull?
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:53.980]  No.
[02:41:53.980 --> 02:41:55.402]  Oh, I've ridden a mechanical bull once.
[02:41:55.402 --> 02:41:57.383]  I didn't do very well.
[02:41:57.383 --> 02:41:58.464]  Me too.
[02:41:58.464 --> 02:42:04.009]  But you've listened to folks that have ridden a bull before.
[02:42:04.009 --> 02:42:05.670]  Right.
[02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:08.533]  No, I have not gotten advice from someone who's been bull riding.
[02:42:09.133 --> 02:42:12.334]  My point is that it's a dangerous thing you're involved in.
[02:42:12.334 --> 02:42:16.075]  You need to listen to people who have knowledge, not try to reinvent it yourself.
[02:42:16.075 --> 02:42:18.276]  You understand that?
[02:42:18.276 --> 02:42:24.597]  I think that my strategy and approach is really good.
[02:42:24.597 --> 02:42:30.019]  Well, you better do it the next... I don't know New York law, but it's pretty similar all over the country.
[02:42:30.019 --> 02:42:33.220]  Within a year and a half, if you're not with your son, they'll terminate your parental rights.
[02:42:34.454 --> 02:42:35.454]  What's he doing to this?
[02:42:35.454 --> 02:42:38.015]  That's a horse, not a bull.
[02:42:38.015 --> 02:42:41.336]  They don't scare me, Alex.
[02:42:41.336 --> 02:42:42.396]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:42:42.396 --> 02:42:43.816]  I'll finish up with both of you guys.
[02:42:43.816 --> 02:42:46.477]  I just... What I'm saying is you need to follow through, man.
[02:42:46.477 --> 02:42:48.598]  You need to follow through and get out of the haze.
[02:42:48.598 --> 02:42:49.178]  And just stop.
[02:42:49.178 --> 02:42:50.498]  He said, they don't scare me.
[02:42:50.498 --> 02:42:53.139]  Well, they better scare you, because you haven't had your son in eight months.

[02:47:09.756 --> 02:47:12.578]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:47:12.578 --> 02:47:20.163]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:47:20.163 --> 02:47:27.207]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:27.207 --> 02:47:28.588]  You know, I like Indians.
[02:47:29.724 --> 02:47:31.725]  You know, from the subcontinent, India.
[02:47:31.725 --> 02:47:35.666]  Every Indian I've ever met is hardworking, smart, kind of libertarian, doesn't like the system.
[02:47:35.666 --> 02:47:37.386]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[02:47:37.386 --> 02:47:39.327]  He wasn't even born in this country, was he?
[02:47:39.327 --> 02:47:45.429]  And he came here, ended up being in Reagan's cabinet when he wasn't even 30 years old because he earned it.
[02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:47.189]  He's super smart.
[02:47:47.189 --> 02:47:48.770]  He's super cool.
[02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:51.971]  And he doesn't buy into how they demonize me and say, don't come on the show.
[02:47:51.971 --> 02:47:52.791]  You know, he gets it.
[02:47:53.874 --> 02:47:55.534]  He just got pardoned by Trump.
[02:47:55.534 --> 02:48:01.456]  Now imagine a Dinesh D'Souza versus Mike Rotondo and his friend, who's a nice fellow.
[02:48:01.456 --> 02:48:03.956]  We're going to talk to him more in a second.
[02:48:03.956 --> 02:48:07.317]  I'm offering to mentor Mike Rotondo.
[02:48:07.317 --> 02:48:10.918]  If he said, oh, you're too radical, I don't agree with your politics, I'd say, oh, totally agree, got it.
[02:48:10.918 --> 02:48:15.399]  He said he likes my politics in here, on air, in the other studio when he was here last week.
[02:48:15.399 --> 02:48:17.840]  We did one in here and we did a live one in there as well.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:18.400]  Both of these are live.
[02:48:19.465 --> 02:48:22.188]  But we had commercial-free podcasts for the new podcast studio.
[02:48:22.188 --> 02:48:24.951]  And that was it, or I guess the long-form studio.
[02:48:24.951 --> 02:48:34.601]  And I'm sitting here trying to tell him, I mean, look, I've had my children for almost three years with supervised visits for their mom.
[02:48:34.601 --> 02:48:37.864]  And I didn't push for that, but that's what happened, because I knew what I was doing in the legal system.
[02:48:37.864 --> 02:48:39.626]  And now I have my children 50-50, and that's great.
[02:48:41.334 --> 02:48:45.996]  I'm sitting here, I've been through this, I'm telling you how to navigate stuff, and you just don't even want to hear what I'm saying.
[02:48:45.996 --> 02:48:49.718]  You're like, well, I don't know if I want a job, I don't know if I want this, I don't know if I want that.
[02:48:49.718 --> 02:48:52.259]  You have to do something, is what I'm getting at.
[02:48:52.259 --> 02:48:57.161]  And listen, we have the lowest unemployment ever recorded in modern history, 3.8%.
[02:48:57.161 --> 02:48:59.662]  Wages are going up, it's causing some inflation, nothing's perfect.
[02:49:00.502 --> 02:49:04.684]  You can get pretty good paying jobs everywhere right now if you're just willing to work.
[02:49:04.684 --> 02:49:08.285]  So, you keep saying, oh, I've got this job, oh, I've got this business.
[02:49:08.285 --> 02:49:09.446]  We don't want your secret.
[02:49:09.446 --> 02:49:11.526]  We don't want your genie in the bottle.
[02:49:11.526 --> 02:49:16.588]  Tell us, so it's not, you know, just stuff in the air.
[02:49:16.588 --> 02:49:20.530]  Tell me what it is you're planning to do as a business.
[02:49:20.530 --> 02:49:21.690]  Tell me.
[02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:28.013]  Well, I just had someone reach out to me yesterday that develops an app in the area and
[02:49:29.052 --> 02:49:30.853]  So you have skills in building apps?
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:48.331]  There's, he said there's a lot of different things that I could do.
[02:49:48.331 --> 02:49:58.465]  I don't necessarily need to be a programmer, but a lot of the things about what their business needs are things that I was actually, well the things that I'm very interested in.
[02:49:58.465 --> 02:50:01.389]  What is that?
[02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:02.491]  Different types of data analysis.
[02:50:05.302 --> 02:50:08.244]  Data analysis.
[02:50:08.244 --> 02:50:13.187]  Tony, we're going to get you guys back on as this unfolds, but let me ask you about this.
[02:50:13.187 --> 02:50:13.867]  What do you know?
[02:50:13.867 --> 02:50:19.570]  Do you know anything about your friend saying that he doesn't want to ever see his parents again?
[02:50:19.570 --> 02:50:20.631]  I think that's kind of mean.
[02:50:20.631 --> 02:50:22.332]  I think we should encourage him to see his parents again.
[02:50:22.332 --> 02:50:24.833]  And also, did you call the police on him?
[02:50:24.833 --> 02:50:26.874]  Let me ask Mike before we go back to Tony.
[02:50:26.874 --> 02:50:29.276]  Mike, did you call the police on your parents about the toys?
[02:50:30.703 --> 02:50:39.189]  The toys and inheritance of mine that my father was trying to prevent me from receiving.
[02:50:39.189 --> 02:50:51.598]  So, I thought you told me, because I'm reading this off of Syracuse.com, I thought you told me, this was just posted today, I thought you told me you moved out with your distant cousin, but it's saying you got evicted.
[02:50:55.330 --> 02:50:58.693]  I had to be out by noon today, and I did that.
[02:50:58.693 --> 02:51:00.134]  Well, did your dad take your toys?
[02:51:00.134 --> 02:51:02.676]  I mean, did you carry your toys out?
[02:51:02.676 --> 02:51:05.538]  It's my son's toys.
[02:51:05.538 --> 02:51:08.040]  My toys, I don't characterize as toys.
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:09.221]  I'm not being mean here.
[02:51:09.221 --> 02:51:10.982]  I'm trying, I'm saying, is the story accurate?
[02:51:10.982 --> 02:51:12.383]  Let's roll some of the video in the background.
[02:51:12.383 --> 02:51:12.924]  What happened?
[02:51:12.924 --> 02:51:15.386]  What happened at the house?
[02:51:15.386 --> 02:51:23.332]  I asked my father for, you know, for additional toys that were in the basement, which is locked, and things in there are not available to me.
[02:51:24.008 --> 02:51:24.769]  I don't think so.
[02:51:38.781 --> 02:51:49.928]  Something about... I don't remember how the conversation actually went, but basically, my father said to me, I bear the burden of proof to name items which are not available to me, and if they are found, they will be produced... Well, you have been there.
[02:51:49.928 --> 02:51:50.228]  You're 30.
[02:51:50.228 --> 02:51:56.792]  I mean, you've had time to get this stuff together instead of the hour you're supposed to be out.
[02:51:56.792 --> 02:51:58.834]  You know what possession is nine-tenths of the law means?
[02:51:58.834 --> 02:52:01.855]  That's his house, his castle, his property.
[02:52:01.855 --> 02:52:04.177]  If you didn't get your crap out before, it's not his problem.
[02:52:04.844 --> 02:52:05.524]  I didn't.
[02:52:05.524 --> 02:52:07.485]  I didn't get it out.
[02:52:07.485 --> 02:52:08.965]  This was all prior to noon today.
[02:52:08.965 --> 02:52:12.546]  This was actually yesterday.
[02:52:12.546 --> 02:52:16.527]  God, Mike, what I'm telling you is it's not your dad's fault you didn't get your crap out.
[02:52:16.527 --> 02:52:21.268]  The very day you're supposed to be out, it's not his fault it's not out.
[02:52:21.268 --> 02:52:22.189]  I did get my crap out.
[02:52:22.189 --> 02:52:29.330]  He actually, after the police left, he mysteriously found it after the police told me that I had to file a civil suit.
[02:52:29.330 --> 02:52:31.071]  Why didn't you just go get the toys yourself?
[02:52:31.903 --> 02:52:38.127]  I, that's not, that's very confrontational, Alex, and very unwise with the, because you can cause- Wait, you were already in that, where's video?
[02:52:38.127 --> 02:52:39.348]  You carrying stuff out of the house.
[02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:41.909]  What, he said you can't go in the basement?
[02:52:41.909 --> 02:52:42.349]  Correct.
[02:52:42.349 --> 02:52:43.950]  Okay, now, there you go.
[02:52:43.950 --> 02:52:45.631]  Then my dad wouldn't let me in the basement.
[02:52:45.631 --> 02:52:46.712]  Well, now I see you got a point.
[02:52:46.712 --> 02:52:48.233]  I'm not trying to be a jerk here, man.
[02:52:48.233 --> 02:52:52.476]  I'm trying to get you to, like, face up to consequences.
[02:52:52.476 --> 02:52:56.318]  What is your response to me saying there's so many jobs out there right now because of unemployment being so low?
[02:52:58.631 --> 02:53:03.695]  I'm hoping that I can get a job with this company who contacted me yesterday.
[02:53:03.695 --> 02:53:05.537]  I'm hoping that that would work out.
[02:53:05.537 --> 02:53:09.319]  Well, I want to thank Tommy, your distant cousin, for being a listener and hearing about this.
[02:53:09.319 --> 02:53:09.920]  I'm proud to help you.
[02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:12.302]  And I appreciate what you're doing because he needs some guidance.
[02:53:12.302 --> 02:53:14.724]  We're not having Mike on to talk down to him here.
[02:53:14.724 --> 02:53:17.446]  He's smart in many ways.
[02:53:17.446 --> 02:53:19.487]  How would you describe him, Tony?
[02:53:19.487 --> 02:53:22.970]  Because there's something weird.
[02:53:22.970 --> 02:53:28.054]  I would just describe him as a little bit quirky.
[02:53:29.372 --> 02:53:30.313]  But a good guy.
[02:53:30.313 --> 02:53:32.954]  He seems a little quirky.
[02:53:32.954 --> 02:53:43.458]  I had my little suspicions of maybe a little bit of Asperger's.
[02:53:43.458 --> 02:53:47.559]  Actually, the room we're sitting in is my nephew's, which he has.
[02:53:47.559 --> 02:53:51.861]  My nephew has autism.
[02:53:51.861 --> 02:53:52.842]  You know, and I've seen that.
[02:53:52.842 --> 02:53:53.442]  That's what really
[02:53:55.256 --> 02:53:56.499]  Hit me in the heart a little bit.
[02:53:56.499 --> 02:54:04.754]  I heard you say that, and I wanted to make sure, you know, I went over and, um, just seeing that he was alright, because I'm a good person at my heart, you know, and I'm just a good person.
[02:54:04.754 --> 02:54:05.897]  Tony, I think that's it.
[02:54:05.897 --> 02:54:06.237]  I think...
[02:54:07.754 --> 02:54:10.235]  Mike is a little bit autistic, and I'm not trying to diagnose this.
[02:54:10.235 --> 02:54:11.576]  I'm not a medical doctor.
[02:54:11.576 --> 02:54:14.337]  He just has that thing.
[02:54:14.337 --> 02:54:15.638]  No, if I have it, that's fine.
[02:54:15.638 --> 02:54:21.780]  I mean, if I have it and it can get diagnosed, there's professionals who know how to help me, I'm sure.
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:24.842]  But, you know, it doesn't matter to me if I have that or not.
[02:54:25.622 --> 02:54:26.463]  No, you're not bad.
[02:54:26.463 --> 02:54:28.104]  I've got my own issues, I'm sure.
[02:54:28.104 --> 02:54:32.888]  They have names for it, I'm sure, but it's what they project on.
[02:54:32.888 --> 02:54:35.491]  I'm just saying, there's a lot of chemical in the environment.
[02:54:35.491 --> 02:54:37.913]  Our brains, for a while, were getting bigger.
[02:54:37.913 --> 02:54:42.576]  People who have really big brains tend to have a lot of wiring issues.
[02:54:43.377 --> 02:54:49.001]  So, you know, there's a fine line between idiot savants and, you know, people that are mentally retarded.
[02:54:49.001 --> 02:54:49.961]  I'm not saying you're retarded.
[02:54:49.961 --> 02:54:52.863]  You're there, you're smart, you make witty comments, but you don't get it.
[02:54:52.863 --> 02:54:53.723]  You don't connect.
[02:54:53.723 --> 02:54:55.104]  And you're not doing it as a jerk.
[02:54:55.104 --> 02:54:56.925]  You're just kind of in your own world.
[02:54:56.925 --> 02:55:00.848]  And so I just, I was just hoping that we could try to help you out.
[02:55:00.848 --> 02:55:05.251]  Tony, maybe you can work with him and figure out some things he wants to report on.
[02:55:05.251 --> 02:55:09.073]  I'm not gonna, I don't think it's a pearls before swine situation with you.
[02:55:11.708 --> 02:55:15.150]  Yeah, I would like to, I would take you up on that offer.
[02:55:15.150 --> 02:55:16.091]  I would do that with him.
[02:55:16.091 --> 02:55:18.012]  I would report for Info Wars.
[02:55:18.012 --> 02:55:20.554]  I would love to do it.
[02:55:20.554 --> 02:55:21.935]  I don't want to be a public figure anymore.
[02:55:21.935 --> 02:55:25.157]  In fact, I'm thinking that this interview here may be ending my dialogue with the public.
[02:55:25.157 --> 02:55:30.301]  But is it alright, what if I go with Tony and Tony does the actual reporting?
[02:55:30.301 --> 02:55:32.162]  What if, can we do that?
[02:55:32.162 --> 02:55:32.762]  Yeah!
[02:55:32.762 --> 02:55:35.004]  I mean, I think that's an idea, absolutely.
[02:55:36.056 --> 02:55:37.497]  Okay, so let's do that.
[02:55:37.497 --> 02:55:42.182]  If Tony's the guy in the public eye... We'll work something out.
[02:55:42.182 --> 02:55:44.624]  Now, we've still got to add the fact that you're involved in it somehow, but yeah.
[02:55:44.624 --> 02:55:45.985]  No, I think that's reasonable.
[02:55:45.985 --> 02:55:48.087]  So you're negotiating.
[02:55:48.087 --> 02:55:49.308]  And you're navigating things.
[02:55:51.499 --> 02:55:55.781]  I'll be creative, I think.
[02:55:55.781 --> 02:55:57.061]  So I'll help.
[02:55:57.061 --> 02:55:59.462]  A lot of times the reporter is creative.
[02:55:59.462 --> 02:56:01.462]  That's what you want is reporters that operate on their own.
[02:56:01.462 --> 02:56:03.303]  Alright guys, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:56:03.303 --> 02:56:04.083]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:56:04.083 --> 02:56:07.244]  We'll get a chapter two hopefully next week.
[02:56:07.244 --> 02:56:09.105]  So if you want to come back with us, that'd be great.
[02:56:09.105 --> 02:56:10.885]  And we'll just move forward.
[02:56:10.885 --> 02:56:12.626]  So have a great weekend coming up.
[02:56:12.626 --> 02:56:14.186]  He's going to contact you.
[02:56:14.186 --> 02:56:15.407]  Pardon me?
[02:56:15.407 --> 02:56:16.347]  Tony's going to contact you.
[02:56:17.921 --> 02:56:20.783]  Tony is going to contact you about what you want.
[02:56:20.783 --> 02:56:21.403]  I get it.
[02:56:21.403 --> 02:56:22.624]  Don't talk to you.
[02:56:22.624 --> 02:56:25.306]  Talk to your manager.
[02:56:25.306 --> 02:56:26.367]  Alright.
[02:56:26.367 --> 02:56:28.628]  We'll start getting you limos, helicopters, everything.
[02:56:28.628 --> 02:56:29.789]  You'll have your own airplane like Trump.
[02:56:29.789 --> 02:56:32.211]  Aircraft carriers.
[02:56:32.211 --> 02:56:33.652]  Alright guys.
[02:56:33.652 --> 02:56:37.934]  Hey, in fact, since that's his manager now, let me talk to Tony.
[02:56:37.934 --> 02:56:39.215]  So let's get Tony's number.
[02:56:39.215 --> 02:56:40.516]  Thank you guys.
[02:56:40.516 --> 02:56:40.976]  I'll see you guys.
[02:56:40.976 --> 02:56:41.617]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:43.038 --> 02:56:44.359]  See, he's kind of a comic.
[02:56:44.359 --> 02:56:47.422]  He needs to go nationally as a comic.
[02:56:47.422 --> 02:56:49.503]  He's pretty funny.
[02:56:49.503 --> 02:56:52.366]  He's just nothing compared to people who make me pay for their sex changes and abortions.
[02:56:52.366 --> 02:57:01.333]  I'm sorry, I'm not going to hate the guy because he is somewhat of a deadbeat.
[02:57:01.333 --> 02:57:03.675]  We'll see what happens.
[02:57:03.675 --> 02:57:08.018]  I'm trying not to be a deadbeat, but to fight Soros, the Globals, the whole New World Order, I need your funding.
[02:57:08.018 --> 02:57:10.100]  See, at the end of the day, we all help each other.
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:11.421]  Plus, it's a win-win.
[02:57:11.421 --> 02:57:12.101]  I have items.
[02:57:13.086 --> 02:57:13.546]  Products.
[02:57:13.546 --> 02:57:14.667]  The best supplements.

[02:57:16.168 --> 02:57:16.789]  It's explosive.
[02:57:16.789 --> 02:57:17.669]  It's dangerous.
[02:57:17.669 --> 02:57:19.010]  Our products are amazing.
[02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.611]  They're high quality.

[02:57:41.616 --> 02:57:46.078]  Stay with us, I've got more to add about the big North Korea developments.
[02:57:46.078 --> 02:57:50.639]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:50.639 --> 02:57:51.219]  Thanks for calling.
[02:57:51.219 --> 02:57:52.660]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:57:52.660 --> 02:57:56.261]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:57:56.261 --> 02:58:05.003]  I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:58:05.043 --> 02:58:21.296]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[02:58:21.796 --> 02:58:30.405]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:58:30.405 --> 02:58:35.291]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:58:35.291 --> 02:58:40.916]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:58:46.849 --> 02:58:51.691]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:51.691 --> 02:59:01.154]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:01.154 --> 02:59:05.935]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:14.198]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[02:59:14.318 --> 02:59:14.638]  I think so.
[02:59:49.351 --> 02:59:51.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:06.289 --> 03:00:10.572]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[03:00:10.572 --> 03:00:14.374]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:14.374 --> 03:00:20.878]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:00:20.878 --> 03:00:31.824]  We just had the main North Korean delegation leader meet at the White House after lining it up with Pompeo yesterday that they are agreeing to unconditional denuclearization in exchange for
[03:00:32.992 --> 03:00:35.394]  Economic boosting help and things like that.
[03:00:35.394 --> 03:00:36.275]  This is a big victory.
[03:00:36.275 --> 03:00:41.259]  We expected negotiations to go back and forth on all of this.
[03:00:41.259 --> 03:00:54.570]  And the media tried to then act like, oh, it's all derailed because it didn't happen right away and cheerleading that this thing would all be off the rails because they've kept the Korean Peninsula in crisis for 60 plus years.
[03:00:54.570 --> 03:00:58.053]  Trump says June 12th summit with Kim Jong-un is back on.
[03:00:59.428 --> 03:01:09.196]  President Trump said Friday he will meet with Kim Jong-un in Singapore later this month after all ending more than a week of uncertainty about whether direct denuclearization talks would go on.
[03:01:09.196 --> 03:01:22.227]  Key North Korean official Kim Jong-chol, who is sanctioned under the 2014 Sony cyber attack, talked to Trump in the Oval Office for more than an hour on Friday and delivered a letter from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
[03:01:22.227 --> 03:01:22.607]  In the letter,
[03:01:23.428 --> 03:01:29.100]  The head of the communist dictatorship was expected to show interest in a meeting with Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported.
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:33.870]  And basically agreed to go along with a basic framework or there won't be a meeting.
[03:01:35.527 --> 03:01:38.029]  The latest, Trump says June 12th summit back on.
[03:01:38.029 --> 03:01:38.850]  So that's going on.
[03:01:38.850 --> 03:01:42.033]  Just recapping before Dr. Nick Baggage takes over and hosts today.
[03:01:42.033 --> 03:01:49.619]  What we're going to be breaking down on the war room coming up at 3 o'clock with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone and everything else that's happening.
[03:01:49.619 --> 03:01:54.022]  Comey grilled as Fed seriously considered charging McCabe in criminal referral.
[03:01:54.022 --> 03:01:55.444]  That's been reported in the Washington Post.
[03:01:55.444 --> 03:01:57.986]  We told you that back in March.
[03:01:57.986 --> 03:01:58.886]  So it's happening.
[03:01:58.886 --> 03:02:02.689]  Trey Gowdy, recent activity highlights deep state action against Devin Nunes.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:16.506]  Something has been increasingly weird about DOJ and FBI at releasing the two-page electronic communication that was written by CIA Director John Brennan to initiate the July 2016
[03:02:18.615 --> 03:02:23.556]  Counterintelligence operation against the campaign president, this candidate Donald Trump.
[03:02:23.556 --> 03:02:37.180]  And then it just goes on to break down that there's something according to the CIA director John Brennan's testimony he personally briefed the gang of eight members including Devin Nunes individually 2016 on the orientation document.
[03:02:37.180 --> 03:02:42.922]  As such 2018 Devin Nunes would be only seeking a review of the document he was already briefed on.
[03:02:44.215 --> 03:02:54.839]  It just doesn't make sense unless, well unless the Brennan Organization document and the briefing Brennan gave the White House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes doesn't match and that's the reason.
[03:02:54.839 --> 03:03:02.362]  And that goes on to show how Gowdy has worked to block all that and block the investigations of the FBI and block getting those documents out.
[03:03:02.362 --> 03:03:10.445]  Removing Nunes allows the placement and the controlled agent Gowdy, the DC process of putting strategic political person in the center of the known risk is very familiar.
[03:03:11.573 --> 03:03:13.834]  This goes into all the things Trey Gowdy has done.
[03:03:13.834 --> 03:03:17.956]  That's a conservative freehouse breakdown of that.
[03:03:17.956 --> 03:03:18.556]  There's another one.
[03:03:18.556 --> 03:03:19.036]  Sources.
[03:03:19.036 --> 03:03:19.676]  Trey Gowdy.
[03:03:19.676 --> 03:03:20.937]  Big League Politics.
[03:03:20.937 --> 03:03:24.438]  Blocked investigation into the FBI.
[03:03:24.438 --> 03:03:28.880]  And then it goes over some of the background of that.
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:31.301]  A lot to digest there, but the good news is
[03:03:34.693 --> 03:03:36.273]  Trump is turning the economy back on.
[03:03:36.273 --> 03:03:39.914]  He's definitely challenging the existing power structure that wants crisis.
[03:03:39.914 --> 03:03:43.475]  Letting people have access to all these hidden treatments and cures.
[03:03:43.475 --> 03:03:44.935]  He's accelerated.
[03:03:44.935 --> 03:03:46.916]  That's a big win in my view.
[03:03:46.916 --> 03:03:52.017]  But he needs to start talking about 5G, vaccines, everything that is hitting us and attacking us.
[03:03:52.017 --> 03:03:57.418]  If you love your children, if you love your own life, we've got to look at the larger master plan and what's behind all this.
[03:03:57.418 --> 03:03:59.659]  And Dr. Nick Begich, who pioneered
[03:04:00.726 --> 03:04:01.627]  Exposing all of this.
[03:04:01.627 --> 03:04:03.888]  His father, a famous congressman that died mysteriously.
[03:04:03.888 --> 03:04:05.229]  His brother was a U.S.
[03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.569]  Senator.
[03:04:05.569 --> 03:04:08.210]  If you don't know who Dr. Nick Begich is, you need to find out.
[03:04:08.210 --> 03:04:10.191]  EarthPulse.com is the website.
[03:04:10.191 --> 03:04:11.652]  We had Dinesh D'Souza on earlier.
[03:04:11.652 --> 03:04:13.974]  That interview is going up on InfoWars.com.
[03:04:13.974 --> 03:04:18.356]  Dinesh D'Souza gives exclusive details of his conversations with Trump and being pardoned.
[03:04:18.356 --> 03:04:21.658]  That just went up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:04:21.658 --> 03:04:24.500]  So we'll come back with Dr. Nick Begich on the other side.
[03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:27.681]  He'll be hosting the rest of this transmission.
[03:04:27.681 --> 03:04:28.462]  Please spread
[03:04:29.648 --> 03:04:31.909]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:31.909 --> 03:04:34.651]  They don't censor and block on Twitter and Facebook those links as much.
[03:04:34.651 --> 03:04:35.852]  InfoWars, they do.
[03:04:35.852 --> 03:04:41.595]  You can test it out for yourselves, but realize, you individually, all together in a mass, is unstoppable.
[03:04:41.595 --> 03:04:52.342]  That's why I'm begging you to just continue to realize, every day, reach out and tell folks about local stations you're listening to, or spread those links, or subscribe to our free newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:04:54.383 --> 03:04:58.348]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.348 --> 03:05:01.632]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.632 --> 03:05:07.921]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.921 --> 03:05:10.684]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.425 --> 03:05:15.230]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:21.718]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.718 --> 03:05:26.684]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.423 --> 03:05:31.345]  Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.345 --> 03:05:38.549]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.549 --> 03:05:43.251]  As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.251 --> 03:05:49.455]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.455 --> 03:05:53.437]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:06.084 --> 03:06:14.112]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:14.112 --> 03:06:17.255]  The world is at a crossroads deciding its future.
[03:06:17.255 --> 03:06:22.660]  The globalist deep state eugenicists, the social engineers have decided they want a post-human future.
[03:06:22.660 --> 03:06:25.502]  Dr. Nick Begich is a leading, not futurist,
[03:06:26.383 --> 03:06:32.866]  He is a futurist, but at the same time, reverse engineering from their own documents, their own patents, their own admissions, the master plan.
[03:06:32.866 --> 03:06:35.387]  So we're trying to get a nationalist beachhead.
[03:06:35.387 --> 03:06:36.688]  We're trying to have free market.
[03:06:36.688 --> 03:06:38.248]  That gives us some choice.
[03:06:38.248 --> 03:06:40.429]  We're just trying to get basic things turned back on.
[03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:42.250]  But what's at the bottom of the swamp?
[03:06:42.250 --> 03:06:45.011]  What's behind the swamp?
[03:06:45.011 --> 03:06:48.953]  This will be an intriguing 54 minutes we have left.
[03:06:48.953 --> 03:06:50.394]  Dr. Nick Begich, please take over.
[03:06:50.394 --> 03:06:50.974]  Thanks for being with us.
[03:06:51.957 --> 03:06:52.918]  Thanks for having me.
[03:06:52.918 --> 03:06:59.742]  You know, it's great to be substituting a little bit here and there and stepping in for Alex.
[03:06:59.742 --> 03:07:03.965]  And there are so many issues that we can get into.
[03:07:03.965 --> 03:07:11.490]  And I want to talk about, because today we get the jobs report, we've got some of the best economic news ever.
[03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:19.775]  And I want to talk a little bit about what's going on in Alaska from the standpoint of resources and what it means for the country right now.
[03:07:20.319 --> 03:07:28.366]  You know, Alaska represents 18% of all of the land in the United States.
[03:07:28.366 --> 03:07:34.370]  18%, and yet we have here about three quarters of a million people scattered over that landscape.
[03:07:34.370 --> 03:07:40.916]  Most of it's inaccessible, and yet we are, in fact, the treasure house of the nation.
[03:07:40.916 --> 03:07:46.080]  And I want to get into that a little bit today to put some of this in perspective against the backdrop
[03:07:46.684 --> 03:07:52.258]  Of multinationals what's happening right now with China's look at Alaska as a resource.
[03:07:52.888 --> 03:07:59.853]  Um, really colony, if you will, in the way we've been treated both in the United States and elsewhere.
[03:07:59.853 --> 03:08:13.642]  When you look at the coastline of Alaska, which is up on the screen right now, you can see Alaska's coastline is bigger than the east, west, and gulf coast of the continental United States combined.
[03:08:13.642 --> 03:08:17.645]  We stretch almost all the way to Japan and almost touching Russia.
[03:08:18.283 --> 03:08:24.715]  Um, if you can see it at one point, we're only 40 miles apart when you get up into the straight.
[03:08:24.715 --> 03:08:31.387]  So you've got a 2000 mile long Aleutian chain going from Anchorage to Southeast Alaska.
[03:08:31.846 --> 03:08:37.808]  You have almost 1,500 miles, and from Anchorage to the top of the state, 700 miles.
[03:08:37.808 --> 03:08:40.809]  So huge, huge areas.
[03:08:40.809 --> 03:08:57.895]  When you think of the coastal areas of Alaska as a resource, again, bigger than the east, west, and gulf coast of the United States combined is Alaska, with a 200-mile economic limit for the federal government and a three-mile economic limit for the state of Alaska.
[03:08:58.433 --> 03:09:02.315]  Now what does that mean, when you think about resources?
[03:09:02.315 --> 03:09:08.558]  Alaska has half of the known coal, known coal resources in the world.
[03:09:08.558 --> 03:09:18.603]  We have a huge hydrocarbon base, both in natural gas and oil, on the North Slope of Alaska.
[03:09:18.603 --> 03:09:26.427]  In fact, the northern region of Alaska, above the Brooks Range, stretching out into the ocean almost all the way to the North Pole,
[03:09:27.009 --> 03:09:31.191]  is one of the last great oil and gas basins in the world.
[03:09:31.191 --> 03:09:37.734]  In the last couple of years, major discoveries have been made and are being made on the North Slope of Alaska.
[03:09:37.734 --> 03:09:41.616]  That will add even greater to the ability of the U.S.
[03:09:41.616 --> 03:09:48.219]  to be a net exporter of oil and gas, which we currently are quickly approaching.
[03:09:48.219 --> 03:09:52.541]  That changes the dynamic of everything when you're looking into the rest of the world.
[03:09:52.541 --> 03:09:56.143]  Do you know, in Alaska, we have no gas line yet built
[03:09:56.616 --> 03:10:07.843]  After 40 years of operating an oil pipeline, we have no gas line to bring gas from the North Slope of Alaska into the Pacific Rim, the biggest, most expanding markets in the world.
[03:10:07.843 --> 03:10:14.827]  Natural resources in our state comprise the biggest base left in the country.
[03:10:14.827 --> 03:10:25.753]  We have every strategic mineral in mineable quantities here, and some of the biggest mines operating in the world here, and most Americans don't even know it.
[03:10:26.368 --> 03:10:36.477]  When you look at the natural resource base, and I want to get into the history of that, because that's what led to the very beginnings of our state.
[03:10:36.477 --> 03:10:42.863]  When you go back in time to the very first fur traders, the Russian fur traders that came into
[03:10:43.283 --> 03:10:48.906]  The Aleutian chain, they enslaved the indigenous there and turned them into trappers.
[03:10:48.906 --> 03:11:01.954]  All of that that was essentially wiped out was shipped into China and in Asia back in the 17 and early 1800s until the Russians theoretically exhausted what was here.
[03:11:01.954 --> 03:11:10.539]  In the late, in middle 1800s, the United States was moving west and we were taking up the western states.
[03:11:11.292 --> 03:11:14.195]  Uh, in Canada was competing for Alaska.
[03:11:14.195 --> 03:11:17.739]  Russia had a foothold here, but the czar was weak.
[03:11:17.739 --> 03:11:21.162]  And at that time, uh, they made a deal with the United States.
[03:11:21.162 --> 03:11:24.366]  It was called the Treaty of Secession.
[03:11:24.366 --> 03:11:29.911]  1867, we took possession of the state of Alaska at two cents an acre, a little over seven million bucks.
[03:11:29.911 --> 03:11:31.393]  We bought the whole program here.
[03:11:32.009 --> 03:11:33.731]  Now, there's a lot of dispute about that.
[03:11:33.731 --> 03:11:35.472]  We're not going to get into that today.
[03:11:35.472 --> 03:11:39.175]  Maybe another time we'll get into some of that history.
[03:11:39.175 --> 03:11:43.699]  But to talk about the next stage, sort of what happened after 1867.
[03:11:43.699 --> 03:11:51.125]  You know, it was in 1898 that gold was beginning to be discovered in the Klondike.
[03:11:51.125 --> 03:11:55.488]  It led to a huge rush into Alaska.
[03:11:55.488 --> 03:11:58.811]  Shortly thereafter, again in the late 1800s,
[03:12:00.411 --> 03:12:14.078]  Right in that same time frame, copper was discovered in the McCarthy region of Alaska, which attracted the attention then of one of the big globalists operating at that time, the Guggenheim family.
[03:12:14.078 --> 03:12:25.123]  And they came here essentially to develop copper resources while the gold rush moved through Alaska, lasting into really the late 1930s.
[03:12:25.123 --> 03:12:27.184]  And Doctor, just briefly throwing this in.
[03:12:28.248 --> 03:12:38.212]  This is part of the economic sabotage of America that we have this giant area using the false left and fake environmentalists to not let us have access to it as part of the strategic plan.
[03:12:38.212 --> 03:12:38.992]  They admit that.
[03:12:38.992 --> 03:12:40.293]  Please continue.
[03:12:40.293 --> 03:12:41.893]  Yeah, that is exactly correct.
[03:12:41.893 --> 03:12:49.896]  In fact, I want to get into the politics of this because this is a fundamental sort of framework to bring this all into focus.
[03:12:49.896 --> 03:12:57.539]  So coming out of that period, eventually we reached a point in the 1950s where there was a huge push for Stavis.
[03:12:58.389 --> 03:13:04.254]  I was actually born in the territory of Alaska, just prior to statehood.
[03:13:04.254 --> 03:13:08.958]  And when looking at sort of what was happening then, there was a lot of unresolved issues.
[03:13:08.958 --> 03:13:11.500]  The indigenous issue had not been solved.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:13.562]  Land titles had not been solved.
[03:13:13.562 --> 03:13:17.025]  I mean, Alaska was a mess in the late 50s.
[03:13:17.025 --> 03:13:22.389]  At that time, the Congress agreed that Alaska and Hawaii would come in at the same time.
[03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:25.772]  And the reason for that is they wanted to maintain a balance in the U.S.
[03:13:25.772 --> 03:13:25.992]  Senate.
[03:13:26.522 --> 03:13:32.064]  At that time, Hawaii was conservative, and they believed they would elect Republican U.S.
[03:13:32.064 --> 03:13:33.465]  Senators.
[03:13:33.465 --> 03:13:42.669]  Alaska was on the Democratic side, and they knew we would elect Democratic Senators, which is exactly what in fact happened, and we became a state.
[03:13:42.669 --> 03:13:50.973]  From that point forward, and what led to that was the discovery of oil and gas in Cook Inlet, the region I live in today.
[03:13:50.973 --> 03:13:55.815]  What happened then is that the battle began for settling the indigenous issues.
[03:13:56.696 --> 03:14:09.485]  And in trying to settle those indigenous issues here in Alaska, that just was lawsuits, everything was happening, and then they discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay.
[03:14:09.485 --> 03:14:14.729]  The biggest oil discovery in modern history, in terms of the United States.
[03:14:14.729 --> 03:14:22.735]  And that set the stage, because without a clear title to the pipeline corridor, it would never get financed, it would never get built.
[03:14:24.066 --> 03:14:30.636]  And that's the stage that was set for my father's move from the State Senate into the United States Congress.
[03:14:30.636 --> 03:14:33.460]  And that was back in the early 1970s.
[03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:39.789]  My dad was elected to the 92nd Congress, which was in fact the Congress that
[03:14:40.254 --> 03:14:47.040]  settled the Native Land Claims Settlement Act, the biggest settlement for Native peoples in the history of the United States.
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:57.630]  Over 44 million acres and over a billion, just under a billion dollars in cash, which in 1971 was an incredible amount of money.
[03:14:57.630 --> 03:15:06.018]  Now those regional, what they set up is a regional corporation structure with Native villages under it, and they got priority selection
[03:15:06.875 --> 03:15:07.116]  All right.
[03:15:18.610 --> 03:15:30.178]  And this really transferred a tremendous, the biggest private transfer of wealth back to an indigenous population on a new platform of possibilities.
[03:15:30.178 --> 03:15:34.701]  The multinationals really didn't like this idea and hooked into this.
[03:15:34.701 --> 03:15:44.687]  My dad's freshman year in the Congress, he overrode the chairman and setting the stage for what would happen next in the hack up of Alaska's resources.
[03:15:44.687 --> 03:15:45.708]  We're headed for break.
[03:15:45.708 --> 03:15:48.350]  This is Dr. Nick Begich standing in for Alex Jones.

[03:20:18.122 --> 03:20:26.745]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:20:26.745 --> 03:20:28.666]  And welcome back InfoWars.
[03:20:28.666 --> 03:20:34.828]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm standing in for Alex Jones for the last hour of the show today.
[03:20:34.828 --> 03:20:43.011]  And we're talking about natural resources as they relate to the nation and what's happening here in Alaska because it's really so far removed.
[03:20:43.932 --> 03:20:48.195]  from so much of the country that much of what we're doing here is being missed.
[03:20:48.195 --> 03:20:55.281]  And where we left off just before the break was my dad's legislation when he was in the Congress, the Native Land Claims Settlement Act.
[03:20:55.281 --> 03:21:07.551]  Now as a freshman, my dad went around every single congressional office and convinced his colleagues that this was an important issue and one that needed to be resolved in the national interest.
[03:21:07.551 --> 03:21:10.474]  Settling the Native Land Claims allowed for a quarter
[03:21:11.354 --> 03:21:18.978]  To be established for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, one of the significant resource developments in the nation's history.
[03:21:18.978 --> 03:21:22.680]  What also happened is they were going into the resource.
[03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:26.782]  Resources was chaired by Mo Udall, and Mo Udall was opposed.
[03:21:27.462 --> 03:21:30.184]  Actually, to getting this thing through.
[03:21:30.184 --> 03:21:38.050]  And my dad was able to get the committee to override the chairman and get this thing out to the floor to be voted on at a certain point.
[03:21:38.050 --> 03:21:43.774]  But in that compromise, what happened is a section was added called Section D2.
[03:21:43.774 --> 03:21:50.599]  And D2 established parks, preserves, wilderness areas, all this kind of stuff as supposedly
[03:21:51.095 --> 03:21:52.796]  The final deal.
[03:21:52.796 --> 03:22:08.889]  You know, this was going to be the final taking, and yet we've seen, historically since this time, we've continually been picked, our pockets and the nation's pockets picked, the last being Obama in his last attempt to shut down chunks of our state.
[03:22:08.889 --> 03:22:11.111]  Now, why is this important to Alaska?
[03:22:11.111 --> 03:22:18.537]  It's because in the Statehood Act, 1958, when the act passed, it gave Alaska
[03:22:19.193 --> 03:22:24.179]  Ninety percent of the rents and royalties under federal land was to come to this state.
[03:22:24.179 --> 03:22:30.628]  And in exchange for that, we gave up the majority of our land to the federal government.
[03:22:30.628 --> 03:22:33.031]  When the Constitution at the national level says
[03:22:33.502 --> 03:22:40.267]  Military installations, post offices, the basic operations of government, and the rest was to remain with states.
[03:22:40.267 --> 03:22:41.909]  Well, we didn't get that deal.
[03:22:41.909 --> 03:22:48.454]  The deal we got here in Alaska was we wouldn't get the land titles, but we'd get some of the resource value under it.
[03:22:48.454 --> 03:22:59.743]  And then we found out when this was challenged during the time of Ted Stevens and after my father's tenure, they actually challenged this all the way up to the U.S.
[03:22:59.743 --> 03:23:01.464]  Supreme Court when there was an argument
[03:23:01.974 --> 03:23:10.218]  Over opening up Anwar, an area of the North Slope that's been the National Naval Petroleum Reserve since the 1950s.
[03:23:10.218 --> 03:23:22.163]  This has been untapped, known oil and gas reserves that have been locked up on the North Slope of Alaska to the objection of most Alaskans, and if the nation knew, everybody else around here.
[03:23:22.163 --> 03:23:26.865]  Because what this did is they fought for it, they got a little bit of it open,
[03:23:27.543 --> 03:23:30.405]  But the federal government said, oh, we're not going to give you 90%.
[03:23:30.405 --> 03:23:33.267]  We're only going to give you half.
[03:23:33.267 --> 03:23:36.269]  Well, you know, we find out when I went to the U.S.
[03:23:36.269 --> 03:23:40.632]  Supreme Court that you know what a statehood act is worth?
[03:23:40.632 --> 03:23:43.955]  About the same thing as an 1880s Native American treaty.
[03:23:44.585 --> 03:23:49.527]  Because, essentially, the will of Congress can change that act at any time.
[03:23:49.527 --> 03:23:53.149]  It has no validity any more than the next act of Congress.
[03:23:53.149 --> 03:23:59.292]  So we were stripped again of resources intended to go to people that live here.
[03:23:59.292 --> 03:24:02.373]  And we understand how the game is played.
[03:24:02.373 --> 03:24:04.234]  Those are the rules, unfortunately.
[03:24:04.738 --> 03:24:05.078]  I don't know.
[03:24:24.791 --> 03:24:25.993]  And I was one of the last.
[03:24:25.993 --> 03:24:39.188]  In fact, I was the last hard rock miner in a place called Kentishma, Alaska, which is just north of what used to be known as Mount McKinley and is now recognized as Mount Denali in the northern part of what is now the park.
[03:24:40.028 --> 03:24:50.474]  was one of the richest mineral deposits in the history of Alaska, and one of the only known commercially viable projects for an ore called Anemone.
[03:24:50.474 --> 03:24:58.458]  But it also produced lead, silver, anemone, gold, and a number of other metals and rare earth minerals.
[03:24:58.458 --> 03:25:03.220]  This district was completely shut down in 1980.
[03:25:03.220 --> 03:25:06.762]  83 was the last year, that was the last year that I was able to operate out there.
[03:25:07.382 --> 03:25:07.803]  I think?
[03:25:22.995 --> 03:25:25.557]  Spurring one of the longest bankruptcies in U.S.
[03:25:25.557 --> 03:25:33.422]  history, 22 years by the owners of the Gold King mine in Glen Creek of Kantishna.
[03:25:33.422 --> 03:25:36.804]  But all of this, then again, what was really going on?
[03:25:36.804 --> 03:25:44.289]  You know, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, fueled this environmental push to lock up these lands.
[03:25:44.289 --> 03:25:48.151]  And everyone was going, gee, you know, the industrialists have changed their minds.
[03:25:48.151 --> 03:25:48.952]  No, they didn't.
[03:25:49.856 --> 03:25:55.500]  All of that public land was open for mineral location by any American citizen.
[03:25:55.500 --> 03:26:11.651]  Anyone listening to this broadcast that resides as a citizen of the United States could come up here, make a discovery, and stake that land and lay claim to it under the mining acts of the late 1800s and moving into this last century.
[03:26:11.651 --> 03:26:17.715]  This was the law of the land, but by locking it up in parks and preserves, they essentially said,
[03:26:18.490 --> 03:26:46.310]  No, this is a safety deposit box of multinationals because I can tell you when the rest of the world throws the countries, our country, out in terms of producing or in the case of rare earth minerals, which we'll get into after the next break, these are strategic right now and this has become the safety deposit box for multinationals and how they operate in Alaska because what will eventually occur is there will be a national emergency
[03:26:47.010 --> 03:27:05.323]  They will suspend the environmental regulations in these parks and preserves, and they will invite the biggest companies in the world to bid, because they'll be on the quick speed, save the nation calendar, and all these guys will be brought in to exploit what the small miner once owned in this state was taken from them.
[03:27:05.323 --> 03:27:08.826]  This is a repeat formula around the world.
[03:27:08.826 --> 03:27:15.651]  Lock it up, set it aside, and then go exploit the markets that are a little easier, the ones that are already so corrupted.
[03:27:16.112 --> 03:27:21.295]  That you can go and exploit the resources for nothing until those countries throw them out.
[03:27:21.295 --> 03:27:26.437]  And then you have the safety deposit box set up and buried in the native land claims.
[03:27:26.437 --> 03:27:44.146]  And later the D2 legislation of the early 19, or actually the 1976 going into 1980, which came out of the Carter administration, which was part of this same scheme to lock up the nation's resources in favor of multinational companies at some future date.
[03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:52.374]  Now we have a different president, a different way of going at the resources, and what resources we hold in common.
[03:27:52.374 --> 03:27:56.236]  Most people do not know that the treasury of the nation is here.
[03:27:56.236 --> 03:28:03.439]  We have enough natural resources in Alaska, if we were developing them, to retire the national debt.
[03:28:03.439 --> 03:28:08.222]  Not on the backs of the American taxpayer, but by looking at the balance sheet.
[03:28:08.222 --> 03:28:13.925]  The resources that we hold in common, that are not being developed, that are being sidestepped
[03:28:14.850 --> 03:28:29.490]  In favor of strategies that are not national strategies, but are strategies for multinational companies looking to steal the resources, as has been the history in Alaska for over a hundred years, going back even further to the time of the Russians.
[03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:31.652]  This is the time.
[03:28:31.652 --> 03:28:35.415]  We need a railroad, a transportation system that will support it.
[03:28:35.415 --> 03:28:43.242]  And after the break, I want to get into some of the railroads and some of the impedances to progress that would bring minerals back into the Midwest.
[03:28:43.242 --> 03:28:47.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and standing in for Alex today.
[03:28:47.026 --> 03:28:49.368]  I'm Dr. Nick Begich, broadcasting from Alaska.

[03:29:23.388 --> 03:29:25.168]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:34:18.138 --> 03:34:21.420]  We're sitting in the best economy ever.

[03:34:37.558 --> 03:34:41.484]  The face of the country with InfoWars.com.
[03:34:41.484 --> 03:34:45.109]  Support Alex in every way that you can.
[03:34:45.109 --> 03:34:47.572]  Getting back into the meat of the story.
[03:34:47.572 --> 03:34:51.738]  Okay, so D2, this section of law finally in the Carter administration.
[03:34:53.183 --> 03:34:53.323]  Yes.
[03:35:14.740 --> 03:35:17.481]  Uh, National Park sits on the Canadian border.
[03:35:17.481 --> 03:35:19.702]  Uh, in the middle of that, I have an inhold.
[03:35:19.702 --> 03:35:25.483]  And it's a minerals inholding that was originally staked in 1898 and subsequently patented.
[03:35:25.483 --> 03:35:30.565]  So I own a surface estate of mineral rights, water rights, all the rights that run with that land.
[03:35:31.105 --> 03:35:35.466]  Now, when you look at where that's situated, it's in the Kennecott Mineral Belt.
[03:35:35.466 --> 03:35:41.607]  Many people know the name Kennecott as one of the biggest copper producers in the world.
[03:35:41.607 --> 03:35:46.768]  Kennecott started in Alaska as a Guggenheim project.
[03:35:46.768 --> 03:35:50.729]  The Guggenheims originally came to the United States from Europe.
[03:35:50.729 --> 03:35:53.070]  They were originally in New York.
[03:35:53.070 --> 03:35:54.230]  They sold something called
[03:35:55.210 --> 03:35:58.193]  A black polish that they used on stovepipes.
[03:35:58.193 --> 03:36:01.797]  You think about stovepipes from wood stoves back in those days.
[03:36:01.797 --> 03:36:14.530]  They later invested in lead and silver and copper deposits in Colorado, made their fortune there, and came to Alaska and bought what turned into the richest copper mine ever.
[03:36:17.552 --> 03:36:24.177]  In fact, they built the railroad before the railroad ever reached this deposit.
[03:36:24.177 --> 03:36:28.921]  They had enough ore stockpile where the first train loadout paid for the program.
[03:36:28.921 --> 03:36:30.081]  It was unbelievable.
[03:36:30.081 --> 03:36:31.963]  It went on to be developed.
[03:36:31.963 --> 03:36:34.905]  Eventually, the Guggenheims left Alaska.
[03:36:34.905 --> 03:36:38.608]  We had not very many people living here, no labor force, and they discovered
[03:36:39.168 --> 03:36:39.268]  Yes.
[03:36:54.984 --> 03:36:58.865]  Many of the rare earths are found there and boulders of cobalt.
[03:36:58.865 --> 03:37:01.826]  Cobalt right now is $40 a pound.
[03:37:01.826 --> 03:37:07.107]  Boulders the size of cars laying on the ground was not uncommon.
[03:37:07.107 --> 03:37:16.910]  We found not only at the turn of the century in the 1800s but also as late as the 1980s and 90s when this land was being locked up.
[03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:20.051]  So new discoveries are not allowed there.
[03:37:20.051 --> 03:37:22.052]  New staking is not allowed there.
[03:37:22.052 --> 03:37:30.857]  Most of the historic properties have been acquired by the park as they choked off the possibilities of economic development in many of these areas.
[03:37:30.857 --> 03:37:37.180]  But again, what happened here were fights over natural resources behind the small miner.
[03:37:37.180 --> 03:37:41.182]  The kind of guys you see on these TV programs they have on the air now.
[03:37:41.182 --> 03:37:42.823]  There were hundreds of miners.
[03:37:42.823 --> 03:37:45.224]  I was growing up in the last era
[03:37:45.908 --> 03:37:54.932]  of the small miner, where a person with the backbone to get up and walk into the wilderness still had a chance to make a valuable discovery and do something with it.
[03:37:54.932 --> 03:37:56.233]  And that still exists today.
[03:37:56.233 --> 03:38:07.017]  I mean, if you have the courage of it and the strength, the character to do it, there are federal lands and state lands where you can still are open to mineral location within our region.
[03:38:07.017 --> 03:38:09.799]  But let's talk about what's been discovered here.
[03:38:09.799 --> 03:38:12.960]  In Southeast Alaska, Hekla mining
[03:38:13.777 --> 03:38:14.017]  I don't
[03:38:32.455 --> 03:38:35.056]  project that's been operating for decades.
[03:38:35.056 --> 03:38:41.598]  If you take a look near Nome, Alaska, this is closer to the Russian side of our world.
[03:38:41.598 --> 03:38:51.201]  If you look up at Nome, Alaska, you'll see an area and the mine run by Techcominco called Red Dog.
[03:38:51.201 --> 03:38:55.562]  Now, Red Dog is a lead zinc mine, primarily zinc.
[03:38:55.562 --> 03:38:57.203]  It's responsible for providing 6%
[03:38:59.063 --> 03:39:01.906]  Of the zinc concentrates in the world.
[03:39:01.906 --> 03:39:14.139]  And this port that they built to facilitate Red Dog is a port that you can't even use six months a year because the ocean is frozen, literally frozen.
[03:39:14.139 --> 03:39:15.340]  But they still produce 6%.
[03:39:17.296 --> 03:39:21.401]  In the half a year shipping season of the World's Inc.
[03:39:21.401 --> 03:39:34.075]  Now surrounding that area, and if you look at the holdings of Techcominco in the area, a major portion of that flows through the native corporation, going back to the native land claims that my dad enacted.
[03:39:34.075 --> 03:39:37.860]  In fact, $74 million of their last year's revenue
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:38.801]  We're good to go.
[03:39:57.056 --> 03:40:03.220]  And with that, it just doesn't support that one indigenous group and the people of the state of Alaska.
[03:40:03.220 --> 03:40:07.422]  This place generates federal taxes that also flow through.
[03:40:07.422 --> 03:40:18.109]  Now there's some things in the federal tax code we don't have time to get into today in a future broadcast, and I'm going to be standing in again next Friday on the same hour for Alex.
[03:40:18.109 --> 03:40:20.150]  We'll get into some of the tax consequences.
[03:40:20.831 --> 03:40:20.871]  No.
[03:40:38.795 --> 03:40:41.519]  There are no roads in Alaska.
[03:40:41.519 --> 03:40:50.012]  There's very limited railroads in Alaska, and as a consequence, we literally cannot get anywhere.
[03:40:50.012 --> 03:40:51.475]  And here's the situation that
[03:40:52.619 --> 03:40:58.660]  That has happened in our neighbor to the south, Canada and British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.
[03:40:58.660 --> 03:41:05.982]  What they have done is gradually punch the railroad further and further north as their developmental footprint has moved north.
[03:41:05.982 --> 03:41:15.784]  If you look environmentally on how they balance both the development of the northern regions of British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, you will see a harmonic
[03:41:16.364 --> 03:41:28.611]  Balance between the environment, fish and game resources, the indigenous populations that weigh in on these issues in a meaningful way in Canada, and you see the railroad moving north.
[03:41:28.611 --> 03:41:38.677]  We need that railroad to connect with the existing Alaska Railroad to move resources, riches, railroads to riches is what this nation needs.
[03:41:38.677 --> 03:41:41.179]  To move those resources out of Alaska,
[03:41:41.710 --> 03:41:46.013]  through Canada into the industrial rust belt of the United States.
[03:41:46.013 --> 03:41:52.018]  What you see on the map in front of you is the pipeline corridor, which is a road straight to the North Slope.
[03:41:52.018 --> 03:41:55.500]  And that's the end of the road and railroad matrix coming out of Alaska.
[03:41:55.500 --> 03:42:02.385]  And if you look at Western Alaska, empty space, a treasure house that you can't even reach.
[03:42:02.385 --> 03:42:03.406]  One of the big minds
[03:42:03.948 --> 03:42:09.851]  Going in that's in its advanced state of programming will be in one of those big empty spaces.
[03:42:09.851 --> 03:42:11.592]  It's called the Donlan Mine.
[03:42:11.592 --> 03:42:28.380]  It's going to be a five and a half billion dollar private sector investment which will include a 350 mile railroad and gas pipeline from the Cook Inlet headed into interior Alaska to open up what will become one of the biggest gold mines owned both by
[03:42:29.159 --> 03:42:35.263]  Private companies and native organizations that are developing these resources in the nation's interests.
[03:42:35.263 --> 03:42:36.364]  Think about this.
[03:42:36.364 --> 03:42:50.072]  After the break, we're going to get back into the resource issues and the robbery of the country and how to get that wealth moved into jobs and into building an industry at a time when we are seeing America become great again.
[03:42:50.072 --> 03:42:52.974]  Our resource, our treasuries, are on our fingertips.
[03:42:53.434 --> 03:42:57.379]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.379 --> 03:43:00.682]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.682 --> 03:43:06.949]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.949 --> 03:43:09.732]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.453 --> 03:43:14.254]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.254 --> 03:43:20.736]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.736 --> 03:43:25.698]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.451 --> 03:43:30.373]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.373 --> 03:43:37.578]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.578 --> 03:43:42.281]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.281 --> 03:43:48.484]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.484 --> 03:43:52.467]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

[03:45:58.050 --> 03:46:03.772]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.772 --> 03:46:11.656]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.656 --> 03:46:14.797]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:14.977 --> 03:46:20.281]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:46:20.281 --> 03:46:23.043]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:23.043 --> 03:46:32.010]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:32.190 --> 03:46:33.570]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.954 --> 03:47:17.855]  Welcome back.
[03:47:17.855 --> 03:47:22.919]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and this is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:47:22.919 --> 03:47:24.180]  I'm standing in for Alex today.
[03:47:24.180 --> 03:47:28.763]  We're talking about mineral issues in Alaska, why it's important for the nation.
[03:47:28.763 --> 03:47:32.106]  Again, I want to go back to a couple of points I mentioned earlier.
[03:47:32.106 --> 03:47:36.029]  18% of the land in the United States is in Alaska.
[03:47:36.029 --> 03:47:42.074]  We have about 750,000 people that live here scattered across all that land.
[03:47:42.074 --> 03:47:43.655]  We have a bigger coastline than
[03:47:49.474 --> 03:47:57.626]  This area as a treasury and we covered last segment a little bit about sort of the choke points in terms of transporting things out.
[03:47:57.626 --> 03:48:03.414]  When we left on to the break, I was talking about the Donlan mine, which is a gold prospect.
[03:48:03.414 --> 03:48:05.898]  It's going to be a five and a half billion dollar investment.
[03:48:07.039 --> 03:48:13.544]  A 350-mile pipeline, gas pipeline, from Cook Inlet with a parallel road alongside of it.
[03:48:13.544 --> 03:48:24.813]  And all of the villages currently fueled by diesel will have access for the first time to economic, valuable energy resources produced in our region of the state.
[03:48:24.813 --> 03:48:29.557]  Now Donlan Creek, as a mine, has a tremendous need for energy.
[03:48:29.557 --> 03:48:31.098]  It's going to require 125 megawatts
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:34.520]  I think?
[03:48:52.791 --> 03:48:53.091]  Yes, we are.
[03:49:08.147 --> 03:49:08.488]  Thank you.
[03:49:24.884 --> 03:49:35.574]  Our trespass, where people come in and exploit their resources without permission, and I can tell you Native Americans in Alaska and the rest of the nation are a little bit tired of that.
[03:49:35.574 --> 03:49:38.877]  We have settlements that need to be honored and respected.
[03:49:38.877 --> 03:49:41.840]  And roads are not the right answer for Alaska.
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:42.521]  Railroads.
[03:49:43.161 --> 03:49:47.124]  That's how you develop things and you also control those quarters.
[03:49:47.124 --> 03:49:52.908]  So you don't have every Winnebago trespassing on private land, but rail bringing people through.
[03:49:52.908 --> 03:49:55.830]  People say, well, rail is so much more expensive.
[03:49:55.830 --> 03:50:06.597]  Yeah, but railroads people at least offset some of that public expense by paying fees for riding and moving across those rail lines.
[03:50:06.597 --> 03:50:09.379]  Now the rail system here used to be owned by the federal government.
[03:50:09.379 --> 03:50:11.980]  They actually turned it over to the state of Alaska.
[03:50:11.980 --> 03:50:12.501]  We own the
[03:50:13.041 --> 03:50:23.976]  Railroad that is here now and the quarters but to expand that as the underlying infrastructure as in the national interest today should be a national issue.
[03:50:23.976 --> 03:50:28.282]  We should be bringing that railroad into these areas that have the minerals potential.
[03:50:28.702 --> 03:50:46.180]  And then linking it with the Canadian rail system, we can begin to move these resources directly into the rust belt of the nation and reactivate these refineries, the mills, the production, the industrial capacity with not imported natural resources, but with our own.
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:47.140]  I think?
[03:51:02.672 --> 03:51:28.722]  timber and natural resources most of which are headed into China and Asia and if you look again on the map of the of the world you know the closest places when you look at transport routes moving to the Pacific and then as the Arctic opens up because the fact is climate is changing it's not going to change any any differently the other way if models are correct
[03:51:29.082 --> 03:51:42.346]  We will have ice-free ports on the north slope of Alaska for a large portion of the year, allowing us to ship resources from Alaska directly over the poles into the European markets as well.
[03:51:42.346 --> 03:51:45.426]  So Alaska sits at the crossroads of the world.
[03:51:45.426 --> 03:51:49.407]  And you know the two biggest air freight carriers in the world realized it?
[03:51:49.407 --> 03:51:50.148]  Did you?
[03:51:50.148 --> 03:51:51.228]  And most people don't know this.
[03:51:52.003 --> 03:51:57.927]  Fairbanks, Alaska is the international air hub for UPS.
[03:51:57.927 --> 03:52:03.731]  Now, when you look at Anchorage, it is the international air hub for Federal Express.
[03:52:04.349 --> 03:52:25.215]  Anchorage Airport, International Airport, is one of the busiest cargo ports in the world, because if you put Alaska on the top of the globe, and then look at the populations of Asia and Europe surrounding us, we're in the ideal place for equal transport distances to all the key markets on the planet, except our own!
[03:52:25.815 --> 03:52:36.339]  We need a railroad to take us into the Midwest, to take us into the Rust Belt, to change the dimension of what we can do with our own raw resources.
[03:52:36.339 --> 03:52:47.703]  We need a gas line that moves from the North Slope of Alaska to Tidewater to bring liquefied natural gas products over into Asia, into the West Coast of the United States.
[03:52:48.383 --> 03:52:52.226]  The fuel of the future is going to be natural gas.
[03:52:52.226 --> 03:52:53.868]  It's the transitional fuel.
[03:52:53.868 --> 03:53:03.936]  We have huge, huge, trillions and trillions and trillions with a T cubic feet of natural gas on the North Slope of Alaska.
[03:53:03.936 --> 03:53:07.599]  The pipeline itself is running at one quarter of its capacity.
[03:53:08.047 --> 03:53:11.791]  And yet we have oil fields coming online that will bring that up.
[03:53:11.791 --> 03:53:22.522]  And I predict, and you heard it here, within five years you're going to see that pipeline double its productive capacity based on what's been discovered in the last five years on the North Slope.
[03:53:22.522 --> 03:53:27.207]  We need progressive, aggressive view of developing resources.
[03:53:27.207 --> 03:53:28.489]  Alaska has the tightest
[03:53:28.949 --> 03:53:35.753]  Restrictions in terms of environmental safeguards at the state and certainly then at the national level.
[03:53:35.753 --> 03:53:39.615]  My younger brother, Tom, is in the state Senate here.
[03:53:39.615 --> 03:53:43.297]  I can tell you he's on the total liberal side of the equation.
[03:53:43.297 --> 03:53:45.438]  We're so opposite on so many levels.
[03:53:45.438 --> 03:53:49.160]  But when it comes to developmental issues, this is a place
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:53.724]  Where Democrats and Republicans, at least in my state, come together.
[03:53:53.724 --> 03:53:55.465]  Because it is so important.
[03:53:55.465 --> 03:54:00.409]  And on the screen now is the Donlan mine and the environmental studies from that.
[03:54:00.409 --> 03:54:07.755]  You know, this is going to transfer again huge wealth into the state to the native corporations that gets redistributed, you know, 30%.
[03:54:09.256 --> 03:54:31.400]  Of the resources that minerals develop and oil and gas develops for natives stays with that native group and the rest is spread, the other 70% over the native organizations across the state to sort of balance, it was part of the native land claim settlement, to balance the value of wealth where one group maybe had a huge advantage over some other group.
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:37.821]  Well this gave a way to distribute it fairly among the original populations of Alaska.
[03:54:38.661 --> 03:54:42.308]  And most people don't even consider the native populations here.
[03:54:42.308 --> 03:54:47.417]  Do you know in the United States there's 458 native recognized domestic tribal nations?
[03:54:47.417 --> 03:54:48.058]  How?
[03:54:52.688 --> 03:54:54.069]  are in Alaska.
[03:54:54.069 --> 03:55:00.533]  Half of the tribal nations are in my state, and yet most Americans don't have a clue.
[03:55:00.533 --> 03:55:02.755]  And these weren't people that we warred against.
[03:55:02.755 --> 03:55:04.316]  These are people who weren't conquered.
[03:55:04.316 --> 03:55:16.905]  In most cases, there weren't even forts developed to lay claim to these regions, which is why we've had such disputes over the issue of Native sovereignty and Native issues in Alaska.
[03:55:16.905 --> 03:55:18.526]  I've been in the middle of that.
[03:55:18.526 --> 03:55:19.766]  I'm the second generation.
[03:55:19.766 --> 03:55:21.708]  My son will be the third generation of this.
[03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:26.452]  And these are important issues the nation should know about.
[03:55:26.452 --> 03:55:44.207]  We have such opportunity knocking at the door if we would just recognize, you know, the same kind of energy that went into building the Transcontinental Railroad needs to happen to hit the last frontier area of our country.
[03:55:44.207 --> 03:55:46.809]  And there are incredible parks and preserves.
[03:55:46.809 --> 03:55:47.610]  That has already been
[03:55:48.010 --> 03:55:55.816]  Taken into consideration, it does not need to be anymore, and it's a violation of the nation to lock any more up.
[03:55:55.816 --> 03:55:58.858]  Now is the time to work together.
[03:55:58.858 --> 03:56:09.265]  You know, the native corporations that my dad helped form back in 1971, they got a billion dollars in taxpayer money at that time as part of the settlement.
[03:56:09.645 --> 03:56:18.954]  And you know that several of those corporations today generate several billion dollars a year in domestic revenue.
[03:56:18.954 --> 03:56:24.339]  I mean, this is fantastic transfer that in large part did work.
[03:56:24.339 --> 03:56:27.723]  There's still some problems and today's not the day to get into them.
[03:56:28.613 --> 03:56:29.174]  We will.
[03:56:29.174 --> 03:56:31.895]  I've worked as a tribal administrator in this state.
[03:56:31.895 --> 03:56:35.638]  I've worked for native corporations and tribal governments here.
[03:56:35.638 --> 03:56:45.445]  I've got a personal history in that that at a future show we'll explore together to talk about how that plays in to making America great again.
[03:56:45.445 --> 03:56:49.548]  Because Alaska should be a key part of that in terms of opportunity.
[03:56:49.548 --> 03:56:52.030]  When you think about our trade imbalance with China,
[03:56:52.450 --> 03:56:55.354]  Right now China's talking to the Trump administration.
[03:56:55.354 --> 03:57:07.769]  One of the things that's on the agenda through the Trump administration is the idea of building a gas line here so we can start exporting natural gas and getting the Chinese to underwrite it and be that market.
[03:57:08.369 --> 03:57:13.050]  We have an opportunity to start sending things the other direction.
[03:57:13.050 --> 03:57:15.931]  And I think we have the right administration to see Alaska open.
[03:57:15.931 --> 03:57:17.391]  We're headed into the break.
[03:57:17.391 --> 03:57:18.691]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:57:18.691 --> 03:57:20.952]  I'm sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:57:20.952 --> 03:57:23.532]  This is InfoWars.com.
[03:57:23.532 --> 03:57:24.973]  Come on back after the break.
[03:57:24.973 --> 03:57:31.614]  We'll finish up talking about Alaska minerals industry and what's happening and the robbing of our nation's wealth.
[03:57:43.311 --> 03:57:50.955]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:57:50.955 --> 03:57:58.859]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:57:58.859 --> 03:58:01.961]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:58:02.581 --> 03:58:07.225]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:58:07.225 --> 03:58:11.368]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:58:11.368 --> 03:58:14.511]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[03:58:14.511 --> 03:58:19.274]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:58:19.274 --> 03:58:22.337]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:58:22.737 --> 03:58:37.811]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[03:58:37.811 --> 03:58:39.352]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:58:39.352 --> 03:58:41.374]  We will prevail if you take action and I know
[03:58:44.585 --> 03:58:50.189]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[03:58:50.189 --> 03:58:51.049]  It'd take hours.
[03:58:51.049 --> 03:58:53.491]  MycoZX Plus, it now has a lower price.
[03:58:53.491 --> 03:58:54.672]  It's stronger.
[03:58:54.672 --> 03:58:56.273]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:56.273 --> 03:58:59.495]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
