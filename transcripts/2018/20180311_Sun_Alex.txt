[00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.162]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:19.044]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:28.669]  Welcome on this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.150]  I'm David Knight, your host for today.
[00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.553]  It's kind of interesting, a story that we have on InfoWars.
[00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.073]  It's not something that we
[00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:38.703]  That we're unaccustomed to.
[00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.164]  The fact that you have people attacking free speech.
[00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.264]  We see them doing this in every way possible.
[00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.045]  We had Jake Lloyd go out and do a report.
[00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.685]  They grabbed the microphone out of his hand.
[00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:56.448]  They've done that to us at Planned Parenthood protests where we're talking about the genocide of Planned Parenthood.
[00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:58.229]  This is the left's tactic.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.870]  As we were there holding up signs of little babies and saying black lives do matter and this has been planned as a genocide from the very beginning.
[00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.615]  They showed up to put black signs in front of our signs.
[00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:11.356]  They had nothing to say.
[00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:12.618]  They just didn't want us to say anything.
[00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:14.541]  Of course you see it all the time on social media.
[00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:19.007]  I just had somebody troll me on something and they didn't like what I had to say.
[00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:22.071]  So they said somebody needs to take away David Knight's Twitter account.
[00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:23.633]  They need to take the keyboard out of his hand.
[00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.098]  I retweeted it and I said, well, you know, this is the typical response from the left.
[00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:27.979]  They don't want to debate you.
[00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:28.820]  They want to censor you.
[00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.951]  But of course it's going to get more violent.
[00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:43.498]  And what we're seeing in the UK is Tommy Robinson just walking down the street, being singled out by 10 individuals with balaclavas on their head, covering up their face so nobody can see them, attacking him.
[00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:46.940]  And we have the clip at Infowars.com.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.982]  I want to play you a little bit of this clip, just give you an idea of what's going on.
[00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.683]  It's about a 20-minute clip, so we're not going to play it.
[00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.805]  And there's a lot of visual stuff here, so it's not appropriate for the radio.
[00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:56.966]  But let's play a little bit of that clip.
[00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:59.247]  So you get a taste of what that is.
[00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:00.868]  This is the way the left reacts to people.
[00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:03.189]  The way they bully and target.
[00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.271]  I guess we could even say bully and harass people.
[00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:09.353]  Wear a shoe tube to protect Tommy Robinson.
[00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.214]  They're not going to be there.
[00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:11.054]  Here's a little bit of that clip.
[00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:17.638]  Alright, these are guys with masks on.
[00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:21.521]  Attacking a woman who is filming them.
[00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.042]  Ten of them coming after Tommy Robinson.
[00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:26.704]  Trying to take the camera away from her.
[00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:33.159]  Coming at him from the back.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.161]  Attacking him, knocking him down from the back.
[00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:36.941]  Jumping on him.
[00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.542]  But he gets up, starts fighting him.
[00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:40.143]  And he basically fights him off.
[00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:45.608]  Uh, spoiler alert here, but he basically fights them off and then talks about it to other people.
[00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:49.730]  And the amazing thing about this clip to me... Right here.
[00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.551]  He's talking to the police.
[00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.753]  Yeah, he walks down to the police and said, your friends ran away.
[00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:07.719]  And how did they do for 10 of them?
[00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.320]  How did they do?
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.200]  How did they do?
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.741]  How did they do?
[00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:16.763]  You're not on camera, you're not on camera.
[00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:18.784]  He's asking some people there, how did they do?
[00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:27.267]  He had to fight off 10 people who were teaming up, attacking him from every angle because the police would not do anything.
[00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:31.969]  As he pointed out to the police, he said, your friends, your mates ran away.
[00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:47.118]  You can see the rest of that report at Infowars.
[00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:49.039]  It's pretty amazing to me.
[00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:56.360]  But this is the tactic to the left, and this is the tactic of the police, who basically will not do anything.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.540]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.941]  They see a fight like that, they don't want to get in the middle of it, they just run away.
[00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.175]  We can expect that.
[00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:11.998]  And as we are going to talk in the show, we've now had the Florida governor sign a massive gun control bill.
[00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:15.619]  It's a $400 million gun control bill.
[00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.239]  There you go.
[00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.519]  Big spending Republican.
[00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.680]  Anti-self-protection Republican.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.321]  $400 million gun control bill from the Republican governor there, Rick Scott.
[00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:30.283]  Because, you know, you can't protect anybody unless you've got a uniform, right?
[00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:39.572]  Uh, we saw a lot of that, didn't we, at the, uh, uh, Stoneman Douglas School that began all of this gun control movement in Florida.
[00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:49.439]  Uh, the people with uniforms did basically the same thing there that the police in uniform did when you had Tommy Robinson surrounded and attacked by ten individuals.
[00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.420]  They protect themselves.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.461]  They walk away.
[00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.962]  See, sometimes it doesn't require a uniform to be a hero.
[00:04:56.002 --> 00:05:00.212]  You can be a hero and wear a uniform, but you can also be a hero without a uniform.
[00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:00.853]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:01.374]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:01.895]  I'm David Knight.
[00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:07.879]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:12.623]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:05:12.943 --> 00:05:21.289]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.892]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:30.096]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.218]  Floralife supports your body's core.
[00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:37.340]  Where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.282]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:45.944]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:54.088]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:58.310]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.911]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:09.284]  News.
[00:06:09.845 --> 00:06:10.665]  Analysis.
[00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:11.846]  Reports.
[00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.727]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:18.309]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:25.894]  Welcome to this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:25.934 --> 00:06:27.015]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:34.480]  I just played, at the top of the hour, a video of Tommy Robinson being attacked by an anti-fog gang of ten guys wearing masks.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.802]  Of course, they're ashamed of what they do, and they should be ashamed.
[00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:38.803]  Bunch of cowards.
[00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:40.924]  Ten people attacking one individual, but he fought them off.
[00:06:41.946 --> 00:06:43.227]  A very compelling video.
[00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:44.869]  It's about 20 minutes long.
[00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:50.193]  I played a clip of it at the top of the hour when we didn't have our radio stations joining us.
[00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:52.935]  If you want to see that, you can see that at Infowars.com.
[00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.997]  Tommy Robinson attacked by anti-fog gang.
[00:06:56.017 --> 00:07:00.461]  And it's important to understand what the tactics of the left are.
[00:07:01.282 --> 00:07:05.065]  And you can see it in that clip very easily.
[00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:11.070]  And of course, afterwards, he walked over to a large group of police officers not far away who were just standing there doing nothing.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.761]  And he said, uh, hey, why didn't you guys help me?
[00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.862]  Oh, nothing to worry about, fella, you know, and all this.
[00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:21.403]  And he says, uh, your mates, your friends, ran away when they saw this.
[00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:30.205]  Kind of like what we have seen with the cowards of Broward County, the sheriff's officers who would not go in.
[00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:31.686]  That wasn't the case with the police department.
[00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:33.226]  That was the case with the sheriff's department.
[00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.047]  See, just because you wear a uniform,
[00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:36.997]  Doesn't mean that you're a hero.
[00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:38.898]  Doesn't mean that you'll protect other people.
[00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.519]  Doesn't mean that you'll put your life on the line.
[00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:42.600]  Certainly the police department did.
[00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:44.602]  Not the county sheriff's office.
[00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:47.323]  And so you have different rules on different people.
[00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:51.466]  And the very fact that somebody is wearing a uniform doesn't make them a hero.
[00:07:52.387 --> 00:07:54.388]  You don't have to have a uniform to be a hero.
[00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:57.990]  We saw that in the Sutherland Springs church shooting.
[00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:04.014]  The guy who was the hero there had the gun that the left hates so badly.
[00:08:04.374 --> 00:08:04.715]  The AR-15.
[00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:07.084]  Which they want to ban.
[00:08:07.124 --> 00:08:09.706]  That's got to be purged from the earth.
[00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:11.448]  We're going to wish that away into the cornfield.
[00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:12.589]  Never again.
[00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.250]  Never again, they say.
[00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.994]  Never again is the most naive thing I have ever heard anybody say.
[00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:19.415]  You can't say that about anything.
[00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:21.457]  Certainly can't say that about conflicts.
[00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:28.143]  We heard that after World War I. Maybe these high school students didn't get that in history.
[00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:30.145]  You know that war to end all wars?
[00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:32.587]  Well, it didn't actually do that, did it?
[00:08:33.773 --> 00:08:39.055]  You're never going to find a situation where we're going to change the nature of man.
[00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:42.196]  That's basically what they need to understand, is in the nature of man.
[00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:49.579]  So the best we can do is make sure that good people that have been vetted, that are trained, are able to protect other people.
[00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:50.939]  But that's not what they're doing in Florida.
[00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.960]  We're going to get into gun control and how Florida has responded.
[00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:59.002]  The Republican governor acting like you would expect Hillary Clinton to act.
[00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:03.897]  Spending 400 million dollars, creating a new gun control bill.
[00:09:04.738 --> 00:09:09.863]  So here we have big spending, anti-Second Amendment, Republican Rhino.
[00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.404]  Let's see, did I miss anything?
[00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:19.712]  Let's see, big spending, anti-Second Amendment, anti-self-protection, Republican, quote-unquote Republican, in name only.
[00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:20.773]  Rick Scott.
[00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.991]  And immediately the NRA has filed suit.
[00:09:24.532 --> 00:09:25.432]  So I want to tell you about that.
[00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:31.196]  I want to give you an example of why Rick Scott is wrong in siding with the Democrats in this.
[00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:33.337]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:35.259]  We're also going to talk about Trumponomics.
[00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:44.765]  We're going to talk about the victory lap that he was taking in Pennsylvania as he's taking the stump trying to help a Republican in a congressional race that's coming up there in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:49.112]  This is a very wise move politically, but it's the right thing to do.
[00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:51.496]  It's what President Trump campaigned on.
[00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:58.407]  And I think we're going to look back at this and we're going to talk about, instead of Reaganomics, we're going to talk about Trumponomics.
[00:09:58.968 --> 00:10:01.809]  And I think Trumponomics looks better than Reaganomics.
[00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:13.918]  Because it's not only a large tax cut, but it's also large cuts in regulation, as well as economic nationalism, which was never a part of the Reagan recovery.
[00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:18.281]  So we're looking at something here that is far bigger than anything Ronald Reagan ever did.
[00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:26.931]  Now he's making the same mistake on economics that Ronald Reagan did in terms of not cutting spending because the deficit is still continuing to go up.
[00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.051]  I don't know.
[00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:51.612]  Three-hour shows typically do.
[00:10:51.832 --> 00:10:56.673]  Typically you can find me in a three-hour show every morning 8 to 11 here at InfoWars.
[00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:02.194]  But today we have a two-hour show and in the second hour we're going to be talking to Christian Saussure.
[00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:11.816]  He is the sailor who many of us were so upset about the fact that he was sent to jail for doing something that really wasn't a serious crime.
[00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:13.977]  As his defense attorney pointed out,
[00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:17.411]  This should have been taken care of with probation.
[00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:20.572]  It should have been taken care of by the military.
[00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:23.234]  There could have been some discipline for what he did.
[00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:26.156]  What he did was he took some pictures of where he had served.
[00:11:27.117 --> 00:11:30.719]  It was the lowest possible level of classification.
[00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:31.980]  Confidential.
[00:11:33.348 --> 00:11:36.050]  And they basically hung him out to dry.
[00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:55.222]  This was a very vindictive move by the Obama administration, especially when you look at the FBI involvement and the involvement of the FBI director saying that even though Hillary Clinton had violated national security blatantly and continually at the highest level, I mean this is, you got three basic levels of classification.
[00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:57.883]  Confidential secret and top secret.
[00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:02.767]  It doesn't take much of anything to have something classified as confidential.
[00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:06.850]  As a matter of fact, our government wants to classify everything as secret.
[00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.652]  Remember the memo that came from the Republicans?
[00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:12.314]  Remember when they declassified that?
[00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:18.858]  There was all this back and forth and the FBI was saying and other people in the Justice Department and the Democrats.
[00:12:19.218 --> 00:12:20.920]  You can't show that to anybody, President Trump.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.441]  That's classified.
[00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.139]  And he says it doesn't give away anything important.
[00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:26.540]  It doesn't give away any methods.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.900]  It doesn't expose any personnel.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.861]  There's no reason for this to even be classified.
[00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.141]  They had it classified top secret.
[00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:37.122]  And yet this poor sailor was raked over the coals.
[00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:40.623]  He basically had been sent to prison for a year.
[00:12:41.503 --> 00:12:44.124]  They had him still under house arrest and on parole.
[00:12:44.844 --> 00:12:49.265]  And being a convicted felon was destroying his life.
[00:12:49.905 --> 00:12:50.625]  He couldn't get a job.
[00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:53.840]  And President Trump took that away.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.681]  So we're going to talk to him.
[00:12:55.281 --> 00:13:01.346]  This is something that Trump tweeted about yesterday, Saturday, that he finally took this away.
[00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:03.127]  He had already served a year in time.
[00:13:03.927 --> 00:13:08.951]  This is just taking away the stigma that was going to follow him throughout life.
[00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:11.273]  And it's a great thing that President Trump did that.
[00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:13.411]  All right, let's take a look at some of the news here.
[00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:19.793]  We have, besides gun control in Florida, they want to exercise a little bit more control over the sunshine in the Sunshine State.
[00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:23.454]  They're now saying that they would like to adopt year-round daylight savings time.
[00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:26.734]  I think that would be a good idea.
[00:13:26.794 --> 00:13:31.655]  I mean, I really don't like the fact that they mess with the clock twice a year.
[00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:33.656]  You like the fact that you lost an hour last night?
[00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:34.276]  I don't.
[00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:35.999]  I don't like that at all.
[00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.350]  There's no such thing as nullification and cessation.
[00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.450]  We settled that question a long time ago.
[00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:11.494]  I just go to Gettysburg and look at this stuff and said well you can also go to a bunker hill in Yorktown because I'm sure that the British government said that you can't leave the you can't leave the king at that time as well.
[00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.154]  That's always going to be the case.
[00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:17.476]  But there is a peaceful method in our Constitution.
[00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:18.376]  It's called nullification.
[00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:26.314]  And people have already peacefully nullified a part of the unconstitutional war on drugs that Jeff Sessions likes so much.
[00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:34.825]  We have over 30 states, over 60% of the states, have declared medical marijuana or just outright legalized it.
[00:14:35.105 --> 00:14:36.327]  That is nullification, folks!
[00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:39.569]  Marijuana is prohibited under the U.N.'
[00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:40.669]  's, and it is the U.N.'
[00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:41.370]  's drug schedule.
[00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:41.990]  The U.N.
[00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.031]  created that drug schedule, by the way, conservatives.
[00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:48.432]  Did you know that when you fight for the war on drugs, you're fighting for a U.N.
[00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:48.972]  agenda?
[00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:50.273]  Think about that.
[00:14:51.192 --> 00:14:59.798]  They created the four schedules, they put all the drugs in the four schedules, they did it ten years before Nixon implemented the UN agenda verbatim for you.
[00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:00.298]  How's that?
[00:15:00.878 --> 00:15:01.279]  How's that?
[00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:06.822]  And we've been suffering under that now for a half a decade, and it hasn't helped any addiction, has it?
[00:15:07.383 --> 00:15:19.691]  But it has given us a lot of corruption, it has created a prison population that is greater in absolute numbers, let alone the percentage of the population, but greater in absolute numbers than any other country, even communist dictatorships.
[00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:21.813]  Here in America.
[00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:27.417]  And it has corrupted our law enforcement, it's corrupted our constitution, our legal system.
[00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:29.759]  But it hasn't done anything to our addiction rate.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.261]  Hasn't done anything to that.
[00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:36.605]  But anyway, we're going to take a look at some other issues.
[00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:38.967]  We've got Mother's Day cards going gender neutral.
[00:15:38.987 --> 00:15:39.788]  Can you believe this?
[00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:50.896]  And actually, it has something to do, I think, with why Rex Tillerson is in darkest Africa and totally out of the loop on North Korea.
[00:15:50.937 --> 00:15:58.565]  So we're going to tell you the connection between gender-neutral Mother's Day cards and Rex Tillerson's Africa trip when we come back.
[00:15:58.605 --> 00:15:59.006]  Stay with us.
[00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.335]  Only one thing is constant in the universe and that's change.
[00:16:08.255 --> 00:16:08.615]  Cycles.
[00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.217]  But in cycles there are seasons.
[00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:12.718]  History repeats itself.
[00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:13.719]  Some have said it rhymes.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.883]  And just as the world and plants and animals have cycles and seasons, so do we.
[00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:33.952]  And even though it seems sometimes that those of us that are pushing for human liberty and freedom are being demonized and being attacked and being lied about in the media, even though it seems like we're being destroyed, it's great to be a winter soldier.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.101]  Not a sunshine patriot.
[00:16:37.582 --> 00:16:42.306]  Because it's those of us that stand up when it's hardest that end up making the greatest change.
[00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:45.428]  And the truth is, it's been a blessing to fight the globalists.
[00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:48.791]  It's been a blessing to go through these tribulations because it's taught me so much.
[00:16:49.472 --> 00:16:54.236]  And I used to read history books and hear other speakers and people that have been through adversity talk about how it made them stronger.
[00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:56.397]  And I just didn't understand it when I was a young person.
[00:16:56.898 --> 00:17:04.084]  But as I get older, I realize that it's through those experiences that I've really learned to not back down and to really stick with the core values that I know
[00:17:04.844 --> 00:17:07.706]  We really, really have changed the world in the past and are changing it now, today.
[00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:08.827]  We're changing the world.
[00:17:09.447 --> 00:17:11.808]  And the corrupt power structures that have seized control, they know that.
[00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:13.149]  And they're upset.
[00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.690]  And they're angry.
[00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.572]  Because we're simply trying to get people to awaken.
[00:17:17.832 --> 00:17:18.853]  Not to believe what we believe.
[00:17:18.873 --> 00:17:19.873]  Not to think what we think.
[00:17:20.754 --> 00:17:24.456]  But to only question the messages that they're getting.
[00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:30.160]  Only question the information that's being pushed when you see mainstream media or Hollywood or any of that.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:40.429]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks, it's come out in so many other corporate documents that they get together and plan these operations to twist the will of the people and to basically bully folks into submission.
[00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:44.953]  And followers, of course, are always going to give in to that because they're followers.
[00:17:45.593 --> 00:17:46.474]  And we feel sorry for them.
[00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:48.056]  But for those of us that are leaders...
[00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:51.753]  We know winter is really the summer.
[00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:53.634]  We know summer is really the winter.
[00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:58.698]  Because in the summer time, everything's plentiful, we become decadent, we become weak.
[00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:05.983]  But in the winter, we remember what it is that makes us humans, the quest between good and evil, and the great gift of consciousness and free will.
[00:18:07.031 --> 00:18:12.092]  So it's been an amazing 23 years in the fight of the Infowar, and more happens now in a month than happened in a year previous.
[00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:17.974]  And all of you aren't just part of the Infowar, you're not just some accessory, you are the heart of it.
[00:18:18.354 --> 00:18:31.297]  So for myself, my wonderful crew, and all of you that have put up with me, because Lord knows I'm not perfect, this is the fight of our lives, it's the crossroads of human destiny, and I am just very thankful to be here, and I'm very, very blessed to know you all, and
[00:18:32.441 --> 00:18:36.505]  The only sad part is to know how evil the globalists are and how weak and pathetic their servants are.
[00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:40.508]  I wish that they knew what they were doing, the mid-level and low-level ones.
[00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:43.231]  I wish they understood the really evil forces that are controlling them.
[00:18:43.391 --> 00:18:45.773]  But I think, deep down, they do know that.
[00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:51.678]  And that's why they're so angry at me, because I'm trying to wake them up out of the brainwashing, out of the control.
[00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:56.662]  Again, not to believe what I believe, but to open their eyes and just see.
[00:18:57.323 --> 00:18:58.884]  Not shudder themselves with
[00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:03.190]  Virtual reality goggles that are the smartphones of this culture.
[00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.331]  And then let them just pound you into what they want you to be so they can feel like they're a god.
[00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:11.231]  They're trying to destroy our free will.
[00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:13.892]  And InfoWars is fighting for a future that's good.
[00:19:14.472 --> 00:19:15.832]  There's a war for the future happening.
[00:19:16.532 --> 00:19:18.972]  And InfoWars could not do anything we do without you.
[00:19:19.653 --> 00:19:20.833]  So again, God bless you all.
[00:19:20.853 --> 00:19:22.393]  Please spread this video to everybody you know.
[00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:27.134]  And know this, they can't stop the signal because the truth is viral.
[00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:38.975]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:48.601]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[00:19:48.881 --> 00:19:53.984]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[00:19:54.264 --> 00:19:57.126]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:00.328]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:10.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.620]  You found it.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.621]  The tip of the spear.
[00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:28.383]  It is The Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:33.390]  Welcome back on this Sunday.
[00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:39.216]  I'm David Knight and of course you'll find me Mondays through Fridays 8 to 11 on the InfoWars Network.
[00:20:39.736 --> 00:20:41.298]  We have a daily show there.
[00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:55.152]  But I told you before we went to the break that I would tell you how Mother's Day gender-neutral cards that are now being proposed by some store in the UK, I don't know if this is a drugstore,
[00:20:56.232 --> 00:20:57.973]  Or a grocery store.
[00:20:58.293 --> 00:20:58.974]  It's Waitrose.
[00:20:59.254 --> 00:21:00.835]  Waitrose, I think is the way you pronounce that.
[00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:01.696]  But it's in the UK.
[00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:05.678]  And they're now putting out gender-neutral Mother's Day cards.
[00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:12.723]  It's going to require a completely new language if we go down this mentally ill path.
[00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:15.464]  And of course they've already got a completely new language for us.
[00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:16.905]  I'll tell you about that in just a moment.
[00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:23.630]  But I told you before we went to the break that I would tell you how these gender-neutral Mother's Day cards relate to T-Rex.
[00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.091]  Rex Tillerson in Africa.
[00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:27.232]  Why is he in Africa?
[00:21:27.272 --> 00:21:28.933]  Well, I'm going to get to that in just a moment.
[00:21:28.973 --> 00:21:32.376]  But first, let's talk about the beginning of this.
[00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:34.757]  Mother's Day cards, gender neutral.
[00:21:35.138 --> 00:21:42.463]  They say they're going to broaden out, no pun intended, they're going to broaden out the mothers who the cards can go to.
[00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:47.126]  And so they have Happy You Day cards in the Mother's Day section.
[00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:49.608]  The word mother does not appear.
[00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:51.450]  Now you might think that that's silly.
[00:21:52.213 --> 00:21:53.493]  But it's really not funny, folks.
[00:21:54.314 --> 00:22:00.856]  We have schools that have been working for quite a long time, seriously, working on getting rid of the terms mother and father.
[00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:03.036]  They said there were hateful terms.
[00:22:03.856 --> 00:22:05.337]  You can't have the terms mother and father.
[00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.818]  You have to understand how, at what a fundamental level
[00:22:09.673 --> 00:22:11.335]  These people want to destroy our society.
[00:22:12.055 --> 00:22:14.878]  They don't want to just get rid of the Christopher Columbus statues.
[00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:15.519]  No, no, no, no.
[00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:18.021]  They don't want to just get rid of Western civilization.
[00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:19.663]  They don't want to just purge Christianity.
[00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:25.129]  They want to impose upon us a kind of gender insanity.
[00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.132]  If you will, a new kind of birth control.
[00:22:29.298 --> 00:22:32.900]  We have this is a brave new world that they're trying to operate here.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.443]  We've got sperm counts that are crashing because of toxins in the water and the food and so forth.
[00:22:40.103 --> 00:22:46.286]  But it's also this kind of insanity where they're trying to stop all kinds of natural procreation.
[00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:47.986]  It's an attack on the family.
[00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:51.528]  It's an attack on everything that the basis of our culture.
[00:22:51.628 --> 00:22:52.328]  Let me tell you something.
[00:22:52.348 --> 00:22:55.069]  The basis of our society is not government.
[00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:55.790]  How about that?
[00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.811]  What is the basis of our society?
[00:22:57.891 --> 00:22:58.651]  Is it the individual?
[00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:02.925]  I'm a libertarian, but the basis of our society is not an individual.
[00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:07.311]  The basis of our society is the family.
[00:23:08.308 --> 00:23:08.969]  The family!
[00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:13.872]  That is why they have to make Mother's Day cards, no longer Mother Day cards.
[00:23:14.753 --> 00:23:15.673]  Or Father's Day cards.
[00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:22.578]  But they're not just coming after the Father's Day cards, because they are perhaps too toxically masculine.
[00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:24.260]  No, they're coming after mothers.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:24.900]  Mothers.
[00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:30.924]  And they have cards like, Two Moms Are Better Than One, or Dad, Thanks For Being The Most Amazing Mum.
[00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:36.568]  These are some of the cards that these people are putting at the store in the UK.
[00:23:37.642 --> 00:23:42.323]  But let's take a look at some of the other things that these trans activists are doing.
[00:23:43.183 --> 00:23:44.544]  I mean, we've seen this many times.
[00:23:44.564 --> 00:23:50.845]  Remember Justin Trudeau, when he told that young questioner, don't say mankind.
[00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:55.727]  And then after everybody called him on the insanity, he said, I was just joking.
[00:23:56.267 --> 00:24:00.628]  Well, was Justin Trudeau joking when he was very happy the fact that back in February,
[00:24:01.537 --> 00:24:11.685]  That the Canadian National Anthem had had its lyrics changed so that they would be gender neutral instead of, in all thy sons command, in all of us command.
[00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:18.370]  And he tweeted out at the time, this bill to make O Canada gender neutral passed third reading in the Senate tonight.
[00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.972]  Another positive step towards gender equality.
[00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:24.415]  In all of us command, he does hashtag.
[00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:31.723]  And then you can take a look at how this insanity plays out in college campuses, because that's where most of this stuff is being taught.
[00:24:32.964 --> 00:24:37.787]  You send your kids away for what you think is going to be an essential part of their career.
[00:24:39.008 --> 00:24:44.271]  It's going to give them an advance in terms of earning a wage.
[00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:45.612]  Well, to some degree.
[00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:48.914]  To some degree with some degrees.
[00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:51.456]  And other degrees you don't get any advantage.
[00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:54.722]  But what they do is they load them up with debt.
[00:24:55.902 --> 00:24:58.842]  And they cover them with this kind of insanity.
[00:24:58.882 --> 00:25:01.503]  Look at what campus reform has uncovered.
[00:25:01.783 --> 00:25:12.325]  At Kennesaw State University, the LGBT Resource Center has produced a new pamphlet that has seven different gender-neutral pronouns.
[00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:19.307]  Things like knee, V, A, Z. I don't even know how to pronounce the difference of pronouncing Z-E and X-E.
[00:25:19.547 --> 00:25:20.047]  I don't even know.
[00:25:21.818 --> 00:25:25.460]  And I'll give you an example of what some of their sample sentences sound like.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.281]  It sounds like you've got a speech impediment.
[00:25:28.782 --> 00:25:29.963]  Here's one example.
[00:25:30.663 --> 00:25:33.065]  Refer to a student who identifies as knee.
[00:25:33.705 --> 00:25:36.487]  One could say, knee, left, that is nears.
[00:25:38.548 --> 00:25:40.049]  What is this, clockwork orange?
[00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:41.190]  Yeah, it is.
[00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.971]  Very well, little brother.
[00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:46.713]  Yeah, they've got a whole new language that they're creating.
[00:25:47.093 --> 00:25:48.614]  And you better understand what they're doing.
[00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:50.155]  Yeah.
[00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:52.117]  They and their droogs.
[00:25:52.357 --> 00:25:54.339]  This is what they're trying to impose upon us.
[00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:57.841]  It is a kind of insanity that they're putting on us.
[00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:07.269]  I remember we had Corporal Klinger in MASH all those years, trying to get a Section 8 so he could get out, dressing as a woman so they would say he was crazy.
[00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:08.530]  That's what Section 8 is.
[00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:16.056]  They knew that he didn't really mean it, but these people really mean it, and now we've got a Pentagon that is bringing in transgender troops.
[00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:27.107]  Because then they're going to burden that institution with that insanity, as well as burden the taxpayer with their operations that they want to do.
[00:26:27.327 --> 00:26:28.928]  There he is, Corporal Klinger.
[00:26:30.709 --> 00:26:40.095]  See, sometimes this stuff starts out as silly, and sometimes they put it out there as funny, but you better understand they're deadly serious about this stuff.
[00:26:40.196 --> 00:26:42.197]  We can laugh at it, but they're deadly serious about it.
[00:26:43.332 --> 00:26:59.539]  Now let's go on to the reactions because this is, I want to get down through the North Korea stuff to get to the link between the transgender insanity that we're seeing here with Mother's Day and the transgender insanity that we're seeing with the State Department in Africa.
[00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:02.560]  And Rex Tillerson is right at the center of that.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.042]  So let's start here with reactions to the peace talks with North Korea.
[00:27:07.722 --> 00:27:09.343]  As I pointed out on
[00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:13.376]  Friday, at the beginning, there was a lot of praise.
[00:27:13.456 --> 00:27:22.547]  Erin Burnett said, wow, after she talked to a panel of six or eight people, she said, if this really happens, and if President Trump pulls us through, he'll go down as a great president.
[00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:23.308]  No question about that.
[00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:24.129]  You can't question that.
[00:27:25.066 --> 00:27:25.886]  And she was being honest.
[00:27:26.387 --> 00:27:27.687]  And that was what happened in the beginning.
[00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:30.149]  And then everything changed.
[00:27:30.969 --> 00:27:45.036]  And even people on MSNBC, and of course Chris Matthews, when he was looking at President Trump's moves to protect the steel and aluminum industries, but especially the steel industries, Chris Matthews, who's from Pennsylvania, said this is going to be a big win for President Trump.
[00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:47.877]  He said this is a cultural touchpoint.
[00:27:48.398 --> 00:27:50.419]  Because people understand that there's a society
[00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:51.659]  It's being destroyed.
[00:27:51.699 --> 00:28:05.966]  Just as they understood that Obama and Hillary Clinton wanted to destroy the economies and the manufacturing base of the coal industry in West Virginia and other places like that, the steel industry and the manufacturing industry, and it is much broader than just steel.
[00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:13.829]  We have seen the establishment Republicans and Democrats under the mantle of open trade eviscerate our economy.
[00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:15.050]  You want to talk about a trade war?
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:27.173]  The Chinese and the globalist shills, I guess we could call them quislings here in America, have been bombing our economy, our factory, our manufacturing base.
[00:28:27.193 --> 00:28:28.895]  They've been bombing it for 50 years.
[00:28:30.156 --> 00:28:31.898]  It's a 50-year war against us.
[00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:37.980]  And it's about time we wake up and understand that we're not going to let this continue happening.
[00:28:38.081 --> 00:28:40.463]  It has been a stealth war, but everybody can see it now.
[00:28:40.503 --> 00:28:45.567]  I can't even believe that the Koch brothers are out there trying to lecture us on quote-unquote free trade.
[00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:50.972]  As I said over and over again on the show, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and folks, there's no such thing as free trade.
[00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:53.234]  We're going to talk about that later in the show as well.
[00:28:53.654 --> 00:28:58.158]  But I want to tell you the connection of Mother's Day and Rex Tillerson.
[00:28:58.198 --> 00:28:59.419]  I will get to it in the next section.
[00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:13.583]  We've got a bunch of specials running right now that are, in some cases, the biggest we've ever had.
[00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:16.523]  Because I want people to experience how good these products are.
[00:29:16.543 --> 00:29:25.286]  Because we're being censored, because we're being attacked, I ran a bunch of products, 50% off, like the fluoride-free toothpaste, and like the BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula and others.
[00:29:25.366 --> 00:29:26.146]  Those sold out!
[00:29:26.406 --> 00:29:32.367]  So we've got 20% off on super high-quality body armor, including backpack inserts that are so important for yourself and your children.
[00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:35.028]  This is something just out around town, you name it, it's good to have.
[00:29:35.488 --> 00:29:48.556]  Also, we've got 30-80% off site-wide massive limited-time savings as part of this Operation Paul Revere to defend the First Amendment, defend internet freedom, and of course, on top of all of that, we're going to do this so we can defend the Second Amendment.
[00:29:48.616 --> 00:29:49.757]  We need your financial support.
[00:29:49.777 --> 00:29:54.120]  So if you need water filtration, air filtration, you name it, it's all 30-80% off.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.421]  Almost all items.
[00:29:55.441 --> 00:29:58.362]  There's a few things where we're making like 30% profit on food.
[00:29:58.663 --> 00:29:59.843]  You can't 30% off or at set cost.
[00:29:59.863 --> 00:30:00.764]  They won't even let you do that.
[00:30:02.705 --> 00:30:04.606]  So there's a few things in there that are regular price.
[00:30:04.646 --> 00:30:05.666]  Those are already so low.
[00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:08.827]  But we already only mark stuff up at regular sell price ads.
[00:30:09.067 --> 00:30:10.087]  A 100% markup.
[00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:10.647]  But we're never at 100%.
[00:30:10.707 --> 00:30:12.948]  We're usually at about 50% off markups.
[00:30:12.968 --> 00:30:13.948]  We're talking 50%.
[00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:15.729]  Everybody else is three, four times markup.
[00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:18.390]  And I get it with taxes, regulations, the bureaucracy.
[00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.411]  You're running any company, you get lawsuits, you know, just all sorts of, you know, crazy, fake stuff, especially if you're InfoWars.
[00:30:23.431 --> 00:30:25.452]  So what I'm saying is, we need your support.
[00:30:25.472 --> 00:30:26.152]  We make it easy.
[00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:29.353]  30% off almost all items site-wide to help
[00:30:29.813 --> 00:30:34.857]  Just very important as an independent voice here.
[00:30:35.297 --> 00:30:50.748]  You know, over the last several years, your organization and mine have both become very, very mainstream producers of many health-enhancing products.
[00:30:50.768 --> 00:30:56.953]  And I gotta say, the value of what you're offering people is quite extraordinary, because if they go into a retail channel,
[00:30:57.093 --> 00:31:05.175]  There's so much markup in the retail channel that the ingredients have to be really, really cheapened if it's at a Whole Foods or at a grocery store or something like that.
[00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:10.496]  The value of the ingredients that you're putting in because you're selling directly to people is really extraordinary.
[00:31:11.156 --> 00:31:16.698]  I know I've got some of your products in our lab that we're looking at and the potency that we're seeing right now is super high.
[00:31:17.678 --> 00:31:23.459]  I mean, I know you didn't have me here to endorse your product line, but... No, I appreciate you doing it, because I... I mean, look, I know where to target.
[00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:24.540]  Plus, I want to sell good stuff.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.640]  We just go out to the industry leaders and say, what's the strongest turmeric out there?
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.962]  Well, 450 milligrams with a 90-something curcumin and... I mean, you're an expert on all this.
[00:31:33.002 --> 00:31:34.402]  That's as high as the industry gets.
[00:31:34.702 --> 00:31:35.342]  We go with that.
[00:31:35.362 --> 00:31:38.563]  A lot of folks, as you said, they're going to want to mark stuff up six, seven times.
[00:31:38.583 --> 00:31:40.023]  They want it to be low-priced.
[00:31:40.063 --> 00:31:42.564]  So it's 30 bucks, but there's a dollar of product.
[00:31:43.004 --> 00:31:44.405]  Not, you know, $10 a product.
[00:31:44.425 --> 00:31:45.126]  We see that all the time.
[00:31:45.446 --> 00:31:45.927]  All the time.
[00:31:46.287 --> 00:31:54.213]  And it's the curcuminoids and if you, you know, there's so much amazing scientific research and medical research out there on so many of the benefits of curcumin.
[00:31:54.253 --> 00:31:56.735]  You know, I think we published stories today on that.
[00:31:57.236 --> 00:31:59.838]  You know, for sports, for fitness, for recovery, for, you know,
[00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:01.639]  There's a lot we're not supposed to say, but it's known.
[00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:02.100]  Exactly.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.060]  There's things we can't say.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.781]  Both of us can't say.
[00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:04.501]  Because the country's so free.
[00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:04.781]  Yeah.
[00:32:05.102 --> 00:32:09.665]  You know, there's thousands of studies of what it does, and it's the ultimate antioxidant.
[00:32:09.725 --> 00:32:11.846]  And so, look, it's sold out in a month.
[00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:15.449]  I did 50% off, and we still made, like, you know, $6, $7 a bottle.
[00:32:15.469 --> 00:32:18.131]  Now it's going to be regular price, and it's still a good deal.
[00:32:19.131 --> 00:32:20.531]  I want folks to see how good it is.
[00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:23.192]  So, you know, that's sold out.
[00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:34.114]  The point is, is that we've got clearance apparel 80% off, three-way 50% off, Aegis body armor 20% off, InfoWars life, mind and body, that is 40% off.
[00:32:34.195 --> 00:32:35.395]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:32:35.855 --> 00:32:44.517]  All I'm saying is, please support the broadcast and take advantage of this and let the globalists know no matter how hardcore their attacks are, you're going to continue to support us because they just
[00:32:45.217 --> 00:32:48.119]  They just had a big fight yesterday, claiming they weren't sponsoring us anymore.
[00:32:48.379 --> 00:32:49.380]  And they never sponsored us.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.622]  But they were trying to get other sponsors to pull.
[00:32:52.682 --> 00:32:53.482]  It was a total hoax.
[00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:53.863]  Of course.
[00:32:54.183 --> 00:32:54.963]  That's what they do all the time.
[00:32:55.023 --> 00:32:56.324]  It's all a disinfo war.
[00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.155 --> 00:33:24.739]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:27.820]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:32.843]  Welcome back.
[00:33:33.163 --> 00:33:34.644]  As we left, I said, we're going to take a look.
[00:33:35.376 --> 00:33:40.480]  The way people reacted to President Trump's North Korean initiative that we have here.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.644]  And of course, understand it was his being the bad cop, South Korea being the good cop.
[00:33:46.684 --> 00:33:49.526]  They're bringing Kim Jong-un to the table.
[00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:55.029]  But of course, Rachel Maddow cannot allow that that is a good thing.
[00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:57.851]  She's got to show herself to be nothing but a partisan hack.
[00:33:57.871 --> 00:33:59.893]  Because who other than a partisan hack
[00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:05.394]  We're trying to pretend that denuclearizing North Korea is not a good thing.
[00:34:06.695 --> 00:34:11.979]  And so, I want to play you a clip of Rachel Maddow and how she responded to this.
[00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:14.521]  I mean, even the people on CNN, at least for a while.
[00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:26.118]  At least the people on CNN said, hey, this would be really good if we could stop this guy who is lobbing missiles over Japan and setting off one nuclear test after the other.
[00:34:26.158 --> 00:34:27.599]  This guy is really dangerous.
[00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:28.600]  He's looking for attention.
[00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:34.925]  Wouldn't it be a good thing if we could stop that by just giving him a selfie with President Trump?
[00:34:35.105 --> 00:34:35.886]  Is that all it takes?
[00:34:36.426 --> 00:34:39.709]  Give this guy the attention that he wants and then take away his nuclear toys?
[00:34:40.549 --> 00:34:41.310]  I think that'd be a great thing.
[00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.992]  But Rachel Maddow is not really so sure.
[00:34:44.052 --> 00:34:44.933]  Here's what she has to say.
[00:34:46.097 --> 00:34:49.960]  You might imagine another president in this circumstance.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.541]  Kim Jong-un makes a request.
[00:34:51.562 --> 00:34:52.782]  You want to meet?
[00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:55.204]  You might think, like, another president in this circumstance.
[00:34:55.224 --> 00:35:03.110]  You can imagine a president asking himself or herself, why has no other American president ever agreed to do this?
[00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.011]  Good question.
[00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:04.611]  I've asked that.
[00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:08.955]  Why has no sitting American president ever met with a leader from North Korea?
[00:35:10.555 --> 00:35:15.057]  That never happened in all the decades North Korea has existed as a nation.
[00:35:15.517 --> 00:35:17.558]  Why hasn't any other president ever done?
[00:35:17.979 --> 00:35:22.141]  Should I take that to mean that this might be a particularly risky or even an unwise move?
[00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:30.345]  See, I think that's how most presidents would approach the idea of a personal presidential meeting with the North Korean dictator.
[00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:38.889]  I think a lot of people probably suspect tonight that those are not the kinds of questions that this president asked himself before agreeing to this meeting.
[00:35:40.874 --> 00:35:44.558]  But this is the president we have, and he said yes to North Korea.
[00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:50.485]  The New York Times tonight headlining this breaking news as quote, a breathtaking gamble.
[00:35:51.426 --> 00:35:51.786]  Oh wow.
[00:35:52.507 --> 00:35:55.310]  And this is the president that we have saying yes to North Korea.
[00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.013]  She tries to portray it as us saying yes to North Korea.
[00:35:58.033 --> 00:35:59.495]  You know who said yes to North Korea, Rachel?
[00:36:00.427 --> 00:36:04.050]  All your Obama and Clinton and State Departments, that enabled these people.
[00:36:04.731 --> 00:36:09.815]  How about the fact that you had the guy that you love so much, President Obama, you fawned over him, didn't you?
[00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:19.264]  This is newsbusters.org points out that Rachel Maddow fawned over President Obama when he said yes to the North Koreans.
[00:36:19.584 --> 00:36:22.286]  That was a good thing, because it was President Obama, wasn't it, Rachel?
[00:36:23.603 --> 00:36:28.846]  That's what a hopeless, smarmy, snarky hack she is.
[00:36:29.026 --> 00:36:30.867]  Just disgusting to watch her there.
[00:36:31.467 --> 00:36:32.407]  Lying through her teeth.
[00:36:32.928 --> 00:36:33.628]  Lying through her teeth.
[00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:44.453]  She had said when Obama pushed for the Iran nuclear deal, she said, it's the major foreign policy achievement, not only of this presidency, but of the American generation.
[00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:45.829]  That's right.
[00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.412]  It was a foreign policy achievement, but not for America's benefit.
[00:36:50.053 --> 00:36:52.575]  For the Iranian benefit.
[00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:55.017]  It's amazing.
[00:36:55.318 --> 00:36:59.721]  You might think, she said, why has no other American president ever agreed to do this?
[00:36:59.741 --> 00:37:02.123]  That's the right question, but she gives the wrong answer.
[00:37:02.864 --> 00:37:07.588]  She said, should I take it to mean that this might be particularly risky or even an unwise move?
[00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:09.130]  Let me tell you what is unwise.
[00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:15.907]  Let's just sit there and let these people continue, because obviously he is willing to do anything.
[00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:25.056]  What is going to happen, Rachel, if in some of these moves where he lobs missiles over Japan, if it actually hits Japan?
[00:37:25.957 --> 00:37:28.819]  People are going to be, they're going to have to respond to that then.
[00:37:29.737 --> 00:37:31.539]  You think it'd be a better thing to have a war, I guess.
[00:37:32.659 --> 00:37:37.163]  So you have an MSNBC, another host, says, well, it's definitely risky.
[00:37:37.223 --> 00:37:49.913]  So one of the things this would do, if we have a picture of Kim Jong-un and President Trump standing next to one another, this actually achieves one of Kim Jong-un's longstanding and his father's goal, which is to elevate North Korea.
[00:37:51.054 --> 00:37:51.955]  So that's the risk.
[00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.510]  That's the risk.
[00:37:53.990 --> 00:38:01.854]  We cannot lose our prestige by having our president take a selfie with the North Korean president.
[00:38:02.074 --> 00:38:08.337]  That is what MSNBC, that's their desperate attempt to try to say that this is a bad idea to talk to them.
[00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:21.103]  No, it'd be much better, wouldn't it, MSNBC, to just allow this little dictator to continue his nuclear program, his missile program, until he shoots a missile at Guam or lands one on Japan.
[00:38:22.102 --> 00:38:24.904]  And then we have the whole area erupt into war.
[00:38:24.964 --> 00:38:25.885]  Oh, that would be much better.
[00:38:25.925 --> 00:38:29.087]  Let's take the advice of the hacks at MSNBC.
[00:38:29.147 --> 00:38:30.488]  To me, that's a small price to pay.
[00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:39.994]  And we've had Michael Malice, who spent a lot of time in North Korea, say, this guy just wants attention.
[00:38:40.114 --> 00:38:43.716]  Let's give him a little bit of attention if we can denuclearize the place.
[00:38:43.736 --> 00:38:45.637]  There is no risk involved in this.
[00:38:45.798 --> 00:38:50.361]  Understand that the deal that has been announced is that nothing is going to change in the sanctions,
[00:38:51.212 --> 00:38:52.013]  Until they have the meeting.
[00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:56.135]  And unless he denuclearizes, nothing is going to change.
[00:38:56.175 --> 00:39:04.301]  He is still going to be under siege with the largest military in the world pointed at his country.
[00:39:05.421 --> 00:39:08.503]  He has nothing to gain but to denuclearize at this point.
[00:39:08.523 --> 00:39:09.384]  But then we got another hack.
[00:39:10.376 --> 00:39:11.377]  Another Democrat hack.
[00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:12.899]  This is Tommy Vitor.
[00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:15.301]  He is someone who worked with Obama.
[00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:17.984]  He was Obama's former National Security Council spokesman.
[00:39:18.504 --> 00:39:21.447]  And he tweets out, why would the Trump administration announce this?
[00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:23.229]  Like it's some kind of accomplishment.
[00:39:23.429 --> 00:39:28.014]  It's a conversation with a homicidal dictator, not an invitation to the Met Gala.
[00:39:29.448 --> 00:39:30.189]  Really, really.
[00:39:30.709 --> 00:39:41.236]  So, the reason he would do this, Obama, national security spokesman, yeah, Obama left us with a lot of national security, didn't he?
[00:39:42.116 --> 00:39:52.944]  We don't have secure borders, we don't have a secure situation with North Korea or with Iran, anybody else, but really the answer is to disarm them, not to arm them
[00:39:53.894 --> 00:39:57.336]  Like you and the Clintons did with Iran and China and others?
[00:39:58.136 --> 00:39:59.377]  I mean, that's what the Democrats have done.
[00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:13.163]  Dan McLaughlin of National Review came back and pointed out that his boss had spent his time going to Havana, Cuba and palling around with the President there, who had run Communist death squads.
[00:40:13.183 --> 00:40:14.904]  That's Raul Castro, who's still there.
[00:40:14.924 --> 00:40:19.466]  He said, in fact, the two-year anniversary of their super awkward handshake is coming up later this month.
[00:40:20.216 --> 00:40:20.716]  How about that?
[00:40:21.497 --> 00:40:23.858]  This is the hypocrisy of the left.
[00:40:23.898 --> 00:40:30.902]  But I want to take a moment here with Rex Tillerson, because the top of Drudge yesterday said Tillerson is sick.
[00:40:32.082 --> 00:40:34.444]  He's not going to meet with anybody in Kenya.
[00:40:35.704 --> 00:40:41.407]  And then later on he's coming out and saying, well, I'm feeling a little bit better.
[00:40:41.807 --> 00:40:44.089]  I think what he was sick of is being left out of the loop.
[00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:45.950]  As I reported this on Friday,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:55.247]  They said, this is AP saying, several Pentagon officials had said shortly before the announcement that they had no knowledge of what the South Koreans planned to announce.
[00:40:55.267 --> 00:41:11.682]  So the South Koreans came in and talked to President Trump privately, then they came out and announced that President Trump and Kim Jong-un would be meeting to talk about denuclearizing North Korea, and that nothing was going to change unless they did that, and until they did that, after the meeting.
[00:41:12.776 --> 00:41:20.080]  But at the same time, they reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had just hours before that announcement said that the U.S.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.063]  was, quote, a long ways, unquote, from direct talks.
[00:41:25.263 --> 00:41:28.845]  That was Tillerson in the dark, in the dark continent.
[00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:36.630]  The secretary is not feeling well, he said the next day, after a long couple of days working on major issues back home, such as North Korea.
[00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.871]  And he has canceled his events for the day.
[00:41:39.511 --> 00:41:40.132]  So think about that.
[00:41:41.101 --> 00:41:43.982]  They managed to put that in the statement, saying he's kind of sick.
[00:41:44.402 --> 00:41:47.283]  You know, because of that North Korea stuff that he was left out of the loop in.
[00:41:48.143 --> 00:41:52.845]  To me, I'm hoping this is what the coded message is.
[00:41:53.705 --> 00:41:55.026]  I am sick of this job.
[00:41:55.066 --> 00:41:56.166]  I hope he is sick of this job.
[00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:58.147]  I hope he joins Gary Cohen.
[00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:01.348]  I think there's a door at the White House with a label on it.
[00:42:01.408 --> 00:42:03.249]  It's a door that leads out of the White House.
[00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:03.809]  There's an exit.
[00:42:04.209 --> 00:42:09.631]  And hopefully there is a door there that somebody in the White House has put a sign on that says, Globalist Enter Here.
[00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:14.676]  Because I would like to see him join his fellow globalist, Gary Cohen, and just get out.
[00:42:15.897 --> 00:42:18.340]  This is a guy who has fought President Trump.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.062]  He's been wrong on every issue.
[00:42:22.046 --> 00:42:30.911]  And even when you look at what we knew about this guy before he came in, when I heard that he was being rumored to be the Secretary of State, I said, why?
[00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:33.792]  Why in the world would we have this guy?
[00:42:33.832 --> 00:42:40.856]  This is a guy who has pushed climate change, and he continued to do that through the first six months of presidency.
[00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:43.157]  He was a key man pushing back against President Trump.
[00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:44.798]  He wanted to end this Paris Climate Treaty.
[00:42:45.538 --> 00:42:48.640]  But I'm going to tell you, finally get to it in the next segment, finally tell you,
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.065]  Why he was there and how that ties to a gender-neutral Mother's Day.
[00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:57.128]  Yes, it all runs through Rex Tillerson, even though he's in Africa.
[00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:58.870]  We'll tell you about the insanity when we return.
[00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:59.291]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.038 --> 00:43:07.302]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:43:08.023 --> 00:43:11.346]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:43:12.187 --> 00:43:19.474]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[00:43:20.214 --> 00:43:26.560]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.625]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:43:33.225 --> 00:43:45.356]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:51.561]  Makaru from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.

[00:44:06.127 --> 00:44:09.228]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:44:09.248 --> 00:44:09.788]  You're on the air.
[00:44:09.808 --> 00:44:10.328]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:10.729 --> 00:44:11.829]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:12.649]  Hey, brother.
[00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:13.289]  Good, man.
[00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.130]  Thank you for calling.
[00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.770]  Hey, hey.
[00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.272]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:44:19.492 --> 00:44:25.874]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:44:25.994 --> 00:44:27.694]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:44:27.774 --> 00:44:34.577]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:44:35.097 --> 00:44:36.217]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:40.279]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:42.339]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:43.480]  And exactly.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.721]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:48.361]  Boom!
[00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:51.322]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:44:51.382 --> 00:44:51.922]  It's amazing.
[00:44:51.962 --> 00:44:56.344]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:45:01.725 --> 00:45:02.525]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:45:02.545 --> 00:45:03.586]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:03.626 --> 00:45:03.946]  Go ahead.
[00:45:04.879 --> 00:45:06.760]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:16.207]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:45:17.308 --> 00:45:20.670]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:21.390]  Absolutely.
[00:45:43.904 --> 00:45:56.796]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:46:04.909 --> 00:46:06.330]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.811]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:46:07.871 --> 00:46:08.231]  Go ahead.
[00:46:08.331 --> 00:46:08.632]  Yes.
[00:46:09.052 --> 00:46:09.772]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:09.893 --> 00:46:16.077]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:46:16.297 --> 00:46:20.280]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.961]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:29.026]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:31.968]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:37.551]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:45.416]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:51.260]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.683]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:46:56.723 --> 00:46:59.785]  And it's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:47:05.135 --> 00:47:07.726]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.772 --> 00:47:27.232]  Welcome back.
[00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:32.356]  We're going to take a look at Rex Tillerson and what he is trying to do in Kenya.
[00:47:32.957 --> 00:47:34.198]  To the Kenyan boys.
[00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.780]  What the State Department is doing.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.803]  $600,000 investment to mess with their gender.
[00:47:40.963 --> 00:47:42.064]  It's not just here in America.
[00:47:42.244 --> 00:47:43.265]  And it's the State Department.
[00:47:43.325 --> 00:47:44.166]  And it's Rex Tillerson.
[00:47:44.246 --> 00:47:45.367]  And he has a history of doing this.
[00:47:45.387 --> 00:47:49.190]  We're going to get back to that and I'll wrap up the connection between Rex Tillerson
[00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:53.412]  And gender-neutral Mother's Day cards in just one moment.
[00:47:53.452 --> 00:47:58.014]  But before I do, real quickly, I want to let you know about the sales that we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:58.034 --> 00:47:59.875]  It's part of our Operation Paul Revere 2018.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.040]  We have extended this stuff because, you know, it's very important for you to purchase from us directly.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:15.685]  We don't live by ads that are sold for Big Pharma on our site, like CNN does.
[00:48:15.745 --> 00:48:16.705]  But they're trying to shut us down.
[00:48:16.725 --> 00:48:24.771]  They think they can shut us down by getting YouTube to take our videos off, to take our channel off, to demonetize our channel.
[00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:26.492]  That's not how we make our money.
[00:48:26.552 --> 00:48:27.953]  We make our money through the products.
[00:48:27.993 --> 00:48:30.815]  We fund this operation through the products that we sell at our site.
[00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:37.239]  And of course, we have some of the finest products that you're going to find that will help your health, as well as the health of your family.
[00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:38.060]  Natural products.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:56.798]  That we don't have to, when I tell you about these products, I don't have to spend 30 seconds rapidly running through a list of dangerous side effects like heart disease, stroke, and all these other things that you typically hear on the big pharma commercials on CNN and other cable news outlets.
[00:48:56.818 --> 00:48:59.180]  But let me give you an idea of some of the sales here because we've got sales
[00:48:59.961 --> 00:49:04.203]  Throughout the site, 30 to 80% off, plus free shipping.
[00:49:04.623 --> 00:49:07.324]  We have Super Male and Female Vitality, 50% off.
[00:49:07.364 --> 00:49:09.525]  Let me tell you some of the other popular products we have at 50% off.
[00:49:09.565 --> 00:49:21.409]  We've got Pollen Block, Immune Wall to help your immune system naturally, Real Red Pill, Biome Defense, True Whey Protein, Prebiotic Fiber, that is fiber plus probiotics.
[00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:24.492]  We also have InfoWars Life Select products.
[00:49:24.852 --> 00:49:27.815]  That's our storable food products, 40% off.
[00:49:28.216 --> 00:49:31.119]  Our apparel, some apparel is at 80% off.
[00:49:31.679 --> 00:49:34.883]  And we have the Aegis Armor Backpack Insert, 20% off.
[00:49:36.331 --> 00:49:43.337]  As I said once before, and I got singled out by one of these news, leftist news outlets for saying it.
[00:49:44.197 --> 00:49:50.462]  Remember the time the guy took the, first he went to the FBI office in Alaska and said, I've got voices in my head telling me to shoot people.
[00:49:51.043 --> 00:49:53.845]  I said, oh that's nice, have a nice day, we're not going to do anything about it.
[00:49:53.885 --> 00:49:59.590]  And they got on a plane and he flew to Florida and he started shooting people up with his pistol that he managed to get through security.
[00:50:01.091 --> 00:50:04.354]  Started shooting people up in the airport and I said, this is the state
[00:50:05.348 --> 00:50:06.988]  of our security, our TSA.
[00:50:07.228 --> 00:50:09.589]  As much as they harass you, they don't do anything to protect you.
[00:50:09.629 --> 00:50:19.931]  I said, at the very least, put an armor backpack insert into your backpack and take it with you, so you've at least got a little bit of something to hide behind.
[00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:23.852]  If all you can do is just shelter in place, at least you can have something that's going to stop a bullet.
[00:50:24.152 --> 00:50:24.953]  I got called out for that.
[00:50:24.973 --> 00:50:26.133]  I said, look at, they said, look at this.
[00:50:26.173 --> 00:50:30.854]  This guy is trying to profit off of a disaster here.
[00:50:31.866 --> 00:50:33.286]  I'm not trying to profit.
[00:50:33.387 --> 00:50:35.807]  I'm trying to help people to defend themselves.
[00:50:35.827 --> 00:50:37.628]  That's what we're talking about when we say a win-win situation.
[00:50:38.288 --> 00:50:44.390]  If we've got a solution that's going to help you to defend yourself when the government refuses to do so, they didn't get that guy's gun out of his hand.
[00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.071]  They didn't do anything when he complained about voices in his head.
[00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.312]  They're not going to do anything to protect you.
[00:50:49.352 --> 00:50:50.912]  Maybe you realize that by now.
[00:50:50.972 --> 00:50:54.094]  And if you have, take things into your own hands.
[00:50:54.214 --> 00:50:58.235]  And you can select food to store for a disaster.
[00:50:58.916 --> 00:51:03.818]  You can get things to help you to fight the toxins that are in your food, the environment.
[00:51:04.198 --> 00:51:06.539]  And you can also, you know, filter your water.
[00:51:06.799 --> 00:51:07.739]  Do a lot of things like that.
[00:51:07.819 --> 00:51:09.200]  Why is that a bad thing?
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.941]  I don't know why the left wants to call us out on that.
[00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:14.302]  But let's finish up with Rex Tillerson.
[00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:22.321]  As I just pointed out, he had, just hours before this happened, said, we're very, very long away from any kind of talks with North Korea.
[00:51:22.981 --> 00:51:24.722]  And then it was announced that it was happening.
[00:51:24.822 --> 00:51:28.263]  And this is while he's in Africa, in the dark, in the dark continent.
[00:51:28.963 --> 00:51:38.485]  And he was going to be in, he was in Nairobi on Friday, and he was going to have a ceremony that was going to mark 20 years after Al Qaeda had bombed the U.S.
[00:51:38.525 --> 00:51:41.746]  embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people.
[00:51:44.227 --> 00:51:50.092]  See, Al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad terrorism is all over Africa.
[00:51:50.873 --> 00:51:58.299]  You've got Kenya on the west, you've got Nigeria on the eastern side of Africa, but it's everywhere.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.782]  But Rex Tillerson is not so concerned about that.
[00:52:01.802 --> 00:52:04.845]  As a matter of fact, we've got another neocon, H.R.
[00:52:04.865 --> 00:52:09.029]  McMaster, who can't even bring himself to say the term radical Islam.
[00:52:10.202 --> 00:52:25.072]  And so to save face, and I really do hope he's not going to stick with this, I hope Rex Tillerson sees this as a personal affront and leaves like Gary Cohen did when he lost the debate on protecting our economy.
[00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:29.544]  Gary Cohen wanted to continue to sell us out to China and other countries.
[00:52:29.944 --> 00:52:33.288]  And when President Trump said, no, we're not going to do that, he said, all right, fine, you want my advice, I'll leave.
[00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:42.520]  Well, we don't want or need Rex Tillerson's advice, and we don't want or need his advice on the climate, and we don't want or need his advice on what the causes of terrorism are.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.603]  The State Department under Rex Tillerson.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:52.586]  Has spent $600,000 to explore gender identities of boys and men in Kenya.
[00:52:53.247 --> 00:53:04.097]  And when I first saw this announcement, where he was out of the loop, and of course now he's saying, oh yes, I was very busy with that, and I've been in the, he said on Friday, he said, this was not a surprise in any way.
[00:53:04.986 --> 00:53:12.469]  After having said, we're a long ways away from talk a couple of hours before, then President Trump does it and he says, well, this wasn't a surprise in any way.
[00:53:12.509 --> 00:53:13.810]  Then the next day he goes, I'm sick.
[00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:14.350]  I'm sick.
[00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:15.331]  I can't go to any meetings.
[00:53:15.871 --> 00:53:18.912]  Hopefully he's sick of being out of the loop.
[00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:21.053]  But this is what I'm sick of.
[00:53:21.313 --> 00:53:33.499]  I'm sick of our State Department continuing the Obama Nation policies of Barack Obama and trying to do gender confusion, not just in this country, but in other countries as well.
[00:53:34.431 --> 00:53:36.912]  Let me tell you how this is coming out.
[00:53:36.952 --> 00:53:40.374]  I reported this when this was announced back at the end of January.
[00:53:40.754 --> 00:53:42.895]  I haven't really seen anybody talk about this.
[00:53:43.655 --> 00:53:45.456]  The State Department is spending $600,000 to explore gender identities.
[00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:54.895]  They say that they want to, they suggest that the ideals of masculinity in Kenya are the cause of terrorism.
[00:53:55.455 --> 00:53:56.576]  No, it's not Islam.
[00:53:56.656 --> 00:54:00.859]  It's that toxic masculinity that needs to be taken down in Kenya.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:08.605]  And so Rex Tillerson's State Department is going to spend $600,000 because the enemy is masculinity, not Islam.
[00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:20.025]  They said, gender is increasingly recognized as an essential aspect to understanding and to countering violent extremism throughout the world, said the State Department, spending $600,000 of your money.
[00:54:20.746 --> 00:54:27.430]  They said, men and boys are disproportionately recruited by and join terrorist groups and carry out terrorist operations.
[00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.631]  So therefore, terrorism is male.
[00:54:31.392 --> 00:54:32.092]  It's not Islamic.
[00:54:32.432 --> 00:54:33.133]  It's a male thing.
[00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:38.590]  Except that they have female terrorists as well, and they have female suicide bombers as well.
[00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:42.635]  But let's not pay any attention to that, says the State Department under Rex Tillerson.
[00:54:43.015 --> 00:54:46.519]  In Kenya, they said, there currently exists no CVE.
[00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:48.961]  That's their countering violent extremism.
[00:54:49.341 --> 00:54:56.469]  There's no CVE programming dedicated to the role of gender of boys and men and vulnerability to violent extremism.
[00:54:57.898 --> 00:55:04.824]  So Tillerson's State Department lays the blame on terrorism, not of terrorism on male gender issues.
[00:55:05.465 --> 00:55:08.367]  Not on things like Boko Haram or Islam.
[00:55:08.427 --> 00:55:11.330]  And of course Boko Haram is in Nigeria.
[00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.931]  He was just in Nigeria as well.
[00:55:13.011 --> 00:55:15.954]  Maybe he's selling them the same gender confusion.
[00:55:16.594 --> 00:55:21.859]  Let me tell you, Rex Tillerson has been into gender confusion from the very beginning.
[00:55:22.759 --> 00:55:24.121]  He was head of the Boy Scouts.
[00:55:24.141 --> 00:55:25.262]  What did he do to the Boy Scouts?
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:37.243]  The same thing that he's, I guess he thought that the Boy Scouts are too toxic masculine because he allowed them, he pushed the idea that they would have homosexual scouts as he was head of the Boy Scouts.
[00:55:38.384 --> 00:55:41.745]  And then he pushed for homosexual scout leaders at the Boy Scouts.
[00:55:43.085 --> 00:55:50.007]  And then, keeping with his example, as he left, the Boy Scouts then began pushing for transgender scouts.
[00:55:51.926 --> 00:56:01.599]  This is the Rex Tillerson who now at the State Department is trying to bring gender confusion to the poor people of Kenya, as if that was their problem.
[00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.963]  You see, in Nigeria,
[00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.292]  Where they have the same problems as they do in Kenya.
[00:56:08.312 --> 00:56:10.914]  I just talked about how they had mass bombings in Kenya and so forth.
[00:56:10.974 --> 00:56:12.015]  It is Al Qaeda.
[00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:14.176]  It is radical Islam.
[00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:15.617]  It is Jihadism.
[00:56:16.638 --> 00:56:23.703]  Boko Haram literally means the people committed to the Prophet's teachings for propagation and Jihad.
[00:56:24.444 --> 00:56:27.166]  Now Boko Haram is really just the nickname.
[00:56:27.946 --> 00:56:31.769]  What it means is Western education is Haram.
[00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.530]  It's forbidden.
[00:56:34.108 --> 00:56:45.841]  And that's why they go in and capture all of these, they just captured a whole other group of young girls who were studying and getting educated at Western schools.
[00:56:46.021 --> 00:56:46.681]  Can't have that.
[00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:47.803]  Can't have that.
[00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:48.784]  So especially women.
[00:56:50.097 --> 00:56:50.718]  Can't have women.
[00:56:51.979 --> 00:56:57.123]  But that's toxic masculinity as the State Department and Rex Tillerson see it.
[00:56:57.363 --> 00:56:59.665]  It's not a problem with Islam.
[00:57:00.186 --> 00:57:02.307]  It's a problem with toxic masculinity.
[00:57:02.708 --> 00:57:04.389]  So what they need is some gender confusion.
[00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:10.074]  And who are the people that join Boko Haram in Nigeria?
[00:57:10.935 --> 00:57:14.197]  Well, they typically come from university students.
[00:57:14.938 --> 00:57:16.780]  You know, kind of like Antifa over here.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.461]  Those are the people.
[00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:20.812]  Uh, that, uh, join the group.
[00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:24.956]  Less than four years after the high-profile kidnapping of 200 girls.
[00:57:26.769 --> 00:57:34.171]  Boko Haram has now abducted another 110 girls from the region, out of a school in the region.
[00:57:35.212 --> 00:57:36.992]  That's what they're doing.
[00:57:37.112 --> 00:57:45.555]  But of course, as they misidentify the problem, that allows the military-industrial complex to sell them weapons.
[00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:46.455]  Last August, the U.S.
[00:57:46.475 --> 00:57:48.776]  sold Nigeria half a billion dollars worth of military gear.
[00:57:48.816 --> 00:57:49.336]  So we spend
[00:57:55.879 --> 00:58:00.902]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified Libtards on Twitter.
[00:58:00.982 --> 00:58:03.664]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[00:58:03.744 --> 00:58:09.727]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:12.068]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[00:58:12.248 --> 00:58:20.413]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[00:58:20.513 --> 00:58:23.375]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[00:58:23.795 --> 00:58:33.482]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[00:58:33.562 --> 00:58:36.805]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[00:58:36.905 --> 00:58:44.611]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:45.671]  Brain Force Plus.
[00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:47.813]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[00:58:47.853 --> 00:58:49.054]  It was hilarious.
[00:58:49.114 --> 00:58:49.334]  They...
[00:58:50.975 --> 00:58:53.176]  They wrote in Vice.com!
[00:58:53.296 --> 00:59:03.099]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley take some kind of new tropping.
[00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.540]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:12.582]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[00:59:13.162 --> 00:59:14.783]  Gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:22.269]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:24.431]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[00:59:24.451 --> 00:59:25.972]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[00:59:26.052 --> 00:59:26.312]  Good.
[00:59:26.532 --> 00:59:27.873]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[00:59:28.033 --> 00:59:32.756]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.118]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[00:59:35.558 --> 00:59:37.919]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[00:59:38.259 --> 00:59:41.160]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.661]  Get your Brain Force right now.
[00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:43.701]  Brain Force Plus.
[00:59:43.741 --> 00:59:46.762]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:54.545 --> 00:59:59.187]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:08.695 --> 01:00:12.718]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:00:13.098 --> 01:00:17.081]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.566 --> 01:00:33.092]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.878 --> 01:00:40.299]  Welcome back.
[01:00:40.339 --> 01:00:46.386]  In the next hour, we're going to be talking about gun control, how that is playing out in Florida with the RINO governor there.
[01:00:46.406 --> 01:00:53.556]  We're also going to be talking about the Trumponomics and the big win that President Trump has had with that.
[01:00:53.596 --> 01:00:56.560]  This is as big as the tax cut, folks.
[01:00:57.762 --> 01:01:02.945]  And make no mistake about it, the Chinese have been in a trade war with us for decades.
[01:01:03.645 --> 01:01:17.933]  And even as we passed massive tax and regulation cuts, as President Trump and the Republicans passed that, the response from the European Union was, this is something that is unfair advantage for the American people.
[01:01:18.873 --> 01:01:22.455]  And they threatened to take us to the World Trade Organization.
[01:01:22.475 --> 01:01:23.876]  They said nothing is off the table.
[01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:32.117]  We are going to appeal to the World Trade Organization because of America's domestic tax and regulation cuts.
[01:01:33.018 --> 01:01:34.719]  See, they're not going to cut their taxes.
[01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:35.920]  They're not going to cut their regulations.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.142]  They're strangling their economy.
[01:01:38.822 --> 01:01:42.745]  And they're strangling the sovereignty of the individual countries that they have taken over.
[01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.587]  And they were going to fight us on that.
[01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:49.190]  And so, this is not the beginning of the trade war.
[01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:54.034]  If you want to say the trade war started, well the trade war started with the tax cuts that Wall Street loved so much.
[01:01:54.926 --> 01:01:57.588]  The Wall Street doesn't love economic nationalism.
[01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.091]  Main Street does, however.
[01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:03.293]  Especially Main Street and the states that Trump needs to win.
[01:02:04.014 --> 01:02:05.135]  They absolutely do love it.
[01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:08.158]  So we're going to talk a little bit about that and people's reactions to it and what it really means.
[01:02:08.918 --> 01:02:12.802]  I just want to finish up with what I ran out of time to say as we went to break.
[01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:16.025]  You know, when we look at what the big picture is here with Rex Tillerson,
[01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:24.353]  They spent, with the State Department, a half million dollars to go into Kenya and to misidentify the problem.
[01:02:25.013 --> 01:02:33.236]  To tell the people there that all the terrorism is because of toxic masculinity, and you need to feminize these boys like we're trying to feminize the Boy Scouts under Rex Tillerson.
[01:02:33.977 --> 01:02:39.559]  To say that we're going to have homosexual scouts, we're going to have homosexual leaders, and then we're going to have transgender scouts.
[01:02:39.639 --> 01:02:42.400]  That's been his agenda, that's been the agenda of the establishment.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.541]  Rex Tillerson is a globalist.
[01:02:46.178 --> 01:02:48.180]  And so they misidentify the problem.
[01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:50.402]  Spend a half million dollars to do that.
[01:02:50.662 --> 01:03:02.952]  And if they can move people away from seeing that the real problem is Islam, then they'll be able to sell them a half a billion dollars worth of arms from the military-industrial complex.
[01:03:02.992 --> 01:03:07.116]  See how they can turn LGBTQ into MIC?
[01:03:07.656 --> 01:03:09.017]  The military-industrial complex?
[01:03:09.618 --> 01:03:10.358]  It's just that simple.
[01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:11.740]  It's just that simple.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.641]  It is the way to
[01:03:14.867 --> 01:03:17.289]  Confused and to destroy and to divide people.
[01:03:17.889 --> 01:03:21.632]  But let's talk about somebody else in the White House staff here.
[01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.473]  White House Chief of Staff Kelly.
[01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:30.357]  Versus, I think, one of the best appointments that President Trump has made, Scott Pruitt at the EPA.
[01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:34.920]  Now one of the ideas that Scott Pruitt had was to have a debate.
[01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.844]  He wanted to, he's at the EPA, and he said, let's have
[01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:45.566]  Public debates that would challenge climate change scientists.
[01:03:45.707 --> 01:03:46.307]  Science, rather.
[01:03:47.187 --> 01:03:49.048]  And Michael Kelly now has shut that down.
[01:03:49.128 --> 01:03:49.808]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:49.928 --> 01:03:50.688]  That's a bad idea.
[01:03:51.008 --> 01:03:51.568]  That's a bad idea.
[01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:52.509]  No, it's a great idea.
[01:03:53.369 --> 01:03:54.689]  Because they can't win that debate.
[01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:08.494]  We started the program in the last hour with ten masked individuals, probably identifying with Antifa, attacking Tony Robinson in the UK.
[01:04:09.094 --> 01:04:09.694]  Ten against one.
[01:04:10.677 --> 01:04:11.561]  They had masks on.
[01:04:12.243 --> 01:04:13.207]  They hit him from behind.
[01:04:13.247 --> 01:04:15.155]  They circled in so they could hit him from every different angle.
[01:04:15.175 --> 01:04:16.119]  But he fought him off anyway.
[01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:22.943]  And that really is a metaphor for what would happen if we had a climate change debate.
[01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:23.804]  Let me tell you something.
[01:04:23.824 --> 01:04:33.568]  They've got all the quote-unquote talking heads and pundits and people with scientific authority to argue with people.
[01:04:33.588 --> 01:04:36.409]  Yeah, there's a clip of what happened with Tony Robinson.
[01:04:36.529 --> 01:04:37.490]  They've got all these people.
[01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.452]  They load up the debate on CNN and elsewhere.
[01:04:42.432 --> 01:04:49.600]  But they can't land a punch because they haven't really got a model or any experimental data to back it up.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.264]  If we had Lord Mockton point that out, it would be a great thing to happen.
[01:04:53.284 --> 01:04:55.346]  But of course, Kelly has shut that down.
[01:04:55.386 --> 01:04:56.187]  Stay with us when we come back.
[01:04:56.207 --> 01:04:57.188]  We're going to talk about gun control.
[01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:57.709]  We'll be right back.

[01:06:19.153 --> 01:06:21.957]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:28.293]  Welcome back.
[01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:45.109]  We're going to talk about gun control and what's happening in Florida in the wake of the school shooting down there in Parkland, Florida, the Stoneman Douglas School and talk about what the Republican governor did here and how the NRA has responded and we're also going to talk about Trumponomics and at the bottom of the hour we have joining us
[01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:49.816]  Christian Saussure, the sailor who was just pardoned by President Trump yesterday.
[01:06:49.836 --> 01:06:50.977]  I was so happy to see that.
[01:06:51.057 --> 01:06:52.477]  What a travesty that was.
[01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:53.958]  What a travesty it was.
[01:06:54.038 --> 01:07:00.881]  And President Trump had in the past tweeted out that it was a travesty, it was hypocrisy to let Hillary Clinton
[01:07:01.801 --> 01:07:06.744]  Get away with multiple felonies of the most classified documents?
[01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:16.710]  I mean, the stuff that she had, just as this fellow who took pictures, you know, those pictures did not go through a formal classification process.
[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:20.853]  They said if you take pictures anywhere within a submarine, it's going to be classified.
[01:07:20.913 --> 01:07:27.877]  Now, at the lowest level of classification, at confidential, but nevertheless, they would be born classified, is what we'd say.
[01:07:28.806 --> 01:07:34.828]  Now, do you think that Hillary Clinton's conversations with foreign leaders are born classified?
[01:07:35.648 --> 01:07:42.630]  If a picture of a bunk in a submarine is born classified, do you think that her conversations with foreign leaders are born classified?
[01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:43.170]  Of course they are!
[01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.311]  As a matter of fact, they're above top secret.
[01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:46.971]  Above top secret.
[01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:50.612]  But of course, the FBI director said he was going to let her go.
[01:07:51.472 --> 01:07:52.813]  Said she'd committed all these felonies.
[01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:55.173]  I can still remember listening to that.
[01:07:55.194 --> 01:07:56.294]  I was sitting there with my wife.
[01:07:57.270 --> 01:08:00.331]  And he's talking about these, uh, he's not lying to people.
[01:08:00.351 --> 01:08:02.352]  He's saying, yeah, yeah, she violated national security.
[01:08:02.372 --> 01:08:04.372]  I said, I can't believe this.
[01:08:05.593 --> 01:08:06.413]  Hillary for prison.
[01:08:07.954 --> 01:08:08.734]  He's gonna do it.
[01:08:09.514 --> 01:08:12.215]  And then, he did something even more unbelievable.
[01:08:13.095 --> 01:08:15.056]  He said, uh, but we're not gonna do anything about it.
[01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:20.593]  And then he doubled down on the unbelievable hypocrisy and said, but don't you try this at home.
[01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:23.435]  And then shortly after that, they went after Christian Saussure.
[01:08:23.455 --> 01:08:25.857]  So we're going to talk to him today.
[01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:29.499]  He's going to be joining us and telling us what this means for his life.
[01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:35.063]  I'm glad to see that President Trump noticed this and has done the right thing for him.
[01:08:35.103 --> 01:08:38.806]  But before we get into Gunter and Kroll, I just want to talk a little bit about Elizabeth Warren.
[01:08:39.486 --> 01:08:43.769]  Focahannes, or as James Woods called her, Liawatha.
[01:08:46.843 --> 01:08:57.529]  I talked about this on Friday, and now everybody is talking about the fact that on Friday I had the news that the Massachusetts Berkshire Eagle, the newspaper,
[01:08:58.459 --> 01:09:08.002]  Wrote an editorial and said, hey, Elizabeth Warren, you can get a DNA test for only $99, it's not a lot of money, and you can put this to rest one way or the other.
[01:09:08.642 --> 01:09:11.983]  Are you or are you not of Indian descent?
[01:09:12.863 --> 01:09:20.446]  Because you used that to get a leg up at the university there, to get a job that you weren't going to get if you were white.
[01:09:21.328 --> 01:09:34.440]  You claimed Indian heritage so you could not only do cultural appropriation but take a job that people of your ilk had reserved for people of different races.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:39.525]  They got different racial slots there and different kinds of discrimination depending on who you are.
[01:09:40.246 --> 01:09:43.289]  And so you identified as an Indian for those purposes.
[01:09:43.329 --> 01:09:44.450]  You tried to sell that.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.482]  And so, you know, do a DNA test and prove to us that you really are an Indian.
[01:09:49.542 --> 01:09:49.822]  It's only $99.
[01:09:50.543 --> 01:09:52.063]  If you can't afford it, we'll pay for it.
[01:09:52.103 --> 01:09:52.644]  How about that?
[01:09:53.124 --> 01:09:54.324]  All you have to do is spit in the cup.
[01:09:55.185 --> 01:09:56.786]  It's not even an intrusive process.
[01:09:57.646 --> 01:09:59.027]  Well, I talked about that Friday morning.
[01:09:59.827 --> 01:10:04.130]  And again, if you want to follow my program, it's Monday through Friday, 8 to 11.
[01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:06.411]  You can follow Real News with David Knight.
[01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:10.353]  Well, she came back over the weekend and said she's not going to do it, essentially.
[01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:22.876]  She doubled down and said, when asked again at a press conference whether she would take the DNA test, she said she was going to hold on to the folklore of her parents' love story.
[01:10:22.896 --> 01:10:26.478]  She said, my mother and daddy were born and raised in Oklahoma.
[01:10:26.518 --> 01:10:27.479]  And she gives this long story.
[01:10:27.519 --> 01:10:30.461]  I'll play this story for you that she had.
[01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:30.901]  But you know what?
[01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:38.306]  As I heard her story, ask yourself if maybe she didn't hear this from her mother and father.
[01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:45.381]  Maybe, you know, when she was younger, there was a top 40 novelty hit called Running Bear.
[01:10:46.262 --> 01:10:50.688]  And maybe that just somehow kind of worked its way into her psyche.
[01:10:50.748 --> 01:10:52.650]  Maybe that's going to be her excuse next.
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:56.796]  But here's what Elizabeth Warren said at the Focahontas press conference.
[01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:07.229]  I have to ask you, because I cover the White House and I hear the President going after you from time to time, referring to you as Pocahontas, and recently you were speaking about your Native American heritage.
[01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:10.411]  Does that get under your skin when he does that?
[01:11:10.651 --> 01:11:12.593]  And do you want to run for President in 2020?
[01:11:14.935 --> 01:11:19.437]  I am not running for president in 2020, but let me tell you my story.
[01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:23.458]  You know, my mother and dad were born and raised in Oklahoma.
[01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:28.640]  My father fell in love with my mother when they were both still teenagers.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.901]  And he was just head over heels over her.
[01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:39.048]  Literally opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.
[01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:42.352]  So does that bother you when the president calls you Pocahontas?
[01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:47.918]  Do you think that he is being disrespectful to Native Americans when he does that?
[01:11:48.619 --> 01:11:49.540]  Doesn't that bother you?
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.142]  Because of your family's heritage?
[01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:53.924]  This is what I was trying to tell you.
[01:11:54.084 --> 01:11:56.225]  It's about my family's story.
[01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:02.770]  Because my family's story is deeply a part of me and a part of my brothers.
[01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:05.151]  It's what we learned from our parents.
[01:12:05.331 --> 01:12:07.032]  It's what we learned from our grandparents.
[01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:10.054]  It's what we learned from our aunts and our uncles.
[01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:15.038]  I went to speak to Native American tribal leaders and I made a promise to them.
[01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.259]  She's identifying with him as a victim again.
[01:12:35.691 --> 01:12:38.535]  There we go.
[01:12:39.156 --> 01:12:40.878]  So she's a woman and an Indian.
[01:12:41.259 --> 01:12:44.583]  You can't really tell about that Indian thing and she's not going to prove it to you.
[01:12:44.984 --> 01:12:46.566]  But you know, she identifies.
[01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:52.981]  Remember we're talking about the transgender insanity that's being foisted upon our kids by our educational system.
[01:12:53.642 --> 01:12:59.006]  That's the influence of the federal government on education in your school, in the school that you send your kids to.
[01:12:59.727 --> 01:13:00.888]  They're pushing this on the kids.
[01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:02.809]  They're doing it in kindergarten.
[01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:09.112]  They're telling these young kids they can pick whatever sex they want to be, whatever race they want to be.
[01:13:09.132 --> 01:13:11.272]  See, you can be folk-a-honest too.
[01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:16.934]  You know, just like Elizabeth Warren, if you identify as being another race, you can be another race.
[01:13:17.054 --> 01:13:18.175]  Nobody can say anything about that.
[01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.195]  And they're telling that to kids in kindergarten.
[01:13:20.755 --> 01:13:26.077]  So she just needs to wait until these kindergarten kids grow up and vote, and they'll be perfectly fine with that.
[01:13:26.117 --> 01:13:28.898]  Because if she identifies as an Indian, whether she is or not,
[01:13:29.963 --> 01:13:39.470]  Then President Trump is racist to criticize her for trying to appropriate their culture and trying to appropriate the set-asides that they got from the Democrats.
[01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:43.372]  She comes in and says, I can get that job because I'm an Indian.
[01:13:43.873 --> 01:13:45.454]  That's the issue here, folks.
[01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:52.279]  Never forget that the demagogue party that uses demographics all the time to divide us
[01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:58.790]  Well, use those same demographics to take their own privilege.
[01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.950]  You understand?
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:06.053]  She took that away from them, and she used it and claimed privilege to get her job at Harvard.
[01:14:06.593 --> 01:14:08.033]  I think it was Harvard that she was going to.
[01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:10.694]  But anyway, she used that job.
[01:14:10.754 --> 01:14:15.616]  Now they're saying the Democrats are pledging to limit superdelegates, but they don't really know how they're going to do it yet.
[01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:24.479]  And I find it interesting that Tom Perez, the current DNC chairman, says the party will, quote, improve the democratic process before 2020.
[01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:28.222]  Well, that implies that there's something wrong with what they did.
[01:14:28.242 --> 01:14:30.124]  Is there something wrong with what they did?
[01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:33.567]  I think there is, but they won't admit it.
[01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:35.229]  You're not going to find them admitting that.
[01:14:35.249 --> 01:14:37.270]  All right, let's take a look at gun control.
[01:14:37.611 --> 01:14:40.193]  And let's look at the shameful things that Republicans are doing here.
[01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:42.951]  Trying to identify as Democrats.
[01:14:43.071 --> 01:14:47.116]  I guess that you could say that Governor Rick Scott is now identifying as a Democrat.
[01:14:47.537 --> 01:14:52.643]  In the same way that Fokohanas or Liawatha is identifying as an Indian.
[01:14:53.424 --> 01:14:56.728]  You've got Governor Rick Scott signing a $400 million big spending bill.
[01:14:59.031 --> 01:14:59.411]  There you go.
[01:14:59.471 --> 01:15:00.713]  That's identifying with Democrats.
[01:15:01.213 --> 01:15:11.863]  And then putting in gun control and confiscating guns from people who are peaceful, law-abiding citizens that are now going to be banned from having guns.
[01:15:12.323 --> 01:15:14.846]  This is what this carpetbagger in Florida is doing.
[01:15:14.906 --> 01:15:15.406]  Rick Scott.
[01:15:15.706 --> 01:15:16.327]  This rhino.
[01:15:16.367 --> 01:15:17.408]  Republican in name only.
[01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:20.150]  The bill also bans bump stocks.
[01:15:21.095 --> 01:15:25.379]  And as Breitbart points out, they weren't even used in the Florida school shooting.
[01:15:26.059 --> 01:15:29.542]  I'm not sure the bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas shooting either.
[01:15:29.642 --> 01:15:31.824]  None of that stuff really adds up.
[01:15:32.665 --> 01:15:39.030]  As a matter of fact, we see pictures of a bump stock and a bipod on the same gun.
[01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:41.171]  Now you're not going to use those two things together.
[01:15:41.712 --> 01:15:43.934]  We've had people demonstrate that it doesn't work when you do that.
[01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:48.718]  And we've got ballistics calculations reportedly found on the table.
[01:15:49.298 --> 01:15:51.020]  And yet you're going to do a spray and pray?
[01:15:51.961 --> 01:15:55.646]  None of that stuff makes any sense, but neither does the gun control bill.
[01:15:55.686 --> 01:15:56.887]  We'll talk about that when we return.
[01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:57.328]  Stay with us.
[01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:03.415]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:04.590]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowarslife.
[01:17:05.131 --> 01:17:12.535]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:17.937]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:17:18.537 --> 01:17:20.457]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:17:21.078 --> 01:17:24.499]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:17:25.299 --> 01:17:27.760]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:35.103]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:17:35.703 --> 01:17:42.947]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:50.470]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:52.111]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:17:52.471 --> 01:17:54.312]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[01:19:00.672 --> 01:19:03.474]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:04.095 --> 01:19:07.657]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:08.057 --> 01:19:11.020]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.381]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:13.942 --> 01:19:18.365]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:19:18.685 --> 01:19:20.747]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:19:21.027 --> 01:19:27.412]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:28.032 --> 01:19:35.240]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:36.221 --> 01:19:40.886]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:41.286 --> 01:19:48.273]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:53.378]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:19:53.818 --> 01:19:56.661]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:19:56.681 --> 01:19:58.382]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:18.419 --> 01:20:19.320]  You found it.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.161]  The tip of the spear.
[01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:24.143]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.844 --> 01:20:28.546]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:33.671]  Welcome back.
[01:20:34.072 --> 01:20:38.655]  In the next segment, we're going to have Christian Saussure, the sailor that President Trump pardoned yesterday.
[01:20:39.496 --> 01:20:42.958]  And it was an incredible miscarriage of justice.
[01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:56.408]  It was a double standard that we saw happen with this poor sailor who was sent to jail for a year for a couple of pictures that were born classified at the lowest level, confidential.
[01:20:57.549 --> 01:21:03.073]  But he's out now and now he has had his future given back to him by President Trump.
[01:21:03.093 --> 01:21:07.618]  So we want to celebrate that with him and we want to talk to him about that.
[01:21:07.658 --> 01:21:11.761]  Have him give his perspective on what has happened and what that means in his life.
[01:21:11.781 --> 01:21:13.383]  So he'll be joining us in the next segment.
[01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:16.646]  Anxious to talk to Christian Saussure.
[01:21:17.186 --> 01:21:19.989]  I want to finish up on gun control because we had the Florida governor
[01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.311]  Sign a $400 million gun control bill.
[01:21:22.331 --> 01:21:28.938]  Let me tell you what is in this, besides banning bump stocks, which were not even alleged to have been used in the Florida shooting.
[01:21:30.099 --> 01:21:36.105]  But it also, the bill was originally going to allow teachers to be armed on a broader basis.
[01:21:36.846 --> 01:21:39.088]  But they had to have that augmented.
[01:21:39.168 --> 01:21:42.552]  Governor Scott didn't want teachers to be armed for self-defense.
[01:21:43.715 --> 01:21:44.575]  He doesn't like that idea.
[01:21:45.175 --> 01:21:46.716]  He only wants people with uniforms.
[01:21:46.756 --> 01:21:47.876]  And of course, where did he get that idea?
[01:21:47.896 --> 01:21:51.297]  Well, he got that idea from the Florida Education Association, the FEA.
[01:21:52.337 --> 01:22:02.980]  And they told him, they said, we urge you to honor your instincts and to act to keep additional firearms from our schools unless they're in the hands of trained law enforcement personnel.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:07.421]  You know, those official people in uniform that stood outside and did nothing?
[01:22:08.402 --> 01:22:09.222]  The Sheriff's Department?
[01:22:09.302 --> 01:22:11.742]  The people who were assigned to protect that school and did nothing?
[01:22:12.243 --> 01:22:13.283]  Those uniform characters?
[01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:22.286]  Meanwhile, you've got a real hero who had nothing but his body to put in the way of the bullets.
[01:22:23.469 --> 01:22:24.050]  And he was killed.
[01:22:24.813 --> 01:22:26.274]  Why don't we allow heroes?
[01:22:26.294 --> 01:22:28.175]  You don't have to wear a uniform to be a hero.
[01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:33.658]  And as we saw with these cowardly sheriff's deputies, you can wear a uniform and not be a hero.
[01:22:33.978 --> 01:22:42.343]  How about allowing people who have the disposition, the ability, who have been vetted, who have been trained, who are not afraid of guns, who understand what this is about.
[01:22:42.403 --> 01:22:46.326]  How about giving them some tools to protect themselves and to protect other people?
[01:22:47.486 --> 01:22:53.190]  See, the answer in this case is to allow more liberty, not take liberty away.
[01:22:54.315 --> 01:22:55.636]  That's the way we get a better society.
[01:22:55.716 --> 01:22:58.638]  It's always the right answer to add more freedom.
[01:22:59.618 --> 01:23:03.061]  And to give freedom to law-abiding, responsible people.
[01:23:04.001 --> 01:23:06.483]  Because they don't need to be the only people unarmed in the room.
[01:23:07.823 --> 01:23:11.466]  See, the crazy people, the criminal people, they're going to be able to get guns on the black market regardless.
[01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:16.229]  Do you think that your gun-free zones are any more real than your drug-free schools?
[01:23:16.749 --> 01:23:16.929]  No.
[01:23:17.329 --> 01:23:18.390]  Your schools aren't drug-free.
[01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:19.691]  Your schools aren't gun-free.
[01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:24.307]  And we need to allow people to at least defend themselves against guns.
[01:23:26.744 --> 01:23:32.446]  Anyway, as I go through this, the immediate response of the NRA was to sue Florida over the gun bill.
[01:23:33.026 --> 01:23:35.787]  Same day that Governor Scott signed it into law.
[01:23:36.147 --> 01:23:43.329]  They said, we filed a lawsuit against the state for violating the constitutional rights of 18 to 21-year-olds, said the NRA.
[01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:55.413]  And they said, this blanket ban violates the fundamental rights of thousands of responsible law-abiding Florida citizens and is thus invalid under the Second and the Fourteenth Amendments.
[01:23:56.556 --> 01:24:01.000]  I see the 14th Amendment, that's kind of equal protection of the law, that's what we're talking to Christian Saucier about.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:07.225]  It means that people in power don't get special privileges that the rest of us don't enjoy.
[01:24:07.245 --> 01:24:11.428]  But of course, FBI Director James Comey isn't down with that idea.
[01:24:11.729 --> 01:24:13.790]  We've got a lot of people in Washington that don't agree with that.
[01:24:14.331 --> 01:24:16.973]  The complaint says the law particularly affects young women.
[01:24:18.377 --> 01:24:25.058]  The NRA said females between the ages of 18 and 21 pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting.
[01:24:25.818 --> 01:24:29.139]  Have we had any school shootings of females between the ages of 18 and 21?
[01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:31.139]  Not that I'm aware of.
[01:24:31.779 --> 01:24:37.800]  They said, however, they are frequently the victims of that type of crime.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.361]  And let me give you an example of this.
[01:24:39.381 --> 01:24:42.721]  This is a case that was highlighted by Reason Magazine.
[01:24:44.241 --> 01:24:46.962]  And they asked if, this is a situation with
[01:24:48.891 --> 01:24:57.473]  It's an Illinois woman who is a licensed firearm owner and looking to live in the East St.
[01:24:57.513 --> 01:24:59.594]  Louis Housing Authority's homes.
[01:25:00.014 --> 01:25:00.314]  Tenants.
[01:25:00.474 --> 01:25:09.116]  And they said, well, sorry, you are licensed to own a firearm, but you have to prove to us that you don't have one before you can live here.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.401]  We have to take your firearms.
[01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:19.305]  Now, she has filed a complaint, and the plaintiff, they don't give her name, she's listed as Ms.
[01:25:19.325 --> 01:25:19.625]  Doe.
[01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:22.186]  She wants to keep the weapon for self-defense.
[01:25:22.846 --> 01:25:23.187]  Why?
[01:25:24.107 --> 01:25:30.230]  Because she has repeatedly been threatened, well, she's been repeatedly threatened with her ex-boyfriend.
[01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:36.133]  And they say, according to the complaint, she's being actively threatened by her abusive ex-husband.
[01:25:36.153 --> 01:25:37.534]  Sorry, not boyfriend, but husband.
[01:25:37.874 --> 01:25:39.195]  A convicted murderer!
[01:25:40.216 --> 01:25:54.664]  Who, while on parole, visited shocking violence on her, including choking her into unconsciousness, beating her so severely that she bled internally, and threatening to kill her and her children should she end their relationship.
[01:25:55.744 --> 01:26:08.551]  So she's married to this guy, he goes to jail for murder, he gets out, she doesn't want to have anything to do with him, and then he chokes her into unconsciousness, beats her so severely she had internal bleeding.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:09.900]  I don't know.
[01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:37.220]  And her ex-husband was sent back to prison because of the assaults on her, where he beat her until she was bleeding internally.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:42.205]  This murderer, convicted murderer, who got out on parole.
[01:26:42.765 --> 01:26:43.806]  I don't understand that.
[01:26:45.147 --> 01:26:46.548]  Why isn't this guy still in prison?
[01:26:46.789 --> 01:26:52.053]  He went back to prison because he beat her up, but now he's out again, and he has been threatening her again.
[01:26:52.998 --> 01:26:59.179]  But the government that won't keep this guy in prison won't let her have a firearm to protect herself.
[01:26:59.259 --> 01:27:01.840]  That's what the NRA is saying about in Florida.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:09.761]  They're saying you're taking away guns from law-abiding citizens 18 to 21, and you're taking away guns from women who are 18 to 21.
[01:27:09.921 --> 01:27:13.862]  Not going to allow them to protect themselves.
[01:27:13.882 --> 01:27:16.783]  Because, you know, you gotta have a man in uniform around to protect you.
[01:27:16.803 --> 01:27:18.983]  Well, the men in uniform aren't always there.
[01:27:19.997 --> 01:27:23.200]  Honest cops, like Sheriff Clark, will tell you.
[01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:24.681]  He told his own people.
[01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:27.604]  He said, look, we'll do everything we can to protect you.
[01:27:28.085 --> 01:27:29.586]  And we'll get there as soon as we can.
[01:27:30.327 --> 01:27:36.072]  But when you call the police, understand that you're going to have to be able to protect yourself until we can get there.
[01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:40.997]  And so he said, get a firearm and learn how to use it responsibly.
[01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:44.211]  And things are not going to get any better in Florida.
[01:27:44.671 --> 01:27:51.074]  The Democrats voted unanimously to take away the guns from the 18 to 21-year-olds, and they're not going to stop there.
[01:27:51.774 --> 01:27:59.657]  Democrat Representative Deutch said the gun bill that Florida signed is, quote, merely the beginning of the response to Parkland.
[01:28:00.237 --> 01:28:02.818]  Yeah, he wants to ban all the guns, folks.
[01:28:03.719 --> 01:28:04.719]  We've reported this many times.
[01:28:04.859 --> 01:28:06.340]  You know that this is where they're headed.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.841]  They have talked about this multiple times.
[01:28:09.639 --> 01:28:12.703]  We went to the gun control rally here in Austin.
[01:28:13.585 --> 01:28:24.280]  They had the mayor of Pro Tem, the number two guy in the city of Austin, get up there and they had one counter protester of all these people who were protesting our ability to protect ourselves.
[01:28:25.001 --> 01:28:26.543]  One counter protester with a sign up there.
[01:28:27.668 --> 01:28:28.348]  And we filmed that.
[01:28:28.948 --> 01:28:29.848]  We were there reporting on it.
[01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:30.329]  We filmed it.
[01:28:30.869 --> 01:28:31.709]  They all got around him.
[01:28:31.749 --> 01:28:34.389]  They started pushing him and shoving him.
[01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:37.710]  And the mayor pro tem of Austin said, you hang on.
[01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:42.871]  His sign said, we're not going to allow you to confiscate and ban guns.
[01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:44.932]  And he said, you hang on to that sign.
[01:28:45.572 --> 01:28:47.012]  Because we're not talking about doing that now.
[01:28:47.052 --> 01:28:47.712]  But we will be.
[01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:48.452]  We will be.
[01:28:48.692 --> 01:28:52.093]  And that's exactly what this Florida Democrat is saying as well.
[01:28:52.213 --> 01:28:53.574]  No, we're gonna come for all the guns.
[01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.214]  Stay with us.
[01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:59.818]  We'll be right back with Christian Saussure, the sailor that President Trump pardoned yesterday.
[01:29:04.642 --> 01:29:07.123]  Only one thing is constant in the universe, and that's change.
[01:29:08.064 --> 01:29:08.444]  Cycles.
[01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.006]  But in cycles, there are seasons.
[01:29:11.566 --> 01:29:12.527]  History repeats itself.
[01:29:12.687 --> 01:29:13.548]  Some have said it rhymes.
[01:29:14.768 --> 01:29:19.652]  And just as the world and plants and animals have cycles and seasons, so do we.
[01:29:21.437 --> 01:29:35.882]  And even though it seems sometimes that those of us that are pushing for human liberty and freedom are being demonized and being attacked and being lied about in the media, even though it seems like we're being destroyed, it's great to be a Winter Soldier, not a Sunshine Patriot.
[01:29:37.382 --> 01:29:39.603]  Because it's those of us that stand up when it's hardest.
[01:29:40.731 --> 01:29:42.092]  That end up making the greatest change.
[01:29:43.152 --> 01:29:45.213]  And the truth is, it's been a blessing to fight the globalists.
[01:29:45.253 --> 01:29:48.574]  It's been a blessing to go through these tribulations because it's taught me so much.
[01:29:49.254 --> 01:29:54.016]  And I used to read history books and hear other speakers and people that have been through adversity talk about how it made them stronger.
[01:29:54.036 --> 01:29:56.157]  And I just didn't understand it when I was a young person.
[01:29:56.677 --> 01:30:03.860]  But as I get older, I realize that it's through those experiences that I've really learned to not back down and to really stick with the core values that I know.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.502]  We really, really have changed the world in the past and are changing it now, today.
[01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:08.602]  We're changing the world.
[01:30:09.243 --> 01:30:11.584]  And the corrupt power structures that have seized control, they know that.
[01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:12.945]  And they're upset.
[01:30:13.925 --> 01:30:14.486]  And they're angry.
[01:30:14.946 --> 01:30:17.347]  Because we're simply trying to get people to awaken.
[01:30:17.608 --> 01:30:18.628]  Not to believe what we believe.
[01:30:18.668 --> 01:30:19.649]  Not to think what we think.
[01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:24.251]  But to only question the messages that they're getting.
[01:30:25.032 --> 01:30:29.955]  Only question the information that's being pushed when you see mainstream media or Hollywood or any of that.
[01:30:30.555 --> 01:30:40.225]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks, it's come out in so many other corporate documents that they get together and plan these operations to twist the will of the people and to basically bully folks into submission.
[01:30:40.526 --> 01:30:44.750]  And followers, of course, are always going to give in to that because they're followers.
[01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:46.272]  And we feel sorry for them.
[01:30:46.592 --> 01:30:47.854]  But for those of us that are leaders...
[01:30:49.246 --> 01:30:51.567]  We know winter is really the summer.
[01:30:52.268 --> 01:30:53.428]  We know summer is really the winter.
[01:30:54.289 --> 01:30:58.511]  Because in the summer time, everything's plentiful, we become decadent, we become weak.
[01:30:58.891 --> 01:31:05.775]  But in the winter, we remember what it is that makes us humans, the quest between good and evil, and the great gift of consciousness and free will.
[01:31:06.806 --> 01:31:11.929]  So it's been an amazing 23 years in the fight of the Infowar, and more happens now in a month than happened in a year previous.
[01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:17.753]  And all of you aren't just part of the Infowar, you're not just some accessory, you are the heart of it.
[01:31:18.153 --> 01:31:31.081]  So for myself, my wonderful crew, and all of you that have put up with me, because Lord knows I'm not perfect, this is the fight of our lives, it's the crossroads of human destiny, and I am just very thankful to be here, and I'm very, very blessed to know you all, and
[01:31:32.239 --> 01:31:36.282]  The only sad part is to know how evil the globalists are and how weak and pathetic their servants are.
[01:31:36.902 --> 01:31:40.304]  I wish that they knew what they were doing, the mid-level and low-level ones.
[01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:43.026]  I wish they understood the really evil forces that are controlling them.
[01:31:43.186 --> 01:31:45.148]  But I think, deep down, they do know that.
[01:31:45.588 --> 01:31:51.492]  And that's why they're so angry at me, because I'm trying to wake them up out of the brainwashing, out of the control.
[01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:56.455]  Again, not to believe what I believe, but to open their eyes and to just see.
[01:31:57.116 --> 01:31:58.677]  Not shudder themselves with
[01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:02.988]  Virtual reality goggles that are the smartphones of this culture.
[01:32:03.328 --> 01:32:08.109]  And then let them just pound you into what they want you to be so they can feel like they're a god.
[01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:11.030]  They're trying to destroy our free will.
[01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:13.671]  And InfoWars is fighting for a future that's good.
[01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:15.632]  There's a war for the future happening.
[01:32:16.332 --> 01:32:18.773]  And InfoWars could not do anything we do without you.
[01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:20.633]  So again, God bless you all.
[01:32:20.653 --> 01:32:22.174]  Please spread this video to everybody you know.
[01:32:22.214 --> 01:32:26.935]  And know this, they can't stop the signal because the truth is viral.
[01:32:30.964 --> 01:32:35.686]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:32:35.946 --> 01:32:41.489]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:50.654]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there and we're adding more and more every day of the very best products out there.
[01:32:50.814 --> 01:32:58.618]  So go to FortifiedSupply.com today to not just see the great products we offer there, but links to some of the other great sponsors that we have as well.
[01:32:58.718 --> 01:33:00.679]  That's FortifiedSupply.com.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.461]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.721 --> 01:33:13.763]  You found it.
[01:33:14.043 --> 01:33:16.764]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:16.984 --> 01:33:19.465]  It is The Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:33:33.673 --> 01:33:34.133]  Welcome back.
[01:33:34.194 --> 01:33:37.956]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking in this segment to Christian Saussure.
[01:33:37.996 --> 01:33:41.979]  He's the man, the former sailor that President Trump pardoned yesterday.
[01:33:41.999 --> 01:33:43.520]  We're very glad to hear that happen.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:47.083]  I want to talk to him about what this means for his life, talk to him about the case.
[01:33:47.243 --> 01:33:49.064]  We've had him on the show in the past.
[01:33:49.745 --> 01:33:55.409]  But I want to play for you first the press conference where Sarah Sanders announced his pardon.
[01:33:55.529 --> 01:33:56.350]  Here's Sarah Sanders.
[01:33:57.133 --> 01:34:01.715]  In other news today, the president has pardoned Christian Saussure, a Navy submariner.
[01:34:02.195 --> 01:34:07.737]  Mr. Saussure was 22 years old at the time of his offenses and has served out his 12-month sentence.
[01:34:08.037 --> 01:34:13.559]  He has been recognized by his fellow service members for his dedication, skill, and patriotic spirit.
[01:34:14.159 --> 01:34:18.721]  While serving, he regularly mentored younger sailors and served as an instructor for new recruits.
[01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:25.343]  The sentencing judge found that Mr. Saussure's offense stands in contrast to his commendable military service.
[01:34:26.124 --> 01:34:29.446]  It also stands in contrast to the way Hillary Clinton was allowed to get away.
[01:34:29.466 --> 01:34:36.011]  This is what we're talking about, folks, when we talk about unequal treatment under the law, the favoritism.
[01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:44.056]  But I want to focus on the positive side here for at least a good while here and talk to Christian Saussure about what this means for his life.
[01:34:44.537 --> 01:34:45.437]  Welcome, sir.
[01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:46.238]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:34:47.008 --> 01:34:48.429]  Thank you for having me on, David.
[01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:52.910]  We wanted to celebrate this with you, because this is something to celebrate, and it's long overdue.
[01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:54.151]  Glad to see this happening.
[01:34:54.391 --> 01:34:56.312]  What does this mean for your life?
[01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:59.473]  Tell us, you served a year in prison, and you're out now.
[01:34:59.833 --> 01:35:03.834]  What has life been like after you got out of prison, and how is this going to change at having a pardon?
[01:35:04.715 --> 01:35:06.375]  Well, you know, life's been pretty difficult.
[01:35:06.415 --> 01:35:11.958]  We had a lot of legal debt as a result of being taken to a civilian court instead of tried in the military, as I should have been.
[01:35:13.368 --> 01:35:14.890]  Seems I was active duty at the time.
[01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:19.235]  So, you know, we had a lot of debt and I went to prison for a year and I couldn't work.
[01:35:20.036 --> 01:35:24.020]  So, you know, my wife was the stay-at-home mom with our young child and her daughter.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:27.664]  So, it's been pretty difficult getting out of prison.
[01:35:27.744 --> 01:35:29.046]  I went on house arrest.
[01:35:29.806 --> 01:35:32.348]  I was allowed to work, and then I had to be home.
[01:35:32.408 --> 01:35:37.390]  I had an ankle monitor and a curfew, and I applied to many jobs.
[01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:43.474]  I have a pretty diverse skill set as a result of my training in the Navy operating nuclear power plants, but nobody would hire me.
[01:35:44.094 --> 01:35:57.801]  Fortunately, I was able to find work with a local waste management company and work as a trash collector, so I'm very grateful to them for hiring me and giving me lots of hours so that I can make sure that my family is taken care of.
[01:35:58.922 --> 01:36:03.004]  That is really sad, but this has been a load of garbage.
[01:36:03.024 --> 01:36:12.508]  Maybe in some of the garbage that you were hauling there, you could find some Democrat servers or something, but I'm glad to see that you've got a part now, because that's going to change things.
[01:36:12.528 --> 01:36:19.470]  It's going to allow you to have the opportunity to use your experience in the nuclear field to get a good job.
[01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:27.374]  And I think it's going to make a difference for you, even in terms of it's going to change your discharge from honorable, dishonorable to an honorable discharge.
[01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:29.683]  It doesn't exactly do that.
[01:36:29.763 --> 01:36:31.164]  So that's a whole other process.
[01:36:31.184 --> 01:36:33.066]  We have to fight to get done.
[01:36:33.866 --> 01:36:42.393]  Now that I have a pardon, obviously it gives us some ground to stand on, but the whole military side of it, I still have another than honorable discharge.
[01:36:42.433 --> 01:36:50.499]  So I still am not able to receive any of my disability benefits or any veterans benefits for that matter as a result of my 11 years of service.
[01:36:50.539 --> 01:36:52.601]  So that unfortunately hasn't changed.
[01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:58.986]  It's like anything else, it's a fight we're willing to go ahead and go into.
[01:37:00.027 --> 01:37:00.948]  But it's going to take time.
[01:37:02.389 --> 01:37:05.572]  Let me give out that site that you've got here because it sounds like you still need some help.
[01:37:06.232 --> 01:37:11.597]  And you've got a site there where people have been allowed to contribute to help you with your legal expenses.
[01:37:12.137 --> 01:37:17.179]  But people need to understand they still need to keep up some pressure to make sure that you get that honorable discharge.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.421]  It's helpchrissaucier.com.
[01:37:20.461 --> 01:37:30.665]  And that's helpchrissaucier.com.
[01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:34.847]  So people can look there and see what they can do to help you.
[01:37:34.887 --> 01:37:37.428]  But it is still a big help to have a pardon, isn't it?
[01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:38.571]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:37:38.611 --> 01:37:39.892]  I mean, we're so grateful.
[01:37:39.932 --> 01:37:42.615]  Yeah, I don't want to seem like a downer here.
[01:37:42.635 --> 01:37:49.863]  I mean, this is one of the few things in the past, you know, four or five years that's actually been a positive for my family.
[01:37:49.883 --> 01:37:53.587]  I mean, we've had so much loss and, you know, lost so many things.
[01:37:54.648 --> 01:37:56.129]  Just a lot.
[01:37:56.609 --> 01:38:03.754]  And this has just been a huge, you know, it's given us a lot more faith back in, you know, at least one person in Washington, D.C.
[01:38:03.774 --> 01:38:08.017]  I don't know if the rest of them are going to do the right thing, but I can tell you President Trump is.
[01:38:08.517 --> 01:38:11.038]  And, you know, and we've always supported him.
[01:38:11.199 --> 01:38:12.159]  He's a busy guy.
[01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:13.500]  He's had a lot of stuff going on.
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:22.906]  And for him to take the time to not only, you know, give us our lives back by granting me the pardon, but to take the time to call me and speak with me.
[01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:24.687]  I mean, we were just floored.
[01:38:25.848 --> 01:38:26.769]  What an amazing man.
[01:38:26.789 --> 01:38:30.372]  And we're just so fortunate to have him as our president.
[01:38:30.412 --> 01:38:33.054]  I mean, you know, the guy, he truly cares about
[01:38:34.068 --> 01:38:34.488]  The people.
[01:38:34.668 --> 01:38:36.249]  You know, he cares about the little people.
[01:38:36.269 --> 01:38:37.289]  I mean, that's what I am.
[01:38:37.309 --> 01:38:39.870]  You know, I'm not politically connected like Hillary Clinton.
[01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:42.970]  I'm not, you know, even like Joe Arpaio.
[01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:45.271]  I'm not somebody that's a well-known person like him.
[01:38:45.991 --> 01:38:52.313]  I'm just an average guy who, you know, all I wanted to do was serve in the military and serve my country and be a good citizen.
[01:38:52.373 --> 01:38:56.674]  And here he's reached out and he's touched the lives of somebody like me.
[01:38:57.188 --> 01:38:59.990]  And my family, and it's just amazing.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:25.187]  Well, we were talking about the fact that Hillary Clinton wasn't being held to any kind of a standard, and you were being held to an incredibly strict standard.
[01:39:25.248 --> 01:39:29.672]  As you pointed out, this is something that should have been looked at within the military.
[01:39:29.752 --> 01:39:33.575]  You took a couple of pictures in the area that you worked at as a souvenir.
[01:39:34.176 --> 01:39:40.802]  This was something that was, as soon as you took those pictures, they were born classified, but at the lowest level, confidential.
[01:39:41.082 --> 01:39:42.303]  And we've heard over and over again.
[01:39:42.463 --> 01:39:47.248]  Hillary Clinton, well, you know, she only had a dozen or so things that were classified that had the actual marking on it.
[01:39:47.828 --> 01:39:57.478]  But we know that with Hillary Clinton talking to foreign heads of state, that is born classified, and it is a level that is higher than top secret, and they want to pretend that that doesn't exist.
[01:39:57.518 --> 01:39:58.799]  That's the double standard that we saw.
[01:39:59.676 --> 01:40:00.377]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:00.397 --> 01:40:10.345]  And, you know, the fact, well, what's most disgusting is that they want you to believe that she didn't commit a crime because she lacked intent to cause national harm.
[01:40:10.385 --> 01:40:19.573]  And I can tell you for a fact, that was never a requirement under the statute they charged me, which is, by the way, the very same statute they could have charged her because I was not court-martialed.
[01:40:19.593 --> 01:40:22.335]  I was not held to a higher standard because I was in the military.
[01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:27.099]  I was tried in a civilian federal court by federal prosecutors from the DOJ, Obama's DOJ.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:35.548]  I can tell you, those same people, when Jim Comey said, there's no prosecutor that would bring a case against you, I can tell you that they brought a case against me for far less.
[01:40:35.968 --> 01:40:41.854]  And there was never a requirement, there was never any intention to cause national harm, and they never argued that point.
[01:40:42.815 --> 01:40:45.137]  Because they knew it would have just been heinous.
[01:40:46.138 --> 01:40:51.559]  Yeah, there's no way that a confidential classification of something is going to cause national harm.
[01:40:52.019 --> 01:40:57.681]  As a matter of fact, the definition for confidential is it will cause little to no harm if released to foreign adversaries.
[01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:01.842]  You know, whereas top secret will cause grievous harm to the national security.
[01:41:02.162 --> 01:41:09.943]  So Hillary Clinton had top secret and top secret SCI, which is above top secret, which is only supposed to be viewed in a SIF, on her personal server.
[01:41:10.663 --> 01:41:11.324]  It's a joke.
[01:41:11.724 --> 01:41:12.644]  It's a joke that
[01:41:14.024 --> 01:41:24.387]  You know, James Comey would even have the audacity to come out and tell the American people that, well, because she lacked intent, that she didn't cause, that she didn't break the law.
[01:41:24.747 --> 01:41:30.929]  I tell you, that's not a requirement for that statute, and anybody with a laptop or a phone can look that up and see that it's not a requirement.
[01:41:31.209 --> 01:41:31.769]  I don't think so.
[01:41:46.778 --> 01:41:48.659]  I wasn't not allowed to have those pictures.
[01:41:48.959 --> 01:41:53.461]  I just wasn't allowed to have them on my cell phone, which was an unsecured device because I possessed a secret clearance.
[01:41:53.862 --> 01:41:58.084]  I was allowed to maintain secret information, but I had them on an unsecured device.
[01:41:58.104 --> 01:42:00.725]  So I broke the law and I accepted responsibility for it.
[01:42:00.845 --> 01:42:02.906]  Unlike Hillary Clinton, I went to court.
[01:42:03.146 --> 01:42:03.966]  I didn't go to trial.
[01:42:04.006 --> 01:42:04.787]  I pled guilty.
[01:42:05.147 --> 01:42:06.087]  I took my punishment.
[01:42:06.368 --> 01:42:08.949]  I didn't speak out about it until I'd served my time in prison.
[01:42:09.369 --> 01:42:18.374]  And as I was serving my time in prison and watching somebody who should be in prison run for the highest office in this country, President of the United States, I was utterly disgusted.
[01:42:18.714 --> 01:42:24.957]  And I said, you know what, I'm going to wait until I get out and I'm going to speak out about this because people should be upset.
[01:42:25.337 --> 01:42:29.419]  You know, it's bad enough for me that my family and I have been through this.
[01:42:29.759 --> 01:42:36.005]  But the average American citizen should be very distraught, whether you're a conservative or a liberal, really is null and void.
[01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:41.290]  Because I can tell you right now, they're going to go after you while they're going to let these people walk.
[01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:41.871]  That's right.
[01:42:42.031 --> 01:42:42.391]  That's right.
[01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:43.412]  It's the double standard.
[01:42:43.432 --> 01:42:45.394]  You know, we have to have one standard of law.
[01:42:46.155 --> 01:42:51.480]  And it is absolutely amazing what they allowed her to get away with and how they persecuted you.
[01:42:52.161 --> 01:42:55.828]  Inappropriately in the wrong court, the same people who gave her a pass.
[01:42:55.868 --> 01:42:59.795]  Thank you so much for joining us, Christian Saussure, and best luck to you, sir.
[01:42:59.876 --> 01:43:00.156]  Thank you.
[01:43:06.564 --> 01:43:13.151]  We've got a bunch of specials running right now that are, in some cases, the biggest we've ever had.
[01:43:14.032 --> 01:43:16.515]  Because I want people to experience how good these products are.
[01:43:16.555 --> 01:43:22.442]  Because we're being censored, because we're being attacked, I ran a bunch of products 50% off, like the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:43:22.942 --> 01:43:33.948]  Like the bodies ultimate turmeric formula and others those sold out So we've got 20% off on super high quality body armor including backpack inserts that are so important to yourself and your children This is something just out around town.
[01:43:33.988 --> 01:43:34.349]  You name it.
[01:43:34.369 --> 01:43:38.811]  It's good to have also We've got 30 to 80 percent off site-wide now
[01:43:38.871 --> 01:43:48.558]  Massive limited time savings as part of this Operation Paul Revere to defend the First Amendment, to defend internet freedom, and of course, on top of all of that, we're going to do this so we can defend the Second Amendment.
[01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:55.423]  We need your financial support, so if you need water filtration, air filtration, you name it, it's all 30 to 80% off, almost all items.
[01:43:55.443 --> 01:44:02.568]  There's a few things where we're making like 30% profit on food, you can't 30% off or it's at cost, and they won't even let you do that.
[01:44:02.708 --> 01:44:05.650]  So there's a few things in there that are regular price, because they're already so low.
[01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:09.613]  But we already only mark stuff up at regular sell price at a 100% markup.
[01:44:09.653 --> 01:44:10.614]  But we're never at 100%.
[01:44:10.654 --> 01:44:12.935]  We're usually at about 50% off markup.
[01:44:12.975 --> 01:44:13.936]  So we're talking 50%.
[01:44:14.076 --> 01:44:18.399]  Everybody else is three, four times markup, and I get it with taxes, regulations, the bureaucracy.
[01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:23.443]  You're running any company, you get lawsuits, you know, just all sorts of, you know, crazy, fake stuff, especially if you're in full war.
[01:44:23.503 --> 01:44:25.444]  So what I'm saying is, we need your support.
[01:44:25.464 --> 01:44:26.145]  We make it easy.
[01:44:27.085 --> 01:44:29.347]  30% off almost all items site-wide to help.
[01:44:29.787 --> 01:44:42.376]  Just very important as an independent voice here.
[01:44:42.416 --> 01:44:50.742]  You know, over the last several years, your organization and mine have both become very, very mainstream producers of many health-enhancing products.
[01:44:50.802 --> 01:44:55.225]  And I gotta say, the value of what you're offering people is quite extraordinary.
[01:44:55.245 --> 01:44:58.728]  Because if they go into a retail channel, there's so much markup in the retail channel.
[01:44:59.188 --> 01:45:01.729]  That the ingredients have to be really, really cheapened.
[01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:05.170]  If it's, you know, at a Whole Foods or at a grocery store or something like that.
[01:45:05.951 --> 01:45:10.492]  The value of the ingredients that you're putting in because you're selling directly to people is really extraordinary.
[01:45:11.133 --> 01:45:16.695]  I know I've got some of your products in our lab that we're looking at and the potency that we're seeing right now is just super high.
[01:45:17.675 --> 01:45:23.438]  I mean, I know you didn't have me here to endorse your product line, but... No, I appreciate you doing it, because I... I mean, look, I know where to target.
[01:45:23.498 --> 01:45:24.498]  Plus, I want to sell good stuff.
[01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:27.620]  We used to go out to the industry leaders and say, what's the strongest turmeric out there?
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.962]  Well, 450 milligrams with a 90-something curcumin and... I mean, you're an expert in all this.
[01:45:33.002 --> 01:45:34.403]  That's as high as the industry gets.
[01:45:34.703 --> 01:45:35.323]  We go with that.
[01:45:35.343 --> 01:45:38.565]  A lot of folks, as you said, they're going to want to mark stuff up six, seven times.
[01:45:38.585 --> 01:45:40.006]  They want it to be low-priced.
[01:45:40.026 --> 01:45:42.587]  So it's 30 bucks, but there's a dollar of product.
[01:45:43.007 --> 01:45:44.388]  Not, you know, $10 a product.
[01:45:44.408 --> 01:45:45.129]  We see that all the time.
[01:45:45.429 --> 01:45:45.910]  All the time.
[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:54.277]  And it's the curcuminoids, and if you, you know, there's so much amazing scientific research and medical research out there on so many of the benefits of curcumin.
[01:45:54.717 --> 01:45:56.719]  You know, I think we published stories today on that.
[01:45:57.179 --> 01:46:01.603]  You know, for sports, for fitness, for recovery, for... There's a lot we're not supposed to say, but it's known.
[01:46:01.663 --> 01:46:02.083]  Exactly.
[01:46:02.144 --> 01:46:03.044]  There's things we can't say.
[01:46:03.124 --> 01:46:03.765]  Both of us can't say.
[01:46:03.785 --> 01:46:04.506]  Because the country's so free.
[01:46:04.606 --> 01:46:04.766]  Yeah.
[01:46:05.086 --> 01:46:09.810]  You know, there's thousands of studies of what it does, and it's the ultimate antioxidant.
[01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:11.672]  And so, look, it's sold out in a month.
[01:46:11.752 --> 01:46:15.435]  I did 50% off, and we still made, like, you know, $6, $7 a bottle.
[01:46:15.455 --> 01:46:18.197]  Now it's gonna be regular price, and it's still a good deal.
[01:46:18.217 --> 01:46:20.519]  But I want folks to see how good it is.
[01:46:20.539 --> 01:46:23.202]  So, you know, that's sold out.
[01:46:23.242 --> 01:46:24.603]  The point is, is that we've got
[01:46:25.163 --> 01:46:27.044]  Uh, clearance, apparel, 80% off.
[01:46:27.385 --> 01:46:28.485]  Treeway, 50% off.
[01:46:28.906 --> 01:46:30.527]  Aegis body armor, 20% off.
[01:46:30.887 --> 01:46:33.989]  InfoWars life, mind and body, uh, that is 40% off.
[01:46:34.069 --> 01:46:35.390]  And I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:46:35.851 --> 01:46:44.517]  All I'm saying is, please support the broadcast and take advantage of this and let the globalists know no matter how hardcore their attacks are, you're gonna continue to support us because they just...
[01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:49.378]  They just had a big site yesterday claiming they weren't sponsoring us anymore, and they never sponsored us.
[01:46:49.658 --> 01:46:53.399]  If they were trying to get other sponsors to pull, it was a total hoax.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:53.860]  Of course.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:54.940]  That's what they do all the time.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.300]  It's all a disinfo war.
[01:47:05.523 --> 01:47:08.124]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:28.342 --> 01:47:41.614]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight, and we're talking to Christian Saussure, the man who was pardoned yesterday by President Trump, who tweeted out yesterday, congratulations to Christian Saussure, a man who served proudly in the Navy, on your newly found freedom.
[01:47:42.375 --> 01:47:46.298]  No more ankle bracelet, no more pardon, no more parole, rather.
[01:47:46.578 --> 01:47:47.299]  He has now been pardoned.
[01:47:47.319 --> 01:47:49.681]  He says, now you can go out and have the life you deserve.
[01:47:49.701 --> 01:47:53.805]  So we want to talk to Christian, and he graciously agreed to stay with us one more segment.
[01:47:54.065 --> 01:48:01.930]  We want to find out what his plans are now that he has had his record cleared to a large extent by President Trump's pardon.
[01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:07.053]  He pointed out that he still has the issue of VA benefits because of the discharge.
[01:48:07.553 --> 01:48:19.640]  Before we get back to Christian, real quickly, I haven't talked about our sales we have because it's vital to keep InfoWars going as we've got CNN and YouTube trying to shut down free speech and shut down InfoWars specifically.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:29.793]  We had the Paul Revere 2018 specials that we have extended 30 to 80% across the board at our site, plus free shipping right now.
[01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:33.017]  We have some of our most popular products 50% off.
[01:48:33.057 --> 01:48:34.159]  Here are some of those.

[01:48:37.843 --> 01:48:41.166]  It's this time of year, folks, where your sciences are under attack by pollen.
[01:48:41.186 --> 01:48:42.647]  50% off of that.
[01:48:42.747 --> 01:48:44.248]  Immune wall, 50% off.
[01:48:44.688 --> 01:48:46.230]  Real red pill, 50% off.

[01:48:58.299 --> 01:49:06.885]  Made in the U.S., non-GMO, and you can even reseal the packages after you've opened them to use them for another couple of days after you've broken that
[01:49:07.005 --> 01:49:16.490]  But it's a great way, right now, when it's 40% off, a great way to get your food set aside in case of emergency or in case of a massive spike in food prices.
[01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:17.731]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[01:49:17.871 --> 01:49:18.771]  It's an uncertain world.
[01:49:19.192 --> 01:49:20.853]  But we certainly do appreciate your support.
[01:49:21.333 --> 01:49:24.174]  And take a look at the sales we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:27.116]  30 to 80% off, plus free shipping.
[01:49:27.176 --> 01:49:30.218]  And that is storewide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:30.358 --> 01:49:32.859]  All right, let's go back to Christian.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:45.051]  As we've seen back in January the 2nd, we had President Trump tweeting out at that point in time, saying Crooked Hillary's top aide Huma Abedin has been accused of disregarding basic security protocol.
[01:49:45.071 --> 01:49:47.834]  She put classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents.
[01:49:48.194 --> 01:49:49.395]  No problem for any of that, right?
[01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:52.178]  He said, remember the sailors picture on a submarine?
[01:49:52.759 --> 01:49:56.443]  Jail the Deep State Justice Department must finally act.
[01:49:57.163 --> 01:49:58.684]  Also, on Comey and others.
[01:49:58.744 --> 01:50:02.365]  So, I personally, I can't imagine how you felt.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:06.026]  Because when I saw James Comey do that, it made my blood boil.
[01:50:06.646 --> 01:50:12.408]  To say that she'd commit all these felonies, but she was going to be let loose, but don't you try this at home, and then sending you to jail.
[01:50:12.768 --> 01:50:15.829]  And that was about a month before your jail term began, wasn't it?
[01:50:16.993 --> 01:50:22.936]  Yes, I'd already pled guilty and accepted responsibility and I was basically just waiting to go to prison at that point.
[01:50:24.277 --> 01:50:26.618]  And I just was utterly disgusted.
[01:50:26.658 --> 01:50:30.300]  I watched it live on television while I was wearing an ankle monitor out on a $100,000 bail.
[01:50:34.341 --> 01:50:37.867]  I just, I sat there with my wife and I didn't know I was speechless.
[01:50:39.028 --> 01:50:47.181]  I can't answer because I was speechless watching it with my wife and I wasn't under threat of a jail term for a very, very minor charge compared to what Hillary did.
[01:50:47.799 --> 01:50:50.180]  Yeah, I mean, and I couldn't believe it.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:57.321]  You know, it'd be one thing if this happened years apart from my case and they, you know, maybe forgot about it or something like that, but it was happening at the exact same time.
[01:50:57.341 --> 01:51:08.324]  These are the same federal prosecutors, the same FBI, the same people that went after me with the greatest of fervor, destroyed my life, destroyed my family's life, bankrupted us, and
[01:51:09.403 --> 01:51:12.427]  And now they're giving this person, Hillary Clinton, a benefit of the doubt.
[01:51:12.468 --> 01:51:15.953]  Somebody who's one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington.
[01:51:16.113 --> 01:51:16.754]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:17.074 --> 01:51:17.435]  Globally.
[01:51:17.495 --> 01:51:24.485]  And somebody like me who's proudly served their country for 11 years and has a stellar military record just demolished by these people.
[01:51:26.307 --> 01:51:27.208]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:51:27.768 --> 01:51:30.230]  I said, this is, people have got to be upset about this.
[01:51:30.731 --> 01:51:38.357]  And I, you know, it's upsetting that the left wants to protect her so much and without even taking a look at the facts, you know.
[01:51:38.777 --> 01:51:44.642]  I mean, you know, her and Obama weaponized the Department of Justice against me.
[01:51:45.462 --> 01:51:54.209]  They used me as a scapegoat to say, look, we're hard on people that mishandle classified information, unless you're, of course, you know, a politically connected elite that's, you know, the current president.
[01:51:54.989 --> 01:52:02.553]  Yeah, that was the thing that made me so angry.
[01:52:02.673 --> 01:52:06.536]  It was basically, she's too big to jail, but don't you try this at home.
[01:52:06.816 --> 01:52:09.657]  And then using you as the poster child for that.
[01:52:10.157 --> 01:52:10.878]  That was just amazing.
[01:52:11.678 --> 01:52:18.519]  I mean, you could go on and on about the Tarmac meeting and everything like that, all these things that should have pointed to a corrupt Department of Justice.
[01:52:19.959 --> 01:52:23.940]  And, you know, just everybody just says, well, you know, it's business as usual in D.C.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:34.302]  And, you know, thank goodness we have Trump there now, because, I mean, President Trump, he's like a one-man wrecking crew destroying the establishment of corruption that's been in D.C.
[01:52:34.322 --> 01:52:35.862]  for so long, and they hate it.
[01:52:36.262 --> 01:52:38.223]  And I just, I love watching him do it.
[01:52:38.243 --> 01:52:40.223]  I mean, you know, it's just,
[01:52:40.943 --> 01:52:50.967]  And I love watching him squirm on CNN and all these other fake news networks and say, well, but, but, but he's done nearly everything that he promised he was going to do in such short order.
[01:52:51.267 --> 01:53:00.570]  I mean, mine is just one of the minor things, you know, my pardon and restoring my good name is just one of the many things that he's done right so far that he promised he was going to do.
[01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:02.371]  And they don't know how to respond to it.
[01:53:02.931 --> 01:53:08.494]  And, you know, it's sad, frankly, because he doesn't get the credit he deserves.
[01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:09.555]  He's an amazing man.
[01:53:09.895 --> 01:53:14.638]  And after speaking to him on the phone, I just reinforced everything I'd already believed about him from watching him.
[01:53:15.038 --> 01:53:18.120]  Well, you know, the further they go down this path, the more they're just destroying themselves.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:19.941]  Because the American people can see this.
[01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:24.784]  They see the difference between what CNN and others are telling us and the reality of what's going on.
[01:53:24.804 --> 01:53:26.965]  But let's talk a little bit about your life now.
[01:53:27.125 --> 01:53:29.305]  What are your plans going ahead?
[01:53:29.646 --> 01:53:33.606]  You point out they essentially bankrupted you, they made it so that you couldn't get a job.
[01:53:33.646 --> 01:53:38.467]  Now you'll be able to get a job with a pardon, but tell us a little bit about your life ahead of you now.
[01:53:39.568 --> 01:53:43.528]  Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to keep fighting for what I believe is right.
[01:53:43.968 --> 01:53:56.751]  I think that this double standard of justice needs to get exposed and as long as you guys will let me come on your show and talk about it, and I think we need to raise awareness because we shouldn't let this disappear into the abyss.
[01:53:57.131 --> 01:54:04.355]  Like so many other, you know, liberal conspiracies or whatever that have just kind of said, well, you know, it's no big deal.
[01:54:04.756 --> 01:54:07.277]  I think we should keep pushing the issue and I intend to do that.
[01:54:07.597 --> 01:54:08.238]  I agree.
[01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:22.086]  I think that basically what should happen, don't you agree, Christian, that what should happen is, you served a year in jail, I think that was excessive, but I think what should happen is Hillary should go to prison and then when she gets out he can pardon her so she can get an honest job somewhere.
[01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:25.053]  Yeah.
[01:54:25.173 --> 01:54:26.755]  I don't know if she knows what that word is anymore.
[01:54:27.556 --> 01:54:29.579]  But I think, yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:37.832]  I think that Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, James Comey, all the other people that were involved in this conspiracy, Loretta Lynch,
[01:54:38.627 --> 01:54:42.390]  And probably Obama as well, should be put on trial.
[01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:45.992]  And they should be tried and run through the same legal system that I was.
[01:54:46.032 --> 01:54:52.056]  Obviously they'll have a lot more funds to throw at legal defense than I did, but I think they should be put through the same ringer.
[01:54:52.416 --> 01:55:01.842]  Because whether they get convicted or not, or sent to prison or not, there should be no reason that people in America believe that there's people in this country above the law.
[01:55:02.502 --> 01:55:03.663]  It should not exist.
[01:55:03.864 --> 01:55:08.408]  She should be held to, and we said this from the beginning, she should be held to a higher standard.
[01:55:08.848 --> 01:55:21.380]  Because she was in a much higher office, she had access to much higher classified material that was, as you pointed out, you know, the very definition of confidential is that it isn't going to damage anything with national security if it gets out.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:26.865]  And I had a job at one point in time as an intern when I was in engineering.
[01:55:27.265 --> 01:55:32.548]  It didn't take very much investigation for me to get a confidential job classification so I could start that job.
[01:55:32.788 --> 01:55:37.650]  It's a very minor thing, something that is classified as confidential, as I pointed out before you came on.
[01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:42.732]  When we saw the House memo come out that had been classified as top secret, there was nothing in there!
[01:55:42.752 --> 01:55:56.839]  I mean, they over-classify things to the nth degree, and yet Hillary Clinton, with stuff that really did need to be classified, that would really damage our country, was out there carelessly, if not deliberately, putting this stuff out.
[01:55:57.674 --> 01:56:10.043]  Well, and then you see the FBI and, you know, Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok, just, you know, this cabal of ensuring that Hillary Clinton never went to any kind of, went through any kind of a legal process at all.
[01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:13.486]  You know, she gets the special treatment by these guys, the white glove treatment.
[01:56:14.066 --> 01:56:14.286]  Why?
[01:56:14.726 --> 01:56:17.967]  Why should anybody in this country be treated differently than anybody else?
[01:56:18.148 --> 01:56:20.588]  We're all supposed to be protected under the law the same way.
[01:56:21.329 --> 01:56:25.270]  We're all supposed to receive equal protection under the constitutional law of this country.
[01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:30.152]  And those people, the organizations like the FBI and the DOJ should be above reproach.
[01:56:30.492 --> 01:56:35.113]  There should be no insider, well we're going to do this or we're going to treat this person this way.
[01:56:35.133 --> 01:56:37.154]  No, it's shameful.
[01:56:37.614 --> 01:56:39.615]  It's shameful that that was at the highest levels.
[01:56:39.975 --> 01:56:50.245]  I agree, and there's another aspect to this, Christian, and that is the fact that, and it's something that I'm especially sensitive to as a journalist, and that is the lack of transparency in our government.
[01:56:50.886 --> 01:57:00.616]  Everything, like I mentioned, the memo that was eventually declassified, even though it was top secret, Trump declassified that, and you could see there was nothing in there that needed to be even confidential classification.
[01:57:01.456 --> 01:57:08.660]  And we see the government always hiding everything that it does from us under the, well, we can't tell you because it would damage national security.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:16.444]  It's just, they're just protecting themselves and hiding all transparency from us and doing it in the name of the national security state.
[01:57:16.644 --> 01:57:22.247]  And then we see when it is real national security, they don't care one bit and they won't punish anybody for it.
[01:57:22.307 --> 01:57:23.608]  That's the thing that really bothers me.
[01:57:24.554 --> 01:57:24.674]  Yep.
[01:57:25.034 --> 01:57:26.435]  But thank you so much for joining us.
[01:57:26.775 --> 01:57:31.618]  And again, if you want to help Chris, I'm sure that he needs some help with his legal fees.
[01:57:31.798 --> 01:57:34.479]  And of course, there are other things to come after this.
[01:57:34.519 --> 01:57:37.321]  You can go to helpchrissaucier.com.
[01:57:37.341 --> 01:57:43.284]  That's K-R-I-S-S-A-U-C-I-E-R, helpchrissaucier.com.
[01:57:43.324 --> 01:57:44.584]  Thank you so much for joining us, Chris.

[01:57:46.645 --> 01:57:46.966]  Thank you.
[01:57:47.186 --> 01:57:47.526]  Thank you.

[01:58:02.037 --> 01:58:09.402]  Spike himself just sought to make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford.
[01:58:10.243 --> 01:58:14.986]  And that's why Pipe Hitters Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well.
[01:58:15.286 --> 01:58:17.047]  We wanted to put out a line of rifles.
[01:58:17.548 --> 01:58:20.530]  We wanted rifles that were high quality,
[01:58:21.190 --> 01:58:25.311]  That were combat rated that we could like put our name on and really stand behind.
[01:58:25.451 --> 01:58:30.953]  So we looked around at quite a few companies and to be quite honest, it was an easy decision to make.
[01:58:31.293 --> 01:58:34.754]  Spikes Tactical is a small family owned business.
[01:58:35.154 --> 01:58:36.415]  They stand behind their products.
[01:58:36.635 --> 01:58:39.236]  As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee.

[01:58:49.839 --> 01:58:53.320]  We're also 100% American-made.
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:56.021]  They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:58.442]  They are strong supporters of the military.
[01:58:58.522 --> 01:58:59.743]  Spike gives back a lot.
