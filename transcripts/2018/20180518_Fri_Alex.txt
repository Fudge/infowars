[00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.630]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.294]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.396]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:35.399]  We are broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:50.310]  Our crew is already on the road to South Texas, just south of Houston, just north of Galveston, Texas, where now at least 10 people are dead, including students and reportedly faculty and one wounded, perhaps dead, police officer.
[00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.432]  We're getting conflicting reports.
[00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:54.073]  Obviously, our prayers go out to everybody.
[00:00:54.073 --> 00:01:00.338]  This is a gigantic, sprawling high school in a suburb of Houston.
[00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.762]  And of course, you've got rescue helicopters, you name it there.
[00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:11.505]  This has really, really turned out to be a terrible event.
[00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:20.912]  About two hours ago when it first started, I was watching Fox and they weren't even sure anyone had been injured for a good 30 minutes, so they cut away from coverage.
[00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:25.695]  But I talked to Pat Riley, who works with us, and he's got family in the town.
[00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.977]  In fact, he's got family that works in association with the school.
[00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:33.239]  And he was saying that it was a school shooting.
[00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.399]  And so I jumped right on that immediately.
[00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.060]  And by then it was two dead, four dead, six dead, eight dead, ten dead, and growing.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.281]  A true tragedy.
[00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:45.621]  And you know the gun grabbers are going to seize on this.
[00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:47.702]  They're going to blame all gun owners in America.
[00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:50.022]  They're going to misrepresent what we say about it.
[00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:54.023]  We know that the coward of Broward County, the head school resources officer,
[00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:02.635]  He just retired officially and began receiving $8,000 plus a month.
[00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:05.497]  We saw a stand down in Sandy Hook as well.
[00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:06.777]  Was there a stand down here?
[00:02:06.777 --> 00:02:07.717]  Doesn't sound like it.
[00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:09.798]  One officer is down.
[00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:21.563]  Reportedly there's only a couple school resource officers for this gigantic 5A sprawling school, one of the biggest in the state of Texas, in a bedroom community of Houston.
[00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:26.025]  Again, coward deputy who stayed outside during Parkland school shooting.
[00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:32.674]  New York Daily News reports receives $8,700 a month pension.
[00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:34.136]  Unbelievable.
[00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:38.002]  Now, our hearts go out to those that are wounded and those that are dead and their families.
[00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.706]  But remember, 10,000 plus die a year in swimming pools.
[00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:47.346]  Tens of thousands die falling down on wet pavement or in their bathrooms.
[00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:56.873]  56 people on average, if you average the numbers out from 1990 till now, and the numbers about flat, still too many, but the numbers still flat.
[00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:01.837]  It's less than 60 people die in school shootings, period, every year.
[00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:02.678]  It's a terrible thing.
[00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:16.492]  But the way the media seizes on it and the issues of the kids with their hands up and the hours of waiting and not going, not knowing what's going on, it tears the guts out of a parent.
[00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:24.401]  I know I've got four children and it just makes me know that despite the fact there's some pretty good public schools in some areas of this country,
[00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:37.288]  I would not send my children to public school, because this is where the media advertises that you go kill people if you want to have death by cop, or if you want to go out and be infamous.
[00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:41.772]  Then they hype it and turn it into the number one issue in the world, and of course there's going to be copycats.
[00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:48.798]  You know, during the 60s and 70s, there were over 500 bombings in this country, but the media didn't give them attention.
[00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:54.643]  They covered them, but didn't harp on them, because it gave the terrorists the power that they wanted to terrorize.
[00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:57.684]  You're going to see the marches.
[00:03:57.684 --> 00:04:00.546]  You're going to see it right through as school closes.
[00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:02.327]  I felt like we were running towards the finish line.
[00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:04.328]  I've said this on air just this week.
[00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.510]  For no school shootings in the last few weeks of school.
[00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.890]  And yet, it's happened again.
[00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.034]  Now, statistically, your children are pretty safe in public schools from mass shootings.
[00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:18.316]  50-something a year is too many.
[00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:24.660]  But if you take a country of 330 million people, and what, are there something like 50 million people in school or more?
[00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:32.552]  50-something out of 50-something million, that's one person out of a million in schools is going to get killed.
[00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.875]  It's too many.
[00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:39.578]  But the whole way the media hypes it, like, never one more dead person.
[00:04:39.578 --> 00:04:41.200]  We can't ever have it happen again.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.542]  So when there's another school shooting, they go, see?
[00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.524]  All you gun owners are to blame.
[00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:50.769]  There are even more people dying where you're getting stabbed to death at schools, but the media doesn't cover it.
[00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:54.473]  Now, when we get back, Pelosi has made a sickening statement.
[00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:55.434]  Wait till you see this.
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.916]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:14.165]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:37.763]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, a couple hours ago, I was sitting there getting ready for the broadcast at home, had Fox News on, was on the Drudge Report, was on InfoWars.
[00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:46.733]  And I saw the Fox News anchors cutting away from the news of a school shooting because they couldn't confirm it even happened.
[00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:53.077]  Well, I began to make some phone calls and check local news, and it shows how scripted national news is.
[00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:56.319]  CNN, all of them, it took them over an hour to know what was happening.
[00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.062]  Texas News knew right away that there were multiple dead people, and now it's up to 10.
[00:07:03.243 --> 00:07:05.226]  So it's a real tragedy.
[00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.150]  The governor says he's on his way to Santa Fe High School.
[00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.612]  We'll be brief soon.
[00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:10.994]  Press conference at 1 p.m.
[00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:12.415]  to provide update.
[00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:16.341]  Owen Schroer and more of our crew are loading up as we speak.
[00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.362]  They may have already left.
[00:07:17.362 --> 00:07:19.064]  They were loading up about 15 minutes ago.
[00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:27.157]  To beeline down to the coast, almost to the coast.
[00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:29.319]  In fact, I've driven by this high school before.
[00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.443]  Pat Riley's got family, one of our crew members down there.
[00:07:33.443 --> 00:07:34.845]  He's also in contact with them.
[00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:43.593]  I am going to open the phones up for people that are in that area of South Texas.
[00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:59.462]  We have a computerized phone system, we can even check the caller ID, and we're going to have any eyewitnesses or people that have any information for us to be able to speak out, because we had the same thing with the situation in Parkland.
[00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:02.884]  We had multiple students call in, later confirm their identities.
[00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:07.088]  The media tried to deny it, but later had to confirm they were real, saying that the police stood down.
[00:08:08.032 --> 00:08:09.553]  That is now confirmed.
[00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:17.379]  I don't know that happened here, but we know it happened in all these blue state areas, blue city areas like Sandy Hook.
[00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:20.762]  There was a stand down obviously in Parkland, in Florida.
[00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:23.484]  That's all been confirmed.
[00:08:23.484 --> 00:08:28.268]  I don't know if this was a stand down because you have a police officer that was shot.
[00:08:28.268 --> 00:08:35.474]  That's not really Texas style to stand down, but Houston and surrounding areas are now blue and
[00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:43.259]  We don't know if they fully drummed Texas out of law enforcement in those areas completely, like they've done in L.A.
[00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:50.421]  or Baltimore or areas like Chicago, where we know they stand down and are a bunch of cowards on average.
[00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:51.701]  It's just a fact.
[00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.322]  There are some good peace officers still there.
[00:08:54.322 --> 00:09:01.083]  But this ties into something Nancy Pelosi said just last night that is unbelievable.
[00:09:03.404 --> 00:09:09.870]  We're going to get to that in a moment, but first, up to 10 fatalities confirmed in Texas school shooting.
[00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.055]  Our prayers go out for those that have lost loved ones, those that are injured.
[00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:22.123]  This is a very, very serious situation, obviously, so pray for folks at that South Texas high school.
[00:09:23.387 --> 00:09:33.495]  We will continue to break down the latest as that unfolds, but up to 10 people have been killed at a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas.
[00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:37.978]  Police confirmed that one person is in custody and a second person has been detained.
[00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.100]  A police officer is among those injured.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:49.407]  Speaking to reporters at the scene, a police spokesman said there had been between eight and 10 fatalities, including, and I was watching the satellite feeds we have live, right before we went live, he indeed said that.
[00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:52.434]  Including students and school staff.
[00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:58.158]  A male student has been confirmed as the shooter.
[00:09:58.158 --> 00:10:08.084]  Images from the scene show the extent of the police presence with students lined up outside the premises.
[00:10:08.084 --> 00:10:13.747]  Now, before we go any further with that, this ties into the whole MS-13 situation.
[00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:21.302]  MS-13 is a Central American gang that comes all the way up into Mexico.
[00:10:21.302 --> 00:10:26.566]  It rivals any other Latin American gang for violence and evil.
[00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:33.311]  They're estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Central America, Mexico, and the United States.
[00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:36.353]  They mainly feed on Hispanics.
[00:10:36.353 --> 00:10:41.958]  And to have Trump openly in a video conference that we played yesterday, that we have again to play now,
[00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:52.572]  He's asked about MS-13 by some sheriff's department people, and Trump says, yeah, they're absolute animals.
[00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:53.973]  I don't think that's a strong enough word.
[00:10:53.973 --> 00:10:56.154]  How about monsters?
[00:10:56.154 --> 00:11:00.117]  Who are a total death cult.
[00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.858]  Rivaling people like ISIS.
[00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:04.680]  And the media cut off the front of him being asked about
[00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:11.671]  MS-13 so they can say, Trump just called all border crossers animals.
[00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:17.597]  So that people like Spike Lee can go on TV years later and say that, you know, he said all Hispanics are animals.
[00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:19.219]  Everybody goes, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:21.982]  This is the deception.
[00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:22.863]  This is the garbage.
[00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:27.708]  Well, MS-13 has killed thousands and thousands of people in the U.S.
[00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:32.962]  But when they kill somebody, it hardly even makes the news.
[00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:39.284]  Or, in some cases, juries will just let people off that killed people to virtue signal.
[00:11:39.284 --> 00:11:46.466]  Now, AP and others have had to retract because he was clearly referring to MS-13, not saying border crossers are animals.
[00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:47.987]  I saw Juan Williams on Fox News.
[00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:53.922]  This morning saying that, well, you know, Trump does still mean this and Trump's a bad guy.
[00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.083]  They're going to double down.
[00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:58.247]  But Nancy Pelosi took the cake because all this ties together.
[00:11:58.247 --> 00:12:01.451]  You've got 10 people dead.
[00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:04.455]  With some deranged killer, probably on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:12:05.322 --> 00:12:07.982]  Just like the last shooter in Parkland was.
[00:12:07.982 --> 00:12:09.183]  He'd been under government custody.
[00:12:09.183 --> 00:12:20.405]  He'd been on a crime prevention program because it was racist, they said, to put anybody with a Hispanic last name in jail for burglary, vandalism, death threats, saying he'd school shoot.
[00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:22.025]  He should have been in a mental institution.
[00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.745]  He'd been in government custody.
[00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:26.906]  He'd been in a government facility.
[00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.246]  Look for that again.
[00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:32.647]  Some isolated devil worshipper, drug head, foster care type.
[00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:46.408]  But, again, school shootings in the country, only about 56 on average every year die in a mass shooting at a school.
[00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:53.012]  It's still too much, it's still horrible, it's still terrible, even though 10,000 die, again, in their backyard swimming pools, or in the lake.
[00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:56.234]  Thousands die on boats every year, crashing into jet skis.
[00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.056]  But we don't have those blown out of proportion into the world.
[00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:02.278]  They do on guns, because it can be blamed on gun owners.
[00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:15.148]  They don't magnify what MS-13 does or how many cops they kill or all the methamphetamine they dump on the streets or all the torturing and murder and devil worship.
[00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:17.188]  That's what they're involved in as a cult.
[00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:18.989]  There's no coverage of that to speak of.
[00:13:18.989 --> 00:13:23.410]  But when there's a school shooting, they magnify it to project guilt on everybody.
[00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:30.352]  So, in essence, Nancy Pelosi coming out and saying Trump shouldn't talk bad about MS-13.
[00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:31.833]  We're all God's children.
[00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:34.333]  And Juan Williams said the same thing this morning.
[00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:35.634]  I saw him on Fox News.
[00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:39.536]  What a disgraceful NPR reporter.
[00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:45.981]  By extension, she's saying the shooter that killed 10 innocent people and the number's growing as they fight for their lives.
[00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:51.985]  By extension, she's saying that person's God's children and we shouldn't call him an animal or a monster.
[00:13:51.985 --> 00:13:55.228]  The guy that shot these people is worse than an animal.
[00:13:55.228 --> 00:14:04.374]  He's a monster and a piece of garbage and probably on government-pushed psychotropic drugs because almost every other one of them has been.
[00:14:04.374 --> 00:14:05.275]  So think about that.
[00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:11.409]  Nancy Pelosi is in essence saying, don't call this guy an animal or a monster.
[00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:17.655]  Because she's saying about MS-13, thousands of times worse, conservatively, than this killer.
[00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:18.395]  In the aggregate.
[00:14:19.306 --> 00:14:27.092]  She's saying don't talk bad about them and they're all acting sad because the Democratic Party uses MS-13 to kill people.
[00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:30.495]  I have confirmed this with our law enforcement and army sources.
[00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:39.082]  I've confirmed it with CIA sources that the Democratic Party uses MS-13 nationwide from Chicago to Dallas, Texas, from Austin, Texas to LA.
[00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:50.060]  They use them as their secret army and they know Trump's got a war going against MS-13 and has wiped thousands of them out, arrested thousands more.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.843]  Because what else isn't in the news when MS-13 fights back?
[00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:55.065]  They're getting smoked by the U.S.
[00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:59.349]  military all over this country right now and this Democrat dirtbag's pissed.
[00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:06.016]  Her meth-dealing army is in the crosshairs, you dirty, old, evil, globalist whore selling this country out.
[00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:07.420]  You're a pimp!
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.484]  Sorry, not a whore!
[00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:09.728]  You use us as whores!
[00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:11.013]  Here is the monster pig!
[00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:21.842]  We believe, some of us who are attracted to the political arena, to government and public service, that we're all God's children.
[00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:36.490]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person and as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:46.974]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these aren't people, these are animals.
[00:15:46.974 --> 00:15:51.456]  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity?
[00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:55.118]  So she's saying MS-13 is God.
[00:15:55.118 --> 00:15:56.179]  There you go, MS-13 is God.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.680]  Were you born before the year 1956?
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:09.503]  If so, did you know you could be collecting between $575 and $2,200 in tax-free income right now?
[00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:11.383]  All thanks to the FHA.
[00:16:11.383 --> 00:16:12.564]  Or what about this?
[00:16:12.564 --> 00:16:14.464]  Did you know 54 U.S.
[00:16:14.464 --> 00:16:20.226]  congressmen have used a special tax-free account to earn up to 35 times more on their money?
[00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:22.947]  It's true, and you can do it too!

[00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:02.336]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:41.397]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?

[00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:09.394]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.394 --> 00:18:17.499]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:18.219]  We have now
[00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:48.119]  I'm disappointed.
[00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:51.522]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:51.522 --> 00:18:57.828]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:18:57.828 --> 00:19:00.270]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.853]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:05.095]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:06.235]  We're good to go!
[00:19:23.143 --> 00:19:23.584]  Let's do it!
[00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:42.241]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:52.224]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.885]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:19:54.885 --> 00:20:03.347]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:05.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:32.556]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:32.556 --> 00:20:37.338]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.338 --> 00:20:40.999]  We're in an information war.
[00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:44.100]  We're using the truth and common sense and logic against the globalists.
[00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:55.118]  Nancy Pelosi has come out defending MS-13 saying they're all God's children and that they have a spark of divinity in them, ripping off a line from Mahatma Gandhi.
[00:20:55.118 --> 00:20:59.962]  He said, we all have the seed of the universe within us.
[00:20:59.962 --> 00:21:02.364]  That does not mean the seed sprouts.
[00:21:02.364 --> 00:21:14.313]  And MS-13 is one of the most vile, vicious, torturing groups that even kills women and children when that's not something that flies in Latin America until they came along.
[00:21:14.313 --> 00:21:14.774]  Torture!
[00:21:16.736 --> 00:21:21.459]  Absolute evil, kidnapping people's children.
[00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:25.421]  They rape 80% of the women that they transport into the United States.
[00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:29.984]  They are monsters and they've been caught as the muscle for the Democratic Party.
[00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:34.426]  And I've had military sources on the air.
[00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:36.447]  I've got sources that have been off air.
[00:21:36.447 --> 00:21:38.809]  In fact, I'm going to call some of my sources.
[00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.095]  And I'm going to see if I can actually get them to come on the air.
[00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:45.937]  Some of them have been on the air before, but not said who they've worked for.
[00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:46.897]  Yeah, they've been in the Marines.
[00:21:46.897 --> 00:21:48.038]  Yeah, they've been in the Army.
[00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:54.161]  But they've also done work since Trump got in, in the Central Intelligence Agency, dealing with the Democrats and MS-13.
[00:21:54.161 --> 00:22:00.444]  It is a fact they shipped the guns into Mexico to ship the guns into al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.986]  It's a fact Fast and Furious was about arming MS-13.
[00:22:03.986 --> 00:22:04.927]  All this has come out.
[00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:10.888]  And so Paul Watson just had the big article go live on Infowars.com.
[00:22:10.888 --> 00:22:13.630]  We're in an information war.
[00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.132]  We need to get our talking points out ahead of theirs.
[00:22:16.132 --> 00:22:18.593]  They're going to say gun owners are to blame.
[00:22:18.593 --> 00:22:20.915]  They're going to say the NRA is to blame.
[00:22:20.915 --> 00:22:23.216]  They're going to say I'm to blame.
[00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:29.620]  They're going to try to block us on the internet again like they did a few months ago during the tragic situation in Florida.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.483]  Lying about what we've said and done so that people don't actually hear what we really said.
[00:22:35.475 --> 00:22:40.317]  We're saying they advertise the schools as mass shooting facilities for crazy people.
[00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:52.383]  We're saying in almost every school shooting, I can't find one where it wasn't, a mass shooting where the person wasn't on psychotropic drugs of the Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitor class.
[00:22:52.383 --> 00:22:56.965]  I can't find a time in recent memory where they weren't in some criminal protection racket.
[00:22:57.799 --> 00:23:01.860]  Like the Promise Program, because Cruz had a Hispanic last name.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.321]  He was adopted, he wasn't even Hispanic.
[00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:17.205]  He was let off for four and a half years, threatening to kill people, robbing, stealing, vandalizing and committing crimes, reportedly on a monthly basis.
[00:23:17.205 --> 00:23:21.206]  But they would not put him in jail or a mental institution.
[00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:24.847]  Then his foster parents died, both of them in two years.
[00:23:26.397 --> 00:23:35.501]  He was reportedly living on the streets, or with friends, and he was known as School Shooter Man.
[00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:39.443]  People had been calling 20 plus times, please stop him, he's gonna kill.
[00:23:39.443 --> 00:23:41.204]  The FBI had been called three times.
[00:23:41.204 --> 00:23:43.445]  There was a stand down.
[00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:45.526]  We first had students on that confirmed it.
[00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:46.666]  What did CNN do?
[00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:54.550]  They told YouTube, take our YouTube channel down, that we said nobody died.
[00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:54.710]  So,
[00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:57.402]  They're going to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:58.863]  They're going to blame Trump.
[00:23:58.863 --> 00:24:08.726]  Despite the fact that since 1990, the unified crime statistics are clear, there's an average of 56 people dying, and it's flat.
[00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:13.007]  56 people die in school shootings a year.
[00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:15.228]  Half of them or so are drug-related.
[00:24:15.228 --> 00:24:17.549]  Two or three people get shot.
[00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:20.649]  The other half are these.
[00:24:20.649 --> 00:24:20.870]  What?
[00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.210]  You just saw 14 in Florida.
[00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.351]  It's over 10 here.
[00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:25.471]  A couple others.
[00:24:26.954 --> 00:24:29.035]  The school year is about to close out.
[00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:31.257]  Will it go above 56?
[00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:32.078]  The average?
[00:24:32.078 --> 00:24:34.199]  Probably not.
[00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:35.060]  Is it a tragedy?
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.761]  Absolutely.
[00:24:36.761 --> 00:24:37.982]  Are people fighting for their lives?
[00:24:37.982 --> 00:24:39.343]  You bet.
[00:24:39.343 --> 00:24:42.045]  But swimming pools kill over 10,000 people a year.
[00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.086]  Look it up.
[00:24:43.086 --> 00:24:45.667]  Swimming pools and lakes.
[00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:47.469]  Americans.
[00:24:47.469 --> 00:24:52.292]  More than 10,000 fall on wet concrete or wet tile or in their bathrooms.
[00:24:52.292 --> 00:24:52.813]  More than that.
[00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:57.492]  Gun deaths, 90% of them are suicide.
[00:24:57.492 --> 00:24:58.392]  Did you know that?
[00:24:58.392 --> 00:24:59.934]  Look it up.
[00:24:59.934 --> 00:25:03.577]  Yeah, there's 15,000 gun deaths a year and 90% of them in a whole country of 330 million people.
[00:25:03.577 --> 00:25:04.739]  You got 15,000 and most of it's suicide.
[00:25:17.737 --> 00:25:20.580]  So, the articles on Infowars.com, it's incredible.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.564]  After defending MS-13 murderers that have killed tens of thousands in the U.S.
[00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:28.849]  total, left blames NRA for Santa Fe school shooting.
[00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:33.153]  The NRA is a terrorist organization, the Democrats go on to say.
[00:25:33.153 --> 00:25:35.536]  No, you are a terrorist organization.
[00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.632]  We need to get this article out to everybody and get on the offense.
[00:25:41.632 --> 00:25:44.213]  Infowars.com.
[00:25:44.213 --> 00:25:45.414]  Newswars.com.
[00:25:45.414 --> 00:25:46.714]  Get that article out.
[00:25:46.714 --> 00:25:47.675]  My live feed.
[00:25:47.675 --> 00:25:50.196]  We're on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations.
[00:25:50.196 --> 00:25:57.140]  Tell folks about the station you're watching or listening to so they get an alternative view of what's happening, which is reality.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.081]  Not every gun owner is to blame.
[00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:03.323]  Are truck owners to blame when another ISIS person runs over people?
[00:26:04.642 --> 00:26:06.523]  It happens every few weeks.
[00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:07.584]  It's hardly in the news.
[00:26:07.584 --> 00:26:09.465]  No, the truck's not to blame.
[00:26:09.465 --> 00:26:11.266]  The crazed killer's to blame.
[00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:13.207]  But still, I want to stop this.
[00:26:13.207 --> 00:26:17.349]  The schools are advertised as mass shooting zones.
[00:26:17.349 --> 00:26:19.550]  The schools are advertised where crazies go.
[00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.653]  Why are they always on serotonin reuptake inhibitors?
[00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:25.774]  Why are they always in government custody?
[00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:28.155]  Why are they always being protected?
[00:26:28.155 --> 00:26:31.237]  Why do the police always stand down?
[00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:32.598]  Unless it's Texas.
[00:26:34.232 --> 00:26:38.075]  It appears the police did not stand down here or there would have been 50 dead.
[00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:39.817]  And what happened in Vegas?
[00:26:39.817 --> 00:26:41.779]  That was a gun running operation, not bad.
[00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:43.520]  We first broke it, now confirmed.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.302]  Connected to Fast and Furious.
[00:26:46.302 --> 00:26:52.748]  With Saudi Arabia having a military convention with more than 7,000 people there.
[00:26:52.748 --> 00:26:57.512]  Amazing.
[00:26:57.512 --> 00:27:01.856]  Now, the stories on Infowars.com, it's critical to get out to everybody.
[00:27:03.524 --> 00:27:05.107]  But I want to play this one more time.
[00:27:05.107 --> 00:27:06.369]  This is Nancy Pelosi.
[00:27:06.369 --> 00:27:08.092]  She just joined us.
[00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:11.378]  Yesterday, misrepresenting what Trump said when it was about MS-13.
[00:27:14.093 --> 00:27:16.254]  And she's saying these are all God's children.
[00:27:16.254 --> 00:27:19.075]  In fact, they're a divine spark of life.
[00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:27.079]  So by extension, if she's saying mass murderers are good, is she saying the killer isn't an animal from this Texas high school?
[00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:28.800]  I say he's worse than an animal.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:36.223]  He's a piece of crap, selfish, Prozac head, demon-possessed, sack of garbage, and we don't even know who he is yet!
[00:27:36.223 --> 00:27:40.565]  But I'm willing to say the guy that went and killed a bunch of innocent people is a piece of crap!
[00:27:43.157 --> 00:27:50.000]  How dare you Pelosi say MS-13 mass murderers that kill thousands of people a year in the U.S.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.641]  with guns!
[00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:58.264]  There are a large percentage of the people getting killed, but we don't even know about it because the media covers up for it because we know they work for the Democrats.
[00:27:58.264 --> 00:28:00.625]  They work for this monster pig!
[00:28:00.625 --> 00:28:01.026]  Player!
[00:28:01.026 --> 00:28:01.626]  Go ahead, player!
[00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:12.115]  We believe, some of us who are attracted to the political arena, to government and public service, that we're all God's children.
[00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:26.763]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person and as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[00:28:27.703 --> 00:28:34.167]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these aren't people.
[00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:37.288]  These are animals.
[00:28:37.288 --> 00:28:44.952]  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?
[00:28:44.952 --> 00:28:46.953]  These are not people.
[00:28:46.953 --> 00:28:48.914]  These are animals.
[00:28:48.914 --> 00:28:51.155]  The President of the United States.
[00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:56.638]  Every day that you think you've seen it all, along comes another.
[00:28:56.638 --> 00:28:59.339]  You're a lying sack of garbage, witch!
[00:28:59.339 --> 00:29:02.421]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:02.421 --> 00:29:06.403]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:19.534]  News Analysis Reports It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:19.534 --> 00:33:26.679]  Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree?
[00:33:26.679 --> 00:33:41.089]  I travel the world and the seven seas Everybody is looking for something Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you
[00:33:48.564 --> 00:33:59.849]  Well, our hearts and our prayers go out to the at least 10 people dead at Santa Fe High School between Houston and Galveston, Texas, near the Texas coast.
[00:33:59.849 --> 00:34:05.212]  An area I've driven through many, many times on my way to go fishing or on vacation at the coast with my family.
[00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:08.374]  I've driven by the big high school right there on the side of the highway.
[00:34:08.374 --> 00:34:11.455]  It is a gigantic hospital.
[00:34:11.455 --> 00:34:15.337]  And Trump, early on Eastern time,
[00:34:16.664 --> 00:34:17.685]  About two hours ago.
[00:34:17.685 --> 00:34:21.908]  He said, school shooting in Texas, early reports, not looking good.
[00:34:21.908 --> 00:34:22.889]  God bless all.
[00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.050]  He's also made a brief statement on that.
[00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:34.197]  Well, the usual suspects from the Democratic Party who love to go around demonizing the Second Amendment are out.
[00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:43.805]  And that's the four students picked by the Democratic Party and by the Soros group to go around and give anti-gun speeches after Parkland and to blame all gun owners
[00:34:44.932 --> 00:35:02.105]  Instead of the psychiatric system and the police and the local government and the Promise Program that stood down for four and a half years and protected the Parkland shooter, Nicholas Cruz.
[00:35:02.105 --> 00:35:09.731]  So now Trump's slammed by Parkland survivors over insensitive tweet about school shooting.
[00:35:09.731 --> 00:35:12.874]  So I thought during the break, I said, well, let me see what this insensitive tweet is.
[00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:19.473]  School shooting in Texas, early reports not looking good, God bless all.
[00:35:19.473 --> 00:35:38.008]  Because as of 10 o'clock Eastern Time, as of 10 o'clock Eastern Time, an hour and a half ago, I guess that's two hours ago, they didn't even know if anybody had been killed yet.
[00:35:38.008 --> 00:35:41.011]  We didn't know until about an hour ago.
[00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:43.673]  So again, they take everything the President does,
[00:35:46.567 --> 00:35:53.590]  That's incredible.
[00:35:53.590 --> 00:36:02.495]  They take everything he does, and then they spin it, knowing that hours later, you know there's 10 dead.
[00:36:02.495 --> 00:36:15.041]  And they make it look like, oh my God, he didn't even care about that, because they take an earlier tweet, from 10 o'clock Eastern, and then put it out hours later,
[00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:18.255]  And say, oh look, he's tone deaf.
[00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:20.836]  He didn't talk about the dead.
[00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:22.697]  I was watching television two hours ago.
[00:36:22.697 --> 00:36:25.898]  I talked about that when we first went on air 36 minutes ago.
[00:36:25.898 --> 00:36:32.459]  And I said in the first segment, I was watching and Fox News even cut away because they weren't even sure anyone had gotten hurt.
[00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:35.240]  They said one girl had a bleeding leg.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.161]  I shot a live video and said, well, I hope that's right.
[00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:39.641]  I hope this isn't a big shooting.
[00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:42.042]  And that's what the president was saying as well.
[00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:43.663]  And I'm not here defending the president.
[00:36:43.663 --> 00:36:44.603]  I'm defending the truth.
[00:36:45.123 --> 00:36:50.184]  Just like they have law enforcement say, Sir, MS-13's really killing a lot of people and killing a lot of border agents.
[00:36:50.184 --> 00:36:52.584]  We want to really get more funding to deal with them.
[00:36:52.584 --> 00:36:54.905]  He says, absolutely, they're a bunch of animals.
[00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:57.625]  They cut the question off.
[00:36:57.625 --> 00:37:03.546]  And then Nancy Pelosi comes out and says, they are angels.
[00:37:03.546 --> 00:37:05.747]  They are divine.
[00:37:05.747 --> 00:37:09.127]  They are God's children.
[00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:11.008]  And then how dare Trump talk bad about MS-13?
[00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.013]  Now you can argue I'm doing to her what she did to Trump.
[00:37:15.013 --> 00:37:22.342]  Because she knew full well as of last night what Trump had really said about that and that it was an edited video as usual.
[00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:26.126]  So she chose to imply that he was still saying it about everybody coming across the border.
[00:37:27.153 --> 00:37:32.937]  So in essence, she's saying that MS-13 are a bunch of angels and as pure as the driven snow.
[00:37:32.937 --> 00:37:41.164]  Even though they're the ones raping and killing and torturing the people that come across and leaving them locked up in 18-wheelers if people don't pay double ransoms.
[00:37:41.164 --> 00:37:46.888]  Because they're the muscle of the Democratic Party is MS-13.
[00:37:46.888 --> 00:37:49.450]  And I have that from the highest levels.
[00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:52.944]  Well, here's the latest.
[00:37:52.944 --> 00:37:57.727]  At least 10 dead at Santa Fe shooting in Texas, and possible explosives found.
[00:37:57.727 --> 00:38:02.890]  This out of ABC News.
[00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.372]  At least 8 people they're saying dead, now they're saying 10.
[00:38:05.372 --> 00:38:15.879]  After a student allegedly opened fire at Santa Fe High School in Texas this morning, sending students fleeing for their lives, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the number of deaths could be anywhere between 8 and 10.
[00:38:17.711 --> 00:38:19.553]  Majority being students, Gonzalez said.
[00:38:19.553 --> 00:38:27.359]  The shooting has been contained at the school, has been evacuated, but possible explosive devices have also been found at the school and off the campus.
[00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:31.683]  The school district said authorities are working to render the devices safe.
[00:38:31.683 --> 00:38:37.828]  The district said.
[00:38:37.828 --> 00:38:43.793]  Now I'm not saying this is a false flag and that the whole thing was staged and that the government did it or that
[00:38:45.313 --> 00:38:49.256]  Michael Bloomberg did it, or George Soros did it.
[00:38:49.256 --> 00:39:02.046]  I'm saying, if it turns out the police stood down, like they did in many of these other blue state areas, and this area of Texas is blue state now, Houston and surrounding areas, are total Democrat.
[00:39:02.046 --> 00:39:10.013]  If that comes out, or he was on Prozac, or he was in some catch and release program for criminals like the Promise Program that Nicholas Cruz was in,
[00:39:11.448 --> 00:39:18.591]  Then yet again, they let it happen so they could sit there and shake their finger at the American gun owner and say that we're all to blame.
[00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:23.093]  Because that's what happened in Coward County.
[00:39:23.093 --> 00:39:36.338]  And the head resource officer who stood down while it was going on for 15 minutes, he just got his $8,000 plus a month pension.
[00:39:36.338 --> 00:39:41.200]  And the county has defended the promise program that let Nick Cruz run rampant.
[00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:46.906]  $8,700 pension.
[00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:53.513]  But when we come back, I'm going to lay out some other scenarios because this is perfect timing.
[00:39:53.513 --> 00:39:55.495]  We know Vegas was a false flag.
[00:39:55.495 --> 00:40:01.981]  We know the globalists have been caught staging things, winding people up, protecting them before, and who knows what narrative this could be.
[00:40:02.912 --> 00:40:08.153]  When it's an Islamic attack, like San Bernardino, they cover up that it's an Islamic attack.
[00:40:08.153 --> 00:40:12.974]  The truck attack in New York a few months ago, they said that wasn't an Islamic attack, we made it up.
[00:40:12.974 --> 00:40:17.114]  Even though it was admittedly an attack, he screamed Allah Akbar and has pled guilty to it.
[00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:20.675]  Oh, and they supposedly have the shooter in custody.
[00:40:20.675 --> 00:40:24.436]  Should have added that earlier, at the Santa Fe tragic event.
[00:40:24.436 --> 00:40:27.896]  So, who knows what we're going to find out, but hopefully soon.
[00:40:27.896 --> 00:40:32.177]  But we've got live satellite feeds there from the press conferences we'll be carrying live today.
[00:40:33.513 --> 00:40:50.189]  We'll also, ladies and gentlemen, be on target with our reporters, Owen Schroer and others on the ground, who should be getting there in the next few hours or by the time the war room starts at three o'clock central today.
[00:40:50.189 --> 00:40:57.937]  In about three hours and 20 minutes, they should be getting close down there.
[00:40:57.937 --> 00:40:58.097]  Now,
[00:41:01.741 --> 00:41:04.222]  I've got a lot of other MS-13 quotes here.
[00:41:04.222 --> 00:41:06.324]  This had really blown up the Democrats' face.
[00:41:06.324 --> 00:41:07.784]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:41:07.784 --> 00:41:11.907]  They were losing approval rating points reportedly every hour.
[00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:22.252]  Some polls, some flash polls show a 10% drop just after they got caught trying to claim the President called all Hispanics animals when he was calling MS-13 animals.
[00:41:24.488 --> 00:41:37.402]  And then just right on time, like the cavalry, right towards the end of the school year, another victim disarmament zone mass shooting, and the media will hype the living daylights out of this, maybe they can get another mentally deranged person to go copycat.
[00:41:37.402 --> 00:41:39.263]  If they work hard, maybe they can.
[00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.545]  I pray that's not the case.
[00:41:40.545 --> 00:41:46.851]  But I think if you put your children in public schools that aren't armed like some of these other ones are now, you're insane.
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:51.995]  By the way, I've looked up this school, this was not a let the teachers be armed school.
[00:41:51.995 --> 00:41:53.996]  So that's an angle we should also be looking at.
[00:41:53.996 --> 00:42:00.040]  But make no mistake, right now the talking points are being written, they're being put out to blame the Second Amendment, to blame gun owners.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:10.847]  Boulder, Colorado, just yesterday, or just on Wednesday, two days ago, banned shimmy automatic rifles in high capacity.
[00:42:10.847 --> 00:42:14.210]  So, they're coming for our guns, make no mistake, but whatever you do,
[00:42:15.114 --> 00:42:16.975]  This is an information war.
[00:42:16.975 --> 00:42:28.403]  You're listening on a local radio station, watching on local TV, local cable, on the internet, on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Infowars.com forward slash show, our live feeds.
[00:42:28.403 --> 00:42:35.908]  Share those feeds and say, hey, here's live coverage from Texas of what's really going on there.
[00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:37.629]  Alex Jones is breaking it down.
[00:42:37.629 --> 00:42:39.591]  See what they don't want you to see.
[00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:41.052]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:42:41.946 --> 00:42:43.528]  We'll find out if there's any anomalies.
[00:42:43.528 --> 00:42:45.891]  This may be a straight-up mass shooting.
[00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:47.233]  Probably be a Prozac head.
[00:42:47.233 --> 00:42:52.720]  Didn't get enough attention from Mommy and government protection and some liberal program.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.762]  But it could be more.
[00:42:53.762 --> 00:42:54.383]  We'll be watching.
[00:42:59.918 --> 00:43:00.719]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:10.865]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:19.391]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.391 --> 00:43:28.177]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.253 --> 00:43:49.843]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.843 --> 00:43:52.504]  It is amazing!

[00:47:02.784 --> 00:47:05.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.325 --> 00:47:35.845]  Welcome back.
[00:47:35.845 --> 00:47:39.047]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on this sad Friday edition.
[00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:46.412]  We've got at least 10 dead at Santa Fe High School near the Texas coast, south of Houston by Galveston.
[00:47:46.412 --> 00:47:58.359]  And we've been reviewing police scanner tapes and first reports of what started about three and a half hours ago, about three hours and 15 minutes ago.
[00:47:58.359 --> 00:48:01.241]  And it looks like the police responded pretty quickly.
[00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:03.262]  And one officer was shot.
[00:48:03.262 --> 00:48:03.982]  We're not sure if he's
[00:48:05.768 --> 00:48:08.509]  Alive, we're not sure of the condition.
[00:48:08.509 --> 00:48:11.190]  They're saying there's also some teachers that have been shot.
[00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.951]  The majority of people that were shot and killed are students.
[00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:18.592]  Again, this is the sick society we live in.
[00:48:18.592 --> 00:48:25.094]  School shootings are very rare, but still 56 people killed in school mass shootings a year on average is bad.
[00:48:27.568 --> 00:48:31.731]  Now, MS-13 killing thousands a year is also bad.
[00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:36.034]  Many people, they kill their children, but the media always plays it down.
[00:48:36.034 --> 00:48:40.257]  And when Trump calls them animals, they misrepresent it to demonize him.
[00:48:40.257 --> 00:48:47.923]  And Nancy Pelosi comes out and says that they are God's children and have divine souls.
[00:48:47.923 --> 00:48:51.025]  Very, very sick.
[00:48:51.025 --> 00:48:54.848]  Will she say of whoever this supposed shooter is who they say they have in custody?
[00:48:56.954 --> 00:49:02.317]  Well, they say that he has this divine soul.
[00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:05.059]  Now, they're reportedly looking at explosives at this individual's home.
[00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:07.701]  They reportedly have somebody else in custody.
[00:49:07.701 --> 00:49:11.323]  They reportedly also found what they believe are explosives at the school.
[00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:18.688]  So this sounds like Columbine 2.0 from what we saw 19 years ago.
[00:49:18.688 --> 00:49:21.070]  Owen Schroyer and some of our crew are
[00:49:22.205 --> 00:49:29.190]  Hightailing it down to South Texas, Southeast Texas, as we speak.
[00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:34.113]  They should be there by the time the war room kicks off today.
[00:49:34.113 --> 00:49:47.442]  So we'll have a round table of our crew, myself and others in there when he gets there to give us live coverage on the ground.
[00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:48.363]  Now that said,
[00:49:50.905 --> 00:50:10.748]  This appears to not be a stand down preliminarily, like we saw in Vegas, like we saw in Parkland, and like we also saw then in some of the other events around the country.
[00:50:16.184 --> 00:50:22.526]  So we will track this as it all unfolds today.
[00:50:22.526 --> 00:50:25.726]  I also intend to open the phones up in the next hour.
[00:50:25.726 --> 00:50:29.407]  That's only seven minutes away.
[00:50:29.407 --> 00:50:34.589]  Specifically for people that are Santa Fe, Texas students.
[00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:35.449]  It's a huge high school.
[00:50:36.377 --> 00:50:40.279]  Who are parents or who are family members or witnesses that live in the town.
[00:50:40.279 --> 00:50:47.401]  Every time we do this, if the rest of the callers won't call, please, we'll be able to get them on the line.
[00:50:47.401 --> 00:50:48.742]  We don't usually activate it.
[00:50:48.742 --> 00:50:53.884]  We have a computerized phone system that can take thousands of calls at a time, but we have caller ID.
[00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:55.905]  We'll be able to know if you're calling from that area code.
[00:50:56.798 --> 00:51:02.521]  Also, in the past when we had students on, we made them send us their IDs.
[00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:11.567]  We did this with some of the students we had on during Parkland, and CNN and Snopes said they were actors that we had brought in.
[00:51:11.567 --> 00:51:14.048]  Now, days later, they retracted it and said, no, those are real students.
[00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:16.650]  So, they can claim that we've got actors on,
[00:51:17.844 --> 00:51:27.530]  But if we even point out that they've gotten people from the school acting club to be the anti-gun spokespersons, they then try to have us, quote, kicked off the air.
[00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:28.651]  Again, misrepresenting.
[00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:30.592]  Didn't say they were crisis actors.
[00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:33.734]  Didn't say that nobody died.
[00:51:33.734 --> 00:51:42.240]  We had three local news reports and eyewitnesses on the show who said there was a police stand-down now confirmed.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.761]  It also came out from our sources.
[00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:56.678]  That he had been in a crime prevention program, an anti-racism program, where if you are not white, you don't go to jail for committing crimes, most times.
[00:51:56.678 --> 00:51:58.239]  He was part of the Promise Program.
[00:51:58.239 --> 00:51:59.920]  And by the way, he was white.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.564]  But he was adopted by a lady that had the last name Cruz.
[00:52:04.564 --> 00:52:06.945]  Now there it is, Sun Sentinel.
[00:52:06.945 --> 00:52:13.750]  School program allowed people like Cruz to commit crimes and not get in trouble.
[00:52:16.305 --> 00:52:20.528]  It truly is unbelievable.
[00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:25.511]  They say they don't let it slide.
[00:52:25.511 --> 00:52:35.838]  But meanwhile, the anti-gunners are on the news saying Trump's tweet, at least an hour before the number of dead was even known, was insensitive.
[00:52:35.838 --> 00:52:45.624]  Senate 10 Eastern, when it wasn't even known if anybody was dead, they said it was insensitive because Trump
[00:52:46.806 --> 00:52:49.187]  Was nebulous and said school shooting in Texas.
[00:52:49.187 --> 00:52:50.887]  Early reports not looking good.
[00:52:50.887 --> 00:52:53.028]  God bless all.
[00:52:53.028 --> 00:52:54.268]  Yeah, school shooting.
[00:52:54.268 --> 00:52:55.368]  Early reports not looking good.
[00:52:55.368 --> 00:52:56.508]  God bless all.
[00:52:56.508 --> 00:52:57.709]  Didn't know it was happening.
[00:52:57.709 --> 00:52:59.569]  Remember the time there was a bombing?
[00:52:59.569 --> 00:53:00.609]  And he said, oh, there's been a bombing.
[00:53:00.609 --> 00:53:01.970]  And they said, oh, you were right.
[00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.450]  It was a bombing, but it wasn't confirmed when you said it.
[00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.871]  Shut up.
[00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:11.532]  So now the usual suspects are swamming the president.
[00:53:13.763 --> 00:53:16.424]  Our children are being murdered and you're treating this like a game.
[00:53:16.424 --> 00:53:19.265]  This is the 22nd school shooting just this year.
[00:53:19.265 --> 00:53:19.765]  Do something!
[00:53:19.765 --> 00:53:26.207]  Yeah, and most of those shootings are drug dealers shooting other drug dealers.
[00:53:26.207 --> 00:53:28.208]  We've had what?
[00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:32.390]  Three real mass shootings where somebody went in to kill a bunch of people?
[00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:36.811]  And in one case, the cop stopped him by the time he'd already shot just one person.
[00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:39.332]  So our prayers go out to everybody.
[00:53:39.332 --> 00:53:40.432]  Let's continue to be vigilant.
[00:53:40.432 --> 00:53:41.733]  It's now time to arm the teachers.
[00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:49.822]  It's now time to not have these places be victim disarmament zones.
[00:53:49.822 --> 00:53:55.170]  Eyewitness described shooter with a sawed-off shotgun at Texas High School.
[00:53:56.107 --> 00:54:00.108]  Well, that'll be the first time they didn't use an AR-15 that the media advertises.
[00:54:00.108 --> 00:54:01.109]  Go shoot schools!
[00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:02.529]  It's what you do if you're crazy.
[00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:04.090]  They're always on Prozac.
[00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.231]  We'll see if this guy's on a Prozac-type drug.
[00:54:06.231 --> 00:54:14.153]  But here's some of the scanner audio from just minutes into it happening, where the few police that were there went in and were calling for backup.
[00:54:14.153 --> 00:54:17.975]  Looking like they had a pretty good response time, unlike Parkland, where they stood down.
[00:54:17.975 --> 00:54:19.115]  Here it is.
[00:54:19.115 --> 00:54:21.036]  A little bit more about what took place this morning.
[00:54:21.804 --> 00:54:22.725]  Santa Fe P.D.
[00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:24.186]  is requesting mutual aid.
[00:54:24.186 --> 00:54:27.788]  There has been a shooting at the high school.
[00:54:27.788 --> 00:54:29.049]  I-31, we're making entry.
[00:54:29.049 --> 00:54:31.951]  We're making entry.
[00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:32.231]  P.D.
[00:54:32.231 --> 00:54:33.192]  Dickinson to Medic 1.
[00:54:33.192 --> 00:54:37.735]  I need you to stage for a shooting at Santa Fe School, 1600 Highway 6.
[00:54:37.735 --> 00:54:44.599]  I need you to stage for a Santa Fe shooting at the school.
[00:54:44.599 --> 00:54:45.780]  I'm going around through the hallway.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.621]  That's me going around.
[00:54:51.297 --> 00:54:52.197]  Okay, so you're listening?
[00:54:52.197 --> 00:54:53.198]  Four shots fired.
[00:54:53.198 --> 00:54:56.959]  Additional shots fired.
[00:54:56.959 --> 00:54:58.099]  Well, go ahead and continue to listen.
[00:54:58.099 --> 00:54:59.119]  We have several shots fired.
[00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:03.780]  Possibly one or two rooms in this area that we're at.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:09.062]  Still have several more shots fired.
[00:55:09.062 --> 00:55:13.863]  606704, we're coming out the front doors.
[00:55:13.863 --> 00:55:15.224]  He's actually shooting.
[00:55:15.224 --> 00:55:16.704]  He's in the art room.
[00:55:16.704 --> 00:55:18.905]  We've got shots fired right now, guys.
[00:55:18.905 --> 00:55:20.105]  We need your help here.
[00:55:21.499 --> 00:55:28.045]  Clear.
[00:55:28.045 --> 00:55:37.734]  Of course, this is from the 9-1-1 tapes and the dispatch's recordings at the news grab, and they show footage later after with the police milling around.
[00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.755]  That was not during the shooting.
[00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:40.357]  The police weren't milling around during the shooting.
[00:55:40.357 --> 00:55:42.099]  We're going to come back and play more of this.
[00:55:43.208 --> 00:55:55.036]  Remember, communists have killed over 100 million people, fascists have killed more than 40 million people, government's total 261 million people according to major university studies just in the 20th century.
[00:55:55.036 --> 00:56:01.360]  School shootings less than 60 a year, still too many, but they're going to hype this and blame the American gun owner.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:09.285]  That's why it's critical to get the facts out and say stop blaming us for what deranged people do and the fact that the media hypes up these schools as mass shooting centers.
[00:56:11.425 --> 00:56:16.130]  We're going to open the phones up here for folks that are in the town.
[00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.152]  For people that have family in the school.
[00:56:18.152 --> 00:56:19.333]  Specifically, here's the number.
[00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:19.533]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:56:19.533 --> 00:56:19.594]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:19.594 --> 00:56:19.674]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:19.674 --> 00:56:20.735]  Please don't forget.
[00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:35.054]  We're going to have Owen Schroer and our crew on the ground there in the next few hours with live coverage as well.
[00:56:35.054 --> 00:56:48.127]  Please spread the live links on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and to InfoWars.com of our live coverage so we can counter the corporate media that's going to try to saddle the American people with this crime.
[00:56:49.295 --> 00:56:53.378]  That's authoritarianism when you say if your neighbor does something illegal, you're to blame.
[00:56:53.378 --> 00:56:59.083]  Guns stop, what, 25 or 26 crimes for every crime they're used in?
[00:56:59.083 --> 00:56:59.843]  We know the facts.
[00:56:59.843 --> 00:57:03.146]  It's good guys and good ladies that stop bad guys with guns.
[00:57:03.146 --> 00:57:06.028]  But they're still pushing, pushing, pushing, saying never one more.
[00:57:06.028 --> 00:57:07.569]  Well, never one more car wreck.
[00:57:07.569 --> 00:57:08.770]  Never one more miscarriage.
[00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.392]  Never one more drowned child.
[00:57:10.392 --> 00:57:11.893]  Never one more house fire.
[00:57:12.233 --> 00:57:14.195]  Never one more stroke.
[00:57:14.195 --> 00:57:16.197]  Never one more stabbing.
[00:57:16.197 --> 00:57:17.838]  Never one more drug overdose.
[00:57:17.838 --> 00:57:20.020]  There's evil in the world.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.523]  It's a spiritual and cultural issue.
[00:57:22.523 --> 00:57:29.049]  And because we have these bad, deranged people, and there is some societal breakdown happening mentally, we all need guns to protect ourselves.
[00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:31.751]  Our hearts and prayers go out to those that have been hurt.
[00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.533]  Whatever you do, spread the live links.
[00:57:34.533 --> 00:57:36.955]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:36.955 --> 00:57:38.216]  Let's get these articles out.
[00:57:38.216 --> 00:57:46.443]  Now's the time for maximum energy to get out front David Hogg and all these other people that are coming for the Second Amendment and who said they openly want to repeal it.
[00:57:46.443 --> 00:57:46.924]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.284 --> 00:57:56.928]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:57:56.928 --> 00:58:04.831]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:07.913]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:58:08.553 --> 00:58:13.218]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:58:13.218 --> 00:58:17.341]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:20.484]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:58:20.484 --> 00:58:25.249]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:58:25.249 --> 00:58:28.292]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:58:28.692 --> 00:58:43.785]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:58:43.785 --> 00:58:45.326]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:58:45.326 --> 00:58:47.568]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:58:50.328 --> 00:58:51.949]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:54.529]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[00:58:54.529 --> 00:59:02.012]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:59:02.012 --> 00:59:12.155]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:59:12.655 --> 00:59:20.497]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:59:20.497 --> 00:59:30.698]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:59:30.698 --> 00:59:32.739]  And this part is most important.
[00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:39.140]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.881]  That means it's clean.
[00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:42.121]  That means it's pure.
[00:59:42.121 --> 00:59:45.022]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:59:45.022 --> 00:59:47.823]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:59:47.823 --> 00:59:53.765]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:59:53.765 --> 00:59:56.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:11.166]  I'm talking to Ted Nugent right now to see if he can come on the broadcast via text.
[01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:15.228]  So I want to get his take on this.
[01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:17.869]  Let me talk to him real quick.
[01:00:30.732 --> 01:00:33.392]  Let me just send him a message.
[01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:36.333]  Yes, anytime in the next three hours, I'm on and no insurers after that.
[01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:40.554]  But right now, 15 minutes from now, whatever works for you.
[01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:42.194]  Thanks.
[01:00:42.194 --> 01:00:45.435]  So we're working on that right now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:47.715]  And there's just so much to get to.
[01:00:47.715 --> 01:00:48.615]  My head is spinning.
[01:00:48.615 --> 01:00:56.716]  A tragic shooting in South Texas, just south of Houston, close to Galveston.
[01:00:56.716 --> 01:00:59.697]  We've got at least 10 dead, reportedly explosives found.
[01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:04.102]  We're opening the phones up for eyewitnesses of the Santa Fe shooting.
[01:01:04.102 --> 01:01:05.763]  10 killed in Texas shooting.
[01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:16.468]  Gunman 17 yells surprise as he bursts into art class with assault rifle, shotgun, and pistol and opens fire before being taken alive as police find explosives in multiple locations.
[01:01:16.468 --> 01:01:19.870]  That's the Daily Mail.
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:25.692]  Infowars.com has live coverage there as well.
[01:01:25.692 --> 01:01:26.973]  It is all unfolding.
[01:01:31.243 --> 01:01:37.948]  We are going to continue to track this as it unfolds.
[01:01:37.948 --> 01:01:44.913]  The toll-free number to join us if you are a witness, or you live in the town, or you have family that's giving you eyewitness information.
[01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:47.274]  Live coverage of at least 10 dead in Texas school shooting.
[01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:50.236]  12 also injured, including officer.
[01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:51.617]  Explosives found.
[01:01:51.617 --> 01:01:53.479]  Infowars.com.
[01:01:53.479 --> 01:01:55.380]  Live coverage.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.621]  And we're in an information war.
[01:01:56.621 --> 01:01:58.202]  Please spread that link.
[01:02:00.003 --> 01:02:04.664]  And then also save the links, Owen, Breaking Live, Multiple Dead at School Shooting in Texas.
[01:02:04.664 --> 01:02:10.026]  Owen Schroer, they've got a live feed as they drive down, but in a few hours they will be there.
[01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:14.687]  Again, the toll free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:19.508]  We're gonna go to break in a few minutes.
[01:02:19.508 --> 01:02:22.529]  We're gonna come back with Rodney Eyewitness from Santa Fe.
[01:02:22.529 --> 01:02:25.430]  Says 150 children took shelter.
[01:02:27.705 --> 01:02:32.849]  So that is all unfolding right now.
[01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:41.536]  I want to go out to break here, though, with just a montage of Pelosi's response to Trump's animal comments.
[01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:46.020]  She knows full well it was about MS-13, so she's saying that they're God's children.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.163]  I guess she means this mass shooter is okay, too.
[01:02:49.163 --> 01:02:54.807]  And then we've also got Trump saying, I will always refer to MS-13 as animals.
[01:02:54.807 --> 01:02:55.488]  Here are the clips.
[01:02:57.984 --> 01:03:06.448]  Some of us who are attracted to the public arena and to government and public service that we're all God's children.
[01:03:06.448 --> 01:03:21.094]  There's a spark of divinity in every person on earth and that we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person and as we recognize our responsibilities with that spark of divinity within us.
[01:03:22.034 --> 01:03:28.498]  And so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, these aren't people.
[01:03:28.498 --> 01:03:31.580]  These are animals.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:39.285]  You have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?
[01:03:39.285 --> 01:03:41.287]  These are not people.
[01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:43.248]  These are animals.
[01:03:43.248 --> 01:03:45.489]  The President of the United States.
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:04:08.945]  Every day that you think you've seen it all, along comes another manifestation of why their policies are so inhumane, and why we have to continue the debate, striving for bipartisanship, with openness about what is at stake and what the choices are, and to be unifying in every way possible.
[01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:12.147]  Calling people animals is not a good thing.
[01:04:12.147 --> 01:04:12.728]  Thank you.
[01:04:12.728 --> 01:04:13.008]  Bye-bye.
[01:04:14.996 --> 01:04:20.979]  Could you clarify the context of your use of the word animal yesterday?
[01:04:20.979 --> 01:04:39.368]  It has nothing to do with this meeting but I'm referring and you know I'm referring to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in and I was talking about the MS-13 and also if you look a little bit further on in the tape you'll see that so I'm actually surprised you're asking this question because most people got it right but I'm saying the MS-13 you don't have that
[01:04:39.548 --> 01:04:44.192]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:18.119]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:20.219]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:24.240]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.421]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best
[01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:33.866]  Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.866 --> 01:05:36.508]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.508 --> 01:05:39.310]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.812]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:50.999]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:55.442]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:16.303 --> 01:06:22.607]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:22.607 --> 01:06:25.509]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:28.911]  Well, the mass shooting just started three hours ago.
[01:06:28.911 --> 01:06:31.412]  An hour into it, we didn't know if anybody was even hurt.
[01:06:31.412 --> 01:06:32.353]  Fox News didn't know.
[01:06:32.353 --> 01:06:35.014]  The President said, wow, you know, looks bad.
[01:06:35.014 --> 01:06:36.335]  A school shooting in Texas.
[01:06:36.335 --> 01:06:37.536]  Early reports not looking good.
[01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:38.697]  God bless.
[01:06:38.697 --> 01:06:44.160]  The anti-gun groups from Parkland, funded by Soros, are now slamming the President as being insensitive.
[01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:46.924]  It's just incredible.
[01:06:46.924 --> 01:06:49.066]  They're already blaming gun owners.
[01:06:49.066 --> 01:06:51.848]  They're already tweeting that we collectively are to blame.
[01:06:51.848 --> 01:06:55.431]  That the Second Amendment must be repealed.
[01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:56.792]  Incredible!
[01:06:56.792 --> 01:06:57.713]  We have 10 dead.
[01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:05.459]  The reported student who's still alive burst into the art studio area and screamed surprise before spraying bullets.
[01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:07.734]  at people.
[01:07:07.734 --> 01:07:12.816]  Now remember, we have 56 people a year, on average, between 46 and 56.
[01:07:12.816 --> 01:07:14.037]  It varies each year.
[01:07:14.037 --> 01:07:17.678]  But not above 60 people a year that die in mass shootings.
[01:07:17.678 --> 01:07:18.879]  And it's still too many.
[01:07:18.879 --> 01:07:24.381]  But thousands die in their backyard pools, thousands on jet skis, thousands falling down their bathrooms.
[01:07:24.381 --> 01:07:27.203]  But they hype it up and they blame gun owners.
[01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:31.665]  But listen, it's still way too many to have one dead student from guns.
[01:07:31.665 --> 01:07:35.547]  And the answer is what the President, what Ted Nugent, and what Wayne LaPierre, and what
[01:07:36.347 --> 01:07:40.912]  Other great patriots like Oliver North have called for arming the teachers.
[01:07:40.912 --> 01:07:46.497]  We're in a race to do this as the MSM advertises schools where every deranged killer should go.
[01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:55.646]  We have Ted Nugent joining us with his live expert analysis, the Motor City madman, obviously NRA board member.
[01:07:55.646 --> 01:07:58.369]  Thank you for coming on, Ted Nugent from tednugent.com.
[01:07:59.065 --> 01:07:59.825]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:04.567]  Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity to speak a little bit of truth, logic, and common sense.
[01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:09.708]  Of course, we are not going to stop praying for the families and the victims.
[01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:11.748]  We are not going to stop praying for America.
[01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:22.751]  We will not stop giving our thoughts and prayers for victims of such evil as the left would like us to do as they scramble to worry about hardware and tools and weapons.
[01:08:22.751 --> 01:08:27.313]  When you came out here, we showed that a shotgun is far more deadly than an AR-15.
[01:08:28.914 --> 01:08:40.769]  And, uh, based on, uh, upcoming reports that I will review and I will share with you as soon as possible, we'll find out what the cadence of fire, what the actual firepower was, what the movement of the perpetrator and the victims were.
[01:08:40.769 --> 01:08:43.593]  But once again, this is not about hardware.
[01:08:43.593 --> 01:08:45.555]  It's about heart-ware.
[01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:46.557]  It's about spirit.
[01:08:47.017 --> 01:09:06.663]  This is a manifestation of a cultural deprivation and the abandonment of accountability and discipline in our world, where it goes right to the heart of what Nancy Pelosi and I painfully witnessed Juan Williams on Fox try to explain how calling murderers, torturers, and rapists of MS-13 animals was not
[01:09:10.211 --> 01:09:12.534]  Proper was hurtful.
[01:09:12.534 --> 01:09:27.049]  When you can have a segment of society like Nancy Pelosi and Juan Williams and so many on the left, there were headlines that we were insensitive and we were cruel and hateful for calling rapists of MS-13 animals.
[01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:32.153]  I mean, you can't begin to explain this stuff, Alex.
[01:09:32.153 --> 01:09:37.056]  So I know that truth, logic, and common sense still propels a quality of life.
[01:09:37.056 --> 01:09:39.477]  In my family, the Nugent family, are independent.
[01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:40.338]  We carry guns.
[01:09:40.338 --> 01:09:42.019]  We have fire extinguishers.
[01:09:42.019 --> 01:09:44.280]  We have spare tires in all our vehicles.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:53.646]  And if we want to stop the slaughter of innocents, one armed security guard for 1,400 students will not cut it.
[01:09:53.646 --> 01:09:56.368]  Somebody write that down!
[01:09:57.228 --> 01:10:04.872]  You have got to have armed security at our schools like we do banks and the airport, and at sporting events and racetracks.
[01:10:04.872 --> 01:10:12.076]  We have to have an armed, prepared, trained security individual, preferably undercover without a uniform on, at
[01:10:12.996 --> 01:10:16.398]  Every entrance of every school in America.
[01:10:16.398 --> 01:10:24.062]  Now I can just hear the hate and vitriol coming my way because I'm recommending more guns when in fact the statistics are inescapable.
[01:10:24.062 --> 01:10:30.106]  I happen to know you can get off-duty police officers bonded certified for $25 an hour.
[01:10:30.106 --> 01:10:31.687]  This is very inexpensive.
[01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:33.008]  It needs to happen now.
[01:10:33.008 --> 01:10:36.910]  The left has advertised schools for lunatics to go kill people.
[01:10:37.426 --> 01:10:37.686]  I don't
[01:10:53.209 --> 01:11:16.368]  Father of the Year at my children's school, because I was in school with my children, and I was armed every time I was in the school with my children, and I would do Father's Day presentations and wildlife education scenarios and the discipline of marksmanship and archery and talk to the kids about how important, critical, clean, and sober it is to have the American Dream.
[01:11:17.555 --> 01:11:30.302]  I know there are parents and teachers and administrators and janitors and coaches out there that not only are ready, willing, and able to be armed to stop evil perpetrators, but they already have concealed weapons permits.
[01:11:30.302 --> 01:11:35.545]  But they're invalid in those arenas where they're the most desperately needed.
[01:11:35.545 --> 01:11:39.828]  Alex, you can't begin to explain this stuff!
[01:11:40.628 --> 01:12:02.502]  We can continue to go on and on and on, and once again, we've proved that it doesn't take an AR-15, and that it's not an assault weapon, and if you use a van, or if you use a machete, or a hatchet in London, or you use a rent-a-car in Manhattan, you can kill whoever you want to kill when people are either comfortably numb,
[01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:03.503]  All right.
[01:12:32.722 --> 01:12:34.174]  It's more bizarre than this.
[01:12:34.619 --> 01:12:36.200]  That's right, Ted Nugent's our guest.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.424]  And I've got coming up, Dale is an eyewitness, says that his son knows the suspect.
[01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.305]  We've got Rodney, eyewitness.
[01:12:44.305 --> 01:12:45.126]  So they're coming up.
[01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:48.828]  A few minutes left with Ted Nugent as we learn more as this unfolds.
[01:12:48.828 --> 01:12:52.390]  We'll hopefully get him back perhaps tomorrow or later this afternoon.
[01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:55.953]  But just looking at the Pelosi clip I played earlier, you're obviously aware of it.
[01:12:55.953 --> 01:13:03.618]  I saw Juan Williams this morning on Fox, you must have been watching the same show I was, saying how dare Trump dehumanize all God's children
[01:13:04.745 --> 01:13:10.407]  Pelosi said MS-13 have a spark of divinity, close quote.
[01:13:10.407 --> 01:13:11.747]  This is next level.
[01:13:11.747 --> 01:13:25.452]  I was told by law enforcement and CIA people that the Democrats actually use MS-13 as muscle for them in their big blue city areas they control and that that's why they're so mad at Trump that he's rolling up MS-13.
[01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.706]  Well, it really is a divided nation.
[01:13:28.706 --> 01:13:32.869]  I just finished a documentary with a gentleman by the name of Steve West that I'll send you the link to.
[01:13:32.869 --> 01:13:35.990]  It's coming out in major release here in the next month or so.
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.031]  It's about a divided America.
[01:13:38.031 --> 01:13:39.872]  Well, you're damn right we're divided.
[01:13:39.872 --> 01:13:46.076]  Those of us that would condemn the MS-13 rapists and murderers and torturers, those of us that would condemn evil,
[01:13:46.576 --> 01:14:02.400]  And that on one side, and then the Nancy Pelosi and the Juan Williams and the New York Times and the MSNBC and the Liberal Democrats on the other side, where they actually think that MS-13 has a spark of divinity!
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:13.002]  I'm telling you, I wrote Wango Tango, which is the funniest, most fun song in the world, but I'm going to write a song about how liberals think that rapists have a spark of divinity!
[01:14:13.002 --> 01:14:15.723]  This is so horrific that if you don't laugh, you'll cry!
[01:14:16.633 --> 01:14:18.434]  I can't even believe it.
[01:14:18.434 --> 01:14:23.457]  But it shows, just like the Liberals sided with the Arab Spring, overthrowing non-radical Muslims.
[01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:25.879]  I mean, they just have gone pure evil.
[01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:28.840]  But like you said, the Democrats have been evil for a long time.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.481]  They're really showing their teeth.
[01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:34.944]  I know you've been pushing for initiatives to have select people, like President Trump's called for.
[01:14:34.944 --> 01:14:36.965]  You've been quarterbacking that at the NRA.
[01:14:36.965 --> 01:14:41.388]  Get select, trained people in the schools armed for no additional cost.
[01:14:41.388 --> 01:14:44.410]  That would make these soft targets hard targets, wouldn't it?
[01:14:45.137 --> 01:15:01.609]  Well, we've proven it just in Illinois, in Dixon, Illinois, just this last week, there was an armed individual, an armed security guard, I don't know if he was uniformed or not, doesn't matter at this point, but he engaged an active shooter, and number of deaths, Alex, zero!
[01:15:01.609 --> 01:15:04.171]  So it's not like you and I have a hunch.
[01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:06.412]  It's not like we have a wild guess.
[01:15:06.412 --> 01:15:08.994]  It's not like we're pulling this out of our ass.
[01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:11.816]  The evidence is irrefutable.
[01:15:11.816 --> 01:15:14.298]  If you are unarmed and helpless,
[01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:18.018]  You are unarmed and helpless.
[01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:24.306]  What a tragic, irresponsible, embarrassing condition to allow yourself to become.
[01:15:24.306 --> 01:15:32.016]  And all I'm saying is that I'm just a guitar player, but I've never been without a pocket knife and a handkerchief and a pen.
[01:15:32.536 --> 01:15:34.138]  They want to domesticate you.
[01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:35.579]  Ted Nugent, I know you've got to go.
[01:15:35.579 --> 01:15:37.021]  This is a three-minute break.
[01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:46.449]  I want to just come back with two, three more minutes with you to ask you where you think the gun grabbers are going, where we need to go to stop them, because you know they're going to come even more now for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
[01:15:46.449 --> 01:15:49.452]  So I want to get an update from you on that fight, and then we'll let you go.
[01:15:49.452 --> 01:15:52.295]  And we've got eyewitnesses from the shooting right after that.
[01:15:52.295 --> 01:15:54.257]  Dale and Rodney, please stay right there.
[01:15:57.782 --> 01:16:02.863]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:08.205]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.

[01:18:11.466 --> 01:18:16.170]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.

[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:18.337 --> 01:20:23.822]  Alright, Dale says his son knows the suspect.
[01:20:23.822 --> 01:20:25.443]  And Rodney is an eyewitness.
[01:20:25.443 --> 01:20:29.987]  We have a lot of obvious listeners in Texas, but every tragic event.
[01:20:29.987 --> 01:20:34.311]  Fortunately, but also unfortunately, we have people right there on the ground.
[01:20:34.311 --> 01:20:36.973]  And we had two students on and three different newscasts.
[01:20:38.556 --> 01:20:41.677]  All reporting a stand-down in Florida.
[01:20:41.677 --> 01:20:49.600]  And now we know, on top of that, that Cruz was on psychotropics, protected for years, part of a promise program that let him out of jail.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.362]  And we're talking burglary, reportedly, vandalism.
[01:20:54.362 --> 01:20:57.443]  He was known as the school shooter, threatening to kill people.
[01:20:57.443 --> 01:20:59.583]  But he was protected by Coward County.
[01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:05.045]  Now, the chief deputy that was over this and stood down that day, he gets $8,700 a month until he dies.
[01:21:08.317 --> 01:21:13.443]  And Ted Nugent, in closing, I really appreciate your time, NRA board member.
[01:21:13.443 --> 01:21:14.203]  You nailed it earlier.
[01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.625]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:19.149]  This isn't a hardware issue, a machete, a truck, a gun.
[01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:22.572]  This is an issue of sick, twisted freaks.
[01:21:22.572 --> 01:21:25.816]  And it's so obvious, and I'm not going to take the blame.
[01:21:25.816 --> 01:21:27.438]  I know you're not, as gun owners.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:38.849]  With the millions of crimes that get stopped every year by law-abiding citizens, I'm not, or the woman in Brazil shooting the guy that's trying to kidnap the kids, you know, that footage from last week.
[01:21:38.849 --> 01:21:44.133]  This stuff never gets picked up by the media, but these tragic events get magnified and then blamed on us.
[01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:48.077]  If my neighbor runs over their wife with a truck, that's not my fault.
[01:21:48.077 --> 01:21:49.278]  I don't get blamed for that.
[01:21:49.278 --> 01:21:52.120]  People would get mad if a guy down the road
[01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:56.025]  Let's say killed his wife with a guillotine, God forbid.
[01:21:56.025 --> 01:22:02.592]  If they came to your door and said, Mr. Nugent, you're to blame because Bill, two miles away, killed his wife, you'd laugh at them.
[01:22:02.592 --> 01:22:07.098]  But why don't we get more angry when they blame us for something that has nothing to do with us?
[01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:21.322]  Well, it's fascinating because after the Parkland students abandoned their grieving and their heartfelt emotion after witnessing such a tragedy there, they turned to hate.
[01:22:21.322 --> 01:22:27.087]  I termed them as mushy-brained teenagers, which I think, Alex, we're all mushy-brained teenagers when we're that young.
[01:22:27.087 --> 01:22:28.508]  We're still absorbing.
[01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:29.389]  We don't know much.
[01:22:29.389 --> 01:22:30.590]  That wasn't a mean statement.
[01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:31.631]  That wasn't an attack.
[01:22:32.271 --> 01:22:37.936]  Just like when the president called MS-13 animals.
[01:22:37.936 --> 01:22:42.119]  And then the left finds fault with calling rapists animals.
[01:22:42.119 --> 01:22:47.944]  So you can't make sense out of the left propaganda ministry.
[01:22:47.944 --> 01:22:50.186]  Well exactly, by the way, animals isn't enough.
[01:22:50.186 --> 01:22:51.287]  How about monsters?
[01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:55.449]  They're pure devils, they're just pure evil.
[01:22:55.449 --> 01:23:03.533]  But I just tweeted, I got my band here, I'm rehearsing, I've got a killer gig right here in Waco, Texas at Tucker Hall on the 26th.
[01:23:03.533 --> 01:23:09.036]  The whole Nugent band is here and we're barbecuing and we're shooting guns and they're gonna be surrounded.
[01:23:09.036 --> 01:23:13.718]  It's right in Waco, Texas at Tucker Hall and you're gonna find the greatest people in the world, they're all
[01:23:14.398 --> 01:23:15.900]  We're good to go.
[01:23:34.372 --> 01:23:42.153]  But liberal feel-good abandonment of accountability and discipline rages on in every instance, Alex.
[01:23:42.153 --> 01:24:02.137]  These murderers have been known to be psychotic, to be dangerous, to be threatening in every instance, from Columbine to Virginia Tech to Luby's Cafeteria to San Bernardino and the Pace nightclub in Orlando and in Parkland.
[01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:02.837]  Every time,
[01:24:03.397 --> 01:24:08.082]  The murders were known to be absolutely dangerous, I predict.
[01:24:08.704 --> 01:24:33.059]  And it really doesn't matter what the prediction is true or not, but I predict that this maniac, this evil, evil person that slaughtered innocent people today in Santa Fe, Texas, he will be discovered to be a known crazy person that in a feel-good, liberal world, you don't identify a crazy person because you might hurt his feelings, and this is the result.
[01:24:33.955 --> 01:24:35.737]  Every time they're on a Prozac type drug.
[01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:36.999]  Every time they're being protected.
[01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:38.140]  Every time there's a stand down.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.922]  And you know, we think of Texas as red.
[01:24:39.922 --> 01:24:41.363]  Houston's blue now.
[01:24:41.363 --> 01:24:42.405]  A lot of great people.
[01:24:42.405 --> 01:24:45.348]  And that area down to Galveston is now blue.
[01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:48.872]  And it's just weird that this seems to always happen in a blue area, Ted Nugent.
[01:24:49.602 --> 01:25:01.052]  Well, the Uniform Crime Report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, not to be confused with the gangsters like Comey and the thugs that run the FBI.
[01:25:01.052 --> 01:25:08.379]  How long would you enter a building that says J. Edgar Hoover over the entrance without feeling guilty and want to change the status quo?
[01:25:08.379 --> 01:25:09.180]  But I digress.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:24.567]  But the crime report from the FBI has proven that in every highest crime zone in America, you look at a map of America, it's almost all red except for little blue high-crime Democrat smudges.
[01:25:24.567 --> 01:25:26.748]  Democrats and liberals will
[01:25:27.428 --> 01:25:45.261]  Are more dedicated to make you feel good than actually doing good and it manifested itself today in Santa Fe, Texas and what Nancy Pelosi and Ron Williams attempted to legitimize MS-13 by condemning those of us that would call them animals.
[01:25:47.122 --> 01:25:52.065]  Rod Serling wouldn't produce a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:54.387]  Mad Magazine wouldn't run this story.
[01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:55.868]  It's so stupid.
[01:25:55.868 --> 01:26:02.033]  But this new... I'm going to send you a copy and a link to this new Division America documentary.
[01:26:02.033 --> 01:26:02.533]  I want to see it.
[01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:02.913]  And you know what?
[01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:05.856]  I think I may bring the family up to that great concert you're putting on.
[01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.497]  Ted Nugent, say hi to Shemay.
[01:26:07.497 --> 01:26:09.138]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[01:26:09.138 --> 01:26:09.498]  You bet.
[01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:12.300]  We're praying for the families down in Santa Fe, Alex.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:12.621]  Absolutely.
[01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:13.061]  Pray for them.
[01:26:13.061 --> 01:26:13.581]  God bless you.
[01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:14.242]  Thank you, Ted Nugent.
[01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:18.231]  All right, there goes Ted Nugent, and I'm going to call him back today.
[01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:22.133]  He'll probably pop back on the other broadcast we have with Owen Schroer, who's going to be in the field.
[01:26:22.133 --> 01:26:25.156]  Now, I apologize to Dale and I apologize to Rodney.
[01:26:25.156 --> 01:26:26.737]  I was going to go right to you.
[01:26:26.737 --> 01:26:27.698]  I sent Ted a text.
[01:26:27.698 --> 01:26:29.699]  I said, hey, can you come on the next few hours?
[01:26:29.699 --> 01:26:30.900]  And boom, he called the hotline.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:31.701]  He's a man of action.
[01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:33.882]  So I was like, OK, we'll have Ted up front.
[01:26:33.882 --> 01:26:35.263]  Obviously, you know why.
[01:26:35.263 --> 01:26:37.085]  So we're going to now go to
[01:26:38.371 --> 01:26:47.376]  Dale, who says that he is a eyewitness down in Santa Fe, where at least 10 are dead, praying for those, obviously lost people, praying for those, fighting for their lives.
[01:26:47.376 --> 01:26:48.877]  This is a real tragic event.
[01:26:48.877 --> 01:26:50.518]  Says his son knows the suspect.
[01:26:50.518 --> 01:26:52.179]  And then we'll go to Rodney after that.
[01:26:52.179 --> 01:26:53.139]  Dale, thanks for holding.
[01:26:53.139 --> 01:26:55.221]  Go ahead.
[01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:55.661]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:55.661 --> 01:26:57.222]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:26:57.222 --> 01:27:02.465]  I'm a longtime listener, first-time caller, Second Amendment supporter.
[01:27:02.465 --> 01:27:06.427]  I have a sophomore that attends Santa Fe High School.
[01:27:07.528 --> 01:27:11.284]  At approximately five minutes to eight this morning, he called me out of breath.
[01:27:12.105 --> 01:27:25.234]  Tell me that there was a shooter at the school at the high school and that he was running down the road to the gas station that's just south of the school about a click.
[01:27:25.234 --> 01:27:32.579]  And so he told me that the fire alarm went off and they all went out of the rooms.
[01:27:32.579 --> 01:27:41.045]  They heard what they thought could have been gunshots, but then they heard two loud gunshots and everybody started running.
[01:27:41.045 --> 01:27:41.586]  And so
[01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:48.346]  He has a brother, too, that eventually met up with him there at the service station.
[01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:58.714]  And I picked him up about a mile off the highway, a mile south of the school, off the highway when I left work to run over and pick him up.
[01:27:58.714 --> 01:28:11.104]  And we were watching a report on CBS where the shooter was named by someone who had seen
[01:28:12.106 --> 01:28:15.149]  I've been a witness to Dimitri.
[01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:16.670]  I don't want to use his last name.
[01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:21.794]  I guess everybody deserves some anonymity, especially minors.
[01:28:21.794 --> 01:28:24.456]  But you're saying CBS said the name?
[01:28:24.456 --> 01:28:25.637]  CBS said the name.
[01:28:25.637 --> 01:28:27.759]  Yeah.
[01:28:27.759 --> 01:28:32.843]  And his first name, Dimitri, and said he was in a trench coat.
[01:28:33.644 --> 01:28:39.906]  And my son said at the house after I had evacuated him, said, I know Dimitri.
[01:28:39.906 --> 01:28:43.287]  He's always talking about guns and knives.
[01:28:43.287 --> 01:28:47.448]  And who wears the trench coat all the time?
[01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:49.089]  It's apparently his M.O.
[01:28:49.089 --> 01:28:51.309]  It's the trench coat mafia devil worship stuff.
[01:28:51.309 --> 01:28:52.270]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.530]  This is critical.
[01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:54.730]  This is absolutely critical.
[01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:55.291]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:56.051]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[01:28:57.779 --> 01:29:02.862]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:02.862 --> 01:29:08.206]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:08.206 --> 01:29:16.271]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:16.271 --> 01:29:21.715]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[01:29:21.715 --> 01:29:23.696]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:23.696 --> 01:29:25.758]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:27.588 --> 01:29:28.409]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:29:28.409 --> 01:29:30.210]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:31.851]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:31.851 --> 01:29:34.673]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:34.673 --> 01:29:36.974]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:36.974 --> 01:29:41.477]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:45.420]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.202]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:49.202 --> 01:29:49.523]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:51.264]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:58.243 --> 01:30:05.865]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:30:05.865 --> 01:30:13.788]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:30:13.788 --> 01:30:16.869]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.509 --> 01:30:22.174]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.174 --> 01:30:26.297]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:30:26.297 --> 01:30:29.440]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.205]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.205 --> 01:30:37.248]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.648 --> 01:30:52.734]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:54.275]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.275 --> 01:30:56.576]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:58.055 --> 01:31:02.038]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.038 --> 01:31:04.801]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:09.585]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:31:09.585 --> 01:31:12.007]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:31:12.007 --> 01:31:15.029]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.217]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:57.796 --> 01:32:08.403]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.403 --> 01:32:10.464]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.464 --> 01:32:13.326]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.326 --> 01:32:14.827]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.827 --> 01:32:17.949]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:21.631]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.631 --> 01:32:23.712]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:33.418]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.418 --> 01:32:45.986]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:46.607]  We're good to go.
[01:33:19.269 --> 01:33:21.390]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:23.351]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:24.972]  For your mind.
[01:33:24.972 --> 01:33:30.635]  My friend got shot in the art hall.
[01:33:30.635 --> 01:33:34.697]  And as soon as the alarms went off, everybody just started running outside.
[01:33:34.697 --> 01:33:37.118]  And next thing you know, everybody looks.
[01:33:37.118 --> 01:33:39.199]  And you hear boom.
[01:33:39.199 --> 01:33:40.060]  Boom, boom.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:44.842]  And I just ran as fast as I could to the nearest forest so I could hide.
[01:33:44.842 --> 01:33:46.403]  And I called my mom.
[01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:55.776]  Now we have Dale and Rodney and others that are eyewitnesses who live there in the town.
[01:33:55.776 --> 01:34:02.300]  This gentleman rescued his sons about a half mile or mile away from the school.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:14.407]  He said off-air to us the name of the supposed shooter, the reported shooter, and now the Metro, one of the big papers in London, has photos of who they purport to be.
[01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:25.456]  Uh, this individual, he has a Greek class name, Demetrius Pag-or-tees, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:32.920]  It's phonetically broken down later in the article, but part of that is, uh, broken as well.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:38.263]  Demetrius Pag-or-tees.
[01:34:38.263 --> 01:34:40.764]  And he liked to wear t-shirts like, Born to Kill.
[01:34:43.322 --> 01:34:48.847]  And it looks like he was into Satanism, as I predicted.
[01:34:48.847 --> 01:34:52.029]  Can you guys just give me a document cam shot on my article and we'll go back to the witnesses?
[01:34:52.029 --> 01:34:54.551]  Because it has it right here.
[01:34:54.551 --> 01:34:59.656]  He has an octopus, which is a sign of international evil and conspiracy.
[01:34:59.656 --> 01:35:04.420]  A pentagram.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:07.282]  A pocket watch.
[01:35:07.282 --> 01:35:10.625]  And an iron cross.
[01:35:10.625 --> 01:35:11.206]  There is a...
[01:35:12.884 --> 01:35:15.325]  Communist star.
[01:35:15.325 --> 01:35:25.867]  So it looked like he was into evil, and that's what I noticed, even though the shooters at Columbine were Jewish.
[01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:28.587]  At least one of them was Jewish, the other purported to be part Jewish.
[01:35:28.587 --> 01:35:32.168]  They were into Nazism, because devil worshippers are just into whatever's evil.
[01:35:32.168 --> 01:35:40.730]  And I predicted in the last hour that they'd probably be a devil worshipper on Prozac-type drugs, because almost every time they are.
[01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:41.830]  This is incredible.
[01:35:43.106 --> 01:35:51.091]  Now, the father who we were just talking to said that he talked to his son and that basically the name did check out.
[01:35:51.091 --> 01:35:52.672]  So, this is preliminary.
[01:35:52.672 --> 01:35:55.974]  We're breaking this down live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:55.974 --> 01:36:00.096]  What happens in mainstream media is I'll cover what another paper covers.
[01:36:00.096 --> 01:36:01.537]  People won't sue that paper.
[01:36:01.537 --> 01:36:04.138]  They'll sue me if it's not 100% accurate.
[01:36:04.138 --> 01:36:09.942]  So we're reporting on what the Metro is reporting on and going right to Dale
[01:36:11.041 --> 01:36:14.583]  Yes, it was about five minutes to eight when my son called me out of breath.
[01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.885]  He told me that there was an active shooter at the school and that
[01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:44.699]  They let them out and the fire alarm went off and they let the kids out of class.
[01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:50.524]  And as they were walking, they heard some loud noises, but then they heard two distinct noises.
[01:36:50.524 --> 01:36:50.965]  Bang!
[01:36:50.965 --> 01:36:51.245]  Bang!
[01:36:52.077 --> 01:36:55.898]  And they took off running, and they did exactly what I told them to do.
[01:36:55.898 --> 01:36:59.279]  If anything ever happens at your school, you run away from the school.
[01:36:59.279 --> 01:37:00.559]  Don't stay at the school.
[01:37:00.559 --> 01:37:01.159]  Huddle up.
[01:37:01.159 --> 01:37:02.179]  Don't do none of that.
[01:37:02.179 --> 01:37:03.460]  You get away.
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.180]  You're a good daddy.
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:06.040]  That's what I've told my children is.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.141]  You run, you run, you zig, you zag.
[01:37:08.141 --> 01:37:12.421]  Somebody tries to kidnap you, grabs you by the arm, you start screaming, you run.
[01:37:12.421 --> 01:37:15.942]  You don't put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.
[01:37:15.942 --> 01:37:16.842]  Absolutely.
[01:37:16.842 --> 01:37:19.063]  And so his freshman son,
[01:37:20.345 --> 01:37:33.076]  Gerald's my sophomore, he's the one that I'm talking about there, and his freshman sophomore brother, James, met up with him at the store later, so they both followed Dad's instructions.
[01:37:33.076 --> 01:37:36.599]  Well good, I can tell you're happy, Daddy.
[01:37:36.599 --> 01:37:39.682]  You were telling us off-air that your son knows the suspect.
[01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:46.048]  Is this description by the Metro of somebody wearing black trench coats, weird paraphernalia, is that accurate?
[01:37:46.863 --> 01:37:48.165]  Yeah, that is accurate.
[01:37:48.165 --> 01:37:58.941]  It sounds like an, uh, I can't pronounce that last name either, Pogatus or something of that nature, but my son played, uh, if it's the same, Dimitri played football with them.
[01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:05.034]  And he was always interested in talking about guns and knives and that sort of thing.
[01:38:05.034 --> 01:38:09.857]  And he was shocked to hear that news.
[01:38:09.857 --> 01:38:12.619]  And so was I, quite frankly.
[01:38:12.619 --> 01:38:20.624]  I've also got a wife, Lydia, who got a text from somebody whose husband's on the job.
[01:38:20.624 --> 01:38:24.146]  And they're saying that 11 people are dead, at least one of them is a teacher.
[01:38:25.249 --> 01:38:34.735]  And so, during this whole incident, that's what she sent it over to me, and I've seen it too.
[01:38:34.735 --> 01:38:35.896]  Well, this is just terrible.
[01:38:35.896 --> 01:38:37.136]  I'm sad to hear that.
[01:38:37.136 --> 01:38:41.759]  You know, I predicted, because in almost every case it's the same, the devil worship's involved.
[01:38:44.178 --> 01:38:50.902]  There he is, sickeningly wearing a peace symbol on his hat, which is actually the Germanic rune of death, if you actually know what it means.
[01:38:50.902 --> 01:38:51.442]  Terrible.
[01:38:51.442 --> 01:38:53.584]  When the arms are up, it means of tree living.
[01:38:53.584 --> 01:38:55.925]  The arms are down, it's a dead tree.
[01:38:55.925 --> 01:39:05.731]  He also had pentagrams, Satanism, according to his YouTube channels, according to Facebook channels, and they're saying this is confirmed to be his channel.
[01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:13.396]  So, just really, really, really sick that yet again, it's evil, satanic people that are causing the problems and now,
[01:39:14.685 --> 01:39:19.308]  Other satanic people like George Soros are going to try to use this to take our guns.
[01:39:19.308 --> 01:39:20.208]  That's terrible.
[01:39:20.208 --> 01:39:33.895]  You know, I'll tell you, this is, uh, this, you know, they can say it was unexpected, but I can tell you within the past two months, they had a false alarm active shooter drill at the school.
[01:39:33.895 --> 01:39:39.458]  And then they had two more drills since that time within the past two months.
[01:39:39.458 --> 01:39:40.559]  And now it finally happens.
[01:39:41.568 --> 01:39:49.232]  And just last week, UTMB Hospital, thank goodness, had a mass casualty drill.
[01:39:49.232 --> 01:40:00.558]  So, I don't know if any of that's connected, but it doesn't sound, you know, like it, it doesn't sound too good to me, being a listener.
[01:40:00.558 --> 01:40:01.058]  Absolutely.
[01:40:01.058 --> 01:40:03.319]  Well, let me tell you the inside scoop on this.
[01:40:03.319 --> 01:40:06.020]  2020 even didn't report on it.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:06.120]  In 2002,
[01:40:08.772 --> 01:40:14.914]  In the mid-1990s, they started death education, suicide education, where they'd have the kids simulate getting in coffins.
[01:40:14.914 --> 01:40:19.255]  They'd teach them about death, how to commit suicide, so they wouldn't do it.
[01:40:19.255 --> 01:40:31.838]  But they found a tripling in suicides, particularly by young girls that'd get their shoelaces and go in the bathroom with the coat rack hanger on the back of the stall, and they'd hang themselves.
[01:40:32.895 --> 01:40:44.960]  That's why most schools stopped suicide prevention, because if you teach little girls don't cut yourselves, if you teach little girls don't hang yourselves, well 13 year old girls weren't thinking about that to begin with.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.301]  But now you introduce it in their minds.
[01:40:48.049 --> 01:40:55.073]  You have the media hyping mass shootings, you have them doing the shooting drills just like Parkland had shooting drills the month before as well.
[01:40:55.073 --> 01:40:58.335]  It puts the idea into mentally ill people to do it.
[01:40:58.335 --> 01:41:05.760]  Now I'm not saying you shouldn't still do it now, the ball's rolling, but this is how you introduce it with the media and the culture.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.401]  Oh my gosh, just put it out there.
[01:41:08.927 --> 01:41:11.711]  Yep, and it causes the crazies to crack.
[01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:12.872]  I hear ya.
[01:41:12.872 --> 01:41:15.356]  And so, yeah, it's just a shame.
[01:41:15.356 --> 01:41:20.763]  I mean, it's a shame what they're doing to us.
[01:41:20.763 --> 01:41:24.528]  So, that's really all I had to report.
[01:41:26.309 --> 01:41:34.532]  I'm just praying for everybody and ask everybody, all your listeners to pray for us and these families that lost their kids.
[01:41:34.532 --> 01:41:36.592]  I mean, I just can't imagine.
[01:41:36.592 --> 01:41:37.553]  It's horrific.
[01:41:37.553 --> 01:41:39.073]  I totally agree with you.
[01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:39.954]  Take the Daily Beast.
[01:41:39.954 --> 01:41:43.915]  They even got it right and said, Nick Cruz, watch the drills and learn what to do.
[01:41:45.456 --> 01:41:47.377]  Oh my goodness.
[01:41:47.377 --> 01:41:49.878]  Yeah, teach them what to do.
[01:41:49.878 --> 01:41:58.341]  Well, they know if you go back to suicides in New York off the Brooklyn Bridge or off the Empire State Building, they learn that when one person would jump, there'd be a big cluster after.
[01:41:58.341 --> 01:42:04.564]  And so, you advertise to a bunch of kids on drugs, devil worshipping, playing shoot-em-up video games all day.
[01:42:04.564 --> 01:42:12.667]  Yeah, the average shoot-em-up game doesn't make you or I a killer or our kids killers, but you take a mentally ill devil worshipper, they simulate killing all day,
[01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:14.808]  It's always the same.
[01:42:14.808 --> 01:42:25.857]  Video game, devil worshipper, into Nazis, into devil worship, into communism, who's been refused by girls, and then they go and try to kill a bunch of people to show people how powerful they are.
[01:42:25.857 --> 01:42:28.379]  It's pure, selfish Satanism.
[01:42:28.379 --> 01:42:32.662]  What do you think of the reported dirtbag still being alive?
[01:42:32.662 --> 01:42:36.004]  Well, um, yeah, I was looking at that.
[01:42:36.004 --> 01:42:40.468]  While they caught him alive, eleven other people are dead.
[01:42:40.468 --> 01:42:41.689]  Uh, that's, you know,
[01:42:42.472 --> 01:42:45.916]  I don't know, that's kind of unusual, usually when the cops respond.
[01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:48.579]  And Santa Fe's a pretty close-knit community.
[01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.321]  We have a lot of gun support.

[01:45:00.248 --> 01:45:00.548]  Go ahead.
[01:45:01.608 --> 01:45:03.129]  I just have to say something, man.
[01:45:03.129 --> 01:45:06.932]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:45:06.932 --> 01:45:08.373]  It just gets old, man.
[01:45:08.373 --> 01:45:10.795]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:45:10.795 --> 01:45:13.117]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:45:13.117 --> 01:45:17.120]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.562]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:45:20.422 --> 01:45:23.104]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:45:23.104 --> 01:45:24.465]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:45:24.465 --> 01:45:25.566]  Us being shut down?
[01:45:25.566 --> 01:45:27.067]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:45:27.067 --> 01:45:28.128]  You know what, Alex?
[01:45:28.128 --> 01:45:29.249]  Put him on pause again.
[01:45:29.249 --> 01:45:30.329]  Hey, Frank!
[01:45:30.329 --> 01:45:35.994]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:45:35.994 --> 01:45:40.517]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:45:40.517 --> 01:45:43.639]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:45:43.639 --> 01:45:44.119]  You understand?

[01:46:52.159 --> 01:46:54.720]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:32.566]  So, we've got Dale, whose son survived and got away thanks to their dad's directive of them following that common sense.
[01:47:33.326 --> 01:47:34.226]  I'm going to give you our number.
[01:47:57.603 --> 01:48:05.009]  If you can get your son to go talk to students that were eyewitnesses and get us more intel, that would be absolutely vital.
[01:48:05.009 --> 01:48:09.532]  And, you know, if you're pro-gun, if your son's a pro-gun, you probably want to get to the media as well.
[01:48:09.532 --> 01:48:25.003]  Owen Schroyer is going to be down at the high school today because the left's going to be there picking through these students and going through their Facebooks and trying to find who's anti-gun to let them speak for you and your young sons and for the victims as well.
[01:48:25.003 --> 01:48:26.224]  So can you briefly speak to that?
[01:48:26.224 --> 01:48:26.925]  Then we'll go to Rodney.
[01:48:30.773 --> 01:48:37.540]  We've got to get over there and voice our opinion on about the Second Amendment issue.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:48.511]  They're going to try to take it over like they do everything.
[01:48:48.511 --> 01:48:50.733]  We'll get over there and see if we can track down Owen.
[01:48:52.679 --> 01:48:57.321]  You know, if he wants to come over for a good dinner, that'll be fine with us.
[01:48:57.321 --> 01:49:03.804]  So we're a tight knit community, tight, tight knit community in Santa Fe.
[01:49:03.804 --> 01:49:18.870]  And as for the shooters still being alive, I think that does speak volumes for the fairness that our cops and emergency respondents personnel have for following the law.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:27.043]  Man, I'll tell you what, if I was a policeman and I rushed up on that scene, I don't know if the kid would still be alive.
[01:49:27.043 --> 01:49:30.325]  He might have got a bullet right between the eyes.
[01:49:30.325 --> 01:49:34.766]  That's just... I'm just speaking from the heart.
[01:49:34.766 --> 01:49:36.527]  Absolutely.
[01:49:36.527 --> 01:49:37.027]  Exactly.
[01:49:37.027 --> 01:49:44.851]  I don't know how you see a bunch of dead kids and don't do it, but they don't know there's somebody helping him, so it's smart if they can take him alive to do that.
[01:49:44.851 --> 01:49:47.832]  That's a lot of restraint by the police, so... Absolutely.
[01:49:48.152 --> 01:49:48.392]  All right.
[01:49:48.392 --> 01:49:49.253]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:49:49.253 --> 01:49:50.474]  We're going to put you on hold.
[01:49:50.474 --> 01:49:51.455]  Make sure we have your numbers.
[01:49:51.455 --> 01:49:52.476]  I'm going to give your number to Owen.
[01:49:52.476 --> 01:49:53.857]  I'm going to give you Owen's numbers.
[01:49:53.857 --> 01:49:54.618]  God bless you, Dale.
[01:49:54.618 --> 01:49:55.839]  Thanks for calling.
[01:49:55.839 --> 01:49:56.300]  Thank you.
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.381]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:49:57.381 --> 01:49:58.942]  God bless you.
[01:49:58.942 --> 01:50:03.466]  And Owen Schroer and some of our crew are going to be down there in the next few hours, so they're going to be on the side of that.
[01:50:03.466 --> 01:50:03.627]  Wow.
[01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:06.952]  That'd be powerful, too, to go take those guys out to dinner.
[01:50:06.952 --> 01:50:09.634]  We should take them out to dinner and interview them or something like that.
[01:50:09.634 --> 01:50:11.175]  Probably want more reporters.
[01:50:11.175 --> 01:50:15.639]  If I had more reporters, that's one of our anchors we're sending down there if we try to hire more crew.
[01:50:15.639 --> 01:50:17.280]  But I'm not complaining.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.844]  It's just that I'd love to be able to do a lot more.
[01:50:21.844 --> 01:50:25.567]  I would love to be able to do a lot more.
[01:50:25.567 --> 01:50:27.149]  Rodney, thanks for holding.
[01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:28.970]  I really appreciate you holding.
[01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:29.591]  You're on the air.
[01:50:29.591 --> 01:50:30.792]  Thank you, sir, from Santa Fe.
[01:50:32.079 --> 01:50:33.160]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.962]  I'll tell you what I know, OK?
[01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.463]  A friend of mine owns Indian Automotive.
[01:50:37.463 --> 01:50:37.984]  He doesn't own it.
[01:50:37.984 --> 01:50:39.265]  He's the head guy over there.
[01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:41.406]  His name's Bubba.
[01:50:41.406 --> 01:50:42.567]  He runs that mechanic shop.
[01:50:42.567 --> 01:50:46.590]  It's called Indian Automotive, which is directly across from the high school.
[01:50:46.590 --> 01:50:48.172]  And his wife runs it, too.
[01:50:48.172 --> 01:50:49.673]  Lori is her name.
[01:50:49.673 --> 01:50:51.414]  And I've known Lori for over 25 years.
[01:50:51.414 --> 01:50:53.936]  Her father and I grew up together.
[01:50:53.936 --> 01:50:56.138]  We went to school here in Santa Fe.
[01:50:56.138 --> 01:51:00.301]  And so what I know when I talked to her father this morning,
[01:51:00.879 --> 01:51:11.246]  Is that Indian Automotive housed or sheltered upwards to 150 people in that three-car automotive shop that he has there.
[01:51:11.246 --> 01:51:14.988]  So that might be somebody you want to talk to, you know, get your reporter over and talk to him.
[01:51:14.988 --> 01:51:21.353]  CBS News this morning was reporting, about 10-20 this morning, was reporting an officer had been shot.
[01:51:21.353 --> 01:51:27.817]  And that's what I'd like to speak to you because since I've been going to school here, I've lived here since 1977, and Dale's right real close to me.
[01:51:27.817 --> 01:51:29.578]  I probably know Dale, but
[01:51:30.774 --> 01:51:35.236]  We've always had armed security at the school since the 70s.
[01:51:35.236 --> 01:51:38.458]  We've had armed security at our high school and our junior high school.
[01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:48.082]  So I'm wondering if that report was accurate that the officer was shot that was, you know, the armed officer that was taking care of security at that school.
[01:51:48.082 --> 01:51:50.363]  I'm very curious about that.
[01:51:50.363 --> 01:51:58.267]  As of about an hour ago, Highway 6 was shut off from 1764 going from Santa Fe towards the high school and Alvin.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:01.502]  Going towards the high school on Highway 6.
[01:52:01.502 --> 01:52:03.803]  So I don't know if it's clear in about an hour.
[01:52:03.803 --> 01:52:10.627]  About an hour, maybe an hour and a half ago, I was out there, you know, coming back home because I was going to put my boat in the water tomorrow, Alex.
[01:52:10.627 --> 01:52:15.189]  I've been working on my boat for two months straight trying to get this stupid thing ready and then this happened.
[01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.950]  So that's out the window.
[01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:20.232]  I'm going to spend the rest of the day praying and fasting about this situation.
[01:52:20.232 --> 01:52:20.733]  I don't know.
[01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:24.055]  I think my next door neighbor's daughter, she goes to that high school.
[01:52:24.055 --> 01:52:26.356]  I think she's okay because he's not bouncing off the walls.
[01:52:27.096 --> 01:52:29.478]  So, I think everything's okay as far as that goes.
[01:52:29.478 --> 01:52:36.163]  So, I'm curious about, but please Alex, I'd like to say, please make sure that the reporting is accurate.
[01:52:36.163 --> 01:52:37.104]  The last thing we need is...
[01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:42.248]  You know, uh, speculation about what happened over.
[01:52:42.248 --> 01:52:46.770]  When he let this thing play out, the officers responded very well.
[01:52:46.770 --> 01:52:49.132]  Um, and so, you know, Dale is... No, no, I agree.
[01:52:49.132 --> 01:52:52.313]  Listen, it's the media that said that I said Parkland didn't happen.
[01:52:52.313 --> 01:52:53.974]  So they're going to try to misrepresent whatever we do.
[01:52:53.974 --> 01:52:55.395]  We're being extra careful.
[01:52:55.395 --> 01:53:03.260]  Even when it's being reported by other newspapers, the identity of the shooter, I said it may not be true just because they try to twist everything we do.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:03.560]  Right.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:04.200]  No, I understand.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:04.940]  I understand, Alex.
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:07.482]  It's just, you know how, you know how important it is.
[01:53:08.423 --> 01:53:12.185]  No, I totally agree.
[01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:13.226]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:53:13.226 --> 01:53:18.588]  We already have Hogg and the rest of the usual suspects blaming the Second Amendment, blaming Trump.
[01:53:18.588 --> 01:53:23.391]  So all I'm saying to the parents are, conservatives and Christians and patriots are always very reserved.
[01:53:24.071 --> 01:53:25.511]  The left's going to be out there today.
[01:53:25.511 --> 01:53:28.352]  They're going to find their people they want as spokespersons.
[01:53:28.352 --> 01:53:33.954]  It's critical that people that don't want the First Amendment or Second Amendment blamed get on the news.
[01:53:33.954 --> 01:53:52.320]  And I know people out there aren't glory pigs and aren't wanting to be on television, but I guarantee you they're looking at parents of the Democratic Party, they're looking at anti-gunner databases, and they're calling people right now to stick them on CNN, ABC, CBS, and everywhere else to demonize the Second Amendment.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.080]  So that's why I'm saying
[01:53:53.948 --> 01:53:54.969]  I agree.
[01:53:54.969 --> 01:53:56.050]  The police responded quickly.
[01:53:56.050 --> 01:53:57.191]  Probably a real shooting.
[01:53:57.191 --> 01:53:58.812]  You know, who knows?
[01:53:58.812 --> 01:54:00.353]  We're always going to sit back and look.
[01:54:00.353 --> 01:54:03.496]  And when I say real shooting, you know, real the way they're saying it is.
[01:54:03.496 --> 01:54:06.178]  Because I guess last hour, he's probably a devil worshiper.
[01:54:06.178 --> 01:54:10.281]  And according to the news, you know, that looks like what he is.
[01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:12.983]  Yeah, like I said, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not demonizing anyone.
[01:54:12.983 --> 01:54:15.865]  I don't know this, this kid from, you know, from Adam.
[01:54:15.865 --> 01:54:17.947]  So I'm not going to make any accusations here.
[01:54:17.947 --> 01:54:21.950]  I don't know what he did was evil and there's no question about it.
[01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:23.131]  But, um, you know,
[01:54:23.837 --> 01:54:27.959]  When I went to high school here, we used to have guns in our back windows of our trucks.
[01:54:27.959 --> 01:54:29.319]  After school, we'd go dove hunting.
[01:54:29.319 --> 01:54:34.901]  You know, we'd be like, okay, we're going dove hunting, bring your guns, we're going to a bean field, we're going to go out there and go dove hunt.
[01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:42.684]  Okay, we'd stick our 7-ups and bring our guns to school, leave them on our windows, you know, on our back windows of our trucks, and after school, we'd go dove hunt.
[01:54:42.684 --> 01:54:46.565]  And so, you know, obviously you can't do that anymore, but yeah, the world is changing.
[01:54:46.565 --> 01:54:50.907]  I'd like to say also that if people would understand what they're doing to Trump right now,
[01:54:51.621 --> 01:54:55.944]  They're using the exact same tactic against constitutional law in this country.
[01:54:55.944 --> 01:54:58.265]  They keep trying to tell everybody it's a democracy.
[01:54:58.265 --> 01:54:58.946]  It's not.
[01:54:58.946 --> 01:55:00.086]  But they're using the same thing.
[01:55:00.086 --> 01:55:03.308]  They're a constitutional republic and they're dismantling the country.
[01:55:03.308 --> 01:55:08.291]  Just like he said MS-13 are animals, they said that he said Hispanics are animals.
[01:55:08.291 --> 01:55:11.433]  Everything they do is twisting and deception.
[01:55:11.433 --> 01:55:16.937]  Rodney, if you want to leave us your number as a point of contact for Owen, or if you want to talk to us, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:55:16.937 --> 01:55:18.758]  God bless you and I appreciate your fine points.
[01:55:19.318 --> 01:55:23.280]  They've got John and others that are eyewitnesses, we'll go to them as well.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.941]  Anything else you wanted to add, Rodney?
[01:55:25.941 --> 01:55:35.005]  No, I just think we need to pray for America, pray for our youth, and you know, stay close to Jesus, because he's the only real protection that we have anymore.
[01:55:35.005 --> 01:55:39.607]  No, I totally agree, and well you heard Ted Nugent, this is an evil problem.
[01:55:39.607 --> 01:55:40.468]  Absolutely, I agree 100%.
[01:55:42.122 --> 01:55:42.882]  God bless you.
[01:55:42.882 --> 01:55:51.607]  The only reason I said he was probably a devil worshipper is they almost always wear black trench coats and have pentagrams and love Satan and play shoot-em-up video games.
[01:55:51.607 --> 01:55:53.889]  And then people go, oh, don't blame video games.
[01:55:53.889 --> 01:55:54.629]  They're into video games.
[01:55:54.629 --> 01:56:06.656]  I'm not saying a normal person playing one of those is going to do it, but if you're already mentally ill and you're on one of these Prozac drugs, I mean, look, he was wearing communist pins, German pins, World War I iron crosses, pentagrams.
[01:56:07.952 --> 01:56:11.115]  It's just whatever he could wear to be shocking and look powerful and evil.
[01:56:11.115 --> 01:56:16.439]  And I guess he thought going and killing a bunch of innocent people would just prove how evil he was to his master.
[01:56:16.439 --> 01:56:18.881]  I've got an hour and 58 minutes and I have it plugged.
[01:56:18.881 --> 01:56:21.423]  We're not going to be able to fund the operation if I don't.
[01:56:22.281 --> 01:56:23.201]  We're trying to expand.
[01:56:23.201 --> 01:56:27.663]  We're trying to put reporters in the field all over the world, from Europe to the UK to the US.
[01:56:27.663 --> 01:56:29.224]  We're fighting hard, as you know.
[01:56:29.224 --> 01:56:31.104]  We make it easy to support us.

[01:57:09.618 --> 01:57:10.038]  But listen.

[01:57:27.927 --> 01:57:28.427]  If you don't,
[01:57:29.298 --> 01:57:32.382]  We'll fold because it takes money to run this operation.

[01:57:44.378 --> 01:57:44.899]  We'll be back.

[01:59:26.271 --> 01:59:27.431]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:30.161 --> 02:00:33.825]  You know, I don't take this broadcast for granted.
[02:00:33.825 --> 02:00:37.268]  In fact, I realize it's incredible power, it's incredible strength.
[02:00:38.513 --> 02:00:58.087]  And the fact that we have listeners in every town, in every city, in this country, no matter how small the town is, or how big, used to, I'd always do what no other talk radio or TV does, I'd say, email me a scan of your driver's license, or your photo ID, or where you're at, or take a photo of you with a newspaper today, in your town.
[02:00:58.087 --> 02:01:03.632]  And these listeners would sometimes have to go to a local store at a fax machine and would send it to us.
[02:01:04.525 --> 02:01:07.466]  Now we just have caller ID on the phone system, which is digital.
[02:01:07.466 --> 02:01:09.487]  We can see everybody's calling from there.
[02:01:09.487 --> 02:01:10.427]  CNN doesn't do that.
[02:01:10.427 --> 02:01:12.808]  They're famous for having fake callers, you name it.
[02:01:12.808 --> 02:01:17.569]  You heard that last caller sound like a police officer or something, or firefighter.
[02:01:17.569 --> 02:01:20.430]  He's like, please, Alex, just be careful and just get it right.
[02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:22.511]  I understand that's how this is.
[02:01:22.511 --> 02:01:24.672]  And I understand that what we say has power.
[02:01:24.672 --> 02:01:25.932]  I get that.
[02:01:25.932 --> 02:01:27.713]  And I'm not saying every mass shooting stage.
[02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:28.773]  I don't think most of them are.
[02:01:29.704 --> 02:01:31.705]  They stand down in these Democrat areas.
[02:01:31.705 --> 02:01:32.905]  They let the attacks happen.
[02:01:32.905 --> 02:01:35.986]  The people are always on psychotropic drugs.
[02:01:35.986 --> 02:01:36.667]  It's the same story.
[02:01:36.667 --> 02:01:38.227]  They're always wearing black trench coats.
[02:01:38.227 --> 02:01:40.268]  They're always into devil worship.
[02:01:40.268 --> 02:01:45.030]  It's the MO of we know the type of evil.
[02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:48.992]  The big octopus is the devil here, folks.
[02:01:48.992 --> 02:01:51.552]  So I get it.
[02:01:51.552 --> 02:01:55.574]  When I say staged, I mean that the culture has staged this.
[02:01:55.574 --> 02:01:57.735]  He's got this hydra and this pentagram and
[02:01:59.673 --> 02:02:03.415]  Communists and Nazi paraphernalia, and that's what I know about devil worshippers.
[02:02:03.415 --> 02:02:11.620]  They're in to whatever they think is dark and bad.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.602]  I'll give black people this.
[02:02:13.602 --> 02:02:16.924]  They every once in a while are into voodoo, but they don't think that's the devil.
[02:02:16.924 --> 02:02:22.407]  But I don't know any black people that are in to actually wearing pentagrams and stuff.
[02:02:22.407 --> 02:02:23.808]  I don't think I've ever seen one do it.
[02:02:25.452 --> 02:02:28.474]  But I tell you, whites and Hispanics and people do it.
[02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:30.555]  And it's mainly white people.
[02:02:30.555 --> 02:02:33.777]  And it's sick.
[02:02:33.777 --> 02:02:35.718]  And people think it's powerful.
[02:02:35.718 --> 02:02:42.221]  And I'll be honest, when I see somebody wearing a big pentagram around their neck or something, I want to punch them in the nose.
[02:02:42.221 --> 02:02:46.204]  Because statistically, I know that's the group you got to watch right there.
[02:02:46.204 --> 02:02:49.145]  And MS-13's into a bunch of devil worship too.
[02:02:49.145 --> 02:02:50.006]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:02:51.015 --> 02:02:52.515]  And they're worse than animals.
[02:02:52.515 --> 02:02:54.636]  Animals are nice compared to this crud.
[02:02:54.636 --> 02:02:56.136]  I'm sick of devil worshippers.
[02:02:56.136 --> 02:02:56.796]  What about you?
[02:02:56.796 --> 02:02:59.317]  John is an eyewitness in Santa Fe.
[02:02:59.317 --> 02:03:00.657]  John, thanks for calling.
[02:03:00.657 --> 02:03:01.498]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:01.498 --> 02:03:02.018]  You're on the air.
[02:03:02.018 --> 02:03:03.518]  Go ahead.
[02:03:03.518 --> 02:03:06.039]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:03:06.039 --> 02:03:08.319]  Oh man, I was really glad school was about over.
[02:03:08.319 --> 02:03:09.780]  I was hoping there wouldn't be another mass shooting.
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:11.380]  How about you?
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:15.381]  Well, I really expected something to happen there.
[02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:18.402]  You know, I don't think anybody has
[02:03:19.312 --> 02:03:28.274]  I told you, but there was another incident about a month or two ago at the same school with a suspected shooter.
[02:03:28.274 --> 02:03:37.317]  I'm trying to get a hold of my grandson right now, who is still in lockdown at school, by the way, to get the information on that.
[02:03:37.317 --> 02:03:40.498]  But they still haven't let him out.
[02:03:40.498 --> 02:03:41.438]  He's in the junior high.
[02:03:41.438 --> 02:03:44.439]  They're still locked in over there.
[02:03:44.439 --> 02:03:45.379]  Another incident, huh?
[02:03:46.499 --> 02:03:50.582]  Yeah, there was news about two months ago that the same high school was in shutdown.
[02:03:50.582 --> 02:03:52.663]  They had the roads blocked off and everything.
[02:03:52.663 --> 02:03:56.385]  Like I said, it's been a month or two ago.
[02:03:56.385 --> 02:03:58.266]  I can't remember what it was about.
[02:03:58.266 --> 02:04:06.431]  I was about to say, they use these drills sometimes, the school administrators do, I'm not even blaming the police, the bureaucrats do, to cover up things that happen.
[02:04:06.431 --> 02:04:08.273]  But they said they've had two drills.
[02:04:08.273 --> 02:04:10.554]  That's even been on the news in the last two months.
[02:04:10.554 --> 02:04:11.855]  Perhaps that could be what you're talking about?
[02:04:13.706 --> 02:04:14.487]  I don't know.
[02:04:14.487 --> 02:04:15.967]  I don't know.
[02:04:15.967 --> 02:04:26.453]  I just heard the other gentleman, I believe it was Dale, whoever it was, the first guy talking about the UTMB had a mass casualty girl.
[02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.222]  Well John, we're back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:31.222 --> 02:04:37.146]  Let me pick your brain for a few more as you called in about the mood of the town, what you think of law enforcement, what you think of their response.
[02:04:37.146 --> 02:04:44.211]  Looks like it was pretty quick compared to the other events where they stand down for 15-20 minutes or longer.
[02:04:44.211 --> 02:04:46.353]  We'll talk about it all on the other side.
[02:04:46.353 --> 02:04:48.214]  And this is totally overshadowed.
[02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:53.998]  The guy that went into the Trump Golf Course Hotel and shot a bunch of stuff up, including one cop got hurt.
[02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:58.851]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:13.174]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:13.174 --> 02:06:15.995]  Demetrius Boguchis!
[02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:41.365]  That is a Greek name.
[02:06:41.365 --> 02:06:41.905]  17.
[02:06:41.905 --> 02:06:50.549]  We've had one parent call in before we even knew that his name was out and said no, his son knew him from football and if that's his name then he did wear black trench coats and all the rest of it.
[02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:54.771]  He's got pentagrams on his YouTube channel, pentagrams on his Facebook channel.
[02:06:54.771 --> 02:06:57.593]  Born to kill stuff.
[02:06:57.593 --> 02:07:03.796]  He's got hydras, he's got pentagrams, he's got hammer and sickles, he's got German iron crosses.
[02:07:03.796 --> 02:07:05.616]  That could be World War I or World War II.
[02:07:05.616 --> 02:07:06.637]  Could be Nazi, couldn't be.
[02:07:08.459 --> 02:07:14.264]  But that's what I've noticed about devil worshippers, is that it's just a pantheon of evil.
[02:07:14.264 --> 02:07:17.967]  Now he's the alleged shooter who's still alive and now it's being reported.
[02:07:17.967 --> 02:07:20.249]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:07:20.249 --> 02:07:28.375]  First place we saw it about 30 minutes ago, right after Caller talked about it, was the big Metro paper out of London, England.
[02:07:28.375 --> 02:07:37.143]  But we're all watching Infowars.com and DrugsReport.com also has excellent coverage of what's going on.
[02:07:38.305 --> 02:07:39.486]  So that's just some of the news.
[02:07:39.486 --> 02:07:44.989]  There's also been a Cuban plane crash developing.
[02:07:44.989 --> 02:07:46.490]  We're going to be looking at all of that.
[02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:49.492]  It's now 10 dead in Texas, a school shooting.
[02:07:49.492 --> 02:07:50.853]  In most of the reports, some are saying 8.
[02:07:50.853 --> 02:07:55.636]  In other reports, let's hope that it's only 8.
[02:07:55.636 --> 02:07:57.997]  I haven't even covered this yet, and I will after we take calls.
[02:07:57.997 --> 02:07:59.038]  I meant to open the show up with it.
[02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:03.141]  Man opens fire at Trump Miami Resort, spewing hate about President.
[02:08:03.141 --> 02:08:04.562]  Who is Jonathan Odey?
[02:08:05.734 --> 02:08:07.575]  We will talk about all of that.
[02:08:07.575 --> 02:08:11.377]  I had that printed in my stack this morning, but never went to it.
[02:08:11.377 --> 02:08:18.442]  I've got all these notes I've written, so please get me who is Jonathan Odie, the reported shooter.
[02:08:18.442 --> 02:08:23.665]  Now again, how this works, folks, is mainstream media will link to somebody and say they're the shooter.
[02:08:23.665 --> 02:08:26.586]  I'll cover it, it'll be changed later, and then I get sued.
[02:08:26.586 --> 02:08:30.749]  Because the Democrats are targeting me, so we have to put lots of revisos in here.
[02:08:32.702 --> 02:08:33.743]  As it unfolds.
[02:08:33.743 --> 02:08:38.185]  Trump's coming out saying that the DOJ is out to frame me.
[02:08:38.185 --> 02:08:40.827]  His approval rating continues to go up and up and up.
[02:08:40.827 --> 02:08:46.730]  A lot of experts are saying Obama's legacy is already destroyed.
[02:08:46.730 --> 02:08:51.673]  We're going to be talking about all of that after we take some more of your phone calls.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:09:05.864]  But if you go back to InfoWars.com, we've got all the live feeds up there, and you may say, well Alex, we're already watching on local TV, or already listening on local radio, or we're already listening, watching the feed on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:05.864 --> 02:09:07.464]  I know, but that's how we reach more people.
[02:09:07.464 --> 02:09:09.325]  It's how we get around the censors.
[02:09:09.325 --> 02:09:17.167]  If you'll just spread the links, if you'll just spread the articles, if you'll just do that, it will bypass Soros and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:09:17.167 --> 02:09:18.768]  They're trying to physically block us.
[02:09:26.144 --> 02:09:27.845]  And of course there's another big story here.
[02:09:27.845 --> 02:09:31.268]  We've totally caught Bolton.
[02:09:31.268 --> 02:09:39.393]  It's now admitted trying to say we're going to give North Korea the Libya treatment, which is exactly what they don't want, so that they break the deal with Trump.
[02:09:39.393 --> 02:09:47.959]  Talk about deep state sabotage, and I'm sure Trump knows what he's doing, but he keeps bringing these neocons in that cannot be trusted.
[02:09:47.959 --> 02:09:51.502]  And I think this is a big reason to throw Bolton out on his face.
[02:09:52.554 --> 02:09:59.599]  Because he may think Trump wasn't watching CBS News, he only watches Fox News, when he went on Face the Nation and said all that.
[02:09:59.599 --> 02:10:04.942]  But that is just an incredible attempt to sabotage this important historic peace deal.
[02:10:04.942 --> 02:10:07.684]  Alright, John's an eyewitness in Santa Fe, finishing up.
[02:10:07.684 --> 02:10:16.150]  Then we'll go to John, who used to live in Santa Fe, and says the city sympathizes with the KKK.
[02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:20.873]  Okay, well, I know East Texas has some of that going on, but I've been through Santa Fe, it's like 70%
[02:10:25.235 --> 02:10:44.199]  Alex, I just want to confirm to you that I have had, from good, good sources, I do work for the ex-mayor of Santa Fe.
[02:10:44.199 --> 02:10:48.600]  He confirmed to me there are 10 dead from his sources.
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:51.141]  So that is 10 dead.
[02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:51.921]  I mean, not official.
[02:10:52.842 --> 02:10:54.023]  That's what I was told.
[02:10:54.023 --> 02:10:56.664]  He gets, you know, he knows everybody.
[02:10:56.664 --> 02:11:00.506]  He rubs elbows with the current administration, so.
[02:11:00.506 --> 02:11:07.990]  But anyways, just before we get into what I saw, I deal with this witchcraft and Satanism on a daily basis.
[02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:10.432]  I'm a lay preacher.
[02:11:10.432 --> 02:11:15.254]  Probably if you was to talk to your reporters, I send them articles I write all the time.
[02:11:15.254 --> 02:11:16.495]  They could probably confirm that.
[02:11:16.495 --> 02:11:17.576]  I've been doing it for 25 years.
[02:11:20.516 --> 02:11:24.519]  Yeah, these people are, they're just nuts and crazy.
[02:11:24.519 --> 02:11:36.327]  And 15 minutes after that happened, my daughter sent me that man's, that boy's, that 17-year-old boy's Facebook profile.
[02:11:36.327 --> 02:11:37.528]  I've got the pictures and stuff.
[02:11:37.528 --> 02:11:46.954]  Of course, they've already jerked it down, but I've got the screenshot say, to which I will write an article this evening when I get home from work.
[02:11:46.954 --> 02:11:49.296]  But yeah, he pentagrams
[02:11:50.009 --> 02:11:52.431]  Man, the man's a devil worshipper, is what he is.
[02:11:52.431 --> 02:12:00.977]  And my grandson is trying to gather some more information about him, which I will write and put in an article.
[02:12:00.977 --> 02:12:05.880]  But on to what I saw.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.443]  Probably about 10 minutes after that happened, Alex, you would not believe.
[02:12:10.443 --> 02:12:19.049]  I mean, I have never in my life seen so many police cars and first responders
[02:12:19.764 --> 02:12:28.391]  Going, I was coming up Highway 6 in Santa Fe, not too far from the high school, when all the cops responded.
[02:12:28.391 --> 02:12:34.396]  I mean, it was like cockroaches coming out of the woodwork after they was being sprayed.
[02:12:34.396 --> 02:12:46.866]  I mean, it was, and then for an hour afterward, I mean, there was, there was police coming from cities 5, 10 miles away.
[02:12:46.866 --> 02:12:48.988]  I was about to say, this is a point I meant to make.
[02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:54.712]  You've got this incredibly expensive school that looks like it probably cost $300 million.
[02:12:54.712 --> 02:12:56.233]  Nice, beautiful facility.
[02:12:56.233 --> 02:12:56.833]  Huge.
[02:12:56.833 --> 02:12:58.054]  They just built it, yes.
[02:12:58.054 --> 02:13:00.055]  They just built it three or four years ago, yes.
[02:13:00.795 --> 02:13:12.909]  And it's a huge, nice facility, and they couldn't afford but two security guards for thousands and thousands and thousands of students, but ten minutes after, you've got, it looks like, 300 police cars.
[02:13:12.909 --> 02:13:15.952]  I mean, like, because we're showing helicopter shots, and that's great.
[02:13:15.952 --> 02:13:20.297]  I'm glad they've got those resources, but why not have them stationed in place
[02:13:21.158 --> 02:13:32.564]  Just 5 or 6 officers instead of 200 show up 10 minutes late and I'm not blaming them but it just doesn't make sense if you know the schools are the target of these devil worshippers.
[02:13:32.564 --> 02:13:36.426]  There's 1500, I think there's 1500 students in that school system.
[02:13:36.426 --> 02:13:38.027]  Just that one right there.
[02:13:38.027 --> 02:13:47.231]  Santa Fe has a couple other and they're just building another middle school.
[02:13:47.231 --> 02:13:48.492]  This has got to stop.
[02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:57.594]  People got to quit blaming the damn guns and start putting the blame where exactly the blame needs to go.
[02:13:57.594 --> 02:13:58.895]  It's on people.
[02:13:58.895 --> 02:14:02.778]  People knew about this kid on Facebook.
[02:14:02.778 --> 02:14:09.182]  It took my daughter a whole of five minutes to find out once she found out the name from my niece.
[02:14:11.994 --> 02:14:12.834]  Who knew somebody?
[02:14:12.834 --> 02:14:15.095]  She got off, it took her all five minutes.
[02:14:15.095 --> 02:14:23.139]  Oh and sure enough, he was obsessed with video games, shoot-em-up games, a devil worshiper, it's always the same.
[02:14:23.139 --> 02:14:27.741]  She's put, Dad, this is one sick, one sick dude.
[02:14:27.741 --> 02:14:32.843]  And then I told her, I said, baby girl, I said, screenshot all that stuff because we're going to take it down.
[02:14:32.843 --> 02:14:36.344]  Within 15 minutes of me telling her that, they took it down.
[02:14:36.344 --> 02:14:38.025]  They don't want people to know
[02:14:39.119 --> 02:14:42.082]  What in the hell is really going on out there?
[02:14:42.082 --> 02:14:44.384]  And who the real problem is?
[02:14:44.384 --> 02:14:46.686]  That's the problem!
[02:14:46.686 --> 02:14:50.649]  Well, you know, I know that we found his Facebook, but they've already deleted it.
[02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:55.353]  In case you got something we didn't get, please send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:56.694]  And John, we've got your number.
[02:14:56.694 --> 02:15:03.821]  If it's okay, I'm going to give it to Owen Schroer and crew, so that you guys can all meet at a park or something, and he can one by one
[02:15:04.381 --> 02:15:07.545]  Get the eyewitnesses that want to be interviewed, interviewed.
[02:15:07.545 --> 02:15:12.731]  So if you want to be interviewed by Owen Schroer, folks, give us a call at 877-789-ALEX.

[02:15:20.321 --> 02:15:23.344]  It's particularly important to get the survivors.
[02:15:24.966 --> 02:15:36.615]  Or any parents that have their kids in the hospital, if you want us to come interview you or them, because CNN and all the rest of them are only going to show a handful of anti-gunners and try to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:15:36.615 --> 02:15:38.096]  Powerful information, John.
[02:15:38.096 --> 02:15:41.318]  Thank you.
[02:15:41.318 --> 02:15:42.159]  Get his information.
[02:15:42.159 --> 02:15:43.600]  I want to talk to him.
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.181]  Talk to his daughter.
[02:15:45.181 --> 02:15:47.563]  That's the young lady that knew him and got the information out.
[02:15:47.563 --> 02:15:48.784]  This is powerful.
[02:15:48.784 --> 02:15:51.366]  We are first responders in the information war.
[02:15:51.366 --> 02:15:53.568]  We'll be right back with John, who used to live in the town, he says.
[02:15:55.595 --> 02:15:57.577]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:57.577 --> 02:16:02.882]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.

[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.324]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:17:42.324 --> 02:17:45.766]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:17:45.766 --> 02:17:48.889]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[02:19:59.716 --> 02:20:07.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.862 --> 02:20:16.487]  From the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:38.607 --> 02:20:44.148]  You know the statement, when ISIS runs over a bunch of people, killing hundreds with a truck, we're gonna ban trucks.
[02:20:44.148 --> 02:20:46.409]  But that's intentional.
[02:20:46.409 --> 02:20:48.349]  Not by the truck, by the ISIS member.
[02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:59.552]  But we got 107 people, perhaps dead, we don't know, after a Boeing 737 airliner carrying 107 people crashes moments after takeoff.
[02:20:59.552 --> 02:21:04.814]  A real tragedy there.
[02:21:04.814 --> 02:21:06.394]  The plane reportedly belongs to
[02:21:07.554 --> 02:21:12.938]  The government of Cuba, the domestic flight was due to last around 20 minutes.
[02:21:12.938 --> 02:21:24.307]  It crashed between the locality there inside Cuba, outside Havana.
[02:21:24.307 --> 02:21:25.488]  That's part of life, folks.
[02:21:25.488 --> 02:21:29.391]  There's seven and a half billion of us.
[02:21:29.391 --> 02:21:31.313]  And millions are coming in every day.
[02:21:31.313 --> 02:21:33.054]  Millions are going out every day.
[02:21:33.054 --> 02:21:33.935]  I forget the number.
[02:21:33.935 --> 02:21:36.057]  How many people are born every day and how many die every day?
[02:21:37.765 --> 02:21:43.048]  Last time I checked it was like 400 and something thousand and that was years ago, some factoid.
[02:21:43.048 --> 02:21:44.609]  So who knows if that's right.
[02:21:44.609 --> 02:21:51.753]  Can we look up the number of people estimated to be born every day versus die every day?
[02:21:51.753 --> 02:21:53.854]  Coming in, coming out constantly.
[02:21:53.854 --> 02:21:55.875]  Checking in, checking out constantly.
[02:21:55.875 --> 02:21:59.778]  Our hearts go out to those who died, but you don't ban aviation
[02:22:00.848 --> 02:22:01.708]  Because it happened.
[02:22:01.708 --> 02:22:05.949]  It's still very, very rare to die in a plane crash if you live in a western country.
[02:22:05.949 --> 02:22:12.651]  Now, if you live in Cuba, they have a worse record than other countries because they're communists.
[02:22:12.651 --> 02:22:17.993]  Who is Jonathan Odie, the man shot by cops after firing a gun at Trump National?
[02:22:19.312 --> 02:22:25.456]  By the way, that had some of the top world championships held there until Trump got elected and they took it away from him.
[02:22:25.456 --> 02:22:27.057]  All the things Trump's been punished for.
[02:22:27.057 --> 02:22:31.479]  He's lost reportedly billions of dollars for what he's done standing up for us.
[02:22:31.479 --> 02:22:32.940]  We should never forget that.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:38.604]  Less than a year ago, South African native Jonathan Odey proudly posed behind the backdrop of an American flag.
[02:22:38.604 --> 02:22:41.926]  Titled his new citizenship, God Bless the USA and America, he wrote.
[02:22:42.486 --> 02:22:44.467]  But now he's an anti-Trump person.
[02:22:44.467 --> 02:22:47.168]  We'll cover that after we talk to the next caller.
[02:22:47.168 --> 02:22:51.569]  John says he used to live in Santa Fe, and he's got some comments.
[02:22:51.569 --> 02:22:52.189]  Go ahead, John.
[02:22:52.189 --> 02:22:54.390]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:54.390 --> 02:23:01.173]  First of all, I lived there from early 2003 until July of 2006.
[02:23:01.173 --> 02:23:04.154]  And for the record, most of the people... Wait a minute, I know John.
[02:23:04.154 --> 02:23:05.574]  John's one of our longtime callers.
[02:23:05.574 --> 02:23:07.175]  We even know who John is.
[02:23:07.175 --> 02:23:07.515]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:12.392]  And most of the people there in Santa Fe were wonderful people.
[02:23:12.392 --> 02:23:14.773]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[02:23:14.773 --> 02:23:20.255]  However, there was a small cadre of KKK types, and here's what they did.
[02:23:21.690 --> 02:23:30.494]  First of all, in around July, June or July of 2006, they went to a young black woman's house.
[02:23:30.494 --> 02:23:37.537]  Now, this young lady had not done anything or said anything to disparage anyone or to hurt anyone.
[02:23:37.537 --> 02:23:42.840]  She was just minding her business and trying to raise her family in peace and quiet.
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:49.843]  And they spray painted her white home with black graffiti from a spray can with vile
[02:23:50.712 --> 02:23:58.414]  Uh, slogans and garbage that you couldn't say over the air, and of course the usual swastikas all over the house.
[02:23:58.414 --> 02:24:03.075]  And I went before the city council and criticized the KKK.
[02:24:03.075 --> 02:24:12.237]  And by the way, at the time, the JP was both the head of the KKK chapter and the Masonic Lodge chapter there in Santa Fe.
[02:24:12.237 --> 02:24:17.298]  I don't know if he still is or not, but I criticized them.
[02:24:17.298 --> 02:24:18.519]  I said, here we are in 2006.
[02:24:19.952 --> 02:24:23.654]  And there are some people still living in the Stone Age.
[02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:45.505]  And what happened just a couple of nights later, someone came over to the rental property that I was renting, it was on the same property as my landlord's, and they keyed my truck, they scratched it up with a key, and I called the police, and the officer came down there and took the report, and then the next night they did it again!
[02:24:45.505 --> 02:24:47.986]  And I called the officer and he came by there,
[02:24:48.809 --> 02:24:55.332]  And I asked the officer, I said, what would happen if I caught someone vandalizing my truck and shot him?
[02:24:55.332 --> 02:24:57.373]  He said, well then you'd go to prison.
[02:24:57.373 --> 02:24:58.314]  I said, fine.
[02:24:58.314 --> 02:25:04.737]  What would happen if I caught someone vandalizing my truck and hosed him down with some pepper spray?
[02:25:04.737 --> 02:25:07.379]  Then you'd be charged with assault and battery.
[02:25:07.379 --> 02:25:14.742]  Not once did that officer mention what he would do to the criminal who was vandalizing my truck.
[02:25:14.742 --> 02:25:16.003]  Not once.
[02:25:16.003 --> 02:25:17.804]  Then when I called the police chief,
[02:25:18.416 --> 02:25:24.842]  To speak to him, his very nice secretary told me, John, he's out of town for a few more days.
[02:25:24.842 --> 02:25:26.363]  He's on vacation.
[02:25:26.363 --> 02:25:29.006]  I'll have him call you when he gets back.
[02:25:29.006 --> 02:25:33.650]  Two weeks after he returned to town, he still had not called me.
[02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:36.012]  He made no attempt to call me.
[02:25:36.012 --> 02:25:38.634]  Now, let me tell you about another thing that happened.
[02:25:38.634 --> 02:25:40.696]  Go back to the Virginia Tech shooting.
[02:25:42.122 --> 02:26:02.891]  32 innocent lives were slaughtered at Virginia Tech, and just three days after the Virginia Tech massacre, I'm watching network television, and they ran a commercial for a video game where they show this cartoon character walking into his house, taking up a 1911 .45 automatic, screwing on a suppressor,
[02:26:03.579 --> 02:26:08.942]  And then walking outside and routinely shooting innocent people who walk by his house.
[02:26:08.942 --> 02:26:10.363]  No, I know.
[02:26:10.363 --> 02:26:11.964]  And there's a big video game lobby.
[02:26:11.964 --> 02:26:20.709]  Whenever I say video games are connected to mass murder, they were developed to make troops not hesitate and pull the trigger after Vietnam had issues.
[02:26:20.709 --> 02:26:24.412]  And I'm not saying ban the video games, but it's absolutely a fact.
[02:26:24.412 --> 02:26:26.473]  And they go, don't censor our video games.
[02:26:26.473 --> 02:26:28.434]  Look, I'm not censoring your video games.
[02:26:28.434 --> 02:26:29.455]  I'm saying these aren't
[02:26:31.002 --> 02:26:37.368]  Military training games, and you put a mentally ill person on them, they're going to turn into a psychotic.
[02:26:37.368 --> 02:26:44.775]  And they're contributing factors to these head cases that go around, because the thing you have to ask... It pushes them over the edge.
[02:26:44.775 --> 02:26:45.976]  It pushes them over the edge.
[02:26:45.976 --> 02:26:46.556]  Right.
[02:26:46.556 --> 02:26:52.642]  Now have your reporters ask the mainstream media types who are going to be covering this thing in Santa Fe.
[02:26:52.642 --> 02:26:53.643]  Ask them one question.
[02:26:54.284 --> 02:27:04.397]  Give us the name of one murderer, rapist, armed robber, drug dealer, gangbanger, head case, terrorist, or school shooter who obeys gun laws.
[02:27:04.397 --> 02:27:05.659]  Give us their names.
[02:27:05.659 --> 02:27:08.202]  I was about to say, I want to have a press conference tonight.
[02:27:09.578 --> 02:27:09.978]  I don't
[02:27:25.666 --> 02:27:34.768]  And also go out and canvas the locals and get these eyewitnesses, because we may not get it on tape, but you may shoot it on your smartphone, put it on YouTube, you know, of key information.
[02:27:34.768 --> 02:27:37.108]  And again, we're not saying this got staged.
[02:27:37.108 --> 02:27:38.328]  We're not saying it's a false flag.
[02:27:38.328 --> 02:27:41.509]  We're not saying it was a police stand down, because we're not getting early reports of that.
[02:27:41.509 --> 02:27:43.189]  Looks like the police went right in.
[02:27:43.189 --> 02:27:46.410]  What we are saying is the Democrats are going to canvas these people.
[02:27:46.410 --> 02:27:51.570]  They're going to pick a few anti-gun folks who will then be the spokespersons for the entire school.
[02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.511]  We need... Well, that's the way they always did.
[02:27:54.691 --> 02:27:58.654]  Go back to early, oh gosh, 1983.
[02:27:58.654 --> 02:28:11.904]  I was living in Houston at the time, and the EPA came to town, and they wanted, in order to reduce air pollution, they wanted all Houstonians to drive 75% fewer miles.
[02:28:11.904 --> 02:28:17.789]  Now, they never said how you were going to get to work, or get to school, or get your shopping done, or anything else.
[02:28:17.789 --> 02:28:24.034]  And then, despite the fact that hundreds of us packed the auditorium there at the Marriott in South Houston,
[02:28:24.861 --> 02:28:29.303]  They then picked a few people as change agents that they claimed represented you.
[02:28:29.303 --> 02:28:37.168]  One woman from the League of Women Voters and a young punk from the Sierra Club who favored the EPA proposals.
[02:28:37.168 --> 02:28:38.028]  No, I know.
[02:28:38.028 --> 02:28:40.369]  They go out and they act like... It's called the Delphi Technique.
[02:28:40.369 --> 02:28:44.712]  They have a public event, they act like they're listening to you, then they cherry-pick who represents you.
[02:28:44.712 --> 02:28:45.372]  That's it.
[02:28:45.372 --> 02:28:49.254]  Don't let gun grabbers in Santa Fe represent Texas, folks.

[02:31:55.934 --> 02:32:03.560]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:11.486]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:11.486 --> 02:32:14.569]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:15.189 --> 02:32:19.854]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:19.854 --> 02:32:23.978]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:23.978 --> 02:32:27.122]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:27.122 --> 02:32:31.887]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:31.887 --> 02:32:34.930]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:35.350 --> 02:32:50.421]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:50.421 --> 02:32:51.963]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:51.963 --> 02:32:59.288]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:32:59.288 --> 02:33:01.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.857 --> 02:33:22.666]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.666 --> 02:33:27.453]  Strange days have found us.
[02:33:32.652 --> 02:33:37.379]  We're learning about a new plan the Trump administration is set to propose today.
[02:33:37.379 --> 02:33:38.641]  This is important.
[02:33:38.641 --> 02:33:42.145]  New restrictions on abortion and clinics which provide them.
[02:33:42.145 --> 02:33:45.129]  Let's go back to Kristen Welker at the White House who's been following this closely.
[02:33:45.129 --> 02:33:45.870]  Kristen, what have you got?
[02:33:46.608 --> 02:33:48.391]  Significant development, Ali.
[02:33:48.391 --> 02:34:03.972]  The Trump administration expected to announce later today that it will limit federal funding, essentially block federal funding from clinics that offer abortion services or that refer patients to other clinics.
[02:34:04.452 --> 02:34:06.615]  For those purposes.
[02:34:06.615 --> 02:34:08.497]  Now, why is this being done?
[02:34:08.497 --> 02:34:12.501]  Well, the White House says this is a campaign promise made, a campaign promise kept.
[02:34:12.501 --> 02:34:18.548]  A White House official telling me Donald Trump ran as a pro-life candidate and has governed as a pro-life president.
[02:34:18.548 --> 02:34:21.071]  Another promise made and kept.
[02:34:21.071 --> 02:34:22.593]  Essentially saying look,
[02:34:23.453 --> 02:34:27.796]  This is something that the President is following through with, that he promised out on the campaign.
[02:34:27.796 --> 02:34:31.239]  It's something that conservatives, his base, are cheering, Ali.
[02:34:31.239 --> 02:34:34.461]  This is a move that they wanted to see take place.
[02:34:34.461 --> 02:34:36.863]  And of course it comes ahead of the midterms.
[02:34:36.863 --> 02:34:43.067]  There's a lot of concern within the Republican ranks that they're going to lose key seats, that they may even lose the House of Representatives.
[02:34:43.067 --> 02:34:46.469]  This is one more data point that this White House, that Republicans could use.
[02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:48.931]  Out on the campaign trail.
[02:34:48.931 --> 02:34:53.093]  On the other hand, you have a lot of opposition to this move.
[02:34:53.093 --> 02:35:00.657]  Planned Parenthood, the Executive Vice President, saying simply, this is an attempt to take away basic rights, period.
[02:35:00.657 --> 02:35:07.400]  So expect a strong backlash by those who say it limits the ability of places like Planned Parenthood
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.261]  50 plus percent of black people never make it out of their mama's womb.
[02:35:39.462 --> 02:35:44.005]  But liberals will attack me for not using whatever the new term is for somebody.
[02:35:44.005 --> 02:35:51.730]  I literally, at a spiritual level, feel horrible about any child being chopped up, fighting for its life, with chemicals sprayed onto it, or scalpels.
[02:35:51.730 --> 02:35:55.453]  I mean, I've talked to the doctors, it's been in the news, the babies fight for their lives.
[02:35:56.584 --> 02:36:01.029]  One of our crew members' brother had a baby that died two weeks before tournament.
[02:36:01.029 --> 02:36:05.855]  It got an umbilical cord wrapped around its neck and they said the baby had fought to get out of it.
[02:36:05.855 --> 02:36:10.220]  I've got four children and you know you see Spike Lee shaking in hate for Trump.
[02:36:11.633 --> 02:36:12.053]  We're good to go.
[02:36:29.548 --> 02:36:32.711]  And that's why they hate him so much, folks, and it's a magic moment.
[02:36:32.711 --> 02:36:35.393]  You know, I really appreciate Reverend Leonard Childress coming on.
[02:36:35.393 --> 02:36:36.835]  He used to come on all the time.
[02:36:36.835 --> 02:36:38.596]  Time passes, we get busy.
[02:36:38.596 --> 02:36:43.481]  He was nice to let him move him back an hour because of the tragic mass shooting with a devil worshiper.
[02:36:43.481 --> 02:36:46.283]  I predict that hour one will be a devil worshiper, because it always is.
[02:36:46.283 --> 02:36:48.045]  They try to cover it up with this guy.
[02:36:48.045 --> 02:36:51.608]  Pentagrams, devil worship, shoot-em-up games, it's always the same thing.
[02:36:52.449 --> 02:36:58.571]  But he's the Pastor Clenard Howard Childress, author, filmmaker, blackgenocide.org.
[02:36:58.571 --> 02:37:02.692]  I'm not going to go over all his diplomas or background or what he fights with the films he's made.
[02:37:02.692 --> 02:37:10.133]  Now he goes to Congress and tries to get the Black Caucus to actually come out and, you know, get people to actually talk about the real black genocide going on.
[02:37:10.133 --> 02:37:12.954]  It's a genocide period, but it's particularly targeting blacks.
[02:37:12.954 --> 02:37:14.995]  The blacks are 13% of the population.
[02:37:14.995 --> 02:37:15.575]  They're half.
[02:37:16.533 --> 02:37:25.086]  Last time I checked, the abortion's in this country and I'll sit there when some crazy leftist white person, black person's in my face calling me a racist because I support Trump.
[02:37:25.086 --> 02:37:26.008]  Spitting in my face!
[02:37:27.383 --> 02:37:27.543]  I don't
[02:37:47.609 --> 02:37:56.817]  I'm bad or they can say that Candace Owens is bad or they can say that anybody who supports the president is all these evil things when I don't know what planet they're living on.
[02:37:56.817 --> 02:37:59.860]  Are they living on the same planet as us Reverend Leonard Childress?
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:03.263]  Because you're a leading expert on black genocide.
[02:38:03.263 --> 02:38:11.831]  Well no question the facts are beginning to come out and I really want to say thank you for all that you've done over this past year and a half of
[02:38:12.518 --> 02:38:16.359]  Making sure truth gets to the forefront of discussion.
[02:38:16.359 --> 02:38:23.402]  Giving Candace Owens, a very articulate young black woman, a space to share her mind, her heart.
[02:38:23.402 --> 02:38:27.123]  Who would ever think Kanye West would make the comments he made?
[02:38:27.123 --> 02:38:34.306]  But it's all coming now to the point of discussion and they know they lose.
[02:38:34.306 --> 02:38:38.267]  I never thought I would see America in this state at this present time.
[02:38:39.065 --> 02:38:44.788]  The vitriol, the hatred, the lies, the deceit, they're so blatant now.
[02:38:44.788 --> 02:38:47.649]  And it's really about power.
[02:38:47.649 --> 02:38:50.390]  They realize they're about to lose power.
[02:38:50.390 --> 02:39:03.396]  After Kanye West's comments, I don't know if it had anything to do with that, of Candace Owens, I like how she thinks, the polling for African Americans rose up to, I think amongst men, 22%.
[02:39:03.396 --> 02:39:04.136]  It doubled in support.
[02:39:06.694 --> 02:39:11.157]  Alex, they know it's over if that's the case.
[02:39:11.157 --> 02:39:12.998]  This cannot continue to grow.
[02:39:12.998 --> 02:39:14.459]  They will do anything.
[02:39:14.459 --> 02:39:17.480]  I'm scared for my family when they go out.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:21.903]  I am concerned about anyone who is speaking truth.
[02:39:21.903 --> 02:39:23.443]  They are so desperate.
[02:39:23.443 --> 02:39:24.744]  I never thought I'd see this.
[02:39:24.744 --> 02:39:26.785]  They are so desperate to stay in power.
[02:39:26.785 --> 02:39:27.526]  But quantify that.
[02:39:27.526 --> 02:39:29.647]  You talked about this a lot years ago.
[02:39:29.647 --> 02:39:30.067]  Blacks are 13%.
[02:39:30.067 --> 02:39:33.669]  They're a key tipping voting bloc for the Democrats.
[02:39:33.669 --> 02:39:35.090]  Without black folks, they have nothing.
[02:39:36.152 --> 02:39:38.278]  And they're realizing that now.
[02:39:38.278 --> 02:39:39.642]  Your listeners need to know.
[02:39:40.917 --> 02:39:42.838]  And you state it all the time.
[02:39:42.838 --> 02:39:45.320]  They're in utter panic right now.
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.881]  They're going to lose their minds.
[02:39:47.881 --> 02:39:50.443]  And I'm afraid to what's going to happen.
[02:39:50.443 --> 02:39:57.768]  And even the shooting today, it would not surprise me if there was somehow someone souped this guy's head up.
[02:39:57.768 --> 02:39:59.008]  Someone did something.
[02:39:59.008 --> 02:40:02.591]  I don't put anything past them at this point.
[02:40:02.591 --> 02:40:05.132]  Trump must be stopped.
[02:40:05.132 --> 02:40:09.395]  And now you have the Mueller investigation folding up like a piece of paper.
[02:40:10.035 --> 02:40:12.477]  He's he doesn't know what basically what to do.
[02:40:12.477 --> 02:40:14.758]  They were hanging their hat on that.
[02:40:14.758 --> 02:40:18.961]  And now you have a president who actually keeps his promise.
[02:40:18.961 --> 02:40:21.043]  Yes, he ran on a pro-life program.
[02:40:21.043 --> 02:40:31.009]  And no doubt, African-Americans are hearing these facts now that 12.4% of the population, but accounting for 36% of the abortions.
[02:40:31.009 --> 02:40:33.511]  I understand it's a little lower now, and I'm so happy to hear that.
[02:40:33.511 --> 02:40:37.614]  But I don't know if that's from either from chemical abortions, because they don't keep up.
[02:40:41.136 --> 02:40:47.761]  Well, in New York City, more babies are aborted than born in the African-American community.
[02:40:47.761 --> 02:40:51.164]  Philadelphia is the same way, L.A.
[02:40:51.164 --> 02:40:53.306]  and Chicago.
[02:40:53.306 --> 02:40:56.028]  I'm glad to hear those numbers since we talked a year ago, we're starting to drop some.
[02:40:56.846 --> 02:40:58.627]  They are starting to drop.
[02:40:58.627 --> 02:41:04.889]  It's programs like this that are beginning to take root, and they know it's taking root.
[02:41:04.889 --> 02:41:22.015]  It's amazing to me that unquestionably, as I walk the streets now, there's not this total allegiance to the party that is perceived to be the facilitator of the civil rights movement.
[02:41:22.015 --> 02:41:23.156]  They're now questioning.
[02:41:23.696 --> 02:41:28.379]  This is a great time for activists to be out, to be engaged.
[02:41:28.379 --> 02:41:31.581]  But like you said, they are scared and striking back.
[02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.662]  No, I'm really fearful, Alex.
[02:41:33.662 --> 02:41:34.803]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:41:34.803 --> 02:41:37.624]  They have to do something in order to stay in power.
[02:41:37.624 --> 02:41:39.606]  Trump has to be stopped.
[02:41:39.606 --> 02:41:42.407]  There has to be chaos in America.
[02:41:42.407 --> 02:41:44.408]  There has to be confusion.
[02:41:44.408 --> 02:41:51.613]  Anybody in their right mind that watches CNN, MSNBC can hear and see the total
[02:41:52.313 --> 02:41:54.874]  Total bias.
[02:41:54.874 --> 02:41:57.676]  Surely there's no question that journalism is dead.
[02:41:57.676 --> 02:41:59.236]  There's no objectivity.
[02:41:59.236 --> 02:42:03.839]  Give me the facts, let me choose, and let me then decide what I want to do.
[02:42:03.839 --> 02:42:11.002]  We can take on any forum in the country as long as we're given a voice, as long as we're able to present our case.
[02:42:11.002 --> 02:42:12.002]  Guess what?
[02:42:12.002 --> 02:42:12.903]  They don't want that.
[02:42:13.523 --> 02:42:14.423]  And this is scary.
[02:42:14.423 --> 02:42:17.964]  How can Berkeley censor free speech?
[02:42:17.964 --> 02:42:19.105]  I'm an old guy.
[02:42:19.105 --> 02:42:22.726]  I remember Berkeley being the citadel of free speech.
[02:42:22.726 --> 02:42:26.047]  How can they then attack a conservative speaker?
[02:42:26.047 --> 02:42:26.987]  We don't understand.
[02:42:26.987 --> 02:42:32.689]  The older voices often have to point this hypocrisy out without question.
[02:42:32.689 --> 02:42:36.890]  But black genocide is becoming a forefront of discussion.
[02:42:37.430 --> 02:42:42.858]  Black genocide is now coming to the point where it's a discussion in the African-American community.
[02:42:42.858 --> 02:42:45.342]  It's not where it should be, but it's cool.
[02:42:45.342 --> 02:42:46.444]  Well, thanks to you and others.
[02:42:46.444 --> 02:42:48.607]  I was about to say though, I watch YouTube just randomly.
[02:42:48.607 --> 02:42:51.250]  All these great voices are exposing it.
[02:42:51.250 --> 02:42:52.052]  It's amazing.
[02:42:55.123 --> 02:42:58.724]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:58.724 --> 02:43:00.504]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:43:00.504 --> 02:43:12.648]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.648 --> 02:43:21.290]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.730 --> 02:43:27.692]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:43:27.692 --> 02:43:32.793]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.793 --> 02:43:35.414]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.414 --> 02:43:37.115]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.115 --> 02:43:41.936]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:43:42.176 --> 02:43:47.124]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.124 --> 02:43:49.768]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.768 --> 02:43:55.277]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:46:53.569 --> 02:46:59.271]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:46:59.271 --> 02:47:07.394]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.394 --> 02:47:09.695]  While you were sleeping
[02:47:12.998 --> 02:47:16.419]  They came and took it all away.
[02:47:16.419 --> 02:47:19.440]  The lanes in the middle.
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:23.281]  The places where you used to play.
[02:47:23.281 --> 02:47:28.422]  It was an inside job by the well-considered
[02:47:34.770 --> 02:47:39.973]  We're back live, folks, and I really want to ask Reverend Childress to come back for a full hour sometime next week.
[02:47:39.973 --> 02:47:42.934]  We need to get him on every month anyways, the great work he's done.
[02:47:42.934 --> 02:47:47.316]  The books, the films, how he goes to Congress and demands they talk about real issues.
[02:47:47.316 --> 02:47:52.919]  And then you see these fake congressmen and women get up there and know they're diverting people from what they're really doing.
[02:47:52.919 --> 02:47:54.540]  It's sick.
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:56.701]  And this whole agenda
[02:47:57.625 --> 02:48:18.608]  To act like America wasn't abolitionist or Christian, to act like the Republicans didn't do the Civil Rights Act, not that they're perfect either, and just all of it turns down the Democrats as they flip everything into this whole race-based narrative, and then the litmus test is, okay, well then, you support, in many cities, the majority of black people never being born?
[02:48:19.696 --> 02:48:22.741]  And it's not like some virtue signaling I'm doing.
[02:48:22.741 --> 02:48:25.687]  None of us are safe, folks, if they can do this to anybody.
[02:48:25.687 --> 02:48:31.056]  And now Trump's moving to cut the funding off, to ban partial birth abortion, to move it back to the states where it's going to be banned.
[02:48:32.776 --> 02:48:35.897]  This is like Communist China, where they sell political dissidents organs.
[02:48:35.897 --> 02:48:38.639]  If we don't value our children, we're not going to value old people.
[02:48:38.639 --> 02:48:40.299]  We're not going to value anybody.
[02:48:40.299 --> 02:48:42.120]  And to see how conscious it is.
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:47.563]  And then the WikiLeaks that came out, where there's top professors advising Hillary, they go, we're losing control.
[02:48:47.563 --> 02:48:48.443]  And she goes, well, what do we do?
[02:48:48.443 --> 02:48:50.944]  And she goes, they go, culture war.
[02:48:50.944 --> 02:48:52.025]  That's another word for race war.
[02:48:52.845 --> 02:48:56.309]  And you see it and it's and then Kanye West sees through it.
[02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:58.832]  Anybody and they go, oh, you're just rich.
[02:48:58.832 --> 02:49:06.862]  That's why he's like, no, I'm not saying stuff isn't going on, but I'm transcending that and I'm not going to play into what they say I am in this whole game.
[02:49:06.862 --> 02:49:09.225]  And then the one thing they can't debate is black genocide.
[02:49:09.225 --> 02:49:11.708]  Like I said, I see all these people not even looking.
[02:49:12.588 --> 02:49:21.112]  Who are mainly really articulate, smart, black people, all over YouTube and stuff, just laying everything out that Reverend Childress says, Margaret Sanger, the whole fact.
[02:49:21.112 --> 02:49:28.435]  And they say, the litmus test is, I don't want to hear about, you know, somebody being racist to me or this or that, when it's some nebulous deal.
[02:49:28.435 --> 02:49:30.316]  How about this and the Democratic Party?
[02:49:30.316 --> 02:49:31.496]  And they don't know how to deal with it.
[02:49:31.496 --> 02:49:35.438]  So Reverend Childress, just, you've got a lot to say in the limited time we have.
[02:49:35.438 --> 02:49:38.940]  A snapshot then of where you think the world is today, and I agree,
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:49.312]  You can see their full power of this global system with the China one-child policy and the thing to genocide Africa and genocide the third world and they're trying to genocide Eastern Europe.
[02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:51.494]  They just are trying to knock everybody out.
[02:49:51.494 --> 02:49:52.716]  Soros is behind it.
[02:49:52.716 --> 02:49:55.960]  But I think humanity is awakening and I think that's what scares them.
[02:49:57.234 --> 02:49:57.815]  Absolutely.
[02:49:57.815 --> 02:50:18.053]  And let me just say to your listeners, black genocide is the key to overturning the ideology of this leftist liberalism, Marxism, socialism that is coming to America because they need the African American community to continue to support and sell out to this
[02:50:19.034 --> 02:50:19.734]  And let it be known
[02:50:47.328 --> 02:50:54.551]  White supremacy is so clearly seen in the abortion industry.
[02:50:54.551 --> 02:50:58.793]  Now, Margaret Sanger was a white supremacist.
[02:50:58.793 --> 02:51:05.756]  I dare anybody in this country to take me on on that, to have a simple debate.
[02:51:05.756 --> 02:51:08.117]  If you're going to break down... She wasn't just a supremacist!
[02:51:08.117 --> 02:51:10.919]  She said we've got to pull up the black weeds.
[02:51:10.919 --> 02:51:11.599]  Exactly.
[02:51:11.599 --> 02:51:13.180]  She was a genocidalist.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:20.345]  She and she collaborated with the Nazis in Germany.
[02:51:20.345 --> 02:51:24.529]  And unquestionably, and you know, most of our college students don't know this.
[02:51:24.529 --> 02:51:29.873]  When I'm traveling and I'm on college campuses, they have no idea of this.
[02:51:29.873 --> 02:51:31.515]  There has to be a grassroots.
[02:51:31.515 --> 02:51:37.720]  It will totally tip the scale because there's one thing this generation that's in school and college students right now.
[02:51:38.441 --> 02:51:42.411]  They don't want to be racist in any way, form, or fashion.
[02:51:42.411 --> 02:51:46.180]  They're so afraid of the word racist, but here it is without question.
[02:51:47.563 --> 02:51:50.685]  This woman was clearly a white supremacist.
[02:51:50.685 --> 02:51:57.748]  So why won't you demand her bus to be taken out of the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.?
[02:51:57.748 --> 02:52:06.192]  Why don't you demand the streets named after her, like in New York City, for that street to be renamed?
[02:52:06.192 --> 02:52:08.153]  Well, let's call it for what it is.
[02:52:08.153 --> 02:52:16.717]  Because right now, white males that show any sort of indifference towards African-American minorities
[02:52:17.117 --> 02:52:17.557]  I don't
[02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:40.773]  I want her out of our Smithsonian.
[02:52:40.773 --> 02:52:43.535]  I want her out of the public square.
[02:52:43.535 --> 02:52:44.977]  She stood for hatred.
[02:52:44.977 --> 02:52:51.402]  Well, like you said, Hitler wrote public letters and said that she was his Bible and they wrote each other letters.
[02:52:51.402 --> 02:52:54.004]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:52:54.004 --> 02:52:54.885]  Absolutely.
[02:52:54.885 --> 02:52:56.526]  And so let's have the discussion.
[02:52:56.526 --> 02:52:57.627]  But guess what?
[02:52:57.627 --> 02:52:59.509]  They don't want that discussion.
[02:52:59.509 --> 02:53:04.153]  Time Magazine's had her, what, Woman of the Year twice, even like a decade ago.
[02:53:04.153 --> 02:53:05.514]  They should apologize, but they won't.
[02:53:06.451 --> 02:53:08.032]  We gotta make them.
[02:53:08.032 --> 02:53:09.813]  Listen, I'm getting around.
[02:53:09.813 --> 02:53:11.914]  Resources are what they should be.
[02:53:11.914 --> 02:53:17.037]  But I am going to confront all of them publicly with our signage.
[02:53:17.037 --> 02:53:18.318]  We're gonna be out in front.
[02:53:18.318 --> 02:53:19.938]  We want an apology.
[02:53:19.938 --> 02:53:27.262]  Why would you ever endorse and propagate this woman's work and her doctrinal beliefs?
[02:53:27.262 --> 02:53:30.184]  How can you ever hold her in high esteem?
[02:53:30.184 --> 02:53:33.486]  Why is she over the top 100 influential people
[02:53:33.986 --> 02:53:34.547]  In the country.
[02:53:34.547 --> 02:53:38.490]  Now, she was, but not in the vein that you're saying.
[02:53:38.490 --> 02:53:39.911]  She was a brilliant strategist.
[02:53:39.911 --> 02:53:41.052]  She was evil.
[02:53:41.052 --> 02:53:42.113]  So, here we are.
[02:53:42.113 --> 02:53:43.594]  We want to call it for what it is.
[02:53:43.594 --> 02:53:48.018]  And of course, you know who funded her, the Rockefellers, who funded, they found her.
[02:53:48.018 --> 02:53:52.382]  They funded the Cold Springs Harbor that taught the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute everything.
[02:53:52.382 --> 02:53:53.743]  I mean, this is just a fact.
[02:53:53.743 --> 02:53:57.106]  She, the Rockefellers and Sanger basically created Hitler.
[02:53:58.089 --> 02:53:58.750]  Yes.
[02:53:58.750 --> 02:53:59.190]  Yes.
[02:53:59.190 --> 02:54:04.934]  And we need to, first of all, get everybody who's talking about they want their rights.
[02:54:04.934 --> 02:54:07.076]  They want basically equality.
[02:54:07.076 --> 02:54:08.317]  They want diversity.
[02:54:08.317 --> 02:54:08.897]  Okay.
[02:54:08.897 --> 02:54:11.119]  They didn't.
[02:54:11.119 --> 02:54:12.239]  Margaret Sanger didn't.
[02:54:12.239 --> 02:54:15.562]  She wanted them to be eliminated.
[02:54:16.425 --> 02:54:20.566]  Hitler got his ideas for concentration camps from her.
[02:54:20.566 --> 02:54:24.928]  So we gotta understand that we have the goods now.
[02:54:24.928 --> 02:54:26.188]  They are teetering.
[02:54:26.188 --> 02:54:28.389]  Please do not draw back.
[02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:31.890]  They are being tipped over at this point politically.
[02:54:31.890 --> 02:54:34.991]  And by the way, I've been interviewing you for probably 16, 17 years.
[02:54:34.991 --> 02:54:36.892]  I never heard you so positive.
[02:54:36.892 --> 02:54:38.592]  But I think you're right.
[02:54:38.592 --> 02:54:41.293]  I think that's why they're so panicked, is because this is all coming out.
[02:54:42.475 --> 02:54:43.636]  It's coming out.
[02:54:43.636 --> 02:54:48.160]  They know this is pivotal because it basically would say they would never back out of it.
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:49.762]  They supported this.
[02:54:49.762 --> 02:54:53.585]  It's a part of their platform.
[02:54:53.585 --> 02:54:54.366]  Okay.
[02:54:54.366 --> 02:54:57.809]  It's a part of their means of global control.
[02:54:57.809 --> 02:55:05.396]  And like you said, then they cover it up claiming they want to make everybody friendly when they're getting just average folks to fight with each other so they can come in with their whole agenda to be in charge.
[02:55:06.801 --> 02:55:08.282]  And that's never been new, by the way.
[02:55:08.282 --> 02:55:09.822]  We need to recognize that.
[02:55:09.822 --> 02:55:14.003]  So what is happening, I think is awesome.
[02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:16.264]  Trump is keeping his promises.
[02:55:16.264 --> 02:55:23.245]  We have to understand that we have a boss-site construction forming as a president, and that's refreshing.
[02:55:23.245 --> 02:55:28.307]  He's not going to come forth as the presidential adequate that everybody wants, but guess what?
[02:55:28.307 --> 02:55:29.967]  He gets the job done.
[02:55:30.547 --> 02:55:37.250]  Let this, if they give him just a smaller percentage of the support that they gave Barack Obama.
[02:55:37.250 --> 02:55:42.153]  Can you imagine where we would be if the media supported Trump?
[02:55:42.153 --> 02:55:42.633]  Oh my God.
[02:55:42.633 --> 02:55:43.793]  He'd be totally turned around.
[02:55:43.793 --> 02:55:45.854]  Oh my Lord.
[02:55:45.854 --> 02:55:47.055]  So he's done this.
[02:55:47.655 --> 02:55:55.582]  Against insurmountable odds, to be quite honest with you, I did not think he would survive with all the factions against him.
[02:55:55.582 --> 02:55:58.965]  I was shocked at the depth of corruption and deception.
[02:55:58.965 --> 02:56:01.967]  I think it's people like you praying for him.
[02:56:01.967 --> 02:56:04.089]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:56:04.089 --> 02:56:05.190]  I have proof.
[02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:09.133]  I shut my church down for two days, Alex, to God.
[02:56:09.133 --> 02:56:11.495]  Two days before the election, the Lord said to me,
[02:56:12.438 --> 02:56:16.379]  He will win, but you have to pray that they don't take it from him.
[02:56:16.379 --> 02:56:21.301]  I thought he was talking about, you know, fooling around with the numbers on Election Day.
[02:56:21.301 --> 02:56:22.061]  Hold on, this is powerful.
[02:56:22.061 --> 02:56:25.603]  We'll do five more minutes with Reverend Shoulders, who, by the way, get him on every month and we'll come on.
[02:56:25.603 --> 02:56:29.524]  We just got to put it in the calendar, because a year goes by and I'm like, one of my favorite guests, he's so busy.
[02:56:29.524 --> 02:56:33.365]  I want to talk about his films, his books, all of it, because it's so critical.
[02:56:33.365 --> 02:56:35.386]  Speaking of films and books, I got to plan my operation.
[02:56:35.586 --> 02:56:36.828]  I hardly ever plug.
[02:56:36.828 --> 02:56:38.690]  Soros and Hillary are openly suing me.
[02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:39.812]  They're trying to shut me down.
[02:56:39.812 --> 02:56:40.353]  We're strong.
[02:56:40.353 --> 02:56:42.475]  We're going to be okay as long as you stand with us.
[02:56:42.475 --> 02:56:43.076]  What do we sell?
[02:56:43.076 --> 02:56:45.720]  Fluoride-free toothpaste, 4 to 5 o'clock, a little silver and iodine.
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.342]  Everybody needs it.
[02:56:47.342 --> 02:56:47.903]  50% off right now.
[02:56:47.903 --> 02:56:49.004]  That sale's going to end on Monday.
[02:56:50.047 --> 02:56:54.669]  We've got the turmeric, 95% curcumin and super strong, that's 50% off.
[02:56:54.669 --> 02:56:57.869]  X2, the good halogen, that counters the bad fluoride.
[02:56:57.869 --> 02:56:59.930]  It's the good halogen.
[02:56:59.930 --> 02:57:02.271]  Iodine, that's 25% off.
[02:57:02.271 --> 02:57:07.452]  We've got pre-order, The Killing of Uncle Sam by Pastor Brown, who was in the studio with us yesterday.
[02:57:07.452 --> 02:57:07.973]  It's powerful.
[02:57:07.973 --> 02:57:09.073]  It starts shipping out next week.
[02:57:09.073 --> 02:57:10.013]  It's all there.
[02:57:10.013 --> 02:57:16.115]  If you'll just support us financially and spread the articles and the videos by hand, we will defeat Soros and Hillary.
[02:57:16.115 --> 02:57:18.896]  But I'm not going to lie to you, they put a knot on my head.
[02:57:19.236 --> 02:57:23.459]  I mean, they are really trying to stomp us into the ground, but we're going to move forward.
[02:57:23.459 --> 02:57:26.001]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:26.001 --> 02:57:29.524]  Be sure to check out the books and films at blackgenocide.org.
[02:57:29.524 --> 02:57:33.708]  We'll be back to talk about the pastor praying and what God told him.
[02:57:33.708 --> 02:57:34.448]  He didn't understand it.
[02:57:34.448 --> 02:57:36.590]  Like, he's going to win, but don't let him take it.
[02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:38.431]  Well, they're trying to take it right now.
[02:57:38.431 --> 02:57:39.132]  We'll be back.
[02:57:39.132 --> 02:57:39.752]  Stay with us.
[02:57:39.752 --> 02:57:41.534]  Hour number four, two minutes away.
[02:57:45.404 --> 02:57:49.067]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[02:58:46.122 --> 02:59:04.973]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[02:59:05.313 --> 02:59:06.093]  The revolution.
[02:59:06.093 --> 02:59:08.214]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.214 --> 02:59:11.935]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:11.935 --> 02:59:19.458]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.458 --> 02:59:21.838]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:21.838 --> 02:59:24.499]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:59:24.499 --> 02:59:25.419]  That's my dad.
[02:59:25.419 --> 02:59:27.280]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:28.861]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:28.861 --> 02:59:30.441]  And you're purchasing the products
[02:59:33.542 --> 02:59:38.946]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:59:38.946 --> 02:59:49.334]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:49.334 --> 02:59:56.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.020 --> 03:00:00.343]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[03:00:01.135 --> 03:00:04.576]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[03:00:04.576 --> 03:00:06.836]  This is not a new world.
[03:00:06.836 --> 03:00:11.217]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[03:00:11.217 --> 03:00:18.718]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[03:00:18.718 --> 03:00:26.540]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[03:00:27.689 --> 03:00:33.414]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[03:00:33.414 --> 03:00:35.555]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[03:00:35.555 --> 03:00:45.664]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:45.664 --> 03:00:49.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:58.442 --> 03:01:04.506]  Alright, he's loaded for bear coming up to break down the whole communist, globalist program and how that ties into it.
[03:01:04.506 --> 03:01:08.029]  Joel Gilbert's got a bunch of guests lined up, former communists, you name it.
[03:01:08.029 --> 03:01:11.531]  But finishing up with Reverend Shelder, so I want to invite back next week for a full hour, talk about what's happening.
[03:01:11.531 --> 03:01:17.095]  Get back into what happened right before the election, what God told you, and what you envisioned, and now where we are today.
[03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:20.450]  Well, basically, certainly.
[03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:26.672]  Trump caught everybody's surprise the year prior, and it came to me that this was the Lord's choice.
[03:01:26.672 --> 03:01:29.512]  I'm not the only person that said this.
[03:01:29.512 --> 03:01:45.676]  And two days before the election, I was praying, and the Lord said for me to have the church pray with you all night prayer for two nights that he had won.
[03:01:46.385 --> 03:01:52.568]  That Donald Trump won the election, but they would try to take it from him.
[03:01:52.568 --> 03:02:00.772]  My naive self, not having any idea what the depths of what God was saying, I'm figuring, okay, they're going to mess with the numbers that night.
[03:02:00.772 --> 03:02:04.354]  We got to pray that they don't take it from him.
[03:02:04.354 --> 03:02:05.915]  He said they're going to try to take it from him.
[03:02:05.915 --> 03:02:08.616]  Well, they tried that too, but you're right, that after is when it really came.
[03:02:09.509 --> 03:02:09.970]  Right.
[03:02:09.970 --> 03:02:15.895]  And I was just totally stunned at the revelation as I saw things unfolding.
[03:02:15.895 --> 03:02:18.898]  Strzok, Page, our own Brennan.
[03:02:18.898 --> 03:02:23.722]  I mean, this I could not believe this, that they were actually here.
[03:02:23.722 --> 03:02:25.164]  You have a sitting president.
[03:02:25.744 --> 03:02:37.533]  I really naively thought everybody would go to their respective corners, they would wait his term out, and basically, you know, there'd be resistance, but not to the degree.
[03:02:37.533 --> 03:02:40.435]  I didn't know there was a plan B to take him out.
[03:02:40.435 --> 03:02:46.259]  This was crazy, but it just fell into line to what the Lord had laid on my heart.
[03:02:46.259 --> 03:02:48.241]  And we continue to do that once a month.
[03:02:48.901 --> 03:02:49.202]  Okay.
[03:03:03.797 --> 03:03:09.401]  By the way, the night, I felt the same thing in my gut, my spirit, which the older I get, I learn to always go with.
[03:03:09.401 --> 03:03:12.564]  When Roger Stone was right here and he won, I said, he was like, why are you upset?
[03:03:12.564 --> 03:03:15.466]  And I said, they're really going to come after us and him and everybody now.
[03:03:15.466 --> 03:03:17.308]  We just began the war.
[03:03:17.308 --> 03:03:18.969]  Like, they thought they were in power.
[03:03:18.969 --> 03:03:19.970]  They're going to flip out now.
[03:03:19.970 --> 03:03:22.232]  And I just said, I can feel their hatred.
[03:03:22.232 --> 03:03:24.654]  And I could just, I just knew that it was coming.
[03:03:25.698 --> 03:03:27.060]  Alex, there's no question.
[03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:34.931]  I mean, you'll never receive the accolades and the rewards that your program has done to save America.
[03:03:34.931 --> 03:03:36.353]  It was just unquestionable.
[03:03:36.353 --> 03:03:37.135]  I love the way
[03:03:39.114 --> 03:03:56.002]  That they tried to make you to be some obscure source of relevant news, and it proved to be something that was totally, as you said, something that the grassroots, they were shocked at the power of the grassroots movement through this program.
[03:03:56.002 --> 03:03:59.183]  And other programs start taking your cue.
[03:03:59.183 --> 03:04:02.365]  I've always been a supporter, but I never really thought that the weight
[03:04:02.965 --> 03:04:06.730]  of the country would be on this program, as well as others.
[03:04:06.730 --> 03:04:08.832]  I thank God for... No, you too.
[03:04:08.832 --> 03:04:09.633]  It's everybody together.
[03:04:09.633 --> 03:04:14.319]  It's all of us together, went over the edge, and this is our little reprieve if we don't make it happen.
[03:04:14.319 --> 03:04:16.722]  I know you're a busy man, but please come back for a full hour.
[03:04:16.722 --> 03:04:18.063]  Thanks for letting us move you back.
[03:04:18.063 --> 03:04:19.345]  Sorry about having to do that for the shooting.
[03:04:20.106 --> 03:04:21.427]  Oh, I know you got to do your job.
[03:04:21.427 --> 03:04:24.789]  No problem at all, and grateful to be on the program anytime you'd have me.
[03:04:24.789 --> 03:04:26.030]  blackgenocide.org.
[03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:30.653]  I wonder about the books, the films, all of it, to really educate people, because you and I both know this stuff.
[03:04:30.653 --> 03:04:32.535]  We kind of think, or I kind of think everybody knows it.
[03:04:32.535 --> 03:04:35.697]  We got to keep, at least for a few months, repeating it for the new audiences.
[03:04:35.697 --> 03:04:41.701]  So please join us to get into the whole history of black genocide and the whole plan as a beta test for all of humanity.
[03:04:41.701 --> 03:04:42.622]  God bless you, Reverend.
[03:04:44.091 --> 03:04:46.433]  Alright, coming up, Joel Gilbert on the other side.
[03:04:46.433 --> 03:04:48.455]  Like I said, loaded for bear, he's ready to go.
[03:04:48.455 --> 03:04:50.436]  And then we're going to announce a press conference.
[03:04:50.436 --> 03:04:51.517]  I'll do that briefly when we come back.
[03:04:51.517 --> 03:04:53.659]  There's a press conference in Santa Fe tonight.
[03:04:54.778 --> 03:04:55.578]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:55.578 --> 03:05:05.720]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:14.222]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:14.222 --> 03:05:23.024]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:25.117 --> 03:05:44.705]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:44.705 --> 03:05:47.366]  It is amazing!
[03:05:47.366 --> 03:05:52.348]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:05:57.722 --> 03:06:02.607]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:02.607 --> 03:06:04.088]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.541 --> 03:06:24.865]  All right, Joel Gilbert, a documentary filmmaker, author, researcher, he's taking over in just a minute or two.
[03:06:24.865 --> 03:06:30.670]  Owen Schroyer, as we speak, is arriving in Santa Fe, Texas, a site of at least, unfortunately, 11 dead.
[03:06:32.555 --> 03:06:35.617]  Another school shooting, the Democrats blaming Trump, blaming the Second Amendment.
[03:06:35.617 --> 03:06:43.002]  I'm not taking from their loss, but thousands die every year drowning in pools, thousands more in lakes, thousands in jet ski accidents.
[03:06:43.002 --> 03:06:49.666]  A big plane blew up, crashed on takeoff with 109 people from Cuba outside Havana.
[03:06:49.666 --> 03:06:51.508]  There's a seven and a half billion of us.
[03:06:51.508 --> 03:06:53.729]  We come in, we come out of the world.
[03:06:53.729 --> 03:06:57.572]  This guy appears to be a devil worshipper wearing a communist lapel pin.
[03:07:00.086 --> 03:07:13.250]  We're going to go live, we're live now but in about 50 minutes, with The War Room, with Owen Schroyer, Roger Stone, myself, Owen and Drew and the crew are down in South Texas.
[03:07:13.250 --> 03:07:22.032]  But coming up at 6 p.m., if you look at a map on Google Earth of the school,
[03:07:23.669 --> 03:07:32.479]  Just two streets down towards the east is Maple and Tower, and we know that that's right now where the police have things blocked.
[03:07:32.479 --> 03:07:35.383]  If you get there and they're blocked out further, I wouldn't expect that.
[03:07:35.383 --> 03:07:39.748]  I'd imagine the perimeter will go in, as they understand there's not other shooters.
[03:07:39.748 --> 03:07:42.251]  Though they say you had IEDs and accomplices, who knows?
[03:07:43.089 --> 03:07:48.373]  But Owen Schroer at Maple and Tower tonight, six o'clock, a press conference.
[03:07:48.373 --> 03:08:07.847]  And the press conference will be Owen talking to the callers we already had, and we checked who they were, from Santa Fe, reporting on this guy being known, that he was a devil worshiper, that there was a stand-down, not by the police, but a stand-down by mental health and others, just like we saw in Parkland with
[03:08:09.198 --> 03:08:20.046]  Nicholas Cruz, who we now know is part of this anti-racism program where he could commit burglaries and vandalism and threaten to kill people and never went to jail because his last name was Cruz, even though he was adopted.
[03:08:20.046 --> 03:08:25.711]  He was a white person adopted by Hispanics who died before he died and before this event happened.
[03:08:25.711 --> 03:08:26.891]  So Maple and Tower, 6 p.m.
[03:08:26.891 --> 03:08:27.192]  tonight.
[03:08:29.253 --> 03:08:33.895]  Uh, if something happens, just look, you know, down the street from that or up the street.
[03:08:33.895 --> 03:08:38.917]  You'll find Owen either up Maple or up Tower at the next checkpoint.
[03:08:38.917 --> 03:08:42.439]  But right now, the checkpoints are basically up from that.
[03:08:42.439 --> 03:08:45.120]  So we've picked Maple and Tower 6 p.m.
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:51.263]  If you are a parent or one of the surviving students or one of the victims,
[03:08:52.401 --> 03:08:59.905]  Don't wait for the Democrats to show up and canvas the 3,000 plus students, big high school, and pick four or five that are anti-gun to say they represent you.
[03:08:59.905 --> 03:09:13.293]  If you want a voice on Infowars, and a voice so Fox News and others can see, hey, here's who to be interviewed, to give their view that, hey, we don't want our guns taken, because right now they're going to misrepresent you, they're going to send in the
[03:09:15.447 --> 03:09:21.551]  Million Mom March, the George Soros groups that fund these current groups, so they're going to take this over.
[03:09:21.551 --> 03:09:28.415]  So, we don't want to just sit back here and let them claim they represent the people of Santa Fe and the Texans down there.
[03:09:28.415 --> 03:09:30.877]  So, Owen Schroyer is there.
[03:09:30.877 --> 03:09:38.582]  And, we've already had more than a dozen parents and others say they're going to be there, but if you live in Houston and you've got a view on this, or surrounding areas, or Galveston,
[03:09:39.602 --> 03:09:43.545]  You want to be there to support Owen Schroer and what he's doing in the corner of Maple and Tower.
[03:09:43.545 --> 03:09:46.227]  I'll put a tweet out on Real Alex Jones.
[03:09:46.227 --> 03:09:55.955]  I'll have it retweeted on Prison Planet with Paul Watson that InfoWars is going to hold a press conference with victims, with citizens, with witnesses tonight.
[03:09:55.955 --> 03:09:56.595]  Six o'clock.
[03:09:56.595 --> 03:10:02.900]  So that's in roughly four hours or three hours and 51 minutes.
[03:10:02.900 --> 03:10:03.841]  Maple and Tower.
[03:10:07.332 --> 03:10:08.994]  You can also call us here.
[03:10:08.994 --> 03:10:10.536]  We'll relay your number to Owen Schroer.
[03:10:10.536 --> 03:10:23.150]  If you're an eyewitness or a parent or you want us to come to the hospital and visit with you and your family, that'd be powerful to interview, you know, hoping your children are doing well or just have a flesh wound or whatever, because the media is going to be trying to get into those other kids.
[03:10:23.530 --> 03:10:24.030]  The Globalist.
[03:10:24.030 --> 03:10:29.474]  If you want us to come in and talk to you respectfully, or talk to your family, or talk to any of the victims, we're ready right now.
[03:10:29.474 --> 03:10:32.896]  You can give us a call at 877-789-ALEX.
[03:10:32.896 --> 03:10:37.419]  We'll relay that and name a number to Owen Schroer and crew who are now arriving.
[03:10:37.419 --> 03:10:38.300]  So that is again...
[03:10:40.501 --> 03:10:43.242]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[03:10:43.242 --> 03:10:48.125]  Now, Joel Gilbert, award-winning filmmaker, researcher, takes over for the hour.
[03:10:48.125 --> 03:10:49.726]  He's loaded for bear, as I said.
[03:10:49.726 --> 03:10:53.808]  Thanks for letting me crash into what you're up to, but you understand we've got a lot of breaking news here.
[03:10:53.808 --> 03:10:58.290]  But you're covering the ground level, though, of what we're facing, so thank you, Joel Gilbert.
[03:11:00.194 --> 03:11:00.915]  Absolutely.
[03:11:00.915 --> 03:11:01.555]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:11:01.555 --> 03:11:04.237]  We're going to do a great show here today.
[03:11:04.237 --> 03:11:16.404]  Coming up, we're going to have former KGB Lieutenant Colonel Konstantin Prebajinsky, an intelligence expert, and he's going to really explain to us the differences in the Russian mentality.
[03:11:16.404 --> 03:11:19.026]  The Russians don't think like Americans think.
[03:11:19.026 --> 03:11:23.649]  They have completely different ideas and goals and values.
[03:11:23.649 --> 03:11:25.650]  One thing he told me, which we'll get into, for example,
[03:11:26.798 --> 03:11:33.201]  He said that when America and the world put sanctions on Russia, it increases Putin's popularity.
[03:11:33.201 --> 03:11:41.326]  So in the West, Theresa May, of course, the Trump administration, they think, well, if they poison somebody, then we're going to put sanctions on them.
[03:11:41.326 --> 03:11:43.407]  And that'll teach him his lesson.
[03:11:43.407 --> 03:11:50.150]  In fact, Putin gains popularity when these kind of things happen.
[03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:52.131]  So we're going to talk to Constantine.
[03:11:52.131 --> 03:11:53.272]  He was very close to
[03:11:54.315 --> 03:12:02.320]  Litvinenko, who was poisoned and killed in England, he cannot go back to Russia right now, and he's going to really educate us.
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:05.122]  There he is in my film, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:12:05.122 --> 03:12:17.169]  He's going to give us a lot of education about how the Russians think, what they think of the Mueller probe, what they think of Obama, the Iran deal, and you're going to get a whole different world trying to understand the way the Russians are using all these things.
[03:12:17.169 --> 03:12:19.871]  Well, I know this guy's a high-profile guest, so I'm really impressed you've got him coming on.
[03:12:19.871 --> 03:12:21.612]  This is important information.
[03:12:22.893 --> 03:12:23.353]  Exactly.
[03:12:23.353 --> 03:12:24.694]  So we'll have him up here.
[03:12:24.694 --> 03:12:26.276]  He's written several books.
[03:12:26.276 --> 03:12:29.498]  He's somebody that was inside the KGB.
[03:12:29.498 --> 03:12:33.761]  He was a recruiter for the Russians in Japan during the Cold War.
[03:12:33.761 --> 03:12:41.426]  He would recruit Chinese students and Japanese until he was eventually caught and thrown out of Japan.
[03:12:41.426 --> 03:12:44.168]  Ended up going back to Russia and defecting to the United States in 2006.
[03:12:44.168 --> 03:12:48.491]  So you're going to learn things that you never even understood.
[03:12:49.776 --> 03:12:52.718]  The way that the Russian intelligence operates.
[03:12:52.718 --> 03:12:55.799]  He's going to talk about the Steele dossier.
[03:12:55.799 --> 03:12:59.261]  Whether that was even an intelligence document or just a big joke.
[03:12:59.261 --> 03:13:03.303]  So Konstantin Prebojensky coming up, you know, Alex, right after the break.
[03:13:03.303 --> 03:13:09.946]  And we look forward also to Newsnight later to see what they're coming up with in the school shooting.
[03:13:09.946 --> 03:13:16.269]  I hope that Oliver North, who now is taking over the NRA, I hope he does a much better job than this guy.
[03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:18.310]  LaPierre always did a poor job, I thought.
[03:13:19.016 --> 03:13:22.008]  Defending the NRA, Oliver North needs to come on and say, listen,
[03:13:22.799 --> 03:13:24.299]  NRA is even more important now.
[03:13:24.299 --> 03:13:25.760]  We're about self-defense.
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:27.480]  We're about gun safety.
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:28.480]  Oh, I totally agree.
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:35.002]  You know, LaPierre's not perfect, not as good as Heston, but say what you want about Oliver North.
[03:13:35.002 --> 03:13:36.162]  He's hardcore.
[03:13:36.162 --> 03:13:44.664]  He says this is persecution of America, attack on our basic rights, and people trying to say get rid of our Second Amendment are terrorists because they're not engaging in free speech.
[03:13:44.664 --> 03:13:47.384]  They're trying to repeal the bedrock of the country.
[03:13:47.384 --> 03:13:50.645]  So, I'm very excited about Oliver North, actually.
[03:13:51.869 --> 03:14:00.015]  Actually being there, you know, I used to interview him all the time and once got a bunch of negative questions for him and, you know, about all the stuff that happened in Central and South America.
[03:14:00.015 --> 03:14:01.916]  He said, listen, I'm not a traitor to my country.
[03:14:01.916 --> 03:14:02.817]  I do what I was supposed to.
[03:14:02.817 --> 03:14:03.818]  Well, I get that.
[03:14:03.818 --> 03:14:05.239]  I was only asking hard questions.
[03:14:05.239 --> 03:14:09.602]  But, you know, we now see the Democrats had a whole plan to collapse all the way up to the U.S.
[03:14:09.602 --> 03:14:12.024]  with communists and then collapse the U.S.
[03:14:12.024 --> 03:14:14.786]  If communists have one thing, they certainly think big.
[03:14:17.275 --> 03:14:20.357]  They have an agenda which is complete.
[03:14:20.357 --> 03:14:22.037]  It represents the total domain.
[03:14:22.037 --> 03:14:24.999]  It has so much in common with Islamism.
[03:14:24.999 --> 03:14:28.881]  Islamists and leftists both have a passion for destruction.
[03:14:28.881 --> 03:14:31.342]  They have a passion for taking over everything.
[03:14:31.342 --> 03:14:35.864]  They have a passion for complete control of everyone's lives.
[03:14:35.864 --> 03:14:42.107]  They don't get the western ethos of renaissance that explodes with productivity and success.
[03:14:42.107 --> 03:14:44.848]  Don't they get if you turn people loose, that's what creates all the wealth?
[03:14:46.932 --> 03:14:48.273]  They're still in denial.
[03:14:48.273 --> 03:15:08.263]  They cannot accept that their vision for the perfect world, for utopia, for making the world a better place with the government in control, taking all your property, giving out jobs and giving out money, they cannot accept that their model for humanity is a complete disaster and they'll never go away.
[03:15:08.263 --> 03:15:12.985]  That's why it's so important to keep educating people about the truth and reality of
[03:15:13.485 --> 03:15:19.207]  Free markets versus this government-controlled socialism which leads on a path to nowhere.
[03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:22.388]  It creates a dystopia, not a utopia like your film.
[03:15:22.388 --> 03:15:24.188]  We carry all your films at infowarstore.com.
[03:15:24.188 --> 03:15:30.230]  Joel Gilbert takes over on the other side with an exclusive interview with a former member of the KGB.
[03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:31.050]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:15:31.050 --> 03:15:35.792]  And then, in about 45 minutes, we kick off The War Room with Owen Schroyer live.
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:43.769]  Live from the tragic shooting space there in Santa Fe, South Texas.
[03:15:43.769 --> 03:15:45.871]  So pray for Owen and the rest of the crew out there.
[03:15:45.871 --> 03:15:46.652]  It's all coming up.
[03:15:46.652 --> 03:15:48.875]  Spread the live links that you see out there.
[03:15:48.875 --> 03:15:49.996]  That's how we reach new people.
[03:15:49.996 --> 03:15:51.538]  That is how we bypass the globalists.
[03:15:53.143 --> 03:15:54.684]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:54.684 --> 03:15:57.147]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[03:15:57.147 --> 03:15:59.849]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:15:59.849 --> 03:16:05.174]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.174 --> 03:16:10.659]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.839 --> 03:16:14.302]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[03:16:14.302 --> 03:16:17.405]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[03:18:57.060 --> 03:18:58.982]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:18:58.982 --> 03:19:08.312]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:19:09.179 --> 03:19:15.942]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:19:15.942 --> 03:19:18.203]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:19:18.203 --> 03:19:19.264]  Thank you.
[03:19:19.264 --> 03:19:21.745]  I use the BioTruth Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.

[03:19:26.067 --> 03:19:29.088]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:19:29.088 --> 03:19:30.409]  They are quality.

[03:19:32.149 --> 03:19:35.031]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:19:35.031 --> 03:19:35.611]  Absolutely.
[03:19:35.771 --> 03:19:56.705]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:19:56.705 --> 03:19:59.387]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.992 --> 03:20:08.833]  We are on the march.
[03:20:08.833 --> 03:20:11.995]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:20:11.995 --> 03:20:21.021]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:20:21.021 --> 03:20:21.982]  Welcome back.
[03:20:21.982 --> 03:20:23.683]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:20:23.683 --> 03:20:25.204]  This is Joel Gilbert.
[03:20:25.204 --> 03:20:28.606]  I'm hosting this last hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:28.606 --> 03:20:33.849]  Don't forget to check out my new DVD in the Alex Jones store, of course.
[03:20:33.849 --> 03:20:35.170]  Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:20:35.851 --> 03:20:42.196]  You'll learn all about Trump, how he thinks, and you'll fall in love and laugh for 95 minutes over and over.
[03:20:42.196 --> 03:20:42.936]  It never gets old.
[03:20:42.936 --> 03:20:44.458]  Trust me.
[03:20:44.458 --> 03:20:48.221]  So be sure to go to the Alex Jones store for that DVD.
[03:20:48.221 --> 03:20:57.468]  I want to bring on my guest right now is former KGB officer Konstantin Grigorovich Priyabazhensky.
[03:20:57.468 --> 03:21:05.354]  Konstantin is a former KGB lieutenant colonel, an intelligence expert, and author of several books, including The Spy Who Loved Japan.
[03:21:06.443 --> 03:21:14.005]  KGB, new Trojan horse, and even a new book, An American Man's Guide to Russian Women.
[03:21:14.005 --> 03:21:21.208]  And I think if we understand Russian women, we can start talking about the mentality of the Russians.
[03:21:21.208 --> 03:21:29.510]  Now, some of you know Constantine from his appearance in my film, which is in the Alex Jones store also, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:31.791]  No Place Like Utopia, there he is.
[03:21:31.791 --> 03:21:35.812]  And I think we can learn a lot from him talking to a former KGB colonel.
[03:21:36.883 --> 03:21:41.469]  Konstantin Zdravstvuyte, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:44.533]  Zdravstvuyte, nice to see you, nice to see you again.
[03:21:44.533 --> 03:21:45.735]  Great to see you.
[03:21:45.735 --> 03:21:54.547]  Konstantin, first of all, before we talk about the book, what was your job in the KGB, and what exactly did you do undercover, and what was your cover in Japan?
[03:21:55.704 --> 03:22:09.416]  In Japan, I was covered as the correspondent of the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, and my task was to spy on China, mostly on China.
[03:22:09.416 --> 03:22:11.418]  And how did you spy on China?
[03:22:11.418 --> 03:22:13.420]  What did you do to recruit Chinese students?
[03:22:14.196 --> 03:22:16.398]  I just was recruiting them.
[03:22:16.398 --> 03:22:18.039]  It was, it's a great job.
[03:22:18.039 --> 03:22:23.022]  I was looking for the Chinese students, made some personal contact with them.
[03:22:23.022 --> 03:22:28.906]  Usually I said that I need a personal tutor of Chinese language.
[03:22:28.906 --> 03:22:29.967]  They agreed.
[03:22:30.547 --> 03:22:37.433]  And then I gave them $100 for this lesson, which is too much.
[03:22:37.433 --> 03:22:42.977]  The lesson took place in the restaurants, luxurious restaurants.
[03:22:42.977 --> 03:22:44.979]  At the time, Chinese students were very poor.
[03:22:47.066 --> 03:22:56.008]  I said mostly, oh, let's not do a lesson today, let's postpone it for the next time, but please take the honorarium.
[03:22:56.008 --> 03:23:01.769]  It made our relations very, just progress.
[03:23:01.769 --> 03:23:12.451]  And then, slowly but surely, they became agents or collaborators of our intelligence.
[03:23:12.451 --> 03:23:14.731]  It's the way all other intelligences
[03:23:15.231 --> 03:23:23.184]  Are you saying you were eventually arrested and kicked out of Japan, is that correct?
[03:23:23.184 --> 03:23:23.785]  What year was that?
[03:23:24.913 --> 03:23:26.473]  Yes, it was 1985.
[03:23:26.473 --> 03:23:36.116]  I was going to meet just a Chinese scholar whom I had recruited.
[03:23:36.116 --> 03:23:45.379]  But the Japanese police was waiting for me in the place of our meeting instead of himself.
[03:23:45.379 --> 03:23:47.979]  What occurred to him later, I don't know.
[03:23:47.979 --> 03:23:53.641]  I was forced to go to Russia, to Moscow, by my leadership, by KGB.
[03:23:55.141 --> 03:24:04.803]  Maybe it was better to go to police and talk there and explain or just hire a lawyer, but in the Soviet period it was impossible.
[03:24:04.803 --> 03:24:10.965]  I had to surrender and fulfill what I was ordered to do.
[03:24:10.965 --> 03:24:20.047]  Okay, Konstantin, so you are an expert and you've been very kind to explain to me the major differences in the mentality of Russians versus American mentality.
[03:24:20.863 --> 03:24:24.268]  And different ways of thinking completely on many issues.
[03:24:24.268 --> 03:24:37.286]  So let's let's before we get into the politics, let's take a look into the Russian mind by talking about your book on an American's guide to Russian women, because we saw with the Me Too movement.
[03:24:37.890 --> 03:24:42.552]  We saw, for instance, Eric Schneiderman, the New York Attorney General, in the news.
[03:24:42.552 --> 03:24:43.993]  This guy was completely corrupt.
[03:24:43.993 --> 03:24:49.055]  He's suing climate deniers, full-blown progressive agenda.
[03:24:49.055 --> 03:24:55.078]  It turns out Schneiderman is a hypocrite and resigns when it's revealed that he abused women he dated.
[03:24:55.078 --> 03:25:00.881]  So let's, to start understanding the Russian mentality, let's talk about your book,
[03:25:01.798 --> 03:25:05.780]  An American's Guide to Russian Women, before we talk about the politics.
[03:25:05.780 --> 03:25:10.583]  Now, the first chapter is titled, Sexual Harassment, Please.
[03:25:10.583 --> 03:25:15.025]  Explain why Russian women want to be sexually harassed.
[03:25:15.025 --> 03:25:20.768]  Because their mind totally differs.
[03:25:20.768 --> 03:25:24.790]  In Russia, sexual harassment is following.
[03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:28.952]  When a beat woman tried to rape her, leave some scars,
[03:25:30.155 --> 03:25:31.316]  Which can be proved.
[03:25:31.316 --> 03:25:33.097]  That is sexual harassment in Russia.
[03:25:33.097 --> 03:25:34.498]  Nothing more.
[03:25:34.498 --> 03:25:50.366]  And if you give woman some pleasant addresses, if you say how beautiful she is, how beautiful is her breast, and kisses her hand, and puts your hand on her knee, it's not sexual harassment at all.
[03:25:50.366 --> 03:25:51.246]  It's very pleasant.
[03:25:51.246 --> 03:25:53.608]  It's normal flirting with woman.
[03:25:53.608 --> 03:25:54.128]  In Russia,
[03:25:55.517 --> 03:26:06.545]  When a boss just expresses some sexual interest into his female subordinate, she's happy!
[03:26:06.545 --> 03:26:14.371]  Because traditionally, there is lack of men in Russia, and women are starving for men's attention.
[03:26:14.371 --> 03:26:19.514]  So just, I would advise American men to marry Russian women.
[03:26:19.514 --> 03:26:21.916]  They will never accuse you of sexual harassment.
[03:26:23.152 --> 03:26:26.735]  Okay, you said also in the book, Russian women are tired of feminism.
[03:26:26.735 --> 03:26:28.477]  Why is that?
[03:26:28.477 --> 03:26:33.081]  Because, in fact, there is very few feminists in Russia.
[03:26:33.081 --> 03:26:40.147]  In Russia, when a woman says that she is a feminist, we are laughing at her, saying, oh, you need a good boyfriend.
[03:26:40.147 --> 03:26:43.029]  Get a good boyfriend and all your feminists will go out.
[03:26:44.770 --> 03:26:49.614]  Traditionally, Russian women are worshipping men, respecting men.
[03:26:49.614 --> 03:26:58.040]  In Russia, for example, it is impossible for a wife to accuse her husband in rape, so-called rape and sex.
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:26:59.701]  There is no such law in Russia.
[03:26:59.701 --> 03:27:00.642]  Why so?
[03:27:00.642 --> 03:27:07.047]  Because Russian common man says the following, you have married your husband, you need to give him some pleasure.
[03:27:07.047 --> 03:27:09.749]  If you don't do this, what kind of wife are you?
[03:27:11.357 --> 03:27:16.300]  So why do, you also said Russian women actually want to be the weaker sex, not equal.
[03:27:16.300 --> 03:27:18.001]  Where does that come from?
[03:27:18.001 --> 03:27:21.103]  Yes, it comes from our Soviet history.
[03:27:21.103 --> 03:27:35.712]  In 1917, as you know, there was a revolution in the Soviet Union, and according to the ideology of newcomers, the communists, men and women became the same, were declared the same.
[03:27:36.292 --> 03:27:48.401]  Women were forced to do a hard man's job, especially during the war, the Second World War, when many men died after the war.
[03:27:48.401 --> 03:27:58.549]  So just when the communist period finished, they wanted to return to what it was before the revolution, when men were kissing women's hands.
[03:27:59.107 --> 03:27:59.367]  Okay, well...
[03:28:27.890 --> 03:28:32.192]  You're starting to give us a good insight into the Russian history and different mentality.
[03:28:32.192 --> 03:28:38.414]  We're going to get into the poisonings, the Mueller probe, Putin sanctions right after the break.
[03:28:38.414 --> 03:28:43.076]  We'll be back with former KGB Lieutenant Colonel Konstantin Preobrazhensky.
[03:28:43.076 --> 03:28:44.377]  We'll be right back on InfoWars.
[03:28:53.109 --> 03:28:54.009]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:54.009 --> 03:28:56.410]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:56.410 --> 03:29:04.531]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[03:29:23.257 --> 03:29:25.138]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:33:32.103 --> 03:33:35.145]  Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:33:35.145 --> 03:33:41.189]  We're getting back into our conversation with former KGB Lieutenant Colonel Konstantin Pirovezhensky.
[03:33:41.189 --> 03:33:44.372]  If you want to ask some questions later in the show, it's going to be 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:44.372 --> 03:33:44.432]  1-877-789-2539.
[03:33:52.152 --> 03:33:57.398]  We want to talk now with Konstantin about the sanctions against Russia.
[03:33:57.398 --> 03:34:02.062]  I understand Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London in 2006.
[03:34:02.062 --> 03:34:02.923]  He was poisoned.
[03:34:02.923 --> 03:34:05.165]  Was he a friend of yours?
[03:34:05.165 --> 03:34:10.811]  Yes, we never met, but we were speaking a lot over the phone.
[03:34:10.811 --> 03:34:14.535]  Yes, he was a friend of mine, and I was very sorry when he died.
[03:34:14.535 --> 03:34:15.716]  Yes, when he was poisoned.
[03:34:16.593 --> 03:34:18.675]  Was he in fear that he would be killed?
[03:34:18.675 --> 03:34:23.199]  And was he worried that the KGB was going to try to get rid of him?
[03:34:23.199 --> 03:34:25.381]  Yes, he was telling me that he was afraid, of course.
[03:34:25.381 --> 03:34:27.883]  He foresaw it to some extent.
[03:34:27.883 --> 03:34:30.865]  He told me that he was afraid.
[03:34:30.865 --> 03:34:35.329]  Why didn't Putin or the Russians just forgive him and forget about him?
[03:34:35.329 --> 03:34:37.691]  Tell me about the mentality of the Russians.
[03:34:37.691 --> 03:34:40.834]  Why wouldn't they just give up on him?
[03:34:40.834 --> 03:34:41.434]  On whom?
[03:34:41.434 --> 03:34:43.016]  On Litvinenko?
[03:34:43.016 --> 03:34:43.176]  Yes.
[03:34:44.482 --> 03:34:49.587]  Well, Litvinenko was very active in media.
[03:34:49.587 --> 03:34:54.452]  He was talking a lot about putting some negative information.
[03:34:54.452 --> 03:34:56.534]  Maybe he has irritated him.
[03:34:56.534 --> 03:35:05.903]  So just at the time, he was not keeping silence and was very, very active in his public writings and maybe speakings.
[03:35:07.173 --> 03:35:16.522]  Well, we just had the poisoning in England of the ex-spy Sergei Skripal, and that resulted in sanctions being placed by England, United States, and other allies.
[03:35:16.522 --> 03:35:21.507]  What effect do sanctions have on the Russian people and on Putin?
[03:35:21.507 --> 03:35:22.508]  Are they afraid of sanctions?
[03:35:23.514 --> 03:35:24.654]  I don't know.
[03:35:24.654 --> 03:35:25.774]  I don't know.
[03:35:25.774 --> 03:35:28.675]  But we are too far from this problem.
[03:35:28.675 --> 03:35:36.977]  But the Soviet Union has always been living under this or that kind of sanctions.
[03:35:36.977 --> 03:35:39.617]  Remember the sanctions of KOKOM soldiers?
[03:35:39.617 --> 03:35:45.978]  It's something natural, something not new at all for Russians.
[03:35:45.978 --> 03:35:48.679]  To say, afraid or not, usually
[03:35:49.765 --> 03:35:54.506]  Russians are not so much afraid of an exterior threat.
[03:35:54.506 --> 03:36:01.828]  And does it make Putin more popular or less popular when they have sanctions?
[03:36:01.828 --> 03:36:07.169]  Oh, I don't know, but judging by Russian media, it makes him more popular.
[03:36:07.169 --> 03:36:08.529]  Yes.
[03:36:08.529 --> 03:36:08.749]  I see.
[03:36:13.061 --> 03:36:19.984]  Does Russia, the Russian government, have the same concept in Russia of forgiveness as we have in the West and in America?
[03:36:19.984 --> 03:36:26.447]  Would they forgive and forget about someone who's a traitor, or do they always remember?
[03:36:26.447 --> 03:36:32.729]  I don't know about such a conception, such a concept of forgiveness.
[03:36:32.729 --> 03:36:34.210]  Here, I don't know.
[03:36:34.210 --> 03:36:36.591]  There's nothing to compare with.
[03:36:36.591 --> 03:36:41.433]  But I have no comment about this, I don't know this problem at all.
[03:36:42.535 --> 03:36:47.178]  Okay, let's talk about the Steele dossier that I think I sent you.
[03:36:47.178 --> 03:36:55.063]  And this is the dossier with the information that they're used against Trump to obtain FISA warrants and spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:36:55.063 --> 03:36:58.086]  You told me it was just foolish speculation.
[03:36:58.086 --> 03:37:03.829]  Why wasn't this something that was not an intelligence document?
[03:37:03.829 --> 03:37:05.150]  Why was it taken seriously?
[03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:06.111]  And what did you think about it?
[03:37:07.736 --> 03:37:19.384]  As far as my memory serves me right, there is only speculations, no direct facts, no just some secret facts, only the open information.
[03:37:19.384 --> 03:37:21.646]  So I didn't take it seriously.
[03:37:21.646 --> 03:37:23.327]  It looks like speculation.
[03:37:23.327 --> 03:37:27.890]  I was even laughing when I was reading it.
[03:37:27.890 --> 03:37:28.290]  Okay.
[03:37:30.177 --> 03:37:41.363]  You wrote the book called New Trojan Horse about Americans of Russian descent, especially working in the Russian Orthodox Church.
[03:37:41.363 --> 03:37:43.984]  Did the Cold War actually end?
[03:37:43.984 --> 03:37:46.266]  And what is the extent of Russian influence in the U.S.
[03:37:46.266 --> 03:37:46.546]  today?
[03:37:47.792 --> 03:37:52.934]  I don't know what is the extent of Russian influence today in this country because I don't know.
[03:37:52.934 --> 03:37:57.875]  I'm not just dwelling the life of a public person.
[03:37:57.875 --> 03:38:01.776]  I'm not visiting press conferences and so on.
[03:38:01.776 --> 03:38:07.158]  But of course, traditionally, there always has been some influence.
[03:38:08.152 --> 03:38:10.233]  What about Russian Orthodox Church?
[03:38:10.233 --> 03:38:14.795]  Now Russia is the country which is emphasizing Christianity.
[03:38:14.795 --> 03:38:22.319]  It's very characteristic for Russian mind too.
[03:38:22.319 --> 03:38:22.820]  It's Christian.
[03:38:22.820 --> 03:38:29.683]  For example, I may give you a very interesting episode regarding this combination.
[03:38:29.683 --> 03:38:34.585]  KGB, maybe practice, KGB mind and Russian Orthodox values.
[03:38:36.388 --> 03:38:42.739]  KGB school over 40 years ago, we were asked the following question.
[03:38:42.739 --> 03:38:46.646]  What will you do if your father turns out to be a foreign spy?
[03:38:47.455 --> 03:38:53.419]  And I said, I will try to stop somehow his spying, but I will never betray my father.
[03:38:53.419 --> 03:39:14.393]  I will never report to the authorities about his espionage, because parents are more important than law, more important than state, because law can be mistaken, laws are taken by maybe sinful and mortal people who can be bribed, deceived and so on, but parents are given to you by Lord.
[03:39:15.674 --> 03:39:34.043]  Okay, let's play, I want you to get your comment on the video of Obama talking to Medvedev.
[03:39:34.043 --> 03:39:37.785]  Let's play that for about 30 seconds.
[03:39:37.785 --> 03:39:42.507]  This is Obama telling Medvedev that he'll be more flexible after the election.
[03:39:42.507 --> 03:39:43.548]  I want to know what's going on here.
[03:39:45.081 --> 03:39:51.685]  Okay, let's cut the video.
[03:39:51.685 --> 03:39:57.668]  That's good.
[03:40:13.263 --> 03:40:18.070]  Constantine, first of all, what was going on here with Obama talking to Medvedev?
[03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:21.594]  Obama is a pro-Russian voice in American government.
[03:40:21.594 --> 03:40:24.658]  Were there pro-Russian voices and are there in the Kremlin?
[03:40:24.658 --> 03:40:26.381]  And what is Obama up to here with Medvedev?
[03:40:28.182 --> 03:40:43.170]  I think as a former consultant advisor in intelligence mostly on China, but also as a speech writer to the head of our scientific and technical intelligence, this short talk is not enough to make any conclusion.
[03:40:44.370 --> 03:40:54.596]  As far as I know, the situation in these high spheres is changing so quickly, so drastically, that one episode mostly doesn't mean anything.
[03:40:54.596 --> 03:40:56.937]  We don't know the surrounding circumstances.
[03:40:56.937 --> 03:41:08.623]  It's too few information, just a piece of sand, a drop of sand of information, which is not enough to make any conclusions.
[03:41:08.623 --> 03:41:11.024]  Well, do you have pro... are there pro-American
[03:41:12.205 --> 03:41:17.609]  Pro-American voices in the Kremlin today like we have with Obama that was pro-Russia when he was in office.
[03:41:17.609 --> 03:41:20.612]  Are there pro-American supporters?
[03:41:20.612 --> 03:41:27.617]  I don't know, of course, but I think that in today's Kremlin there are no such people.
[03:41:27.617 --> 03:41:30.539]  And yes, there were, but now there are not.
[03:41:30.539 --> 03:41:32.981]  It's politics of today's Russia.
[03:41:32.981 --> 03:41:41.208]  As far as I know, but because I have no special information and no direct facts, I have been separated from all that kind of reality.
[03:41:42.327 --> 03:41:43.889]  Okay.
[03:41:43.889 --> 03:41:51.899]  What do you see in today's Democrat Party in America where they're going more and more toward socialist and communist point of view?
[03:41:51.899 --> 03:41:55.363]  What are they missing in terms of understanding the reality of socialism?
[03:41:57.008 --> 03:41:59.008]  Oh, I don't know it either.
[03:41:59.008 --> 03:42:01.209]  I've been just separated.
[03:42:01.209 --> 03:42:10.330]  Socialism, just, I have a feeling that socialism is now reviving the whole world, but I don't know enough facts about it.
[03:42:10.330 --> 03:42:17.672]  This problem should be studied, but as a historian, my first profession is history.
[03:42:17.672 --> 03:42:21.332]  I am specialist in Japanese history and language, but in the world history too.
[03:42:21.332 --> 03:42:24.573]  As a historian, I feel that socialism is coming back.
[03:42:25.243 --> 03:42:29.247]  The age of democracy is finishing.
[03:42:29.247 --> 03:42:33.610]  Many people think so too, but I have no facts to prove it.
[03:42:33.610 --> 03:42:40.416]  So let us see... Okay, well look, we'll be right back with some more.
[03:42:40.416 --> 03:42:44.180]  If you've got any questions for Constantine, it's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:42:44.180 --> 03:42:48.123]  We'll be right back with one more segment with Constantine.
[03:42:48.123 --> 03:42:49.825]  Back with you in a few minutes.
[03:42:53.123 --> 03:42:55.104]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:42:55.104 --> 03:42:55.824]  Go ahead.
[03:42:55.824 --> 03:42:58.045]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:42:58.045 --> 03:43:01.907]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:43:01.907 --> 03:43:03.328]  It just gets old, man.
[03:43:03.328 --> 03:43:05.749]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:43:05.749 --> 03:43:08.070]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:12.093]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:43:12.093 --> 03:43:14.514]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:43:15.374 --> 03:43:17.695]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:43:17.695 --> 03:43:19.416]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[03:43:19.416 --> 03:43:20.536]  Us being shut down?
[03:43:20.536 --> 03:43:22.017]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:43:22.017 --> 03:43:23.077]  You know what, Alex?
[03:43:23.077 --> 03:43:24.178]  Put him on pause again.
[03:43:24.178 --> 03:43:25.298]  Hey, Frank!
[03:43:25.298 --> 03:43:30.940]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:43:30.940 --> 03:43:35.482]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:43:35.482 --> 03:43:38.343]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:43:38.343 --> 03:43:39.064]  Do you understand?
[03:43:39.064 --> 03:43:40.704]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:43:40.704 --> 03:43:41.825]  I need your help, Frank!

[03:45:53.682 --> 03:46:01.304]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:46:01.304 --> 03:46:09.226]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:46:09.226 --> 03:46:12.307]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:46:12.967 --> 03:46:17.590]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:21.732]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:46:21.732 --> 03:46:24.874]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[03:46:24.874 --> 03:46:29.636]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:46:29.636 --> 03:46:32.678]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.

[03:47:07.559 --> 03:47:09.620]  I've been everywhere, man.
[03:47:09.620 --> 03:47:11.461]  Crossed the deserts bare, man.
[03:47:11.461 --> 03:47:13.562]  I've breathed the mountain air, man.
[03:47:13.562 --> 03:47:16.084]  Traveled like I had my share, man.
[03:47:16.084 --> 03:47:18.005]  I've been everywhere.
[03:47:18.005 --> 03:47:20.547]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:47:20.547 --> 03:47:25.310]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:47:25.310 --> 03:47:30.914]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.914 --> 03:47:31.534]  I'm a killer.
[03:47:31.534 --> 03:47:32.615]  I've been everywhere, man.
[03:47:36.608 --> 03:47:38.370]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.370 --> 03:47:39.691]  This is InfoWars.
[03:47:39.691 --> 03:47:42.713]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you again right from the left coast.
[03:47:42.713 --> 03:47:49.458]  Don't forget to get my new DVD, Trump the Art of the Insult, in the Alex Jones InfoWars store.
[03:47:49.458 --> 03:47:54.823]  We're still talking with former KGB Lieutenant Colonel Konstantin Prebajinsky.
[03:47:54.823 --> 03:47:59.386]  Konstantin, what can you tell us about the way of thinking of Vladimir Putin?
[03:47:59.386 --> 03:48:03.870]  What are his values and how does he approach statecraft?
[03:48:05.895 --> 03:48:23.275]  Well, I don't know, but as he's just of the same age with me, he's only one year older, and we have passed almost the same part of our biography, I think maybe I could understand him.
[03:48:24.055 --> 03:48:28.318]  Well, just why Russian people are supporting him?
[03:48:28.318 --> 03:48:37.563]  Because he's devoting himself to the national interest of Russia, which most of the Soviet leaders did not do.
[03:48:37.563 --> 03:48:42.986]  For example, Lenin was devoted to the world communism.
[03:48:42.986 --> 03:48:46.148]  Stalin, yes, he just was in the
[03:48:48.799 --> 03:48:53.262]  Very patriotic and nationalistic, though he was a very cruel person.
[03:48:53.262 --> 03:49:03.690]  But still, Russian people respect him because he has done something for the Soviet Union in order to make this country very strong.
[03:49:03.690 --> 03:49:05.912]  And what about other leaders?
[03:49:05.912 --> 03:49:08.834]  Khrushchev, he was just a weak leader.
[03:49:08.834 --> 03:49:12.357]  He was also thinking about communism, but not about his country.
[03:49:12.357 --> 03:49:15.900]  The same about Brezhnev, the same about Gorbachev.
[03:49:16.881 --> 03:49:22.585]  Yeltsin was a very weak leader and he was doing nothing for his country.
[03:49:22.585 --> 03:49:26.128]  That's why I think Russian people are supporting Putin.
[03:49:26.128 --> 03:49:31.953]  Is Putin someone who supports traditional values?
[03:49:31.953 --> 03:49:35.615]  Yes, of course.
[03:49:35.615 --> 03:49:42.101]  As far as I know, as far as I read, he has proclaimed the preservation of traditional family values.
[03:49:47.446 --> 03:49:55.584]  What is it about the Russian mentality, the Russian political worldview that you think Americans and the American government don't understand?
[03:49:56.959 --> 03:50:07.386]  Oh, just America and Russia, fortunately in the nation's psychology, very far from each other.
[03:50:07.386 --> 03:50:14.430]  Because Russia as a state, Russia as a country was formed by Russian Orthodox Church.
[03:50:14.430 --> 03:50:21.854]  If there was no baptism of Russia in Kiev by Prince Vladimir, there would be no Russia.
[03:50:25.056 --> 03:50:25.357]  I think?
[03:50:45.111 --> 03:50:51.354]  If you have a lot of money, people think, say that, oh, I think, says that God loves him.
[03:50:51.354 --> 03:50:57.596]  In Russia, in the same situation, we say, oh, it's devil tempting him.
[03:50:57.596 --> 03:51:03.358]  Maybe this money gained not in quite just way.
[03:51:03.358 --> 03:51:08.701]  So, so-called values are very much different.
[03:51:08.701 --> 03:51:09.421]  And one more thing.
[03:51:09.421 --> 03:51:10.982]  Russia has
[03:51:13.107 --> 03:51:22.837]  suffered foreign occupation, has suffered wars in its own territory for very many times for hundreds of years.
[03:51:22.837 --> 03:51:26.641]  America has never suffered enemy in its own territory.
[03:51:26.641 --> 03:51:35.090]  It makes some, it brings some nuances of difference, some different nuances in understanding war by Russians and Americans.
[03:51:36.576 --> 03:51:39.599]  Okay, I want to ask you about Russia's alliance with Iran.
[03:51:39.599 --> 03:51:47.745]  Let's take a quick look at an excerpt from The Art of the Insult, Donald Trump talking about the Iran deal during the campaign.
[03:51:47.745 --> 03:51:48.506]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:51:48.506 --> 03:51:53.750]  We're making a deal with Iran, and we're fighting Iran in Yemen.
[03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:56.553]  When you make the deal, aren't you supposed to sort of solve everything?
[03:51:56.553 --> 03:51:59.635]  I mean, here's a guy goes on a bicycle to go on a bicycle race.
[03:51:59.635 --> 03:52:01.016]  He's 73 years old.
[03:52:01.016 --> 03:52:01.717]  He's in a bicycle.
[03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:03.420]  Okay.
[03:52:30.672 --> 03:52:35.895]  Constantine, what is the traditional relationship between Russia and Iran?
[03:52:35.895 --> 03:52:43.520]  They've helped them build nuclear plants in Iran and they support them in the Middle East.
[03:52:43.520 --> 03:52:47.542]  What is the connection from the time that you were in the KGB till today?
[03:52:50.217 --> 03:53:02.706]  Speaking more generally, Russia and Iran simply have maintained very long relations for a very long period of history.
[03:53:02.706 --> 03:53:07.809]  Maybe for a thousand years while Russia is existing.
[03:53:07.809 --> 03:53:15.615]  If you go to the Moscow Kremlin, to its armory chamber, the Museum of Ancient Weapons and
[03:53:19.343 --> 03:53:29.171]  You will see the presence by Iranian Shahs, Iranian Kings to Russians, one dating back to maybe 11th, 12th, 14th century.
[03:53:29.171 --> 03:53:35.776]  So the history of Russian and Persian-Iranian relations is very long.
[03:53:35.776 --> 03:53:37.658]  It was not so friendly, of course.
[03:53:38.218 --> 03:53:39.499]  But what about today?
[03:53:39.499 --> 03:53:53.545]  I don't know about this Iranian involvement in atomic weapons, because I'm not informed about that.
[03:53:53.545 --> 03:54:00.388]  But still, the very fact that Russia and Iran are very, very long partners, long-time partners, it tells, of course.
[03:54:00.388 --> 03:54:03.389]  It brings some influence into their relations today.
[03:54:04.858 --> 03:54:13.626]  Okay, and finally, let's talk about the Mueller probe investigating Donald Trump based on this Russian-influenced dossier.
[03:54:13.626 --> 03:54:19.011]  How do you think the Kremlin, Putin feel about this investigation?
[03:54:19.011 --> 03:54:24.095]  Are they upset that they're the subject of investigation for interfering in elections?
[03:54:24.095 --> 03:54:26.657]  Or are they laughing every day when they see
[03:54:27.927 --> 03:54:35.194]  The American government under such siege, based on this whole theory of Russians getting involved with the Trump campaign.
[03:54:35.194 --> 03:54:38.737]  How are they looking at this from their point of view, do you think?
[03:54:38.737 --> 03:54:40.198]  Of course, I can only guess.
[03:54:40.198 --> 03:54:41.539]  Can only guess, of course.
[03:54:41.539 --> 03:54:43.961]  Because I don't know anything.
[03:54:43.961 --> 03:54:46.163]  But maybe they laugh, too.
[03:54:46.163 --> 03:54:50.067]  Because it is normal work of intelligence.
[03:54:53.067 --> 03:54:57.810]  I think their reaction may be very different kinds.
[03:54:57.810 --> 03:55:08.798]  But still, one can say that some reaction, some reflection of this reality in Kremlin is very serious.
[03:55:08.798 --> 03:55:17.484]  Today, Kremlin and Russia in general has got very skilled specialists in many countries.
[03:55:17.484 --> 03:55:18.585]  I feel it.
[03:55:18.585 --> 03:55:20.126]  The Soviet Union was not so.
[03:55:20.706 --> 03:55:28.934]  So today's specials in America, in Japan and China, the Russian ones, are better than they were in the Soviet period.
[03:55:28.934 --> 03:55:32.858]  Okay.
[03:55:32.858 --> 03:55:37.182]  Let's take one call from Dr. Kelly in Northern California.
[03:55:37.182 --> 03:55:38.543]  He has one question for Constantine.
[03:55:38.543 --> 03:55:39.985]  Go ahead, Dr. Kelly.
[03:55:40.632 --> 03:55:44.576]  Hey, thank you so much for taking my call and for all of your work.
[03:55:44.576 --> 03:56:04.475]  I discovered a copy of the King James Bible translated into Russian and during times of high tension over the last three or four years, I would pray and fast and put this on and listen to it and hope that if anyone else was listening that they could hear it too.
[03:56:05.436 --> 03:56:12.099]  And I really appreciate the efforts of our countries to befriend each other.
[03:56:12.099 --> 03:56:14.541]  You know, we're brothers.
[03:56:14.541 --> 03:56:18.543]  And that we are one nation under God, indivisible.
[03:56:18.543 --> 03:56:19.443]  Okay, thank you.
[03:56:19.443 --> 03:56:20.464]  Thank you for the call.
[03:56:20.464 --> 03:56:29.368]  Constantine, is Russia becoming more religious and going back more toward traditional values while America is becoming less traditional and more socialist?
[03:56:30.736 --> 03:56:45.685]  Yes, Russia, I don't know about America because I'm not so much deep in Israel, but Russia really is returning to Christianity, which is a great contradiction with Europe, with the West in general.
[03:56:45.685 --> 03:56:58.453]  So I think it determines the way of thinking of Russians, and I can feel it reading Russian media, the Christian approach to the world.
[03:56:58.453 --> 03:56:59.534]  Yes, it is
[03:57:00.723 --> 03:57:07.064]  Really, something vital, something important for Russians today.
[03:57:07.064 --> 03:57:20.447]  It's almost as if all the work during the Cold War, where the KGB was trying to infiltrate and influence the left in America to cause America to be more socialist, worked.
[03:57:20.447 --> 03:57:26.689]  And America's influence during the Cold War to cause Russia to be more traditional, that also worked.
[03:57:26.689 --> 03:57:27.649]  So we're switching roles.
[03:57:27.649 --> 03:57:28.469]  It's very fascinating.
[03:57:29.282 --> 03:57:30.963]  Uh, good man.
[03:57:30.963 --> 03:57:33.025]  Thank you so much for being with us for all the insight.
