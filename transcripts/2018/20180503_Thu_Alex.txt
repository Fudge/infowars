[00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.082]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.843]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:49.771]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, already the third day of May 2018, worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.893]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.476]  And look at the headlines I have here in front of me.
[00:00:57.817 --> 00:00:58.557]  Aren't they interesting?
[00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:00.018]  Wired Magazine.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.601]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:08.284]  Big Wireless doesn't want you to know.
[00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:12.623]  Now think about that.
[00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:19.025]  Because I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news and on the so-called comedy shows.
[00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.466]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:28.708]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:32.909]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.570]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.231]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:39.731]  It is.
[00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.610]  On and on and on.
[00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.791]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:01:46.632 --> 00:02:08.238]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and in how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves,
[00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:15.953]  Cell phones operate as microwave transmitters and receivers.
[00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:17.794]  Transceivers.
[00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:20.676]  Now what's a microwave do?
[00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:21.696]  It vibrates water.
[00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.577]  Vibrates molecules.
[00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:30.480]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:37.289]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:38.810]  We're going to cover those studies.
[00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.650]  You heard me right.
[00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.491]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:49.134]  5G destroys ozone.
[00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:53.656]  So they're telling us we're going to destroy ozone, but not telling us what really does it.
[00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:55.796]  And then doing it.
[00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.498]  That doesn't sound like something humans would do.
[00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.751]  Why are the globalists doing this?
[00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.812]  Why are they changing the atmosphere?
[00:03:05.192 --> 00:03:05.912]  Who are they?
[00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:14.056]  Now ladies and gentlemen, the question is how do we get people out of their trance?
[00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:19.519]  How are we going to do that?
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.823]  We're going to talk about that today in the second hour and lay out mainline studies, mainline science,
[00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:48.514]  That 5G and even the lower 4 and 3G, your game boxes, a lot of your appliances, the smart meters, surveil and dial into everything digital in your house and steal your data.
[00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:50.256]  They physically listen to you audibly.
[00:03:51.249 --> 00:04:01.355]  And they watch you, not with the conventional iris and a camera visually, but with the millimeter waves, the same way a naked body scanner reads you at the airport.
[00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:04.578]  It shoots out and reads everything in your house.
[00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:12.803]  But you invite the little Alexas in, you invite the little Google assistants in, there's a big race, you know, the security companies.
[00:04:13.323 --> 00:04:16.065]  Oh, it sits there, it listens to you, it watches, it cares.
[00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.659]  And a lot of them kick on when there's burglaries or the sounds of people being upset.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.640]  Or they call the police for you.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.102]  There's certainly a good side to the double edge.
[00:04:29.443 --> 00:04:31.204]  But it was designed as a Trojan horse.
[00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.875]  We're going to cover it all today.
[00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:42.261]  And black helicopters terrified the public in a major city of New Jersey with explosions and machine gun fire on purpose.
[00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.183]  We'll explain the story behind the story and have the powerful video coming up.
[00:04:45.803 --> 00:04:52.368]  And then we have so much more we're going to be looking at here today that is absolutely critical.
[00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:54.870]  The latest on Kanye West and so much more.
[00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.911]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:10.647]  I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration.
[00:05:10.988 --> 00:05:15.991]  Texas and six other states are suing the Trump administration over its failure to end DACA.
[00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:30.320]  Adon Salazar reports that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the multi-state lawsuit, which was filed in federal court Tuesday, and seeks to put an end to the unconstitutional immigration program, which protects many illegals from deportation.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.184]  Paxton said the multi-state coalition lawsuit is about the rule of law, not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy.
[00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:44.206]  The suit faults activist judges for preventing the Trump administration from phasing out DACA as promised.
[00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:54.891]  According to Paxton, this means that unelected federal judges are forcing the Trump administration to leave an unlawful program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on.
[00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.113]  Adding, President Trump has a duty under the Constitution
[00:05:58.473 --> 00:06:11.956]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:30.702]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, the third day of May 2018.
[00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:32.623]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:35.225]  We've got a lot of really informative, powerful guests joining us.
[00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:43.332]  James O'Keefe has another big bombshell inside the bizarre state-run education programs in this country.
[00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:50.818]  Shocking information looking at organized cover-up of abusive students at the highest levels.
[00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:53.661]  So we're going to be looking at that shocking video and talking to James O'Keefe.
[00:06:54.321 --> 00:07:04.585]  We're going to have Dr. Group in studio to break down the mainline medical science that 5G and even below is massively increasing cancer.
[00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:10.587]  And it's currently, it's estimated, and mainline science will go over, killing more people than cigarettes.
[00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:12.648]  You heard me right.
[00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:14.629]  And they're only upping the power.
[00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.470]  And we'll go into why they want this system.
[00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.652]  Now it's being used as a system to kill fertility.
[00:07:22.534 --> 00:07:31.677]  That Oprah Winfrey, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, and others, Warren Buffett, meet each year to discuss a planetary world government plan to covertly reduce world population.
[00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.399]  Six years ago, they went ahead and admitted they do meet with that plan.
[00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.479]  In fact, you can just type that in.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.602]  Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, and others meet to discuss world depopulation.
[00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:48.344]  You might want to read it, because it's going on right now, and the 5G, and the Atrazine, and all of it.
[00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:51.185]  Now, I've always noticed, what is it they don't want me to talk about?
[00:07:52.878 --> 00:08:00.444]  They don't want me to ever talk about Islam taking over.
[00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:04.828]  They don't want me to talk about atrazine and chemicals reducing fertility.
[00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:14.296]  And they don't want me talking about cell phone radiation causing cancer, but also causing heart problems, mental illness, you name it, in all the major studies.
[00:08:15.737 --> 00:08:20.701]  And now they're going to mount well beyond 5G, high-powered microwave transmitters
[00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:26.020]  On the bottoms of, quote, all major commercial aircraft.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.221]  You see the TV ads on Fox running for this.
[00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:34.323]  So, quote, you'll have Wi-Fi all over the country, even in rural areas.
[00:08:34.903 --> 00:08:37.425]  Even if you don't want it blasting down on you.
[00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:43.527]  And of course, the London Telegraph reports on mainline studies we'll be covering later.
[00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:49.950]  Mobile phone cancer warning as malignant brain tumors d-d-d-d-d-d-double.
[00:08:51.803 --> 00:08:52.243]  Double!
[00:08:54.864 --> 00:09:02.285]  Oh, it's your fun phone, you play with your friends, you put up your head, you hold it there, and you are cooking your brain.
[00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.166]  Total fact.
[00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:13.968]  But you know, it's funny that the scientists even admit this is happening because what do they make fun of me on?
[00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:20.609]  On Colbert and the HBO shows and the Showtime shows, the Homeland shows.
[00:09:21.786 --> 00:09:35.194]  And it was even in the news last week, they said Homeland and all the other big media outlets, Netflix, all of them go, they rotate out a week each of the year, and they meet at Laney, Virginia, at the CIA, and they learn what they're supposed to say.
[00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:49.643]  And they're supposed to say, Alex Jones is bad, cell phone radiation doesn't hurt you, vaccines never hurt you, there's no geoengineering going on, even though it's all declassified, admitted, and there's no world government, and everything's fine.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.862]  And the sperm counts aren't down 87% and depression isn't massively up in the youth, of course it all is.
[00:09:57.022 --> 00:09:58.422]  And there's, again, everything's fine.
[00:09:58.462 --> 00:09:59.942]  And oh, and also, remember the old one?
[00:10:00.963 --> 00:10:17.447]  I remember I was first on air 23 years ago, and it would be in Soldier of Fortune or it would be in a local newspaper that 14 black helicopters, as they were described, showed up and then attacked the old school that was scheduled for demolition the next month, setting it on fire.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.840]  Three people at the old folks' homes had heart attacks.
[00:10:24.641 --> 00:10:43.965]  And I would, I was decompartmentalizing news, I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, but I would take some local story from South Texas, or a story that somebody mailed me from Indiana, or people mail me VHS tapes, as I was on local radio, but used that to syndicate out on the satellite, and I was on, I don't know, like 15 radio stations, even by 1996 or so, and Global Shortwave.
[00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:45.265]  And satellite,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.002]  The K-Band people had on their houses then, a lot of them still do.
[00:10:49.022 --> 00:10:51.585]  It's not an audience, but people that cared, that were looking for the truth.
[00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:53.206]  And they were the ones that educated me.
[00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:58.330]  I was just a mainline libertarian, kind of conservative, knew a lot of history, but didn't get the big picture.
[00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.551]  They educated me real fast.
[00:11:01.493 --> 00:11:05.676]  And so, I would play on the radio clips of local news.
[00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:13.743]  About, you know, foreign troops with the army, and blowing up buildings, and no one was told.
[00:11:13.763 --> 00:11:14.424]  And I'd play it,
[00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:24.996]  And they would have the state police write an article for the Austin American Statesman saying Jones is insane, Jones is dangerous.
[00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:27.499]  None of this exists.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.602]  And they put it on the front page of the paper.
[00:11:32.403 --> 00:11:34.645]  And I would have the San Antonio police chief on.
[00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:36.346]  I'd have the Austin police.
[00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:37.087]  I'd talk to them.
[00:11:37.107 --> 00:11:39.509]  I'd have the emergency manager at Kingsville on.
[00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:46.014]  They would detail how it was the Delta Force and how they were there with Czech, Republican, German troops.
[00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:51.938]  And I wasn't even attacking the military, but they'd say, Jones is attacking our military and doesn't want you to trust him.
[00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:57.042]  And then they would do these pre-training deals where sometimes they would warn them.
[00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:58.704]  They'd knock on doors and say,
[00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:04.349]  Alex Jones hates America, and he may be coming to talk to you.
[00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:05.669]  When he comes, don't talk to him.
[00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:07.990]  This is in my films, Police State 1, Police State 2.
[00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.571]  And I had the locals going, yeah, the Army colonel came by yesterday and said, don't talk to you, you're an enemy.
[00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:15.351]  I don't think you're an enemy.
[00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:23.633]  And they came, and it was scary, and I know who you are, and I heard you a year ago say this, and then they came, and they was blowing it up over there.
[00:12:29.437 --> 00:12:31.398]  So it became this big challenge for me.
[00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:37.223]  Because the news nationally would say, there are no black helicopters.
[00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.463]  It's not happening.
[00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:39.884]  And I didn't even know what was going on.
[00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:50.292]  Now I know it was a psyop to train the public that if martial law ever came in, when they came in to take out the local government, if ordered by Bill Clinton who was preparing this, he was testing it.
[00:12:51.553 --> 00:12:55.474]  That they wanted the locals to lay down during the assault.
[00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.616]  And that's why every major town in the U.S.
[00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:06.259]  has had multiple Army, Air Force, Marines, you name it, invasions.
[00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:09.620]  Most of them unannounced.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.302]  It's so that when they decide to really hit you, you don't know what hit you.
[00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:18.163]  And again, the military is later how I learned about this.
[00:13:18.603 --> 00:13:20.664]  The San Antonio Police Chief was in Army Intelligence.
[00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.065]  I don't know.
[00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.520]  In Kingsville, and then later in Austin.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.642]  They went ahead and told the head of the SWAT team, and they fired the Travis County head.
[00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.323]  Once he told me, they said, look, we apologize.
[00:13:44.604 --> 00:13:52.649]  This is a PDD gun confiscation, martial law drill, in case state houses or any county stand up during a UN takeover.
[00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:53.990]  And we now know that's all real.
[00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.192]  Loretta Lynch wanted it, the Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:01.255]  They wanted to cause a race war, then have the UN come in and put departments under the UN.
[00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:03.237]  That was in the local paper here.
[00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.782]  So I would cover all this.
[00:14:05.802 --> 00:14:12.025]  I had police chiefs and emergency managers telling me and the Delta Force had told them they didn't like it, that Bill Clinton was telling them.
[00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:13.726]  And man, they got pissed.
[00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:18.428]  I mean, they had the guys come and physically attack me, all sorts of stuff I'm not going to get into on air.
[00:14:18.448 --> 00:14:22.090]  But the point is that I got the message, you better shut up.
[00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.291]  But that was from Clinton goons, not the military.
[00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:30.434]  Now, what just hit last night?
[00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.672]  This is CBSLocal.com, New York.
[00:14:35.512 --> 00:14:39.875]  Department of Defense training exercise terrifies unprepared New Jersey residents.
[00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:45.678]  It all started off as well-kept secret, but the explosions and helicopters ended up giving it away.
[00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:46.719]  Members of the U.S.
[00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:52.142]  Department of Defense were conducting training recently in a New Jersey neighborhood, and the result was plenty of residents with frayed nerves.
[00:14:52.762 --> 00:14:54.864]  Dick Brennan reported for CBS.
[00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:56.439]  Channel 2.
[00:14:56.679 --> 00:15:00.921]  Other cities sued the Fish Department over gunship reporting.
[00:15:01.241 --> 00:15:03.641]  Cell phone video captured the moment.
[00:15:03.662 --> 00:15:04.682]  We'll roll some of that, guys.
[00:15:05.462 --> 00:15:06.642]  A helicopter flew above.
[00:15:06.963 --> 00:15:13.565]  There was excitement in the photographer's voice, but that's because the video was taken on the second night of action.
[00:15:14.025 --> 00:15:15.145]  They didn't warn him the first night.
[00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:17.746]  Residents say they've never seen anything like it before.
[00:15:17.806 --> 00:15:18.386]  Now here's the deal.
[00:15:19.207 --> 00:15:23.448]  Now they admit this, and it's being done now for different reasons, but
[00:15:24.684 --> 00:15:25.846]  It's anti-terrorism training.
[00:15:26.107 --> 00:15:28.111]  But the overall mission was to acclimate us.
[00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:30.896]  And so, it was huge under Clinton.
[00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:32.760]  Some happened under Bush.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.942]  Came back under Obama.
[00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:34.984]  It's still continuing.
[00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:39.863]  And I'll get into what's behind it, but remember, remember that didn't exist.
[00:15:39.923 --> 00:15:40.924]  Remember you were insane.
[00:15:41.124 --> 00:15:49.569]  Remember the black helicopter people, and oh they're crazy, and oh they say they saw... You'd be out in the middle of Alabama and there'd be a Marine Corps checkpoint searching people.
[00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.750]  And we'd get the video and they'd go, Jones is crazy!
[00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.531]  There were no Marines searching vehicles here.
[00:15:55.052 --> 00:15:57.433]  And so this is all part of the acclamation.
[00:15:58.153 --> 00:16:00.895]  And again, another thing where you get decades of news before.

[00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.811]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:08.652]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.

[00:20:24.554 --> 00:20:25.195]  Big Brother.
[00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:26.915]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:28.595]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.816]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:31.076 --> 00:20:32.176]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:32.716 --> 00:20:37.477]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:44.138]  Well, everyone in 2018 knows that your town, your city, has had unannounced
[00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:49.387]  8 to 14 to 20 plus black helicopters.
[00:20:49.407 --> 00:20:53.969]  They're painted black with paint that helps absorb radar waves.
[00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.491]  Not your classic deep army green.
[00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:10.418]  You've all experienced the night stalkers out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky deliver army personnel for training to operate in the United States.
[00:21:11.178 --> 00:21:12.118]  It's to acclimate them.
[00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:13.019]  It's to acclimate you.
[00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:22.884]  But just remember in the early 1990s when the activity was, I've got to say, hundreds of times what it is now.
[00:21:22.964 --> 00:21:28.406]  I mean, it was black helicopters hitting towns every couple days.
[00:21:28.466 --> 00:21:32.467]  It was a major, massive operation under Bill Clinton that started about 94.
[00:21:32.507 --> 00:21:42.190]  And it was to train everybody to accept Waco-type attacks.
[00:21:43.257 --> 00:21:46.900]  On churches, on city halls, on state houses.
[00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:49.422]  It was usually too obvious to hit a Capitol.
[00:21:50.663 --> 00:21:52.044]  So they would hit courthouses.
[00:21:54.086 --> 00:22:06.235]  And you've seen federal judges and state judges, even in Texas, come out and say, under Obama, remember a few years ago, they said if gun confiscation begins and they bring in UN troops, we're going to have to get armored personnel carriers for the Sheriff's Department to fight it.
[00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:12.120]  People thought, man, that's crazy, but the national media barely picked it up when state judges and others
[00:22:13.777 --> 00:22:17.861]  Said that because they'd been briefed via FEMA on the plan.
[00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:19.762]  That was what, four years ago?
[00:22:19.802 --> 00:22:21.144]  They had a couple big judges come out.
[00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:26.869]  And then a year later, Loretta Lynch goes, we're gonna have the UN run local departments if there's a race war.
[00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.831]  And now we have the documents, they were trying to start one.
[00:22:31.693 --> 00:22:35.076]  I mean, I used to hear this from our military sources and I thought they were messing with us.
[00:22:35.836 --> 00:22:37.938]  I would say sources say 20 years ago.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.941]  Now the plan's public.
[00:22:43.012 --> 00:22:48.335]  You can see my films free online, Police State 1, Police State 2, Police State 3, Police State 4.
[00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:58.381]  They all have the black helicopters, the local police, the Marine Corps checkpoints.
[00:22:59.661 --> 00:23:02.303]  The Army took over the role of taking over local government.
[00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:06.243]  At hitting first.
[00:23:06.283 --> 00:23:08.945]  You'd think the Marines would hit first, but it was usually Army training to hit first.
[00:23:09.245 --> 00:23:12.948]  Marines would then come in and take control of the population and process people.
[00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:18.153]  I mean, it's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:23.257 --> 00:23:24.138]  We're Americans!
[00:23:24.178 --> 00:23:25.018]  We deserve you!
[00:23:25.199 --> 00:23:25.699]  Help us!
[00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:26.159]  No!
[00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:27.080]  Don't take our guns!
[00:23:27.621 --> 00:23:28.341]  Go see the video!
[00:23:30.803 --> 00:23:33.786]  And the national news, when this came out, CNN played clips.
[00:23:34.986 --> 00:23:39.630]  In the mid-90s and said, Alex Jones is a liar, he hired fake marines.
[00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:43.273]  They said, the footage you're watching of your TV viewer is fake.
[00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:45.095]  Hovercraft landing.
[00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:47.597]  The Coronado amphibious ship landing.
[00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:49.899]  They claimed, I faked it.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.402]  Now that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:23:55.083 --> 00:24:02.470]  The atrazine isn't sterilizing you and turning mammals, amphibians, into asexual, hermaphrodites,
[00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:04.859]  Yes, it's all admitted.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.320]  Thousands of studies.
[00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:10.002]  5G, totally giving you massive cancer.
[00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:11.743]  Brain tumors already doubled the last decade.
[00:24:13.523 --> 00:24:16.185]  Journal of Medicine, just showed you the article earlier.
[00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:21.547]  Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
[00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:22.648]  Boom.
[00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:24.689]  Berkeley, science department.
[00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:29.691]  UC Berkeley, Tyrone Hayes, professor of integrative biology.
[00:24:31.088 --> 00:24:31.969]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:42.339]  Looking down his nose, Ben Shapiro, the unmade man, none of these so-called fake conservatives can ever launch a company.
[00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:46.603]  They've always got billionaires financing them, which isn't a bad thing, but we're the only outfit self-made.
[00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:49.346]  No one else in media except Matt Drudge is self-made.
[00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:50.287]  No one.
[00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:52.129]  Matt Drudge and Infowars at this level.
[00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.609]  No one else.
[00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:54.952]  Matt Drudge and Infowars.
[00:24:55.092 --> 00:24:55.332]  That's it.
[00:25:00.387 --> 00:25:01.087]  Now think about that.
[00:25:02.508 --> 00:25:04.249]  They say Ben Shapiro's buying the blaze.
[00:25:04.309 --> 00:25:09.472]  No, Texas billionaires that he's carpet-bagged down here to get are trying to do it.
[00:25:09.492 --> 00:25:16.256]  I think I'm going to call those billionaires and warn those guys, because I know years ago I've had a lot of people contact me and never got back, because I'm funding my own operation here.
[00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.156]  That's my mission.
[00:25:17.796 --> 00:25:25.300]  But if Shapiro really wants to get in my business down here in Texas, try to move down here, we already exposed Beck as a fake.
[00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:27.362]  He's out of business.
[00:25:28.522 --> 00:25:29.443]  He's pretty much closed shop.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.184]  And you go read Shapiro's website, almost every comment can't stand him and hates him.
[00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:39.629]  Because it's this whole act of how he's intellectual, and he's this genius, and he's this wizard, and he knows everything.
[00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:42.131]  And then almost every comment, I'm gonna show you later, hate his guts.
[00:25:44.193 --> 00:25:47.957]  And say, oh, you're so intellectual, you use terms like Alex is awful.
[00:25:51.138 --> 00:25:52.058]  And of course, won't debate me.
[00:25:52.358 --> 00:25:53.179]  And why am I mad?
[00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:57.240]  Because Glenn Beck got in my business with radio stations and would keep me off air.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.922]  I talked to many station owners and managers where they would threaten to not be on their station and do all the stuff if I wasn't taking off.
[00:26:03.623 --> 00:26:06.584]  And now you're in my business again, trying to tell people not to come on my show.
[00:26:07.144 --> 00:26:10.405]  I'm about to get in your business big time, you little arrogant son of a bitch.
[00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:17.788]  Now go back to California, go back to Los Angeles, where you came from.
[00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:27.414]  Wait till I go talk to those billionaires that are good Christian men, Seventh-day Adventist pastors, and lay out how you and Jordan Peterson, you think I'm stupid because I'm from Texas?
[00:26:28.495 --> 00:26:31.057]  Wait till I go explain to those self-made men that you aren't.
[00:26:32.198 --> 00:26:38.802]  As a self-made Texan myself, how you and others in the atheist movement are taking control of the whole conservative movement.
[00:26:39.994 --> 00:26:43.395]  And that's why the left puts Peterson and all you guys on TV and doesn't censor you.
[00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:47.837]  With the whole atheist bent and the whole Christ isn't God thing.
[00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:48.637]  All of that.
[00:26:48.677 --> 00:26:53.419]  How did you convince Texas Christians to sit there and prop up Glenn Beck and now you?
[00:26:54.459 --> 00:26:56.160]  You don't think I don't know everything about you, bro?
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.581]  And now you're trying to sucker them to buy the failed garbage blaze?
[00:27:04.442 --> 00:27:06.643]  You can't make anything, you parasite.
[00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:08.824]  Get behind me, Satan.
[00:27:10.247 --> 00:27:12.008]  We should pray for Ben Shapiro to find Christ.
[00:27:14.289 --> 00:27:22.473]  His whole act of how smart he is, as he just sits there, reads off a teleprompter and plagiarizes people, in my view.
[00:27:23.493 --> 00:27:25.674]  So, you're in my business, Shapiro.
[00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:27.335]  I'm in your business now.
[00:27:28.675 --> 00:27:38.300]  I might just drive up to Cisco this weekend, take a few army officers with me, and have a conversation with the billionaires that are financing you.
[00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:40.830]  Maybe show him some files, Shapiro.
[00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.070]  Want that?
[00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:43.771]  Think you do?
[00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:44.871]  I think I'll do it.
[00:27:45.452 --> 00:27:46.832]  I think I'll get in your business.
[00:27:47.092 --> 00:27:49.333]  You know what happens when I get in people's businesses, boy?
[00:27:51.214 --> 00:27:52.915]  They ain't in business long, son.
[00:27:54.176 --> 00:27:55.796]  You like what I did to your daddy, Beck?
[00:27:56.437 --> 00:27:57.677]  He really did it to himself, didn't he?
[00:27:58.077 --> 00:27:59.398]  But we told everybody what he was.
[00:28:02.878 --> 00:28:04.940]  So you want to be in a man's world, son?
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.823]  I took on Hillary Clinton with my audience and we kicked her butt.
[00:28:09.244 --> 00:28:10.445]  She's coming at me right now.
[00:28:10.825 --> 00:28:12.146]  I'm in a man's world, son.
[00:28:12.186 --> 00:28:12.987]  I'm self-made.
[00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:16.690]  You couldn't do a damn thing.
[00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:17.911]  You couldn't come up with a dollar.
[00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:21.054]  Everything he's ever had was finance, just like Beck.
[00:28:22.392 --> 00:28:27.597]  I was offered Beck's job when they had him in the stable getting him trained 16, 17 years ago.
[00:28:28.197 --> 00:28:33.762]  And just like then, they sent him in to be a fake Mormon to suck off the Mormon church to launch his whole operation.
[00:28:34.743 --> 00:28:35.824]  And that's what Shapiro does.
[00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:43.011]  He comes down here with his whole little closeted atheist anti-Christian operation, and he sucks off some Christians he thinks are dumbasses.
[00:28:45.353 --> 00:28:46.054]  Well, son!
[00:28:47.516 --> 00:28:48.317]  You want a fight?
[00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:49.157]  You got one.
[00:28:49.197 --> 00:28:51.139]  I love how you talk to Kanye West like he's a dog.
[00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:52.439]  No, no, no!
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.720]  You don't go on that show.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.361]  No, no, no!
[00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:59.284]  Boy, you just filled your hand against the wrong group of people, son.
[00:28:59.664 --> 00:29:00.865]  Get your ass out of Texas.
[00:29:02.352 --> 00:29:02.692]  It's a no.
[00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:09.979]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.441]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:18.907]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:29:19.307 --> 00:29:21.950]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.252]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:29:25.612 --> 00:29:31.536]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:29:32.176 --> 00:29:38.700]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:44.903]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:48.966]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:29:49.466 --> 00:29:57.694]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:29:58.075 --> 00:30:04.321]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:05.356 --> 00:30:09.797]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:18.518]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:20.739]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:28.200]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.260]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[00:30:31.861 --> 00:30:32.741]  It's not absorbable.
[00:30:33.141 --> 00:30:33.681]  It's toxic.
[00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:46.512]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:30:46.632 --> 00:30:49.154]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:30:49.895 --> 00:30:58.277]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:02.437]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:31:02.837 --> 00:31:07.558]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:31:08.138 --> 00:31:11.699]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:15.860]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.182]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:20.343]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:31:20.763 --> 00:31:22.125]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:24.867]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:31:24.907 --> 00:31:28.129]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.952]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:31:32.413 --> 00:31:34.534]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:36.256]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:43.962]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:31:44.282 --> 00:31:45.143]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:45.743 --> 00:31:45.883]  Yeah.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.281]  I don't think so.
[00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:18.488]  That we can work this out.
[00:32:36.625 --> 00:32:39.426]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[00:32:39.747 --> 00:32:48.070]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:32:48.631 --> 00:32:52.953]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:32:53.373 --> 00:32:59.936]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:06.363 --> 00:33:08.987]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.557 --> 00:33:26.578]  You found it.
[00:33:26.598 --> 00:33:28.460]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.621]  It's the InfoWars.
[00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:34.703]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:42.428]  So, over the years I've had a lot of Texas oil people contact me and want to try to help InfoWars.
[00:33:43.008 --> 00:33:45.990]  And I've never done it because I want to self-fund their operation.
[00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:48.312]  And I have that as an ace in the hole.
[00:33:49.212 --> 00:33:51.734]  You know, a lot of people that I can go to if I needed a lot of money.
[00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:57.559]  That's why the whole Soros-Hillary plan, where they're in the news, on NBC News, saying they plan to shut me down.
[00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.280]  They admit the Democratic Party's behind it.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.944]  It's why we don't want to go down that route, but we're going to win one way or another.
[00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:10.770]  With our listeners supporting us, with us putting it all into the fight, expanding on the TV stations across the country, the broadcast is exploding.
[00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:16.696]  And I'm going to get into all the other big world news, but the reason I'm attacking Ben Shapiro is he wasn't ripe enough
[00:34:18.387 --> 00:34:22.650]  When I heard about him years ago from one of the top talk show hosts in the country.
[00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:26.233]  And just look out for this guy, he's as bad as it gets.
[00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:28.735]  I just heard from that national talk show host during the break.
[00:34:29.316 --> 00:34:30.817]  We're talking one of the top three names.
[00:34:32.838 --> 00:34:35.881]  And I was warned about him and I just ignore it because I try to be a team player.
[00:34:37.583 --> 00:35:01.397]  And then I noticed Shapiro behind the scenes causing us problems and then also reaching out to people in a whisper campaign saying don't be associated with Infowars just like CNN and MSNBC and George Soros and all them are doing and I just ignore it and move on because the guy just comes off so arrogant and then you know he has his own website that talks about what a genius he is all day and his own readers are just sick of it.
[00:35:03.338 --> 00:35:04.999]  You know another snot-nosed arrogant
[00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:07.633]  No at all.
[00:35:08.774 --> 00:35:19.159]  But, then I also realized that he was trying to get some really nice self-made Christian men who created their own oil company.
[00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:23.221]  And have become, you know, multi-billionaires individually.
[00:35:23.761 --> 00:35:25.542]  And one of the brothers owns the Daily Wire.
[00:35:25.562 --> 00:35:30.204]  And then Shapiro runs around and talks about, you know, how he's this big business titan.
[00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:33.126]  And Shapiro couldn't tie his own shoelaces.
[00:35:34.102 --> 00:35:37.665]  So, and I know about all this stuff because I live here in Texas, okay?
[00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:39.546]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:35:41.127 --> 00:35:43.209]  But my family's all over the state and they know a lot of people.
[00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:45.250]  And they're in a lot of different businesses.
[00:35:46.871 --> 00:35:56.218]  And so I start to see Shapiro openly saying that Candace Owens don't come on his show and Kanye West and trying to police me.
[00:35:57.836 --> 00:36:01.299]  And I realize it was ripe to go after him because here's why he's important.
[00:36:01.379 --> 00:36:02.500]  He's the next Glenn Beck.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.621]  He's the next Judas Goat.
[00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:06.743]  He's the next guy to control the Christian conservative movement.
[00:36:09.025 --> 00:36:12.788]  Just like Glenn Beck went and married a Mormon to get the Mormon money to have the Mormon cred.
[00:36:13.249 --> 00:36:20.715]  Two years before he married that lady, he was a shock jock praising abortion, calling up other talk show hosts saying, I heard your wife had a miscarriage, thank God.
[00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:22.917]  I mean, he was a horrible demon.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.541]  He worked in more than 20 markets.
[00:36:26.982 --> 00:36:29.144]  I know people that know Beck very well.
[00:36:29.224 --> 00:36:33.467]  He is... You give him the wrong pen, he screams and yells at you and fires you.
[00:36:33.908 --> 00:36:37.571]  He's just a monstrous, very neurotic person.
[00:36:39.232 --> 00:36:40.514]  And he believes he's like a messiah.
[00:36:42.695 --> 00:36:45.238]  He's also got a lot of foreign money and funding coming in.
[00:36:46.238 --> 00:36:47.700]  So, he bet on the wrong horse.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.681]  I like Ted Cruz.
[00:36:48.701 --> 00:36:49.882]  Ted Cruz has a good voting record.
[00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:56.292]  But the whole Texas Act and the cowboy boots and, you know, the holier-than-thou stuff, that's an act too.
[00:36:57.112 --> 00:36:58.113]  I'm not going to judge his heart.
[00:36:58.893 --> 00:37:00.715]  I'm a real Christian, but I don't tell you I'm perfect.
[00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:06.959]  I don't sit up here and tell you how good I pray on Sunday and put on the whole, mmm, good Christian act thing, okay?
[00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.801]  I'm ready to die for Christ, but I'm definitely a sinner.
[00:37:10.901 --> 00:37:17.666]  So these guys are waltzing into Texas again, just like Beck did, and they're waltzing in here to get all the Texas oil money to back them.
[00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:22.460]  And that gets passed through their companies, and then the companies fold.
[00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.783]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:37:26.943 --> 00:37:45.778]  And if you go back to Shapiro and where he comes from, and the people he worked for previously, and this particular national talk show host who just might decide to go public, or might decide to actually talk to Ferris Wilkes and his brother, who are good men, I know people that know him, talk about really upright, hard-working, self-made men.
[00:37:46.644 --> 00:37:50.746]  Off their masonry company their daddy started, and they didn't get into oil until like 15 years ago.
[00:37:50.946 --> 00:37:52.787]  They've been very successful with hard work and diligence.
[00:37:53.007 --> 00:37:54.008]  They just want to help the country.
[00:37:54.308 --> 00:37:57.529]  So they're going around trying to finance every libertarian conservative thing they can.
[00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.692]  And then in comes Shapiro, the anointed one that Fox News and the whole system's pushing.
[00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:07.074]  And then he's in my business just like Glenn Beck was.
[00:38:07.114 --> 00:38:08.835]  I told Glenn Beck five years ago on air.
[00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:13.062]  I said, leave me alone, and I will leave you alone.
[00:38:13.643 --> 00:38:18.508]  And for a couple years he did it, and then I learned he was behind the scenes doing it again, so I went after him again.
[00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:27.097]  And it's not hard to go after these people, because they already can't help but sabotage the Christian Libertarian Movement.
[00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:27.838]  They're Judas Coats.
[00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:29.059]  They're operatives.
[00:38:30.982 --> 00:38:31.642]  And that's what they do.
[00:38:32.554 --> 00:38:35.975]  They try to act like they're credible, get control of the movement, and then steer it into the ground.
[00:38:36.576 --> 00:38:40.837]  And they try to make sure the big funds out there go into what they're doing.
[00:38:40.897 --> 00:39:01.466]  And then they bring on Jordan Peterson, who I've been looking at and studying, out of nowhere, doesn't believe in God, but he'll tell you how to wake up, and suddenly The Atlantic and The New York Times like Zeman, he doesn't get censored, and they're all together, and they're gonna have a show, and they're gonna come and merge with Glenn Beck, and how Christian is that to have?
[00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:13.255]  Jordan Peterson, the atheist, that the liberals love, that Bill Maher loves, who explains to us that there are only two genders, and we all go, oh, they let him on Earth say that!
[00:39:13.295 --> 00:39:14.296]  This is so original!
[00:39:14.496 --> 00:39:16.757]  And he gives us some Carl Jung passages, which is fine.
[00:39:16.778 --> 00:39:18.739]  And he's a witty guy.
[00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:19.820]  I think does some good.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.141]  But look, this is going to be the conservative movement.
[00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:23.662]  This is the new leaders of it.
[00:39:25.023 --> 00:39:25.864]  None of them are Christians.
[00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:38.791]  There's somebody else who isn't a Christian, but he prays the same God, the Old Testament, and he would really like to tell you about Shapiro.
[00:39:38.871 --> 00:39:39.791]  Maybe he'll come on.
[00:39:39.831 --> 00:39:40.891]  Maybe it's time for that.
[00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:51.733]  There's another really big talk show host who's, you could say, of the same tribe as Mr. Shapiro, and is a patriot.
[00:39:52.813 --> 00:39:56.254]  He'd like to tell you about Mr. Shapiro, because Shapiro's an atheist as well.
[00:39:57.176 --> 00:39:59.096]  They're not Jews, they're not Christians, they're none of it.
[00:39:59.136 --> 00:40:01.197]  They're establishment individuals, in my view.
[00:40:02.857 --> 00:40:08.758]  And they are now anointed as, oh, they're underground, and now they're all over the system, force-fed to you.
[00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.960]  But just look at what Shapiro's own people said.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.260]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.241]  Ben Shapiro gets an epic Twitter feud with Alex Jones over Kanye West.
[00:40:21.314 --> 00:40:26.498]  And Candace Owens, and it says he destroys Jones with his incredible genius, and it's so stunning.
[00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:31.281]  Using the most sophisticated systems ever seen on Earth, Shapiro annihilates Jones.
[00:40:32.182 --> 00:40:33.823]  Then you actually read what the commenters say.
[00:40:35.945 --> 00:40:43.810]  Jones is supposedly the one unleashing hysterical ad hominems, with Shapiro having sharp, rational rebuttals?
[00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:47.233]  In this exchange?
[00:40:49.574 --> 00:40:50.235]  Is he just
[00:40:52.392 --> 00:40:55.713]  Be supremely foolish to do so because you are a kook!
[00:40:57.654 --> 00:40:59.175]  Well, that sounds like a five-year-old wrote it.
[00:40:59.215 --> 00:40:59.896]  That's what Shapiro said.
[00:41:00.356 --> 00:41:01.257]  Backed up by Cook!
[00:41:01.497 --> 00:41:02.838]  Cook!
[00:41:03.258 --> 00:41:03.999]  Supremely!
[00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:04.959]  Who used supremely?
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.700]  I mean, you're supremely.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.163]  He goes, it would be supremely bad to go on Cook's show.
[00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:10.984]  You go on Cook's show.
[00:41:11.304 --> 00:41:12.445]  Welcome to McDonald's.
[00:41:12.745 --> 00:41:13.706]  I am Ben Shapiro.
[00:41:13.786 --> 00:41:15.007]  May I help you?
[00:41:15.507 --> 00:41:16.648]  I am the big intellect.
[00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:18.990]  You are Cook!
[00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:20.351]  You are Cook!
[00:41:20.992 --> 00:41:22.993]  Okay, wow, that was the rational rebuttal?
[00:41:23.193 --> 00:41:24.995]  Or was it the dude
[00:41:25.775 --> 00:41:29.257]  They shouldn't come on your show because you are awful.
[00:41:29.677 --> 00:41:32.479]  You couldn't come on the show because they're awful.
[00:41:32.979 --> 00:41:34.080]  I am Bill Shapiro.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.101]  I'm so smart.
[00:41:36.762 --> 00:41:38.843]  Or was it the topless photo?
[00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.065]  It's hard to argue with sharp, rational arguments like those.
[00:41:42.805 --> 00:41:43.726]  He's quoting Shapiro.
[00:41:44.844 --> 00:41:46.645]  Writing in third party about what a genius he is.
[00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:53.887]  Shapiro, the devastating person with a 5,000 IQ, who personally severed Hitler's head, and is actually an immortal god.
[00:41:54.467 --> 00:41:55.548]  The ultimate intellectual.
[00:41:55.928 --> 00:41:56.748]  The king of Earth.
[00:41:56.928 --> 00:41:59.309]  He will show us Christians in Texas how to do things.
[00:41:59.669 --> 00:42:07.092]  With Jordan Peterson, who explains to us that we're all just animals programmed, and that he's got a book telling us how to live like robots.
[00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:13.080]  I'm just shaking in the intellect.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.523]  And in almost every comment, and I sort of look at other things on his site, they all hate him.
[00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:19.444]  It's just like Glenn Beck.
[00:42:19.464 --> 00:42:21.084]  They go, the Anointed One is here!
[00:42:21.104 --> 00:42:22.345]  Here is your God!
[00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:23.426]  Worship Him!
[00:42:23.886 --> 00:42:25.927]  And then he endorses Obama and Hillary.
[00:42:30.993 --> 00:42:33.174]  It must have been Shapiro's refusal to even debate Jones.
[00:42:33.555 --> 00:42:41.059]  Nothing screams sharp rationalism like refusing to debate, especially when one's debating skills are routinely highly touted.
[00:42:41.619 --> 00:42:45.382]  We need to get a certain national talk show host on the phone
[00:42:46.756 --> 00:42:48.639]  With the backers of Shapiro.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.790]  I really think these fine Texans should be able to know what they're financing, what they're behind, and what they're doing.
[00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.957]  Because I know Shapiro probably thinks, they're a bunch of self-made country bumpkins.
[00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:01.559]  Let me swoop in there and teach them.
[00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:09.321]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:11.782]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.382 --> 00:43:18.244]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:18.644 --> 00:43:21.285]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:24.586]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:24.947 --> 00:43:30.869]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:38.032]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:44.255]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:44.715 --> 00:43:48.317]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:48.817 --> 00:43:57.021]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.421 --> 00:44:03.664]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:09.134]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[00:44:09.755 --> 00:44:17.881]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.421 --> 00:44:20.082]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:20.643 --> 00:44:27.568]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:27.628 --> 00:44:30.630]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.111]  It's not absorbable.
[00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:33.052]  It's toxic.
[00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:45.864]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's injected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:45.984 --> 00:44:48.506]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:49.247 --> 00:44:57.613]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[00:44:57.633 --> 00:45:01.796]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:02.196 --> 00:45:06.920]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.063]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.343 --> 00:45:15.226]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:15.786 --> 00:45:18.547]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:19.707]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:20.127 --> 00:45:21.487]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:21.907 --> 00:45:24.207]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.247 --> 00:45:27.468]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:27.888 --> 00:45:31.289]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:31.749 --> 00:45:33.869]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:45:34.209 --> 00:45:35.589]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:45:35.929 --> 00:45:43.311]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:43.611 --> 00:45:44.471]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:45.091 --> 00:45:45.231]  Yeah.
[00:46:00.009 --> 00:46:00.609]  I don't think so.
[00:46:16.656 --> 00:46:16.816]  That's
[00:46:36.681 --> 00:46:37.462]  We're good to go.
[00:47:05.808 --> 00:47:08.670]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:19.338]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:47:25.971 --> 00:47:28.593]  Now, I'm going to get into the most important issue, period.
[00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:35.858]  That's human life on this planet, fertility on this planet, massive increases in cancer, and how to stop it, and how to organize.
[00:47:35.958 --> 00:47:47.987]  I've decided I'm going to start printing up pamphlets with mainstream news articles and studies, and walking up and saying, here's the Journal of Medicine, here's the London Telegraph, here's the Associated Press,
[00:47:48.907 --> 00:48:03.515]  Here is the Wall Street Journal, and here is Wired Magazine admitting 5G massively increases cancer when the last decade of just regular 4 and 3G has doubled brain tumors in every Western country.
[00:48:04.036 --> 00:48:06.197]  Doubled!
[00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.738]  A 100% increase!
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.700]  We're going to stop this.
[00:48:14.341 --> 00:48:15.662]  We're going to get this reigned in.
[00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.890]  And we're going to talk about the atrazine.
[00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:24.492]  And it confusing the sexualization and sexual development of men and women.
[00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:26.992]  Accelerating cancer in women and men.
[00:48:28.493 --> 00:48:29.733]  Highly feminizing women.
[00:48:30.513 --> 00:48:31.473]  And feminizing men.
[00:48:33.874 --> 00:48:35.795]  I know Ben Shapiro doesn't want us to talk about it.
[00:48:39.036 --> 00:48:40.076]  And again, Jordan Peterson.
[00:48:40.376 --> 00:48:41.356]  He gets up on Bill Maher.
[00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:41.916]  We have that clip?
[00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:44.037]  And says...
[00:48:45.171 --> 00:48:48.713]  And says, I am not a conservative.
[00:48:49.073 --> 00:48:50.494]  And then he says, there are two genders.
[00:48:50.534 --> 00:48:52.815]  The left's gotten out of control, and we go, oh, you're our God!
[00:48:53.336 --> 00:48:55.477]  You told us what we already all knew, and that's fine!
[00:48:56.497 --> 00:49:01.940]  Except they're all linked up, I know now, behind the scenes, to go take over Glenn Beck's destroyed operation.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.721]  He destroyed himself.
[00:49:04.101 --> 00:49:10.685]  And then it's back to Glenn Beck part two, with Shapiro behind the scenes, like he used to do over at Talk Radio Network.
[00:49:10.805 --> 00:49:12.126]  I know all of it, moron.
[00:49:14.704 --> 00:49:15.804]  The stuff he used to pull there.
[00:49:16.144 --> 00:49:18.285]  You are not pulling that with me.
[00:49:18.525 --> 00:49:19.886]  I am not to be pushed around.
[00:49:20.846 --> 00:49:21.326]  I can't help it.
[00:49:21.346 --> 00:49:21.886]  I'm coming after you.
[00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:22.326]  That's it.
[00:49:23.667 --> 00:49:24.627]  I'm in total war mode.
[00:49:24.667 --> 00:49:25.607]  I'm coming after Soros.
[00:49:25.627 --> 00:49:26.528]  I'm coming after Hillary.
[00:49:26.748 --> 00:49:28.188]  People say, oh, why are you still attacking Hillary?
[00:49:28.348 --> 00:49:29.529]  Because she's coming after me.
[00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:31.409]  You want to fight?
[00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:32.950]  You all of you got one to the end.
[00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.410]  I love it.
[00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:37.091]  That said,
[00:49:38.536 --> 00:49:43.240]  You just think all us conservatives, libertarians, and Christians are a bunch of dumbasses because we're not snakes like you.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.281]  You just waltz in here and take control of our movements.
[00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:45.802]  You can't.
[00:49:48.304 --> 00:49:54.088]  If you're real like Matt Drudge, or real like Michael Savage, or real like Donald Trump, people will love you.
[00:49:54.909 --> 00:49:56.650]  But people know fake when they see it.
[00:49:57.331 --> 00:49:57.931]  And you're fake!
[00:49:58.432 --> 00:50:00.814]  And you plan to move down here again right next door to me?
[00:50:01.094 --> 00:50:01.995]  Leave me alone!
[00:50:03.848 --> 00:50:04.749]  Get out of my business!
[00:50:05.009 --> 00:50:06.451]  Get out of my radio stations!
[00:50:06.511 --> 00:50:09.033]  Get out of my, uh, people who comes on my show!
[00:50:10.114 --> 00:50:14.459]  You got the whole CNN, Fox pushing you, force-feeding you to the geriatric audience.
[00:50:14.939 --> 00:50:15.540]  God bless them.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.862]  We've got the young audience, jackass.
[00:50:18.663 --> 00:50:19.604]  We're trying to wake them up.
[00:50:19.664 --> 00:50:20.385]  Get out of our way.
[00:50:21.566 --> 00:50:24.629]  You keep doing that Cheshire Cat psycho smile, you're gonna find out.
[00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:28.360]  I'm in your business.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.901]  You got mine, buddy.
[00:50:30.642 --> 00:50:32.183]  You threw the first punch, you're gonna get it now.
[00:50:32.503 --> 00:50:33.964]  I put up with years of crap from this guy.
[00:50:34.285 --> 00:50:39.469]  And you can attack me and lie about me all day, but you don't get involved in my operations.
[00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.251]  You understand that, you skunk?
[00:50:42.232 --> 00:50:44.554]  I know the counterfeit's always gotta get rid of the real McCoy.
[00:50:44.794 --> 00:50:46.335]  You're not getting rid of me, son.
[00:50:47.076 --> 00:50:48.977]  People a lot smarter and a lot tougher have tried.
[00:50:49.578 --> 00:50:51.179]  As long as God wants me here, I'm gonna be here.
[00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:53.922]  But I got this thing.
[00:50:54.042 --> 00:50:55.323]  I love people from all over the country.
[00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:07.273]  But the fake Californians, who aren't really Californians, coming here, trying to run my life, trying to run me out of Austin, trying to run me out of Mount State, it's not happening.
[00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.114]  So, he is Glenn Beck.
[00:51:12.354 --> 00:51:15.155]  When you think Ben Shapiro, remember, he was a never-Trumper.
[00:51:20.737 --> 00:51:25.938]  And he thinks he's going to run your life with Jordan Peterson and the rest of these people.
[00:51:29.434 --> 00:51:30.615]  I mean, what is it with Canadians?
[00:51:30.695 --> 00:51:31.516]  I love Canadians.
[00:51:31.536 --> 00:51:32.336]  They're the nicest people.
[00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:34.758]  But we got Peterson is here to run America.
[00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.060]  We got the other Canadian, Ted Cruz.
[00:51:39.021 --> 00:51:39.942]  And I'm sorry, man.
[00:51:39.962 --> 00:51:43.624]  A pair of cowboy boots doesn't make you a Texan.
[00:51:44.065 --> 00:51:45.746]  And listen, I don't care if you're not a Texan.
[00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:53.772]  Just don't put on a fake Texas accent and walk around with your hands in your pockets like you're a Banny Rooster like Ted Cruz does.
[00:51:53.812 --> 00:51:55.113]  He runs every time he sees us.
[00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.383]  We had like the first Ted Cruz interview when he announced for Senate.
[00:52:02.783 --> 00:52:03.483]  And we supported him.
[00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:05.204]  And he has an overall good voting record.
[00:52:05.464 --> 00:52:07.586]  He was good exposing how we were funding ISIS in Syria.
[00:52:07.826 --> 00:52:08.386]  He did the right thing.
[00:52:08.446 --> 00:52:09.187]  I like Ted Cruz.
[00:52:10.647 --> 00:52:12.268]  But he linked up with Glenn Beck.
[00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:17.872]  And he linked up with, and they got all these other Texans to just shell out money.
[00:52:17.932 --> 00:52:20.073]  See, I have my audience supporting us.
[00:52:21.934 --> 00:52:26.617]  We're the only operation other than Matt Drudge that is self-funded by you, the listeners.
[00:52:31.513 --> 00:52:37.257]  But now I realize, if I didn't take the money that other Texas billionaires offered me over the years, what do you want Alex?
[00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:37.577]  10 million?
[00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:38.137]  50 million?
[00:52:38.157 --> 00:52:44.181]  And I'm like, well, we're just growing here, we try to fund ourselves, you know, I don't want to know.
[00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:48.004]  It's not even a pride thing, I just, I love the fact that we're self-funded, self-made.
[00:52:48.884 --> 00:52:50.225]  Like Shapiro's funders.
[00:52:51.646 --> 00:52:57.510]  But it's always some person that isn't self-made who's being financed by somebody that is self-made.
[00:52:58.834 --> 00:53:00.737]  And it's just like Mike Adams said to me off-air the other day.
[00:53:00.757 --> 00:53:04.361]  He said, those of us that are self-made should only work with other self-made people.
[00:53:05.443 --> 00:53:08.427]  Because there's something wrong with the people that aren't self-made.
[00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:09.849]  They always want to hijack.
[00:53:09.869 --> 00:53:12.012]  They always want to take over what somebody else has got.
[00:53:12.032 --> 00:53:13.313]  Because they don't have it.
[00:53:13.854 --> 00:53:14.575]  They don't have it.
[00:53:14.635 --> 00:53:16.358]  Ben Shapiro doesn't have it.
[00:53:17.366 --> 00:53:18.627]  Like Michael Savage has it.
[00:53:19.348 --> 00:53:21.830]  Michael Savage's whole family, everything they touch turns to gold.
[00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.030]  Totally self-made.
[00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:26.874]  Number one best-selling health author ever since the 60s.
[00:53:27.574 --> 00:53:30.076]  Supplements, top names everywhere, you don't even know they own it.
[00:53:30.316 --> 00:53:33.719]  Real estate, everything, just solid gold from his dad's hardware shop.
[00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:35.020]  I know Savage is listening right now.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.521]  He chimed in earlier.
[00:53:40.825 --> 00:53:41.205]  My dad.
[00:53:43.183 --> 00:53:44.564]  Didn't finance me one cent.
[00:53:44.644 --> 00:53:45.105]  Self-made.
[00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:51.590]  And then you always got the geniuses telling us how to run our lives, and academics and everybody, that tell me how to run my life.
[00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:53.191]  Stop telling me how to run my life!
[00:53:55.012 --> 00:54:04.520]  And if you want to try to sell your rich benefactors, your sugar daddies, on buying the Blaze, I think it's a bad buy.
[00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:10.117]  I was offered to buy his satellite contract, his channel, two years ago, three years ago.
[00:54:10.597 --> 00:54:13.940]  And then they reached out through one of the brokers and said, do you want the blaze?
[00:54:15.101 --> 00:54:16.302]  Do I want leprosy?
[00:54:18.885 --> 00:54:20.086]  Do I want to be castrated?
[00:54:20.106 --> 00:54:23.249]  Do I want to hang a millstone around my neck?
[00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:25.211]  Do I want to get in bed with fleas?
[00:54:26.613 --> 00:54:29.676]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:30.096 --> 00:54:33.138]  But the headlines, Ben Shapiro to buy the Blaze.
[00:54:33.378 --> 00:54:34.900]  Wow, that young man's rich.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.101]  How's he doing?
[00:54:36.321 --> 00:54:37.702]  Wow, look, private jets.
[00:54:37.722 --> 00:54:39.684]  Hey, yeah, on other people's money.
[00:54:40.864 --> 00:54:42.366]  From their daddy raising them.
[00:54:42.986 --> 00:54:44.708]  Seven kids in a goat shack.
[00:54:45.828 --> 00:54:47.550]  And now you slide in all slick.
[00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:52.908]  To the West Texas folks, and you tell them how it all gonna be down there!
[00:54:53.308 --> 00:54:57.151]  Why, I bet you even wear some spurs when you come to town, don't you there, Mr. Shapiro?
[00:54:57.472 --> 00:55:00.074]  Gonna fast-talk us all, teach us all how the world does work, don't you?
[00:55:00.894 --> 00:55:01.415]  That's good!
[00:55:01.695 --> 00:55:04.777]  How about you get on your little horsey there and ride your ass back out of town, son?
[00:55:05.358 --> 00:55:08.300]  Cause you're gonna burn down just like Beck, cause you're gonna destroy yourself.
[00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:10.742]  So let it be written, so let it be done.
[00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:12.083]  Now, let's continue.
[00:55:13.427 --> 00:55:14.609]  My benefactors are you!
[00:55:15.129 --> 00:55:18.254]  And I bring you the best water filter on record.
[00:55:18.474 --> 00:55:20.257]  The best air filters at the best prices.
[00:55:20.277 --> 00:55:20.677]  Look them up!
[00:55:21.298 --> 00:55:22.600]  I bring you the very best supplements.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.023]  I bring you the very best t-shirts and all of it.
[00:55:25.063 --> 00:55:26.105]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:31.005]  And I want to thank folks that donate.
[00:55:31.605 --> 00:55:34.867]  And the letters we get from that particular gentleman doesn't want to be recognized in Switzerland.
[00:55:35.327 --> 00:55:38.989]  Nice check came in the mail, a nice cashier check that will go 100%.
[00:55:39.389 --> 00:55:43.812]  It was deposited right in to the accounts at the business to fight the globalists.
[00:55:44.772 --> 00:55:47.314]  You can donate, but the best way to do it is just buy the products.
[00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:48.975]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:55:49.135 --> 00:55:52.857]  And we're here, we're going down, we're Americans, we're going to win.
[00:55:57.349 --> 00:56:00.330]  If we fall like the Alamo, it'll just be an example to all for the big victory to come.
[00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:02.410]  But I have a suspicion we're going to be here in a long time.
[00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:05.011]  We have DNA Force Plus back in stock.
[00:56:05.091 --> 00:56:10.293]  It's now stronger, even more concentrated, and less priced because I made a bigger buy on it.
[00:56:10.753 --> 00:56:17.134]  And it is at least, at regular price, half of what leading competitors sold in medical clinics are.
[00:56:17.314 --> 00:56:18.415]  They don't sell this stuff in stores.
[00:56:18.435 --> 00:56:21.315]  Because nobody's going to buy something that costs $300.
[00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:23.256]  That's with all their markup they put in it.
[00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:24.036]  Well, normally, $120-something.
[00:56:24.056 --> 00:56:24.116]  Now, $74.95.
[00:56:27.267 --> 00:56:33.450]  And there's, what is it, like 40-something, 50-something bucks of stuff, product in that bottle, and then there's the marketing and everything else.
[00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.412]  Nobody sells products like this with a 50-60% markup.
[00:56:37.752 --> 00:56:38.853]  That's what it is right now.
[00:56:38.873 --> 00:56:40.894]  50% off, DNA Force Plus.
[00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:42.194]  Go read all the stuff it does.
[00:56:42.614 --> 00:56:44.635]  You know, with time constraints, I can't even get into all of it.
[00:56:44.655 --> 00:56:47.677]  I had a folder here that had it all, and I've kind of gone crazy here on air.
[00:56:48.647 --> 00:56:55.031]  But it's just learn about the telomeres, learn about nerve regrowth, learn about all of it at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:55.051 --> 00:56:55.311]  Again.
[00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.591]  Oh, also, we're going to have to end the X2 special.
[00:57:03.651 --> 00:57:08.933]  I said yesterday, but groups tend to talk about it some of the day, so we're going to keep it one more day at 25% off.
[00:57:09.193 --> 00:57:11.354]  That's the purest form of deep-earth iodine out there.
[00:57:12.154 --> 00:57:15.975]  Also, 50% off on Suprametal Vitality, and you can get it with a real red pill or alpha power.
[00:57:16.356 --> 00:57:19.277]  Separately, 50% off, or together and get free shipping.
[00:57:19.317 --> 00:57:23.358]  The ultimate game changer, Suprametal Vitality and a bunch of other products that are excellent, 50% off.
[00:57:25.419 --> 00:57:30.264]  Or you can simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:30.764 --> 00:57:32.005]  There's nobody else!
[00:57:33.166 --> 00:57:33.947]  Nobody else!
[00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:35.969]  That's self-funded.
[00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:37.571]  But Matt Drudge and Infowars.
[00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:39.573]  So when you're at DrudgeReport.com, be sure to click on his sponsors.
[00:57:39.953 --> 00:57:41.194]  The point is, remember that.
[00:57:41.594 --> 00:57:42.335]  Americana.
[00:57:42.655 --> 00:57:43.296]  Self-made.
[00:57:43.596 --> 00:57:44.297]  Hardcore.
[00:57:44.537 --> 00:57:45.018]  Texan.
[00:57:45.458 --> 00:57:46.279]  Uncompromising.
[00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:47.220]  And victorious.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.401]  Steering you right.
[00:57:48.621 --> 00:57:49.422]  Shooting you straight.
[00:57:49.622 --> 00:57:50.403]  We need your support.
[00:57:55.731 --> 00:57:57.572]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:57:57.612 --> 00:57:57.892]  Go ahead.
[00:57:58.032 --> 00:58:01.834]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:58:02.034 --> 00:58:07.016]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:58:07.036 --> 00:58:22.243]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:58:22.983 --> 00:58:25.805]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:58:26.486 --> 00:58:30.088]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:58:30.208 --> 00:58:37.072]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immuno wall.
[00:58:37.212 --> 00:58:41.855]  I'm just here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:58:42.316 --> 00:58:44.057]  How they're demonizing my state.
[00:58:44.097 --> 00:58:45.518]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:58:46.238 --> 00:58:47.618]  You have changed my life.
[00:58:47.699 --> 00:58:50.499]  Info Wars has changed my family's life.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.581]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[00:58:56.641 --> 00:59:01.163]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:59:02.043 --> 00:59:03.344]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:59:03.544 --> 00:59:08.847]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:59:08.867 --> 00:59:10.188]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:59:10.228 --> 00:59:10.388]  Yeah.
[00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:12.430]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:13.290]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.011]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.012]  We really appreciate you.
[00:59:16.392 --> 00:59:17.073]  Keep up the fight.
[00:59:17.493 --> 00:59:18.513]  We need to take California back.
[00:59:18.533 --> 00:59:18.914]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:59:18.934 --> 00:59:20.014]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[00:59:20.054 --> 00:59:20.655]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:59:23.038 --> 00:59:24.659]  You think our information is hardcore?
[00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:26.280]  You think our focus is brutal?
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.061]  Try our nutraceuticals.
[00:59:28.341 --> 00:59:29.121]  Try our supplements.

[00:59:55.137 --> 00:59:59.238]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.778 --> 01:00:01.118]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.581]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:18.501]  In the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:19.842 --> 01:00:22.002]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:00:26.209 --> 01:00:28.930]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:35.212]  Coming to you from the heart of the Resistance, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, we have huge breaking news next segment.
[01:00:35.312 --> 01:00:36.132]  Emergency report.
[01:00:36.152 --> 01:00:39.093]  Please tell everyone, however you're listening or watching, to tune in.
[01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:40.954]  You are the Resistance.
[01:00:41.474 --> 01:00:44.475]  Planned Parenthood claims heartbeat an arbitrary standard of life.
[01:00:45.115 --> 01:00:45.936]  So now if you're dead,
[01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:53.902]  Uh, that, you know, just like father and mother don't count, they're not two genders, well now, heartbeat isn't life, so, there's no such thing as life.
[01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.184]  They're God, they define it, that's the way it is.
[01:00:56.224 --> 01:00:57.185]  That's coming up as well.
[01:00:58.362 --> 01:01:05.384]  Meanwhile, we've been sending our reporters out, Owen Schroer and others, to the University of Texas, where a lot of the males think masculinity is bad.
[01:01:06.045 --> 01:01:09.346]  So those video reports are up at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:10.006]  They're pretty important.
[01:01:10.026 --> 01:01:14.247]  In fact, let's retweet those right now for radio listeners that want to see them follow us at Real Alex Jones.
[01:01:14.267 --> 01:01:16.148]  So you've got to see this if you're a radio listener.
[01:01:16.568 --> 01:01:19.029]  But here, let's go ahead and go to that report from the University of Texas.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.764]  Masculinity is... I mean, it's something that's like biological about you, right?
[01:01:24.884 --> 01:01:27.887]  It's not a mental... I don't know why... I'm sorry, this is too good for me.
[01:01:28.427 --> 01:01:28.807]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:28.868 --> 01:01:29.468]  Hold on, ma'am.
[01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:30.949]  Can I get an expansion on that?
[01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:31.470]  No, you cannot.
[01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:32.951]  Why is masculinity made up?
[01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:34.132]  I will not speak to you.
[01:01:34.212 --> 01:01:36.114]  I do not speak to those... But you did just yell at me, though.
[01:01:36.174 --> 01:01:37.355]  You did just yell at me, right?
[01:01:37.415 --> 01:01:38.576]  I did just yell at you.
[01:01:38.636 --> 01:01:39.316]  You're absolutely right.
[01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:40.317]  Okay, but you won't speak to me?
[01:01:40.357 --> 01:01:41.078]  You'll just yell at me?
[01:01:41.158 --> 01:01:43.180]  No, I don't want to speak to you on camera, is what I'm saying.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.520]  Okay.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.562]  But why is masculinity a made-up concept?
[01:01:45.842 --> 01:01:47.703]  Well, I mean, where's masculinity?
[01:01:47.723 --> 01:01:48.504]  Show me where it is.
[01:01:49.224 --> 01:01:50.585]  Well, look about human history.
[01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:57.609]  How about, like, men that rode on horses with pounds and pounds of armor and fought in wars?
[01:01:57.629 --> 01:01:59.330]  What about the Roman gladiators?
[01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.051]  That's masculinity?
[01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:02.912]  That's your definition of masculinity?
[01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:05.934]  Okay, well, what do you think that is if that's not masculinity?
[01:02:06.614 --> 01:02:08.195]  Were there female gladiators?
[01:02:08.335 --> 01:02:08.795]  Yes.
[01:02:09.275 --> 01:02:09.576]  Really?
[01:02:09.736 --> 01:02:10.056]  Yes.
[01:02:10.076 --> 01:02:11.396]  Who were the famous female gladiators?
[01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:13.257]  Who were the famous male gladiators?
[01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:14.918]  Um, there were dozens of them.
[01:02:14.938 --> 01:02:15.658]  There's been movies.
[01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:16.599]  How about Maximus?
[01:02:16.659 --> 01:02:17.679]  How about Maximus Realist?
[01:02:17.739 --> 01:02:18.880]  Oh, come on!
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.940]  You just watch movies.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.321]  That's where you get your information.
[01:02:21.521 --> 01:02:24.022]  So, but you haven't provided one fact, ma'am.
[01:02:24.062 --> 01:02:29.004]  You yelled at me, and then you tried to insult a concept that's been around for thousands of years.
[01:02:30.265 --> 01:02:30.885]  Yeah, alright.
[01:02:30.965 --> 01:02:36.187]  So, how many female soldiers were there in ancient history that fought wars?
[01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:38.447]  What is that?
[01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:39.528]  Ancient history?
[01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:40.728]  Is that ancient history?
[01:02:40.748 --> 01:02:43.089]  So you don't think masculinity is a real thing?
[01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:44.189]  I'm just trying to have a conversation.
[01:02:44.749 --> 01:02:45.549]  I'm just trying to figure it out.
[01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:47.470]  How can masculinity not be a real thing?
[01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:49.471]  So is femininity a real thing?
[01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:49.991]  No.
[01:02:50.571 --> 01:02:52.812]  So there's no such thing as femininity or masculinity?
[01:02:52.832 --> 01:02:53.052]  No.
[01:02:53.252 --> 01:02:57.053]  Women and men just organically don't do the different things?
[01:02:57.133 --> 01:02:57.173]  No.
[01:02:57.873 --> 01:02:59.835]  Women don't like makeup and jewelry.
[01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:01.376]  That's all taught.
[01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:02.898]  That's all taught, really.
[01:03:03.018 --> 01:03:05.040]  How many women do you see here with makeup on?
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.021]  How many women do you see?
[01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:09.744]  I would guess that probably half of them are wearing some sort of makeup, including yourself.
[01:03:10.045 --> 01:03:11.106]  No, no.
[01:03:11.126 --> 01:03:12.107]  I have no makeup on.
[01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:12.987]  Okay, good for you.
[01:03:13.027 --> 01:03:13.848]  I'm just saying.
[01:03:13.928 --> 01:03:16.931]  So femininity doesn't exist and masculinity doesn't exist.
[01:03:17.432 --> 01:03:20.755]  So are there any differences between men and women at all?
[01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:24.193]  Are there any differences between men and women?
[01:03:24.913 --> 01:03:25.973]  Fundamentally no.
[01:03:26.293 --> 01:03:27.133]  Fundamentally no?
[01:03:27.354 --> 01:03:27.534]  No.
[01:03:27.654 --> 01:03:28.814]  Like having children?
[01:03:30.054 --> 01:03:33.135]  Your reproductive organs?
[01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:34.176]  Your body structure?
[01:03:34.196 --> 01:03:35.416]  That is not a definition.
[01:03:35.456 --> 01:03:36.376]  Your mental makeup?
[01:03:36.556 --> 01:03:37.637]  Your brain chemistry?
[01:03:37.677 --> 01:03:38.937]  Now you've gone too far.
[01:03:39.117 --> 01:03:40.258]  This is all scientific.
[01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:43.178]  This is all biological.
[01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:45.259]  Men and women are different.
[01:03:45.319 --> 01:03:46.299]  They have different brains.
[01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:47.060]  They have different bodies.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.360]  No!
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.641]  Yes, they do.
[01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:50.661]  Yes, they do.
[01:03:50.921 --> 01:03:51.602]  Yes, they do.
[01:03:52.122 --> 01:03:54.063]  In fact, they deal with pain differently.
[01:03:54.103 --> 01:03:54.883]  They deal with everything.
[01:03:54.903 --> 01:03:56.124]  They deal with emotion differently.
[01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:57.244]  This is science.
[01:03:58.405 --> 01:03:59.426]  Are you a professor?
[01:03:59.446 --> 01:04:00.406]  I don't understand.
[01:04:00.446 --> 01:04:01.747]  This is basic psychology.
[01:04:01.787 --> 01:04:02.607]  No, it is not.
[01:04:02.647 --> 01:04:03.447]  Yes, it is.
[01:04:04.068 --> 01:04:06.949]  Why don't you take a psychology class at University of Texas and find out?
[01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:07.529]  Psychology!
[01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:15.563]  So I'm just trying to figure out, so you don't think there's differences between men and women?
[01:04:15.823 --> 01:04:18.465]  This is amazing, and this is a professor I bet here.
[01:04:19.085 --> 01:04:25.728]  Basic human biology, basic human anatomy, basic human psychology, and they deny all of it.
[01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:28.529]  And then they think I'm a bad guy for just reporting on it.
[01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:30.050]  I'm not even trying to pick a fight with you.
[01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:35.593]  I'm just out here saying, look, they say masculinity is a mental health issue, you say it doesn't even exist.
[01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:40.155]  So that means that the University of Texas is addressing something that you think is made up.
[01:04:40.695 --> 01:04:42.877]  Don't you think that should be an issue?
[01:04:42.897 --> 01:04:44.718]  You know what I think is a mental health issue?
[01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:47.040]  People who deny science and biology.
[01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:50.964]  I think it's a mental health issue to think there's 77 different genders.
[01:04:51.344 --> 01:04:51.965]  There's two.
[01:04:52.365 --> 01:04:54.807]  As soon as you come out the womb, you can determine it.
[01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:55.768]  It's real simple.
[01:04:56.048 --> 01:04:56.849]  I'm no doctor.
[01:04:56.869 --> 01:04:59.331]  We gotta give Owen Troyer a raise.
[01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:01.272]  The guy is unbelievable.
[01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:08.959]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:05:09.679 --> 01:05:12.960]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:21.224]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:05:21.865 --> 01:05:28.188]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[01:05:29.028 --> 01:05:34.253]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:05:34.874 --> 01:05:47.006]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:05:47.546 --> 01:05:50.307]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:25.999]  Now the topic we're about to cover is undoubtedly one of the most important on the planet and
[01:06:44.418 --> 01:07:12.903]  I have been given a lot of information by high-level sources that I could then go verify in open research, and then I talked to group last week at length, and then we talked again this morning at length, and we are definitely going to put together the final dots of something so nightmarish, so complete, so total, so documented, that it makes the head spin.
[01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:29.427]  We're going to tie the 5G network together with the smart grid, with the smart dust, with the Internet of Things, with how it surveils you in your house, how it physically can watch you with the electromagnetic radiation, how it's giving you cancer, and how it's destroying the atmosphere.
[01:07:31.291 --> 01:07:36.193]  So they're getting us ready for all this global warming and societal collapse that they're predicting at the Defense Department and everywhere else.
[01:07:36.213 --> 01:07:37.273]  That's because it's being done.
[01:07:37.293 --> 01:07:39.594]  And here are just a few of the articles that back this up.
[01:07:39.614 --> 01:07:40.714]  We're getting into it in the next segment.
[01:07:40.994 --> 01:07:49.817]  But I want you to tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, everybody on your Facebook, your Twitter, everybody needs to tune in now because this is so devastating.
[01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.858]  I had tears in my eyes this morning talking to Dr. Gribb.
[01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:55.059]  We were finishing each other's sentences because it's all admitted.
[01:07:55.922 --> 01:07:59.964]  Just like we told you there's special operations, black helicopters conditioning us for martial law.
[01:08:00.204 --> 01:08:01.545]  That's now CBS News today.
[01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:03.105]  It's bigger than Trump.
[01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:03.706]  It's the deep state.
[01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:07.047]  Just like we told you the Atrazine is causing the frogs to be sterile.
[01:08:07.547 --> 01:08:08.348]  That's all admitted.
[01:08:08.688 --> 01:08:09.408]  This is admitted.
[01:08:09.428 --> 01:08:10.569]  And here's the metaphysical rule.
[01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:13.970]  They have to tell you what they're going to do ahead of time.
[01:08:14.551 --> 01:08:15.851]  And that's why they're doing all this.
[01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:17.692]  They're telling you it's giving you cancer.
[01:08:17.732 --> 01:08:18.312]  It's killing you.
[01:08:18.352 --> 01:08:19.313]  It's worse than cigarettes.
[01:08:21.303 --> 01:08:37.814]  I've got the Associated Press, I've got Scientific American, I've got Popular Mechanics, Popular Science last week saying, here's the CIA manual of using electromagnetic cell phone radiation to control your mind.
[01:08:38.494 --> 01:08:44.978]  And they just put it out as it all rolls out, and then people like Ben Shapiro and others attack us for talking about it.
[01:08:45.258 --> 01:08:48.941]  Because there's talking points go out to the left and the controlled right.
[01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:52.996]  No one listens to the left, but the controlled right is critical.
[01:08:53.896 --> 01:08:58.497]  So, we're going to be breaking all of this down, but first I wanted to just thank Dr. Gritt for being here with us.
[01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:00.597]  Well, thanks for having me on.
[01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:04.138]  It's always a pleasure to come on the show and reveal this information.
[01:09:04.818 --> 01:09:12.680]  It's a rabbit hole that you and I, it basically confirms every single thing that you've been talking about for 23 years or however long you've been on the air.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.761]  And what the grand plan is,
[01:09:17.521 --> 01:09:22.364]  And kind of what started it for me was the disease X that came out not too long ago.
[01:09:22.764 --> 01:09:31.108]  All of the hard pushes on the vaccines and the flu shots, all of the electromagnetic... Which the studies admit make you get sick and make you more susceptible the next year.
[01:09:31.128 --> 01:09:39.953]  All of the AI technology we were talking about, the blockchain, all of that stuff, it all came together and as I was looking at
[01:09:41.226 --> 01:09:42.627]  You know, let's piece all this together.
[01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:49.350]  We talk about fluoride in the water, we talk about this, we talk about that, but this is, this is the grand plan of things.
[01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:53.112]  This is what DARPA, this is the information they hope never gets out.
[01:09:53.412 --> 01:09:59.295]  And we were able to reverse engineer it, but now, they now admit it in all their literature exactly as we said.
[01:10:00.282 --> 01:10:01.003]  Exactly.
[01:10:01.423 --> 01:10:02.284]  Because you can see it.
[01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:03.705]  Plus, it's always been admitted.
[01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:13.533]  It's like Tinker Toys or an Erector set or these house kits you can buy that come on the back of an 18-wheeler and you build the house in a week.
[01:10:13.954 --> 01:10:14.955]  You see all the pieces.
[01:10:14.995 --> 01:10:15.595]  You can look at it.
[01:10:15.615 --> 01:10:21.640]  It's like you put more and more of the puzzle pieces in together and we're not seeing patterns that we want to see.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.242]  We see the pattern and the final pieces are going in.
[01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:27.783]  And again, they're metaphysically admitting all this, so it's coming up in the next segment.
[01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:28.263]  Okay.
[01:10:28.944 --> 01:10:39.468]  But I just want everybody to know that I'm begging you, because I already have people walking up to me in the street like they do 20 years ago and saying, are the black helicopters gonna get me?
[01:10:40.188 --> 01:10:44.750]  And here it is, CBS News, black helicopters terrorize New Jersey, explosions, machine guns.
[01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:46.531]  We can roll some of that for people that just tuned in.
[01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:54.200]  You get tomorrow's news today, you get next decade's news today, you get the news of 20-plus years from now today, because it was already going on.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.401]  They're now at the point of, yeah, we're watching you.
[01:10:56.901 --> 01:11:00.983]  Yeah, your smart meter actually can see you, just like a body scanner.
[01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:08.067]  You know, six years ago, the Kinect came out, Microsoft, and, quote, hackers got in and showed they could show people in their house and see through walls.
[01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:11.178]  It's all by design.
[01:11:11.238 --> 01:11:17.404]  It's a race to get these devices, these HomeAid, Alexa's, Google Assistant in your house.
[01:11:17.604 --> 01:11:18.285]  They're watching.
[01:11:18.365 --> 01:11:19.006]  They're listening.
[01:11:19.246 --> 01:11:19.847]  They're tracking.
[01:11:19.907 --> 01:11:22.289]  It's AI surveillance nodes everywhere.
[01:11:22.689 --> 01:11:23.490]  Your smartphone.
[01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:25.452]  The Chinese government's rolling it out.
[01:11:25.472 --> 01:11:26.453]  They call it Skynet.
[01:11:26.693 --> 01:11:27.894]  It's being adopted by Apple.
[01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:29.015]  Apple's moved there.
[01:11:29.716 --> 01:11:30.376]  Tax exempt.
[01:11:30.897 --> 01:11:33.138]  They gave China all your Apple IDs three months ago.
[01:11:33.278 --> 01:11:35.299]  You cannot make up the magnitude.
[01:11:35.579 --> 01:11:45.164]  Obama gave them the Office of Personnel Management 22 million files on government agents, their connections, their operatives, their informants, their whole files.
[01:11:46.064 --> 01:11:52.506]  Where they live, what they do, so that that could be given back to the Democrats and universities to then not hire any patriots.
[01:11:53.186 --> 01:11:55.046]  This is a takedown operation.
[01:11:55.286 --> 01:12:11.570]  Just like the NSA uses the British NSA to spy on us to get around the law and we spy on them, the globalists are using the Chinese to run the operating systems in a parallel NSA jacked in to Microsoft, Google, Apple, all of them.
[01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:12.691]  They've already merged.
[01:12:13.011 --> 01:12:14.011]  We've already merged with China.
[01:12:15.051 --> 01:12:19.173]  So, and Trump is just desperately in there trying to... He doesn't even fully understand this.
[01:12:19.213 --> 01:12:20.413]  He's just now getting briefed on it.
[01:12:20.433 --> 01:12:20.734]  Go ahead.
[01:12:21.294 --> 01:12:23.355]  No, that's exactly what's happening.
[01:12:24.535 --> 01:12:32.799]  There's such a diversion that happens all the time because they're trying to create this excitement and people are getting excited about...
[01:12:33.499 --> 01:12:36.721]  I'll be able to download the movie in one second.
[01:12:51.731 --> 01:13:04.638]  All of the electromagnetic frequencies, whether it's milliliter wave, whether it's RF frequency, EMF, what started this project was trying to figure out what can we do to protect people.
[01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:10.622]  Because right now on the WHO website they list electrosensitivity, hypersensitivity disorder.
[01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:16.185]  It's starting to become mainstream where people are, because of the smart meters, because of the cell phones, because of the
[01:13:16.983 --> 01:13:28.872]  iPads because of all of the electronics the routers the Wi-Fi all of this stuff that were Bombarded more and more and more with harmful electromagnetic radiation, so I'm thinking
[01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:31.118]  What can we find?
[01:13:31.158 --> 01:13:33.119]  Like, what can we do to protect the body?
[01:13:33.559 --> 01:13:35.521]  And then one thing led to another, which led to another.
[01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:41.845]  And we're going to go through all the science, all the documentation, all the mainstream admissions, where they're like on a cigarette pack, it tells you it can kill you.
[01:13:42.225 --> 01:13:45.828]  They're telling you, this is killing you, and we're going to up the power, but here's the deal.
[01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.449]  If I don't want to smoke cigarettes, I can not smoke them.
[01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:51.231]  And I can keep my kids away from it.
[01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:56.715]  This is like being on an airplane, everybody's smoking cigarettes again, and you're breathing it in, but it's Wi-Fi pollution.
[01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:57.696]  We have rights.
[01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:05.770]  That's why they've got, in all these movies and all these shows, like Better Call Saul, making fun of the brother, the bad lawyer, who's hurting the good lawyer.
[01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.552]  He's mentally ill and thinks Wi-Fi's hurting him.
[01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:14.896]  And again, we have all the documents, all the admissions, the deformities, the brain tumors.
[01:14:14.956 --> 01:14:16.797]  It manipulates the heart.
[01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:19.139]  The heart's even more electrochemical than the brain in the areas.
[01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:22.581]  It's got the most concentrated electrochemical cells in the body that fire it.
[01:14:22.761 --> 01:14:24.042]  When those go out, you've got to get a pacemaker.
[01:14:24.741 --> 01:14:27.141]  Well, you hear about Wi-Fi messing up pacemakers.
[01:14:27.682 --> 01:14:29.482]  This is beyond that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:30.262 --> 01:14:30.882]  This is beyond that.
[01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:32.082]  It's messing up the heart cells.
[01:14:32.102 --> 01:14:33.243]  So, we're going to go to break.
[01:14:33.263 --> 01:14:35.303]  Just briefly, because I never plug, I got to finance our operation.
[01:14:35.883 --> 01:14:37.783]  You helped us develop DNA Force.
[01:14:37.803 --> 01:14:40.364]  We have DNA Force Plus now, even stronger, lower price.
[01:14:41.164 --> 01:14:43.904]  It is 50% off, out of the gates.
[01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:46.865]  You can read the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force.
[01:14:46.885 --> 01:14:48.065]  This is just more of the same.
[01:14:48.745 --> 01:14:51.186]  Helps support heart function and cellular energy production.
[01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:52.306]  Flagship.
[01:14:53.346 --> 01:15:06.142]  Telemere Support and Longevity Formula supports optimal mental health, supports healthy skin, supports heart and body and blood vessel health, promotes energy production, helps support central nervous systems, helps support cellular energy production.
[01:15:07.113 --> 01:15:10.735]  Your body's CoQ10 levels tend to decrease up to the age of 20.
[01:15:11.135 --> 01:15:16.218]  CoQ10 is an antioxidant supplement that supports heart health and promotes the production of energy in the body.
[01:15:16.619 --> 01:15:19.080]  There's the PQQ, which is even more critical.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.223]  Promotes cardiovascular health, antioxidant support health, and blood vessel function.
[01:15:23.283 --> 01:15:25.884]  Recommended for long-term heart health support.
[01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:27.365]  This stuff, even the FDA lets you say.
[01:15:28.186 --> 01:15:29.707]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[01:15:29.927 --> 01:15:31.468]  Top scientists agree that this
[01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:36.471]  Tokyo 10 and PQQ and all of this that's in here is over-the-top.
[01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:44.956]  And this is the real stuff, not the synthetic crap that you don't absorb, where they have little tiny bottles up at the store for 40, 50, 60 bucks that are a third of the dose we put of each ingredient in here.
[01:15:45.297 --> 01:15:47.398]  It'd take hundreds of dollars to get all this in one pill.
[01:15:48.319 --> 01:15:48.659]  It's not.
[01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:49.439]  It's $74.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.022]  It is the ultimate deal, and the money we make off it funds the operation.
[01:15:53.302 --> 01:15:54.463]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.184]  Please check it out today.
[01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:58.125]  A lot of other big specials end today, like X2.
[01:15:58.305 --> 01:15:59.046]  It's gotta end today.
[01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:16.925]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:25.514]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:26.932 --> 01:16:29.452]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.673]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:34.613 --> 01:16:36.794]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:43.675]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:52.217]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:53.197 --> 01:16:54.157]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:55.586 --> 01:17:02.429]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:02.929 --> 01:17:04.230]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:06.731]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:19.666]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:20.367 --> 01:17:21.908]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:22.608 --> 01:17:34.235]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:34.815 --> 01:17:36.997]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:38.035 --> 01:17:47.042]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:53.027]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:54.168 --> 01:18:02.034]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:12.530]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:14.511]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:15.511 --> 01:18:18.172]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:18.953 --> 01:18:20.793]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:20.813 --> 01:18:25.716]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:26.816 --> 01:18:37.582]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:37.642 --> 01:18:41.585]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:43.012 --> 01:18:43.672]  Our game changing.
[01:18:44.093 --> 01:18:45.593]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:45.794 --> 01:18:46.954]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:50.576]  It's now stronger and a lower price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:50.876 --> 01:18:51.997]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[01:18:52.077 --> 01:18:56.419]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:56.979 --> 01:19:00.161]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:19:00.181 --> 01:19:01.342]  It just does incredible things.
[01:19:01.762 --> 01:19:03.223]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:06.204]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:08.766]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:14.108]  That's 4 to 5 of Choletal Silver and Iodine and other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:14.728 --> 01:19:31.313]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of Choletal Silver out there, Silver Sol, Nano Silver, Iodine, the ionized water, Stevia, Peppermint,
[01:19:31.713 --> 01:19:33.194]  Essential oil and so much more.
[01:19:33.234 --> 01:19:34.535]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:34.735 --> 01:19:35.935]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:36.335 --> 01:19:42.619]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:42.919 --> 01:19:44.319]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:44.339 --> 01:19:53.924]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:54.244 --> 01:19:57.286]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:06.292 --> 01:20:10.813]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.414 --> 01:20:29.177]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:29.678 --> 01:20:31.138]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:34.907 --> 01:20:38.289]  So, if you just joined us, please pay attention.
[01:20:38.429 --> 01:20:38.870]  Please.
[01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:41.411]  This is the most important thing you can do for yourself and your family.
[01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:46.835]  This is an emergency public service announcement in the next 45 minutes we have left in this hour or so.
[01:20:46.855 --> 01:20:49.517]  And we've got Project Veritas coming on.
[01:20:49.677 --> 01:20:51.218]  James O'Keefe with huge breaking news as well.
[01:20:51.238 --> 01:20:58.403]  You have to understand, Bill and Melinda Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Ted Turner,
[01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:04.891]  David Rockefeller, the late David Rockefeller, Warren Buffett, they're all part of a eugenics cult.
[01:21:05.271 --> 01:21:06.151]  They admit they are.
[01:21:06.631 --> 01:21:12.953]  Their parents and people were the heads of Planned Parenthood, OSS operators, Cold Spring Harbor heads.
[01:21:13.854 --> 01:21:18.655]  That was the eugenics facility in New York that actually ran the Nazi operations through World War II.
[01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.596]  You cannot make this up.
[01:21:22.025 --> 01:21:23.866]  This is bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[01:21:24.086 --> 01:21:27.368]  There have been New York Times best-selling books written on IBM and the Holocaust.
[01:21:27.788 --> 01:21:29.469]  Please write all this down.
[01:21:30.809 --> 01:21:32.030]  5G and hundreds of studies.
[01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:33.951]  I'm going to want groups talking for TV audience.
[01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:34.911]  You'll be able to see it.
[01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:37.632]  Radio listeners, you can just search engine everything he says.
[01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:38.373]  It'll be right there.
[01:21:39.753 --> 01:21:39.994]  5G.
[01:21:41.214 --> 01:21:41.995]  Regular 4 and 3G.
[01:21:43.544 --> 01:21:50.747]  Associated Press, London Guardian, they have to even admit it because they're telling you like on the cigarette package, it'll kill you.
[01:21:50.927 --> 01:21:52.067]  They morally have to tell you.
[01:21:53.748 --> 01:21:55.088]  But then they just kind of hide it in the back.
[01:21:55.788 --> 01:21:57.369]  Wired Magazine, brain tumors double.
[01:21:57.589 --> 01:21:58.629]  Scientists say it's cell phones.
[01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:02.111]  It's directly right where the cell phone is, right where the transmitter is.
[01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:03.931]  It's microwave, it raises the brain temperature.
[01:22:04.251 --> 01:22:05.192]  That's in the Washington Post.
[01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:06.952]  A degree after about 15 minutes.
[01:22:07.312 --> 01:22:08.413]  5G's are even stronger.
[01:22:09.403 --> 01:22:11.244]  And they're in your Kinect boxes.
[01:22:11.284 --> 01:22:14.326]  They're in your, uh, Xboxes.
[01:22:15.967 --> 01:22:17.428]  There it is, Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:22:17.448 --> 01:22:20.549]  Biological effects of electromagnetic radiation, radio waves, and microwaves.
[01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.671]  Eurasian communist countries.
[01:22:24.432 --> 01:22:26.833]  And they're getting into tests going on in the 50s and 60s for that.
[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:32.395]  So, and it's in the Daily Mail, it's in Popular Mechanics last week, in Popular Science.
[01:22:32.696 --> 01:22:34.838]  It's everything I told you, word for word.
[01:22:34.978 --> 01:22:35.979]  It was always in the literature.
[01:22:35.999 --> 01:22:37.621]  Now Dr. Group's going to have the floor now.
[01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:44.009]  I'm going to try to just have these articles and go over them for people and direct the document cam here, but this is real.
[01:22:44.389 --> 01:22:45.190]  This is confirmed.
[01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:50.975]  And you can't just, oh yeah, it gives you cancer, but I'm used to seeing cat pictures on it or my grandchildren or whatever.
[01:22:51.456 --> 01:22:52.616]  They're upping the power.
[01:22:53.097 --> 01:22:58.481]  They're hiding the cell towers now as fake trees and fake cactuses and fake power poles.
[01:22:58.901 --> 01:22:59.342]  They're not.
[01:23:01.994 --> 01:23:05.716]  So they have new large-scale studies and brain tumors are exploding.
[01:23:06.016 --> 01:23:08.497]  Children, 60 years ago, cancer was unknown.
[01:23:09.077 --> 01:23:11.478]  Doctors would fly across the country to find a child with cancer.
[01:23:11.838 --> 01:23:15.280]  Now I walk into a mall or go anywhere, a third of the kids are on chemotherapy.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.300]  Their heads are shaved.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:16.820]  They're dying.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:22.923]  This is a slow-motion, ambient holocaust against everybody.
[01:23:23.683 --> 01:23:24.824]  There is a worldwide holocaust.
[01:23:24.844 --> 01:23:30.306]  Just like the Washington Post reported, 80 million girls are estimated to have been aborted in China.
[01:23:32.005 --> 01:23:38.989]  But now they think up to 30 million may have been hidden for decades, and then would have other sisters and share identities.
[01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.431]  When they're caught sharing identities, they're sent to forced labor.
[01:23:42.071 --> 01:23:44.833]  Now they have Netflix movies about that in the future, and ooh, it's evil.
[01:23:45.093 --> 01:23:45.894]  It's going on!
[01:23:46.714 --> 01:23:47.295]  30 million!
[01:23:47.615 --> 01:23:48.956]  Even the Washington Post admits it.
[01:23:49.456 --> 01:23:50.457]  How is that not a movie?
[01:23:50.657 --> 01:23:51.538]  How is that not a show?
[01:23:51.718 --> 01:23:56.841]  And how are the Communist Chinese the model of what we're becoming?
[01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:57.381]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:23:57.722 --> 01:24:01.164]  If they could hide 30 million kids from the state, how beautiful a story is that?
[01:24:02.025 --> 01:24:03.206]  Where are the feminists celebrating that?
[01:24:03.226 --> 01:24:04.027]  Where's the feminists?
[01:24:04.047 --> 01:24:05.809]  They don't want to celebrate the body of women.
[01:24:06.069 --> 01:24:08.851]  They want to say they represent women, but they're attacking you.
[01:24:10.433 --> 01:24:15.477]  Because they're a cultist and they're satanist, and the biggest sacrifice is to kill the goddess energy.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.762]  Now, I'm not saying I believe all this.
[01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:18.303]  I'm a Christian.
[01:24:18.323 --> 01:24:27.535]  The point is, they believe it, they're attacking the earth, rewriting it, raping it, while telling you, oh, it's getting sick, we're going to save it, get rid of the carbon dioxide that is the life.
[01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.639]  And what do the smart meters do on the studies I'm going to show you?
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:31.761]  They fry.
[01:24:32.796 --> 01:24:35.039]  The atmosphere and actually destroy the ozone.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.327]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most diabolical, it's like they're spraying the aluminum dioxide in the jet fuel and the patents it's added.
[01:24:41.648 --> 01:24:42.569]  The airlines don't know.
[01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:43.790]  It just adds it.
[01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:45.433]  We know they're real ice crystal trails.
[01:24:45.453 --> 01:24:46.033]  We're not saying that.
[01:24:46.294 --> 01:24:49.418]  NASA says the Earth's 31% darker than it was 50 years ago from the trails.
[01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:50.119]  They're persistent.
[01:24:50.479 --> 01:24:53.581]  Not all of them have it because not all of them buy the fuel from the three main suppliers.
[01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:57.643]  Now they've announced a plan to mount giant 5G and beyond.
[01:24:57.663 --> 01:24:59.344]  They're gonna go right to 10G.
[01:24:59.724 --> 01:25:00.645]  Super high power.
[01:25:00.685 --> 01:25:01.945]  You're gonna be fried when you're on that plane.
[01:25:02.145 --> 01:25:03.886]  Not just from the radiation above the water level.
[01:25:04.186 --> 01:25:05.607]  There's 10 feet of water in the 30,000 feet.
[01:25:05.627 --> 01:25:07.588]  That's a shield here on the ground.
[01:25:07.788 --> 01:25:08.929]  About 30,000 feet you're getting what?
[01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:10.970]  Equivalent of multiple chest x-rays every time you fly.
[01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:12.931]  Well, they say seven chest x-rays, but I digress.
[01:25:13.311 --> 01:25:16.053]  You're gonna now have giant, giant,
[01:25:17.202 --> 01:25:33.884]  Dishes on the bottom that supply everyone on the ground so they never don't have Wi-Fi and you're gonna be fried when you're that close to a transmitter It's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, and it's all going in it's all happening It's all being put in place, and it's burning the atmosphere so
[01:25:34.585 --> 01:25:38.208]  Without further ado, Dr. McCamm here, you have the floor for the rest of the hour.
[01:25:38.228 --> 01:25:38.468]  Go ahead.
[01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:46.715]  All right, so to start off, the root cause analysis of what's really going on, and it's the grand plan.
[01:25:47.136 --> 01:25:50.959]  And recently we had the disease X announcement by the World Health Organization.
[01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:55.103]  We recently had the leaked document on mind control.
[01:25:55.903 --> 01:26:02.304]  There's a purpose for that, because when you start looking back at mind control, it dates back ages.
[01:26:02.364 --> 01:26:08.666]  I mean, DARPA's been working on it, the CIA, the NSA, we all know that all of our information is taken and consumed.
[01:26:09.306 --> 01:26:12.727]  So, there's different pieces of the puzzle that come into this.
[01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:21.588]  Ultimate plan that the globalists want is that the government gets what it has always strived to get.
[01:26:21.668 --> 01:26:23.589]  I say the government, but more or less
[01:26:24.454 --> 01:26:35.620]  They run the government, so what they want is unlimited, complete mind control, and no more individuality or thinking for yourself.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:44.004]  Now, all the information that I pulled out basically is leading to an agenda where they're trying to, it's a transhumanistic agenda,
[01:26:44.761 --> 01:26:52.386]  Where they can control the population by merging AI and controlling the mind through electromagnetic radiation.
[01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:55.588]  And not only that, but controlling the environment as well.
[01:26:56.829 --> 01:27:00.030]  Elon Musk, beware world leaders calling for AI gods.
[01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:01.411]  Let's pull that up.
[01:27:01.451 --> 01:27:02.212]  The world government plan.
[01:27:02.232 --> 01:27:06.214]  They want to make it so sick we can't have kids or live without the transhuman movement.
[01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:06.675]  That's the goal.
[01:27:07.335 --> 01:27:10.916]  They want you to be part of a mind, a hive, basically.
[01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:14.717]  That's why they're trying to induce everybody to come into these smart cities.
[01:27:14.857 --> 01:27:16.397]  That's why they're inducing the autonomy.
[01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:19.818]  Because they know we're about to go to the level, it's been proven, where we do it naturally.
[01:27:20.258 --> 01:27:23.739]  They want to create a counterfeit before we hit the next level.
[01:27:24.179 --> 01:27:30.100]  They're laughing at us right now because no one is even recognizing this and no one is even talking about the implications.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.121]  Everybody's just cheering up and down that
[01:27:32.701 --> 01:27:38.926]  Oh, we're going to have these smart cities, and it's going to be environmentally friendly, and everybody's going to be able to download videos so much sooner.
[01:27:38.946 --> 01:27:44.571]  I mean, Apple, when they put their antenna, they put it on the back of the infertility pad, not the front.
[01:27:47.006 --> 01:27:48.828]  Everything being out in the open.
[01:27:48.908 --> 01:27:50.529]  One of the companies, which is Artemis.
[01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:58.837]  Oh, by the way, when I talked to Alex this morning on the phone, as soon as I hung up the phone with you, one minute later I have it documented on my phone.
[01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:06.324]  I have an unknown caller calling my phone and it's blank on the other end for like three or four seconds when I answer it and just a click.
[01:28:07.304 --> 01:28:10.227]  So every, they're listening to every, they listen to every single thing we said.
[01:28:10.267 --> 01:28:20.576]  That was a warning sign basically saying don't, you know, come out publicly and talk about all this because when you start... And by the way, I get briefed by high-level Patriot CIA people and top generals.
[01:28:20.596 --> 01:28:22.118]  I mean, the fact that that goes on is nothing.
[01:28:22.138 --> 01:28:22.698]  That's all admitted.
[01:28:22.718 --> 01:28:25.280]  That's just, and the next thing is they'll threaten to cut your head off.
[01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:25.921]  That's what happens.
[01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:26.422]  But yeah, go ahead.
[01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:31.882]  Well this, this all leaks into the chemtrails.
[01:28:31.942 --> 01:28:33.244]  It leaks into the vaccines.
[01:28:33.304 --> 01:28:37.948]  It leaks into the... We're going to connect the total agenda, just like you did this morning, lay it all out.
[01:28:38.248 --> 01:28:39.169]  This is it, folks.
[01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.891]  We're going to show you all the documents.
[01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:42.072]  It's burning the atmosphere.
[01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:43.293]  It's killing the animals.
[01:28:43.553 --> 01:28:45.816]  It's breaking all the DNA, all the RNA.
[01:28:46.056 --> 01:28:47.077]  It's not just killing us.
[01:28:47.537 --> 01:28:50.260]  Remember, a lot of liberals have been trained, good, get rid of the humans.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.741]  No, no, it's killing the earth.
[01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:52.822]  It's killing the honeybees.
[01:28:53.182 --> 01:28:54.583]  It is so satanic.
[01:28:54.643 --> 01:28:56.485]  It's killing Mother Earth.
[01:28:56.645 --> 01:29:02.009]  They want to sacrifice the planet in a giant sacrifice and then bring in the new age.
[01:29:02.869 --> 01:29:06.452]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:29:06.852 --> 01:29:09.274]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:29:09.595 --> 01:29:13.938]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:29:14.378 --> 01:29:16.259]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.761]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[01:30:11.442 --> 01:30:15.504]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:30:16.005 --> 01:30:18.346]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:30:19.146 --> 01:30:22.268]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:30:23.772 --> 01:30:35.918]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:51.667]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[01:30:58.679 --> 01:31:00.923]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:23.052]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:31:23.152 --> 01:31:28.576]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:31:29.437 --> 01:31:30.117]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:31:30.538 --> 01:31:33.400]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.001]  And so much more.
[01:31:35.581 --> 01:31:36.722]  It is concentrated.
[01:31:36.942 --> 01:31:38.644]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:31:38.664 --> 01:31:44.368]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:31:44.468 --> 01:31:45.669]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:31:45.689 --> 01:31:47.631]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:50.093]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:31:50.293 --> 01:31:51.554]  I think it's beyond seasonal.

[01:31:54.096 --> 01:31:54.696]  Immune Wall.

[01:32:18.936 --> 01:32:23.740]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.891]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.246 --> 01:33:44.414]  Alright, if you're here with us, we're going over mainline studies, mainline science that wireless radiation is now killing more people than cigarettes, and they're massively upping the power.
[01:33:45.095 --> 01:33:49.098]  They've got aircraft now mounting at the bottom, broadcasting it, including commercial aircraft.
[01:33:50.928 --> 01:33:53.671]  And then you get into the architecture.
[01:33:53.731 --> 01:34:01.398]  The White House is built with the oval office is supposed to be again the uterus and and it's in the Illuminati.
[01:34:01.438 --> 01:34:06.002]  It's all this architecture of symbols of things on a smaller scale to go bigger.
[01:34:06.303 --> 01:34:08.605]  You've got the big phallic symbol of the
[01:34:08.945 --> 01:34:10.286]  George Washington Monument out there.
[01:34:10.346 --> 01:34:11.888]  You've got the White House.
[01:34:11.908 --> 01:34:14.050]  You've got the Oval Office that is the ovaries.
[01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:15.231]  All of this.
[01:34:15.251 --> 01:34:16.632]  We look at the new Apple facility.
[01:34:16.652 --> 01:34:22.898]  So we'll get into the esoteric on this as well and the symbol of one of the big 5G companies, Artemis, and what that means.
[01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:25.100]  And it's a, again, a uterus upside down.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:25.841]  Dr. Group, lay it out.
[01:34:26.266 --> 01:34:34.815]  Well, if you have a document cam right here on Artemis, one of the big 5G companies, Artemis is doing all the improved 5G.
[01:34:34.895 --> 01:34:39.119]  And if you look at the logo of Artemis, it's an inverted ovary.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.523]  I mean, this would be like a woman's reproductive tract.
[01:34:44.224 --> 01:34:50.507]  Yeah, you've got the two ovaries on top and then it goes down into the uterus and then into the vagina, but instead it's inverted like a pentagram.
[01:34:50.527 --> 01:34:53.088]  But oh, you were just saying that, but what does Artemis mean?
[01:34:53.108 --> 01:34:53.608]  Let's go further.
[01:34:53.648 --> 01:35:00.492]  Oh, Artemis is known as the Greek goddess of childbirth and the protectress of the girl child.
[01:35:01.312 --> 01:35:05.254]  So, let's go ahead and make that our logo and knock out fertility with our 5G.
[01:35:05.294 --> 01:35:06.355]  It's a pentagram.
[01:35:06.915 --> 01:35:09.376]  Again, the pentacle is the symbol of the human.
[01:35:09.456 --> 01:35:10.677]  The head, the arms, the legs.
[01:35:10.897 --> 01:35:12.598]  You invert it, it means down with mankind.
[01:35:12.838 --> 01:35:15.280]  The Satanists are down with creation, down with God's creation.
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:24.905]  This is a pentagram, and again, they say, oh, we're named after the goddess of female children, the protector of female children.
[01:35:25.205 --> 01:35:28.687]  They're attacking, and then again, I'm not saying this company even knows it, whoever designed it.
[01:35:28.927 --> 01:35:30.188]  The point is, 5G, they admit,
[01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:32.106]  Annihilates the eggs.
[01:35:45.589 --> 01:35:47.110]  It's a five billion new facility.
[01:35:47.150 --> 01:36:08.407]  This is a schematic of a human egg being fertilized by a sperm node, except down here below you can see the actual real egg, but this is very unique that Apple would be building, considering the fact that they still put their antennas on the back of their iPads or their infertility pads, but Apple is also involved.
[01:36:08.447 --> 01:36:12.870]  Let me tell you what a space and aeronautics professor who's now dead told me 15 years ago.
[01:36:14.131 --> 01:36:16.053]  Who'd leaked me some key info before.
[01:36:16.793 --> 01:36:27.502]  He told me, he said, they're going to build all these campuses and mega sports stadiums that are these round aluminum ovals that look like they are, you know, just high-tech space age design.
[01:36:27.862 --> 01:36:34.127]  But really, they're huge residence broadcasters where they can test on the sports stadium population.
[01:36:34.307 --> 01:36:36.709]  Or, he said, in the future it'll be company headquarters.
[01:36:36.989 --> 01:36:37.450]  This happened.
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:39.091]  Tex Mars knew the same guy.
[01:36:39.131 --> 01:36:40.771]  He was also a space aeronautics professor.
[01:36:41.232 --> 01:36:41.732]  He wrote about it.
[01:36:42.492 --> 01:36:45.594]  And Tex is about to retire.
[01:36:45.614 --> 01:36:46.174]  I should get him on.
[01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:52.478]  But they are actually using these to test as huge laboratories and the employees don't even know it.
[01:36:52.738 --> 01:37:01.202]  Like in Minnesota, they caught him 10 years ago testing data over power line through new light bulbs in police departments in Minnesota.
[01:37:01.542 --> 01:37:03.043]  But they kept having seizures.
[01:37:03.263 --> 01:37:04.364]  This was even in the local news.
[01:37:04.864 --> 01:37:07.805]  So the police are in there, and of course you're testing mind control on the police.
[01:37:08.266 --> 01:37:09.146]  You can't make this up.
[01:37:09.166 --> 01:37:10.066]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:10.547 --> 01:37:11.827]  I said I'm going to shut up.
[01:37:12.027 --> 01:37:12.928]  I'm going to leave the room.
[01:37:12.948 --> 01:37:13.688]  I'm going to leave the room.
[01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:16.069]  I'm not going to be able to stop because I have to back up everything you're saying.
[01:37:16.089 --> 01:37:19.051]  I'm leaving the room for the rest of this segment and the next because I'm just not going to be able to shut up.
[01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:36.502]  By the way, to give credit where credit is due, one of the lead researchers in the country and the world on this is Joe Imbriano, and you can pull up all these images and the backgrounds from his site, which is the FullertonInformer.com, and he's really outspoken.
[01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:40.105]  He's a PhD and he's a scientist on all this stuff and is really
[01:37:41.065 --> 01:37:43.888]  I covered a lot of the information here.
[01:37:44.868 --> 01:37:56.478]  One of the things though that's very interesting is when the FCC opened up to Wi-Fi, when they opened up all of the radio waves to Wi-Fi, they set it at 2.4 gigahertz.
[01:37:57.198 --> 01:38:01.762]  Well 2.4 gigahertz is actually what
[01:38:03.445 --> 01:38:05.867]  Resonates with water.
[01:38:06.467 --> 01:38:14.174]  I mean, it gets deeper and deeper and deeper when you start looking into all of these different little things that are going on here.
[01:38:14.214 --> 01:38:21.019]  The water molecule frequency is 2.4 gigahertz and that's the maximum dielectric loss.
[01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:25.522]  Masao Emoto got into that in the messages of water and he said before he died,
[01:38:26.343 --> 01:38:34.328]  The, what we need to look out for in the future is the harmful effects of radiation because we can't see it and we can't feel it.
[01:38:34.749 --> 01:38:38.491]  And it's the perfect weapon system, the silent weapon for quiet wars.
[01:38:38.931 --> 01:38:43.595]  It's been developed as a weapon system and it's being developed as a weapon system right now.
[01:38:43.635 --> 01:38:46.136]  That's why all the elite are going underground.
[01:38:46.216 --> 01:38:52.821]  All these underground bunkers are protectant against any type of electro frequencies, electromodulation.
[01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:55.843]  It's being developed for crowd dispersion technology.
[01:38:56.483 --> 01:39:03.168]  So the 2.4 gigahertz, think about all living things are composed of at least 80 to 90 percent water.
[01:39:03.569 --> 01:39:12.576]  How are you going to alter the communication between cells when the cells are filled with basically salt water and the human tissues are filled with salt water?
[01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:13.796]  How is that going?
[01:39:13.816 --> 01:39:17.780]  How are you going to communicate or how are you going to break that communication?
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.101]  And you're going to do it through
[01:39:20.476 --> 01:39:32.286]  Getting people excited to hold devices in their hands, put relay stations in their homes, put smart meters on the homes.
[01:39:32.326 --> 01:39:33.146]  You've got to have boosters.
[01:39:33.166 --> 01:39:39.752]  That's in the CIA document because the cell phone tracks you and then it triangulates the other boosters when they want to test the oscillators.
[01:39:39.792 --> 01:39:40.893]  That's all in the CIA document.
[01:39:41.353 --> 01:39:43.535]  And they were doing stuff in the 70s like restless leg.
[01:39:43.815 --> 01:39:47.078]  They said we'll make people flop, make their legs jerk.
[01:39:47.438 --> 01:39:49.259]  That's the kind of stuff that's the popular mechanics.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.061]  You wonder why all that's happening?
[01:39:51.401 --> 01:39:52.101]  God Almighty!
[01:39:52.201 --> 01:39:55.603]  Well, the thing is, people don't even really know that it's happening.
[01:39:55.663 --> 01:40:10.552]  I mean, and people that are suffering from so many different health conditions and symptoms, you know, there's kind of a saying in the natural field, if you're suffering from anything, look at the electromagnetic radiation effects and look at the fungus, mold, and yeast effects.
[01:40:10.592 --> 01:40:18.477]  Those are the things that no doctor out there will test for or evaluate, and there's really not that many ways to evaluate for that to begin with.
[01:40:18.957 --> 01:40:24.162]  What they're coming out with now though is they're coming out with Y-GIG.
[01:40:24.922 --> 01:40:25.783]  Y-GIG.
[01:40:26.343 --> 01:40:31.348]  Y-GIG is a 60 gigahertz millimeter wave.
[01:40:32.489 --> 01:40:36.792]  By the way, same millimeter wave as body scanners in the airports.
[01:40:38.134 --> 01:40:45.000]  Now the interesting thing about this is the Y-GIG at 60 gigahertz
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:53.931]  The molecules that it affects are water, oxygen, CO2, and ozone.
[01:40:54.793 --> 01:40:58.418]  So, with this YGIG being implemented,
[01:40:59.301 --> 01:41:02.562]  You can literally control the atmosphere.
[01:41:02.582 --> 01:41:05.624]  You can control the oxygen in the body.
[01:41:05.684 --> 01:41:06.764]  Now listen to this, Alex.
[01:41:06.884 --> 01:41:17.129]  What if you were able to turn a street light on outside your house, or you had broadcast Y gig inside your home, they can alter that a little bit.
[01:41:17.389 --> 01:41:23.872]  It might be from 45 to 70 gig range, which is probably what they'll say, and they alter that right at 60 gigs.
[01:41:23.892 --> 01:41:26.513]  They can control your oxygen absorption.
[01:41:27.543 --> 01:41:33.167]  They can mess with the electron spin of the water inside your body.
[01:41:33.988 --> 01:41:35.729]  They can alter the CO2.
[01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:41.874]  And they can even prevent ozone, which is actually a cleansing agent, has been used by the Earth.
[01:41:41.894 --> 01:41:43.275]  So they're burning off the atmosphere.
[01:41:44.096 --> 01:41:50.781]  So they can literally, that's all part of becoming a hybrid human-cyborg.
[01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:51.181]  And let's explain.
[01:41:51.201 --> 01:41:52.182]  I know it sounds crazy.
[01:41:52.222 --> 01:41:53.163]  You see the messages?
[01:41:54.023 --> 01:42:05.028]  Consciously, subconsciously, the programming through the phone, then there's the background radiation in their own documents resonating, and that's how they say now they can, with enough of these systems, fully take someone over.
[01:42:06.048 --> 01:42:16.513]  Dr. Alan Frey, one of the scientists at the Office of Naval Research, this is how it all comes together, and this is the scary part.
[01:42:16.553 --> 01:42:21.055]  But don't forget that there's always solutions for every situation.
[01:42:21.075 --> 01:42:23.296]  They know how powerful we are, that's why they're desperate to suppress us.
[01:42:23.536 --> 01:42:33.178]  That's why there's thorn iodine, that's why they're focusing on the DNA, that's why they're focusing the elite on stem cells, because they know that they can culture your own stem cells.
[01:42:33.238 --> 01:42:35.138]  They have ways to mitigate what they're doing to themselves.
[01:42:35.178 --> 01:42:37.319]  And they can mitigate all of this and prevent.
[01:42:37.519 --> 01:42:44.960]  That's why they're also coming out with protective clothing that you can wear now, and the elite actually have the silver woven into their gloves.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.361]  Well let's come back, they admit that the globalists are all into these Faraday cages, they're building bunkers where they sleep.
[01:42:49.921 --> 01:42:54.170]  Because they understand that just natural radiation coming in is what's aging us a lot of it.
[01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:57.777]  So they're now sleeping in lead-blind rooms.
[01:42:57.877 --> 01:42:58.799]  We have to go this ourselves.
[01:42:58.819 --> 01:42:59.521]  I've got to have this.
[01:42:59.902 --> 01:43:00.763]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:02.840]  Alpha Power.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.021]  Here's what you want to know.
[01:43:04.241 --> 01:43:10.226]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:43:10.886 --> 01:43:14.430]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:23.257]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:43:23.798 --> 01:43:27.180]  The average male or female enhancement
[01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:31.384]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:43:31.404 --> 01:43:33.106]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:43:33.466 --> 01:43:38.551]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:43:38.851 --> 01:43:43.815]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product.
[01:43:46.898 --> 01:43:47.158]  In them.
[01:43:47.578 --> 01:43:48.619]  Nobody else does that.
[01:43:48.679 --> 01:43:51.420]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:53.761]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[01:43:54.141 --> 01:43:59.484]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:44:03.539 --> 01:44:04.419]  Hi, I'm Millie Weaver.
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:23.866]  I'm a reporter for InfoWars and the reason I brought this microphone up here to show you guys is there have been so many times that I've been accosted, spit at, had urine thrown on me by rogue people, especially Antifa groups, radical communist leftist groups.
[01:44:24.426 --> 01:44:31.349]  Because of the lies and propaganda that the mainstream media spews about InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:34.010]  So I get attacked because of these lies.
[01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:35.051]  Physically attacked.
[01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:42.814]  Now, a lot of this lawsuit that's been put against Alex Jones and InfoWars surrounds Charlottesville.
[01:44:43.214 --> 01:44:44.855]  I was there in Charlottesville.
[01:44:45.315 --> 01:44:49.757]  I was the InfoWars reporter on the ground reporting to you guys what happened.
[01:44:50.157 --> 01:45:06.861]  We all know that the mainstream media afterward decided to spin a biased, one-sided storyline that you had a bunch of rogue KKK extremists come and attack a bunch of peaceful protesters out there.
[01:45:07.321 --> 01:45:18.744]  What I can tell you is that because I had the ability to livestream and to broadcast on social media, which those broadcasts went viral, I was able to show what exactly
[01:45:19.204 --> 01:45:21.426]  Actually happened out there in Charlottesville.
[01:45:21.747 --> 01:45:35.402]  There was violence on both sides, but I will say the overwhelming majority of the violence was coming from the Antifa leftist anti protesters the ones protesting people
[01:45:35.922 --> 01:45:39.005]  Who were out there trying to stand up for protecting a statue.
[01:45:39.306 --> 01:45:42.148]  And yes, there were rogue elements on both sides.
[01:45:42.509 --> 01:45:52.880]  But one side came with pepper spray, tear gas canisters, ice chests full of water balloons with chemicals and urine and feces in them to throw.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.984]  And that was depicted and caught through my ability.
[01:45:57.284 --> 01:46:04.188]  To live stream, broadcast on Facebook, on YouTube, on these social media sites that they want to remove us from.
[01:46:04.408 --> 01:46:06.650]  I got the truth out there with Charlotte's film.
[01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:14.674]  While at the same time, myself and my cameraman especially were pepper sprayed in the face for being InfoWars.
[01:46:15.054 --> 01:46:20.578]  I made it clear to both Antifa and some of the radical elements on the
[01:46:21.298 --> 01:46:25.781]  Alternative right side that we did not agree with any of their positions.
[01:46:26.022 --> 01:46:29.764]  But what I told them was, I do agree with your right to free speech.
[01:46:30.285 --> 01:46:34.148]  Both of you guys have a right to be out here and peacefully protest.
[01:46:34.528 --> 01:46:42.113]  That didn't stop us from being pepper sprayed and attacked because of the lies and the propaganda that the mainstream media spreads about us and InfoWars.
[01:46:42.474 --> 01:46:48.038]  That's why it's so important that we protect free press, guerrilla journalists,
[01:46:48.698 --> 01:47:00.884]  All of us out here today who are in this room should understand and know the importance of our ability to go out there and tell the truth when sometimes the moral integrity of mainstream media is lapsed.
[01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:08.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:15.792]  We shall go on to the end.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:18.381]  We shall fight in France.
[01:47:19.402 --> 01:47:21.524]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[01:47:22.584 --> 01:47:27.028]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[01:47:28.509 --> 01:47:31.752]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[01:47:31.772 --> 01:47:33.993]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[01:47:34.774 --> 01:47:36.655]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[01:47:37.516 --> 01:47:40.578]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[01:47:41.159 --> 01:47:42.660]  We shall fight in the hills.
[01:47:43.601 --> 01:47:44.882]  We shall never surrender!
[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:53.315]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:53.335 --> 01:47:55.858]  That's right, and I got four children.
[01:47:55.898 --> 01:47:56.498]  This is real.
[01:47:56.579 --> 01:47:57.099]  I'm upset.
[01:47:57.139 --> 01:47:59.521]  I'm jumping in a lot, backing up what Groot was saying during the break.
[01:47:59.541 --> 01:48:01.483]  He's like, no, I'm glad you are, because it adds all the other points.
[01:48:01.523 --> 01:48:07.169]  But you're going to be back on with Owen Schroer today in the last hour to really be able to lay out even more.
[01:48:07.209 --> 01:48:08.890]  I want to get you back next week on this.
[01:48:09.331 --> 01:48:10.332]  We have got to hammer this.
[01:48:10.352 --> 01:48:11.433]  I want you to go around with a
[01:48:13.046 --> 01:48:25.929]  It's basically a little booklet I'm going to put out, a little file with studies, mainstream headlines, and I want to go and knock on doors and knock on schools and say, hey, you got a cell tower on top here, just to get people out of the comfort zone that this is serious.
[01:48:26.429 --> 01:48:30.730]  I mean, if people were smoking five packs of cigarettes with your kids every day in school, you'd want to know.
[01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:33.850]  Well, they have major studies saying this is more deadly than cigarette smoke.
[01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:38.791]  This is serious business, folks, and it's planned, and it's hurting the environment, not just humans.
[01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:40.552]  A lot of leftists want humans to die.
[01:48:41.232 --> 01:48:45.156]  Planned Parenthood's come out and said that, you know, the heartbeat is an arbitrary standard of life.
[01:48:45.456 --> 01:48:47.758]  Kill the baby, because then they were never alive.
[01:48:48.179 --> 01:48:50.401]  This is mind control, but roll through this.
[01:48:50.501 --> 01:48:52.043]  Mind control, population control.
[01:48:52.083 --> 01:48:52.583]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:48:52.663 --> 01:48:53.804]  I mean, feel free to interrupt.
[01:48:53.904 --> 01:48:54.905]  I don't want you to.
[01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:55.886]  Last ten minutes.
[01:48:56.287 --> 01:48:57.067]  And talk about things.
[01:48:57.087 --> 01:48:58.068]  You had some good points there.
[01:48:58.749 --> 01:49:01.472]  But one of the things is piecing everything together.
[01:49:02.292 --> 01:49:11.319]  And one of the things I found, and we'll publish all this stuff too, is that Dr. Frey with the Office of Naval Research, he injected rats with methylene blue.
[01:49:11.419 --> 01:49:15.902]  And methylene blue, so under different types of imaging technologies, you can see where it goes.
[01:49:15.942 --> 01:49:17.924]  They use it to find out.
[01:49:17.964 --> 01:49:21.206]  And none of the blue crossed the blood-brain barrier.
[01:49:22.046 --> 01:49:22.407]  And so,
[01:49:23.965 --> 01:49:37.781]  When he exposed the rats to pulsed EMF frequencies, even low range in the cellular range, all of a sudden the methylene blue went into the brains of the rats.
[01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:39.382]  Now what does that tell you?
[01:49:39.503 --> 01:49:41.365]  What's the grand scheme of things?
[01:49:41.405 --> 01:49:42.706]  What's really going on here?
[01:49:43.848 --> 01:49:59.525]  That means that you can transport metals, transport nanoparticles into the brain by using EMF frequencies, by using cell phone towers, by using routers, by using cell phones, and not only that,
[01:50:00.453 --> 01:50:06.116]  It also increases the permeability of the intestinal lining as well.
[01:50:06.876 --> 01:50:16.681]  So when you look at all of the chemicals that are being put in the food supply, the metals, you look at why are they spraying us with chemtrails.
[01:50:17.341 --> 01:50:19.703]  You have nanoparticles of aluminum.
[01:50:19.763 --> 01:50:21.744]  You can pull that up for the geoengineering.
[01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:24.025]  All of these different components
[01:50:24.645 --> 01:50:34.052]  We now know how the EMF component is put into this whole picture because now we can open up, they can open up the brain.
[01:50:34.073 --> 01:50:44.261]  This, you know, basically bring any type of nanoparticles, metal or whatever they want, into the brain.
[01:50:45.256 --> 01:50:55.683]  Which can be controlled now with EMF frequencies and with the rollout of 5G and the rollout of all these Y gig, etc.
[01:50:56.083 --> 01:51:03.088]  Not only that, they can now target the oxygen, they can now target the water, they can now target the carbon dioxide.
[01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:07.191]  Now, not only that, but you have birds that are dying off everywhere.
[01:51:07.371 --> 01:51:10.033]  You have insects that are dying off everywhere.
[01:51:10.233 --> 01:51:12.195]  You have trees that are being affected.
[01:51:13.035 --> 01:51:15.059]  By the electromagnetic frequencies.
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.307]  Because of the, you have agenda 21, so now you can see the whole picture.
[01:51:20.008 --> 01:51:21.651]  If we take it even further to...
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:39.587]  The fluoride in the water, which was at the end of the Second World War, when the government sent Charles Elliot Perkins, who is a research worker in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology, to take charge of the Farben chemical plants in Germany.
[01:51:39.627 --> 01:51:43.389]  That's IG Farben, if you go on and you look at the history between IG Farben.
[01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:58.487]  He was told the chemists had a scheme which would be worked out by the war and the German general staff, and that was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water.
[01:51:59.348 --> 01:52:02.971]  In this scheme, sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place.
[01:52:03.871 --> 01:52:12.738]  Now, Perkins has came out later and said, repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will, in time,
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:30.512]  Reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcolizing a certain area of the brain that will then make them submissive to the will of those who wish to govern them.
[01:52:30.612 --> 01:52:36.796]  Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.
[01:52:38.692 --> 01:52:53.998]  What the adding of the fluoride component has to do with this whole EMF thing is it's all about being able to transmit frequencies through the pineal gland and to be able to turn off, turn on your immune system.
[01:52:54.379 --> 01:53:00.161]  If you look at what the pineal gland does, there's actually a crystal in everybody's pineal gland.
[01:53:01.061 --> 01:53:04.703]  I mean that's been proven and you can, through autopsies of people, they can
[01:53:06.358 --> 01:53:08.359]  Determine your spirituality level.
[01:53:08.579 --> 01:53:16.761]  They dissected pineal glands of monks and they found bigger crystals in the pineal glands of monks than they do normal individuals.
[01:53:17.381 --> 01:53:35.146]  So by increasing the halogens, the bromine, the chlorines, the fluorides, into the water supply, into the food supply, it creates a calcification of the pineal gland and it alters the pineal gland so the pineal gland doesn't function and operate effectively.
[01:53:36.226 --> 01:53:37.267]  Well, guess what?
[01:53:37.327 --> 01:53:41.550]  The pineal gland also produces melatonin.
[01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:49.916]  And melatonin is used to help with your gene sequences, to help repair the DNA in your body.
[01:53:50.276 --> 01:54:01.064]  So if you look at all of these things and what the general scheme of things is, the insiders that we've talked about, and Alex has talked about this many times, is what is the grand endgame?
[01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:02.825]  Or what is it that they're going to do?
[01:54:02.865 --> 01:54:03.986]  What is this disease X?
[01:54:04.026 --> 01:54:05.567]  What is this biological warfare?
[01:54:06.147 --> 01:54:29.216]  With the introduction of the 5G and everything that's going on, the calcification of the pineal gland, the lack of production of the melatonin so you can repair your genes, all of that is leading to what I think, and controlling the oxygen, is it's going to be very easy to introduce and control a biological weapon
[01:54:30.632 --> 01:54:36.537]  And then be able to force vaccinate the whole population.
[01:54:36.998 --> 01:54:46.707]  Now the forced vaccination, in my opinion and in my theory, is going to contain the nanoparticles, the chips, the bioactivators.
[01:54:46.727 --> 01:54:48.468]  The final binary weapon.
[01:54:48.488 --> 01:54:56.856]  They will be able to then go cross the blood-brain barrier because we know the electromagnetic frequencies now because of that study with the methylene blue.
[01:54:57.696 --> 01:55:01.398]  Opened up the blood-brain barrier and made the gut lining permeable.
[01:55:01.958 --> 01:55:15.085]  So, if you're able to inject a vaccination, whether it's, you know, forced vaccinations, they might even put it in food, who knows how it's going to go down, but there's got to be a method.
[01:55:15.525 --> 01:55:17.466]  They're already doing it with the nanoparticles.
[01:55:17.767 --> 01:55:18.527]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:55:18.547 --> 01:55:20.428]  They admit it's massively causing cancer.
[01:55:20.688 --> 01:55:22.869]  They admit they're using it to influence our minds.
[01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:24.450]  They admit they're watching us.
[01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:25.731]  They admit it's all illegal.
[01:55:26.491 --> 01:55:27.732]  They're telling us they're doing it.
[01:55:27.812 --> 01:55:28.673]  Why are they telling us?
[01:55:31.335 --> 01:55:40.763]  They have to, because it works off of the negative power with the elite that are the Satan worshippers and everything.
[01:55:40.783 --> 01:55:41.844]  It's a giant sacrifice.
[01:55:41.864 --> 01:55:46.247]  Because of the karmic debt ratio thing that they have going on,
[01:55:47.128 --> 01:55:52.833]  They, in order, if they tell people what they're doing, they're not necessarily responsible for the economic debt.
[01:55:52.873 --> 01:55:53.733]  And they say that esoterically.
[01:55:53.954 --> 01:55:54.954]  So they have to have huge sympathy.
[01:55:54.974 --> 01:55:56.356]  The media will say, we believe this.
[01:55:56.956 --> 01:55:57.537]  It's what they believe.
[01:55:57.557 --> 01:55:58.858]  I've got to do five more minutes with you.
[01:55:59.178 --> 01:56:00.799]  I'm good to just have Veritas on for one segment.
[01:56:00.819 --> 01:56:01.139]  It's fine.
[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.280]  Their stuff's important.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.942]  But I, I, I, I, and I'll keep you fixed a few minutes to get on anyway.
[01:56:04.983 --> 01:56:07.765]  So we'll get him on at five after you get him lined on.
[01:56:08.385 --> 01:56:08.906]  And we'll get him.
[01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:15.376]  This gets me so upset because I'm looking at all the news articles, I have the studies, I've talked to the globalists, I know the plan.
[01:56:16.157 --> 01:56:27.789]  The name of this big 5G company is the goddess of baby girls, and it's a uterus upside down, and we know that this fries eggs, it fries sperm particularly, because it rubs the molecules together.
[01:56:27.829 --> 01:56:28.589]  It's a microwave.
[01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:29.610]  It heats them up.
[01:56:30.211 --> 01:56:31.492]  And it does it to the atmosphere.
[01:56:31.992 --> 01:56:35.155]  And you can see everything they say they're trying to stop, they're trying to do.
[01:56:35.735 --> 01:56:37.056]  And the environmentalists don't care.
[01:56:37.096 --> 01:56:38.017]  They just hate humans.
[01:56:38.637 --> 01:56:40.298]  But this whole thing's killing everybody.
[01:56:40.719 --> 01:56:42.460]  And it's like, it's not even human.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.441]  Well, it's a fallen angel.
[01:56:43.521 --> 01:56:44.061]  It's the devil.
[01:56:44.241 --> 01:56:45.122]  It's the only thing that makes sense.
[01:56:45.182 --> 01:56:47.564]  This is an anti-human, exterminist agenda.
[01:56:47.864 --> 01:56:54.008]  And it's told its minions, the humans that have sold out to it, you'll live forever, but you're going to give up your body and merge with a machine.
[01:56:54.108 --> 01:56:54.829]  I mean, come on!
[01:56:55.089 --> 01:57:00.153]  That con game is so obviously ridiculous, and we got told 2,000 years ago this was coming.
[01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:01.393]  By the good guys.
[01:57:01.894 --> 01:57:05.096]  And I cannot believe we're gonna sit here and put up with this crap.
[01:57:05.997 --> 01:57:06.957]  Everybody's in this trance.
[01:57:07.198 --> 01:57:07.518]  Briefly.
[01:57:09.747 --> 01:57:13.490]  Water, not having Wi-Fi, and we even have low power, and we're getting it out of here, okay?
[01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:17.234]  I even have at my house wires everywhere, and then no one uses the Wi-Fi from outside.
[01:57:17.274 --> 01:57:18.114]  We're getting rid of all of it.
[01:57:18.435 --> 01:57:19.395]  We've got to get serious.
[01:57:20.316 --> 01:57:22.578]  DNA force is great for overall mitochondrial health.
[01:57:22.919 --> 01:57:24.760]  You were saying iodine, we haven't even got into that.
[01:57:25.481 --> 01:57:30.485]  That missing link of the good, the studies on that, why they don't want us to have that, why they took it out of the salt.
[01:57:30.785 --> 01:57:33.207]  We'll do a few more minutes on this, and then Project Veritas.
[01:57:33.988 --> 01:57:39.375]  James O'Keefe giving us a big breakdown of this amazing video dealing with the whole education system.
[01:57:39.695 --> 01:57:42.879]  That's coming up back in two minutes with the conclusion of Dr. Groom.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:47.225]  And then he'll be on in the third hour of the War Room tonight.
[01:57:47.605 --> 01:57:48.947]  So be sure and tune into that.
[01:57:49.167 --> 01:57:50.109]  He'll tell you even more.
[01:57:55.543 --> 01:57:57.404]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[01:57:57.424 --> 01:57:57.705]  Go ahead.
[01:57:57.825 --> 01:58:01.668]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:58:01.848 --> 01:58:06.852]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:58:07.412 --> 01:58:12.736]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:58:13.797 --> 01:58:22.063]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:58:22.744 --> 01:58:25.626]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:58:26.307 --> 01:58:29.909]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:58:30.029 --> 01:58:36.855]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:58:37.515 --> 01:58:41.658]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:58:42.059 --> 01:58:45.362]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:58:46.042 --> 01:58:50.306]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:58:50.826 --> 01:58:56.391]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well at water.
[01:58:56.471 --> 01:59:00.994]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:59:01.855 --> 01:59:03.137]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:59:03.337 --> 01:59:08.664]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:59:08.684 --> 01:59:10.005]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:59:10.045 --> 01:59:10.226]  Yeah.
[01:59:10.366 --> 01:59:12.248]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:59:12.288 --> 01:59:13.109]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:14.831]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:59:14.851 --> 01:59:15.833]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:15.893 --> 01:59:16.894]  Keep up the fight.
[01:59:16.914 --> 01:59:18.015]  We need to take California back.
[01:59:18.055 --> 01:59:18.536]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:59:18.576 --> 01:59:19.838]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:59:19.878 --> 01:59:20.478]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:59:27.927 --> 01:59:30.008]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[01:59:30.509 --> 01:59:38.655]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[01:59:39.015 --> 01:59:41.577]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[01:59:41.977 --> 01:59:45.480]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.881]  We need your help.
[01:59:56.653 --> 02:00:09.476]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:09.516 --> 02:00:13.077]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:00:13.617 --> 02:00:15.598]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.917 --> 02:00:20.921]  Notice the media doesn't want to attack us on this issue because they all know it's true.
[02:00:20.941 --> 02:00:27.771]  And we were talking about how these big high-rise buildings are just these giant antennas with all the Wi-Fi, all the 4G, 3G, 5G.
[02:00:28.231 --> 02:00:29.132]  It's just insane.
[02:00:30.054 --> 02:00:32.958]  And when I lived in a high-rise during my divorce year and a half, I couldn't sleep.
[02:00:32.978 --> 02:00:33.478]  It was terrible.
[02:00:34.439 --> 02:00:38.160]  Now you're out in the country or Big Bend, you feel so good, you can think so good.
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:40.501]  All the studies show these manipulate brainwaves.
[02:00:40.901 --> 02:00:44.602]  Even if they're not trying to manipulate our brainwaves, it's causing major, major problems.
[02:00:44.622 --> 02:00:46.262]  We're going to break here in a few minutes and bring it in.
[02:00:46.482 --> 02:00:50.123]  Project Veritas with James O'Keefe with huge breaking news.
[02:00:50.143 --> 02:00:55.584]  But just finishing up, here is Wired Magazine admitting that it's giving people brain cancer.
[02:00:56.604 --> 02:00:58.025]  I mean, it's all here.
[02:00:58.765 --> 02:01:00.525]  5G smartphones cause brain cancer.
[02:01:00.925 --> 02:01:02.566]  Big Wireless doesn't want you to know.
[02:01:04.093 --> 02:01:04.974]  And you pull back from this.
[02:01:04.994 --> 02:01:08.898]  This is why I'm not scared of George Soros or Hillary suing us or going after James O'Keefe or anybody.
[02:01:08.938 --> 02:01:10.039]  Because we're in a total war.
[02:01:10.059 --> 02:01:15.404]  Either these corporations know what they're doing or they're totally insane because they've always known this.
[02:01:15.704 --> 02:01:16.665]  They're upping the power.
[02:01:16.685 --> 02:01:21.090]  And you were making some great points just to finish up what you were saying, Dr. Group.
[02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:26.535]  Well, I was saying that Bill Clinton's the one that signed the Telecom Act and Obama just signed the Brain Initiative.
[02:01:27.075 --> 02:01:56.501]  Project a couple years ago so they know what's going on and it's already look look at society today and you know you talk about population control the men are infertile and the women are infertile now just because of all of these things that are happening the electromagnetic frequencies harden the eggs inside of the female and the fluoride and all the endocrine disrupting chemicals that are feminizing all the males are ruining the sperm and
[02:01:56.561 --> 02:01:57.701]  We have mainstream articles.
[02:01:58.382 --> 02:01:59.882]  What happens to an egg that gets cooked?
[02:01:59.982 --> 02:02:00.783]  It gets hard-boiled.
[02:02:01.203 --> 02:02:01.963]  They're cooked!
[02:02:02.383 --> 02:02:03.584]  The eggs are literally cooked.
[02:02:03.644 --> 02:02:07.965]  I mean, young girls now, they're finding that their eggs are just all cooked together.
[02:02:08.006 --> 02:02:08.706]  They're just hard.
[02:02:09.046 --> 02:02:09.966]  So what does that mean?
[02:02:10.046 --> 02:02:16.589]  If the women don't have any viable eggs and the men don't have any viable sperm, you've already accomplished population control.
[02:02:16.969 --> 02:02:21.651]  The way they want to control it is, now, how do you fertilize a hardened egg?
[02:02:21.991 --> 02:02:23.832]  You have to do it through IVF.
[02:02:24.133 --> 02:02:30.656]  You have to get a male sperm and you have to inject the needle through that hardened layer and you have to inject sperm into it.
[02:02:30.696 --> 02:02:32.437]  So it takes control of the whole reproductive process.
[02:02:32.457 --> 02:02:34.898]  They can control the whole reproductive
[02:02:35.758 --> 02:02:36.439]  We're good to go.
[02:02:54.090 --> 02:03:07.381]  Listen, they already have technology right now that DARPA's been working on where they can read your thoughts and their plan is to come arrest you when you think about robbing the store two hours ago.
[02:03:07.441 --> 02:03:09.363]  That was in the Associated Press a month ago.
[02:03:09.703 --> 02:03:11.444]  Listeners didn't believe it when I read it.
[02:03:11.805 --> 02:03:14.687]  Yes, I have evidence of that in this documentation.
[02:03:14.747 --> 02:03:21.653]  Yes, as crime prevention, and they can punish you for thinking about
[02:03:22.728 --> 02:03:24.109]  Creating a crime.
[02:03:24.269 --> 02:03:26.331]  And they just claim that they know.
[02:03:26.351 --> 02:03:35.319]  And they want to merge your thought patterns with this cyborg type of, you know, these brain implants so that you become this half-human transhumanism.
[02:03:35.419 --> 02:03:37.821]  You've been talking about transhumanism for like 15 years.
[02:03:37.861 --> 02:03:40.403]  Well this is thousands of times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[02:03:40.683 --> 02:03:57.317]  And if you read what the transhumanist Julian Huxley said, Olaus Huxley's brother, in the 60s, he said, we're going to start with trans men to women, women to men, we're going to make it illegal to criticize it, and then all these hybrids, all these clones, all these cross-species, it'll be the law, you can't even talk about it.
[02:03:57.677 --> 02:04:08.986]  The good news is iodine, selenium, vitamin D, DNA force, anything that protects your DNA is being shown right now to be able to protect you from
[02:04:10.307 --> 02:04:16.372]  5G, electromagnetic, of course you want to address the root cause of it and just, you know, try to, let's just try to fight it and let's get the word out.
[02:04:16.412 --> 02:04:18.513]  Studies show if you're more healthy it mitigates it a lot.
[02:04:18.593 --> 02:04:26.899]  But, as long as you have the necessary ingredients and the good products to protect yourself, keep your body clean, there is a solution.
[02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:36.986]  Obviously, that's the solution that we have now to protect yourself and that's, you know, we've taken people through cleansing processes and repaired their DNA and they're able to actually have healthy, good children.
[02:04:37.026 --> 02:04:39.048]  But, especially for the parents out there,
[02:04:40.089 --> 02:04:46.735]  Be aware, there's blankets, there's clothing now, EMF-proof clothing, there's hats you can wear, there's bed things you can put over, there's paint.
[02:04:46.795 --> 02:04:50.119]  Well, people put their cell phone in the bag so that it can't be tracked of where you go.
[02:04:50.139 --> 02:04:50.939]  That's weird.
[02:04:50.959 --> 02:04:56.024]  They have embedded propaganda in shows, you know, like Better Call Saul or His Brother's Crazy and things like that.
[02:04:56.044 --> 02:04:59.668]  But you have all the documents, all the UN documents, the Associated Press right here.
[02:04:59.888 --> 02:05:01.049]  It's double brain tumors, folks.
[02:05:01.269 --> 02:05:02.130]  James O'Keefe coming up.
[02:05:02.150 --> 02:05:02.851]  Thanks a lot, Dr. Group.
[02:05:03.491 --> 02:05:10.317]  I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration.
[02:05:10.637 --> 02:05:15.661]  Texas and six other states are suing the Trump administration over its failure to end DACA.
[02:05:15.881 --> 02:05:29.993]  Adan Salazar reports that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the multi-state lawsuit, which was filed in federal court Tuesday, and seeks to put an end to the unconstitutional immigration program, which protects many illegals from deportation.
[02:05:30.313 --> 02:05:37.857]  Paxton said the multi-state coalition lawsuit is about the rule of law, not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy.
[02:05:38.238 --> 02:05:43.861]  The suit faults activist judges for preventing the Trump administration from phasing out DACA as promised.
[02:05:44.341 --> 02:05:54.547]  According to Paxton, this means that unelected federal judges are forcing the Trump administration to leave an unlawful program in place indefinitely as legal challenges drag on.
[02:05:54.827 --> 02:05:57.769]  Adding, President Trump has a duty under the Constitution
[02:05:58.109 --> 02:06:00.612]  To take care that the law be faithfully executed.
[02:06:00.932 --> 02:06:02.654]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[02:06:15.802 --> 02:06:17.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:18.426 --> 02:06:20.068]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.351 --> 02:06:26.917]  Well, the one, the only James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is just here with us for two segments.
[02:06:27.558 --> 02:06:32.064]  He's got a major new coup exposing these wild Department of Education
[02:06:32.705 --> 02:06:34.606]  Well Alex, thanks for having me on again.
[02:06:34.646 --> 02:06:35.106]  This is a pretty
[02:06:57.954 --> 02:07:02.637]  Shocking expose or it confirms suspicions about leadership in education.
[02:07:02.657 --> 02:07:07.180]  What you're about to see are two presidents of the teachers union.
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.982]  One guy named Dave Perry in Trenton, New Jersey.
[02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:13.344]  Another named Kathleen Valencia in Union City, New Jersey.
[02:07:13.364 --> 02:07:17.467]  And they're talking about covering up child abusers in the public schools.
[02:07:18.167 --> 02:07:20.769]  Dave Perry, the statements he makes are so shocking.
[02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:24.453]  He actually says, we want to turn it back around onto the child.
[02:07:24.473 --> 02:07:25.553]  He says, it's my job.
[02:07:26.094 --> 02:07:27.655]  He says, I'm gonna backdate it.
[02:07:27.715 --> 02:07:30.518]  That's commit fraud after the incident of abuse.
[02:07:30.958 --> 02:07:32.960]  He says, that's his job at the teachers union.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.041]  He's there to protect the worst people.
[02:07:35.522 --> 02:07:38.884]  He's there to bend the truth, and he's there to reverse it back onto the kid.
[02:07:38.905 --> 02:07:42.908]  There's me confronting Dave Perry, who denied the things he said.
[02:07:42.948 --> 02:07:44.009]  Now, last night, Alex,
[02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:51.559]  The National Education Association and the NJEA, that's the New Jersey version of it, has suspended him.
[02:07:51.639 --> 02:08:00.132]  So they've suspended one union president and then just today, Alex, we released another woman in New Jersey saying that she was protecting child abuse.
[02:08:01.175 --> 02:08:01.375]  I think
[02:08:21.084 --> 02:08:25.145]  What you've done for the Republic, they're definitely coming after you, death-threatening you, you know, you name it.
[02:08:25.665 --> 02:08:38.949]  It's just incredible that time after time, whether you caught YouTube saying their number one job is to ban Infowars or any of this, is that they're so brazen, they act like classical villains out of an old black and white movie or like a cartoon.
[02:08:40.168 --> 02:08:42.771]  Yeah, Alex, I think there's three stages of the truth.
[02:08:42.831 --> 02:08:45.494]  The first is to ridicule the messenger.
[02:08:45.614 --> 02:08:48.618]  The second is to viciously attack the messenger.
[02:08:48.678 --> 02:08:51.521]  And the third is that the truth becomes self-evident.
[02:08:52.182 --> 02:08:56.003]  And the arc of the moral universe is long, but it sure bends.
[02:08:56.543 --> 02:09:03.664]  These tapes are so... I mean, it is... You couldn't write a caricature of a union boss mobster.
[02:09:03.704 --> 02:09:07.085]  If you look at the video, these guys are saying things that you couldn't script.
[02:09:07.105 --> 02:09:19.547]  I mean, it's... The woman today, Valencia was her name, she says that there's this guy who had sex with a teenage girl, and they're going to cover it up and no one's going to jail, and she waves the documents in front of the camera,
[02:09:20.067 --> 02:09:30.652]  So the good news is, Alex, even the mainstream media in New York and New Jersey, this is kind of a statewide story over the last 24 hours, even them have not been able to defend what you're seeing on tape.
[02:09:30.672 --> 02:09:35.854]  But because these union officials have never been asked a difficult question in their lives, they've never been held accountable,
[02:09:36.494 --> 02:09:40.195]  It's like very low-hanging fruit, and we have a lot more to come.
[02:09:40.575 --> 02:09:43.976]  We're going to play the individual from Illinois first, and we're going to go to break.
[02:09:44.036 --> 02:09:45.397]  You'll do a few more minutes, and you're going to leave us.
[02:09:45.457 --> 02:09:47.837]  I'll play the lady that you just exposed.
[02:09:47.857 --> 02:09:49.098]  We'll talk more about that in the next segment.
[02:09:49.118 --> 02:09:50.918]  But again, this is the individual.
[02:09:51.498 --> 02:09:55.900]  This is the Teachers Union head in a major township of Illinois, correct?
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:59.661]  This is in Hamilton Township, which is near Trenton, New Jersey.
[02:09:59.681 --> 02:10:00.241]  No, New Jersey.
[02:10:00.876 --> 02:10:02.898]  He's the president of his chapter.
[02:10:03.258 --> 02:10:06.201]  He's a leader, he has a PhD, he's a doctor, and watch what he says.
[02:10:06.461 --> 02:10:07.122]  Okay, here it is.
[02:10:07.903 --> 02:10:12.807]  Dr. Perry, how do you justify having a job where you protect teachers?
[02:10:12.967 --> 02:10:15.049]  You're on hidden camera, sir.
[02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:20.654]  You're on hidden camera talking about protecting teachers who abuse students.
[02:10:21.815 --> 02:10:24.438]  Okay, Dr. Perry locked the door, we cannot get in.
[02:10:24.458 --> 02:10:24.498]  Hi.
[02:10:26.636 --> 02:10:28.297]  First of all, I'm not going to be rude to you.
[02:10:28.317 --> 02:10:29.498]  So I'm not going to be rude.
[02:10:29.718 --> 02:10:31.399]  And I'm not justifying anything.
[02:10:32.319 --> 02:10:36.362]  I just wanted to come out here and say hello to you and not be rude to you.
[02:10:37.402 --> 02:10:41.805]  And do you know the video of yourself talking to the person who said... We already knew that person.
[02:10:42.265 --> 02:10:44.106]  We knew they were coming in because they came in the next day.
[02:10:44.446 --> 02:10:47.007]  So you said that you protected a teacher who had shoplifted?
[02:10:47.627 --> 02:10:47.747]  No.
[02:10:47.787 --> 02:10:49.147]  Would you like to see yourself on video?
[02:10:49.187 --> 02:10:49.407]  No.
[02:10:49.627 --> 02:10:51.728]  I said what we do is we help people.
[02:10:52.328 --> 02:10:52.948]  We help people.
[02:10:53.388 --> 02:10:55.609]  And what they do wrong, they deserve the punishment.
[02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:56.769]  What did you mean by bend the truth?
[02:10:56.789 --> 02:10:58.149]  Okay.
[02:10:58.569 --> 02:10:59.970]  So we just talked to David Perry.
[02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:03.530]  We're outside the Hamilton Township Education Association in New Jersey.
[02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:06.711]  He denied saying what he said, but we have the tape.
[02:11:07.211 --> 02:11:08.792]  But I don't want him coming here with a bunch of lies.
[02:11:08.832 --> 02:11:10.572]  I need to know the truth so that we can
[02:11:13.499 --> 02:11:16.202]  Yeah, I mean it was like a physical... Yeah, like a physical skirmish.
[02:11:16.242 --> 02:11:16.362]  Okay.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:38.842]  Mm-hmm.
[02:11:46.334 --> 02:11:47.454]  Okay, yeah.
[02:11:47.775 --> 02:11:48.295]  That's my job.
[02:11:48.475 --> 02:11:51.216]  It's not a good job, but it's my job and what I have to do.
[02:11:51.276 --> 02:11:52.176]  It's his job.
[02:11:52.576 --> 02:11:57.538]  It's his job to protect teachers who abuse students.
[02:11:57.958 --> 02:12:00.179]  He says he wants to bend the truth.
[02:12:00.799 --> 02:12:02.480]  He said it's what he does all the time.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.021]  So we have the tape.
[02:12:04.061 --> 02:12:08.162]  He's going to deny it, but the NJEA is in a bunch of hot water today.
[02:12:08.622 --> 02:12:12.604]  And let me tell you something, there is more coming and it gets worse.
[02:12:13.735 --> 02:12:17.236]  You know, what gets to me, James, is it's like every one of your videos is like this.
[02:12:17.276 --> 02:12:18.737]  They rub their hands together.
[02:12:18.917 --> 02:12:22.178]  If I saw a Netflix show about, like you said, the Gottis.
[02:12:22.299 --> 02:12:24.599]  I've seen footage of the Gottis.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.600]  They didn't act this crazed.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.841]  I mean, what is it?
[02:12:27.901 --> 02:12:29.602]  What has the Democratic Party turned into?
[02:12:29.622 --> 02:12:32.903]  It's like every one of your videos is like next level.
[02:12:34.096 --> 02:12:36.877]  Yeah, you couldn't write a Netflix series.
[02:12:36.917 --> 02:12:39.298]  You couldn't cast the person to play the role.
[02:12:39.798 --> 02:12:43.620]  But the reason why that is, Alex, is these people have never been asked a difficult question in their lives.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:44.900]  There's no transparency.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:46.321]  There's no accountability.
[02:12:46.781 --> 02:12:49.722]  Breitbart called it the Abu Grave of the Great Society.
[02:12:49.762 --> 02:12:51.483]  That is to say, there's just no
[02:12:52.881 --> 02:12:53.622]  Transparency.
[02:12:53.782 --> 02:13:10.653]  So, you know, you have someone like us come along, we walk in there, we spend an hour talking to the guy, sorry, half an hour talking to the guy, and it's just one damning quote after they're revealing their soul to us, and I think the most disgusting thing is that, so you hit the kid, you hit the kid, so what?
[02:13:11.133 --> 02:13:13.816]  My job is to only defend the worst of the worst.
[02:13:14.216 --> 02:13:20.783]  So it's the arrogance, it's the lack of introspection, it's the lack of even self-analysis.
[02:13:20.803 --> 02:13:25.367]  What he says, I'm going to reverse it onto the kid, well that's what they do everything.
[02:13:26.168 --> 02:13:28.050]  The Democrats invert everything.
[02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:28.971]  That's their religion.
[02:13:29.251 --> 02:13:30.152]  They're not very creative.
[02:13:30.192 --> 02:13:32.354]  They just invert, invert, invert.
[02:13:33.328 --> 02:13:35.910]  Yes, and the truth is so powerful here, Alex.
[02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:44.516]  Even the local Trenton newspaper, the Jersey papers, the New York papers today are saying, well, even O'Keefe is a broken clock who's right twice a day.
[02:13:44.856 --> 02:13:48.899]  So they can't come up with a reason to criticize this.
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:52.442]  Now, Alex, the teachers union has suspended
[02:13:52.942 --> 02:13:56.625]  This president, they've suspended him, and now there's a new tape out.
[02:13:56.645 --> 02:14:02.770]  I don't know if you have it queued up, but this is Kathleen Valencia, the president of Union City, who is... Oh, there you go.
[02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:04.231]  See, this is unbelievable.
[02:14:04.592 --> 02:14:12.058]  She actually talks about a real incident where a teacher had sex with a teenager, and that they're not allowing him to go to jail, they're protecting their pension!
[02:14:13.346 --> 02:14:31.018]  You gotta listen to this one because this is an actual teacher who's out there and we couldn't get the person's name because we weren't able to read the document but a lot of people are outraged about this Alex and it's starting to... Well let's be clear, I mean that's what colleges and primary schools have turned into places.
[02:14:31.918 --> 02:14:45.542]  For predators to do what they want, whether it's beat kids up, have sex with them, and then we try to talk about it, they'll use my investigations or other people's investigations, where we weren't 100% on, to then say, oh, there's no such thing as pedophilia, period, or any of this.
[02:14:45.582 --> 02:14:49.883]  But ProjectVeritas.com, we just posted to Infowars.com a new tape.
[02:14:49.923 --> 02:14:50.903]  I thought that was just this one.
[02:14:51.143 --> 02:14:52.124]  God, he says there's more coming.
[02:14:52.424 --> 02:15:00.226]  Hidden camera, Union President, New Jersey, admits to protecting, quote, teacher who had sex with teenage girl, willing to cover up abuse of scumbag student.
[02:15:00.686 --> 02:15:03.269]  So let's just roll that tape from the start.
[02:15:03.289 --> 02:15:04.330]  You know, we're going to go to break.
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:05.751]  We're going to come back and let O'Keefe finish up.
[02:15:05.771 --> 02:15:07.213]  Then I'm going to play like five minutes of it.
[02:15:07.673 --> 02:15:09.095]  We got 55 seconds to break.
[02:15:09.395 --> 02:15:10.556]  You say more is coming.
[02:15:10.616 --> 02:15:10.936]  Wow!
[02:15:10.976 --> 02:15:11.897]  I mean, give us an idea.
[02:15:12.638 --> 02:15:15.821]  Yeah, Alex, this is an unprecedented investigation.
[02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:16.862]  Veritas has grown.
[02:15:16.902 --> 02:15:18.464]  We've heard it before.
[02:15:18.504 --> 02:15:18.764]  Thanks.
[02:15:19.065 --> 02:15:19.505]  Much to you.
[02:15:21.232 --> 02:15:26.456]  Hold on, your Skype's breaking up, so let's just go to break and come back and let you start back over, because it was unintelligible there.
[02:15:27.016 --> 02:15:29.198]  We'll come right back in five more minutes with James O'Keefe.
[02:15:29.238 --> 02:15:36.523]  I'm going to play five minutes of the 30-something minute tape he's got, and it's just mind-blowing that
[02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:41.953]  Let me tell you something, you know, the high-level real criminals, even when they're having meetings with each other, it's all in code.
[02:15:42.873 --> 02:15:59.861]  It's like these low-level people, like, watch criminals on TV, in my view, and they think that's, like, how you act as a cartoon character, like, hey, yeah, scumbag kid, yo, yeah, we let them have sex with the kids, it's no big deals, yeah, we blame the kids, hey, oh, what you gonna do, yeah.
[02:16:02.555 --> 02:16:06.141]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:13.111]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google, they have filed 13 lawsuits, we've beaten six.
[02:16:13.412 --> 02:16:17.558]  But understand this, I am your soldier, you're my soldier, we're all in this together.

[02:18:22.845 --> 02:18:25.888]  But immune wall is incredible at folks.
[02:18:26.068 --> 02:18:28.249]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:18:29.130 --> 02:18:29.810]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:18:30.251 --> 02:18:33.073]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:18:33.713 --> 02:18:34.693]  And so much more.
[02:18:35.254 --> 02:18:36.394]  It is concentrated.
[02:18:36.614 --> 02:18:38.335]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:18:38.355 --> 02:18:44.037]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:18:44.137 --> 02:18:45.337]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:18:45.357 --> 02:18:47.298]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:18:47.378 --> 02:18:49.759]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:18:49.959 --> 02:18:51.220]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.220]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:18:53.781 --> 02:18:54.381]  Immune Wall.
[02:18:54.481 --> 02:18:55.781]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:55.921 --> 02:18:57.102]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:07.065 --> 02:19:10.166]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:19:10.206 --> 02:19:10.726]  You're on the air.
[02:19:10.746 --> 02:19:11.286]  Thanks for holding.
[02:19:11.687 --> 02:19:12.767]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:19:12.967 --> 02:19:13.587]  Hey, brother.
[02:19:13.887 --> 02:19:14.247]  Good, man.
[02:19:14.268 --> 02:19:15.068]  Thank you for calling.
[02:19:15.148 --> 02:19:15.688]  Hey, hey.
[02:19:15.808 --> 02:19:20.230]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:26.792]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:19:26.812 --> 02:19:28.632]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:19:28.732 --> 02:19:34.895]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:19:36.035 --> 02:19:37.156]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:19:37.216 --> 02:19:39.659]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:19:39.719 --> 02:19:41.240]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:19:41.621 --> 02:19:43.282]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:19:43.683 --> 02:19:44.403]  And exactly.
[02:19:44.423 --> 02:19:48.688]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:19:49.028 --> 02:19:49.288]  Boom!
[02:19:49.448 --> 02:19:52.271]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:19:52.331 --> 02:19:52.872]  It's amazing.
[02:19:52.932 --> 02:19:54.213]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:19:54.293 --> 02:19:57.156]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:09.334]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:36.129 --> 02:20:38.734]  Alright, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas is here with us.
[02:20:38.975 --> 02:20:40.338]  He got cut off by the break.
[02:20:40.778 --> 02:20:43.043]  He was saying some really powerful stuff during the break when we were talking.
[02:20:43.564 --> 02:20:46.270]  So James, please go back to where the Skype cut out, my friend.
[02:20:47.563 --> 02:20:48.164]  Yes, Alex.
[02:20:48.204 --> 02:20:51.526]  I was just telling you before the Skype cut off that this is a war.
[02:20:51.546 --> 02:20:54.748]  I mean, we're insurgents fighting this war.
[02:20:54.768 --> 02:20:59.772]  I got an 8,000-word magazine piece in Politico asking me to condemn you, Alex.
[02:20:59.832 --> 02:21:02.194]  And I said, I will not condemn Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.714 --> 02:21:03.715]  We are fighting a war.
[02:21:03.735 --> 02:21:13.122]  We are insurgents up against an unjust world with a propaganda media that... And it's not that these guys are bad people or they're bad journalists.
[02:21:13.142 --> 02:21:15.804]  They're just part of a system that manufactures consent.
[02:21:16.894 --> 02:21:25.219]  And is so monolithic, and we have to provide a counterbalance by showing people the veritas, by showing people the real hidden truth, the great lies.
[02:21:25.899 --> 02:21:30.962]  And your audience has been so supportive that we've hired more undercover journalists than ever before.
[02:21:31.002 --> 02:21:36.044]  We've grown so big that this union story you're seeing, this teachers union thing, you've seen two tapes.
[02:21:36.064 --> 02:21:39.866]  You're about to see the one in Union City where the woman covers up child abuse.
[02:21:40.286 --> 02:21:41.427]  That's her right there.
[02:21:42.222 --> 02:21:43.482]  And I'm going to talk about that in a second.
[02:21:43.802 --> 02:21:44.503]  But you're seeing us.
[02:21:44.543 --> 02:21:47.864]  We're going to be doing a Blitzkrieg all throughout the month of May.
[02:21:47.884 --> 02:21:50.485]  You're going to see tape after tape after tape after tape.
[02:21:50.925 --> 02:21:52.445]  That is a result of us hiring people.
[02:21:52.485 --> 02:21:54.226]  And I do want to talk about this tape real quick.
[02:21:54.686 --> 02:21:57.887]  Kathleen Valencia, I need your audience to do something for me.
[02:21:58.287 --> 02:22:01.188]  This this person is the president of the Teachers Union.
[02:22:01.228 --> 02:22:05.109]  And there's a clip in there where she says, and this is the highlight, she says,
[02:22:05.669 --> 02:22:13.592]  This file is from a case where a teacher had sex with a teenage girl, and she says, he's not going to jail, we're protecting his pension.
[02:22:14.032 --> 02:22:15.412]  We don't have the name of the teacher.
[02:22:15.432 --> 02:22:28.017]  What I'd like your audience to do, Alex, is I want them to call and email and tweet the NJEA, that's the New Jersey Education Association, the biggest teachers' union in the state, and I want you to ask, what is the name of that person?
[02:22:28.417 --> 02:22:29.037]  That's all I want.
[02:22:29.597 --> 02:22:30.517]  Put the pressure on.
[02:22:30.778 --> 02:22:33.859]  They've already suspended one president, and there it is right there.
[02:22:33.879 --> 02:22:35.880]  If you could play the clip for the audience, that'd be awesome.
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:37.620]  We're gonna do that, but let me just say this briefly.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:40.401]  I'm gonna play even more whenever you go, but we'll play some now.
[02:22:41.442 --> 02:22:43.423]  I hadn't even seen this new clip until you got on.
[02:22:43.463 --> 02:22:44.283]  I saw it during the break.
[02:22:44.363 --> 02:22:45.503]  It made me physically sick.
[02:22:45.583 --> 02:22:48.965]  I have three daughters, and just the nonchalant
[02:22:49.958 --> 02:23:08.814]  Aiding and abetting the crime of rape and child molestation like it's nonchalant, like she's talking about the weather, is earth-shattering and it's systemic and it's bizarre and it's crazy and it just shows the mindset of we're going to protect a reported child rapist
[02:23:09.434 --> 02:23:10.034]  Pension?
[02:23:10.855 --> 02:23:13.216]  It's just, my God, where do they find these people?
[02:23:13.236 --> 02:23:14.917]  Let's play the clip you're talking about.
[02:23:14.957 --> 02:23:15.778]  Here it is, hidden camera.
[02:23:16.198 --> 02:23:21.701]  Union president and Mr. Protecting Teacher who had sex, that's a quote, with teenage girl willing to cover up abuse of scumbag.
[02:23:21.961 --> 02:23:22.301]  Here it is.
[02:23:22.321 --> 02:23:28.164]  This file right here is from a teacher who had sex with a student.
[02:23:29.565 --> 02:23:29.685]  Okay?
[02:23:29.705 --> 02:23:30.666]  You're not going to jail.
[02:23:32.987 --> 02:23:34.288]  You know what this whole file is about?
[02:23:45.206 --> 02:23:45.547]  Oh yeah.
[02:23:45.567 --> 02:23:46.127]  Kid's fine.
[02:24:03.363 --> 02:24:03.884]  He's not hurt.
[02:24:21.344 --> 02:24:22.645]  So what you're doing is invaluable.
[02:24:22.665 --> 02:24:25.387]  That's why I want to continue to try to support the work you're doing.
[02:24:25.667 --> 02:24:33.552]  But like you said, the real thing is spreading the word, getting your videos out so that people understand what we're facing and the true face of evil we're dealing with.
[02:24:33.592 --> 02:24:45.500]  I don't know how they're going to be able to protect this union president in New Jersey when she's saying stuff that I would expect would bring the villagers with the pitchforks, you know, coming after, uh, coming after Frankenstein and his monster.
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:47.001]  I'm not calling for violence here.
[02:24:47.482 --> 02:24:50.444]  I'm just saying anybody sexually assaults one of my daughters,
[02:24:51.204 --> 02:24:53.744]  And I find out people ate it and abetted it.
[02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:57.525]  I find them just as guilty as the dirtbag child molester.
[02:24:58.465 --> 02:25:02.726]  Well, well, well, Alex, they suspended the president last night, David Perry.
[02:25:02.766 --> 02:25:04.006]  Now there's this new person.
[02:25:04.026 --> 02:25:20.269]  What I'd like your audience to do, it's very simple, is go online, contact the NJEA, and tweet at them, or Facebook at them, or email them, pick up the phone and call them, and ask, what is the name of the teacher who had sex with the girl that they protected?
[02:25:20.689 --> 02:25:22.030]  That is a real person.
[02:25:22.090 --> 02:25:24.191]  It's in a document that she flashed before us.
[02:25:24.211 --> 02:25:25.411]  We couldn't read the document.
[02:25:25.792 --> 02:25:27.252]  She flashed it so quickly.
[02:25:27.673 --> 02:25:28.693]  We just want the name of the student.
[02:25:28.713 --> 02:25:29.734]  Let's keep the pressure on.
[02:25:30.214 --> 02:25:32.855]  As Alinsky would say, keep the pressure on the opposition.
[02:25:33.255 --> 02:25:34.496]  Expose the... There they are.
[02:25:34.556 --> 02:25:35.396]  The NJEA.
[02:25:35.476 --> 02:25:36.097]  Tweet at them.
[02:25:36.117 --> 02:25:38.078]  At NJEA.
[02:25:38.638 --> 02:25:40.519]  And there's their phone number and email address there.
[02:25:41.059 --> 02:25:43.620]  And just ask for the name of the student.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:44.861]  We get the name of the teacher.
[02:25:45.041 --> 02:25:45.641]  Not the name of the student.
[02:25:45.661 --> 02:25:46.142]  The name of the teacher.
[02:25:46.162 --> 02:25:46.802]  We get that name.
[02:25:47.422 --> 02:25:52.843]  And we probably have another resignation, more pressure, more accountability and exposure for a very important issue.
[02:25:52.963 --> 02:25:54.484]  Well, I gotta say, you have incredible courage.
[02:25:54.504 --> 02:25:55.604]  They've tried to put you in prison.
[02:25:55.624 --> 02:25:56.104]  They've sued you.
[02:25:56.144 --> 02:25:56.824]  They've attacked you.
[02:25:57.464 --> 02:25:58.645]  You know somebody by their enemies.
[02:25:58.705 --> 02:26:03.906]  But the fact that you get that they contact us, they contact everybody, and they say, disavow James O'Keefe.
[02:26:04.166 --> 02:26:06.727]  He's a criminal because you snuck in a government building one time.
[02:26:06.747 --> 02:26:09.027]  I mean, legally, up to the counter with a hidden microphone.
[02:26:09.107 --> 02:26:10.168]  I mean, you don't have a medal.
[02:26:12.088 --> 02:26:13.249]  They edit tapes of me.
[02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:14.990]  They say I say there's kids on Mars.
[02:26:15.430 --> 02:26:20.434]  All these lies so that all of us deny each other so none of us have a community when they're the globalists.
[02:26:20.474 --> 02:26:21.154]  They're the criminals.
[02:26:21.214 --> 02:26:26.077]  It's Hillary with the Lolita Express and Bill Clinton and the Haitian kids and all of it.
[02:26:26.338 --> 02:26:32.822]  They're the monsters that turn it around in the bully mainstream media and you're strong and you don't buckle and that's why they fear you.
[02:26:32.862 --> 02:26:33.582]  So we salute you.
[02:26:33.803 --> 02:26:34.423]  We appreciate you.
[02:26:34.443 --> 02:26:39.767]  We're gonna let you go and I'm gonna roll out the rest of the segment with this incredible bombshell at projectveritas.com.
[02:26:39.787 --> 02:26:40.287]  Hidden camera.
[02:26:41.988 --> 02:26:44.209]  Alright, there goes James O'Keefe.
[02:26:44.249 --> 02:26:50.793]  We're gonna go out to break right now, and we're going to roll out some more of this incredible stuff from New Jersey.
[02:26:50.813 --> 02:26:54.456]  Then we're gonna come back with a bunch of other massively important news.
[02:26:54.496 --> 02:26:55.136]  Please stay with us.
[02:27:12.964 --> 02:27:14.105]  You're not going to jail.
[02:27:16.387 --> 02:27:17.788]  You know what this whole file is about?
[02:27:19.249 --> 02:27:21.210]  It's about whether or not they get to keep their pension.
[02:27:21.951 --> 02:27:22.231]  Okay.
[02:27:23.392 --> 02:27:27.355]  Sex with a teenage girl.
[02:27:28.656 --> 02:27:29.016]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:29.236 --> 02:27:32.018]  Is he going to jail?
[02:27:32.639 --> 02:27:32.859]  No.
[02:27:32.939 --> 02:27:35.221]  I'm being as brutally honest with you as I can.
[02:27:36.041 --> 02:27:42.346]  If you are afraid of a middle school child who called you an a**hole and spit on you and advanced towards you,
[02:27:42.967 --> 02:27:44.528]  You are in the wrong profession.
[02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:45.209]  Kid's fine.
[02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.630]  Kid's not hurt.
[02:27:47.171 --> 02:27:47.912]  Kid got a scratch.
[02:27:48.832 --> 02:27:49.693]  He's gonna give the kid a 65.
[02:27:49.733 --> 02:27:49.973]  Right?
[02:27:52.438 --> 02:27:53.379]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:27:54.319 --> 02:27:54.499]  No.
[02:27:54.619 --> 02:27:54.759]  No.
[02:27:54.779 --> 02:27:55.080]  No.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.180]  He's not gonna fail the kid?
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:56.340]  No.
[02:27:56.941 --> 02:28:02.124]  He's gonna get that kid out of his f***ing classroom and move on fresh for September.
[02:28:02.684 --> 02:28:04.865]  We're facing a crisis in American education.
[02:28:05.085 --> 02:28:07.647]  And this week, the NJEA is under fire.
[02:28:08.087 --> 02:28:11.069]  Teachers unions would have you believe that they're fighting for our children.
[02:28:11.569 --> 02:28:17.372]  But the evidence in these tapes show they're fighting for themselves, their survival, and their own dominance.
[02:28:17.973 --> 02:28:22.075]  On day two of our continuing investigation into the teachers unions across America,
[02:28:22.335 --> 02:28:23.677]  We are back in New Jersey.
[02:28:23.697 --> 02:28:28.005]  The video you're about to see and hear shocked and deeply disturbed us.
[02:28:28.746 --> 02:28:29.187]  Hello?
[02:28:29.568 --> 02:28:30.008]  Hi!
[02:28:30.249 --> 02:28:30.670]  How are you?
[02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:31.731]  I just called you.
[02:28:34.766 --> 02:28:40.627]  Meet Kathleen Valencia, a history teacher and the president of the Union City Education Association.
[02:28:41.007 --> 02:28:43.268]  Within minutes of meeting our journalist, Ms.
[02:28:43.308 --> 02:28:48.569]  Valencia boasted about how her office protected a teacher who had sex with a teenage student.
[02:28:48.949 --> 02:28:50.409]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:28:50.449 --> 02:28:52.610]  That is a hardcore felony of true.
[02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:57.330]  That is protecting child endangerment, aiding and abetting statutory right bare minimum.
[02:28:57.791 --> 02:28:58.971]  And that is America.
[02:28:59.031 --> 02:28:59.851]  That's the Democrats.
[02:29:02.853 --> 02:29:04.676]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:29:04.716 --> 02:29:05.077]  Go ahead.
[02:29:05.938 --> 02:29:07.841]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:29:07.881 --> 02:29:17.276]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:29:18.067 --> 02:29:24.629]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[02:29:24.849 --> 02:29:27.010]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[02:29:27.090 --> 02:29:27.490]  Thank you.
[02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:30.631]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[02:29:30.651 --> 02:29:34.393]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[02:29:34.973 --> 02:29:37.934]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:29:37.994 --> 02:29:38.954]  They are quality.
[02:29:39.294 --> 02:29:40.555]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:29:41.035 --> 02:29:43.756]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:29:43.916 --> 02:29:44.496]  Absolutely.
[02:29:44.977 --> 02:29:57.899]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[02:30:03.863 --> 02:30:09.189]  Melania did not kick me out of the White House for installing coal-burning fireplaces.
[02:30:09.589 --> 02:30:10.750]  Fake news!
[02:30:11.451 --> 02:30:12.192]  Mr. President!
[02:30:12.933 --> 02:30:16.276]  Why are you throwing balls at my face, Kurt Cousins?
[02:30:16.496 --> 02:30:17.157]  It's Kirk.
[02:30:17.437 --> 02:30:18.599]  That's what I said, Gerd.
[02:30:19.079 --> 02:30:22.323]  I'm making you Secretary of Offense.
[02:30:22.583 --> 02:30:25.326]  Now, prepare for fire and fury!
[02:30:32.526 --> 02:30:33.746]  You like that, Kirk Cousins?
[02:30:33.806 --> 02:30:34.527]  You like that?
[02:30:34.847 --> 02:30:36.067]  Well, there you have it.
[02:30:36.507 --> 02:30:37.428]  Terrific spot.
[02:30:38.408 --> 02:30:42.669]  Funny and satire without being overtly political or nasty.
[02:30:43.329 --> 02:30:45.570]  Congratulations, John D. Domenico.
[02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:51.612]  As someone who's known Donald Trump and studied his speech patterns myself for many years, you nailed it.
[02:30:51.772 --> 02:30:52.652]  You really nailed it.
[02:30:53.153 --> 02:30:54.913]  Thank you very much, Roger.
[02:30:54.933 --> 02:30:57.334]  I'm very excited to be on the show, I have to tell you.
[02:30:59.242 --> 02:31:15.129]  Well, I've been doing Trump since 2004, right around the end of the first season of The Apprentice, when there was a big demand corporately for Trump to come in and roast people and do apprentice games and things like that.
[02:31:15.249 --> 02:31:20.552]  So I've had a really long runway with him and to learn his voice and to really
[02:31:21.392 --> 02:31:24.154]  Get it down, especially these last two and a half years.
[02:31:24.494 --> 02:31:31.437]  Since he's announced, he's become more physical and his speech has become more him.
[02:31:31.457 --> 02:31:35.239]  It seems like he seems like he was very restricted on The Apprentice.
[02:31:35.279 --> 02:31:38.181]  Blue team, green team, he did a good job.
[02:31:38.201 --> 02:31:39.741]  The blue team, you're fired.
[02:31:39.781 --> 02:31:42.803]  It was kind of, he seems so big.
[02:31:43.223 --> 02:31:55.971]  In a way since I had been doing him for so long I had done him in so many other platforms that when he announced I was I wanted to make sure that he was 100% in the race and I thought to myself you know if he can make it to the first
[02:31:56.761 --> 02:32:13.873]  If he can make it to the first debate, I'll be set for the fall, because that's how, you know, they book out months in advance for these corporate things, and as you well know, not only did he make it to the first debate, he crushed it in the first debate, and the second debate, and the third debate, and then things just started taking off.
[02:32:13.913 --> 02:32:19.637]  And a friend of mine, Tom Shalhoub, who is on, he's still on Fox News, but he was on the show Red Eye,
[02:32:20.918 --> 02:32:21.658]  He brought me on.
[02:32:21.678 --> 02:32:25.140]  I think I did about 50, 60 appearances on Red Eye as Trump.
[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:28.262]  And then because of that, I did Fox and Friends a number of times.
[02:32:28.322 --> 02:32:36.847]  So it was a great platform and we did some really wonderful comedy and then some other shows picked me up and then voiceovers and the corporate stuff.
[02:32:36.887 --> 02:32:40.329]  And it's been kind of, it's pretty much taken over my, there's Tom right now.
[02:32:40.649 --> 02:32:42.730]  Tom Shalhoub, a very funny guy in his own right.
[02:32:42.810 --> 02:32:49.973]  Well, as you know, the pundits in the mainstream didn't see Trump coming, so I can see why it started slowly.
[02:32:50.493 --> 02:32:53.375]  They were the last people in the world who thought that he would win.
[02:32:53.415 --> 02:32:53.815]  What was it?
[02:32:53.855 --> 02:32:57.336]  Jeb Bush said, you're not going to insult your way into the presidency?
[02:32:58.017 --> 02:32:58.837]  Guess what, Jeb?
[02:32:59.397 --> 02:32:59.958]  Wrong.
[02:33:00.498 --> 02:33:00.958]  Wrong.
[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.801]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.209 --> 02:33:27.632]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:50.117 --> 02:33:55.402]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[02:33:55.422 --> 02:33:59.046]  There's a very important video from the start of the show today.
[02:34:00.067 --> 02:34:03.711]  Explosions, gunfire, and black helicopters terrorize New Jersey City.
[02:34:06.454 --> 02:34:12.220]  And again, that is a boil-down edit of that that we got posted up there to the site.
[02:34:13.695 --> 02:34:15.556]  Because remember, there's no such thing as black helicopters.
[02:34:15.576 --> 02:34:16.997]  They're just constantly doing this.
[02:34:17.097 --> 02:34:17.838]  And what is the point?
[02:34:18.298 --> 02:34:21.160]  Training the military and the public to accept troops on the ground.
[02:34:21.841 --> 02:34:22.781]  Do I blame Trump for that?
[02:34:23.302 --> 02:34:24.723]  Well, it got really big under Clinton.
[02:34:26.964 --> 02:34:28.686]  It went down a lot under Trump.
[02:34:29.006 --> 02:34:31.367]  It got big again under Obama.
[02:34:31.427 --> 02:34:32.428]  Not as big as under Clinton.
[02:34:32.608 --> 02:34:33.669]  And now it's back.
[02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:35.991]  And I've talked to the people involved.
[02:34:36.011 --> 02:34:36.751]  I know all about it.
[02:34:37.272 --> 02:34:40.294]  I've talked to people at every level of it.
[02:34:41.018 --> 02:34:47.422]  The people that fly the helicopters, the people that rappel down on the ropes, the emergency managers, the police chiefs that witness it.
[02:34:47.482 --> 02:34:48.783]  I made four films on it.
[02:34:49.403 --> 02:34:50.044]  I'm an expert.
[02:34:51.344 --> 02:34:52.945]  And it's going on.
[02:34:55.487 --> 02:34:56.508]  Now why is it so important?
[02:34:56.548 --> 02:34:58.449]  Because the mainstream media would tell you you're crazy.
[02:34:58.509 --> 02:34:59.670]  It's always on local news.
[02:35:00.486 --> 02:35:04.192]  But then if you talk about it nationally, or debate why it's happening, oh, you're bad.
[02:35:04.652 --> 02:35:06.635]  So, I never play the audio of this.
[02:35:06.656 --> 02:35:13.787]  I mean, we do in the special report, but Department of Defense training exercise terrifies unprepared Tottawa, New Jersey residents.
[02:35:15.307 --> 02:35:17.329]  So we just keep staying focused on New Jersey.
[02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:23.296]  We just had the two different union heads saying they cover up crimes and sex crimes against children.
[02:35:23.537 --> 02:35:24.958]  One lady says it's just insane.
[02:35:24.978 --> 02:35:26.620]  So I guess we're obsessed with New Jersey.
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:27.641]  Back to New Jersey.
[02:35:28.002 --> 02:35:30.164]  Let's go ahead and go to the CBS News report and analyze it.
[02:35:30.204 --> 02:35:30.465]  Here it is.
[02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:31.990]  Oh, that is sick!
[02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:33.411]  I've never seen anything like this before.
[02:35:33.431 --> 02:35:34.832]  There was a Blackhawk helicopter flying right over here.
[02:35:56.349 --> 02:36:02.335]  He can now laugh and even brag about what happened, but in the heat of the moment, he says his entire block was petrified.
[02:36:02.515 --> 02:36:03.195]  I was really scared.
[02:36:03.215 --> 02:36:04.296]  I had no idea what was going on.
[02:36:04.877 --> 02:36:09.581]  Around 10 o'clock at night on April 16th, this community was rocked by piercing explosions.
[02:36:09.601 --> 02:36:12.904]  We're scared about that, you know, that's happening at night time.
[02:36:13.124 --> 02:36:14.526]  First it was explosions.
[02:36:15.887 --> 02:36:19.329]  And then the chopper was so low that our house was vibrating.
[02:36:19.809 --> 02:36:22.051]  Most of the block came running outside in panic.
[02:36:22.391 --> 02:36:27.194]  John Imola says his daughter called 911 to find out what was happening, but got a short answer.
[02:36:27.454 --> 02:36:29.556]  They said, well, you got to talk to the state police about it.
[02:36:30.096 --> 02:36:35.199]  Eventually, they learned members of the United States Armed Forces were training in secret for three nights.
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:40.403]  So we went to both local and state police to find out why these residents weren't given a heads up.
[02:36:42.697 --> 02:36:46.960]  Neighbors say they should have been informed, and next time they're hoping they get a heads up.
[02:36:49.182 --> 02:36:50.823]  Notice no response from the state police.
[02:36:50.843 --> 02:36:54.645]  In the old days, they'd say, you're insane, it didn't happen.
[02:36:55.726 --> 02:36:58.348]  They'd write front page news articles saying I was insane in the paper.
[02:36:59.849 --> 02:37:01.590]  In fact, there are scans of those online.
[02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:10.897]  Maybe click Alex Jones, Black Helicopters Texas, Alex Jones, I think.
[02:37:12.196 --> 02:37:27.929]  Army, Texas raids, and you can click images on Bing, because Google's so bad, or use one of the other sub-pages, and you can also search web, WorldNetDaily did stories on it, and then you can actually see a lot better video than what they got off his cell phone.
[02:37:27.949 --> 02:37:34.715]  But notice, they were doing it at a former government facility that was under construction.
[02:37:35.055 --> 02:37:39.259]  That means they gutted it, they were going to do damage to it, then they're going to either tear it down or rebuild it.
[02:37:40.109 --> 02:37:46.414]  Like I told you, they always do it at some unnamed site, in the middle of the neighborhood, as a PSYOP test.
[02:37:47.895 --> 02:37:54.320]  And it's always formulaic, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:37:54.861 --> 02:37:56.442]  So again, if you're a radio listener, you can see this.
[02:37:57.843 --> 02:38:06.390]  But, just another thing we told you about 23 years ago, that nowadays, they admit is going on.
[02:38:08.942 --> 02:38:09.702]  And it's the same thing.
[02:38:10.523 --> 02:38:11.603]  Cell phone radiation.
[02:38:12.604 --> 02:38:13.464]  It's getting stronger.
[02:38:13.844 --> 02:38:14.804]  They're putting more of them up.
[02:38:15.485 --> 02:38:18.006]  Brain tumors alone, directly connected to it, doubling.
[02:38:19.286 --> 02:38:20.647]  Brain tumors aren't fun, folks.
[02:38:20.707 --> 02:38:21.547]  Dying ain't cool.
[02:38:22.948 --> 02:38:27.230]  But everybody in this domesticated Western world doesn't believe something bad till it hits them.
[02:38:30.691 --> 02:38:33.152]  And people even laugh at me on the street.
[02:38:33.172 --> 02:38:37.914]  They go, oh, it's the gay frog guy, or, oh, the cell phones are gonna get me, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:38:40.407 --> 02:38:46.172]  My children, I let them have cell phones when they're going out with friends or something for security saying, I say, don't put it up your head, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:47.313 --> 02:38:49.815]  And then they go, oh, dad, it's not bad for us.
[02:38:49.895 --> 02:38:50.835]  I just totally took them away.
[02:38:50.855 --> 02:38:56.480]  Because they are great tools, you know, to keep track of your children.
[02:38:58.321 --> 02:38:59.743]  You know, Rex wanted to do a report on it.
[02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:01.424]  Cell phones are more dangerous than cigarette smoking.
[02:39:03.991 --> 02:39:07.453]  And we're just here trying to warn folks, and guess what videos?
[02:39:08.093 --> 02:39:11.795]  Facebook, Twitter, and Google particularly block and shadow ban.
[02:39:12.376 --> 02:39:14.517]  Where they don't virally spread, but you have to hand share them.
[02:39:15.357 --> 02:39:15.938]  Bingo!
[02:39:16.778 --> 02:39:21.081]  Anything about actresses, the interchemicals in the water, affecting your sexuality, banned.
[02:39:21.921 --> 02:39:24.302]  Anything warning you about cell phone brain tumors.
[02:39:25.743 --> 02:39:28.725]  Because there's a big, fat, juicy corporate agenda.
[02:39:30.728 --> 02:39:33.149]  But the elites are going to these spas in the middle of nowhere.
[02:39:33.189 --> 02:39:34.930]  They fly out there by jet or helicopter.
[02:39:35.310 --> 02:39:36.331]  No Wi-Fi allowed.
[02:39:37.551 --> 02:39:38.572]  No cell phones allowed.
[02:39:38.592 --> 02:39:40.873]  No cell phones allowed in Bohemian Grove.
[02:39:41.894 --> 02:39:42.654]  No Wi-Fi.
[02:39:42.894 --> 02:39:43.554]  Nothing's allowed.
[02:39:44.895 --> 02:39:46.196]  The rich people go to these resorts.
[02:39:48.257 --> 02:39:49.538]  They have landline telephones.
[02:39:50.458 --> 02:39:52.499]  Only one television in the whole lodge.
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:55.661]  Now there's CNN.
[02:39:55.681 --> 02:39:57.722]  Florida exposure in utero linked to lower IQs.
[02:39:59.138 --> 02:40:00.619]  Yeah, there's an old David Rosanne article.
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:02.901]  Yes, Texas, there are black helicopters.
[02:40:03.822 --> 02:40:05.003]  Scroll down, I'm in that article.
[02:40:06.284 --> 02:40:11.048]  And man, that was such a big deal for me at the time because grudge report and stuff linked to it.
[02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:13.670]  And people didn't believe.
[02:40:14.131 --> 02:40:14.891]  Read the whole series.
[02:40:14.911 --> 02:40:16.313]  It's got photos and videos I shot.
[02:40:17.554 --> 02:40:18.975]  Operation Last Dance in Texas.
[02:40:20.456 --> 02:40:24.720]  But imagine, the paper would say I had made it up.
[02:40:26.874 --> 02:40:36.279]  And imagine that when you're sitting there with an Austin, American statesman, state police, cheap dip guys, former state police lieutenant, and they're writing articles basically saying it doesn't exist.
[02:40:41.962 --> 02:40:42.462]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:40:42.582 --> 02:40:45.764]  Alex Jones forced their plans to be changed.
[02:40:49.807 --> 02:40:55.828]  I was aware of a proposed tabletop exercise, that means not real life, which was to occur in Austin last year.
[02:40:56.629 --> 02:41:01.890]  The word was the feds were to pay $500,000 to the city of Austin for their cooperation.
[02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:10.212]  Vreeland told RollNetDaily he said the publicity caused by local talk show host Alex Jones forced the plans to be changed.
[02:41:12.092 --> 02:41:14.113]  And boy did the city get pissed.
[02:41:15.509 --> 02:41:23.715]  Then the police didn't believe me about it, till later they talked to the Delta Force guys and they said, no, it's Bill Clinton, he's training us for PDD gun confiscation.
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.943]  But imagine, that was like in 1996, 97, it was so revolutionary.
[02:41:38.046 --> 02:41:44.290]  Because, I mean, they had me on CBS, NBC, they had late night comics making fun of me.
[02:41:44.571 --> 02:41:44.991]  Jay Leno!
[02:41:48.516 --> 02:41:48.856]  Jay Leno.
[02:41:48.876 --> 02:41:53.980]  Oh, and yeah, a guy Alex Jones in Texas with those wacko Bred Davidians, I bet.
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:55.041]  Yeah.
[02:41:56.201 --> 02:41:57.522]  Yeah, and the black helicopters.
[02:41:57.562 --> 02:41:58.463]  He believes in those things.
[02:41:58.523 --> 02:41:59.844]  Oh, yeah, and Martians.
[02:42:03.887 --> 02:42:05.088]  All because I went and got video.
[02:42:06.289 --> 02:42:07.509]  All because I proved it was happening.
[02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:10.692]  Here we are 20 years later, 22 years later.
[02:42:14.614 --> 02:42:17.577]  And all of it, world government, brain cancer from the cell phones.
[02:42:18.638 --> 02:42:20.280]  The smart meters watch you.
[02:42:20.521 --> 02:42:21.482]  They don't have cameras.
[02:42:21.522 --> 02:42:25.207]  They have a scanner, like a body scanner, that's much, much, much more powerful.
[02:42:26.189 --> 02:42:35.462]  It's sending out these little particles, these little radiation waves that then bounce back on a sensor and it gives it an image.
[02:42:38.837 --> 02:42:39.937]  This is not of this world, folks.
[02:42:39.957 --> 02:42:41.158]  This is like an alien invasion.
[02:42:41.938 --> 02:42:44.499]  I'm not saying that's what it is, but this is like a science fiction movie.
[02:42:44.839 --> 02:42:47.600]  And people have to really understand that.
[02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:49.381]  This is no game.
[02:42:49.481 --> 02:42:50.441]  This is no joke.
[02:42:50.721 --> 02:42:51.741]  You can get out of the trance.
[02:42:51.761 --> 02:42:52.982]  You can get conscious of this.
[02:42:53.262 --> 02:42:54.542]  You can think about what's happening.
[02:42:54.562 --> 02:42:55.863]  You can get concerned.
[02:43:02.142 --> 02:43:06.608]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:43:06.709 --> 02:43:15.020]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:16.723]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:43:17.688 --> 02:43:23.631]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:27.852]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:43:28.733 --> 02:43:36.716]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:43:37.316 --> 02:43:44.980]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:49.547]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:43:50.108 --> 02:43:54.075]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:43:55.152 --> 02:44:10.020]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.763]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:44:16.103 --> 02:44:17.644]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:44:17.944 --> 02:44:19.345]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:44:19.405 --> 02:44:23.889]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:28.752]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:44:28.772 --> 02:44:30.093]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:44:30.934 --> 02:44:36.238]  The average supplement, you look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:44:36.258 --> 02:44:36.958]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:44:36.978 --> 02:44:38.519]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:44:38.539 --> 02:44:39.580]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:41.562]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:44:47.506 --> 02:44:48.347]  But here's an example.
[02:44:49.188 --> 02:44:56.774]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:44:56.794 --> 02:44:58.516]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:44:58.976 --> 02:45:05.141]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:45:05.822 --> 02:45:10.925]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:45:11.205 --> 02:45:19.550]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:45:19.951 --> 02:45:20.971]  Nobody else does that.
[02:45:21.051 --> 02:45:23.753]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:45:24.253 --> 02:45:33.999]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in
[02:45:34.019 --> 02:45:40.424]  Again, quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:45:40.804 --> 02:45:49.770]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the globalists, a 360 win.
[02:45:50.110 --> 02:45:52.132]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:45:52.512 --> 02:45:57.796]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:45:57.816 --> 02:45:58.216]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:02.139 --> 02:46:05.481]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:13.287]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[02:46:13.847 --> 02:46:20.052]  With InfoWars Life Select Storable Food, you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.

[02:46:30.459 --> 02:46:37.201]  Including meals such as Traveler Stew, Homestyle Potato Soup, and a variety of other meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[02:46:37.601 --> 02:46:42.143]  InfoWars Life Select storable food will help you eat comfortably in a time of need.

[02:46:44.643 --> 02:46:50.925]  Simply pack a 72-hour kit to go and you have easy-to-cook and transport food for you and your loved ones trip.

[02:46:56.669 --> 02:47:00.372]  For an affordable price with InfoWars Life Select storable foods.
[02:47:06.097 --> 02:47:08.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:20.109]  We now take you live to the front lines of the fight.
[02:47:31.484 --> 02:47:41.091]  You know, I really should just sit here all day and read headlines off Infowars.com.
[02:47:41.111 --> 02:47:50.239]  50, 60 incredible stories we put out ourselves, and there's all the other hundreds, but the big meat and potatoes issues are globalism,
[02:47:51.513 --> 02:48:00.080]  The eugenics operations, the depopulation, the satanic nature of them, how they're basically protecting giant pedophile rings, big evidence of that today, Project Veritas.
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:08.746]  So that those of us that aren't evil, innately, we all have sin, we all have evil in us, but we're not, our will isn't evil, we love God, our hearts pointed towards God.
[02:48:09.967 --> 02:48:10.788]  We're trying to be good.
[02:48:12.909 --> 02:48:18.053]  We certainly don't want to molest children, or protect those that are doing it, like Project Veritas has reportedly confirmed.
[02:48:19.194 --> 02:48:20.355]  There's the woman on tape saying it.
[02:48:24.434 --> 02:48:25.414]  The head of the teachers union.
[02:48:27.675 --> 02:48:28.375]  In a major city.
[02:48:30.316 --> 02:48:31.336]  Two videos in one day.
[02:48:31.356 --> 02:48:41.220]  And you just realize what we're up against is just people that have sold out, and once you sell out for something small, you'll sell out for anything.
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:48.002]  And you know, I've recently learned some information.
[02:48:50.185 --> 02:49:00.891]  About some of the past cases we've covered that we've then said, oh, maybe we weren't 100% right and backed off of, and then right in your lap drops something that's total synchronicity, serendipity, and you're like, what do you do?
[02:49:03.472 --> 02:49:04.833]  Those are decisions you make in life.
[02:49:05.773 --> 02:49:07.554]  Good God, these people are bad.
[02:49:08.595 --> 02:49:10.636]  And let me tell you something, we're rarely wrong.
[02:49:12.597 --> 02:49:16.859]  Just when I get convinced I'm wrong, I get hit by a thunderbolt.
[02:49:18.404 --> 02:49:21.146]  Between the eyes of total confirmation.
[02:49:22.307 --> 02:49:23.748]  And I'm not talking about this Veritas video.
[02:49:23.808 --> 02:49:24.648]  It's pretty bad, isn't it?
[02:49:25.108 --> 02:49:26.029]  This stuff's even worse.
[02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:27.670]  And you're like, really?
[02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:31.332]  And just covering it, you feel dirty.
[02:49:31.393 --> 02:49:32.873]  Just fighting it, you feel dirty.
[02:49:35.855 --> 02:49:37.256]  And then you gotta be around these people.
[02:49:40.038 --> 02:49:40.178]  Ugh.
[02:49:40.759 --> 02:49:42.660]  You gotta have their evil intention focused at you.
[02:49:44.101 --> 02:49:46.963]  But, you know, you saw James O'Keefe and how they had a
[02:49:50.886 --> 02:49:52.206]  8,000 words?
[02:49:52.286 --> 02:49:52.927]  Did he say 8,000?
[02:49:53.867 --> 02:49:54.087]  Or 800?
[02:49:55.547 --> 02:49:58.048]  Huge political story saying denounce Alex Jones.
[02:49:58.768 --> 02:50:00.989]  I can't even keep track of all that.
[02:50:04.109 --> 02:50:09.991]  Of the hit pieces every couple minutes and the lies and the disinfo and the twisting.
[02:50:13.692 --> 02:50:17.133]  But I know we're gonna come through it because of your prayers and we are the tip of the spirits.
[02:50:17.213 --> 02:50:18.113]  Our job to take
[02:50:19.858 --> 02:50:21.640]  On the hard topics and to get attacked.
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:22.480]  Somebody's got to do it.
[02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:23.841]  We're here to get the word out.
[02:50:25.243 --> 02:50:26.824]  We're not here to be the most popular in the media.
[02:50:27.204 --> 02:50:29.066]  Hell, if I was going to do that, why not join the globalists?
[02:50:32.148 --> 02:50:37.013]  Coming up, Lionel, former prosecutor, author, radio host, TV host, always does a great job.
[02:50:37.033 --> 02:50:41.897]  He's loaded for bear right now on the whole Mueller thing, and that's all going the way Roger Stone and others said it would.
[02:50:41.917 --> 02:50:45.179]  And then Dr. Gribbs will be back on with that incredible expanded presentation.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.202]  They're in the Owen Schroer boardroom coming up.
[02:50:51.010 --> 02:50:51.830]  Roger Stone and others.
[02:50:53.971 --> 02:51:17.317]  I got all this other serious news I want to hit and you know I didn't want to go on a warpath against Ben Shapiro because I know he's attacked me and lied about me and stuff for years and tried to control what I say and do and try to control who's on the show and I knew what his connections before at Talk Radio Network and I heard about this guy a long time ago like hey this guy's bad news by really cool people and
[02:51:20.785 --> 02:51:23.646]  Then I'm like, wait, Glenn Beck, wait, taking that over, wait.
[02:51:24.447 --> 02:51:25.307]  And I'm like, really?
[02:51:26.307 --> 02:51:29.789]  Like Glenn Beck was always trying to get me kicked off stations in my business.
[02:51:30.789 --> 02:51:33.430]  And now he's over, this guy's over here again in my life.
[02:51:35.111 --> 02:51:44.095]  And these guys think just because they are these aggressive, deceptive manipulators that we're all dumb just because we don't operate like they do.
[02:51:46.940 --> 02:51:49.841]  But I just can't take a Glenn Beck Part 2 in my neighborhood.
[02:51:50.561 --> 02:51:51.901]  I've taken enough abuse from these people.
[02:51:53.542 --> 02:52:00.643]  These fake Christians, and now the whole Jordan Peterson, atheist, humanist, liberal takeover of the conservative movement.
[02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:04.504]  You ever get that Peterson clip where he's on Bill Maher last week and he goes, I'm not a conservative!
[02:52:05.405 --> 02:52:07.125]  But that's his... Pardon me?
[02:52:08.886 --> 02:52:09.226]  Oh, really?
[02:52:09.506 --> 02:52:09.926]  I saw it.
[02:52:10.286 --> 02:52:10.686]  They saw it.
[02:52:10.706 --> 02:52:11.286]  It was on there.
[02:52:11.786 --> 02:52:12.446]  It's in his appearance.
[02:52:12.486 --> 02:52:13.767]  You can just scan through it.
[02:52:14.007 --> 02:52:14.447]  It's right there.
[02:52:16.575 --> 02:52:17.296]  Go ask Scott.
[02:52:17.436 --> 02:52:18.016]  He saw it too.
[02:52:18.116 --> 02:52:19.037]  Scott can give it to you, thanks.
[02:52:19.557 --> 02:52:21.539]  But, and I know everybody knows that.
[02:52:21.579 --> 02:52:23.660]  I'm just saying, and I don't think I'm in competition with these guys.
[02:52:26.902 --> 02:52:28.904]  It's that I know Shapiro's history.
[02:52:29.004 --> 02:52:29.704]  I know who he is.
[02:52:29.744 --> 02:52:30.365]  I know what he does.
[02:52:30.385 --> 02:52:31.246]  I know about Glenn Beck.
[02:52:32.086 --> 02:52:33.907]  And these guys that think they're there to lead us.
[02:52:35.769 --> 02:52:37.850]  And they all come down here to Texas with Ted Cruz.
[02:52:38.751 --> 02:52:40.172]  I mean, I don't go up to Canada.
[02:52:41.752 --> 02:52:45.415]  Tell me Montreal, and then try to tell everybody what to do.
[02:52:46.156 --> 02:52:47.196]  Or I don't go out to L.A.
[02:52:47.237 --> 02:52:48.277]  and tell everybody I'm a Texan.
[02:52:49.098 --> 02:52:49.438]  Or whatever.
[02:52:49.578 --> 02:52:50.699]  You know, it just gets old.
[02:52:52.561 --> 02:52:55.003]  Just to watch him in the cowboy boots and everything going, Hey!
[02:52:55.023 --> 02:52:56.504]  Don't trust me there, buddy!
[02:52:56.604 --> 02:52:57.285]  Get on down there!
[02:52:57.305 --> 02:52:59.006]  Don't listen to that Alex Jones!
[02:52:59.046 --> 02:52:59.847]  Not a good Texan!
[02:52:59.867 --> 02:53:00.648]  Not a good American!
[02:53:00.828 --> 02:53:01.308]  Listen to me!
[02:53:01.608 --> 02:53:02.529]  We're gonna vote for Hillary!
[02:53:02.929 --> 02:53:03.110]  Hey!
[02:53:03.490 --> 02:53:04.030]  I'm going back!
[02:53:04.311 --> 02:53:05.051]  Sidebuster here!
[02:53:05.391 --> 02:53:06.953]  Gunslinger, par excellence there!
[02:53:07.853 --> 02:53:09.575]  They're golden, them here heroes over there!
[02:53:14.517 --> 02:53:20.962]  But separate from that, there are people that get intimidated and bullied into going along with the globalists.
[02:53:22.743 --> 02:53:32.311]  And then, there are people that are really with the globalists, who understand they have to be the loyal opposition.
[02:53:32.651 --> 02:53:35.093]  That they can't beat us, but they're straight on attack.
[02:53:35.353 --> 02:53:38.175]  So they gotta have somebody that's a go-between in the middle.
[02:53:41.938 --> 02:53:42.999]  Our buddies, our friends.
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:45.441]  And it makes me want to throw up.
[02:53:46.061 --> 02:53:51.605]  Before I end this hour, I want to explain something to listeners here, in case I haven't been clear about it.
[02:53:53.486 --> 02:53:55.388]  We don't just sell high-quality supplements.
[02:53:56.909 --> 02:54:05.275]  They fund this operation in the face of all the fake right-wing opposition, the left-wing opposition, Soros, Hillary, the globalists, in case you haven't noticed.
[02:54:07.016 --> 02:54:11.959]  NBC, you know, Today Show saying our goal is to shut Alex Jones down, to stop him.
[02:54:11.979 --> 02:54:14.001]  I mean, they mean it.
[02:54:15.484 --> 02:54:19.386]  And they're not going to be able to do it if you simply intensify your support.
[02:54:19.746 --> 02:54:23.549]  I know they're trying to shut down Veritas, so I send them some money.
[02:54:23.569 --> 02:54:27.451]  I know they're trying to shut down Tommy Robinson, so I send them money.
[02:54:27.691 --> 02:54:28.932]  Because all I care about is results.
[02:54:29.232 --> 02:54:31.473]  If I had a lot more money, I'd send it.
[02:54:31.513 --> 02:54:33.014]  And there's no strings attached, by the way.
[02:54:33.354 --> 02:54:35.855]  You take other people's money, they want to control what you do.
[02:54:36.676 --> 02:54:37.556]  So I don't take anybody's money.
[02:54:37.977 --> 02:54:38.637]  I give the money out.
[02:54:39.944 --> 02:54:48.248]  And the thing is, if you buy a massive amount of my products, I can't just expand this place and not just beat these fake lawsuits and then countersue them so they don't send more.
[02:54:48.268 --> 02:54:52.271]  Because you gotta defeat the minions, you know, to teach them.
[02:54:52.291 --> 02:54:53.651]  Because the globalists don't care.
[02:54:53.671 --> 02:54:54.772]  They'll just keep filing.
[02:54:54.792 --> 02:54:56.753]  You gotta teach the people that file the fake stuff.
[02:55:00.215 --> 02:55:02.476]  But we'll also just sit here and seed money.
[02:55:02.496 --> 02:55:05.277]  You know, 100%.
[02:55:05.397 --> 02:55:05.537]  Boom.
[02:55:08.151 --> 02:55:11.974]  The money that comes in that's dedicated to that, to the organizations I think are doing the best job.
[02:55:12.955 --> 02:55:14.356]  And I got a pretty good eye on that.
[02:55:15.957 --> 02:55:17.378]  Look at the crew we've assembled over the years.
[02:55:17.398 --> 02:55:18.079]  Just great people.
[02:55:18.119 --> 02:55:18.519]  So here's the thing.
[02:55:18.539 --> 02:55:19.700]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:21.021]  I want to thank you for your prayers.
[02:55:21.041 --> 02:55:23.583]  I want you to remember, you're awake, but a lot of people aren't.
[02:55:24.003 --> 02:55:24.864]  Share those articles.
[02:55:24.904 --> 02:55:25.585]  Share those videos.
[02:55:25.885 --> 02:55:26.665]  Start your own show.
[02:55:26.685 --> 02:55:27.746]  Whatever you do, take action.
[02:55:28.026 --> 02:55:37.234]  But getting back to products, DNA Force Plus is the PQQ, the CoQ10, and a bunch of other key things that are known to detoxify your cells.
[02:55:38.848 --> 02:55:44.374]  They don't lengthen telomeres, they just slow their shortening, which is essentially the same thing.
[02:55:45.896 --> 02:55:47.137]  There's all the studies behind it.
[02:55:48.679 --> 02:55:49.500]  Telomere support.
[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:52.263]  It's got so much research behind it.
[02:55:52.343 --> 02:55:54.586]  Go look at it for yourself at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:54.606 --> 02:55:55.387]  Go look at the studies.
[02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:58.070]  Go it yourself.
[02:56:00.413 --> 02:56:11.077]  Elephant ATP, Ancient Peat, Apple Extract, PQQ, CoQ10, Organic Reishi, Astragalus, Root Extract, and even more incredible ingredients.
[02:56:12.677 --> 02:56:16.359]  Now we got it for cheaper price ingredients with bigger runs.
[02:56:16.999 --> 02:56:18.419]  We can lower the price massively.
[02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:19.740]  The regular retail being $150, now $120.
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:20.820]  It is 50% off right now.
[02:56:20.860 --> 02:56:21.260]  It's regular price $74.
[02:56:26.613 --> 02:56:29.936]  And I mean, we're talking $45, $50 a product.
[02:56:30.236 --> 02:56:33.438]  You add the marketing, everything else into it, we're making like $20 on this baby.
[02:56:33.939 --> 02:56:34.919]  But nobody does that.
[02:56:34.939 --> 02:56:37.281]  Everybody else has a 500 to 700% markup.
[02:56:38.182 --> 02:56:39.703]  It's a good deal at 100% markup.
[02:56:40.143 --> 02:56:44.246]  It's 50% off right now, which is unbelievable.
[02:56:44.907 --> 02:56:46.268]  Try it for yourself, your family.
[02:56:46.948 --> 02:56:47.469]  It's amazing.
[02:56:48.810 --> 02:56:53.393]  Also, Super Mel Vitality is 50% off, and you can get Alpha Power that's so super popular.
[02:56:53.633 --> 02:56:55.014]  The two go together like a horse and carriage.
[02:56:55.034 --> 02:56:55.835]  They're both very strong.
[02:56:57.546 --> 02:57:01.991]  Super Male is cold-pressed, a lot of the same ingredients, but then it has a different effect.
[02:57:02.031 --> 02:57:04.754]  It's not as strong, but it's cold-pressed, so it's, again, apples and oranges.
[02:57:05.775 --> 02:57:07.497]  The Alpha Power is a lot higher dosage.
[02:57:07.537 --> 02:57:11.060]  It's a lot of the same amazing compounds, but it's organic, but it's powdered.
[02:57:13.102 --> 02:57:13.903]  So they're both there.
[02:57:14.564 --> 02:57:16.106]  A lot of folks think Alpha Power is stronger.
[02:57:16.326 --> 02:57:17.187]  Try it out for yourself.
[02:57:17.387 --> 02:57:19.349]  Stamina, energy, libido, it's amazing.
[02:57:19.469 --> 02:57:19.970]  Alpha Power.
[02:57:21.155 --> 02:57:24.317]  50% off when you get up with Supermail Vitality and free shipping on that combo.
[02:57:24.798 --> 02:57:28.260]  Or get them individually, 50% off Supermail Alpha Power, 25% off.

[02:57:36.746 --> 02:57:37.586]  They're all amazing.

[02:57:39.227 --> 02:57:44.291]  As bad as I treat my body and all the work I do with the stress, it makes me lazy how great these products are.
[02:57:44.351 --> 02:57:46.252]  It's just amazing.
[02:57:46.532 --> 02:57:47.493]  It's life-changing.
[02:57:47.893 --> 02:57:49.775]  Infoworkstore.com, and it's a 360 win.
[02:57:52.543 --> 02:57:53.964]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:57:54.124 --> 02:57:56.545]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[02:57:56.725 --> 02:58:04.027]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[02:58:14.851 --> 02:58:22.415]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:58:22.695 --> 02:58:32.660]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:58:32.900 --> 02:58:34.821]  And this part is most important.
[02:58:34.941 --> 02:58:41.424]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[02:58:41.764 --> 02:58:42.807]  That means it's clean.
[02:58:43.207 --> 02:58:44.189]  That means it's pure.
[02:58:44.330 --> 02:58:47.035]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:58:47.235 --> 02:58:49.841]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:50.021 --> 02:58:51.664]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:58:53.123 --> 02:58:53.844]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:53.864 --> 02:59:03.470]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:09.254]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:59:09.574 --> 02:59:12.376]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:59:12.596 --> 02:59:21.342]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:59:23.463 --> 02:59:42.548]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:59:43.048 --> 02:59:44.348]  It is amazing!
[02:59:45.749 --> 02:59:50.710]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:59:54.850 --> 03:00:00.815]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:15.828]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[03:00:16.349 --> 03:00:19.031]  He is Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:30.222]  I'm going to hand the baton to former prosecutor, syndicated TV and radio host, Lionel, from Lionel Media right now, but I just wanted to bring this up.
[03:00:30.242 --> 03:00:38.145]  I haven't really gotten into Mueller and the raid too much because we know where this is going.
[03:00:38.225 --> 03:00:39.045]  It's totally criminal.
[03:00:39.085 --> 03:00:39.845]  It's totally lawless.
[03:00:39.885 --> 03:00:40.826]  It's a giant dragnet.
[03:00:40.846 --> 03:00:43.987]  You have Mueller up to his eyeballs in Uranium One, Hillary.
[03:00:44.047 --> 03:00:44.907]  I mean, it's a joke.
[03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:46.488]  It's foxes watching the henhouse.
[03:00:47.308 --> 03:00:50.709]  And the cowards all around Trump and Sessions and all of it.
[03:00:52.014 --> 03:00:56.257]  It's a nightmare situation, and they're going to try a fake indictment of the President, which will just embarrass him.
[03:00:56.277 --> 03:00:57.738]  There's three branches of government.
[03:00:58.159 --> 03:01:01.441]  They think the public's dumb, so they're going to say, why isn't he stepping down?
[03:01:04.764 --> 03:01:17.013]  But I haven't covered it much because it's really up to the President to get hardcore, and not just call Mueller a criminal and Comey a criminal, but to fire Sessions and put somebody in there.
[03:01:17.113 --> 03:01:21.737]  It's the executive branch, by the way, that'll start the indictments because we've got them open and shut.
[03:01:24.821 --> 03:01:27.682]  But again, we've got this stagnant, cowardly country at the top.
[03:01:28.302 --> 03:01:34.925]  Just like the Project Veritas videos you just saw with people saying, we cover up teachers assaulting kids, we cover them up having sex with little girls.
[03:01:37.846 --> 03:01:40.387]  That's what runs this country now, from the bottom to the top.
[03:01:41.628 --> 03:01:43.949]  Republicans can be corrupt too, but they're nothing like Democrats.
[03:01:44.529 --> 03:01:46.090]  Democrats are a special breed.
[03:01:47.489 --> 03:01:51.971]  Lionel, I got one more little clip I want to play of the, because you're a lawyer and a prosecutor.
[03:01:52.991 --> 03:01:53.932]  I looked at HIPAA rules.
[03:01:54.012 --> 03:01:54.672]  I have employees.
[03:01:55.252 --> 03:01:56.873]  I've been through divorces, you know, divorce.
[03:01:56.913 --> 03:01:57.913]  I know about HIPAA.
[03:01:58.754 --> 03:02:02.455]  And I know that you can go to any doctor you want and demand your medical records, the hard copies.
[03:02:03.616 --> 03:02:04.676]  So I want to hit this after the break.
[03:02:05.456 --> 03:02:08.158]  His doctor says he feels rape because Trump took his medical records.
[03:02:08.818 --> 03:02:12.439]  And he's sitting there changing his story now that Trump wrote the letter, which he says he wrote.
[03:02:12.999 --> 03:02:13.920]  So he has no credibility.
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:15.380]  But let me ask you that in the next segment, just briefly.
[03:02:17.785 --> 03:02:30.752]  You're a former prosecutor, you can speak better to this, but just watching this train wreck, and this rogue element of government, I know the branches of government, and to watch the media act like Mueller is his own fourth branch, am I wrong in what I said, or am I right, or what do you want to add to that?
[03:02:32.133 --> 03:02:33.173]  Absolutely.
[03:02:33.193 --> 03:02:37.696]  I was just thinking, did somebody, did somebody connect my brain?
[03:02:37.716 --> 03:02:39.117]  This is what I was saying today.
[03:02:40.538 --> 03:02:42.379]  I got news for the world.
[03:02:42.719 --> 03:02:52.444]  Look, I love Sean Hannity and Rudy Giuliani's a great guy and a great friend and a great person, but this is not a substitute for prosecution.
[03:02:52.784 --> 03:02:53.744]  This is terrific.
[03:02:54.024 --> 03:03:00.767]  And every day when I hear about somebody saying, TikTok and Hillary does this and Hillary does this, well, damn it, do something.
[03:03:01.167 --> 03:03:05.469]  And the president is not only the commander in chief, but he is the head of the executive.
[03:03:05.509 --> 03:03:08.411]  He can walk in and say, whoever has a job,
[03:03:09.031 --> 03:03:13.513]  He can walk into the DOJ and say, whoever has a job, take one step forward.
[03:03:13.793 --> 03:03:15.213]  Not so fast, Sessions!
[03:03:15.533 --> 03:03:16.214]  You're out!
[03:03:16.634 --> 03:03:17.794]  Rosenstein, out!
[03:03:18.555 --> 03:03:19.615]  All of you, out!
[03:03:20.075 --> 03:03:20.555]  Gone!
[03:03:20.775 --> 03:03:21.256]  Through!
[03:03:21.916 --> 03:03:27.938]  I want to find out, are you going to charge Hillary Clinton with something?
[03:03:28.098 --> 03:03:29.699]  That's either a yes or a no.
[03:03:29.939 --> 03:03:32.360]  Because Alex, she's the canary in the judicial coal mine.
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:35.901]  If she's not charged, look, how many times a week
[03:03:36.448 --> 03:03:43.771]  Do you hear of some poor, mistaken person thrown away for 30 years on some trumped-up rape charge?
[03:03:44.131 --> 03:04:01.717]  We jump on people for the most monumentally insignificant crimes, we throw people away, we don't care about jurisprudence, but we're so afraid to charge Hillary with something because... That's because she knows where the bodies are buried.
[03:04:02.725 --> 03:04:04.947]  Precisely, precisely.
[03:04:05.327 --> 03:04:06.408]  And here's the thing, too.
[03:04:06.989 --> 03:04:15.937]  This may be terrific, but Rudy Giuliani, again, whom I respect on so many levels, did he understand the script last night?
[03:04:16.438 --> 03:04:16.898]  What is he?
[03:04:17.178 --> 03:04:21.502]  Did he understand he threw Trump under the bus by saying, oh, yeah, we knew all about the payoff?
[03:04:21.522 --> 03:04:22.003]  Yeah, he did it.
[03:04:22.463 --> 03:04:22.884]  Wait a minute.
[03:04:22.904 --> 03:04:23.244]  Hold it.
[03:04:23.284 --> 03:04:23.985]  What do you do?
[03:04:24.065 --> 03:04:25.346]  Do you talk to each other?
[03:04:25.906 --> 03:04:32.012]  You're, you're, I mean, and I can't say it enough, I love the man, but even they don't know how to do it.
[03:04:32.253 --> 03:04:34.775]  Why are we going through so many in-house counsels?
[03:04:34.875 --> 03:04:43.204]  And if you think flood isn't going to be subject to some kind of motion to recuse or conflict of interest, you don't think the Clintons are going to be saying, wait a minute, you're helping him?
[03:04:43.464 --> 03:04:45.065]  Well, walk us through this.
[03:04:45.145 --> 03:04:45.966]  Walk us through this.
[03:04:46.086 --> 03:04:47.167]  And we'll play the Giuliani clips.
[03:04:47.207 --> 03:04:51.671]  And then the doctor saying he was raped because Trump got his medical records.
[03:04:52.011 --> 03:04:57.155]  When the doctor released that he was on Propecia, that violated HIPAA and federal law.
[03:04:57.515 --> 03:04:58.136]  We'll be back.
[03:05:03.214 --> 03:05:06.396]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:05:06.856 --> 03:05:08.177]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:05:08.657 --> 03:05:20.085]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:05:20.885 --> 03:05:29.792]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:05:30.192 --> 03:05:36.056]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:05:36.276 --> 03:05:40.900]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:43.741]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:05:44.081 --> 03:05:45.421]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:05:45.821 --> 03:05:55.424]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:05:55.525 --> 03:05:57.685]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:05:58.225 --> 03:06:03.087]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[03:06:13.906 --> 03:06:16.047]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:16.527 --> 03:06:17.868]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:18.268 --> 03:06:32.715]  Lionel of LionelMedia.com, syndicated TV host, radio host, massively successful on YouTube and Twitter.
[03:06:40.618 --> 03:06:42.520]  is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:45.522]  And soon we're hiring more board ops, more producers.
[03:06:45.542 --> 03:06:47.183]  I want to talk to Lionel and a bunch of the people.
[03:06:47.203 --> 03:06:51.186]  We just keep waiting and waiting because it's the process of hiring and training and finishing the studios.
[03:06:51.486 --> 03:06:54.849]  We're very close trying to launch new programs, new syndications.
[03:06:55.029 --> 03:06:57.091]  And I'm very excited.
[03:06:57.111 --> 03:07:00.894]  We've gotten over 300 TV stations and cable networks.
[03:07:02.501 --> 03:07:05.222]  It's over 300 stations and something like 60, 70 cable networks.
[03:07:05.763 --> 03:07:08.524]  And that sounds big, but there's thousands across the country.
[03:07:08.744 --> 03:07:09.364]  And it is big.
[03:07:09.944 --> 03:07:13.026]  Some of them are main stations, other ones are sub, you know, digital stations.
[03:07:13.046 --> 03:07:14.566]  They have extra stations now, whole feeds.
[03:07:14.987 --> 03:07:16.647]  You know, Channel 9 in Houston.
[03:07:17.608 --> 03:07:19.309]  Phone-a-scope, 24 hours a day.
[03:07:19.329 --> 03:07:21.710]  I mean, we've been on there a couple years, but now we're 24 hours a day.
[03:07:24.171 --> 03:07:30.514]  We've gotten over 100 TV stations the last two weeks, so we've got a lot of new radio affiliates, but we never get above about 260 or so.
[03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:33.282]  And a lot of them are giant.
[03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:34.663]  Some of them are 50,000 watt AMs.
[03:07:34.683 --> 03:07:35.203]  They're wonderful.
[03:07:35.263 --> 03:07:37.425]  But the TV is going better than I thought.
[03:07:37.545 --> 03:07:38.505]  So that's very, very exciting.
[03:07:38.545 --> 03:07:42.788]  So I want to try to work with a lot of folks and launch some new broadcasts, hopefully with Lionel in the near future.
[03:07:42.808 --> 03:07:50.093]  But I wanted to just selfishly, because I know he's a really smart prosecutor and author and so much more, get into this.
[03:07:50.154 --> 03:07:56.298]  But when you read the news for 23 years and you study this, you go through things, you start to learn how the branches of government and law work.
[03:07:57.765 --> 03:08:03.610]  And you see Clinton, day one, he gets in, he fires 90-something federal prosecutors and U.S.
[03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:04.511]  attorneys.
[03:08:04.531 --> 03:08:07.333]  And then anytime an attorney general doesn't do what he wants, boom, you're fired.
[03:08:07.393 --> 03:08:09.595]  It's just like, oh, the media's like, of course, that's his right to do it.
[03:08:11.177 --> 03:08:13.979]  Trump, they build it up where you can't fire anybody.
[03:08:14.019 --> 03:08:15.540]  And Rosenstein can do whatever he wants.
[03:08:15.580 --> 03:08:18.143]  And then it turns out Rosenstein's involved in the cover-up.
[03:08:19.747 --> 03:08:27.790]  Uranium One, and protection of the Clintons, and they're involved in the fake dossier, and CNN's getting awards at the press dinner for the dossier reporting.
[03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:31.231]  It's like a Monty Python skit.
[03:08:31.831 --> 03:08:32.871]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:08:33.051 --> 03:08:44.355]  And so, all the corruptions there, you know, all the things Hillary done, the servers, and Uranium One, and Haiti scams, and 84 million laundered money all confirmed in the foundation, out of billions.
[03:08:45.874 --> 03:08:54.982]  And then it's all Stormy Daniels, a woman got $130,000, and then Giuliani's like, well, it wasn't from campaign money, so that doesn't matter.
[03:08:55.782 --> 03:09:04.410]  Like, he's trying to dynamite the oil field fire with another explosion, and then all that does is explode even crazier, and meanwhile,
[03:09:06.748 --> 03:09:08.269]  They're trying to take us to war again.
[03:09:08.690 --> 03:09:10.551]  We've got all this crazy stuff happening.
[03:09:11.232 --> 03:09:19.238]  And I know Trump's approval rating, even though they try to skew it downward with oversampling Democrats, it's doubled in its support from black males.
[03:09:19.618 --> 03:09:20.699]  It's up in black females.
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:25.703]  In a lot of polls, he's 55%, even though they're oversampling 15 points Democrats.
[03:09:26.123 --> 03:09:27.845]  So Trump's super popular.
[03:09:27.885 --> 03:09:28.886]  The economy's coming back.
[03:09:29.406 --> 03:09:30.748]  He's a very pragmatic president.
[03:09:30.788 --> 03:09:33.191]  I wouldn't even call him a Republican, but just an Americana guy.
[03:09:33.531 --> 03:09:36.454]  And the left just gets more insane, more crazy.
[03:09:36.494 --> 03:09:44.624]  They talk with, like, worshipful... I used to get a little sicked out by men talking about quarterbacks worshipfully and getting little twinkles in their eyes.
[03:09:45.705 --> 03:09:46.606]  It wasn't even that it was gay.
[03:09:46.626 --> 03:09:47.447]  It was just worshipful.
[03:09:47.467 --> 03:09:48.128]  It was kind of sick.
[03:09:48.348 --> 03:09:49.069]  You know, I like football.
[03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.631]  This is beyond that.
[03:09:50.651 --> 03:09:54.875]  I've never seen media sycophantic like, Mueller's coming, Mueller's gonna get you.
[03:09:55.215 --> 03:09:56.016]  Oh, Mueller.
[03:09:56.816 --> 03:10:02.762]  Since when do the left just worship raw state rogue power, runaway special counsel?
[03:10:03.222 --> 03:10:11.529]  And so at this point, Trump not firing Sessions, which is the real problem there, and Rosenstein, for me, it's Trump dereliction of duty.
[03:10:11.749 --> 03:10:15.213]  He wants to act tough and he's made some big moves, done great on North Korea and things.
[03:10:15.613 --> 03:10:16.374]  I want to believe that.
[03:10:16.874 --> 03:10:21.378]  But when there's dereliction of duty, that it's his office, he's in charge, these people are completely rogue.
[03:10:21.778 --> 03:10:25.041]  I gotta start blaming President Trump instead of just blaming the Attorney General.
[03:10:25.301 --> 03:10:26.582]  What do you say as an expert on this?
[03:10:27.403 --> 03:10:27.964]  Let me say something.
[03:10:28.124 --> 03:10:38.072]  The thing you just said right now, Alex, nobody's ever gonna remember because they're gonna call you some sycophantic lickspittle, some bootlicker, some toady, some fawning, you know, Trump acolyte.
[03:10:38.413 --> 03:10:39.934]  And what you just said is what I've said.
[03:10:40.254 --> 03:10:41.936]  Look, this man works for me.
[03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:44.031]  He's my president.
[03:10:44.391 --> 03:10:47.053]  I'm not his slave, his serf, his acolyte.
[03:10:47.073 --> 03:10:47.994]  It doesn't work like that.
[03:10:48.574 --> 03:10:50.355]  His foreign policy is schizophrenic.
[03:10:50.595 --> 03:10:51.896]  I don't even know what he's talking about.
[03:10:51.916 --> 03:11:02.704]  The whole thing about Syria, the whole Skripal poisoning, he's talking about he's going up to a superpower, a nuclear superpower, sticking his thumb in his eye, and then expecting me to sit back and applaud him.
[03:11:03.044 --> 03:11:03.805]  I don't understand that.
[03:11:03.825 --> 03:11:06.987]  And by the way, Stormy Daniels is here for one reason.
[03:11:07.207 --> 03:11:09.709]  As we see more and more information about North Korea, which
[03:11:10.692 --> 03:11:23.479]  Alex, if I ever told you, if I went into this before the President was elected, and I said, one day he's going to bring peace to North Korea, you'd look at me like I was high or something.
[03:11:23.699 --> 03:11:24.260]  And he did it.
[03:11:24.580 --> 03:11:29.483]  No mention of the Nobel Prize, no mention about anything that's going on, prisoner exchange, no Stormy Daniels.
[03:11:29.863 --> 03:11:35.126]  So, what he's doing right now is, the only firing that's going on is his own legal counsel.
[03:11:35.706 --> 03:11:36.647]  What's that all about?
[03:11:36.887 --> 03:11:37.868]  I don't understand this.
[03:11:38.108 --> 03:11:40.110]  It gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing.
[03:11:40.430 --> 03:11:44.253]  By the way, we spent so much time on this Michelle Wolf story, for God's sake.
[03:11:44.473 --> 03:11:46.355]  I mean, that was interesting, kind of.
[03:11:46.855 --> 03:11:56.563]  But it seems like the mainstream media, the corporate sock puppet Ted Baxter, the echo chamber cookie cutter, you know, bumper sticker media, they love low-hanging fruit.
[03:11:57.043 --> 03:11:58.584]  They love things that are easy to decide.
[03:11:58.805 --> 03:12:01.767]  And look at this, this Avenatti, this, this, this lawyer.
[03:12:01.787 --> 03:12:04.089]  Photobombing, photobombing on, I mean, just a little creep.
[03:12:05.029 --> 03:12:09.314]  Look at what, and CNN basically has had him on, what, 59 times?
[03:12:09.714 --> 03:12:12.557]  You know, there was a time, Alex, in the old days when CNN was it.
[03:12:12.857 --> 03:12:15.100]  The only time you go to CNN is when there's a plane crash.
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:23.309]  Where Don Lemon will ask you whether there's a possibility that the Malaysian plane was sucked up into a black hole in our own atmosphere.
[03:12:23.589 --> 03:12:24.450]  Well, let's go back to this.
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:27.601]  The President owns all of this.
[03:12:27.661 --> 03:12:29.381]  The Department of Justice is his.
[03:12:29.921 --> 03:12:36.823]  And for some reason, we have reconstructed this notion of the superstructure and the hierarchy, and we've made it sound like, oh, no, no.
[03:12:37.283 --> 03:12:39.563]  If he fires who?
[03:12:39.843 --> 03:12:43.224]  Sessions or Mueller or whoever, it's grounds for impeachment.
[03:12:43.584 --> 03:12:45.525]  Impeachment is just a charge.
[03:12:45.965 --> 03:12:46.365]  If you get 51
[03:12:48.025 --> 03:12:50.847]  Senators, or percent rather, in the House.
[03:12:51.327 --> 03:12:55.269]  You can impeach him for being gluten intolerant.
[03:12:55.709 --> 03:12:56.710]  It doesn't matter.
[03:12:56.990 --> 03:13:02.773]  And let's be clear, the Democrats announced yesterday, got almost no attention, it was in the Hill, they're going to run on impeachment.
[03:13:03.153 --> 03:13:04.153]  That's their policy.
[03:13:04.173 --> 03:13:06.735]  And if Trump was failing on the economy and stuff, it might work.
[03:13:06.795 --> 03:13:10.697]  This is so obstructionist, so insane, so out of control.
[03:13:10.797 --> 03:13:13.738]  And then shifting gears, we've got his lawyer.
[03:13:14.059 --> 03:13:15.479]  And let's cue that up.
[03:13:17.538 --> 03:13:24.428]  Well, first let's go to Giuliani, who's also his lawyer, and if we're looking at this, they're saying that
[03:13:25.489 --> 03:13:27.530]  Giuliani was going to come in and fix things in two weeks.
[03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:32.292]  Well now we're three weeks later and it looks to me like I don't know what Giuliani's doing.
[03:13:32.332 --> 03:13:34.333]  It's like you said, we don't know what's going on.
[03:13:34.573 --> 03:13:42.457]  I know why he's firing a bunch of his lawyers because they told him it'd be over by Christmas and it'd be over by April and that Mueller wasn't going to go for obstruction and that Mueller wasn't that bad.
[03:13:42.737 --> 03:13:48.819]  Well now Trump knows that he was advised right by Roger Stone and myself and others that the whole time they are coming after him.
[03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:49.720]  Can you speak to that?
[03:13:50.953 --> 03:13:53.055]  Well, the thing is that Rudy was supposed to come in.
[03:13:53.355 --> 03:14:07.807]  Rudy was sold as follows, that Rudy knows how things work, that Rudy is respected in the Department of Justice, that he can make connections and he has avenues and he has a way in that other people just don't have.
[03:14:07.887 --> 03:14:08.808]  That's the way it was sold.
[03:14:09.228 --> 03:14:17.715]  But just by virtue of the appearance last night with Sean Hannity, first of all, referring to Comey as some kind of a pervert, that doesn't help anything.
[03:14:18.015 --> 03:14:19.957]  It also gave the people the impression
[03:14:20.763 --> 03:14:28.607]  That it was scatter shot, it was slip shot, it was a cluster attack of nothing.
[03:14:29.207 --> 03:14:30.527]  I can't say this enough.
[03:14:31.268 --> 03:14:37.891]  What people need to understand is how profoundly unconstitutional everything is.
[03:14:38.251 --> 03:14:39.411]  I mean everything.
[03:14:39.472 --> 03:14:40.312]  It's not merely
[03:14:41.778 --> 03:15:00.769]  It's not, how do I say this, it's not just unfair, but what Mueller has been doing, going back to dossier, going back to, do you realize, let me just give you this, so far we only have in terms of indictments, Alex, we have what, four, technically, Manafort and Gates, who by the way predated Trump, that was Ukraine, that was before.
[03:15:00.789 --> 03:15:02.250]  And they're all process issues.
[03:15:03.343 --> 03:15:03.603]  Right.
[03:15:03.643 --> 03:15:06.426]  It was about banking and it was about reporting and that sort of thing.
[03:15:06.446 --> 03:15:10.069]  Then we have Flynn and Papadopoulos.
[03:15:10.450 --> 03:15:13.492]  Flynn, by the way, is most probably going to have his plea withdrawn.
[03:15:13.733 --> 03:15:14.654]  And let me tell you something.
[03:15:15.114 --> 03:15:21.920]  In the world of juridical handicapping, having a plea withdrawn, you never do it.
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:22.781]  It never happens.
[03:15:23.081 --> 03:15:24.122]  There's a certainty to it.
[03:15:24.342 --> 03:15:26.885]  But the judge even signaled, I know what you're doing.
[03:15:26.945 --> 03:15:28.346]  So, that's Flynn.
[03:15:28.667 --> 03:15:31.189]  And the other indictments are these 13 bots.
[03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:33.532]  Remember these Russians that nobody heard of?
[03:15:33.832 --> 03:15:34.493]  Nobody knew?
[03:15:35.193 --> 03:15:41.299]  And it came on the Friday after the FBI was told, why didn't you follow up when we warned you about that shooter in Florida?
[03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:42.721]  That's all they've got so far!
[03:15:44.230 --> 03:15:49.212]  Exactly, and they're cornered rats that know they've committed all these crimes, so they're just committed to keep going.
[03:15:49.232 --> 03:15:51.012]  I want to hear your prediction of how this all ends.
[03:15:51.392 --> 03:15:55.674]  Currently, we'll play those Giuliani clips, and then the doctor saying he got raped by Trump.
[03:15:55.694 --> 03:15:57.234]  I mean, this is the most insane.
[03:15:57.454 --> 03:16:00.235]  So now he's part of the Me Too movement, because Trump got his medical records.
[03:16:05.209 --> 03:16:07.690]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:10.850]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:13.191]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[03:16:13.811 --> 03:16:15.272]  What is the latest from the UK?
[03:16:15.392 --> 03:16:23.934]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[03:16:23.954 --> 03:16:28.155]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[03:16:28.195 --> 03:16:31.076]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[03:16:31.156 --> 03:16:32.496]  It would have been mad!
[03:16:33.096 --> 03:16:40.800]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:43.241]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[03:16:43.821 --> 03:16:45.562]  Trust Middle England.
[03:16:45.983 --> 03:16:47.423]  Trust Middle America.
[03:16:47.443 --> 03:16:51.225]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[03:16:51.565 --> 03:16:55.447]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[03:16:56.007 --> 03:16:56.888]  All I can tell her
[03:16:57.648 --> 03:17:06.276]  ...is be careful, because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[03:17:06.436 --> 03:17:07.317]  Let's put it like this.
[03:17:07.878 --> 03:17:21.010]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally, don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago were on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[03:17:23.011 --> 03:17:35.845]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[03:17:35.885 --> 03:17:38.028]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[03:17:38.168 --> 03:17:39.289]  You're a leading expert on this.
[03:17:39.369 --> 03:17:41.251]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[03:17:41.492 --> 03:17:42.433]  Why are they trying to flood?
[03:17:43.459 --> 03:17:44.639]  Because they hate Christianity.
[03:17:45.279 --> 03:17:56.242]  They can't, I mean, you know, they deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[03:17:56.282 --> 03:17:57.102]  They deny that.
[03:17:57.542 --> 03:18:01.223]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[03:18:01.263 --> 03:18:02.443]  They want to get rid of it.
[03:18:02.964 --> 03:18:10.905]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[03:18:11.166 --> 03:18:12.966]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[03:18:13.698 --> 03:18:18.900]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[03:18:18.960 --> 03:18:24.962]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[03:18:25.262 --> 03:18:33.545]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[03:18:33.585 --> 03:18:39.327]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[03:18:39.367 --> 03:18:40.527]  And look, what's really happening here?
[03:18:41.047 --> 03:18:42.848]  You know, don't underestimate
[03:18:43.448 --> 03:18:46.410]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[03:18:46.430 --> 03:18:47.811]  The victory of Brexit.
[03:18:48.091 --> 03:18:49.012]  The victory of Trump.
[03:18:49.632 --> 03:18:50.493]  You know, we're winning.
[03:18:50.833 --> 03:18:51.894]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[03:18:52.134 --> 03:18:59.759]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[03:18:59.839 --> 03:19:00.640]  And you know something?
[03:19:01.180 --> 03:19:01.981]  If we can resist,
[03:19:02.785 --> 03:19:11.891]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[03:19:11.951 --> 03:19:13.672]  So don't get down, everybody.
[03:19:13.972 --> 03:19:14.833]  Don't get depressed.
[03:19:15.173 --> 03:19:17.655]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[03:19:18.496 --> 03:19:24.261]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops.
[03:19:24.581 --> 03:19:27.404]  And you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[03:19:27.664 --> 03:19:28.324]  You're amazing.
[03:19:28.545 --> 03:19:29.245]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:19:29.285 --> 03:19:30.106]  I know you're very busy.
[03:19:30.686 --> 03:19:32.048]  But that's as the EU has said.
[03:19:32.088 --> 03:19:34.570]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[03:19:34.610 --> 03:19:37.993]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[03:19:39.216 --> 03:19:51.886]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[03:19:52.266 --> 03:19:55.648]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity.
[03:19:56.029 --> 03:19:57.710]  And we must protect it.
[03:19:58.230 --> 03:19:59.611]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[03:20:05.596 --> 03:20:08.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:27.538 --> 03:20:30.521]  And you said the money was not campaign money.
[03:20:31.422 --> 03:20:33.624]  I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know.
[03:20:33.704 --> 03:20:36.087]  It's not campaign money, no campaign violation.
[03:20:36.107 --> 03:20:38.509]  And I said because they funneled through a law firm.
[03:20:38.629 --> 03:20:41.031]  I think we were talking about two different things there.
[03:20:41.071 --> 03:20:41.672]  I want to make sure.
[03:20:41.752 --> 03:20:47.357]  I was talking about the $130,000 payment, the settlement payment, which is a very regular thing for lawyers to do.
[03:20:48.118 --> 03:21:01.508]  The question there was, the only possible violation there would be, was it a campaign finance violation, which usually would result in a fine by the way, not this big storm troopers coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking down his office.
[03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:04.330]  That was money that was paid
[03:21:05.251 --> 03:21:11.416]  By his lawyer, the way I would do out of his law firm funds, or whatever funds, doesn't matter.
[03:21:11.817 --> 03:21:13.979]  The president reimbursed that over a period of several months.
[03:21:13.999 --> 03:21:18.743]  He had said, I distinctly remember, that he did it on his own.
[03:21:19.003 --> 03:21:19.323]  He did?
[03:21:19.884 --> 03:21:20.725]  Without asking.
[03:21:20.765 --> 03:21:21.445]  Look, I don't know.
[03:21:21.725 --> 03:21:22.706]  I haven't investigated that.
[03:21:23.803 --> 03:21:24.864]  No reason to dispute that.
[03:21:25.244 --> 03:21:26.505]  No reason to dispute his recollection.
[03:21:27.266 --> 03:21:28.227]  I like Michael a lot.
[03:21:28.707 --> 03:21:29.928]  Listen, here's the deal, folks.
[03:21:30.789 --> 03:21:33.271]  We didn't elect a guy that's a saint when it comes to women.
[03:21:33.311 --> 03:21:35.873]  We all know he likes to run beauty pageants, okay?
[03:21:36.774 --> 03:21:39.036]  So, we didn't elect him for that.
[03:21:39.056 --> 03:21:41.218]  We didn't think we were electing the first Baptist minister here.
[03:21:41.918 --> 03:21:44.681]  The woman didn't even allege abuse 11 years ago.
[03:21:45.401 --> 03:21:47.864]  She has shown herself to be a horrible political tool.
[03:21:49.105 --> 03:21:57.950]  Following the president around, basically stalking him, in my view, politically, and dancing in whatever town the president's at, outside Mar-a-Lago, which is her right to do.
[03:21:59.471 --> 03:22:11.919]  She has her lawyer photobombing everybody, but pulling back from this, you've got Lionel here, who's a former prosecutor, syndicated talk show host, and really a very articulate, smart guy on this front.
[03:22:13.863 --> 03:22:16.765]  What is the point of him going out and saying that?
[03:22:32.014 --> 03:22:34.756]  Okay, you just asked about 20 different things and they were all good.
[03:22:34.816 --> 03:22:36.177]  Let me start with this one right now.
[03:22:36.357 --> 03:22:37.698]  Let me give you a fact pattern.
[03:23:02.321 --> 03:23:09.324]  Let's assume that at some particular point, Donald Trump spoke to an FBI agent, somebody in the federal government.
[03:23:10.145 --> 03:23:12.326]  And there's this wonderful statute called 18 U.S.C.
[03:23:12.586 --> 03:23:12.326]  1001.
[03:23:12.966 --> 03:23:17.108]  And it basically says, you lied to the federal government, that's it.
[03:23:17.288 --> 03:23:21.610]  Not under oath necessarily, not in a grand jury, but the way they got Martha Stewart.
[03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:24.512]  Martha Stewart was never put away for, you know, insider trading.
[03:23:24.532 --> 03:23:25.412]  It was because she lied.
[03:23:26.152 --> 03:23:27.033]  Now let's assume
[03:23:28.189 --> 03:23:29.870]  After, remember what happened just now.
[03:23:30.231 --> 03:23:33.353]  Trump told somebody, the FBI agent, we don't know who he's talked to.
[03:23:34.133 --> 03:23:35.994]  He said, no, no, I knew nothing about this.
[03:23:36.855 --> 03:23:38.216]  Michael Cohen on his own.
[03:23:38.476 --> 03:23:41.218]  Think about this, on his own, without even telling me.
[03:23:41.518 --> 03:23:42.339]  Whoever does this.
[03:23:42.659 --> 03:23:46.302]  Imagine me being your lawyer and I say, don't tell Alex, but I'm going to pay this.
[03:23:46.682 --> 03:23:50.665]  And by the way, I'm going to get a second mortgage on my house.
[03:23:50.685 --> 03:23:55.528]  I'm going to refinance my house to pay for this amount.
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:01.710]  I'm a millionaire, but I need to refinance my house to pay for this that you don't know about.
[03:24:02.812 --> 03:24:04.675]  I did this without you knowing it.
[03:24:05.276 --> 03:24:05.437]  Now...
[03:24:06.198 --> 03:24:09.679]  Trump, let's assume, later on says, hey look, I knew nothing about this.
[03:24:10.239 --> 03:24:18.942]  And let's assume... Yeah, you could argue it was Cohen, and I'm not saying Cohen did this, setting Trump up, doing that, getting in his business to pay somebody off.
[03:24:19.162 --> 03:24:20.543]  And we all know that's not what happened.
[03:24:20.843 --> 03:24:23.003]  We all know at a gut level, he's the president's lawyer.
[03:24:23.283 --> 03:24:24.424]  Lawyers take care of stuff.
[03:24:24.644 --> 03:24:25.544]  You trust your lawyer.
[03:24:25.844 --> 03:24:27.085]  Later they go, hey, I did this.
[03:24:27.185 --> 03:24:27.465]  Boom.
[03:24:27.505 --> 03:24:28.225]  That's how it works.
[03:24:28.585 --> 03:24:29.305]  It's not illegal.
[03:24:29.325 --> 03:24:30.526]  You're taking care of something.
[03:24:30.786 --> 03:24:34.407]  But you're saying, process, if Cohen's lied about anything, that's how they'll get him.
[03:24:35.168 --> 03:24:36.309]  Well, what about this?
[03:24:36.589 --> 03:24:37.590]  What if Trump lies?
[03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:41.572]  What if they use Giuliani's statement right now on the Sean Hannity Show?
[03:24:42.193 --> 03:24:46.376]  Use that as a basis to charge Trump with perjury or the violation of the statute.
[03:24:46.736 --> 03:24:54.041]  Because the reason why you take the Fifth Amendment, Alex, you can go into a grand jury or a setting and you can be given, you know, under oath or whatever it is.
[03:24:54.725 --> 03:24:59.351]  You can speak the truth, but if somebody else contradicts what you're saying, that could be the charge of perjury.
[03:24:59.571 --> 03:25:05.679]  So because they don't even have the story straight... No, I get it, and he should plead the fitches because it's self-incrimination, but here's the problem.
[03:25:06.789 --> 03:25:13.051]  The president is the head of the executive, as you know, or you'd always have some other grand jury or some group rogue trying to take him down.
[03:25:13.271 --> 03:25:18.052]  That's why only an indictment in the House, a conviction in the Senate can remove the president.
[03:25:18.372 --> 03:25:24.454]  So it's all just exactly the president needs to act like the president and his lawyers, we know, gave him bad advice.
[03:25:25.540 --> 03:25:43.386]  But if Trump said to somebody, let's say in the course of something, an official with the federal government, if he said, I knew nothing about this payment from Cohen, and Rudy just said, oh no, he knew about it, he paid him, he in fact even paid, repaid this, now you're having basically, Rudy could be the witness against Trump for perjury.
[03:25:43.846 --> 03:25:46.067]  Yeah, they may know what they're doing.
[03:25:46.107 --> 03:25:47.967]  It's just such a distraction with all the news we've got.
[03:25:48.307 --> 03:25:48.927]  What about this?
[03:25:49.127 --> 03:25:51.228]  Giuliani says Kushner disposable.
[03:25:51.948 --> 03:25:54.348]  The whole country will turn if they go after Ivanka.
[03:25:54.829 --> 03:25:56.529]  So what is he saying there?
[03:25:56.909 --> 03:25:58.069]  Like, go ahead and get him.
[03:25:58.089 --> 03:25:59.670]  We're not going to roll over for Kushner.
[03:26:00.050 --> 03:26:02.350]  And then he's saying, but don't go after Ivanka.
[03:26:02.971 --> 03:26:04.211]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:26:04.231 --> 03:26:04.891]  Let's play that clip.
[03:26:06.061 --> 03:26:10.805]  Now if they do do Ivanka, which I doubt they will, the whole country will turn on him.
[03:26:11.626 --> 03:26:12.727]  They're going after his daughter?
[03:26:13.047 --> 03:26:13.928]  What about his son-in-law?
[03:26:14.568 --> 03:26:15.249]  They talked about him.
[03:26:15.589 --> 03:26:17.991]  I guess Jared is a fine man, you know that.
[03:26:19.312 --> 03:26:22.314]  But men are, you know, disposable.
[03:26:22.915 --> 03:26:24.216]  But a fine woman like Ivanka?
[03:26:24.256 --> 03:26:24.516]  Come on.
[03:26:25.297 --> 03:26:26.278]  Andrew, what does that mean?
[03:26:28.128 --> 03:26:29.509]  What does that even mean?
[03:26:29.589 --> 03:26:29.970]  What is that?
[03:26:30.410 --> 03:26:37.015]  Listen, like I said, you know, Alex... I think they're signaling to Mueller, you go ahead and go after Kushner, we're gonna throw him under the bus.
[03:26:38.353 --> 03:26:39.494]  They're not signaling anything.
[03:26:39.774 --> 03:26:42.056]  If they were going to signal, they would have done this in a better way.
[03:26:42.376 --> 03:26:49.441]  Not on national television, and not because you can hear Sean trying to rehabilitate Rudy during the first question.
[03:26:49.461 --> 03:26:50.922]  He said, uh, are you sure?
[03:26:50.962 --> 03:26:53.604]  You know, my understanding of this is such and such.
[03:26:53.844 --> 03:26:56.826]  Look, this is, this is an example.
[03:26:56.886 --> 03:26:58.087]  This is the legal team.
[03:26:58.107 --> 03:26:59.368]  Yeah, is Giuliani over the hill?
[03:26:59.388 --> 03:27:00.869]  Because he's kind of acting a little crazy.
[03:27:01.846 --> 03:27:06.767]  Well, look, I don't want to do to him what they're doing to Kanye West whenever you do something or whenever you're misspoken.
[03:27:07.407 --> 03:27:10.888]  I don't know if he was feeling a little too comfortable with this.
[03:27:11.288 --> 03:27:12.288]  I have no idea.
[03:27:12.568 --> 03:27:13.828]  All I know is this.
[03:27:14.268 --> 03:27:20.510]  Today, you have to understand and you have to master electronic advocacy, not only courtroom.
[03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:25.290]  Going on TV can actually change the way charges are brought.
[03:27:25.551 --> 03:27:26.731]  It could change the momentum.
[03:27:26.811 --> 03:27:27.651]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:27:28.151 --> 03:27:30.095]  So let's move to this next subject because I'm going to let you take over.
[03:27:30.115 --> 03:27:30.777]  You've got a lot to cover.
[03:27:30.797 --> 03:27:32.320]  This is the doctor.
[03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:45.016]  of the President, who says that he's in great health and all this, and that no, I didn't, you know, get told what to write, this is the truth, I wrote it, he's all testified to that, he said that a year and a half ago.
[03:27:45.576 --> 03:27:51.499]  Now he says no, I dictated it over the phone, and I feel like Trump raped me because they came and got my medical records.
[03:27:51.519 --> 03:27:58.243]  Well, I know under law, I can go get my medical records from the doctor, anything that's digitized, like prescriptions, whatever's online.
[03:27:58.863 --> 03:28:00.664]  But then, that's law.
[03:28:00.784 --> 03:28:05.708]  But if the doctor says I'm on Propecia publicly and I didn't authorize that with the HIPAA release, that's a federal crime.
[03:28:06.008 --> 03:28:08.790]  So it looks like the doctor to me is committing a federal crime.
[03:28:09.251 --> 03:28:10.592]  We're going to come back and play the clip.
[03:28:10.612 --> 03:28:13.774]  I'm going to get your take on this and then get out of here for you to take over.
[03:28:14.254 --> 03:28:16.036]  Because, you know, you're a lawyer, former prosecutor.
[03:28:16.856 --> 03:28:18.297]  Maybe I'm wrong about HIPAA, but I've looked it up.
[03:28:18.878 --> 03:28:21.280]  Suddenly, I know they put pressure on everybody that supports Trump.
[03:28:21.300 --> 03:28:21.800]  They've done it to me.
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:24.042]  So suddenly this guy says he hates Trump.
[03:28:24.802 --> 03:28:28.904]  And when I said he was on Propecia, they came and took the medical files, and I feel raped.
[03:28:29.385 --> 03:28:31.146]  And he's sitting there like he's this poor victim.
[03:28:31.426 --> 03:28:32.486]  Why would you do this?
[03:28:32.506 --> 03:28:43.552]  You also have a duty as a kind of almost a physician-patient duty and privilege, though not... to not reveal and embarrass patients.
[03:28:43.953 --> 03:28:44.433]  I don't get it.
[03:28:44.892 --> 03:28:45.332]  Well, stay there.
[03:28:45.352 --> 03:28:45.893]  You're absolutely right.
[03:28:45.973 --> 03:28:51.056]  Actually, under the Hippocratic Oath and the law, doctors aren't supposed to reveal anything personal.
[03:28:51.076 --> 03:28:53.498]  So, he's out here blabbering the President's personal stuff.
[03:28:53.818 --> 03:28:56.620]  The day after he does it, they show him, they'll give us the medical records, jackass!
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:58.541]  And he goes, I feel raped!
[03:28:59.102 --> 03:29:00.943]  And CNN headline, Doctor Raped!
[03:29:02.475 --> 03:29:11.504]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:29:11.584 --> 03:29:19.813]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:29:19.993 --> 03:29:24.658]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:29:24.858 --> 03:29:31.585]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:29:31.645 --> 03:29:38.732]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:29:38.832 --> 03:29:45.679]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:29:45.839 --> 03:29:50.182]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:29:50.302 --> 03:29:53.584]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:29:53.724 --> 03:29:59.849]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:30:00.029 --> 03:30:01.730]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:02.410 --> 03:30:10.196]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:30:10.936 --> 03:30:15.001]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:30:15.502 --> 03:30:17.845]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:30:18.646 --> 03:30:21.769]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:30:23.274 --> 03:30:35.422]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:30:36.122 --> 03:30:51.172]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:30:52.172 --> 03:30:55.834]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsStore.com what it could do for your family.
[03:30:55.854 --> 03:30:58.135]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:30:58.175 --> 03:31:00.577]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:31:01.077 --> 03:31:04.859]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:31:04.879 --> 03:31:06.620]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:09.862]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:31:10.968 --> 03:31:22.011]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:31:22.451 --> 03:31:31.514]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:31:32.054 --> 03:31:37.621]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:31:37.841 --> 03:31:43.008]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:31:43.288 --> 03:31:45.250]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:31:45.551 --> 03:31:47.573]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:31:48.570 --> 03:31:51.631]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:31:51.851 --> 03:31:53.252]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:31:53.872 --> 03:31:56.433]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:31:57.173 --> 03:31:59.154]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:31:59.714 --> 03:32:01.955]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:32:02.850 --> 03:32:03.571]  I'm so excited.
[03:32:03.591 --> 03:32:13.197]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:32:13.797 --> 03:32:18.981]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:32:19.301 --> 03:32:22.103]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:32:22.323 --> 03:32:31.069]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:41.257]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:32:41.397 --> 03:32:52.287]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:52.787 --> 03:32:54.088]  It is amazing!
[03:32:55.470 --> 03:33:00.454]  Red Pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:33:06.647 --> 03:33:09.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.880 --> 03:33:24.605]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.026 --> 03:33:30.491]  Man, I gotta get Lionel on my show more, because he just really knows what he's talking about.
[03:33:31.653 --> 03:33:32.915]  And I'm not trying to put the president down.
[03:33:32.935 --> 03:33:34.697]  He's done a lot of good stuff.
[03:33:34.717 --> 03:33:35.478]  The globalists hate him.
[03:33:35.498 --> 03:33:36.300]  He's trying to be president.
[03:33:36.780 --> 03:33:38.322]  He's trying to return power back to America.
[03:33:39.604 --> 03:33:40.886]  That's good, but it doesn't mean he's perfect.
[03:33:41.653 --> 03:33:44.095]  And we're not running a cult here of Trump.
[03:33:44.875 --> 03:33:46.837]  But if we were with Hillary, we would already be in a giant war.
[03:33:46.877 --> 03:33:47.897]  She'd said that was her plan.
[03:33:47.917 --> 03:33:50.779]  But the same forces are dragging Trump towards it.
[03:33:50.819 --> 03:33:52.480]  I know Lionel's got more coming up.
[03:33:52.500 --> 03:33:53.321]  He wants to break down.
[03:33:53.401 --> 03:33:54.102]  I can't wait to hear it.
[03:33:54.142 --> 03:33:58.905]  But finishing up here with Lionel before he takes over, you've heard my take on this.
[03:33:59.605 --> 03:34:07.551]  The doctor says last year, we now learn, I remember it was on the news, President Trump's on Propecia to stop hair loss.
[03:34:10.765 --> 03:34:13.446]  That violates HIPAA.
[03:34:13.486 --> 03:34:17.708]  That violates the doctor-patient relationship, just like between a lawyer and a client.
[03:34:18.648 --> 03:34:20.149]  And my dad's a physician.
[03:34:20.729 --> 03:34:22.050]  I mean, I grew up knowing about that.
[03:34:22.090 --> 03:34:23.090]  I see it in the news all the time.
[03:34:23.370 --> 03:34:29.853]  People release tiny medical records of, you know, Brad Pitt's baby, and they get five years in prison, ten years in prison.
[03:34:30.984 --> 03:34:35.047]  That's something we've all been, you know, you know, taught about even with employment where you've got people's insurance.
[03:34:35.288 --> 03:34:40.812]  And sometimes insurance companies call you to ask a question about, hey, a sentence that's there, you don't say anything to the insurance company.
[03:34:40.832 --> 03:34:41.973]  You get them on the phone with the employee.
[03:34:43.094 --> 03:34:44.155]  This is dangerous stuff.
[03:34:44.235 --> 03:34:46.157]  You don't talk about people's private medical records.
[03:34:46.597 --> 03:34:47.558]  So the doctor does this.
[03:34:49.329 --> 03:34:52.031]  And then a year later, he goes, I feel raped.
[03:34:52.091 --> 03:34:55.154]  They came the day after I talked about his propitia.
[03:34:55.935 --> 03:34:57.556]  And we'll play the clip right here.
[03:34:58.357 --> 03:34:59.998]  And I feel raped.
[03:35:00.038 --> 03:35:00.999]  I guess the whole Me Too thing.
[03:35:01.039 --> 03:35:06.204]  So I guess now, here he is defaming the president saying, I feel raped by men coming and taking this.
[03:35:07.625 --> 03:35:09.366]  He called it a raid.
[03:35:09.446 --> 03:35:14.050]  Alex, right off the bat, Alex, would you pick this guy as your physician?
[03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.511]  Seriously.
[03:35:14.531 --> 03:35:15.211]  I mean, just look at him.
[03:35:15.251 --> 03:35:15.952]  Let me just say something.
[03:35:16.625 --> 03:35:20.848]  We live in New York City where we have great physicians, as you can imagine.
[03:35:21.228 --> 03:35:22.869]  What is he, with the Oak Ridge Boys?
[03:35:22.889 --> 03:35:23.189]  Who is it?
[03:35:23.589 --> 03:35:26.811]  Billy Lee Golden or whatever it is?
[03:35:26.831 --> 03:35:29.453]  What I'm asking the question is, is... No, I wouldn't.
[03:35:29.473 --> 03:35:31.574]  This guy acts like he's a grateful dead deadhead.
[03:35:31.894 --> 03:35:33.475]  Like he took 5,000 hits of acid.
[03:35:33.495 --> 03:35:34.276]  I'm not saying he did.
[03:35:34.616 --> 03:35:35.756]  He acts like his brain's wiped.
[03:35:35.776 --> 03:35:39.959]  So I think this is a strike against Trump that he's got Bozo the Clown as his physician.
[03:35:41.381 --> 03:35:42.721]  Well, okay, that's number one.
[03:35:42.961 --> 03:35:52.783]  Number two, you could have had so many physicians out there who would have had, by the way, so many degrees and plaques on the wall, you couldn't see any color to the wall.
[03:35:52.823 --> 03:35:57.464]  This is sparse at best, because I go for visuals and optics, I'm sorry.
[03:35:57.805 --> 03:36:08.707]  But the next thing is, is that while there may not be in law, and by the way, keep this in mind, depending upon your jurisdiction, there is not necessarily the physician-patient privilege
[03:36:10.747 --> 03:36:22.192]  In terms of courtroom privileges like husband and wife, there is still within the regular laws and the regulatory administrative rules of it, some rules as well.
[03:36:22.432 --> 03:36:24.633]  Let me tell you something about HIPAA, how bad HIPAA is.
[03:36:25.013 --> 03:36:28.514]  HIPAA is the most draconian, though very, very good.
[03:36:28.775 --> 03:36:34.957]  Do you know, Alex, there was a case one time where there was a police officer who walked into an emergency room.
[03:36:35.377 --> 03:36:36.558]  Actually doing his job.
[03:36:36.598 --> 03:36:37.638]  It was an emergency.
[03:36:37.758 --> 03:36:41.520]  Came in, and he had his body camera thing on.
[03:36:42.020 --> 03:36:49.384]  They were freaked out that maybe this showed either what you could see in the terminals, or people who were there.
[03:36:49.824 --> 03:36:50.705]  HIPAA's huge!
[03:36:50.965 --> 03:36:53.886]  Now, did Trump authorize him to do this?
[03:36:54.206 --> 03:36:58.608]  If Trump didn't say, hey listen, go ahead, Moondog.
[03:36:58.728 --> 03:36:59.429]  Oh my god.
[03:36:59.669 --> 03:37:03.531]  Well we know he didn't, because Trump got mad the next day and had his medical records pulled.
[03:37:04.355 --> 03:37:11.257]  So you're seeing the loosest, the most amateurish... I mean, you're in the fight of your life.
[03:37:11.497 --> 03:37:13.497]  You're at the highest echelon.
[03:37:13.837 --> 03:37:16.378]  Say what you want about Obama or Hillary.
[03:37:16.698 --> 03:37:18.398]  I don't think they would have done that.
[03:37:18.798 --> 03:37:20.039]  This is very, very loose.
[03:37:20.279 --> 03:37:23.620]  But also, here's the thing which always bothers me.
[03:37:23.820 --> 03:37:24.440]  You know, Trump would...
[03:37:25.260 --> 03:37:28.982]  Alex, whenever Trump does something, people say, ah, that's his genius.
[03:37:29.262 --> 03:37:30.783]  That's that 4D chess.
[03:37:30.823 --> 03:37:31.703]  I'm thinking, wait a minute.
[03:37:31.943 --> 03:37:32.844]  What are you talking about?
[03:37:33.064 --> 03:37:34.724]  I'm going to tell you what I would tell him.
[03:37:35.085 --> 03:37:36.525]  He's got to tighten the ranks here.
[03:37:36.825 --> 03:37:40.147]  And also, there's this thing I want to tell him.
[03:37:42.203 --> 03:37:43.664]  Alex, I've known this.
[03:37:43.944 --> 03:37:46.444]  He has been a New York fixture for years.
[03:37:46.524 --> 03:37:47.745]  He has been in the news.
[03:37:48.085 --> 03:37:52.026]  He used to pick up the phone sometimes and if he wanted to plan something, hell, he'd call it himself.
[03:37:52.326 --> 03:37:53.826]  He was the darling.
[03:37:54.306 --> 03:37:54.947]  Blessed.
[03:37:55.487 --> 03:37:57.547]  Never, ever, there was no repercussions.
[03:37:57.827 --> 03:37:59.348]  As long as his name was in the paper.
[03:37:59.568 --> 03:38:01.028]  So this is the mindset.
[03:38:01.468 --> 03:38:02.929]  You're the president now.
[03:38:03.389 --> 03:38:04.909]  And I can't say this enough.
[03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.809]  Read this 18 U.S.C. 1001.
[03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:08.931]  You don't have to be under oath.
[03:38:09.111 --> 03:38:19.137]  If you in any way mislead anybody in the government, if he talked to somebody, if there was somebody, an agent, asking him questions, who knows?
[03:38:19.678 --> 03:38:24.761]  And you have somebody on TV going back to Giuliani saying, oh no, that's a bunch of BS.
[03:38:24.821 --> 03:38:25.141]  No!
[03:38:25.522 --> 03:38:29.364]  That story that everybody's been telling- They're going to use that to say he's a liar.
[03:38:29.384 --> 03:38:30.305]  Let's talk about the doctor, though.
[03:38:30.325 --> 03:38:30.845]  Let's show this.
[03:38:30.885 --> 03:38:32.106]  This just shows- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:38:32.126 --> 03:38:32.526]  No, you're right.
[03:38:32.586 --> 03:38:36.489]  How they're stretching everything, how they're turning everything into something.
[03:38:37.805 --> 03:38:42.007]  The doctor, it looks like, released his medical records without authorization, at least the propitia part.
[03:38:42.067 --> 03:38:44.948]  So the next day, Trump sends people to get his records, which you're allowed to do under law.
[03:38:45.208 --> 03:38:46.108]  Your records belong to you.
[03:38:46.589 --> 03:38:50.050]  And then the media turns this into, he says he feels raped.
[03:38:50.170 --> 03:38:50.570]  Here it is.
[03:38:51.611 --> 03:38:52.351]  I feel raped.
[03:38:55.692 --> 03:38:58.013]  That's how I feel.
[03:38:58.033 --> 03:38:59.094]  Raped, frightened.
[03:38:59.114 --> 03:39:00.174]  Hey, we started a little bit late.
[03:39:00.214 --> 03:39:00.894]  Back it up, back it up.
[03:39:00.934 --> 03:39:04.756]  I want people to hear this very... Can we slow this down five times?
[03:39:05.356 --> 03:39:06.156]  Just the part about raped.
[03:39:06.617 --> 03:39:07.217]  Can we slow it down?
[03:39:08.730 --> 03:39:10.352]  I feel raped.
[03:39:11.252 --> 03:39:12.373]  I feel raped.
[03:39:17.357 --> 03:39:20.119]  That's how I feel.
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:21.340]  Raped.
[03:39:22.221 --> 03:39:22.922]  Frightened.
[03:39:23.742 --> 03:39:30.288]  And, um... Sad.
[03:39:34.431 --> 03:39:36.454]  You're making a big deal about it.
[03:39:36.775 --> 03:39:37.616]  Grow this.
[03:39:38.317 --> 03:39:42.744]  To grow his hair, which seems to be so important.
[03:39:56.474 --> 03:39:56.954]  That's enough.
[03:39:56.974 --> 03:39:58.876]  He's saying what's the matter?
[03:39:59.456 --> 03:40:00.717]  I released that he's on this drug.
[03:40:01.158 --> 03:40:04.480]  Any of it's a federal violation and I agree it's our private information.
[03:40:04.701 --> 03:40:05.741]  He says what's the big deal?
[03:40:06.636 --> 03:40:07.817]  Here, let's finish it up in real time.
[03:40:08.077 --> 03:40:09.958]  They came and they took the records.
[03:40:10.138 --> 03:40:10.899]  I feel raped.
[03:40:11.219 --> 03:40:11.779]  Boo-hoo.
[03:40:11.899 --> 03:40:12.940]  I feel sad.
[03:40:12.960 --> 03:40:15.121]  Do you know what the Propecia connection is?
[03:40:15.461 --> 03:40:16.162]  What are the side effects?
[03:40:16.182 --> 03:40:17.403]  Erectile dysfunction.
[03:40:18.063 --> 03:40:18.263]  Right.
[03:40:18.403 --> 03:40:23.446]  So what they're doing is, so what you've done is you've just given Stephen Colbert's 1,000 writers
[03:40:25.227 --> 03:40:27.209]  And you've given them now more fodder.
[03:40:27.609 --> 03:40:31.612]  You volunteered something that you didn't have to mention.
[03:40:31.712 --> 03:40:32.712]  What are you, Kathy Griffin?
[03:40:32.952 --> 03:40:33.853]  She broke me?
[03:40:33.873 --> 03:40:35.394]  You're going to break into that one next?
[03:40:35.754 --> 03:40:41.078]  So here was a situation with all the, you know, for whatever you do, do no harm.
[03:40:41.098 --> 03:40:41.818]  It's Hippocratic Oath.
[03:40:42.059 --> 03:40:44.560]  How about say nothing?
[03:40:44.860 --> 03:40:46.341]  Nobody was putting a gun to his head.
[03:40:46.361 --> 03:40:47.162]  No, but I totally agree.
[03:40:47.302 --> 03:40:54.567]  All I'm saying is this is a nothing story, but it shows how they take a doctor leaking his medical information, that's a crime, on the face of it,
[03:40:54.927 --> 03:40:57.289]  With now, Trump's a rapist and can't get a heart on.
[03:40:57.369 --> 03:41:00.152]  It just shows how they take the littlest thing and then twist it.
[03:41:00.372 --> 03:41:06.577]  Here, let's play what he actually said in real time and then what you mentioned from them making fun of the erectile dysfunction, which doesn't exist, they're just saying it.
[03:41:06.597 --> 03:41:06.917]  Here it is.
[03:41:07.498 --> 03:41:08.259]  I feel raped.
[03:41:11.601 --> 03:41:13.423]  That's how I feel.
[03:41:13.923 --> 03:41:14.244]  Raped.
[03:41:14.884 --> 03:41:15.325]  Frightened.
[03:41:15.585 --> 03:41:16.666]  I feel raped by this guy.
[03:41:18.227 --> 03:41:19.088]  And sad.
[03:41:19.929 --> 03:41:20.249]  Sad.
[03:41:21.673 --> 03:41:28.799]  I couldn't believe anybody was making a big deal about a drug that's to grow his hair, which seemed to be so important.
[03:41:29.900 --> 03:41:34.784]  And it certainly is not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Ropecia to grow their hair.
[03:41:34.804 --> 03:41:35.144]  Really?
[03:41:35.164 --> 03:41:36.285]  What's the matter with that?
[03:41:36.385 --> 03:41:43.150]  I was completely surprised the morning or two after the story about his hair ran.
[03:41:43.871 --> 03:41:46.033]  She said, so you want it to be the White House doctor?
[03:41:46.333 --> 03:41:46.813]  Forget it.
[03:41:47.114 --> 03:41:47.474]  You're out.
[03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:50.481]  What exactly were they looking for?
[03:41:51.221 --> 03:41:55.703]  Well, his medical records, his pictures, anything they could find must have been here.
[03:41:56.123 --> 03:41:58.004]  This guy just leaked the medical stuff.
[03:41:58.024 --> 03:42:03.727]  Violates federal law, admits, oh it's the big deal I did it, and now he's pissed that the victim wants his medical records.
[03:42:05.287 --> 03:42:12.931]  And what would have possibly motivated this man, after all he's said and done so far, doesn't he have a friend that says,
[03:42:13.618 --> 03:42:15.160]  Don't say anything!
[03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:23.047]  Has he ever said, ever, I got a better one for your team, find him ever saying, I can't answer that.
[03:42:24.088 --> 03:42:25.390]  I can't answer that question.
[03:42:25.450 --> 03:42:26.711]  This is privileged communication.
[03:42:26.731 --> 03:42:30.615]  You're going to talk about it all when you take over on the other side, but first here they are talking about it.
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:36.724]  He sent a White House employee to go through, to rob someone, as far as we can tell.
[03:42:36.804 --> 03:42:38.565]  I mean, that's what this is being claimed.
[03:42:38.605 --> 03:42:39.346]  Made me think.
[03:42:40.006 --> 03:42:40.266]  Yes.
[03:42:40.326 --> 03:42:44.069]  Made me, yeah, made me think about those tax returns.
[03:42:44.589 --> 03:42:46.170]  We can't see the tax returns.
[03:42:46.711 --> 03:42:49.213]  He doesn't want people to see stuff that, his stuff.
[03:42:49.713 --> 03:42:52.115]  He doesn't want them to see the- Yeah, like his medical records, you dumb witch!
[03:42:52.135 --> 03:42:53.776]  He doesn't want them to see the tax returns.
[03:42:54.196 --> 03:42:55.617]  What's in those medical records?
[03:42:56.017 --> 03:42:56.578]  And why?
[03:42:56.938 --> 03:42:58.099]  Yeah, give us your medical records!
[03:42:59.107 --> 03:43:01.208]  But, oh, don't question Hillary, though, when she's falling down!
[03:43:02.228 --> 03:43:07.211]  There's only one week left to get 50% off on Super Male Vitality.

[03:44:08.422 --> 03:44:09.543]  We're on more satellites.
[03:44:10.644 --> 03:44:12.025]  We're reaching so many new people.
[03:44:12.065 --> 03:44:15.488]  They are blocking us more and more on the web, but thank God you're getting the information out.
[03:44:15.788 --> 03:44:20.473]  We're having congressional hearings about conservatives, populists, nationalists, Christians being
[03:44:21.616 --> 03:44:22.036]  Censored?
[03:44:22.717 --> 03:44:25.058]  Christian churches being persecuted by the IRS?
[03:44:25.458 --> 03:44:27.079]  I mean, this is real tyranny we're facing.
[03:44:27.179 --> 03:44:33.303]  You, the audience, are the engine, the brains, the guts, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the soul of this operation.
[03:44:33.363 --> 03:44:44.650]  And if you go to Infowarstore.com and look at the water filtration, the air filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, all of it, hundreds of t-shirts, dozens of ball caps,
[03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:53.475]  When you buy those products, you support the information war, but plus, you're wearing an InfoWars shirt, you wear it in a deep blue state area, you might get hit in the head with a tire iron or something, but you wear it everywhere else.
[03:44:53.495 --> 03:44:56.116]  You get your lunch bought for you, you might meet your wife, your husband, whatever.
[03:44:56.196 --> 03:44:59.098]  This is how we just do these little things that move mountains.
[03:44:59.118 --> 03:45:03.060]  Well, you do it by wearing t-shirts, by wearing ball caps, you do it by having a bumper sticker.
[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:06.161]  All the orders that come in to InfoWars have five bumper stickers.
[03:45:06.242 --> 03:45:07.022]  I'm doubling it to
[03:45:07.162 --> 03:45:07.902]  We're good to
[03:45:31.191 --> 03:45:31.512]  It is.
[03:45:32.132 --> 03:45:32.332]  50% off.
[03:45:32.392 --> 03:45:37.016]  Get the two together and get free shipping on the Real Red Pill and Super Melon Vitality.
[03:45:37.056 --> 03:45:38.657]  They both have thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:45:38.677 --> 03:45:41.780]  The combo doesn't have any reviews yet because we just started this special on Monday.
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:43.001]  It's gonna have to end in a week.
[03:45:43.021 --> 03:45:47.624]  The 25% off on the X2 has to end on Monday because we're very close to selling out.
[03:45:47.644 --> 03:45:49.265]  It'll be a month or so till we get more in.
[03:45:49.345 --> 03:45:51.527]  So I'm just gonna let it go to full price until it sells out.
[03:45:51.567 --> 03:45:52.668]  So that sale is about to end.
[03:45:52.708 --> 03:45:55.629]  We also have a special on the super high quality My Patriot Supply.
[03:45:55.789 --> 03:46:00.512]  Three months supply with a free Alexa Pure 200 plus dollar value free water filter.
[03:46:00.552 --> 03:46:02.613]  And yes, they had a C-SPAN thing with David Hogg a month ago.
[03:46:02.633 --> 03:46:05.114]  He goes, and Jones says the water's got toxins in it.
[03:46:05.174 --> 03:46:07.755]  And then the same video, then he has an ad for water filters.
[03:46:07.875 --> 03:46:08.435]  Interesting.
[03:46:08.495 --> 03:46:10.236]  They go, ooh, yeah, scam.
[03:46:10.496 --> 03:46:10.997]  Uh, no.
[03:46:11.097 --> 03:46:12.538]  The water table's full of poison.
[03:46:12.678 --> 03:46:13.498]  Everybody knows that.
[03:46:13.578 --> 03:46:14.119]  It's admitted.
[03:46:14.159 --> 03:46:16.000]  You need to filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46:16.020 --> 03:46:17.301]  We have the best gravity-filled systems.
[03:46:17.541 --> 03:46:19.363]  So, yes, I do a report on how the water's bad.
[03:46:19.443 --> 03:46:22.745]  And then I sell a water filter I use when I'm on the road or in my own home.
[03:46:22.966 --> 03:46:23.966]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:46:24.026 --> 03:46:26.288]  Like if I was gonna open a franchise of a restaurant.
[03:46:26.308 --> 03:46:32.012]  If I was a franchisee, I would find a restaurant that I love, that was successful, and had really good food, that I would want to franchise.
[03:46:32.212 --> 03:46:34.094]  I'd say, can I franchise your great restaurant?
[03:46:34.174 --> 03:46:37.956]  A lot of people have gone in famously to good restaurants, and they've said, I want to franchise this.
[03:46:38.337 --> 03:46:38.977]  Exactly!
[03:46:39.217 --> 03:46:42.259]  I sell what I use, and I like, and I believe in.
[03:46:42.700 --> 03:46:44.861]  But it shows Hogg, and the media thinks it's like a scam.
[03:46:45.382 --> 03:46:49.665]  He had a water filter ad after he talked about atrazine in the water causing sterility.
[03:46:50.958 --> 03:46:52.299]  Oh my god, it's hidden!
[03:46:52.820 --> 03:46:53.721]  Jones said this on air.
[03:46:53.781 --> 03:46:54.381]  We caught it.
[03:46:54.441 --> 03:46:54.942]  Here it is.
[03:46:55.122 --> 03:46:56.343]  It was a big secret.
[03:46:56.663 --> 03:46:57.604]  Millions were watching it.
[03:46:58.084 --> 03:46:59.686]  So, infowarrestore.com.
[03:47:06.071 --> 03:47:08.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.231 --> 03:47:29.072]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:29.572 --> 03:47:33.513]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:40.614 --> 03:47:41.634]  Alrighty, Lionel, with you.
[03:47:43.074 --> 03:47:44.135]  Riders in the storm.
[03:47:44.815 --> 03:47:46.795]  That's what we are, riders on this storm.
[03:47:46.815 --> 03:47:50.976]  I want to finish a couple of things that we said before, you know, with Alex.
[03:47:53.422 --> 03:47:57.364]  It's so wonderful knowing that somebody can think of about 20 different things to say.
[03:47:57.384 --> 03:48:00.865]  And I'm not the only one, because sometimes people say, what are you doing?
[03:48:00.905 --> 03:48:03.386]  Would you would you stick to one subject?
[03:48:03.886 --> 03:48:04.586]  Would you quit?
[03:48:04.826 --> 03:48:05.567]  Would you quit?
[03:48:05.667 --> 03:48:06.387]  Stick to one.
[03:48:06.407 --> 03:48:07.928]  Would you quit going off?
[03:48:07.988 --> 03:48:09.548]  And it's like, no, I'm not going off.
[03:48:09.568 --> 03:48:10.549]  There's a lot to be said.
[03:48:10.569 --> 03:48:14.530]  I mentioned this one particular statue, and I can't say this enough.
[03:48:14.970 --> 03:48:21.413]  And I'm going to go back to the Rudy thing, because when I saw this, I was thunderstruck and amazed.
[03:48:23.314 --> 03:48:24.014]  18 U.S.C.
[03:48:24.034 --> 03:48:24.014]  1001.
[03:48:24.134 --> 03:48:27.016]  Statements or entries generally.
[03:48:27.096 --> 03:48:27.536]  Listen to this.
[03:48:29.077 --> 03:48:40.383]  Whoever in any matter, in any matter, within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the government, knowingly and willfully,
[03:48:41.345 --> 03:48:55.215]  falsifies, conceals, or covers up by trick, scheme, or device, makes any material false, fictitious, or statement, make a long story short, shall be fined by not more than five years in the federal prison.
[03:48:55.335 --> 03:49:01.059]  Meaning, if you mislead, doesn't matter necessarily that you're under oath.
[03:49:01.579 --> 03:49:04.802]  Now, I want to go back to this doctor thing, just for one second.
[03:49:06.563 --> 03:49:11.026]  First, on so many levels, how is it that this man would say,
[03:49:11.753 --> 03:49:23.287]  I'm going to tell all of my patients, all of the people that go to me, that your information is not protected.
[03:49:24.048 --> 03:49:27.553]  If indeed I'm not going to protect the President,
[03:49:28.582 --> 03:49:36.908]  If I'm not going to hold his personal information, sacrosanct, privileged, as I should, why would I do yours?
[03:49:37.509 --> 03:49:51.359]  If I'm going to give in and reveal things and act this befuddled with a patient, a patient of a lifetime, for the rest of my life I'll be able to say, you know, I'm the President's personal physician.
[03:49:51.980 --> 03:49:55.622]  You know what that does in terms of cachet, in terms of clout?
[03:49:56.143 --> 03:50:04.068]  To say that you're the President's personal physician, and nothing, most people, would let nothing get in the way of that.
[03:50:05.088 --> 03:50:15.615]  So instead of doing everything to maintain that, for nothing more than just personal, commercial reasons, this man says, no, no, no, no, I'm going to violate this.
[03:50:15.935 --> 03:50:18.817]  HIPAA laws are so monumentally important.
[03:50:19.157 --> 03:50:20.598]  I think we've stated this.
[03:50:23.410 --> 03:50:24.710]  Let me just tell you this much.
[03:50:25.631 --> 03:50:31.952]  Remember in the old days, maybe you recall the days when you go to an old-fashioned grocery store.
[03:50:31.972 --> 03:50:34.933]  There'd be a pyramid of oranges, like in the produce section.
[03:50:35.753 --> 03:50:43.995]  And if you walked up to that pyramid of all these beautifully stacked oranges, if you picked that one in the middle, sometimes everything's fine.
[03:50:44.916 --> 03:50:48.296]  But the wrong one, it all comes tumbling down.
[03:50:49.657 --> 03:50:50.557]  I promise you,
[03:50:51.536 --> 03:51:03.541]  That all the president has to do, and how this team grabs what I say so fast and provides a gif or a gif or whatever, it amazes me.
[03:51:03.561 --> 03:51:18.467]  But if he were to do the following, if you're somewhere, and you will be there one day, and you look at your phone and people will be calling you and you realize that Hillary Clinton has been taken into custody.
[03:51:19.105 --> 03:51:21.066]  Or that Hillary Clinton will be charged.
[03:51:21.266 --> 03:51:27.147]  Or that a grand jury in West Virginia, or wherever, has indicted Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:51:27.308 --> 03:51:29.388]  The oven mitt fashionista.
[03:51:29.708 --> 03:51:30.008]  Okay?
[03:51:31.949 --> 03:51:34.110]  You, you will have to sit down.
[03:51:34.130 --> 03:51:36.850]  I will have to have resuscitation.
[03:51:37.711 --> 03:51:41.492]  The entire mainstream media will be paralyzed.
[03:51:42.072 --> 03:51:45.113]  Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow, go down the list.
[03:51:45.953 --> 03:51:48.534]  They won't know what to do.
[03:51:49.904 --> 03:51:54.026]  They will completely be, there will be such a frisson of activity.
[03:51:54.466 --> 03:51:56.267]  They would be apoplectic.
[03:51:57.648 --> 03:52:06.692]  And all of this, this focus that was on the president will be on the beloved, on this patron saint of whatever.
[03:52:07.853 --> 03:52:26.127]  Because every single thing, and I want you to listen very carefully, every single thing that we're doing today, every bit about the Russian investigation, or the Russian collusion, or the Trump this, or that, and the dossier, and everything, Comey, Mueller, all of it has to do with Hillary Clinton trying to justify losing a rigged election.
[03:52:27.328 --> 03:52:32.712]  Every single thing, everything that we're doing stems from that.
[03:52:33.448 --> 03:52:39.589]  She is still, not only not disappointed in herself, but disappointed with you, and I guess the country.
[03:52:39.909 --> 03:52:53.572]  Now, the next thing that will happen once she's charged, and if I could pick something, I am telling you what would be the most important and most critical, would be something involving the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, or the Clinton Health Access Initiative.
[03:52:53.632 --> 03:52:59.393]  And the reason for that is because the laws, the laws regarding
[03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:02.531]  These graphics are killing me.
[03:53:02.832 --> 03:53:09.618]  The laws regarding charitable institutions and the like are so brutal.
[03:53:10.238 --> 03:53:12.120]  Do you know that this was started in, what, 97?
[03:53:12.360 --> 03:53:18.245]  They haven't had maybe an audit, the Clinton Foundation, maybe ever in 20 years?
[03:53:18.706 --> 03:53:27.874]  Now, I know it doesn't sound exciting because there's all types of, you know, discussions of a child, you know, trafficking and pedophilia and servers being smashed.
[03:53:28.388 --> 03:53:29.649]  Believe me when I tell you this.
[03:53:29.989 --> 03:53:43.400]  Now the next step is, after she's charged with this, and they go after the various people, they go to people like the Soroses and the Bill Gates types and the Rothschilds, and they say, listen, let me ask you a question.
[03:53:44.301 --> 03:53:46.202]  You know, you contributed to her, didn't you?
[03:53:46.402 --> 03:53:46.702]  Yes.
[03:53:47.203 --> 03:53:48.664]  You're involved in this, yes.
[03:53:48.964 --> 03:53:50.966]  Not only that, pension funds, countries,
[03:53:51.687 --> 03:53:54.229]  It is estimated by some to be about $100 billion.
[03:53:54.810 --> 03:54:05.419]  The entire, this criminal conspiracy, if you will, that makes the Gambino crime family look like the Junior League in comparison.
[03:54:06.660 --> 03:54:13.867]  Now if you went and said, I want you to do me a favor and we will let you off the hook, whoever you big shots are, disabuse yourself of her,
[03:54:15.217 --> 03:54:16.518]  Disengage from her.
[03:54:16.898 --> 03:54:18.220]  Throw her under the bus.
[03:54:18.580 --> 03:54:19.661]  We will leave you alone.
[03:54:20.061 --> 03:54:25.645]  Because everything that you're going to be facing right now has to do with your affiliation with and to her.
[03:54:26.446 --> 03:54:31.030]  If they say it's a deal, that's the end of it all.
[03:54:31.330 --> 03:54:32.551]  Now, at the same time,
[03:54:33.502 --> 03:54:53.008]  People like Colbert and Jimmy Fallon, not Jimmy Fallon, but Kimmel and others, and you name it, will be seeking grief counselors, they'll have their own little puppies, they'll have to go into quiet rooms, because this woman who represents everything to them, for reasons I'll never understand, is finally being charged.
[03:54:53.328 --> 03:54:56.849]  And you will see rats jumping off of this sinking ship.
[03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:58.489]  That is critical.
[03:54:59.129 --> 03:55:00.670]  Believe me when I tell you this.
[03:55:01.394 --> 03:55:20.269]  It will throw them for a loop, because every single day that this president has to play defensive, every single day that he has to parry and thrust and try to ward off some blow, he takes away from the duty that he owes us, pursuant to his Article 2 responsibilities.
[03:55:21.450 --> 03:55:23.952]  Hillary Clinton is critical.
[03:55:24.693 --> 03:55:25.093]  That's it.
[03:55:25.954 --> 03:55:27.455]  And what he does is he simply does this.
[03:55:27.535 --> 03:55:28.856]  He brings everybody into his office,
[03:55:29.938 --> 03:55:32.480]  And he says, now I want you to listen to me and listen good.
[03:55:33.361 --> 03:55:34.381]  I'm going to tell you this.
[03:55:34.882 --> 03:55:36.143]  And you might think this is untoward.
[03:55:36.163 --> 03:55:37.704]  You might think, oh, I really can't do this.
[03:55:37.944 --> 03:55:38.865]  But believe me, I can.
[03:55:39.205 --> 03:55:40.106]  I know a little bit about this.
[03:55:41.267 --> 03:55:46.631]  I want you to tell me when the first indictment is available.
[03:55:47.011 --> 03:55:57.019]  And if whoever says, well, we're not going to do that, or we've exhausted that investigation, or it's better if we don't, you're fired.
[03:55:57.540 --> 03:55:58.601]  Let me make that clear.
[03:55:59.081 --> 03:56:08.908]  Whoever says we can't do that, shouldn't do that, it wouldn't be in the best interest of justice, anything roughly resembling what I just told you is gone.
[03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:10.570]  Now, let's start with you.
[03:56:11.370 --> 03:56:13.131]  When are you going to bring me something?
[03:56:13.151 --> 03:56:14.472]  What do you have for me?
[03:56:15.333 --> 03:56:16.154]  I am the president.
[03:56:16.434 --> 03:56:17.555]  I'm in charge of the executive.
[03:56:17.615 --> 03:56:18.535]  You work for me.
[03:56:18.696 --> 03:56:19.776]  There's nothing new to this.
[03:56:20.437 --> 03:56:22.278]  Believe me when I tell you this.
[03:56:22.839 --> 03:56:23.479]  Believe me.
[03:56:23.919 --> 03:56:25.821]  They won't know what to do.
[03:56:26.602 --> 03:56:36.444]  And Hillary Clinton will come out and try to song and dance, and she will look at you, and look at these people, and she will say, you don't understand who I am.
[03:56:37.444 --> 03:56:44.206]  You don't understand who I am, to which the Department of Justice will respond, you don't understand who he is.
[03:56:45.306 --> 03:56:46.326]  We've tried everything.
[03:56:46.927 --> 03:56:52.888]  You, and remember, Clinton Foundation, bring in, you know, Bubba Too as well,
[03:56:53.769 --> 03:56:56.290]  And Chelsea better be very careful because she's signing on to things.
[03:56:56.831 --> 03:56:58.632]  That is the answer to all of this.
[03:56:58.952 --> 03:57:02.614]  Everything else, removing Comey and that, that's nice.
[03:57:03.174 --> 03:57:04.755]  She is the linchpin.
[03:57:05.255 --> 03:57:06.355]  She is the connector.
[03:57:06.676 --> 03:57:18.081]  I'm telling you, the gravamen, the basis, the ground zero of justice is that woman.
[03:57:18.381 --> 03:57:19.502]  I'm telling you.
[03:57:20.436 --> 03:57:22.517]  I want to thank you so, so much for this.
[03:57:22.797 --> 03:57:24.758]  Alex, you are just without peer.
[03:57:25.378 --> 03:57:32.261]  And remember, as I said before, just because we hold the president to his duties doesn't mean we've abandoned him.
[03:57:32.702 --> 03:57:33.422]  Thank you so much.
