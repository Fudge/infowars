[00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:17.615]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:42.709]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, a tale of two cities.
[00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.370]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.951]  It's Friday, the 27th day of April 2018.
[00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:56.334]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours in the War Room with Roger Stone and the great Owen Schroyer will be coming up.
[00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:04.158]  Peace is breaking out on the North Korean peninsula.
[00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.879]  And I can tell you exactly why peace is breaking out.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.981]  And I will break it down in this first hour.
[00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:38.267]  But simply put, there's a new sheriff in town and the globalists with China have specifically wanted a strategy of tension in the South China Sea as a pretext to move globalist forces into the area and as a pretext for China to have a diversion anytime they want it.
[00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:47.102]  And Trump does not want to continue to have the strategy of patience or the strategy of tension and these Machiavellian things.
[00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:48.563]  He wants stability and trade.
[00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:55.448]  And so massive pressure has been brought to bear right to the edge of a major trade war with China.
[00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:03.494]  Huge sanctions on North Korea that actually squeezed Kim Jong-un, the sickening creature.
[00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.597]  And he is also wanting to be on the world stage.
[00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:09.618]  So he wants to meet with Trump.
[00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:18.447]  And the plans and discussions have been going on for decades in the 60-plus year conflict that has never been ended.
[00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:29.533]  The war is still ongoing to have a armistice turn into a peace deal and then turn into a 10-year plan to begin partial reunification between the North and South.
[00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:33.356]  Now back on March 8th, I told you that.
[00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:37.098]  I was on semi-vacation in Colorado with the family.
[00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.300]  I called in when Owen Schroer was hosting.
[00:02:41.653 --> 00:03:02.751]  And I said that I have sources in the State Department and Pentagon that said that this is a big victory, that so far they've already agreed to denuclearization, a peace deal, and that all of that had happened the day before in North Korea's capital with the head of South Korea's intelligence and military.
[00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.435]  Now, weeks later, word for word, it came out what I said.
[00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:09.737]  And it's not about tooting our horn, it's just
[00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:22.657]  The fact that we do have great sources and we're reporting on something very, very positive that at least so far as getting to the meeting table, Kim Jong-un has agreed to this stuff.
[00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:27.279]  Now, he might try to weasel out of it, but can you imagine?
[00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:36.603]  It's kind of like keeping the West and Coca-Cola and blue jeans and rock and roll, Scorpions out of Rolling Stones out of Russia.
[00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:47.316]  Well imagine North Korea trying to keep millions and millions of people in the dark about what planet they even live on, and only a few cities even have partial electricity.
[00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:53.301]  Why would that establishment really, really want that?
[00:03:55.583 --> 00:04:02.549]  Why would they actually want to live like something out of the dystopic science fiction movie?
[00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.472]  Where they've got weapons and nukes and everything, but
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.381]  Cannibalism is openly practiced.
[00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:13.262]  So it's communism rock bottom.
[00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:21.526]  And if you get more of the fascist model like China has, where Communist Party's still in charge, but...
[00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.347]  They get to become billionaires.
[00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:28.708]  Well, North Korea is going to go for that move.
[00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:33.510]  Still use their people as slaves, but it's kind of like Saudi Arabia's reforms.
[00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.652]  Well, women can drive cars and some can go to college and you don't have to have your eyes completely covered.
[00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:39.813]  You can have a slit now.
[00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.094]  And it'll be the same North Korea.
[00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:45.575]  But the point is, that's still big reforms compared to where they're at.
[00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:49.737]  And Trump and new policies has moved that there, showing
[00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:59.712]  That Trump has been right, and that Trump is really smart, and that Trump is a genius, and he's upsetting the entire geopolitical order, and it's a beautiful thing to see.
[00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:12.623]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:20.850]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.792]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:32.676]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:39.839]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.803]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:51.325]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:54.687]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:05:54.827 --> 00:06:00.969]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.810]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.502]  Yeah.
[00:06:54.626 --> 00:07:01.173]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.895]  Move, bitch!
[00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:06.219]  Get out of the way!
[00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:18.268]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:21.590]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.571]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.232]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.393]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:34.175]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.196]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:37.917]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:44.976]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday Global Transmission.
[00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:48.838]  Smiles from Kim Jong-un.
[00:07:48.898 --> 00:07:51.280]  That's the Drudge Report headline.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.201]  No more war.
[00:07:54.221 --> 00:08:06.808]  And they are tentatively the Associated Press reports moving towards the end of the Korean War that never stopped but simply got paused during the armistice of July
[00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:13.769]  27th, 1953.
[00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:17.591]  And so the leaders of North and South Korea hugging.
[00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:23.175]  We have dramatic film footage if you're watching us on television of this.
[00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:35.303]  This has never happened since the Communist Chinese in 1950 sent in four million troops to fight alongside the North Koreans.
[00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:38.125]  Then they sent five million more in
[00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:48.773]  In 1953, and overran our forces that had been beating them, MacArthur wanted to hit them with nuclear weapons, atomic bombs at the time, and he was relieved of command.
[00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:53.217]  We would have a whole different world.
[00:08:53.978 --> 00:08:59.183]  MacArthur believed it was wrong to put the Communists into China.
[00:09:00.264 --> 00:09:03.928]  It was wrong to have put Chiang Kai-shek on the island of Taiwan.
[00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:10.012]  And he wrote about it, spoke in Congress about it, in his farewell address.
[00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:13.413]  Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.
[00:09:14.194 --> 00:09:15.154]  And MacArthur was right.
[00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:19.695]  We should have hit the Chinese with atomic weapons before they got them.
[00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:28.598]  We should have put a capitalist free market system in, and the world would be an incredibly better place.
[00:09:29.098 --> 00:09:34.080]  But the same old globalists, the same old people,
[00:09:37.628 --> 00:09:47.391]  Kept Communist China in place and let them now have a $900 billion trade deficit with us every year.
[00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:50.652]  That's not even all the intellectual property they steal.
[00:09:50.852 --> 00:09:53.593]  $300 billion of that $900 billion is a very conservative number.
[00:09:54.273 --> 00:09:55.214]  They steal everything.
[00:09:57.414 --> 00:10:01.116]  And now a more pragmatic system.
[00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:05.357]  Yes, it's all covered in the book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:08.429]  Now this is all unfolding.
[00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:17.715]  And you see pragmatic, reasonable action from this president, and I absolutely want to applaud it on every front.
[00:10:18.456 --> 00:10:30.984]  And I think it's a great thing, because the globalists through China have been propping North Korea up for a very, very, very long time.
[00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:35.767]  And now the meeting happened today, yesterday, in
[00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:39.414]  Korea Peninsula time.
[00:10:42.616 --> 00:10:43.256]  A big event.
[00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:54.921]  All of it after Trump put massive screws in the last year and a half to North Korea's thumbs and said, the next screws are going in your head.
[00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:59.282]  You're going to have a carpet of bombs or a carpet of gold.
[00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:01.203]  Stop what you're doing.
[00:11:02.864 --> 00:11:03.364]  Give it up.
[00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:09.451]  And then the word was they were going to hit them in March.
[00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:10.951]  U.S.
[00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:11.552]  was going 100%.
[00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:17.955]  The soldiers, the airmen, the military forces were told.
[00:11:19.977 --> 00:11:20.957]  The Marines were told.
[00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:24.979]  The Navy SEALs were told.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.581]  We're taking him out.
[00:11:29.862 --> 00:11:31.163]  And he got the message, didn't he?
[00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:40.024]  So now it's not, oh, we'll agree to meet with Bill Clinton or we'll agree to, you know, meet with some president secretly.
[00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:43.627]  No, we agree to end this whole thing now.
[00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:51.613]  And to ceremonially take plots of land from each side and put on the other for reunification.
[00:11:52.053 --> 00:11:57.358]  Guys, will you queue up the March 8th YouTube video?
[00:11:57.838 --> 00:11:58.639]  You can just search it.
[00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:02.482]  It's, uh, Kim Jong-un has already agreed to Trump's terms.
[00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:16.068]  And then I said that you would then see the meeting between the North and South, that they would announce a 10-year plan to begin integration, and that all of that would unfold.
[00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:21.530]  Just exactly as I told you, because we have great sources, and no one has given us credit.
[00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.431]  I tweeted out and the bots go, oh yeah, you're a liar.
[00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:28.171]  The deal wasn't made till later.
[00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:31.572]  The head of the CIA didn't meet till later.
[00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:34.638]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:12:34.698 --> 00:12:35.179]  Exclusive.
[00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:39.462]  Kim Jong-un has already agreed to Trump's terms ahead of meeting.
[00:12:47.287 --> 00:12:48.148]  I think it's in the computer.
[00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:48.668]  It's in the track.
[00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:49.969]  Yes, we play this about 10 times.
[00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:51.310]  We'll play it next segment.
[00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:54.092]  But the point is, is that
[00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:02.033]  I laid out exactly, word for word, what would happen in the exact order.
[00:13:02.713 --> 00:13:09.797]  Now either I'm a geopolitical genius, or I was told by high-level sources that knew exactly what was going on.
[00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:15.866]  Everybody knows we have these sources, but let's stop in the establishment media pretending we don't.
[00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:17.686]  You guys know the truth as well.
[00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:28.230]  You decide to lie about Trump and to say he's an idiot internationally, he's a buffoon at business, he's a loser, he's a moron, he's a punk, he's gonna kill us all.
[00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.731]  It's the Clintons and the globalists.
[00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:36.378]  That gave the nuclear weapons to Kim Jong-un.
[00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:37.719]  It wasn't even the Chinese.
[00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.880]  You people are out of control.
[00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:41.281]  You're the ones that are dangerous.
[00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:49.127]  Oh, but they've released hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of new text messages between the FBI agent Strzok and his little sweetie pie.
[00:13:49.727 --> 00:13:52.689]  And she sounds like a mentally ill basket case in my view.
[00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.131]  Whining and bitching.
[00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:56.992]  I saw him on TV.
[00:13:57.112 --> 00:13:57.932]  I'm so scared.
[00:13:58.132 --> 00:14:00.793]  We're meeting with generals about how to stop him.
[00:14:00.853 --> 00:14:03.134]  And, oh baby, I've got to go to this meeting.
[00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:04.195]  Oh, you have to go?
[00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:04.855]  That's dumb.
[00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:05.756]  I don't want to work.
[00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:09.037]  Now, honey, this is an important meeting about stopping Trump.
[00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:18.982]  Strock and Page Texts Reveal They Were Angry In Mourning Over James Comey Ouster.
[00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:23.244]  It's crazy.
[00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:40.366]  I mean, you're talking about, you know, they're putting in cry closets all over the country and Plato and construction paper, if you're upset, and when they catch people giving out pocket constitutions, Project Veritas and others caught this on video, they go into the dean and say, I'm scared.
[00:14:41.446 --> 00:14:44.168]  And they go, come in here, we've got Plato for you.
[00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:46.809]  And little stuffed animals.
[00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.812]  And people like roll around and go, oh, this is complete regression.
[00:14:54.053 --> 00:14:55.114]  Saw a headline a few years ago.
[00:14:56.415 --> 00:14:58.097]  That 35's the new adult.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.445]  I'm not Jewish, but I actually agree with Jewish views on that.
[00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:13.390]  13 years old, you treat somebody like they're an adult, you make them do adult chores, they're an adult at 13 on average.
[00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:19.435]  That doesn't mean they get to buy liquor or get married, but you start really treating them with the responsibilities.
[00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:28.950]  He was sent to apprentice in factories and oil rigs and offshore stuff and picking cotton.
[00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.332]  You know, just taking part in it.
[00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.574]  The whole nine yards, so he would be rounded.
[00:15:34.054 --> 00:15:37.497]  And by the time he was 10, he'd just get on a bus and go anywhere he wanted around the country.
[00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:40.980]  By the time he was 15, he was going to UT, Plan 2.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.121]  But that's because they treated him like an adult.
[00:15:43.702 --> 00:15:46.244]  He could skin a buck, run a trot line when he was 10 years old.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.881]  I was driving tractors and stuff when I was 10.
[00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:54.524]  Once or twice I did run through fences and things, but that's how that works.
[00:15:55.365 --> 00:16:00.889]  And when I was 10 years old, I could shoot a buck in the eye at 300 yards without the gun at rest.

[00:16:28.798 --> 00:16:29.419]  As you age,
[00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.199]  We all do.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.542]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[00:16:34.563 --> 00:16:35.984]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[00:16:36.184 --> 00:16:40.106]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:41.467]  And again, you look at the studies.
[00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:47.812]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:57.602]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[00:16:57.782 --> 00:17:05.928]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[00:17:06.028 --> 00:17:07.249]  It is Alpha Power.

[00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:17.537]  We're good.
[00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.374]  Desiree, thanks for holding your on the air from California.
[00:17:37.394 --> 00:17:37.675]  Go ahead.
[00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:41.720]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.866]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:17:47.387 --> 00:17:52.954]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[00:17:53.775 --> 00:18:02.017]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:05.578]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:18:06.258 --> 00:18:09.899]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:16.801]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:21.624]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:23.826]  How they're demonizing my state.
[00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:25.308]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:18:25.328 --> 00:18:30.292]  You have changed my life and for wars has changed my family's life.
[00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:36.377]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[00:18:36.437 --> 00:18:40.960]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:43.117]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:18:43.317 --> 00:18:48.619]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:49.999]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:50.179]  Yeah.
[00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:52.200]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.060]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.780]  We love you, and tell your husband we love him.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.781]  We really appreciate you.
[00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:56.841]  Keep up the fight.
[00:18:56.881 --> 00:18:58.301]  We need to take California back.
[00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:58.681]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:18:58.701 --> 00:18:59.782]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[00:18:59.822 --> 00:19:00.422]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:19:02.566 --> 00:19:05.347]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:19:05.987 --> 00:19:09.548]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:12.889]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:15.269]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:20.231]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:22.631]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:29.293]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:29.913 --> 00:19:37.138]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:42.762]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:19:43.163 --> 00:19:50.148]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:19:50.808 --> 00:19:55.271]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.553]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:19:58.653 --> 00:20:00.274]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.922]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.403 --> 00:20:51.210]  When those top government envoys and the South Korean intelligence chief met with Kim Jong-un last week for four hours at dinner, I have it from high-level sources that they laid out the proposals for the North if they denuclearize and actually stop their militaristic activities.
[00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.111]  And the South also offered a plan
[00:21:21.205 --> 00:21:22.146]  We're good to go.
[00:21:51.346 --> 00:21:51.826]  Who knows?
[00:21:52.607 --> 00:21:55.088]  But this is a big day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:55.408 --> 00:22:00.871]  The truth is, the Clintons and others gave them the reactors, gave them the missile secrets, to build them up as a threat, working with China.
[00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:04.152]  The globalists have been allied with China against America, playing a double game.
[00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:11.456]  Trump is ending that double game, because when he went to Saudi Arabia and said, you're not going to fund ISIS anymore, you're not going to fund al-Qaeda, you're going to free women.
[00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:20.160]  And they rolled over because the US and Britain had put the Saudis in power, Britain particularly,
[00:22:39.051 --> 00:22:41.211]  So that goes back into early March.
[00:22:43.492 --> 00:22:55.615]  There you go ladies and gentlemen and that's what I was told by sources and that's the plan and that's why we knew that it had a really good chance of being successful and now you're seeing it looks like if anything South Korea is accelerating
[00:22:56.653 --> 00:23:02.358]  What I was told over a month ago, that the plan is accelerating.
[00:23:02.758 --> 00:23:05.300]  And you notice about three weeks after I said all that, it came out in the news.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:16.389]  Kim Jong-un and North Korea already had to agree to the framework of what they were already agreeing to ahead of the meeting with Trump and the meetings with South Korea.
[00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:24.816]  And now you see it all going forward because North Korea wants to go ahead and not be the center of embarrassing evil.
[00:23:26.084 --> 00:23:28.745]  I don't play that to brag and say, see how smart I am.
[00:23:28.765 --> 00:23:32.026]  I play that to show you why they hate us, why they attack us, why they demonize us.
[00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:47.556]  You know CNN has way more sources than we do.
[00:23:48.557 --> 00:23:50.558]  CNN knows they're making a real peace deal.
[00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:56.502]  ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, they've all tried to stop this deal.
[00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:01.746]  They all know how real it is, and they're trying to sabotage it.
[00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:05.349]  Think about that.
[00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.572]  They're trying to say Trump's doing a terrible job.
[00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:10.933]  They're trying to say he's an idiot.
[00:24:11.553 --> 00:24:13.755]  They're trying to make this look as bad as it can,
[00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:29.300]  And to say that, oh, this isn't a good deal, and boy, Kim Jong-un's getting one over on us, and Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar says that, man, Trump's worse than North Korea.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:29.940]  He's an idiot.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.101]  He's going to blow us all up.
[00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:33.302]  They just said that a week ago.
[00:24:38.325 --> 00:24:42.727]  Because they're not living on the same planet as we are.
[00:24:45.461 --> 00:24:48.682]  Now, let's move on from there.
[00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:51.262]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up, and I've got a bunch of other news we need to hit.
[00:24:52.702 --> 00:24:55.383]  Sickening Amazon news.
[00:24:58.144 --> 00:25:14.947]  Just on every front, I was going through my financial stack of news, and it's just Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, Bezos, potato, patata, Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, boost fortune, $12 billion in a day on Amazon search.
[00:25:17.576 --> 00:25:18.737]  12 billion in a day.
[00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:25.660]  And his whole empire is based on $1.50 per package and all these other monopolies.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.821]  He personally pays almost no tax.
[00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:31.622]  That was in a London Guardian yesterday.
[00:25:32.903 --> 00:25:44.748]  But just remember, he funds the foundations and the liberal groups and was one of Obama's top supporters, telling the middle class that you should have a 45% federal tax, but you can't get out of it like he does.
[00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:48.181]  It's, and all these guys look like robots.
[00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:53.505]  Zuckerberg, Bezos, they don't, they look like androids.
[00:25:54.526 --> 00:25:56.927]  I'm not saying they're androids, but something's going on.
[00:25:56.947 --> 00:26:08.737]  There's that famous photo of Zuckerberg, up close, where his skin almost looks green, and you even see how the spots on his retinas are even identical.
[00:26:09.557 --> 00:26:15.622]  Very unusual to have that on both sides of each eye, identical, where the spots on the
[00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:18.469]  I don't know.
[00:26:35.307 --> 00:26:38.208]  It's that they're total psychopaths.
[00:26:38.749 --> 00:26:53.035]  They're known for hating their customers, hating their families, hating everyone, calling everyone dumb effers, and just savagely wanting every dime they can get, and just this will to dominate and run everybody else's lives.
[00:26:53.255 --> 00:26:56.277]  They're known for that, and they're our liberal gods.
[00:26:57.287 --> 00:27:06.392]  Converting everybody that you can't have a single family dwelling and that the average person by law should not be able to have more than 250 square feet.
[00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:12.016]  If you're in one of their controlled cities.
[00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:14.737]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:27:15.097 --> 00:27:21.561]  USA Today said it's time to get rid of single-family homes.
[00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:22.422]  It's bad for the earth.
[00:27:23.562 --> 00:27:24.723]  He is quarterbacking
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.324]  By the way, he puts out these photos himself in official PR releases.
[00:27:31.344 --> 00:27:35.288]  If you're watching on TV, these are photos Bezos puts out of himself.
[00:27:35.908 --> 00:27:37.910]  He has no idea what he looks like.
[00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.633]  Psychopaths and sociopaths have no idea.
[00:27:42.554 --> 00:27:50.475]  And he does this fake, tick, disarming laugh where he goes... There's an old NBC interview where he couldn't quit doing it.
[00:27:50.495 --> 00:27:52.256]  Does it like 50 times in 10 minutes.
[00:27:53.676 --> 00:27:55.496]  I'll find it during the break.
[00:27:55.816 --> 00:27:59.177]  It's like a 19 year old, like 1999 interview.
[00:27:59.197 --> 00:27:59.957]  NBC with Bezos.
[00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:14.158]  I meant to play that a few weeks ago.
[00:28:14.178 --> 00:28:16.359]  It is just Bizarro Land.
[00:28:30.263 --> 00:28:31.443]  He's trying to block the peace deals.
[00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.763]  And man, he wants to run your business out.
[00:28:34.803 --> 00:28:37.065]  I mean, he, because he's Bezos and he deserves it.
[00:28:37.325 --> 00:28:40.808]  He's going to own all the grocery stores and the rocket ships and everything.
[00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:41.448]  It's mine!
[00:28:41.548 --> 00:28:42.289]  I'm Bezos!
[00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.731]  You're going to live at 200 square feet!
[00:28:45.452 --> 00:28:46.212]  I feel big!
[00:28:46.232 --> 00:28:49.775]  I live on the top of a mountain in a 50,000 square foot home.
[00:28:50.456 --> 00:28:52.818]  I'm Bezos, master of the universe!
[00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:55.560]  Meanwhile, every device he puts out spies on you.
[00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:58.463]  Yahoo, Amazon, Alexa listens to you in your house.
[00:28:58.743 --> 00:28:59.484]  Oh, where'd I hear that?
[00:28:59.844 --> 00:29:00.425]  Three years ago.
[00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.231]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:05.792]  You can't survive without it.
[00:29:05.992 --> 00:29:06.892]  But where do you get it?
[00:29:07.192 --> 00:29:12.956]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:29:13.176 --> 00:29:18.899]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:35.949]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:38.469]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.030]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.070]  Easy assembly.
[00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.970]  Low maintenance.
[00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.070]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:07.197]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:08.698]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:30:08.758 --> 00:30:09.118]  Go ahead.
[00:30:09.218 --> 00:30:09.519]  Yes.
[00:30:09.939 --> 00:30:10.679]  Hi, Alex.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:16.984]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:30:17.184 --> 00:30:21.167]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:30:21.407 --> 00:30:22.848]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:30:23.228 --> 00:30:29.913]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:32.875]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:30:33.135 --> 00:30:36.538]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:30:36.838 --> 00:30:38.439]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:46.305]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:30:46.325 --> 00:30:52.129]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:57.593]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:30:57.673 --> 00:31:00.675]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:31:03.123 --> 00:31:03.844]  I'm so excited.
[00:31:03.864 --> 00:31:13.470]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:19.254]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:22.376]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:31.342]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:31:33.463 --> 00:31:38.247]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:31:38.768 --> 00:31:41.530]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:52.560]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.341]  It is amazing.
[00:31:55.743 --> 00:32:00.707]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:32:02.463 --> 00:32:06.966]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:18.693]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.

[00:32:42.091 --> 00:32:44.253]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.893 --> 00:33:35.417]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:36.397 --> 00:33:40.299]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.542]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:46.503]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.023 --> 00:33:52.606]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:56.748]  By now the fighting will be close.
[00:34:12.973 --> 00:34:13.533]  Welcome back!
[00:34:13.653 --> 00:34:15.335]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:18.076]  We're gonna plow into so much of the incredible news.
[00:34:18.317 --> 00:34:22.359]  A lot of it positive, a lot of it negative, a lot of it just downright insane.
[00:34:26.382 --> 00:34:35.568]  Bill Cosby convicted in sexual assault trial and I don't doubt that he did bad things and I'm not defending Bill Cosby.
[00:34:38.387 --> 00:34:51.336]  But a lot of the women are like, I was a cocktail waitress at Playboy for six years, and then I went up to a hotel room with him, and then I think he put something in my drink.
[00:34:51.857 --> 00:34:54.118]  And I think he probably did that.
[00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.339]  And it's horrible.
[00:34:58.682 --> 00:35:00.723]  But then they tell you about it 30 years, 40 years later.
[00:35:05.447 --> 00:35:05.927]  It's stupid.
[00:35:09.887 --> 00:35:11.649]  And why is the media bringing this up now?
[00:35:11.749 --> 00:35:23.138]  Because they want to drive a fissure between men and women and create a victimology in this country to put many women in the same headspace that many African Americans are.
[00:35:23.158 --> 00:35:36.750]  A victimology so they can be controlled by the whole Hillary movement that she created when she's one of the biggest abusers of women by proxy through the wars she's launched and the things she's done.
[00:35:38.254 --> 00:35:46.641]  And the radical Islamic group she's funded, and the pedophiles she's represented, the pedophiles she's protected, and the pedophiles that she is constantly around and vacationing with.
[00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:49.303]  It's stunning.
[00:35:50.504 --> 00:35:54.547]  But then that leads us to Tom Brokaw.
[00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.651]  And am I going to sue him?
[00:36:00.212 --> 00:36:01.193]  I've said I'm going to.
[00:36:01.213 --> 00:36:02.434]  I've already filed one suit.
[00:36:03.134 --> 00:36:03.795]  Others pending.
[00:36:04.315 --> 00:36:06.117]  They've already withdrawn the Charlottesville suit.
[00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:07.698]  No media coverage of that.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.002]  Then they just, like we predicted, filed another fake one yesterday.
[00:36:15.462 --> 00:36:21.846]  No coverage of that, because they don't want to go, oh God, they had to pull the last one and file another, and the lawyers have looked at it, and it's just as bad.
[00:36:23.867 --> 00:36:27.470]  My lawyers asked me, please stop telling them how bad it is.
[00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.451]  Just let these things go to court.
[00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:33.173]  They're pretty sure the law clinic, first-year law students are doing these.
[00:36:33.553 --> 00:36:36.675]  I mean, when they amended it, they just cut out giant paragraphs.
[00:36:37.516 --> 00:36:39.257]  Hacked in, where it doesn't even make sense.
[00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.111]  And that's what they refiled.
[00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:45.473]  It's next level.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:49.456]  Defamation.
[00:36:50.677 --> 00:36:51.898]  By proxy.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.624]  Where you don't publish a magazine article, you don't publish a book, you publish a 70 page lie.
[00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:00.966]  And a deception.
[00:37:01.687 --> 00:37:04.789]  So the media picks it up like, oh it's a lawsuit, it's true!
[00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.592]  Like the lawsuits that trumps a Russian agent.
[00:37:08.462 --> 00:37:10.383]  Well, if he is, we need more Russian agents, boy.
[00:37:10.824 --> 00:37:11.905]  Kicking the hell out of Russia.
[00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:13.205]  Cutting their energy off.
[00:37:13.346 --> 00:37:14.106]  Their energy sales.
[00:37:15.187 --> 00:37:16.328]  Surrounding them with military.
[00:37:18.749 --> 00:37:19.410]  Boy, I tell ya.
[00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.491]  The Russians must be suicidal.
[00:37:25.354 --> 00:37:31.999]  So one thing Trump's doing that's really wrong is sliding towards the neocon behavior with Russia and Syria and everything.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.300]  Along those lines.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.421]  North Korea thing's great.
[00:37:35.774 --> 00:37:46.357]  Actually, that's part of the math, part of the calculus to do the thing in Syria so Kim Jong-un knows that we speak very clearly and carry a big stick.
[00:37:47.358 --> 00:37:50.919]  But Tom Bruka is back in the news.
[00:37:50.939 --> 00:37:51.999]  In fact, can we queue him up?
[00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:53.580]  Calling me an unalloyed racist.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.560]  There's a bunch of these clips.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.461]  And then we've got a new name for him.
[00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.492]  Because what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[00:38:01.572 --> 00:38:04.874]  And the stew I'm cooking in is the stew you can cook in.
[00:38:05.354 --> 00:38:09.297]  And look, him calling me a complete, dedicated racist.
[00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:13.839]  That's what unalloyed means.
[00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:14.680]  It means complete.
[00:38:17.422 --> 00:38:14.680]  100%.
[00:38:19.943 --> 00:38:24.986]  But you could say Hitler was a unalloyed anti-Semite.
[00:38:25.546 --> 00:38:26.387]  That's a fair statement.
[00:38:27.796 --> 00:38:35.358]  To say that I'm a 100% racist is actionable, is defamation, even though I'm a public figure.
[00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:36.958]  We would win that case.
[00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:40.319]  But isn't he kind of winning it against himself?
[00:38:40.439 --> 00:38:42.299]  People know that's a load and a crock.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:52.802]  I mean, yeah, you'll find the occasional group of fascistic liberals that'll chant, Nazi, Nazi, get out, get out, to myself or Milo or dump coffee on your head.
[00:38:53.062 --> 00:38:54.242]  They're deranged people.
[00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:07.873]  Who've chosen to never even hear me say anything racist, but to just say I am so they get to dehumanize me and feel good as a gang coming after me.
[00:39:10.594 --> 00:39:20.917]  But Tom Brokaw has been accused of sexual harassment and being mean to a particular woman.
[00:39:23.397 --> 00:39:25.238]  Now, who knows if this is true?
[00:39:30.051 --> 00:39:32.373]  But, but, but, but, but she looks credible.
[00:39:32.753 --> 00:39:33.554]  We'll go to her club in a minute.
[00:39:33.574 --> 00:39:35.096]  We're going to first play the Unalloyed Racist Club.
[00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:36.817]  She sounds credible.
[00:39:38.258 --> 00:39:40.280]  And I know people that know Tom Brokaw.
[00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:43.183]  And they say he is a jerk.
[00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:45.865]  And that Tom Brokaw is arrogant.
[00:39:46.506 --> 00:39:48.047]  And that Tom Brokaw thinks he's God.
[00:39:48.067 --> 00:39:50.589]  Well here's the deal Tom Brokaw.
[00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:52.851]  Just like you look and behave like the Crypt Keeper.
[00:39:53.752 --> 00:39:55.554]  You're a perfect archetype.
[00:39:56.727 --> 00:40:02.332]  A signpost, a little scarecrow pointing towards hell for mainstream media and the fact that it's dead.
[00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:20.909]  And that they've had to roll you and Dan Rather out, and Brian Williams, you know, all of you frauds, with all the journalistic frauds you're well known for, you just hope people forget about all the fake stories you published, all the lies, Brokaw, all the terrible things you've done.
[00:40:22.915 --> 00:40:27.657]  But now, would it be fair to call Tom Brokaw an unalloyed rapist?
[00:40:29.597 --> 00:40:31.158]  An unalloyed harasser?
[00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:38.621]  You see, there's no evidence of me being the racist they say I am, but it's a buzzword.
[00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:41.281]  Right up there with being a child molester.
[00:40:42.582 --> 00:40:44.643]  Is Tom Brokaw a child molester?
[00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:46.883]  We know it's very popular in elite circles.
[00:40:47.964 --> 00:40:49.264]  I have no evidence he's a child molester.
[00:40:49.764 --> 00:40:51.065]  He looks like a child molester to me.
[00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:55.491]  Looks like a psychopath, looks like a criminal, looks like a piece of filth.
[00:40:56.312 --> 00:41:00.295]  But I'm not gonna say he's an unalloyed rapist, an unalloyed child molester.
[00:41:04.818 --> 00:41:06.919]  He looks like a vampire bat, actually.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.241]  He's a literal vampire bat.
[00:41:10.782 --> 00:41:14.985]  They'll have headlines, Jones claims Tom Brokaw is a literal vampire bat.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.921]  And Hillary is literally a demon.
[00:41:22.703 --> 00:41:27.065]  But I'm just saying, you know, that because he wanted to teach me how to be mean.
[00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:43.572]  Well, you're gonna be shoveled into your old stinking grave soon, you lying anti-American globalist sack of crap that writes all these books about how you love our military and love this country, you little vampire bat, you little blood-sucking worm.
[00:41:44.693 --> 00:41:56.147]  You'll be shoveled into your grave soon enough and metaphysically with all the other old fake rotting carcass of the mainstream media, you sickening degenerate maggot head.
[00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:58.189]  How you like that, you old punk?
[00:42:00.112 --> 00:42:00.833]  You old bully?
[00:42:02.114 --> 00:42:03.616]  Here, let's go to his Unalloyed Races Club.
[00:42:03.636 --> 00:42:03.916]  Here it is.
[00:42:04.892 --> 00:42:09.074]  I'm gonna come back with now the allegations that he's a brutal harasser.
[00:42:09.094 --> 00:42:09.534]  But first...
[00:42:36.445 --> 00:42:38.045]  We'll have this break and return.
[00:42:39.086 --> 00:42:40.366]  And notice they just recycled that.
[00:42:40.626 --> 00:42:43.887]  They've got videos of me three, four years ago saying, I believe Newtown happened.
[00:42:44.307 --> 00:42:44.787]  They don't care.
[00:42:44.827 --> 00:42:46.488]  They say, he keeps bullying the parents.
[00:42:46.688 --> 00:42:47.908]  He keeps saying it didn't happen.
[00:42:47.948 --> 00:42:54.290]  No, you're saying it, along with Megyn Kelly, who's plunging in the ratings and is about to get her butt fired.
[00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.430]  What an embarrassment both of you are.
[00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.071]  Your expiration date's up, brother.
[00:42:59.111 --> 00:43:01.832]  Not because you're old, but because you're a soulless piece of garbage.
[00:43:02.452 --> 00:43:09.077]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:09.758 --> 00:43:11.559]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:18.004]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:18.424 --> 00:43:21.046]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.326 --> 00:43:24.348]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:30.651]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:31.271 --> 00:43:37.735]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:44.017]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:44.477 --> 00:43:48.078]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:48.578 --> 00:43:56.781]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.181 --> 00:44:03.143]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:08.907]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[00:44:09.527 --> 00:44:17.609]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.169 --> 00:44:19.850]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:27.312]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:27.372 --> 00:44:30.372]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:31.853]  It's not absorbable.
[00:44:32.233 --> 00:44:32.793]  It's toxic.
[00:44:33.513 --> 00:44:39.879]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:45.625]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:45.745 --> 00:44:48.267]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:48.988 --> 00:44:57.373]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[00:44:57.573 --> 00:45:01.536]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:01.956 --> 00:45:06.659]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:10.801]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:14.964]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:18.286]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:18.326 --> 00:45:19.447]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:19.888 --> 00:45:21.229]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:21.669 --> 00:45:23.971]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.011 --> 00:45:27.233]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:27.654 --> 00:45:31.056]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:31.517 --> 00:45:33.638]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:35.360]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:43.086]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:43.386 --> 00:45:44.247]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:44.847 --> 00:45:45.007]  Yeah.
[00:45:59.964 --> 00:46:00.385]  I don't think so.
[00:46:16.423 --> 00:46:17.584]  That we can work this out.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.523]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.

[00:46:47.672 --> 00:46:51.997]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:46:52.417 --> 00:46:58.984]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:09.073]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:34.114]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:50.174]  Well, the vampire bat of media, Tom Brokaw, has been accused of vicious sexual harassment while at his perch.
[00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:55.496]  And he just doesn't know, doesn't know what to do.
[00:47:57.705 --> 00:48:02.549]  But we were talking about Bezos and his weird neurotic laugh that he now tries to keep under control.
[00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:13.638]  And it was funny, when the stars aligned, they found a clip of him doing the neurotic laugh while talking about Tom Brokaw in between eating cockroaches.
[00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:14.899]  I'm not kidding.
[00:48:14.919 --> 00:48:19.182]  If you're watching on TV or seeing all this, let's go ahead and roll that clip from, what, 1999.
[00:48:19.323 --> 00:48:20.604]  Here it is.
[00:48:21.224 --> 00:48:24.807]  The best-selling book at Amazon.com has been The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw.
[00:48:24.827 --> 00:48:26.208]  You think we're going to put that on television?
[00:48:29.541 --> 00:48:29.941]  I don't know.
[00:48:29.961 --> 00:48:31.902]  It'll be a test of your credibility.
[00:48:31.922 --> 00:48:36.166]  A while ago... That's enough.
[00:48:36.466 --> 00:48:39.608]  The interview is 15 minutes of that, and that's not even really the crazy ones.
[00:48:40.489 --> 00:48:41.249]  It's really wild.
[00:48:41.289 --> 00:48:45.533]  He's hopping around like... And it's all a complete act.
[00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:51.277]  Now, let's get back to Tom Brokaw saying I'm this unalloyed racist, which means total complete. 100%.
[00:48:56.397 --> 00:49:18.948]  So, this vampire bat, when he's hanging upside down, crapping on America with little bits of fake news guano that are dropping on our heads, he wants to cash in on veterans, cash in on the greatest generation, trying to make himself that, when he is an anti-American globalist that has been feeding at the throat of this country for 40 years, covering up globalism, the New World Order, all of it.
[00:49:19.188 --> 00:49:21.570]  So this is kind of the posthumous award to
[00:49:25.472 --> 00:49:27.133]  This gentleman right now, Tom Brokaw.
[00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:33.336]  Because they're all a bunch of fake news individuals and they're all politically and culturally dead.
[00:49:33.496 --> 00:49:34.816]  They just don't know it yet.
[00:49:35.397 --> 00:49:37.738]  So maybe he's not a vampire bat even though he kind of looks like one.
[00:49:38.118 --> 00:49:39.538]  He's a zombie.
[00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:41.659]  Walking dead.
[00:49:41.719 --> 00:49:42.580]  Nobody gave him the memo.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:49.683]  So here's the latest on the fact that some are saying, not me, that he's an unalloyed rapist.
[00:49:49.723 --> 00:49:50.103]  Here it is.
[00:49:50.684 --> 00:49:51.184]  Linda Vester.
[00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:57.258]  For a decade, I worked at NBC News as an anchor and correspondent.
[00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:05.583]  I was groped and assaulted by Tom Brokaw, then the anchor of NBC Nightly News.
[00:50:06.944 --> 00:50:07.724]  This is my story.
[00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:21.806]  I was a brand new, newly hired correspondent for NBC News for Weekend Today.
[00:50:22.707 --> 00:50:27.951]  And I was sent to Denver in August of 93 to cover the Pope's trip there.
[00:50:28.432 --> 00:50:39.361]  And while I was standing in the Denver Bureau with my back to the door, from behind me, out of nowhere, Tom Brokaw walked up.
[00:50:40.642 --> 00:50:44.185]  Put his hands on my waist and tickled me all up and down my waist.
[00:50:44.786 --> 00:50:47.548]  It was physically unpleasant and humiliating.
[00:50:48.249 --> 00:50:48.989]  I jumped afoot.
[00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:54.974]  I don't want to show this because there's kids watching but have you seen a vampire bat feed?
[00:50:55.755 --> 00:51:03.081]  That's they fly in from behind land and then they actually tickle with their tongue so that so you don't get upset and then they have a little teeth.
[00:51:03.341 --> 00:51:06.003]  They cut a ring and then lap the blood.
[00:51:06.384 --> 00:51:09.086]  So see he's not guilty of sexual harassment.
[00:51:10.492 --> 00:51:12.534]  I can tell you, he was trying to get some food.
[00:51:13.935 --> 00:51:16.117]  And you know, you shouldn't deny people starving to death.
[00:51:16.517 --> 00:51:17.178]  He was hungry.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.363]  But this lady doesn't understand he was hungry!
[00:51:23.444 --> 00:51:25.806]  Show some basic respect, lady.
[00:51:25.986 --> 00:51:26.767]  Let's go back to it.
[00:51:28.568 --> 00:51:33.293]  ...of nightly news in the eye, he looked back at me and his jaw dropped.
[00:51:34.454 --> 00:51:36.836]  And I was... Now hit pause!
[00:51:38.649 --> 00:51:43.792]  Because once they start salivating to keep the blood from coagulating, they can't keep their mouth closed.
[00:51:44.552 --> 00:51:49.515]  Once they start feeding until they've gorged their little bellies, you don't... Yeah, let's show some of this.
[00:51:50.135 --> 00:51:51.256]  Being so mean to him.
[00:51:51.316 --> 00:51:53.617]  Imagine he just flapped on over their little belly.
[00:51:53.957 --> 00:51:54.698]  He was hungry.
[00:51:55.218 --> 00:51:56.539]  Yeah, let's watch some feeding time.
[00:51:57.419 --> 00:51:57.959]  There you go.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.042]  So, this lady doesn't understand what she was dealing with.
[00:52:02.302 --> 00:52:04.183]  And I'm sorry for actually what she went through.
[00:52:06.104 --> 00:52:07.885]  You know, those even come up to the edge of South Texas.
[00:52:09.565 --> 00:52:13.646]  You walk out in your barn and five or six of those are on top of your horse, your cow, it's not a good deal.
[00:52:14.386 --> 00:52:16.647]  But what happens when they're a top anchor at NBC News?
[00:52:16.887 --> 00:52:17.087]  Huh?
[00:52:17.547 --> 00:52:19.327]  The whole time masquerading as a human.
[00:52:19.907 --> 00:52:20.548]  Let's continue.
[00:52:21.548 --> 00:52:24.548]  Humiliated in front of a room full of my colleagues.
[00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:28.049]  I jumped, got out of the way, got out of his grasp.
[00:52:29.009 --> 00:52:29.750]  No one did a thing.
[00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.631]  And there was really nothing I could say or do because I was so low on the totem pole.
[00:52:36.843 --> 00:52:43.595]  That I had just had to get out of there as quickly as possible and try to go on and do my job covering the Pope.
[00:52:45.739 --> 00:52:48.203]  That's just an excerpt of her big variety interview.
[00:52:48.304 --> 00:52:49.526]  And to be serious, I believe her.
[00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:52.449]  And mammals are mammals.
[00:52:52.749 --> 00:52:54.930]  If men and women like each other, that's their issue.
[00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:56.992]  If she didn't like it, he should never have done it again.
[00:52:58.753 --> 00:53:01.455]  And obviously, I'm not literally saying he's a vampire bat.
[00:53:01.715 --> 00:53:03.116]  But they'll edit that together and put it on.
[00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:03.396]  It's okay.
[00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:05.078]  He is the vampire bat now.
[00:53:05.518 --> 00:53:06.238]  Tom Brokaw.
[00:53:06.299 --> 00:53:08.640]  And if you look at his face, the nose kind of points up and everything.
[00:53:09.141 --> 00:53:11.742]  That happens from years of having your face down in the meat.
[00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:15.925]  And then the nose kind of bends up when you're slobbering along, you know, getting your dinner.
[00:53:16.926 --> 00:53:18.387]  And that's what happens.
[00:53:20.523 --> 00:53:22.443]  This is called satire, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:22.463 --> 00:53:23.704]  I'm having a little bit of fun here.
[00:53:23.724 --> 00:53:25.224]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:53:25.264 --> 00:53:40.748]  If you're a new viewer on all our great new TV affiliates across the country, please tell your circle of friends, your neighbors, people randomly, hey, Alex Jones is on Channel X. He's on Channel Y. He's on Channel A. Because it's exciting.
[00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:47.169]  You see, all these TV stations have two or three or four sub-carriers now on the digital band.
[00:53:48.772 --> 00:53:53.054]  And they can just put us on 24 hours a day, that's what the stations all want, just to fill those.
[00:53:53.114 --> 00:53:54.255]  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:55.175]  We're free to air.
[00:53:55.996 --> 00:53:57.036]  You can take all the commercials.
[00:53:57.716 --> 00:54:01.458]  If you are a TV station, you can't with radio, but you can still work with GCN.
[00:54:01.478 --> 00:54:05.400]  I like GCN, but I've thought about not working with them, just so I can say, hey, the ads are all radio stations.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.821]  Wow, that'd be a nice incentive, wouldn't it?
[00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:08.482]  But we'll see.
[00:54:08.902 --> 00:54:17.166]  I'm a very loyal person, but I've just been using them as a syndicator for a while, and I just want to go free to air for everybody, do something no one's ever done in talk radio, in commercial talk radio.
[00:54:19.315 --> 00:54:24.600]  I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen, to all the TV stations and cable stations, you name it.
[00:54:26.341 --> 00:54:27.142]  Free to air, baby.
[00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:32.407]  And we're up to 10 hours live every day, some days.
[00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:33.836]  More.
[00:54:34.216 --> 00:54:36.277]  We're trying to add more broadcasts, trying to add more hubs.
[00:54:36.297 --> 00:54:38.999]  We're building up the infrastructure while we're under globalist attack.
[00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:40.279]  I'm not complaining.
[00:54:40.419 --> 00:54:42.900]  It's an animating contest, but we need your support.
[00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.141]  Now, the next hour will be more serious.
[00:54:45.341 --> 00:54:46.882]  We had some serious North Korea news earlier.
[00:54:46.922 --> 00:54:47.582]  Very good news.
[00:54:48.263 --> 00:54:50.084]  Record coming together, the North and South.
[00:54:50.144 --> 00:54:54.265]  Trump, just spectacular job changing course and it's really delivering.
[00:54:54.285 --> 00:54:55.546]  So let's pray for peace there.
[00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:57.247]  Some really bad news when it comes to
[00:54:59.082 --> 00:55:03.204]  Iran, they're really a big issue and making a lot of threats and Mattis is talking about that.
[00:55:04.585 --> 00:55:07.006]  Crime rates skyrocketing and culturally enriched.
[00:55:07.106 --> 00:55:11.269]  Britain, now higher than New York and other cities in the U.S.
[00:55:12.489 --> 00:55:17.212]  More on Bill Cosby, who I guess is an unalloyed rapist.
[00:55:17.252 --> 00:55:18.913]  He's a convicted unalloyed rapist.
[00:55:20.254 --> 00:55:27.538]  I don't take pleasure in that because Bill Cosby was more of a conservative individual and you notice he got conservative the last decade publicly and they didn't like that.
[00:55:28.871 --> 00:55:31.674]  And I know some folks that know Bill Cosby, known him a long time.
[00:55:31.694 --> 00:55:33.435]  They say he's a gentleman, super nice to everybody.
[00:55:36.498 --> 00:55:40.321]  But, a woman says that, you know, you took him in the house and gave him a Quaalude or whatever.
[00:55:40.862 --> 00:55:43.104]  I've never even seen a Quaalude, but some kind of pill.
[00:55:44.245 --> 00:55:45.826]  Some kind of like barbiturate or something?
[00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:46.367]  I don't know.
[00:55:46.947 --> 00:55:49.009]  And that's the end of it.
[00:55:49.089 --> 00:55:49.810]  So there you go.
[00:55:51.786 --> 00:55:59.472]  You know, I just have a little bit of a jaundice eye at all this because I've had people accuse me of things that are 110% totally false.
[00:56:00.593 --> 00:56:07.619]  In that EEOC complaint, it says, Jones never said anything sexual to me, but I felt like he was gay grooming me.
[00:56:09.141 --> 00:56:19.129]  How am I supposed to sit there with a straight face and talk to somebody who wants to have mediation with me and go, okay, I never said anything sexual, but you felt like it.
[00:56:21.943 --> 00:56:22.803]  That's next level.
[00:56:23.864 --> 00:56:25.425]  That's next level.
[00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.066]  Now it's, I felt like it.
[00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:31.508]  Did you feel like a little wind blew behind your back?
[00:56:31.548 --> 00:56:33.229]  Maybe Casper the Friendly Ghost flew by too?
[00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.351]  I mean, it's next level.
[00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:39.172]  Seriously folks, Infowarstore.com.
[00:56:40.393 --> 00:56:41.974]  That's how we battle all this garbage.
[00:56:42.114 --> 00:56:43.314]  We're bringing America back.
[00:56:43.354 --> 00:56:44.295]  We're bringing freedom back.
[00:56:44.315 --> 00:56:45.515]  We're bringing Americana back.
[00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.036]  We're bringing it all back, baby.
[00:56:47.056 --> 00:56:50.078]  And they hate us and they think if they can knock us down, they can knock anybody down.
[00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.862]  Big sales are going to have to end next week.
[00:56:54.042 --> 00:56:55.383]  A lot of them this weekend.
[00:56:55.403 --> 00:56:56.564]  50% off Super Mill Vitality.
[00:56:57.004 --> 00:56:59.746]  25% off Rainforest, the best-selling nootropic.
[00:56:59.766 --> 00:57:04.869]  25% off X2 Survival Shield, the purest iodine that we know of anybody can even get close to.
[00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:09.132]  And it's a rare earth, deep, deep earth crystal.
[00:57:10.273 --> 00:57:10.733]  It's pure.
[00:57:12.114 --> 00:57:13.355]  And it's very hard to get.
[00:57:13.635 --> 00:57:15.556]  That's why we can't find anybody else that's got it.
[00:57:15.576 --> 00:57:17.878]  I've been trying for two years as another supplier.
[00:57:18.755 --> 00:57:20.577]  So that group with his proprietary deal can make it?
[00:57:21.158 --> 00:57:23.721]  And, I mean, I remember saying years ago, no, I can't find anybody else to get it from.
[00:57:24.042 --> 00:57:25.163]  We looked, big time.
[00:57:25.183 --> 00:57:32.652]  We've got people that are big procurers for some of the largest companies in the country, and I said, no, it's all signed off in contracts for pharmaceutical production.
[00:57:32.992 --> 00:57:34.154]  It's a precursor to a lot of things.
[00:57:34.394 --> 00:57:35.335]  It's a controlled substance.
[00:57:35.896 --> 00:57:37.878]  Actually, pure iodine before it's been put into the palm oil.
[00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:41.460]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.442]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:46.242]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:58:04.741 --> 00:58:08.263]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:58:08.883 --> 00:58:20.128]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:31.530]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.

[00:58:52.655 --> 00:59:02.838]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:59:03.058 --> 00:59:09.983]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:10.143 --> 00:59:14.847]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:15.027 --> 00:59:21.712]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:21.812 --> 00:59:28.898]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.719]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:59:30.879 --> 00:59:35.842]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:36.003 --> 00:59:40.366]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:40.486 --> 00:59:43.748]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:43.888 --> 00:59:50.012]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:50.192 --> 00:59:51.853]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:57.503 --> 00:59:58.384]  It's mind control.
[00:59:58.424 --> 00:59:59.345]  Mind control.
[00:59:59.365 --> 01:00:01.227]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[01:00:01.247 --> 01:00:02.809]  Destruction of your soul.
[01:00:22.637 --> 01:00:26.220]  Winn Biggley, that's his new best-selling book about Trumpisms and more.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.142]  Scott Adams joins us for the next 30-40 minutes or so.
[01:00:29.683 --> 01:00:31.985]  Dilbert.com, blog.dilbert.com.
[01:00:32.565 --> 01:00:43.975]  Wow, he has just been a free thinker, and he has been somebody outside the box and trying to get people to not just go off what the spin is, but what the facts are.
[01:00:44.035 --> 01:00:45.636]  He's called it the fact-free world.
[01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:51.121]  But maybe we're going to the golden age, like he said, where it'll be more about the facts than knowing about our own emotions.
[01:00:52.034 --> 01:00:56.237]  And so he has been at the center of the firestorm with Kanye West.
[01:00:56.798 --> 01:00:58.239]  Thousands of articles a day.
[01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:01.121]  Millions of people extra watching his videos.
[01:01:03.203 --> 01:01:05.585]  He played his latest video a few days ago here on air.
[01:01:05.605 --> 01:01:11.109]  We're going to go to break in a minute and come back with Scott Adams joining us live via Skype.
[01:01:11.449 --> 01:01:13.871]  But they are melting down about this.
[01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:15.833]  And I see it as a major turning point.
[01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:20.256]  As he said, Kanye West blew a hole in reality when he did this.
[01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.798]  Just like Scott Adams blew maybe a little smaller hole.
[01:01:22.858 --> 01:01:24.219]  And I blew a smaller hole.
[01:01:24.239 --> 01:01:25.460]  But all of us blowing little holes.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.743]  Now Kanye blowing a bigger, much larger hole.
[01:01:29.657 --> 01:01:45.612]  Okay, Candace Owens doing that, shaking the authoritarians and showing us just how authoritarian they are, that this is a big deal in America, that Kanye West can be friends with Trump for over a decade and say he supports him, right as Trump with Korea and so many other things has big victories.
[01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:50.677]  So here's a few minutes of the viral video is Kanye West bringing us into the Golden Age.
[01:01:50.717 --> 01:01:52.239]  And what is the Golden Age?
[01:01:55.336 --> 01:02:01.521]  So, we humans have developed a number of prisons of the mind.
[01:02:02.342 --> 01:02:11.169]  Things that we just imagine to be our limitations were imagined to be true, and it limits what we think is possible, and it limits what choices we make.
[01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:13.350]  Here are two of the biggest ones.
[01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:14.992]  I talk about this a lot.
[01:02:15.452 --> 01:02:18.474]  It's the false belief that history repeats.
[01:02:20.856 --> 01:02:21.257]  It doesn't.
[01:02:22.248 --> 01:02:22.808]  It never does.
[01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:26.990]  It just looks like it because we have this pattern recognition brain.
[01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:31.853]  So anytime we see anything that reminds us of another thing, we say, well, there it is.
[01:02:31.973 --> 01:02:33.053]  History repeating again.
[01:02:34.014 --> 01:02:35.054]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:02:35.595 --> 01:02:39.076]  History can't repeat because all the variables are changing all the time.
[01:02:39.537 --> 01:02:42.958]  So you can't ever have the same starting point you ever had in history.
[01:02:43.599 --> 01:02:45.539]  History never repeats.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:46.500]  Ever.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.062]  If you think it does, you're in a mental prison.
[01:02:51.224 --> 01:02:56.188]  If you think it doesn't, do you know what happens if you think that history doesn't repeat?
[01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:03.154]  Then you can become President of the United States without ever being a politician.
[01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:08.099]  If you believe that history repeats, you don't even try.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.683]  President Trump is not in a mental prison.
[01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:16.759]  Did he think that North Korea was unsolvable?
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.540]  Nope.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.562]  Did he think he couldn't negotiate trade deals?
[01:03:20.722 --> 01:03:21.583]  Nope, he didn't think that.
[01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:25.506]  Did he think he couldn't give people nicknames and win an election that way?
[01:03:26.267 --> 01:03:27.347]  With other stuff, of course.
[01:03:27.748 --> 01:03:27.908]  Nope.
[01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:35.874]  Did he think he could, you know, that nobody could talk about immigration without being labeled a racist and therefore, you know, their life was over?
[01:03:36.575 --> 01:03:37.515]  Didn't seem to bother him.
[01:03:38.956 --> 01:03:43.180]  He consistently shows you that history doesn't repeat.
[01:03:44.679 --> 01:03:45.466]  Where do you get that?
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.441]  Well, probably.
[01:03:47.461 --> 01:03:49.863]  It traces back to the same place I got it.
[01:03:50.644 --> 01:03:52.185]  The power of positive thinking.
[01:03:52.445 --> 01:03:58.430]  Remember, his pastor when he was a kid was Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote The Power of Positive Thinking.
[01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:02.674]  The Power of Positive Thinking is very close to this.
[01:04:03.294 --> 01:04:08.799]  It's very close to thinking, to the belief that you're not in a mental prison.
[01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:10.681]  History doesn't define you.
[01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:14.544]  You know, you can get out of that little mental prison.
[01:04:16.169 --> 01:04:19.392]  Here's another one that I like to look at.
[01:04:19.592 --> 01:04:21.594]  This is another mental prison, alright?
[01:04:22.374 --> 01:04:25.697]  That the problem has to be the solution.
[01:04:26.258 --> 01:04:28.740]  Now this will require some explaining, alright?
[01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:34.305]  But it's a mental trap, it's a prison, if you think that the only solution...
[01:04:35.598 --> 01:04:40.642]  Alright, we'll be back with the man himself, ladies and gentlemen, Scott Adams of blog.dilbert.com.
[01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:47.087]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com, and of course, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.com.
[01:04:47.127 --> 01:04:51.951]  And isn't it great now, from his kitchen, he can end up getting more viewers than ABC Nightly News.
[01:04:52.331 --> 01:04:53.812]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:04:54.313 --> 01:04:58.416]  That's why they're trying to say get rid of free speech, because they already realize the genie's out of the bottle.
[01:04:58.956 --> 01:05:00.858]  Too late, control freaks, too late.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.502]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:05:06.962 --> 01:05:08.263]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:20.290]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:26.073]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:29.876]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:29.896 --> 01:05:36.140]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:05:36.361 --> 01:05:41.024]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:43.846]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:05:44.187 --> 01:05:45.528]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:45.928 --> 01:05:50.812]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:05:51.032 --> 01:05:55.499]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:55.639 --> 01:05:57.802]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:03.190]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:06:30.268 --> 01:06:32.370]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:32.891 --> 01:06:38.056]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:40.338 --> 01:06:51.850]  By the way, on the heels of the big North Korea peace deal to denuclearize and basically begin the process of merging the two countries, a huge victory by Trump getting outside the box, believing that
[01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:57.354]  You don't solve problems, as Scott Adams was saying, with the same problem.
[01:06:58.135 --> 01:07:04.961]  Well, they might not mind that, because they've moved on to Stormy Daniels and Trump's lawyer and women.
[01:07:04.982 --> 01:07:05.642]  All of that directed by Mueller.
[01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:06.383]  Unbelievable.
[01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:20.513]  Trump calls Russian investigation a witch hunt after it finds no evidence of collusion.
[01:07:20.573 --> 01:07:21.614]  The collusion's by Hillary.
[01:07:21.894 --> 01:07:27.358]  But Scott Adams sarcastically during the campaign said, I am now a Hillary supporter so they don't kill me.
[01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:33.222]  Well I guess it wasn't too sarcastic, but I guess it was real, but it was done tongue-in-cheek.
[01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.644]  Talk about courage.
[01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.524]  That's who I admire.
[01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:40.008]  Not just folks that are right, because I admire people that are smart and know what they're talking about, but people who have courage.
[01:07:40.428 --> 01:07:43.870]  You add those together, that's called game-changing, that's called trailblazing.
[01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:45.692]  Do I agree with him that history doesn't repeat?
[01:07:47.008 --> 01:08:03.085]  Well, times come when there's renaissance and people stop repeating, but a lot of times we get in these staid systems where people do follow the power structure, do follow the staid political system, so the same group stays in power, so they repeat the same basic activities.
[01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:03.625]  But he's right.
[01:08:03.765 --> 01:08:05.827]  They're not literally repeating the same thing.
[01:08:06.308 --> 01:08:07.849]  But then there are these renaissance points.
[01:08:08.933 --> 01:08:12.654]  That I believe do cause these giant leaps forward.
[01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:14.894]  But he's laid out this golden age.
[01:08:14.934 --> 01:08:17.155]  I think we've been in it since the Gutenberg press.
[01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:19.175]  I think it's been tumultuous.
[01:08:19.215 --> 01:08:19.896]  It's been problems.
[01:08:19.936 --> 01:08:22.016]  But look at all the good things happening with the bad.
[01:08:22.056 --> 01:08:24.717]  But what could the end of the golden age bring us into?
[01:08:24.737 --> 01:08:25.817]  The age of infinity?
[01:08:26.157 --> 01:08:27.197]  We'll talk some about that.
[01:08:27.697 --> 01:08:32.959]  So Scott Emms, congratulations on getting the whole world really thinking about shifting paradigms.
[01:08:32.999 --> 01:08:34.299]  And thanks for spending time with us.
[01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:36.364]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:08:36.384 --> 01:08:39.526]  You know, everybody, my critics told me that I can't talk to you.
[01:08:39.666 --> 01:08:40.326]  You know that, right?
[01:08:41.206 --> 01:08:47.929]  They attacked me and said, he's been on InfoWars, so we can't listen to anything he says that might be productive and useful.
[01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:51.650]  But I say, Kanye changed everything.
[01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.031]  And, you know, I can love you.
[01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:55.392]  I don't have to disagree with you.
[01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:59.753]  So I'm going to take Kanye's lead and say, I'm Switzerland.
[01:08:59.933 --> 01:09:03.835]  I'll go on whatever show wants me to talk to their audience and share my opinion.
[01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:07.002]  Which is a fundamental Americana idea.
[01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:07.943]  I mean, let's speak to that.
[01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:13.446]  This new thing where, plus they lie about who I am and what I say when they tell you don't come on the show.
[01:09:13.467 --> 01:09:16.148]  And they want to control who can communicate, who can talk.
[01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:17.229]  That sounds like a prison.
[01:09:18.849 --> 01:09:20.151]  Yeah, prison of the mind.
[01:09:21.593 --> 01:09:25.959]  The moment you can't associate and deal with people, you've got problems.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:35.392]  Speaking of North Korea, let's not forget the enormous psychological benefit that Dennis Rodman brought to this situation.
[01:09:36.004 --> 01:09:40.368]  Because if you think about it, you know, he's as out of the box as you can get.
[01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:41.609]  And what did he do?
[01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:45.653]  He associated with someone that everybody said, don't associate with him.
[01:09:45.713 --> 01:09:46.394]  You can't do that.
[01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:48.696]  And Dennis Rodman said, watch me.
[01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:50.276]  Watch me go do this.
[01:09:50.996 --> 01:10:03.266]  And I'm pretty sure that the Dennis Rodman experience probably was part of the calculation that we understood Kim Jong-un to be a rational player who had at least a little fondness for the West.
[01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:08.250]  So Dennis Rodman, Presidential Medal of Freedom?
[01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:09.451]  Maybe.
[01:10:10.572 --> 01:10:13.935]  If things work out, I think his name's got to be in that conversation.
[01:10:15.768 --> 01:10:17.208]  I've got to apologize, Dennis Rodman.
[01:10:17.288 --> 01:10:19.469]  I didn't see it the way you saw it then.
[01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:23.570]  And I just saw the freakish nature and the crimes committed by North Korea.
[01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:32.212]  But keeping them in the communist position, if we don't reform them and don't work with them, we become the oppressors by keeping them in our minds being the devil.
[01:10:32.472 --> 01:10:34.253]  Is that what you're talking about, about mental prisons?
[01:10:35.513 --> 01:10:41.995]  Yeah, and think about the fact that we like to say, oh, don't give oxygen to this bad person or this bad idea.
[01:10:42.754 --> 01:10:44.135]  But it's not giving oxygen.
[01:10:44.155 --> 01:10:45.635]  It's bringing in another voice.
[01:10:45.955 --> 01:10:47.136]  It's bringing in an influence.
[01:10:47.216 --> 01:10:52.298]  It's bringing in a persuasion that could change that thing you're not liking to something you might like a little bit better.
[01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:57.520]  So Dennis Rodman was not endorsing North Korea.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.440]  He was bringing persuasion.
[01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:03.322]  And it may have been an important part of progress.
[01:11:03.962 --> 01:11:04.682]  Why didn't I see that?
[01:11:04.722 --> 01:11:08.964]  It was like bringing Coca-Cola, rock and roll, and Levi's blue jeans into Russia.
[01:11:08.984 --> 01:11:10.705]  I admit, Scott,
[01:11:11.593 --> 01:11:12.433]  I missed the boat on that.
[01:11:13.114 --> 01:11:14.674]  Wow.
[01:11:14.754 --> 01:11:16.515]  Well, go back to your Constitution, right?
[01:11:16.535 --> 01:11:21.797]  This whole freedom of speech business, it's a big, big idea, and it keeps working.
[01:11:22.137 --> 01:11:27.139]  Like, every time we get a little more freedom of speech, people are a little happier and they act surprised.
[01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.560]  It's like, whoa, freedom of speech worked again.
[01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:30.721]  Surprise.
[01:11:31.141 --> 01:11:36.483]  So, Kanye is reminding us something I guess we forgot.
[01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:41.065]  Dennis Rodman reminded us of something I think we forgot.
[01:11:41.995 --> 01:11:44.937]  Uh, you know, Candace Owens is also part of the conversation.
[01:11:44.957 --> 01:11:57.385]  They're reminding us of the power of free, you know, free thought, free speech, the ability to talk to the people who are not your best friend, you know, the ability to talk to somebody without saying you can't talk to them.
[01:11:57.885 --> 01:12:00.907]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[01:12:01.207 --> 01:12:03.349]  And what I define as the golden age
[01:12:04.213 --> 01:12:08.535]  is a realization that most of our problems are no longer physical.
[01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:12.617]  As in, I have the plague and I don't have a cure.
[01:12:12.657 --> 01:12:13.978]  That's a physical problem.
[01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:17.019]  I don't have enough resources.
[01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:18.360]  I don't have enough food.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.540]  That's a physical problem.
[01:12:20.061 --> 01:12:25.003]  But North Korea, we're starting to understand, was always a psychological problem.
[01:12:25.023 --> 01:12:28.665]  Because the solution was there, we just had to figure it out.
[01:12:29.285 --> 01:12:34.731]  I believe the same is true with issues with Iran.
[01:12:35.252 --> 01:12:44.622]  I think we can get to a good place with them if we take the same mindset that we can talk to them, we can listen to them, we can figure something out.
[01:12:44.642 --> 01:12:46.444]  There's probably a way to make that work.
[01:12:47.907 --> 01:12:51.388]  You look at Kim Jong-un, I've never seen him actually look this happy.
[01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:54.669]  I mean, I would imagine he does want to reform.
[01:12:54.989 --> 01:13:00.610]  He probably doesn't want to continue being part of this evil dynasty that he was, this communist dynasty he was born into.
[01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:03.711]  And you see all this happening just like Trump planned it.
[01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:07.132]  I was told by State Department officials over a month ago how this would then unfold.
[01:13:07.472 --> 01:13:08.892]  And that's why this is moving so fast.
[01:13:08.932 --> 01:13:12.513]  It looks like Kim Jong-un is basically really ready to give up the nuclear weapons.
[01:13:13.869 --> 01:13:19.882]  Yeah, you know, I call this the difference between wanting and deciding.
[01:13:20.945 --> 01:13:23.470]  They probably wanted to denuclearize.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.343]  But now he's actually decided, so that's what you're seeing looks like the activity.
[01:13:29.383 --> 01:13:36.206]  Both sides have just said, wait a minute, I can't even remember why we were mad at each other, right?
[01:13:36.866 --> 01:13:40.468]  History is going to say, why did you have that problem in the first place?
[01:13:40.528 --> 01:13:48.232]  In fact, Kim Jong-un, I believe one of his quips when he was shaking hands with Moon was, you know, why did this take so long?
[01:13:48.452 --> 01:13:49.433]  You know, why did we wait?
[01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.974]  Uh, you know, something along those lines.
[01:13:52.034 --> 01:13:53.475]  And I think that's how history will see it.
[01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:22.655]  The way the media is trying to ignore this or sidestep it, some of them are having to admit that it's a big deal and a good deal and that this is really game-changing, but the way they're trying to sabotage it and the way they're not giving Trump credit when the new policies really did push this decision is just crazy.
[01:14:24.057 --> 01:14:31.239]  Yeah, you know, the whole who gets credit for what is going to be fascinating to watch.
[01:14:32.059 --> 01:14:41.721]  I was very encouraged by seeing President Trump tweet credit to President Xi of China without taking credit in the same tweet.
[01:14:42.161 --> 01:14:46.242]  Now, I always talk about the dog that didn't bark, you know, look for the thing that's not there.
[01:14:47.402 --> 01:14:51.663]  What was missing was President Trump taking credit
[01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:54.159]  He was actually giving it to China.
[01:14:54.519 --> 01:14:55.940]  Now, is that the right way to play it?
[01:14:56.461 --> 01:14:57.081]  Hell yes!
[01:14:57.661 --> 01:15:02.505]  I mean, you know, that is your highest level of good work.
[01:15:02.905 --> 01:15:04.666]  I mean, that's the leader you want.
[01:15:04.746 --> 01:15:07.348]  You want him to say, I'll take the credit when it's mine.
[01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:08.428]  Here's your credit.
[01:15:08.949 --> 01:15:09.789]  Everybody gets credit.
[01:15:09.829 --> 01:15:10.930]  Let's make this thing happen.
[01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:18.055]  So his relationship with, you know, Macron, with President Xi,
[01:15:19.195 --> 01:15:21.136]  Yeah, those things make a big difference.
[01:15:21.556 --> 01:15:24.358]  And he does that stuff well when it matters.
[01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:26.879]  And notice Trump called it an elevation.
[01:15:27.359 --> 01:15:30.981]  He doesn't like fake tension and rotting countries and all the rest of it.
[01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:32.641]  He wants to pragmatically build things up.
[01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:39.645]  And why, if South Korea is the most productive country in the world per capita, why would we sit there just for the military-industrial complex?
[01:15:40.686 --> 01:15:42.628]  And for China, for tension, let this keep going.
[01:15:42.888 --> 01:15:48.155]  We now know it was the Clintons and others shipping weapons in, giving them the nukes, giving them the missiles that wanted to keep this going.
[01:15:48.635 --> 01:15:53.081]  And now the globalists and their continued crises creation have a new sheriff in town.
[01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:54.282]  But we'll see how they'll strike back.
[01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:58.627]  More predictions with Scott Adams and we'll talk about Kanye West and what's next.
[01:15:58.687 --> 01:15:59.288]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:59.308 --> 01:15:59.669]  Stay with us.
[01:16:05.453 --> 01:16:07.975]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[01:16:08.055 --> 01:16:11.117]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[01:16:11.197 --> 01:16:13.459]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[01:16:14.079 --> 01:16:15.560]  What is the latest from the UK?
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:24.226]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:28.429]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[01:16:28.469 --> 01:16:31.371]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS!
[01:16:31.431 --> 01:16:32.772]  It would have been mad!
[01:16:33.372 --> 01:16:41.055]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[01:16:41.095 --> 01:16:43.516]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[01:16:44.076 --> 01:16:45.817]  Trust Middle England.
[01:16:46.237 --> 01:16:47.697]  Trust Middle America.
[01:16:47.717 --> 01:16:51.499]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[01:16:51.819 --> 01:16:55.700]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:57.161]  All I can tell her
[01:16:57.801 --> 01:16:58.522]  We're good to go.
[01:17:17.475 --> 01:17:22.837]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[01:17:23.258 --> 01:17:36.103]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[01:17:36.143 --> 01:17:38.304]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:39.545]  You're a leading expert on this.
[01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:41.485]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:42.686]  Why are they trying to flood?
[01:17:43.712 --> 01:17:44.912]  Because they hate Christianity.
[01:17:45.533 --> 01:17:56.516]  They deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[01:17:56.556 --> 01:17:57.397]  They deny that.
[01:17:57.817 --> 01:18:01.478]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[01:18:01.538 --> 01:18:02.718]  They want to get rid of it.
[01:18:03.219 --> 01:18:05.679]  They want to replace it with the globalist project.
[01:18:05.939 --> 01:18:11.161]  And the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:13.222]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[01:18:13.974 --> 01:18:19.175]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[01:18:19.215 --> 01:18:25.237]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[01:18:25.537 --> 01:18:33.699]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[01:18:33.719 --> 01:18:39.581]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:40.801]  And look, what's really happening here?
[01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:43.122]  You know, don't underestimate
[01:18:43.722 --> 01:18:46.686]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[01:18:47.006 --> 01:18:48.087]  The victory of Brexit.
[01:18:48.367 --> 01:18:49.288]  The victory of Trump.
[01:18:49.909 --> 01:18:50.750]  You know, we're winning.
[01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:52.152]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[01:18:52.412 --> 01:19:00.020]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:00.921]  And you know something?
[01:19:01.462 --> 01:19:02.263]  If we can resist,
[01:19:03.058 --> 01:19:12.163]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[01:19:12.203 --> 01:19:13.944]  So don't get down, everybody.
[01:19:14.224 --> 01:19:15.084]  Don't get depressed.
[01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:17.926]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[01:19:18.772 --> 01:19:27.662]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[01:19:27.923 --> 01:19:28.603]  You're amazing.
[01:19:28.824 --> 01:19:29.504]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:32.308]  I know you're very busy, but that's as the EU has said.
[01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.851]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:38.255]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:52.142]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:58.005]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must protect it.
[01:19:58.485 --> 01:19:59.886]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[01:20:05.809 --> 01:20:08.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.929 --> 01:20:33.214]  Well, Scott Adams is our guest.
[01:20:33.274 --> 01:20:38.877]  And again, over the weekend and throughout the week, Kanye West started tweeting out some of his videos and information.
[01:20:39.317 --> 01:20:40.798]  And I'm all about positive thinking.
[01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:47.434]  Now I've run into some people, some of these preachers that get into it, they just say, name it and claim it.
[01:20:47.454 --> 01:20:52.236]  You just say, I want a box of gold to fall out of the sky, like a genie does, and it's going to happen.
[01:20:52.536 --> 01:20:54.857]  And then it doesn't happen, and I've seen the people go crazy.
[01:20:56.597 --> 01:21:00.659]  But I remember growing up, going into stores or businesses, and everybody liked my dad so much.
[01:21:00.679 --> 01:21:03.860]  And I was like a 10 or 11, 12, you know, kind of a bad attitude.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.360]  And I'd say, why does everybody like you?
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.301]  And he'd say, because I have a good attitude.
[01:21:08.174 --> 01:21:10.738]  And you know, my dad was married, my mom's still married, great.
[01:21:10.858 --> 01:21:15.925]  I was like, why do these women come up and like get out of cars at red lights and ask where you're going, what are you doing?
[01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.547]  He goes, I just have a good attitude.
[01:21:17.567 --> 01:21:18.208]  I have a good attitude.
[01:21:18.849 --> 01:21:20.551]  So I understand.
[01:21:21.638 --> 01:21:24.859]  In business and life and everything, being positive, looking at the best parts of it.
[01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:31.401]  I see some positive thinking where they get so positive, they look at all the bad things and don't do anything about it, just saying be positive.
[01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:37.063]  No, I think admitting bad things are going on is positive to get that out front and do something about it.
[01:21:37.103 --> 01:21:46.646]  I wanted to get Scott Adams of blog.Dilbert.com's breakdown on that, what he thinks is coming next with Trump, what's coming next with Kanye West.
[01:21:47.506 --> 01:21:47.746]  Well, I think
[01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:35.116]  No, it's right, that it's totally true, and I feel like I've missed the center point of it until just the last few weeks, but I think, like the hundreds of monkeys, Scott Adams, other people are starting to really get that it's not just positive thinkers like you that are so successful and right, and helping people like Kanye and others not be negative, but that we're now realizing, wait, the other side knows this, but is using the opposite tactics, and so it's more important than ever to do what you're doing.
[01:22:36.716 --> 01:22:40.639]  Yeah, there's such a utility in positivity.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:48.946]  The can-do, get-out-of-your-box, we-can-make-this-happen, make-America-great-again attitude.
[01:22:50.985 --> 01:22:52.906]  The thing is, it's sort of a long game.
[01:22:53.747 --> 01:23:02.513]  The classic game was, well, I'll take care of this special interest group, these guys will get a little something, these will get a little something.
[01:23:03.213 --> 01:23:11.099]  Trump, by completely refusing to recognize categories of Americans, rather than just treating us as Americans,
[01:23:11.799 --> 01:23:16.903]  It's a long game where you knew he would be viciously criticized for being racist, whatever.
[01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:22.347]  But if his plan works long term, the economy gets better.
[01:23:22.848 --> 01:23:27.051]  We see talk from Jared Kushner about prison reform.
[01:23:27.171 --> 01:23:28.612]  We might see something out of that.
[01:23:29.133 --> 01:23:30.954]  We see something good with North Korea.
[01:23:31.455 --> 01:23:36.799]  I think something good with Iran will happen after maybe some extra tenseness before we get there.
[01:23:37.359 --> 01:23:40.220]  But there's a whole lot of stuff going in the right direction.
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:42.001]  And that's why I call it the Golden Age.
[01:23:42.561 --> 01:23:53.244]  I think it's going to be a time when this president consistently draws a picture that says, this is what your experience is as our friend.
[01:23:53.804 --> 01:23:56.705]  This is what your experience is as not our friend.
[01:23:57.225 --> 01:23:59.266]  Do you see how gigantic this difference is?
[01:23:59.866 --> 01:24:00.907]  We'd like more friends.
[01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:01.947]  Come on over.
[01:24:02.507 --> 01:24:09.090]  You know, in some cases there will be legitimate differences of strategic priorities.
[01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:12.591]  So we can't be friends with everybody about everything.
[01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:18.113]  But I would argue that most of the problems, at least between countries, at least the big countries,
[01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:23.797]  Fall into the psychological positioning, persuasion kind of category.
[01:24:24.357 --> 01:24:32.022]  And I don't see anything that would physically stop us from having something good come out with Russia, with Iran.
[01:24:32.042 --> 01:24:38.707]  You know, the Palestinians is a little, not a little, but a harder, harder thing to crack.
[01:24:39.327 --> 01:24:44.171]  But for the big countries, I think we may be entering a golden age of cooperation.
[01:24:45.726 --> 01:25:05.098]  I agree with you and a lot of insiders, a lot of top academics, a lot of top people in government say though that the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of and other groups, they want tension, they want crisis, they want problems because they're crisis managers and that they're deliberately always trying to stoke tensions and problems.
[01:25:05.538 --> 01:25:06.519]  And you can see that
[01:25:07.529 --> 01:25:13.516]  Out of the groups trying to make sure we don't have peace with North Korea particularly and other things happening.
[01:25:13.536 --> 01:25:17.221]  They are actively in there trying to get us into a new conflict with Russia.
[01:25:17.781 --> 01:25:19.043]  What's your view on that, Scott Adams?
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:32.650]  Well, money ruins everything, you know, so if you have a enormous, you know, military industrial complex, there's just a lot of money to nudge a lot of things the way that will make them more money.
[01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:48.742]  So I don't know exactly how the conversations go, you know, within, you know, closed doors within, you know, Congress and Washington, you know, do they really say, ah, we don't want a war with North Korea, but it looks like it'd be profitable for your company and you, you donate to me, so I'll be okay.
[01:25:49.222 --> 01:25:51.084]  I don't know that it's express.
[01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:59.894]  It feels like it just manifests itself in a lot of different ways, in small ways, until it becomes a big problem.
[01:26:00.475 --> 01:26:08.324]  But if our economy is good and we've got a president who can say no to these companies, we've got something.
[01:26:09.825 --> 01:26:11.846]  President Trump has found a workaround.
[01:26:12.407 --> 01:26:15.569]  Because if you want to sell a lot of arms, there are two ways to do it.
[01:26:16.069 --> 01:26:17.090]  One is have a war.
[01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:18.491]  Nobody wants that.
[01:26:19.071 --> 01:26:22.313]  But the other way is to have a peaceful build-up of your military.
[01:26:22.793 --> 01:26:31.819]  And President Trump is saying, look, we're going to get to peace by sort of the Reagan method of making our military so strong that it's not even worth a thought.
[01:26:31.839 --> 01:26:32.259]  Peace or strength?
[01:26:32.279 --> 01:26:33.520]  Are you going to go up against him?
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.861]  Yeah.
[01:26:35.461 --> 01:26:43.045]  So the military-industrial complex has a plan B with President Trump that they did not have with, let's say, President Obama.
[01:26:43.105 --> 01:26:50.810]  And when you said that, I was just thinking, as a smaller microcosm, you're at the 40,000-foot view and about 1,000-foot view on the peninsula.
[01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:54.011]  To pressure the North to stop what they're doing in China.
[01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:55.051]  Massive build-up.
[01:26:55.871 --> 01:26:57.212]  Japan buys a bunch of weapons.
[01:26:57.552 --> 01:26:58.972]  South Korea buys a bunch of weapons.
[01:26:58.992 --> 01:26:59.673]  Peace through strength.
[01:27:00.513 --> 01:27:02.234]  They cut off Kim, have the sanctions.
[01:27:02.474 --> 01:27:03.254]  He comes to the table.
[01:27:03.514 --> 01:27:04.894]  So now we have the cake and eat it too.
[01:27:04.914 --> 01:27:05.275]  The U.S.
[01:27:05.295 --> 01:27:06.295]  is in a stronger position.
[01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:10.256]  These countries can defend themselves from China, which is becoming a bigger threat in the region.
[01:27:10.596 --> 01:27:14.858]  And we force North Korea to come to the table and begin de-escalating things.
[01:27:14.898 --> 01:27:16.638]  That is beautifully done.
[01:27:16.658 --> 01:27:18.439]  That is amazing parlance.
[01:27:19.383 --> 01:27:33.791]  But, and all of that is amazing and great, and you left out the best part of the story, which is North Korea is going to have an economic boom, the like of which they have never seen, you know, if they play well.
[01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:43.457]  So, if our former enemies see the benefit of becoming current friends, that's big.
[01:27:43.537 --> 01:27:44.657]  That's really big.
[01:27:44.678 --> 01:27:45.238]  Just like Vietnam.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.107]  Yeah, Vietnam, I think we, didn't we drag our feet a little bit on that?
[01:27:51.488 --> 01:27:55.274]  That was more of a running away situation than making peace.
[01:27:55.314 --> 01:27:57.958]  No, no, I agree, but I mean, now look 40 years later.
[01:27:57.978 --> 01:27:59.641]  I mean, just look at the place.
[01:27:59.721 --> 01:28:01.404]  I mean, they're our ally, they're against China, you know.
[01:28:02.836 --> 01:28:03.016]  Right.
[01:28:03.296 --> 01:28:10.600]  Yeah, and Japan, of course, is the best example of all time of the benefit of turning from enemy to friend.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.542]  That worked out very well for them, so that serves as a good model as well.
[01:28:13.582 --> 01:28:14.122]  There you go.
[01:28:14.242 --> 01:28:16.903]  Every time I have a great example, Scott's got one even better.
[01:28:16.943 --> 01:28:17.584]  Man, I tell you.
[01:28:18.244 --> 01:28:20.945]  I've been reading your books since I was a teenager.
[01:28:21.526 --> 01:28:23.667]  My uncle, God rest his soul, died a few years ago.
[01:28:23.687 --> 01:28:26.708]  He was a huge fan because he was a lay cartoonist.
[01:28:26.728 --> 01:28:28.309]  He liked doing drawings and stuff himself.
[01:28:28.689 --> 01:28:29.109]  Just amazing.
[01:28:29.129 --> 01:28:33.251]  When we come back, Scott Adams, I want to ask him in the final segment with us, what does he want to cover?
[01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:34.411]  What does he think is coming next?
[01:28:35.112 --> 01:28:36.592]  And, you know, a lot of positive things are happening.
[01:28:36.612 --> 01:28:39.354]  I agree, but what are the pitfalls of the golden age?
[01:28:39.394 --> 01:28:41.955]  Because so many times right before you get there,
[01:28:43.697 --> 01:28:46.218]  Before you get to the promised land, there's something in your way.
[01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:47.638]  We're not promising some utopia.
[01:28:47.658 --> 01:28:49.699]  We're just saying an age of things being better.
[01:28:50.279 --> 01:28:52.120]  Or will it be a technocracy of dystopia?
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.500]  It's a lot of powerful groups.
[01:28:54.761 --> 01:28:55.921]  They don't want to ride success.
[01:28:55.961 --> 01:28:58.222]  They want to sit on top of a pile of political skulls.
[01:28:58.562 --> 01:28:59.623]  They'll be back with Scott Adams.
[01:28:59.683 --> 01:29:00.263]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:02.554 --> 01:29:05.217]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[01:29:05.617 --> 01:29:10.763]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[01:29:11.443 --> 01:29:14.366]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:18.330]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:30.217]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[01:29:30.837 --> 01:29:41.603]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[01:29:41.903 --> 01:29:47.326]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:48.127]  Take a look!
[01:29:48.547 --> 01:29:50.931]  At our t-shirts, our books.
[01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:52.894]  It's a 360 win.
[01:29:53.275 --> 01:29:58.583]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle, you're helping the fight for freedom.
[01:29:58.863 --> 01:30:00.226]  So please go to the site now.
[01:30:00.666 --> 01:30:02.249]  We need your support.
[01:30:03.934 --> 01:30:04.875]  Hi, I'm Millie Weaver.
[01:30:05.815 --> 01:30:24.347]  I'm a reporter for InfoWars and the reason I brought this microphone up here to show you guys is there have been so many times that I've been accosted, spit at, had urine thrown on me by rogue people, especially Antifa groups, radical communist leftist groups.
[01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:31.828]  Because of the lies and propaganda that the mainstream media spews about InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:30:32.108 --> 01:30:34.489]  So I get attacked because of these lies.
[01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:35.509]  Physically attacked.
[01:30:35.929 --> 01:30:43.291]  Now, a lot of this lawsuit that's been put against Alex Jones and InfoWars surrounds Charlottesville.
[01:30:43.691 --> 01:30:45.331]  I was there in Charlottesville.
[01:30:45.771 --> 01:30:50.232]  I was the InfoWars reporter on the ground reporting to you guys what happened.
[01:30:50.632 --> 01:31:07.340]  We all know that the mainstream media afterward decided to spin a biased, one-sided storyline that you had a bunch of rogue KKK extremists come and attack a bunch of peaceful protesters out there.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:16.725]  What I can tell you is that because I had the ability to livestream and to broadcast on social media, which those broadcasts went viral,
[01:31:17.265 --> 01:31:21.927]  I was able to show what exactly actually happened out there in Charlottesville.
[01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:35.871]  There was violence on both sides, but I will say the overwhelming majority of the violence was coming from the Antifa leftist anti-protesters, the ones protesting people
[01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:39.473]  Who were out there trying to stand up for protecting a statue.
[01:31:39.773 --> 01:31:42.635]  And yes, there were rogue elements on both sides.
[01:31:42.975 --> 01:31:53.362]  But one side came with pepper spray, tear gas canisters, ice chests full of water balloons with chemicals and urine and feces in them to throw.
[01:31:53.702 --> 01:31:57.445]  And that was depicted and caught through my ability.
[01:31:57.765 --> 01:32:04.671]  To live stream broadcasts on Facebook, on YouTube, on these social media sites that they want to remove us from.
[01:32:04.872 --> 01:32:07.134]  I got the truth out there with Charlotte's film.
[01:32:07.874 --> 01:32:15.141]  While at the same time, myself and my cameraman especially were pepper sprayed in the face for being InfoWars.
[01:32:15.541 --> 01:32:21.067]  I made it clear to both Antifa and some of the radical elements on the
[01:32:21.767 --> 01:32:26.249]  Alternative right side that we did not agree with any of their positions.
[01:32:26.489 --> 01:32:30.251]  But what I told them was, I do agree with your right to free speech.
[01:32:30.751 --> 01:32:34.633]  Both of you guys have a right to be out here and peacefully protest.
[01:32:34.993 --> 01:32:42.596]  That didn't stop us from being pepper sprayed and attacked because of the lies and the propaganda that the mainstream media spreads about us and InfoWars.
[01:32:42.956 --> 01:32:48.499]  That's why it's so important that we protect free press, guerrilla journalists,
[01:32:49.179 --> 01:33:01.370]  All of us out here today who are in this room should understand and know the importance of our ability to go out there and tell the truth when sometimes the moral integrity of mainstream media is lapsed.
[01:33:06.755 --> 01:33:09.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:28.222]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.184 --> 01:33:34.365]  Well, Scott Adams has been on fire for a long time.
[01:33:34.405 --> 01:33:36.446]  How many number one New York Times bestsellers he's had?
[01:33:36.466 --> 01:33:37.326]  I know quite a few.
[01:33:37.426 --> 01:33:38.107]  Always on the list.
[01:33:38.727 --> 01:33:40.147]  Creator of Dilbert and so much more.
[01:33:40.227 --> 01:33:47.891]  But better known, I've got to say just to a wider audience today, by daring to not say that Trump was Satan,
[01:33:49.352 --> 01:33:50.532]  And then he went through a lot.
[01:33:50.813 --> 01:33:52.053]  You know, he talks about it.
[01:33:52.073 --> 01:33:58.815]  I've heard him talk about how it basically, you know, killed some of his speaking career and, you know, some of the things that he went through.
[01:33:59.136 --> 01:34:02.557]  But now, by being a trailblazer, it's paying off big time.
[01:34:02.617 --> 01:34:05.918]  And going back to that, what made you decide?
[01:34:05.938 --> 01:34:10.100]  Tell me you've always said what you think and stand for what you stand for.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.901]  Or maybe you've always been this outspoken, but it just seems like
[01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:16.442]  They're really attacking you more.
[01:34:16.482 --> 01:34:18.623]  Are you more outspoken than you used to be a decade ago?
[01:34:18.823 --> 01:34:21.564]  Or are they just bigger bullies than they were a decade ago?
[01:34:21.584 --> 01:34:22.525]  I mean, we know that's the case.
[01:34:22.945 --> 01:34:26.086]  Why is it now that they're just everywhere freaking out?
[01:34:26.126 --> 01:34:31.428]  How dare Scott Adams, you know, say these horrible things when it's totally positive?
[01:34:32.328 --> 01:34:35.149]  It just shows what crazy cults they are.
[01:34:36.863 --> 01:34:37.844]  Yeah, some of it is.
[01:34:37.864 --> 01:34:45.188]  I think people are thinking that I have enough influence that it's a problem to whatever they want to influence.
[01:34:45.648 --> 01:34:49.650]  So some of it is just the appearance of having influence that makes you a target.
[01:34:50.150 --> 01:35:03.978]  Now, I am a little more outspoken, but I got there, you know, honestly, by just, you know, getting on the early story about Trump's rise and being a narrator for that and predictor of it.
[01:35:04.558 --> 01:35:17.591]  So that gave me a little bit of credibility, which allowed me to change focus to a persuasion filter on politics, and people take me a little bit more seriously now.
[01:35:17.951 --> 01:35:28.662]  And then Kanye's tweet probably changed how people look at me as well, because in a sense it's showing that we're on the same wavelength on something that people care about.
[01:35:30.503 --> 01:35:32.164]  Well, you've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[01:35:32.204 --> 01:35:35.507]  What are you predicting next, or what trends is Scott Adams looking at?
[01:35:37.029 --> 01:35:39.711]  Well, it's a Friday, so I'm going to go all with the good news.
[01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:42.173]  That's where the golden age is taking us.
[01:35:42.713 --> 01:35:53.923]  On the humorous side of predictions, I had speculated that wouldn't it be funny if the climate, the temperature of the world went down during Trump's administration?
[01:35:54.283 --> 01:35:54.964]  For no reason.
[01:35:55.384 --> 01:35:57.186]  Just, you know, sometimes temperatures go down.
[01:35:57.806 --> 01:36:07.589]  And we're seeing some reports, I don't know how reliable they are, that there might be some kind of a cooling pause that we're in, which is hilarious, but not scientific.
[01:36:07.609 --> 01:36:14.291]  Well that's right, even NOAA came out, the big national center this week and said, oh global warming's not as bad as we thought, there's a cooling trend.
[01:36:15.749 --> 01:36:18.990]  Yeah, so I think here's my optimistic prediction.
[01:36:19.851 --> 01:36:24.733]  I think that the temperature might keep going up on average, even though it looks like it took a pause.
[01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:30.055]  But we're also developing technology that can alter the CO2 in the air.
[01:36:30.115 --> 01:36:31.075]  You can suck it out.
[01:36:31.515 --> 01:36:36.537]  And if we spend enough money, we can actually, you know, make a difference in the climate.
[01:36:37.037 --> 01:36:43.940]  So I think between the fact that the projection models are being proven to be a little hot and the fact that our technology is
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:57.184]  Coming online, the risk went from this big to maybe more like this, meaning that if you get the technology up, which we could do, it would just take a, you know, a moonshot kind of attitude to do it.
[01:36:57.204 --> 01:37:00.646]  But it's all, you know, the engineering is already proved out.
[01:37:01.186 --> 01:37:06.748]  So I think we're at a point where, uh, you know, climate change could approach solvable.
[01:37:07.728 --> 01:37:09.729]  Uh, you know, that's the optimistic view.
[01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:12.550]  Um, then on health care,
[01:37:13.523 --> 01:37:16.745]  I'd like to see technology do what government can't.
[01:37:16.885 --> 01:37:24.808]  Congress is a terrible tool for figuring out anything that's complicated and has a lot of different interests involved, and healthcare is all of that.
[01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:27.801]  But technology is coming online.
[01:37:27.861 --> 01:37:30.422]  We just saw a, which country was it?
[01:37:30.862 --> 01:37:36.943]  One of the Middle East countries developed a pod that you just get in it and it does a full body scan and checks everything.
[01:37:37.363 --> 01:37:38.183]  Just takes a minute.
[01:37:38.843 --> 01:37:43.744]  You're seeing lots of telemedicine, lots of breakthroughs in cancer treatments, etc.
[01:37:44.264 --> 01:37:52.106]  So the real magic bullet for healthcare is bringing down the cost through technology so that some people, perhaps not all,
[01:37:52.686 --> 01:38:02.554]  But some people who would not be able to afford health care could get something closer to a free version that might actually be the best health care you can get because it could be all the new stuff.
[01:38:03.054 --> 01:38:05.736]  Whereas other people might want to say, well, I want to keep my doctor.
[01:38:05.776 --> 01:38:06.837]  I like the personal touch.
[01:38:07.357 --> 01:38:09.779]  So I'm going to I'm going to just stay with the traditional path.
[01:38:10.199 --> 01:38:13.782]  I think we have a chance for a Bernie Sanders like
[01:38:14.651 --> 01:38:17.573]  Almost universal health care without changing taxes.
[01:38:18.113 --> 01:38:19.714]  Now, that would be the golden age, right?
[01:38:20.214 --> 01:38:24.336]  If you get there... Sure, because we lower the prices so much, it's still free market, but it's so... Exactly.
[01:38:24.696 --> 01:38:30.319]  Normally, in fact, in every case, technology gets more available, the price goes down massively.
[01:38:30.359 --> 01:38:32.020]  I mean, here's an example of a product we sell.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.301]  Alexa Breeze came out about three years ago.
[01:38:35.221 --> 01:38:37.102]  Back then, four-stage HIPAA filters were about $800.
[01:38:37.262 --> 01:38:41.024]  They were revolutionizing it, making it, you know, for a lot less.
[01:38:41.044 --> 01:38:41.625]  We were selling it for $300.
[01:38:42.705 --> 01:38:48.733]  Just in the three years it's gone down, we can sell it for $200 and it's only costing like $100 to make.
[01:38:49.594 --> 01:38:51.978]  It's about to go down to like $70 to make.
[01:38:51.998 --> 01:38:53.119]  We're going to lower the price again.
[01:38:53.459 --> 01:38:58.666]  But why is healthcare skyrocketing then when every other technological development makes the price go down?
[01:38:58.907 --> 01:39:00.329]  Is that because of bureaucracy or why?
[01:39:02.009 --> 01:39:08.372]  It's probably because of some combination of lobbyists and rules that are favorable for companies.
[01:39:08.473 --> 01:39:15.156]  There could be something about risk management that needs to be tweaked, maybe with better information, not to be reckless.
[01:39:15.596 --> 01:39:22.300]  But there are probably things that are safe enough or could be safe enough under the right conditions that we could do right now.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.681]  So some of it's probably regulation.
[01:39:24.861 --> 01:39:29.504]  Some of it is, you know, inertia and what we have to work with.
[01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:39.375]  And a lot of it is the new stuff that's expensive is, you know, for things that we have never been able to cure before.
[01:39:39.936 --> 01:39:41.437]  So some of it is all just good news.
[01:39:41.457 --> 01:39:43.600]  Yeah, you gotta pay for the big research up front.
[01:39:44.918 --> 01:39:52.822]  Yeah, and if there's a new solution for something that didn't have a solution before, that's an extra expense, even if you're happy about it.
[01:39:54.683 --> 01:40:00.986]  But anyway, the big picture is that for routine medical care, I think we could get that cost down through technology.
[01:40:01.841 --> 01:40:11.573]  Approaching zero for people who don't have many resources, and it would be maybe 95% as good as the full service that the rich people are getting.
[01:40:12.093 --> 01:40:13.355]  So I think that's possible.
[01:40:13.375 --> 01:40:15.277]  You're talking about almost a medical singularity.
[01:40:15.317 --> 01:40:18.882]  And before we get to more amazing predictions, let me just ask you this point.
[01:40:19.582 --> 01:40:20.383]  What would you call
[01:40:21.434 --> 01:40:25.636]  The thing that comes after the Golden Age, where things aren't perfect, but things get more and more positive.
[01:40:25.656 --> 01:40:29.758]  We go through some tumult, we go through some serious issues in that transition.
[01:40:29.818 --> 01:40:32.879]  Things are going that way, but we have that Atlantean moment.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.800]  We're in that process.
[01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:40.223]  The technology is so advanced, so dangerous, we blow ourselves up.
[01:40:42.304 --> 01:40:51.049]  Yeah, I'm a believer with Elon Musk and a lot of other smart people that the so-called singularity is a risk to humanity.
[01:40:51.590 --> 01:41:05.298]  And for those who are not familiar with that use of the term singularity, because it gets used in different contexts, it's when artificial intelligence gets to the point where the computers can reprogram themselves.
[01:41:05.718 --> 01:41:08.940]  In other words, where they can evolve on their own without our help.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:21.148]  And the thought is that when they reach that point, they will become a supermind, essentially, so quickly that we may not be ready for how much it changes society.
[01:41:22.128 --> 01:41:23.349]  I'm an optimist on that.
[01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:27.032]  I love the fact we're worrying about it, because that's what makes you safe.
[01:41:27.252 --> 01:41:31.415]  I call this the Adam's Law of slow-moving disasters.
[01:41:31.635 --> 01:41:36.158]  And the way that works is, if you can see a disaster coming for years,
[01:41:37.072 --> 01:41:38.213]  It almost never kills us.
[01:41:38.373 --> 01:41:39.574]  We didn't run out of oil.
[01:41:40.174 --> 01:41:44.337]  You know, the year 2000 thing didn't... Sure, humans do that.
[01:41:44.657 --> 01:41:46.798]  Humans build and try to take control of their environment.
[01:41:46.818 --> 01:41:48.139]  You're right, we're seeing that.
[01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.180]  So let me ask you this then.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:51.661]  What would you call what comes after the Golden Age?
[01:41:51.721 --> 01:41:52.942]  I'd call it the Age of Infinity.
[01:41:53.282 --> 01:42:02.428]  Life extension, being a Type 1 civilization, off-world, unlimited, humanity going in different directions, basically unlimited choices, a human singularity.
[01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:11.964]  Yeah, and it may be that intelligence that we now think is pockets, like you've got a brain, I've got a brain, the computer has a brain.
[01:42:12.768 --> 01:42:18.009]  Those things may be so merged in the future that intelligence doesn't mean what it used to.
[01:42:18.089 --> 01:42:19.410]  It's just what we all have.
[01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:22.430]  For example, you know, my phone is here.
[01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:29.292]  I can talk into my phone and get an answer to pretty much any question in the world, you know, and that's only going to get better.
[01:42:29.812 --> 01:42:34.373]  So when I'm on Periscope, for example, and I'm getting live responses in the comments,
[01:42:35.053 --> 01:42:41.557]  It feels like a big connected brain, because I can say stuff like, well, you know, in history that was that time.
[01:42:41.777 --> 01:42:42.877]  Oh, tell me the history.
[01:42:42.958 --> 01:42:44.018]  Hold on, Scott.
[01:42:44.038 --> 01:42:44.598]  Stay right there.
[01:42:44.638 --> 01:42:47.360]  I mean, you'd agree to the whole hour, but I don't want to take all your time.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:52.883]  But if we can go to break, come back for just a few minutes on the side to finish this thought and then other predictions about where Kanye's going next.
[01:42:52.903 --> 01:42:54.444]  And we'll let you go to have a great weekend.
[01:42:54.464 --> 01:42:55.965]  A little bit more time with Scott Adams.
[01:42:56.045 --> 01:42:56.705]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:56.925 --> 01:42:58.526]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[01:42:58.966 --> 01:43:01.388]  Follow Scott at Twitter at Scott Adams Says.
[01:43:06.738 --> 01:43:18.586]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[01:43:19.246 --> 01:43:28.572]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[01:43:28.773 --> 01:43:33.596]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[01:43:34.096 --> 01:43:43.405]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[01:43:44.246 --> 01:43:48.970]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:50.532]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[01:43:51.132 --> 01:43:57.438]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[01:43:57.478 --> 01:43:58.259]  Here's my problem.
[01:43:58.759 --> 01:44:07.206]  When I do take the bodies and the extruate things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[01:44:07.546 --> 01:44:08.747]  Now most people aren't... I had the same issue.
[01:44:09.007 --> 01:44:09.167]  Yeah.
[01:44:09.587 --> 01:44:13.750]  Neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[01:44:14.091 --> 01:44:19.335]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[01:44:19.515 --> 01:44:23.057]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 per cuminin level.
[01:44:23.338 --> 01:44:27.301]  We went out to the top labs and said we want the strongest concentrate.
[01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:39.109]  Of it out there, and Mike, you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products, you were saying that you really like bodies and do think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric, it's just incredible.
[01:44:39.209 --> 01:44:48.136]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[01:44:48.336 --> 01:44:53.938]  Now, your product is an extract, and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[01:44:54.158 --> 01:44:58.640]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[01:44:59.221 --> 01:45:02.422]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[01:45:02.782 --> 01:45:08.204]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[01:45:08.244 --> 01:45:09.905]  Well, that's another reason.
[01:45:09.945 --> 01:45:12.026]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that.
[01:45:12.066 --> 01:45:16.928]  They said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[01:45:17.088 --> 01:45:17.488]  Exactly.
[01:45:17.628 --> 01:45:24.491]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:29.313]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[01:45:36.053 --> 01:45:40.036]  Please continue to support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:40.537 --> 01:45:43.620]  We have Alpha Power back in stock!
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:47.623]  The fan favorite is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:47.703 --> 01:45:55.169]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:59.993]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[01:46:00.093 --> 01:46:00.714]  As you age,
[01:46:01.014 --> 01:46:01.494]  We all do.
[01:46:01.715 --> 01:46:05.837]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[01:46:05.857 --> 01:46:07.298]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[01:46:07.498 --> 01:46:11.421]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[01:46:11.441 --> 01:46:19.106]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:28.915]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[01:46:29.096 --> 01:46:37.240]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.561]  It is Alpha Power.
[01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.542]  It is back in stock.
[01:46:39.582 --> 01:46:46.486]  It is one of the biggest, best, most favorite products on InformalStore.com and it's back in stock right now at 25% off.
[01:46:46.546 --> 01:46:48.507]  Go and read the five-star review.
[01:46:48.507 --> 01:46:50.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:19.093 --> 01:47:36.037]  Don't know much about history Don't know much biology Don't know much about a science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I love you
[01:47:39.935 --> 01:47:46.503]  Scott Adams is a best-selling author, cartoonist, you name it, and very, very popular, I guess, futurist online.
[01:47:47.024 --> 01:47:53.592]  He joins us here and he's been at the center of the big Kanye West, I don't want to say awakening, but getting Kanye to go even more public and speak out.
[01:47:54.389 --> 01:48:08.779]  And so you were finishing up about the hive mind and how you're connecting in, and same thing, I'll be on Periscope, and I'll say something that isn't exactly right, just as I forgot, they'll get it right, or then they'll add some information, and the same thing on YouTube with live comments coming in.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:12.941]  It gets where you can't even really do it live yourself.
[01:48:12.981 --> 01:48:23.926]  You're just suddenly interfacing with the people and they're humans going out searching on the big giant hive mind coming back to that little node and then all sharing information with each other.
[01:48:24.406 --> 01:48:25.287]  That's what we started doing.
[01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:34.613]  20 years ago, I would start showing articles on the internet for radio and people are like, wow, he's not just talking on a webcam, he's showing me things.
[01:48:34.973 --> 01:48:40.195]  And it made people add a whole new level until it turned into radio for TV or vice versa.
[01:48:40.235 --> 01:48:44.596]  So finish up with that point and then tell us about your popular apps.
[01:48:44.676 --> 01:48:47.317]  And then I want to get into your next prediction for Kanye.
[01:48:47.717 --> 01:48:50.318]  Will they be able to break his spirit, break his will?
[01:48:51.978 --> 01:48:56.502]  Yeah, you know, the power of knowledge can't be underestimated.
[01:48:56.542 --> 01:49:09.574]  I think that it had a lot to do with why North Korea is getting flexible, because they can't keep the internet from their population and still be a legitimate modern country in the world in 20 years.
[01:49:09.654 --> 01:49:10.495]  It just can't happen.
[01:49:10.535 --> 01:49:11.796]  There is no path.
[01:49:12.435 --> 01:49:14.696]  For keeping the Internet away from a country.
[01:49:15.237 --> 01:49:27.444]  Likewise, Iran has the same problem, only maybe bigger, because they're trying to keep, at least they're trying to edit the Internet for their population of this gigantic young population.
[01:49:27.524 --> 01:49:29.825]  They're very disproportionately young.
[01:49:30.505 --> 01:49:31.666]  And they're kind of Western.
[01:49:32.206 --> 01:49:41.532]  So you've got these fairly Western, not so religious, relatively speaking, population bomb in Iran, who only needs the Internet
[01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:45.666]  To make some change, because young people plus Internet equals change.
[01:49:46.266 --> 01:49:55.656]  So the leaders of Iran have to see that they only have a runway of 5 to 10 years maximum for what they're doing now.
[01:49:56.096 --> 01:50:03.124]  So they better get flexible and figure out what the thing is after this that works better with the community of worlds.
[01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:10.818]  When we talk about how our audiences are getting younger and younger and mainstream media is getting older and older, I'm not knocking old people.
[01:50:10.878 --> 01:50:15.985]  It was old people who taught me about globalism and these systems of government and, you know, how to resist them.
[01:50:16.325 --> 01:50:19.889]  We're not attacking old folks when Paul Watson says, my audience is, you know, 18 to 30.
[01:50:21.664 --> 01:50:24.365]  On average, and CNN is basically 54 to 86.
[01:50:24.465 --> 01:50:25.946]  I mean, that's their number.
[01:50:26.306 --> 01:50:27.307]  Same thing with Fox News.
[01:50:28.187 --> 01:50:38.653]  But the fact is, I've looked up your demographics, interestingly enough, just through some Facebook statistics I saw, and you've got a wide swath of old, middle-aged, young, but you're trending younger.
[01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:44.536]  And I'm really seeing with not millennials so much, on average, there's a lot of great millennials, but with Generation Z.
[01:50:45.596 --> 01:50:48.878]  When my children are in school, they go play sports at other schools.
[01:50:49.258 --> 01:50:51.679]  They have friends that are in public schools.
[01:50:51.939 --> 01:50:52.680]  They're in private school.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:56.842]  And I'm like a rock star, but I'm kind of like tier two rock star.
[01:50:57.322 --> 01:50:58.023]  Oh, it's Alex Jones!
[01:50:58.063 --> 01:50:58.663]  Hey, photo!
[01:50:58.963 --> 01:51:07.027]  Paul Watson, Gavin McGinnish, Steven Crowder, all these people are like, do you know them?
[01:51:07.067 --> 01:51:07.708]  Do you know them?
[01:51:07.748 --> 01:51:09.469]  They don't know who Wolf Blitzer is.
[01:51:09.509 --> 01:51:11.590]  They don't care who Tom Brokaw is.
[01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:13.671]  I mean, that's got to scare the establishment.
[01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:28.060]  Yeah, you know, I'm not sure how much the big networks are making an impact anymore, because it feels like ABC, NBC, CBS, they're not moving the dial at all.
[01:51:28.821 --> 01:51:32.084]  There's an interesting thing with Fox News and CNN.
[01:51:32.584 --> 01:51:40.491]  They've kind of set themselves as each other's nemesis, which gives them both more attention, is great for branding and all that.
[01:51:40.531 --> 01:51:44.134]  So CNN will keep its relevance.
[01:51:45.036 --> 01:51:49.409]  But the ABC, NBC, CBS folks, they seem to be timing out.
[01:51:51.084 --> 01:51:52.745]  So what comes next for Kanye?
[01:51:52.965 --> 01:51:53.606]  Have you had a chance?
[01:51:53.626 --> 01:51:54.726]  I know he's been tweeting your stuff.
[01:51:54.746 --> 01:51:56.327]  It's not like I'm enamored with a star.
[01:51:56.768 --> 01:52:01.931]  I'm enamored by a top-tier, you know, second or third, first, largest music person in the world.
[01:52:02.811 --> 01:52:03.992]  Probably a billion fans.
[01:52:04.552 --> 01:52:11.697]  And to have him make this bold move and Jordan Peterson to be a rock star, I mean it really shows that I think we've hit the tipping point.
[01:52:11.717 --> 01:52:14.579]  As you said during the break, in your own words, something's happening.
[01:52:14.919 --> 01:52:16.800]  So can you speak to that and what is happening?
[01:52:18.982 --> 01:52:28.045]  There seems to be some kind of shift in, you know, I hate to go new age, but, you know, because it would be easy to go into woo-woo land.
[01:52:28.405 --> 01:52:31.986]  But it feels like the way people are looking at things is changing.
[01:52:32.106 --> 01:52:33.607]  Now, Trump is a big part of that.
[01:52:33.627 --> 01:52:35.007]  North Korea is a big part.
[01:52:35.127 --> 01:52:36.148]  Kanye is a part.
[01:52:36.828 --> 01:52:46.451]  And I think that people are noticing that when we think in non-traditional ways and get out of the box and say, OK, we thought this was impossible.
[01:52:46.951 --> 01:52:48.452]  Let's just think, what if it isn't?
[01:52:49.278 --> 01:52:52.545]  So maybe the whole thing is just simply defined by possibility.
[01:52:53.186 --> 01:52:55.591]  And I think that our notion of what is possible.
[01:52:56.591 --> 01:52:56.871]  Got it.
[01:52:57.011 --> 01:52:58.152]  Got expanded recently.
[01:52:58.652 --> 01:53:00.952]  North Korea and Kanye being the best examples of it.
[01:53:01.393 --> 01:53:02.633]  But I think there's more to come.
[01:53:02.653 --> 01:53:07.694]  It just, you know, I'm not going to get scientific about this because I can't offer you data.
[01:53:08.175 --> 01:53:18.898]  But now that the physical problems have been solved, you know, we can get enough physical resources to where we need it if we can figure out, you know, where to put it and how to get it there.
[01:53:20.199 --> 01:53:25.747]  So, we're in a world where there's great possibility and we're being held back by the way we think of things.
[01:53:26.268 --> 01:53:30.855]  And we're watching that the way we think of things is being changed by thought leaders.
[01:53:31.676 --> 01:53:34.680]  Well, in closing, I was just talking to one of the producers earlier.
[01:53:35.581 --> 01:53:48.606]  And he watched the whole hearings with diamond and silk, and the Republican congressman, particularly the Democrats too, didn't even really know what the internet was, didn't understand social media, were just bumbling around.
[01:53:48.726 --> 01:53:59.691]  I watched some of it too, and that's what's scary is, that's how the censorship can come in with the tech giants, because Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you know, they're being interviewed by congressmen that think
[01:54:01.175 --> 01:54:01.476]  I don't
[01:54:12.955 --> 01:54:25.121]  From up in Alaska who said the internet's a bunch of tubes and you see that unfortunately people that don't know how any of this works are sitting there trying to then dictate how it's going to operate.
[01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:35.446]  I think that's one of the big pitfalls is you're going to have so many people that are technologically and informationally illiterate that they just try to censor all of us and they don't even know what they're doing.
[01:54:36.795 --> 01:54:41.863]  Now extend that to anything complicated like health care, you know, fixing education.
[01:54:42.964 --> 01:54:49.154]  You know, if the people working on this are all 80 and tired and, you know, and busy,
[01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:54.071]  Congress, I've said this before, they're not the right tool for the job.
[01:54:54.511 --> 01:54:59.692]  And of course, in the past, they have to rely on lobbyists to do the technical stuff for them.
[01:55:00.132 --> 01:55:09.594]  But I think in the future, the Internet is going to sort out what it thinks is a good idea, and Congress is going to be just the implementers and law writers in the long run.
[01:55:10.374 --> 01:55:15.875]  I think the Internet will become the government, in a good way, not a bad way.
[01:55:16.055 --> 01:55:19.858]  Well, Scott Adams, who just joined us, opened the interview by saying, people told me don't come on your show.
[01:55:20.378 --> 01:55:22.800]  And then they make up what I've said and what I've done to try to stop him.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.502]  But as he said, he'll go on anybody's show and he's not listening to that.
[01:55:25.542 --> 01:55:26.843]  He knows most of it's bull.
[01:55:26.863 --> 01:55:28.465]  The point is, they then do that to him.
[01:55:28.525 --> 01:55:29.585]  They do that to Kanye.
[01:55:29.606 --> 01:55:31.207]  They're telling Kanye, you're not going to have your...
[01:55:31.567 --> 01:55:33.549]  You know, your job anymore, we're going to punish you.
[01:55:33.569 --> 01:55:35.971]  And he's saying, listen, I'm free, you're authoritarian, it's over.
[01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:39.434]  And I think we're breaking their will right now to break our will.
[01:55:39.754 --> 01:55:41.235]  I think we've crossed the tipping point.
[01:55:41.495 --> 01:55:46.680]  And I think you're going to see an acceleration thanks to Trump and all of our listeners and Scott Adams and Kanye and everybody else.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.863]  We're going to see an acceleration now in the tipping point.
[01:55:51.124 --> 01:55:54.567]  And I think you're going to see the First Amendment and free speech worldwide come back in a big way.
[01:55:54.587 --> 01:55:56.188]  I don't think you can stop the signal.
[01:55:56.208 --> 01:55:57.029]  What do you think in closing?
[01:55:58.726 --> 01:56:06.110]  I'll tell you, when I was first asked to come on the show today by your producer, my first thought was, I'm too busy, too much going on.
[01:56:06.170 --> 01:56:07.711]  I'd love to, but I don't have time.
[01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:12.353]  And then I saw people telling me in the news, hey, you can't go on InfoWars.
[01:56:12.413 --> 01:56:14.214]  And I said, well, I'm going to clear my schedule now.
[01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:17.055]  Because Kanye says I can talk to anybody I want.
[01:56:18.516 --> 01:56:20.517]  So it's changing things.
[01:56:21.478 --> 01:56:23.199]  It's a bigger deal than people think.
[01:56:23.319 --> 01:56:23.779]  So thanks.
[01:56:24.338 --> 01:56:25.899]  Well, Scott, I thank you.
[01:56:25.919 --> 01:56:28.001]  Yeah, when people tell me not to cover things, it makes me cover more.
[01:56:28.041 --> 01:56:29.201]  Well, again, thank you for your work.
[01:56:29.221 --> 01:56:31.843]  We'll be watching and we'll be reading, and hopefully you'll join us again soon.
[01:56:31.863 --> 01:56:32.664]  Thank you and have a great weekend.
[01:56:33.831 --> 01:56:34.651]  All right, thanks for having me.
[01:56:35.051 --> 01:56:36.712]  That was a powerful full hour.
[01:56:37.052 --> 01:56:38.712]  Just really glad he gave us that time.
[01:56:38.832 --> 01:56:39.472]  Smart guy, man.
[01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:42.913]  I always liked him, but I tell you, I really love him now, because it's just not the Kanye thing.
[01:56:42.953 --> 01:56:46.254]  It's like, well, the stuff he's saying is now, I'm getting it.
[01:56:46.374 --> 01:56:48.414]  And I'm realizing, why didn't I get the Dennis Rodman thing?
[01:56:49.015 --> 01:56:53.916]  Why didn't I get that that was just like, would we have sent a basketball star to the Soviet Union in 1980?
[01:56:55.276 --> 01:56:56.957]  Would I call him a traitor for going over there?
[01:56:57.017 --> 01:56:57.217]  No!
[01:56:57.257 --> 01:56:58.337]  They're going over there to talk to him.
[01:56:58.797 --> 01:57:02.958]  It's just the hideousness of the communists and watching it and Dennis being happy with them.
[01:57:03.158 --> 01:57:04.199]  That's what I couldn't stand.
[01:57:05.919 --> 01:57:06.559]  But I get it now.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.200]  So again, I'm learning that I have my blind spots too.
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:10.741]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:11.281 --> 01:57:12.061]  You live, you learn.
[01:57:12.081 --> 01:57:13.882]  Alright, I have not plugged but one time today.
[01:57:13.922 --> 01:57:15.982]  If I don't start plugging every segment, we're not going to be able to expand.
[01:57:16.402 --> 01:57:17.803]  If I stop plugging, we're going to go under.

[01:58:01.648 --> 01:58:05.291]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:05.591 --> 01:58:09.134]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:58:09.454 --> 01:58:12.577]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[01:58:12.817 --> 01:58:22.164]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[01:58:22.304 --> 01:58:24.645]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:58:24.865 --> 01:58:26.566]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:29.407]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[01:58:29.667 --> 01:58:34.189]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[01:58:34.529 --> 01:58:40.571]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:45.555]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:58:46.035 --> 01:58:47.176]  That helps with focus, too.
[01:58:47.616 --> 01:58:48.597]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[01:58:49.097 --> 01:58:53.220]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:58:53.641 --> 01:58:57.684]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:58:57.944 --> 01:58:59.485]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:00.386]  For the better.
[01:59:00.826 --> 01:59:04.589]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[01:59:05.009 --> 01:59:06.731]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:59:07.091 --> 01:59:07.972]  I hope this lasts.
[01:59:08.812 --> 01:59:10.874]  One Eye Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:59:11.154 --> 01:59:17.278]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:59:17.578 --> 01:59:22.502]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:59:22.982 --> 01:59:26.305]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:59:26.885 --> 01:59:31.909]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:59:32.469 --> 01:59:34.270]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:35.090]  Not anymore.
[01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:36.651]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[01:59:37.212 --> 01:59:39.053]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:59:39.293 --> 01:59:40.653]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:59:41.454 --> 01:59:44.796]  Head to infowarsstore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[01:59:45.496 --> 01:59:47.697]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:54.681 --> 02:00:00.584]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.072 --> 02:00:18.814]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:00:19.135 --> 02:00:23.477]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.739 --> 02:00:26.899]  Man!
[02:00:36.477 --> 02:00:39.520]  I get so caught up in the news in front of me that I never even plug who's coming up.
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:43.843]  Like, one of the hottest guests you can get right now, always a great guest, is Scott Adams.
[02:00:43.863 --> 02:00:44.884]  Didn't even plug he was coming on.
[02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:48.006]  It's because I got tunnel vision on news.
[02:00:48.046 --> 02:00:49.428]  This North Korea thing is so big.
[02:00:50.108 --> 02:00:53.151]  And then, PJW's coming on!
[02:00:53.191 --> 02:00:54.312]  Good old PJW.
[02:00:54.732 --> 02:00:56.553]  You know he doesn't like being on air, even though he's good at it.
[02:00:58.215 --> 02:00:59.876]  And he's a smart whippersnapper.
[02:01:00.477 --> 02:01:01.618]  He's almost like 35 now.
[02:01:01.638 --> 02:01:03.079]  We're all getting old around here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:06.783 --> 02:01:08.004]  Look, there's Paul right there!
[02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:16.247]  How's Bridgette Steele doing, my boy?
[02:01:16.287 --> 02:01:18.388]  Should I bully you with some Bridgette accents?
[02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:22.650]  The bullying and harassment start after 20 seconds.
[02:01:23.791 --> 02:01:25.131]  Well, I mean, we're learning from the news.
[02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:26.212]  There's gay grooming.
[02:01:27.694 --> 02:01:30.676]  But even worse, Paul, there's British accent torture.
[02:01:30.696 --> 02:01:33.679]  Like, they play Skinny Puppy to torture people at Gitmo.
[02:01:33.959 --> 02:01:42.866]  But you know, on our little private channel, it's Royal Britain Steel Royal Royal... I'm getting flashbacks already, Alex.
[02:01:42.946 --> 02:01:43.666]  PTSD.
[02:01:43.726 --> 02:01:44.427]  I mean, come on.
[02:01:45.107 --> 02:01:48.230]  How have I survived for 16 years with this level of abuse?
[02:01:49.271 --> 02:01:51.452]  I do talk to you in the Jack T. Ripper voice, though.
[02:01:51.492 --> 02:01:53.174]  I go, get over here with that belt.
[02:01:53.514 --> 02:01:54.615]  Feed me this machine gun.
[02:01:55.135 --> 02:01:56.196]  Hurr on, Mandrake.
[02:01:56.236 --> 02:01:57.277]  The redcoats are coming.
[02:01:58.621 --> 02:01:59.101]  That's right.
[02:01:59.121 --> 02:02:02.143]  I mean, traumatized doesn't even begin to cover it, Alex.
[02:02:02.183 --> 02:02:03.644]  It's just, how have I survived?
[02:02:04.324 --> 02:02:05.025]  God only knows.
[02:02:05.045 --> 02:02:06.486]  We've got a lot of serious news to cover.
[02:02:06.506 --> 02:02:08.527]  Some of the top stories that I want to review.
[02:02:08.887 --> 02:02:09.767]  But let's get into it right now.
[02:02:10.608 --> 02:02:12.229]  We've got a lot of news coming in the next segment.
[02:02:12.249 --> 02:02:14.110]  There's been a lot of articles, investigative journals.
[02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:18.512]  Let's talk about how I control everything you say and do.
[02:02:19.733 --> 02:02:20.734]  I mean, just tell people.
[02:02:20.774 --> 02:02:21.674]  Tell them about our relationship.
[02:02:21.694 --> 02:02:22.435]  I mean, let's get serious.
[02:02:22.715 --> 02:02:23.655]  How do things actually work?
[02:02:23.695 --> 02:02:24.716]  The media's obsessed with it.
[02:02:25.336 --> 02:02:26.017]  Explain it to people.
[02:02:27.833 --> 02:02:34.240]  Well, I mean, if you read this Daily Beast article, which we can get into, by the way, point by point, it's complete trash.
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.422]  Again, they introduced these articles.
[02:02:36.442 --> 02:02:38.364]  This is why I don't do mainstream media, Alex.
[02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:44.410]  Every single time they approach you and say, oh, we just want to write a fair profile piece.
[02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:46.671]  In fact, I can quote from his email.
[02:02:46.971 --> 02:02:50.754]  This is the first email this Nico Heinz sent to me in relation to this piece.
[02:02:50.774 --> 02:02:54.776]  He said, it's so weird that no one has done a decent profile yet, given your stature.
[02:02:55.056 --> 02:03:00.620]  Would be great to get a pint with you to discuss what inspired you, what drives you to work so hard and what you plan to do next.
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:07.884]  And then he's like, I'd love to talk to some people you've worked with or known over the years to get a sense of how you shot up the ranks and become such an influential figure.
[02:03:08.304 --> 02:03:09.185]  So it goes from that
[02:03:09.785 --> 02:03:27.074]  To him writing the article, and the two main sources for the article are your bitter ex-wife, Alex, somebody who I met once 13 years ago, and a disgruntled former employee who barely even came into the Infowars office, again, probably exchanged like two sentences with him over the course of 10 years.
[02:03:27.594 --> 02:03:33.497]  And that's the impartial, independent sources that they've based this whole profile piece on.
[02:03:34.033 --> 02:03:36.958]  So again, it's the complete disconnect between the initial approach.
[02:03:37.398 --> 02:03:38.540]  Oh, we just want to be friendly.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:40.243]  We just want to understand where you're coming from.
[02:03:40.743 --> 02:03:48.676]  So the actual article, a vicious hit piece where they literally crown me like King of the Tards in the in the image there and say that I'm
[02:03:49.545 --> 02:03:51.266]  You know, your crackpot protege.
[02:03:51.706 --> 02:03:53.847]  So this is why I don't do mainstream media.
[02:03:53.867 --> 02:04:02.530]  I also don't do the Daily Beast because I directly told them, look, you basically doxxed out and exposed Pamela Geller's daughters who weren't political.
[02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:04.951]  They just had like a fashion account on Instagram.
[02:04:05.706 --> 02:04:12.390]  Opening them up to a fatwa from Islamic terrorists, I said, I'm not going to talk to a publication that treats people like that.
[02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:15.271]  They didn't put that in the article, Alex, did they?
[02:04:15.291 --> 02:04:21.174]  They didn't mention why I refused to talk to them, because that would expose the Daily Beast for what it is.
[02:04:21.835 --> 02:04:24.256]  And that was the foundation of the article.
[02:04:24.276 --> 02:04:26.898]  They approached me and said, this is going to be fair, this is going to be balanced.
[02:04:27.318 --> 02:04:30.780]  Turns out to be a vicious hit piece every single time.
[02:04:31.539 --> 02:04:35.440]  And it's like someone saying, come back behind the bleachers with me, you know, a hot girl.
[02:04:36.581 --> 02:04:42.642]  This actually happened to me once, in like, eighth grade, and then her boyfriend thought I was hitting on her, and him and his buddy were there to try to beat me up.
[02:04:43.123 --> 02:04:45.503]  So I get behind the bleachers after school, I'm like, okay, you wanna kiss?
[02:04:45.823 --> 02:04:47.844]  All of a sudden they're like, we're gonna kick your ass, Jones.
[02:04:47.864 --> 02:04:48.824]  Well, that isn't what happened.
[02:04:49.345 --> 02:04:50.565]  But the point is, is that
[02:04:52.363 --> 02:04:54.828]  It's like luring a kid, hey I got candy in the white van.
[02:04:55.290 --> 02:04:58.156]  And a little kid gets in the white van and little Paul Watson says, oh hi Daily Beast!
[02:04:58.216 --> 02:05:00.321]  And I'm like, we're tying you up little kid!
[02:05:00.341 --> 02:05:02.085]  I mean that's what this is, deception!
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:05.621]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:05:05.781 --> 02:05:08.184]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.

[02:05:53.417 --> 02:05:54.518]  That means it's clean.
[02:05:54.858 --> 02:05:55.859]  That means it's pure.
[02:05:55.979 --> 02:05:58.801]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[02:05:58.881 --> 02:06:01.644]  That's Infowarswives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:06:15.014 --> 02:06:15.875]  You found it.
[02:06:16.335 --> 02:06:17.936]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.839]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:28.087 --> 02:06:31.635]  Alright, we're now into the third hour on this Friday Global Transmission.
[02:06:31.696 --> 02:06:33.540]  Paul Joseph Watson is my guest.
[02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:36.026]  And we never talk about what goes on at InfoWars.
[02:06:36.046 --> 02:06:36.767]  We never talk about...
[02:06:38.052 --> 02:06:40.553]  How we come up with ideas, stories, any of this.
[02:06:41.113 --> 02:06:46.034]  So I thought, in amongst all the huge news I'm going to be getting to in a moment, why not get Paul Joseph Watson on?
[02:06:46.054 --> 02:06:52.836]  And you can even call him with your questions for Paul Joseph Watson on our personal workings of InfoWars.
[02:06:53.437 --> 02:06:54.777]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:06:54.797 --> 02:06:54.857]  877-789-2539.
[02:06:54.877 --> 02:06:56.838]  Paul and I used to talk three or four times a week.
[02:06:56.878 --> 02:06:57.438]  We probably talked
[02:07:05.807 --> 02:07:07.108]  Paul, how often do we talk now?
[02:07:07.548 --> 02:07:14.133]  Because I love this Daily Beast fabrication, because the Daily Beast isn't important enough on their own to talk about.
[02:07:14.973 --> 02:07:31.065]  They've had hundreds of these about me, and they've had dozens of them about you, and it's incredible how fictitious they are, how much work goes in, how they tell weird stories on purpose so people think they must be true.
[02:07:31.886 --> 02:07:35.228]  Like, I'm wearing swastika shoes in the office?
[02:07:36.788 --> 02:07:40.750]  And again, telepathically gay groomed people?
[02:07:41.351 --> 02:07:42.951]  I mean, this is in the Daily Mail.
[02:07:43.271 --> 02:07:48.074]  He never said anything sexual to the man, but he felt like he was being gay groomed.
[02:07:48.154 --> 02:07:53.256]  I mean, you read this stuff and it's like, why do they come up with such ridiculous garbage?
[02:07:53.276 --> 02:07:56.578]  And then you pointed out, with his latest piece, how they twist everything.
[02:07:56.618 --> 02:07:56.958]  It's like,
[02:07:58.443 --> 02:07:59.992]  Why aren't they just fiction writers?
[02:08:00.032 --> 02:08:02.024]  Why aren't they writing screenplays for Hollywood, Paul?
[02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:08.324]  Well, I mean, it's because that would be a more honest profession than the most dishonest people going.
[02:08:08.724 --> 02:08:10.165]  And they're trying to frame you.
[02:08:10.185 --> 02:08:15.547]  They're trying to create a perception of you that they can broadcast to the world, which is completely inaccurate.
[02:08:16.007 --> 02:08:21.290]  And basically, this article, you know, I was going to do a video response to it, but it's just not that interesting.
[02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.691]  It's not worthy enough to make a video about.
[02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:25.111]  It's too long.
[02:08:25.172 --> 02:08:27.272]  It's, you know, TLDR, too long, didn't read.
[02:08:27.613 --> 02:08:28.253]  It's boring.
[02:08:28.713 --> 02:08:34.475]  Because it's full of, like, weird stuff I said when I was 19 and 20, which I don't even believe anymore.
[02:08:34.955 --> 02:08:39.977]  And their main sources... I mean, let's go for a few quotes, because it's funny as hell.
[02:08:40.617 --> 02:08:40.837]  It says,
[02:08:48.154 --> 02:08:49.936]  Who are those insiders, Alex?
[02:08:50.436 --> 02:08:53.358]  Your bitter ex-wife and a disgruntled former employee.
[02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:55.020]  They're not insiders.
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:58.402]  They're literally the very opposite of insiders.
[02:08:58.422 --> 02:08:59.643]  They're now outsiders.
[02:08:59.663 --> 02:09:03.346]  And not just outsiders, but outsiders with their own agenda.
[02:09:03.866 --> 02:09:06.248]  So even in that very first sentence there,
[02:09:07.159 --> 02:09:11.543]  They're saying, oh, we've got, we've got, you know, inside intel from the people who would be in a position to know.
[02:09:12.043 --> 02:09:15.626]  I literally met these people twice, like five years ago.
[02:09:15.646 --> 02:09:19.410]  It also says that you are a smartass at my house smoking cigarettes.
[02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:27.216]  You've only joked around in a few video shots with cigarettes, and every once in a while, because I know I've talked about it with you, I mean, I might have seen you smoke twice.
[02:09:27.336 --> 02:09:28.738]  I mean, you weren't smoking then.
[02:09:29.986 --> 02:09:30.306]  I wasn't.
[02:09:30.546 --> 02:09:32.487]  That was 2005 when I met her.
[02:09:32.527 --> 02:09:33.487]  I wasn't smoking.
[02:09:33.867 --> 02:09:38.268]  I was as nice and kind as possible, but because now she's got an agenda.
[02:09:38.568 --> 02:09:44.730]  And by the way, they'd literally use this entire hit piece against me because they didn't really have that much on me as a platform for her website.
[02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:46.510]  So that was another part of it.
[02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:48.531]  The other sources they've got are
[02:09:49.231 --> 02:09:49.832]  Alex Jones.
[02:10:09.449 --> 02:10:10.830]  I don't even know who it is.
[02:10:11.090 --> 02:10:13.532]  I don't even remember this person's name.
[02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:17.696]  These are the two guys who knew him intimately growing up.
[02:10:18.136 --> 02:10:20.538]  One of them I barely knew, and the other one I don't even remember.
[02:10:21.019 --> 02:10:25.323]  So he was basically going to this rural village where I used to live.
[02:10:25.848 --> 02:10:29.271]  Knocking on people's doors and trying to find out if they went to school with me.
[02:10:29.631 --> 02:10:32.874]  I mean, they must have thought... And then they say you didn't grow up in a council house.
[02:10:33.374 --> 02:10:38.659]  But I remember, I'm going to get into your personal stuff, but your parents had to sell everything because the steel factory closed.
[02:10:39.039 --> 02:10:45.164]  And I remember you complaining about, when you were 18 and worked for me, about burning cars outside basically the Section 8 housing.
[02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:49.025]  And then they just say, that's all a lie, that you grew up in this beautiful meadow.
[02:10:49.346 --> 02:10:50.726]  What does it even matter?
[02:10:50.746 --> 02:10:52.747]  You never made it a big deal that you grew up in a poor area.
[02:10:52.967 --> 02:10:54.768]  You just said that's what you were doing when people asked.
[02:10:55.308 --> 02:10:57.689]  And they try to make how weird deceivers.
[02:10:57.709 --> 02:11:00.450]  No, we didn't lie about WNDs in Iraq.
[02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:05.492]  We didn't lie about the Alexa systems of Amazon listening to you.
[02:11:06.213 --> 02:11:07.713]  We didn't lie about world government.
[02:11:07.733 --> 02:11:08.333]  We told the truth.
[02:11:08.353 --> 02:11:09.654]  We didn't lie about Trump was going to win.
[02:11:09.894 --> 02:11:10.454]  We were right.
[02:11:10.774 --> 02:11:11.755]  We're the trailblazers.
[02:11:12.435 --> 02:11:14.257]  We're the people telling you the truth over and over again.
[02:11:14.297 --> 02:11:15.178]  We have the credibility.
[02:11:15.198 --> 02:11:22.085]  We told you about the secret deal with North Korea, how they were going to denuclearize and have these meetings and sign a peace treaty and merge together.
[02:11:22.345 --> 02:11:23.186]  It's all being announced.
[02:11:23.486 --> 02:11:24.627]  We are real.
[02:11:24.987 --> 02:11:26.529]  And the good guys know we're real.
[02:11:26.729 --> 02:11:31.594]  Then they say, oh, you're not the counterculture because the Republicans have all three branches.
[02:11:31.834 --> 02:11:34.336]  Barely half of those are establishment.
[02:11:35.057 --> 02:11:42.384]  We're fighting hard, and we have a sane group in the government that doesn't want to go under full Hollywood, globalist, Chinese, communist control.
[02:11:42.424 --> 02:11:51.312]  But all of the media, all the academia, all the big megabanks, all the Fortune 100 are globalist, openly trying to destroy this country in free speech, Paul.
[02:11:51.612 --> 02:11:52.954]  We are the resistance, not them!
[02:11:54.352 --> 02:11:55.533]  Well that's exactly it Alex.
[02:11:55.553 --> 02:11:59.336]  They want to take away our authenticity because it's all about authenticity.
[02:11:59.356 --> 02:12:09.345]  I mean that's why Kanye's exploded because he's at least expressing some kind of authenticity away from the reservation of leftist dogmatic mind control.
[02:12:09.385 --> 02:12:11.087]  That's why they're so petrified of it.
[02:12:11.487 --> 02:12:13.589]  So you bring it back to what you said at the start of that.
[02:12:14.235 --> 02:12:17.356]  They're trying to make out that I was like born into white privilege.
[02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:21.158]  Okay, my parents bought their first house from the council.
[02:12:21.238 --> 02:12:23.499]  It was a council house for £30,000.
[02:12:24.279 --> 02:12:26.400]  This was a tiny little three bedroom house.
[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:35.843]  My dad literally had to get up at 6am every single morning for 30 years to work in a factory making tools.
[02:12:36.324 --> 02:12:38.745]  Okay, this wasn't a privileged upbringing.
[02:12:38.785 --> 02:12:41.426]  I mean, it was a happy upbringing, but it was by no means privilege.
[02:12:41.806 --> 02:12:42.266]  My mom
[02:12:43.217 --> 02:12:46.304]  Literally went out on the streets in northern ghetto towns.
[02:12:47.213 --> 02:12:49.935]  Until midnight, talking to drug addicts.
[02:12:49.955 --> 02:12:52.036]  That was literally her job for years.
[02:12:52.116 --> 02:12:54.998]  She would come back at like 1am after having done this job.
[02:12:55.499 --> 02:12:57.980]  And they bought their second house for £58,000.
[02:12:59.201 --> 02:13:00.302]  I mean, that was a big step up.
[02:13:00.622 --> 02:13:06.506]  Basically, my parents worked their way up from the working class to the lower middle class, and that's how I grew up.
[02:13:06.586 --> 02:13:08.267]  It was, you know, a happy upbringing.
[02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:11.169]  Had lots of friends, lots of, you know, I was playing in the field.
[02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:12.890]  Sure, but they even try to steal your identity.
[02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:14.131]  You never made a big deal out of this.
[02:13:14.151 --> 02:13:15.732]  There's a couple of news articles, they ask how you grew up.
[02:13:16.052 --> 02:13:16.533]  You tell them.
[02:13:17.193 --> 02:13:20.235]  And I have to know you when you were 18, and so I know your parents.
[02:13:20.255 --> 02:13:21.036]  I mean, I've talked to them.
[02:13:21.096 --> 02:13:21.816]  I know your life.
[02:13:22.457 --> 02:13:27.841]  I know how they had to sell their houses and everything, because there were no jobs or whatever, and move to France, where it was totally depressed property values.
[02:13:27.861 --> 02:13:28.922]  I mean, I know the whole story.
[02:13:28.942 --> 02:13:29.702]  I know the truth, Paul.
[02:13:29.902 --> 02:13:32.884]  And I sit there, and I know the story of Sheffield, too, because I've read about it in the news.
[02:13:33.125 --> 02:13:34.225]  And they just sit there and lie.
[02:13:34.245 --> 02:13:36.147]  It just shows how they're nothing but frauds.
[02:13:37.588 --> 02:13:44.153]  Well, yeah, the reason my parents moved to France was because my dad's factory job got shipped off to the Czech Republic.
[02:13:44.513 --> 02:13:48.676]  So it was directly as a result of globalism that it changed their lifestyle.
[02:13:48.696 --> 02:13:54.240]  They sold the house, were able to buy a cheap house for what you could get in France with my auntie at the time.
[02:13:54.741 --> 02:13:58.423]  So that's the white, you know, privileged upbringing that I had.
[02:13:58.764 --> 02:14:02.927]  But yeah, it's just every little thing here is either twisted or completely untrue.
[02:14:03.547 --> 02:14:07.030]  And you go back to the Comedy Central hit piece, which you mentioned earlier as well.
[02:14:07.654 --> 02:14:23.764]  In that, they try to make out, because it's aimed at me basically at the start, they play a video of me, they try to make out that I have no interest in punk whatsoever and that I just adopted this kind of rebellious youth now as a gimmick to try and give myself authenticity.
[02:14:24.144 --> 02:14:27.146]  What's funny though is if you read this Daily Beast hit piece,
[02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:35.616]  The kids who went to school with me say, yeah, he was into punk, he was into the Sex Pistols, he was into smoking and rebelling and playing guitar.
[02:14:35.936 --> 02:14:44.084]  So actually one hit piece in the one thing they get right in the Daily Beast hit piece disproves the other hit piece by Comedy Central.
[02:14:44.444 --> 02:14:47.206]  And you know, I'm not claiming I was some great badass or whatever.
[02:14:47.606 --> 02:14:48.627]  But yeah, I went to school.
[02:14:48.667 --> 02:14:50.988]  I got kicked out of school briefly for smoking weed.
[02:14:51.468 --> 02:14:53.310]  I was into drinking.
[02:14:53.370 --> 02:14:54.350]  I was into smoking.
[02:14:54.410 --> 02:14:57.032]  All the usual things you go through as a young teenager.
[02:14:57.332 --> 02:15:00.454]  And I was into punk music and grunge and alternative music.
[02:15:00.734 --> 02:15:06.058]  And yes, that had an influence on my mindset growing up because I did get in trouble from time to time.
[02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:07.618]  Was a little bit rebellious.
[02:15:08.019 --> 02:15:11.481]  And you know, that continued throughout the political awakening that I had as well.
[02:15:12.259 --> 02:15:14.140]  So yes, I am authentic.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:14.981]  I'm not perfect.
[02:15:15.041 --> 02:15:16.982]  I wasn't a complete badass, but I'm authentic.
[02:15:17.443 --> 02:15:20.605]  And that had a direct impact relation to what I do now.
[02:15:21.343 --> 02:15:26.086]  So I used one, you know, one truth out of one hit piece to debunk the other.
[02:15:26.106 --> 02:15:28.767]  I believe the same thing when I talk about the crazy stuff I did growing up.
[02:15:28.827 --> 02:15:30.828]  They go, oh, Jones has all these crazy stories.
[02:15:31.269 --> 02:15:32.469]  Look what we've done since then.
[02:15:32.509 --> 02:15:33.230]  It's all crazy.
[02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:37.072]  I mean, it's these little state, and they always take that we have families, too.
[02:15:37.432 --> 02:15:38.493]  Like, they hate that we have families.
[02:15:38.513 --> 02:15:39.393]  They hate that we have wives.
[02:15:39.413 --> 02:15:41.114]  They hate that we have kids.
[02:15:41.474 --> 02:15:43.015]  They just can't stand the authenticity.
[02:15:43.035 --> 02:15:46.037]  Let's talk about now some of the other big lies against Infowars.
[02:15:46.057 --> 02:15:47.097]  We haven't scripted this talk.
[02:15:47.397 --> 02:15:49.839]  We talked like two minutes a few days ago, and I got pulled to come on.
[02:15:50.359 --> 02:15:55.323]  Let's talk about what it's been like with 16 years at InfoWars and where he thinks we're going in the future.
[02:15:55.624 --> 02:15:57.205]  Then your phone calls and a bunch of news.
[02:15:57.585 --> 02:15:59.106]  PJW joins InfoWars.
[02:15:59.126 --> 02:15:59.507]  Stay with us.
[02:16:03.348 --> 02:16:09.976]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[02:16:10.657 --> 02:16:12.459]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[02:16:13.059 --> 02:16:18.926]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[02:16:19.327 --> 02:16:21.970]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.252]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:16:25.612 --> 02:16:31.535]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:16:32.195 --> 02:16:38.659]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:16:39.019 --> 02:16:44.922]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:16:45.382 --> 02:16:49.003]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:16:49.484 --> 02:16:57.707]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine in the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[02:16:58.087 --> 02:17:04.330]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:17:05.373 --> 02:17:09.794]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[02:17:10.414 --> 02:17:18.535]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[02:17:19.075 --> 02:17:20.756]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[02:17:21.296 --> 02:17:28.217]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[02:17:28.277 --> 02:17:31.277]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[02:17:31.858 --> 02:17:32.758]  It's not absorbable.
[02:17:33.138 --> 02:17:33.698]  It's toxic.
[02:17:34.418 --> 02:17:40.784]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[02:17:41.005 --> 02:17:46.510]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[02:17:46.650 --> 02:17:49.172]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[02:17:49.893 --> 02:17:58.275]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[02:17:58.335 --> 02:18:02.436]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[02:18:02.856 --> 02:18:07.558]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[02:18:08.138 --> 02:18:11.699]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[02:18:11.999 --> 02:18:15.860]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:19.201]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[02:18:19.221 --> 02:18:20.362]  We have a good supply right now.
[02:18:20.782 --> 02:18:22.143]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[02:18:22.583 --> 02:18:24.864]  But this may be the clincher.
[02:18:24.904 --> 02:18:28.146]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:31.947]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[02:18:32.408 --> 02:18:34.529]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[02:18:34.889 --> 02:18:36.250]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[02:18:36.610 --> 02:18:43.973]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[02:18:44.273 --> 02:18:45.134]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:18:45.834 --> 02:18:45.914]  Yeah.
[02:19:00.731 --> 02:19:00.991]  I hope so.
[02:19:17.324 --> 02:19:18.505]  That we can work this out.
[02:19:36.642 --> 02:19:39.423]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[02:19:39.744 --> 02:19:48.087]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[02:19:48.628 --> 02:19:52.950]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:59.953]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:06.394 --> 02:20:15.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.322 --> 02:20:24.586]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.901 --> 02:20:29.522]  Alright, let me give the number out.
[02:20:29.602 --> 02:20:36.043]  Folks, if you've got any questions or comments for Paul or myself about InfoWars, 877-789-2539.
[02:20:36.063 --> 02:20:40.784]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[02:20:41.064 --> 02:20:42.084]  We never do stuff like this.
[02:20:42.104 --> 02:20:43.244]  People are always asking questions.
[02:20:43.644 --> 02:20:51.006]  But if we don't talk about ourselves a lot in our own workings, people then just kind of go out and see what the establishment says.
[02:20:51.506 --> 02:20:55.627]  It doesn't really do anything, but they're obsessed with stealing our identities.
[02:20:56.874 --> 02:21:12.578]  They have shows like Homeland, and shows like The Opposition, and countless others, where they obsess on us all day, they steal our identities, they misrepresent what we say, and then they hate us all at the very, very same time.
[02:21:13.718 --> 02:21:14.598]  Why is that the case?
[02:21:14.638 --> 02:21:15.838]  Because we're like Kanye West.
[02:21:15.878 --> 02:21:18.039]  Doesn't mean Kanye West is perfect, doesn't mean we are.
[02:21:18.099 --> 02:21:20.319]  We're trying to support free thinking and free speech.
[02:21:20.359 --> 02:21:21.560]  That's really paramount, isn't it?
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:22.900]  That's why it's the First Amendment.
[02:21:24.315 --> 02:21:25.636]  And worldwide, it comes first.
[02:21:26.137 --> 02:21:33.143]  The right to your views, the right to your mind, the right to having at least your own destiny in your head, between your ears.
[02:21:33.884 --> 02:21:36.146]  And the idea that you can associate with who you want.
[02:21:36.246 --> 02:21:37.067]  That's courage!
[02:21:37.767 --> 02:21:38.908]  Kanye West has got courage.
[02:21:38.948 --> 02:21:48.277]  Nobody else in the entertainment industry who's still on the front lines, who's still out there doing anything other than like James Woods, that incredibly talented guy.
[02:21:48.517 --> 02:21:49.658]  He's been blackballed.
[02:21:50.939 --> 02:21:52.460]  And I have them trying to destroy me all the time.
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.061]  People go, oh, isn't that terrible?
[02:21:55.101 --> 02:21:56.802]  Well, it's terrible that they're so bad.
[02:21:56.822 --> 02:21:58.842]  It proves how bad they are.
[02:21:58.862 --> 02:22:02.244]  I can't even bring myself to sue people that defame me.
[02:22:03.044 --> 02:22:04.945]  But people that sue me now, I'm counter-suing them.
[02:22:05.705 --> 02:22:09.607]  They're dropping the lawsuits left and right, but they just file more.
[02:22:09.887 --> 02:22:11.588]  But it's going to be okay.
[02:22:11.748 --> 02:22:13.329]  It's a badge of honor this is happening.
[02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:16.210]  But, Paul, specifically the workings of InfoWars.
[02:22:17.523 --> 02:22:20.586]  Talk about how we operate here for folks that don't know.
[02:22:20.606 --> 02:22:22.507]  I mean, people that are here know.
[02:22:23.028 --> 02:22:24.949]  I hire people I think are smart and cool that I trust.
[02:22:25.089 --> 02:22:25.570]  Turn them loose.
[02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:33.897]  Every once in a while I'll see something I don't like or more often than not, Paul, isn't it you that calls me and says, hey, you really, I think you're off the reservation.
[02:22:33.917 --> 02:22:35.098]  It only happens about once a year.
[02:22:35.138 --> 02:22:35.999]  You're always right.
[02:22:36.819 --> 02:22:41.944]  But they have it like, I've got you on this short leash and I sent you a memo when you didn't like Trump at first.
[02:22:42.244 --> 02:22:43.665]  And I said, you better get on the Trump train.
[02:22:43.965 --> 02:22:45.787]  Paul, have I ever talked to you like that?
[02:22:47.182 --> 02:22:48.443]  There was no memo, Alex.
[02:22:49.003 --> 02:22:49.524]  You sent one.
[02:22:49.584 --> 02:22:50.344]  I didn't receive it.
[02:22:50.905 --> 02:22:54.988]  But yes, I mean, the way it works is obviously you give people an opportunity.
[02:22:55.008 --> 02:22:56.168]  They need to prove themselves.
[02:22:56.609 --> 02:23:00.792]  Maybe you would keep them on a short leash initially, but there's no leash on me now.
[02:23:00.812 --> 02:23:10.899]  I mean, you let me do whatever the heck I want because you trust me because we've been doing it for so long and there's no there's no hard line narrative that you call up and bark down the phone every day.
[02:23:10.919 --> 02:23:11.799]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:13.961]  I mean, I had my reservations about Trump.
[02:23:14.759 --> 02:23:35.480]  I supported Rand Paul at the beginning, but obviously when I saw why Trump was becoming so popular, because he was the revolution against politically correct behaviour, politics that people despised in America, and I was on that whole, you know, that whole movement coming up before Trump even announced he was running for office, obviously then I supported Donald Trump.
[02:23:36.258 --> 02:23:37.478]  No regrets that I did.
[02:23:37.838 --> 02:23:41.059]  But no, there's no hardline narrative that comes down every day.
[02:23:41.539 --> 02:23:46.600]  And yeah, sometimes I have differences with what's posted on InfoWars and I tell you about it and we take it from there.
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:55.821]  But the idea that you like bullied and harassed me by doing British accents down the phone and that... I mean, these are the quotes in the article, go and read them.
[02:23:55.881 --> 02:23:58.522]  She's like, oh, he was tortured by this.
[02:23:59.082 --> 02:24:01.302]  Absolute, complete nonsense.
[02:24:01.362 --> 02:24:03.223]  The entire article is a tissue of lies.
[02:24:03.883 --> 02:24:04.643]  The other thing, Alex,
[02:24:05.712 --> 02:24:06.512]  John Ronson.
[02:24:06.852 --> 02:24:09.693]  I mean, this is a guy who's popped into your life from time to time.
[02:24:10.033 --> 02:24:12.054]  Again, it's the same thing with all these journalists.
[02:24:12.354 --> 02:24:14.755]  They're so nice behind the scenes.
[02:24:15.095 --> 02:24:16.175]  They're so friendly.
[02:24:16.655 --> 02:24:17.475]  And yet they talk to John Ronson.
[02:24:17.535 --> 02:24:21.176]  And then he told the newspaper, he said he likes me and he missed me and wanted to be my friend at the RNC.
[02:24:21.776 --> 02:24:26.638]  I'm still at the RNC, two days later, and he goes, Alex Jones is the most horrible person in the world.
[02:24:27.418 --> 02:24:28.379]  And all this other crap.
[02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:30.822]  And then I let him back in the office, since I've known him for 20 years.
[02:24:31.282 --> 02:24:33.264]  He was shaking in hatred.
[02:24:33.545 --> 02:24:34.686]  He couldn't even contain it.
[02:24:35.167 --> 02:24:37.950]  And then he's like my proctologist.
[02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:41.894]  He's telling everybody how I operate, what I do, who I am.
[02:24:41.914 --> 02:24:43.496]  It's ridiculous!
[02:24:44.462 --> 02:24:58.266]  Well, I mean, in this article, the quote is, he asks Ronson about me because I once told John Ronson that I saw his documentary about you, Secret Rulers of the World, and that's how I first learned about you, which was basically a hit piece, by the way.
[02:24:58.326 --> 02:25:04.448]  But I learned about you initially because of that documentary way back, even before 9-11, I think that was.
[02:25:04.968 --> 02:25:08.049]  So he said about me in this article, John Ronson.
[02:25:08.449 --> 02:25:09.649]  Well, I'm not happy about it.
[02:25:09.709 --> 02:25:11.270]  Talking about, you know, our influence.
[02:25:11.957 --> 02:25:15.485]  He fears Watson is obsessed with Muslims and dangerous.
[02:25:16.126 --> 02:25:21.819]  So I listen to Jon Ronson as well about you on different podcasts that he does and he's so vicious about you now.
[02:25:22.628 --> 02:25:29.216]  Funny thing is, Alex, John Ronson wanted to do a profile piece on me for the New York Times about six months ago.
[02:25:29.376 --> 02:25:29.697]  Me too.
[02:25:29.777 --> 02:25:32.240]  And he was the nicest person imaginable.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.542]  No, no, he did the same thing.
[02:25:33.862 --> 02:25:40.630]  And he said, he said, listen, he's one of the, he goes, just leave the Muslims alone and we're, and the media is going to just, it was like a message.
[02:25:40.651 --> 02:25:41.452]  He goes, stop it.
[02:25:42.073 --> 02:25:43.935]  And I said, my God, they're bringing in Sharia law.
[02:25:43.955 --> 02:25:44.776]  I have it in the news today.
[02:25:45.056 --> 02:25:46.258]  In Sweden, officially, the government.
[02:25:46.638 --> 02:25:47.699]  They're killing everybody.
[02:25:47.719 --> 02:25:50.482]  They're the most anti-feminine thing on earth.
[02:25:50.963 --> 02:25:52.805]  And he just goes, no, they're good people, Alex.
[02:25:52.865 --> 02:25:53.045]  No.
[02:25:53.345 --> 02:25:53.726]  Stop it.
[02:25:54.046 --> 02:25:54.426]  Stop it.
[02:25:54.787 --> 02:25:55.167]  Stop it.
[02:25:55.788 --> 02:25:58.371]  Since you brought it up, by the way, it wasn't a profile either of us.
[02:25:58.411 --> 02:25:59.171]  I found out later.
[02:25:59.832 --> 02:26:00.853]  It was just a big hit piece.
[02:26:01.093 --> 02:26:01.574]  Exactly.
[02:26:01.854 --> 02:26:02.835]  Total dishonesty.
[02:26:03.136 --> 02:26:03.977]  Total dishonesty.
[02:26:05.118 --> 02:26:11.702]  I mean I've got the DMs where he's like basically kissing my behind to try and get this profile piece, whereas in public he's completely vicious.
[02:26:12.162 --> 02:26:18.986]  I tagged him once in a tweet talking about this kind of stuff and he almost had a psychological breakdown so I can't even tag him in tweets anymore.
[02:26:19.367 --> 02:26:21.908]  But he's another person who talks out of both sides of his mouth.
[02:26:22.228 --> 02:26:23.009]  They all do it.
[02:26:23.629 --> 02:26:28.392]  There's another quote from the article from a disgruntled former employee, we all know who it is.
[02:26:29.016 --> 02:26:35.362]  Says I put him in the same camp with Richard Spencer and Pamela Geller and the anti-Islam faction of the so-called alt-right.
[02:26:35.662 --> 02:26:37.764]  Several years ago he was anti-war and libertarian.
[02:26:37.924 --> 02:26:38.725]  Yeah, I still am.
[02:26:39.806 --> 02:26:46.492]  Notice he mixes the alt-right that you distance yourself from day one with being against the radical Islam takeover.
[02:26:46.792 --> 02:26:49.495]  I mean, radical Islam is like being against the Nazis.
[02:26:50.636 --> 02:26:53.198]  But it says now he is a racist.
[02:26:53.318 --> 02:26:53.779]  Well, Alex,
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:58.689]  The alt-right hates me specifically because I'm not racist.
[02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:00.994]  But notice this person won't even say what their name is.
[02:27:01.274 --> 02:27:05.082]  They just proclaim you're a racist using liberal tactics.
[02:27:05.831 --> 02:27:14.213]  Yeah, I mean, you just showed a tweet up there, like Richard Spencer has events and there are more television cameras at his speeches than actual attendees.
[02:27:14.553 --> 02:27:15.853]  I've made videos about this.
[02:27:16.193 --> 02:27:21.595]  The alt-right would not exist anymore if not for mainstream media attention because they use them as a bogeyman.
[02:27:22.175 --> 02:27:23.115]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:27:23.435 --> 02:27:28.816]  All the people that organize Charlottesville, all the top people, a year or two before worked for Hillary Obama.
[02:27:29.116 --> 02:27:30.457]  It's central casting!
[02:27:31.397 --> 02:27:33.037]  And I'm allowed to say that, folks.
[02:27:33.058 --> 02:27:33.578]  That's a fact.
[02:27:34.098 --> 02:27:36.959]  The fact that leftist groups pose as Nazis, that's been in court.
[02:27:37.279 --> 02:27:37.919]  That's come out.
[02:27:38.039 --> 02:27:38.879]  It's a known fact.
[02:27:40.259 --> 02:27:42.200]  But whether they are or not, they all hate us.
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:45.121]  I mean, 4chan are not fans of Infowars.
[02:27:45.161 --> 02:27:46.301]  You can go on there and have a look.
[02:27:46.521 --> 02:27:47.662]  Richard Spencer hates us.
[02:27:48.022 --> 02:27:49.762]  We're constantly having battles with these people.
[02:27:49.782 --> 02:27:50.782]  Yeah, we have the establishment.
[02:27:51.122 --> 02:27:52.363]  We have the Nazis hating us.
[02:27:52.703 --> 02:27:53.123]  Exactly.
[02:27:53.243 --> 02:27:54.403]  Because it's all fake.
[02:27:54.763 --> 02:27:56.504]  We're real, they're fake, and they know it.
[02:27:57.236 --> 02:27:57.936]  And they know it.
[02:27:58.257 --> 02:28:03.239]  There's a very clear distinction between people like you, people like myself, people like Cernovich, and the alt-right.
[02:28:03.339 --> 02:28:04.840]  The alt-right does not like us.
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:06.941]  You have to be completely dishonest.
[02:28:06.961 --> 02:28:08.121]  That's a Hillary term.
[02:28:08.181 --> 02:28:09.562]  She just said that two years ago.
[02:28:09.582 --> 02:28:13.103]  I mean, oh God said it's alt-right, everything that's new, independent.
[02:28:13.143 --> 02:28:15.004]  No, we're the new right, as you pointed out.
[02:28:15.244 --> 02:28:16.185]  We're not the alt-right.
[02:28:17.509 --> 02:28:19.690]  Yeah, so yet again, another twist, another lie.
[02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:22.992]  There's another quote in there which says, Paul seems totally different to when I knew him.
[02:28:23.052 --> 02:28:24.973]  The same intelligence, but clouded somehow.
[02:28:25.294 --> 02:28:29.856]  This was a kid who I'd never heard of who knew me, supposedly, in school when I was 13.
[02:28:30.076 --> 02:28:32.038]  Oh, but I'm different now.
[02:28:32.318 --> 02:28:33.939]  Of course I'm different from when I was 13!
[02:28:34.199 --> 02:28:36.600]  I'm 35 years old!
[02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:38.121]  It was like two decades ago!
[02:28:38.601 --> 02:28:40.242]  So again, it's just so weak!
[02:28:40.683 --> 02:28:42.624]  It's so incredibly weak and so funny.
[02:28:42.984 --> 02:28:44.245]  But we can go on after the break.
[02:28:44.847 --> 02:28:45.849]  And then we'll go to phone calls.
[02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:54.441]  But I want to specifically get into this because... I mean... Okay, I'm gonna wait till we come back from break.
[02:28:54.481 --> 02:28:55.142]  InfoWars.com.
[02:28:55.162 --> 02:28:56.063]  They're trying to censor it.

[02:30:10.147 --> 02:30:10.688]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:11.088 --> 02:30:12.169]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:30:12.409 --> 02:30:12.989]  Hey, brother.
[02:30:13.290 --> 02:30:13.650]  Good, man.
[02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:14.470]  Thank you for calling.
[02:30:14.570 --> 02:30:15.111]  Hey, hey.
[02:30:15.211 --> 02:30:19.634]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:30:19.834 --> 02:30:25.978]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:30:26.058 --> 02:30:28.039]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[02:30:28.139 --> 02:30:33.763]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:30:35.444 --> 02:30:36.564]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:30:36.624 --> 02:30:40.626]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:30:41.006 --> 02:30:42.706]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:30:43.066 --> 02:30:43.807]  And exactly.
[02:30:43.827 --> 02:30:48.048]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:30:48.428 --> 02:30:48.708]  Boom!
[02:30:48.848 --> 02:30:51.669]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:30:51.729 --> 02:30:52.249]  It's amazing.
[02:30:52.329 --> 02:30:56.691]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:31:02.072 --> 02:31:02.912]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:31:02.932 --> 02:31:03.953]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:03.973 --> 02:31:04.273]  Go ahead.
[02:31:05.217 --> 02:31:07.099]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:31:07.139 --> 02:31:16.569]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:31:17.650 --> 02:31:21.014]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:31:21.394 --> 02:31:21.794]  Absolutely.
[02:31:43.945 --> 02:31:57.163]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:32:01.994 --> 02:32:05.579]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.182]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[02:32:07.202 --> 02:32:08.924]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[02:32:09.185 --> 02:32:11.588]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[02:32:11.628 --> 02:32:12.570]  We've beaten six.
[02:32:12.850 --> 02:32:14.813]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[02:32:15.514 --> 02:32:16.235]  You're my soldier.
[02:32:16.255 --> 02:32:16.996]  We're all in this together.
[02:32:18.035 --> 02:32:22.741]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[02:32:23.141 --> 02:32:24.142]  So I salute you and I thank you.

[02:33:34.278 --> 02:33:36.800]  We're going right back to PJW here in about 60 seconds.
[02:33:37.700 --> 02:33:38.841]  The crew's got to make me plug.
[02:33:38.901 --> 02:33:39.902]  Plus, I should be plugging.
[02:33:39.962 --> 02:33:48.027]  These are life-changing products, especially the X2, the pure iodine, that is still 25% off because we've got an emergency shipment in.
[02:33:48.047 --> 02:33:53.811]  I'm going to have to end that sale in a couple days because we're going to coast out until it sells out at full price, which is still a great deal.
[02:33:53.871 --> 02:33:56.473]  The good halogen, you owe it to yourself, your family.
[02:33:56.633 --> 02:33:57.374]  Look into it.
[02:33:58.666 --> 02:34:02.287]  Don't drink the stuff from the store, you know, for the surface cuts or whatever to leave a hole in your gut.
[02:34:02.587 --> 02:34:03.588]  This is totally different.
[02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.468]  Those are bound iodines.
[02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:07.409]  This is totally different.
[02:34:08.849 --> 02:34:09.350]  X2.

[02:34:25.611 --> 02:34:26.852]  We rarely do that.

[02:34:40.495 --> 02:34:44.538]  Read the thousands of five-star reviews at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:34:45.058 --> 02:34:49.261]  That's InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:49.702 --> 02:34:52.924]  And we also have Alpha Power.
[02:34:52.944 --> 02:34:55.466]  It's basically the same herbs and compounds.
[02:34:56.427 --> 02:34:59.529]  Organic, concentrated, but dry.
[02:34:59.549 --> 02:35:01.310]  So it's a much bigger dose.
[02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:02.511]  It's just not cold-pressed.
[02:35:03.212 --> 02:35:06.114]  And it's so strong, I can't take Alpha Power.
[02:35:07.725 --> 02:35:11.629]  Other people tag it, and I go, my God, this is... I mean, I'll just be... I'll tell the story briefly.
[02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:14.372]  I was 40, four years ago.
[02:35:15.032 --> 02:35:17.094]  I go in, get my blood tested, medical doctor.
[02:35:17.114 --> 02:35:18.415]  Everybody says, man, you gotta go get a checkup.
[02:35:18.435 --> 02:35:23.560]  So they do the whole, you know, test, blood test, you know, doctor had me, you know, everything, you know what they do.
[02:35:24.121 --> 02:35:24.722]  Not a lot of fun.
[02:35:24.762 --> 02:35:25.662]  First time a guy's done that.
[02:35:25.682 --> 02:35:27.544]  I guess once in football, they kind of did it.
[02:35:27.584 --> 02:35:28.926]  But the point is, is that
[02:35:30.046 --> 02:35:30.806]  First time a guy's done.
[02:35:31.287 --> 02:35:33.808]  Anyways, the point... I'm being bad, I'm gonna stop right now.
[02:35:34.129 --> 02:35:39.492]  The point is, is that he said, hey, you want a Viagra Cialis prescription?
[02:35:39.512 --> 02:35:39.872]  You're 40.
[02:35:40.633 --> 02:35:41.793]  I said, man, I don't need that.
[02:35:41.813 --> 02:35:43.694]  He said, well, you know, just try it.
[02:35:44.295 --> 02:35:51.679]  Well, the Viagra made me see blue, and I guess it worked, but not... It's like, your engine fires right up anyway.
[02:35:51.699 --> 02:35:53.260]  It's like, that can really tell the difference?
[02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:55.922]  Maybe 93 octane to, you know, 89 octane?
[02:35:56.462 --> 02:35:57.263]  Okay, a little bit of difference.
[02:36:00.259 --> 02:36:05.045]  See, Alex, like, kinda more through the day, just a little more excited.
[02:36:05.686 --> 02:36:06.927]  I mean, being honest, this stuff works.
[02:36:08.289 --> 02:36:17.701]  In my experience, everybody else's that I've talked to, stuff like super male, but especially alpha power and stuff, it's insane.
[02:36:19.662 --> 02:36:20.382]  It's insane.
[02:36:21.223 --> 02:36:24.545]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:24.845 --> 02:36:28.387]  Now I'm going to stop being bad and telling jokes.
[02:36:28.427 --> 02:36:29.147]  I apologize.
[02:36:29.827 --> 02:36:35.791]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, I was raised as Amish, and I am as pure as the driven snow.
[02:36:36.351 --> 02:36:38.492]  You know, I hate people that say they are, and they're not.
[02:36:38.512 --> 02:36:40.213]  You know, that's what really gets annoying to me.
[02:36:40.753 --> 02:36:42.214]  But seriously, let's get serious here.
[02:36:43.095 --> 02:36:45.056]  Paul, here's the big one.
[02:36:45.516 --> 02:36:46.937]  You raised it in all these hit pieces.
[02:36:47.987 --> 02:36:49.528]  Paul's too good for Alex.
[02:36:50.068 --> 02:36:52.048]  Paul wants to distance himself from Alex.
[02:36:52.649 --> 02:36:55.410]  Alex is jealous that Paul's as big as him or bigger.
[02:36:55.790 --> 02:37:00.591]  Paul, on record, and I'm not bragging about this, who flogged you to get on air?
[02:37:00.851 --> 02:37:02.032]  Who wants you to get on things?
[02:37:02.052 --> 02:37:04.213]  Who tells you that you're as good as me or better in many ways?
[02:37:04.813 --> 02:37:05.433]  They don't get it.
[02:37:05.653 --> 02:37:07.874]  I'm worried about the globalists and genetic engineering.
[02:37:08.154 --> 02:37:09.354]  I'm worried about world war.
[02:37:09.615 --> 02:37:11.215]  I'm worried about forced inoculations.
[02:37:11.315 --> 02:37:12.976]  I'm worried about the socialists taking over.
[02:37:13.236 --> 02:37:14.296]  I'm worried about globalism.
[02:37:14.496 --> 02:37:15.977]  I want you and others.
[02:37:16.037 --> 02:37:16.537]  I'm looking
[02:37:16.937 --> 02:37:24.104]  Like, you know, the great crew we have here, Owen Schroeder and others, and David Knight does a great job, but I'm looking for people like I was looking for you.
[02:37:24.905 --> 02:37:26.667]  They don't even give me that that we built in for.
[02:37:26.707 --> 02:37:29.550]  It's like I'm this raving lunatic dum-dum.
[02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:36.196]  When I could sit here and have a fake, you know, intellectual accent and pull it off, you know, three hours a day, but I'm just being real here.
[02:37:36.777 --> 02:37:37.297]  But again,
[02:37:38.118 --> 02:37:39.739]  It's not that I care that they lie about us.
[02:37:39.839 --> 02:37:44.042]  It's studying their psychology that they think we're like they are.
[02:37:44.322 --> 02:37:51.346]  That they'd be pissed at BuzzFeed or at Daily Beast if somebody was bigger than the big cheese.
[02:37:51.666 --> 02:37:53.388]  Don't they get I'm in a war?
[02:37:53.888 --> 02:37:54.668]  I want soldiers.
[02:37:54.788 --> 02:37:55.509]  I want generals.
[02:37:55.629 --> 02:37:56.349]  I want captains.
[02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:59.691]  I don't care if you're black, you're a woman, you're Hispanic, you're Asian.
[02:37:59.751 --> 02:38:02.653]  If you're cool and want to have freedom, let's get together.
[02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:03.294]  Does that make sense?
[02:38:04.625 --> 02:38:06.526]  Well, Alex, they're losers.
[02:38:06.826 --> 02:38:09.607]  I mean, losers resent other people's success.
[02:38:09.647 --> 02:38:15.168]  Successful people learn from other people's success and use it to create their own platforms.
[02:38:15.208 --> 02:38:23.551]  I mean, they've got your wife, quote again, your ex-wife says, once you hired me, she said basically it was a joint paranoiac enterprise from then on.
[02:38:23.951 --> 02:38:24.051]  OK.
[02:38:24.751 --> 02:38:29.572]  So, InfoWars was a raving lunatic paranoid enterprise from over a decade ago.
[02:38:29.912 --> 02:38:40.695]  Okay, so why were you editing InfoWars and writing many of the same stories about the same subjects for over 10 years if it was all a paranoid fever dream, okay?
[02:38:40.995 --> 02:38:45.296]  She was a central part of it and now it's like, oh no, it was just those two.
[02:38:45.756 --> 02:38:46.916]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:38:47.376 --> 02:38:48.657]  I mean, there's other stuff in there.
[02:38:48.677 --> 02:38:49.177]  You mentioned
[02:38:50.174 --> 02:38:52.896]  You know, snarky and entitled with a cigarette in his mouth.
[02:38:53.276 --> 02:38:54.897]  He didn't give a crap about anybody.
[02:38:55.237 --> 02:38:58.339]  Like, I visited you with my brother in 2005.
[02:38:59.039 --> 02:39:00.740]  Try to be as polite as possible.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:03.722]  She says, you see him on the clips, that's who he is.
[02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:05.089]  Mean what?
[02:39:05.549 --> 02:39:06.090]  Authentic?
[02:39:06.130 --> 02:39:06.610]  Truthful?
[02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:08.911]  I mean, you know, I've got friends.
[02:39:08.931 --> 02:39:11.692]  They don't think I'm this raving lunatic, this vicious person.
[02:39:11.972 --> 02:39:14.453]  Do you think maybe she's got an agenda, Alex?
[02:39:14.533 --> 02:39:15.954]  Maybe she's got a bias?
[02:39:16.414 --> 02:39:19.555]  But she's like the main source for the entire article.
[02:39:19.875 --> 02:39:22.176]  They keep going back to these insane quotes.
[02:39:22.796 --> 02:39:25.197]  I've got another one, which this is the funniest.
[02:39:25.598 --> 02:39:33.201]  A second former staffer said he heard regular phone calls in which Jones shouted, bullied and abused Watson, including by mocking his voice.
[02:39:33.861 --> 02:39:33.961]  So
[02:39:34.941 --> 02:39:40.605]  I've been abused, bullied and tormented and I'm still here 16 years later.
[02:39:40.625 --> 02:39:42.185]  Does that make much sense?
[02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:44.447]  It's just every single quote is...
[02:39:46.583 --> 02:39:48.944]  Well, let's be honest with people.
[02:39:49.304 --> 02:39:56.566]  You talk about that one person that worked here, that you only talked to a couple times when you were here, come like once a year, and then back there.
[02:39:56.586 --> 02:39:59.726]  And I would get in a meeting and I'd say, we have... And I got him his job, by the way.
[02:39:59.746 --> 02:40:00.646]  You know what?
[02:40:00.827 --> 02:40:01.787]  No gratitude there.
[02:40:02.747 --> 02:40:03.587]  Oh, you got him his job.
[02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:04.147]  I forgot that part.
[02:40:04.407 --> 02:40:04.587]  Yeah.
[02:40:04.947 --> 02:40:05.968]  Yeah, you said this guy might be good.
[02:40:05.988 --> 02:40:06.968]  Well, that's a strike against you then.
[02:40:07.708 --> 02:40:13.970]  But we're sitting there and I've got all the writers on the phone or in the room and I go, listen, we have a subscription to these photos.
[02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:18.251]  Use these or use them off Wikipedia where they're all vetted or go to the comments.
[02:40:18.531 --> 02:40:23.433]  I'm trying to explain that, you know, some of these things say they're copyright free, but they've got to be fully used and still credit them.
[02:40:24.093 --> 02:40:25.735]  Those are the type of meetings we have.
[02:40:26.216 --> 02:40:29.159]  It's not meetings where I go, here's what we're going to cover.
[02:40:29.219 --> 02:40:33.424]  I mean, let me tell you, I was glad you were anti-Trump, if that's what you really thought early on.
[02:40:33.504 --> 02:40:35.427]  I wasn't sure I was totally right, though my gut was.
[02:40:36.127 --> 02:40:38.090]  Did I ever call up and say, you better get on the Trump train?
[02:40:39.184 --> 02:40:40.325]  No, I mean that's what they claim.
[02:40:40.345 --> 02:40:44.288]  They say Alex Jones decided to turn his operation into a pro-Trump cheering section.
[02:40:44.609 --> 02:40:45.669]  What's and got the memo?
[02:40:46.090 --> 02:40:46.910]  I didn't get the memo.
[02:40:47.011 --> 02:40:59.481]  Obviously I had reservations about Trump to begin with and gradually, you know, I knew where it was heading and that this was the true core of the anti-authoritarian real resistance that led to him becoming president.
[02:40:59.521 --> 02:41:00.722]  So there was no memo.
[02:41:01.042 --> 02:41:03.924]  There was no bullying that made me support Donald Trump.
[02:41:04.445 --> 02:41:06.426]  I heard what he was saying and got on board.
[02:41:06.487 --> 02:41:07.768]  But did I ever even
[02:41:08.388 --> 02:41:10.415]  Call you about your anti-Trump articles.
[02:41:11.638 --> 02:41:12.319]  No, never.
[02:41:12.459 --> 02:41:17.482]  I mean, I made a video saying maybe it's a big ruse because of the Hillary photos, the wedding photo.
[02:41:17.502 --> 02:41:18.983]  You didn't even call me after that.
[02:41:19.404 --> 02:41:20.525]  I mean, there was no memo.
[02:41:21.085 --> 02:41:28.570]  Also, you know, after the Syria attack, we vehemently attacked his policy on Syria twice because it was a bad idea.
[02:41:28.951 --> 02:41:32.233]  So it isn't a Trump, you know, indoctrination call.
[02:41:32.253 --> 02:41:33.334]  That's what the left does.
[02:41:33.634 --> 02:41:34.415]  They don't allow any criticism.
[02:41:34.455 --> 02:41:34.855]  Exactly.
[02:41:34.895 --> 02:41:39.499]  They get talking points from John Podesta, Hillary, George Soros, they admit, and they follow it like it's God.
[02:41:40.319 --> 02:41:41.580]  And we're not, I respect you.
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:44.161]  You know, I'm thinking, maybe Paul's right, maybe Trump's bad.
[02:41:44.181 --> 02:41:56.087]  And we later learned in WikiLeaks, Hillary and the media did think he'd lose to her, so they actually gave him more coverage attacking him, but said, make him front and center to embarrass Republicans, he won't get the nomination.
[02:41:56.387 --> 02:41:57.548]  That blew up in their face.
[02:41:57.908 --> 02:42:04.131]  They did the same thing to us, so your initial instinct that they're kind of pushing him was true, but only because they didn't get it, Paul.
[02:42:05.373 --> 02:42:05.973]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:06.033 --> 02:42:13.877]  I mean, even today, I have like ding-dong fights with Trump sycophants on Twitter who will never question anything he does.
[02:42:13.917 --> 02:42:16.738]  And I lose like 5,000 Twitter followers.
[02:42:16.778 --> 02:42:18.098]  It doesn't even benefit me.
[02:42:18.439 --> 02:42:20.159]  But obviously, I'm not a sycophant.
[02:42:20.219 --> 02:42:22.400]  Obviously, I still have my own thought process.
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:23.921]  I can think independently.
[02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:32.244]  So the whole idea that there was a memo and that we were forced to do all this, complete and utter pablum, just like everything else in this hit piece and every other hit piece.
[02:42:32.264 --> 02:42:33.765]  And notice they've never got the memo.
[02:42:34.025 --> 02:42:35.606]  They never show these memos that everybody's getting.
[02:42:36.687 --> 02:42:37.327]  I didn't get a memo.
[02:42:37.367 --> 02:42:38.588]  Have I ever written you a memo?
[02:42:39.909 --> 02:42:40.089]  No.
[02:42:40.329 --> 02:42:41.350]  Never.
[02:42:42.831 --> 02:42:44.552]  Do I even use email?
[02:42:44.572 --> 02:42:45.893]  Do I even use email, Paul?
[02:42:46.813 --> 02:42:48.314]  You don't use email at all, no.
[02:42:49.035 --> 02:42:49.815]  How do I communicate?
[02:42:51.136 --> 02:42:52.357]  Text message and phone calls.
[02:42:53.017 --> 02:42:53.798]  There was no memo.
[02:42:54.578 --> 02:42:56.179]  That's actually a conspiracy theory.
[02:42:56.219 --> 02:42:56.920]  There was no memo.
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:57.840]  Just like Trump.
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:42:59.181]  Text messages or phone calls.
[02:42:59.201 --> 02:43:02.323]  We'll be back.
[02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:07.653]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:43:58.969 --> 02:44:00.530]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:44:04.414 --> 02:44:04.854]  Good morning.
[02:44:05.355 --> 02:44:06.416]  My name is Andrew Grossman.
[02:44:06.796 --> 02:44:08.738]  I'm a partner at the law firm Baker Hostetler.
[02:44:08.898 --> 02:44:12.721]  I represent Alex and InfoWars in the lawsuit that was filed by Brendan Gilmore.
[02:44:12.741 --> 02:44:26.993]  This morning, we asked the District Court to dismiss Mr. Gilmore's lawsuit, to require Mr. Gilmore to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding to his lawsuit, and to sanction Mr. Gilmore for using a federal court to wage a publicity stunt.
[02:44:27.393 --> 02:44:28.615]  Now let me be clear about this.
[02:44:29.015 --> 02:44:32.720]  Mr. Gilmore's claims against Alex Jones and Infowars are legally defective.
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.264]  We are confident that the suit will be thrown out of court.
[02:44:36.644 --> 02:44:40.289]  But make no mistake, vexatious lawsuits like this one are dangerous.
[02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:43.633]  Because they seek to chip away at our cherished First Amendment rights.
[02:44:44.053 --> 02:44:47.656]  The First Amendment gives all Americans the right to have their say on today's news.
[02:44:48.116 --> 02:44:57.323]  Alex Jones thought it was strange that Mr. Gilmour was popping up in all the media coverage on the events in Charlottesville, with what seemed like the same anti-Trump talking points every time.
[02:44:57.443 --> 02:45:00.305]  And that is exactly what Mr. Jones questioned.
[02:45:00.325 --> 02:45:05.488]  Was the media, with Mr. Gilmour's eager assistance, spinning the story against President Trump?
[02:45:06.269 --> 02:45:10.472]  That is the kind of probing question that every cable news analyst, every columnist,
[02:45:10.852 --> 02:45:14.496]  And every American who cares about what's going on in this country asks every day.
[02:45:15.076 --> 02:45:18.820]  They try to make sense of what they see reported in the news, and then they say what they think.
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:22.043]  The First Amendment absolutely protects that speech.
[02:45:22.383 --> 02:45:23.744]  Now, Mr. Gilmour disagrees.
[02:45:24.385 --> 02:45:27.688]  He obviously opposes Alex Jones's political viewpoint.
[02:45:28.209 --> 02:45:33.374]  He says that InfoWords is not what he considers to be responsible journalism, and that it can therefore be suppressed.
[02:45:34.014 --> 02:45:40.340]  His lawyers say that the law should distinguish between speech that informs the public and speech that they think misinforms the public.
[02:45:40.781 --> 02:45:49.970]  But the whole point of the First Amendment is that people like Mr. Gilmour and his lawyers do not get to decide whether their political opponents are allowed to have a voice.
[02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:54.153]  They do not get to decide what the public is allowed to hear.
[02:45:54.693 --> 02:46:01.078]  That fundamental misunderstanding of our First Amendment rights is just one of the reasons that Mr. Gilmour's suit has to be thrown out.
[02:46:01.398 --> 02:46:10.104]  As a matter of principle, no one should be able to drag their political opponents into court as a publicity stunt to harass them for their protected speech.
[02:46:10.224 --> 02:46:17.530]  That kind of abuse must have consequences, so that when people like Mr. Gilmour are thinking about filing suit, they think first before they do so.
[02:46:18.050 --> 02:46:25.196]  And that's why we're asking the court to find that Mr. Gilmour's lawsuit is what the law calls a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
[02:46:25.696 --> 02:46:35.445]  If the court agrees, Mr. Gilmour will be required to reimburse InfoWars for the expense of responding and will be subject to additional monetary sanctions.
[02:46:36.125 --> 02:46:38.447]  Mr. Gilmour brought these consequences on himself.
[02:46:39.028 --> 02:46:43.712]  He left it the chance to file a lawsuit instead of exercising his own First Amendment rights to talk back.
[02:46:44.452 --> 02:46:57.502]  We can only hope that he will come to understand the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' words, that when it comes to fighting perceived falsehoods and fallacies, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.
[02:46:57.522 --> 02:46:59.583]  And with that, I'll turn it back to Alex.
[02:46:59.803 --> 02:47:00.164]  Thank you.
[02:47:06.809 --> 02:47:09.491]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.237 --> 02:47:25.080]  All right, let's just cut this luscious Motley Crue off right now so we go right back to Paul Watson and some of these phone calls.
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:27.641]  Tom in London, Danny in Sarasota, Florida.
[02:47:28.081 --> 02:47:39.046]  But Paul, what would you call this point in time we're in historically when the big corporations, the media, they're all calling for us to be banned.
[02:47:39.067 --> 02:47:40.207]  We've already been shadow banned.
[02:47:40.767 --> 02:47:44.029]  We're still reaching record numbers of people thanks to the audience getting the word out.
[02:47:46.018 --> 02:47:49.543]  I think as long as people realize that we're in the middle of the fight, we're going to win.
[02:47:49.583 --> 02:47:51.706]  But if people go back to sleep, we're in trouble.
[02:47:51.726 --> 02:47:52.247]  What do you think, Paul?
[02:47:58.391 --> 02:48:06.118]  Of course, we've entered into an age of celebrity now where no celebrity has anything authentic to say, anything interesting to say.
[02:48:06.538 --> 02:48:10.902]  So basically, basically, Kanye comes out and says, I don't hate the president.
[02:48:10.982 --> 02:48:13.143]  I like the sitting president of the United States.
[02:48:13.464 --> 02:48:22.211]  In what world should it be controversial for a well-known personality to say that he has things in common and likes the president of the United States?
[02:48:22.751 --> 02:48:25.574]  Look at the absolute freak out in response to it.
[02:48:26.094 --> 02:48:28.036]  Look at the Comedy Central hit piece.
[02:48:28.436 --> 02:48:33.321]  Look at how they've been freaking out about us claiming to be the new counterculture for the past year.
[02:48:33.741 --> 02:48:36.544]  Because it has an essence of truth about it.
[02:48:36.924 --> 02:48:38.606]  I mean, I've said repeatedly
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.220]  I get messages.
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:54.944]  Most of the messages I get every day are from kids, 16, 17, 18 year olds in universities, in schools, saying it's the new cool edgy rebellious thing to watch your videos, to watch videos by Jordan Peterson.
[02:48:54.964 --> 02:48:57.725]  I mean, Jordan Peterson, he's a rock star.
[02:48:58.085 --> 02:48:59.945]  He packs out venues.
[02:48:59.985 --> 02:49:01.006]  You can't get in them.
[02:49:01.286 --> 02:49:04.387]  It's like £200 just to get in his venue at this point.
[02:49:04.747 --> 02:49:05.707]  He's a new rock star.
[02:49:06.188 --> 02:49:07.372]  What does he represent?
[02:49:07.693 --> 02:49:10.542]  The antithesis of identity politics.
[02:49:11.003 --> 02:49:12.387]  So in this Comedy Central piece...
[02:49:13.268 --> 02:49:19.811]  They claim that being punk, being counter-culture, has to implicitly embrace identity politics.
[02:49:20.192 --> 02:49:30.397]  Yet the new rock stars that all the kids, all the twenty-somethings are going to see, people like Jordan Peterson, they're going to see someone who represents the very opposite of that.
[02:49:30.757 --> 02:49:37.601]  That's why they're panicking, because it is seen as avant-garde to rebel against a culture... And what does Jordan Peterson say?
[02:49:38.761 --> 02:49:41.223]  He says the radical thing that there are two sexes?
[02:49:42.352 --> 02:49:42.592]  Yeah.
[02:49:42.752 --> 02:49:48.157]  I mean, that's the level of crazy town that it's avant-garde to say that the 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[02:49:49.578 --> 02:49:51.039]  Well, this is the point I made in my video.
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:59.366]  You go back to the 70s, who was it that was trying to no-platform offensive speech, offensive comedy, offensive music, offensive movies?
[02:49:59.687 --> 02:50:01.728]  It was the religious right, generally.
[02:50:02.109 --> 02:50:03.390]  The tables have turned.
[02:50:03.850 --> 02:50:04.771]  Everything's flipped.
[02:50:05.251 --> 02:50:11.892]  Now they're literally, the USA Today are coming out with articles saying, oh these offensive song lyrics shouldn't be allowed now.
[02:50:12.312 --> 02:50:13.853]  Oh maybe we should ban cheerleading.
[02:50:13.913 --> 02:50:20.954]  And the left is mad, the left is mad at Trump supporters for not getting rid of him because he might have had girlfriends or something.
[02:50:21.234 --> 02:50:23.755]  Which we're not endorsing but we didn't elect him for that.
[02:50:24.075 --> 02:50:25.995]  And so they're going, oh you Christians are hypocrites.
[02:50:26.495 --> 02:50:29.016]  No, the Christians are the opposite of being hypocrites.
[02:50:29.636 --> 02:50:31.860]  Because if Trump had said he didn't do that, then they'd be mad.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:32.641]  He didn't say that.
[02:50:32.921 --> 02:50:34.063]  They didn't hire him for that.
[02:50:34.083 --> 02:50:34.624]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:50:34.865 --> 02:50:38.510]  The left is pissed at the evangelicals for not being mad at Trump.
[02:50:39.912 --> 02:50:45.875]  Well, I don't think anybody voted for Trump thinking that he would be a pure, straight-line Christian conservative.
[02:50:45.895 --> 02:50:48.116]  I mean, that would be the ultimate form of naivety.
[02:50:48.616 --> 02:50:50.557]  But, I mean, they're the ones trying to ban everything.
[02:50:50.977 --> 02:50:57.641]  You know, Grit Girls, Page Free Girls, they're basically now saying we shouldn't... I mean, in London, we're not allowed to show beach body ads.
[02:50:58.141 --> 02:51:00.062]  They're a lie... Because your Islamic mayor says no!
[02:51:00.942 --> 02:51:06.769]  And I have articles today where they've got major political parties in Europe saying, ban, segregate women and men on buses.
[02:51:06.829 --> 02:51:07.249]  It's here!
[02:51:07.770 --> 02:51:10.012]  And the Green Party's telling women, don't wear skirts!
[02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:15.238]  And by the way, the far left leader of the Labour Party... My party says, wear skirts!
[02:51:15.558 --> 02:51:16.459]  Wear skirts!
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:17.420]  Sorry Paul, go ahead.
[02:51:18.413 --> 02:51:18.894]  Belgium.
[02:51:19.074 --> 02:51:25.541]  They had the leader of the Islam Party, which has got elected councillors in Belgium, get up on a television debate show.
[02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:36.034]  He not only refused to shake hands with the women on that panel, on that debate show, he refused to look them in the eye, or even look in their direction, when they addressed him.
[02:51:36.534 --> 02:51:40.237]  This is the kind of attitude the far left is now aligning itself with.
[02:51:40.577 --> 02:51:43.719]  They're also calling for gender segregated public transport.
[02:51:44.120 --> 02:51:45.521]  Who's calling for that in the UK?
[02:51:45.821 --> 02:51:46.741]  Jeremy Corbyn.
[02:51:46.761 --> 02:51:47.702]  And let's think about that.
[02:51:47.762 --> 02:51:51.105]  The Muslims won't even talk to women in a debate.
[02:51:51.465 --> 02:51:52.906]  And the left just loves it.
[02:51:54.073 --> 02:51:54.253]  Yeah.
[02:51:54.654 --> 02:51:56.295]  Because they want women to be their slaves.
[02:51:56.515 --> 02:51:57.496]  I'm telling you, I can't believe it.
[02:51:58.056 --> 02:51:59.938]  I just, it gets crazier and crazier.
[02:51:59.958 --> 02:52:00.939]  Paul, let's go to some phone calls.
[02:52:01.319 --> 02:52:06.103]  We could go on for hours, but we're going to do a little bit in the next hour, keep Paul on, then Joel Gilbert will take over.
[02:52:06.864 --> 02:52:09.707]  But let's go to Danny, no, no, no, Tom in London first.
[02:52:10.307 --> 02:52:27.624]  Tom, you're on the air with Paul Watson, his Britannic Majesty's Secret Service Defender of the Realm, Eighth Army's Great Overlord, Field Marshal of the Cohorts of the Visitors of the Cottages of the Appendages of the Shrubberies.
[02:52:28.365 --> 02:52:29.446]  Paul, that give you PTSD?
[02:52:30.607 --> 02:52:31.088]  I'm triggered.
[02:52:32.313 --> 02:52:35.355]  Tom from Her Majesty's London, England.
[02:52:35.695 --> 02:52:39.657]  We herald you entering into the United States of America.
[02:52:40.118 --> 02:52:42.239]  You are on the air with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:52:42.579 --> 02:52:43.680]  Welcome, my good friend.
[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:49.003]  I feel very bullied by you putting on that accent.
[02:52:52.145 --> 02:52:59.089]  By the way, I'm the person who phoned you in 2015 predicting Trump and Brexit.
[02:52:59.955 --> 02:53:01.316]  I remember you did call a predicted.
[02:53:01.336 --> 02:53:02.998]  You made some other predictions that haven't come true though.
[02:53:03.538 --> 02:53:04.199]  Go ahead!
[02:53:05.099 --> 02:53:07.381]  I dare you to challenge me!
[02:53:07.401 --> 02:53:10.043]  I have royal right to the crown!
[02:53:12.625 --> 02:53:20.552]  By way of genetic force and the first alignment of the Cambridge decision, I am rightful heir to the Britannic throne!
[02:53:20.572 --> 02:53:26.597]  I actually haven't yet made predictions that haven't come true.
[02:53:27.575 --> 02:53:41.840]  Um, my predictions that I made last time, my phone's use, haven't come true yet, because, um, well, I, I, well, I predicted that North Korea was a smokescreen, and the real, uh, the real thing going on was, was Iran.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.101]  And I also predicted that Trump would be removed by autumn.
[02:53:47.121 --> 02:53:48.322]  Uh, fall.
[02:53:48.802 --> 02:53:49.602]  Fall in American.
[02:53:50.402 --> 02:53:52.203]  Um... And that was last year?
[02:53:52.923 --> 02:53:55.624]  And you have been proven disgracefully incorrect!
[02:53:57.222 --> 02:53:59.803]  Well, that remains to be seen.
[02:53:59.903 --> 02:54:05.285]  I mean, Trump, I still think that's going to happen to Trump before your elections in November.
[02:54:05.625 --> 02:54:07.846]  But, he can save himself.
[02:54:08.206 --> 02:54:09.307]  And I just want to mention that.
[02:54:09.447 --> 02:54:19.091]  By kneeling to the Barney Stone, and kneeling to the Great, fostering if he kisses the rear end of the Great Leprechaun, he will be free.
[02:54:19.131 --> 02:54:19.731]  Is that the secret?
[02:54:20.931 --> 02:54:21.412]  No, no.
[02:54:21.912 --> 02:54:23.933]  It's what he does in North Korea.
[02:54:26.063 --> 02:54:38.454]  What's on offer with North Korea is Kim Jong-un will announce the peace treaty, the denuclearization and reunification talks, and he'll give Trump the credit.
[02:54:39.034 --> 02:54:39.254]  Right.
[02:54:39.574 --> 02:54:45.920]  But to get that, Trump has to do certain things and also not screw it up.
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:49.883]  Otherwise, he'll get much less than that, which won't save him.
[02:54:50.583 --> 02:54:56.026]  So how he gets the full jackpot is he has to go to Pyongyang.
[02:54:56.846 --> 02:55:01.949]  Now, this is about the Chinese culture and the North Korean culture.
[02:55:03.069 --> 02:55:05.931]  It's about faith and saving faith.
[02:55:07.952 --> 02:55:09.772]  And not just their faith.
[02:55:09.832 --> 02:55:14.054]  If he goes there, they'll feel like it's so embarrassing to everybody and they don't make a deal.
[02:55:15.635 --> 02:55:15.975]  Well, no.
[02:55:17.879 --> 02:55:20.582]  Right now, Kim Jong-un would lose enormous faith.
[02:55:21.223 --> 02:55:22.865]  This is a cultural thing.
[02:55:22.925 --> 02:55:25.889]  You know, faith is all important.
[02:55:25.929 --> 02:55:28.051]  Tom, but we're taking calls for Paul Watson.
[02:55:29.032 --> 02:55:31.776]  And the fact that every word he says is directly programmed by me.
[02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:36.935]  Yeah, but he knows about this sort of thing as well.
[02:55:36.975 --> 02:55:38.937]  He had a Chinese partner, didn't he?
[02:55:39.598 --> 02:55:40.900]  So maybe he knows about the face.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:41.701]  The Chinese man, yes.
[02:55:42.842 --> 02:55:43.983]  My husband was Chinese.
[02:55:44.164 --> 02:55:45.485]  I had a Chinese husband.
[02:55:45.505 --> 02:55:46.306]  He had a Chinese wife.
[02:55:46.787 --> 02:55:47.728]  I gotta go, Tom.
[02:55:48.188 --> 02:55:49.129]  Let's get serious here.
[02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:51.632]  Paul, you want to comment on what Tom was saying?
[02:55:53.260 --> 02:56:00.265]  Well, I mean, North Korea, we put out, you remember Trump's big button, big nuclear button tweet at the beginning of January?
[02:56:00.606 --> 02:56:07.451]  They literally had MSNBC commentators on air saying that this would lead to the annihilation of the planet.
[02:56:07.931 --> 02:56:10.233]  Those tweets haven't aged very well, have they?
[02:56:10.273 --> 02:56:13.836]  There was another one, which I tweeted today, basically saying the same thing.
[02:56:14.716 --> 02:56:16.116]  That it would lead to World War 3.
[02:56:16.656 --> 02:56:23.238]  Ben Rhodes said, every taunt back and forth between Trump and Kim Jong-un makes de-escalation and diplomacy less possible.
[02:56:23.698 --> 02:56:25.638]  They were all proven spectacularly wrong.
[02:56:25.698 --> 02:56:26.859]  Pompeo's met with him.
[02:56:27.239 --> 02:56:30.879]  We've got genuine hope for peace between those two nations.
[02:56:31.199 --> 02:56:32.020]  This is monumental.
[02:56:32.180 --> 02:56:33.900]  Imagine if Obama had achieved that.
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.821]  They would be lavishing... Oh, they'd be throwing rose petals on the ground.
[02:56:36.841 --> 02:56:40.961]  They'd be, they'd just be, oh, oh, the British royalty!
[02:56:41.302 --> 02:56:42.982]  It'd be like Obama was royalty!
[02:56:44.434 --> 02:56:46.575]  Yeah, they would be absolutely lavishing him.
[02:56:47.076 --> 02:56:48.596]  I mean, what is Trump's approval rating?
[02:56:48.616 --> 02:56:50.698]  Did you just say lavish the royalty?
[02:56:51.718 --> 02:56:52.839]  Lavish the royalty.
[02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:55.120]  But yes, it's massive.
[02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:56.041]  It's positive.
[02:56:56.121 --> 02:56:57.822]  It's a genuine step towards peace.
[02:56:57.862 --> 02:56:59.763]  We don't know if it's going to be followed through yet.
[02:57:00.083 --> 02:57:01.744]  But they're not going to give him any credit for it.
[02:57:02.165 --> 02:57:03.385]  The voters know that, though.
[02:57:03.405 --> 02:57:04.806]  You know, his approval rating's at, what, 50%?
[02:57:05.426 --> 02:57:06.287]  Here's the question.
[02:57:06.327 --> 02:57:10.469]  Will Trump get a Nobel Peace Prize if they denuclearize the peninsula?
[02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:11.550]  Probably not.
[02:57:11.610 --> 02:57:12.471]  They'll give it to Obama.
[02:57:13.491 --> 02:57:16.312]  Trump could solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
[02:57:17.033 --> 02:57:19.014]  They could have a peace deal with North and South Korea.
[02:57:19.534 --> 02:57:21.695]  You know, Venezuela could be prosperous again.
[02:57:21.735 --> 02:57:25.997]  They would still not give him anything because they're incredibly biased.
[02:57:26.137 --> 02:57:26.857]  Let me say this then.
[02:57:27.057 --> 02:57:31.419]  I nominate Obama for a peace prize if we denuclearize the peninsula.
[02:57:31.959 --> 02:57:32.400]  And Hillary.
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:34.540]  She came, she saw, they died.
[02:57:35.501 --> 02:57:43.083]  I nominate Hillary Rodham Clinton to be Empress of the World after 5,000... Don't leave Watson, you're staying in the next hour.
[02:57:43.683 --> 02:57:44.803]  Look at him trying to leave, look at that!
[02:57:45.283 --> 02:57:50.044]  Running from me, running against the... Go to that camera, look at him!
[02:57:50.365 --> 02:57:51.725]  He won't escape the fourth hour!
[02:57:54.065 --> 02:58:12.354]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:58:12.455 --> 02:58:18.378]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:58:18.738 --> 02:58:19.418]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:58:19.538 --> 02:58:22.700]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:24.301]  And so much more.
[02:58:24.881 --> 02:58:26.022]  It is concentrated.
[02:58:26.242 --> 02:58:27.943]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:58:27.963 --> 02:58:33.667]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:58:33.767 --> 02:58:34.968]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:58:34.988 --> 02:58:36.909]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:58:37.009 --> 02:58:39.391]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:58:39.591 --> 02:58:40.852]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:58:41.032 --> 02:58:42.853]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:58:43.394 --> 02:58:43.994]  Immune Wall.
[02:58:44.114 --> 02:58:45.435]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:59:13.187 --> 02:59:13.907]  The reality is

[02:59:56.391 --> 02:59:58.312]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:58.712 --> 03:00:03.153]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:14.758 --> 03:00:22.921]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.184 --> 03:00:25.585]  Paul told me he's got a date.
[03:00:26.285 --> 03:00:26.925]  He's got to leave.
[03:00:26.965 --> 03:00:28.366]  Seriously, he's going to stay into the hour with us.
[03:00:28.406 --> 03:00:31.087]  He says she looks like Baroness from G.I.
[03:00:31.107 --> 03:00:31.427]  Joe.
[03:00:31.487 --> 03:00:32.467]  Now that's awesome.
[03:00:33.468 --> 03:00:34.628]  And she's Russian, folks.
[03:00:36.189 --> 03:00:37.149]  Russian handler.
[03:00:37.229 --> 03:00:38.910]  That's not the good one.
[03:00:39.190 --> 03:00:39.750]  There you go.
[03:00:39.850 --> 03:00:41.731]  It's like Dana Lashford.
[03:00:41.851 --> 03:00:44.892]  I'm not going to leave my wife, but I don't know.
[03:00:44.933 --> 03:00:45.533]  For Baroness?
[03:00:46.113 --> 03:00:47.053]  Paul, do you like Baroness?
[03:00:48.794 --> 03:00:50.775]  I think that's... You're putting words in my mouth, Alex.
[03:00:50.815 --> 03:00:52.876]  I don't have a date, but yeah, she's not too bad.
[03:00:53.885 --> 03:00:55.406]  Let's put Baroness back on screen.
[03:00:55.426 --> 03:00:56.487]  Stop giving me memos.
[03:00:57.268 --> 03:00:58.989]  The memo is find the Baroness.
[03:01:00.770 --> 03:01:01.411]  Okay, mission.
[03:01:01.551 --> 03:01:03.413]  What do you think Baroness is thinking about right there?
[03:01:05.394 --> 03:01:06.435]  Well, it's a family show.
[03:01:06.995 --> 03:01:08.597]  Cobra, that's what she's thinking about.
[03:01:09.097 --> 03:01:11.619]  She's thinking about Cobra Commander!
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:13.781]  I am the Supreme Ruler!
[03:01:14.421 --> 03:01:15.182]  You like that poem?
[03:01:16.503 --> 03:01:17.564]  Yeah, I remember that one.
[03:01:17.904 --> 03:01:20.166]  Now, is this abuse or is this my Tourette Syndrome?
[03:01:20.786 --> 03:01:21.467]  Be honest with people.
[03:01:23.007 --> 03:01:23.968]  It's kind of to rats.
[03:01:24.028 --> 03:01:30.193]  I mean, after you've been saying the same thing literally for 16 years, it's kind of, uh, you know, I forgive you for it now.
[03:01:30.433 --> 03:01:34.896]  I kind of... And see, now they know secretly we're discussing the Baroness every couple days, right?
[03:01:35.297 --> 03:01:36.258]  Well, it could be code.
[03:01:36.318 --> 03:01:37.198]  It could be code, yeah.
[03:01:38.479 --> 03:01:39.760]  Well, I think there's code right there.
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:42.903]  Is there... I don't think there's any codes needed, but I like.
[03:01:43.003 --> 03:01:43.303]  Okay.
[03:01:43.643 --> 03:01:44.424]  Hey, let's get serious.
[03:01:45.105 --> 03:01:46.045]  Danny, you're on the air.
[03:01:46.346 --> 03:01:47.406]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:01:47.987 --> 03:01:49.068]  Go ahead and ask your question.
[03:01:50.467 --> 03:01:54.649]  I subscribed to five supplements, but if I could only buy one, it'd be X2.
[03:01:54.689 --> 03:01:55.810]  I hope it doesn't disappear.
[03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:58.771]  I'm telling you, that's not a thing to sell it.
[03:01:58.811 --> 03:02:00.712]  I mean, it's selling it good, but I'm worried.
[03:02:01.072 --> 03:02:01.772]  It's hard to get it.
[03:02:04.174 --> 03:02:05.174]  Question for Paul.
[03:02:06.235 --> 03:02:14.599]  If you could critique Alex, what would you like to see him stop doing that you think distracts from the message he's delivering?
[03:02:16.540 --> 03:02:17.300]  Be real, Paul.
[03:02:18.149 --> 03:02:27.975]  Well, people say Alex interrupts his guests too much, and although you've gotten better at that more recently, so I guess I'd say that, but it's improved a lot over the past year, hasn't it?
[03:02:28.235 --> 03:02:29.836]  You don't interrupt people that much anymore.
[03:02:30.776 --> 03:02:32.117]  That's number one on my list.
[03:02:35.139 --> 03:02:37.981]  We love you, Alex, but we'd like to hear what your guests have to say, too.
[03:02:38.601 --> 03:02:39.802]  I'm getting better, Danny.
[03:02:40.922 --> 03:02:43.544]  Haven't I gotten better, Danny?
[03:02:44.504 --> 03:02:45.605]  Yes, you're getting better.
[03:02:46.445 --> 03:02:47.186]  We love you, Danny.
[03:02:48.155 --> 03:02:48.755]  All right, thanks.
[03:02:49.116 --> 03:02:49.956]  Oh, Danny boy.
[03:02:49.976 --> 03:02:57.420]  Some of these calls are like... I can't figure out what they're saying.
[03:02:59.241 --> 03:03:00.522]  Lots of hate from Austin.
[03:03:00.782 --> 03:03:02.182]  Here, Sam from the ATX.
[03:03:02.543 --> 03:03:04.924]  You're on the air with His Royal Majesty.
[03:03:04.944 --> 03:03:05.824]  Go ahead.
[03:03:08.085 --> 03:03:11.887]  I prefer the title Lord Protector of the Realms.
[03:03:12.428 --> 03:03:13.588]  That would be Wellington.
[03:03:15.902 --> 03:03:16.843]  That was Cromwell.
[03:03:17.564 --> 03:03:20.367]  That's right, Cromwell of the whole Protestant movement.
[03:03:20.387 --> 03:03:21.728]  You're right, Lord Wellington was the guy.
[03:03:22.999 --> 03:03:27.360]  Guys, this is standard COINTELPRO operation trying to bring friction internally.
[03:03:28.081 --> 03:03:33.322]  Gunderson from the FBI tells all about him doing this to the Black Panthers in his memoirs.
[03:03:33.762 --> 03:03:35.363]  And this is how we resist.
[03:03:35.523 --> 03:03:36.943]  This is how we resist.
[03:03:37.283 --> 03:03:38.003]  We're forgiving.
[03:03:38.063 --> 03:03:39.544]  We don't backbite one another.
[03:03:39.644 --> 03:03:42.725]  And you guys are really good examples of that, Paul.
[03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:43.465]  No, you're right.
[03:03:43.485 --> 03:03:43.785]  You're right.
[03:03:43.825 --> 03:03:47.626]  These hit pieces are trying to manipulate us when we battle over the crown.
[03:03:47.966 --> 03:03:48.947]  The crown is freedom.
[03:03:49.227 --> 03:03:50.047]  We don't want the crown.
[03:03:50.976 --> 03:03:52.256]  Amen, and that's a bunch of bull.
[03:03:52.357 --> 03:03:55.898]  The Bible says in the Last Judgment, the saints will throw down their crowns.
[03:03:58.539 --> 03:04:02.440]  And give glory and honor to the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, absolutely.
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:06.341]  You know, I'm not from the ATX, but I wanted to see how the other half lived.
[03:04:06.441 --> 03:04:10.903]  I was coming back from the border at the governor's racketeering trial, and I thought I'd stop in.
[03:04:10.983 --> 03:04:19.846]  Man, I rocked into the Starbucks on South Lamar in my InfoWars t-shirt, and let me tell ya, I was the only InfoWarrior in the place.
[03:04:20.598 --> 03:04:30.202]  We make a point to be polite, to tip well, to say please and thank you, hold doors for people, but you guys experience a lot of hatred and I just appreciate you.
[03:04:30.242 --> 03:04:32.043]  I commend you for holding up under that.
[03:04:33.503 --> 03:04:34.584]  Well, Sam, I'm going to come back.
[03:04:34.644 --> 03:04:35.284]  Paul's got to go.
[03:04:35.304 --> 03:04:37.505]  He's got a date with the Baroness, but I want to talk more about that.
[03:04:37.565 --> 03:04:39.726]  It's an honor to do it because these are weak people.
[03:04:39.766 --> 03:04:44.828]  We have to stand strong in their face, but yeah, living here in Austin is quite interesting now with people.
[03:04:44.868 --> 03:04:47.289]  Paul, I'm going to call you on the wall with your memo.
[03:04:47.329 --> 03:04:49.069]  All right?
[03:04:49.650 --> 03:04:50.110]  You do that.
[03:04:51.385 --> 03:04:52.066]  Good job, Paul.
[03:04:54.050 --> 03:04:54.491]  Have fun.
[03:04:54.511 --> 03:04:55.613]  Have a pint for me, alright?
[03:04:56.415 --> 03:04:56.976]  Will do.
[03:04:56.996 --> 03:04:57.758]  Take care.
[03:04:58.319 --> 03:05:00.603]  There goes Paul with the Baroness tonight in London.
[03:05:04.052 --> 03:05:13.360]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:14.201 --> 03:05:21.488]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[03:05:22.228 --> 03:05:28.569]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:34.630]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:05:35.231 --> 03:05:47.373]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:05:48.053 --> 03:05:53.577]  Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[03:05:54.358 --> 03:05:57.860]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[03:05:58.440 --> 03:06:03.224]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle today.
[03:06:09.417 --> 03:06:10.937]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:11.257 --> 03:06:17.578]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:28.480]  This hour brought to you by my girlfriend, the Baroness.
[03:06:30.741 --> 03:06:31.801]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:31.821 --> 03:06:35.401]  I'm about to turn the baton over to our next segment to the great Joel Gilbert, the filmmaker.
[03:06:36.602 --> 03:06:38.082]  Taking some phone calls right now, though.
[03:06:39.747 --> 03:06:41.889]  But getting serious here for just a moment.
[03:06:43.930 --> 03:06:45.912]  Listen how good that guitar sounds right now if you listen on the radio.
[03:06:49.754 --> 03:06:50.635]  Humans made that.
[03:06:51.035 --> 03:06:51.836]  Humans are awesome.
[03:06:51.876 --> 03:06:52.737]  I'm a fan of humans.
[03:06:53.717 --> 03:06:55.479]  And I'm looking past the golden age.
[03:06:56.239 --> 03:06:57.520]  The age of infinity.
[03:06:58.941 --> 03:06:59.842]  And we're so close.
[03:07:00.622 --> 03:07:01.363]  I can taste it.
[03:07:01.883 --> 03:07:02.964]  And God's made it for us.
[03:07:03.464 --> 03:07:04.065]  And I'm ready.
[03:07:04.986 --> 03:07:05.166]  But!
[03:07:06.610 --> 03:07:22.502]  I was talking to Sam in Texas, who came into the ATX, just experienced it wearing an InfoWars shirt in a South Lamar Starbucks, another one he's talking about, next door to a pool hall, and they were very hateful to it.
[03:07:24.003 --> 03:07:28.847]  Now people think that that would be something that intimidated me.
[03:07:30.401 --> 03:07:34.522]  When I'm out in Elgin or New Braunfels or wherever, it's nothing but fans.
[03:07:34.962 --> 03:07:36.843]  Black people, white people, Hispanics, everybody.
[03:07:37.463 --> 03:07:40.824]  But in Austin, they still watch the comedy shows.
[03:07:40.864 --> 03:07:42.105]  They still watch Homeland.
[03:07:42.545 --> 03:07:45.246]  They think a real demon has entered their midst.
[03:07:46.826 --> 03:07:54.569]  And actually, I enjoy being at the grocery store and having somebody come over and scream and cuss at me only every once in a while, you know, every 50th person that goes by.
[03:07:55.409 --> 03:07:57.570]  Because I have an internal compass.
[03:07:59.116 --> 03:08:02.739]  And I know that I'm upsetting them because I'm challenging their whole system.
[03:08:03.439 --> 03:08:07.723]  But I wanted you to be able to, Sam, walk through that, describing where you said you came in from Texas.
[03:08:07.743 --> 03:08:10.325]  This is at ATX McCall, so I said Austin wrongly.
[03:08:10.725 --> 03:08:14.788]  Where you came from, what you saw, what you experienced, what InfoWars shirt you were wearing.
[03:08:14.828 --> 03:08:15.128]  Go ahead.
[03:08:17.130 --> 03:08:26.077]  Yes, Alex, I got a really nice InfoWars May the Truth Be With You black t-shirt, and you sent it to me, actually, for holding one day.
[03:08:26.557 --> 03:08:27.738]  I appreciate you doing that.
[03:08:28.331 --> 03:08:32.714]  And I wear it a lot of places, and I get commendations, too.
[03:08:33.255 --> 03:08:34.716]  People commend me for wearing it.
[03:08:34.776 --> 03:08:45.643]  They kind of have a look in their eye that, man, it takes some cajones to stand up to the persecution and to tell people what we really believe and where we really stand.
[03:08:45.803 --> 03:08:47.845]  But it's nothing new in Christianity.
[03:08:48.405 --> 03:08:51.367]  So, yes, I walked into Starbucks today.
[03:08:51.447 --> 03:08:53.368]  I know this is where your old offices were.
[03:08:55.245 --> 03:08:57.526]  I went in there and just had my latte.
[03:08:57.786 --> 03:09:02.207]  I don't think it helped me wake up near as much as my two brain forces that I popped.
[03:09:02.707 --> 03:09:10.609]  But I went in there to have my latte and to send you an email about the Mexican Army's reserves being put on alert for call-up today.
[03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:16.910]  And every person, every person takes a side-long look at that shirt.
[03:09:17.330 --> 03:09:21.011]  And they chat among themselves, hey, that's one of those guys.
[03:09:21.071 --> 03:09:22.231]  That's one of those enemies.
[03:09:22.371 --> 03:09:24.712]  That's one of the ones that we talk about.
[03:09:25.313 --> 03:09:25.775]  They're real.
[03:09:26.036 --> 03:09:26.418]  That's it.
[03:09:26.438 --> 03:09:27.322]  That's one right there.
[03:09:28.426 --> 03:09:30.475]  It's a badge I also wear proudly myself.
[03:09:32.372 --> 03:09:44.335]  And it's so sad, all we're trying to do is free market, freedom, everything that we know works, and they're just brainwashed by big corporations that think of them as morons, like Jeff Bezos.
[03:09:45.855 --> 03:09:56.297]  It's very frustrating, and I just wish that I could deprogram them, but you know, the thing is... The gospel has always been an offense, and I'm Pastor Sam, that's me.
[03:09:56.817 --> 03:10:00.198]  The gospel's always been an offense, it was an affront in England,
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:05.223]  Great heroes of the Reform in England, Tyndale Bible translators.
[03:10:05.563 --> 03:10:15.430]  And then in America, there was this Loyalist, Royalist, Catholic Anglican movement, and the people that stood up against it, they suffered great persecution.
[03:10:15.811 --> 03:10:19.273]  But because we stood for our Pilgrim values, that's how we got 1776.
[03:10:21.306 --> 03:10:24.047]  And people from around the world, they still don't understand freedom.
[03:10:24.128 --> 03:10:25.448]  And I travel to a lot of countries.
[03:10:25.468 --> 03:10:27.449]  I've been to all South America just recently.
[03:10:27.929 --> 03:10:32.572]  And people, one question they ask is, they let you do this and that in America?
[03:10:32.592 --> 03:10:34.633]  And they don't understand it.
[03:10:34.733 --> 03:10:35.994]  It's not that they let us do it.
[03:10:36.214 --> 03:10:38.135]  It's that they won't come and stop us!
[03:10:38.795 --> 03:10:42.337]  That nobody will come and stop us, because that's our culture.
[03:10:42.698 --> 03:10:46.100]  As we stand for righteousness, we execute judgment.
[03:10:46.200 --> 03:10:48.842]  And this is what the Bible says will happen at the end.
[03:10:49.022 --> 03:10:55.346]  The saints take the kingdom, and then, yes, we lay down our golden crowns before the Lamb and the Ancient of Days.
[03:10:56.974 --> 03:11:11.101]  Well, if anybody ever doubted Revelation with all the world government and the world taxation system and the world ID number and the world social score they call Skynet and the human animal cloning and all of it.
[03:11:11.121 --> 03:11:11.961]  I mean, it's here.
[03:11:12.781 --> 03:11:13.222]  It's here.
[03:11:14.784 --> 03:11:24.209]  I just did a massive teaching on that, some of the most confusing chapters of Revelation, chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15, and it's on YouTube.
[03:11:24.569 --> 03:11:37.116]  You just have to search Pastor Sam or Honnold Sam, and it will come up, and it talks about some things that are going to happen in reality that these liberal theologians have always made to be fairytale.
[03:11:37.276 --> 03:11:38.337]  And it's going to happen.
[03:11:38.397 --> 03:11:39.157]  We're going to see it.
[03:11:39.537 --> 03:11:40.798]  I put out a teaching on there.
[03:11:40.818 --> 03:11:42.359]  It's very controversial.
[03:11:43.527 --> 03:11:44.568]  We're about to see everything.
[03:11:44.628 --> 03:11:45.148]  Thanks a lot.
[03:11:45.168 --> 03:11:45.729]  God bless you.
[03:11:45.749 --> 03:11:46.989]  Look, I got all these callers.
[03:11:47.029 --> 03:11:48.050]  I can never get all these people.
[03:11:48.310 --> 03:11:51.492]  And I can't always get free t-shirts out when we have something to hold for an hour.
[03:11:51.512 --> 03:11:54.514]  Because most of these folks have only been holding about 30 minutes.
[03:11:54.554 --> 03:11:57.577]  But I got Gilbert here with a huge show lined up.
[03:11:57.917 --> 03:11:58.877]  So much key intel.
[03:12:00.218 --> 03:12:03.220]  The report on Russian active measures has come out.
[03:12:03.821 --> 03:12:04.841]  Trump, no collusion.
[03:12:08.664 --> 03:12:09.224]  We've got that.
[03:12:09.284 --> 03:12:09.845]  We've got Trump.
[03:12:12.017 --> 03:12:14.738]  Getting North Korea to sign a peace deal.
[03:12:14.838 --> 03:12:16.599]  I mean, is this what the Russians do?
[03:12:16.639 --> 03:12:17.399]  Give me a break, man.
[03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:20.961]  The Democrats have historically been with the Russians, folks.
[03:12:21.481 --> 03:12:21.941]  Give me a break.
[03:12:22.221 --> 03:12:23.522]  Joel Gilbert's made films about that.
[03:12:23.542 --> 03:12:24.122]  He can talk about it.
[03:12:24.662 --> 03:12:26.183]  Got Raphael in Brooklyn.
[03:12:27.143 --> 03:12:28.404]  Isaac and all these other people.
[03:12:31.765 --> 03:12:32.505]  Paul had to go.
[03:12:34.706 --> 03:12:37.207]  Let's talk to Gage in North Carolina.
[03:12:37.267 --> 03:12:37.968]  Gage, you're on the air.
[03:12:37.988 --> 03:12:38.488]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:39.807 --> 03:12:40.667]  You're awesome, dude.
[03:12:40.687 --> 03:12:42.448]  I'm on the brain force right now.
[03:12:42.468 --> 03:12:43.928]  Thank you, brother.
[03:12:44.268 --> 03:12:45.449]  Really, I got a question.
[03:12:45.869 --> 03:12:51.070]  How are we going to position ourselves against this global society on a daily basis?
[03:12:51.090 --> 03:12:52.131]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:12:52.171 --> 03:12:52.631]  Every day.
[03:12:53.231 --> 03:12:53.771]  Every day.
[03:12:53.851 --> 03:12:57.572]  When I go into Walmart, when I beat the robot, you know what I mean?
[03:12:58.173 --> 03:13:03.174]  Alright, we had some cussing there and had to drop that call.
[03:13:03.194 --> 03:13:03.954]  We're going to let him go.
[03:13:04.354 --> 03:13:05.835]  How do you position yourself against this?
[03:13:08.114 --> 03:13:10.257]  I think doing your research, making your own personal decisions.
[03:13:11.278 --> 03:13:12.519]  You know, you say you're going to Walmart.
[03:13:12.579 --> 03:13:15.162]  Well, Walmart's not half as bad as Amazon.
[03:13:16.103 --> 03:13:20.088]  And I still show up at my house, I'm like, it's like dog turds or something.
[03:13:20.108 --> 03:13:22.711]  There's like Amazon package on the kitchen table.
[03:13:22.751 --> 03:13:24.593]  I'm like, buy it somewhere else.
[03:13:24.613 --> 03:13:25.334]  Well, it's cheaper.
[03:13:25.374 --> 03:13:25.775]  It's quicker.
[03:13:26.095 --> 03:13:27.236]  Because they run scams.
[03:13:27.256 --> 03:13:28.178]  They got monopolies.
[03:13:29.329 --> 03:13:29.669]  Stop!
[03:13:29.809 --> 03:13:31.270]  People go, well, you've got an Amazon account.
[03:13:31.810 --> 03:13:37.971]  Because we keep the counterfeits off Amazon by having an Amazon account, but I don't promote it, and I don't discount stuff on there.
[03:13:39.052 --> 03:13:39.632]  Strategic.
[03:13:40.912 --> 03:13:45.433]  But we've got to support an economic ecosystem of liberty.
[03:13:46.033 --> 03:13:47.854]  And Jeff Bezos ain't it.
[03:13:52.213 --> 03:13:54.514]  I want to hear Teresa, even though Paul had to go.
[03:13:54.534 --> 03:13:57.875]  He had a hot date with Baroness of Cobra Commander.
[03:13:58.375 --> 03:14:00.316]  Teresa of Santa Cruz, California.
[03:14:00.336 --> 03:14:01.177]  You got a gift for us.
[03:14:01.557 --> 03:14:02.117]  Thanks for holding.
[03:14:02.157 --> 03:14:02.457]  Go ahead.
[03:14:03.597 --> 03:14:04.478]  Hey, Alex.
[03:14:04.618 --> 03:14:06.018]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:14:06.038 --> 03:14:06.379]  Thank you.
[03:14:06.739 --> 03:14:07.199]  Yes, I do.
[03:14:07.499 --> 03:14:08.199]  I do have a gift.
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:10.960]  I've got a domain for Paul.
[03:14:11.601 --> 03:14:15.862]  I secured it by shock.com.
[03:14:16.362 --> 03:14:17.823]  I wanted to give that to him.
[03:14:18.083 --> 03:14:18.683]  Say that again?
[03:14:18.723 --> 03:14:20.104]  You said redcoatcommander.com?
[03:14:21.252 --> 03:14:22.032]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.132 --> 03:14:25.313]  ImagineMyShock.com.
[03:14:25.553 --> 03:14:26.793]  Oh, that is a great name.
[03:14:26.893 --> 03:14:27.814]  He always says that.
[03:14:27.894 --> 03:14:28.494]  Yeah.
[03:14:28.634 --> 03:14:29.494]  Exactly.
[03:14:29.714 --> 03:14:30.194]  Exactly.
[03:14:30.594 --> 03:14:31.595]  We'll get your number.
[03:14:31.615 --> 03:14:33.735]  You want me to get you in touch with Paul?
[03:14:33.755 --> 03:14:33.975]  Yes.
[03:14:34.175 --> 03:14:34.975]  Yes, please.
[03:14:35.015 --> 03:14:36.816]  Give him that URL, though.
[03:14:36.836 --> 03:14:39.256]  You guys have to go to the little Swan Love Tunnel.
[03:14:40.377 --> 03:14:40.637]  Yes.
[03:14:40.797 --> 03:14:41.057]  Yes.
[03:14:41.077 --> 03:14:42.257]  Swan Love Tunnel.
[03:14:42.517 --> 03:14:44.378]  And then I've got a book idea for you, Alex.
[03:14:44.618 --> 03:14:44.918]  Okay.
[03:14:46.058 --> 03:14:46.358]  Okay.
[03:14:47.498 --> 03:14:49.879]  Produce a book called I Told You So.
[03:14:51.118 --> 03:15:02.548]  And with all the white papers and all the all your your the information that you have provided us with for many, many years.
[03:15:02.568 --> 03:15:05.511]  I mean, sometimes I wish you weren't right.
[03:15:05.711 --> 03:15:08.834]  You know, I I tell people, prove them wrong.
[03:15:09.034 --> 03:15:12.517]  Prove me wrong when I'm talking about this stuff, you know.
[03:15:12.657 --> 03:15:17.442]  And so if you produced a book, you know,
[03:15:18.209 --> 03:15:22.372]  Showing people, like you said, a lot of it is in white papers.
[03:15:22.392 --> 03:15:24.693]  A lot of it is public knowledge now.
[03:15:25.293 --> 03:15:26.134]  You're a genius.
[03:15:27.135 --> 03:15:27.975]  We're going to get your number.
[03:15:28.215 --> 03:15:34.039]  If you'd like to give Paul that, that'd be a great place for him to have his own blog or his own little personal statements, because we've got to all move off Facebook and Twitter.
[03:15:34.059 --> 03:15:35.160]  They're all censoring us.
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:37.061]  So imaginemyshock.com.
[03:15:37.441 --> 03:15:38.382]  Teresa, we'll put you on hold.
[03:15:38.442 --> 03:15:38.782]  Thank you.
[03:15:38.822 --> 03:15:39.342]  You're awesome.
[03:15:39.702 --> 03:15:41.784]  I'm sorry to Vincent, Nelson, Isaac, and Rafael.
[03:15:41.824 --> 03:15:42.604]  I tried to get the music going.
[03:15:42.944 --> 03:15:46.527]  But coming out of the gates is the great
[03:15:47.458 --> 03:15:59.115]  The amazing, the powerful filmmaker, Joe Super Patriot Gilbert!
[03:16:00.056 --> 03:16:01.298]  And then this Sunday, I'll be back.
[03:16:03.143 --> 03:16:09.790]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[03:16:10.471 --> 03:16:12.273]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[03:16:12.853 --> 03:16:18.720]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:21.763]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:22.023 --> 03:16:25.064]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:25.425 --> 03:16:31.327]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:31.987 --> 03:16:38.510]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:44.733]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:48.775]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:16:49.295 --> 03:16:57.481]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[03:16:57.882 --> 03:17:04.127]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:05.169 --> 03:17:09.593]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[03:17:10.233 --> 03:17:18.320]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[03:17:18.900 --> 03:17:20.562]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[03:17:21.102 --> 03:17:28.028]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this, because it is pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:28.088 --> 03:17:33.533]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[03:17:34.213 --> 03:17:46.322]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[03:17:46.443 --> 03:17:48.965]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[03:17:49.705 --> 03:17:58.070]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[03:17:58.090 --> 03:18:02.253]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[03:18:02.653 --> 03:18:07.376]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[03:18:07.956 --> 03:18:11.518]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[03:18:11.798 --> 03:18:15.681]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[03:18:16.261 --> 03:18:19.003]  So, we have a run of this, a limited run.
[03:18:19.023 --> 03:18:20.164]  We have a good supply right now.
[03:18:20.584 --> 03:18:21.945]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[03:18:22.385 --> 03:18:24.667]  But this may be the clincher.
[03:18:24.707 --> 03:18:27.929]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[03:18:28.369 --> 03:18:31.751]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[03:18:32.211 --> 03:18:34.353]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[03:18:34.693 --> 03:18:36.054]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[03:18:36.414 --> 03:18:43.779]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[03:18:44.079 --> 03:18:44.940]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:45.700]  Yeah.
[03:19:00.538 --> 03:19:01.058]  Pure iodine.
[03:19:01.439 --> 03:19:02.159]  Pure iodine.
[03:19:02.259 --> 03:19:06.402]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[03:19:06.723 --> 03:19:08.844]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[03:19:09.204 --> 03:19:10.465]  It's available exclusively.
[03:19:10.726 --> 03:19:14.669]  Survival Shield X2 at Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:14.749 --> 03:19:16.030]  And I hope, like a few years ago...
[03:19:17.122 --> 03:19:18.303]  That we can work this out.
[03:19:37.142 --> 03:19:37.923]  We're good to go.
[03:20:06.323 --> 03:20:09.045]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.110 --> 03:20:19.652]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:36.087 --> 03:20:40.852]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:44.696 --> 03:20:46.778]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:47.519 --> 03:20:50.502]  Joel Gilbert joining you for this final hour of the show.
[03:20:51.309 --> 03:20:55.391]  I want to talk about what's going on with the Democrats and the black community.
[03:20:55.911 --> 03:20:58.052]  This is the holy grail for the Democrats.
[03:20:58.152 --> 03:21:09.557]  They rely on 90% of the black vote, typically coming from urban areas, in order to send people to Congress and in order to support their national candidates.
[03:21:10.537 --> 03:21:15.159]  This week we saw Kanye West came out with tweets supporting President Trump.
[03:21:16.030 --> 03:21:21.612]  He specifically said Barack Obama did nothing for blacks, that things got worse under Obama.
[03:21:22.533 --> 03:21:25.614]  And he said, I refuse to be enslaved by monolithic thought.
[03:21:26.314 --> 03:21:38.699]  And he even shared a text message from his buddy John Legend, who was probably horrified that Kanye went ahead and shared his actual text on Twitter.
[03:21:39.463 --> 03:21:45.506]  Where John Legend said, hey, you know, you're you're you're risking your your legacy and all your fans.
[03:21:46.247 --> 03:21:54.071]  And Twitter suddenly dropped Kanye West's followers by nine million within like an hour.
[03:21:54.452 --> 03:21:55.532]  And then they had to restore it.
[03:21:55.572 --> 03:22:00.355]  Some clown over at Twitter probably got rid of a lot of his followers that had to put him back.
[03:22:01.474 --> 03:22:03.915]  And we had Kanye West standing his ground.
[03:22:04.335 --> 03:22:06.675]  He said, no, I refuse to be enslaved.
[03:22:06.996 --> 03:22:08.236]  I refuse to be enslaved.
[03:22:08.736 --> 03:22:09.916]  I can like Donald Trump.
[03:22:11.037 --> 03:22:16.258]  We had Chance the Rapper chimed in and said, blacks don't have to be Democrats.
[03:22:16.958 --> 03:22:20.819]  And this all started because of Candace Owen from Turning Point USA.
[03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:29.222]  She's the one that spoke at an event and said things like, you know, Democrats own the body of black people during slavery.
[03:22:29.262 --> 03:22:30.582]  Now they want to own my mind.
[03:22:31.460 --> 03:22:34.443]  And she said, they cannot own my mind anymore.
[03:22:34.984 --> 03:22:47.817]  So this issue terrifies Democrats because they rely on getting the black community to vote for them, despite the fact that they're working against their interests.
[03:22:48.498 --> 03:22:51.461]  Now, I made a movie called There's No Place Like Utopia a few years ago.
[03:22:52.316 --> 03:22:54.778]  And in that film, it was kind of like a Michael Moore film.
[03:22:54.818 --> 03:23:04.625]  If you haven't seen it, I'm running around the country to progressive cities like Chicago, Detroit, Newark, where Democrats have been in control for 50, 60 years.
[03:23:05.506 --> 03:23:16.815]  And they all have drug cultures, single motherhood, terrible education, taxes went higher, and they drove businesses out of the city.
[03:23:17.936 --> 03:23:20.357]  Yet the Democrats still have a hold on these people
[03:23:21.844 --> 03:23:22.965]  Voting for for them.
[03:23:23.445 --> 03:23:25.186]  So let's take a look at the trailer.
[03:23:25.246 --> 03:23:33.331]  Watch just about a minute of the trailer from There's No Place Like Utopia, and I'm going to talk more about the reactions of the people I talked to in the inner cities.
[03:23:33.391 --> 03:23:34.171]  Let's play the trailer.
[03:23:47.335 --> 03:23:48.776]  Oh, we're glad you landed at Oz.
[03:23:48.816 --> 03:23:49.657]  We've got a wizard here.
[03:23:49.677 --> 03:23:50.718]  He can solve your problems.
[03:23:51.078 --> 03:23:53.680]  Because... he's special!
[03:23:55.241 --> 03:23:56.842]  You can keep your doctor.
[03:23:56.882 --> 03:23:59.344]  You can keep your plan.
[03:23:59.364 --> 03:24:01.606]  People on welfare assistance here, mostly?
[03:24:01.966 --> 03:24:03.027]  That's a whole city.
[03:24:03.428 --> 03:24:09.953]  We're gonna replace capitalism with socialism.
[03:24:10.593 --> 03:24:12.735]  To remake the world as it should be.
[03:24:14.262 --> 03:24:14.783]  Utopia.
[03:24:15.243 --> 03:24:16.805]  It's the kingdom of heaven on earth.
[03:24:17.085 --> 03:24:18.026]  That's what they believe.
[03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:21.470]  Everything is boarded up.
[03:24:21.610 --> 03:24:24.653]  We're just getting poorer, honestly.
[03:24:24.833 --> 03:24:26.335]  There's no home left anymore.
[03:24:26.375 --> 03:24:27.756]  They're stuck in us.
[03:24:28.257 --> 03:24:30.119]  They never get home.
[03:24:30.612 --> 03:24:33.713]  Okay, that's the portion of the trailer I wanted you to see.
[03:24:34.233 --> 03:24:38.415]  Now, I'm going to take questions throughout the hour on this film, as well as some other films.
[03:24:39.196 --> 03:24:43.197]  Atomic Jihad, about the Iranian nuclear program, and also Dreams from My Real Father.
[03:24:43.777 --> 03:24:45.418]  If you want to call in, please call at 1-877-789-2539.
[03:24:45.438 --> 03:24:45.958]  That's 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:24:45.998 --> 03:24:46.158]  Now,
[03:24:55.822 --> 03:25:01.485]  You saw I talked to a lot of black folks in Chicago, and the first thing they said was, we don't want illegals.
[03:25:02.186 --> 03:25:04.727]  We don't want marijuana legalized.
[03:25:05.427 --> 03:25:08.949]  We don't want businesses being driven out of our communities because we want good jobs.
[03:25:09.430 --> 03:25:10.650]  We want lower taxes.
[03:25:11.231 --> 03:25:14.773]  We don't want our daughters using the public restroom with men.
[03:25:15.773 --> 03:25:16.774]  We want more police.
[03:25:18.355 --> 03:25:20.236]  Now these people sound like conservatives.
[03:25:21.476 --> 03:25:24.098]  Especially black women are the greatest conservatives in the country.
[03:25:24.750 --> 03:25:27.851]  And then you ask them, well, who'd you vote for?
[03:25:27.871 --> 03:25:29.012]  Are you going to vote Republican?
[03:25:29.392 --> 03:25:30.693]  They say, no, we vote Democrat.
[03:25:31.433 --> 03:25:36.295]  And I said, but look, everything you believe in is not what the Democrats believe in.
[03:25:36.335 --> 03:25:41.577]  They've created these drug cultures, violent community, everybody's on welfare, nothing got better.
[03:25:41.597 --> 03:25:43.998]  Just like Kanye West said, nothing got better under Obama.
[03:25:44.879 --> 03:25:49.621]  So the first thing they start to say is, well, you know, wait a minute, they start to rethink
[03:25:50.376 --> 03:25:50.677]  I don't know.
[03:26:12.876 --> 03:26:14.096]  So let's take our first caller.
[03:26:14.116 --> 03:26:25.080]  We want to talk a little bit about Kanye West and the very dangerous movement that seems to be starting for the Democrat Party if they lose their hold on the black vote.
[03:26:25.100 --> 03:26:26.240]  Can we bring up the first caller?
[03:26:31.382 --> 03:26:32.202]  Isaac, go ahead.
[03:26:33.063 --> 03:26:33.823]  Hi Isaac, go ahead.
[03:26:33.863 --> 03:26:34.603]  I apologize.
[03:26:34.863 --> 03:26:39.965]  I haven't seen your video Utopia yet, but my family settled in
[03:26:40.816 --> 03:26:44.037]  Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1840, and they left Denmark.
[03:26:44.537 --> 03:27:10.465]  And I was doing some research on them, and following my family's origin, and I found out, in Germany, in 1840, they really expelled a lot of liberal thinkers, and there was a group called the Durnstadt Forty, who settled, who left Gottensburg College, I'm probably pronouncing a lot of German wrong, but they came all the way to Texas,
[03:27:11.417 --> 03:27:13.137]  To do a thought experiment.
[03:27:13.677 --> 03:27:14.578]  And there was 40 of them.
[03:27:14.598 --> 03:27:15.558]  They called them the DERMSTAT-40.
[03:27:15.718 --> 03:27:18.478]  And they wanted to build a utopia in the middle of Texas.
[03:27:19.438 --> 03:27:21.959]  And they thought they had no rules, no law.
[03:27:22.699 --> 03:27:24.639]  It was a disaster within two years.
[03:27:25.220 --> 03:27:26.160]  They all dispersed.
[03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:27.260]  Some of them went back home.
[03:27:27.700 --> 03:27:33.841]  But the origins of this DERMSTAT-40 goes all the way to Christian Oersted.
[03:27:34.561 --> 03:27:38.742]  He had created some of the first electronic...
[03:27:39.730 --> 03:27:40.791]  Right, thank you for the call.
[03:27:40.831 --> 03:27:43.133]  I'm going to comment because we don't have that much time in the segment.
[03:27:43.834 --> 03:27:45.376]  Look, it's been tried many times.
[03:27:45.736 --> 03:27:57.588]  Thomas More, Marx's Worker's Paradise, Stalinism, Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung, everywhere they tried to create this perfect world with a paradise on earth, it always failed.
[03:27:58.008 --> 03:28:02.473]  And that's the difference between conservatives and liberals and leftists.
[03:28:03.553 --> 03:28:13.339]  Leftist, socialist, communist, they look at America and compare it to the perfect society, the perfect world, and they conclude, okay, we have to tear it down and destroy it because it's not perfect.
[03:28:14.173 --> 03:28:18.615]  Conservatives compare America to the rest of the world, and we say we love America, we want to build it up.
[03:28:19.636 --> 03:28:20.656]  That's the basic difference.
[03:28:21.096 --> 03:28:29.260]  And the Democrats are putting black people and minorities out in the front and saying, look, they don't have a perfect world.
[03:28:29.560 --> 03:28:37.264]  They don't have all these services and things that everybody else has, so we have to take down and start the system all over again.
[03:28:37.644 --> 03:28:41.566]  And I think black people are catching on that the Democrats have never had their interest at heart
[03:28:42.307 --> 03:28:45.911]  They're only looking to use them to further an agenda to take power.
[03:28:46.352 --> 03:28:49.376]  And that's what Barack Obama did when he was in office.
[03:28:49.436 --> 03:28:50.177]  Nothing got better.
[03:28:50.577 --> 03:28:57.045]  We're going to talk about Chicago and Obama and how that evolved right when we come back from the break.
[03:28:57.446 --> 03:28:58.187]  This is InfoWars.
[03:29:02.125 --> 03:29:05.988]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:29:06.549 --> 03:29:13.955]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:29:14.656 --> 03:29:19.359]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:29:19.960 --> 03:29:21.882]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:29:22.502 --> 03:29:25.925]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:29:26.726 --> 03:29:29.188]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:29:29.868 --> 03:29:36.512]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:29:37.132 --> 03:29:44.356]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:29:45.217 --> 03:29:51.881]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:29:52.441 --> 03:29:53.521]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:29:53.902 --> 03:29:55.723]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[03:29:56.523 --> 03:29:59.505]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[03:30:00.026 --> 03:30:01.747]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:17.688 --> 03:30:23.636]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:30:24.317 --> 03:30:27.841]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:30:28.717 --> 03:30:36.739]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:30:37.299 --> 03:30:45.001]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[03:30:45.782 --> 03:30:49.543]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[03:30:50.123 --> 03:30:54.064]  It's Alpha Power and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[03:30:55.175 --> 03:31:10.023]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[03:31:10.443 --> 03:31:15.786]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[03:31:16.106 --> 03:31:17.647]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[03:31:17.947 --> 03:31:19.288]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[03:31:19.308 --> 03:31:23.892]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower, because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[03:31:24.432 --> 03:31:28.755]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[03:31:28.775 --> 03:31:30.096]  I'm going to explain this, because this is critical.
[03:31:30.937 --> 03:31:37.141]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[03:31:37.542 --> 03:31:39.603]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[03:31:40.184 --> 03:31:41.745]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[03:31:41.765 --> 03:31:43.126]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[03:31:43.206 --> 03:31:44.607]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[03:31:47.509 --> 03:31:48.350]  But here's an example.
[03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:56.776]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:31:56.796 --> 03:31:58.517]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:31:58.977 --> 03:32:05.142]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[03:32:05.842 --> 03:32:10.925]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:32:11.205 --> 03:32:19.549]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:20.970]  Nobody else does that.
[03:32:21.050 --> 03:32:23.712]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:32:24.252 --> 03:32:40.389]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[03:32:40.789 --> 03:32:49.756]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[03:32:50.116 --> 03:32:52.138]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:32:52.518 --> 03:32:57.943]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[03:32:57.963 --> 03:32:58.263]  A total 360 win.
[03:32:58.483 --> 03:32:59.884]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.062 --> 03:33:24.983]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.383 --> 03:33:26.604]  Joel Gilbert back with you.
[03:33:26.644 --> 03:33:29.885]  We're talking about this phenomena this week.
[03:33:30.205 --> 03:33:32.986]  Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, Candace Owens.
[03:33:33.666 --> 03:33:45.591]  This may be the week that the black community starts to take a hard look at the Democrats and how they've abandoned them and used them over the years for their votes while doing absolutely nothing for them, including Barack Obama.
[03:33:46.351 --> 03:33:50.593]  We saw during the last election, I made the film called Banished the
[03:33:51.485 --> 03:34:01.353]  Untold story of Danny Williams, Bill Clinton's black son living in Arkansas, whose aunt took him to the governor's mansion when he was five years old, had the door slammed in his face.
[03:34:02.594 --> 03:34:05.236]  And they didn't care about Danny Williams.
[03:34:05.296 --> 03:34:07.738]  Guess who else didn't care about Danny Williams?
[03:34:07.798 --> 03:34:08.699]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:34:08.779 --> 03:34:10.360]  Black Lives Matter made fun of him.
[03:34:11.021 --> 03:34:12.242]  They didn't even contact him.
[03:34:12.282 --> 03:34:19.988]  They just tried to make fun of him and dismiss him because they had an agenda to support the Democrats, not an agenda to help black people.
[03:34:20.748 --> 03:34:34.438]  We're going to be talking more about this monumental week for the black community where the tide may be turning and the Democrats are living in terror right now that black people might start to re-examine their blind faith in the Democrat Party.
[03:34:35.258 --> 03:34:36.379]  You can call in at 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:34:36.419 --> 03:34:36.840]  That's 1-877-789-2539.
[03:34:36.860 --> 03:34:40.082]  Now, most of you have seen my film Dreams to My Real Father and
[03:34:50.678 --> 03:34:56.822]  Obama's story is typical of what the black community has suffered from, from liberals and communists.
[03:34:57.643 --> 03:35:02.206]  Barack Obama's real father, as I showed in my film, was not the Kenyan goat herder.
[03:35:02.726 --> 03:35:14.254]  It was a Russian agent named Frank Marshall Davis, who was in Chicago, who the white communists got to help try to bring black people into the communist movement in the 30s.
[03:35:14.695 --> 03:35:17.957]  Let's take a quick look at part of the trailer for Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:35:27.062 --> 03:35:31.788]  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya.
[03:35:32.429 --> 03:35:33.510]  He grew up herding goats.
[03:35:39.538 --> 03:35:41.140]  Frank Marshall Davis, writer.
[03:35:56.593 --> 03:36:11.324]  Okay, just wanted you to be reminded of this trailer because Obama's father, Frank Marshall Davis, was recruited into the Communist Party by white communists to help convince black people in Chicago to join the communist movement in the 30s.
[03:36:12.065 --> 03:36:13.206]  Black people were no fools.
[03:36:13.266 --> 03:36:22.813]  They were religious, church-going people, hard-working, strong families, and they rejected Frank Marshall Davis and the communism he represented because it was atheist.
[03:36:23.794 --> 03:36:26.276]  Davis later went to Hawaii on orders of the Kremlin
[03:36:27.535 --> 03:36:32.999]  His son, Barack Obama, he raises Barack Obama by Obama's own admission.
[03:36:33.739 --> 03:36:37.882]  And Frank Marshall Davis radicalizes Obama into this Marxist worldview.
[03:36:38.582 --> 03:36:41.464]  Obama ends up back in Chicago, where his father is from.
[03:36:42.265 --> 03:36:43.346]  And the same thing happens.
[03:36:43.386 --> 03:36:49.310]  The white communists recruit Obama to try to trick black people into joining the socialist movement.
[03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:52.672]  But 50 years later, black people in Chicago are no fools.
[03:36:53.132 --> 03:36:54.253]  They rejected Obama.
[03:36:54.293 --> 03:36:55.294]  He ran for Congress.
[03:36:55.554 --> 03:36:56.394]  They didn't vote for him.
[03:36:56.434 --> 03:36:57.255]  Bobby Rush won.
[03:36:58.449 --> 03:37:03.751]  It was only the white liberals that supported Obama and pushed him into the national spotlight.
[03:37:04.571 --> 03:37:06.912]  Let's take a call from Georgian, Texas.
[03:37:07.652 --> 03:37:14.954]  Go ahead with your question about any of my films or the way that the Democrats have been using the black community for years and years.
[03:37:16.254 --> 03:37:18.715]  You know, I have all three of your films.
[03:37:19.315 --> 03:37:20.956]  Dreams of My Real Father.
[03:37:21.496 --> 03:37:25.317]  You know, there's no place like Utopia and The Art of Insult.
[03:37:25.970 --> 03:37:42.277]  But you know, one thing, I lived in Florida and I'd seen a lot of Cubans and they told me all about Castro and how communism has destroyed the human dignity, the human spirit.
[03:37:42.417 --> 03:37:50.660]  If you want to really see communism in its graphic form, you go on YouTube and go look up the movie The Czechist that was made in 1992 in Russia.
[03:37:52.904 --> 03:37:58.967]  If you want to see graphic communism, how it destroys the human spirit, go see that movie, The Chequettes.
[03:37:59.988 --> 03:38:09.913]  But as far as like, you know, as far as like black America, you know, I've seen how, you know, the great society and the socialist program have destroyed the black family.
[03:38:10.393 --> 03:38:17.897]  I remember one time, I'm 51 years old, that black Americans used to be the most righteous, upright people.
[03:38:18.718 --> 03:38:20.559]  Now you can't really find them anymore.
[03:38:22.136 --> 03:38:23.396]  Well, let me comment.
[03:38:23.416 --> 03:38:24.077]  Thanks for your call.
[03:38:25.217 --> 03:38:28.558]  Look, black people are very righteous.
[03:38:28.598 --> 03:38:30.038]  They're very family-oriented.
[03:38:30.939 --> 03:38:33.019]  They're very close-knit families.
[03:38:33.519 --> 03:38:46.163]  I think it's actually hard to find a black child to adopt because the grandparents or the parents of the child or the grandparents will raise that child because they're so close-knit people.
[03:38:47.021 --> 03:38:55.404]  If you saw my film, There's No Place Like Utopia, I talked to a lot of black people all over, and a lot of them are on welfare, and they're very unhappy about it.
[03:38:55.884 --> 03:38:56.805]  They're very unhappy about it.
[03:38:56.825 --> 03:38:57.805]  They don't want to be on welfare.
[03:38:57.845 --> 03:38:59.866]  They don't want to be on these assistance programs.
[03:39:00.526 --> 03:39:01.406]  It's embarrassing.
[03:39:01.947 --> 03:39:05.328]  And that's why Trump has made such inroads
[03:39:05.985 --> 03:39:09.748]  Because he's got the lowest black unemployment in history.
[03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:14.132]  And he even announced that to the in the State of the Union address.
[03:39:14.572 --> 03:39:17.014]  And guess who wouldn't even clap or even stand up?
[03:39:17.595 --> 03:39:18.736]  Was the Black Caucus.
[03:39:19.196 --> 03:39:30.645]  These black people that have been coerced into the Democrat Party that just follow that line and are not looking after the interests of the black community who probably voted them into power.
[03:39:31.026 --> 03:39:33.027]  Let's take another call from from Jim.
[03:39:33.107 --> 03:39:33.688]  Go ahead, Jim.
[03:39:38.655 --> 03:39:39.535]  Okay, Jim, are you there?
[03:39:42.616 --> 03:39:46.137]  Okay, looks like we don't... Is it Jim in Virginia, or who is it?
[03:39:47.838 --> 03:39:49.458]  Let's go with Alexander in Virginia instead.
[03:39:49.498 --> 03:39:50.338]  Go ahead, Alexander.
[03:39:51.058 --> 03:40:07.263]  Yes, this is Jim, but I would like to suggest that maybe a focus of breaking the Democratic hold on the black vote should be going into that past with Jim Crow, the reversal of Reconstruction.
[03:40:08.021 --> 03:40:08.942]  The KKK.
[03:40:09.902 --> 03:40:10.603]  All this stuff.
[03:40:10.983 --> 03:40:23.452]  But now, the Democrats are getting away with the illusion or the myth that they and the Republicans switched in the past, and so all that actually happened from the Republican Party.
[03:40:25.093 --> 03:40:27.214]  And that's what I hear from people.
[03:40:27.234 --> 03:40:32.778]  They are convinced that all those things in the past was the result of Republicans.
[03:40:34.486 --> 03:40:40.031]  Right, that's what a lot of, thank you for the call, a lot of them will say, well things have flipped, things have changed around.
[03:40:40.091 --> 03:40:57.286]  Now the Democrats represent our interests, but now you've got admired black cultural figures like Kanye West, I mean who's bigger than him, that are openly questioning why black communities should just give away their votes to the Democrats.
[03:40:57.346 --> 03:40:59.348]  It really hasn't done anything for them.
[03:41:00.661 --> 03:41:04.002]  We saw Chance the Rapper came right away and said you don't have to be a Democrat.
[03:41:04.502 --> 03:41:20.327]  So this is the biggest nightmare of the Democrat Party because if they lose, let's say the black vote is 20% and even bigger in Democrat primaries of course, if it's 20% and they lose 10% of it, the Democrat Party is finished.
[03:41:21.848 --> 03:41:26.529]  But the trick that the Democrats have done with Barack Obama is to try to get
[03:41:27.159 --> 03:41:36.509]  Black leaders to join the Democrat Party and trick black people into thinking, well, well, here's a black guy and he's going to look out for my interests.
[03:41:36.869 --> 03:41:38.892]  Barack Obama didn't do anything for the black community.
[03:41:38.912 --> 03:41:39.973]  He did a lot for Iran.
[03:41:40.891 --> 03:41:41.931]  He did a lot for Russia.
[03:41:41.971 --> 03:41:43.531]  He was very pro-Russia in his first term.
[03:41:44.172 --> 03:41:45.332]  He did a lot for illegals.
[03:41:45.392 --> 03:41:46.592]  He did a lot for Hondurans.
[03:41:46.912 --> 03:41:48.272]  He did a lot for Mexicans.
[03:41:49.513 --> 03:41:50.733]  He didn't do anything for black people.
[03:41:50.753 --> 03:41:59.234]  And I think they realize it now that just because someone has the same race as them doesn't mean they're going to look out for their interests.
[03:41:59.674 --> 03:42:07.896]  I think Donald Trump, a white guy, has done a lot more to achieve employment goals and all the agenda that
[03:42:09.443 --> 03:42:11.964]  That the Democrats have been promising for years and years.
[03:42:12.884 --> 03:42:18.346]  Education is going to get better, schools, reduce the violence, get rid of the violent gangs, and so on.
[03:42:18.906 --> 03:42:34.050]  So it's a monumental week because this really is the tipping point, I think, where if you have Kanye West saying, you don't have to be a Democrat and Chance the Rapper, and John Legend come and says, no, Hillary Clinton's, you know, he put on rallies for Hillary Clinton.
[03:42:34.090 --> 03:42:36.211]  John Legend comes and says, no, you can't do that.
[03:42:36.811 --> 03:42:38.952]  And Kanye West said, well, yes, I can.
[03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:45.554]  So, keep a close eye on this debate in the black community with the Democrats.
[03:42:45.775 --> 03:42:49.037]  I think the stranglehold is beginning to be broken.
[03:42:49.718 --> 03:42:55.942]  When we come back, we're going to come back with Larry Klayman to talk about the Senate committee trying to protect the Mueller probe.
[03:42:55.962 --> 03:42:56.543]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:03.675 --> 03:43:07.559]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top scientists and see what they say.
[03:43:08.380 --> 03:43:23.076]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders, a lot of the behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach.
[03:43:24.416 --> 03:43:28.219]  That then create major toxicity in the gut, causing toxicity in the brain.
[03:43:28.279 --> 03:43:30.260]  Here's a big BBC report today.
[03:43:30.380 --> 03:43:32.562]  How bacteria are changing your mood.
[03:43:32.582 --> 03:43:34.423]  If you have the wrong ones, you're depressed.
[03:43:34.623 --> 03:43:36.505]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months.

[03:46:10.814 --> 03:46:11.334]  Thanks for holding.
[03:46:11.734 --> 03:46:12.815]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:46:13.035 --> 03:46:13.655]  Hey, brother.
[03:46:13.955 --> 03:46:14.315]  Good, man.
[03:46:14.335 --> 03:46:15.135]  Thank you for calling.
[03:46:15.235 --> 03:46:15.795]  Hey, hey.
[03:46:15.875 --> 03:46:20.277]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:46:20.497 --> 03:46:26.858]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:46:26.878 --> 03:46:28.699]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:46:28.799 --> 03:46:35.641]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:46:36.221 --> 03:46:37.222]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:46:37.282 --> 03:46:41.283]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:46:41.684 --> 03:46:43.284]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:46:43.724 --> 03:46:44.485]  And exactly.
[03:46:44.505 --> 03:46:48.727]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:46:49.087 --> 03:46:49.367]  Boom!
[03:46:49.487 --> 03:46:52.328]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:46:52.388 --> 03:46:52.909]  It's amazing.
[03:46:52.969 --> 03:46:57.211]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:47:05.723 --> 03:47:11.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.010 --> 03:47:18.191]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:18.711 --> 03:47:23.935]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:47:29.559 --> 03:47:31.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:32.455 --> 03:47:33.076]  Welcome back.
[03:47:33.156 --> 03:47:34.056]  I'm Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:34.577 --> 03:47:36.018]  We've got one more segment for you.
[03:47:36.058 --> 03:47:40.381]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones Store for Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:47:40.901 --> 03:47:42.062]  Buy it in Alex Jones Store.
[03:47:42.082 --> 03:47:51.729]  You'll laugh for 95 minutes and you'll get to understand Trump for the very first time, the marketing and branding genius that he is and that he's continuing today.
[03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:57.694]  So much so that Little Rocket Man is giving up his nuclear weapons and laying down his arms.
[03:47:58.114 --> 03:48:01.677]  So Trump, victory after victory, it's a whole lot of winning.
[03:48:02.558 --> 03:48:07.060]  Let's take one more call on the Kanye West phenomena from Marty in Boston.
[03:48:07.601 --> 03:48:08.261]  Marty, go ahead.
[03:48:08.281 --> 03:48:11.262]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:11.362 --> 03:48:20.567]  So, you know, my father has been working in the entertainment industry for quite some time, and he actually had the pleasure of working with Kanye a few years back.
[03:48:21.027 --> 03:48:27.030]  And the things that he learned from Kanye I see playing out in front of us right now.
[03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:29.371]  One of those things being that
[03:48:30.074 --> 03:48:37.799]  Kanye West is, he's taking the leap forward and he's leading a lot of the black community.
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:39.701]  Now my name is Millennial Matt.
[03:48:39.901 --> 03:48:42.182]  Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger.
[03:48:43.103 --> 03:48:44.764]  No, no, okay.
[03:48:45.104 --> 03:48:45.865]  Sorry about that folks.
[03:48:46.645 --> 03:48:49.007]  Kanye West really is a leader.
[03:48:49.547 --> 03:48:54.871]  He's shown that he'll go against the grain and he'll speak his mind and I think a lot of people
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:49:01.224]  Have a lot to be proud of that are listening to him and are willing to hear what he has to say.
[03:49:01.584 --> 03:49:09.849]  And obviously, he didn't appreciate his buddy John Legend telling him, you know, the thought police telling him, no, you've got to go with Hillary like like I've done my whole life.
[03:49:10.430 --> 03:49:14.572]  We're going to switch gears here to talk to Larry Klayman.
[03:49:14.672 --> 03:49:18.835]  We had a great interview a couple of weeks back, 120,000 views on YouTube.
[03:49:19.776 --> 03:49:21.937]  And we'd like to hear from Larry.
[03:49:21.957 --> 03:49:22.557]  Are you there, Larry?
[03:49:23.518 --> 03:49:24.078]  Oh, I'm here.
[03:49:24.378 --> 03:49:24.999]  Great to see you.
[03:49:25.740 --> 03:49:26.340]  Great to see you.
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:31.442]  Well, look, the Senate Judiciary Committee just approved legislation.
[03:49:31.482 --> 03:49:36.744]  That's why I wanted to have you back on today to protect the Mueller probe so that Robert Mueller can't be fired.
[03:49:37.564 --> 03:49:38.845]  What is playing out now?
[03:49:39.065 --> 03:49:44.547]  Are we at the end game where they're just trying to save Mueller so he can keep persecuting Trump?
[03:49:45.027 --> 03:49:46.968]  And what can and should Trump do to fight back?
[03:49:48.248 --> 03:49:54.270]  Joel, the reality is, and we've seen this all along, is that it's not just the Democrat establishment in Washington, D.C.
[03:49:54.330 --> 03:49:55.730]  It's the Republican establishment.
[03:49:55.770 --> 03:50:00.972]  They want to see President Trump dead politically, and in some cases, actually, it's unbelievable.
[03:50:01.032 --> 03:50:01.752]  It's outrageous.
[03:50:02.432 --> 03:50:03.792]  This is Senator Charles Grassley.
[03:50:03.812 --> 03:50:05.113]  He's the chairman of that committee.
[03:50:05.973 --> 03:50:07.493]  I've dealt with him in the last few years.
[03:50:07.553 --> 03:50:11.254]  I tried to bring mass surveillance to his attention, and he didn't listen to me.
[03:50:11.294 --> 03:50:12.735]  I don't think he understood what I was saying.
[03:50:12.755 --> 03:50:16.856]  I think, frankly, not only is he an establishment, but he's become senile and old age.
[03:50:17.648 --> 03:50:21.873]  But you've got this very evil establishment that wants to destroy the president.
[03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:27.250]  And that, of course, explains why Jeff Sessions is left alone at the Justice Department to do nothing.
[03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:33.032]  This week he says he's not doing anything because special counsels take on life of their own.
[03:50:33.112 --> 03:50:40.973]  Well, yes, if I was special counsel and you go to our website at freedomwatchusa.org, you can be damn sure I would take on a life of our own.
[03:50:41.494 --> 03:50:44.914]  I would prosecute elite criminals on behalf of the American people.
[03:50:44.974 --> 03:50:47.615]  Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Robert Mueller,
[03:50:48.419 --> 03:50:51.021]  Barack Obama, George Soros, the rest of them.
[03:50:51.461 --> 03:50:57.865]  But this establishment doesn't want to rock the boat, and Trump rocks the boat, because he challenges their money train and their power.
[03:50:58.646 --> 03:51:00.827]  And that's why we, the American people, need to rise up.
[03:51:01.188 --> 03:51:03.129]  That's why I need to be named special counsel.
[03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:07.472]  And I also think that we should be starting citizens' grand juries, which are totally legal.
[03:51:08.032 --> 03:51:12.055]  Justice Scalia found in 1992 in a case, United States v. Williams,
[03:51:12.702 --> 03:51:17.104]  That the grand jury belongs to the American people, not to the other three branches of government.
[03:51:17.365 --> 03:51:22.968]  We have the right to impanel a grand jury, to indict, to try, and to convict.
[03:51:23.168 --> 03:51:25.589]  And also, we have the right to sentence and enforce that.
[03:51:26.069 --> 03:51:29.651]  And I would go to a federal judge through a citizen's grand jury.
[03:51:29.671 --> 03:51:33.393]  Again, you can see that on our website at freedomwatchusa.org.
[03:51:33.914 --> 03:51:36.615]  And I would seek to enforce the convictions.
[03:51:37.235 --> 03:51:37.916]  We need your help.
[03:51:37.956 --> 03:51:39.677]  We need the American people's help here.
[03:51:40.519 --> 03:51:42.640]  Yeah, you can go to FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[03:51:42.660 --> 03:51:43.620]  So Larry, how does this work?
[03:51:43.660 --> 03:51:49.602]  Can you come to Texas, come to Dallas, and choose citizens and set up a grand jury?
[03:51:49.642 --> 03:51:50.522]  How would that work?
[03:51:50.982 --> 03:51:52.523]  And how would you impanel people?
[03:51:53.123 --> 03:51:55.643]  And how would you get testimony?
[03:51:55.703 --> 03:51:56.704]  What would happen in the end?
[03:51:57.024 --> 03:51:57.844]  Explain the process.
[03:51:57.864 --> 03:52:03.606]  Yes, and we need resources to do that so people can donate to our cause by going to FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[03:52:03.646 --> 03:52:07.687]  But I am a member of the Northern District of Texas District Court.
[03:52:08.588 --> 03:52:11.549]  We could do it in an Iran Info Wars down there.
[03:52:11.589 --> 03:52:15.410]  I would like to see them play a role here, too, so we can reach the American people.
[03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:25.193]  But yes, we can impanel a grand jury by going to neutral voter rolls and choose them randomly, exactly the way it's done by the Justice Department and judges.
[03:52:25.773 --> 03:52:29.954]  We would then choose a pettit jury once we got convictions.
[03:52:30.754 --> 03:52:33.175]  A regular jury, again, neutrally chosen.
[03:52:33.615 --> 03:52:35.696]  Get a retired judge that had some courage.
[03:52:35.756 --> 03:52:36.776]  I've got some in mind.
[03:52:37.583 --> 03:52:45.936]  And then we give notice to the defendants, such as Comey, Mueller, Clinton, and the rest, that they're willing to come and testify in front of that grand jury.
[03:52:46.597 --> 03:52:49.902]  And if they don't, we'll seek to indict them on the evidence we have.
[03:52:50.563 --> 03:52:51.364]  And then we'll try them.
[03:52:51.894 --> 03:53:00.077]  We'll try them before a neutral judge and a jury, and we will convict them, undoubtedly, because there's so much evidence out there.
[03:53:00.437 --> 03:53:02.297]  There's no way that we don't get convictions.
[03:53:02.437 --> 03:53:05.258]  Easier than convicting, I might say, Bill Cosby.
[03:53:05.738 --> 03:53:07.519]  So, this is what we have in plan.
[03:53:08.219 --> 03:53:09.900]  Yeah, what would happen with that conviction?
[03:53:09.960 --> 03:53:11.380]  Can you then enforce it?
[03:53:12.500 --> 03:53:13.181]  How do you enforce it?
[03:53:14.221 --> 03:53:19.083]  We, you know, technically speaking, the American people could enforce it themselves, like they did in the Old West.
[03:53:19.143 --> 03:53:20.283]  I wouldn't advocate that.
[03:53:21.027 --> 03:53:24.909]  But I do have a judge in mind who I believe would issue an order to the U.S.
[03:53:24.949 --> 03:53:29.590]  Marshal Service to arrest the criminals and throw them in federal prison.
[03:53:30.391 --> 03:53:35.453]  And we can certainly find, with all of the judges in this country, one judge that will do that.
[03:53:35.473 --> 03:53:39.374]  I have one particular judge in mind who I believe would do that.
[03:53:39.414 --> 03:53:40.355]  But we've got to try it.
[03:53:41.315 --> 03:53:45.657]  In addition to being special counsel, I wouldn't need a citizen's grand jury if I was appointed to that.
[03:53:46.317 --> 03:53:50.539]  But if that does not happen, and I don't believe that it will because President Trump's been
[03:53:51.500 --> 03:53:55.463]  Collared, I think, by his lawyers to take not very strong action here.
[03:53:56.464 --> 03:53:58.306]  We need to do the Citizen's Grand Jury.
[03:53:58.326 --> 03:54:01.348]  We need to do it quick because our country is sinking into the swamp.
[03:54:02.189 --> 03:54:03.150]  Alright, do you have faith?
[03:54:03.190 --> 03:54:06.452]  We've got this guy Huber as a prosecutor working with Sessions.
[03:54:06.492 --> 03:54:11.336]  You've got the Horowitz Report coming out in drips and the big part is probably coming in a couple of weeks.
[03:54:12.257 --> 03:54:18.482]  You've got this guy Cohen Watnick from the intelligence working with DOJ.
[03:54:19.182 --> 03:54:20.884]  Do you not have any confidence that
[03:54:21.582 --> 03:54:32.751]  The system that is slowly working behind the scenes will go ahead and come up with prosecutions, indictments, and carry out what a special counsel would have done anyway.
[03:54:32.972 --> 03:54:33.712]  And why not?
[03:54:34.433 --> 03:54:35.834]  Zero confidence, Joel.
[03:54:36.014 --> 03:54:39.217]  Look, we have the example of the last three decades.
[03:54:39.817 --> 03:54:42.419]  When has any of the elites in Washington, D.C.
[03:54:42.439 --> 03:54:44.061]  been held accountable for anything?
[03:54:44.773 --> 03:54:49.436]  What happens is the justice system burns the lower-level and middle-hanging fruit.
[03:54:49.556 --> 03:54:55.500]  People like Scooter Libby, who was Chief of Staff to Vice President Cheney in the Valerie Plame scandal.
[03:54:55.900 --> 03:54:56.640]  He got indicted.
[03:54:56.720 --> 03:54:57.841]  Cheney never got indicted.
[03:54:58.622 --> 03:55:00.143]  Karl Rove never got indicted.
[03:55:00.543 --> 03:55:01.503]  No one gets indicted.
[03:55:02.164 --> 03:55:04.085]  So we need a special counsel.
[03:55:04.105 --> 03:55:05.386]  That's why I should be appointed.
[03:55:05.996 --> 03:55:12.477]  You can go to our website, freedomwatchusa.org, and in addition we need a citizen's grand jury.
[03:55:12.937 --> 03:55:15.618]  Because we need to go after the high-hanging fruit.
[03:55:16.158 --> 03:55:19.979]  We need to go after Obama, after Clinton, after Mueller, after Comey.
[03:55:19.999 --> 03:55:22.299]  Look, Mueller has been leaking grand jury information.
[03:55:22.339 --> 03:55:23.000]  That's a crime.
[03:55:23.560 --> 03:55:25.840]  He should be taken out legally now for that.
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:29.421]  I have cases pending in that regard, but if I was special counsel,
[03:55:30.203 --> 03:55:37.027]  I would control a grand jury and have him indicted for that and convicted and thrown in prison.
[03:55:37.127 --> 03:55:45.052]  This guy is a crook, he's a criminal, he's dishonest, and the Republican establishment is backing him up because they want to see the president legally dead.
[03:55:45.713 --> 03:55:47.114]  And people need to understand that.
[03:55:48.134 --> 03:55:50.676]  Tell me this, do you think it's realistic that
[03:55:51.394 --> 03:55:56.438]  The people lower level of the FBI decided one day we don't like Donald Trump.
[03:55:56.478 --> 03:56:02.522]  Let's start this whole thing in motion and work with the DNC to try to spy on him and then get him out of office.
[03:56:03.063 --> 03:56:18.935]  Is that realistic or by definition did it come orders come from the White House from Valerie Jarrett from Obama just like with the IRS scandal where they use the IRS to interfere in the 2012 election so conservatives could not organize.
[03:56:19.773 --> 03:56:24.236]  Is this only originating in the FBI, or does it come from far above?
[03:56:24.936 --> 03:56:25.697]  It comes from the top.
[03:56:25.717 --> 03:56:30.559]  It comes from people who were in control of the FBI, Comey and Mueller, before that.
[03:56:30.579 --> 03:56:33.561]  It comes from the President of the United States, Barack Obama.
[03:56:33.601 --> 03:56:34.682]  Yes, it comes from him.
[03:56:34.702 --> 03:56:38.584]  You know, average FBI agents, special agents, I've represented them.
[03:56:39.004 --> 03:56:41.626]  They're generally very good, honest, patriotic people.
[03:56:42.296 --> 03:56:44.717]  If they want to stay in the FBI, they have to do what they're told.
[03:56:45.277 --> 03:56:46.457]  Many of them have quit.
[03:56:46.757 --> 03:56:55.459]  Many of them expressed complete consternation and disgust at what happened with regard to Hillary Clinton and covering up her email scandal and other scandals.
[03:56:55.839 --> 03:56:57.940]  It's the people at the top that are highly corrupt.
[03:56:58.340 --> 03:57:02.701]  And that's who we need to hold accountable, to set an example for everybody else.
[03:57:03.261 --> 03:57:08.102]  You know, we peasants, you know, if we commit a crime, we go to prison.
[03:57:08.182 --> 03:57:11.043]  But if you're a higher-up, you just walk off and continue to cash in.
[03:57:11.978 --> 03:57:13.279]  In and around Washington, D.C.
[03:57:13.319 --> 03:57:14.180]  and state capitals.
[03:57:14.801 --> 03:57:16.662]  And this is why this country's coming unglued.
[03:57:17.203 --> 03:57:20.566]  This is what we saw in the days leading up to the revolution which caused the revolution.
[03:57:20.986 --> 03:57:28.812]  King George III and his yes-men judges rubber-stamping the illegal acts that he was issuing by edict against the colonies.
[03:57:29.173 --> 03:57:31.455]  We are in a second American Revolution.
[03:57:31.795 --> 03:57:32.616]  Okay, very good, Larry.
[03:57:32.636 --> 03:57:33.797]  We've only got a few seconds left.
[03:57:33.877 --> 03:57:35.098]  I want to wrap it up.
