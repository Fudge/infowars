[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.174]  Beijing War on Corruption.
[00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:07.807]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:23.548]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:24.569]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.509]  It's the 28th day of January 2018.
[00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.470]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.952]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:38.312]  Central.
[00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:44.534]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to host the last two segments of the broadcast today because I want to give him the floor.
[00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:54.856]  You know, if I stay on with him, I'll have plenty to add about the phenomenon of QAnon that millions of people read on the 8chan message boards.
[00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:59.237]  And much of what QAnon has put out has turned out to be very accurate information.
[00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:07.961]  Some of it has not transpired exactly how QAnon said, but things are fluid and no one knows the future exactly.
[00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.442]  I know that we have some really high-level
[00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:30.286]  Military and intelligence agency sources that have been extremely accurate, in fact, more accurate even, and they're stunning, not just predictions, but exposing huge stories, like Zach, who we should get back on here very, very soon, who's laid out the secrets of the storm.
[00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:39.492]  There is a storm worldwide of nationalism against globalism, a storm of populism taking place.
[00:01:41.008 --> 00:02:01.183]  And the globalists, the insiders, the monopoly men, are in a full panic to stop it and to brand it as racist or evil or all the rest of it because they are the people using race, they are the people using region, they are the people dumbing down the population and playing people off against each other.
[00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:08.269]  And so Corsi will be on in the last two segments of today's transmission.
[00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:27.083]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to basically parallel World War II and some of the factors and some of the factions that the United States, Russia, and England faced.
[00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.395]  Versus the factions that you'll find the very same alliances face yet again.
[00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.418]  Because history does repeat, but it's been said it also rhymes.
[00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:38.799]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:46.586]  And what spurred me to think about this was, I was invited to speak a few years ago at the Oxford Union.
[00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:50.269]  And then I was invited to speak at Cambridge as well.
[00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:53.014]  But I refused.
[00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:58.618]  I was in the middle of a contentious divorce with my first wife and a custody battle at the time, so I didn't do that.
[00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.660]  But Roger Stone's going to speak there.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:17.353]  And we were talking last night about what he was going to talk about and just the parallels of what he was going to talk about versus what we talk about here and what I was going to talk about are basically the same because we're looking at the same thing.
[00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:20.015]  But it really struck me
[00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:23.669]  How really black and white the issues are here.
[00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.154]  And really how authoritarian and truly evil.
[00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:39.166]  The Globalist Star, but we'll have cameras there covering that because the Oxford Union, and speaking of the faculty, that's where Gandhi and Martin Luther King and Kennedy and everybody else has spoken.
[00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:41.348]  It's one of the most prestigious places to speak.
[00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.331]  And I didn't refuse it to snub them.
[00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.253]  I was just hunkered down here.
[00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.596]  But I'm glad that Roger's going over there to do that.
[00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:50.917]  The invitation's open.
[00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:52.879]  I'll probably go do that sometime as well.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:07.087]  Why not just give you kind of a little foretaste of what I intend, when I speak someplace like Oxford, to say here on air?
[00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:13.291]  Because it has an anglophilic vein through it.
[00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:16.073]  It's a particular speech I would give in England.
[00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:20.707]  But then I was thinking about that speech that I would give in England that I never gave because I didn't go.
[00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:25.390]  And I was thinking about, well, why not just give that speech here today?
[00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.271]  So I never wrote the speech.
[00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:28.011]  It's in my head.
[00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:32.334]  But you're going to get that speech coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:37.219]  I'm even thinking about putting a lectern in, in an area here in one of our new studios, where I can go give speeches.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:52.736]  Just think about being in a lectern, and maybe even have a studio audience in sometimes, and to do that, because as folks know, I haven't given a lot of speeches in years, but I did previously, and folks, that's particularly where I shine, is to a large group or audience.
[00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:54.038]  We'll be back, stay with us.

[00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:28.132]  We're gonna be here for the next two hours.
[00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:29.813]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:32.555]  This is the live Sunday transmission.
[00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:33.816]  I've been doing this for 10 years.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.281]  10 years here in the Sunday slot, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:37.662 --> 00:06:40.484]  Then, of course, the weekday transmission, 11 a.m.
[00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:41.284]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:41.704]  Central.
[00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:43.586]  Been doing that for 20 years.
[00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.547]  I've been on air for 23 years.
[00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:49.890]  It'll be 23 years coming up in April.
[00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:52.111]  Wow!
[00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:52.912]  Where to start?
[00:06:54.773 --> 00:07:00.997]  When you're embedded in the news and you really pay attention to what's going on and you actually know the facts versus
[00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:07.467]  What the mainstream corporate media is saying, and you see their talking points, it's really frustrating.
[00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:12.730]  And I know most Americans have caught the lies, the propaganda, the twisting for themselves.
[00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.753]  But so much of the real brainwashing goes on inside entertainment.
[00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:30.000]  And have you ever asked why the so-called left, really the modern authoritarians, posing as liberals, are so willing to censor the internet now, and so willing to try to shut down everybody's free speech with their own?
[00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:35.204]  It's because it's what the modern left has done the last hundred years all over the world.
[00:07:35.224 --> 00:07:36.545]  They always shut down free speech.
[00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:38.506]  Look at Venezuela and it's collapsed right now.
[00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.167]  Look at so many other leftist countries.
[00:07:40.187 --> 00:07:46.092]  They always end in barbarous, cutthroat, freebooting, road warrior-like collapse.
[00:07:48.373 --> 00:08:00.542]  But particularly, we've seen the bullying in Hollywood, the bullying in mainline newspapers, the bullying in mainline TV, where anybody
[00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:10.318]  Who is even mildly nationalistic, mildly free market, gets attacked, gets demonized, doesn't get booked on shows, doesn't get written about.
[00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:13.701]  They try to publish their books, and the publishers dump them.
[00:08:14.442 --> 00:08:15.062]  Like Milo.
[00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:26.193]  They learn that Neil Strauss, one of the top writers, wants to publish a big book with me, and they found out about the secret.
[00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:36.804]  Shopping of the book, and CNN came out and said, we've absolutely got to, you know, shut this down, not let Alex Jones publish this book.
[00:08:36.844 --> 00:08:37.565]  They're incredible.
[00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:50.534]  And so you see Jay-Z, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, coming out complaining about Trump, saying he's a racist with no evidence of it, when it's Jay-Z being the racist.
[00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:55.578]  And Trump responds back, hey, we've got the lowest black unemployment ever.
[00:08:56.459 --> 00:09:08.433]  I am directly meeting with black leaders across the Rust Belt to get massive investment targeted into those neighborhoods with incentives for high paying training and jobs.
[00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:10.596]  I mean, we're talking about
[00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:19.269]  Starting $50,000 a year, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $100,000 a year with chances into management, which isn't like affirmative action.
[00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:28.256]  Pay somebody to sit at home and watch TV and have kids that then get involved in drugs and crime and create a cycle of prisons and poverty, which they admit is going on.
[00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:29.797]  This is the real deal.
[00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:31.578]  This is direct investment.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.864]  And you see the so-called black leaders, which are a bunch of hip-hop stars and people like that.
[00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:41.383]  Out there race baiting.
[00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:42.664]  It's truly sickening.
[00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:44.165]  And then Michael Moore lays in.
[00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:49.128]  And it's crazy to see how upset they are that all of this is happening.
[00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:49.448]  Here it is.
[00:09:49.869 --> 00:09:52.530]  Unhinged Michael Moore assails Trump.
[00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:54.832]  Unfit narcissist sociopath.
[00:09:55.212 --> 00:09:56.133]  Threat to humanity.
[00:09:56.553 --> 00:09:57.934]  That's just the latest stuff right there.
[00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:04.879]  And the censorship comes in with a big top star.
[00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.980]  In fact, I guess they say she's the top star.
[00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:08.762]  Period.
[00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:10.275]  Out there.
[00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:13.056]  And of course, everybody knows who I'm talking about.
[00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:16.718]  She won't get into all of this.
[00:10:17.258 --> 00:10:22.420]  She won't join in to all of the endless hating and the rest of it.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.440]  Taylor Swift.
[00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.462]  So, I was reading what the mainstream news and people say about her.
[00:10:30.022 --> 00:10:31.723]  She's aggressively white.
[00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:36.885]  She needs to apologize for the fact that she's even white.
[00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:48.615]  And because she won't attack the president, they're now trying to boycott her and shut down her shows when she's the highest grossing beyond the Beatles, beyond George Strait.
[00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:52.237]  First George Strait broke the Beatles record, and now it's Taylor Swift.
[00:10:53.098 --> 00:11:03.943]  And she's number one, she's apolitical for people that want escapism, and because of that, there's a big move to try to shut her down because she's white.
[00:11:04.383 --> 00:11:07.425]  That is incredible racism.
[00:11:08.848 --> 00:11:09.228]  I don't know.
[00:11:28.783 --> 00:11:33.008]  They're like, hey, you better join us politically, or we're going to call you aggressively white.
[00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:35.651]  And it's white people that are driving this.
[00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:36.372]  It's incredible.
[00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:37.934]  They're looking at demographics.
[00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:41.618]  They're racist white people who use race to control.
[00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.180]  A true racist.
[00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:44.842]  Isn't even believing it.
[00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:47.906]  They're just using it for balkanization and control issues.
[00:11:49.437 --> 00:12:02.666]  They then know that classical Americans are good people and aren't racist, so they can bully us, and they say, you will do what we say, you will pick up our political views, or we will attack you, even if you don't say anything political.
[00:12:02.946 --> 00:12:04.327]  You are our slave.
[00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:11.452]  Taylor Swift has no fear of bullies on the left.
[00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.831]  It's out of the Herald Sun.
[00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:21.495]  The bullying of Taylor Swift for the egregious crime of not publicly supporting Hillary Clinton or denouncing Donald Trump has entered its third year.
[00:12:21.855 --> 00:12:29.860]  Despite unrelenting pressure, Swift refuses to become an overtly political feminist pet who obediently regurgitates lefty talking points.
[00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:33.162]  For this sin, the singer-songwriter has paid a heavy price.
[00:12:33.322 --> 00:12:35.684]  She's been labeled aggressively white.
[00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:43.719]  Linked to Neo-Nazis and accused of being a messenger, these are quotes, for a disturbing new era.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:56.525]  Last week she was criticized by BuzzFeed, that's the PPgate people, the fake news kings, for not taking part in a second annual Women's March, aka the world's longest post-election tantrum.
[00:12:57.045 --> 00:13:02.908]  Another BuzzFeed hit piece blamed Swift for having white supremacist fans and claimed that she is intrinsically
[00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:06.402]  Likened to whiteness and privilege!
[00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:11.205]  And I'm gonna stop there as they move forward with trying to shut her down.
[00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:15.507]  But don't worry, Katy Perry and Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, they'll all play along.
[00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:21.251]  Miley Cyrus while they degrade women and everybody else and cover up for Hollywood's incredible crimes.
[00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:28.375]  Then you watch these women's marches that love Hillary when she's the poster child of covering up men abusing women, raping women.
[00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:34.824]  And Sharon Stone is in the news saying, Harvey Weinstein, you know, you don't give somebody the death penalty for a parking ticket.
[00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:35.384]  That's a quote.
[00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:50.512]  We've got dozens of witnesses, people that are credible, like his chauffeur, like his butlers, saying he would jump on top women, small women's what he likes, like 100 pounds, and rape them with them begging and pleading with their legs back behind their ears.
[00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.254]  That's what rape is.
[00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:54.680]  When you're a big man and you force yourself on a woman.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.965]  That's rape, rape, rape.
[00:13:57.225 --> 00:13:58.067]  And I got three daughters.
[00:13:58.328 --> 00:14:00.993]  You rape one of my daughters, you're not gonna have to wait for the police to come.
[00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:09.242]  You know, it's better for you to know that it's better to be tried by nine than carried by six.
[00:14:09.262 --> 00:14:10.603]  And that's what's going to happen to you.
[00:14:10.623 --> 00:14:11.763]  You're going to be getting carried by six.
[00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:13.024]  You touch my daughters.
[00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:16.446]  The point is, is these people signal, signal, signal, signal, signal.
[00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:25.370]  Well, Oprah is bringing people in to basically be thrown at Weinstein.
[00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:31.793]  They say it's like, I thought it'd be safe because Oprah's there and all of a sudden she turns me over to Weinstein.
[00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:42.914]  We're going to talk more about this when we come back from break, but Vanity Fair has photoshopped a male actor out because a girlfriend said once he forced her head down too forcefully.
[00:14:43.574 --> 00:14:44.574]  In consensual sex.
[00:14:44.794 --> 00:14:48.716]  I'm not defending, who knows, it's Hollywood, the thing's a cesspool, it's a latrine.
[00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:53.398]  But oh, they left Oprah in the photoshop.
[00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:54.818]  You see?
[00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:56.419]  We'll show you that.
[00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:57.664]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:19.479]  Saying, oh yeah, we're the bitches.
[00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.479]  We're the nasty women.
[00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.800]  Yeah, let's go, bitches.
[00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.722]  And that's what the women say in these marches.
[00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:25.482]  We hate men.
[00:15:25.502 --> 00:15:26.583]  We're nasty.
[00:15:27.383 --> 00:15:28.644]  We're into being gross.
[00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:30.785]  We're into being selfish.
[00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:32.466]  We don't want to be appealing.
[00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:33.707]  We want to be ugly.
[00:15:33.727 --> 00:15:35.188]  And that's why studies show
[00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.049]  Liberals are seen.
[00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:41.612]  Five to one is more ugly than conservatives across the board in every culture.
[00:15:41.632 --> 00:15:44.133]  And we've got those documents coming up as well.
[00:15:44.173 --> 00:15:46.335]  But the big news is also coming up.
[00:15:46.675 --> 00:15:49.857]  Trump ignores DOJ warning once FISA memo released.
[00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:50.998]  Stay with us.
[00:15:51.058 --> 00:15:52.659]  And the State of the Union is coming up as well.
[00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.080]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:58.212]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[00:15:58.272 --> 00:16:02.816]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:03.597 --> 00:16:05.278]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:07.760]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.640]  Here is the trailer.
[00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:13.324]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:15.626]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:19.068]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:19.609]  Who cares?
[00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:24.263]  You haven't been called.
[00:16:26.144 --> 00:16:27.184]  Go back to Univision.
[00:16:27.364 --> 00:16:29.944]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[00:16:29.984 --> 00:16:31.005]  He's very low energy.
[00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:35.546]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:36.126]  Throw him out.
[00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:37.226]  Throw him out into the cold.
[00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:40.047]  Don't give him their coat.
[00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:43.047]  No coats.
[00:16:43.407 --> 00:16:44.768]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[00:16:44.848 --> 00:16:46.168]  Lying dead.
[00:16:50.563 --> 00:16:53.664]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[00:16:53.684 --> 00:16:54.924]  The most dishonest human beings.
[00:16:54.964 --> 00:16:58.325]  These people right here.
[00:16:58.345 --> 00:17:01.686]  Look at all the cameras.
[00:17:01.706 --> 00:17:04.646]  So disgusting.
[00:17:04.666 --> 00:17:06.447]  This socialist slash communist.
[00:17:06.867 --> 00:17:07.747]  Crazy murder.
[00:17:07.807 --> 00:17:09.327]  He's crazy as it may look.
[00:17:11.828 --> 00:17:12.548]  Pocahontas?
[00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:13.428]  The Indian?
[00:17:13.628 --> 00:17:14.568]  Very offensive.
[00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:15.889]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:16.609]  Pocahontas?
[00:17:18.983 --> 00:17:19.624]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:17:19.704 --> 00:17:20.885]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:22.987]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:28.952]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:17:28.992 --> 00:17:32.375]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[00:17:32.475 --> 00:17:35.898]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[00:17:35.918 --> 00:17:37.639]  This had nothing to do with me.
[00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:39.321]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[00:17:41.454 --> 00:17:43.577]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[00:17:43.737 --> 00:17:45.560]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.922]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[00:17:47.623 --> 00:17:49.185]  Because they were protecting him.
[00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:50.206]  I'm trying to be nice.
[00:17:50.246 --> 00:17:51.728]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.632]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.675]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:57.857]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:02.049]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[00:18:02.189 --> 00:18:02.890]  It just doesn't work.
[00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.090]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:08.052]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[00:18:08.072 --> 00:18:10.873]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[00:18:12.014 --> 00:18:13.674]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[00:18:13.694 --> 00:18:17.396]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[00:18:17.676 --> 00:18:18.617]  Repeat after me.
[00:18:18.637 --> 00:18:21.458]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.878]  That's not going to happen.
[00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:24.239]  So help me God.
[00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.900]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.004]  We will make America great again!
[00:18:36.247 --> 00:18:37.289]  Go home to mommy.
[00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.873]  Don't want to tuck you in bed.
[00:18:39.154 --> 00:18:40.697]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[00:18:42.071 --> 00:18:43.292]  You made a lot of amazing films.
[00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:44.073]  We carried them all.
[00:18:44.353 --> 00:18:44.973]  We sell them all.
[00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:45.734]  They're all groundbreaking.
[00:18:45.754 --> 00:18:47.536]  But this one, this one is fun.
[00:18:48.216 --> 00:18:49.477]  And very, very celebratory.
[00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:52.039]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:52.900]  It's really a special film.
[00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:54.461]  Thanks a lot.
[00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:59.305]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.788]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:06.111]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:19.198]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[00:19:19.498 --> 00:19:22.659]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[00:19:22.699 --> 00:19:23.680]  That's why it stuck.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.903]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:29.983]  I thought I knew Trump.
[00:19:30.083 --> 00:19:30.904]  I studied Trump.
[00:19:31.364 --> 00:19:32.064]  I thought I knew him.
[00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:35.386]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:37.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.642 --> 00:20:29.786]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.891]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.192]  I want to get into the big news dealing with the...
[00:20:40.074 --> 00:20:43.715]  Secret FISA memo that could be released as early as tomorrow.
[00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:44.516]  The State of the Union.
[00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:46.336]  Just huge news on that front.
[00:20:46.456 --> 00:20:49.637]  Breaking exclusive intel on the secrets of QAnon.
[00:20:50.197 --> 00:20:53.879]  One of these intelligence sources that's been proven to be frighteningly accurate.
[00:20:54.699 --> 00:20:58.360]  We'll have Dr. Corsi coming up at the end of the broadcast for two segments.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.881]  Breaking that down here.
[00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:00.741]  It's all coming up.
[00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:04.691]  But just getting back in to the hypocrisy of Hollywood.
[00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:11.116]  I know all of us listening, most of us, are aware that Hollywood's a cesspool, that they're hypocrites, that they're out of control.
[00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:20.824]  But again, Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein for decades, reportedly raping scores of women, not just abusing them.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.240]  I don't know.
[00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:44.100]  Says Weinstein used Oprah as bait for sex.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.764]  Actors say Oprah duped her into thinking Weinstein would help her career.
[00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:59.157]  So it's well known that she was a prostitute, Oprah, that Oprah hires prostitutes, that Oprah is a lesbian, which, again, I'm not attacking her for that, I'm just, that's the facts, and that
[00:22:00.518 --> 00:22:03.620]  She's at the very core of the elite of Hollywood.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.300]  What's that tell you?
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.121]  Oh, but did Vanity Fair... Let's put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:13.324]  Did Vanity Fair photoshop her out of the latest issue coming out?
[00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:17.286]  With all of these other Hollywood
[00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:25.368]  I mean all of these Trump haters who just go out and virtue signal and try to stop the economy coming back.
[00:22:25.448 --> 00:22:30.554]  Tom Hanks and of course other losers like Robert De Niro that said Trump would never be president.
[00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:31.895]  He's a punk and wants to beat him up.
[00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:33.377]  Harrison Ford.
[00:22:33.857 --> 00:22:36.640]  I mean who could go see any movies these losers are in?
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.885]  And right there there's Oprah with women sexually all over her.
[00:22:42.097 --> 00:22:51.162]  One woman's between her legs, other woman's got her breast shoved in her face, and they're letting you know who the goddess is right there, with all the little goddesses attached to her like harpies.
[00:22:51.922 --> 00:22:53.643]  So they're telling you everything you need to know right there.
[00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:57.465]  And then Franco, James Franco, he's edited out.
[00:22:59.746 --> 00:23:02.668]  And he's saying, he comes up and says, okay, his girlfriend says, well,
[00:23:03.846 --> 00:23:09.788]  Eighteen years ago or something, he shoved my face down in his crotch, you know, in the car when he was my boyfriend.
[00:23:10.068 --> 00:23:10.348]  Okay?
[00:23:10.769 --> 00:23:11.689]  Another girl, yeah.
[00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:15.310]  You know, once he got me really drunk and we had sex and he was rude to me.
[00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:15.990]  Okay.
[00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.612]  I mean, the guy does come off kind of like a, you know, partying moron.
[00:23:20.952 --> 00:23:22.153]  Put him in jail if he did something wrong.
[00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:24.574]  But what about Oprah?
[00:23:24.594 --> 00:23:26.994]  See, you don't Photoshop her up.
[00:23:27.595 --> 00:23:30.136]  It's the total and complete hypocrisy.
[00:23:30.196 --> 00:23:30.856]  And then meanwhile,
[00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:33.987]  There's other hypocrisy here.
[00:23:34.647 --> 00:23:41.373]  You've got this family, arrested after 12 children, ages 2 to 29, found shackled in a California home.
[00:23:41.813 --> 00:23:47.758]  Now they've released photos of a Texas home that was foreclosed on a few years ago that was just absolutely nightmarish.
[00:23:48.438 --> 00:23:53.342]  And I say because they were Christians, Christians, Christians, and homeschoolers, as if homeschoolers do this.
[00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:55.404]  It's all over the news saying that.
[00:23:57.841 --> 00:24:05.910]  When CNN or others do report on tens of thousands of men, women, and children being sold into slavery, nowhere is there anything about Islam.
[00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:10.956]  CNN this week, people for sale, where lives are auctioned for $400.
[00:24:11.737 --> 00:24:12.778]  Men, women, and children.
[00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:18.104]  But never do they tell you in the whole article, it's legal under Islamic law.
[00:24:19.787 --> 00:24:20.628]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:20.748 --> 00:24:21.509]  Never, never.
[00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:22.870]  People for sale.
[00:24:23.471 --> 00:24:41.369]  Since Hillary came and helped bring down Libya and blow up its infrastructure, now Saharan, Sub-Saharan Africans come in, mainly animist, some of them Christian, out of Southern Sudan, and they say in the article, oh, they were kidnapped in Southern Sudan by Muslims!
[00:24:43.484 --> 00:24:44.767]  It's all over the foreign press.
[00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:45.949]  It's all over the African press.
[00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:50.938]  The ongoing civil war for 30 years as the Muslims have invaded into Sudan and taken 90% of it.
[00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.110]  But that's why it's so frustrating.
[00:24:54.190 --> 00:25:00.733]  I mean, I turn on television, I walk into a restaurant, it's the family with the 12 kids, and how bad Christians are.
[00:25:00.953 --> 00:25:02.753]  Christians, Christians, Christians, homeschoolers, homeschoolers.
[00:25:03.133 --> 00:25:08.115]  But then, I see on the news, oh look, poor Sudanese, they're being sold into slavery.
[00:25:08.655 --> 00:25:10.556]  Oh, since Libya is a failed state.
[00:25:10.856 --> 00:25:14.017]  No discussion of Anderson Cooper, CNN, everyone's cheerleading.
[00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.766]  Qaddafi, who'd been working with the U.S.
[00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:37.899]  for a decade, he'd invested all his money with us, he'd stopped being a terrorist, he'd built all this infrastructure, he was helping Africa, Obama double-crossed him, let him take over, Hillary went and said, I came, I saw, he died, they ruined the country, and you've got people from all over Southern Sudan, Central Sudan, Eastern, Niger,
[00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:45.467]  Algeria going up into Libya being promised they can get to Europe and instead they get sold into slavery by Muslims.
[00:25:45.787 --> 00:25:55.051]  Then they use the pain of the public seeing these poor people and they go, oh they're migrants, we've got to let more in.
[00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:57.092]  Or they'll be put into slavery.
[00:25:57.252 --> 00:26:11.084]  They're coming up out of Central Africa and out of Eastern Africa because they got kidnapped in Islamic slave trade of Boko Haram that's gone all the way to the west into Nigeria and is threatening to take the entire country!
[00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:17.149]  There's a giant Islamic invasion that Obama and his cousin Odinga run out of Kenya.
[00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:18.070]  This is all on record.
[00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.792]  Muslim Brotherhood, all of it, out of Egypt.
[00:26:21.943 --> 00:26:24.284]  We say, we the U.S.
[00:26:24.324 --> 00:26:29.165]  under Obama overthrew our allies in Egypt and they blew up hundreds of churches and killed tens of thousands.
[00:26:30.446 --> 00:26:41.429]  Oh, but James Franco once, his girlfriend movie star said he once aggressively shoved her head down in a car because she wasn't giving him good enough of a fellatio.
[00:26:42.378 --> 00:26:43.159]  Okay, he's a punk.
[00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:43.959]  Punch him in the nose.
[00:26:44.199 --> 00:26:45.760]  Call your daddy or brother and have him kick his ass.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.821]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:26:47.141 --> 00:26:49.082]  The point is, oh, but see, you don't have a daddy.
[00:26:49.102 --> 00:26:49.983]  You're not supposed to have a family.
[00:26:50.263 --> 00:26:51.544]  You've got the state, don't you?
[00:26:52.445 --> 00:27:07.835]  But the very state that does all this helps the Islamicist run these massive operations and go in and kidnap black people from all over Africa as far south and west as Nigeria.
[00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:10.957]  And CNN has maps showing all of this.
[00:27:13.897 --> 00:27:15.798]  And, but does it tell you they're Muslims?
[00:27:15.818 --> 00:27:16.439]  They're Muslims!
[00:27:16.459 --> 00:27:17.059]  They're Muslims!
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:17.920]  They're Muslims!
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.721]  It's Muslims doing it!
[00:27:21.323 --> 00:27:21.743]  Libya.
[00:27:22.023 --> 00:27:23.684]  Slave footage sparks outrage.
[00:27:23.724 --> 00:27:24.325]  BBC.
[00:27:24.965 --> 00:27:30.429]  And if you dig deep enough, you'll finally find ISIS, but remember Obama told us ISIS is not Islam.
[00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.932]  Power is waning, but its child slave trade is booming!
[00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.723]  A Yazidi captive's tale.
[00:27:39.183 --> 00:27:40.844]  Sold by ISIS as a sex slave.
[00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:42.785]  Some little girls as young as five.
[00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:47.547]  ISIS captures 7,000 women and kids to sell them on social media as sex slaves.
[00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:56.932]  Meanwhile, here's what the children in the California torture house did to cope with the abuse.
[00:27:57.212 --> 00:27:57.792]  Okay, great.
[00:27:58.372 --> 00:27:58.873]  It's terrible.
[00:27:59.613 --> 00:28:02.895]  Mentally ill, crazy people that were doing this.
[00:28:02.935 --> 00:28:03.735]  Were they organized?
[00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:05.156]  Were they invading half of Africa?
[00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:05.216]  No!
[00:28:06.693 --> 00:28:08.514]  And fine, tell us they were Christians, okay?
[00:28:08.714 --> 00:28:12.295]  You got some bad so-called mentally ill people that call themselves Christians.
[00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:17.277]  They're not organized, taken over half the Middle East and other areas and backed by our government.
[00:28:17.777 --> 00:28:18.437]  That's the problem.
[00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:23.939]  And Trump comes in and ends that practice, to a great extent.
[00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:26.480]  The CIA and others are still kind of halfway doing it.
[00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:31.686]  And they act like he is Adolf Hitler returned in the flesh.
[00:28:32.107 --> 00:28:34.027]  Adolf Hitler was the one working with the Muslims, by the way.
[00:28:34.067 --> 00:28:34.427]  Look it up.
[00:28:34.887 --> 00:28:39.809]  And if you try to talk about it on German social media, they ban you, even if you're a professor or a journalist.
[00:28:40.069 --> 00:28:45.091]  You can't show pictures of Hitler going and meeting with all the top Muslims that universally pledge their allegiance to him.
[00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:49.232]  We'll be back with my huge breakdown, a key analysis.
[00:28:49.632 --> 00:28:50.273]  You don't want to miss.
[00:28:50.293 --> 00:28:50.993]  This is critical.
[00:28:51.213 --> 00:28:54.034]  Please spread the live links and tell folks about your local affiliates you're listening to.
[00:28:56.574 --> 00:29:01.417]  I have promoted and sold hundreds of great products in my 22 years on air.
[00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:05.519]  But this one right here is in the top three.
[00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:07.060]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.842]  You can buy filters similar to this one for $500 to $600 that are three stage.
[00:29:10.862 --> 00:29:13.544]  Alexa Pure Breeze is $200, has a four filter system,
[00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:26.963]  Including Ion, Cluster, Charcoal, and more.
[00:29:28.485 --> 00:29:34.673]  That is completely game-changing and costs less than half of leading competitors.
[00:29:35.594 --> 00:29:37.016]  And when you look at the specs,
[00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:39.009]  It's just amazing.
[00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:48.054]  When you first turn it on in a room, it's red, meaning it's picking up particulate, it's picking up pathogens, it's picking up gases, it's picking up toxins.
[00:29:48.434 --> 00:29:54.596]  And it might take 10 minutes, it might take an hour for it to turn pink and then blue when it's picking nothing up.
[00:29:54.677 --> 00:29:55.677]  And these are so strong.
[00:29:56.057 --> 00:29:58.858]  In my home, if I sneeze 20 feet away,
[00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:03.063]  In a few seconds, it goes from blue to red.
[00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:04.785]  It's picking up that particular.
[00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:14.397]  That's what's so amazing about this unit is the sensors are so strong and the four filtration systems are so compact but so powerful.
[00:30:14.518 --> 00:30:17.902]  Could you spend way more and get something that maybe has a little bit better specs?
[00:30:17.962 --> 00:30:18.122]  Yes.
[00:30:18.803 --> 00:30:24.068]  But there are a lot of filters out there that are $500, $600, $700 that aren't even as good.
[00:30:24.348 --> 00:30:28.231]  And again, these can go six months to a year, depending on how dirty the environment is.
[00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:31.053]  The replacement filters are very, very inexpensive.
[00:30:31.574 --> 00:30:35.537]  Do yourself a favor and go to infowarstore.com today.
[00:30:35.978 --> 00:30:37.139]  Read the specs for yourself.
[00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:39.280]  And then you have nothing to lose.
[00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.761]  Spend $200.
[00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:43.924]  Help us make $50 to fund our operation.
[00:30:44.284 --> 00:30:46.465]  Get an amazing unit in your home.
[00:30:46.746 --> 00:30:54.351]  I'm very confident that we're gonna see you come back and order several more, and then a few more for your office, and then to give them as gifts as well.
[00:30:54.631 --> 00:30:57.794]  There are studies, and listen to me carefully, all over the world
[00:30:58.797 --> 00:31:12.063]  And depending on the study, it's between 7 and 12 years that the average person loses off their life expectancy living in a big city alone because of the toxins and the particulates.
[00:31:12.363 --> 00:31:14.744]  You then add all the pollen and the rest of it.
[00:31:15.764 --> 00:31:23.948]  It is not a luxury to have the Alexa Pure Breeze that is the best filtration system out there at the lowest price.
[00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:26.549]  It is essential.
[00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:34.209]  We are doing everything we can to mitigate the toxic environment that industrial society has created.
[00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.670]  So support the Infowar.
[00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:43.913]  Fund folks that are fighting the globalists and having success, and get a system that purifies and cleans the air for yourself and your family.
[00:31:44.173 --> 00:31:46.754]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze at InfowarStore.com.
[00:31:46.994 --> 00:31:52.316]  We also have their full line of amazing gravity-fed filters as well, which are a huge home run.
[00:31:52.616 --> 00:31:56.018]  But this, this is a grand slam.
[00:31:59.702 --> 00:32:04.024]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:32:04.404 --> 00:32:05.905]  U-U-U-Optimum levels.
[00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:11.568]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:32:11.588 --> 00:32:13.509]  U-U-U-Optimum levels.
[00:32:13.929 --> 00:32:15.530]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.793]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:32:20.993 --> 00:32:22.594]  U-U-U-Optimal absorption.
[00:32:23.314 --> 00:32:28.398]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:29.319]  Secret 12.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.660]  Optimal absorption.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.644]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:32:37.084 --> 00:32:41.307]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:43.009]  Optimum levels.
[00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:48.251]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:52.954]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:55.555]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:00.137 --> 00:33:02.778]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:12.754 --> 00:33:14.816]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.876 --> 00:33:17.379]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:18.940]  I was asked to speak three years ago.
[00:33:37.793 --> 00:33:49.256]  At the Oxford Union, it's one of the most historical and interesting places to give a speech, and it's been well known for having controversial speakers for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:33:50.157 --> 00:34:00.700]  I was unable to do it because I was in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle with my ex-wife at the time, so it wasn't a snub to the Oxford Union.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:06.902]  But then it reminded me, the reason I tell this story is, that when I was talking to Roger Stone last night,
[00:34:07.955 --> 00:34:17.639]  About the fact that he's going to be traveling to the UK starting tomorrow to address the Oxford Union.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.762]  I told Roger what I was intending to say even three years ago.
[00:34:26.678 --> 00:34:37.904]  at the Oxford Union and how, in the modern times, so much more has happened along that line, that visionary line, and that I thought he should speak on some of those topics.
[00:34:38.845 --> 00:34:42.046]  And he said, that's amazing, Alex, because here's my notes.
[00:34:42.987 --> 00:34:44.448]  They just asked me to speak last week.
[00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:46.008]  This is what I'm intending to talk about.
[00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:50.491]  In fact, I want to join you Monday before I fly out in the evening.
[00:34:50.531 --> 00:34:51.511]  That's how all those flights are.
[00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:52.412]  You fly out in the evening and
[00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.671]  Get there when it's the morning over there.
[00:34:54.691 --> 00:35:02.177]  And he said, so I will come on Monday and kind of give you the speech that I'm going to give to the Oxford Union.
[00:35:02.537 --> 00:35:07.501]  And we're going to send a crew as well that will be meeting up with him.
[00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:15.187]  So that is going to be something we'll maybe even carry live once we get in place over there.
[00:35:15.327 --> 00:35:16.508]  But that's all a side issue.
[00:35:18.689 --> 00:35:20.311]  It just reminded me
[00:35:22.958 --> 00:35:30.763]  Of the speech I wanted to give that was more of a Anglo-centric, Anglophile perspective.
[00:35:31.143 --> 00:35:32.404]  Doesn't mean I'm an Anglophile.
[00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:35.585]  It doesn't mean that I'm obsessed with the UK.
[00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:38.587]  Even though my surname is Welsh.
[00:35:38.607 --> 00:35:41.669]  I think it's a fine culture, beautiful country, great people.
[00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:48.013]  It's just that three years ago, that would have been a speech that I would have given them there.
[00:35:52.523 --> 00:35:56.288]  But now that speech is a speech you can give to the entire planet.
[00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:06.942]  And about five years ago I spoke outside Bilderberg, north of London, in the rolling grass hills above an elite meeting house where the Bilderberg Group was meeting.
[00:36:07.222 --> 00:36:09.185]  We had over 3,000 people in attendance.
[00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:30.598]  And I had the folks from the UK chanting, the answer to 1984 is 1776, with more gusto than they do here in the US, because I'd just given a prototype of the speech that I would give a year and a half later at Oxford, if I had gone, and then now, the complete speech, I would give today.
[00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:38.460]  And now that I'm up to the point of giving the speech, when you're sitting there thinking about a speech,
[00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.011]  It's so much more easy than just giving it.
[00:36:42.732 --> 00:36:44.413]  And by that, I can talk endlessly.
[00:36:45.655 --> 00:36:47.756]  It's just that it's such a big idea.
[00:36:48.557 --> 00:37:00.647]  It's so true that I don't want to just sit here and say these things and have it just be something that's mixed into the background of everything else we talk about, because it's all super important.
[00:37:01.307 --> 00:37:02.729]  In fact, things are so crazy.
[00:37:03.129 --> 00:37:06.492]  Going about our business, once you know this stuff, is obscene.
[00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:12.648]  And so now I don't even know if I can give that speech.
[00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:15.991]  It's not that my tongue is even tied.
[00:37:19.753 --> 00:37:28.679]  It's just so real, so important, that I don't feel worthy.
[00:37:34.723 --> 00:37:35.583]  I've done the research.
[00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:36.764]  I know who the globalists are.
[00:37:37.745 --> 00:37:38.665]  I know what their plan is.
[00:37:40.919 --> 00:37:47.122]  You notice everything I told you 15 years ago is word for word coming out of Elon Musk's mouth right now.
[00:37:48.303 --> 00:37:50.144]  And it's not because he plagiarized what I was saying.
[00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:53.225]  Finally, there's a break with the elite.
[00:37:55.386 --> 00:37:58.508]  And a bunch of people in the establishment don't want this plan to continue.
[00:37:58.928 --> 00:38:08.193]  And so people like Elon Musk have backing from people in NASA, in the Pentagon, in the Trump administration.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:23.185]  How many times did I say they'll create a one world government where you worship an AI computer that can give you advanced technology or quote, eternal life, but you really won't get eternal life.
[00:38:23.205 --> 00:38:33.070]  You'll be told that you're going to get rid of this body and enter this silicon system and that you won't hurt the earth anymore.
[00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.951]  And so there's going to be pressure for everybody to do this.
[00:38:37.432 --> 00:39:04.903]  And they're gonna be able to tap into the pleasure centers, they're gonna be able to basically make it whatever you want, while you're still conscious and alive, plugged into it, and it's gonna be the greatest con of cons, the king of cons, that you'll believe your loved ones and things are inside the big computer system, and they'll have avatars and robot bodies they're in, and they'll even have biological bodies in the future, that are
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.623]  Completely artificial, but are biological, and you will think it's your family member.
[00:39:12.924 --> 00:39:32.977]  It'll have the sayings, it'll have the mannerisms, it'll have it all, because in the future, they'll be able to track everything you say, everything you do for years, and have an algorithm, just like Amazon can already, five years ago, tell you what you're gonna order with 99% accuracy, and already have your package preloaded days before you order it, and ready to ship to you.
[00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:41.153]  People are going to believe they're talking to their loved ones inside of these avatars, inside of these AI systems, and it's not.
[00:39:43.894 --> 00:39:44.914]  And that's the big line.
[00:39:45.274 --> 00:39:48.556]  And that's going to be the great abomination that's going to come.
[00:39:50.356 --> 00:39:53.578]  And the dehumanization and the genetic engineering and all of it.
[00:39:55.018 --> 00:40:01.061]  The speech has to be linear, though, with the development of humanity, the city-states, the nation-states, the elites.
[00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:16.555]  The eugenics, the robber barons, the mind wars, the 20th century, the war for the future, which we're now in, the decision humans are obsolete, the decision to go to this silicon-based system that the globalists believe is going to be eternal life.
[00:40:16.815 --> 00:40:21.480]  Ray Kurzweil is the top futurist technologist at Google, and he's completely insane.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.844]  Okay, invented scan printers 40 years ago, 50 years ago, whatever, big deal.
[00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:33.108]  Ray Kurzweil says, off my father's papers and notes and things like telecomputer, it's going to recreate him.
[00:40:33.368 --> 00:40:34.669]  And I don't believe in God yet.
[00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:35.509]  I'm going to be God.
[00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:41.372]  Well, he may be crazy enough down the road to believe it's his dad off notebooks.
[00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:47.796]  But imagine computers and face scanners and all these ubiquitous systems in our houses that record everything we do.
[00:40:49.033 --> 00:41:00.375]  In 3D dimension, you will be able to take that data and put it in a humanoid, in a robot, whatever you want, and your mama won't be able to tell it's not you.
[00:41:01.436 --> 00:41:02.196]  But it's not you.
[00:41:04.556 --> 00:41:12.438]  We can't let this body live forever, but don't worry, you upload yourself into this computer, and into this system,
[00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:20.905]  It's going to be we, we're all going to be together, but you'll still have your individualism, and everything that's in you, everything you are, we're going to control.
[00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:41.841]  Because when you realize you read 2001 Space Odyssey, you read Childhood's End, that was MI6, OSS before that, Prairie of the Telecommunications Satellite, Arthur C. Clarke, he later gave speeches and things where he basically admitted, I'm a Luciferian, I believe all this, we're going to have to transcend our bodies,
[00:41:42.722 --> 00:41:49.429]  To become the new superhuman, and his thinking is the thinking of the insiders, and you know what?
[00:41:49.909 --> 00:41:51.791]  They'll argue, hey, we really are gonna be gods.
[00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:55.995]  Look, we did all this, and we envisioned it, and we used builders.
[00:41:57.477 --> 00:41:58.338]  We used people.
[00:42:01.401 --> 00:42:02.302]  We used people.
[00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:27.196]  To then have the idea, put it out there, and then enough money, enough taxpayer money, enough $700 toilet seats, the money siphoned off to actually build these Manhattan Project-type systems of AI, supercomputers, quantum, you know, engines, all of it, to then be able to build the breakaway mass civilization that the establishment thinks it's gonna get in.
[00:42:27.556 --> 00:42:31.819]  It believes the Earth's gonna fail, fall, all the rest of this, is consigned like an egg
[00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:42.731]  Being fertilized, the earth is simply the engine and the material to build the metamorphosis of what they're going to become.
[00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:47.134]  And so we're just the fuel for their operation.
[00:42:47.154 --> 00:42:47.714]  Well, guess what?
[00:42:48.655 --> 00:42:51.817]  We're going to have a discussion about this, but I haven't gotten to the next level.
[00:42:52.757 --> 00:42:53.938]  When we return, stay with us.
[00:42:56.916 --> 00:43:00.739]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.

[00:43:06.244 --> 00:43:09.907]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:13.710]  Listen to all these incredible 5 star reviews from verified buyers.
[00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.153]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[00:43:17.413 --> 00:43:19.575]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin.
[00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:26.777]  And it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[00:43:26.878 --> 00:43:29.238]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:31.159]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:34.000]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.782]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[00:43:39.102 --> 00:43:45.164]  AlphaPower makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[00:43:45.604 --> 00:43:50.147]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[00:43:50.608 --> 00:43:51.768]  That helps with focus, too.
[00:43:52.189 --> 00:43:53.169]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:57.792]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[00:43:58.213 --> 00:44:02.256]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[00:44:02.536 --> 00:44:04.077]  There's definitely been a change.
[00:44:04.337 --> 00:44:04.977]  For the better.
[00:44:05.418 --> 00:44:09.180]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:11.262]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:12.563]  I hope this lasts.
[00:44:13.403 --> 00:44:15.465]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[00:44:15.745 --> 00:44:21.870]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[00:44:22.171 --> 00:44:27.095]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[00:44:27.575 --> 00:44:30.878]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[00:44:31.478 --> 00:44:36.503]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[00:44:37.063 --> 00:44:38.844]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:39.644]  Not anymore.
[00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:41.225]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[00:44:41.805 --> 00:44:43.626]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[00:44:43.866 --> 00:44:45.246]  I will definitely buy this again.
[00:44:46.047 --> 00:44:49.368]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[00:44:50.068 --> 00:44:51.829]  That's infowarrestore.com.
[00:44:57.148 --> 00:45:00.011]  Trace in New Jersey wants to talk about vaccines.
[00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:00.611]  Go ahead, Trace.
[00:45:01.112 --> 00:45:06.237]  First off, I wanted to start off with saying I've been waiting hours to talk to you, my man.
[00:45:06.277 --> 00:45:07.818]  You're one of my most favorite hosts.
[00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:15.846]  Second, I'd like to say Super Blue, Survival Shield, the Skelton Defense Pack,
[00:45:16.852 --> 00:45:26.434]  They're all amazing, and I just ordered them all again, along with the Organic Urban Garden Seed Kit at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:26.494 --> 00:45:32.936]  But back to my point, in the early 1990s, ADHD was on the rise.
[00:45:33.796 --> 00:45:37.557]  My parents, they didn't believe that vaccines could ever hurt anybody.
[00:45:38.137 --> 00:45:40.318]  Yet, I found out, yes, I do have ADHD.
[00:45:41.558 --> 00:45:44.999]  I've been taking RainForce now for about almost two years.
[00:45:46.128 --> 00:45:49.291]  And with BrainForce, I'm able to focus perfectly.
[00:45:50.472 --> 00:45:57.539]  And my parents said that before the age of seven, I was not as hyperactive.
[00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:09.890]  And that's what got me, you know, PQ'd, wondering, hey, maybe, maybe it was something in a vaccine that could have triggered this change in me that made me so hyperactive.
[00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:11.151]  What is it?
[00:46:12.242 --> 00:46:16.566]  I do think that we're seeing a lot of these behavior disabilities.
[00:46:16.906 --> 00:46:23.352]  For one, we're cramming kids into a classroom for eight hours a day and expecting them to sit and shut up and not talk.
[00:46:24.433 --> 00:46:25.533]  And put their hands on their lap.
[00:46:26.214 --> 00:46:27.415]  So I think that's part of the problem.
[00:46:27.715 --> 00:46:31.639]  And then I think the other part of the problem is we're also injecting them with vaccines.
[00:46:31.699 --> 00:46:36.763]  It's probably having an increased incidence of developmental disabilities.
[00:46:36.823 --> 00:46:37.804]  What's your take on that, Roy?
[00:46:38.024 --> 00:46:51.937]  I wanna, you know, say to Trace, I think it's really great that he's asking questions and he's, you know, he's looking at things like brain force and he's thinking about, you know, things that he can do to take control of his own health.
[00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.788]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.897 --> 00:47:23.159]  Welcome back, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:47:23.459 --> 00:47:26.121]  Why am I so pro-Trump?
[00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:27.442]  Because the globalists hate him?
[00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:31.464]  He's trying to build a future pro-family, pro-God, pro-human.
[00:47:32.625 --> 00:47:36.748]  You can say, well I don't like the corruption of the big churches, and I don't like all the... I get it.
[00:47:38.354 --> 00:47:40.575]  What are the people coming and rebelling against that?
[00:47:41.395 --> 00:47:42.735]  What are they replacing it with?
[00:47:43.856 --> 00:47:47.297]  Well, if you don't believe in the world beast system, that's fine.
[00:47:47.737 --> 00:47:51.978]  The globalists definitely are taking it as a model and building it.
[00:47:52.899 --> 00:48:01.361]  And humans are able, when we have enough technological base and cultural base, to basically build and construct and create anything we want to.
[00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:03.102]  We are incredible creatures.
[00:48:05.595 --> 00:48:19.707]  And so the basis of the speech that I would give, so something like the Oxford Union, would be political first and just a snapshot historically to parallel.
[00:48:22.629 --> 00:48:26.352]  To focus in on the power of the individual, the power of people.
[00:48:26.692 --> 00:48:27.713]  And this is where I would begin.
[00:48:29.795 --> 00:48:33.158]  Hitler was funded
[00:48:34.462 --> 00:48:36.644]  By the Rockefeller Foundation on record.
[00:48:37.364 --> 00:48:38.145]  Have a PowerPoint.
[00:48:38.826 --> 00:48:39.666]  Put the articles up.
[00:48:40.067 --> 00:48:41.608]  New York Times articles, you name it.
[00:48:42.168 --> 00:48:48.033]  Showing Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Adolf Hitler, Margaret Sanger, IBM, the Holocaust, all of it.
[00:48:49.254 --> 00:48:51.316]  And so I would first point out, there's a struggle.
[00:48:55.379 --> 00:49:01.204]  Where you've got the United States and our robber barons funding the Nazi party, starting in the late 20s.
[00:49:03.584 --> 00:49:08.048]  And simultaneously, and again this is just a small snapshot of history, but it's so frustrating.
[00:49:08.268 --> 00:49:11.510]  So I can go in on any little snapshot and then build out and connect it to everything.
[00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:13.492]  Because it's all there, we know exactly what happened.
[00:49:14.053 --> 00:49:17.595]  This is just the one little piece of the timeline we're jumping in on, you understand?
[00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:21.358]  Giant timeline, we're jumping in on one little piece of it.
[00:49:21.999 --> 00:49:29.165]  And just my limited knowledge of it, which is still way more expansive than most people out there except globalists who use this knowledge to control people.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.242]  Trump and myself and others are trying to decentralize this knowledge.
[00:49:34.282 --> 00:49:35.683]  It's the only way to save humanity.
[00:49:35.903 --> 00:49:36.944]  And I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:49:36.984 --> 00:49:39.585]  They believe centralizing it is the way to save humanity.
[00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:47.890]  By ending humanity, by unifying it into one huge system so that, oh, we're all too powerful as individuals.
[00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.991]  We could all destroy the earth at any time.
[00:49:50.031 --> 00:49:51.092]  We're all like gods.
[00:49:51.552 --> 00:49:54.134]  So we all have to be one now to watch each other.
[00:49:55.114 --> 00:49:56.094]  That's total insanity.
[00:49:56.134 --> 00:49:57.975]  The answer is into space.
[00:49:58.696 --> 00:49:59.496]  That's the answer.
[00:50:00.436 --> 00:50:13.062]  And to have a moral system based on that and have a giant launch because we are so dangerous to get as far away from each other as possible to then set up competing systems and out of that new United States of the Galaxy.
[00:50:13.283 --> 00:50:13.903]  And I'm serious.
[00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:22.631]  In the future, it'll create new states, and then you can decide what human groups, or whatever humans become, deal with each other.
[00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:25.872]  And that's really the real quantum leap in this thinking.
[00:50:26.412 --> 00:50:38.516]  The decision has been made to wall off the future, give you football, give you iPhones, give you entertainment, have men strutting around acting tough, and women all, you know, freaked out and feeling alone and wondering what happened to them, or our species is being terminated.
[00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:46.077]  And then, just everybody would be a bunch of selfish idiots that buy into the AI and give up on their consciousness and get phased out.
[00:50:46.097 --> 00:50:51.061]  Because the globalists think they're going to get the real upgrade, where they're going to become gods.
[00:50:51.101 --> 00:50:51.702]  Of course they aren't.
[00:50:51.902 --> 00:50:55.045]  But believe me, what you get is not going to be that.
[00:50:57.486 --> 00:51:00.507]  The media will take this out of context and say, I'm insane, I made this up.
[00:51:00.607 --> 00:51:01.768]  But they don't really do that anymore.
[00:51:01.908 --> 00:51:05.149]  They do it 10 years ago because it's exactly what they're really saying.
[00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:06.970]  In fact, they're going public with it now.
[00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.170]  But I digress.
[00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.630]  Where was I?
[00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:10.111]  Oh, back on the timeline.
[00:51:12.652 --> 00:51:15.413]  So Hitler is funded by Western eugenicists.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:20.262]  The most popular place for eugenics in the world isn't even Germany or England or the U.S.
[00:51:20.302 --> 00:51:22.743]  It's Mexico, but that's another side issue.
[00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:25.824]  Incredible racism there by the quote upper classes.
[00:51:26.704 --> 00:51:30.686]  So I would begin saying there's a battle in all of our nations, good people and bad people.
[00:51:31.026 --> 00:51:34.468]  Your own Edward VIII, your own Qing, swore allegiance to Hitler.
[00:51:35.408 --> 00:51:37.249]  And I'll show photos and news articles about that.
[00:51:37.509 --> 00:51:40.470]  Queen Elizabeth howled Hitler herself as a young girl.
[00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:43.632]  He was going to be the new
[00:51:44.733 --> 00:51:46.656]  King of Europe and the European Union.
[00:51:46.716 --> 00:51:48.639]  I would then show London Guardian articles admitting that.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.622]  Even though we broke it decades before they did.
[00:51:52.205 --> 00:51:52.445]  So.
[00:51:54.568 --> 00:51:55.089]  I'd say so.
[00:51:55.189 --> 00:51:56.211]  I'm not saying England's bad.
[00:51:56.251 --> 00:51:56.611]  No, no, no.
[00:51:56.651 --> 00:51:57.192]  You're good.
[00:51:58.407 --> 00:52:02.289]  Because when it came, push came to shove, you had a secret treaty with Hitler.
[00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:06.411]  You were supposed to act like you were not really going to fight him, but stand down.
[00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:10.093]  But after Dunkirk and the rest of it, you decided to stand back up.
[00:52:10.873 --> 00:52:14.134]  And I'd go through the whole history of it, at least five hours, which they probably couldn't even give me.
[00:52:14.835 --> 00:52:15.795]  So it's a film we ought to make.
[00:52:15.835 --> 00:52:16.716]  It's a book ought to write.
[00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:18.937]  Oh, with Neil Strauss.
[00:52:19.097 --> 00:52:20.938]  Oh, but they don't want that book released.
[00:52:20.958 --> 00:52:22.178]  They're working very hard to stop that.
[00:52:23.019 --> 00:52:23.619]  But they will fail.
[00:52:27.389 --> 00:52:29.870]  And again, there's just too much knowledge just to lay it all out.
[00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:33.052]  But just to give you a broad stroke here, back to the timeline.
[00:52:33.372 --> 00:52:44.757]  First, I would sit there and address them as an anglophile crowd that's ashamed of their culture, and a very diverse crowd of people from all over the world who aren't ashamed of it.
[00:52:44.777 --> 00:52:46.178]  They're coming there to take part in it.
[00:52:46.758 --> 00:52:49.900]  The birthplace of real open society, the birthplace of real open discussion.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.180]  Now, here you are at Oxford.
[00:52:52.741 --> 00:52:55.302]  True modern liberalism, going back 800 years.
[00:52:55.382 --> 00:52:56.603]  I mean, here you are.
[00:52:58.047 --> 00:53:00.909]  600 we're gonna talk about technically, but 200 before that, Magna Carta.
[00:53:02.149 --> 00:53:21.120]  So you pull back, and you've got the British king, who's really a German, who's really a Transylvanian, sworn to Hitler, he's got an EU, that all fails, falls apart, the Brits decide to not capitulate, like their double agent had set it up, Neville Chamberlain, and things are off to the races.
[00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:23.401]  And we defeat Hitler.
[00:53:25.316 --> 00:53:30.177]  But the idea and Juncker, the head of the unelected EU, let that sink in, unelected.
[00:53:30.417 --> 00:53:33.458]  They come back, they're still in power, and they bring in the same system.
[00:53:33.658 --> 00:53:39.899]  And just like they were allied with Islam in World War II 70 years ago, they're allied with it again.
[00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:42.020]  The most oppressive forms of it.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.080]  And why not?
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.161]  It's a giant population to the south and to the east.
[00:53:48.755 --> 00:53:57.141]  Ready to control the critical crossroads of the Middle East into Asia, into Russia, into Eurasia, into Eastern Europe, into Western Europe, into the Mediterranean.
[00:53:59.023 --> 00:54:00.784]  It's risk being played globally.
[00:54:01.464 --> 00:54:02.825]  And see, that's just a very small part of it.
[00:54:03.346 --> 00:54:11.872]  And then you point out the censorship, the control, the attack on the family, all of it to debilitate you, all of it to make you weak, all of it to control you.
[00:54:12.092 --> 00:54:13.854]  Then you show the quotes with the globalists admitting
[00:54:14.795 --> 00:54:19.780]  How they've got this plan, how they are trying to end Europe, how they are trying to end Christendom, how they are trying to end the family.
[00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:26.747]  You show the Jesuit Pope up there pushing the whole thing, trying to bring that down as well while he lives behind his walls.
[00:54:28.028 --> 00:54:28.629]  You explain.
[00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:33.293]  We are fighting the 21st century version of Hitler.
[00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:35.516]  We're literally fighting the Nazi heir.
[00:54:37.452 --> 00:54:53.082]  But just as England refused Edward VIII, who was in Germany when World War II started and had to get out via Spain and move to the U.S., just as you refused your Nazism then, you must do it now, but you must understand the Nazis were only a prototype.
[00:54:54.795 --> 00:54:55.256]  Test!
[00:54:55.736 --> 00:55:12.814]  And that Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley and the UN and all of them admitted and wrote books about the master plan to develop the computers, to merge with them, to exterminate the population, to transcend our humanity and to become a new species and the decision was made on chalkboards!
[00:55:14.434 --> 00:55:21.442]  More than a hundred years ago, and that we're now living the aftershocks of that today, and that it's not that technology's evil.
[00:55:22.003 --> 00:55:32.175]  It's that in all of it is the handiwork and the fingerprints and the Trojan horses and the spirit of the people that created Hitler as a side project!
[00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:36.131]  And then you begin to understand.
[00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:46.354]  And it's all oversimplified here, but when you talk about the darkest hour, and you talk about Winston Churchill, and you talk about America, America and England created Hitler.
[00:55:47.895 --> 00:55:50.456]  We wrongfully launched World War I. All of it.
[00:55:51.216 --> 00:55:55.158]  Hitler was horrible, but out of that we finally said no and turned against it.
[00:55:55.478 --> 00:55:56.718]  And who were we allied with?
[00:55:57.659 --> 00:55:58.079]  Russia.
[00:55:59.439 --> 00:55:59.759]  England.
[00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:03.721]  The United States against the Axis powers in World War II.
[00:56:05.578 --> 00:56:06.105]  And we won!
[00:56:07.443 --> 00:56:20.692]  And again, we're against an EU global power that was literally set up by Adolf Hitler and Juncker's grandfather with a plan to put Edward VIII on the throne of the EU that would expand.
[00:56:20.732 --> 00:56:24.014]  They were going to put poison in the water, fluoride to lower your fertility.
[00:56:24.234 --> 00:56:28.857]  They were going to put forced vaccines with added pathogens to dumb the population down.
[00:56:28.897 --> 00:56:29.998]  They called it soft kill.
[00:56:30.198 --> 00:56:31.159]  That's a Nazi term.
[00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:36.983]  This was all the Rockefellers having a big powerful industrial country they could use as an experiment.
[00:56:37.744 --> 00:56:39.988]  But today Russia isn't Stalinist run!
[00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:45.792]  It's becoming Christian and wants to be allied with us against radical Islam.
[00:56:46.012 --> 00:56:51.935]  So we're facing the very same EU, allied with the Muslims, allied with the technocracy that created it.
[00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:53.936]  The EU calls itself a technocracy.
[00:56:54.376 --> 00:56:55.477]  And we are in that fight.
[00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:56.897]  So we tolerate the left.
[00:56:57.158 --> 00:56:58.238]  We think they're mentally ill.
[00:56:58.378 --> 00:56:59.279]  Those are their minions.
[00:56:59.319 --> 00:57:00.139]  Those are their fodder.
[00:57:00.359 --> 00:57:01.340]  Those are their victims.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.260]  Those are their servants.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.361]  Those are their minions.
[00:57:03.401 --> 00:57:07.663]  Those are the sad people that were weak and programmed.
[00:57:08.123 --> 00:57:09.264]  With high-tech psychology.
[00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:20.471]  But we have history, we have science, we have facts, and we know we're facing a eugenics breakaway civilization plan that's actually gotten off the ground to a great extent.
[00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:25.875]  And we're all facing imminent doom within 25 to 30 years if we don't stop it.
[00:57:26.175 --> 00:57:37.763]  And Elon Musk is now telling you exactly what I'm telling you, because there's patriots of the Pentagon working with him and others to try to warn people and get them to awaken to this and build a new human future that Trump and other nationalists are pushing.
[00:57:38.243 --> 00:57:42.751]  We sent out the emergency transmission, the people listened, and now we're beginning to turn the tide!
[00:57:42.891 --> 00:57:43.753]  But we need you!
[00:57:47.873 --> 00:57:52.336]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:57:52.557 --> 00:57:57.260]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[00:57:57.861 --> 00:58:03.705]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[00:58:04.205 --> 00:58:16.715]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[00:58:17.475 --> 00:58:19.036]  Unlike other systems.
[00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:24.560]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.181]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.083]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:58:28.403 --> 00:58:29.604]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:58:29.784 --> 00:58:30.825]  Doesn't smoke marijuana.
[00:58:31.185 --> 00:58:32.206]  Doesn't drink anything.
[00:58:32.406 --> 00:58:33.886]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:36.007]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:58:36.027 --> 00:58:37.808]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:58:38.168 --> 00:58:40.769]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:41.669]  This is insane.
[00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:43.690]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:46.510]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[00:58:46.951 --> 00:58:48.471]  He says, this is totally free.
[00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:50.332]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[00:58:50.352 --> 00:58:52.212]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[00:58:53.093 --> 00:58:59.014]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[00:58:59.254 --> 00:59:00.595]  All just moderate dose.
[00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:10.109]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:12.531]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:13.711]  But thank you for committing.
[00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:20.605]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[00:59:20.985 --> 00:59:23.588]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:59:23.608 --> 00:59:28.373]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[00:59:28.853 --> 00:59:38.103]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[00:59:38.443 --> 00:59:39.765]  It's called reap what you sow.
[00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:52.329]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:57.650]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:07.832 --> 01:00:13.033]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[01:00:13.273 --> 01:00:15.094]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.274 --> 01:00:17.154]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:35.289]  You know, in the last segment, and I'm going to combine this segment with that last segment when we posted on YouTube and Facebook and other places, I got into the science fiction dreams of the British and U.S.
[01:00:35.389 --> 01:00:39.291]  elite that sold eugenics.
[01:00:39.331 --> 01:00:43.972]  Japan, Mexico, they all bought into it.
[01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:49.834]  And it was an idea of how to make your people better, how to make your IQs higher, how to make people be smarter and live long.
[01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:53.250]  That's kind of the outside of what eugenics is.
[01:00:53.631 --> 01:01:02.036]  But really it was a study of what humans are going to turn into transhumanism beyond breeding, but through merging with scientific systems.
[01:01:02.656 --> 01:01:09.521]  And that's because royalty and other elites had seen the problems of their own inbreeding, taking their genetic strengths and it becoming weak.
[01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:23.219]  And they saw the native wild intelligence that would sprout up, the idiot genius as they would call it, in the general public from time to time, and they feared that, but at the same time wanted to capture it.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:33.789]  So they wanted to go in with mass culling operations and dumbing down operations, but also have testing very early on to target the savants and the other wizards that
[01:01:34.844 --> 01:01:43.672]  They want to then recruit into their systems, but they don't want them to ever challenge their duchy or challenge their fiefdom.
[01:01:44.252 --> 01:01:50.358]  They don't even want viceroys that rule in their steds or romantic legates that speak of the name of Caesar.
[01:01:51.158 --> 01:01:52.059]  They don't want that.
[01:01:52.119 --> 01:01:54.541]  They don't believe in honor-based systems.
[01:01:54.982 --> 01:02:00.827]  They believe in pure hate, pure cunning, pure overthrow, just pure savage evil that never sleeps.
[01:02:04.286 --> 01:02:12.353]  And so they have built this total system of surveillance, and they say, oh, we need a world government to stop the atomic weapons we deployed and built.
[01:02:12.893 --> 01:02:19.598]  Oh, we need a world government to stop the genetic engineering, as they wildly go forward with the cross-human animal species and all this other dangerous stuff.
[01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:25.083]  And then as these disasters, both real and manufactured, unfold,
[01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:28.855]  Be they nuclear wars, mass plagues, you name it.
[01:02:29.376 --> 01:02:34.523]  The argument is going to then be in that whole systematic system.
[01:02:36.035 --> 01:02:59.497]  That we must all upload ourselves into a giant hive mind, hive consciousness, and we can have our personal selves, and even our bodies, and avatars, but the avatars will finally, again, not have a carbon footprint, that's why this is all moving, and Bill Gates has admitted this, and so that you will be pressured into an avatar, and promised all these incredible things,
[01:03:01.067 --> 01:03:24.970]  You promised all these great cultural enrichments that you're going to get, that you're going to be part of, if, if you will simply go along with their larger worldview that is to dumb people down, keep them in the dark, only give them backdoored technology with Trojan horses, poison them and get rid of them, you're saving the earth from this horrible scourge.
[01:03:26.874 --> 01:03:28.215]  And so that's the plan.
[01:03:28.335 --> 01:03:30.457]  And I've had globalist people say, why don't you tape them?
[01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:30.998]  Why don't you talk?
[01:03:31.258 --> 01:03:32.799]  Why don't you, why don't you release the info?
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.283]  They say it all in books and videos and articles and public statements now.
[01:03:37.884 --> 01:03:42.207]  And if something's off record and somebody says, Alex, I'll tell you how stuff really works.
[01:03:43.569 --> 01:03:46.631]  Mr. Smart Guy, you're never going to save the general public.
[01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:47.592]  They're never going to wake up.
[01:03:47.652 --> 01:03:48.253]  They don't want to.
[01:03:48.273 --> 01:03:49.354]  That's why they're the way they are.
[01:03:49.614 --> 01:03:51.596]  The fact that you're interested in this and the fact that you know
[01:03:53.206 --> 01:04:01.030]  Make sure you get on a plane and come up here to New York City or come to London and we're ready to hire you right now.
[01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:05.872]  And then it gets down to money and they're like, you know...
[01:04:07.401 --> 01:04:11.782]  I'm the deputy head of this organization, and I'm not making $5 million a year, Mr. Jones.
[01:04:12.063 --> 01:04:17.604]  And I think this is really a good deal for you, but if it's not just about the money, you know, you could do a lot more on the inside.
[01:04:17.684 --> 01:04:22.046]  I mean, look, $1 million a year, $3 million a year, $5 million a year, they know potential.
[01:04:22.366 --> 01:04:23.326]  That's why they're in charge.
[01:04:23.366 --> 01:04:25.447]  And I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm some great dude.
[01:04:26.147 --> 01:04:30.628]  I'm mentally ill like Trump, they say, because I don't want to screw everybody over.
[01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:34.350]  I want to keep having grandmas and grandpas and little babies and everything else.
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:38.691]  And if people want to become cyborgs or chop their genitals off and say they're a woman, you can do that.
[01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:39.311]  But here's the deal.
[01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:43.092]  You're not going to brainwash all the kids and everybody else to make the world so ugly.
[01:04:43.372 --> 01:04:48.054]  We then accept this when really it's a giant Trojan horse to get us all to kill ourselves, basically.
[01:04:48.434 --> 01:04:54.556]  And we think we're all joining some big robot system so we can be part of the elite and, you know, be at the real country club up in the cloud.
[01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:55.456]  Uh-uh, baby.
[01:04:57.378 --> 01:05:00.180]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.363]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:05:04.763 --> 01:05:07.705]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.086]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:05:10.647 --> 01:05:15.050]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:17.451]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:05:17.731 --> 01:05:24.116]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:05:24.736 --> 01:05:31.964]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:05:32.926 --> 01:05:37.591]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:44.979]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:50.083]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:05:50.523 --> 01:05:53.446]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:16.111]  Burning with the truth.
[01:06:16.611 --> 01:06:18.172]  Burning with the desire to warn you.
[01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:20.073]  Burning with victory!
[01:06:22.994 --> 01:06:27.997]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:44.185]  Earlier I laid out a gestalt of the admitted stated plans of almost every tech billionaire and the globalists that fund them.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:59.427]  And it is a plan to bring in world government, to poison you, to dumb you down, to distract you, and to make this world, the real world, so ugly that you accept being euthanized with the belief that your body is going to be uploaded into this wondrous cloud.
[01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:02.909]  And that is their actual plan.
[01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:05.470]  A digital hell they're creating.
[01:07:06.601 --> 01:07:12.387]  Just as Lucifer got one-third of the angels to go with him, and then all it created was a nightmare system.
[01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:19.755]  Now whether you believe the devil existed or not, they're building a system right out of the mind of the old serpent himself.
[01:07:21.557 --> 01:07:25.981]  Everything you see Elon Musk talking about today, I've been talking about for 20 years.
[01:07:26.782 --> 01:07:29.185]  Because it's all in the source documents.
[01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.452]  This is your final warning, my friends.
[01:07:34.212 --> 01:07:42.960]  The globalists think you're dumb and think you're stupid and told me to my face many times that I'm a fool and that you are profane and don't even deserve to know this.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:54.550]  I'll tell you this, I tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton yesterday, one of her reported pervert buddies, and I said, this is your elitism, this is your power, this is your grace, this is your beauty, this is your purity.
[01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:57.452]  I don't want to be within a trillion miles of you.
[01:08:03.502 --> 01:08:15.869]  If you go to my Twitter account, RealAlexJones, I tweeted out yesterday morning, and it just shows the evil in her eyes, and it just shows you the evil in her actions, and who these people are, and what they stand for.
[01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:30.598]  Now before I go any further, the Twitter's RealAlexJones, before I go any further, I didn't get to all this, but I will coming up, and out of Jerome Corsi's coming in with the secrets of QAnon, I'm gonna have him host for two segments, but before I go any further here,
[01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:32.759]  Look at all these other headlines.
[01:08:33.139 --> 01:08:35.640]  Trump ignores DOJ warning once FISA Memorandum is released.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.161]  Oh, the terrorists will get us.
[01:08:37.861 --> 01:08:39.062]  Oh, don't release it, please.
[01:08:39.122 --> 01:08:43.064]  First it was nothing, then it was made up, then it wasn't important, and then blah, blah, blah.
[01:08:43.364 --> 01:08:48.207]  It's the total proof of the collusion of Obama, Hillary, the Democratic Party, all of them.
[01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:52.751]  Another one, amid turmoil Trump seeks to reset with State of the Union.
[01:08:52.771 --> 01:08:53.552]  They don't want to reset.
[01:08:53.772 --> 01:08:56.193]  They want to kill our prosperity and control the economy.
[01:08:56.753 --> 01:08:59.815]  Senators press Podesta and other Democrats about dossier.
[01:09:00.115 --> 01:09:06.338]  Hillary and Podesta, the articles on Infowars.com have been told.
[01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:09.339]  You have two weeks to turn those documents over.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:18.804]  Continuing, Trump amnesty offer intended to expose Democrat cynicism.
[01:09:19.844 --> 01:09:22.325]  Yeah, when he said, okay, I'll go ahead and legalize all these people.
[01:09:22.345 --> 01:09:23.965]  They went, no, we want totally open borders.
[01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:26.226]  Anybody can come here and you're a white supremacist.
[01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:27.586]  They want the end of the borders, folks.
[01:09:28.186 --> 01:09:28.806]  That's what this is.
[01:09:29.886 --> 01:09:31.047]  You see, they took that as weakness.
[01:09:34.888 --> 01:09:35.328]  Oh, look at this.
[01:09:35.428 --> 01:09:41.689]  Migrants in Italy will be taught they shouldn't beat women when they say no.
[01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:44.790]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:49.071]  Liberal California councilmen and teachers
[01:09:51.294 --> 01:09:55.397]  Tell students, military are dumb bleeps and the lowest of our low.
[01:09:56.978 --> 01:10:00.821]  Bernie Sanders acknowledges Democrats forced government shutdown.
[01:10:00.881 --> 01:10:02.722]  It was the right thing to do, do, to do!
[01:10:02.742 --> 01:10:09.307]  Because he wants to, like a Nazi, hurt 1.8 million people and 800,000 children in DACA.
[01:10:09.567 --> 01:10:15.011]  He wants to, even though he just said legalize them, he's just, oh, he had to shut it down because he was going to legalize them.
[01:10:15.071 --> 01:10:16.912]  I mean, we can't let people know that.
[01:10:16.932 --> 01:10:19.554]  And then they go, oh, he's breaking his promise.
[01:10:20.765 --> 01:10:21.606]  Never broke his promise.
[01:10:21.686 --> 01:10:28.311]  He said, if you can really prove you're here and legal and been here a long time and were a kid, but then you've been deported a bunch of times and are a criminal and can't prove it, you're gone!
[01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:29.232]  Wow!
[01:10:29.552 --> 01:10:30.513]  Common sense, man!
[01:10:32.334 --> 01:10:34.716]  So that's just some of the news.
[01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:38.059]  Trump tells Piers Morgan, I wouldn't say I'm a feminist, but rather for everyone.
[01:10:38.619 --> 01:10:40.781]  Yeah, you're pro-human!
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:48.183]  But meanwhile, unhinged Michael Moore assails Trump as unfit narcissist, sociopath, threat to humanity.
[01:10:48.424 --> 01:10:51.906]  Now, I'm going to go to this special report by Paul Watson.
[01:10:52.846 --> 01:10:57.529]  We're coming back with a detailed one that we haven't aired yet, an interview I did Friday that hasn't aired yet with Milo.
[01:10:58.089 --> 01:11:02.172]  Major studies out, why are conservatives on average so much better looking than liberals?
[01:11:02.532 --> 01:11:05.314]  And why do they also give more to charity and steal less?
[01:11:06.294 --> 01:11:08.916]  And the answer is, they're not liberals.
[01:11:09.797 --> 01:11:10.838]  They flipped everything.
[01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:12.800]  Classical liberals set up our country.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.443]  They're pro-gun, they're for low taxes, they're for do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[01:11:16.803 --> 01:11:19.545]  The left are control freaks that want to run every aspect of your life.
[01:11:19.785 --> 01:11:20.446]  Here's that report.
[01:11:21.567 --> 01:11:23.308]  Political activists and journalists, yeah.
[01:11:23.368 --> 01:11:24.830]  Not noted for their visual appeal.
[01:11:25.976 --> 01:11:28.697]  But now science has confirmed what we knew all along.
[01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:31.398]  Conservatives are way hotter than liberals.
[01:11:31.478 --> 01:11:39.382]  A new study published by Cambridge University Press finds that conservative men and women tend to be physically more attractive than their political opponents.
[01:11:39.442 --> 01:11:46.205]  We find that attractive individuals are more likely to identify with the Republican Party and more likely to be conservative, the researchers concluded.
[01:11:46.225 --> 01:11:50.947]  So they used huge data sets and all the participants were ranked by other people on their hotness.
[01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:53.288]  And conservatives clearly came out on top.
[01:11:53.368 --> 01:12:00.653]  This confirms a previous UCLA study which found more feminine, less manly looking women were more likely to be conservatives.
[01:12:00.773 --> 01:12:04.515]  Even arch-feminist Lindy West admits that conservative women are prettier.
[01:12:04.555 --> 01:12:09.718]  Remember that scene in The Shining where he kisses the hot naked chick who then turns into some kind of zombie witch?
[01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:13.780]  Well scientists have now confirmed that communism has the exact same effect on women.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.443]  Turns out being a resentful snarling loser manifests itself physically.
[01:12:18.763 --> 01:12:23.688]  Why do you think fat social justice warriors are constantly trying to ban offensive Halloween outfits?
[01:12:23.808 --> 01:12:27.111]  Sexy, slender women in tight-fitting costumes everywhere.
[01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:28.332]  Yeah, it's not rocket science.
[01:12:28.392 --> 01:12:28.853]  I'm triggered.
[01:12:28.893 --> 01:12:31.075]  Why do you think they tried to ban beach body ads?
[01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:32.196]  Same reason.
[01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:35.699]  The Alberta Youth Communist League.
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:47.474]  Now, I'm not saying these people are ugly, but when they try to take selfies, their phones spontaneously combust.
[01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:50.136]  Look at these anti-Milo protesters at UCLA.
[01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:58.103]  If they put as much effort into grooming as they do silencing free speech, maybe they wouldn't look like Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow's bastard love child.
[01:12:58.143 --> 01:12:58.724]  Just saying.
[01:12:58.944 --> 01:13:00.505]  Look at the girl on the right.
[01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:01.306]  Get it?
[01:13:01.746 --> 01:13:02.447]  On the right?
[01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:10.073]  Hello, darkness, my old friend.
[01:13:11.365 --> 01:13:14.647]  She's got less armpit hair than Verne Troyer's got head hair.
[01:13:14.747 --> 01:13:18.630]  As for the girl on the left, not even a soy boy is going to want to touch that spaghet.
[01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:21.932]  Somebody toucha my spaghet!
[01:13:22.713 --> 01:13:24.814]  I don't even know what that means.
[01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:27.396]  No one knows what it means, but it's provocative.
[01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:28.517]  No it's not.
[01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:29.718]  It's getting the people going.
[01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:32.599]  Shut up, Hillary girl versus Lena Dunham.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.461]  Let's just say, I'm with her.
[01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:36.642]  How to be anti-feminist woman on YouTube?
[01:13:36.802 --> 01:13:37.102]  Hot!
[01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:37.903]  Hater the women!
[01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:38.963]  Nearly a teenager!
[01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:41.164]  Unhealthy pathological need for male approval!
[01:13:41.224 --> 01:13:43.345]  How to be a feminist woman on YouTube?
[01:13:43.806 --> 01:13:44.186]  Ugly!
[01:13:44.426 --> 01:13:45.406]  Hate hot women!
[01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:46.927]  Hate young hot women!
[01:13:47.307 --> 01:13:48.468]  Unhealthy need for hair dye!
[01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:53.690]  Kill Donald Trump, and then it says kill Mike Pence, and then it says it's guillotine time, bitches!
[01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.672]  But Paul, I can give you a million examples of liberals who aren't ugly!
[01:13:56.772 --> 01:13:58.013]  Yeah, they're celebrities.
[01:13:58.153 --> 01:14:00.794]  If they weren't liberals, they wouldn't have a career.
[01:14:00.874 --> 01:14:02.955]  I'm talking about activists and journalists.
[01:14:03.055 --> 01:14:04.035]  Like this woman.
[01:14:04.075 --> 01:14:08.477]  Now, I know they say, stand up for your rights, but in this case, probably not a good idea.
[01:14:08.737 --> 01:14:13.699]  Why do you think the vast majority of the journalists exposed as sex pervs have been lefties?
[01:14:13.719 --> 01:14:19.481]  Because they're ugly, they hate themselves, and are therefore very unsuccessful at attracting women in the normal way.
[01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:23.103]  I mean, the elephant man gets more right swipes on Tinder than Sam Chris.
[01:14:23.403 --> 01:14:24.744]  But Paul, stop being such a bigot.
[01:14:24.784 --> 01:14:26.426]  People are beautiful at any size.
[01:14:26.506 --> 01:14:31.751]  Unless you disagree with their politics, in which case they're an obese tyrant or an emaciated skank.
[01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:35.514]  Unless you digitally remove their makeup and then you all have a meltdown.
[01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:39.457]  Now we cross live to CNN for a special report by me.
[01:14:39.758 --> 01:14:45.122]  Is radical feminism a refuge for fat, ugly women who can't attract high-value men?
[01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:48.165]  The stereotype generally holds true because they look like
[01:14:48.445 --> 01:14:49.466]  Swamp donkeys.
[01:14:49.546 --> 01:14:50.786]  Kind of sad, honestly.
[01:14:50.806 --> 01:14:54.188]  Speaking of CNN, everyone's mad at them for promoting cuckoldry.
[01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:57.911]  But a study in France found that leftists were more likely to be into it.
[01:14:57.931 --> 01:15:03.113]  So CNN's only appealing to its core audience, who in many cases are quite literally cucks.
[01:15:03.594 --> 01:15:04.334]  So there you have it.
[01:15:04.434 --> 01:15:07.356]  It's not my opinion that conservatives are hotter than leftists.
[01:15:07.656 --> 01:15:08.417]  It's science.
[01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.618]  It works, bitches.
[01:15:11.994 --> 01:15:14.075]  All right, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:17.678]  I'm going to come back and play Milo's report that I shot in here Friday that we haven't aired yet.
[01:15:17.698 --> 01:15:21.100]  But just briefly, the crew's reminding me, this is a big operation.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.502]  I haven't plugged one time I get so obsessed with the news.
[01:15:23.922 --> 01:15:27.865]  We have great products at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:29.926]  We have the ultimate turmeric product.

[01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.008]  It's selling so fast.
[01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.449]  I'm going to have to end that special.
[01:15:34.509 --> 01:15:35.730]  BrainForce, 25% off.
[01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:39.492]  Please help support the InfoWars and get great products with our t-shirts, books, videos.
[01:15:39.993 --> 01:15:40.913]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:42.415 --> 01:15:48.064]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:15:48.084 --> 01:15:50.809]  And again, you make this all possible.
[01:15:50.869 --> 01:15:54.194]  We'll be back in the Secrets of QAnon with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:15:54.415 --> 01:15:54.855]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:06.403]  I don't want to just sit here and give you the standard pitch for our new product bodies, which is the ultimate turmeric formula out there on the market from our deep research.
[01:16:06.423 --> 01:16:17.207]  The purity, the concentration, the quality, and the other synergistic organic compounds that are added to it so that it's bioavailable and gets into your bloodstream.
[01:16:18.387 --> 01:16:22.188]  I've got a big list of the facts here, and I guess I'll go over some of it for you.
[01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:24.009]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:30.007]  Talking to Paul Watson about two years ago, I said, which of the products do you use and like the most?
[01:16:30.607 --> 01:16:33.508]  And he said, listen, what I really want is a turmeric product.
[01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:35.529]  He goes, you've seen the studies.
[01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.489]  You know what it does.
[01:16:36.929 --> 01:16:38.170]  You know what it's been proven to do.
[01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:38.970]  It's crazy.
[01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:44.092]  And I've read a lot of them out there are adulterated or watered down.
[01:16:44.112 --> 01:16:45.152]  I said, well, let me look into it.
[01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:51.454]  And so it then took us off and on several years to finally come out with this because I
[01:16:53.294 --> 01:16:56.381]  I want to bring you the very best product we can get.
[01:16:57.423 --> 01:17:00.329]  I want it to be what myself and my family take.
[01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:02.033]  And we've done it.
[01:17:03.362 --> 01:17:18.033]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years for its known therapeutic effects and is the subject of well over 10,000 published scientific articles and studies.
[01:17:18.254 --> 01:17:25.039]  Plain turmeric root contains on average about 3% of the active ingredient, the curcuminoids.
[01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:32.806]  But our powerful blend contains turmeric extract containing 95% curcuminoids.
[01:17:33.307 --> 01:17:34.808]  Did you hear what I'm saying?
[01:17:36.029 --> 01:17:39.613]  Most of the brands out there are at 3% or less and are adulterated.
[01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:42.276]  This is 95%.
[01:17:43.357 --> 01:17:47.541]  Body Ease Ultimate Turmeric Formula is also fortified with peppermint.
[01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:55.252]  Pepparine, many studies have shown, helps accelerate the absorption of the tumeric compounds, the curcuminoids, in the body.
[01:17:55.712 --> 01:17:57.853]  Now let's get to Boswellia.
[01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:03.856]  Boswellia is an ayurvedic herb that has been studied for its anti-inflammatory properties.
[01:18:04.396 --> 01:18:12.219]  In fact, the active ingredient, boswellic acid, has been shown in studies to inhibit one of the enzymes that actually cause the inflammation response.
[01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:17.702]  BodyEase also contains the organic herbs, spirulamate, sage, lemon balm, and thyme.
[01:18:18.462 --> 01:18:25.247]  As an added bonus, all of the ingredients we just listed contain very potent antioxidants.
[01:18:25.547 --> 01:18:34.133]  In fact, turmeric's curcuminoids are some of the most potent and naturally occurring free radical scavenging antioxidants available on the market.
[01:18:34.393 --> 01:18:39.016]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to m4restore.com and go to the bodies page.
[01:18:39.036 --> 01:18:41.838]  You can actually see the video the TV viewers can see right now.
[01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:46.680]  If you look at our turmeric product, it's bright yellow-orange, the way it's supposed to be.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.461]  That's because the active compound in curcuminoids is orange.
[01:18:52.061 --> 01:19:00.524]  So again, it's not just the concentration, it's not just the studies we've done, it's not just the test, it's how vibrant and bright our product is.
[01:19:00.884 --> 01:19:03.285]  The recommended MSRP is $59.95 and it's a great deal.
[01:19:05.626 --> 01:19:07.207]  Because of the quality and concentration.

[01:19:59.654 --> 01:20:02.516]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:02.556 --> 01:20:03.376]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:03.436 --> 01:20:05.717]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.979 --> 01:20:22.339]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:20:22.379 --> 01:20:24.020]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.020]  If you just tuned in, you missed it.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:33.941]  Last segment, I played an excerpt of a video Paul Joseph Watson put out on Friday of last week.
[01:20:34.102 --> 01:20:36.042]  Sexy, hot conservatives.
[01:20:37.642 --> 01:20:46.884]  And it shows study after study after study, even done at major liberal universities, by think tanks, you name it, that all over the world, not just in the West,
[01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:58.033]  People identify conservatives, libertarians, as handsomer, sexier, better looking, more successful, better dressed.
[01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:04.939]  These are in blind studies where they're showing people that aren't public figures, but who are conservatives versus liberal.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.542]  And that's because they have inverted the terms and inverted the names.
[01:21:10.263 --> 01:21:15.366]  It's conservatives of the modern age of the classical liberals, like a Thomas Jefferson.
[01:21:16.006 --> 01:21:27.633]  The modern liberals are the authoritarians and the control freaks and basically the followers, and so that's why they again appear, when they call themselves a modern liberal, as so rat-like.
[01:21:27.974 --> 01:21:35.038]  But let's go to Milo Yiannopoulos' breakdown on these latest studies as well, when he joined me for a tape
[01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:36.905]  Interview we did last Friday.
[01:21:38.069 --> 01:21:42.332]  You were on the radio with me a few days ago and you had a point you wanted to get to during a break.
[01:21:42.372 --> 01:21:43.052]  We never got to it.
[01:21:43.072 --> 01:21:48.375]  You said, Alex, let's talk about the fact that conservatives in studies all over the world are better looking than liberals.
[01:21:48.435 --> 01:21:51.357]  And I don't think of myself as some great suave looking guy like you.
[01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:52.898]  I mean, you are suave looking.
[01:21:52.918 --> 01:21:57.120]  No, but you are unaware because you're you of your raw sexual energy.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.921]  So you've got the same thing Trump has.
[01:21:58.941 --> 01:22:05.145]  You've got that kind of like alpha male aura, which just has women and gay men, you know, wilting in your presence.
[01:22:05.165 --> 01:22:05.845]  You're being too nice.
[01:22:09.108 --> 01:22:13.732]  Compared to an average leftist mob, I am at least somewhat healthy and virile when I talk.
[01:22:13.772 --> 01:22:14.613]  You're put together.
[01:22:14.673 --> 01:22:22.880]  You're clean and well-groomed, which puts you head and shoulders above a lot of the leftist activists.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.202]  I remember going to leftist events ten years ago and they looked like hell.
[01:22:25.262 --> 01:22:27.024]  Now they look like half-dead zombies.
[01:22:27.424 --> 01:22:28.945]  So we're not being mean when we say this.
[01:22:28.965 --> 01:22:29.826]  Statistics have come out.
[01:22:29.846 --> 01:22:30.727]  We'll show an article.
[01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:34.268]  Well, we can be mean, but we're also on the right side of science.
[01:22:34.328 --> 01:22:35.408]  I'm perfectly happy to be mean.
[01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:43.290]  Well, we're into it right now, but they're like six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely to purchase a single and not give it to charity, called conservatives.
[01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:46.531]  I mean, these are really some horrible people, and they seem to be degrading.
[01:22:46.811 --> 01:22:48.052]  So you wanted to get into that point.
[01:22:48.112 --> 01:22:55.854]  Give us your little nugget of why they're so culturally out of control, anti-free speech, but also physically ugly.
[01:22:57.114 --> 01:23:03.057]  I believe that Roald Dahl was right in his introduction to the Twits that you can see a person's character on their face.
[01:23:03.177 --> 01:23:15.843]  And Roald Dahl at the beginning of the Twits says, um, it doesn't matter if you've got wonky teeth and wonky eyes and stick out whatever, um, if you are a good person, your, uh, your goodness, your joy will shine through in your face.
[01:23:16.423 --> 01:23:24.071]  If, on the other hand, you may be, on the face of it, handsome, but inside your heart is dark and evil and wicked, it will show.
[01:23:24.111 --> 01:23:26.414]  And over the years, it will show more and more and more.
[01:23:26.794 --> 01:23:35.283]  Well, the science is divided, to say the least, on whether left-wing politics make people unattractive or unattractive people are more drawn to left-wing politics.
[01:23:35.703 --> 01:23:51.272]  Left-wingers themselves say that people who don't subscribe to traditional beauty standards or society's body norms are more likely to be driven to political philosophies that make excuses for them, which is why you see in so many liberal arts colleges fat studies emerging.
[01:23:51.553 --> 01:23:58.457]  These skinny white liberals who want to justify the terrible lifestyle choices of their fellow left-wingers.
[01:23:58.797 --> 01:24:03.220]  But more and more and more, regardless of the direction of causality, studies are coming out.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.422]  This most recent one from Cambridge University.
[01:24:05.442 --> 01:24:07.503]  It could not be a more venerated institution.
[01:24:07.964 --> 01:24:25.997]  More and more studies are coming out demonstrating that when you blind people to the identity of a pile of people and ask them to sort the pictures into attractive and unattractive, you will get right-wingers over here on the attractive pile and left-wingers over on the unattractive pile.
[01:24:26.717 --> 01:24:29.218]  This holds for politicians, it holds for private citizens.
[01:24:29.418 --> 01:24:30.798]  Right-wingers are hotter.
[01:24:30.898 --> 01:24:33.319]  Science has proven it over and over and over again.
[01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:42.442]  This latest study that came out from Cambridge this month is just the last study to re-establish what I think we all know from having seen it in our own lives.
[01:24:43.423 --> 01:24:49.511]  Republicans don't say this kind of thing to be mean, although I'm perfectly happy to be mean on occasion if the science and the numbers justify it.
[01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:58.062]  It does seem to be the case, though, that people who are unhappy with themselves, with how they look, are often drawn to left-wing causes and left-wing political positions.
[01:24:58.422 --> 01:25:10.172]  It could be something to do with the fact that people who have low self-esteem want other people to suffer like they're suffering, or people who think they're unattractive or think that they are overweight and aren't prepared to do anything about their condition.
[01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:16.837]  They don't want to groom themselves a little more carefully, wear slightly more flattering clothes, or have a bit more discipline in their diets and exercise regime.
[01:25:17.198 --> 01:25:24.624]  Instead of taking personal responsibility for their situation, would rather blame the world for imposing unrealistic beauty standards on them.
[01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:33.650]  Certainly we know that Conservatives, Republicans and Libertarians have a greater affinity for independence and for personal responsibility.
[01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:42.295]  Maybe it's the case that there are just as many ugly people on the right as on the left, but the ugly people on the left who are unwilling to take personal responsibility for their
[01:25:44.797 --> 01:25:49.919]  We don't know.
[01:25:50.399 --> 01:25:54.081]  More studies and more science and more speculation is sure to follow on this.
[01:25:54.421 --> 01:25:58.323]  One thing we do know for sure, if you see someone hot in the street, they're much more likely to be Republican.
[01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:09.396]  Someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:26:09.796 --> 01:26:16.982]  This young generation, who scream words like fascist, will actually themselves become the fascists.
[01:26:17.242 --> 01:26:19.124]  You guys are the fascists!
[01:26:19.464 --> 01:26:20.685]  You're all the fascists!
[01:26:20.705 --> 01:26:21.947]  You're a white male!
[01:26:22.047 --> 01:26:25.730]  I just wish that somebody would create like some kind of a safe!
[01:26:31.906 --> 01:26:34.970]  He gets to do whatever he wants to in this space, right?
[01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:36.411]  You need to get out.
[01:26:36.451 --> 01:26:37.292]  I actually don't.
[01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:42.878]  Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here?
[01:26:42.959 --> 01:26:46.142]  I need some muscle over here!
[01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:50.067]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:26:56.750 --> 01:27:04.036]  So the question is, are social justice warriors mentally ill, or are they just stupid?
[01:27:04.356 --> 01:27:10.941]  When your emotions control your actions, it affects not only yourself, but the people around you.
[01:27:15.004 --> 01:27:20.046]  There are over 7 million mentally ill and emotionally disturbed children in America.
[01:27:20.106 --> 01:27:21.487]  This has to be a joke!
[01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:24.948]  I can't believe this is happening!
[01:27:24.968 --> 01:27:28.229]  I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself and I'm not kidding!
[01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:29.670]  You better f***ing fix this right now!
[01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:30.670]  Get the f*** out of here!
[01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:32.691]  He's losing control of himself.
[01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:33.632]  Get your phone away!
[01:27:33.852 --> 01:27:34.172]  Why?
[01:27:34.212 --> 01:27:35.092]  Quit recording!
[01:27:35.112 --> 01:27:37.373]  The madder he gets, the worse it becomes.
[01:27:37.393 --> 01:27:38.634]  Get the f*** away!
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.763]  You couldn't help interrupting, could you?
[01:27:43.803 --> 01:27:50.272]  You added nothing to that conversation.
[01:27:50.312 --> 01:27:53.336]  These are some of Tommy's drawings that the school sent over.
[01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:56.059]  There's an awful lot of hate in them.
[01:28:10.894 --> 01:28:11.854]  So the facts are in.
[01:28:11.914 --> 01:28:12.915]  It's a scientific fact.
[01:28:13.275 --> 01:28:26.880]  Liberals are better looking than authoritarians, but authoritarians now call themselves liberal to control Western civilization while they attack classical Western liberal values that come out of the West.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:37.805]  They are authoritarians, and then they have a lot of camp followers who are pseudo-intellectuals, very, very dumbed down, very, very angry, many more times likely to steal, to virtue signal and not give to charity.
[01:28:38.425 --> 01:28:42.469]  It's all out there, even in top psychology publications, written by liberals.
[01:28:42.509 --> 01:28:44.150]  They ask, why are we such bad people?
[01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:46.112]  Because you're impostors, you're not liberals.
[01:28:46.332 --> 01:28:48.955]  We'll be back with Dr. Jerome Corsi and the secrets of QAnon.
[01:28:58.317 --> 01:29:02.778]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:29:02.998 --> 01:29:07.679]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:29:08.299 --> 01:29:14.140]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:27.142]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleet.
[01:29:27.922 --> 01:29:36.568]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:29:36.588 --> 01:29:38.510]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:39.951]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:41.252]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:29:41.452 --> 01:29:42.653]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:29:42.853 --> 01:29:44.333]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:46.434]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:29:46.454 --> 01:29:48.254]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:29:48.594 --> 01:29:51.215]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:29:51.235 --> 01:29:52.095]  This is insane.
[01:29:52.515 --> 01:29:54.135]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:29:54.395 --> 01:29:56.936]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:29:57.396 --> 01:29:58.916]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:29:58.936 --> 01:30:00.777]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:30:00.797 --> 01:30:02.657]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:30:03.517 --> 01:30:09.439]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:30:09.699 --> 01:30:11.039]  All just moderate dose.
[01:30:12.551 --> 01:30:20.540]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.963]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:22.983 --> 01:30:24.564]  But thank you for committing.
[01:30:28.226 --> 01:30:31.049]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:30:31.409 --> 01:30:34.032]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:30:34.052 --> 01:30:38.797]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:30:39.277 --> 01:30:45.404]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:30:45.444 --> 01:30:48.547]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:30:48.887 --> 01:30:50.209]  It's called reap what you sow.

[01:32:26.116 --> 01:32:32.821]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:32:32.961 --> 01:32:34.702]  There is no comparison.

[01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:39.331]  Okay, listen.
[01:33:39.731 --> 01:33:56.117]  This is Dr. Corsi, and I'm doing a kind of a debrief on the QAnon phenomenon, the QAnon posts, which I've been decoding and posting on Scribd and then also on Twitter and here on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.938]  Now, I want this to be an update.
[01:33:59.862 --> 01:34:05.186]  This is Saturday, from Saturday the 27th yesterday and Sunday today.
[01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:08.129]  We have not had any QAnon posts today.
[01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:17.056]  But I want to introduce it by saying, first of all, that in my intelligence background, I think that the QAnon phenomenon is real.
[01:34:18.237 --> 01:34:26.123]  I judge the QAnon is really a military intelligence source that is very close to the President.
[01:34:27.304 --> 01:34:28.425]  I'm finding that because the
[01:34:29.381 --> 01:34:32.703]  The posts tend to merit consideration.
[01:34:32.923 --> 01:34:36.784]  They prove out things that QAnon says are going to happen, happen.
[01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:46.089]  Connections that QAnon says are going to be obvious once you examine them, when you do the research, those connections are there.
[01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:52.692]  And just to start, QAnon stands for Q Anonymous.
[01:34:53.749 --> 01:35:02.437]  And Q is probably the highest level of intelligence clearance, security clearance that you can get in the U.S.
[01:35:02.477 --> 01:35:02.957]  government.
[01:35:03.177 --> 01:35:14.327]  So a QAnon is someone who is operating pretty much as an intelligent source, but operating anonymously.
[01:35:14.387 --> 01:35:20.172]  That's where we get QAnon, so that the identity is not really clear.
[01:35:21.256 --> 01:35:24.199]  Um, to anybody who's trying to figure out who QAnon is.
[01:35:24.799 --> 01:35:27.201]  It's intended to code the identity.
[01:35:27.241 --> 01:35:28.182]  That's the whole point.
[01:35:29.142 --> 01:35:37.409]  Now, I want to point out some of the issues that we're dealing with right now that QAnon is saying we are in a great awakening.
[01:35:37.469 --> 01:35:50.679]  That there has been essentially a 16-year coup d'etat, treasonous conspiracy that had been planned by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[01:35:52.071 --> 01:36:20.855]  Barack Obama has served actually eight years in terms of two terms of office and Hillary Clinton eight years two terms 16 years total as a deep state conspiracy which is being orchestrated by the deep state meaning the CIA together with other forces in the government that Clinton Obama holdovers in the Department of Justice in the FBI as well as
[01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:34.258]  The mainstream media and the establishment and the mainstream media, commercial mainstream media, essentially forming a mouthpiece for the Pravda, as it were, for the government position.
[01:36:35.078 --> 01:36:49.641]  Now, as we forward this and take a look at how QAnon communicates, I'm going to try to decode a few of these posts so you can get a good idea of the way these communications come across.
[01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:50.121]  By the way,
[01:36:50.808 --> 01:37:04.351]  QAnon was saying that the Hannity losing his Twitter account on Saturday was the result of an outside attack, not from within Twitter, but most likely a CIA attack.
[01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:12.693]  And then as you recall, the attack, Hannity's account went down after he posted three times in a row this 1649.
[01:37:12.733 --> 01:37:12.813]  Well,
[01:37:17.549 --> 01:37:20.031]  QAnon said that submission was complete.
[01:37:20.371 --> 01:37:35.502]  What 1649 is, that's the year in which Charles I in Great Britain was beheaded in a treasonous plot where Charles I was the treason, guilty of treason, convicted of treason.
[01:37:36.242 --> 01:37:45.149]  And so in 1649, those posts that were coming out from Hannity suggested that we're moving into a phase
[01:37:46.005 --> 01:38:13.711]  In which it's going to be more clearly said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were involved in treason trying to cancel a duly elected president from serving on this concocted Russian collusion theme was based on false research that was known to be false out of Great Britain from this fusion GPS dossier that was used to get
[01:38:14.651 --> 01:38:22.794]  FISA court approval to conduct electronic surveillance on Donald Trump's campaign and transition, which is a treason.
[01:38:23.054 --> 01:38:25.715]  That's going to be increasingly said.
[01:38:26.315 --> 01:38:42.181]  And so when Hannity posted this 1649 and his Twitter account was attacked, the deep state does not want the message coming out that we're now about to experience a, I believe, a Trump counterattack.
[01:38:43.075 --> 01:38:53.737]  Other this Mueller effort to the first effort of the deep state, the Obama Clinton planners to remove Trump from office has failed.
[01:38:54.537 --> 01:39:00.518]  And now Trump has the forces together and assembled and is ready to go into action to battle with a counterattack.
[01:39:00.538 --> 01:39:10.260]  Uh, and then the posts that we've been getting, uh, over the last few days have suggested
[01:39:11.289 --> 01:39:30.679]  That Donald Trump with this executive order that he signed, uh, on the 12th, uh, 21st of December, which gives the treasury the right to confiscate the assets of those engaged in serious human rights violations and those who are basically engaged in corruption.
[01:39:30.699 --> 01:39:37.243]  Uh, and did by the way, declare a state of national emergency on that, uh, has positioned
[01:39:38.078 --> 01:39:55.433]  President Trump to use exceptional powers, including martial law, and to bring various of these treasonous offenders before a military tribunal, if in fact that's decided to be the best recourse to bring them to justice.
[01:39:56.494 --> 01:40:04.041]  Now, one of the posts that we got today, and here's how the QAnon posts go, they're being posted on the deep internet.
[01:40:05.187 --> 01:40:09.448]  Very much on the eight chans, which are a bulletin board.
[01:40:09.488 --> 01:40:10.808]  They're hard to navigate.
[01:40:11.529 --> 01:40:13.469]  It takes some time to navigate them.
[01:40:13.489 --> 01:40:20.451]  They're kind of rough in terms of the dialogue on them is pretty robust.
[01:40:20.511 --> 01:40:23.712]  People don't have any, everybody's anonymous.
[01:40:24.392 --> 01:40:29.513]  And so they call out people and throw you off the board if you're not following the right protocol.
[01:40:30.413 --> 01:40:38.258]  But I want to read this one and decode it for you, because this is how you've got to basically understand the Q posts.
[01:40:39.059 --> 01:40:47.464]  And he's doing this in order to open our minds and to get everybody to think, the anonymous out there working on this, to see the connections.
[01:40:48.244 --> 01:40:50.686]  So this is a post which was on Saturday.
[01:40:50.706 --> 01:40:54.008]  It occurred at really two in the morning.
[01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:58.631]  Q, I believe, went to Davos with
[01:40:59.777 --> 01:41:10.680]  President Trump, and he's coming back saying, saying this basically, do you expect HRC, GS, Hussein, etc.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:18.322]  to stand in a public courtroom with potential crooked judges and tainted liberal juries?
[01:41:19.062 --> 01:41:27.604]  Now that's, do you expect Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Hussein is always Barack Obama, Hussein, Barack Hussein Obama,
[01:41:28.599 --> 01:41:37.743]  And Q is asking, you know, we're not going to put them up to public trial because you've got liberal judges, liberal juries.
[01:41:38.523 --> 01:41:41.924]  They, you know, they make a show trial out of this and maybe get acquitted.
[01:41:42.725 --> 01:41:52.969]  So don't, you know, I've got to take seriously the fact that this executive order established the powers of martial law to go after corruption and human trafficking.
[01:41:54.209 --> 01:41:56.350]  Then Q next in this post says,
[01:41:57.637 --> 01:41:59.098]  How do you defuse a bomb?
[01:42:00.439 --> 01:42:03.401]  Knowledge of which wires, strings to cut.
[01:42:04.602 --> 01:42:14.470]  Now, Q is also saying here that just having trials against Hillary and Obama and George Soros are not enough.
[01:42:15.471 --> 01:42:23.617]  That there's a much more demanding justice that we get here, which goes after the globalists, the deep state.
[01:42:24.575 --> 01:42:24.956]  All right.
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:50.643]  But he also wants to make sure that in the process, he ends the globalist power to create a new world order.
[01:42:51.283 --> 01:42:55.064]  We'll pick it up from there, but that's the first introduction I want to give you.
[01:42:56.085 --> 01:42:59.506]  It's critical to support independent media operations.
[01:43:00.126 --> 01:43:06.149]  That aren't these internet ghettos like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, like Infowars.com, and to spread the articles and the videos.
[01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:11.291]  And it's more critical than ever, too, to wear t-shirts out in public.
[01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:21.056]  Depending on how extreme you want to get, wear an Infowars.com shirt, you're going to be loved, you're going to get dinner bought for you, you're going to meet maybe your future spouse 90% of the time.
[01:43:21.076 --> 01:43:25.118]  10% of the time you may get hot coffee thrown on you and somebody trying to physically attack you.
[01:43:26.036 --> 01:43:35.781]  Or wear something like Don't Tread On Me that is a symbol that other patriots recognize so you can wear your colors publicly and meet like-minded people.
[01:43:36.221 --> 01:43:37.542]  That's what flags are about.
[01:43:37.622 --> 01:43:39.163]  That's what symbols are about.
[01:43:39.663 --> 01:43:51.889]  Now I had an idea, because growing up I loved Book of the Month Club and Comic Book of the Month Club or Model of the Month Club where a model would come, you know, of a B-17 or a truck or whatever and I'd glue it together and paint it and everything.
[01:43:52.509 --> 01:43:55.051]  We have a shirt of the month that will be a
[01:43:56.071 --> 01:44:00.634]  Collectors Edition high-quality shirt that is only available for that month.
[01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:02.875]  But these shirts just came in a few days ago.
[01:44:03.335 --> 01:44:10.319]  It's a red version of our best-selling yellow version, Won't Tread on Me, with the American flag and Infowars.com.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:17.083]  This red version will only be available for the next 25 days or so, because we just got them in a few days ago, and then that's it.
[01:44:17.463 --> 01:44:17.844]  And you get
[01:44:18.504 --> 01:44:23.426]  Twenty-five percent off when you order it at Infowarestore.com in the shirt of the month.
[01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:26.287]  You sign up in that in the auto-ship function.

[01:44:29.067 --> 01:44:31.788]  And then you get the next shirt every month.
[01:44:32.389 --> 01:44:33.389]  You can give it as a gift.
[01:44:33.429 --> 01:44:34.469]  You can change the size.
[01:44:35.449 --> 01:44:39.631]  And you'll have a wardrobe of Patriot apparel for every occasion.

[01:47:00.071 --> 01:47:02.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.637 --> 01:47:24.858]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:25.278 --> 01:47:30.499]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:41.081 --> 01:47:51.364]  I want to return now to look at these QAnon posts, and I'm going to pick out a couple of them that I think are really quite critical to understand where QAnon is going.
[01:47:52.354 --> 01:47:56.055]  This is a post that was done January 22nd.
[01:47:56.075 --> 01:48:19.703]  And again, QAnon appears to be a military intelligence source that is working very closely with President Trump to expose the Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, coup d'etat, treasonous effort to really revise the Constitution, change the United States into a socialist or European-style communist party.
[01:48:20.792 --> 01:48:24.374]  Uh, revise the Constitution and the Second Amendment.
[01:48:24.414 --> 01:48:49.370]  I mean, it goes on, but I want to, um, focus on this one because it deals with the, uh, the memos that we've been getting out from, uh, that are now supposedly many of them lost between, uh, this, uh, Strozik, Peter Strozik and Lisa Page, uh, in the Department of Justice, the FBI, uh, internal workings.
[01:48:50.129 --> 01:48:57.933]  Now, we still have, supposedly these missing emails have been found, but they've not been released yet to Congress.
[01:48:58.853 --> 01:49:14.922]  Now, QAnon asks, what would happen if the text originating from an FBI agent to several internals, FBI agents, discussed the assassination possibility of the POTUS or member of his family?
[01:49:16.588 --> 01:49:33.357]  If my hypothesis is right, and QAnon repeatedly says, you know, we know all, we see all, I think that the reality of a coup has triggered military intelligence access to much of the NSA intelligence.
[01:49:34.198 --> 01:49:36.919]  So I don't think any of these emails have been lost.
[01:49:36.979 --> 01:49:40.701]  I don't think any of Hillary's emails have been lost.
[01:49:41.402 --> 01:49:43.443]  And what QAnon is signaling
[01:49:44.415 --> 01:49:55.041]  From an intelligence point of view, QAnon's kind of acting like a deep throat here in Watergate, but sharing the intelligence, more intelligence than ever has been shared with the American public.
[01:49:55.061 --> 01:50:07.947]  QAnon suggesting the missing emails, Strozik and Page basically got down to talking about assassinating Trump, if that was the only way to keep him from being president.
[01:50:08.848 --> 01:50:12.750]  Now, one of the texts suggested that foreign allies were involved.
[01:50:13.698 --> 01:50:17.840]  Now again, this would be explosive information.
[01:50:18.681 --> 01:50:20.162]  Forget the Russia setup.
[01:50:20.962 --> 01:50:23.283]  That's, you know, this is only the beginning.
[01:50:23.944 --> 01:50:28.706]  QAnon says, be careful what you wish for as the world turns.
[01:50:28.807 --> 01:50:36.091]  So we're getting a preview of why some of what's to come is going to be so explosive.
[01:50:37.371 --> 01:50:39.853]  Could messages such as these be publicly disclosed?
[01:50:39.873 --> 01:50:40.113]  Yes.
[01:50:41.005 --> 01:50:41.806]  I think they will be.
[01:50:41.846 --> 01:50:43.387]  And what happens to the FBI?
[01:50:43.887 --> 01:50:45.348]  What happens to the Department of Justice?
[01:50:45.388 --> 01:50:51.972]  Well, both of them will undergo serious consideration of being closed down.
[01:50:53.033 --> 01:51:09.803]  If they went that rogue that not only they were considering preventing a duly elected president who won the Electoral College vote from sitting in the White House and being president, to a conspiracy that included assassinating the president or contemplating it, that's not going to be tolerated within a
[01:51:10.473 --> 01:51:13.295]  Justice Department or FBI that's become that corrupt.
[01:51:13.815 --> 01:51:15.256]  What happens to the Special Counsel?
[01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:17.217]  What happens in general?
[01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:19.178]  The Special Counsel will probably be closed down.
[01:51:20.118 --> 01:51:27.302]  Because again, as Q says, every FBI, DOJ, previous case could be challenged, lawless.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:47.211]  It's a lawless FBI, lawless, keeping information, critical information from cases that are being prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which is a clear violation of Supreme Court regulations of demanding prosecution of share information that could be detrimental to the defense.
[01:51:48.132 --> 01:51:50.033]  Then QAnon says, think logically.
[01:51:51.275 --> 01:51:53.557]  And that first part of the post wasn't frightening enough.
[01:51:53.597 --> 01:52:04.228]  What he says is, Conan Exodus says, we have not started the drops regarding human trafficking, sacrifices, yet worse.
[01:52:05.289 --> 01:52:08.632]  Now, this is pretty frightening, especially as how he couches it.
[01:52:08.672 --> 01:52:14.138]  He says, those parentheses, good and bold, who know cannot sleep.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.946]  Those good who know cannot find peace.
[01:52:18.667 --> 01:52:23.897]  Those good who know cannot rest until the responsible are held accountable.
[01:52:26.363 --> 01:52:37.470]  This signals that what we're going to get on what has been kind of prefigured in the Pizzagate, I think the Pizzagate got out of the gate too fast.
[01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:52.620]  I think now QAnon is saying we're going to get some serious evidence that is going to make the country extremely disturbed about the behavior of these political elites who thought they were above the Constitution to engage in a
[01:52:53.653 --> 01:52:58.275]  Coup d'etat to keep Hillary Clinton in office following Barack Obama.
[01:52:59.416 --> 01:53:03.338]  QAnon says, nobody can possibly imagine the pure evil and corruption out there.
[01:53:04.358 --> 01:53:06.719]  Those you trust are most guilty of sin.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.120]  Who are we taught to trust?
[01:53:10.061 --> 01:53:22.687]  Well, if the people we're taught to trust, including the elite politicians, the people in high positions in corporations, people in the media,
[01:53:23.476 --> 01:53:30.020]  Are guilty of the atrocities of human trafficking, pedophilia, human sacrifices.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.822]  The killing rightly says if you're religious, pray.
[01:53:33.842 --> 01:53:39.024]  I said 60% of must remain private, at least for humanity.
[01:53:39.064 --> 01:53:43.447]  Now, it's been a controversial line because people are saying we want full disclosure.
[01:53:44.107 --> 01:53:45.008]  We can handle it.
[01:53:45.668 --> 01:53:52.812]  I mean, I'm going to remind you that I've had a lot of training and under security clearances working in universities where
[01:53:53.473 --> 01:53:57.877]  I work with some of the best psychologists in the world.
[01:53:59.558 --> 01:54:03.181]  Many of whom are psychopaths.
[01:54:06.224 --> 01:54:13.290]  If Q is right, I feel like human trafficking, human sacrificing, satanism is going to be so disturbing.
[01:54:15.612 --> 01:54:21.097]  I'm going to recommend that the majority of people don't disturb you, quit looking at it.
[01:54:21.798 --> 01:54:38.308]  Because what we're about to see has the potential, I believe, to create serious psychological damage in normal people who aren't prepared to comprehend or deal with the horrors that are going to be the reality that we're about to have exposed.
[01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:43.572]  And again, I think that's the final act.
[01:54:43.832 --> 01:54:45.553]  I think we're now going into the counterattack.
[01:54:46.033 --> 01:54:47.274]  We're going to have a final act.
[01:54:47.924 --> 01:54:55.489]  And the final act is going to be the exposure of the Satanism, the pedophilia, the human trafficking, the abuse of children.
[01:54:55.509 --> 01:55:06.717]  And it's going to be a mind-altering to comprehend that this really went on in America and worldwide with the global elite.
[01:55:08.758 --> 01:55:13.362]  One more thing I want to comment on just before we wrap up here is that
[01:55:15.032 --> 01:55:26.377]  A number of the Q&A posts have suggested that Julian Assange was extracted out of London in January 5th and 6th.
[01:55:28.558 --> 01:55:34.701]  And what we're getting now is kind of a backstory that what happens is you get the backstory filled in.
[01:55:35.881 --> 01:55:44.245]  The backstory gets filled in when you have an intelligence operation that is determined
[01:55:45.302 --> 01:55:48.483]  To explain what already happened.
[01:55:49.183 --> 01:56:00.306]  So we find out, after this, that Julian Assange has a diplomatic passport, a diplomatic passport... Yes?
[01:56:00.326 --> 01:56:01.907]  Hello?
[01:56:02.947 --> 01:56:04.007]  I'll catch you in a minute.
[01:56:05.868 --> 01:56:11.649]  What we find here is we find... I thought that might be something wrong with the broadcast, that's why I picked it up.
[01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:14.430]  What we find here is that Julian Assange
[01:56:15.587 --> 01:56:28.596]  I believe has already been extracted and that we're learning about the diplomatic passport and everything else is just explaining it and quite likely we're going to see Julian Assange return to the United States.
[01:56:28.636 --> 01:56:43.346]  He's not committed any crime here and he's going to be part of the final act which a lot of the information that he brings with him which he will finally release is going to also I think reveal the deep dark secrets that we are now facing with the
[01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:52.437]  Plot, which was really a plot to destroy the Constitution, to put Hillary Clinton in power for eight years, to establish the mainstream media.
[01:56:53.317 --> 01:56:57.120]  Quite frankly, I think it's amazing that Donald Trump did win.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:06.908]  The United States has been given a grace of God opportunity to repent and reform and to get back to our fundamental principles.
[01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:13.073]  I don't know of anyone in the country other than Donald Trump who is capable of doing this.
[01:57:14.014 --> 01:57:15.315]  I've known him for 40 years.
[01:57:15.355 --> 01:57:18.876]  I've got enormous trust and confidence in his abilities.
[01:57:18.896 --> 01:57:22.157]  I urge everyone out there to continue following.
[01:57:22.797 --> 01:57:25.018]  We're doing InfoWars to pray for Donald Trump.
[01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:26.058]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:26.718 --> 01:57:28.159]  Jerome Corsi for InfoWars.
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:54.063]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:57:54.943 --> 01:57:58.985]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.846]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:58:02.647 --> 01:58:05.748]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:58:07.273 --> 01:58:19.398]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:58:20.098 --> 01:58:35.145]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:42.132]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:58:42.152 --> 01:58:44.554]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[01:58:44.634 --> 01:58:48.338]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:58:48.418 --> 01:58:48.739]  Go ahead.
[01:58:49.384 --> 01:58:51.225]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:58:51.245 --> 01:58:54.286]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:56.247]  It just gets old, man.
[01:58:56.547 --> 01:58:58.268]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:58:58.969 --> 01:59:01.070]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:59:01.290 --> 01:59:05.272]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:59:05.292 --> 01:59:07.733]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:59:08.593 --> 01:59:10.915]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:59:11.275 --> 01:59:12.356]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:59:12.636 --> 01:59:13.537]  Us being shut down?
[01:59:13.757 --> 01:59:14.818]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:59:15.238 --> 01:59:16.279]  You know what, Alex?
[01:59:16.299 --> 01:59:17.400]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:18.240]  Hey, Frank!
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:23.864]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:59:24.184 --> 01:59:28.468]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:59:28.708 --> 01:59:31.570]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:32.210]  You understand?
[01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:33.571]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:59:33.952 --> 01:59:35.052]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:59:36.053 --> 01:59:41.418]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:59:41.678 --> 01:59:42.379]  Do you understand?
[01:59:42.399 --> 01:59:43.620]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:59:44.021 --> 01:59:45.542]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:59:48.685 --> 01:59:52.789]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:53.309 --> 01:59:54.611]  It's Alex Jones.
