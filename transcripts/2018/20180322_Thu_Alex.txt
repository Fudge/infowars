[00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:20.820]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.382]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:39.501]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 22nd day of March 2018.
[00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.023]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.025]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:45.947]  It's here!
[00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:50.171]  The globalists were intending to shut down free speech basically worldwide in 2018.
[00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:58.021]  Hillary was meant to drive that operation here in the United States, sealing the planet's fate because if the U.S.
[00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:59.481]  falls, they all fall.
[00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:02.863]  And despite the fact that Trump has been in office,
[00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:12.375]  The last 14 months they're still trying to go ahead with their plans while they try to sabotage and unseat the populist Americana president.
[00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:24.466]  CBS is set to air the Stormy Daniels Trump sex breakdown with Anderson Cooper smiling like a demonic jack-o'-lantern.
[00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:31.748]  But never anything about Hillary or Bill and the rapes and the abuse and all the rest of it.
[00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:37.913]  So we're going to be looking at that trailer and first look at that and more coming up today.
[00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:50.362]  We have the media criticizing Trump for saying he would beat the hell out of Joe Biden, implying that Trump just said this out of the clear blue when Joe Biden two years ago and again a few days ago said he would beat up Donald Trump.
[00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:53.445]  Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.
[00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.647]  Actually, he is weak both mentally and physically.
[00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:59.150]  And yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault.
[00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.933]  He doesn't know me, but he should go down fast and hard crying all the way.
[00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:05.335]  Don't threaten people, Joe.
[00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:15.283]  And Dew has put together, one of our crew, a new boil down of creepy Joe Biden groping children and women.
[00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:18.886]  So that's going to be coming up here in just a little while.
[00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.179]  So we have that information.
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.022]  Of course, we have the big news that Trump has now had one of his lawyers resign.
[00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:35.444]  Roger Stone told us about this on air six months ago that these lawyers were telling Trump, oh, you're not even being looked at.
[00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:36.545]  We know you've done nothing wrong.
[00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:38.265]  Just let Mueller keep going on.
[00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:39.626]  Let him expand into everything.
[00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.447]  You know, let him grab stuff without warrants.
[00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:47.657]  And then it'll be over by November, it'll be over by December, it'll be over by January.
[00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:52.119]  Now Mueller told him it's never over and it's everything, nothing to do with Russia.
[00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.300]  And it's behind statute of limitations too.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.821]  They're gonna go back 30 years, 40 years.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.682]  They're going to probably mount cameras in Trump's toilets.
[00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:03.945]  I mean, that's the level of harassment.
[00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:08.930]  All of his renters, all of his condo owners, all the golf course members, they're all being harassed.
[00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.619]  They're all getting visits by the rogue Justice Department, still run by Clinton Crime Network operatives at the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth tier.
[00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:21.358]  It's amazing this is going on.
[00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:34.569]  This country is in the middle of a civil war with globalist forces, allied with leftist forces, Hollywood and others, who believe America's done, who believe they can break our will, and who believe they can suck us dry.
[00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:37.468]  But the challenge is really all up to you.
[00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.531]  Dr. Corsi is going to be on for two hours on C-SPAN coming up in about an hour and a half.
[00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:47.893]  We're going to be carrying some of that live because he's going to be on with Cheryl Atkinson who hosts a show on there.
[00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:55.978]  Remember the former CBS investigative journalist who exposed that Obama shipped guns into Mexico to get people killed to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:59.100]  And then trans-shipped them to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:03.504]  But that is coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:06.006]  He'll be on two different programs today.
[00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:09.209]  One with Sheryl Atkinson and on another back-to-back.
[00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:22.762]  So that's important because he's going to have some hard-hitting information and it's getting through that electronic Berlin Wall where they say anything that exposes corruption is a conspiracy theory and so it must be banned because there's no First Amendment.
[00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:25.326]  They're saying Deep State doesn't exist.
[00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:28.408]  They're saying that covert action doesn't exist.
[00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.452]  Senator Rand Paul went on television and radio this week and said, no it does exist.
[00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:33.073]  Of course it does.
[00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:34.574]  They play these games.
[00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.636]  So it's all coming up.
[00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:39.458]  A gigantic transmission today.
[00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.084]  One that no one is going to want to miss.
[00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:50.977]  And of course, the big enchilada, YouTube bans guns for everybody but Hollywood and the video game makers.
[00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.341]  And we've got the law, we can stop them.
[00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:53.762]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.173 --> 00:05:01.237]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:16.566]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:18.409]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:38.408]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:42.131]  All of us have got front row seats, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:54.899]  All of us have front row seats to the 21st century technological cultural
[00:06:56.647 --> 00:06:58.569]  Population collision.
[00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:07.076]  The establishment is digging into armored bunkers, mainly in New Zealand, where Obama is getting his bunker ready.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.143]  They're waiting for some singularity to come save them.
[00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.686]  They're waiting for the AI gods to come save them.
[00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.869]  They've already decided that humanity must be written off.
[00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:23.303]  Well, they wrote themselves off.
[00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:24.583]  They wrote their families off.
[00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:30.024]  They wrote their souls off when they decided to join evil a long time ago.
[00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:33.105]  So, of course, they have that perspective that everything's going to go down.
[00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:36.726]  And when people like them are in charge, things do go down.
[00:07:37.846 --> 00:07:38.186]  Hill.
[00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:50.728]  But now we've got a president and other populist leaders around the world, from Brazil, to Catalan Spain, to Italy, to Iceland,
[00:07:52.022 --> 00:07:53.823]  To many areas in Africa and Asia.
[00:07:55.964 --> 00:07:56.484]  The Brexit.
[00:07:58.265 --> 00:07:59.886]  Eastern Europe's on fire awakening.
[00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.407]  Russia's awakening.
[00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:05.329]  Leading the charge against globalism.
[00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:06.329]  That's why they're enemy number one.
[00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:10.912]  And if Trump can secure the republic, he'll be enemy number one.
[00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:12.733]  From the globalists.
[00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:18.456]  And there are the communist Chinese captaining, commanding, funding,
[00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:25.886]  Ruthlessly engineering and backing the big tax-free foundations that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:30.369]  And those are the players!
[00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:38.534]  The globalist-controlled Vatican, the Communist Chinese, the unelected EU, Hollywood, the radical-funded jihadis.
[00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:47.920]  All lined up against the West and free market and prosperity and the Renaissance ethos.
[00:08:52.278 --> 00:08:52.838]  Think about that.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.923]  And Trump goes into Saudi Arabia, tells them, I'm going to take you out if you don't reverse everything you're doing.
[00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:03.523]  They go, absolutely.
[00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.904]  The globalists set us up.
[00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:06.804]  British intelligence, as you know, they've been telling us to do this.
[00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:07.805]  We don't like this.
[00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:10.286]  We know the radical jihadis are used to threaten us as well.
[00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.707]  If you want to treat us like equal partners, we're ready to stop it all right now.
[00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:19.630]  And boom, the funding gets cut off to the globalists here in the U.S., you name it, because they were using it as clandestine funding.
[00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:29.825]  And Trump's trying to bring in optimism right now.
[00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:53.240]  Trump's trying to get our morale up so that our will's not broken and magically everything starts turning around as soon as we have that optimism, as soon as we believe in ourselves again, and as soon as all these different unfair globalist trade deals that are one-sided are exposed.
[00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:02.632]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:10:06.596 --> 00:10:07.357]  This just in.
[00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:12.161]  House Intel votes to formally end the Russia probe.
[00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:19.549]  Of course, they announced that they found no evidence of that a week ago.
[00:10:19.569 --> 00:10:24.273]  And it got zero attention.
[00:10:25.574 --> 00:10:25.915]  Zero.
[00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:54.268]  But Robert Mueller and this whole rogue group of Clinton operatives, to a man, to a woman, CNN, MSNBC, all these fake news purveyors, the bully media that tries to bully the American people, tries to break our will, they tell us that Mueller's got Trump cornered, and Mueller's got Trump in his fate, and that Trump's fate belongs to Mueller.
[00:10:56.015 --> 00:11:01.556]  They're saying America's fate and how you voted can be checkmated by Mueller.
[00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.116]  But that's why we have a separation of powers.
[00:11:03.136 --> 00:11:05.097]  That's why we have co-equal three branches of government.
[00:11:05.377 --> 00:11:12.798]  So one branch can't circumvent and destroy the other and destroy the balance, the separation of powers.
[00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:17.919]  But Mueller is actually from the executive where Trump has even more power.
[00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:25.140]  But it's all this con game, all this Svengali gaslighting fraud.
[00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:29.940]  That Mueller is the 45th President of the United States.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.161]  Emperor Robert Mueller.
[00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:39.542]  Amazing.
[00:11:43.543 --> 00:11:53.645]  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted Thursday to release the Republican version of the committee's report on its Russia investigation, which found no evidence of collusion
[00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.356]  Coordination or conspiracy between the Trump administration and the Russians.
[00:11:57.396 --> 00:12:01.497]  The report will be released to the public pending a classification review by the intelligence community.
[00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:09.899]  But that doesn't matter, because Mueller says he's never going to shut anything down.
[00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:23.562]  And Rosenstein, when he set Mueller up outside of Trump, changed the order in the Justice Department, they tricked Trump into signing it, to transfer the power to a bunch of Democrats.
[00:12:24.884 --> 00:12:25.685]  In the chain of command.
[00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:41.820]  And then if that evaporates, if those folks don't sign off on it and get fired, it moves all the way down to two neocon Republicans in Texas put in by W, who hate Trump.
[00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:55.373]  And then Mueller's involved in Uranium One on tarmacs with uranium, and then Hillary gets hundreds of millions of dollars, and one Podesta gets thirty million dollars.
[00:12:56.434 --> 00:12:59.917]  We're talking tarmacs, we're talking James Bond, we're talking collusion.
[00:13:00.917 --> 00:13:01.418]  They don't care.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.986]  Just like Bill and Hillary under investigation by the Justice Department, the letter Lynch meets on the tarmac to tell them the investigation has been secretly shut down.
[00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:12.828]  He'll be given a letter saying that
[00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:22.773]  The investigation's been shut down, but for public consumption, we're going to interview you, and we're going to send over McCabe and Strzok to do it.
[00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:27.457]  And they had a staged interview, and gave her the letter, and it all came out.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.722]  Madam Secretary, it's all staged.
[00:13:33.943 --> 00:13:39.628]  You can assure your Madam Secretary, Mr. President, Mr. Clinton, that nothing will be done.
[00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:51.120]  Well, you can be assured that you're going to be getting that Attorney General job as you go on, not just the interim, and you're going to be assured maybe a Supreme Court seat if you like it.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.161]  How's that sound, my little baby?
[00:13:57.064 --> 00:14:06.992]  Now, we're going to be getting more into all that as we go along, but the big news today, and I've got two of the organizations banned by YouTube coming on with us,
[00:14:08.303 --> 00:14:10.786]  In the second hour today, here's Bloomberg.
[00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:16.071]  YouTube bans firearms demo videos entering the gun control debate.
[00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:18.233]  You mean entering the First Amendment debate.
[00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:22.538]  Because they're gonna let Hollywood run their trailers with all the shoot-em-ups.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.863]  They're gonna put out all of their video games shoot-em-up.
[00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:41.513]  Channels where even major sports organizations are signing top video game players on to be sponsors and to be funded because billions of people a week watch folks play violent video games on YouTube alone.
[00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:45.755]  Think about that.
[00:14:49.516 --> 00:14:50.416]  Sites like Twitch.
[00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:55.158]  So you think about that massive, incredible,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:10.263]  Affront to the First Amendment that Twitch is now coming to ESPN, people playing video games, people playing Doom and all these other games, which is fine.
[00:15:10.303 --> 00:15:11.083]  That's your First Amendment.
[00:15:11.663 --> 00:15:12.363]  Shooting people up.
[00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:22.466]  And you can have all the Death Wish remakes come out and have those be YouTube trailers with YouTube getting tons of money.
[00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:26.147]  But if the Military Arms Channel doesn't even sell guns,
[00:15:28.424 --> 00:15:31.206]  But they just show people and review them, they're banned.
[00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:33.588]  And then, Spikes Tactical is banned.
[00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:35.249]  Because they're showing firearms.
[00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:38.691]  All selective attacks on the First Amendment.
[00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:40.092]  All discriminatory.
[00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:49.038]  And all part of a massive salvo launch to silence defense of the Second Amendment, to kill gun culture, to then kill the Second Amendment.
[00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:50.839]  This is the main assault.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.042]  And everybody better wake up and realize, this is the war.
[00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:15.598]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:15.698 --> 00:16:21.601]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:22.641]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:25.923]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:27.544]  And so much more.
[00:16:28.104 --> 00:16:29.244]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:29.464 --> 00:16:31.185]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:31.205 --> 00:16:36.888]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:37.008 --> 00:16:38.189]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:38.209 --> 00:16:40.150]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.611]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.071]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.072]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:47.233]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:48.654]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:49.954]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:00.578 --> 00:17:08.486]  On screen you see a Fox News camera inside the World Economic Forum as President Trump meets with world business leaders.
[00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:22.459]  And we've got the HD footage if you're a TV viewer that Dan Lyman shot earlier today as President Trump with three Marine One helicopters, Blackhawks, arrived there in Davos to put in another 18-hour workday.
[00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:23.921]  Works about 15 hours a day.
[00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:26.662]  When he's regularly back in the U.S.
[00:17:26.682 --> 00:17:27.923]  18 hours a day, according to sources.
[00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:33.306]  Dan Lyman, Infowars.com reporter, is on the ground in Davos.
[00:17:33.326 --> 00:17:37.428]  We haven't talked to him for 24 hours, so a lot has transcribed.
[00:17:37.448 --> 00:17:44.551]  You can follow his amazing tweets and information, not just retweeted at RealAlexJones, but also on his Twitter account.
[00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:46.472]  All right, Dan Lyman, wow, a lot's happened.
[00:17:46.753 --> 00:17:49.474]  We'll be rolling this HD footage in the background while you give us a briefing.
[00:17:49.714 --> 00:17:53.076]  Where do you want to start on day one of Davos as President Trump arrives?
[00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:55.758]  It was definitely an interesting day with Trump's arrival.
[00:17:55.939 --> 00:18:06.870]  The helipad was a lot more crowded than it has been on the other days, which is kind of a slap in the face to the other leaders that have been showing up in the past days that people, I guess, weren't as interested in.
[00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.033]  It was very crowded out there, but it was great to see him come in.
[00:18:10.093 --> 00:18:10.954]  It was magnificent.
[00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:16.537]  I would say that even the people who don't like him are still fascinated by the prospect that he's in town.
[00:18:16.577 --> 00:18:18.698]  There's a kind of an aura that he brings with him.
[00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:23.221]  There is definitely an awakening and it's happening even at the highest levels, even within Davos.
[00:18:23.241 --> 00:18:26.442]  You have the defectors here and there.
[00:18:26.883 --> 00:18:30.524]  And this video that you're airing right now, I watched that earlier today.
[00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:33.626]  The awe that Trump puts everyone in, he silenced the room.
[00:18:33.706 --> 00:18:36.848]  Someone called it that he had turned Davos into Versailles.
[00:18:37.228 --> 00:18:40.649]  And it was an incredible reception that he received there.
[00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:44.390]  And I think they all know they're in the presence of a lion, a true alpha male.
[00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.811]  The caption had something to the effect of, this is true power.
[00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:51.353]  Trump silences a room full of media journalists and globalists.
[00:18:51.773 --> 00:18:53.053]  And it's true.
[00:18:53.113 --> 00:18:54.934]  I mean, these people, they don't shut up.
[00:18:55.014 --> 00:18:56.454]  I hear them talking constantly.
[00:18:56.474 --> 00:18:57.555]  They're always on the phone.
[00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:58.475]  They're talking to each other.
[00:18:58.855 --> 00:19:03.318]  And then when you see Trump coming in the room, it's just like every cell phone is out, everyone's in awe.
[00:19:03.658 --> 00:19:14.305]  Trump brings that Trump aura, which translates so great to just the American aura, the power, confidence through strength, and peace as well.
[00:19:14.405 --> 00:19:18.807]  And he just brought that into the room, and you could see that in that video and his entrance in general.
[00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:27.533]  The man they said that couldn't beat the establishment, he couldn't beat the globalists, they were all against him, and now they worship the ground that he walks on, whether they want to admit it or not.
[00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:28.913]  That happened yesterday.
[00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:31.575]  Suddenly, the heads of tables said, we love Trump.
[00:19:31.855 --> 00:19:32.595]  I had the headline here.
[00:19:32.615 --> 00:19:33.755]  It was like, we love him.
[00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:34.796]  It's been a great year.
[00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:36.337]  Actually, the world economy's better.
[00:19:36.397 --> 00:19:37.177]  Thank God for Trump.
[00:19:37.517 --> 00:19:39.498]  And it's like suddenly they've all been attacking him.
[00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:41.339]  And then now they all start saying, we love Trump.
[00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:41.899]  We love Trump.
[00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:47.041]  I mean, this just shows how Rockefellers and people are able to bully all these guys into line.
[00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:48.422]  Trump's not even bullying it.
[00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:49.342]  He's just leading.
[00:19:59.148 --> 00:20:03.311]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:22.106]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:22.426 --> 00:20:26.630]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.884 --> 00:20:51.508]  Coming up in the next segment, they're bleeping the cuss words out right now, I have several compilation videos of Hollywood dirtbags saying they're anti-gun, get rid of the Second Amendment, but then misusing firearms in movies.
[00:20:52.828 --> 00:20:56.229]  And I'm gonna do a whole presentation on this, and I'm gonna lay it all out.
[00:20:57.869 --> 00:21:01.790]  But understand this, Twitch has billions of views,
[00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:06.154]  A week on YouTube, Facebook and other platforms.
[00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:07.674]  It's moving to ESPN.
[00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:11.655]  Amazon is pushing it as its new big rollout.
[00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.395]  Watching people play video games.
[00:21:14.275 --> 00:21:17.516]  Amazon aims to become ESPN of video games with Twitch deal.
[00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:18.916]  Now I'm not saying ban video games.
[00:21:21.257 --> 00:21:23.157]  But they've been connected to mass shooters.
[00:21:23.177 --> 00:21:25.018]  They've been connected to desensitization.
[00:21:25.878 --> 00:21:31.739]  Shoot-em-up games were created in the 60s during Vietnam because a lot of the soldiers wouldn't shoot somebody up close.
[00:21:32.827 --> 00:21:45.077]  So they would have simulated targets and things that popped up, and then they moved to projections in rooms where you'd go through buildings shooting, and that is where video games began.
[00:21:45.217 --> 00:21:51.302]  Doom, that's one of the most popular shoot-'em-up, was developed in, what, the 70s and then 80s for the military.
[00:21:52.183 --> 00:21:52.943]  So that's a fact.
[00:21:53.704 --> 00:21:55.605]  And so these are killing training aids.
[00:21:56.126 --> 00:21:57.567]  Instinctive shooting training aids.
[00:21:58.749 --> 00:22:02.691]  Because if you do not have a strong killer instinct, you will be dead marine!
[00:22:02.971 --> 00:22:03.491]  All of that.
[00:22:07.453 --> 00:22:09.754]  So now, think about this.
[00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:18.038]  You've got all the violent Hollywood movies and Google and YouTube making billions off the advertisements in the aggregate in the last decade.
[00:22:18.058 --> 00:22:26.862]  I mean, I've seen the numbers sometimes where YouTube makes 300, 400, 500 million a year just off movie trailers and most of them are violent.
[00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:29.689]  Stabbing, shooting, you name it.
[00:22:30.589 --> 00:22:48.439]  And all we're saying is, okay, you can have video game ads, you can have video game playing, you can have video game watching, you can have violent movies, you can have all that, but then, the Military Arms Channel, that doesn't even sell guns, reviews old guns, new guns, black powder, machine guns, you name it.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.180]  It's popular.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.681]  That guy got banned two weeks ago.
[00:22:52.422 --> 00:22:53.222]  Three weeks ago now.
[00:22:53.422 --> 00:22:55.643]  Then, Spikes Tactical, one of the most popular
[00:22:57.208 --> 00:23:00.390]  Smaller sized companies that build some of the best AR-15s reportedly.
[00:23:01.251 --> 00:23:04.473]  They got banned yesterday and Bloomberg announced it.
[00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:07.915]  And it said no more demos of firearms.
[00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:10.257]  If you show guns being shot...
[00:23:11.707 --> 00:23:15.911]  And we think you've got a sponsor, or we think somehow you're promoting guns, you're banned!
[00:23:16.512 --> 00:23:20.636]  Now they can selectively enforce that however they want, and it's total discrimination.
[00:23:20.996 --> 00:23:30.166]  If a gay couple gets a half million dollars that somebody didn't make their take because of their cultural, sexual, political persuasion,
[00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.970]  Then buy that yardstick!
[00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:53.255]  A giant mega corporation says, we will selectively not let anybody show firearms or firearms culture, but we will show you Olympic shooting, we will show you video game simulated death, virtual reality, we will show you Hollywood stuff, we will show you military footage, and it's an example.
[00:23:55.017 --> 00:24:01.639]  ABC News, CNN, all of them showed the WikiLeaks of the minivan in Iraq getting blown up by the Apache helicopter.
[00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:05.240]  We showed it days later, they banned our channel for a while.
[00:24:05.761 --> 00:24:07.061]  We threatened to sue them, they backed off.
[00:24:07.441 --> 00:24:13.663]  How is we as a news agency can't show the helicopter footage, but you can?
[00:24:14.323 --> 00:24:17.644]  Although we showed all of it, where then the troops on the ground came and saved the kids.
[00:24:18.905 --> 00:24:22.166]  That's what they didn't want, because at that time they were being anti-military.
[00:24:23.547 --> 00:24:25.509]  We weren't even being for the attack on the van.
[00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:28.992]  We were just showing the full 10-minute tape, not 30 seconds.
[00:24:31.755 --> 00:24:33.476]  And I didn't know why they did this stuff.
[00:24:33.496 --> 00:24:35.258]  See, I've been doing this so long now, I figured it out.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.383]  So, they just go, oh, we change our policies all the time.
[00:24:40.503 --> 00:24:40.863]  Oh, really?
[00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:47.530]  Like China says, if you're not a good globalist, a good communist, you can't even ride a train, have a job, get on a plane, or live.
[00:24:48.544 --> 00:24:51.965]  That's these whole social scores online, these control systems coming here.
[00:24:51.985 --> 00:25:01.307]  So now, days ahead of the big march against guns, YouTube bans firearms demo videos entering the gun control debate.
[00:25:04.427 --> 00:25:06.528]  So Trump doesn't have control of the government.
[00:25:08.008 --> 00:25:13.309]  And to punish Zuckerberg for not totally banning all libertarians, all conservatives, and all Trump,
[00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:40.408]  Information their stocks being plunged right now using this whole thing out of England To get them in line and suddenly they have banned The Facebook is just totally ratcheting down everything Christian everything pro-military everything pro-us everything pro-gun They have dialed us back from you know 70% to 99% they're not letting anybody share anything average citizens are being blocked because
[00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:58.010]  They're taking this whole Analytica thing, acting like they sold out the Republicans, when really they were owned by the Democrats and the Globalists, but they're using that to make Zuckerberg completely dial it back, which they know will plunge the company, and people know that, it'll make people leave it, and so that's another reason it's going down.
[00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:05.775]  It's exposing what Facebook's done on a much wider scale than what Bannon and others did, just public data mining it.
[00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:08.953]  So it lets the cat out of the bag there, that's bringing him down.
[00:26:09.853 --> 00:26:15.635]  And then it also is bringing him down because it will ruin Facebook and turn it into MySpace.
[00:26:16.796 --> 00:26:17.636]  So it's all happening.
[00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:21.678]  You know, Rupert Murdoch bought it, censored it, tried to control it, killed it.
[00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:24.279]  MySpace.
[00:26:25.099 --> 00:26:28.120]  So that's what's going on here, and it's gonna happen to every other one of these tech giants.
[00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:33.422]  So YouTube's running in and saying, okay, we will censor everything, just don't do this to us.
[00:26:33.482 --> 00:26:34.623]  That's what Google's saying right now.
[00:26:35.768 --> 00:26:37.249]  And so this is the end of free speech.
[00:26:37.849 --> 00:26:39.430]  Web-wide, it's on.
[00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:48.576]  Lawsuits must be filed by Spikes Tactical and by all these other groups and by us because, and that's why they backed off on banning us three weeks ago, because they know we got the lawyers.
[00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:50.357]  They knew we had them caught red-handed.
[00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:52.638]  They knew that we'd been taken down for false claims.
[00:26:53.018 --> 00:26:56.881]  They're just going to expand it now where we're shooting videos and stuff we've got.
[00:26:57.361 --> 00:26:59.923]  They're just going to have us banned and say, oh, terms of service.
[00:27:00.143 --> 00:27:01.824]  But see, that's still selective enforcement.
[00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.696]  And that's fraud!
[00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:05.187]  And it's discriminatory!
[00:27:06.112 --> 00:27:11.933]  So start making a big deal out of the violent video games, directly linked to violence, and all the movie trailers.
[00:27:12.393 --> 00:27:16.214]  And of course, they're going to have people say, Jones wants movie trailers and stuff banned.
[00:27:16.614 --> 00:27:16.834]  No!
[00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:18.654]  You're banning us from our speech.
[00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:25.455]  We're saying, buy this yardstick, the video games, Twitch, the movie trailers, all of it must be banned.
[00:27:25.795 --> 00:27:28.136]  We're not showing people improperly using firearms.
[00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:30.496]  We're not showing massive shootouts in nightclubs.
[00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:31.816]  We're not doing all this.
[00:27:32.077 --> 00:27:34.617]  We're showing how to properly use firearms and you're banning us.
[00:27:38.422 --> 00:27:40.963]  So the headline is, Will YouTube Ban Twitch?
[00:27:43.303 --> 00:27:43.623]  Next!
[00:27:45.184 --> 00:27:45.924]  Now, I'm going to break.

[00:28:34.911 --> 00:28:35.992]  That is selling out.
[00:28:36.012 --> 00:28:36.112]  33% off.
[00:28:36.132 --> 00:28:36.252]  Only $9.95.
[00:28:36.332 --> 00:28:36.992]  $3 a product in that.
[00:28:37.172 --> 00:28:37.613]  That is amazing.
[00:28:40.994 --> 00:28:42.095]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:28:42.155 --> 00:28:42.835]  Get aggressive.
[00:28:43.295 --> 00:28:43.855]  Double down.
[00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:45.256]  They're coming up with the First Amendment.
[00:28:45.316 --> 00:28:46.217]  They're coming after everybody.
[00:28:46.277 --> 00:28:46.777]  This is it.
[00:28:47.037 --> 00:28:48.858]  The fight just began when Trump got in.
[00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:52.980]  If you want to let the globalists win, then don't get upset and don't support Infowars.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.900]  But I know you are.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.541]  We salute you.
[00:28:55.641 --> 00:29:09.868]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:18.486]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:29:19.906 --> 00:29:22.427]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:26.629]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:29.770]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:36.612]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:29:38.584 --> 00:29:45.189]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.150]  It's up to us personally.
[00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:55.397]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:57.198]  I expected that to happen.
[00:29:58.379 --> 00:29:59.720]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:12.634]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:14.875]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:27.199]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:30:27.779 --> 00:30:29.960]  And we've already come so far together
[00:30:31.004 --> 00:30:40.006]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:45.988]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:54.990]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:30:57.236 --> 00:31:05.505]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:07.487]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:31:08.488 --> 00:31:11.131]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:13.774]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[00:31:13.794 --> 00:31:18.699]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:30.550]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.574]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:31:35.982 --> 00:31:36.642]  Our game changing.
[00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:57.271]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids, it just does incredible things.
[00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:59.152]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[00:31:59.172 --> 00:32:02.135]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:32:02.175 --> 00:32:10.062]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine and other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:32:10.682 --> 00:32:13.365]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[00:32:14.085 --> 00:32:21.811]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:29.156]  Silver, salt, nano silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[00:32:29.196 --> 00:32:30.497]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[00:32:30.697 --> 00:32:31.878]  You can swallow it as well.
[00:32:32.258 --> 00:32:38.503]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:38.863 --> 00:32:40.244]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:32:40.264 --> 00:32:49.873]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:32:50.194 --> 00:32:53.256]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:01.204]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.373 --> 00:33:07.394]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[00:33:07.414 --> 00:33:08.455]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:33:08.575 --> 00:33:09.276]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.396 --> 00:33:10.057]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.177 --> 00:33:10.757]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.797 --> 00:33:13.800]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:23.429]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.230]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.054]  News coverage has confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:33:30.407 --> 00:33:35.211]  Watch as Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:37.934]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:33:37.954 --> 00:33:40.436]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:33:40.456 --> 00:33:41.397]  It just pancaked.
[00:33:41.917 --> 00:33:46.541]  He took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[00:33:47.542 --> 00:33:49.704]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:33:49.804 --> 00:33:56.868]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:33:56.888 --> 00:33:57.108]  U.S.A.
[00:33:57.209 --> 00:33:59.030]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.671]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:03.933]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:34:04.073 --> 00:34:05.654]  Some former U.S.
[00:34:05.714 --> 00:34:07.936]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:11.698]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:34:11.838 --> 00:34:17.340]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.921]  Russian, stop!
[00:34:18.961 --> 00:34:19.761]  Denied everything.
[00:34:19.781 --> 00:34:21.121]  He called it all fake news.
[00:34:21.281 --> 00:34:23.302]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:34:23.442 --> 00:34:26.163]  This is a national emergency.
[00:34:26.183 --> 00:34:31.885]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:33.746]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[00:34:36.487 --> 00:34:39.370]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:39.870]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:07.882]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:07.962 --> 00:35:11.385]  We are living in quite a time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:11.405 --> 00:35:12.445]  Quite a time.
[00:35:37.327 --> 00:35:49.670]  I was just thinking during the break how blessed we are that Trump got in and not Hillary Clinton.
[00:35:51.171 --> 00:35:58.673]  And I get really frustrated thinking that a lot of the audience may not know you are the core resistance to this and how important you are.
[00:35:58.693 --> 00:36:05.895]  And the fact that when you get excited and you spread the word and you take action, the globalists quake in abject fear.
[00:36:10.742 --> 00:36:12.384]  But when you fall asleep, they win.
[00:36:17.228 --> 00:36:18.530]  We have a huge announcement here.
[00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.675]  I'm just going to get into all the Hollywood people that are anti-gun and improperly using firearms in movies.
[00:36:23.735 --> 00:36:30.482]  And the fact that, by extension, YouTube banning average citizens displaying firearms, using firearms,
[00:36:32.073 --> 00:36:45.602]  They've opened themselves up to total discrimination lawsuits because they let Twitch and Amazon and all these other platforms show guns being used improperly, simulated murders, real murders, you name it.
[00:36:45.823 --> 00:36:54.549]  Billions of people watching a week and then they want to ban thousands of pro-gun channels.
[00:36:55.289 --> 00:36:56.190]  That's what's being banned.
[00:36:57.491 --> 00:37:00.593]  And it's a monopoly action by Hollywood and the dirtbags.
[00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:03.231]  And it's against the gun culture.
[00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:08.032]  You can put up some of those articles we were showing during the break that I wanted.
[00:37:08.052 --> 00:37:09.273]  I wanted to print those.
[00:37:09.313 --> 00:37:10.393]  Maybe they're in the printer.
[00:37:12.414 --> 00:37:30.318]  Out of Bloomberg, out of Associated Press, about Twitch getting signed with ESPN, you name it, Amazon, where it's going to be the new sports stars, like Ready Player One, are going to be virtual reality players with billions of people
[00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:36.093]  Watching world championships of different types of video games.
[00:37:36.893 --> 00:37:39.195]  That is just mind-blowing.
[00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:42.838]  And like I said, will you guys print me those little articles?
[00:37:42.858 --> 00:37:43.899]  Thank you, I'd appreciate that.
[00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:44.899]  That'd be great.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.702]  Now, I got one of them right here.
[00:37:48.722 --> 00:37:49.463]  That's one of those others.
[00:37:51.104 --> 00:37:59.791]  Continuing looking at this, if you look at what's been going on in our country, and if you look at what's been unfolding,
[00:38:01.314 --> 00:38:08.999]  Globalism is all about selling the nation out and about making people poor so you can control them.
[00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:17.323]  And it's about getting rid of real free markets because that creates diversity of wealth and diversity of action and diversity of political systems.
[00:38:17.724 --> 00:38:21.846]  And that's not good for big corporatists that want vertical integration and to run everything.
[00:38:23.507 --> 00:38:29.751]  So, if I go into it, it would take four or five hours
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:41.845]  To break it all down, but they just hope you're ignorant when you hear about free market all day long.
[00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:50.091]  And when you hear about how Trump's trying to kill the free market.
[00:38:52.653 --> 00:39:00.059]  When China has a 15% corporate tax and we had a 40, that prohibits us from having corporations based here.
[00:39:02.742 --> 00:39:06.705]  When we went to 15 this year, China went to zero.
[00:39:09.468 --> 00:39:12.850]  Trump announced a 15% tariff on their steel.
[00:39:13.471 --> 00:39:15.793]  To balance that, that was only one item.
[00:39:16.974 --> 00:39:19.816]  Not them across the board putting a 15% on us.
[00:39:23.539 --> 00:39:25.241]  They announced a bunch of tariffs.
[00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:28.884]  Well, Trump just took action.
[00:39:31.127 --> 00:39:36.493]  Trump to slap China with a $50 billion in tariffs over intellectual property theft.
[00:39:36.894 --> 00:39:43.281]  China doesn't even deny the fact that they just ignore everyone's trademark, everyone's copyright.
[00:39:43.821 --> 00:39:51.270]  And this isn't like where the Pepe the Frog creator says use it and people use it and years later he trademarks it and comes back and says you can't even have it on an image.
[00:39:52.748 --> 00:40:13.648]  This is where they go and copy the computer chips, they go and copy the boat designs, they go and copy our machines, they copy everything that's patented, they copy Rolexes, they copy Timexes, they copy everything as everyone knows, and half the time you open it up and it doesn't even work!
[00:40:17.062 --> 00:40:20.424]  That's why you go to a store and every party favor is made in China.
[00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.304]  And every toy car is made in China.
[00:40:22.465 --> 00:40:24.165]  And every water hose is made in China.
[00:40:24.886 --> 00:40:26.727]  And every water hose tip is made in China.
[00:40:26.947 --> 00:40:28.427]  And every shovel is made in China.
[00:40:29.228 --> 00:40:33.009]  Because nobody can compete with zero taxes.
[00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.972]  Nobody can compete with no regulatory controls as they pile them on us.
[00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:40.253]  Nobody can compete with slave labor.
[00:40:40.513 --> 00:40:41.333]  Not Mexico.
[00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:42.654]  Not Honduras.
[00:40:42.994 --> 00:40:43.675]  Not India.
[00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:44.435]  Nobody!
[00:40:45.964 --> 00:40:48.765]  Because they live like kings in Mexico compared to China.
[00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:52.346]  Mexico on the end of poor countries is up towards the top.
[00:40:52.386 --> 00:40:52.806]  Look it up.
[00:40:53.166 --> 00:40:53.806]  Just search engine.
[00:40:54.046 --> 00:40:56.687]  Mexico's towards the top of best poor countries.
[00:40:56.867 --> 00:40:57.607]  Except for getting killed.
[00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:04.689]  I mean, you go to most really poor countries, folks, they're real scary.
[00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.331]  You go to Venezuela, they ate all their dogs and cats four years ago.
[00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:11.891]  They're eating people now.
[00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.952]  Thousands die a week of starvation.
[00:41:22.298 --> 00:41:23.599]  How you like beans and rice?
[00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:28.203]  Every day of the week for your whole life and maybe once a month some fish.
[00:41:28.744 --> 00:41:29.504]  Move to Cuba!
[00:41:33.287 --> 00:41:35.089]  How's you like squid seven days a week?
[00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:44.597]  Yeah, they ate the zoo animals a couple years ago.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.921]  Now they're eating the people.
[00:41:52.108 --> 00:41:56.371]  So, Trump says $50 billion.
[00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:59.193]  You want to ship the stolen crap in here?
[00:41:59.213 --> 00:42:00.794]  $50 billion tariff.
[00:42:01.054 --> 00:42:04.617]  And what's that going to make Walmart and everybody else do?
[00:42:04.657 --> 00:42:07.719]  They're going to turn around and start buying American-made stuff.
[00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:08.679]  So here's the deal.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.461]  Trump's standing up for America.
[00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:13.563]  He's taking action for the country.
[00:42:16.704 --> 00:42:20.105]  He's doing what he said he'd do, what you asked him to do.
[00:42:20.965 --> 00:42:23.146]  And I'm not even seeing enough support for the president.
[00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.566]  I want to see people put billboards up.
[00:42:25.846 --> 00:42:27.287]  I want to see people with sandwich boards up.
[00:42:27.547 --> 00:42:29.107]  I want to see people with blimps in the sky.
[00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:32.828]  I want to see airplanes with Trump is delivering behind it.
[00:42:33.308 --> 00:42:35.229]  I want you to understand he's our champion.
[00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:40.550]  And they bring him down, they're bringing it all down because they're scared now and realize we're awake.
[00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.431]  And they realize they're about to lose their whole system.
[00:42:44.386 --> 00:42:48.650]  But on every front, Trump is delivering in royal flush grandeur.
[00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.292]  We had better be thanking God right now.
[00:42:51.792 --> 00:42:54.635]  He just slapped John upside the head for stealing our property.
[00:42:55.996 --> 00:42:57.798]  Joe Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[00:42:57.858 --> 00:43:02.402]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:03.202 --> 00:43:04.884]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[00:43:04.904 --> 00:43:07.366]  Directed by the amazing director, Joe Gilbert.
[00:43:07.406 --> 00:43:08.207]  Here is the trailer.
[00:43:08.706 --> 00:43:12.929]  You call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:16.091]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:23.215]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:23.816]  Who cares?
[00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:25.697]  You haven't been called.
[00:43:25.737 --> 00:43:26.777]  Go back to Univision.
[00:43:27.958 --> 00:43:29.459]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[00:43:29.499 --> 00:43:30.440]  He's very low energy.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.061]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[00:43:35.216 --> 00:43:35.716]  Throw him out.
[00:43:35.956 --> 00:43:37.076]  Throw him out into the cold.
[00:43:37.396 --> 00:43:39.617]  Don't give him their coat.
[00:43:40.997 --> 00:43:42.658]  No coats.
[00:43:42.978 --> 00:43:44.358]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[00:43:44.378 --> 00:43:45.558]  Lying dead.
[00:43:45.678 --> 00:43:53.640]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.180]  The most dishonest human beings.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:57.901]  These people right here.
[00:43:57.921 --> 00:43:59.201]  Look at all the cameras.
[00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:03.974]  So disgusting!
[00:44:04.054 --> 00:44:06.035]  This socialist slash communist!
[00:44:06.456 --> 00:44:07.336]  Crazy Bernie.
[00:44:07.396 --> 00:44:08.918]  He's crazy as it may look.
[00:44:09.198 --> 00:44:12.120]  Pocahontas?
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.821]  The Indian?
[00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:13.982]  Very offensive!
[00:44:14.102 --> 00:44:15.483]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:44:15.503 --> 00:44:16.123]  Pocahontas?
[00:44:16.183 --> 00:44:19.226]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:19.306 --> 00:44:20.287]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[00:44:20.487 --> 00:44:22.569]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[00:44:27.933 --> 00:44:28.533]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:44:28.573 --> 00:44:30.215]  Politicians are really dishonest!
[00:44:32.074 --> 00:44:35.657]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:37.199]  This had nothing to do with me.
[00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:40.842]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[00:44:41.042 --> 00:44:43.164]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:45.146]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.507]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:48.749]  Because they were protecting him.
[00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:49.790]  I'm trying to be nice.
[00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.351]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[00:44:52.633 --> 00:44:54.214]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[00:44:54.454 --> 00:44:56.236]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[00:44:56.296 --> 00:44:57.457]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[00:44:59.198 --> 00:45:01.640]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.481]  It just doesn't work!
[00:45:02.521 --> 00:45:04.662]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[00:45:05.763 --> 00:45:07.625]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[00:45:07.665 --> 00:45:10.427]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:13.669]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[00:45:13.709 --> 00:45:16.992]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[00:45:17.272 --> 00:45:18.213]  Repeat after me.
[00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:21.055]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:45:21.115 --> 00:45:22.476]  That's not going to happen.
[00:45:23.017 --> 00:45:23.817]  So help me God.
[00:45:24.158 --> 00:45:25.479]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:45:31.568 --> 00:45:34.596]  We will make America great again!
[00:45:35.819 --> 00:45:36.882]  Go home to mommy.
[00:45:37.222 --> 00:45:38.445]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:40.290]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[00:45:41.621 --> 00:45:42.882]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[00:45:42.902 --> 00:45:43.663]  We've carried them all.
[00:45:43.943 --> 00:45:44.563]  We sell them all.
[00:45:44.583 --> 00:45:45.324]  They're all groundbreaking.
[00:45:45.344 --> 00:45:47.126]  But this one, this one is fun.
[00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:49.067]  And very, very celebratory.
[00:45:49.107 --> 00:45:51.629]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:52.490]  It's really a special film.
[00:45:53.571 --> 00:45:54.051]  Thanks a lot.
[00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:58.895]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[00:45:59.696 --> 00:46:02.378]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[00:46:03.019 --> 00:46:05.701]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[00:46:06.261 --> 00:46:18.767]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:22.228]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[00:46:22.288 --> 00:46:23.269]  That's why it stuck.
[00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:28.491]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[00:46:28.631 --> 00:46:29.572]  I thought I knew Trump.
[00:46:29.672 --> 00:46:30.492]  I studied Trump.
[00:46:30.952 --> 00:46:31.652]  I thought I knew him.
[00:46:32.173 --> 00:46:34.974]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[00:46:35.554 --> 00:46:36.715]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.459 --> 00:47:21.046]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:23.638]  Because there is a war on.
[00:47:23.698 --> 00:47:24.240]  Or you're mine.
[00:47:31.306 --> 00:47:50.956]  Ladies and gentlemen, our borders, our sovereignty, our stock market, our jobs, our industry, our families, our military, everything, Trump is doing his dead-level best from a classic, middle-of-the-road, Americana, Eisenhower, JFK-style administration.
[00:47:51.596 --> 00:47:54.277]  You're just getting classic Americana.
[00:47:55.078 --> 00:47:59.260]  And the globalists that had sold this country out and thought they were God are flipping out right now.
[00:48:00.543 --> 00:48:04.729]  Trump to slap China with $50 billion in tariffs over intellectual property theft.
[00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:11.978]  By the way, it's estimated with our $300-$400 billion a year trade deficit with China that it's even in excess of that per year.
[00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:13.821]  So this is going back decades.
[00:48:13.861 --> 00:48:15.343]  It should be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times that.
[00:48:17.973 --> 00:48:18.914]  Unbelievable.
[00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:29.186]  Trump taking action in our own media that sold us out, bitching and complaining and saying he's gonna destroy the economy, he's gonna destroy our industry.
[00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.848]  We didn't have anything left.
[00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:33.852]  It's all pouring back in now.
[00:48:34.613 --> 00:48:35.934]  Doesn't mean they're not gonna strike back.
[00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:37.877]  Doesn't mean it might not be too late.
[00:48:39.718 --> 00:48:45.844]  But they were involved in de-industrialization, post-industrial era, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[00:48:46.264 --> 00:48:47.225]  It's a plan.
[00:48:47.385 --> 00:48:48.106]  It's public.
[00:48:48.226 --> 00:48:49.347]  Trump has read it.
[00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:53.751]  Trump knew all this before I was ever on air.
[00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:57.014]  Trump's dad was a huge donor to the John Birch Society.
[00:48:58.195 --> 00:49:04.500]  His lawyer, Roy Cohn, was the head of the House and the Senate.
[00:49:05.101 --> 00:49:05.922]  He ran both of them.
[00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:09.530]  On American activities, he was McCarthy.
[00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:14.751]  Trump's best friend was McCarthy's power behind the throne.
[00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:16.692]  What does that tell you?
[00:49:17.012 --> 00:49:19.133]  The globalists are crapping themselves!
[00:49:19.613 --> 00:49:21.453]  He's the opposite of a Russian agent!
[00:49:21.773 --> 00:49:23.094]  That's why they're so scared!
[00:49:24.054 --> 00:49:25.795]  Everything he does is for the country!
[00:49:26.915 --> 00:49:30.376]  Everything he does is the classic default of what you do!
[00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:38.313]  It is just mind-blowing right now.
[00:49:43.218 --> 00:49:44.920]  We have a clip of the President speaking about this?
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.342]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:49:48.343 --> 00:49:48.964]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.689]  Gone.
[00:49:56.131 --> 00:49:57.912]  Six million jobs at least.
[00:49:59.094 --> 00:49:59.494]  Gone.
[00:50:00.638 --> 00:50:02.139]  And now they're starting to come back.
[00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:10.945]  You see what's happening with Chrysler, with Foxconn, with so many other companies wanting to come back into the United States.
[00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:16.369]  But we have one particular problem, and I view them as a friend.
[00:50:16.389 --> 00:50:20.232]  I have tremendous respect for President Xi.
[00:50:21.232 --> 00:50:22.533]  We have a great relationship.
[00:50:22.573 --> 00:50:26.596]  They're helping us a lot in North Korea.
[00:50:28.037 --> 00:50:28.878]  And that's China.
[00:50:30.882 --> 00:50:39.247]  But we have a trade deficit, depending on the way you calculate, of $504 billion.
[00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:45.050]  Now, some people would say it's really $375 billion.
[00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:56.096]  Many different ways of looking at it, but any way you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world.
[00:50:56.716 --> 00:50:57.837]  It's out of control.
[00:50:59.662 --> 00:51:12.745]  We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:15.945]  And that's on a yearly basis.
[00:51:17.266 --> 00:51:18.706]  I've spoken to the president.
[00:51:18.766 --> 00:51:22.487]  I've spoken to representatives of China.
[00:51:23.267 --> 00:51:25.687]  We've been dealing with it very seriously.
[00:51:25.767 --> 00:51:27.548]  As you know, we're renegotiating NAFTA.
[00:51:27.568 --> 00:51:28.688]  We'll see how that turns out.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:37.746]  Many countries are calling to negotiate better trade deals because they don't want to have to pay the steel and aluminum tariffs.
[00:51:37.766 --> 00:51:40.067]  So we are negotiating with various countries.
[00:51:40.187 --> 00:51:41.228]  By the way, this is live?
[00:51:41.448 --> 00:51:42.469]  Mr. Lighthizer.
[00:51:42.729 --> 00:51:44.270]  But we backed it up on the DVR.
[00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:44.911]  He's still live.
[00:51:45.251 --> 00:51:49.014]  We are just starting a negotiation with the European Union.
[00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:52.821]  Because they've really shut out our country to a large extent.
[00:51:52.861 --> 00:51:56.523]  They have barriers that they can trade with us, but we can't trade with them.
[00:51:56.804 --> 00:51:58.265]  Their tariffs are four times bigger than ours.
[00:51:58.285 --> 00:51:59.425]  They have very high tariffs.
[00:51:59.886 --> 00:52:00.286]  We don't.
[00:52:01.106 --> 00:52:01.947]  It's just not fair.
[00:52:02.047 --> 00:52:02.808]  Yeah, it's not fair!
[00:52:03.188 --> 00:52:09.192]  NAFTA's been a very bad deal for the United States, but we'll make it better, or we'll have to do something else.
[00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:15.776]  The deal we have with South Korea is a very one-sided deal.
[00:52:15.857 --> 00:52:17.318]  It's a deal that has to be changed.
[00:52:18.348 --> 00:52:25.672]  So we have a lot of things happening, but in particular with China, we're going to be doing a Section 301 trade action.
[00:52:27.454 --> 00:52:36.279]  It could be about $60 billion, but that's really just a fraction of what we're talking about.
[00:52:36.459 --> 00:52:36.859]  Exactly.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:44.604]  I've been speaking with the highest Chinese representatives, including the president,
[00:52:45.652 --> 00:52:50.313]  And I've asked them to reduce the trade deficit immediately by $100 billion.
[00:52:50.473 --> 00:52:51.854]  It's a lot.
[00:52:54.154 --> 00:52:58.515]  So that would be anywhere from 25%, depending on the way you figure.
[00:52:58.895 --> 00:52:59.696]  It's $400 billion.
[00:52:59.716 --> 00:53:03.857]  To maybe something even more than that, but we have to do that.
[00:53:04.157 --> 00:53:04.477]  Yeah!
[00:53:04.837 --> 00:53:06.917]  The word that I want to use is reciprocal.
[00:53:08.078 --> 00:53:11.198]  When they charge 25% for a car to go in,
[00:53:14.682 --> 00:53:19.005]  And we charge 2% for their car to come into the United States.
[00:53:19.465 --> 00:53:20.065]  That's not good.
[00:53:20.145 --> 00:53:20.706]  That's right!
[00:53:20.746 --> 00:53:21.626]  It's over, scum!
[00:53:21.766 --> 00:53:24.648]  That's how China rebuilt itself.
[00:53:24.888 --> 00:53:32.993]  The tremendous money that we've paid since the founding of the World Trade Organization, which has actually been a disaster for us.
[00:53:35.014 --> 00:53:36.235]  It's been very unfair to us.
[00:53:36.455 --> 00:53:38.936]  By the way, Lloyd Blankfein made a joke about this six months ago.
[00:53:39.317 --> 00:53:40.357]  He's out on his ass now.
[00:53:40.377 --> 00:53:41.318]  It's been very unfair.
[00:53:41.378 --> 00:53:42.398]  You like that, bitch?
[00:53:42.438 --> 00:53:43.039]  And knowingly.
[00:53:44.366 --> 00:53:46.627]  We always have a minority, and it's not fair.
[00:53:46.928 --> 00:53:53.572]  So, we're talking to World Trade, we're talking to NAFTA, we're talking to China, we're talking to the European Union.
[00:53:53.592 --> 00:53:55.012]  Yeah, this hate America crap is over, bitches!
[00:53:55.093 --> 00:53:58.054]  And I will say, every single one of them wants to negotiate.
[00:53:59.255 --> 00:54:05.479]  And I believe that in many cases, maybe all cases, we'll end up negotiating a deal.
[00:54:05.919 --> 00:54:10.362]  So we've spoken to China, and we're in the midst of a very large negotiation.
[00:54:11.411 --> 00:54:12.551]  We'll see where it takes us.
[00:54:12.872 --> 00:54:17.173]  But in the meantime, we're sending a Section 301 action.
[00:54:17.593 --> 00:54:19.514]  I'll be signing it right here, right now.
[00:54:20.195 --> 00:54:27.277]  I'd like to ask Bob Lighthizer to say a few words about the 301 and where we are in that negotiation.
[00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.358]  Trump is an answer to prayers.
[00:54:28.638 --> 00:54:31.699]  And we're doing things for this country.
[00:54:31.719 --> 00:54:32.619]  CNBC says it's a 50.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.660]  Trump says it's a 60.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:38.342]  For many, many years, we've had this abuse by many other countries.
[00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:44.166]  And groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United States.
[00:54:44.186 --> 00:54:44.446]  That's right.
[00:54:44.466 --> 00:54:45.467]  We don't want that to happen.
[00:54:45.487 --> 00:54:46.568]  We're not going to let that happen.
[00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:51.432]  It's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.
[00:54:52.232 --> 00:54:52.493]  Wow.
[00:54:52.513 --> 00:54:53.714]  But we're not going to let that happen.
[00:54:53.894 --> 00:54:54.234]  Wow.
[00:54:54.354 --> 00:54:58.998]  We have right now an $800 billion trade deficit with the world.
[00:55:00.579 --> 00:55:01.320]  So think of that.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.122]  So let's say we have $500 billion to $375 billion.
[00:55:04.142 --> 00:55:06.965]  But let's say we have $500 billion with China.
[00:55:09.633 --> 00:55:13.719]  But we have 800 total with the world.
[00:55:13.759 --> 00:55:15.481]  That would mean that China is more than half.
[00:55:15.862 --> 00:55:16.563]  I'll stop that term.
[00:55:18.684 --> 00:55:20.084]  Again, he's live right now.
[00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:21.045]  We backed up a few minutes.
[00:55:21.065 --> 00:55:22.565]  We're going to come back from break and play more.
[00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:29.027]  I have a bunch of guests coming on about them banning guns on YouTube for the general public, but not for Hollywood and the video game companies.
[00:55:29.987 --> 00:55:30.748]  So that's coming up.
[00:55:30.808 --> 00:55:32.188]  But this is huge.
[00:55:32.268 --> 00:55:33.849]  I mean, this is everything.
[00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:35.069]  And they think you're dumb.
[00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:36.889]  They go, oh, we have fair trade.
[00:55:36.909 --> 00:55:37.910]  They don't have tariffs on us.
[00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.691]  China has, as you heard, 20-something percent.
[00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:42.531]  We got 2 percent.
[00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:43.271]  Same thing with Europe.
[00:55:43.611 --> 00:55:45.172]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:51.303]  It's all, the only country that's actually been more fair is the one we used to get mad at, is Japan.
[00:55:51.923 --> 00:55:54.965]  They've got fairer deals, they built factories here, they're responding.
[00:55:55.325 --> 00:55:58.567]  South Korea not so much, China's really bad, EU's horrible.
[00:55:58.968 --> 00:55:59.568]  No more!
[00:56:00.569 --> 00:56:01.149]  No more!
[00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.791]  And, this is huge.
[00:56:05.372 --> 00:56:10.695]  And that's why they're pissed, because this deal was designed to destroy the United States, and it's over.
[00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:15.011]  And in the mind of Hillary, she thinks this is something they can just do forever.
[00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:16.112]  Well, no, it's not.
[00:56:18.193 --> 00:56:27.337]  So, briefly, just like America needs funding and Trump is trying to bring the jobs back and trying to cut the taxes and everything else that's happened, I need support.
[00:56:27.757 --> 00:56:31.838]  They know we're in a critical operation defending the President and the restoration of the Republic.
[00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:36.320]  The enemy is after us, but we will win if you get off the couch, if you get off the bench.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.502]  And many of you have, and I salute you, but you need to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:41.351 --> 00:57:01.795]  On our big, secure, high-tech shopping cart, and you need to look at all the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the supplements, the high-quality coffee, all of it, and shop with InfoWars, and we will, I give you this pledge, we will go on to the end, no matter what they do to me, no matter how they attack us, because the stuff they've been doing lately is nothing compared to what they've done to my family.
[00:57:02.275 --> 00:57:03.555]  I am committed 1,000%.
[00:57:04.895 --> 00:57:08.536]  These attacks have only galvanized me to a level never before!
[00:57:09.177 --> 00:57:10.199]  I am on fire!
[00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:11.603]  I can feel the spirit.
[00:57:11.703 --> 00:57:12.706]  I know you can as well.
[00:57:12.726 --> 00:57:15.092]  And the president and I have talked about that spirit.
[00:57:16.024 --> 00:57:17.364]  You are the fires of liberty.
[00:57:17.724 --> 00:57:20.085]  You are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.125]  You are victory!
[00:57:22.885 --> 00:57:29.646]  But I need to be flooded, flooded with capital to sue these people and launch new operations and satellites, because now is the time.
[00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:32.987]  Radio and TV stations across the country are now turning us on.
[00:57:33.347 --> 00:57:35.247]  People are spreading the articles and videos everywhere.
[00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:42.569]  If the globalists want a fight, I don't know how it's going to end, but they now know they've got one!
[00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:43.509]  Hour two!
[00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:44.489]  Spread the links!
[00:57:47.481 --> 00:57:52.165]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[00:57:52.666 --> 00:57:54.207]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[00:57:54.227 --> 00:57:57.530]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:57:59.251 --> 00:58:03.355]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[00:58:04.768 --> 00:58:08.371]  King, we want to first take him off the air, and then we're going to take everybody off.
[00:58:08.672 --> 00:58:09.472]  This is all admitted.
[00:58:09.532 --> 00:58:10.533]  I told you that a month ago.
[00:58:10.633 --> 00:58:11.854]  It's all happening, as you see.
[00:58:12.215 --> 00:58:14.977]  So, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, go there.
[00:58:14.997 --> 00:58:16.018]  Get the t-shirt of the month.
[00:58:16.098 --> 00:58:19.701]  Trump, Pence, 2020, with the new slogan, Keeping America Great.
[00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:20.782]  I haven't even done an ad for that.
[00:58:20.842 --> 00:58:21.363]  I'm so busy.
[00:58:21.403 --> 00:58:23.284]  That's a one-month limited edition shirt.
[00:58:23.444 --> 00:58:24.986]  It's gone in just a few weeks.
[00:58:25.186 --> 00:58:26.607]  That's at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:26.747 --> 00:58:29.470]  In these lawsuits, Alex, I know the costs.
[00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:33.971]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight the Pony lawsuits.
[00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:43.673]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight the lawsuits against you and against InfoWars, because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:55.876]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button at the InfoWars.com store.
[00:58:56.096 --> 00:58:56.436]  If you just
[00:58:56.496 --> 00:58:57.457]  We're good to go.
[00:59:21.397 --> 00:59:23.558]  Hit that donate button.
[00:59:23.618 --> 00:59:24.018]  Exactly.
[00:59:24.058 --> 00:59:27.478]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPB and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[00:59:27.498 --> 00:59:28.679]  We have the listeners doing it.
[00:59:28.779 --> 00:59:36.801]  And we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you, saying you're a Russian agent, and they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[00:59:36.841 --> 00:59:37.541]  We're winning.
[00:59:37.601 --> 00:59:38.821]  It's why they're targeting us.
[00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:42.182]  But people need to know, this is the war for this republic.
[00:59:42.202 --> 00:59:42.822]  This is it.
[00:59:49.701 --> 00:59:51.349]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:51.731 --> 00:59:53.158]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:04.756]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:07.058]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.213 --> 01:00:30.837]  To counter the communist Chinese trade deficit we have a 400 to 500 billion a year, a 50 to 60 billion dollar tariff starting immediately.
[01:00:31.197 --> 01:00:33.818]  Let's go back to the president who is still live.
[01:00:34.018 --> 01:00:35.979]  We froze it when we went to break, but he's live.
[01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:36.839]  This is a few minutes ago.
[01:00:36.879 --> 01:00:37.219]  Here it is.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:39.900]  Or a mirror tax.
[01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:42.961]  Just use the word reciprocal.
[01:00:43.982 --> 01:00:47.203]  If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.
[01:00:48.527 --> 01:00:49.487]  That's the way it's gotta be.
[01:00:49.547 --> 01:00:51.608]  That's not the way it is for many, many years.
[01:00:51.688 --> 01:00:53.709]  For many decades, it has not been that way.
[01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.913]  And I will say, the people we're negotiating with, smilingly, they really agree with us.
[01:01:01.113 --> 01:01:05.335]  I really believe, they cannot believe they've gotten away with this for so long.
[01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:11.998]  I'll talk to Prime Minister Abe of Japan and others.
[01:01:13.818 --> 01:01:14.839]  Great guy, friend of mine.
[01:01:15.987 --> 01:01:17.889]  And there'll be a little smile on their face.
[01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:26.916]  And the smile is, I can't believe we've been able to take advantage of the United States for so long.
[01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:28.437]  So those days are over.
[01:01:29.638 --> 01:01:31.660]  Ambassador Lighthizer, thank you.
[01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:35.472]  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.
[01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:51.161]  First of all, for those of you who don't know, Section 301 is a statute that gives substantial power or authority to the President to correct actions in certain circumstances or those unfair acts, policies, or practices by our trading partners.
[01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:54.684]  Trump's the real deal, everybody!
[01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:56.025]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:02:12.558 --> 01:02:16.562]  Given these problems, the President asked USTR to conduct a study.
[01:02:16.602 --> 01:02:17.923]  We conducted a thorough study.
[01:02:17.963 --> 01:02:18.664]  We had hearings.
[01:02:19.124 --> 01:02:21.987]  We reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents.
[01:02:22.027 --> 01:02:24.049]  We talked to many, many business people.
[01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:27.092]  And we found we're about to lose our dominance if we don't move now.
[01:02:27.432 --> 01:02:45.295]  We concluded that in fact China does have a policy of forced technology transfer, of requiring licensing at less than economic value, at state capitalism wherein they go in and buy technology in the United States in non-economic ways, and then finally of cyber theft.
[01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:49.298]  The result of this has been that the President has analyzed it.
[01:02:49.338 --> 01:02:51.579]  We have a 200-page study which we'll put out.
[01:02:52.099 --> 01:02:56.141]  And he has concluded that we should put in place tariffs on appropriate products.
[01:02:56.741 --> 01:02:59.802]  We can explain later how we concluded what products they are.
[01:03:00.202 --> 01:03:05.085]  That we would put investment restrictions on China with respect to high technology.
[01:03:05.445 --> 01:03:12.028]  And that we'll file a WTO case because one of the actions here does involve a WTO violation.
[01:03:12.528 --> 01:03:14.649]  This is an extremely important action.
[01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:23.456]  Because Apple just announced three weeks ago they're moving to Communist China and giving them all the keys, most of which were developed by taxpayer money at DARPA.
[01:03:25.137 --> 01:03:28.740]  So you have to understand, this is treason, ladies and gentlemen, by Apple.
[01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:29.221]  Continue.
[01:03:31.463 --> 01:03:38.028]  For the future of the country, really across industries, and I would really like to thank you very much, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to work on it.
[01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:39.209]  Thank you very much, Bob.
[01:03:39.529 --> 01:03:40.090]  Unbelievable.
[01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.051]  Secretary Ross.
[01:03:42.675 --> 01:03:45.576]  Intellectual property rights are our future.
[01:03:46.277 --> 01:03:51.159]  And it's no accident that in June of this year, the U.S.
[01:03:51.219 --> 01:03:55.881]  Patent and Trademark Office will issue its 10 millionth patent.
[01:03:56.701 --> 01:03:57.742]  10 million patents.
[01:03:57.782 --> 01:04:01.663]  There's no country in the history of the world that remotely... Okay, pause.
[01:04:01.683 --> 01:04:02.544]  We've got to take a break.
[01:04:02.824 --> 01:04:04.865]  Notice, all they're doing is talking the country up.
[01:04:06.446 --> 01:04:11.768]  And all they're doing is saying, you're not going to have giant tariffs on us, and then let's not have them on you.
[01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:15.808]  That's why the media beats you over the head that we'll die.
[01:04:15.828 --> 01:04:19.452]  The economy will implode if you do this.
[01:04:19.512 --> 01:04:20.854]  That's why they do it over and over again.
[01:04:22.376 --> 01:04:27.662]  Because this is how they brought the country down and how they parlayed all our wealth and all our industry.
[01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:30.571]  Into this whole global order.
[01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:42.594]  But here we are, the American people, Infowars, Trump, you, everybody, together, right at that magic point, when their world government was launching, and we were supposed to fall to take it all away from them.
[01:04:43.374 --> 01:04:45.014]  Almost like it was planned.
[01:04:48.435 --> 01:04:49.675]  That's right, my friends.
[01:04:49.795 --> 01:04:51.876]  You will be defeated, globalists.
[01:04:55.911 --> 01:04:59.112]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:04:59.573 --> 01:05:00.873]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:01.374 --> 01:05:12.799]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:13.579 --> 01:05:22.505]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:22.905 --> 01:05:33.613]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:34.133 --> 01:05:36.435]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:05:36.776 --> 01:05:38.137]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:48.147]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:48.247 --> 01:05:50.389]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:55.815]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:05:57.776 --> 01:05:58.876]  You've got it.
[01:05:59.136 --> 01:06:04.819]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:09.020]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.942]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:16.823 --> 01:06:18.824]  We see the earth.
[01:06:18.884 --> 01:06:20.884]  You've got it.
[01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:22.465]  We see the earth.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.884]  We have three guests joining us dealing with the war on the Second Amendment that has entered the most vicious phase since we fought for the right starting in 1776.
[01:06:45.004 --> 01:06:51.508]  And it's an attack on the First Amendment which is also the greatest ever seen.
[01:06:52.188 --> 01:06:53.408]  This is the assault.
[01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:54.369]  This is the war.
[01:06:54.769 --> 01:06:55.590]  This is the battle.
[01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:01.793]  Our Republic had been for at least 50 years under a globalist system
[01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:16.114]  Setting up 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 percent tariffs in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, to not allow U.S.
[01:07:16.154 --> 01:07:17.895]  manufacturing and U.S.
[01:07:17.935 --> 01:07:28.857]  jobs, so that we could be domesticated, so we could have a false economy, a service economy, a globalist economy, so these foreign corporations that had all that undue power
[01:07:30.106 --> 01:07:37.949]  Now, $800 to $900 billion a year trade deficit, and use that money to come in and buy us up.
[01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:41.110]  They were going to end all the free speech when Hillary got in.
[01:07:41.571 --> 01:07:43.031]  They were going to further implode the economy.
[01:07:43.051 --> 01:07:43.911]  It was all being announced.
[01:07:44.892 --> 01:07:52.675]  Patriots in our government, the American people and others, all came together to put Trump in, and he has been on an absolute kamikaze mission.
[01:07:54.113 --> 01:08:00.836]  No matter what they do to his family, no matter what they do to him, no matter how many hundreds of millions and billions he loses, he is dedicated.
[01:08:00.856 --> 01:08:04.237]  He made the decision three and a half years ago in Scotland.
[01:08:05.258 --> 01:08:08.719]  He had decided not to do it because it would hurt his family so bad.
[01:08:08.739 --> 01:08:10.620]  And his wife came to him.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.321]  And I've talked to folks that I knew about this before it was ever in Politico.
[01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:16.702]  And she said, you've got to do it.
[01:08:16.722 --> 01:08:17.362]  They're too evil.
[01:08:18.063 --> 01:08:18.703]  We're all ready.
[01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:20.804]  No matter how bad it gets, we're going to stand behind you.
[01:08:21.806 --> 01:08:27.511]  And they said he didn't really run, and he wasn't really real, and he wouldn't announce re-election, but it was running again.
[01:08:27.531 --> 01:08:29.613]  It's all lies, folks.
[01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.876]  Just like they tell you I'm not real or Trump's not real.
[01:08:33.336 --> 01:08:34.637]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:08:35.018 --> 01:08:37.620]  All InfoWars delivers is accuracy.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.102]  All we deliver is prosperity and victory.
[01:08:40.162 --> 01:08:40.763]  It's why they hate us.
[01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:46.868]  And I am incredibly honored to be this persecuted.
[01:08:46.888 --> 01:08:48.910]  It actually makes me stronger.
[01:08:53.342 --> 01:08:58.904]  I never enjoyed it, but I'm kind of getting to Trump level a little bit now, where it's actually empowering me.
[01:08:59.304 --> 01:09:05.547]  Instead of just dealing with it, I'm now going with it and trusting God completely, and I'm entering the Trump dimension.
[01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:07.308]  It's here, folks.
[01:09:07.748 --> 01:09:08.188]  It's happening.
[01:09:08.408 --> 01:09:22.394]  This is the big decision of all our ancestors, of us, of our future children, whether we're going to have worldwide authoritarianism and nightmares that make communism and Nazism and fascism and oligarchy look like a cakewalk.
[01:09:24.022 --> 01:09:29.264]  We can intellectually, we can spiritually, we can culturally pick up what's going on.
[01:09:29.304 --> 01:09:30.064]  We can see it.
[01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:34.646]  And we can see the attack on the First Amendment, the Second Amendment.
[01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:35.926]  We can see it all.
[01:09:37.367 --> 01:09:38.607]  And we know the choice we've got.
[01:09:39.487 --> 01:09:42.068]  And that's why they're trying to intimidate and shut us down everywhere.
[01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:53.112]  But we just all need to get active in every way, person to person, company to company, interfacing with God, praying every night, praying every morning for justice.
[01:09:54.155 --> 01:09:57.458]  You're not going to find it in these sold-out churches where they hired cowards that just wanted money.
[01:09:57.978 --> 01:09:59.499]  You're going to have to find God at 2 a.m.
[01:09:59.539 --> 01:10:00.019]  on your knees.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:00.880]  But it's here.
[01:10:01.981 --> 01:10:07.225]  And China, with its $400 to $500 billion a year trade deficit, depending on how you look at it.
[01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:13.370]  So you notice right before Trump went live, I said, it's $400 to $500 billion depending on how you look at it.
[01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:18.314]  They've got 20% tariffs on us, 15% tariffs, 30% tariffs.
[01:10:18.594 --> 01:10:19.434]  It's totally unfair.
[01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:20.355]  We need reciprocal.
[01:10:20.896 --> 01:10:22.116]  He comes out and gives that exact speech.
[01:10:22.317 --> 01:10:23.618]  We didn't line up talking points.
[01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:26.163]  The media keeps thinking Jones and Trump.
[01:10:26.704 --> 01:10:28.065]  Jones will be speaking while Trump's speaking.
[01:10:28.105 --> 01:10:29.005]  It's the exact same words.
[01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:30.466]  It's the truth!
[01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:32.008]  The truth!
[01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:36.831]  You don't have to get in a committee to find out what it is.
[01:10:36.911 --> 01:10:37.412]  It's there!
[01:10:41.755 --> 01:10:45.618]  And these globalists want to break America because we've got spirit.
[01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:48.400]  And they're slave masters.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.801]  But I got news for them.
[01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.642]  We've only begun to fight.
[01:10:53.203 --> 01:10:54.024]  And it's going to be rough.
[01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:56.151]  We're going to make it out of this.
[01:10:58.172 --> 01:11:00.393]  And we're going to use their own systems against them.
[01:11:00.413 --> 01:11:01.593]  And I'm going to explain that coming up.
[01:11:01.613 --> 01:11:03.494]  There's only a few minutes left.
[01:11:03.514 --> 01:11:04.354]  The speech is over now.
[01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:06.455]  He signed the action on China.
[01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.435]  He says $60 billion.
[01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:09.156]  The news is saying it's $50 billion.
[01:11:10.656 --> 01:11:13.437]  But I think the President probably knows right because he's got the document.
[01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:18.872]  Trump imposes $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports, accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft.
[01:11:19.092 --> 01:11:19.232]  Huh!
[01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:21.674]  Just like accusing a bear of taking a dump in the woods.
[01:11:22.714 --> 01:11:25.556]  Or Marilyn Monroe, or Prime, being a good-looking woman.
[01:11:27.638 --> 01:11:28.599]  Or fish in the sea.
[01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.160]  Birds in the sky.
[01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:32.842]  Mommy loves her baby.
[01:11:32.962 --> 01:11:35.824]  And the Communist Chinese are dirty and nasty scumbags.
[01:11:36.764 --> 01:11:38.806]  Perched on top, they're poor, hard-working people.
[01:11:39.693 --> 01:11:43.436]  He used his slaves for the globalists to leverage out the world and take over.
[01:11:44.016 --> 01:11:48.500]  Well, America woke up before you cut our heart out, and before you cut our brain out.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.264]  We were on the operating table, and we're still badly damaged and stumbling around.
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:59.808]  You've got us all on your government drugs and your Prozac and all your crap, but the spirit's rising.
[01:12:00.468 --> 01:12:05.372]  And just like day follows night, the sun is going to be rising.
[01:12:05.392 --> 01:12:08.615]  Let's finish this clip, go to break, and then get into the gun situation.
[01:12:08.655 --> 01:12:08.955]  Here it is.
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.892]  We've taken deal more or less with the present.
[01:12:14.432 --> 01:12:18.794]  This action on intellectual property rights deals with the future.
[01:12:19.275 --> 01:12:25.298]  So we're trying to solve both today's problem and problems that otherwise will be forthcoming.
[01:12:25.798 --> 01:12:31.221]  That's why these actions are so important and so important in unison with each other.
[01:12:31.922 --> 01:12:37.485]  We will end up negotiating these things rather than fighting over them in my view.
[01:12:39.454 --> 01:12:40.895]  Mike Pence, would you like to say something?
[01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:45.637]  Thank you, Mr. President, and to all our honored guests.
[01:12:45.677 --> 01:12:57.683]  Today's action sends a clear message that this president and our entire administration are determined to put American jobs and American workers first.
[01:12:58.824 --> 01:13:05.667]  The action the president will take today under Section 301 also makes it clear that economic surrender is over.
[01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:21.350]  The United States of America is taking targeted and focused action to protect not only American jobs, but America's technology, which will power and drive an innovation economy for decades to come.
[01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:27.536]  It is just one more step of a promise made and a promise kept by President Trump.
[01:13:30.336 --> 01:13:30.737]  There you go!
[01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:47.237]  For other countries also.
[01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:48.458]  Yeah, hit pause.
[01:13:48.518 --> 01:13:49.959]  We have some of our great business leaders.
[01:13:49.979 --> 01:13:51.540]  China won't have a market soon.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:58.104]  They were about to hit the austerity cliff where they were going to implode everything and the globalists take over with a worldwide reorganization.
[01:13:58.344 --> 01:14:00.325]  They were going to call it a planetary Marshall Plan.
[01:14:00.546 --> 01:14:01.726]  That's classified, by the way.
[01:14:02.867 --> 01:14:07.370]  A worldwide global Marshall Plan with Soros and others and Davos at the top.
[01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.511]  That's not happening now.
[01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.947]  Now, will this be a perfect transition?
[01:14:12.007 --> 01:14:15.708]  No, but at least we're not getting chained up and thrown in some political basement.
[01:14:16.028 --> 01:14:17.009]  At least we're fighting back.
[01:14:18.689 --> 01:14:19.150]  You understand?
[01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:22.551]  I don't know how this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you're going to get one.
[01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:22.931]  Here it is.
[01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:26.972]  And leaders, period, right behind me.
[01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:38.077]  I may ask Marilyn Lockheed, the leading woman's business executive in this country, according to many.
[01:14:39.219 --> 01:14:44.561]  And we buy billions and billions of dollars worth of that beautiful F-35.
[01:14:44.701 --> 01:14:46.482]  It's stealth.
[01:14:46.702 --> 01:14:47.623]  You cannot see it.
[01:14:47.703 --> 01:14:48.323]  Is that correct?
[01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:49.023]  That's correct.
[01:14:49.043 --> 01:14:50.004]  Better be correct, right?
[01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:50.344]  Absolutely.
[01:14:50.384 --> 01:14:54.245]  Marilyn, please say a few words.
[01:14:54.425 --> 01:14:57.947]  I would just say that this is a very important moment for our country.
[01:14:58.727 --> 01:14:59.507]  Thank you, ma'am.
[01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:26.783]  They thought they were stealing the plane.
[01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:28.064]  They didn't know it was satellite weapons.
[01:15:28.164 --> 01:15:29.264]  It looked like it was a front four.
[01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:32.225]  I think the Chinese do know that, though.
[01:15:32.965 --> 01:15:34.226]  And here he is, signing it.
[01:15:34.346 --> 01:15:35.446]  This is the first of many.
[01:15:36.086 --> 01:15:36.826]  The first of many.
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:39.347]  This is number one, but this is the first of many.
[01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:43.128]  The promise keeper delivering.
[01:15:44.148 --> 01:15:45.289]  No more one-way street.
[01:15:45.329 --> 01:15:46.609]  No more screwing America over.
[01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.990]  That's why they're moving against us, folks, because we are winning.
[01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:52.191]  Stay with us.
[01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:52.731]  There it is.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:09.294]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:11.777 --> 01:16:17.883]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:19.306 --> 01:16:21.807]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:22.628 --> 01:16:26.029]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:29.151]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:36.075]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:37.976 --> 01:16:44.599]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:46.540]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:54.781]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:56.602]  I expected that to happen.
[01:16:57.762 --> 01:16:59.103]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:01.095 --> 01:17:12.038]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:12.738 --> 01:17:14.279]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:26.602]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:27.162 --> 01:17:29.363]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:30.407 --> 01:17:39.409]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:39.969 --> 01:17:45.390]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:54.392]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:17:56.638 --> 01:18:04.905]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:06.886]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:07.887 --> 01:18:10.529]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:13.151]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:18.095]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:19.176 --> 01:18:29.973]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:30.013 --> 01:18:33.979]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:35.385 --> 01:18:36.046]  Our game changing.
[01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:37.967]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:38.187 --> 01:18:40.749]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[01:18:41.129 --> 01:18:42.290]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.912]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PolarStore.com.
[01:18:46.212 --> 01:18:51.736]  We've got the real red pill that's got preglanone that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:55.518]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:18:55.538 --> 01:18:56.659]  It just does incredible things.
[01:18:57.079 --> 01:18:58.560]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.541]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:01.561 --> 01:19:04.163]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:04.623 --> 01:19:09.446]  That's 4-5 colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:10.086 --> 01:19:12.748]  We now have not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue
[01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:21.214]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[01:19:21.655 --> 01:19:28.560]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.881]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:31.282]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:37.908]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:38.248 --> 01:19:39.649]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:49.273]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWorksStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:49.573 --> 01:19:52.655]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:19:59.038 --> 01:20:01.639]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.101]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:20:23.141 --> 01:20:24.641]  We are seeing history happen.
[01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:37.085]  Everybody's asking, how is Trump going to strike back against the globalist and communist China funding the Democratic Party, quarterbacking the breakdown of our sovereignty, the destruction of our industry, the theft of our military and technological secrets?
[01:20:37.785 --> 01:20:47.547]  Well, he just put a $60 billion tariff on them, and that is one of many until they come to the negotiating table and stop.
[01:20:47.587 --> 01:20:50.708]  He's got Saudi Arabia to stop funding the globalists and the leftists.
[01:20:51.008 --> 01:20:51.608]  That's on record.
[01:20:51.968 --> 01:20:52.969]  They've completely rolled over.
[01:20:55.609 --> 01:20:58.070]  Because the globalists were in control of America, of course they rolled over.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.721]  Now China is going to roll over, or they're going to get their teeth kicked in.
[01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:07.041]  And by the way, there's nothing they can do.
[01:21:07.442 --> 01:21:15.923]  That's why Clapper and Brenham and all these traitors that are on the Communist Chinese payroll on record, and the Wahhabist payroll, already got their asses handed to them.
[01:21:16.423 --> 01:21:21.704]  So we're all sitting here worried about their little stupid lawsuits and censoring us and all this, and we should be upset about it.
[01:21:22.204 --> 01:21:23.784]  That's their death flails.
[01:21:25.285 --> 01:21:26.725]  That's them flailing around.
[01:21:28.953 --> 01:21:30.553]  And it doesn't mean they're not going to try to kill the President.
[01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:32.314]  And it doesn't mean we're not in danger.
[01:21:32.374 --> 01:21:34.914]  But we are fighting back.
[01:21:34.934 --> 01:21:40.636]  So no matter what happens to Trump, or myself, or others, you are the resistance of every race, color, and creed.
[01:21:40.936 --> 01:21:42.256]  This is the return of America.
[01:21:42.616 --> 01:21:45.077]  America's surrender is over!
[01:21:46.257 --> 01:21:47.137]  As Pence said.
[01:21:49.578 --> 01:21:52.839]  Now, this is not an attack on the First Amendment that's happening.
[01:21:53.739 --> 01:21:56.179]  This is an attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.580]  And it's an attack on every other amendment.
[01:22:00.555 --> 01:22:05.519]  But when I say it's not an attack on the First Amendment, that's already under total attack.
[01:22:06.359 --> 01:22:08.461]  This attack on the first is to get the second.
[01:22:08.701 --> 01:22:14.025]  Because if they can shut down our free speech on YouTube, Facebook, everywhere, and kill the gun culture, they think they're going to win.
[01:22:14.525 --> 01:22:16.247]  But it really is an attack on them all.
[01:22:19.129 --> 01:22:23.072]  And we've got the Hong Kong Stock Exchange down 1.90 points.
[01:22:23.132 --> 01:22:23.852]  It's all going to happen.
[01:22:23.892 --> 01:22:24.333]  It's a war.
[01:22:24.553 --> 01:22:25.173]  It's what it's about.
[01:22:25.794 --> 01:22:26.975]  We'll see who blinks first.
[01:22:29.073 --> 01:22:32.497]  And I'll show Trump signing this, but then I want to get into where we're going next segment.
[01:22:32.837 --> 01:22:40.206]  With the people banned off YouTube, the announcement of no guns on YouTube, unless you're Twitch, or you're Hollywood, or you're violent garbage, then it's allowed.
[01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:42.909]  But any other citizens out shooting guns, that's banned.
[01:22:43.717 --> 01:22:47.060]  That's an attack on the Second Amendment via free speech.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.881]  But it's also an attack on free speech.
[01:22:49.122 --> 01:22:49.482]  It's both.
[01:22:49.922 --> 01:22:52.164]  But it's being done to get the Second Amendment.
[01:22:52.805 --> 01:22:54.526]  But it sets the President for the first as well.
[01:22:54.746 --> 01:22:55.847]  This is so draconian.
[01:22:56.187 --> 01:22:57.408]  This is so discriminatory.
[01:22:57.729 --> 01:22:58.690]  It's ripe for lawsuits.
[01:22:58.710 --> 01:22:59.350]  We'll break it down.
[01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:04.855]  But right now, let's show the President, just minutes ago, signing the executive action.
[01:23:05.535 --> 01:23:11.740]  Let's roll it.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.121]  $60 billion.
[01:23:14.343 --> 01:23:16.684]  This is number one, but this is the first of many.
[01:23:18.044 --> 01:23:29.028]  You see it all.
[01:23:29.748 --> 01:23:39.251]  Stabilize the country, pop up the stock market 40%, bring back hundreds of billions of new jobs, break the back of the globalists, cut off their funding.
[01:23:42.153 --> 01:23:43.673]  They go into faith too.
[01:23:43.793 --> 01:23:45.014]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:45.074 --> 01:23:46.194]  Run over the shycombs.
[01:23:47.915 --> 01:23:56.979]  Russia is sitting on the sidelines saying we don't want to fight even when US forces bomb Russian troops and kill a bunch of them.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.102]  They won't even put it in the Russian news hardly because they don't want to get in a conflict that Russia is trying to stay out of this.
[01:24:05.219 --> 01:24:08.060]  And there's a deal to work with Russia economically once the U.S.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:08.580]  is secured.
[01:24:08.981 --> 01:24:11.442]  And that's why the globalists are so pissed!
[01:24:12.742 --> 01:24:14.443]  They are so upset, they are so scared.
[01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:24.167]  Now, this is an enough video that was put out a few years ago, and then a great YouTuber, who I'll give some credit to in a minute, I've got their handle.
[01:24:24.187 --> 01:24:28.229]  I want to plug where you can actually find the original video if you want to watch it without my interruptions.
[01:24:30.046 --> 01:24:36.032]  Put the Enough Movement clips in with the very Hollywood stars misusing guns and talking about gun violence.
[01:24:36.232 --> 01:24:40.476]  So they're going to ban people like the Military Arms Channel and others just showing guns they don't even sell.
[01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:46.982]  If they're going to do that, then we're going to go to this video first.
[01:24:48.443 --> 01:24:52.788]  Then they're going to have to ban the video game ads, they're going to have to ban the
[01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:57.585]  Twitch games are going to have to ban the trailers for guns.
[01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.045]  All of it.
[01:24:58.346 --> 01:24:59.067]  They're hypocrites.
[01:24:59.267 --> 01:25:06.156]  They can't say you can't go shoot guns on YouTube and we're going to ban you because you can't show guns when all they do is show guns and violence improperly.
[01:25:06.496 --> 01:25:09.661]  It's like not making the gay couple the take but a trillion times bigger.
[01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:10.221]  Here it is.
[01:25:11.463 --> 01:25:12.024]  Columbine.
[01:25:25.834 --> 01:25:27.274]  I like the way you die, boy.
[01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:30.435]  Kill all the white people in the movie.
[01:25:30.535 --> 01:25:34.056]  How great is that?
[01:25:35.176 --> 01:25:35.816]  Virginia Tech.
[01:25:41.238 --> 01:25:41.818]  Tucson.
[01:25:42.178 --> 01:25:42.638]  Aurora.
[01:25:45.439 --> 01:25:45.979]  Fort Hood.
[01:25:46.519 --> 01:25:47.119]  Oak Creek.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:50.840]  Newtown.
[01:25:57.506 --> 01:25:57.906]  Newtown.
[01:26:03.429 --> 01:26:03.809]  Newtown.
[01:26:06.851 --> 01:26:07.291]  Newtown.
[01:26:09.072 --> 01:26:09.593]  How many more?
[01:26:12.394 --> 01:26:12.954]  How many more?
[01:26:13.274 --> 01:26:14.415]  How many more colleges?
[01:26:17.617 --> 01:26:18.797]  How many more classrooms?
[01:26:20.178 --> 01:26:21.019]  Okay, okay.
[01:26:21.039 --> 01:26:22.720]  I can understand why people like that.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.380]  How many more movie theaters?
[01:26:24.521 --> 01:26:24.981]  Here we go.
[01:26:29.409 --> 01:26:32.311]  So they're all anti-gun, but they show their improper use.
[01:26:32.351 --> 01:26:33.852]  How many more houses of faith?
[01:26:34.132 --> 01:26:35.813]  Yeah, that's gangster style.
[01:26:36.153 --> 01:26:37.454]  How many more shopping malls?
[01:26:37.674 --> 01:26:38.114]  Let's kill it.
[01:26:38.394 --> 01:26:41.076]  You talking to me, bitch?
[01:26:41.236 --> 01:26:42.117]  Easy there, fella.
[01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.017]  Okay.
[01:26:43.077 --> 01:26:45.399]  My arm!
[01:26:45.739 --> 01:26:47.180]  How many more street corners?
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.180]  How many more?
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.141]  How many more?
[01:26:49.661 --> 01:26:49.961]  Enough.
[01:26:50.522 --> 01:26:50.782]  Enough.
[01:26:50.802 --> 01:26:51.802]  It's kinda cool, actually.
[01:26:53.123 --> 01:26:53.423]  Enough.
[01:26:54.184 --> 01:26:54.384]  Enough.
[01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:01.652]  Demand a plan.
[01:27:02.272 --> 01:27:02.773]  Right now.
[01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:04.154]  As a mom.
[01:27:09.638 --> 01:27:10.199]  As a dad.
[01:27:10.719 --> 01:27:11.340]  As a friend.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.561]  As a husband.
[01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:13.562]  As a wife.
[01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:15.503]  As an American.
[01:27:18.846 --> 01:27:19.587]  As an American.
[01:27:20.347 --> 01:27:21.488]  As an American.
[01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.270]  As a human being.
[01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.813]  For the children of Sandy Hook.
[01:27:32.574 --> 01:27:33.535]  Demand a plan.
[01:27:39.901 --> 01:27:40.742]  Okay, there's more.
[01:27:40.802 --> 01:27:43.024]  That's Mike Hunt's channel on YouTube.
[01:27:43.044 --> 01:27:51.132]  They'll probably ban that for showing guns, because they can selectively say, showing any guns, even if you're not even selling them, we claim it promotes them, you'll be banned.
[01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:52.414]  Okay?
[01:27:54.161 --> 01:27:58.429]  But then Hollywood can have all the ads they want on YouTube and Facebook and Google.
[01:27:58.809 --> 01:28:01.374]  They can show guns being misused properly.
[01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:03.437]  They can do it all.
[01:28:03.718 --> 01:28:04.539]  Demand a plan!
[01:28:05.956 --> 01:28:09.798]  So that is the name of the video there on Mike Hunt's channel.
[01:28:10.138 --> 01:28:11.078]  You'll see that for yourself.
[01:28:11.658 --> 01:28:13.179]  So that's what they're up to.
[01:28:13.939 --> 01:28:21.862]  But imagine what the courts are going to do when they're banning you having a site properly showing how to use firearms, but everybody else has their speech.
[01:28:22.223 --> 01:28:26.364]  The video games, Twitch, all of them with their ESPN deals and their Amazon deals.
[01:28:26.944 --> 01:28:28.025]  Under this yardstick,
[01:28:28.405 --> 01:28:29.706]  Twitch has to be shut down.
[01:28:30.067 --> 01:28:33.370]  YouTube has to be sued for showing guns being improperly used.
[01:28:33.711 --> 01:28:38.716]  If us showing guns causes mass shootings, then YouTube is most guilty for killing children.
[01:28:38.776 --> 01:28:39.737]  Google is.
[01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:41.679]  And we're not calling for taking their speech.
[01:28:42.019 --> 01:28:43.061]  They're taking ours.
[01:28:43.501 --> 01:28:45.063]  We're pointing out this isn't fair.
[01:28:45.503 --> 01:28:46.965]  What are the gamers and people going to do?
[01:28:47.585 --> 01:28:49.487]  Probably call for us to be shut down because you don't care.
[01:28:49.547 --> 01:28:49.928]  You love it.
[01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.965]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:28:58.585 --> 01:29:02.148]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:29:02.548 --> 01:29:05.510]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:29:05.890 --> 01:29:07.871]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:12.855]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:29:13.175 --> 01:29:15.236]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:21.921]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:22.521 --> 01:29:29.747]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:35.372]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:29:35.773 --> 01:29:42.759]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:29:43.419 --> 01:29:47.863]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWars Life.
[01:29:48.324 --> 01:29:51.467]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:58.894]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:59.435 --> 01:30:06.842]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:30:07.522 --> 01:30:12.226]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:30:12.847 --> 01:30:14.749]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:30:15.369 --> 01:30:18.792]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:30:19.593 --> 01:30:22.075]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:29.418]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:37.226]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:30:38.087 --> 01:30:44.750]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:46.411]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:30:46.771 --> 01:30:48.632]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[01:30:49.412 --> 01:30:52.393]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.734]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:55.095 --> 01:30:57.416]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.
[01:30:57.436 --> 01:30:59.176]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:30:59.597 --> 01:31:02.418]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:31:03.527 --> 01:31:14.574]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:31:15.014 --> 01:31:24.140]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:30.183]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:31:30.403 --> 01:31:35.565]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:31:35.826 --> 01:31:37.807]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:31:38.107 --> 01:31:40.128]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:31:41.393 --> 01:31:44.195]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:45.796]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:31:46.436 --> 01:31:48.998]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:51.719]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.521]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[01:31:59.298 --> 01:32:02.379]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:32:02.419 --> 01:32:02.939]  You're on the air.
[01:32:02.959 --> 01:32:03.499]  Thanks for holding.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:04.980]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:05.800]  Hey, brother.
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.460]  Good, man.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.281]  Thank you for calling.
[01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:12.443]  Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:32:12.643 --> 01:32:19.025]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:32:19.145 --> 01:32:20.865]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[01:32:20.945 --> 01:32:27.108]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:32:28.368 --> 01:32:29.369]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:32:29.429 --> 01:32:33.451]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:32:33.832 --> 01:32:35.513]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:32:35.893 --> 01:32:36.633]  And exactly.
[01:32:36.653 --> 01:32:40.896]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:32:41.256 --> 01:32:41.536]  Boom!
[01:32:41.657 --> 01:32:44.478]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:32:44.538 --> 01:32:45.079]  It's amazing.
[01:32:45.119 --> 01:32:49.361]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:32:58.913 --> 01:33:01.539]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.459 --> 01:33:35.330]  If you're a history buff like I am, just because it's so interesting, you know we're living in one of the most historical times in human experience.
[01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:36.271]  This is it.
[01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:47.983]  They're coming after the first, they're coming after the second, they're coming after our sovereignty, and they were supposed to totally take the country over this year, the globalists, with Chinese communists backing it.
[01:33:49.639 --> 01:34:08.146]  And then there's Trump and all these other nationalists popping up, all over the world, like I said, from Brazil, with a super patriot, wants a Second Amendment down there, 20 points ahead all the other candidates, Second Amendment guy, saying he wants to model it after our Declaration of Independence, you've got that happening in Eastern Europe, it's just everywhere!
[01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:18.170]  Russia's cutting taxes, we're starting to pull back its gun laws, it's crazy, but then here comes Soros and the globalists,
[01:34:19.582 --> 01:34:27.528]  And they banned our next guest, Tim Harmson, Military Arms Channel, three weeks ago during our ban.
[01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.592]  And then just knocked his channel down.
[01:34:32.612 --> 01:34:33.312]  We'll get the latest.
[01:34:33.592 --> 01:34:41.098]  But now, they've banned Spikes Tactical and hundreds and hundreds of others saying, you can't show guns, you can't promote guns.
[01:34:41.839 --> 01:34:42.999]  But Hollywood and
[01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:48.339]  Twitch, and all these big things can show senseless violence, murder, death.
[01:34:48.579 --> 01:34:49.839]  I'm not calling for their censorship.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:59.285]  The point is, Hollywood wants to have its cake and eat it too, where we don't show violence, we don't show death, we don't even show stuff improperly, but we're getting banned, but they can't.
[01:35:01.887 --> 01:35:08.531]  YouTube right now has taken up of a million dollars, it's being reported, of money from the remake of Death Wish.
[01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:11.971]  Which I think has a good message overall, and I like Bruce Willis.
[01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:12.491]  He's a listener.
[01:35:12.971 --> 01:35:13.551]  He's a patriot.
[01:35:13.571 --> 01:35:14.932]  I'm not for censoring him and his movie.
[01:35:15.592 --> 01:35:17.853]  But Hollywood promotes stuff just randomly killing cops.
[01:35:17.893 --> 01:35:18.293]  You name it.
[01:35:18.613 --> 01:35:21.154]  They got shows on Netflix celebrating the Unabomber right now.
[01:35:21.174 --> 01:35:22.775]  Am I saying censor that?
[01:35:22.835 --> 01:35:23.055]  No!
[01:35:23.415 --> 01:35:24.516]  But don't take my rights.
[01:35:24.576 --> 01:35:27.137]  This is First Amendment full-on assault.
[01:35:27.437 --> 01:35:28.918]  But mainstream media won't admit that.
[01:35:29.238 --> 01:35:32.439]  And they misrepresent what we're saying in the news when they talk about the band.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.902]  We'll talk to Tim for the rest of the hour here in a moment.
[01:35:36.542 --> 01:35:39.744]  And then we've got the folks from Spice Tactical that happens to be a sponsor on.
[01:35:40.405 --> 01:35:43.867]  And YouTube's told everybody, you don't show them, you don't show guns, or you're banned.
[01:35:44.427 --> 01:35:47.209]  So that's where we are in America, all selective.
[01:35:47.269 --> 01:35:49.691]  First off though, speaking of funding.
[01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:58.150]  If you go to third party sites like Power Reviews and others, our supplements are listed on the internet as amongst the top 2%.
[01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:05.551]  Because I know I'm already targeted by regulators, I know they're already testing everything, plus I want you to get really good stuff so you like it and use it over and over again.
[01:36:06.792 --> 01:36:12.073]  We have the best supplements at InfoWarstore.com and I always have them print me off reviews, I never read them because I'm so busy.
[01:36:12.473 --> 01:36:16.453]  Go read the reviews on the 70 plus products we've developed the last six years.
[01:36:17.934 --> 01:36:19.354]  Go look at why they're so popular.
[01:36:20.367 --> 01:36:21.069]  They'll find out.
[01:36:21.129 --> 01:36:23.838]  And if you've been a supporter and you bought product and liked it...
[01:36:24.761 --> 01:36:25.342]  Do it again.
[01:36:25.522 --> 01:36:26.563]  Sign up for auto shipping.
[01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:27.223]  An additional 10% off.
[01:36:27.243 --> 01:36:28.624]  There are already big discounts.
[01:36:28.984 --> 01:36:32.087]  We have products discounted 25 to 50% and that's real.
[01:36:32.107 --> 01:36:33.428]  We don't raise the price and then lower.
[01:36:33.468 --> 01:36:37.671]  We have a base price that's a good deal, but a lot of times it's 25 to 50% off.
[01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:48.020]  We've got a lot of products up there from just basic high quality, best source fiber to X2, Survival Shield, pure iodine, not the garbage iodine that's so critical.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.402]  The Super Mill Vitality, 25% off.
[01:36:50.822 --> 01:36:52.343]  MycoZX, sold out for months now.
[01:36:52.403 --> 01:36:53.764]  MycoZX Plus, stronger.
[01:36:54.784 --> 01:36:55.525]  And a lower price.
[01:36:55.585 --> 01:36:56.946]  I signed a year contract to get more of it.
[01:36:57.326 --> 01:36:59.527]  This throws sand in the Globalist's gears.
[01:36:59.828 --> 01:37:04.391]  They can't stand they're trying to shut us down with demonization and lies and lawsuits.
[01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:07.773]  And, you know, we've got six of their suits thrown out because they were so frivolous.
[01:37:07.793 --> 01:37:09.574]  They filed six more that are even more frivolous.
[01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:13.437]  And we can beat them pretty inexpensively, but a bunch of them is expensive.
[01:37:13.957 --> 01:37:14.097]  So.
[01:37:15.222 --> 01:37:18.603]  I know you've already done it, but InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:19.103 --> 01:37:20.784]  Get in there, check out the products.
[01:37:20.824 --> 01:37:24.085]  The Vitamin Mineral Fusion with amino acids for you and your family, your children.
[01:37:24.666 --> 01:37:30.948]  Great tasting fruit punch, where they drink the multivitamin, multimineral, and they get a bigger absorption rate.
[01:37:31.288 --> 01:37:34.149]  $50 off the Alex Pure Breeze.
[01:37:34.369 --> 01:37:36.090]  Great air filtration system.
[01:37:36.370 --> 01:37:38.311]  Leading competitors are twice to three times the price.
[01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:40.972]  When it's not discounted to $200, at $150 it's insane.
[01:37:41.052 --> 01:37:45.253]  I know the unit costs like $90, so we're making like $30, they're making like $30.
[01:37:45.574 --> 01:37:50.976]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:51.316 --> 01:37:55.397]  These are great deals, but it's financial.
[01:37:55.457 --> 01:37:59.179]  We need the financial support, because look, you don't stay the same size.
[01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:00.439]  You implode or you grow.
[01:38:00.919 --> 01:38:04.201]  We've been growing exponentially in who we reach, not in our size.
[01:38:04.997 --> 01:38:09.681]  We're trying to expand because we have to work twice as hard to get past the censorship, which we do.
[01:38:10.382 --> 01:38:14.806]  When I stay up here 16 hours, we get more views and more than ever.
[01:38:15.686 --> 01:38:24.654]  But I gotta talk to station owners and TV station owners and I gotta talk to sponsors and I gotta shoot videos and I gotta shoot articles and I gotta deal with, you know, mad bombers running around the parking lot.
[01:38:24.674 --> 01:38:27.917]  I mean, I don't want to get into it, but believe me, it's not just what you see on the news around here.
[01:38:28.017 --> 01:38:28.898]  It's cuckoo land.
[01:38:29.878 --> 01:38:32.379]  But, there's not just bad guys in this world, there's a lot of good people.
[01:38:32.919 --> 01:38:34.780]  And this evil coming in is waking folks up.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.841]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:41.562]  Now, that means you've got to go out and seek the gun channels you like.
[01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:44.843]  You've got to go out and seek, because they're suing the gun manufacturers, everybody.
[01:38:45.463 --> 01:38:48.124]  It's a good thing you keep buying guns, because this is a war.
[01:38:49.405 --> 01:38:50.825]  Look, let me just put it to you this way.
[01:38:51.485 --> 01:38:53.986]  YouTube bans firearms demos, that's Bloomberg.
[01:38:55.027 --> 01:38:58.628]  And it lists the military arms channel, it lists Spikes Tactical, they're coming up.
[01:38:59.491 --> 01:39:02.132]  All this is going on, and they say, oh, it's just a policy change.
[01:39:02.152 --> 01:39:02.532]  No big deal.
[01:39:02.712 --> 01:39:03.433]  We do them all the time.
[01:39:04.033 --> 01:39:19.019]  Not where you say a whole class of people showing firearms is banned, even if you're not selling them, and then you let everybody else have guns and weapons if they're liberals, and have antifa hitting people in the head with bike locks, and antifa walking around with semi-automatic rifles, not letting people demonstrate in Austin.
[01:39:19.639 --> 01:39:23.301]  So, Tim Harmson joins us from Military Arms Channel.
[01:39:24.221 --> 01:39:26.822]  I know the site's been up and down to give us the status.
[01:39:26.882 --> 01:39:27.942]  I know Spikes is gone.
[01:39:27.982 --> 01:39:28.943]  They admit they took it down.
[01:39:30.543 --> 01:39:33.784]  This is the greatest attack on the First Amendment and Second Amendment.
[01:39:33.924 --> 01:39:36.825]  Everything we're seeing right now that has happened in our history, in my view.
[01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:40.786]  So Tim, what would you call this point we're at, and what's the current state of your channel?
[01:39:40.806 --> 01:39:42.127]  It was taken down a few weeks ago.
[01:39:43.287 --> 01:39:46.308]  Thousands of channels were, a lot of them went back up, but the new purge is here.
[01:39:46.728 --> 01:39:48.009]  What do you think the tactic is?
[01:39:48.049 --> 01:39:48.889]  Just wearing us out?
[01:39:50.706 --> 01:39:57.953]  Yeah, so first of all, my channel is back up, but YouTube has rolled out or made a public announcement that in 30 days they're going to implement new policies.
[01:39:58.573 --> 01:40:08.842]  And these new policies outline a number of different things that are somewhat ambiguous, and none of us are really sure what it means, but one of the first people to fall victim to this is your next guest, which is Spikes Tactical.
[01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:12.886]  You know, they have their channel unceremoniously disabled.
[01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:14.747]  And they don't even give a reason why.
[01:40:14.847 --> 01:40:17.829]  And that's happening across the firearm space in the YouTube community.
[01:40:17.869 --> 01:40:25.013]  So now they've never really had published guidelines for what firearms channels can and cannot do.
[01:40:25.093 --> 01:40:33.417]  So now they've published these policies, which take effect in less than 30 days now, since it was a couple of days ago when this actually broke.
[01:40:34.378 --> 01:40:37.019]  But what we're looking at, we don't really know.
[01:40:37.579 --> 01:40:40.161]  Because when we seek clarification from YouTube,
[01:40:41.057 --> 01:40:48.941]  We get a bunch of, you know, half answers and we'll, this shouldn't be a problem, this shouldn't be an issue, but we can't get a solid answer.
[01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:54.584]  But then you read it, it's anything that promotes gun sales, even if you're not selling it, so it's totally selectively enforced.
[01:40:55.586 --> 01:40:56.087]  Exactly.
[01:40:56.147 --> 01:40:57.788]  So it's open-ended.
[01:40:57.889 --> 01:41:01.072]  It's like the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Sporting Purposes Clause.
[01:41:01.372 --> 01:41:05.076]  It's open-ended for interpretation down the road, and it's just like a catch-all.
[01:41:05.376 --> 01:41:14.006]  If they don't like you, they don't like what you're saying, like Spikes Tactical, they can just cite these policies and unplug you, because they are so ambiguous.
[01:41:14.606 --> 01:41:19.889]  And so, do I think that once these are implemented that all gun channels are going to be immediately turned off?
[01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:21.070]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:27.254]  I think what they're doing is setting the stage for just gradually getting rid of the biggest problems.
[01:41:27.274 --> 01:41:28.134]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:41:28.294 --> 01:41:29.035]  It's a cold war.
[01:41:30.399 --> 01:41:30.639]  It is.
[01:41:31.019 --> 01:41:36.701]  It's a cultural Cold War, and it's really multifaceted, and it goes beyond YouTube.
[01:41:36.761 --> 01:41:42.663]  I don't know if you caught the news, but Reddit just recently did a purge of their own channels, or sub-forums.
[01:41:43.283 --> 01:41:45.444]  They made a big public announcement yesterday.
[01:41:46.924 --> 01:41:56.487]  And so they got rid of the sub-channels, GunDeals, GunsForSale, BrassSwap, GunItForward, and SecretSniper, all very popular discussion forums within Reddit.
[01:41:57.367 --> 01:41:58.049]  All wiped out.
[01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.950]  New policy.
[01:41:59.431 --> 01:42:00.634]  You can't talk about guns.
[01:42:00.654 --> 01:42:02.317]  You can't talk about the sale of firearms.
[01:42:02.377 --> 01:42:03.519]  And think about that!
[01:42:03.559 --> 01:42:06.705]  Think about saying you can't show guns, talk about guns.
[01:42:06.906 --> 01:42:08.769]  They're trying to kill Second Amendment free speech.
[01:42:10.029 --> 01:42:16.210]  They're trying to kill free speech, and they're trying to curtail a perfectly legal activity.
[01:42:16.511 --> 01:42:18.491]  It is not illegal for me, under U.S.
[01:42:18.571 --> 01:42:21.672]  law, for me to come to your house and sell you a rifle.
[01:42:21.792 --> 01:42:23.992]  I can gift you a rifle for a Christmas present.
[01:42:24.052 --> 01:42:25.373]  I do it in my own family.
[01:42:25.753 --> 01:42:32.034]  But what they're saying, these online media giants, are saying is, well, if you do that or talk about it, we're not going to allow that.
[01:42:32.534 --> 01:42:34.455]  So, even though it's legal under U.S.
[01:42:34.535 --> 01:42:37.396]  law, under their policies, they're going to say, well, you can't do that.
[01:42:37.496 --> 01:42:38.796]  We no longer accept that.
[01:42:39.882 --> 01:42:40.763]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:41.524 --> 01:42:42.024]  Stay right there.
[01:42:42.044 --> 01:42:43.865]  We're going to come back and talk about how we counter this.
[01:42:44.546 --> 01:42:45.947]  Because that's where this is going.
[01:42:46.567 --> 01:42:50.110]  Just like a Nazi Germany or any other authoritarian regime, they first cut off your commerce.
[01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:51.070]  But it's beyond that.
[01:42:51.251 --> 01:42:52.832]  They're just banning sites that show guns.
[01:42:55.874 --> 01:43:02.139]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:45:05.093 --> 01:45:07.774]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[01:45:07.854 --> 01:45:13.839]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[01:45:13.859 --> 01:45:16.180]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:24.546]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[01:45:24.626 --> 01:45:27.488]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[01:45:27.908 --> 01:45:37.571]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:40.912]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[01:45:41.012 --> 01:45:48.695]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:48.755 --> 01:45:49.775]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:45:49.855 --> 01:45:51.916]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[01:45:51.956 --> 01:45:52.936]  It was hilarious.
[01:45:55.077 --> 01:45:57.279]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[01:45:57.379 --> 01:46:07.226]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[01:46:07.246 --> 01:46:09.648]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[01:46:10.269 --> 01:46:16.693]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[01:46:17.294 --> 01:46:18.915]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[01:46:20.098 --> 01:46:26.386]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brain Force.
[01:46:26.446 --> 01:46:28.569]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[01:46:28.929 --> 01:46:30.091]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[01:46:30.171 --> 01:46:30.411]  Good.

[01:46:32.153 --> 01:46:36.879]  You're literally making Info Wars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[01:46:37.159 --> 01:46:39.242]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[01:46:39.622 --> 01:46:42.025]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[01:46:42.365 --> 01:46:45.268]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[01:46:45.308 --> 01:46:46.790]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:47.811]  BrainForce Plus.
[01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:50.954]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:58.462 --> 01:47:01.105]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.275 --> 01:47:17.558]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.218 --> 01:47:22.420]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.601]  I work from 9 to 5.
[01:47:25.001 --> 01:47:26.281]  Hell, I pay the price.
[01:47:26.741 --> 01:47:30.803]  Alright, we've got big breaking news from one of our sources inside Citibank.
[01:47:30.823 --> 01:47:31.784]  This is an exclusive.
[01:47:31.804 --> 01:47:34.905]  We'll have an article up in the next 30 minutes for InfoWars.com.
[01:47:36.775 --> 01:47:38.796]  This is from folks inside Citibank.
[01:47:39.596 --> 01:47:46.578]  You heard about a month ago, the left called for big banks to ban the NRA having credit cards.
[01:47:47.618 --> 01:47:57.301]  And the NRA being able to process credit cards, not for gun sales, but for baseball caps, NRA events, t-shirts, paraphernalia, you know, schwag.
[01:47:58.181 --> 01:48:00.542]  Basically, you know, NRA fan gear.
[01:48:04.281 --> 01:48:09.405]  They said, well, that's tortious interference, that's racketeering, that's discrimination, we can't do that.
[01:48:09.645 --> 01:48:12.627]  Well, they're putting Campbell's nose under the tent flap.
[01:48:12.888 --> 01:48:15.710]  For TV viewers, I'll show you a document cam shot of this.
[01:48:16.931 --> 01:48:29.861]  This is on the heels now of all that's going on with YouTube banning anybody they don't like showing guns and selectively enforcing it because that's what it does and that's how they'll get this through.
[01:48:30.341 --> 01:48:32.663]  This is from the head of Citibank.
[01:48:33.891 --> 01:48:45.705]  Mike Corbat to the employees and they say anybody that sells to someone under 21 even though it's legal, any gun shop, any company, anybody
[01:48:46.886 --> 01:48:49.929]  So that's what the Democrats want by fiat through the companies.
[01:48:50.489 --> 01:48:56.835]  Anybody that sells bump stocks and then it gets vague, you know, semi-auto, you name it, we will not let this company do business with us.
[01:48:56.876 --> 01:48:57.516]  We will block them.
[01:48:57.776 --> 01:48:58.978]  So this is to set the precedent.
[01:48:59.318 --> 01:49:04.523]  He says, you know, I know it's too extreme for some, not extreme enough for others here at the bottom, but we're trying to do our part.
[01:49:05.223 --> 01:49:11.409]  So they want to start the precedent here of putting us into these digital, digital
[01:49:12.654 --> 01:49:16.975]  Warrens, these digital ghettos, before they put us in the digital camps.
[01:49:17.376 --> 01:49:18.176]  And that's what it is.
[01:49:18.896 --> 01:49:27.019]  So, going back to the gentleman that we are interviewing, Tim Harmsman of the Military Arms Channel.
[01:49:27.479 --> 01:49:37.142]  I know what they're doing, banning our channels, bringing them back three times in one week, restricting them, taking yours down for a few weeks, bringing it back, banning thousands of others that never came back, like Natural News.
[01:49:37.782 --> 01:49:40.825]  They're just doing so much of it, people get sick of hearing about it.
[01:49:41.085 --> 01:49:43.788]  And they rally and get upset, and then it comes back.
[01:49:43.828 --> 01:49:45.549]  And then they take it away, and then it doesn't come back.
[01:49:45.829 --> 01:49:48.292]  And our live streaming is still blocked on YouTube on our main channels.
[01:49:49.454 --> 01:49:50.615]  Even though the strikes were taken down.
[01:49:50.655 --> 01:49:52.598]  So, it's just wearing us out.
[01:49:52.618 --> 01:49:53.819]  It's just getting us used to it.
[01:49:54.119 --> 01:50:00.607]  But if we stay aware and involved, if President Trump speaks out, if class action suits are filed for discrimination, I think we can back him off.
[01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:02.168]  But what do you make of the Citibank announcement?
[01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.411]  And then what else do you want to say about this?
[01:50:04.751 --> 01:50:08.856]  And what do you think people should do to counter this attack on the Second and the First Amendment?
[01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:12.511]  First of all, the Citibank thing comes as no surprise.
[01:50:12.571 --> 01:50:17.193]  I mean, that started in the Obama era, where he was urging banks just not do business with gun stores.
[01:50:17.253 --> 01:50:18.813]  I also happen to own a gun store.
[01:50:19.413 --> 01:50:23.535]  And it's very hard to get a bank to even accept our business, which is just asinine.
[01:50:23.555 --> 01:50:27.316]  We sell a constitutionally protected item, and they don't want to do business with us.
[01:50:27.897 --> 01:50:29.457]  And that was an Obama-era thing.
[01:50:29.997 --> 01:50:33.799]  Now, seeing banks like Citibank and stuff like that coming out with these policies, sadly,
[01:50:34.796 --> 01:50:38.419]  It's not surprising, but we have to fight back.
[01:50:38.459 --> 01:50:43.182]  One of the things that we're doing in the firearms community, four or five years ago I saw this coming.
[01:50:43.222 --> 01:50:44.103]  This isn't really new.
[01:50:44.203 --> 01:50:48.566]  They've been harassing us for years, striking our channels, doing all sorts of stuff.
[01:50:48.706 --> 01:50:51.648]  They've been probing, but this is a big assault.
[01:50:52.881 --> 01:50:53.181]  It is.
[01:50:53.301 --> 01:50:57.305]  And what we've done is we've gone out and we've built an alternative called Full30.com.
[01:50:57.385 --> 01:51:02.270]  And now if you go and look at that, you'll see all the channels that are threatened right now are posting over there.
[01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:11.419]  And that's what we've had to do to protect ourselves so when YouTube inevitably pulls our plug, which they will, they're just taking baby steps in that direction, we have some place to go.
[01:51:11.459 --> 01:51:14.342]  But the ultimate goal, Alex, as you know, is to silence us.
[01:51:14.722 --> 01:51:17.285]  Because these corporate giants like Facebook and YouTube
[01:51:18.065 --> 01:51:21.007]  They have a political agenda, and they'll tell you they don't.
[01:51:21.547 --> 01:51:23.729]  They say, oh, no, no, no, it's not a political agenda.
[01:51:23.749 --> 01:51:26.130]  We don't have a political agenda, and we both know that.
[01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:27.211]  But it's in all the WikiLeaks.
[01:51:27.231 --> 01:51:28.232]  They're total globalists.
[01:51:28.872 --> 01:51:29.252]  Exactly.
[01:51:29.493 --> 01:51:31.034]  I mean, look what YouTube did.
[01:51:31.074 --> 01:51:35.356]  They hired 10,000 moderators from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:51:35.657 --> 01:51:39.659]  Alex, you and I both know that's a radical far-left group that has a political agenda.
[01:51:39.819 --> 01:51:42.121]  It's a foreign intelligence agency.
[01:51:43.677 --> 01:51:45.738]  That may well be true, as well.
[01:51:45.938 --> 01:51:51.959]  But I do know that they're a far-left political activist group, and they've tasked them with moderating our channels.
[01:51:52.219 --> 01:51:56.920]  And that's why we're seeing account strike after account strike, and all we have to do is accumulate three of them.
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.060]  You know this as a YouTuber.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.661]  Three account strikes and we're out.
[01:51:59.741 --> 01:52:00.541]  Our channel's gone.
[01:52:00.901 --> 01:52:09.703]  And with 10,000 Southern Poverty Law Center moderators sitting out there, going through our content and interpreting these vague policies themselves with no direction,
[01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:15.545]  We're going to get account strikes very quickly, and a lot of channels are just simply going to get deleted through that process.
[01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:18.487]  And YouTube's going to say, well, it wasn't really our fault.
[01:52:18.587 --> 01:52:19.847]  Our moderators made a mistake.
[01:52:20.128 --> 01:52:20.968]  They misinterpreted.
[01:52:21.228 --> 01:52:22.048]  Sorry, everybody.
[01:52:22.509 --> 01:52:28.952]  But the endgame is that you and I both know, Alex, whoever controls the media controls the minds of the people.
[01:52:29.372 --> 01:52:33.354]  And so when Facebook and YouTube, which are the new newspapers from the 1700s,
[01:52:35.012 --> 01:52:40.935]  These new social giants, when they can control our message and they can shut us up, they can now influence elections.
[01:52:41.435 --> 01:52:46.378]  And they can push their political agenda simply by squashing us in search results or silencing us.
[01:52:47.299 --> 01:52:49.480]  By claiming we violated some nonsensical policy.
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:53:00.902]  It's all one big plan, I believe, to ultimately control the new digital media, the internet, and make sure that their socialist empire is secure because they control the airwaves.
[01:53:01.443 --> 01:53:10.465]  That's right, and top historians and others have come out and said, if we don't do something about trust-busting and making these companies stop through Congress and other areas, they're already censoring in Europe.
[01:53:10.825 --> 01:53:15.688]  Top historians have said Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[01:53:16.008 --> 01:53:17.309]  This is the new town hall.
[01:53:17.609 --> 01:53:18.970]  This is the new digital square.
[01:53:19.491 --> 01:53:29.197]  And they advertise themselves as utilities, and they're saying gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, white people, you name it, don't have access to that lunch counter.
[01:53:30.529 --> 01:53:30.709]  Right.
[01:53:30.969 --> 01:53:31.970]  They want to silence us.
[01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.990]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:53:33.511 --> 01:53:37.033]  And I do think it is because they do want to influence elections in the future.
[01:53:37.633 --> 01:53:39.074]  And it's not going to stop.
[01:53:39.134 --> 01:53:40.255]  It's not going to go away.
[01:53:40.715 --> 01:53:46.919]  And here's the problem is YouTube and Facebook are monopolies in every sense of the definition.
[01:53:47.219 --> 01:53:47.879]  They truly are.
[01:53:48.239 --> 01:53:54.723]  Because if YouTube kicks you off, you have, aside from like what we've built on poll 30, most people don't have a fallback plan.
[01:53:54.983 --> 01:53:57.425]  When YouTube kicks you off and if that's how you make a living,
[01:53:58.602 --> 01:53:59.163]  You're done.
[01:53:59.663 --> 01:54:01.004]  They've effectively silenced you.
[01:54:01.024 --> 01:54:02.245]  It's a digital ghetto.
[01:54:02.305 --> 01:54:10.151]  And as Matt Drudge said here in the studio two years ago, two and a half years ago now on Tom Flies, an exclusive interview, he was told by Supreme Court Justice that they were told it's coming next year.
[01:54:10.531 --> 01:54:13.433]  But we derailed it for a while, so we're fighting back.
[01:54:13.493 --> 01:54:14.614]  They didn't get their full plan.
[01:54:14.874 --> 01:54:22.299]  So everybody has to create their own website, their own platform, even if it's very simple, but then reach into the bigger platforms to draw people into it.
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:29.585]  Because that's a fallback, but they admit they're coming after our subsites next, just like they're trying to kick us off our bank accounts.
[01:54:30.765 --> 01:54:31.846]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[01:54:32.106 --> 01:54:33.367]  I mean, it's a non-ending war.
[01:54:33.808 --> 01:54:37.670]  And every time they move and we make a counter move, they move against us again.
[01:54:38.031 --> 01:54:39.532]  It's not going to simply go away.
[01:54:39.652 --> 01:54:40.933]  And it's a cultural war.
[01:54:41.313 --> 01:54:44.755]  It's one that's being fought in the digital space, and it's one that's being fought in the schools.
[01:54:44.795 --> 01:54:52.761]  We have the schools programming our children, and now we have these large corporate giants like YouTube and Facebook programming the rest of us simply because they're controlling the flow of information.
[01:54:53.021 --> 01:54:55.043]  The left claims they're the little ragtag guys.
[01:54:55.083 --> 01:54:56.044]  No, they're the Death Star.
[01:54:56.304 --> 01:54:57.045]  We're the X-Wings.
[01:54:57.405 --> 01:55:03.110]  They're the ones worldwide taking people's freedom with slave camps, slave labor in China, Apple owns.
[01:55:03.130 --> 01:55:04.191]  These are horrible people.
[01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:07.854]  So America has to represent the truth here, get it out.
[01:55:08.054 --> 01:55:09.796]  But what does Trump and Congress need to do?
[01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:14.640]  I mean, it's time, just like he took action against China today, it's time to take action against these tech giants.
[01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:22.619]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not an attorney, but in my opinion, like I said, I truly believe that YouTube and Facebook are monopolies.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.641]  They simply have no viable competitor.
[01:55:24.661 --> 01:55:31.405]  They advertised themselves under federal law, brother, that Obama signed that they are utilities and that they are monopolies.
[01:55:31.445 --> 01:55:32.146]  You are correct.
[01:55:33.146 --> 01:55:33.286]  Yep.
[01:55:33.587 --> 01:55:36.348]  I mean, if they're admitting it, then why isn't it being deregulated?
[01:55:36.528 --> 01:55:41.612]  I'm sorry, why aren't they regulating and breaking them up like they did AT&T 30 years ago, right?
[01:55:42.642 --> 01:55:44.883]  Because, I don't know, I wish I knew the answer.
[01:55:45.223 --> 01:55:49.083]  But they most certainly are monopolies, and they most certainly are public utilities, in my opinion.
[01:55:49.343 --> 01:55:50.804]  And you're right, and they've said that.
[01:55:50.864 --> 01:55:53.224]  But imagine if you were on the old Bell Telecom.
[01:55:53.244 --> 01:55:56.585]  They just had a monopoly of, you know, control and charge too much.
[01:55:56.985 --> 01:55:57.625]  Then that was bad enough.
[01:55:57.645 --> 01:56:03.226]  This is a monopoly where you're on the phone, they don't like what you say, the Internet's the same thing as a phone, and they cut in and block you.
[01:56:03.506 --> 01:56:04.626]  Or they cut in and change it.
[01:56:04.646 --> 01:56:07.607]  I mean, and they're monitoring what you say in live time.
[01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:11.051]  To that point, Alex, this really happened.
[01:56:11.091 --> 01:56:17.296]  Hank Strange, another gun channel, was having a livestream broadcast where he was talking about the politics of firearms.
[01:56:17.716 --> 01:56:21.038]  And midstream, midstream, they cut him off.
[01:56:21.078 --> 01:56:25.282]  YouTube cut him off, struck his account, and silenced him right in the middle of the stream.
[01:56:25.322 --> 01:56:28.084]  Sir, I know that they give us warnings and so does Facebook.
[01:56:28.604 --> 01:56:32.546]  We saw your live stream during the... We cut it because you used the wrong T-word.
[01:56:32.586 --> 01:56:33.166]  I'm not kidding.
[01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.047]  Mostly transsexual, not the other one.
[01:56:35.627 --> 01:56:38.648]  It's a live-time algorithm listening to everything you say.
[01:56:39.148 --> 01:56:42.770]  It's a computer, AI, already censoring the American people.
[01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:44.751]  Yep, that.
[01:56:44.951 --> 01:56:50.533]  We have the AI doing it, and we have 10,000 Southern Poverty Law Center moderators pushing a political agenda.
[01:56:50.653 --> 01:56:52.754]  I was going to say, well, they program the algorithm.
[01:56:54.369 --> 01:56:59.954]  Yeah, they most certainly do, and their AI is intelligent, and so it's learning, and they always boast about that.
[01:57:00.074 --> 01:57:01.355]  Oh, well, our AI is learning.
[01:57:01.375 --> 01:57:02.036]  Give it some time.
[01:57:02.276 --> 01:57:05.279]  Well, every time they give it time to learn, it further restricts us.
[01:57:05.899 --> 01:57:07.101]  We get more count strikes.
[01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:08.942]  So the AI is certainly learning.
[01:57:09.243 --> 01:57:11.625]  It's learning to discriminate against our content.
[01:57:12.168 --> 01:57:12.388]  Wow.
[01:57:12.628 --> 01:57:14.109]  I mean, absolutely.
[01:57:14.169 --> 01:57:18.351]  And remember, two months ago, they were talking about Paul Watson of Infowars at the top story on Twitter.
[01:57:18.371 --> 01:57:21.572]  They're talking to the executives of Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
[01:57:22.092 --> 01:57:23.133]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:23.453 --> 01:57:26.734]  And they're sitting there, and they go, Infowars at the top story at lunch.
[01:57:26.754 --> 01:57:27.574]  Well, we took it down, sir.
[01:57:27.594 --> 01:57:27.955]  Don't worry.
[01:57:28.255 --> 01:57:29.255]  They go, yeah, it's fake news.
[01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:31.096]  They claim a Muslim ran people over in New York.
[01:57:31.636 --> 01:57:32.357]  And it was all true.
[01:57:32.718 --> 01:57:34.320]  They were mod- and he said, sir, don't worry.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.004]  The next few months, our algorithm AI is ready.
[01:57:37.264 --> 01:57:37.965]  We'll stop them.
[01:57:38.306 --> 01:57:40.489]  Where a few months later, here it is.
[01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:43.052]  We'll be back with the military arms channel head.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.482]  Tell us about Spikes Tactical and why it's so important.
[01:57:48.502 --> 01:57:48.803]  5% off.
[01:57:48.823 --> 01:57:50.344]  It's already discounted, folks.
[01:57:51.024 --> 01:57:54.586]  When you go there, use promo code Alex at SpikesTactical.com.
[01:57:54.827 --> 01:57:55.847]  Tell us about that, Kit.
[01:57:56.047 --> 01:58:03.432]  Spike himself just sought to make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford.
[01:58:04.273 --> 01:58:08.996]  And that's why Pipe Hitters Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well.
[01:58:09.296 --> 01:58:11.077]  We wanted to put out a line of rifles.
[01:58:11.578 --> 01:58:14.560]  We wanted rifles that were high quality,
[01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:19.341]  That were combat rated that we could like put our name on and really stand behind.
[01:58:19.461 --> 01:58:24.962]  So we looked around at quite a few companies and to be quite honest, it was an easy decision to make.
[01:58:25.322 --> 01:58:28.783]  Spikes Tactical is a small family owned business.
[01:58:29.163 --> 01:58:30.423]  They stand behind their products.
[01:58:30.663 --> 01:58:33.244]  As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee.
[01:58:33.264 --> 01:58:36.725]  If you have a problem with your gun, they will fix the problem.
[01:58:36.785 --> 01:58:39.065]  And that is huge in today's age.
[01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:43.246]  So you've got a very high end rifle at a very affordable price.
[01:58:43.826 --> 01:58:47.307]  We're also 100% American-made.
[01:58:47.507 --> 01:58:50.048]  They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:52.449]  They are strong supporters of the military.
[01:58:52.549 --> 01:58:53.750]  Spike gives back a lot.
[01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:57.912]  Well, I know the listeners are big fans already of Spike Tactical and the fact you're supporting us.

[01:59:49.147 --> 01:59:52.850]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:11.437]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:12.179 --> 02:00:13.641]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:13.902 --> 02:00:15.044]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:15.585 --> 02:00:20.273]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:32.274]  Alright, sometimes people all over the internet get mad at me for interrupting a lot.
[02:00:32.315 --> 02:00:34.657]  It's just a guy saying, I don't know this, I don't know that, and I'm jumping in on him.
[02:00:34.918 --> 02:00:37.380]  The viewers all love Tim Harmson.
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.121]  I like his channel.
[02:00:38.141 --> 02:00:38.882]  I've seen it as well.
[02:00:38.902 --> 02:00:40.083]  A lot of my crew like him.
[02:00:40.764 --> 02:00:43.467]  But the reason I've been successful is, I'm not polished.
[02:00:43.728 --> 02:00:44.288]  I'm pissed off.
[02:00:44.989 --> 02:00:49.313]  And I'm frothing at the mouth here, because this is an attack on the First Amendment, the Second Amendment.
[02:00:49.333 --> 02:00:52.476]  I want to invite Tim back later in the week, you know, to do a longer interview with us.
[02:00:52.516 --> 02:00:54.198]  He's a really smart guy about all this.
[02:00:54.218 --> 02:01:03.567]  We've got the folks from Spice Tactical joining us, who've just been banned off YouTube, and they admit they banned them, saying they egregiously violated showing how to use firearms, like that's a bad thing.
[02:01:03.967 --> 02:01:05.308]  And I've got all the transcripts of it.
[02:01:05.729 --> 02:01:08.712]  But Tim, in the four or five minutes left, let me just give you the floor instead of me ranting.
[02:01:09.332 --> 02:01:12.094]  All I'm saying is, we've got to get angry.
[02:01:12.475 --> 02:01:13.495]  We've got to get focused.
[02:01:13.535 --> 02:01:14.296]  This is real.
[02:01:14.776 --> 02:01:15.677]  This is happening.
[02:01:15.997 --> 02:01:16.938]  This is un-American.
[02:01:16.998 --> 02:01:20.541]  It's the EU admittedly pressuring YouTube and others to censor us.
[02:01:20.841 --> 02:01:22.082]  We were showing articles of that.
[02:01:22.503 --> 02:01:29.448]  Foreign, unelected government run by the Nazi heir, Juncker, wants us shut up and says he's going to stop Trump.
[02:01:29.748 --> 02:01:31.290]  And the Communist Chinese are involved.
[02:01:31.490 --> 02:01:32.631]  They've bought off our media.
[02:01:33.191 --> 02:01:34.152]  I'm not just saying this.
[02:01:34.472 --> 02:01:35.793]  This is the war we're in.
[02:01:36.073 --> 02:01:37.455]  This is the real fight for the country.
[02:01:37.475 --> 02:01:37.755]  Go ahead.
[02:01:40.956 --> 02:01:44.558]  I absolutely agree, Alex, and I think one of our biggest enemies right now in all of this is apathy.
[02:01:44.998 --> 02:01:51.961]  A lot of gun owners falsely believe that the Republicans are going to save them if they just sit back and trust the Republican representatives are going to save them.
[02:01:52.361 --> 02:01:53.041]  They are not.
[02:01:53.161 --> 02:01:57.343]  Many of these anti-gun bills, like Carbello's bill out of Florida, was authored.
[02:01:57.403 --> 02:02:00.404]  It was a bump stock ban bill, which is a false narrative, by the way.
[02:02:00.684 --> 02:02:02.465]  It's far more sweeping than just a bump stock.
[02:02:02.905 --> 02:02:04.185]  That's right, and if you look at
[02:02:31.983 --> 02:02:32.763]  Everything they're doing.
[02:02:32.783 --> 02:02:34.104]  I mean they're going after it all.
[02:02:34.204 --> 02:02:35.365]  They know we've woken up.
[02:02:35.865 --> 02:02:36.966]  The globalists are scared.
[02:02:37.006 --> 02:02:38.606]  This is their big move.
[02:02:38.987 --> 02:02:40.147]  Everybody needs to understand that.
[02:02:41.708 --> 02:02:42.048]  I agree.
[02:02:42.428 --> 02:02:46.571]  And people definitely need to get up and start making their voices heard.
[02:02:46.591 --> 02:02:49.012]  You have Bloomberg who is outspending...
[02:02:53.476 --> 02:02:56.418]  For an entire budget, for an entire year, for all 50 states.
[02:02:56.719 --> 02:03:07.327]  In my little town of Valparaiso, Indiana, on Saturday, we have a March for Your Lives protest that's going on that I'm helping to work with a counter-protest group that's going to support the Second Amendment.
[02:03:07.927 --> 02:03:17.615]  But good grief, I mean, they're now focusing less on federal legislation, and these anti-gunners are getting very successful and being very successful at the state level and at the city level.
[02:03:17.635 --> 02:03:18.996]  Well, that's the Bloomberg plan.
[02:03:19.336 --> 02:03:20.177]  That's the Bloomberg plan.
[02:03:20.197 --> 02:03:20.437]  It is.
[02:03:21.354 --> 02:03:21.654]  It is.
[02:03:22.035 --> 02:03:23.236]  And they've shifted gears.
[02:03:23.316 --> 02:03:24.417]  Their tactics have shifted.
[02:03:24.577 --> 02:03:26.058]  And our response hasn't shifted.
[02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:32.363]  But look, Florida fell to an anti-gun bill that just a year ago most people would think would never pass in Florida.
[02:03:32.604 --> 02:03:40.911]  But they just passed a bump stock ban, which they just recently announced that, oh my gosh, they may have inadvertently banned far more than bump stocks.
[02:03:41.231 --> 02:03:42.312]  It wasn't inadvertent.
[02:03:42.412 --> 02:03:43.673]  It was totally by design.
[02:03:43.973 --> 02:03:45.815]  And it just happened in the gun-shine state.
[02:03:46.075 --> 02:03:48.517]  And if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere else.
[02:03:48.597 --> 02:03:49.438]  And let me add this.
[02:03:49.838 --> 02:03:50.638]  Trump means well.
[02:03:50.798 --> 02:03:51.978]  Overall, he's doing a great job.
[02:03:52.018 --> 02:03:53.219]  They slipped stuff in front of him.
[02:03:53.719 --> 02:03:55.159]  He thought it was on the teacher bill.
[02:03:55.639 --> 02:03:58.500]  We need to put pressure on him on the gun deal or he could go sideways.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.320]  Absolutely.
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:06.361]  We need to make all of our representatives know exactly where we stand, including the President of the United States.
[02:04:06.761 --> 02:04:13.222]  And I agree, he probably means well, but he needs to be educated because I'll guarantee you the Second Amendment isn't his top priority.
[02:04:13.583 --> 02:04:14.323]  Donald Jr.
[02:04:14.343 --> 02:04:14.843]  is a big shooter.
[02:04:14.863 --> 02:04:15.903]  I see him at all the events.
[02:04:16.463 --> 02:04:19.985]  But, you know, his father, not so much, and so we need to help guide him.
[02:04:20.105 --> 02:04:27.169]  And we need to tell these Republicans, they better do their job, so they're going to get to see a mass, you know, purge, just like in 94, when they let the assault weapons... Well, that's right.
[02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:28.249]  ...happen under President Clinton.
[02:04:28.309 --> 02:04:29.410]  Well, here's the takeaway.
[02:04:29.590 --> 02:04:30.851]  We got a beachhead with Trump.
[02:04:31.091 --> 02:04:32.571]  That got the enemy to counter-strike.
[02:04:32.892 --> 02:04:34.572]  This is the second American Revolution.
[02:04:34.592 --> 02:04:35.273]  The leftists know it.
[02:04:35.553 --> 02:04:36.233]  They're saying that.
[02:04:36.253 --> 02:04:37.134]  They're coming after us.
[02:04:37.714 --> 02:04:39.715]  Tim Harmsen, Military Arms Channel.
[02:04:40.035 --> 02:04:41.836]  People should visit it on YouTube, while it's still there.
[02:04:41.876 --> 02:04:43.197]  YouTube.com, Military Arms Channel.
[02:04:43.437 --> 02:04:45.138]  And again, what's the website for folks that want to visit it?
[02:04:46.548 --> 02:04:50.711]  It's full30.com, full30.com or Military Arms Channel on YouTube.
[02:04:50.851 --> 02:04:52.852]  Alright folks, this is the battle for the Republic.
[02:04:52.872 --> 02:04:53.392]  This is it.
[02:04:53.732 --> 02:04:54.273]  Not a drill.
[02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:58.152]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:04:58.332 --> 02:05:00.732]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[02:05:00.912 --> 02:05:08.214]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:05:08.414 --> 02:05:18.717]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:05:19.057 --> 02:05:26.602]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:05:26.902 --> 02:05:36.848]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:39.030]  And this part is most important.
[02:05:39.150 --> 02:05:45.614]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:05:45.954 --> 02:05:47.015]  That means it's clean.
[02:05:47.395 --> 02:05:48.416]  That means it's pure.
[02:05:48.516 --> 02:05:51.338]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:05:51.418 --> 02:05:54.180]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.881]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:06:04.767 --> 02:06:08.529]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.522 --> 02:06:24.443]  We are back live.
[02:06:24.704 --> 02:06:30.611]  And I got a nasty reputation with globalists, communists, fascists, islamicists, tyrants, bullies, you name it.
[02:06:30.651 --> 02:06:31.792]  I love having that reputation.
[02:06:32.333 --> 02:06:34.155]  And I'm so honored to be here with you right now.
[02:06:35.845 --> 02:06:45.975]  President Trump's done amazing things with standing up against the deindustrialization, China's $400-plus billion-dollar-a-year trade deficit, and now $60 billion in sanctions for intellectual property theft.
[02:06:46.295 --> 02:06:48.477]  A lot of big breaking news on Infowars.com.
[02:06:49.038 --> 02:06:52.020]  We have investigative journalist Laura Loomer joining us.
[02:06:52.401 --> 02:07:00.328]  At the bottom of the hour, they got the footage and the audio of the Broward County teachers meeting with select students, planning to basically storm the White House.
[02:07:01.493 --> 02:07:03.596]  If you want to have a pro-gun rally, they kick you out of school.
[02:07:04.317 --> 02:07:05.638]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:07:05.678 --> 02:07:09.744]  But the fight for the First Amendment, the fight for the Second Amendment's here.
[02:07:10.785 --> 02:07:16.112]  And YouTube and Google frame this like, oh, we're just saying if you're selling guns, you can't sell them online.
[02:07:16.132 --> 02:07:18.335]  They're not selling guns directly to people on YouTube.
[02:07:20.345 --> 02:07:33.915]  They're saying, just like the big banks called for and the Democrats called for a month ago, they said we want to ban people transferring guns, we want to ban gun shops, anybody that even sells guns like sporting goods, and Cabela's and Dick's from being able to use credit cards.
[02:07:33.975 --> 02:07:36.017]  So Dick's went, okay, we'll stop selling semi-auto.
[02:07:37.671 --> 02:07:38.692]  And now we have the breaking news.
[02:07:38.712 --> 02:07:42.715]  We're scanning it in, putting it on InfoWars.com, sent to us by a Citibank executive.
[02:07:42.976 --> 02:07:43.536]  We've checked it.
[02:07:44.257 --> 02:07:51.103]  They're saying, you sell semi-auto, you sell bump stocks, you sell under 21, you sell BB guns, we're banning you.
[02:07:52.024 --> 02:07:53.985]  So, there's the Citibank situation.
[02:07:54.005 --> 02:07:58.669]  They're coming for everybody right now, and they think we won't notice.
[02:07:59.390 --> 02:08:01.932]  This is a ban on our free speech, not just the Second Amendment.
[02:08:03.073 --> 02:08:03.554]  Just like
[02:08:04.898 --> 02:08:06.639]  Twitch has billions of views a week.
[02:08:06.759 --> 02:08:07.780]  It's the new ESPN.
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:13.883]  They're signing top video game players, like Ready Player One, like it's real, to huge contracts.
[02:08:14.924 --> 02:08:16.945]  This is the big new push that Amazon's doing.
[02:08:18.486 --> 02:08:23.189]  Well, we need to point out, OK, well, you don't bake the gay couple's cake, $500,000 ruling.
[02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:29.012]  What happens when you won't let the conservative show guns on the Internet legally, but everybody else can?
[02:08:29.973 --> 02:08:33.495]  Ah, you see, we've got to frame the debate the way it is.
[02:08:34.437 --> 02:08:36.759]  Kit Copes, a great guy, been here in studio a few times.
[02:08:37.339 --> 02:08:47.688]  He's a four-time Muay Thai world champion, MMA title contender, current position director of marketing Spike's Tactical, firearms manufacturer in Florida, founded in September 10, 2001.
[02:08:47.748 --> 02:08:52.972]  He's formerly hosted the Wild World of Spike on Spike TV.
[02:08:54.227 --> 02:08:57.409]  And Kit has also worked as a private security contractor, and I won't get into all that.
[02:08:57.690 --> 02:08:59.151]  SpotsTactical.com.
[02:08:59.511 --> 02:09:03.114]  So Kit, thousands of sites banned a month ago.
[02:09:03.134 --> 02:09:04.174]  A few came back.
[02:09:05.495 --> 02:09:08.658]  Then you guys just got completely banned and were as the poster child.
[02:09:09.378 --> 02:09:13.720]  I think being punished for being Patriot, standing up to Antifa, and being sponsors of Infowars.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:18.162]  As you know, folks get 5% off with promo code ALEX, getting the ultimate AR-15 accessory.
[02:09:18.202 --> 02:09:24.225]  So, this is true prior restraint, true Soviet-level censorship, and I think America should really get upset.
[02:09:26.070 --> 02:09:26.671]  Absolutely.
[02:09:27.452 --> 02:09:31.057]  And not only, I mean, obviously we're all upset.
[02:09:31.598 --> 02:09:41.173]  We need to actually do something, something in the class action realm or something like that, because these companies, though they really are public utilities,
[02:09:41.846 --> 02:09:53.991]  They're still trying to, you know, espouse the terms of a private company and we can make up our own rules because we're a private company, not a government entity and that kind of thing.
[02:09:54.712 --> 02:09:57.173]  So we got banned on Tuesday.
[02:09:58.633 --> 02:10:01.815]  We have maybe 20 videos.
[02:10:01.855 --> 02:10:03.775]  We just started our YouTube channel.
[02:10:04.176 --> 02:10:07.337]  So we started ramping up the, you know, using that platform.
[02:10:08.248 --> 02:10:23.713]  We got an email telling us that we have had several transgressions against YouTube's terms of service, and then about two minutes later, we got an email saying that we were banned from YouTube.
[02:10:24.734 --> 02:10:26.354]  So that was our warning.
[02:10:26.594 --> 02:10:28.595]  No three strikes, nothing like that.
[02:10:28.835 --> 02:10:32.397]  We got an email, and then two minutes later, oh, by the way, you're banned.
[02:10:34.364 --> 02:10:39.065]  So we kind of we just put that information out there to everybody.
[02:10:39.905 --> 02:10:54.609]  And now, mind you, the video that we had on there that they decided was was too aggressive or whatever it was, the decision was, was how to install a trigger guard.
[02:10:56.508 --> 02:10:58.331]  That's two dudes standing behind a table.
[02:10:58.752 --> 02:11:01.416]  You put this this screw here, you put that screw there.
[02:11:01.837 --> 02:11:02.758]  It's a trigger guard.
[02:11:03.139 --> 02:11:03.619]  That's it.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:08.668]  So it's not like there's really anything that they could have grabbed on to.
[02:11:10.402 --> 02:11:11.944]  It's just that we're a gun manufacturer.
[02:11:12.304 --> 02:11:12.725]  That's all.
[02:11:13.025 --> 02:11:13.966]  Well, let's be clear though.
[02:11:14.427 --> 02:11:16.249]  Hollywood can show the misuse of guns.
[02:11:16.289 --> 02:11:18.391]  These anti-gun people can make fortunes off of it.
[02:11:18.671 --> 02:11:19.312]  That's all fine.
[02:11:19.332 --> 02:11:23.577]  YouTube can take money, you know, for all these new movies that shoot them up.
[02:11:23.597 --> 02:11:27.221]  It's like the remake of Death Wish, which I'm not against the movie Death Wish.
[02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:28.182]  I'm not for censoring it.
[02:11:28.462 --> 02:11:30.224]  I'm saying you can't censor us.
[02:11:30.264 --> 02:11:31.185]  You can't censor you.
[02:11:32.375 --> 02:11:37.636]  And then the video games and the violence and all the other guns and the military videos.
[02:11:37.696 --> 02:11:38.757]  It's totally selective.
[02:11:39.077 --> 02:11:40.137]  It's totally discriminatory.
[02:11:40.457 --> 02:11:48.699]  Under common law, everything, if they thought a half million dollar deal for not baking the gay couple's cake was big, which I say bake their cake, that's a private company though.
[02:11:48.719 --> 02:11:56.241]  But if it's train stations, even if it's private, or ubiquitous systems, you can't say people are banned from commerce.
[02:11:56.281 --> 02:11:57.562]  I mean, that's what Nazi Germany did.
[02:11:57.602 --> 02:11:58.622]  This is so serious.
[02:11:59.781 --> 02:12:00.942]  Oh, it's even worse than that.
[02:12:01.162 --> 02:12:08.465]  If you go onto YouTube right now, you can find videos on how to cook crystal methamphetamine the easy way.
[02:12:08.705 --> 02:12:10.186]  Or kids eating Tide Pods.
[02:12:10.626 --> 02:12:12.287]  Or kids eating Tide Pods.
[02:12:12.367 --> 02:12:15.468]  Or pedophile videos teaching you how to pick kids up.
[02:12:15.509 --> 02:12:15.949]  Exactly.
[02:12:16.649 --> 02:12:17.670]  Homeless fights.
[02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:18.770]  Felony fights.
[02:12:19.210 --> 02:12:22.672]  All kinds of illegal activities on YouTube right now.
[02:12:22.692 --> 02:12:28.635]  Well, remember, what was the name of that whole thing late last year where YouTube allowed billions of views of pedophile videos?
[02:12:29.215 --> 02:12:31.978]  But where they promoted pedophilia?
[02:12:32.098 --> 02:12:38.305]  That's on there, but a constitutionally mandated right, they're censoring.
[02:12:39.226 --> 02:12:39.947]  There you go, look at that.
[02:12:40.107 --> 02:12:41.469]  How to make crystal meth at home.
[02:12:42.659 --> 02:12:43.699]  What do you think of juries?
[02:12:43.719 --> 02:12:44.740]  Because I've talked to the lawyers.
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:45.660]  We've got it all lined up.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.321]  We get hit so much, we're picking the suits.
[02:12:47.761 --> 02:12:49.182]  They say this is all open and shut for us.
[02:12:49.222 --> 02:12:51.302]  The racketeering, the tortious interference.
[02:12:51.322 --> 02:12:58.665]  We have the Google and YouTube executives saying our main target's Alex Jones and then anything with American flags or pro-military or pro-Bill of Rights.
[02:12:58.905 --> 02:13:00.666]  I mean, real Americans are the enemy.
[02:13:00.906 --> 02:13:08.729]  And I'm proud to be in that group, but my God, we have them on four different videos saying we're not being targeted for violating the rules.
[02:13:08.989 --> 02:13:10.750]  We're being targeted because we're pro-America.
[02:13:12.077 --> 02:13:17.760]  It's almost as though we're not actually the citizens of America.
[02:13:18.281 --> 02:13:24.044]  We're the citizens of an older country that they're trying to move away from.
[02:13:25.345 --> 02:13:25.785]  Exactly.
[02:13:25.845 --> 02:13:28.126]  It's like they've rewritten the country, but we're still there.
[02:13:28.147 --> 02:13:29.968]  And they're like, no, we're overriding.
[02:13:30.028 --> 02:13:30.428]  Bye bye.
[02:13:30.468 --> 02:13:30.948]  You're gone.
[02:13:32.409 --> 02:13:33.550]  Yeah, we've changed our minds.
[02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:35.611]  We've changed our mind on all this freedom stuff.
[02:13:38.379 --> 02:13:39.860]  Kit, where do you see this going?
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:41.461]  We talked just a month ago when you were in studio.
[02:13:41.481 --> 02:13:43.603]  We knew this was coming, but I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:13:44.844 --> 02:13:46.085]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:13:46.886 --> 02:13:49.388]  The problem is that there's a monopoly.
[02:13:49.868 --> 02:13:51.249]  There's an absolute monopoly.
[02:13:51.329 --> 02:13:54.071]  YouTube is the second largest search engine on the Internet.
[02:13:54.452 --> 02:13:56.673]  It's the largest video forum on the Internet.
[02:13:57.714 --> 02:14:01.097]  Really, it should be a public utility.
[02:14:02.249 --> 02:14:03.610]  But they hold all the cards.
[02:14:03.670 --> 02:14:04.771]  They make all the rules.
[02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:16.919]  Their newest bundle of rules that they're coming out with in April is pretty much going to get rid of anything related to guns whatsoever.
[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.161]  And their test case was Spikes Tactical.
[02:14:19.181 --> 02:14:20.302]  Why do you think you were chosen?
[02:14:20.322 --> 02:14:22.863]  I want to make this point real quick before I forget.
[02:14:22.883 --> 02:14:23.304]  But go ahead.
[02:14:24.224 --> 02:14:30.869]  Yeah, I absolutely think that we've had a target on our back since we stood up against Antifa.
[02:14:32.116 --> 02:14:46.612]  And as that's their little street enforcers that have had their, that's why they're suing me as we expose anti-fund in Charlottesville, then they lied about us and they're, Georgetown's suing us because they wanted that to be the big youth movement and have them like Mao come out and this, I totally agree, that's why they're going after you.
[02:14:46.892 --> 02:14:48.193]  Well I know this, I've talked to people.
[02:14:48.974 --> 02:14:51.615]  The Defense Department and Congress in connection with the White House.
[02:14:52.135 --> 02:15:00.258]  And they keep explaining the geospatial, the CIA gave Google the keys to the Internet, the keys to the technology.
[02:15:00.619 --> 02:15:02.239]  It is supposed to be a utility for America.
[02:15:02.259 --> 02:15:03.420]  It's supposed to project U.S.
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:04.800]  values worldwide.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:05.941]  It's been hijacked by leftists.
[02:15:05.961 --> 02:15:08.061]  That's why Schmidt's out and all this is happening.
[02:15:08.422 --> 02:15:09.702]  But there's a war inside of it.
[02:15:09.762 --> 02:15:13.944]  So, absolutely, Google is really a government agency.
[02:15:14.404 --> 02:15:16.885]  And that's classified, but that's about to come out, by the way.
[02:15:17.245 --> 02:15:18.666]  And so they're not allowed to be doing this.
[02:15:18.686 --> 02:15:20.007]  I mean, they are beyond a utility.
[02:15:22.068 --> 02:15:22.628]  Absolutely.
[02:15:22.688 --> 02:15:33.355]  And again, they're abusing that power, that monopoly power that they've got to get rid of anybody that espouses ideals that they don't.
[02:15:34.224 --> 02:15:35.364]  I want to be clear.
[02:15:35.584 --> 02:15:36.405]  People can even look this up.
[02:15:36.425 --> 02:15:37.105]  A lot of it's public.
[02:15:37.405 --> 02:15:42.707]  They were given monopoly power to not be evil and to guard it and to promote and to fight China.
[02:15:43.267 --> 02:15:46.468]  They have been sold out like Apple and there's good people inside.
[02:15:46.508 --> 02:15:47.789]  There's a big fight inside.
[02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:52.830]  And they let 10,000 Southern Poverty Law Center globalists board YouTube.
[02:15:52.890 --> 02:15:53.771]  That's why this is happening.
[02:15:53.811 --> 02:15:54.311]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:58.083 --> 02:15:59.464]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:15:59.524 --> 02:16:00.964]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:16:01.024 --> 02:16:01.384]  Go ahead.
[02:16:01.484 --> 02:16:01.784]  Yes.
[02:16:02.205 --> 02:16:02.925]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:03.045 --> 02:16:09.227]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:16:09.447 --> 02:16:13.429]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:15.109]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:16:15.469 --> 02:16:22.172]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:16:22.252 --> 02:16:25.313]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:16:25.393 --> 02:16:28.814]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:16:29.115 --> 02:16:30.695]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:16:30.735 --> 02:16:32.976]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation.
[02:16:32.996 --> 02:16:38.058]  Because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[02:16:38.098 --> 02:16:38.559]  So, thank you.
[02:16:38.579 --> 02:16:44.401]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:16:44.541 --> 02:16:49.844]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:16:49.864 --> 02:16:52.925]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[02:16:54.775 --> 02:17:02.438]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:17:03.318 --> 02:17:07.379]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:10.220]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:17:11.021 --> 02:17:14.142]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:17:15.649 --> 02:17:27.795]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:17:28.476 --> 02:17:43.564]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:17:44.544 --> 02:17:48.248]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[02:17:48.829 --> 02:17:50.511]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:17:50.551 --> 02:17:53.374]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:17:54.735 --> 02:17:57.157]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:17:57.538 --> 02:17:59.380]  It's MycoZX Plus.
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:02.603]  Lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up.
[02:18:02.923 --> 02:18:05.226]  Signed a year contract with even bigger organic.
[02:18:05.706 --> 02:18:07.628]  Manufacturer and producer.
[02:18:07.988 --> 02:18:08.588]  Scalability.
[02:18:08.769 --> 02:18:13.052]  But now, we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[02:18:13.172 --> 02:18:18.016]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZX.
[02:18:18.036 --> 02:18:19.477]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[02:18:19.677 --> 02:18:25.722]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[02:18:25.762 --> 02:18:28.904]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[02:18:29.745 --> 02:18:31.966]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[02:18:32.787 --> 02:18:38.551]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:18:38.591 --> 02:18:44.594]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[02:18:45.015 --> 02:18:47.336]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[02:18:47.836 --> 02:18:53.380]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[02:18:55.111 --> 02:18:56.812]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[02:18:57.412 --> 02:18:58.752]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[02:18:58.972 --> 02:19:02.513]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[02:19:02.873 --> 02:19:10.616]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[02:19:10.816 --> 02:19:15.617]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:19:15.777 --> 02:19:21.239]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[02:19:21.599 --> 02:19:29.146]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[02:19:29.387 --> 02:19:33.831]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[02:19:34.111 --> 02:19:42.920]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:46.423]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[02:19:46.663 --> 02:19:50.367]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:50.567 --> 02:19:52.649]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:58.894 --> 02:20:01.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.379 --> 02:20:23.647]  You know... Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:23.907 --> 02:20:32.636]  And Kit Cope of Spikestactical.com, they got banned as the case point example of a company showing firearms demos to then sell firearms.
[02:20:32.696 --> 02:20:36.159]  But they moved on to a whole bunch of other people that are just showing firearms.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:43.502]  But the left in Hollywood can take gun sponsorship, they can run their ads showing guns being misused.
[02:20:43.762 --> 02:20:48.924]  The way to target them is to go, okay, are you going to kick Twitchy off with all its gun video games?
[02:20:49.184 --> 02:20:51.825]  Are you going to kick all these movie trailers off YouTube?
[02:20:52.085 --> 02:20:54.866]  Are people going to file suit because they're saying this is bad for the community?
[02:20:55.147 --> 02:21:01.029]  You said Spikes Tactical, well that means, just like Facebook, and I said this on Sunday, I said, their stock's going to plunge.
[02:21:02.049 --> 02:21:04.330]  Because they claim they don't want conservatives culling
[02:21:05.823 --> 02:21:06.143]  I don't
[02:21:24.778 --> 02:21:29.620]  And then now everybody's going to look at the business model of Facebook and go, well, they do that to the next power.
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:30.521]  Boom!
[02:21:30.941 --> 02:21:32.261]  The free fall can't be stopped.
[02:21:32.702 --> 02:21:38.644]  So the left's thinking one step ahead, going after our free speech, going after our guns, not knowing it mobilizes us.
[02:21:38.684 --> 02:21:42.406]  So as negative as this is, as long as you get motivated, we win.
[02:21:42.446 --> 02:21:43.727]  I don't know how to quantify this.
[02:21:44.367 --> 02:21:45.688]  They don't have this stuff in textbooks.
[02:21:45.708 --> 02:21:46.948]  They don't teach this stuff anywhere.
[02:21:47.528 --> 02:21:48.149]  I just know this.
[02:21:49.269 --> 02:21:50.150]  I was always a fighter.
[02:21:50.770 --> 02:21:59.456]  But the moment I got knocked down and learned to enjoy climbing back up, the animating contest that Jefferson talked about, that's when I really started living.
[02:22:00.177 --> 02:22:02.818]  So, they think it's like a reverse cry wolf.
[02:22:02.878 --> 02:22:04.299]  It's cry wolf, but it's the opposite direction.
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:12.485]  They keep banning, they keep censoring, they keep harassing, blocking our bank accounts, physically attacking us, trying to take our kids, doing all the stuff they do to patriots.
[02:22:13.205 --> 02:22:16.308]  They think you get sick of hearing about it, or maybe you get intimidated and just go away.
[02:22:17.208 --> 02:22:22.396]  Instead of, once you realize, I'm gonna want it more than the other guy, I have the will to keep going.
[02:22:22.756 --> 02:22:26.362]  It's fun to have these fights when it's about your family and your future.
[02:22:26.382 --> 02:22:28.164]  So I'm telling folks, long game.
[02:22:28.425 --> 02:22:28.845]  Commit!
[02:22:29.933 --> 02:22:33.496]  Make it when they attack you, like, I can't even stand it I get so much energy.
[02:22:33.516 --> 02:22:34.757]  It becomes obnoxious around here.
[02:22:35.117 --> 02:22:36.258]  I'm bouncing off the walls right now.
[02:22:36.498 --> 02:22:38.240]  Or another attack, I can't even hardly get it up.
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:39.360]  Okay, politically.
[02:22:39.841 --> 02:22:40.882]  This is it, folks.
[02:22:40.922 --> 02:22:42.503]  This is America.
[02:22:42.843 --> 02:22:43.464]  1776 Part 2.
[02:22:43.644 --> 02:22:44.685]  This is high-tech war.
[02:22:44.985 --> 02:22:45.525]  They are lying.
[02:22:45.565 --> 02:22:47.427]  I was just talking to Cope, smart guy, during the break.
[02:22:47.887 --> 02:22:48.968]  He said it's exponential.
[02:22:49.028 --> 02:22:49.749]  This is the assault.
[02:22:50.129 --> 02:22:50.970]  Everything was a test.
[02:22:51.310 --> 02:22:52.351]  It's beginning now.
[02:22:52.812 --> 02:22:57.196]  If they get control, folks, they want everything.
[02:22:57.236 --> 02:22:57.756]  So I'm ranting.
[02:22:57.776 --> 02:22:58.397]  You've got the floor.
[02:22:58.417 --> 02:23:02.601]  We're going to the next segment, the Laura Loomer of Breaking News, on the Democrats and their big anti-gun push.
[02:23:03.101 --> 02:23:04.001]  This is the assault.
[02:23:04.262 --> 02:23:06.042]  And to take down the second, they need the first.
[02:23:06.322 --> 02:23:08.483]  To take down the first, they've got to get the second.
[02:23:08.904 --> 02:23:10.464]  It's all hanging together.
[02:23:10.504 --> 02:23:11.545]  I can feel it in my gut.
[02:23:11.825 --> 02:23:12.765]  I can see it intellectually.
[02:23:13.025 --> 02:23:14.746]  Tell us what you think we ought to do and where we're going.
[02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:17.587]  And all the congressmen calling for Trump's death this weekend.
[02:23:17.887 --> 02:23:19.268]  I mean, they are out in the open right now.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:30.523]  Well, what most people are trying to do is trying to retreat and, you know, oh, well, we'll go build our own YouTube or something like that.
[02:23:30.783 --> 02:23:33.364]  I think that's the absolute wrong direction to take.
[02:23:34.284 --> 02:23:38.085]  I think that we need to stand firm and show them
[02:23:42.751 --> 02:23:49.475]  That we've espoused our constitutional rights as Americans, and this cannot happen in America.
[02:23:49.955 --> 02:23:54.938]  You can't do this in America and force us to make a separate America.
[02:23:55.639 --> 02:23:56.899]  This is how it's been here.
[02:23:56.919 --> 02:23:58.781]  This is how it's going to continue to be here.
[02:23:58.881 --> 02:24:00.101]  It has been successful.
[02:24:00.522 --> 02:24:03.743]  They've been attacking it for the last 60, 70 years.
[02:24:04.304 --> 02:24:06.025]  And now is the big ramp up.
[02:24:06.485 --> 02:24:07.786]  It was gradual before.
[02:24:08.616 --> 02:24:11.297]  And now it's moving exponentially faster.
[02:24:11.757 --> 02:24:13.458]  We got banned yesterday.
[02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:27.984]  If we didn't, or day before yesterday I guess, if we didn't make a stink, if we didn't get a bunch of calls from a bunch of news entities, if it didn't hit Drudge Report, we would still be banned.
[02:24:29.084 --> 02:24:34.807]  Two minutes after it hit Drudge Report, I was actually doing an interview with NBC,
[02:24:36.122 --> 02:24:40.004]  As she, as the interviewer, got an email from YouTube.
[02:24:40.364 --> 02:24:44.766]  Now, we didn't get an email saying, OK, by the way, you guys are you guys are reinstated.
[02:24:46.287 --> 02:24:50.069]  She got an email because she had reached out to YouTube for a comment.
[02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:58.632]  They sent her an email that said, hey, we've got so many videos on our platform that sometimes we make a mistake.
[02:24:59.173 --> 02:25:01.714]  So what you're telling me is that you're too successful?
[02:25:02.594 --> 02:25:06.618]  You've got too much business, too much success to actually police it properly.
[02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:11.162]  And what you're also telling me is that you shoot first and ask questions later.
[02:25:11.682 --> 02:25:20.130]  You just stripped us off of YouTube and then looked into our videos to see if there was something against your terms.
[02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:21.952]  And Kit, this is so critical.
[02:25:22.092 --> 02:25:22.933]  This is their tactic.
[02:25:22.973 --> 02:25:26.637]  They were in Bloomberg doing interviews of how you violated and you were bad.
[02:25:27.257 --> 02:25:28.158]  They know Drudge.
[02:25:28.178 --> 02:25:29.220]  You know why they threw him at Drudge?
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.022]  Not that this is the biggest news site in the world.
[02:25:31.522 --> 02:25:33.104]  The president reads it constantly.
[02:25:33.564 --> 02:25:36.627]  Though they knew that's in front of Trump and he gets on the phone.
[02:25:37.288 --> 02:25:47.898]  I'm not going to get into it, but the point is, Trump is in there constantly, he knows what's going on, and that's what's so crazy is, they fear Drudge because he looks at it more than even the New York Times.
[02:25:47.918 --> 02:25:49.560]  He looks at the New York Times way too much, I don't know why he does.
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:55.746]  But the point is, the President looks at Drudge, he looks at the New York Times, only looks at us like, you know, every few days, people bringing memos.
[02:25:55.766 --> 02:25:57.507]  But the point is, is that...
[02:25:58.288 --> 02:26:05.711]  That's what's happening, and so they try that tactic of, oh, it was one of our moderators, it's a mistake, hoping everybody doesn't reach critical mass.
[02:26:05.751 --> 02:26:08.752]  They keep waiting to ban everybody and have everybody be quiet.
[02:26:08.833 --> 02:26:11.334]  That's why this is so incredibly critical.
[02:26:11.894 --> 02:26:12.214]  Go ahead.
[02:26:13.094 --> 02:26:14.495]  Yeah, if we just shut up and went away.
[02:26:15.234 --> 02:26:16.315]  Nothing would have ever happened.
[02:26:16.495 --> 02:26:20.839]  We would have still been banned from YouTube, but we made a stink.
[02:26:20.939 --> 02:26:26.063]  We stood firm, just the same way we did with our print ad a couple months ago.
[02:26:26.324 --> 02:26:27.024]  We stood firm.
[02:26:27.064 --> 02:26:28.926]  We said, no, we're not going to stand for it.
[02:26:29.627 --> 02:26:33.230]  And next thing you know, oh, there's a lot of backpedaling going on.
[02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:42.798]  But they know that they're going to get us in a couple of days anyway, as soon as it turns to April and their new service terms become effective.
[02:26:43.607 --> 02:26:53.092]  Then they will actually be able to, they'll be able to scrub everything relating to guns and the Second Amendment off of their entire site.
[02:26:55.092 --> 02:26:58.954]  Well, it's here, and people tend to think like, oh, Spice Tactical, why do I care?
[02:26:58.974 --> 02:26:59.635]  That's not my website.
[02:27:00.055 --> 02:27:01.796]  It was thousands of sites a month ago.
[02:27:02.296 --> 02:27:03.376]  It's a full push.
[02:27:03.917 --> 02:27:06.738]  Then when there's people noticing what happened, they back off.
[02:27:06.778 --> 02:27:08.259]  And I'm seeing levels of lies now.
[02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:10.428]  I've never seen.
[02:27:10.968 --> 02:27:19.353]  NPR, CBS, NBC, they all ran articles yesterday, I've got them right here, saying Jones is being sued because he says no one died at Parkland.
[02:27:19.674 --> 02:27:20.514]  I never said that.
[02:27:20.874 --> 02:27:21.835]  There's no video.
[02:27:22.215 --> 02:27:23.736]  The lawsuit isn't even about that.
[02:27:24.256 --> 02:27:32.862]  But again, the media has gone from lying to next level lying to demonize those of us so they can silence us.
[02:27:33.622 --> 02:27:34.683]  It's just next level.
[02:27:35.762 --> 02:27:36.563]  There was a there.
[02:27:36.904 --> 02:27:38.146]  That's that's the exact point.
[02:27:38.186 --> 02:27:39.408]  It doesn't have to be true.
[02:27:39.428 --> 02:27:42.172]  They figure it's it's like it used to be.
[02:27:42.532 --> 02:27:46.218]  You know, they used to think, oh, well, if it's in print, it must be true.
[02:27:46.578 --> 02:27:47.740]  It doesn't have to be true.
[02:27:48.221 --> 02:27:48.842]  As a matter of fact,
[02:27:49.568 --> 02:27:53.289]  You know, a very small amount of it is actually truth.
[02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:57.491]  The Orlando Weekly did an interview.
[02:27:57.891 --> 02:28:00.632]  We invited them into the shop a couple of weeks ago.
[02:28:00.652 --> 02:28:02.253]  I took them for a tour.
[02:28:02.293 --> 02:28:03.493]  I explained what we did.
[02:28:03.513 --> 02:28:05.674]  We had a little a little discourse.
[02:28:06.995 --> 02:28:12.357]  And then next thing you know, the article comes out and they just demonize the hell out of us.
[02:28:13.057 --> 02:28:17.659]  They had something in the article talking about how they
[02:28:18.982 --> 02:28:21.763]  They had a test of the A.R.
[02:28:21.783 --> 02:28:23.183]  15 in Vietnam.
[02:28:23.323 --> 02:28:24.724]  First of all, there were no A.R.
[02:28:25.304 --> 02:28:26.264]  15s in Vietnam.
[02:28:26.805 --> 02:28:30.426]  It was an M16A1 that the A.R.
[02:28:30.446 --> 02:28:31.586]  15 came later.
[02:28:32.727 --> 02:28:39.749]  But it said the what this guy witnessed was an army ranger.
[02:28:41.133 --> 02:28:49.178]  Unleashed, in full auto, on a Vietcong, and the first shot took his head completely off, and the second shot took his arm completely off.
[02:28:49.998 --> 02:28:51.679]  That, that doesn't happen.
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:53.961]  Sure, it's a witness to their fiction.
[02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:05.731]  Look at this report from LifeSite.
[02:29:05.891 --> 02:29:14.656]  Facebook says group wanting to burn alive Christian mom meets community standards, but she's banned from Twitter.
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:23.901]  So we're going to talk to a lady who's reached billions of people and who they're targeting and who's been banned from Twitter, the activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston.
[02:29:24.641 --> 02:29:31.905]  So Elizabeth, let's get into why you're so hated, why you're so feared, and why they're trying to ban you.
[02:29:32.813 --> 02:29:33.634]  Hi, Alex.
[02:29:33.774 --> 02:29:37.157]  Look, you know, I don't toe the line.
[02:29:37.937 --> 02:29:41.380]  And I am pushing back against some of their pet agendas.
[02:29:42.261 --> 02:29:49.667]  I push back against the feminazis and the LGBT agenda and the slaughtering of children through abortion.
[02:29:50.407 --> 02:29:50.988]  We're good to go.
[02:30:05.485 --> 02:30:07.947]  You know, I am being censored frequently.
[02:30:08.207 --> 02:30:16.594]  And right now, there's a story going that there's a group on Facebook called I Will Find Activist Mommy and Burn Whoever Runs It Alive.
[02:30:17.574 --> 02:30:20.617]  And people, hundreds, thousands of people have reported it.
[02:30:21.257 --> 02:30:28.423]  And Facebook said that that death threat does not go against their community standards and they're not going to remove the group.
[02:30:29.083 --> 02:30:30.545]  Oh yeah, tell folks about that!
[02:30:50.564 --> 02:30:57.948]  Yeah, they printed a tutorial online of how to have anal sex.
[02:30:58.648 --> 02:31:03.450]  And I was livid, as were millions of parents.
[02:31:03.991 --> 02:31:10.854]  And so I filmed a quick two-minute video, burned a T-Pose magazine, called it smut, and called upon
[02:31:11.614 --> 02:31:22.939]  The public to go to their stores and their libraries and make sure that Teen Vogue was not being carried, that it was being pulled from the shelves.
[02:31:22.999 --> 02:31:26.260]  We started hashtag Operation Pull Teen Vogue.
[02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:34.343]  And as you probably know, we gave Teen Vogue such a black eye that they have not recovered from it.
[02:31:34.463 --> 02:31:38.805]  And they actually had to shutter their print edition.
[02:31:38.825 --> 02:31:40.426]  December was their last
[02:31:41.169 --> 02:31:46.161]  Print edition because we have really done such damage to their reputation.
[02:31:55.580 --> 02:31:56.301]  I'm so excited.
[02:31:56.321 --> 02:32:05.947]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:32:06.527 --> 02:32:11.711]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:32:12.031 --> 02:32:14.833]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:32:15.053 --> 02:32:23.799]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:35.469]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:32:36.189 --> 02:32:45.017]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:32:45.517 --> 02:32:46.818]  It is amazing!
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:53.184]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:32:58.849 --> 02:33:01.570]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.434 --> 02:33:11.655]  The answer to 1984.
[02:33:11.855 --> 02:33:16.177]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:17.758 --> 02:33:20.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.319 --> 02:33:21.859]  Okay, Laura Loomer's awesome.
[02:33:21.919 --> 02:33:25.201]  I'm backing her up until about 15 minutes from now and I'm going to host her to the fourth hour.
[02:33:25.921 --> 02:33:27.382]  Trump is so on target.
[02:33:28.655 --> 02:33:39.464]  Other than his virtue signaling on guns that Ted Nugent told me personally, the backstory, they have an algorithm, a way to dynamite the Democrats, and we'll see if it works, but in Florida they're still going after him, so I don't know if I agree with that.
[02:33:40.525 --> 02:33:43.287]  But I'm saying Trump do something about free speech being attacked.
[02:33:43.327 --> 02:33:57.638]  He's meeting with a leader for high school students' rights about conservatives being censored everywhere, and Trump was just pledging live, during the break we were watching it, to stand up against attacks on free speech and to move against political correctness.
[02:33:58.757 --> 02:34:10.190]  Last time I talked to Trump, months ago, I said, please, they're coming after, they're cutting your base off, they're turning your volume down, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they're censoring everybody, and he said we're going to do something about it.
[02:34:11.033 --> 02:34:13.495]  And so you see that going on.
[02:34:14.015 --> 02:34:15.316]  So they're trying to censor ahead of the 2018.
[02:34:15.356 --> 02:34:17.517]  That's only months away now.
[02:34:17.537 --> 02:34:18.918]  We're talking four or five months away.
[02:34:20.659 --> 02:34:21.540]  Let me play a clip of this.
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.581]  We'll go back to Kit Cope here to talk about this.
[02:34:24.662 --> 02:34:26.222]  Again, it's all connected.
[02:34:26.383 --> 02:34:29.324]  All 10 Bill of Rights are integral to a free society.
[02:34:29.585 --> 02:34:30.385]  They don't give you rights.
[02:34:30.405 --> 02:34:31.346]  They point out basic
[02:34:32.006 --> 02:34:37.829]  Common law, inalienable, grassroots, organic law is what it's called, natural law.
[02:34:38.409 --> 02:34:39.890]  But Trump is moving.
[02:34:40.470 --> 02:34:45.273]  And let me tell you, 50 billion tariff to start on China, 60 billion tariff, that sends a message.
[02:34:45.453 --> 02:34:49.595]  Only Communist China is left funding the globalists in this country.
[02:34:49.735 --> 02:34:50.576]  They're almost cut off.
[02:34:51.216 --> 02:34:51.556]  We are.
[02:34:51.876 --> 02:34:53.557]  That's why they're squealing and fighting so hard.
[02:34:53.997 --> 02:34:55.038]  But I don't want to be overconfident.
[02:34:55.865 --> 02:34:56.725]  But this is it!
[02:34:56.826 --> 02:34:59.407]  You want to be involved in the Second American Revolution, baby?
[02:34:59.427 --> 02:35:04.470]  Doesn't mean our leader's perfect, but my God, he's a patriot, he's strong, he's fearless, and he's doing it.
[02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:06.731]  So here's Trump right now hearing about it.
[02:35:09.082 --> 02:35:27.948]  Shifting gears for a minute here, one of the other things that you've done so successfully during your campaign and presidency is crush political correctness and what the college network that we represent, I represent an organization on 1,200 college and high school campuses, is it's harder than ever to espouse support of your presidency and the ideas that you're fighting for.
[02:35:28.328 --> 02:35:32.974]  So thank you for what you're doing to help give us the courage of our convictions to fight against political correctness.
[02:35:33.034 --> 02:35:43.406]  But what advice do you have for young patriots and conservatives on campus that support your agenda that are being ridiculed and silenced because of administrators that are clamping down on free speech?
[02:35:43.766 --> 02:35:44.907]  Socialite's a great question.
[02:35:44.947 --> 02:35:47.368]  I think the numbers are actually much different than people think.
[02:35:47.428 --> 02:35:48.809]  I think we have a lot of support.
[02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:54.593]  If they have one campus or two campuses, and we know what they are, it gets all the publicity.
[02:35:54.893 --> 02:36:01.757]  We have campuses where you have a vast majority of people that are perhaps like many of the people in this room.
[02:36:02.417 --> 02:36:06.600]  You could call it conservative, you call it whatever you want, but there are people that
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:07.882]  Want free speech?
[02:36:08.022 --> 02:36:16.856]  If you look at what's going on with free speech, with the super left, with Antifa, with all of these characters, I'll tell you what, they get a lot of publicity.
[02:36:17.617 --> 02:36:20.639]  But you go to the real campuses, and you go all over the country.
[02:36:20.739 --> 02:36:24.702]  You go out to the Middle West, you go out even to the coast in many cases.
[02:36:25.663 --> 02:36:27.344]  We have tremendous support.
[02:36:27.364 --> 02:36:29.005]  I would say we have majority support.
[02:36:29.025 --> 02:36:30.726]  I think it's highly overblown.
[02:36:31.087 --> 02:36:31.767]  Highly overblown.
[02:36:31.827 --> 02:36:33.768]  I totally agree, and we see it on the ground.
[02:36:33.849 --> 02:36:35.810]  And some people say, hey, I'm a Trump supporter.
[02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:40.213]  I'm just not allowed to say it because of the culture that's been created by the administrators and the professors.
[02:36:40.213 --> 02:36:41.614]  Alright, that's Generation Next.
[02:36:41.714 --> 02:36:44.215]  I was actually on a plane ride with that guy back from D.C.
[02:36:44.255 --> 02:36:45.956]  So that's crazy.
[02:36:45.996 --> 02:36:46.817]  Generation Next.
[02:36:47.237 --> 02:36:48.018]  I love their logo.
[02:36:48.078 --> 02:36:50.019]  It's like the blue country turning red.
[02:36:50.899 --> 02:36:53.081]  So we'll pull up maybe their website and show Generation Next.
[02:36:53.801 --> 02:36:54.862]  Going back to Kit Cope.
[02:36:54.882 --> 02:36:57.383]  So they're having a whole deal about free speech and the attacks on it.
[02:36:57.963 --> 02:36:59.044]  But we have to move.
[02:36:59.064 --> 02:37:00.425]  We can't be too confident because
[02:37:01.567 --> 02:37:02.888]  They're rolling it out worldwide.
[02:37:02.908 --> 02:37:10.052]  The EU is telling Google and Facebook, we're going to fine you billions of dollars, like they already have, if you don't involve yourself in free speech restriction.
[02:37:10.472 --> 02:37:12.633]  How are foreign powers telling us what to do?
[02:37:12.673 --> 02:37:14.854]  Just like Turkey's telling the EU what to do.
[02:37:14.874 --> 02:37:17.496]  I mean, this is, you know, foreign entanglements.
[02:37:17.536 --> 02:37:18.536]  This is manipulation.
[02:37:18.937 --> 02:37:25.280]  So, looking at this, Democratic congressman over the weekend said, use Second Amendment to take out Trump.
[02:37:26.161 --> 02:37:28.022]  That's Congressman Tom Swoozy in New York.
[02:37:28.979 --> 02:37:29.939]  I have another congressman.
[02:37:30.399 --> 02:37:31.340]  Trump is a security threat.
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.940]  Time to get the guy out.
[02:37:34.121 --> 02:37:38.942]  So that's another one of these congressmen, John Garamendi.
[02:37:39.222 --> 02:37:47.945]  Well, let's play the clip, though, from the town hall of this guy calling for covert, illegal action in America to kill the president.
[02:37:47.985 --> 02:37:48.425]  Here it is.
[02:37:49.205 --> 02:37:57.908]  You know, it's really a matter of putting public pressure on the president and making it public, which is hard to break through the news cycle and all the different things.
[02:37:58.687 --> 02:38:01.269]  And it's probably about going to the courts as well.
[02:38:02.370 --> 02:38:11.678]  And then, you know, I mean, this is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly, because, you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts?
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:13.440]  What would you do?
[02:38:14.101 --> 02:38:14.641]  What would we do?
[02:38:17.814 --> 02:38:22.416]  One of those idiots, that's what it does.
[02:38:22.436 --> 02:38:27.338]  Look at those useless, weak, stupid, I'm sorry, that's what they are, losers.
[02:38:28.058 --> 02:38:35.801]  They're sitting there talking about using our right against us and our elected president and hypothetically saying what if he ignores the courts when they've been ignoring the courts.
[02:38:36.622 --> 02:38:39.883]  And then I've got all these other congressmen calling for violence, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:38:40.503 --> 02:38:43.265]  They know they're losing, so they're pushing violence.
[02:38:43.305 --> 02:38:46.226]  And all I'm saying is, I support the president.
[02:38:47.066 --> 02:38:48.388]  I'm the anti-police state guy.
[02:38:49.369 --> 02:38:51.351]  But a police state means letting them act like this.
[02:38:51.992 --> 02:38:59.540]  At some point, there's gotta be pushback against people that are openly financed by foreign powers, calling for violence, calling for this stuff on a daily basis.
[02:38:59.941 --> 02:39:01.663]  Biden's saying he's gonna beat the president up.
[02:39:01.703 --> 02:39:02.944]  He says, I'll kick your ass back.
[02:39:03.205 --> 02:39:04.686]  The media says Trump's threatening Biden.
[02:39:05.734 --> 02:39:07.136]  I'm not calling for any violence.
[02:39:07.216 --> 02:39:12.264]  I'm not trying to call shots or any of this just because, you know, I trust Trump and I know we're winning in a lot of ways.
[02:39:12.324 --> 02:39:21.257]  But I'm, as a man, who's been all informational, really having to go through steps now in my brain and flip switches I've never flipped.
[02:39:22.058 --> 02:39:28.782]  Uh, dealing with armed criminal groups openly attacking me, attacking others, calling for our deaths.
[02:39:29.162 --> 02:39:34.045]  And so I'm having to go down a threat continuum here and trying, you know, starting to wake up some things.
[02:39:34.105 --> 02:39:36.787]  And I just, I'm just wondering, what do we do?
[02:39:36.847 --> 02:39:39.308]  Because are we going to wait until they launch giant violent attacks?
[02:39:39.328 --> 02:39:39.908]  They already have.
[02:39:39.928 --> 02:39:44.191]  The New York Times already advertises where to go kill congressmen, you know, at their baseball practices.
[02:39:44.251 --> 02:39:49.294]  So what do you as a, you know, a guy that's been involved in a lot of these covert operations, what do you think?
[02:39:51.471 --> 02:40:06.600]  Man, the only real way I think that it's going to come back around and start heading in our direction again is to basically wait until they actually do something actionable.
[02:40:07.783 --> 02:40:17.151]  Right now they're trying to be really slick and trying to use private enterprise or at least under the guise of private enterprise.
[02:40:17.171 --> 02:40:19.973]  And they're trying to hype somebody else going out and being violent.
[02:40:20.313 --> 02:40:22.055]  They're just showing the wind for violence.
[02:40:23.101 --> 02:40:29.286]  Exactly, which is where all of your where all of your crisis actors come in and and all your false flag events.
[02:40:29.326 --> 02:40:36.111]  And there have been way more than people, even the people that that I know that know of these false flag events.
[02:40:36.712 --> 02:40:40.615]  There have been way more than that, way more than most people even know.
[02:40:40.635 --> 02:40:49.422]  And I think it's actually going to come down to the president actually having to do something himself.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:59.688]  Because there's way too much support on the left because they don't care about facts.
[02:40:59.849 --> 02:41:02.191]  They don't care about realism.
[02:41:02.531 --> 02:41:04.493]  They care about sensationalism.
[02:41:05.213 --> 02:41:07.115]  They care about emotionalism.
[02:41:08.036 --> 02:41:11.419]  And so they don't need to know the facts.
[02:41:11.779 --> 02:41:12.820]  So what's going to happen is
[02:41:13.855 --> 02:41:23.389]  Once they kick us out of the limelight, they kick us out of the social media, they take us out of the public eye, well then it'll be a lot easier to attempt to take the guns.
[02:41:26.614 --> 02:41:27.195]  And that's it.
[02:41:27.235 --> 02:41:28.637]  We know the patterns of tyranny.
[02:41:28.677 --> 02:41:29.678]  We know they're attempting...
[02:41:30.834 --> 02:41:32.075]  Kind of a communist takeover.
[02:41:32.095 --> 02:41:34.736]  They're not communists themselves, they just want power, but they're using that model.
[02:41:34.756 --> 02:41:44.980]  And so that's all I'm saying is, just like you said, I talked to a lot of smart folks, high-level Pentagon, you name it, and they're like, I know you can't say it, Alex, but this stuff is actually staged, a lot of it.
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:59.846]  I mean, yeah, and then like, PSYOP-wise, people aren't ready to accept it, and they're pissed that we keep getting involved in their PSYOPs and exposing them, and it's just quite a time to be alive, and all I'm saying is, if they step off the porch,
[02:42:00.606 --> 02:42:04.790]  With a big attempted call of our leadership, we've got to be ready not to sit around and think.
[02:42:04.810 --> 02:42:12.117]  Everybody's already got to be in the battle space of who's the enemy, who's been leading things in your area, where if they throw the first punch, BAM!
[02:42:12.357 --> 02:42:13.738]  Instinctively, we've got to throw it right back.
[02:42:13.958 --> 02:42:15.280]  We've got to decapitate them fast.
[02:42:16.823 --> 02:42:26.292]  Yeah, and we've got, we've, we largely have the support of the military and law enforcement as well, which is, which I don't think that people really, uh, grasp.
[02:42:26.692 --> 02:42:34.660]  Um, you know, if, if they say, you know, okay, hey, this, this, uh, you know, military division, I need you to go out and take these people's guns over here.
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:38.804]  Um, I just don't think that's gonna happen because those are our people.
[02:42:39.278 --> 02:42:40.720]  Let's talk about that scenario briefly.
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:45.486]  We're going to get Laura Loomer on for about 20 minutes to the next hour, and then John Rappaport's going to take over.
[02:42:45.546 --> 02:42:48.911]  And we have to talk about this because we've been winning politically.
[02:42:49.031 --> 02:42:52.155]  They want to get violent because they're losing the peace game.
[02:42:52.475 --> 02:42:53.437]  We just have to be ready.
[02:42:55.379 --> 02:43:04.404]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:04.464 --> 02:43:12.568]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:12.868 --> 02:43:17.492]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:17.672 --> 02:43:24.418]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:24.458 --> 02:43:31.563]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:31.643 --> 02:43:38.509]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:38.649 --> 02:43:43.013]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:43.154 --> 02:43:46.397]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:46.537 --> 02:43:52.683]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[02:44:01.653 --> 02:44:07.535]  Peter Schiff of EuroPAC.com, American businessman, investor, broker, billions under management.
[02:44:07.555 --> 02:44:08.556]  I'm not going to get into his bio.
[02:44:08.576 --> 02:44:11.437]  Everybody knows he's a best-selling author, run for Senate, things like that.
[02:44:11.717 --> 02:44:14.098]  Was Ron Paul's chief economic advisor.
[02:44:14.378 --> 02:44:15.439]  Peter, good to have you back with us.
[02:44:15.579 --> 02:44:18.460]  Thanks for having me on, and Happy New Year to you and your audience.
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:23.062]  And, you know, I agree with you, the economy is going to blow up, but, you know, it's going to blow up like a bomb.
[02:44:23.482 --> 02:44:24.343]  It's not a good thing.
[02:44:24.883 --> 02:44:25.764]  It's a bad thing.
[02:44:26.185 --> 02:44:30.749]  You know, unfortunately, that's what Trump has inherited from Obama.
[02:44:30.809 --> 02:44:32.791]  But it's not even really just Obama.
[02:44:32.851 --> 02:44:33.852]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:33.892 --> 02:44:41.919]  It's the monetary policy that has been passed like a baton from Clinton to Bush to Obama and now to Trump.
[02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:44.021]  And we're near the end of the game.
[02:44:44.061 --> 02:44:46.804]  And unfortunately, Trump's going to be the fall guy.
[02:44:46.824 --> 02:44:49.467]  This thing is all going to collapse while he's president.
[02:44:49.968 --> 02:44:51.750]  And he owns the stock market bubble.
[02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:55.434]  He and the Republicans own the economy now thanks to these tax cuts.
[02:44:55.735 --> 02:45:00.280]  They're not going to make any difference, but they are going to give the Democrats a reason to blame it all
[02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:02.261]  On Trump and the Republicans.
[02:45:20.896 --> 02:45:21.517]  I don't know.
[02:45:37.239 --> 02:45:38.779]  And now he has set everybody up.
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:46.781]  He has raised everybody's expectations so high that when everything comes crashing down, not only will he get blamed, but everyone's going to be disappointed.
[02:45:46.821 --> 02:45:49.462]  When the dollar collapses, it wipes out the middle class.
[02:45:49.762 --> 02:45:51.122]  People are going to be impoverished.
[02:45:51.403 --> 02:45:52.543]  And they're going to blame Trump.
[02:45:52.563 --> 02:45:55.704]  You know, there are a lot of people who voted for Trump out of frustration.
[02:45:56.004 --> 02:45:56.984]  He promised a lot.
[02:45:57.024 --> 02:45:57.884]  He talked big.
[02:45:58.124 --> 02:45:59.405]  He is not going to deliver.
[02:45:59.745 --> 02:46:01.185]  And that is going to be used against him.
[02:46:01.665 --> 02:46:04.466]  And it's going to ultimately be used against the country.
[02:46:04.666 --> 02:46:06.106]  Waiting to see how bad things get.
[02:46:06.126 --> 02:46:07.067]  You know these tax cuts?
[02:46:07.367 --> 02:46:08.287]  They're all temporary.
[02:46:08.327 --> 02:46:09.247]  They're all going away in 2021.
[02:46:09.367 --> 02:46:15.109]  What do you think the Democrats are going to do when they have the White House and both houses of Congress?
[02:46:15.509 --> 02:46:18.330]  How high do you think they're going to jack taxes up on corporations?
[02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:20.411]  What do you think they're going to do to entrepreneurs?
[02:46:20.891 --> 02:46:22.031]  This is a disaster.
[02:46:22.332 --> 02:46:26.793]  We had a chance to defuse this if Trump would have owned up to the problems of the economy.
[02:46:26.993 --> 02:46:27.913]  They weren't his fault.
[02:46:28.133 --> 02:46:29.914]  He could have blamed it all on his predecessor.
[02:46:30.234 --> 02:46:35.598]  And he could have finally put politics aside and done the right thing for this country.
[02:46:35.658 --> 02:46:41.282]  Instead, he acted just like all the other presidents who have just, you know, continued to kick the can down the road.
[02:46:41.342 --> 02:46:43.884]  I don't think he acted like all of them on social issues.
[02:46:44.725 --> 02:46:47.227]  If he's right, it'll be a great time for investors to buy stuff up.
[02:46:47.287 --> 02:46:49.328]  I like the communist Chinese.
[02:46:49.389 --> 02:46:49.789]  We'll be back.
[02:46:58.741 --> 02:47:02.905]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.233 --> 02:47:20.760]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.261 --> 02:47:23.862]  It was 20 years ago, 21 years ago,
[02:47:28.547 --> 02:47:43.235]  In 1996, the head of emergency management in South Texas, who was an Army veteran himself, and the San Antonio police chief, who was an Army veteran, Army intelligence, said that Delta Force was trying to buy them off and was training for gun confiscation.
[02:47:43.895 --> 02:47:51.059]  Now I went down and interviewed them, and it wasn't that the Army was bad, it wasn't that Delta Force was bad, they were following orders of Bill Clinton.
[02:47:52.359 --> 02:47:54.721]  And then Delta Force gave the head of the SWAT team
[02:47:55.828 --> 02:47:58.590]  Information from me saying we're not involved, but here's what's going on.
[02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:01.152]  A month later, I didn't even announce the guy's name.
[02:48:01.192 --> 02:48:03.393]  They fired the guy off the head of the SWAT team.
[02:48:03.413 --> 02:48:05.074]  Because they had him all surveilled.
[02:48:05.515 --> 02:48:06.055]  So here's the deal.
[02:48:06.355 --> 02:48:07.816]  This has been going on for a while.
[02:48:08.737 --> 02:48:10.678]  Bill Clinton tried to get martial law set up.
[02:48:10.878 --> 02:48:11.959]  He couldn't get the military to do it.
[02:48:12.459 --> 02:48:13.840]  So how did the media then spin it?
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:14.861]  ABC, NBC.
[02:48:15.181 --> 02:48:16.902]  Jones hates the military and hates police.
[02:48:17.203 --> 02:48:19.364]  He thinks your local police officer wants martial law.
[02:48:19.624 --> 02:48:20.345]  He hates cops.
[02:48:22.056 --> 02:48:27.022]  Then cops would believe it, be jerked to me, and then I kind of bought into it for a while until I got a little more sophisticated.
[02:48:27.082 --> 02:48:28.083]  I mean, I'm only 44 now.
[02:48:28.123 --> 02:48:28.744]  I'm still dumb.
[02:48:29.705 --> 02:48:30.326]  But I'm trying.
[02:48:30.386 --> 02:48:31.086]  I'm figuring it out.
[02:48:31.667 --> 02:48:40.678]  And so what Kit Cope was talking about, a patriot, a guy that's done clandestine operations, you name it, world champion MMA guy, and Muay Thai patriot.
[02:48:42.617 --> 02:48:48.201]  Is that it's our own military and police that are the key to this not happening because they are actually awake.
[02:48:48.962 --> 02:48:51.744]  So when they try, the media spends this like we hate the military and police.
[02:48:51.784 --> 02:48:53.905]  No, they're the ones that don't want to be used for tyranny.
[02:48:54.406 --> 02:48:58.148]  They're the ones that don't want to back up Black Lives Matter and Hillary and people shooting cops in the back.
[02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:59.429]  So they play these games.
[02:49:01.091 --> 02:49:04.353]  And I got some incredible footage from city council that just happened live with Owen Schroer.
[02:49:04.373 --> 02:49:05.354]  I'm going to get to here in a minute.
[02:49:05.934 --> 02:49:07.315]  And we got big breaking news after that.
[02:49:07.355 --> 02:49:10.858]  But Kit, when I sit here and I talk about preparing for war and violence,
[02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:13.810]  I've done everything I've done with information.
[02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:16.211]  I know the First Amendment's numero uno if you've got it.
[02:49:17.152 --> 02:49:19.293]  I've just seen what they do behind the scenes, up front.
[02:49:19.373 --> 02:49:20.654]  They're spoiling for a fight.
[02:49:21.295 --> 02:49:24.116]  There's communists on the streets everywhere intimidating people, pointing guns.
[02:49:24.917 --> 02:49:27.218]  You guys stood up to Antifa and you got banned off YouTube.
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:30.961]  They really think they're going to make their move.
[02:49:31.401 --> 02:49:33.202]  And look, we've all had somebody start a fight with us.
[02:49:33.222 --> 02:49:34.523]  You can tell they don't know what they're doing.
[02:49:34.823 --> 02:49:36.184]  They punch you and knock them in the head.
[02:49:36.204 --> 02:49:37.305]  They can't believe they hit the ground.
[02:49:38.413 --> 02:49:40.734]  But this is guns, this is government, this is weapons.
[02:49:41.054 --> 02:49:42.394]  We don't want them throwing that punch.
[02:49:42.874 --> 02:49:49.396]  And I just can't believe the SWAT teams, the Justice Department, Trump, with people like Phil Mudd and others, saying we're going to kill the President.
[02:49:49.916 --> 02:49:51.837]  Well, Phil Mudd ought to get SWAT teamed, you know?
[02:49:51.857 --> 02:49:54.497]  He ought to get his ass drug in front of a judge.
[02:49:54.617 --> 02:49:58.018]  I mean, you know, they're trying to really start a damn war here.
[02:49:58.338 --> 02:50:00.019]  I don't want violence, I want it to stop.
[02:50:00.519 --> 02:50:07.441]  But I know this, if it kicks off, we're not just going to sit here in our houses while they have their special little liberal police units come for us.
[02:50:08.021 --> 02:50:11.363]  And that's all I'm trying to say is we need, I don't know what we need to do, Kent.
[02:50:11.383 --> 02:50:11.843]  What do you think?
[02:50:11.863 --> 02:50:12.803]  I mean, because it's everywhere.
[02:50:14.104 --> 02:50:23.288]  Well, they're basically, it's like the, uh, the guy that you argue with that knows that he's wrong, that knows that he doesn't have a good point.
[02:50:23.988 --> 02:50:27.510]  And since he knows that, then he automatically turns to violence.
[02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:30.612]  And they're kind of trying to put that on us.
[02:50:30.752 --> 02:50:33.635]  We're the violent ones because we have the guns.
[02:50:34.136 --> 02:50:34.576]  No, no, no.
[02:50:35.157 --> 02:50:38.079]  We are the peaceful ones because we have the guns.
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:40.362]  We don't want the violence.
[02:50:40.622 --> 02:50:41.643]  We're not domesticated.
[02:50:42.704 --> 02:50:45.747]  But we're absolutely prepared to deal with the violence.
[02:50:48.692 --> 02:50:50.774]  All I'm saying is, everybody better get straight.
[02:50:50.914 --> 02:50:52.576]  We are in a crisis situation.
[02:50:52.816 --> 02:50:54.238]  We weren't just going to take the country back.
[02:50:54.298 --> 02:50:55.199]  It was not going to be easy.
[02:50:55.559 --> 02:50:56.240]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:59.844]  People need to understand, the danger now is ten times what it was two years ago.
[02:51:00.264 --> 02:51:00.845]  Do you agree, Kit?
[02:51:01.786 --> 02:51:02.787]  Absolutely.
[02:51:02.807 --> 02:51:02.787]  100%.
[02:51:03.527 --> 02:51:08.713]  And it's rapidly getting worse.
[02:51:09.233 --> 02:51:09.754]  Rapidly.
[02:51:10.194 --> 02:51:10.735]  Day by day.
[02:51:12.577 --> 02:51:18.521]  And you know, I think our restraint is why they're ratcheting up, but I get our restraints good, because whoever shoots first loses generally.
[02:51:18.981 --> 02:51:20.722]  They're going to stage stuff and blame it on us anyways.
[02:51:21.763 --> 02:51:22.623]  I know Trump's smart.
[02:51:22.843 --> 02:51:23.784]  They know what they're doing.
[02:51:23.804 --> 02:51:25.925]  He's really, he's rolling out hard now, right now.
[02:51:26.666 --> 02:51:34.591]  And we just all need to be very vigilant, very active, and very aggressive to let them know, politically, we're not putting up with this.
[02:51:34.611 --> 02:51:39.334]  But George Soros and all these globalists that have pushed this crap, anybody that's called for violence.
[02:51:40.208 --> 02:51:45.829]  If violence starts on their side, they're all guilty, and I think they've all signed their death warrant.
[02:51:46.289 --> 02:51:47.230]  And I'm just leaving it at that.
[02:51:47.470 --> 02:52:00.192]  You call for killing the president, or killing veterans, or killing police, or killing patriots, or killing constitutionalists, and then the killing starts, any of you that called for it, you gave the order, you're an officer, an enemy combatant, and that's all I'm saying.
[02:52:00.352 --> 02:52:04.493]  And I think the military body, just like Santa Claus, needs to start making their list.
[02:52:04.753 --> 02:52:06.194]  And I don't say that to bravado.
[02:52:06.514 --> 02:52:08.014]  I mean, it's time, Kit.
[02:52:09.358 --> 02:52:23.571]  There's a huge difference between, you were talking about the training before, training SWAT officers and National Guard and what not to actually go house to house and take the guns back.
[02:52:24.012 --> 02:52:30.238]  There's a big difference in training because you've been ordered to train and you want to keep your job.
[02:52:30.818 --> 02:52:35.862]  And wasn't it the gun confiscation drills of Obama and Clinton that woke the military up?
[02:52:52.521 --> 02:52:53.722]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:52:54.062 --> 02:52:54.583]  Absolutely.
[02:52:54.623 --> 02:53:02.009]  And you've seen a lot of extremely disenfranchised veterans as of late speaking on the matter.
[02:53:02.969 --> 02:53:04.531]  Man, I gotta tell you, I don't just say that.
[02:53:04.571 --> 02:53:05.471]  I was the globalist.
[02:53:05.571 --> 02:53:06.592]  They got a tiger by the tail.
[02:53:06.612 --> 02:53:07.473]  They need to back off.
[02:53:07.973 --> 02:53:14.118]  You've got 50 million combat veterans conservatively ready to go, and they're not looking for trouble, but they're not afraid to die.
[02:53:14.138 --> 02:53:14.899]  They're not rolling over.
[02:53:15.953 --> 02:53:20.280]  Yeah, you're picking, you're definitely picking the absolute wrong, look at these people.
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:24.246]  You're picking the wrong fight with the wrong people.
[02:53:25.427 --> 02:53:26.829]  We don't have to hide our faces.
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:29.841]  Because we're not doing anything wrong.
[02:53:30.461 --> 02:53:34.643]  We don't have to be anonymous because we'll stand by our actions.
[02:53:34.663 --> 02:53:35.083]  No, I agree, Kit.
[02:53:35.183 --> 02:53:38.725]  All I'm saying is, these are the front idiots, the useful idiots of Lenin.
[02:53:39.225 --> 02:53:45.328]  We have to deal with the congressmen who have been calling for violence and who are orchestrating it.
[02:53:45.708 --> 02:53:46.809]  They are the enemy.
[02:53:47.629 --> 02:53:48.209]  They are the ones.
[02:53:48.229 --> 02:53:49.489]  And all it is is populism.
[02:53:49.850 --> 02:53:50.690]  It's just populism.
[02:53:51.350 --> 02:54:00.512]  They're putting out there what they think that all of these, all of the new millennials, which is what, millennials make up a third of our population?
[02:54:00.772 --> 02:54:01.272]  Sure, sure.
[02:54:01.412 --> 02:54:06.694]  If I went to a city meeting and said to my listeners, go use the Second Amendment on the President, I should be arrested.
[02:54:07.074 --> 02:54:07.854]  I have influence.
[02:54:08.174 --> 02:54:09.154]  I'm a serious person.
[02:54:09.454 --> 02:54:10.614]  If I said that, I should be arrested.
[02:54:10.814 --> 02:54:12.795]  You're not allowed to go around and organize murder.
[02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:15.470]  Absolutely, and you should be.
[02:54:15.930 --> 02:54:17.010]  And these people should be.
[02:54:17.191 --> 02:54:21.473]  It's like the mayors of these cities saying resist ICE when they have warrants and fight them.
[02:54:21.953 --> 02:54:23.154]  I mean, that's illegal!
[02:54:24.554 --> 02:54:25.915]  It's extremely illegal.
[02:54:26.295 --> 02:54:31.418]  But legal and illegal is such a blurred line right now.
[02:54:33.945 --> 02:54:34.585]  Kit, thank you.
[02:54:34.605 --> 02:54:36.046]  Spikestactical.com.
[02:54:36.146 --> 02:54:36.947]  Anybody can go there.
[02:54:37.467 --> 02:54:39.008]  5% off promo code Alex.
[02:54:40.089 --> 02:54:40.609]  You stood up.
[02:54:40.669 --> 02:54:42.330]  You didn't bend over, so they reinstated it.
[02:54:42.350 --> 02:54:43.291]  They're playing major games.
[02:54:43.311 --> 02:54:47.794]  You have amazing, some of the best products out there from suppression to beyond that.
[02:54:47.834 --> 02:54:48.374]  It's all there.
[02:54:48.454 --> 02:54:50.255]  Infowars.com.
[02:54:50.315 --> 02:54:54.078]  Newswars.com is our site.
[02:54:54.098 --> 02:54:55.599]  So Kit Cope, thank you so much.
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:57.620]  Alright, stay vigilant.
[02:55:21.519 --> 02:55:21.980]  Powerful.
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:23.722]  It's only been on local cable so far.
[02:55:23.742 --> 02:55:25.444]  We're going to premiere that as well in the next hour.
[02:55:26.485 --> 02:55:32.713]  He got up and put a mask on in front of the city council and pointed out that Antifa pointed guns and wouldn't let him go to an event a few months ago.
[02:55:32.753 --> 02:55:33.454]  You all saw that.
[02:55:34.955 --> 02:55:40.002]  Just briefly though, we can win this a hundred percent.
[02:55:42.298 --> 02:55:47.480]  But I've said I want to sue Tom Brokaw for all the stuff he did to us and a few other people.
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:49.141]  That's going to cost a half million dollars.
[02:55:49.881 --> 02:55:54.463]  And then to fight the six lawsuits we haven't thrown out, six did fall, that's going to cost money.
[02:55:55.043 --> 02:55:57.425]  I don't want to just sit here and not expand on their face.
[02:55:57.465 --> 02:56:05.608]  So we got products and vitamins and minerals and supplements and the best stuff out there and great t-shirts and just, you know, it's all there.
[02:56:05.648 --> 02:56:06.708]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:06.728 --> 02:56:09.750]  We've got Trump Pence 2020 Keeping America Great t-shirt.
[02:56:10.814 --> 02:56:13.696]  We've got the fluoride-free toothpaste that's about to sell out again.
[02:56:14.898 --> 02:56:17.159]  We've got the great probiotic fiber.
[02:56:17.179 --> 02:56:18.901]  We've got Supermelt Vitality, 25% off.
[02:56:19.722 --> 02:56:21.323]  We've got so much more.
[02:56:21.343 --> 02:56:25.186]  50% off the other side of the probiotics equation.
[02:56:25.286 --> 02:56:27.909]  Doesn't just knock out the bad bacteria, the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:56:28.249 --> 02:56:28.649]  Amazing.
[02:56:28.890 --> 02:56:29.870]  MycoZX Plus.
[02:56:29.930 --> 02:56:35.875]  Now, lower price and stronger, as I signed a year contract and went with the top organic manufacturer in the country.
[02:56:36.576 --> 02:56:37.617]  And it's already got reviews.

[02:56:57.567 --> 02:56:59.207]  You have stood against the globalists.
[02:56:59.227 --> 02:57:00.408]  Your will has been incredible.
[02:57:00.748 --> 02:57:01.729]  And you've seen ours tested.
[02:57:02.827 --> 02:57:08.731]  But the globalists are so fake now, stuff they put out 10 years ago against somebody would destroy them, even if it was fake.
[02:57:08.812 --> 02:57:17.958]  Now, they make up the most outlandish stuff every week about us, and it just blows up in their face because of you.
[02:57:18.419 --> 02:57:20.280]  So don't ever call again and thank me.
[02:57:21.541 --> 02:57:22.322]  Brothers and sisters.
[02:57:23.855 --> 02:57:25.256]  Everyone of you is the reason we're here.
[02:57:25.356 --> 02:57:26.797]  You are the reason we can stand.
[02:57:27.217 --> 02:57:29.718]  This crew, everybody here, this is history happening.
[02:57:29.998 --> 02:57:34.120]  Fourth Hour straight ahead with Laura Loomer, John Ravaport and more.
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:37.122]  Spread the live links on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[02:57:37.182 --> 02:57:39.323]  Personally, hand out cards with InfoWars on it.
[02:57:39.523 --> 02:57:43.105]  Whatever you do, realize they're trying to shut this down because it will destroy them.
[02:57:44.986 --> 02:57:51.249]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[02:58:48.063 --> 02:58:49.383]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:49.863 --> 02:59:01.408]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:02.089 --> 02:59:07.551]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:59:07.971 --> 02:59:17.259]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:59:17.279 --> 02:59:22.122]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:22.643 --> 02:59:24.944]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:59:25.285 --> 02:59:26.626]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:27.026 --> 02:59:31.910]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:59:32.130 --> 02:59:36.633]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:36.733 --> 02:59:38.874]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:39.414 --> 02:59:44.317]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:59:47.059 --> 02:59:53.022]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:53.042 --> 03:00:00.847]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[03:00:08.254 --> 03:00:10.055]  He never gives up.
[03:00:10.495 --> 03:00:12.156]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.536 --> 03:00:15.058]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:00:15.658 --> 03:00:16.599]  Worldwide.
[03:00:16.699 --> 03:00:20.241]  Well, Drudge Report came through again.
[03:00:24.989 --> 03:00:38.736]  Citigroup imposes restrictions on client gun sales, and just like we talked to Kit Cope of the great folks at SpikesTactical.com, within 10 minutes of drudge linking, they took the fake ban off, even though they admitted it was on purpose in Bloomberg.
[03:00:39.576 --> 03:00:45.419]  They fear drudge because it's the number one site in the world, not just news site, it's like number two total traffic, but it's number one in the world.
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:51.863]  But, the president looks at it, I'm told, neurotically, and not in a bad way, just
[03:00:53.001 --> 03:00:54.584]  I mean, I only look at it like 20 times a day.
[03:00:54.604 --> 03:00:57.148]  I think the president every five minutes.
[03:00:57.248 --> 03:00:58.551]  Laura Loomer joins us.
[03:01:00.033 --> 03:01:02.017]  Big article up at Dangerous.com.
[03:01:04.022 --> 03:01:05.823]  By the way, Milo's been wanting to come work here and stuff.
[03:01:05.883 --> 03:01:09.384]  I'm just dealing with all the lawsuits and trying to get the money to do that stuff.
[03:01:09.865 --> 03:01:12.406]  It's all up to you, the listeners, whether I can get Milo or Laura Loomer in here.
[03:01:12.446 --> 03:01:13.366]  I'm trying to make the decisions.
[03:01:13.386 --> 03:01:15.467]  They're just hammering the hell out of us here.
[03:01:15.747 --> 03:01:16.387]  I'm not bitching.
[03:01:16.427 --> 03:01:17.748]  I'm just throwing that out to everybody.
[03:01:18.388 --> 03:01:20.049]  But Laura's a great investigative journalist.
[03:01:20.109 --> 03:01:24.431]  She leaked audio reveals Broward County teachers planning to illegally storm the White House.
[03:01:25.331 --> 03:01:26.252]  That's up on our Twitter.
[03:01:26.312 --> 03:01:27.392]  It's up at Dangerous.com.
[03:01:27.412 --> 03:01:29.433]  We post the article at InfoWars.com.
[03:01:29.453 --> 03:01:30.734]  So I appreciate her coming on with us.
[03:01:30.754 --> 03:01:33.875]  We got about an hour behind because of Trump and his big announcements on China and more.
[03:01:34.275 --> 03:01:37.677]  But I mean, there's no doubt we're in the middle of an epic time.
[03:01:37.717 --> 03:01:39.778]  This is edge of your seat stuff, Laura.
[03:01:40.238 --> 03:01:46.961]  And here's the left staging town halls, not saying they're crisis actors, but getting kids that are anti-gun to be the spokespersons.
[03:01:47.381 --> 03:01:48.222]  That's now come out.
[03:01:49.142 --> 03:01:53.084]  And now this, we've got the audio coming up in the next segment, but tell folks about this.
[03:01:54.329 --> 03:02:04.340]  Yeah, so I conducted a hidden audio sting on the Parkland organizers here in Florida, because as you know, today they're departing for D.C.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:10.827]  for their really big March for Our Lives, which is going to be a three or four day, you know, palooza of
[03:02:11.427 --> 03:02:19.214]  Liberals just gathering together in DC to protest Trump and protest the NRA and rally to take away our guns.
[03:02:19.715 --> 03:02:30.504]  And so they held this meeting and a representative for the Giffords Foundation, who is also a teacher in Broward County, was caught on camera saying, well on audio, saying a lot of really disturbing things.
[03:02:30.524 --> 03:02:34.328]  Telling the students to make sure they have their talking points ready so that they get as much
[03:02:34.668 --> 03:02:35.229]  We're good to go.
[03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:55.852]  And then told the press who are in the room not to listen.
[03:02:56.212 --> 03:02:59.233]  But they don't even have the proper permits to have a march.
[03:02:59.273 --> 03:03:02.195]  You have to have permits in order to have a march on Capitol Hill.
[03:03:02.655 --> 03:03:13.261]  And the Giffords Foundation, which is tied to Gabby Giffords, you know, the congresswoman who was shot in the head in Arizona and now, you know, promotes gun control, failed to acquire proper permitting.
[03:03:13.301 --> 03:03:16.583]  So they're having a rally and this teacher literally
[03:03:17.563 --> 03:03:19.004]  Let's talk about this, because...
[03:03:34.161 --> 03:03:46.170]  Jewish people, I mean, it's a very diverse group, and anybody trying to say it's one thing or the other is just pure bull, but the left's always calling anybody conservative or libertarian anti-Semitic, including people that are pro-Israel, like myself, with no proof.
[03:03:46.530 --> 03:03:48.592]  They just have Tom Brokaw say it, so I gotta sue him.
[03:03:49.372 --> 03:03:51.154]  And then, any time I gotta run leftist,
[03:03:52.034 --> 03:03:58.179]  It is just Jew this, Jew that, Bash Jews, Soros hates Jews, salt-loathing Jew, wants to overthrow Israel.
[03:03:58.479 --> 03:04:01.421]  That's right, you've got the audio here, it's on the articles, it's a lot of it.
[03:04:02.342 --> 03:04:06.685]  Shooting their mouths off about Jews, Linda Saucer leads the Women's March.
[03:04:06.765 --> 03:04:08.286]  I mean, these people are crazy!
[03:04:09.707 --> 03:04:22.097]  Yeah, and it's also really concerning because when I confronted this teacher and this representative and I called her out and I said, why are you telling students, you know, young minors that Jews control politicians in Washington?
[03:04:22.137 --> 03:04:23.258]  Are you an anti-Semite?
[03:04:23.598 --> 03:04:25.299]  And she goes, oh, I was just kidding.
[03:04:25.599 --> 03:04:32.325]  Well, if I were to make a joke and, you know, about black people and use the N-word, would I be able to- It's not a joke!
[03:04:32.445 --> 03:04:33.285]  I was just kidding.
[03:04:33.305 --> 03:04:34.246]  I was just kidding.
[03:04:34.266 --> 03:04:35.147]  I was just kidding.
[03:04:35.807 --> 03:04:37.028]  Just disregard what I said.
[03:04:37.109 --> 03:04:37.809]  I was just kidding.
[03:04:37.869 --> 03:04:41.072]  No, I mean, people would cry me, especially... Well, exactly.
[03:04:41.092 --> 03:04:41.793]  Stay there, Laura Loomer.
[03:04:41.933 --> 03:04:43.274]  I'm just saying it's bizarre.
[03:04:44.075 --> 03:04:47.758]  The only time I ever heard about Jewish cabals and stuff is going and covering leftist events.
[03:04:48.359 --> 03:04:52.002]  And then the very left that's doing all this is attacking me.
[03:04:52.082 --> 03:04:53.363]  I mean, they are crazy people.
[03:04:53.403 --> 03:04:53.864]  We'll be back.
[03:05:01.055 --> 03:05:04.137]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:04.177 --> 03:05:04.697]  You're on the air.
[03:05:04.717 --> 03:05:05.878]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:05.898 --> 03:05:06.739]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:06.959 --> 03:05:07.579]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:07.859 --> 03:05:08.220]  Good, man.
[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:09.060]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:09.681]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:09.781 --> 03:05:14.004]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:14.084 --> 03:05:20.768]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:20.788 --> 03:05:22.609]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:05:22.709 --> 03:05:28.873]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:30.014 --> 03:05:31.135]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:31.175 --> 03:05:33.636]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:05:33.676 --> 03:05:35.197]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:35.577 --> 03:05:37.178]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:37.638 --> 03:05:38.379]  And exactly.
[03:05:38.399 --> 03:05:42.621]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:42.981 --> 03:05:43.261]  Boom!
[03:05:43.401 --> 03:05:46.243]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:46.283 --> 03:05:46.823]  It's amazing.
[03:05:46.863 --> 03:05:48.184]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:05:48.244 --> 03:05:51.106]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:06.391 --> 03:06:10.535]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:11.236 --> 03:06:12.757]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:28.283 --> 03:06:31.084]  All right, Laura Loomer is a prolific investigative journalist.
[03:06:31.104 --> 03:06:38.985]  She helped with others expose the Saudi Arabian connection as part of that civil war that was going on before Trump got them to roll over in Vegas.
[03:06:39.005 --> 03:06:40.646]  We now have footage on Infowars.com.
[03:06:41.146 --> 03:06:44.147]  This surveillance video shows alleged Vegas gunman there days before.
[03:06:45.147 --> 03:06:48.568]  The government had said he was there, but our law enforcement sources said he was there days before.
[03:06:48.588 --> 03:06:50.008]  They told us he'd been in the Middle East.
[03:06:50.888 --> 03:06:53.089]  They told us it was part of a Saudi Civil War.
[03:06:53.129 --> 03:06:53.789]  That all came out.
[03:06:53.829 --> 03:06:56.889]  Laura Limmer got the receipts, all of it, to help corroborate all that.
[03:06:56.929 --> 03:06:58.290]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:58.690 --> 03:07:02.731]  But there's a new story at Dangerous.com and at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:03.411 --> 03:07:07.632]  Leaked audio reveals Broward County teachers planning to illegally storm the White House.
[03:07:08.432 --> 03:07:11.713]  And so we're going to play a clip of this, but all that's one thing.
[03:07:11.993 --> 03:07:13.153]  That's bad enough, but it's...
[03:07:14.932 --> 03:07:17.614]  I'm not bashing northerners, because a lot of great people live up north.
[03:07:18.235 --> 03:07:25.321]  I never heard people use the n-word until I went and did rallies and stuff like 15 years ago in New York, and I didn't hear a lot of it.
[03:07:26.022 --> 03:07:27.002]  It was more like a joke.
[03:07:27.203 --> 03:07:29.044]  Oh, you're this Italian name.
[03:07:29.064 --> 03:07:30.145]  You're this Irish name.
[03:07:30.485 --> 03:07:31.366]  You're this black name.
[03:07:31.386 --> 03:07:35.170]  And I'd be sitting there at a table with a black guy and an Irish guy calling each other names.
[03:07:36.170 --> 03:07:37.311]  And I mean, down here in Texas,
[03:07:38.504 --> 03:07:39.665]  I never used those terms.
[03:07:39.725 --> 03:07:42.348]  My dad would have kicked my ass.
[03:07:43.149 --> 03:07:49.835]  I mean, we were not racist because we were Christians and we didn't look down on people and we were going to bring up society.
[03:07:50.256 --> 03:07:56.442]  And my grandma would, you know, have, I mean, on Thanksgiving and on Christmas, it'd be like 15 old black ladies bringing us pie.
[03:07:56.922 --> 03:07:58.084]  I didn't know why till later.
[03:07:59.349 --> 03:08:05.475]  I want to get a little stories about it, but my grandpa was one of the first Republicans to run as an Eisenhower Republican, and it was all pretty crazy.
[03:08:05.495 --> 03:08:06.516]  I remember being in the grocery store.
[03:08:06.536 --> 03:08:07.397]  I was like 10 years old.
[03:08:07.737 --> 03:08:13.123]  My grandma visiting her in the summer, and somebody walked over and said, F-U-U-N, word lover, some KKK guy.
[03:08:13.143 --> 03:08:15.886]  She just bowed up to him and said, get out of my face, you white trash.
[03:08:19.306 --> 03:08:37.075]  My issue is, the Democrats, the left, I mean, these people are race-obsessed, and exactly, and I've interviewed Louis Farrakhan, and I tried to bring people together, I'm not even gonna attack him, but Obama meets with him, when he gives speeches, saying all this stuff, and that's all ignored, but then I don't say any of that, and I get attacked.
[03:08:37.095 --> 03:08:38.876]  So Laura, I'm taking up your time here, and I apologize.
[03:08:39.857 --> 03:08:41.417]  Let's get into what happened and what went on.
[03:08:41.437 --> 03:08:47.921]  It's just crazy to see the Democrats, who lost the first Civil War, they lose the second one,
[03:08:48.781 --> 03:08:52.585]  Trying to rebrand themselves, but it's only because of people's ignorance.
[03:08:53.506 --> 03:08:54.907]  But please continue.
[03:08:55.608 --> 03:08:56.709]  Tell us about this Broward County.
[03:08:56.929 --> 03:08:58.650]  You got the video, but who she is.
[03:08:58.670 --> 03:09:02.754]  Because this shows they're organizing the students, which we knew they were doing day one.
[03:09:03.074 --> 03:09:08.079]  But then they attack us and say it's a fake shooting or they're all actors if we just say they're organizing them.
[03:09:08.379 --> 03:09:11.082]  No, we're saying they're picking who they want to give voices.
[03:09:11.322 --> 03:09:13.945]  It's in the news today that a conservative student was banned from CNN.
[03:09:15.171 --> 03:09:30.398]  Exactly, and a lot of conservatives, I mean, I received a 30-day ban on Facebook, you received strikes on your YouTube channel, simply because we pointed out the fact that the liberal media and these organizers tied to left-wing politicians, like the Giffords Foundation is, are giving these students scripts.
[03:09:30.718 --> 03:09:35.159]  And long behold, what does this organizer and this Broward County teacher say during this meeting?
[03:09:36.059 --> 03:09:48.223]  You guys, this is really like secret information, but make sure you guys have your talking points ready and that your camera ready for the legislators and the media and the reporters and CNN and Nancy Pelosi.
[03:09:48.263 --> 03:09:51.163]  They're having a secret meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
[03:09:51.203 --> 03:09:54.224]  Joe Biden just said he wants to beat the hell out of Donald Trump.
[03:09:54.264 --> 03:09:56.825]  I thought this was supposed to be an anti-violence march, you know?
[03:09:57.561 --> 03:10:04.468]  Uh, it's all so hypocritical and everything that the conservatives predicted, uh, is literally happening and it's caught on this audio.
[03:10:04.528 --> 03:10:07.151]  Another thing that's extremely disturbing is Southwest Airlines.
[03:10:07.612 --> 03:10:14.759]  Uh, this organizer said that Southwest Airlines donated, uh, 200 plus seats for the student protesters to travel to DC.
[03:10:15.039 --> 03:10:17.402]  Well, I called Southwest Airlines and
[03:10:18.368 --> 03:10:22.371]  I say, hey, are you guys basically taking an anti-Trump, anti-gun position?
[03:10:22.431 --> 03:10:24.593]  Is it true that you guys have donated all these seats?
[03:10:24.913 --> 03:10:27.475]  And the representative said, no, no, no, that's not true.
[03:10:27.555 --> 03:10:30.277]  And I recorded the phone calls so your viewers can hear that too.
[03:10:30.677 --> 03:10:35.741]  But the Giffords Foundation, I've exclusively obtained their official itinerary for the march.
[03:10:36.101 --> 03:10:45.428]  And all of the students and the people participating in this march are traveling on Southwest Airlines flights, which are flying out of Fort Lauderdale Airport this afternoon.
[03:10:45.709 --> 03:10:46.930]  Really, as we speak right now.
[03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:55.757]  I can send you that itinerary so you can see it for yourself, but clearly either one, Southwest Airlines is lying, or two, the Liberals and the Democrats.
[03:10:55.797 --> 03:10:56.317]  Sure, sure.
[03:10:56.337 --> 03:10:59.139]  Well, I want to play this clip, and there's a whole bunch of it.
[03:10:59.159 --> 03:11:01.921]  This is just a few minutes of it, but again.
[03:11:02.901 --> 03:11:10.345]  The left is like, kill all the white people, kill all the Jews, kill all the gentrifiers, and it's always weird white people.
[03:11:11.406 --> 03:11:15.108]  I'm just saying who it is, mainly women, you know, in Huffington Post, you name it, leading it.
[03:11:16.048 --> 03:11:20.991]  And it's like, and I'm not just patronizing, most minorities I know are actually smart, hardworking people.
[03:11:21.371 --> 03:11:22.652]  They're not involved in all this.
[03:11:23.292 --> 03:11:25.733]  So it's a bunch of whacked out leftists leading this, Laura.
[03:11:26.233 --> 03:11:28.915]  I don't see where they think it's going, because I don't think it's working.
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:30.821]  Well, exactly.
[03:11:30.841 --> 03:11:41.470]  And then when I asked the teacher, I said, do you think it's really appropriate for you to be like, you know, abusing taxpayer funded resources to print liberal propaganda and encourage your students to break the law?
[03:11:41.851 --> 03:11:47.716]  And she literally said, and I have a recording of this, I have no problem with civil disobedience.
[03:11:47.936 --> 03:11:56.824]  All right, so I guess she has no problem with students getting arrested for violently protesting the president, students skipping class, and her committing fraud essentially.
[03:11:56.864 --> 03:12:03.691]  This woman, Debbie Miller, in which she jokingly tells the audience that she was printing copies of this
[03:12:04.091 --> 03:12:09.755]  Let's be clear.
[03:12:12.057 --> 03:12:18.901]  Civil disobedience is in an area like a lunch counter you won't let a black lady get lunch or a black lady's got to go back to the bus.
[03:12:19.302 --> 03:12:21.103]  That's not really breaking a real law.
[03:12:21.403 --> 03:12:25.046]  But when you go out and hit somebody in the head with a bike lock or you say Jews are the enemy,
[03:12:25.746 --> 03:12:33.975]  You have that speech, but as a teacher, you need to be exposed for what you did, especially when you're the people projecting that onto us.
[03:12:34.015 --> 03:12:34.755]  Let's play a clip.
[03:12:35.794 --> 03:12:44.257]  From the larger clip of this radicalization of the students the day after they said that the Women's March funded by Soros was funding it.
[03:12:44.657 --> 03:12:46.337]  I pointed that out, they banned our YouTube.
[03:12:46.717 --> 03:13:00.002]  So again, this is Democrat Party, this is funded, it's now in the news, it's being funded by the Democrats, and here is what they're, all over the country, bringing young people in, saying you're important, putting them in hotels, getting them dinner, and teaching them this.
[03:13:00.122 --> 03:13:00.482]  Here it is.
[03:13:02.769 --> 03:13:06.033]  The other thing is, and again, this is super off the record.
[03:13:06.173 --> 03:13:07.494]  So, here's what happened.
[03:13:08.055 --> 03:13:09.316]  It was supposed to be a march.
[03:13:10.698 --> 03:13:15.984]  And then, shockingly, they wouldn't give permits for the march.
[03:13:17.425 --> 03:13:19.407]  So the march became a rally.
[03:13:20.288 --> 03:13:22.210]  Now, I've heard rumors from
[03:13:25.601 --> 03:13:27.042]  Kids.
[03:13:27.422 --> 03:13:36.588]  That, since the rally is right on Pennsylvania Avenue and the White House is like a 20 minute walk up the street, that that might happen.
[03:13:37.648 --> 03:13:49.876]  So it's conceivable that we could leave at the end of the rally and walk to the White House where we rally some more and hold up our signs and say our peace and
[03:13:56.507 --> 03:14:01.512]  So, she keeps saying, the kids tell me, she's there organizing it, Democratic funding, all this stuff.
[03:14:01.912 --> 03:14:07.357]  And the point is, is that they want to get rid of our free speech online, while they're setting this all up in the real world.
[03:14:07.818 --> 03:14:09.500]  And it just shows how cryptic it is.
[03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:14.905]  Now they've traumatized these young people into Stockholm Syndrome, and they're now trying to enslave them.
[03:14:16.155 --> 03:14:23.418]  Well, and also it's really concerning, as she says, and then when we're done raising hell and protesting Trump, we're gonna go to the NEA building and have hot chocolate!
[03:14:23.458 --> 03:14:23.918]  Woo!
[03:14:24.298 --> 03:14:27.600]  The NEA building, the National Education Association.
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:37.003]  So you mean to tell me that a federal organization which is supposed to oversee the education of American youth is now taking an anti-Trump liberal position?
[03:14:37.364 --> 03:14:45.507]  I mean, God, if these people are literally protesting Trump and then getting funds or getting support from the NEA, this is a full-blown information war.
[03:14:48.288 --> 03:14:50.510]  It's a Federal Elections Commission violation.
[03:14:51.450 --> 03:14:52.031]  It's everything.
[03:14:52.911 --> 03:14:57.354]  And it's time for Trump to move against this, because this is using taxpayer money.
[03:14:57.394 --> 03:14:58.375]  Laura Loomer, great job.
[03:14:58.415 --> 03:15:02.217]  The full article is at obviouslydangerous.com, infowars.com.
[03:15:02.877 --> 03:15:05.419]  Your new site is lauraloomer.us.
[03:15:05.439 --> 03:15:07.700]  Everybody should follow you at Twitter at Laura Loomer.
[03:15:08.361 --> 03:15:08.901]  Great job.
[03:15:08.921 --> 03:15:10.082]  30-second final comment.
[03:15:11.478 --> 03:15:19.026]  I would just really also encourage all of your viewers to tweet at Southwest Airlines today and ask them, are they, in fact, bankrolling these students to go?
[03:15:19.046 --> 03:15:22.610]  I mean, if so, then they're taking a position against half of America.
[03:15:22.871 --> 03:15:29.678]  And I also think that people should contact the Broward County School officials and, you know, that there should be a federal complaint filed.
[03:15:30.839 --> 03:15:31.840]  Absolutely, folks.
[03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:33.001]  It's time to take action.
[03:15:33.061 --> 03:15:35.984]  And again, Southwest is crap, but it's got direct flights.
[03:15:36.044 --> 03:15:36.404]  I use it.
[03:15:36.925 --> 03:15:39.267]  If they're anti-gun in doing this, I'm done with Southwest.
[03:15:39.587 --> 03:15:41.009]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much.
[03:15:41.049 --> 03:15:41.669]  Amazing job.
[03:15:41.689 --> 03:15:42.770]  Thank you.
[03:15:43.211 --> 03:15:43.751]  We'll be back.
[03:15:44.572 --> 03:15:45.793]  It was just about an hour and a half ago.
[03:15:46.334 --> 03:15:47.815]  Owen Schroyer, the City Council.
[03:15:47.895 --> 03:15:48.836]  It's dramatic footage.
[03:15:49.176 --> 03:15:52.419]  It's going to premiere here from the ATX on the other side of this break.
[03:15:52.439 --> 03:15:52.820]  Stay with us.
[03:15:57.205 --> 03:15:59.608]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewald.
[03:16:00.349 --> 03:16:02.451]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[03:16:02.671 --> 03:16:04.894]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[03:16:05.434 --> 03:16:11.521]  And we set out with beta-glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[03:16:11.561 --> 03:16:15.926]  We can even make claims about what this does to
[03:16:16.787 --> 03:16:22.770]  Bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:25.611]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[03:16:25.671 --> 03:16:30.633]  Wellmune is patented and documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[03:16:31.694 --> 03:16:32.514]  Then you got the Ancient.
[03:16:32.814 --> 03:16:36.796]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[03:16:59.878 --> 03:17:02.659]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing.
[03:17:02.819 --> 03:17:05.800]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle.
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:07.280]  And a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:11.942]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[03:17:12.542 --> 03:17:18.884]  They said on average about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:17:20.327 --> 03:17:42.806]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered to actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things, and I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records, and then you get a sleep unlike other systems, I mean,
[03:17:43.911 --> 03:17:50.054]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:17:50.074 --> 03:17:51.955]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:17:51.975 --> 03:17:53.856]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:17:53.876 --> 03:17:56.797]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[03:17:58.078 --> 03:17:59.559]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:18:00.079 --> 03:18:01.680]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:18:01.700 --> 03:18:03.701]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:18:04.918 --> 03:18:08.059]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:18:08.079 --> 03:18:08.959]  This is insane.
[03:18:09.380 --> 03:18:10.340]  Wow, it's incredible.
[03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:12.421]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[03:18:12.541 --> 03:18:13.761]  Wow, this is incredible.
[03:18:14.061 --> 03:18:15.142]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[03:18:15.182 --> 03:18:20.143]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[03:18:20.243 --> 03:18:21.184]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[03:18:21.844 --> 03:18:22.986]  And they're all game changers.
[03:18:23.026 --> 03:18:27.833]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[03:18:28.454 --> 03:18:32.099]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[03:18:36.604 --> 03:18:41.926]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them going, we want to see it, it must be fake.
[03:18:41.946 --> 03:18:44.207]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[03:18:45.488 --> 03:18:49.330]  So they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[03:18:49.350 --> 03:18:53.351]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it.
[03:18:53.391 --> 03:18:59.154]  California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[03:18:59.474 --> 03:19:05.501]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[03:19:05.801 --> 03:19:13.689]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard, but if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[03:19:14.010 --> 03:19:16.612]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[03:19:17.293 --> 03:19:20.135]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[03:19:20.275 --> 03:19:20.996]  It's just insane.
[03:19:21.016 --> 03:19:24.578]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[03:19:24.598 --> 03:19:27.000]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:27.540 --> 03:19:31.643]  But thank you for committing to get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:19:31.663 --> 03:19:34.645]  Because it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:19:34.665 --> 03:19:37.707]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[03:19:38.347 --> 03:19:41.470]  And you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:19:41.490 --> 03:19:44.612]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:19:44.932 --> 03:19:46.253]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:19:48.208 --> 03:19:49.809]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:49.829 --> 03:19:51.529]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.757 --> 03:20:19.878]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:20.379 --> 03:20:25.622]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:20:27.504 --> 03:20:33.407]  You know, I've sworn an oath publicly to the Bill of Rights and Constitution because I believe in the idea of America and the Renaissance.
[03:20:34.708 --> 03:20:36.710]  And a lot of my ancestors have done it as well.
[03:20:36.730 --> 03:20:37.750]  A lot of my family has.
[03:20:38.651 --> 03:20:41.413]  And they did a lot of bad things because of their oath.
[03:20:41.453 --> 03:20:43.614]  But you know, I can sit back and look at my 23 years on air
[03:20:45.382 --> 03:20:47.963]  And tell you that I'm not as good as some of my ancestors.
[03:20:48.543 --> 03:20:55.406]  I just in the modern age had a chance with telecommunications and the internet to do things a little bit purer my way.
[03:20:56.486 --> 03:20:59.427]  And I think what my ancestors would have done if they had what we have today.
[03:21:01.148 --> 03:21:01.648]  It's amazing.
[03:21:02.709 --> 03:21:04.169]  We're at a crossroads.
[03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:07.730]  And the world's changing.
[03:21:09.451 --> 03:21:12.612]  And it's not about what we do personally or what we gain personally.
[03:21:12.972 --> 03:21:14.273]  It's about how we change the world.
[03:21:15.475 --> 03:21:18.216]  On my mom's side of the family, not bragging, it's just an interesting story.
[03:21:18.856 --> 03:21:31.038]  On the heir's side, folks that raised Colonel Travis's son, launched the Texas Revolution, met with President Jackson to covertly fund things after they'd already been in Texas for 10 years.
[03:21:34.019 --> 03:21:35.479]  He sold everything he had in New York.
[03:21:35.519 --> 03:21:38.100]  He was one of the richest men in New York.
[03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:40.880]  It was self-made.
[03:21:42.521 --> 03:21:44.401]  Real estate, slaughterhouses, you name it.
[03:21:45.782 --> 03:21:56.588]  And he funded a ship of Bibles and several other ships to get Protestant preachers into Galveston to launch the operation that a decade later would create Texas.
[03:21:57.448 --> 03:22:07.934]  Now, he financially ended up dying at some farmhouse in Central Texas, but he died happy because he and then his son and others launched Texas.
[03:22:09.275 --> 03:22:10.255]  And that's what it's all about.
[03:22:10.875 --> 03:22:22.017]  Would you rather die some super rich man with a bunch of land in New York City or die being, in the history book, the little busy beaver creating the state?
[03:22:23.198 --> 03:22:23.818]  I'm proud of that.
[03:22:25.438 --> 03:22:26.838]  And that's where we sit right now.
[03:22:26.918 --> 03:22:29.759]  It's not about us right now, it's about the long game.
[03:22:30.299 --> 03:22:32.740]  Because we live, I live because of all those people.
[03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:34.800]  Those men and women that were tough as nails.
[03:22:37.932 --> 03:22:39.375]  Their commitment's so strong.
[03:22:40.517 --> 03:22:41.098]  Iron will.
[03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:42.781]  Unstoppable.
[03:22:44.665 --> 03:22:46.147]  It's that strength the enemy hates.
[03:22:46.688 --> 03:22:47.350]  It's the will!
[03:22:48.510 --> 03:22:50.811]  So no matter what happens, never back down.
[03:22:51.552 --> 03:22:54.733]  And by the way, I know that the threat's going to become much greater.
[03:22:55.293 --> 03:22:56.794]  I haven't even been put on pressure yet.
[03:22:57.535 --> 03:23:03.638]  I get tears in my eyes because God is so strong and God is so great and God is so good.
[03:23:03.978 --> 03:23:10.321]  And I look at people that don't know what side to be on and I get upset for them not choosing God right away.
[03:23:10.341 --> 03:23:13.583]  Now let me get to this big new story.
[03:23:18.072 --> 03:23:21.074]  The headline is, Antifa.
[03:23:22.634 --> 03:23:27.897]  The headline is, Armed Antifa Block Entrance to the Austin City Council.
[03:23:29.078 --> 03:23:30.699]  That's what Owen Schroeder brought up to him.
[03:23:31.259 --> 03:23:43.326]  Because just a month ago, he tried to go down to a vigil for Kate Steinle, murder by an illegal alien, and the jury let them off.
[03:23:44.646 --> 03:23:47.088]  Let the individual off that killed her as a virtue signal.
[03:23:48.348 --> 03:23:54.195]  And he went down to a park by the Capitol and there's 10 minutes of video where they come over with their guns live.
[03:23:54.215 --> 03:23:55.757]  It's a live stream and say, are you scared?
[03:23:56.197 --> 03:23:56.918]  We're going to hurt you.
[03:23:57.079 --> 03:23:57.940]  You're not allowed to go.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.322]  And then hit him with clubs that won't let him in.
[03:24:00.523 --> 03:24:01.524]  And they say, you're shaking.
[03:24:02.165 --> 03:24:04.067]  Well, yeah, he's shaking because he's about to kick their ass.
[03:24:06.209 --> 03:24:07.171]  He says, yeah, I'm scared.
[03:24:09.431 --> 03:24:14.575]  You got guns, you're telling me I can't come in here, and they follow him all around the park and won't let him in, and they beat up other people.
[03:24:14.936 --> 03:24:21.401]  So, Owen Schroer went down to city council and he said, what would it be like if armed men out here kept people from coming into this meeting?
[03:24:21.621 --> 03:24:22.942]  Because that's what this is!
[03:24:23.483 --> 03:24:27.486]  Because if they can block you to the park and the police let it happen, the police are right behind you.
[03:24:27.927 --> 03:24:30.489]  Then they could block you anywhere.
[03:24:30.509 --> 03:24:32.671]  And by the way, those cops are scared of some guys with guns.
[03:24:32.931 --> 03:24:33.812]  They shouldn't be cops.
[03:24:36.263 --> 03:24:38.305]  Mass and even try to fight Infowars reporter.
[03:24:38.985 --> 03:24:42.148]  Now let's go ahead and go to what just happened a few hours ago.
[03:24:42.168 --> 03:24:45.150]  Owen's coming up in 35 minutes with the war room.
[03:24:45.611 --> 03:24:46.631]  But this is what happened.
[03:24:46.651 --> 03:24:48.593]  This has just been on local cable.
[03:24:49.053 --> 03:24:52.376]  This is not aired yet on the internet or radio or TV.
[03:24:52.816 --> 03:24:54.538]  Here is Owen illustrating it.
[03:24:57.881 --> 03:25:00.523]  Alright, well I'm going to start by asking the council a question.
[03:25:00.583 --> 03:25:06.266]  Given everything that's happened in the month of March with the bombings and the police officers saying, if you see anything suspicious, say something.
[03:25:06.807 --> 03:25:12.691]  I think we would all agree that masked men walking around with firearms is something suspicious.
[03:25:12.711 --> 03:25:16.053]  Now I'm going to play this video for the council to review.
[03:25:18.547 --> 03:25:20.668]  That illustrates that exact thing happening.
[03:25:20.748 --> 03:25:26.532]  Now, I am a firm believer in the First Amendment right, so an individual has the right to walk around with their face covered.
[03:25:27.473 --> 03:25:29.114]  I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment right.
[03:25:29.614 --> 03:25:33.837]  I believe in constitutional carriage, so you can carry a rifle or whatever firearm you want with you.
[03:25:34.357 --> 03:25:34.738]  However,
[03:25:35.778 --> 03:25:36.518]  According to U.S.
[03:25:36.558 --> 03:26:03.227]  Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 13, Subsection 241, Conspiracy Against Rights states, if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any state, territory, commonwealth, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised them the same, or two or more persons go in disguise or on the premises
[03:26:03.487 --> 03:26:07.291]  Well, on December 10th, the video you're witnessing right now, I went to a memorial march for a deceased victim.
[03:26:21.207 --> 03:26:22.288]  Of a violent crime.
[03:26:22.769 --> 03:26:31.878]  And I was met, as you can see in these pictures, by masked men with arms on their triggers of rifles, battering clubs, etc.
[03:26:32.439 --> 03:26:37.303]  Here you can see this man has his finger on the trigger, keeping me from going to a park
[03:26:38.447 --> 03:26:45.589]  A memorial, here's them, with shields and clubs blocking the entrance from a park for a dead person's memorial.
[03:26:45.629 --> 03:26:50.130]  Now, if that doesn't violate the code, I don't know what does.
[03:26:50.810 --> 03:27:01.312]  And I find it timely that we sit here today with you all discussing getting more funding for police, but I did not hear one person make a suggestion to keep violent criminals off the streets.
[03:27:01.932 --> 03:27:13.381]  Well, maybe if we looked into sanctuary city laws and keeping masked men with guns off the streets, we wouldn't have to have a hundred police officers out there every time somebody wants to have a march, which is every weekend.
[03:27:14.622 --> 03:27:18.445]  Now, I'll just say this in closing and provide an illustration for you.
[03:27:23.389 --> 03:27:25.031]  He puts a mask and hat on Antifa.
[03:27:25.051 --> 03:27:29.054]  Except he doesn't look like a meth head, so he doesn't really wear it well.
[03:27:30.859 --> 03:27:38.827]  If I was outside, holding a rifle, keeping people from getting into this city council to state their claim, do you think I should be arrested?
[03:27:39.568 --> 03:27:43.372]  I think everybody here would agree, yes, that should be an arrest.
[03:27:43.732 --> 03:27:44.352]  Absolutely.
[03:27:44.793 --> 03:27:49.317]  But for some reason, and I'm not blaming the APD, because I think they're good men and women.
[03:27:49.357 --> 03:27:51.460]  Most of my experiences with them have been positive.
[03:27:52.180 --> 03:28:06.728]  But if we're not going to arrest armed individuals with masks, brandishing weapons, intimidating people from their free speech, a clear violation of the law, I just want to know why, and I want to know if this city council thinks that that's the type of city that we should live in.
[03:28:06.948 --> 03:28:07.609]  Thank you for your time.
[03:28:07.629 --> 03:28:08.289]  Thank you.
[03:28:09.430 --> 03:28:09.730]  Mayor.
[03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:10.490]  Miss, yes?
[03:28:11.070 --> 03:28:14.532]  If he would provide us with a link, because I couldn't see that.
[03:28:15.293 --> 03:28:16.373]  Absolutely, I'd be happy to.
[03:28:16.894 --> 03:28:17.254]  Thank you.
[03:28:19.298 --> 03:28:22.722]  Owen Schroyer, we're looking for a few good men and women here at InfoWars.
[03:28:26.867 --> 03:28:27.247]  God.
[03:28:28.549 --> 03:28:31.612]  It's an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, but we're here for this time.
[03:28:32.413 --> 03:28:33.835]  We're here for this confrontation.
[03:28:35.217 --> 03:28:37.800]  And as long as we show up, we will win.
[03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:40.652]  Thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[03:28:41.293 --> 03:28:42.154]  Thanks to Jon Rappaport.
[03:28:42.174 --> 03:28:43.496]  Let me take 30 minutes of his hour.
[03:28:44.137 --> 03:28:47.682]  The founder of nomorefakenews.com is straight ahead on the other side.
[03:28:48.323 --> 03:28:50.766]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:28:51.227 --> 03:28:51.968]  Please spread the links.
[03:28:52.048 --> 03:28:53.050]  You are the resistance.
[03:28:58.018 --> 03:28:59.419]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[03:28:59.459 --> 03:29:00.900]  Victor, you're calling.
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:01.320]  Go ahead.
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:02.861]  Yes, hi Alex.
[03:29:02.981 --> 03:29:09.184]  First, I just want to mention if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[03:29:09.385 --> 03:29:13.367]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[03:29:13.607 --> 03:29:15.048]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[03:29:15.428 --> 03:29:22.312]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[03:29:22.632 --> 03:29:25.274]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[03:29:25.334 --> 03:29:28.755]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[03:29:29.055 --> 03:29:30.636]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[03:29:30.676 --> 03:29:38.020]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:38.500]  So, thank you.
[03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:44.363]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[03:29:44.483 --> 03:29:45.964]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[03:29:46.204 --> 03:29:48.106]  Because it is from the top lab in the country.
[03:29:48.186 --> 03:29:49.787]  Discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[03:29:49.867 --> 03:29:52.910]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[03:29:54.812 --> 03:29:56.674]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:29:56.714 --> 03:29:57.054]  Go ahead.
[03:29:57.955 --> 03:29:59.856]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:29:59.896 --> 03:30:09.265]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:30:10.064 --> 03:30:16.625]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:30:16.845 --> 03:30:18.986]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:30:19.086 --> 03:30:19.486]  Thank you.
[03:30:20.146 --> 03:30:22.626]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:30:22.646 --> 03:30:26.387]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:30:26.947 --> 03:30:29.928]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:30:29.988 --> 03:30:30.968]  They are quality.
[03:30:31.288 --> 03:30:32.568]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:30:33.028 --> 03:30:35.749]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:30:35.769 --> 03:30:36.029]  Absolutely.
[03:30:36.409 --> 03:30:36.970]  Absolutely.
[03:30:36.990 --> 03:30:49.881]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:30:56.554 --> 03:31:14.863]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I might speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:31:14.964 --> 03:31:20.366]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:31:21.247 --> 03:31:21.927]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:31:22.367 --> 03:31:25.189]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:31:25.849 --> 03:31:26.810]  And so much more.
[03:31:27.370 --> 03:31:28.510]  It is concentrated.
[03:31:28.730 --> 03:31:30.471]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:31:30.551 --> 03:31:36.154]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:31:36.274 --> 03:31:37.474]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:31:37.494 --> 03:31:39.415]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:31:39.495 --> 03:31:41.896]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:31:42.096 --> 03:31:43.337]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:31:43.537 --> 03:31:45.338]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:31:45.898 --> 03:31:46.498]  Immune Wall.
[03:31:46.598 --> 03:31:49.200]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:55.307 --> 03:31:56.048]  I'm so excited.
[03:31:56.108 --> 03:32:05.674]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:32:06.254 --> 03:32:14.580]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:32:14.780 --> 03:32:23.526]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:32:25.647 --> 03:32:44.762]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:45.242 --> 03:32:46.543]  It is amazing!
[03:32:47.924 --> 03:32:52.908]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:32:58.622 --> 03:33:03.184]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:20.691]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:21.072 --> 03:33:22.992]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.393 --> 03:33:26.554]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:33.441]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex here in the fourth hour.
[03:33:33.461 --> 03:33:35.482]  Good to be here at InfoWars.
[03:33:36.522 --> 03:33:55.890]  Before we jump in on the subject of globalism, of course, just want to remind you about the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Purifier, which is now $50 off with free shipping for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:58.112 --> 03:34:02.734]  Dust, bacteria, allergens, viruses and so forth in the air.
[03:34:03.975 --> 03:34:15.781]  But with the revolutionary air purification system, Alexa Pure, you can remove a huge percentage of these airborne toxins and contaminants in your home.
[03:34:15.801 --> 03:34:17.501]  It's a game changer.
[03:34:18.122 --> 03:34:19.963]  Comparable units cost as much as $800.
[03:34:22.003 --> 03:34:24.885]  Bringing it to you here at InfoWars, Alexa Pure
[03:34:26.487 --> 03:34:29.188]  $50 off with free shipping.
[03:34:30.869 --> 03:34:37.914]  You buy products that make you stronger and healthier, you fund the info war.
[03:34:38.494 --> 03:34:40.996]  That's the long and the short of it, folks.
[03:34:43.497 --> 03:34:47.319]  I haven't done an overview on globalism for some time.
[03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:51.142]  So in the time remaining in this hour,
[03:34:52.142 --> 03:35:16.773]  I want to just focus in cleanly and clearly on some of the major agendas that work together, like a tinker toy, like a system to defame, deface, degrade, take down the planet in order to run it from a central control point.
[03:35:18.053 --> 03:35:19.174]  That's the agenda.
[03:35:20.138 --> 03:35:21.118]  Of globalism.
[03:35:21.218 --> 03:35:23.219]  It involves wrecking economies.
[03:35:24.199 --> 03:35:30.321]  It involves engendering chaos, conflict, divide and conquer wherever possible.
[03:35:33.322 --> 03:35:37.083]  Politicians from one end of the planet to the other are caught up in it.
[03:35:38.063 --> 03:35:39.083]  They are agents.
[03:35:39.503 --> 03:35:40.524]  They are assets.
[03:35:41.484 --> 03:35:43.204]  They are blackmailable.
[03:35:43.224 --> 03:35:48.286]  Bureaucracies that grow larger by the day.
[03:35:50.553 --> 03:35:53.975]  Are the human machine that powers it?
[03:35:55.677 --> 03:36:03.242]  And of course, governments collaborate with corporations and corporations collaborate with governments.
[03:36:04.262 --> 03:36:10.166]  What do you think the evil censorship push is all about?
[03:36:11.547 --> 03:36:19.893]  Anything that has even the faintest whiff of anti-globalism comes under the scrutiny of these
[03:36:20.772 --> 03:36:30.738]  Agencies and corporations such as social media giants and they want to excise it from the body politic because it is a threat.
[03:36:32.058 --> 03:36:32.699]  Because.
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:44.085]  Anything that potentially can wake people up as individuals to their own freedom and power and their inherent natural rights.
[03:36:46.046 --> 03:36:46.807]  That is.
[03:36:46.827 --> 03:36:46.887]  War.
[03:36:49.753 --> 03:36:59.920]  That is war for the globalists, and they have to squash it, censor it, wipe it out to the greatest degree possible.
[03:37:01.181 --> 03:37:02.782]  That's their MO.
[03:37:03.083 --> 03:37:04.103]  That's what they're doing.
[03:37:04.864 --> 03:37:09.687]  They've lost the argument in the last year and a half, two years.
[03:37:10.448 --> 03:37:13.230]  They have really lost the argument.
[03:37:14.634 --> 03:37:18.355]  There is no more discussion or debate as far as they're concerned.
[03:37:18.395 --> 03:37:21.896]  I'm talking about every major media outlet in the world as well.
[03:37:23.357 --> 03:37:24.677]  There's nothing they can say.
[03:37:26.758 --> 03:37:34.460]  There's nothing they can do that is going to convince people on any rational basis to give up their freedom.
[03:37:36.081 --> 03:37:38.221]  Because freedom is on the table.
[03:37:39.402 --> 03:37:40.562]  It's out in the open.
[03:37:41.255 --> 03:37:48.898]  Do you want to be free and independent or do you want to be dependent and a slave?
[03:37:50.158 --> 03:37:54.060]  People are waking up by the millions to this.
[03:37:55.760 --> 03:38:08.625]  The mass immigration program is nothing more and nothing less than a way of engendering chaos and destruction and a way of eradicating borders
[03:38:09.648 --> 03:38:13.830]  Because separate nations are an anathema to the globalists.
[03:38:14.730 --> 03:38:17.031]  They can't deal with that.
[03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:20.132]  They can't deal with nationalism.
[03:38:21.113 --> 03:38:30.797]  They certainly cannot deal with any nation whose people or leaders say, we want to be internally strong.
[03:38:31.957 --> 03:38:33.438]  We want to be prosperous.
[03:38:34.118 --> 03:38:36.599]  We want to have a prosperous economy.
[03:38:36.659 --> 03:38:39.120]  We want to have a favorable trade balance.
[03:38:41.545 --> 03:38:46.009]  We want to empower people economically across the board.
[03:38:47.170 --> 03:38:48.811]  We want to raise people up.
[03:38:49.812 --> 03:38:57.558]  Any whiff or hint of that is like a stake coming at the heart of vampires.
[03:38:58.579 --> 03:39:03.003]  The globalists cannot stand that and they have to squash it out.
[03:39:05.044 --> 03:39:10.409]  What does mass migration from country to country to country to country do?
[03:39:11.909 --> 03:39:12.950]  You know the facts.
[03:39:13.430 --> 03:39:14.130]  You're aware.
[03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.930]  You're awake.
[03:39:15.031 --> 03:39:22.034]  You see elevated levels of crime, gigantic burdens on taxpayers.
[03:39:22.894 --> 03:39:28.757]  Governments go into insupportable debt, as is happening in the state of California, for example.
[03:39:30.658 --> 03:39:35.780]  And so many other negative, to say the least, consequences.
[03:39:37.401 --> 03:39:39.942]  But that doesn't matter to the globalists.
[03:39:40.851 --> 03:40:07.817]  They must use this, not just use mass migration, but initiate it, make it part of their ongoing agenda at the level of the European Union, at the level of the United Nations, in the name of humanity, of course, which is the BS propaganda, in order to eradicate borders and therefore eradicate nations.
[03:40:09.077 --> 03:40:09.977]  Look at their rhetoric.
[03:40:10.583 --> 03:40:11.684]  Look at what they're saying.
[03:40:12.324 --> 03:40:13.364]  Look at what they're doing.
[03:40:14.605 --> 03:40:40.278]  Are you aware, for example, that the prestigious National Academy of Sciences in America, which is one of the most elevated groups of scientists, recently carried out a study in which volunteers were dosed with a hormone called oxytocin, called the love hormone or the hugging hormone.
[03:40:41.192 --> 03:40:51.516]  In order to get them to change their negative views about immigrants and mass immigration, the study happened.
[03:40:51.576 --> 03:40:52.817]  The study was carried out.
[03:40:54.097 --> 03:41:02.941]  Social programming cues plus chemical dosing with a hormone and neurotransmitter called oxytocin.
[03:41:04.281 --> 03:41:08.423]  And the study authors made no bones about it.
[03:41:10.064 --> 03:41:10.784]  They assumed
[03:41:11.744 --> 03:41:28.237]  That not only would mass immigration continue as an ongoing program across the planet, but they also assumed that there were no reasonable or rational objections that anybody could possibly have to this program.
[03:41:28.417 --> 03:41:41.327]  And therefore, the only reason that people would be opposed is because they were deficient in a hormone which they would supply, never mind
[03:41:41.937 --> 03:41:48.661]  The negative adverse effects of such a hormone that creates imbalance in the endocrine system or any of that.
[03:41:48.701 --> 03:41:49.501]  Forget all that.
[03:41:49.941 --> 03:42:02.868]  No, we're going to supply as much oxytocin as necessary to change the minds of people to program them and control them.
[03:42:04.189 --> 03:42:10.252]  This is mind control on a chemical level so that they would be passive and accepting and welcoming.
[03:42:11.098 --> 03:42:19.321]  No matter how many immigrants came in or who they were or what they did, people would just be oblivious to that.
[03:42:19.781 --> 03:42:23.042]  So do you think this is an isolated study just for the fun of it?
[03:42:23.683 --> 03:42:24.503]  No, of course not.
[03:42:25.824 --> 03:42:35.127]  The study authors claim that they have found what they call a socio-biological underpinning
[03:42:35.956 --> 03:42:38.677]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:42:38.737 --> 03:42:40.797]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:42:41.018 --> 03:42:44.679]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:03.596 --> 03:43:14.641]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:15.081 --> 03:43:24.205]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:43:24.685 --> 03:43:30.250]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:43:30.470 --> 03:43:35.635]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:43:35.915 --> 03:43:37.877]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:38.177 --> 03:43:40.199]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:43:41.198 --> 03:43:44.259]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:45.860]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:46.500 --> 03:43:49.041]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:43:49.802 --> 03:43:51.763]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:52.343 --> 03:43:54.604]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[03:43:58.496 --> 03:44:00.257]  William Binney is our guest.
[03:44:00.777 --> 03:44:07.681]  He is the former technical leader of the intelligence with NSA before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 after more than 30 years of the agency.
[03:44:08.041 --> 03:44:11.182]  Binney's been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[03:44:11.843 --> 03:44:15.985]  And again, he is the technical advisor for the film Snowden.
[03:44:16.585 --> 03:44:17.445]  It is so amazing.
[03:44:17.745 --> 03:44:22.686]  Again, this was published today at the Director of National Intelligence website.
[03:44:23.446 --> 03:44:28.367]  William Binney, who's been advising the CIA Director and others, let us know the minute it went out.
[03:44:28.427 --> 03:44:40.649]  This is the secret memo that's so troubling that ties into all the perjury and the cabal of Clinton operatives trying to set the President and others up using the might of the surveillance grid that's meant for foreign powers against the American people.
[03:44:40.769 --> 03:44:42.650]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:44:42.850 --> 03:44:44.430]  William Binney, start wherever you think's best.
[03:44:46.655 --> 03:45:02.567]  I'd like to start with some of the things they're talking about on page 15 of that ruling, where they talked about NSA having the authority to go in the upstream program and take down main communications trunks.
[03:45:04.388 --> 03:45:11.373]  And because they think there's some terrorist or dope dealer on there, and they can capture and keep the entire trunk.
[03:45:11.893 --> 03:45:12.193]  Lie.
[03:45:12.553 --> 03:45:14.554]  Capture all the data and keep it all.
[03:45:14.974 --> 03:45:17.195]  And sort it and interrogate it.
[03:45:17.235 --> 03:45:21.817]  That's basically how NSA analysts are able to look at their lovers if they're cheating on them.
[03:45:21.857 --> 03:45:22.818]  That's how they can do that.
[03:45:23.278 --> 03:45:24.158]  Under that authority.
[03:45:24.218 --> 03:45:25.439]  But that's all done in secret.
[03:45:25.539 --> 03:45:28.800]  The FISA court is speaking to it there in their ruling.
[03:45:28.900 --> 03:45:30.021]  This is the upstream program.
[03:45:30.041 --> 03:45:32.482]  It's the tafs on the fiber lines where they take everything.
[03:45:33.118 --> 03:45:44.704]  And that's really what I was trying to say about President Trump when he was being targeted in all the data they were collecting, including his entire staff on this committee and everything.
[03:45:45.044 --> 03:45:50.807]  They were all being spoofed up in this bulk acquisition off the fiber lines in the Upstream program.
[03:45:51.547 --> 03:45:55.189]  And the main slide that would show it, if you could put it up, is the Fairview program.
[03:45:55.729 --> 03:45:59.751]  That is AT&T's tapping points inside the 48 states of the United States.
[03:46:00.402 --> 03:46:06.487]  And you notice all the tap points are distributed with... This is the one that no mainstream media wants to show on TV.
[03:46:07.047 --> 03:46:11.491]  Because this is the one that calls out this business about they're only after foreigners is an obvious lie!
[03:46:11.691 --> 03:46:20.018]  You know, unless you face them and go after them and do something about this, you're not going to correct the problem in the future and people will look back and say, well, they got away with it, so I'll do it too.
[03:46:20.338 --> 03:46:23.801]  That's why I blamed this all on Jerry Ford when he pardoned Nixon, you know?
[03:46:24.321 --> 03:46:27.082]  When he did that, he said every president can do anything he wants.
[03:46:27.122 --> 03:46:28.923]  He's now got to get out of jail free card.
[03:46:28.943 --> 03:46:32.124]  That's the next president, who also wants to be able to do whatever he wants.
[03:46:32.544 --> 03:46:36.645]  So, you see, that was where I put the blame right there with Jerry Ford.
[03:46:36.725 --> 03:46:43.127]  And if he had let Nixon go to trial and be indicted, then I don't believe that this would have happened.
[03:46:43.407 --> 03:46:46.588]  But we haven't done any indictments of any of these people who have done similar crimes.
[03:46:46.668 --> 03:46:49.509]  And now, for massive crimes, we haven't done any of that.
[03:46:49.529 --> 03:46:51.090]  And that's really what we need to do.
[03:46:58.655 --> 03:47:01.396]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.802 --> 03:47:19.704]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:20.324 --> 03:47:23.285]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.365 --> 03:47:26.967]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:47:30.379 --> 03:47:34.503]  Okay, in the fourth hour sitting in for Alex, our survey of globalism.
[03:47:35.364 --> 03:47:40.309]  I'm going to compress this down and try to get as much as I can in before the top of the hour.
[03:47:41.430 --> 03:47:47.535]  Trade treaties, the stock market, megacorporations, tariffs.
[03:47:48.737 --> 03:47:51.679]  What does all this have to do with globalism?
[03:47:52.220 --> 03:47:55.583]  Coming out of World War II, the plans
[03:47:56.149 --> 03:48:08.376]  The master plan was that megacorporations would be the wedge into every country in the world for the spread of globalism, the control of the planet top-down.
[03:48:09.857 --> 03:48:15.900]  These megacorporations wanted one central thing, no tariffs, meaning
[03:48:16.727 --> 03:48:41.760]  They could set up shop anywhere in the world, slave wages, no environmental protections of any kind, workers committing suicide, whatever, produce their products dirt cheap, export them anywhere in the world, and when those products entered those countries where they were exported, no taxes, no tariffs, in other words, no protection.
[03:48:42.785 --> 03:48:50.391]  For the domestic producers in those countries who were making similar products, destroy those people, just knock them out.
[03:48:50.491 --> 03:49:04.522]  In fact, as we've seen in the US, for example, major corporations close down their factories, say we're going to X country and we're going to set up the same factory, so we're firing all you people here.
[03:49:04.922 --> 03:49:06.063]  We don't care about you.
[03:49:06.724 --> 03:49:09.026]  You are indeed the deplorables.
[03:49:11.568 --> 03:49:11.728]  So,
[03:49:13.507 --> 03:49:14.948]  That's their game plan.
[03:49:15.028 --> 03:49:22.313]  That's how they pump up the megacorporations to incredible levels of profit.
[03:49:24.775 --> 03:49:41.546]  So recently, when Trump said, OK, we're going to put some tariffs on folks, welcome back tariffs on steel and aluminum, 25 percent and 10 percent, meaning when these imports came, they were going to be taxed.
[03:49:42.276 --> 03:49:55.566]  To put them on a reasonably competitive level with existing and potential steel and aluminum producers in the United States, who could then swing back into production.
[03:49:56.987 --> 03:50:04.432]  Well, again, this is like a silver bullet aimed at the brain of a werewolf, as far as the globalists are concerned, the werewolves.
[03:50:05.253 --> 03:50:05.993]  No tariffs!
[03:50:06.013 --> 03:50:06.854]  We can't have any tariffs!
[03:50:06.874 --> 03:50:07.414]  No tariffs!
[03:50:07.454 --> 03:50:08.055]  No tariffs!
[03:50:09.015 --> 03:50:11.197]  And as I warned, and as I predicted,
[03:50:11.952 --> 03:50:13.973]  The stock market was going to wobble.
[03:50:15.154 --> 03:50:26.742]  And we saw Gary Cohn, who had been Trump's economic advisor, also the past president CEO of Goldman Sachs, resign.
[03:50:27.163 --> 03:50:28.504]  I'm going to resign my job.
[03:50:29.204 --> 03:50:29.684]  He left.
[03:50:31.686 --> 03:50:38.451]  The stock market is used on any president as leverage by the globalists.
[03:50:39.051 --> 03:50:40.192]  You do what we say,
[03:50:41.573 --> 03:50:47.597]  Don't cross this line or we will take down the stock market.
[03:50:48.137 --> 03:50:58.924]  And then everybody will believe, no matter what the truth is, that the overall economy is crashing and collapsing because of you, Mr. President, and your economic policies.
[03:50:59.425 --> 03:51:01.226]  And the media will back us up.
[03:51:02.607 --> 03:51:04.408]  We will manipulate the stock market.
[03:51:04.428 --> 03:51:06.449]  It has nothing to do with the overall economy.
[03:51:06.489 --> 03:51:07.890]  It's just a giant casino.
[03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.970]  But
[03:51:10.243 --> 03:51:24.730]  All of our media people, media people are prepared, indoctrinated, brainwashed to believe that the stock market and the overall economy are intrinsically joined at the hip and that will be your fate.
[03:51:25.330 --> 03:51:26.451]  That's your destiny.
[03:51:26.531 --> 03:51:28.071]  That's what's going to happen to you.
[03:51:28.672 --> 03:51:30.172]  So Trump overstepped.
[03:51:31.893 --> 03:51:35.075]  Tariffs are coming back, he said, on key elements.
[03:51:36.115 --> 03:51:37.676]  Seeing the stock market wobble.
[03:51:40.277 --> 03:51:55.466]  So these trade treaties that have been enacted since the end of World War II are all about eliminating tariffs and making the way for megacorporations to rule the earth under the umbrella of globalism.
[03:51:56.327 --> 03:51:57.107]  That's the deal.
[03:51:58.769 --> 03:52:07.274]  And finally, and this may be the most important aspect while I'm eliminating the medical cartel, which is a
[03:52:08.243 --> 03:52:16.310]  Major, major arm of globalism, but I've talked about that many times on the show here, so we'll put that aside for today.
[03:52:18.352 --> 03:52:23.176]  Energy use by every human on the planet.
[03:52:24.136 --> 03:52:24.917]  Energy use.
[03:52:25.758 --> 03:52:32.123]  What do you think the pseudoscience called global warming or climate change is all about?
[03:52:32.143 --> 03:52:33.584]  It is to
[03:52:35.336 --> 03:52:51.182]  Indoctrinate people to the idea that we're destroying the planet and therefore energy production in all countries in the world has to be lowered 15%, 20% in order to save the planet.
[03:52:52.762 --> 03:52:55.463]  That's the big lie.
[03:52:57.184 --> 03:53:03.486]  Not talking about actual pollution here, we're talking about this pseudoscientific theory that's been floated.
[03:53:04.594 --> 03:53:29.171]  And the corollary to that, the bottom line is, well, therefore, by limiting energy production all over the planet, we now have to go further and begin to assign energy quotas at first to nations, to industries, etc., etc., etc., which we, the globalists, can measure
[03:53:30.094 --> 03:53:37.296]  And then we have to take it even further down to the individual human being, no matter where he or she lives.
[03:53:37.916 --> 03:53:50.079]  And we have these wonderful devices called smart meters, which we're going to install by the ton all over the planet, long term goal, so that we can detect
[03:53:50.791 --> 03:54:03.237]  Down to the finest level, the amount of energy that you, my friend, are using wherever you live and which devices you're using and how much each device uses of energy.
[03:54:04.637 --> 03:54:10.040]  The ultimate game plan here, and this is in the sustainability program of the United Nations.
[03:54:12.721 --> 03:54:15.782]  Quotas to measure your energy use.
[03:54:17.063 --> 03:54:19.564]  And to say there is a ceiling
[03:54:20.390 --> 03:54:21.390]  on your energy use.
[03:54:22.011 --> 03:54:29.994]  And we know what that ceiling is because we know how much energy is being produced on a continuous basis on planet Earth.
[03:54:30.634 --> 03:54:35.937]  These are the technocrats talking, who are the globalists at the highest level.
[03:54:37.117 --> 03:54:44.700]  And we will eventually enforce that quota, that ceiling quota on you for energy use.
[03:54:47.162 --> 03:54:48.042]  So in fact,
[03:54:48.786 --> 03:54:57.393]  It will be as if, if not literally, figuratively, you have a credit card, an energy credit card.
[03:54:57.893 --> 03:55:03.478]  And when it runs out, no more energy until the next period begins.
[03:55:05.219 --> 03:55:13.986]  That's one of the ultimate threads of control that the globalists are working toward as we speak right now.
[03:55:14.687 --> 03:55:17.149]  And the incoming 5G system
[03:55:18.022 --> 03:55:27.264]  Of, oh, you know, faster Netflix and faster idiot news broadcasts and, oh, we've got to make things faster and faster and faster.
[03:55:27.724 --> 03:55:29.564]  It's not as good as we could have it now.
[03:55:30.504 --> 03:55:45.907]  That will also be deployed to finer judge how much energy, how much electricity, et cetera, et cetera, is being deployed around the planet and where in order to set
[03:55:46.602 --> 03:55:50.884]  energy quotas as well as to harm people with these transmissions.
[03:55:51.104 --> 03:55:52.505]  No question about that now.
[03:55:54.406 --> 03:55:58.027]  So that is where this is all going unless it's stopped.
[03:55:59.708 --> 03:56:05.431]  And you and we are the people who are offering the resistance to that.
[03:56:06.031 --> 03:56:07.952]  Not just a passive resistance.
[03:56:09.993 --> 03:56:11.714]  Don't stay on the defense.
[03:56:12.754 --> 03:56:13.935]  That's not the idea.
[03:56:14.801 --> 03:56:22.563]  The idea is to wake up as many people as possible in as short a time as possible to what is happening.
[03:56:23.904 --> 03:56:29.785]  Globalism is just the modern face of ancient tyranny.
[03:56:30.465 --> 03:56:32.786]  It's just wearing a different suit.
[03:56:33.726 --> 03:56:36.107]  It's employing different technology.
[03:56:37.387 --> 03:56:42.869]  It's intrusive and invasive and destructive in exactly the same way.
[03:56:44.438 --> 03:56:51.001]  And psychologically and spiritually, what it is saying to every individual on the planet is you have no power.
[03:56:52.302 --> 03:56:52.922]  You have none.
[03:56:53.622 --> 03:56:54.723]  That was a fantasy.
[03:56:55.303 --> 03:56:59.345]  In fact, you as an individual are a fantasy.
[03:57:00.484 --> 03:57:06.786]  This is some delusion that you have fostered within yourself to think of yourself as an individual.
[03:57:07.246 --> 03:57:08.827]  Individuals don't even exist.
[03:57:09.367 --> 03:57:10.587]  Only groups exist.
[03:57:10.767 --> 03:57:12.528]  Only the collective exists.
[03:57:12.748 --> 03:57:14.549]  Only the hive mind exists.
[03:57:15.109 --> 03:57:18.890]  At a spiritual level, only collective consciousness exists.
[03:57:18.970 --> 03:57:21.471]  There is no consciousness that is yours.
[03:57:22.511 --> 03:57:26.973]  That is some sort of historical delusion that we are wiping out.
[03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:30.541]  As well as wiping out you, the individual.
[03:57:31.321 --> 03:57:32.581]  That's where they're going.
[03:57:33.081 --> 03:57:36.402]  And we're the people who are going to stop them.
[03:57:36.422 --> 03:57:38.263]  Thanks for listening in the fourth hour.
[03:57:38.923 --> 03:57:44.944]  See you in a couple.
[03:57:45.405 --> 03:57:54.167]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[03:57:55.478 --> 03:57:57.280]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:57:57.320 --> 03:58:04.448]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:58:04.848 --> 03:58:10.654]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:58:11.335 --> 03:58:12.636]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:58:13.257 --> 03:58:32.310]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:58:33.391 --> 03:58:37.513]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[03:58:37.833 --> 03:58:43.116]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[03:58:43.516 --> 03:58:44.557]  As above, so below.
[03:58:45.117 --> 03:58:49.939]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the most tiniest scales.
[03:58:50.439 --> 03:58:51.560]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:58:51.960 --> 03:58:53.441]  America is building its wall.
[03:58:53.841 --> 03:58:54.321]  Will it work?
[03:58:54.461 --> 03:58:54.942]  We don't know.
[03:58:55.442 --> 03:58:56.042]  Is Trump right?
[03:58:56.723 --> 03:58:58.784]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
