[00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.719]  25 days, ladies and gentlemen, 25 days to the midterms.
[00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.881]  And we knew it was coming.
[00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.764]  I warned everyone over and over again that I was patient zero.
[00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:58.984]  The first domino to be totally deplatformed, and now, working in concert, Twitter and Facebook banned 800 major conservative, Christian, libertarian, pro-life, pro-gun pages, some that had millions of followers apiece, from major, major publications.
[00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:02.625]  Everybody from Press for Truth to Michelle Malkin's page to you name it, 800!
[00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:07.343]  In one day, banned.
[00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:09.644]  And you know what they said?
[00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:14.366]  They said, you are fake news.
[00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:21.310]  There's the Washington Post, Facebook purges over 800 US accounts and pages for pushing political spam.
[00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.291]  And then you read, it's in the fake news category.
[00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.213]  So, it's, oh, now it's spam!
[00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:33.416]  Oh, no, it's called being popular, and it's called the Washington Post,
[00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:41.904]  Who's all part of this cartel of mainstream media that goes around and judges what's fake news, what's spam, what's hate.
[00:01:41.904 --> 00:01:46.208]  And then now they're banned for being fake news and spam.
[00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:47.889]  They're banned because they're popular.
[00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.053]  And I'm going to explain when we come back how this works.
[00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:53.895]  But you have to understand, 15 years ago,
[00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.774]  90 plus percent of the internet was not social media networks.
[00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:05.978]  It was individual sites and a giant archipelago of millions and millions of popular sites.
[00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:08.078]  It was a vibrant internet and Matt Grudge warned.
[00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:22.965]  He said, you're all giving all your traffic to these places, you're pushing your audiences to Facebook and Twitter and these other globalist platforms, these gulags, the term he used was ghettos, digital ghettos.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:41.189]  And in the last 15 years, it went from 90 plus percent being millions of individual sites that all got great traffic, and then billions of sites total, to four sites that get 90 plus percent of the traffic.
[00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:50.153]  And of course, radio shows, TV shows, everyone pushed their Facebook, everyone pushed their Twitter, everyone pushed their audience onto their and their content.
[00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:53.535]  And now the rug's being pulled out from under everybody.
[00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:58.797]  They're going, oh, we're our own companies, we're our own sites.
[00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:03.219]  But then they fight to shut down Gab.com and Infowars.com.
[00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:11.123]  And the Democrats have Federal Elections Commission meetings and say, we want Matt Drudge shut down.
[00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:13.904]  Oh, we want the payment processors of Alex Jones taken.
[00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:17.606]  Where's Congress?
[00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:19.487]  Eight hundred.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:35.968]  And you added up, it's tens upon tens of millions of followers that went and subscribed, that gave their content on those conservative and nationalist and patriot sites, and they're all gone.
[00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:37.288]  All gone.
[00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:44.832]  Not one strike, not two strikes, not three strikes, like they used to have, oh, so-called rules, they were still arbitrary and run by SJWs.
[00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:47.814]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they're just gone.
[00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:51.230]  Including real liberal sites.
[00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.751]  I would call Dan Dix a liberal.
[00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:55.753]  Liberal libertarian.
[00:03:55.753 --> 00:03:57.974]  Socially liberal, but a smart guy, filmmaker.
[00:03:57.974 --> 00:03:59.295]  He had 300,000 followers.
[00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.256]  Very popular filmmaker.
[00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:01.356]  Gone!
[00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:06.560]  Because they don't want real liberals around making other liberals look stupid.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.821]  Who are fake liberals.
[00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:08.861]  So they're gone.
[00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.503]  And oh, don't worry.
[00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:15.426]  The Los Angeles Times and everyone else, they're all just celebrating.
[00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.262]  Now, people like Dan Dixon and others were smart.
[00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:19.243]  They had backup accounts.
[00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:21.445]  But see, oh, they'll get to those.
[00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:23.647]  They'll get to those.
[00:04:23.647 --> 00:04:25.989]  Now, that's big news and it's coming up.
[00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:28.070]  The amazing Kanye West event.
[00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.536]  The total racism of an all-white panel talking about how
[00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.232]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.330]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.313]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:19.777]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.380]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.921]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:37.070]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[00:05:38.228 --> 00:05:41.951]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:43.132]  We'll win.
[00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:45.474]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:53.180]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.883]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win.
[00:05:56.883 --> 00:05:58.445]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:05:58.445 --> 00:05:59.305]  We need your support.
[00:05:59.305 --> 00:05:59.846]  I'm counting on you.
[00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:11.491]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:23.019]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:31.485]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:41.081]  It's scary to not wear this hat, my own friends.
[00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.984]  But this hat, it gives me power in a way.
[00:06:44.984 --> 00:06:52.471]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[00:06:52.471 --> 00:07:00.077]  And also, I'm married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on.
[00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:01.458]  It's beautiful though.
[00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.080]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about
[00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.043]  You know, I love Hillary, I love everyone, right?
[00:07:08.043 --> 00:07:18.290]  But the campaign, I'm with her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.
[00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.573]  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[00:07:22.573 --> 00:07:26.936]  You made a Superman, that's my favorite superhero, and you made a Superman king.
[00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:28.517]  For me, I love you.
[00:07:28.517 --> 00:07:28.977]  I know.
[00:07:28.977 --> 00:07:31.938]  But I don't want to put you in that spot.
[00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:33.819]  No, I'm standing in that spot.
[00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.080]  I love this guy right here.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.702]  Let me give this guy a hug right here.
[00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:41.263]  I love this guy right here.
[00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:43.384]  That's really nice.
[00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:44.305]  And that's from the heart.
[00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:45.826]  I didn't want to put you in that position.
[00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:48.007]  But that's from the heart.
[00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:57.259]  It is Friday, the 12th day of October 2018.
[00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:58.801]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:03.846]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, and the war room's coming up.
[00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:10.473]  And I intend to open the phones up and take your phone calls throughout the entire transmission today.
[00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:14.418]  To put it lightly, the confirmation
[00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:19.443]  That the globalists are as evil as we thought they were.
[00:08:19.443 --> 00:08:21.885]  In fact, they're worse than we thought they were.
[00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:32.990]  And their completely taking of the mask off is a spiritual and cultural temper tantrum.
[00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:38.753]  It's like a demon being exercised out of the body.
[00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:56.092]  And when you look at the behavior of Soros and Hillary and all of these demonic entities, that's what they are, literally, you are witnessing their death throes politically and spiritually.
[00:08:56.092 --> 00:08:59.936]  And we've got clips dealing with Kanye today that are so insane
[00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:03.807]  I don't have words to describe it.
[00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:21.723]  The hit-and-run individual, who's allowed to hit and run in public while he's drunk driving, Chris Cuomo of CNN, with no viewers, he came out and said, we're gonna play the clip coming up, Trump looked like he was thinking racist thoughts.
[00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:26.307]  So they're projecting that out there now on the weak-minded.
[00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:26.908]  Other hosts,
[00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:49.402]  said that Kanye West was a black ventriloquist dummy doll and that Trump basically was telling him what to say and that Kanye West is a black ventriloquist doll for white supremacy.
[00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:52.916]  That's right.
[00:09:52.916 --> 00:10:04.462]  A bunch of successful men who built their own incredible careers are there hugging on each other and meeting Mr. Brown, Mr. West, Mr. Trump.
[00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:13.167]  They're all there meeting, talking about how they want to bring America and the world together and how they want to invest in the
[00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:28.229]  Black community particularly, and to try to get fathers back in the homes, and try to have male energy infused back in, because what the globalists are doing is removing male energy so that they can lead and control everyone.
[00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:29.530]  They're breaking the human cycle.
[00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.252]  They're not trying to put feminine energy in charge.
[00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:36.515]  They're trying to have corporate energy in control with divided slaves.
[00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:37.735]  That's in their WikiLeaks.
[00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:38.636]  It's in their own documents.
[00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:43.659]  And Kanye West is bringing a message of truth, a message of courage,
[00:10:46.576 --> 00:10:53.783]  And he pointed out that Trump is on a hero's quest and walking the walk of a hero.
[00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:56.105]  And that's what's happening here.
[00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:59.809]  And the evil does not know what to do.
[00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:02.071]  And so what does Don Lemon and all the other hosts say?
[00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:10.019]  They say, poor Kanye, he is a, like a black minstrel actor.
[00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:40.610]  Minstrel shows where they would make fun of black people and and and and others and that he is These are all quotes That that he is a uneducated dumb Negro that doesn't read I Mean, this is the most stereotypical racist horrible crap and then they edit what he says out of context So it doesn't make sense and they sit back and say look at the dumb black man Who's self-made and who has courage?
[00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:50.351]  Because the truth is, if anybody is a house slave, it's Don Lemon.
[00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:52.492]  He's a house slave of Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:52.492 --> 00:11:55.934]  And you can be black, you can be white, you can be brown.
[00:11:55.934 --> 00:12:00.097]  You can be yellow, you can be pink.
[00:12:00.097 --> 00:12:04.219]  You can be lying on a morgue slab and be purple, or blue.
[00:12:04.219 --> 00:12:06.941]  But if you serve the globalists, you are a slave.
[00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:12.381]  Because see, slavery isn't about a skin color.
[00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:13.921]  It's about a position you're in.
[00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:17.503]  And a lot of slaves are slaves willingly.
[00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:22.785]  Like the soy boy, Don Lemon.
[00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.646]  The race pimp, Don Lemon.
[00:12:25.646 --> 00:12:27.007]  Following the sick script.
[00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:31.049]  So, I'm going to play all those clips when we come back.
[00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:34.230]  And I'm going to play Mr. Brown's great speech from C-SPAN.
[00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.852]  And I'm going to get to a lot more coming up and I'm going to take your calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:41.864]  Here's the big news after the next segment.
[00:12:41.864 --> 00:12:47.529]  At the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:49.811]  This is the Washington Post.
[00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.072]  Facebook purges over 800 U.S.
[00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:55.055]  accounts and pages for pushing political spam.
[00:12:55.055 --> 00:12:56.456]  And that's not counting Twitter.
[00:12:56.456 --> 00:13:00.279]  The big news here is... In fact, the numbers are coming out.
[00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.260]  It's worth 800.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.263]  They did it in exact concert in the same hour.
[00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:11.614]  As Twitter.
[00:13:11.614 --> 00:13:16.015]  And what did the good folks over at Buzzkill say?
[00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:17.715]  Buzzfeed?
[00:13:17.715 --> 00:13:18.515]  Fake News Kings?
[00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:20.696]  But they also do get the inside baseball.
[00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:22.517]  Oh, remember about six weeks ago?
[00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:28.598]  Oh, Facebook and Twitter and Google, they all met in secret to decide how to run the midterms.
[00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:30.319]  They even said how to respond to it.
[00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:38.101]  And you're seeing, and I predicted that right up to the election, they would end up banning every libertarian, Christian, conservative site
[00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.410]  Off these platforms.
[00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.031]  And they've now done it.
[00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.753]  And it's going to get worse.
[00:13:44.753 --> 00:14:04.090]  Oh, and now governments around the country, Democrat-run cities, they want to know if you're a Christian or a conservative, and they make you declare it on forms if you've ever been involved or a member of the NRA, and they're saying, we're not going to give you government contracts for cement or paper or food programs, for anything,
[00:14:05.347 --> 00:14:10.674]  If you are a conservative, if you are a gun supporter, you heard me.
[00:14:10.674 --> 00:14:11.615]  And why not?
[00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:13.577]  They're getting away with it.
[00:14:13.577 --> 00:14:14.739]  They got away with banning me.
[00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:16.121]  I told her about it.
[00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.562]  They're like, how are you taking it?
[00:14:17.562 --> 00:14:20.106]  Well, I'm taking it really bad because it means they're going to go after everybody.
[00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:21.963]  They're going to try to steal the election.
[00:14:21.963 --> 00:14:26.806]  And then they're going to go after what we say on the street and where we work and what religion we are.
[00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:28.547]  This is real authoritarianism.
[00:14:28.547 --> 00:14:29.648]  Oh, come on, Alex.
[00:14:29.648 --> 00:14:31.489]  You know, they say you're fake news.
[00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:32.730]  No, they're the fake news.
[00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:39.694]  They put out lies about me to set the precedent so Congress would sit there on their butts when this happened.
[00:14:39.694 --> 00:14:41.255]  And the Pentagon knows what's going on.
[00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:42.456]  Trump knows what's going on.
[00:14:42.456 --> 00:14:48.460]  He's surrounded by a bunch of addled yes-men who are all on the bankroll, the payroll,
[00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:51.418]  Of these big tech companies.
[00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:52.539]  They buy them cheap.
[00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:53.579]  Senators.
[00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:57.220]  You know, Google might give $50,000 to each senator laying on a year.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.741]  Nothing!
[00:14:58.741 --> 00:15:01.261]  These are trillion dollar companies.
[00:15:01.261 --> 00:15:05.443]  They bought us up like a cheap whore.
[00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:07.723]  A $5 hooker.
[00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:09.744]  Now they're putting cigarettes out on us.
[00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:11.645]  And now they're slicing us up.
[00:15:11.645 --> 00:15:17.926]  And we're so broke back, we're laying there in the bed while they beat us with a coat hanger.
[00:15:17.926 --> 00:15:19.447]  While they knock our damn teeth out!
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.982]  So don't go along with this anymore!
[00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:24.243]  You've got a birthright!
[00:15:24.243 --> 00:15:26.285]  I told you it's not about me!
[00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:28.266]  I told you they were coming for you!
[00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:29.507]  And they are!
[00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:34.631]  They're coming for talk radio, they're coming for your children, they want it all because they crave it!
[00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:39.515]  And if you roll over to this group of psychos, you deserve what you get!
[00:15:39.515 --> 00:15:42.458]  They're a gang of crooks that hadn't been put in their place!
[00:15:43.757 --> 00:15:51.302]  They're a bunch of knuckle-dragging trash, like Hillary and Soros, that have gotten away with all sorts of crimes, and they think they're invincible!
[00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:53.143]  Well, they're not invincible!
[00:15:53.143 --> 00:15:55.864]  And God is gonna smash them into the ground!
[00:15:55.864 --> 00:15:56.785]  And destroy them!
[00:15:59.815 --> 00:16:01.016]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:06.399]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:09.300]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.882]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:03.846]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:05.609]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:16.882]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:26.828]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.828 --> 00:18:37.893]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.893 --> 00:18:40.515]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:42.235]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:47.058]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:18:47.278 --> 00:18:52.222]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.222 --> 00:18:54.865]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:59.589]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:08.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.061]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:14.764]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.764 --> 00:19:17.826]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[00:19:18.326 --> 00:19:20.007]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:20.007 --> 00:19:40.155]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:44.657]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:20:03.384 --> 00:20:06.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.704 --> 00:20:33.011]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:38.435]  I want to say something here and I want to be infinity clear.
[00:20:38.435 --> 00:20:43.818]  This country and this world is in a battle between good and evil.
[00:20:43.818 --> 00:20:45.339]  You got to choose a side.
[00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:50.042]  And evil is going into overdrive because it senses and is witnessing a global awakening.
[00:20:51.758 --> 00:21:01.764]  And it is critical that everybody be as active and focused as you can politically, spiritually, economically in the fight for freedom.
[00:21:01.764 --> 00:21:05.306]  Now is the time for peaceful, focused action.
[00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:10.729]  And if we do our part, God will deliver vengeance.
[00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.330]  Not us.
[00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.831]  We are not offensively going to do anything violent.
[00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.253]  But we are going to defend ourselves.
[00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:20.895]  And if they want a war, they're going to get one.
[00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:25.880]  But we are destroying them in the information war.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.941]  We are annihilating them.
[00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:32.723]  And making them bring out open censorship up front.
[00:21:32.723 --> 00:21:38.987]  With 800 plus major sites banned at the same time off Twitter and Facebook in the same hour.
[00:21:38.987 --> 00:21:42.589]  Total criminal coordination.
[00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:45.530]  And they didn't even say you broke rules or strikes.
[00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.733]  They said we consider your news to be conservative spam.
[00:21:50.908 --> 00:21:51.508]  Trash!
[00:21:51.508 --> 00:21:53.249]  Unwanted garbage!
[00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:54.870]  A total inversion!
[00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.571]  These are popular sites with millions of followers and hundreds of thousands of followers apiece.
[00:21:59.571 --> 00:22:03.093]  From respected conservative and libertarian and nationalist groups.
[00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:07.634]  And they're all gone!
[00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:16.258]  And that's so these monsters at CNN and MSNBC can say that Kanye West is like a minstrel actor.
[00:22:16.258 --> 00:22:18.879]  A white person in blackface making fun of black people.
[00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:23.112]  And that he is a dumb negro.
[00:22:23.112 --> 00:22:24.412]  This is what they're saying, not me.
[00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:26.932]  They'll probably edit and put this out.
[00:22:26.932 --> 00:22:32.694]  And that he's a puppet of Trump, a racist ventriloquist doll.
[00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:34.994]  I have all these clips.
[00:22:34.994 --> 00:22:38.955]  This is sick!
[00:22:38.955 --> 00:22:43.036]  This is Trump trying to have love, and Kanye trying to have love, and Mr. Brown trying to have love.
[00:22:44.244 --> 00:22:54.352]  And the establishment responds with the most sickening... There's articles on InfoWars.com that are incredible.
[00:22:54.352 --> 00:22:57.275]  Steve Watson has one that had so many examples this morning.
[00:22:57.275 --> 00:23:01.838]  Even though I didn't have time to spend 45 minutes on one article, I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:23:01.838 --> 00:23:02.059]  I did.
[00:23:03.024 --> 00:23:19.168]  I spent 45 minutes on this one article because there's dozens of tweets, seven or eight videos of the people saying the most horrible, nasty, racist crap I have ever heard in America.
[00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:25.910]  I mean, this is the stuff that you would hear out of the mouths of toothless KKK members.
[00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.870]  I mean, the worst.
[00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:34.762]  This is why they're so scared of this country coming back and us coming together.
[00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:54.394]  And Mr. Brown and Mr. West and Mr. Trump seriously working out plans and delivering massive factories and jobs and startups to black inner city areas and trying to develop plans to bring fathers back in the home and reverse the collapse of the black family, which is the opening salvo of taking all our families down.
[00:23:54.394 --> 00:23:57.796]  And it's admitted and they're doing it.
[00:23:57.796 --> 00:23:58.397]  Male energy.
[00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:15.819]  Jim Brown has spent, since he retired, whatever, 40 years ago, one of the greatest players ever, but he's really played on the field of life, spending his time, his money, actually trying to help youth, and trying to get fathers in people's lives.
[00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:22.483]  And there he is again doing it, and they call them all these horrible names, and stupid, and dumb.
[00:24:22.483 --> 00:24:24.905]  And oh, a woman once claimed he did something to her.
[00:24:24.905 --> 00:24:25.505]  Give me a break.
[00:24:28.888 --> 00:24:31.229]  It's unbelievable.
[00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:40.271]  For all the Democrats' money and all their propaganda and all their foreign funding, $38 million raised the last three months for Beto, who can hardly talk.
[00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:42.452]  He's another guy with a hit-and-run record, but that's okay.
[00:24:42.452 --> 00:24:44.053]  He's a Democrat.
[00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:45.233]  Raises $38 million.
[00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:49.054]  He wants to ban all assault rifles, all semi-autos in Texas.
[00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:51.015]  They're calling him the new Obama.
[00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:56.876]  They're hoping all this insane celebrity, oh, worshiping Beto, he'll remove Ted Cruz.
[00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.597]  Everyone in Texas, better vote.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:09.346]  And I'm not saying do what the Democrats do, look at the obituary and find somebody that died and go in there and vote in their name.
[00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:11.407]  Plus, in Texas, we have ID.
[00:25:11.407 --> 00:25:12.869]  Oh, so that doesn't work that way.
[00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:16.952]  See how that works?
[00:25:16.952 --> 00:25:18.773]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:18.773 --> 00:25:21.916]  So let's start getting to some of these clips.
[00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:23.677]  Which one should we play first?
[00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:27.981]  Let's play the clip where they talk about
[00:25:28.993 --> 00:25:30.514]  I mean, I can't even hardly get to these clips.
[00:25:30.514 --> 00:25:32.235]  Maybe I shouldn't even play this.
[00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:47.405]  Let's play the one where they talk about, this is what happens when Negroes don't... Which of the left, they've made that word Anglo-Negro, it just means like Negro in Spanish, or Latin, it just means, you know, like, you get the Mexican beer that's dark, it's, I want the Negro, I want the blonde.
[00:25:47.405 --> 00:25:48.005]  That's all that means.
[00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:51.688]  But the media's turned the word Negro into the N-word.
[00:25:52.628 --> 00:25:54.570]  And so they know what they're doing when they use it.
[00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:07.560]  I don't use it because a lot of ignorant people, especially ignorant white people, think it's the N-word.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.341]  So let's go to that clip.
[00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:09.982]  Here it is.
[00:26:09.982 --> 00:26:13.265]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:14.646]  And we have this now.
[00:26:14.646 --> 00:26:17.068]  And now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it.
[00:26:17.068 --> 00:26:19.310]  And he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.152]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[00:26:25.152 --> 00:26:30.737]  Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[00:26:30.737 --> 00:26:34.340]  They've had it with him, and he's an attention whore like the president.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.502]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[00:26:37.502 --> 00:26:41.245]  He's the token negro of the Trump administration.
[00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:44.968]  This is ridiculous, and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:46.990]  He clearly has issues.
[00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.631]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:49.892]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:54.703]  This is white supremacy by ventriloquism.
[00:26:54.703 --> 00:27:00.306]  A black mouth is moving, but white racist ideals are flowing from Kanye West's mouth.
[00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:04.669]  Kanye West is engaging in one of the most nefarious practices yet.
[00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:17.278]  A black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation and expression of anti-black sentiments that have been chin-checked by people with far more rigorous credentials.
[00:27:18.358 --> 00:27:20.080]  I mean, these are racepayers.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.622]  Who thinks that only white people can be racist?
[00:27:22.622 --> 00:27:24.243]  But it's beyond race.
[00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:28.267]  It's manipulation of people to keep us divided.
[00:27:28.267 --> 00:27:35.252]  And that's what these monsters... We have the memos from the last election where they said, go out and racially divide.
[00:27:35.252 --> 00:27:45.081]  Top psychological warfare professors, psychiatrists, who are on the Hillary campaign at the highest levels, are telling her, this is what you've got to do.
[00:27:47.564 --> 00:27:49.925]  Expand the culture wars.
[00:27:49.925 --> 00:27:55.188]  That means women against men, men against women, black against white, and everything they're doing.
[00:27:55.188 --> 00:27:58.570]  By the way, I said I'd announce this last night, and I didn't.
[00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.751]  Remind me at the end of the hour to do it, guys.
[00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:04.993]  I need like a whiteboard in here or something, so I don't forget.
[00:28:04.993 --> 00:28:08.435]  I didn't tell you the rest of the story the other day.
[00:28:08.435 --> 00:28:15.039]  I got so excited when I was breaking down that it's confirmed Hillary will be given the nomination, like she was three years ago.
[00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:26.625]  So it's simply absolutely mind-blowing that all of this is happening and unfolding, and it's going to get worse.
[00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:45.513]  Now coming up, we have Cuomo saying stuff even worse, that Trump was secretly thinking racist thoughts while he was looking at Jim Brown and looking at Kanye West and saying what a special, wonderful, courageous people they are for the courage they have.
[00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.992]  This is the level of deception in fake news.
[00:28:49.992 --> 00:28:50.853]  It's not even fake news.
[00:28:50.853 --> 00:28:56.216]  It's just raw, base, mindless propaganda that's meant to hype up their base to be violent.
[00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:01.891]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:02.992]  Get back to nature.

[00:29:55.249 --> 00:29:58.411]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[00:30:00.199 --> 00:30:07.890]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:08.370]  It's you!
[00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.656]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:30:11.656 --> 00:30:20.402]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:24.965]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:26.406]  You are the info war.
[00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:29.949]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:32.070]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:10.745]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:12.806]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:31:12.806 --> 00:31:15.667]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:17.168]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.168 --> 00:31:23.991]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:25.252]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:31:26.072 --> 00:31:35.780]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:52.613]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:55.756]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.896 --> 00:32:00.079]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:04.022]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:07.324]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:13.589]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:16.371]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:20.915]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.915 --> 00:32:27.382]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.382 --> 00:32:32.347]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.106 --> 00:32:37.029]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:44.214]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.214 --> 00:32:48.938]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:48.938 --> 00:32:55.143]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.143 --> 00:32:59.106]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.388 --> 00:33:16.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:24.793]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.793 --> 00:33:27.414]  25 days out and
[00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:39.801]  Facebook and Twitter and others have gotten even more bold than I thought they would in censorship.
[00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:44.984]  I predicted that as we got close to the election a year ago that you would see these purges and now you've seen it.
[00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:47.522]  800 just on Facebook.
[00:33:47.522 --> 00:33:54.284]  So when I said earlier 800, excuse me, numbers are now coming out as more groups announce they've been banned.
[00:33:54.284 --> 00:34:06.489]  It looks like it's about 1,600 major, major conservative libertarian Christian, pro-gun, pro-veteran, pro-life, just
[00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:12.952]  Just like Project Veritas got documents last year and got video, they said, what do you ban?
[00:34:12.952 --> 00:34:15.073]  They said, anything Alex Jones.
[00:34:15.073 --> 00:34:16.093]  He's our main enemy.
[00:34:16.093 --> 00:34:16.633]  Well, what else?
[00:34:16.633 --> 00:34:20.915]  Well, American flags and veterans.
[00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:21.676]  And, you know, scum.
[00:34:23.131 --> 00:34:33.594]  You know, I have talked to, over the years, Secret Service that told us Hillary was collapsing, and I said a month before she collapsed that she was collapsing and having seizures all the time, and that we should follow her, because we'd catch her falling down.
[00:34:33.594 --> 00:34:37.895]  And indeed, Millie Weaver caught her falling down behind a tent for an hour and a half.
[00:34:37.895 --> 00:34:39.075]  And then two weeks later, she collapsed.
[00:34:39.075 --> 00:34:41.676]  So my point is, these are real sources.
[00:34:41.676 --> 00:34:51.459]  And I have now confirmed from CIA details that protected her, Blackwater details that protected her, same thing,
[00:34:52.466 --> 00:34:59.412]  Secret Service, Federal Law Enforcement, you name it.
[00:34:59.412 --> 00:35:04.377]  And these are people that provide me photos of them with her.
[00:35:04.377 --> 00:35:08.761]  These are people that spent months, sometimes, overseas with her.
[00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:16.909]  She literally, in Situation Rooms, tells Generals and Colonels and people, you are stupid, you're in the military, do not look me in the eye!
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:21.761]  Behind the scenes, she is just literally... You think she looks like a demon in public?
[00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:27.384]  When she walks around like... She walks into rooms and goes, I am in command of this operation.
[00:35:27.384 --> 00:35:28.504]  Do as I say.
[00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:29.825]  Do not even look at me.
[00:35:29.825 --> 00:35:33.187]  Looking like this and people are just like, what the hell?
[00:35:33.187 --> 00:35:35.027]  Linda Blair.
[00:35:35.027 --> 00:35:42.151]  Other times she goes into a trance and like cocoons herself on a plane or in a car when they're driving somewhere and says, do not speak to me.
[00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:43.972]  And then goes into like some type of demon trance.
[00:35:45.549 --> 00:35:49.131]  And I've talked to person after person after person.
[00:35:49.131 --> 00:35:52.093]  They said she is demon possessed.
[00:35:52.093 --> 00:35:56.256]  And that's why I started saying that back during the campaign.
[00:35:56.256 --> 00:36:00.138]  Remember what FBI agents that worked in the White House went public from back in the 90s?
[00:36:00.138 --> 00:36:09.944]  They said Hillary would throw marble ashtrays at Clinton and him in the head and that she would get so mad that she would beat on the ground and chew the carpet.
[00:36:09.944 --> 00:36:11.225]  Hitler chewed the carpet.
[00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:20.212]  She gets on the ground and convulses satanically so bad that she chews the carpet.
[00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:21.853]  She hates dogs.
[00:36:21.853 --> 00:36:27.837]  They bring bomb dogs in, she goes, I told you I hate those filthy, disgusting animals!
[00:36:27.837 --> 00:36:29.318]  Get them out of here!
[00:36:29.318 --> 00:36:31.899]  And they're just like, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.
[00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:35.001]  Don't you look at me, you filthy military idiot!
[00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.691]  You are mentally retarded!
[00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:41.975]  I am an incredible intellect and a powerful woman!
[00:36:41.975 --> 00:36:49.260]  You will respect me!
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:55.144]  You cannot exaggerate the full demon force.
[00:36:55.144 --> 00:36:57.246]  She is Linda Blair.
[00:36:57.246 --> 00:37:00.909]  She was already co-president in four administrations.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:06.941]  Let me stop there.
[00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:10.163]  I said I'd get to all the censorship.
[00:37:10.163 --> 00:37:10.824]  And here's the thing.
[00:37:10.824 --> 00:37:13.946]  It's been said a trillion times that truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:37:13.946 --> 00:37:16.829]  It's real, folks.
[00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:17.770]  Mental illness.
[00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.151]  They call it demonic possession.
[00:37:19.151 --> 00:37:27.217]  People being taken over by stuff that acts like Linda Blair or Jack Nicholson and The Shining.
[00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:28.799]  That's what we're dealing with!
[00:37:30.854 --> 00:37:33.015]  She doesn't know what she looks like!
[00:37:33.015 --> 00:37:35.717]  She doesn't know how psychotic she looks!
[00:37:35.717 --> 00:37:38.118]  Because there's no one there!
[00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:47.524]  She is a husk!
[00:37:47.524 --> 00:37:48.925]  Alright, let me stop.
[00:37:48.925 --> 00:37:52.727]  In fact, she triggers me, as they say when they put her on screen.
[00:37:52.727 --> 00:37:54.648]  Remember, we're a radio show that's also syndicated on TV.
[00:37:54.648 --> 00:37:58.870]  If you're a radio listener and you go, why does he keep saying, keep saying, put her on screen, show this, show that?
[00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:59.791]  Those are radio slash TV.
[00:38:01.952 --> 00:38:06.016]  And without you, Infowars.com and Newshorse.com will be destroyed.
[00:38:06.016 --> 00:38:09.579]  And then you'll be destroyed, because as I said, they're going to go after everybody.
[00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:14.103]  So I'm going to get into the Jim Brown stuff and more of the censorship next segment.
[00:38:14.103 --> 00:38:22.430]  Let me just say now, before I forget to, because I should be doing this every segment, their number one goal is to destroy Infowars.
[00:38:23.393 --> 00:38:35.518]  Because we are putting out the reboot program of America, and Americana, and the spirit of resistance, and our spirit trumps their spirit by unlimited levels.
[00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:39.300]  And so when they hear this transmission, it's grating.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:46.803]  They want to have NPR voices, and, sleep, go to sleep, little chicken, as the snake coils around you.
[00:38:46.803 --> 00:38:47.864]  That's nice.
[00:38:47.864 --> 00:38:50.805]  Now, now, you don't want to get involved.
[00:38:50.805 --> 00:38:52.746]  Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.
[00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:56.793]  But now that's not working, so they're trying to intimidate everybody.
[00:38:56.793 --> 00:39:01.915]  And I really am enraged by their activities.
[00:39:01.915 --> 00:39:03.536]  Not, not, not cowed.
[00:39:03.536 --> 00:39:07.037]  And they are afraid.
[00:39:07.037 --> 00:39:11.378]  Because they want to bring us down, so I want to defeat them.
[00:39:11.378 --> 00:39:15.500]  And they understand, existentially, we have the capabilities.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.300]  We have the metal.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.101]  We have the political truth.
[00:39:19.101 --> 00:39:21.642]  We have the weapons, politically.
[00:39:21.642 --> 00:39:23.443]  We have the high ground, politically.
[00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:47.111]  Our quiver is filled with razor-sharp truths, and we have the great Bowman's confidence to destroy our political enemies instantly, if ever humanity awakens, and it's happening.
[00:39:47.111 --> 00:39:52.473]  And so it's a very magic time to be alive, but as I told you, and it's not hard to predict, but still, why are we putting up with it?
[00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:55.947]  Why is this unfolding?
[00:39:55.947 --> 00:39:58.789]  Why is this happening?
[00:39:58.789 --> 00:40:00.190]  Because it's a plan.
[00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.690]  Because we're at war.
[00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:07.794]  The globalists are stealing your birthright, taking over your family, and putting you into bondage.
[00:40:07.794 --> 00:40:09.715]  And the beta test was the black community.
[00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:14.918]  They are here to dominate you.
[00:40:14.918 --> 00:40:17.260]  They are taking control.
[00:40:19.525 --> 00:40:21.246]  So, I want to thank the listeners.
[00:40:21.246 --> 00:40:24.548]  You have been supporting us and you've been getting great products at the same time.
[00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:36.694]  It is so essential that everyone who hasn't tried the great supplements and the great products go to InfoWareStore.com and get award-winning, you know, hardcore politically incorrect t-shirts.
[00:40:36.694 --> 00:40:38.615]  All of it funds the operation.
[00:40:38.615 --> 00:40:43.018]  We have the biggest sale we've ever run, store-wide free shipping and 50% off
[00:40:45.499 --> 00:40:55.307]  All of the nutraceuticals, the fluoride-free toothpaste, 4-to-5-aclylsilver iodine, the Brain Force, the X2 that's already selling out last run, but you know what?
[00:40:55.307 --> 00:41:05.016]  They took PayPal, they're trying to take our other payment processors, and they're going to take all the other conservatives' payment processors, and they're going to ban anybody from being able to work or have a job that was in the NRA!
[00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:05.936]  They're announcing it all!
[00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:09.499]  It was on Fox News last night!
[00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:11.041]  You don't roll over to that, you fight it!
[00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:21.697]  So, you want to get your supplements and stock up, and get your Christmas gifts right now, because this is Christmas, this is Black Friday, and this is Cyber Monday, all rolled into one.
[00:41:21.697 --> 00:41:25.078]  And we'll have those specials, if we're even around then.
[00:41:25.078 --> 00:41:29.799]  But see, I don't see it as a bad thing for me, whatever happens to us, because they're coming for everyone.
[00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:31.140]  They're at war.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.800]  This is serious.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.161]  This isn't a game.
[00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:38.922]  So I'm broadcasting and transmitting as hard as I can, because we're actually winning hearts and minds.
[00:41:38.922 --> 00:41:41.303]  But the enemy has the rail lines,
[00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:46.686]  And the telephones, as Stalin said.
[00:41:46.686 --> 00:41:53.847]  That's why they're testing the internet kill switch that they transferred mainly to the UN and the EU and the Chinese three years ago.
[00:41:53.847 --> 00:41:55.888]  Two and a half years ago, right before Obama left.
[00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:57.828]  Yeah, you heard me right.
[00:41:57.828 --> 00:42:05.329]  But the head of Interpol was the number two civilian in the Chinese military who has all the databases of everybody?
[00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:08.510]  That is the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.770]  Interpol.
[00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:11.237]  Well, of course!
[00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:13.859]  Just like the Chi-Coms run Interpol.
[00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:17.241]  They now, with the EU and the UN, have control of ICANN.
[00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:26.348]  They were going to get full control, but now they've only got about 80% control, so they're going to test turning the Internet off tomorrow.
[00:42:26.348 --> 00:42:27.709]  You heard that right.
[00:42:27.709 --> 00:42:30.471]  See, it's not Trump that's getting ready to turn the Internet off.
[00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:32.032]  It's these people.
[00:42:32.032 --> 00:42:36.075]  They're getting ready to make a big move, and they're turning everybody's communications off right before they do it.
[00:42:36.075 --> 00:42:39.618]  So it's pretty obvious that this is the big assault.
[00:42:40.692 --> 00:42:42.634]  So, we need Congress with emergency injunctions.
[00:42:42.634 --> 00:42:44.596]  We need the President to take action now.
[00:42:44.596 --> 00:42:46.739]  They're not going to wait until after the election.
[00:42:46.739 --> 00:42:47.660]  They're making their move.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.244]  They've got terror teams loading trucks full of bombs right now.
[00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:52.866]  They might not even do false flags.
[00:42:52.866 --> 00:42:57.311]  They might go right to bombing every Republican governor and trying to kill the President in one fell swoop.
[00:42:59.585 --> 00:43:01.906]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:47:03.315 --> 00:47:05.997]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.813 --> 00:47:42.229]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:42.229 --> 00:47:46.493]  Welcome back to the most banned, most demonized, the platform program in the world.
[00:47:46.493 --> 00:47:48.195]  But hey, don't worry, we got lots of company.
[00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:51.190]  Thousands and thousands and thousands.
[00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.794]  It was 800 as of this morning in the Washington Post, but now thousands more are coming in.
[00:47:55.794 --> 00:47:58.756]  Some pages with a million followers, some with 300,000 followers.
[00:47:58.756 --> 00:48:03.179]  Michelle Malkin's page, anti-war liberal groups pages being banned.
[00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:07.122]  Anything really political that's real and popular is all being banned.
[00:48:07.122 --> 00:48:08.923]  Mainly conservatives and Christians.
[00:48:08.923 --> 00:48:11.645]  Facebook purges over 800 US accounts and pages.
[00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.811]  From pushing political spam.
[00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:17.673]  That's right, the Democrats can run around and say, kill and murder everybody.
[00:48:17.673 --> 00:48:22.576]  And Antifa can have pages run by professors organizing, trying to kill Republicans.
[00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:23.536]  That's all protected.
[00:48:23.536 --> 00:48:29.860]  Maxine Waters can get up there and say, hound them in restaurants, hound them at gasoline stations, hound them at the mall.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.722]  Don't let them rest, don't let them eat, don't let them do nothing!
[00:48:33.722 --> 00:48:39.626]  The former Attorney General says, when they go low, we go lower and start kicking them, kick them, kick them, fight, fight, fight!
[00:48:42.037 --> 00:48:49.662]  Facebook and Twitter banned popular independent media sites and coordinated purge InfoWars.com from InformationLiberation.com.
[00:48:49.662 --> 00:48:54.324]  And you're like, well, you've got your own website.
[00:48:54.324 --> 00:48:56.666]  Let me explain how the architecture works.
[00:48:56.666 --> 00:49:01.969]  15 years ago, 90 plus percent of the web was millions of popular sites, billions of other sites.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:06.431]  An endless island chain, an archipelago.
[00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.413]  Incredible diversity.
[00:49:08.413 --> 00:49:10.514]  Then everyone gets their own Facebook, their own Twitter.
[00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:22.698]  Other platforms, and then radio shows and TV shows, they all push to that and push their audiences off their websites onto those platforms.
[00:49:22.698 --> 00:49:24.159]  The platforms swell.
[00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:28.382]  Then they begin slowly censoring, curtailing, blocking, but only when they need to.
[00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:33.286]  Then they went from being arrogant to scared two years ago when Trump won, and so now,
[00:49:34.804 --> 00:49:39.828]  Twenty-five days out from the historic election, they're purging everybody.
[00:49:39.828 --> 00:49:42.610]  But see, now, they know how to titrate the poison dust.
[00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:47.434]  They build it up, build it up, build it up, till you start to kind of like the poison.
[00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:49.315]  First, oh, nobody's censoring.
[00:49:49.315 --> 00:49:51.077]  Oh, there's no conservative sites.
[00:49:51.077 --> 00:49:53.579]  Oh, well, Alex Jones is banned, but he's a hate monger.
[00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:56.161]  We're going to show you what he said, but oh, now it's spam.
[00:49:57.273 --> 00:50:03.834]  Now we consider it spam that you're posting articles and you have a political view.
[00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:07.055]  Only we're allowed to do that 25 days out.
[00:50:07.055 --> 00:50:08.315]  Oh, and it was 800 yesterday?
[00:50:08.315 --> 00:50:09.715]  How about a few more thousands today?
[00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:12.536]  And then it's just kind of, okay, everybody's banned.
[00:50:12.536 --> 00:50:18.777]  Then they call in Facebook and Twitter execs just a month ago and they're like, no, we don't ban anybody if they're conservative.
[00:50:18.777 --> 00:50:20.857]  We only ban people that are violent or hateful.
[00:50:20.857 --> 00:50:24.458]  And now it's, oh, and spam, which is totally arbitrary to what we want.
[00:50:26.943 --> 00:50:29.264]  Because Congress has not acted!
[00:50:29.264 --> 00:50:35.905]  Because Congress is citizen, and Google moved to China, helping their military build AI, won't work with our military, using U.S.
[00:50:35.905 --> 00:50:41.526]  government funding that started Google, In-Q-Tel, the Geospatial Center, and why not?
[00:50:41.526 --> 00:50:53.149]  See, Trump's the president, but Obama and Hillary have their whole network in place, and they've got their executive orders in place from a civil emergency that Trump hasn't revoked, and so they're just sitting there, what?
[00:50:53.149 --> 00:50:53.769]  We don't exist!
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.841]  Trump's done a few things to get the economy going, but they've blocked 90% of what he wants to do.
[00:50:58.841 --> 00:51:05.962]  And then, oh, when he says there's media censorship of conservatives, why, he's attacking the press.
[00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:09.743]  No, they're the ones attacking the press.
[00:51:09.743 --> 00:51:11.623]  So what are you going to do?
[00:51:11.623 --> 00:51:13.804]  What are we going to do?
[00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:20.885]  Because we're at war with China, politically and economically, and we have traitors in our government, in our corporations, that are openly
[00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:24.465]  Crapping on us and rubbing it in.
[00:51:24.465 --> 00:51:25.946]  That are stealing our birthright.
[00:51:25.946 --> 00:51:39.735]  And in school education and school programming, everywhere, I'm going to cover this when we come back, they're targeting children with the agenda to not have children and to break up the family.
[00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:42.257]  And that's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the documents, it's in the psychology.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:57.863]  With, quote, sex education and tolerance training, where they take four-year-olds up, three-year-olds up, as a obese man in a wig shakes their butt in their face, and they stick five-dollar bills in their panty line.
[00:51:57.863 --> 00:52:07.246]  And now, this is out of the Daily Mail, gay penguins named Sven and Magic are set to raise their first chick at Requarium Step.
[00:52:07.246 --> 00:52:10.086]  Notice the pair were more than just friends.
[00:52:10.086 --> 00:52:12.127]  So, they see the penguins hanging out.
[00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:21.525]  So they go give them an egg, and then male birds, especially penguins if no one else is around, and some species will take care of eggs.
[00:52:21.525 --> 00:52:24.626]  And so that means they're gay!
[00:52:24.626 --> 00:52:28.588]  Just like men in England, nurses get fired if they don't come in.
[00:52:28.588 --> 00:52:32.529]  One nurse said he had very large genitals and tattoos and a beard.
[00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:35.871]  He got up in the stirrups and said, I want you to give me a pap smear.
[00:52:36.997 --> 00:52:40.178]  She was suspended when she said, you, sir, are a male.
[00:52:40.178 --> 00:52:41.159]  You don't have a cervix.
[00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:43.800]  And then the hospital went, no, he does.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:52.684]  So if I said maybe I was a penguin and he did my beak trimmed and I go in to a dental office and I say, uh, sir, I'm a penguin.
[00:52:52.684 --> 00:52:54.065]  Will you trim my beak?
[00:52:54.065 --> 00:52:56.326]  Or maybe I'm a, maybe I'm a chicken.
[00:52:56.326 --> 00:52:58.227]  Will you pluck my feathers?
[00:52:58.227 --> 00:53:00.048]  You don't go to a mental institution.
[00:53:00.048 --> 00:53:00.728]  Oh no.
[00:53:00.728 --> 00:53:01.308]  Yes, sir.
[00:53:01.308 --> 00:53:03.929]  Let's let me pluck your feathers out for you here.
[00:53:03.929 --> 00:53:05.050]  Let me preen your feathers.
[00:53:07.222 --> 00:53:17.727]  This is total war, and you take children who expect adults to give them real leadership and real direction, and you put them in these schools and these systems, and you teach little boys that are five years old, you're really a girl?
[00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:21.169]  And you're really a boy to a girl, or you can dress however you want?
[00:53:21.169 --> 00:53:22.730]  You are screwing them up!
[00:53:23.922 --> 00:53:34.269]  You are taking the existing order of mammal species and everything that is sacred and real, and you are irrevocably molesting their minds.
[00:53:34.269 --> 00:53:35.550]  You are raping their brains.
[00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.133]  You are turning them into mental patients!
[00:53:39.133 --> 00:53:42.015]  And that's the other big thing you're not supposed to talk about.
[00:53:42.015 --> 00:53:43.756]  That's the other big third rail.
[00:53:43.756 --> 00:53:47.458]  Jones, don't talk about radical Islam.
[00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:48.559]  Jones?
[00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:49.560]  Jones?
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.402]  Don't talk about transgenderism targeting children.
[00:53:53.976 --> 00:53:58.558]  And, Jones, don't talk about Communist China and Internet censorship.
[00:53:58.558 --> 00:54:00.119]  Shut up!
[00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:01.219]  Shut up!
[00:54:01.219 --> 00:54:03.760]  And they told everybody, you shut up or you'll be banned like him.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.921]  Then they didn't shut up.
[00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:06.581]  They go, okay, we'll just ban all of you.
[00:54:06.581 --> 00:54:07.502]  How do you like that?
[00:54:07.502 --> 00:54:08.802]  Well, hell.
[00:54:08.802 --> 00:54:09.803]  Last night, I'm up here late.
[00:54:09.803 --> 00:54:12.524]  Fox News is on during our own broadcast and I see Tucker Carlson reporting.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:13.980]  I think?
[00:54:32.884 --> 00:54:42.447]  Los Angeles, if you're a member of the NRA, and you're involved in contracting with the government, you must declare it in your contract, or it's fraud, and then we're not going to give you contracts.
[00:54:42.447 --> 00:54:48.729]  So, they're now saying, if you are a gun owner, and you're politically involved, you are banned from contracting.
[00:54:48.729 --> 00:54:50.189]  You are banned from the marketplace.
[00:54:50.189 --> 00:54:51.950]  That's totally illegal!
[00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:52.690]  Oh no!
[00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:55.571]  We're allowed to discriminate for political purposes.
[00:54:55.571 --> 00:54:58.012]  These people are out of control.
[00:54:58.012 --> 00:54:59.032]  There it is, Tucker Carlson.
[00:54:59.032 --> 00:54:59.712]  New LA law.
[00:54:59.712 --> 00:55:01.753]  Will NRA members be allowed to work in Los Angeles?
[00:55:02.645 --> 00:55:03.486]  It's beyond working.
[00:55:03.486 --> 00:55:05.727]  It's getting contracts.
[00:55:05.727 --> 00:55:06.508]  See how it starts?
[00:55:06.508 --> 00:55:07.789]  Remember when they took me off LinkedIn?
[00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:10.671]  And now they're taking other people, other conservatives off LinkedIn.
[00:55:10.671 --> 00:55:17.255]  And Google in California listed all Republicans as in the Nazi Party.
[00:55:17.255 --> 00:55:18.816]  Oh, but there's no political bias.
[00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.037]  They're making their move.
[00:55:20.037 --> 00:55:21.378]  We're at war.
[00:55:21.378 --> 00:55:25.881]  And the number one tactic of a real war is you don't tell somebody that they're attacking.
[00:55:25.881 --> 00:55:26.822]  You just run over them.
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:36.025]  And as tanks roll over you, they have loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault, we are your friends, lay down your weapons, because a certain percentage will lay them down and go, I give up!
[00:55:36.025 --> 00:55:37.205]  And then you shoot them.
[00:55:37.205 --> 00:55:38.927]  People go, you idiot!
[00:55:38.927 --> 00:55:40.387]  No, they're friends!
[00:55:40.387 --> 00:55:45.971]  Once they buy into the Nigerian email scam, once you buy into the Democrat scam, once you buy into the broadcast...
[00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:55.910]  When the Delta Force was killing the Davidians in Waco, driving in with a tank and shooting them to get rid of them as payback, they had loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault.
[00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:56.910]  This is not an assault.
[00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:57.931]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:03.692]  And many came out with their hands up and were shot and then bulldozed back in and gasoline poured on them.
[00:56:03.692 --> 00:56:06.573]  I know the guys that did it!
[00:56:06.573 --> 00:56:10.314]  So, this is how the world really works.
[00:56:10.314 --> 00:56:12.174]  This is what really goes on.
[00:56:12.174 --> 00:56:14.255]  Stop being childlike.
[00:56:14.255 --> 00:56:14.975]  We are not assaulting.
[00:56:14.975 --> 00:56:15.755]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:56:17.037 --> 00:56:23.278]  Infantry on both sides of the back of the tank shooting the people as they come out, and then bulldozing them into the fire.
[00:56:23.278 --> 00:56:30.659]  And even though you see people being shot, you still want to get out of the fire, so you run out and they shoot you.
[00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:31.660]  This is not an assault.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.640]  This is not an assault.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.720]  No one's censoring you.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.660]  No one's censoring you.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.600]  Trump's a Nazi.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.781]  Kanye West is a Nazi.
[00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:41.041]  Jim Brown is a Nazi.
[00:56:41.041 --> 00:56:44.082]  And you let these con artists sit there with Hillary's demon smile,
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:49.703]  Hi, I'm Hillary with Eric Schmidt.
[00:56:49.703 --> 00:56:50.463]  We love you.
[00:56:50.463 --> 00:56:53.203]  Yeah.
[00:56:53.203 --> 00:56:54.944]  They should all be arrested.
[00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.284]  They sold out to China.
[00:56:56.284 --> 00:56:57.784]  We're in World War 4.
[00:56:57.784 --> 00:57:02.405]  These are infiltrators, for God's sakes.
[00:57:02.405 --> 00:57:03.825]  I want to thank God when we come back in the next hour.
[00:57:03.825 --> 00:57:08.026]  I got some really important news yesterday, and I just praise God for all your prayers and all your support.
[00:57:08.026 --> 00:57:10.247]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:57:10.247 --> 00:57:12.307]  They're trying to financially shut us down, as you know.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:19.224]  And we need to then sell out of all the product we have unless, in case they get our last processor.
[00:57:19.224 --> 00:57:21.666]  And, you know, I just have to give you that news.
[00:57:21.666 --> 00:57:24.447]  It looks like we've got some more, but we're under mafia attack.
[00:57:24.447 --> 00:57:26.169]  They're going after everybody else now.
[00:57:26.169 --> 00:57:31.132]  So you need to get the products so we can be provisioned into next year with the funds we need.
[00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:32.373]  Everyone must act now.
[00:57:32.373 --> 00:57:35.795]  Go to m4store.com, free shipping storewide, 50% off on all the supplements.
[00:57:36.175 --> 00:57:37.297]  Huge discounts on everything else.
[00:57:37.297 --> 00:57:39.240]  Get t-shirts, get books while you still can.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.365]  This is part of history in Americana and we need to be provisioned.
[00:57:42.365 --> 00:57:45.470]  We will continue to fight to the end, but I need provisions.
[00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.333]  I need information warfare ammo.
[00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.136]  I need refueling to get back in the field!
[00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.291]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:55.872]  And Survival Psyllid X2 is the pure iodine.
[00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.753]  No one else has this from deep earth.
[00:57:57.753 --> 00:57:59.814]  Crystals between 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[00:57:59.814 --> 00:58:01.295]  It's very hard for me to get.
[00:58:01.295 --> 00:58:03.175]  It's the good halogen.
[00:58:03.175 --> 00:58:05.316]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[00:58:05.316 --> 00:58:11.839]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:14.440]  Bio-True Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.861]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[00:58:17.181 --> 00:58:22.882]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[00:58:22.882 --> 00:58:24.683]  So these go incredibly well together.
[00:58:24.683 --> 00:58:26.243]  We have a combo of those.
[00:58:26.243 --> 00:58:27.624]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:58:27.624 --> 00:58:30.344]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[00:58:30.344 --> 00:58:31.384]  Very simple stuff.
[00:58:31.384 --> 00:58:33.025]  Filter your water.
[00:58:33.025 --> 00:58:35.105]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[00:58:35.105 --> 00:58:36.686]  Best out there for the price.
[00:58:36.686 --> 00:58:37.646]  When I say it's the last run,
[00:58:39.017 --> 00:58:40.458]  It could be six months, a year, until we get more.
[00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:41.298]  I hope we get more.
[00:58:41.298 --> 00:58:42.598]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[00:58:42.598 --> 00:58:45.059]  Survival Store next to it.
[00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:50.521]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:58:50.521 --> 00:58:52.882]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:58:52.882 --> 00:58:59.464]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA, too.
[00:58:59.464 --> 00:59:06.847]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[00:59:07.287 --> 00:59:16.930]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:28.414]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[00:59:28.914 --> 00:59:38.760]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.082]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[00:59:43.082 --> 00:59:52.908]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:52.908 --> 00:59:55.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:23.224]  I say a lot of important stuff, obviously.
[01:00:23.224 --> 01:00:24.926]  We're in very important times we're in.
[01:00:24.926 --> 01:00:26.969]  It's not hard.
[01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:27.910]  We're in profound times.
[01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:31.354]  And when we start the next segment, there's something that's really been pressing on me.
[01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:37.762]  A, we've got to seek God's face and discernment, God's mind.
[01:00:37.762 --> 01:00:39.103]  And we also have to
[01:00:41.457 --> 01:00:43.758]  Obviously, humble yourself to do that.
[01:00:43.758 --> 01:00:44.918]  And it's a chicken or the egg thing.
[01:00:44.918 --> 01:00:55.943]  You come into God's presence, you obviously are going to feel pathetic at one level and very small and very bad because of how good, powerful and clean the Spirit is.
[01:00:55.943 --> 01:00:58.464]  But then you also feel better and closer to God.
[01:00:58.464 --> 01:01:07.467]  And then you begin to just enter the mind of God just a little bit and can see the completion and the total mastery.
[01:01:07.467 --> 01:01:08.568]  And the timelessness
[01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:16.697]  And the desire to be with that forever.
[01:01:16.697 --> 01:01:22.838]  Now, the enemy does not like that spirit, obviously.
[01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:25.019]  It's all about how powerful it is.
[01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:29.360]  It's very infantile, to say the least.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.421]  But I also want to just point this out when we come back.
[01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:34.361]  We are not in normal times.
[01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:36.082]  And the biggest problem facing us
[01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:57.963]  Is the fact that even Trump is projecting too much of himself onto the situation because he wouldn't do the kind of things they're coming up with.
[01:01:57.963 --> 01:02:01.405]  And you have to get into the enemy's mind.
[01:02:01.405 --> 01:02:05.528]  And so just as you have to seek God's mind, I have
[01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:13.948]  sought to not be possessed by, but interface with evil.
[01:02:13.948 --> 01:02:23.333]  Especially when I was younger, I didn't really do it on purpose, but I have definitely interfaced with really, really bad stuff.
[01:02:23.333 --> 01:02:27.655]  And not a lot of folks interface with that and never come back.
[01:02:27.655 --> 01:02:32.277]  So the enemy particularly doesn't like me because I have swam in very deep, dark waters.
[01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:47.620]  And obviously the enemy could project forward to the future and was trying to attach itself to me very early on, but I escaped it through God's grace and through my ancestors that prayed for future generations very intensely.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:03:00.024]  And so that great reservoir, that reserve of very good people is the only reason I'm here through God's grace.
[01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:07.802]  My mom's mom told me things I already knew, but real mysteries.
[01:03:07.802 --> 01:03:12.925]  Real mysteries of people that really serve God and that founded this country.
[01:03:12.925 --> 01:03:14.566]  They don't have to meet in secret societies.
[01:03:14.566 --> 01:03:17.128]  They don't have to go around in black cloaks.
[01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:18.109]  It's not that.
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:19.890]  They're close to God and it's like...
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.701]  Everybody's connected and we know and it's powerful.
[01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:39.563]  And when the enemy presses their pure evil, that's when it activates and it's a chain from us now into the past and our ancestors and then into the future.
[01:03:39.563 --> 01:03:41.804]  And it's electrical.
[01:03:41.804 --> 01:03:48.565]  So you physically touch your most ancient ancestor through your mother, your father down the line.
[01:03:49.386 --> 01:03:55.329]  That's why the enemy wants to break that with artificial humanoids, artificial biologicals.
[01:03:55.329 --> 01:04:00.192]  But it's been documented that they're always aggressive, evil, soulless.
[01:04:00.192 --> 01:04:02.133]  But that's why they want five fathers, five mothers.
[01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:03.154]  These aren't going to be humans.
[01:04:03.988 --> 01:04:13.330]  So the whole transhumanist movement goes into the world of you won't be able to criticize things that are made by companies and laboratories and factories.
[01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:20.532]  And all these movies about replicants and oh they're poor things and we need to be nice to the genetically engineered creatures and you know they're better than us.
[01:04:20.532 --> 01:04:28.994]  They're all preparing you for the robots and the synthetics and the biological androids to have supremacy over us.
[01:04:30.236 --> 01:04:39.099]  But to do that, they've got to stunt us and poison us and sterilize us so that we need to use them like a cane.
[01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:43.460]  And I mean, you know, the Tinker Toys they show you from Boston Dynamics that can now climb up the ceiling.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.921]  You can see how it's exponentially getting more dangerous.
[01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:48.262]  And these armies will follow orders.
[01:04:48.262 --> 01:04:54.664]  And just like calculators remove humans' ability to do math, this will make all of our manhood vestigial.
[01:04:54.664 --> 01:04:56.645]  So manhood's being removed because we're being spiked.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.283]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.283 --> 01:05:09.329]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:14.153]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:05:14.153 --> 01:05:22.039]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide
[01:05:23.661 --> 01:05:37.073]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:05:37.073 --> 01:05:44.160]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:57.285]  Head to infowarsstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today!
[01:06:09.317 --> 01:06:14.166]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:19.075]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:40.503]  Well, here we are, second hour, kicking it off.
[01:06:40.503 --> 01:06:45.225]  I'm going to give the number out, so you're taking your calls at the bottom of the hour throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[01:06:45.225 --> 01:06:49.207]  And here's the big announcement.
[01:06:49.207 --> 01:06:53.669]  On multiple fronts.
[01:06:53.669 --> 01:06:59.392]  I know who's running for president of the Democratic Party, and I know who's already been given the nomination just like three years ago.
[01:06:59.392 --> 01:07:01.413]  And I know who Hillary's running mate is.
[01:07:03.044 --> 01:07:08.968]  So, I said I'd get to it last night, didn't, said I'd get to it last hour, didn't, so I'm gonna get to it right now.
[01:07:08.968 --> 01:07:19.396]  I have been told by the Secret Service, and I have been told by the CIA, and I have been told by people at Blackwater, and I have been told by people in the Democratic Party.
[01:07:19.396 --> 01:07:26.902]  But I have been told by people that have been there, at the houses, at the meeting halls, at the facilities, the ticket now is not Joe Biden.
[01:07:29.229 --> 01:07:35.991]  The ticket is Hillary Clinton because she owns the Democratic Party with George Soros.
[01:07:35.991 --> 01:07:40.792]  And you've heard rumors of this and you've seen even Democrat newspapers say, well, she's looking at it and they're saying, please don't.
[01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:41.493]  She doesn't care.
[01:07:41.493 --> 01:07:42.453]  She does what she wants.
[01:07:42.453 --> 01:07:44.093]  She's tone deaf.
[01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.754]  She's a power man.
[01:07:45.754 --> 01:07:48.435]  But guess who's going to run with her?
[01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:53.076]  They've already announced that Michelle Obama is looking to run right now.
[01:07:54.465 --> 01:08:01.888]  They are looking at another co-presidency, it's the way these power groups do it, where it was Bill and Hillary for two terms, then Hillary and Obama for two terms.
[01:08:01.888 --> 01:08:05.109]  She's been president, co-president, even liberals admit that.
[01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:10.611]  They even call her Mrs. President, Madam President, in the emails, going back years ago.
[01:08:10.611 --> 01:08:13.452]  People say, why do they call her the president?
[01:08:13.452 --> 01:08:15.193]  Because she's been the president, co-president.
[01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:23.222]  That she will then be able to serve, she believes, six terms.
[01:08:23.222 --> 01:08:26.687]  Six terms.
[01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:29.070]  Hillary and Michelle Obama.
[01:08:31.932 --> 01:08:35.433]  I've been given this by the CIA.
[01:08:35.433 --> 01:08:37.493]  And I mean real people in the CIA.
[01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:44.374]  Not leftist pencil pushers and, you know, academics that all have a little card in their wallet so they can act tough and cool.
[01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:48.315]  You know, like the people they have testifying before Congress and making up lies.
[01:08:48.315 --> 01:08:50.955]  We're talking about the real people that are there.
[01:08:50.955 --> 01:08:54.676]  And CENTCOM, whole nine yards, it's done.
[01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:55.976]  Democrats are being told this is it.
[01:08:55.976 --> 01:08:58.617]  And you're like, wow, that doesn't sound very Democratic.
[01:08:58.617 --> 01:09:00.917]  Sanders won all the first primaries and won California.
[01:09:02.383 --> 01:09:04.104]  They gave the delegates to Hillary, remember?
[01:09:04.104 --> 01:09:08.607]  They tried to do that against Trump, but we didn't stand for it.
[01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:12.509]  We didn't go along with it.
[01:09:12.509 --> 01:09:15.411]  We would not bow down to this.
[01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:16.232]  And so, it's done.
[01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:18.893]  Now, that sounds insane.
[01:09:18.893 --> 01:09:25.197]  It's all about divisional politics, and everything is about dividing men and women, and families.
[01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:28.599]  And so the same job they did on the black community in the last 50 years is already being done to everybody else.
[01:09:32.588 --> 01:09:35.831]  They're going to run the corpse.
[01:09:35.831 --> 01:09:38.354]  The brain in the bubbling jar.
[01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:42.538]  Like Matt Drudge said a decade ago.
[01:09:42.538 --> 01:09:48.965]  And just like Roosevelt was in a wheelchair and super sick, but he was still the president, their belief is it doesn't matter.
[01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:50.166]  She can be in a wheelchair.
[01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:51.387]  They'll just say she isn't.
[01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.428]  You'll all see the wheelchair.
[01:09:52.428 --> 01:09:54.791]  And they'll say, well, that's not a wheelchair.
[01:09:56.069 --> 01:09:58.430]  Remember she fell down on her face and they said she didn't fall down.
[01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.451]  Alex Jones is fake news.
[01:10:00.451 --> 01:10:03.113]  MSNBC actually said Alex Jones is fake news.
[01:10:03.113 --> 01:10:08.616]  Look, she only stumbled and they cut off her falling on her face and being picked up and put in the vehicle.
[01:10:08.616 --> 01:10:18.581]  Having a convulsion.
[01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.082]  So you think about that long and hard.
[01:10:21.082 --> 01:10:21.923]  That's what's about to happen.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.442]  And you say, well no one will put up with that.
[01:10:25.442 --> 01:10:32.790]  They're killing now, not just tens of thousands of conservative sites the last few months, and thousands in the last day.
[01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.292]  That's the big news on Infowars.com.
[01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.414]  Or we're just used to it now.
[01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:40.458]  See, Congress doesn't act, so we get worse.
[01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:45.102]  They're purging all of the real liberal sites that are socially liberal on some issues, tolerant.
[01:10:46.015 --> 01:10:47.495]  But they're anti-war.
[01:10:47.495 --> 01:10:50.936]  I looked at the list, and some of these have millions of followers.
[01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:52.236]  300,000 followers.
[01:10:52.236 --> 01:10:52.656]  800,000 followers.
[01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:54.157]  Dan Dix, the filmmaker, you name it.
[01:10:54.157 --> 01:10:57.357]  They're all being banned, too.
[01:10:57.357 --> 01:11:02.138]  Because they actually report objectively.
[01:11:02.138 --> 01:11:04.979]  And they have followings, and the establishment doesn't like that.
[01:11:04.979 --> 01:11:06.219]  They want full control.
[01:11:06.219 --> 01:11:09.359]  And so, Alex Jones was a test case.
[01:11:09.359 --> 01:11:11.920]  Chewing, lie about him, demonizing for years.
[01:11:13.277 --> 01:11:36.312]  Hundreds of thousands of articles, literally, thousands of TV programs, dozens of TV shows, Homeland, based on Alex Jones, Ramen Evil, Criminal, Comedy Central shows, all of it, to turn me into a demon in the eyes of the public, so that I could then be destroyed, which we're in the process of doing here, so that we're all taught how it's done,
[01:11:37.671 --> 01:11:38.871]  And I'm the test case.
[01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:39.972]  I'm the test pilot.
[01:11:39.972 --> 01:11:54.757]  See, just like I'm the test pilot for bringing out the hardcore ideas that are real, that no one else has the courage to do, and I put myself in this position and proven I know what I'm doing, and so I'm here and I'm willing to do it because somebody's got to volunteer.
[01:11:54.757 --> 01:11:56.598]  I'm not saying I'm a hero here.
[01:11:56.598 --> 01:11:59.439]  We have no future if we don't do it.
[01:11:59.439 --> 01:12:06.542]  I mean, I use the cheesy Wrath of Khan analogy that the big Genesis bomb's about to go off.
[01:12:07.341 --> 01:12:18.889]  And it's going to kill everybody on both ships, because Khan's dying and he wants to kill Captain Kirk and the Enterprise, and Spock goes down in the reactor and fixes the ship, because everybody's going to die if he doesn't.
[01:12:18.889 --> 01:12:22.251]  It's either everybody dies, or I die.
[01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:25.794]  Now, if more of us acted like that, I wouldn't have to die.
[01:12:25.794 --> 01:12:33.419]  But I'll tell you right now, when I talk about death, I mean my name, my treasure, everything.
[01:12:33.419 --> 01:12:35.321]  Because we lose everything anyways.
[01:12:36.237 --> 01:12:37.717]  There's not even a thought in my mind.
[01:12:37.717 --> 01:12:39.018]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:41.878]  I'm extremely honored.
[01:12:41.878 --> 01:12:45.699]  Because when you behave like that, that's when God opens the doors.
[01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:49.800]  And that's when providence raises its beautiful face.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.361]  And that's when you get closer to God, and that's what's valuable.
[01:12:53.361 --> 01:12:55.301]  Not money, not power, no.
[01:12:55.301 --> 01:12:58.922]  Money, power, that's all to be used judiciously to help people.
[01:12:58.922 --> 01:13:05.664]  Money is only fuel to build a civilization, not to sit back with a bunch of bling.
[01:13:07.096 --> 01:13:10.477]  And there's nothing wrong with bling if it isn't your God.
[01:13:10.477 --> 01:13:14.598]  It's okay to celebrate God's providence and success, but it's not your God.
[01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.438]  And you don't sell out for it.
[01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:20.259]  When you don't sell out, you get all the wealth and all the power.
[01:13:20.259 --> 01:13:27.301]  When you do sell out, you end up losing your children and your whole world and your whole life.
[01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:30.642]  And there's a spirit of evil being poured out in the world right now.
[01:13:30.642 --> 01:13:36.423]  And there are people resonating with the evil spiritually, and there are people who are interfacing with true evil.
[01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:39.390]  The devil's working overtime.
[01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:43.592]  It's real.
[01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:47.293]  Everybody knows it.
[01:13:47.293 --> 01:13:52.214]  And we're not in normal times.
[01:13:52.214 --> 01:13:54.435]  We're not in normal times.
[01:13:54.435 --> 01:13:56.456]  And that's one of Trump's only problems.
[01:13:56.456 --> 01:13:58.616]  And my problem too.
[01:13:58.616 --> 01:14:03.978]  We get so set in the daily routine and we get used to the left's violence and their threats and all the horrible things they do.
[01:14:07.847 --> 01:14:17.231]  And then we just kind of adapt to being abused, and then when they hit us with the full dose, when they finally ramp it up, which they're doing, I think they're going to attack the next 25 days.
[01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:19.132]  Unless we get the word out and stop them.
[01:14:19.132 --> 01:14:28.315]  I don't think, I know, you see the mass bomber that admits he was going to blow up the mall with 200 pounds of explosives and kill potentially thousands of people, and he's a big leftist, the media covers that up.
[01:14:28.315 --> 01:14:37.439]  They're activating, through the propaganda, through the brainwashing, through the media, the most manipulatable, suggestible people.
[01:14:38.817 --> 01:14:42.479]  That are now being pushed to go out and be violent and to target.
[01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:44.060]  Just like advertising.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:48.963]  They know they put a certain beer commercial on, they're gonna sell X amount of beer to this group.
[01:14:48.963 --> 01:14:57.068]  Well, you go out and say the Republicans or Nazis kill them or everybody's gonna die, and you see authority figures saying that on every channel, and the president's a white supremacist.
[01:14:58.206 --> 01:15:03.712]  You're gonna have people try to blow the White House up when Madonna's saying, I think a lot about blowing the White House up.
[01:15:03.712 --> 01:15:13.882]  Why do you think they're all up there every day saying, kill, kill, kill, and then lying about me and saying I'm saying go out and kill them with no proof, is to then add, oh look, Jones says he's coming to kill you!
[01:15:13.882 --> 01:15:18.067]  So they go, well I'm not gonna put up with that, I'm gonna kill you!
[01:15:23.305 --> 01:15:30.372]  You know how bold it is when every major news channel in the country, National News said, Jones said, get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[01:15:30.372 --> 01:15:31.734]  No clip, no nothing!
[01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:33.315]  That's war propaganda, man!
[01:15:33.315 --> 01:15:35.598]  That means they're going for broke, baby!
[01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:38.200]  You think I'm worried about my office and me?
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.082]  I'm worried about the whole world, baby!
[01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:41.644]  They're coming for everybody!
[01:15:41.644 --> 01:15:43.205]  It ain't just Alex Jones!
[01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.187]  This is the big final globalist assault!
[01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:51.021]  And the Pentagon, and the military, and the police, and the public, everybody better get ready!
[01:15:51.021 --> 01:15:52.865]  Because this is the big one, people!
[01:15:52.865 --> 01:15:54.269]  They're coming over the top!
[01:15:54.269 --> 01:15:55.231]  Fix bayonets!
[01:15:57.734 --> 01:15:58.955]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:04.319]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.319 --> 01:16:07.221]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.221 --> 01:16:10.803]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:16:27.307 --> 01:16:33.656]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.701]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.701 --> 01:16:42.269]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.609 --> 01:16:46.412]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.412 --> 01:16:47.673]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.673 --> 01:16:48.674]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.674 --> 01:16:55.219]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.219 --> 01:16:57.341]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:59.783]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?

[01:18:58.087 --> 01:19:01.970]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.317 --> 01:19:12.019]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.019 --> 01:19:13.980]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.441]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:20.061]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.061 --> 01:19:22.342]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:29.304]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:29.844 --> 01:19:39.648]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.648 --> 01:19:40.828]  We'll win.

[01:19:50.892 --> 01:19:54.573]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[01:19:54.573 --> 01:19:56.133]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:56.994]  We need your support.
[01:19:56.994 --> 01:19:57.554]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:01.698 --> 01:20:18.571]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:21.774]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[01:20:21.774 --> 01:20:25.177]  A little secret that nobody knows.
[01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:32.913]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:37.715]  You're listening to the most banned, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world by the Chi-Coms.
[01:20:37.715 --> 01:20:43.538]  Their media openly attacks me, calls me to be shut down, by the Hollywood trash, by the entire establishment.
[01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:50.701]  I'm a loyal American, and I'm loyal to the Bill of Rights Constitution and to our open, free society that's under attack.
[01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:53.502]  And a lot of powerful elites sold our country out.
[01:20:53.502 --> 01:20:54.803]  They parlayed it into global government.
[01:20:56.511 --> 01:21:00.874]  And if they were building a world government of peace and freedom, I'd still be worried about it, because a dictator could take that over.
[01:21:00.874 --> 01:21:05.237]  It's authoritarian, but out of the gates it's anti-family, anti-human.
[01:21:05.237 --> 01:21:10.481]  It wants full control over the life process, the life cycle.
[01:21:10.481 --> 01:21:15.505]  Everything is targeting our fertility, our health.
[01:21:15.505 --> 01:21:17.346]  We are under globalist attack.
[01:21:17.346 --> 01:21:22.950]  And Trump represents a pro-human future and a human future.
[01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.892]  And that's why they see him as an archaic,
[01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:29.499]  Bumbling booby.
[01:21:29.499 --> 01:21:33.322]  They know they could do the same things Trump's done and turn the economy on.
[01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.743]  They don't want that.
[01:21:34.743 --> 01:21:36.504]  They want you poor under their control.
[01:21:36.504 --> 01:21:37.865]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:21:37.865 --> 01:21:42.368]  And I always say that because we forget what's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:21:42.368 --> 01:21:45.170]  It's one reason they want internet censorship is they're afraid of NewLeaks.
[01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:47.511]  It's all there.
[01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:49.152]  How they want to keep you poor.
[01:21:49.152 --> 01:21:50.453]  How they want to keep you dumb.
[01:21:50.453 --> 01:21:52.094]  How they don't want you to have a family.
[01:21:52.094 --> 01:21:54.076]  How they want full control.
[01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.037]  How they want low IQ idiots they can run.
[01:21:58.158 --> 01:21:59.399]  So, I'm going to say it again.
[01:21:59.399 --> 01:22:05.181]  All of these crazy, wild-eyed leftists who are promised this utopia and go into debt.
[01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.422]  They get these worthless degrees they know are worthless.
[01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:08.983]  They're not going to school to get a degree.
[01:22:08.983 --> 01:22:12.285]  They're going to school to be re-educated.
[01:22:12.285 --> 01:22:14.105]  To be brainwashed.
[01:22:14.105 --> 01:22:23.290]  And then they're turned loose as these big, entitled, spoiled brats to run around like political officers and commissars.
[01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:26.091]  And it's nasty, nasty, nasty.
[01:22:29.594 --> 01:22:37.058]  And as they realize they're going to lose the midterms, they are censoring and shutting everything down.
[01:22:37.058 --> 01:22:38.659]  I want to give the number out.
[01:22:38.659 --> 01:22:39.719]  I want to have people call in.
[01:22:39.719 --> 01:22:49.584]  I want to say first-time callers in the first round, or people that have called in and didn't get to get on when you were on hold, those folks go to the front of the line.
[01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:56.588]  On the incredible race baiting and the incredible demonization of Kanye West and Mr. Brown and Mr. Trump,
[01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:08.098]  And the Facebook and Twitter purges of thousands of pages is not 800 of prominent groups coordinated on the same day and that's just the beginning and the Congress must act.
[01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:09.318]  You must call the White House.
[01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:14.102]  This is coordinated cartelling.
[01:23:14.102 --> 01:23:23.488]  If any industry gets together to fix prices or to deny certain groups from the marketplace, that's illegal unless it's Congress passing sanctions.
[01:23:24.502 --> 01:23:31.127]  The left, the big banks, Hollywood, big tech, the Democratic Party are putting sanctions on conservatives.
[01:23:31.127 --> 01:23:42.317]  They're in CBS News last night saying you may not be able to work in the city of Los Angeles or get a contract if you are an NRA member.
[01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.439]  They're making you sign a contract that you aren't.
[01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:47.001]  You know how illegal that is?
[01:23:47.001 --> 01:23:49.322]  But why not?
[01:23:49.322 --> 01:23:53.426]  They're so bold in California, multiple cities have passed laws that illegal aliens can vote.
[01:23:54.414 --> 01:23:59.741]  How do you pass a law that violates federal law?
[01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:00.763]  You understand?
[01:24:00.763 --> 01:24:05.690]  We're in the middle of their revolution against what's left of America.
[01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:06.831]  Trump is a desperate...
[01:24:07.814 --> 01:24:18.617]  Rearguard action to just slow the thing down while we're pushed towards the edge of the cliff, while he hopes other people, hey, let's come together, one flag, you know, prosperity, God, we're about to really be destroyed.
[01:24:18.617 --> 01:24:20.077]  Why would you want to be poor?
[01:24:20.077 --> 01:24:21.978]  Why would you want race wars for the CHICOM?
[01:24:21.978 --> 01:24:23.878]  Stop, please, let's be, come on.
[01:24:23.878 --> 01:24:32.961]  No, bulldozing us over the edge of a cliff and Trump sliding, sliding towards the edge of the cliff.
[01:24:32.961 --> 01:24:37.282]  And you've got the hordes, like, battering down the castle gates.
[01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:48.716]  And then the very throngs that are battering down the castle gates are going to destroy their own future.
[01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:52.877]  But they'd rather burn the castle because it's too pretty.
[01:24:52.877 --> 01:24:54.438]  It works too well.
[01:24:54.438 --> 01:24:59.459]  They have existential envy of the fortress.
[01:24:59.459 --> 01:25:04.341]  And they want to pull it down to metaphysically, they believe, absorb it and become it.
[01:25:05.646 --> 01:25:14.977]  Just as South Pacific natives believe when they eat the heart of a strong man or the brain of a wise man, they take on the essence.
[01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:18.221]  And of course, it's called black magic.
[01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:19.282]  It's called voodoo.
[01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:22.867]  It's called evil.
[01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:23.568]  And that's what it is.
[01:25:24.571 --> 01:25:31.758]  They don't want, the globalists don't want to take over the strongest nations and then export that strength and then rise the whole civilization.
[01:25:31.758 --> 01:25:40.267]  They're not conquering things to build aqueducts and build libraries and public baths and medicine and literature.
[01:25:40.267 --> 01:25:43.130]  No, they come to destroy that, to burn it up!
[01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:48.747]  In their own creed.
[01:25:48.747 --> 01:25:50.609]  You want to see the future, Winston?
[01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:52.911]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:25:52.911 --> 01:25:55.573]  We don't want a society that lives longer, is more beautiful or better.
[01:25:55.573 --> 01:25:58.896]  We want one that's uglier and more short-lived.
[01:25:58.896 --> 01:26:01.458]  We love trampling and being trampled upon, Winston.
[01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:06.622]  You know, Winston, you look at my face as I torture you and you see my black circles around my eyes and my chipped teeth.
[01:26:07.703 --> 01:26:10.104]  You think, man, your establishment's weak.
[01:26:10.104 --> 01:26:15.507]  No, no, my establishment's strong because I was once a very handsome, you know, very smart, good, altruistic person.
[01:26:15.507 --> 01:26:22.630]  But I joined the party and turned my soul over to ripping souls out so that I can be a true evil priest of power, Winston.
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:25.732]  I am committed to total darkness, Winston.
[01:26:25.732 --> 01:26:33.495]  And when I'm done, you're going to be a mentally ill, gibbering idiot that believes 2 plus 2 is whatever I say it is with your rotting teeth pulled out.
[01:26:33.495 --> 01:26:34.576]  And then I'm going to stick you
[01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:49.287]  In a little bar to drink synthetic gin and worship Big Brother in front of a telescreen until we finally take you and blow your brains out and throw you into a furnace and your name is erased from the history books and your gas is shot up into the atmosphere.
[01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:53.811]  We are gonna suck your soul, boy!
[01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:56.293]  So your soul goes right into hell!
[01:26:56.293 --> 01:26:59.956]  We're gonna get your soul and take it down to those lower dimensions and you're gone forever.
[01:27:00.766 --> 01:27:06.670]  And I'm going to use up your fear and I'm going to suck the energy out of you because I'm a vampire.
[01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:08.091]  Do you understand that, boy?
[01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:17.377]  Think we might want to protect our children from these people?
[01:27:20.482 --> 01:27:27.567]  If someone told you 30 years ago they'd be teaching five-year-old boys that they're really girls and girls that they're boys and have all these weird little liberal families doing it.
[01:27:27.567 --> 01:27:29.809]  These are pervert families.
[01:27:29.809 --> 01:27:35.893]  This is pedophilia out in the open.
[01:27:35.893 --> 01:27:42.598]  This is the reality of what's going on because the essence is vampirism.
[01:27:42.598 --> 01:27:43.858]  Psychic.
[01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:44.279]  Kinetic.
[01:27:45.822 --> 01:27:49.644]  Energetic, soul-sucking, energy-destroying.
[01:27:49.644 --> 01:28:15.434]  If you can take the potential of a child and their whole genetic line, and what they would develop normally, go through rites of passage, and you can steal that and confuse them and make them mentally ill, it's even better than sacrificing them and drinking their blood, because you can sacrifice the entire energy line of their entire family line, and then you can have them, as a new disease mode, infect others, because the vampirism will only try to take on more
[01:28:15.894 --> 01:28:23.358]  More prey.
[01:28:23.358 --> 01:28:25.859]  This is a vampire invasion.
[01:28:25.859 --> 01:28:35.124]  A psychic, interdimensional, intergalactic, multivariate system.
[01:28:35.124 --> 01:28:44.629]  Set up in a hierarchy of vampires, in a huge energetic program, a satanic matrix, sucking your energy and breaking your will,
[01:28:46.676 --> 01:28:48.978]  First date.
[01:28:48.978 --> 01:28:50.660]  All done to blaspheme God.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:54.604]  Because the devil knows he's a loser.
[01:28:54.604 --> 01:28:55.525]  I'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:28:57.173 --> 01:29:03.959]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.

[01:29:26.997 --> 01:29:30.879]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:29:47.168 --> 01:29:47.728]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.728 --> 01:29:50.029]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.249]  X2.
[01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:31.251]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:32.972]  Ordered it six months ago.
[01:30:32.972 --> 01:30:35.714]  So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:30:35.714 --> 01:30:36.955]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:30:36.955 --> 01:30:38.916]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:41.318]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:30:41.318 --> 01:30:43.119]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[01:30:43.119 --> 01:30:45.120]  I'm sure it's viable still at X2.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.601]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[01:30:46.601 --> 01:30:48.302]  It'll be gone a couple months.

[01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:23.838]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:43.162]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:43.162 --> 01:33:44.323]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:44.323 --> 01:33:45.803]  I'm here, Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:45.803 --> 01:33:48.625]  War Room, 3 to 6.
[01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:51.666]  David Knight's in the morning, 8 to 11, kicking butt.
[01:33:51.666 --> 01:33:58.249]  And then we've launched, right through the election, the censored coverage of the 2018 midterms.
[01:33:58.249 --> 01:34:07.774]  The left's violent attacks, their promise for terrorism, their attempts to crash the stock market economy, the trade war with China that they've been launching for decades that we're now just raising a shield to.
[01:34:09.639 --> 01:34:11.861]  Eight o'clock every night, InfoWars.com.
[01:34:11.861 --> 01:34:14.743]  We're sending it out on the radio and TV satellites.
[01:34:14.743 --> 01:34:22.850]  For any radio or TV stations that want to pick it up, and quite a few TV stations are picking it up, we're only taking the breaks at the top and bottom of the hour.
[01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:25.432]  You guys get those breaks.
[01:34:25.432 --> 01:34:29.036]  We are skipping our breaks for this coverage, and then we're going to announce
[01:34:29.858 --> 01:34:30.838]  About a week after the election.
[01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:33.159]  We're going to have coverage for about a week after the election.
[01:34:33.159 --> 01:34:33.940]  It'll be aftermath.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:39.262]  We're going to launch a new broadcast from 7 to 10 o'clock every single night here.
[01:34:39.262 --> 01:34:42.623]  As we promise to expand towards the new year.
[01:34:42.623 --> 01:34:45.485]  In the face of globalist attacks, thanks to your prayers and your support.
[01:34:45.485 --> 01:34:48.166]  And don't forget, they're trying to shut us down right now.
[01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:49.606]  So without you, we will be shut down.
[01:34:49.606 --> 01:34:52.648]  Alright, I'm going to take phone calls and play clips for the rest of the broadcast here.
[01:34:52.648 --> 01:34:57.770]  I mean, I feel like if I'm not up here yelling and screaming and saying Red Alert, that I'm actually hurting us.
[01:35:00.182 --> 01:35:01.443]  The internet kills what is in place.
[01:35:01.443 --> 01:35:03.884]  Trump doesn't have control of it, as I said a few weeks ago.
[01:35:03.884 --> 01:35:05.264]  Now they've announced that today.
[01:35:05.264 --> 01:35:06.725]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[01:35:06.725 --> 01:35:09.206]  The censorship has gone thermonuclear.
[01:35:09.206 --> 01:35:12.788]  Every major conservative site you can imagine being banned off Twitter and Facebook.
[01:35:12.788 --> 01:35:16.590]  I mean, they have titrated the dose, they've conditioned us, and now they're making their big move.
[01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:18.411]  That is a military tactic as well.
[01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:22.913]  Where you do pinprick attacks, where people don't take them serious anymore, then you hit them with a big one.
[01:35:23.815 --> 01:35:27.316]  That, again, is a tactic we use in Panama and many other areas.
[01:35:27.316 --> 01:35:32.817]  And that's what other systems use, and this is economic and psychological warfare.
[01:35:32.817 --> 01:35:35.077]  And so notice it's not even big news now.
[01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:38.538]  Everybody heard about censorship until they got sick of it about Alex Jones.
[01:35:38.538 --> 01:35:41.439]  Then I predicted it wouldn't get a lot of attention when it was everybody else.
[01:35:41.439 --> 01:35:44.639]  I know the enemy game plan.
[01:35:44.639 --> 01:35:48.440]  I know the enemy game plan.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.501]  And they've gone from denying censoring to celebrating it and saying, we don't like it, we think,
[01:35:54.724 --> 01:35:57.826]  The Daily Caller's spam.
[01:35:57.826 --> 01:36:00.529]  We think, and then everybody's banned.
[01:36:00.529 --> 01:36:01.790]  We think Michelle Malcolm's spam.
[01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:06.133]  No, she's effective, she's smart, she does a great job.
[01:36:06.133 --> 01:36:07.194]  Even though we had a fight one time.
[01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:11.577]  Because I showed Marines killing a puppy.
[01:36:11.577 --> 01:36:14.960]  And I said, listen, I support the military, but I don't like people killing innocent animals and stuff.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.421]  It makes people look bad.
[01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:19.363]  And she said it was a robot dog.
[01:36:19.363 --> 01:36:21.025]  No, it wasn't a robot dog, okay?
[01:36:22.301 --> 01:36:27.803]  And so, some of her handlers bumped into me with their elbows, so I bumped into him a lot harder, too.
[01:36:27.803 --> 01:36:32.865]  And, uh, I was like some 6'5 guy, but he wasn't tough, and he hit me with his elbows.
[01:36:32.865 --> 01:36:40.929]  I rammed him in his elbow and felt something crack, and he was like, whoa, and I was like, uh, yeah, dude, you hit me, I'm gonna actually hit you back hard, but it's shit.
[01:36:40.929 --> 01:36:45.851]  And so, but she's been banned off Facebook, and it's all happening right now.
[01:36:45.851 --> 01:36:50.933]  Thousands of people, thousands of prominent groups, some of these pages with millions of followers.
[01:36:50.933 --> 01:36:51.233]  It's here.
[01:36:52.645 --> 01:36:53.886]  So how do we respond to that?
[01:36:53.886 --> 01:36:54.506]  What do we do?
[01:36:54.506 --> 01:36:56.267]  Do you agree with me they're coming over the top?
[01:36:56.267 --> 01:36:57.768]  I mean, this is the big push.
[01:36:57.768 --> 01:37:01.871]  I see an exponential buildup where I don't see how they turn it up after the election.
[01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:06.233]  They know in the internal polls and even public ones now that there's a red wave.
[01:37:06.233 --> 01:37:15.059]  And they couldn't stop the second SCOTUS appointment.
[01:37:15.059 --> 01:37:15.399]  And so
[01:37:17.383 --> 01:37:24.729]  The calls for violence, the open borders, the Islamification, the demonization, the race war garbage, it's all gone into hyperdrive.
[01:37:24.729 --> 01:37:26.991]  So what do we do to counter this?
[01:37:26.991 --> 01:37:28.652]  What do we do to expose what's happening?
[01:37:28.652 --> 01:37:32.195]  What stunts do we pull that are legal and lawful in the media?
[01:37:32.195 --> 01:37:35.938]  Like we did saying Bill Clinton's a rapist that helped defeat Hillary.
[01:37:35.938 --> 01:37:38.641]  We have to get out in the streets.
[01:37:38.641 --> 01:37:43.184]  We have to get aggressive politically.
[01:37:43.184 --> 01:37:43.705]  Economically.
[01:37:45.031 --> 01:37:46.712]  I mean, look, they're getting aggressive.
[01:37:46.712 --> 01:37:49.574]  $38 million, twice what Ted Cruz has raised.
[01:37:49.574 --> 01:37:54.117]  The most ever in three months for a Senate candidate for veto.
[01:37:54.117 --> 01:37:58.360]  That idiot, moron, anti-gun, slimebag.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.161]  And it's just every news channel in Texas.
[01:38:00.161 --> 01:38:06.706]  Worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship.
[01:38:06.706 --> 01:38:10.028]  On and on and on.
[01:38:10.028 --> 01:38:11.869]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:38:14.065 --> 01:38:15.406]  And it's bad.
[01:38:15.406 --> 01:38:16.606]  And it's Soros money.
[01:38:16.606 --> 01:38:18.127]  And it's Globalist money.
[01:38:18.127 --> 01:38:20.768]  And they're making their move.
[01:38:20.768 --> 01:38:22.689]  Now look, you guys have been supporting us.
[01:38:22.689 --> 01:38:27.452]  I'm going to give the number out.
[01:38:27.452 --> 01:38:30.753]  First-time callers are people that have called them before but were unable to get on air.
[01:38:30.753 --> 01:38:33.795]  When you shout on hold.
[01:38:33.795 --> 01:38:35.856]  That counts as a first-time caller.
[01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:36.916]  We just have a big phone system.
[01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:38.997]  It can take tons of calls at the same time.
[01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:41.398]  So that's why sometimes we don't get to your calls, but I'm going to try here.
[01:38:41.398 --> 01:38:41.859]  Good to everybody.
[01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:49.053]  I don't have words to describe how coordinated and evil this is and how outrageous it is.
[01:38:49.053 --> 01:38:54.857]  And I'm so ashamed that we're on the knife edge of retaining the House and the Senate.
[01:38:54.857 --> 01:39:04.504]  The House particularly, because people can't choose America and our recovery and goodness over the Chi-Coms and Hollywood and all this scum.
[01:39:04.504 --> 01:39:10.288]  But that's how many people they brainwashed and wrecked and ruined and who like to get into the hate.
[01:39:11.576 --> 01:39:20.563]  Of calling Trump an evil white supremacist who was looking at Kanye and looking at Mr. Brown and thinking racist thoughts.
[01:39:20.563 --> 01:39:24.566]  That's what Cuomo said, Chris Cuomo.
[01:39:24.566 --> 01:39:30.391]  And all the things they said, I don't want to repeat it, but they called him a dumb, ignorant Negro.
[01:39:33.206 --> 01:39:35.567]  Which is like the n-word now in parlance.
[01:39:35.567 --> 01:39:36.388]  It's not a racist word.
[01:39:36.388 --> 01:39:39.729]  It's like Anglo, Negro.
[01:39:39.729 --> 01:39:43.891]  Negro means black in Spanish or Latin.
[01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:46.693]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:46.693 --> 01:39:51.555]  They're up there invoking serious racism and saying he's like a minstrel show.
[01:39:51.555 --> 01:39:55.797]  And that he's a white supremacist puppet.
[01:39:55.797 --> 01:39:57.118]  I already played it last hour.
[01:39:57.118 --> 01:39:58.559]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:01.020]  These are nasty people using the race card.
[01:40:02.284 --> 01:40:10.229]  And they sit up there with a big consensus of experts, who are all just Democratic Party hacks reading a script, and just parroting, parroting, parroting.
[01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:23.056]  And you've got 28% in most polls, up from 13% of black folks in this country saying they now support President Trump.
[01:40:23.056 --> 01:40:26.138]  And you know a lot of folks, black or white, are scared to say they support Trump in a poll.
[01:40:27.509 --> 01:40:28.409]  And even how they sample it.
[01:40:28.409 --> 01:40:33.050]  So I'd say that number's at like 45, 50 and that's why the globalists are crapping their britches.
[01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:41.472]  You know, I've been down at the Travis County Courthouse this week and we had a real blessing and I'm just going to leave it at that and just thank God for all your prayers and I appreciate everybody out there.
[01:40:41.472 --> 01:40:48.273]  Some very positive things have gone on for my family and for justice.
[01:40:48.273 --> 01:40:49.713]  And I'll leave it at that.
[01:40:49.713 --> 01:40:51.254]  Some sad things, but things that had to be done.
[01:40:56.323 --> 01:40:59.965]  I mean, I just couldn't get the black people and Hispanics to stop shaking my hand.
[01:40:59.965 --> 01:41:03.247]  I mean, white folks like me too, but let me tell you, the black folks love me.
[01:41:03.247 --> 01:41:05.188]  The Hispanic folks love me, and I love them.
[01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:12.392]  And I'm walking down the street just shaking hands, black folks in suits, black guys in repair uniforms, Hispanic folks, families.
[01:41:12.392 --> 01:41:20.076]  I got that little cafeteria down there with all the little Hispanic ladies in it, and they're just all sweethearts, they all know who I am, they all like me, they all know, they're not stupid.
[01:41:20.076 --> 01:41:23.938]  They can tell I walk in there, I'm a nice guy, and everybody, people know I'm not a villain!
[01:41:25.458 --> 01:41:27.298]  So all the propaganda hadn't worked.
[01:41:27.298 --> 01:41:30.999]  So I've just got to be taken completely off the air, don't I?
[01:41:30.999 --> 01:41:34.320]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:34.920]  I like women.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.501]  I'm how God made me.
[01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:44.482]  I like enchiladas and cold beer too, and I probably drink too much of that and eat too much of it.
[01:41:44.482 --> 01:41:47.543]  But the point is, is I love life.
[01:41:47.543 --> 01:41:48.343]  And I love justice.
[01:41:48.343 --> 01:41:50.644]  And I love seeing your success.
[01:41:50.644 --> 01:41:51.444]  And I believe in you.
[01:41:51.444 --> 01:41:53.445]  So we're going to give the number out.
[01:41:53.445 --> 01:41:53.985]  We come back.
[01:41:53.985 --> 01:41:54.725]  We're going to take calls.
[01:41:55.834 --> 01:41:57.715]  We've got some really special stuff in the fourth hour today.
[01:41:57.715 --> 01:42:03.077]  Can you believe Hillary is going to run for president and they're going to give her the nomination?
[01:42:03.077 --> 01:42:04.778]  It's confirmed.
[01:42:04.778 --> 01:42:07.859]  The CIA, the people that aren't leftists, are totally blown away.
[01:42:07.859 --> 01:42:09.300]  They've been at the planning meetings.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.261]  This is being planned.
[01:42:11.261 --> 01:42:14.382]  And Michelle Obama is going to be VP.
[01:42:14.382 --> 01:42:15.783]  That's the ticket.
[01:42:15.783 --> 01:42:16.943]  So you heard it here first.
[01:42:16.943 --> 01:42:19.464]  Next year's news today.
[01:42:19.464 --> 01:42:22.666]  Maybe putting it out there, it's thought, might stop it, but who knows.
[01:42:25.196 --> 01:42:27.651]  And they want me off the air because these predictions aren't predictions.
[01:42:27.651 --> 01:42:28.858]  The things are set up.
[01:42:31.829 --> 01:42:32.409]  At that level.
[01:42:32.409 --> 01:42:34.330]  And Trump is the insurgency against that.
[01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:35.750]  We are the resistance.
[01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.131]  Don't forget, I've got the biggest sale we've ever done.
[01:42:38.131 --> 01:42:39.852]  Without your funding, we won't be here.
[01:42:39.852 --> 01:42:42.073]  Free shipping store-wide on everything.
[01:42:42.073 --> 01:42:43.613]  And 50% off on all the supplements.
[01:42:43.613 --> 01:42:44.754]  It's Christmas.
[01:42:44.754 --> 01:42:45.654]  It's Black Friday.
[01:42:45.654 --> 01:42:46.634]  It's Cyber Monday.
[01:42:46.634 --> 01:42:47.815]  All rolled into one.
[01:42:47.815 --> 01:42:49.515]  So everything must go.
[01:42:49.515 --> 01:42:50.776]  Everything must sell.
[01:42:50.776 --> 01:42:53.177]  Because we may not even have the ability to take orders soon.
[01:42:53.177 --> 01:42:54.337]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:42:54.337 --> 01:42:55.418]  You've seen it all over the news.
[01:42:55.418 --> 01:42:56.398]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:42:57.165 --> 01:43:03.549]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[01:44:44.966 --> 01:44:48.269]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:03.436 --> 01:45:12.119]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:12.119 --> 01:45:14.080]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.541]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:20.162]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:20.162 --> 01:45:22.443]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.443 --> 01:45:29.406]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[01:45:29.946 --> 01:45:39.750]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.930]  We'll win.
[01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:43.831]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:45:43.831 --> 01:45:50.994]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:45:50.994 --> 01:45:54.675]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.

[01:46:54.798 --> 01:46:56.219]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.338 --> 01:47:13.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.560]  Watch me!
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.341]  Watch me!
[01:47:15.341 --> 01:47:16.401]  Too hard not to do that.
[01:47:16.401 --> 01:47:17.241]  Watch me!
[01:47:17.241 --> 01:47:18.402]  I got something.
[01:47:18.402 --> 01:47:20.223]  I got it.
[01:47:20.223 --> 01:47:21.603]  Watch me!
[01:47:21.603 --> 01:47:22.264]  Trump's got it.
[01:47:22.264 --> 01:47:23.584]  I got it.
[01:47:23.584 --> 01:47:24.264]  Hey!
[01:47:24.264 --> 01:47:25.145]  Mr. Brown's got it.
[01:47:25.145 --> 01:47:25.925]  I got something.
[01:47:25.925 --> 01:47:27.106]  Mr. West has got it.
[01:47:27.106 --> 01:47:28.666]  And you got it, folks.
[01:47:28.666 --> 01:47:31.488]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[01:47:31.488 --> 01:47:33.408]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:33.408 --> 01:47:34.369]  I got soul.
[01:47:34.369 --> 01:47:35.689]  I got soul.
[01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:36.930]  And I'm super bad.
[01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:40.211]  Not bad in a bad way, bad in a good way.
[01:47:40.211 --> 01:47:44.553]  Let's listen to Mr. Brown a little bit more.
[01:47:44.553 --> 01:47:45.634]  Feels so good.
[01:47:45.634 --> 01:47:47.535]  Tells me what to do.
[01:47:47.535 --> 01:47:48.975]  And I'm super bad.
[01:48:08.188 --> 01:48:09.308]  Now, let's get serious here.
[01:48:09.308 --> 01:48:21.273]  The toll-free number to join us on, do you think I'm exaggerating how deadly dangerous the times are and that things are so critical at this point, I should be on air 24 hours a day.
[01:48:21.273 --> 01:48:25.674]  And we all just have the normalcy of living in a quasi-free country.
[01:48:25.674 --> 01:48:31.996]  We have real authoritarians in a real power grab.
[01:48:31.996 --> 01:48:34.597]  America is in the greatest danger it's ever been in.
[01:48:34.597 --> 01:48:36.878]  Because King George III was an angel.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.501]  Compared to the elites we have today.
[01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:44.983]  He was a wonderful person compared to them.
[01:48:44.983 --> 01:48:48.385]  Some could say even honorable.
[01:48:48.385 --> 01:48:51.106]  Just tyrannical.
[01:48:51.106 --> 01:48:53.847]  But not a bad person.
[01:48:53.847 --> 01:48:57.569]  I've read several history books from different perspectives.
[01:48:57.569 --> 01:48:59.810]  Mentally ill, yes, from inbreeding.
[01:48:59.810 --> 01:49:02.812]  But believed he was doing good things.
[01:49:02.812 --> 01:49:03.332]  Had courage.
[01:49:06.243 --> 01:49:15.586]  People running things in this country are the worst synthesis of decades of scum promoting themselves up, and only the very worst getting in positions of power.
[01:49:15.586 --> 01:49:17.907]  It's a marathon of evil.
[01:49:17.907 --> 01:49:20.928]  A survival of the worst.
[01:49:20.928 --> 01:49:23.729]  Of the most twisted.
[01:49:23.729 --> 01:49:25.049]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[01:49:25.049 --> 01:49:29.450]  See, you know, the globalists years ago said, oh, we don't care if Jones is on air, he's just scaring them for us.
[01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:32.591]  No, you think we're like you.
[01:49:32.591 --> 01:49:33.872]  I believed in people.
[01:49:34.778 --> 01:49:39.320]  And that if they knew the threat, they'd want to do something about it.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.440]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.543]  If I saw thugs breaking into my neighbor's house, I'd call the police.
[01:49:47.543 --> 01:50:02.508]  But if I saw them, say, pistol-whipping my neighbor, I would get excited, not because I'm a violent person, but then at that point, I have an instinct that I would enjoy going into gear and grabbing a firearm and taking action.
[01:50:05.299 --> 01:50:08.621]  Just like I enjoy it, I got a boil on my foot lancing it.
[01:50:08.621 --> 01:50:11.622]  It hurts, pus comes out, but your body says that's good.
[01:50:11.622 --> 01:50:15.805]  That's what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:50:15.805 --> 01:50:16.525]  It's the same thing.
[01:50:16.525 --> 01:50:19.307]  This is what you're born for, folks.
[01:50:19.307 --> 01:50:21.948]  This is what it's all about right now.
[01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:26.190]  We're facing real evil, and I'm going to say it for the 10th time today.
[01:50:26.190 --> 01:50:27.731]  Everybody kept saying, how's it going?
[01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:28.892]  Man, you must be really down.
[01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:37.754]  What's it like, you know, they're gonna destroy you, they're gonna try to destroy your operation, they're gonna try to bankrupt you, and I'm like, uh, get ready, they're coming for you!
[01:50:37.754 --> 01:50:39.215]  Come on, let's go, let's get them!
[01:50:39.215 --> 01:50:40.915]  I mean, it's not me!
[01:50:40.915 --> 01:50:43.737]  You're under attack!
[01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:47.859]  They're stealing your birthright, people!
[01:50:47.859 --> 01:50:49.260]  I'm more alive than I've ever been!
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.821]  I'm in a war!
[01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:53.142]  Wake up!
[01:50:53.142 --> 01:50:53.822]  You're in one!
[01:50:58.547 --> 01:51:17.175]  With child molesting, scum, psychopaths that see you as food on the table, the states, who are into being evil, who are allied with the Chinese Communists, and I'll say it again, who've killed five times in their own admissions what Hitler did.
[01:51:21.701 --> 01:51:23.862]  Now, I'm going to ask you again.
[01:51:23.862 --> 01:51:27.404]  Why in the world would everyone not be behind Trump?
[01:51:27.404 --> 01:51:30.906]  And why would everyone in the world not be behind restoring our republic?
[01:51:30.906 --> 01:51:34.348]  What is your problem?
[01:51:34.348 --> 01:51:36.309]  And our audience is like, no, we're awake, we're involved.
[01:51:36.309 --> 01:51:37.609]  No, I'm not talking to you.
[01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:38.670]  Thank God you're awake.
[01:51:38.670 --> 01:51:39.911]  Thank God you're the reason we're here.
[01:51:39.911 --> 01:51:41.371]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:51:41.371 --> 01:51:42.492]  You know what I'm saying.
[01:51:42.492 --> 01:51:46.034]  Well, we got to go tell the sheep out there.
[01:51:46.034 --> 01:51:47.775]  Listen, bro, you're with the wolves.
[01:51:47.775 --> 01:51:49.015]  They're eating your butt.
[01:51:49.015 --> 01:51:49.756]  They're not good.
[01:51:50.879 --> 01:51:54.342]  They're not even wearing sheep's clothing!
[01:51:54.342 --> 01:51:56.004]  And they're coming for everybody.
[01:51:56.004 --> 01:51:57.906]  They're trying to sew it all up right now.
[01:51:57.906 --> 01:51:59.607]  The doors are closing.
[01:51:59.607 --> 01:52:01.850]  The knives are coming out.
[01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:03.611]  They're butchering people all around you!
[01:52:03.611 --> 01:52:08.096]  They're uncloaked!
[01:52:08.096 --> 01:52:09.057]  They're firing on you!
[01:52:10.603 --> 01:52:21.431]  See, a lot of people think, on with the establishment, mainstream media, whatever is in Vogue magazine, whatever is on ABC News, they still think that if they parrot that, they're like in the majority and cool.
[01:52:21.431 --> 01:52:22.531]  They're followers!
[01:52:22.531 --> 01:52:23.212]  Okay, great!
[01:52:23.212 --> 01:52:24.053]  You want to be followers?
[01:52:24.053 --> 01:52:24.453]  That's great!
[01:52:26.152 --> 01:52:36.566]  You're like sheep marching into a banquet, and a bunch of wolves are sitting around a big table, and you see sheep hanging up by their feet, gutted, and wolves gobbling the fresh meat, and you say, what's for dinner?
[01:52:36.566 --> 01:52:40.432]  And they're like, you don't know, you don't smell the blood and guts, you dumb idiot!
[01:52:40.432 --> 01:52:41.593]  We're gonna eat your ass!
[01:52:45.882 --> 01:52:52.243]  Instead, you are lined up with the wolves, saying, protect us from those sheepdogs we saw back there in the field.
[01:52:52.243 --> 01:52:58.884]  They were trying to tell us not to go this direction, but we didn't listen to them and we came down here.
[01:52:58.884 --> 01:53:01.845]  And the wolves are like, well, thank you, you're a really good person.
[01:53:01.845 --> 01:53:04.665]  Come on in here.
[01:53:04.665 --> 01:53:05.966]  So here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:53:05.966 --> 01:53:06.546]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:06.606]  877-789-2539.
[01:53:06.606 --> 01:53:07.306]  What do we do to stop this?
[01:53:07.306 --> 01:53:07.486]  I just...
[01:53:15.606 --> 01:53:16.466]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:53:16.466 --> 01:53:17.547]  It's bad.
[01:53:17.547 --> 01:53:22.009]  The good news is we're on air, we're fighting it, but my God, this is all un-American tyranny taking place.
[01:53:22.009 --> 01:53:23.070]  It's naked now.
[01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:24.891]  There's no holding back now.
[01:53:24.891 --> 01:53:25.911]  It's real.
[01:53:25.911 --> 01:53:27.892]  They're preparing mass bombings like I told you.
[01:53:27.892 --> 01:53:29.913]  I even said they'll bomb D.C.
[01:53:29.913 --> 01:53:35.536]  before the election, and now they bust a guy with 200 pounds who's a crazy Democrat.
[01:53:35.536 --> 01:53:36.677]  I'm gonna go to some clubs here.
[01:53:38.758 --> 01:53:40.578]  And, you know, here's the breaking news.
[01:53:40.578 --> 01:53:43.159]  Senator Cotton, we have a clip coming up next hour.
[01:53:43.159 --> 01:53:46.920]  The Schumer political operation was behind the release of Dr. Ford's letter from the very beginning.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.140]  We knew that.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:53.241]  Rand Paul, media cover-ups, police shootings, shouting, this is for health care.
[01:53:53.241 --> 01:53:58.962]  Because they hadn't given them their free health care.
[01:53:58.962 --> 01:53:59.942]  And then all the rest of it.
[01:53:59.942 --> 01:54:02.763]  I've got all this Islamic news that is just unbelievable.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:07.501]  Poland and Austria to quit UN migration compact.
[01:54:07.501 --> 01:54:09.582]  We want Poles to be safe in our own country.
[01:54:09.582 --> 01:54:18.525]  He goes on to say they're joining Hungary, the United States, and others in not having the UN run, who can come into your country.
[01:54:18.525 --> 01:54:24.748]  Yeah, until last year, going back to Bill Clinton, the UN was over who came to the US.
[01:54:24.748 --> 01:54:26.868]  And guess who runs that?
[01:54:26.868 --> 01:54:29.149]  You guessed it, a board appointed by George Soros.
[01:54:35.003 --> 01:54:35.623]  There's another one.
[01:54:35.623 --> 01:54:36.284]  Greece.
[01:54:36.284 --> 01:54:45.550]  Large Christian cross pulled down because it could offend to Muslim migrants on the island of Lesbos that's had thousands, hundreds of thousands of Islamists' land.
[01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:47.932]  They didn't like it, so they're pulling it down all over Europe.
[01:54:47.932 --> 01:54:52.415]  They're removing it from churches and public places, saying it's racist.
[01:54:52.415 --> 01:54:57.078]  And the EU is appointing all Muslim boards to have it all removed.
[01:54:57.078 --> 01:54:58.358]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:54:58.358 --> 01:54:59.379]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:59.379 --> 01:55:00.420]  Cannot make that up.
[01:55:02.992 --> 01:55:06.855]  Marks and Spencer criticized for selling school uniform hijabs for toddlers.
[01:55:06.855 --> 01:55:12.498]  They're now telling even kids at public schools and private schools that have any Muslims going there, cover your girls.
[01:55:12.498 --> 01:55:12.698]  See?
[01:55:12.698 --> 01:55:14.800]  It's a real law.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.161]  Oh, you don't want to offend the Muslims.
[01:55:17.916 --> 01:55:22.701]  SJW has won that Dwayne The Rock Johnson is not black enough to play John Henry.
[01:55:22.701 --> 01:55:23.982]  That's just some of the type of stuff.
[01:55:23.982 --> 01:55:28.767]  And then tomorrow, Internet across the globe to face downtime over the next 48 hours.
[01:55:28.767 --> 01:55:30.349]  ITAN's having problems.
[01:55:30.349 --> 01:55:32.030]  They're testing the Internet kill switch.
[01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:35.013]  Obama transferred most of the control of the Internet to the UN.
[01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:42.212]  And the EU and a board run by George Soros!
[01:55:42.212 --> 01:55:54.117]  When he did it three years ago, Soros said in leaked documents that came out, it was in the news, that they would ban all conservative and nationalist news to stop the collapse of the world government, calling it fake news and hate.
[01:55:54.117 --> 01:55:54.778]  And here we are!
[01:55:54.778 --> 01:55:56.118]  They're still doing it!
[01:55:56.118 --> 01:55:57.659]  And what's the President gonna do?
[01:55:57.659 --> 01:56:00.080]  He's surrounded by a bunch of cowards that won't stop this!
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:06.702]  The Pentagon shouldn't be meeting with Google next week about their treason.
[01:56:06.702 --> 01:56:09.663]  They should be taking it over.
[01:56:09.663 --> 01:56:13.425]  It's our company, our infrastructure, we paid for it, and they merged with the Chinese.
[01:56:13.425 --> 01:56:15.126]  It's a national security threat.
[01:56:15.126 --> 01:56:16.867]  This isn't radical statements.
[01:56:16.867 --> 01:56:19.928]  We are basically gone if we don't do that.
[01:56:19.928 --> 01:56:29.293]  Tim Cook should be absolutely indicted for treason and espionage, giving all the code keys to China and letting them put spy chips at Foxconn into all the damn phones.
[01:56:31.368 --> 01:56:33.609]  Are you worried Tim Cook banned you?
[01:56:33.609 --> 01:56:34.209]  I'm worried?
[01:56:34.209 --> 01:56:35.410]  He's the traitor!
[01:56:35.410 --> 01:56:36.950]  I don't care what they do to me!
[01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:38.391]  I'm gonna go down with the ship!
[01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:40.172]  I'm not a frickin' traitor!
[01:56:40.172 --> 01:56:43.753]  I'm not Benedict Arnold, baby!
[01:56:43.753 --> 01:56:45.434]  It was some big giant free country.
[01:56:45.434 --> 01:56:46.174]  I'd marry it.
[01:56:46.174 --> 01:56:47.995]  I'd merge with it.
[01:56:47.995 --> 01:56:50.416]  It ain't!
[01:56:50.416 --> 01:56:53.777]  I think America should merge with Switzerland today.
[01:56:53.777 --> 01:56:54.337]  China?
[01:56:54.337 --> 01:56:56.218]  No.
[01:56:56.218 --> 01:56:58.259]  Get it?
[01:56:58.259 --> 01:56:59.899]  I'm loyal to freedom.
[01:56:59.899 --> 01:57:00.920]  And I'm loyal to free will.
[01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:03.072]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:57:03.072 --> 01:57:04.553]  I've got all these clips and I'm going right to your calls.
[01:57:04.553 --> 01:57:05.493]  We're gonna take your phone calls.

[01:57:05.793 --> 01:57:08.434]  How do we stop this?
[01:57:08.434 --> 01:57:09.175]  How critical is this?
[01:57:09.175 --> 01:57:10.095]  Do you feel the energy?
[01:57:10.095 --> 01:57:11.016]  Do you feel the critical?
[01:57:11.016 --> 01:57:12.236]  Do you feel the time is short?
[01:57:12.236 --> 01:57:17.958]  Do you feel how... We're down to the wire here and the enemy's throwing everything they got.
[01:57:17.958 --> 01:57:19.199]  They're getting ready for massive violence.

[01:57:47.239 --> 01:57:55.625]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.625 --> 01:57:57.086]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.086 --> 01:58:01.789]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[01:59:51.257 --> 01:59:53.919]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.915 --> 02:00:17.562]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.562 --> 02:00:21.124]  Oh, you don't hear about fusing GPS anymore.
[02:00:21.124 --> 02:00:29.049]  Cooked up by Jeb Bush, and then handed over to Hillary, and then more garbage dumped on top of it.
[02:00:29.049 --> 02:00:29.970]  BuzzFeed putting it out.
[02:00:31.744 --> 02:00:33.086]  With women urinating on him.
[02:00:33.086 --> 02:00:36.270]  Absolute hogwash.
[02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:38.353]  Absolute balderdash.
[02:00:38.353 --> 02:00:42.479]  Complete and total fiction of the defamatory type.
[02:00:44.099 --> 02:00:46.421]  That's okay, because they were doing it to a white supremacist.
[02:00:46.421 --> 02:00:47.881]  Oh, that's not true either.
[02:00:47.881 --> 02:00:49.723]  But now Kanye's a white supremacist.
[02:00:49.723 --> 02:00:51.544]  The calls are coming up next segment.
[02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:54.386]  But here's the latest breaking news alert.
[02:00:54.386 --> 02:00:59.449]  The head of Fusion GPS has taken the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
[02:00:59.449 --> 02:01:04.952]  Here is that important news.
[02:01:04.952 --> 02:01:06.073]  Capitol Hill.
[02:01:06.073 --> 02:01:08.614]  Can lawmakers force him to answer questions?
[02:01:08.614 --> 02:01:12.277]  We're going to get insight from a veteran of the Watergate investigation.
[02:01:16.973 --> 02:01:19.154]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:19.154 --> 02:01:22.396]  They are now running for the hills.
[02:01:22.396 --> 02:01:26.638]  And gotta leave PM there in case you need that as well.
[02:01:26.638 --> 02:01:27.198]  I was making a joke.
[02:01:27.198 --> 02:01:28.479]  Aleve is our new sponsor.
[02:01:28.479 --> 02:01:29.480]  The left will put articles out.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:30.620]  Stop them immediately.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.961]  Oh my God, you're funding white supremacists.
[02:01:32.961 --> 02:01:36.163]  Just think about how criminal the media is.
[02:01:36.163 --> 02:01:37.724]  Think about how out of control they are.
[02:01:39.807 --> 02:01:40.587]  The so-called media.
[02:01:40.587 --> 02:01:41.208]  They're not media.
[02:01:41.208 --> 02:01:43.669]  They're psychological terrorists.
[02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:45.950]  They are liars, and they know they're liars.
[02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:50.312]  And then all they try to do is get more and more radical, lie more and more because the old lies didn't work.
[02:01:50.312 --> 02:01:51.412]  Here, let's just make it worse.
[02:01:51.412 --> 02:01:52.393]  Let's make it more intense.
[02:01:52.393 --> 02:01:53.833]  Let's make it more out of control.
[02:01:53.833 --> 02:02:02.618]  I want to play a clip here of Jim Brown that was
[02:02:04.147 --> 02:02:05.688]  I can be very blunt about taking a knee.
[02:02:05.688 --> 02:02:06.549]  See, first of all, I'm an American.
[02:02:33.413 --> 02:02:36.554]  That flag is my flag.
[02:02:36.554 --> 02:02:41.496]  Things that I've overcome in this country allows to make me a better person.
[02:02:41.496 --> 02:02:49.279]  I don't think that we should take knees in protests instead of standing up for our flag.
[02:02:49.279 --> 02:02:52.780]  I think we should work out our problems as a family.
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:59.323]  And that's what I would advocate to my children, to all the young people that I deal with.
[02:02:59.323 --> 02:03:01.063]  I am an American.
[02:03:01.063 --> 02:03:02.444]  That flag is my flag.
[02:03:03.752 --> 02:03:11.016]  And I want to represent it that way.
[02:03:11.016 --> 02:03:12.736]  Well, you'd have to talk to Conway.
[02:03:12.736 --> 02:03:18.119]  I mean, he's a beautiful human being, but I can't speak for anyone.
[02:03:18.119 --> 02:03:21.060]  Two more questions.
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:22.361]  Two more questions.
[02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.141]  I don't get shot.
[02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:30.695]  We're gonna move on, thank you.
[02:03:30.695 --> 02:03:32.116]  All right, last question, excuse me.
[02:03:32.116 --> 02:03:32.576]  Last question.
[02:03:32.576 --> 02:03:33.776]  Mr. Brown, I have a follow up question.
[02:03:33.776 --> 02:03:42.118]  What's been the reaction from members of the football community to your support for this administration's president?
[02:03:42.118 --> 02:03:45.299]  Really, I don't know.
[02:03:45.299 --> 02:03:53.140]  I really don't, I really don't really care.
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.761]  Because this is the President of the United States.
[02:03:57.657 --> 02:04:05.521]  He allowed me to be invited to his territory.
[02:04:05.521 --> 02:04:10.103]  He treated us beautifully.
[02:04:10.103 --> 02:04:13.085]  And he shared some thoughts.
[02:04:13.085 --> 02:04:17.907]  And he will be open to talking when I get back to him.
[02:04:17.907 --> 02:04:19.288]  That's the best he could do for me.
[02:04:20.874 --> 02:04:24.878]  So I'm happy to say on that it's been very successful.
[02:04:24.878 --> 02:04:26.179]  I want to give you all my respect.
[02:04:26.179 --> 02:04:27.000]  We got to go.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:27.820]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:29.902]  Thank you.
[02:04:29.902 --> 02:04:30.783]  That's a classy guy.
[02:04:30.783 --> 02:04:32.665]  They don't make it like that anymore, do they?
[02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:33.806]  No, they don't.
[02:04:35.405 --> 02:04:39.249]  He respects himself, he respects the President, and he cares about the black community.
[02:04:39.249 --> 02:04:41.531]  And it's absolutely behind the scenes.
[02:04:41.531 --> 02:04:44.994]  Gotten tens of thousands of youth out of trouble and created tens of thousands of jobs.
[02:04:44.994 --> 02:04:51.580]  And now he's helping President Trump energize the black community with real investment and real jobs and a real future.

[02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:07.758]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:37.406 --> 02:06:41.329]  Well, I missed Zach's call last night.
[02:06:41.329 --> 02:06:44.071]  I get to the point where I just got to turn my cell phone off.
[02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:45.832]  But, you know, I know Zach.
[02:06:45.832 --> 02:06:46.672]  I know who Zach is.
[02:06:46.672 --> 02:06:52.076]  I know he's friends with Kanye West and friends with a lot of other folks like Elon Musk.
[02:06:52.076 --> 02:06:56.459]  And he was also friends with Anthony Bourdain.
[02:06:56.459 --> 02:06:59.081]  And he's a really interesting fella.
[02:06:59.081 --> 02:07:02.443]  And I can't, he doesn't want to get into who he is at this point.
[02:07:02.443 --> 02:07:05.265]  And his history and his background was very, very interesting.
[02:07:06.306 --> 02:07:08.388]  And complex.
[02:07:08.388 --> 02:07:13.411]  And, of course, Kanye's come out and said Alex Jones and Donald Trump are the ultimate matrix breakers.
[02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:20.776]  But everybody that goes against the grain, when the grain is evil, is a matrix breaker.
[02:07:20.776 --> 02:07:25.479]  And this is a very magic time to be alive right now, where humanity's at a crossroads.
[02:07:25.479 --> 02:07:35.186]  But I noticed, I get the number out, and Zach, who wouldn't come on the last three, four months, because of Homeland Security harassing him and his family,
[02:07:36.516 --> 02:07:38.697]  And again, Trump isn't in full control of Homeland Security.
[02:07:38.697 --> 02:07:44.260]  I know a lot of that got shut down now, but because of the security clearances and things he's had, they really came after him.
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:50.344]  He didn't give anything secret out on the show, but they sure came after him.
[02:07:50.344 --> 02:07:53.906]  And of course, he's good friends with Louis Farrakhan and a bunch of other people.
[02:07:53.906 --> 02:07:55.227]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:07:55.227 --> 02:07:57.248]  So he's connected.
[02:07:57.248 --> 02:07:59.309]  And a lot of stuff's been going on to him and his family.
[02:07:59.309 --> 02:08:00.930]  He knows a lot of things about Libya and things.
[02:08:02.515 --> 02:08:04.756]  No, and I'll just, again, leave it at that.
[02:08:04.756 --> 02:08:06.616]  But I'm glad he's the first caller to call in.
[02:08:06.616 --> 02:08:10.837]  And we'll go to Kevin and A-Boss and Robert and everybody else.
[02:08:10.837 --> 02:08:12.477]  And Zach, I'll get you on as a guest.
[02:08:12.477 --> 02:08:17.198]  I mean, I looked up and noticed you've been sitting there for 14 minutes, so I appreciate you holding.
[02:08:17.198 --> 02:08:18.799]  And I know a lot of wild stuff's going on.
[02:08:18.799 --> 02:08:23.640]  I mean, you told me you'll soon see Kanye at the White House.
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:25.180]  You said that culture will speak.
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.301]  And you've not predicted.
[02:08:27.301 --> 02:08:31.583]  You know a lot of what's coming and what's going to be unfolding.
[02:08:31.583 --> 02:08:45.029]  And so, 25 days out, my friend, from this historic crossroads election, you want to connect the dots with Nikki Haley, Michelle Obama, a Vint, and more.
[02:08:45.029 --> 02:08:45.789]  So thanks for coming on.
[02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:49.791]  First and foremost, it's a pleasure to be back on.
[02:08:49.791 --> 02:08:51.331]  I apologize for my absence.
[02:08:51.331 --> 02:08:52.872]  I have a lot of things going on.
[02:08:52.872 --> 02:08:55.973]  It's a very complex country and a very complex situation.
[02:08:55.973 --> 02:09:09.897]  But yes, like we predicted last year, and you know, YouTube has done a very good job of wiping what we said last year off.
[02:09:09.897 --> 02:09:14.038]  But on your broadcast, I said, in resignation, in that order,
[02:09:14.625 --> 02:09:16.225]  Bannon will be gone.
[02:09:16.225 --> 02:09:17.866]  Haley will be gone.
[02:09:17.866 --> 02:09:19.646]  Tillerson will be gone.
[02:09:19.646 --> 02:09:21.126]  Sessions is next.
[02:09:21.126 --> 02:09:22.446]  Watch my words.
[02:09:22.446 --> 02:09:25.407]  And I have some information about Haley.
[02:09:25.407 --> 02:09:27.467]  I have some information about this.
[02:09:27.467 --> 02:09:30.828]  But make no mistake.
[02:09:30.828 --> 02:09:33.688]  I was dealing with some personal things, so I had to deal with it.
[02:09:33.688 --> 02:09:36.409]  But now I'm in a much better place now.
[02:09:36.409 --> 02:09:38.929]  And let's just say this.
[02:09:38.929 --> 02:09:41.690]  A very big event is being planned.
[02:09:41.690 --> 02:09:42.830]  And there's going to be some speakers.
[02:09:43.917 --> 02:09:46.399]  Alex Jones is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:46.399 --> 02:09:48.781]  Roseanne Barr is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:51.303]  Louis Farrakhan is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:51.303 --> 02:09:53.445]  Kanye West is going to be a speaker.
[02:09:53.445 --> 02:09:55.566]  And I can guarantee that.
[02:09:55.566 --> 02:09:58.169]  Well, now you're letting the cat out of the bag, man.
[02:09:58.169 --> 02:09:59.189]  Oh, listen.
[02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.830]  I know, I know.
[02:09:59.830 --> 02:10:00.190]  Hey, I know.
[02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:07.096]  If they try to stop Kanye this time, because obviously he was coming here to the office and then they went crazy, I'll go ahead and release all this.
[02:10:07.096 --> 02:10:08.477]  But why are you releasing all this right now?
[02:10:09.451 --> 02:10:10.251]  Because it has to happen.
[02:10:10.251 --> 02:10:14.794]  By the way, I was about to say, why didn't you just call Dario, the producers, we'd have put you on Skype, better audio.
[02:10:14.794 --> 02:10:17.035]  I mean, you could have called here if you wanted to come on.
[02:10:17.035 --> 02:10:21.018]  I know, a lot of things are happening, and this is what's going to occur.
[02:10:21.018 --> 02:10:22.619]  This is what's going to occur.
[02:10:22.619 --> 02:10:25.260]  If we want to do the reveal right now, I'll do the reveal right now.
[02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:26.821]  Is that the best thing Zach?
[02:10:26.821 --> 02:10:28.262]  Because usually you hold back.
[02:10:28.262 --> 02:10:29.883]  Maybe we shouldn't do the reveal.
[02:10:29.883 --> 02:10:32.504]  Let's hold up until we talk today, okay?
[02:10:32.504 --> 02:10:33.205]  Okay.
[02:10:33.205 --> 02:10:34.706]  We'll do the reveal right there.
[02:10:34.706 --> 02:10:35.066]  Okay.
[02:10:35.066 --> 02:10:37.567]  But just make no mistake, folks.
[02:10:37.567 --> 02:10:38.788]  Like we said last year,
[02:10:39.645 --> 02:10:41.026]  Or earlier this year, rather.
[02:10:41.026 --> 02:10:42.547]  Culture will speak.
[02:10:42.547 --> 02:10:53.352]  And notice as Kanye used the term Chiraq, and maybe a lot of these listeners don't understand what that means, but that's about culture, that's about mingos, that's about rap.
[02:10:53.352 --> 02:10:56.594]  Culture will speak, and culture did speak.
[02:10:56.594 --> 02:11:01.657]  And there was a lot of things behind the scenes that were occurring at the White House that I was very proud to see.
[02:11:02.304 --> 02:11:08.826]  That I had a lot to do with, that a lot of people I knew had a lot to do with, and we're very proud of it, we're very happy about it.
[02:11:08.826 --> 02:11:11.847]  What we're not happy about is the attack on Elon Musk.
[02:11:11.847 --> 02:11:14.748]  What we're not happy about is the attack on Alex Jones.
[02:11:14.748 --> 02:11:16.808]  It's an absolute disgrace in this country.
[02:11:16.808 --> 02:11:29.132]  It will be addressed, and quite frankly, what it might be- Well, I was told separately, I was told separately by the CIA and the Pentagon, in person and over the phone, that Trump, they said, don't worry, they're gonna pay.
[02:11:30.575 --> 02:11:32.397]  Well, there's no real worry.
[02:11:32.397 --> 02:11:39.264]  I think what it's doing is exposing sort of an error in the system of corporatism.
[02:11:39.264 --> 02:11:44.108]  An error in the system of economic advertising.
[02:11:44.108 --> 02:11:46.330]  Meaning, we can make our own revenue.
[02:11:46.330 --> 02:11:47.812]  We can generate our own bandwidth.
[02:11:48.032 --> 02:11:49.373]  We could have our own reach.
[02:11:49.373 --> 02:11:50.373]  We don't need them.
[02:11:50.373 --> 02:11:54.275]  No, I agree, but let's get to Nikki Haley, because that's what's really important.
[02:11:54.275 --> 02:12:01.759]  I was told, not just by you, but others, that she's the mole, and that Trump let her go in a nice way, and you did say that last year first.
[02:12:01.759 --> 02:12:02.880]  I got the clip, Dave.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.222]  Listen, I got it on the hard drive.
[02:12:06.222 --> 02:12:07.322]  I told you, Haley.
[02:12:07.322 --> 02:12:08.603]  I told you about Haley last year.
[02:12:09.423 --> 02:12:13.829]  She's a snake in the grass, she's a Ewing creature, and it's not going to be Hillary.
[02:12:13.829 --> 02:12:22.963]  Hillary will be there in essence, she'll be there to promote, she'll be on the podium, but it's going to be Michelle O.P., Nikki Haley running as Vice.
[02:12:23.539 --> 02:12:23.839]  And that's
[02:12:44.507 --> 02:12:55.073]  High level folks that have been in the meetings, unless they're putting out disinfo to fool the guys that are in the meetings, they're saying Hillary won't step down, refuses to, and that Michelle O is going to be VP.
[02:12:55.073 --> 02:12:56.194]  No.
[02:12:56.194 --> 02:13:00.236]  They won't let her do it because of what's been revealed about Bernie.
[02:13:00.236 --> 02:13:09.141]  What's been revealed about Bernie, and I implore individuals, first of all, I've had some conversations out there in the hills, out there in Calabasas,
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.861]  With Joe Rogan, about having you back on.
[02:13:11.861 --> 02:13:17.462]  But when he had Roseanne Barr on, and I implore people to listen to that, a lot of things were revealed.
[02:13:17.462 --> 02:13:27.585]  And what was done to Bernie Sanders, the true DNC members, who happen to be actual Democrats, who happen to be progressives, like they're actually progressives.
[02:13:27.585 --> 02:13:28.946]  They actually believe it.
[02:13:28.946 --> 02:13:32.086]  They're not happy about what occurred.
[02:13:32.086 --> 02:13:34.627]  He publicly won the nomination and they stole it.
[02:13:34.627 --> 02:13:37.568]  Publicly won it and they're not going to let her do a damn thing.
[02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:40.490]  And here's the big point.
[02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:43.390]  Oh my God, we could talk for hours, but here's the big point.
[02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:44.671]  Here's the big point.
[02:13:44.671 --> 02:13:52.632]  We have Kanye and Jim Brown, two of the most iconic African American individuals in the Oval Office, talking to the President of the United States of America.
[02:13:52.632 --> 02:13:54.333]  Here's my question.
[02:13:54.333 --> 02:13:56.833]  Where's the response from Barack Hussein?
[02:13:56.833 --> 02:13:57.333]  Where are you at?
[02:14:01.788 --> 02:14:02.688]  We know where you're at.
[02:14:02.688 --> 02:14:06.531]  Can you believe they're calling Kanye all these racist names?
[02:14:06.531 --> 02:14:09.173]  A minstrel, a dumb negro.
[02:14:09.173 --> 02:14:10.314]  I mean, I'm just outraged.
[02:14:10.314 --> 02:14:14.718]  It's sick to watch real racism and saying, oh, that's a dumb black man.
[02:14:14.718 --> 02:14:15.518]  He doesn't know anything.
[02:14:15.518 --> 02:14:16.799]  He's mentally ill.
[02:14:16.799 --> 02:14:18.141]  This is crazy.
[02:14:18.141 --> 02:14:26.547]  It's smarter because the Q community and this whole phenomenon, this whole problem, which is a farce and a guy really ran out of control.
[02:14:26.547 --> 02:14:26.607]  But
[02:14:28.072 --> 02:14:31.695]  They were calling for tribunals early and this and this and this.
[02:14:31.695 --> 02:14:34.297]  You can't do that that early because it causes chaos.
[02:14:34.297 --> 02:14:35.758]  You need to do it gradually.
[02:14:35.758 --> 02:14:46.327]  And what you're seeing is a gradual dismantling of the Democratic Party and the corrupt nature of the United States government that has been alive since about the 40s.
[02:14:46.327 --> 02:14:48.248]  And it's being done brilliantly.
[02:14:48.248 --> 02:14:53.672]  And what occurred in the Oval Office with Kanye West and Jim Brown was spectacular.
[02:14:53.672 --> 02:14:54.833]  It was very important.
[02:14:54.833 --> 02:14:55.674]  It was a critical part.
[02:14:56.431 --> 02:15:07.239]  The event that I'm putting together, the event that will shock the world, the event that will cause headlines for weeks, will also do that.
[02:15:07.239 --> 02:15:13.463]  And the type of stuff that we saw in the Oval Office will continue because the dialogue needs to continue.
[02:15:13.463 --> 02:15:14.864]  We are Americans.
[02:15:14.864 --> 02:15:16.385]  I don't care where you're from.
[02:15:16.385 --> 02:15:18.226]  I don't care what you think happened.
[02:15:18.226 --> 02:15:20.828]  I don't care what... There's never been a better model.
[02:15:20.828 --> 02:15:21.349]  Ever.
[02:15:21.349 --> 02:15:21.709]  Anywhere.
[02:15:23.956 --> 02:15:26.297]  I know I got loaded phone lines, but I'm going to get to everybody.
[02:15:26.297 --> 02:15:29.198]  But do a few more minutes, Zach, because I wish you'd have called in on Skype.
[02:15:29.198 --> 02:15:37.061]  And we were going to talk it to, briefly, and then I've got a big special report coming up, and I'll talk to you after that.
[02:15:37.061 --> 02:15:39.202]  And what he's saying is going on behind the scenes.
[02:15:39.202 --> 02:15:42.343]  And I trust Zach, because he usually holds pretty close to the vest.
[02:15:42.343 --> 02:15:44.343]  So I've got to talk to you during the break, if we can patch him through.
[02:15:44.343 --> 02:15:47.624]  I want to find out why in the world he's saying this on air.
[02:15:47.624 --> 02:15:52.026]  Because in my experience, that's not, well, we're going to find out what's going on.
[02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:58.071]  Ever wonder how Bitcoin and Ethereum were created?
[02:15:58.071 --> 02:16:02.953]  Vercell Media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own cryptocurrency.

[02:16:26.454 --> 02:16:30.377]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.377 --> 02:16:31.918]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.918 --> 02:16:34.881]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.881 --> 02:16:40.085]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:24.668 --> 02:17:31.031]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.031 --> 02:17:34.072]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.072 --> 02:17:39.975]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.975 --> 02:17:43.777]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.777 --> 02:17:45.038]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.038 --> 02:17:46.378]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.378 --> 02:17:52.581]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:20:31.719 --> 02:20:38.344]  I know who he is, who's identity he is, and some of the things he's done behind the scenes, and things that have unfolded.
[02:20:38.344 --> 02:20:40.505]  And so he is who he says he is.
[02:20:40.505 --> 02:20:51.593]  He does do what he says he's doing, and I can confirm some of the stuff he's been up to out in Las Vegas and out in Florida and out in L.A.
[02:20:51.593 --> 02:20:52.954]  as well.
[02:20:52.954 --> 02:20:55.336]  But just finishing up, I know we're winning.
[02:20:55.336 --> 02:20:56.196]  The country's coming back.
[02:20:57.245 --> 02:21:02.307]  This whole Democrat Party is being dismantled because they're a criminal group allied with Chi-Coms.
[02:21:02.307 --> 02:21:04.668]  Now everything we talked about years ago is now all over the news.
[02:21:04.668 --> 02:21:06.409]  The secret chips from China.
[02:21:06.409 --> 02:21:08.670]  Tim Cook, Apple, Google moving over there.
[02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:14.913]  The Pentagon is summoning Google next week to try to read the Riot Act to them.
[02:21:14.913 --> 02:21:18.014]  The fact that they already did this, you can't ever let them back into anything.
[02:21:18.014 --> 02:21:18.575]  They're criminals.
[02:21:19.255 --> 02:21:20.416]  They're censoring Americans.
[02:21:20.416 --> 02:21:26.159]  It isn't 800 conservative sites that were banned off Facebook and Twitter together yesterday.
[02:21:26.159 --> 02:21:32.322]  Now we're learning it's thousands and thousands with tens of millions of followers, you know, total or more.
[02:21:32.322 --> 02:21:34.103]  Some have millions of followers apiece.
[02:21:34.103 --> 02:21:36.184]  They're really making a serious criminal move.
[02:21:37.449 --> 02:21:43.392]  Twenty-five days out, they busted this guy with a 200-pound bomb, was going to blow stuff up because he's a Democrat.
[02:21:43.392 --> 02:21:48.794]  They've got the editor of Raw Story saying, you know, Scalise deserved it, we're defending ourselves.
[02:21:48.794 --> 02:21:52.796]  You've got the former Attorney General saying, we need to kick them, we need to attack conservatives.
[02:21:52.796 --> 02:21:58.759]  You've got Antifa blocking roads all over the country, trying to get run over, trying to have another Charlottesville.
[02:21:58.759 --> 02:22:02.441]  So, all I'm saying, Zach, is you say big event.
[02:22:03.766 --> 02:22:06.308]  I think they know they're exponentially losing.
[02:22:06.308 --> 02:22:08.690]  I don't think they even want this election to happen.
[02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:14.235]  And they admittedly were going to try to have this bombing and others to suspend the election, and then claim it's Trump's fault.
[02:22:14.235 --> 02:22:25.424]  So just give us, from your perspective and your sources, and some of the people, some of the generals I know that you talk to, that talk to you, that authorize you to come on the show, what are they thinking is going to be pulled?
[02:22:25.424 --> 02:22:33.110]  Because if we don't see there's about to be a big leprous attack... Here's the thing, here's the thing, this is why I haven't been on, this is why the show
[02:22:33.798 --> 02:22:38.463]  Yeah, on your platforms have been canceled because we compiled a timeline.
[02:22:38.463 --> 02:22:40.024]  What happened to Gaddafi?
[02:22:40.024 --> 02:22:41.746]  What happened at Vegas?
[02:22:41.746 --> 02:22:53.177]  What all these things that are unsolved that we cover, that InfoWars covers, with impeccable integrity, with impeccable journalistic integrity, what happened to those things?
[02:22:53.177 --> 02:22:55.640]  Oh, they just go unsolved and then the next thing happens.
[02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:56.921]  The next thing happens.
[02:22:56.921 --> 02:22:57.642]  Let me tell you something.
[02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:08.162]  You're not going to stop us now, because we have enough capital now, we have enough integrity now, we have a president in the White House now, that's not going to allow us to be stopped.
[02:23:08.752 --> 02:23:11.154]  The free market will thrive in this country.
[02:23:11.154 --> 02:23:13.095]  We do not need your platforms.
[02:23:13.095 --> 02:23:15.216]  If you want to de-platform us, great.
[02:23:15.216 --> 02:23:16.197]  We'll make our own platforms.
[02:23:16.197 --> 02:23:20.860]  No, I agree, but what do you make of them now not even calling it fake news, just not even claiming they did violations?
[02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:22.181]  With me, they claim violations.
[02:23:22.181 --> 02:23:31.707]  They just go, thousands of major newspapers and magazines and Michelle Malkin, everybody else, you're just totally banned with millions of followers apiece because we say you're spam.
[02:23:31.707 --> 02:23:33.448]  We don't like your politics.
[02:23:33.448 --> 02:23:34.268]  Oh, good.
[02:23:34.268 --> 02:23:35.629]  I got some keywords for them.
[02:23:35.629 --> 02:23:36.990]  I got some keywords for them real quick.
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.883]  Um, what's up with Huma Abedin and Lucy Graham?
[02:23:40.883 --> 02:23:42.044]  Look at that footage.
[02:23:42.044 --> 02:23:43.825]  Oops!
[02:23:43.825 --> 02:23:44.846]  People forgot about that.
[02:23:44.846 --> 02:23:45.947]  Go ahead and Google that.
[02:23:45.947 --> 02:23:47.148]  Now people are Googling that.
[02:23:47.148 --> 02:23:48.008]  Good.
[02:23:48.008 --> 02:23:49.870]  You do not want me back on the platform.
[02:23:49.870 --> 02:23:50.791]  I'm telling you.
[02:23:50.791 --> 02:23:52.312]  These people are not playing with us.
[02:23:52.984 --> 02:23:54.986]  They're not playing with us, and we're not playing with them.
[02:23:54.986 --> 02:23:58.009]  We are in a full-out war, and we're going to win the war.
[02:23:58.009 --> 02:24:04.395]  I agree, but doesn't it show how desperate they are, Zach, that they were planning to still do this incrementally over the next few years?
[02:24:04.395 --> 02:24:06.196]  They're desperate, but they're weak.
[02:24:06.196 --> 02:24:07.397]  I know, I listen.
[02:24:07.397 --> 02:24:10.620]  Sometimes my little nephew gets desperate, but I'm like, calm down, buddy.
[02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:12.522]  Calm down.
[02:24:12.522 --> 02:24:14.244]  Calm down.
[02:24:14.244 --> 02:24:16.586]  They're desperate, but they're weak.
[02:24:16.586 --> 02:24:17.647]  They will not win.
[02:24:18.231 --> 02:24:22.674]  We will prevail, culture will speak, and you will not stop us.
[02:24:22.674 --> 02:24:27.318]  And what we have... Well, I think they figured that out now, Zach.
[02:24:27.318 --> 02:24:30.180]  I think they figured that out now, but they're not going to give up.
[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:34.503]  So, at a certain point, I believe in our free market, and I believe in due process.
[02:24:34.503 --> 02:24:38.526]  They're an outside group with CHICOM funding attacking us.
[02:24:38.526 --> 02:24:44.331]  At a certain point, we're in dereliction of duty, and we don't tell the President, it's time to just deal with these people.
[02:24:44.957 --> 02:24:45.698]  The President knows.
[02:24:45.698 --> 02:24:47.159]  The President knows.
[02:24:47.159 --> 02:24:48.680]  We're behind the scenes at SimCom.
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:51.482]  We know what's going on.
[02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:52.262]  Listen.
[02:24:52.262 --> 02:24:53.263]  There's channels.
[02:24:53.263 --> 02:24:54.564]  There's communication.
[02:24:54.564 --> 02:24:55.625]  It's strategic.
[02:24:55.625 --> 02:24:56.926]  It's happening slowly.
[02:24:56.926 --> 02:24:58.107]  It seems weird.
[02:24:58.107 --> 02:24:59.488]  And it's unfair right now.
[02:24:59.488 --> 02:25:00.609]  It is unfair right now.
[02:25:00.609 --> 02:25:01.669]  But make no mistake.
[02:25:01.669 --> 02:25:03.771]  In the end, we will prevail.
[02:25:03.771 --> 02:25:07.133]  And at the very end of the day, we're going to create even more capital.
[02:25:07.133 --> 02:25:10.556]  So if they want to try to hold something over our head, good luck.
[02:25:10.556 --> 02:25:11.917]  Because you're not going to do nothing.
[02:25:11.917 --> 02:25:14.139]  You're not holding nothing over our head.
[02:25:14.139 --> 02:25:14.439]  Nothing.
[02:25:15.727 --> 02:25:20.869]  Haven't they figured out yet that, like a game of chicken, we're not blinking and that they don't make it out of this?
[02:25:20.869 --> 02:25:24.151]  I mean, there's no scenario where the Globalists win now.
[02:25:24.151 --> 02:25:25.071]  I mean, they're done.
[02:25:25.071 --> 02:25:26.031]  Exactly.
[02:25:26.031 --> 02:25:26.812]  And I'm going to end with this.
[02:25:26.812 --> 02:25:36.636]  I mean, you have other callers and a show to do here, but what we also have, and I have to just drop this in, we might have to, like, schedule another appearance for me and I'll do the whole thing.
[02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:51.398]  I'm talking about Space Force and continuing to talk about Space Force, but what people aren't talking about, because it gets buried by just like political sort of counterculture, pop culture stuff.
[02:25:51.398 --> 02:25:54.199]  What happened over the skies of China?
[02:25:54.199 --> 02:25:56.581]  Oh yeah, put up that incredible image.
[02:25:56.581 --> 02:26:01.224]  You have a hypersonic nuclear weapon, which is pre-orbit.
[02:26:01.224 --> 02:26:02.265]  Oh, no big deal.
[02:26:02.265 --> 02:26:03.605]  No big deal.
[02:26:03.605 --> 02:26:05.046]  There's no space war.
[02:26:05.046 --> 02:26:06.327]  No big deal.
[02:26:06.327 --> 02:26:07.408]  Are you guys out of your mind?
[02:26:08.103 --> 02:26:10.925]  You're more worried about Kanye wearing the hat, which is great.
[02:26:10.925 --> 02:26:12.827]  Which, culturally, we're gonna do it.
[02:26:12.827 --> 02:26:14.128]  We're gonna make things happen.
[02:26:14.128 --> 02:26:16.029]  And that's how we have to do things on the ground.
[02:26:16.029 --> 02:26:17.811]  But make no mistake.
[02:26:17.811 --> 02:26:21.814]  Within the continuity of government, there's actual things occurring.
[02:26:21.814 --> 02:26:22.774]  Period.
[02:26:22.774 --> 02:26:24.676]  Technologically, things are occurring.
[02:26:24.676 --> 02:26:32.922]  And they want to demonize Elon Musk and bury him and bury the DAO and do all this stuff because he talks his mind, speaks his mind.
[02:26:32.922 --> 02:26:33.623]  He's a genius.
[02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:35.609]  Stop hating on people!
[02:26:35.609 --> 02:26:40.571]  Well, I mean, he was exposing the AI gods and the globalist takeover plan, so he had to be punished.
[02:26:40.571 --> 02:26:42.551]  Listen, when I'm off the air, Zach, I'll call you right away.
[02:26:42.551 --> 02:26:43.031]  God bless.
[02:26:43.031 --> 02:26:44.312]  We appreciate you coming on.
[02:26:44.312 --> 02:26:49.613]  But yeah, get into what that was that went off last night.
[02:26:49.613 --> 02:26:59.375]  I've seen the famous footage in Trinity and beyond, where they're detonating atomic weapons in the atmosphere, and that... Not good.
[02:26:59.375 --> 02:27:00.276]  Not good.
[02:27:00.276 --> 02:27:00.956]  Pretty morbid, too.
[02:27:02.085 --> 02:27:05.846]  Call me when the show's over.
[02:27:05.846 --> 02:27:07.606]  We'll talk.
[02:27:07.606 --> 02:27:08.807]  I promise an appearance.
[02:27:08.807 --> 02:27:09.807]  And you know what?
[02:27:09.807 --> 02:27:11.147]  We'll do the full reveal.
[02:27:11.147 --> 02:27:13.448]  Because at this point, who cares?
[02:27:13.448 --> 02:27:14.388]  I'm all in.
[02:27:14.388 --> 02:27:14.788]  I'm all in.
[02:27:14.788 --> 02:27:15.428]  Well, God bless you.
[02:27:15.428 --> 02:27:16.769]  I'll call you after the show.
[02:27:16.769 --> 02:27:17.169]  Thank you, Shaq.
[02:27:17.169 --> 02:27:18.209]  We're gonna go to calls now.
[02:27:18.209 --> 02:27:19.729]  That happens sometimes when somebody calls in.
[02:27:19.729 --> 02:27:20.590]  I promise I'll get to everybody.
[02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:21.650]  I apologize.
[02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:27.311]  But what exactly is this mysterious light that's spotted in the high skies of China?
[02:27:27.311 --> 02:27:28.812]  Go ahead and scroll down now.
[02:27:28.812 --> 02:27:29.612]  And if you look at
[02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:46.287]  Detonations in space of atomic or nuclear weapons, that is exactly what they look like in US military air force footage of nuclear weapons detonating in space.
[02:27:46.287 --> 02:27:51.893]  So... And then of course you've got whatever they blew up.
[02:27:54.366 --> 02:27:57.308]  The debris of it sinking down.
[02:27:57.308 --> 02:28:03.073]  But that is a very sophisticated, very sophisticated weapon.
[02:28:03.073 --> 02:28:07.717]  Because, well, you can see the initial detonation point.
[02:28:07.717 --> 02:28:11.500]  It's some type of chain reaction weapon.
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:14.683]  Probably, that looks almost like an antimatter pellet or something.
[02:28:17.245 --> 02:28:19.846]  This is wild.
[02:28:19.846 --> 02:28:23.107]  I'm sure the Chinese are happy right now.
[02:28:23.107 --> 02:28:26.928]  All right, we're going to go to break and I promise I'm going to wrap back to your calls.
[02:28:26.928 --> 02:28:31.470]  Don't forget, we are not in Kansas anymore and InfoWars needs your support.
[02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:39.052]  Plus, we've got supplements of the best out there and we have free shipping store wide and 50% off all the supplements.
[02:28:39.052 --> 02:28:41.133]  T-shirts, books, videos are all there.
[02:28:41.133 --> 02:28:43.254]  Big discounts across the board and sign up for auto ship.
[02:28:43.254 --> 02:28:43.674]  Additional 10% off.
[02:28:45.069 --> 02:28:52.021]  That makes a lot of these lost leaders, but the enemy's trying to shut us down, so I'm selling everything out of the warehouse, so we got a backup provision.
[02:28:52.021 --> 02:28:52.742]  Thanks for the support.
[02:28:55.390 --> 02:28:56.590]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.590 --> 02:29:00.531]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:02.051]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.051 --> 02:29:05.012]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.012 --> 02:29:10.573]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.573 --> 02:29:11.773]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.773 --> 02:29:14.713]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:14.713 --> 02:29:16.934]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:16.934 --> 02:29:21.374]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:21.374 --> 02:29:23.675]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:31.821]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[02:29:31.821 --> 02:29:36.082]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[02:29:36.082 --> 02:29:40.703]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[02:29:46.404 --> 02:29:46.744]  GoBerkey.com.
[02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:58.761]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:29:58.761 --> 02:30:00.921]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:30:00.921 --> 02:30:04.862]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:30:04.862 --> 02:30:16.345]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:30:16.345 --> 02:30:25.468]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:30:25.948 --> 02:30:31.736]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:30:31.736 --> 02:30:37.183]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:30:37.183 --> 02:30:39.446]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:30:39.446 --> 02:30:40.588]  Buy these!
[02:30:40.588 --> 02:30:41.449]  Sold out in a month!
[02:30:42.284 --> 02:30:46.608]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:31:05.243 --> 02:31:16.075]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:31:16.075 --> 02:31:18.198]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:31:18.198 --> 02:31:22.202]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:22.202 --> 02:31:23.224]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:31:23.644 --> 02:31:29.428]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:31:29.428 --> 02:31:31.830]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:37.253]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:31:37.253 --> 02:31:40.235]  Infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[02:31:40.235 --> 02:31:48.961]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:31:48.961 --> 02:31:53.384]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:31:55.865 --> 02:31:56.045]  Yes.
[02:32:26.625 --> 02:32:29.046]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[02:32:29.046 --> 02:32:30.747]  Ordered it six months ago.
[02:32:30.747 --> 02:32:31.768]  So I get the price down.
[02:32:31.768 --> 02:32:33.508]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:32:33.508 --> 02:32:34.749]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:32:34.749 --> 02:32:36.710]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:39.091]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:40.551]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[02:32:40.551 --> 02:32:42.892]  I'm sure it's viable shield X2.
[02:32:42.892 --> 02:32:44.373]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[02:32:44.373 --> 02:32:46.354]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[02:32:46.354 --> 02:32:49.075]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[02:32:49.075 --> 02:32:50.916]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[02:32:50.916 --> 02:32:52.357]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:32:52.357 --> 02:32:54.057]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[02:32:54.057 --> 02:32:55.298]  InfoWarshore.com right now.
[02:32:59.768 --> 02:33:02.384]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.259 --> 02:33:16.521]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:33:16.521 --> 02:33:17.881]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.881 --> 02:33:22.023]  All right, let me just say this again because I couldn't say it enough.
[02:33:22.023 --> 02:33:33.768]  Thank you, audience, for being in the arena and being a radio TV audience that's actually changing the world with your support of what we do, but also what you do word of mouth and your courage to stand up for what's right.
[02:33:33.768 --> 02:33:34.808]  You're amazing.
[02:33:34.808 --> 02:33:36.449]  Don't thank me when we take these calls.
[02:33:36.449 --> 02:33:37.809]  You are amazing.
[02:33:37.809 --> 02:33:38.890]  You are incredible.
[02:33:40.538 --> 02:33:44.179]  Love will tell you all day what crap you are, how racist you are, to demoralize you.
[02:33:44.179 --> 02:33:52.223]  I'm telling you you're awesome because you are, and we're changing the world, and it's real, and it's happening.
[02:33:52.223 --> 02:33:55.244]  And I'm very thankful for all your prayers.
[02:33:55.244 --> 02:34:00.786]  Real prayer has been answered on so many fronts here, and we're still in
[02:34:02.213 --> 02:34:09.684]  The Woods here, but I can see the opening to the beautiful field out there where all of our children are going.
[02:34:09.684 --> 02:34:12.689]  We may not make it out to that field, but our kids are going to go there.
[02:34:12.689 --> 02:34:14.431]  And that's really what matters.
[02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:15.573]  And that's what this is really all about.
[02:34:16.731 --> 02:34:25.335]  is that commitment to something bigger and we're individuals but there is a collective in God's greater plan and I'm just very thankful to all of you.
[02:34:25.335 --> 02:34:29.057]  Please keep praying for us because I just want to execute better.
[02:34:29.057 --> 02:34:30.078]  Man, I'm up here a lot.
[02:34:30.078 --> 02:34:37.581]  I'm covering a lot and I just get mad at myself because there's so much I don't get to and then I'm always mad at myself, truthfully.
[02:34:37.581 --> 02:34:40.403]  That kind of spills over to the crew and that they're doing a great job.
[02:34:40.403 --> 02:34:41.783]  I just, this is so epic.
[02:34:41.783 --> 02:34:42.284]  How do you
[02:34:43.846 --> 02:34:45.587]  How do you fight this?
[02:34:45.587 --> 02:34:49.268]  What words do you come up with to what these people do?
[02:34:49.268 --> 02:34:53.489]  Because they're indescribably evil.
[02:34:53.489 --> 02:34:59.291]  And we're handicapped in this because we're not like that.
[02:34:59.291 --> 02:35:03.132]  You know, we would be depressed if we cheated on our wife or husband.
[02:35:03.132 --> 02:35:07.393]  Or if we did something corrupt or we said something mean to somebody that didn't deserve it.
[02:35:07.393 --> 02:35:08.754]  We have a conscience.
[02:35:08.754 --> 02:35:10.834]  They don't have any conscience.
[02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:11.815]  They have no governor.
[02:35:11.815 --> 02:35:12.635]  They have no bottom.
[02:35:14.417 --> 02:35:16.678]  There's no basement.
[02:35:16.678 --> 02:35:18.178]  To quote Lee Stranahan.
[02:35:18.178 --> 02:35:22.800]  The left isn't the left.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.840]  They are the left-hand path.
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:25.180]  They're not liberals.
[02:35:25.180 --> 02:35:31.422]  They're just selfish sociopaths and psychopaths that know that we have a conscience.
[02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:36.364]  And so they're trying to program us because we have feelings.
[02:35:36.364 --> 02:35:42.086]  And so we have to not have feelings for what they do and have feelings for our children and our culture and God.
[02:35:43.422 --> 02:35:46.384]  But not let them manipulate us.
[02:35:46.384 --> 02:35:47.765]  You have to learn to not have feelings.
[02:35:47.765 --> 02:35:50.647]  That's what they can't stand is, I don't care what they say or do to me.
[02:35:50.647 --> 02:35:52.489]  I just know they're liars.
[02:35:52.489 --> 02:35:53.670]  We're going to defeat them.
[02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:54.991]  People say, how do you handle all these attacks?
[02:35:54.991 --> 02:35:57.472]  It's a bunch of criminals.
[02:35:57.472 --> 02:36:02.596]  You know, if some child molester was in prison saying bad things about me, why would I care?
[02:36:02.596 --> 02:36:06.419]  Well, these child molesters and people, they mean nothing to me.
[02:36:06.419 --> 02:36:07.920]  I want them out of my life.
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:10.202]  But they won't leave me alone.
[02:36:10.202 --> 02:36:11.683]  So, I will crush them.
[02:36:14.104 --> 02:36:15.604]  And that's what this exercise is.
[02:36:15.604 --> 02:36:19.425]  I'm here to wage war on Soros and Hillary.
[02:36:19.425 --> 02:36:22.446]  I expect to be attacked.
[02:36:22.446 --> 02:36:25.607]  I expect to fight.
[02:36:25.607 --> 02:36:28.347]  And I expect to be destroyed.
[02:36:28.347 --> 02:36:31.868]  Because I intend to go where the action is.
[02:36:31.868 --> 02:36:37.509]  I intend to go into every battle and every place I can, whenever I can, as many times as I can.
[02:36:37.509 --> 02:36:41.350]  And I don't expect, in the great final continuum,
[02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:54.357]  Because shaving my ass means my children and this country and the world fails.
[02:36:54.357 --> 02:36:57.520]  And then we lose it all.
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:04.027]  And once you realize, think about losing humanity, their children, their future, then you're like, I don't care about me.
[02:37:04.027 --> 02:37:05.448]  Exactly!
[02:37:05.448 --> 02:37:09.293]  Because it's all about the continuum and stopping things like this.
[02:37:11.274 --> 02:37:12.494]  That's an abomination.
[02:37:12.494 --> 02:37:14.015]  That will not rule us.
[02:37:14.015 --> 02:37:15.355]  This will not control us.
[02:37:15.355 --> 02:37:16.655]  That will not control us.
[02:37:16.655 --> 02:37:21.536]  These husk, these demon-possessed monsters, they will fall forever!
[02:37:21.536 --> 02:37:26.337]  It won't always be the season of them crouched over our children, lapping up their blood.
[02:37:26.337 --> 02:37:29.638]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls and I apologize.
[02:37:29.638 --> 02:37:31.918]  I'm gonna get to everybody, but I gotta get to everybody quick now.
[02:37:31.918 --> 02:37:35.559]  A-Boss, Sam, David, everybody.
[02:37:35.559 --> 02:37:37.600]  We're gonna go to A-Boss in Idaho.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.160]  What's the Dems' next move, A-Boss?
[02:37:41.124 --> 02:37:46.385]  Well, I just want to say that I really agree with Zach, that we are winning, okay?
[02:37:46.385 --> 02:37:49.146]  And we have to really, really believe that.
[02:37:49.146 --> 02:37:55.287]  But we are winning, but the enemy can go and blow up a whole school full of kids and blame it on us.
[02:37:55.287 --> 02:37:57.308]  So what do we do when they do that?
[02:37:57.308 --> 02:37:58.848]  Well, and that's what I'm coming to.
[02:37:58.848 --> 02:38:04.510]  I honestly believe that what they're going to do... You know, you've been talking about the plan for the attack on the press.
[02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:07.110]  You know, I honestly don't think that they have the guts for that.
[02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:09.791]  Because first off, they might get injured in it, but they honestly...
[02:38:10.345 --> 02:38:12.006]  The false flag situation isn't working.
[02:38:12.006 --> 02:38:13.568]  There's too many eyes out there.
[02:38:13.568 --> 02:38:21.474]  But what I do think is going to happen is that this red wave is going to occur and it is going to make these people literally go crazy.
[02:38:21.474 --> 02:38:22.875]  They're going to be out in the streets.
[02:38:22.875 --> 02:38:32.003]  And Alex, do you remember back when, in the Ukraine war, when it first started, okay, those people were out protesting against the police.
[02:38:32.003 --> 02:38:32.564]  What did they do?
[02:38:32.564 --> 02:38:34.145]  They got those dang Maidan.
[02:38:34.145 --> 02:38:36.026]  Do you remember the Maidan out there?
[02:38:36.026 --> 02:38:38.829]  Those Nazi Maidan, Euro Maidan, whatever you want to call them?
[02:38:39.454 --> 02:38:43.937]  And they started firing into themselves, into their own protesters, to get them riled up.
[02:38:43.937 --> 02:38:45.778]  The cops were forced to stay out there.
[02:38:45.778 --> 02:38:48.520]  They had to be there, because that was their job.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:55.784]  And then finally, after they got the crowd riled up enough, they started shooting into the freaking cops to demoralize them, basically, and cause fear.
[02:38:55.784 --> 02:39:02.909]  So I honestly believe that they are going to follow the same George Soros plan that they've been following this entire time.
[02:39:03.331 --> 02:39:04.172]  It is a playbook.
[02:39:04.172 --> 02:39:08.795]  These people have such limited vision and no imagination.
[02:39:08.795 --> 02:39:12.939]  And I can tell you right now, it's enraging to watch how many lemmings are out on the street.
[02:39:12.939 --> 02:39:14.920]  It makes me sick.
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:16.642]  What do you think?
[02:39:16.642 --> 02:39:18.203]  Man, you're on fire, eh, boss?
[02:39:18.203 --> 02:39:19.084]  We could keep going.
[02:39:19.084 --> 02:39:27.911]  That's how they took down Ukraine, with staging attacks on their own Nazi forces, and our own liberal media then backed literal Nazis taking over Ukraine.
[02:39:29.536 --> 02:39:30.137]  Absolutely!
[02:39:30.137 --> 02:39:35.661]  I mean, these people really can't think two steps ahead.
[02:39:35.661 --> 02:39:37.963]  I know you want to worry about, you know, are we going to win?
[02:39:37.963 --> 02:39:38.724]  Are we going to win?
[02:39:38.724 --> 02:39:39.585]  How are we going to do it?
[02:39:39.585 --> 02:39:41.306]  Because, you know, what you were just saying.
[02:39:41.306 --> 02:39:44.088]  But honestly, we are winning, okay?
[02:39:44.088 --> 02:39:45.710]  And we're not really winning by our own
[02:39:47.371 --> 02:39:51.616]  We're carrying the fire of God, and you know, a lot of people out there get turned off when you start talking about God.
[02:39:51.616 --> 02:39:58.043]  I'm not going to shove it down their throats, but I'm telling you that right now, unless we walk with God in this, we will lose.
[02:39:58.043 --> 02:40:02.047]  And so we have to, every step, realize that we aren't the ones winning this.
[02:40:02.047 --> 02:40:05.531]  That we have to give it over to God, and He is going to win it for us.
[02:40:05.531 --> 02:40:06.352]  Alright?
[02:40:06.352 --> 02:40:07.073]  And you, my friend,
[02:40:07.529 --> 02:40:12.512]  I'm telling you, of all the years I've been watching you, I absolutely love you and your crew.
[02:40:12.512 --> 02:40:14.233]  And, you know, I've been praying for you.
[02:40:14.233 --> 02:40:18.315]  And what you're going through, you know, do not let them get you down.
[02:40:18.315 --> 02:40:19.955]  Do not let them get you down.
[02:40:19.955 --> 02:40:23.097]  Because you are going to come out of this squeaky clean.
[02:40:23.097 --> 02:40:23.397]  Alright?
[02:40:23.397 --> 02:40:26.519]  You will be remembered as a true blazing hero.
[02:40:26.519 --> 02:40:27.219]  And you know what?
[02:40:27.219 --> 02:40:28.540]  There's very few of us out there.
[02:40:28.894 --> 02:40:31.676]  And I'm not as big-scaled as you are.
[02:40:31.676 --> 02:40:33.958]  But dang it, I am out there, I am tagging.
[02:40:33.958 --> 02:40:36.179]  I love those little stickers you guys send out with your products.
[02:40:36.179 --> 02:40:39.862]  Hey brother, it's the little people that are the big people.
[02:40:39.862 --> 02:40:41.823]  Okay?
[02:40:41.823 --> 02:40:45.686]  Listen, I just want my children to have a future, and you're right.
[02:40:45.686 --> 02:40:46.066]  You know what?
[02:40:46.066 --> 02:40:47.627]  I want my children to have a future too, man.
[02:40:47.627 --> 02:40:49.988]  And the globalists don't have any imagination, you're right.
[02:40:49.988 --> 02:40:50.969]  Beautiful call, A-Boss.
[02:40:50.969 --> 02:40:52.070]  Call back again.
[02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:53.231]  Well, that was powerful.
[02:40:53.231 --> 02:40:54.792]  Let's talk to Sam in North Carolina.
[02:40:54.792 --> 02:40:56.013]  Sam, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:40:56.013 --> 02:40:56.253]  Go ahead.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.701]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:40:58.701 --> 02:41:00.622]  What's up, brother?
[02:41:00.622 --> 02:41:04.805]  I just want to let you know that I was a former leftist in college.
[02:41:04.805 --> 02:41:08.367]  I ended up joining the Young Democratic Socialists, and I apologize.
[02:41:08.367 --> 02:41:10.349]  I'm walking to class right now.
[02:41:10.349 --> 02:41:15.352]  But these people are so radicalized and so insane.
[02:41:15.352 --> 02:41:22.357]  What you're speaking on earlier, what Abbas was talking about earlier, these people will try to revolt and cause a civil war.
[02:41:22.357 --> 02:41:22.937]  I know them.
[02:41:23.462 --> 02:41:35.171]  And if you look at what happened at UNC at Silent Sam, it was a Confederate monument dedicated to UNC students who went to go serve in the Civil War and died.
[02:41:35.171 --> 02:41:37.192]  And they toppled the monument.
[02:41:37.192 --> 02:41:42.316]  And the Confederate people showed up and they held their Confederate flags and the cops told them to leave.
[02:41:42.316 --> 02:41:46.959]  The cops also told the Democratic Socialist anarchist crowd to leave as well.
[02:41:46.959 --> 02:41:48.400]  What did they end up doing?
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.762]  They didn't leave and they tried to fight the cops!
[02:41:51.593 --> 02:42:00.441]  And so we have these radical leftist anarchists who are in the streets trying to fight and kill police officers and just say, oh, I'm just anti-racist.
[02:42:00.441 --> 02:42:03.164]  Because that's how they brand themselves.
[02:42:03.164 --> 02:42:09.670]  And then when they're hitting cars with batons because white people are on it, and it's whites hitting it, screaming, F white people.
[02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:12.933]  It's like old people driving by, they're beating their car with batons.
[02:42:12.933 --> 02:42:16.036]  You effing white person, this is total mental illness.
[02:42:17.187 --> 02:42:24.983]  It is a complete, total mental illness, and so what I've been doing on campus is I've been trying to instigate these people to show their true colors.
[02:42:25.810 --> 02:42:30.352]  I go into the free expression area, and I put, these guys want civil war.
[02:42:30.352 --> 02:42:33.994]  And they show up the next day and they say, hell yes we want civil war.
[02:42:33.994 --> 02:42:37.935]  We want to arm the poor, we want to arm the workers, and then we'll get civil war.
[02:42:37.935 --> 02:42:42.657]  They put two cops, and demonic, like they put pentagrams all over the place.
[02:42:42.657 --> 02:42:46.039]  And I'm letting the public- Oh, exactly, they're all into Satanism.
[02:42:46.039 --> 02:42:48.360]  Tell us about that real quick, Sam, we'll come back.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.342]  Oh yeah, if you look at the anti-foot guy that kicks the pro-livers in the head, they're all wearing pentagrams.
[02:42:55.100 --> 02:43:03.589]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.589 --> 02:43:05.070]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:09.775]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.775 --> 02:43:14.780]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:35.158]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.658 --> 02:43:39.643]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:44:56.772 --> 02:44:59.754]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[02:44:59.754 --> 02:45:02.356]  And Survival Silodex 2 is the pure iodine.
[02:45:02.356 --> 02:45:03.236]  No one else has this.
[02:45:03.236 --> 02:45:06.298]  From deep earth, crystals between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[02:45:06.298 --> 02:45:07.779]  It's very hard for me to get.
[02:45:07.779 --> 02:45:09.660]  It's the good halogens.
[02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:11.782]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens.
[02:45:11.782 --> 02:45:18.326]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[02:45:18.326 --> 02:45:20.928]  BioTruth Selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[02:45:20.928 --> 02:45:22.349]  Selenium is an electrochemical.
[02:45:23.650 --> 02:45:29.375]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[02:45:29.375 --> 02:45:31.157]  So these go incredibly well together.
[02:45:31.157 --> 02:45:32.738]  We have a combo of those.
[02:45:32.738 --> 02:45:34.120]  Just experience it for yourself.
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:36.842]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[02:45:36.842 --> 02:45:37.883]  Very simple stuff.
[02:45:37.883 --> 02:45:39.505]  Filter your water.
[02:45:39.505 --> 02:45:41.607]  Yeah, I find myself selling water filters.
[02:45:41.607 --> 02:45:42.928]  Best out there for the price.
[02:45:42.928 --> 02:45:44.150]  When I say it's the last run,
[02:45:45.345 --> 02:45:46.946]  I think it'll be six months to a year until we get more.
[02:45:46.946 --> 02:45:47.767]  I hope we get more.
[02:45:47.767 --> 02:45:49.068]  This is the last run, it looks like.
[02:45:49.068 --> 02:45:49.968]  Survival Short X2.
[02:45:49.968 --> 02:45:55.832]  InfoWarsShort.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:45:55.832 --> 02:45:58.514]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:45:58.514 --> 02:46:04.858]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:46:04.858 --> 02:46:06.820]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:13.184]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:46:13.404 --> 02:46:13.684]  I think so.
[02:46:31.135 --> 02:46:31.595]  I think so.
[02:46:59.209 --> 02:47:01.814]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.252 --> 02:47:24.974]  Alex Jones here, back live, taking your phone calls.
[02:47:24.974 --> 02:47:29.176]  Fourth hour coming up with some extra treats and information.
[02:47:29.176 --> 02:47:44.163]  We've got on screen, if your TV viewer just did, just last week one of the well-known male feminists, whatever that means, wearing his pentagram, and then he roundhouse kicked a pro-life woman in the face.
[02:47:44.163 --> 02:47:46.924]  And it turned out he's been videotaped assaulting other women.
[02:47:48.217 --> 02:47:54.119]  The other video I haven't gotten to of leftists grabbing a woman saying, I'm going to rape you.
[02:47:54.119 --> 02:47:54.780]  And she goes, no.
[02:47:54.780 --> 02:48:01.382]  And they go, no, you're anti-woman, so we're going to rape you.
[02:48:01.382 --> 02:48:04.003]  And then feminists come over and defend it on video.
[02:48:04.003 --> 02:48:05.344]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:48:05.344 --> 02:48:09.185]  We had the reporter that was attacked on the show yesterday.
[02:48:09.185 --> 02:48:09.965]  And he's grabbing her.
[02:48:09.965 --> 02:48:12.106]  He's trying to get on her.
[02:48:12.106 --> 02:48:14.607]  But it's OK, because he's a liberal, so she's a Nazi.
[02:48:14.607 --> 02:48:15.948]  So it's all right.
[02:48:15.948 --> 02:48:16.728]  You've been dehumanized.
[02:48:18.001 --> 02:48:24.247]  But let's go ahead and roll some of this audio, actually, of the Roundhouse guy kicking the pro-life woman in the head.
[02:48:24.247 --> 02:48:27.349]  Do we have the audio with us?
[02:48:27.349 --> 02:48:27.810]  Oh, we don't.
[02:48:27.810 --> 02:48:33.255]  Okay, well, TV viewers can see it where he kicks her in the face right here.
[02:48:33.255 --> 02:48:43.144]  But going back to Sam in North Carolina, yes, the average tattoos and the average garb of a leftist
[02:48:44.504 --> 02:48:52.150]  Uh, is pentagrams and abortion worship and wanting to destroy reality and wanting to attack Christians.
[02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:56.232]  And so you're saying at your university that's what they're doing?
[02:48:56.232 --> 02:48:58.774]  Uh, and they're doing it publicly.
[02:48:58.774 --> 02:49:03.738]  Uh, it's not just like they're, they're going out in defense of what they stand for.
[02:49:03.738 --> 02:49:05.119]  They're going on the offense.
[02:49:05.119 --> 02:49:08.481]  They're saying, yes, we do want to cause civil war.
[02:49:08.481 --> 02:49:10.302]  Yes, this is everything that we believe in.
[02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:13.291]  You guys want civil war?
[02:49:13.291 --> 02:49:14.832]  Everybody called me delusional.
[02:49:14.832 --> 02:49:16.532]  They're like, oh, they don't want civil war.
[02:49:16.532 --> 02:49:17.833]  And then what do they come out and do?
[02:49:17.833 --> 02:49:20.114]  They go, hell yeah, we want civil war.
[02:49:20.114 --> 02:49:22.035]  It's absolute lunacy.
[02:49:22.035 --> 02:49:29.419]  If you remember two years back in North Carolina, the GOP headquarters in Orange County, I believe, got firebombed.
[02:49:29.419 --> 02:49:33.761]  They threw Molotov cocktails through the windows of the GOP headquarters.
[02:49:33.761 --> 02:49:37.683]  That happened two years ago, and I think a group of Democrats raised $13,000.
[02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:52.778]  Uh, in order to help rebuild, because, you know, after your political opponent gets firebombed, we all agree that firebombing is not a good political strategy, and so the community comes together to heal.
[02:49:52.778 --> 02:50:02.080]  These people have been angry for two years that the Democrats helped out the Republicans rebuild their firebombed headquarters.
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:06.441]  They go, how dare you support, I won't repeat what they call them, but
[02:50:06.986 --> 02:50:22.650]  It is absolutely insane that they endorse tactics such as firebombing your political opponents, calling for anarchy, giving guns to crackheads, and then they're like, oh yeah, we're the side of... What they want is power.
[02:50:22.650 --> 02:50:29.132]  What they want is to not do any work, be funded by Soros, with his rise-up garbage.
[02:50:29.132 --> 02:50:33.773]  But believe me, when they order them to go out and start killing, they're only going to be the cover.
[02:50:35.287 --> 02:50:37.228]  Yeah, Alex, good to talk with you.
[02:50:37.228 --> 02:50:39.328]  I've been listening for about 17 years, so it's great.
[02:50:39.328 --> 02:50:42.389]  What we wanted to bring up was the whole Kanye West thing and just
[02:51:05.146 --> 02:51:08.892]  I find it super disturbing how they're using the n-word on the news.
[02:51:08.892 --> 02:51:15.183]  It just kind of, to me, makes it... They want to try to keep black people with a victim mentality.
[02:51:15.183 --> 02:51:16.605]  Oh, and totally stirred up!
[02:51:16.605 --> 02:51:17.747]  I mean, it's so obvious!
[02:51:18.874 --> 02:51:25.419]  It really is, and I think that's kind of the Democrats' plan, is to kind of like keep them on the plantation.
[02:51:25.419 --> 02:51:29.182]  Anytime like a conservative black person... Well that's what Kanye's saying, and that's why they're pissed!
[02:51:29.182 --> 02:51:31.304]  They go, he's crazy, he's dumb!
[02:51:31.304 --> 02:51:34.787]  A year and a half ago he endorsed Trump, his own family had him thrown
[02:51:36.237 --> 02:51:43.483]  With the Baker Act, anybody can have it done, in a mental institution for a week, because he liked the President, who he already knew 10 years before!
[02:51:43.483 --> 02:51:45.584]  Kanye stayed at Trump's house!
[02:51:45.584 --> 02:51:47.966]  I know Jesse James real good, he's a great guy.
[02:51:47.966 --> 02:51:49.648]  He stayed at Trump's house many times.
[02:51:49.648 --> 02:51:51.289]  I know a bunch of folks know Trump.
[02:51:51.289 --> 02:51:53.431]  Trump is like super cool, man.
[02:51:53.431 --> 02:51:56.633]  Kanye's hung out and stayed with him over a decade ago.
[02:51:56.633 --> 02:51:59.035]  Kanye knows, he's played at his hotels.
[02:51:59.035 --> 02:52:01.797]  Kanye knows it's a load of BS.
[02:52:01.797 --> 02:52:05.180]  They were friends before, and what, he's not allowed to be his friend now?
[02:52:06.741 --> 02:52:07.682]  Oh, it's incredible.
[02:52:07.682 --> 02:52:10.764]  And then they use the terms like, you know, House Negro and Uncle Tom.
[02:52:10.764 --> 02:52:15.628]  Those are terms for blacks that left the plantation to go live in the master's house.
[02:52:15.628 --> 02:52:21.812]  And they want to just try to keep black people in that mentality of... Instead, how about we just leave the entire plantation?
[02:52:21.812 --> 02:52:22.873]  All of us.
[02:52:22.873 --> 02:52:24.114]  That's what Kanye's saying.
[02:52:24.114 --> 02:52:28.057]  Let's not be in the master's house because there is no plantation.
[02:52:28.057 --> 02:52:29.118]  Exactly.
[02:52:29.118 --> 02:52:31.760]  And if we can just get black people to understand that Trump just wants to
[02:52:32.196 --> 02:52:34.217]  Let them thrive and not just survive.
[02:52:34.217 --> 02:52:38.998]  Let the Democrats deal with their food stamps and all that stuff.
[02:52:38.998 --> 02:52:39.719]  No, you're right.
[02:52:39.719 --> 02:52:41.999]  It's just so sickening what they've done.
[02:52:41.999 --> 02:52:45.061]  And, you know, then, Kanye, you can only admire courage.
[02:52:45.061 --> 02:52:48.122]  You know, Jim Brown obviously has a lot of courage and has been conservative for a long time.
[02:52:48.122 --> 02:52:53.624]  But somebody like Kanye, you know, who's got everything to lose and they're coming after him, and he's not backing down.
[02:52:53.624 --> 02:52:54.484]  You can only admire that.
[02:52:54.484 --> 02:52:55.124]  God bless you, David.
[02:52:55.124 --> 02:52:56.645]  Good to hear from you.
[02:52:56.645 --> 02:52:59.246]  Juan in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:52:59.246 --> 02:52:59.846]  You're on the air.
[02:52:59.846 --> 02:53:00.146]  Go ahead.
[02:53:01.363 --> 02:53:02.763]  Hey, how's it going, Mr. Jones?
[02:53:02.763 --> 02:53:04.744]  My first time from San Antonio.
[02:53:04.744 --> 02:53:05.344]  Welcome, sir.
[02:53:05.344 --> 02:53:06.964]  Thanks for calling.
[02:53:06.964 --> 02:53:07.824]  Hey, well, thank you.
[02:53:07.824 --> 02:53:09.225]  Thank you for informing us.
[02:53:09.225 --> 02:53:28.469]  Listen, I was just calling because I just read a report on NPSdigest.com, and it mentions that how they're going to begin to set attacks here through these riots, but the way they're going to do it is they're going to start spilling acid on people.
[02:53:29.332 --> 02:53:44.133]  And so, from what I read was that Hillary Clinton met with the City of Mayer in London, and so they already did this in the city in London as well, and so... Yeah, there's like seven acid attacks a day in London.
[02:53:44.133 --> 02:53:44.934]  Right, correct.
[02:53:45.962 --> 02:53:56.190]  So, anyhow, I was just letting you know that, according to this is on NPSdigest.com, it's been very accurate, because before even InfoWars or anybody else started talking about how Ms.
[02:53:56.190 --> 02:54:00.013]  Ford was related to the CIA, I already had that information.
[02:54:00.013 --> 02:54:04.117]  So, they found that this website seems to be very trustworthy.
[02:54:04.117 --> 02:54:09.981]  Well, I mean, I want to ask myself, whoever the radical Islamist is, whatever, why would you
[02:54:10.762 --> 02:54:13.204]  Because they say randomly women are being attacked with acid.
[02:54:13.204 --> 02:54:16.046]  Good looking women that aren't wearing veils over their heads.
[02:54:16.046 --> 02:54:21.049]  And so you've got guys running around with buckets of acid that they cook up at their house, throwing it on a woman.
[02:54:21.049 --> 02:54:23.371]  It's like a, it's like an evil ritual.
[02:54:23.371 --> 02:54:26.233]  And so what are they, what's the reason?
[02:54:26.233 --> 02:54:29.095]  Like, why would you do that?
[02:54:29.095 --> 02:54:30.476]  Well, I don't know about the reason.
[02:54:30.476 --> 02:54:31.777]  You know, there's a lot of conflict.
[02:54:31.777 --> 02:54:34.318]  There's a lot of powerful institutions fighting among each other.
[02:54:34.318 --> 02:54:37.861]  You know, the war, you yourself know what's really going on behind the scenes, but
[02:54:38.419 --> 02:54:53.772]  Nevertheless, as a matter of fact, they told certain people from high powers of position from Russia here in the United States, who are here legally in the United States, not to attend these riots because there's going to be a lot of these type of terror attacks with acid.
[02:54:53.772 --> 02:54:56.315]  And so from what I understand is this is all planned.
[02:54:56.315 --> 02:55:01.919]  And according to this report, I'm not saying according to this report, because I don't want to be involved with slander, Ms.
[02:55:01.919 --> 02:55:02.360]  Clinton
[02:55:03.504 --> 02:55:05.469]  Well, I know this and I appreciate your call, Antifa!
[02:55:10.390 --> 02:55:15.352]  Defecates in plastic bags and urinates in it, and then lets it stew into a rotting stew.
[02:55:15.352 --> 02:55:18.153]  And a guy rode by when we were leaving, protesting the Democrats.
[02:55:18.153 --> 02:55:24.336]  They were having a ban Alex Jones off the air, ban all conservatives, literally, hosted by the city of Austin and Walmart.
[02:55:24.336 --> 02:55:28.698]  I'm sure Walmart didn't know, but it was actually called, you know, banning the conservatives meeting.
[02:55:28.698 --> 02:55:31.539]  And ban Alex Jones, ban Trump, you know, were fake news.
[02:55:31.539 --> 02:55:36.821]  And they mainly hit Owen and the other guy, Kyle.
[02:55:36.821 --> 02:55:37.762]  It only hit me a little bit.
[02:55:38.715 --> 02:55:43.018]  But he drove by on his bike with a bag and just threw it on us.
[02:55:43.018 --> 02:55:43.878]  And so that's what they do.
[02:55:43.878 --> 02:55:47.300]  They also, like, get HIV and then stick you with needles.
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:48.141]  That's what the left does.
[02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:51.763]  I mean, their main cities are just cesspits of feces everywhere.
[02:55:51.763 --> 02:55:54.845]  And they all wear, like, anti-swastika outfits.
[02:55:54.845 --> 02:55:57.867]  Meanwhile, they're funded by Jordan Soros, a literal Nazi.
[02:55:57.867 --> 02:55:59.928]  So it's just the irony is not lost.
[02:55:59.928 --> 02:56:00.388]  God bless you.
[02:56:00.388 --> 02:56:04.030]  Appreciate the call from San Antonio, Texas, my friend.
[02:56:04.030 --> 02:56:07.873]  Luke, Luke Skywalker, indeed you are powerful.
[02:56:08.353 --> 02:56:08.993]  From Idaho.
[02:56:08.993 --> 02:56:09.534]  You're on the air.
[02:56:09.534 --> 02:56:11.054]  Go ahead.
[02:56:11.054 --> 02:56:12.495]  How's it going, Mr. Jones?
[02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:13.595]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[02:56:13.595 --> 02:56:15.056]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:56:15.056 --> 02:56:18.357]  I mean, other than what's happening politically, a lot of good stuff's happening in my life.
[02:56:18.357 --> 02:56:22.139]  A lot of prayers are being answered, so thanks for all your support.
[02:56:22.139 --> 02:56:22.899]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:22.899 --> 02:56:23.960]  I am fired up.
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:24.800]  I'm out here in Boise.
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.042]  Me and my friends, we go downtown every single weekend.
[02:56:28.042 --> 02:56:31.043]  We play that Alex Jones folks song loud and proud.
[02:56:31.043 --> 02:56:31.843]  I'm out for people.
[02:56:31.843 --> 02:56:32.584]  We talk to people.
[02:56:32.584 --> 02:56:36.205]  Man, when you're talking to folks, you get one of two things.
[02:56:36.205 --> 02:56:37.926]  You get alive eyes.
[02:56:38.735 --> 02:56:44.698]  And they engage with you or they're just dead inside and there's like not really much middle ground these days.
[02:56:44.698 --> 02:56:54.524]  I was thinking about calling a new podcast I want to do weekly, Fire in the Eyes, because people either have the life or they're gone and you're absolutely right.
[02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:57.310]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:57.310 --> 02:56:58.792]  And, um, you know, we go down there.
[02:56:58.792 --> 02:56:59.632]  I've really been tapped.
[02:56:59.632 --> 02:57:04.336]  When you're saying, you know, you get that, you get tapped into the spirit and you can, you know, you really want to do good.
[02:57:04.336 --> 02:57:07.318]  I've been, I've been tapped into that, you know, sort of my whole life.
[02:57:07.318 --> 02:57:10.080]  I really started listening to you when I was, uh, 16.
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:19.166]  And then when I was 18, I got kicked off my broadcasting team in high school for trying to get some 9-11 truth out to my students, to my fellow students.
[02:57:19.166 --> 02:57:20.267]  But that's all long ago.
[02:57:20.267 --> 02:57:23.790]  I got a little prediction about what I think was going to happen to Hillary, if you'd like to hear.
[02:57:24.827 --> 02:57:25.308]  Stay there.
[02:57:25.308 --> 02:57:27.410]  We'll come right back with Luke in Idaho.
[02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:29.392]  Then we'll go to Mike and many others.
[02:57:29.392 --> 02:57:32.276]  And again, I always feel bad because we have like 25 phone lines.
[02:57:32.276 --> 02:57:34.198]  It's hard to always get to everybody, but we're trying.
[02:57:34.198 --> 02:57:37.121]  And we're doing a pretty good job going through the call, so we'll come back.
[02:57:37.121 --> 02:57:41.847]  Then I've got some excerpts of our nightly news coverage last night with myself and Owen Schroer.
[02:57:41.847 --> 02:57:44.510]  It's every night, 8 to 10 p.m., election coverage.

[03:00:15.224 --> 03:00:19.967]  Matt Drudge, he's rising Dem Superstar in veto.
[03:00:19.967 --> 03:00:22.668]  Could this be what the Dems have been waiting for?
[03:00:22.668 --> 03:00:28.471]  Yeah, he's got that fake, washbush, blueblood kind of retard talk and look.
[03:00:28.471 --> 03:00:30.733]  I mean, he's another piece of crap.
[03:00:30.733 --> 03:00:33.654]  So, he's perfect.
[03:00:33.654 --> 03:00:35.735]  And I'm not putting down mentally retarded children.
[03:00:35.735 --> 03:00:41.939]  I mean, there's something about bluebloods, and they're always like, can hardly talk, and they're real neurotic, and they're real stupid, and they always have like...
[03:00:43.462 --> 03:00:47.723]  Barrett teeth and you know, that's what the establishment likes.
[03:00:47.723 --> 03:00:50.544]  They're just soulless turd bags.
[03:00:50.544 --> 03:00:51.784]  Okay, I see I'm ranting.
[03:00:51.784 --> 03:00:53.225]  I'm so sick of hearing about Beto.
[03:00:53.225 --> 03:00:54.305]  I live in Austin.
[03:00:54.305 --> 03:00:57.606]  There's just Beto signs.
[03:00:57.606 --> 03:01:03.527]  I heard people are sticking Beto the pedo stickers on them or Beto the gun confiscator.
[03:01:03.527 --> 03:01:07.288]  People get stickers, they make it wherever they stick them on there.
[03:01:07.288 --> 03:01:09.569]  Because I'm really sick of this guy.
[03:01:09.569 --> 03:01:12.050]  He wants total open borders to ban people's guns.
[03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.950]  My God.
[03:01:14.494 --> 03:01:20.496]  And it's just, they're worshipping him like it's the second coming of a colostomy bag or something.
[03:01:20.496 --> 03:01:21.456]  I just don't know.
[03:01:21.456 --> 03:01:26.517]  Luke, what's your prediction for Hillary?
[03:01:26.517 --> 03:01:29.158]  Well, you see, she sold her soul.
[03:01:29.158 --> 03:01:30.398]  She's gone.
[03:01:30.398 --> 03:01:30.899]  Right?
[03:01:30.899 --> 03:01:32.799]  And she failed.
[03:01:32.799 --> 03:01:35.440]  And so now, they're gonna roll her out.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:40.761]  Oh no, you're not gonna just get to retire in your little home you bought with all the sell-out Chi-Com money.
[03:01:40.761 --> 03:01:43.082]  You're gonna roll out on your little wheelchair
[03:01:43.732 --> 03:01:48.316]  Well, there's a photo of her, you know, literally coming off of her black vehicle, her black ambulance with the wheelchair.
[03:01:48.316 --> 03:01:48.856]  I mean, it is a fact.
[03:02:11.789 --> 03:02:12.269]  That's right.
[03:02:12.269 --> 03:02:13.329]  Good to hear from you.
[03:02:13.329 --> 03:02:15.610]  And we got a ton of callers here that are awesome.
[03:02:15.610 --> 03:02:17.511]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:02:32.930 --> 03:02:35.372]  Let's talk to Paul in North Carolina.
[03:02:35.372 --> 03:02:36.813]  He says he's a combat vet.
[03:02:36.813 --> 03:02:38.854]  Don't wear red at the polls.
[03:02:38.854 --> 03:02:40.375]  Left will attack you.
[03:02:40.375 --> 03:02:41.056]  I have no doubt.
[03:02:41.056 --> 03:02:44.278]  But don't let them stop you from going to the polls.
[03:02:44.278 --> 03:02:46.660]  But absolutely, get in there and get it done.
[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:50.042]  What have you heard or what are you thinking, Paul?
[03:02:50.042 --> 03:02:50.863]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:50.863 --> 03:02:53.004]  I'm a longtime fan.
[03:02:53.004 --> 03:02:54.945]  I love all your products.
[03:02:54.945 --> 03:02:56.266]  Thank you.
[03:02:56.266 --> 03:02:59.489]  And I just love your toothpaste.
[03:02:59.489 --> 03:03:01.410]  The Super Silver.
[03:03:02.448 --> 03:03:08.951]  Um, Rainforest, X2, uh, I'm a repeat offender.
[03:03:08.951 --> 03:03:10.211]  If you want to look at it that way.
[03:03:10.211 --> 03:03:11.552]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:03:11.552 --> 03:03:14.393]  Without you, we wouldn't be here, and that's the truth.
[03:03:14.393 --> 03:03:15.073]  I love you.
[03:03:15.073 --> 03:03:15.974]  I love you.
[03:03:15.974 --> 03:03:18.015]  That's why some senior people thank me.
[03:03:18.015 --> 03:03:20.015]  Thank me?
[03:03:20.015 --> 03:03:21.616]  I'm as happy as a pig, and you know what?
[03:03:21.616 --> 03:03:22.316]  Fight the globalists.
[03:03:22.316 --> 03:03:24.237]  That's what we're supposed to do.
[03:03:24.237 --> 03:03:26.978]  We pray for you every single day in my house.
[03:03:26.978 --> 03:03:27.678]  Every single day.
[03:03:34.427 --> 03:03:47.458]  But what I'm thinking about is, I keep seeing on social media that there's this constant encouragement for people to wear red.
[03:03:47.458 --> 03:03:48.639]  Wear red.
[03:03:48.639 --> 03:03:49.640]  Wear red.
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:49.900]  Okay?
[03:03:50.726 --> 03:03:53.870]  And this is starting to trouble me a little bit.
[03:03:53.870 --> 03:03:54.190]  I get it.
[03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:57.934]  You're saying we're wearing a uniform and they're getting ready to launch an offensive.
[03:03:57.934 --> 03:04:01.318]  Why would you wear something identifying for them to kill you?
[03:04:01.318 --> 03:04:07.724]  Well, I mean, red is really easy to see in the peripheral, you know, with a scope.
[03:04:07.724 --> 03:04:12.790]  And I'm thinking about these idiot, moron, lunatic mental patients.
[03:04:13.779 --> 03:04:16.320]  Um, you know, because they already know that they're going to win.
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:16.640]  No, I agree.
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:24.062]  If they start a violent shooting war, you want to go wear an anti-fi outfit and get in the middle of them and, you know, bake them a cake.
[03:04:24.062 --> 03:04:36.725]  Well, I'm saying, like, at the voting, you know, where we're voting, you know, a large crowd of people wearing red, okay, is an easy target.
[03:04:36.725 --> 03:04:41.606]  I mean, and if they're up on a, you know, a rooftop or in a, you know,
[03:04:42.401 --> 03:04:46.282]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:04:59.545 --> 03:05:08.227]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:05:08.227 --> 03:05:10.208]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:05:10.208 --> 03:05:13.669]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:16.289]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:05:16.289 --> 03:05:17.850]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:05:18.570 --> 03:05:30.971]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:35.872]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:05:35.872 --> 03:05:37.053]  We'll win.
[03:05:37.053 --> 03:05:39.374]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:05:39.374 --> 03:05:47.098]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:05:47.098 --> 03:05:50.800]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[03:05:50.800 --> 03:05:52.361]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:05:52.361 --> 03:05:53.222]  We need your support.
[03:05:53.222 --> 03:05:53.762]  I'm counting on you.
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:10.123]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:06:10.123 --> 03:06:12.985]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:22.607 --> 03:06:32.370]  But the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots and tyrants, and I think you have to be as wise as a serpent, as peaceful as a dove, but walk softly and carry a big stick.
[03:06:32.370 --> 03:06:33.510]  Alex Jones, you're back live.
[03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:35.851]  Going right back to your phone calls.
[03:06:35.851 --> 03:06:36.831]  Really great calls today.
[03:06:42.529 --> 03:06:48.952]  If you're in red state areas, it's great to wear Trump hats and everything, to have solidarity, to promote free speech.
[03:06:48.952 --> 03:06:55.435]  And in targeted times, it only occurs like San Francisco or downtown Austin when you get yelled at or screamed at wearing one.
[03:06:55.435 --> 03:06:59.137]  And it's good to exercise it like Kanye's doing, just to promote free speech and say, I'm not a slave.
[03:06:59.137 --> 03:07:00.918]  I don't mean that because he's black.
[03:07:00.918 --> 03:07:03.719]  I mean, for all of us, we're not slaves to these people.
[03:07:03.719 --> 03:07:04.900]  Tell us what we can and can't say.
[03:07:04.900 --> 03:07:07.461]  That's so fundamental.
[03:07:07.461 --> 03:07:11.083]  It's their desperation that's made them show their true authoritarianism.
[03:07:13.029 --> 03:07:18.013]  But yeah, I think statistically you're not going to have an issue.
[03:07:18.013 --> 03:07:22.597]  But still, if you're the place where the Dems blow something up or shoot people, it won't matter, you'll be dead.
[03:07:25.905 --> 03:07:31.488]  There's no point in me, unless I'm videotaping it, to show how violent they are, to go out and look for trouble.
[03:07:31.488 --> 03:07:47.916]  So, sometimes I, even if I want to go out to eat with my kids or something, I'll wear like a cap or something, and in a big crowd of people, I won't even talk too much, because a lot of the time I've just got to get somewhere and fans will come over, and they're great, but I've got to get where I'm going, so I've got to shake everybody's hand, which I love doing, it's just that I've got to get somewhere.
[03:07:48.736 --> 03:07:52.661]  But yeah, I mean, I think everybody identifying wearing red is like a uniform.
[03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:54.984]  So it is very good to get the word out.
[03:07:54.984 --> 03:08:01.954]  But you have to know that when you're doing that, you're doing it for a specific reason, especially if it says Trump Pants 2020.
[03:08:01.954 --> 03:08:03.415]  We sell those shirts.
[03:08:03.415 --> 03:08:04.977]  It's like choose your own adventure.
[03:08:04.977 --> 03:08:06.419]  Wear a Molon Labe shirt.
[03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:09.881]  That the Antifa meth heads aren't going to know what that means.
[03:08:09.881 --> 03:08:11.282]  They're just getting a paycheck from Soros.
[03:08:11.282 --> 03:08:14.343]  But they will know what a Make America Great Again is.
[03:08:14.343 --> 03:08:16.544]  And they have no real power themselves.
[03:08:16.544 --> 03:08:17.204]  So they're cowards.
[03:08:17.204 --> 03:08:23.687]  You'll be sitting there at a cafe when they hit you in the back of the head with a bike lock or a chair and then run off.
[03:08:23.687 --> 03:08:28.289]  And so, yeah, I would not turn my back and I would not be in a wreck.
[03:08:28.289 --> 03:08:29.710]  I would not take my children out.
[03:08:30.350 --> 03:08:34.892]  Well, what I was thinking is, when we go to the voting, it doesn't matter where you are to go vote, to be invisible.
[03:09:00.051 --> 03:09:01.232]  Okay.
[03:09:01.232 --> 03:09:03.274]  Vote red to be invisible.
[03:09:03.274 --> 03:09:04.975]  All right.
[03:09:04.975 --> 03:09:12.042]  Because I think that these, they know that they're going to get the butt kick.
[03:09:12.042 --> 03:09:13.023]  I believe that.
[03:09:13.023 --> 03:09:15.845]  That they know that they're going to get the butt kick.
[03:09:15.845 --> 03:09:17.507]  And so what are they going to do?
[03:09:17.507 --> 03:09:19.408]  You're always asking that, Alex.
[03:09:19.408 --> 03:09:21.510]  What are they going to do next?
[03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:22.251]  Okay.
[03:09:22.251 --> 03:09:23.372]  And I'm thinking of basically
[03:09:24.056 --> 03:09:28.798]  A whole bunch of people that are proud, and I can understand pride.
[03:09:28.798 --> 03:09:32.779]  You know, I'm not... You're saying it might trigger them like anybody trying to have a Trump demonstration.
[03:09:32.779 --> 03:09:35.420]  In America, Antifa shows up.
[03:09:35.420 --> 03:09:40.902]  Well, not everywhere now, because I heard some of them fell down and hit their heads, but... Wow, imagine that!
[03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:43.123]  But you also know there's other forces involved here.
[03:09:43.123 --> 03:09:49.505]  You know, Antifa is... a little bird told me, is getting followed back to their houses when they beat up women and children now.
[03:09:49.505 --> 03:09:52.966]  I heard like a week or two later, they fall down the stairs, Paul.
[03:09:57.213 --> 03:10:02.516]  Yeah, and a bunch of witnesses see it and, uh, yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:10:02.516 --> 03:10:04.237]  You just fell down the steps.
[03:10:04.237 --> 03:10:05.898]  I know all about that.
[03:10:05.898 --> 03:10:09.159]  But you're the one that keeps asking this, Alex.
[03:10:09.159 --> 03:10:11.400]  You know, what are they going to do next?
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:21.726]  And I'm thinking that if a lot of people that are proud of, you know, who they're voting for and what side they're on and everything like that, I can understand the pride, right?
[03:10:22.519 --> 03:10:27.381]  If they're in a big crowd like that, there's some mental patient on the left.
[03:10:27.381 --> 03:10:28.622]  Oh, I totally agree!
[03:10:28.622 --> 03:10:35.185]  You heard about this leftist who confessed to the 200 pound bomb that was gonna blow up the mall, right?
[03:10:35.185 --> 03:10:39.467]  Or just like Las Vegas, the Las Vegas shooting.
[03:10:39.467 --> 03:10:39.807]  Okay?
[03:10:39.807 --> 03:10:45.169]  I mean, how far away was that shooter from that crowd of people?
[03:10:45.169 --> 03:10:46.650]  Right?
[03:10:46.650 --> 03:10:49.151]  And just imagine like a bunch of people dressed in red.
[03:10:49.568 --> 03:10:50.648]  Paul, great point.
[03:10:50.648 --> 03:10:51.549]  People should think about it.
[03:10:51.549 --> 03:10:53.529]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:53.529 --> 03:10:55.150]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.910]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:58.691]  Thanks for holding.
[03:10:58.691 --> 03:11:00.692]  Hey, Alex.
[03:11:00.692 --> 03:11:06.954]  I would like to say, you know, degenerate, psychopathic, scrupulous, control freak.
[03:11:06.954 --> 03:11:10.695]  It's a good way to describe these people.
[03:11:10.695 --> 03:11:16.437]  You know, I remember back when you sat in front of a curtain with headphones on your head.
[03:11:16.437 --> 03:11:17.798]  I remember back when you predicted 9-11.
[03:11:18.826 --> 03:11:24.830]  I've been around listening to you that long, and you asked earlier, you know, 10 segments of Dorsey's.
[03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:25.911]  Great.
[03:11:25.911 --> 03:11:30.635]  And man, I mean, you remember because you were a day member.
[03:11:30.635 --> 03:11:36.059]  I cannot believe how far we we couldn't exaggerate.
[03:11:36.059 --> 03:11:38.440]  You wouldn't even have exaggerated this far then.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:39.761]  It's crazy.
[03:11:39.761 --> 03:11:43.424]  I urge everybody who's listening right now, don't just listen to Alex.
[03:11:44.096 --> 03:11:51.679]  Go on YouTube and watch Kanye talk in the Oval Office yesterday, because it really had a big impact on me.
[03:11:51.679 --> 03:11:56.140]  I was supporting him already, but man, you gotta hear him, and you're gonna understand.
[03:11:56.140 --> 03:12:00.182]  I wanted to touch on that one more thing I wanted to ask Alex.
[03:12:01.207 --> 03:12:06.750]  Um, brother, is, uh, I have been searching around and I've heard you touch on it, but you didn't get into it too much.
[03:12:06.750 --> 03:12:10.251]  You talked about how you're going to, you're getting out of the iPhone.
[03:12:10.251 --> 03:12:11.392]  You're going back to PCs.
[03:12:11.392 --> 03:12:12.833]  I did the same thing years ago.
[03:12:12.833 --> 03:12:24.118]  I went to Mac just because of the program, the infrastructure, it made sense, you know, but I'm on a, my, uh, Tricom spy device right now talking to you and I want out.
[03:12:24.118 --> 03:12:27.980]  And I, I would like to put together some kind of a,
[03:12:31.311 --> 03:12:37.274]  Well, no, I agree.
[03:12:37.274 --> 03:12:45.698]  We should look at companies that have smartphones, that aren't owned by the evil Chinese communists, that aren't putting spy chips on them, and they're all platforms of Trojan horses.
[03:12:45.698 --> 03:12:47.699]  It's just Apple's the worst.
[03:12:47.699 --> 03:12:47.999]  Bye!
[03:12:49.281 --> 03:12:50.562]  Leagues by light years.
[03:12:50.562 --> 03:13:00.490]  I mean, they are consciously calling for censorship, waging war against America, putting spy ships in, Chinese government run, giving the iCloud keys to the government.
[03:13:00.490 --> 03:13:02.992]  And but it's OK, because, you know, Tim Cook, Francis Rundling.
[03:13:02.992 --> 03:13:05.474]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[03:13:05.474 --> 03:13:07.156]  And so, yeah, no, I don't know the answer.
[03:13:08.027 --> 03:13:08.787]  I don't know the answer.
[03:13:08.787 --> 03:13:09.848]  I was always a PC guy.
[03:13:09.848 --> 03:13:16.170]  Then like 19 years ago, we moved over to Mac because they had good, cheaper video editing processing.
[03:13:16.170 --> 03:13:21.132]  And then, you know, there were more bugs in PC, so I kind of liked the Mac level at that point.
[03:13:21.132 --> 03:13:23.973]  But this is not the company Steve Jobs started.
[03:13:23.973 --> 03:13:25.674]  Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have iPads.
[03:13:25.674 --> 03:13:26.975]  Now everybody's got them.
[03:13:26.975 --> 03:13:27.975]  And so you're absolutely right.
[03:13:27.975 --> 03:13:28.675]  God bless you, Mike.
[03:13:28.675 --> 03:13:29.816]  Good to hear from you.
[03:13:29.816 --> 03:13:30.196]  Yeah, I know.
[03:13:30.196 --> 03:13:30.776]  It's here.
[03:13:30.776 --> 03:13:32.617]  It's going on.
[03:13:32.617 --> 03:13:34.037]  Let's go ahead and get another caller in here.
[03:13:34.037 --> 03:13:34.658]  Let's talk to...
[03:13:39.178 --> 03:13:41.459]  Talk to Jason in New Mexico.
[03:13:41.459 --> 03:13:44.240]  Let's talk Trump, Kanye meeting, and Larry Hoover.
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:45.501]  Go ahead.
[03:13:45.501 --> 03:13:47.482]  Thank you very much for taking my call, sir.
[03:13:47.482 --> 03:13:49.182]  I'm going to get right to it.
[03:13:49.182 --> 03:13:51.884]  Kanye tipped the scale by mentioning Larry Hoover.
[03:13:51.884 --> 03:13:55.825]  And the thing that the Democrats hate the most is an empowered black man.
[03:13:55.825 --> 03:14:03.409]  And you can look at the history and look at Malcolm X. He didn't get killed until he started going against the Democratic Party and started speaking to black people about waking up.
[03:14:03.409 --> 03:14:06.190]  Yeah, he said the Democratic Party's worse and they're the ones of slavery.
[03:14:06.670 --> 03:14:11.315]  He said the Republicans aren't perfect, but listen, the Democrats are the ones that are domesticating you to control you.
[03:14:11.315 --> 03:14:15.980]  And then when he stopped doing the whole race thing where all whites are evil, that's when they killed him.
[03:14:17.268 --> 03:14:18.048]  Exactly.
[03:14:18.048 --> 03:14:19.849]  And so the same deal with Larry Hoover.
[03:14:19.849 --> 03:14:36.413]  When Kanye mentioned Larry Hoover, which is the founder of the Black Gangster Disciples, but he changed his life and started the growth and development curriculum, this basically would overnight instantly gain that urban support if Trump was to pardon him or commence his sentence.
[03:14:36.413 --> 03:14:41.674]  Because what Larry Hoover was doing was actually starting to reform and reshape Chicago.
[03:14:41.674 --> 03:14:43.855]  And if you look at the state of what Chicago is in now,
[03:14:44.275 --> 03:15:00.181]  They couldn't have him get political and they only gave him the six life sentences because I believe he started to get political, empower his community, let them know that we need to have the factories, the jobs, everything that would empower young men to stay in the houses, everything that Kanye said.
[03:15:00.421 --> 03:15:00.621]  Okay.
[03:15:16.784 --> 03:15:22.811]  Oh, you're right, and the Democratic Party thinks they own everybody, but they really get territorial about black people and black men.
[03:15:22.811 --> 03:15:28.398]  Like Hillary's saying, black men are predators, and we need to keep them to heal like a dog.
[03:15:28.398 --> 03:15:29.739]  God bless you, Jason.
[03:15:29.739 --> 03:15:30.860]  There's an awakening worldwide.
[03:15:30.860 --> 03:15:31.521]  It's huge.
[03:15:31.521 --> 03:15:34.825]  I'm sorry to all the other callers, but we got these clips coming up from last night that were powerful.
[03:15:36.607 --> 03:15:37.708]  So that's going to happen.
[03:15:37.708 --> 03:15:39.289]  And then the war room's coming up.
[03:15:39.289 --> 03:15:40.770]  Thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[03:15:40.770 --> 03:15:41.751]  I'm humbled.

[03:17:22.623 --> 03:17:23.844]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:23.844 --> 03:17:27.767]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.767 --> 03:17:29.308]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.308 --> 03:17:32.270]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.270 --> 03:17:37.833]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.833 --> 03:17:39.034]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.034 --> 03:17:41.976]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:41.976 --> 03:17:44.198]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.198 --> 03:17:48.641]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:48.641 --> 03:17:50.922]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:54.249 --> 03:17:58.194]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.194 --> 03:18:01.499]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.499 --> 03:18:07.767]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.767 --> 03:18:10.531]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.272 --> 03:18:15.075]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.075 --> 03:18:21.560]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:26.525]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.265 --> 03:18:31.187]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.187 --> 03:18:38.391]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.391 --> 03:18:43.053]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.053 --> 03:18:49.297]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.297 --> 03:18:53.279]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.199 --> 03:19:02.587]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.587 --> 03:19:04.069]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.069 --> 03:19:08.773]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.773 --> 03:19:11.856]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.316 --> 03:19:13.997]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:13.997 --> 03:19:34.151]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.651 --> 03:19:38.654]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it is gone.
[03:19:38.654 --> 03:19:42.317]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:19:42.317 --> 03:19:47.321]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:19:47.321 --> 03:19:50.063]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:19:50.063 --> 03:19:57.208]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.208 --> 03:19:59.850]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.935 --> 03:20:24.703]  Caitlin, I mean you were there breathing this guy's nauseous breath right in your face.
[03:20:24.703 --> 03:20:29.170]  I commend you and he's grabbing you for not smacking him upside the head.
[03:20:29.170 --> 03:20:29.891]  This is incredible.
[03:20:30.953 --> 03:20:36.917]  Well, if anyone knows anything about me, it's that I carry a firearm everywhere I go.
[03:20:36.917 --> 03:20:42.321]  And I don't think that man, because he's so old and crazy, even knew about me.
[03:20:42.321 --> 03:20:44.702]  But there were other women there who did.
[03:20:44.702 --> 03:20:47.224]  One actually got in my face and said she was going to punch me.
[03:20:47.224 --> 03:20:50.206]  And I just kindly and calmly reminded her.
[03:20:50.826 --> 03:20:56.791]  Who I am and that I do carry a firearm and boy does she turn around after that.
[03:20:56.791 --> 03:21:01.916]  So, you know, they should be out there talking about women's right to self-defense.
[03:21:01.916 --> 03:21:10.163]  If anything, they want to call themselves feminists, but instead they, you know, prop up people who want to threaten conservatives and
[03:21:11.112 --> 03:21:11.712]  I just don't know.
[03:21:11.712 --> 03:21:14.593]  Well, we commend you, but I've got to ask you this question.
[03:21:14.593 --> 03:21:18.074]  You've traveled all the country now, like Millie Weaver and other great reporters have.
[03:21:18.074 --> 03:21:19.275]  We don't have to cherry pick.
[03:21:19.275 --> 03:21:25.077]  Owen would do like three, four hour long, still does, Facebooks and YouTubes, and they get millions of views.
[03:21:25.077 --> 03:21:29.498]  And it's like one person after the next act like gibbering mental patients.
[03:21:29.498 --> 03:21:33.519]  And we're not like feeling powerful that they released the state hospital.
[03:21:33.519 --> 03:21:35.020]  But I mean, you go to a Democrat event.
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:44.384]  They, I don't care what color they are, they look like they got beat with a mentally ill stick and they're just drooling.
[03:21:44.384 --> 03:21:45.184]  They're racist.
[03:21:45.184 --> 03:21:54.028]  You'll see white people call black cops the n-word and then the media, I mean, it's like a license to act like animals.
[03:21:54.028 --> 03:21:54.849]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:21:56.789 --> 03:22:03.651]  Well, it is mentally ill people, and there's a lot of reasons how they've reached that point.
[03:22:03.651 --> 03:22:09.993]  But they've now been hit with the messaging and hit with the propaganda at the right time to activate them.
[03:22:09.993 --> 03:22:11.333]  And it's all about justification.
[03:22:11.333 --> 03:22:12.914]  I mean, Alex, let's be real.
[03:22:12.914 --> 03:22:23.217]  If you really believed there was a Nazi KKK member as the United States President, if you really believed there was a serial gang rapist on the Supreme Court,
[03:22:23.817 --> 03:22:26.881]  Maybe you do have a little justification to want to do something.
[03:22:26.881 --> 03:22:28.323]  But that's not even true!
[03:22:28.323 --> 03:22:29.364]  It's beyond that.
[03:22:29.364 --> 03:22:32.047]  It's like... It's the justification.
[03:22:32.047 --> 03:22:33.910]  They're being screwed by the globalists.
[03:22:33.910 --> 03:22:37.654]  But they're in love with running around and freaking out.
[03:22:37.654 --> 03:22:39.196]  And they're all... Here's what it is.
[03:22:40.302 --> 03:22:41.743]  That guy's obviously on oxygen.
[03:22:41.743 --> 03:22:43.184]  A lot of people are.
[03:22:43.184 --> 03:22:44.646]  He's on disability.
[03:22:44.646 --> 03:22:45.767]  They're all on welfare.
[03:22:45.767 --> 03:22:49.210]  It's what Mitt Romney said was true.
[03:22:49.210 --> 03:22:50.751]  47.9% don't work.
[03:22:50.751 --> 03:22:51.652]  They're being manipulated.
[03:22:51.652 --> 03:22:53.854]  A big, rich, free market could take care of them.
[03:22:53.854 --> 03:22:55.995]  But like Venezuela, no one gets any welfare now.
[03:22:56.696 --> 03:22:57.617]  But they don't get that.
[03:22:57.617 --> 03:23:03.022]  So the truth is, they're just pissed and think the workers aren't going to give them free stuff.
[03:23:03.022 --> 03:23:08.367]  So they're just out there to intimidate you and say, I'm going to rape your ass, woman, if you don't give me my goddamn money.
[03:23:08.367 --> 03:23:10.650]  Excuse me for saying that, but go ahead, Kaitlin Bennett.
[03:23:11.874 --> 03:23:19.041]  So, Owen, you guys were talking about them being mentally ill and they look like they just came out of a mental health facility.
[03:23:19.041 --> 03:23:26.268]  I actually talked to one woman who held up a sign that said the GOP hates women and I just asked a very objective question.
[03:23:26.268 --> 03:23:32.535]  I said, what do you think about the women who do vote for Trump and who do align with the right-wing ideology?
[03:23:33.035 --> 03:23:47.625]  And she said that she feels the only reason women ever align to the right wing is because they have experienced trauma in their life that has left them with PTSD and some type of mental health defect.
[03:23:47.625 --> 03:23:51.647]  And I'll release that video as soon as it's edited and we find it.
[03:23:51.647 --> 03:23:55.890]  It is literally the holy team of men and women together that build the world.
[03:23:55.890 --> 03:23:58.071]  That men and women together is the power.
[03:23:58.071 --> 03:23:58.412]  Go ahead.
[03:23:58.412 --> 03:23:58.892]  Talk about that.
[03:24:01.638 --> 03:24:04.740]  Yeah, I mean, we have women's marches.
[03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:05.661]  We can see it right now.
[03:24:05.661 --> 03:24:09.584]  Women's marches are going around and they just chant at everything.
[03:24:09.584 --> 03:24:13.687]  They can't come together and actually build something.
[03:24:13.687 --> 03:24:16.489]  All they do is brainwash people.
[03:24:16.489 --> 03:24:27.637]  But men and women coming together, we have those family values, the traditional values that sustain a family and have the working class and everything.
[03:24:27.637 --> 03:24:28.078]  And it's just
[03:24:29.296 --> 03:24:31.658]  Well, of course the globalists want to get in the middle of men and women.
[03:24:31.658 --> 03:24:32.739]  That's the species!
[03:24:32.739 --> 03:24:36.102]  That's the power!
[03:24:36.102 --> 03:24:37.183]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:24:37.183 --> 03:24:42.268]  I mean, I'm happy with- Well, tell us about your political process.
[03:24:42.268 --> 03:24:42.648]  Get into it.
[03:24:42.648 --> 03:24:43.289]  You never do this on air.
[03:24:43.289 --> 03:24:49.634]  Get into your family, your process, where you grew up, what got you politically involved with hundreds of millions of views now, just the last six months.
[03:24:49.634 --> 03:24:53.137]  I mean, you've exploded out there, and you're an example to other women and men.
[03:24:53.137 --> 03:24:54.418]  Tell us about yourself.
[03:24:56.172 --> 03:25:04.163]  So, in high school, I started to kind of understand more of the political ideology that was around me.
[03:25:04.163 --> 03:25:08.810]  I had an English teacher who was so left-wing.
[03:25:08.810 --> 03:25:11.233]  She had a Hillary Clinton bobblehead on her desk.
[03:25:12.234 --> 03:25:17.737]  I just kind of was like, would it be okay if someone had like a Reagan bobblehead on their desk?
[03:25:17.737 --> 03:25:25.821]  And she tried to push a lot of her socialist ideology onto the class and I would always be that person that would say no.
[03:25:25.821 --> 03:25:33.924]  I actually wrote a paper against teacher unions to her and when I turned it in I said, please don't grade it badly just because I disagree with you.
[03:25:33.924 --> 03:25:39.447]  She ended up being one of the best teachers I had and she helped me more understand my viewpoint because
[03:25:40.168 --> 03:25:43.375]  I could disagree with her and I could listen to the other side.
[03:25:43.375 --> 03:25:43.896]  I had to.
[03:25:43.896 --> 03:25:45.580]  She was in my class.
[03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:49.149]  But going through college, when I went to Kent State,
[03:25:49.537 --> 03:25:52.958]  That was the first time I really experienced the indoctrination.
[03:25:52.958 --> 03:26:04.963]  It wasn't really bad in high school, but when I got here, one of the first things I witnessed was a Black Lives Matter protest on campus trying to shut down the Black Squirrel Festival that Kent has every year.
[03:26:04.963 --> 03:26:07.264]  And I was just, I was freaking out.
[03:26:07.264 --> 03:26:09.525]  I was like, oh my gosh, this is a culture shock.
[03:26:09.525 --> 03:26:13.747]  Like, I live in the middle of nowhere in Zanesville, and I see this stuff.
[03:26:15.210 --> 03:26:20.208]  And like your Skype's breaking up, but they're like saying that a black saying black squirrel is racist?
[03:26:23.104 --> 03:26:25.384]  No, they just wanted to shut it down.
[03:26:25.384 --> 03:26:26.845]  They wanted to block everybody.
[03:26:26.845 --> 03:26:33.786]  I saw the university that said that it was Lynch Hall, which is an Irish name, but Lynch could be associated with lynching someone.
[03:26:33.786 --> 03:26:38.347]  So they changed the name because the word Lynch was scary.
[03:26:38.347 --> 03:26:39.227]  Same thing with me.
[03:26:39.227 --> 03:26:40.767]  I witnessed going to college a few years.
[03:26:40.767 --> 03:26:42.387]  It was all worthless disinfo.
[03:26:42.387 --> 03:26:45.008]  I already had a sales job, was successful.
[03:26:45.008 --> 03:26:48.989]  And all it was was America bashing, no matter what the class was.
[03:26:48.989 --> 03:26:50.849]  And I was like, God, this is authoritarianism.
[03:26:52.819 --> 03:26:54.120]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:27:07.554]  When I was in my architecture class, he was going on about how women should be pro-abortion and pro-choice, and he was going on about how gay he was, and I'm like, dude, no one cares that you're gay, but we want to learn about the Taj Mahal so we can pass our exams.
[03:27:07.554 --> 03:27:09.737]  Yeah, why is a gay dude like, kill your baby?
[03:27:09.737 --> 03:27:11.659]  It's really sexy, because David Rockefeller said so.
[03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:18.486]  So after I dealt with that, I realized there were no conservatives on campus standing up for themselves.
[03:27:18.486 --> 03:27:21.529]  So I just said, OK, I'll be that person then.
[03:27:21.529 --> 03:27:23.712]  And I was so shy.
[03:27:23.712 --> 03:27:29.118]  I did not like putting myself out there, but I just got so sick of seeing
[03:27:29.498 --> 03:27:39.020]  All of this indoctrination happening on campuses and I could not freely express my opinion without someone in my class just talking down to me or even the professors.
[03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:56.203]  So the very first thing I did was take a Trump flag out to one of the very many protests that the leftists on Kent State campus did and I just stood there and I stated my voice and I marched with them around campus and then I ended up in student conduct because they wanted to
[03:27:57.203 --> 03:28:02.530]  Expel me for my Trump flag and that made me mad.
[03:28:02.530 --> 03:28:04.132]  Caitlin Bennett, you are amazing.
[03:28:04.132 --> 03:28:05.114]  God bless you.
[03:28:05.114 --> 03:28:06.716]  We really, really appreciate you.
[03:28:06.716 --> 03:28:11.041]  The articles on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com, LibertyHangout.org.
[03:28:11.041 --> 03:28:12.023]  Thanks for joining us tonight.
[03:28:13.937 --> 03:28:17.720]  You know, it's great to have new young firebrands.
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:18.700]  It makes me excited.
[03:28:18.700 --> 03:28:19.921]  Like Caitlyn Bennett coming up.
[03:28:19.921 --> 03:28:21.522]  And you know what the crazy thing, Alex?
[03:28:21.522 --> 03:28:27.346]  Someone like me, and I think Caitlyn is the same way, when I was in college I wasn't necessarily politically inclined.
[03:28:27.346 --> 03:28:32.809]  But then once you get politically inclined and you just have conservative values, you don't think like, oh, this means I'm going to get death threats.
[03:28:32.809 --> 03:28:33.910]  Oh, people are going to hate me now.
[03:28:33.910 --> 03:28:37.112]  And then you do it and you get it and it's just like, whoa.
[03:28:37.112 --> 03:28:40.314]  But then you know you've got to do it more because they're lying and stealing your identity.
[03:28:40.314 --> 03:28:41.335]  Well, that's how I am.
[03:28:41.335 --> 03:28:42.475]  That just made me fight harder.
[03:28:44.265 --> 03:28:45.480]  We're good to go.
[03:28:53.129 --> 03:28:56.590]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:59.410]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.410 --> 03:29:01.310]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.

[03:32:56.697 --> 03:32:59.338]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.916 --> 03:33:23.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:28.543]  Okay, so let's go to the CNN edited piece where it makes no sense.
[03:33:28.543 --> 03:33:38.049]  They put a similar clip out nationwide of literally from like 10 minutes of the thing, mixing things together to make Kanye sound crazy, and then we're gonna roll what he actually said.
[03:33:38.049 --> 03:33:39.590]  So let's roll the edited piece.
[03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:45.312]  I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life.
[03:33:45.312 --> 03:33:49.353]  You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends.
[03:33:49.353 --> 03:33:53.275]  But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power in a way.
[03:33:53.275 --> 03:34:00.757]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[03:34:00.757 --> 03:34:05.039]  And also, I'm married to a family that, you know,
[03:34:06.279 --> 03:34:08.240]  Not a lot of male energy going on.
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:09.721]  It's beautiful, though.
[03:34:09.721 --> 03:34:14.763]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary.
[03:34:14.763 --> 03:34:16.343]  I love everyone, right?
[03:34:16.343 --> 03:34:26.568]  But the campaign, I'm with her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son.
[03:34:26.568 --> 03:34:30.850]  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[03:34:30.850 --> 03:34:32.210]  You made a Superman.
[03:34:32.210 --> 03:34:33.531]  That's my favorite superhero.
[03:34:36.167 --> 03:34:52.877]  So they edited it all together so you don't quite get what he's saying, but now he's going to really get to what's being talked about here, about how they want to take chiefs, they want to take role models away from men and women, because they know women, once men are gone, will comply and become
[03:34:53.863 --> 03:34:54.884]  I don't know.
[03:35:10.908 --> 03:35:13.451]  Mrs. Johnson, they got her out.
[03:35:13.451 --> 03:35:15.954]  She was very unfairly treated.
[03:35:15.954 --> 03:35:17.556]  And there are many other people like that.
[03:35:29.642 --> 03:35:38.485]  By the way, everything Trump is doing is about taking people that are nonviolent, whether it be white or black, get them out of prison.
[03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.830]  How old is he?
[03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:53.030]  How old?
[03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.090]  68.
[03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.771]  He's 68 years old?
[03:36:13.763 --> 03:36:20.567]  No, really the reason why they imprinted him is because he started doing positive for the community.
[03:36:20.567 --> 03:36:26.650]  He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around.
[03:36:26.650 --> 03:36:31.252]  So there's theories that there's infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate universes.
[03:36:31.252 --> 03:36:32.533]  See, they fear you.
[03:36:32.533 --> 03:36:33.573]  He controls the universe.
[03:36:33.573 --> 03:36:34.674]  He's Tim, the highest level.
[03:36:37.555 --> 03:36:44.100]  Each shows the universe, they want you to go with what they're saying instead of getting your own individual free will.
[03:36:44.100 --> 03:36:46.261]  He's literally giving you the key.
[03:36:46.261 --> 03:36:54.227]  What Kanye just said is- This entertainer having a monolithic voice that's forced to be- Monolithic, keep it going.
[03:36:54.227 --> 03:36:57.049]  People expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat.
[03:36:57.669 --> 03:37:05.456]  I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat.
[03:37:05.456 --> 03:37:10.461]  They say, you know, first of all, it's a limit to the amount of jobs.
[03:37:10.461 --> 03:37:17.127]  So the fathers lose the jobs and they say, we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home.
[03:37:17.127 --> 03:37:22.092]  And then we got rid of the mental health institution in the 80s and the 90s and the prison rate.
[03:37:22.572 --> 03:37:28.959]  Just shot her, and now you have Chirac, what people call Chirac, which is actually a murder rate that's going down by 20%.
[03:37:28.959 --> 03:37:31.863]  What is so common sense you wonder if people can even comprehend it.
[03:37:37.509 --> 03:37:43.171]  The reason why we need 3 million people on welfare is because we don't have 3 million jobs because we shipped them to China.
[03:37:43.171 --> 03:37:46.092]  You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends.
[03:37:46.092 --> 03:37:50.013]  But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power in a way.
[03:37:50.013 --> 03:37:57.475]  You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home.
[03:37:57.475 --> 03:38:01.777]  And also, uh, a marriage with family that, um, pre-kiddo.
[03:38:03.017 --> 03:38:06.458]  Not a lot of male energy going on, it's beautiful though.
[03:38:06.458 --> 03:38:13.080]  But there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary, I love everyone, right?
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:23.302]  But the campaign, I'm with her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his tongue.
[03:38:23.302 --> 03:38:27.223]  It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman.
[03:38:27.523 --> 03:38:37.911]  You made a Superman, that's my favorite superhero, and you made a Superman cape for me also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys.
[03:38:37.911 --> 03:38:45.897]  Non-political, no bullsh**, put the beep on it however you want to do it, 5 seconds delay, and just goes in and gets it done.
[03:38:45.897 --> 03:38:51.381]  Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas because at Adidas, I went in in 2015 with $14 million dollars.
[03:38:53.863 --> 03:38:54.184]  He's dumb!
[03:38:54.184 --> 03:38:54.544]  You're dumb!
[03:38:54.544 --> 03:38:56.607]  He's talking fast because he's smart!
[03:38:56.607 --> 03:38:58.229]  You didn't make $5 billion, you're-
[03:39:10.946 --> 03:39:14.588]  Onshore, not even shore, into the core.
[03:39:14.588 --> 03:39:17.270]  It's not about the borders, the core of Adidas.
[03:39:17.270 --> 03:39:20.192]  And Chicago is the core of middle America.
[03:39:20.192 --> 03:39:22.233]  We have to make middle America strong.
[03:39:22.233 --> 03:39:26.315]  So I had the balls, because I had enough balls.
[03:39:26.315 --> 03:39:28.637]  I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire.
[03:39:28.637 --> 03:39:32.639]  And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal.
[03:39:32.639 --> 03:39:33.500]  But even with that,
[03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:40.804]  I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no home.
[03:39:40.804 --> 03:39:44.666]  And when we do have prison recreation, for no- That's Superman.
[03:39:44.666 --> 03:39:50.689]  And he realizes that there's only one man who can help him make that happen, and that's President Donald Trump.
[03:39:50.689 --> 03:39:58.673]  And he's saying, empower my people, get them out of prison, build factories in the black community, help stop this garbage, and they say he's a dumb Negro!
[03:39:58.933 --> 03:40:02.854]  Because they want to keep everybody poor on that damn plantation.
[03:40:19.019 --> 03:40:21.081]  The media claims Trump was speechless it was so dumb.
[03:40:21.081 --> 03:40:22.662]  Just by the way, never freed the blacks.
[03:40:37.495 --> 03:40:41.219]  The Constitution is the face of our industry, right?
[03:40:41.219 --> 03:40:43.441]  Of our country, of our company.
[03:40:43.441 --> 03:40:51.069]  Would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up- If you're black, you get three times longer in prison.
[03:40:51.069 --> 03:40:51.669]  I don't support that.
[03:40:51.669 --> 03:40:53.731]  You got to remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship.
[03:40:53.731 --> 03:40:54.612]  That's a Democrat policy.
[03:40:54.612 --> 03:40:59.357]  The four gentlemen that wrote the- Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton wrote the legislation.
[03:41:00.578 --> 03:41:02.901]  We don't have 13 floors, do we?
[03:41:02.901 --> 03:41:09.127]  So the four gentlemen that wrote the amendment didn't look like the people they were amending.
[03:41:09.127 --> 03:41:16.515]  Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans to read,
[03:41:18.677 --> 03:41:20.858]  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
[03:41:20.858 --> 03:41:25.940]  I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL.
[03:41:25.940 --> 03:41:27.540]  And he looked at my brain.
[03:41:27.540 --> 03:41:29.021]  It's equal on three parts.
[03:41:42.506 --> 03:41:45.289]  I'm going to go ahead and drop some bombs for you.
[03:41:45.289 --> 03:41:47.270]  98 percentile IQ test.
[03:41:47.270 --> 03:41:54.396]  I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards off the repeat, so I'm going to work on that one.
[03:41:54.396 --> 03:41:55.958]  The other ones, 98 percent.
[03:41:55.958 --> 03:41:57.159]  Tesla, Freud.
[03:41:57.159 --> 03:42:01.723]  You know, so... Yeah, Kanye West is a genius.
[03:42:01.723 --> 03:42:04.725]  And the blacks are calling him a retard because he's a genius.
[03:42:04.725 --> 03:42:07.127]  I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia.
[03:42:07.127 --> 03:42:08.568]  No, get on the plantation, Kanye.
[03:42:09.529 --> 03:42:10.851]  Put your shackles on, Kanye.
[03:42:10.851 --> 03:42:15.196]  He's exhausted, he's supporting Trump, and grab him and throw him on that list.
[03:42:15.196 --> 03:42:16.517]  All these parasites that live off him.
[03:42:16.517 --> 03:42:17.198]  They all live off him.
[03:42:29.912 --> 03:42:31.573]  So we can empower pharmaceuticals?
[03:42:31.573 --> 03:42:32.333]  Exactly!
[03:42:32.333 --> 03:42:33.673]  He's saying, listen, I'm the leader!
[03:42:33.673 --> 03:42:34.614]  I build it!
[03:42:34.614 --> 03:42:35.334]  I build it!
[03:42:35.334 --> 03:42:35.654]  I build it!
[03:42:35.654 --> 03:42:36.614]  I'm the free, the trustee!
[03:42:36.614 --> 03:42:38.175]  I'm building it, bitch!
[03:42:38.175 --> 03:42:39.135]  We've got Foxconn!
[03:42:39.135 --> 03:42:40.535]  This is what it sounds like!
[03:42:40.535 --> 03:42:42.936]  No, bring them here and make them good!
[03:42:42.936 --> 03:42:43.496]  It's at $1,000 in China.
[03:42:43.496 --> 03:42:44.397]  He's getting them at our level.
[03:42:44.397 --> 03:42:48.118]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.522 --> 03:43:07.205]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:07.205 --> 03:43:09.166]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.166 --> 03:43:12.627]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.627 --> 03:43:15.248]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.248 --> 03:43:17.548]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.548 --> 03:43:24.491]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:43:25.031 --> 03:43:34.839]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.839 --> 03:43:36.020]  We'll win.
[03:43:36.020 --> 03:43:38.922]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[03:43:38.922 --> 03:43:46.088]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:43:46.088 --> 03:43:49.771]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:43:49.771 --> 03:43:51.332]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:43:51.332 --> 03:43:52.213]  We need your support.
[03:43:52.213 --> 03:43:52.733]  I'm counting on you.
[03:43:53.024 --> 03:43:55.725]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[03:43:55.725 --> 03:44:02.067]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[03:44:02.067 --> 03:44:04.048]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:44:54.062 --> 03:45:02.448]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.448 --> 03:45:03.909]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.909 --> 03:45:08.612]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.612 --> 03:45:13.595]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.855 --> 03:45:34.018]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:45:57.899 --> 03:46:03.623]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.623 --> 03:46:11.488]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:46:11.488 --> 03:46:14.650]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:46:14.830 --> 03:46:20.117]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:46:20.117 --> 03:46:22.901]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:22.901 --> 03:46:31.894]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:46:32.034 --> 03:46:43.876]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[03:46:43.876 --> 03:46:48.698]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:48.698 --> 03:46:57.619]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:57.619 --> 03:47:00.260]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.989 --> 03:47:18.352]  If he don't look good, we don't look good.
[03:47:18.352 --> 03:47:20.093]  This is our president.
[03:47:20.093 --> 03:47:25.218]  He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories.
[03:47:25.218 --> 03:47:29.841]  And the guy that wanted to blow up the wall, he said, I don't like the renaissance.
[03:47:29.841 --> 03:47:30.602]  They don't like this.
[03:47:30.602 --> 03:47:32.724]  Do you think they like seeing this right here?
[03:47:32.724 --> 03:47:34.505]  All I do is feel good seeing this.
[03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:41.190]  If he doesn't look good, we don't look good.
[03:48:06.499 --> 03:48:07.300]  That's great, right?
[03:48:07.300 --> 03:48:07.800]  That's right.
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:08.721]  Isn't that a great statement?
[03:48:08.721 --> 03:48:09.101]  Yes, it is.
[03:48:09.101 --> 03:48:10.803]  It's so great.
[03:48:10.803 --> 03:48:11.683]  It makes a lot of sense.
[03:48:11.683 --> 03:48:12.604]  As a country.
[03:48:12.604 --> 03:48:14.686]  And see, Jim Brown and Trump are synced.
[03:48:14.686 --> 03:48:15.566]  They've been friends for 30 years.
[03:48:15.566 --> 03:48:17.108]  I've never seen Jim Brown impress people.
[03:48:17.108 --> 03:48:17.828]  They're synced up.
[03:48:17.828 --> 03:48:18.629]  He was impressive.
[03:48:18.629 --> 03:48:20.010]  Jim Brown is a badass.
[03:48:20.010 --> 03:48:22.112]  Jim Brown knows Trump well, loves everybody.
[03:48:23.577 --> 03:48:26.460]  Do you think Jim Brown's gonna be intimidated?
[03:48:26.460 --> 03:48:29.983]  The guy used to run over people on a- like, literally run them over.
[03:48:29.983 --> 03:48:31.304]  That was quite something.
[03:48:31.304 --> 03:48:33.005]  That guy's not intimidated by anything.
[03:48:33.005 --> 03:48:36.448]  He just said that.
[03:48:36.448 --> 03:48:37.629]  He dies.
[03:48:37.629 --> 03:48:38.490]  He's a prudent.
[03:48:38.490 --> 03:48:43.354]  When Robert Bowman's body's broken, realize that this is where God is.
[03:48:43.354 --> 03:48:44.615]  He's coming to get it.
[03:48:44.615 --> 03:48:46.176]  And they're not gonna stand in the way of this.
[03:48:46.176 --> 03:48:47.418]  That's why they hate us.
[03:48:48.318 --> 03:48:50.359]  Well, they say this is satanic.
[03:48:50.359 --> 03:48:53.121]  This means interdimensional victory.
[03:48:53.121 --> 03:48:58.183]  This is the symbol of the future.
[03:48:58.183 --> 03:49:00.605]  This doesn't mean bright power.
[03:49:00.605 --> 03:49:03.146]  This means infinity.
[03:49:03.146 --> 03:49:05.347]  This literally means okay in sign language.
[03:49:05.347 --> 03:49:07.809]  The real, they speak the symbol of the future.
[03:49:08.669 --> 03:49:11.532]  We really get caught up in the idea of racism, or the idea of industry.
[03:49:11.532 --> 03:49:13.714]  We think people don't have land, they settle for rent.
[03:49:13.714 --> 03:49:14.315]  We want Obama.
[03:49:14.315 --> 03:49:15.036]  We want land.
[03:49:15.036 --> 03:49:16.998]  We want land because we haven't known how it feels.
[03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:33.553]  This is insanity right there.
[03:49:33.553 --> 03:49:34.274]  Same deal.
[03:49:34.274 --> 03:49:35.195]  Make you wealthy.
[03:49:35.195 --> 03:49:36.095]  Own your own city.
[03:49:36.095 --> 03:49:37.296]  Be successful.
[03:49:37.296 --> 03:49:38.157]  Boom.
[03:49:38.157 --> 03:49:49.146]  Well, and the amazing thing he said there was, he's saying that people buy into the propaganda of making sure they have the coolest brand, like Nike, instead of, oh, I'm going to invest in myself and buy a home or buy land.
[03:49:49.406 --> 03:49:52.428]  No, I'm going to invest in a brand so I can be cool and accepted.
[03:50:06.977 --> 03:50:07.978]  Dumb Negroes, let's finish up.
[03:50:07.978 --> 03:50:10.200]  Exactly, I'm not saying bad cops are, you need to stop killing each other.
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:13.223]  He's trying to fix things.
[03:50:13.223 --> 03:50:14.325]  He's talented, he's talented.
[03:50:29.440 --> 03:50:37.243]  So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they're being forced to do this and forced to do that block and then they force somebody into something and force something.
[03:50:37.243 --> 03:50:43.526]  We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunities.
[03:50:43.526 --> 03:50:48.248]  A lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations at any given point.
[03:50:50.009 --> 03:50:52.830]  Oh, this is racist, this is racist, this is racist, this is racist.
[03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:55.350]  So we don't have a reparation, but we have a 13th Amendment.
[03:50:55.350 --> 03:50:58.271]  We gotta open up the whole conversation.
[03:50:58.271 --> 03:51:03.213]  So, and that's a move, one of the moves that I love that liberals try to do.
[03:51:03.213 --> 03:51:09.854]  The liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud emotional people.
[03:51:09.854 --> 03:51:14.336]  So when I said I like Trump to like someone that's liberal, they'll say, but he's racist.
[03:51:14.336 --> 03:51:16.556]  You think racism can control me?
[03:51:16.556 --> 03:51:19.017]  All I'm doing is- They don't stop me, that's an invisible wall.
[03:51:19.377 --> 03:51:20.617]  They almost came to the studio.
[03:51:20.617 --> 03:51:22.578]  It's like a nuclear reaction.
[03:51:22.578 --> 03:51:24.718]  Imagine Alex Jones, Farrakhan, and Kanye West.
[03:51:43.823 --> 03:51:44.063]  I don't
[03:52:05.390 --> 03:52:07.652]  I would back tax breaks for black people.
[03:52:29.554 --> 03:52:34.256]  You go out and do a business, it's not like, you get some money, get your flag or whatever.
[03:52:34.256 --> 03:52:38.597]  No, no, no, no, because things were done wrong, you talk about reparations.
[03:52:38.597 --> 03:52:43.959]  How about a, a, a, a, what's the Jewish term?
[03:52:43.959 --> 03:52:45.699]  I can't believe it, I know what you're talking about.
[03:52:59.184 --> 03:53:02.087]  What is the biblical principle of forgiving debts?
[03:53:23.104 --> 03:53:29.665]  Mental health and art programs back into the city.
[03:53:29.665 --> 03:53:35.267]  And also, Larry Hoover is an example of a man that was turning his life around.
[03:53:35.267 --> 03:53:39.247]  As soon as he tried to turn his life around, they hit him with six life sentences.
[03:53:39.247 --> 03:53:41.968]  So I believe he's... You say don't tear down the statue.
[03:53:41.968 --> 03:53:44.388]  Larry Hoover is a living statue.
[03:53:44.388 --> 03:53:46.129]  He's a beacon for us.
[03:53:46.129 --> 03:53:46.889]  Jubilee.
[03:53:46.889 --> 03:53:47.489]  Jubilee.
[03:53:47.489 --> 03:53:48.009]  Jubilee.
[03:53:48.009 --> 03:53:48.549]  Jubilee.
[03:53:48.549 --> 03:53:49.029]  Jubilee.
[03:53:49.029 --> 03:53:49.910]  Jubilee.
[03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:50.490]  Jubilee.
[03:53:50.490 --> 03:53:50.970]  Jubilee.
[03:53:50.970 --> 03:53:51.350]  Jubilee.
[03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:55.472]  I would a million percent say half-white.
[03:53:55.472 --> 03:53:57.633]  I did have some images.
[03:53:57.633 --> 03:54:04.637]  Let's get blacks 10 years of tax exemption.
[03:54:04.637 --> 03:54:09.100]  Everybody would invest in those companies so they'd be tax exempt.
[03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:11.201]  The richest people in America would be black.
[03:54:11.201 --> 03:54:12.522]  I'm ready!
[03:54:12.522 --> 03:54:15.544]  You've already given the globalists and the big banks tax exemption.
[03:54:16.144 --> 03:54:17.565]  Give it to black people.
[03:54:17.565 --> 03:54:19.987]  I want reparations right now.
[03:54:19.987 --> 03:54:23.230]  I want a bill, 10 years, black people.
[03:54:23.230 --> 03:54:26.993]  If you're 10% African, you don't pay taxes.
[03:54:26.993 --> 03:54:30.196]  Put that up your ass, Democrats, excuse me.
[03:54:30.196 --> 03:54:31.477]  I'm serious.
[03:54:31.477 --> 03:54:34.740]  And then you imagine all of what happened?
[03:54:34.740 --> 03:54:38.984]  It's not about Democrats handing out, we'll get the taxes and maybe a little bit of money.
[03:54:38.984 --> 03:54:40.005]  They're gonna keep the money.
[03:54:40.005 --> 03:54:43.608]  No, okay, you're African, you've been here for a couple generations.
[03:54:44.048 --> 03:54:44.308]  Yeah.
[03:55:05.743 --> 03:55:06.604]  You're on a journey.
[03:55:06.604 --> 03:55:08.065]  You're on a journey right now.
[03:55:08.065 --> 03:55:11.548]  And you might not have expected to have a crazy mother****** like Kanye West.
[03:55:11.548 --> 03:55:12.810]  Let me tell you, I want support.
[03:55:21.317 --> 03:55:22.718]  Yes, they serve.
[03:55:22.718 --> 03:55:24.159]  They want reparations.
[03:55:24.159 --> 03:55:26.380]  The left wants to sell black people this free deal.
[03:55:26.380 --> 03:55:28.182]  They'll never give it to them.
[03:55:28.182 --> 03:55:34.806]  If someone is at least half African, and can prove they've been here for over 150 years, or 170 years, forget it.
[03:55:34.806 --> 03:55:38.888]  If you have African blood and have been a citizen, tax exemption 10 years.
[03:55:44.512 --> 03:55:45.333]  Oh my god.
[03:55:45.333 --> 03:55:48.677]  Can you imagine what they're going to do today?
[03:55:48.677 --> 03:55:51.440]  Well, I can see the Democrats' reaction.
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:53.823]  No, I'm now for reparations.
[03:55:53.823 --> 03:55:56.206]  I know about taxes being cut basically by exploding.
[03:55:56.206 --> 03:56:01.452]  I'm going to be hiring all these black folks to have them run the company until I get the tax exemption.
[03:56:02.352 --> 03:56:04.514]  No, they get it too, but I get it too.
[03:56:04.514 --> 03:56:05.274]  No, I'm serious.
[03:56:05.274 --> 03:56:07.455]  I just had a genius moment right there.
[03:56:07.455 --> 03:56:08.716]  No, I get it.
[03:56:08.716 --> 03:56:09.216]  I see it.
[03:56:09.216 --> 03:56:11.777]  No, but hearing Kanye is just brainstorming going.
[03:56:11.777 --> 03:56:20.222]  We can benefit on this side, and we can learn how to be malleable in the infinite universe that we are and the loving beings that we are.
[03:56:20.222 --> 03:56:23.424]  Exactly, and then 13% of the population is black.
[03:56:23.424 --> 03:56:26.245]  Make them tax exempt, that'll raise all the country.
[03:56:26.245 --> 03:56:27.086]  We are one country.
[03:56:27.706 --> 03:56:28.807]  I want reparations!
[03:56:28.807 --> 03:56:30.028]  Oh, this is our movement.
[03:56:30.028 --> 03:56:30.688]  I'm not kidding.
[03:56:30.688 --> 03:56:32.289]  I'm not kidding.
[03:56:32.289 --> 03:56:35.051]  Anybody that's been here, they can prove they've even been here.
[03:56:35.051 --> 03:56:35.591]  They're family.
[03:56:35.591 --> 03:56:36.532]  They're citizens.
[03:56:36.532 --> 03:56:41.635]  If you're African descent, you get ten years to answer this question.
[03:56:41.635 --> 03:56:42.615]  You're in the Oval Office.
[03:56:46.017 --> 03:56:47.398]  It is good energy in this.
[03:56:47.398 --> 03:56:48.499]  Isn't it good energy?
[03:56:48.499 --> 03:56:49.179]  It's good energy.
[03:56:49.179 --> 03:56:50.720]  It's a great place, Jim.
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:51.821]  See, that's all Trump talks about.
[03:56:51.821 --> 03:56:52.662]  It's all about energy.
[03:56:52.662 --> 03:56:54.323]  I have a little secret.
[03:56:54.323 --> 03:56:55.664]  Thank you, too.
[03:56:55.664 --> 03:56:57.405]  You're so respected.
[03:56:57.405 --> 03:56:58.585]  And what Kanye's doing.
[03:56:58.585 --> 03:57:00.006]  All right, folks, we're out of time.
[03:57:00.006 --> 03:57:00.627]  All over the world.
[03:57:00.627 --> 03:57:02.608]  I'll cover this all tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:57:02.608 --> 03:57:03.849]  David, I'll cover it before that.
[03:57:03.849 --> 03:57:06.270]  Owen at 3.
[03:57:06.270 --> 03:57:08.412]  Actually, I just had the epiphany.
[03:57:08.412 --> 03:57:09.873]  I'm calling for reparations right now.
[03:57:10.834 --> 03:57:12.194]  Cut the taxes.
[03:57:12.194 --> 03:57:14.955]  I think black Americans should have 10 years of no taxes.
[03:57:14.955 --> 03:57:15.575]  Quit, quit.
[03:57:15.575 --> 03:57:16.656]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:57:16.656 --> 03:57:17.316]  I mean that.
[03:57:17.316 --> 03:57:18.776]  This is, it's true.
[03:57:18.776 --> 03:57:20.697]  I'm now for reparations.
[03:57:20.697 --> 03:57:22.017]  I'm serious.
[03:57:22.017 --> 03:57:25.918]  We're going to launch anyone of African descent that's a citizen.
[03:57:25.918 --> 03:57:27.599]  Oh my God.
[03:57:27.599 --> 03:57:31.020]  This is going to change.
[03:57:31.020 --> 03:57:33.920]  This is going to change the whole world.
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:34.501]  God bless y'all.
[03:57:34.501 --> 03:57:36.541]  Thank you.
[03:57:36.541 --> 03:57:37.962]  Anybody that's black and American.
[03:57:37.962 --> 03:57:38.842]  Good energy.
[03:57:38.842 --> 03:57:39.302]  Good energy.
[03:57:43.178 --> 03:57:43.198]  X2.
[03:58:13.778 --> 03:58:16.199]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[03:58:16.199 --> 03:58:17.900]  Ordered it six months ago.
[03:58:17.900 --> 03:58:18.921]  So I get the price down.
[03:58:18.921 --> 03:58:20.641]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[03:58:20.641 --> 03:58:21.622]  I'm breaking the contract.
[03:58:21.622 --> 03:58:23.863]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[03:58:23.863 --> 03:58:26.244]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[03:58:26.244 --> 03:58:28.025]  In fact, right now, it is the last run.
[03:58:28.025 --> 03:58:30.045]  The Survival Shield X2.
[03:58:30.045 --> 03:58:31.526]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[03:58:31.526 --> 03:58:33.507]  It'll be gone in a couple months.

[03:58:44.073 --> 03:58:46.434]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:58:46.434 --> 03:58:53.018]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[03:58:53.018 --> 03:58:57.000]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[03:58:57.000 --> 03:59:00.422]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development.

[03:59:10.467 --> 03:59:21.972]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[03:59:22.452 --> 03:59:31.734]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
